Gestures include movement of the [[hand]]s, [[face]], or other parts of the [[Human body|body]]. Gestures differ from physical non-verbal communication that does not communicate specific messages, such as purely [[Emotional expression|expressive]] displays, [[proxemics]], or displays of [[joint attention]].<ref name=Kendon>Kendon, Adam.

Performance scholar Carrie Noland describes gestures as \"learned techniques of the body\" and stresses the way gestures are embodied corporeal forms of cultural communication.<ref>Noland, Carrie. ''Agency and Embodiment : Performing Gestures/producing Culture''. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 2009. p. 2.\n</ref> But rather than just residing within one cultural context, she describes how gestures migrate across bodies and locations to create new cultural meanings and associations. She also posits how they might function as a form of \"resistance to homogenization\" because they are so dependent on the specification of the bodies that perform them.<ref>Noland, Carrie. \"Introduction.\" ''Migration of Gesture''. Ed. Carrie Noland and Sally Ann Ness. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 2008. p. x.\n</ref>\n\nGesture has also been taken up within [[queer theory]], [[ethnic studies]] and their intersections in [[performance studies]], as a way to think about how the moving body gains social meaning. [[Jos\u00e9 Esteban Mu\u00f1oz]] uses the idea of gesture to mark a kind of refusal of finitude and certainty and links gesture to his ideas of ephemera. [[Jos\u00e9 Esteban Mu\u00f1oz|Mu\u00f1oz]] specifically draws on the African-American dancer and [[drag queen]] performer [[Kevin Aviance]] to articulate his interest not in what queer gestures might mean, but what they might perform.<ref>Mu\u00f1oz, Jos\u00e9 Esteban.

''Sexual Futures, Queer Gestures, and Other Latina Longings''. New York: NYU Press, 2014. \n</ref>\n\nWithin the field of linguistics, the most hotly contested aspect of gesture revolves around the subcategory of Lexical or Iconic Co-Speech Gestures. Adam Kendon was the first linguist to hypothesize on their purpose when he argued that Lexical gestures do work to amplify or modulate the lexico-semantic content of the verbal speech with which they co-occur.<ref name=\"Kendon\" /> However, since the late 1990s, most research has revolved around the contrasting hypothesis that Lexical gestures serve a primarily cognitive purpose in aiding the process of speech production.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\" /> As of 2012, there is research to suggest that Lexical Gesture does indeed serve a primarily communicative purpose and cognitive only secondary, but in the realm of socio-pragmatic communication, rather than lexico-semantic modification.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n==Typology (categories)==\n[[File:Unclesamwantyou.jpg|right|thumb|250px|[[Pointing]] at another person with an extended finger is considered rude in many cultures.]]\n\nHumans have the ability to communicate through language, but they can also express through gestures.

While most gestures can be defined as possibly happening during the course of spoken utterances, the informative-communicative dichotomy focuses on intentionality of meaning and communication in co-speech gesture.<ref name=\":12\" />\n\n==== Informative (Passive Gestures) ====\nInformative gestures are passive gestures that provide information about the speaker as a person and not about what the speaker is trying to communicate. Some movements are not purely considered gestures, however a person could perform these adapters in such way like scratching, adjusting clothing, and tapping.'''<ref>{{Cite book |doi=10.1016/S0065-2601(08)60241-5|chapter=Nonverbal Behavior and Nonverbal Communication: What do Conversational Hand Gestures Tell Us?|title=Advances in Experimental Social Psychology Volume 28|volume=28|pages=389\u2013450|series=Advances in Experimental Social Psychology|year=1996|last1=Krauss|first1=Robert M.|last2=Chen|first2=Yihsiu|last3=Chawla|first3=Purnima|isbn=9780120152285}}</ref>'''\n\nThese gestures can occur during speech, but they may also occur independently of communication, as they are not a part of active communication. While informative gestures may communicate information about the person speaking (e.g. itchy, uncomfortable, etc.), this communication is not engaged with any language being produced by the person gesturing.<ref name=\":12\" />\n\n==== Communicative (Active Gestures) ====\nCommunicative gestures are gestures that are produced intentionally and meaningfully by a person as a way of intensifying or modifying speech produced in the vocal tract (or with the hands in the case of sign languages), even though a speaker may not be actively aware that they are producing communicative gestures.<ref name=\":12\" /> For instance, on the picture above of Uncle Sam, he is pointing and sending a non-verbal form of gesture by implying he wants you to join the U.S. Army. This is a form of symbolic gesture, usually used in the absence of speech.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n== Body language relating to gestures ==\nBody language is a form of [[Nonverbal communication|non-verbal communication]] that allows visual cues that transmit messages without speaking. Gestures are movement that are made with the body: arms, hands, facial,  etc.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last=Tipper|first=Christine M.|last2=Signorini|first2=Giulia|last3=Grafton|first3=Scott T.|date=2015-08-21|title=Body language in the brain: constructing meaning from expressive movement|journal=Frontiers in Human Neuroscience|volume=9|pages=450|doi=10.3389/fnhum.2015.00450|issn=1662-5161|pmc=4543892|pmid=26347635}}</ref> Authors Barbara Pease and Allan Pease, of \"[[The Definitive Book of Body Language]]\" concluded that everyone does a shoulder shrug, a gesture signifying that the person is not comprehending what they are supposed to be understanding.

''The Definitive Book of Body Language'', 2006.

Interesting, the book explains that people who are born deaf can show a form of submissive gesture to signify \"Yes\".<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n== Manual vs. non-manual communicative gestures ==\nWithin the realm of communicative gestures, the first distinction to be made is between gestures made with the hands and arms, and gestures made with other parts of the body. Examples of Non-manual gestures may include head [[Nod (gesture)|nodding]] and [[Head shake|shaking]], [[Shrug|shoulder shrugging]], and [[facial expression]], among others. Non-manual gestures are attested in languages all around the world, but have not been the primary focus of most research regarding co-speech gesture.<ref name=\":12\" />\n\n=== Manual gestures ===\n\nA gesture that is a form of communication in which bodily actions communicate particular messages. Manual gestures are most commonly broken down into four distinct categories: Symbolic (Emblematic), [[Deixis|Deictic]] (Indexical), Motor (Beat), and Lexical (Iconic)<ref name=\":0\" /> It is important to note that manual gesture in the sense of communicative co-speech gesture does not include the gesture-signs of [[Sign language|Sign Language]]<nowiki/>s, even though sign language is communicative and primarily produced using the hands, because the gestures in [[Sign language|Sign Language]] are not used to intensify or modify the speech produced by the vocal tract, rather they communicate fully productive language through a method alternative to the [[vocal tract]].\n\n==== Symbolic (emblematic) ====\n{{Main|List of gestures}}The most familiar are the so-called emblems or quotable gestures. These are conventional, culture-specific gestures that can be used as replacement for words, such as the handwave used in the US for \"hello\" and \"goodbye\". A single emblematic gesture can have a very different significance in different cultural contexts, ranging from complimentary to highly offensive.<ref>Morris, Desmond, Collett, Peter, Marsh, Peter, O'Shaughnessy, Marie. 1979. Gestures, their origins and distribution. London. Cape</ref> The page [[List of gestures]] discusses emblematic gestures made with one hand, two hands, hand and other body parts, and body and facial gestures.\n\nSymbolic gestures can occur either concurrently or independently of vocal speech. Symbolic gestures are iconic gestures that are widely recognized, fixed, and have conventionalized meanings.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Krauss |display-authors=etal |first=Robert M.|year=2001|title=Lexical Gestures and Lexical Access: A Process Model|url=|journal=Book: Language and Gesture by D. McNeill (Ed.) New York: Cambridge University Press|volume=|pages=261\u2013283|via=}}</ref>\n\n==== Deictic (indexical) ====\nDeictic gestures can occur simultaneously with vocal speech or in place of it. Deictic gestures are gestures that consist of indicative or [[pointing]] motions. These gestures often work in the same way as demonstrative words and pronouns like \"this\" or \"that\".<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nDeictic gestures can refer to concrete or intangible objects or people.\n\n====Motor (beat)====\n\nMotor or beat gestures usually consist of short, repetitive, rhythmic movements that are closely tied with [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] in verbal speech. Unlike symbolic and deictic gestures, beat gestures cannot occur independently of verbal speech and convey no semantic information. For example, some people wave their hands as they speak to emphasize a certain word or phrase.\n\nThese gestures are closely coordinated with speech. The so-called beat gestures are used in conjunction with speech and keep time with the rhythm of speech to emphasize certain words or phrases. These types of gestures are integrally connected to [[Speech communication|speech]] and thought processes.<ref name=\"McNeill\" />\n\n====Lexical (iconic)====\n\nOther spontaneous gestures used during speech production known as iconic gestures are more full of content, and may echo, or elaborate, the meaning of the co-occurring speech. They depict aspects of spatial images, actions, people, or objects.<ref name=\"mayberry\">{{cite journal|last=Mayberry|first=Rachel I.|title=Gesture Reflects Language Development: Evidence from Bilingual Children|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|date=December 2000|volume=9|issue=6|pages=192\u2013196|jstor=20182668|doi=10.1111/1467-8721.00092}}</ref> For example, a gesture that depicts the act of throwing may be synchronous with the utterance, \"He threw the ball right into the window.\"<ref name=McNeill>McNeill (1992).

This can be achieved through various gestures such as by demonstrating a shiver and/or by rubbing the hands together. In such cases, the language or verbal description of the person does not necessarily need to be understood as someone could at least take a hint at what's being communicated through the observation and interpretation of body language which serves as a gesture equivalent in meaning to what's being said through communicative speech.\n\nThe elaboration of lexical gestures falls on a spectrum of iconic-metaphorical in how closely tied they are to the lexico-semantic content of the verbal speech they coordinate with. More iconic gesture very obviously mirrors the words being spoken (such as drawing a jagged horizontal line in the air to describe mountains) whereas more metaphorical gestures clearly contain some spatial relation to the semantic content of the co-occurring verbal speech, but the relationship between the gesture and the speech might be more ambiguous.\n\nLexical gestures, like motor gestures, cannot occur independently of verbal speech. The purpose of lexical gestures is still widely contested in the literature with some linguists arguing that lexical gestures serve to amplify or modulate the semantic content of lexical speech,<ref name=\"Kendon\" /> or that it serves a cognitive purpose in aiding in lexical access and retrieval<ref name=\":0\" /> or verbal working memory.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Gillespie |display-authors=etal |first=Maureen|year=2014|title=Verbal Working Memory Predicts Co-Speech Gesture: Evidence from Individual Differences|url=|journal=Cognition|volume=132|issue=2|pages=174\u2013180|doi=10.1016/j.cognition.2014.03.012|pmid=24813571|pmc=4066192}}</ref> Most recent research suggests that lexical gestures serve a primarily socio-pragmatic role.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Holler |display-authors=etal |first=Judith|year=2012|title=It's On the Tip of My Fingers: Co-speech Gestures During Lexical Retrieval in Different Social Contexts|url=|journal=Language and Cognitive Processes|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\n==Language development==\n\nStudies affirm a strong link between gesture typology and [[language development]]. Young children under the age of two seem to rely on pointing gestures to refer to objects that they do not know the names of. Once the words are learned, they eschewed those referential (pointing) gestures. One would think that the use of gesture would decrease as the child develops spoken language, but results reveal that gesture frequency increased as speaking frequency increased with age. There is, however, a change in gesture typology at different ages, suggesting a connection between gestures and language development. Children most often use pointing and adults rely more on iconic and beat gestures. As children begin producing sentence-like utterances, they also begin producing new kinds of gestures that adults use when speaking (iconics and beats). Evidence of this systematic organization of gesture is indicative of its association to language development.<ref name=\"mayberry\"/>\n\nGestural languages such as [[American Sign Language]] and its regional siblings operate as complete natural languages that are gestural in modality. They should not be confused with [[finger spelling]], in which a set of emblematic gestures are used to represent a written alphabet. American sign language is different from gesturing in that concepts are modeled by certain hand motions or expressions and has a specific established structure while gesturing is more malleable and has no specific structure rather it supplements speech. Before an established sign language was created in Nicaragua after the 1970s, deaf communities would use \"home signs\" in order to communicate with each other. These home signs were not part of a unified language but were still used as familiar motions and expressions used within their family\u2014still closely related to language rather than gestures with no specific structure.<ref>{{cite book|last=Fernandez|first=Eva M.|title=Fundamentals of Psycholinguistics|year=2011|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=9781405191470|page=77|author2=Helen Smith Cairns}}</ref> This is similar to what has been observed in the gestural actions of chimpanzees. Gestures are used by these animals in place of verbal language, which is restricted in animals due to their lacking certain physiological and articulation abilities that humans have for speech. Corballis (2009) asserts that \"our hominid ancestors were better pre-adapted to acquire language-like competence using manual gestures than using vocal sounds.\"<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Corballis | first1 = M.

Different cultures use similar gestures when talking about a specific action such as how we gesture the idea of drinking out of a cup.<ref name=\"VASC, Dermina 2013\" />\n\nWhen an individual makes a gesture, another person can understand because of recognition of the actions/shapes.<ref name=\"VASC, Dermina 2013\" />\n\nGestures have been documented in the arts such as in Greek vase paintings, [[Indian painting|Indian Miniatures]] or European paintings.\n\nAn example, [[Vitarka-vicara|Vitarka Vicara,]] the gesture of discussion and transmission of Buddhist teaching. It is done by joining the tips of the thumb and the index together, while keeping the other fingers straight.\n\n==Neurology==\n\nGestures are processed in the same areas of the brain as [[speech]] and [[sign language]] such as the left [[inferior frontal gyrus]] ([[Broca's area]]) and the posterior [[middle temporal gyrus]], posterior [[superior temporal sulcus]] and [[superior temporal gyrus]] ([[Wernicke's area]]).<ref name=\"Xu\"/> It has been suggested that these parts of the brain originally supported the pairing of gesture and meaning and then were adapted in [[human evolution]] \"for the comparable pairing of sound and meaning as voluntary control over the vocal apparatus was established and spoken language evolved\".<ref name=\"Xu\"/> As a result, it underlies both symbolic gesture and spoken language in the present [[human brain]]. Their common neurological basis also supports the idea that symbolic gesture and spoken language are two parts of a single fundamental semiotic system that underlies human discourse.<ref name=McNeill/>\nThe linkage of hand and body gestures in conjunction with speech is further revealed by the nature of gesture use in blind individuals during conversation. This phenomenon uncovers a function of gesture that goes beyond portraying communicative content of language and extends [[David McNeill]]'s view of the gesture-speech system. This suggests that gesture and speech work tightly together, and a disruption of one (speech or gesture) will cause a problem in the other. Studies have found strong evidence that speech and gesture are innately linked in the brain and work in an efficiently wired and choreographed system. McNeill's view of this linkage in the brain is just one of three currently up for debate; the others declaring gesture to be a \"support system\" of spoken language or a physical mechanism for lexical retrieval.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Iverson |first=Jana M. |author2=Esther Thelen |title=Hand, Mouth and Brain |journal=Journal of Consciousness Studies |year=2005 |url=http://cspeech.ucd.ie/~fred/docs/IversonThelen.pdf |accessdate=1 October 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004215359/http://cspeech.ucd.ie/~fred/docs/IversonThelen.pdf |archivedate=4 October 2013 }}</ref>\n\nBecause of this connection of co-speech gestures\u2014a form of manual action\u2014in language in the brain, Roel Willems and Peter Hagoort conclude that both gestures and language contribute to the understanding and decoding of a speaker's encoded message. Willems and Hagoort's research suggest that \"processing evoked by gestures is qualitatively similar to that of words at the level of semantic processing.\" This conclusion is supported through findings from experiments by Skipper where the use of gestures led to \"a division of labor between areas related to language or action (Broca's area and premotor/primary motor cortex respectively)\", The use of gestures in combination with speech allowed the brain to decrease the need for \"semantic control\", Because gestures aided in understanding the relayed message, there was not as great a need for semantic selection or control that would otherwise be required of the listener through [[Broca's area]]. Gestures are a way to represent the thoughts of an individual, which are prompted in working memory. The results of an experiment revealed that adults have increased accuracy when they used pointing gestures as opposed to simply counting in their heads (without the use of pointing gestures)<ref name=\"VASC, Dermina 2013\"/> Furthermore, the results of a study conducted by Marstaller and Burianov\u00e1 suggest that the use of gestures affect working memory. The researchers found that those with low capacity of working memory who were able to use gestures actually recalled more terms than those with low capacity who were not able to use gestures.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Marstaller | first1 = Lars | last2 = Burianov\u00e1 | first2 = Hana | year = 2013 | title = Individual differences in the gesture effect on working memory | url = | journal = Psychonomic Society | volume = 20 | issue = | pages = 496\u2013500 }}</ref>\n\nAlthough there is an obvious connection in the aid of gestures in understanding a message, \"the understanding of gestures is not the same as understanding spoken language.\" These two functions work together and gestures help facilitate understanding, but they only \"partly drive the neural language system\".<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Willems | first1 = Roel M. | last2 = Hagoort | first2 = Peter | year = 2007 | title = Neural Evidence for the Interplay between Language, Gesture, and Action: A Review | url = | journal = Brain and Language | volume = 101 | issue = 3| pages = 14\u20136 | doi=10.1016/j.bandl.2007.03.004| pmid = 17416411 | hdl = 11858/00-001M-0000-0013-198D-E }}</ref>\n\n==Electronic interface==\n{{Main|Gesture recognition}}\nThe movement of gestures can be used to interact with technology like computers, using [[Touch user interface|touch]] or [[multi-touch]] popularised by the [[iPhone]], physical [[Motion detection|movement detection]] and visual [[motion capture]], used in [[video game console]]s.\n\nIt can be recorded using kinematic methodology.\n\n== Kendon's continuum ==\nIn order to better understand the linguistic values that gestures hold, Adam Kendon, a pioneer in gesture research has proposed to look at it as a continuum from less linguistic to fully linguistic. Using the continuum, speech declines as \"the language-like properties of gestural behaviors increase and idiosyncratic gestures are replaced by socially regulated signs\".<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nGestures of different kinds fall within this continuum and include spontaneous gesticulations, language-like gestures, pantomime, emblems, and sign language.

Adam Kendon was the first linguist to hypothesize on their purpose when he argued that Lexical gestures do work to amplify or modulate the lexico-semantic content of the verbal speech with which they co-occur.<ref name=\"Kendon\" /> However, since the late 1990s, most research has revolved around the contrasting hypothesis that Lexical gestures serve a primarily cognitive purpose in aiding the process of speech production.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\" /> As of 2012, there is research to suggest that Lexical Gesture does indeed serve a primarily communicative purpose and cognitive only secondary, but in the realm of socio-pragmatic communication, rather than lexico-semantic modification.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n==Typology (categories)==\n[[File:Unclesamwantyou.jpg|right|thumb|250px|[[Pointing]] at another person with an extended finger is considered rude in many cultures.]]\n\nHumans have the ability to communicate through language, but they can also express through gestures.

Some movements are not purely considered gestures, however a person could perform these adapters in such way like scratching, adjusting clothing, and tapping.'''<ref>{{Cite book |doi=10.1016/S0065-2601(08)60241-5|chapter=Nonverbal Behavior and Nonverbal Communication: What do Conversational Hand Gestures Tell Us?|title=Advances in Experimental Social Psychology Volume 28|volume=28|pages=389\u2013450|series=Advances in Experimental Social Psychology|year=1996|last1=Krauss|first1=Robert M.|last2=Chen|first2=Yihsiu|last3=Chawla|first3=Purnima|isbn=9780120152285}}</ref>'''\n\nThese gestures can occur during speech, but they may also occur independently of communication, as they are not a part of active communication. While informative gestures may communicate information about the person speaking (e.g. itchy, uncomfortable, etc.), this communication is not engaged with any language being produced by the person gesturing.<ref name=\":12\" />\n\n==== Communicative (Active Gestures) ====\nCommunicative gestures are gestures that are produced intentionally and meaningfully by a person as a way of intensifying or modifying speech produced in the vocal tract (or with the hands in the case of sign languages), even though a speaker may not be actively aware that they are producing communicative gestures.<ref name=\":12\" /> For instance, on the picture above of Uncle Sam, he is pointing and sending a non-verbal form of gesture by implying he wants you to join the U.S. Army.

Examples of Non-manual gestures may include head [[Nod (gesture)|nodding]] and [[Head shake|shaking]], [[Shrug|shoulder shrugging]], and [[facial expression]], among others. Non-manual gestures are attested in languages all around the world, but have not been the primary focus of most research regarding co-speech gesture.<ref name=\":12\" />\n\n=== Manual gestures ===\n\nA gesture that is a form of communication in which bodily actions communicate particular messages. Manual gestures are most commonly broken down into four distinct categories: Symbolic (Emblematic), [[Deixis|Deictic]] (Indexical), Motor (Beat), and Lexical (Iconic)<ref name=\":0\" /> It is important to note that manual gesture in the sense of communicative co-speech gesture does not include the gesture-signs of [[Sign language|Sign Language]]<nowiki/>s, even though sign language is communicative and primarily produced using the hands, because the gestures in [[Sign language|Sign Language]] are not used to intensify or modify the speech produced by the vocal tract, rather they communicate fully productive language through a method alternative to the [[vocal tract]].\n\n==== Symbolic (emblematic) ====\n{{Main|List of gestures}}The most familiar are the so-called emblems or quotable gestures. These are conventional, culture-specific gestures that can be used as replacement for words, such as the handwave used in the US for \"hello\" and \"goodbye\". A single emblematic gesture can have a very different significance in different cultural contexts, ranging from complimentary to highly offensive.<ref>Morris, Desmond, Collett, Peter, Marsh, Peter, O'Shaughnessy, Marie. 1979. Gestures, their origins and distribution. London. Cape</ref> The page [[List of gestures]] discusses emblematic gestures made with one hand, two hands, hand and other body parts, and body and facial gestures.\n\nSymbolic gestures can occur either concurrently or independently of vocal speech.

Deictic gestures are gestures that consist of indicative or [[pointing]] motions. These gestures often work in the same way as demonstrative words and pronouns like \"this\" or \"that\".<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nDeictic gestures can refer to concrete or intangible objects or people.\n\n====Motor (beat)====\n\nMotor or beat gestures usually consist of short, repetitive, rhythmic movements that are closely tied with [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] in verbal speech. Unlike symbolic and deictic gestures, beat gestures cannot occur independently of verbal speech and convey no semantic information. For example, some people wave their hands as they speak to emphasize a certain word or phrase.\n\nThese gestures are closely coordinated with speech. The so-called beat gestures are used in conjunction with speech and keep time with the rhythm of speech to emphasize certain words or phrases. These types of gestures are integrally connected to [[Speech communication|speech]] and thought processes.<ref name=\"McNeill\" />\n\n====Lexical (iconic)====\n\nOther spontaneous gestures used during speech production known as iconic gestures are more full of content, and may echo, or elaborate, the meaning of the co-occurring speech. They depict aspects of spatial images, actions, people, or objects.<ref name=\"mayberry\">{{cite journal|last=Mayberry|first=Rachel I.|title=Gesture Reflects Language Development: Evidence from Bilingual Children|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|date=December 2000|volume=9|issue=6|pages=192\u2013196|jstor=20182668|doi=10.1111/1467-8721.00092}}</ref> For example, a gesture that depicts the act of throwing may be synchronous with the utterance, \"He threw the ball right into the window.\"<ref name=McNeill>McNeill (1992).

This can be achieved through various gestures such as by demonstrating a shiver and/or by rubbing the hands together. In such cases, the language or verbal description of the person does not necessarily need to be understood as someone could at least take a hint at what's being communicated through the observation and interpretation of body language which serves as a gesture equivalent in meaning to what's being said through communicative speech.\n\nThe elaboration of lexical gestures falls on a spectrum of iconic-metaphorical in how closely tied they are to the lexico-semantic content of the verbal speech they coordinate with. More iconic gesture very obviously mirrors the words being spoken (such as drawing a jagged horizontal line in the air to describe mountains) whereas more metaphorical gestures clearly contain some spatial relation to the semantic content of the co-occurring verbal speech, but the relationship between the gesture and the speech might be more ambiguous.\n\nLexical gestures, like motor gestures, cannot occur independently of verbal speech. The purpose of lexical gestures is still widely contested in the literature with some linguists arguing that lexical gestures serve to amplify or modulate the semantic content of lexical speech,<ref name=\"Kendon\" /> or that it serves a cognitive purpose in aiding in lexical access and retrieval<ref name=\":0\" /> or verbal working memory.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Gillespie |display-authors=etal |first=Maureen|year=2014|title=Verbal Working Memory Predicts Co-Speech Gesture: Evidence from Individual Differences|url=|journal=Cognition|volume=132|issue=2|pages=174\u2013180|doi=10.1016/j.cognition.2014.03.012|pmid=24813571|pmc=4066192}}</ref> Most recent research suggests that lexical gestures serve a primarily socio-pragmatic role.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Holler |display-authors=etal |first=Judith|year=2012|title=It's On the Tip of My Fingers: Co-speech Gestures During Lexical Retrieval in Different Social Contexts|url=|journal=Language and Cognitive Processes|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\n==Language development==\n\nStudies affirm a strong link between gesture typology and [[language development]]. Young children under the age of two seem to rely on pointing gestures to refer to objects that they do not know the names of. Once the words are learned, they eschewed those referential (pointing) gestures. One would think that the use of gesture would decrease as the child develops spoken language, but results reveal that gesture frequency increased as speaking frequency increased with age. There is, however, a change in gesture typology at different ages, suggesting a connection between gestures and language development. Children most often use pointing and adults rely more on iconic and beat gestures. As children begin producing sentence-like utterances, they also begin producing new kinds of gestures that adults use when speaking (iconics and beats). Evidence of this systematic organization of gesture is indicative of its association to language development.<ref name=\"mayberry\"/>\n\nGestural languages such as [[American Sign Language]] and its regional siblings operate as complete natural languages that are gestural in modality. They should not be confused with [[finger spelling]], in which a set of emblematic gestures are used to represent a written alphabet. American sign language is different from gesturing in that concepts are modeled by certain hand motions or expressions and has a specific established structure while gesturing is more malleable and has no specific structure rather it supplements speech. Before an established sign language was created in Nicaragua after the 1970s, deaf communities would use \"home signs\" in order to communicate with each other. These home signs were not part of a unified language but were still used as familiar motions and expressions used within their family\u2014still closely related to language rather than gestures with no specific structure.<ref>{{cite book|last=Fernandez|first=Eva M.|title=Fundamentals of Psycholinguistics|year=2011|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=9781405191470|page=77|author2=Helen Smith Cairns}}</ref> This is similar to what has been observed in the gestural actions of chimpanzees. Gestures are used by these animals in place of verbal language, which is restricted in animals due to their lacking certain physiological and articulation abilities that humans have for speech. Corballis (2009) asserts that \"our hominid ancestors were better pre-adapted to acquire language-like competence using manual gestures than using vocal sounds.\"<ref>Corballis, M. C.

Proper body language etiquette in business dealings can be crucial for success.  However, gestures can have different meanings according to the country in which they are expressed. In an age of global business, diplomatic cultural sensitivity has become a necessity. Gestures that we take as innocent may be seen by someone else as deeply insulting.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\nThe following gestures are examples of proper etiquette with respect to different countries\u2019 customs on salutations:\n\n* In the [[United States]], \"a firm handshake, accompanied by direct eye contact, is the standard greeting.

When presenting, one holds the business card with both hands, grasping it between the thumbs and forefingers. The presentation is to be accompanied by a slight bow.

This is seen as a sign of disrespect\".\n* In [[France]], \"a light, quick handshake is common.  To offer a strong, pumping handshake would be considered uncultured.

Gestures are a crucial part of everyday conversation such as chatting, describing a route, negotiating prices on a market; they are ubiquitous.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\nAdditionally, when people use gestures, there is a certain shared background knowledge. Different cultures use similar gestures when talking about a specific action such as how we gesture the idea of drinking out of a cup.<ref name=\"VASC, Dermina 2013\" />\n\nWhen an individual makes a gesture, another person can understand because of recognition of the actions/shapes.<ref name=\"VASC, Dermina 2013\" />\n\nGestures have been documented in the arts such as in Greek vase paintings, [[Indian painting|Indian Miniatures]] or European paintings.\n\nAn example, [[Vitarka-vicara|Vitarka Vicara,]] the gesture of discussion and transmission of Buddhist teaching. It is done by joining the tips of the thumb and the index together, while keeping the other fingers straight.\n\n==Neurology==\n\nGestures are processed in the same areas of the brain as [[speech]] and [[sign language]] such as the left [[inferior frontal gyrus]] ([[Broca's area]]) and the posterior [[middle temporal gyrus]], posterior [[superior temporal sulcus]] and [[superior temporal gyrus]] ([[Wernicke's area]]).<ref name=\"Xu\"/> It has been suggested that these parts of the brain originally supported the pairing of gesture and meaning and then were adapted in [[human evolution]] \"for the comparable pairing of sound and meaning as voluntary control over the vocal apparatus was established and spoken language evolved\".<ref name=\"Xu\"/> As a result, it underlies both symbolic gesture and spoken language in the present [[human brain]]. Their common neurological basis also supports the idea that symbolic gesture and spoken language are two parts of a single fundamental semiotic system that underlies human discourse.<ref name=McNeill/>\nThe linkage of hand and body gestures in conjunction with speech is further revealed by the nature of gesture use in blind individuals during conversation. This phenomenon uncovers a function of gesture that goes beyond portraying communicative content of language and extends [[David McNeill]]'s view of the gesture-speech system. This suggests that gesture and speech work tightly together, and a disruption of one (speech or gesture) will cause a problem in the other. Studies have found strong evidence that speech and gesture are innately linked in the brain and work in an efficiently wired and choreographed system. McNeill's view of this linkage in the brain is just one of three currently up for debate; the others declaring gesture to be a \"support system\" of spoken language or a physical mechanism for lexical retrieval.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Iverson |first=Jana M. |author2=Esther Thelen |title=Hand, Mouth and Brain |journal=Journal of Consciousness Studies |year=2005 |url=http://cspeech.ucd.ie/~fred/docs/IversonThelen.pdf |accessdate=1 October 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004215359/http://cspeech.ucd.ie/~fred/docs/IversonThelen.pdf |archivedate=4 October 2013 }}</ref>\n\nBecause of this connection of co-speech gestures\u2014a form of manual action\u2014in language in the brain, Roel Willems and Peter Hagoort conclude that both gestures and language contribute to the understanding and decoding of a speaker's encoded message. Willems and Hagoort's research suggest that \"processing evoked by gestures is qualitatively similar to that of words at the level of semantic processing.\" This conclusion is supported through findings from experiments by Skipper where the use of gestures led to \"a division of labor between areas related to language or action (Broca's area and premotor/primary motor cortex respectively)\", The use of gestures in combination with speech allowed the brain to decrease the need for \"semantic control\", Because gestures aided in understanding the relayed message, there was not as great a need for semantic selection or control that would otherwise be required of the listener through [[Broca's area]]. Gestures are a way to represent the thoughts of an individual, which are prompted in working memory. The results of an experiment revealed that adults have increased accuracy when they used pointing gestures as opposed to simply counting in their heads (without the use of pointing gestures)<ref name=\"VASC, Dermina 2013\"/> Furthermore, the results of a study conducted by Marstaller and Burianov\u00e1 suggest that the use of gestures affect working memory. The researchers found that those with low capacity of working memory who were able to use gestures actually recalled more terms than those with low capacity who were not able to use gestures.<ref>Marstaller, Lars and Hana Burianov\u00e1. \"Individual differences in the gesture effect on working memory.\"Psychonomic Society 20 (2013): 496-500.

As with the Burns series that came before it, each model has several versions with different factory specifications to suit specific budgets and skill levels. The first generation (MP3/MP4), now referred to as the \"classic Inferno\", was produced from late 1991 to the end of 1996 and won every [[International Federation of Model Auto Racing|IFMAR world championship]] during its production run. With 8 [[International Federation of Model Auto Racing|IFMAR]] titles under its belt, the Kyosho Inferno has been the most successful RC car in its scale and deserves the \"fire\" themed brand name which has been in use since the release of the [[Kyosho Burns]] in 1988. <ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== General history ==\n\n=== Background ===\nThe first generation of Infernos were produced from late 1991 to 1996 and shared only a few parts with its predecessor the [[Kyosho Burns|Kyosho Turbo Burns]]. The Inferno was almost a complete redesign based on experiences in competition to increase performance, durability and ease of maintenance.  Any similarity with the Burns series of cars was lost with the introduction of the Inferno MP5 in 1995 which introduced design <u>characteristics</u> which can still be found in the current MP10 more than 20 years later.   \n\nWith the introduction of the Inferno, [[Kyosho]] also chose to sell partially assembled, entry-level kits and introduced their own line of budget GS engines.\n\nAs with the Burns predecessor, it was possible to start with the most affordable car and upgrade to a full option, competition-ready vehicle when the skill and budget allowed. Alternatively one could also buy a competition car for far less than the cost of the individual optional parts.\n\nIt is often not known that the MP (Model Project) nomenclature, which is synonymous with Kyosho buggies from the MP5 onward, was already in use at [[Kyosho]] for the [[Kyosho Burns|Burns series]] and first Inferno series of cars. Burns MP1, Turbo Burns MP2, Inferno MP3, Turbo Inferno MP4.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe versatility of this platform also enabled Kyosho to create 1:8 scale road and rally cars called the \"Super Eight GP LANDMAX 4WD\"<ref name=\":10\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.classic.rc-junkies.net/?p=549|title=Kyosho Landmax history|website=www.classic.rc-junkies.net}}</ref> and the Inferno ST (Stadium Truck) series. The Landmax were based on the original Inferno chassis until 2001, and then the Inferno MP7.5 chassis until 2008. The ST series is still going strong today although the components used bare little resemblance to the current Inferno buggy. The classic Inferno also had a smaller sibling in 1:10 scale call the Kyosho Inferno 10<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rcscrapyard.net/kyosho-inferno-10.htm|title=Kyosho Inferno 10 on RCScrapyard|website=www.rcscrapyard.net}}</ref> which in turn lead to other \"mini\" versions of the Inferno in later years. \n\n <div class=\"left\">\n\n=== Timeline<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.neobuggy.net/2016/03/01/yuichi-kanais-kyosho-buggy-history-from-inferno-to-mp9-tki4/|title=Kyosho Inferno History|website=Neobuggy}}</ref>===\n<div class=\"left\">{{#tag:timeline|ImageSize=width:800 height:auto barincrement:20\nPlotArea = left:120 bottom:20 top:0 right:20\nAlignbars = justify\nDateFormat = mm/dd/yyyy\nPeriod = from:10/01/1991 till:{{#time: m/d/Y }}\nTimeAxis = orientation:horizontal format:yyyy\n#Legend = orientation:vertical position:bottom columns:3\nScaleMajor = increment:3 start:1992\nScaleMinor = increment:1 start:1992\n\nColors =\n id:Inferno  value:blue      legend:Inferno\n id:DX  value:blue    legend:DX\n id:Turbo    value:blue    legend:Turbo\n id:DXII value:blue   legend:DXII\n id:MP5 value:gray(0.8)   legend:MP5\n id:MP5EVO1 value:gray(0.8)   legend:MP5EVO1\n id:MP5EVO2 value:gray(0.8)  legend:MP5EVO2\n id:MP6 value:red  legend:MP6\n id:MP6sport value:red  legend:MP6sport\n id:MP6Int value:red  legend:MP6Int\n id:MP75 value:green  legend:MP75\n id:MP75K1 value:green  legend:MP75K1\n id:MP75K2 value:green  legend:MP75K2\n id:MP75sports value:green  legend:MP75sports\n id:MP75K3 value:green  legend:MP75K3\n id:MP777 value:orange  legend:MP777\n id:MP777SP1 value:orange  legend:MP777SP1\n id:MP777SP2 value:orange  legend:MP777SP2\n id:MP777WC value:orange  legend:MP777WC\n id:MP9 value:gray(0.6)  legend:MP9\n id:MP9TKI2 value:gray(0.6)  legend:MP9TKI2\n id:MP9TKI3 value:gray(0.6)  legend:MP9TKI3\n id:MP9TKI4 value:gray(0.6)  legend:MP9TKI4\n id:MP10 value:purple  legend:MP10\n\nBarData =\n bar:Inferno text:\"Inferno 4WD (MP3)\"\n bar:DX text:\"Inferno DX (MP3)\"\n bar:Turbo  text:\"Turbo Inferno (MP4)\"\n bar:DXII text:\"Inferno DX II (MP3)\"\n bar:MP5 text:\"MP5\"\n bar:MP5EVO1 text:\"MP5 EVO 1\"\n bar:MP5EVO2 text:\"MP5 EVO 2\"\n bar:MP6 text:\"MP6\"\n bar:MP6sport text:\"MP6 Sport\"\n bar:MP6Int text:\"MP6 International\"\n bar:MP75 text:\"MP 7.5\"\n bar:MP75K1 text:\"MP 7.5 Kanai 1\"\n bar:MP75K2 text:\"MP 7.5 Kanai 2\"\n bar:MP75sports text:\"MP 7.5 Sports v1-v4\"\n bar:MP75K3 text:\"MP 7.5 Kanai 3\"\n bar:MP777 text:\"MP 777\"\n bar:MP777SP1 text:\"MP 777 SP1\"\n bar:MP777SP2 text:\"MP 777 SP2\"\n bar:MP777WC text:\"MP 777 SP2 WC\"\n bar:MP9 text:\"MP 9\"\n bar:MP9TKI2 text:\"MP 9 TKI2\"\n bar:MP9TKI3 text:\"MP 9 TKI3\"\n bar:MP9TKI4 text:\"MP 9 TKI4\"\n bar:MP10 text:\"MP 10\"\n\nPlotData=\n width:11\n bar:Inferno from:10/01/1991 till:10/01/1993      color:Inferno\n bar:DX from:01/01/1992 till:04/12/1994 color:DX\n bar:Turbo  from:04/02/1994 till:04/12/1995       color:Turbo\n bar:DXII from:01/01/1995 till:12/12/1996 color:DXII\n bar:MP5 from:01/01/1995 till:01/12/1998 color:MP5\n bar:MP5EVO1 from:01/01/1996 till:01/12/1997 color:MP5EVO1\n bar:MP5EVO2 from:01/01/1997 till:01/12/1998 color:MP5EVO2\n bar:MP6 from:01/01/1998 till:12/12/2001 color:MP6\n bar:MP6sport from:12/01/1999 till:12/12/2002 color:MP6sport\n bar:MP6Int from:12/01/1998 till:12/12/2001 color:MP6Int\n bar:MP75 from:12/01/2000 till:12/12/2004 color:MP75\n bar:MP75k1 from:12/10/2000 till:12/12/2001 color:MP75k1\n bar:MP75k2 from:12/12/2001 till:12/12/2002 color:MP75k2\n bar:MP75sports from:12/12/2001 till:12/12/2009 color:MP75sports\n bar:MP75k3 from:12/12/2002 till:12/12/2004 color:MP75k3\n bar:MP777 from:12/10/2004 till:12/12/2008 color:MP777\n bar:MP777SP1 from:12/10/2004 till:12/12/2005 color:MP777SP1\n bar:MP777SP2 from:12/12/2005 till:12/12/2006 color:MP777SP2\n bar:MP777WC from:12/12/2006 till:12/12/2008 color:MP777WC\n bar:MP9 from:12/10/2008 till:12/12/2010 color:MP9\n bar:MP9TKI2 from:12/10/2010 till:12/12/2012 color:MP9TKI2\n bar:MP9TKI3 from:12/10/2012 till:01/12/2016 color:MP9TKI3\n bar:MP9TKI4 from:01/01/2016 till:12/30/2018 color:MP9TKI4\n bar:MP10 from:01/01/2019 till:end color:MP10}}</div></div>\n\n== Classic Inferno (late 1991\u20131996) ==\n\n=== Models and specifications ===\nAs with its predecessor, Kyosho released an intermediate-level car first which contained several performance parts.  Not long after, this would be followed by a more affordable \"DX\" version and then a high performance \"Turbo\" version.  The cars were typically released in kit form; however, Kyosho chose to release \"DX\" entry-level models partially assembled, making the car more attractive for customers who were completely new to the hobby.  Depending on the country of release, the DX models would also include Kyosho's own GS engine, which was already set up and ready to run. This further reduced the complexity and made an otherwise highly technical hobby more approachable for a larger audience.  \n\nThe success of this approach can be seen in the extent to which budget DX cars, that are available second hand, have been upgraded by their owners over time as they gained skill and confidence in the hobby. The Inferno's popularity also spawned a large number of 3rd party suppliers<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rc10talk.com/viewtopic.php?f=30&t=42144&start=105|title=3rd party optional parts for the classic Kyosho Inferno|website=www.rc10talk.com}}</ref> that provided additional performance accessories such as brake discs, carbon fiber plates etc. Original Kyosho parts for these cars were still mostly given the \"BS\" and \"BSW\" nomenclature from the Burns series of cars and were also partially compatible with them. Later models received part numbers starting with IF and IFW.   \n\nThe versatility of this platform also enabled Kyosho to create 1:8 scale road and rally cars called the \"Super Eight GP LANDMAX 4WD\"<ref name=\":10\" /> and the Inferno ST (Stadium Truck) series. The Landmax were based on the original Inferno chassis until 2001 and the original ST until 2005<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rcscrapyard.net/kyosho-inferno-st.htm|title=Kyosho Inferno ST on RC Scrapyard|website=www.rcscrapyard.net}}</ref>, nearly a decade after the production of the classic Inferno buggy ended.    \n\nAfter winning every world championship during its production run, the classic Inferno was phased out in favor of the MP5 in 1995. \n\n==== Inferno 4WD, item no. 3281 (late 1991 \u2013 late 1993) ====\nAs the successor to the Turbo Burns, the classic Inferno not only had a couple of the same parts, but also had a similar body design and countersunk chassis plate. The similarities were largely superficial however with only the following parts being interchangeable with its predecessor. \n* Differentials (however Burns had 2 bevel gears, classic and Turbo Inferno had 4, see comparison table below)<ref name=\":0\" /> \n* Wing and wing mount \n* Shock absorbers \n* Wishbones, hubs and axles\n* Fuel tank \n* Engine mount \n* Most screws, nuts, washers, etc. \nThe car introduced many new design elements and notable improvements which would largely continue in subsequent Inferno models \n* Single radio tray which held all electrical components and could be switched quickly as one unit when desired. (Burns radio tray did not hold the throttle servo)  \n* Stronger shock mounts with more mounting options \n* Differentials with 4 bevel gears (Burns had 2)<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/148807212@N06/37470601544/in/photostream/#|title=Kyosho Differential Comparison|website=Flickr}}</ref> \n* Two part diff housings for faster maintenance (Burns diff. housing consisted of 5 parts)\n* New wheels and tires \n** Wide at front and back (Burns had narrow wheels and tires at front with the exception of the limited edition Turbo Burns SCC)\n** Micro spike tires instead of regular spikes\n** Lighter wheels with narrower spokes\n* Separate front and rear disc brake (This was an optional part for the Burns towards the end of its production run and was supplied with the limited edition [[Kyosho Burns|Turbo Burns SCC]]. The Inferno brake setup is not compatible with the Burns series.)\n\n==== Inferno DX; item no. 3290h (1992\u20131994) ====\nJust like the [[Kyosho Burns|Burns series]], the \"DX\" referred to the entry-level specification car. Unlike the Burns, however, this DX came partially assembled and some metal parts such as the exhaust and shock absorbers were replaced with plastic parts. An overview of the differences can be seen in the table below. The BS121 ring and pinion gears were made from a cheaper alloy material instead of the steel gears which were found in the Classic and Turbo versions of the car<ref name=\":0\" />.\n\nUnlike the Inferno 4WD und Turbo Inferno, the chassis of the car had additional holes to mount the Kyosho GS21-CR series engine. This particular engine is recognizable by its heat-sink which has vertical instead of the more common horizontal fins<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/gp/148807212@N06/c20xB4|title=Kyosho .21 GS21-RC Head|website=Flickr}}</ref>. An interesting cost saving measure was also the lack of countersunk holes in the chassis which would have required an extra production step. This had not been seen since the original Burns.\n\n==== Turbo Inferno; item no. 31346 (1994\u20131995) ====\nContinuing the model naming of the [[Kyosho Burns|Burns series]], the first series of Inferno cars also used the name \"Turbo\" to signify the car with the largest number of performance parts. Visually the Turbo Inferno could easily be identified by the anodized blue chassis plate and larger capacity, blue shock absorbers. Interestingly Kyosho did not include the blue anodized plates which were mounted in the steering and center differential of the Inferno DXII which was released the following year. The Turbo Inferno also included newly designed green wheels, a green spoiler, and unique \"high grip\" tires (part W5646H) which were supplied from the factory. Other than that the car was very similar in specification to the Inferno 4WD as can be seen in the comparison table below. The new, rigid plastic spoiler was the first departure from the Lexan versions which had been used until that point and would remain standard equipment on all future Inferno models.\n\n==== Inferno DX II Ltd.; item no. 31552 (1995\u20131996) ====\nThe DXII used pieces from the initial classic Inferno 4WD, first Inferno DX and Turbo Burns. Most notable differences from the first DX were: \n* The plastic shock absorbers were replaced with those from the classic Inferno 4WD (same type as Turbo Burns)\n* The metal bearings were replaced with the ball bearings from the classic Inferno 4WD and Turbo Inferno\n* The plastic muffler and rubber manifold were replaced with the Aluminum tuned muffler and manifold from the older Turbo Burns\n* The Lexan wing was replaced with the hard plastic wing of the Turbo Inferno, however in the same yellow of the wheels instead of the Turbo's green. Although the part number of the wing stayed the same (BSW-71KY), Kyosho changed the color to neon yellow after the DXII was discontinued making the original yellow wing one of the hardest parts to find for collectors and restorers.\n\nIn addition the DXII had all blue anodized plates (with the exception of the chassis), and an additional hole in the chassis to accommodate a pull start. Some DXII kits also included the GS21-X engine. This engine had a new, larger head with horizontal fins to compensate for the overheating issues of the previous GS21-CR.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/gp/148807212@N06/wf62v7|title=Kyosho GS-21 X|website=Flickr}}</ref> The new head was available in plain aluminum (part 6520-31) and later with a blue anodized head (part 6520-31bl)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/gp/148807212@N06/L84349|title=Kyosho GS21 X later model heat sink 6520-31|website=Flickr}}</ref> to match the other blue plates on the car.\n\nAs there was no entry-level \"Sports\" version of the subsequent MP5 model the Inferno DXII remained Kyosho's entry-level car until 1996. Kyosho would not release another entry level 1/8 Buggy until the MP6 Sports in 1999. \n\n==== Overview of main differences between classic Inferno models ====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|\u00a0\n|'''Part name'''\n|'''Turbo Inferno'''\n|'''Inferno 4WD'''\n|'''Inferno DX'''\n|'''Inferno DXII Limited'''\n|-\n|'''1'''\n|Differential ring gear\n|BS14*\n|BS14*\n|BS121\n|BS121\n|-\n|'''2'''\n|Differential pinion gear\n|BS14*\n|BS14*\n|BS121\n|BS121\n|-\n|'''3'''\n|Differential bevel gear (S)\n|BS37 (2 pairs per  diff)\n|BS37 (2 pairs per  diff)\n|BS37 (1 pair per diff)\n|BS37 (1 pair per diff)\n|-\n|'''4'''\n|Differential bevel gear (L)\n|BSW64\n|BS36\n|BS36\n|BS36\n|-\n|'''5'''\n|Tires\n|W5646H\n|BSW40\n|BSW40\n|BSW40\n|-\n|'''6'''\n|Chassis\n|BS108**** (blue anodized)\n|BS108\n|BS120\n|GT28\n|-\n|'''7'''\n|Ball bearings\n|Full\n|Full\n|Metal Bushings\n|Full\n|-\n|'''8'''\n|Wheels\n|BSW80KG\n|BS105\n|BS105\n|BS105\n|-\n|'''9'''\n|Wing\n|BSW71KG (Plastic)***\n|BSW5 (Lexan)\n|BSW5 (Lexan)\n|BSW71KY (Plastic)***\n|-\n|'''10'''\n|Shocks\n|BSW72 + BSW73\n|BSW27 + BSW28\n|2001 & 2002  plastic\n|BSW27 + BSW28\n|-\n|'''11'''\n|Front Axels\n|BS20 (Universal)**\n|BS20 (Universal)**\n|BS45 (Dog Bones)\n|BS45 (Dog Bones)\n|-\n|'''12'''\n|Center Diff \n|BSW34 (Adjustable)\n|BSW34 (Adjustable)\n| -\n| -\n|-\n|'''13'''\n|Spur gear\n|BS11\n|BS11\n|BS122\n|BS122\n|-\n|'''14'''\n|Stabilizer\n|BS63 + BSW79\n| -\n| -\n| -\n|-\n|'''15'''\n|Fuel Tank\n|BS65\n|BS65\n|BS28\n|BS65\n|-\n|'''16'''\n|Exhaust\n| -\n| -\n|BS123\n|BS64\n|-\n|'''17'''\n|Manifold\n| -\n| -\n|BS124\n|BS26\n|-\n|'''18'''\n|Engine\n| -\n| -\n|Kyosho GS21CR (optional)\n|Kyosho GS21X\n|-\n|'''19'''\n|Plate Set\n|BS115 + BS116\n|BS115 + BS116\n|BS115 + BS116\n|BS115 + BS116 (both blue anodized)\n|}\n<nowiki>*</nowiki>Depending on the market and year of production the Turbo Infernos and Inferno 4WDs may also have been supplied with BSW-1 and BSW-2 hardened gears from the factory instead of the standard BS-14 set.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.rc10talk.com/viewtopic.php?f=30&t=42144&start=45&sid=ac245d6201ce746288d802c59dd88a5a|title=BSW-1 and BSW-2 gear discussion on RC10Talk|website=RC10Talk}}</ref>\n\n<nowiki>**</nowiki> Kyosho changed the part numbering of BS20 universal joint to IFW62 in the later references.\n\n<nowiki>***</nowiki> Kyosho eventually changed the part numbering of the BSW71 wing to  IFW213.

The later MP5 and MP6 had similar parts which however were <u>not</u> compatible with the classic Inferno. \n\nThe BSW-55 special diff housing and BSW-82 One Way Diff are among the most rare and expensive parts on the second-hand market<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/gp/148807212@N06/3Y9921|title=BSW-55, BSW-82 and BSW-19 on Flickr|website=Flickr}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/148807212@N06/38181097951/in/photostream/|title=BSW-55 & BSW-82 disassembled on Flickr|website=Flickr}}</ref>.\n\nOne of the more common, and frequently discussed optional parts are the hardened BSW-1 and BSW-2 differential gears<ref name=\":4\" />. It is also the only series of infernos that had 3 different specifications of differentials (depending on the country of sale). As can be seen in the table above the budget Inferno DX models used a cheaper alloy gear set (BS-121), while the mid-range Inferno 4WD cars came with the BS-14 from the Burns generation, and the Turbo Inferno was supplied with the BS-14 or the optional BSW-1 and BSW-2 set depending on the country of sale.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n=== Box art and marketing material ===\nThe Inferno series continued the same style of box art and marketing material of its predecessor using mostly studio pictures of assembled and painted models. The only exception was the Turbo Inferno which came in a plane white and green box with a drawn outline of the car on the front<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.retromodelisme.com/voiture/255-1/turbo-inferno-kit-kyosho.html|title=Turbo Inferno Unboxing|website=www.retromodelisme.com}}</ref>. The Inferno and Inferno DX/DXII came with a box which had an integrated handle.\n\n=== Collectibillity and current popularity (1996\u2013) ===\nAs with the [[Kyosho Burns|Burns]], the most collectible of this initial line-up is the Turbo version. This is in part due to its rarity, especially in good condition. Collectors specifically look for cars on which the blue anodized chassis has no damage, as well as unused tires The blue anodized verion of the chassis with part number BS108 was not available as spare part which makes it particularly dificult to find new.<ref name=\":11\" />  The demand and value on the second hand market is however significantly lower than the Turbo Burns which preceded it, with near mint condition cars with box often selling for less than 200 US Dollars. Collectors are also interested in the first DX in its original configuration as these were typically upgraded by their owners over time. Their original [[Kyosho]] engine, plastic shock absorbers and exhaust being discarded for higher performance parts \n\nDue to the low re-sale value and an abundance of spare parts, as well as reproduction parts such as new bodies and decals<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.marwanrc.com/main.sc;jsessionid=4EC1D4EC52D4AE3E818C846D4BFFD2A6.p3plqscsfapp003|title=Marwan RC|website=MarwanRC}}</ref>, the Inferno 4WD and Turbo Inferno are a good choice for entry and intermediate level RC buggy enthusiasts.

The few remaining parts which are still compatible with the previous Burns cars (MP1-MP2) include the 19mm hex wheels (which would later be changed to 17mm on the Inferno 7.5 as a new industry standard), and the fuel tank. A few other parts such as the wing design, shock absorbers and brake discs were carried across from the Turbo Inferno.\n\nThe MP5/MP6 also included some new design features which remain with the current Inferno line up. \n* Upward angle (kick-up) at the front of chassis<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tamiyaclub.com/showroom_model.asp?cid=121580&id=5484|title=Kyosho MP5 Unboxing|website=Tamiya Club}}</ref>\n* Splash resistant box for receiver and other electronics (instead of being mounted on the radio tray with the servos)\n\nLike its predecessors, the MP3 and MP4 Infernos, the MP5 & MP6 won every [[International Federation of Model Auto Racing|IFMAR]] title during their production run, first in its standard form and later with the EVO editions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.neobuggy.net/2012/11/27/the-world-champions-cars-2010-1986/|title=RC 1:8 Buggy World Championship Winners 1986-2010|website=Neobuggy.net}}</ref> The MP5 and MP6 are visually nearly identical using the same body and wheels, however the MP6 had a longer chassis and wider rear track.

Unlike its predecessors, however, no entry level MP5 was produced. \n\nThe MP5 won the world championship in 1996<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rcscrapyard.net/kyosho-Inferno-mp5.htm|title=MP5 on RCScrapyard|website=RC Scrapyard}}</ref>, and was marketed as a competition buggy with many in-house options being made available within its first year of production. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rcmagvintage.com/reviews/retro/voitures/tt/musee/kyosho/catalogues/minicataloguemp5/minicataloguemp5.htm|title=MP5 Options Catalog|website=RCMagvintage}}</ref> \n\n==== MP5 With Picco P6B, item no. 31663P (1996) ====\nA standard Inferno MP5 model packed from the factory with a Picco P6B engine, also includes a manifold and muffler.

It was released in 1996 and included a few parts from the options catalog<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tamiyaclub.com/showroom_model.asp?cid=123736&sid=5484|title=MP5 EVO 1 Unboxing and Additional Instruction Manual|website=Tamiya Club}}</ref>. Unlike the standard MP5 which was supplied with the white wheels and wing that were featured on the box art, the EVO1 was supplied with a set of green wheels and a green wing. The car was sold for one year before being replaced by the EVO2.\n\n==== MP5 EVO2, item no. 31781 (1997\u20131998) ====\nThe EVO2 was based closely on the car which won the 1996 World Championship<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.tamiyaclub.com/showroom_model.asp?cid=114210|title=Kyosho MP5 EVO2 Unboxing|website=Tamiya Club}}</ref> Among various options the most noticeable difference to the previous MP5 models was the longer chassis and rear wishbones which were later used for the MP6.

In addition to the shock towers, all other Aluminum plates on the MP6 models were also anodized in blue. The unique feature of this \"standard\" MP6 is the gold anodized chassis plate which is highly sought after in good condition.\n\nA special edition was later released featuring the large capacity shocks of the MP6 International<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/gp/148807212@N06/71p5ti|title=MP6 Standard special large shock edition|website=Flickr}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/gp/148807212@N06/92W457|title=MP6 Standard, special large shock edition|website=Flickr}}</ref>.\n\n==== MP6 Sport, item no. 31951 (1999\u20132002) ====\nFormerly referred to as the \"DX\" for the Burns and classic Inferno series of cars, the \"Sport\" was the entry-level car for the MP6 range. It had similar specification changes as the Inferno DXII and was also supplied with a Kyosho GS21 engine with a blue head to match the blue theme of the car (part 6520-31bl).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.oocities.org/clubtt/buggys.html|title=MP6 Overview|website=Geocities}}</ref> Kyosho supplied the sport with a 3&nbsp;mm chassis instead of the 2.5&nbsp;mm of the standard MP6<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.offroad-cult.org/Tracktest/Inferno%20MP6%20SPORTS/Kyosho%20MP6%20Sports.htm|title=MP6 Sports review|website=Offroad Cult}}</ref>. This may lead one to believe that this was a stronger version to outlive the driving of a novice driver; however, the 2.5&nbsp;mm was actually made from a harder alloy. As with the \"DX\" cars, it was possible to upgrade this car to a standard or international version but at a significantly greater cost than if one had bought the international kit directly.\n\n==== MP6 International, item no. 31892 (1998\u20132002) ====\nThe term MP6 \"International\" was used instead of the \"EVO\" nomenclature used to describe performance versions of the MP5 series. The word \"International\" would not be used in this context again but would reappear from the MP9 TKI2 to TKI4, with the \"TKI\" standing for \"Team Kyosho International\". Unlike the MP5 EVO which only had a selection of optional parts, the MP6 featured almost every available option.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tamiyaclub.com/showroom_model.asp?cid=48595|title=Kyosho MP6 International Unboxing|website=Tamiya Club}}</ref> As most of these options were already available for the MP5, the MP6 International could be released only one year after sales for the standard MP6 started.\n\n==== Overview of main differences between MP5 & MP6 models ====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|\u00a0\n|'''Part name'''\n|'''MP5'''\n|'''MP5 EVO1'''\n|'''MP5 EVO2'''\n|'''MP6'''\n|'''MP6 Sport'''\n|'''MP6 International'''\n|-\n|1\n|Ball  bearings\n|Full\n|Full\n|Full\n|Full\n|Full\n|Full\n|-\n|2\n|Brakes\n|IF-28\n|IF-28\n|IF-28\n|IFW-53\n|IF-28\n|IFW-53 but with double disc\n|-\n|3\n|Center  Shaft front\n|IF-33 (dogbone)\n|IF-33 (dogbone)\n|IFW-12 (universal)\n|IF-33 (dogbone)\n|IF-33 (dogbone)\n|IFW-12 (universal)\n|-\n|4\n|Center  Shaft rear\n| IF-33 (dogbone)\n| IF-33 (dogbone)\n| IFW-45 (universal)\n| IF-33 (dogbone)\n| IF-33 (dogbone)\n|IFW-45 (universal)\n|-\n|5\n|Chassis\n|IF-4 (2,5mm)\n|IF-4 (2,5mm)\n|IFW-41 (3mm counter sunk)\n|IF-44 (2,5mm, Gold)\n|(3mm not counter sunk)\n|IFW-41 (3mm counter sunk)\n|-\n|6\n|Differential  pinion gear\n|IF-21\n|IF-21\n|IF-21\n|IF-21\n|IF-61\n|IF-21\n|-\n|7\n|Differential  ring gear\n|IF-20\n|IF-20\n|IF-20\n|IF-20\n|IF-61\n|IF-20\n|-\n|8\n|Engine\n| -\n| -\n| -\n| -\n|Kyosho GS21R\n| -\n|-\n|9\n|Manifold & Exhaust\n| -\n| -\n| -\n| -\n|BS-124 & GT-47\n| -\n|-\n|10\n|Front  Axels\n|BS-20 (universal)*\n|BS-20 (universal)*\n|BS-20 (universal)*\n|BS-20 (universal)*\n|dogbone\n|BS-20 (universal)*\n|-\n|11\n|Front  Shock Stay\n|IF-3\n|IF-3\n|IFW-20\n|IF-47\n|IF-47\n|IFW-20\n|-\n|12\n|Front  torque rod\n| -\n| -\n|IFW-06\n| -\n|IFW-43\n|IFW-43\n|-\n|13\n|Main  Gear 46T\n|IF-22 (plastic)\n|IF-22 (plastic)\n|IFW-03 (steel)\n|IF-22 (plastic)\n|IF-22 (plastic)\n|IFW-03 (steel)\n|-\n|14\n|Manifold\n| -\n| -\n| -\n| -\n|BS124\n| -\n|-\n|15\n|Rear  Axels\n|BS-45 (dogbone)\n|BS-45 (dogbone)\n|IFW-42 (universal)\n|BS-45 (dogbone)\n|BS-45 (dogbone)\n|IFW-42 (universal)\n|-\n|16\n|Servo  Saver\n|IF-18\n|IF-18\n|IFW-04 (ball bearing)\n|IF-18\n|IF-18\n|IFW-04 (ball bearing)\n|-\n|17\n|Shocks\n| BSW72 + BSW73\n| BSW72 + BSW73\n|IFW30 + IFW31\n| BSW72 + BSW73\n|BSW72 + BSW73\n|IFW30 + IFW31\n|-\n|18\n|Springs\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|IFW-33W\n|-\n|19\n|Stabilizer  Front\n| -\n| -\n| -\n| -\n| -\n|IFW-05\n|-\n|20\n|Stabilizer  Rear\n|IF-32\n|IF-32\n|IF-32\n|IF-32\n|IF-32\n|IFW-21 (thicker)\n|-\n|21\n|Steering  Plate\n|IF-19\n|IF-19\n|IFW-14 (blue)\n|IF-19\n|IFW-14 (blue)\n|IFW-14 (blue)\n|-\n|22\n|Steering  Rod Set\n| IF-19\n| IF-19\n| IFW-02 (adjustable)\n| IF-19\n|IF-19\n| IFW-02 (adjustable)\n|-\n|23\n|Wheel  stopper\n| \n| \n| \n| \n|IFW-44 (wide)\n| \n|-\n|24\n|Wheels\n|BSW80W\n|BSW80KG\n|None\n|BSW80W\n|BSW80BL\n|None\n|-\n|25\n|Wing\n| BSW71W\n| BSW71KG\n| None\n| BSW71W\n|BSW71BL\n| None\n|-\n|26\n|Wing  Collar Stay\n|IF-25\n|IF-25\n|IFW-07 (blue)\n|IF-25\n|IF-25\n|IFW-07 (blue)\n|}\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> Kyosho changed the part numbering of BS20 universal swing to IFW62 in the later references.\n\n=== Notable optional parts ===\nMost of the in-house optional parts were available on the MP6 international and were relatively common compared to the Burns and Classic Inferno options due to the volume of cars that Kyosho was producing and selling by this point. As with the Classic Inferno, the rarest part is the special aluminum center diff, which in this case had part number IFW-8.  It was essentially very similar to the plastic parts they replaced and much less complex that the BSW-55 aluminum differential of the classic Inferno. As it was not provided with the MP6 International, unlike almost all other optional parts, one could assume that Kyosho did not consider it a cost-effective or desirable item.\n\n=== Box art and marketing material ===\nUnlike previous models, the cars on the front of the box of the MP5 and MP6 series were shown with bodies that were unpainted, clearly showing the internals of the car. Only a part of the front of the car had a semi transparent indication of the official paint scheme which could be found on the cars depicted on other parts of the box and in the marketing material.\n\nAlso, unlike the previous inferno models, the box art was largely the same regardless of the version of the car. The main box art showed the initial version of the car (standard MP5 or MP6), with different iterations being indicated by a label at the bottom right corner of the box. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tamiyaclub.com/showroom_model.asp?cid=123736|title=Kyosho MP5 Evo Box|website=www.tamiyaclub.com}}</ref>  \n\nAn exception to this was the MP6 sport which had a clearly distinguishable box-art, and a car with a painted body.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tamiyaclub.com/showroom_model.asp?cid=132478&id=5484|title=Kyosho MP6 Box|website=www.tamiyaclub.com}}</ref> \n\nTo an extent, Kyosho used different colored wheels and wings to highlight the versions of the car on the main box-art however the color coding of these parts was sometimes not the same between the pictures seen in on the box and catalogs, and those which were available in the box. \n\n {| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Car\n!Main Box-Art\n!Main Catalog\n!Sold in Box\n|-\n|MP5\n|White\n|White\n|White\n|-\n|MP5 Evo1\n|White\n|White\n|Green\n|-\n|MP5 Evo2\n|White\n|White\n|None\n|-\n|MP6\n|Orange\n|White\n|None\n|-\n|MP6 Sport\n|Blue\n|Blue\n|Blue\n|-\n|MP6 Int.\n|Orange\n|Green (studio photo) & Orange (track photo)\n|None\n|}\n\n=== Collectibillity and current popularity (2002\u2013) ===\nAt the time of writing in 2018, the MP5 & MP6 are slowly attaining \"classic\" car status<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.classic.rc-junkies.net/?page_id=204|title=What makes a classic?|website=Classic RC Junkies}}</ref> and are not yet particularly sought after on the second hand market. Because of this, good condition MP5 Evo2's or MP6 Internationals are still affordable and parts cars are readily available. This can enable starting hobbyist to have what was once world championship winning technology for a relatively low price. Optional parts are also more readily available and cheaper than those for its Burns and Inferno predecessors.\n\nThe MP6 Sports did not have a good reputation due to its relatively high price and low performance<ref name=\":3\" /> and is typically only sought after by enthusiasts looking to complete a collection. As with the Inferno DX prices for these in good, original condition are relatively high as owners typically discarded the original, low cost parts.   \n\n== Inferno MP7.5  (2000\u20132004, 2009 for \"Sports\" models) ==\n\n===  Models and specifications ===\nAfter nearly 5 years of evolution rather than revolution with the MP5 and MP6 series of cars, Kyosho released the MP 7.5 which was redesigned from the ground up. The \".5\" allegedly stands for the 5 consecutive IFMAR World Championships which had been won by the Inferno series at the time of its release.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vintage-rc.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=141&t=20914&start=30|title=Kyosho Timeline Discussion|website=Vintage-RC}}</ref> \n\n==== MP7.5, item no. 31081 (2000\u20132004) ====\nAs with the other Infernos before it, this first release would provide a good intermediate level car, which could be upgraded to competition specifications relatively quickly. As with the later Kanai competition versions, the selection of the radio gear, motor and muffler were left to the buyer and were not included in the kit.  \n\n==== MP7.5 Sports v1, item no. 31192 (2001\u20132005), v2 item no. 31276 (2005\u20132009), v3 item no. 31278 (2009), v4 item no. 31279 (2009) ====\nFollowing the tradition of previous generations of the Inferno series, the entry level \"Sports\" variant was released a year after the initial mid-range car.

It was setup to be easy to drive, with a wide power band and with a price tag of under 400 US Dollars it was aimed at casual and novice drivers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rcmart.com/kyosho-31275-inferno-mp75-sports-bluewhite-p-13165.html|title=RC Mart MP7.5 Sports|website=RC Mart}}</ref> In line with previous DX and Sports version there are a significant number of differences in the type and quality of parts between this entry level car, and the intermediate and competition variants. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showthread.php?130955-Differences-between-Inferno-MP7-5-and-Sports-version|title=RC Groups, differences between MP7.5 Standard and MP7.5 Sports.|website=RCGroups.com}}</ref> During its production cycle there were 4 different releases of the MP7.5 Sports which had slightly different specifications and different color body shells, wheels and wings.\n\nAs there was no entry level model for the MP777 which succeeded the MP7.5 in 2005, Kyosho continued manufacturing the Sports versions of the MP 7.5 until 2009 at which point the MP777 was also discontinued.\n\n==== MP7.5 Kanai 1, item no. 31191 (2000\u20132001) ====\nThis was the first ever car in the Kyosho line up to bare the name of its designer and factory race driver Yuichi Kanai. Yuichi Kanai developed all of the Kyosho 1/8 off-road buggies from the Kyosho Turbo Burns onward <ref name=\":1\" /> and was actively competing with the MP7.5 at the time. His name was used for the editions of the car that were released with a selection of the modifications he developed during the race seasons. Quad center disc brakes, special chassis and arms and a special rear wing were a few of the modifications. The Kanai editions were aimed to be competition ready cars for experienced, competitive drivers.\n\n==== MP7.5 Kanai 2, item no. 31271 (2001\u20132002) ====\nThe Kanai 2 was an evolution of the Kanai 1 and focused on improved strength and steering geometry, and had double disk brakes<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rcuniverse.com/forum/rc-1-8th-scale-buggies/2370135-whats-kyosho-difference-print.html|title=MP7.5 Differences|website=www.RCUniverse.com}}</ref>. \n\n==== MP7.5 Kanai 3, item no. 31273 (2002\u20132004) ====\nThis was the final version of the MP7.5 which incorporated the lessons learned from the preceding IFMAR championships and other races in which the MP7.5 competed. This car relied less on completely re-designed parts but instead on slight modifications to existing parts to improve the setup and reliability of the car. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rcmart.com/kyosho-31273-inferno-mp75-yuichi-kanai-p-6078.html|title=RC Mart MP7.5 Kanai 3|website=RC Mart}}</ref> As with other performance variants, this model did not include items such as radio equipment, engine and mufflers as the ideal selection of these were highly dependent on both the track and the driver. In its original condition, the Kanai 3 can be recognized through its milled out chassis and titanium screws. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rctech.net/forum/nitro-off-road/813208-kyosho-mp7-5-kanai.html|title=RCTech MP7.5 Kanai|website=RC Tech}}</ref>\n\n=== Collectibillity and current popularity (2008\u2013) ===\nThe MP7.5 has many years to go before it becomes a classic. Due to the volumes that Kyosho produced it and the fact that there were no special, limited editions of the car, they are also of limited interest to collectors. They do however provide an excellent platform for brushless electric conversion with Kyosho<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite web|url=http://rc.kyosho.com/en/ifw451.html|title=Kyosho Inferno Brushless Conversion Kit|website=www.kyosho.com}}</ref> and many 3rd party suppliers providing conversion kits. They are one of the most common and most economical secondhand Kyosho 1/8 scale cars available on the second hand market. This makes the 7.5 an excellent car for beginners who are looking for relatively modern technology with an abundance of replacement and performance parts with the option to convert to brushless if desired.\n\n== Inferno MP777  (2004\u20132008) ==\n\n=== Models and specifications ===\nThe MP777 was released in 2004 to celebrate 6 successive wins at the IFMAR world championships.<ref name=\":1\" /> The fact that this car was more of an evolution than a revolution compared to its predecessor is reflected through the retention of the number 7 as the first character of the model number. The main focus of the MP777 was increased durability, better fine tuning options, and improved handling characteristics by moving the center of gravity.  \n\n==== MP777, item no. 31777 (2004\u20132008) ====\nAmong the main changes to the layout and construction of the MP777 there was a newly positioned center of gravity, as well as longer stroke for the rear suspension and more suspension pin angles.  The durability was improved through additional components such as a muffler guard to prevent damage from lateral hits, guarded front hubs, and a newly designed \"dish type\" wheel to prevent dirt from getting in the axels on muddy tracks. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.winrctech.com.hk/product_sub2_sub1.php?id=35&sid=7&bid=1&cc=1|title=MP777 Specs|website=www.winrctech.com.hk}}</ref> Although these changes do not seem significant they provided the foundation to win the IFMAR championship title that followed in Indonesia in 2006.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rccaraction.com/2012-ifmar-18-scale-off-road-world-championships-are-almost-here/|title=List of IFMAR Winners 1986 to 2010|website=www.rccaraction.com}}</ref>\n\n==== MP777 SP 1, item no. 31778 (2004\u20132005) ====\nThe SP1 had a number of upgrades including a \"traction control\" front differential, a machined Duralumin engine mount, various blue anodized alloy parts and also had a set of dampers which had a special coating on the inside to reduce friction. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://rc.kyosho.com/en/31779.html|title=MP777 SP1 on Kyosho website|website=www.kyosho.com}}</ref>  \n\n==== MP777 SP 2, item no. 31779 & 31779S21 (2005\u20132006) ====\nThe SP2 had a couple of differences which were not apparent in the marketing material as this used the same car as the SP1.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://rc.kyosho.com/en/31779.html|title=MP777 SP2 on Kyosho website|website=www.kyosho.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.kyosho.com/jpn/fun/magazine/pdf/rcw0510_1.pdf|title=Kyosho sales brochure|website=www.kyosho.com}}</ref> These included a wheelbase which had been lengthened by 4mm while the engine and R/C system had been moved 1.5mm to the rear to improve the stability and steering characteristics. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.winrctech.com.hk/product_sub2_sub1.php?id=36&sid=7&bid=1&cc=1|title=MP777 SP2 Specs|website=www.winrctech.com.hk}}</ref>  \n\nThere was also a special edition with item number 31779S21 which included a Sirio S21BK EVO-2 engine, exhaust and manifold. \n==== MP777 WC, item no. 31780 & 31780S21 (2006\u20132008) ====\nThe MP777 WC Team Edition Kit came with a S21BK EVO-2 STI Motor. The car was a replica of the one which won the 7th IFMAR world championship.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://rc.kyosho.com/en/31780s21.html|title=Kyosho MP777 WC 31780S21|website=www.kyosho.com}}</ref>   \n\n=== Collectibillity and current popularity (2008\u2013) ===\nThe MP777 has many years to go before it becomes a classic, and because of the large number that were produced they are not very rare (with the exception of the \"s21\" model numbers with the Sirio engine). Therefore, most are of limited interest to collectors. They do, however, provide an excellent platform for brushless electric conversions with Kyosho,<ref name=\":6\" /> and many third-party suppliers provide conversion kits.\n\n== Inferno MP9  (2008\u20132018) ==\n\n=== Models and specifications ===\nSimilar to Microsoft skipping Windows 9, or Apple the iPhone 9, the omission of an Kyosho MP8 model indicated a revolution between the new MP9 and the previous MP7X models. Despite being redesigned from the ground up, the process apparently only took 6 months.<ref name=\":1\" /> A true indication of this revolution is the fact that the MP9 also embraced the new brushless electric motor technology from the factory in addition to the traditional two stroke engine.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://rc.kyosho.com/en/30898.html|title=MP9e TKI4 on Kyosho Website|website=www.kyosho.com}}</ref> It shares almost no parts with the previous MP7X generation and from the second car onward the abbreviation \"TKI\" which stands for \"Team Kyosho International\" was added to the model name which had not been used before. \n\nThe MP9 has been less successful over its lifetime that the other Inferno models with only one win in 2010 by US driver Cody King <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.femca-rc.com/?attachment_id=2583|title=IFMAR Winners 1986-2018|website=www.femca-rc.com}}</ref>, however there is also now considerably more competition as the cost of engineering and production of the vehicles has decreased over time. Nevertheless, it has won many other competitions and also earned a respectable second place at the IFMAR in 2016. <ref name=\":8\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.amazon.de/Kyosho-Inferno-TKI4-Buggy-Upgrade/dp/B01F3XLZ70|title=Kyosho TKI3 to TKI4 upgrade kit|website=www.amazon.com}}</ref>  \n\n==== MP9, item no. 31782 & 31783 (2008\u20132010) ====\nAlthough the internals of the car were new from the ground up <ref name=\":1\" />, the body still harked back to the long swooping lines and curves of previous Inferno models. This would start to change from the TKI2 model onward. Different from the MP6 and MP7.5 generations, the budget conscious version of the MP9 no longer used the \"Sports\" branding. Instead it was simply known as number 31783. As with previous entry level cars, the focus lay on keeping the overall characteristics and functionality of the car the same, with the main cost savings being in the materials and level of finish applied to the individual components.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://rc.kyosho.com/en/31783.html|title=MP9 71783 Entry Level model|website=www.kyosho.com}}</ref>  There were no \"ready-set\" pre-assembled cars in this first release.  \n\n==== MP9TKI2, item no. 31784, 31785, 31785CK, 31785JT, 31786 & 31787 (2010\u20132012) ====\nWith the ever increasing speed of the cars, aerodynamics of the body started to play a more important role. This was also noticeable in the marketing material for later models. <ref name=\":7\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.amainhobbies.com/kyosho-inferno-mp9-tki4-10th-anniversary-special-edition-1-8-nitro-buggy-kit-kyo33011b/p733364|title=MP9 TKI4 10 anniversary edition at Amainhobbies|website=www.ammainhobbies.com}}</ref> The \"cabin\" section of the body became more steeply racked and the back of the body was tapered upwards towards the spoiler. These changes started a shift away from the traditional drawn out, rounded lines that started with the [[Kyosho Burns|Turbo Burns]] back in the late 1980s. The TKI2 started with a semi-assembled 31784 <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://rc.kyosho.com/en/discontinued/dis-rccar/gpoffroad/31784.html|title=MP9 item no.31784 semi assembled on kyosho website|website=www.kyosho.com}}</ref> and a regular un-assembled 31785 kit. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://rc.kyosho.com/en/31785.html|title=MP9 TKI2 31785|website=www.kyosho.com}}</ref>\n\nAnother first was the launch of limited edition models named after Kyosho team drivers Cody King<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://rc.kyosho.com/en/discontinued/dis-rccar/gpoffroad/31785ck.html|title=MP9 TKI2CR Cody King Special|website=www.kyosho.com}}</ref> who won the IFMAR championship in 2010, and [[Jared Tebo]] who was the top qualifier.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://rc.kyosho.com/en/discontinued/dis-rccar/gpoffroad/31785jt.html|title=MP9 TKI2JT Jared Tebo special edition|website=www.kyosho.com}}</ref> They had set numbers 31785CK and 31785JT respectively. The cars were released to celebrate the 8th IFMAR victory and featured the same engine as the championship winning car. Depending on the model, either King's or Tebo's signatures were engraved on the mufflers. As with the MP777 there was also a general World Championship \"WC\" car released which was not driver specific. It had item number 31786 <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://rc.kyosho.com/en/discontinued/dis-rccar/gpoffroad/31786.html|title=MP9 TKI2 31786 Semi Assembled|website=www.kyosho.com}}</ref>  followed by a semi-assembled \"Spec A\" version of the same car with item number 31787<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://rc.kyosho.com/en/31787.html|title=MP9 TKI2 WC Limited Edition Spec-A|website=www.kyosho.com}}</ref>. This was the final release for the TKI2 range of cars.     \n\n==== MP9TKI3, item no. 31788 & 31888 & 31889T1  (2012\u20132016) ====\nThe TKI3 was a relatively minor evolution of the TKI2 focusing on strengthening certain components and re-positioning of some parts to further optimize the handling. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://rc.kyosho.com/en/31788.html|title=MP9 TKI3|website=www.kyosho.com}}</ref> The big change in the TKI3 line-up was the introduction of a ready-set car which was completely pre-assembled and featured metal parts that were stamped rather than machined to further reduce the cost.<ref name=\":9\">{{Cite web|url=http://rc.kyosho.com/en/31889t1.html|title=MP9 TKI3 Ready Set|website=www.kyosho.com}}</ref> There were two model numbers, 31888 and 31889T1 which both had KE21R engines. Based on Kyosho's archive, the 31889T1 was roughly 25% cheaper than a regular, un-assembled version (approx. 60,000 vs. 80,000 Yen), yet included an engine and all necessary electronics.<ref name=\":9\" /> The car appeared to be less of a compromise compared to previous \"Sports\" iterations and offered a more competitive car for entry level enthusiast. Continuing the public's interest in \"ready-set\" cars, the MP9TKI3 was also released as a palm sized Mini-Z version which could be driven indoors and had item number 32081BB. This was the first indication of a true commercialization for the Kyosho Inferno brand.\n\n==== MP9TKI4, item no. 33001, 33007, 30898 & KYO33011B (2016\u20132018) ====\nIn 2016 the TKI4 earned a respectable second place at the IFMAR championships however the changes between the TKI3 and TKI4 were probably among the smallest between Kyosho releases. This can be seen from the parts available in the TKI3 upgrade pack provided by Kyosho.<ref name=\":8\" /> This car was also available as a partially assembled \"Spec-A\" variant with number 33007. The innovation which might have been missing between the TKI3 and TKI4 was definitely compensated for by the MP9e brushless Kit with number 30898. This was the first electric 1:8 off-road buggy that Kyosho had released from the factory and showed the company embracing an entirely different type of technology which not only brings drastic changes to the way a car handles and performs but also requires entirely new parts and a different layout to maintain similar handling characteristics.\n\nIn 2018 an important milestone was reached as the TKI4 welcomed the 10th anniversary of the MP9 series of cars (number KYO33011B). 10 years is the longest production run of any of the 1/8 Kyosho off-road models. This edition also includes many optional parts in the standard kit and is the highest-spec. TKI4.<ref name=\":7\" /> Even more impressive is that in 2018 one also celebrated 30 years since the release of the [[Kyosho Burns|MP1 Burns series]] which essentially set the foundation for all the 1:8 Kyosho Buggys that followed.\n\n== Inferno MP10  (2019\u2013) ==\n\n=== Models and specifications ===\n==== MP10, item no. 33015 (2019\u2013) ====\nIn January 2019 Kyosho released the new MP10  marking an end to the 10-year production cycle of the MP9. The new car was redesigned from the ground up and Kyosho goes to great lengths to show this by illustrating the main changes to the MP9 in detail on the MP10's webpage. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://rc.kyosho.com/en/inferno-mp10/|title=Inferno MP10 on Kyosho main page|website=www.kyosho.com}}</ref> \n\n== External references and citations ==\n=== External references ===\n* [http://www.rcmagvintage.com/viewforum.php?f=105 Vintage Kyosho Thread at rcmagvintage.com]\n* [http://www.retromodelisme.com/home.html Kyosho Thread on Retromodelisme]\n* [https://www.tamiyaclub.com/forum/index.php?/forum/20-kyosho/ Kyosho Thread on Tamiyaclub.com] \n* [http://www.rcuniverse.com/forum/rc-classic-cars-trucks-513/9089874-vintage-kyosho-buggy-truck-pics-post-them.html Vintage Kyosho Buggy Thread on RCUniverse.com] \n* [http://www.rc-forum.de/forumdisplay.php?693-Kyosho-Offroad Kyosho Thread on RC-Forum.de]\n\n=== Works cited ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n\n\n[[Category:Model cars]]\n[[Category:Kyosho]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Japanese radio controlled car}}\n<!-- EDIT BELOW THIS LINE -->\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Kyosho ''Inferno''}}\n{{Infobox racing car|Car_name=Kyosho Inferno|Image=|Caption=Kyosho Inferno|Category=[[1:8 radio-controlled off-road buggy|1:8 4WD off-road buggy]]|Constructor=[[Kyosho]]|Designer=|Predecessor=Kyosho Burns Series|Successor=|Team=|Drivers=|Technical ref=<!-- <ref name=tech>Insert formatted reference</ref> -->|Chassis=Aluminum|Front suspension=Independent wishbone|Rear suspension=Independent wishbone|Length=<!-- Use: {{convert|XXX|in|cm|1|abbr=on}} -->|Width=<!-- Use: {{convert|XXX|in|cm|1|abbr=on}} -->|Height=|Wheelbase=<!-- Use: {{convert|XXX|in|cm|1|abbr=on}} -->|Track=<!-- Use: {{convert|XXX|in|cm|1|abbr=on}} -->|Gearbox name=|Gears=Shaft driven four-wheel-drive|Type=|Differential=3x 3-gear differentials|Steering=|Weight=<!-- Use: {{convert|XXX|kg|lb|1|abbr=on}} -->|Fuel=Nitro|Lubricants=|Brakes=Double center disc brakes (for front and rear)|Tyres=Rubber pin spike off-road tires with foam inserts|Debut=1991|First_win=|Last_win=|Last_event=|Entries=|Races=|Wins=|Podiums=|Poles=|Fastest_laps=|Titles=|Cons_champ=|Drivers_champ=|Teams_champ=|Engine=Two-stroke .21 \"Nitro\" (3.5cc)|Engine position=Mid mounted}}\nDesigned by Yuichi Kanai<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.rccaraction.com/interview-kyoshos-yuichi-kanai-father-of-the-inferno/|title=Kyosho's Yuichi Kanai Father of the Inferno|website=RC Car Action}}</ref> the '''[[Kyosho]] Inferno''' is a  1/8 scale, four-wheel-drive, off-road competition buggy which was first released in late 1991 as the successor to the [[Kyosho Burns|Kyosho Turbo Burns]]<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.kyosho.com/eng/company/rccar_history02.html|title=Kyosho RC Car History|website=Kyosho Company Website}}</ref>.  As with the Burns series that came before it, each model has several versions with different factory specifications to suit specific budgets and skill levels. The first generation (MP3/MP4), now referred to as the \"classic Inferno\", was produced from late 1991 to the end of 1996 and won every [[International Federation of Model Auto Racing|IFMAR world championship]] during its production run. With 8 [[International Federation of Model Auto Racing|IFMAR]] titles under its belt, the Kyosho Inferno has been the most successful RC car in its scale and deserves the \"fire\" themed brand name which has been in use since the release of the [[Kyosho Burns]] in 1988. <ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== General history ==\n\n=== Background ===\nThe first generation of Infernos were produced from late 1991 to 1996 and shared only a few parts with its predecessor the [[Kyosho Burns|Kyosho Turbo Burns]]. The Inferno was almost a complete redesign based on experiences in competition to increase performance, durability and ease of maintenance.  Any similarity with the Burns series of cars was lost with the introduction of the Inferno MP5 in 1995 which introduced design <u>characteristics</u> which can still be found in the current MP10 more than 20 years later.   \n\nWith the introduction of the Inferno, [[Kyosho]] also chose to sell partially assembled, entry-level kits and introduced their own line of budget GS engines.\n\nAs with the Burns predecessor, it was possible to start with the most affordable car and upgrade to a full option, competition-ready vehicle when the skill and budget allowed. Alternatively one could also buy a competition car for far less than the cost of the individual optional parts.\n\nIt is often not known that the MP (Model Project) nomenclature, which is synonymous with Kyosho buggies from the MP5 onward, was already in use at [[Kyosho]] for the [[Kyosho Burns|Burns series]] and first Inferno series of cars. Burns MP1, Turbo Burns MP2, Inferno MP3, Turbo Inferno MP4.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe versatility of this platform also enabled Kyosho to create 1:8 scale road and rally cars called the \"Super Eight GP LANDMAX 4WD\"<ref name=\":10\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.classic.rc-junkies.net/?p=549|title=Kyosho Landmax history|website=www.classic.rc-junkies.net}}</ref> and the Inferno ST (Stadium Truck) series. The Landmax were based on the original Inferno chassis until 2001, and then the Inferno MP7.5 chassis until 2008. The ST series is still going strong today although the components used bare little resemblance to the current Inferno buggy.

Not long after, this would be followed by a more affordable \"DX\" version and then a high performance \"Turbo\" version.  The cars were typically released in kit form; however, Kyosho chose to release \"DX\" entry-level models partially assembled, making the car more attractive for customers who were completely new to the hobby.  Depending on the country of release, the DX models would also include Kyosho's own GS engine, which was already set up and ready to run. This further reduced the complexity and made an otherwise highly technical hobby more approachable for a larger audience.  \n\nThe success of this approach can be seen in the extent to which budget DX cars, that are available second hand, have been upgraded by their owners over time as they gained skill and confidence in the hobby. The Inferno's popularity also spawned a large number of 3rd party suppliers<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rc10talk.com/viewtopic.php?f=30&t=42144&start=105|title=3rd party optional parts for the classic Kyosho Inferno|website=www.rc10talk.com}}</ref> that provided additional performance accessories such as brake discs, carbon fiber plates etc. Original Kyosho parts for these cars were still mostly given the \"BS\" and \"BSW\" nomenclature from the Burns series of cars and were also partially compatible with them. Later models received part numbers starting with IF and IFW.   \n\nThe versatility of this platform also enabled Kyosho to create 1:8 scale road and rally cars called the \"Super Eight GP LANDMAX 4WD\"<ref name=\":10\" /> and the Inferno ST (Stadium Truck) series. The Landmax were based on the original Inferno chassis until 2001 and the original ST until 2005<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rcscrapyard.net/kyosho-inferno-st.htm|title=Kyosho Inferno ST on RC Scrapyard|website=www.rcscrapyard.net}}</ref>, nearly a decade after the production of the classic Inferno buggy ended.    \n\nAfter winning every world championship during its production run, the classic Inferno was phased out in favor of the MP5 in 1995. \n\n==== Inferno 4WD, item no. 3281 (late 1991 \u2013 late 1993) ====\nAs the successor to the Turbo Burns, the classic Inferno not only had a couple of the same parts, but also had a similar body design and countersunk chassis plate. The similarities were largely superficial however with only the following parts being interchangeable with its predecessor. \n* Differentials (however Burns had 2 bevel gears, classic and Turbo Inferno had 4, see comparison table below)<ref name=\":0\" /> \n* Wing and wing mount \n* Shock absorbers \n* Wishbones, hubs and axles\n* Fuel tank \n* Engine mount \n* Most screws, nuts, washers, etc. \nThe car introduced many new design elements and notable improvements which would largely continue in subsequent Inferno models \n* Single radio tray which held all electrical components and could be switched quickly as one unit when desired. (Burns radio tray did not hold the throttle servo)  \n* Stronger shock mounts with more mounting options \n* Differentials with 4 bevel gears (Burns had 2)<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/148807212@N06/37470601544/in/photostream/#|title=Kyosho Differential Comparison|website=Flickr}}</ref> \n* Two part diff housings for faster maintenance (Burns diff. housing consisted of 5 parts)\n* New wheels and tires \n** Wide at front and back (Burns had narrow wheels and tires at front with the exception of the limited edition Turbo Burns SCC)\n** Micro spike tires instead of regular spikes\n** Lighter wheels with narrower spokes\n* Separate front and rear disc brake (This was an optional part for the Burns towards the end of its production run and was supplied with the limited edition [[Kyosho Burns|Turbo Burns SCC]]. The Inferno brake setup is not compatible with the Burns series.)\n\n==== Inferno DX; item no. 3290h (1992\u20131994) ====\nJust like the [[Kyosho Burns|Burns series]], the \"DX\" referred to the entry-level specification car. Unlike the Burns, however, this DX came partially assembled and some metal parts such as the exhaust and shock absorbers were replaced with plastic parts. An overview of the differences can be seen in the table below. The BS121 ring and pinion gears were made from a cheaper alloy material instead of the steel gears which were found in the Classic and Turbo versions of the car<ref name=\":0\" />.\n\nUnlike the Inferno 4WD und Turbo Inferno, the chassis of the car had additional holes to mount the Kyosho GS21-CR series engine. This particular engine is recognizable by its heat-sink which has vertical instead of the more common horizontal fins<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/gp/148807212@N06/c20xB4|title=Kyosho .21 GS21-RC Head|website=Flickr}}</ref>. An interesting cost saving measure was also the lack of countersunk holes in the chassis which would have required an extra production step. This had not been seen since the original Burns.\n\n==== Turbo Inferno; item no. 31346 (1994\u20131995) ====\nContinuing the model naming of the [[Kyosho Burns|Burns series]], the first series of Inferno cars also used the name \"Turbo\" to signify the car with the largest number of performance parts. Visually the Turbo Inferno could easily be identified by the anodized blue chassis plate and larger capacity, blue shock absorbers. Interestingly Kyosho did not include the blue anodized plates which were mounted in the steering and center differential of the Inferno DXII which was released the following year. The Turbo Inferno also included newly designed green wheels, a green spoiler, and unique \"high grip\" tires (part W5646H) which were supplied from the factory. Other than that the car was very similar in specification to the Inferno 4WD as can be seen in the comparison table below. The new, rigid plastic spoiler was the first departure from the Lexan versions which had been used until that point and would remain standard equipment on all future Inferno models.\n\n==== Inferno DX II Ltd.; item no. 31552 (1995\u20131996) ====\nThe DXII used pieces from the initial classic Inferno 4WD, first Inferno DX and Turbo Burns. Most notable differences from the first DX were: \n* The plastic shock absorbers were replaced with those from the classic Inferno 4WD (same type as Turbo Burns)\n* The metal bearings were replaced with the ball bearings from the classic Inferno 4WD and Turbo Inferno\n* The plastic muffler and rubber manifold were replaced with the Aluminum tuned muffler and manifold from the older Turbo Burns\n* The Lexan wing was replaced with the hard plastic wing of the Turbo Inferno, however in the same yellow of the wheels instead of the Turbo's green. Although the part number of the wing stayed the same (BSW-71KY), Kyosho changed the color to neon yellow after the DXII was discontinued making the original yellow wing one of the hardest parts to find for collectors and restorers.\n\nIn addition the DXII had all blue anodized plates (with the exception of the chassis), and an additional hole in the chassis to accommodate a pull start. Some DXII kits also included the GS21-X engine. This engine had a new, larger head with horizontal fins to compensate for the overheating issues of the previous GS21-CR.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/gp/148807212@N06/wf62v7|title=Kyosho GS-21 X|website=Flickr}}</ref> The new head was available in plain aluminum (part 6520-31) and later with a blue anodized head (part 6520-31bl)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/gp/148807212@N06/L84349|title=Kyosho GS21 X later model heat sink 6520-31|website=Flickr}}</ref> to match the other blue plates on the car.\n\nAs there was no entry-level \"Sports\" version of the subsequent MP5 model the Inferno DXII remained Kyosho's entry-level car until 1996. Kyosho would not release another entry level 1/8 Buggy until the MP6 Sports in 1999. \n\n==== Overview of main differences between classic Inferno models ====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|\u00a0\n|'''Part name'''\n|'''Turbo Inferno'''\n|'''Inferno 4WD'''\n|'''Inferno DX'''\n|'''Inferno DXII Limited'''\n|-\n|'''1'''\n|Differential ring gear\n|BS14*\n|BS14*\n|BS121\n|BS121\n|-\n|'''2'''\n|Differential pinion gear\n|BS14*\n|BS14*\n|BS121\n|BS121\n|-\n|'''3'''\n|Differential bevel gear (S)\n|BS37 (2 pairs per  diff)\n|BS37 (2 pairs per  diff)\n|BS37 (1 pair per diff)\n|BS37 (1 pair per diff)\n|-\n|'''4'''\n|Differential bevel gear (L)\n|BSW64\n|BS36\n|BS36\n|BS36\n|-\n|'''5'''\n|Tires\n|W5646H\n|BSW40\n|BSW40\n|BSW40\n|-\n|'''6'''\n|Chassis\n|BS108**** (blue anodized)\n|BS108\n|BS120\n|GT28\n|-\n|'''7'''\n|Ball bearings\n|Full\n|Full\n|Metal Bushings\n|Full\n|-\n|'''8'''\n|Wheels\n|BSW80KG\n|BS105\n|BS105\n|BS105\n|-\n|'''9'''\n|Wing\n|BSW71KG (Plastic)***\n|BSW5 (Lexan)\n|BSW5 (Lexan)\n|BSW71KY (Plastic)***\n|-\n|'''10'''\n|Shocks\n|BSW72 + BSW73\n|BSW27 + BSW28\n|2001 & 2002  plastic\n|BSW27 + BSW28\n|-\n|'''11'''\n|Front Axels\n|BS20 (Universal)**\n|BS20 (Universal)**\n|BS45 (Dog Bones)\n|BS45 (Dog Bones)\n|-\n|'''12'''\n|Center Diff \n|BSW34 (Adjustable)\n|BSW34 (Adjustable)\n| -\n| -\n|-\n|'''13'''\n|Spur gear\n|BS11\n|BS11\n|BS122\n|BS122\n|-\n|'''14'''\n|Stabilizer\n|BS63 + BSW79\n| -\n| -\n| -\n|-\n|'''15'''\n|Fuel Tank\n|BS65\n|BS65\n|BS28\n|BS65\n|-\n|'''16'''\n|Exhaust\n| -\n| -\n|BS123\n|BS64\n|-\n|'''17'''\n|Manifold\n| -\n| -\n|BS124\n|BS26\n|-\n|'''18'''\n|Engine\n| -\n| -\n|Kyosho GS21CR (optional)\n|Kyosho GS21X\n|-\n|'''19'''\n|Plate Set\n|BS115 + BS116\n|BS115 + BS116\n|BS115 + BS116\n|BS115 + BS116 (both blue anodized)\n|}\n<nowiki>*</nowiki>Depending on the market and year of production the Turbo Infernos and Inferno 4WDs may also have been supplied with BSW-1 and BSW-2 hardened gears from the factory instead of the standard BS-14 set.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.rc10talk.com/viewtopic.php?f=30&t=42144&start=45&sid=ac245d6201ce746288d802c59dd88a5a|title=BSW-1 and BSW-2 gear discussion on RC10Talk|website=RC10Talk}}</ref>\n\n<nowiki>**</nowiki> Kyosho changed the part numbering of BS20 universal joint to IFW62 in the later references.\n\n<nowiki>***</nowiki> Kyosho eventually changed the part numbering of the BSW71 wing to  IFW213.

The later MP5 and MP6 had similar parts which however were <u>not</u> compatible with the classic Inferno. \n\nThe BSW-55 special diff housing and BSW-82 One Way Diff are among the most rare and expensive parts on the second-hand market<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/gp/148807212@N06/3Y9921|title=BSW-55, BSW-82 and BSW-19 on Flickr|website=Flickr}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/148807212@N06/38181097951/in/photostream/|title=BSW-55 & BSW-82 disassembled on Flickr|website=Flickr}}</ref>.\n\nOne of the more common, and frequently discussed optional parts are the hardened BSW-1 and BSW-2 differential gears<ref name=\":4\" />. It is also the only series of infernos that had 3 different specifications of differentials (depending on the country of sale). As can be seen in the table above the budget Inferno DX models used a cheaper alloy gear set (BS-121), while the mid-range Inferno 4WD cars came with the BS-14 from the Burns generation, and the Turbo Inferno was supplied with the BS-14 or the optional BSW-1 and BSW-2 set depending on the country of sale.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n=== Box art and marketing material ===\nThe Inferno series continued the same style of box art and marketing material of its predecessor using mostly studio pictures of assembled and painted models. The only exception was the Turbo Inferno which came in a plane white and green box with a drawn outline of the car on the front<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.retromodelisme.com/voiture/255-1/turbo-inferno-kit-kyosho.html|title=Turbo Inferno Unboxing|website=www.retromodelisme.com}}</ref>. The Inferno and Inferno DX/DXII came with a box which had an integrated handle.\n\n=== Collectibillity and current popularity (1996\u2013) ===\nAs with the [[Kyosho Burns|Burns]], the most collectible of this initial line-up is the Turbo version. This is in part due to its rarity, especially in good condition. Collectors specifically look for cars on which the blue anodized chassis has no damage, as well as unused tires as these are very hard to find as spare parts. The demand and value on the second hand market is however significantly lower than the Turbo Burns which preceded it, with near mint condition cars with box often selling for less than 200 US Dollars. Collectors are also interested in the first DX in its original configuration as these were typically upgraded by their owners over time. Their original [[Kyosho]] engine, plastic shock absorbers and exhaust being discarded for higher performance parts \n\nDue to the low re-sale value and an abundance of spare parts, as well as reproduction parts such as new bodies and decals<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.marwanrc.com/main.sc;jsessionid=4EC1D4EC52D4AE3E818C846D4BFFD2A6.p3plqscsfapp003|title=Marwan RC|website=MarwanRC}}</ref>, the Inferno 4WD and Turbo Inferno are a good choice for entry and intermediate level RC buggy enthusiasts. Scans of the original instruction manuals for the various Inferno models are also available online.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.retromodelisme.com/liste_manuel.html|title=Manual search page on retromodelise.com|last=|first=|date=|website=retromodelisme|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>   \n\nIn lieu of noise restrictions and the advances of battery and brushless technology, some cars are also being converted to an electric powertrain<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.modelbouwforum.nl/threads/kyosho-inferno-dx-brushless.222967/|title=Kyosho Inferno DX Brushless|website=modelbouwforum.nl}}</ref>.\n\n== Inferno MP5 & MP6 (1995\u20132002) ==\n\n===  Models and specifications ===\nThe MP5 was the first of kyosho's 1:8 buggy line up to use the \"MP\" (Model Project), name in public and was largely a clean break from it predecessors as far as the \"BS\" and \"BSW\" parts compatibility is concerned.  The few remaining parts which are still compatible with the previous Burns cars (MP1-MP2) include the 19mm hex wheels (which would later be changed to 17mm on the Inferno 7.5 as a new industry standard), and the fuel tank. A few other parts such as the wing design, shock absorbers and brake discs were carried across from the Turbo Inferno.\n\nThe MP5/MP6 also included some new design features which remain with the current Inferno line up. \n* Upward angle (kick-up) at the front of chassis<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tamiyaclub.com/showroom_model.asp?cid=121580&id=5484|title=Kyosho MP5 Unboxing|website=Tamiya Club}}</ref>\n* Splash resistant box for receiver and other electronics (instead of being mounted on the radio tray with the servos)\n\nLike its predecessors, the MP3 and MP4 Infernos, the MP5 & MP6 won every [[International Federation of Model Auto Racing|IFMAR]] title during their production run, first in its standard form and later with the EVO editions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.neobuggy.net/2012/11/27/the-world-champions-cars-2010-1986/|title=RC 1:8 Buggy World Championship Winners 1986-2010|website=Neobuggy.net}}</ref> The MP5 and MP6 are visually nearly identical using the same body and wheels, however the MP6 had a longer chassis and wider rear track. Prior to the MP6 this relatively small change was also available on the MP5 in form of a long wheelbase conversion kit. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tamiyaclub.com/showroom_model.asp?cid=53264&sid=5484|title=Kyosho MP5 Long Wheelbase conversion kit|website=TamiyaClub.com}}</ref> \n\n====  MP5, item no. 31551 (1995\u20131998) ====\nAs with the previous Burns and Inferno models Kyosho released an intermediate level car first. Unlike its predecessors, however, no entry level MP5 was produced. \n\nThe MP5 won the world championship in 1996<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rcscrapyard.net/kyosho-Inferno-mp5.htm|title=MP5 on RCScrapyard|website=RC Scrapyard}}</ref>, and was marketed as a competition buggy with many in-house options being made available within its first year of production. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rcmagvintage.com/reviews/retro/voitures/tt/musee/kyosho/catalogues/minicataloguemp5/minicataloguemp5.htm|title=MP5 Options Catalog|website=RCMagvintage}}</ref> \n\n==== MP5 With Picco P6B, item no. 31663P (1996) ====\nA standard Inferno MP5 model packed from the factory with a Picco P6B engine, also includes a manifold and muffler.

It was released in 1996 and included a few parts from the options catalog<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tamiyaclub.com/showroom_model.asp?cid=123736&sid=5484|title=MP5 EVO 1 Unboxing and Additional Instruction Manual|website=Tamiya Club}}</ref>. Unlike the standard MP5 which was supplied with the white wheels and wing that were featured on the box art, the EVO1 was supplied with a set of green wheels and a green wing. The car was sold for one year before being replaced by the EVO2.\n\n==== MP5 EVO2, item no. 31781 (1997\u20131998) ====\nThe EVO2 was based closely on the car which won the 1996 World Championship<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.tamiyaclub.com/showroom_model.asp?cid=114210|title=Kyosho MP5 EVO2 Unboxing|website=Tamiya Club}}</ref> Among various options the most noticeable difference to the previous MP5 models was the longer chassis and rear wishbones which were later used for the MP6.

In addition to the shock towers, all other Aluminum plates on the MP6 models were also anodized in blue. The unique feature of this \"standard\" MP6 is the gold anodized chassis plate which is highly sought after in good condition.\n\nA special edition was later released featuring the large capacity shocks of the MP6 International<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/gp/148807212@N06/71p5ti|title=MP6 Standard special large shock edition|website=Flickr}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/gp/148807212@N06/92W457|title=MP6 Standard, special large shock edition|website=Flickr}}</ref>.\n\n==== MP6 Sport, item no. 31951 (1999\u20132002) ====\nFormerly referred to as the \"DX\" for the Burns and classic Inferno series of cars, the \"Sport\" was the entry-level car for the MP6 range. It had similar specification changes as the Inferno DXII and was also supplied with a Kyosho GS21 engine with a blue head to match the blue theme of the car (part 6520-31bl).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.oocities.org/clubtt/buggys.html|title=MP6 Overview|website=Geocities}}</ref> Kyosho supplied the sport with a 3&nbsp;mm chassis instead of the 2.5&nbsp;mm of the standard MP6<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.offroad-cult.org/Tracktest/Inferno%20MP6%20SPORTS/Kyosho%20MP6%20Sports.htm|title=MP6 Sports review|website=Offroad Cult}}</ref>. This may lead one to believe that this was a stronger version to outlive the driving of a novice driver; however, the 2.5&nbsp;mm was actually made from a harder alloy. As with the \"DX\" cars, it was possible to upgrade this car to a standard or international version but at a significantly greater cost than if one had bought the international kit directly.\n\n==== MP6 International, item no. 31892 (1998\u20132002) ====\nThe term MP6 \"International\" was used instead of the \"EVO\" nomenclature used to describe performance versions of the MP5 series. The word \"International\" would not be used in this context again but would reappear from the MP9 TKI2 to TKI4, with the \"TKI\" standing for \"Team Kyosho International\". Unlike the MP5 EVO which only had a selection of optional parts, the MP6 featured almost every available option.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tamiyaclub.com/showroom_model.asp?cid=48595|title=Kyosho MP6 International Unboxing|website=Tamiya Club}}</ref> As most of these options were already available for the MP5, the MP6 International could be released only one year after sales for the standard MP6 started.\n\n==== Overview of main differences between MP5 & MP6 models ====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|\u00a0\n|'''Part name'''\n|'''MP5'''\n|'''MP5 EVO1'''\n|'''MP5 EVO2'''\n|'''MP6'''\n|'''MP6 Sport'''\n|'''MP6 International'''\n|-\n|1\n|Ball  bearings\n|Full\n|Full\n|Full\n|Full\n|Full\n|Full\n|-\n|2\n|Brakes\n|IF-28\n|IF-28\n|IF-28\n|IFW-53\n|IF-28\n|IFW-53 but with double disc\n|-\n|3\n|Center  Shaft front\n|IF-33 (dogbone)\n|IF-33 (dogbone)\n|IFW-12 (universal)\n|IF-33 (dogbone)\n|IF-33 (dogbone)\n|IFW-12 (universal)\n|-\n|4\n|Center  Shaft rear\n| IF-33 (dogbone)\n| IF-33 (dogbone)\n| IFW-45 (universal)\n| IF-33 (dogbone)\n| IF-33 (dogbone)\n|IFW-45 (universal)\n|-\n|5\n|Chassis\n|IF-4 (2,5mm)\n|IF-4 (2,5mm)\n|IFW-41 (3mm counter sunk)\n|IF-44 (2,5mm, Gold)\n|(3mm not counter sunk)\n|IFW-41 (3mm counter sunk)\n|-\n|6\n|Differential  pinion gear\n|IF-21\n|IF-21\n|IF-21\n|IF-21\n|IF-61\n|IF-21\n|-\n|7\n|Differential  ring gear\n|IF-20\n|IF-20\n|IF-20\n|IF-20\n|IF-61\n|IF-20\n|-\n|8\n|Engine\n| -\n| -\n| -\n| -\n|Kyosho GS21R\n| -\n|-\n|9\n|Manifold & Exhaust\n| -\n| -\n| -\n| -\n|BS-124 & GT-47\n| -\n|-\n|10\n|Front  Axels\n|BS-20 (universal)*\n|BS-20 (universal)*\n|BS-20 (universal)*\n|BS-20 (universal)*\n|dogbone\n|BS-20 (universal)*\n|-\n|11\n|Front  Shock Stay\n|IF-3\n|IF-3\n|IFW-20\n|IF-47\n|IF-47\n|IFW-20\n|-\n|12\n|Front  torque rod\n| -\n| -\n|IFW-06\n| -\n|IFW-43\n|IFW-43\n|-\n|13\n|Main  Gear 46T\n|IF-22 (plastic)\n|IF-22 (plastic)\n|IFW-03 (steel)\n|IF-22 (plastic)\n|IF-22 (plastic)\n|IFW-03 (steel)\n|-\n|14\n|Manifold\n| -\n| -\n| -\n| -\n|BS124\n| -\n|-\n|15\n|Rear  Axels\n|BS-45 (dogbone)\n|BS-45 (dogbone)\n|IFW-42 (universal)\n|BS-45 (dogbone)\n|BS-45 (dogbone)\n|IFW-42 (universal)\n|-\n|16\n|Servo  Saver\n|IF-18\n|IF-18\n|IFW-04 (ball bearing)\n|IF-18\n|IF-18\n|IFW-04 (ball bearing)\n|-\n|17\n|Shocks\n| BSW72 + BSW73\n| BSW72 + BSW73\n|IFW30 + IFW31\n| BSW72 + BSW73\n|BSW72 + BSW73\n|IFW30 + IFW31\n|-\n|18\n|Springs\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|IFW-33W\n|-\n|19\n|Stabilizer  Front\n| -\n| -\n| -\n| -\n| -\n|IFW-05\n|-\n|20\n|Stabilizer  Rear\n|IF-32\n|IF-32\n|IF-32\n|IF-32\n|IF-32\n|IFW-21 (thicker)\n|-\n|21\n|Steering  Plate\n|IF-19\n|IF-19\n|IFW-14 (blue)\n|IF-19\n|IFW-14 (blue)\n|IFW-14 (blue)\n|-\n|22\n|Steering  Rod Set\n| IF-19\n| IF-19\n| IFW-02 (adjustable)\n| IF-19\n|IF-19\n| IFW-02 (adjustable)\n|-\n|23\n|Wheel  stopper\n| \n| \n| \n| \n|IFW-44 (wide)\n| \n|-\n|24\n|Wheels\n|BSW80W\n|BSW80KG\n|None\n|BSW80W\n|BSW80BL\n|None\n|-\n|25\n|Wing\n| BSW71W\n| BSW71KG\n| None\n| BSW71W\n|BSW71BL\n| None\n|-\n|26\n|Wing  Collar Stay\n|IF-25\n|IF-25\n|IFW-07 (blue)\n|IF-25\n|IF-25\n|IFW-07 (blue)\n|}\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> Kyosho changed the part numbering of BS20 universal swing to IFW62 in the later references.\n\n=== Notable optional parts ===\nMost of the in-house optional parts were available on the MP6 international and were relatively common compared to the Burns and Classic Inferno options due to the volume of cars that Kyosho was producing and selling by this point. As with the Classic Inferno, the rarest part is the special aluminum center diff, which in this case had part number IFW-8.  It was essentially very similar to the plastic parts they replaced and much less complex that the BSW-55 aluminum differential of the classic Inferno. As it was not provided with the MP6 International, unlike almost all other optional parts, one could assume that Kyosho did not consider it a cost-effective or desirable item.\n\n=== Box art and marketing material ===\nUnlike previous models, the cars on the front of the box of the MP5 and MP6 series were shown with bodies that were unpainted, clearly showing the internals of the car. Only a part of the front of the car had a semi transparent indication of the official paint scheme which could be found on the cars depicted on other parts of the box and in the marketing material.\n\nAlso, unlike the previous inferno models, the box art was largely the same regardless of the version of the car. The main box art showed the initial version of the car (standard MP5 or MP6), with different iterations being indicated by a label at the bottom right corner of the box. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tamiyaclub.com/showroom_model.asp?cid=123736|title=Kyosho MP5 Evo Box|website=www.tamiyaclub.com}}</ref>  \n\nAn exception to this was the MP6 sport which had a clearly distinguishable box-art, and a car with a painted body.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tamiyaclub.com/showroom_model.asp?cid=132478&id=5484|title=Kyosho MP6 Box|website=www.tamiyaclub.com}}</ref> \n\nTo an extent, Kyosho used different colored wheels and wings to highlight the versions of the car on the main box-art however the color coding of these parts was sometimes not the same between the pictures seen in on the box and catalogs, and those which were available in the box. \n\n {| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Car\n!Main Box-Art\n!Main Catalog\n!Sold in Box\n|-\n|MP5\n|White\n|White\n|White\n|-\n|MP5 Evo1\n|White\n|White\n|Green\n|-\n|MP5 Evo2\n|White\n|White\n|None\n|-\n|MP6\n|Orange\n|White\n|None\n|-\n|MP6 Sport\n|Blue\n|Blue\n|Blue\n|-\n|MP6 Int.\n|Orange\n|Green (studio photo) & Orange (track photo)\n|None\n|}\n\n=== Collectibillity and current popularity (2002\u2013) ===\nAt the time of writing in 2018, the MP5 & MP6 are slowly attaining \"classic\" car status<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.classic.rc-junkies.net/?page_id=204|title=What makes a classic?|website=Classic RC Junkies}}</ref> and are not yet particularly sought after on the second hand market. Because of this, good condition MP5 Evo2's or MP6 Internationals are still affordable and parts cars are readily available. This can enable starting hobbyist to have what was once world championship winning technology for a relatively low price. Optional parts are also more readily available and cheaper than those for its Burns and Inferno predecessors.\n\nThe MP6 Sports did not have a good reputation due to its relatively high price and low performance<ref name=\":3\" /> and is typically only sought after by enthusiasts looking to complete a collection. As with the Inferno DX prices for these in good, original condition are relatively high as owners typically discarded the original, low cost parts.   \n\n== Inferno MP7.5  (2000\u20132004, 2009 for \"Sports\" models) ==\n\n===  Models and specifications ===\nAfter nearly 5 years of evolution rather than revolution with the MP5 and MP6 series of cars, Kyosho released the MP 7.5 which was redesigned from the ground up. The \".5\" allegedly stands for the 5 consecutive IFMAR World Championships which had been won by the Inferno series at the time of its release.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vintage-rc.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=141&t=20914&start=30|title=Kyosho Timeline Discussion|website=Vintage-RC}}</ref> \n\n==== MP7.5, item no. 31081 (2000\u20132004) ====\nAs with the other Infernos before it, this first release would provide a good intermediate level car, which could be upgraded to competition specifications relatively quickly. As with the later Kanai competition versions, the selection of the radio gear, motor and muffler were left to the buyer and were not included in the kit.  \n\n==== MP7.5 Sports v1, item no. 31192 (2001\u20132005), v2 item no. 31276 (2005\u20132009), v3 item no. 31278 (2009), v4 item no. 31279 (2009) ====\nFollowing the tradition of previous generations of the Inferno series, the entry level \"Sports\" variant was released a year after the initial mid-range car. It was largely pre-built (often branded as a \"Ready Set\")<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.infernosonly.com/Kyosho_Inferno_Sports_4_Ready_Set_p/kyo31279t2-b.htm|title=Inforno Sports v4 for sale at Infernosonly.com|website=www.infernosonly.com}}</ref>, and was supplied with Kyosho's own GX-21 engine, a pre-painted body and the necessary remote control hardware. It was setup to be easy to drive, with a wide power band and with a price tag of under 400 US Dollars it was aimed at casual and novice drivers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rcmart.com/kyosho-31275-inferno-mp75-sports-bluewhite-p-13165.html|title=RC Mart MP7.5 Sports|website=RC Mart}}</ref> In line with previous DX and Sports version there are a significant number of differences in the type and quality of parts between this entry level car, and the intermediate and competition variants. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showthread.php?130955-Differences-between-Inferno-MP7-5-and-Sports-version|title=RC Groups, differences between MP7.5 Standard and MP7.5 Sports.|website=RCGroups.com}}</ref> During its production cycle there were 4 different releases of the MP7.5 Sports which had slightly different specifications and different color body shells, wheels and wings.\n\nAs there was no entry level model for the MP777 which succeeded the MP7.5 in 2005, Kyosho continued manufacturing the Sports versions of the MP 7.5 until 2009 at which point the MP777 was also discontinued.\n\n==== MP7.5 Kanai 1, item no. 31191 (2000\u20132001) ====\nThis was the first ever car in the Kyosho line up to bare the name of its designer and factory race driver Yuichi Kanai. Yuichi Kanai developed all of the Kyosho 1/8 off-road buggies from the Kyosho Turbo Burns onward <ref name=\":1\" /> and was actively competing with the MP7.5 at the time. His name was used for the editions of the car that were released with a selection of the modifications he developed during the race seasons. Quad center disc brakes, special chassis and arms and a special rear wing were a few of the modifications. The Kanai editions were aimed to be competition ready cars for experienced, competitive drivers.\n\n==== MP7.5 Kanai 2, item no. 31271 (2001\u20132002) ====\nThe Kanai 2 was an evolution of the Kanai 1 and focused on improved strength and steering geometry, and had double disk brakes<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rcuniverse.com/forum/rc-1-8th-scale-buggies/2370135-whats-kyosho-difference-print.html|title=MP7.5 Differences|website=www.RCUniverse.com}}</ref>. \n\n==== MP7.5 Kanai 3, item no. 31273 (2002\u20132004) ====\nThis was the final version of the MP7.5 which incorporated the lessons learned from the preceding IFMAR championships and other races in which the MP7.5 competed. This car relied less on completely re-designed parts but instead on slight modifications to existing parts to improve the setup and reliability of the car. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rcmart.com/kyosho-31273-inferno-mp75-yuichi-kanai-p-6078.html|title=RC Mart MP7.5 Kanai 3|website=RC Mart}}</ref> As with other performance variants, this model did not include items such as radio equipment, engine and mufflers as the ideal selection of these were highly dependent on both the track and the driver. In its original condition, the Kanai 3 can be recognized through its milled out chassis and titanium screws. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rctech.net/forum/nitro-off-road/813208-kyosho-mp7-5-kanai.html|title=RCTech MP7.5 Kanai|website=RC Tech}}</ref>\n\n=== Collectibillity and current popularity (2008\u2013) ===\nThe MP7.5 has many years to go before it becomes a classic. Due to the volumes that Kyosho produced it and the fact that there were no special, limited editions of the car, they are also of limited interest to collectors. They do however provide an excellent platform for brushless electric conversion with Kyosho<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite web|url=http://rc.kyosho.com/en/ifw451.html|title=Kyosho Inferno Brushless Conversion Kit|website=www.kyosho.com}}</ref> and many 3rd party suppliers providing conversion kits. They are one of the most common and most economical secondhand Kyosho 1/8 scale cars available on the second hand market. This makes the 7.5 an excellent car for beginners who are looking for relatively modern technology with an abundance of replacement and performance parts with the option to convert to brushless if desired.\n\n== Inferno MP777  (2004\u20132008) ==\n\n=== Models and specifications ===\nThe MP777 was released in 2004 to celebrate 6 successive wins at the IFMAR world championships.<ref name=\":1\" /> The fact that this car was more of an evolution than a revolution compared to its predecessor is reflected through the retention of the number 7 as the first character of the model number. The main focus of the MP777 was increased durability, better fine tuning options, and improved handling characteristics by moving the center of gravity.  \n\n==== MP777, item no. 31777 (2004\u20132008) ====\nAmong the main changes to the layout and construction of the MP777 there was a newly positioned center of gravity, as well as longer stroke for the rear suspension and more suspension pin angles.  The durability was improved through additional components such as a muffler guard to prevent damage from lateral hits, guarded front hubs, and a newly designed \"dish type\" wheel to prevent dirt from getting in the axels on muddy tracks. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.winrctech.com.hk/product_sub2_sub1.php?id=35&sid=7&bid=1&cc=1|title=MP777 Specs|website=www.winrctech.com.hk}}</ref> Although these changes do not seem significant they provided the foundation to win the IFMAR championship title that followed in Indonesia in 2006.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rccaraction.com/2012-ifmar-18-scale-off-road-world-championships-are-almost-here/|title=List of IFMAR Winners 1986 to 2010|website=www.rccaraction.com}}</ref>\n\n==== MP777 SP 1, item no. 31778 (2004\u20132005) ====\nThe SP1 had a number of upgrades including a \"traction control\" front differential, a machined Duralumin engine mount, various blue anodized alloy parts and also had a set of dampers which had a special coating on the inside to reduce friction. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://rc.kyosho.com/en/31779.html|title=MP777 SP1 on Kyosho website|website=www.kyosho.com}}</ref>  \n\n==== MP777 SP 2, item no. 31779 & 31779S21 (2005\u20132006) ====\nThe SP2 had a couple of differences which were not apparent in the marketing material as this used the same car as the SP1.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://rc.kyosho.com/en/31779.html|title=MP777 SP2 on Kyosho website|website=www.kyosho.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.kyosho.com/jpn/fun/magazine/pdf/rcw0510_1.pdf|title=Kyosho sales brochure|website=www.kyosho.com}}</ref> These included a wheelbase which had been lengthened by 4mm while the engine and R/C system had been moved 1.5mm to the rear to improve the stability and steering characteristics. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.winrctech.com.hk/product_sub2_sub1.php?id=36&sid=7&bid=1&cc=1|title=MP777 SP2 Specs|website=www.winrctech.com.hk}}</ref>  \n\nThere was also a special edition with item number 31779S21 which included a Sirio S21BK EVO-2 engine, exhaust and manifold. \n==== MP777 WC, item no. 31780 & 31780S21 (2006\u20132008) ====\nThe MP777 WC Team Edition Kit came with a S21BK EVO-2 STI Motor. The car was a replica of the one which won the 7th IFMAR world championship.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://rc.kyosho.com/en/31780s21.html|title=Kyosho MP777 WC 31780S21|website=www.kyosho.com}}</ref>   \n\n=== Collectibillity and current popularity (2008\u2013) ===\nThe MP777 has many years to go before it becomes a classic, and because of the large number that were produced they are not very rare (with the exception of the \"s21\" model numbers with the Sirio engine). Therefore, most are of limited interest to collectors. They do, however, provide an excellent platform for brushless electric conversions with Kyosho,<ref name=\":6\" /> and many third-party suppliers provide conversion kits.\n\n== Inferno MP9  (2008\u20132018) ==\n\n=== Models and specifications ===\nSimilar to Microsoft skipping Windows 9, or Apple the iPhone 9, the omission of an Kyosho MP8 model indicated a revolution between the new MP9 and the previous MP7X models. Despite being redesigned from the ground up, the process apparently only took 6 months.<ref name=\":1\" /> A true indication of this revolution is the fact that the MP9 also embraced the new brushless electric motor technology from the factory in addition to the traditional two stroke engine.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://rc.kyosho.com/en/30898.html|title=MP9e TKI4 on Kyosho Website|website=www.kyosho.com}}</ref> It shares almost no parts with the previous MP7X generation and from the second car onward the abbreviation \"TKI\" which stands for \"Team Kyosho International\" was added to the model name which had not been used before. \n\nThe MP9 has been less successful over its lifetime that the other Inferno models with only one win in 2010 by US driver Cody King <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.femca-rc.com/?attachment_id=2583|title=IFMAR Winners 1986-2018|website=www.femca-rc.com}}</ref>, however there is also now considerably more competition as the cost of engineering and production of the vehicles has decreased over time. Nevertheless, it has won many other competitions and also earned a respectable second place at the IFMAR in 2016. <ref name=\":8\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.amazon.de/Kyosho-Inferno-TKI4-Buggy-Upgrade/dp/B01F3XLZ70|title=Kyosho TKI3 to TKI4 upgrade kit|website=www.amazon.com}}</ref>  \n\n==== MP9, item no. 31782 & 31783 (2008\u20132010) ====\nAlthough the internals of the car were new from the ground up <ref name=\":1\" />, the body still harked back to the long swooping lines and curves of previous Inferno models. This would start to change from the TKI2 model onward. Different from the MP6 and MP7.5 generations, the budget conscious version of the MP9 no longer used the \"Sports\" branding. Instead it was simply known as number 31783. As with previous entry level cars, the focus lay on keeping the overall characteristics and functionality of the car the same, with the main cost savings being in the materials and level of finish applied to the individual components.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://rc.kyosho.com/en/31783.html|title=MP9 71783 Entry Level model|website=www.kyosho.com}}</ref>  There were no \"ready-set\" pre-assembled cars in this first release.  \n\n==== MP9TKI2, item no. 31784, 31785, 31785CK, 31785JT, 31786 & 31787 (2010\u20132012) ====\nWith the ever increasing speed of the cars, aerodynamics of the body started to play a more important role. This was also noticeable in the marketing material for later models. <ref name=\":7\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.amainhobbies.com/kyosho-inferno-mp9-tki4-10th-anniversary-special-edition-1-8-nitro-buggy-kit-kyo33011b/p733364|title=MP9 TKI4 10 anniversary edition at Amainhobbies|website=www.ammainhobbies.com}}</ref> The \"cabin\" section of the body became more steeply racked and the back of the body was tapered upwards towards the spoiler. These changes started a shift away from the traditional drawn out, rounded lines that started with the [[Kyosho Burns|Turbo Burns]] back in the late 1980s. The TKI2 started with a semi-assembled 31784 <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://rc.kyosho.com/en/discontinued/dis-rccar/gpoffroad/31784.html|title=MP9 item no.31784 semi assembled on kyosho website|website=www.kyosho.com}}</ref> and a regular un-assembled 31785 kit. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://rc.kyosho.com/en/31785.html|title=MP9 TKI2 31785|website=www.kyosho.com}}</ref>\n\nAnother first was the launch of limited edition models named after Kyosho team drivers Cody King<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://rc.kyosho.com/en/discontinued/dis-rccar/gpoffroad/31785ck.html|title=MP9 TKI2CR Cody King Special|website=www.kyosho.com}}</ref> who won the IFMAR championship in 2010, and [[Jared Tebo]] who was the top qualifier.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://rc.kyosho.com/en/discontinued/dis-rccar/gpoffroad/31785jt.html|title=MP9 TKI2JT Jared Tebo special edition|website=www.kyosho.com}}</ref> They had set numbers 31785CK and 31785JT respectively. The cars were released to celebrate the 8th IFMAR victory and featured the same engine as the championship winning car. Depending on the model, either King's or Tebo's signatures were engraved on the mufflers. As with the MP777 there was also a general World Championship \"WC\" car released which was not driver specific. It had item number 31786 <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://rc.kyosho.com/en/discontinued/dis-rccar/gpoffroad/31786.html|title=MP9 TKI2 31786 Semi Assembled|website=www.kyosho.com}}</ref>  followed by a semi-assembled \"Spec A\" version of the same car with item number 31787<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://rc.kyosho.com/en/31787.html|title=MP9 TKI2 WC Limited Edition Spec-A|website=www.kyosho.com}}</ref>. This was the final release for the TKI2 range of cars.     \n\n==== MP9TKI3, item no. 31788 & 31888 & 31889T1  (2012\u20132016) ====\nThe TKI3 was a relatively minor evolution of the TKI2 focusing on strengthening certain components and re-positioning of some parts to further optimize the handling. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://rc.kyosho.com/en/31788.html|title=MP9 TKI3|website=www.kyosho.com}}</ref> The big change in the TKI3 line-up was the introduction of a ready-set car which was completely pre-assembled and featured metal parts that were stamped rather than machined to further reduce the cost.<ref name=\":9\">{{Cite web|url=http://rc.kyosho.com/en/31889t1.html|title=MP9 TKI3 Ready Set|website=www.kyosho.com}}</ref> There were two model numbers, 31888 and 31889T1 which both had KE21R engines. Based on Kyosho's archive, the 31889T1 was roughly 25% cheaper than a regular, un-assembled version (approx. 60,000 vs. 80,000 Yen), yet included an engine and all necessary electronics.<ref name=\":9\" /> The car appeared to be less of a compromise compared to previous \"Sports\" iterations and offered a more competitive car for entry level enthusiast. Continuing the public's interest in \"ready-set\" cars, the MP9TKI3 was also released as a palm sized Mini-Z version which could be driven indoors and had item number 32081BB. This was the first indication of a true commercialization for the Kyosho Inferno brand.\n\n==== MP9TKI4, item no. 33001, 33007, 30898 & KYO33011B (2016\u20132018) ====\nIn 2016 the TKI4 earned a respectable second place at the IFMAR championships however the changes between the TKI3 and TKI4 were probably among the smallest between Kyosho releases. This can be seen from the parts available in the TKI3 upgrade pack provided by Kyosho.<ref name=\":8\" /> This car was also available as a partially assembled \"Spec-A\" variant with number 33007. The innovation which might have been missing between the TKI3 and TKI4 was definitely compensated for by the MP9e brushless Kit with number 30898. This was the first electric 1:8 off-road buggy that Kyosho had released from the factory and showed the company embracing an entirely different type of technology which not only brings drastic changes to the way a car handles and performs but also requires entirely new parts and a different layout to maintain similar handling characteristics.\n\nIn 2018 an important milestone was reached as the TKI4 welcomed the 10th anniversary of the MP9 series of cars (number KYO33011B). 10 years is the longest production run of any of the 1/8 Kyosho off-road models. This edition also includes many optional parts in the standard kit and is the highest-spec. TKI4.<ref name=\":7\" /> Even more impressive is that in 2018 one also celebrated 30 years since the release of the [[Kyosho Burns|MP1 Burns series]] which essentially set the foundation for all the 1:8 Kyosho Buggys that followed.\n\n== Inferno MP10  (2019\u2013) ==\n\n=== Models and specifications ===\n==== MP10, item no. 33015 (2019\u2013) ====\nIn January 2019 Kyosho released the new MP10  marking an end to the 10-year production cycle of the MP9. The new car was redesigned from the ground up and Kyosho goes to great lengths to show this by illustrating the main changes to the MP9 in detail on the MP10's webpage. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://rc.kyosho.com/en/inferno-mp10/|title=Inferno MP10 on Kyosho main page|website=www.kyosho.com}}</ref> \n\n== External references and citations ==\n=== External references ===\n* [http://www.rcmagvintage.com/viewforum.php?f=105 Vintage Kyosho Thread at rcmagvintage.com]\n* [http://www.retromodelisme.com/home.html Kyosho Thread on Retromodelisme]\n* [https://www.tamiyaclub.com/forum/index.php?/forum/20-kyosho/ Kyosho Thread on Tamiyaclub.com] \n* [http://www.rcuniverse.com/forum/rc-classic-cars-trucks-513/9089874-vintage-kyosho-buggy-truck-pics-post-them.html Vintage Kyosho Buggy Thread on RCUniverse.com] \n* [http://www.rc-forum.de/forumdisplay.php?693-Kyosho-Offroad Kyosho Thread on RC-Forum.de]\n\n=== Works cited ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n\n\n[[Category:Model cars]]\n[[Category:Kyosho]]\n", "name_user": "Schotte", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eCollectibillity and current popularity (1996\u2013)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyosho_Inferno"}
