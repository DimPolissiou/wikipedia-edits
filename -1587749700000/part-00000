The film was produced in 1960 and theatrically released in 1961. \n\n''Nude on the Moon'' is the second of eight [[nudist films]] produced and directed by Wishman. While most nudist films of the time were set within a conventional [[nudist camp]], apparently as a promotional [[gimmick]] Wishman decided to set the story in a [[nudist]] civilization on the Moon.\n\n==Plot==\n\nScientist Dr. Jeff Huntley inherits a fortune from his uncle and invests it in the development of a rocket ship, built with the assistance of his mentor, Dr. Nichols. After landing on the Moon, the pair discover a civilization of [[toplessness|topless]] [[extraterrestrials]] led by a Moon Queen with [[telepathic]] powers. Enamored of Dr. Huntley, the Moon Queen allows the men to take photos of the nudists during their everyday activities. Their oxygen running low, the two are forced to return to Earth, realizing in the process that they've left their camera behind and have no proof of the aliens' existence. Jeff is dispirited to learn that nobody believes their trip succeeded, but his spirits are lifted when he sees the resemblance between Dr. Nichols's secretary, Cathy, and the Moon Queen. The movie ends as the two embrace, signaling the beginning of a new romance.\n\n==Soundtrack==\n\n''Nude on the Moon'' features the original song \"I'm Mooning Over You (My Little Moon Doll)\" sung by [[Ralph Young (singer)|Ralph Young]] (who also plays a principal role in Wishman's ''[[Blaze Starr Goes Nudist]]'' under the pseudonym \"Russ Martine\"). Young would soon meet Belgian singer [[Tony Sandler]] and form [[Sandler and Young]], a successful easy-listening duo, with him. The lyrics and melody were written by Wishman's niece, Judith Kushner.

[[Real estate]] [[speculator]]s from New York started the community in 1854, the same year that the [[New York and Flushing Railroad]] began service to the area largely to serve a newly opened race course.  It was at the Fashion Race Course in 1858 that the first games of [[baseball]] to charge admission took place. The games, which took place between the All Stars of [[Brooklyn]] and the All Stars of [[Manhattan|New York]], are commonly believed to be the first all star baseball games and in essence the birthplace of professional baseball.

In the last half of the 20th century, Corona saw dramatic [[ethnic succession]]s. In the 1950s, what was predominantly an Italian American and African American neighborhood began to give way to an influx of [[Dominican American|Dominicans]]. In the late 1990s, Corona saw a new wave of [[immigration|immigrants]] from [[Latin America]]. The area north of Roosevelt Avenue contained the heart of the historic African American community. The intersection of 108th Street and Corona Avenue is the historic center of the Italian American community, sometimes referred to as Corona Heights. The majority Hispanic community now consists of Dominicans, [[Colombian American|Colombians]], [[Ecuadorian American|Ecuadorians]], [[Salvadoran American|Salvadorans]], [[Guatemalan American|Guatemalans]], [[Bolivian American|Bolivians]], [[Peruvian American|Peruvians]], [[Mexican people|Mexicans]], [[Venezuelan American|Venezuelans]], and [[Chilean American|Chileans]].

In the latter half of the 20th century, the area that is now Corona Plaza was a lot that connected the street to a row of mainly immigrant-owned businesses. The neighborhood of Corona had an overflow of immigrants who struggled to find employment which exacerbated illegal trading, much of which would occur through the use of trucks that could park in this unofficial lot. By the early 21st century, Corona Plaza was gradually given more attention and became a [[Community centre|community space]] for the ethnically diverse population of Corona.<ref name=\"ScienceDirect\">{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877916617300425|title=Re-envisioning community spaces in Corona, Queens, New York City|last1=Taylor|first1=Johanna K.|website=Science Direct|publisher=ELSEVIER|accessdate=4 November 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn 2005, the nearby [[Queens Museum]] began applying for permits to temporarily close off the streets that allowed vehicle access to the plaza and hosted public events (typically art based) that the residents of the community could attend.<ref name=\"queensmuseum\">{{cite web |title=Corona Plaza |url=https://queensmuseum.org/corona-plaza |website=Queensmuseum |publisher=Queens Museum |accessdate=4 November 2019}}</ref> Seeing the lot's future potential, the Queens Museum partnered with the [[New York City Economic Development Corporation|Queens Economic Development Corporation]] (QEDC) to develop plans to reuse the space.<ref name=\"ScienceDirect\" /> The partners saw this as an opportunity for grassroots, art-led engagement that would unite residents. The two groups' individual intentions both contributed to the creation of the permanent plaza: the QEDC supports developing local businesses while the Queens Museum creates a stronger presence in the neighborhood for its arts programs,<ref name=\"ScienceDirect\" />\n\nThe space was first transformed in 2012 as a temporary plaza with chairs and tables that prohibited through traffic. It was later made permanent by the [[New York City Department of Design and Construction|Department of Design and Construction]], which filled in the lot with concrete, added built-in seating and a performance space, new pedestrian lighting, and plants to reinforce the liveliness.

Originally serialized in ''[[Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump]]'' from 1987 to 2004, it was transferred to the monthly [[seinen|''seinen'' manga]] magazine ''[[Ultra Jump]]'' in 2005. The plot of the series is divided into eight [[Story arc|story arcs]], each following the adventures of a new protagonist bearing the \"JoJo\" nickname; the eighth part, ''[[JoJolion]]'', began its ongoing serialization in May 2011. The series is currently [[Shueisha]]'s second [[List of manga series by volume count|largest manga series by volume count]], with its chapters collected in 127 ''[[tank\u014dbon]]'' volumes as of April 2020.\n\nA [[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure (1993 anime series)|13-episode original video animation series]] adapting the manga's third part, ''[[Stardust Crusaders]]'', was produced by [[A.P.P.P.]] and released between 1993 and 2002.{{efn|Seven episodes adapting the latter half of the part were released between 1993 and 1994; six more episodes adapting the first half were released between 2000 and 2002.}} The studio later produced [[Phantom Blood#Release and related media|an anime film]] adaptation of the first part in the series, ''[[Phantom Blood]]'', which was released in Japanese theaters in 2007. In October 2012, an [[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure (2012 TV series)|anime television series adaptation]] produced by [[David Production]] began broadcast on [[Tokyo MX]]. The studio has since adapted through the series' fifth part, ''[[Golden Wind (manga)|Golden Wind]]'', which ended broadcast in July 2019. A [[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Diamond Is Unbreakable Chapter I|live-action film]] directed by [[Takashi Miike]] and based on the fourth part, ''[[Diamond is Unbreakable]]'', entered theaters in 2017.\n\n''JoJo's Bizarre Adventure'' is famous for its iconic art style and poses, frequent references to Western [[popular music]] and [[fashion]], and creative battles centered around [[#Supernatural powers|Stands]], psycho-spiritual manifestations possessing unique supernatural abilities. The series has sold over 100 million copies in print to date, making it one of the [[List of best-selling manga|best-selling manga series]] in history, and it has spawned a [[media franchise]] including [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot manga]], spin-off [[light novel]]s, [[List of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure video games|video games]], [[model figure|action figures]], and lines of apparel. The manga, TV anime, and live-action film are licensed in North America by [[Viz Media]], which has produced various English-language releases of the series since 2005.\n\n==Plot==\n{{See also|List of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure characters}}\nEach of the series' eight protagonists is a member of the {{Nihongo|Joestar family|\u30b8\u30e7\u30fc\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u5bb6|J\u014dsut\u0101 ke}}, whose mainline descendants invariably possess a star-shaped birthmark above their left shoulder blade and a name that can be abbreviated to the titular \"JoJo\". The plot of each part generally consists of this JoJo gathering a group of allies, mastering their supernatural ability, battling various enemies, and ultimately confronting the part's powerful main villain. The first six parts of the series take place within a single continuity whose multi-generational conflict stems from the rivalry between [[Jonathan Joestar]] and [[Dio Brando]], while the latter two parts take place in an alternate universe following a continuity reboot, where the Joestar family tree is heavily altered.\n\n; Part 1<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Phantom Blood]]''|\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u30c8\u30e0\u30d6\u30e9\u30c3\u30c9|Fantomu Buraddo}}\n:Volumes 1\u20135, 44 chapters. In late 19th-century [[England]], the young Jonathan Joestar meets his new adopted brother [[Dio Brando]], who only wants to usurp Jonathan as heir to the Joestar family. However, his attempts are thwarted and he resorts to using an ancient Stone Mask which transforms him into a [[vampire]]. Jonathan, with Italian [[#Supernatural powers|Hamon]] master Will A. Zeppeli and former street thug Robert E.O. Speedwagon at his side, uses his newly found affinity for Hamon to stop Dio whose sights are set on nothing less than world domination. With this Hamon, Jonathan has discovered the only power that can kill a Vampire, and thus is especially necessary in his rivalry against Dio, who has tormented him his whole life.\n\n; Part 2<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Battle Tendency]]''|\u6226\u95d8\u6f6e\u6d41|Sent\u014d Ch\u014dry\u016b}}\n:Volumes 5\u201312, 69 chapters. In [[New York City]] in 1938, Joseph Joestar, grandson of Jonathan, has a natural affinity for Hamon. After hearing of Speedwagon's supposed death during an excavation, Joseph decides to investigate and becomes entangled with the revival of the Pillar Men, ancient [[Humanoid|humanoids]] of impossible power who are tied to the creation of the Stone Mask. Joseph ultimately teams up with Caesar Zeppeli, Will's grandson, and Caesar's teacher Lisa Lisa, who is mysteriously tied to Joseph. Under the pressure of poisons implanted in Joseph's body, Joseph must master Hamon as they try to stop the Pillar Men from obtaining the Red Stone of Aja, a mystical artifact in Lisa Lisa's possession that will grant them immortality and bring about the end of the world at their hands.\n\n; Part 3<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Stardust Crusaders]]''|\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30c0\u30b9\u30c8\u30af\u30eb\u30bb\u30a4\u30c0\u30fc\u30b9|Sut\u0101dasuto Kuruseid\u0101su}}\n:Volumes 13\u201328, 152 chapters. In 1989, Jotaro Kujo, a Japanese high school student, places himself in jail because he believes he is possessed by an evil spirit. His mother Holly calls on her father Joseph Joestar to talk sense into Jotaro. With the help of his ally the Egyptian fortune teller Mohammed Avdol, Joseph reveals that Jotaro has in fact developed a supernatural ability known as a [[#Supernatural powers|Stand]] that has run through the family due to a newly resurfaced Dio Brando having fused his head to Jonathan Joestar's headless body. After thwarting an assassination attempt by transfer student Noriaki Kakyoin, who is under Dio's thrall, Jotaro and Joseph discover that Holly is dying from her own Stand. Jotaro resolves to hunt down Dio, and Joseph leads him, Avdol, and Kakyoin to Egypt, using their Stands to battle more Stand-wielding assassins along the way before 50 days elapse and Holly dies. As they progress, they gain allies in the French swordsman Jean Pierre Polnareff, who wishes to avenge the death of his sister, and the [[Boston Terrier]] Iggy, who begrudgingly accompanies the group on the way to [[Cairo]] to bring about the demise of Dio that was due one hundred years prior.\n\n; Part 4<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Diamond Is Unbreakable]]''|\u30c0\u30a4\u30e4\u30e2\u30f3\u30c9\u306f\u7815\u3051\u306a\u3044|Daiyamondo wa Kudakenai}}\n:Volumes 29\u201347, 174 chapters. In the fictional Japanese town of Morioh in 1999, Jotaro arrives to tell Josuke Higashikata (the kanji {{lang|ja|\u52a9}} in his name is read in the ''[[on'yomi]]'' form as ''jo'') that he is the illegitimate son of Joseph Joestar and to warn him that Morioh is becoming filled with Stand users. This is due to a mystical Bow and Arrow that bestows Stands on those struck by the arrowheads. After Josuke takes revenge on a Stand user who killed his grandfather, he agrees to help Jotaro hunt down the holder of the Bow and Arrow, Akira Otoishi. He gains allies in Josuke's friend Koichi Hirose, who is hit by the arrow; Okuyasu Nijimura, whose brother Keicho was using the Arrow until it was stolen from him; Rohan Kishibe, a famous manga artist; and even his estranged father Joseph Joestar. Along the way, the group deals with the various new Stand users throughout Morioh, including several of Josuke, Koichi, and Okuyasu's classmates. Eventually, the death of one of their friends leads to the discovery that one of the new Stand users is the [[serial killer]], Yoshikage Kira.\n\n; Part 5<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Golden Wind (manga)|Golden Wind]]''|\u9ec4\u91d1\u306e\u98a8|\u014cgon no Kaze}}\n:Volumes 47\u201363, 155 chapters. In 2001, Koichi Hirose is sent by Jotaro to [[Naples]] to investigate Giorno Giovanna, whom Jotaro has discovered is Dio's son fathered via Jonathan's body before his defeat in Cairo 12 years earlier, to see if the boy has a Stand and if he is evil. Koichi ultimately discovers Giorno's Stand and his pure goals for reforming a [[mafia]] organization from the inside out, and Jotaro lets him live his life uninterrupted. Giorno ultimately joins Bruno Bucciarati's squad within Passione, a Stand-using mafia, who leads Giorno, Leone Abbacchio, Guido Mista, Narancia Ghirga, and Pannacotta Fugo on a mission to [[Capri]] to retrieve Bruno's former superior's riches. In addition to being attacked by rival mafioso along the way, they are then tasked by Passione's boss to escort his daughter Trish Una throughout Italy and protect her from others in the gang who wish to use her to find out the boss's identity.\n\n; Part 6<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Stone Ocean]]''|\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30f3\u30aa\u30fc\u30b7\u30e3\u30f3|Sut\u014dn \u014cshan}}\n:Volumes 64\u201380, 158 chapters. In 2011 near [[Port St. Lucie, Florida]], Jolyne Cujoh is arrested and sent to the Green Dolphin St. Prison for murder. Her estranged father Jotaro visits her and reveals that she has been set up in order for one of Dio's disciples to kill her within the prison. After revealing that a gift he gave her has awoken her latent Stand powers to protect her, Jotaro is attacked, and his Stand and memories are stolen from him by the prison chaplain Enrico Pucci, Dio's disciple. Jolyne works with fellow inmate Ermes Costello, who has also had a Stand awoken in her, to retrieve her father's Stand, gaining allies in the boy Emporio Alni\u00f1o; fellow inmates Narciso Anasui and Weather Report; and the sentient Stand-using plankton colony \u201cFoo Fighters\u201d to save her father and stop Pucci before he can use his Stand to recreate the universe in Dio's image.\n\n; Part 7<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Steel Ball Run]]''|\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30fc\u30eb\u30fb\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb\u30fb\u30e9\u30f3|Sut\u012bru B\u014dru Ran}}\n:Volumes 81\u2013104, 95 chapters. In an alternate timeline in 1890, Gyro Zeppeli travels to the United States to take part in a cross-country horse race known as the Steel Ball Run. His skill in a mystical martial art known as Spin, which he controls with steel balls, garners the interest of former jockey turned paraplegic Johnny Joestar, particularly after a Spin-infused ball briefly restores Johnny's ability to walk. Johnny travels with Gyro on the race to learn the art of Spin from him in hopes he can walk again, but they soon discover that the race is a ploy set up by Funny Valentine, the President of the United States, to search the country for the scattered parts of a holy corpse that imbue their holders with a Stand, so the President can use the entire corpse to his own patriotic ends, even if it means the disruption of other dimensions with his Stand's ability. Gyro and Johnny work together, along with fellow racers Mountain Tim and Hot Pants, and race organizer Stephen Steel and his wife Lucy, to stop the President from achieving his plans, as they threaten the very world, all while dealing with Valentine's hired assassins in the race, including the charismatic racer Diego Brando.\n\n; Part 8<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[JoJolion]]''|\u30b8\u30e7\u30b8\u30e7\u30ea\u30aa\u30f3|Jojorion}}\n:Volumes 105\u2013126, 93 chapters. In 2012, in the same universe as ''Steel Ball Run'', the town of Morioh has been devastated by the [[2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami]], which has caused mysterious faults colloquially known as the \"Wall Eyes\" to appear in town. Local college student Yasuho Hirose is near one of the Wall Eyes when she discovers a young man buried in the rubble and a strange bite mark on him. She nicknames him \"Josuke\", as he cannot remember his own name, and after following a lead that he may be \"Yoshikage Kira\", an attack by a Stand user leads them to find the real Yoshikage Kira's corpse. Josuke is put in the care of the Higashikata family, whose patriarch Norisuke IV seems to know more about Josuke than he initially lets on, but Josuke himself discovers that the Higashikata family and Yoshikage Kira's family are linked due to Johnny Joestar's marriage to Rina Higashikata in the late 19th century. Josuke and Yasuho ultimately discover that Josuke is in fact Yoshikage Kira, mysteriously fused with another person, and Yoshikage Kira possessed the knowledge to cure a curse that has plagued the Higashikata family for centuries. Norisuke IV wants that knowledge back to save his grandchild from the same fate he and his family has suffered, but a mysterious race of rock men and Norisuke IV's own son Jobin seem to be conspiring against them to both prevent Josuke from regaining his memories and from lifting the curse on the Higashikata family.\n\n==Supernatural powers==\n{{more citations needed section|date=May 2017}}\n* {{anchor|Hamon}} '''Part 1:''' ''[[Phantom Blood]]'' introduces the {{nihongo|Stone Mask|\u77f3\u4eee\u9762|Ishikamen}}, an artifact discovered in Aztec ruins that reacts when blood is spilled on it, the Stone Mask produces spikes that drive themselves into the wearer's skull, transforming them into an immortal {{nihongo|[[Vampire]]|\u5438\u8840\u9b3c|Ky\u016bketsuki}}. These Vampires drain people of blood, can heal from most injuries, combine other creatures into abominations and freeze objects. A Vampire can only be killed by destroying the head, or by exposure to natural sunlight or ultraviolet rays. The {{nihongo|Ripple|\u6ce2\u7d0b|Hamon}} is also introduced as a martial arts technique that allows the user to focus bodily energy via controlled breathing. It is effective in combating vampires, as experienced Ripple users can emulate sunlight. Such energy is also useful in combating {{nihongo|Zombies|{{ruby-ja|\u5c4d\u751f\u4eba|\u30be\u30f3\u30d3}}|Zonbi|also referred to as {{nihongo|\"Undead\"|{{ruby-ja|\u4ea1\u8005|\u30a2\u30f3\u30c7\u30c3\u30c9}}|Andeddo}}}} created by vampires.\n* '''Part 2:''' ''[[Battle Tendency]]'' introduces the {{nihongo|Pillar Men|\u67f1\u306e\u7537|Hashira no Otoko}}, ancient humanoids whose superhuman abilities enabled them to thrive as apex predators. One of their members, Kars, created the Stone Masks in an attempt to find a way to bypass their species' weakness to sunlight so they may rule Earth. When they are exposed to sunlight, they turn to stone, thus making them susceptible to the energies of the Ripple. Their surviving members seek out the {{nihongo|Red Stone of Aja|\u30a8\u30a4\u30b8\u30e3\u306e\u8d64\u77f3|Eija no Sekiseki}}, a flawless gem that amplifies light into nearly laser precision which is able to perfect the transformation into an immortal being with control over all life's forces. It is for this reason that the Ripple users protect the flawless Super Aja so it will not fall into the hands of the Pillar Men.\n* {{anchor|Stands}} '''Part 3:''' ''[[Stardust Crusaders]]'' introduces an evolution of the Ripple concept, {{nihongo|Stands|{{ruby-ja|\u5e7d\u6ce2\u7d0b|\u3086\u3046\u306f\u3082\u3093}}|Y\u016bhamon|literally \"Ghost (or Spirit) Ripple\", pronounced in the series as the English {{nihongo|\"Stand\"|\u30b9\u30bf\u30f3\u30c9|Sutando}}}}, so named because they are the manifestation of the user's psychic powers, or what would be their Ripple, in the form of a spiritual familiar that stands with them. A person may obtain a Stand naturally at birth, through rigorous spiritual and/or Ripple training, through exceptionally strong willpower, desire and/or passion, or through inheritance from bloodline. A Stand may never manifest itself until it is amplified by certain conditions or factors and not everyone has the ability to control it. Some Stands appear to have a separate and autonomous personality from their users, able to act on their own to protect them or speak to them. Generally, if the Stand user is incapacitated, the Stand will no longer be a threat (with an exception in Part 5), and any damage to a stand will be reflected on its user, and vice versa.\n* '''Part 4:''' ''[[Diamond Is Unbreakable]]'' introduces a {{nihongo|Bow and Arrow|\u5f13\u3068\u77e2|Yumi to Ya}}, forged from a mysterious meteorite that made its way to Earth after being drawn in by the spiritual powers of the planet's inhabitants. A Stand can be brought forth after one is pierced by the Arrow; however, the results can be unpredictable, as it could easily kill an unqualified person, and there is no apparent way to know if a person is qualified ahead of time. The Arrows do, however, tend to seek out qualified people on their own if there is someone to guide them.\n* '''Part 5:''' ''[[Golden Wind (manga)|Golden Wind]]'' introduces the ability to create a {{nihongo|\"Requiem\"|{{ruby-ja|\u93ae\u9b42\u6b4c|\u30ec\u30af\u30a4\u30a8\u30e0}}|Rekuiemu}} Stand. If an Arrow hits the Stand instead of the user, the Stand can completely change form and its powers become a Requiem Stand with increased powers that relate to the control over the souls of living beings. Both Giorno's Gold Experience and Polnareff's Silver Chariot are pierced by the Arrow and given Requiem forms. Silver Chariot Requiem's new ability swaps the souls of all living beings, and Gold Experience Requiem's new ability removes the consequences of any action, reverting it to a null state.\n* '''Part 6:''' ''[[Stone Ocean]]'' shows examples of a single person possessing two Stands because of the ability of an extraordinary Stand. Enrico Pucci is able to produce artificial Stand users by stealing others' Stands, transforming them into {{nihongo|Discs|\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30af|Disuku}}, and \"inserting\" them into certain individuals. Part 6 also features {{nihongo|DIO's bone|{{ruby-ja|DIO|\u30c7\u30a3\u30aa}}\u306e\u9aa8|DIO no Hone}}, the sole remaining part of DIO which is instrumental in Pucci's {{nihongo|Way to Heaven|\u5929\u56fd\u3078\u884c\u304f\u65b9\u6cd5|Tengoku e Iku H\u014dh\u014d}}.

Also introduced in Part 7 is the {{nihongo|Saint's Corpse|\u8056\u4eba\u306e\u907a\u4f53|Seijin no Itai}}, body parts of a deceased holy man (hinted to be [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]]) that imbue the user with a Stand if the body part is fused with the user. If the user loses the Corpse part, they lose their Stand.\n* '''Part 8:''' ''[[JoJolion]]'' introduces another method of obtaining a Stand, interaction with the {{nihongo|Wall Eyes|\u58c1\u306e\u76ee|Kabe no Me}}, strange [[fault (geology)|fault]]-like structures that have risen from the ground following the [[2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami]]. They disrupt all forms of transportation, communication, and utilities, but all users of Stands have come in contact with the Wall Eyes at some point. A race of Stand-using {{nihongo|Rock People|\u5ca9\u4eba\u9593|Iwa Ningen}} also appears in ''JoJolion''. These humans seem to innately possess the ability to turn their body into stone and enter a state of suspended animation.

Originally serialized in ''[[Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump]]'' from 1987 to 2004, it was transferred to the monthly [[seinen|''seinen'' manga]] magazine ''[[Ultra Jump]]'' in 2005. The plot of the series is divided into eight [[Story arc|story arcs]], each following the adventures of a new protagonist bearing the \"JoJo\" nickname; the eighth part, ''[[JoJolion]]'', began its ongoing serialization in May 2011. The series is currently [[Shueisha]]'s second [[List of manga series by volume count|largest manga series by volume count]], with its chapters collected in 127 ''[[tank\u014dbon]]'' volumes as of April 2020.\n\nA [[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure (1993 anime series)|13-episode original video animation series]] adapting the manga's third part, ''[[Stardust Crusaders]]'', was produced by [[A.P.P.P.]] and released between 1993 and 2002.{{efn|Seven episodes adapting the latter half of the part were released between 1993 and 1994; six more episodes adapting the first half were released between 2000 and 2002.}} The studio later produced [[Phantom Blood#Release and related media|an anime film]] adaptation of the first part in the series, ''[[Phantom Blood]]'', which was released in Japanese theaters in 2007. In October 2012, an [[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure (2012 TV series)|anime television series adaptation]] produced by [[David Production]] began broadcast on [[Tokyo MX]]. The studio has since adapted through the series' fifth part, ''[[Golden Wind (manga)|Golden Wind]]'', which ended broadcast in July 2019. A [[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Diamond Is Unbreakable Chapter I|live-action film]] directed by [[Takashi Miike]] and based on the fourth part, ''[[Diamond is Unbreakable]]'', entered theaters in 2017.\n\n''JoJo's Bizarre Adventure'' is famous for its iconic art style and poses, frequent references to Western [[popular music]] and [[fashion]], and creative battles centered around [[#Supernatural powers|Stands]], psycho-spiritual manifestations possessing unique supernatural abilities. The series has sold over 100 million copies in print to date, making it one of the [[List of best-selling manga|best-selling manga series]] in history, and it has spawned a [[media franchise]] including [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot manga]], spin-off [[light novel]]s, [[List of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure video games|video games]], [[model figure|action figures]], and lines of apparel. The manga, TV anime, and live-action film are licensed in North America by [[Viz Media]], which has produced various English-language releases of the series since 2005.\n\n==Plot==\n{{See also|List of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure characters}}\nEach of the series' eight protagonists is a member of the {{Nihongo|Joestar family|\u30b8\u30e7\u30fc\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u5bb6|J\u014dsut\u0101 ke}}, whose mainline descendants invariably possess a star-shaped birthmark above their left shoulder blade and a name that can be abbreviated to the titular \"JoJo\". The plot of each part generally consists of this JoJo gathering a group of allies, mastering their supernatural ability, battling various enemies, and ultimately confronting the part's powerful main villain. The first six parts of the series take place within a single continuity whose multi-generational conflict stems from the rivalry between [[Jonathan Joestar]] and [[Dio Brando]], while the latter two parts take place in an alternate universe following a continuity reboot, where the Joestar family tree is heavily altered.\n\n; Part 1<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Phantom Blood]]''|\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u30c8\u30e0\u30d6\u30e9\u30c3\u30c9|Fantomu Buraddo}}\n:Volumes 1\u20135, 44 chapters. In late 19th-century [[England]], the young Jonathan Joestar meets his new adopted brother [[Dio Brando]], who only wants to usurp Jonathan as heir to the Joestar family. However, his attempts are thwarted and he resorts to using an ancient Stone Mask which transforms him into a [[vampire]]. Jonathan, with Italian [[#Supernatural powers|Hamon]] master Will A. Zeppeli and former street thug Robert E.O. Speedwagon at his side, uses his newly found affinity for Hamon to stop Dio whose sights are set on nothing less than world domination. With this Hamon, Jonathan has discovered the only power that can kill a Vampire, and thus is especially necessary in his rivalry against Dio, who has tormented him his whole life.\n\n; Part 2<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Battle Tendency]]''|\u6226\u95d8\u6f6e\u6d41|Sent\u014d Ch\u014dry\u016b}}\n:Volumes 5\u201312, 69 chapters. In [[New York City]] in 1938, Joseph Joestar, grandson of Jonathan, has a natural affinity for Hamon. After hearing of Speedwagon's supposed death during an excavation, Joseph decides to investigate and becomes entangled with the revival of the Pillar Men, ancient [[Humanoid|humanoids]] of impossible power who are tied to the creation of the Stone Mask. Joseph ultimately teams up with Caesar Zeppeli, Will's grandson, and Caesar's teacher Lisa Lisa, who is mysteriously tied to Joseph. Under the pressure of poisons implanted in Joseph's body, Joseph must master Hamon as they try to stop the Pillar Men from obtaining the Red Stone of Aja, a mystical artifact in Lisa Lisa's possession that will grant them immortality and bring about the end of the world at their hands.\n\n; Part 3<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Stardust Crusaders]]''|\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30c0\u30b9\u30c8\u30af\u30eb\u30bb\u30a4\u30c0\u30fc\u30b9|Sut\u0101dasuto Kuruseid\u0101su}}\n:Volumes 13\u201328, 152 chapters. In 1989, Jotaro Kujo, a Japanese high school student, places himself in jail because he believes he is possessed by an evil spirit. His mother Holly calls on her father Joseph Joestar to talk sense into Jotaro. With the help of his ally the Egyptian fortune teller Mohammed Avdol, Joseph reveals that Jotaro has in fact developed a supernatural ability known as a [[#Supernatural powers|Stand]] that has run through the family due to a newly resurfaced Dio Brando having fused his head to Jonathan Joestar's headless body. After thwarting an assassination attempt by transfer student Noriaki Kakyoin, who is under Dio's thrall, Jotaro and Joseph discover that Holly is dying from her own Stand. Jotaro resolves to hunt down Dio, and Joseph leads him, Avdol, and Kakyoin to Egypt, using their Stands to battle more Stand-wielding assassins along the way before 50 days elapse and Holly dies. As they progress, they gain allies in the French swordsman Jean Pierre Polnareff, who wishes to avenge the death of his sister, and the [[Boston Terrier]] Iggy, who begrudgingly accompanies the group on the way to [[Cairo]] to bring about the demise of Dio that was due one hundred years prior.\n\n; Part 4<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Diamond Is Unbreakable]]''|\u30c0\u30a4\u30e4\u30e2\u30f3\u30c9\u306f\u7815\u3051\u306a\u3044|Daiyamondo wa Kudakenai}}\n:Volumes 29\u201347, 174 chapters. In the fictional Japanese town of Morioh in 1999, Jotaro arrives to tell Josuke Higashikata (the kanji {{lang|ja|\u52a9}} in his name is read in the ''[[on'yomi]]'' form as ''jo'') that he is the illegitimate son of Joseph Joestar and to warn him that Morioh is becoming filled with Stand users. This is due to a mystical Bow and Arrow that bestows Stands on those struck by the arrowheads. After Josuke takes revenge on a Stand user who killed his grandfather, he agrees to help Jotaro hunt down the holder of the Bow and Arrow, Akira Otoishi. He gains allies in Josuke's friend Koichi Hirose, who is hit by the arrow; Okuyasu Nijimura, whose brother Keicho was using the Arrow until it was stolen from him; Rohan Kishibe, a famous manga artist; and even his estranged father Joseph Joestar. Along the way, the group deals with the various new Stand users throughout Morioh, including several of Josuke, Koichi, and Okuyasu's classmates. Eventually, the death of one of their friends leads to the discovery that one of the new Stand users is the [[serial killer]], Yoshikage Kira.\n\n; Part 5<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Golden Wind (manga)|Golden Wind]]''|\u9ec4\u91d1\u306e\u98a8|\u014cgon no Kaze}}\n:Volumes 47\u201363, 155 chapters. In 2001, Koichi Hirose is sent by Jotaro to [[Naples]] to investigate Giorno Giovanna, whom Jotaro has discovered is Dio's son fathered via Jonathan's body before his defeat in Cairo 12 years earlier, to see if the boy has a Stand and if he is evil. Koichi ultimately discovers Giorno's Stand and his pure goals for reforming a mafia organization from the inside out, and Jotaro lets him live his life uninterrupted. Giorno ultimately joins Bruno Bucciarati's squad within Passione, a Stand-using mafia, who leads Giorno, Leone Abbacchio, Guido Mista, Narancia Ghirga, and Pannacotta Fugo on a mission to [[Capri]] to retrieve Bruno's former superior's riches. In addition to being attacked by rival mafioso along the way, they are then tasked by Passione's boss to escort his daughter Trish Una throughout Italy and protect her from others in the gang who wish to use her to find out the boss's identity.\n\n; Part 6<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Stone Ocean]]''|\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30f3\u30aa\u30fc\u30b7\u30e3\u30f3|Sut\u014dn \u014cshan}}\n:Volumes 64\u201380, 158 chapters.

Her estranged father Jotaro visits her and reveals that she has been set up in order for one of Dio's disciples to kill her within the prison. After revealing that a gift he gave her has awoken her latent Stand powers to protect her, Jotaro is attacked, and his Stand and memories are stolen from him by the prison chaplain Enrico Pucci, Dio's disciple. Jolyne works with fellow inmate Ermes Costello, who has also had a Stand awoken in her, to retrieve her father's Stand, gaining allies in the boy Emporio Alni\u00f1o; fellow inmates Narciso Anasui and Weather Report; and the sentient Stand-using plankton colony \u201cFoo Fighters\u201d to save her father and stop Pucci before he can use his Stand to recreate the universe in Dio's image.\n\n; Part 7<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Steel Ball Run]]''|\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30fc\u30eb\u30fb\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb\u30fb\u30e9\u30f3|Sut\u012bru B\u014dru Ran}}\n:Volumes 81\u2013104, 95 chapters. In an alternate timeline in 1890, Gyro Zeppeli travels to the United States to take part in a cross-country horse race known as the Steel Ball Run. His skill in a mystical martial art known as Spin, which he controls with steel balls, garners the interest of former jockey turned paraplegic Johnny Joestar, particularly after a Spin-infused ball briefly restores Johnny's ability to walk. Johnny travels with Gyro on the race to learn the art of Spin from him in hopes he can walk again, but they soon discover that the race is a ploy set up by Funny Valentine, the President of the United States, to search the country for the scattered parts of a holy corpse that imbue their holders with a Stand, so the President can use the entire corpse to his own patriotic ends, even if it means the disruption of other dimensions with his Stand's ability. Gyro and Johnny work together, along with fellow racers Mountain Tim and Hot Pants, and race organizer Stephen Steel and his wife Lucy, to stop the President from achieving his plans, as they threaten the very world, all while dealing with Valentine's hired assassins in the race, including the charismatic racer Diego Brando.\n\n; Part 8<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[JoJolion]]''|\u30b8\u30e7\u30b8\u30e7\u30ea\u30aa\u30f3|Jojorion}}\n:Volumes 105\u2013126, 93 chapters. In 2012, in the same universe as ''Steel Ball Run'', the town of Morioh has been devastated by the [[2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami]], which has caused mysterious faults colloquially known as the \"Wall Eyes\" to appear in town. Local college student Yasuho Hirose is near one of the Wall Eyes when she discovers a young man buried in the rubble and a strange bite mark on him. She nicknames him \"Josuke\", as he cannot remember his own name, and after following a lead that he may be \"Yoshikage Kira\", an attack by a Stand user leads them to find the real Yoshikage Kira's corpse. Josuke is put in the care of the Higashikata family, whose patriarch Norisuke IV seems to know more about Josuke than he initially lets on, but Josuke himself discovers that the Higashikata family and Yoshikage Kira's family are linked due to Johnny Joestar's marriage to Rina Higashikata in the late 19th century. Josuke and Yasuho ultimately discover that Josuke is in fact Yoshikage Kira, mysteriously fused with another person, and Yoshikage Kira possessed the knowledge to cure a curse that has plagued the Higashikata family for centuries. Norisuke IV wants that knowledge back to save his grandchild from the same fate he and his family has suffered, but a mysterious race of rock men and Norisuke IV's own son Jobin seem to be conspiring against them to both prevent Josuke from regaining his memories and from lifting the curse on the Higashikata family.\n\n==Supernatural powers==\n{{more citations needed section|date=May 2017}}\n* {{anchor|Hamon}} '''Part 1:''' ''[[Phantom Blood]]'' introduces the {{nihongo|Stone Mask|\u77f3\u4eee\u9762|Ishikamen}}, an artifact discovered in Aztec ruins that reacts when blood is spilled on it, the Stone Mask produces spikes that drive themselves into the wearer's skull, transforming them into an immortal {{nihongo|[[Vampire]]|\u5438\u8840\u9b3c|Ky\u016bketsuki}}. These Vampires drain people of blood, can heal from most injuries, combine other creatures into abominations and freeze objects. A Vampire can only be killed by destroying the head, or by exposure to natural sunlight or ultraviolet rays. The {{nihongo|Ripple|\u6ce2\u7d0b|Hamon}} is also introduced as a martial arts technique that allows the user to focus bodily energy via controlled breathing. It is effective in combating vampires, as experienced Ripple users can emulate sunlight. Such energy is also useful in combating {{nihongo|Zombies|{{ruby-ja|\u5c4d\u751f\u4eba|\u30be\u30f3\u30d3}}|Zonbi|also referred to as {{nihongo|\"Undead\"|{{ruby-ja|\u4ea1\u8005|\u30a2\u30f3\u30c7\u30c3\u30c9}}|Andeddo}}}} created by vampires.\n* '''Part 2:''' ''[[Battle Tendency]]'' introduces the {{nihongo|Pillar Men|\u67f1\u306e\u7537|Hashira no Otoko}}, ancient humanoids whose superhuman abilities enabled them to thrive as apex predators. One of their members, Kars, created the Stone Masks in an attempt to find a way to bypass their species' weakness to sunlight so they may rule Earth. When they are exposed to sunlight, they turn to stone, thus making them susceptible to the energies of the Ripple. Their surviving members seek out the {{nihongo|Red Stone of Aja|\u30a8\u30a4\u30b8\u30e3\u306e\u8d64\u77f3|Eija no Sekiseki}}, a flawless gem that amplifies light into nearly laser precision which is able to perfect the transformation into an immortal being with control over all life's forces. It is for this reason that the Ripple users protect the flawless Super Aja so it will not fall into the hands of the Pillar Men.\n* {{anchor|Stands}} '''Part 3:''' ''[[Stardust Crusaders]]'' introduces an evolution of the Ripple concept, {{nihongo|Stands|{{ruby-ja|\u5e7d\u6ce2\u7d0b|\u3086\u3046\u306f\u3082\u3093}}|Y\u016bhamon|literally \"Ghost (or Spirit) Ripple\", pronounced in the series as the English {{nihongo|\"Stand\"|\u30b9\u30bf\u30f3\u30c9|Sutando}}}}, so named because they are the manifestation of the user's psychic powers, or what would be their Ripple, in the form of a spiritual familiar that stands with them. A person may obtain a Stand naturally at birth, through rigorous spiritual and/or Ripple training, through exceptionally strong willpower, desire and/or passion, or through inheritance from bloodline. A Stand may never manifest itself until it is amplified by certain conditions or factors and not everyone has the ability to control it. Some Stands appear to have a separate and autonomous personality from their users, able to act on their own to protect them or speak to them. Generally, if the Stand user is incapacitated, the Stand will no longer be a threat (with an exception in Part 5), and any damage to a stand will be reflected on its user, and vice versa.\n* '''Part 4:''' ''[[Diamond Is Unbreakable]]'' introduces a {{nihongo|Bow and Arrow|\u5f13\u3068\u77e2|Yumi to Ya}}, forged from a mysterious meteorite that made its way to Earth after being drawn in by the spiritual powers of the planet's inhabitants. A Stand can be brought forth after one is pierced by the Arrow; however, the results can be unpredictable, as it could easily kill an unqualified person, and there is no apparent way to know if a person is qualified ahead of time. The Arrows do, however, tend to seek out qualified people on their own if there is someone to guide them.\n* '''Part 5:''' ''[[Golden Wind (manga)|Golden Wind]]'' introduces the ability to create a {{nihongo|\"Requiem\"|{{ruby-ja|\u93ae\u9b42\u6b4c|\u30ec\u30af\u30a4\u30a8\u30e0}}|Rekuiemu}} Stand. If an Arrow hits the Stand instead of the user, the Stand can completely change form and its powers become a Requiem Stand with increased powers that relate to the control over the souls of living beings. Both Giorno's Gold Experience and Polnareff's Silver Chariot are pierced by the Arrow and given Requiem forms. Silver Chariot Requiem's new ability swaps the souls of all living beings, and Gold Experience Requiem's new ability removes the consequences of any action, reverting it to a null state.\n* '''Part 6:''' ''[[Stone Ocean]]'' shows examples of a single person possessing two Stands because of the ability of an extraordinary Stand. Enrico Pucci is able to produce artificial Stand users by stealing others' Stands, transforming them into {{nihongo|Discs|\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30af|Disuku}}, and \"inserting\" them into certain individuals. Part 6 also features {{nihongo|DIO's bone|{{ruby-ja|DIO|\u30c7\u30a3\u30aa}}\u306e\u9aa8|DIO no Hone}}, the sole remaining part of DIO which is instrumental in Pucci's {{nihongo|Way to Heaven|\u5929\u56fd\u3078\u884c\u304f\u65b9\u6cd5|Tengoku e Iku H\u014dh\u014d}}. It grants a new and more powerful Stand that ultimately leads to the creation of {{nihongo|Made in Heaven|\u30e1\u30a4\u30c9\u30fb\u30a4\u30f3\u30fb\u30d8\u30d6\u30f3|Meido In Hebun}}, a powerful Stand that can accelerate the universe to the point of a universal reset in accordance with the [[Big Bounce|Big Bounce cosmological model]].\n* '''Part 7:''' ''[[Steel Ball Run]]'' introduces the {{nihongo|Spin|\u56de\u8ee2|Kaiten}}, a technique that incorporates the [[Fibonacci number|Fibonacci sequence]], [[golden spiral]], and {{nihongo|[[golden rectangle]]|\u9ec4\u91d1\u9577\u65b9\u5f62|\u014dgon ch\u014dh\u014dkei}} into a means of manipulating the [[Magnus effect]] to the user's benefit, but its true power lies in its destructive effects. Also introduced in Part 7 is the {{nihongo|Saint's Corpse|\u8056\u4eba\u306e\u907a\u4f53|Seijin no Itai}}, body parts of a deceased holy man (hinted to be [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]]) that imbue the user with a Stand if the body part is fused with the user. If the user loses the Corpse part, they lose their Stand.\n* '''Part 8:''' ''[[JoJolion]]'' introduces another method of obtaining a Stand, interaction with the {{nihongo|Wall Eyes|\u58c1\u306e\u76ee|Kabe no Me}}, strange [[fault (geology)|fault]]-like structures that have risen from the ground following the [[2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami]]. They disrupt all forms of transportation, communication, and utilities, but all users of Stands have come in contact with the Wall Eyes at some point. A race of Stand-using {{nihongo|Rock People|\u5ca9\u4eba\u9593|Iwa Ningen}} also appears in ''JoJolion''. These humans seem to innately possess the ability to turn their body into stone and enter a state of suspended animation. Also introduced in Part 8 is the {{nihongo|Rokakaka|\u30ed\u30ab\u30ab\u30ab|Rokakaka}} fruit, which is able to \"fix\" a body part at the expense of taking another away.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Paul Gauguin 106.jpg|thumb|Araki is inspired by western art, such as this piece by [[Paul Gauguin]] which inspired him to use unusual colors in his own art.<ref name=\"comipress\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nhk.or.jp/kokokoza/tv/art/archive/chapter015.html |title=NHK\u9ad8\u6821\u8b1b\u5ea7 &#124; \u82b8\u8853\uff08\u7f8e\u8853\u2160\uff0f\u66f8\u9053\u2160\uff09 &#124; \u7b2c15\u56de \u7f8e\u8853(8) \u6f2b\u753b\u306f\u3084\u3063\u3071\u308a\u304a\u3082\u3057\u308d\u3044 \u301c\u4eba\u7269\u301c |publisher=Nhk.or.jp |date= |accessdate=August 3, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810200320/http://www.nhk.or.jp/kokokoza/tv/art/archive/chapter015.html |archivedate=August 10, 2014}}</ref>]]\nFor ''JoJo's Bizarre Adventure'', Araki wanted to use a classical method as a base and then introduce modern elements in the singular.

The orders have led to several legal challenges and criticism by human rights groups and several national medical organizations, including the [[American Medical Association]]. Legal challenges on behalf of abortion providers, many of which are represented by the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] and [[Planned Parenthood]], have successfully stopped most of the orders on a temporary basis. \n\n== Background ==\nDuring the [[2019-20 coronavirus pandemic in the United States]], many non-essential medical procedures were temporarily suspended to preserve medical resources like [[personal protective equipment]] (PPE). In the context of these orders, several [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] officials and anti-abortion advocates argued that [[abortion]] should be considered non-essential, leading to orders in multiple states explicitly prohibiting the procedure.\n\nSeveral medical organizations and human rights groups issued statements critical of the restrictions. The [[American Medical Association]] characterizing them as \"exploiting this moment to ban or dramatically limit women's reproductive health care.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2020/04/02/826369859/in-texas-oklahoma-women-turned-away-because-of-coronavirus-abortion-bans|title=In Texas, Oklahoma, Women Turned Away Because Of Coronavirus Abortion Bans|website=NPR.org|language=en|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ama-assn.org/press-center/ama-statements/ama-statement-government-interference-reproductive-health-care|title=AMA statement on government interference in reproductive health care|website=American Medical Association|language=en|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref> The [[American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists]], the [[American Board of Obstetrics and Gynecology]], the [[American Association of Gynecologic Laparoscopists]], the American Gynecological and Obstetrical Society, the [[American Society for Reproductive Medicine]], the Society for Academic Specialists in General Obstetrics and Gynecology, the Society of Family Planning, and the [[Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine]] issued a joint statement that \"abortion should not be categorized as [a procedure that can be delayed during the pandemic].

Most states have not recognised them as being Russian territory.\n\nThe administrative division in Ukraine was [[Administrative divisions of the Ukrainian SSR|directly inherited]] (grandfathered) from the [[Republics of the Soviet Union|local republican]] administration of the [[Soviet Union]], the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]], and has not changed significantly since the middle of the 20th century. It is somewhat complex, as beside having several levels of a territorial subdivision it also has a classification for various [[Populated places in Ukraine|populated places]], particularly [[Cities of Ukraine|cities]].\n\n==Overview==\n{{confusing|date=December 2014}}\n{{refimprove section|date=December 2014}}\n{{See also|Local government in Ukraine}}\n[[File:Administrative divisions of Ukraine improved.jpg|thumb|400px|Simple flow chart of administrative divisions of Ukraine]]\n\nAccording to the Article 133 of [[Constitution of Ukraine]], \"the system of the administrative and territorial structure of Ukraine is composed of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea, oblasts, districts, cities, districts in city, settlements, and villages.\" Note, that although certain types of subdivision are not mentioned in Constitution of Ukraine (i.e. rural settlements), they are mentioned for regional composition. Also, for disambiguation regular raions (districts) are sometimes denoted as rural to distinguish them from raions in city.<ref name=regions/>\n\nUkraine's administrative divisions are divided as follows:\n*By geographical characteristics the units are divided on regions (such as autonomous republic, oblasts, districts, cities with special status) and places of settlement (cities, towns, villages).\n*By their status they can be administrative-territorial units (oblasts and districts), self-governed territorial units (cities, towns, villages). Also the autonomous republic has a unique status of territorial autonomy, while districts in cities combine both characteristics of administrative territorial as well as self-governed territorial units.\n*By position in the system of administrative division of Ukraine, the units divided into territorial units of ''prime level'' (cities w/o district division, districts in cities, towns, villages), of ''middle level'' (districts, cities with district division), and of ''higher level'' (autonomous republic, oblasts, cities with special status).\n*Administrative division has changed because some territories are not under the control of the government. For example, Sievierodonetsk has become the new central regional center.\n\nRegions, cities, districts are governed by a state administration, a chief of which is appointed by the president after a nomination by the [[Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine|cabinet of ministers]].<ref>[http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/382028.html Poroshenko to sign Saakashvili\u2019s resignation if Cabinet submits motion], [[Interfax-Ukraine]] (7 November 2016)</ref> Crimea has its own cabinet of ministers, however the state administration is represented by the office of the Presidential Representative of Ukraine. A basic and the lowest level of administrative division is a settlement that is governed by a local council (rada). Cities as a settlement always carry a special status within a region and have their own form of self-administration (municipality \u2013 ''vykonkom'') and some may consist of their own city's districts (raions). City municipalities are governed by a mayor and a city council (miskrada). Some smaller cities, towns, and rural localities may be under control of city municipalities based on larger cities. Towns as well as villages are not controlled by state administration and are self-governed by either a town council (selyshchna rada) or a village council (silrada) within the limits of the Constitution and the laws of Ukraine (article 140 of the Constitution of Ukraine). Village councils may carry a combined jurisdiction which may include several villages and hamlets (selyshche). Unlike villages, each town council always has a separate jurisdiction which may be part of bigger city's council. Hamlet (selyshche) is a non-governed rural locality and is governed by a village council of nearby village.\n\n===Table===\nUkraine is divided into 3 main administrative divisions: [[oblast]] (region), [[raion]] (district), and council (city, settlement, and village). Note, settlements such as cities do not necessary constitute the basic level of the Ukrainian administrative territorial system. For that purpose cities are categorized into own three categories that correspond to each level of subdivisions. Cities with special status and regional significance beside being divided into special districts in city may also include smaller cities (district significance), settlements, and/or villages. Please, note that the settlement's population size is not the only factor for its status. The final decision on status change is carried out by the [[Ukrainian parliament]].

Excluded in the administrative changes was [[Western Ukraine]], which at that time formed part of the [[Second Polish Republic]] and shared in the Polish form of administrative division based on [[Voivodeships of Poland|voivodeships]].\n\nIn the post-[[World War II]] period, the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]] consisted of [[Administrative divisions of the Ukrainian SSR|25 oblasts and two cities with special status]].\n\nAfter the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, Crimea obtained the status of an autonomous republic with its own government instead of a regional state administration.\n\n==Regions==\n{{Ukraine Labelled Map|float=right}}\n\n===Autonomous republic===\n{{Main|Autonomous Republic of Crimea}}\n\nThe Autonomous Republic of Crimea, formerly the Crimean Oblast of the Ukrainian SSR, geographically encompasses the major portion of the Crimean peninsula in southern [[Ukraine]]. Its capital is [[Simferopol]]. The Autonomous Republic of Crimea is the only region within Ukraine that possesses its own constitution.\n\nOn March 16, 2014, after the occupation of Crimea by the Russian military, a referendum on joining the Russian Federation was conducted. A majority of votes supported the measure. On March 21, 2014, the Russian Duma voted to annex Crimea as a [[Republic of Crimea|subject]] into the Russian Federation. The Ukrainian government does not recognize the referendum or annexation of Crimea as legitimate. On March 27, the UN General Assembly passed [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 68/262|Resolution 68/262]] by 100 to 11 votes, recognizing the referendum as invalid and denying any legal change in the status of Crimea and Sevastopol.\n\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#ddd; vertical-align:top;\"\n!

Urban populated areas (\u043c\u0456\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043d\u0430\u0441\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u043f\u0443\u043d\u043a\u0442) can be either a city (\u043c\u0456\u0441\u0442o) or an [[urban-type settlement]] (\u0441\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0449\u0435 \u043c\u0456\u0441\u044c\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0442\u0438\u043f\u0443). For the sake of brevity, urbanized settlements are sometimes classified as towns in the [[English language]].\n\nChanges to a settlement's status can be made only by the [[Verkhovna Rada]]. Please note that the size of a settlement does not ultimately define its status, although is a major factor. For example, the city of [[Prypiat (city)|Prypiat]] still retains its status, while having a population of zero, due to its infrastructure, including buildings, roads, and utility networks.\n\nThe typical Ukrainian ''misto'' ought to be considered a [[city]], not a [[town]] (compare to [[City status in the United Kingdom]]). However, the city's subordination to either an oblast or raion also should be taken into account, especially in the [[political]] sense. Some of urbanized settlements may be cities of raion subordination, although it could seem confusing, a type of settlement should be considered first as its status is given for administrative purposes.\n\n===Cities===\n{{see also|List of cities in Ukraine}}\n[[File:Kyiv province location map.svg|thumb|left|[[Kiev Oblast|Kyiv Oblast]] for instance, has several regional city municipalities such as [[Pereiaslav]], for example, that are under direct subordination to the regional authorities.

Blinnikov, [[Guilford Press]], 2010, {{ISBN|1606239201}} (page 151)</ref> Cities may carry various status. Some may be of national importance, others of [[city of regional significance (Ukraine)|regional (oblast) importance]], and the rest of district (raion) importance. For example, the cities of ''Kyiv'' and of ''Sevastopol'' have special status of national significance and each is officially classified as a ''city with a special status'', which administratively is equivalent to an oblast. Mayors of those cities, in general, as are governors of oblasts, are appointed by the [[President of Ukraine]]. However, the status of the mayor of Kyiv is somewhat more complex, and for further information see [[Legal status and local government of Kiev|Legal status and local government of Kyiv]]. The status of Sevastopol is also unique.\n\nAlmost every oblast has at least one city of regional subordination (importance), which is the administrative center (capital) of that oblast. However, some other big cities within the oblast may have such status as well. The cities of oblast subordination have the same importance of a raion, and often are the administrative centers of such. In addition to regular raions, several Ukrainian cities with national or oblast status are further divided into ''city raions'' which may include other cities, towns, and/or villages. In 2010, Ukraine had 23 such cities with their own city raions.\n\nMany '''raions''' also have city municipalities of its level of subordination (importance). Those are usually the administrative centers (capitals). Notice that not all raions have a city as their administrative center; however all the raion centers are at least urban-like (urbanized). All administrative centers have their own form of self-administration. The municipalities of a raion subordination may administer several adjacent local councils (municipalities), usually rural. If a raion has several cities of raion (district) level, they may share administrative power for the raion.\n\n===Other municipalities===\nIn addition to city municipalities, Ukraine has urban-like municipalities. The lowest form of self-administration are the rural municipalities and villages. A rural municipality may consist of a single village, usually big, or a combination of other rural villages or localities. Note that some villages also have some additional, very small settlements. Those settlements, together with the home village, combine a local (rural) municipality (silrada). For simplicity's sake, a silrada (rural municipality) is usually referred to as a village and is the lowest level of administrative division. The status of any settlement is granted by the [[Verkhovna Rada]].\n\n===Amalgamated hromadas (AHs)===\nIn his draft [[Ukraine's constitution|constitutional]] amendments of June 2014 [[Ukrainian President]] [[Petro Poroshenko]] proposed changing the administrative divisions of Ukraine, which should include regions, districts and \"hromadas\".<ref>[http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/211043.html Poroshenko suggests granting status of regions to Crimea, Kyiv, Sevastopol, creating new political subdivision of 'community'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140701043549/http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/211043.html |date=2014-07-01 }}, [[Interfax-Ukraine]] (26 June 2014)</ref>\n\nOn February 5, 2015, the law \"On voluntary association of territorial communities\" was adopted creating ''Amalgamated hromadas (communities)'' meaning [[Settlement council (Ukraine)|settlement councils]], [[Rural council (Ukraine)|rural councils]] and a [[City of district significance (Ukraine)|city of district significance]] can create a new administrative unit.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://reformsguide.org.ua/reforms/decentralizationreform/|title=Decentralization|date=2017-02-10|website=The Reforms Guide|language=en-US|access-date=2018-12-28}}</ref> Any amalgamated hromada with a city as an administrative centre is an urban hromada, any amalgamated hromada with an urban-type settlement as an administrative centre is a settlement hromada, and any amalgamated hromada with a village as an administrative centre is a rural hromada.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://decentralization.gov.ua/en/glossary|title=Glossary|date=|website=Decentralization Reform|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-18}}</ref> New local [[elections in Ukraine|elections]] in these united territorial communities were then held.<ref>[http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/472770.html Batkivschyna party says it gets most votes at local elections], [[Interfax Ukraine]] (25 December 2017)<br>[https://www.unian.info/politics/2316594-police-investigate-voter-bribing-cases-as-local-elections-held-in-51-territorial-communities.html Police investigate voter bribing cases as local elections held in 51 territorial communities], [[UNIAN]] (25 December 2017)</ref> 226 will be holding elections in 2018 and 2019.<ref>[http://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/ukrainealert/elections-are-around-the-corner-and-ukraine-s-political-parties-are-not-ready-2 Elections Are Around the Corner, and Ukraine\u2019s Political Parties Are Not Ready], [[Atlantic Council]] (6 December 2017)</ref> The first 252 were held in 2017.<ref>[https://www.oporaua.org/en/elections/45055-interim-report-on-observation-results-of-the-first-local-elections-in-united-territorial-communities-on-29-october-2017-19102017-26102017 INTERIM REPORT ON OBSERVATION RESULTS OF THE FIRST LOCAL ELECTIONS IN UNITED TERRITORIAL COMMUNITIES ON 29 October 2017 (19.10.2017 26.10.2017)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181228223135/https://www.oporaua.org/en/elections/45055-interim-report-on-observation-results-of-the-first-local-elections-in-united-territorial-communities-on-29-october-2017-19102017-26102017 |date=28 December 2018 }}, [[PORA#OPORA|OPORA]] (31 October 2017)<br>[https://www.oporaua.org/en/elections/45165-ukraine-holds-elections-in-51-utcs-today Ukraine holds elections in 51 UTCs today] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171226020921/https://www.oporaua.org/en/elections/45165-ukraine-holds-elections-in-51-utcs-today |date=2017-12-26 }}, [[PORA#OPORA|OPORA]] (24 December 2017)</ref> \n\nThe Law \"On Local Self-Government in Ukraine\" stipulates that local budgets should have enough money to be administered by local self-government bodies.<ref name=\"Espresogr\"/> Because many of the small rural councils and cities of district significance could never hope to do this the new administrative unit ''Amalgamated hromada'' ([https://uk.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9E%D0%B1%27%D1%94%D0%B4%D0%BD%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B0_%D1%82%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%BE%D1%80%D1%96%D0%B0%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%BD%D0%B0_%D0%B3%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%B0%D0%B4%D0%B0]{{lang-uk|\u041e\u0431'\u0454\u0434\u043d\u0430\u043d\u0430 \u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0456\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430 \u0433\u0440\u043e\u043c\u0430\u0434\u0430}}, ''Obyednana terytorial\u02b9na hromada'') was created.<ref name=\"Espresogr\">{{in lang|uk}} [https://espreso.tv/article/2017/10/30/vybory_v_obyednanykh_terytorialnykh_gromadakh_scho_ce_i_dlya_chogo_potribne Elections in the united territorial communities.

Also, for disambiguation regular raions (districts) are sometimes denoted as rural to distinguish them from raions in city.<ref name=regions/>\n\nUkraine's administrative divisions are divided as follows:\n*By geographical characteristics the units are divided on regions (such as autonomous republic, oblasts, districts, cities with special status) and places of settlement (cities, towns, villages).\n*By their status they can be administrative-territorial units (oblasts and districts), self-governed territorial units (cities, towns, villages). Also the autonomous republic has a unique status of territorial autonomy, while districts in cities combine both characteristics of administrative territorial as well as self-governed territorial units.\n*By position in the system of administrative division of Ukraine, the units divided into territorial units of ''prime level'' (cities w/o district division, districts in cities, towns, villages), of ''middle level'' (districts, cities with district division), and of ''higher level'' (autonomous republic, oblasts, cities with special status).\n*Administrative division has changed because some territories are not under the control of the government. For example, Sievierodonetsk has become the new central regional center.\n\nRegions, cities, districts are governed by a state administration, a chief of which is appointed by the president after a nomination by the [[Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine|cabinet of ministers]].<ref>[http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/382028.html Poroshenko to sign Saakashvili\u2019s resignation if Cabinet submits motion], [[Interfax-Ukraine]] (7 November 2016)</ref> Crimea has its own cabinet of ministers, however the state administration is represented by the office of the Presidential Representative of Ukraine. A basic and the lowest level of administrative division is a settlement that is governed by a local council (rada). Cities as a settlement always carry a special status within a region and have their own form of self-administration (municipality \u2013 ''vykonkom'') and some may consist of their own city's districts (raions). City municipalities are governed by a mayor and a city council (miskrada). Some smaller cities, towns, and rural localities may be under control of city municipalities based on larger cities. Towns as well as villages are not controlled by state administration and are self-governed by either a town council (selyshchna rada) or a village council (silrada) within the limits of the Constitution and the laws of Ukraine (article 140 of the Constitution of Ukraine). Village councils may carry a combined jurisdiction which may include several villages and hamlets (selyshche). Unlike villages, each town council always has a separate jurisdiction which may be part of bigger city's council. Hamlet (selyshche) is a non-governed rural locality and is governed by a village council of nearby village.\n\n===Table===\nUkraine is divided into 3 main administrative divisions: [[oblast]] (region), [[raion]] (district), and council (city, settlement, and village). Note, settlements such as cities do not necessary constitute the basic level of the Ukrainian administrative territorial system. For that purpose cities are categorized into own three categories that correspond to each level of subdivisions. Cities with special status and regional significance beside being divided into special districts in city may also include smaller cities (district significance), settlements, and/or villages. Please, note that the settlement's population size is not the only factor for its status. The final decision on status change is carried out by the [[Ukrainian parliament]].

Excluded in the administrative changes was [[Western Ukraine]], which at that time formed part of the [[Second Polish Republic]] and shared in the Polish form of administrative division based on [[Voivodeships of Poland|voivodeships]].\n\nIn the post-[[World War II]] period, the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]] consisted of [[Administrative divisions of the Ukrainian SSR|25 oblasts and two cities with special status]].\n\nAfter the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, Crimea obtained the status of an autonomous republic with its own government instead of a regional state administration.\n\n==Regions==\n{{Ukraine Labelled Map|float=right}}\n\n===Autonomous republic===\n{{Main|Autonomous Republic of Crimea}}\n\nThe Autonomous Republic of Crimea, formerly the Crimean Oblast of the Ukrainian SSR, geographically encompasses the major portion of the Crimean peninsula in southern [[Ukraine]]. Its capital is [[Simferopol]]. The Autonomous Republic of Crimea is the only region within Ukraine that possesses its own constitution.\n\nOn March 16, 2014, after the occupation of Crimea by the Russian military, a referendum on joining the Russian Federation was conducted. A majority of votes supported the measure. On March 21, 2014, the Russian Duma voted to annex Crimea as a [[Republic of Crimea|subject]] into the Russian Federation. The Ukrainian government does not recognize the referendum or annexation of Crimea as legitimate. On March 27, the UN General Assembly passed [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 68/262|Resolution 68/262]] by 100 to 11 votes, recognizing the referendum as invalid and denying any legal change in the status of Crimea and Sevastopol.\n\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#ddd; vertical-align:top;\"\n!

For the sake of brevity, urbanized settlements are sometimes classified as towns in the [[English language]].\n\nChanges to a settlement's status can be made only by the [[Verkhovna Rada]]. Please note that the size of a settlement does not ultimately define its status, although is a major factor. For example, the city of [[Prypiat (city)|Prypiat]] still retains its status, while having a population of zero, due to its infrastructure, including buildings, roads, and utility networks.\n\nThe typical Ukrainian ''misto'' ought to be considered a [[city]], not a [[town]] (compare to [[City status in the United Kingdom]]). However, the city's subordination to either an oblast or raion also should be taken into account, especially in the [[political]] sense. Some of urbanized settlements may be cities of raion subordination, although it could seem confusing, a type of settlement should be considered first as its status is given for administrative purposes.\n\n===Cities===\n{{see also|List of cities in Ukraine}}\n[[File:Kyiv province location map.svg|thumb|left|[[Kiev Oblast]] for instance, has several regional city municipalities such as [[Pereiaslav]], for example, that are under direct subordination to the regional authorities.

Blinnikov, [[Guilford Press]], 2010, {{ISBN|1606239201}} (page 151)</ref> Cities may carry various status. Some may be of national importance, others of [[city of regional significance (Ukraine)|regional (oblast) importance]], and the rest of district (raion) importance. For example, the cities of ''Kiev'' and of ''Sevastopol'' have special status of national significance and each is officially classified as a ''city with a special status'', which administratively is equivalent to an oblast. Mayors of those cities, in general, as are governors of oblasts, are appointed by the [[President of Ukraine]]. However, the status of the mayor of Kiev is somewhat more complex, and for further information see [[Legal status and local government of Kiev]]. The status of Sevastopol is also unique.\n\nAlmost every oblast has at least one city of regional subordination (importance), which is the administrative center (capital) of that oblast. However, some other big cities within the oblast may have such status as well. The cities of oblast subordination have the same importance of a raion, and often are the administrative centers of such. In addition to regular raions, several Ukrainian cities with national or oblast status are further divided into ''city raions'' which may include other cities, towns, and/or villages. In 2010, Ukraine had 23 such cities with their own city raions.\n\nMany '''raions''' also have city municipalities of its level of subordination (importance). Those are usually the administrative centers (capitals). Notice that not all raions have a city as their administrative center; however all the raion centers are at least urban-like (urbanized). All administrative centers have their own form of self-administration. The municipalities of a raion subordination may administer several adjacent local councils (municipalities), usually rural. If a raion has several cities of raion (district) level, they may share administrative power for the raion.\n\n===Other municipalities===\nIn addition to city municipalities, Ukraine has urban-like municipalities. The lowest form of self-administration are the rural municipalities and villages. A rural municipality may consist of a single village, usually big, or a combination of other rural villages or localities. Note that some villages also have some additional, very small settlements.

The team is controlled by the governing body for [[football in Bhutan]], the [[Bhutan Football Federation]], which is currently a member of the [[Asian Football Federation]] and the regional body the [[South Asian Football Federation]]. Bhutan play their home games at the national stadium, [[Changlimithang Stadium|Changlimithang]]. It is one of the younger national teams in the world having played its first match in 2010.

individual [[Dzongkhag]]s.<ref name=\"Sarpang\" /> This competition was used not only to increase the popularity of football amongst women in the country, but also to act as means of identifying and coaching players who would form the first ever Bhutan women's national football squad.<ref name=\"Sarpang\" />\n\nTheir first ever competitive game was a friendly match against [[Bangladesh women's national football team|Bangladesh]] in [[Dhaka]] on 6 December 2010 as a warm up for their appearance at the inaugural [[2010 SAFF Women's Championship|SAFF Women's Championships]] a week later.<ref

their hosts.<ref name=\"FIFAResults\" /> Their competition proper got off to an even worse start as they lost 18\u20130 to [[India women's national football team|India]], one of the strongest teams in the region.<ref name=\"FIFAResults\" /> Bangladesh then repeated their performance in the pre-competition friendly running out 9\u20130 victors and eliminating Bhutan from the competition.<ref name=\"FIFAResults\" /> The team were able to salvage some pride in their final game, drawing 1\u20131 with [[Sri Lanka women's national football team|Sri Lanka]], which marks their only positive result of any kind as well as their first competitive goal (one of two times they have scored a goal in a competitive match).<ref name=\"FIFAResults\" /> Their performance at the SAFF Championships saw them gain 889 ranking points.<ref name=\"FIFARanking\">{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/worldranking/rankingtable/women/index.html|title=FIFA/Coca-Cola Women's World Ranking |date=18 March

of five competitive matches against officially ranked teams, their performance saw them achieve a higher points total than four other provisionally ranked teams: the [[United States Virgin Islands

The team is controlled by the governing body for [[football in Bhutan]], the [[Bhutan Football Federation]], which is currently a member of the [[Asian Football Federation]] and the regional body the [[South Asian Football Federation]]. Bhutan play their home games at the national stadium, [[Changlimithang Stadium|Changlimithang]]. It is one of the younger national teams in the world having played its first match in 2010. Bhutan took part in the 2014 SAFF Women's Championship in Islamabad, Pakistan at the end of 2014, losing all three games, including a 4-1 loss to host Pakistan in which Tshering Yangdon scored just

individual [[Dzongkhag]]s.<ref name=\"Sarpang\" /> This competition was used not only to increase the popularity of football amongst women in the country, but also to act as means of identifying and coaching players who would form the first ever Bhutan women's national football squad.<ref name=\"Sarpang\" />\n\nTheir first ever competitive game was a friendly match against [[Bangladesh women's national football team|Bangladesh]] in [[Dhaka]] on 6 December 2010 as a warm up for their appearance at the inaugural [[2010 SAFF Women's Championship|SAFF Women's Championships]] a week later.<ref name=\"FIFAResults\" /> Unfortunately, their debut was one to forget as, having travelled to [[Cox's Bazar]] where all of the group matches were scheduled to take place, they succumbed 7-0 to their hosts.<ref name=\"FIFAResults\" /> Their competition proper got off to an even worse start as they lost 18-0 to [[India women's national football team|India]], one of the strongest teams in the region.<ref name=\"FIFAResults\" /> Bangladesh then repeated their performance in the pre-competition friendly running out 9-0 victors and eliminating Bhutan from the competition.<ref name=\"FIFAResults\" /> The team were able to salvage some pride in their final game, drawing 1-1 with [[Sri Lanka women's national football team|Sri Lanka]], which marks their only positive result of any kind as well as their first competitive goal (one of two times they have scored a goal in a competitive match).<ref name=\"FIFAResults\" /> Their performance at the SAFF Championships saw them gain 889 ranking points.<ref name=\"FIFARanking\">{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/worldranking/rankingtable/women/index.html|title=FIFA/Coca-Cola Women's World Ranking |date=18 March

of five competitive matches against officially ranked teams, their performance saw them achieve a higher points total than four other provisionally ranked teams: the [[United States Virgin Islands

At the time, there were no other business schools and no business professors could be recruited elsewhere. Bolles, a lawyer by education and training, and business journalist by career, seemed to be the best option for Joseph Wharton.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} Bolles started his career as a lawyer in Connecticut in the second half of the 19th century. After resigning from his law firm, he started pursuing a new career in business journalism and was promoted to the editor role of ''Bankers Magazine'', a trade publication, in 1880. Upon joining the Wharton School, he began teaching business with classes on the law of governing finance and on the processes of commercial banking. Bolles' instruction in finance was influenced by his previous experience in ''Bankers Magazine'': he stressed conservative business practices, drawing on business history as much as he could. In his classes, inflationist Congressmen were \"self-interested debtors\". Besides teaching, Bolles advocated for several national reforms, including the uniform banking law.

Sass wrote about him, \"Bolles thus fulfilled Joseph Wharton's pedagogic expectations and\u2026got the new school off to a respectable start by the spring of 1883\".<ref name=\"thebhc.org\" /> In 1884, the first five business students were awarded a Bachelor of Finance degree. One graduate, Shiro Shiba, returned to Japan where he would become a member of the [[Diet (assembly)|Diet]], the Japanese parliament, and another, [[Robert Adams, Jr.]], later was named [[U.S. Ambassador to Brazil]].<ref name=\"wharton.upenn.edu\" />\n\nClasses in business and finance abounded at the Wharton School, but it was lacking in any other areas of business interest. [[Edmund J. James]], with a doctorate from the [[University of Halle]] in Germany, reinvigorated the school's curriculum, starting classes on political finance and administration. Later in 1885, James argued for redesigning the course of study at Wharton with elements of German higher education. He wanted to include training in banking, railroading, merchandising, manufacturing and other similar branches, and expand the course's length to four years from the initial three. Joseph Wharton in November 1893 pledged an additional $75,000 to the school in order to implement James' ideas in the school's curriculum. A more comprehensive study plan was then rolled out.<ref name=\"thebhc.org\" /> Between 1895 and 1915, James started teaching at Wharton the new fields of finance and management as they were developing in the business world. The Wharton School improved its reputation from a bunch of academic \"misfits\", and some of its alumni rose in the U.S. business world.<ref name=\"archives.upenn.edu\">{{cite web |url=http://www.archives.upenn.edu/histy/features/schools/wharton.html |title=History: School of the Wharton School of Business, University of Pennsylvania University Archives |publisher=Archives.upenn.edu |accessdate=October 4, 2012}}</ref> During this period, the school continued to attract additional faculty members and expand its research programs.<ref name=\"About Wharton: Past Leaders\">{{cite web |url=http://www.wharton.upenn.edu/about/past-leaders.cfm |title=About Wharton: Past Leaders |publisher=Wharton School |accessdate=January 1, 2014}}</ref>\n\nWharton began awarding MBA degrees in 1921.<ref name=\"archives.upenn.edu\" /> In 1942, during [[World War II]], in the same fashion of other schools, Wharton's full-time faculty dropped dramatically from 165 to 39 by 1944.

At the time, there were no other business schools and no business professors could be recruited elsewhere. Bolles, a lawyer by education and training, and business journalist by career, seemed to be the best option for Joseph Wharton.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} Bolles started his career as a lawyer in Connecticut in the second half of the 19th century. After resigning from his law firm, he started pursuing a new career in business journalism and was promoted to the editor role of ''Bankers Magazine'', a trade publication, in 1880. Upon joining the Wharton School, he began teaching business with classes on the law of governing finance and on the processes of commercial banking. Bolles' instruction in finance was influenced by his previous experience in ''Bankers Magazine'': he stressed conservative business practices, drawing on business history as much as he could. In his classes, inflationist Congressmen were \"self-interested debtors\". Besides teaching, Bolles advocated for several national reforms, including the uniform banking law. Wharton historian Steven A. Sass wrote about him, \"Bolles thus fulfilled Joseph Wharton's pedagogic expectations and\u2026got the new school off to a respectable start by the spring of 1883\".<ref name=\"thebhc.org\" /> In 1884, the first five business students were awarded a Bachelor of Finance degree. One graduate, Shiro Shiba, returned to Japan where he would become a member of the [[Diet (assembly)|Diet]], the Japanese parliament, and another, [[Robert Adams, Jr.]], later was named [[U.S. Ambassador to Brazil]].<ref name=\"wharton.upenn.edu\" />\n\nClasses in business and finance abounded at the Wharton School, but it was lacking in any other areas of business interest. [[Edmund J. James]], with a doctorate from the [[University of Halle]] in Germany, reinvigorated the school's curriculum, starting classes on political finance and administration. Later in 1885, James argued for redesigning the course of study at Wharton with elements of German higher education. He wanted to include training in banking, railroading, merchandising, manufacturing and other similar branches, and expand the course's length to four years from the initial three. Joseph Wharton in November 1893 pledged an additional $75,000 to the school in order to implement James' ideas in the school's curriculum. A more comprehensive study plan was then rolled out.<ref name=\"thebhc.org\" /> Between 1895 and 1915, James started teaching at Wharton the new fields of finance and management as they were developing in the business world. The Wharton School improved its reputation from a bunch of academic \"misfits\", and some of its alumni rose in the U.S. business world.<ref name=\"archives.upenn.edu\">{{cite web |url=http://www.archives.upenn.edu/histy/features/schools/wharton.html |title=History: School of the Wharton School of Business, University of Pennsylvania University Archives |publisher=Archives.upenn.edu |accessdate=October 4, 2012}}</ref> During this period, the school continued to attract additional faculty members and expand its research programs.<ref name=\"About Wharton: Past Leaders\">{{cite web |url=http://www.wharton.upenn.edu/about/past-leaders.cfm |title=About Wharton: Past Leaders |publisher=Wharton School |accessdate=January 1, 2014}}</ref>\n\nWharton began awarding MBA degrees in 1921.<ref name=\"archives.upenn.edu\" /> In 1942, during [[World War II]], in the same fashion of other schools, Wharton's full-time faculty dropped dramatically from 165 to 39 by 1944.

Unlike many other undergraduate business programs where students transfer in after their freshman or second year (University of Virginia's McIntire, Emory's Goizueta, UC Berkeley's Haas), Wharton applicants apply specifically for Wharton during their senior year of high school. These candidates are then grouped with a pool of applicants separate from those applying to University of Pennsylvania's College of Arts and Sciences (CAS), School of Engineering and Applied Science (SEAS), or School of Nursing. Each of the other three schools forms its own separate pool of applicants too.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wharton.upenn.edu/undergrad/ |title=Wharton Undergrad at the University of Pennsylvania |website=Wharton.upenn.edu |accessdate=March 3, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe [[legacy preferences|legacy status]] of applicants, defined as having a parent or another direct relative who attended the same academic institution, may be taken into consideration in the admissions process.

As a teenager she dabbled with acting by starring in [[Ram Mukherjee|her father]]'s Bengali-language film ''[[Biyer Phool]]'' and in the social drama ''[[Raja Ki Aayegi Baraat]]'' (both 1996). Mukerji had her first commercial success with the action film [[Ghulam (film)|''Ghulam'']] (1998) and breakthrough with the romance ''[[Kuch Kuch Hota Hai]]'' (1998). Following a brief setback, the year 2002 marked a turning point for her when she was cast by [[Yash Raj Films]] as the star of the drama ''[[Saathiya (film)|Saathiya]]''.\n\nMukerji established herself by starring in several commercially successful romantic films, including ''[[Chalte Chalte (2003 film)|Chalte Chalte]]'' (2003), ''[[Hum Tum]]'' (2004), ''[[Veer-Zaara]]'' (2004), and ''[[Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna]]'' (2006), and the crime comedy ''[[Bunty Aur Babli]]'' (2005). She also gained praise for playing an abused wife in the political thriller ''[[Yuva]]'' (2004) and a deaf and blind woman in the drama ''[[Black (2005 film)|Black]]'' (2005). Mukerji then collaborated with Yash Raj Films on several unsuccessful films which led critics to bemoan her choice of roles. This changed when she played a headstrong journalist in the thriller ''[[No One Killed Jessica]]'' (2011), and further success came for her starring roles in the thrillers ''[[Talaash: The Answer Lies Within]]'' (2012), ''[[Mardaani]]'' (2014) and its sequel ''[[Mardaani 2]]'' (2019), and the comedy-drama ''[[Hichki]]'' (2018).

As a teenager she dabbled with acting by starring in [[Ram Mukherjee|her father]]'s Bengali-language film ''[[Biyer Phool]]'' and in the social drama ''[[Raja Ki Aayegi Baraat]]'' (both 1996). Mukerji had her first commercial success with the action film [[Ghulam (film)|''Ghulam'']] (1998) and breakthrough with the romance ''[[Kuch Kuch Hota Hai]]'' (1998). Following a brief setback, the year 2002 marked a turning point for her when she was cast by [[Yash Raj Films]] as the star of the drama ''[[Saathiya (film)|Saathiya]]''.\n\nMukerji established herself by starring in several commercially successful romantic films, including ''[[Chalte Chalte (2003 film)|Chalte Chalte]]'' (2003), ''[[Hum Tum]]'' (2004), ''[[Veer-Zaara]]'' (2004), and ''[[Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna]]'' (2006), and the crime comedy ''[[Bunty Aur Babli]]'' (2005). She also gained praise for playing an abused wife in the political thriller ''[[Yuva]]'' (2004) and a deaf and blind woman in the drama ''[[Black (2005 film)|Black]]'' (2005). Mukerji then collaborated with Yash Raj Films on several unsuccessful films which led critics to bemoan her choice of roles. This changed when she played a headstrong journalist in the thriller ''[[No One Killed Jessica]]'' (2011), and further success came for her starring roles in the thrillers ''[[Talaash: The Answer Lies Within]]'' (2012), ''[[Mardaani]]'' (2014) and its sequel ''[[Mardaani 2]]'' (2019), and the comedy-drama ''[[Hichki]]'' (2018). The lattermost emerged as her highest-grossing release.\n\nMukerji is involved with humanitarian causes and is vocal about issues faced by women and children.

It was as a landmark study at the time, and significantly changed the management of all forms of diabetes.<ref name=Pozzilli2014/><ref>{{cite journal |title=American Diabetes Association Statement: Implications of the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial |journal=Diabetes Care |date=1 January 2003 |volume=26 |issue=Supplement 1 |pages=S25\u2013S27 |doi=10.2337/diacare.26.2007.S25|pmid=12502616 |author1=American Diabetes Association |doi-access=free }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=The effect of intensive treatment of diabetes on the development and progression of long-term complications in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus\n|author1=The Diabetes Control |author2=Complications Trial Research Group. |journal=N Engl J Med\n|pmid=8366922|doi=10.1056/NEJM199309303291401|year=1993|volume=329|pages=977\u201386|issue=14}}</ref>\n\nThe United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) was a clinical study conducted by Z that was published in ''[[The Lancet]]'' in 1998.
