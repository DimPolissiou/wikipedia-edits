It is the sixth element in [[alkaline earth metal|group 2]] of the [[periodic table]], also known as the [[alkaline earth metal]]s. Pure radium is silvery-white, but it readily reacts with nitrogen (rather than oxygen) on exposure to air, forming a black surface layer of radium nitride (Ra<sub>3</sub>N<sub>2</sub>). All isotopes of radium are highly [[radioactive]], with the most stable [[isotope]] being [[radium-226]], which has a [[half-life]] of 1600 years and [[Radioactive decay|decays]] into [[radon]] gas (specifically the isotope [[radon-222]]). When radium decays, [[ionizing radiation]] is a product, which can excite [[fluorescent]] chemicals and cause [[radioluminescence]].\n\nRadium, in the form of [[radium chloride]], was [[discovery of the chemical elements|discovered]] by [[Marie Curie|Marie]] and [[Pierre Curie]] in 1898. They extracted the radium compound from [[uraninite]] and published the discovery at the [[French Academy of Sciences]] five days later. Radium was isolated in its [[metal]]lic state by Marie Curie and [[Andr\u00e9-Louis Debierne]] through the [[electrolysis]] of radium chloride in 1911.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rsc.org/periodic-table/element/88/radium|title=Radium|publisher=Royal Society of Chemistry|access-date=5 July 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160324185543/http://www.rsc.org/periodic-table/element/88/Radium|archive-date=24 March 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn nature, radium is found in [[uranium]] and (to a lesser extent) [[thorium]] ores in trace amounts as small as a seventh of a gram per ton of uraninite. Radium is not necessary for living organisms, and adverse health effects are likely when it is incorporated into biochemical processes because of its radioactivity and chemical reactivity. Currently, other than its use in [[nuclear medicine]], radium has no commercial applications; formerly, it was used as a radioactive source for [[radioluminescent]] devices and also in [[radioactive quackery]] for its supposed curative powers. Today, these former applications are no longer in vogue because radium's toxicity has become known, and less dangerous isotopes are used instead in radioluminescent devices.\n\n==Bulk properties==\nRadium is the heaviest known [[alkaline earth metal]] and is the only [[radioactive]] member of its group. Its physical and chemical properties most closely resemble its lighter [[congener (chemistry)|congener]] [[barium]].<ref name=Greenwood112/>\n\nPure radium is a [[volatility (chemistry)|volatile]] silvery-white metal, although its lighter congeners [[calcium]], [[strontium]], and barium have a slight yellow tint.<ref name=Greenwood112>Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 112</ref> This tint rapidly vanishes on exposure to air, yielding a black layer of [[radium nitride]] (Ra<sub>3</sub>N<sub>2</sub>).<ref name=k4>Kirby et al., p. 4</ref> Its [[melting point]] is either {{convert|700|\u00b0C}} or {{convert|960|\u00b0C}}{{efn|Both values are encountered in sources and there is no agreement among scientists as to the true value of the melting point of radium.}} and its [[boiling point]] is {{convert|1737|\u00b0C}}.

Small amounts of barium impurities give the compound a rose color.<ref name=k4to8/> It is soluble in water, though less so than [[barium chloride]], and its solubility decreases with increasing concentration of [[hydrochloric acid]]. Crystallization from aqueous solution gives the dihydrate RaCl<sub>2</sub>\u00b72H<sub>2</sub>O, isomorphous with its barium analog.<ref name=k4to8/>\n\n[[Radium bromide]] (RaBr<sub>2</sub>) is also a colorless, luminous compound.<ref name=k4to8/> In water, it is more soluble than radium chloride. Like radium chloride, crystallization from aqueous solution gives the dihydrate RaBr<sub>2</sub>\u00b72H<sub>2</sub>O, isomorphous with its barium analog. The ionizing radiation emitted by radium bromide excites [[nitrogen]] molecules in the air, making it glow. The [[alpha particle]]s emitted by radium quickly gain two electrons to become neutral [[helium]], which builds up inside and weakens radium bromide crystals. This effect sometimes causes the crystals to break or even explode.<ref name=k4to8/>\n\n[[Radium nitrate]] (Ra(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>) is a white compound that can be made by dissolving [[radium carbonate]] in [[nitric acid]]. As the concentration of nitric acid increases, the solubility of radium nitrate decreases, an important property for the chemical purification of radium.<ref name=k4to8/>\n\nRadium forms much the same insoluble salts as its lighter congener barium: it forms the insoluble [[radium sulfate|sulfate]] (RaSO<sub>4</sub>, the most insoluble known sulfate), [[radium chromate|chromate]] (RaCrO<sub>4</sub>), [[radium carbonate|carbonate]] (RaCO<sub>3</sub>), [[radium iodate|iodate]] (Ra(IO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>), [[radium tetrafluoroberyllate|tetrafluoroberyllate]] (RaBeF<sub>4</sub>), and nitrate (Ra(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>). With the exception of the carbonate, all of these are less soluble in water than the corresponding barium salts, but they are all isostructural to their barium counterparts. Additionally, [[radium phosphate]], [[radium oxalate|oxalate]], and [[radium sulfite|sulfite]] are probably also insoluble, as they [[coprecipitation|coprecipitate]] with the corresponding insoluble barium salts.<ref name=k8to9>Kirby et al., pp. 8\u20139</ref> The great insolubility of radium sulfate (at 20&nbsp;\u00b0C, only 2.1&nbsp;[[milligram|mg]] will dissolve in 1&nbsp;[[kilogram|kg]] of water) means that it is one of the less biologically dangerous radium compounds.<ref name=k12>Kirby et al., p. 12</ref> The large ionic radius of Ra<sup>2+</sup> (148&nbsp;pm) results in weak complexation and poor extraction of radium from aqueous solutions when not at high pH.<ref name=Ullmann97/>\n\n==Occurrence==\nAll isotopes of radium have half-lives much shorter than the [[age of the Earth]], so that any primordial radium would have decayed long ago. Radium nevertheless still occurs [[Radium and radon in the environment|in the environment]], as the isotopes <sup>223</sup>Ra, <sup>224</sup>Ra, <sup>226</sup>Ra, and <sup>228</sup>Ra are part of the decay chains of natural thorium and uranium isotopes; since thorium and uranium have very long half-lives, these daughters are continually being regenerated by their decay.<ref name=k3/> Of these four isotopes, the longest-lived is <sup>226</sup>Ra (half-life 1600&nbsp;years), a decay product of natural uranium. Because of its relative longevity, <sup>226</sup>Ra is the most common isotope of the element, making up about one [[parts per trillion|part per trillion]] of the Earth's crust; essentially all natural radium is <sup>226</sup>Ra.<ref name=Greenwood109/> Thus, radium is found in tiny quantities in the uranium ore [[uraninite]] and various other uranium [[minerals]], and in even tinier quantities in thorium minerals.

The uranium had been extracted by dissolution in sulfuric acid leaving radium sulfate, which is similar to [[barium sulfate]] but even less soluble in the residues. The residues also contained rather substantial amounts of barium sulfate which thus acted as a carrier for the radium sulfate. The first steps of the radium extraction process involved boiling with sodium hydroxide, followed by [[hydrochloric acid]] treatment to minimize impurities of other compounds. The remaining residue was then treated with [[sodium carbonate]] to convert the barium sulfate into barium carbonate (carrying the radium), thus making it soluble in hydrochloric acid. After dissolution, the barium and radium were reprecipitated as sulfates; this was then repeated to further purify the mixed sulfate. Some impurities that form insoluble sulfides were removed by treating the chloride solution with hydrogen sulfide, followed by filtering. When the mixed sulfates were pure enough, they were once more converted to mixed chlorides; barium and radium thereafter were separated by [[fractional crystallization (chemistry)|fractional crystallisation]] while monitoring the progress using a [[spectroscope]] (radium gives characteristic red lines in contrast to the green barium lines), and the [[electroscope]].<ref>[http://lateralscience.blogspot.se/2012/11/marie-curie-method-of-extraction-of.html \"Lateral Science\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402105852/http://lateralscience.blogspot.se/2012/11/marie-curie-method-of-extraction-of.html |date=2 April 2015 }}.

Later, small companies purchased mine tailings from Joachimsthal mines and started isolating radium. In 1904, the Austrian government [[nationalization|nationalised]] the mines and stopped exporting raw ore. For some time radium availability was low.<ref name=\"Ceranski\"/>\n\nThe formation of an Austrian monopoly and the strong urge of other countries to have access to radium led to a worldwide search for uranium ores. The United States took over as leading producer in the early 1910s. The [[Carnotite]] sands in [[Colorado]] provide some of the element, but richer ores are found in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]] and the area of the [[Great Bear Lake]] and the [[Great Slave Lake]] of northwestern Canada.<ref name=crc/><ref>{{cite journal | jstor = 40796935|author=Just, Evan|author2=Swain, Philip W.|author3=Kerr, William A.|last-author-amp=yes |journal=Financial Analysts Journal|volume=8|issue=1|year=1952 |pages=85\u201393|title=Peacet\u00edme Impact of Atom\u00edc Energy | doi = 10.2469/faj.v8.n1.85}}</ref> Neither of the deposits is mined for radium but the uranium content makes mining profitable.\n\nThe Curies' process was still used for industrial radium extraction in 1940, but mixed bromides were then used for the fractionation.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1021/ed017p417| title = Extraction of radium from Canadian pitchblende| journal = Journal of Chemical Education| volume = 17| issue = 9| pages = 417| year = 1940| last1 = Kuebel | first1 = A. | bibcode = 1940JChEd..17..417K}}</ref> If the barium content of the uranium ore is not high enough it is easy to add some to carry the radium.

It is the sixth element in [[alkaline earth metal|group 2]] of the [[periodic table]], also known as the [[alkaline earth metal]]s. Pure radium is silvery-white, but it readily reacts with nitrogen (rather than oxygen) on exposure to air, forming a black surface layer of radium nitride (Ra<sub>3</sub>N<sub>2</sub>). All isotopes of radium are highly [[radioactive]], with the most stable [[isotope]] being [[radium-226]], which has a [[half-life]] of 1600 years and [[Radioactive decay|decays]] into [[radon]] gas (specifically the isotope [[radon-222]]). When radium decays, [[ionizing radiation]] is a product, which can excite [[fluorescent]] chemicals and cause [[radioluminescence]].\n\nRadium, in the form of [[radium chloride]], was [[discovery of the chemical elements|discovered]] by [[Marie Curie|Marie]] and [[Pierre Curie]] in 1898. They extracted the radium compound from [[uraninite]] and published the discovery at the [[French Academy of Sciences]] five days later.

Radium is not necessary for living organisms, and adverse health effects are likely when it is incorporated into biochemical processes because of its radioactivity and chemical reactivity. Currently, other than its use in [[nuclear medicine]], radium has no commercial applications; formerly, it was used as a radioactive source for [[radioluminescent]] devices and also in [[radioactive quackery]] for its supposed curative powers.

[[Radium hydroxide]] (Ra(OH)<sub>2</sub>) is the most readily soluble among the alkaline earth hydroxides and is a stronger base than its barium congener, [[barium hydroxide]].<ref name=k4to8>Kirby et al., pp. 4\u20138</ref> It is also more soluble than [[actinium hydroxide]] and [[thorium hydroxide]]: these three adjacent hydroxides may be separated by precipitating them with [[ammonia]].<ref name=k4to8/>\n\n[[Radium chloride]] (RaCl<sub>2</sub>) is a colorless, luminous compound. It becomes yellow after some time due to self-damage by the [[alpha radiation]] given off by radium when it decays. Small amounts of barium impurities give the compound a rose color.<ref name=k4to8/> It is soluble in water, though less so than [[barium chloride]], and its solubility decreases with increasing concentration of [[hydrochloric acid]]. Crystallization from aqueous solution gives the dihydrate RaCl<sub>2</sub>\u00b72H<sub>2</sub>O, isomorphous with its barium analog.<ref name=k4to8/>\n\n[[Radium bromide]] (RaBr<sub>2</sub>) is also a colorless, luminous compound.<ref name=k4to8/> In water, it is more soluble than radium chloride. Like radium chloride, crystallization from aqueous solution gives the dihydrate RaBr<sub>2</sub>\u00b72H<sub>2</sub>O, isomorphous with its barium analog. The ionizing radiation emitted by radium bromide excites [[nitrogen]] molecules in the air, making it glow. The [[alpha particle]]s emitted by radium quickly gain two electrons to become neutral [[helium]], which builds up inside and weakens radium bromide crystals. This effect sometimes causes the crystals to break or even explode.<ref name=k4to8/>\n\n[[Radium nitrate]] (Ra(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>) is a white compound that can be made by dissolving [[radium carbonate]] in [[nitric acid]]. As the concentration of nitric acid increases, the solubility of radium nitrate decreases, an important property for the chemical purification of radium.<ref name=k4to8/>\n\nRadium forms much the same insoluble salts as its lighter congener barium: it forms the insoluble [[radium sulfate|sulfate]] (RaSO<sub>4</sub>, the most insoluble known sulfate), [[radium chromate|chromate]] (RaCrO<sub>4</sub>), [[radium carbonate|carbonate]] (RaCO<sub>3</sub>), [[radium iodate|iodate]] (Ra(IO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>), [[radium tetrafluoroberyllate|tetrafluoroberyllate]] (RaBeF<sub>4</sub>), and nitrate (Ra(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>). With the exception of the carbonate, all of these are less soluble in water than the corresponding barium salts, but they are all isostructural to their barium counterparts. Additionally, [[radium phosphate]], [[radium oxalate|oxalate]], and [[radium sulfite|sulfite]] are probably also insoluble, as they [[coprecipitation|coprecipitate]] with the corresponding insoluble barium salts.<ref name=k8to9>Kirby et al., pp. 8\u20139</ref> The great insolubility of radium sulfate (at 20&nbsp;\u00b0C, only 2.1&nbsp;[[milligram|mg]] will dissolve in 1&nbsp;[[kilogram|kg]] of water) means that it is one of the less biologically dangerous radium compounds.<ref name=k12>Kirby et al., p. 12</ref> The large ionic radius of Ra<sup>2+</sup> (148&nbsp;pm) results in weak complexation and poor extraction of radium from aqueous solutions when not at high pH.<ref name=Ullmann97/>\n\n==Occurrence==\nAll isotopes of radium have half-lives much shorter than the [[age of the Earth]], so that any primordial radium would have decayed long ago. Radium nevertheless still occurs [[Radium and radon in the environment|in the environment]], as the isotopes <sup>223</sup>Ra, <sup>224</sup>Ra, <sup>226</sup>Ra, and <sup>228</sup>Ra are part of the decay chains of natural thorium and uranium isotopes; since thorium and uranium have very long half-lives, these daughters are continually being regenerated by their decay.<ref name=k3/> Of these four isotopes, the longest-lived is <sup>226</sup>Ra (half-life 1600&nbsp;years), a decay product of natural uranium.

The uranium had been extracted by dissolution in sulfuric acid leaving radium sulfate, which is similar to [[barium sulfate]] but even less soluble in the residues. The residues also contained rather substantial amounts of barium sulfate which thus acted as a carrier for the radium sulfate. The first steps of the radium extraction process involved boiling with sodium hydroxide, followed by [[hydrochloric acid]] treatment to minimize impurities of other compounds. The remaining residue was then treated with [[sodium carbonate]] to convert the barium sulfate into barium carbonate (carrying the radium), thus making it soluble in hydrochloric acid. After dissolution, the barium and radium were reprecipitated as sulfates; this was then repeated to further purify the mixed sulfate. Some impurities that form insoluble sulfides were removed by treating the chloride solution with hydrogen sulfide, followed by filtering. When the mixed sulfates were pure enough, they were once more converted to mixed chlorides; barium and radium thereafter were separated by [[fractional crystallization (chemistry)|fractional crystallisation]] while monitoring the progress using a [[spectroscope]] (radium gives characteristic red lines in contrast to the green barium lines), and the [[electroscope]].<ref>[http://lateralscience.blogspot.se/2012/11/marie-curie-method-of-extraction-of.html \"Lateral Science\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402105852/http://lateralscience.blogspot.se/2012/11/marie-curie-method-of-extraction-of.html |date=2 April 2015 }}.

Later, small companies purchased mine tailings from Joachimsthal mines and started isolating radium. In 1904, the Austrian government [[nationalization|nationalised]] the mines and stopped exporting raw ore. For some time radium availability was low.<ref name=\"Ceranski\"/>\n\nThe formation of an Austrian monopoly and the strong urge of other countries to have access to radium led to a worldwide search for uranium ores. The United States took over as leading producer in the early 1910s. The [[Carnotite]] sands in [[Colorado]] provide some of the element, but richer ores are found in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]] and the area of the [[Great Bear Lake]] and the [[Great Slave Lake]] of northwestern Canada.<ref name=crc/><ref>{{cite journal | jstor = 40796935|author=Just, Evan|author2=Swain, Philip W.|author3=Kerr, William A.|last-author-amp=yes |journal=Financial Analysts Journal|volume=8|issue=1|year=1952 |pages=85\u201393|title=Peacet\u00edme Impact of Atom\u00edc Energy | doi = 10.2469/faj.v8.n1.85}}</ref> Neither of the deposits is mined for radium but the uranium content makes mining profitable.\n\nThe Curies' process was still used for industrial radium extraction in 1940, but mixed bromides were then used for the fractionation.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1021/ed017p417| title = Extraction of radium from Canadian pitchblende| journal = Journal of Chemical Education| volume = 17| issue = 9| pages = 417| year = 1940| last1 = Kuebel | first1 = A. | bibcode = 1940JChEd..17..417K}}</ref> If the barium content of the uranium ore is not high enough it is easy to add some to carry the radium.

The French physicist [[Antoine Becquerel]] carried a small ampoule of radium in his waistcoat pocket for six hours and reported that his skin became [[Ulcer (dermatology)|ulcerated]]. Pierre and Marie Curie were so intrigued by radiation that they sacrificed their own health to learn more about it. Pierre Curie attached a tube filled with radium to his arm for ten hours, which resulted in the appearance of a skin lesion, suggesting the use of radium to attack cancerous tissue as it had attacked healthy tissue.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Redniss|first1=Lauren|title=Radioactive: Marie & Pierre Curie: A Tale Of Love And Fallout|date=2011|publisher=HarperCollins|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-06-135132-7|page=70}}</ref> Handling of radium has been blamed for Marie Curie's death due to [[aplastic anemia]].
