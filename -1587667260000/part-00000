He also won the [[Grand Prix (snooker)|Grand Prix]] in 1984 and the [[Masters (snooker)|Masters]] in 1987. Taylor is also well known for his sense of humour and his trademark oversized spectacles. He made regular appearances on the snooker game show ''[[Big Break]]''.<ref>{{citeweb|title=Snooker legend Dennis Taylor to meet East Lancashire teenagers|url=http://www.lancashiretelegraph.co.uk/news/10631771.Snooker_legend_Dennis_Taylor_to_meet_East_Lancashire_teenagers/|accessdate=6 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n\n===Early career===\nTaylor turned professional in 1972<ref>{{citeweb|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/fame-fortune/dennis-taylor-had-200-bank-became-snooker-player/|title=Dennis Taylor: 'I had \u00a3200 in the bank when I became a snooker player'|publisher=The Telegraph|date=12 February 2017|accessdate=15 March 2020}}</ref> and made his world championship debut in [[1973 World Snooker Championship|1973]], narrowly losing to [[Cliff Thorburn]] in the first round.<ref name=\"GSC profile\">{{cite web|title=Past Masters: Dennis Taylor|url=http://www.globalsnookercentre.co.uk/files/Players/Global_Europe/Global_Ireland/ni_dennis_taylor.htm|publisher=Global Snooker Centre|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080222215337/http://www.globalsnookercentre.co.uk/files/Players/Global_Europe/Global_Ireland/ni_dennis_taylor.htm|archivedate=22 February 2008}}</ref>  After world semi-final losses in [[1975 World Snooker Championship|1975]] and [[1977 World Snooker Championship|1977]], Taylor reached his first World Championship final in [[1979 World Snooker Championship|1979]], but lost 16\u201324 to debutant [[Terry Griffiths]].<ref name=\"GSC profile\"/><ref name=\"WS profile\">{{World Snooker|senior|13165~2234125,00|30 March 2011}}</ref>\n\nHaving reached the semi-final of the World Championship in [[1984 World Snooker Championship|1984]], losing to Steve Davis, Taylor was playing very well as he began the [[1984\u201385 snooker season|1984\u201385 season]]. In September, however, he was devastated by the sudden death of his mother, which caused him to withdraw before his Quarterfinal match against [[Silvino Francisco]] took place in the Jameson International. His first ranking event win came later in 1984, when he won the [[Grand Prix (snooker)|Rothmans Grand Prix]] by beating Cliff Thorburn 10\u20132 in the final.\n\n===The 1985 final===\n\nLater that season he reached his second world final in [[1985 World Snooker Championship final|1985]], where he faced Steve Davis, world number one, reigning world champion and the dominant player of the 1980s. Taylor trailed 0\u20138 after the first session, but bounced back to trail 7\u20139 and 15\u201317 and then level at 17\u201317. In an incredibly tense final frame, the score was 62\u201344 to Davis with only the brown, blue, pink and black still on the table. While Davis needed only the brown, Taylor needed all the colours. He potted a long brown, which he says was one of his best ever shots under pressure.<ref>{{citeweb|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/general/others/great-sporting-moments-dennis-taylor-defeats-steve-davis-18-17-at-the-crucible-1741225.html|title=Great Sporting Moments: Dennis Taylor defeats Steve Davis 18-17 at the Crucible|publisher=The Independent|date=12 July 2009|accessdate=15 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nA tricky blue and a difficult pink also went in, bringing the frame score to 62\u201359 to ensure that, for the first time ever, the title would be decided on the black ball. Taylor eventually potted the black after Davis had missed a tricky cut into the top pocket and, amid euphoric scenes watched by over 18 million viewers well after midnight on live BBC television, took the title at the relatively advanced age of 36. The number of viewers is still a record for any program on [[BBC2]],<ref>{{citeweb|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/only-in-britain/dennis-taylor-steve-davis-snooker-world-championship/|title=Dennis Taylor beat Steve Davis in the World Championship, against all odds|publisher=The Telegraph|date=28 April 2016|accessdate=15 March 2020}}</ref> and is considered by many to be the greatest snooker match in history.<ref>{{citeweb|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/snooker/39772632|title=World Championship: 1985 black-ball final voted most memorable Crucible moment|publisher=BBC|date=1 May 2017|accessdate=15 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nDavis later drily commented that the match had all been there \"in black and white\".<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/snooker/2953933.stm|title=1985:the black ball final|publisher=BBC|date=18 April 2003|accessdate=15 March 2020}}</ref> The World Championship win added to Taylor's popularity. On his return to Coalisland with the world trophy he was mobbed by the town's inhabitants, and he appeared widely on television thereafter.<ref>{{citeweb|url=https://www.rte.ie/archives/2015/0506/699056-dennis-taylor-receives-heroes-welcome/|title=World Champion Dennis Taylor Returns to Coalisland 1985|publisher=RT\u00c9.ie|accessdate=15 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Later career===\nTaylor reached the [[Grand Prix (snooker)|Rothmans Grand Prix]] final again in autumn 1985, and again faced Davis in a match that went to a deciding frame, but this time was beaten 9\u201310. As with all other first-time world champions so far, Taylor succumbed to the \"[[Crucible curse]]\" on his return to the [[Crucible Theatre]] [[World Snooker Championship 1986|the following year]] and lost 6\u201310 to [[Mike Hallett]] in the opening match, humorously acknowledging defeat by putting his handkerchief on the end of his cue to resemble a [[white flag]]. He won the [[Masters (snooker)|Benson & Hedges Masters]] in 1987, beating [[Alex Higgins]] 9\u20138 in the final, having trailed 5\u20138.\n\nTaylor had a well-publicized row with Higgins at the 1990 snooker World Cup in which the Northern Ireland team were beaten by Canada in the final, which ended with Higgins threatening to have Taylor shot, a threat Taylor understandably took seriously since he and Higgins belonged to opposite sides of Northern Ireland's [[sectarianism|sectarian]] [[The Troubles|divide]]. Shortly afterwards they met in the quarter-finals of the [[1990 Irish Masters|Irish Masters]], and a determined Taylor won 5\u20132. The match was attended by a young [[Ken Doherty]]. Taylor also beat [[Jimmy White]] 6\u20135 in the semi-finals but, emotionally drained by the Higgins match, lost 4\u20139 to Davis in the final. Taylor and Higgins were later reconciled.\n\nTaylor and Davis met in the World Championship for a second time in 1991, this time in the quarter-finals. Davis won this match 13\u20137 to advance to the semi-final.\n\nTaylor was renowned for the glasses he wore during matches, with their large frame and unusual 'upside-down' structure that is required to avoid a player looking over the top of the lenses when down on a shot. As a member of the [[Matchroom]] group of players (managed by promoter [[Barry Hearn]]), Taylor performed on the hit single with [[Chas & Dave]], \"[[Snooker Loopy]]\", which peaked at #5 in the UK singles chart. His perceived bad eyesight was parodied in the song with the lines ''\"them long shots, he never ever got. Why the old mind boggles. But nowadays he pots the lot\"'' with Taylor himself singing ''\"'cos I wear these goggles\"''.<ref>{{citeweb|url=https://theoldgreenbaize.com/2018/09/23/dennis-taylor-pays-tribute-to-snooker-loopy-star-chas-hodges/|title=Dennis Taylor pays tribute to Snooker Loopy star Chas Hodges|publisher=theoldgreenbaize.com|date=23 September 2018|accessdate=15 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nHe was also one of the first players to develop a relative competence in using his left hand to play the game, though he himself said this was partly because he hated to play shots with the rest. Taylor's form deteriorated at quite a pace in the 1990s. He was seeded 15 going into the [[1994 World Snooker Championship|1994 World Championship]] but lost 6\u201310 to then 18 year-old qualifier [[Ronnie O'Sullivan]] in the first round, in what was the future 5-time World Champion's first victory at The Crucible; this proved to be Taylor's last appearance at the World Championship as he dropped out of the top 16 for the following season as a result, the last remaining player who had been in the original world rankings in 1976, and failed to qualify for the tournament in subsequent years. He retired from playing in 2000.<ref name=\"WS profile\"/>\n\n===Personal life===\nTaylor now commentates on the three televised snooker tournaments each year for the [[BBC]] and is known for his bona fide and light-hearted commentary. His most famous commentary incident occurred in 1998 when co-commentator [[Clive Everton]] nearly strangled Taylor after instinctively grabbing his tie as he fell off his chair.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrUYFNHcJEQ YouTube video of the Everton necktie incident with interview]</ref> Everton wrongly believed one snooker was required by a player before Taylor stated correctly that he actually needed three snookers to get back into the frame. Everton subsequently proclaimed that his \"brains have gone completely\" before leaning back in his chair which then gave way. He reached out as he fell, grabbing Taylor's tie and pulling him down with him. An audible bang rang around the auditorium as Everton fell off his chair and out the commentary box with Taylor laughing uncontrollably.\n\nTaylor has also made guest appearances on [[Big Break]], [[They Think It's All Over (TV series)|They Think It's All Over]], [[Russian Roulette (game show)|Russian Roulette]], [[A Question of Sport]], [[The Weakest Link]] and [[The Sooty Show]]. In 2005, he was one of the celebrities taking part in the third series of the successful BBC show [[Strictly Come Dancing]], reaching eighth place with his partner Izabela Hannah.\n\nIn February 1990, Taylor officially opened the [[Royal Mail]] [[Sorting office]] in [[Blackburn]], [[Lancashire]], giving it his own stamp of approval. He then took part in a one-frame friendly challenge match.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lancashiretelegraph.co.uk/news/6092996.TEN_YEARS_AGO__Royal_Mail_on_cue/|title=TEN YEARS AGO: Royal Mail on cue|date=February 15, 2000|accessdate=July 31, 2016}}</ref> Taylor currently lives in [[Llay]] near [[Wrexham]] and has been a resident of the village since April 2003. His son Damien is a professional golf coach. His autobiography is entitled ''Frame By Frame''.\n\n==Performance and rankings timeline==\n<div style=\"width:auto; overflow:scroll\">\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:0 1em 0 0; border:1px #aaa solid; border-collapse:collapse; font-size:85%\"\n|- style=\"background:#efefef;\"\n!

sport's most memorable finals. He also won the [[Grand Prix (snooker)|Grand Prix]] in 1984 and the [[Masters (snooker)|Masters]] in 1987. Taylor is also well known for his sense of humour and his trademark oversized spectacles. He made regular appearances on the snooker game show ''[[Big Break]]''.<ref>{{citeweb|title=Snooker legend Dennis Taylor to meet East Lancashire teenagers|url=http://www.lancashiretelegraph.co.uk/news/10631771.Snooker_legend_Dennis_Taylor_to_meet_East_Lancashire_teenagers/|accessdate=6 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n\n===Early career===\nTaylor turned professional in 1972<ref>{{citeweb|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/fame-fortune/dennis-taylor-had-200-bank-became-snooker-player/|title=Dennis Taylor: 'I had \u00a3200 in the bank when I became a snooker player'|publisher=The Telegraph|date=12 February 2017|accessdate=15 March 2020}}</ref> and made his world championship debut in [[1973 World Snooker Championship|1973]], narrowly losing to [[Cliff Thorburn]] in the first round.<ref name=\"GSC profile\">{{cite web|title=Past Masters: Dennis Taylor|url=http://www.globalsnookercentre.co.uk/files/Players/Global_Europe/Global_Ireland/ni_dennis_taylor.htm|publisher=Global Snooker Centre|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080222215337/http://www.globalsnookercentre.co.uk/files/Players/Global_Europe/Global_Ireland/ni_dennis_taylor.htm|archivedate=22 February 2008}}</ref>  After world semi-final losses in [[1975 World Snooker Championship|1975]] and [[1977 World Snooker Championship|1977]], Taylor reached his first World Championship final in [[1979 World Snooker Championship|1979]], but lost 16\u201324 to debutant [[Terry Griffiths]].<ref name=\"GSC profile\"/><ref name=\"WS profile\">{{World Snooker|senior|13165~2234125,00|30 March 2011}}</ref>\n\nHaving reached the semi-final of the World Championship in [[1984 World Snooker Championship|1984]], losing to Steve Davis, Taylor was playing very well as he began the [[Snooker season 1984/1985|1984/85 season]]. In September, however, he was devastated by the sudden death of his mother, which caused him to withdraw before his Quarterfinal match against [[Silvino Francisco]] took place in the Jameson International. His first ranking event win came later in 1984, when he won the [[Grand Prix (snooker)|Rothmans Grand Prix]] by beating Cliff Thorburn 10\u20132 in the final.\n\n===The 1985 final===\n\nLater that season he reached his second world final in [[1985 World Snooker Championship final|1985]], where he faced Steve Davis, world number one, reigning world champion and the dominant player of the 1980s. Taylor trailed 0\u20138 after the first session, but bounced back to trail 7\u20139 and 15\u201317 and then level at 17\u201317. In an incredibly tense final frame, the score was 62\u201344 to Davis with only the brown, blue, pink and black still on the table. While Davis needed only the brown, Taylor needed all the colours. He potted a long brown, which he says was one of his best ever shots under pressure.<ref>{{citeweb|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/general/others/great-sporting-moments-dennis-taylor-defeats-steve-davis-18-17-at-the-crucible-1741225.html|title=Great Sporting Moments: Dennis Taylor defeats Steve Davis 18-17 at the Crucible|publisher=The Independent|date=12 July 2009|accessdate=15 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nA tricky blue and a difficult pink also went in, bringing the frame score to 62\u201359 to ensure that, for the first time ever, the title would be decided on the black ball. Taylor eventually potted the black after Davis had missed a tricky cut into the top pocket and, amid euphoric scenes watched by over 18 million viewers well after midnight on live BBC television, took the title at the relatively advanced age of 36. The number of viewers is still a record for any program on [[BBC2]],<ref>{{citeweb|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/only-in-britain/dennis-taylor-steve-davis-snooker-world-championship/|title=Dennis Taylor beat Steve Davis in the World Championship, against all odds|publisher=The Telegraph|date=28 April 2016|accessdate=15 March 2020}}</ref> and is considered by many to be the greatest snooker match in history.<ref>{{citeweb|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/snooker/39772632|title=World Championship: 1985 black-ball final voted most memorable Crucible moment|publisher=BBC|date=1 May 2017|accessdate=15 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nDavis later drily commented that the match had all been there \"in black and white\".<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/snooker/2953933.stm|title=1985:the black ball final|publisher=BBC|date=18 April 2003|accessdate=15 March 2020}}</ref> The World Championship win added to Taylor's popularity. On his return to Coalisland with the world trophy he was mobbed by the town's inhabitants, and he appeared widely on television thereafter.<ref>{{citeweb|url=https://www.rte.ie/archives/2015/0506/699056-dennis-taylor-receives-heroes-welcome/|title=World Champion Dennis Taylor Returns to Coalisland 1985|publisher=RT\u00c9.ie|accessdate=15 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Later career===\nTaylor reached the [[Grand Prix (snooker)|Rothmans Grand Prix]] final again in autumn 1985, and again faced Davis in a match that went to a deciding frame, but this time was beaten 9\u201310. As with all other first-time world champions so far, Taylor succumbed to the \"[[Crucible curse]]\" on his return to the [[Crucible Theatre]] [[World Snooker Championship 1986|the following year]] and lost 6\u201310 to [[Mike Hallett]] in the opening match, humorously acknowledging defeat by putting his handkerchief on the end of his cue to resemble a [[white flag]]. He won the [[Masters (snooker)|Benson & Hedges Masters]] in 1987, beating [[Alex Higgins]] 9\u20138 in the final, having trailed 5\u20138. \n\nTaylor had a well-publicized row with Higgins at the 1990 snooker World Cup in which the Northern Ireland team were beaten by Canada in the final, which ended with Higgins threatening to have Taylor shot, a threat Taylor understandably took seriously since he and Higgins belonged to opposite sides of Northern Ireland's [[sectarianism|sectarian]] [[The Troubles|divide]]. Shortly afterwards they met in the quarter-finals of the [[1990 Irish Masters|Irish Masters]], and a determined Taylor won 5\u20132. The match was attended by a young [[Ken Doherty]]. Taylor also beat [[Jimmy White]] 6\u20135 in the semi-finals but, emotionally drained by the Higgins match, lost 4\u20139 to Davis in the final. Taylor and Higgins were later reconciled.\n\nTaylor and Davis met in the World Championship for a second time in 1991, this time in the quarter-finals. Davis won this match 13\u20137 to advance to the semi-final.\n\nTaylor was renowned for the glasses he wore during matches, with their large frame and unusual 'upside-down' structure that is required to avoid a player looking over the top of the lenses when down on a shot. As a member of the [[Matchroom]] group of players (managed by promoter [[Barry Hearn]]), Taylor performed on the hit single with [[Chas & Dave]], \"[[Snooker Loopy]]\", which peaked at #5 in the UK singles chart. His perceived bad eyesight was parodied in the song with the lines ''\"them long shots, he never ever got. Why the old mind boggles. But nowadays he pots the lot\"'' with Taylor himself singing ''\"'cos I wear these goggles\"''.<ref>{{citeweb|url=https://theoldgreenbaize.com/2018/09/23/dennis-taylor-pays-tribute-to-snooker-loopy-star-chas-hodges/|title=Dennis Taylor pays tribute to Snooker Loopy star Chas Hodges|publisher=theoldgreenbaize.com|date=23 September 2018|accessdate=15 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nHe was also one of the first players to develop a relative competence in using his left hand to play the game, though he himself said this was partly because he hated to play shots with the rest. Taylor's form deteriorated at quite a pace in the 1990s. He was seeded 15 going into the [[1994 World Snooker Championship|1994 World Championship]] but lost 6\u201310 to then 18 year-old qualifier [[Ronnie O'Sullivan]] in the first round, in what was the future 5-time World Champion's first victory at The Crucible; this proved to be Taylor's last appearance at the World Championship as he dropped out of the top 16 for the following season as a result, the last remaining player who had been in the original world rankings in 1976, and failed to qualify for the tournament in subsequent years. He retired from playing in 2000.<ref name=\"WS profile\"/>\n\n===Personal life===\nTaylor now commentates on the three televised snooker tournaments each year for the [[BBC]] and is known for his bona fide and light-hearted commentary. His most famous commentary incident occurred in 1998 when co-commentator [[Clive Everton]] nearly strangled Taylor after instinctively grabbing his tie as he fell off his chair.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrUYFNHcJEQ YouTube video of the Everton necktie incident with interview]</ref> Everton wrongly believed one snooker was required by a player before Taylor stated correctly that he actually needed three snookers to get back into the frame. Everton subsequently proclaimed that his \"brains have gone completely\" before leaning back in his chair which then gave way. He reached out as he fell, grabbing Taylor's tie and pulling him down with him. An audible bang rang around the auditorium as Everton fell off his chair and out the commentary box with Taylor laughing uncontrollably.\n\nTaylor has also made guest appearances on [[Big Break]], [[They Think It's All Over (TV series)|They Think It's All Over]], [[Russian Roulette (game show)|Russian Roulette]], [[A Question of Sport]], [[The Weakest Link]] and [[The Sooty Show]]. In 2005, he was one of the celebrities taking part in the third series of the successful BBC show [[Strictly Come Dancing]], reaching eighth place with his partner Izabela Hannah.\n\nIn February 1990, Taylor officially opened the [[Royal Mail]] [[Sorting office]] in [[Blackburn]], [[Lancashire]], giving it his own stamp of approval. He then took part in a one-frame friendly challenge match.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lancashiretelegraph.co.uk/news/6092996.TEN_YEARS_AGO__Royal_Mail_on_cue/|title=TEN YEARS AGO: Royal Mail on cue|date=February 15, 2000|accessdate=July 31, 2016}}</ref> Taylor currently lives in [[Llay]] near [[Wrexham]] and has been a resident of the village since April 2003. His son Damien is a professional golf coach. His autobiography is entitled ''Frame By Frame''.\n\n==Performance and rankings timeline==\n<div style=\"width:auto; overflow:scroll\">\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:0 1em 0 0; border:1px #aaa solid; border-collapse:collapse; font-size:85%\"\n|- style=\"background:#efefef;\"\n!

It has since gone on to professional productions in the [[West End theatre|West End]] and internationally.\n\n== Plot ==\nThe show opens with the six Queens performing an opening number in pop-concert, girl-group fashion introducing themselves. They also welcome the audience to the performance (\"Ex-Wives\"). They address the crowd and tell them that this show will feature a competition, and whoever had the \"biggest load of B.S.\" to deal with from the man who married them, [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], will be the lead singer of the group (\"Ex-Wives (Reprise)\"). They perform in the order in which they were married to Henry. [[Catherine of Aragon]] starts off and recounts her marriage to Henry and later annulment, and almost being put into a nunnery when he began lusting after [[Anne Boleyn]] (\"No Way\"). When Aragon claims that she is the winner, the other Queens mention Anne and how she overlapped with Aragon during the former's marriage, resulting in said annulment (\"Anne Boleyn (Interlude)\"), and Anne recounts her time as Queen with Henry and her eventual execution (\"Don't Lose Ur Head\"). She then continues to argue that she deserves to win the competition due to her execution and further begins to sing a new solo 'about the moment [she] found out Catherine of Aragon had tragically died'. This attempted solo is interrupted by the other queens. [[Jane Seymour]] then announces it's her turn to recount what she put up with, but the other Queens mock her for not having as much to deal with as, in her words, she was \"the only one he truly loved\". Jane admits that while she may have been lucky for not having to suffer at his hand, she still stood by him throughout all his faults (\"Heart of Stone\").\n\nThe story then shifts as the Queens are suddenly turned into members of [[Hans Holbein the Younger|Hans Holbein]]'s painting studio, talking about how they make the women he paints look beautiful for their portraits (\"Haus of Holbein\"). In a set-up parodying [[Tinder (app)|Tinder]] (or another similar dating site) they present three women: [[Christina of Denmark]], [[Amalia of Cleves]], and [[Anne of Cleves|Anna of Cleves]],{{efn|The character goes by the German spelling, 'Anna', instead of the traditionally anglicised, Anne.}} Amalia's elder sister. When Henry \"swipes right\", so to speak, on Anna, they all assume he will marry Anna and that they will have a happy, long-lasting marriage (\"Haus of Holbein (Playoff)\"). Of course, their union is ultimately ill-fated as he rejects Anna, and she pretends to make a big deal about how she is then forced to live in a beautiful palace in Richmond as a result, though she's not really complaining. She then boasts about her riches and how since she remained unmarried after her divorce, there is no man around to tell her what to do, meaning she is able to do anything she pleases (\"Get Down\"). After the Queens point out how Anna's life doesn't sound that difficult, Anna says \"Oh, well, back to the palace\". As [[Catherine Howard|Katherine Howard]] is next to go, the Queens belittle her for being \"the least relevant Catherine\", but Katherine retaliates by mentioning flaws in the other Queens' reasons for winning, such as how Anne Boleyn wasn't the only beheaded wife and how Jane Seymour only died due to natural causes. She then recounts her life and the men who abused her, leading into her marriage to Henry as she breaks down, fully realizing the trauma she suffered from her relationships and how these \"all-powerful men\" led to her eventual beheading (\"All You Wanna Do\").\n\nAs the Queens continue to squabble about who should win the contest, a frustrated [[Catherine Parr]] puts a stop to it. Questioning the point of it all, she brings up the fact that they're remembered solely by their shared connection to Henry, not as individuals. When they refuse to listen, claiming she has no story to tell that involves Henry, Parr tells her story, and of the accomplishments she made independently of Henry (\"I Don't Need Your Love\"). The other Queens, realising that they've let themselves be defined by Henry for so long, stop the contest and declare that they don't need his love to feel validated as people (\"I Don't Need Your Love (Remix)\"). With only five minutes left in the show after the fact, they decide to use their remaining moments on stage to \"rewrite\" the stories they told and sing for themselves for a change, singing together as a group rather than as solo artists and writing their own [[Happy ending|happily ever after]] (\"Six\").\n\nIn all of the live performances of the show as of July 2018, the Queens perform an encore number that is not featured on the Original Cast Recording, which is a mashup of all the songs performed in the show (minus \"Haus of Holbein\") called \"Megasix\". The audience is encouraged by the Queens to film this portion of the performance \u2013 the exception is on all USA engagements of ''Six'' after the Chicago premiere due to union rules.\n\n==Musical numbers==\n\n* \"Ex-Wives\" \u2013 The Queens\n* \"Ex-Wives (Reprise/Playoff)\" \u2013 The Queens \u2020\n* \"No Way\" \u2013 Catherine of Aragon and Ensemble\n* \"Anne Boleyn (Interlude)\" \u2013 The Queens \u2020\n* \"Don't Lose Ur Head\" \u2013 Anne Boleyn and Ensemble \n* \"Heart of Stone\" \u2013 Jane Seymour and Ensemble  \n* \"Haus of Holbein\" \u2013 Company\n* \"Haus of Holbein (Playoff)\" \u2013 Company \u2020\n* \"Get Down\" \u2013 Anna of Cleves and Ensemble \n* \"All You Wanna Do\" \u2013 Katherine Howard and Ensemble \n* \"I Don't Need Your Love\" \u2013 Catherine Parr\n* \"I Don't Need Your Love (Remix)\" \u2013 Catherine Parr and the Queens \u2020\u2020\n* \"Six\" \u2013 The Queens\n* \"Megasix\" \u2013 The Queens \u2020\n\n\u2020 Not included on the Studio Cast Recording.<br />\n\u2020\u2020 Included as part of \"I Don't Need Your Love\" on the Studio Cast Recording.\n\n== Productions ==\n=== Writing and Edinburgh Fringe ===\nThe idea for the musical came to Toby Marlow while studying in his final year at Cambridge University, and despite uncertainties from collaborator Lucy Moss, the pair wrote part of the show while studying for their final exams.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thejc.com/culture/theatre/six-the-musical-steps-from-fringe-to-the-west-end-1.469323|title=We wrote a musical during our finals...now it's on in the West End|website= The JC|access-date=2018-11-06}}</ref> Marlow had been selected in late 2016 by Cambridge University Arts Society to write a new musical to be performed at the [[Edinburgh Fringe]], and the initial six wives' concert concept came to him later during a poetry class when he decided to get his friend Moss involved.

It has since gone on to professional productions in the [[West End theatre|West End]] and internationally.\n\n== Plot ==\nThe show opens with the six Queens performing an opening number in pop-concert, girl-group fashion introducing themselves. They also welcome the audience to the performance (\"Ex-Wives\"). They address the crowd and tell them that this show will feature a competition, and whoever had the \"biggest load of B.S.\" to deal with from the man who married them, [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], will be the leader of the group (\"Ex-Wives (Reprise)\"). [[Catherine of Aragon]] starts off and recounts her marriage to Henry and later annulment, and almost being put into a nunnery when he began lusting after [[Anne Boleyn]] (\"No Way\"). When Aragon claims that she is the winner, the other Queens mention Anne and how she overlapped with Aragon during the former's marriage, resulting in said annulment (\"Anne Boleyn (Interlude)\"), and Anne recounts her time as Queen with Henry and her eventual execution (\"Don't Lose Ur Head\"). She then continues to argue that she deserves to win the competition due to her execution and further begins to sing a new solo 'about the moment [she] found out Catherine of Aragon had tragically died'. This attempted solo is interrupted by the other queens. [[Jane Seymour]] then announces it's her turn to recount what she put up with, but the other Queens mock her for not having as much to deal with as, in her words, she was \"the only one he truly loved\". Jane admits that while she may have been lucky for not having to suffer at his hand, she still stood by him throughout all his faults (\"Heart of Stone\").\n\nThe story then shifts as the Queens are suddenly turned into members of [[Hans Holbein the Younger|Hans Holbein]]'s painting studio, talking about how they make the women he paints look beautiful for their portraits (\"Haus of Holbein\"). In a set-up parodying [[Tinder (app)|Tinder]] (or another similar dating site) they present three women: [[Christina of Denmark]], [[Amalia of Cleves]], and [[Anne of Cleves|Anna of Cleves]],{{efn|The character goes by the German spelling, 'Anna', instead of the traditionally anglicised, Anne.}} Amalia's elder sister. When Henry \"swipes right\", so to speak, on Anna, they all assume he will marry Anna and that they will have a happy, long-lasting marriage (\"Haus of Holbein (Playoff)\"). Of course, their union is ultimately ill-fated as he rejects Anna, and she pretends to make a big deal about how she is then forced to live in a beautiful palace in Richmond as a result, though she's not really complaining. She then boasts about her riches and how since she remained unmarried after her divorce, there is no man around to tell her what to do, meaning she is able to do anything she pleases (\"Get Down\"). After the Queens point out how Anna's life doesn't sound that difficult, Anna says \"Oh, well, back to the palace\". As [[Catherine Howard|Katherine Howard]] is next to go, the Queens belittle her for being \"the least relevant Catherine\", but Katherine retaliates by mentioning flaws in the other Queens' reasons for winning, such as how Anne Boleyn wasn't the only beheaded wife and how Jane Seymour only died due to natural causes. She then recounts her life and the men who abused her, leading into her marriage to Henry as she breaks down, fully realizing the trauma she suffered from her relationships and how these \"all-powerful men\" led to her eventual beheading (\"All You Wanna Do\").\n\nAs the Queens continue to squabble about who should win the contest, a frustrated [[Catherine Parr]] puts a stop to it. Questioning the point of it all, she brings up the fact that they're remembered solely by their shared connection to Henry, not as individuals. When they refuse to listen, claiming she has no story to tell that involves Henry, Parr tells her story, and of the accomplishments she made independently of Henry (\"I Don't Need Your Love\"). The other Queens, realising that they've let themselves be defined by Henry for so long, stop the contest and declare that they don't need his love to feel validated as people (\"I Don't Need Your Love (Remix)\"). With only five minutes left in the show after the fact, they decide to use their remaining moments on stage to \"rewrite\" the stories they told and sing for themselves for a change, singing together as a group rather than as solo artists and writing their own [[Happy ending|happily ever after]] (\"Six\").\n\nIn all of the live performances of the show as of July 2018, the Queens perform an encore number that is not featured on the Original Cast Recording, which is a mashup of all the songs performed in the show (minus \"Haus of Holbein\") called \"Megasix\". The audience is encouraged by the Queens to film this portion of the performance \u2013 the exception is on all USA engagements of ''Six'' after the Chicago premiere due to union rules.\n\n==Musical numbers==\n\n* \"Ex-Wives\" \u2013 The Queens\n* \"Ex-Wives (Reprise/Playoff)\" \u2013 The Queens \u2020\n* \"No Way\" \u2013 Catherine of Aragon and Ensemble\n* \"Anne Boleyn (Interlude)\" \u2013 The Queens \u2020\n* \"Don't Lose Ur Head\" \u2013 Anne Boleyn and Ensemble \n* \"Heart of Stone\" \u2013 Jane Seymour and Ensemble  \n* \"Haus of Holbein\" \u2013 Company\n* \"Haus of Holbein (Playoff)\" \u2013 Company \u2020\n* \"Get Down\" \u2013 Anna of Cleves and Ensemble \n* \"All You Wanna Do\" \u2013 Katherine Howard and Ensemble \n* \"I Don't Need Your Love\" \u2013 Catherine Parr\n* \"I Don't Need Your Love (Remix)\" \u2013 Catherine Parr and the Queens \u2020\u2020\n* \"Six\" \u2013 The Queens\n* \"Megasix\" \u2013 The Queens \u2020\n\n\u2020 Not included on the Studio Cast Recording.<br />\n\u2020\u2020 Included as part of \"I Don't Need Your Love\" on the Studio Cast Recording.\n\n== Productions ==\n=== Writing and Edinburgh Fringe ===\nThe idea for the musical came to Toby Marlow while studying in his final year at Cambridge University, and despite uncertainties from collaborator Lucy Moss, the pair wrote part of the show while studying for their final exams.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thejc.com/culture/theatre/six-the-musical-steps-from-fringe-to-the-west-end-1.469323|title=We wrote a musical during our finals...now it's on in the West End|website= The JC|access-date=2018-11-06}}</ref> Marlow had been selected in late 2016 by Cambridge University Arts Society to write a new musical to be performed at the [[Edinburgh Fringe]], and the initial six wives' concert concept came to him later during a poetry class when he decided to get his friend Moss involved.

Upon further investigation, the rap trio and 12 members of their entourage were arrested for possession of marijuana and another Schedule II controlled substance, possession of firearms within a school safety zone, possession of firearms during the commission of a crime, and possession of firearms by convicted felons.<ref name=\"S'boro Herald\">{{cite web|title=Migos rap group members arrested at Hanner show|url=http://www.statesboroherald.com/section/1/article/67214/|publisher=Statesboro Herald|access-date=April 20, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150427110959/http://www.statesboroherald.com/section/1/article/67214/|archive-date=April 27, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=\"George-Anne\">{{cite web|last1=Gorla|first1=Lauren|title=Migos arrested following delayed Spring Concert|url=http://www.thegeorgeanne.com/news/article_ab86f90c-e7bd-11e4-9c47-abc8c27a3824.html|publisher=The George-Anne|access-date=April 22, 2015}}</ref>\n\nWhile university officials had been aware of Migos' reputation, the group was allowed to perform, as it had received the most votes among the seven bands and artists up for consideration for the Spring concert in a student poll, and student fees and ticket sales had been used to pay for the concert.<ref name=\"S'boro Herald 2\">{{cite web|last1=Saxon|first1=Holli|title=Two Migos rappers post bond; one held in jail|url=http://www.statesboroherald.com/section/1/article/67224/|publisher=Statesboro Herald|access-date=April 21, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150427143531/http://www.statesboroherald.com/section/1/article/67224/|archive-date=April 27, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> According to the performance contract, the group were to be paid $30,000 with their promoter Big House Collective receiving an additional $3,000.

Although their performance contract stipulated a minimum 45 minute set length, the group performed for less than 30 minutes before leaving the stage. The University Police Department, the Statesboro Police Department and the [[Bulloch County, Georgia|Bulloch County]] Sheriff's Office, who were present at the concert as security detail, detected a strong scent of marijuana from the group's vans, and the drivers were questioned by law enforcement. Upon further investigation, the rap trio and 12 members of their entourage were arrested for possession of marijuana and another Schedule II controlled substance, possession of firearms within a school safety zone, possession of firearms during the commission of a crime, and possession of firearms by convicted felons.<ref name=\"S'boro Herald\">{{cite web|title=Migos rap group members arrested at Hanner show|url=http://www.statesboroherald.com/section/1/article/67214/|publisher=Statesboro Herald|access-date=April 20, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150427110959/http://www.statesboroherald.com/section/1/article/67214/|archive-date=April 27, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=\"George-Anne\">{{cite web|last1=Gorla|first1=Lauren|title=Migos arrested following delayed Spring Concert|url=http://www.thegeorgeanne.com/news/article_ab86f90c-e7bd-11e4-9c47-abc8c27a3824.html|publisher=The George-Anne|access-date=April 22, 2015}}</ref>\n\nWhile university officials had been aware of Migos' reputation, the group was allowed to perform, as it had received the most votes among the seven bands and artists up for consideration for the Spring concert in a student poll, and student fees and ticket sales had been used to pay for the concert.<ref name=\"S'boro Herald 2\">{{cite web|last1=Saxon|first1=Holli|title=Two Migos rappers post bond; one held in jail|url=http://www.statesboroherald.com/section/1/article/67224/|publisher=Statesboro Herald|access-date=April 21, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150427143531/http://www.statesboroherald.com/section/1/article/67224/|archive-date=April 27, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> According to the performance contract, the group were to be paid $30,000 with their promoter Big House Collective receiving an additional $3,000.

Between 1830 and 1836, Hoddle made several visits to the rural district now occupied by the [[Australian Capital Territory]] (A.C.T.), where he surveyed property boundaries.  Squatters were urgently pressing for government surveyors to legalise their rural holdings.

Whether Hoddle started to survey from scratch or used Russell's initial survey had been a subject of controversy, but they both followed the then standard grid layout and alignment.  Hoddle's survey, a copy of which survives in the Public Record Office of Victoria, is dated 25 March 1837, and covered the area from [[Flinders Street, Melbourne|Flinders Street]] to [[Lonsdale Street, Melbourne|Lonsdale Street]], and from [[Spencer Street, Melbourne|Spencer Street]] to [[Spring Street, Melbourne|Spring Street]]. The principal streets were one and a half chains wide (30 m), and at the insistence of Bourke, smaller east-west streets a half chain wide (10 m) were inserted, intended to furnish back entrances (but quickly became frontages in their own right). This layout of came to be known as the [[Hoddle Grid]].\n\nIn 1837, at the same time as Melbourne, Hoddle laid out the first blocks of [[Williamstown, Victoria|Williamstown]], but without rear laneways. In 1838 he laid out [[Geelong]], including narrow laneways as in the Melbourne grid. His layouts for each were typical of the time, being square or rectangular grids, aligned with features such as rivers or waterfront, surrounded by government reserve for future expansion, government buildings, ports and the like.\n\nHoddle subdivided the land beyond the angled city grid on a one mile north-south grid, creating much larger allotments. The areas closest to the city in what is now [[Fitzroy, Victoria|Fitzroy]], [[Collingwood, Victoria|Collingwood]] and [[Richmond, Victoria|Richmond]], were soon subdivided by speculators creating the sometimes quite narrow streets and irregular grid pattern. Hoddle's subdivision of [[East Melbourne]] was far more regular.\n\nHoddle was in favour of the principal entry streets being a generous width of 60m, which he applied to what are now Melbourne's tree-lined boulevards, such as [[St. Kilda Road]], [[Victoria Street, Melbourne|Victoria]] Parade, [[Elizabeth Street, Melbourne|Elizabeth Street]] in Carlton, and the roads branching off that; Royal Parade and Flemington Road. He advocated widening the other existing major roads without success. In 1853 he was gently asked to retire in favour of Andrew Young, who is credited with the subdivisions of Carlton, North Fitzroy, and South Geelong that include formal parks, squares and crescents.\n\n===Artist in ink and watercolours===\nRobert Hoddle is the earliest-known European artist to have depicted the A.C.T. area. Many of his works are held in the [[National Library of Australia]], [[State Library of Victoria]] and the [[State Library of New South Wales]]. <!-- Some of his works were offered for sale in a [[South Yarra, Victoria|South Yarra]] gallery in October 2004 and May 2005. -->\n\nSome of the paintings he made during this time are held at the National Library of Australia.

However, after a few months holiday he recovered his health, took up his duties again, and the gratuity was not paid to him. He later did valuable work in the country districts of Victoria, became [[Surveyor General of Victoria]] in 1851, and retired in July 1853 with a pension of \u00a31000 a year. He had bought in 1837 the block of land in Elizabeth Street, Melbourne, on which the [[Commonwealth Bank of Australia]] now stands, for a comparatively small sum, and he became a wealthy man. After his retirement he took an interest in the Old Colonists' Association<ref name=adb/> and was elected a life governor in December 1873.\n\n===Personal life===\nHe was married twice and left a widow and children.<ref name=thwc02>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article138597354 |title=THE HODDLE WILL CASE. |newspaper=[[The Australasian]] |volume=LVII |issue=1480 |location=Victoria, Australia |date=11 August 1894 |accessdate=13 February 2017 |page=24 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref><ref name=thwc01>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article150365571 |title=THE HODDLE WILL CASE. |newspaper=[[Geelong Advertiser]] |issue=14,729 |location=Victoria, Australia |date=18 May 1894 |accessdate=13 February 2017 |page=2 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref><ref name=adw01>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article197460923 |title=ANOTHER DISPUTED WILL. |newspaper=[[The Age]] |issue=12,307 |location=Victoria, Australia |date=8 August 1894 |accessdate=13 February 2017 |page=9 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref><ref name=adw02>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article197461373 |title=A DISPUTED WILL. |newspaper=[[The Age]] |issue=12,237 |location=Victoria, Australia |date=18 May 1894 |accessdate=13 February 2017 |page=5 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\n===Death===\nHe died at his residence on the north east corner of Bourke and Spencer Street, a lot he bought at one of the first land sales, on 24 October 1881.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article5987936 |title=TUESDAY, OCTOBER 25, 1881. |newspaper=[[The Argus (Melbourne)]] |issue=11,030 |location=Victoria, Australia |date=25 October 1881 |accessdate=13 February 2017 |page=7 |via=National Library of Australia}}, ''...Our obituary to-day contains the name of Mr. Robt.

Between 1830 and 1836, Hoddle made several visits to the rural district now occupied by the [[Australian Capital Territory]] (A.C.T.), where he surveyed property boundaries.  Squatters were urgently pressing for government surveyors to legalise their rural holdings.

Whether Hoddle started to survey from scratch or used Russell's initial survey had been a subject of controversy, but they both followed the then standard grid layout and alignment.  Hoddle's survey, a copy of which survives in the Public Record Office of Victoria, is dated 25 March 1837, and covered the area from [[Flinders Street, Melbourne|Flinders Street]] to [[Lonsdale Street, Melbourne|Lonsdale Street]], and from [[Spencer Street, Melbourne|Spencer Street]] to [[Spring Street, Melbourne|Spring Street]]. The principal streets were one and a half chains wide (30 m), and at the insistence of Bourke, smaller east-west streets a half chain wide (10 m) were inserted, intended to furnish back entrances (but quickly became frontages in their own right). This layout of came to be known as the [[Hoddle Grid]].\n\nIn 1837, at the same time as Melbourne, Hoddle laid out the first blocks of [[Williamstown, Victoria|Williamstown]], but without rear laneways. In 1838 he laid out [[Geelong]], including narrow laneways as in the Melbourne grid. His layouts for each were typical of the time, being square or rectangular grids, aligned with features such as rivers or waterfront, surrounded by government reserve for future expansion, government buildings, ports and the like.\n\nHoddle subdivided the land beyond the angled city grid on a one mile north-south grid, creating much larger allotments. The areas closest to the city in what is now [[Fitzroy, Victoria|Fitzroy]], [[Collingwood, Victoria|Collingwood]] and [[Richmond, Victoria|Richmond]], were soon subdivided by speculators creating the sometimes quite narrow streets and irregular grid pattern. Hoddle's subdivision of [[East Melbourne]] was far more regular.\n\nHoddle was in favour of the principal entry streets being a generous width of 60m, which he applied to what are now Melbourne's tree-lined boulevards, such as [[St. Kilda Road]], [[Victoria Street, Melbourne|Victoria]] Parade, [[Elizabeth Street, Melbourne|Elizabeth Street]] in Carlton, and the roads branching off that; Royal Parade and Flemington Road. He advocated widening the other existing major roads without success. In 1853 he was gently asked to retire in favour of Andrew Young, who is credited with the subdivisions of Carlton, North Fitzroy, and South Geelong that include formal parks, squares and crescents.\n\n===Artist in ink and watercolours===\nRobert Hoddle is the earliest-known European artist to have depicted the A.C.T. area. Many of his works are held in the [[National Library of Australia]], [[State Library of Victoria]] and the [[State Library of New South Wales]]. <!-- Some of his works were offered for sale in a [[South Yarra, Victoria|South Yarra]] gallery in October 2004 and May 2005. -->\n\nSome of the paintings he made during this time are held at the National Library of Australia. They include:\n*[http://nla.gov.au/nla.pic-vn3423118 Ginninginderry, i.e. Ginninderra, Plains, New South Wales; watercolour]\n*[http://nla.gov.au/nla.pic-an5380512 Ginninginderry, i.e. Ginninderra, Plains; watercolour]\n\nAdditional works by Hoddle include:\n*[http://nla.gov.au/nla.pic-vn3289506 View from Limestone Hill called Campbells Hill, New South Wales, March 1832; watercolour]\n*[http://nla.gov.au/nla.pic-vn3289513 The seven day's in the Week's Occupation of the Australians, hunting, 1835; ink wash]\n*[http://nla.gov.au/nla.pic-vn3289504 Unidentified coastal landscape, New South Wales, 1; watercolour]\n*[http://nla.gov.au/nla.pic-vn3289503 Unidentified coastal landscape, New South Wales, 2; watercolour]\n*[http://nla.gov.au/nla.pic-vn3289510 View from Illawarra Range en route to Kiama, 1830; watercolour]\n\n===Later life===\n[[William Lonsdale (colonist)|William Lonsdale]] appointed Hoddle as auctioneer at the first sale of crown land on 1 June 1837, at which he sold half-acre (0.2 ha) allotments for \u00a318 to \u00a378, considered at the time a very high price.<ref>{{cite Australasia |Hoddle, Robert}}</ref> Hoddle's commission was \u00a357 12s. 7d., from which he bought two allotments for himself at a cost of \u00a354.<ref name=adb/> Hoddle built himself a house on the corner of [[Bourke Street, Melbourne|Bourke]] and [[Spencer Street, Melbourne|Spencer]] Streets where, in retirement, he tended his trees, played organ and flute and translated Spanish.\n\nIn 1840, Hoddle was granted a gratuity of \u00a3500 as he was leaving the survey department on account of ill-health. However, after a few months holiday he recovered his health, took up his duties again, and the gratuity was not paid to him. He later did valuable work in the country districts of Victoria, became [[Surveyor General of Victoria]] in 1851, and retired in July 1853 with a pension of \u00a31000 a year. He had bought in 1837 the block of land in Elizabeth Street, Melbourne, on which the [[Commonwealth Bank of Australia]] now stands, for a comparatively small sum, and he became a wealthy man. After his retirement he took an interest in the Old Colonists' Association<ref name=adb/> and was elected a life governor in December 1873.\n\n===Personal life===\nHe was married twice and left a widow and children.<ref name=thwc02>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article138597354 |title=THE HODDLE WILL CASE. |newspaper=[[The Australasian]] |volume=LVII |issue=1480 |location=Victoria, Australia |date=11 August 1894 |accessdate=13 February 2017 |page=24 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref><ref name=thwc01>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article150365571 |title=THE HODDLE WILL CASE. |newspaper=[[Geelong Advertiser]] |issue=14,729 |location=Victoria, Australia |date=18 May 1894 |accessdate=13 February 2017 |page=2 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref><ref name=adw01>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article197460923 |title=ANOTHER DISPUTED WILL. |newspaper=[[The Age]] |issue=12,307 |location=Victoria, Australia |date=8 August 1894 |accessdate=13 February 2017 |page=9 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref><ref name=adw02>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article197461373 |title=A DISPUTED WILL. |newspaper=[[The Age]] |issue=12,237 |location=Victoria, Australia |date=18 May 1894 |accessdate=13 February 2017 |page=5 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\n===Death===\nHe died at his residence on the north east corner of Bourke and Spencer Street, a lot he bought at one of the first land sales, on 24 October 1881.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article5987936 |title=TUESDAY, OCTOBER 25, 1881. |newspaper=[[The Argus (Melbourne)]] |issue=11,030 |location=Victoria, Australia |date=25 October 1881 |accessdate=13 February 2017 |page=7 |via=National Library of Australia}}, ''...Our obituary to-day contains the name of Mr. Robt.

Snooker was in decline during his youth, and he did not turn professional until the age of 31, when interest in the sport was starting to revive. Spencer was runner-up to [[Ray Reardon]] in the 1964 English Amateur Snooker Championship (the first tournament he ever entered) and lost to [[Pat Houlihan]] in the final of the 1965 event. Spencer finally lifted the trophy in 1966 with an 11\u20135 victory over Marcus Owen.<ref name=\"guinness\">{{cite book |last=Everton |first=Clive |title=Guinness Book of Billiards and Snooker |date=1982 |publisher=Guinness World Records Limited |isbn=0851122566}}</ref>{{rp|116}}\n\nIn February 1967, Spencer made the bold decision to turn professional. At this time there were effectively no officially organized professional tournaments and no player in the UK had turned professional since [[Rex Williams]] in 1951.<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Billiards and Snooker'', March 1969, No. 553, p.11. The article here is surprisingly small and may explain the very rare error in Everton's ''Guinness Book of Snooker'', where he states Gary Owen was the first professional since 1967 (see 1982 edition, p.76).</ref> This proved to be a very important step in re-establishing snooker as a viable sport, with amateur rivals [[Gary Owen (snooker player)|Gary Owen]] following suit in September 1967<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Billiards and Snooker'', Oct 1967, No. 560, p.5.</ref> and Ray Reardon on December 3 of that year.<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Billiards and Snooker'', Dec 1967, No. 562, p.4.</ref> This influx of new professionals led to the World Championship being revived on a challenge basis in the 1968/9 season.\n\nHe first won the [[World Snooker Championship|World Championship]] in 1969 after being loaned \u00a3100 by his bank to raise the entry fee. On 22 November 1968, Spencer defeated reigning world champion [[John Pulman]] 25\u201318 in his opening match before going on to defeat Rex Williams 37\u201312<ref>With all frames played Spencer won by the even greater margin of 55\u201318; see ''Billiards and Snooker'', No. 577, p.3.</ref> and [[Gary Owen (snooker player)|Gary Owen]] 37\u201324 in the final, held at Victoria Hall in London from 17 to 22 March.<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Billiards and Snooker'', No. 577, March 1969, p.3.</ref> 'Dead' frames were then played out to give a final frame tally of 46\u201327 to Spencer, who (with additional bonuses) took \u00a31,780 from the event.<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Billiards and Snooker'', April 1969, No. 578 p.6</ref> He thus became the only player to win the World Championship at his first attempt since [[Joe Davis]] won the inaugural championship in 1927 (the feat was emulated by [[Alex Higgins]] in 1972 and by [[Terry Griffiths]] in 1979).<ref name=\"guinness\" />{{rp|89}}\n\nIn the April 1970 World Championship, Spencer beat veteran Irish Professional Champion [[Jackie Rea]] 31\u201315, but lost his semi-final on a poor quality table to Ray Reardon 33\u201337 who went on to claim his first title.<ref name=\"guinness\" />{{rp|89}} Oddly, the de facto 1971 championship was held in November 1970 and played in [[Australia]]. Following an incomplete [[Round-robin tournament|round-robin]] Spencer thrashed Reardon 34\u201315 in the semi-final before defeating [[Warren Simpson]] in the final 37\u201329.<ref name=\"guinness\"/> During the final Spencer made three centuries in four frames (105, 126 and 107), the first time this had been achieved in the championship.<ref name=\"spenceronsnooker\">{{cite book |last=Spencer |first=John |title=Spencer on Snooker |publisher=Cassell |date=1978}}</ref>{{rp|9}}\n\nSpencer gained important TV exposure by winning [[BBC]] TV's ''[[Pot Black]]'' series in 1970 (reversing his defeat by Ray Reardon in the 1969 final) and again in 1971 when he beat [[Fred Davis (snooker player)|Fred Davis]] in the final. Spencer also claimed the highest break prize in 1972, he was runner-up in 1974, and won the event again in 1976 (beating [[Dennis Taylor]] in the final), thus becoming the first three-time winner.<ref>{{cite book |editor-last=Perrin |editor-first=Reg |title=Pot Black |publisher=BBC Books |page=22}}</ref>\n\nIn 1971 and 1972, four events sponsored by Park Drive (the [[Park Drive 2000]]) were held where each of the four players involved played nine matches, the top two placed professionals playing a final match. Spencer won three of these events and lost the fourth only 3\u20134<ref name=\"guinness\" />{{rp|90}} in the final to Ray Reardon with whom he battled for supremacy throughout the 1970s as snooker emerged from a phase of obscurity to become one of Britain's most popular sports. From 1969 to 1978, only three players defeated Spencer in the World Championship (Ray Reardon, Alex Higgins and Perrie Mans) and from 1973 to 1977 he did not lose a World Championship match by more than two frames.\n\n==== 1972 World Championship ====\n\nPivotal in the rise of snooker as one of Britain's most popular sports was the 1972 World Championship final. As defending champion in the 1972 event, Spencer beat [[Fred Davis (snooker player)|Fred Davis]] 31\u201321 and [[Eddie Charlton]] 37\u201332, before facing championship debutant [[Alex Higgins]] in the final. The week-long final was fairly balanced until the Thursday evening session which Higgins won 6\u20130, creating a gap Spencer never looked like closing. Higgins duly went on to take the match 37\u201332.<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Snooker Scene'', April 1972, p.4.</ref> The match, played at the British Legion Club in [[Selly Oak]], Birmingham, often with emergency generators providing the lighting and with hundreds of spectators crammed in, many sat on beer crates, provided the crucial spark of interest in the modern era. Higgins was already generating much interest in the sport and had been the subject of a documentary by Thames TV ahead of the final.<ref name=\"higgins\">{{cite book |last=Higgins |first=Alex |authorlink=Alex Higgins |date=2007 |title=My Story: From the Eye of the Hurricane |publisher=Headline |page=56}}</ref>\n\nSpencer made no excuses for his defeat, despite being exhausted and ill from a major tour of Canada, trapped in a lift ahead of one of the sessions, and involved in a minor car crash on the way to another session. He had also expended effort in beating Higgins 4\u20133 in the final of the [[Park Drive 2000]] event the night before their final commenced.<ref>{{cite book |last=Everton |first=Clive |title=Black Farce and Cue Ball Wizards |publisher=Mainstream |date=2007 |pages=48\u201349}}</ref> In his 2005 memoir, Spencer made clear that Higgins had played the better snooker and won the match 'fair and square'.<ref name=\"blue\">{{cite book |last=Spencer |first=John |title=Out of the Blue into the Black |publisher=Parrs Wood Press |date=2005}}</ref>{{rp|74}} Curiously, Higgins used this exact expression when discussing his victory in his memoir two years later.<ref name=\"higgins\" />{{rp|56}} Spencer was also quick to admit that Higgins' win brought in more sponsorship, more promotions, better organisation and more media interest.<ref name=\"spenceronsnooker\" />{{rp|10}}\n\nSpencer went on to win one further world title, which was the historic inaugural event at the [[Crucible Theatre]] in [[Sheffield]] in 1977. He never reached the top of the world rankings, however, always being eclipsed by his rival, Reardon. Spencer played down talk of a friendship between himself and Reardon and stated that they never socialised together.<ref name=\"blue\" />{{rp|106}} However, Spencer and Reardon paired up for the first two World Doubles events.

Spencer won the event both times it was held beating Alex Higgins 8\u20132 (in the semi-final) and John Pulman 8\u20137 (in the final) to win the 1973 event and beating Cliff Thorburn 9\u20137 (in the semi-finals) and Ray Reardon 10\u20139 (in the final) to win the 1974 event. This latter victory was even more notable given that his cue had been broken into four pieces ten days before the 1974 event and he had to have it pieced back together.<ref>Spencer, John, ''Spencer on Snooker'', Cassell, Second Edition, 1978, p.10, although Spencer listed the date as 1973 in his 2005 book, ''Out of the Blue into the Black'', see p.75, but photos of the broken cue appear in the February 1975 edition of ''Snooker Scene'' (p. 13).</ref> Spencer was runner-up in both inaugural Pontins events, first held in 1974. He lost the Open (conceding 25) to Doug Mountjoy 4\u20137 and the Professional event 9\u201310 to Ray Reardon (after Spencer had trailed 4\u20139).<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Snooker Scene'', July 1974, p.9.</ref> He also won a minor tournament at the end of 1974, the Jackpot Automatics tournament, beating Alex Higgins 5\u20130 in the final.<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Snooker Scene'', December 1974, p.20.</ref>\n\nA sign of growing interest in snooker's resurgence came when [[Ladbrokes]] held a gala evening towards the end of 1973 to celebrate its \u00a38,000 investment into the sport in the 1973\u201374 season. The gala evening event (held at the Cafe Royal) saw Spencer take first prize with a 3\u20132 win over [[Ray Edmonds]].<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Snooker Scene'', December 1973, p.9.</ref>\n\nSpencer's good form was not to be translated into positive results at the 1973 and 1974 World Championships. Arguably his most disappointing career loss was his 22\u201323 defeat by Ray Reardon in the 1973 World Championship semi-final, after leading 16\u20139 and 19\u201312. Prior to this, Spencer had shown decisive form in defeating [[David Taylor (snooker player)|David Taylor]] 16\u20135 and Rex Williams 16\u20137. In the final, Reardon defeated Eddie Charlton, a player to whom Spencer would not lose in a major match until 1979.<ref name=\"guinness\" />{{rp|91}}\n\nIn 1974, he lost 13\u201315 to [[Perrie Mans]] in the second round. Spencer refused to blame the defeat on a dose of flu from which he had been suffering (and Mans did indeed defeat Spencer again in the 1978 event). Spencer's only consolation was a plate competition for first and second round losers where he easily crushed his opponents, notching up six centuries in defeating David Greaves 5\u20131, [[Dennis Taylor]] 9\u20134, [[Jim Meadowcroft]] 9\u20133 and John Pulman 15\u20135 in the final.<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Snooker Scene'', June 1974, pp. 9 & 18.</ref>\n\nIn 1975, Spencer won the inaugural Masters event held at [[Fulham]]'s West Centre Hotel. He defeated John Pulman (5\u20133), [[Eddie Charlton]] (5\u20132) and overcame Ray Reardon in the closest of finals.<ref name=\"guinness\" />{{rp|92}} Spencer trailed 6\u20138, but leveled at 8\u20138 and took the final frame on a re-spotted Black.<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Snooker Scene'', February 1975, p.7.</ref> In the spring, he won the invitational Ashton Court Country Club event (and took the highest break prize) by defeating Alex Higgins 5\u20131 in front of a sell out crowd in the final.<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Snooker Scene'', May 1975, p.5.</ref> Spencer lost 2\u20135 to Higgins in the final of the Castle Open pro-am at the end of the year.<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Snooker Scene'', February 1976, p.9.</ref>\n\nSpencer again faced disappointment at the 1975 World Championship, in a somewhat controversial manner. With the tournament being staged in [[Australia]] and organised by Eddie Charlton, Spencer found himself in a half of the draw which featured both Ray Reardon and Alex Higgins, meaning that all the champions since 1969 were in the same half of the draw. Still worse, the organisational seedings placed Spencer at 8, meaning that he met Reardon in the quarter-final. Despite opening up with two centuries in the first four frames and leading 17\u201316, with the scars of their epic 1973 semi-final still fresh, the match slipped away from Spencer 17\u201319. At the time, both Reardon and Spencer stated boldly that it was the greatest match yet played.<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Snooker Scene'', June 1975, p.5.</ref>\n\nThe following year, the 1976 World Championship saw an even narrower defeat for Spencer at the same stage. Having defeated David Taylor 15\u20135, and claiming the highest break prize in the process,<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Snooker Scene'', May 1976, p.15. The break was 138 and the prize \u00a3200.</ref> he lost to Alex Higgins in the quarter-final 14\u201315, having trailed 12\u201314. The quality of the match was a pale shadow of their 1972 encounter.<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Snooker Scene''. June 1976, p.15.</ref>\n\nA minor consolation came when Spencer won the [[1976 Canadian Open]] that year, defeating [[John Virgo]] 9\u20134 in the semi-final and Alex Higgins 17\u20139 in the final to claim the $5,000 prize.<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Snooker Scene'', November 1976, pp. 14\u201316.</ref>\n\n=== Final World Championship victory and other titles ===\n\nSpencer returned to win his third world title in 1977, the first world championship to be held at the Crucible Theatre where it has remained ever since. Seeded 8, Spencer defeated John Virgo 13\u20139 (having trailed 1\u20134), Ray Reardon 13\u20136, a resurgent John Pulman 18\u201316, and finally Cliff Thorburn 25\u201321 (having trailed 11\u201315) in the final. Spencer won \u00a36,000 for his victory. He followed this up by winning the [[1977 Pontins Professional|Pontins Professional]] title a week later, defeating John Pulman 7\u20135 in the final to win another \u00a31,500.<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Snooker Scene'', June 1977, pp. 14\u201324.</ref> Spencer's World Championship victory in 1977 was the last time that he seriously challenged for the world title; he never again reached even the quarter-finals of any future World Championship.\n\nSpencer reached the final of the [[1977 Canadian Open|Canadian Open]] again in 1977, where he lost to Higgins 14\u201317.<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Snooker Scene'', October 1977, p.15.</ref> This event was played in a circus tent, with a traditional circus situated next to the event. Conditions were so hot that Spencer's chalk snapped in half upon using it due to accumulated dampness in his pocket.<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Snooker Scene'', October 1977, p.14.</ref>\n\nIn the spring of 1978 Spencer won the very first [[1978 Irish Masters|Irish Masters]] by beating [[Doug Mountjoy]] 5\u20133 in the final at Goffs Sales Room. Spencer took \u00a31,000, but the event was so successful it brought in around \u00a33,300 in [[gate receipts]].<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Snooker Scene'', May 1978, p.17.</ref> Prior to this, Spencer had won a precursor to this event in Ireland, held at the National Boxing Stadium. In 1975, he beat Alex Higgins in a one off match and then beat Higgins again in the final of a four-man event held in 1976.<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Snooker Scene'', April 1976, p.15. Spencer stated that the [[Waterford Crystal]] trophy he received was the only one he still possessed as of 2005. Spencer, John, ''Out of the Blue into the Black'', Parrs Wood Press, p.76.</ref> Spencer's good form continued when he beat [[Tony Knowles (snooker player)|Tony Knowles]] 7\u20134 in the final of the 1978 Warners Open. Despite conceding 21 points per frame, Spencer did not even drop a frame until the final.<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Snooker Scene'', July 1978, p.9.</ref> Spencer was undefeated in the group stages of the Pontins Professional tournament that year, winning all five of his matches, but he lost 2\u20137 to Ray Reardon in the final.<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Snooker Scene'', June 1978, p.20.</ref>\n\nSpencer warmed up for the 1978 World Championship by winning the Castle Professional event, defeating Alex higgins 5\u20133 in the final.<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Snooker Scene'', May 1978, p.22.</ref> However, he lost his opening match in the World Championship to Perrie Mans by 8\u201313, a result which had looked unlikely when a break of 118 had given him a 3\u20131 lead. Spencer began the final session with a 138 break, which would prove to be the highest of the championship, but did not win another frame. The break at least doubled his prize money to \u00a31,000.<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Snooker Scene'', June 1978, p.11.</ref>\n\n===First unofficial 147 break in a tournament===\nIn January 1979 at the [[1979 Holsten Lager International|Holsten Lager International]], Spencer compiled the first ever 147 maximum break in tournament play. He was playing Cliff Thorburn in the quarter-final and won the first three frames of their encounter 106\u20131, 147\u20130 and 119\u20130. Spencer could not resist giving the excited spectators a shock by lunging forward and hitting over the cue ball in his initial address, before potting the final black. [[Thames Television]] were resting their TV crew at the time following the previous match between Alex Higgins and [[David Taylor (snooker player)|David Taylor]] and so missed the historic moment. This did not count as an official maximum break as the event used non templated tables, so it remains an unofficial maximum break. Spencer went on to win the tournament, beating Rex Williams 6\u20132 in the semi-final and [[Graham Miles]] 11\u20137 in the final. The sponsors awarded Spencer an extra \u00a3500 for the break in addition to his \u00a33,500 first prize.<ref>Everton, Clive, ''Snooker Scene''. February 1979, pp.12\u201315. The figure is given as \u00a350 in ''Out of the Blue in the Black'', see p.79.</ref> Three years later on 11 January 1982, Spencer was [[Steve Davis]]'s opponent when Davis made the first televised [[Maximum break|147]] at the [[Classic (snooker)|Lada Classic]] tournament at the Queen Elizabeth Hall, [[Oldham]]. This occurred in the fifth frame of their quarter-final match when the scores had been poised at two frames each.<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Snooker Scene'', February 1982, p.5.</ref>\n\nTwo months after Spencer's 147 he won the biggest tournament that India had yet staged when he won the Garware Paints Invitational event in [[Bombay]]. Spencer beat India's Arvind Savur 6\u20131, [[Patsy Fagan]] 6\u20134, Graham Miles 6\u20135 and Cliff Thorburn 6\u20133 to take the \u00a32,000 first prize and another \u00a3200 for the highest break (108) and also claimed the 'Man of the Series' award.<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Snooker Scene'', April 1979, p.16.</ref> In the same event the following year, Spencer remained undefeated in his group matches, before his semi-final loss to John Virgo. These matches included a 6\u20134 victory over Steve Davis (who won the UK title later that year).<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Snooker Scene'', February 1981, p.7.</ref> Although Spencer would run Davis close in future years, this was his only victory over Davis in a recognised event.\n\nSpencer reached the semi-final of the [[1979 Irish Masters|Irish Masters]] in 1979, losing just 2\u20133 to Ray Reardon, having made the highest break of the tournament (121) at the group stage. Spencer was also runner-up to Reardon in the 1979 Forward Chemicals event, the final of this extended event (which duplicated the old Park Drive 2000 format) was played in front of 680 people at the Royal Exchange Theatre in Manchester. Spencer lost 6\u20139, and took \u00a32,300.<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Snooker Scene'', March 1979, p.13.</ref> Later that year, Spencer lost 1\u20134 to Steve Davis in the semi-final of the Pontins Open event.<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Snooker Scene'', June 1979, p.23.</ref>\n\nIn January 1980, Spencer won \u00a33,000 (a record for a two-day event) at the Wilson's Classic.<ref name=\"guinness\" />{{rp|100}} Broadcast by [[Granada TV]], the final contained another notorious push-shot incident adjudged against Spencer's opponent Alex Higgins.<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Snooker Scene'', February 1980 pp.16\u201317. See also https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZW6VxHK-hY</ref> Higgins received a \u00a3200 fine for his reaction to Jim Thorpe's controversial decision.<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Snooker Scene'', March 1980, p.21.</ref> Spencer also won the Winfield Australian Masters in 1980, beating Dennis Taylor in the final.<ref name=\"blue\" />{{rp|80\u201381}} This was Spencer's last professional solo tournament victory (he was runner-up in the 1981 event).\n\nIn February 1981 in the John Courage English Professional Championship, after a 9\u20131 first round victory over Pat Houlihan, Spencer led Steve Davis 7\u20136 in the quarter-final, having notched in a break of 112. However, Spencer lost three tight frames to lose the match 7\u20139. Davis lost just five frames in his other 3 matches combined.<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Snooker Scene'', April 1981, pp.22\u201328.</ref>\n\nLater in that same year, Spencer joined [[Steve Davis]] and David Taylor to become the first English team to win the World Team Classic. Spencer crucially defeated [[Terry Griffiths]] with the aid of a hard-fought 103 break (he was unable to pot the black during the entire break) in the final, Griffiths having not lost a match in the tournament up to that stage. Davis then secured victory against Ray Reardon in the tie-break to secure the title and \u00a312,000.<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Snooker Scene'', December 1981, p.11.</ref>\n\nSuch a victory only partially made up for Spencer's great disappointment at the 1981 Masters event. Having dispatched Dennis Taylor 5\u20132 and Ray Reardon 5\u20131, Spencer led Terry Griffiths 5\u20132 with Griffiths needing two snookers in the next frame. However, Griffiths managed to recover the match and eventually won by 6\u20135 after almost six hours of play. Spencer thus missed out on a major final with old rival Alex Higgins.<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Snooker Scene'', March 1981, p.11.</ref>\n\nRemarkably, Spencer's 10\u20139 first round victory over [[Ray Edmonds]] at the 1981 World Championship was his first victory in the Championship since his title victory in 1977. Hopes that Spencer might progress further were dashed by an even older adversary, Ray Reardon, who recovered from 0\u20133 and 5\u20137 behind to win the match 13\u201311.<ref>Everton, Clive (Ed.) ''Snooker Scene'', June 1981, pp. 7 & 10/11.</ref> It was to be the last time the two would meet in the World Championship.\n\nPrior to the 1982 World Championship, Spencer beat Alex Higgins (who won the world title a few weeks later) 6\u20130 in the semi-final of the [[1982 Highland Masters]] in [[Inverness]]. Spencer lost 4\u201311 to Ray Reardon in the final, after taking the highest break prize with an effort of 119. The 1982 World Championship itself produced a great many upsets and the loss of the top three seeds in round one. Despite a strong performance in beating [[John Dunning (snooker player)|John Dunning]] 10\u20134 in round one, Spencer could not take advantage of the more open draw and his form fell away badly after holding [[Willie Thorne]] to 3\u20133 in round two. He lost the match 5\u201313.<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Snooker Scene'', June 1982, pp.33, 15 & 20/21.</ref>\n\nAt the end of 1982 Spencer finally won a match in the UK Championship, having lost his first match in every event since the inaugural tournament in 1977. This looked unlikely when his opponent, veteran Scot Eddie Sinclair opened up the deciding frame with a 54 break, but Spencer grabbed a lifeline and saw out the match with a 50 break to win 9\u20138. Spencer then followed this up by eliminating one of the favourites, Tony Knowles 9\u20136, before losing to Alex Higgins 5\u20139 in the quarter-finals.<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Snooker Scene'', January 1983, pp.8\u201315.</ref>\n\n1983 also began very promisingly when Spencer defeated Ray Reardon 5\u20133 and David Taylor 5\u20132 in the Lada Classic. This guaranteed a cheque for \u00a36,000 (the same as he won for winning the 1977 World Championship). In the semi-final, Spencer led Steve Davis 3\u20131, then 4\u20132, and 45\u201329 in the deciding frame, before Davis finally squeezed home, denying Spencer what would have been his highest ever payday.<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Snooker Scene'', February 1983, pp.11\u201316. A finalist was guaranteed \u00a310,000.</ref>\n\nThe 1983 World Championship also ended in disappointment. After seeing off the challenge of 24-year-old [[Mike Hallett]] in round one by 10\u20137, Spencer faced old foe Eddie Charlton in round two. Spencer moved into a 4\u20130 lead, but lost his intensity and despite a break of 106 allowed Charlton to move 12\u20137 ahead. Spencer fought back, but went in-off on the verge of levelling at 12\u201312 and lost the match 11\u201313.<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Snooker Scene'', June 1983, pp.7 & 15.</ref>\n\nImmediately after this Spencer lost narrowly again when he was defeated by [[Tony Meo]], 5\u20134, in the semi-final of the Pontin's event at Brean Sands. An even narrower loss came when Spencer and partner John Virgo lost the doubles event on the final black to Meo and Jimmy White.<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Snooker Scene'', July 1983 pp.10\u201311.</ref>\n\n=== Illness ===\n\nSpencer's later career was blighted by the ocular version of [[myasthenia gravis]] (with symptoms including [[Diplopia|double vision]]). He first noticed something was amiss when he felt unwell at the Pontin's professional tournament in 1984.<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Snooker Scene'', July 1984, p.3. Spencer gives the date as 9 May 1985 and calls the day 'the worst of his life' in his autobiography (p.9); however, ''Snooker Scene'' reported his condition in their July 1984 issue and issued an update on his condition in the September 1984 edition (p.5).</ref> When the news broke in the press of Spencer's condition, he noted that only two players directly sent messages to him. One was Cliff Thorburn, the other was Alex Higgins, who turned up at his house, complete with bottle of Bacardi which Higgins drank as Spencer was not allowed alcohol at this point.<ref name=\"blue\" />{{rp|158}}\n\nWhile the illness affected Spencer late in his career, it robbed him of the modest upturn that had seen him rise to 13th in the 1984/85 rankings.<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Snooker Scene'', July 1984, p.13.</ref> He had also only narrowly failed to capture the Pontin's Professional title that summer when he lost 7\u20139 to Willie Thorne in the final.<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Snooker Scene'', July 1984, p.6.</ref> During the 1984 World Championship he had defeated Graham Miles 10\u20133 in the first round and held top seed Steve Davis to 4\u20136 in round two, before Davis pulled away to win 13\u20135. The Miles match was Spencer's last victory at the Crucible.<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Snooker Scene'', June 1984, pp.5 & 12.</ref>\n\nAlthough Spencer was able to compete in the 1984/85 season, it was clear that the illness was affecting his form. He won only one ranking match during the season when he defeated Canadian Frank Jonik 6\u20130 in the Dulux British Open.<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Snooker Scene'', February 1985, p.23.</ref> There was some cheer when Spencer partnered [[Tony Knowles (snooker player)|Tony Knowles]] to the semi-finals of the World Doubles in December 1984 which gave them a cheque for \u00a311,250.<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Snooker Scene'', February 1985, p.10.</ref> Spencer also marked his final appearance in the Masters with a 5\u20133 win over Eddie Charlton. Although he lost 2\u20135 to [[Jimmy White]] in the quarter-finals, he picked up one of his highest pay cheques of \u00a38,250. Spencer was also part of the England 'B' team in the World Cup (with Jimmy White and Willie Thorne) which reached the semi-finals.<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Snooker Scene'', May 1985, p.9. The semi-finalists received \u00a312,500.</ref> Such outings allowed Spencer to finish within the top 15 money earners for the season.<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Snooker Scene'', July 1985, pp.6\u20137.</ref> Another small consolation came when he narrowly lost in the 1984 final of [[Pot Black]] to [[Terry Griffiths]].<ref name=\"blue\" />{{rp|71}}\n\nA major side effect of Spencer's condition was a susceptibility to eye strain under the bright TV lighting. When he competed in the [[1985 Pontins Professional]] event under ordinary shaded lighting he once again reached the final, losing only 7\u20139 to Terry Griffiths, who Spencer would never defeat in a major singles event.<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Snooker Scene'', July 1985, p.9</ref> It also proved to be his last ever tournament final.\n\nSpencer journeyed to [[Scotland]] ahead of the 1986 World Championship to get in concentrated practice. This paid off when he qualified for the Crucible to play old foe Alex Higgins in what was to prove their last World Championship meeting. Higgins led 8\u20132, but was eventually relieved to win 10\u20137.<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Snooker Scene'', June 1986, p.5.</ref> It was to be Spencer's last playing visit to the Crucible. Gordon Burn relates that part of Spencer's Scottish practice was against a young [[Stephen Hendry]]. Spencer, after two money-match defeats, suggested to Hendry that they play next time in casual clothes. This occurred, with the result that Spencer won their third encounter 6\u20134.<ref>{{cite book |last=Burn |first=Gordon |title=Pocket Money |publisher=Heinemann |date=1986 |page=179}}</ref>\n\nAfter falling to a career low 34th in the rankings for the 1986/87 season, Spencer continued to work hard on his game. In the 1986 BCE International Championship, he recorded breaks of 104 and 134 against Ian Williamson;<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Snooker Scene'', October 1986, p.16.</ref> the 134 being the highest break of that year's entire event.<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Snooker Scene'' November 1986, p.21; Spencer took an additional \u00a3875 prize money; the highest break in the main competition was just 116 by Cliff Thorburn.</ref> Spencer also made a break of 129 in defeating Terry Whitthread 5\u20132 in the Dulux British Open a month later. In the final stages of this event, Spencer defeated then World Champion [[Joe Johnson (snooker player)|Joe Johnson]] 5\u20133 en route to the quarter-final. This last-eight match against old friend [[Jimmy White]] saw Spencer compile a century and capture the sixth frame after needing six snookers (in a frame which took just 18 minutes to play). Spencer lost the match 3\u20135 but gained his highest ever snooker payday with a cheque for \u00a39,000.<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Snooker Scene'', May 1987, p.11</ref> Another late career highlight came when Spencer defeated old friend [[Fred Davis (snooker player)|Fred Davis]] 5\u20130 in the 1988 British Open and followed this with a 5\u20130 televised win over Dennis Taylor on 27 February. Spencer lost just 4\u20135 in the fifth round to [[Rex Williams]], who thus recorded his first ever tournament victory over Spencer.<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Snooker Scene'', April 1988, pp.8 & 15.</ref>\n\n=== Retirement and final years ===\n\nSpencer fought hard to keep playing and keep his symptoms at bay. His final hurrah came in the 1990 World Championship qualifying, where he beat [[Ken Owers]] 10\u20138 before providing a surprisingly tough test for rising star [[James Wattana]]. Wattana won the final two frames on the final black and pink respectively to notch a 10\u20138 victory in the fourth qualifying round.<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Snooker Scene'', March 1990. p.27.</ref> Spencer's victory over Owers was his last ever victory in a recognised ranking competition.<ref name=\"cuesport\">{{cite book |last=Layton |first=Eric |title='Cuesport Book of Professional Snooker |pages=913\u201314}}</ref> In the 1991 World Championship, he lost his first match to Ray Edmonds 4\u201310, finally giving Edmonds a victory over Spencer in a rivalry that stretched back to Spencer's victory over him in the 1965 English Amateur Championships. At the time Spencer indicated a strong desire to carry on playing and stated that he was planning to enter all of the events the following season.<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Snooker Scene'' May 1991, p.7.</ref> This decision seemed especially poignant given that his old rival Ray Reardon had announced his retirement following his defeat in the 1991 World Championship Qualifying.<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Snooker Scene'', May 1991, p.5.</ref>\n\nSpencer was too ill to play in six of the ten events the following season due to a flare up of his condition in June. So many steroids were now required that they caused his hands to shake.<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Snooker Scene'', October 1991, p.13.</ref> Spencer kept his playing hopes alive by joining the management group of Six Colours Promotions in February 1992. He hoped that this might provide a much needed 'morale boost' and the stable included then World Champion [[John Parrott]], whom Spencer had advised ahead of his 1991 World Championship win.<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Snooker Scene'', March 1992, p.26.</ref> But when Spencer did play in the four remaining events he was only able to win a single frame (in the Pearl Assurance British Open against [[Euan Henderson]]).<ref name=\"cuesport\" /> His final World Championship appearance could hardly have been sadder: he scored just 207 points against Norwegian Bjorn L'Orange and lost this second round qualifying match 0\u201310.<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Snooker Scene'', May 1992, p.7.</ref>\n\nSpencer did continue to do some exhibitions and was grateful to [[Stephen Hendry]]'s manager Ian Doyle for arranging some exhibitions after he stepped down as chairman of the WPBSA. Spencer was also pleased to have the assistance at these events of [[Len Ganley]]. Soon after this, he began to have trouble with veins in his legs, making mobility an issue.<ref name=\"blue\" />{{rp|183}}\n \nHis last TV appearance as a player came in 1997 when he took part in Seniors Pot Black. Spencer later admitted that he was suffering from severe depression caused by his illness when he played this match.<ref name=\"blue\" />{{rp|72}} He generated applause with some of his shots during a frame against Dennis Taylor, which he lost 47\u201374.<ref>{{YouTube|iZPnmCVJqiA}}</ref> Despite matches only being a single frame, Spencer did not play in the Senior Masters Competition in June 2000, leaving a field of 15. This event was won by [[Willie Thorne]].<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Snooker Scene'', July 2000, pp.24\u201325.</ref>\n\nPoor health led to Spencer's departure from the role of commentator in 1998. In his memoirs, he wrote movingly of struggling through his role before retiring back to his hotel room. He was deeply moved by the kindness of fellow commentators [[Ted Lowe]] and Ray Edmonds.<ref name=\"blue\" />{{rp|172}}\n\nOn 28 January 2003 he was diagnosed with [[stomach cancer]]<ref name=\"blue\" />{{rp|184}} but he later refused treatment for it in order to enjoy the rest of his life free from the effects of [[chemotherapy]]. Spencer emotionally paid a last visit to the Crucible for the 2005 Champions Parade.<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Snooker Scene'', August 2006, p.16.</ref> He had for many years been a dedicated charity fundraiser and, despite his illness, he took part in a sponsored [[parachute jump]] in August 2005. His biography was published that same year, entitled ''Out of the Blue and into the Black''. On 11 July 2006 he died in a hospice in Bolton at the age of 70.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2006/jul/13/guardianobituaries.snooker | work=The Guardian | first=Clive | last=Everton | title=Obituary: John Spencer | date=13 July 2006}}</ref>\n\n== Playing style ==\n\nSpencer was the first major professional snooker player to use a two-piece cue, which he used to win the 1977 title. Spencer was given the cue by Al Selinger of the Dufferin Cue Company during Spencer's victorious run in the 1976 Canadian Open. He did not use the cue straight away but switched to it a few weeks before the 1977 World Championship.<ref name=\"spenceronsnooker\" />{{rp|11}}  A few months later he changed his cue again to another 2 piece, this time from Japan.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Everton, |first1=Clive |title=The story of Billiards & Snooker |date=1978 |publisher=Cassell |page=139}}</ref>\n\nHis cue action included an unusually long backswing which gave him immense cue power, and allowed him to develop shots using deep-screw from long-distance and maximum side spin which aided the progression to modern break-building.\n\n== Other snooker interests ==\n\nHe was the owner of Spencer's Snooker Club in [[Bolton]] in the 1980s, when snooker was at its peak popularity. Following his defeat by Perrie Mans in the 1978 World Championship Spencer was invited by producer Nick Hunter to try his hand at commentating on snooker for [[BBC]] television, a task he enjoyed for the next 19 years.<ref name=\"blue\" />{{rp|79}} He was also chairman of the [[World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association|WPBSA]] for six years from 1990, despite periods of extreme ill-health. When he resigned from his position in November 1996, he had been a member of the governing board for 25 years.<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Snooker Scene'', December 1996, p.3.</ref>\n\n==Performance and rankings timeline==\n<div style=\"width:auto; overflow:scroll\">\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:0 1em 0 0; border:1px #aaa solid; border-collapse:collapse; font-size:85%\"\n|- style=\"background:#efefef;\"\n!

first attempt, was the first winner at the [[Crucible Theatre]], was the inaugural winner of the Masters and Irish Masters and was the first player to make a 147 break in competition. This is regarded as an unofficial maximum break as the event used non templated tables. Spencer was born in [[Radcliffe, Greater Manchester|Radcliffe]], [[Greater Manchester]].\n\n==Career==\n\n===Early years===\nSpencer attended [[Philips High School|Stand Grammar School for Boys]] in [[Whitefield, Greater Manchester|Whitefield]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Everton|first1=Clive|title=Spencer, John (1935\u20132006)|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/articleHL/97338?docPos=4&anchor=match|website=Dictionary of National Biography|publisher=OUP}}</ref> He started his snooker career at the age of 15. Snooker was in decline during his youth, and he did not turn professional until the age of 31, when interest in the sport was starting to revive. Spencer was runner-up to [[Ray Reardon]] in the 1964 English Amateur Snooker Championship (the first tournament he ever entered) and lost to [[Pat Houlihan]] in the final of the 1965 event. Spencer finally lifted the trophy in 1966 with an 11\u20135 victory over Marcus Owen.<ref name=\"guinness\">{{cite book |last=Everton |first=Clive |title=Guinness Book of Billiards and Snooker |date=1982 |publisher=Guinness World Records Limited |isbn=0851122566}}</ref>{{rp|116}}\n\nIn February 1967, Spencer made the bold decision to turn professional. At this time there were effectively no officially organized professional tournaments and no player in the UK had turned professional since [[Rex Williams]] in 1951.<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Billiards and Snooker'', March 1969, No. 553, p.11. The article here is surprisingly small and may explain the very rare error in Everton's ''Guinness Book of Snooker'', where he states Gary Owen was the first professional since 1967 (see 1982 edition, p.76).</ref> This proved to be a very important step in re-establishing snooker as a viable sport, with amateur rivals [[Gary Owen (snooker player)|Gary Owen]] following suit in September 1967<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Billiards and Snooker'', Oct 1967, No. 560, p.5.</ref> and Ray Reardon on December 3 of that year.<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Billiards and Snooker'', Dec 1967, No. 562, p.4.</ref> This influx of new professionals led to the World Championship being revived on a challenge basis in the 1968/9 season.\n\nHe first won the [[World Snooker Championship|World Championship]] in 1969 after being loaned \u00a3100 by his bank to raise the entry fee. On 22 November 1968, Spencer defeated reigning world champion [[John Pulman]] 25\u201318 in his opening match before going on to defeat Rex Williams 37\u201312<ref>With all frames played Spencer won by the even greater margin of 55\u201318; see ''Billiards and Snooker'', No. 577, p.3.</ref> and [[Gary Owen (snooker player)|Gary Owen]] 37\u201324 in the final, held at Victoria Hall in London from 17 to 22 March.<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Billiards and Snooker'', No. 577, March 1969, p.3.</ref> 'Dead' frames were then played out to give a final frame tally of 46\u201327 to Spencer, who (with additional bonuses) took \u00a31,780 from the event.<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Billiards and Snooker'', April 1969, No. 578 p.6</ref> He thus became the only player to win the World Championship at his first attempt since [[Joe Davis]] won the inaugural championship in 1927 (the feat was emulated by [[Alex Higgins]] in 1972 and by [[Terry Griffiths]] in 1979).<ref name=\"guinness\" />{{rp|89}}\n\nIn the April 1970 World Championship, Spencer beat veteran Irish Professional Champion [[Jackie Rea]] 31\u201315, but lost his semi-final on a poor quality table to Ray Reardon 33\u201337 who went on to claim his first title.<ref name=\"guinness\" />{{rp|89}} Oddly, the de facto 1971 championship was held in November 1970 and played in [[Australia]]. Following an incomplete [[Round-robin tournament|round-robin]] Spencer thrashed Reardon 34\u201315 in the semi-final before defeating [[Warren Simpson]] in the final 37\u201329.<ref name=\"guinness\"/> During the final Spencer made three centuries in four frames (105, 126 and 107), the first time this had been achieved in the championship.<ref name=\"spenceronsnooker\">{{cite book |last=Spencer |first=John |title=Spencer on Snooker |publisher=Cassell |date=1978}}</ref>{{rp|9}}\n\nSpencer gained important TV exposure by winning [[BBC]] TV's ''[[Pot Black]]'' series in 1970 (reversing his defeat by Ray Reardon in the 1969 final) and again in 1971 when he beat [[Fred Davis (snooker player)|Fred Davis]] in the final. Spencer also claimed the highest break prize in 1972, he was runner-up in 1974, and won the event again in 1976 (beating [[Dennis Taylor]] in the final), thus becoming the first three-time winner.<ref>{{cite book |editor-last=Perrin |editor-first=Reg |title=Pot Black |publisher=BBC Books |page=22}}</ref>\n\nIn 1971 and 1972, four events sponsored by Park Drive (the [[Park Drive 2000]]) were held where each of the four players involved played nine matches, the top two placed professionals playing a final match. Spencer won three of these events and lost the fourth only 3\u20134<ref name=\"guinness\" />{{rp|90}} in the final to Ray Reardon with whom he battled for supremacy throughout the 1970s as snooker emerged from a phase of obscurity to become one of Britain\u2019s most popular sports. From 1969 to 1978, only three players defeated Spencer in the World Championship (Ray Reardon, Alex Higgins and Perrie Mans) and from 1973 to 1977 he did not lose a World Championship match by more than two frames.\n\n==== 1972 World Championship ====\n\nPivotal in the rise of snooker as one of Britain's most popular sports was the 1972 World Championship final. As defending champion in the 1972 event, Spencer beat [[Fred Davis (snooker player)|Fred Davis]] 31\u201321 and [[Eddie Charlton]] 37\u201332, before facing championship debutant [[Alex Higgins]] in the final. The week-long final was fairly balanced until the Thursday evening session which Higgins won 6\u20130, creating a gap Spencer never looked like closing. Higgins duly went on to take the match 37\u201332.<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Snooker Scene'', April 1972, p.4.</ref> The match, played at the British Legion Club in [[Selly Oak]], Birmingham, often with emergency generators providing the lighting and with hundreds of spectators crammed in, many sat on beer crates, provided the crucial spark of interest in the modern era. Higgins was already generating much interest in the sport and had been the subject of a documentary by Thames TV ahead of the final.<ref name=\"higgins\">{{cite book |last=Higgins |first=Alex |authorlink=Alex Higgins |date=2007 |title=My Story: From the Eye of the Hurricane |publisher=Headline |page=56}}</ref>\n\nSpencer made no excuses for his defeat, despite being exhausted and ill from a major tour of Canada, trapped in a lift ahead of one of the sessions, and involved in a minor car crash on the way to another session. He had also expended effort in beating Higgins 4\u20133 in the final of the [[Park Drive 2000]] event the night before their final commenced.<ref>{{cite book |last=Everton |first=Clive |title=Black Farce and Cue Ball Wizards |publisher=Mainstream |date=2007 |pages=48\u201349}}</ref> In his 2005 memoir, Spencer made clear that Higgins had played the better snooker and won the match 'fair and square'.<ref name=\"blue\">{{cite book |last=Spencer |first=John |title=Out of the Blue into the Black |publisher=Parrs Wood Press |date=2005}}</ref>{{rp|74}} Curiously, Higgins used this exact expression when discussing his victory in his memoir two years later.<ref name=\"higgins\" />{{rp|56}} Spencer was also quick to admit that Higgins' win brought in more sponsorship, more promotions, better organisation and more media interest.<ref name=\"spenceronsnooker\" />{{rp|10}}\n\nSpencer went on to win one further world title, which was the historic inaugural event at the [[Crucible Theatre]] in [[Sheffield]] in 1977. He never reached the top of the world rankings, however, always being eclipsed by his rival, Reardon. Spencer played down talk of a friendship between himself and Reardon and stated that they never socialised together.<ref name=\"blue\" />{{rp|106}} However, Spencer and Reardon paired up for the first two World Doubles events. In 1983, they lost 2\u20136 to [[Jimmy White]] and [[Tony Knowles (snooker player)|Tony Knowles]] in the quarter-finals,<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Snooker Scene'', February 1983, p.7.</ref> and in 1984 lost 0\u20135 to [[Cliff Thorburn]] and [[John Virgo]], also in the quarter-finals.<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Snooker Scene'', February 1984, p.19.</ref> The partnership only ended when Spencer thought he would be too ill to play in the 1985 event.<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Snooker Scene'', September 1984, p.5.</ref> Late in his life, Spencer joined Reardon for a special Crucible feature.<ref>{{YouTube|wFQe1T39Rfc}}</ref>\n\nIn [[1973 Norwich Union Open|1973]] and [[1974 Norwich Union Open|1974]], [[Norwich Union]] sponsored a snooker event which unusually contained both professionals and amateur players. Spencer won the event both times it was held beating Alex Higgins 8\u20132 (in the semi-final) and John Pulman 8\u20137 (in the final) to win the 1973 event and beating Cliff Thorburn 9\u20137 (in the semi-finals) and Ray Reardon 10\u20139 (in the final) to win the 1974 event. This latter victory was even more notable given that his cue had been broken into four pieces ten days before the 1974 event and he had to have it pieced back together.<ref>Spencer, John, ''Spencer on Snooker'', Cassell, Second Edition, 1978, p.10, although Spencer listed the date as 1973 in his 2005 book, ''Out of the Blue into the Black'', see p.75, but photos of the broken cue appear in the February 1975 edition of ''Snooker Scene'' (p. 13).</ref> Spencer was runner-up in both inaugural Pontins events, first held in 1974. He lost the Open (conceding 25) to Doug Mountjoy 4\u20137 and the Professional event 9\u201310 to Ray Reardon (after Spencer had trailed 4\u20139).<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Snooker Scene'', July 1974, p.9.</ref> He also won a minor tournament at the end of 1974, the Jackpot Automatics tournament, beating Alex Higgins 5\u20130 in the final.<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Snooker Scene'', December 1974, p.20.</ref>\n\nA sign of growing interest in snooker's resurgence came when [[Ladbrokes]] held a gala evening towards the end of 1973 to celebrate its \u00a38,000 investment into the sport in the 1973\u201374 season. The gala evening event (held at the Cafe Royal) saw Spencer take first prize with a 3\u20132 win over [[Ray Edmonds]].<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Snooker Scene'', December 1973, p.9.</ref>\n\nSpencer's good form was not to be translated into positive results at the 1973 and 1974 World Championships. Arguably his most disappointing career loss was his 22\u201323 defeat by Ray Reardon in the 1973 World Championship semi-final, after leading 16\u20139 and 19\u201312. Prior to this, Spencer had shown decisive form in defeating [[David Taylor (snooker player)|David Taylor]] 16\u20135 and Rex Williams 16\u20137. In the final, Reardon defeated Eddie Charlton, a player to whom Spencer would not lose in a major match until 1979.<ref name=\"guinness\" />{{rp|91}}\n\nIn 1974, he lost 13\u201315 to [[Perrie Mans]] in the second round. Spencer refused to blame the defeat on a dose of flu from which he had been suffering (and Mans did indeed defeat Spencer again in the 1978 event). Spencer's only consolation was a plate competition for first and second round losers where he easily crushed his opponents, notching up six centuries in defeating David Greaves 5\u20131, [[Dennis Taylor]] 9\u20134, [[Jim Meadowcroft]] 9\u20133 and John Pulman 15\u20135 in the final.<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Snooker Scene'', June 1974, pp. 9 & 18.</ref>\n\nIn 1975, Spencer won the inaugural Masters event held at [[Fulham]]'s West Centre Hotel. He defeated John Pulman (5\u20133), [[Eddie Charlton]] (5\u20132) and overcame Ray Reardon in the closest of finals.<ref name=\"guinness\" />{{rp|92}} Spencer trailed 6\u20138, but leveled at 8\u20138 and took the final frame on a re-spotted Black.<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Snooker Scene'', February 1975, p.7.</ref> In the spring, he won the invitational Ashton Court Country Club event (and took the highest break prize) by defeating Alex Higgins 5\u20131 in front of a sell out crowd in the final.<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Snooker Scene'', May 1975, p.5.</ref> Spencer lost 2\u20135 to Higgins in the final of the Castle Open pro-am at the end of the year.<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Snooker Scene'', February 1976, p.9.</ref>\n\nSpencer again faced disappointment at the 1975 World Championship, in a somewhat controversial manner. With the tournament being staged in [[Australia]] and organised by Eddie Charlton, Spencer found himself in a half of the draw which featured both Ray Reardon and Alex Higgins, meaning that all the champions since 1969 were in the same half of the draw. Still worse, the organisational seedings placed Spencer at 8, meaning that he met Reardon in the quarter-final. Despite opening up with two centuries in the first four frames and leading 17\u201316, with the scars of their epic 1973 semi-final still fresh, the match slipped away from Spencer 17\u201319. At the time, both Reardon and Spencer stated boldly that it was the greatest match yet played.<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Snooker Scene'', June 1975, p.5.</ref>\n\nThe following year, the 1976 World Championship saw an even narrower defeat for Spencer at the same stage. Having defeated David Taylor 15\u20135, and claiming the highest break prize in the process,<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Snooker Scene'', May 1976, p.15. The break was 138 and the prize \u00a3200.</ref> he lost to Alex Higgins in the quarter-final 14\u201315, having trailed 12\u201314. The quality of the match was a pale shadow of their 1972 encounter.<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Snooker Scene''. June 1976, p.15.</ref>\n\nA minor consolation came when Spencer won the [[1976 Canadian Open]] that year, defeating [[John Virgo]] 9\u20134 in the semi-final and Alex Higgins 17\u20139 in the final to claim the $5,000 prize.<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Snooker Scene'', November 1976, pp. 14\u201316.</ref>\n\n=== Final World Championship victory and other titles ===\n\nSpencer returned to win his third world title in 1977, the first world championship to be held at the Crucible Theatre where it has remained ever since. Seeded 8, Spencer defeated John Virgo 13\u20139 (having trailed 1\u20134), Ray Reardon 13\u20136, a resurgent John Pulman 18\u201316, and finally Cliff Thorburn 25\u201321 (having trailed 11\u201315) in the final. Spencer won \u00a36,000 for his victory. He followed this up by winning the [[1977 Pontins Professional|Pontins Professional]] title a week later, defeating John Pulman 7\u20135 in the final to win another \u00a31,500.<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Snooker Scene'', June 1977, pp. 14\u201324.</ref> Spencer's World Championship victory in 1977 was the last time that he seriously challenged for the world title; he never again reached even the quarter-finals of any future World Championship.\n\nSpencer reached the final of the [[1977 Canadian Open|Canadian Open]] again in 1977, where he lost to Higgins 14\u201317.<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Snooker Scene'', October 1977, p.15.</ref> This event was played in a circus tent, with a traditional circus situated next to the event. Conditions were so hot that Spencer's chalk snapped in half upon using it due to accumulated dampness in his pocket.<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Snooker Scene'', October 1977, p.14.</ref>\n\nIn the spring of 1978 Spencer won the very first [[1978 Irish Masters|Irish Masters]] by beating [[Doug Mountjoy]] 5\u20133 in the final at Goffs Sales Room. Spencer took \u00a31,000, but the event was so successful it brought in around \u00a33,300 in [[gate receipts]].<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Snooker Scene'', May 1978, p.17.</ref> Prior to this, Spencer had won a precursor to this event in Ireland, held at the National Boxing Stadium. In 1975, he beat Alex Higgins in a one off match and then beat Higgins again in the final of a four-man event held in 1976.<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Snooker Scene'', April 1976, p.15. Spencer stated that the [[Waterford Crystal]] trophy he received was the only one he still possessed as of 2005. Spencer, John, ''Out of the Blue into the Black'', Parrs Wood Press, p.76.</ref> Spencer's good form continued when he beat [[Tony Knowles (snooker player)|Tony Knowles]] 7\u20134 in the final of the 1978 Warners Open. Despite conceding 21 points per frame, Spencer did not even drop a frame until the final.<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Snooker Scene'', July 1978, p.9.</ref> Spencer was undefeated in the group stages of the Pontins Professional tournament that year, winning all five of his matches, but he lost 2\u20137 to Ray Reardon in the final.<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Snooker Scene'', June 1978, p.20.</ref>\n\nSpencer warmed up for the 1978 World Championship by winning the Castle Professional event, defeating Alex higgins 5\u20133 in the final.<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Snooker Scene'', May 1978, p.22.</ref> However, he lost his opening match in the World Championship to Perrie Mans by 8\u201313, a result which had looked unlikely when a break of 118 had given him a 3\u20131 lead. Spencer began the final session with a 138 break, which would prove to be the highest of the championship, but did not win another frame. The break at least doubled his prize money to \u00a31,000.<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Snooker Scene'', June 1978, p.11.</ref>\n\n===First unofficial 147 break in a tournament===\nIn January 1979 at the [[1979 Holsten Lager International|Holsten Lager International]], Spencer compiled the first ever 147 maximum break in tournament play. He was playing Cliff Thorburn in the quarter-final and won the first three frames of their encounter 106\u20131, 147\u20130 and 119\u20130. Spencer could not resist giving the excited spectators a shock by lunging forward and hitting over the cue ball in his initial address, before potting the final black. [[Thames Television]] were resting their TV crew at the time following the previous match between Alex Higgins and [[David Taylor (snooker player)|David Taylor]] and so missed the historic moment. This did not count as an official maximum break as the event used non templated tables, so it remains an unofficial maximum break. Spencer went on to win the tournament, beating Rex Williams 6\u20132 in the semi-final and [[Graham Miles]] 11\u20137 in the final. The sponsors awarded Spencer an extra \u00a3500 for the break in addition to his \u00a33,500 first prize.<ref>Everton, Clive, ''Snooker Scene''. February 1979, pp.12\u201315. The figure is given as \u00a350 in ''Out of the Blue in the Black'', see p.79.</ref> Three years later on 11 January 1982, Spencer was [[Steve Davis]]'s opponent when Davis made the first televised [[Maximum break|147]] at the [[Classic (snooker)|Lada Classic]] tournament at the Queen Elizabeth Hall, [[Oldham]]. This occurred in the fifth frame of their quarter-final match when the scores had been poised at two frames each.<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Snooker Scene'', February 1982, p.5.</ref>\n\nTwo months after Spencer's 147 he won the biggest tournament that India had yet staged when he won the Garware Paints Invitational event in [[Bombay]]. Spencer beat India's Arvind Savur 6\u20131, [[Patsy Fagan]] 6\u20134, Graham Miles 6\u20135 and Cliff Thorburn 6\u20133 to take the \u00a32,000 first prize and another \u00a3200 for the highest break (108) and also claimed the 'Man of the Series' award.<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Snooker Scene'', April 1979, p.16.</ref> In the same event the following year, Spencer remained undefeated in his group matches, before his semi-final loss to John Virgo. These matches included a 6\u20134 victory over Steve Davis (who won the UK title later that year).<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Snooker Scene'', February 1981, p.7.</ref> Although Spencer would run Davis close in future years, this was his only victory over Davis in a recognised event.\n\nSpencer reached the semi-final of the [[1979 Irish Masters|Irish Masters]] in 1979, losing just 2\u20133 to Ray Reardon, having made the highest break of the tournament (121) at the group stage. Spencer was also runner-up to Reardon in the 1979 Forward Chemicals event, the final of this extended event (which duplicated the old Park Drive 2000 format) was played in front of 680 people at the Royal Exchange Theatre in Manchester. Spencer lost 6\u20139, and took \u00a32,300.<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Snooker Scene'', March 1979, p.13.</ref> Later that year, Spencer lost 1\u20134 to Steve Davis in the semi-final of the Pontins Open event.<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Snooker Scene'', June 1979, p.23.</ref>\n\nIn January 1980, Spencer won \u00a33,000 (a record for a two-day event) at the Wilson's Classic.<ref name=\"guinness\" />{{rp|100}} Broadcast by [[Granada TV]], the final contained another notorious push-shot incident adjudged against Spencer's opponent Alex Higgins.<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Snooker Scene'', February 1980 pp.16\u201317. See also https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZW6VxHK-hY</ref> Higgins received a \u00a3200 fine for his reaction to Jim Thorpe's controversial decision.<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Snooker Scene'', March 1980, p.21.</ref> Spencer also won the Winfield Australian Masters in 1980, beating Dennis Taylor in the final.<ref name=\"blue\" />{{rp|80\u201381}} This was Spencer's last professional solo tournament victory (he was runner-up in the 1981 event).\n\nIn February 1981 in the John Courage English Professional Championship, after a 9\u20131 first round victory over Pat Houlihan, Spencer led Steve Davis 7\u20136 in the quarter-final, having notched in a break of 112. However, Spencer lost three tight frames to lose the match 7\u20139. Davis lost just five frames in his other 3 matches combined.<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Snooker Scene'', April 1981, pp.22\u201328.</ref>\n\nLater in that same year, Spencer joined [[Steve Davis]] and David Taylor to become the first English team to win the World Team Classic. Spencer crucially defeated [[Terry Griffiths]] with the aid of a hard-fought 103 break (he was unable to pot the black during the entire break) in the final, Griffiths having not lost a match in the tournament up to that stage. Davis then secured victory against Ray Reardon in the tie-break to secure the title and \u00a312,000.<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Snooker Scene'', December 1981, p.11.</ref>\n\nSuch a victory only partially made up for Spencer's great disappointment at the 1981 Masters event. Having dispatched Dennis Taylor 5\u20132 and Ray Reardon 5\u20131, Spencer led Terry Griffiths 5\u20132 with Griffiths needing two snookers in the next frame. However, Griffiths managed to recover the match and eventually won by 6\u20135 after almost six hours of play. Spencer thus missed out on a major final with old rival Alex Higgins.<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Snooker Scene'', March 1981, p.11.</ref>\n\nRemarkably, Spencer's 10\u20139 first round victory over [[Ray Edmonds]] at the 1981 World Championship was his first victory in the Championship since his title victory in 1977. Hopes that Spencer might progress further were dashed by an even older adversary, Ray Reardon, who recovered from 0\u20133 and 5\u20137 behind to win the match 13\u201311.<ref>Everton, Clive (Ed.) ''Snooker Scene'', June 1981, pp. 7 & 10/11.</ref> It was to be the last time the two would meet in the World Championship.\n\nPrior to the 1982 World Championship, Spencer beat Alex Higgins (who won the world title a few weeks later) 6\u20130 in the semi-final of the [[1982 Highland Masters]] in [[Inverness]]. Spencer lost 4\u201311 to Ray Reardon in the final, after taking the highest break prize with an effort of 119. The 1982 World Championship itself produced a great many upsets and the loss of the top three seeds in round one. Despite a strong performance in beating [[John Dunning (snooker player)|John Dunning]] 10\u20134 in round one, Spencer could not take advantage of the more open draw and his form fell away badly after holding [[Willie Thorne]] to 3\u20133 in round two. He lost the match 5\u201313.<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Snooker Scene'', June 1982, pp.33, 15 & 20/21.</ref>\n\nAt the end of 1982 Spencer finally won a match in the UK Championship, having lost his first match in every event since the inaugural tournament in 1977. This looked unlikely when his opponent, veteran Scot Eddie Sinclair opened up the deciding frame with a 54 break, but Spencer grabbed a lifeline and saw out the match with a 50 break to win 9\u20138. Spencer then followed this up by eliminating one of the favourites, Tony Knowles 9\u20136, before losing to Alex Higgins 5\u20139 in the quarter-finals.<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Snooker Scene'', January 1983, pp.8\u201315.</ref>\n\n1983 also began very promisingly when Spencer defeated Ray Reardon 5\u20133 and David Taylor 5\u20132 in the Lada Classic. This guaranteed a cheque for \u00a36,000 (the same as he won for winning the 1977 World Championship). In the semi-final, Spencer led Steve Davis 3\u20131, then 4\u20132, and 45\u201329 in the deciding frame, before Davis finally squeezed home, denying Spencer what would have been his highest ever payday.<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Snooker Scene'', February 1983, pp.11\u201316. A finalist was guaranteed \u00a310,000.</ref>\n\nThe 1983 World Championship also ended in disappointment. After seeing off the challenge of 24-year-old [[Mike Hallett]] in round one by 10\u20137, Spencer faced old foe Eddie Charlton in round two. Spencer moved into a 4\u20130 lead, but lost his intensity and despite a break of 106 allowed Charlton to move 12\u20137 ahead. Spencer fought back, but went in-off on the verge of levelling at 12\u201312 and lost the match 11\u201313.<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Snooker Scene'', June 1983, pp.7 & 15.</ref>\n\nImmediately after this Spencer lost narrowly again when he was defeated by [[Tony Meo]], 5\u20134, in the semi-final of the Pontin's event at Brean Sands. An even narrower loss came when Spencer and partner John Virgo lost the doubles event on the final black to Meo and Jimmy White.<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Snooker Scene'', July 1983 pp.10\u201311.</ref>\n\n=== Illness ===\n\nSpencer's later career was blighted by the ocular version of [[myasthenia gravis]] (with symptoms including [[Diplopia|double vision]]). He first noticed something was amiss when he felt unwell at the Pontin's professional tournament in 1984.<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Snooker Scene'', July 1984, p.3. Spencer gives the date as 9 May 1985 and calls the day 'the worst of his life' in his autobiography (p.9); however, ''Snooker Scene'' reported his condition in their July 1984 issue and issued an update on his condition in the September 1984 edition (p.5).</ref> When the news broke in the press of Spencer's condition, he noted that only two players directly sent messages to him. One was Cliff Thorburn, the other was Alex Higgins, who turned up at his house, complete with bottle of Bacardi which Higgins drank as Spencer was not allowed alcohol at this point.<ref name=\"blue\" />{{rp|158}}\n\nWhile the illness affected Spencer late in his career, it robbed him of the modest upturn that had seen him rise to 13th in the 1984/85 rankings.<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Snooker Scene'', July 1984, p.13.</ref> He had also only narrowly failed to capture the Pontin's Professional title that summer when he lost 7\u20139 to Willie Thorne in the final.<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Snooker Scene'', July 1984, p.6.</ref> During the 1984 World Championship he had defeated Graham Miles 10\u20133 in the first round and held top seed Steve Davis to 4\u20136 in round two, before Davis pulled away to win 13\u20135. The Miles match was Spencer's last victory at the Crucible.<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Snooker Scene'', June 1984, pp.5 & 12.</ref>\n\nAlthough Spencer was able to compete in the 1984/85 season, it was clear that the illness was affecting his form. He won only one ranking match during the season when he defeated Canadian Frank Jonik 6\u20130 in the Dulux British Open.<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Snooker Scene'', February 1985, p.23.</ref> There was some cheer when Spencer partnered [[Tony Knowles (snooker player)|Tony Knowles]] to the semi-finals of the World Doubles in December 1984 which gave them a cheque for \u00a311,250.<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Snooker Scene'', February 1985, p.10.</ref> Spencer also marked his final appearance in the Masters with a 5\u20133 win over Eddie Charlton. Although he lost 2\u20135 to [[Jimmy White]] in the quarter-finals, he picked up one of his highest pay cheques of \u00a38,250. Spencer was also part of the England 'B' team in the World Cup (with Jimmy White and Willie Thorne) which reached the semi-finals.<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Snooker Scene'', May 1985, p.9. The semi-finalists received \u00a312,500.</ref> Such outings allowed Spencer to finish within the top 15 money earners for the season.<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Snooker Scene'', July 1985, pp.6\u20137.</ref> Another small consolation came when he narrowly lost in the 1984 final of [[Pot Black]] to [[Terry Griffiths]].<ref name=\"blue\" />{{rp|71}}\n\nA major side effect of Spencer's condition was a susceptibility to eye strain under the bright TV lighting. When he competed in the [[1985 Pontins Professional]] event under ordinary shaded lighting he once again reached the final, losing only 7\u20139 to Terry Griffiths, who Spencer would never defeat in a major singles event.<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Snooker Scene'', July 1985, p.9</ref> It also proved to be his last ever tournament final.\n\nSpencer journeyed to [[Scotland]] ahead of the 1986 World Championship to get in concentrated practice. This paid off when he qualified for the Crucible to play old foe Alex Higgins in what was to prove their last World Championship meeting. Higgins led 8\u20132, but was eventually relieved to win 10\u20137.<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Snooker Scene'', June 1986, p.5.</ref> It was to be Spencer's last playing visit to the Crucible. Gordon Burn relates that part of Spencer's Scottish practice was against a young [[Stephen Hendry]]. Spencer, after two money-match defeats, suggested to Hendry that they play next time in casual clothes. This occurred, with the result that Spencer won their third encounter 6\u20134.<ref>{{cite book |last=Burn |first=Gordon |title=Pocket Money |publisher=Heinemann |date=1986 |page=179}}</ref>\n\nAfter falling to a career low 34th in the rankings for the 1986/87 season, Spencer continued to work hard on his game. In the 1986 BCE International Championship, he recorded breaks of 104 and 134 against Ian Williamson;<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Snooker Scene'', October 1986, p.16.</ref> the 134 being the highest break of that year's entire event.<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Snooker Scene'' November 1986, p.21; Spencer took an additional \u00a3875 prize money; the highest break in the main competition was just 116 by Cliff Thorburn.</ref> Spencer also made a break of 129 in defeating Terry Whitthread 5\u20132 in the Dulux British Open a month later. In the final stages of this event, Spencer defeated then World Champion [[Joe Johnson (snooker player)|Joe Johnson]] 5\u20133 en route to the quarter-final. This last-eight match against old friend [[Jimmy White]] saw Spencer compile a century and capture the sixth frame after needing six snookers (in a frame which took just 18 minutes to play). Spencer lost the match 3\u20135 but gained his highest ever snooker payday with a cheque for \u00a39,000.<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Snooker Scene'', May 1987, p.11</ref> Another late career highlight came when Spencer defeated old friend [[Fred Davis (snooker player)|Fred Davis]] 5\u20130 in the 1988 British Open and followed this with a 5\u20130 televised win over Dennis Taylor on 27 February. Spencer lost just 4\u20135 in the fifth round to [[Rex Williams]], who thus recorded his first ever tournament victory over Spencer.<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Snooker Scene'', April 1988, pp.8 & 15.</ref>\n\n=== Retirement and final years ===\n\nSpencer fought hard to keep playing and keep his symptoms at bay. His final hurrah came in the 1990 World Championship qualifying, where he beat [[Ken Owers]] 10\u20138 before providing a surprisingly tough test for rising star [[James Wattana]]. Wattana won the final two frames on the final black and pink respectively to notch a 10\u20138 victory in the fourth qualifying round.<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Snooker Scene'', March 1990. p.27.</ref> Spencer's victory over Owers was his last ever victory in a recognised ranking competition.<ref name=\"cuesport\">{{cite book |last=Layton |first=Eric |title='Cuesport Book of Professional Snooker |pages=913\u201314}}</ref> In the 1991 World Championship, he lost his first match to Ray Edmonds 4\u201310, finally giving Edmonds a victory over Spencer in a rivalry that stretched back to Spencer's victory over him in the 1965 English Amateur Championships. At the time Spencer indicated a strong desire to carry on playing and stated that he was planning to enter all of the events the following season.<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Snooker Scene'' May 1991, p.7.</ref> This decision seemed especially poignant given that his old rival Ray Reardon had announced his retirement following his defeat in the 1991 World Championship Qualifying.<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Snooker Scene'', May 1991, p.5.</ref>\n\nSpencer was too ill to play in six of the ten events the following season due to a flare up of his condition in June. So many steroids were now required that they caused his hands to shake.<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Snooker Scene'', October 1991, p.13.</ref> Spencer kept his playing hopes alive by joining the management group of Six Colours Promotions in February 1992. He hoped that this might provide a much needed 'morale boost' and the stable included then World Champion [[John Parrott]], whom Spencer had advised ahead of his 1991 World Championship win.<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Snooker Scene'', March 1992, p.26.</ref> But when Spencer did play in the four remaining events he was only able to win a single frame (in the Pearl Assurance British Open against [[Euan Henderson]]).<ref name=\"cuesport\" /> His final World Championship appearance could hardly have been sadder: he scored just 207 points against Norwegian Bjorn L'Orange and lost this second round qualifying match 0\u201310.<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Snooker Scene'', May 1992, p.7.</ref>\n\nSpencer did continue to do some exhibitions and was grateful to [[Stephen Hendry]]'s manager Ian Doyle for arranging some exhibitions after he stepped down as chairman of the WPBSA. Spencer was also pleased to have the assistance at these events of [[Len Ganley]]. Soon after this, he began to have trouble with veins in his legs, making mobility an issue.<ref name=\"blue\" />{{rp|183}}\n \nHis last TV appearance as a player came in 1997 when he took part in Seniors Pot Black. Spencer later admitted that he was suffering from severe depression caused by his illness when he played this match.<ref name=\"blue\" />{{rp|72}} He generated applause with some of his shots during a frame against Dennis Taylor, which he lost 47\u201374.<ref>{{YouTube|iZPnmCVJqiA}}</ref> Despite matches only being a single frame, Spencer did not play in the Senior Masters Competition in June 2000, leaving a field of 15. This event was won by [[Willie Thorne]].<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Snooker Scene'', July 2000, pp.24\u201325.</ref>\n\nPoor health led to Spencer's departure from the role of commentator in 1998. In his memoirs, he wrote movingly of struggling through his role before retiring back to his hotel room. He was deeply moved by the kindness of fellow commentators [[Ted Lowe]] and Ray Edmonds.<ref name=\"blue\" />{{rp|172}}\n\nOn 28 January 2003 he was diagnosed with [[stomach cancer]]<ref name=\"blue\" />{{rp|184}} but he later refused treatment for it in order to enjoy the rest of his life free from the effects of [[chemotherapy]]. Spencer emotionally paid a last visit to the Crucible for the 2005 Champions Parade.<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Snooker Scene'', August 2006, p.16.</ref> He had for many years been a dedicated charity fundraiser and, despite his illness, he took part in a sponsored [[parachute jump]] in August 2005. His biography was published that same year, entitled ''Out of the Blue and into the Black''. On 11 July 2006 he died in a hospice in Bolton at the age of 70.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2006/jul/13/guardianobituaries.snooker | work=The Guardian | first=Clive | last=Everton | title=Obituary: John Spencer | date=13 July 2006}}</ref>\n\n== Playing style ==\n\nSpencer was the first major professional snooker player to use a two-piece cue, which he used to win the 1977 title. Spencer was given the cue by Al Selinger of the Dufferin Cue Company during Spencer's victorious run in the 1976 Canadian Open. He did not use the cue straight away but switched to it a few weeks before the 1977 World Championship.<ref name=\"spenceronsnooker\" />{{rp|11}}  A few months later he changed his cue again to another 2 piece, this time from Japan.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Everton, |first1=Clive |title=The story of Billiards & Snooker |date=1978 |publisher=Cassell |page=139}}</ref>\n\nHis cue action included an unusually long backswing which gave him immense cue power, and allowed him to develop shots using deep-screw from long-distance and maximum side spin which aided the progression to modern break-building.\n\n== Other snooker interests ==\n\nHe was the owner of Spencer's Snooker Club in [[Bolton]] in the 1980s, when snooker was at its peak popularity. Following his defeat by Perrie Mans in the 1978 World Championship Spencer was invited by producer Nick Hunter to try his hand at commentating on snooker for [[BBC]] television, a task he enjoyed for the next 19 years.<ref name=\"blue\" />{{rp|79}} He was also chairman of the [[World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association|WPBSA]] for six years from 1990, despite periods of extreme ill-health. When he resigned from his position in November 1996, he had been a member of the governing board for 25 years.<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.), ''Snooker Scene'', December 1996, p.3.</ref>\n\n==Performance and rankings timeline==\n<div style=\"width:auto; overflow:scroll\">\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:0 1em 0 0; border:1px #aaa solid; border-collapse:collapse; font-size:85%\"\n|- style=\"background:#efefef;\"\n!

similar to the [[Commonwealth Railways GM class|GM12]] class then being built by [[Clyde Engineering]] for the [[Commonwealth Railways]]. They were mechanically similar to the 1952 built double ended [[Victorian Railways B class (diesel)|B class]].\n\nThe first order for 10 locomotives, were progressively delivered between August 1957 and February 1958. The first four took the names and numbers of the recently scrapped [[Victorian Railways S class|S class steam locomotives]], with all being named after prominent Victorians. An additional eight locomotives were ordered for use on the new [[North East standard gauge line, Victoria|North East standard gauge line]] and delivered between November 1960 and December 1961.<ref name=AustModelRailMagazineMar79>{{cite journal|date=March\u2013April 1979 |title=VR 'S' class diesel electric locomotive|author=Ian Weickhardt|journal=Australian Model Railway Magazine|pages=34\u201336}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Oberg|first=Leon|title=Locomotives of Australia 1850s - 1980s|year=1984|publisher=Reed Books|location=Frenchs Forest|isbn=0 730100 05 7|pages=196\u2013197}}</ref>\n\nThe class were initially used on express passenger trains such as the ''[[Intercapital Daylight]]'', ''[[Southern Aurora]]'', ''[[Spirit of Progress]]'' and ''[[The Overland]]'', but were also used on fast freights.

Transfer from field care to definitive care, where oxygen use can be carefully calibrated, typically occurs long before significant reductions to the respiratory drive.\n\nA 2010 study has shown that titrated oxygen therapy (controlled administration of oxygen) is less of a danger to people with COPD and that other, non-COPD people, may also, in some cases, benefit more from titrated therapy.<ref name=\"tasmanian\" />\n\n===Fire risk===\nHighly concentrated sources of oxygen promote rapid combustion.

The heat caused by rapid pressurization serves as the ignition source. For this reason, storage vessels, regulators, piping and any other equipment used with highly concentrated oxygen must be \"oxygen-clean\" prior to use, to ensure the absence of potential fuels. This does not apply only to pure oxygen; any concentration significantly higher than atmospheric (approximately 21%) carries a potential risk.\n\nHospitals in some jurisdictions, such as the UK, now operate \"no-smoking\" policies, which although introduced for other reasons, support the aim of keeping ignition sources away from medical piped oxygen. Recorded sources of ignition of medically prescribed oxygen include candles, aromatherapy, medical equipment, cooking, and unfortunately, deliberate vandalism. Smoking of pipes, cigars, and cigarettes is of special concern. These policies do not entirely eliminate the risk of injury with portable oxygen systems, especially if [[Compliance (medicine)|compliance]] is poor.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.medbc.com/annals/review/vol_19/num_2/text/vol19n2p99.asp|title=Home Oxygen Therapy and Cigarette Smoking: A Dangerous Practice|vauthors=Lindford AJ, Tehrani H, Sassoon EM, O'Neill TJ|journal=Annals of Burns and Fire Disasters|volume=19|issue=2|date=June 2006|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121220428/http://www.medbc.com/annals/review/vol_19/num_2/text/vol19n2p99.asp|archivedate=2008-11-21}}</ref>\n\n===Alternative medicine===\n\nSome practitioners of [[alternative medicine]] have promoted \"oxygen therapy\" as a cure for many human ailments including [[AIDS]], [[Alzheimer's disease]] and [[cancer]].

This is widely used at hospitals due to their high usage requirements, but can also be used in other settings. See [[Vacuum Insulated Evaporator]] for more information on this method of storage.\n#Compressed gas storage \u2013 The oxygen gas is compressed in a [[gas cylinder]], which provides a convenient storage, without the requirement for refrigeration found with liquid storage. Large oxygen cylinders hold {{convert|6500|l|cuft}} and can last about two days at a flow rate of 2 litres per minute.

In most cases, the oxygen will first pass through a [[pressure regulator]], used to control the high pressure of oxygen delivered from a cylinder (or other source) to a lower pressure. This lower pressure is then controlled by a [[flowmeter]], which may be preset or selectable, and this controls the flow in a measure such as litres per minute (lpm). The typical flowmeter range for medical oxygen is between 0 and 15 lpm with some units able to obtain up to 25 liters per minute. Many wall flowmeters using a [[Thorpe tube flowmeter|Thorpe tube]] design are able to be dialed to \"flush\" which is beneficial in emergency situations.\n\n===Low-dose oxygen===\nMany people only require a slight increase in oxygen in the air they breathe, rather than pure or near-pure oxygen.<ref>{{harvnb|Kallstrom|2002}}</ref> This can be delivered through a number of devices dependent on the situation, the flow required and in some instances person's preference.\n\nA [[nasal cannula]] (NC) is a thin tube with two small nozzles that protrude into the person's nostrils. It can only comfortably provide oxygen at low flow rates, 2\u20136 litres per minute (LPM), delivering a concentration of 24\u201340%.\n\nThere are also a number of face mask options, such as the [[simple face mask]], often used at between 5 and 8 LPM, with a concentration of oxygen to the person of between 28% and 50%. This is closely related to the more controlled [[air-entrainment masks]], also known as Venturi masks, which can accurately deliver a predetermined oxygen concentration to the trachea up to 40%.\n\nIn some instances, a partial rebreathing mask can be used, which is based on a simple mask, but featuring a reservoir bag, which increases the provided oxygen concentration to 40\u201370% oxygen at 5\u201315 LPM.\n\nNon-rebreather masks draw oxygen from attached reservoir bags, with one-way valves that direct exhaled air out of the mask. When properly fitted and used at flow rates of 8\u201310 LPM or higher, they deliver close to 100% oxygen. This type of mask is indicated for acute medical emergencies.\n\nDemand oxygen delivery systems (DODS) or oxygen resuscitators deliver oxygen only when the person inhales, or, in the case of a non-breathing person, the caregiver presses a button on the mask. These systems greatly conserve oxygen compared to steady-flow masks, which is useful in emergency situations when a limited supply of oxygen is available and there is a delay in transporting the person to higher care. They are very useful in performing [[CPR]], as the caregiver can deliver rescue breaths composed of 100% oxygen with the press of a button. Care must be taken not to over-inflate the person's lungs, and some systems employ safety valves to help prevent this. These systems may not be appropriate for people who are unconscious or those in respiratory distress, because of the effort required to breathe from them.\n\n===High flow oxygen delivery===\n\nIn cases where the person requires a high concentration of up to 100% oxygen, a number of devices are available, with the most common being the [[non-rebreather mask]] (or reservoir mask), which is similar to the partial rebreathing mask except it has a series of one-way valves preventing exhaled air from returning to the bag. There should be a minimum flow of 10 L/min.

Systems for delivering this vary in complexity (and cost), starting with a basic [[pocket mask]] adjunct which can be used by a basically trained first aider to manually deliver [[artificial respiration]] with supplemental oxygen delivered through a port in the mask.\n\nMany [[emergency medical service]] and [[first aid]] personnel, as well as hospitals, will use a [[bag-valve-mask]] (BVM), which is a malleable bag attached to a face mask (or invasive airway such as an [[endotracheal tube]] or [[laryngeal mask airway]]), usually with a reservoir bag attached, which is manually manipulated by the healthcare professional to push oxygen (or air) into the lungs. This is the only procedure allowed for initial treatment of [[cyanide poisoning]] in the [[UK]] workplace.<ref>[http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/misc076.htm Cyanide poisoning \u2013 New recommendations on first aid treatment] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091020204249/http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/misc076.htm |date=2009-10-20 }}</ref>\n\nAutomated versions of the BVM system, known as a [[resuscitator]] or pneupac can also deliver measured and timed doses of oxygen direct to people through a facemask or airway. These systems are related to the [[anaesthetic machine]]s used in operations under [[general anaesthesia]] that allows a variable amount of oxygen to be delivered, along with other gases including air, [[nitrous oxide]] and [[inhalational anaesthetic]]s.\n\n===As a drug delivery route===\nOxygen and other compressed gasses are used in conjunction with a [[nebulizer]] to allow the delivery of medications to the upper and/or lower airways. Nebulizers use compressed gas to propel liquid medication into an aerosol, with specific therapeutically sized droplets, for deposition in the appropriate, desired portion of the airway. A typical compressed gas flow rate of 8\u201310 L/min is used to [[nebulize]] medications, saline, sterile water, or a mixture of the preceding into a therapeutic aerosol for inhalation. In the clinical setting room air (ambient mix of several gasses), [[molecular oxygen]], and [[Heliox]]{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} are the most common gases used to nebulize a [[Bolus (medicine)|bolus]] or a continuous volume of therapeutic aerosols.\n\n===Exhalation filters for oxygen masks===\nFiltered oxygen masks have the ability to prevent exhaled, potentially infectious particles from being released into the surrounding environment. These masks are normally of a closed design such that leaks are minimized and breathing of room air is controlled through a series of one-way valves. Filtration of exhaled breaths is accomplished either by placing a filter on the exhalation port or through an integral filter that is part of the mask itself. These masks first became popular in the Toronto (Canada) healthcare community during the 2003 SARS Crisis. SARS was identified as being respiratory based and it was determined that conventional oxygen therapy devices were not designed for the containment of exhaled particles.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Hui DS, Hall SD, Chan MT, etal |title=Exhaled air dispersion during oxygen delivery via a simple oxygen mask |journal=Chest |volume=132 |issue=2 |pages=540\u201346 |date=August 2007 |pmid=17573505 |doi=10.1378/chest.07-0636 |url=http://www.chestjournal.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=17573505 |pmc=7094533 }}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal  |vauthors=Mardimae A, Slessarev M, Han J, etal |title=Modified N95 mask delivers high inspired oxygen concentrations while effectively filtering aerosolized microparticles |journal=Annals of Emergency Medicine |volume=48 |issue=4 |pages=391\u201399, 399.e1\u20132 |date=October 2006 |pmid=16997675 |doi=10.1016/j.annemergmed.2006.06.039 |url=|pmc=7118976 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Somogyi R, Vesely AE, Azami T, etal |title=Dispersal of respiratory droplets with open vs closed oxygen delivery masks: implications for the transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome |journal=Chest |volume=125 |issue=3 |pages=1155\u201357 |date=March 2004 |pmid=15006983 |url=http://www.chestjournal.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=15006983 |doi=10.1378/chest.125.3.1155 |pmc=7094599 }}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>  Common practices of having suspected people {{clarify|date=April 2016}} wear a surgical mask was confounded by the use of standard oxygen therapy equipment. In 2003, the HiOx<sup>80</sup> oxygen mask was released for sale. The HiOx<sup>80</sup> mask is a closed design mask that allows a filter to be placed on the exhalation port. Several new designs have emerged in the global healthcare community for the containment and filtration of potentially infectious particles. Other designs include the ISO-{{chem|O|2}} oxygen mask, the Flo<sub>2</sub>Max oxygen mask, and the O-Mask. The use of oxygen masks that are capable of filtering exhaled particles is gradually becoming a recommended practice for pandemic preparation in many jurisdictions.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\nTypical oxygen masks allow the person to breathe in room air in addition to their therapeutic oxygen, but because filtered oxygen masks use a closed design that minimizes or eliminates the person's contact with and ability to inhale room air, delivered oxygen concentrations to the person have been found to be higher, approaching 99% using adequate oxygen flows.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} Because all exhaled particles are contained within the mask, [[Nebulizer|nebulized]] medications are also prevented from being released into the surrounding atmosphere, decreasing the occupational exposure to healthcare staff and other people.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\n=== Aircraft ===\nIn the United States, most airlines restrict the devices allowed on board aircraft. As a result, passengers are restricted in what devices they can use. Some airlines will provide cylinders for passengers with an associated fee. Other airlines allow passengers to carry on approved portable concentrators. However, the lists of approved devices varies by airline so passengers need to check with any airline they are planning to fly on. Passengers are generally not allowed to carry on their own cylinders. In all cases, passengers need to notify the airline in advance of their equipment.\n\nEffective May 13, 2009, the Department of Transportation and FAA ruled that a select number of portable oxygen concentrators are approved for use on all commercial flights.<ref name=\"faa\">{{cite web|url=http://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/cabin_safety/portable_oxygen/|title=FAA Approved Portable Oxygen

Transfer from field care to definitive care, where oxygen use can be carefully calibrated, typically occurs long before significant reductions to the respiratory drive.\n\nA 2010 study has shown that titrated oxygen therapy (controlled administration of oxygen) is less of a danger to people with COPD and that other, non-COPD people, may also, in some cases, benefit more from titrated therapy.<ref name=\"tasmanian\" />\n\n===Fire risk===\nHighly concentrated sources of oxygen promote rapid combustion. Oxygen itself is not flammable, but the addition of concentrated oxygen to a fire greatly increases its intensity, and can aid the combustion of materials (such as metals) which are relatively inert under normal conditions.

The heat caused by rapid pressurization serves as the ignition source. For this reason, storage vessels, regulators, piping and any other equipment used with highly concentrated oxygen must be \"oxygen-clean\" prior to use, to ensure the absence of potential fuels. This does not apply only to pure oxygen; any concentration significantly higher than atmospheric (approximately 21%) carries a potential risk.\n\nHospitals in some jurisdictions, such as the UK, now operate \"no-smoking\" policies, which although introduced for other reasons, support the aim of keeping ignition sources away from medical piped oxygen. Recorded sources of ignition of medically prescribed oxygen include candles, aromatherapy, medical equipment, cooking, and unfortunately, deliberate vandalism. Smoking of pipes, cigars, and cigarettes is of special concern. These policies do not entirely eliminate the risk of injury with portable oxygen systems, especially if [[Compliance (medicine)|compliance]] is poor.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.medbc.com/annals/review/vol_19/num_2/text/vol19n2p99.asp|title=Home Oxygen Therapy and Cigarette Smoking: A Dangerous Practice|vauthors=Lindford AJ, Tehrani H, Sassoon EM, O'Neill TJ|journal=Annals of Burns and Fire Disasters|volume=19|issue=2|date=June 2006|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121220428/http://www.medbc.com/annals/review/vol_19/num_2/text/vol19n2p99.asp|archivedate=2008-11-21}}</ref>\n\n===Alternative medicine===\n\nSome practitioners of [[alternative medicine]] have promoted \"oxygen therapy\" as a cure for many human ailments including [[AIDS]], [[Alzheimer's disease]] and [[cancer]].

This is widely used at hospitals due to their high usage requirements, but can also be used in other settings. See [[Vacuum Insulated Evaporator]] for more information on this method of storage.\n#Compressed gas storage \u2013 The oxygen gas is compressed in a [[gas cylinder]], which provides a convenient storage, without the requirement for refrigeration found with liquid storage. Large oxygen cylinders hold {{convert|6500|l|cuft}} and can last about two days at a flow rate of 2 litres per minute.

In most cases, the oxygen will first pass through a [[pressure regulator]], used to control the high pressure of oxygen delivered from a cylinder (or other source) to a lower pressure. This lower pressure is then controlled by a [[flowmeter]], which may be preset or selectable, and this controls the flow in a measure such as litres per minute (lpm). The typical flowmeter range for medical oxygen is between 0 and 15 lpm with some units able to obtain up to 25 liters per minute. Many wall flowmeters using a [[Thorpe tube flowmeter|Thorpe tube]] design are able to be dialed to \"flush\" which is beneficial in emergency situations.\n\n===Low-dose oxygen===\nMany people only require a slight increase in oxygen in the air they breathe, rather than pure or near-pure oxygen.<ref>{{harvnb|Kallstrom|2002}}</ref> This can be delivered through a number of devices dependent on the situation, the flow required and in some instances person's preference.\n\nA [[nasal cannula]] (NC) is a thin tube with two small nozzles that protrude into the person's nostrils. It can only comfortably provide oxygen at low flow rates, 2\u20136 litres per minute (LPM), delivering a concentration of 24\u201340%.\n\nThere are also a number of face mask options, such as the [[simple face mask]], often used at between 5 and 8 LPM, with a concentration of oxygen to the person of between 28% and 50%. This is closely related to the more controlled [[air-entrainment masks]], also known as Venturi masks, which can accurately deliver a predetermined oxygen concentration to the trachea up to 40%.\n\nIn some instances, a partial rebreathing mask can be used, which is based on a simple mask, but featuring a reservoir bag, which increases the provided oxygen concentration to 40\u201370% oxygen at 5\u201315 LPM.\n\nNon-rebreather masks draw oxygen from attached reservoir bags, with one-way valves that direct exhaled air out of the mask. When properly fitted and used at flow rates of 8\u201310 LPM or higher, they deliver close to 100% oxygen. This type of mask is indicated for acute medical emergencies.\n\nDemand oxygen delivery systems (DODS) or oxygen resuscitators deliver oxygen only when the person inhales, or, in the case of a non-breathing person, the caregiver presses a button on the mask. These systems greatly conserve oxygen compared to steady-flow masks, which is useful in emergency situations when a limited supply of oxygen is available and there is a delay in transporting the person to higher care. They are very useful in performing [[CPR]], as the caregiver can deliver rescue breaths composed of 100% oxygen with the press of a button. Care must be taken not to over-inflate the person's lungs, and some systems employ safety valves to help prevent this. These systems may not be appropriate for people who are unconscious or those in respiratory distress, because of the effort required to breathe from them.\n\n===High flow oxygen delivery===\n\nIn cases where the person requires a high concentration of up to 100% oxygen, a number of devices are available, with the most common being the [[non-rebreather mask]] (or reservoir mask), which is similar to the partial rebreathing mask except it has a series of one-way valves preventing exhaled air from returning to the bag. There should be a minimum flow of 10 L/min.

Systems for delivering this vary in complexity (and cost), starting with a basic [[pocket mask]] adjunct which can be used by a basically trained first aider to manually deliver [[artificial respiration]] with supplemental oxygen delivered through a port in the mask.\n\nMany [[emergency medical service]] and [[first aid]] personnel, as well as hospitals, will use a [[bag-valve-mask]] (BVM), which is a malleable bag attached to a face mask (or invasive airway such as an [[endotracheal tube]] or [[laryngeal mask airway]]), usually with a reservoir bag attached, which is manually manipulated by the healthcare professional to push oxygen (or air) into the lungs. This is the only procedure allowed for initial treatment of [[cyanide poisoning]] in the [[UK]] workplace.<ref>[http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/misc076.htm Cyanide poisoning \u2013 New recommendations on first aid treatment] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091020204249/http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/misc076.htm |date=2009-10-20 }}</ref>\n\nAutomated versions of the BVM system, known as a [[resuscitator]] or pneupac can also deliver measured and timed doses of oxygen direct to people through a facemask or airway. These systems are related to the [[anaesthetic machine]]s used in operations under [[general anaesthesia]] that allows a variable amount of oxygen to be delivered, along with other gases including air, [[nitrous oxide]] and [[inhalational anaesthetic]]s.\n\n===As a drug delivery route===\nOxygen and other compressed gasses are used in conjunction with a [[nebulizer]] to allow the delivery of medications to the upper and/or lower airways. Nebulizers use compressed gas to propel liquid medication into an aerosol, with specific therapeutically sized droplets, for deposition in the appropriate, desired portion of the airway. A typical compressed gas flow rate of 8\u201310 L/min is used to [[nebulize]] medications, saline, sterile water, or a mixture of the preceding into a therapeutic aerosol for inhalation. In the clinical setting room air (ambient mix of several gasses), [[molecular oxygen]], and [[Heliox]]{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} are the most common gases used to nebulize a [[Bolus (medicine)|bolus]] or a continuous volume of therapeutic aerosols.\n\n===Exhalation filters for oxygen masks===\nFiltered oxygen masks have the ability to prevent exhaled, potentially infectious particles from being released into the surrounding environment. These masks are normally of a closed design such that leaks are minimized and breathing of room air is controlled through a series of one-way valves. Filtration of exhaled breaths is accomplished either by placing a filter on the exhalation port or through an integral filter that is part of the mask itself. These masks first became popular in the Toronto (Canada) healthcare community during the 2003 SARS Crisis. SARS was identified as being respiratory based and it was determined that conventional oxygen therapy devices were not designed for the containment of exhaled particles.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Hui DS, Hall SD, Chan MT, etal |title=Exhaled air dispersion during oxygen delivery via a simple oxygen mask |journal=Chest |volume=132 |issue=2 |pages=540\u201346 |date=August 2007 |pmid=17573505 |doi=10.1378/chest.07-0636 |url=http://www.chestjournal.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=17573505 |pmc=7094533 }}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal  |vauthors=Mardimae A, Slessarev M, Han J, etal |title=Modified N95 mask delivers high inspired oxygen concentrations while effectively filtering aerosolized microparticles |journal=Annals of Emergency Medicine |volume=48 |issue=4 |pages=391\u201399, 399.e1\u20132 |date=October 2006 |pmid=16997675 |doi=10.1016/j.annemergmed.2006.06.039 |url=|pmc=7118976 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Somogyi R, Vesely AE, Azami T, etal |title=Dispersal of respiratory droplets with open vs closed oxygen delivery masks: implications for the transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome |journal=Chest |volume=125 |issue=3 |pages=1155\u201357 |date=March 2004 |pmid=15006983 |url=http://www.chestjournal.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=15006983 |doi=10.1378/chest.125.3.1155 |pmc=7094599 }}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>  Common practices of having suspected people {{clarify|date=April 2016}} wear a surgical mask was confounded by the use of standard oxygen therapy equipment. In 2003, the HiOx<sup>80</sup> oxygen mask was released for sale. The HiOx<sup>80</sup> mask is a closed design mask that allows a filter to be placed on the exhalation port. Several new designs have emerged in the global healthcare community for the containment and filtration of potentially infectious particles. Other designs include the ISO-{{chem|O|2}} oxygen mask, the Flo<sub>2</sub>Max oxygen mask, and the O-Mask. The use of oxygen masks that are capable of filtering exhaled particles is gradually becoming a recommended practice for pandemic preparation in many jurisdictions.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\nTypical oxygen masks allow the person to breathe in room air in addition to their therapeutic oxygen, but because filtered oxygen masks use a closed design that minimizes or eliminates the person's contact with and ability to inhale room air, delivered oxygen concentrations to the person have been found to be higher, approaching 99% using adequate oxygen flows.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} Because all exhaled particles are contained within the mask, [[Nebulizer|nebulized]] medications are also prevented from being released into the surrounding atmosphere, decreasing the occupational exposure to healthcare staff and other people.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\n=== Aircraft ===\nIn the United States, most airlines restrict the devices allowed on board aircraft. As a result, passengers are restricted in what devices they can use. Some airlines will provide cylinders for passengers with an associated fee. Other airlines allow passengers to carry on approved portable concentrators. However, the lists of approved devices varies by airline so passengers need to check with any airline they are planning to fly on. Passengers are generally not allowed to carry on their own cylinders. In all cases, passengers need to notify the airline in advance of their equipment.\n\nEffective May 13, 2009, the Department of Transportation and FAA ruled that a select number of portable oxygen concentrators are approved for use on all commercial flights.<ref name=\"faa\">{{cite web|url=http://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/cabin_safety/portable_oxygen/|title=FAA Approved Portable Oxygen Concentrators \u2013 Positive Testing Results|publisher=faa.gov|accessdate=2014-06-22|quote=({{asof|2014|11}}) Positive Testing Results:  AirSep FreeStyle, AirSep LifeStyle, AirSep Focus, AirSep Freestyle 5, (Caire) SeQual eQuinox / Oxywell (model 4000), Delphi RS-00400 / Oxus RS-00400, DeVilbiss Healthcare iGo,  Inogen One,  Inogen One G2,  lnogen One G3,  lnova Labs LifeChoice Activox,  International Biophysics LifeChoice / lnova Labs LifeChoice, Invacare XPO2,  Invacare Solo 2,  Oxylife Independence Oxygen Concentrator, Precision Medical EasyPulse,  Respironics EverGo,  Respironics SimplyGo,  Sequal Eclipse,  SeQual SAROS,  VBox Trooper|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140702171156/http://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/cabin_safety/portable_oxygen/|archivedate=2014-07-02}}</ref> FAA regulations require larger airplanes to carry D-cylinders of oxygen for use in an emergency.\n\n==See also==\n* {{annotated link|Breathing gas}}\n* {{annotated link|Nebulizer}}\n* {{annotated link|Mechanical ventilation}}\n* {{annotated link|Hyperbaric oxygen therapy}}\n* {{annotated link|Oxygen bar}}\n* {{annotated link|Emergency medical services}}\n* {{annotated link|Respiratory therapist}}\n* {{annotated link|Oxygen tent}}\n* {{annotated link|Oxygen firebreak}}\n* {{annotated link|Bottled oxygen (climbing)}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist |colwidth=32em |refs=\n<ref name=tasmanian>{{cite journal |first1=Michael A |last1=Austin |first2=Karen E |last2=Wills |first3=Leigh |last3=Blizzard |first4=Eugene H |last4=Walters |first5=Richard |last5=Wood-Baker |date=18 October 2010 |title=Effect of high flow oxygen on mortality in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients in prehospital setting: randomised controlled trial |journal=British Medical Journal |volume=341 |issue=oct18 2 |page=c5462 |issn=0959-8138 |doi=10.1136/bmj.c5462 |url=http://www.bmj.com/content/341/bmj.c5462.full |pmc=2957540 |pmid=20959284 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101026174547/http://www.bmj.com/content/341/bmj.c5462.full |archivedate=26 October 2010 }}</ref>\n<!--Unused citation\n<ref name=ems1>{{cite web |url=http://www.ems1.com/medical-clinical/articles/905005-Study-Change-in-how-medics-use-oxygen-could-reduce-deaths/ |title=Study: Change in how medics use oxygen could reduce deaths |accessdate=2011-10-11}} (see comments for study meta-analysis)</ref>\n-->\n}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite journal |last=Kallstrom |first=TJ |title=American Association for Respiratory Care Clinical Practice Guideline: Oxygen therapy for adults in the acute care facility \u2013 2002 Revision & Update |journal=Respir Care |volume=47 |issue=6 |pages=717\u201320 |date=June 2002 |pmid=12078655 |url=http://www.rcjournal.com/cpgs/otachcpg-update.html |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite journal |author=Cahill Lambert AE |title=Adult domiciliary oxygen therapy: a patient's perspective |journal=The Medical Journal of Australia |volume=183 |issue=9 |pages=472\u201373 |date=November 2005 |pmid=16274348 |doi= 10.5694/j.1326-5377.2005.tb07125.x|url=http://www.mja.com.au/public/issues/183_09_071105/cah10501_fm.html}}\n\n{{Respiratory system procedures}}\n{{Cardiopulmonary therapy}}\n{{Underwater diving|divmed}}\n\n{{portal bar|Pharmacy and pharmacology|Medicine}}\n\n[[Category:Diving medicine]]\n[[Category:Medical treatments]]\n[[Category:Oxygen]]\n[[Category:Respiratory therapy]]\n[[Category:Industrial gases]]\n[[Category:World Health Organization essential medicines]]\n[[Category:RTT]]\n\n[[de:Sauerstofftherapie]]\n", "name_user": "Fswitzer4", "label": "safe", "comment": "added FDA UNII to drug box", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen_therapy"}

It is named after the [[Russian language|Russian]] term for the [[Dnieper]] river islet of today's [[Khortytsia|Seredny Stih]], [[Ukraine]], where it was first located. \n\n==Distribution==\nThe Sredny Stog culture was situated across the Dnieper river on both its shores, with sporadic settlements to the west and east.<ref>J. P. Mallory, ''In the search of Indo-Europeans'', 1989 p. 198, Distribution of the Sredny Stog and Novodanilovka sites</ref> \n\nThe Sredny Stog culture seems to have had contact with the agricultural [[Cucuteni-Trypillian culture]] in the west and was a contemporary of the [[Khvalynsk culture]], to the north-east.\n\n==Sites==\nOne of the best known sites associated with this culture is [[Dereivka]], located on the right bank of the Omelnik, a tributary of the Dnieper, and is the most impressive site within the Sredny Stog culture complex, being about 2,000 square meters in area.\n\n==Characteristics==\nThe Sredny Stog culture is known for initiating the domestication of horses.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Ancestral DNA, Human Origins, and Migrations|last=Herrera|first=Rene J.|last2=Garcia-Bertrand|first2=Ralph|date=2018|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=9780128041246|location=London|pages=518}}</ref>\n\nThe Sredny Stog people are distinguished from the other cultures found in the Balkans by the way they lived more mobile lives. This was seen in their temporary settlements, particularly their dwellings, which were simple rectilinear structures.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Balkan Prehistory: Exclusion, Incorporation and Identity|last=Bailey|first=Douglass|date=2002|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0415215978|location=London|pages=258|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe expert [[Dmytro Telegin]] has divided the chronology of Sredny Stog into two distinct phases. Phase II (ca. 4000\u20133500 BC) used [[Corded Ware culture|corded ware pottery]] which may have originated there, and stone battle-axes of the type later associated with expanding Indo-European cultures to the West. Most notably, it has perhaps the earliest evidence of [[horse domestication]] (in phase II), with finds suggestive of cheek-pieces ([[psalia]]). Evidence revealed that around 6,000ya, the culture has domesticated the wild Przewalski's horse.<ref name=\":0\" /> However, there is no conclusive proof that those horses were used for riding since they were mainly employed for gathering food.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Indo-European Language and Culture: An Introduction, Second Edition|last=Fortson IV|first=Benjamin|date=2011|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=9781405188951|location=Malden, MA|pages=48}}</ref>\n\n==Burials==\nIn its three largest cemeteries, Alexandria (39 individuals), Igren (17) and Dereivka (14), evidence of [[inhumation]] in flat graves (ground level pits) has been found.<ref>''The Journal of Indo-European studies'', Vol 18, p. 18</ref> This parallels the practise of the Cucuteni-Trypillian culture, and is in contrast with the later [[Yamna culture]], which practiced [[Tumulus|tumuli]] burials, according to the [[Kurgan hypothesis]]. \n\nIn Sredny Stog culture, the deceased were laid to rest on their backs with the legs flexed. The use of [[ochre]] in the burial was practiced, as with the kurgan cultures. For this and other reasons, Yuri Rassamakin suggests that the Sredny Stog culture should be considered as an areal term, with at least four distinct cultural elements co-existing inside the same geographical area.\n\n==Language== \nIn the context of the modified [[Kurgan hypothesis]] of [[Marija Gimbutas]], this pre-kurgan archaeological culture could represent the [[Urheimat]] (homeland) of the [[Proto-Indo-European language]]. \n\n==Physical type==\nExamination of physical remains of the Sredny Stog people has determined that they were [[Europoid]]. A similar physical type prevails among the Yamnaya, who were tall and powerfully built. People of the neighboring [[Khvalynsk culture]] were less powerfully built.{{Efn|\"[M]assive broad-faced proto-Europoid type is a trait of post-Mariupol\u2019 cultures, Sredniy Stog, as well as the Pit-grave culture of the Dnieper\u2019s left bank, the Donets, and Don. The features of this type are somewhat moderated in the western part of the steppe... All the anthropological types of the Pit-grave culture population have indigenous roots... The heir of the Neolithic Dnieper-Donets and Sredniy Stog cultures was the Pit-grave culture. Its population possessed distinct Europoid features, was tall, with massive skulls. The second component were the descendants of those buried in the Eneolithic cemetery of Khvalynsk. They are less robust.\"{{sfn|Kuzmina|2007|pp=383-384}} }} People of the preceding [[Dnieper-Donets culture]] were even more powerfully built than the Sredny Stog and Yamnaya.{{sfn|Mallory|1991|p=201}}\n\n==Genetics==\n{{See|Deriivka#Genetics}}\nA genetic study published in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' in February 2018 included an analysis of a male buried at Alexandria, Ukraine ca. 4000 BC.{{sfn|Mathieson|2018}} This site is ascribed to the Sredny Stog culture.{{sfn|Anthony|2019a|pp=16, 17}} He was found to be carrying the paternal [[Haplogroup R1a|haplogroup R1a1a1]] ([[Haplogroup R1a#R1a1a1b2 (R-Z93) (Asia)|R1a-Z93]], probably one of its earliest known members<ref>https://yfull.com/tree/R-Z93/</ref>){{sfn|Anthony|2019a|pp=16, 17}} and the maternal haplogroup [[Haplogroup H (mtDNA)#H2, H6 and H8|H2a1a]].{{sfn|Mathieson|2018}} He carried about 80% [[Western Steppe Herder]] (WSH) ancestry and about 20% [[Early European Farmer]] (EEF) ancestry.{{sfn|Anthony|2019a|pp=16, 17}} \n\nThe Sredny Stog male is the first steppe individual found to have been carrying EEF ancestry. As a carrier of the [[Lactase persistence#Genetics|13910]] allelle, he is the earliest individual ever examined who has had a genetic adaptation to [[lactase persistence]]. His R1a-Z93 paternal haplogroup is later found in the [[Sintashta culture]] and subsequent [[Indo-Iranians]].{{sfn|Anthony|2019b|pp=36-37}} The WHG genetic cluster was a result of mixing between [[Eastern Hunter-Gatherer]]s (EHGs) from Eastern Europe and [[Caucasian Hunter-Gatherer]]s (CHGs) from the Caucasus. This mixing appears to have happened on the eastern [[Pontic\u2013Caspian steppe]] starting around 5,000 BC.{{sfn|Anthony|2019a|pp=16, 17}} \n\nThe WSH ancestry found in the Sredny Stog culture is similar to that of the [[Khvalynsk culture]], among whom there was no EEF admixture. Males of the Khvalynsk culture carried primarily the paternal haplogroup [[Haplogroup R1b|R1b]], although a few samples of R1a, [[Haplogroup I-M438|I2a2]], [[Haplogroup Q-M242|Q1a]] and [[Haplogroup J (Y-DNA)|J]] have been detected. Succeeding Yamnaya males however, have been found to have carried only R1b and [[Haplogroup I-M438|I2]]. This is similar to the males of the Dnieper-Donets culture, who carried [[Haplogroup R (Y-DNA)|R]] and [[Haplogroup I-M170|I]] only and were exclusively EHGs with [[Western Hunter-Gatherer]] (WHG) admixture. The results suggest that the Yamnaya emerged through mixing between EHG and WHG males, and EEF and CHG females.

It is named after the [[Russian language|Russian]] term for the [[Dnieper]] river islet of today's [[Khortytsia|Seredny Stih]], [[Ukraine]], where it was first located. \n\n==Distribution==\nThe Sredny Stog culture was situated across the Dnieper river on both its shores, with sporadic settlements to the west and east.<ref>J. P. Mallory, ''In the search of Indo-Europeans'', 1989 p. 198, Distribution of the Sredny Stog and Novodanilovka sites</ref> \n\nThe Sredny Stog culture seems to have had contact with the agricultural [[Cucuteni-Trypillian culture]] in the west and was a contemporary of the [[Khvalynsk culture]], to the north-east.\n\n==Sites==\nOne of the best known sites associated with this culture is [[Dereivka]], located on the right bank of the Omelnik, a tributary of the Dnieper, and is the most impressive site within the Sredny Stog culture complex, being about 2,000 square meters in area.\n\n==Characteristics==\nThe Sredny Stog culture is known for initiating the domestication of horses.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Ancestral DNA, Human Origins, and Migrations|last=Herrera|first=Rene J.|last2=Garcia-Bertrand|first2=Ralph|date=2018|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=9780128041246|location=London|pages=518}}</ref>\n\nThe Sredny Stog people are distinguished from the other cultures found in the Balkans by the way they lived more mobile lives. This was seen in their temporary settlements, particularly their dwellings, which were simple rectilinear structures.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Balkan Prehistory: Exclusion, Incorporation and Identity|last=Bailey|first=Douglass|date=2002|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0415215978|location=London|pages=258|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe expert [[Dmytro Telegin]] has divided the chronology of Sredny Stog into two distinct phases. Phase II (ca. 4000\u20133500 BC) used [[Corded Ware culture|corded ware pottery]] which may have originated there, and stone battle-axes of the type later associated with expanding Indo-European cultures to the West. Most notably, it has perhaps the earliest evidence of [[horse domestication]] (in phase II), with finds suggestive of cheek-pieces ([[psalia]]). Evidence revealed that around 6,000ya, the culture has domesticated the wild Przewalski's horse.<ref name=\":0\" /> However, there is no conclusive proof that those horses were used for riding since they were mainly employed for gathering food.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Indo-European Language and Culture: An Introduction, Second Edition|last=Fortson IV|first=Benjamin|date=2011|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=9781405188951|location=Malden, MA|pages=48}}</ref>\n\n==Burials==\nIn its three largest cemeteries, Alexandria (39 individuals), Igren (17) and Dereivka (14), evidence of [[inhumation]] in flat graves (ground level pits) has been found.<ref>''The Journal of Indo-European studies'', Vol 18, p. 18</ref> This parallels the practise of the Cucuteni-Trypillian culture, and is in contrast with the later [[Yamna culture]], which practiced [[Tumulus|tumuli]] burials, according to the [[Kurgan hypothesis]]. \n\nIn Sredny Stog culture, the deceased were laid to rest on their backs with the legs flexed. The use of [[ochre]] in the burial was practiced, as with the kurgan cultures. For this and other reasons, Yuri Rassamakin suggests that the Sredny Stog culture should be considered as an areal term, with at least four distinct cultural elements co-existing inside the same geographical area.\n\n==Language== \nIn the context of the modified [[Kurgan hypothesis]] of [[Marija Gimbutas]], this pre-kurgan archaeological culture could represent the [[Urheimat]] (homeland) of the [[Proto-Indo-European language]]. \n\n==Physical type==\nExamination of physical remains of the Sredny Stog people has determined that they were [[Europoid]]. A similar physical type prevails among the Yamnaya, who were tall and powerfully built. People of the neighboring [[Khvalynsk culture]] were less powerfully built.{{Efn|\"[M]assive broad-faced proto-Europoid type is a trait of post-Mariupol\u2019 cultures, Sredniy Stog, as well as the Pit-grave culture of the Dnieper\u2019s left bank, the Donets, and Don. The features of this type are somewhat moderated in the western part of the steppe... All the anthropological types of the Pit-grave culture population have indigenous roots... The heir of the Neolithic Dnieper-Donets and Sredniy Stog cultures was the Pit-grave culture. Its population possessed distinct Europoid features, was tall, with massive skulls. The second component were the descendants of those buried in the Eneolithic cemetery of Khvalynsk. They are less robust.\"{{sfn|Kuzmina|2007|pp=383-384}} }} People of the preceding [[Dnieper-Donets culture]] were even more powerfully built than the Sredny Stog and Yamnaya.{{sfn|Mallory|1991|p=201}}\n\n==Genetics==\n{{See|Deriivka#Genetics}}\nA genetic study published in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' in February 2018 included an analysis of a male buried at Alexandria, Ukraine ca. 4000 BC.{{sfn|Mathieson|2018}} This site is ascribed to the Sredny Stog culture.{{sfn|Anthony|2019a|pp=16, 17}} He was found to be carrying the paternal [[Haplogroup R1a|haplogroup R1a1a1]] ([[Haplogroup R1a#R1a1a1b2 (R-Z93) (Asia)|R1a-Z93]], probably one of its earliest known members<ref>https://yfull.com/tree/R-Z93/</ref>){{sfn|Anthony|2019a|pp=16, 17}} and the maternal haplogroup [[Haplogroup H (mtDNA)#H2, H6 and H8|H2a1a]].{{sfn|Mathieson|2018}} He carried about 80% [[Western Steppe Herder]] (WSH) ancestry and about 20% [[Early European Farmer]] (EEF) ancestry.{{sfn|Anthony|2019a|pp=16, 17}} \n\nThe Sredny Stog male is the first steppe individual found to have been carrying EEF ancestry. As a carrier of the [[Lactase persistence#Genetics|13910]] allelle, he is the earliest individual ever examined who has had a genetic adaption to [[lactase persistence]]. His R1a-Z93 paternal haplogroup is later found in the [[Sintashta culture]] and subsequent [[Indo-Iranians]].{{sfn|Anthony|2019b|pp=36-37}} The WHG genetic cluster was a result of mixing between [[Eastern Hunter-Gatherer]]s (EHGs) from Eastern Europe and [[Caucasian Hunter-Gatherer]]s (CHGs) from the Caucasus. This mixing appears to have happened on the eastern [[Pontic\u2013Caspian steppe]] starting around 5,000 BC.{{sfn|Anthony|2019a|pp=16, 17}} \n\nThe WSH ancestry found in the Sredny Stog culture is similar to that of the [[Khvalynsk culture]], among whom there was no EEF admixture. Males of the Khvalynsk culture carried primarily the paternal haplogroup [[Haplogroup R1b|R1b]], although a few samples of R1a, [[Haplogroup I-M438|I2a2]], [[Haplogroup Q-M242|Q1a]] and [[Haplogroup J (Y-DNA)|J]] has been detected. Succeeding Yamnaya males however, have been found to be have only carried R1b and [[Haplogroup I-M438|I2]]. This is similar to the males of the Dnieper-Donets culture, who carried [[Haplogroup R (Y-DNA)|R]] and [[Haplogroup I-M170|I]] only and were exclusively EHGs with [[Western Hunter-Gatherer]] (WHG) admixture. The results suggest that the Yamnaya emerged through mixing between EHG and WHG males, and EEF and CHG females. This implies that the leading clans of the Yamnaya were of EHG paternal origin.{{sfn|Anthony|2019b|pp=36}} On this basis, [[David W.

professional [[snooker]] player who dominated the game throughout the 1960s.\n\n== Career ==\nPulman won the 1946 English Amateur title and turned professional shortly afterwards.<ref

}}</ref> In [[1947 World Snooker Championship|1947]] he had his first appearance at the World Championship, losing 14-21 to Albert Brown in the first round of qualification. The next season, he won the qualifying section of the [[1948 World Snooker Championship|World Snooker Championship]]. In the [[1948 Sunday Empire News Tournament]] he won the qualifying event and finished second in the main event behind [[Joe Davis]]. Pulman won a total of \u00a3400; \u00a3150 for the qualifying and \u00a3250 for finishing second.\n\nHe first reached the final of the [[World Professional Match-play Championship]] in 1955, losing to [[Fred Davis (snooker player)|Fred Davis]]. Davis beat him again in the 1956 final, but Davis did not enter in 1957 and Pulman won the title, after which the event was discontinued. In 1964 the [[World Snooker Championship|World Championship]] was resumed on a challenge basis.<ref name=\"IOBIT\" /> Pulman won the championship and successfully defended it in all further title challenges, the last being in 1968 when he beat the Australian [[Eddie Charlton]]. In 1969 the World Championship became a knockout tournament (which is generally regarded as the birth of the modern snooker era) and Pulman failed to successfully defend his title. He reached the final in 1970 but lost to [[Ray Reardon]]. Pulman reached the semi-finals of the World Championship when it was first held at the [[Crucible Theatre]] in Sheffield in 1977, narrowly losing to the eventual winner [[John Spencer (snooker player)|John Spencer]] by 18 frames to 16.<ref name=\"GUINNESS\" />\n\nAfter a poor run of results, Pulman was adjudged bankrupt on 7 February 1979 with debts of \u00a35,916. By this time he was recently divorced, suffering from severe motivational problems and living in a hotel in [[Bromley]].<ref>Everton, Clive (Ed.)

Born in [[Baltimore County, Maryland]], to a free African-American woman and a former [[slavery|slave]], Banneker had little formal education and was largely self-taught. He is known for being part of a group led by [[Andrew Ellicott (surveyor)|Major Andrew Ellicott]] that surveyed the original borders of the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]], the federal capital district of the [[United States]].\n\nBanneker's knowledge of [[astronomy]] helped him author a commercially successful series of almanacs. He corresponded with [[Thomas Jefferson]] on the topics of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] and [[racial equality]], Jefferson having earlier [[Draft document|draft]]ed the [[United States Declaration of Independence]]. [[Abolitionism in the United States|Abolitionist]]s and advocates of racial equality promoted and praised Banneker's works.\n\nAlthough a fire on the day of Banneker's funeral destroyed many of his papers and belongings, one of his journals and several of his remaining [[Cultural artifact|artifacts]] are presently available for public viewing. Parks, schools, streets and other tributes have commemorated Banneker throughout the years since he lived. However, many accounts of his life exaggerate or falsely attribute his works.\n\n==Early life==\nBenjamin Banneker was born on November 9, 1731, in Baltimore County, Maryland to Mary Banneky, a free black, and Robert, a [[Freedman|freed slave]] from [[Guinea]].<ref name=Bedini2008>[http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Benjamin_Banneker.aspx Bedini, 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203192640/http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Benjamin_Banneker.aspx |date=2016-02-03}}</ref> There are two conflicting accounts of Banneker's family history.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District.

BENJAMIN BANNEKER, a free black, is about fifty-nine years of age; he was born in Baltimore county; his father was an African, and his mother the offspring of African parents. \u2013  His father and mother having obtained their freedom, were enabled to send him to an obscure school, where he learned, when a boy, reading, writing, and arithmetic as far as double position; and to leave him, at their deaths, a few acres of land, upon which he has supported himself ever since by means of economy and constant labour, and preserved a fair reputation. To struggle incessantly against want is no ways favourable to improvement: what he had learned, however, he did not forget; for as some hours of leisure will occur in the most toilsome life, he availed himself of these, not to read and acquire knowledge from writings of genius and discovery, for of such he had none, but to digest and apply, as occasions presented, the few principles of the few rules of arithmetic he had been taught at school. This kind of mental exercise formed his chief amusement, and soon gave him a facility in calculation that was often serviceable to his neighbours, and at length attracted the attention of the Messrs. Ellicott, a family remarkable for their ingenuity and turn to the useful mechanics. It is about three years since Mr. George Ellicott lent him Mayer's Tables, Ferguson's Astronomy, Leadbeater's Lunar Tables, and some astronomic instruments, but without accompanying them with either hint or instruction, that might further his studies, or lead him to apply them to any useful result. These books and instruments, the first of the kind he had ever seen, opened a new world to Benjamin, and from thenceforward he employed his leisure in astronomical researches. He now took up the idea of the calculations for an Almanack, and actually completed an entire set for the last year, upon his original stock of arithmetic.

On his instruction, the astronomical journal and some other loose manuscripts were removed upon his death and left to George Ellicott (1760\u20131832). The journal stayed in the hands of the Ellicott family until 1844 when it was deposited here at MdHS, where it was used by John H.B. Latrobe the following year. Quaker philanthropist and MdHS member [[Moses Sheppard]] (1771\u20131857) had the book rebound in Russian leather in 1852, and at this date most likely combined the astronomical journal with some of Banneker's loose manuscripts as well as a day book. At some unknown date the astronomical journal left MdHS and returned to the hands of the Ellicott family. It stayed there, away from the public's eye until 1987 when Ellicott family descendant Dorothea West Fitzhugh donated it in honor of her late husband Robert Tyson Fitzhugh.

Born in [[Baltimore County, Maryland]], to a free African-American woman and a former [[slavery|slave]], Banneker had little formal education and was largely self-taught. He is known for being part of a group led by [[Andrew Ellicott (surveyor)|Major Andrew Ellicott]] that surveyed the original borders of the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]], the federal capital district of the [[United States]].\n\nBanneker's knowledge of [[astronomy]] helped him author a commercially successful series of almanacs. He corresponded with [[Thomas Jefferson]] on the topics of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] and [[racial equality]], Jefferson having earlier [[Draft document|draft]]ed the [[United States Declaration of Independence]]. [[Abolitionism in the United States|Abolitionist]]s and advocates of racial equality promoted and praised Banneker's works.\n\nAlthough a fire on the day of Banneker's funeral destroyed many of his papers and belongings, one of his journals and several of his remaining [[Cultural artifact|artifacts]] are presently available for public viewing. Parks, schools, streets and other tributes have commemorated Banneker throughout the years since he lived. However, many accounts of his life exaggerate or falsely attribute his works.\n\n==Early life==\nBenjamin Banneker was born on November 9, 1731, in Baltimore County, Maryland to Mary Banneky, a free black, and Robert, a [[Freedman|freed slave]] from [[Guinea]].<ref name=Bedini2008>[http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Benjamin_Banneker.aspx Bedini, 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203192640/http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Benjamin_Banneker.aspx |date=2016-02-03}}</ref> There are two conflicting accounts of Banneker's family history.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District. All available testimony shows that he was present only during the few weeks early in 1791 when the rough preliminary survey of the ten mile square was made; that, after this was concluded and before the final survey was begun, he returned to his farm and his astronomical studies in April, accompanying Ellicott part way on his brief journey back to Philadelphia; and that thenceforth he had no connection with the mapping of the seat of government. ...<br>In any case, Banneker's participation in the surveying of the Federal District was unquestionably brief and his role uncertain.}}</ref> An April 21, 1791, news report of the April 15 dedication ceremony for the first boundary stone (the south cornerstone) stated that it was Andrew Ellicott who \"ascertained the precise point from which the first line of the district was to proceed\".<ref>(1) {{cite news|location=Boston, Massachusetts|publisher=Benjamin Russell|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630220952/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|archivedate=2016-06-30|url=http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|title=New Federal City|work=Columbian Centennial|number=744|date=1791-05-07|accessdate=2016-10-09|quote=When Mr. Ellicott had ascertained the precise point from which the line of the district was to proceed, the Master of the Lodge and Dr. Stewart, assisted by others of their brethren placed the stone; ... |via=[http://www.boundarystones.org boundarystones.org]}}<br />(2) Bedini, 1972, pp. [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/124/mode/1up 124],  [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/314/mode/1up 314]</ref>  The news report did not mention Banneker's name.<ref>(1) [https://web.archive.org/web/20130322112050/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf Bedini, 1969, p. 25.]<br>(2) {{cite news|location=Boston, Massachusetts|publisher=Benjamin Russell|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630220952/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|archivedate=2016-06-30|url=http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|title=New Federal City|work=Columbian Centennial|number=744|date=1791-05-07|accessdate=2016-10-09|via=[http://www.boundarystones.org boundarystones.org}}]</ref>\n\nBanneker left the boundary survey in April 1791 within three months of its initiation because of concerns about his health and the difficulties in completing the survey at age 59.<ref name=Bedini136>Bedini, 1999, pp. [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/132/mode/1up 132],  [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/136/mode/1up 136].</ref> In addition, Andrew Ellicott's younger brothers, [[Benjamin Ellicott|Benjamin]] and [[Joseph Ellicott]], who usually assisted Andrew, were able to join the survey at that time.<ref name=Bedini136/> \n\nBanneker therefore returned to his home near Ellicott's Mills.<ref name=Glawe/><ref name=Bedini136/> The Ellicotts and other members of the surveying team then laid the remaining Virginia marker stones later in 1791.

BENJAMIN BANNEKER, a free black, is about fifty-nine years of age; he was born in Baltimore county; his father was an African, and his mother the offspring of African parents. \u2013  His father and mother having obtained their freedom, were enabled to send him to an obscure school, where he learned, when a boy, reading, writing, and arithmetic as far as double position; and to leave him, at their deaths, a few acres of land, upon which he has supported himself ever since by means of economy and constant labour, and preserved a fair reputation. To struggle incessantly against want is no ways favourable to improvement: what he had learned, however, he did not forget; for as some hours of leisure will occur in the most toilsome life, he availed himself of these, not to read and acquire knowledge from writings of genius and discovery, for of such he had none, but to digest and apply, as occasions presented, the few principles of the few rules of arithmetic he had been taught at school. This kind of mental exercise formed his chief amusement, and soon gave him a facility in calculation that was often serviceable to his neighbours, and at length attracted the attention of the Messrs. Ellicott, a family remarkable for their ingenuity and turn to the useful mechanics. It is about three years since Mr. George Ellicott lent him Mayer's Tables, Ferguson's Astronomy, Leadbeater's Lunar Tables, and some astronomic instruments, but without accompanying them with either hint or instruction, that might further his studies, or lead him to apply them to any useful result. These books and instruments, the first of the kind he had ever seen, opened a new world to Benjamin, and from thenceforward he employed his leisure in astronomical researches. He now took up the idea of the calculations for an Almanack, and actually completed an entire set for the last year, upon his original stock of arithmetic. Encouraged by this first attempt, he entered upon his calculation for 1792, which, as well as the former, he began and finished without the least information of assistance from any person, or other books than those I have mentioned; so that whatever merit is attached to his present performance, is exclusively and peculiarly his own. I have been the more careful to investigate those particulars, and to ascertain their reality, as they form an interesting fact in the History of Man; and as you may want them to gratify curiosity, I have no objection to your selecting them for your account of Benjamin.\"<br>(5) {{cite book|title=Letter from James McHenry regarding Benjamin Banneker|location=Baltimore, April 20, 1791}} ''In''  [https://books.google.com/books?id=LSkkCeq5R1AC&pg=PA114#v=onepage&q&f=false Phillips, pp. 115\u2013116] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160517183823/https://books.google.com/books?id=LSkkCeq5R1AC&pg=PA114#v=onepage&q&f=false |date=2016-05-17 }}. \"The following notice of Banneker is found, first published in his almanac for 1792, and republished with some abridgement in the one of 1793, from which we are making extracts.

On his instruction, the astronomical journal and some other loose manuscripts were removed upon his death and left to George Ellicott (1760\u20131832). The journal stayed in the hands of the Ellicott family until 1844 when it was deposited here at MdHS, where it was used by John H.B. Latrobe the following year. Quaker philanthropist and MdHS member [[Moses Sheppard]] (1771\u20131857) had the book rebound in Russian leather in 1852, and at this date most likely combined the astronomical journal with some of Banneker's loose manuscripts as well as a day book. At some unknown date the astronomical journal left MdHS and returned to the hands of the Ellicott family. It stayed there, away from the public's eye until 1987 when Ellicott family descendant Dorothea West Fitzhugh donated it in honor of her late husband Robert Tyson Fitzhugh.
