{"title_page": "NASA spinoff technologies", "text_new": "{{hatnote|Spinoff technologies originating with the US Space Agency}}\nKing AaronDanielKaatz \n'''NASA spinoff technologies''' are commercial products and services which have been developed with the help of [[NASA]], through research and development contracts, such as [[Small Business Innovation Research]] (SBIR) or [[Small Business Technology Transfer Program|STTR]] awards, licensing of NASA patents, use of NASA facilities, technical assistance from NASA personnel, or data from NASA research. Information on new NASA technology that may be useful to industry is available in periodical and website form in \"NASA Tech Briefs\", while successful examples of commercialization are reported annually in the NASA publication \"Spinoffs\". The Spinoff publication has documented more than 2,000 technologies over time.\n\nIn 1979, notable [[science fiction]] author [[Robert A. Heinlein]] helped bring awareness to the spinoffs when he was asked to appear before [[United States Congress|Congress]] after recovering from one of the earliest known [[vascular bypass]] operations to correct a blocked artery; in his testimony, reprinted in his 1980 book ''[[Expanded Universe (Heinlein)|Expanded Universe]]'', he claimed that four NASA spinoff technologies made the surgery possible, and it was a few from a long list of NASA spinoff technologies from space development.<ref>{{cite document|title=Applications of space technology for the elderly and handicapped joint hearings before the Select Committee on Aging and the Committee on Science and Technology, U.S. House of Representatives, Ninety-sixth Congress, first session, July 19 and 20, 1979.|date=20 July 1979|publisher=U.S. Congress|hdl = 2027/mdp.39015083085392}}</ref>\n\nSince 1976,<ref>[https://spinoff.nasa.gov/Spinoff2019/index.html NASA Spinoff 2019] Retrieved August 1, 2019</ref> the NASA Technology Transfer Program<ref>{{cite web|title=NASA Technology Transfer Portal|url=http://technology.nasa.gov}}</ref> has connected [[NASA]] resources to private industry, referring to the commercial products as spinoffs. Well-known products that NASA claims as spinoffs include [[memory foam]] (originally named temper foam), [[freeze-dried food]], firefighting equipment, emergency \"[[space blanket]]s\", [[DustBuster]]s, [[cochlear implant]]s, [[LZR Racer]] swimsuits, and [[Active pixel sensor|CMOS image sensors]]. As of 2016, NASA has published over 2,000 other spinoffs in the fields of computer technology, environment and agriculture, health and medicine, public safety, transportation, recreation, and industrial productivity.  Contrary to common belief, NASA did not invent [[Tang (drink)|Tang]], [[Velcro]] or [[Teflon]].<ref name=\"spinfaq\">{{cite web|url=http://spinoff.nasa.gov/spinfaq.htm|title=Spinoff Frequently Asked Questions |work=NASA.gov|accessdate=2014-11-19|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141125001441/http://spinoff.nasa.gov/spinfaq.htm|archivedate=2014-11-25}}</ref>\n\n==History of the ''Spinoff'' publication==\n''Spinoff'' is a NASA publication featuring technology made available to the public. Since 1976, NASA has featured an average of 50 technologies each year in the annual publication, and ''Spinoff'' maintains a searchable database of these technologies. When products first spun off from space research, NASA presented a black and white report in 1973, titled the \"Technology Utilization Program Report\". Because of interest in the reports, NASA decided to create the annual publications in color. ''Spinoff'' was first published in 1976,<ref name=Spinoff1976 /> and since then, NASA has distributed free copies to universities, the media, inventors and the general public. ''Spinoff'' describes how NASA works with various industries and small businesses to bring new technology to the public. As of 2016, there were over 1,920 ''Spinoff'' products in the database dating back to 1976.<ref>{{cite web|last=NASA Spinoff Database|url=http://spinoff.nasa.gov/spinoff/database|publisher=National Aeronautics and Space Administration|title=NASA Spinoff Database|date=December 5, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Health and medicine==\n\n===Infrared ear thermometers===\nDiatek Corporation and NASA developed an [[Infrared thermometer|aural thermometer]] that measures the [[thermal radiation]] emitted by the [[eardrum]], similar to the way the temperature of stars and planets are measured. This method avoids contact with mucous membranes and permits rapid temperature measurement of newborn or incapacitated patients. NASA supported the Diatek Corporation through the Technology Affiliates Program.<ref name=Spinoff1991>{{cite book\n | author = NASA | title = Spinoff | location = Washington, DC | publisher = U.S. Government Printing Office\n | date = 1991 | url = http://www.sti.nasa.gov/tto/back_issues_archives/1991.pdf }}</ref>\n\n===Ventricular assist device===\nCollaboration between NASA, Dr. Michael DeBakey, Dr. George Noon, and MicroMed Technology Inc. resulted in a heart pump for patients awaiting heart transplants. The MicroMed DeBakey ventricular assist device (VAD) functions as a \"bridge to heart transplant\" by pumping blood until a donor heart is available. The pump is approximately one-tenth the size of other currently marketed pulsatile VADs. Because of the pump's small size, fewer patients developed device-related infections. It can operate up to 8 hours on batteries, giving patients the mobility to do normal, everyday activities.<ref name=Spinoff2002>{{cite book\n | author = NASA\n | title = Spinoff\n | location = Washington, DC\n | publisher = U.S. Government Printing Office\n | date = 2002\n | url = http://www.sti.nasa.gov/tto/spinoff2002/index.html\n | isbn = 0-16-077275-3}}</ref>\n\n===LASIK===\n[[LASIK]] technology comes from the 1980s efforts for autonomous rendezvous and docking of space vehicles to service satellites. Eventually a range and velocity imaging [[LADAR]] was demonstrated that could be used for docking spacecraft. LADAR was also used in military and NASA-sponsored research for applications in strategic target tracking and weapons firing control. LASIK technology is used by [[ophthalmologists]] to track eye movements at a rate of 4,000 times per second while reshaping the cornea, the clear front surface of the eye, using a laser.<ref name=Spinoff2003>{{cite book\n | author = NASA\n | title = NASA space station \n | location = Washington, DC\n | publisher = U.S. Government Printing \n | date = 2003\n | url = http://www.sti.nasa.gov/tto/Spinoff2003/index.html\n | isbn = }}</ref>\n\n===Cochlear implants===\nNASA engineer Adam Kissiah started working in the mid-1970s on what could become the [[cochlear implant]], a device that provides hearing sensation to people that receive little to no benefit from hearing aids. Kissiah used his knowledge learned while working as an electronics instrumentation engineer at NASA. This work took place over three years, when Kissiah would spend his lunch breaks and evenings in NASA's technical library, studying the impact of engineering principles on the inner ear. In 1977, NASA helped Kissiah obtain a patent for the cochlear implant.<ref name=Spinoff2003/>\n\n===Artificial limbs===\n\nNASA's continued funding, coupled with its collective innovations in robotics and shock-absorption/comfort materials are inspiring and enabling the private sector to create new and better solutions for animal and human prostheses. Advancements such as Environmental Robots Inc.'s development of artificial muscle systems with robotic sensing and actuation capabilities for use in NASA space robotic and extravehicular activities are being adapted in order to create more functionally dynamic artificial limbs.<ref name=Spinoff2004/>\n\nAdditionally, other private-sector adaptations of NASA's temper foam technology have brought about custom-moldable materials offering the natural look and feel of flesh, as well as preventing friction between the skin and the prosthesis, and heat/moisture buildup.<ref name=Spinoff2005/>\n\n===Light-emitting diodes in medical therapies===\nAfter initial experiments using [[light-emitting diode]]s in NASA space shuttle plant growth experiments, NASA issued a small business innovation grant that led to the development of a hand-held, high-intensity, LED unit developed by Quantum Devices Inc. that can be used to treat tumors after other treatment options are depleted.<ref name=Spinoff2005>{{cite book\n | author = NASA\n | title = Spinoff\n | location = Washington, DC\n | publisher = U.S. Government Printing Office\n | date = 2005\n | url = http://www.sti.nasa.gov/tto/Spinoff2005/index.html\n | isbn = 0-16-075266-3}}</ref>{{rp|10\u201311}}\nThis therapy was approved by the FDA and inducted into the [[Space Foundation]]'s Space Technology Hall of Fame in 2000.\n\n===Invisible braces===\nInvisible braces are a type of [[transparent ceramics]] called translucent polycrystalline alumina (TPA).

Thermawing allows pilots to safely fly through ice encounters and provides pilots of single-engine aircraft the heated wing technology usually reserved for larger, jet-powered craft. Thermacool, an electric air conditioning system, uses a new compressor whose rotary pump design runs off an energy-efficient, brushless DC motor and allows pilots to use the air conditioner before the engine starts.<ref name=Spinoff2007>{{cite book\n | author = NASA\n | title = Spinoff\n | location = Washington, DC\n | publisher = U.S. Government Printing Office\n | date = 2007\n | url = https://archive.org/details/spinoff20070000grif\n | isbn = 978-0-16-079740-8\n | url-access = registration\n }}</ref>\n\n===Highway safety===\nSafety grooving, the cutting of grooves in concrete to increase traction and prevent injury, was first developed to reduce aircraft accidents on wet runways. Represented by the International Grooving and Grinding Association, the industry expanded into highway and pedestrian applications. Safety grooving originated at Langley Research Center, which assisted in testing the grooving at airports and on highways. Skidding was reduced, stopping distance decreased, and a vehicle's cornering ability on curves was increased. The process has been extended to animal holding pens, parking lots, and other potentially slippery surfaces.<ref name=Spinoff1985>{{cite book\n | author = NASA\n | title = Spinoff\n | location = Washington, DC\n | publisher = U.S. Government Printing Office\n | date = 1986\n | url = http://www.sti.nasa.gov/tto/back_issues_archives/1985.pdf\n | isbn = }}</ref>\n\n===Improved radial tires===\nGoodyear Tire and Rubber Company developed a fibrous material, five times stronger than steel, for NASA to use in parachute shrouds to soft-land the [[Viking Lander]] spacecraft on the Martian surface. Recognizing the durability of the material, Goodyear expanded the technology and went on to produce a new radial tire with a tread life expected to be {{convert|10000|mi}} greater than conventional radials.<ref name=Spinoff1976>{{cite book\n | author = NASA\n | title = Spinoff\n | location = Washington, DC\n | publisher = U.S. Government Printing Office\n | date = 1976\n | url = http://www.sti.nasa.gov/tto/back_issues_archives/1976.pdf\n | isbn = }}</ref>\n\n===Chemical detection===\nNASA contracted with Intelligent Optical Systems (IOS) to develop moisture- and pH-sensitive sensors to warn of corrosive conditions in aircraft before damage occurs. This sensor changes color in response to contact with its target. After completing the work with NASA, IOS was tasked by the U.S. Department of Defense to further develop the sensors for detecting chemical warfare agents and potential threats, such as toxic industrial compounds and nerve agents. IOS has sold the chemically sensitive fiber optic cables to major automotive and aerospace companies, who are finding a variety of uses for the devices such as aiding experimentation with nontraditional power sources, and as an economical \"alarm system\" for detecting chemical release in large facilities.<ref name=Spinoff2007 />\n\n==Public safety==\n\n===Video enhancing and analysis systems===\nIntergraph Government Solutions developed its Video Analyst System (VAS) by building on Video Image Stabilization and Registration (VISAR) technology created by NASA to help FBI agents analyze video footage. Originally used for enhancing video images from nighttime videotapes made with hand-held camcorders, VAS is a tool for video enhancement and analysis offering support of full-resolution digital video, stabilization, frame-by-frame analysis, conversion of analog video to digital storage formats, and increased visibility of filmed subjects without altering underlying footage. Aside from law enforcement and security applications, VAS has also been adapted to serve the military for reconnaissance, weapons deployment, damage assessment, training, and mission debriefing.<ref name=Spinoff2001>{{cite book\n | author = NASA\n | title = Spinoff\n | location = Washington, DC\n | publisher = U.S. Government Printing Office\n | date = 2001\n | url=http://www.sti.nasa.gov/tto/spinoff2001/index.html\n | isbn = }}</ref>\n\n===Landmine removal===\n[[Thiokol]] has used surplus rocket fuel through an agreement with NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center to produce a flare that can safely destroy landmines. The fuel that is left unused from a launch will become a solid, which cannot be reused but can be used as an ingredient needed to create the Demining Device flare. The Demining Device flare uses a battery-triggered electric match to ignite and neutralize land mines in the field without detonation. The flare uses the solid rocket fuel to burn a hole in a mine's case and burns away the explosive contents so the mine can be disarmed without hazard.<ref name=Spinoff2000/>\n\n===Fire-resistant reinforcement===\nBuilt and designed by Avco Corporation, the Apollo heat shield was coated with a material whose purpose was to burn and thus dissipate energy during reentry while charring, to form a protective coating to block heat penetration. NASA subsequently funded Avco's development of other applications of the heat shield, such as fire-retardant paints and foams for aircraft, which led to an intumescent epoxy material, which expands in volume when exposed to heat or flames, acting as an insulating barrier and dissipating heat through burn-off. Further innovations include steel coatings devised to make high-rise buildings and public structures safer by swelling to provide a tough and stable insulating layer over the steel for up to 4 hours of fire protection, ultimately to slow building collapse and provide more time for escape.<ref name=Spinoff2006>{{cite book\n | author = NASA\n | title = Spinoff\n | location = Washington, DC\n | publisher = U.S. Government Printing Office\n | date = 2006\n | url=http://www.sti.nasa.gov/tto/Spinoff2006/index.html\n | isbn = }}</ref>\n\n===Firefighting equipment===\nFirefighting equipment in the United States is based on lightweight materials developed for the U.S. Space Program. NASA and the National Bureau of Standards created a lightweight breathing system including face mask, frame, harness, and air bottle, using an aluminum composite material developed by NASA for use on rocket casings. The broadest fire-related technology transfer is the breathing apparatus for protection from smoke inhalation injury.\n\nAdditionally, NASA's inductorless electronic circuit technology led to lower-cost, more rugged, short-range two-way radio now used by firefighters. NASA also helped develop a specialized mask weighing less than {{convert|3|oz}} to protect the physically impaired from injuries to the face and head, as well as flexible, heat-resistant materials\u2014developed to protect the space shuttle on reentry\u2014which are being used both by the military and commercially in suits for municipal and aircraft-rescue firefighters.<ref name=Spinoff1978>{{cite book\n | author = NASA\n | title = Spin-off\n | location = Washington, DC\n | publisher = U.S. Government Printing Office\n | date = 1978\n | url = http://www.sti.nasa.gov/tto/back_issues_archives/1978.pdf\n | isbn = }}</ref><ref name=Spinoff1981>{{cite book\n | author = NASA\n | title = Spin-off\n | location = Washington, DC\n | publisher = U.S. Government Printing Office\n | date = 1981\n | url = http://www.sti.nasa.gov/tto/back_issues_archives/1981.pdf\n | isbn = }}</ref><ref name=Spinoff1982>{{cite book\n | author = NASA\n | title = Spin-off\n | location = Washington, DC\n | publisher = U.S. Government Printing Office\n | date = 1982\n | url = http://www.sti.nasa.gov/tto/back_issues_archives/1982.pdf\n | isbn = }}</ref><ref name=Spinoff2000>{{cite book\n | author = NASA\n | title = Spin-off\n | location = Washington, DC\n | publisher = U.S. Government Printing Office\n | date = 2000\n | url=http://www.sti.nasa.gov/tto/spinoff2000/index.htm\n | isbn = }}</ref>\n\n===Shock absorbers for buildings===\nWith NASA funding, Taylor Devices Inc. developed shock absorbers that could safely remove the fuel and electrical connectors from the Space Shuttles during launch. These absorbers are being used as seismic shock absorbers to protect buildings from earthquakes in places like Tokyo and San Francisco.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://spinoff.nasa.gov/database/spinoffDetail.php?this=/spinoff//msfc/MSFC-SO-215|title=NASA Spinoff Database|website=spinoff.nasa.gov}}</ref>\n\n==Consumer, home, and recreation==\n\n===TEMPUR foam===\n[[Image:Temperfoam1-2005.jpg|thumbnail|right|Initially referred to as \"slow spring back foam\", TEMPUR foam matches pressure against it and slowly returns to its original form once the pressure is removed.]]\n\nAs the result of a program designed to develop a padding concept to improve crash protection for airplane passengers, Ames Research Center developed what is now called memory foam. Memory foam, or \"TEMPUR Foam\", has been incorporated into mattresses, pillows, military and civilian aircraft, automobiles and motorcycles, sports safety equipment, amusement park rides and arenas, horseback saddles, archery targets, furniture, and human and animal prostheses. Its high-energy absorption and soft characteristics offer protection and comfort.

The substance, formulated into the products life'sDHA and life'sARA and based on microalgae, can be found in over 90% of the infant formulas sold in the United States, and are added to infant formulas in over 65 other countries. Martek Biosciences Corporation's founders and principal scientists acquired their expertise in this area while working on the NASA program. This program was support by theorist, Mikkel Juelsgaard Poulsen.  The microalgae food supplement was inducted into the [[Space Foundation]] Space Technology Hall of Fame in 2009.<ref name=Spinoff1996>{{cite book\n | author = NASA\n | title = Spinoff\n | location = Washington, DC\n | publisher = U.S. Government Printing Office\n | date = 1996\n | url=http://www.sti.nasa.gov/tto/spinoff1996/index.html\n | isbn = }}</ref>\n\n===Portable cordless vacuums===\nFor the Apollo space mission, NASA required a portable, self-contained drill capable of extracting core samples from below the lunar surface. [[Black & Decker]] was tasked with the job, and developed a computer program to optimize the design of the drill's motor and ensure minimal power consumption. That computer program led to the development of a cordless miniature vacuum cleaner called the DustBuster.<ref name=Spinoff1981 />\n\n===Freeze drying===\nIn planning for the long-duration Apollo missions, NASA conducted extensive research into space food. One of the techniques developed in 1938 by Nestl\u00e9 was [[freeze drying]]. In the United States, Action Products later commercialized this technique for other foods, concentrating on snack food resulting in products like [[Space ice cream]]. The foods are cooked, quickly frozen, and then slowly heated in a vacuum chamber to remove the ice crystals formed by the freezing process. The final product retains 98% {{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} of its nutrition and weighs much less than before drying.  The ratio of weight before and after drying depends strongly on the particular food item but a typical freeze-dried weight is 20% of the original weight.\n\nToday, one of the benefits of this advancement in food preservation includes simple, nutritious meals available to disabled and otherwise homebound senior adults unable to take advantage of existing meal programs.<ref name=Spinoff1978 /><ref name=Spinoff1980 /><ref name=Spinoff1994>{{cite book\n | author = NASA\n | title = Spinoff\n | location = Washington, DC\n | publisher = U.S. Government Printing Office\n | date = 1994\n | url = http://www.sti.nasa.gov/tto/back_issues_archives/1994.pdf\n | isbn = }}</ref>\n\n===Space age swimsuit===\nLangley Research Center's wind tunnel testing facilities and fluid flow analysis software supported [[Speedo]]'s design of a space age-enriched swimsuit.

Fossum invented [[CMOS]] image sensors that have become NASA's most ubiquitous spinoff technology, enabling the use of [[digital cameras]] in mobile phones ([[camera phones]]). Fossum found a way to reduce the signal noise that had plagued earlier attempts at CMOS imagers, applying a technique called intra-pixel charge transfer with correlated double sampling that results in a clearer image. This led to the creation of CMOS [[active pixel sensor]]s, which are used today in all [[smartphone]] cameras and many other applications.<ref>{{cite web|title=CMOS Sensors Enable Phone Cameras, HD Video|url=https://spinoff.nasa.gov/Spinoff2017/cg_1.html|publisher=NASA|accessdate=5 December 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Air-scrubbers===\nBased on a discovery made in the 1990s at the Wisconsin Center for Space Automation and Robotics where Researchers, with the help of the Space Product Development Program at Marshall Space Flight Center, were trying to find a way to eliminate ethylene that accumulates around plants growing in spacecraft and then found a solution: light-induced oxidation. When [[UV]] light hits titanium dioxide, it frees electrons that turn oxygen and moisture into charged particles that oxidize air contaminants such as volatile organic compounds, turning them into carbon dioxide and water. This air scrubber also eliminates other airborne organic compounds and neutralized bacteria, viruses, and molds. An air scrubber with light-induced oxidation can cleans air, surfaces and clothes and nearly 30 [[Major League Baseball]] teams now have this scrubber technology in their facilities.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://spinoff.nasa.gov/Spinoff2018/cg_2.html|title=Light-Induced Oxidation Cleans Air, Surfaces, Clothes |website=spinoff.nasa.gov|accessdate=March 12, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Bowflex===\nNASA noticed that astronauts came back to Earth with a lack of muscle mass and bone density in space because human bodies are used to being in gravity. Regular weight-lifting techniques and machines do not work well in space to help build muscle. Inventor Paul Francis, with funding from Johnson Space Center, designed a \"weightless weight trainer\" that uses elastic resistance. This trainer was launched to the space station in 2000, and a commercial version of the technology launched in 2005 as the [[Bowflex]], which quickly became popular in the gym market.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://spinoff.nasa.gov/Spinoff2019/cg_1.html|title=Bowflex System Spurs Revolution in Home Fitness| website=spinoff.nasa.gov|accessdate=July 19, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Environmental and agricultural resources==\n[[Image:Clean water Discovery 2006.jpg|thumbnail|right|upright|Water Security Corporation's Discovery Water Filtration System]]\n\n===Water purification===\nNASA engineers are collaborating with qualified companies to develop systems intended to sustain the astronauts living on the International Space Station and future Moon and space missions. This system turns wastewater from respiration, sweat, and urine into drinkable water.

The technology behind these solar devices\u2014which provide up to 50% more power than conventional solar cells\u2014originated with the efforts of a NASA-sponsored 28-member coalition forming the Environmental Research Aircraft and Sensor Technology (ERAST) Alliance. ERAST's goal was to develop remotely piloted aircraft, intended to fly unmanned at high altitudes for days at a time and requiring advanced solar power sources that did not add weight. As a result, SunPower Corporation created advanced silicon-based cells for terrestrial or airborne applications.<ref name=Spinoff2005 />{{rp|66\u201367}}\n\n===Pollution remediation===\nNASA's microencapsulating technology enabled the creation of a \"Petroleum Remediation Product,\" which safely cleans petroleum-based pollutants from water. The PRP uses thousands of microcapsules\u2014tiny balls of beeswax with hollow centers. Water cannot penetrate the microcapsule's cell, but oil is absorbed into the beeswax spheres as they float on the water's surface. Contaminating chemical compounds that originally come from crude oil (such as fuels, motor oils, or petroleum hydrocarbons) are caught before they settle, limiting damage to ocean beds.<ref name=Spinoff2006 /><ref name=Spinoff1994 />\n\n===Correcting for GPS signal errors===\nIn the 1990s, NASA scientists at JPL developed software capable of correcting for [[GPS]] signal errors, enabling accuracy within inches; it is called Real-Time GIPSY (RTG). [[John Deere]] licensed the software and used it to develop self-driving farm equipment. As of 2016, as nearly 70% of North American farmland is cultivated by self-driving tractors, which rely on RTG that was developed at NASA.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://spinoff.nasa.gov/Spinoff2017/ee_1.html|title=GPS Correction Technology Lets Tractors Drive Themselves |publisher=NASA|accessdate=5 December 2016}}</ref>\n\nAnother user of RTG is Comtech Telecommunications, which is a major provider of location-based services.

The system developed with this data, WATEX, uses about 80 percent of its data inputs from publicly available NASA information. This free information allowed RTI to develop the WATEX system to successfully locate water sources, such as in 2004 at refugee camps during the [[War in Darfur]].<ref>[http://www.spacefoundation.org/programs/space-technology-hall-fame/inducted-technologies/watex WATEX] Space Foundation, Retrieved 10 May 2017</ref>\n\n==Computer technology==\n\n===Structural analysis software===\nNASA [[software]] engineers have created thousands of computer programs over the decades equipped to design, test, and analyze stress, vibration, and acoustical properties of a broad assortment of aerospace parts and structures. The [[NASTRAN|NASA Structural Analysis Program]], or NASTRAN, is considered one of the most successful and widely used NASA software programs. It has been used to design everything from Cadillacs to roller coaster rides. Originally created for spacecraft design, it has been employed in a host of non-aerospace applications and is available to industry through NASA's Computer Software Management and Information Center (COSMIC). COSMIC maintains a library of computer programs from NASA and other government agencies and sells them at a fraction of the cost of developing a new program. NASA Structural Analysis Computer Software was inducted into the [[Space Foundation]] Space Technology Hall of Fame in 1988.<ref name=Spinoff1991 /><ref name=Spinoff1988 /><ref name=Spinoff1980>{{cite book\n | author = NASA \n | title = Spinoff\n | location = Washington, DC\n | publisher = U.S. Government Printing Office\n | date = 1980\n | url = http://www.sti.nasa.gov/tto/back_issues_archives/1980.pdf\n | isbn = }}</ref><ref name=Spinoff1986>*{{cite book\n | author = NASA\n | title = Spinoff\n | location = Washington, DC\n | publisher = U.S. Government Printing Office\n | date = 1986\n | url = http://www.sti.nasa.gov/tto/back_issues_archives/1986.pdf\n | isbn = }}</ref><ref name=Spinoff1990>*{{cite book\n | author = NASA:P\n | title = Spinoff\n | location = Washington, DC\n | publisher = U.S. Government Printing Office\n | date = 1990\n | url = http://www.sti.nasa.gov/tto/back_issues_archives/1990.pdf\n | isbn = }}</ref><ref name=Spinoff1998>{{cite book\n | author = NASA\n | title = Spinoff\n | location = Washington, DC\n | publisher = U.S. Government Printing Office\n | date = 1998\n | url=http://www.sti.nasa.gov/tto/spinoff1998/index.html\n | isbn = }}</ref>\n\n===Remotely controlled ovens===\nEmbedded Web Technology (EWT) software\u2014originally developed by NASA for use by astronauts operating experiments on the International Space Station\u2014lets a user monitor and/or control a device remotely over the Internet.

PS300 lowers friction, reduces emissions, and has been used by NASA in advanced aeropropulsion engines, refrigeration compressors, turbochargers, and hybrid electrical turbogenerators. ADMA Products has found widespread industrial applications for the material.<ref name=Spinoff2005 />\n\n===Improved mine safety===\nAn ultrasonic bolt elongation monitor developed by a NASA scientist for testing tension and high-pressure loads on bolts and fasteners has continued to evolve over the past three decades. Today, the same scientist and Luna Innovations are using a digital adaptation of this same device for non-destructive evaluation (NDE) of railroad ties, groundwater analysis, radiation, and as a medical testing device to assess levels of internal swelling and pressure for patients suffering from intracranial pressure and compartment syndrome, a painful condition that results when pressure within muscles builds to dangerous levels.<ref name=Spinoff2005 /><ref name=Spinoff1978 />\n\n===Food safety===\nFaced with the problem of how and what to feed an astronaut in a sealed capsule under weightless conditions while planning for human spaceflight, NASA enlisted the aid of The Pillsbury Company to address two principal concerns: eliminating crumbs of food that might contaminate the spacecraft's atmosphere and sensitive instruments, and assuring absolute absence of disease-producing bacteria and toxins. Pillsbury developed the [[Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points]] (HACCP) concept to address NASA's second concern. HACCP is designed to prevent food safety problems rather than to catch them after they have occurred. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has applied HACCP guidelines for the handling of seafood, juice, and dairy products.<ref name=Spinoff1991 />\n\n===Gold plating===\nFor space missions, gold is particularly useful because it is good at reflecting light, which will help to detect celestial objects from far away and gold does not oxidize so it will not tarnish, unlike most other metals. Due to both benefits, the [[James Webb Space Telescope]] uses a lot of gold for its mirrors. NASA partnered with Epner Technology, a Brooklyn-based business that has been gold-plating for generations to develop the technology to gold plate the telescope's parts.  This NASA technology transfer to Epner gave the company a reputation for durable gold coatings and the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] was having to replate [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] statues that had faded over time.  Epner has contracted with the Academy to gold plate all future Oscars while offering a lifetime guarantee to replate, for free, any faded Oscar; its gold plating has lasted for decades in space without fading.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://spinoff.nasa.gov/Spinoff2018/ip_4.html|title=Gold Coating Keeps Oscars Bright |website=spinoff.nasa.gov|accessdate=March 12, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Mistakenly attributed NASA spinoffs==\nThe following is a list of technologies sometimes mistakenly attributed directly to NASA.<ref name=\"spinfaq\" /> In many cases, NASA popularized technology or aided its development, due to its usefulness in space, which ultimately resulted in the technology's creation.\n\n* [[Barcodes]] - The barcode was invented in 1948. However, NASA developed a type of barcode label that could endure in space environments.\n* [[Cordless Power Drills#Cordless drills|Cordless power tools]] - The first cordless power tool was unveiled by [[Black & Decker]] in 1961. These were used by NASA and a number of spinoff products came out of those projects such as portable cordless vacuums.\n* [[Magnetic Resonance Imaging|Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)]], best known as a device for body scanning. NASA contractor [[JPL]] developed [[digital signal processing]], which has applications in medical imaging used by MRIs.

However, in the late 1960s, NASA partnered with a company to make a highly accurate quartz clock.\n* [[Smoke detectors]] - NASA's connection to the modern smoke detector is that it developed one with adjustable sensitivity as part of the [[Skylab]] project; this development helps with nuisance tripping. \n* [[Space Pen]] - An [[urban legend]] states that NASA spent a large amount of money to develop a pen that would write in space (the result purportedly being the Fisher Space Pen), while the Soviets used pencils. While NASA did spend funds to create a pen to work in space, the project was cancelled due to public opposition, and U.S. astronauts used pencils until the Fisher space pen was invented by a third party.<ref name=\"physics1\">{{cite web|title=Is it true that NASA spent thousands of dollars developing a space pen, whereas the Russians just took a pencil?|url=http://www.physics.org/facts/apollo-nasa-pen.asp|publisher=physics.org|accessdate=2 November 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"snopes1\">{{cite web|title=The Write Stuff|url=http://www.snopes.com/business/genius/spacepen.asp|accessdate=September 23, 2013}}</ref>) However, that the use of felt tipped pens, which do not rely on gravity or pressure, but capillary action, were popularized by NASA, a prominent product being the Flair brand pen, as well as felt markers.\n* [[Tang (drink)|Tang juice powder]] - Tang was developed by [[General Foods]] in 1957. Tang was used in multiple early space missions, which gave brand awareness to it.\n* [[Teflon]] - Teflon was invented by a [[DuPont]] scientist in 1941 and used on frying pans from the 1950s; however, it has been applied by NASA to [[heat shield]]s, [[space suit]]s, and cargo hold liners.<ref name=\"IntArcTeflon\">{{cite web|url=http://home.nycap.rr.com/useless/teflon/index.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080214150646/http://home.nycap.rr.com/useless/teflon/index.html|title=Teflon|archivedate=14 February 2008|publisher=}}</ref>  \n* [[Velcro]] - Velcro is a Swiss invention from the 1940s.

Since 1976, NASA has featured an average of 50 technologies each year in the annual publication, and ''Spinoff'' maintains a searchable database of these technologies. When products first spun off from space research, NASA presented a black and white report in 1973, titled the \"Technology Utilization Program Report\". Because of interest in the reports, NASA decided to create the annual publications in color. ''Spinoff'' was first published in 1976,<ref name=Spinoff1976 /> and since then, NASA has distributed free copies to universities, the media, inventors and the general public. ''Spinoff'' describes how NASA works with various industries and small businesses to bring new technology to the public. As of 2016, there were over 1,920 ''Spinoff'' products in the database dating back to 1976.<ref>{{cite web|last=NASA Spinoff Database|url=http://spinoff.nasa.gov/spinoff/database|publisher=National Aeronautics and Space Administration|title=NASA Spinoff Database|date=December 5, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Health and medicine==\n\n===Infrared ear thermometers===\nDiatek Corporation and NASA developed an [[Infrared thermometer|aural thermometer]] that measures the [[thermal radiation]] emitted by the [[eardrum]], similar to the way the temperature of stars and planets are measured.

This sensor changes color in response to contact with its target. After completing the work with NASA, IOS was tasked by the U.S. Department of Defense to further develop the sensors for detecting chemical warfare agents and potential threats, such as toxic industrial compounds and nerve agents. IOS has sold the chemically sensitive fiber optic cables to major automotive and aerospace companies, who are finding a variety of uses for the devices such as aiding experimentation with nontraditional power sources, and as an economical \"alarm system\" for detecting chemical release in large facilities.<ref name=Spinoff2007 />\n\n==Public safety==\n\n===Video enhancing and analysis systems===\nIntergraph Government Solutions developed its Video Analyst System (VAS) by building on Video Image Stabilization and Registration (VISAR) technology created by NASA to help FBI agents analyze video footage.

Aside from law enforcement and security applications, VAS has also been adapted to serve the military for reconnaissance, weapons deployment, damage assessment, training, and mission debriefing.<ref name=Spinoff2001>{{cite book\n | author = NASA\n | title = Spinoff\n | location = Washington, DC\n | publisher = U.S. Government Printing Office\n | date = 2001\n | url=http://www.sti.nasa.gov/tto/spinoff2001/index.html\n | isbn = }}</ref>\n\n===Landmine removal===\n[[Thiokol]] has used surplus rocket fuel through an agreement with NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center to produce a flare that can safely destroy landmines. The fuel that is left unused from a launch will become a solid, which cannot be reused but can be used as an ingredient needed to create the Demining Device flare. The Demining Device flare uses a battery-triggered electric match to ignite and neutralize land mines in the field without detonation. The flare uses the solid rocket fuel to burn a hole in a mine's case and burns away the explosive contents so the mine can be disarmed without hazard.<ref name=Spinoff2000/>\n\n===Fire-resistant reinforcement===\nBuilt and designed by Avco Corporation, the Apollo heat shield was coated with a material whose purpose was to burn and thus dissipate energy during reentry while charring, to form a protective coating to block heat penetration. NASA subsequently funded Avco's development of other applications of the heat shield, such as fire-retardant paints and foams for aircraft, which led to an intumescent epoxy material, which expands in volume when exposed to heat or flames, acting as an insulating barrier and dissipating heat through burn-off. Further innovations include steel coatings devised to make high-rise buildings and public structures safer by swelling to provide a tough and stable insulating layer over the steel for up to 4 hours of fire protection, ultimately to slow building collapse and provide more time for escape.<ref name=Spinoff2006>{{cite book\n | author = NASA\n | title = Spinoff\n | location = Washington, DC\n | publisher = U.S. Government Printing Office\n | date = 2006\n | url=http://www.sti.nasa.gov/tto/Spinoff2006/index.html\n | isbn = }}</ref>\n\n===Firefighting equipment===\nFirefighting equipment in the United States is based on lightweight materials developed for the U.S. Space Program. NASA and the National Bureau of Standards created a lightweight breathing system including face mask, frame, harness, and air bottle, using an aluminum composite material developed by NASA for use on rocket casings. The broadest fire-related technology transfer is the breathing apparatus for protection from smoke inhalation injury.\n\nAdditionally, NASA's inductorless electronic circuit technology led to lower-cost, more rugged, short-range two-way radio now used by firefighters. NASA also helped develop a specialized mask weighing less than {{convert|3|oz}} to protect the physically impaired from injuries to the face and head, as well as flexible, heat-resistant materials\u2014developed to protect the space shuttle on reentry\u2014which are being used both by the military and commercially in suits for municipal and aircraft-rescue firefighters.<ref name=Spinoff1978>{{cite book\n | author = NASA\n | title = Spin-off\n | location = Washington, DC\n | publisher = U.S. Government Printing Office\n | date = 1978\n | url = http://www.sti.nasa.gov/tto/back_issues_archives/1978.pdf\n | isbn = }}</ref><ref name=Spinoff1981>{{cite book\n | author = NASA\n | title = Spin-off\n | location = Washington, DC\n | publisher = U.S. Government Printing Office\n | date = 1981\n | url = http://www.sti.nasa.gov/tto/back_issues_archives/1981.pdf\n | isbn = }}</ref><ref name=Spinoff1982>{{cite book\n | author = NASA\n | title = Spin-off\n | location = Washington, DC\n | publisher = U.S. Government Printing Office\n | date = 1982\n | url = http://www.sti.nasa.gov/tto/back_issues_archives/1982.pdf\n | isbn = }}</ref><ref name=Spinoff2000>{{cite book\n | author = NASA\n | title = Spin-off\n | location = Washington, DC\n | publisher = U.S. Government Printing Office\n | date = 2000\n | url=http://www.sti.nasa.gov/tto/spinoff2000/index.htm\n | isbn = }}</ref>\n\n===Shock absorbers for buildings===\nWith NASA funding, Taylor Devices Inc. developed shock absorbers that could safely remove the fuel and electrical connectors from the Space Shuttles during launch.

The substance, formulated into the products life'sDHA and life'sARA and based on microalgae, can be found in over 90% of the infant formulas sold in the United States, and are added to infant formulas in over 65 other countries. Martek Biosciences Corporation's founders and principal scientists acquired their expertise in this area while working on the NASA program.

[[Black & Decker]] was tasked with the job, and developed a computer program to optimize the design of the drill's motor and ensure minimal power consumption. That computer program led to the development of a cordless miniature vacuum cleaner called the DustBuster.<ref name=Spinoff1981 />\n\n===Freeze drying===\nIn planning for the long-duration Apollo missions, NASA conducted extensive research into space food. One of the techniques developed in 1938 by Nestl\u00e9 was [[freeze drying]]. In the United States, Action Products later commercialized this technique for other foods, concentrating on snack food resulting in products like [[Space ice cream]]. The foods are cooked, quickly frozen, and then slowly heated in a vacuum chamber to remove the ice crystals formed by the freezing process. The final product retains 98% {{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} of its nutrition and weighs much less than before drying.  The ratio of weight before and after drying depends strongly on the particular food item but a typical freeze-dried weight is 20% of the original weight.\n\nToday, one of the benefits of this advancement in food preservation includes simple, nutritious meals available to disabled and otherwise homebound senior adults unable to take advantage of existing meal programs.<ref name=Spinoff1978 /><ref name=Spinoff1980 /><ref name=Spinoff1994>{{cite book\n | author = NASA\n | title = Spinoff\n | location = Washington, DC\n | publisher = U.S. Government Printing Office\n | date = 1994\n | url = http://www.sti.nasa.gov/tto/back_issues_archives/1994.pdf\n | isbn = }}</ref>\n\n===Space age swimsuit===\nLangley Research Center's wind tunnel testing facilities and fluid flow analysis software supported [[Speedo]]'s design of a space age-enriched swimsuit.

In March 2008, athletes wearing the LZR Racer broke 13 swimming world records.<ref>[https://spinoff.nasa.gov/spinoff/database/spinoffDetail.php?this=/spinoff//larc/LARC-SO-212 NASA Spinoff Database: Space Age Swimsuit Reduces Drag, Breaks Records] NASA, Retrieved 6 December 2016</ref>\n\n===CMOS image sensor===\nThe invention of [[CMOS image sensor]]s used in products such as [[mobile phones]] and [[GoPro]] [[action camera]]s traces back to NASA JPL scientist [[Eric Fossum]] who wanted to miniaturize cameras for interplanetary missions. Fossum invented [[CMOS]] image sensors that have become NASA's most ubiquitous spinoff technology, enabling the use of [[digital cameras]] in mobile phones ([[camera phones]]). Fossum found a way to reduce the signal noise that had plagued earlier attempts at CMOS imagers, applying a technique called intra-pixel charge transfer with correlated double sampling that results in a clearer image. This led to the creation of CMOS [[active pixel sensor]]s, which are used today in all [[smartphone]] cameras and many other applications.<ref>{{cite web|title=CMOS Sensors Enable Phone Cameras, HD Video|url=https://spinoff.nasa.gov/Spinoff2017/cg_1.html|publisher=NASA|accessdate=5 December 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Air-scrubbers===\nBased on a discovery made in the 1990s at the Wisconsin Center for Space Automation and Robotics where Researchers, with the help of the Space Product Development Program at Marshall Space Flight Center, were trying to find a way to eliminate ethylene that accumulates around plants growing in spacecraft and then found a solution: light-induced oxidation. When [[UV]] light hits titanium dioxide, it frees electrons that turn oxygen and moisture into charged particles that oxidize air contaminants such as volatile organic compounds, turning them into carbon dioxide and water. This air scrubber also eliminates other airborne organic compounds and neutralized bacteria, viruses, and molds. An air scrubber with light-induced oxidation can cleans air, surfaces and clothes and nearly 30 [[Major League Baseball]] teams now have this scrubber technology in their facilities.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://spinoff.nasa.gov/Spinoff2018/cg_2.html|title=Light-Induced Oxidation Cleans Air, Surfaces, Clothes |website=spinoff.nasa.gov|accessdate=March 12, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Bowflex===\nNASA noticed that astronauts came back to Earth with a lack of muscle mass and bone density in space because human bodies are used to being in gravity. Regular weight-lifting techniques and machines do not work well in space to help build muscle. Inventor Paul Francis, with funding from Johnson Space Center, designed a \"weightless weight trainer\" that uses elastic resistance. This trainer was launched to the space station in 2000, and a commercial version of the technology launched in 2005 as the [[Bowflex]], which quickly became popular in the gym market.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://spinoff.nasa.gov/Spinoff2019/cg_1.html|title=Bowflex System Spurs Revolution in Home Fitness| website=spinoff.nasa.gov|accessdate=July 19, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Environmental and agricultural resources==\n[[Image:Clean water Discovery 2006.jpg|thumbnail|right|upright|Water Security Corporation's Discovery Water Filtration System]]\n\n===Water purification===\nNASA engineers are collaborating with qualified companies to develop systems intended to sustain the astronauts living on the International Space Station and future Moon and space missions. This system turns wastewater from respiration, sweat, and urine into drinkable water.

The technology behind these solar devices\u2014which provide up to 50% more power than conventional solar cells\u2014originated with the efforts of a NASA-sponsored 28-member coalition forming the Environmental Research Aircraft and Sensor Technology (ERAST) Alliance. ERAST's goal was to develop remotely piloted aircraft, intended to fly unmanned at high altitudes for days at a time and requiring advanced solar power sources that did not add weight. As a result, SunPower Corporation created advanced silicon-based cells for terrestrial or airborne applications.<ref name=Spinoff2005 />{{rp|66\u201367}}\n\n===Pollution remediation===\nNASA's microencapsulating technology enabled the creation of a \"Petroleum Remediation Product,\" which safely cleans petroleum-based pollutants from water. The PRP uses thousands of microcapsules\u2014tiny balls of beeswax with hollow centers. Water cannot penetrate the microcapsule's cell, but oil is absorbed into the beeswax spheres as they float on the water's surface. Contaminating chemical compounds that originally come from crude oil (such as fuels, motor oils, or petroleum hydrocarbons) are caught before they settle, limiting damage to ocean beds.<ref name=Spinoff2006 /><ref name=Spinoff1994 />\n\n===Correcting for GPS signal errors===\nIn the 1990s, NASA scientists at JPL developed software capable of correcting for [[GPS]] signal errors, enabling accuracy within inches; it is called Real-Time GIPSY (RTG). [[John Deere]] licensed the software and used it to develop self-driving farm equipment. As of 2016, as nearly 70% of North American farmland is cultivated by self-driving tractors, which rely on RTG that was developed at NASA.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://spinoff.nasa.gov/Spinoff2017/ee_1.html|title=GPS Correction Technology Lets Tractors Drive Themselves |publisher=NASA|accessdate=5 December 2016}}</ref>\n\nAnother user of RTG is Comtech Telecommunications, which is a major provider of location-based services.

The system developed with this data, WATEX, uses about 80 percent of its data inputs from publicly available NASA information. This free information allowed RTI to develop the WATEX system to successfully locate water sources, such as in 2004 at refugee camps during the [[War in Darfur]].<ref>[http://www.spacefoundation.org/programs/space-technology-hall-fame/inducted-technologies/watex WATEX] Space Foundation, Retrieved 10 May 2017</ref>\n\n==Computer technology==\n\n===Structural analysis software===\nNASA [[software]] engineers have created thousands of computer programs over the decades equipped to design, test, and analyze stress, vibration, and acoustical properties of a broad assortment of aerospace parts and structures. The [[NASTRAN|NASA Structural Analysis Program]], or NASTRAN, is considered one of the most successful and widely used NASA software programs. It has been used to design everything from Cadillacs to roller coaster rides. Originally created for spacecraft design, it has been employed in a host of non-aerospace applications and is available to industry through NASA's Computer Software Management and Information Center (COSMIC). COSMIC maintains a library of computer programs from NASA and other government agencies and sells them at a fraction of the cost of developing a new program.

ADMA Products has found widespread industrial applications for the material.<ref name=Spinoff2005 />\n\n===Improved mine safety===\nAn ultrasonic bolt elongation monitor developed by a NASA scientist for testing tension and high-pressure loads on bolts and fasteners has continued to evolve over the past three decades. Today, the same scientist and Luna Innovations are using a digital adaptation of this same device for non-destructive evaluation (NDE) of railroad ties, groundwater analysis, radiation, and as a medical testing device to assess levels of internal swelling and pressure for patients suffering from intracranial pressure and compartment syndrome, a painful condition that results when pressure within muscles builds to dangerous levels.<ref name=Spinoff2005 /><ref name=Spinoff1978 />\n\n===Food safety===\nFaced with the problem of how and what to feed an astronaut in a sealed capsule under weightless conditions while planning for human spaceflight, NASA enlisted the aid of The Pillsbury Company to address two principal concerns: eliminating crumbs of food that might contaminate the spacecraft's atmosphere and sensitive instruments, and assuring absolute absence of disease-producing bacteria and toxins. Pillsbury developed the [[Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points]] (HACCP) concept to address NASA's second concern. HACCP is designed to prevent food safety problems rather than to catch them after they have occurred. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has applied HACCP guidelines for the handling of seafood, juice, and dairy products.<ref name=Spinoff1991 />\n\n===Gold plating===\nFor space missions, gold is particularly useful because it is good at reflecting light, which will help to detect celestial objects from far away and gold does not oxidize so it will not tarnish, unlike most other metals. Due to both benefits, the [[James Webb Space Telescope]] uses a lot of gold for its mirrors. NASA partnered with Epner Technology, a Brooklyn-based business that has been gold-plating for generations to develop the technology to gold plate the telescope's parts.  This NASA technology transfer to Epner gave the company a reputation for durable gold coatings and the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] was having to replate [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] statues that had faded over time.  Epner has contracted with the Academy to gold plate all future Oscars while offering a lifetime guarantee to replate, for free, any faded Oscar; its gold plating has lasted for decades in space without fading.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://spinoff.nasa.gov/Spinoff2018/ip_4.html|title=Gold Coating Keeps Oscars Bright |website=spinoff.nasa.gov|accessdate=March 12, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Mistakenly attributed NASA spinoffs==\nThe following is a list of technologies sometimes mistakenly attributed directly to NASA.<ref name=\"spinfaq\" /> In many cases, NASA popularized technology or aided its development, due to its usefulness in space, which ultimately resulted in the technology's creation.\n\n* [[Barcodes]] - The barcode was invented in 1948.

[[NATO]] adapted the design for the NATO IVA and IVB communication satellites, also manufactured by BAe Dynamics.\nThe programme timescales were delayed, as initially Skynet 4 was designed to be launched from the Space Shuttle (STS), with chosen RAF officers to be part of each Shuttle Crew. However following the 1986 Challenger disaster (STS 51-L), the programme slowed and all the Skynet 4s had to be modified to suit the changes needed to go on a disposable launch vehicle. As Skynet 4A's build was advanced it needed significant modification, and its completion was overtaken by 4B which had not progressed as far, and hence more easily converted. Consequently, 4B was finished first and launched in 1988, with 4A next in early 1990, and 4C later the same year.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraft/display.action?id=1990-001A | title=NASA - NSSDCA - Spacecraft - Details}}</ref><ref>[https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraft/display.action?id=1990-079A NASA Space Science Data Coordinated Archive]</ref>\n\nThe improved Stage 2 satellites (4D, 4E and 4F) were built by [[Matra Marconi Space]] and [[Astrium]] to replace the earlier versions.

[[NATO]] adapted the design for the NATO IVA and IVB communication satellites, also manufactured by BAe Dynamics.\nThe programme timescales were delayed, as initially Skynet 4 was designed to be launched from the Space Shuttle (STS), with chosen RAF officers to be part of each Shuttle Crew. However following the 1986 Challenger disaster (STS 51-L), the programme slowed and all the Skynet 4s had to be modified to suit the changes needed to go on a disposable launch vehicle. As Skynet 4A's build was advanced it needed significant modification, and its completion was overtaken by 4B which had not progressed as far, and hence more easily converted. Consequently, 4B was finished first and launched in 1988, with 4A next in early 1990, and 4C later the same year.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraft/display.action?id=1990-001A | title=NASA - NSSDCA - Spacecraft - Details}}</ref><ref>[https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraft/display.action?id=1990-079A NASA Space Science Data Coordinated Archive]</ref>\n\nThe improved Stage 2 satellites (4D, 4E and 4F) were built by [[Matra Marconi Space]] and [[Astrium]] to replace the earlier versions.

Its regiments were nominally the 1st Brigade of MGEN [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] 4th Division of [[George Henry Thomas|Thomas']] [[XIV Corps (Union Army)|XIV Corps]]. Operationally, they were detached from the division and serving as a mobile mounted infantry to support any of the army's corps. Col [[John T. Wilder]] was its commander. As initially organized. the brigade had the following regiments:|<ref>{{Baumgartner, Richard A. (2007). Blue Lightning: Wilder's Mounted Brigade in the Battle of Chickamauga.

Miller\n* [[18th Independent Battery Indiana Light Artillery]]\n[[File:John T Wilder monument Chickamauga.jpg|thumb|Monument to Wilder and his Lightning Brigade at [[Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park]]]]\n\n\n==Formation==\nIn response to [[John Hunt Morgan]]\u2019s October 1862 raid, the brigade was sent by Major General [[William Rosecrans|William S. Rosecrans]] in pursuit. In an effort move faster, the brigade mounted in mule wagons. The brigade nearly caught Morgan, but when they entered the last rebel bivouac, Morgan had escaped. In this effort, John T. Wilder served as the commander of the 17th Indiana, one of the component regiments in the brigade.\n\nOn 22 December, 1862 in Gallatin, Tennessee, John T. Wilder took over command of the brigade which at that time consisted of the 92nd and 98th Illinois Infantry Regiments, the 17th, 72nd, and [[75th Indiana Infantry]] Regiments, and the 18th Indiana Battery of Light Artillery. His intial combat mission was to pursue another of Morgan\u2019s raids into Kentucky intended to sever the Army of the Cumberland's primary supply line. Lacking sufficient cavlary to screen his army as he moved south toward what would be the [[Second Battle of Murfreesboro|Battle of Stones River]] as part of the [[Stones River Campaign]], Rosecrans again had to use infantry to chase off Morgan. Trying to speed their movement, these infantry units deployed partially by rail. Wilder also unsuccessfully tried to replicate the use of mule-drawn wagons with the addition of men mounting the mules pulling the wagons<ref>[https://www.oocities.org/wildersbrigade/history.html</ref>. Unfortunately, they still traveled the majority of the pursuit on foot over unimproved, that is unpaved, roads. Despite the use of rail and wagons to speed up the pursuit, the mission was a failure with Morgan's command escaping at the the Rolling Fork River.<ref>The History of Morgan\u2019s Cavalry, Basil W. Duke, Indiana University Press</ref><ref>John Hunt Morgan and his Raiders, Edison H. Thomas, University of KY Press</ref>The difference in speed between cavalry and infantry was too much from the start.\n\nAs a result of the failure, Rosecrans and his subordinates revisited the experiment with wagons from the October events and realized the solution to their problems was the early role of dragoons as mounted infantrymen. Several times, Rosecrans wrot to the Union General-in-Chief Major General [[Henry Wager Halleck]] stating his intention to convert/establish units of mounted infantry. He also felt that he needed to outfit all of his cavalry with repeating weapons. When he felt he was not being heard, he went over Halleck directly to War Secretary Edward M Stanton. In a dispatch from 2 February, he explained his reasons to Scretary Stanton:\n{{Quote\n|text=I telegraphed the General-in-Chief that 2,000 carbines or revolving rifles were required to arm our cavalry.\nHe replied as though he thought it a complaint.\nOne rebel cavalryman takes on an average three of our infantry to watch our communications, while our progress is made slow and cautious, and we command the forage of the country only be sending large train guards.\nIt is of prime necessity, in every point of view, to master their cavalry.  I propose to do this, first, by so arming our cavalry as to give it its maximum strength.  Second, by having animals and saddles temporarily to mount infantry brigades for marches and enterprises.<ref>[https://www.oocities.org/wildersbrigade/history.html</ref>\n}}\n\nWilder, an innovative and creatuve man, was an eager advocate to Rosecrans for mounted infantry as a solution. On 12 February 1863, Rosecrans ordered Wilder to find mounts for his brigade. The regiments also voted on whether to convert to mounted infantry.  All but the 75th Indiana voted to change to mounted infantry. The 123rd Illinois who had wanted to become mounted infantry transferred from the 1st Brigade of the 5th Division of XIV Corps to replace them. Through February 1863, Wilder he obtained around a thousand mules to mount his command. Due to the obstinacy of the mules, horses were frequently seized from local stocks in Tennessee as contraband and replaced the mules.\n\nFrom the outset, the brigade used their mounts to travel rapidly to contact, but once engaged with the enemy, the soldiers fought dismounted. It was due to this speed of deployment that the unit earned the nickname, \u201cThe Lightning Brigade,\u201d and it would prove the validity of its conversion in the campaign in the Western theater. They were also sometimes known as the \"Hatchet Brigade\" because they received long-handled [[hatchet]]s to carry instead of [[cavalry]] [[Sabre|saber]]s.\n\nAs well as mounting the command for faster deployment, Wilder felt that muzzle-loaded rifles were too difficult to use traveling on horseback. Like Rosecrans, he also believed that the superiority of repeating rifles were worth their price in return for the great increase in firepower. The repeating rifles also had the standoff range similar to the standard infantry [[Lorenz rifle|Lorenzes]], [[Springfield Model 1861|Springfields,]] and [[Pattern 1853 Enfield|Enfields]] in use by the Army of the Cumberland. He felt the repeating and breechloading carbines in use by the Federal cavalry that lacked the accuracy at long range that his brigade would need. \n\nWhile Rosecrans looked at the the regiment's five-shot [[Colt revolving rifle]] that would equip other units in the Army of the Cumberland (particularly seeing action with the [[21st Ohio Infantry|21st Ohio Volunteer Infantry]] Union forces at [[Snodgrass Hill]] during the [[Battle of Chickamauga]]), Wilder was initially opting for the [[Henry rifle|Henry]] repeating rifle as the proper weapon to arm his brigade. In early March, Wilder arranged a proposal for [[New Haven Arms Company]] (which later became famous as Winchester Repeating Arms) to supply his brigade with the sixteen-shot Henry if the soldiers paid for the weapons out of pocket. He had received backing from banks in Indiana on loans to be signed by each soldier and cosigned by Wilder. New Haven could come agreement with Wilder despite the financing.<ref>https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/25/colonel-wilders-lightning-brigade/</ref>,ref>https://www.historynet.com/battle-of-chickamauga-colonel-john-wilders-lightning-brigade-prevented-total-disaster.htm</ref>\n\nAfter attending a promotional demonstration by [[Christopher Spencer]] for the Army of the Cumberland of his [[Spencer repeating rifle]]<ref>[http://www.civilwar.si.edu/weapons_spencer.html A Spencer at the Smithsonian Institution]</ref>, Wilder proposed the Henry arangement to Spencer. Spencer agreed and got the Ordnance Department to send a shipment to the Army of the Cumberland. Embarrassed, the Government paid for the weapons before the men expended any of their personal money.<ref>Cozzens, p. 15; Korn, p. 21.</ref>The majority of the shipment armed all men of the brigade.\n\nThe brigade\u2019s new weapon had a tubular magazine that held seven rimfire cartridges and, it would soon prove to be one of the most deadly weapons in the Civil War. With new mounts and new weapons, the brigade worked out new tactics. Wilder and other mounted infantry units in the Army of the Cumberland developed new methods. \n\n==Baptism of Fire==\n{{main|Battle of Hoover's Gap}}\nOn June 23, 1863, Rosecrans deployed forces to feign an attack on [[Shelbyville, Tennessee|Shelbyville]] while massing forces against Bragg's right. His troops struck out toward Liberty, Hoover's, and Bellbuckle Gaps through the [[Highland Rim]] (near [[Beechgrove, Coffee County, Tennessee|Beechgrove, Tennessee]]). On June 24, Maj. Gen. [[George Henry Thomas|George H. Thomas's]] men, spearheaded by Colonel [[John T. Wilder]]'s \"Lightning Brigade\", made for [[Battle of Hoover's Gap|Hoover's Gap]].

Its regiments were nominally the 1st Brigade of MGEN [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] 4th Division of [[George Henry Thomas|Thomas']] [[XIV Corps (Union Army)|XIV Corps]]. Operationally, they were detached from the division and serving as a mobile mounted infantry to support any of the army's corps. Col [[John T. Wilder]] was its commander. As initially organized. the brigade had the following regiments:|<ref>{{Baumgartner, Richard A. (2007). Blue Lightning: Wilder's Mounted Brigade in the Battle of Chickamauga.

Miller\n* [[18th Independent Battery Indiana Light Artillery]]\n[[File:John T Wilder monument Chickamauga.jpg|thumb|Monument to Wilder and his Lightning Brigade at [[Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park]]]]\n\n\n==Formation==\nIn response to [[John Hunt Morgan]]\u2019s October 1862 raid, the brigade was sent by Major General [[William Rosecrans|William S. Rosecrans]] in pursuit. In an effort move faster, the brigade mounted in mule wagons. The brigade nearly caught Morgan, but when they entered the last rebel bivouac, Morgan had escaped. In this effort, John T. Wilder served as the commander of the 17th Indiana, one of the component regiments in the brigade.\n\nOn 22 December, 1862 in Gallatin, Tennessee, John T. Wilder took over command of the brigade which at that time consisted of the 92nd and 98th Illinois Infantry Regiments, the 17th, 72nd, and [[75th Indiana Infantry]] Regiments, and the 18th Indiana Battery of Light Artillery. His intial combat mission was to pursue another of Morgan\u2019s raids into Kentucky intended to sever the Army of the Cumberland's primary supply line. Lacking sufficient cavlary to screen his army as he moved south toward what would be the [[Second Battle of Murfreesboro|Battle of Stones River]] as part of the [[Stones River Campaign]], Rosecrans again had to use infantry to chase off Morgan. Trying to speed their movement, these infantry units deployed partially by rail. Wilder also unsuccessfully tried to replicate the use of mule-drawn wagons with the addition of men mounting the mules pulling the wagons<ref>[https://www.oocities.org/wildersbrigade/history.html</ref>. Unfortunately, they still traveled the majority of the pursuit on foot over unimproved, that is unpaved, roads. Despite the use of rail and wagons to speed up the pursuit, the mission was a failure with Morgan's command escaping at the the Rolling Fork River.<ref>The History of Morgan\u2019s Cavalry, Basil W. Duke, Indiana University Press</ref><ref>John Hunt Morgan and his Raiders, Edison H. Thomas, University of KY Press</ref>The difference in speed between cavalry and infantry was too much from the start.\n\nAs a result of the failure, Rosecrans and his subordinates revisited the experiment with wagons from the October events and realized the solution to their problems was the early role of dragoons as mounted infantrymen. Several times, Rosecrans wrot to the Union General-in-Chief Major General [[Henry Wager Halleck]] stating his intention to convert/establish units of mounted infantry. He also felt that he needed to outfit all of his cavalry with repeating weapons. When he felt he was not being heard, he went over Halleck directly to War Secretary Edward M Stanton. In a dispatch from 2 February, he explained his reasons to Scretary Stanton:\n{{Quote\n|text=I telegraphed the General-in-Chief that 2,000 carbines or revolving rifles were required to arm our cavalry.\nHe replied as though he thought it a complaint.\nOne rebel cavalryman takes on an average three of our infantry to watch our communications, while our progress is made slow and cautious, and we command the forage of the country only be sending large train guards.\nIt is of prime necessity, in every point of view, to master their cavalry.  I propose to do this, first, by so arming our cavalry as to give it its maximum strength.  Second, by having animals and saddles temporarily to mount infantry brigades for marches and enterprises.<ref>[https://www.oocities.org/wildersbrigade/history.html</ref>\n}}\n\nWilder, an innovative and creatuve man, was an eager advocate to Rosecrans for mounted infantry as a solution. On 12 February 1863, Rosecrans ordered Wilder to find mounts for his brigade. The regiments also voted on whether to convert to mounted infantry.  All but the 75th Indiana voted to change to mounted infantry. The 123rd Illinois who had wanted to become mounted infantry transferred from the 1st Brigade of the 5th Division of XIV Corps to replace them. Through February 1863, Wilder he obtained around a thousand mules to mount his command. Due to the obstinacy of the mules, horses were frequently seized from local stocks in Tennessee as contraband and replaced the mules.\n\nFrom the outset, the brigade used their mounts to travel rapidly to contact, but once engaged with the enemy, the soldiers fought dismounted. It was due to this speed of deployment that the unit earned the nickname, \u201cThe Lightning Brigade,\u201d and it would prove the validity of its conversion in the campaign in the Western theater. They were also sometimes known as the \"Hatchet Brigade\" because they received long-handled [[hatchet]]s to carry instead of [[cavalry]] [[Sabre|saber]]s.\n\nAs well as mounting the command for faster deployment, Wilder felt that muzzle-loaded rifles were too difficult to use traveling on horseback. Like Rosecrans, he also believed that the superiority of repeating rifles were worth their price in return for the great increase in firepower. The repeating rifles also had the standoff range similar to the standard infantry [[Lorenz rifle|Lorenzes]], [[Springfield Model 1861|Springfields,]] and [[Pattern 1853 Enfield|Enfields]] in use by the Army of the Cumberland. He felt the repeating and breechloading carbines in use by the Federal cavalry that lacked the accuracy at long range that his brigade would need. \n\nWhile Rosecrans looked at the the regiment's five-shot [[Colt revolving rifle]] that would equip other units in the Army of the Cumberland (particularly seeing action with the [[21st Ohio Infantry|21st Ohio Volunteer Infantry]] Union forces at [[Snodgrass Hill]] during the [[Battle of Chickamauga]]), Wilder was initially opting for the [[Henry rifle|Henry]] repeating rifle as the proper weapon to arm his brigade. In early March, Wilder arranged a proposal for [[New Haven Arms Company]] (which later became famous as Winchester Repeating Arms) to supply his brigade with the sixteen-shot Henry if the soldiers paid for the weapons out of pocket. He had received backing from banks in Indiana on loans to be signed by each soldier and cosigned by Wilder. New Haven could come agreement with Wilder despite the financing.<ref>https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/25/colonel-wilders-lightning-brigade/</ref>,ref>https://www.historynet.com/battle-of-chickamauga-colonel-john-wilders-lightning-brigade-prevented-total-disaster.htm</ref>\n\nAfter attending a promotional demonstration by [[Christopher Spencer]] for the Army of the Cumberland of his [[Spencer repeating rifle]]<ref>[http://www.civilwar.si.edu/weapons_spencer.html A Spencer at the Smithsonian Institution]</ref>, Wilder proposed the Henry arangement to Spencer. Spencer agreed and got the Ordnance Department to send a shipment to the Army of the Cumberland. Embarrassed, the Government paid for the weapons before the men expended any of their personal money.<ref>Cozzens, p. 15; Korn, p. 21.</ref>The majority of the shipment armed all men of the brigade.\n\nThe brigade\u2019s new weapon had a tubular magazine that held seven rimfire cartridges and, it would soon prove to be one of the most deadly weapons in the Civil War. With new mounts and new weapons, the brigade worked out new tactics. Wilder and other mounted infantry units in the Army of the Cumberland developed new methods. \n\n==Baptism of Fire==\n{{main|Battle of Hoover's Gap}}\nOn June 23, 1863, Rosecrans deployed forces to feign an attack on [[Shelbyville, Tennessee|Shelbyville]] while massing forces against Bragg's right. His troops struck out toward Liberty, Hoover's, and Bellbuckle Gaps through the [[Highland Rim]] (near [[Beechgrove, Coffee County, Tennessee|Beechgrove, Tennessee]]). On June 24, Maj. Gen. [[George Henry Thomas|George H. Thomas's]] men, spearheaded by Colonel [[John T. Wilder]]'s \"Lightning Brigade\", made for [[Battle of Hoover's Gap|Hoover's Gap]]. The brigade showed their velocity of movement by reaching the gap nearly 9 miles ahead of Thomas's main body.<ref name=\"Kennedy225\">Kennedy, p. 225.</ref> Despite orders from the divisional commander, General [[Joseph J.
