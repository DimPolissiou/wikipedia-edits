This is followed by an account of Khosrow's feast in a farmer's house; for which Khosrow is severely chastised by his father. Khosrow asks forgiveness and repents his offence. [[Hormizd IV]], who is now pleased with his son, forgives him. That very night, Khosrow sees his grandfather [[Khosrau I|Anushirvan]] in a dream and Anushirvan gives him glad tidings of a wife named [[Shirin]], a steed named [[Shabdiz]], a musician named [[Barbad]], and a great kingdom, that is [[Persia]].\n\nShapur, Khosrow's close friend and a painter, tells Khosrow of the [[Armenians|Armenian]] queen [[Mahin Banu]] and her niece Shirin. Hearing Shapur's descriptions of Shirin's flawless features, the young prince falls in love with Shirin, the Armenian princess. Shapur travels to [[Persian Armenia|Armenia]] to look for Shirin. Shapur finds Shirin and shows the image of Khosrow to Shirin. Shirin falls in love with Khosrow and escapes from Armenia to Khosrow's capital [[Mada'in]]; but meanwhile, Khosrow also flees from his father's anger and sets out for Armenia in search of Shirin.\n\nOn the way, he finds Shirin unclothed bathing and washing her flowing hair; Shirin also sees him; but since Khosrow was traveling in peasant clothes, they do not recognize one another. Khosrow arrives in Armenia and is welcomed by [[Shamira]] the queen of Armenia - yet he finds out that Shirin is in Mada'in. Again, Shapur is sent to bring Shirin. When Shirin reaches Armenia, Khosrow&nbsp;\u2013 because of his father's death - has to return to Mada'in. The two lovers keep going to opposite places until Khosrow is overthrown by a general named [[Bahr\u0101m Chobin]] and flees to Armenia.\n\nIn Armenia, Khosrow finally meets Shirin and is welcomed by her. Shirin, however, does not agree to marry Khosrow; unless Khosrow first claims his country back from Bahram Chobin. Thus, Khosrow leaves Shirin in Armenia and goes to [[Constantinople]]. The Caesar agrees to assist him against Bahram Chobin on condition that he marry his daughter Mariam. Khosrow is also forced to promise not to marry any one else long as Mariam is alive. Khosrow succeeds in defeating his enemy and reclaims his throne. Mariam, out of jealousy, keeps Khosrow away from Shirin.\n\nMeanwhile, a sculptor named [[Farhad (Persian literature)|Farhad]] falls in love with Shirin and becomes Khosrow's love-rival. Khosrow cannot abide Farhad, so he sends him as an exile to [[Behistun]] mountain with the impossible task of carving stairs out of the cliff rocks. Farhad begins his task hoping that Khosrow will allow him to marry Shirin. Yet, Khosrow sends a messenger to Farhad and gives him false news of Shirin's death. Hearing this false news, Farhad throws himself from the mountaintop and dies. Khosrow writes a letter to Shirin, expressing his regret for Farhad's death. Soon after this incident, Mariam also dies. According to [[Ferdowsi]]'s version, it was Shirin who secretly poisoned Mariam. Shirin replies to Khosrow's letter with another satirical letter of condolences.\n\nKhosrow, before proposing marriage to Shirin, tries to have intimacy with another woman named Shekar in [[Isfahan]], which further delays the lovers' union. Finally, Khosrow goes to Shirin's castle to see her. Shirin, seeing that Khosrow is drunk, does not let him in the castle. She particularly reproaches Khosrow for his intimacy with Shekar. Khosrow, sad and rejected, returns to his palace.\n\nShirin eventually consents to marry Khosrow after several romantic and heroic episodes. Yet, [[Kavadh II|Shiroyeh]], Khosrow's son from his wife Mariam, is also in love with Shirin. Shiroyeh finally murders his father Khosrow and sends a messenger to Shirin conveying that after one week, she would have to marry him. Shirin, in order to avoid marrying Shiroy, kills herself. Khosrow and Shirin were buried together in the same grave.\n\n==Popularity in Persian literature==\n[[File:Khosrow and Shirin-page0085.jpeg|thumb|right|220px|[[Khosrau II|Khosrow Parviz]] and [[Shirin]] in an 18th-century miniature]]\nThere are many references to the legend throughout the poetry of other Persian poets including Farrokhi, Qatran, Mas'ud-e Sa'd-e Salman, Othman Mokhtari, Naser Khusraw, Anwari and Sanai. [[Nizam al-Mulk]] mentioned that the legend was a popular story in his era.<ref name=\"iranica.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/farhad%20(1)|author=Heshmat Moayyad|title=Farhad |work=Encyclopedia Iranica |date=1999-12-15 |accessdate=2010-07-26}}</ref>\n\n===Nizami's version===\n\nAlthough the story was known before [[Nizami Ganjavi|Nizami]], it was brought to its greatest romantic height by him. Unlike the ''Shahnameh'', which focuses on the history, kingship and battles of Khosrow, Nizami decided to focus on the romantic aspect of the story.\n\nWhen the [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuq]] Sultan Arsalan Shah requested a love epic from the poet without specifying the subject further, Nizami picked on the story of lovers Khosrow and Shirin, a theme set in his own region and based on at least partly historical facts, though an aura of legend already surrounded it.\n\n[[Nizami Ganjavi]] (1141\u20131209) himself considered it the sweetest story in the world:\n\n{{cquote|The tale of Khosraw and Shirin is well known<br />\nAnd by Truth, there is no sweeter story than it.}}\n\nIt is believed to be one of the best works of Nizami. His first wife Afaq died after it was completed. Many versions of Nizami's work have been retold. The story has a constant forward drive with exposition, challenge, mystery, crisis, climax, resolution, and finally, catastrophe.\n\nBesides Ferdowsi, Nizami's poem was influenced by [[Asad Gorgani]] and his \"[[Vis and R\u0101min]]\".<ref name=\"DavisIranica\">{{cite web |author=Dick Davis |date=2005-01-06 |url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/vis-o-ramin |title=Vis o R\u0101min |work=Encyclopaedia Iranica  |accessdate=2008-04-25}}</ref> which is of the same meter and has similar scenes. Nizami's concern with astrology also has a precedent in the elaborate astrological description of the night sky in ''Vis and Ramin''. Nizami had a paramount influence on the romantic tradition, and Gorgani can be said to have initiated much of the distinctive rhetoric and poetic atmosphere of this tradition, with the absence of the [[Sufi]] influences, which are seen in Nizami's epic poetry.\n\n==Influence==\nAccording to the ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Iranica]]'': \"The influence of the legend of Farhad is not limited to literature, but permeates the whole of Persian culture, including folklore and the fine arts. Farhad's helve supposedly grew into a tree with medicinal qualities, and there are popular laments for Farhad, especially among the Kurds (Mokri).\"<ref name=\"iranica.com\"/>\n\nIn 2011, the Iranian government's censors refused permission for a publishing house to reprint the centuries-old classic poem that had been a much-loved component of Persian literature for 831 years. While the Iranian Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance offered no immediate official explanation for refusing to permit the firm to publish their eighth edition of the classic, the Islamic government's concerns reportedly centered on the \"indecent\" act of the heroine, Shirin, in embracing her husband.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/iranian_censors_heavy_hand_falls_on_a_persian_classic/24299532.html|title=Iranian Censors' Heavy Hand Falls On A Persian Classic|work=RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty}}</ref>\n\n[[Orhan Pamuk]]'s novel ''[[My Name Is Red]]'' (1998) has a plot line between two characters, Shekure and Black, which echoes the Khosrow and Shirin story, which is also retold in the book. The novel uses the Turkish spelling of Khosrow's name, H\u00fcsrev.\n\n==Other versions==\n\nThe tale has been retold by countless [[Sufi]] poets and writers in areas which were previously part of the Persian Empire or had Persian influences, such as the northern parts of the neighboring [[Indian subcontinent]]. In Europe, the story was told by Hungarian novelist [[M\u00f3r J\u00f3kai]]. However, the story is usually told under the name of \"Shirin Farhad\". It is a standard tale used in [[Punjabi Qisse]]. The story has been filmed five times:\n1926,<ref>{{imdb title|0239979|Shirin Farhad (1926)}}</ref>\n1931,<ref>{{imdb title|0234717|Shirin Farhad (1931)}}</ref>\n1945,<ref>{{imdb title|0387590|Shirin Farhad (1945)}}</ref>\n1956 starring [[Madhubala]] and [[Pradeep Kumar]]<ref>{{imdb title|0129370|Shirin Farhad (1956)}}</ref> and\n1975.<ref>{{imdb title|0318690|Shirin Farhad (1975)}}</ref>\n\nThe tale was used as the inspiration for a 2008 Iranian film, ''[[Shirin (film)|Shirin]]'', made by [[Abbas Kiarostami]]. In this formally unusual film, the story is told via the reactions of an audience of Iranian women as they sit watching the film in a cinema. The viewer has to divine the story by only ever seeing these emoting faces and listening to the film's soundtrack.\n\nThe story was also referenced in the [[Jonathan Richman and the Modern Lovers]] song \"Shirin & Fahrad\".\n\nThe tale was also an inspiration for the 2012 Bollywood romantic comedy ''[[Shirin Farhad Ki Toh Nikal Padi]]''.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Layla and Majnun]]\n*[[Vis and R\u0101min]]\n*[[Persian literature]]\n*[[Persian mythology]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n{{commonscat|Khosrow and Shirin}}\n* [http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/farhad%20(1) Encyclop\u00e6dia Iranica, \"Farhad\", Heshmat Moayyad]\n* [http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/kosrow-o-sirin Encyclop\u00e6dia Iranica, \"\u1e34OSROWO \u0160IRIN AND ITS IMITATIONS\", Paola Orsatti]\n* [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/1190nizami1.html Nizami: \"Khosru & Shireen\", Medieval Sourcebook]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20101020052438/http://www.iranian.com/main/blog/nazy-kaviani/story-khosrow-and-shirin-part-i The Story of Khosrow and Shirin at ''iranian.com'']\n* [https://www.scribd.com/doc/239673087/Shirin-Farhad-erotic-poetry The story of Farhad and Shirin]\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Khosrow And Shirin}}\n{{Shahnameh}}\n\n[[Category:12th-century books]]\n[[Category:Persian mythology]]\n[[Category:Persian poems]]\n[[Category:Medieval legends]]\n[[Category:Literary duos]]\n[[Category:Sufi literature]]\n[[Category:Love poems]]\n[[Category:World Digital Library]]\n[[Category:Historical poems]]\n[[Category:Shahnameh stories]]\n[[Category:Epic poems in Persian]]\n", "text_old": "{{Expand Azerbaijani|Xosrov v\u0259 \u015eirin (Nizami)|date=June 2015}}\n{{Nizami Ganjavi}}\n[[Image:Nizami - Khusraw discovers Shirin bathing in a pool.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Khosrau II|Khosrow Parviz]]'s first sight of Shirin, bathing in a pool, in a manuscript of [[Nizami Ganjavi|Nezami]]'s poem.

Finally, Khosrow goes to Shirin's castle to see her. Shirin, seeing that Khosrow is drunk, does not let him in the castle. She particularly reproaches Khosrow for his intimacy with Shekar. Khosrow, sad and rejected, returns to his palace.\n\nShirin eventually consents to marry Khosrow after several romantic and heroic episodes. Yet, [[Kavadh II|Shiroyeh]], Khosrow's son from his wife Mariam, is also in love with Shirin. Shiroyeh finally murders his father Khosrow and sends a messenger to Shirin conveying that after one week, she would have to marry him. Shirin, in order to avoid marrying Shiroy, kills herself. Khosrow and Shirin were buried together in the same grave.\n\n==Popularity in Persian literature==\n[[File:Khosrow and Shirin-page0085.jpeg|thumb|right|220px|[[Khosrau II|Khosrow Parviz]] and [[Shirin]] in an 18th-century miniature]]\nThere are many references to the legend throughout the poetry of other Persian poets including Farrokhi, Qatran, Mas'ud-e Sa'd-e Salman, Othman Mokhtari, Naser Khusraw, Anwari and Sanai. [[Nizam al-Mulk]] mentioned that the legend was a popular story in his era.<ref name=\"iranica.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/farhad%20(1)|author=Heshmat Moayyad|title=Farhad |work=Encyclopedia Iranica |date=1999-12-15 |accessdate=2010-07-26}}</ref>\n\n===Nizami's version===\n\nAlthough the story was known before [[Nizami Ganjavi|Nizami]], it was brought to its greatest romantic height by him. Unlike the ''Shahnameh'', which focuses on the history, kingship and battles of Khosrow, Nizami decided to focus on the romantic aspect of the story.\n\nWhen the [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuq]] Sultan Arsalan Shah requested a love epic from the poet without specifying the subject further, Nizami picked on the story of lovers Khosrow and Shirin, a theme set in his own region and based on at least partly historical facts, though an aura of legend already surrounded it.\n\n[[Nizami Ganjavi]] (1141\u20131209) himself considered it the sweetest story in the world:\n\n{{cquote|The tale of Khosraw and Shirin is well known<br />\nAnd by Truth, there is no sweeter story than it.}}\n\nIt is believed to be one of the best works of Nizami. His first wife Afaq died after it was completed. Many versions of Nizami's work have been retold. The story has a constant forward drive with exposition, challenge, mystery, crisis, climax, resolution, and finally, catastrophe.\n\nBesides Ferdowsi, Nizami's poem was influenced by [[Asad Gorgani]] and his \"[[Vis and R\u0101min]]\".<ref name=\"DavisIranica\">{{cite web |author=Dick Davis |date=2005-01-06 |url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/vis-o-ramin |title=Vis o R\u0101min |work=Encyclopaedia Iranica  |accessdate=2008-04-25}}</ref> which is of the same meter and has similar scenes. Nizami's concern with astrology also has a precedent in the elaborate astrological description of the night sky in ''Vis and Ramin''. Nizami had a paramount influence on the romantic tradition, and Gorgani can be said to have initiated much of the distinctive rhetoric and poetic atmosphere of this tradition, with the absence of the [[Sufi]] influences, which are seen in Nizami's epic poetry.\n\n==Influence==\nAccording to the ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Iranica]]'': \"The influence of the legend of Farhad is not limited to literature, but permeates the whole of Persian culture, including folklore and the fine arts. Farhad's helve supposedly grew into a tree with medicinal qualities, and there are popular laments for Farhad, especially among the Kurds (Mokri).\"<ref name=\"iranica.com\"/>\n\nIn 2011, the Iranian government's censors refused permission for a publishing house to reprint the centuries-old classic poem that had been a much-loved component of Persian literature for 831 years. While the Iranian Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance offered no immediate official explanation for refusing to permit the firm to publish their eighth edition of the classic, the Islamic government's concerns reportedly centered on the \"indecent\" act of the heroine, Shirin, in embracing her husband.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/iranian_censors_heavy_hand_falls_on_a_persian_classic/24299532.html|title=Iranian Censors' Heavy Hand Falls On A Persian Classic|work=RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty}}</ref>\n\n[[Orhan Pamuk]]'s novel ''[[My Name Is Red]]'' (1998) has a plot line between two characters, Shekure and Black, which echoes the Khosrow and Shirin story, which is also retold in the book. The novel uses the Turkish spelling of Khosrow's name, H\u00fcsrev.\n\n==Other versions==\n\nThe tale has been retold by countless [[Sufi]] poets and writers in areas which were previously part of the Persian Empire or had Persian influences, such as the northern parts of the neighboring [[Indian subcontinent]]. In Europe, the story was told by Hungarian novelist [[M\u00f3r J\u00f3kai]]. However, the story is usually told under the name of \"Shirin Farhad\". It is a standard tale used in [[Punjabi Qisse]]. The story has been filmed five times:\n1926,<ref>{{imdb title|0239979|Shirin Farhad (1926)}}</ref>\n1931,<ref>{{imdb title|0234717|Shirin Farhad (1931)}}</ref>\n1945,<ref>{{imdb title|0387590|Shirin Farhad (1945)}}</ref>\n1956 starring [[Madhubala]] and [[Pradeep Kumar]]<ref>{{imdb title|0129370|Shirin Farhad (1956)}}</ref> and\n1975.<ref>{{imdb title|0318690|Shirin Farhad (1975)}}</ref>\n\nThe tale was used as the inspiration for a 2008 Iranian film, ''[[Shirin (film)|Shirin]]'', made by [[Abbas Kiarostami]]. In this formally unusual film, the story is told via the reactions of an audience of Iranian women as they sit watching the film in a cinema. The viewer has to divine the story by only ever seeing these emoting faces and listening to the film's soundtrack.\n\nThe story was also referenced in the [[Jonathan Richman and the Modern Lovers]] song \"Shirin & Fahrad\".\n\nThe tale was also an inspiration for the 2012 Bollywood romantic comedy ''[[Shirin Farhad Ki Toh Nikal Padi]]''.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Layla and Majnun]]\n*[[Vis and R\u0101min]]\n*[[Persian literature]]\n*[[Persian mythology]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n{{commonscat|Khosrow and Shirin}}\n* [http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/farhad%20(1) Encyclop\u00e6dia Iranica, \"Farhad\", Heshmat Moayyad]\n* [http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/kosrow-o-sirin Encyclop\u00e6dia Iranica, \"\u1e34OSROWO \u0160IRIN AND ITS IMITATIONS\", Paola Orsatti]\n* [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/1190nizami1.html Nizami: \"Khosru & Shireen\", Medieval Sourcebook]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20101020052438/http://www.iranian.com/main/blog/nazy-kaviani/story-khosrow-and-shirin-part-i The Story of Khosrow and Shirin at ''iranian.com'']\n* [https://www.scribd.com/doc/239673087/Shirin-Farhad-erotic-poetry The story of Farhad and Shirin]\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Khosrow And Shirin}}\n{{Shahnameh}}\n\n[[Category:12th-century books]]\n[[Category:Persian mythology]]\n[[Category:Persian poems]]\n[[Category:Medieval legends]]\n[[Category:Literary duos]]\n[[Category:Sufi literature]]\n[[Category:Love poems]]\n[[Category:World Digital Library]]\n[[Category:Historical poems]]\n[[Category:Shahnameh stories]]\n[[Category:Epic poems in Persian]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200etop:Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: well-known \u2192 well known", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khosrow_and_Shirin"}

Within a short period of time he had developed his own style, characterized by the use of the primary colors red, yellow and blue.  The saturated colors and the expressive, dynamic compositions of his works often provoked strong reactions.<ref>'' Mecklenburgische Warte '', August 5, 1922</ref><ref>''Berliner Tageblatt'', March 3, 1922</ref>\n\nDuring this period Tschirch's intellectual involvement turned to the texts from the Old Testament's Song of Solomon.  A man and a woman alternate in professing their love for one another, using interplay to extol their longing and fulfillment, separation and reunion. Throughout this time Tschirch created more than 50 painted sheets of fantastic interpretations showing tension-filled choreography.<ref>''Mecklenburg. Tageszeitung G\u00fcstrow'', April 15, 1923</ref> The power of nature, the sensuality and the spirit in these paintings had a cathartic effect.\nHe was able to precisely capture the phenomena of light and shadow, warm and cold in nature. \nAs a result of his work with this topic and material, Tschirch selected 19 of his works and numbered them, in order to personally arrange them in expositions and when on display.<ref name=\"Artmapp Fr\u00fchjahr 2017\" />\n\n<gallery widths=\"132\" heights=\"180\" perrow=\"6\">\nEgon Tschirch- Hohelied Nr. 1 (high resolution).jpg|'''''No. 1'''''\nEgon Tschirch- Hohelied Nr. 2 (high resolution).jpg|'''''No. 2'''''\nEgon Tschirch- Hohelied Nr. 3 (high resolution).jpg|'''''No. 3'''''\nEgon Tschirch- Hohelied Nr. 4 (high resolution).jpg|'''''No. 4'''''\nEgon Tschirch- Hohelied Nr. 5 (high resolution).jpg|'''''No. 5''''' \nEgon Tschirch- Hohelied Nr. 6 (high resolution).jpg|'''''No. 6''''' \nEgon Tschirch- Hohelied Nr. 7 (high resolution).jpg|'''''No. 7''''' \nEgon Tschirch- Hohelied Nr. 8 (high resolution).jpg|'''''No. 8''''' \nEgon Tschirch- Hohelied Nr. 9 (high resolution).jpg|'''''No. 9''''' \nEgon Tschirch- Hohelied Nr. 10 (high resolution).jpg|'''''No. 10''''' \nEgon Tschirch- Hohelied Nr. 12 (high resolution).jpg|'''''No. 12''''' \nEgon Tschirch- Hohelied Nr. 13 (high resolution).jpg|'''''No. 13''''' \nEgon Tschirch- Hohelied Nr. 14 (high resolution).jpg|'''''No. 14''''' \nEgon Tschirch- Hohelied Nr. 15 (high resolution).jpg|'''''No. 15''''' \nEgon Tschirch- Hohelied Nr. 16 (high resolution).jpg|'''''No. 16''''' \nEgon Tschirch- Hohelied Nr. 17 (high resolution).jpg|'''''No. 17''''' \nEgon Tschirch- Hohelied Nr. 18 (high resolution).jpg|'''''No. 18''''' \nEgon Tschirch- Hohelied Nr. 19 (high resolution).jpg|'''''No. 19''''' \n</gallery>\n\n== Background ==\nSince 1913 Egon Tschirch had been working (with war-time interruptions) on the topic of the Song of Solomon.

Within a short period of time he had developed his own style, characterized by the use of the primary colors red, yellow and blue.  The saturated colors and the expressive, dynamic compositions of his works often provoked strong reactions.<ref>'' Mecklenburgische Warte '', August 5, 1922</ref><ref>''Berliner Tageblatt'', March 3, 1922</ref>\n\nDuring this period Tschirch\u2018s intellectual involvement turned to the texts from the Old Testament\u2019s Song of Solomon.  A man and a woman alternate in professing their love for one another, using interplay to extol their longing and fulfillment, separation and reunion. Throughout this time Tschirch created more than 50 painted sheets of fantastic interpretations showing tension-filled choreography.<ref>''Mecklenburg. Tageszeitung G\u00fcstrow'', April 15, 1923</ref> The power of nature, the sensuality and the spirit in these paintings had a cathartic effect.\nHe was able to precisely capture the phenomena of light and shadow, warm and cold in nature. \nAs a result of his work with this topic and material, Tschirch selected 19 of his works and numbered them, in order to personally arrange them in expositions and when on display.<ref name=\"Artmapp Fr\u00fchjahr 2017\" />\n\n<gallery widths=\"132\" heights=\"180\" perrow=\"6\">\nEgon Tschirch- Hohelied Nr. 1 (high resolution).jpg|'''''No. 1'''''\nEgon Tschirch- Hohelied Nr. 2 (high resolution).jpg|'''''No. 2'''''\nEgon Tschirch- Hohelied Nr. 3 (high resolution).jpg|'''''No. 3'''''\nEgon Tschirch- Hohelied Nr. 4 (high resolution).jpg|'''''No. 4'''''\nEgon Tschirch- Hohelied Nr. 5 (high resolution).jpg|'''''No. 5''''' \nEgon Tschirch- Hohelied Nr. 6 (high resolution).jpg|'''''No. 6''''' \nEgon Tschirch- Hohelied Nr. 7 (high resolution).jpg|'''''No. 7''''' \nEgon Tschirch- Hohelied Nr. 8 (high resolution).jpg|'''''No. 8''''' \nEgon Tschirch- Hohelied Nr. 9 (high resolution).jpg|'''''No. 9''''' \nEgon Tschirch- Hohelied Nr. 10 (high resolution).jpg|'''''No. 10''''' \nEgon Tschirch- Hohelied Nr. 12 (high resolution).jpg|'''''No. 12''''' \nEgon Tschirch- Hohelied Nr. 13 (high resolution).jpg|'''''No. 13''''' \nEgon Tschirch- Hohelied Nr. 14 (high resolution).jpg|'''''No. 14''''' \nEgon Tschirch- Hohelied Nr. 15 (high resolution).jpg|'''''No. 15''''' \nEgon Tschirch- Hohelied Nr. 16 (high resolution).jpg|'''''No. 16''''' \nEgon Tschirch- Hohelied Nr. 17 (high resolution).jpg|'''''No. 17''''' \nEgon Tschirch- Hohelied Nr. 18 (high resolution).jpg|'''''No. 18''''' \nEgon Tschirch- Hohelied Nr. 19 (high resolution).jpg|'''''No. 19''''' \n</gallery>\n\n== Background ==\nSince 1913 Egon Tschirch had been working (with war-time interruptions) on the topic of the Song of Solomon.  On Easter Sunday 1923, his special exhibit opened in the [[Abbey of the Holy Cross, Rostock|city museum of Rostock]].<ref name=\"Rostocker Anzeiger\">''Rostocker Anzeiger'', April 4, 1923</ref> It met with critical acclaim and thus in 1924 the [[Staatliches Museum Schwerin|state museum in Schwerin]] also showed this cycle of paintings.<ref name=\"Nachrichten Schwerin\">''Mecklenburger Nachrichten Schwerin'', March 2, 1924</ref>\n\nAfterwards, the works transferred to private ownership and then disappeared at the end of the 1920s into a basement in [[Berlin]], not far from the [[Kurf\u00fcrstendamm]].  The cycle of paintings was forgotten. The works were only rescued by chance from being discarded in 2008 and rediscovered in 2015. With the help of original newspaper reviews from the 1920s it was possible to recognize the theme of the works as belonging to the Song of Solomon cycle.<ref name=\"Rostocker Anzeiger\" /><ref name=\"Nachrichten Schwerin\" /> The remarkable find  encompassed a total of 32 original works, including all 19 numbered sheets as well as 13 studies.<ref name=\"Artmapp Fr\u00fchjahr 2017\" />\n\n<gallery class=\"center\">\n   Egon Tschirch- Hohelied Signatur.jpg|signature (No. 10)\n   Egon Tschirch- Hohelied Nummerierung.jpg|numbering (No. 12)\n   Egon Tschirch- Hohelied Studie J (high resolution).jpg|painted back (study J on No. 12)\n   Egon Tschirch- Hohelied Rezension 1923.jpg|1923 Rostock.
