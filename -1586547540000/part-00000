He led the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal Party]] in five general elections, winning four ([[1968 Canadian federal election|1968]], [[1972 Canadian federal election|1972]], [[1974 Canadian federal election|1974]] and [[1980 Canadian federal election|1980]]) and losing one ([[1979 Canadian federal election|1979]]).  He won majority governments in 1968, 1974 and 1980, and a minority government in the 1972 election.  With a total of fifteen years and 164 days in office, he is the third longest serving prime minister, after [[John A. Macdonald|Sir John A. Macdonald]].\n\nTrudeau succeeded [[Lester B. Pearson]] as prime minister in 1968.  After [[Joe Clark]] won the 1979 election, Trudeau resigned and became [[Leader of the Official Opposition (Canada)|Leader of the Opposition]].  The Clark government fell on a budget matter late in 1979 triggering the 1980 election, which returned Trudeau to office with a majority government.  He retired in 1984 and was succeeded as Liberal leader and prime minister by [[John Turner]].\n\nTrudeau stood for election to the [[House of Commons of Canada]] six times, all for the riding of [[Mount Royal (electoral district)|Mount Royal]] in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]].  He was elected with substantial majorities each time.\n\n== Summary ==\n\n[[File:Canada provinces 1949-1999.png|thumb|right|Canada had ten provinces and two territories throughout Trudeau's time as Prime Minister.]]\n\nTrudeau ranks third out of twenty-three prime ministers for [[List of Prime Ministers of Canada by time in office|time in office]], serving two terms totalling fifteen years and 164 days.<ref>[https://lop.parl.ca/sites/ParlInfo/default/en_CA/People/primeMinisters PARLINFO:  Prime Ministers of Canada.]</ref>\n\nTrudeau was the fourth of four prime ministers to serve non-consecutive terms, the others being [[John A. Macdonald|Sir John A. Macdonald]], [[Arthur Meighen]] and [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]].\n\nTrudeau was the fourth of eight prime ministers from Quebec, the others being [[John Abbott|Sir John Abbott]], [[Wilfrid Laurier|Sir Wilfrid Laurier]], [[Louis St. Laurent]], [[Brian Mulroney]], [[Jean Chr\u00e9tien]], [[Paul Martin]] and [[Justin Trudeau]].  He was also the third of five francophone prime ministers, the others being Laurier, St. Laurent, Chr\u00e9tien, and Justin Trudeau.\n\nBefore entering politics, Trudeau was a federal public servant, an academic at the Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al and a social activist, particularly during the [[Asbestos Strike]] and as a founder and frequent contributor to the magazine ''[[Cit\u00e9 libre]]''.<ref name = DCB>[http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/trudeau_pierre_elliott_22E.html ''Dictionary of Canadian Biography'':  \"Trudeau, Pierre Elliot\".]</ref>  Along with two other colleagues from ''Cit\u00e9 libre'', [[Gerard Pelletier]] and [[Jean Marchand]], he was invited by Prime Minister [[Lester Pearson]] to join the Liberal government in Ottawa to combat the rising [[Quebec separatism]].  Trudeau stood for election in [[Mount Royal (electoral district)|Mount Royal]] in the [[1965 Canadian federal election|general election of 1965]], winning the seat.  Pearson appointed him as his [[parliamentary secretary]] and then [[Minister of Justice (Canada)|Minister of Justice]].  Following Pearson's announcement of his retirement in 1968, Trudeau ran for the leadership of the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal party]] with Pearson's tacit support.<ref name = DCB-Pearson>[http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/pearson_lester_bowles_20E.html ''Dictionary of Canadian Biography'':  \"Pearson, Lester Bowles\".]</ref>   He won the leadership at the [[1968 Liberal Party of Canada leadership election|Liberal leadership convention of 1968]] and became Prime Minister.<ref name = DCB/>\n\nTrudeau led the Liberals in five general elections. He was successful in the general elections of 1968, 1972 (albeit with a minority government), and 1974, but was defeated by [[Joe Clark]] in the 1979 election.  However, Clark's minority government was defeated late in 1979, triggering another election in early 1980, which Trudeau won.<ref>[https://www.thestar.com/opinion/2009/12/11/behind_the_fall_of_joe_clark.html Allan McEachern, \"Behind the fall of Joe Clark\", ''Toronto Star'', December 11, 2009.]</ref>\n\nTrudeau stood for election to the [[House of Commons of Canada|House of Commons]] six times (1965, 1968, 1972, 1974, 1979 and 1980), each time in the riding of [[Mount Royal (electoral district)|Mount Royal]] in Montreal, Quebec.  He was elected with substantial majorities each election.  His lowest vote count, in the 1965 election, was 55.6%, out of a field of four candidates.  In his next election, in 1968 at the height of [[Trudeaumania]], he received 90.8% of the votes in the riding.  In the next four elections, he received over 70% in one election (1974), and over 80% of the votes in three elections (1972, 1979 and 1980).  Trudeau served in the House of Commons for 18 years, 7 months and 22 days.<ref>[https://lop.parl.ca/sites/ParlInfo/default/en_CA/People/Profile?personId=6230 PARLINFO:  The Right Hon.

Trudeau won on the fourth ballot by the narrow margin of 51.1% over the runner-up, [[Robert Winters]], who had 40.6% of the votes.  Future prime minister [[John Turner]] came in third, with 8.3% of the votes.

He led the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal Party]] in five general elections, winning four ([[1968 Canadian federal election|1968]], [[1972 Canadian federal election|1972]], [[1974 Canadian federal election|1974]] and [[1980 Canadian federal election|1980]]) and losing one ([[1979 Canadian federal election|1979]]).  He won majority governments in 1968, 1974 and 1980, and a minority government in the 1972 election.  With a total of fifteen years and 164 days in office, he is the third longest serving prime minister, after [[John A. Macdonald|Sir John A. Macdonald]].\n\nTrudeau succeeded [[Lester B. Pearson]] as prime minister in 1968.  After [[Joe Clark]] won the 1979 election, Trudeau resigned and became [[Leader of the Official Opposition (Canada)|Leader of the Opposition]].  The Clark government fell on a budget matter late in 1979 triggering the 1980 election, which returned Trudeau to office with a majority government.  He retired in 1984 and was succeeded as Liberal leader and prime minister by [[John Turner]].\n\nTrudeau stood for election to the [[House of Commons of Canada]] six times, all for the riding of [[Mount Royal (electoral district)|Mount Royal]] in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]].  He was elected with substantial majorities each time.\n\n== Summary ==\n\n[[File:Canada provinces 1949-1999.png|thumb|right|Canada had ten provinces and two territories throughout Trudeau's time as Prime Minister.]]\n\nTrudeau ranks third out of twenty-three prime ministers for [[List of Prime Ministers of Canada by time in office|time in office]], serving two terms totalling fifteen years and 164 days.<ref>[https://lop.parl.ca/sites/ParlInfo/default/en_CA/People/primeMinisters PARLINFO:  Prime Ministers of Canada.]</ref>\n\nTrudeau was the fourth of four prime ministers to serve non-consecutive terms, the others being [[John A.

He was also the third of five francophone prime ministers, the others being Laurier, St. Laurent, Chr\u00e9tien, and Justin Trudeau.\n\nBefore entering politics, Trudeau was a federal public servant, an academic at the Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al and a social activist, particularly during the [[Asbestos Strike]] and as a founder and frequent contributor to the magazine ''[[Cit\u00e9 libre]]''.<ref name = DCB>[http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/trudeau_pierre_elliott_22E.html ''Dictionary of Canadian Biography'':  \"Trudeau, Pierre Elliot\".]</ref>  Along with two other colleagues from ''Cit\u00e9 libre'', [[Gerard Pelletier]] and [[Jean Marchand]], he was invited by Prime Minister [[Lester Pearson]] to join the Liberal government in Ottawa to combat the rising [[Quebec separatism]].  Trudeau stood for election in [[Mount Royal (electoral district)|Mount Royal]] in the [[1965 Canadian federal election|general election of 1965]], winning the seat.  Pearson appointed him as his [[parliamentary secretary]] and then [[Minister of Justice (Canada)|Minister of Justice]].

He was successful in the general elections of 1968, 1972 (albeit with a minority government), and 1974, but was defeated by [[Joe Clark]] in the 1979 election.  However, Clark's minority government was defeated late in 1979, triggering another election in early 1980, which Trudeau won.<ref>[https://www.thestar.com/opinion/2009/12/11/behind_the_fall_of_joe_clark.html Allan McEachern, \"Behind the fall of Joe Clark\", ''Toronto Star'', December 11, 2009.]</ref>\n\nTrudeau stood for election to the [[House of Commons of Canada|House of Commons]] six times (1965, 1968, 1972, 1974, 1979 and 1980), each time in the riding of [[Mount Royal (electoral district)|Mount Royal]] in Montreal, Quebec.  He was elected with substantial majorities each election.  His lowest vote count, in the 1965 election, was 55.6%, out of a field of four candidates.  In his next election, in 1968 at the height of [[Trudeaumania]], he received 90.8% of the votes in the riding.  In the next four elections, he received over 70% in one election (1974), and over 80% of the votes in three elections (1972, 1979 and 1980).

Martin</span>''[[Wild Cards]]''<br /> by [[George R. R. Martin]]\n|The Black Trump virus is a variant of Xenovirus Takis-B. Rather than a cure, this retrovirus was designed to kill aces, jokers, latents, and wild card carriers. [[Dr. Tachyon]]'s original Trump virus was designed to turn wild carders back into nats (a slang term for naturals), those who do not carry Xenovirus Takis-A in their system.\n|-\n|Bloodfire\n|''[[Blood Nation]]''\n|A virus that gestated in [[Gray wolf|wolves]] two thousand years ago. The first to be infected was [[Genghis Khan]]. It causes the symptoms usually associated with [[vampirism]], [[photosensitivity]] and invincibility. The entire nation of Russia is infected, except for a few [[feral]] children. The virus can cause extreme [[mutation]], for example the snake's tail present in the Khan's head scientist.\n|-\n|[[Brainpox]] \"Cobra\"\n|''[[The Cobra Event]]''\n|A genetically engineered [[recombinant virus]] made from the [[nuclear polyhedrosis virus]], the [[rhinovirus]], and [[smallpox]].

Created as a biological weapon codenamed Blue. Causes a lethally high fever and is highly contagious. It is deadly because as the body fights off the disease, it mutates into different strains of influenza, making [[Immunity (medical)|immunity]] next to impossible.\n|-\n|Clone-Killing Nanovirus\n|''[[Star Wars Republic Commando: Hard Contact]]''<br />by [[Karen Traviss]]\n|A nanovirus developed by the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems]] designed specifically to kill the [[cloning|clones]] of Jango Fett. Its creator, Ovolot Qail Uthan, is captured by Republic Commandos before her research is complete, however. In later books in the series, it is revealed (though not to any of the main characters, but to the reader through both Palpatine's and Dr. Uthan's private journals), [[Chancellor Palpatine]] secretly chooses not to completely destroy all evidence or research of the virus, but rather opts to hold onto it as a back-up plan, should the clone army ever be turned against him.\n|-\n|Collins' Syndrome\n|''[[The Legend of Deathwalker]]'' by [[David Gemmell]]\n|A mutating disease that often starts with pain and sensitivity in the victims nipples, then forms a temporary tumor in the brain as it feeds upon the genetic material of the brain cells, sapping away the victims critical thinking skills and intelligence, once it reaches its critical density, the tumor disbands into the bloodstream, the virus going into a form of hibernation, leaving its victim in a state of near absolute uselessness.  Once the virus detects that it has entered a new host due to differences in protein markers of the victims cells, the process begins again.\n|-\n|Gray brittle death\n|''[[The Colour Out of Space]]'' by [[H. P. Lovecraft]]\n|A disease caused by infection with an alien entity called \"[[Colour out of space (species)|The colour]]\" by characters in the story, the disease affects anything living, including plants, insects, livestock, wild animals, and humans. Symptoms in plants include either stunting or growing abnormally large with lots of tasteless fruit and growing abnormally-shaped flowers and leaves followed by glowing in the dark with an indescribable color and finally losing their leaves and crumbling to gray dust. Insects become strangely bloated and oddly shaped before crumbling into grey dust. Livestock such as hogs grow abnormally large with tasteless meat before wasting away and crumbling to grey dust, while cattle and horses exhibit strange behavior followed by crumbling into a grey powder. In some of the wild animals, the disease causes animals to leave \"strange footprints in the snow\" that are recognizable as known animals but are off in anatomy and behavior, and rabbits have abnormally long strides. In humans, the disease causes its victims to slowly go insane and see things that are not there, talk incoherently, suffer memory loss followed by walking on all fours. The victim then begins glowing in the dark with an indescribable color and becoming increasingly weak and thin before crumbling to grey dust.\nHuman victims describe \"being drained of something\" or \"having the life sucked out\".\n|-\n|[[Cooties]]\n|Various\n|A term used by children in the United States, with varied meaning. \"Cooties\" generally refers to an invisible germ, bug, or microscopic monster, transferred by skin to skin contact, usually with a member of the opposite sex.<ref>{{citation | author = Sue Samuelson | title = The Cooties Complex | volume = 39 | date = July 1980 | pages = 198\u2013210 | publisher = Western States Folklore Society | jstor = 1499801 | journal = Western Folklore | issue = 3 }}</ref>\n|-\n| Curse of the Warmbloods\n| ''[[The Underland Chronicles]]'' by [[Suzanne Collins]]\n| A disease created by Doctor Neveeve in the city of Regalia. She gave the disease to fleas, which instead of getting infected, spread the disease around warm-blooded creatures, including people. Symptoms include purple blemishes, coughing, choking, and a swelled tongue. The cure was originally believed to be a plant named starshade, though the true cure was made in Regalia.\n|-\n|[[Dar-Kosis]]\n|''[[Gor]]''<br />by [[John Norman]]\n|Dar-kosis is a virulent, horrible, wasting disease and is similar in many ways to leprosy. It is taught by the Initiates (who claim to be the voice of the Priest-Kings of Gor) that Dar-Kosis is a holy disease.\n|-\n|Death Stench\n|''[[Gyo]]'' by [[Junji Ito]]\n|A virus designed by the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] during WWII, it was designed to be paired up with mechanical walking machines to carry infected hosts further towards enemies to be sickened. The Death Stench was let loose on Japan when the ship carrying the prototypes was destroyed by allied aircraft; the virus then began multiplying, synthesising new walking machines by harvesting iron from shipwrecks until the present day, when large quantities of infected sea life began invading the [[Kanto region]]. The Death Stench disease causes its hosts - which can range from fish to humans and other large mammals - to visibly bloat, and begin producing large quantities of gas containing the virus; when attached to a walking machine, this gas powers the machine's legs, which will remain active until its victim decays away and is no longer able to produce enough gas to make the machine move. It appears that the virus is airborne, although it can also be contracted via being attached to a vacant walking machine; amputating a limb that has become attached to a smaller walking machine is the only way to escape, and even then the machine will still use the limb as a 'power source'.\n|-\n|[[Demon Pox]]\n|''[[The Infernal Devices]]''<br />by [[Cassandra Clare]]\n|Demon pox, also known as astriola, is a rare but debilitating disease that affects Shadowhunters and is caused by sexual contact with demons.\nMundanes are immune to the disease, as demon pox is assumed to be caused by the interaction of demon poisons with the angelic nature of Shadowhunters.\n|-\n|[[Descolada]]\n|''[[Speaker for the Dead]]''<br />by [[Orson Scott Card]]\n|A quasi-conscious self-modifying organism capable of infecting any form of life. \"Descolada\" is also the Portuguese word for \"unglued\". In the context of the book, this refers to the Descolada virus's effects: it breaks the link of the [[DNA double helix]] (ungluing it) and induces mutations.\n|-\n|Despotellis\n|''[[Green Lantern Corps]]''\n| A sentient virus and a member of the Sinestro Corps. It could create non-sentient duplicates of itself creating a plague capable of killing infected victims within minutes, and can also destroy these duplicates, leaving no trace of their presence. Among the victims of its plague was [[Kyle Rayner]]'s mother.\n|-\n|Diseasemaker's Croup\n|''[[Fragile Things]]'' by [[Neil Gaiman]]\n|A disorder 'afflicting those who habitually and pathologically catalogue and construct diseases.' It is characterized by increasingly nonsensical speech and writing patterns and an obsessive insistence on trying to repeat previous statements out of context.\n|-\n|[[Dragon Pox]]\n|''[[Harry Potter|The Harry Potter Series]]''<br />by [[J.K. Rowling]]\n|Dragon pox is a potentially fatal contagious disease that occurs in wizards and witches. Its symptoms are presumably similar to Muggle illnesses like smallpox and chicken pox. However, in addition to leaving the victim's skin pockmarked, dragon pox causes a lasting greenish tinge. Simpler cases present with a green-and-purple rash between the toes and sparks coming out of the nostrils when the patient sneezes. Elderly patients are apparently more susceptible to dragon pox than younger ones. Gunhilda of Gorsemoor developed a cure for dragon pox, but the disease has not been completely eradicated, as is evidenced by the fact that it is still treated by the Magical Bugs ward at St. Mungo's Hospital.\n|-\n|Dryditch Fever\n|''[[Salamandastron]]''<br /> by [[Brian Jacques]]\n|A deadly disease causing weakness, hot flashes, chills, and dizziness. The victim is usually bedridden until eventual death. The only known cure are Flowers of Icetor boiled in spring water.\n|-\n|DX\n|''[[The Lost World (Crichton novel)|The Lost World]]''<br />by [[Michael Crichton]]\n|An unknown [[prion]] dubbed \"DX\" by scientists on Isla Sorna. It is similar to [[mad cow disease]] and was the result of feeding ground-up sheep to carnivorous dinosaurs. DX increased the mortality rate of newborn dinosaurs and is eventually fatal to adult dinosaurs. In order to combat DX, InGen scientists released animals into the wild of Isla Sorna. The prion initially infected carnivorous dinosaurs such as [[velociraptor]]s and [[procompsognathus]], which would then spread the disease to herbivores such as [[apatosaurus]], and the apatosaur carcasses would be eaten by compys, which would then spread the disease to other carcasses, and the cycle would repeat. Ian Malcolm said at the end of the novel that, because of the imbalance of carnivores and herbivores due to DX, the dinosaurs were doomed to die out.\n|-\n|Ebola Gulf A\n|[[DC Comics]]\n|Also known as \"the Clench\", due to the victims clenching their stomachs, Ebola Gulf is an evolved form of the [[Ebola|ebola virus]] created by the terrorist mastermind [[Ra's al Ghul]] after he consulted the ''Wheel of Plagues.''\n|- id=\"Fire-Us\"\n|Fire-Us (Sounds like \"Virus\")\n|[[Jennifer Armstrong#Fire-Us Trilogy|Fire-Us series]]\n|A viral infection that infects extremely fast and only infects those that produce sex hormones (i.e. those after puberty and women before menopause) or are taking medicine that includes similar hormones. It was released by the President of the United States of America to start the world over, killing almost all adults within 2 weeks. As a result, children were left to fend for themselves, most of whom failed. Once all the targets of the virus were gone, it died out.\n|-\n|The Flare (virus VC321xb47)\n|''[[The Maze Runner (series)|The Maze Runner]]''\n|A highly contagious virus that infects the brain of its host, turning them into crazed blood-thirsty cannibals (essentially zombies) that are called Cranks. Less than 1% of the population is immune to the virus, and are called Munies. There is no cure for The Flare, but many wealthy people slow down the onslaught of the symptoms with an illegal drug called The Bliss, which slows down their brain activity. It was released by the governments of the world to help control overpopulation after the Sun Flares, but it eventually killed most of the people in the world.\n|-\n|Foul-Drought\n|<span style=\"display:none\">Heir of Mistmantle by M. I. McAllister</span>''[[The Heir of Mistmantle]]''<br /> by [[M. I. McAllister]]\n|Disease caused from drinking poisoned water. Animals who have it will have pain, blurry sight and some will eventually die.\n|-\n|<span style=\"display:none\">Gray Death</span>The Gray Death\n|[[Gail Carson Levine]]'s ''[[The Two Princesses of Bamarre]]''\n|Disease created from the noxious gas from the defeated dragon Yune's stomach. It comes on with no warning and is not contagious. There are three stages of the disease. The first stage is the weakness, and it can last anywhere from a week to six months. The second stage is the sleeping, and it always lasts nine days. The last stage is fever, and it always lasts three days. At the end of the fever stage, the victim will die. The only cure is water sent down from the fairies' Mount Ziriat. The cure will only be discovered ''when cowards find courage and rain falls over all Bamarre.''\n|-\n|Great Plague\n|''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]\n|A mysterious disease that swept down through every single kingdom of [[Middle-earth]] during the mid-1600s of the Third Age of the Sun. The Plague's origins are unknown except it was possibly contracted from the Corsairs who attacked [[Gondor]] in Third Age 1634, two years before the Plague occurred. The Plague was 90% fatal for nearly all inhabitants of Middle-earth, especially in Gondor and the North. It is Based on the [[Black Death]].\n|-\n|Greyscale\n|''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]''\n|Greyscale is a typically nonfatal disease akin to [[leprosy]]. It is first introduced in Stannis Baratheon's daughter Shireen. When it infects children, greyscale generally leaves children malformed and disabled but alive. However, in ''[[A Dance with Dragons]]'', it is revealed to be generally fatal to adults. The disease is contracted by touch and slowly turns the skin (small patches in children and the entire body in adults) of the victim to into a gray, stone-like form. It is said that the disease also drives its adult victims insane.\n|-\n|Hanahaki Disease, or Hanahaki Byou\n|Japanese, Korean, and Chinese pop band, anime, and manga fandoms\n|Hanahaki Disease (\u82b1\u5410\u304d\u75c5 (Japanese); \ud558\ub098\ud558\ud0a4\ubcd1 (Korean); \u82b1\u5410\u75c5 (Chinese)) is a fictional disease where the victim of unrequited or one-sided love begins to vomit or cough up the petals and flowers of a flowering plant growing in their lungs, which will eventually grow large enough to render breathing impossible if left untreated. There is no set time for how long this disease lasts but it may last from 2 weeks to 3 months until the victim dies unless the feelings are returned or the plants are surgically removed.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.2twinz.com/hanahaki-disease/ |title=Hanahaki Disease |author=Jack Cyrus |date=February 16, 2020 |publisher=[[2Twinz]] |access-date=February 25, 2020}}</ref> There is also no set flower that blossoms in the lungs but it may be the enamoured\u2019s favourite flower or favourite colour.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/700157/standout-tales-of-love-survival-and-fantasy-from-high-school-writers |title=Standout tales of love, survival and fantasy from high school writers |last= Jumamil |first=Jannah Corrine B. |date=June 23, 2015 |website=Inquirer.net |access-date=January 15, 2018}}</ref> Hanahaki can be cured through surgical removal of the plants' roots, but this excision also has the effect of removing the patient's capacity for romantic love. It may also erase the patient\u2019s feelings for and memories of the enamoured. It can also be cured by the reciprocation of the victim's feelings. These feelings cannot be feelings of friendship but must be feelings of genuine love. The victim may also develop Hanahaki Disease if they believe the love to be one-sided but once the enamoured returns the feelings, they will be cured.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://fanlore.org/wiki/Hanahaki_Disease |title=Hanahaki Disease |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=September 21, 2017 |publisher=[[Fanlore]] |access-date=January 15, 2018}}</ref>\n|-\n|Hawaiian Cat Flu\n|''[[Garfield]]'' by [[Jim Davis (cartoonist)|Jim Davis]]\n|A rare disease only contracted by cats.

It acted like both a biological virus and a computer virus, and could be spread to each type of victim by the other type. It was capable of wiping out humanity in twenty-four hours.\n|-\n|I-Pollen Degenerative Disorder\n|[[DC Comics]]\n[[Transmetropolitan]]\n|The hero Spider Jerusalem has I-Pollen Degenerative Disorder, a disease he gained as a result of coming into contact with Information Pollen, pollen used to transmit information. In 98% of the cases, the disease will cause the victim to lose all motor and cognitive skills. It is comparable to [[Alzheimer's]] and [[Parkinson's]] disease.\n|-\n|Inferno virus\n|''[[Inferno (Brown novel)|Inferno]]''<br>by [[Dan Brown]]\n|An airborne virus that incubated in water. It was released by the terrorist group the Consortium to kill off half of humanity and reproduce with only a third of ten individuals who were immune. The virus was modeled on the [[Black Death]]. Originally, its creator, Bertrand Zobrist, planned to have it as a waterborne virus, but changed it to airborne because it could infect faster. The Inferno virus can infect a human through damp air, and then it renders humans infertile. The plan was for the infected to die off and humanity to be rendered extinct.\n|-\n|Kellis-Amberlee\n|''[[Feed (Grant novel)|Feed]]''<br /> by [[Mira Grant]]\n|A spontaneous combination of two man-made viruses that exists in a 'reservoir condition' state without ill effects until the host's death, when any host over approximately 40 pounds undergoes virus amplification and becomes a zombie.\n|-\n|Krytos virus\n|<span style=\"display:none\">Star Wars Expanded Universe</span>\"[[Star Wars expanded universe|''Star Wars'' expanded universe]]\"\n|The Krytos virus was a deadly and highly contagious virus that only attacked non-human species.

The virus eats itself when there is nothing else to attack. It is quite effective against Tyrranids. In the short-story anthology ''Planetkill'', an updated strain goes after the [[soul]], turning the population into zombies, created by a Techpriest inhabited by a daemonic Unclean One.\n|-\n|Love Sickness\n|''[[One Piece]]''\n|A mostly psychosomatic disease that can only be contracted by the empress of the [[#Kuja Tribe|Kuja Tribe]] if she falls in love with a man and denies the feeling. It causes weakness, pain, and eventually death from declining health. The only known cure is for the victim to accept the emotions and pursue the object of her desire.

This plague, originally coming from the northern Indian kingdoms in La Guajira (Colombia), is identified by the symptoms of wide-open, glowing eyes like those of a cat, and the [[insomnia|impossibility of sleeping]]. Those infected (in the novel consisting of the entire town of Macondo) feel no tiredness or sleepiness whatsoever and hence can work all day and night. However, as time advances, those infected begin to [[amnesia|lose all their memories]] and [[epistemology|knowledge of the world]]; ultimately leaving them in a state in which they have forgotten the names and uses of all things and their own identities. The plague is generally seen as one of the most prominent demonstrations of [[magical realism]] in Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez's literary works.\n|-\n|The Pulse\n|''[[Cell (novel)|Cell]]'' by [[Stephen King]]\n|A powerful virus that lies dormant inside [[mobile phones]] and which requires a powerful signal to set off. The exact unleashers are unknown, but are implied to be a terrorist group due to numerous theories in the novel. The virus is implied to have been released just after [[September 11th, 2001|September 11th]], and lain dormant in cell phones ever since. Once the right signal is transmitted and leaked into incoming phone calls, the caller's brain cells immediately disintegrate and they are unable to recognize friend from foe; they are even unable to recognize other people infected with the virus. Inevitably, the infected callers become psychotic and start killing each other, the chaos of which lasts approximately two days before the infected callers have become \"stable\" enough to cooperate and recognize each other.\n|-\n|Ratititis\n|[[Boy (book)|Roald Dahl's Boy]]\n|A fictional disease invented by [[Roald Dahl]]'s friend Thwaites during their schooldays in [[Llandaff]]. Thwaites made this up to amuse Roald and the other friends, but he says his dad told him about the disease, which is apparently contracted from eating [[liquorice|liquorice bootlaces]]. Thwaites says that the bootlaces actually have rat's blood rather than licquorice, and they are done this way by rat-catchers bringing their rats to the sweet factory where they pound the rats into a paste, then mash it up to form licquorice bootlaces. Thwaites told Roald and his friends never to eat them, because if they did, a rat's tail would burst out of their buttocks and their teeth would turn into fangs.

There is no known medical cure for the disease.\n|-\n|Sakutia\n|[[DC Comics]]\n|Sakutia, also known as Green Fever, is an extremely rare lethal viral disease found primarily in the African region of Lamumba. The virus attaches itself to a victim's DNA, enabling the host body to instinctively rewrite their own genetic code. Typically, a host relies upon primitive instinct when affecting such a change, rendering them capable of shapeshifting into a wide variety of forms (usually animals). Sakutia victims suffer from one other noticeable side effect: their hair and skin turn permanently green in hue. \n|-\n|Salt Plague\n|Spiritwalker Trilogy<br />by [[Kate Elliott]]\n|Disease that feeds on the salt in its host's body.

Vedet involves personality disorders and dementia; sevai usually leads to blindness and other sensory loss, along with degeneration of muscle control. Both diseases are painful, crippling, incurable, and fatal. Severity of onset and the length of the course of the illness vary: major damage leads to non-viability in the womb (with a quarter of all children in the Valley being stillborn due to sevai); minor damage might not show up until old age and lead to death in a decade.\n|-\n|Shame\n|''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]''<br />by [[Douglas Adams]]\n|Mentioned as being \"still a terminal disease in some parts of the Galaxy,\" this disease seems rife amongst the population of Betelgeuse 5, the fifth planet of the sun [[Betelgeuse]].

Centuries later, Darth Scabrous successfully completed Drear's unfinished work, but accidentally modified it into a semi-sentient hive mind that creates zombies. The Sith academy on Odacin-Fauster was wiped out by the plague. Thousands of years later, Darth Vader commissioned the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Empire]]'s bioweapons division to recreate the virus. Upon completion, the virus was loaded onto the Star Destroyer ''Vector'' for transport to a testing site. En route, the tanks leaked and the Destroyer's crew was zombified. The virus is characterized by grey goo.\n|-\n|Snow Crash\n|''[[Snow Crash]]''<br />by [[Neal Stephenson]]\n|A dangerous drug that is both a [[computer virus]] capable of infecting the brains of unwary hackers in the Metaverse and a mind-altering virus distributed by a network of [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal churches]] via its infrastructure and belief system. Both forms cause [[glossolalia]], and the computer virus form appears as a snowy pattern of pixels.\n|-\n|Solanum Virus\n|''[[World War Z]]''/''[[The Zombie Survival Guide]]'' by [[Max Brooks]]\n|A virus that has existed since the beginning of human history, which is highly contagious through bodily fluids such as [[blood]]. Solanum symptoms include [[dementia]], [[paralysis]] in the extremities, and discoloration of the wound, which increase as the virus replicates itself. The virus is centered on the brain, and destroys the cells of the brain and replaces them with the virus. In doing so, the infected victims are declared clinically dead. The virus takes around sixteen hours to replicate, although it varies from individual to individual. Once Solanum has fully replicated, the victim awakes from the coma, with an unquenchable desire for [[cannibalism|human flesh]]. The victim also exhibits typical zombie-like behavior such as psychotic behavior and mindless rage, and can only be killed by destruction of the brain.\n|-\n|Space plague\n|[[Alisa Selezneva]] books<br />by [[Kir Bulychov]]\n|A lethal, extremely contagious virus responsible for destroying numerous inhabited planets. Difficult to combat due to the virus being very good in mimicry, as well as capable of forming a [[Group mind (science fiction)|hive mind]] that could direct its own mutations.

It may be a type of fungus, as [[Ron Weasley]] says that the effect of being unable to speak occurs \"once the fungus has spread to your uvula\". The only known cure, according to the portrait of a Healer in [[St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries]], is to bind the [[liver]] of a [[toad]] around the victim's throat and stand [[nude]] in a barrel of [[eel]]'s eyes under a full moon. The portrait said that he believed Ron had this disease, due to the \"[[Freckle|unsightly blemishes]]\" on his face. Ron would later use this disease in [[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]] as an excuse as to why he was unable to return to [[Hogwarts]], when in actuality he and his friends were out searching for [[Lord Voldemort]]'s [[Horcruxes]].\n|-\n| Stand Virus\n|''[[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure]]''\n|Passed down through family, however it is not hereditary. When a person is infected their family members will be infected at around the same time. It comes from a meteorite that was later made into several arrows. The symptoms of the virus are and intense, untreatable fever. If the person infected has enough willpower and survives, they earn a stand ability that is a manifestation of their soul. Not everybody suffers through the fever before obtaining a stand.\n|-\n|Stone Sickness\n|''[[The Edge Chronicles]]'' by [[Paul Stewart (writer)|Paul Stewart]] and [[Chris Riddell]]\n|Not a human disease, but one that affects humans and other inhabitants of the Edge by attacking the rocks of the flight ships that are the primary means of transport and communication on the Edge. As the flight ships are carried aloft by the rocks, this puts an end to business and trade, resulting in a brief societal collapse followed by a gradual rebuilding of society when the Edge's inhabitants become accustomed to life with Stone-sickness. Symptoms of infected flight rocks include a brief scar, followed by an open wound and a gaping hole as the rock dissolves. Eventually the sky ship drops clean out of the sky. Many theories abound on the origin of Stone-sickness. Some people blame the gods. Others blame the Mother Storm, the mysterious meteorological creator of the Edge. Some say that the sky pirate captain Cloud Wolf who perished in the Mother Storm somehow infected her and the Stone-sickness is a result of his pestilence. It is only at the end of the series that it is revealed the Gloamglozer created the disease and it had been incubating inside the Stone Gardens ever since he fled the city of Sanctaphrax almost a century before the sickness.\n|-\n|Stripes\n|''[[A Bad Case of Stripes]]'' by [[David Shannon]]\n|An unnamed disease that causes the affected individual to change color/pattern when names of patterns are used. Apparently it can only be cured and prevented by lima beans.\n|-\n|[[Smallpox|Super-smallpox]]\n|''[[Stormbreaker]]''\n|A genetically engineered version of the smallpox virus that Iraq made in the Gulf War. Herod Sayle used the disease in his plans for vengeance. He genetically modified it so it would kill whoever it infected immediately. Fortunately, the plan was stopped by Alex and the virus was taken and quarantined by MI6. Implied in ''Snakehead'' that Sayle acquired the virus (apparently the R-5) from SCORPIA, a SPECTRE-like criminal organisation that sponsored his project.\n|-\n|\"T4 Angel Virus\"\n|''[[The Hollows (series)|Hollows (series)]]'' by [[Kim Harrison]]\n|The result of genetic engineering, the T4 Angel Virus was spread by infected tomatoes. It wiped out a large percentage of humanity, along with the elves and several other species that had been secretly coexisting.

When a human is infected by it, the disease will infect all cells, eventually resulting in the [[clinical death]] of the host. The symptoms that occur before the victim's clinical death, include [[fever]], [[headache]], [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], [[confusion]], [[hallucinations]] and [[paralysis]]. The disease has a very short [[incubation period]] of around 16 hours. After the victim's clinical death, the host will be revitalized and will wake up exhibiting [[zombie (fictional)|zombie]]-like behavior. However the disease will only activate lower brain function, mostly those controlled by the brain-stem, where feeding and motor functions are controlled. The host becomes a violent mindless [[cannibal]], and can infect other people by biting. The disease leads to society's collapse and results in a world stricken by a [[zombie apocalypse]]. The transmission of TS-19 has been variable and inconsistent in the media: A person that dies of asphyxiation will become reanimated by the virus, implying an airborne capability, yet it does not affect living humans. A pregnant woman that recently gives birth to a child will most likely succumb to the virus due to less-than-sanitary conditions and a weakened immune system.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} And walkers can transmit the virus through scratches and bites but not through blood and other bodily fluids making contact with a living person's skin.\n|-\n|V-CIDS\n|<span style=\"display:none\">Immortals</span>''[[The Immortals (Hickman novel)|The Immortals]]''\n|An [[AIDS]]-like virus.\n|-\n|Vampiris\n|''[[I Am Legend (novel)|I Am Legend]]''<br />by [[Richard Matheson]]\n|A [[bacillus]] (rod-shaped) bacterium that causes photosensitivity, hysterical blindness near mirrors, overdevelopment of canine teeth, and production of a bulletproof adhesive.

It has been theorized that the process is guided by the victim's own subconscious, influenced by the person's desires or fears. In this way, the virus works as a modern Aladdin's Lamp. The transformation is extremely individual, no two persons are affected in exactly the same way. In 90% of cases, the victim's body cannot assimilate the extreme changes, and the person dies horribly. These cases are called black queens. From the survivors, 9 out of 10 are changed for the worse, becoming monstrous creatures nicknamed jokers.

The trump virus is only successful in about twenty-four percent of attempts. Forty-seven percent of the time it doesn't work at all, and an appalling twenty-nine percent of the time, it outright kills the patient. In other words, it is more likely to kill than cure.

The first symptom of the disease is usually a painful rash, which develops into a scabby or weeping wound. In later stages, tissues become soft and slough away. The initial rash stage can be exacerbated by harsh physical trauma, as was seen when one afflicted woman discovered hand-shaped rashes on her body, where she had recently been tightly held during a passionate [[one night stand|sexual encounter]]. It also seemed to indicate that physical exertion also accelerates the progression of the disease. The disease is transmitted when an infected creatures' blood is exposed to a victim's bloodstream (bare skin contact with infectious blood is implied to not result in infection). It can also be contracted through [[sexually transmitted diseases|unprotected sexual activity]] and by [[Waterborne diseases|drinking contaminated water]]. The disease spreads cross-species and was initially discovered in a dead dog. Where the dog contracted the disease is unknown.

Infected humans who did not die began exhibiting early symptoms of [[rabies]] and degenerated into a state driven by rage. A major symptom is that the [[adrenal gland]]s are \"permanently open\", giving victims increased strength, speed and agility but also a faster [[metabolism]]. This results in increased [[body temperature]], [[heart rate]], and breathing speed, making those infected [[hyperventilation|hyperventilate]] constantly.

Here, it is an untreatable, terminal condition which is nearly pain-free, but which leads to coma and death within a couple of weeks to a couple of months at the most. It is explained as a recently discovered condition, described by and named for Sir Trevor Lampington, a character who also appears in the plot. In the [[Last Holiday (2006 film)|2006 remake]], the disease has morphed into a neurological disease causing multiple [[brain tumor]]s, rapidly progressing to death within a few weeks if not treated with an exorbitant operation.\n|-\n|MM88\n|''[[Virus (1980 film)|Virus]]''\n| MM88 is a deadly type of [[virus]] created accidentally by an American [[geneticist]] that amplifies the potency of any other virus or bacterium it comes into contact with. It has a 100% mortality rate; however, the virus is inactive at temperatures below -10 degrees Celsius. The virus is stolen and is found in [[East Germany]], and during an attempt to steal it back it is released accidentally after the plane carrying it crashes. A [[pandemic]] spreads worldwide and is dubbed the \"Italian Flu\". Eventually wiping out all vertebrate life on Earth except for a grouping of Antarctic scientists and submariner's from various nations, the survivors set up a government council at the various research stations at the time of the devastating global pandemic and attempt to survive; however, the air worldwide is contaminated, making Antarctica the only safe place for the roughly 800 or so survivors.\n|-\n\n|MacGregor's Syndrome\n|''[[Batman & Robin (film)|Batman & Robin]]''\n|A four-stage disease that [[Mr. Freeze]]'s wife, [[Nora Fries|Nora]], was suffering from and was placed in [[Cryopreservation|cryogenic stasis]] for. The film also revealed that [[Batman]]'s butler, [[Alfred Pennyworth]], was also suffering from Stage-1 MacGregor's. Mr. Freeze successfully created the antidote for Stage-1 of the disease, and gave some of it to Batman as an apology for thinking that Batman killed Nora (which was actually a lie fabricated by [[Poison Ivy (comics)|Poison Ivy]]).\n|-\n|Mad Zombie Disease\n|''[[Zombieland]]''\n|The disease which caused people, upon receiving a bite from one of the infected, to become zombies.

During the wizard's duel, Merlin had transformed himself into the germ that caused this disease and infected Madam Mim with it, causing her to become sick and lose the duel.\n|-\n|Meningoencephalitis Virus One (MEV-1)\n|''[[Contagion (2011 film)|Contagion]]''\n|A highly contagious and lethal [[Paramyxoviridae|paramyxovirus]] that infects both the lungs and the brain, causing coughing, fever and severe headache, progressing over the period of a few hours to seizures and ultimately death.\n|-\n|Methuselah Syndrome\n|''[[Blade Runner]]''\n|A genetic disease resembling [[progeria]] that causes faster aging.\n|-\n|Motaba\n|''[[Outbreak (film)|Outbreak]]''\n|A deadly, virulent [[Ebola]]-like [[virus]] from the jungles of Zaire, which later infected a fictional California town within a few days.\n|-\n|Nerve Attenuation Syndrome (NAS)\n|''[[Johnny Mnemonic (film)|Johnny Mnemonic]]''\n|AKA \"The Black Shakes,\" Progressive seizure disorder prevalent in society due to the overabundance of technology and the use of cybernetics. Attacks are sporadic, but become more frequent over time until the victim expires.\n|-\n|Neurological Degeneration Syndrome, or NDS\n|''[[Absolon (film)|Absolon]]''\n|A highly-contagious airborne virus, released into the atmosphere from the destruction of the Amazon rainforest causes quick and painful deaths.  The only way of controlling the virus is expensive, daily, painful injections of the drug Absolon. Society has been rebuilt on the sale of Absolon, a multibillion-dollar + industry. A detective [[Christopher Lambert]] searches for the killer who murdered the scientist who has found a cure for NDS, potentially making Absolon worthless.\n|-\n|NRS and UBT\n|''[[Demolition Man (film)|Demolition Man]]''\n|These are the names of two [[sexually transmitted disease|STD]] epidemics that occurred during the thirty-six years Spartan was incarcerated via cybergenics, and both were presumably just as bad as the [[HIV]] outbreak, both of which made sex, kissing, and even touching each other both illegal and greatly feared by the populace.\n|-\n|<span style=\"display:none\">Patriot</span>\n|''[[The Patriot (1998 film)|The Patriot]] (1998)''\n|A unnamed highly contagious airborne virus which has been stolen from a government [[biological warfare]] laboratory. Its early symptoms include a rash, and it is quickly fatal. It is not clear in the film whether the virus was supposed to have been harvested from the wild (such as [[Ebola]]) and then grown as a weapon, or whether the laboratory first engineered it in some way. In the film, the leader of a local militia has obtained both the virus and what he believes to be a [[vaccine]] for it, and decides to start an epidemic with the virus, believing that he will be safe because he has taken the vaccine. A local doctor of Indian (Native American) ancestry fights to find a cure for it.\n|-\n|[[Rage (virus)|Rage (Human Cortico-Deficiency Virus)]]\n|''[[28 Days Later]]''<br />''[[28 Weeks Later]]''\n|Rage causes extreme [[aggression]] in a victim ten to thirty seconds after being Infected with the disease. The disease is easily transmissible through any [[body fluid|bodily fluid]], except apparently semen. Because of this [[Infectious disease|extreme contagiousness]] and very short [[Incubation period|incubation time]], a crowd of hundreds could be infected by one single individual in a manner of minutes. A [[28 Days Later: The Aftermath|graphic novel]] based on the films purports that Rage is a [[recombinant virus|recombinant strain]] of [[Ebola]], though its symptoms are similar to that of [[rabies]]. Animal testing was being performed on the disease but one animal was released by activists unaware of the virus. The [[infection]] soon spread to eliminate the entire population of Britain save a few lucky individuals who managed to survive. Infected organisms die out in a few months, succumbing to [[starvation]], since they do not actually eat their victims. They also seem to drool blood constantly, due to the virus causing massive amounts of adrenaline to be pumped through the body, giving the infected heightened strength and endurance, to the point where they are able to completely overlook devastating injuries, such as loss of limbs. The infected also sport red eye colour, and bleed from the eyes, mouth and nose.\n|-\n|Reaper\n|''[[Doomsday (2008 film)|Doomsday]]''\n|Reaper causes effects similar to [[bubonic plague]]. It appeared in Scotland in the year 2008 and killed most of the inhabitants. Scotland was put under quarantine. Some decades later, Reaper reappears in London. A cure is found several days later, but it is unknown whether or not it will be given to the population.\n|-\n|Red Death\n|''[[Osmosis Jones]]''\n|Thrax, the film's main antagonist, was a strain of this disease.

This disease was thought up on the spot by Ace after he realizes that the people in the bar think poorly of Ray Finkle.\n|-\n| ALZ-112, ALZ-113, \"Simian Flu\"\n|[[Planet of the Apes]] reboot series\n|A genetically engineered retrovirus that was created in Gen-sys Laboratories in San Francisco. It was originally designed to be a cure for [[Alzheimer's disease]]. The ALZ-112 increased intelligence in apes and cured humans but only for a temporary period because of their immune systems creating antibodies to fight the virus. ALZ-113 was a stronger version of the drug, but it developed into a viral airborne and contact strain that wiped out most of the human race leaving only 1 in 500 immune to the virus. In humans it developed symptoms including sneezing, headache, sore throat, fever, vomiting, red eyes, coughing and finally death. The virus later mutates and causes temporary bleeding from the nose and mouth and degenerates most humans into a more [[caveman]]-like state by making them lose their ability to speak and making them less intelligent. In [[apes]] it increases their intelligence beyond that of a normal humans, makes their irises green, gives them a more human locomotion, such as extended upright walking and usage of primitive weapons in a human manner and alters their vocal cords to that of a humans, granting them the power of speech.\n|-\n|SP-43\n|[[Derailed (2002 film)|''Derailed'' (2002)]]\n|SP-43 is a modified form of [[smallpox]] (variola) that has an extremely short incubation period. Its development is part of the back story, which is not completely clear, but given the fact that it appears to have been stolen in Slovakia and is being transported to Munich by a NATO agent, it appears to have been developed by the [[Czechoslovakian|Czechoslovak]] government or some other [[Eastern Bloc]] country during the Cold War.\n|-\n|Space Herpes\n|[[The Ice Pirates]]\n|Extremely dangerous. In its dormant form it can be activated by heat and moisture.

If it enters another animal, it fuses with every cell of the host, possessing the host entirely. Each infected cell becomes an individual life form with its own desire to survive. An infected cell will seek out other cells to infect with its virus, and will work together with other infected cells to imitate other life forms. Because infected cells can rapidly duplicate and shapeshift, and because dislocated, pieces of an infected host will shapeshift and become separate entities. Infected hosts can only be killed if every individual cell is destroyed. Finally, hosts retain their knowledge and memories, allowing the virus to perfectly imitate any person and remain undetected. The only effective way of killing the Thing monsters is through incineration, for instance with a flamethrower.\n|-\n|Tunguska Spores\n|''[[Metallica|''Metallica's'']] [[All Nightmare Long|All Nightmare Long]]'' Music Video\n|Extraterrestrial spores resembling armored worms that mimic other cells in a foreign organism helping the host and if the host is deceased the spores will proceed to revive the organism, However use of the spores results with unreasonable anger. \n|-\n|Wexler's Curtain (Autotoxic Hematosa)\n| [[Short Time (film)|''Short Time'']]\n|\"A progressive blood disorder in which the lymphatic system actually attacks the red blood cells, mistaking them for an invading virus.

Caused by a synthetic T-cell which mistakenly activated introns in one's DNA.  Named for Lt. Reginald Barclay who first contracted the disease when he was administered the synthetic T-cell due to a genetic condition which when left on its own was inactive.  Said synthetic T-cell caused all dormant introns to activate rather than the defective T-cell.\n|-\n|Bendii Syndrome\n|''[[Sarek (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Star Trek: The Next Generation]]''\n|A degenerative neurological illness that occasionally afflicts some elderly Vulcans. Symptoms include a gradual loss of emotional control and a telepathic influence on non-Vulcans to exhibit similar emotional volatility.

A man (played by [[Jason Sudeikis]]) used it as a fake explanation for why he constantly got [[erections]] around a woman, Amber (played by [[Anne Hathaway]]), he was secretly attracted to though claiming to be [[gay]]. However, she honestly believed him, because she \"read the Bonerplasia article on Wikipedia\", only for the man to then reveal \"I actually wrote that article\".\n|-\n|Bonus Eruptus\n| ''[[The Simpsons]]''\n|A likely made-up condition described by [[Dr. Nick Riviera]] in ''[[22 Short Films About Springfield]]'' where the victim's skeleton tries to leap out of the body through the mouth and run away.\n|-\n|Bowden's Malady\n|''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]''\n|A degenerative disease that affects the bone and muscle, the only known treatment being a drug called Pescaline D. The disease is considered a \"quirk\" of planetary terraforming \u2013 the result of underground air mixing with a mine's ore processors.\n|-\n| Chen-7\n|''[[Doctor Who]]: [[The Girl Who Waited]]''\n| An airborne infectious disease that only infects species with two hearts.

After almost every Muppet catches it, guest star [[Roger Miller]] (who claims to have had it once) assures [[Kermit the Frog|Kermit]] that it goes away by itself in a few days. Also, because [[The Great Gonzo|Gonzo]] doesn't catch it, and he tends to hang around chickens a lot, he likely has developed an immunity to it. \n|-\n|Condiment Dysfunction\n|''[[Soyracha]] ([[TV Commercial]])''\n|Condiment Dysfunction is the inability to salivate due to a lack of flavor.\n|-\n|Cordilla Virus\n|''[[24 (TV series)|24]]''\n|The Cordilla virus was a type 3 immuno-pulmonary virus that is similar to the Hantavirus. The incubation period of the virus was initially 14 hours but decreased significantly as a result of a weaponized variant added. The symptoms of the virus were nose-bleeds, hemorrhaging, skin abscesses and eventually death.\n|-\n|Cosmic rust\n|''[[Transformers (fiction)|Transformers]]''\n|A disease which affects Cybertronians and possibly other mechanical lifeforms caused by a micro organism that feeds on metal.

This can usually only be cured by a series of painful [[Injection (medicine)|injections]]. A rumored alternate cure is to soak the hands and feet in buckets of a substance called zypholic acid, which can be found in lizard [[urine]]. The hands and feet must be soaked for no less than 45 minutes. Megan tricks Drake into thinking he has this disease because he ate a cookie that was hers, and later states, \"You know, there's another cure: Next time, don't eat my big cookie.\"\n|-\n|Desperation Disease\n|''[[Eureka 7]]''\n|A disease that strikes randomly and has no known vector of contagion. Individuals gradually become detached from the world until they are completely catatonic. The name of the disease does not come from the victims' state, who seem to be communing with something [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]], but rather, from their families who despair of trying to wake them.\n|-\n|Dark Gundam Cells\n|''[[Mobile Fighter G Gundam]]''\n|Nanomachines from the Devil Gundam (Dark Gundam in North American dub) infect living organisms and undergo mitosis, allowing the Devil Gundam to control the victim. The victim will gain super-strength and self-recovery abilities and if inside a Mobile Fighter, will spread the cells to the Mobile Fighter and give it the abilities of the Devil Gundam, often mutating the Mobile Fighter into a stronger robot. If the cells have not reached the brain, the victim can be cured.\n|-\n|Diminished Gluteal Syndrome (DGS)\n|''[[King of the Hill]]''\n|A fictional genetic disorder characterized by a person being born without buttocks, forcing them to sit on their tailbone and cause pain in their back.

Without such signals from the brain, the organs lose their ability to function correctly, much like [[ALS]] in humans. It is only contagious among those alien species which used specialized cells to produce neurotransmitters, and among these species, it is 100% terminal within 24 hours of the onset of symptoms. Initial symptoms include dizziness, numbness & tingling in the extremities, sore throat, followed by progressively worsening ascending paralysis, euphoria, memory issues, then death. Fortunately for most of the other sentient races in Babylon 5, their lack of such specialized neurotransmitter cells render them immune to the disease, save for the Pak'Ma'Ra, whose Green Cells were similar enough to the Markab Yellow Cells that a Pak'Ma'Ra died of it on the station. The disease caused the Markab to go extinct.\n\nSimilar to the Black Death and HIV/AIDS among Humans, the Drafa Plague bears a stigma among the Markab as a disease that the public felt was only caught by those considered sinful, immoral or unclean by Markab standards, and a punishment by their gods for committing such acts. The disease was named after an island on their homeworld where its inhabitants were wiped out by the disease, an island noted in Markab history for its decadence and immorality. The story of the island was eventually used to frighten small Markab children into behaving. Even accusing a Markab of being infected with the disease can bring shame, paranoia, fear, and an angry response from the accused, and Markab doctors would frequently certify someone's death from the disease as death by natural causes, so the family could avoid a scandal and the implied accusation that they or their family were unclean or immoral.\n|-\n|Ecola\n|''[[Spaceballs: The Animated Series]]''\n|[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]] and [[Ebola]] injected into a carbonated drink, creating a \"deadly soda that will kill our enemies.\" Drinking the soda causes immediate and profuse vomiting, which then spreads the disease.

Curable by having the Pok\u00e9mon expunge the excess electricity.\n|-\n|[[Epideme]]\n|''[[Red Dwarf]]''\n|An intelligent virus, originally devised as a smoking cure. It was intended as a cure nicotine addiction, but in practice it rapidly consumes the host before hijacking the body, and then attempting to transfer itself to another suitable host via bites or saliva transmission. If no hosts are available, epideme can force its host into a state of hibernation, encasing the body in a tomb of ice-like material until it detects life nearby and thaws. Epideme steals the knowledge from every host it consumes, which has crafted it into an extremely smart, eccentric and deadly virus.\n|-\n|[[European flu]]\n|''[[Survivors (2008 TV series)]]''\n|A strain of flu based on the real [[Spanish flu]], but has killed 99.9% of mankind.\n|-\n|Fluvus Pestilentia\n|''[[Grimm (TV series)|Grimm]] ([[Quill (Grimm)|Quill]])''\n|An enterobacteria affecting only Wesen, characterised by lack of inhibitions, strong affection, yellow boils, and, finally, psychosis.\n|-\n|Fried Chicken Flu  (KFC virus)\n|''[[The Fried Chicken Flu]] ([[Boondocks]])''\n|Actually [[salmonella]], but initially believed to be something far worse, causing the collapse of several governments before the real cause is revealed.\n|-\n|Genie Flu\n|''[[Genie in the House]]''\n|A disease of Genies which causes them to change colours, become invisible and have squeaky voices.\n|-\n|Geodermic granititis\n|''[[Look Around You]]''\n|A disease that attacks the central nervous system, fooling it into calcifying the bodily tissue, eventually turning the victim into a pile of rocks. More commonly known as '''cobbles'''.\n|-\n|[[Cyberbrain Sclerosis#Cyberbrains|Cyberbrain Sclerosis]]\n|''[[Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex]]''\n|A disease characterized by a hardening of the brain tissues precipitated by the cyberization process. It is described as being that century's cancer or tuberculosis. Cyberbrain [[Sclerosis (medicine)|Sclerosis]] is described as being extremely rare, enough so that it doesn't deter most people from being cyberized, but it is incurable once diagnosed.\n|-\n|Ghost Sickness\n|''[[Supernatural (U.S. TV series)|Supernatural]]''\n|A sickness which is contracted from prolonged proximity with ghosts, which causes hallucinations, fever, chills and extreme fear. [[Dean Winchester]] contracted this disease from an evil ghost he encountered and became immensely afraid of every single thing he encountered, even being afraid of a cat. The vanquishing of the ghost defeated the disease.\n|-\n|Groat's Disease\n|''[[Curb Your Enthusiasm]]''\n|A neurological disorder presumed to have a high mortality rate through a slow, painful process. [[Rob Reiner]] describes it affecting \"kids and adults who have a tough time controlling their hyperactivity. It is as if you were on five cups of coffee at all times.\" It was named after the doctor who discovered it. Larry David, who writes the show, came up with the name of the disease when he thought baseball player [[Dick Groat]]'s name sounded like the name of a disease and in the show Larry assumes it was named for Dick Groat, who he assumes must have had the disease because, as Larry says, \"he didn't field very well because he was excited all the time.\"\n|-\n|Hades\n|''[[Covert One: The Hades Factor]]''\n|A blood-borne/airborne virus that causes severe internal hemorrhaging and bleeding from every orifice.

Kills within another 24 hours.\n|-\n|Hate Plague\n|''[[Transformers (fiction)|Transformers]]''\n|[[Bacteria]]l [[spore]] of unknown origin transmitted by touch. Induces extreme [[paranoia]] and [[aggression]] in the infected, causing them to strike out against anyone or anything in an increasingly maddening desire to destroy. Symptoms include a deep reddish glow emanating from the infected. The only curative is intense logic and wisdom, which presumably counters the extreme irrationality the disease causes in its victims. First appearing during the Autobot-Decepticon wars (which necessitated the second resurrection of Optimus Prime), a relatively milder strain is seen again during the events of Beast Machines; Megatron triggers a pre-planted virus in Silverbolt, infecting him and the rest of the Maximals.

Referred to players as \"the Plague\", \"Hakkar's [[SARS]]\" or \"WoW [[AIDS]]\" for a major outbreak of the [[virtual plague]] in the game due to a design oversight.\n|-\n|Creeping Derangea\n|''[[Advance Wars: Days of Ruin]]''\n|An artificial virus that is revealed to be a failed Bio-Weapon created by Dr. Caulder to test the extent of IDS technology. Due to its inherent flaw of photophobia, creeping derangea is only able to thrive when the sun was effectively blocked out by the vast amounts of dust that were kicked up into the troposphere and stratosphere by the apocalyptic meteor impact events. The Virus is initially only able to infect those under the age of 20 but a new strain is somehow introduced that can infect older hosts over time. Symptoms include headaches, paranoia, and a black diamond on the skin called \"the mark\". It causes flowers to grow inside a person and break out of the skin. A beautiful, albeit excruciatingly painful, way to die. Its scientific name is Endoflorescens terribilis. It is also known as The Creeper and the Green Thumb.\n|-\n|C-Virus\n|''[[Resident Evil]]'' series\n|A further evolved version of the T-Virus. Developed by Neo-Umbrella, it is responsible for creating the highly evolved, more intelligent J'avo, as well as being used in the worldwide bio-terrorist attacks. Jake Muller, being descended from [[Albert Wesker]], is resistant to the disease. Because of this, Jake is seemingly being hunted by Ada Wong and her agents.<ref>{{cite web| url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65Cpvq0gXl4|title = Resident Evil 6, C-Virus trailer|publisher = [[YouTube]] | accessdate = 2012-06-26}}</ref>\n|-\n|Cuvier Syndrome\n|''[[Digital Devil Saga 2]]''\n|Caused by exposure to corrupted sunlight, this noncommunicable disease petrifies the bodies of its victims, literally turning them to stone. The rate of petrification seems based on the level of sunlight exposure: one victim in full sunlight attempted suicide, but was unable to pull the trigger before being petrified. Carriers of the Atma Virus are immune.\n|-\n|Desert Herpes\n|''[[Wasteland (video game)|Wasteland]]''\n|A [[sexually transmitted disease]] that the player's character contracts if he sleeps with the three-legged prostitute he meets in the game.\n|-\n|Despair Disease\n|''[[Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair]]''\n|A pathogen created by Monokuma in order to drive the students into paranoia and irritability. Its effects depend on the person it infects: Nagito Komaeda's symptoms caused him to impulsively lie, Akane Owari became a coward, Ibuki Mioda became emotionless and gullible, and it caused Mikan Tsumiki to remember the events prior to having her memory erased. The disease wore off once there was another victim in the killing game.\n|-\n|Diathronitis\n|''[[Larn (computer game)|Larn]]''\n|Afflicts daughter of player character; serves as primary motivation for gameplay.\n|-\n|Dire AIDS\n|[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]\n|A form of AIDS that causes minor health drain when the player's turn begins. Its contracted by being hit by the physical attacks of wildlife in Canada. Going to the hospital in Canada can \"cure\" the player, but an unlockable achievement requires the player to defeat the final boss while infected.\n|-\n|Doll Syndrome\n|<span style=\"display:none\">hack GU</span>''[[.hack//G.U.]]''\n|A mysterious medical condition in which a person falls into a completely unresponsive state. Doll Syndrome is in fact a physical side effect to an infection by [[AIDA (.hack)|AIDA]]. Salvador Aihara tries to do an undercover investigation regarding Doll Syndrome in especially young children for his show \"Online Jack\".\n|-\n|Element 115\n|Call of Duty: Online, Call of Duty: Black Ops\n|Element 115 was used to create the zombies as one of its side effects was the reanimation of dead cells. The zombies were to be used as super-soldiers by the Nazis. After creating them, the Nazis realized that they were uncontrollable and would lead to mankind's destruction. Can be combined with Nova 6 to create dirty bombs.\n|-\n|Shiva I-VII\n|''[[Fallen Earth]]''\n|The SHIVA virus, or at least SHIVA I, is hinted to be an airborne virus with a quick infection exposure time, and therefore has qualities much like a modern chemical weapon. Overall the SHIVA virus appears as seven distinct forms, with naming conventions of SHIVA I through SHIVA VII, with the seventh version being mostly non-lethal. The virus is named after Shiva, the Hindu God of death due to the dance-like convulsions that it causes its victims\n|-\n|The Filth\n|''[[The Secret World]]''\n|A biological weapon willed into existence by the Dreamers in their attempts to free themselves from captivity, it manifests in a variety of forms, including poisonous gas, parasitic fungi, radio waves, and even words. The most common variant takes the form of a viscous black fluid. Exposure to the Filth results in nightmares, respiratory difficulties, paranoia, delusions, violent behavior, and eventual insanity; mutations gradually set in, resulting in victims manifesting glowing red eyes, tentacles, and exuding Filth from their skin. Sufferers ultimately fall under the influence of the Dreamers and are devoted either to releasing them from their prisons or continuing the spread of the disease. Further mutations may occur following this stage, and more exotic forms of the Filth can result in more unusual symptoms, one rare case transforming the victim into a [[Ghost|disembodied intelligence]] migrating between infected individuals. No cure exists.\n|-\n|[[Flood (Halo)|Flood Parasite]]\n|''[[Halo (series)|Halo]]''\n|The Flood Parasite is depicted in the Halo franchise as a [[parasitoid]] [[fungus]]-like pathogen that mutates infected hosts into creatures similar to [[zombie (fictional)|zombies]]. Depending on the size or condition of the Host's body, the Flood will either uses the host as-is to pursue new victims, or break it down to create \"pure forms\" from its biomass.\n|-\n|Forced Evolutionary Virus\n|''[[Fallout (series)|Fallout]]''\n|Originally known as the Pan-Immunity Viron Project, FEV, along with radiation, is responsible for many mutations in the wastelands. The most visible of these are the super mutants, former humans granted incredible strength and endurance as result of being infected. Exposure to the virus is also known to be fatal in many cases. FEV serves as a major plot element in Fallout, Fallout 2 and Fallout 3. Super mutants also appear in Fallout: New Vegas and Fallout 4.\n|-\n|FoxDie\n|''[[Metal Gear Solid (1998 video game)|Metal Gear Solid]]''\n|FoxDie is a virus responsible for killing people with certain genetic markers via cardiac arrest. FoxDie is given to protagonist Solid Snake by Dr. Naomi Hunter, only it is engineered to go off at an indeterminate time. FoxDie was also the cause of death of Liquid Snake, Decoy Octopus (impersonating DARPA chief Donald Anderson), and the ArmsTech President.\n|-\n|Frenzy Virus\n|''[[Monster Hunter 4]]''\n|The Frenzy Virus is an infectious disease originating in monsters Gore Magala and Shagaru Magala. It is transmitted through the air via black mistlike particles, or through contact with an infected specimen. Symptoms of the Frenzy Virus in monsters include heightened aggression, increased physical prowess, and a significantly shortened lifespan. In rare cases, a sufficiently powerful monster can overcome the virus. Such monsters are referred to as Apex monsters, and they obtain a strengthened version of the benefits of the virus without the main drawbacks. Player controlled hunters can also be infected, which gives them a limited amount of time before the virus activates and temporarily removes their natural regeneration. It also makes attacks from Gore Magala, Chaotic Gore Magala (A Gore Magala that has not properly shed its skin and become Shagaru Magala) Shagaru Magala, or a frenzied monster much more lethal than normal.  If a hunter manages to show enough aggression before this activation occurs, they overcome the virus, avoiding all negative effects and gaining a short-term increase in physical ability.\n|-\n|G-Virus\n|''[[Resident Evil]]'' series\n|A [[mutagenic]] pathogen which causes the host to become a big, constantly evolving, practically unstoppable killing machine, with exceedingly high attack power and immense vitality, in addition to the ability to [[regeneration (biology)|regenerate]] and mutate so quickly the carrier virtually loses its mortality. The purified virus can be injected directly into the host, or a mutated host can implant a small [[larva]]e, called a G-embryo into another host. The latter mode of transmission is most successful when the host and the new victim are genetically similar. The virus would later be merged with the T-Virus by Umbrella scientists in an attempt to balance the G-virus' rapid evolution with the T-virus' stability, creating an extremely dangerous, [[electromagnetic]]-capable variant called the T/G Virus.\n|-\n|Gagne\n|''[[Michigan: Report from Hell]]''\n|An experimental bioweapon that was developed in a consortium by the ZaKa Conglomerate, the U.S. Government, and the U.S. Military. It is a mutagenic virus that can be transmitted in the air and by contact with body fluids. Gagne takes the form of a thick fog that has covered the entirety of Chicago, Illinois and is causing animals and people to horrifically transform into grotesque monsters with large maws that can spawn leech-like larvae.\n* Stage 1: No discernible changes in physical appearance and body temperature. Actions become sluggish.\n* Stage 2: Subject begins to spawn leech-like larvae which are violently spewed from the mouth.\n* Stage 3: Subject undergoes horrific transformation and becomes aggressive and sensitive to nearby sounds.\n|-\n|Gangliated Utrophin Immuno Latency Toxin (GUILT)\n|''[[Trauma Center: Under the Knife]]''\n|A series of eight parasitic pathogens created by the medical-terrorist group Delphi. Despite its ingame introduction as a toxin, GUILT is referred as a \"moving tumor\", but behaves more like a parasite. During ingame sequences where the player operates on patients, GUILT diseases are normally shown as a pseudo-sentient core that attacks the patient from within, using lacerations, tumors and other ailments. Individual strains are named after Greek days of the week (Kyriaki, Deftera, Triti, Tetarti, Pempti, Paraskevi, Savato), the only exception being the eighth strain, called \"Bliss\". Neo-GUILT strains, which were developed independently from the original GUILT project, introduce four more strains (Nous, Bythos, Sige, Aletheia). Some GUILT survivors were also inflicted with a variation of the disease, dubbed the PGS (Post-GUILT syndrome).\n|-\n|Genophage\n|''[[Mass Effect]]''\n|A biological weapon created by the Salarians and deployed against the krogan species, designed to dramatically reduce the normal birth rate by infecting the species with genetic mutations. The plague causes most krogan pregnancies to end in stillbirth, with most fetuses never even reaching that stage of development.\n|-\n|Gray Death\n|''[[Deus Ex (video game)|Deus Ex]]''\n|A [[pandemic|global plague]] engineered using [[nanotechnology]] within a [[Universal assembler|Universal Constructor]] by [[Majestic-12]], the Gray Death virus is actually a hybrid ([[cyborg]]anic) disease of biological and mechanical structures. It is based on the adverse and ultimately lethal effects of nanotechnology on an unmodified human body. Named the Gray Death because of the gray patches of discolored [[scar|scar tissue]] that cover its victims' skins, if and when the disease is cured. Symptoms include the aforementioned discoloration of the skin, [[cough]]ing, physical [[pain]] and death.\n|-\n|Hyper-evolutionary virus\n|''[[StarCraft]]''\n|The Hyper-evolutionary virus is a [[retrovirus]] produced by Zerg Queens. It is used to mutate \"lesser\" creatures into zerg warrior breeds. Only a small percent of humanity is fully compatible, who retain personality, intelligence, and psionics. Others mutate into living bombs, utterly dominated by the Overmind. It has a re-animation side-effect. It is transmissible through fluid transfer only, much like [[Solanum]].\n|-\n|\"Harran Virus\" (Previously Unknown)\n|''[[Dying Light]]''\n|A previously mysterious rabies-like pathogen, the Harran Virus was spread within the city of Harran (likely based in Turkey) to epidemic proportions, placing the city under quarantine. As a result, many victims of the virus are initially turned into aggressive and athletic infected (called \"Virals\") before decaying into hordes of shambling and cannibalistic infected (called \"Biters\"). With this said, some of those infected by the virus may mutate into various creatures. Once the sun goes down, the pathogen alters the infected's motor-coordination and sensory, resulting the sluggish infected turning agile and vicious at night (called \"Night Walkers\") and mutated inhuman infected (called \"Volatiles\") with severe muscle exposure coming out only at night to hunt any uninfected survivors. During the night, the infected's primary weakness is [[Ultraviolet]], while the infected during the day have no specified weakness.\n|-\n|Incuritis\n|''[[Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney]]''\n|A rare, but lethal disease, curable only through the use of a medicine made from the Borginian Cocoon. The cure is very difficult to make, and if made incorrectly, it is a deadly poison, and thus the exportation of such a cocoon is illegal. The Chief Justice's son is afflicted with the disease.\n|-\n|Kepral's Syndrome\n|''[[Mass Effect 2]]''\n|A degenerative respiratory disease unique to [[Races of the Mass Effect universe#Drell|Drell]], occurring as a result of their transition from their desert homeworld of Rakhana to the Hanar ocean homeworld of Kahje; cumulative exposure to moisture results in a condition that erodes their capacity to absorb oxygen into their lungs, eventually resulting in death. It is noncommunicable, and there is currently no known cure, though its progression can be slowed through exposure to warm, arid environments.\n|-\n|Kharaa Bacterium\n|''[[Subnautica]]'' \n|Kharaa is an alien bacterium discovered by the Precursor Race during the exploration of an unknown planet. It seems to have completely taken over Planet 4546B. It is described in the Degasi PDAs as \"part of the ecosystem\", with further statements that the Degasi survivors were infected at some point - as stated by Bart Torgal while discussing the flu-like symptoms the crew was experiencing. Early on, the player's PDA and Lifepod will make note of the high levels of bacterial infection in the water. The PDA notes that Kharaa is unlike any infection thus discovered in human history, suggesting that Kharaa's biological design is far more drastic compared to diseases such as Yersinia pestis.The PDA estimates that Kharaa incubates in two weeks and quickly kills its host after it reaches a substantial infection level. It accomplishes this by shutting down the immune system (already making the infected host susceptible to other diseases) and causing genetic mutation to the host's DNA, and causing alterations to the body structure, eventually leading to a total shutdown of the organism due to its inability to keep functioning properly. \n|-\n|[[Las Plagas]]\n|''[[Resident Evil]]'' series\n|A [[parasitic]], organism which can infect a variety of [[Host (biology)|hosts]], including humans. It has the ability to control its host's behavior, inducing a [[Group mind (science fiction)|hive-like mentality]] among the infected and extreme hostility towards uninfected individuals. The infected retain most of the characteristics of humans such as fine [[motor skill]]s as seen through their use of simple weapons such as [[scythe]]s and [[axe]]s, and more complicated weapons such as [[chainsaw]]s and [[chaingun]]s. They are seen to obey \"Queen\" parasites, much like ants.\n|-\n|M2448 virus (''The Freak Virus'')\n|''[[Crackdown 2]]''\n|The virus called ''M2448'' was created by Catalina Thorne, the leader of Cell, during her time as a medical student working for the Agency. She conducted secret experiments of the virus but was discovered by the Agency and was kicked off the Agency-sponsored medical programme. She was enraged by this and wanted revenge on the Agency because it apparently ruined her life. To get her revenge she offered free vaccinations to the people of Unity Heights (formerly \"The Corridor\"), she was actually vaccinating her victims with the M2448 Virus which tuned them into Freaks. The virus spread across Unity Heights very quickly and soon made its way into the two other boroughs of Pacific City.\n|-\n|Manticore\n|''Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare''\n|A bio-weapon that was devised to target specific genotypes, and would kill anyone not in the [[Atlas Corporation|Atlas]] database. Named after the [[Manticore|Persian mythical creature]].\n|-\n|Marker: DNA sequence\n|''[[Dead Space (series)|Dead Space]]''\n|After the human colony, on planet Aegis discover an alien Marker, that contained complex and powerful DNA sequence, that enabled dead cells to revive. Unfortunately, one of the scientists working on this DNA sequence, dropped the dish containing these engineered cells. The cells, eventually infected one scientists, which then lead to altered mutations of the human body.\n|-\n|Maverick Virus\n|''[[Mega Man X]]''\n|A virus that affects [[Reploids]]. Causes violent insanity and is passed by touch. Victims can sometimes retain their intellect. Combination with the intelligence of the Maverick Hunter Sigma created a variant form called the Sigma Virus, which is airborne. [[Mega Man X]] can be harmed, but not mentally suborned, by this virus. Zero is actually strengthened by exposure, due to his unique status. The Zero Virus is a further evolved, faster version.\n|-\n|MTamashiro-66 Virus\n|''[[Halo (series)|Halo]]''\n|MTamashiro-66 Virus (often shortened to MTa66) as depicted in the ''Halo'' book series is a virus that affects the [[nervous system]] of several species of [[Canidae|canine]].\n|-\n|NE-Alpha Parasite\n|''[[Resident Evil]]'' series\n|The NE-Alpha, or Nemesis Alpha, Parasite has an immunity to the T-virus, and is used to protect the higher brain functions of B.O.W.'s. However, if the B.O.W. is incompatible with the parasite, they die inside of twenty minutes. If they are compatible, however, the parasite acts as a second brain, taking over the functions mof the T-virus ravaged host brain. The host increases in size and strength; and become hardy enough to survive multiple gunshot wounds. The parasite's tentacles become threaded throughout the host's entire body; and can be utilized as a weapon.\n|-\n|NE-Beta Parasite\n|''[[Resident Evil]]'' series\n|The NE-Beta (Nemesis Beta) parasite is an evolved form of the NE-Alpha parasite. The parasite is capable of bonding to all B.O.W.s, from [[zombies]] to T-103 [[super soldier]]s. The parasite has an insectoid appearance, as opposed to the octopous-like form of its predecessor. However, it is prone to decapitating its host, rendering them blind and deaf.\n|-\n|Neuro-Immuno Deficiency Syndrome (N.I.D.S.)\n|<span style=\"display:none\"> Sonic The Hedgehog (series)</span>''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (series)|Sonic The Hedgehog]]''\n|A rare, incurable, and fatal disease. Shortly after Prof. Gerald Robotnik refused G.U.N.'s request for him to discover the secret to immortality, his granddaughter Maria contracted N.I.D.S., causing Gerald to reconsider and begin Project Shadow. The cure was never found, despite Gerald's success at creating the [[Shadow the Hedgehog|ultimate life form]]. Maria later died of a gunshot wound during G.U.N.'s extermination of all involved in the project.\n|-\n|Nova 6\n|''Call of Duty: Black Ops, Call of Duty: Black Ops 3''\n|In Call of Duty: Black Ops, Nova 6 was originally developed by Nazi Germany during the course of World War II by Friedrich Steiner and intended for use in V-2 rockets targeted at major capital cities, such as Washington, D.C. and Moscow. It was later seized, refined, and used by the Soviets, as a component of a grand Soviet sleeper-cell plan by Dragovich. Preventing its release is one of the primary aims of Alex Mason and the CIA in the 1960s.\n|-\n|Nova gas\n|''Call of Duty: Black Ops, Call of Duty: Online''\n|A multiplayer weapon, this is a gas grenade that blurs vision, impairs movement and damages health over time. Using a Tactical Mask makes one immune to it.\n|-\n|Porphyric [[Hemophilia]]\n|<span style=\"display:none\"> Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind, Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</span>''[[The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion]]''\n|Causes [[vampirism]] after an [[incubation period]] of three days. If the player is infected, they can go through a quest to cure the disease, however it is not necessary to be cured to complete the quest.\n|-\n|Pox of LeChuck\n|''[[Tales of Monkey Island]]''\n|The Pox of LeChuck (also named LeChucken Pox in the final episode) is a plague apparent in Tales of Monkey Island that swept across the Caribbean when [[Guybrush]] stabbed [[LeChuck]] with an enchanted voodoo sword at the Rock of Gelato. This caused [[LeChuck]] to be stripped of his voodoo powers, releasing a pandemic that transformed many pirates into green-skinned, foul-mouthed monsters. It also spread to Guybrush's hand, giving it a life of its own (even after being cut off by Morgan LeFlay), as well as infecting his wife, [[Elaine Marley]]. The only known cure is La Esponja Grande, which [[Guybrush]] embarks on a quest to find after speaking with the [[Voodoo Lady]].\n|-\n|Progenitor Virus\n|''[[Resident Evil]]'' series\n|In the [[back-story]] of the series, the Progenitor virus is the primary virus created by the [[Umbrella Corporation]], a mutagen based on [[ebola]], with some of its components extracted from strange flowers that bloom underground, seen in ''[[Resident Evil 5]]''. Successor viruses include the [[T-Virus]], the [[G-Virus]], and [[T-Veronica Virus]].\n|-\n|Phazon Madness\n|''[[Metroid Prime]]''\n|A virus transmitted by being in close proximity to Phazon. The victim's mind is warped so they can no longer tell friend from foe, and exist only to destroy. Phazon Madness is extremely contagious, and it later develops into Phazon Fever, wherein the victim gains an [[obsessive compulsive disorder]] regarding Phazon. Infected victims can utilize Phazon as a weapon and normally can only be killed by Phazon itself.\n|-\n|Pok\u00e9rus\n|''[[Pok\u00e9mon]]''\n|A virus that afflicts Pok\u00e9mon. Though it is incurable, it has no negative effects, and is in fact helpful. Pok\u00e9mon afflicted gain double effort values in battle. The Pok\u00e9mon retains this ability even after its contagious period of 48 hours has passed. Transmission is by proximity in a party, and the 48-hour \"clock\" is stopped by placing the Pok\u00e9mon into a PC.\n|-\n|Radical-6\n|''[[Zero Escape: Virtue's Last Reward]]''\n|Radical-6 was a virus developed by the apocalyptic cult \"Free the Soul\" to destroy human civilization.  A highly infectious virus, it causes the human brain to experience time at a 40% slower rate, and eventually drives its victims to suicide. The global pandemic eventually leads to a desperate (and hinted to be Radical-6 induced) plan to detonate 18 anti-matter generators simultaneously, initiating a [[nuclear winter]].\n|-\n|Roboenza\n|''[[Mega Man 10]]''\n|A virus that affects humanoid [[robots]], causing [[flu]]-like symptoms and eventually homicidal tendencies. Created and subsequently cured by [[Dr. Wily]]. Some theories hold that it is related to the Evil Energy from ''[[Mega Man 8]]'' and the Maverick Virus from the ''[[Mega Man X]]'' series\n|-\n|Rotten World Gas\n|''[[Lollipop Chainsaw]]''\n|A poisonous gas from the Rotten World (Hell) which leaks through interdimensional cracks caused by the Necromancer Swan when he cracks open a gate between Earth and Rotten World. This gas leaks through the cracks and kills everybody who inhales it within minutes, shortly reanimating them as psychotic zombies within a short while. It appears the gas is transmittable through bites, and therefore contagious. In hallucinations, the gas is also shown to affect animals.\n|-\n|Rustlung/Lambency\n|''[[Gears of War]]'' series\n|A fictional underground substance known as Imulsion was refined by the humans of Sera and used as a limitless fuel source. However, unknown to the humans at the time, Imulsion was a liquid fungal parasite that invades the host through spores in the Imulsion fumes. Miners of Imulsion and their families became sick with Imulsion-poisoning which would be called Rustlung, a pneumonia-like condition that expels rust-colored phlegm. The government attempted to hide and resolve the issue by imprisoning the children sick with Rustlung in the New Hope Research Facility in order to cure the disease. However, the scientist in charge, Dr. Niles Samson, went mad and genetically altered the children with the DNA of indigenous creatures from underground, resulting in the creation of the Locust Horde, the main enemy species in the game. The government learned of these unethical experiments and Dr. Niles Samson took them underground to continue his work. While underground, Rustlung, later evolving into Lambency in which the host becomes possessed by the Imulsion, began to overrun the Locust Horde, forcing them to emerge on the surface and wage war against humanity in order to escape the Lambent. All Lambent inherit Imuslion's qualities: golden glow in the dark and explosive properties. Rustlung continued to infect the human population, especially during the war against the Locust Horde, in which the Imulsion evaporated and polluted the surface with fumes due to bombing the underground. After the humans managed to flood the underground to kill both the Locust and Lambent, the seawater rose the Imulsion into the soil and caused a pandemic to occur, infecting both Locust and Humans with Lambency. Both Rustlung and Lambency are destroyed, however, when Professor Adam Fenix activates an Imulsion Countermeasure, which uses targeted levels of radiation to kill cells with Imulsion. All Imulsion was destroyed and organisms that were infected with Imulsion were killed. \n|-\n|Scurge\n|''[[Scurge: Hive]]''\n|A parasite that can infect biological, technological, or coherent energy systems. It takes about one minute to overwhelm the special filters designed to ward off its infection.\n|-\n|\"Green Flu\" (Previously Unknown)\n|''[[Left 4 Dead (series)|Left 4 Dead]],''<br />''[[Payday: The Heist|Payday The Heist: No Mercy]]''\n|The Green Flu, commonly referred to simply as The Infection, has caused most humans who come in contact with it to change into homicidal, zombie-like beings. Anyone can catch it, but there are few out there who [[Asymptomatic carrier|show no symptoms of the virus]]. They can, however, spread it to whoever comes in contact with them. These carriers seldom realize they are spreading the virus, leaving a path of destruction in their wake.\n|-\n|The Plague\n|''[[Mass Effect 2]]''\n|The Plague is a virus possibly created by the [[Races of the Mass Effect universe#Collectors|Collectors]] which infects all species except [[humans]] and [[Races of the Mass Effect universe#Vorcha|vorcha]], the latter being resistant to any infection, and the former being immediately scapegoated for the spread of the plague and hunted down by local gangs. It causes horrible sores, a bad cough and coughing up blood, caused by rapid mutations to the respiratory systems. It was being spread through the ventilation system of the slums of Omega by the vorcha under orders of the Collectors but was stopped by [[Characters of the Mass Effect universe#Commander Shepard|Shepard]] and doctor [[Mordin Solus]], since Omega has no authorities whatsoever and the affected area was simply sealed until everyone would die.\n|-\n|The Plague of Undeath\n|''[[Warcraft III]]''\n|The Plague is responsible for the entire Undead race. It can re-animate dead creatures with a reasonable degree of sentience. However, the creature is usually dominated by the undead command structure, but they can escape from the tyranny of undeath. It also causes the soil beneath and around Undead structures to change into a substance known as Blight, which is poisonous to most plants.\n|-\n|The Rat Plague\n|''[[Dishonored]]''\n|The Rat Plague killed almost half of the population of the city of Dunwall, the fictional city from the game Dishonored. Victims of the rat plague can cure themselves via use of Sokolov's Health Elixir. Once blood comes from the Nose or Eyes there is no way to be cured. It is also known as the doom of Pandyssia.\n|-\n|Rosalia Virus\n|''[[Trauma Team]]''\n|A variation of viral hemorrhagic fever, capable of killing patients in days. The virus was originally found in the blood of Rosalia Rosselini by Cumberland College professor Albert Sartre. Sartre and his son attempted to use the virus to cure all disease, but instead found that it could not be used for positive means. An outbreak of the virus occurred, resulting in the Cumberland College Incident, where Sartre and Rosalia escaped to Mexico, and his son lost all memory of the incident, but was arrested and sentenced to 250 years of imprisonment under the ID \"CR-S01\". However, Sartre was inflicted with the virus, causing him to fall to insanity, killing Rosalia. Rosalia's blood splattered onto nearby flowers, which monarch butterflies fed upon, acting as vectors that caused a second outbreak. A variation of the Rosalia virus was encountered once, when one of the Rosalia patients, Naomi Kimishima, also had a pre-existing incurable genetic disease (thought to be related to GUILT). Interactions between the genetic disease and Rosalia gave birth to a \"Twisted Rosalia\" strain, which only one case was known to be documented.\n|-\n|Scorched Plague\n|''[[Fallout 76]]''\n|A plague caused by Scorchbeasts, giant bat-like mutants created by the Enclave in 2083. Symptoms can include a loss of higher brain function, growths of Ultracite protruding from the victim's skin, and a connection to the Scorchbeast Hive Mind. Victims of the plague go through a skin transformation that goes from a charred, blackened appearance to red lesions and the appearance of being flayed alive. Scorched also develop cataracts in the eyes and experience complete hair loss. The plague wipes out most of the residents of West Virginia, save for the player characters/Vault 76 inhabitants. Additionally, all Scorched victims have a set lifespan, at the end of which they stay in a single position until their bodies petrify from the inside out. They retain enough mental faculties to operate smaller firearms and various melee weapons, as well as wear armor for protection. The Scorched are hostile toward anything that they perceive as a threat.\n|-\n|SCP-610\n| [[SCP Foundation]]\n|A highly infectious skin disease which was first reported by the Russian government in the 1970s. The disease begins as a normal skin disease which irritates the infected, causing itching and bad skin. But then searing temperatures increase the infection and spread it through the body, causing skin to rot and mutate. Eventually the victim is covered from head to toe in infectious sores. The victim is then declared clinically dead and reanimates after a while, and will attempt to infect anyone else they encounter. The Foundation has been trying to contain this disease, but they may be unsuccessful because of its fast contagion spread.\n|-\n|Skull shivers\n|''[[Borderlands (video game)|Borderlands]]''\n|\n|-\n|Stigma\n|''[[Trauma Center: New Blood]]''\n|A virus accidentally created by Markus Vaughn and Lloyd Wilkens. It is later used as a bioterror weapon by the group Parnassus. It comes in six strains, named after body parts it resembles or attacks (Cheir, Soma, Ops, Onyx, Brachion, Cardia). Unlike other pathogens, which store their genetic information in DNA, Stigma stores its genetic information in a film-like structure making it unique among pathogens. Due to the fact that Stigma originated from a lab rat with Culurium-based synthetic blood, a newly discovered mineral from the country of Culuruma, taking control of the mines that contain the mineral is necessary for the mass production of Stigma.\n|-\n|Syphon Filter\n|''[[Syphon Filter (series)|Syphon Filter series]]''\n|A bio-weapon that can be genetically programmable to terminate specific genotypes, killing only intended victims while leaving non-targeted parties alive''.'' Because it binds with each host's specific DNA, it does not possess a universal vaccine, and in order to cure it, one must know the specific genetic lock and key for each strain of the disease.\n|-\n|T-Abyss Virus\n|''[[Resident Evil]]'' series\n|A variant of the T-Virus, designed by FBC CEO Morgan Lansdale to show the world the dangers of bio-weapons and increase his own personal power through use of the 'Veltro' terrorist group. The virus crates zombies and BOWs who are strongly linked with water, and have numerous aquatic features such as tentacles and crab-like shells. It is encountered in the game when 'Veltro' threaten to infect the world's oceans, hoping to exact revenge for the loss of much of their forces during the bio-terrorist attack on the floating techno-utopia Terragrigia. It is encountered during exploration of three research vessals, where it has transformed the crew and several sea creatures into zombies, mutants and Tyrants.\n|-\n|T-Veronica Virus\n|''[[Resident Evil]]'' series\n|A powerful strain of the Progenitor Virus, created by combining it with a rare [[retrovirus]] found in the genetic make-up of ant queens, discovered by unstable scientific genius Alexia Ashford, the result of an advanced cloning experiment. It is encountered in ''[[Resident Evil Code: Veronica|Code: Veronica]]'', when it is being used by Alexia Ashford in her attempt to take control of the world. She experiments on her father, then on herself; her father is transformed into a terrifying monster, while she, going into hibernation after giving herself a dose of the Virus, manages to gain control over it and retain her personality and intelligence. She eventually becomes a dragonfly-like creature who has to be killed by [[Chris Redfield]]. It appears again in the 'Operation Javier' section of ''[[Resident Evil: Darkside Chronicles|Darkside Chronicles]]'', where it is being used by Javier Hidalgo to cure his daughter Manuela of an inherited illness. He also tried to cure his wife, but the virus overwhelmed her and turned her into a mutant. Manuela uses her developing powers (similar to Alexia Ashford's abilities before transforming into her insect form) to defeat the mutated Javier, and is then evacuated by [[Leon S. Kennedy|Leon Kennedy]] and [[Jack Krauser]]. If Manuela survives at the end of the game, it is said that she is cared for by the US government, but her ultimate fate is left unknown.\n|-{{anchor|T-Virus}}\n|T-Virus (Tyrant virus)\n|''[[Resident Evil]]'' series\n|A highly contagious virus, spread mostly through liquids such as bodily fluids and water, that causes cellular [[necrosis]] in humans and other animals, turning them into zombie-like creatures who are difficult to kill. It can easily mutate into other strains, some of which have mutagenic effects on the host. In insects or amphibians, the resulting mutation often involves increased aggressiveness, increased size, and (almost always) the development of poisonous traits. In mammals, the results include aggressiveness, physiological changes of varying degrees, and an extremely increased evolutionary rate. However, it is shown that some humans can bond with the T-Virus and its variants and gain heightened speed, strength and strange powers while retaining their personalities, as in the case of [[Albert Wesker]] and [[Alexia Ashford]]. Variants include the [[Nemesis (Resident Evil)|NE-T virus]], along with many others.\n|-\n|Technocyte Virus (The Infestation)\n|''[[Warframe]]''\n|The Technocyte virus mutates both flesh and metal alike. It disfigures and dismembers anybody it infects, turning them into a raging and mindless creature. These infected entities and the virus itself make up a faction known as the \"Infestation.\" Notable infested entities include Lephantis, Jordas Golem, and Phorid. The virus itself can take over something as insignificant as a simple drone to an entire Corpus Obelisk. \n|-\n|Tiberium poisoning\n|''[[Command & Conquer]]''\n|Tiberium crystals start to grow on a person's skin. These skin crystals eventually force their way through the persons vital organs, killing them. If the infestation is in a certain proportion, the victim mutates into a living bag of rotten skin and organs, called a visceroid.\n|-\n|Turbo Cancer\n|''[[Borderlands (video game)|Borderlands]]''\n|-\n|Unicornitis\n|''[[Octodad: Dadliest Catch]]''\n|A disease made up during a story told by Tommy and Stacy in the bonus episode \"Medical Mess\". Symptoms include a bright pink unicorn horn magically sprouting from the forehead, and the ability to fly. The only known cure is to purchase and use a set of jet-skis. Notable victims include Patient 203 and Octodad.\n|-\n|Uroboros\n|''[[Resident Evil]]'' series\n|An advanced strain of the Progenitor virus, the Uroboros virus was created by Albert Wesker, with inadvertent help from Jill Valentine. Exposure to Uroboros can lead to one of two things\u2014forced evolution via DNA integration, leading to extremely heightened abilities, or rejection via the virus, leading to the parasitic nature taking over and forming a mass of black, leech-like pustules, which can grow in size if exposed to more organic matters. The only individual known to survive the process was Albert Wesker, which was more than likely due to the fact of his previous exposure to the T-virus. Other beings that took positive mutations from the Uroboros virus include the Reapers; cockroaches exposed accidentally to the virus, who then in turn grew largely in size, gained armour-like carapaces and scythe-like appendages, explaining the name.\n|-\n|Wailing Death\n|''[[Neverwinter Nights]]''\n|A bubonic-like plague that infects almost the entire city of Neverwinter. Thought to be just a natural plague, it is later discovered that it was magically created and unleashed upon the city.\n|-\n|X-2 Virus\n|''[[BattleTanx]]'', ''[[BattleTanx: Global Assault]]''\n|An extremely deadly virus released in 2001 and further researched in 2006 that killed 99.9% of the world's human female population that did not possess a special psychic ability known as 'The Edge'.  Those that were spared were treated with the utmost respect, authority, and loyalty, thereby earning their title of 'Queenlord'.\n|-\n|Yellow Death\n|''[[Ben Croshaw#1213 series|1213]]''\n|A deadly virus which contaminated the entire planet Earth and certain parts of the Tessa Life Orbital. Humans are killed in short time upon infection, but cloned humans are transformed into killer zombies. When 0916 got a large dosage of the virus he mutated into a yellow, four-armed monster with two retractable spines and tentacles. 1213 however was unaffected by the virus due to a successful [[Immunization]] to the virus.\n|-\n|Twin Fever\n|''[[Metroid Prime]]''\n|A Virus native to Twin Tabula causing double vision. When the twin sight fades, the victim is near death.\n|-\n|''Kuru'' {{clarify|date=July 2015}}\n|''[[Dead Island]], [[Dead Island: Riptide|Dead Island Riptide]]'', ''[[Dead Island 2]]''\n| Is a sub-type version of Kuru which later actually revealing is neuro-genetically engineered version of Kuru that infected islands to the Papua New Guinea region. It is widely passed among the local tribes and is believed to be the cause of the zombie outbreak. Doctor West needs a non-mutated strain of this disease to work on a cure. Doctor West also believes that people with O Negative blood are unsusceptible to the infection\n|-\n|Tuurngait Virus\n|''[[Penumbra: Black Plague]]''\n|The Tuurngait Virus is a disease that can affect humans and animals, it was later discovered by the Archaic led by Philip's father Howard LaFresque and his crew members in Greenland. It was later tested and found out that one of its effects is mutation.\n|}\n\n== In role playing games ==\n<!-- PLEASE NOTE: Only additions of nonexistent, named medical conditions which appear in fiction where they have a major plot or thematic importance are welcome, if unsure ask on the talk page first-->\n<!-- Please do [[wikilink]] to the relevant *medical* concepts -->\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Name\n!Source\n!Symptoms\n|-\n|Goblin Fever\n|''[[Dungeon Adventures]] #46'', \"Goblin Fever\"\n|This disease is a relatively harmless ailment to goblins, orcs, and similar creatures, but it is rare. To humans, it is much deadlier. Having a long incubation period and being highly contagious, an outbreak can start before the first case is even detected. The disease causes deterioration of the central nervous system, causing forgetfulness and rapid mood swings, the victim often becoming violent, depressed, or even suicidal, eventually lapsing into a coma before dying.\n|-\n|Free League Plague\n|''[[Planescape]]''\n|A plague created by the Lady of Pain to keep the swelling numbers of the Free League in check, which grew to an overwhelming size after a conflict called the Great Upheaval amongst the factions, where the Lady of Pain decreed that there could only be fifteen Factions in Sigil at one time. Very little is known about this disease, but any member of the Free League stood a chance of becoming infected with it simply by entering Sigil.\n|-\n|Magical Diseases\n|''[[Dungeons and Dragons]]''\n|The setting has several of varying degrees of lethality, most of them affecting one or more Ability Scores. The most well known are Devil Chills, Cackle Fever, Filth Fever, Mummy Rot, and Slimy Doom.\n|-\n|Slarecian Language Virus\n|''[[Scarred Lands]]''\n|This odd affliction can infect anyone who tries to use magic or even rudimentary means to decipher the language of the Slarecian, an extinct species of evil sorcerers, if the work they are trying to decipher has this specific taint. An infected victim's language is changed to that of the Slarecians (which is gibberish to most natives of Scarn), meaning he can only understand or be understood by another infected victim, and all written language other than Slarecian makes no sense to him. Victims do not realize what has happened to them, as what they say sounds clear to them. The disease is incredibly contagious; anyone who listens to an infected victim risks also becoming infected. \n|-\n|Ravenloft Viruses\n|''[[Ravenloft]] Monstrous Compendium Appendix III: Creatures of Darkness''\n|These six magical diseases were created by an evil wizard who was killed by his six sons, who each became the first carrier of one of them: Combustion (the victim experiences a horrible fever and eventually bursts into flames), Crystal (the victim's blood crystallizes from within), Petrification (the victim gradually turns to stone) Phobia (the victim becomes terrified of everything), Psionic (the victim rapidly gains intelligence and psionic powers until their head explodes) and Shadow (the victim eventually fades into darkness). \n|-\n|Vile Diseases\n|''[[Book of Vile Darkness]]''\n|The book mentions seventeen diseases of varying lethality caused by evil magic or exposure to focal points of incredible evil. The most notorious ones are Faceless Hate (causes the victim's face to vanish, and drives him to a violent, insane rage), Life Blindness (the victim is unable to see, hear, or otherwise perceive any other living thing, and is often driven mad from isolation and loneliness), and Vile Rigidity (the victim becomes stronger and tougher, but eventually, their skin hardens, until they can't move and suffocates).\n|-\n|Knahaten Flu\n|''[[The Elder Scrolls]]''\n|The Knahaten Flu (also known as the Knahaten Plague) was one of the deadliest diseases to infect the populace of Tamriel, lasting for 43 years. Though exactly how the disease was introduced is unknown, it started in the swamps of Black Marsh. Argonians, the denizens of Black Marsh, were immune to the disease, leading to speculation about its source, but it did not take long for it to sweep through the rest of the continent. There is no definitive death toll of the disease. However, the Flu almost completely destroyed the non-Argonian population of Black Marsh, and killed vast swathes of the population of Tamriel. The exact method of transmission is unclear. Early symptoms of the Flu include \"general malaise, loss of appetite, and fatigue,\" followed shortly by aching muscles, sharp pain in the shoulders, chills, and watering eyes. Late-stage symptoms include wracking cough, high fever, and blood flowing out of the nose, eyes and eventually the mouth. Victims rarely survived longer than a few days.\n|-\n|Virally-Induced Toxic Allergy Syndrome (VITAS)\n|''[[Shadowrun]]''\n|Caused by a highly lethal and communicable airborne virus, VITAS is the disease responsible for many of the changes that led to what became the Sixth World in the Shadowrun universe, having killed a quarter of the world's population after its outbreak in 2011. A second strain (VITAS II) broke out in the 2020s, killing an additional 10%. Symptoms begin 12 hours after infection and begin with symptoms similar to influenza before developing into severe anaphylaxis leading to death usually by the airways swelling shut. Though treatable with modern drugs, at the initial outbreak of VITAS over 75% of the world's population became infected before a cure was discovered.\n|-\n|Human-Metahuman Vampiric Virus (HMHVV)\n|''[[Shadowrun]]''\n|A mutagenic retrovirus that achieves its full virulence and power only in a magic-rich environment\u2014such as post-Awakening Earth. The virus itself has existed throughout history and even expressed in very rare instances during the relatively magic-poor Fifth World. When a metahuman\u2019s immune system fails to stave off infection, the virus begins to systematically re-shape their auras and genetic code\u2014transforming them into forms reminiscent of the night-stalking monsters of legend. The specific form that the subject takes is dependent on their original genetic form and the strain of the virus they contract.\n|-\n|White Fever\n|''[[Ravenloft]]''\n|A disease that is usually unique to the Core Domain of Valachan. Symptoms include weakness, exhaustion, chills, and loss of strength. Magical remedies cannot cure it, but conventional medicine can hasten recovery. In truth, \"white fever\" is one of many hoaxes orchestrated by Valachan's ruler, Baron Urik von Kharkov, in order to hide his true nature from his subjects. The illness is actually caused by the vampiric feeding of the Baron and his servants.\n|-\n|Blorbs\n|''[[Mario & Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story]]''\n|A mysterious disease that causes a toad to grow large and round renedering them mostly immobile and can make roll uncontrollably.\n|-\n|Green Poison (Dollar Flu)\n|''[[Tom Clancy's The Division]]''\n|A bio-weapon created by Dr Gordon Amherst, as a mean of controlling population. With a strain of [[Dengue]], [[Smallpox]], [[Swineflu]], [[H1N1]], [[Ebola]], [[Hantavirus]] and [[Marburg Virus]]. Comparing to the original smallpox virus, not only does it incubates faster, it is also infectious during its incubation period. Due to its rapid mutation, it is extremely difficult for antibodies and drugs to identify the virus and exterminate them as well as creating vaccine to this disease.\n|}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* '' Disease in Fiction.

Martin</span>''[[Wild Cards]]''<br /> by [[George R. R. Martin]]\n|The Black Trump virus is a variant of Xenovirus Takis-B. Rather than a cure, this retrovirus was designed to kill aces, jokers, latents, and wild card carriers. [[Dr. Tachyon]]'s original Trump virus was designed to turn wild carders back into nats (a slang term for naturals), those who do not carry Xenovirus Takis-A in their system.\n|-\n|Bloodfire\n|''[[Blood Nation]]''\n|A virus that gestated in [[Gray wolf|wolves]] two thousand years ago. The first to be infected was [[Genghis Khan]]. It causes the symptoms usually associated with [[vampirism]], [[photosensitivity]] and invincibility. The entire nation of Russia is infected, except for a few [[feral]] children. The virus can cause extreme [[mutation]], for example the snake's tail present in the Khan's head scientist.\n|-\n|[[Brainpox]] \"Cobra\"\n|''[[The Cobra Event]]''\n|A genetically engineered [[recombinant virus]] made from the [[nuclear polyhedrosis virus]], the [[rhinovirus]], and [[smallpox]].

Created as a biological weapon codenamed Blue. Causes a lethally high fever and is highly contagious. It is deadly because as the body fights off the disease, it mutates into different strains of influenza, making [[Immunity (medical)|immunity]] next to impossible.\n|-\n|Clone-Killing Nanovirus\n|''[[Star Wars Republic Commando: Hard Contact]]''<br />by [[Karen Traviss]]\n|A nanovirus developed by the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems]] designed specifically to kill the [[cloning|clones]] of Jango Fett. Its creator, Ovolot Qail Uthan, is captured by Republic Commandos before her research is complete, however. In later books in the series, it is revealed (though not to any of the main characters, but to the reader through both Palpatine's and Dr. Uthan's private journals), [[Chancellor Palpatine]] secretly chooses not to completely destroy all evidence or research of the virus, but rather opts to hold onto it as a back-up plan, should the clone army ever be turned against him.\n|-\n|Collins' Syndrome\n|''[[The Legend of Deathwalker]]'' by [[David Gemmell]]\n|A mutating disease that often starts with pain and sensitivity in the victims nipples, then forms a temporary tumor in the brain as it feeds upon the genetic material of the brain cells, sapping away the victims critical thinking skills and intelligence, once it reaches its critical density, the tumor disbands into the bloodstream, the virus going into a form of hibernation, leaving its victim in a state of near absolute uselessness.  Once the virus detects that it has entered a new host due to differences in protein markers of the victims cells, the process begins again.\n|-\n|Gray brittle death\n|''[[The Colour Out of Space]]'' by [[H. P. Lovecraft]]\n|A disease caused by infection with an alien entity called \"[[Colour out of space (species)|The colour]]\" by characters in the story, the disease affects anything living, including plants, insects, livestock, wild animals, and humans. Symptoms in plants include either stunting or growing abnormally large with lots of tasteless fruit and growing abnormally-shaped flowers and leaves followed by glowing in the dark with an indescribable color and finally losing their leaves and crumbling to gray dust. Insects become strangely bloated and oddly shaped before crumbling into grey dust. Livestock such as hogs grow abnormally large with tasteless meat before wasting away and crumbling to grey dust, while cattle and horses exhibit strange behavior followed by crumbling into a grey powder. In some of the wild animals, the disease causes animals to leave \"strange footprints in the snow\" that are recognizable as known animals but are off in anatomy and behavior, and rabbits have abnormally long strides. In humans, the disease causes its victims to slowly go insane and see things that are not there, talk incoherently, suffer memory loss followed by walking on all fours. The victim then begins glowing in the dark with an indescribable color and becoming increasingly weak and thin before crumbling to grey dust.\nHuman victims describe \"being drained of something\" or \"having the life sucked out\".\n|-\n|[[Cooties]]\n|Various\n|A term used by children in the United States, with varied meaning. \"Cooties\" generally refers to an invisible germ, bug, or microscopic monster, transferred by skin to skin contact, usually with a member of the opposite sex.<ref>{{citation | author = Sue Samuelson | title = The Cooties Complex | volume = 39 | date = July 1980 | pages = 198\u2013210 | publisher = Western States Folklore Society | jstor = 1499801 | journal = Western Folklore | issue = 3 }}</ref>\n|-\n| Curse of the Warmbloods\n| ''[[The Underland Chronicles]]'' by [[Suzanne Collins]]\n| A disease created by Doctor Neveeve in the city of Regalia. She gave the disease to fleas, which instead of getting infected, spread the disease around warm-blooded creatures, including people. Symptoms include purple blemishes, coughing, choking, and a swelled tongue. The cure was originally believed to be a plant named starshade, though the true cure was made in Regalia.\n|-\n|[[Dar-Kosis]]\n|''[[Gor]]''<br />by [[John Norman]]\n|Dar-kosis is a virulent, horrible, wasting disease and is similar in many ways to leprosy. It is taught by the Initiates (who claim to be the voice of the Priest-Kings of Gor) that Dar-Kosis is a holy disease.\n|-\n|Death Stench\n|''[[Gyo]]'' by [[Junji Ito]]\n|A virus designed by the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] during WWII, it was designed to be paired up with mechanical walking machines to carry infected hosts further towards enemies to be sickened. The Death Stench was let loose on Japan when the ship carrying the prototypes was destroyed by allied aircraft; the virus then began multiplying, synthesising new walking machines by harvesting iron from shipwrecks until the present day, when large quantities of infected sea life began invading the [[Kanto region]]. The Death Stench disease causes its hosts - which can range from fish to humans and other large mammals - to visibly bloat, and begin producing large quantities of gas containing the virus; when attached to a walking machine, this gas powers the machine's legs, which will remain active until its victim decays away and is no longer able to produce enough gas to make the machine move. It appears that the virus is airborne, although it can also be contracted via being attached to a vacant walking machine; amputating a limb that has become attached to a smaller walking machine is the only way to escape, and even then the machine will still use the limb as a 'power source'.\n|-\n|[[Demon Pox]]\n|''[[The Infernal Devices]]''<br />by [[Cassandra Clare]]\n|Demon pox, also known as astriola, is a rare but debilitating disease that affects Shadowhunters and is caused by sexual contact with demons.\nMundanes are immune to the disease, as demon pox is assumed to be caused by the interaction of demon poisons with the angelic nature of Shadowhunters.\n|-\n|[[Descolada]]\n|''[[Speaker for the Dead]]''<br />by [[Orson Scott Card]]\n|A quasi-conscious self-modifying organism capable of infecting any form of life. \"Descolada\" is also the Portuguese word for \"unglued\". In the context of the book, this refers to the Descolada virus's effects: it breaks the link of the [[DNA double helix]] (ungluing it) and induces mutations.\n|-\n|Despotellis\n|''[[Green Lantern Corps]]''\n| A sentient virus and a member of the Sinestro Corps. It could create non-sentient duplicates of itself creating a plague capable of killing infected victims within minutes, and can also destroy these duplicates, leaving no trace of their presence. Among the victims of its plague was [[Kyle Rayner]]'s mother.\n|-\n|Diseasemaker's Croup\n|''[[Fragile Things]]'' by [[Neil Gaiman]]\n|A disorder 'afflicting those who habitually and pathologically catalogue and construct diseases.' It is characterized by increasingly nonsensical speech and writing patterns and an obsessive insistence on trying to repeat previous statements out of context.\n|-\n|[[Dragon Pox]]\n|''[[Harry Potter|The Harry Potter Series]]''<br />by [[J.K. Rowling]]\n|Dragon pox is a potentially fatal contagious disease that occurs in wizards and witches. Its symptoms are presumably similar to Muggle illnesses like smallpox and chicken pox. However, in addition to leaving the victim's skin pockmarked, dragon pox causes a lasting greenish tinge. Simpler cases present with a green-and-purple rash between the toes and sparks coming out of the nostrils when the patient sneezes. Elderly patients are apparently more susceptible to dragon pox than younger ones. Gunhilda of Gorsemoor developed a cure for dragon pox, but the disease has not been completely eradicated, as is evidenced by the fact that it is still treated by the Magical Bugs ward at St. Mungo's Hospital.\n|-\n|Dryditch Fever\n|''[[Salamandastron]]''<br /> by [[Brian Jacques]]\n|A deadly disease causing weakness, hot flashes, chills, and dizziness. The victim is usually bedridden until eventual death. The only known cure are Flowers of Icetor boiled in spring water.\n|-\n|DX\n|''[[The Lost World (Crichton novel)|The Lost World]]''<br />by [[Michael Crichton]]\n|An unknown [[prion]] dubbed \"DX\" by scientists on Isla Sorna. It is similar to [[mad cow disease]] and was the result of feeding ground-up sheep to carnivorous dinosaurs. DX increased the mortality rate of newborn dinosaurs and is eventually fatal to adult dinosaurs. In order to combat DX, InGen scientists released animals into the wild of Isla Sorna. The prion initially infected carnivorous dinosaurs such as [[velociraptor]]s and [[procompsognathus]], which would then spread the disease to herbivores such as [[apatosaurus]], and the apatosaur carcasses would be eaten by compys, which would then spread the disease to other carcasses, and the cycle would repeat. Ian Malcolm said at the end of the novel that, because of the imbalance of carnivores and herbivores due to DX, the dinosaurs were doomed to die out.\n|-\n|Ebola Gulf A\n|[[DC Comics]]\n|Also known as \"the Clench\", due to the victims clenching their stomachs, Ebola Gulf is an evolved form of the [[Ebola|ebola virus]] created by the terrorist mastermind [[Ra's al Ghul]] after he consulted the ''Wheel of Plagues.''\n|- id=\"Fire-Us\"\n|Fire-Us (Sounds like \"Virus\")\n|[[Jennifer Armstrong#Fire-Us Trilogy|Fire-Us series]]\n|A viral infection that infects extremely fast and only infects those that produce sex hormones (i.e. those after puberty and women before menopause) or are taking medicine that includes similar hormones. It was released by the President of the United States of America to start the world over, killing almost all adults within 2 weeks. As a result, children were left to fend for themselves, most of whom failed. Once all the targets of the virus were gone, it died out.\n|-\n|The Flare (virus VC321xb47)\n|''[[The Maze Runner (series)|The Maze Runner]]''\n|A highly contagious virus that infects the brain of its host, turning them into crazed blood-thirsty cannibals (essentially zombies) that are called Cranks. Less than 1% of the population is immune to the virus, and are called Munies. There is no cure for The Flare, but many wealthy people slow down the onslaught of the symptoms with an illegal drug called The Bliss, which slows down their brain activity. It was released by the governments of the world to help control overpopulation after the Sun Flares, but it eventually killed most of the people in the world.\n|-\n|Foul-Drought\n|<span style=\"display:none\">Heir of Mistmantle by M.

Animals who have it will have pain, blurry sight and some will eventually die.\n|-\n|<span style=\"display:none\">Gray Death</span>The Gray Death\n|[[Gail Carson Levine]]'s ''[[The Two Princesses of Bamarre]]''\n|Disease created from the noxious gas from the defeated dragon Yune's stomach. It comes on with no warning and is not contagious. There are three stages of the disease. The first stage is the weakness, and it can last anywhere from a week to six months.

It is first introduced in Stannis Baratheon's daughter Shireen. When it infects children, greyscale generally leaves children malformed and disabled but alive. However, in ''[[A Dance with Dragons]]'', it is revealed to be generally fatal to adults. The disease is contracted by touch and slowly turns the skin (small patches in children and the entire body in adults) of the victim to into a gray, stone-like form. It is said that the disease also drives its adult victims insane.\n|-\n|Hanahaki Disease, or Hanahaki Byou\n|Japanese, Korean, and Chinese pop band, anime, and manga fandoms\n|Hanahaki Disease (\u82b1\u5410\u304d\u75c5 (Japanese); \ud558\ub098\ud558\ud0a4\ubcd1 (Korean); \u82b1\u5410\u75c5 (Chinese)) is a fictional disease where the victim of unrequited or one-sided love begins to vomit or cough up the petals and flowers of a flowering plant growing in their lungs, which will eventually grow large enough to render breathing impossible if left untreated.

Those infected (in the novel consisting of the entire town of Macondo) feel no tiredness or sleepiness whatsoever and hence can work all day and night. However, as time advances, those infected begin to [[amnesia|lose all their memories]] and [[epistemology|knowledge of the world]]; ultimately leaving them in a state in which they have forgotten the names and uses of all things and their own identities.

The exact unleashers are unknown, but are implied to be a terrorist group due to numerous theories in the novel. The virus is implied to have been released just after [[September 11th, 2001|September 11th]], and lain dormant in cell phones ever since. Once the right signal is transmitted and leaked into incoming phone calls, the caller's brain cells immediately disintegrate and they are unable to recognize friend from foe; they are even unable to recognize other people infected with the virus. Inevitably, the infected callers become psychotic and start killing each other, the chaos of which lasts approximately two days before the infected callers have become \"stable\" enough to cooperate and recognize each other.\n|-\n|Ratititis\n|[[Boy (book)|Roald Dahl's Boy]]\n|A fictional disease invented by [[Roald Dahl]]'s friend Thwaites during their schooldays in [[Llandaff]]. Thwaites made this up to amuse Roald and the other friends, but he says his dad told him about the disease, which is apparently contracted from eating [[liquorice|liquorice bootlaces]]. Thwaites says that the bootlaces actually have rat's blood rather than licquorice, and they are done this way by rat-catchers bringing their rats to the sweet factory where they pound the rats into a paste, then mash it up to form licquorice bootlaces. Thwaites told Roald and his friends never to eat them, because if they did, a rat's tail would burst out of their buttocks and their teeth would turn into fangs.

The virus attaches itself to a victim's DNA, enabling the host body to instinctively rewrite their own genetic code. Typically, a host relies upon primitive instinct when affecting such a change, rendering them capable of shapeshifting into a wide variety of forms (usually animals). Sakutia victims suffer from one other noticeable side effect: their hair and skin turn permanently green in hue. \n|-\n|Salt Plague\n|Spiritwalker Trilogy<br />by [[Kate Elliott]]\n|Disease that feeds on the salt in its host's body.

Vedet involves personality disorders and dementia; sevai usually leads to blindness and other sensory loss, along with degeneration of muscle control. Both diseases are painful, crippling, incurable, and fatal. Severity of onset and the length of the course of the illness vary: major damage leads to non-viability in the womb (with a quarter of all children in the Valley being stillborn due to sevai); minor damage might not show up until old age and lead to death in a decade.\n|-\n|Shame\n|''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]''<br />by [[Douglas Adams]]\n|Mentioned as being \"still a terminal disease in some parts of the Galaxy,\" this disease seems rife amongst the population of Betelgeuse 5, the fifth planet of the sun [[Betelgeuse]].

Centuries later, Darth Scabrous successfully completed Drear's unfinished work, but accidentally modified it into a semi-sentient hive mind that creates zombies. The Sith academy on Odacin-Fauster was wiped out by the plague. Thousands of years later, Darth Vader commissioned the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Empire]]'s bioweapons division to recreate the virus. Upon completion, the virus was loaded onto the Star Destroyer ''Vector'' for transport to a testing site. En route, the tanks leaked and the Destroyer's crew was zombified. The virus is characterized by grey goo.\n|-\n|Snow Crash\n|''[[Snow Crash]]''<br />by [[Neal Stephenson]]\n|A dangerous drug that is both a [[computer virus]] capable of infecting the brains of unwary hackers in the Metaverse and a mind-altering virus distributed by a network of [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal churches]] via its infrastructure and belief system.

Solanum symptoms include [[dementia]], [[paralysis]] in the extremities, and discoloration of the wound, which increase as the virus replicates itself. The virus is centered on the brain, and destroys the cells of the brain and replaces them with the virus. In doing so, the infected victims are declared clinically dead. The virus takes around sixteen hours to replicate, although it varies from individual to individual. Once Solanum has fully replicated, the victim awakes from the coma, with an unquenchable desire for [[cannibalism|human flesh]]. The victim also exhibits typical zombie-like behavior such as psychotic behavior and mindless rage, and can only be killed by destruction of the brain.\n|-\n|Space plague\n|[[Alisa Selezneva]] books<br />by [[Kir Bulychov]]\n|A lethal, extremely contagious virus responsible for destroying numerous inhabited planets. Difficult to combat due to the virus being very good in mimicry, as well as capable of forming a [[Group mind (science fiction)|hive mind]] that could direct its own mutations.

It may be a type of fungus, as [[Ron Weasley]] says that the effect of being unable to speak occurs \"once the fungus has spread to your uvula\". The only known cure, according to the portrait of a Healer in [[St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries]], is to bind the [[liver]] of a [[toad]] around the victim's throat and stand [[nude]] in a barrel of [[eel]]'s eyes under a full moon. The portrait said that he believed Ron had this disease, due to the \"[[Freckle|unsightly blemishes]]\" on his face. Ron would later use this disease in [[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]] as an excuse as to why he was unable to return to [[Hogwarts]], when in actuality he and his friends were out searching for [[Lord Voldemort]]'s [[Horcruxes]].\n|-\n| Stand Virus\n|''[[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure]]''\n|Passed down through family, however it is not hereditary. When a person is infected their family members will be infected at around the same time. It comes from a meteorite that was later made into several arrows. The symptoms of the virus are and intense, untreatable fever. If the person infected has enough willpower and survives, they earn a stand ability that is a manifestation of their soul. Not everybody suffers through the fever before obtaining a stand.\n|-\n|Stone Sickness\n|''[[The Edge Chronicles]]'' by [[Paul Stewart (writer)|Paul Stewart]] and [[Chris Riddell]]\n|Not a human disease, but one that affects humans and other inhabitants of the Edge by attacking the rocks of the flight ships that are the primary means of transport and communication on the Edge. As the flight ships are carried aloft by the rocks, this puts an end to business and trade, resulting in a brief societal collapse followed by a gradual rebuilding of society when the Edge's inhabitants become accustomed to life with Stone-sickness. Symptoms of infected flight rocks include a brief scar, followed by an open wound and a gaping hole as the rock dissolves. Eventually the sky ship drops clean out of the sky. Many theories abound on the origin of Stone-sickness. Some people blame the gods. Others blame the Mother Storm, the mysterious meteorological creator of the Edge. Some say that the sky pirate captain Cloud Wolf who perished in the Mother Storm somehow infected her and the Stone-sickness is a result of his pestilence. It is only at the end of the series that it is revealed the Gloamglozer created the disease and it had been incubating inside the Stone Gardens ever since he fled the city of Sanctaphrax almost a century before the sickness.\n|-\n|Stripes\n|''[[A Bad Case of Stripes]]'' by [[David Shannon]]\n|An unnamed disease that causes the affected individual to change color/pattern when names of patterns are used. Apparently it can only be cured and prevented by lima beans.\n|-\n|[[Smallpox|Super-smallpox]]\n|''[[Stormbreaker]]''\n|A genetically engineered version of the smallpox virus that Iraq made in the Gulf War. Herod Sayle used the disease in his plans for vengeance. He genetically modified it so it would kill whoever it infected immediately. Fortunately, the plan was stopped by Alex and the virus was taken and quarantined by MI6. Implied in ''Snakehead'' that Sayle acquired the virus (apparently the R-5) from SCORPIA, a SPECTRE-like criminal organisation that sponsored his project.\n|-\n|\"T4 Angel Virus\"\n|''[[The Hollows (series)|Hollows (series)]]'' by [[Kim Harrison]]\n|The result of genetic engineering, the T4 Angel Virus was spread by infected tomatoes. It wiped out a large percentage of humanity, along with the elves and several other species that had been secretly coexisting.

When a human is infected by it, the disease will infect all cells, eventually resulting in the [[clinical death]] of the host. The symptoms that occur before the victim's clinical death, include [[fever]], [[headache]], [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], [[confusion]], [[hallucinations]] and [[paralysis]]. The disease has a very short [[incubation period]] of around 16 hours. After the victim's clinical death, the host will be revitalized and will wake up exhibiting [[zombie (fictional)|zombie]]-like behavior. However the disease will only activate lower brain function, mostly those controlled by the brain-stem, where feeding and motor functions are controlled. The host becomes a violent mindless [[cannibal]], and can infect other people by biting. The disease leads to society's collapse and results in a world stricken by a [[zombie apocalypse]]. The transmission of TS-19 has been variable and inconsistent in the media: A person that dies of asphyxiation will become reanimated by the virus, implying an airborne capability, yet it does not affect living humans. A pregnant woman that recently gives birth to a child will most likely succumb to the virus due to less-than-sanitary conditions and a weakened immune system.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} And walkers can transmit the virus through scratches and bites but not through blood and other bodily fluids making contact with a living person's skin.\n|-\n|V-CIDS\n|<span style=\"display:none\">Immortals</span>''[[The Immortals (Hickman novel)|The Immortals]]''\n|An [[AIDS]]-like virus.\n|-\n|Vampiris\n|''[[I Am Legend (novel)|I Am Legend]]''<br />by [[Richard Matheson]]\n|A [[bacillus]] (rod-shaped) bacterium that causes photosensitivity, hysterical blindness near mirrors, overdevelopment of canine teeth, and production of a bulletproof adhesive.

It has been theorized that the process is guided by the victim's own subconscious, influenced by the person's desires or fears. In this way, the virus works as a modern Aladdin's Lamp. The transformation is extremely individual, no two persons are affected in exactly the same way. In 90% of cases, the victim's body cannot assimilate the extreme changes, and the person dies horribly. These cases are called black queens. From the survivors, 9 out of 10 are changed for the worse, becoming monstrous creatures nicknamed jokers.

The trump virus is only successful in about twenty-four percent of attempts. Forty-seven percent of the time it doesn't work at all, and an appalling twenty-nine percent of the time, it outright kills the patient. In other words, it is more likely to kill than cure.

The first symptom of the disease is usually a painful rash, which develops into a scabby or weeping wound. In later stages, tissues become soft and slough away. The initial rash stage can be exacerbated by harsh physical trauma, as was seen when one afflicted woman discovered hand-shaped rashes on her body, where she had recently been tightly held during a passionate [[one night stand|sexual encounter]]. It also seemed to indicate that physical exertion also accelerates the progression of the disease. The disease is transmitted when an infected creatures' blood is exposed to a victim's bloodstream (bare skin contact with infectious blood is implied to not result in infection). It can also be contracted through [[sexually transmitted diseases|unprotected sexual activity]] and by [[Waterborne diseases|drinking contaminated water]]. The disease spreads cross-species and was initially discovered in a dead dog. Where the dog contracted the disease is unknown. Despite the name of the franchise, fever is never indicated as being a symptom of the disease.\n|-\n|Geostigma\n|''[[Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children]]''\n|A disease caused by [[Jenoba|Jenova]]'s presence in the Lifestream as it rose to destroy Meteor in the ending of ''[[Final Fantasy VII]]''. Decreases the efficiency of the body's [[immune system]]-like inner Lifestream current. Also causes exhaustion and black sores appearing on the skin. Mostly affects children due to their weaker constitutions. Healed by [[Aerith Gainsborough]]'s Great Gospel healing rain. \"The Stigma. It is a symptom of alien matter infesting the body. The body tries to eliminate it, and overcompensates. Inside our bodies is a current like the Lifestream. That current is what fights off any malevolent intruders.\"  \u2013 [[Vincent Valentine]]\n|-\n|Hemoglophagia (HGV)\n|''[[Ultraviolet (film)|Ultraviolet]]''\n|Disease responsible for turning many humans into [[vampire]]-like creatures. Contrary to most vampiral diseases, hemoglophagia drastically shortens the lifespan of an infected individual to little over a decade.\n|-\n|The Host's Disease\n|''[[The Host (2006 film)|The Host]]''\n|The unnamed disease carried by the giant monster terrorizing [[South Korea]]. In actuality, there was no virus; the government claimed the monster was spreading a disease just to save face.\n|-\n|Infertility epidemic\n|''[[Children of Men]]''\n|A mysterious epidemic has led to worldwide [[infertility]] in women. The human race has lost the ability to reproduce. However, the story involves a woman who secretly turns out to be pregnant and, as a result, holds the only hope of survival in her child who is immune to the epidemic.\n|-\n|Krippin Virus (KV)\n|''[[I Am Legend (film)|I Am Legend]]''\n|A genetically re-engineered [[measles]] virus originally created as a \"miracle cure\" for [[cancer]], but mutated into a lethal, highly pathogenic strain. KV has a 90% mortality rate; less than 1% of humans are [[immune]]. Two transmission vectors for the pathogen are inhalation and infected blood, with two corresponding immunity profiles. Infected humans who did not die began exhibiting early symptoms of [[rabies]] and degenerated into a state driven by rage. A major symptom is that the [[adrenal gland]]s are \"permanently open\", giving victims increased strength, speed and agility but also a faster [[metabolism]]. This results in increased [[body temperature]], [[heart rate]], and breathing speed, making those infected [[hyperventilation|hyperventilate]] constantly. Pupils became permanently dilated and skin became hypersensitive to [[UV radiation]], forcing infected hosts into a [[Nocturnality|nocturnal life cycle]]. Loss of body hair is another symptom. Non-humans such as [[rat]]s and dogs are also susceptible to KV. They are sensitive to blood. These infected are similar to [[vampire]]s.\n|-\n|Lamanla virus\n| ''[[Wolf Warrior 2]]''\n|\"Symptoms include the sudden onset fever, hallucinations, lesions, cold sweats. It is a fatal virus that's transmitted through direct human contact. Upon contraction, death strikes between four hours and five months.\"\n|-\n|Lampington's Disease\n|''Last Holiday''\n|In the original [[Last Holiday (1950 film)|1950 film]], the disease seems to have been a tumor in the abdomen (the patient's x-ray is used to indicate something ''\"between the stomach and the small intestine,\"'' although a shot of the pelvis is actually being shown). Here, it is an untreatable, terminal condition which is nearly pain-free, but which leads to coma and death within a couple of weeks to a couple of months at the most. It is explained as a recently discovered condition, described by and named for Sir Trevor Lampington, a character who also appears in the plot. In the [[Last Holiday (2006 film)|2006 remake]], the disease has morphed into a neurological disease causing multiple [[brain tumor]]s, rapidly progressing to death within a few weeks if not treated with an exorbitant operation.\n|-\n|MM88\n|''[[Virus (1980 film)|Virus]]''\n| MM88 is a deadly type of [[virus]] created accidentally by an American [[geneticist]] that amplifies the potency of any other virus or bacterium it comes into contact with. It has a 100% mortality rate; however, the virus is inactive at temperatures below -10 degrees Celsius. The virus is stolen and is found in [[East Germany]], and during an attempt to steal it back it is released accidentally after the plane carrying it crashes. A [[pandemic]] spreads worldwide and is dubbed the \"Italian Flu\". Eventually wiping out all vertebrate life on Earth except for a grouping of Antarctic scientists and submariner's from various nations, the survivors set up a government council at the various research stations at the time of the devastating global pandemic and attempt to survive; however, the air worldwide is contaminated, making Antarctica the only safe place for the roughly 800 or so survivors.\n|-\n\n|MacGregor's Syndrome\n|''[[Batman & Robin (film)|Batman & Robin]]''\n|A four-stage disease that [[Mr. Freeze]]'s wife, [[Nora Fries|Nora]], was suffering from and was placed in [[Cryopreservation|cryogenic stasis]] for. The film also revealed that [[Batman]]'s butler, [[Alfred Pennyworth]], was also suffering from Stage-1 MacGregor's. Mr. Freeze successfully created the antidote for Stage-1 of the disease, and gave some of it to Batman as an apology for thinking that Batman killed Nora (which was actually a lie fabricated by [[Poison Ivy (comics)|Poison Ivy]]).\n|-\n|Mad Zombie Disease\n|''[[Zombieland]]''\n|The disease which caused people, upon receiving a bite from one of the infected, to become zombies. The disease is a mutation of Mad Cow Disease, which became Mad Human Disease, and then mutated to form Mad Zombie Disease.\n|-\n|Malignalitaloptereosis\n|''[[The Sword in the Stone (1963 film)|The Sword in<br /> the Stone]]''\n|A rare disease which causes the victim to break out in spots, followed by hot and cold flashes, then violent sneezing. During the wizard's duel, Merlin had transformed himself into the germ that caused this disease and infected Madam Mim with it, causing her to become sick and lose the duel.\n|-\n|Meningoencephalitis Virus One (MEV-1)\n|''[[Contagion (2011 film)|Contagion]]''\n|A highly contagious and lethal [[Paramyxoviridae|paramyxovirus]] that infects both the lungs and the brain, causing coughing, fever and severe headache, progressing over the period of a few hours to seizures and ultimately death.\n|-\n|Methuselah Syndrome\n|''[[Blade Runner]]''\n|A genetic disease resembling [[progeria]] that causes faster aging.\n|-\n|Motaba\n|''[[Outbreak (film)|Outbreak]]''\n|A deadly, virulent [[Ebola]]-like [[virus]] from the jungles of Zaire, which later infected a fictional California town within a few days.\n|-\n|Nerve Attenuation Syndrome (NAS)\n|''[[Johnny Mnemonic (film)|Johnny Mnemonic]]''\n|AKA \"The Black Shakes,\" Progressive seizure disorder prevalent in society due to the overabundance of technology and the use of cybernetics. Attacks are sporadic, but become more frequent over time until the victim expires.\n|-\n|Neurological Degeneration Syndrome, or NDS\n|''[[Absolon (film)|Absolon]]''\n|A highly-contagious airborne virus, released into the atmosphere from the destruction of the Amazon rainforest causes quick and painful deaths.  The only way of controlling the virus is expensive, daily, painful injections of the drug Absolon. Society has been rebuilt on the sale of Absolon, a multibillion-dollar + industry. A detective [[Christopher Lambert]] searches for the killer who murdered the scientist who has found a cure for NDS, potentially making Absolon worthless.\n|-\n|NRS and UBT\n|''[[Demolition Man (film)|Demolition Man]]''\n|These are the names of two [[sexually transmitted disease|STD]] epidemics that occurred during the thirty-six years Spartan was incarcerated via cybergenics, and both were presumably just as bad as the [[HIV]] outbreak, both of which made sex, kissing, and even touching each other both illegal and greatly feared by the populace.\n|-\n|<span style=\"display:none\">Patriot</span>\n|''[[The Patriot (1998 film)|The Patriot]] (1998)''\n|A unnamed highly contagious airborne virus which has been stolen from a government [[biological warfare]] laboratory. Its early symptoms include a rash, and it is quickly fatal. It is not clear in the film whether the virus was supposed to have been harvested from the wild (such as [[Ebola]]) and then grown as a weapon, or whether the laboratory first engineered it in some way. In the film, the leader of a local militia has obtained both the virus and what he believes to be a [[vaccine]] for it, and decides to start an epidemic with the virus, believing that he will be safe because he has taken the vaccine. A local doctor of Indian (Native American) ancestry fights to find a cure for it.\n|-\n|[[Rage (virus)|Rage (Human Cortico-Deficiency Virus)]]\n|''[[28 Days Later]]''<br />''[[28 Weeks Later]]''\n|Rage causes extreme [[aggression]] in a victim ten to thirty seconds after being Infected with the disease. The disease is easily transmissible through any [[body fluid|bodily fluid]], except apparently semen. Because of this [[Infectious disease|extreme contagiousness]] and very short [[Incubation period|incubation time]], a crowd of hundreds could be infected by one single individual in a manner of minutes. A [[28 Days Later: The Aftermath|graphic novel]] based on the films purports that Rage is a [[recombinant virus|recombinant strain]] of [[Ebola]], though its symptoms are similar to that of [[rabies]]. Animal testing was being performed on the disease but one animal was released by activists unaware of the virus. The [[infection]] soon spread to eliminate the entire population of Britain save a few lucky individuals who managed to survive. Infected organisms die out in a few months, succumbing to [[starvation]], since they do not actually eat their victims. They also seem to drool blood constantly, due to the virus causing massive amounts of adrenaline to be pumped through the body, giving the infected heightened strength and endurance, to the point where they are able to completely overlook devastating injuries, such as loss of limbs. The infected also sport red eye colour, and bleed from the eyes, mouth and nose.\n|-\n|Reaper\n|''[[Doomsday (2008 film)|Doomsday]]''\n|Reaper causes effects similar to [[bubonic plague]]. It appeared in Scotland in the year 2008 and killed most of the inhabitants. Scotland was put under quarantine. Some decades later, Reaper reappears in London. A cure is found several days later, but it is unknown whether or not it will be given to the population.\n|-\n|Red Death\n|''[[Osmosis Jones]]''\n|Thrax, the film's main antagonist, was a strain of this disease. Symptoms include eventual extreme increase in body temperature. Most likely a strain of [[streptococcus]].\n|-\n|Say the Opposite of What You Mean Disease\n|''[[Ace Ventura: Pet Detective]]''\n|A disease which causes the speaker to say the opposite of the correct answer to a question posed by another party. This disease was thought up on the spot by Ace after he realizes that the people in the bar think poorly of Ray Finkle.\n|-\n| ALZ-112, ALZ-113, \"Simian Flu\"\n|[[Planet of the Apes]] reboot series\n|A genetically engineered retrovirus that was created in Gen-sys Laboratories in San Francisco. It was originally designed to be a cure for [[Alzheimer's disease]]. The ALZ-112 increased intelligence in apes and cured humans but only for a temporary period because of their immune systems creating antibodies to fight the virus. ALZ-113 was a stronger version of the drug, but it developed into a viral airborne and contact strain that wiped out most of the human race leaving only 1 in 500 immune to the virus. In humans it developed symptoms including sneezing, headache, sore throat, fever, vomiting, red eyes, coughing and finally death. The virus later mutates and causes temporary bleeding from the nose and mouth and degenerates most humans into a more [[caveman]]-like state by making them lose their ability to speak and making them less intelligent. In [[apes]] it increases their intelligence beyond that of a normal humans, makes their irises green, gives them a more human locomotion, such as extended upright walking and usage of primitive weapons in a human manner and alters their vocal cords to that of a humans, granting them the power of speech.\n|-\n|SP-43\n|[[Derailed (2002 film)|''Derailed'' (2002)]]\n|SP-43 is a modified form of [[smallpox]] (variola) that has an extremely short incubation period. Its development is part of the back story, which is not completely clear, but given the fact that it appears to have been stolen in Slovakia and is being transported to Munich by a NATO agent, it appears to have been developed by the [[Czechoslovakian|Czechoslovak]] government or some other [[Eastern Bloc]] country during the Cold War.\n|-\n|Space Herpes\n|[[The Ice Pirates]]\n|Extremely dangerous.

If it enters another animal, it fuses with every cell of the host, possessing the host entirely. Each infected cell becomes an individual life form with its own desire to survive. An infected cell will seek out other cells to infect with its virus, and will work together with other infected cells to imitate other life forms. Because infected cells can rapidly duplicate and shapeshift, and because dislocated, pieces of an infected host will shapeshift and become separate entities. Infected hosts can only be killed if every individual cell is destroyed. Finally, hosts retain their knowledge and memories, allowing the virus to perfectly imitate any person and remain undetected. The only effective way of killing the Thing monsters is through incineration, for instance with a flamethrower.\n|-\n|Tunguska Spores\n|''[[Metallica|''Metallica's'']] [[All Nightmare Long|All Nightmare Long]]'' Music Video\n|Extraterrestrial spores resembling armored worms that mimic other cells in a foreign organism helping the host and if the host is deceased the spores will proceed to revive the organism, However use of the spores results with unreasonable anger. \n|-\n|Wexler's Curtain (Autotoxic Hematosa)\n| [[Short Time (film)|''Short Time'']]\n|\"A progressive blood disorder in which the lymphatic system actually attacks the red blood cells, mistaking them for an invading virus.

If the cells have not reached the brain, the victim can be cured.\n|-\n|Diminished Gluteal Syndrome (DGS)\n|''[[King of the Hill]]''\n|A fictional genetic disorder characterized by a person being born without buttocks, forcing them to sit on their tailbone and cause pain in their back. The disease has no cure or treatment, although fake silicone buttocks are able to relieve pain caused by sitting on the spine. \n|-\n|Double Prison Plague (Shackelitis)\n|''[[Hogan's Heroes]]'' Episode: ''The Prisoner's Prisoner''\n|A fictional disease invented by Colonel Hogan. In the early stages, the victim's neck will swell but the victim will not feel any different. In the second stage, the victim's body heat will go up dramatically, followed by loss of movement in the legs and furious chills.\n|-\n|Drafa Plague\n|''[[Babylon 5]]''\n|Destroys cells that produce neurotransmitters in the [[synapse|synaptic gap]], thus inhibiting [[Action potential|nerve signals]] from the brain to the rest of the body. Without such signals from the brain, the organs lose their ability to function correctly, much like [[ALS]] in humans. It is only contagious among those alien species which used specialized cells to produce neurotransmitters, and among these species, it is 100% terminal within 24 hours of the onset of symptoms. Initial symptoms include dizziness, numbness & tingling in the extremities, sore throat, followed by progressively worsening ascending paralysis, euphoria, memory issues, then death. Fortunately for most of the other sentient races in Babylon 5, their lack of such specialized neurotransmitter cells render them immune to the disease, save for the Pak'Ma'Ra, whose Green Cells were similar enough to the Markab Yellow Cells that a Pak'Ma'Ra died of it on the station. The disease caused the Markab to go extinct.\n\nSimilar to the Black Death and HIV/AIDS among Humans, the Drafa Plague bears a stigma among the Markab as a disease that the public felt was only caught by those considered sinful, immoral or unclean by Markab standards, and a punishment by their gods for committing such acts. The disease was named after an island on their homeworld where its inhabitants were wiped out by the disease, an island noted in Markab history for its decadence and immorality. The story of the island was eventually used to frighten small Markab children into behaving. Even accusing a Markab of being infected with the disease can bring shame, paranoia, fear, and an angry response from the accused, and Markab doctors would frequently certify someone's death from the disease as death by natural causes, so the family could avoid a scandal and the implied accusation that they or their family were unclean or immoral.\n|-\n|Ecola\n|''[[Spaceballs: The Animated Series]]''\n|[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]] and [[Ebola]] injected into a carbonated drink, creating a \"deadly soda that will kill our enemies.\" Drinking the soda causes immediate and profuse vomiting, which then spreads the disease. Even plants can contract it.\n|-\n|[[Gonnorhea|Electrogonnorhea]]\n|''[[Futurama]]''\n|An [[Sexually transmitted disease|STD]] humans can contract from robots.

Curable by having the Pok\u00e9mon expunge the excess electricity.\n|-\n|[[Epideme]]\n|''[[Red Dwarf]]''\n|An intelligent virus, originally devised as a smoking cure. It was intended as a cure nicotine addiction, but in practice it rapidly consumes the host before hijacking the body, and then attempting to transfer itself to another suitable host via bites or saliva transmission. If no hosts are available, epideme can force its host into a state of hibernation, encasing the body in a tomb of ice-like material until it detects life nearby and thaws. Epideme steals the knowledge from every host it consumes, which has crafted it into an extremely smart, eccentric and deadly virus.\n|-\n|[[European flu]]\n|''[[Survivors (2008 TV series)]]''\n|A strain of flu based on the real [[Spanish flu]], but has killed 99.9% of mankind.\n|-\n|Fluvus Pestilentia\n|''[[Grimm (TV series)|Grimm]] ([[Quill (Grimm)|Quill]])''\n|An enterobacteria affecting only Wesen, characterised by lack of inhibitions, strong affection, yellow boils, and, finally, psychosis.\n|-\n|Fried Chicken Flu  (KFC virus)\n|''[[The Fried Chicken Flu]] ([[Boondocks]])''\n|Actually [[salmonella]], but initially believed to be something far worse, causing the collapse of several governments before the real cause is revealed.\n|-\n|Genie Flu\n|''[[Genie in the House]]''\n|A disease of Genies which causes them to change colours, become invisible and have squeaky voices.\n|-\n|Geodermic granititis\n|''[[Look Around You]]''\n|A disease that attacks the central nervous system, fooling it into calcifying the bodily tissue, eventually turning the victim into a pile of rocks. More commonly known as '''cobbles'''.\n|-\n|[[Cyberbrain Sclerosis#Cyberbrains|Cyberbrain Sclerosis]]\n|''[[Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex]]''\n|A disease characterized by a hardening of the brain tissues precipitated by the cyberization process. It is described as being that century's cancer or tuberculosis. Cyberbrain [[Sclerosis (medicine)|Sclerosis]] is described as being extremely rare, enough so that it doesn't deter most people from being cyberized, but it is incurable once diagnosed.\n|-\n|Ghost Sickness\n|''[[Supernatural (U.S. TV series)|Supernatural]]''\n|A sickness which is contracted from prolonged proximity with ghosts, which causes hallucinations, fever, chills and extreme fear. [[Dean Winchester]] contracted this disease from an evil ghost he encountered and became immensely afraid of every single thing he encountered, even being afraid of a cat. The vanquishing of the ghost defeated the disease.\n|-\n|Groat's Disease\n|''[[Curb Your Enthusiasm]]''\n|A neurological disorder presumed to have a high mortality rate through a slow, painful process. [[Rob Reiner]] describes it affecting \"kids and adults who have a tough time controlling their hyperactivity. It is as if you were on five cups of coffee at all times.\" It was named after the doctor who discovered it. Larry David, who writes the show, came up with the name of the disease when he thought baseball player [[Dick Groat]]'s name sounded like the name of a disease and in the show Larry assumes it was named for Dick Groat, who he assumes must have had the disease because, as Larry says, \"he didn't field very well because he was excited all the time.\"\n|-\n|Hades\n|''[[Covert One: The Hades Factor]]''\n|A blood-borne/airborne virus that causes severe internal hemorrhaging and bleeding from every orifice.

Kills within another 24 hours.\n|-\n|Hate Plague\n|''[[Transformers (fiction)|Transformers]]''\n|[[Bacteria]]l [[spore]] of unknown origin transmitted by touch. Induces extreme [[paranoia]] and [[aggression]] in the infected, causing them to strike out against anyone or anything in an increasingly maddening desire to destroy. Symptoms include a deep reddish glow emanating from the infected. The only curative is intense logic and wisdom, which presumably counters the extreme irrationality the disease causes in its victims. First appearing during the Autobot-Decepticon wars (which necessitated the second resurrection of Optimus Prime), a relatively milder strain is seen again during the events of Beast Machines; Megatron triggers a pre-planted virus in Silverbolt, infecting him and the rest of the Maximals. The strain is cured, again, by intense logic and wisdom.\n|-\n|Harvester Virus\n|''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]:'' \"[[Armageddon Game]]\"\n|Described as a \"nanobiogenic weapon\", the Harvesters were developed by the T'Lani and Kellerun from a small synthetic virus that was, itself, very lethal; the deadly and much feared weapon used during their centuries-long war killed by disrupting the victim's genetic structure, and had completely devastated the entire population of T'Lani III. So feared was this virus, that even after peace was made and the harvesters were disposed of in a ten-year project, the two governments secretly made plans to assassinate the scientists who worked on the project, fearing what might happen if they were ever remade.\n|-\n|Heart virus\n|''[[Dragon Ball Z]]''\n|Is a virus that affects one's heart, Goku acquired this virus from an unknown location and had to be bedridden for days.

[[Bulma]] creates a cure for this virus so that Trunks can take it back in time to save Goku and stop the androids.\n|-\n|Head-go-boom-boom-itis\n|''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]] (Squid baby)''\n|A mental disorder that causes adults that receive a head injury to develop a brain tumor that causes them to exhibit infantile-behavior, while still possessing the physical traits of an adult.\n|-\n|Head Pigeons\n|''[[Invader Zim]] (Dark Harvest)''\n|A disease that involves a pigeon nesting on one's head. Ms. Bitters also implied the disease was contagious, ordering Zim to leave before it spread to the other Skoolchildren, although this seems unlikely. The treatment entails visiting a nurse, or other trained medical professional. Eventually, the pigeon flies away, and the victim is deemed cured.\n|-\n|Hepatitis V\n|''[[True Blood]]''\n|A virulent strain of hepatitis designed as a biological anti-vampire weapon. Instead of killing them, it causes them to enter a zombie-like state: they lose all sense and become feral and aggressive, feeding and killing constantly.\n|-\n|Hinamizawa Syndrome\n|''[[List of When They Cry episodes|When They Cry/When The Cicadas Cry/Higurashi no Naku Koro ni]]''\n|A mental disease similar to [[schizophrenia]]. It is often referred to as \"The Curse of Oyashiro sama\" by the townspeople who have no knowledge of the disease and instead relate it to a supposed curse on the town by its guardian god, Oyashiro sama.Through history the villagers imposed rules to prevent the populous from becoming \"demons\" or in reality, stopping the symptoms from progressing. It causes [[paranoia]]-inducing [[hallucinations]] which progressively grow more threatening as the victim becomes more paranoid. In the case of the character [[Keiichi Maebara]], it caused his friends' humored laughter to seem maniacal, and their tone of voice more threatening and sinister than it was. Eventually, he hallucinated a marker held by Mion Sonozaki to be a syringe, having heard that a murderer in the town was on drugs. This caused him to kill Mion, as well as Rena Ryuuguu, with a baseball bat. In most cases, the end result of the disease involves [[suicide]], which Keiichi did by clawing his throat out. Rena also once attempted suicide from the syndrome by cutting her wrist with a knife. It is revealed later in the series that Hanyuu, the incarnation of Oyashiro, was responsible for some of the paranoia, mostly that one is being watched or followed. However, the disease was still mostly psychological.\n|-\n|Holovirus\n|''[[Red Dwarf]]: [[Quarantine (Red Dwarf)|Quarantine]]''\n|Discovered, contracted and possibly created by viral researcher Hildeguard Lanstrom, this nasty condition can only be passed between holograms. It can be transmitted across radio-waves and drains the victim's life-force while endowing them with powers such as telepathy, telekinesis and hex-vision. The sufferer tends to go insane long before his or her demise.\nSuggested treatment: A remote link to the hologram disk projection system, a detachable power transfer adapter capable of holding spikes of up to five million volts, and a B47/7RF resistor. Plus confiscation of equally deranged penguin glove-puppet\n|-\n|Hopping Cough\n|''[[The Smurfs]]''\n|A plague created by the smurfs' enemy [[Gargamel]] to use as a biological weapon against them; a victim of this contagious disease coughs violently and leaps very high into the air with each cough.\n|-\n|Irumodic Syndrome\n|''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation|Star Trek The Next Generation]]''\n|A [[neurological]] disease caused by a [[congenital disorder|defect]] in the [[Human brain|brain]]'s [[parietal lobe]].

The virus spread throughout the school via hugging or by touching . Those infected were dubbed \"huggers\" by the character Miss Simian. The cure was hearing anything depressing like the song \"[[Moonlight Sonata]]\".\n|-\n|Jungle Worms\n|''[[iCarly]]''\n|A disease that causes fever, sweating, and vomiting. The disease itself only appears a few times in the show.

In the episode \"Once Bitten\", Gary bites Squidward and most of the citizens of Bikini Bottom. Due to misinformation over the disease, they believe they are zombies and chase SpongeBob until Dr. Gil Gilliams, SDE, SE (Snail Disease Expert and Snail Expert) informs them that \"Mad Snail Disease\" is nothing more than an [[urban legend]].

Several decades later, the crew of new ''Enterprise'' is infected by what seems to be the same disease, and in this instance, it proves spreadable by mere touch and is able to infect Data, an android. While Commander Riker is able to learn about the previous incident from the ship's records, McCoy's cure proves ineffective this time, Dr. Crusher believing it may be \"mutated\".

A cure is eventually found (same episode) by the Enterprise's First Officer/Science Officer, [[Spock]], when he finds vast amounts of medical knowledge that had been preserved on an ancient Fabrini computer.  Xenopolycythemia is also mentioned on [[Star Trek: Enterprise|Star Trek : Enterprise]], Season 2, Episode 19 (Judgment) and was used as a ploy against the [[Klingon]]s when [[Phlox (Star Trek)|Dr. Phlox]] claimed that the disease was contagious.\n|}\n\n== In video games ==\n<!-- PLEASE NOTE: Only additions of nonexistent, named medical conditions which appear in fiction where they have a major plot or thematic importance are welcome, if unsure ask on the talk page first-->\n<!-- Please do [[wikilink]] to the relevant *medical* concepts -->\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Name\n!Source\n!Symptoms\n|-\n|The Affliction\n|''[[Guild Wars]]''\n|Also referred to as 'The Canthan Plague'. A disease that spread in Cantha, causing victims to become hulking, aggressive, pained creatures known as 'the afflicted'. It was seen to affect humans, [[cattle]], and various animals in a menagerie. The sufferers were initially believed to be contagious, but this was later found out to be false.\n|-\n|Ancient virus\n|''[[Resident Evil]]'' series\n|A rare viral strain found in queen ant genes. It was discovered by Alexia Ashford, while she was studying [[ant]]s. When combined with the Progenitor Virus, it creates the powerful T-Veronica virus. Probably the control power of it is due the Ancient virus.\n|-\n|Angel Toxicosis\n|''[[Tales of Symphonia]]''\n|The name given by Raine Sage to symptoms of Cruxis Crystal parasitism. Causes victim to eventually lose ability to taste, sleep, cry, feel pain, and talk. Also increases the victim's hearing, strength and sight abilities, as well as eliminating the need to eat and sleep. In early beginnings it allows the victim to gain crystal-like wings and fly until the disease is destroyed. The final stage of this diseases causes the victim to give up his/her heart and memory, and ultimately their life. The disease lasts for an unknown time, those afflicted are slowly \"given\" the symptoms via blessings of a person with a mounted Cruxis Crystal. A major example is Collette, one of the 8 protagonists of the game.\n|-\n|Atma Virus\n|''[[Digital Devil Saga]]''\n|A mystical, noncommunicable virus which marks its carriers with a tattoo-like mark somewhere on their bodies. Carriers are immune to Cuvier Syndrome can transform into a demonic reflection of their inner personalities, referred to as [[Atma (Hinduism)|Atma]]. However, everyone with the virus feels an insatiable hunger for the flesh of other carriers. If this hunger is resisted for too long, the carrier will eventually enter an irreversible state of mindless bloodlust, losing the ability to return to human form.\n|-\n|Asmodeus\n|''[[Terranigma]]''\n|Many ages before Ark's adventure to the surface of the world, the previous generations of Humanity were decimated by an airborne virus with an estimated mortality rate of 90%. The virus was named by Dr. Beruga who was able to synthesize a vaccine of 80% effectiveness for it. Asmodeus was later utilized as a bio-weapon to completely depopulate a city, save for one child survivor who was seemingly unaffected and hid underground.\n|-\n|Blacklight Virus\n|''[[Prototype (series)|Prototype]]''\n|The Blacklight virus \"plugs in\" and activates the junk DNA in a target, causing biological changes that create (and recreate) a sentient mind inside the infected creature. It acts by affecting the protein encoding regions of the promoter introns in each cell. As a retrovirus, it contains both RNA and the reverse transcriptase enzyme, allowing it to insert its own genetic codes into living cells. It enters, re-purposes and changes the cell, replicating previously dormant non-coding segments of DNA. More often than not, these changes are too drastic and 99.99% of subjects die from massive organ failure and cell saturation.However some variants have yielded other beneficial results; endowing the infected organisms with incredible superhuman genetic prowess, that greatly increase their natural abilities to levels far exceeding human capability.\n|-\n|Blight Disease\n|''[[Dragon Age]]''\n|The Blight disease is a kind of corruption spread by the evil Darkspawn. The disease corrupts all living organisms which either go mad, develop physical afflictions, and/or perish outright.The longer an infected creature 'lives', the more it will manifest [[hair loss]], aggressive or even rabid behavior and numerous deformities, protrusions, boils and sores.\n|-\n|Chimeran Virus\n|''[[Resistance: Fall of Man]]''\n|It mutates human DNA the infected into chimeran DNA thus make them as the enemies of the series.\n|-\n|Chronic Angelus Crystallus Inofficium\n|''[[Tales of Symphonia]]''\n|A progressive disease caused by a Cruxis Crystal mounted upon a Key Crest.

When the crystallization reaches the internal organs, the sufferer perishes.\n|-\n|Chrono-displasia\n|''[[League of Legends]]''\n|A mystical disease that grants immortality but detaches the sufferer's consciousness from the present time, making his mind drift through time, from any point he has already lived to the present, unable to impact the events which unfold.\n|-\n|Corprus\n|''[[The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind]]''\n|Corprus causes incredible mutations in humanoids, but it is an almost non-communicable disease. People infected with blight are often sent to a special institution called the Corprusarium, which was made for researching corprus. Corprus is caused by the volcanic ash that emanates from Red Mountain, but, as a positive side effect, grants 100% disease immunity. The only known antidote is proven to destroy corprus, but ends up killing the victim as well. However, the player is able to take the antidote without any adverse effects, presumably because they are the reincarnation of Nerevar.\n|-\n|[[Cordyceps]] Brain Infection\n|''[[The Last of Us]]''\n|A mutated form of the ''Cordyceps'' fungus known as Cordyceps Brain Infection (abbreviated to CBI) that infects the United States in 2013, causing humans to transform into cannibalistic monsters known as the infected. The virus destroys most of civilization over the course of 20 years, leaving 60% of humanity either infected or dead, with the surviving human population either living in heavily policed quarantine zones, isolated communities or nomadic groups. The infected beings are split between four categories depending on how long they were infected for: Runners - fast, irritable and hostile, caused within 1\u20132 days of being infected; Stalkers - fast, aggressive and stealthy, caused within 1 week to 1 month of being infected; Clickers - despite being blind, they use echolocation to locate enemies and are also strong, caused within 2\u20134 years of being infected; and Bloaters - also blind and use echolocation, they are also armored, powerful and extremely aggressive, caused within 10 years of being infected. \n|-\n|[[Corrupted Blood]]\n|''[[World of Warcraft]]''\n|Initially contracted from fighting Hakkar, the God of Blood, in the dungeon of Zul'Gurub. Highly infectious, with an [[incubation period]] of 2 seconds and can infect any person in the immediate area. Referred to players as \"the Plague\", \"Hakkar's [[SARS]]\" or \"WoW [[AIDS]]\" for a major outbreak of the [[virtual plague]] in the game due to a design oversight.\n|-\n|Creeping Derangea\n|''[[Advance Wars: Days of Ruin]]''\n|An artificial virus that is revealed to be a failed Bio-Weapon created by Dr. Caulder to test the extent of IDS technology. Due to its inherent flaw of photophobia, creeping derangea is only able to thrive when the sun was effectively blocked out by the vast amounts of dust that were kicked up into the troposphere and stratosphere by the apocalyptic meteor impact events. The Virus is initially only able to infect those under the age of 20 but a new strain is somehow introduced that can infect older hosts over time. Symptoms include headaches, paranoia, and a black diamond on the skin called \"the mark\". It causes flowers to grow inside a person and break out of the skin. A beautiful, albeit excruciatingly painful, way to die. Its scientific name is Endoflorescens terribilis. It is also known as The Creeper and the Green Thumb.\n|-\n|C-Virus\n|''[[Resident Evil]]'' series\n|A further evolved version of the T-Virus. Developed by Neo-Umbrella, it is responsible for creating the highly evolved, more intelligent J'avo, as well as being used in the worldwide bio-terrorist attacks. Jake Muller, being descended from [[Albert Wesker]], is resistant to the disease. Because of this, Jake is seemingly being hunted by Ada Wong and her agents.<ref>{{cite web| url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65Cpvq0gXl4|title = Resident Evil 6, C-Virus trailer|publisher = [[YouTube]] | accessdate = 2012-06-26}}</ref>\n|-\n|Cuvier Syndrome\n|''[[Digital Devil Saga 2]]''\n|Caused by exposure to corrupted sunlight, this noncommunicable disease petrifies the bodies of its victims, literally turning them to stone. The rate of petrification seems based on the level of sunlight exposure: one victim in full sunlight attempted suicide, but was unable to pull the trigger before being petrified. Carriers of the Atma Virus are immune.\n|-\n|Desert Herpes\n|''[[Wasteland (video game)|Wasteland]]''\n|A [[sexually transmitted disease]] that the player's character contracts if he sleeps with the three-legged prostitute he meets in the game.\n|-\n|Despair Disease\n|''[[Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair]]''\n|A pathogen created by Monokuma in order to drive the students into paranoia and irritability. Its effects depend on the person it infects: Nagito Komaeda's symptoms caused him to impulsively lie, Akane Owari became a coward, Ibuki Mioda became emotionless and gullible, and it caused Mikan Tsumiki to remember the events prior to having her memory erased. The disease wore off once there was another victim in the killing game.\n|-\n|Diathronitis\n|''[[Larn (computer game)|Larn]]''\n|Afflicts daughter of player character; serves as primary motivation for gameplay.\n|-\n|Dire AIDS\n|[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]\n|A form of AIDS that causes minor health drain when the player's turn begins.

Salvador Aihara tries to do an undercover investigation regarding Doll Syndrome in especially young children for his show \"Online Jack\".\n|-\n|Element 115\n|Call of Duty: Online, Call of Duty: Black Ops\n|Element 115 was used to create the zombies as one of its side effects was the reanimation of dead cells. The zombies were to be used as super-soldiers by the Nazis. After creating them, the Nazis realized that they were uncontrollable and would lead to mankind's destruction. Can be combined with Nova 6 to create dirty bombs.\n|-\n|Shiva I-VII\n|''[[Fallen Earth]]''\n|The SHIVA virus, or at least SHIVA I, is hinted to be an airborne virus with a quick infection exposure time, and therefore has qualities much like a modern chemical weapon. Overall the SHIVA virus appears as seven distinct forms, with naming conventions of SHIVA I through SHIVA VII, with the seventh version being mostly non-lethal. The virus is named after Shiva, the Hindu God of death due to the dance-like convulsions that it causes its victims\n|-\n|The Filth\n|''[[The Secret World]]''\n|A biological weapon willed into existence by the Dreamers in their attempts to free themselves from captivity, it manifests in a variety of forms, including poisonous gas, parasitic fungi, radio waves, and even words. The most common variant takes the form of a viscous black fluid. Exposure to the Filth results in nightmares, respiratory difficulties, paranoia, delusions, violent behavior, and eventual insanity; mutations gradually set in, resulting in victims manifesting glowing red eyes, tentacles, and exuding Filth from their skin. Sufferers ultimately fall under the influence of the Dreamers and are devoted either to releasing them from their prisons or continuing the spread of the disease. Further mutations may occur following this stage, and more exotic forms of the Filth can result in more unusual symptoms, one rare case transforming the victim into a [[Ghost|disembodied intelligence]] migrating between infected individuals. No cure exists.\n|-\n|[[Flood (Halo)|Flood Parasite]]\n|''[[Halo (series)|Halo]]''\n|The Flood Parasite is depicted in the Halo franchise as a [[parasitoid]] [[fungus]]-like pathogen that mutates infected hosts into creatures similar to [[zombie (fictional)|zombies]]. Depending on the size or condition of the Host's body, the Flood will either uses the host as-is to pursue new victims, or break it down to create \"pure forms\" from its biomass.\n|-\n|Forced Evolutionary Virus\n|''[[Fallout (series)|Fallout]]''\n|Originally known as the Pan-Immunity Viron Project, FEV, along with radiation, is responsible for many mutations in the wastelands. The most visible of these are the super mutants, former humans granted incredible strength and endurance as result of being infected. Exposure to the virus is also known to be fatal in many cases. FEV serves as a major plot element in Fallout, Fallout 2 and Fallout 3. Super mutants also appear in Fallout: New Vegas and Fallout 4.\n|-\n|FoxDie\n|''[[Metal Gear Solid (1998 video game)|Metal Gear Solid]]''\n|FoxDie is a virus responsible for killing people with certain genetic markers via cardiac arrest. FoxDie is given to protagonist Solid Snake by Dr. Naomi Hunter, only it is engineered to go off at an indeterminate time. FoxDie was also the cause of death of Liquid Snake, Decoy Octopus (impersonating DARPA chief Donald Anderson), and the ArmsTech President.\n|-\n|Frenzy Virus\n|''[[Monster Hunter 4]]''\n|The Frenzy Virus is an infectious disease originating in monsters Gore Magala and Shagaru Magala. It is transmitted through the air via black mistlike particles, or through contact with an infected specimen. Symptoms of the Frenzy Virus in monsters include heightened aggression, increased physical prowess, and a significantly shortened lifespan. In rare cases, a sufficiently powerful monster can overcome the virus. Such monsters are referred to as Apex monsters, and they obtain a strengthened version of the benefits of the virus without the main drawbacks. Player controlled hunters can also be infected, which gives them a limited amount of time before the virus activates and temporarily removes their natural regeneration. It also makes attacks from Gore Magala, Chaotic Gore Magala (A Gore Magala that has not properly shed its skin and become Shagaru Magala) Shagaru Magala, or a frenzied monster much more lethal than normal.  If a hunter manages to show enough aggression before this activation occurs, they overcome the virus, avoiding all negative effects and gaining a short-term increase in physical ability.\n|-\n|G-Virus\n|''[[Resident Evil]]'' series\n|A [[mutagenic]] pathogen which causes the host to become a big, constantly evolving, practically unstoppable killing machine, with exceedingly high attack power and immense vitality, in addition to the ability to [[regeneration (biology)|regenerate]] and mutate so quickly the carrier virtually loses its mortality. The purified virus can be injected directly into the host, or a mutated host can implant a small [[larva]]e, called a G-embryo into another host. The latter mode of transmission is most successful when the host and the new victim are genetically similar. The virus would later be merged with the T-Virus by Umbrella scientists in an attempt to balance the G-virus' rapid evolution with the T-virus' stability, creating an extremely dangerous, [[electromagnetic]]-capable variant called the T/G Virus.\n|-\n|Gagne\n|''[[Michigan: Report from Hell]]''\n|An experimental bioweapon that was developed in a consortium by the ZaKa Conglomerate, the U.S. Government, and the U.S. Military. It is a mutagenic virus that can be transmitted in the air and by contact with body fluids. Gagne takes the form of a thick fog that has covered the entirety of Chicago, Illinois and is causing animals and people to horrifically transform into grotesque monsters with large maws that can spawn leech-like larvae.\n* Stage 1: No discernible changes in physical appearance and body temperature. Actions become sluggish.\n* Stage 2: Subject begins to spawn leech-like larvae which are violently spewed from the mouth.\n* Stage 3: Subject undergoes horrific transformation and becomes aggressive and sensitive to nearby sounds.\n|-\n|Gangliated Utrophin Immuno Latency Toxin (GUILT)\n|''[[Trauma Center: Under the Knife]]''\n|A series of eight parasitic pathogens created by the medical-terrorist group Delphi. Despite its ingame introduction as a toxin, GUILT is referred as a \"moving tumor\", but behaves more like a parasite. During ingame sequences where the player operates on patients, GUILT diseases are normally shown as a pseudo-sentient core that attacks the patient from within, using lacerations, tumors and other ailments. Individual strains are named after Greek days of the week (Kyriaki, Deftera, Triti, Tetarti, Pempti, Paraskevi, Savato), the only exception being the eighth strain, called \"Bliss\". Neo-GUILT strains, which were developed independently from the original GUILT project, introduce four more strains (Nous, Bythos, Sige, Aletheia). Some GUILT survivors were also inflicted with a variation of the disease, dubbed the PGS (Post-GUILT syndrome).\n|-\n|Genophage\n|''[[Mass Effect]]''\n|A biological weapon created by the Salarians and deployed against the krogan species, designed to dramatically reduce the normal birth rate by infecting the species with genetic mutations. The plague causes most krogan pregnancies to end in stillbirth, with most fetuses never even reaching that stage of development.\n|-\n|Gray Death\n|''[[Deus Ex (video game)|Deus Ex]]''\n|A [[pandemic|global plague]] engineered using [[nanotechnology]] within a [[Universal assembler|Universal Constructor]] by [[Majestic-12]], the Gray Death virus is actually a hybrid ([[cyborg]]anic) disease of biological and mechanical structures. It is based on the adverse and ultimately lethal effects of nanotechnology on an unmodified human body. Named the Gray Death because of the gray patches of discolored [[scar|scar tissue]] that cover its victims' skins, if and when the disease is cured. Symptoms include the aforementioned discoloration of the skin, [[cough]]ing, physical [[pain]] and death.\n|-\n|Hyper-evolutionary virus\n|''[[StarCraft]]''\n|The Hyper-evolutionary virus is a [[retrovirus]] produced by Zerg Queens.

Others mutate into living bombs, utterly dominated by the Overmind. It has a re-animation side-effect. It is transmissible through fluid transfer only, much like [[Solanum]].\n|-\n|\"Harran Virus\" (Previously Unknown)\n|''[[Dying Light]]''\n|A previously mysterious rabies-like pathogen, the Harran Virus was spread within the city of Harran (likely based in Turkey) to epidemic proportions, placing the city under quarantine. As a result, many victims of the virus are initially turned into aggressive and athletic infected (called \"Virals\") before decaying into hordes of shambling and cannibalistic infected (called \"Biters\"). With this said, some of those infected by the virus may mutate into various creatures. Once the sun goes down, the pathogen alters the infected's motor-coordination and sensory, resulting the sluggish infected turning agile and vicious at night (called \"Night Walkers\") and mutated inhuman infected (called \"Volatiles\") with severe muscle exposure coming out only at night to hunt any uninfected survivors. During the night, the infected's primary weakness is [[Ultraviolet]], while the infected during the day have no specified weakness.\n|-\n|Incuritis\n|''[[Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney]]''\n|A rare, but lethal disease, curable only through the use of a medicine made from the Borginian Cocoon. The cure is very difficult to make, and if made incorrectly, it is a deadly poison, and thus the exportation of such a cocoon is illegal. The Chief Justice's son is afflicted with the disease.\n|-\n|Kepral's Syndrome\n|''[[Mass Effect 2]]''\n|A degenerative respiratory disease unique to [[Races of the Mass Effect universe#Drell|Drell]], occurring as a result of their transition from their desert homeworld of Rakhana to the Hanar ocean homeworld of Kahje; cumulative exposure to moisture results in a condition that erodes their capacity to absorb oxygen into their lungs, eventually resulting in death. It is noncommunicable, and there is currently no known cure, though its progression can be slowed through exposure to warm, arid environments.\n|-\n|Kharaa Bacterium\n|''[[Subnautica]]'' \n|Kharaa is an alien bacterium discovered by the Precursor Race during the exploration of an unknown planet. It seems to have completely taken over Planet 4546B. It is described in the Degasi PDAs as \"part of the ecosystem\", with further statements that the Degasi survivors were infected at some point - as stated by Bart Torgal while discussing the flu-like symptoms the crew was experiencing. Early on, the player's PDA and Lifepod will make note of the high levels of bacterial infection in the water. The PDA notes that Kharaa is unlike any infection thus discovered in human history, suggesting that Kharaa's biological design is far more drastic compared to diseases such as Yersinia pestis.The PDA estimates that Kharaa incubates in two weeks and quickly kills its host after it reaches a substantial infection level. It accomplishes this by shutting down the immune system (already making the infected host susceptible to other diseases) and causing genetic mutation to the host's DNA, and causing alterations to the body structure, eventually leading to a total shutdown of the organism due to its inability to keep functioning properly. \n|-\n|[[Las Plagas]]\n|''[[Resident Evil]]'' series\n|A [[parasitic]], organism which can infect a variety of [[Host (biology)|hosts]], including humans. It has the ability to control its host's behavior, inducing a [[Group mind (science fiction)|hive-like mentality]] among the infected and extreme hostility towards uninfected individuals. The infected retain most of the characteristics of humans such as fine [[motor skill]]s as seen through their use of simple weapons such as [[scythe]]s and [[axe]]s, and more complicated weapons such as [[chainsaw]]s and [[chaingun]]s. They are seen to obey \"Queen\" parasites, much like ants.\n|-\n|M2448 virus (''The Freak Virus'')\n|''[[Crackdown 2]]''\n|The virus called ''M2448'' was created by Catalina Thorne, the leader of Cell, during her time as a medical student working for the Agency. She conducted secret experiments of the virus but was discovered by the Agency and was kicked off the Agency-sponsored medical programme. She was enraged by this and wanted revenge on the Agency because it apparently ruined her life. To get her revenge she offered free vaccinations to the people of Unity Heights (formerly \"The Corridor\"), she was actually vaccinating her victims with the M2448 Virus which tuned them into Freaks. The virus spread across Unity Heights very quickly and soon made its way into the two other boroughs of Pacific City.\n|-\n|Manticore\n|''Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare''\n|A bio-weapon that was devised to target specific genotypes, and would kill anyone not in the [[Atlas Corporation|Atlas]] database.

However, if the B.O.W. is incompatible with the parasite, they die inside of twenty minutes. If they are compatible, however, the parasite acts as a second brain, taking over the functions mof the T-virus ravaged host brain. The host increases in size and strength; and become hardy enough to survive multiple gunshot wounds. The parasite's tentacles become threaded throughout the host's entire body; and can be utilized as a weapon.\n|-\n|NE-Beta Parasite\n|''[[Resident Evil]]'' series\n|The NE-Beta (Nemesis Beta) parasite is an evolved form of the NE-Alpha parasite. The parasite is capable of bonding to all B.O.W.s, from [[zombies]] to T-103 [[super soldier]]s. The parasite has an insectoid appearance, as opposed to the octopous-like form of its predecessor. However, it is prone to decapitating its host, rendering them blind and deaf.\n|-\n|Neuro-Immuno Deficiency Syndrome (N.I.D.S.)\n|<span style=\"display:none\"> Sonic The Hedgehog (series)</span>''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (series)|Sonic The Hedgehog]]''\n|A rare, incurable, and fatal disease.

This gas leaks through the cracks and kills everybody who inhales it within minutes, shortly reanimating them as psychotic zombies within a short while. It appears the gas is transmittable through bites, and therefore contagious. In hallucinations, the gas is also shown to affect animals.\n|-\n|Rustlung/Lambency\n|''[[Gears of War]]'' series\n|A fictional underground substance known as Imulsion was refined by the humans of Sera and used as a limitless fuel source. However, unknown to the humans at the time, Imulsion was a liquid fungal parasite that invades the host through spores in the Imulsion fumes. Miners of Imulsion and their families became sick with Imulsion-poisoning which would be called Rustlung, a pneumonia-like condition that expels rust-colored phlegm. The government attempted to hide and resolve the issue by imprisoning the children sick with Rustlung in the New Hope Research Facility in order to cure the disease. However, the scientist in charge, Dr. Niles Samson, went mad and genetically altered the children with the DNA of indigenous creatures from underground, resulting in the creation of the Locust Horde, the main enemy species in the game. The government learned of these unethical experiments and Dr. Niles Samson took them underground to continue his work. While underground, Rustlung, later evolving into Lambency in which the host becomes possessed by the Imulsion, began to overrun the Locust Horde, forcing them to emerge on the surface and wage war against humanity in order to escape the Lambent. All Lambent inherit Imuslion's qualities: golden glow in the dark and explosive properties. Rustlung continued to infect the human population, especially during the war against the Locust Horde, in which the Imulsion evaporated and polluted the surface with fumes due to bombing the underground. After the humans managed to flood the underground to kill both the Locust and Lambent, the seawater rose the Imulsion into the soil and caused a pandemic to occur, infecting both Locust and Humans with Lambency. Both Rustlung and Lambency are destroyed, however, when Professor Adam Fenix activates an Imulsion Countermeasure, which uses targeted levels of radiation to kill cells with Imulsion. All Imulsion was destroyed and organisms that were infected with Imulsion were killed. \n|-\n|Scurge\n|''[[Scurge: Hive]]''\n|A parasite that can infect biological, technological, or coherent energy systems. It takes about one minute to overwhelm the special filters designed to ward off its infection.\n|-\n|\"Green Flu\" (Previously Unknown)\n|''[[Left 4 Dead (series)|Left 4 Dead]],''<br />''[[Payday: The Heist|Payday The Heist: No Mercy]]''\n|The Green Flu, commonly referred to simply as The Infection, has caused most humans who come in contact with it to change into homicidal, zombie-like beings. Anyone can catch it, but there are few out there who [[Asymptomatic carrier|show no symptoms of the virus]]. They can, however, spread it to whoever comes in contact with them. These carriers seldom realize they are spreading the virus, leaving a path of destruction in their wake.\n|-\n|The Plague\n|''[[Mass Effect 2]]''\n|The Plague is a virus possibly created by the [[Races of the Mass Effect universe#Collectors|Collectors]] which infects all species except [[humans]] and [[Races of the Mass Effect universe#Vorcha|vorcha]], the latter being resistant to any infection, and the former being immediately scapegoated for the spread of the plague and hunted down by local gangs. It causes horrible sores, a bad cough and coughing up blood, caused by rapid mutations to the respiratory systems. It was being spread through the ventilation system of the slums of Omega by the vorcha under orders of the Collectors but was stopped by [[Characters of the Mass Effect universe#Commander Shepard|Shepard]] and doctor [[Mordin Solus]], since Omega has no authorities whatsoever and the affected area was simply sealed until everyone would die.\n|-\n|The Plague of Undeath\n|''[[Warcraft III]]''\n|The Plague is responsible for the entire Undead race. It can re-animate dead creatures with a reasonable degree of sentience. However, the creature is usually dominated by the undead command structure, but they can escape from the tyranny of undeath. It also causes the soil beneath and around Undead structures to change into a substance known as Blight, which is poisonous to most plants.\n|-\n|The Rat Plague\n|''[[Dishonored]]''\n|The Rat Plague killed almost half of the population of the city of Dunwall, the fictional city from the game Dishonored. Victims of the rat plague can cure themselves via use of Sokolov's Health Elixir. Once blood comes from the Nose or Eyes there is no way to be cured. It is also known as the doom of Pandyssia.\n|-\n|Rosalia Virus\n|''[[Trauma Team]]''\n|A variation of viral hemorrhagic fever, capable of killing patients in days. The virus was originally found in the blood of Rosalia Rosselini by Cumberland College professor Albert Sartre. Sartre and his son attempted to use the virus to cure all disease, but instead found that it could not be used for positive means. An outbreak of the virus occurred, resulting in the Cumberland College Incident, where Sartre and Rosalia escaped to Mexico, and his son lost all memory of the incident, but was arrested and sentenced to 250 years of imprisonment under the ID \"CR-S01\". However, Sartre was inflicted with the virus, causing him to fall to insanity, killing Rosalia. Rosalia's blood splattered onto nearby flowers, which monarch butterflies fed upon, acting as vectors that caused a second outbreak. A variation of the Rosalia virus was encountered once, when one of the Rosalia patients, Naomi Kimishima, also had a pre-existing incurable genetic disease (thought to be related to GUILT). Interactions between the genetic disease and Rosalia gave birth to a \"Twisted Rosalia\" strain, which only one case was known to be documented.\n|-\n|Scorched Plague\n|''[[Fallout 76]]''\n|A plague caused by Scorchbeasts, giant bat-like mutants created by the Enclave in 2083. Symptoms can include a loss of higher brain function, growths of Ultracite protruding from the victim's skin, and a connection to the Scorchbeast Hive Mind. Victims of the plague go through a skin transformation that goes from a charred, blackened appearance to red lesions and the appearance of being flayed alive. Scorched also develop cataracts in the eyes and experience complete hair loss. The plague wipes out most of the residents of West Virginia, save for the player characters/Vault 76 inhabitants. Additionally, all Scorched victims have a set lifespan, at the end of which they stay in a single position until their bodies petrify from the inside out. They retain enough mental faculties to operate smaller firearms and various melee weapons, as well as wear armor for protection. The Scorched are hostile toward anything that they perceive as a threat.\n|-\n|SCP-610\n| [[SCP Foundation]]\n|A highly infectious skin disease which was first reported by the Russian government in the 1970s. The disease begins as a normal skin disease which irritates the infected, causing itching and bad skin. But then searing temperatures increase the infection and spread it through the body, causing skin to rot and mutate. Eventually the victim is covered from head to toe in infectious sores. The victim is then declared clinically dead and reanimates after a while, and will attempt to infect anyone else they encounter. The Foundation has been trying to contain this disease, but they may be unsuccessful because of its fast contagion spread.\n|-\n|Skull shivers\n|''[[Borderlands (video game)|Borderlands]]''\n|\n|-\n|Stigma\n|''[[Trauma Center: New Blood]]''\n|A virus accidentally created by Markus Vaughn and Lloyd Wilkens. It is later used as a bioterror weapon by the group Parnassus. It comes in six strains, named after body parts it resembles or attacks (Cheir, Soma, Ops, Onyx, Brachion, Cardia). Unlike other pathogens, which store their genetic information in DNA, Stigma stores its genetic information in a film-like structure making it unique among pathogens. Due to the fact that Stigma originated from a lab rat with Culurium-based synthetic blood, a newly discovered mineral from the country of Culuruma, taking control of the mines that contain the mineral is necessary for the mass production of Stigma.\n|-\n|Syphon Filter\n|''[[Syphon Filter (series)|Syphon Filter series]]''\n|A bio-weapon that can be genetically programmable to terminate specific genotypes, killing only intended victims while leaving non-targeted parties alive''.'' Because it binds with each host's specific DNA, it does not possess a universal vaccine, and in order to cure it, one must know the specific genetic lock and key for each strain of the disease.\n|-\n|T-Abyss Virus\n|''[[Resident Evil]]'' series\n|A variant of the T-Virus, designed by FBC CEO Morgan Lansdale to show the world the dangers of bio-weapons and increase his own personal power through use of the 'Veltro' terrorist group. The virus crates zombies and BOWs who are strongly linked with water, and have numerous aquatic features such as tentacles and crab-like shells. It is encountered in the game when 'Veltro' threaten to infect the world's oceans, hoping to exact revenge for the loss of much of their forces during the bio-terrorist attack on the floating techno-utopia Terragrigia. It is encountered during exploration of three research vessals, where it has transformed the crew and several sea creatures into zombies, mutants and Tyrants.\n|-\n|T-Veronica Virus\n|''[[Resident Evil]]'' series\n|A powerful strain of the Progenitor Virus, created by combining it with a rare [[retrovirus]] found in the genetic make-up of ant queens, discovered by unstable scientific genius Alexia Ashford, the result of an advanced cloning experiment. It is encountered in ''[[Resident Evil Code: Veronica|Code: Veronica]]'', when it is being used by Alexia Ashford in her attempt to take control of the world. She experiments on her father, then on herself; her father is transformed into a terrifying monster, while she, going into hibernation after giving herself a dose of the Virus, manages to gain control over it and retain her personality and intelligence. She eventually becomes a dragonfly-like creature who has to be killed by [[Chris Redfield]]. It appears again in the 'Operation Javier' section of ''[[Resident Evil: Darkside Chronicles|Darkside Chronicles]]'', where it is being used by Javier Hidalgo to cure his daughter Manuela of an inherited illness. He also tried to cure his wife, but the virus overwhelmed her and turned her into a mutant. Manuela uses her developing powers (similar to Alexia Ashford's abilities before transforming into her insect form) to defeat the mutated Javier, and is then evacuated by [[Leon S. Kennedy|Leon Kennedy]] and [[Jack Krauser]]. If Manuela survives at the end of the game, it is said that she is cared for by the US government, but her ultimate fate is left unknown.\n|-{{anchor|T-Virus}}\n|T-Virus (Tyrant virus)\n|''[[Resident Evil]]'' series\n|A highly contagious virus, spread mostly through liquids such as bodily fluids and water, that causes cellular [[necrosis]] in humans and other animals, turning them into zombie-like creatures who are difficult to kill. It can easily mutate into other strains, some of which have mutagenic effects on the host. In insects or amphibians, the resulting mutation often involves increased aggressiveness, increased size, and (almost always) the development of poisonous traits. In mammals, the results include aggressiveness, physiological changes of varying degrees, and an extremely increased evolutionary rate. However, it is shown that some humans can bond with the T-Virus and its variants and gain heightened speed, strength and strange powers while retaining their personalities, as in the case of [[Albert Wesker]] and [[Alexia Ashford]]. Variants include the [[Nemesis (Resident Evil)|NE-T virus]], along with many others.\n|-\n|Technocyte Virus (The Infestation)\n|''[[Warframe]]''\n|The Technocyte virus mutates both flesh and metal alike. It disfigures and dismembers anybody it infects, turning them into a raging and mindless creature. These infected entities and the virus itself make up a faction known as the \"Infestation.\" Notable infested entities include Lephantis, Jordas Golem, and Phorid. The virus itself can take over something as insignificant as a simple drone to an entire Corpus Obelisk. \n|-\n|Tiberium poisoning\n|''[[Command & Conquer]]''\n|Tiberium crystals start to grow on a person's skin. These skin crystals eventually force their way through the persons vital organs, killing them. If the infestation is in a certain proportion, the victim mutates into a living bag of rotten skin and organs, called a visceroid.\n|-\n|Turbo Cancer\n|''[[Borderlands (video game)|Borderlands]]''\n|-\n|Unicornitis\n|''[[Octodad: Dadliest Catch]]''\n|A disease made up during a story told by Tommy and Stacy in the bonus episode \"Medical Mess\". Symptoms include a bright pink unicorn horn magically sprouting from the forehead, and the ability to fly. The only known cure is to purchase and use a set of jet-skis. Notable victims include Patient 203 and Octodad.\n|-\n|Uroboros\n|''[[Resident Evil]]'' series\n|An advanced strain of the Progenitor virus, the Uroboros virus was created by Albert Wesker, with inadvertent help from Jill Valentine. Exposure to Uroboros can lead to one of two things\u2014forced evolution via DNA integration, leading to extremely heightened abilities, or rejection via the virus, leading to the parasitic nature taking over and forming a mass of black, leech-like pustules, which can grow in size if exposed to more organic matters. The only individual known to survive the process was Albert Wesker, which was more than likely due to the fact of his previous exposure to the T-virus. Other beings that took positive mutations from the Uroboros virus include the Reapers; cockroaches exposed accidentally to the virus, who then in turn grew largely in size, gained armour-like carapaces and scythe-like appendages, explaining the name.\n|-\n|Wailing Death\n|''[[Neverwinter Nights]]''\n|A bubonic-like plague that infects almost the entire city of Neverwinter. Thought to be just a natural plague, it is later discovered that it was magically created and unleashed upon the city.\n|-\n|X-2 Virus\n|''[[BattleTanx]]'', ''[[BattleTanx: Global Assault]]''\n|An extremely deadly virus released in 2001 and further researched in 2006 that killed 99.9% of the world's human female population that did not possess a special psychic ability known as 'The Edge'.  Those that were spared were treated with the utmost respect, authority, and loyalty, thereby earning their title of 'Queenlord'.\n|-\n|Yellow Death\n|''[[Ben Croshaw#1213 series|1213]]''\n|A deadly virus which contaminated the entire planet Earth and certain parts of the Tessa Life Orbital. Humans are killed in short time upon infection, but cloned humans are transformed into killer zombies. When 0916 got a large dosage of the virus he mutated into a yellow, four-armed monster with two retractable spines and tentacles. 1213 however was unaffected by the virus due to a successful [[Immunization]] to the virus.\n|-\n|Twin Fever\n|''[[Metroid Prime]]''\n|A Virus native to Twin Tabula causing double vision. When the twin sight fades, the victim is near death.\n|-\n|''Kuru'' {{clarify|date=July 2015}}\n|''[[Dead Island]], [[Dead Island: Riptide|Dead Island Riptide]]'', ''[[Dead Island 2]]''\n| Is a sub-type version of Kuru which later actually revealing is neuro-genetically engineered version of Kuru that infected islands to the Papua New Guinea region. It is widely passed among the local tribes and is believed to be the cause of the zombie outbreak. Doctor West needs a non-mutated strain of this disease to work on a cure. Doctor West also believes that people with O Negative blood are unsusceptible to the infection\n|-\n|Tuurngait Virus\n|''[[Penumbra: Black Plague]]''\n|The Tuurngait Virus is a disease that can affect humans and animals, it was later discovered by the Archaic led by Philip's father Howard LaFresque and his crew members in Greenland. It was later tested and found out that one of its effects is mutation.\n|}\n\n== In role playing games ==\n<!-- PLEASE NOTE: Only additions of nonexistent, named medical conditions which appear in fiction where they have a major plot or thematic importance are welcome, if unsure ask on the talk page first-->\n<!-- Please do [[wikilink]] to the relevant *medical* concepts -->\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Name\n!Source\n!Symptoms\n|-\n|Goblin Fever\n|''[[Dungeon Adventures]] #46'', \"Goblin Fever\"\n|This disease is a relatively harmless ailment to goblins, orcs, and similar creatures, but it is rare. To humans, it is much deadlier. Having a long incubation period and being highly contagious, an outbreak can start before the first case is even detected. The disease causes deterioration of the central nervous system, causing forgetfulness and rapid mood swings, the victim often becoming violent, depressed, or even suicidal, eventually lapsing into a coma before dying.\n|-\n|Free League Plague\n|''[[Planescape]]''\n|A plague created by the Lady of Pain to keep the swelling numbers of the Free League in check, which grew to an overwhelming size after a conflict called the Great Upheaval amongst the factions, where the Lady of Pain decreed that there could only be fifteen Factions in Sigil at one time. Very little is known about this disease, but any member of the Free League stood a chance of becoming infected with it simply by entering Sigil.\n|-\n|Magical Diseases\n|''[[Dungeons and Dragons]]''\n|The setting has several of varying degrees of lethality, most of them affecting one or more Ability Scores. The most well known are Devil Chills, Cackle Fever, Filth Fever, Mummy Rot, and Slimy Doom.\n|-\n|Slarecian Language Virus\n|''[[Scarred Lands]]''\n|This odd affliction can infect anyone who tries to use magic or even rudimentary means to decipher the language of the Slarecian, an extinct species of evil sorcerers, if the work they are trying to decipher has this specific taint. An infected victim's language is changed to that of the Slarecians (which is gibberish to most natives of Scarn), meaning he can only understand or be understood by another infected victim, and all written language other than Slarecian makes no sense to him. Victims do not realize what has happened to them, as what they say sounds clear to them. The disease is incredibly contagious; anyone who listens to an infected victim risks also becoming infected. \n|-\n|Ravenloft Viruses\n|''[[Ravenloft]] Monstrous Compendium Appendix III: Creatures of Darkness''\n|These six magical diseases were created by an evil wizard who was killed by his six sons, who each became the first carrier of one of them: Combustion (the victim experiences a horrible fever and eventually bursts into flames), Crystal (the victim's blood crystallizes from within), Petrification (the victim gradually turns to stone) Phobia (the victim becomes terrified of everything), Psionic (the victim rapidly gains intelligence and psionic powers until their head explodes) and Shadow (the victim eventually fades into darkness). \n|-\n|Vile Diseases\n|''[[Book of Vile Darkness]]''\n|The book mentions seventeen diseases of varying lethality caused by evil magic or exposure to focal points of incredible evil. The most notorious ones are Faceless Hate (causes the victim's face to vanish, and drives him to a violent, insane rage), Life Blindness (the victim is unable to see, hear, or otherwise perceive any other living thing, and is often driven mad from isolation and loneliness), and Vile Rigidity (the victim becomes stronger and tougher, but eventually, their skin hardens, until they can't move and suffocates).\n|-\n|Knahaten Flu\n|''[[The Elder Scrolls]]''\n|The Knahaten Flu (also known as the Knahaten Plague) was one of the deadliest diseases to infect the populace of Tamriel, lasting for 43 years. Though exactly how the disease was introduced is unknown, it started in the swamps of Black Marsh. Argonians, the denizens of Black Marsh, were immune to the disease, leading to speculation about its source, but it did not take long for it to sweep through the rest of the continent. There is no definitive death toll of the disease. However, the Flu almost completely destroyed the non-Argonian population of Black Marsh, and killed vast swathes of the population of Tamriel. The exact method of transmission is unclear. Early symptoms of the Flu include \"general malaise, loss of appetite, and fatigue,\" followed shortly by aching muscles, sharp pain in the shoulders, chills, and watering eyes. Late-stage symptoms include wracking cough, high fever, and blood flowing out of the nose, eyes and eventually the mouth. Victims rarely survived longer than a few days.\n|-\n|Virally-Induced Toxic Allergy Syndrome (VITAS)\n|''[[Shadowrun]]''\n|Caused by a highly lethal and communicable airborne virus, VITAS is the disease responsible for many of the changes that led to what became the Sixth World in the Shadowrun universe, having killed a quarter of the world's population after its outbreak in 2011. A second strain (VITAS II) broke out in the 2020s, killing an additional 10%. Symptoms begin 12 hours after infection and begin with symptoms similar to influenza before developing into severe anaphylaxis leading to death usually by the airways swelling shut. Though treatable with modern drugs, at the initial outbreak of VITAS over 75% of the world's population became infected before a cure was discovered.\n|-\n|Human-Metahuman Vampiric Virus (HMHVV)\n|''[[Shadowrun]]''\n|A mutagenic retrovirus that achieves its full virulence and power only in a magic-rich environment\u2014such as post-Awakening Earth. The virus itself has existed throughout history and even expressed in very rare instances during the relatively magic-poor Fifth World. When a metahuman\u2019s immune system fails to stave off infection, the virus begins to systematically re-shape their auras and genetic code\u2014transforming them into forms reminiscent of the night-stalking monsters of legend. The specific form that the subject takes is dependent on their original genetic form and the strain of the virus they contract.\n|-\n|White Fever\n|''[[Ravenloft]]''\n|A disease that is usually unique to the Core Domain of Valachan. Symptoms include weakness, exhaustion, chills, and loss of strength. Magical remedies cannot cure it, but conventional medicine can hasten recovery. In truth, \"white fever\" is one of many hoaxes orchestrated by Valachan's ruler, Baron Urik von Kharkov, in order to hide his true nature from his subjects. The illness is actually caused by the vampiric feeding of the Baron and his servants.\n|-\n|Blorbs\n|''[[Mario & Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story]]''\n|A mysterious disease that causes a toad to grow large and round renedering them mostly immobile and can make roll uncontrollably.\n|-\n|Green Poison (Dollar Flu)\n|''[[Tom Clancy's The Division]]''\n|A bio-weapon created by Dr Gordon Amherst, as a mean of controlling population. With a strain of [[Dengue]], [[Smallpox]], [[Swineflu]], [[H1N1]], [[Ebola]], [[Hantavirus]] and [[Marburg Virus]]. Comparing to the original smallpox virus, not only does it incubates faster, it is also infectious during its incubation period. Due to its rapid mutation, it is extremely difficult for antibodies and drugs to identify the virus and exterminate them as well as creating vaccine to this disease.\n|}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* '' Disease in Fiction.

It also acquired the names International Christian Leadership (ICL), Fellowship House, and International Foundation for venues as its global outreach ministry expanded.<ref name=Wheaton459 /><ref>{{citation|publisher=ILSOS|url=http://www.ilsos.gov/corporatellc/CorporateLlcController|title=Certificate of Good Standing|place=USA}}</ref> The Fellowship Foundation, Inc. does most of its business as the International Foundation,<ref name=ShowingFaith/> which is its [[Doing business as|DBA]] name.<ref name=Fellow990-2007/>\n\nBy 1942 there were 60 breakfast groups in major cities around the US and Canada, including Chicago, Los Angeles, Minneapolis, New York, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Washington and Vancouver. That same year, Vereide began to hold small prayer breakfasts for members of the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] and the [[U.S. Senate]].\n\nIn 1942, the Fellowship was incorporated in Chicago, Illinois as Vereide's center of national outreach to businessmen and civic and clergy leadership. Vereide had moved the group's offices from Seattle to the more centralized location of Chicago, headquarters of the businessmen's luncheon outreach \"Christian Businessmen's Committee\", which Vereide led with industrialist C.B. Hedstrom. That same year the Fellowship Foundation established a delegation ministry in Washington DC on Massachusetts Avenue at Sheridan Circle named \"Fellowship House\". Vereide later described it as the nerve center of the breakfast groups.\n\nIn 1944, Vereide held his first joint Senate\u2013House prayer breakfast meeting. He held another breakfast on June 16, 1946, attended by Senators [[H. Alexander Smith]] and [[Lister Hill]], and ''[[US News and World Report]]'' publisher [[David Lawrence (publisher)|David Lawrence]].\n\nIn 1946, Vereide wrote and released a book with Reverend John G. Magee, chaplain to President [[Harry Truman]], entitled ''Together'' (Abingdon Cokesbury). In the book, Vereide explained his philosophy of visionary discipleship and gathering together in what he termed spiritual cells:\n\n<blockquote>Man craves fellowship. Most of us want an opportunity to make our feelings known, to relate our personal experiences, to compare notes with others, and, in unity of spirit to receive renewal, inspiration, guidance, and strength from God. Such groups as we are thinking of have characterized every spiritual awakening. Jesus began with Peter and James and John. He had the twelve and the Seventy. At Bethany he established a cell... there you have the formula... faith embodied the same close informal fellowship... one common practice\u2014gathering together in the name of Jesus.</blockquote>\n\nIn January 1947, a conference in Zurich led to the formation of the International Council for Christian Leadership (ICCL), an umbrella group for the national fellowship groups in the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Great Britain]], [[Norway]], [[Hungary]], [[Egypt]] and [[China]]. ICCL was incorporated as a separate organization in 1953. ICL and ICCL were governed by different boards of directors, joined by a coordinating committee: four members of ICCL's board and four from the ICL's executive committee.\n\nIn 1953, President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] attended the Senate Prayer Breakfast Group. He was invited by fellow Kansan [[Frank Carlson]]. By that time, Vereide's congressional members also included Senators [[Frank Carlson]], [[Karl Mundt]], [[Everett Dirksen]] and [[Strom Thurmond]].\n\nBy 1957, ICL had established 125 groups in 100 cities, with 16 groups in Washington, D.C. alone. It had set up another 125 groups in other countries. During 1958, a mentor from [[The Navigators (organization)|The Navigators]], [[Douglas Coe]],<ref>Modern Viking, page 128</ref><ref>Window On Washington, page 28</ref> joined Vereide as assistant executive director of ICL in Washington, D.C. After over 35 years of leading the Fellowship Foundation, Vereide died in 1969 and was succeeded by [[Richard C. Halverson]] as executive director. Halverson and Coe worked side by side until Halverson's death in 1995.\n\n==Influence==\nProminent evangelical Christians have described the Fellowship as one of the most, or the most, politically well-connected ministries in the world.\n\n[[D. Michael Lindsay]], a former [[Rice University]] sociologist who studies the evangelical movement, said \"there is no other organization like the Fellowship, especially among religious groups, in terms of its access or clout among the country's leadership.\"<ref name=\"LindsayP35\"/> He also reported that lawmakers mentioned the Fellowship more than any other organization when asked to name a ministry with the most influence on their faith.<ref name=AllInFamily/> Lindsay interviewed 360 evangelical elites, among whom \"One in three mentioned [Doug] Coe or the Fellowship as an important influence.\"<ref name=\"LindsayP35\"/>   Lindsay reported that it \"has relationships with pretty much every world leader\u2014good and bad\u2014and there are not many organizations in the world that can claim that.\"<ref name=AllInFamily/>\n\nIn 1977, four years after he had converted to Christianity, Fellowship member and Watergate conspirator [[Charles Colson]] described the group as a \"veritable underground of Christ's men all through the U.S. government.\"<ref name=\"ColsonBornAgain\"/>\n\nFormer Kansas Governor [[Sam Brownback]], also a former member of the Senate Prayer Group, has described Fellowship members' method of operation: \"Typically, one person grows desirous of pursuing an action\"\u2014a piece of legislation, a diplomatic strategy\u2014\"and the others pull in behind.\"<ref name=\"SharletP264t5\">Jeff Sharlet, The Family (Harper, 2008), pp. 264\u20135.</ref> Brownback has often joined with fellow Family members in pursuing legislation. For example, in 1999 he joined together with fellow Family members, Senators [[Strom Thurmond]] and [[Don Nickles]] to demand a criminal investigation of [[Americans United for the Separation of Church and State]], and in 2005 Brownback joined with Fellowship member Sen. [[Tom Coburn]] to promote the Houses of Worship Act.<ref name=\"SharletP265\">Jeff Sharlet, The Family (Harper, 2008), p. 265.</ref>\n\n[[Rob Schenck]], founder of the Washington, D.C. ministry [[Faith and Action|Faith and Action in the Nation's Capital]], described the Family's influence as \"off the charts\" in comparison with other fundamentalist groups, specifically compared to [[Focus on the Family]], [[Pat Robertson]], [[Gary Bauer]], [[Traditional Values Coalition]], and [[Prison Fellowship]].<ref name=\"SharletP259\"/> (These last two are associated with the Family: Traditional Values Coalition uses their C Street House<ref name=\"SharletP259\"/> and Prison Fellowship was founded by [[Charles Colson]].) Schenck also says that \"the mystique of the Fellowship\" has helped it \"gain entree into almost impossible places in the capital.\"<ref name=ShowingFaith/>\n\n\"The Fellowship's reach into governments around the world is almost impossible to overstate or even grasp,\" says [[David Kuo (author)|David Kuo]], a former special assistant in George W. Bush's [[Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives]].<ref name=\"SharletP25\"/>\n\n==Beliefs and theology==\nThe Fellowship Foundation's [[501(c)(3)]] mission statement is:\n\n{{quote|To develop and maintain an informal association of people banded together, to go out as \"ambassadors of reconciliation,\" modeling the principles of Jesus, based on loving God and loving others.

It also acquired the names International Christian Leadership (ICL), Fellowship House, and International Foundation for venues as its global outreach ministry expanded.<ref name=Wheaton459 /><ref>{{citation|publisher=ILSOS|url=http://www.ilsos.gov/corporatellc/CorporateLlcController|title=Certificate of Good Standing|place=USA}}</ref> The Fellowship Foundation, Inc. does most of its business as the International Foundation,<ref name=ShowingFaith/> which is its [[Doing business as|DBA]] name.<ref name=Fellow990-2007/>\n\nBy 1942 there were 60 breakfast groups in major cities around the US and Canada, including Chicago, Los Angeles, Minneapolis, New York, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Washington and Vancouver. That same year, Vereide began to hold small prayer breakfasts for members of the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] and the [[U.S. Senate]].\n\nIn 1942, the Fellowship was incorporated in Chicago, Illinois as Vereide's center of national outreach to businessmen and civic and clergy leadership. Vereide had moved the group's offices from Seattle to the more centralized location of Chicago, headquarters of the businessmen's luncheon outreach \"Christian Businessmen's Committee\", which Vereide led with industrialist C.B. Hedstrom. That same year the Fellowship Foundation established a delegation ministry in Washington DC on Massachusetts Avenue at Sheridan Circle named \"Fellowship House\". Vereide later described it as the nerve center of the breakfast groups.\n\nIn 1944, Vereide held his first joint Senate\u2013House prayer breakfast meeting. He held another breakfast on June 16, 1946, attended by Senators [[H. Alexander Smith]] and [[Lister Hill]], and ''[[US News and World Report]]'' publisher [[David Lawrence (publisher)|David Lawrence]].\n\nIn 1946, Vereide wrote and released a book with Reverend John G. Magee, chaplain to President [[Harry Truman]], entitled ''Together'' (Abingdon Cokesbury). In the book, Vereide explained his philosophy of visionary discipleship and gathering together in what he termed spiritual cells:\n\n<blockquote>Man craves fellowship. Most of us want an opportunity to make our feelings known, to relate our personal experiences, to compare notes with others, and, in unity of spirit to receive renewal, inspiration, guidance, and strength from God. Such groups as we are thinking of have characterized every spiritual awakening. Jesus began with Peter and James and John. He had the twelve and the Seventy. At Bethany he established a cell... there you have the formula... faith embodied the same close informal fellowship... one common practice\u2014gathering together in the name of Jesus.</blockquote>\n\nIn January 1947, a conference in Zurich led to the formation of the International Council for Christian Leadership (ICCL), an umbrella group for the national fellowship groups in the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Great Britain]], [[Norway]], [[Hungary]], [[Egypt]] and [[China]]. ICCL was incorporated as a separate organization in 1953. ICL and ICCL were governed by different boards of directors, joined by a coordinating committee: four members of ICCL's board and four from the ICL's executive committee.\n\nIn 1953, President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] attended the Senate Prayer Breakfast Group. He was invited by fellow Kansan [[Frank Carlson]]. By that time, Vereide's congressional members also included Senators [[Frank Carlson]], [[Karl Mundt]], [[Everett Dirksen]] and [[Strom Thurmond]].\n\nBy 1957, ICL had established 125 groups in 100 cities, with 16 groups in Washington, D.C. alone. It had set up another 125 groups in other countries. During 1958, a mentor from [[The Navigators (organization)|The Navigators]], [[Douglas Coe]],<ref>Modern Viking, page 128</ref><ref>Window On Washington, page 28</ref> joined Vereide as assistant executive director of ICL in Washington, D.C. After over 35 years of leading the Fellowship Foundation, Vereide died in 1969 and was succeeded by [[Richard C. Halverson]] as executive director. Halverson and Coe worked side by side until Halverson's death in 1995.\n\n==Influence==\nProminent evangelical Christians have described the Fellowship as one of the most, or the most, politically well-connected ministries in the world.\n\n[[D. Michael Lindsay]], a former [[Rice University]] sociologist who studies the evangelical movement, said \"there is no other organization like the Fellowship, especially among religious groups, in terms of its access or clout among the country's leadership.\"<ref name=\"LindsayP35\"/> He also reported that lawmakers mentioned the Fellowship more than any other organization when asked to name a ministry with the most influence on their faith.<ref name=AllInFamily/> Lindsay interviewed 360 evangelical elites, among whom \"One in three mentioned [Doug] Coe or the Fellowship as an important influence.\"<ref name=\"LindsayP35\"/>   Lindsay reported that it \"has relationships with pretty much every world leader\u2014good and bad\u2014and there are not many organizations in the world that can claim that.\"<ref name=AllInFamily/>\n\nIn 1977, four years after he had converted to Christianity, Fellowship member and Watergate conspirator [[Charles Colson]] described the group as a \"veritable underground of Christ's men all through the U.S. government.\"<ref name=\"ColsonBornAgain\"/>\n\nFormer Kansas Governor [[Sam Brownback]], also a former member of the Senate Prayer Group, has described Fellowship members' method of operation: \"Typically, one person grows desirous of pursuing an action\"\u2014a piece of legislation, a diplomatic strategy\u2014\"and the others pull in behind.\"<ref name=\"SharletP264t5\">Jeff Sharlet, The Family (Harper, 2008), pp. 264\u20135.</ref> Brownback has often joined with fellow Family members in pursuing legislation. For example, in 1999 he joined together with fellow Family members, Senators [[Strom Thurmond]] and [[Don Nickles]] to demand a criminal investigation of [[Americans United for the Separation of Church and State]], and in 2005 Brownback joined with Fellowship member Sen. [[Tom Coburn]] to promote the Houses of Worship Act.<ref name=\"SharletP265\">Jeff Sharlet, The Family (Harper, 2008), p. 265.</ref>\n\n[[Rob Schenck]], founder of the Washington, D.C. ministry [[Faith and Action|Faith and Action in the Nation's Capital]], described the Family's influence as \"off the charts\" in comparison with other fundamentalist groups, specifically compared to [[Focus on the Family]], [[Pat Robertson]], [[Gary Bauer]], [[Traditional Values Coalition]], and [[Prison Fellowship]].<ref name=\"SharletP259\"/> (These last two are associated with the Family: Traditional Values Coalition uses their C Street House<ref name=\"SharletP259\"/> and Prison Fellowship was founded by [[Charles Colson]].) Schenck also says that \"the mystique of the Fellowship\" has helped it \"gain entree into almost impossible places in the capital.\"<ref name=ShowingFaith/>\n\n\"The Fellowship's reach into governments around the world is almost impossible to overstate or even grasp,\" says [[David Kuo (author)|David Kuo]], a former special assistant in George W. Bush's [[Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives]].<ref name=\"SharletP25\"/>\n\n==Beliefs and theology==\nThe Fellowship Foundation's [[501(c)(3)]] mission statement is:\n\n{{quote|To develop and maintain an informal association of people banded together, to go out as \"ambassadors of reconciliation,\" modeling the principles of Jesus, based on loving God and loving others.

Znamenny Chant is [[unison]], [[melisma]]tic [[liturgy|liturgical]] singing that has its own specific notation, called the ''stolp'' notation.  The symbols used in the stolp notation are called ''{{transl|ru|kryuki|links=no}}'' ({{lang-ru|\u043a\u0440\u044e\u043a\u0438|links=no}}, 'hooks') or ''{{transl|ru|znamena}}'' ({{lang-ru|\u0437\u043d\u0430\u043c\u0451\u043d\u0430|links=no}}, 'signs').  Often the names of the signs are used to refer to the stolp notation.  Znamenny melodies are part of a system, consisting of Eight Tones (intonation structures; called glasy); the melodies are characterized by fluency and well-balancedness {{harv|Kholopov|2003|loc=192}}. There exist several types of Znamenny Chant: the so-called ''Stolpovoy'', ''Malyj'' (Little) and ''Bolshoy'' (Great) Znamenny Chant.  Ruthenian Chant ([[Prostopinije]]) is sometimes considered a sub-division of the Znamenny Chant tradition, with the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow|Muscovite]] Chant (Znamenny Chant proper) being the second branch of the same musical continuum.\n\n==Notation==\nZnamenny Chants are not written with notes (the so-called linear notation), but with special signs, called ''Znam\u00ebna'' (Russian for \"marks\", \"banners\") or ''Kryuki'' (\"hooks\"), as some shapes of these signs resemble hooks. Each sign may include the following components: a large black hook or a black stroke, several smaller black 'points' and 'commas' and lines near the hook or crossing the hook. Some signs may mean only one note, some 2 to 4 notes, and some a whole melody of more than 10 notes with a complicated rhythmic structure. [[Image:Kryuki.jpg|thumb|200px|A hand-drawn [[lubok]] featuring 'hook and banner notation'.]]\n\nThe stolp notation was developed in [[Kievan Rus']] as an [[East Slavs|East Slavic]] refinement of the [[Byzantine music|Byzantine]] [[neumatic]] musical notation.\n\nThe most notable feature of this notation system is that it records transitions of the melody, rather than [[Musical note|note]]s. The signs also represent a mood and a gradation of how this part of melody is to be sung (tempo, strength, devotion, meekness, etc.) Every sign has its own name and also features as a spiritual symbol. For example, there is a specific sign, called \"little dove\" (Russian: \u0433\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0431\u0447\u0438\u043a ''(golubchik)''), which represents two rising sounds, but which is also a symbol of the [[Holy Ghost]].\n\nAfter the fall of Kievan Rus' to the [[Mongols]], the Znamenny Chant and stolp notation continued to develop to the North (particularly in [[Novgorod]]), where it flourished and was adopted throughout the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]].\n\nGradually the system became more and more complicated. This system was also ambiguous, so that almost no one, except the most trained and educated singers, could sing an unknown melody at sight. The signs only helped to reproduce the melody, not coding it in an unambiguous way.\n\nBecause of the complexity of the system, a simplification was developed by Ivan Shaidurov around 1600,<ref>Velimirovic, Milos. \"The Present status of Research in Slavic Chant\". ''Acta Musicologica''. Vol. 44, Fasc. 2 (Jul. - Dec., 1972), pp. 251</ref> called \"red marks\" (Russian: \u043a\u0438\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0440\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0437\u043d\u0430\u043a\u0438 (''kinovarnye znaki'')), which consisted of small letters in red and which were placed before each Znamenny sign. These indicate the highest note of the sign it stands before. This is generally regarded as the first step towards a certain simplification of the system.\n\nThe use and evolution of the system stopped in the middle of the 17th century, after the [[raskol|church reforms]] by [[Patriarch Nikon]].

Znamenny performance practice excludes classical vocal training.  Singers perform with their own, natural voices, sometimes in a style reminiscent of folk music. Znamenny Chant does not have any pauses or rests, and all chants are performed fluently. Ideally, singers will sing in such a way that their voices become united in one single voice.   \nOriginally Znamenny Chant was performed only by male voices. Today, on account of the small number of people able to sing at church services and the evolution of the tradition, it is usually performed by both male and female voices.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n* {{wikicite|ref={{harvid|Kholopov|2003}}|reference=[[Yuri Kholopov|Kholopov, Yuri]] (2003).

Znamenny Chant is [[unison]], [[melisma]]tic [[liturgy|liturgical]] singing that has its own specific notation, called the ''stolp'' notation.  The symbols used in the stolp notation are called ''{{transl|ru|kryuki|links=no}}'' ({{lang-ru|\u043a\u0440\u044e\u043a\u0438|links=no}}, 'hooks') or ''{{transl|ru|znamena}}'' ({{lang-ru|\u0437\u043d\u0430\u043c\u0451\u043d\u0430|links=no}}, 'signs').  Often the names of the signs are used to refer to the stolp notation.  Znamenny melodies are part of a system, consisting of Eight Tones (intonation structures; called glasy); the melodies are characterized by fluency and well-balancedness {{harv|Kholopov|2003|loc=192}}. There exist several types of Znamenny Chant: the so-called ''Stolpovoy'', ''Malyj'' (Little) and ''Bolshoy'' (Great) Znamenny Chant.  Ruthenian Chant ([[Prostopinije]]) is sometimes considered a sub-division of the Znamenny Chant tradition, with the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow|Muscovite]] Chant (Znamenny Chant proper) being the second branch of the same musical continuum.\n\n==Notation==\nZnamenny Chants are not written with notes (the so-called linear notation), but with special signs, called ''Znam\u00ebna'' (Russian for \"marks\", \"banners\") or ''Kryuki'' (\"hooks\"), as some shapes of these signs resemble hooks. Each sign may include the following components: a large black hook or a black stroke, several smaller black 'points' and 'commas' and lines near the hook or crossing the hook. Some signs may mean only one note, some 2 to 4 notes, and some a whole melody of more than 10 notes with a complicated rhythmic structure. [[Image:Kryuki.jpg|thumb|200px|A hand-drawn [[lubok]] featuring 'hook and banner notation'.]]\n\nThe stolp notation was developed in [[Kievan Rus']] as an [[East Slavs|East Slavic]] refinement of the [[Byzantine music|Byzantine]] [[neumatic]] musical notation.\n\nThe most notable feature of this notation system is that it records transitions of the melody, rather than [[Musical note|note]]s. The signs also represent a mood and a gradation of how this part of melody is to be sung (tempo, strength, devotion, meekness, etc.) Every sign has its own name and also features as a spiritual symbol. For example, there is a specific sign, called \"little dove\" (Russian: \u0433\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0431\u0447\u0438\u043a ''(golubchik)''), which represents two rising sounds, but which is also a symbol of the [[Holy Ghost]].\n\nAfter the fall of Kievan Rus' to the [[Mongols]], the Znamenny Chant and stolp notation continued to develop to the North (particularly in [[Novgorod]]), where it flourished and was adopted throughout the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]].\n\nGradually the system became more and more complicated. This system was also ambiguous, so that almost no one, except the most trained and educated singers, could sing an unknown melody at sight. The signs only helped to reproduce the melody, not coding it in an unambiguous way.\n\nBecause of the complexity of the system, a simplification was developed by Ivan Shaidurov around 1600,<ref>Velimirovic, Milos. \"The Present status of Research in Slavic Chant\". ''Acta Musicologica''. Vol. 44, Fasc. 2 (Jul. - Dec., 1972), pp. 251</ref> called \"red marks\" (Russian: \u043a\u0438\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0440\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0437\u043d\u0430\u043a\u0438 (''kinovarnye znaki'')), which consisted of small letters in red and which were placed before each Znamenny sign. These indicate the highest note of the sign it stands before. This is generally regarded as the first step towards a certain simplification of the system.\n\nThe use and evolution of the system stopped in the middle of the 17th century, after the [[raskol|church reforms]] by [[Patriarch Nikon]]. From that time Western music started to penetrate into Russian culture, and the Russian-Orthodox Church introduced a \"Latin\", polyphonic way of singing, based on Polish, German and Italian harmonies. The term \"Latin\" however was considered derogatory, since it also referred to \"heretical Latin faith\".  Znamenny Chant, however, has been preserved to a certain degree in the chanting traditions that are directly descended from it.\n\n[[File:\u0424\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0440 \u041a\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c\u044f\u043d\u0438\u043d. \u0421\u0442\u0438\u0445\u0438\u0440\u0430 \u0415\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0433\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u0430\u044f, \u0433\u043b\u0430\u0441 1. \u0420\u0430\u0441\u0448\u0438\u0444\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043a\u0430 \u0411\u0440\u0430\u0436\u043d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0430 \u041c. \u0412..ogg|thumb|left|Fyodor Krestianin (i.e. Christian).

His daughter, Lavinia, takes up [[Wicca]] and performs rituals in hopes of restoring her mother's health.  One of these rituals is interrupted by the arrival of Ward, a hydrologist, surveying the water table in planning for a hydroelectric dam.\n\nThe family is strained by the move - Theresa, a financial adviser, is losing clients because she cannot get a reliable internet signal in their remote location; Nathan feels neglected because they have not had sex since her surgery six months ago and the rest of his family does not take his attempts at farming seriously; his son Benny hangs around with Ezra, a local hermit, and has started smoking pot; his youngest son Jack is withdrawn and only interacts with their family dog, Sam.\n\nOne night, Nathan convinces Theresa that despite her feelings of mutilation she is still attractive, and they begin to have sex, but they are interrupted when a brilliantly glowing meteor crash lands in their front yard.  The rock emits an unearthly Color which distorts the world around it and causes Nathan to detect a horrific smell.  The next morning, the meteor is no longer glowing and is crumbling to dust. Ward, along with the mayor and the sheriff of the nearby town of [[Arkham]] arrive to see it. Later, Nathan and Lavinia witness the meteor being struck by several bolts of lightning.\n  \nWard notices that the groundwater has taken on an oily sheen and tests it.  When his test strips begin to glow brightly with the Color, he advises the Gardners not to drink it, but he cannot persuade the mayor to do anything since she does not want to scare off the dam developers.\n\nJack becomes obsessed with a well which stands a few feet from where the meteor landed.  Strange, brightly colored vegetation begins growing around it, mutated insects fly out of it, and Jack insists he can hear a man in there.  Ward visits Ezra, who plays a tape recording for him of what he says are people moving around underground.  A news crew arrives to interview Nathan about the meteor, but it has mysteriously vanished and Nathan comes off looking like a drunken fool.\n\nLater, while Theresa is preparing dinner, she absentmindedly cuts off two of her fingers.  While Nathan rushes her to the hospital, he leaves Benny in charge, but things quickly get out of hand as Benny finds the alpacas uncontrollable, Sam runs away and Jack is traumatized by something he saw in the well.  Nathan excoriates Benny and Lavinia, lashing out with uncharacteristic rage.  He tries to take a shower but is interrupted when a squid-like creature emerges from the drain.  The next day, after Nathan tries to harvest his tomatoes - which have all turned out misshapen and inedible - he and Theresa get into a fight when the internet goes out again and she loses a client.\n\nThe next night, Theresa hears Jack and Benny screaming in the barn and rushes to their aid.  To their horror, something awful has happened to the alpacas, and they try to flee the barn only to be struck by several bolts of Color lightning which fuses Theresa and Jack together into a single, deranged mass.  Unable to start the car or call for help as all electronic devices have stopped functioning, Nathan and the other children carry the monster into the attic where they struggle to decide what to do about the miserable, gibbering thing.  Nathan, enraged at what the Color has done to his family, gets a shotgun and enters the barn, where he finds all of his alpacas fused together, and he destroys the resulting creature.  He returns to the attic, orders his children to leave, and prepares to put down his mutated wife and son, but he cannot go through with it.\n\nLavinia tries to perform a Wiccan ceremony to save her family, mutilating herself in the process. She and Benny conspire to run away from the farm, but as they are preparing to leave, Benny hears Sam whining down in the well and insists on going down after him.  The Color bursts from the water and kills him, driving Lavinia insane.  Losing his grip on sanity, Nathan locks Lavinia in the attic with the monster, which has now grown aggressive and attacks her.  Ward and the sheriff arrive and break into the attic, and Nathan kills the creature, saying that he could no longer recognize it as his family.  As they exit the house, the Color erupts out of the well and drives Nathan insane.  He tries to shoot the Color, but the sheriff mistakes Nathan's aim for Ward and shoots Nathan, who dies in Lavinia's arms. Lavinia declares she will not leave, and neither will anyone else, because the Color will not allow it.\n\nStill intent on leaving, Ward and the sheriff go to pick up Ezra, but only find his desiccated corpse and a recording he left behind, where he surmises that the Color is attempting to remake Earth into \"something it knows.\"  The corpse implodes, raining Color down everywhere, while a now sentient tree ensnares Pierce and kills him by ramming a branch down his throat.\n\nWard arrives and attempts to rescue Lavinia, but the Color explodes from the well and roars into the sky in a towering funnel. Lavinia touches him and shares with him her vision of where the Color hails from \u2013 a horrific sector of outer space inhabited by [[Great Old Ones|disturbing, tentacled alien entities similar to itself]] \u2013 and as he is traumatized, she dissolves into dust from her corruption. Attempting to save himself, Ward hides in the farmhouse, where space and time begin to unravel around him as he is confronted by jumbled visions of the Gardner family, and attacked by a murderous apparition of Nathan speaking in all of the family's voices, and narrowly hides in the wine cellar as the Color vanishes into the sky, tearing down the house and leaving the surrounding farmland a \"blasted heath\", covered in ash and drained of all color and life except for Ward himself.\n\nIn an epilogue, a traumatized Ward stands on top of the finished dam, and says that knowing what he knows about this place, he will never drink its water, and affirming his fear that more [[Outer Gods| beings]] like the Color may find their way to Earth as well.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Nicolas Cage]] as Nathan Gardner\n* [[Joely Richardson]] as Theresa Gardner\n* [[Madeleine Arthur]] as Lavinia Gardner\n* [[Brendan Meyer]] as Benny Gardner\n* Julian Hilliard as Jack Gardner\n* [[Elliot Knight]] as Ward Phillips\n* [[Q'orianka Kilcher]] as Mayor Tooma\n* [[Tommy Chong]] as Ezra\n* Josh C.

His daughter, Lavinia, takes up [[Wicca]] and performs rituals in hopes of restoring her mother's health.  One of these rituals is interrupted by the arrival of Ward, a hydrologist, surveying the water table in planning for a hydroelectric dam.\n\nThe family is strained by the move - Theresa, a financial adviser, is losing clients because she cannot get a reliable internet signal in their remote location; Nathan feels neglected because they have not had sex since her surgery six months ago and the rest of his family does not take his attempts at farming seriously; his son Benny hangs around with Ezra, a local hermit, and has started smoking pot; his youngest son Jack is withdrawn and only interacts with their family dog, Sam.\n\nOne night, Nathan convinces Theresa that despite her feelings of mutilation she is still attractive, and they begin to have sex, but they are interrupted when a brilliantly glowing meteor crash lands in their front yard.  The rock emits an unearthly Color which distorts the world around it and causes Nathan to detect a horrific smell.  The next morning, the meteor is no longer glowing and is crumbling to dust. Ward, along with the mayor and the sheriff of the nearby town of [[Arkham]] arrive to see it. Later, Nathan and Lavinia witness the meteor being struck by several bolts of lightning.\n  \nWard notices that the groundwater has taken on an oily sheen and tests it.  When his test strips begin to glow brightly with the Color, he advises the Gardners not to drink it, but he cannot persuade the mayor to do anything since she does not want to scare off the dam developers.\n\nJack becomes obsessed with a well which stands a few feet from where the meteor landed.  Strange, brightly colored vegetation begins growing around it, mutated insects fly out of it, and Jack insists he can hear a man in there.  Ward visits Ezra, who plays a tape recording for him of what he says are people moving around underground.  A news crew arrives to interview Nathan about the meteor, but it has mysteriously vanished and Nathan comes off looking like a drunken fool.\n\nLater, while Theresa is preparing dinner, she absentmindedly cuts off two of her fingers.  While Nathan rushes her to the hospital, he leaves Benny in charge, but things quickly get out of hand as Benny finds the alpacas uncontrollable, Sam runs away and Jack is traumatized by something he saw in the well.  Nathan excoriates Benny and Lavinia, lashing out with uncharacteristic rage.  He tries to take a shower but is interrupted when a squid-like creature emerges from the drain.  The next day, after Nathan tries to harvest his tomatoes - which have all turned out misshapen and inedible - he and Theresa get into a fight when the internet goes out again and she loses a client.\n\nThe next night, Theresa hears Jack and Benny screaming in the barn and rushes to their aid.  To their horror, something awful has happened to the alpacas, and they try to flee the barn only to be struck by several bolts of Color lightning which fuses Theresa and Jack together into a single, deranged mass.  Unable to start the car or call for help as all electronic devices have stopped functioning, Nathan and the other children carry the monster into the attic where they struggle to decide what to do about the miserable, gibbering thing.  Nathan, enraged at what the Color has done to his family, gets a shotgun and enters the barn, where he finds all of his alpacas fused together, and he destroys the resulting creature.  He returns to the attic, orders his children to leave, and prepares to put down his mutated wife and son, but he cannot go through with it.\n\nLavinia tries to perform a Wiccan ceremony to save her family, mutilating herself in the process. She and Benny conspire to run away from the farm, but as they are preparing to leave, Benny hears Sam whining down in the well and insists on going down after him.  The Color bursts from the water and kills him, driving Lavinia insane.  Losing his grip on sanity, Nathan locks Lavinia in the attic with the monster, which has now grown aggressive and attacks her.  Ward and the sheriff arrive and break into the attic, and Nathan kills the creature, saying that he could no longer recognize it as his family.  As they exit the house, the Color erupts out of the well and drives Nathan insane.  He tries to shoot the Color, but the sheriff mistakes Nathan's aim for Ward and shoots Nathan, who dies in Lavinia's arms. Lavinia declares she will not leave, and neither will anyone else, because the Color will not allow it.\n\nStill intent on leaving, Ward and the sheriff go to pick up Ezra, but only find his desiccated corpse and a recording he left behind, where he surmises that the Color is attempting to remake Earth into \"something it knows.\"  The corpse implodes, raining Color down everywhere, while a now sentient tree ensnares Pierce and kills him by ramming a branch down his throat.\n\nWard arrives and attempts to rescue Lavinia, but the Color explodes from the well and roars into the sky in a towering funnel. Lavinia touches him and shares with him her vision of where the Color hails from \u2013 a horrific sector of outer space inhabited by [[Great Old Ones|disturbing, tentacled alien entities similar to itself]] \u2013 and as he is traumatized, she dissolves into dust from her corruption. Attempting to save himself, Ward hides in the farmhouse, where space and time begin to unravel around him as he is confronted by jumbled visions of the Gardner family, and attacked by a murderous apparition of Nathan speaking in all of the family's voices, and narrowly hides in the wine cellar as the Color vanishes into the sky, tearing down the house and leaving the surrounding farmland a \"blasted heath\", covered in ash and drained of all color and life except for Ward himself.\n\nIn an epilogue, a traumatized Ward stands on top of the finished dam, and says that knowing what he knows about this place, he will never drink its water, and affirming his fear that more [[Outer Gods| beings]] like the Color may find their way to Earth as well.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Nicolas Cage]] as Nathan Gardner\n* [[Joely Richardson]] as Theresa Gardner\n* [[Madeleine Arthur]] as Lavinia Gardner\n* [[Brendan Meyer]] as Benny Gardner\n* Julian Hilliard as Jack Gardner\n* [[Elliot Knight]] as Ward Phillips\n* [[Q'orianka Kilcher]] as Mayor Tooma\n* [[Tommy Chong]] as Ezra\n* Josh C.

A [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], he served as mayor of [[Troy, New York]] (1875\u20131883), chairman of the [[New York State Democratic Committee]] (1888\u20131894), and a [[United States Senator]] from [[New York (state)|New York]] (1893\u20131899).\n\nA native of Troy, Murphy was educated in Troy and attended the [[Coll\u00e8ge de Montr\u00e9al]] with the intention of becoming a priest.  Deciding to pursue a business career instead, Murphy attended St. John's College (now [[Fordham University]]), from which he graduated in 1857.  He then joined his father's brewing business, which he managed in partnership with his father.  After his father's retirement, Murphy operated the brewery until merging with another local brewer to form a partnership known as Murphy & Kennedy.  Murphy's other business interests included serving as president of the Troy Gas Company.  Murphy was also a shareholder in the Troy City Railway and the city's electric company.\n\nLong active in politics as a Democrat, Murphy was a delegate to many of the party's local, county, state, and national conventions.  He was active in Troy's city government, and served as an alderman from 1864 to 1866, fire commissioner from 1874 to 1875, and mayor from 1875 to 1883.  From 1888 to 1894 he was chairman of the [[New York State Democratic Committee]].  In 1893, Democrats controlled the New York State Legislature, and were able to elect a Democrat to the U.S. Senate as the successor to [[Frank Hiscock]].  Murphy was selected as the Democratic nominee, and won the legislative election.  Murphy served one term, March 4, 1893 to March 3, 1899.  Republicans controlled the legislature in 1899, and Murphy was succeeded in the Senate by Republican [[Thomas C.

A [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], he served as mayor of [[Troy, New York]] (1875\u20131883), chairman of the [[New York State Democratic Committee]] (1888\u20131894), and a [[United States Senator]] from [[New York (state)|New York]] (1893\u20131899).\n\nA native of Troy, Murphy was educated in Troy and attended the [[Coll\u00e8ge de Montr\u00e9al]] with the intention of becoming a priest.  Deciding to pursue a business career instead, Murphy attended St. John's College (now [[Fordham University]]), from which he graduated in 1857.  He then joined his father's brewing business, which he managed in partnership with his father.  After his father's retirement, Murphy operated the brewery until merging with another local brewer to form a partnership known as Murphy & Kennedy.  Murphy's other business interests included serving as president of the Troy Gas Company.  Murphy was also a shareholder in the Troy City Railway and the city's electric company.\n\nLong active in politics as a Democrat, Murphy was a delegate to many of the party's local, county, state, and national conventions.  He was active in Troy's city government, and served as an alderman from 1864 to 1866, fire commissioner from 1874 to 1875, and mayor from 1875 to 1883.  From 1888 to 1894 he was chairman of the [[New York State Democratic Committee]].  In 1893, Democrats controlled the New York State Legislature, and were able to elect a Democrat to the U.S. Senate as the successor to [[Frank Hiscock]].  Murphy was selected as the Democratic nominee, and won the legislative election.  Murphy served one term, March 4, 1893 to March 3, 1899.  Republicans controlled the legislature in 1899, and Murphy was succeeded in the Senate by Republican [[Thomas C. Platt]].\n\nAfter leaving the Senate, Murphy resumed his former business pursuits in Troy, attended several national Democratic conventions as a delegate, and served as chairman of the [[Rensselaer County, New York|Rensselaer County]] Democratic Committee.
