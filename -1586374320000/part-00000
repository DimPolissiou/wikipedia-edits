This was the nation's eighth appearance at the Summer Olympics. The [[National Olympic Committee of Lithuania]] ({{lang-lt|Lietuvos tautinis olimpinis komitetas}}, ''LTOK'') sent a total of 62 athletes to the Games, 39 men and 23 women, to compete in 14 sports. [[Basketball at the 2012 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's tournament|Men's basketball]] was the only team-based sport in which Lithuania had its representation in these Olympic games.\n\nThe Lithuanian team featured past Olympic medalists, including Laser Radial sailor and world champion [[Gintar\u0117 Scheidt]], who previously won the silver in Beijing. Trap shooter [[Daina Gudzinevi\u010di\u016bt\u0117]], and discus thrower and two-time Olympic champion [[Virgilijus Alekna]], who became Lithuania's flag bearer at the opening ceremony, made their fifth Olympic appearance as the oldest and most experienced team members. Basketball player [[\u0160ar\u016bnas Jasikevi\u010dius]] and heptathlete [[Austra Skujyt\u0117]], on the other hand, were among the Lithuanian athletes to compete in four Olympic games. Other notable athletes featured swimmer and world bronze medalist [[Giedrius Titenis]], and [[NBA]] basketball stars [[Linas Kleiza]] and [[Jonas Valan\u010di\u016bnas]] (both played for the [[Toronto Raptors]]).\n\nLithuania left London with a total of six Olympic medals (two gold, one silver, and three bronze). Four of these medals were awarded for the first time in boxing, canoeing and swimming, including all gold medals won by women. Among the nation's medalists were 15-year-old breaststroke swimmer [[R\u016bta Meilutyt\u0117]], the youngest athlete of the team, who surprisingly won Lithuania's first ever gold medal in her sport,<ref>{{cite news|title=Lithuanian 15-year-old Ruta Meilutyte wins shock gold|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/olympics/18906960|publisher=BBC Sports|date=30 July 2012|accessdate=29 August 2012}}</ref> and [[Laura Asadauskait\u0117]], who became the final Olympic champion in London, after winning the women's modern pentathlon. The men's national basketball team failed to advance into the semi-finals for the first time, after losing out to [[Russia men's national basketball team|Russia]].\n\n==Medalists==\n{{main article|2012 Summer Olympics medal table}}\n{{col-begin}}\n| width=\"78%\" align=\"left\" valign=\"top\" |\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n|-\n!

[[Basketball at the 2012 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's tournament|Men's basketball]] was the only team-based sport in which Lithuania had its representation in these Olympic games.\n\nThe Lithuanian team featured past Olympic medalists, including Laser Radial sailor and world champion [[Gintar\u0117 Scheidt]], who previously won the silver in Beijing. Trap shooter [[Daina Gudzinevi\u010di\u016bt\u0117]], and discus thrower and two-time Olympic champion [[Virgilijus Alekna]], who became Lithuania's flag bearer at the opening ceremony, made their fifth Olympic appearance as the oldest and most experienced team members. Basketball player [[\u0160ar\u016bnas Jasikevi\u010dius]] and heptathlete [[Austra Skujyt\u0117]], on the other hand, were among the Lithuanian athletes to compete in four Olympic games. Other notable athletes featured swimmer and world bronze medalist [[Giedrius Titenis]], and [[NBA]] basketball stars [[Linas Kleiza]] and [[Jonas Valan\u010di\u016bnas]] (both played for the [[Toronto Raptors]]).\n\nLithuania left London with a total of six Olympic medals (two gold, one silver, and three bronze). Four of these medals were awarded for the first time in boxing, canoeing and swimming, including all gold medals won by women. Among the nation's medalists were 15-year-old breaststroke swimmer [[R\u016bta Meilutyt\u0117]], the youngest athlete of the team, who surprisingly won Lithuania's first ever gold medal in her sport,<ref>{{cite news|title=Lithuanian 15-year-old Ruta Meilutyte wins shock gold|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/olympics/18906960|publisher=BBC Sports|date=30 July 2012|accessdate=29 August 2012}}</ref> and [[Laura Asadauskait\u0117]], who became the final Olympic champion in London, after winning the women's modern pentathlon. The men's national basketball team failed to advance into the semi-finals for the first time, after losing out to [[Russia men's national basketball team|Russia]].\n\n==Medalists==\n{{main article|2012 Summer Olympics medal table}}\n{{col-begin}}\n| width=\"78%\" align=\"left\" valign=\"top\" |\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n|-\n!

In accordance with its founder's wishes, MGS has remained a predominantly academic school and belongs to the [[Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference]].\n\nIn the post-war period, MGS was a [[direct-grant grammar school]]. It chose to become an independent school in 1976 after the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour government]] abolished the Direct Grant System.<ref>{{cite hansard | url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1978/mar/22/direct-grant-schools | house=House of Commons | date=22 March 1978 |title=Direct Grant Schools |speaker=Miss Margaret Jackson |position=[[Under-Secretary of State]] | column_start=582W | column_end=586W }}</ref>  Fees for 2016\u20132017 were \u00a311,970 per annum.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.mgs.org/209/fees-and-assistance |title=Fees and Assistance |publisher=The Manchester Grammar School |accessdate=27 January 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Motto, coat of arms and school badges==\n[[File:Sapere avde.jpg|thumb|right|[[Sapere Aude]], the Manchester Grammar School school motto]]\n\nThe school's [[motto]] is ''[[wikt:sapere aude|Sapere Aude]]'' (\"Dare to be Wise\"), which was also the motto of the [[County Borough Council|council]] of the former [[County Borough of Oldham]] (now, with the same coat of arms, the [[Metropolitan Borough of Oldham]]),<ref name=\"Bentley\"/> granted on 7 November 1894. ''Sapere aude'' is a quotation from [[Horace]], famously used by [[Immanuel Kant]] and also the motto of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].<ref name=\"COA\">{{cite web|title=The Coat of Arms|url=https://www.mgsarchives.org/the-coat-of-arms|accessdate=12 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe Senior School badge is an outline of an owl, carrying a banner with the word \"dom\" on it. This is a [[Canting arms|heraldic \"canting\"]] reference to its founder, Hugh Oldham, and the badge should be read as \"owl-dom\". This suggests that he pronounced his name, as the local accent in Oldham still tends to do, as \"Ow[l]dem\". Owls are also to be seen in the shield of the [[Metropolitan Borough of Oldham|Borough of Oldham]].<ref name=\"COA\" />\n\nThere is possibly a second significance to the \"dom\" of which Hugh Oldham, as a bishop, would have been very well aware. D.O.M. was and is a standard abbreviation for ''Deo Optimo Maximo'' meaning \"To God, the Best and the Greatest\", a phrase of dedication often required to be written by schoolboys before the Reformation and in Roman Catholic education since, at the head of a new piece of work, a practice continued into adult life by many as they committed a new undertaking into God's hands. This badge replaced the original one when the school colours changed from red, black and yellow to dark and light blue to reflect its connection with the universities of Oxford and Cambridge.\n\nThe Junior School badge, which depicts the face of an owl, was introduced to blazers and ties in 2008.<ref name=\"COA\" />\n\n==History==\n===Foundation===\n[[Image:HrXhrm6hrs580h9.JPG|upright|right|thumb|A drawing of the Chetham's Gatehouse circa 1600.]]\nThe founder, Hugh Oldham, a Manchester-born man, attended [[Exeter College, Oxford]] and [[Queens' College, Cambridge]], after having been tutored in the house of [[Thomas Stanley, 1st Earl of Derby]]. Historical accounts suggest that he was not a particularly learned man, but was in Royal service, being a favoured prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of [[Lady Margaret Beaufort|Margaret Beaufort, Countess of Richmond and Derby]], mother of [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]], and became recognised for his administrative abilities. He was appointed [[Bishop of Exeter]] in 1505. His great wealth came from his water-powered corn mills on the [[River Irk]] near Manchester, which were subsequently used to fund the school's endowment.\n\nOn 2 July 1515 he signed an endowment trust deed establishing the Manchester Free Grammar School for Lancashire Boys. A site was purchased in September 1516 and construction took place between April 1517 and August 1518. The combined cost was \u00a3218.13s.5d, largely given by Oldham, but with the help of his and the Bexwyke (Beswick) family who had provided an earlier endowment for a school within the parish church. A more elaborate deed in 1525 set the detailed rules for the school until the late 19th century.\n\nThe original deed promoted \"Godliness and good learning\" and established that any boy showing sufficient academic ability, regardless of background, might attend, free of charge. The school was situated between [[Manchester Cathedral]], then a collegiate church, and the church's domestic quarters, subsequently [[Chetham's School of Music]].\n\nLater, Oldham's great friend [[Richard Foxe]], the [[Bishop of Winchester]], wished to found a monastery. Oldham, however, convinced him instead to found [[Corpus Christi College, Oxford|Corpus Christi College]] in Oxford and contributed 6000 marks. Oldham also had a hand in the founding of [[Brasenose College, Oxford]].\n\n===Early history===\nThe original foundation provided a school house in the curtilage of Manchester's Parish Church and two graduates (the 'High Master' and the 'Usher') to teach Latin and later Greek, to any children who presented themselves. The school was intended to prepare pupils for university and eventually the Church or the legal profession. Typically, pupils would have stayed for 8 to 10 years before leaving for university. There was often enough money to fund bursaries or exhibitions for pupils.\n\nIn 1654, the world's first free public library was formed next door to MGS in what had been the church's living quarters. This was facilitated by a bequest from a wealthy businessman (and ex-pupil) [[Humphrey Chetham]], which also served to create a [[Charity school|bluecoat]] orphanage there, schooling 40 poor boys.\n\nBy the 18th century, there are thought to have been between 50 and 100 boys in the grammar school at any one time, three or four of whom each year were awarded exhibitions to [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]]. An extra room had been built onto the school house for boys who needed instruction in English before they started [[Latin]], and another master was employed to teach them.\n\n[[File:Manchester Grammar School class in 1908.jpg|thumb|right|Classroom at the old site]]\nThe 1515 building was replaced on the same site in 1776. This was on two levels, an Upper School for the Latin and Greek pupils, a Lower School for the English pupils. Boarding-houses were added and many of the Upper School pupils were boarders from surrounding counties. When De Quincy came as a boarder in 1800, classes were held at roughly 7.00am to 9.00, 9.30 to 12.00 and 3.00pm to 5.00.<ref>Most of the material in the first part of this section is taken from ''The Manchester Grammar School 1515\u20131965'', edited by J A Graham and B A Phythian (both of whom were members of the school's teaching staff at the time), Manchester University Press, 1965</ref>\n\nBy 1808 consideration was being given to moving from the site, as it was becoming insalubrious, but this proved impossible as the deed could not be changed except by Act of Parliament.\n\n<blockquote>\nGoing from the Old Church to Long Millgate&nbsp;... one is in an almost undisguised working men's quarter, for even the shops and beerhouses hardly take the trouble to exhibit a trifling degree of cleanliness&nbsp;... [The Irk, immediately beside the school,] is a narrow, coal black, foul smelling stream full of debris and refuse.<ref>[[Engels]], quoted in ''MGS 1515\u20131965'' referenced above</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[Image:Chethams manchester exterior.jpg|right|thumb|Manchester Grammar extension built in the 1870s (The old site)]]\nA commercial school, in parallel with the classical school, and more suited to Manchester's business climate, was established in the 1830s. By this time the school was getting richer on the proceeds of the mills which provided its funding and had a growing surplus on account. Its 'feoffees' (or governors) were mostly landed gentry from outside Manchester and they were heavily criticised for running the school to suit the needs of their offspring rather than as originally intended, the poor of Manchester. This led to a long running suit at the Court of Chancery, which eventually promoted the commercial side at the expense of the classical side of the school.\n\nThe area around the school continued to change. During the 1840s, [[Manchester Victoria station|Victoria railway station]] was completed opposite the school and the church became [[Manchester Cathedral]]. Then, in the 1870s, a new building, the Manchester Grammar Extension, was built, designed by [[Alfred Waterhouse]], and including new classrooms, laboratories and a gymnasium, reflecting the wider curriculum that had developed since the 1830s. It was connected to the original by a first-storey bridge. It was said that the bridge's purpose was not for ease of movement between the parts of the school, but rather to dwarf Chetham's gatehouse both in terms of size and grandeur.\n\nThe tenure of [[Michael George Glazebrook]] as High Master, beginning in 1888, saw the introduction of three changes according to pupil [[Ernest Barker]]: a system of [[prefects#Academic|prefects]] to keep order, the singing of [[school song]]s conducted by [[John Farmer (1835-1901)|John Farmer]], and the wearing of school-caps and school-hats.<ref>[[Ernest Barker]] (1953) ''Age and Youth'', page 267, [[Oxford University Press]]</ref>\n\n===Recent history===\nBy the early 20th century the school was increasingly receiving funding from the state. This was negligible in 1901, fees providing three quarters of the income, most of the remainder being from the foundation. But by 1931, state grants contributed nearly 30% of the total, and the number of pupils had increased to 1,100.<ref name=\"Bentley\" />\n\nIn 1930 the school moved out of the [[Manchester city centre|city centre]] to accommodate a growing pupil body and provide a wider range of facilities. The new location chosen was in [[Rusholme]], off Old Hall Lane, where the school still stands today.<ref name=\"Bentley\" />\n\nBoth of the school's earlier buildings lay empty, and while the former was destroyed in the [[Second World War]], the latter, renamed the Long Millgate Building, became a teacher training college in the 1950s. In 1969, [[Chetham's School of Music]] was founded and occupied what had been the orphanage. When the teacher training college closed in 1978, Chetham's took over the premises.<ref name=\"Bentley\" />\n\nAfter the [[Education Act 1944]], MGS became a [[direct grant grammar school]], which meant that the bulk of funding was provided by government. Entry was by merit (based on examination) and parents were means-tested and fees paid primarily by local education authorities on a sliding scale. Fees paid by parents amounted to less than 20% of the total income. It reverted to independent status in 1976 after the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour government]] \u2013 in the person of Education Secretary [[Shirley Williams]] \u2013 abolished the direct-grant funding system. Bursaries continue to support the merit based recruitment system, by abating fees for less well off pupils.<ref>Figures from ''MGS 1515\u20131965'' referenced above</ref>\n\nWhen the [[Assisted Places Scheme]] was rescinded in the late 1990s, MGS was the first school to react with a seminal \"Bursary Appeal\", whose patron is [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]]. The appeal has accumulated a value of over \u00a317.5m and finances bursaries, given to boys whose parents are unable to afford the school fees (currently \u00a39,660 per annum). Scholarships are not awarded.\n\nIn 2015 the school walked 500 miles to celebrate its 500 years anniversary. Boys and teachers were asked to raise money for the \"Bursary Appeal\" and walk a mile each. Over 240 pupils currently receive help from the fund.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Fees and Assistance - The Manchester Grammar School|url = http://www.mgs.org/209/fees-and-assistance|website = www.mgs.org|accessdate = 2015-12-13}}</ref>\n<!-- (by which one quarter of the places were directly funded by central government with the rest attracting fees, some paid by the Local Education Authority, some by private pupils and a few funded by so-called Foundation Scholarships awarded on the basis of performance in the school entrance examinations).-->\n\n== Buildings ==\n=== Main building ===\n[[Image:MGS Main Building in Snow.jpg|right|thumb|MGS main building in 2007]]\nThe main building was designed in 1929 by Francis Jones and [[Percy Worthington]]. In keeping with the style of Oxbridge, it features a quadrangle and a grandiose Memorial Hall. Entrance to the quad is by a tripartite arch under a clock tower cupola. There is also the Paton Library (named after J.L. Paton, a former High Master), MGS Archive Room (formerly the Alan Garner Junior Library, which has since become part of the Paton Library), Common Room, Refectory, Medical Centre, Book Shop, Gymnasium and Swimming Pool. This is in addition to classrooms (subjects taught in this building are Art and Design, Mathematics, Economics, Classical Civilisation, Computing, Greek, History, Latin, Religion and Philosophy) and administrative offices. The MGS Theatre has recently undergone extensive rebuilding, to provide a modern and comfortable auditorium, together with studios for rehearsals and drama teaching. The Drama Centre Campaign is chaired by Sir [[Nicholas Hytner]] (Director of the National Theatre and a former pupil) who brought [[Alan Bennett]] and the actors from ''[[The History Boys]]'' to launch the campaign in 2006.\n\nThe main building also houses the Parker Art Hall which is a three-storey arts studio, situated in the south side of the main building. It is named after former High Master J.G. Parker. It includes a ceramics department with two kilns on the ground floor and also a dark room for photography.\n\nSince opening in 1931 the site at Fallowfield has seen many additions to the accommodation.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n==== Mason building ====\nThis is the school's language department, named after P.G. Mason, a former High Master, during whose tenure the building was erected. On the ground floor there are the Language Labs, two suites of listening stations, mainly used to practise the listening parts of national exams. This building was originally the school's Sixth Form block, and was built in 1966\u201367. The foundation stone was laid by the [[Elizabeth II|Queen]] on the occasion of her visit in 1965. By 1970 the shoddiness of the workmanship and materials used was revealed by the cracks which had already started appearing in the internal walls. It is joined to the main building on the ground floor by the Paton Library.\n\n==== Marks building ====\nNamed after former pupil [[Simon Marks]] son of Michael Marks, founder of the [[Marks & Spencer]] empire. It is just west of the main building, and was erected in 1958. Major extensions were made by addition of the first floor (after a gift of \u00a350,000 from Lord Marks) and the [[Israel Sieff, Baron Sieff|Israel Sieff]] Lecture Theatre (after a gift of \u00a35,000 from Lord Marks' brother-in-law), which were opened on 19 September 1962.<ref>Ulula Autumn 1962</ref> It currently hosts the following departments: Physics, General Science (taken by Year 7 and 8 pupils \u2013 before the subject splits into the usual three divisions), Geography, Computing and Mathematics. There are five physics laboratories, including one for radioactive experimentation, on the ground floor. The main computer room is situated on the first floor of the Marks building.\n\n====Theatres and drama  ====\nSieff Theatre is named after former pupil, [[Israel Sieff]], is situated at the end of the Marks Building and was refurbished in 2006; it is used for lectures and assemblies, as well as being the venue to Muslim Friday prayers. The school has replaced its original Lecture Theatre with a new Drama Centre. This was opened in November 2010.\n\n==== Sports hall and rectory building====\nThe Michael Atherton Sports Hall was opened by [[Mike Atherton]] (a former pupil) in 1997 and subsequently used by the BBC Philharmonic Orchestra in recording of a live CD. The sports hall was severely damaged in a gale in February 2014 and had to be demolished. There are also 2 squash courts adjacent to the sports hall. The former rectory of St James's Birch-in-Rusholme (the adjacent redundant church) it is located near the Sports Hall, and is the home of the Biology Department. However, only A-level biology is taught there. A new sports hall was opened in 2016.<ref name=\"new sports hall\">{{cite web|title=Ex-England cricket captain Mike Atherton returns to Manchester Grammar School to open new sports hall|url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/mike-atherton-cricket-manchester-grammar-10482508|accessdate=12 January 2017}}</ref>\n\n==== Music school ====\nLocated at the rear of the school, it is the building where the music department is based. There is a music library in the basement as well as a dozen or so music practice rooms, each having a piano, used for private lessons. It contains a keyboard suite allowing first and second years to learn basic keyboard playing and a hall on the west side used primarily for orchestra rehearsals. The original part of the building where the practice rooms are now located had been used in the 1950s and '60s as a bicycle shed.<ref>Len Brown, Old Mancunian, 1952\u201358</ref>\n\n=== Junior School buildings ===\n[[File:MGS Bexwyke Lodge.jpg|thumb|Bexwyke Lodge]]\nIn September 2008, MGS opened a Junior School for pupils in Years 5 and 6 and its doors open to Years 3 and 4 in September 2011; boys entering the Junior School do not sit an entrance exam but attend an assessment day and gain automatic admission into Year 7. The Junior School buildings are both state-of-the-art timber buildings, constructed from sustainable materials imported from [[Estonia]].\n\nJunior School pupils in Years 3, 4 and 5 are located in Plessyngton Lodge. Year 6 pupils work in Bexwyke Lodge, and 1 class of year 5 previously worked in Bexyke Lodge.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mgs.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=360&Itemid=320 |title=Bexwyke and Plessyngton Lodges |publisher=The Manchester Grammar School |accessdate=28 April 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://mgs.org/the-mgs-junior-school/the-lodges |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140328180304/http://mgs.org/the-mgs-junior-school/the-lodges |archivedate=28 March 2014 |title=The Lodges |work=The Manchester Grammar School |year=2015 |accessdate=3 February 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Outdoor Study and Pursuits Centres===\nThe school owns the '''Owls' Nest''', a large hut situated in [[Disley]], south of Manchester, near to [[Lyme Park]]. The original ex-Army hut was opened at Christmas 1920, but it was destroyed by a [[Manchester Blitz|German bomb on 23 December 1940]], and a replacement was provided in 1950.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mgs.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=121&Itemid=116 |title=Owls' Nest page |work=The Manchester Grammar School |accessdate=6 October 2010}}</ref> The building is used by forms and activity groups of the school as a base for outdoor trips and camping expeditions. It is most frequently used by classes in Years 7 and 8, who spend a weekend there with their form teacher and form prefects. Wide games such as \"British Bulldog\" take place in the surrounding fields, and [[orienteering]] challenges in nearby Lyme Park. It is also used by school clubs such as the MGS Astronomical Society who use it for observational weekends because it is away from the lights of Manchester. The name refers to the school's logo of the owl.\n\nThere are four annual '''School Camps''', which have been in existence for many decades. They are held at [[Grasmere (village)|Grasmere]], [[River Wye|Wye (Herefordshire)]], [[Bassenthwaite]] and [[Borrowdale]]. In Grasmere, the school has its own campsite donated by Old Mancunians in 1931. Visits to camps take part in the annual Activities Week, which is a week in which an impressive array of co-curricular activities are on offer to pupils.\n\nIn 2009 MGS opened the Old School House, its new outdoor study and pursuits centre in [[Kirkby Stephen]], Cumbria. Set on a hillside with stunning views of the [[Vale of Eden]] and the [[Lake District]] [[fell]]s, the facility offers opportunities such as [[The Duke of Edinburgh's Award|D of E expeditions]], choral and concert practice, art workshops and courses on the Theory of Knowledge. The purchase of the Old School House was partially financed by Old Mancunian, John Young and his wife Elizabeth.\n\n==School organisation==\n===Academic life===\nThe school was among the first in the UK to adopt the International Mathematics GCSE.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} Soon afterwards, MGS also adopted the three Sciences and today it offers the IGCSE in most subjects. The main difference between IGCSE and GCSE is that the [[International General Certificate of Secondary Education|IGCSE]] does not have a compulsory coursework element, primarily because it would be too costly to moderate around the world. The maths and science departments decided that pupils were finding the coursework (which forms a fifth of the marks awarded in the national GCSE) undemanding and tedious and so made the switch in 2005.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/manchester/4745367.stm|title=School drops 'tedious' maths GCSE|work=BBC News|date=4 August 2005}}</ref> In 2009 the GCSE was replaced by the IGCSE in most subjects (see below). At the same time the school began to offer additional GCSEs in Electronics and Mandarin Chinese, as well as Economics at A Level. \n\nSubjects available at GCSE/IGCSE are:<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.mgs.org/175/academic-departments|title=Academic Departments - The Manchester Grammar School|website=www.mgs.org|language=en|access-date=2018-05-21}}</ref>\n\n* Art and Design (GCSE)\n* Biology\n* Chemistry\n* Classical Civilisation (GCSE)\n* Classical Greek (GCSE)\n* Computer Science\n* Drama (GCSE)\n* English Language\n* English Literature\n* Electronics (GCSE)\n* Geography\n* History\n* Latin (GCSE)\n* Mathematics & Further Mathematics (GCSE)\n* Modern Languages (French, Spanish, Italian, German, Russian (GCSE), Mandarin Chinese (GCSE))\n* Music\n* Physics\n* Religious Studies\n\nAll the above subjects are available as Post-16 Qualifications (A-Level, International A-Level or Pre-U) as well as Politics and Economics.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe school is known for its outstanding academic results. In 2017 91% of all A-Level grades were A*-B and at GCSE/IGCSE 68% of all grades were at the A* level.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mgs.org/177/results|title=Results - The Manchester Grammar School|website=www.mgs.org|language=en|access-date=2018-05-21}}</ref>\n\n===Community Action===\nVolunteering or \"Community Action\" at the school is an important part of school life. Pupils visit many primary schools in less fortunate areas during their lunch breaks to help younger children to read. Every Christmas, presents donated by the local community are distributed by MGS pupils in [[City of Salford|Salford]] to families who would otherwise not be able to afford presents for their children. During sixth form options, some pupils hold a coffee morning at a residential care home for the elderly in Salford. Other activities include paired reading at primary schools, distribution of food at Harvest and gifts at Christmas in deprived areas of Salford, visiting the elderly, teaching English as an additional language, recycling schemes, gardening, working with specialist schools or volunteering at the [[Chinatown, Manchester|Manchester Chinese Centre]] and many more. Lots of MGS boys take part in the Millennium Volunteers V scheme (now 'Vinvolved') and receive certificates for logging their volunteering activities. There are plans for many more community action projects, including the launching of a new Community Action website.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mgs.org/188/service|title=Service - The Manchester Grammar School|website=www.mgs.org|language=en|access-date=2018-05-21}}</ref>\n\n===Partnerships with local schools===\nTwo girls' schools are situated nearby: [[Manchester High School for Girls]] and [[Withington Girls' School]]. MGS often collaborates with them particularly in music and drama events.\n\nIn 2013 the school founded in partnership with [[Manchester City Council]] and [[Urban Splash]], [[New Islington]] Free School.\n\n===Partnerships in Africa===\nMGS is also twinned with a school in [[Uganda]]. MGS became linked with the [[Busoga College|Busoga College Mwiri]] in 1990 as a consequence of their support for the Busoga Trust. The school donated second-hand science equipment, textbooks and, in 1998, equipped the Mwiri computer centre with almost one hundred PCs. A succession of MGS pupils have been to Mwiri to teach for a term in their gap year and five members of MGS staff and the School Medical Officer have made a combined total of over 20 visits to Mwiri. Some of MGS's pupils first formers (year 7) visited the college in 2003. In return Chairmen of Governors, Headmasters and Deputy Heads from Mwiri have visited MGS. A programme has been initiated to enable one member of the Mwiri staff each year to visit MGS for three weeks in September. This scheme was the brainchild of former Head of Physics, Roger Hand, who retired in 2008.\n\n==Publications==\nThere are three publications focusing on the school.\n\n'''''Ulula''''' is an annual full-colour magazine detailing life at MGS during the year. It contains a comprehensive review of activities of the societies, results achieved by the sports teams, dramatic and musical performances, as well as a selection of literary and fine art work made by the boys. It also serves to announce new appointments, retirements and departures of staff members. For those pupils who leave in the year prior to the issue of Ulula, the universities to which they are moving is listed.\n\n''''MGS News'''' is an annual 20-page glossy magazine published in October. It illustrates articles on the successes of MGS pupils, along with features on Old Mancunians and school events and activities. It is produced in-house by the Public Relations Department for promulgation to visitors at open events, current and prospective parents and teachers and the wider MGS community.\n\nThe '''''New Mancunian''''', is the school pupil newspaper which is written and produced by pupils and has won several national awards.<ref>[https://archive.is/20070504211734/http://www.mgs.org/view_page.asp?sel_sub_menu_id=526&sel_menu_id=152&section_id=4&page_id=852 MGS.org ]</ref> This is twinned in nomenclature with the '''''Old Mancunian''''' which is a monthly pamphlet sent out to ex-pupils.\n\nSpecialist publications are produced by societies, such as the Philsoc and Docsoc (science and medical societies respectively) magazines.\n\n==Old Mancunians \u2013 notable alumni==\n{{Main|List of Old Mancunians}}\n{{maincat|People educated at Manchester Grammar School}}\nThe school's alumni are called \"Old Mancunians\", or informally ''Old Mancs'', and include academics, politicians, mathematicians, sportsmen, such as former England cricket captain [[Mike Atherton]], former Lancashire Captain, [[Mark Chilton]], and former Lancashire and England batsman, [[John Crawley]], several notable writers, such as [[Thomas de Quincey]], playwright [[Robert Bolt]], author [[Alan Garner]], after whom the school's Junior Library is named, and journalist and broadcaster [[Martin Sixsmith]]. Other Old Mancunians are [[John Charles Polanyi]] (b. 1929) who won the 1986 [[Nobel Prize]] for Chemistry, actors [[Ben Kingsley]] and [[Robert Powell]], historian [[Michael Wood (historian)|Michael Wood]], popular science writer [[Brian Clegg (writer)|Brian Clegg]], concert organist [[Daniel Moult]], comic [[Chris Addison]], and cryptographers [[Clifford Cocks]] and [[Malcolm J.

In accordance with its founder's wishes, MGS has remained a predominantly academic school and belongs to the [[Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference]].\n\nIn the post-war period, MGS was a [[direct-grant grammar school]]. It chose to become an independent school in 1976 after the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour government]] abolished the Direct Grant System.<ref>{{cite hansard | url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1978/mar/22/direct-grant-schools | house=House of Commons | date=22 March 1978 |title=Direct Grant Schools |speaker=Miss Margaret Jackson |position=[[Under-Secretary of State]] | column_start=582W | column_end=586W }}</ref>  Fees for 2016\u20132017 were \u00a311,970 per annum.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.mgs.org/209/fees-and-assistance |title=Fees and Assistance |publisher=The Manchester Grammar School |accessdate=27 January 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Motto, coat of arms and school badges==\n[[File:Sapere avde.jpg|thumb|right|[[Sapere Aude]], the Manchester Grammar School school motto]]\n\nThe school's [[motto]] is ''[[wikt:sapere aude|Sapere Aude]]'' (\"Dare to be Wise\"), which was also the motto of the [[County Borough Council|council]] of the former [[County Borough of Oldham]] (now, with the same coat of arms, the [[Metropolitan Borough of Oldham]]),<ref name=\"Bentley\"/> granted on 7 November 1894. ''Sapere aude'' is a quotation from [[Horace]], famously used by [[Immanuel Kant]] and also the motto of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].<ref name=\"COA\">{{cite web|title=The Coat of Arms|url=https://www.mgsarchives.org/the-coat-of-arms|accessdate=12 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe Senior School badge is an outline of an owl, carrying a banner with the word \"dom\" on it. This is a [[Canting arms|heraldic \"canting\"]] reference to its founder, Hugh Oldham, and the badge should be read as \"owl-dom\". This suggests that he pronounced his name, as the local accent in Oldham still tends to do, as \"Ow[l]dem\". Owls are also to be seen in the shield of the [[Metropolitan Borough of Oldham|Borough of Oldham]].<ref name=\"COA\" />\n\nThere is possibly a second significance to the \"dom\" of which Hugh Oldham, as a bishop, would have been very well aware. D.O.M. was and is a standard abbreviation for ''Deo Optimo Maximo'' meaning \"To God, the Best and the Greatest\", a phrase of dedication often required to be written by schoolboys before the Reformation and in Roman Catholic education since, at the head of a new piece of work, a practice continued into adult life by many as they committed a new undertaking into God's hands. This badge replaced the original one when the school colours changed from red, black and yellow to dark and light blue to reflect its connection with the universities of Oxford and Cambridge.\n\nThe Junior School badge, which depicts the face of an owl, was introduced to blazers and ties in 2008.<ref name=\"COA\" />\n\n==History==\n===Foundation===\n[[Image:HrXhrm6hrs580h9.JPG|upright|right|thumb|A drawing of the Chetham's Gatehouse circa 1600.]]\nThe founder, Hugh Oldham, a Manchester-born man, attended [[Exeter College, Oxford]] and [[Queens' College, Cambridge]], after having been tutored in the house of [[Thomas Stanley, 1st Earl of Derby]]. Historical accounts suggest that he was not a particularly learned man, but was in Royal service, being a favoured prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of [[Lady Margaret Beaufort|Margaret Beaufort, Countess of Richmond and Derby]], mother of [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]], and became recognised for his administrative abilities. He was appointed [[Bishop of Exeter]] in 1505. His great wealth came from his water-powered corn mills on the [[River Irk]] near Manchester, which were subsequently used to fund the school's endowment.\n\nOn 2 July 1515 he signed an endowment trust deed establishing the Manchester Free Grammar School for Lancashire Boys. A site was purchased in September 1516 and construction took place between April 1517 and August 1518. The combined cost was \u00a3218.13s.5d, largely given by Oldham, but with the help of his and the Bexwyke (Beswick) family who had provided an earlier endowment for a school within the parish church. A more elaborate deed in 1525 set the detailed rules for the school until the late 19th century.\n\nThe original deed promoted \"Godliness and good learning\" and established that any boy showing sufficient academic ability, regardless of background, might attend, free of charge. The school was situated between [[Manchester Cathedral]], then a collegiate church, and the church's domestic quarters, subsequently [[Chetham's School of Music]].\n\nLater, Oldham's great friend [[Richard Foxe]], the [[Bishop of Winchester]], wished to found a monastery. Oldham, however, convinced him instead to found [[Corpus Christi College, Oxford|Corpus Christi College]] in Oxford and contributed 6000 marks. Oldham also had a hand in the founding of [[Brasenose College, Oxford]].\n\n===Early history===\nThe original foundation provided a school house in the curtilage of Manchester's Parish Church and two graduates (the 'High Master' and the 'Usher') to teach Latin and later Greek, to any children who presented themselves. The school was intended to prepare pupils for university and eventually the Church or the legal profession. Typically, pupils would have stayed for 8 to 10 years before leaving for university. There was often enough money to fund bursaries or exhibitions for pupils.\n\nIn 1654, the world's first free public library was formed next door to MGS in what had been the church's living quarters. This was facilitated by a bequest from a wealthy businessman (and ex-pupil) [[Humphrey Chetham]], which also served to create a [[Charity school|bluecoat]] orphanage there, schooling 40 poor boys.\n\nBy the 18th century, there are thought to have been between 50 and 100 boys in the grammar school at any one time, three or four of whom each year were awarded exhibitions to [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]]. An extra room had been built onto the school house for boys who needed instruction in English before they started [[Latin]], and another master was employed to teach them.\n\n[[File:Manchester Grammar School class in 1908.jpg|thumb|right|Classroom at the old site]]\nThe 1515 building was replaced on the same site in 1776. This was on two levels, an Upper School for the Latin and Greek pupils, a Lower School for the English pupils. Boarding-houses were added and many of the Upper School pupils were boarders from surrounding counties. When De Quincy came as a boarder in 1800, classes were held at roughly 7.00am to 9.00, 9.30 to 12.00 and 3.00pm to 5.00.<ref>Most of the material in the first part of this section is taken from ''The Manchester Grammar School 1515\u20131965'', edited by J A Graham and B A Phythian (both of whom were members of the school's teaching staff at the time), Manchester University Press, 1965</ref>\n\nBy 1808 consideration was being given to moving from the site, as it was becoming insalubrious, but this proved impossible as the deed could not be changed except by Act of Parliament.\n\n<blockquote>\nGoing from the Old Church to Long Millgate&nbsp;... one is in an almost undisguised working men's quarter, for even the shops and beerhouses hardly take the trouble to exhibit a trifling degree of cleanliness&nbsp;... [The Irk, immediately beside the school,] is a narrow, coal black, foul smelling stream full of debris and refuse.<ref>[[Engels]], quoted in ''MGS 1515\u20131965'' referenced above</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[Image:Chethams manchester exterior.jpg|right|thumb|Manchester Grammar extension built in the 1870s (The old site)]]\nA commercial school, in parallel with the classical school, and more suited to Manchester's business climate, was established in the 1830s. By this time the school was getting richer on the proceeds of the mills which provided its funding and had a growing surplus on account. Its 'feoffees' (or governors) were mostly landed gentry from outside Manchester and they were heavily criticised for running the school to suit the needs of their offspring rather than as originally intended, the poor of Manchester. This led to a long running suit at the Court of Chancery, which eventually promoted the commercial side at the expense of the classical side of the school.\n\nThe area around the school continued to change. During the 1840s, [[Manchester Victoria station|Victoria railway station]] was completed opposite the school and the church became [[Manchester Cathedral]]. Then, in the 1870s, a new building, the Manchester Grammar Extension, was built, designed by [[Alfred Waterhouse]], and including new classrooms, laboratories and a gymnasium, reflecting the wider curriculum that had developed since the 1830s. It was connected to the original by a first-storey bridge. It was said that the bridge's purpose was not for ease of movement between the parts of the school, but rather to dwarf Chetham's gatehouse both in terms of size and grandeur.\n\nThe tenure of [[Michael George Glazebrook]] as High Master, beginning in 1888, saw the introduction of three changes according to pupil [[Ernest Barker]]: a system of [[prefects#Academic|prefects]] to keep order, the singing of [[school song]]s conducted by [[John Farmer (1835-1901)|John Farmer]], and the wearing of school-caps and school-hats.<ref>[[Ernest Barker]] (1953) ''Age and Youth'', page 267, [[Oxford University Press]]</ref>\n\n===Recent history===\nBy the early 20th century the school was increasingly receiving funding from the state. This was negligible in 1901, fees providing three quarters of the income, most of the remainder being from the foundation. But by 1931, state grants contributed nearly 30% of the total, and the number of pupils had increased to 1,100.<ref name=\"Bentley\" />\n\nIn 1930 the school moved out of the [[Manchester city centre|city centre]] to accommodate a growing pupil body and provide a wider range of facilities. The new location chosen was in [[Rusholme]], off Old Hall Lane, where the school still stands today.<ref name=\"Bentley\" />\n\nBoth of the school's earlier buildings lay empty, and while the former was destroyed in the [[Second World War]], the latter, renamed the Long Millgate Building, became a teacher training college in the 1950s. In 1969, [[Chetham's School of Music]] was founded and occupied what had been the orphanage. When the teacher training college closed in 1978, Chetham's took over the premises.<ref name=\"Bentley\" />\n\nAfter the [[Education Act 1944]], MGS became a [[direct grant grammar school]], which meant that the bulk of funding was provided by government. Entry was by merit (based on examination) and parents were means-tested and fees paid primarily by local education authorities on a sliding scale. Fees paid by parents amounted to less than 20% of the total income. It reverted to independent status in 1976 after the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour government]] \u2013 in the person of Education Secretary [[Shirley Williams]] \u2013 abolished the direct-grant funding system. Bursaries continue to support the merit based recruitment system, by abating fees for less well off pupils.<ref>Figures from ''MGS 1515\u20131965'' referenced above</ref>\n\nWhen the [[Assisted Places Scheme]] was rescinded in the late 1990s, MGS was the first school to react with a seminal \"Bursary Appeal\", whose patron is [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]]. The appeal has accumulated a value of over \u00a317.5m and finances bursaries, given to boys whose parents are unable to afford the school fees (currently \u00a39,660 per annum). Scholarships are not awarded.\n\nIn 2015 the school walked 500 miles to celebrate its 500 years anniversary. Boys and teachers were asked to raise money for the \"Bursary Appeal\" and walk a mile each. Over 240 pupils currently receive help from the fund.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Fees and Assistance - The Manchester Grammar School|url = http://www.mgs.org/209/fees-and-assistance|website = www.mgs.org|accessdate = 2015-12-13}}</ref>\n<!-- (by which one quarter of the places were directly funded by central government with the rest attracting fees, some paid by the Local Education Authority, some by private pupils and a few funded by so-called Foundation Scholarships awarded on the basis of performance in the school entrance examinations).-->\n\n== Buildings ==\n=== Main building ===\n[[Image:MGS Main Building in Snow.jpg|right|thumb|MGS main building in 2007]]\nThe main building was designed in 1929 by Francis Jones and [[Percy Worthington]]. In keeping with the style of Oxbridge, it features a quadrangle and a grandiose Memorial Hall. Entrance to the quad is by a tripartite arch under a clock tower cupola. There is also the Paton Library (named after J.L. Paton, a former High Master), MGS Archive Room (formerly the Alan Garner Junior Library, which has since become part of the Paton Library), Common Room, Refectory, Medical Centre, Book Shop, Gymnasium and Swimming Pool. This is in addition to classrooms (subjects taught in this building are Art and Design, Mathematics, Economics, Classical Civilisation, Computing, Greek, History, Latin, Religion and Philosophy) and administrative offices. The MGS Theatre has recently undergone extensive rebuilding, to provide a modern and comfortable auditorium, together with studios for rehearsals and drama teaching. The Drama Centre Campaign is chaired by Sir [[Nicholas Hytner]] (Director of the National Theatre and a former pupil) who brought [[Alan Bennett]] and the actors from ''[[The History Boys]]'' to launch the campaign in 2006.\n\nThe main building also houses the Parker Art Hall which is a three-storey arts studio, situated in the south side of the main building. It is named after former High Master J.G. Parker. It includes a ceramics department with two kilns on the ground floor and also a dark room for photography.\n\nSince opening in 1931 the site at Fallowfield has seen many additions to the accommodation.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n==== Mason building ====\nThis is the school's language department, named after P.G. Mason, a former High Master, during whose tenure the building was erected. On the ground floor there are the Language Labs, two suites of listening stations, mainly used to practise the listening parts of national exams. This building was originally the school's Sixth Form block, and was built in 1966\u201367. The foundation stone was laid by the [[Elizabeth II|Queen]] on the occasion of her visit in 1965. By 1970 the shoddiness of the workmanship and materials used was revealed by the cracks which had already started appearing in the internal walls. It is joined to the main building on the ground floor by the Paton Library.\n\n==== Marks building ====\nNamed after former pupil [[Simon Marks]] son of Michael Marks, founder of the [[Marks & Spencer]] empire. It is just west of the main building, and was erected in 1958. Major extensions were made by addition of the first floor (after a gift of \u00a350,000 from Lord Marks) and the [[Israel Sieff, Baron Sieff|Israel Sieff]] Lecture Theatre (after a gift of \u00a35,000 from Lord Marks' brother-in-law), which were opened on 19 September 1962.<ref>Ulula Autumn 1962</ref> It currently hosts the following departments: Physics, General Science (taken by Year 7 and 8 pupils \u2013 before the subject splits into the usual three divisions), Geography, Computing and Mathematics. There are five physics laboratories, including one for radioactive experimentation, on the ground floor. The main computer room is situated on the first floor of the Marks building.\n\n====Theatres and drama  ====\nSieff Theatre is named after former pupil, [[Israel Sieff]], is situated at the end of the Marks Building and was refurbished in 2006; it is used for lectures and assemblies, as well as being the venue to Muslim Friday prayers. The school has replaced its original Lecture Theatre with a new Drama Centre. This was opened in November 2010.\n\n==== Sports hall and rectory building====\nThe Michael Atherton Sports Hall was opened by [[Mike Atherton]] (a former pupil) in 1997 and subsequently used by the BBC Philharmonic Orchestra in recording of a live CD. The sports hall was severely damaged in a gale in February 2014 and had to be demolished. There are also 2 squash courts adjacent to the sports hall. The former rectory of St James's Birch-in-Rusholme (the adjacent redundant church) it is located near the Sports Hall, and is the home of the Biology Department. However, only A-level biology is taught there. A new sports hall was opened in 2016.<ref name=\"new sports hall\">{{cite web|title=Ex-England cricket captain Mike Atherton returns to Manchester Grammar School to open new sports hall|url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/mike-atherton-cricket-manchester-grammar-10482508|accessdate=12 January 2017}}</ref>\n\n==== Music school ====\nLocated at the rear of the school, it is the building where the music department is based. There is a music library in the basement as well as a dozen or so music practice rooms, each having a piano, used for private lessons. It contains a keyboard suite allowing first and second years to learn basic keyboard playing and a hall on the west side used primarily for orchestra rehearsals. The original part of the building where the practice rooms are now located had been used in the 1950s and '60s as a bicycle shed.<ref>Len Brown, Old Mancunian, 1952\u201358</ref>\n\n=== Junior School buildings ===\n[[File:MGS Bexwyke Lodge.jpg|thumb|Bexwyke Lodge]]\nIn September 2008, MGS opened a Junior School for pupils in Years 5 and 6 and its doors open to Years 3 and 4 in September 2011; boys entering the Junior School do not sit an entrance exam but attend an assessment day and gain automatic admission into Year 7. The Junior School buildings are both state-of-the-art timber buildings, constructed from sustainable materials imported from [[Estonia]].\n\nJunior School pupils in Years 3, 4 and 5 are located in Plessyngton Lodge. Year 6 pupils work in Bexwyke Lodge, and 1 class of year 5 previously worked in Bexyke Lodge.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mgs.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=360&Itemid=320 |title=Bexwyke and Plessyngton Lodges |publisher=The Manchester Grammar School |accessdate=28 April 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://mgs.org/the-mgs-junior-school/the-lodges |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140328180304/http://mgs.org/the-mgs-junior-school/the-lodges |archivedate=28 March 2014 |title=The Lodges |work=The Manchester Grammar School |year=2015 |accessdate=3 February 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Outdoor Study and Pursuits Centres===\nThe school owns the '''Owls' Nest''', a large hut situated in [[Disley]], south of Manchester, near to [[Lyme Park]]. The original ex-Army hut was opened at Christmas 1920, but it was destroyed by a [[Manchester Blitz|German bomb on 23 December 1940]], and a replacement was provided in 1950.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mgs.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=121&Itemid=116 |title=Owls' Nest page |work=The Manchester Grammar School |accessdate=6 October 2010}}</ref> The building is used by forms and activity groups of the school as a base for outdoor trips and camping expeditions. It is most frequently used by classes in Years 7 and 8, who spend a weekend there with their form teacher and form prefects. Wide games such as \"British Bulldog\" take place in the surrounding fields, and [[orienteering]] challenges in nearby Lyme Park. It is also used by school clubs such as the MGS Astronomical Society who use it for observational weekends because it is away from the lights of Manchester. The name refers to the school's logo of the owl.\n\nThere are four annual '''School Camps''', which have been in existence for many decades. They are held at [[Grasmere (village)|Grasmere]], [[River Wye|Wye (Herefordshire)]], [[Bassenthwaite]] and [[Borrowdale]]. In Grasmere, the school has its own campsite donated by Old Mancunians in 1931. Visits to camps take part in the annual Activities Week, which is a week in which an impressive array of co-curricular activities are on offer to pupils.\n\nIn 2009 MGS opened the Old School House, its new outdoor study and pursuits centre in [[Kirkby Stephen]], Cumbria. Set on a hillside with stunning views of the [[Vale of Eden]] and the [[Lake District]] [[fell]]s, the facility offers opportunities such as [[The Duke of Edinburgh's Award|D of E expeditions]], choral and concert practice, art workshops and courses on the Theory of Knowledge. The purchase of the Old School House was partially financed by Old Mancunian, John Young and his wife Elizabeth.\n\n==School organisation==\n===Academic life===\nThe school was among the first in the UK to adopt the International Mathematics GCSE.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} Soon afterwards, MGS also adopted the three Sciences and today it offers the IGCSE in most subjects. The main difference between IGCSE and GCSE is that the [[International General Certificate of Secondary Education|IGCSE]] does not have a compulsory coursework element, primarily because it would be too costly to moderate around the world. The maths and science departments decided that pupils were finding the coursework (which forms a fifth of the marks awarded in the national GCSE) undemanding and tedious and so made the switch in 2005.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/manchester/4745367.stm|title=School drops 'tedious' maths GCSE|work=BBC News|date=4 August 2005}}</ref> In 2009 the GCSE was replaced by the IGCSE in most subjects (see below). At the same time the school began to offer additional GCSEs in Electronics and Mandarin Chinese, as well as Economics at A Level. \n\nSubjects available at GCSE/IGCSE are:<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.mgs.org/175/academic-departments|title=Academic Departments - The Manchester Grammar School|website=www.mgs.org|language=en|access-date=2018-05-21}}</ref>\n\n* Art and Design (GCSE)\n* Biology\n* Chemistry\n* Classical Civilisation (GCSE)\n* Classical Greek (GCSE)\n* Computer Science\n* Drama (GCSE)\n* English Language\n* English Literature\n* Electronics (GCSE)\n* Geography\n* History\n* Latin (GCSE)\n* Mathematics & Further Mathematics (GCSE)\n* Modern Languages (French, Spanish, Italian, German, Russian (GCSE), Mandarin Chinese (GCSE))\n* Music\n* Physics\n* Religious Studies\n\nAll the above subjects are available as Post-16 Qualifications (A-Level, International A-Level or Pre-U) as well as Politics and Economics.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe school is known for its outstanding academic results. In 2017 91% of all A-Level grades were A*-B and at GCSE/IGCSE 68% of all grades were at the A* level.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mgs.org/177/results|title=Results - The Manchester Grammar School|website=www.mgs.org|language=en|access-date=2018-05-21}}</ref>\n\n===Community Action===\nVolunteering or \"Community Action\" at the school is an important part of school life. Pupils visit many primary schools in less fortunate areas during their lunch breaks to help younger children to read. Every Christmas, presents donated by the local community are distributed by MGS pupils in [[City of Salford|Salford]] to families who would otherwise not be able to afford presents for their children. During sixth form options, some pupils hold a coffee morning at a residential care home for the elderly in Salford. Other activities include paired reading at primary schools, distribution of food at Harvest and gifts at Christmas in deprived areas of Salford, visiting the elderly, teaching English as an additional language, recycling schemes, gardening, working with specialist schools or volunteering at the [[Chinatown, Manchester|Manchester Chinese Centre]] and many more. Lots of MGS boys take part in the Millennium Volunteers V scheme (now 'Vinvolved') and receive certificates for logging their volunteering activities. There are plans for many more community action projects, including the launching of a new Community Action website.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mgs.org/188/service|title=Service - The Manchester Grammar School|website=www.mgs.org|language=en|access-date=2018-05-21}}</ref>\n\n===Partnerships with local schools===\nTwo girls' schools are situated nearby: [[Manchester High School for Girls]] and [[Withington Girls' School]]. MGS often collaborates with them particularly in music and drama events.\n\nIn 2013 the school founded in partnership with [[Manchester City Council]] and [[Urban Splash]], [[New Islington]] Free School.\n\n===Partnerships in Africa===\nMGS is also twinned with a school in [[Uganda]]. MGS became linked with the [[Busoga College|Busoga College Mwiri]] in 1990 as a consequence of their support for the Busoga Trust. The school donated second-hand science equipment, textbooks and, in 1998, equipped the Mwiri computer centre with almost one hundred PCs. A succession of MGS pupils have been to Mwiri to teach for a term in their gap year and five members of MGS staff and the School Medical Officer have made a combined total of over 20 visits to Mwiri. Some of MGS's pupils first formers (year 7) visited the college in 2003. In return Chairmen of Governors, Headmasters and Deputy Heads from Mwiri have visited MGS. A programme has been initiated to enable one member of the Mwiri staff each year to visit MGS for three weeks in September. This scheme was the brainchild of former Head of Physics, Roger Hand, who retired in 2008.\n\n==Publications==\nThere are three publications focusing on the school.\n\n'''''Ulula''''' is an annual full-colour magazine detailing life at MGS during the year. It contains a comprehensive review of activities of the societies, results achieved by the sports teams, dramatic and musical performances, as well as a selection of literary and fine art work made by the boys. It also serves to announce new appointments, retirements and departures of staff members. For those pupils who leave in the year prior to the issue of Ulula, the universities to which they are moving is listed.\n\n''''MGS News'''' is an annual 20-page glossy magazine published in October. It illustrates articles on the successes of MGS pupils, along with features on Old Mancunians and school events and activities. It is produced in-house by the Public Relations Department for promulgation to visitors at open events, current and prospective parents and teachers and the wider MGS community.\n\nThe '''''New Mancunian''''', is the school pupil newspaper which is written and produced by pupils and has won several national awards.<ref>[https://archive.is/20070504211734/http://www.mgs.org/view_page.asp?sel_sub_menu_id=526&sel_menu_id=152&section_id=4&page_id=852 MGS.org ]</ref> This is twinned in nomenclature with the '''''Old Mancunian''''' which is a monthly pamphlet sent out to ex-pupils.\n\nSpecialist publications are produced by societies, such as the Philsoc and Docsoc (science and medical societies respectively) magazines.\n\n==Old Mancunians \u2013 notable alumni==\n{{Main|List of Old Mancunians}}\n{{maincat|People educated at Manchester Grammar School}}\nThe school's alumni are called \"Old Mancunians\", or informally ''Old Mancs'', and include academics, politicians, mathematicians, sportsmen, such as former England cricket captain [[Mike Atherton]], former Lancashire Captain, [[Mark Chilton]], and former Lancashire and England batsman, [[John Crawley]], several notable writers, such as [[Thomas de Quincey]], playwright [[Robert Bolt]], author [[Alan Garner]], after whom the school's Junior Library is named, and journalist and broadcaster [[Martin Sixsmith]]. Other Old Mancunians are [[John Charles Polanyi]] (b. 1929) who won the 1986 [[Nobel Prize]] for Chemistry, actors [[Ben Kingsley]] and [[Robert Powell]], historian [[Michael Wood (historian)|Michael Wood]], popular science writer [[Brian Clegg (writer)|Brian Clegg]], concert organist [[Daniel Moult]], comic [[Chris Addison]], and cryptographers [[Clifford Cocks]] and [[Malcolm J. Williamson]].  Theatre director [[Nicholas Hytner]] and the pianist [[John Ogdon]] were Old Mancunians.<ref name=\"Bentley\" /> Mathematician and Fields Medalist [[Sir Michael Atiyah]] was also educated at the school for two years.\n\n==High Masters==\nFor full details of [[High Master (academic)|High Master]]s up to 1990 with biographical sketches see Bentley.<ref name=\"Bentley\"/> The names and dates of High Masters are also listed in the entrance hall of MGS.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mgs.org/index.php/our-heritage/the-high-masters-of-mgs |title=High Masters of MGS |work=Manchester Grammar School |accessdate=2 January 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100523191927/http://www.mgs.org/index.php/our-heritage/the-high-masters-of-mgs |archivedate=May 23, 2010 }}</ref>\n{{col-start}}\n{{col-break}}\n*1515\u2013\n**          William Pleasington\n**          William Hinde\n**          James Plumtree\n*1534\u2013 \n**          Richard Bradshaw\n**          Thomas Wrench\n**          William Jackson\n*1547\u2013 \n**          Edward Pendleton\n**          William Terrill\n**          James Bateson\n**          Richard Raynton\n*1583\u2013 Thomas Cogan\n*1597\u2013 Edward Chetham\n*1606\u2013 Edward Clayton\n{{col-break}}\n*1616\u2013 John Rowlands\n*1630\u2013 Thomas Harrison\n*1637\u2013 Robert Symonds\n*1638\u2013 [[Ralph Brideoake]]\n*1645\u2013 Nehemiah Paynter\n*1652\u2013 John Wickens\n*1676\u2013 Daniel Hill\n*1677\u2013 William Barrow\n*1720\u2013 Thomas Colburn\n*1722\u2013 John Richards\n*1727\u2013 [[Henry Brooke (divine)|Henry Brook]]\n*1749\u2013 William Purnell\n*1764\u2013 Charles Lawson\n*1807\u2013 [[Jeremiah Smith (Manchester Grammar School)|Jeremiah Smith]]\n*1838\u2013 Robinson Elsdale\n*1840\u2013 John William Richards\n{{col-break}}\n*1842\u2013 Nicholas Germon\n*1859\u2013 [[Frederick William Walker]]\n*1877\u2013 Samuel Dill\n*1888\u2013 [[Michael George Glazebrook]]\n*1890\u2013 [[John Edward King]]\n*    - Sir [[Leon Simon (Zionist)|Leon Simon]]\n*1903\u2013 John Lewis Paton\n*1924\u2013 Douglas Gordon Miller\n*1945\u2013 [[Eric James, Baron James of Rusholme|Eric John Francis James]] (later Lord James of Rusholme)\n*1962\u2013 Peter Geoffrey Mason\n*1978\u2013 David Maland\n*1985\u2013 James Geoffrey Parker\n*1994\u2013 [[George Martin Stephen]]\n*2004\u2013 Christopher Ray\n*2013\u2013 Martin Boulton <ref name=\"HMC 2013 Highmaster\">{{cite web|last=Salmons |first=Heidi |title=New High Master coming home to The Manchester Grammar School |url=http://www.hmc.org.uk/new-high-master-coming-home-to-the-manchester-grammar-school/ |work=HMC |publisher=HMC |accessdate=3 September 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102185617/http://www.hmc.org.uk/new-high-master-coming-home-to-the-manchester-grammar-school/ |archivedate=2 November 2013 }}</ref>\n\n{{col-end}}<br />\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category}}\n*{{Official website|http://www.mgs.org}}\n*[http://www.mgscentral.org Official Virtual Learning Environmen]\n\n{{Schools in Manchester}}\n\n[[Category:Boys' schools in Greater Manchester]]\n[[Category:Primary schools in Manchester]]\n[[Category:Independent schools in Manchester]]\n[[Category:International Baccalaureate schools in England]]\n[[Category:People educated at Manchester Grammar School|.]]\n[[Category:Member schools of the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference]]\n[[Category:Educational institutions established in the 1510s]]\n[[Category:1515 establishments in England]]\n[[Category:Alfred Waterhouse buildings]]\n", "name_user": "Barkhart", "label": "safe", "comment": "tense", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_Grammar_School"}

While the ranks are authorized by Congress, each branch of the [[Uniformed services of the United States|uniformed services]] selects, manages, and uses warrant officers in slightly different ways. For appointment to the rank of warrant officer one (W\u20111), normally a warrant is approved by the secretary of the respective service.<ref name=\"warrant officer appointment\">[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/571 10 U.S. Code \u00a7\u202f571.

For the chief warrant officer ranks (CW\u20112 to CW\u20115), these warrant officers are commissioned by the president. Both warrant officers and chief warrant officers take the same oath as regular [[Officer (armed forces)|commissioned officers]] (O\u20111 to O\u201110).\n\nWarrant officers can and do command [[Detachment (military)|detachments]], [[Military formation|unit]]s, vessels, aircraft, and armored vehicles, as well as lead, coach, train, and counsel subordinates. However, the warrant officer's primary task as a leader is to serve as a technical expert, providing valuable skills, guidance, and expertise to commanders and organizations in their particular field.\n{{TOCLeft}}\n{{clear}}\n\n==Rank insignia==\n{| class=\"wikitable center\"\n|+ Modern insignia and grades of U.S. Military Warrant Officers\n!

In 1916, an Army [[Judge Advocate General's Corps|Judge Advocate General]] review determined that field clerks should be members of the military. Legislation in 1916 authorized those positions as military rather than civilian and created the ranks of Army Field Clerk (the former rank of Headquarters Clerk) and Quarter Master Corps Field Clerk (the former rank of Pay Clerk). In July, 1917, all Field Clerks were considered enlisted and were assigned an enlisted uniform. Their branch insignia was two crossed quill pens (worn on a disk pin on the left side of the standing collar and a freework insignia on the visored cap).\n\nIn 19 December 1917, ''Special Regulation 41'' stated that the Army Field Clerk and Quarter Master Corps Field Clerk ranks were authorized the same uniform as an officer. Their rank insignia was now a freework pin of crossed quill pens on either side of the freework \"U.S.\" pins worn on the standing collar of the M1909 tunic. They were not permitted the brown mohair cuff braid band of an Army officer, but were authorized a silver-and-black braid hatcord for wear with the M1911 Campaign Hat and the officer's \"G.I. Eagle\" on the M1902 peaked cap.\n\nOn 9 July 1918, Congress established the rank and grade of warrant officer concurrent with establishing the Army [[Mine Planter Service (U.S. Army)|Mine Planter Service]] (AMPS)<ref>http://www.militarymuseum.org/Mines.html | The California State Military Museum - Forts Under the Sea - Submarine Mine Defense of San Francisco Bay</ref> within the [[United States Army Coast Artillery Corps|Coast Artillery Corps]]. Creation of the Mine Planter Service replaced an informal service crewed by civilians, replacing them with military personnel, of whom the vessel's master, mates, chief engineer, and assistant engineers were Army warrant officers. Warrant officer rank was indicated by rings of brown cord worn on the lower sleeve of the uniform jacket: two for 2nd Mate and 2nd Assistant Engineer, three for 1st Mate and Assistant Engineer, and four for Ship's Master and Chief Engineer.\n\n{{multiple image\n| header   = U.S. Army Warrant Officer rank insignia from 1941 to 1949\n| width    = 45\n| image1   = FlightOfficerWW2.jpg\n| caption1 = Flight Officer\n| image2   = JuniorWarrantWW2.jpg\n| caption2 = Warrant Officer\n| image3   = ChiefWarrantWW2.jpg\n| caption3 = Chief Warrant Officer\n}}\n{{anchor|W1|WOJG}}Since that time, the position of warrant officer in the Army has been refined. On 21 August 1941, under {{USPL|77|230}}, Congress authorized two grades: warrant officer (junior grade) and chief warrant officer. In 1942, temporary appointments in about 40 occupational areas were made.\nThe insignia for warrant officer (junior grade) was a gold bar {{convert|3/8|in|cm}} wide and {{convert|1|in|cm}} long, rounded at the ends with brown enamel on top and a latitudinal center of gold {{sfrac|1|8}} (0.32&nbsp;cm) inch wide.

Insignia was the same as for a warrant officer (junior grade), except the backing was in blue enamel rather than brown. Most flight officers were graduates of various USAAF flight-training programs, including power and glider pilots, and navigator and bombardier ratings. Graduates were appointed to the rating of flight officer, but some of each graduating class were commissioned as [[second lieutenant]]s. Once reaching operational units and after gaining flying experience, flight officers were later offered direct commissions as lieutenants.\n\nFlight sergeants, who were assigned as transport and glider pilots, were appointed as flight officers when the new rank was created. Some of the first eligible flight officers were Americans who had served as sergeant pilots in the [[Royal Air Force]] and who transferred to the USAAF after the U.S. entered the war.\n\nIn November 1942, the War Department defined the rank order as having warrant officers above all enlisted grades and below all commissioned grades. In March 1944, the first six women were appointed to the warrant officer grades as Band Leaders and administrative specialists.\n\nIn 1947, legislation was sought to introduce four grades of warrant officers. Proposed rank titles were: chief warrant officer, senior warrant officer, warrant officer first class, and warrant officer.\n\nIn 1949, {{USPL|81|351}}, the Career Compensation Act, created four pay grades, W-1 through W-4, for all the armed services. The two warrant ranks were unchanged, but warrant officer (junior grade) was pay grade W-1, while chief warrant officer started at W-2 and could advance to W-3 and -4.\n\nIn late 1949, the Warrant Officer Flight Program was created, which trained thousands of warrant officer pilots. The personnel were to be trained by the US Air Force, but controlled by the US Army Transportation Corps. The first helicopter pilot class was 51A (April 1951 to December 1951), which was trained to fly [[Sikorsky H-19 Chickasaw|H-19 Chickasaws]]. The program was temporarily cancelled in 1959 due to military budget cuts, but was reinstated in 1963 to meet the increased demand.\n\n{{multiple image\n| header   = U.S. Army Warrant Officer rank insignia from 1956 to 2004\n| width1   = 45\n| image1   = US Army WO-1 1950-1972.png\n| caption1 = WO1 (1956-1972)\n| width2   = 45\n| image2   = US Army CW-2 1950-1972.png\n| caption2 = CW2 (1956\u20131972)\n| width3   = 45\n| image3   = US Army CW-3 1950-1972.png\n| caption3 = CW3 (1956\u20131972)\n| width4   = 45\n| image4   = US Army CW-4 1950-1972.png\n| caption4 = CW4 (1956-1972)\n| width5   = 41\n| image5   = US-Army-CW5old.svg\n| caption5 = CW5 (1991\u20132004)\n}}\nIn 1954, the Warrant Officer Act, {{USPL|83|379}}, created separate ranks for each pay grade, W-1 through W-4. On 10 September 1956, AR 670-5 authorized the approved insignia for the new ranks that consisted of a metal frame around a brown enamel bar. The insignia for Warrant Officer 1 (Grade W-1) and Chief Warrant Officer 2 (Grade W-2) was a gold metal frame with one or two horizontal metal bands across it. Chief Warrant Officer 3 and Chief Warrant Officer 4 had a silver frame with one or two horizontal bands across it.\n\nDue to the demand for helicopter pilots in Vietnam, the number of warrant officer pilots grew from about 2,960 in 1966 to more than 12,000 by 1970. In 1973, a reduction in force began and chief warrant officer helicopter pilots were offered promotion to the rank of first lieutenant to retain combat veterans.\n\nOn 10 June 1970, the Army adopted a redesigned warrant officer insignia that was easier to identify. It was a silver bar with one to four black enamel squares on it (one per level of rank). \"In July 1972, Army Warrant Officers began wearing the newly designed silver rank insignia, with black squares...\"<ref>[https://warrantofficerhistory.org/Hist_of_Army_WO.htm#1950-1974 \"Army Warrant Officer History 1950\u20131974\"].

Through progressive levels of expertise in assignments, training, and education, the warrant officer administers, manages, maintains, operates, and integrates Army systems and equipment across the full spectrum of Army operations. Warrant officers are innovative integrators of emerging technologies, dynamic teachers, confident warfighters, and developers of specialized teams of soldiers. They support a wide range of Army missions throughout their careers. Warrant officers in the Army are accessed with specific levels of technical ability. They refine their technical expertise and develop their leadership and management skills through tiered progressive assignment and education. The following are specific characteristics and responsibilities of the separate, successive warrant officer grades:\n\na. Warrant officer one (WO1) / chief warrant officer two (CW2): A WO1 is an officer appointed by warrant with the requisite authority pursuant to assignment level and position given by the Secretary of the Army. CW2s and above are commissioned officers with the requisite authority pursuant to assignment level and position as given by the President of the United States. WO1's and CW2's primary focus is becoming proficient and working on those systems linked directly to their AOC/MOS, that is, their area of concentration (officer AOC), or an enlisted rank's military occupational specialty (MOS). Warrant officers are classified by warrant officer military occupational specialty, or WOMOS. As they become experts on the systems they operate and maintain, their focus migrates to integrating their systems with other branch systems.\n\nb. Chief warrant officer three (CW3): The CW3s are advanced level technical and tactical experts who perform the primary duties of technical leader, trainer, operator, manager, maintainer, sustainer, integrator, and advisor. They also perform any other branch-related duties assigned to them. As they become more senior, their focus becomes integrating branch systems into larger Army systems. \n \nc. Chief warrant officer four (CW4): The CW4s are senior-level technical and tactical experts who perform the duties of technical leader, manager, maintainer, sustainer, integrator, and advisor and serve in a wide variety of branch level positions. As they become more senior, they focus on integrating branch and Army systems into joint and national-level systems. \n \nd. Chief warrant officer five (CW5): The CW5s are master-level technical and tactical experts who perform the primary duties of technical leader, manager, integrator, and advisor. They are the senior technical experts in their branches and serve at [[brigade]] and higher levels. They also serve as '''Command Chief Warrant Officers (CCWO)'''<ref name= ccwo>[https://www.army.mil/article/227507/smdc_command_chief_warrant_officer_discusses_role  Jason Cutshaw (September 20, 2019) SMDC command chief warrant officer discusses role]</ref> for large commands at the brigade level and higher.\n\nNote: Chief warrant officer six was approved by the Army Chief of Staff in 1970 with the anticipation of Congress approving two new grades, W-5 and W-6. However, Congress did not authorize W-5 until 1991 and as of January 2017 has not approved W-6. The original W-5 insignia consisted of a single silver bar superimposed with four equally spaced silver squares with each square bordered in black. In 2004, this insignia was changed to a single silver bar surmounted by a single, narrow, vertical, black stripe. The proposed CW6 insignia had two narrow, vertical, parallel, black stripes.<ref>https://warrantofficerhistory.org/Hist_Army_CW5_Insignia.htm. Retrieved 17 January 2017.

Those appointed would be selected from the noncommissioned officer ranks.\n\nOn 26 August 1916, Congress increased the Marine Corps strength, which included adding the rank of warrant officer; 43 Marine Gunners and 41 Quartermaster Clerks would be appointed. The first Marine Gunner is believed to have been [[Henry L. Hulbert]].<ref>Bevilacqua, Allan C. Major USMC (Ret) ''Henry Lewis Hurlbert-Marine Gunner'' ''Leatherneck'' Dec 2008 Vol XCI No 12</ref> On 22 May 1917, due to commissioned officer shortages, all but three of the appointees were commissioned as temporary second lieutenants. In 1918, the grade of pay clerk was added.\n\nIn June, 1926, Congress created the commissioned warrant grades of Chief Marine Gunner, Chief Quartermaster Clerk, and Chief Pay Clerk. Requirements for promotion to chief warrant officer were six years of service as a warrant officer and an examination to qualify.\n\nDuring World War II, Congress abolished the titles of Marine Gunner, Chief Marine Gunner, Quartermaster Clerk, Chief Quartermaster Clerk, Pay Clerk, and Chief Pay Clerk. Instead, they would be designated warrant officer or commissioned warrant officer. In 1943, all Marine warrant officer ranks were aligned with the other services. They were warrant officer and commissioned warrant officer.\n\nThen in 1949, the grade of WO (paygrade W-1) was created for warrant officers and CWO-2, CWO-3, and CWO-4 (paygrades W-2, W-3, and W-4) were created for commissioned warrant officers. In 1954, title \"Chief Warrant Officer\" replaced \"commissioned warrant officer\" for those in grades CWO-2, CWO-3 and CWO-4.\n\nOn 1 February 1992, the grade of CWO-5 (paygrade W-5) was created and those who are appointed serve on the highest unit echelon levels. Only 5% of chief warrant officers occupy this grade.\n\n===Today===\nThe role and purpose of the Chief Warrant Officer in the United States Marine Corps fulfills the responsibilities as a high-rank 'Subject Matter Expert' within their chosen craft (military occupation specialty [MOS]), and the additional authority of a Commissioned Officer.\n\nThe Chief Warrant Officers commonly provide their respective Marine units and sections, valuable practical experience, and a master level of technical proficiency. Normally, a Unrestricted officer (2ndLt-General) would not have the opportunity to achieve such specialized skills due to their career progression track being more Commander-Centric and less MOS technical as they advance through the ranks.\n\nOnly active-duty enlisted (non-commissioned officers) are accepted into the program. Currently, there are two selection program distinctions, with each its own separate qualifications: administration-oriented or field-oriented.\n\nThe administrative Warrant Officer Selection Program requires a minimum of eight years of active-duty enlistment (not commissioned), proof and/or demonstration of their exceedingly technical proficiency within their MOS field, and achieved the rank and pay grade of Sergeant (E-5) or above.\n\n{{Multiple image\n|header    = U.S. Marine Corps Infantry Weapons Officer 'Gunner' insignia\n|width     = 110\n|image1    = USMC CWO Gunner (Dress).png\n|image2    = USMC CWO Gunner (Black).png\n}}\n{{See also|Infantry Weapons Officer}}\n\nHowever, the duties of an [[Infantry Weapons Officer]] is much more demanding. The Infantry Weapons Officer Program requires a minimum of sixteen years in MOS 0300 (Infantry) and achieved at least the rank and grade of [[Gunnery Sergeant]] (E-7).\n\nWhen either Marine (administrative or field [infantry]) is selected for the program, they are given additional leadership and management training during the Warrant Officer Basic Course (WOBC), conducted at [[The Basic School]], in [[Quantico, Virginia]].<ref name=\"marines\">[http://www.quantico.usmc.mil/Sentry/StoryView.aspx?SID=677 General Emphasizes Leadership at Warrant Officer Commissioning] 2nd Lt.

Upon being commissioned as CWO2, selectees underwent warrant officer indoctrination and then flight school for 18 to 30 months. After completion of flight school, selectees were placed in one of four types of squadrons: Shipbased Helicopter Maritime Strike (HSM) or Helicopter Sea Combat (HSC) squadrons, and land-based fixed-wing maritime patrol and reconnaissance (VP) and fleet air reconnaissance (VQ).

The USAF inherited warrant officer ranks from the Army at its inception in 1947, but their place in the Air Force structure was never made clear. When Congress authorized the creation of two new senior enlisted ranks in each of the five services in 1958 (implementing them in 1959-60), Air Force officials privately concluded that these two new \"super grades\" of [[senior master sergeant]] and [[chief master sergeant]] (styling the incumbents as \"[[Air Force Specialty Code#Enlisted AFSCs|superintendents]]\" vice senior or staff NCOICs as does the USA{{not a typo}} and USMC) could fill all Air Force needs then performed at the warrant officer level. This was not publicly acknowledged until years later. The Air Force stopped appointing warrant officers in 1959.<ref name=\"WO-5\" />\n\nThe last active-duty air force chief warrant officer, CWO4 James H. Long, retired in 1980. The last [[Air Force Reserve Command|Air Force Reserve]] chief warrant officer, CWO4 Bob Barrow, retired in 1992. Upon his retirement, Barrow was honorarily promoted to CWO5, the only person in the Air Force ever to hold this grade.<ref name=\"WO-5\" />\n\n==Coast Guard==\n[[File:US Coast Guard Warrant Officer Specialty Markings-Collar.png|thumb|425px|U.S. Coast Guard Chief Warrant Officer specialty insignia (collar devices)]] Due to the small and decentralized nature of the service, Coast Guard Warrant Officers often fill command roles. Warrant Officers may serve as officers-in-charge of [[Coast Guard Stations]], or even as Command warrant officers. Chief Warrant officers fill a variety of [[billet#United States usage|billets]] as they can command larger small boat stations and patrol boats, as specialists and supervisors in other technical areas, and as special agents in the [[Coast Guard Investigative Service]]. They wear insignia essentially like that of their Navy counterparts, but with the USCG shield between the rank insignia and the specialty mark, as Coast Guard commissioned officers do with their rank insignia. Like their Navy counterparts, candidates for the rank of chief warrant officer must typically be serving in the chief petty officer grades (E-7 through E-9), however, the Coast Guard also permits selection of first class petty officers (E-6) who are chief petty officer selectees and who are in the top 50% on their advancement list to E-7.  The Coast Guard does not use the rank of warrant officer (WO-1). Although authorized in 1994, the Coast Guard does not currently use or have any active CWO5 grade.<ref>United States Coast Guard.

While the ranks are authorized by Congress, each branch of the [[Uniformed services of the United States|uniformed services]] selects, manages, and uses warrant officers in slightly different ways. For appointment to the rank of warrant officer one (W\u20111), normally a warrant is approved by the secretary of the respective service.<ref name=\"warrant officer appointment\">[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/571 10 U.S. Code \u00a7\u202f571.

Both warrant officers and chief warrant officers take the same oath as regular [[Officer (armed forces)|commissioned officers]] (O\u20111 to O\u201110).\n\nWarrant officers can and do command [[Detachment (military)|detachments]], [[Military formation|unit]]s, vessels, aircraft, and armored vehicles, as well as lead, coach, train, and counsel subordinates. However, the warrant officer's primary task as a leader is to serve as a technical expert, providing valuable skills, guidance, and expertise to commanders and organizations in their particular field.\n{{TOCLeft}}\n{{clear}}\n\n==Rank insignia==\n{| class=\"wikitable center\"\n|+ Modern insignia and grades of U.S. Military Warrant Officers\n!

In 1916, an Army [[Judge Advocate General's Corps|Judge Advocate General]] review determined that field clerks should be members of the military. Legislation in 1916 authorized those positions as military rather than civilian and created the ranks of Army Field Clerk (the former rank of Headquarters Clerk) and Quarter Master Corps Field Clerk (the former rank of Pay Clerk). In July, 1917, all Field Clerks were considered enlisted and were assigned an enlisted uniform. Their branch insignia was two crossed quill pens (worn on a disk pin on the left side of the standing collar and a freework insignia on the visored cap).\n\nIn 19 December 1917, ''Special Regulation 41'' stated that the Army Field Clerk and Quarter Master Corps Field Clerk ranks were authorized the same uniform as an officer. Their rank insignia was now a freework pin of crossed quill pens on either side of the freework \"U.S.\" pins worn on the standing collar of the M1909 tunic. They were not permitted the brown mohair cuff braid band of an Army officer, but were authorized a silver-and-black braid hatcord for wear with the M1911 Campaign Hat and the officer's \"G.I. Eagle\" on the M1902 peaked cap.\n\nOn 9 July 1918, Congress established the rank and grade of warrant officer concurrent with establishing the Army [[Mine Planter Service (U.S. Army)|Mine Planter Service]] (AMPS)<ref>http://www.militarymuseum.org/Mines.html | The California State Military Museum - Forts Under the Sea - Submarine Mine Defense of San Francisco Bay</ref> within the [[United States Army Coast Artillery Corps|Coast Artillery Corps]]. Creation of the Mine Planter Service replaced an informal service crewed by civilians, replacing them with military personnel, of whom the vessel's master, mates, chief engineer, and assistant engineers were Army warrant officers. Warrant officer rank was indicated by rings of brown cord worn on the lower sleeve of the uniform jacket: two for 2nd Mate and 2nd Assistant Engineer, three for 1st Mate and Assistant Engineer, and four for Ship's Master and Chief Engineer.\n\n{{multiple image\n| header   = U.S. Army Warrant Officer rank insignia from 1941 to 1949\n| width    = 45\n| image1   = FlightOfficerWW2.jpg\n| caption1 = Flight Officer\n| image2   = JuniorWarrantWW2.jpg\n| caption2 = Warrant Officer\n| image3   = ChiefWarrantWW2.jpg\n| caption3 = Chief Warrant Officer\n}}\n{{anchor|W1|WOJG}}Since that time, the position of warrant officer in the Army has been refined. On 21 August 1941, under {{USPL|77|230}}, Congress authorized two grades: warrant officer (junior grade) and chief warrant officer. In 1942, temporary appointments in about 40 occupational areas were made.\nThe insignia for warrant officer (junior grade) was a gold bar {{convert|3/8|in|cm}} wide and {{convert|1|in|cm}} long, rounded at the ends with brown enamel on top and a latitudinal center of gold {{sfrac|1|8}} (0.32&nbsp;cm) inch wide. The insignia for chief warrant officer was a gold bar {{convert|3/8|in|cm}} in width and {{convert|1|in|cm}} in length with rounded ends, brown enamel on top with a longitudinal center stripe of gold {{convert|1/8|in|cm}} wide. The brown enamel backing of the warrant officer insignia was based on the color of the sleeve insignia of rank for ship's officers of the AMPS.<ref name=\"WO-1\">{{cite web|url=http://usacac.army.mil/cac2/wocc/woprogram.asp#history|title=Warrant Officer History|publisher=U.S. Army Warrant Officer Career College|accessdate=14 November 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"tioh_rank\">http://www.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil/UniformedServices/Insignia_Rank/warrant_officers.aspx |Insignia of Grade Warrant - Officers</ref><ref>[http://www.usawoa.org/stivers2announced.htm Ship's officers]</ref>\n\nOn 18 July 1942 {{USPL|77|658}}, the Flight Officer Act, was enacted, creating the rank of [[flight officer]], equivalent to warrant officer (junior grade) and assigned to the [[United States Army Air Forces|U.S. Army Air Forces]] (USAAF). Insignia was the same as for a warrant officer (junior grade), except the backing was in blue enamel rather than brown. Most flight officers were graduates of various USAAF flight-training programs, including power and glider pilots, and navigator and bombardier ratings. Graduates were appointed to the rating of flight officer, but some of each graduating class were commissioned as [[second lieutenant]]s. Once reaching operational units and after gaining flying experience, flight officers were later offered direct commissions as lieutenants.\n\nFlight sergeants, who were assigned as transport and glider pilots, were appointed as flight officers when the new rank was created. Some of the first eligible flight officers were Americans who had served as sergeant pilots in the [[Royal Air Force]] and who transferred to the USAAF after the U.S. entered the war.\n\nIn November 1942, the War Department defined the rank order as having warrant officers above all enlisted grades and below all commissioned grades. In March 1944, the first six women were appointed to the warrant officer grades as Band Leaders and administrative specialists.\n\nIn 1947, legislation was sought to introduce four grades of warrant officers. Proposed rank titles were: chief warrant officer, senior warrant officer, warrant officer first class, and warrant officer.\n\nIn 1949, {{USPL|81|351}}, the Career Compensation Act, created four pay grades, W-1 through W-4, for all the armed services. The two warrant ranks were unchanged, but warrant officer (junior grade) was pay grade W-1, while chief warrant officer started at W-2 and could advance to W-3 and -4.\n\nIn late 1949, the Warrant Officer Flight Program was created, which trained thousands of warrant officer pilots. The personnel were to be trained by the US Air Force, but controlled by the US Army Transportation Corps. The first helicopter pilot class was 51A (April 1951 to December 1951), which was trained to fly [[Sikorsky H-19 Chickasaw|H-19 Chickasaws]]. The program was temporarily cancelled in 1959 due to military budget cuts, but was reinstated in 1963 to meet the increased demand.\n\n{{multiple image\n| header   = U.S. Army Warrant Officer rank insignia from 1956 to 2004\n| width1   = 45\n| image1   = US Army WO-1 1950-1972.png\n| caption1 = WO1 (1956-1972)\n| width2   = 45\n| image2   = US Army CW-2 1950-1972.png\n| caption2 = CW2 (1956\u20131972)\n| width3   = 45\n| image3   = US Army CW-3 1950-1972.png\n| caption3 = CW3 (1956\u20131972)\n| width4   = 45\n| image4   = US Army CW-4 1950-1972.png\n| caption4 = CW4 (1956-1972)\n| width5   = 41\n| image5   = US-Army-CW5old.svg\n| caption5 = CW5 (1991\u20132004)\n}}\nIn 1954, the Warrant Officer Act, {{USPL|83|379}}, created separate ranks for each pay grade, W-1 through W-4. On 10 September 1956, AR 670-5 authorized the approved insignia for the new ranks that consisted of a metal frame around a brown enamel bar. The insignia for Warrant Officer 1 (Grade W-1) and Chief Warrant Officer 2 (Grade W-2) was a gold metal frame with one or two horizontal metal bands across it. Chief Warrant Officer 3 and Chief Warrant Officer 4 had a silver frame with one or two horizontal bands across it.\n\nDue to the demand for helicopter pilots in Vietnam, the number of warrant officer pilots grew from about 2,960 in 1966 to more than 12,000 by 1970.

Through progressive levels of expertise in assignments, training, and education, the warrant officer administers, manages, maintains, operates, and integrates Army systems and equipment across the full spectrum of Army operations. Warrant officers are innovative integrators of emerging technologies, dynamic teachers, confident warfighters, and developers of specialized teams of soldiers. They support a wide range of Army missions throughout their careers. Warrant officers in the Army are accessed with specific levels of technical ability. They refine their technical expertise and develop their leadership and management skills through tiered progressive assignment and education. The following are specific characteristics and responsibilities of the separate, successive warrant officer grades:\n\na. Warrant officer one (WO1) / chief warrant officer two (CW2): A WO1 is an officer appointed by warrant with the requisite authority pursuant to assignment level and position given by the Secretary of the Army. CW2s and above are commissioned officers with the requisite authority pursuant to assignment level and position as given by the President of the United States. WO1's and CW2's primary focus is becoming proficient and working on those systems linked directly to their AOC/MOS, that is, their area of concentration (officer AOC), or an enlisted rank's military occupational specialty (MOS). Warrant officers are classified by warrant officer military occupational specialty, or WOMOS. As they become experts on the systems they operate and maintain, their focus migrates to integrating their systems with other branch systems.\n\nb. Chief warrant officer three (CW3): The CW3s are advanced level technical and tactical experts who perform the primary duties of technical leader, trainer, operator, manager, maintainer, sustainer, integrator, and advisor. They also perform any other branch-related duties assigned to them. As they become more senior, their focus becomes integrating branch systems into larger Army systems. \n \nc. Chief warrant officer four (CW4): The CW4s are senior-level technical and tactical experts who perform the duties of technical leader, manager, maintainer, sustainer, integrator, and advisor and serve in a wide variety of branch level positions. As they become more senior, they focus on integrating branch and Army systems into joint and national-level systems. \n \nd. Chief warrant officer five (CW5): The CW5s are master-level technical and tactical experts who perform the primary duties of technical leader, manager, integrator, and advisor. They are the senior technical experts in their branches and serve at [[brigade]] and higher levels. They also serve as '''Command Chief Warrant Officers (CCWO)'''<ref name= ccwo>[https://www.army.mil/article/227507/smdc_command_chief_warrant_officer_discusses_role  Jason Cutshaw (September 20, 2019) SMDC command chief warrant officer discusses role]</ref> for large commands at the brigade level and higher.\n\nNote: Chief warrant officer six was approved by the Army Chief of Staff in 1970 with the anticipation of Congress approving two new grades, W-5 and W-6. However, Congress did not authorize W-5 until 1991 and as of January 2017 has not approved W-6. The original W-5 insignia consisted of a single silver bar superimposed with four equally spaced silver squares with each square bordered in black. In 2004, this insignia was changed to a single silver bar surmounted by a single, narrow, vertical, black stripe. The proposed CW6 insignia had two narrow, vertical, parallel, black stripes.<ref>https://warrantofficerhistory.org/Hist_Army_CW5_Insignia.htm. Retrieved 17 January 2017.

Those appointed would be selected from the noncommissioned officer ranks.\n\nOn 26 August 1916, Congress increased the Marine Corps strength, which included adding the rank of warrant officer; 43 Marine Gunners and 41 Quartermaster Clerks would be appointed. The first Marine Gunner is believed to have been [[Henry L. Hulbert]].<ref>Bevilacqua, Allan C. Major USMC (Ret) ''Henry Lewis Hurlbert-Marine Gunner'' ''Leatherneck'' Dec 2008 Vol XCI No 12</ref> On 22 May 1917, due to commissioned officer shortages, all but three of the appointees were commissioned as temporary second lieutenants. In 1918, the grade of pay clerk was added.\n\nIn June, 1926, Congress created the commissioned warrant grades of Chief Marine Gunner, Chief Quartermaster Clerk, and Chief Pay Clerk. Requirements for promotion to chief warrant officer were six years of service as a warrant officer and an examination to qualify.\n\nDuring World War II, Congress abolished the titles of Marine Gunner, Chief Marine Gunner, Quartermaster Clerk, Chief Quartermaster Clerk, Pay Clerk, and Chief Pay Clerk. Instead, they would be designated warrant officer or commissioned warrant officer. In 1943, all Marine warrant officer ranks were aligned with the other services. They were warrant officer and commissioned warrant officer.\n\nThen in 1949, the grade of WO (paygrade W-1) was created for warrant officers and CWO-2, CWO-3, and CWO-4 (paygrades W-2, W-3, and W-4) were created for commissioned warrant officers. In 1954, title \"Chief Warrant Officer\" replaced \"commissioned warrant officer\" for those in grades CWO-2, CWO-3 and CWO-4.\n\nOn 1 February 1992, the grade of CWO-5 (paygrade W-5) was created and those who are appointed serve on the highest unit echelon levels. Only 5% of chief warrant officers occupy this grade.\n\n===Today===\nThe role and purpose of the Chief Warrant Officer in the United States Marine Corps fulfills the responsibilities as a high-rank 'Subject Matter Expert' within their chosen craft (military occupation specialty [MOS]), and the additional authority of a Commissioned Officer.\n\nThe Chief Warrant Officers commonly provide their respective Marine units and sections, valuable practical experience, and a master level of technical proficiency. Normally, a Unrestricted officer (2ndLt-General) would not have the opportunity to achieve such specialized skills due to their career progression track being more Commander-Centric and less MOS technical as they advance through the ranks.\n\nOnly active-duty enlisted (non-commissioned officers) are accepted into the program. Currently, there are two selection program distinctions, with each its own separate qualifications: administration-oriented or field-oriented.\n\nThe administrative Warrant Officer Selection Program requires a minimum of eight years of active-duty enlistment (not commissioned), proof and/or demonstration of their exceedingly technical proficiency within their MOS field, and achieved the rank and pay grade of Sergeant (E-5) or above.\n\n{{Multiple image\n|header    = U.S. Marine Corps Infantry Weapons Officer 'Gunner' insignia\n|width     = 110\n|image1    = USMC CWO Gunner (Dress).png\n|image2    = USMC CWO Gunner (Black).png\n}}\n{{See also|Infantry Weapons Officer}}\n\nHowever, the duties of an [[Infantry Weapons Officer]] is much more demanding. The Infantry Weapons Officer Program requires a minimum of sixteen years in MOS 0300 (Infantry) and achieved at least the rank and grade of [[Gunnery Sergeant]] (E-7).\n\nWhen either Marine (administrative or field [infantry]) is selected for the program, they are given additional leadership and management training during the Warrant Officer Basic Course (WOBC), conducted at [[The Basic School]], in [[Quantico, Virginia]].<ref name=\"marines\">[http://www.quantico.usmc.mil/Sentry/StoryView.aspx?SID=677 General Emphasizes Leadership at Warrant Officer Commissioning] 2nd Lt.

Upon being commissioned as CWO2, selectees underwent warrant officer indoctrination and then flight school for 18 to 30 months. After completion of flight school, selectees were placed in one of four types of squadrons: Shipbased Helicopter Maritime Strike (HSM) or Helicopter Sea Combat (HSC) squadrons, and land-based fixed-wing maritime patrol and reconnaissance (VP) and fleet air reconnaissance (VQ). These pilots and NFOs were then trained to operate the [[Lockheed P-3 Orion|P-3 Orion]], the [[Lockheed EP-3|EP-3E Aries II]], the [[Boeing E-6 Mercury|E-6 Mercury]], or variants of the [[Sikorsky SH-60 Seahawk|MH-60 Seahawk]].

A [[The Worst Witch (1998 TV series)|TV series based on the books]] aired from 1998 to 2001, and has inspired two spin-offs, ''[[Weirdsister College]]'', aired in 2001, and ''[[The New Worst Witch]]'', aired in 2005. In January 2017, a [[The Worst Witch (2017 TV series)|new series]] premiered in some markets as a [[CBBC]], [[ZDF]], and [[Netflix]] co-production and as of July 2017 it was released internationally on Netflix as a [[List of original programs distributed by Netflix|Netflix Original]].<ref name=\"new_series_2017_prod\" />\n\n==Series overview==\nThe books focus on [[Mildred Hubble]], a young witch who attends Miss Cackle's Academy for Witches, a [[Magic (paranormal)|school of magic]]. Although well-intentioned, Mildred's clumsy personality leads the girl to disastrous situations, and she is thus considered the worst student in the school. The benevolent headmistress, Miss Cackle, is generally  understanding, whereas Mildred's form teacher [[List of The Worst Witch characters#Miss Hardbroom|Miss Hardbroom]] thinks she just isn't trying hard enough. Mildred's friends include [[List of The Worst Witch characters#Maud Spellbody|Maud Spellbody]], a rotund, sensible girl who is always trying to avoid confusion, and [[Enid Nightshade]], a practical joker who is more likely than Mildred to get them all into trouble. The three girls have a strong rivalry with [[List of The Worst Witch characters#Ethel Hallow|Ethel Hallow]], a high-born, snobbish and vindictive classmate.\n\nEach book covers one term at the school. There are two terms each year: the Winter term, from September to January, and the Summer term, from March to July. In ''First Prize for the Worst Witch'', the most recent book, Mildred is in the Summer term of her fourth year.\n \nThe author Jill Murphy began writing ''The Worst Witch'' at the age of 15, while still at school, and based many points of the stories on her own school experiences at [[Ursuline High School, Wimbledon|Ursuline Convent]] in [[Wimbledon, England|Wimbledon]], England, with Singing becoming Chanting, Chemistry becoming Potions and so on.<ref>{{cite news| last = Deeley | first =L.| title =Back on top after a bad spell | work= The Times| date =27 October 2007 | url = http://women.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/women/body_and_soul/article2745146.ece | accessdate =17 April 2008 }}</ref> Recalling how she got the idea for the story, she said: \"My two friends and I used to come home in our dark uniforms, looking very scruffy at the end of the day \u2013 my dark plaits sprouting tufts, with lost hair ribbons. My Mum used to say 'Look at you all. You look like the three witches!' and it gave me the idea for a witch's school \u2013 so that it was exactly like my school, but with a subtle touch of magic. All the characters are based on my school friends (and enemies) and teachers.\"<ref name=\"TelegraphInterview2014\">Alice Vincent, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/booknews/11198259/An-oral-history-of-The-Worst-Witch.html \"An oral history of The Worst Witch....The Worst Witch was only published because of a party\"], ''The Telegraph'', 31 October 2014.</ref> Murphy concluded the first book at the age of 18, but failed to achieve a publishing deal, causing her to \"put it in a drawer\" and decide to \"concentrate on other things instead.\" After working as a nanny and in a children's home, Murphy had a phone call from a small publisher interested in the book. ''The Worst Witch'' was finally published in 1974, when Murphy was 24.\n\n==Books==\n\n===''The Worst Witch''===\n''The Worst Witch'' was first published in 1974 by Allison & Busby, who took the book on after it had been turned down by three other publishers.<ref>Joanna Carey, [http://booksforkeeps.co.uk/issue/136/childrens-books/articles/authorgraph/authorgraph-no136-jill-murphy \"Authorgraph No.136: Jill Murphy\" (interview)], Books For Keeps.</ref><ref name=\"TelegraphInterview2014\"/>\n\n;Plot\nThe novel begins with Mildred Hubble and the upcoming traditional assembly where all of the first-years are given their own black cats that they will teach to ride on their [[broomsticks]] with them. Unlike the other girls, who receive black kittens, Mildred receives a tabby cat, which she simply calls Tabby. The kitten is unable to sit on a broomstick, so Mildred carries Tabby in her bag. Miss Hardbroom disapproves and Mildred has to stop. Afterwards, another witch called Ethel Hallow teases Mildred about it, and dares her to turn her into a frog. Mildred loses her temper and turns Ethel into a pig instead.\n\nIn the next chapter, Mildred and Maud inadvertently make an invisibility potion instead of a laughing potion in their class test.\n\nIn the following chapter, the girls are practising for a broomstick display for [[Halloween]]. Ethel lends Mildred her spare broom, on which she has secretly put a spell. During the Halloween festival, Mildred's broom starts bucking, causing all the girls to fall from their broomsticks. The Chief Magician denounces the academy, and Mildred is summoned to a meeting with Miss Cackle and Miss Hardbroom the next morning. Mildred, fearing expulsion, decides to run away with Tabby.\n\nWhen walking through the forests near the academy, Mildred hears voices through the trees and comes across a group of witches, headed by one who looks like Miss Cackle. After hearing their plot to turn every teacher and student witch in the academy into frogs, Mildred turns the group into snails, packs them into cardboard boxes and takes them back to the academy. At first, Miss Cackle and Miss Hardbroom refuse to believe her, but when Mildred describes the leader, Miss Cackle realises she sounds like her identical twin sister, [[List of minor The Worst Witch characters#Agatha Cackle|Agatha]]. They turn Agatha and the rest of the group back into humans, Mildred's interview is cancelled, and she is praised as a hero to the rest of the academy.\n\n===''The Worst Witch Strikes Again''===\n''The Worst Witch Strikes Again'' was first published in 1980 by Allison & Busby and features a new character, Enid Nightshade.\n\n;Plot\nMildred Hubble returns to Miss Cackle's Academy for Witches for the Summer Term of her first year. Miss Cackle has trusted Mildred to look after new girl Enid Nightshade and help her settle in. Mildred starts showing Enid around the academy, only to discover that Enid has smuggled a [[monkey]] into school with her. During the assembly that follows, Miss Cackle announces her birthday celebration.\n\nDuring a chanting lesson with [[Miss Bat (The Worst Witch)|Miss Bat]] after assembly, Enid deliberately sings awkwardly and out of tune, causing Mildred to burst into hysterical laughter. Mildred is sent to Miss Cackle's office. When going up to her room, Mildred checks on Enid's monkey, causing it to escape. Mildred chases it down the stairs and bumps into Miss Hardbroom, who sends her to the library to study.\n\nAfter spotting the monkey on top of one of the castle [[towers]] Mildred jumps onto her broomstick. Miss Hardbroom turns the monkey into its original form, a normal regulation [[black cat]]. Enid secretly reveals to Mildred that she turned the cat into a monkey for fun.\n\nOn Sports Day, Mildred and Enid become partners. Enid places a spell on Mildred's pole, so in the pole-vaulting contest, Mildred springs high into the air and lands into Miss Hardbroom's study via the window. Moments later, Miss Cackle, Miss Hardbroom, and Miss Drill arrive and Miss Cackle angrily says that if there is any more bother from Mildred that term, she will be expelled.\n\nDetermined to avoid expulsion for the rest of the term, Mildred refuses every daring suggestion Enid makes. Enid decides to skip Miss Cackle's boring birthday celebration and hides in a store cupboard, pulling Mildred in with her. Ethel Hallow locks the door behind them.\n\nInside the cupboard, the two girls find an old broomstick that they use to fly out of a slit-window leading into the assembly hall. As luck has it, Maud is on stage, having been chosen to recite the first years' contribution to the recital. Maud introduces Mildred and Enid as a surprise broomstick display item. The display is a disaster, but Miss Cackle decides it is the thought that counts, and praises them highly.  The three girls become friends.\n\n===''A Bad Spell for the Worst Witch''===\n''A Bad Spell for the Worst Witch'' ({{ISBN|978-0-7226-5763-8}}) was published in 1982. It features Ethel Hallow's little sister, Sybil Hallow, and her friend Clarice Crow.\n\n;Plot\nMildred Hubble returns to Miss Cackle's Academy for Witches for her second year, determined to lose her embarrassing reputation as \"the worst witch in the school\". After Maud Spellbody and Enid Nightshade arrive, the three bump into two first-years (one of whom reminds Mildred very strongly of someone, the other with [[ginger]] frizzy hair in [[bunches]]). The one who seems familiar bursts into tears and clings onto Mildred when she hears that many of the teachers (including Miss Hardbroom) are quite strict. Mildred also accidentally slips a made-up story about Miss Hardbroom turning a student into a frog when she was just two seconds late for a lesson. To the girl's horror, they also learn that they have Miss Hardbroom for another year.\n\nThe next morning, a fire bell rings. Mildred scrambles into her clothes but notices outside her window Miss Hardbroom standing in the playground surrounded by hazy purple smoke. Thinking she is in a state of shock, Mildred tries to douse her in freezing cold water but the bucket slips off her broomstick and lands with a clang on Miss Hardbroom's head. After witnessing the incident, Ethel Hallow confronts Mildred at lunchtime, saying that the girl she told the frog story to was her younger sister, Sybil. After prodding at Mildred, Mildred loses her temper and insults Ethel's family (\"All you Hallows are weeds, weeds, weeds!\").\n\nAfter an unfortunate flying lesson, where Tabby makes another terrifying attempt to avoid sitting on the end of the broomstick, Miss Hardbroom sends Mildred to her room to calm down. When sitting in her bed, however, Mildred accidentally falls asleep and does not hear Ethel creeping into her room.\nMildred is awoken by her bedroom door shutting, only to find that everything looks giant-sized, even Tabby. Peeking in the mirror, she finds that somebody has turned her into a frog. When jumping onto her bed, the frog-Mildred notices a tatty handful of weeds on her pillow, no doubt left by Ethel as a reference to her family's insult and why she turned her into the frog.\n\nPanicking, Mildred squeezes under the gap under her bedroom door and hops off to a potions lesson, where everyone has noticed her disappearance. Miss Hardbroom, however, discovers her and puts her in a jar. During the lesson, Mildred manages to escape from the jar and hops over to Ethel's desk, where she drinks an [[invisibility]] [[potion]]. Taking advantage of her invisibility, the frog-Mildred hops out of the academy and lands in the lily pond on the castle grounds.\n\nThere, Mildred meets another frog who also was a human once called Algernon Rowan-Webb. Algernon reveals that he was turned into a frog by a fellow magician after an argument. Algernon also reveals that the one thing he craves is some toast and crumpets with butter.\n\nPromising to return for him, Mildred hops back up to the academy. Maud and Enid instantly recognise her and take her to Ethel, who reluctantly turns her back into a human. Miss Hardbroom comes by and Ethel tells her that she caught Maud, Enid, and Mildred sneaking around the school. Miss Hardbroom is about to give Mildred a punishment when she notices that Mildred's feet are still invisible. Mildred tells her what really happened. Miss Hardbroom tells Mildred and Ethel to report to her office the next day.\n\nIn the morning, Miss Hardbroom bans both Mildred and Ethel from attending the [[Halloween]] ceremonies \u2013 the only chance Mildred would have had to come into contact with a magician who could turn Algernon back into a human. Mildred feels she has no choice but to kidnap somebody who is going to the Halloween festival. She tricks a third-year witch, Griselda Blackwood, into looking under her bed for an imaginary [[beetle]] where Mildred ties her up and takes her cat.\n\nLater, Ethel discovers Griselda being held captive in Mildred's room and the two fly off to the festival to turn Mildred in. Mildred gives herself away and barges up to Mr Hellibore and gives him the box that contains Algernon. Mr Hellibore, one of Algernon's fellow magicians at the time of his transformation, turns him back to his human form.\n\nAs a last request from Mildred, Mr Hellibore magics up a pot of tea along with some toast and crumpets with butter. The three head off to enjoy the supper.\n\n===''The Worst Witch All at Sea''===\n''The Worst Witch All at Sea'' ({{ISBN|978-0-670-83253-8}}) was published in 1993. It is the only book in the series not set in Miss Cackle's Academy for Witches, but by the sea instead.\n\n;Plot\nMildred Hubble returns to Miss Cackle's Academy for Witches for the Summer Term of her second year. Instead of the usual black-and-grey-checked dresses, Miss Hardbroom persuaded Miss Cackle to change them to plain black. After crash-landing in a pile of snow and meeting up with her best friends, Maud Spellbody and Enid Nightshade, Ethel Hallow appears and tells Mildred that Miss Cackle wants to see her.\n\nMiss Cackle suggests to Mildred that she replaces Tabby. Last term, a third-year witch, Fenella Feverfew, transferred to Miss Pentangle's Academy several mountaintops away and left behind her sleek [[black cat]], Ebony, since they have owls at Miss Pentangle's instead of black cats. Down in the kitchens, Mildred reluctantly hands over Tabby to Miss [[Tapioca]] (to catch mice), who gives her Ebony in return. Mildred is too upset to tell either Maud or Enid about it.\nMiss Hardbroom also announces that Mr Rowan-Webb, the frog-magician whom Mildred saved from the lilypond the previous term, has invited all the second-years to spend a week's holiday at his castle, Gloom Castle at Grim Cove.\n\nUnable to bear the thought of a week without Tabby, on the morning before the girls set out for Grim Cove, Mildred sneaks down into the school kitchens, lets Ebony out of his cage and instead hides Tabby inside.\n\nWhen they reach Gloom Castle, they find that it is falling apart: the armchairs have springs and stuffing sticking out and there are no proper beds (apart from one, which Ethel Hallow soon claims) other than old sleeping-bags, piles of pillows, and what appear to be hospital trolleys. Mildred gets an old sleeping-bag under the window, and manages to divert attention away from Tabby.\n\nMildred spots a boat attached to a [[Breakwater (structure)|breakwater]] and decides to hide Tabby in the cabin of the boat. After a wonderful day on the beach, Mildred tries to sneak some [[kippers]] to Tabby, but Ethel catches Mildred, who pretends to be looking for some mythical treasure on Cat's Head Rock in front of the [[cove]] in the boat on the breakwater. As the two head back up the cliff stairs, they witness Miss Hardbroom flying down to the beach on her broomstick with her own black cat, Morgana. Morgana runs to the boat and feeds on the kippers that were meant for Tabby. Miss Hardbroom spots both Tabby in the cabin and Morgana eating the fish. Stepping on board to investigate, she slips on a kipper, bangs her head and falls unconscious.\n\nSneaking out to feed Tabby again, Mildred is confronted by Ethel, who snidely tells her that she untied the boat and let it drift out to sea. Mildred manages to get to the boat where she discovers not only Tabby, but the comatose Miss Hardbroom. Minutes after falling onto the boat, they bump into Cat's Head Rock. Mildred ties the boat onto an odd-looking chunk of rock and falls asleep.\n\nWhen she awakens, she finds that Maud and Enid have discovered them. Mildred tells them that there is something strange about the rock the boat is tied to. They pull at it and find that it is the mythical treasure chest. \nWhen they get back, Miss Hardbroom has revived and her injured head is bandaged. The contents of the treasure chest are used to repair Gloom Castle and Mildred is given Tabby back as a reward.\n\nMildred enjoys the rest of the holidays, feeling like \"the luckiest girl in the world instead of the worst witch in the school\".\n\n===''The Worst Witch Saves the Day''===\n''The Worst Witch Saves the Day'' ({{ISBN|978-0-14-138218-0}}) was published in 2005. It features Agatha Cackle disguised as new teacher Miss Granite.\n\n;Plot\nMildred Hubble is returning to Miss Cackle's Academy for Witches on the first day of her third year. After meeting up with her friends, Maud Spellbody and Enid Nightshade, Mildred sees that Maud's hair is curly (she borrowed a hairstyling brush from her aunt) and they also learn that they will have a new form-teacher this year other than Miss Hardbroom.\n\nThey see in assembly that their new form-teacher will be [[List of minor The Worst Witch characters#Agatha Cackle|Miss Granite]] (who was hired by Miss Cackle after [[Miss Gribble (The Worst Witch)|Miss Gribble]] failed to show discipline and against Miss Hardbroom's advice). Miss Granite is described as being very strange-looking and having \"a huge cloud of orange curls\n\" and also wearing \"enormous purple-tinted glasses and a short cape with a collar turned up so high that you couldn't see much of her face at all\". Miss Granite speaks in a very high-pitched, squeaky voice that shocks everyone including Ethel Hallow.\n\nMildred unravels her [[pigtails]] to try out Maud's styling brush. Maud and Enid find her with her hair loose and a chunk of her hair tangled up with the brush in a huge mess. Ethel comes in and volunteers to help. However, the \"help\" amounts to taking a pair of scissors and chopping off both the styling brush and the messy hair.\n\nEthel later offers to help Mildred again in her hair predicament. She formulates a [[potion]] that she claims will restore Mildred's hair to its rightful length. Mildred applies the potion that night and just when she is dropping off to sleep, her hair starts growing longer and longer by the minute, engulfing the whole school. Miss Hardbroom comes to investigate, states that Mildred is having \"a bad hair day\", manages to stop the hair growing and cuts it to its rightful length and vapourises the swathes of hair that had engulfed the whole school.\n\nIn a flying lesson, Ethel steals Tabby (who has been suffering a [[nervous breakdown]] as a result of the hair incident) and hides him on the roof in front of Miss Granite's study's window.\n\nThat night, when trying to recover Tabby, Mildred is locked in a cupboard by someone who seems to be Miss Cackle but is actually Miss Cackle's identical twin Agatha Cackle, who sneaked into the school disguised as Miss Granite. Agatha is trying to turn all the teachers and pupils into snails. Mildred manages to turn herself into an [[ant]], sneaks out of the cupboard and goes to Maud's room, where she tries unsuccessfully to wake her. Fortunately, she is able to attract Maud and Enid's attention by using ink-blots to write two notes \u2013 \"HELP NOT ANT\" attracting their attention to her and \"FORGOT SPEL\" clarifying her dilemma \u2013 and Maud and Enid turn her back into a human. Mildred tells them what is going on and, just as Agatha is about to turn Miss Cackle into a snail, Mildred turns her into a snail herself. They also bump into Miss Hardbroom, who had been away.\n\nMiss Hardbroom suggests that Miss Cackle poses as Agatha and invites Agatha's rebellious [[coven]] in, whereupon Mildred and the others will turn them all into snails, which happens. As Mildred, Maud, and Enid go back to bed they say they want Miss Hardbroom as form-teacher. She suddenly appears in front of them and is friendly for a brief moment before strictly telling them to get back to bed with no candles on.\n\n===''The Worst Witch to the Rescue''===\n''The Worst Witch to the Rescue'' ({{ISBN|978-0-14-138301-9}}) was published in 2007 and features Ethel Hallow's only friend, Drusilla Paddock, in a largely increased role since her brief cameo in ''The Worst Witch All at Sea''.\n\n;Plot\nEthel Hallow is returning to Miss Cackle's Academy for Witches for the Summer Term of her third year. Miss Hardbroom had previously set them a holiday project, but Ethel is doing exactly what Miss Hardbroom told them not to do: trying to think up a project in five minutes flat on the way back to school. Ethel spots Mildred Hubble crash-landed in a tree and manages to help her steady herself. Mildred explains to Ethel her project: a spell that can make animals talk, though it can only work on animals that fit into 25 centimetres and only lasts for two weeks. When helping Mildred out of the tree, Ethel knocks Mildred's luggage out of the tree. While Mildred tries to get Tabby, who had scampered up the tree, Ethel scoops up Mildred's project folder and art bag and her 30 [[coloured pencils]]. \nOn the way there, Mildred finds her friends Maud Spellbody and Enid Nightshade. When Mildred tells them about Ethel being nice for a change, Enid suggests she may have taken a \"niceness course\" during the holidays. Maud and Enid become suspicious when they catch Mildred talking to someone or something in her cat basket.\n\nThe girls find that their new form mistress is called [[Miss Mould]], who has a \"soft and kindly\" voice and \"short mousy hair parted in the middle and pulled into a [[ponytail]] at her neck\". She is a great relief from the horrifically strict Miss Hardbroom and the extremely weird Miss Granite whom they had had the previous term. Mildred sits next to [[Drusilla Paddock]], who swaps places with Ethel after Miss Mould tells Ethel her coils are too short. Minutes later, a [[maraca]]-like noise echoes through the classroom. Mildred finds that her coils have turned into five [[rattlesnakes]]. Miss Mould gets the whole class outside while Ethel stays inside and evaporates the rattlesnakes. Just then, Miss Hardbroom appears and Miss Mould explains what happened. Miss Hardbroom sends Mildred to her room and bans her from art lessons for the rest of the term. Mildred runs to her room where she figures out it must have been Ethel who turned her pot and coils into the snakes out of [[jealousy]].\nThe next day, in a lesson with Miss Hardbroom, the girls are presenting their projects to the class. Ethel goes first but her project is the same as Mildred's. Mildred shouts to Miss Hardbroom that Ethel had stolen her project. Miss Hardbroom opens Mildred's project folder but finds only lots of sheets of paper with smiley faces drawn on them in different colours. Miss Hardbroom \"transfers\" Mildred to her room.\n\nLater, Mildred finds that the creature inside her cat basket, a [[tortoise]] called Speedy whom she had used her spell on, can still speak. She renames him [[Einstein]] and Einstein tells her that he overheard her conversation with Ethel inside the tree. After Mildred runs to tell Maud and Enid the good news, Mildred accidentally leaves her bedroom door open and Einstein escapes. While plodding along the corridor he is discovered by Drusilla Paddock, who takes him to Ethel's room. While Ethel and Drusilla talk, it is revealed that Ethel did indeed take Mildred's project and had also \"tried out\" a snake spell on Mildred's pot and coils in art. Einstein overhears everything.\n\nWhen they are taking Einstein back to Mildred, Ethel eavesdrops on what Mildred is telling Maud and Enid. After discovering that Einstein can still speak and had overheard the conversation between Ethel and Mildred about the project, and that Einstein only has one more day before the spell wears off and he becomes mute forever, Ethel orders Drusilla to hide Einstein in the hollow [[pine tree]] outside the school gates. Einstein is put into a cardboard box that also contains a small green frog called Cyril, the animal whom Ethel had used in her demonstration. Cyril escapes and hops to Mildred's room. Cyril tells Mildred that Drusilla hid Einstein in the hollow pine tree outside the school gates and that he overheard several conversations about stealing projects and turning pots into snakes.\n\nAfter releasing Cyril into the woods, Mildred gets on her broomstick and, during a violent thunderstorm, finds and rescues Einstein. On landing she is confronted by Miss Hardbroom, who takes Mildred and Einstein inside and, after hearing part of the incidents from Mildred, sets an interview with Mildred and Ethel the next morning.\nThe next morning, Mildred goes to Miss Cackle's office where Einstein, resting in Miss Cackle's overflowing [[in-tray]], awakes and tells Miss Cackle and Miss Hardbroom that he overheard the conversation between Ethel and Mildred in the tree. He also says that he heard Ethel telling Drusilla that she had tried out a snake spell on Mildred's coils and had taken Mildred's project, copied it out in her own writing, and then thrown it in the kitchen bins. Ethel sifts through the rubbish and eventually finds Mildred's tea-stained project. Miss Hardbroom makes Ethel apologise to Mildred in assembly in front of the whole year as an alternative to being expelled for [[cheating]] as well as for her actions that put herself and Mildred in great danger.\n\nDuring a broomstick-flying lesson, Mildred reveals to Maud and Enid that Miss Cackle had provided Miss Mould's classroom with a proper [[kiln]] and craft room and she also got to keep Einstein as a pet. As the clock strikes midday, Mildred sprints into her room and hears Einstein speak for the last time in his raspy little voice (\"I'm glad I belong to you\"), before munching on his carrot and going silent forever.\n\n===''The Worst Witch and the Wishing Star''===\n''The Worst Witch and the Wishing Star'' (Scholastic UK, {{ISBN|978-0-141351995}}; another(?), {{ISBN|978-0-141383996}}) was released by Scholastic UK on 3 October 2013.<ref>[http://shop.scholastic.co.uk/products/93355 \"''The Worst Witch and the Wishing Star'' by Jill Murphy: For ages 7 to 9\"].

On that first night Maud spots a shooting star and Mildred makes a wish followed by Miss Hardbroom who does the same reluctantly. On the first lantern monitor shift Mildred is given a holdall containing safety objects in it. When she reaches the gates to finish the job Mildred spots a stray dog, who she names Star, she takes him to her bedroom as a secret pet, much to the disapproval of Tabby.\n\nDuring the weeks that follow Mildred, realising that Star is well behaved and calm on a broomstick, trains him to do various tricks with her. Maud and Enid, who realise Mildred isn't spending much time with them, soon discover about Star and are amazed by the tricks Mildred has taught him. Ethel, suspicious about Mildred hiding something in her holdall, reaches into it to discover Star was hidden in it and the both of them collapse\ninto the lanterns igniting the costumes Form Five have made for the talent competition.\n\nMiss Hardbroom, furious, sends Ethel and Mildred along with Star on a lead to Miss Cackle's office for what they had done then Maud and Enid explain about Star's tricks on the broom. Miss Cackle accepts the replacing talent and the next day the competition took place with the schools showing their talents. When it's Mildred's turn she amazes the judges with Star's tricks and wins the competition and the swimming pool. When the pupils go back to their school Miss Cackle allows Mildred to keep Star as her broomstick companion as a special privilege. Mildred later explains to Miss Hardbroom that she wished for Star on the shooting star at the beginning of term which doesn't annoy her as she wished on the star for them to win the competition. The story concludes with the teachers celebrating their victory and at the same time Miss Hardbroom's birthday.\n\n=== ''First Prize for the Worst Witch'' ===\n''First Prize for the Worst Witch'' ({{ISBN|9780141355092}}) was published in 2018.\n\nThe book deals with Mildred's graduation at the end of her fourth year. Its writing was delayed when Murphy underwent cancer treatment.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jan/25/jill-murphy-worst-witch-career-classic-children-author |title=Jill Murphy: 'I just wanted to have a book on the shelf' |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |first=Alison |last=Flood |date=25 January 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Setting==\nThe stories mainly take place within the walls of Miss Cackle's Academy for Witches, a girls-only boarding magic school that is described in the books as a stone castle on top of a mountain, surrounded by pine forest.\n\nThe school year is divided into two terms: the Winter term (September\u2013January) and the Summer term (March\u2013July), with a month's holiday between them. Students starts at Cackle's at the age of 12, and finish at the age of 17, for a total of five school years. The students arrive at the start of the term by flying broomsticks, except for the new first years, who walk through walker's gate as they can't fly yet. Halfway through the first term, the first years are each presented with a black kitten- Mildred receives a grey-and-black tabby cat as they apparently ran out of purely black cats- which they teach to ride the broomstick. The first book postulates that the cats weren't for any practical purpose except to keep tradition going, and in ''Wishing Star'', a group of elder witches note that there is no restriction on what animal a witch must have as her flight companion, with cats only being traditional as they are discreet and easy to care for, which leads to Mildred being permitted to fly with her dog, Star, after he shows greater broom aptitude than her cat Tabby. At the end of the first year, each pupil receives a copy of ''The Popular Book of Spells'', a three-inch thick volume bound in black leather. This was not really to be used, as they already had paperback editions for the classroom, but like the cats, it's another piece of tradition. At the end of the fifth and final year, students sit the exams for the W.H.C. (Witches' Higher Certificate), and most pupils were awarded with the certificate.\n\nThe first book says that the school winter uniform is composed of \"black gymslips, black stockings, black hob-nailed boots, grey shirts and black-and-grey ties.\" The first book also postulates that \"the only touches of colour [on the uniforms] were the sashes round their gymslips \u2013 a different colour for each house, although the houses are not named \u2013 and the school badge, which was a black cat sitting on a yellow moon.\" In the summer term, originally the girls wore grey-and-black checked dresses, but this was changed from ''Worst Witch All At Sea'' onwards to a simple black dress as Ms Hardbroom felt that the original design was too frivolous.\n\n==Characters==\n{{main|List of The Worst Witch characters}}\n\n===Mildred Hubble===\nMildred \"Millie\" Hubble is the protagonist of the series. She is a good-hearted, but bungling young witch-in-training, who never seems to get anything right. She is friends with Maud Spellbody and Enid Nightshade and has a strong rivalry with Ethel Hallow. It is Miss Hardbroom, her potions teacher, who calls her \"The Worst Witch\".\n\nJill Murphy's illustrations shows that she is tall, with long brown [[braid|plaits]]. Some illustrations shows that she frequently fails to tie her bootlaces and the colour ones that her uniform sash is red. According to the author, Mildred's appearance is based on her own appearance as a teenager. She remembers: \"Mildred is based on myself when I had plaits so long that I could sit on them!\"<ref name=Q&A>{{cite web|title=World Book Day Q&A with Jill Murphy|url=http://www.gransnet.com/forums/webchats/a1204459-World-Book-Day-Q-A-with-Jill-Murphy|website=Gransnet|accessdate=19 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Maud Spellbody===\nMaud Spellbody is Mildred's best friend. She is fiercely loyal to Mildred and assists her on most of her adventures, often against her better judgment. Maud is a decent and considerate person, but grows weary of Mildred's incessant clumsiness and often lectures her on how to improve herself. Ironically, Maud is not a perfect student, as she is also responsible for a laughing potion going wrong, as she along with Mildred had no idea how to make one. ''The Worst Witch All at Sea'' reveals her last name to be Spellbody, rather than \"Moonshine\", which is what the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] series dubbed her.\n\nThe author's illustrations shows that she is a short, plump girl with wide glasses who always wears her hair in bunches. The colour illustrations reveal that she is blonde and her uniform sash is yellow. According to the author, Maud is based on her best friend as a teenager, a girl called Elizabeth.<ref name=Q&A/>\n\n===Ethel Hallow===\nEthel Hallow is Mildred's acid-tongued rival. She does very well in class, comes from a prominent witch family, and gives the impression of being a model student. However, she is spoiled, snobbish and vindictive although able to [[turn on the charm]] and act sweet and innocent when the teachers are near, playing the role of a victim with Mildred as the bully. Up until ''The Worst Witch to the Rescue'', she is Miss Hardbroom's favourite student; however, in the same book, she is exposed as a cheat and a liar, and thus has to watch her step lest she incur her teacher's wrath.\n\nThe book illustrations shows that she is a tall, skinny and sharp-faced young girl. Her hair is mousy brown and her uniform sash is purple.\n\nIn the first book of the series, it is revealed without explanation that Ethel and Mildred were enemies prior to the story. Ethel takes pleasure in taunting Mildred about her inability to train her cat into riding a broomstick, and Mildred responds by turning her into a pig. From then on Mildred and Ethel resent each other, and Ethel vows to get Mildred expelled. So far she has been unsuccessful. In the first five books she appears to have no friends, although her young sister, Sybil, makes an appearance in ''A Bad Spell for the Worst Witch''. A friend of Ethel's, Drusilla, makes a brief appearance in ''The Worst Witch All at Sea'' and later plays a bigger part in ''The Worst Witch to the Rescue'', where she hides Mildred's tortoise up a tree. Ethel is Mildred's arch-enemy.\n\n===Enid Nightshade===\nAnother of Mildred's closest friends. She makes her debut in ''The Worst Witch Strikes Again'' after she is transferred to Miss Cackle's Academy and Mildred is assigned to look after her, to the irritation of Miss Hardbroom. At first Mildred thinks Enid will simply be a nuisance and a pain, but she turns out to be a wild practical joker. Her attempts to make Mildred like her only result in Mildred getting into trouble, for example, turning her cat into a monkey and enchanting a vaulting pole which catapults Mildred into the air and into Miss Hardbroom's study.\n\nEnid is tall, well-built and rather muscular for a girl. She has large limbs and fair hair, usually in one long plait. In the TV series she is small and waiflike with dark hair. She takes an instant liking to Mildred and hopes to become her friend, implying that she is not a judgmental girl. Overall she is friendly and kind-hearted, but sometimes oversteps the mark in her attempt to befriend and help people, and being nice. Aside from Mildred herself, Enid is considered the second worst witch in the Academy, as she too is hopeless when it comes to broomstick riding and magic.\n\n===Miss Hardbroom===\nMiss Hardbroom is the fearsome deputy headmistress of Miss Cackle's Academy and the clear [[power behind the throne]]. She is Mildred's form mistress in first form and through various combinations of events continues to be her form mistress throughout the series. Tall, bony and sour-faced, she strikes fear into the pupils' hearts. \"HB\", as the girls refer to her, seems to have a particular resentment of Mildred. Miss Hardbroom frequently praises and rewards Ethel Hallow, and frequently rebukes Mildred in front of the other students. It is Miss Hardbroom who gives Mildred the title of \"the worst witch in the school\".\n\nIn the later books Miss Hardbroom's humanity comes through on occasion, in incidents such as her accident in ''The Worst Witch All at Sea'', the restoring of Mildred's hair to its rightful length in ''The Worst Witch Saves the Day'', and her admitting of her error of judgment at the end of ''The Worst Witch to the Rescue''.\n\nMiss Hardbroom usually has her hair tied up in a tight bun which makes her face look really long.\nMiss Hardbroom is very strict on all of the girls except Ethel Hallow, the teachers' pet.\n\n===Miss Cackle===\nAmelia Cackle (Ada Cackle in the [[The Worst Witch (2017 TV series)|2017 TV series]]) is the kind-hearted headmistress of the Academy. Plump and pleasant, Miss Cackle is more lenient towards Mildred when she is in trouble, and rather than intimidate the girl as Miss Hardbroom does, Miss Cackle gives long, sorrowful lectures which causes Mildred to feel guilty for the trouble she is in. Her birthday is celebrated at her beloved Academy, and her students believe it to be the most boring event of the year. Despite her kind heart, Miss Cackle can be intimidating when she wants to, and has occasionally broken into fits of rage at Mildred, most notably both when Mildred humiliated the reputation of the Academy by ruining a broomstick display to honour the Wizards' Council (Ethel had cursed Mildred to ensure she would make a fool of herself), and after she incorrectly believed Mildred was cheating at the school sport's day, after Enid cast an improper spell upon Mildred to make sure she won the pole-vaulting competition. However, these moments of anger are few and short-lived.\n\nMiss Cackle has an evil twin sister named Agatha Cackle, who is bitterly jealous of her position of authority at the Academy. In the first of the series, Agatha and her [[coven]] of rebellious witches plotted to overthrow Miss Cackle and turn her, the staff, and students into frogs as they slept. Mildred caught them as they brewed their invisibility potion, by turning them into snails and taking them to the school to show Miss Cackle. Ashamed that her own sister would break the Witches' Code, she ordered Agatha to accept defeat and live the code like all decent witches. Agatha reluctantly co-operated. She tries to take over again at the end of series 1, by pretending to be Miss Cackle and dragging Mildred out of the classroom by her ear.\n\n===Drusilla Paddock===\nThe \"best friend\" of Ethel Hallow, with whom she is often paired up. Drusilla appears only briefly in ''The Worst Witch All at Sea'', but her role in the TV series and in the later books increases greatly. Drusilla is a horrible, vindictive bully, but lacks the acid-tongued spite of Ethel, and seems to be in great awe of her. Their \"friendship\" seems to be more of an alliance or a form of servitude: Ethel and Drusilla are not true friends, they have stuck beside each other because nobody else can bear to be around them. Drusilla seems to have no will of her own. Drusilla does everything Ethel orders her to, and in one book (''The Worst Witch to the Rescue'') she steals Mildred's beloved pet [[tortoise]] and hides it in a tree. In the TV series, she and Ethel briefly end their friendship when Drusilla sides with Mildred and her friends. They make up at the end of the episode though.\n\n==Adaptations==\n\n===Television film===\n{{main|The Worst Witch (film)}}\n\nIn 1986, the first book in the series was converted to a made-for-television film on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] starring [[Fairuza Balk]], [[Tim Curry]], [[Diana Rigg]], and [[Charlotte Rae]]. Though a British film, it also aired in the USA on [[HBO]]. The film followed the plot of the first book of the series, portraying the incidents of Mildred turning herself invisible and turning Ethel into a pig, Miss Cackle's evil twin sister Agatha plotting to take over the school, and the Grand Wizard viewing the Halloween Broomstick formation (sabotaged by Ethel's faulty broom she lent to Mildred). It was shot at [[St. Michael's College, Tenbury|St. Michael's College]] in [[Tenbury Wells]]. This holiday special later aired on the [[Disney Channel]] every year for [[Halloween]] until the late 1990s. Its opening song, \"Growing Up Isn't Easy\", was sung by [[Bonnie Langford]]; its music was composed by [[Charles Strouse]] and its lyrics were written by [[Don Black (lyricist)|Don Black]]. Their other musical number was \"Anything Can Happen on Halloween\", sung by [[Tim Curry]]. [[Denis King]] composed its incidental music score. He also wrote the song \"My Little School\".\n\n===Television series (1998\u20132001)===\n''[[The Worst Witch (1998 TV series)|The Worst Witch]]'', a TV series based on the books, starring [[Georgina Sherrington]] and [[Felicity Jones]] as Mildred Hubble and Ethel Hallow respectively, was broadcast from 1998 to 2001. It was shot in [[Montreal]], London and [[Cardiff]]. The series is mostly shot in studio in London, with some episodes filmed in Montreal, [[Quebec]], Canada. The exteriors of Cackle's Academy used [[Castell Coch]], a castle located near Cardiff. The courtyard was filmed at [[Loseley Park]], near [[Guildford]]. Inside the school (Great Hall, classrooms etc.) was filmed at [[Twickenham Studios]].\n\n====Spin-offs====\nWhen it was no longer realistic that Mildred would still be at school, the series relocated her to a magical university in [[Cambridge]] and was retitled ''[[Weirdsister College]]: The Further Adventures of the Worst Witch,'' and saw the return of Felicity Jones as a reinvented Ethel Hallow.\n\nIn 2004, a new series based on the 1998 series was made, entitled ''[[The New Worst Witch]]''. It centred on the adventures of Mildred's equally bungling cousin, Henrietta \"Hettie\" Hubble, played by [[Alice Connor]], also set at Cackle's Academy.\n\n===Television series (2017\u2013present)===\nA new version of ''[[The Worst Witch (2017 TV series)|The Worst Witch]]'' TV series began in 2017 airing on [[CBBC]], this one starring [[Bella Ramsey]] as Mildred Hubble, [[Claire Higgins]] as Miss Cackle, and [[Raquel Cassidy]] as Miss Hardbroom.\n\n===Stage Adaptation (2018\u20132019)===\nA musical stage production called ''Worst Witch Live'' was shown at the [[Royal & Derngate]] Theatre in Northampton from 27 November to 30 December 2018.  In February 2019, the show began to tour the UK across 16 different venues. In April 2019 Kenny Wax Family Entertainment announced that ''Worst Witch Live'' would be showing at the [[Vaudeville Theatre]] in the West End from 24 July to 8 September 2019. This version is presented is a publicity play written by Mildred and acted out by the students and staff playing themselves, initially recreating Mildred's first year at school, although the second half takes on a metafictional angle as Agatha Cackle \"infiltrates\" the play and attempts to stage a coup of the magical government.\n\n''Worst Witch Live'' stars [https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3930361/?ref_=nv_sr_1?ref_=nv_sr_1 Danielle Bird] as Mildred Hubble, [[imdbname:1118833|Polly Lister]] as Miss Cackle/Agatha, [https://www.mandy.com/actor/profile/rachel-heaton Rachel Heaton] as Miss Hardbroom and [https://www.actorum.com/actor/rosie-abraham/ Rosie Abraham] as Ethel Hallow.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Children's literature|Fantasy}}\n* [[Boarding schools in fiction]]\n* [[School story]]\n* [[Little Witch Academia]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist |25em |refs=\n<ref name=images>\n{{cite web |title=Jill Murphy: Biography |work=Images of Delight: Original artwork from children's book illustrators |url=http://www.imagesofdelight.com/gallery14.htm |accessdate=17 April 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929190352/http://www.imagesofdelight.com/client.asp?id=56 |archivedate=29 September 2007}} <!--update 2013-10-24--></ref>\n<ref name=\"new_series_2017_prod\">\n{{cite web|title=Netflix Sets Tween Series \u2018Worst Witch,\u2019 \u2018Horse Mystery Project\u2019 For 2017|url=https://variety.com/2016/digital/news/netflix-tween-series-worst-witch-horse-mystery-project-1201849203|website=Variety|accessdate=9 July 2018}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{worldcat id|fast-962667|Mildred Hubble}}\n\n{{The Worst Witch}}\n\n<!--Mildred Hubbell?-->\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Worst Witch}}\n[[Category:Children's fantasy novels]]\n[[Category:British children's novels]]\n[[Category:Series of children's books]]\n[[Category:Contemporary fantasy novels]]\n[[Category:The Worst Witch|*]]\n[[Category:Witchcraft in written fiction]]\n[[Category:Child characters in television]]\n[[Category:Child characters in literature]] <!--Mildred Hubbell?-->\n[[Category:Characters in children's literature]]\n[[Category:Novels set in schools]]\n[[Category:British novels adapted into films]]\n[[Category:1974 children's books]]\n[[Category:Allison and Busby books]]\n", "text_old": "{{about|the novel series}}\n{{EngvarB|date=September 2017}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2017}}\n{{italic title}}\n{{Infobox book series\n| name             = ''The Worst Witch''\n| image            = The Worst Witch Book Series Covers.jpg\n| image_caption    = The covers from the first seven books, shown in the publication order.\n| books            = The Worst Witch<br>The Worst Witch Strikes Again<br>A Bad Spell for the Worst Witch<br>The Worst Witch All at Sea<br>The Worst Witch Saves the Day<br>The Worst Witch to the Rescue<br>The Worst Witch and the Wishing Star<br>First Prize for The Worst Witch\n| author           = [[Jill Murphy]]\n| editors          =\n| title_orig       = \n| translator       = \n| illustrator      = Jill Murphy\n| cover_artist     = Jill Murphy\n| country          = United Kingdom\n| language         = English\n| genre            = [[Fantasy literature|Fantasy]], [[Children's literature|children's books]]\n| discipline       =\n| publisher        = [[Allison & Busby]] (original)<br>[[Puffin Books]] (current)\n| pub_date         = 1974\u20132018\n| english_pub_date = \n| media_type       = \n| number_of_books  = 8\n| list_books       = \n| preceded by      = \n| followed by      = \n}}\n'''''The Worst Witch''''' is a series of children's books written and illustrated by [[Jill Murphy]].

A [[The Worst Witch (1998 TV series)|TV series based on the books]] aired from 1998 to 2001, and has inspired two spin-offs, ''[[Weirdsister College]]'', aired in 2001, and ''[[The New Worst Witch]]'', aired in 2005. In January 2017, a [[The Worst Witch (2017 TV series)|new series]] premiered in some markets as a [[CBBC]], [[ZDF]], and [[Netflix]] co-production and as of July 2017 it was released internationally on Netflix as a [[List of original programs distributed by Netflix|Netflix Original]].<ref name=\"new_series_2017_prod\" />\n\n==Series overview==\nThe books focus on [[Mildred Hubble]], a young witch who attends Miss Cackle's Academy for Witches, a [[Magic (paranormal)|school of magic]]. Although well-intentioned, Mildred's clumsy personality leads the girl to disastrous situations, and she is thus considered the worst student in the school. The benevolent headmistress, Miss Cackle, is generally  understanding, whereas Mildred's form teacher [[List of The Worst Witch characters#Miss Hardbroom|Miss Hardbroom]] thinks she just isn't trying hard enough. Mildred's friends include [[List of The Worst Witch characters#Maud Spellbody|Maud Spellbody]], a rotund, sensible girl who is always trying to avoid confusion, and [[Enid Nightshade]], a practical joker who is more likely than Mildred to get them all into trouble. The three girls have a strong rivalry with [[List of The Worst Witch characters#Ethel Hallow|Ethel Hallow]], a high-born, snobbish and vindictive classmate.\n\nEach book covers one term at the school. There are two terms each year: the Winter term, from September to January, and the Summer term, from March to July. In ''First Prize for the Worst Witch'', the most recent book, Mildred is in the Summer term of her fourth year.\n \nThe author Jill Murphy began writing ''The Worst Witch'' at the age of 15, while still at school, and based many points of the stories on her own school experiences at [[Ursuline High School, Wimbledon|Ursuline Convent]] in [[Wimbledon, England|Wimbledon]], England, with Singing becoming Chanting, Chemistry becoming Potions and so on.<ref>{{cite news| last = Deeley | first =L.| title =Back on top after a bad spell | work= The Times| date =27 October 2007 | url = http://women.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/women/body_and_soul/article2745146.ece | accessdate =17 April 2008 }}</ref> Recalling how she got the idea for the story, she said: \"My two friends and I used to come home in our dark uniforms, looking very scruffy at the end of the day \u2013 my dark plaits sprouting tufts, with lost hair ribbons.

''The Worst Witch'' was finally published in 1974, when Murphy was 24.\n\n==Books==\n\n===''The Worst Witch''===\n''The Worst Witch'' was first published in 1974 by Allison & Busby, who took the book on after it had been turned down by three other publishers.<ref>Joanna Carey, [http://booksforkeeps.co.uk/issue/136/childrens-books/articles/authorgraph/authorgraph-no136-jill-murphy \"Authorgraph No.136: Jill Murphy\" (interview)], Books For Keeps.</ref><ref name=\"TelegraphInterview2014\"/>\n\n;Plot\nThe novel begins with Mildred Hubble and the upcoming traditional assembly where all of the first-years are given their own black cats that they will teach to ride on their [[broomsticks]] with them. Unlike the other girls, who receive black kittens, Mildred receives a tabby cat, which she simply calls Tabby. The kitten is unable to sit on a broomstick, so Mildred carries Tabby in her bag. Miss Hardbroom disapproves and Mildred has to stop. Afterwards, another witch called Ethel Hallow teases Mildred about it, and dares her to turn her into a frog. Mildred loses her temper and turns Ethel into a pig instead.\n\nIn the next chapter, Mildred and Maud inadvertently make an invisibility potion instead of a laughing potion in their class test.\n\nIn the following chapter, the girls are practising for a broomstick display for [[Halloween]]. Ethel lends Mildred her spare broom, on which she has secretly put a spell. During the Halloween festival, Mildred's broom starts bucking, causing all the girls to fall from their broomsticks. The Chief Magician denounces the academy, and Mildred is summoned to a meeting with Miss Cackle and Miss Hardbroom the next morning. Mildred, fearing expulsion, decides to run away with Tabby.\n\nWhen walking through the forests near the academy, Mildred hears voices through the trees and comes across a group of witches, headed by one who looks like Miss Cackle. After hearing their plot to turn every teacher and student witch in the academy into frogs, Mildred turns the group into snails, packs them into cardboard boxes and takes them back to the academy. At first, Miss Cackle and Miss Hardbroom refuse to believe her, but when Mildred describes the leader, Miss Cackle realises she sounds like her identical twin sister, [[List of minor The Worst Witch characters#Agatha Cackle|Agatha]]. They turn Agatha and the rest of the group back into humans, Mildred's interview is cancelled, and she is praised as a hero to the rest of the academy.\n\n===''The Worst Witch Strikes Again''===\n''The Worst Witch Strikes Again'' was first published in 1980 by Allison & Busby and features a new character, Enid Nightshade.\n\n;Plot\nMildred Hubble returns to Miss Cackle's Academy for Witches for the Summer Term of her first year. Miss Cackle has trusted Mildred to look after new girl Enid Nightshade and help her settle in. Mildred starts showing Enid around the academy, only to discover that Enid has smuggled a [[monkey]] into school with her. During the assembly that follows, Miss Cackle announces her birthday celebration.\n\nDuring a chanting lesson with [[Miss Bat (The Worst Witch)|Miss Bat]] after assembly, Enid deliberately sings awkwardly and out of tune, causing Mildred to burst into hysterical laughter. Mildred is sent to Miss Cackle's office. When going up to her room, Mildred checks on Enid's monkey, causing it to escape. Mildred chases it down the stairs and bumps into Miss Hardbroom, who sends her to the library to study.\n\nAfter spotting the monkey on top of one of the castle [[towers]] Mildred jumps onto her broomstick. Miss Hardbroom turns the monkey into its original form, a normal regulation [[black cat]]. Enid secretly reveals to Mildred that she turned the cat into a monkey for fun.\n\nOn Sports Day, Mildred and Enid become partners. Enid places a spell on Mildred's pole, so in the pole-vaulting contest, Mildred springs high into the air and lands into Miss Hardbroom's study via the window. Moments later, Miss Cackle, Miss Hardbroom, and Miss Drill arrive and Miss Cackle angrily says that if there is any more bother from Mildred that term, she will be expelled.\n\nDetermined to avoid expulsion for the rest of the term, Mildred refuses every daring suggestion Enid makes. Enid decides to skip Miss Cackle's boring birthday celebration and hides in a store cupboard, pulling Mildred in with her. Ethel Hallow locks the door behind them.\n\nInside the cupboard, the two girls find an old broomstick that they use to fly out of a slit-window leading into the assembly hall. As luck has it, Maud is on stage, having been chosen to recite the first years' contribution to the recital. Maud introduces Mildred and Enid as a surprise broomstick display item. The display is a disaster, but Miss Cackle decides it is the thought that counts, and praises them highly.  The three girls become friends.\n\n===''A Bad Spell for the Worst Witch''===\n''A Bad Spell for the Worst Witch'' ({{ISBN|978-0-7226-5763-8}}) was published in 1982. It features Ethel Hallow's little sister, Sybil Hallow, and her friend Clarice Crow.\n\n;Plot\nMildred Hubble returns to Miss Cackle's Academy for Witches for her second year, determined to lose her embarrassing reputation as \"the worst witch in the school\". After Maud Spellbody and Enid Nightshade arrive, the three bump into two first-years (one of whom reminds Mildred very strongly of someone, the other with [[ginger]] frizzy hair in [[bunches]]). The one who seems familiar bursts into tears and clings onto Mildred when she hears that many of the teachers (including Miss Hardbroom) are quite strict. Mildred also accidentally slips a made-up story about Miss Hardbroom turning a student into a frog when she was just two seconds late for a lesson. To the girl's horror, they also learn that they have Miss Hardbroom for another year.\n\nThe next morning, a fire bell rings. Mildred scrambles into her clothes but notices outside her window Miss Hardbroom standing in the playground surrounded by hazy purple smoke. Thinking she is in a state of shock, Mildred tries to douse her in freezing cold water but the bucket slips off her broomstick and lands with a clang on Miss Hardbroom's head. After witnessing the incident, Ethel Hallow confronts Mildred at lunchtime, saying that the girl she told the frog story to was her younger sister, Sybil. After prodding at Mildred, Mildred loses her temper and insults Ethel's family (\"All you Hallows are weeds, weeds, weeds!\").\n\nAfter an unfortunate flying lesson, where Tabby makes another terrifying attempt to avoid sitting on the end of the broomstick, Miss Hardbroom sends Mildred to her room to calm down. When sitting in her bed, however, Mildred accidentally falls asleep and does not hear Ethel creeping into her room.\nMildred is awoken by her bedroom door shutting, only to find that everything looks giant-sized, even Tabby. Peeking in the mirror, she finds that somebody has turned her into a frog. When jumping onto her bed, the frog-Mildred notices a tatty handful of weeds on her pillow, no doubt left by Ethel as a reference to her family's insult and why she turned her into the frog.\n\nPanicking, Mildred squeezes under the gap under her bedroom door and hops off to a potions lesson, where everyone has noticed her disappearance. Miss Hardbroom, however, discovers her and puts her in a jar. During the lesson, Mildred manages to escape from the jar and hops over to Ethel's desk, where she drinks an [[invisibility]] [[potion]]. Taking advantage of her invisibility, the frog-Mildred hops out of the academy and lands in the lily pond on the castle grounds.\n\nThere, Mildred meets another frog who also was a human once called Algernon Rowan-Webb. Algernon reveals that he was turned into a frog by a fellow magician after an argument. Algernon also reveals that the one thing he craves is some toast and crumpets with butter.\n\nPromising to return for him, Mildred hops back up to the academy. Maud and Enid instantly recognise her and take her to Ethel, who reluctantly turns her back into a human. Miss Hardbroom comes by and Ethel tells her that she caught Maud, Enid, and Mildred sneaking around the school. Miss Hardbroom is about to give Mildred a punishment when she notices that Mildred's feet are still invisible. Mildred tells her what really happened. Miss Hardbroom tells Mildred and Ethel to report to her office the next day.\n\nIn the morning, Miss Hardbroom bans both Mildred and Ethel from attending the [[Halloween]] ceremonies \u2013 the only chance Mildred would have had to come into contact with a magician who could turn Algernon back into a human. Mildred feels she has no choice but to kidnap somebody who is going to the Halloween festival. She tricks a third-year witch, Griselda Blackwood, into looking under her bed for an imaginary [[beetle]] where Mildred ties her up and takes her cat.\n\nLater, Ethel discovers Griselda being held captive in Mildred's room and the two fly off to the festival to turn Mildred in. Mildred gives herself away and barges up to Mr Hellibore and gives him the box that contains Algernon. Mr Hellibore, one of Algernon's fellow magicians at the time of his transformation, turns him back to his human form.\n\nAs a last request from Mildred, Mr Hellibore magics up a pot of tea along with some toast and crumpets with butter. The three head off to enjoy the supper.\n\n===''The Worst Witch All at Sea''===\n''The Worst Witch All at Sea'' ({{ISBN|978-0-670-83253-8}}) was published in 1993. It is the only book in the series not set in Miss Cackle's Academy for Witches, but by the sea instead.\n\n;Plot\nMildred Hubble returns to Miss Cackle's Academy for Witches for the Summer Term of her second year. Instead of the usual black-and-grey-checked dresses, Miss Hardbroom persuaded Miss Cackle to change them to plain black. After crash-landing in a pile of snow and meeting up with her best friends, Maud Spellbody and Enid Nightshade, Ethel Hallow appears and tells Mildred that Miss Cackle wants to see her.\n\nMiss Cackle suggests to Mildred that she replaces Tabby. Last term, a third-year witch, Fenella Feverfew, transferred to Miss Pentangle's Academy several mountaintops away and left behind her sleek [[black cat]], Ebony, since they have owls at Miss Pentangle's instead of black cats. Down in the kitchens, Mildred reluctantly hands over Tabby to Miss [[Tapioca]] (to catch mice), who gives her Ebony in return. Mildred is too upset to tell either Maud or Enid about it.\nMiss Hardbroom also announces that Mr Rowan-Webb, the frog-magician whom Mildred saved from the lilypond the previous term, has invited all the second-years to spend a week's holiday at his castle, Gloom Castle at Grim Cove.\n\nUnable to bear the thought of a week without Tabby, on the morning before the girls set out for Grim Cove, Mildred sneaks down into the school kitchens, lets Ebony out of his cage and instead hides Tabby inside.\n\nWhen they reach Gloom Castle, they find that it is falling apart: the armchairs have springs and stuffing sticking out and there are no proper beds (apart from one, which Ethel Hallow soon claims) other than old sleeping-bags, piles of pillows, and what appear to be hospital trolleys. Mildred gets an old sleeping-bag under the window, and manages to divert attention away from Tabby.\n\nMildred spots a boat attached to a [[Breakwater (structure)|breakwater]] and decides to hide Tabby in the cabin of the boat. After a wonderful day on the beach, Mildred tries to sneak some [[kippers]] to Tabby, but Ethel catches Mildred, who pretends to be looking for some mythical treasure on Cat's Head Rock in front of the [[cove]] in the boat on the breakwater. As the two head back up the cliff stairs, they witness Miss Hardbroom flying down to the beach on her broomstick with her own black cat, Morgana. Morgana runs to the boat and feeds on the kippers that were meant for Tabby. Miss Hardbroom spots both Tabby in the cabin and Morgana eating the fish. Stepping on board to investigate, she slips on a kipper, bangs her head and falls unconscious.\n\nSneaking out to feed Tabby again, Mildred is confronted by Ethel, who snidely tells her that she untied the boat and let it drift out to sea. Mildred manages to get to the boat where she discovers not only Tabby, but the comatose Miss Hardbroom. Minutes after falling onto the boat, they bump into Cat's Head Rock. Mildred ties the boat onto an odd-looking chunk of rock and falls asleep.\n\nWhen she awakens, she finds that Maud and Enid have discovered them. Mildred tells them that there is something strange about the rock the boat is tied to. They pull at it and find that it is the mythical treasure chest. \nWhen they get back, Miss Hardbroom has revived and her injured head is bandaged. The contents of the treasure chest are used to repair Gloom Castle and Mildred is given Tabby back as a reward.\n\nMildred enjoys the rest of the holidays, feeling like \"the luckiest girl in the world instead of the worst witch in the school\".\n\n===''The Worst Witch Saves the Day''===\n''The Worst Witch Saves the Day'' ({{ISBN|978-0-14-138218-0}}) was published in 2005. It features Agatha Cackle disguised as new teacher Miss Granite.\n\n;Plot\nMildred Hubble is returning to Miss Cackle's Academy for Witches on the first day of her third year. After meeting up with her friends, Maud Spellbody and Enid Nightshade, Mildred sees that Maud's hair is curly (she borrowed a hairstyling brush from her aunt) and they also learn that they will have a new form-teacher this year other than Miss Hardbroom.\n\nThey see in assembly that their new form-teacher will be [[List of minor The Worst Witch characters#Agatha Cackle|Miss Granite]] (who was hired by Miss Cackle after [[Miss Gribble (The Worst Witch)|Miss Gribble]] failed to show discipline and against Miss Hardbroom's advice). Miss Granite is described as being very strange-looking and having \"a huge cloud of orange curls\n\" and also wearing \"enormous purple-tinted glasses and a short cape with a collar turned up so high that you couldn't see much of her face at all\". Miss Granite speaks in a very high-pitched, squeaky voice that shocks everyone including Ethel Hallow.\n\nMildred unravels her [[pigtails]] to try out Maud's styling brush. Maud and Enid find her with her hair loose and a chunk of her hair tangled up with the brush in a huge mess. Ethel comes in and volunteers to help. However, the \"help\" amounts to taking a pair of scissors and chopping off both the styling brush and the messy hair.\n\nEthel later offers to help Mildred again in her hair predicament. She formulates a [[potion]] that she claims will restore Mildred's hair to its rightful length. Mildred applies the potion that night and just when she is dropping off to sleep, her hair starts growing longer and longer by the minute, engulfing the whole school. Miss Hardbroom comes to investigate, states that Mildred is having \"a bad hair day\", manages to stop the hair growing and cuts it to its rightful length and vapourises the swathes of hair that had engulfed the whole school.\n\nIn a flying lesson, Ethel steals Tabby (who has been suffering a [[nervous breakdown]] as a result of the hair incident) and hides him on the roof in front of Miss Granite's study's window.\n\nThat night, when trying to recover Tabby, Mildred is locked in a cupboard by someone who seems to be Miss Cackle but is actually Miss Cackle's identical twin Agatha Cackle, who sneaked into the school disguised as Miss Granite. Agatha is trying to turn all the teachers and pupils into snails. Mildred manages to turn herself into an [[ant]], sneaks out of the cupboard and goes to Maud's room, where she tries unsuccessfully to wake her. Fortunately, she is able to attract Maud and Enid's attention by using ink-blots to write two notes \u2013 \"HELP NOT ANT\" attracting their attention to her and \"FORGOT SPEL\" clarifying her dilemma \u2013 and Maud and Enid turn her back into a human. Mildred tells them what is going on and, just as Agatha is about to turn Miss Cackle into a snail, Mildred turns her into a snail herself. They also bump into Miss Hardbroom, who had been away.\n\nMiss Hardbroom suggests that Miss Cackle poses as Agatha and invites Agatha's rebellious [[coven]] in, whereupon Mildred and the others will turn them all into snails, which happens. As Mildred, Maud, and Enid go back to bed they say they want Miss Hardbroom as form-teacher. She suddenly appears in front of them and is friendly for a brief moment before strictly telling them to get back to bed with no candles on.\n\n===''The Worst Witch to the Rescue''===\n''The Worst Witch to the Rescue'' ({{ISBN|978-0-14-138301-9}}) was published in 2007 and features Ethel Hallow's only friend, Drusilla Paddock, in a largely increased role since her brief cameo in ''The Worst Witch All at Sea''.\n\n;Plot\nEthel Hallow is returning to Miss Cackle's Academy for Witches for the Summer Term of her third year. Miss Hardbroom had previously set them a holiday project, but Ethel is doing exactly what Miss Hardbroom told them not to do: trying to think up a project in five minutes flat on the way back to school. Ethel spots Mildred Hubble crash-landed in a tree and manages to help her steady herself. Mildred explains to Ethel her project: a spell that can make animals talk, though it can only work on animals that fit into 25 centimetres and only lasts for two weeks. When helping Mildred out of the tree, Ethel knocks Mildred's luggage out of the tree. While Mildred tries to get Tabby, who had scampered up the tree, Ethel scoops up Mildred's project folder and art bag and her 30 [[coloured pencils]]. \nOn the way there, Mildred finds her friends Maud Spellbody and Enid Nightshade. When Mildred tells them about Ethel being nice for a change, Enid suggests she may have taken a \"niceness course\" during the holidays. Maud and Enid become suspicious when they catch Mildred talking to someone or something in her cat basket.\n\nThe girls find that their new form mistress is called [[Miss Mould]], who has a \"soft and kindly\" voice and \"short mousy hair parted in the middle and pulled into a [[ponytail]] at her neck\". She is a great relief from the horrifically strict Miss Hardbroom and the extremely weird Miss Granite whom they had had the previous term. Mildred sits next to [[Drusilla Paddock]], who swaps places with Ethel after Miss Mould tells Ethel her coils are too short. Minutes later, a [[maraca]]-like noise echoes through the classroom. Mildred finds that her coils have turned into five [[rattlesnakes]]. Miss Mould gets the whole class outside while Ethel stays inside and evaporates the rattlesnakes. Just then, Miss Hardbroom appears and Miss Mould explains what happened. Miss Hardbroom sends Mildred to her room and bans her from art lessons for the rest of the term. Mildred runs to her room where she figures out it must have been Ethel who turned her pot and coils into the snakes out of [[jealousy]].\nThe next day, in a lesson with Miss Hardbroom, the girls are presenting their projects to the class. Ethel goes first but her project is the same as Mildred's. Mildred shouts to Miss Hardbroom that Ethel had stolen her project. Miss Hardbroom opens Mildred's project folder but finds only lots of sheets of paper with smiley faces drawn on them in different colours. Miss Hardbroom \"transfers\" Mildred to her room.\n\nLater, Mildred finds that the creature inside her cat basket, a [[tortoise]] called Speedy whom she had used her spell on, can still speak. She renames him [[Einstein]] and Einstein tells her that he overheard her conversation with Ethel inside the tree. After Mildred runs to tell Maud and Enid the good news, Mildred accidentally leaves her bedroom door open and Einstein escapes. While plodding along the corridor he is discovered by Drusilla Paddock, who takes him to Ethel's room. While Ethel and Drusilla talk, it is revealed that Ethel did indeed take Mildred's project and had also \"tried out\" a snake spell on Mildred's pot and coils in art. Einstein overhears everything.\n\nWhen they are taking Einstein back to Mildred, Ethel eavesdrops on what Mildred is telling Maud and Enid. After discovering that Einstein can still speak and had overheard the conversation between Ethel and Mildred about the project, and that Einstein only has one more day before the spell wears off and he becomes mute forever, Ethel orders Drusilla to hide Einstein in the hollow [[pine tree]] outside the school gates. Einstein is put into a cardboard box that also contains a small green frog called Cyril, the animal whom Ethel had used in her demonstration. Cyril escapes and hops to Mildred's room. Cyril tells Mildred that Drusilla hid Einstein in the hollow pine tree outside the school gates and that he overheard several conversations about stealing projects and turning pots into snakes.\n\nAfter releasing Cyril into the woods, Mildred gets on her broomstick and, during a violent thunderstorm, finds and rescues Einstein. On landing she is confronted by Miss Hardbroom, who takes Mildred and Einstein inside and, after hearing part of the incidents from Mildred, sets an interview with Mildred and Ethel the next morning.\nThe next morning, Mildred goes to Miss Cackle's office where Einstein, resting in Miss Cackle's overflowing [[in-tray]], awakes and tells Miss Cackle and Miss Hardbroom that he overheard the conversation between Ethel and Mildred in the tree. He also says that he heard Ethel telling Drusilla that she had tried out a snake spell on Mildred's coils and had taken Mildred's project, copied it out in her own writing, and then thrown it in the kitchen bins. Ethel sifts through the rubbish and eventually finds Mildred's tea-stained project. Miss Hardbroom makes Ethel apologise to Mildred in assembly in front of the whole year as an alternative to being expelled for [[cheating]] as well as for her actions that put herself and Mildred in great danger.\n\nDuring a broomstick-flying lesson, Mildred reveals to Maud and Enid that Miss Cackle had provided Miss Mould's classroom with a proper [[kiln]] and craft room and she also got to keep Einstein as a pet. As the clock strikes midday, Mildred sprints into her room and hears Einstein speak for the last time in his raspy little voice (\"I'm glad I belong to you\"), before munching on his carrot and going silent forever.\n\n===''The Worst Witch and the Wishing Star''===\n''The Worst Witch and the Wishing Star'' (Scholastic UK, {{ISBN|978-0-141351995}}; another(?), {{ISBN|978-0-141383996}}) was released by Scholastic UK on 3 October 2013.<ref>[http://shop.scholastic.co.uk/products/93355 \"''The Worst Witch and the Wishing Star'' by Jill Murphy: For ages 7 to 9\"].

On that first night Maud spots a shooting star and Mildred makes a wish followed by Miss Hardbroom who does the same reluctantly. On the first lantern monitor shift Mildred is given a holdall containing safety objects in it. When she reaches the gates to finish the job Mildred spots a stray dog, who she names Star, she takes him to her bedroom as a secret pet, much to the disapproval of Tabby.\n\nDuring the weeks that follow Mildred, realising that Star is well behaved and calm on a broomstick, trains him to do various tricks with her. Maud and Enid, who realise Mildred isn't spending much time with them, soon discover about Star and are amazed by the tricks Mildred has taught him. Ethel, suspicious about Mildred hiding something in her holdall, reaches into it to discover Star was hidden in it and the both of them collapse\ninto the lanterns igniting the costumes Form Five have made for the talent competition.\n\nMiss Hardbroom, furious, sends Ethel and Mildred along with Star on a lead to Miss Cackle's office for what they had done then Maud and Enid explain about Star's tricks on the broom. Miss Cackle accepts the replacing talent and the next day the competition took place with the schools showing their talents. When it's Mildred's turn she amazes the judges with Star's tricks and wins the competition and the swimming pool. When the pupils go back to their school Miss Cackle allows Mildred to keep Star as her broomstick companion as a special privilege. Mildred later explains to Miss Hardbroom that she wished for Star on the shooting star at the beginning of term which doesn't annoy her as she wished on the star for them to win the competition. The story concludes with the teachers celebrating their victory and at the same time Miss Hardbroom's birthday.\n\n=== ''First Prize for the Worst Witch'' ===\n''First Prize for the Worst Witch'' ({{ISBN|9780141355092}}) was published in 2018.\n\nThe book deals with Mildred's graduation at the end of her fourth year. Its writing was delayed when Murphy underwent cancer treatment.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jan/25/jill-murphy-worst-witch-career-classic-children-author |title=Jill Murphy: 'I just wanted to have a book on the shelf' |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |first=Alison |last=Flood |date=25 January 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Setting==\nThe stories mainly take place within the walls of Miss Cackle's Academy for Witches, a girls-only boarding magic school that is described in the books as a stone castle on top of a mountain, surrounded by pine forest.\n\nThe school year is divided into two terms: the Winter term (September\u2013January) and the Summer term (March\u2013July), with a month's holiday between them. Students starts at Cackle's at the age of 12, and finish at the age of 17, for a total of five school years. The students arrive at the start of the term by flying broomsticks, except for the new first years, who walk through walker's gate as they can't fly yet. Halfway through the first term, the first years are each presented with a black kitten- Mildred receives a grey-and-black tabby cat as they apparently ran out of purely black cats- which they teach to ride the broomstick. The first book postulates that the cats weren't for any practical purpose except to keep tradition going, and in ''Wishing Star'', a group of elder witches note that there is no restriction on what animal a witch must have as her flight companion, with cats only being traditional as they are discreet and easy to care for, which leads to Mildred being permitted to fly with her dog, Star, after he shows greater broom aptitude than her cat Tabby. At the end of the first year, each pupil receives a copy of ''The Popular Book of Spells'', a three-inch thick volume bound in black leather. This was not really to be used, as they already had paperback editions for the classroom, but like the cats, it's another piece of tradition. At the end of the fifth and final year, students sit the exams for the W.H.C. (Witches' Higher Certificate), and most pupils were awarded with the certificate.\n\nThe first book says that the school winter uniform is composed of \"black gymslips, black stockings, black hob-nailed boots, grey shirts and black-and-grey ties.\" The first book also postulates that \"the only touches of colour [on the uniforms] were the sashes round their gymslips \u2013 a different colour for each house, although the houses are not named \u2013 and the school badge, which was a black cat sitting on a yellow moon.\" In the summer term, originally the girls wore grey-and-black checked dresses, but this was changed from ''Worst Witch All At Sea'' onwards to a simple black dress as Ms Hardbroom felt that the original design was too frivolous.\n\n==Characters==\n{{main|List of The Worst Witch characters}}\n\n===Mildred Hubble===\nMildred \"Millie\" Hubble is the protagonist of the series. She is a good-hearted, but bungling young witch-in-training, who never seems to get anything right. She is friends with Maud Spellbody and Enid Nightshade and has a strong rivalry with Ethel Hallow. It is Miss Hardbroom, her potions teacher, who calls her \"The Worst Witch\".\n\nJill Murphy's illustrations shows that she is tall, with long brown [[braid|plaits]]. Some illustrations shows that she frequently fails to tie her bootlaces and the colour ones that her uniform sash is red. According to the author, Mildred's appearance is based on her own appearance as a teenager. She remembers: \"Mildred is based on myself when I had plaits so long that I could sit on them!\"<ref name=Q&A>{{cite web|title=World Book Day Q&A with Jill Murphy|url=http://www.gransnet.com/forums/webchats/a1204459-World-Book-Day-Q-A-with-Jill-Murphy|website=Gransnet|accessdate=19 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Maud Spellbody===\nMaud Spellbody is Mildred's best friend. She is fiercely loyal to Mildred and assists her on most of her adventures, often against her better judgment. Maud is a decent and considerate person, but grows weary of Mildred's incessant clumsiness and often lectures her on how to improve herself. Ironically, Maud is not a perfect student, as she is also responsible for a laughing potion going wrong, as she along with Mildred had no idea how to make one. ''The Worst Witch All at Sea'' reveals her last name to be Spellbody, rather than \"Moonshine\", which is what the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] series dubbed her.\n\nThe author's illustrations shows that she is a short, plump girl with wide glasses who always wears her hair in bunches. The colour illustrations reveal that she is blonde and her uniform sash is yellow. According to the author, Maud is based on her best friend as a teenager, a girl called Elizabeth.<ref name=Q&A/>\n\n===Ethel Hallow===\nEthel Hallow is Mildred's acid-tongued rival. She does very well in class, comes from a prominent witch family, and gives the impression of being a model student. However, she is spoiled, snobbish and vindictive although able to [[turn on the charm]] and act sweet and innocent when the teachers are near, playing the role of a victim with Mildred as the bully. Up until ''The Worst Witch to the Rescue'', she is Miss Hardbroom's favourite student; however, in the same book, she is exposed as a cheat and a liar, and thus has to watch her step lest she incur her teacher's wrath.\n\nThe book illustrations shows that she is a tall, skinny and sharp-faced young girl. Her hair is mousy brown and her uniform sash is purple.\n\nIn the first book of the series, it is revealed without explanation that Ethel and Mildred were enemies prior to the story. Ethel takes pleasure in taunting Mildred about her inability to train her cat into riding a broomstick, and Mildred responds by turning her into a pig. From then on Mildred and Ethel resent each other, and Ethel vows to get Mildred expelled. So far she has been unsuccessful. In the first five books she appears to have no friends, although her young sister, Sybil, makes an appearance in ''A Bad Spell for the Worst Witch''. A friend of Ethel's, Drusilla, makes a brief appearance in ''The Worst Witch All at Sea'' and later plays a bigger part in ''The Worst Witch to the Rescue'', where she hides Mildred's tortoise up a tree. Ethel is Mildred's arch-enemy.\n\n===Enid Nightshade===\nAnother of Mildred's closest friends. She makes her debut in ''The Worst Witch Strikes Again'' after she is transferred to Miss Cackle's Academy and Mildred is assigned to look after her, to the irritation of Miss Hardbroom. At first Mildred thinks Enid will simply be a nuisance and a pain, but she turns out to be a wild practical joker. Her attempts to make Mildred like her only result in Mildred getting into trouble, for example, turning her cat into a monkey and enchanting a vaulting pole which catapults Mildred into the air and into Miss Hardbroom's study.\n\nEnid is tall, well-built and rather muscular for a girl. She has large limbs and fair hair, usually in one long plait. In the TV series she is small and waiflike with dark hair. She takes an instant liking to Mildred and hopes to become her friend, implying that she is not a judgmental girl. Overall she is friendly and kind-hearted, but sometimes oversteps the mark in her attempt to befriend and help people, and being nice. Aside from Mildred herself, Enid is considered the second worst witch in the Academy, as she too is hopeless when it comes to broomstick riding and magic.\n\n===Miss Hardbroom===\nMiss Hardbroom is the fearsome deputy headmistress of Miss Cackle's Academy and the clear [[power behind the throne]]. She is Mildred's form mistress in first form and through various combinations of events continues to be her form mistress throughout the series. Tall, bony and sour-faced, she strikes fear into the pupils' hearts. \"HB\", as the girls refer to her, seems to have a particular resentment of Mildred. Miss Hardbroom frequently praises and rewards Ethel Hallow, and frequently rebukes Mildred in front of the other students. It is Miss Hardbroom who gives Mildred the title of \"the worst witch in the school\".\n\nIn the later books Miss Hardbroom's humanity comes through on occasion, in incidents such as her accident in ''The Worst Witch All at Sea'', the restoring of Mildred's hair to its rightful length in ''The Worst Witch Saves the Day'', and her admitting of her error of judgment at the end of ''The Worst Witch to the Rescue''.\n\nMiss Hardbroom usually has her hair tied up in a tight bun which makes her face look really long.\nMiss Hardbroom is very strict on all of the girls except Ethel Hallow, the teachers' pet.\n\n===Miss Cackle===\nAmelia Cackle (Ada Cackle in the [[The Worst Witch (2017 TV series)|2017 TV series]]) is the kind-hearted headmistress of the Academy. Plump and pleasant, Miss Cackle is more lenient towards Mildred when she is in trouble, and rather than intimidate the girl as Miss Hardbroom does, Miss Cackle gives long, sorrowful lectures which causes Mildred to feel guilty for the trouble she is in. Her birthday is celebrated at her beloved Academy, and her students believe it to be the most boring event of the year. Despite her kind heart, Miss Cackle can be intimidating when she wants to, and has occasionally broken into fits of rage at Mildred, most notably both when Mildred humiliated the reputation of the Academy by ruining a broomstick display to honour the Wizards' Council (Ethel had cursed Mildred to ensure she would make a fool of herself), and after she incorrectly believed Mildred was cheating at the school sport's day, after Enid cast an improper spell upon Mildred to make sure she won the pole-vaulting competition. However, these moments of anger are few and short-lived.\n\nMiss Cackle has an evil twin sister named Agatha Cackle, who is bitterly jealous of her position of authority at the Academy. In the first of the series, Agatha and her [[coven]] of rebellious witches plotted to overthrow Miss Cackle and turn her, the staff, and students into frogs as they slept. Mildred caught them as they brewed their invisibility potion, by turning them into snails and taking them to the school to show Miss Cackle. Ashamed that her own sister would break the Witches' Code, she ordered Agatha to accept defeat and live the code like all decent witches. Agatha reluctantly co-operated. She tries to take over again at the end of series 1, by pretending to be Miss Cackle and dragging Mildred out of the classroom by her ear.\n\n===Drusilla Paddock===\nThe \"best friend\" of Ethel Hallow, with whom she is often paired up. Drusilla appears only briefly in ''The Worst Witch All at Sea'', but her role in the TV series and in the later books increases greatly. Drusilla is a horrible, vindictive bully, but lacks the acid-tongued spite of Ethel, and seems to be in great awe of her. Their \"friendship\" seems to be more of an alliance or a form of servitude: Ethel and Drusilla are not true friends, they have stuck beside each other because nobody else can bear to be around them. Drusilla seems to have no will of her own. Drusilla does everything Ethel orders her to, and in one book (''The Worst Witch to the Rescue'') she steals Mildred's beloved pet [[tortoise]] and hides it in a tree. In the TV series, she and Ethel briefly end their friendship when Drusilla sides with Mildred and her friends. They make up at the end of the episode though.\n\n==Adaptations==\n\n===Television film===\n{{main|The Worst Witch (film)}}\n\nIn 1986, the first book in the series was converted to a made-for-television film on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] starring [[Fairuza Balk]], [[Tim Curry]], [[Diana Rigg]], and [[Charlotte Rae]]. Though a British film, it also aired in the USA on [[HBO]]. The film followed the plot of the first book of the series, portraying the incidents of Mildred turning herself invisible and turning Ethel into a pig, Miss Cackle's evil twin sister Agatha plotting to take over the school, and the Grand Wizard viewing the Halloween Broomstick formation (sabotaged by Ethel's faulty broom she lent to Mildred). It was shot at [[St. Michael's College, Tenbury|St. Michael's College]] in [[Tenbury Wells]]. This holiday special later aired on the [[Disney Channel]] every year for [[Halloween]] until the late 1990s. Its opening song, \"Growing Up Isn't Easy\", was sung by [[Bonnie Langford]]; its music was composed by [[Charles Strouse]] and its lyrics were written by [[Don Black (lyricist)|Don Black]]. Their other musical number was \"Anything Can Happen on Halloween\", sung by [[Tim Curry]]. [[Denis King]] composed its incidental music score. He also wrote the song \"My Little School\".\n\n===Television series (1998-2001)===\n''[[The Worst Witch (1998 TV series)|The Worst Witch]]'', a TV series based on the books, starring [[Georgina Sherrington]] and [[Felicity Jones]] as Mildred Hubble and Ethel Hallow respectively, was broadcast from 1998 to 2001. It was shot in [[Montreal]], London and [[Cardiff]]. The series is mostly shot in studio in London, with some episodes filmed in Montreal, [[Quebec]], Canada. The exteriors of Cackle's Academy used [[Castell Coch]], a castle located near Cardiff. The courtyard was filmed at [[Loseley Park]], near [[Guildford]]. Inside the school (Great Hall, classrooms etc.) was filmed at [[Twickenham Studios]].\n\n====Spin-offs====\nWhen it was no longer realistic that Mildred would still be at school, the series relocated her to a magical university in [[Cambridge]] and was retitled ''[[Weirdsister College]]: The Further Adventures of the Worst Witch,'' and saw the return of Felicity Jones as a reinvented Ethel Hallow.\n\nIn 2004, a new series based on the 1998 series was made, entitled ''[[The New Worst Witch]]''. It centred on the adventures of Mildred's equally bungling cousin, Henrietta \"Hettie\" Hubble, played by [[Alice Connor]], also set at Cackle's Academy.\n\n===Television series (2017-present)===\nA new version of ''[[The Worst Witch (2017 TV series)|The Worst Witch]]'' TV series began in 2017 airing on [[CBBC]], this one starring [[Bella Ramsey]] as Mildred Hubble, [[Claire Higgins]] as Miss Cackle, and [[Raquel Cassidy]] as Miss Hardbroom.\n\n===Stage Adaptation (2018-2019)===\nA musical stage production called ''Worst Witch Live'' was shown at the [[Royal & Derngate]] Theatre in Northampton from 27 November to 30 December 2018.  In February 2019, the show began to tour the UK across 16 different venues. In April 2019 Kenny Wax Family Entertainment announced that ''Worst Witch Live'' will be showing at the [[Vaudeville Theatre]] in the West End from 24 July to 8 September 2019. This version is presented is a publicity play written by Mildred and acted out by the students and staff playing themselves, initially recreating Mildred's first year at school, although the second half takes on a metafictional angle as Agatha Cackle 'infiltrates' the play and attempts to stage a coup of the magical government.\n\n''Worst Witch Live'' stars [https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3930361/?ref_=nv_sr_1?ref_=nv_sr_1 Danielle Bird] as Mildred Hubble, [[imdbname:1118833|Polly Lister]] as Miss Cackle/Agatha, [https://www.mandy.com/actor/profile/rachel-heaton Rachel Heaton] as Miss Hardbroom and [https://www.actorum.com/actor/rosie-abraham/ Rosie Abraham] as Ethel Hallow.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Children's literature|Fantasy}}\n* [[Boarding schools in fiction]]\n* [[School story]]\n* [[Little Witch Academia]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist |25em |refs=\n<ref name=images>\n{{cite web |title=Jill Murphy: Biography |work=Images of Delight: Original artwork from children's book illustrators |url=http://www.imagesofdelight.com/gallery14.htm |accessdate=17 April 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929190352/http://www.imagesofdelight.com/client.asp?id=56 |archivedate=29 September 2007}} <!--update 2013-10-24--></ref>\n<ref name=\"new_series_2017_prod\">\n{{cite web|title=Netflix Sets Tween Series \u2018Worst Witch,\u2019 \u2018Horse Mystery Project\u2019 For 2017|url=https://variety.com/2016/digital/news/netflix-tween-series-worst-witch-horse-mystery-project-1201849203|website=Variety|accessdate=9 July 2018}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{worldcat id|fast-962667|Mildred Hubble}}\n\n{{The Worst Witch}}\n\n<!--Mildred Hubbell?-->\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Worst Witch}}\n[[Category:Children's fantasy novels]]\n[[Category:British children's novels]]\n[[Category:Series of children's books]]\n[[Category:Contemporary fantasy novels]]\n[[Category:The Worst Witch|*]]\n[[Category:Witchcraft in written fiction]]\n[[Category:Child characters in television]]\n[[Category:Child characters in literature]] <!--Mildred Hubbell?-->\n[[Category:Characters in children's literature]]\n[[Category:Novels set in schools]]\n[[Category:British novels adapted into films]]\n[[Category:1974 children's books]]\n[[Category:Allison and Busby books]]\n", "name_user": "Proscribe", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eAdaptations:minor edit, en-dashes", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Worst_Witch"}

The squadron was disestablished on 22 May 2012.\n\n=Squadron History=\n\n==1950s==\n\n===Roots===\n[[File:Consolidated PB4Y-2 Naval Aviation Museum.jpg|left|thumb|PB4Y-2 BuNo 66261 (marked as BuNo 66304) in the collection of the [[National Naval Aviation Museum]] at [[Naval Air Station Pensacola|NAS Pensacola]], [[Florida]].]]\nFleet Air Reconnaissance in the European Theater had been conducted since the start of the Cold War by detachments within patrol squadrons (VP) flying modified [[PB4Y-2 Privateer|PB4Y-2 Privateers]] from [[Naval Air Station Port Lyautey|NAS Port Lyautey]] and conducting missions in the Baltic, Black, Mediterranean, and North Seas. These missions occasionally provoked reactions, sometimes hostile, from behind the Iron Curtain. On April 8, 1950, Soviet [[Lavochkin La-11]] fighters shot down a Lyautey-based PB4Y-2 Privateer (BUNO 59645) over the Baltic Sea, off the coast of Liep\u0101ja, Latvia with the loss of all ten aircrew<ref name=\"StaHypo1\">{{Cite web|title = History Of VQ-2. Part 1|url = https://stationhypo.com/2018/09/03/history-of-vq-2-part-1-of-5/#more-9954|website = stationhypo.com|accessdate = 2018-09-28}}</ref><ref name=\"VQH\" />.\n\nShortly after the start of the Korean War in 1950, a dedicated unit, Naval Air Activities (NAA), Port Lyautey Patrol Unit (NPU) was established with three PB4Y-2 aircraft and personnel transferred from VP-26. As this unit demonstrated its value to the Navy, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) and the Bureau of Aeronautics (BuAer) came to realize that a dedicated aircraft was a necessity. \n\nBy 1952, the VP community had not had much success with the [[Martin P4M Mercator|P-4M-1 Mercator]]  that it had deployed to Morocco due to maintenance issues arising from its nineteen airframe total production run. The rest of the VP community found easier maintenance with the Lockheed P2V Neptunes deployed in theater because that airframe had been adopted as the VP standard asset. The maritime patrol commanders removed them from frontline service at Lyautey in favor of the Neptune.  Washington subsequently decided to reconfigure all but one P4M-1 as P4M-1Qs and permanently assign them to the Naval Communications Units established at NPU and its sister unit at Sangley Point, Philippines. Having lost an aircraft and lives to hostile Soviet action, the aircrew appreciated the added takeoff and combat speed of the two [[Allison J33-A-10A]] turbojet engines mounted in the aft of the [[Pratt & Whitney R-4360-20A Wasp Major]] radial's nacelles<ref name=\"East\">East, Don C.</ref>. \n\nIn 1953, with the conversion and deployment of the P4M-1Q, NPU needed  an administrative identity as part of the Naval Air Force Atlantic (AIRLANT) structure and Airborne Early Warning Squadron TWO (VW-2) at NAS Patuxent River became the command into which NPU was folded as VW-2 DET A. Since VW-2 Det A's mission began to diverge greatly from the parent unit's VW mission, the Navy decided to establish dedicated squadrons for the Fleet Air Reconnaissance mission. One was to be formed from VW-2 Det A and the other would be formed from its siter unit at Sangley, VW-1 Det A. By mid-1954, four P4M-1Qs and one [[Lockheed P-2 Neptune|Lockheed P2V-2 Neptune]] were at Lyautey. The P2V-2, stripped of ASW equipment, served as a trainer and logistics aircraft.\n\n===Establishment===\n\nVQ-2 was commissioned as [[Electronic countermeasure|Electronic Countermeasures]] Squadron TWO (ECMRON TWO) on September 1, 1955 to provide the United States with an improved defense posture. The squadron took over VW-2 DET A's spcaes and hangar at NAS Port Lyautey.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|title = VQ-2 Fleet Air  Reconnaissance Squadron TWO|url = http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/agency/navy/vq-2.htm|website = www.globalsecurity.org|accessdate = 2015-11-06}}</ref> Through the 1950s, VQ-2 would continue to fly missions throughout the European Theater operating from Cyprus, Germany, Libya, Turkey, and the United Kingdom. At commissioning, Commander Morris L. Kalin led a total complement of 24 officers and 78 enlisted men<ref name=\"East\" />.\n\n[[File:Martin P4M Mercator VQ-2 06.09.56.jpg|thumb|left|P4M-1Q Mercator of VQ-2 electronics reconnaissance squadron in September 1956 - note extra radar 'bulges' on this variant.]]\n[[File:P2V-5 NAS Jacksonville 1952.jpg|thumb|left|P2V-5 with nose turret in 1952. The Lyautey P2V-5Fs had additional turbojets mounted on nacelles where the rockets are in this photo.]]\nThe squadron continued using the six P4M-1Qs as mission aircraft. In addition, they obtained three Lockheed P2V-5Fs. The P2V-5Fs were reconfigured onsite from the standard maritime reconnaissance to similar electronic suites as the P-4Ms. Of note, the P2v-5Fs had the same dash speed capability as the P4Ms from two [[Westinghouse J34]]-WE-34 turbojets mounted on their own nacelles outboard the [[Wright R-3350 Duplex-Cyclone|Wright R-3350-32W Cyclone Turbo-compound]] radials. The squadron used the P2V-3 for pilot training and logistics, since it was not configured for electronic reconnaissance (this became a standard squadron practice when possible; using a \"bare bones airframe of one of its models for training and logistics)<ref name=\"East\" />. The four Neptunes would serve alongside the Mercators until 1960.\n\nTo give the squadron a ship-based capability allowing its assets to travel with the battle group, in September 1956, a new and faster [[Carrier-based aircraft|carrier-capable]] [[Douglas A-3 Skywarrior|A3D-1Q Skywarrior]] was delivered to the squadron. The A3D-1Q was a reconfigured A3D-1 with the bombay closed and an electronic reconnaissance suite installed similar to those of the P4M-1Q and P2V-5F<ref name=\"Francillon\">Francillon</ref><ref name=\"Heinemann\">Heinemann</ref>. The Whale was carrier-capable and had a crew of four<ref name= \"Winchester\">Winchester 2006, p. 75.</ref>. The squadron also received an A3D-1 which it use like the P2V-3<ref name=\"East\" />. With the high tempo of operations and depot-level maintenance for the three models back in the continental United States (CONUS), it is unsurprising that on 1 June 1957, the command had three P4M-1Q,, two A3D-1Q, two P2V-5F, one A3D-1, and one P2V-3 reported in its table of organization (TOE)<ref name=\"East\" />.\n\nThe [[1958 Lebanon crisis|Lebanon Crisis in 1958]] on 15 July 1958, saw a p4M-1Q and aircrew shift south from Incirlik to fly out of Beirut while the US Marines and US Army were deployed there at the behest of [[Camille Chamoun]], the President. VQ-2 operated out of [[Beirut Airport]] through the remainder of the summer and into the fall, departing with the withdrawal of US forces after stabilization in October 1958.\n\n===Homeport Change===\n\nAs a result of the Pact of Madrid, signed on 23 September 1953 by [[Francoist Spain|Spain]] and the [[United States]], the US pledged  to furnish [[foreign aid|economic]] and [[military aid]] to Spain. The United States, in turn, was to be permitted to construct and to utilize air and naval bases on Spanish territory ([[Naval Station Rota]], [[Mor\u00f3n Air Base]], [[Torrej\u00f3n Air Base]], and [[Zaragoza Air Base]]). By 1959, the base at Rota and its airfield had been completed to satisfy the US Navy's aviation needs. Due to its newer facilities, the Navy decided to move VQ-2 to Rota.\n\nThe relocation of the squadron to Rota began in late 1958 into the first days of 1959. The shift of the squadron CO, XO, and department heads (DHs) was completed by 14 January 1959, but it would take another year to transfer all command assets to Rota<ref name=\"East\" />. All assets at Lyautey had to be surveyed, packed up, and moved. \n\nDuring this evolution, five seven-seat A3D-2Q aircraft arrived to replace the four-seat A3D-1Qs. These new aircraft had the bulkhead between the  cockpit and the bomb bay removed, the bomb bay sealed, and three more seats and equipment added in the former bay.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\"East\" />. This unarmed version (the tail gun had been removed<ref name=\"Francillon\" />) brought an increase in capability to the community.\n\n===Aircraft/Aircrew Losses and Mishaps===\n\nOver the course of the decade, VQ-2 suffered the eleven aircrew fatalities and three aircraft in three mishaps:\n# On 6 January 1958, at the end of a ferry flight from Port Lyautey, via Lajes, Azores and Bermuda to [[NAS Norfolk]], Virginia, P4M-1Q (BUNO 124373)<ref name='VPNavy'>{{Cite web|title = VQ-2 Mishaps|url =https://www.vpnavy.com/vq2_mishap.html|website = www.vpnavy.com|accessdate = 2020-03-08}}</ref> lost an engine on approach. The aircraft crashed at at 22 St. and E. Ocean Ave., Norfolk, killing four crew and injuring three civilians.<ref name=\"Anderson\">\"Four Missing In Air Crash\", ''The Anderson Independent'', 7 January 1958</ref> Two aircrew were injured and one was uninjured.\n# On 16 October 1958, returning to Incirlik, A3D-1Q (BUNO 130356)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\">{{Cite web|title = All A-3 Skywarriors Produced by Douglas|url =https://www.a3skywarrior.com/ready-room/a-3-dispositions/a-3-production.html|website = www.a3skywarrior.com|accessdate = 2020-03-08}}</ref> crashed near the airfield. All four aircrew aboard were killed.\n\n==1960s==\n\nWhile keeping the alphanumeric designation VQ-2, EMCRON TWO was renamed Fleet Air Reconnaissance Squadron TWO (FAIRECONRON TWO) on January 1, 1960. Its sister squadron, [[VQ-1]] was similarly renamed. On 14 January 1960, with all equipment and personnel out of Lyautey, VQ-2 officially transferred to Naval Station. \n\nThe Navy had recognized that the maintenance costs of the aging, worn P4M-1Q and P2V-5F airframes were increasingly more expensive to maintain, and these planes needed replacement. Washington opted for a larger, more capable aircraft, the [[EC-121 Warning Star|Lockheed WV-2Q Warning Star]]. The \"Willie Victors,\" unarmed like the A3D-2Qs<ref name=\":0\" />, could carry a crew of twenty-six. On 26 February 1960, the first two WV-2Q arrived. By the end of the first quarter in 1960, 31 March, VQ-2'aircraft inventory were five A3D-2Q, three P2V-5F, two P4M-1Q, and two WV-2Q. The P2V-5F and P4M-1Q aircraft were soon to be phased out as all hands quickly adapted to the A3D-2Q and WV-2Q airframes. Meanwhile, the\u00b7squadron continued its business of airborne electronic reconnaissance. By the summer of 1960, the Mercators and Neptunes were gone.\n\nOn 18 September 1962, the Department of Defense (DoD) initiated its Tri-Service Aircraft Designation System which replaced the 1922 USN Aircraft Designation System. The new unified system for designating all US military aircraft was a ''Type/Model/Series'' (T/M/S).<ref name=\"TMS\">{{cite web|url=http://www.designation-systems.info/usmilav/aircraft.html|title=Current Designations of U.S. Military Aircraft|website = www.designation-systems.info|accessdate = 2020-03-08}}</ref>. With this change, the A3D-2Q became the EA-3B and the WV-2Q became the EC-121M<ref name=\":0\" />.\n\n[[File:Lockheed EC-121M VQ-2.jpg|left|thumb|A U.S. Navy Lockheed EC-121M Warning Star of VQ-2.]]\n\n===In Theater Operations===\n\nIn response to the [[Berlin Crisis of 1961]], VQ-2 flew missions in West Germany along the border with Czechoslovakia and East Germany as well as their routine missions into the Baltic. By now these were being carried out primarily by the WV-2Qs with A3D-2Qs filling in as needed<ref name=\":0\" />. Tensions continued to increase as the Kennedy administration and its NATO allies responded to Soviet moves in Europe.\n\nFollowing the Cuban Missile Crisis was [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 186|Cyprus Crisis in 1964]] saw an increase in international tensions in the Eastern Mediterranean. This led to an increase in EC-121M and EA-3B presence in the Levant<ref name=\"East\"/>. Afterwards, a series of eastern Mediterranean crises provided ample opportunities for VQ-2 to perform timely reconnaissance<ref name=\"StaHypo\" />. A major factor in the more direct tactical reconnaissance shipboard role was the rapidly growing and modernizing Soviet Navy that established a continuous presence in the Mediterranean, concurrent with the Cyprus Crisis. In response to these crises, VQ-2 started operating EA-3B detachments aboard a Mediterranean-based carriers like her sister squadron, VQ-1 did in the Pacific. In January of 1965, the first planes went aboard the [[USS Saratoga (CV-60)|USS Saratoga (CVA-60)]]. Detachments aboardupport to the Mediterranean deployed carriers.\n\nWhile operating in Vietnam and the Philippines, the political tensions in the Middle East and North Africa were building. In June of 1967, armed conflict erupted into the [[Six-Day War]] where Israel defeated its enemies. The loss of the [[USS Liberty]] during the war at the hands of the IDF reaffirmed the relative safety of using aircraft for fleet reconnaissance<ref name=\"East\" />. This incident kept the high tempo of operations in the Eastern Mediterranean despite a cessation of strife in Cyprus. The coup in Libya in 1969 combined with the ever increasing presence of the Soviet Navy to counter the presence of the NATO navies in the Mediterranean kept the command operating at a high tempo.\n\nAs the decade came to a close, VQ-2 found itself operating all over Europe from various NATO bases, from US Sixth Fleet carriers, as well as in Southeast Asia.\n\n===Cuban Missile Crisis===\n\nIn October 1962 the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] developed. Since the Navy had no comparable reconnaissance assets available in CONUS<ref name=\"StaHypo\" />, VQ-2 deployed a number of EA-3B and an EC-121M aircraft to [[NAS Key West]] to provide those services around Cuba. After this major superpower crisis was defused, the assets returned to Spain. The squadron's rapidity and flexibility demonstrated in Florida<ref name=\"VQH\" /> kept it very busy when it returned to Europe where it resumed missions in the Mediterranean, Baltic, and central Europe. \n===Vietnam===\n\nDuring the Vietnam War, the squadron deployed detachments to augment  VQ-1's support of US Navy operations in and around Vietnam under CINCPACFLT operational control. In late summer 1965, VQ-2 established DET ALFA at [[NAS Cubi Point]], Philippines. Sorties were routinely flown by EA-3Bs and EC-121Ms into the theater to support US Navy combat operations in Vietnam. After it sister squadron, [[VQ-1]], established its DET BRAVO flying from [[Da Nang]] Air Base in South Vietnam in 1966, VQ-2 EA-3Bs joined them operating almost exclusively from there as VQ-2 DET BRAVO<ref name=\"East\" />.

These missions occasionally provoked reactions, sometimes hostile, from behind the Iron Curtain. On April 8, 1950, Soviet [[Lavochkin La-11]] fighters shot down a Lyautey-based PB4Y-2 Privateer (BUNO 59645) over the Baltic Sea, off the coast of Liep\u0101ja, Latvia with the loss of all ten aircrew<ref name=\"StaHypo1\">{{Cite web|title = History Of VQ-2.

As this unit demonstrated its value to the Navy, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) and the Bureau of Aeronautics (BuAer) came to realize that a dedicated aircraft was a necessity. \n\nBy 1952, the VP community had not had much success with the [[Martin P4M Mercator|P-4M-1 Mercator]]  that it had deployed to Morocco due to maintenance issues arising from its nineteen airframe total production run. The rest of the VP community found easier maintenance with the Lockheed P2V Neptunes deployed in theater because that airframe had been adopted as the VP standard asset. The maritime patrol commanders removed them from frontline service at Lyautey in favor of the Neptune.  Washington subsequently decided to reconfigure all but one P4M-1 as P4M-1Qs and permanently assign them to the Naval Communications Units established at NPU and its sister unit at Sangley Point, Philippines. Having lost an aircraft and lives to hostile Soviet action, the aircrew appreciated the added takeoff and combat speed of the two [[Allison J33-A-10A]] turbojet engines mounted in the aft of the [[Pratt & Whitney R-4360-20A Wasp Major]] radial's nacelles<ref name=\"East\">East, Don C.</ref>. \n\nIn 1953, with the conversion and deployment of the P4M-1Q, NPU needed  an administrative identity as part of the Naval Air Force Atlantic (AIRLANT) structure and Airborne Early Warning Squadron TWO (VW-2) at NAS Patuxent River became the command into which NPU was folded as VW-2 DET A. Since VW-2 Det A's mission began to diverge greatly from the parent unit's VW mission, the Navy decided to establish dedicated squadrons for the Fleet Air Reconnaissance mission. One was to be formed from VW-2 Det A and the other would be formed from its siter unit at Sangley, VW-1 Det A. By mid-1954, four P4M-1Qs and one Lockheed  P2V-2 (XD5).  P2V-2 had been stripped of ASW equipment, except for essential radio navigation and was used for navigation training and a shuttle for shopping trips to Gibraltar.\n\n===Establishment===\n\nVQ-2 was commissioned as [[Electronic countermeasure|Electronic Countermeasures]] Squadron TWO (ECMRON TWO) on September 1, 1955 to provide the United States with an improved defense posture. The squadron took over VW-2 DET A's spcaes and hangar at NAS Port Lyautey.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|title = VQ-2 Fleet Air  Reconnaissance Squadron TWO|url = http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/agency/navy/vq-2.htm|website = www.globalsecurity.org|accessdate = 2015-11-06}}</ref> Through the 1950s, VQ-2 would continue to fly missions throughout the European Theater operating from Cyprus, Germany, Libya, Turkey, and the United Kingdom. At commissioning, Commander Morris L. Kalin led a total complement of 24 officers and 78 enlisted men<ref name=\"East\" />.\n\n[[File:Martin P4M Mercator VQ-2 06.09.56.jpg|thumb|left|P4M-1Q Mercator of VQ-2 electronics reconnaissance squadron in September 1956 - note extra radar 'bulges' on this variant.]]\n[[File:P2V-5 NAS Jacksonville 1952.jpg|thumb|left|P2V-5 with nose turret in 1952. The Lyautey P2V-5Fs had additional turbojets mounted on nacelles where the rockets are in this photo.]]\nThe squadron continued using the six P4M-1Qs as mission aircraft. In addition, they obtained three Lockheed P2V-5Fs. The P2V-5Fs were reconfigured onsite from the standard maritime reconnaissance to similar electronic suites as the P-4Ms. Of note, the P2v-5Fs had the same dash speed capability as the P4Ms from two [[Westinghouse J34]]-WE-34 turbojets mounted on their own nacelles outboard the [[Wright R-3350 Duplex-Cyclone|Wright R-3350-32W Cyclone Turbo-compound]] radials. The squadron used the P2V-3 for pilot training and logistics, since it was not configured for electronic reconnaissance (this became a standard squadron practice when possible; using a \"bare bones airframe of one of its models for training and logistics)<ref name=\"East\" />. The four Neptunes would serve alongside the Mercators until 1960.\n\nTo give the squadron a ship-based capability allowing its assets to travel with the battle group, in September 1956, a new and faster [[Carrier-based aircraft|carrier-capable]] [[Douglas A-3 Skywarrior|A3D-1Q Skywarrior]] was delivered to the squadron. The A3D-1Q was a reconfigured A3D-1 with the bombay closed and an electronic reconnaissance suite installed similar to those of the P4M-1Q and P2V-5F<ref name=\"Francillon\">Francillon</ref><ref name=\"Heinemann\">Heinemann</ref>. The Whale was carrier-capable and had a crew of four<ref name= \"Winchester\">Winchester 2006, p. 75.</ref>. The squadron also received an A3D-1 which it use like the P2V-3<ref name=\"East\" />. With the high tempo of operations and depot-level maintenance for the three models back in the continental United States (CONUS), it is unsurprising that on 1 June 1957, the command had three P4M-1Q,, two A3D-1Q, two P2V-5F, one A3D-1, and one P2V-3 reported in its table of organization (TOE)<ref name=\"East\" />.\n\nThe [[1958 Lebanon crisis|Lebanon Crisis in 1958]] on 15 July 1958, saw a p4M-1Q and aircrew shift south from Incirlik to fly out of Beirut while the US Marines and US Army were deployed there at the behest of [[Camille Chamoun]], the President. VQ-2 operated out of [[Beirut Airport]] through the remainder of the summer and into the fall, departing with the withdrawal of US forces after stabilization in October 1958.\n\n===Homeport Change===\n\nAs a result of the Pact of Madrid, signed on 23 September 1953 by [[Francoist Spain|Spain]] and the [[United States]], the US pledged  to furnish [[foreign aid|economic]] and [[military aid]] to Spain. The United States, in turn, was to be permitted to construct and to utilize air and naval bases on Spanish territory ([[Naval Station Rota]], [[Mor\u00f3n Air Base]], [[Torrej\u00f3n Air Base]], and [[Zaragoza Air Base]]). By 1959, the base at Rota and its airfield had been completed to satisfy the US Navy's aviation needs. Due to its newer facilities, the Navy decided to move VQ-2 to Rota.\n\nThe relocation of the squadron to Rota began in late 1958 into the first days of 1959. The shift of the squadron CO, XO, and department heads (DHs) was completed by 14 January 1959, but it would take another year to transfer all command assets to Rota<ref name=\"East\" />. All assets at Lyautey had to be surveyed, packed up, and moved. \n\nDuring this evolution, five seven-seat A3D-2Q aircraft arrived to replace the four-seat A3D-1Qs. These new aircraft had the bulkhead between the  cockpit and the bomb bay removed, the bomb bay sealed, and three more seats and equipment added in the former bay.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\"East\" />. This unarmed version (the tail gun had been removed<ref name=\"Francillon\" />) brought an increase in capability to the community.\n\n===Aircraft/Aircrew Losses and Mishaps===\n\nOver the course of the decade, VQ-2 suffered the eleven aircrew fatalities and three aircraft in three mishaps:\n# On 6 January 1958, at the end of a ferry flight from Port Lyautey, via Lajes, Azores and Bermuda to [[NAS Norfolk]], Virginia, P4M-1Q (BUNO 124373)<ref name='VPNavy'>{{Cite web|title = VQ-2 Mishaps|url =https://www.vpnavy.com/vq2_mishap.html|website = www.vpnavy.com|accessdate = 2020-03-08}}</ref> lost an engine on approach.

All four aircrew aboard were killed.\n\n==1960s==\n\nWhile keeping the alphanumeric designation VQ-2, EMCRON TWO was renamed Fleet Air Reconnaissance Squadron TWO (FAIRECONRON TWO) on January 1, 1960. Its sister squadron, [[VQ-1]] was similarly renamed. On 14 January 1960, with all equipment and personnel out of Lyautey, VQ-2 officially transferred to Naval Station. \n\nThe Navy had recognized that the maintenance costs of the aging, worn P4M-1Q and P2V-5F airframes were increasingly more expensive to maintain, and these planes needed replacement. Washington opted for a larger, more capable aircraft, the [[EC-121 Warning Star|Lockheed WV-2Q Warning Star]]. The \"Willie Victors,\" unarmed like the A3D-2Qs<ref name=\":0\" />, could carry a crew of twenty-six. On 26 February 1960, the first two WV-2Q arrived. By the end of the first quarter in 1960, 31 March, VQ-2'aircraft inventory were five A3D-2Q, three P2V-5F, two P4M-1Q, and two WV-2Q. The P2V-5F and P4M-1Q aircraft were soon to be phased out as all hands quickly adapted to the A3D-2Q and WV-2Q airframes. Meanwhile, the\u00b7squadron continued its business of airborne electronic reconnaissance. By the summer of 1960, the Mercators and Neptunes were gone.\n\nOn 18 September 1962, the Department of Defense (DoD) initiated its Tri-Service Aircraft Designation System which replaced the 1922 USN Aircraft Designation System. The new unified system for designating all US military aircraft was a ''Type/Model/Series'' (T/M/S).<ref name=\"TMS\">{{cite web|url=http://www.designation-systems.info/usmilav/aircraft.html|title=Current Designations of U.S. Military Aircraft|website = www.designation-systems.info|accessdate = 2020-03-08}}</ref>. With this change, the A3D-2Q became the EA-3B and the WV-2Q became the EC-121M<ref name=\":0\" />.\n\n[[File:Lockheed EC-121M VQ-2.jpg|left|thumb|A U.S. Navy Lockheed EC-121M Warning Star of VQ-2.]]\n\n===In Theater Operations===\n\nIn response to the [[Berlin Crisis of 1961]], VQ-2 flew missions in West Germany along the border with Czechoslovakia and East Germany as well as their routine missions into the Baltic. By now these were being carried out primarily by the WV-2Qs with A3D-2Qs filling in as needed<ref name=\":0\" />. Tensions continued to increase as the Kennedy administration and its NATO allies responded to Soviet moves in Europe.\n\nFollowing the Cuban Missile Crisis was [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 186|Cyprus Crisis in 1964]] saw an increase in international tensions in the Eastern Mediterranean. This led to an increase in EC-121M and EA-3B presence in the Levant<ref name=\"East\"/>. Afterwards, a series of eastern Mediterranean crises provided ample opportunities for VQ-2 to perform timely reconnaissance<ref name=\"StaHypo\" />. A major factor in the more direct tactical reconnaissance shipboard role was the rapidly growing and modernizing Soviet Navy that established a continuous presence in the Mediterranean, concurrent with the Cyprus Crisis. In response to these crises, VQ-2 started operating EA-3B detachments aboard a Mediterranean-based carriers like her sister squadron, VQ-1 did in the Pacific. In January of 1965, the first planes went aboard the [[USS Saratoga (CV-60)|USS Saratoga (CVA-60)]]. Detachments aboardupport to the Mediterranean deployed carriers.\n\nWhile operating in Vietnam and the Philippines, the political tensions in the Middle East and North Africa were building. In June of 1967, armed conflict erupted into the [[Six-Day War]] where Israel defeated its enemies. The loss of the [[USS Liberty]] during the war at the hands of the IDF reaffirmed the relative safety of using aircraft for fleet reconnaissance<ref name=\"East\" />. This incident kept the high tempo of operations in the Eastern Mediterranean despite a cessation of strife in Cyprus. The coup in Libya in 1969 combined with the ever increasing presence of the Soviet Navy to counter the presence of the NATO navies in the Mediterranean kept the command operating at a high tempo.\n\nAs the decade came to a close, VQ-2 found itself operating all over Europe from various NATO bases, from US Sixth Fleet carriers, as well as in Southeast Asia.\n\n===Cuban Missile Crisis===\n\nIn October 1962 the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] developed. Since the Navy had no comparable reconnaissance assets available in CONUS<ref name=\"StaHypo\" />, VQ-2 deployed a number of EA-3B and an EC-121M aircraft to [[NAS Key West]] to provide those services around Cuba. After this major superpower crisis was defused, the assets returned to Spain. The squadron's rapidity and flexibility demonstrated in Florida<ref name=\"VQH\" /> kept it very busy when it returned to Europe where it resumed missions in the Mediterranean, Baltic, and central Europe. \n===Vietnam===\n\nDuring the Vietnam War, the squadron deployed detachments to augment  VQ-1's support of US Navy operations in and around Vietnam under CINCPACFLT operational control. In late summer 1965, VQ-2 established DET ALFA at [[NAS Cubi Point]], Philippines. Sorties were routinely flown by EA-3Bs and EC-121Ms into the theater to support US Navy combat operations in Vietnam. After it sister squadron, [[VQ-1]], established its DET BRAVO flying from [[Da Nang]] Air Base in South Vietnam in 1966, VQ-2 EA-3Bs joined them operating almost exclusively from there as VQ-2 DET BRAVO<ref name=\"East\" />. From both locations, VQ-2 aircraft provided continuous electronic reconnaissance capability over the area, including the [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]] and [[Gulf of Tonkin]]<ref name=\"East\" />. As combat operations from CTF 77 on [[Yankee Station]] into North Vietnamese airspace increased, VQ-2 joined VQ-1 in deploying EA-3Bs to the attack carriers in theater. VQ-2 ceased operations from Da Nang in 1969, but continued to deploy to the aircraft carriers and Cubi Point.\n\n===Aircraft/Aircrew Losses and Mishaps===\n\nOver the course of the decade, VQ-2 suffered the fifty-two aircrew fatalities and five aircraft in seven mishaps.\n# Two days after the official move, on 16 January 1960, P4M-1Q (BUNO 124365) crashed into a mountainside at 9,000 feet om approach to crashed on approach to [[Incirlik Air Base|Incirlik AFB]]. The crew had been flying in to relieve the detachment that had been operating there<ref name=\":0\" />.

With the plane seeming to enter a stall, the pilot signalled for a crew bail out. The four aircrew in the aft compartment bailed but at 1200 feet altitude. Again, just as the crew chief was getting ready to go, the slat suddenly operated allowing a recovery at Ramstein. Although bailing out at a low altitude, the four back end crew survived.<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /><ref name=\"StaHypo\" />\n# On 4 June 1968, an EA-3B (BUNO 142670)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" />, flown by the new (by barely beyond a month)squadron CO, CDR T.E.

Tensions came to a head with the 1973 Yom Kippur War. This tempo lasted through the decade despite the overall drawdown of the US military after Vietnam.\n\nOn 9 July 1974, the squadron suffered another A-3 loss when its VIP transport-configured A-3, a TA-3B (BUNO 144863)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> crashed at [[Naples International Airport|Capodichino]] in Naples, Italy on approach. All eight aircrew perished in the crash.\n\nThroughout the remainder of the 1970s, the command suffered no aircraft losses. In 1979, the [[Iranian Revolution]] saw an increased US Presence in the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean. In response, the Navy maintained at least one carrier battle group in the vicinity of the Gulf. VQ-2 shared the manning of carrier and Diego Garcia detachments.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\"East\" /> This manning would continue until the third phase of the [[Lebanese Civil War]] in 1982.\n\n==1980s==\n[[File:EA-3B VQ-2 after landing on USS Saratoga (CV-60) c1986.jpg|left|thumb|EA-3B VQ-2 after landing on [[USS Saratoga (CV-60)|USS]] Saratoga inn 1986.]]\nAs VQ-2 entered the mid-1980s, the frenzied pace of operations including [[Operation Mole Cricket 19]](Arab-Israel [[Beqaa Valley|Beqaa]] War), and continuing with 1982 - 1983 [[Multinational Force in Lebanon|Beirut Crisis]] with the [[1983 Beirut barracks bombing|U.S. Marine barracks bombing]], and the [[United States Sixth Fleet|Sixth Fleet]] December [[Multinational Force in Lebanon|1983 air strike into Lebanon]], allowed little leisure time for the squadron.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nVQ-2 was awarded the [[Navy Expeditionary Medal]] for participation in the Beirut evacuation and operations in the vicinity of [[Libya]] during [[1986 United States bombing of Libya|Operation El Dorado Canyon]], 12\u201317 April 1986.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn 25 January 1987, an EA-3B crashed on the USS Nimitz killing all seven crew members.\n\n==1990s==\nIn the summer of 1990, the squadron provided electronic reconnaissance during the evacuation of 2000 non-combatant personnel from war-stricken [[Liberia]] in [[operation Sharp Edge]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n[[File:Lockheed EP-3E Orion (ARIES), USA - Navy AN2094464.jpg|thumb|EP-3E of VQ-2 based at Rota, Spain, seen arriving for [[Royal International Air Tattoo|RIAT]] '92.]]\nFrom August 1990 to April 1991, VQ-2 provided combat reconnaissance during operations [[Gulf War|Desert Shield/Desert Storm]], Proven Force, and [[Operation Provide Comfort|Provide Comfort]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn 29 June 1991, the first EP-3E Aries II aircraft arrived in Rota and on 20 September 1991, the squadron retired the EA-3B Skywarrior the same year.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nStarting in July 1992, VQ-2 flew support missions with Operations [[Operation Deny Flight|Deny Flight]], Provide Promise, Sharp Guard, Joint Endeavor, Decisive Endeavor, and Deliberate Guard providing combat reconnaissance and intelligence to [[NATO]] and [[United Nations]] forces in the Former [[Yugoslavia]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAs of 1997, VQ-2 operated four EP-3E Aries II aircraft and two [[Lockheed P-3 Orion|P-3C Orion]] aircraft from its home-base at Rota and two-plane detachment at [[Souda Bay|Naval Support Activity Souda Bay, Crete]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn March 1997, VQ-2 provided electronic reconnaissance during the evacuation of non-combatant personnel from [[Albania]] following unrest from a failed [[Pyramid scheme|pyramid savings scheme]] during [[Operation Silver Wake]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==2000s==\nVQ-2 relocated from NS Rota, Spain, to NAS Whidbey Island, effective 1 September 2005.

The lore states a woman was unloved  by her husband and her husband loved their two sons instead of her. She caught her husband with another woman and drowned her sons in a river. Out of grief and anger she then drowned herself. She was refused entry to heaven until she found the souls of her two sons. She cries and wails and takes children and drowns them in the river she and her sons drowned in. The legend represents La Llorona as a person or ghost. She went to hell and came back alive from coming up the same river she and her sons died in. She hunts for her ex-husband as well as children.\n\nAngel she knew one of your ancestors\nThe legend described in this article is the Mexican version of this folktale. Other regional variations of the story exist.\n\nAccording to the legend, in a rural village in [[Mexico]], there lived a beautiful young woman named Mar\u00eda. She came from a poor family but was known around her village for her beauty and grace. One day, an extremely wealthy nobleman was riding through her village and stopped in his tracks. He had traveled all over the world and has never seen anyone as beautiful as Mar\u00eda. He was mesmerized by her. He knew that he had to win her heart. '''Mar\u00eda was easily charmed by him and he was charmed by her beauty, so when he proposed to her, she immediately accepted. Eventually, the two [[married]], and Mar\u00eda gave birth to two sons. Her husband was always traveling and he stopped spending time with his family.''' When he came home, he only paid attention to the children and as time passed Mar\u00eda could tell that her husband was falling out of love with her because she was getting old. One day he returned to the village with a younger woman, and bid his children farewell, ignoring Mar\u00eda.<ref name=\"literacynet1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.literacynet.org/lp/hperspectives/llorona.html|title=LA LLORONA - A HISPANIC LEGEND|website=www.literacynet.org|access-date=2016-12-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161119025116/http://www.literacynet.org/lp/hperspectives/llorona.html|archive-date=2016-11-19|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nMar\u00eda, angry and hurt, took her children to a river and drowned them in a blind rage.

In one folk story of {{lang|es|La Malinche}}, she became Cort\u00e9s's mistress and bore him a child, only to be abandoned so that he could marry a Spanish lady (although no evidence exists that {{lang|es|La Malinche}} killed her children). Aztec pride drove {{lang|es|La Malinche}} to acts of vengeance. In this context, the tale compares the Spanish discovery of the [[New World]] and the demise of indigenous culture after the conquest with {{lang|es|La Llorona}}'s loss. Before the Spaniards arrival to Tenochtitlan, there were seven ugly omens, the sixth of those was a woman screaming during the nights crying : \"Where will I take you?,oh my children! [Miguel Le\u00f3n Portilla- Visi\u00f3n de los Vencidos, p. 21].\n\nStories of weeping female phantoms are common in the folklore of both [[Europe]]an and [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous American]] cultures. Scholars have pointed out similarities between {{lang|es|La Llorona}} and the {{lang|nah|[[Cihuac\u014d\u0101tl]]}} of [[Aztec mythology]],{{sfn|Werner|1997|p=753}} as well as [[Eve]] and [[Lilith]] of [[Old World]] mythology.{{sfn|Norget|2006|p=146}} Author [[Ben Radford]]'s investigation into the legend of {{lang|es|La Llorona}}, published in ''[[Mysterious New Mexico]]'', traced elements of the story back to a German folktale dating from 1486.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Radford|first1=Ben|title=Mysterious New Mexico|date=2014|publisher=University of New Mexico Press|location=Albuquerque|isbn=978-0-8263-5450-1|page=228|quote=While the classic image of {{lang|es|La Llorona}} was likely taken from an Aztec goddess named {{lang|nah|Cihuac\u014d\u0101tl}}, the narrative of her legend has other origins. As Bacil Kirtley (1960) wrote in Western Folklore, \"During the same decade that {{lang|es|La Llorona}} was first mentioned in Mexico, a story, seemingly already quite old, of '{{lang|de|Die Weisse Frau}}' ('The White Lady')\u2014which reproduces many of the features consistently recurring in the more developed versions of '{{lang|es|La Llorona}}', was recorded in Germany\"; references to {{lang|de|Die Weisse Frau}} date back as early as 1486. The story of the White Lady follows a virtually identical plot to the classical {{lang|es|La Llorona}} story.}}</ref>\n\nThe earliest published reference to {{lang|es|La Llorona}} occurred in a sonnet written by Mexican poet [[Manuel Carpio]] in the late 1800s. The poem makes no reference to infanticide, rather {{lang|es|La Llorona}} is identified as the ghost of a woman who was murdered by her husband.{{sfn|Werner|1997|p=753}}\n\n===Similar folktales===\nThe [[Chumash people|Chumash]] of Southern California have their own connection to {{lang|es|La Llorona}}.

[[Sarah Shahi]] portrayed Constance Welch, The Woman in White who, after discovering her husband's infidelity took the lives of her two children by drowning them in a bathtub at home and soon after, took her own by jumping off a bridge into a river. Her ghost was known to haunt the Centennial Highway, hitchhiking unknowing motorists, mostly men, and killing those whom she deemed unfaithful. Main character [[Sam Winchester]] destroyed her ghost by crashing his car into the house where she used to live. Finally facing the ghosts of her children, The Woman in White was destroyed by her own guilt from killing them.\n\nLa Llorona appears as the main antagonist of the Mexican animated film ''[[La Leyenda de la Llorona]]''. Here, La Llorona is portrayed as a more sympathetic character, with her children's deaths coming as an accident rather than at her own hands.\n\nIn 1995, Mexican playwright [[Josefina L\u00f3pez]] wrote \"Unconquered Spirits\", which uses the myth of La Llorona as a plot device. The play has two time periods, with Act One taking place in 16th Century Mexico after Spain occupied it. Here, Lopez takes inspiration from the \"La Malinche\" variation, with the heroine represented as a young Aztec girl who is brutally raped by a Spanish Friar.

The lore states a woman was unloved  by her husband and her husband loved their two sons instead of her. She caught her husband with another woman and drowned her sons in a river. Out of grief and anger she then drowned herself. She was refused entry to heaven until she found the souls of her two sons. She cries and wails and takes children and drowns them in the river she and her sons drowned in. The legend represents La Llorona as a person or ghost. She went to hell and came back alive from coming up the same river she and her sons died in. She hunts for her ex-husband as well as children.\n\nAngel she knew one of your ancestors\nThe legend described in this article is the Mexican version of this folktale. Other regional variations of the story exist.\n\nAccording to the legend, in a rural village in [[Mexico]], there lived a beautiful young woman named Mar\u00eda. She came from a poor family but was known around her village for her beauty and grace. One day, an extremely wealthy nobleman was riding through her village and stopped in his tracks. He had traveled all over the world and has never seen anyone as beautiful as Mar\u00eda. He was mesmerized by her. He knew that he had to win her heart. '''Mar\u00eda was easily charmed by him and he was charmed by her beauty, so when he proposed to her, she immediately accepted. Eventually, the two [[married]], and Mar\u00eda gave birth to two sons. Her husband was always traveling and he stopped spending time with his family.''' When he came home, he only paid attention to the children and as time passed Mar\u00eda could tell that her husband was falling out of love with her because she was getting old. One day he returned to the village with a younger woman, and bid his children farewell, ignoring Mar\u00eda.<ref name=\"literacynet1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.literacynet.org/lp/hperspectives/llorona.html|title=LA LLORONA - A HISPANIC LEGEND|website=www.literacynet.org|access-date=2016-12-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161119025116/http://www.literacynet.org/lp/hperspectives/llorona.html|archive-date=2016-11-19|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nMar\u00eda, angry and hurt, took her children to a river and drowned them in a blind rage. She realized what she had done and searched for them, but the river had already carried them away. Days later, her husband came back and asked about the children, but Maria started weeping and said that she had drowned them. Her husband was furious and said that she could not be with him unless she found their children.\n\nNow she spends eternity looking for her lost children.

Aztec pride drove {{lang|es|La Malinche}} to acts of vengeance. In this context, the tale compares the Spanish discovery of the [[New World]] and the demise of indigenous culture after the conquest with {{lang|es|La Llorona}}'s loss. Before the Spaniards arrival to Tenochtitlan, there were seven ugly omens, the sixth of those was a woman screaming during the nights crying : \"Where will I take you?,oh my children!

As Bacil Kirtley (1960) wrote in Western Folklore, \"During the same decade that {{lang|es|La Llorona}} was first mentioned in Mexico, a story, seemingly already quite old, of '{{lang|de|Die Weisse Frau}}' ('The White Lady')\u2014which reproduces many of the features consistently recurring in the more developed versions of '{{lang|es|La Llorona}}', was recorded in Germany\"; references to {{lang|de|Die Weisse Frau}} date back as early as 1486. The story of the White Lady follows a virtually identical plot to the classical {{lang|es|La Llorona}} story.}}</ref>\n\nThe earliest published reference to {{lang|es|La Llorona}} occurred in a sonnet written by Mexican poet [[Manuel Carpio]] in the late 1800s.

[[Sarah Shahi]] portrayed Constance Welch, The Woman in White who, after discovering her husband's infidelity took the lives of her two children by drowning them in a bathtub at home and soon after, took her own by jumping off a bridge into a river. Her ghost was known to haunt the Centennial Highway, hitchhiking unknowing motorists, mostly men, and killing those whom she deemed unfaithful. Main character [[Sam Winchester]] destroyed her ghost by crashing his car into the house where she used to live. Finally facing the ghosts of her children, The Woman in White was destroyed by her own guilt from killing them.\n\nLa Llorona appears as the main antagonist of the Mexican animated film ''[[La Leyenda de la Llorona]]''. Here, La Llorona is portrayed as a more sympathetic character, with her children's deaths coming as an accident rather than at her own hands.\n\nIn 1995, Mexican playwright [[Josefina L\u00f3pez]] wrote \"Unconquered Spirits\", which uses the myth of La Llorona as a plot device. The play has two time periods, with Act One taking place in 16th Century Mexico after Spain occupied it. Here, Lopez takes inspiration from the \"La Malinche\" variation, with the heroine represented as a young Aztec girl who is brutally raped by a Spanish Friar. She gives birth to twin boys as a result, and drowns them in the river out of protection rather than spite. Act Two takes place in 1938 amidst the San Antonio Pecan Sheller's Strike. A widowed mother who works at the Pecan factory has an abortion after being raped by her white supervisor, resulting in a visit from La Llorona to give her the strength to fight back against her attacker.

He became a wealthy, well-connected lawyer, state prosecutor, Wilmington city attorney, legal counsel to Governor [[Mike Castle]], and political consultant, well known in Delaware's political community. In 1994, Capano was a partner at the Wilmington office of [[Saul Ewing Arnstein & Lehr|Saul Ewing LLP]] when he became involved with 28-year-old Anne Marie Fahey, the appointments secretary to then-Governor [[Tom Carper]]. Married with four daughters, Thomas Capano separated from his wife Kay the following year.<ref>''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, November 24, 1997. p. 25</ref>\n\n==Fahey's disappearance and investigation==\nAnne Marie Fahey, the scheduling secretary for Governor Carper, became involved with the married Capano in 1994. In September 1995, while still involved with Capano, Fahey began another relationship with Michael Scanlan.<ref name=\"trial\" />\n\nShe was last seen alive on Thursday, June 27, 1996, when she went to dinner with Capano in Philadelphia.  Fahey's family reported her missing on June 30, 1996. After an extensive investigation into her disappearance, the FBI joined in the investigation in July 1996, and a federal grand jury heard evidence for over a year.<ref name=\"trial\">Capano v. State, 781 A.2d 556, 582, 2001 WL 980939 (Del. 2001).</ref> Capano, the last known person to have seen her alive, was the primary suspect.  Capano was arrested for her murder in November 1997, over sixteen months after her disappearance. However, Fahey's body was never found, and prosecutors were unable to establish the cause or manner of Fahey's death.\n\nProsecutors alleged that Capano murdered Fahey at the house he rented and, with the assistance of his brother, Gerry, dumped her body in the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. Gerry Capano owned a boat and, when it was sold, its two [[anchor]]s were missing.  On November 8, 1997, Gerry was interviewed by detectives and told them that Thomas had borrowed the boat and admitted that he had murdered someone who was attempting to extort him. They went to [[Stone Harbor, New Jersey]], with a large cooler that contained Fahey's body{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}, sailed {{convert|62|mi|km}} out to sea, and pushed the cooler overboard. Gerry told police that Thomas shot the cooler in order to sink it, but that the cooler remained afloat in the water. Thomas then retrieved the cooler, removed the body, and wrapped the anchor chains around it. Thomas also asked Gerry to help dispose of a blood-stained sofa and carpet into a dumpster, which was managed by a third brother, Louis.

He became a wealthy, well-connected lawyer, state prosecutor, Wilmington city attorney, legal counsel to Governor [[Mike Castle]], and political consultant, well known in Delaware's political community. In 1994, Capano was a partner at the Wilmington office of [[Saul Ewing Arnstein & Lehr|Saul Ewing LLP]] when he became involved with 28-year-old Anne Marie Fahey, the appointments secretary to then-Governor [[Tom Carper]]. Married with four daughters, Thomas Capano separated from his wife Kay the following year.<ref>''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, November 24, 1997. p. 25</ref>\n\n==Fahey's disappearance and investigation==\nAnne Marie Fahey, the scheduling secretary for Governor Carper, became involved with the married Capano in 1994. In September 1995, while still involved with Capano, Fahey began another relationship with Michael Scanlan.<ref name=\"trial\" />\n\nShe was last seen alive on Thursday, June 27, 1996, when she went to dinner with Capano in Philadelphia.  Fahey's family reported her missing on June 30, 1996. After an extensive investigation into her disappearance, the FBI joined in the investigation in July 1996, and a federal grand jury heard evidence for over a year.<ref name=\"trial\">Capano v. State, 781 A.2d 556, 582, 2001 WL 980939 (Del. 2001).</ref> Capano, the last known person to have seen her alive, was the primary suspect.  Capano was arrested for her murder in November 1997, over sixteen months after her disappearance. However, Fahey's body was never found, and prosecutors were unable to establish the cause or manner of Fahey's death.\n\nProsecutors alleged that Capano murdered Fahey at the house he rented and, with the assistance of his brother, Gerry, dumped her body in the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. Gerry Capano owned a boat and, when it was sold, its two [[anchor]]s were missing.  On November 8, 1997, Gerry was interviewed by detectives and told them that Thomas had borrowed the boat and admitted that he had murdered someone who was attempting to extort him. They went to [[Stone Harbor, New Jersey]], with a large cooler that contained Fahey's body{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}, sailed {{convert|62|mi|km}} out to sea, and pushed the cooler overboard. Gerry told police that Thomas shot the cooler in order to sink it, but that the cooler remained afloat in the water. Thomas then retrieved the cooler, removed the body, and wrapped the anchor chains around it. Thomas also asked Gerry to help dispose of a blood-stained sofa and carpet into a dumpster, which was managed by a third brother, Louis.  Thomas instructed Louis to empty the dumpsters outside of their regular schedule. The empty cooler was found on July 4, 1996, by a local fisherman.<ref>Meyer, Peter.
