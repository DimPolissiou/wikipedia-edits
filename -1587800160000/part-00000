She also wrote the world's longest-running play ''[[The Mousetrap]],'' performed in the [[West End theatre|West End]] since 1952, as well as six novels under the pseudonym '''Mary Westmacott'''. In 1971, she was appointed a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) for her contribution to literature.\n\nChristie was born into a wealthy upper-middle-class family in [[Torquay]], [[Devon]]. She served in a Devon hospital during the [[World War I|First World War]], acquiring a good knowledge of poisons which would later feature in many of her novels, short stories, and plays. She was initially an unsuccessful writer with six consecutive rejections, but this changed when ''[[The Mysterious Affair at Styles]]'' was published in 1920 featuring Hercule Poirot. Following her second marriage in 1930 to an archaeologist, she used her first-hand knowledge of her husband's profession in her fiction. During the [[World War II|Second World War]], she worked as a pharmacy assistant at [[University College Hospital]], London, updating her knowledge of toxins while contributing to the war effort.\n\n''[[Guinness World Records]]'' lists Christie as the best-selling novelist of all time. Her novels have sold roughly 2 billion copies, and her estate claims that her works come third in the rankings of the world's most-widely published books, behind only [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] works and the [[Bible]]. According to [[Index Translationum]], she remains the [[list of most-translated individual authors|most-translated individual author]], having been translated into at least 103 languages. ''[[And Then There Were None]]'' is Christie's best-selling novel, with 100 million sales to date, making it the world's best-selling mystery ever and one of the best-selling books of all time. Christie's stage play ''The Mousetrap'' holds the world record for longest initial run. It opened at the [[Ambassadors Theatre (London)|Ambassadors Theatre]] in the West End on 25 November 1952, and by September 2018 there had been more than 27,500 performances.\n\nIn 1955, Christie was the first recipient of the [[Mystery Writers of America]]'s [[MWA Grand Master Award|Grand Master Award]]. Later that year, ''[[Witness for the Prosecution (play)|Witness for the Prosecution]]'' received an [[Edgar Award]]  for best play. In 2013, she was voted the best crime writer and ''[[The Murder of Roger Ackroyd]]'' the best crime novel ever by 600 professional novelists of the [[Crime Writers' Association]]. In September 2015, coinciding with her 125th birthday, ''And Then There Were None'' was named the \"World's Favourite Christie\" in a vote sponsored by the author's estate. Most of Christie's books and short stories have been adapted for television, radio, video games, and comics, and more than thirty feature films have been based on her work.\n\n==Life and career==\n===Childhood and adolescence: 1890\u20131910===\nAgatha Mary Clarissa Miller<!-- Christie comes from her first marriage. --> was born on 15 September 1890 into a wealthy [[upper-middle-class]] family in Torquay, Devon.

Both books were sealed in a [[bank vault]] for over thirty years and were released for publication by Christie only at the end of her life, when she realised that she could not write any more novels.

She saw herself as an entertainer whose job was to produce what the public liked, and the public liked Poirot.<ref>{{cite web|work=The Christie Mystery|title=Agatha Christie&nbsp;\u2013 Her Detectives & Other Characters|date=22 February 2009|url=http://www.christiemystery.co.uk/detectives.html|accessdate=25 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110906011416/http://www.christiemystery.co.uk/detectives.html|archive-date=6 September 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> She did marry off Poirot's companion [[Arthur Hastings|Captain Hastings]] in an attempt to trim her cast commitments.<ref name=\"Auto1993\" />{{rp|268}}\n\nIn contrast, Christie was fond of Miss Marple. However, the Belgian detective's titles outnumber the Marple titles more than two to one. This is largely because Christie wrote numerous Poirot novels early in her career, while ''[[The Murder at the Vicarage]]'' remained the sole Marple novel until the 1940s. Christie never wrote a novel or short story featuring both Poirot and Miss Marple. In a recording discovered and released in 2008, Christie revealed the reason for this: \"Hercule Poirot, a complete egoist, would not like being taught his business or having suggestions made to him by an elderly spinster lady.

(from the [[Book of Common Prayer]]), and ''[[Come, Tell Me How You Live]]'' (from Lewis Carroll's ''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]'').\n\nChristie biographer Gillian Gill said that \"Christie's writing has the sparseness, the directness, the narrative pace, and the universal appeal of the fairy story, and it is perhaps as modern fairy stories for grown-up children that Christie's novels succeed.\"<ref name=\":10\" />{{Rp|208}} Reflecting a juxtaposition of innocence and horror, numerous Christie titles were drawn from well-known children's [[nursery rhyme]]s: ''And Then There Were None'' (from \"[[Ten Little Indians]]\"), ''[[One, Two, Buckle My Shoe (novel)|One, Two, Buckle My Shoe]]'' (from \"[[One, Two, Buckle My Shoe]]\"), ''Five Little Pigs'' (from \"[[This Little Piggy]]\"), ''[[Crooked House]]'' (from \"[[There Was a Crooked Man]]\"), ''[[A Pocket Full of Rye]]'' (from \"[[Sing a Song of Sixpence]]\"), ''[[Hickory Dickory Dock (novel)|Hickory Dickory Dock]]'' (from \"[[Hickory Dickory Dock]]\"), and ''[[Three Blind Mice and Other Stories|Three Blind Mice]]'' (from \"[[Three Blind Mice]]\"). Similarly, the novel ''[[Mrs McGinty's Dead]]'' is named after a children's game that is explained in the course of the story.\n\n====Character stereotypes====\nChristie would insert stereotyped descriptions of characters into her work, particularly before the end of the Second World War (when such attitudes were more commonly expressed publicly), and particularly in regard to Italians, Jews, and non-Europeans.<ref name=\"Morgan1984\" />{{Rp|264\u2013266}} For example, she described \"men of Hebraic extraction, sallow men with hooked noses, wearing rather flamboyant jewellery\" in the short story \"The Soul of the Croupier\" from the collection ''[[The Mysterious Mr Quin]].'' In 1947, the [[Anti-Defamation League]] in the US sent an official letter of complaint to Christie's American publishers, Dodd, Mead and Company, regarding perceived [[antisemitism]] in her works.

To contrast with the more stereotyped descriptions, Christie portrayed some \"foreign\" characters as victims, or potential victims, at the hands of English malefactors, such as, respectively, Olga Seminoff (''[[Hallowe'en Party]]'') and Katrina Reiger (in the short story \"How Does Your Garden Grow?\"). Jewish characters are often seen as un-English (such as Oliver Manders in ''Three Act Tragedy''), but they are rarely the culprits.<ref>{{Citation|last=Pendergast|first=Bruce|title=Everyman's Guide to the Mysteries of Agatha Christie|publisher=Trafford|year=2004|location=Victoria, BC, Canada|page=399|isbn=1-4120-2304-1}}</ref>\n\n==== Plays ====\n[[File:Agatha Christie Memorial (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|Memorial to Christie in central London]]\nIn 1928, ''[[The Murder of Roger Ackroyd]]'' was adapted for the stage by Michael Morton under the title ''[[Alibi (play)|Alibi]]''.<ref name=\"Morgan1984\" />{{Rp|177}} While the play enjoyed a respectable run, Christie disliked the changes made to her original work and, in future, preferred to write for the theatre herself.

The first was the 1928 British film ''[[The Passing of Mr. Quin]]''. Poirot's first film appearance was in 1931 in ''[[Alibi (1931 film)|Alibi]]'', which starred [[Austin Trevor]] as Christie's sleuth.<ref name=\":13\">{{Cite book|last=Palmer|first=Scott|title=The Films of Agatha Christie|publisher=B.T.

Although Christie personally liked the actress, she considered the first film \"pretty poor\" and thought no better of the rest.<ref name=\"thompson\" />{{Rp|430\u2013431}}\n\nShe felt differently about the 1974 film ''[[Murder on the Orient Express (1974 film)|Murder on the Orient Express]],'' directed by [[Sidney Lumet]], which featured major stars and high production values; her attendance at the London premiere was one of her last public outings.<ref name=\"thompson\" />{{Rp|476,482}}<ref name=\":13\" />{{Rp|57}} In 2016, a new film version was released, directed by [[Kenneth Branagh]], who also starred, adorned by \"the most extravagant mustache moviegoers have ever seen\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/2017/film/reviews/murder-on-the-orient-express-review-1202605173/|title=Film Review: 'Murder on the Orient Express'|last=Debruge|first=Peter|date=2 November 2017|website=variety.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=10 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nNotable television adaptations include:\n\n* ''[[Agatha Christie's Poirot]]'', with [[David Suchet]] in the title role, which ran for 70 episodes over 13 series, 1989\u20132013, and was nominated for and won various [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]] awards in 1990\u20131992<ref>{{cite web|url=http://awards.bafta.org/keyword-search?keywords=poirot|title=BAFTA Awards Database|last=|first=|date=|work=BAFTA.org|url-status=live|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20130529070546/http://awards.bafta.org/keyword-search?keywords=poirot|archivedate=29 May 2013|accessdate=10 April 2020}}</ref>\n* ''[[Miss Marple (TV series)|Miss Marple]],'' with [[Joan Hickson]] as \"the BBC's peerless Miss Marple\", which adapted all twelve Marple novels 1984\u20131992<ref name=\"thompson\" />{{Rp|500}}\n* {{Lang|fr|[[Les Petits Meurtres d'Agatha Christie]]}} (in French), including a four-part mini-series (2006) and a run of two series: 2009\u20132012 and 2013\u20132019, which adapted thirty-six of Christie's works of detective fiction.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1349600/|title=Agatha Christie's Criminal Games: Les petits meurtres d'Agatha Christie (original title)|last=|first=|date=|website=www.imdb.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=10 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Interests and influences==\n=== Pharmacology ===\nIn the midst of the First World War, Christie took a break from nursing to train for the Apothecaries Hall Examination. While she subsequently found dispensing in the hospital pharmacy monotonous, and thus less enjoyable than nursing, her new knowledge provided her with a solid background in potentially toxic drugs. Early in the Second World War, she brought her skills up-to-date at Torquay Hospital.<ref name=\"Auto1993\" />{{Rp|235,470}}\n\nAs Michael C. Gerald puts it, her \"activities as a hospital dispenser during both World Wars not only supported the war effort but also provided her with an appreciation of drugs as therapeutic agents and poisons \u2026 These hospital experiences were also likely responsible for the prominent role physicians, nurses, and pharmacists play in her stories\".<ref name=\":11\" />{{Rp|viii}} There were to be many medical practitioners, pharmacists and scientists, na\u00efve or suspicious, in Christie's future: ''Murder in Mesopotamia'', ''Cards on the Table'', ''The Pale Horse'', and ''Mrs. McGinty's Dead'', among numerous others.<ref name=\":11\" />\n\nGillian Gill also notes that the murder method in Christie's very first detective novel, ''The Mysterious Affair at Styles'', \"comes right out of Agatha Christie's work in the hospital dispensary.\"<ref name=\":10\" />{{Rp|34}} In an interview with journalist Marcelle Bernstein, Christie stated, \"I don't like messy deaths \u2026 I'm more interested in peaceful people who die in their own beds and no one knows why.\"<ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|url=|title=Agatha Christie: \u2018Queen of Crime\u2019 Is a Gentlewoman|date=8 March 1970|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=|url-status=live|page=60, quoted in Gerald (1993), p. 4.}}</ref> With her expert knowledge, Christie had no need of poisons unknown to science, which were forbidden under [[Ronald Knox]]'s \"Ten Rules for Detective Fiction\".<ref name=\":12\" />{{Rp|58}} Arsenic, aconite, strychnine, digitalis, thallium, and many other standard pharmaceuticals were utilised to dispatch victims in the ensuing decades.<ref name=\":11\" /> \n\n===Archaeology===\n{{quote box\n| align = right\n| width = 30%|\n| source = \u2013 Agatha Christie, 1977<ref name=\"Auto1993\"/>{{rp|364}}\n| quote = The lure of the past came up to grab me. To see a dagger slowly appearing, with its gold glint, through the sand was romantic. The carefulness of lifting pots and objects from the soil filled me with a longing to be an archaeologist myself.\n}}\n\nChristie had a lifelong interest in archaeology. She met her second husband, Max Mallowan, a distinguished archaeologist, on a trip to the excavation site at [[Ur]] in 1930. But her fame as an author far surpassed his fame in archaeology.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dever|first=Norma|date=2004|title=They Also Dug!

Christie accompanied Mallowan on countless archaeological trips, spending three to four months at a time in [[Syria]] and Iraq at excavation sites at Ur, [[Nineveh]], [[Tell Arpachiyah]], [[Chagar Bazar]], [[Tell Brak]], and [[Nimrud]]. She wrote novels and short stories, but also contributed work to the archaeological sites, more specifically to the archaeological restoration and labelling of ancient exhibits, including tasks such as cleaning and conserving delicate ivory pieces, reconstructing pottery, developing photos from early excavations which later led to taking photographs of the site and its findings, and taking field notes.<ref name=\"britishmuseum\">{{cite web|publisher=Trustees of the British Museum|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/online_tours/middle_east/agatha_christie__archaeology/agatha_christie__archaeology.aspx|title=Agatha Christie: Archaeology|accessdate=25 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nChristie would always pay for her own board and lodging and her travel expenses so as to not influence the funding of the archaeological excavations, and she also supported excavations as an anonymous sponsor.<ref name=\"britishmuseum\"/> During their time in the Middle East, there was also a large amount of time spent travelling to and from Mallowan's sites. Their extensive travelling was reflected in novels such as ''Murder on the Orient Express'', as well as suggesting the idea of archaeology as an adventure itself.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.comhem.se/cornelius/brand.html|title=Archaeology is a brand!|publisher=Comhem|accessdate=30 November 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120505140439/http://web.comhem.se/cornelius/brand.html|archivedate=5 May 2012}}</ref>\n\nAfter the Second World War, she chronicled her time in Syria with fondness in ''Come Tell Me How You Live''. Anecdotes, memories, funny episodes are strung in a rough timeline, with more emphasis on eccentric characters and lovely scenery than on factual accuracy.<ref name=\"mallowan\">{{cite book|last=Christie Mallowan|first=Agatha|title=Come, Tell Me How You Live|date=1990|publisher=Fontana Books|isbn=0-00-637594-4|location=London, UK|page=|pages=|orig-year=1946}}</ref> From 8 November 2001 to 24 March 2002, [[British Museum|The British Museum]] had an exhibit named ''Agatha Christie and Archaeology: Mystery in Mesopotamia'', which presented the life of Christie and the influences of archaeology in her life and works.<ref name=\"britishmuseum\"/>\n\nMany of the settings for Christie's books were directly inspired by the numerous archaeological field seasons spent in the Middle East on the sites managed by her husband Max. The extent of her time spent at the many locations featured in her books is apparent from the extreme detail in which she describes them, such as the temple of [[Abu Simbel temples|Abu Simbel]], depicted in ''Death on the Nile''.<ref name=\"Morgan1984\" />{{Rp|212}} Similarly, throughout ''Murder in Mesopotamia'' she draws upon her knowledge of daily life on a dig.<ref name=\":8\" />{{Rp|269}} Among the characters in her books, Christie has given prominence to the archaeologists and experts in Middle Eastern cultures and artefacts, most notably Dr. Eric Leidner in ''Murder in Mesopotamia'' and Signor Richetti in ''Death on the Nile''; several minor characters are archaeologists in ''They Came to Baghdad''.\n\nSome of Christie's best known novels with strong archaeological influences are:\n* ''Murder in Mesopotamia'' (1936)&nbsp;\u2013 set in the Middle East at an archaeological dig site and its associated expedition house. The main characters include archaeologist Dr. Eric Leidner, his wife, many specialists and assistants, and the men working on the site.\n* ''Death on the Nile'' (1937)&nbsp;\u2013 takes place on a tour boat on the Nile. Many archaeological sites are visited along the way and one of the main characters, Signor Richetti, is an archaeologist.\n* ''[[Appointment with Death]]'' (1938)&nbsp;\u2013 set in [[Jerusalem]] and the surrounding area. The eponymous death occurs at an old cave site in [[Petra]] and Christie provides some very descriptive details of sites which she may have visited.\n* ''[[They Came to Baghdad]]'' (1951)&nbsp;\u2013 involves an archaeologist as the heroine's love interest.\n\n==Portrayals==\nChristie has been portrayed in film and television. Biographical programmes have been made, such as [[BBC television]]'s ''[[Agatha Christie: A Life in Pictures]]'' (2004; in which she was portrayed by [[Olivia Williams]], [[Anna Massey]], and [[Bonnie Wright]], at different stages in her life), and in Season 3, Episode 1 of ''[[ITV (TV channel)|ITV Perspectives]]'': \"The Mystery of Agatha Christie\" (2013), hosted by David Suchet, who plays Hercule Poirot on television.<ref>{{cite news|work=Perspectives|publisher=ITV|title=The Mystery of Agatha Christie with David Suchet|year=2013|author=Suchet, David|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUmbf2fMF5M}}</ref>\n\nChristie has also been portrayed fictionally. Some of these portrayals have explored and offered accounts of Christie's disappearance in 1926, including:\n\n* the film ''[[Agatha (film)|Agatha]]'' (1979) with [[Vanessa Redgrave]], in which she sneaks away to plan revenge against her husband (Christie's heirs sued unsuccessfully to prevent the film's distribution<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/1083600%7C0/Agatha.html|title=Agatha|author=Axmaker, Sean|work=Turner Classic Movies|accessdate=17 June 2017}}</ref>);\n* the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' episode \"[[The Unicorn and the Wasp]]\" (17 May 2008), with [[Fenella Woolgar]], in which her disappearance is the result of her suffering a temporary breakdown owing to a brief psychic link being formed between her and an alien wasp called the [[Vespiform]]; and\n* ''[[Agatha and the Truth of Murder]]'' (2018), in which she goes under cover to solve the murder of [[Florence Nightingale]]'s [[goddaughter]], Florence Nightingale Shore.\n\nA fictionalised account of Christie's disappearance is also the central theme of a Korean musical, ''Agatha''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Musical Agatha|url=http://www.visitseoul.net/en/article/article.do?_method=view&m=0004009001001&p=06&art_id=78125&lang=en|website=VisitSeoul.com|publisher=Seoul Metropolitan Government|accessdate=10 April 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150416100240/http://www.visitseoul.net/en/article/article.do?_method=view&m=0004009001001&p=06&art_id=78125&lang=en|archivedate=16 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nOther portrayals, such as Hungarian film, ''Kojak Budapesten'' (1980; not to be confused with the 1986 comedy of the same name) create their own scenarios involving Christie's criminal skill. In the TV play, ''Murder by the Book'' (1986), Christie herself (Dame [[Peggy Ashcroft]]) murdered one of her fictional-turned-real characters, Poirot. The heroine of Liar-Soft's [[visual novel]] ''[[Shikkoku no Sharnoth: What a Beautiful Tomorrow]]'' (2008), Mary Clarissa Christie, is based on the real-life Christie. Christie features as a character in Gaylord Larsen's ''Dorothy and Agatha'' and ''The London Blitz Murders'' by Max Allan Collins.<ref>{{cite book|first=Gaylord|last=Larsen|publisher=Amazon|url=https://archive.org/details/dorothyagatha00lars|title=Dorothy and Agatha: A Mystery Novel|isbn=978-0-525-24865-1|accessdate=30 November 2012|year=1990}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|first=Max Allan|last=Collins|title=The London Blitz Murders|isbn=978-0-425-19805-6|year=2004}}</ref> A young Agatha is depicted in the Spanish historical television series ''[[Gran Hotel (TV series)|Gran Hotel]]'' (2011).

She also wrote the world's longest-running play ''[[The Mousetrap]],'' performed in the [[West End theatre|West End]] since 1952, as well as six novels under the pseudonym '''Mary Westmacott'''. In 1971, she was appointed a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) for her contribution to literature.\n\nChristie was born into a wealthy upper-middle-class family in [[Torquay]], [[Devon]]. She served in a Devon hospital during the [[World War I|First World War]], acquiring a good knowledge of poisons which would later feature in many of her novels, short stories, and plays. She was initially an unsuccessful writer with six consecutive rejections, but this changed when ''[[The Mysterious Affair at Styles]]'' was published in 1920 featuring Hercule Poirot. Following her second marriage in 1930 to an archaeologist, she used her first-hand knowledge of her husband's profession in her fiction. During the [[World War II|Second World War]], she worked as a pharmacy assistant at [[University College Hospital]], London, updating her knowledge of toxins while contributing to the war effort.\n\n''[[Guinness World Records]]'' lists Christie as the best-selling novelist of all time. Her novels have sold roughly 2 billion copies, and her estate claims that her works come third in the rankings of the world's most-widely published books, behind only [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] works and the [[Bible]]. According to [[Index Translationum]], she remains the [[list of most-translated individual authors|most-translated individual author]], having been translated into at least 103 languages. ''[[And Then There Were None]]'' is Christie's best-selling novel, with 100 million sales to date, making it the world's best-selling mystery ever and one of the best-selling books of all time. Christie's stage play ''The Mousetrap'' holds the world record for longest initial run. It opened at the [[Ambassadors Theatre (London)|Ambassadors Theatre]] in the West End on 25 November 1952, and by September 2018 there had been more than 27,500 performances.\n\nIn 1955, Christie was the first recipient of the [[Mystery Writers of America]]'s [[MWA Grand Master Award|Grand Master Award]]. Later that year, ''[[Witness for the Prosecution (play)|Witness for the Prosecution]]'' received an [[Edgar Award]]  for best play. In 2013, she was voted the best crime writer and ''[[The Murder of Roger Ackroyd]]'' the best crime novel ever by 600 professional novelists of the [[Crime Writers' Association]]. In September 2015, coinciding with her 125th birthday, ''And Then There Were None'' was named the \"World's Favourite Christie\" in a vote sponsored by the author's estate. Most of Christie's books and short stories have been adapted for television, radio, video games, and comics, and more than thirty feature films have been based on her work.\n\n==Life and career==\n===Childhood and adolescence: 1890\u20131910===\nAgatha Mary Clarissa Miller<!-- Christie comes from her first marriage. --> was born on 15 September 1890 into a wealthy [[upper-middle-class]] family in Torquay, Devon.

She also read the work of [[Edith Nesbit]], including ''[[The Story of the Treasure Seekers]]'' (1899), ''[[The Phoenix and the Carpet]]'' (1903), and ''[[The Railway Children]]'' (1906).

Both books were sealed in a [[bank vault]] for over thirty years and were released for publication by Christie only at the end of her life, when she realised that she could not write any more novels.

She saw herself as an entertainer whose job was to produce what the public liked, and the public liked Poirot.<ref>{{cite web|work=The Christie Mystery|title=Agatha Christie&nbsp;\u2013 Her Detectives & Other Characters|date=22 February 2009|url=http://www.christiemystery.co.uk/detectives.html|accessdate=25 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110906011416/http://www.christiemystery.co.uk/detectives.html|archive-date=6 September 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> She did marry off Poirot's companion [[Arthur Hastings|Captain Hastings]] in an attempt to trim her cast commitments.<ref name=\"Auto1993\" />{{rp|268}}\n\nIn contrast, Christie was fond of Miss Marple. However, the Belgian detective's titles outnumber the Marple titles more than two to one. This is largely because Christie wrote numerous Poirot novels early in her career, while ''[[The Murder at the Vicarage]]'' remained the sole Marple novel until the 1940s. Christie never wrote a novel or short story featuring both Poirot and Miss Marple. In a recording discovered and released in 2008, Christie revealed the reason for this: \"Hercule Poirot, a complete egoist, would not like being taught his business or having suggestions made to him by an elderly spinster lady. Hercule Poirot \u2013 a professional sleuth \u2013 would not be at home at all in Miss Marple's world\".<ref name=\"BBCdustyClues\" />  However, ''[[Three Act Tragedy]]'' does feature both Hercule Poirot and the elderly bachelor Mr. Satterthwaite (confederate of Harley Quin).<ref>{{Cite book|title=Three Act Tragedy|last=Christie, Agatha|date=2018|publisher=Harper Collins|isbn=978-0008255787|oclc=1027804732}}</ref>\n\nAnticipating the publication of ''Curtain'', Poirot became the first fictional character to be covered on the front page of ''The New York Times'' when his obituary was printed there on 6 August 1975.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.poirot.us/obituary.php|title=Poirot's Obituary|last=Hobbs|first=JD|date=6 August 1975|website=|publisher=Poirot|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|accessdate=11 April 2020|place=USA}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the great success of ''Curtain'', Christie gave permission for the release of ''Sleeping Murder'' sometime in 1976 but died in January 1976 before the book could be published. This may explain some of the inconsistencies compared to the rest of the Marple series; for example, Colonel Arthur Bantry, husband of Miss Marple's friend Dolly, is still alive and well in ''Sleeping Murder'' although he is noted as having died in books published earlier. It may be that Christie simply did not have time to revise the manuscript before she died.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/artists/agatha-christie/biography|title=About Agatha Christie|work=Artists|publisher=MTV|accessdate=16 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, the Christie family gave their \"full backing\" to the release of a new Poirot story, ''[[The Monogram Murders]]'', which was written by British author [[Sophie Hannah]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.agathachristie.com/the-monogram-murders|title=The Monogram Murders|publisher=Agatha Christie.com|accessdate=11 April 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403183934/http://www.agathachristie.com/the-monogram-murders/|archivedate=3 April 2015}}</ref> Hannah later released two more Poirot mysteries, ''[[Closed Casket (novel)|Closed Casket]]'', in 2016<ref name=\":7\">{{cite web|url=http://www.agathachristie.com/news/2016/an-interview-with-sophie-hannah|title=An interview with Sophie Hannah|accessdate=10 January 2018}}</ref> and [[Agatha Christie#Writings|''The Mystery of the Three-Quarters'']] in 2018.\n\n====Formula and plot devices====\nEarly in Christie's career, a reporter noted that \"her plots are possible, logical, and always new\".<ref name=\":6\" /> According to Sophie Hannah, \"At the start of each novel, she shows us an apparently impossible situation and we go mad wondering 'How can this be happening?'

(from the [[Book of Common Prayer]]), and ''[[Come, Tell Me How You Live]]'' (from Lewis Carroll's ''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]'').\n\nChristie biographer Gillian Gill said that \"Christie's writing has the sparseness, the directness, the narrative pace, and the universal appeal of the fairy story, and it is perhaps as modern fairy stories for grown-up children that Christie's novels succeed.\"<ref name=\":10\" />{{Rp|208}} Reflecting a juxtaposition of innocence and horror, numerous Christie titles were drawn from well-known children's [[nursery rhyme]]s: ''And Then There Were None'' (from \"[[Ten Little Indians]]\"), ''[[One, Two, Buckle My Shoe (novel)|One, Two, Buckle My Shoe]]'' (from \"[[One, Two, Buckle My Shoe]]\"), ''Five Little Pigs'' (from \"[[This Little Piggy]]\"), ''[[Crooked House]]'' (from \"[[There Was a Crooked Man]]\"), ''[[A Pocket Full of Rye]]'' (from \"[[Sing a Song of Sixpence]]\"), ''[[Hickory Dickory Dock (novel)|Hickory Dickory Dock]]'' (from \"[[Hickory Dickory Dock]]\"), and ''[[Three Blind Mice and Other Stories|Three Blind Mice]]'' (from \"[[Three Blind Mice]]\"). Similarly, the novel ''[[Mrs McGinty's Dead]]'' is named after a children's game that is explained in the course of the story.\n\n====Character stereotypes====\nChristie would insert stereotyped descriptions of characters into her work, particularly before the end of the Second World War (when such attitudes were more commonly expressed publicly), and particularly in regard to Italians, Jews, and non-Europeans.<ref name=\"Morgan1984\" />{{Rp|264\u2013266}} For example, she described \"men of Hebraic extraction, sallow men with hooked noses, wearing rather flamboyant jewellery\" in the short story \"The Soul of the Croupier\" from the collection ''[[The Mysterious Mr Quin]].'' In 1947, the [[Anti-Defamation League]] in the US sent an official letter of complaint to Christie's American publishers, Dodd, Mead and Company, regarding perceived [[antisemitism]] in her works. Christie's British literary agent later wrote to her US representative, authorising American publishers to \"omit the word 'Jew' when it refers to an unpleasant character in future books\".<ref name=\"thompson\" />{{Rp|386}}\n\nIn ''[[The Hollow]]'', published as late as 1946, one of the more unsympathetic characters is \"a Whitechapel Jewess with dyed hair and a voice like a [[corncrake]]&nbsp;... a small woman with a thick nose, henna red and a disagreeable voice\". To contrast with the more stereotyped descriptions, Christie portrayed some \"foreign\" characters as victims, or potential victims, at the hands of English malefactors, such as, respectively, Olga Seminoff (''[[Hallowe'en Party]]'') and Katrina Reiger (in the short story \"How Does Your Garden Grow?\"). Jewish characters are often seen as un-English (such as Oliver Manders in ''Three Act Tragedy''), but they are rarely the culprits.<ref>{{Citation|last=Pendergast|first=Bruce|title=Everyman's Guide to the Mysteries of Agatha Christie|publisher=Trafford|year=2004|location=Victoria, BC, Canada|page=399|isbn=1-4120-2304-1}}</ref>\n\n==== Plays ====\n[[File:Agatha Christie Memorial (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|Memorial to Christie in central London]]\nIn 1928, ''[[The Murder of Roger Ackroyd]]'' was adapted for the stage by Michael Morton under the title ''[[Alibi (play)|Alibi]]''.<ref name=\"Morgan1984\" />{{Rp|177}} While the play enjoyed a respectable run, Christie disliked the changes made to her original work and, in future, preferred to write for the theatre herself.

Christie accompanied Mallowan on countless archaeological trips, spending three to four months at a time in [[Syria]] and Iraq at excavation sites at Ur, [[Nineveh]], [[Tell Arpachiyah]], [[Chagar Bazar]], [[Tell Brak]], and [[Nimrud]]. She wrote novels and short stories, but also contributed work to the archaeological sites, more specifically to the archaeological restoration and labelling of ancient exhibits, including tasks such as cleaning and conserving delicate ivory pieces, reconstructing pottery, developing photos from early excavations which later led to taking photographs of the site and its findings, and taking field notes.<ref name=\"britishmuseum\">{{cite web|publisher=Trustees of the British Museum|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/online_tours/middle_east/agatha_christie__archaeology/agatha_christie__archaeology.aspx|title=Agatha Christie: Archaeology|accessdate=25 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nChristie would always pay for her own board and lodging and her travel expenses so as to not influence the funding of the archaeological excavations, and she also supported excavations as an anonymous sponsor.<ref name=\"britishmuseum\"/> During their time in the Middle East, there was also a large amount of time spent travelling to and from Mallowan's sites.

The extent of her time spent at the many locations featured in her books is apparent from the extreme detail in which she describes them, such as the temple of [[Abu Simbel temples|Abu Simbel]], depicted in ''Death on the Nile''.<ref name=\"Morgan1984\" />{{Rp|212}} Similarly, throughout ''Murder in Mesopotamia'' she draws upon her knowledge of daily life on a dig.<ref name=\":8\" />{{Rp|269}} Among the characters in her books, Christie has given prominence to the archaeologists and experts in Middle Eastern cultures and artefacts, most notably Dr. Eric Leidner in ''Murder in Mesopotamia'' and Signor Richetti in ''Death on the Nile''; several minor characters are archaeologists in ''They Came to Baghdad''.\n\nSome of Christie's best known novels with strong archaeological influences are:\n* ''Murder in Mesopotamia'' (1936)&nbsp;\u2013 set in the Middle East at an archaeological dig site and its associated expedition house. The main characters include archaeologist Dr. Eric Leidner, his wife, many specialists and assistants, and the men working on the site.\n* ''Death on the Nile'' (1937)&nbsp;\u2013 takes place on a tour boat on the Nile. Many archaeological sites are visited along the way and one of the main characters, Signor Richetti, is an archaeologist.\n* ''[[Appointment with Death]]'' (1938)&nbsp;\u2013 set in [[Jerusalem]] and the surrounding area. The eponymous death occurs at an old cave site in [[Petra]] and Christie provides some very descriptive details of sites which she may have visited.\n* ''[[They Came to Baghdad]]'' (1951)&nbsp;\u2013 involves an archaeologist as the heroine's love interest.\n\n==Portrayals==\nChristie has been portrayed in film and television. Biographical programmes have been made, such as [[BBC television]]'s ''[[Agatha Christie: A Life in Pictures]]'' (2004; in which she was portrayed by [[Olivia Williams]], [[Anna Massey]], and [[Bonnie Wright]], at different stages in her life), and in Season 3, Episode 1 of ''[[ITV (TV channel)|ITV Perspectives]]'': \"The Mystery of Agatha Christie\" (2013), hosted by David Suchet, who plays Hercule Poirot on television.<ref>{{cite news|work=Perspectives|publisher=ITV|title=The Mystery of Agatha Christie with David Suchet|year=2013|author=Suchet, David|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUmbf2fMF5M}}</ref>\n\nChristie has also been portrayed fictionally. Some of these portrayals have explored and offered accounts of Christie's disappearance in 1926, including:\n\n* the film ''[[Agatha (film)|Agatha]]'' (1979) with [[Vanessa Redgrave]], in which she sneaks away to plan revenge against her husband (Christie's heirs sued unsuccessfully to prevent the film's distribution<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/1083600%7C0/Agatha.html|title=Agatha|author=Axmaker, Sean|work=Turner Classic Movies|accessdate=17 June 2017}}</ref>);\n* the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' episode \"[[The Unicorn and the Wasp]]\" (17 May 2008), with [[Fenella Woolgar]], in which her disappearance is the result of her suffering a temporary breakdown owing to a brief psychic link being formed between her and an alien wasp called the [[Vespiform]]; and\n* ''[[Agatha and the Truth of Murder]]'' (2018), in which she goes under cover to solve the murder of [[Florence Nightingale]]'s [[goddaughter]], Florence Nightingale Shore.\n\nA fictionalised account of Christie's disappearance is also the central theme of a Korean musical, ''Agatha''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Musical Agatha|url=http://www.visitseoul.net/en/article/article.do?_method=view&m=0004009001001&p=06&art_id=78125&lang=en|website=VisitSeoul.com|publisher=Seoul Metropolitan Government|accessdate=10 April 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150416100240/http://www.visitseoul.net/en/article/article.do?_method=view&m=0004009001001&p=06&art_id=78125&lang=en|archivedate=16 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nOther portrayals, such as Hungarian film, ''Kojak Budapesten'' (1980; not to be confused with the 1986 comedy of the same name) create their own scenarios involving Christie's criminal skill.

Unfortunately, after Johns Hopkins's death in December 1873 at his city townhouse on West Saratoga Street, now site of a parking garage, between future Cathedral Street and North Charles Street, north of future [[Charles Center]] redevelopment project of 1958-1970, adjacent to old [[St. Paul's Church Rectory|St. Paul's Church (Episcopal) Rectory]] of 1789-1790, next door further to the east. The powerful crucial B&O Railroad fell into mismanagement and financial distress by the [[1890s]] with increasing cutthroat competition with the dominant [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]] regional line, the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] from the heavy expenses of boring a deep long north-south [[Baltimore Belt Line|underground tunnel]] beneath Howard Street, (finally bypassing after a half-century of waterfront rail lines placed on east-west Pratt Street) on the westside of [[Downtown Baltimore|downtown Baltimore]]. The problems of the biggest transport and industrial part of the economy.of [[Maryland]] since its founding in 1827, with its eventual financial collapse and bankruptcy was hastened by the [[Panic of 1893|Financial Panic and Recession of 1893]] and the stock's value declined drastically. Later ownership was reorganized under weaker conditions for the rest of the [[20th century]]. \n\nThe original campus of the university was established by first President [[Daniel Coit Gilman]] (1831-1908, served 1875-1901), [[Downtown Baltimore|downtown Baltimore]] along [[Howard Street (Baltimore)|North Howard Street]], between West Centre, Little Ross, and West Monument and North Eutaw Streets, on the west side of the [[Mount Vernon, Baltimore|Mount Vernon-Belvedere]] neighborhood, where buildings were already available, plus additional impressive stone and brick [[19th century]] style buildings were added facing the streets/sidewalks during the 1880s and 1890s. However, this urban location did not permit room for growth and soon the board of trustees began to look for a place to move. Unfortunately the former Hopkins summer \"Clifton\" estate had been languishing for two decades,was finally sold to the city as future [[Clifton Park (Baltimore)|Clifton Park]] in 1894. \n\nThe university relocated several miles north to the former estate, [[Homewood Museum|Homewood]], of Charles Carroll, Jr. Carroll was the son of [[Charles Carroll of Carrollton]], 1737-1832) - a conservative colonial revolutionary and  last surviving signer of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]]. Carroll Jr. built Homewood during 1801-1803 for his family under the inspiration of the new, Federal Style architecture.\n\nSeveral decades later at Homewood, the Wyman Villa of JHU Board member William Wyman was built in the 1880s in an [[Italianate architecture|Italianate]] style architecture facing North Charles Street Extended. \n\nAs a part of the Wyman donation, the University was required to dedicate part of the land to art.  As a result, the [[Baltimore Museum of Art]] founded 1914, (which has ties to but is not a part of the university), moved from its first location in the Mount Vernon-Belvedere neighborhood, a few blocks west of the [[Washington_Monument (Baltimore)|Washington Monument]], at southwest corner of West Monument and Cathedral Streets in the old former Mary Garrett townhouse. The new building was designed by American architect [[John Russell Pope]]. \n\nFurther on North Charles Street, the university owns [[Evergreen House]], the former home  of the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad|B.& O. Railroad]]'s [[John Work Garrett|Garrett]]. Evergreen House now serves as one of the two house museums operated by the university, as well as the home of the John Work Garrett Library.\n\nThe majority of buildings directly east of the Homewood Campus have been acquired by and are now owned and operated by the university\n\n==Architecture==\nThe architectural style of the campus follows the earlier [[18th century]] style of [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] architecture, followed by the similar [[Federal architecture|Federal style]] of the late 18th and early [[19th century]] period expressed in the design of [[Homewood Museum|Homewood House]], built 1801-1803, by. Most newer buildings resemble this style, being built of red brick with white marble trim. Homewood House (also occasionally known as Homewood Mansion), and  was later used for decades in the 20th century for University administrative offices and also housed the first few years of the private/independent Country School for Boys, later renamed the [[Gilman School|The Gilman School]], founded 1897 at the former Homewood Mansion (built 1801-1803), and now bearing the title of Hopkins' first president.\nBut in the late 1900s and into the current new [[21st century]] now is one of two estates/historic mansions with equisite anique decorative /furniture collections preserved as a historical/artistic house museum by The JHU as valuable cultural resource for the city/county/state and regional treasure, exhibiting period interior decor and furniture of the [[19th century|1800s]]. \n\nThe geographic open spaces of the Homewood campus is organized in several campus rectangular [[Quadrangle (architecture)|quads]], crntered around Gilman Hall, the first of two early academic structures completed on the relocated new North Baltimore spacious future campus property donated by William Wyman in 1902, prior to the [[World War I|First World War]] era, in 1914-1915.\n\nIn 1997, two miles to the east along the East 33rd Street boulevard, the university purchased the closed and vacant {{convert|200000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} former building of the old elite all-girls public secondary [[Eastern High School (Baltimore, Maryland)|Eastern High School]] (one of a set of twins with its sister school, [[Western_High_School_(Baltimore,_Maryland)|Western High]] still in existence - both founded [[1844]] as the oldest female public high schools in the nation, with this its fourth occupied structure, constructed 1936-1938, as a twin matching design to the also former WHS building of 1925-1927 on Gwynns Falls Parkway in the northwest city). Old EHS is a three-story 'H'-shaped building of red brick and limestone trim in [[Tudor Revival architecture|English Tudor Revival]] \n/ [[Jacobethan architecture|Jacobethan]] styled architectures, at the 1101 block of East 33rd Street, (between Loch Raven Boulevard and Ellerslie Avenue), two miles (1.6&nbsp;km) east of the main JHU \"Homewood\" campus and further east of the adjacent [[Waverly,_Baltimore|Waverly]] community. Old Eastern /JHMI annex campus is immediately across the street from the former famous sports site of the old [[Memorial Stadium (Baltimore)|Memorial Stadium]] and previous Municipal / Baltimore Stadium of 1922-1953 /renovated and expanded 1949-1954, where the [[Major League Baseball]] franchise / team of the [[Baltimore Orioles]] later played here in the [[American League]] during 1954 to 1991 (and earlier \"Triple AAA\" [[Minor League Baseball|minor league]] level of the longtime [[Baltimore Orioles (minor league)|Baltimore Orioles]] franchise of the [[International League]], since 1903 playing here for a last \"swan song\" decade, 1944-1953, before the \"big leagues\" returned). Also Municipal / Memorial Stadiums here hosted the following former [[NFL]] pro football's [[History of the Baltimore Colts|Baltimore Colts]] who first played here, 1947-1949 in the old [[All America Football Conference]], then following one season in the NFL of \nleagues merger for 1950;  then returning to the city for it's third and most famous incarnation in 1953-1984 on 33rd. Many Baltimoreans today cannot drive past 33rd Street and not think, reminincsing about the great sports events, opposite old Eastern High and adjacent [[Baltimore City College]]'s also landmark stone Gothic \"Castle on the Hill\" with tall bell tower and immense hilltop campus and grassy lawns with huge ancient shading oaks.\n\nThe former Eastern High building closed in 1986, after 142 years of History, with 48 of those years spent on 33rd Street in it's fourth location. With its antique interior features restored of leaded glass, terrazzo floors, arched ceilings, wood paneling and woodwork, and glazed tile brick wainscoting in the corridors, Old Eastern was reopened in 2001, largely renovated, reconstructed with upgraded infrastructure and utilities during the two previous years. The historical landmark girls public high school now occupied by administrative offices for the [[Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jhu.edu/~gazette/2000/nov0600/06swing.html|title=OnlineEastern HS Renovations in Full Swing|date=November 6, 2000 |volume=30 |issue=10|work=The Gazette |publisher=The Johns Hopkins University}}</ref>\n\nThe university undertook a major renovation of the Homewood Campus itself west of North Charles Street in 2000-2002. Asphalt, vehicle-accessible roads throughout the campus were removed, being replaced with architecturally compatible brick-paved walkways with the Georgian/Federal styles. The traffic circle located in front of the Milton S. Eisenhower Library building of the [[1960s]] era, facing North Charles, which for many years had existed as a half circle that connected to campus roads, was completed, in line with the original laid out Master Plan for the university from the early [[20th century]]. Traffic was redirected to the periphery of the campus and  architects' design and vision. Additional greenery, shrubs, flower beds and more shade trees were added throughout the campus, with the goal of making the core areas of Homewood oriented more towards people rather than vehicles, more safer, more pedestrian-friendly and more attractive and peaceful in atmosphere and appearance.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.jhu.edu/gx/background/|title=GX Project Background|date=May 13, 2002 |publisher=The Johns Hopkins University}}</ref> A number of new buildings, including Clark Hall (home to the Biomedical Engineering department), Hodson Hall (a multi-use classroom building), the Mattin Center (student arts and activities center), the Ralph S. O'Connor Recreation Center, and the New Chemistry Building, were also constructed in the early [[2000s (decade)|2000s]] (decade) as the Homewood campus approached it's centennial in 2014-2015.\n\nA second campus expansion, called \"Charles Commons\", was completed in September 2006. Expanding JHU's presence eastward across North Charles Street from Homewood, along East 33rd Street's north and south sides, between Charles and St. Paul Streets. It expanded the small previous one-block commercial district for the adjacent residential neighborhood of [[Charles_Village,_Baltimore|Charles Village]], along the 3200 block south.of 33rd Street to eventually grow up to a three block length, north to south of commercial redevelopment. But the project required the razing of several blocks of 1910s-1920s \"Daylight style\" of typical Baltimore  rowhouses with front porches and smalll grassy postage stamp-sized lawns. The approximately {{convert|350000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} development includes housing for an additional approximately 618 students, with supporting amenity spaces; a central dining facility and specialty dining area with [[seating capacity]] of approximately 330; and an approximately {{convert|29000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} book store run by [[Barnes and Noble]]'s College Division.\n\nThe newly named Decker Quadrangle development constituted the last large building site on the contiguous Homewood Campus. Its first phase included a visitors and admissions center (Mason Hall), a computational sciences building (Willard Hackerman Hall),<ref>{{cite web |title=Computational Science and Engineering Building (CSEB) |url=http://engineering.jhu.edu/~cse-building/ |publisher=Johns Hopkins University |accessdate=2007-10-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071024195515/http://engineering.jhu.edu/~cse-building/ |archivedate=2007-10-24 }}</ref>  and an underground parking structure, which together created a new academic quadrangle, further south of modern style brick Garland Hall, named in honor of Alonso G. and Virginia G. Decker of the famous [[Black and Decker]] power tools manufacturer (founded in Baltimore). Construction was completed and the new buildings and quadrangle were dedicated in [[2008]]. Importantly, the project established a new public entrance for the campus on the south side and recognizes the potential for future growth of campus activities sited across Wyman Park Drive to the west side of JHU.\n\n[[File:Gilman Hall.jpg|right|300px|thumb|<center>Gilman Hall</center>]]\nIn [[2007]], the University announced a $73 million dollarsrenovation of now landmark Gilman Hall (then approaching its 93rd year, named for the university's first and most influential president, [[Daniel Coit Gilman]], 1831-1908, served 1875-1901), the academic and architectural centerpiece of the entire Homewood Campus, sitting the style for all the subsequent construction in the rest of the 20th century. unfortunately over the nine decades, the building had grown labyrinthine and complicated, over the years, with former library stacks areas being used as offices / cubicles and only half the building's stairwells reaching all of its floors. The renovation included updates to all classrooms in the building, as well as a full replacement of the building's infrastructure utilities. The renovation involved removal of the bookstore, bank and credit union, creating more space for academic departments. The center impressive and inspiring Hutzler Undergraduate Reading Room was also renovated, and a dedicated film screening room was added. The centerpiece of the renovation was a large glass-roofed atrium, connecting the building's entrance and the Hutzler Reading Room, that now houses the University's premier archaeological artifacts collection. The building was formally rededicated on October 23, 2010 as the new home of the University's humanities departments.<ref>{{cite web|title=Johns Hopkins to Renovate Gilman Hall|url=http://www.jhu.edu/news/home07/apr07/gilman.html |publisher=Johns Hopkins University|accessdate=2007-04-14}}</ref>\n\nEarlier, in December 2008, the Trustees proposed the construction of a new Eisenhower Library addition, with the Brody Learning Commons, costing $30 million dollars. The building annex features a quiet reading room, 15 new group study rooms, a new atrium and a caf\u00e9. Ground was officially broken on June 6, 2010, with a completion date of July 2012.<ref>{{cite web|title=Johns Hopkins Announces Learning Commons|url=http://www.jhu.edu/~gazette/2008/08dec08/08blc.html |publisher=Johns Hopkins University|accessdate=2008-12-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Groundbreaking celebrates start of Brody Learning Commons|url=http://gazette.jhu.edu/2010/06/21/groundbreaking-celebrates-start-of-brody-learning-commons/ |publisher=Johns Hopkins University|accessdate=2010-10-24}}</ref>\n[[File:Lower Quad at JHU.jpg|center|thumb|500px|<center>The Lower Quad, home to the Whiting School of Engineering at The Johns Hopkins University</center>]]\n\nThe [[Space Telescope Science Institute]] is also located on the Homewood Campus and controls, analyzes, and collects data from the [[Hubble Space Telescope]], launched by the [[National Aeronautical and Space Administration]] ([[NASA]]).\n\nIn 2006, The Johns Hopkins University, began planning and working with Collegetown Development Alliance, a joint-venture team composed of the local construction/renovation firm of Struever Brothers, Eccles & Rouse and along with Capstone Development, teamed up to develop a mixed-use project featuring student housing, a central dining facility and a major campus book store, for the eastward expansion project reaching across North Charles Street towards St. Paul Street.\n\n===Milton S. Eisenhower Library===\n[[File:JHU Eisenhower Library.jpg|250px|right|thumb|Milton S. Eisenhower Library]]\nThe Milton S. Eisenhower Library (called \"MSE\" by \"Blue Jay\" students), is [[Johns Hopkins University|The Johns Hopkins University]] principal research library and the largest in a network of libraries at Johns Hopkins. This network, now known as 'The Sheridan Libraries', encompasses the earlier 1960s era Milton S. Eisenhower Library and its collections at the Albert D.

Unfortunately, after Johns Hopkins's death in December 1873 at his city townhouse on West Saratoga Street, now site of a parking garage, between future Cathedral Street and North Charles Street, north of future [[Charles Center]] redevelopment project of 1958-1970, adjacent to old [[St. Paul's Church Rectory|St. Paul's Church (Episcopal) Rectory]] of 1789-1790, next door further to the east. The powerful crucial B&O Railroad fell into mismanagement and financial distress by the [[1890s]] with increasing cutthroat competition with the dominant [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]] regional line, the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] from the heavy expenses of boring a deep long north-south [[Baltimore Belt Line|underground tunnel]] beneath Howard Street, (finally bypassing after a half-century of waterfront rail lines placed on east-west Pratt Street) on the westside of [[Downtown Baltimore|downtown Baltimore]]. The problems of the biggest transport and industrial part of the economy.of [[Maryland]] since its founding in 1827, with its eventual financial collapse and bankruptcy was hastened by the [[Panic of 1893|Financial Panic and Recession of 1893]] and the stock's value declined drastically. Later ownership was reorganized under weaker conditions for the rest of the [[20th century]]. \n\nThe original campus of the university was established by first President [[Daniel Coit Gilman]] (1831-1908, served 1875-1901), [[Downtown Baltimore|downtown Baltimore]] along [[Howard Street (Baltimore)|North Howard Street]], between West Centre, Little Ross, and West Monument and North Eutaw Streets, on the west side of the [[Mount Vernon, Baltimore|Mount Vernon-Belvedere]] neighborhood, where buildings were already available, plus additional impressive stone and brick [[19th century]] style buildings were added facing the streets/sidewalks during the 1880s and 1890s. However, this urban location did not permit room for growth and soon the board of trustees began to look for a place to move. Unfortunately the former Hopkins summer \"Clifton\" estate had been languishing for two decades,was finally sold to the city as future [[Clifton Park (Baltimore)|Clifton Park]] in 1894. \n\nThe university relocated several miles north to the former estate, [[Homewood Museum|Homewood]], of Charles Carroll, Jr. Carroll was the son of [[Charles Carroll of Carrollton]], 1737-1832) - a conservative colonial revolutionary and  last surviving signer of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]]. Carroll Jr. built Homewood during 1801-1803 for his family under the inspiration of the new, Federal Style architecture.\n\nSeveral decades later at Homewood, the Wyman Villa of JHU Board member William Wyman was built in the 1880s in an [[Italianate architecture|Italianate]] style architecture facing North Charles Street Extended. \n\nAs a part of the Wyman donation, the University was required to dedicate part of the land to art.  As a result, the [[Baltimore Museum of Art]] founded 1914, (which has ties to but is not a part of the university), moved from its first location in the Mount Vernon-Belvedere neighborhood, a few blocks west of the [[Washington_Monument (Baltimore)|Washington Monument]], at southwest corner of West Monument and Cathedral Streets in the old former Mary Garrett townhouse. The new building was designed by American architect [[John Russell Pope]]. \n\nFurther on North Charles Street, the university owns [[Evergreen House]], the former home  of the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad|B.& O. Railroad]]'s [[John Work Garrett|Garrett]]. Evergreen House now serves as one of the two house museums operated by the university, as well as the home of the John Work Garrett Library.\n\nThe majority of buildings directly east of the Homewood Campus have been acquired by and are now owned and operated by the university\n\n==Architecture==\nThe architectural style of the campus follows the earlier [[18th century]] style of [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] architecture, followed by the similar [[Federal architecture|Federal style]] of the late 18th and early [[19th century]] period expressed in the design of [[Homewood Museum|Homewood House]], built 1801-1803, by. Most newer buildings resemble this style, being built of red brick with white marble trim. Homewood House (also occasionally known as Homewood Mansion), and  was later used for decades in the 20th century for University administrative offices and also housed the first few years of the private/independent Country School for Boys, later renamed the [[Gilman School|The Gilman School]], founded 1897 at the former Homewood Mansion (built 1801-1803), and now bearing the title of Hopkins' first president.\nBut in the late 1900s and into the current new [[21st century]] now is one of two estates/historic mansions with equisite anique decorative /furniture collections preserved as a historical/artistic house museum by The JHU as valuable cultural resource for the city/county/state and regional treasure, exhibiting period interior decor and furniture of the [[1800s]]. \n\nThe geographic open spaces of the Homewood campus is organized in several campus rectangular [[Quadrangle (architecture)|quads]], crntered around Gilman Hall, the first of two early academic structures completed on the relocated new North Baltimore spacious future campus property donated by William Wyman in 1902, prior to the [[World War I|First World War]] era, in 1914-1915.\n\nIn 1997, two miles to the east along the East 33rd Street boulevard, the university purchased the closed and vacant {{convert|200000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} former building of the old elite all-girls public secondary [[Eastern High School (Baltimore, Maryland)|Eastern High School]] (one of a set of twins with its sister school, [[Western_High_School_(Baltimore,_Maryland)|Western High]] still in existence - both founded [[1844]] as the oldest female public high schools in the nation, with this its fourth occupied structure, constructed 1936-1938, as a twin matching design to the also former WHS building of 1925-1927 on Gwynns Falls Parkway in the northwest city). Old EHS is a three-story 'H'-shaped building of red brick and limestone trim in [[Tudor Revival architecture|English Tudor Revival]] \n/ [[Jacobethan architecture|Jacobethan]] styled architectures, at the 1101 block of East 33rd Street, (between Loch Raven Boulevard and Ellerslie Avenue), two miles (1.6&nbsp;km) east of the main JHU \"Homewood\" campus and further east of the adjacent [[Waverly,_Baltimore|Waverly]] community. Old Eastern /JHMI annex campus is immediately across the street from the former famous sports site of the old [[Memorial Stadium (Baltimore)|Memorial Stadium]] and previous Municipal / Baltimore Stadium of 1922-1953 /renovated and expanded 1949-1954, where the [[Major League Baseball]] franchise / team of the [[Baltimore Orioles]] later played here in the [[American League]] during 1954 to 1991 (and earlier \"Triple AAA\" [[Minor League Baseball|minor league]] level of the longtime [[Baltimore Orioles (minor league)|Baltimore Orioles]] franchise of the [[International League]], since 1903 playing here for a last \"swan song\" decade, 1944-1953, before the \"big leagues\" returned). Also Municipal / Memorial Stadiums here hosted the following former [[NFL]] pro football's [[History of the Baltimore Colts|Baltimore Colts]] who first played here, 1947-1949 in the old [[All America Football Conference]], then following one season in the NFL of \nleagues merger for 1950;  then returning to the city for it's third and most famous incarnation in 1953-1984 on 33rd.

With its antique interior features restored of leaded glass, terrazzo floors, arched ceilings, wood paneling and woodwork, and glazed tile brick wainscoting in the corridors, Old Eastern was reopened in 2001, largely renovated, reconstructed with upgraded infrastructure and utilities during the two previous years.

Asphalt, vehicle-accessible roads throughout the campus were removed, being replaced with architecturally compatible brick-paved walkways with the Georgian/Federal styles. The traffic circle located in front of the Milton S. Eisenhower Library building of the [[1960s]] era, facing North Charles, which for many years had existed as a half circle that connected to campus roads, was completed, in line with the original laid out Master Plan for the university from the early [[20th century]]. Traffic was redirected to the periphery of the campus and  architects' design and vision. Additional greenery, shrubs, flower beds and more shade trees were added throughout the campus, with the goal of making the core areas of Homewood oriented more towards people rather than vehicles, more safer, more pedestrian-friendly and more attractive and peaceful in atmosphere and appearance.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.jhu.edu/gx/background/|title=GX Project Background|date=May 13, 2002 |publisher=The Johns Hopkins University}}</ref> A number of new buildings, including Clark Hall (home to the Biomedical Engineering department), Hodson Hall (a multi-use classroom building), the Mattin Center (student arts and activities center), the Ralph S.

Expanding JHU's presence eastward across North Charles Street from Homewood, along East 33rd Street's north and south sides, between Charles and St. Paul Streets. It expanded the small previous one-block commercial district for the adjacent residential neighborhood of [[Charles_Village,_Baltimore|Charles Village]], along the 3200 block south.of 33rd Street to eventually grow up to a three block length, north to south of commercial redevelopment. But the project required the razing of several blocks of 1910s-1920s \"Daylight style\" of typical Baltimore  rowhouses with front porches and smalll grassy postage stamp-sized lawns. The approximately {{convert|350000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} development includes housing for an additional approximately 618 students, with supporting amenity spaces; a central dining facility and specialty dining area with [[seating capacity]] of approximately 330; and an approximately {{convert|29000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} book store run by [[Barnes and Noble]]'s College Division.\n\nThe newly named Decker Quadrangle development constituted the last large building site on the contiguous Homewood Campus.

The renovation included updates to all classrooms in the building, as well as a full replacement of the building's infrastructure utilities. The renovation involved removal of the bookstore, bank and credit union, creating more space for academic departments. The center impressive and inspiring Hutzler Undergraduate Reading Room was also renovated, and a dedicated film screening room was added. The centerpiece of the renovation was a large glass-roofed atrium, connecting the building's entrance and the Hutzler Reading Room, that now houses the University's premier archaeological artifacts collection.

Noteworthy is that the new free [[Russian Federation]]'s first President [[Boris Yeltsin]] stayed there briefly as a guest, and the house was also used as a location during the filming of the political drama feature film, ''[[The Seduction of Joe Tynan]]'' (1979), starring [[Alan Alda]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.jhu.edu/jhumag/1196web/editnote.html|work=Johns Hopkins Magazine|date=November 1996|title=Rolling Out the Welcome Mat|first=Sue |last=De Pasquale|accessdate=2010-11-20}}</ref> In 1996, [[William R.

At the [[1928 Summer Olympics]] in Amsterdam and [[Lacrosse at the 1932 Summer Olympics|1932 Los Angeles Summer Olympics lacrosse demonstration events]] Hopkins represented the US and team members received Olympic Gold Medals. This was the only such accolade in the history of US college sports.

In 1939 [[Alfred Jenkins Shriver]], a local lawyer who specialized in estates and testaments, left the University the residue of his estate to build a lecture hall. According to the conditions of the will, the building's walls were adorned with murals depicting the Hopkins class of 1891 (Shriver's class), ten philanthropists of Baltimore, ten famous beauties of Baltimore (as chosen by Shriver), the early Hopkins faculties of philosophy and medicine, the original Boards of Trustees of the University and Hospital, and Baltimore clipper ships. In addition, statues of President [[Daniel Coit Gilman]] and [[William H. Welch]], first dean of the School of Medicine, flank the entrance to the building.
