The SHA-2 family consists of six hash functions with [[cryptographic hash function#message digest|digests]] (hash values) that are 224, 256, 384 or 512 bits: '''SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512, SHA-512/224, SHA-512/256'''. SHA-256 and SHA-512 are novel hash functions computed with 32-bit and 64-bit words, respectively. They use different shift amounts and additive constants, but their structures are otherwise virtually identical, differing only in the number of rounds. SHA-224 and SHA-384 are truncated versions of SHA-256 and SHA-512 respectively, computed with different initial values. SHA-512/224 and SHA-512/256 are also truncated versions of SHA-512, but the initial values are generated using the method described in [[Federal Information Processing Standards]] (FIPS) PUB 180-4.\n\nSHA-2 was first published by the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) as a U.S. federal standard (FIPS). The SHA-2 family of algorithms are patented in US patent 6829355.<ref>{{cite patent|US|6829355}}</ref> The United States has released the patent under a [[royalty-free]] license.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Licensing Declaration for US patent 6829355.|url=https://datatracker.ietf.org/ipr/858/|accessdate=2008-02-17}}</ref>\n\nCurrently, the best public attacks break [[preimage attack|preimage resistance]] for 52 out of 64 rounds of SHA-256 or 57 out of 80 rounds of SHA-512, and [[collision attack|collision resistance]] for 46 out of 64 rounds of SHA-256.<ref name=preimage-khov/><ref name=collision-lamberger/>\n\n==Hash standard==\n[[File:SHA-2.svg|thumbnail|right|400px|One iteration in a SHA-2 family compression function.\nThe blue components perform the following operations:<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<math>\\operatorname{Ch}(E,F,G) = (E \\land F) \\oplus (\\neg E \\land G)</math><br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<math>\\operatorname{Ma}(A,B,C) = (A \\land B) \\oplus (A \\land C) \\oplus (B \\land C)</math><br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<math>\\Sigma_0(A) = (A\\!\\ggg\\!2) \\oplus (A\\!\\ggg\\!13) \\oplus (A\\!\\ggg\\!22)</math><br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<math>\\Sigma_1(E) = (E\\!\\ggg\\!6) \\oplus (E\\!\\ggg\\!11) \\oplus (E\\!\\ggg\\!25)</math> <br />\nThe bitwise rotation uses different constants for SHA-512.

The algorithms are collectively known as SHA-2, named after their digest lengths (in bits): SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512.\n\nThe algorithms were first published in 2001 in the draft FIPS PUB 180-2, at which time public review and comments were accepted. In August 2002, FIPS PUB 180-2 became the new [[Secure Hash Standard]], replacing FIPS PUB 180-1, which was released in April 1995. The updated standard included the original SHA-1 algorithm, with updated technical notation consistent with that describing the inner workings of the SHA-2 family.<ref name=\":0\">Federal Register Notice 02-21599, [https://federalregister.gov/a/02-21599 Announcing Approval of FIPS Publication 180-2]</ref>\n\nIn February 2004, a change notice was published for FIPS PUB 180-2, specifying an additional variant, SHA-224, defined to match the key length of two-key [[Triple DES]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips180-2/fips180-2withchangenotice.pdf |title=FIPS 180-2 with Change Notice 1|website=csrc.nist.gov}}</ref> In October 2008, the standard was updated in FIPS PUB 180-3, including SHA-224 from the change notice, but otherwise making no fundamental changes to the standard.

Additionally, a restriction on [[Padding (cryptography)|padding]] the input data prior to hash calculation was removed, allowing hash data to be calculated simultaneously with content generation, such as a real-time video or audio feed.

This is called a [[preimage attack]] and may or may not be practical depending on ''L'' and the particular computing environment. The second criterion, finding two different messages that produce the same message digest, known as a [[Collision (computer science)|collision]], requires on average only 2<sup>''L''/2</sup> evaluations using a [[birthday attack]].\n\nSome of the applications that use cryptographic hashes, such as password storage, are only minimally affected by a [[collision attack]]. Constructing a password that works for a given account requires a preimage attack, as well as access to the hash of the original password (typically in the <code>[[Shadow password|shadow]]</code> file) which may or may not be trivial. Reversing password encryption (e.g., to obtain a password to try against a user's account elsewhere) is not made possible by the attacks. (However, even a secure password hash cannot prevent brute-force attacks on [[password strength|weak passwords]].)\n\nIn the case of document signing, an attacker could not simply fake a signature from an existing document\u2014the attacker would have to produce a pair of documents, one innocuous and one damaging, and get the private key holder to sign the innocuous document. There are practical circumstances in which this is possible; until the end of 2008, it was possible to create forged [[Transport Layer Security|SSL]] certificates using an [[MD5]] collision which would be accepted by widely used web browsers.<ref>Alexander Sotirov, Marc Stevens, Jacob Appelbaum, Arjen Lenstra, David Molnar, Dag Arne Osvik, Benne de Weger, [http://www.win.tue.nl/hashclash/rogue-ca/ MD5 considered harmful today: Creating a rogue CA certificate], accessed March 29, 2009.</ref>\n\nIncreased interest in cryptographic hash analysis during the SHA-3 competition produced several new attacks on the SHA-2 family, the best of which are given in the table below. Only the collision attacks are of practical complexity; none of the attacks extend to the full round hash function.\n\nAt [[Fast Software Encryption|FSE]] 2012, researchers at [[Sony]] gave a presentation suggesting pseudo-collision attacks could be extended to 52 rounds on SHA-256 and 57 rounds on SHA-512 by building upon the [[biclique attack|biclique]] pseudo-preimage attack.<ref>Ji Li, Takanori Isobe and Kyoji Shibutani, Sony China Research Laboratory and Sony Corporation, [http://fse2012.inria.fr/SLIDES/67.pdf Converting Meet-in-the-Middle Preimage Attack into Pseudo Collision Attack: Application to SHA-2 ]</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

While SHA-256 is designed for 32-bit calculations, it does benefit from code optimized for 64-bit processors on the x86 architecture. 32-bit implementations of SHA-512 are significantly slower than their 64-bit counterparts. Variants of both algorithms with different output sizes will perform similarly, since the message expansion and compression functions are identical, and only the initial hash values and output sizes are different.

The SHA-2 family consists of six hash functions with [[cryptographic hash function#message digest|digests]] (hash values) that are 224, 256, 384 or 512 bits: '''SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512, SHA-512/224, SHA-512/256'''. SHA-256 and SHA-512 are novel hash functions computed with 32-bit and 64-bit words, respectively. They use different shift amounts and additive constants, but their structures are otherwise virtually identical, differing only in the number of rounds. SHA-224 and SHA-384 are truncated versions of SHA-256 and SHA-512 respectively, computed with different initial values. SHA-512/224 and SHA-512/256 are also truncated versions of SHA-512, but the initial values are generated using the method described in [[Federal Information Processing Standards]] (FIPS) PUB 180-4.\n\nSHA-2 was first published by the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) as a U.S. federal standard (FIPS). The SHA-2 family of algorithms are patented in US patent 6829355.<ref>{{cite patent|US|6829355}}</ref> The United States has released the patent under a [[royalty-free]] license.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Licensing Declaration for US patent 6829355.|url=https://datatracker.ietf.org/ipr/858/|accessdate=2008-02-17}}</ref>\n\nCurrently, the best public attacks break [[preimage attack|preimage resistance]] for 52 out of 64 rounds of SHA-256 or 57 out of 80 rounds of SHA-512, and [[collision attack|collision resistance]] for 46 out of 64 rounds of SHA-256.<ref name=preimage-khov/><ref name=collision-lamberger/>\n\n==Hash standard==\n[[File:SHA-2.svg|thumbnail|right|400px|One iteration in a SHA-2 family compression function.\nThe blue components perform the following operations:<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<math>\\operatorname{Ch}(E,F,G) = (E \\land F) \\oplus (\\neg E \\land G)</math><br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<math>\\operatorname{Ma}(A,B,C) = (A \\land B) \\oplus (A \\land C) \\oplus (B \\land C)</math><br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<math>\\Sigma_0(A) = (A\\!\\ggg\\!2) \\oplus (A\\!\\ggg\\!13) \\oplus (A\\!\\ggg\\!22)</math><br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<math>\\Sigma_1(E) = (E\\!\\ggg\\!6) \\oplus (E\\!\\ggg\\!11) \\oplus (E\\!\\ggg\\!25)</math> <br />\nThe bitwise rotation uses different constants for SHA-512.

The algorithms are collectively known as SHA-2, named after their digest lengths (in bits): SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512.\n\nThe algorithms were first published in 2001 in the draft FIPS PUB 180-2, at which time public review and comments were accepted. In August 2002, FIPS PUB 180-2 became the new [[Secure Hash Standard]], replacing FIPS PUB 180-1, which was released in April 1995. The updated standard included the original SHA-1 algorithm, with updated technical notation consistent with that describing the inner workings of the SHA-2 family.<ref name=\":0\">Federal Register Notice 02-21599, [https://federalregister.gov/a/02-21599 Announcing Approval of FIPS Publication 180-2]</ref>\n\nIn February 2004, a change notice was published for FIPS PUB 180-2, specifying an additional variant, SHA-224, defined to match the key length of two-key [[Triple DES]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips180-2/fips180-2withchangenotice.pdf |title=FIPS 180-2 with Change Notice 1|website=csrc.nist.gov}}</ref> In October 2008, the standard was updated in FIPS PUB 180-3, including SHA-224 from the change notice, but otherwise making no fundamental changes to the standard.

This is called a [[preimage attack]] and may or may not be practical depending on ''L'' and the particular computing environment. The second criterion, finding two different messages that produce the same message digest, known as a [[Collision (computer science)|collision]], requires on average only 2<sup>''L''/2</sup> evaluations using a [[birthday attack]].\n\nSome of the applications that use cryptographic hashes, such as password storage, are only minimally affected by a [[collision attack]]. Constructing a password that works for a given account requires a preimage attack, as well as access to the hash of the original password (typically in the <code>[[Shadow password|shadow]]</code> file) which may or may not be trivial. Reversing password encryption (e.g., to obtain a password to try against a user's account elsewhere) is not made possible by the attacks. (However, even a secure password hash cannot prevent brute-force attacks on [[password strength|weak passwords]].)\n\nIn the case of document signing, an attacker could not simply fake a signature from an existing document\u2014the attacker would have to produce a pair of documents, one innocuous and one damaging, and get the private key holder to sign the innocuous document. There are practical circumstances in which this is possible; until the end of 2008, it was possible to create forged [[Transport Layer Security|SSL]] certificates using an [[MD5]] collision which would be accepted by widely used web browsers.<ref>Alexander Sotirov, Marc Stevens, Jacob Appelbaum, Arjen Lenstra, David Molnar, Dag Arne Osvik, Benne de Weger, [http://www.win.tue.nl/hashclash/rogue-ca/ MD5 considered harmful today: Creating a rogue CA certificate], accessed March 29, 2009.</ref>\n\nIncreased interest in cryptographic hash analysis during the SHA-3 competition produced several new attacks on the SHA-2 family, the best of which are given in the table below.

While SHA-256 is designed for 32-bit calculations, it does benefit from code optimized for 64-bit processors on the x86 architecture. 32-bit implementations of SHA-512 are significantly slower than their 64-bit counterparts. Variants of both algorithms with different output sizes will perform similarly, since the message expansion and compression functions are identical, and only the initial hash values and output sizes are different.

Leaning against Peace's proper right leg, Genius holds a torch that symbolizes [[immortality]] in his proper right hand. Peace stands in front of an [[olive tree]]. To Peace's proper left is a figure of [[Agriculture]], and next to that figure is a [[reaper]] with his assistant, a farmer with his [[bull]], a [[putti]] carrying [[grapes]], and a mother with her child who plays with a [[sheep|ram]]. To the proper right of Peace is [[Industry]], and next to him is a [[printmaker]], an [[ironworker]], a founder, a factory girl and a [[fisherman]]. The corners of the pediment have waves, which represent the [[Atlantic ocean|Atlantic]] and [[Pacific ocean]]s. The pediment is made of [[Georgia marble]].<ref name=\"SOS\"/>\n\n===Condition===\n\nIn 1993 ''Apotheosis of Democracy'' was surveyed by art conservators from the Save Outdoor Sculpture! program and was described as \"well maintained.\"<ref name=\"SOS\"/>\n\n==Acquisition, creation and installation==\n[[File:Capitol House of Rep Washington.jpg|thumb|left|300px|]]\n\nThe original pediment was commissioned to [[Erastus Dow Palmer]] in 1857, however, the work was never completed due to lack of funding. Another competition was held in 1908 and Bartlett was chosen.<ref name=\"SOS\"/> The figures were modeled in [[Paris, France]] and Washington between the years of 1911-1914 and carved by the [[Piccirilli Brothers]] from 1914-1916. The pediment was dedicated on August 2, 1916.<ref name=\"AOC\">{{cite web | author=Architect of the Capitol | title=Apotheosis of Democracy | work=Capitol Campus | publisher=Architect of the Capitol | url=http://www.aoc.gov/cc/art/pediments/apoth_hse.cfm | accessdate=15 Feb 2011 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110203094200/http://www.aoc.gov/cc/art/pediments/apoth_hse.cfm | archivedate=3 February 2011 | url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Related works==\n\nIn March, 1963 plaster [[maquette]]s of the pediment were given to the U.S. Government by Bartlett's stepdaughter, Armistead Peter III. The works are on display in the Capitol underground hallway that heads to the [[Rayburn House Office Building]].<ref name=\"SOS\"/>\n\nAs of 1995 a ''Study for Apotheosis of Democracy'' by Bartlett was in the collection of the [[Westmoreland Museum of American Art]]. A bronze sculpture (54 x 54.5 x 18) on a wooden base, it depicts Peace and Genius. It was purchased in 1959 and as of 1995 it was surveyed as needing urgent treatment.<ref name=\"SOS\" />\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of public art in Washington, D.C., Ward 6]]\n\n==Further reading==\n\n*Allen, William C.

He served under the first seven governors of the Colony, and from 1810 to 1821, he was ''great assistant'' to Governor [[Lachlan Macquarie]]. Wentworth led a campaign for the rights and recognition of [[Emancipist|emancipists]] and for [[trial by jury]].<ref>W.W.Walker, ''[[Jane & D'Arcy: Jane Austen & D'Arcy Wentworth]]'' Volume 2, ''[[Such Talent& Such Success]]'', Arcana Press, 2017, page 315</ref>\n\n== Early life ==\nD'Arcy Wentworth was born in [[Portadown]], [[County Armagh]], [[Ireland]], the sixth child and fourth son of Martha and D'Arcy Wentworth. His family had left Yorkshire for safe haven in Ireland after the execution of [[Thomas Wentworth, Earl of Strafford]], in 1641. In 1778, aged sixteen, D'Arcy was apprenticed to Alexander Patton, a surgeon-apothecary, in nearby [[Tandragee]]. In 1782, he joined the [[Ulster Volunteers]], one of the local regiments formed during the [[American War of Independence]], to defend Ireland against invasion from France. In May 1785, having completed a seven-year apprenticeship, D'Arcy left Ireland. He was seeking an appointment with the [[East India Company]], and as the training of Irish surgeons was not recognised in England, it was necessary to go to London to gain accreditation.\n\n== Life in England ==\nWentworth sailed on the mailboat from Donaghadee to Portpatrick in Scotland. First he went to South Yorkshire, as the guest of his cousin, [[William Wentworth-Fitzwilliam, 4th Earl Fitzwilliam]], at ''[[Wentworth Woodhouse]].'' It was the beginning os a lifelong friendship. Fitzwilliam gave D'Arcy encouragement and advice. He attended Whig party gatherings and race meetings at [[York]], [[Doncaster]] and [[Wakefield]] with Fitzwilliam, who introduced him to the societies of York and London, with their up and coming lawyers, young politicians and aspiring bureaucrats. \n\nOn 1 December 1785, Wentworth went before the Court of Examiners of the Company of Surgeons in London. He qualified as a ''Mate to Indiamen,'' eligible to work with the East India Companyonce he had twelve months practical experience ''walking the wards'' in one of London's large charity hospitals.<ref>Royal College of Surgeons, \"Company of Surgeons Examination Book 1745-1800, page 11.</ref> Wentworth accepted the invitation of [[Percivall Pott]],one of his examiners, to ''walk the wards'' of St Bartholomew's, Smithfield under his direction. He attended lectures by other prominent physicians such as [[John Hunter]],and dissections held in the Company of Surgeons' anatomy theatre at the Old Bailey.\n\nWentworth waited in vain for a position to become available in the [[East India Company]]. [[Warren Hastings]] had brought peace to India, and the Company had an over supply of surgeons. Wentworth supported himself in London by mastering the art of card playing, and gambling at card tables in several inns and coffee houses. He found that many of those who lost to him would simply refuse to pay.\n\nEventually, Wentworth pursued a number of prominent players who had defaulted on their debts. Chief Magistrate and novelist, [[Henry Fielding]], had described gambling as, ''the School in which most Highwaymen of great Eminence have been bred.'' <ref>Henry Fielding, \u201cAn Enquiry into the Causes of the Late Increase in Robbers\u201d, London, 1751, Part III.</ref> Wentworth was arraigned before the Courts four times for highway robbery, but never convicted. On each occasion his defaulter either failed to appear to prosecute him, found himself unable to positively identify D'Arcy Wentworth, or sought only to name and shame him. \n\nIn March 1787, Fitzwilliam's patronage secured him a direction from the Home Office, to leave without delay for [[Portsmouth]], where the [[First Fleet]] was making ready to sail to [[Botany Bay]]. He was to seek out [[John White]], Principal Surgeon, on the ''[[Charlotte]]'', who could advise him of any vacancies for assistant surgeons on the Fleet. D'Arcy learnt  that to become a naval surgeon he would require another accreditation from the Company of Surgeons. He returned to his studies, and on 5 July 1897, he appeared before the Court of Examiners once again and qualified as an Assistant Surgeon, Second Mate, Third Rate.<ref>Royal College of Surgeons, ''Company of Surgeons Examination Book 1745-1800'', page 22. The rate determined the class of vessel on which the Assistant Surgeon could serve, according to the number of her cannons.</ref>\n\n== Arrival in the Colony of New South Wales ==                                   \nOn 17 January 1790, Wentworth left England on the [[Second Fleet (Australia)|Second Fleet]] on board the ''[[Neptune (1780 ship)|Neptune]]'', the most notorious of the convict transports. The neglect and ill treatment of her convicts resulted in the deaths of one hundred and forty-seven men and eleven women, over 30% of the.convicts she transported. Wentworth was on board as a passenger, he had no influence, no position on the ship and no employment arranged in the Colony. He arrived in Sydney on 26 June 1790, he spent his first five weeks assisting the local surgeons to care for the newly arrived convicts. \n\nThe Colony was short of food, strict rationing had been in place for three months. Five weeks after the ''[[Neptune]]'' arrived, to avoid a worsening disaster, Governor [[Arthur Phillip]] sent nearly 200 convicts and their superintendents to [[Norfolk Island]] on the ''[[Surprize (1780 ship)|Surprize]]''. Wentworth was sent with them, ''to act as an assistant to the surgeon there, being reputed to have the necessary requisites for such a situation\".<ref>Captain David Collins, \"Diary\", 1 August 1780.</ref>\n\nWentworth went ashore on Norfolk Island on 16 August 1790. The Commandant, Lt. Governor [[Philip Gidley King]] appointed him as an unpaid Assistant Surgeon. On the island, he became a good friend of Captain [[John Hunter]], whose vessel, ''[[HMS Sirius (1786)|HMS Sirius]]'', was wrecked on a sunken reef off the island five months earlier. Hunter and most of his crew were stranded there for nearly a year, awaiting a vessel to return to Sydney. \n\nIn December 1791, King appointed Wentworth to a second, paid position on [[Norfolk Island]], as Superintendent of Convicts, responsible for overseeing up to 150 convict labourers on building projects, land clearing and farm work.<ref>Lieut. Governor King to Governor Phillip, 29 December 1791, ''HRNSW'', Vol.I, Part II, page 575. </ref>  In June 1793, Earl Fitzwilliam offered him a lifeline, he appointed his London lawyer, Charles Cookney, Wentworth's agent, making it possible for him to become an early trader in the Colony<ref>Earl Fitzwilliam to D'Arcy Wentworth, 24 June 1793. ''Wentworth Woodhouse Muniments,'' Sheffield.</ref>  \n\n== Public Life ==\nDuring his thirty-seven years in New South Wales, D'Arcy Wentworth served under the first seven governors of the Colony.\n\n===Governor Arthur Phillip, RN, 12 October 1786 to 10 December 1792===\n[[Arthur Phillip]], the first Governor of New South Wales, returned to England in 1792, after five years in the Colony. He applied for leave in April 1790, and again in March and November 1791, but received no response from London. Weak, ill, and in constant pain, the Governor made his own arrangements. He delegated Major [[Francis Grose]], senior officer of the [[New South Wales Corps]], to act as administrator in his absence, and on 11 December 1792 he left Sydney Town on the ''Atlantic.'' Two Aboriginal men, [[Bennelong]] and Imeeranwanyee, who had befriended and assisted him during the first years of the settlement, accompanied him to England.\n\n===Governor John Hunter, RN, 6 February 1794 to 27 December 1800===\nPhillip\u2019s successor, Captain [[John Hunter]], was appointed in February 1794. He had been Phillip\u2019s second in command, the captain of ''[[HMS Sirius (1786)|HMS Sirius]]'' that had provided a naval escort for the [[First Fleet]]. He was to return to the Colony on ''[[HMS Reliance]]'', but after she was thrown ashore at Plymouth in wild weather, it was another year before he sailed. After an anxious voyage through French infested waters, Governor [[Hunter]] arrived in Sydney on 7 September 1795, nearly three years after Phillip\u2019s departure.\n \nIn that time, Major [[Grose]] had placed the Colony under military rule. He had abolished the Courts, made generous land grants to his officers and provided them with convict labour, fed and clothed at Government expense. Food produced on their farms could be sold profitably to the Government Stores. Under [[Arthur Phillip|Phillip]] rationing had applied to everyone, including the Governor. After a poor harvest in 1793, [[Grose]] decreased food rations for the convicts but not for the military. \n\n[[Arthur Phillip|Phillip]] had not permitted the military to import spirits or goods to trade. Neither [[Grose]] nor [[William Paterson]], who succeeded him in December 1794, imposed such restrictions. Groups of officers chartered ships to deliver alcohol and tradeable goods to the Colony, the scarce coinage was replaced by rum, it became the Colony\u2019s currency, used to pay for labour, food and other necessities. The [[New South Wales Corps]] became known as the ''Rum Corps''. When [[Hunter]] arrived in late 1795, he found the Colony completely altered, rife with drunkenness and crime. The populace, subject to the whims of the Rum Corps, was riven with divisions and hostilities. \n\nUnder [[Grose]], the Rum Corps officers controlled the prices of all imported commodities, their monopoly over trading reaped enormous profits. Emancipated convicts, no longer on Government rations, were unable to pay for necessities. If they provided labour to officers or wealthy settlers, they were exploited for negligible reward. Many went into debt or bankruptcy, abandoned their land grants or sold them cheaply to the officers and crowded back into Sydney Town to live or to await an opportunity to join a ship going home.\n\nGovernor Hunter gave D\u2019Arcy Wentworth permission to leave Norfolk Island, and he arrived back in Sydney on 5 March 1796. He had worked without a break for six years on the island. He received \u00a340 a year as Superintendent of Convicts, but had not been paid for his work as Assistant Surgeon. His applications for leave and requests for his position to be regularized had been ignored. In London, Earl Fitzwilliam pursued the matter of payment for his service as Assistant Surgeon, and in 1798, as a result of his efforts, Wentworth was paid arrears of \u00a3160, for six years work.<ref>Charles Cookney to D\u2019Arcy Wentworth, 1798, \"Wentworth Papers\", Mitchell Library, Sydney.</ref>\n\nSoon after Wentworth\u2019s return, Governor [[Hunter]] appointed him to Sydney Cove Hospital as an Assistant Surgeon, replacing Samuel Leeds, who disqualified himself though drunkenness. In Sydney, [[Hunter]] allowed several people including Wentworth, to act as traders, in an attempt to break the power of the Rum Corps officers through competition, and lower the price of commodities. On 11 May 1799, he appointed Wentworth Assistant Surgeon at Parramatta, in charge of the hospital there, replacing James Mileham, later court martialled for refusing to attend the settlers, free people, and others. <ref>Thomas Jamison, Principal Surgeon, to Earl Camden, 20 July 1805.

Wentworth planted a dozen young Norfolk Island pines along the ridge line, and built a comfortable two storey house he named ''Wentworth Woodhouse''. John Price, surgeon on the ''Minerva,'' visited him there, he described it as ''charmingly situated and, as Milton says, \"Bosomed high in tufted trees\".'' <ref> John Washington Price, op cit. Price was quoting from John Milton\u2019s ''L\u2019Allegro'':''Towers & battlements it sees, bosom\u2019d high in tufted trees.''</ref>  \n\n===Governor Philip Gidley King, RN, 28 September 1800 to 12 August 1806===\nWentworth had been friendly with [[Philip Gidley King]] on [[Norfolk Island]]. On 15 April 1800, King returned to Sydney from London with a dormant commission, to act as governor in the case of the death or during the absence of Captain [[John Hunter]].<ref>Dublin Post, 27 January 1798.</ref> During Governor Hunter\u2019s final five months in the Colony, Wentworth provided friendship, assistance and undivided loyalty. His support rankled King. When he took over as governor, King curtailed D\u2019Arcy Wentworth\u2019s trading, he impounded his trading stock and sent him back to [[Norfolk Island]]. John Grant, an emancipist, commented, ''Governor King hates Hunter\u2019s friends.''<ref>John Grant to his mother and sister, 13 July 1804, John Grant Papers, NLA.</ref>\n \n===Captain William Bligh, RN, 13 August 1806 to 26 January 1808===\nCaptain [[William Bligh]], who succeeded King, had D\u2019Arcy Wentworth court martialled for disrespect, the result of conflicting instructions given by the Governor.  As a consequence of Bligh\u2019s belligerence, Wentworth supported Major [[George Johnston]] and [[John Macarthur]] in the [[Rum Rebellion]] on 26 January 1808, that overthrew the Governor and placed him under house arrest.\n \n===Major-General Lachlan Macquarie, CB, 1 January 1810 to 1 December 1821===\n[[Lachlan Macquarie]] came ashore in Sydney on 1 January 1810. On 7 January he issued a Government and General Order declaring all official appointments made since Bligh\u2019s arrest null and void. On 20 February 1810, he ordered that D\u2019Arcy Wentworth remain as Principal Surgeon, pending instructions from London. Macquarie recommended his appointment in his first despatch: ''Mr Wentworth is a gentleman of considerable professional abilities, extremely attentive and humane in his attendance and practice, and in every respect well qualified for being placed at the head of the medical department here.''<ref> Governor Macquarie to Viscount Castlereagh, 8 March 1810, ''HRA'', Series I, Vol. VII, page 306.</ref> \n\nUnder Governor Macquarie, D\u2019Arcy Wentworth found great recognition. From the outset Macquarie respected his judgement, he placed new and heavy responsibilities on his shoulders, and Wentworth responded with absolute loyalty and diligence. Macquarie found him ''indefagitable in his Exertions and Assiduity''.<ref> Governor Macquarie to Earl Liverpool, 18 October 1811, ''HRNSW'', Vol. VII, page 600.</ref>  The two men, both over six feet tall, were the same age, forty-seven, born a fortnight apart in 1762. They shared their generation\u2019s belief in the principles of the Enlightenment. They recognized that reason, science, and an exchange of ideas, knowledge and experience were necessary to progress the Colony and to achieve Macquarie\u2019s vision for a more harmonious and inclusive society.\n\nOn 31 March 1810, Macquarie appointed D\u2019Arcy Wentworth, Treasurer of the Colonial Police Fund, the consolidated revenue fund of the Colony. He was effectively the Treasurer of the Colony, responsible for receiving revenue raised within the Colony from government activities, including three-quarters of all customs duties, fees collected at the port and town of Sydney, licensing fees from markets, inns, hotels and breweries, and the licences recently issued to publicans for vending spirituous liquors.<ref>Government and General Order, ''Sydney Gazette'', 31 March 1810.</ref> Macquarie ordered the Fund was to be used for: ''All Gaol and Police Expenses of every description shall be defrayed, together with such other Expended as may be necessarily incurred in ornamenting and improving the Town of Sydney, and in constructing and repairing the Quays, Wharfs, Bridges, Streets and Roads.''<ref>Governor Macquarie to Viscount Castlereagh, 30 April 1810, ''HRA'', Series I, Vol. VII, page 354.</ref> Wentworth submitted quarterly accounts to the Governor for his approval, that were published in the ''Sydney Gazette''.\n\nOn 7 April 1810, Macquarie made Wentworth a Commissioner of the new turnpike road to be built from Sydney to Parramatta and the Hawkesbury.<ref>''Sydney Gazette'', 7 April 1810</ref> On 17 May 1810, the Governor appointed Wentworth one of two Justices of the Peace.<ref>''Sydney Gazette'', 19 May 1810.</ref> On 11 August 1810, D\u2019Arcy Wentworth was made a member of the Court of Civil Jurisdiction.<ref>Sydney Gazette, 11 August 1810.</ref>\n\nOn 6 October 1810, Macquarie announced Sydney was to have a single effective police force. He appointed D\u2019Arcy Wentworth Chief Magistrate and Superintendent of Police,<ref>''Sydney Gazette'', 29 December 1810,</ref> informing Lord Liverpool: ''I found the police of the town of Sydney very defective and totally inadequate to the preserving of peace and good order in this populous and extensive town. Under the Appellation of Superintendent of the Police at Sydney, I have appointed Mr D\u2019Arcy Wentworth, the present Acting Principal Surgeon, whose long residence in the Country gave him so full a Knowledge of the Persons and Characters of the Inhabitants as rendered him particularly well qualified for the Situation\u2026He has merited my fullest Approbation and that of the Public''.<ref>Governor Macquarie to Lord Liverpool, 18 October 1811, ''HRA'', Series I, Vol. VII, page 386.</ref>\n\nIn 1814, Macquarie set up the ''Native Institute for the Education of Indigenous Children'', and appointed D\u2019Arcy Wentworth to the committee of management.<ref>Government and General Order, ''Sydney Gazette'', Saturday, 24 December 1814.</ref> Wentworth had the respect and trust of the Aboriginal people in Sydney, they could take their grievances to him as Police Magistrate and could look to him for support and redress. Peter Cunningham, a Scot who made four trips to the Colony as ship\u2019s surgeon, before settling in the Hunter Valley, observed: ''all the Natives around Sydney understand English well, & speak it too, so as to be understood by the residents. The Billingsgate slang they certainly have acquired in perfection, & no white need think of competing with them in abuse or hard swearing, a constant torrent of which flows from their mouths as long as their antagonist remains before them; it is no use for him to reply, his words being quickly drowned in the roar of cursings & contemptuous appellations. I have stood for a considerable time witnessing contests of this kind, our Native satyrs invariably forcing their opponents to retrograde, while the instant blacky perceived whity beating a retreat, he vociferates after him\u2014\u201cGo along you dam rascal; go along you dam scoundrel; go along you dam blackguard\u201d exalting his voice as the enemy retires. But should this volley of abuse provoke \u201cwhite fellow\u201d to run up and threaten to strike him, \u201cblacky\u201d would dare him to the scratch, threaten him with Jail & Massa Wenta'', (D\u2019Arcy Wentworth) ''if he attempted it''.<ref>Peter Cunningham, ''Two Years in New South Wales,'' Angus and Robertson, Sydney, 1827, Vol. 1, page 21.</ref>\n\n====The Rum Hospital====\nOne of Wentworth\u2019s achievements was the construction of new hospital for Sydney. In 1806, Governor Bligh reported the wooden hospital at Dawes Point, that arrived on the Second Fleet, was ''rotten and decayed, not worth rep\u2019g'', and the other hospitals were in ''a ruinous state''.<ref>Governor Bligh to William Windham, 25 January 1807, ''HRA'', Series I, Vol.VI, page 99.</ref> \nMacquarie confirmed this in his first despatch to London: ''there will be an absolute necessity for building a new general hospital as soon as possible''. It was necessary to provide ''a proper place of reception, and more secure detention of the sick, and of moving it to a more airy and retired situation in the town''.<ref>Governor Macquarie to Viscount Castlereagh, 8 March 1810, ''HRNSW'', Vol.VI, page 99</ref> Without waiting for a reply, within two months the Governor had called for tenders.<ref>Bigge Report, Vol. III, page 105.</ref>\n \nMacquarie signed the contract for construction of a new hospital on 6 November 1810, with a consortium of businessmen\u2013Garnham Blaxcell and Alexander Riley, later joined by D'Arcy Wentworth. They would receive convict labour and a monopoly on rum imports, from which they expected to recoup the cost of the building and gain considerable profits. The contract allowed them an exclusive right to import 45,000 (later increased to 60,000) gallons of rum to sell, with the excise collected, paid into the Colonial Fund. Their projected profit on the building of the hospital did not eventuate, as a result of many unforeseen problems and the cost of the remedial work required. On its completion in 1816, convict patients were transferred to the new hospital, known as the \"Rum Hospital\".<ref>''HRA'' Series 1, Vol. VI. page 99, and Vol. VII, pages 306 & 596. Bigge Report Vol. III, page 105</ref>.\n   \n====Bank of New South Wales====\nThe Colony of New South Wales was established without any cash. Coinage brought to the Colony leaked out rapidly, mainly on ships that called with necessities, clothes, food, and knick knacks. As a result there was insufficient coinage to permit normal business transactions, forcing the Colony to rely on local paper currency and rum.\n \nOn 30 April 1810, Macquarie wrote to Lord Castlereagh: ''there is one circumstance to which I beg your Lordship\u2019s most serious attention, as on it seems to hinge much of the future prosperity of this colony. In consequence of there being neither gold nor silver coins of any denomination, nor any legal currency, as a substitute for specie in the colony, the people have been in some degree forced on the expedient of issuing and receiving notes of hand to supply the place of real money, and this petty banking has thrown open a door to frauds and impositions of a most grievous nature to the country at large\u2026At present the agricultural and commercial pursuits of the territory are very much impeded and obstructed by the want of some adequately secured circulating medium''.<ref>Governor Macquarie to Viscount Castlereagh, 30 April 1810, ''HRNSW'', Vol.VII, page 348</ref>.\n\nUnder D\u2019Arcy Wentworth, the Colonial Fund had a quasi-bank role, printing promissary notes and issuing them as currency, to people who had claims on the Fund. Wentworth had the ''Sydney Gazette'' print books of notes, labelled Police Fund, with four different Sterling values: two shillings and sixpence, five shillings, ten shillings and one pound. To protect against forgery, he had a Latin quotation from Cicero with a decorative border printed on the reverse side, and he signed each note. They circulated throughout the Colony, helping to overcome the shortage of small change.\n\nThe idea of establishing a bank was raised in March 1810, but it wasn't until November 1816 that a meeting was held to discuss the proposal. In February 1817, the Bank of New South Wales was established, Macquarie gave it a Charter as a joint stock company, providing its directors with limited liability. The first directors were: D'Arcy Wentworth, John Harris, Robert Jenkins, Thomas Wylde, Alexander Riley, William Redfern and John Thomas Campbell. Campbell, Macquarie\u2019s secretary, was elected the bank's first president, D\u2019Arcy Wentworth was elected president in 1825.<ref>Reginald Frank Holder, Bank of New South Wales : a history, 1 (1817-1893), 1970, Angus and Robertson, Sydney. ISBN 978-0-207-95362-0</ref> The new bank facilitated financial transactions and encouraged commerce, it helped bring to an end the Colony\u2019s dependence on rum as money, and the need for dubious promissary notes. The bank received deposits from the Colonial Fund, previously held by Wentworth.\n\n==== Macquarie and the Emancipists====\nIn his third despatch to London, written on Easter Monday 1810, Macquarie reported on what he observed as the Colony\u2019s most pressing problem: ''I was very much surprised and Concerned, on my Arrival here, at the extraordinary and illiberal Policy I found had been adopted by all the Persons who had preceded me in Office, respecting those Men who had been originally sent out to this Country as Convicts, but who, by long Habits of Industry and total Reformation of Manners, had not only become respectable, but by Many Degrees the most Useful Members of the Community. Those persons have never been Countenanced or received into Society.''\n\n''I have nevertheless, taken upon my self to adopt a new Line of Conduct, Conceiving that Emancipation, when united with Rectitude and long-tried good Conduct, should lead a Man back to that Rank in Society which he had forfeited, and do away, in as far as the Case will admit, All Retrospect of former bad Conduct. This appears to me to be the greatest inducement that Can be held out towards the Reformation of Manners of the establishment, and I think it is Consistent with the gracious and humane Intentions of His Majesty and His Ministers.''<ref>Governor Macquarie to Viscount Castlereagh, 30 April 1810, HRNSW, Vol.VII, page 348.</ref>\n\nMacquarie welcomed the emancipists into society, he appointed them to positions in the public sector, reversing the previous policy towards former convicts. Most likely D\u2019Arcy Wentworth had advocated on their behalf, for Macquarie had assumed he was an emancipist. He listed for Castlereagh the men who gave the most liberal assistance to government and conducted themselves with the greatest propriety, whom he had: admitted to my table, ''namely Mr D\u2019Arcy Wentworth, principal Surgeon; Mr William Redfern, Assistant Surgeon; Mr Andrew Thompson, an opulent Farmer and Proprietor of Land; and Mr Simeon Lord, an opulent Merchant.''<ref> Governor Macquarie to Viscount Castlereagh, 30 April 1810, HRNSW, Vol.VII, page 348.</ref> On 26 July 1811, Lord Liverpool acknowledged the principles Macquarie had outlined.\n\nThe Governor resolutely pursued his new Line of Conduct, championing emancipists of good conduct, raising them into key positions of authority and to a new rank in society. His approach startled and dismayed the Exclusives and wealthier free settlers, and met immediate opposition within the barracks, from the officers of the 73rd Regiment, sent to the Colony to replace the discredited Rum Corps.\nThe most vigorous opponents of the Governor\u2019s new inclusiveness were the clergy and judiciary of the Colony. They worked to frustrate and denigrate his progress, and complained noisily to London. The petitioned Members of Parliament, the Colonial Office and influential spokesmen within their own hierarchies, belaboring them with an increasing stream of grievances and gossip. D\u2019Arcy, working close to Macquarie, became an easy target for much of the venom directed towards the Governor.\n\nIn London, Opposition support for their campaign spurred the Secretary of State, Earl Bathurst, to propose in April 1817: ''the appointment of commissioners who shall forthwith proceed to the settlement with full powers to investigate all the complaints which have been made, both with respect to the treatment of convicts, and the general administration of the government.''<ref>Earl Bathurst to Viscount Sidmouth, 23 April 1817, HRA, Series I, Vol. IX, page 727.</ref>\n\n====John Thomas Bigge & his Report====\nNearly two years later, on 19 January 1819, John Thomas Bigge was appointed Commissioner of Inquiry, with a private instruction from Bathurst to end Macquarie\u2019s dream of an inclusive society in the Colony. <ref>(Earl Bathurst to Commissioner Bigge, 6 January 1819. ''HRA'', Series I, Vol. X, page 2.</ref> \n\nBigge did not attack Macquarie directly in his report, tabled in Parliament in 1822 and 1823, though he maligned him to the authorities in London. In his attempt to discredit Macquarie, Bigge\u2019s report took aim at those closest to the Governor. He attacked D\u2019Arcy Wentworth in particular, personally and professionally, and others who supported Macquarie\u2019s policy of a more inclusive society, including William Redfern and J.T. Campbell, the Governor\u2019s Secretary. \n\nIn May 1818, D\u2019Arcy Wentworth submitted his resignation as Principal Surgeon. Macquarie recommended that William Redfern, his Assistant Surgeon, an emancipist, replace him. Bigge opposed his appointment. On 23 October 1819, three weeks after James Bowman, Wentworth's replacement, arrived with Commissioner Bigge, Wentworth retired as Principal Surgeon. He had served 29 years as a surgeon in New South Wales, ten of those as Principal Surgeon. The Government and General Order announcing his retirement included a note from the Governor:''His Excellency would be doing Injustice to his own Feelings as well as to the Merits of Mr Wentworth, were he not to express an entire Satisfaction at, and unqualified Approbation of, the able, zealous, humane and intelligent Manner in which he has uniformly conducted the Duties of Principal Surgeon; and which His Excellency is happy to bear Testimony, were also conducted with the strictest Honour and Integrity. And whilst His Excellency regrets the Retirement of so able and useful a Medical Officer, he doubts not that the numerous and humane and charitable Acts which have so eminently distinguished his Professional Character during a long Course of Years will afford him a constant Source of the most consolatory and gratifying Reflections on every Retrospect of his active and important Public Service''.<ref>Government & General Order, 23 October 1819.</ref>\n\nIn March 1820, Wentworth resigned as Superintendent of Police, and received another public acknowledgement from Macquarie: ''In receiving Mr Wentworth\u2019s resignation of the office of Superintendent of Police, which he has filled for nearly ten years past with equal credit to himself and benefit to the community, his Excellency feels it due to that Gentleman to express in this public manner his unqualified approbation his steady, upright, able and impartial conduct in the discharge of its arduous and important duties''.<ref>Government and General Order 31 March 1820, ''Sydney Gazette'', 1 April 1820</ref>.  \nSix months later, when Wentworth resigned as Treasurer of the Police Fund, Macquarie made a further ''public Testimony of Approbation of his honourable, zealous, and punctual discharge of the important Trust which has been confided to him for upwards of ten Years past as Treasurer of the Police Fund''.<ref>Government and General Order 3 June 1820, ''Sydney Gazette'', 3 June 1820</ref>. In he Report, Bigge  referred to <ref>''the punctuality and credit with which Mr Wentworth acquitted himself in the discharge of his duty as Treasurer''</ref>.\n\nA few months later, on 26 March 1821, Wentworth\u2019s replacement William Minchin died, and Macquarie persuaded him to return as Superintendent of Police and Treasurer of the Colonial Revenue. He wrote to Earl  Bathurst, ''there was no-one else in the Colony capable of performing the duties''<ref>Governor Macquarie to Earl Bathurst, 21 July 1821, ''HRA'', Series I, Vol. X, page 532.</ref>. D\u2019Arcy agreed to his request, and on 21 July 1821, his return was greeted with wide acclaim<ref>D\u2019Arcy Wentworth to Charles Cookney, 22 July 1821, Wentworth Papers, ML.</ref>.\n\nOn 31 January 1822, his sixtieth birthday, Macquarie invited D\u2019Arcy and other close friends to celebrate. At day break on 12 February 1822, with his wife Elizabeth and son Lachlan, he passed through an ''immense concourse'' to the harbour, filled with ''a great gathering of launches, barges, cutters, pinnaces and wherries'', and went aboard the ''Surry'', for the voyage home. ''The Surry was towed slowly through the ships in the cove, which were all manned with colours displayed, and many of them saluting in honour of the occasion, the Battery saluting at the same time with 19 guns. The New Fort (named Fort Macquarie) and all the Rocks on Bennelong Point, as well as the Dawes Battery and the Rocks on the Northern side of the Harbour were covered with men, women and children and a vast number of boats were also sailing or rowing in the Harbour, full of People \u2013 cheering us repeatedly as we passed along through them.''<ref>Lachlan Macquarie, ''Journals''.</ref>\nThe ''Gazette'' reported: ''never did Sydney look so attractive and gay. The shores were lined with spectators, innumerable, but on each countenance was an indication of feeling too big, too sincere for utterance''<ref>''Sydney Gazette'\", 15 February 1822.</ref>.\n\n===Major-General Sir Thomas Brisbane, CB, 1 December 1821 to 1 December 1825===\n \n \n \n\n\n\nWentworth had several children by several local women; he acknowledged [[William Wentworth|William Charles Wentworth]] as his eldest son.  According to Ritchie (page 23), Wentworth did not board the ''Neptune'' until mid-December 1789 when he met for the first time Catherine Crowley, who was already on board.  Catherine gave birth to William on 13 August 1790, barely eight months later (Ritchie page 52).  Ritchie on page 53 noted that the baby was at least five weeks premature and had to struggle for his life.  Wentworth, who had assisted at the birth, appeared to have no doubt that the baby was his. A second child, [[D'Arcy Wentworth, Jr.|Dorset Crowley]], was born in 1793.\n\nIn 1799, Wentworth was appointed surgeon at Parramatta. He leased land in the vicinity of D\u2019Arcy Street in [[Parramatta]], before 6 acres were granted to him. He was later granted twelve acres in 1810.<ref name=parracouncil>{{cite web|url=http://arc.parracity.nsw.gov.au/city-of-parramatta-wards/origins-of-parramatta-street-names/|title=Parramatta Central Business District (CBD) Street Names|website=City of Parramatta Council Research Services|accessdate=24 May 2019|date=April 2019}}</ref>\n\nWentworth was granted 3.73&nbsp;km\u00b2 of land in what is now known as north [[Homebush, New South Wales|Homebush]], part of the [[Strathfield|Strathfield municipality]].  Historian Michael Jones says that \"Wentworth is popularly credited with having called the area after his 'home in the bush', although Homebush is also a place in Kent.\" In about 1807, he sold to Gregory Blaxland {{convert|450|acre|ha}} at the Brush Farm (near [[Eastwood, New South Wales|Eastwood]]) for \u00a31500. In Homebush he was put in charge of the police force and in 1810 became the commissioner of a toll road from Sydney to Parramatta.\n\nAround 1808, Wentworth played a significant role in the [[Rum Rebellion]] against Governor [[William Bligh]]. The participants in the rebellion claimed that Bligh had suspended Wentworth from his role as assistant surgeon on the staff, without reason or justice.\n\nIn 1810 Wentworth with two others was given by Governor [[Lachlan Macquarie]] a licence to import large quantities of [[rum]] on condition that they built a hospital to cater for up to two hundred patients. The original [[Sydney Hospital]] was in [[The Rocks, New South Wales|the Rocks]], but the one covered by the contract was in [[Macquarie Street, Sydney|Macquarie Street]]. What was the original Sydney Hospital in Macquarie Street became in 1854 the [[Sydney branch of the Royal Mint]]. Wentworth was one of the original shareholders and directors of the [[Bank of New South Wales]] (now Westpac Banking Corporation) formed at the end of 1816. \n \nWentworth built his home in the relatively secluded settlement he had been apportioned. By the time of his death Wentworth had accumulated 543.2&nbsp;km\u00b2 of land and had built a large family home. He died in 1827 and his property was inherited by his acknowledged son, William Charles Wentworth. His funeral procession, which started at Homebush and ended at Parramatta, was attended by 150 mourners.\n\nAnother part of his property, nine portions of land around Sydney, were inherited under entail by his daughter Katherine. The lands came to be known as the Bassett-Darley Estate in acknowledgement of Katherine's two marriages, and became the subject of litigation and an Act of Parliament to remove the legal impediments to their sale.\n\n==Recognition==\nThe Sydney suburbs of [[Wentworthville]] and [[Wentworth Point, New South Wales|Wentworth Point]] are named after him. Darcy Street (formerly D'arcy Street), within [[Parramatta]], is also named after him.<ref name=parracouncil/> Woodhouse Lane, also within Parramatta, was named after his two story mansion known as \"Wentworth Woodhouse\", which was built in this area.{{fact|date=March 2020}}\n \nWal Walker, a descendant of Wentworth, argues that his ancestor was a lover of [[Jane Austen]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://janeanddarcy.com/ | title=Jane & D\u02bcArcy \u2013 the Secret Romance Revealed}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n===Citations===\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\n* Barker, Hedley Philip (1971), [http://archival.sl.nsw.gov.au/Details/archive/110356330 'D'Arcy Wentworth', with bibliography], unpublished thesis submitted for M.A., Department of History, [[University of New England (Australia)|University of New England]], Armidale, NSW.

He served under the first seven governors of the Colony, and from 1810 to 1821, he was ''great assistant'' to Governor [[Lachlan Macquarie]]. Wentworth led a campaign for the rights and recognition of [[Emancipist|emancipists]] and for [[trial by jury]].<ref>W.W.Walker, ''[[Jane & D'Arcy: Jane Austen & D'Arcy Wentworth]]'' Volume 2, ''[[Such Talent& Such Success]]'', Arcana Press, 2017, page 315</ref>\n\n== Early life ==\nD'Arcy Wentworth was born in [[Portadown]], [[County Armagh]], [[Ireland]], the sixth child and fourth son of Martha and D'Arcy Wentworth. His family had left Yorkshire for safe haven in Ireland after the execution of [[Thomas Wentworth, Earl of Strafford]], in 1641. In 1778, aged sixteen, D'Arcy was apprenticed to Alexander Patton, a surgeon-apothecary, in nearby [[Tandragee]]. In 1782, he joined the [[Ulster Volunteers]], one of the local regiments formed during the [[American War of Independence]], to defend Ireland against invasion from France. In May 1785, having completed a seven-year apprenticeship, D'Arcy left Ireland. He was seeking an appointment with the [[East India Company]], and as the training of Irish surgeons was not recognised in England, it was necessary to go to London to gain accreditation.\n\n== Life in England ==\nWentworth sailed on the mailboat from Donaghadee to Portpatrick in Scotland. First he went to South Yorkshire, as the guest of his cousin, [[William Wentworth-Fitzwilliam, 4th Earl Fitzwilliam]], at ''[[Wentworth Woodhouse]].'' It was the beginning os a lifelong friendship. Fitzwilliam gave D'Arcy encouragement and advice. He attended Whig party gatherings and race meetings at [[York]], [[Doncaster]] and [[Wakefield]] with Fitzwilliam, who introduced him to the societies of York and London, with their up and coming lawyers, young politicians and aspiring bureaucrats. \n\nOn 1 December 1785, Wentworth went before the Court of Examiners of the Company of Surgeons in London. He qualified as a ''Mate to Indiamen,'' eligible to work with the East India Companyonce he had twelve months practical experience ''walking the wards'' in one of London's large charity hospitals.<ref>Royal College of Surgeons, \"Company of Surgeons Examination Book 1745-1800, page 11.</ref> Wentworth accepted the invitation of [[Percivall Pott]],one of his examiners, to ''walk the wards'' of St Bartholomew's, Smithfield under his direction. He attended lectures by other prominent physicians such as [[John Hunter]],and dissections held in the Company of Surgeons' anatomy theatre at the Old Bailey.\n\nWentworth waited in vain for a position to become available in the [[East India Company]]. [[Warren Hastings]] had brought peace to India, and the Company had an over supply of surgeons. Wentworth supported himself in London by mastering the art of card playing, and gambling at card tables in several inns and coffee houses. He found that many of those who lost to him would simply refuse to pay.\n\nEventually, Wentworth pursued a number of prominent players who had defaulted on their debts. Chief Magistrate and novelist, [[Henry Fielding]], had described gambling as, ''the School in which most Highwaymen of great Eminence have been bred.'' <ref>Henry Fielding, \u201cAn Enquiry into the Causes of the Late Increase in Robbers\u201d, London, 1751, Part III.</ref> Wentworth was arraigned before the Courts four times for highway robbery, but never convicted. On each occasion his defaulter either failed to appear to prosecute him, found himself unable to positively identify D'Arcy Wentworth, or sought only to name and shame him. \n\nIn March 1787, Fitzwilliam's patronage secured him a direction from the Home Office, to leave without delay for [[Portsmouth]], where the [[First Fleet]] was making ready to sail to [[Botany Bay]]. He was to seek out [[John White]], Principal Surgeon, on the ''[[Charlotte]]'', who could advise him of any vacancies for assistant surgeons on the Fleet. D'Arcy learnt  that to become a naval surgeon he would require another accreditation from the Company of Surgeons. He returned to his studies, and on 5 July 1897, he appeared before the Court of Examiners once again and qualified as an Assistant Surgeon, Second Mate, Third Rate.<ref>Royal College of Surgeons, ''Company of Surgeons Examination Book 1745-1800'', page 22. The rate determined the class of vessel on which the Assistant Surgeon could serve, according to the number of her cannons.</ref>\n\n== Arrival in the Colony of New South Wales ==                                   \nOn 17 January 1790, Wentworth left England on the [[Second Fleet (Australia)|Second Fleet]] on board the ''[[Neptune (1780 ship)|Neptune]]'', the most notorious of the convict transports. The neglect and ill treatment of her convicts resulted in the deaths of one hundred and forty-seven men and eleven women, over 30% of the.convicts she transported. Wentworth was on board as a passenger, he had no influence, no position on the ship and no employment arranged in the Colony. He arrived in Sydney on 26 June 1790, he spent his first five weeks assisting the local surgeons to care for the newly arrived convicts. \n\nThe Colony was short of food, strict rationing had been in place for three months. Five weeks after the ''[[Neptune]]'' arrived, to avoid a worsening disaster, Governor [[Arthur Phillip]] sent nearly 200 convicts and their superintendents to [[Norfolk Island]] on the ''[[Surprize (1780 ship)|Surprize]]''. Wentworth was sent with them, ''to act as an assistant to the surgeon there, being reputed to have the necessary requisites for such a situation\".<ref>Captain David Collins, \"Diary\", 1 August 1780.</ref>\n\nWentworth went ashore on Norfolk Island on 16 August 1790. The Commandant, Lt. Governor [[Philip Gidley King]] appointed him as an unpaid Assistant Surgeon. On the island, he became a good friend of Captain [[John Hunter]], whose vessel, ''[[HMS Sirius (1786)|HMS Sirius]]'', was wrecked on a sunken reef off the island five months earlier. Hunter and most of his crew were stranded there for nearly a year, awaiting a vessel to return to Sydney. \n\nIn December 1791, King appointed Wentworth to a second, paid position on [[Norfolk Island]], as Superintendent of Convicts, responsible for overseeing up to 150 convict labourers on building projects, land clearing and farm work.<ref>Lieut. Governor King to Governor Phillip, 29 December 1791, ''HRNSW'', Vol.I, Part II, page 575. </ref>  In June 1793, Earl Fitzwilliam offered him a lifeline, he appointed his London lawyer, Charles Cookney, Wentworth's agent, making it possible for him to become an early trader in the Colony<ref>Earl Fitzwilliam to D'Arcy Wentworth, 24 June 1793. ''Wentworth Woodhouse Muniments,'' Sheffield.</ref>  \n\n== Public Life ==\nDuring his thirty-seven years in New South Wales, D'Arcy Wentworth served under the first seven governors of the Colony.\n\n===Governor Arthur Phillip, RN, 12 October 1786 to 10 December 1792===\n[[Arthur Phillip]], the first Governor of New South Wales, returned to England in 1792, after five years in the Colony. He applied for leave in April 1790, and again in March and November 1791, but received no response from London. Weak, ill, and in constant pain, the Governor made his own arrangements. He delegated Major [[Francis Grose]], senior officer of the [[New South Wales Corps]], to act as administrator in his absence, and on 11 December 1792 he left Sydney Town on the ''Atlantic.'' Two Aboriginal men, [[Bennelong]] and Imeeranwanyee, who had befriended and assisted him during the first years of the settlement, accompanied him to England.\n\n===Governor John Hunter, RN, 6 February 1794 to 27 December 1800===\nPhillip\u2019s successor, Captain [[John Hunter]], was appointed in February 1794. He had been Phillip\u2019s second in command, the captain of ''[[HMS Sirius (1786)|HMS Sirius]]'' that had provided a naval escort for the [[First Fleet]]. He was to return to the Colony on ''[[HMS Reliance]]'', but after she was thrown ashore at Plymouth in wild weather, it was another year before he sailed. After an anxious voyage through French infested waters, Governor [[Hunter]] arrived in Sydney on 7 September 1795, nearly three years after Phillip\u2019s departure.\n \nIn that time, Major [[Grose]] had placed the Colony under military rule. He had abolished the Courts, made generous land grants to his officers and provided them with convict labour, fed and clothed at Government expense. Food produced on their farms could be sold profitably to the Government Stores. Under [[Phillip]] rationing had applied to everyone, including the Governor. After a poor harvest in 1793, [[Grose]] decreased food rations for the convicts but not for the military. \n\n[[Phillip]] had not permitted the military to import spirits or goods to trade. Neither [[Grose]] nor [[William Paterson]], who succeeded him in December 1794, imposed such restrictions. Groups of officers chartered ships to deliver alcohol and tradeable goods to the Colony, the scarce coinage was replaced by rum, it became the Colony\u2019s currency, used to pay for labour, food and other necessities. The [[New South Wales Corps]] became known as the ''Rum Corps''. When [[Hunter]] arrived in late 1795, he found the Colony completely altered, rife with drunkenness and crime. The populace, subject to the whims of the Rum Corps, was riven with divisions and hostilities. \n\nUnder [[Grose]], the Rum Corps officers controlled the prices of all imported commodities, their monopoly over trading reaped enormous profits. Emancipated convicts, no longer on Government rations, were unable to pay for necessities. If they provided labour to officers or wealthy settlers, they were exploited for negligible reward. Many went into debt or bankruptcy, abandoned their land grants or sold them cheaply to the officers and crowded back into Sydney Town to live or to await an opportunity to join a ship going home.\n\nGovernor Hunter gave D\u2019Arcy Wentworth permission to leave Norfolk Island, and he arrived back in Sydney on 5 March 1796. He had worked without a break for six years on the island. He received \u00a340 a year as Superintendent of Convicts, but had not been paid for his work as Assistant Surgeon. His applications for leave and requests for his position to be regularized had been ignored. In London, Earl Fitzwilliam pursued the matter of payment for his service as Assistant Surgeon, and in 1798, as a result of his efforts, Wentworth was paid arrears of \u00a3160, for six years work.<ref>Charles Cookney to D\u2019Arcy Wentworth, 1798, \"Wentworth Papers\", Mitchell Library, Sydney.</ref>\n\nSoon after Wentworth\u2019s return, Governor [[Hunter]] appointed him to Sydney Cove Hospital as an Assistant Surgeon, replacing Samuel Leeds, who disqualified himself though drunkenness. In Sydney, [[Hunter]] allowed several people including Wentworth, to act as traders, in an attempt to break the power of the Rum Corps officers through competition, and lower the price of commodities. On 11 May 1799, he appointed Wentworth Assistant Surgeon at Parramatta, in charge of the hospital there, replacing James Mileham, later court martialled for refusing to attend the settlers, free people, and others. <ref>Thomas Jamison, Principal Surgeon, to Earl Camden, 20 July 1805. ''HRNSW'', Vol. V, page 667.</ref>\n\nD\u2019Arcy Wentworth took up duty at Parramatta Hospital, \u2018\u2019two long sheds, built in the form of a tent, and thatched\u2026capable of holding two hundred patients.\u2019\u2019<ref>Watkin Tench, A Complete Account of the Settlement of Port Jackson, Chapter XVI.</ref> ''It was large and clean with a large vegetable garden attached to it.''<ref>John Washington Price, ''Minerva Journal'', ed.

Wentworth planted a dozen young Norfolk Island pines along the ridge line, and built a comfortable two storey house he named ''Wentworth Woodhouse''. John Price, surgeon on the ''Minerva,'' visited him there, he described it as ''charmingly situated and, as Milton says, \"Bosomed high in tufted trees\".'' <ref> John Washington Price, op cit. Price was quoting from John Milton\u2019s ''L\u2019Allegro'':''Towers & battlements it sees, bosom\u2019d high in tufted trees.''</ref>  \n\n===Governor Philip Gidley King, RN, 28 September 1800 to 12 August 1806===\nWentworth had been friendly with [[Philip Gidley King]] on [[Norfolk Island]]. On 15 April 1800, King returned to Sydney from London with a dormant commission, to act as governor in the case of the death or during the absence of Captain [[John Hunter]].<ref>Dublin Post, 27 January 1798.</ref> During Governor Hunter\u2019s final five months in the Colony, Wentworth provided friendship, assistance and undivided loyalty. His support rankled King. When he took over as governor, King curtailed D\u2019Arcy Wentworth\u2019s trading, he impounded his trading stock and sent him back to [[Norfolk Island]]. John Grant, an emancipist, commented, ''Governor King hates Hunter\u2019s friends.''<ref>John Grant to his mother and sister, 13 July 1804, John Grant Papers, NLA.</ref>\n \n===Captain William Bligh, RN, 13 August 1806 to 26 January 1808===\nCaptain [[William Bligh]], who succeeded King, had D\u2019Arcy Wentworth court martialled for disrespect, the result of conflicting instructions given by the Governor.  As a consequence of Bligh\u2019s belligerence, Wentworth supported Major [[George Johnston]] and [[John Macarthur]] in the [[Rum Rebellion]] on 26 January 1808, that overthrew the Governor and placed him under house arrest.\n \n===Major-General Lachlan Macquarie, CB, 1 January 1810 to 1 December 1821===\n[[Lachlan Macquarie]] came ashore in Sydney on 1 January 1810. On 7 January he issued a Government and General Order declaring all official appointments made since Bligh\u2019s arrest null and void. On 20 February 1810, he ordered that D\u2019Arcy Wentworth remain as Principal Surgeon, pending instructions from London. Macquarie recommended his appointment in his first despatch: ''Mr Wentworth is a gentleman of considerable professional abilities, extremely attentive and humane in his attendance and practice, and in every respect well qualified for being placed at the head of the medical department here.''<ref> Governor Macquarie to Viscount Castlereagh, 8 March 1810, ''HRA'', Series I, Vol. VII, page 306.</ref> \n\nUnder Governor Macquarie, D\u2019Arcy Wentworth found great recognition. From the outset Macquarie respected his judgement, he placed new and heavy responsibilities on his shoulders, and Wentworth responded with absolute loyalty and diligence. Macquarie found him ''indefagitable in his Exertions and Assiduity''.<ref> Governor Macquarie to Earl Liverpool, 18 October 1811, ''HRNSW'', Vol. VII, page 600.</ref>  The two men, both over six feet tall, were the same age, forty-seven, born a fortnight apart in 1762. They shared their generation\u2019s belief in the principles of the Enlightenment. They recognized that reason, science, and an exchange of ideas, knowledge and experience were necessary to progress the Colony and to achieve Macquarie\u2019s vision for a more harmonious and inclusive society.\n\nOn 31 March 1810, Macquarie appointed D\u2019Arcy Wentworth, Treasurer of the Colonial Police Fund, the consolidated revenue fund of the Colony. He was effectively the Treasurer of the Colony, responsible for receiving revenue raised within the Colony from government activities, including three-quarters of all customs duties, fees collected at the port and town of Sydney, licensing fees from markets, inns, hotels and breweries, and the licences recently issued to publicans for vending spirituous liquors.<ref>Government and General Order, ''Sydney Gazette'', 31 March 1810.</ref> Macquarie ordered the Fund was to be used for: ''All Gaol and Police Expenses of every description shall be defrayed, together with such other Expended as may be necessarily incurred in ornamenting and improving the Town of Sydney, and in constructing and repairing the Quays, Wharfs, Bridges, Streets and Roads.''<ref>Governor Macquarie to Viscount Castlereagh, 30 April 1810, ''HRA'', Series I, Vol. VII, page 354.</ref> Wentworth submitted quarterly accounts to the Governor for his approval, that were published in the ''Sydney Gazette''.\n\nOn 7 April 1810, Macquarie made Wentworth a Commissioner of the new turnpike road to be built from Sydney to Parramatta and the Hawkesbury.<ref>''Sydney Gazette'', 7 April 1810</ref> On 17 May 1810, the Governor appointed Wentworth one of two Justices of the Peace.<ref>''Sydney Gazette'', 19 May 1810.</ref> On 11 August 1810, D\u2019Arcy Wentworth was made a member of the Court of Civil Jurisdiction.<ref>Sydney Gazette, 11 August 1810.</ref>\n\nOn 6 October 1810, Macquarie announced Sydney was to have a single effective police force. He appointed D\u2019Arcy Wentworth Chief Magistrate and Superintendent of Police,<ref>''Sydney Gazette'', 29 December 1810,</ref> informing Lord Liverpool: ''I found the police of the town of Sydney very defective and totally inadequate to the preserving of peace and good order in this populous and extensive town. Under the Appellation of Superintendent of the Police at Sydney, I have appointed Mr D\u2019Arcy Wentworth, the present Acting Principal Surgeon, whose long residence in the Country gave him so full a Knowledge of the Persons and Characters of the Inhabitants as rendered him particularly well qualified for the Situation\u2026He has merited my fullest Approbation and that of the Public''.<ref>Governor Macquarie to Lord Liverpool, 18 October 1811, ''HRA'', Series I, Vol. VII, page 386.</ref>\n\nIn 1814, Macquarie set up the ''Native Institute for the Education of Indigenous Children'', and appointed D\u2019Arcy Wentworth to the committee of management.<ref>Government and General Order, ''Sydney Gazette'', Saturday, 24 December 1814.</ref> Wentworth had the respect and trust of the Aboriginal people in Sydney, they could take their grievances to him as Police Magistrate and could look to him for support and redress. Peter Cunningham, a Scot who made four trips to the Colony as ship\u2019s surgeon, before settling in the Hunter Valley, observed: ''all the Natives around Sydney understand English well, & speak it too, so as to be understood by the residents. The Billingsgate slang they certainly have acquired in perfection, & no white need think of competing with them in abuse or hard swearing, a constant torrent of which flows from their mouths as long as their antagonist remains before them; it is no use for him to reply, his words being quickly drowned in the roar of cursings & contemptuous appellations. I have stood for a considerable time witnessing contests of this kind, our Native satyrs invariably forcing their opponents to retrograde, while the instant blacky perceived whity beating a retreat, he vociferates after him\u2014\u201cGo along you dam rascal; go along you dam scoundrel; go along you dam blackguard\u201d exalting his voice as the enemy retires. But should this volley of abuse provoke \u201cwhite fellow\u201d to run up and threaten to strike him, \u201cblacky\u201d would dare him to the scratch, threaten him with Jail & Massa Wenta'', (D\u2019Arcy Wentworth) ''if he attempted it''.<ref>Peter Cunningham, ''Two Years in New South Wales,'' Angus and Robertson, Sydney, 1827, Vol. 1, page 21.</ref>\n\n====The Rum Hospital====\nOne of Wentworth\u2019s achievements was the construction of new hospital for Sydney. In 1806, Governor Bligh reported the wooden hospital at Dawes Point, that arrived on the Second Fleet, was ''rotten and decayed, not worth rep\u2019g'', and the other hospitals were in ''a ruinous state''.<ref>Governor Bligh to William Windham, 25 January 1807, ''HRA'', Series I, Vol.VI, page 99.</ref> \nMacquarie confirmed this in his first despatch to London: ''there will be an absolute necessity for building a new general hospital as soon as possible''. It was necessary to provide ''a proper place of reception, and more secure detention of the sick, and of moving it to a more airy and retired situation in the town''.<ref>Governor Macquarie to Viscount Castlereagh, 8 March 1810, ''HRNSW'', Vol.VI, page 99</ref> Without waiting for a reply, within two months the Governor had called for tenders.<ref>Bigge Report, Vol. III, page 105.</ref>\n \nMacquarie signed the contract for construction of a new hospital on 6 November 1810, with a consortium of businessmen\u2013Garnham Blaxcell and Alexander Riley, later joined by D'Arcy Wentworth. They would receive convict labour and a monopoly on rum imports, from which they expected to recoup the cost of the building and gain considerable profits. The contract allowed them an exclusive right to import 45,000 (later increased to 60,000) gallons of rum to sell, with the excise collected, paid into the Colonial Fund. Their projected profit on the building of the hospital did not eventuate, as a result of many unforeseen problems and the cost of the remedial work required. On its completion in 1816, convict patients were transferred to the new hospital, known as the \"Rum Hospital\".<ref>''HRA'' Series 1, Vol. VI. page 99, and Vol. VII, pages 306 & 596. Bigge Report Vol. III, page 105</ref>.\n   \n====Bank of New South Wales====\nThe Colony of New South Wales was established without any cash. Coinage brought to the Colony leaked out rapidly, mainly on ships that called with necessities, clothes, food, and knick knacks. As a result there was insufficient coinage to permit normal business transactions, forcing the Colony to rely on local paper currency and rum.\n \nOn 30 April 1810, Macquarie wrote to Lord Castlereagh: ''there is one circumstance to which I beg your Lordship\u2019s most serious attention, as on it seems to hinge much of the future prosperity of this colony. In consequence of there being neither gold nor silver coins of any denomination, nor any legal currency, as a substitute for specie in the colony, the people have been in some degree forced on the expedient of issuing and receiving notes of hand to supply the place of real money, and this petty banking has thrown open a door to frauds and impositions of a most grievous nature to the country at large\u2026At present the agricultural and commercial pursuits of the territory are very much impeded and obstructed by the want of some adequately secured circulating medium''.<ref>Governor Macquarie to Viscount Castlereagh, 30 April 1810, ''HRNSW'', Vol.VII, page 348</ref>.\n\nUnder D\u2019Arcy Wentworth, the Colonial Fund had a quasi-bank role, printing promissary notes and issuing them as currency, to people who had claims on the Fund. Wentworth had the ''Sydney Gazette'' print books of notes, labelled Police Fund, with four different Sterling values: two shillings and sixpence, five shillings, ten shillings and one pound. To protect against forgery, he had a Latin quotation from Cicero with a decorative border printed on the reverse side, and he signed each note. They circulated throughout the Colony, helping to overcome the shortage of small change.\n\nThe idea of establishing a bank was raised in March 1810, but it wasn't until November 1816 that a meeting was held to discuss the proposal. In February 1817, the Bank of New South Wales was established, Macquarie gave it a Charter as a joint stock company, providing its directors with limited liability. The first directors were: D'Arcy Wentworth, John Harris, Robert Jenkins, Thomas Wylde, Alexander Riley, William Redfern and John Thomas Campbell. Campbell, Macquarie\u2019s secretary, was elected the bank's first president, D\u2019Arcy Wentworth was elected president in 1825.<ref>Reginald Frank Holder, Bank of New South Wales : a history, 1 (1817-1893), 1970, Angus and Robertson, Sydney. ISBN 978-0-207-95362-0</ref> The new bank facilitated financial transactions and encouraged commerce, it helped bring to an end the Colony\u2019s dependence on rum as money, and the need for dubious promissary notes. The bank received deposits from the Colonial Fund, previously held by Wentworth.\n\n==== Macquarie and the Emancipists====\nIn his third despatch to London, written on Easter Monday 1810, Macquarie reported on what he observed as the Colony\u2019s most pressing problem: ''I was very much surprised and Concerned, on my Arrival here, at the extraordinary and illiberal Policy I found had been adopted by all the Persons who had preceded me in Office, respecting those Men who had been originally sent out to this Country as Convicts, but who, by long Habits of Industry and total Reformation of Manners, had not only become respectable, but by Many Degrees the most Useful Members of the Community. Those persons have never been Countenanced or received into Society.''\n\n''I have nevertheless, taken upon my self to adopt a new Line of Conduct, Conceiving that Emancipation, when united with Rectitude and long-tried good Conduct, should lead a Man back to that Rank in Society which he had forfeited, and do away, in as far as the Case will admit, All Retrospect of former bad Conduct. This appears to me to be the greatest inducement that Can be held out towards the Reformation of Manners of the establishment, and I think it is Consistent with the gracious and humane Intentions of His Majesty and His Ministers.''<ref>Governor Macquarie to Viscount Castlereagh, 30 April 1810, HRNSW, Vol.VII, page 348.</ref>\n\nMacquarie welcomed the emancipists into society, he appointed them to positions in the public sector, reversing the previous policy towards former convicts. Most likely D\u2019Arcy Wentworth had advocated on their behalf, for Macquarie had assumed he was an emancipist. He listed for Castlereagh the men who gave the most liberal assistance to government and conducted themselves with the greatest propriety, whom he had: admitted to my table, ''namely Mr D\u2019Arcy Wentworth, principal Surgeon; Mr William Redfern, Assistant Surgeon; Mr Andrew Thompson, an opulent Farmer and Proprietor of Land; and Mr Simeon Lord, an opulent Merchant.''<ref> Governor Macquarie to Viscount Castlereagh, 30 April 1810, HRNSW, Vol.VII, page 348.</ref> On 26 July 1811, Lord Liverpool acknowledged the principles Macquarie had outlined.\n\nThe Governor resolutely pursued his new Line of Conduct, championing emancipists of good conduct, raising them into key positions of authority and to a new rank in society. His approach startled and dismayed the Exclusives and wealthier free settlers, and met immediate opposition within the barracks, from the officers of the 73rd Regiment, sent to the Colony to replace the discredited Rum Corps.\nThe most vigorous opponents of the Governor\u2019s new inclusiveness were the clergy and judiciary of the Colony. They worked to frustrate and denigrate his progress, and complained noisily to London. The petitioned Members of Parliament, the Colonial Office and influential spokesmen within their own hierarchies, belaboring them with an increasing stream of grievances and gossip. D\u2019Arcy, working close to Macquarie, became an easy target for much of the venom directed towards the Governor.\n\nIn London, Opposition support for their campaign spurred the Secretary of State, Earl Bathurst, to propose in April 1817: ''the appointment of commissioners who shall forthwith proceed to the settlement with full powers to investigate all the complaints which have been made, both with respect to the treatment of convicts, and the general administration of the government.''<ref>Earl Bathurst to Viscount Sidmouth, 23 April 1817, HRA, Series I, Vol. IX, page 727.</ref>\n\n====John Thomas Bigge & his Report====\nNearly two years later, on 19 January 1819, John Thomas Bigge was appointed Commissioner of Inquiry, with a private instruction from Bathurst to end Macquarie\u2019s dream of an inclusive society in the Colony. <ref>(Earl Bathurst to Commissioner Bigge, 6 January 1819. ''HRA'', Series I, Vol. X, page 2.</ref> \n\nBigge did not attack Macquarie directly in his report, tabled in Parliament in 1822 and 1823, though he maligned him to the authorities in London. In his attempt to discredit Macquarie, Bigge\u2019s report took aim at those closest to the Governor. He attacked D\u2019Arcy Wentworth in particular, personally and professionally, and others who supported Macquarie\u2019s policy of a more inclusive society, including William Redfern and J.T. Campbell, the Governor\u2019s Secretary. \n\nIn May 1818, D\u2019Arcy Wentworth submitted his resignation as Principal Surgeon. Macquarie recommended that William Redfern, his Assistant Surgeon, an emancipist, replace him. Bigge opposed his appointment. On 23 October 1819, three weeks after James Bowman, Wentworth's replacement, arrived with Commissioner Bigge, Wentworth retired as Principal Surgeon. He had served 29 years as a surgeon in New South Wales, ten of those as Principal Surgeon. The Government and General Order announcing his retirement included a note from the Governor:''His Excellency would be doing Injustice to his own Feelings as well as to the Merits of Mr Wentworth, were he not to express an entire Satisfaction at, and unqualified Approbation of, the able, zealous, humane and intelligent Manner in which he has uniformly conducted the Duties of Principal Surgeon; and which His Excellency is happy to bear Testimony, were also conducted with the strictest Honour and Integrity. And whilst His Excellency regrets the Retirement of so able and useful a Medical Officer, he doubts not that the numerous and humane and charitable Acts which have so eminently distinguished his Professional Character during a long Course of Years will afford him a constant Source of the most consolatory and gratifying Reflections on every Retrospect of his active and important Public Service''.<ref>Government & General Order, 23 October 1819.</ref>\n\nIn March 1820, Wentworth resigned as Superintendent of Police, and received another public acknowledgement from Macquarie: ''In receiving Mr Wentworth\u2019s resignation of the office of Superintendent of Police, which he has filled for nearly ten years past with equal credit to himself and benefit to the community, his Excellency feels it due to that Gentleman to express in this public manner his unqualified approbation his steady, upright, able and impartial conduct in the discharge of its arduous and important duties''.<ref>Government and General Order 31 March 1820, ''Sydney Gazette'', 1 April 1820</ref>.  \nSix months later, when Wentworth resigned as Treasurer of the Police Fund, Macquarie made a further ''public Testimony of Approbation of his honourable, zealous, and punctual discharge of the important Trust which has been confided to him for upwards of ten Years past as Treasurer of the Police Fund''.<ref>Government and General Order 3 June 1820, ''Sydney Gazette'', 3 June 1820</ref>. In he Report, Bigge  referred to <ref>''the punctuality and credit with which Mr Wentworth acquitted himself in the discharge of his duty as Treasurer''</ref>.\n\nA few months later, on 26 March 1821, Wentworth\u2019s replacement William Minchin died, and Macquarie persuaded him to return as Superintendent of Police and Treasurer of the Colonial Revenue. He wrote to Earl  Bathurst, ''there was no-one else in the Colony capable of performing the duties''<ref>Governor Macquarie to Earl Bathurst, 21 July 1821, ''HRA'', Series I, Vol. X, page 532.</ref>. D\u2019Arcy agreed to his request, and on 21 July 1821, his return was greeted with wide acclaim<ref>D\u2019Arcy Wentworth to Charles Cookney, 22 July 1821, Wentworth Papers, ML.</ref>.\n\nOn 31 January 1822, his sixtieth birthday, Macquarie invited D\u2019Arcy and other close friends to celebrate. At day break on 12 February 1822, with his wife Elizabeth and son Lachlan, he passed through an ''immense concourse'' to the harbour, filled with ''a great gathering of launches, barges, cutters, pinnaces and wherries'', and went aboard the ''Surry'', for the voyage home. ''The Surry was towed slowly through the ships in the cove, which were all manned with colours displayed, and many of them saluting in honour of the occasion, the Battery saluting at the same time with 19 guns. The New Fort (named Fort Macquarie) and all the Rocks on Bennelong Point, as well as the Dawes Battery and the Rocks on the Northern side of the Harbour were covered with men, women and children and a vast number of boats were also sailing or rowing in the Harbour, full of People \u2013 cheering us repeatedly as we passed along through them.''<ref>Lachlan Macquarie, ''Journals''.</ref>\nThe ''Gazette'' reported: ''never did Sydney look so attractive and gay. The shores were lined with spectators, innumerable, but on each countenance was an indication of feeling too big, too sincere for utterance''<ref>''Sydney Gazette'\", 15 February 1822.</ref>.\n\n===Major-General Sir Thomas Brisbane, CB, 1 December 1821 to 1 December 1825===\n \n \n \n\n\n\nWentworth had several children by several local women; he acknowledged [[William Wentworth|William Charles Wentworth]] as his eldest son.  According to Ritchie (page 23), Wentworth did not board the ''Neptune'' until mid-December 1789 when he met for the first time Catherine Crowley, who was already on board.  Catherine gave birth to William on 13 August 1790, barely eight months later (Ritchie page 52).  Ritchie on page 53 noted that the baby was at least five weeks premature and had to struggle for his life.  Wentworth, who had assisted at the birth, appeared to have no doubt that the baby was his. A second child, [[D'Arcy Wentworth, Jr.|Dorset Crowley]], was born in 1793.\n\nIn 1799, Wentworth was appointed surgeon at Parramatta. He leased land in the vicinity of D\u2019Arcy Street in [[Parramatta]], before 6 acres were granted to him. He was later granted twelve acres in 1810.<ref name=parracouncil>{{cite web|url=http://arc.parracity.nsw.gov.au/city-of-parramatta-wards/origins-of-parramatta-street-names/|title=Parramatta Central Business District (CBD) Street Names|website=City of Parramatta Council Research Services|accessdate=24 May 2019|date=April 2019}}</ref>\n\nWentworth was granted 3.73&nbsp;km\u00b2 of land in what is now known as north [[Homebush, New South Wales|Homebush]], part of the [[Strathfield|Strathfield municipality]].  Historian Michael Jones says that \"Wentworth is popularly credited with having called the area after his 'home in the bush', although Homebush is also a place in Kent.\" In about 1807, he sold to Gregory Blaxland {{convert|450|acre|ha}} at the Brush Farm (near [[Eastwood, New South Wales|Eastwood]]) for \u00a31500. In Homebush he was put in charge of the police force and in 1810 became the commissioner of a toll road from Sydney to Parramatta.\n\nAround 1808, Wentworth played a significant role in the [[Rum Rebellion]] against Governor [[William Bligh]]. The participants in the rebellion claimed that Bligh had suspended Wentworth from his role as assistant surgeon on the staff, without reason or justice.\n\nIn 1810 Wentworth with two others was given by Governor [[Lachlan Macquarie]] a licence to import large quantities of [[rum]] on condition that they built a hospital to cater for up to two hundred patients. The original [[Sydney Hospital]] was in [[The Rocks, New South Wales|the Rocks]], but the one covered by the contract was in [[Macquarie Street, Sydney|Macquarie Street]]. What was the original Sydney Hospital in Macquarie Street became in 1854 the [[Sydney branch of the Royal Mint]]. Wentworth was one of the original shareholders and directors of the [[Bank of New South Wales]] (now Westpac Banking Corporation) formed at the end of 1816. \n \nWentworth built his home in the relatively secluded settlement he had been apportioned. By the time of his death Wentworth had accumulated 543.2&nbsp;km\u00b2 of land and had built a large family home. He died in 1827 and his property was inherited by his acknowledged son, William Charles Wentworth. His funeral procession, which started at Homebush and ended at Parramatta, was attended by 150 mourners.\n\nAnother part of his property, nine portions of land around Sydney, were inherited under entail by his daughter Katherine. The lands came to be known as the Bassett-Darley Estate in acknowledgement of Katherine's two marriages, and became the subject of litigation and an Act of Parliament to remove the legal impediments to their sale.\n\n==Recognition==\nThe Sydney suburbs of [[Wentworthville]] and [[Wentworth Point, New South Wales|Wentworth Point]] are named after him. Darcy Street (formerly D'arcy Street), within [[Parramatta]], is also named after him.<ref name=parracouncil/> Woodhouse Lane, also within Parramatta, was named after his two story mansion known as \"Wentworth Woodhouse\", which was built in this area.{{fact|date=March 2020}}\n \nWal Walker, a descendant of Wentworth, argues that his ancestor was a lover of [[Jane Austen]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://janeanddarcy.com/ | title=Jane & D\u02bcArcy \u2013 the Secret Romance Revealed}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n===Citations===\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\n* Barker, Hedley Philip (1971), [http://archival.sl.nsw.gov.au/Details/archive/110356330 'D'Arcy Wentworth', with bibliography], unpublished thesis submitted for M.A., Department of History, [[University of New England (Australia)|University of New England]], Armidale, NSW.

For example, transfeminism stands in stark contrast to mainstream second-wave feminism. Transfeminists often criticize the ideas of a universal sisterhood, aligning more with [[intersectionality]] and with the mainstream third wave's appreciation for the diversity of women's experience.<ref name=\"Ms.\">{{cite web|url=http://msmagazine.com/blog/2012/04/18/trans-feminism-theres-no-conundrum-about-it/|title=Trans Feminism: There's No Conundrum About It|work=[[Ms. (magazine)|Ms.]]|last=Serano|first=Julia|date=April 18, 2012|accessdate=January 20, 2015}}</ref> Citing their common experience, many transfeminists directly challenge the idea that [[femininity]] is an entirely social construction. Instead, they view gender as a multifaceted set of diverse intrinsic and social qualities. For example, there are both trans and cis persons who express themselves in ways that differ from society\u2019s expectations of masculine and feminine.<ref name=\"Ms.\" /> Because this strongly affects how the person experiences and articulates their gender, and also their standing within patriarchy, these transfeminists would argue that masculine/feminine expression is an important concept worthy of feminist inquiry, to be compared and contrasted with both assigned sex and gender identity.\n\n'''Sisterhood'''\n\n\"Sisterhood\" is a primary term that separates transfeminism from mainstream second-wave feminism. According to critics, \"sisterhood\" as a term evokes the idea that patriarchy and its tactics are so universal that the most important experiences of women everywhere are equivalent.<!-- citation needed? --> However, women in culturally, ethnically, and/or economically diverse societies, young women and girls, women with disabilities, and others, object to the idea of universal sisterhood and its logical extensions, including two ideas: first, if one works for the benefit of any woman, one works for the benefit of all equally; second, that in a sexist society all women have the same (minimal) level of power.<ref>Brendy Lyshaug, Solidarity Without \"Sisterhood\"?

Transgender people are viewed as outlandish exceptions to society's norms. Thus when a person appears to fit within \u2013 or almost within \u2013 society's norms, one is assumed not to be transgender. When a person sees someone that isn't easily classified as a man or a woman, the viewer still almost never assumes the subject to be trans. For example, the \"Saturday Night Live\" sketch including a character called \"[[Pat (Saturday Night Live)|Pat]]\".<ref>See also: https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110169/</ref> The comedy is based on other characters' curiosity about Pat's gender. They ask leading yet socially acceptable questions whose answer might confirm Pat as a man or a woman. Invariably, Pat answers without doing so. Even after several rounds of such questioning, the characters never conclude that Pat is trans.<ref>\nCourvant, 2007</ref> Such are the rules of polite society: it would be rude to assume another person is trans. As this training is so deep (and it is impossible to perceive another's thoughts), it is not possible to notice each trans person one meets. Thus the idea that trans women are somehow more feminine is an unprovable assertion most often made by those who wish to malign trans women as uneducated, and unliberated, and who threaten to serve as a useful tool enabling anti-feminist movements.<ref name=serano/><ref name=\"Raymond 1994\" /><ref>\nSandy Stone at http://sandystone.com/empire-strikes-back</ref>\n\nFemininity in transgender women is noticed and punished much more harshly than the same behaviors in cisgender women{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Serano|first=Julia|date=2007|title=Trans-misogyny primer|url=https://www.juliaserano.com/av/TransmisogynyPrimer-Serano.pdf|journal=|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> This [[double standard]] reveals that the behavior itself is not as problematic to many critics as the existence of trans people.<ref name=\"Courvant 2002\"/><ref>{{Cite news|last=Valerio |first=Max Wolf |year=2002 |title=Now That You're a White Man}} In {{harvnb|Anzaldua|Keating|2002|pp=239\u2013254}}</ref> Julia Serano refers to the breed of misogyny experienced by trans women as '[[transmisogyny]]'.<ref name = \"serano\"/>\n\n====Womyn-born-womyn====\n[[Sheila Jeffreys]], a pronounced opponent of transfeminism and transgenderism in its entirety, supports a movement called \"Womyn-born-Womyn\".

For example, transfeminism stands in stark contrast to mainstream second-wave feminism.

Instead, they view gender as a multifaceted set of diverse intrinsic and social qualities. For example, there are both trans and cis persons who express themselves in ways that differ from society\u2019s expectations of masculine and feminine.<ref name=\"Ms.\" /> Because this strongly affects how the person experiences and articulates their gender, and also their standing within patriarchy, these transfeminists would argue that masculine/feminine expression is an important concept worthy of feminist inquiry, to be compared and contrasted with both assigned sex and gender identity.\n\n'''Sisterhood'''\n\n\"Sisterhood\" is a primary term that separates transfeminism from mainstream second-wave feminism. According to critics, \"sisterhood\" as a term evokes the idea that patriarchy and its tactics are so universal that the most important experiences of women everywhere are equivalent.<!-- citation needed? --> However, women in culturally, ethnically, and/or economically diverse societies, young women and girls, women with disabilities, and others, object to the idea of universal sisterhood and its logical extensions, including two ideas: first, if one works for the benefit of any woman, one works for the benefit of all equally; second, that in a sexist society all women have the same (minimal) level of power.<ref>Brendy Lyshaug, Solidarity Without \"Sisterhood\"?

Transgender people are viewed as outlandish exceptions to society's norms. Thus when a person appears to fit within \u2013 or almost within \u2013 society's norms, one is assumed not to be transgender. When a person sees someone that isn't easily classified as a man or a woman, the viewer still almost never assumes the subject to be trans. Take for example the \"Saturday Night Live\" character \"[[Pat (Saturday Night Live)|Pat]]\".<ref>See also: https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110169/</ref> The comedy is based on other characters' curiosity about Pat's gender. They ask leading yet socially acceptable questions whose answer might confirm Pat as a man or a woman. Invariably, Pat answers without doing so. Even after several rounds of such questioning, the characters never conclude that Pat is trans.<ref>\nCourvant, 2007</ref> Such are the rules of polite society: it would be rude to assume another person is trans. As this training is so deep (and it is impossible to perceive another's thoughts), it is not possible to notice each trans person one meets. Thus the idea that trans women are somehow more feminine is an unprovable assertion most often made by those who wish to malign trans women as uneducated, and unliberated, and who threaten to serve as a useful tool enabling anti-feminist movements.<ref name=serano/><ref name=\"Raymond 1994\" /><ref>\nSandy Stone at http://sandystone.com/empire-strikes-back</ref>\n\nFemininity in transgender women is noticed and punished much more harshly than the same behaviors in cisgender women{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Serano|first=Julia|date=2007|title=Trans-misogyny primer|url=https://www.juliaserano.com/av/TransmisogynyPrimer-Serano.pdf|journal=|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> This [[double standard]] reveals that the behavior itself is not as problematic to many critics as the existence of trans people.<ref name=\"Courvant 2002\"/><ref>{{Cite news|last=Valerio |first=Max Wolf |year=2002 |title=Now That You're a White Man}} In {{harvnb|Anzaldua|Keating|2002|pp=239\u2013254}}</ref> Julia Serano refers to the breed of misogyny experienced by trans women as '[[transmisogyny]]'.<ref name = \"serano\"/>\n\n====Womyn-born-womyn====\n[[Sheila Jeffreys]], a pronounced opponent of transfeminism and transgenderism in its entirety, supports a movement called \"Womyn-born-Womyn\".
