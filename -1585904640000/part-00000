In the new structure the companies operate more efficiently, which resulted in significant reduction of operating costs. This money can be redirected to development.\n\nIn 2013 [[Viktor Orb\u00e1n]]'s government started a program to lift Hungary's local governments out of debt. 100% of the debts of settlements whose population is under 5000 was repaid by the government. 60% of the debt of Budapest was repaid by the government. Later the remaining 40% was also repaid by the government, after the government decided to completely eliminate all debts of all local governments. In this year the national government accepted the request of the local government to finance the [http://www.bpcsatornazas.hu/ BKISZ project] from EU funds. This project builds the sewerage system in all parts of the city that did not have this infrastructure yet. Construction works will finish in Summer of 2015.

During this period Tarl\u00f3s lead the Commission for Strategic Planning of the Central-Hungarian Region and co-founded the Hungarian Society of Law-Enforcement-Science, the Baross G\u00e1bor Society and became a member of the Sz\u00e9chenyi Society.

Presley's involvement with the plight of Hungarian refugees fleeing from the effects of the 1956 Soviet invasion began on Sunday 28 October 1956, as some 56.7 million Americans watched Ed Sullivan's Sunday program at the CBS-TV network, which Presley was headlining for the second time. During that broadcast, a casual mention was made by Sullivan of the need to send aid to Hungarian refugees fleeing from the effects of the Soviet invasion. This led to Presley's official request, on his third and last appearance at Sullivan's Show and as a further 54.6 million viewers watched on 6 January 1957, for Mr. Sullivan, this time on his behalf, to request viewers to send their contributions. This was done by Mr. Sullivan himself with Presley off-camera as per the singer's request on two separate occasions during the broadcast and leading up to Presley's dedication of a song which, in his opinion, fit the mood properly as the  show's finale, namely the African American-written gospel song \"Peace in the Valley\". By the end of 1957,  these contributions, as handled by the Geneva-based International Red Cross, and which translated into perishables and non perishables, as well as food rations, clothing, and other essentials, had amounted to some CHF 26 million (US$6 million, in 1957 dollars) and the equivalent after inflation adjustments, of US$55.6 million in 2019 dollars.\n\n== Awards, prizes ==\n* Minor Cross of [[Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary]]\n* Officer's Cross of the [[Order of Merit of the Republic of Poland]] (2008)<ref>[http://isap.sejm.gov.pl/DetailsServlet?id=WMP20080840743]</ref>\n* Golden Degree of Szent Gell\u00e9rt Award\n* E\u00f6tv\u00f6s J\u00f3zsef Golden Medal\n* Henszlmann Imre Award\n* Remembrance Medal for Hungarian Urbanism\n* Grand Cross of Allegiance for Fatherland\n* Medal for Civil Organisations\n* Golden Seal-Ring Award of Mayors\n* Silver Medal of the Municipality of Sz\u00e9kelyudvarhely\n* Palatinus Medal of the Municipality of R\u00e9vkom\u00e1rom\n* '''Honored Citizen''', Budapest District III (from 2007)\n\n== Book ==\n* Tarl\u00f3s by K\u00e1roly Boros (Magyar H\u00e1z Kiad\u00f3, Budapest, 2007)\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20100313164136/http://www.tarlosistvan.hu/ Istv\u00e1n Tarl\u00f3s' Homepage]\n\n=== Interviews, debates ===\n* 3 January 2008 \u2013 [https://web.archive.org/web/20110718181315/http://www.hirado.hu/videotar/?id=15374 Criticizing the liberal Budapest-Policy], MTV Nap-Kelte\n* 3 January 2008 \u2013 [https://web.archive.org/web/20110721105112/http://www.echotv.hu/video/index.php?akt_menu=10&mm_id=32&media=2468&list=1)interj%C3%BA Without Taboos], Interview, [[Echo TV]]\n* 16 January 2008 \u2013 [https://web.archive.org/web/20110718181349/http://www.hirado.hu/cikk.php?id=254782 Debate, Istv\u00e1n Tarl\u00f3s and Ildik\u00f3 Lendvai (MSZP)], MTV Nagy K\u00e9rd\u00e9s\n\n=== Speeches ===\n* 17 August 2007 Civil Academy, [https://web.archive.org/web/20110721105700/http://www.echotv.hu/video/index.php?akt_menu=10&mm_id=24&media=1546&list=1) Speech of Istv\u00e1n Tarl\u00f3s], recorded by [[Echo TV]]\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-off}}\n{{Succession box\n| before = Imre Kiss\n| title  = [[\u00d3buda-B\u00e9k\u00e1smegyer|Mayor of \u00d3buda-B\u00e9k\u00e1smegyer]]\n| years = 1990&ndash;2006\n| after  = [[Bal\u00e1zs B\u00fas]]\n}}\n{{Succession box\n| before = [[G\u00e1bor Demszky]]\n| title  = [[Mayor of Budapest]]\n| years = 2010&ndash;2019\n| after  = [[Gergely Kar\u00e1csony]]\n}}\n{{s-end}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Tarlos, Istvan}}\n[[Category:1948 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:People from Budapest]]\n[[Category:Members of the National Assembly of Hungary (2010\u20132014)]]\n[[Category:Fidesz politicians]]\n[[Category:Alliance of Free Democrats politicians]]\n[[Category:Mayors of Budapest]]\n[[Category:Hungarian Roman Catholics]]\n[[Category:Recipients of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary]]\n", "text_old": "{{eastern name order|Tarl\u00f3s Istv\u00e1n}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2018}}\n{{Infobox officeholder\n| name            = Istv\u00e1n Tarl\u00f3s\n| image           = Tarl\u00f3sIstv\u00e1n (crop).jpg\n| image_size      = 260px\n| caption         = Istv\u00e1n Tarl\u00f3s in 2014\n| office          = [[Mayor of Budapest]]\n| term_start      = 3 October 2010\n| term_end        = 13 October 2019\n| president       = \n| predecessor     = [[G\u00e1bor Demszky]]\n| successor       = [[Gergely Kar\u00e1csony]]\n| office1         = [[Faction leader]] of Fidesz in Budapest\n| term_start1     = 1 October 2006\n| term_end1       = 3 October 2010\n| predecessor1    = [[Andr\u00e1s Kupper]]\n| successor1      = [[Zolt\u00e1n N\u00e9meth]]\n| office2         = [[\u00d3buda-B\u00e9k\u00e1smegyer|Mayor of \u00d3buda-B\u00e9k\u00e1smegyer]]<br /><small>Third district of Budapest</small>\n| term_start2     = 30 September 1990\n| term_end2       = 1 October 2006\n| president2      = \n| predecessor2    = Imre Kiss<br /><small>(Chairman of the Council)</small>\n| successor2      = [[Bal\u00e1zs B\u00fas]]\n| birth_date      = {{birth date and age|1948|5|26|df=y}}\n| birth_place     = [[Budapest]], [[Second Hungarian Republic|Hungary]]\n| spouse          = Cec\u00edlia Nagy {{small|(1973\u2013present)}}\n| children        = 2 daughters <br />1 son\n| alma_mater      = [[Budapest University of Technology and Economics]] <small>([[Master of Science|M.Sc]])</small>\n| profession      = [[Politician]], [[Engineer]]\n| religion        = [[Roman Catholicism]]\n| party           = Independent <small>(since 1994)</small>\n| otherparty      = [[Fidesz\u2013KDNP]] <small>(support in mayoral races)</small><br>[[Alliance of Free Democrats]] <small>(1989\u20131994)</small>\n| website         = {{URL|http://www.tarlosistvan.hu/|Personal website}}\n|}}\n\n'''Istv\u00e1n Tarl\u00f3s''' (pronounced {{IPA-hu|\u02c8i\u0283tva\u02d0n \u02c8t\u0252rlo\u02d0\u0283|}};

By September 2014 500 modern low-floor buses were bought, of which 300 were newly manufactured. This made it possible to scrap 500 of the oldest buses that were both in a bad state and polluted the environment too much.

Presley's involvement with the plight of Hungarian refugees fleeing from the effects of the 1956 Soviet invasion began on Sunday 28 October 1956, as some 56.7 million Americans watched Ed Sullivan's Sunday program at the CBS-TV network, which Presley was headlining for the second time. During that broadcast, a casual mention was made by Sullivan of the need to send aid to Hungarian refugees fleeing from the effects of the Soviet invasion. This led to Presley's official request, on his third and last appearance at Sullivan's Show and as a further 54.6 million viewers watched on 6 January 1957, for Mr. Sullivan, this time on his behalf, to request viewers to send their contributions. This was done by Mr. Sullivan himself with Presley off-camera as per the singer's request on two separate occasions during the broadcast and leading up to Presley's dedication of a song which, in his opinion, fit the mood properly as the  show's finale, namely the African American-written gospel song \"Peace in the Valley\". By the end of 1957,  these contributions, as handled by the Geneva-based International Red Cross, and which translated into perishables and non perishables, as well as food rations, clothing, and other essentials, had amounted to some CHF 26 million (US$6 million, in 1957 dollars) and the equivalent after inflation adjustments, of US$55.6 million in 2019 dollars.\n\n== Awards, prizes ==\n* Minor Cross of [[Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary]]\n* Officer's Cross of the [[Order of Merit of the Republic of Poland]] (2008)<ref>[http://isap.sejm.gov.pl/DetailsServlet?id=WMP20080840743]</ref>\n* Golden Degree of Szent Gell\u00e9rt Award\n* E\u00f6tv\u00f6s J\u00f3zsef Golden Medal\n* Henszlmann Imre Award\n* Remembrance Medal for Hungarian Urbanism\n* Grand Cross of Allegiance for Fatherland\n* Medal for Civil Organisations\n* Golden Seal-Ring Award of Mayors\n* Silver Medal of the Municipality of Sz\u00e9kelyudvarhely\n* Palatinus Medal of the Municipality of R\u00e9vkom\u00e1rom\n* '''Honored Citizen''', Budapest District III (from 2007)\n\n== Book ==\n* Tarl\u00f3s by K\u00e1roly Boros (Magyar H\u00e1z Kiad\u00f3, Budapest, 2007)\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20100313164136/http://www.tarlosistvan.hu/ Istv\u00e1n Tarl\u00f3s' Homepage]\n\n=== Interviews, debates ===\n* 3 January 2008 \u2013 [https://web.archive.org/web/20110718181315/http://www.hirado.hu/videotar/?id=15374 Criticizing the liberal Budapest-Policy], MTV Nap-Kelte\n* 3 January 2008 \u2013 [https://web.archive.org/web/20110721105112/http://www.echotv.hu/video/index.php?akt_menu=10&mm_id=32&media=2468&list=1)interj%C3%BA Without Taboos], Interview, [[Echo TV]]\n* 16 January 2008 \u2013 [https://web.archive.org/web/20110718181349/http://www.hirado.hu/cikk.php?id=254782 Debate, Istv\u00e1n Tarl\u00f3s and Ildik\u00f3 Lendvai (MSZP)], MTV Nagy K\u00e9rd\u00e9s\n\n=== Speeches ===\n* 17 August 2007 Civil Academy, [https://web.archive.org/web/20110721105700/http://www.echotv.hu/video/index.php?akt_menu=10&mm_id=24&media=1546&list=1) Speech of Istv\u00e1n Tarl\u00f3s], recorded by [[Echo TV]]\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-off}}\n{{Succession box\n| before = Imre Kiss\n| title  = [[\u00d3buda-B\u00e9k\u00e1smegyer|Mayor of \u00d3buda-B\u00e9k\u00e1smegyer]]\n| years = 1990&ndash;2006\n| after  = [[Bal\u00e1zs B\u00fas]]\n}}\n{{Succession box\n| before = [[G\u00e1bor Demszky]]\n| title  = [[Mayor of Budapest]]\n| years = 2010&ndash;2019\n| after  = [[Gergely Kar\u00e1csony]]\n}}\n{{s-end}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Tarlos, Istvan}}\n[[Category:1948 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:People from Budapest]]\n[[Category:Members of the National Assembly of Hungary (2010\u20132014)]]\n[[Category:Fidesz politicians]]\n[[Category:Alliance of Free Democrats politicians]]\n[[Category:Mayors of Budapest]]\n[[Category:Hungarian Roman Catholics]]\n[[Category:Recipients of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary]]\n", "name_user": "Maproom", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eRecognition of Elvis Presley:dc common noun", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Istv%C3%A1n_Tarl%C3%B3s"}

Mentioning re-runs in later years takes up too much space considering they are not really necessarily in the context of a programming list. It would also cause difficulties in trying to keep track of every year a particular film is aired, especially with the films that have not aired in a long time. The same practice is used for sections like \"Former original programming\" and \"Pilots and specials\" listed above, as Adult Swim tends to re-air things for years and years on a non-consistent basis after their original debut airings. If there are notable re-airings in subsequent years they can been mentioned in the description.-->\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:100%; background:#fff;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width: 19%;\" | Title\n! style=\"width: 12%;\" | Originally aired\n! style=\"width: 62%;\" | Description\n|-\n| ''[[Mind Game (film)|Mind Game]]'' || 2018 || 2004 animated film written and directed by [[Masaaki Yuasa]].

Mentioning re-runs in later years takes up too much space considering they are not really necessarily in the context of a programming list. It would also cause difficulties in trying to keep track of every year a particular film is aired, especially with the films that have not aired in a long time. The same practice is used for sections like \"Former original programming\" and \"Pilots and specials\" listed above, as Adult Swim tends to re-air things for years and years on a non-consistent basis after their original debut airings.
