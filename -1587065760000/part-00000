These reports were formerly geographically based and included the whole of the British Isles, but records for the [[Republic of Ireland]] and [[Northern Ireland]] are now published by their own ornithological associations. Records from the [[Isle of Man]], although adjudicated by the Manx Ornithological Society, continue to be published in the BOU reports.<ref name= bou>{{cite journal | last= Dudley | first= Steve P | last2= Gee |first2=Mike |last3=Kehoe|first3=Chris|last4=Melling|first4=Tim M|last5=The British Ornithologists' Union Records Committee (BOURC) | year= 2006| title= The British List:A Checklist of Birds of Britain (7th edition) | journal= Ibis | volume= 148 | pages= 526\u2013563 | url = http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/118619822/PDFSTART?CRETRY=1&SRETRY=0| doi = 10.1111/j.1474-919X.2006.00603.x}}{{dead link|date=February 2019|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>\n\nThe BOU uses the following categories for British bird species:<ref name= bou/>\n*A: species that have been recorded in an apparently natural state at least once since 1 January 1950.\n*B: species that were recorded in an apparently natural state at least once between 1 January 1800 and 31 December 1949, but have not been recorded subsequently.\n*C: species that, although originally introduced by man, either deliberately or accidentally, have established breeding populations derived from introduced stock, that maintain themselves without necessary recourse to further introduction.\nCategories A, B and C constitute the Official British List. Birds can be listed in more than one category, for example the [[Canada goose]] has a large introduced population, but there have also been a few naturally occurring vagrants, so it meets the criteria for categories A and C. Two further categories are used for record keeping only.\n*D: species that would otherwise appear in Categories A or B except that there is reasonable doubt that they have ever occurred in a natural state.\n*E: species that have been recorded as introductions, transportees or escapees from captivity, and whose breeding populations (if any) are thought not to be self-sustaining.\nBirds in Categories D and E are not on the official British list and are not included here. A sixth category, Category F, is being compiled to include species recorded before 1800 including fossil species.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.bou.org.uk/british-list/species-categories/|title= Species categories|author= BOURC|accessdate=9 December 2012}}</ref>\n\nSpecies listed here as '''rare''' are those for which a full description is required for acceptance of the record by the [[British Birbs Rarities Committee]]. Other species have an indication of their breeding and wintering status in Great Britain.\n\nBecause of its mild winters, Great Britain has a considerable population of wintering species, particularly [[duck]]s, [[goose|geese]] and [[swan]]s. There are also a number of species, such as the [[Eurasian oystercatcher|oystercatcher]], that are resident in this island, but migrants elsewhere. Also because of its position, Britain receives a number of vagrants from [[Asia]] and [[North America]]. Some American [[gull]]s, [[duck]]s and [[wader]]s are regular enough not to be considered rare. These include the [[ring-billed gull]], [[surf scoter]] and [[pectoral sandpiper]].\n\n__NOTOC__\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"margin:0 auto; width:98%; clear:both; text-align:center;\"\n!Table of contents\n|-\n| class=\"wikitable nowraplinks\" style=\"padding:0 2% 0 2%; text-align:center;\"|\n'''Non-passerines''':\n[[#Ducks, geese and swans|Ducks, geese and swans]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Grouse|Grouse]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Pheasants, partridges and quail|Pheasants, partridges and quail]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Divers|Divers]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Albatrosses|Albatrosses]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Shearwaters and petrels|Shearwaters and petrels]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Austral storm petrels|Austral storm petrels]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Northern storm petrels|Northern storm petrels]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Tropicbirds|Tropicbirbs]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Gannets and boobies|Gannets and boobies]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Cormorants|Cormorants]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Frigatebirds|Frigatebirds]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Pelicans|Pelicans]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Bitterns, herons and egrets|Bitterns, herons and egrets]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Ibises and spoonbills|Ibises and spoonbills]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Storks|Storks]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Grebes|Grebes]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Buzzards, kites and allies|Buzzards, kites and allies]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Osprey|Osprey]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Falcons|Falcons]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Rails, crakes and coots|Rails, crakes and coots]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Cranes|Cranes]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Bustards|Bustards]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Oystercatchers|Oystercatchers]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Avocets and stilts|Avocets and stilts]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Thick-knees|Thick-knees]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Pratincoles and coursers|Pratincoles and coursers]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Plovers and lapwings|Plovers and lapwings]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Sandpipers and allies|Sandpipers and allies]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Skuas|Skuas]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Gulls, terns, and skimmers|Gulls, terns, and skimmers]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Auks|Auks]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Sandgrouse|Sandgrouse]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Pigeons and doves|Pigeons and doves]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Parrots|Parrots]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Cuckoos|Cuckoos]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Barn owls|Barn owls]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Typical owls|Typical owls]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Nightjars|Nightjars]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Swifts|Swifts]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Kingfishers|Kingfishers]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Bee-eaters|Bee-eaters]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Rollers|Rollers]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Hoopoe|Hoopoe]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Woodpeckers|Woodpeckers]]\n|-\n| class=\"wikitable nowraplinks\" style=\"padding:0 2% 0 2%; text-align:center;\"|\n'''Passerines''':\n[[#Tyrant flycatchers|Tyrant flycatchers]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Vireos|Vireos]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Old World orioles|Old World orioles]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Shrikes|Shrikes]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Crows and allies|Crows and allies]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Kinglets|Kinglets]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Penduline tits|Penduline tits]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Tits|Tits]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Bearded tit|Bearded tit]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Larks|Larks]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Swallows and martins|Swallows and martins]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Bush warblers|Bush warbler]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Long-tailed tits|Long-tailed tits]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Leaf warblers|Leaf warblers]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Typical warblers|Typical warblers]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Grasshopper warblers|Grasshopper warblers]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Reed warblers|Reed warblers]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Cisticolas|Cisticolas]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Waxwings|Waxwings]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Wallcreeper|Wallcreeper]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Nuthatches|Nuthatches]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Treecreepers|Treecreepers]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Wrens|Wrens]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Mockingbirds and allies|Mockingbirds and allies]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Starlings|Starlings]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Dippers|Dippers]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Thrushes|Thrushes]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Old World flycatchers and chats|Old World flycatchers and chats]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Accentors|Accentors]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Sparrows|Sparrows]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Wagtails and pipits|Wagtails and pipits]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Finches|Finches]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Longspurs|Longspurs]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Cardinals and allies|Cardinals and allies]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Buntings and American sparrows|Buntings and American sparrows]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Icterids|Icterids]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#New World warblers|New World warblers]]\n|-\n| style=\"padding:0 2% 0 2%; text-align:center;\"|\n'''[[#Species awaiting acceptance|Species awaiting acceptance]]'''{{nbsp|7}}\n'''[[#See also|See also]]'''{{nbsp|7}}\n'''[[#Footnotes|Footnotes]]'''{{nbsp|7}}\n'''[[#References|References]]'''\n|}\n\n==Ducks, geese and swans==\n'''Order''': [[Anseriformes]]{{nbsp|3}}'''Family''': [[Anatidae]]\n\nThe swans, ducks and geese are medium to large birds that are adapted to an aquatic existence with webbed feet and [[beak|bills]] which are flattened to a greater or lesser extent.

Birds can be listed in more than one category, for example the [[Canada goose]] has a large introduced population, but there have also been a few naturally occurring vagrants, so it meets the criteria for categories A and C. Two further categories are used for record keeping only.\n*D: species that would otherwise appear in Categories A or B except that there is reasonable doubt that they have ever occurred in a natural state.\n*E: species that have been recorded as introductions, transportees or escapees from captivity, and whose breeding populations (if any) are thought not to be self-sustaining.\nBirds in Categories D and E are not on the official British list and are not included here. A sixth category, Category F, is being compiled to include species recorded before 1800 including fossil species.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.bou.org.uk/british-list/species-categories/|title= Species categories|author= BOURC|accessdate=9 December 2012}}</ref>\n\nSpecies listed here as '''rare''' are those for which a full description is required for acceptance of the record by the [[British Birds Rarities Committee]]. Other species have an indication of their breeding and wintering status in Great Britain.\n\nBecause of its mild winters, Great Britain has a considerable population of wintering species, particularly [[duck]]s, [[goose|geese]] and [[swan]]s. There are also a number of species, such as the [[Eurasian oystercatcher|oystercatcher]], that are resident in this island, but migrants elsewhere. Also because of its position, Britain receives a number of vagrants from [[Asia]] and [[North America]]. Some American [[gull]]s, [[duck]]s and [[wader]]s are regular enough not to be considered rare. These include the [[ring-billed gull]], [[surf scoter]] and [[pectoral sandpiper]].\n\n__NOTOC__\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"margin:0 auto; width:98%; clear:both; text-align:center;\"\n!Table of contents\n|-\n| class=\"wikitable nowraplinks\" style=\"padding:0 2% 0 2%; text-align:center;\"|\n'''Non-passerines''':\n[[#Ducks, geese and swans|Ducks, geese and swans]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Grouse|Grouse]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Pheasants, partridges and quail|Pheasants, partridges and quail]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Divers|Divers]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Albatrosses|Albatrosses]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Shearwaters and petrels|Shearwaters and petrels]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Austral storm petrels|Austral storm petrels]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Northern storm petrels|Northern storm petrels]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Tropicbirds|Tropicbirds]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Gannets and boobies|Gannets and boobies]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Cormorants|Cormorants]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Frigatebirds|Frigatebirds]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Pelicans|Pelicans]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Bitterns, herons and egrets|Bitterns, herons and egrets]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Ibises and spoonbills|Ibises and spoonbills]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Storks|Storks]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Grebes|Grebes]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Buzzards, kites and allies|Buzzards, kites and allies]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Osprey|Osprey]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Falcons|Falcons]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Rails, crakes and coots|Rails, crakes and coots]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Cranes|Cranes]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Bustards|Bustards]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Oystercatchers|Oystercatchers]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Avocets and stilts|Avocets and stilts]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Thick-knees|Thick-knees]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Pratincoles and coursers|Pratincoles and coursers]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Plovers and lapwings|Plovers and lapwings]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Sandpipers and allies|Sandpipers and allies]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Skuas|Skuas]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Gulls, terns, and skimmers|Gulls, terns, and skimmers]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Auks|Auks]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Sandgrouse|Sandgrouse]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Pigeons and doves|Pigeons and doves]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Parrots|Parrots]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Cuckoos|Cuckoos]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Barn owls|Barn owls]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Typical owls|Typical owls]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Nightjars|Nightjars]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Swifts|Swifts]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Kingfishers|Kingfishers]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Bee-eaters|Bee-eaters]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Rollers|Rollers]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Hoopoe|Hoopoe]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Woodpeckers|Woodpeckers]]\n|-\n| class=\"wikitable nowraplinks\" style=\"padding:0 2% 0 2%; text-align:center;\"|\n'''Passerines''':\n[[#Tyrant flycatchers|Tyrant flycatchers]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Vireos|Vireos]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Old World orioles|Old World orioles]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Shrikes|Shrikes]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Crows and allies|Crows and allies]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Kinglets|Kinglets]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Penduline tits|Penduline tits]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Tits|Tits]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Bearded tit|Bearded tit]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Larks|Larks]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Swallows and martins|Swallows and martins]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Bush warblers|Bush warbler]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Long-tailed tits|Long-tailed tits]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Leaf warblers|Leaf warblers]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Typical warblers|Typical warblers]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Grasshopper warblers|Grasshopper warblers]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Reed warblers|Reed warblers]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Cisticolas|Cisticolas]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Waxwings|Waxwings]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Wallcreeper|Wallcreeper]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Nuthatches|Nuthatches]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Treecreepers|Treecreepers]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Wrens|Wrens]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Mockingbirds and allies|Mockingbirds and allies]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Starlings|Starlings]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Dippers|Dippers]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Thrushes|Thrushes]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Old World flycatchers and chats|Old World flycatchers and chats]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Accentors|Accentors]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Sparrows|Sparrows]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Wagtails and pipits|Wagtails and pipits]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Finches|Finches]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Longspurs|Longspurs]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Cardinals and allies|Cardinals and allies]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Buntings and American sparrows|Buntings and American sparrows]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Icterids|Icterids]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#New World warblers|New World warblers]]\n|-\n| style=\"padding:0 2% 0 2%; text-align:center;\"|\n'''[[#Species awaiting acceptance|Species awaiting acceptance]]'''{{nbsp|7}}\n'''[[#See also|See also]]'''{{nbsp|7}}\n'''[[#Footnotes|Footnotes]]'''{{nbsp|7}}\n'''[[#References|References]]'''\n|}\n\n==Ducks, geese and swans==\n'''Order''': [[Anseriformes]]{{nbsp|3}}'''Family''': [[Anatidae]]\n\nThe swans, ducks and geese are medium to large birds that are adapted to an aquatic existence with webbed feet and [[beak|bills]] which are flattened to a greater or lesser extent.

When he was five years old a severe illness and operation left him with a permanently disabled foot. Just before [[World War II]] he was evacuated to Gwynedd, and was educated in [[Llandudno]] at the John Bright County School, where his interest in English language and literature was encouraged. He left school at the age of fifteen. Before he went on to study [[English literature]] at [[Bangor University]] he became interested in Christian theology, considered joining the Franciscan order, and studied for the Anglican presbyterate at the Community of the Resurrection near Leeds.  At Bangor University he was taught by R. T. Jenkins, H. D. Lewis and Charles Davies, and became an admirer of the craftsmanship of the poets [[Dylan Thomas]] and [[Roy Campbell (poet)|Roy Campbell]]. He met the painter, [[Brenda Chamberlain (artist)|Brenda Chamberlain]], and when she separated from the artist [[John Petts (artist)|John Petts]] and went to live on Bardsey island, he rented from her part of her cottage, Ty'r Mynydd.\n\n==Career in literature==\nBetween 1948 and 1960 Garlick worked as a teacher at Bangor, Pembroke Dock and Blaenau Ffestiniog. In 1948 he married Elin Hughes, a first-language Welsh speaker and convert to Roman Catholic Christianity. He became a Catholic on the eve of his wedding, and learnt Welsh from his wife. He and Elin adopted two children \u2013 Iestyn in 1952 and Angharad in 1958. The couple would remain together until the late 1970s.\n\nAfter teaching at Bangor he moved to Pembroke Dock in April 1949, to take up a post teaching English at Pembroke Dock County School, under [[Roland Mathias]].  That year, at the age of twenty-three, he became a co-founder of the review, ''Dock Leaves'' (from 1958 renamed ''[[The Anglo-Welsh Review]]'') and from 1949 to 1960 was its first editor. As editor he made contacts with many writers of Welsh and English; and during this time he also began broadcasting for the BBC. These years saw the appearance of his first books of poems \u2013 ''Poems from the Mountain House'' (1950), ''The Welsh-Speaking Sea'' (1954) and ''Requiem for a Poet'' (1954).\n\nIn 1954 he moved to teach at [[Blaenau Ffestiniog]], as he and Elin decided that they would like their adopted son to be brought up bilingual in English and Welsh. At Blaenau [[John Cowper Powys]] was one of his neighbours. In 1957 he published his poems, ''Blaenau Observed''.\n\nIn 1960 he left Wales, gave up his editorship of the ''Anglo-Welsh Review'' and began to teach at an international school at Eerde in the Netherlands. But in 1967 he returned to Wales, and eventually he became a Principal Lecturer, in charge of the Welsh Studies course, at Trinity College, Carmarthen (now part of the [[University of Wales, Trinity Saint David]]). There with enthusiasm he introduced his students to the works of such writers as [[David Jones (poet)|David Jones]], [[Idris Davies]], [[Glyn Jones (Welsh writer)|Glyn Jones]], [[Alun Lewis (poet)|Alun Lewis]], [[Dylan Thomas]], [[R. S. Thomas]], [[John Ormond]] and [[Leslie Norris]]. His own poetry was influenced by the writings of [[Roy Campbell (poet)|Roy Campbell]], and of [[R. S. Thomas]] and [[John Cowper Powys]]. During these years he published his ''A Sense of Europe'' (1968), ''A Sense of Time'' (1972) and ''Incense'' (1976), as well as his study, ''An Introduction to Anglo-Welsh Literature'' (1970) and the anthology, ''Anglo-Welsh Poetry 1480\u20131980'' (1984) (which he edited with Roland Mathias). He also established a link with the Central University of Iowa, USA, for their module on Anglo-Welsh literature.  He continued lecturing at Trinity until he retired in 1987, when his ''Collected Poems 1946\u201386'' appeared. He continued to live at Carmarthen, until at the end of his life he moved to a care home in Cardiff.\n\nIn the 1970s he and his family took part in non-violent campaigning for the use of Welsh-language road signs in Wales, and at one point his wife and son were arrested.  Garlick was a lifelong pacifist.  In the late 70s his wife chose to go and live in the Netherlands, and in 1982 he and she divorced. He lost his faith in Christianity (calling himself a 'Catholic Agnostic'), and he omitted his Christian poems from his ''Collected Poems'' of 1987.\n\nIn his retirement Garlick brought out two more books of poems, ''Travel Notes'' (1992) and ''The Delphic voyage and other poems'' (2003).\n\nIn 1995, during [[Swansea]]'s Year of Literature, a portrait of Garlick was made by the painter, Gordon Stuart.\n\nHe died on 19 March 2011 at Cardiff.\n\nAn extensive archive of his manuscripts is held at the National Library of Wales, Aberystwyth.\n\nThe poet [[Peter Finch (poet)|Peter Finch]], former chief executive of [[Literature Wales|Academi]] (Literature Wales is the national company for the development of literature in Wales), described Raymond Garlick as one of the five best mid-20th century English writers in Wales \u2013 along with [[R.

When he was five years old a severe illness and operation left him with a permanently disabled foot. Just before [[World War II]] he was evacuated to Gwynedd, and was educated in [[Llandudno]] at the John Bright County School, where his interest in English language and literature was encouraged. He left school at the age of fifteen. Before he went on to study [[English literature]] at [[Bangor University]] he became interested in Christian theology, considered joining the Franciscan order, and studied for the Anglican presbyterate at the Community of the Resurrection near Leeds.  At Bangor University he was taught by R. T. Jenkins, H. D. Lewis and Charles Davies, and became an admirer of the craftsmanship of the poets [[Dylan Thomas]] and [[Roy Campbell (poet)|Roy Campbell]]. He met the painter, [[Brenda Chamberlain (artist)|Brenda Chamberlain]], and when she separated from the artist [[John Petts (artist)|John Petts]] and went to live on Bardsey island, he rented from her part of her cottage, Ty'r Mynydd.\n\n==Career in literature==\nBetween 1948 and 1960 Garlick worked as a teacher at Bangor, Pembroke Dock and Blaenau Ffestiniog. In 1948 he married Elin Hughes, a first-language Welsh speaker and convert to Roman Catholic Christianity. He became a Catholic on the eve of his wedding, and learnt Welsh from his wife. He and Elin adopted two children \u2013 Iestyn in 1952 and Angharad in 1958. The couple would remain together until the late 1970s.\n\nAfter teaching at Bangor he moved to Pembroke Dock in April 1949, to take up a post teaching English at Pembroke Dock County School, under [[Roland Mathias]].  That year, at the age of twenty-three, he became a co-founder of the review, ''Dock Leaves'' (from 1958 renamed ''[[The Anglo-Welsh Review]]'') and from 1949 to 1960 was its first editor.

As land was expanded southward, it remained under Government control as possible locations of various Union Station expansions.  The majority of the land was still part of the lake up until the early 1900's. By 1925 The northern parcel of the property was turned into of Bayside Park, which had been part of an early proposal that was to have seen the lands south of the rail corridor transformed into an extensive lakeside park that followed today's Esplande. The remaining land was most likely under the control of Central Harbor Terminals.<ref>https://maps.library.utoronto.ca/dvhmp/maps.html</ref>\n\nIn the 1930s the property became the proposed home to [[Canada Post]]'s Toronto Postal Delivery Building. In the 1920's a postal handling facility already existed in the east wing of the city's then New Union Station (Downtown Toronto's 3rd major train station).<ref>{{cite book |last=Filey |first=Mike |author-link= |date=1992 |title=A Toronto Album 2: More Glimpses of the City That Was|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=K0tIsZ_TAIoC&pg=PA43 |location=Toronto |publisher=Dundurn Press |page=43 |isbn=}}</ref> But it quickly reached capacity by the 1930s due to major population growth of Toronto and its surrounding region.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.scotiabankarena.com/venue-information/about/history|title=History {{!}} Scotiabank Arena|last=Arena|first=Scotiabank|website=www.scotiabankarena.com|language=en|access-date=November 15, 2018}}</ref> In 1937 the Postmaster General appealed to the Minister of Public Works to approve a new replacement facility at the corner of Bay & Fleet Street (now Lake Shore Boulevard).

Required modifications were made to the building to return it back to its postal delivery purposes as a result of alterations done by the Department of National Defence.  After the refurbishment work was completed in 1948, the building now possessed the capability and equipment for proper mail sorting and other mailing processing functions. Though it was designed as a mail sorting warehouse it was also the home of Postal Station \"A\" which served mostly institutional & commercial clients.  The Ground floor was where the mail was dropped off by both railway carts and postal vans. Unsorted mail was moved by conveyor belts to the top floor and via gravity fed mail chutes sorted by size & destination.  Eventually the sorted mail would end up back on the ground floor where it would be sent out for delivery.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://torontoplaques.com/Pages/Toronto_Postal_Delivery_Building.html|title=History|language=en|access-date=April 16, 2020</ref> The building would be used as a postal sorting centre up until 1989.\n\n====Postal Building Sculptures==== \nThe structures most notable feature (which has been retained) are the exterior 13-part series of limestone [[bas relief]] carvings by [[Louis Temporale]] Sr. [[Order of Canada|CM]] which depicts the history of transportation and communication in Canada.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tayloronhistory.com/2013/02/12/torontos-architectural-gemsthe-postal-delivery-building-now-the-acc/|title=History|language=en|access-date=April 16, 2020}}</ref>  Carved in 1938-39 begins with scenes showing human speech, a runner carrying a message, aboriginals communicating by smoke signal, a group of voyageurs, a schooner & a Royal Mail steamship crossing the ocean from England, the CN train used during the 1939 Royal Tour, the mythical flying boat named 'Canopus' and northern travel by dog sled.<ref>{{cite book |last=Filey |first=Mike |author-link= |date=1992 |title=Toronto Sketches: The Way We Were |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=NNUAuL5S7gUC&pg=PA82 |location= |publisher=Dundurn Press |page=82 |isbn=}}</ref> The sculptors son Louis Temporale jr. helped with restoration efforts in 1998 and in 2016 was still critical of the lack of protection of the artwork by stadium ownership for over 20 years.

In a cost cutting move (part of larger overall service changes & cuts made to the Crown Corporation under the [[Brian Mulroney]] Conservatives), Canada Post decided to close the facility and move operations to an alternate more modern c.1970s letter processing faculty on nearby Eastern Avenue. A structure with easy access to highways was designed specificity for transport truck bulk delivery of mail. By 1989, all of the old building's work was transferred here.<ref name=\":0\" /> The 1980s real estate boom saw the building site become surrounded by numerous skyscrapers, hotels, convention centres, SkyDome stadium & condo towers.  In the early 1990s, real estate developers [[Bramalea (company)|Bramalea Ltd]] and [[Trizec Properties|Trizec]] arranged to purchase the building from Canada Post, with plans to redevelop the site into a {{convert|230,000|m2|sqft|adj=on}} office, retail and residential space. Financial and development details of the purchase imposed various conditions prior to development, including rezoning by the city, remediation of soil contamination by Canada Post.<ref>{{cite news|title=Bramalea's Moves Shake Taxpayers|first=Stevie|last=Cameron|date=November 15, 1992|publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]]}}</ref>\n\nBy this time a deep per-longed recession had taken hold in the province which saw many downtown Toronto high rise construction projects paused or cancelled outright. There was limited market demand for new office space one of the key requirements to acquiring bank loans. The resulting financing difficulties resulted in the building's ownership being reverted back to Canada Post in 1993 and with the structure remaining unused & abandoned. The Toronto Raptors owners purchased the unused building from Canada Post the following year.<ref name=\"rapnba\">{{cite web| url=http://www.nba.com/raptors/history/raptors_history.html/| title=Laying the Groundwork for the NBA in Toronto| website=nba.com| accessdate=October 14, 2017}}</ref>\n[[File:Postal terminal now Air Canada Centre.jpg|thumb|left|The arena retains the eastern & southern walls of the original postal structure built, through a process of [[facadism]].]]\nConstruction of the arena was started by the Toronto Raptors, under their initial ownership group headed by Canadian businessman [[John Bitove]]. In 1995, it had been decided that the NBA would expand into Canada. The Toronto Raptors were created and would need an indoor arena to play in. The Canada Post building was chosen to be the new home of the Raptors due to its downtown location and lot size. Other venues such as [[Exhibition Place]], North York Centre, Bay and Wellesley, and Bay and Dundas were also considered. The Canada Post building was purchased for {{CAD|60}} million.<ref name=\":0\" /> The Raptors initially played in SkyDome (now [[Rogers Centre]]) while the arena was constructed.<ref name=\"blogTo\">{{cite web|first=Chris|last=Bateman|title=That time the Raptors and the Maple Leafs moved to the ACC|url=http://www.blogto.com/city/2014/02/that_time_the_raptors_and_leafs_moved_to_the_acc/|website=blogTo|date=February 22, 2014|accessdate=December 4, 2017}}</ref> Groundbreaking took place in March 1997. The building retained the [[Art Deco]] Queenston limestone facade of the Toronto Postal Delivery Building along the east (along [[Bay Street]]) and south ([[Lake Shore Boulevard]]) walls of that structure, but the rest of the building (facing [[Union Station (Toronto)|Union Station]]) was removed to make room for the arena, through the process of [[facadism]]. The original building is protected under the ''[[Ontario Heritage Act]]''.\n\n====Arena 'Wars'====\nWhen MLGL ([[Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment|Maple Leaf Gardens, Limited]] at the time the controlling company of the Toronto Maple Leafs) lost out on their desire to be the franchise owners of the Raptors, competition between the two organizations heated up centred around venues. MLGL declined to allow Maple Leaf Gardens to be used for the NBA upstart as a result pushing Bitove to secure rights to have the Raptors' opening seasons played at SkyDome until construction of the new stadium to be complete.\n\nThe 1930s-era Maple Leaf Gardens was showing its age; the Maple Leafs in desperate desire for a new facility began developing plans for building an all-new stadium with one of the key criteria for the new location that it must be within close walking proximity to both the subway system and GO Transit. During the early stages of construction, MLGL floated to the media plans for their own plans to build a competing single-use stadium on adjacent property just to the north of the stadium atop the train sheds at Union Station (similar to how [[Madison Square Garden]] was constructed) as the new home for the Toronto Maple Leafs.<ref name=ArenaWars>{{cite news|title=Leafs ready to Move (Page 2)|first=Craig|last=Daniels|date=April 16, 1997|publisher=[[The Toronto Sun]]}}</ref> The reaction from Raptors was nothing but anger. \"This proposed (Maple Leaf) location really disturbs us\" stated team president Richard Peddie, who went on to say that they would fight the Leafs \"every step of the way\" and he didn't understand why the Leafs have refused to join with the Raptors at their site; claiming that the Leafs want to \"build virtually on top of us\".<ref name=\"ArenaWars\" /> The major problem of the Union Station proposal is the land that the stadium would be built on was actually City of Toronto land that was leased out to CN Rail and CP Rail, which were in a major, long-standing dispute over rent payments (dating back to 1969). As a result, MLGL offered the city $156 Million (1997 CAD) in cash & assets to settle any and all outstanding claims and to buy the air rights above the Union Station train platforms.\n\nDuring this period John Bitove who disputed over the future of the arena who as a result of a [[shotgun clause]] was forced to sell his stake to Allan Slaight (who wanted a joint arena deal with MLGL) and now with majority ownership immediately went into talks with MLGL which eventually purchased both the Raptors and their partially completed arena, which subsequently resulted in major modifications to the original design, which was basketball-specific, to make the arena become more suitable for hockey. Originally planned to cost $217&nbsp;million, MLGL increased the budget to $265&nbsp;million after taking control.<ref name=cost>{{cite news|title=Upgrades added to cost|first=David|last=Shoalts|date=February 17, 1999|publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]]}}</ref> The Raptors were twice fined a million dollars (which were donated to their charitable foundation) by the NBA for missing deadlines to begin construction of their new arena.<ref>{{cite news|title=Raptors' arena bites dust|last=Christe|first=James|date=May 16, 1997|publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]]}}</ref>\n\n====Construction==== \nAfter the purchase of the Raptors and the Air Canada Centre the new owners entered into a design-build contract with PCL with the commitment to finish the stadium in 24-months by March 1st 1999.<ref>https://canada.constructconnect.com/dcn/news/projects/2017/03/pcl-construction-reflects-on-building-the-air-canada-centre-1022273w</ref>  The intergartion of the Maple Leafs into the new structure would result in a 25% increase in construction costs (over $25 million CAD in 1999).<ref>https://canada.constructconnect.com/dcn/news/projects/2017/03/pcl-construction-reflects-on-building-the-air-canada-centre-1022273w</ref>\n\nThe completed structure included a 15-storey tower (reduced from a proposed 30-stories), four restaurants, and an underground parking lot. \n\n====Opening====\nIn 1998, a strange twist of scheduling conflicts had the Toronto Raptors playing their final regular-season game at [[Copps Coliseum]] in Hamilton, as the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] had first right of refusal for all SkyDome dates.

This boosted Toronto's economy and led to further construction in the downtown core. Many projects in the area were completed ahead of schedule as a result of a desire to increase the infrastructure of downtown Toronto, and also from private funding (approximately $13&nbsp;million) that was invested in seeing the economic growth of Toronto.

Infill of the inner harbour began in the 1850's and accelerated with the arrival of the railroad resulting in the current day shape of downtown.<ref>https://www.cgenarchive.org/toronto-lakeshores.html</ref>  By 1858 the site was located between two warfs (Rees & Tinnings Warf). As land was expanded southward, it remained under Government control as possible locations of various Union Station expansions.  The majority of the land was still part of the lake up until the early 1900's. By 1925 The northern parcel of the property was turned into of Bayside Park, which had been part of an early proposal that was to have seen the lands south of the rail corridor transformed into an extensive lakeside park that followed today's Esplande. The remaining land was most likely under the control of Central Harbor Terminals.<ref>https://maps.library.utoronto.ca/dvhmp/maps.html</ref>\n\nIn the 1930s the property became the proposed home to [[Canada Post]]'s Toronto Postal Delivery Building. In the 1920's a postal handling facility already existed in the east wing of the city's then New Union Station (Downtown Toronto's 3rd major train station).<ref>{{cite book |last=Filey |first=Mike |author-link= |date=1992 |title=A Toronto Album 2: More Glimpses of the City That Was|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=K0tIsZ_TAIoC&pg=PA43 |location=Toronto |publisher=Dundurn Press |page=43 |isbn=}}</ref> But it quickly reached capacity by the 1930s due to major population growth of Toronto and its surrounding region.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.scotiabankarena.com/venue-information/about/history|title=History {{!}} Scotiabank Arena|last=Arena|first=Scotiabank|website=www.scotiabankarena.com|language=en|access-date=November 15, 2018}}</ref> In 1937 the Postmaster General appealed to the Minister of Public Works to approve a new replacement facility at the corner of Bay & Fleet Street (now Lake Shore Boulevard).

Required modifications were made to the building to return it back to its postal delivery purposes as a result of alterations done by the Department of National Defence.  After the refurbishment work was completed in 1948, the building now possessed the capability and equipment for proper mail sorting and other mailing processing functions. Though it was designed as a mail sorting warehouse it was also the home of Postal Station \"A\" which served mostly institutional & commercial clients.  The Ground floor was where the mail was dropped off by both railway carts and postal vans. Unsorted mail was moved by conveyor belts to the top floor and via gravity fed mail chutes sorted by size & destination.

In a cost cutting move (part of larger overall service changes & cuts made to the Crown Corporation under the [[Brian Mulroney]] Conservatives), Canada Post decided to close the facility and move operations to an alternate more modern c.1970s letter processing faculty on nearby Eastern Avenue. A structure with easy access to highways was designed specificity for transport truck delivery of mail. By 1989, all of the old building's work was transferred here.<ref name=\":0\" /> The 1980s real estate boom saw the building site become surrounded by skyscrapers, hotels, convention centres, SkyDome stadium & condo towers.  In the early 1990s, real estate developers [[Bramalea (company)|Bramalea Ltd]] and [[Trizec Properties|Trizec]] arranged to purchase the building from Canada Post, and redevelop the site into a {{convert|230,000|m2|sqft|adj=on}} office, retail and residential space.

In 1995, it had been decided that the NBA would expand into Canada. The Toronto Raptors were created and would need an indoor arena to play in. The Canada Post building was chosen to be the new home of the Raptors due to its downtown location and lot size. Other venues such as [[Exhibition Place]], North York Centre, Bay and Wellesley, and Bay and Dundas were also considered. The Canada Post building was purchased for {{CAD|60}} million.<ref name=\":0\" /> The Raptors initially played in SkyDome (now [[Rogers Centre]]) while the arena was constructed.<ref name=\"blogTo\">{{cite web|first=Chris|last=Bateman|title=That time the Raptors and the Maple Leafs moved to the ACC|url=http://www.blogto.com/city/2014/02/that_time_the_raptors_and_leafs_moved_to_the_acc/|website=blogTo|date=February 22, 2014|accessdate=December 4, 2017}}</ref> Groundbreaking took place in March 1997. The building retained the [[Art Deco]] Queenston limestone facade of the Toronto Postal Delivery Building along the east (along [[Bay Street]]) and south ([[Lake Shore Boulevard]]) walls of that structure, but the rest of the building (facing [[Union Station (Toronto)|Union Station]]) was removed to make room for the arena, through the process of [[facadism]]. The original building is protected under the ''[[Ontario Heritage Act]]''.\n\n====Arena 'Wars'====\nWhen MLGL ([[Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment|Maple Leaf Gardens, Limited]] at the time the controlling company of the Toronto Maple Leafs) lost out on their desire to be the franchise owners of the Raptors, competition between the two organizations heated up centred around venues. MLGL declined to allow Maple Leaf Gardens to be used for the NBA upstart as a result pushing Bitove to secure rights to have the Raptors' opening seasons played at SkyDome until construction of the new stadium to be complete.\n\nThe 1930s-era Maple Leaf Gardens was showing its age; the Maple Leafs in desperate desire for a new facility began developing plans for building an all-new stadium with one of the key criteria for the new location that it must be within close walking proximity to both the subway system and GO Transit. During the early stages of construction, MLGL floated to the media plans for their own plans to build a competing single-use stadium on adjacent property just to the north of the stadium atop the train sheds at Union Station (similar to how [[Madison Square Garden]] was constructed) as the new home for the Toronto Maple Leafs.<ref name=ArenaWars>{{cite news|title=Leafs ready to Move (Page 2)|first=Craig|last=Daniels|date=April 16, 1997|publisher=[[The Toronto Sun]]}}</ref> The reaction from Raptors was nothing but anger. \"This proposed (Maple Leaf) location really disturbs us\" stated team president Richard Peddie, who went on to say that they would fight the Leafs \"every step of the way\" and he didn't understand why the Leafs have refused to join with the Raptors at their site; claiming that the Leafs want to \"build virtually on top of us\".<ref name=\"ArenaWars\" /> The major problem of the Union Station proposal is the land that the stadium would be built on was actually City of Toronto land that was leased out to CN Rail and CP Rail, which were in a major, long-standing dispute over rent payments (dating back to 1969). As a result, MLGL offered the city $156 Million (1997 CAD) in cash & assets to settle any and all outstanding claims and to buy the air rights above the Union Station train platforms.\n\nDuring this period John Bitove who disputed over the future of the arena who as a result of a [[shotgun clause]] was forced to sell his stake to Allan Slaight (who wanted a joint arena deal with MLGL) and now with majority ownership immediately went into talks with MLGL which eventually purchased both the Raptors and their partially completed arena, which subsequently resulted in major modifications to the original design, which was basketball-specific, to make the arena become more suitable for hockey. Originally planned to cost $217&nbsp;million, MLGL increased the budget to $265&nbsp;million after taking control.<ref name=cost>{{cite news|title=Upgrades added to cost|first=David|last=Shoalts|date=February 17, 1999|publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]]}}</ref> The Raptors were twice fined a million dollars (which were donated to their charitable foundation) by the NBA for missing deadlines to begin construction of their new arena.<ref>{{cite news|title=Raptors' arena bites dust|last=Christe|first=James|date=May 16, 1997|publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]]}}</ref>\n\n====Construction==== \nAfter the purchase of the Raptors and the Air Canada Centre the new owners entered into a design-build contract with PCL with the commitment to finish the stadium in 24-months by March 1st 1999.<ref>https://canada.constructconnect.com/dcn/news/projects/2017/03/pcl-construction-reflects-on-building-the-air-canada-centre-1022273w</ref>  The intergartion of the Maple Leafs into the new structure would result in a 25% increase in construction costs (over $25 million CAD in 1999).<ref>https://canada.constructconnect.com/dcn/news/projects/2017/03/pcl-construction-reflects-on-building-the-air-canada-centre-1022273w</ref>\n\nThe completed structure included a 15-storey tower (reduced from a proposed 30-stories), four restaurants, and an underground parking lot. \n\n====Opening====\nIn 1998, a strange twist of scheduling conflicts had the Toronto Raptors playing their final regular-season game at [[Copps Coliseum]] in Hamilton, as the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] had first right of refusal for all SkyDome dates.  The Raptors had attempted to play the April 19 match at Maple Leaf Gardens, but were unsuccessful.<ref>{{cite news|title=Raptors Move Final Game to Hamilton|date=January 7, 1998|publisher=[[Associated Press]]|url=https://www.apnews.com/7027ff09054e45b3b7471205f12cb521}}</ref>\n[[File:Air Canada Centre in 1999.jpg|thumb|right|Air Canada Centre in July 1999, five months after the arena opened]]\n\nOn December 30th 1998, the building's construction was completed, 9 days ahead of schedule.

This boosted Toronto's economy and led to further construction in the downtown core. Many projects in the area were completed ahead of schedule as a result of a desire to increase the infrastructure of downtown Toronto, and also from private funding (approximately $13&nbsp;million) that was invested in seeing the economic growth of Toronto.

He is now a television pundit for [[Fox Sports]] as well as general manager and technical director for [[Los Angeles Blues]] in the American [[USL Pro]] league.\n\n==Club career==\nBorn in [[Stoke Newington]], London, Barton began his league career with [[Maidstone United F.C. (1897)|Maidstone United]], after joining from [[Dagenham F.C.|Dagenham]] who negotiated for three players and a manager, [[John Still (footballer)|John Still]] to move the other way.\n\nDespite some defensive weaknesses, he gained attention from clubs playing in higher tiers of English football due to his ability to move forward at speed up the flank with the ball and place the ball in the box accurately.\n\nDuring this period, Barton had a 'day job' working in the mailroom at the London offices of accounting firm, [[Arthur Andersen]].\n\n===Wimbledon===\nBarton was transferred to First Division side [[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]] on 7 June 1990, his \u00a3300,000 transfer fee being the largest sum paid for a Fourth Division player at the time. However, Maidstone were sliding into a serious financial crisis at this time and his sale did little to improve matters, although it would be another two years before financial problems finally forced them out of business and cost them their place in the Football League.\n\nBarton walked straight into the Wimbledon first team, missing just one league game in the [[1990\u201391 in English football|1990\u201391 season]] as they finished seventh. His first game was in the 3\u20130 defeat at home to [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] on the opening day of the season.\n\nHe remained a regular fixture at right-back for the rest of his time there, despite playing under three different managers; [[Ray Harford]] (July 1990 \u2013 October 1991), [[Peter Withe]] (October 1991 \u2013 January 1992) and finally [[Joe Kinnear]].\n\nDuring his time at Wimbledon he was instrumental in keeping them in the [[FA Premier League|Premiership]], and quickly became one of the most highly rated defenders in England. However, Barton had the most successful spell of his career with the Dons after they moved him into midfield, where his accurate passing set up many goals for the [[Crazy Gang (football)|Crazy Gang]]'s forwards.\n\nWimbledon were widely regarded as the smallest club in the top flight, traditionally having the lowest crowds and the smallest budget to spend on players, but they managed to avoid relegation year after year, more often than not by a comfortable margin, at a time when bigger clubs like [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] went down. Barton helped them finish sixth in 1994 \u2013 the best finish in their history.<ref name=\"sportingheroes\" />\n\n===Newcastle United===\nOn 5 June 1995, Barton became the most expensive defender in English football when he moved to [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] for \u00a34&nbsp;million, joining \"The Entertainers\" being assembled by [[Kevin Keegan]]. Everything looked rosy for Barton, and a few England caps followed, his classy, comfortable style on the ball earned him a reputation as a true footballing full-back. His attacking role under Keegan however meant he did not always suit the national team and he did not make too many more appearances for [[England national football team|England]].\n\nHe made his debut on 19 August 1995, when the Magpies beat [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]] 3\u20130 at [[St James' Park]]. He played 31 times that season, and by Christmas it was looking certain that he would be collecting a league title medal as the Magpies had a 10-point lead over [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] at the top of the Premier League. However, when the Magpies lost 1\u20130 at home to the [[Old Trafford]] side on 4 March 1996, the lead had been cut to a single point and soon afterwards they were overhauled, having to settle for second place in the final table.\n\nOver the next two seasons, Barton's first team opportunities were more limited as manager Kevin Keegan and his successor [[Kenny Dalglish]] (who took over in January 1997) chose [[Steve Watson]] as a right back more frequently.<ref name=\"sportingheroes\">http://www.sporting-heroes.net/football-heroes/displayhero_club.asp?HeroID=38236</ref>\n\nHowever, Watson's move to [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] in October 1998 saw Barton return to the right-back position on a more regular basis under new manager [[Ruud Gullit]], and he was still the club's first choice player in this position in [[2000\u201301 in English football|2000\u201301]], by which time the Magpies were being managed by the former England boss [[Bobby Robson]].\n\nBarton finally lost his first team place in the [[2001\u201302 in English football|2001\u201302 season]] to [[Aaron Hughes]] and this time he was unable to win it back. He made just five league appearances before joining [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] for a fee of \u00a3200,000 on 1 February 2002, ending nearly seven years on [[Tyneside]].<ref name=\"sportingheroes\" />\n\n===Derby County===\nBarton was manager [[John Gregory (footballer)|John Gregory]]'s first signing for a Derby County side battling against relegation from the Premier League, and played in all of their final 14 league games. At first, things went smoothly enough at [[Pride Park Stadium|Pride Park]], with two quick wins following by a point against title chasing Manchester United suggesting that the Rams were on their way to safety. But seven defeats from the final eight games cost them their top flight status after six seasons, and with financial problems putting the club under serious pressure, there was little prospect of a swift return.\n\nDerby finished 18th in the [[2002\u201303 in English football|2002\u201303]] Division One campaign, well short of the playoffs even though they were never in any real danger of a second successive relegation. Barton remained the club's first choice right-back, but following Gregory's dismissal in favour of [[George Burley]], Barton did not feature in the first team in the [[2003\u201304 in English football|2003\u201304 season]], finally departing in October when he joined Division Two promotion chasers [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] on a free transfer.<ref name=\"sportingheroes\" />\n\n===Queens Park Rangers===\nBarton played just five first team games during his four months at [[Loftus Road]], before returning to Wimbledon on a free transfer on 27 February 2004. The Hoops went on to secure promotion to Division One.\n\n===Return to Wimbledon===\nA lot had changed at Wimbledon Football Club since Barton had last played for them nine years earlier. They had survived in the Premier League for five seasons after his departure, finally going down in [[1999-2000 in English football|1999\u20132000]]. The decision to [[Relocation of Wimbledon F.C. to Milton Keynes|relocate]] the club to [[Milton Keynes]] was approved in May 2002, after the Dons narrowly missed out on the Division One playoffs for the second season running. In spite of some of the lowest attendances in the league after the majority of the club's fans defected to newly formed [[AFC Wimbledon]] (at non-League level), the Dons had managed a respectable 10th-place finish in [[2002\u201303 in English football|2002\u201303]], but then they went into administration and were forced to sell most of their key players.

He is now a television pundit for [[Fox Sports]] as well as general manager and technical director for [[Los Angeles Blues]] in the American [[USL Pro]] league.\n\n==Club career==\nBorn in [[Stoke Newington]], London, Barton began his league career with [[Maidstone United F.C. (1897)|Maidstone United]], after joining from [[Dagenham F.C.|Dagenham]] who negotiated for three players and a manager, [[John Still (footballer)|John Still]] to move the other way.\n\nDespite some defensive weaknesses, he gained attention from clubs playing in higher tiers of English football due to his ability to move forward at speed up the flank with the ball and place the ball in the box accurately.\n\nDuring this period, Barton had a 'day job' working in the mailroom at the London offices of accounting firm, [[Arthur Andersen]].\n\n===Wimbledon===\nBarton was transferred to First Division side [[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]] on 7 June 1990, his \u00a3300,000 transfer fee being the largest sum paid for a Fourth Division player at the time. However, Maidstone were sliding into a serious financial crisis at this time and his sale did little to improve matters, although it would be another two years before financial problems finally forced them out of business and cost them their place in the Football League.\n\nBarton walked straight into the Wimbledon first team, missing just one league game in the [[1990\u201391 in English football|1990\u201391 season]] as they finished seventh. His first game was in the 3\u20130 defeat at home to [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] on the opening day of the season.\n\nHe remained a regular fixture at right-back for the rest of his time there, despite playing under three different managers; [[Ray Harford]] (July 1990 \u2013 October 1991), [[Peter Withe]] (October 1991 \u2013 January 1992) and finally [[Joe Kinnear]].\n\nDuring his time at Wimbledon he was instrumental in keeping them in the [[FA Premier League|Premiership]], and quickly became one of the most highly rated defenders in England. However, Barton had the most successful spell of his career with the Dons after they moved him into midfield, where his accurate passing set up many goals for the [[Crazy Gang (football)|Crazy Gang]]'s forwards.\n\nWimbledon were widely regarded as the smallest club in the top flight, traditionally having the lowest crowds and the smallest budget to spend on players, but they managed to avoid relegation year after year, more often than not by a comfortable margin, at a time when bigger clubs like [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] went down. Barton helped them finish sixth in 1994 \u2013 the best finish in their history.<ref name=\"sportingheroes\" />\n\n===Newcastle United===\nOn 5 June 1995, Barton became the most expensive defender in English football when he moved to [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] for \u00a34&nbsp;million, joining \"The Entertainers\" being assembled by [[Kevin Keegan]]. Everything looked rosy for Barton, and a few England caps followed, his classy, comfortable style on the ball earned him a reputation as a true footballing full-back. His attacking role under Keegan however meant he did not always suit the national team and he did not make too many more appearances for [[England national football team|England]].\n\nHe made his debut on 19 August 1995, when the Magpies beat [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]] 3\u20130 at [[St James' Park]]. He played 31 times that season, and by Christmas it was looking certain that he would be collecting a league title medal as the Magpies had a 10-point lead over [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] at the top of the Premier League. However, when the Magpies lost 1\u20130 at home to the [[Old Trafford]] side on 4 March 1996, the lead had been cut to a single point and soon afterwards they were overhauled, having to settle for second place in the final table.\n\nOver the next two seasons, Barton's first team opportunities were more limited as manager Kevin Keegan and his successor [[Kenny Dalglish]] (who took over in January 1997) chose [[Steve Watson]] as a right back more frequently.<ref name=\"sportingheroes\">http://www.sporting-heroes.net/football-heroes/displayhero_club.asp?HeroID=38236</ref>\n\nHowever, Watson's move to [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] in October 1998 saw Barton return to the right-back position on a more regular basis under new manager [[Ruud Gullit]], and he was still the club's first choice player in this position in [[2000\u201301 in English football|2000\u201301]], by which time the Magpies were being managed by the former England boss [[Bobby Robson]].\n\nBarton finally lost his first team place in the [[2001\u201302 in English football|2001\u201302 season]] to [[Aaron Hughes]] and this time he was unable to win it back. He made just five league appearances before joining [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] for a fee of \u00a3200,000 on 1 February 2002, ending nearly seven years on [[Tyneside]].<ref name=\"sportingheroes\" />\n\n===Derby County===\nBarton was manager [[John Gregory (footballer)|John Gregory]]'s first signing for a Derby County side battling against relegation from the Premier League, and played in all of their final 14 league games. At first, things went smoothly enough at [[Pride Park Stadium|Pride Park]], with two quick wins following by a point against title chasing Manchester United suggesting that the Rams were on their way to safety. But seven defeats from the final eight games cost them their top flight status after six seasons, and with financial problems putting the club under serious pressure, there was little prospect of a swift return.\n\nDerby finished 18th in the [[2002\u201303 in English football|2002\u201303]] Division One campaign, well short of the playoffs even though they were never in any real danger of a second successive relegation. Barton remained the club's first choice right-back, but following Gregory's dismissal in favour of [[George Burley]], Barton did not feature in the first team in the [[2003\u201304 in English football|2003\u201304 season]], finally departing in October when he joined Division Two promotion chasers [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] on a free transfer.<ref name=\"sportingheroes\" />\n\n===Queens Park Rangers===\nBarton played just five first team games during his four months at [[Loftus Road]], before returning to Wimbledon on a free transfer on 27 February 2004. The Hoops went on to secure promotion to Division One.\n\n===Return to Wimbledon===\nA lot had changed at Wimbledon Football Club since Barton had last played for them nine years earlier. They had survived in the Premier League for five seasons after his departure, finally going down in [[1999-2000 in English football|1999\u20132000]]. The decision to [[Relocation of Wimbledon F.C. to Milton Keynes|relocate]] the club to [[Milton Keynes]] was approved in May 2002, after the Dons narrowly missed out on the Division One playoffs for the second season running. In spite of some of the lowest attendances in the league after the majority of the club's fans defected to newly formed [[AFC Wimbledon]] (at non-League level), the Dons had managed a respectable 10th-place finish in [[2002\u201303 in English football|2002\u201303]], but then they went into administration and were forced to sell most of their key players. As a result, their fortunes on the pitch suffered and the move to Milton Keynes in September 2003 (initially in the [[former England National Hockey Stadium|National Hockey Stadium]] until a new permanent stadium was built) did little to solve matters. By the time Barton arrived at the end of February, the club was still in administration and relegation (if not complete closure) was almost certain. Barton appeared in just five games for the Dons as they went down in bottom place with a massive 33 defeats (one of the worst Football League records ever) and on 17 September 2004 he finally departed from the club, who for the [[2004-05 in English football|2004\u201305]] had been re-formed as [[Milton Keynes Dons F.C.|Milton Keynes Dons]] to reflect their new location. At the age of 35, Barton's senior career was over.\n\n===Dagenham & Redbridge===\nOn leaving Milton Keynes Dons, Barton dropped into [[non-League football]] to play for [[Conference National]] club Dagenham & Redbridge. He was selected just twice for the \"Daggers\", before finally hanging up his boots on 31 May 2005.<ref>http://www.soccerbase.com/players_details.sd?playerid=470</ref>\n\n==International career==\nBarton made his debut for [[England national football team|England]] in the February 1995 friendly away match against the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]] which was abandoned after only 27 minutes because of rioting English fans.

Recommendations for healthcare workers, such as [[primary care provider]]s and [[nurse]]s, who are often suited to encounter suspected abuse are advised to firstly determine the child's immediate need for safety. A private environment away from suspected abusers is desired for interviewing and examining. Leading statements that can distort the story are avoided. As disclosing abuse can be distressing and sometimes even shameful, reassuring the child that he or she has done the right thing by telling and that they are not bad and that the abuse was not their fault helps in disclosing more information. [[Anatomically correct doll]]s are sometimes used to help explain what happened, although some researchers consider the dolls too explicit and overstimulating, which might contribute to non-abused children behaving with the dolls in one or more ways that suggest they were sexually abused.<ref name=\"Segal\">{{cite book|authors=Daniel L.

Which course is used depends on a variety of factors that must be assessed on a case-by-case basis. For instance, treatment of young children generally requires strong parental involvement and can benefit from family therapy. Adolescents tend to be more independent; they can benefit from individual or group therapy. The modality also shifts during the course of treatment; for example, group therapy is rarely used in the initial stages, as the subject matter is very personal and/or embarrassing.<ref name=NCCAN/>\n\nMajor factors that affect both the pathology and response to treatment include the type and severity of the sexual act, its frequency, the age at which it occurred, and the child's family of origin.  Roland C. Summit, a medical doctor, defined the different stages the victims of child sexual abuse go through, called [[child sexual abuse accommodation syndrome]]. He suggested that children who are victims of sexual abuse display a range of symptoms that include secrecy, helplessness, entrapment, accommodation, delayed and conflicted disclosure and recantation.<ref name=\"Summit\">{{cite journal|last=Summit|first=Roland C.|title=The child sexual abuse accommodation syndrome|journal=Child Abuse & Neglect|date=January 1983|volume=7|issue=22|pmid=6605796|url=|doi=10.1016/0145-2134(83)90070-4|pages=177\u201393}}</ref>\n\n===Adults===\nAdults who have been sexually abused as children often present for treatment with a secondary mental health issue, which can include [[substance abuse]], [[eating disorders]], [[personality disorders]], [[Depression (mood)|depression]], and conflict in romantic or interpersonal relationships.<ref name=\"Swaby-\">{{Cite journal| last1 = Swaby | first1 = AN. | last2 = Morgan | first2 = KA. | title = The relationship between childhood sexual abuse and sexual dysfunction in Jamaican adults | journal = J Child Sex Abuse | volume = 18 | issue = 3 | pages = 247\u201366 | year =  2009| doi =  10.1080/10538710902902679| pmid = 19856732 }}</ref>\n\nGenerally, the approach is to focus on the present problem, rather than the abuse itself. Treatment is highly varied and depends on the person's specific issues. For instance, a person with a history of sexual abuse suffering from severe depression would be treated for [[Major depressive disorder|depression]]. However, there is often an emphasis on [[cognitive restructuring]] due to the deep-seated nature of the trauma. Some newer techniques such as [[eye movement desensitization and reprocessing]] (EMDR) have been shown to be effective.<ref>{{Cite journal| last1 = Edmond | first1 = T. | last2 = Rubin | first2 = A. | title = Assessing the long-term effects of EMDR: results from an 18-month follow-up study with adult female survivors of CSA | journal = J Child Sex Abuse | volume = 13 | issue = 1 | pages = 69\u201386 | year = 2004 | doi =  10.1300/J070v13n01_04| pmid = 15353377 }}</ref>\n\nSexual abuse is associated with many sub-clinical behavioral issues as well, including [[re-victimization]] in the teenage years, a bipolar-like switching between sexual compulsion and shut-down, and [[cognitive distortion|distorted thinking]] on the subject of sexual abuse (for instance, that it is common and happens to everyone).  When first presenting for treatment, the patient can be fully aware of their abuse as an event, but their ''appraisal'' of it is often distorted, such as believing that the event was unremarkable (a form of [[Isolation (psychology)|isolation]]). Frequently, victims do not make the connection between their abuse and their present pathology.\n\n==Prevention==\nChild sexual abuse prevention programmes were developed in the United States of America during the 1970s.

By 1968 44 out of 50 U.S. states had enacted mandatory laws that required physicians to report cases of suspicious child abuse. Legal action began to become more prevalent in the 1970s with the enactment of the [[Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act]] in 1974 in conjunction with the creation of the National Center for Child Abuse and Neglect. Since the creation of the Child Abuse and Treatment Act, reported child abuse cases have increased dramatically.  Finally, the [[National Abuse Coalition]] was created in 1979 to create pressure in congress to create more sexual abuse laws.\n\n[[Second wave feminism]] brought greater awareness of child sexual abuse and [[violence against women]], and made them public, political issues.<ref>{{citation | last1 = Reavey | first1 = Paula | last2 = Warner | first2 = Sam | contribution = Introduction | editor-last1 = Reavey | editor-first1 = Paula | editor-last2 = Warner | editor-first2 = Sam | title = New feminist stories of child sexual abuse: sexual scripts and dangerous dialogues | page = 2 | publisher = New York Routledge | location = London | year = 2003 | isbn = 9780415259446 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=obHkvCPnos0C&pg=PA2 Preview.]</ref><ref>{{citation | last = Valentich | first = Mary | contribution = Feminist theory and social work practice (child sexual abuse) | editor-last = Turner | editor-first = Francis J. | title = Social work treatment: interlocking theoretical approaches | page = 215 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = New York | year = 2011 | isbn = 9780195394658 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=x_k8Aptn6tEC&pg=PA215 Preview.]</ref> [[Judith Lewis Herman]], Harvard professor of psychiatry, wrote the first book ever on father-daughter incest when she discovered during her medical residency that a large number of the women she was seeing had been victims of father-daughter incest.

Cling,\n\n<blockquote>\"By the early 21st century, the issue of child sexual abuse has become a legitimate focus of professional attention, while increasingly separated from second wave feminism...As child sexual abuse becomes absorbed into the larger field of interpersonal trauma studies, child sexual abuse studies and intervention strategies have become degendered and largely unaware of their political origins in modern feminism and other vibrant political movements of the 1970s. One may hope that unlike in the past, this rediscovery of child sexual abuse that began in the 70s will not again be followed by collective amnesia. The institutionalization of child maltreatment interventions in federally funded centers, national and international societies, and a host of research studies (in which the United States continues to lead the world) offers grounds for cautious optimism. Nevertheless, as Judith Herman argues cogently, 'The systematic study of psychological trauma...depends on the support of a political movement.'\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Sexualized Violence Against Women and Children: A Psychology and Law Perspective|author=B.J.

Increased awareness of child sexual abuse has encouraged more victims to come forward, whereas in the past victims often kept their abuse secret. Some states have enacted specific [[laws]] lengthening the applicable [[statutes of limitations]] so as to allow victims of child sexual abuse to file suit sometimes years after they have reached the age of majority.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ncsl.org/research/human-services/state-civil-statutes-of-limitations-in-child-sexua.aspx|title=State Civil Statutes of Limitations in Child Sexual Abuse Cases|last=Legislatures|first=National Conference of State|website=www.ncsl.org|access-date=2017-10-18}}</ref>  Such lawsuits can be brought where a person or entity, such as a school, church or youth organization, or daycare was charged with supervising the child but failed to do so with child sexual abuse resulting, making the individual or institution liable.  In the [[Catholic sex abuse cases]] the various [[Roman Catholic]] Diocese in the [[United States]] have paid out approximately $1 billion settling hundreds of such lawsuits since the early 1990s.  There have also been lawsuits involving the American [[Christian right|Religious Right]].  Crimes have allegedly gone unreported and victims were pressured into silence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailykos.com/story/2013/05/25/1211671/-The-Church-Child-Sex-Abuse-Scandal-Widens-and-Deepens|title=The Church Child Sex Abuse Scandal Widens and Deepens|work=dailykos.com|accessdate=23 March 2015}}</ref>\nAs lawsuits can involve demanding procedures there is a concern that [[children]] or adults who file suit will be re-victimized by defendants through the [[legal process]], much as [[rape]] victims can be re-victimized by the accused in [[criminal]] rape trials.

Cifarelli]] has written that children involved in the legal system, particularly victims of sexual abuse and molestation, should be afforded certain procedural safeguards to protect them from harassment during the legal process.<ref>Cifarelli, T.A.,''Shielding Minors'', Los Angeles Daily Journal, (October 10, 2001).</ref>\n\nIn June 2008 in [[Zambia]] the issue of teacher-student sexual abuse and sexual assault was brought to the attention of the High Court of Zambia where a landmark case decision, with presiding Judge Philip Musonda, awarded $45million Zambian kwacha (US$13,000) to the plaintiff, a 13-year-old girl for sexual abuse and rape by her school teacher. This claim was brought against her teacher as a \"person of authority\" who, as Judge Musonda stated, \"had a moral superiority (responsibility) over his students\" at the time.<ref>[http://womennewsnetwork.net/2008/08/11/rapecasezambia-articl804/ \"When A Girl Student Stands Up and Wins\"], ''Women News Network'' \u2013 WNN, August 11, 2008</ref>\n\nA 2000 World Health Organization \u2013 Geneva report, \u201cWorld Report on Violence and Health (Chap 6 \u2013 Sexual Violence)\u201d states, \u201cAction in schools is vital for reducing sexual and other forms of violence. In many countries a sexual relation between a teacher and a pupil is not a serious disciplinary offence and policies on sexual harassment in schools either do not exist or are not implemented. In recent years, though, some countries have introduced laws prohibiting sexual relations between teachers and pupils. Such measures are important in helping eradicate sexual harassment in schools. At the same time, a wider range of actions is also needed, including changes to teacher training and recruitment and reforms of curricula, so as to transform gender relations in schools.\u201d<ref>[http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2002/9241545615_chap6_eng.pdf World Health Organization Report on Sexual Violence], 2002</ref>\n\n==See

Recommendations for healthcare workers, such as [[primary care provider]]s and [[nurse]]s, who are often suited to encounter suspected abuse are advised to firstly determine the child's immediate need for safety. A private environment away from suspected abusers is desired for interviewing and examining. Leading statements that can distort the story are avoided. As disclosing abuse can be distressing and sometimes even shameful, reassuring the child that he or she has done the right thing by telling and that they are not bad and that the abuse was not their fault helps in disclosing more information. [[Anatomically correct doll]]s are sometimes used to help explain what happened, although some researchers consider the dolls too explicit and overstimulating, which might contribute to non-abused children behaving with the dolls in one or more ways that suggest they were sexually abused.<ref name=\"Segal\">{{cite book|authors=Daniel L.

Which course is used depends on a variety of factors that must be assessed on a case-by-case basis. For instance, treatment of young children generally requires strong parental involvement and can benefit from family therapy. Adolescents tend to be more independent; they can benefit from individual or group therapy. The modality also shifts during the course of treatment; for example, group therapy is rarely used in the initial stages, as the subject matter is very personal and/or embarrassing.<ref name=NCCAN/>\n\nMajor factors that affect both the pathology and response to treatment include the type and severity of the sexual act, its frequency, the age at which it occurred, and the child's family of origin.  Roland C. Summit, a medical doctor, defined the different stages the victims of child sexual abuse go through, called [[child sexual abuse accommodation syndrome]]. He suggested that children who are victims of sexual abuse display a range of symptoms that include secrecy, helplessness, entrapment, accommodation, delayed and conflicted disclosure and recantation.<ref name=\"Summit\">{{cite journal|last=Summit|first=Roland C.|title=The child sexual abuse accommodation syndrome|journal=Child Abuse & Neglect|date=January 1983|volume=7|issue=22|pmid=6605796|url=|doi=10.1016/0145-2134(83)90070-4|pages=177\u201393}}</ref>\n\n===Adults===\nAdults who have been sexually abused as children often present for treatment with a secondary mental health issue, which can include [[substance abuse]], [[eating disorders]], [[personality disorders]], [[Depression (mood)|depression]], and conflict in romantic or interpersonal relationships.<ref name=\"Swaby-\">{{Cite journal| last1 = Swaby | first1 = AN. | last2 = Morgan | first2 = KA. | title = The relationship between childhood sexual abuse and sexual dysfunction in Jamaican adults | journal = J Child Sex Abuse | volume = 18 | issue = 3 | pages = 247\u201366 | year =  2009| doi =  10.1080/10538710902902679| pmid = 19856732 }}</ref>\n\nGenerally, the approach is to focus on the present problem, rather than the abuse itself. Treatment is highly varied and depends on the person's specific issues. For instance, a person with a history of sexual abuse suffering from severe depression would be treated for [[Major depressive disorder|depression]]. However, there is often an emphasis on [[cognitive restructuring]] due to the deep-seated nature of the trauma. Some newer techniques such as [[eye movement desensitization and reprocessing]] (EMDR) have been shown to be effective.<ref>{{Cite journal| last1 = Edmond | first1 = T. | last2 = Rubin | first2 = A. | title = Assessing the long-term effects of EMDR: results from an 18-month follow-up study with adult female survivors of CSA | journal = J Child Sex Abuse | volume = 13 | issue = 1 | pages = 69\u201386 | year = 2004 | doi =  10.1300/J070v13n01_04| pmid = 15353377 }}</ref>\n\nSexual abuse is associated with many sub-clinical behavioral issues as well, including [[re-victimization]] in the teenage years, a bipolar-like switching between sexual compulsion and shut-down, and [[cognitive distortion|distorted thinking]] on the subject of sexual abuse (for instance, that it is common and happens to everyone).  When first presenting for treatment, the patient can be fully aware of their abuse as an event, but their ''appraisal'' of it is often distorted, such as believing that the event was unremarkable (a form of [[Isolation (psychology)|isolation]]). Frequently, victims do not make the connection between their abuse and their present pathology.\n\n==Prevention==\nChild sexual abuse prevention programmes were developed in the United States of America during the 1970s.

By 1968 44 out of 50 U.S. states had enacted mandatory laws that required physicians to report cases of suspicious child abuse. Legal action began to become more prevalent in the 1970s with the enactment of the [[Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act]] in 1974 in conjunction with the creation of the National Center for Child Abuse and Neglect. Since the creation of the Child Abuse and Treatment Act, reported child abuse cases have increased dramatically.  Finally, the [[National Abuse Coalition]] was created in 1979 to create pressure in congress to create more sexual abuse laws.\n\n[[Second wave feminism]] brought greater awareness of child sexual abuse and [[violence against women]], and made them public, political issues.<ref>{{citation | last1 = Reavey | first1 = Paula | last2 = Warner | first2 = Sam | contribution = Introduction | editor-last1 = Reavey | editor-first1 = Paula | editor-last2 = Warner | editor-first2 = Sam | title = New feminist stories of child sexual abuse: sexual scripts and dangerous dialogues | page = 2 | publisher = New York Routledge | location = London | year = 2003 | isbn = 9780415259446 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=obHkvCPnos0C&pg=PA2 Preview.]</ref><ref>{{citation | last = Valentich | first = Mary | contribution = Feminist theory and social work practice (child sexual abuse) | editor-last = Turner | editor-first = Francis J. | title = Social work treatment: interlocking theoretical approaches | page = 215 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = New York | year = 2011 | isbn = 9780195394658 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=x_k8Aptn6tEC&pg=PA215 Preview.]</ref> [[Judith Lewis Herman]], Harvard professor of psychiatry, wrote the first book ever on father-daughter incest when she discovered during her medical residency that a large number of the women she was seeing had been victims of father-daughter incest.

The number of laws created in the 1980s and 1990s began to create greater prosecution and detection of child sexual abusers. During the 1970s a large transition began in the legislature related to child sexual abuse. [[Megan's Law]] which was enacted in 1996 gives the public access to knowledge of sex offenders nationwide.<ref name=wright>{{cite book|last1=Wright|first1=Ph.D Richard G.|title=Sex offender laws : failed policies, new directions|date=2014|publisher=Springer Publishing Co Inc|isbn=9780826196712|pages=50\u201365|edition=Second|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Ms75AwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref>\n\nAnne Hastings described these changes in attitudes towards child sexual abuse as \"the beginning of one of history's largest social revolutions.\"<ref>''From Generation to Generation: Understanding Sexual Attraction to Children'', p.15</ref>\n\nAccording to John Jay College of Criminal Justice professor B.J. Cling,\n\n<blockquote>\"By the early 21st century, the issue of child sexual abuse has become a legitimate focus of professional attention, while increasingly separated from second wave feminism...As child sexual abuse becomes absorbed into the larger field of interpersonal trauma studies, child sexual abuse studies and intervention strategies have become degendered and largely unaware of their political origins in modern feminism and other vibrant political movements of the 1970s. One may hope that unlike in the past, this rediscovery of child sexual abuse that began in the 70s will not again be followed by collective amnesia. The institutionalization of child maltreatment interventions in federally funded centers, national and international societies, and a host of research studies (in which the United States continues to lead the world) offers grounds for cautious optimism. Nevertheless, as Judith Herman argues cogently, 'The systematic study of psychological trauma...depends on the support of a political movement.'\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Sexualized Violence Against Women and Children: A Psychology and Law Perspective|author=B.J.

Increased awareness of child sexual abuse has encouraged more victims to come forward, whereas in the past victims often kept their abuse secret. Some states have enacted specific [[laws]] lengthening the applicable [[statutes of limitations]] so as to allow victims of child sexual abuse to file suit sometimes years after they have reached the age of majority.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ncsl.org/research/human-services/state-civil-statutes-of-limitations-in-child-sexua.aspx|title=State Civil Statutes of Limitations in Child Sexual Abuse Cases|last=Legislatures|first=National Conference of State|website=www.ncsl.org|access-date=2017-10-18}}</ref>  Such lawsuits can be brought where a person or entity, such as a school, church or youth organization, or daycare was charged with supervising the child but failed to do so with child sexual abuse resulting, making the individual or institution liable.  In the [[Catholic sex abuse cases]] the various [[Roman Catholic]] Diocese in the [[United States]] have paid out approximately $1 billion settling hundreds of such lawsuits since the early 1990s.  There have also been lawsuits involving the American [[Christian right|Religious Right]].  Crimes have allegedly gone unreported and victims were pressured into silence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailykos.com/story/2013/05/25/1211671/-The-Church-Child-Sex-Abuse-Scandal-Widens-and-Deepens|title=The Church Child Sex Abuse Scandal Widens and Deepens|work=dailykos.com|accessdate=23 March 2015}}</ref>\nAs lawsuits can involve demanding procedures there is a concern that [[children]] or adults who file suit will be re-victimized by defendants through the [[legal process]], much as [[rape]] victims can be re-victimized by the accused in [[criminal]] rape trials.  The child sexual abuse plaintiff's attorney [[Thomas A. Cifarelli]] has written that children involved in the legal system, particularly victims of sexual abuse and molestation, should be afforded certain procedural safeguards to protect them from harassment during the legal process.<ref>Cifarelli, T.A.,''Shielding Minors'', Los Angeles Daily Journal, (October 10, 2001).</ref>\n\nIn June 2008 in [[Zambia]] the issue of teacher-student sexual abuse and sexual assault was brought to the attention of the High Court of Zambia where a landmark case decision, with presiding Judge Philip Musonda, awarded $45million Zambian kwacha (US$13,000) to the plaintiff, a 13-year-old girl for sexual abuse and rape by her school teacher. This claim was brought against her teacher as a \"person of authority\" who, as Judge Musonda stated, \"had a moral superiority (responsibility) over his students\" at the time.<ref>[http://womennewsnetwork.net/2008/08/11/rapecasezambia-articl804/ \"When A Girl Student Stands Up and Wins\"], ''Women News Network'' \u2013 WNN, August 11, 2008</ref>\n\nA 2000 World Health Organization \u2013 Geneva report, \u201cWorld Report on Violence and Health (Chap 6 \u2013 Sexual Violence)\u201d states, \u201cAction in schools is vital for reducing sexual and other forms of violence. In many countries a sexual relation between a teacher and a pupil is not a serious disciplinary offence and policies on sexual harassment in schools either do not exist or are not implemented. In recent years, though, some countries have introduced laws prohibiting sexual relations between teachers and pupils. Such measures are important in helping eradicate sexual harassment in schools. At the same time, a wider range of actions is also needed, including changes to teacher training and recruitment and reforms of curricula, so as to transform gender relations in schools.\u201d<ref>[http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2002/9241545615_chap6_eng.pdf World Health Organization Report on Sexual Violence], 2002</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=18em|\n* [[Abusive power and control]]\n*[[Joseph Calasanz#Disgrace and Death|17th-century sexual molestation at Naples school]]\n*[[Bacha Bazi]]\n*[[Betrayal Trauma]]\n*[[List of child abuse cases featuring long-term detention#Cases of children imprisoned by relatives|Cases of children imprisoned by relatives]]\n*[[Catholic Church sex abuse cases]]\n*[[Child erotica]]\n*[[Child Exploitation Tracking System]] (CETS)\n*[[Child marriage]]\n*[[Child-on-child sexual abuse]]\n*[[Child pornography]]\n*[[Child sex tourism]]\n*[[Child sexual abuse in Nigeria]]\n*[[Child welfare]]\n*[[United States Children's Bureau|Children's Bureau]]\n*[[Commercial sexual exploitation of children]]\n*[[Complex post-traumatic stress disorder]]\n*[[False allegation of child sexual abuse]]\n*[[Institutional abuse]]\n*[[Isolation to facilitate abuse]]\n*The [[International Centre for Missing & Exploited Children]] (ICMEC) combats child sexual exploitation, child pornography, and child abduction.\n*[[National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children]] \u2013 a UK organisation set up to combat child abuse, gained controversy in the 1980s\u20131990s over its dealings with [[Satanic ritual abuse]] amongst children.\n*[[Online predator]]\n*[[Penn State child sex abuse scandal]]\n*[[Prostitution of children]]\n*[[Protect (political organization)|Protect]]\n*[[Sexual harassment in education#Sexual harassment and abuse of students by teachers|Sexual harassment and abuse of students by teachers]]\n*[[Statutory rape]]\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{Cite book |author=Lew, Mike |title=Victims No Longer: The Classic Guide for Men Recovering from Sexual Child Abuse |edition=2nd |publisher=Perennial Currents |location= |year=2004 |pages= |isbn=978-0-06-053026-6 |oclc= |doi= |url=https://archive.org/details/victimsnolongerc00lewm }}\n*{{Cite book|author=Cynthia Crosson-Tower |title=Understanding child abuse and neglect |publisher=Pearson/Allyn & Bacon |location=Boston |year=2008 |pages= |isbn=978-0-205-50326-1 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}\n*{{Cite journal|author=Asa Don Brown |title=Posttraumatic stress disorder in childhood|url=http://family-marriage-counseling.com/mentalhealth/posttraumatic-stress-disorder-childhood.htm |publisher=Family and Marriage Counseling, FMC |location=New Orleans |year=2009}}\n*{{Cite journal| last = Lascaratos | first = J |author2=Ascaratos J |author3=Poulakou-Rebelakou, E | year = 2000 | title = Child Sexual abuse: Historical cases in the Byzantine Empire (324\u20131453 A.D.) | journal = Child Abuse & Neglect | volume = 24 | issue = 8 | pages = 1085\u20131090 | doi = 10.1016/S0145-2134(00)00156-3 | pmid = 10983818 }}\n*{{Cite journal| last = Durkin | first = KF |author2=Clifton DB | year = 1999 | title = Propagandizing pederasty: A thematic analysis of the on-line exculpatory accounts of unrepentant pedophiles | journal = Deviant Behavior | volume = 20 | issue = 2 | pages = 103\u2013127 | doi = 10.1080/016396299266524}}\n*{{Cite book|author=Zimring, Franklin E. |title=An American Travesty: Legal Responses to Adolescent Sexual Offending |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=2009 |pages= |isbn=978-0-226-98358-5}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Child sexual abuse}}\n*{{cite web|url=http://www.aacap.org/App_Themes/AACAP/docs/facts_for_families/09_child_sexual_abuse.pdf|title=American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Facts for Families: Child Sexual Abuse|publisher=American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry}}\n*{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11368470|title=Men who molest their sexually immature daughters: Is a special explanation required?|publisher=Research Gate}}\n*{{curlie|Society/Issues/Children,_Youth_and_Family/Child_Abuse/Sexual_Abuse/|Child Abuse: Sexual Abuse}}\n*{{cite web|url=https://www.d2l.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/all_statistics_20150619.pdf|title=Child sexual abuse statistics|publisher=Darkness to Light}}\n* [https://youniquefoundation.org/learn-the-facts/ Learn the Facts of Child Sexual Abuse] The Younique Foundation\n* [https://defendinnocence.org/get-the-facts/ Get the Facts] Defend Innocence\n\n{{Sexual ethics}}\n{{Sexual abuse}}\n{{abuse}}\n{{Pedophilia}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Child Sexual Abuse}}\n[[Category:Child sexual abuse| ]]\n[[Category:Human sexuality]]\n", "name_user": "Flyer22 Frozen", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eAsia", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_sexual_abuse"}

Not only is real-time RT-PCR now the method of choice for quantification of gene expression, it is also the preferred method of obtaining results from [[Microarray analysis techniques|array analyses]] and gene expressions on a global scale. Currently, there are four different fluorescent DNA probes available for the real-time RT-PCR detection of PCR products: [[SYBR Green]], [[TaqMan]], [[molecular beacon]]s, and [[scorpion probe]]s. All of these probes allow the detection of PCR products by generating a fluorescent signal. While the SYBR Green dye emits its fluorescent signal simply by binding to the double-stranded DNA in solution, the TaqMan probes', molecular beacons' and scorpions' generation of fluorescence depend on [[F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer|F\u00f6rster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET)]] coupling of the dye molecule and a quencher moiety to the oligonucleotide substrates.<ref>{{Cite book | last1 = Holden | first1 = M.

The intensity of the fluorescence increases as the PCR products accumulate. This technique is easy to use since designing of probes is not necessary given lack of specificity of its binding. However, since the dye does not discriminate the double-stranded DNA from the PCR products and those from the primer-dimers, overestimation of the target concentration is a common problem. Where accurate quantification is an absolute necessity, further assay for the validation of results must be performed. Nevertheless, among the real-time RT-PCR product detection methods, SYBR Green is the most economical and easiest to use.<ref name=\"pmid11017702\"/><ref name=\"pmid11227069\"/>\n[[File:Taqman.png|thumb|Taqman probes]]\n; [[TaqMan]] probes: TaqMan probes are oligonucleotides that have a fluorescent probe attached to the 5' end and a quencher to the 3' end. During PCR amplification, these probes will hybridize to the target sequences located in the [[amplicon]] and as polymerase replicates the template with TaqMan bound, it also cleaves the fluorescent probe due to polymerase 5'- nuclease activity. Because the close proximity between the quench molecule and the fluorescent probe normally prevents fluorescence from being detected through FRET, the decoupling results in the increase of intensity of fluorescence proportional to the number of the probe cleavage cycles. Although well-designed TaqMan probes produce accurate real-time RT-PCR results, it is expensive and time-consuming to synthesize when separate probes must be made for each mRNA target analyzed.<ref name=\"pmid11017702\"/><ref name=\"pmid18645596\"/><ref name=\"pmid15613819\">{{cite journal  |vauthors=Yang DK, Kweon CH, Kim BH, etal |title=TaqMan reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction for the detection of Japanese encephalitis virus |journal=J.

However, whereas the TaqMan fluorescent probes are cleaved during amplification, molecular beacon probes remain intact and rebind to a new target during each reaction cycle. When free in solution, the close proximity of the fluorescent probe and the quencher molecule prevents fluorescence through FRET. However, when molecular beacon probes hybridize to a target, the fluorescent dye and the quencher are separated resulting in the emittance of light upon excitation.

Not only is real-time RT-PCR now the method of choice for quantification of gene expression, it is also the preferred method of obtaining results from [[Microarray analysis techniques|array analyses]] and gene expressions on a global scale. Currently, there are four different fluorescent DNA probes available for the real-time RT-PCR detection of PCR products: [[SYBR Green]], [[TaqMan]], [[molecular beacon]]s, and [[scorpion probe]]s. All of these probes allow the detection of PCR products by generating a fluorescent signal. While the SYBR Green dye emits its fluorescent signal simply by binding to the double-stranded DNA in solution, the TaqMan probes', molecular beacons' and scorpions' generation of fluorescence depend on [[F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer|F\u00f6rster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET)]] coupling of the dye molecule and a quencher moiety to the oligonucleotide substrates.<ref>{{Cite book | last1 = Holden | first1 = M.

The intensity of the fluorescence increases as the PCR products accumulate. This technique is easy to use since designing of probes is not necessary given lack of specificity of its binding. However, since the dye does not discriminate the double-stranded DNA from the PCR products and those from the primer-dimers, overestimation of the target concentration is a common problem. Where accurate quantification is an absolute necessity, further assay for the validation of results must be performed. Nevertheless, among the real-time RT-PCR product detection methods, SYBR Green is the most economical and easiest to use.<ref name=\"pmid11017702\"/><ref name=\"pmid11227069\"/>\n[[File:Taqman.png|thumb|Taqman probes]]\n; [[TaqMan]] probes: TaqMan probes are oligonucleotides that have a fluorescent probe attached to the 5' end and a quencher to the 3' end. During PCR amplification, these probes will hybridize to the target sequences located in the [[amplicon]] and as polymerase replicates the template with TaqMan bound, it also cleaves the fluorescent probe due to polymerase 5'- nuclease activity. Because the close proximity between the quench molecule and the fluorescent probe normally prevents fluorescence from being detected through FRET, the decoupling results in the increase of intensity of fluorescence proportional to the number of the probe cleavage cycles. Although well-designed TaqMan probes produce accurate real-time RT-PCR results, it is expensive and time-consuming to synthesize when separate probes must be made for each mRNA target analyzed.<ref name=\"pmid11017702\"/><ref name=\"pmid18645596\"/><ref name=\"pmid15613819\">{{cite journal  |vauthors=Yang DK, Kweon CH, Kim BH, etal |title=TaqMan reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction for the detection of Japanese encephalitis virus |journal=J.

However, whereas the TaqMan fluorescent probes are cleaved during amplification, molecular beacon probes remain intact and rebind to a new target during each reaction cycle. When free in solution, the close proximity of the fluorescent probe and the quencher molecule prevents fluorescence through FRET. However, when molecular beacon probes hybridize to a target, the fluorescent dye and the quencher are separated resulting in the emittance of light upon excitation. As is with the TaqMan probes, molecular beacons are expensive to synthesize and require separate probes for each RNA target.<ref name=\"pmid16060372\"/>\n; [[Scorpion probe]]s: The scorpion probes, like molecular beacons, will not be fluorescent active in an unhybridized state, again, due to the fluorescent probe on the 5' end being quenched by the moiety on the 3' end of an oligonucleotide. With Scorpions, however, the 3' end also contains sequence that is complementary to the extension product of the primer on the 5' end. When the Scorpion extension binds to its complement on the amplicon, the Scorpion structure opens, prevents FRET, and enables the fluorescent signal to be measured.<ref name=\"pmid15240248\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Sharkey FH, Banat IM, Marchant R |title=Detection and quantification of gene expression in environmental bacteriology |journal=Appl.

For example, Lin et al. used qRT-PCR to measure expression of Gal genes in yeast cells. First, Lin et al. engineered a mutation of a protein suspected to participate in the regulation of Gal genes. This mutation was hypothesized to selectively abolish Gal expression. To confirm this, gene expression levels of yeast cells containing this mutation were analyzed using qRT-PCR.

It is the fourth installment in the ''[[Devil May Cry]]'' series and is written by [[Bingo Morihashi]] and directed by [[Hideaki Itsuno]]. The story follows [[Nero (Devil May Cry)|Nero]], a teenager possessing demonic powers who is on a mission to stop the series' main character, [[Dante (Devil May Cry)|Dante]], after he assassinates demons and the leader of the Order of the Sword. The player controls both Nero and Dante as they fight enemies in close combat using firearms, swords, and other weapons.\n\n''Devil May Cry 4'' is the first entry in the series to be released simultaneously for multiple consoles. During its development, Capcom focused on each version achieving the same visual quality using the [[MT Framework]] [[game engine]]. Around eighty people formed the team that created the game. Nero was introduced to attract new gamers. Dante's popularity with gamers proved challenging because the developers needed to use him as a supporting character in the story.\n\nCritical reception to ''Devil May Cry 4'' was positive. It was praised for its challenging difficulty, its visuals and Nero's characterization as a new protagonist. However, it was criticized for its backtracking in Dante's stages and a troublesome camera. The game sold over three million units worldwide, becoming the series' best-selling title. Bingo Morihashi adapted it into a two-volume [[light novel]].\n\nIt was released on [[iOS]] as ''Devil May Cry 4: Refrain'' in February 2011. A remastered version of the game was released in June 2015 as ''[[Devil May Cry 4: Special Edition]]'' which adds both English and Japanese voice tracks, improved visual effects and textures, in-game re-balancing, additional costumes, and three bonus playable characters: Vergil, Lady and Trish.\n\n==Gameplay==\nGameplay in ''Devil May Cry 4'' is like previous games in the series. The player must fight through levels called \"missions\", occasionally solving puzzles or gathering items. Performance in a mission is graded from \"D\", the lowest grade, to \"A\" then \"S\", \"SS\", and \"SSS\", the highest grade. Grades are based on items used, Red Orbs gathered, time taken, and the number of Style Points accumulated. Each Style Point grade has its own tag-word. The stylish grade shows up on the side of the screen and begins at \"Deadly\" (D); progresses through \"Carnage\" (C), \"Brutal\" (B), and \"Atomic\" (A); then, advances through one last bar of grades containing the phrases \"Smokin'\" (S), \"Smokin' Style\" (SS), and lastly \"Smokin' Sick Style\" (SSS). Stylish combat is the focus of the game, conveyed through unbroken combos of varied attacks while avoiding damage. The player must avoid enemy attacks to continue performing combos, often by memorizing attack patterns.<ref name=\"guide\">{{cite book|title=Devil May Cry 4: Prima Official Game Guide|publisher= Prima Games|date=2008-02-05|isbn=0-7615-5897-7}}</ref> The Devil Trigger is a super state that enables the player to become more powerful adding a slow but steady health regeneration, with increased damage done. Devil Trigger can be activated by pressing the button to trigger it when the minimum amount on the gauge is filled.<ref name=\"guide\" />\n\nSome changes introduced in ''Devil May Cry 4'' are the presence of two playable characters, [[Dante (Devil May Cry)|Dante]] and [[Nero (Devil May Cry)|Nero]], and a slight modification to the shop system. A new currency, Proud Souls, is used to buy new abilities while Red Orbs are used to buy items. Proud Souls are rewarded at the end of missions; the amount varies depending on how well the player performed. The cost of abilities increases with the purchase of other abilities, though all abilities can be sold back for their original price.<ref name=\"guide\" />\n\n[[File:DevilBringerfirstmission.png|thumb|right|Nero uses his Devil Bringer ability to parry Dante's attack. The green bar at the top shows Nero's health while the yellow one shows Dante's.]]\nThe player plays as Nero throughout most of the game. He is equipped with the Red Queen sword, Blue Rose revolver, and the powers of his Devil Bringer. The Red Queen features an Exceed Gauge that can be charged up, allowing for subsequent attacks that are more powerful than regular slashes, until the gauge empties. Nero also has the powers of his Devil Bringer and can use it to pull himself towards enemies or vice versa. The Devil Bringer may also be used for context-sensitive throw attacks, leading to high damage and various effects depending on the enemy. Nero's Devil Bringer also gains new abilities during the game, including being able to detect secret missions or caches of Red Orbs. Nero eventually gains the ability to use Devil Trigger after getting the ''[[katana]]'' known as Yamato. This increases his Devil Bringer's power changing its attacks into more powerful versions with different animations.<ref name=\"guide\" />\n\nThe player plays as Dante through seven missions, taking over halfway through the game. His gameplay is like that in ''Devil May Cry 3''. He has access to multiple melee and ranged weapons which he gains after boss battles. He is able to cycle through them freely in combat and is no longer limited to equipping two weapons of each type as he was in the previous game. Dante also begins with his four styles, each of which grants him different abilities. But, unlike in ''Devil May Cry 3'', he may now switch them at will with buttons or pads on the controller.<ref name=\"psm\">{{cite news | last =Hwang  | first =Kaiser  | title =Devil May Cry 4, The PS3's Ruby Red Slipper  | pages =11  | publisher =Independent PlayStation Magazine  |date=May 2007}}</ref> He also gains the Dark Slayer style near the end of his appearance, which only has one style level. Styles do not level up through experience as in the previous game, but instead must be upgraded like other skills in the shop screen in between missions or at statues. Dante can also enter Devil Trigger where he gains most of the benefits that Nero's Devil Trigger has. Since he does not have the Devil Bringer, he gets animation and property changes on some of his normal attacks instead.<ref name=\"guide\" />\n\n==Plot==\n{{Devil May Cry chronology}}\n{{see also|Characters of Devil May Cry}}\nNero, who is a young demon hunter who lives on the isolated island of Fortuna, is also a member of the Order of the Sword: a religious sect of knights who worship the Legendary Dark Knight Sparda as a God. Dante arrives, and murders The Order's leader, the High Priest Sanctus, in front of the entire congregation. At the same time, an army of demons invade the city, putting everyone, including Nero's love interest Kyrie, in danger.

He intends to use a creature known as Savior to defeat the demon army he's created, as a means of strengthening the people's worship of Sparda. With the Sparda Sword already in his possession, and needing the blood of a descendant of Sparda along with the Yamato, Sanctus captures Nero to power The Savior's core.<ref>{{cite video game|title=Devil May Cry 4|publisher=Capcom|developer=Capcom|year=2008|quote='''Sanctus:''' Held back by love.

As previously revealed in the game, it was Lady who sent Dante and Trish to Fortuna in the first place as The Order had begun butting in on some of her jobs, which was why Trish immediately went undercover to expose The Order's true colours.\n\n==Development==\n[[File:Vatican City - main entrance with Swiss Guard.jpg|thumb|Vatican City was one of the main inspirations for the fictional city of Fortuna.]]\nDevelopment of ''Devil May Cry 4'' began shortly after its predecessor was a success.<ref name=\"writing\">{{cite book|title=Devil May Cry: 3142 Graphic Arts|publisher=Capcom, Udon Entertainment|year=2015|isbn=978-1927925485|pages=208}}</ref> A total of eighty people formed the development team.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.videogamesdaily.com/features/dmc4_iv_p3.asp|title=Devil May Cry 4: Kobayashi Interview|date=January 2, 2008|accessdate=August 6, 2018|publisher=Video Games Daily}}</ref> The first teaser, involving Dante doing multiple moves in front of a camera, contained elements that were not included in the finished product.

He collaborated with film director Yuji Shimomura who worked on the earlier games. Morihashi had many issues with the making of the game to the point he quit Capcom. However, after Itsuno's asked him to return, he did so. He finished writing the game's events, which took a year. Morihashi had difficulties with the characterization of Nero, the new protagonist. Dante returned as a supporting character.<ref name=\"writing\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite book|title=Devil May Cry: 3142 Graphic Arts|publisher=Capcom, Udon Entertainment|year=2015|isbn=978-1927925485|pages=209}}</ref> Itsuno was responsible for most of Kyrie's elements. She was envisioned as an \"ordinary, cute heroine\" who had a big impact on Nero despite not being a fighter. Her role was to motivate Nero and the player as the story progresses.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nThe writings of late manga artist [[Ramo Nakajima]] in the series ''[[Amagasaki City]]'' inspired Morihashi to write Nero's story; \"I love you, so I protect the city you love.\" Love is the focus of the ''Devil May Cry'' series; ''Devil May Cry 4'' focuses on Nero's love for Kyrie. While ''Devil May Cry 4'' is a simple story similar to Hollywood movies involving a [[damsel in distress]], the staff were satisfied with it because it also carried Morihashi's ideas well.<ref>{{cite book|title=Devil May Cry: 3142 Graphic Arts|publisher=Capcom, Udon Entertainment|year=2015|isbn=978-1927925485|pages=211}}</ref> The Capcom staff created Nero as a new protagonist who would develop across the ''Devil May Cry'' series because Dante had become stronger with each game. Nero was created as a weaker character who develops new powers as the story progresses until he reaches Dante's level. This was done mostly through his \"Devil Bringer\" ability, which makes him stand out. Another reason for Nero's introduction was to attract new gamers to the franchise.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gamesradar.com/devil-may-cry-4-interview-the-men-behind-the-mayhem/4/|title=Devil May Cry 4 interview - the men behind the mayhem|publisher=GamesRadar|accessdate=June 22, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180623061209/https://www.gamesradar.com/devil-may-cry-4-interview-the-men-behind-the-mayhem/4/|archive-date=June 23, 2018|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nBefore commencing the designs for the characters in ''Devil May Cry 4'', character designer Tatsuya Yoshikawa consulted with several members of the staff who had worked on the series before to become familiar with previous elements. The characters were designed to emphasize their moves, which made the staff controlling their motions vital to the design.<ref name=\"very long interview\"/> Some of the antagonist's demonic forms in ''Devil May Cry 4'' resemble angels. These characters were designed to be attractive to the game's audience while providing a contrast when compared to other demons in the game.<ref name=\"very long interview\"/> Yoshikawa noted that several of the boss characters presented some difficulty when creating them. He said that Nero's design was one of the biggest challenges he had experienced in his career, because the character had to be accepted by the public and fit in the series' universe.<ref name=\"very long interview\"/> Yoshikawa liked the interactions between Nero and Dante because of the balance the two playable characters make.<ref>{{cite book|title=Devil May Cry: 3142 Graphic Arts|publisher=Capcom, Udon Entertainment|year=2015|isbn=978-1927925485|pages=217}}</ref>\n\nYoshikawa also created another devil transformation, the Devil Trigger, for Nero. Unlike Dante's transformation that makes him look like a devil, Nero's Devil Trigger generates a creature situated behind his back. One that did not appear in the game turned Nero into a demon like Dante. Nero's hood covers one eye as a symbol whose interpretation is left up to the fans. Yoshikawa wanted to incorporate this into the game and hoped to make it into a figurine, but this was not possible.<ref>{{cite book|title=Devil May Cry 4 Devil's Material Collection Art Book|publisher=Capcom|isbn=978-4862331854|year=2008|page=31}}</ref>\n\nBoth main voice actors motion capture actors, Reuben Langdon and Bosch, expressed pleasure working as Dante and Nero, respectively with the former noting he made Dante like his younger ''Devil May Cry 3'' persona but more mature. Langdon's inspiration for the character was [[Roy Focker]] of the anime series ''[[The Super Dimension Fortress Macross]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.halfkorean.com/?page_id=379 |title= Interview with Johnny Yong Bosch |publisher= HalfKorean.com |accessdate= June 22, 2018 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20180623032926/http://www.halfkorean.com/?page_id=379 |archive-date= June 23, 2018 |url-status= live |df= mdy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"YouTube\">{{cite web|author=Langdon, Reuben |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8ySzx_fmjk |title=DMC4 Nero |publisher=Youtube |date=14 January 2013 |accessdate=30 May 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140625221956/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8ySzx_fmjk |archivedate=25 June 2014 }}</ref>\n\n===Music===\nThe soundtrack for ''Devil May Cry 4'' was composed by [[Tetsuya Shibata]], Shusaku Uchiyama, Kento Hasegawa, Akihiko Narita, Kota Suzuki, Rei Kondoh, Masayoshi \"Chamy\" Ishi, Masami Ueda and [[Shinichiro Sato]].<ref name=\"dmc4ost\">{{cite AV media notes |url=http://vgmdb.net/album/6366 |title=Devil May Cry 4 Original Soundtrack |year=2008 |publisher=[[Suleputer]] |accessdate=January 23, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111121174717/http://vgmdb.net/album/6366 |archivedate=November 21, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref> Shibata said that since the release of ''Devil May Cry 3'' he had wanted to emphasized lyrics in the fourth title.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.squareenixmusic.com/features/interviews/tetsuyashibata.shtml|title=Interview with Tetsuya Shibata (October 2009)|publisher=Square Enix Music|accessdate=August 6, 2018}}</ref> The game is noted for its use of heavy metal songs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vgmonline.net/original-composers-return-for-devil-may-cry-rockmetal-arrange/|title=Original composers return for Devil May Cry rock/metal arrange|publisher=VGM Online|accessdate=August 7, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190328192357/http://www.vgmonline.net/original-composers-return-for-devil-may-cry-rockmetal-arrange/|archive-date=March 28, 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n''Devil May Cry 4 Original Soundtrack'' in a three-disc, 104 track soundtrack.

It is the fourth installment in the ''[[Devil May Cry]]'' series and is written by [[Bingo Morihashi]] and directed by [[Hideaki Itsuno]]. The story follows [[Nero (Devil May Cry)|Nero]], a teenager possessing demonic powers who is on a mission to stop the series' main character, [[Dante (Devil May Cry)|Dante]], after he assassinates demons and the leader of the Order of the Sword. The player controls both Nero and Dante as they fight enemies in close combat using firearms, swords, and other weapons.\n\n''Devil May Cry 4'' is the first entry in the series to be released simultaneously for multiple consoles. During its development, Capcom focused on each version achieving the same visual quality using the [[MT Framework]] [[game engine]]. Around eighty people formed the team that created the game. Nero was introduced to attract new gamers. Dante's popularity with gamers proved challenging because the developers needed to use him as a supporting character in the story.\n\nCritical reception to ''Devil May Cry 4'' was positive. It was praised for its challenging difficulty, its visuals and Nero's characterization as a new protagonist. However, it was criticized for its backtracking in Dante's stages and a troublesome camera. The game sold over three million units worldwide, becoming the series' best-selling title. Bingo Morihashi adapted it into a two-volume [[light novel]].\n\nIt was released on [[iOS]] as ''Devil May Cry 4: Refrain'' in February 2011. A remastered version of the game was released in June 2015 as ''[[Devil May Cry 4: Special Edition]]'' which adds both English and Japanese voice tracks, improved visual effects and textures, in-game re-balancing, additional costumes, and three bonus playable characters: Vergil, Lady and Trish.\n\n==Gameplay==\nGameplay in ''Devil May Cry 4'' is like previous games in the series. The player must fight through levels called \"missions\", occasionally solving puzzles or gathering items. Performance in a mission is graded from \"D\", the lowest grade, to \"A\" then \"S\", \"SS\", and \"SSS\", the highest grade. Grades are based on items used, Red Orbs gathered, time taken, and the number of Style Points accumulated. Each Style Point grade has its own tag-word. The stylish grade shows up on the side of the screen and begins at \"Deadly\" (D); progresses through \"Carnage\" (C), \"Brutal\" (B), and \"Atomic\" (A); then, advances through one last bar of grades containing the phrases \"Smokin'\" (S), \"Smokin' Style\" (SS), and lastly \"Smokin' Sick Style\" (SSS). Stylish combat is the focus of the game, conveyed through unbroken combos of varied attacks while avoiding damage. The player must avoid enemy attacks to continue performing combos, often by memorizing attack patterns.<ref name=\"guide\">{{cite book|title=Devil May Cry 4: Prima Official Game Guide|publisher= Prima Games|date=2008-02-05|isbn=0-7615-5897-7}}</ref> The Devil Trigger is a super state that enables the player to become more powerful adding a slow but steady health regeneration, with increased damage done. Devil Trigger can be activated by pressing the button to trigger it when the minimum amount on the gauge is filled.<ref name=\"guide\" />\n\nSome changes introduced in ''Devil May Cry 4'' are the presence of two playable characters, [[Dante (Devil May Cry)|Dante]] and [[Nero (Devil May Cry)|Nero]], and a slight modification to the shop system. A new currency, Proud Souls, is used to buy new abilities while Red Orbs are used to buy items. Proud Souls are rewarded at the end of missions; the amount varies depending on how well the player performed. The cost of abilities increases with the purchase of other abilities, though all abilities can be sold back for their original price.<ref name=\"guide\" />\n\n[[File:DevilBringerfirstmission.png|thumb|right|Nero uses his Devil Bringer ability to parry Dante's attack. The green bar at the top shows Nero's health while the yellow one shows Dante's.]]\nThe player plays as Nero throughout most of the game. He is equipped with the Red Queen sword, Blue Rose revolver, and the powers of his Devil Bringer. The Red Queen features an Exceed Gauge that can be charged up, allowing for subsequent attacks that are more powerful than regular slashes, until the gauge empties. Nero also has the powers of his Devil Bringer and can use it to pull himself towards enemies or vice versa. The Devil Bringer may also be used for context-sensitive throw attacks, leading to high damage and various effects depending on the enemy. Nero's Devil Bringer also gains new abilities during the game, including being able to detect secret missions or caches of Red Orbs. Nero eventually gains the ability to use Devil Trigger after getting the ''[[katana]]'' known as Yamato. This increases his Devil Bringer's power changing its attacks into more powerful versions with different animations.<ref name=\"guide\" />\n\nThe player plays as Dante through seven missions, taking over halfway through the game. His gameplay is like that in ''Devil May Cry 3''. He has access to multiple melee and ranged weapons which he gains after boss battles. He is able to cycle through them freely in combat and is no longer limited to equipping two weapons of each type as he was in the previous game. Dante also begins with his four styles, each of which grants him different abilities. But, unlike in ''Devil May Cry 3'', he may now switch them at will with buttons or pads on the controller.<ref name=\"psm\">{{cite news | last =Hwang  | first =Kaiser  | title =Devil May Cry 4, The PS3's Ruby Red Slipper  | pages =11  | publisher =Independent PlayStation Magazine  |date=May 2007}}</ref> He also gains the Dark Slayer style near the end of his appearance, which only has one style level. Styles do not level up through experience as in the previous game, but instead must be upgraded like other skills in the shop screen in between missions or at statues. Dante can also enter Devil Trigger where he gains most of the benefits that Nero's Devil Trigger has. Since he does not have the Devil Bringer, he gets animation and property changes on some of his normal attacks instead.<ref name=\"guide\" />\n\n==Plot==\n{{Devil May Cry chronology}}\n{{see also|Characters of Devil May Cry}}\nNero, who is a young demon hunter who lives on the isolated island of Fortuna, is also a member of the Order of the Sword: a religious sect of knights who worship the Legendary Dark Knight Sparda as a God.

He collaborated with film director Yuji Shimomura who worked on the earlier games. Morihashi had many issues with the making of the game to the point he quit Capcom. However, after Itsuno's asked him to return, he did so. He finished writing the game's events, which took a year. Morihashi had difficulties with the characterization of Nero, the new protagonist. Dante returned as a supporting character.<ref name=\"writing\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite book|title=Devil May Cry: 3142 Graphic Arts|publisher=Capcom, Udon Entertainment|year=2015|isbn=978-1927925485|pages=209}}</ref> Itsuno was responsible for most of Kyrie's elements. She was envisioned as an \"ordinary, cute heroine\" who had a big impact on Nero despite not being a fighter. Her role was to motivate Nero and the player as the story progresses.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nThe writings of late manga artist [[Ramo Nakajima]] in the series ''[[Amagasaki City]]'' inspired Morihashi to write Nero's story; \"I love you, so I protect the city you love.\" Love is the focus of the ''Devil May Cry'' series; ''Devil May Cry 4'' focuses on Nero's love for Kyrie. While ''Devil May Cry 4'' is a simple story similar to Hollywood movies involving a [[damsel in distress]], the staff were satisfied with it because it also carried Morihashi's ideas well.<ref>{{cite book|title=Devil May Cry: 3142 Graphic Arts|publisher=Capcom, Udon Entertainment|year=2015|isbn=978-1927925485|pages=211}}</ref> The Capcom staff created Nero as a new protagonist who would develop across the ''Devil May Cry'' series because Dante had become stronger with each game. Nero was created as a weaker character who develops new powers as the story progresses until he reaches Dante's level. This was done mostly through his \"Devil Bringer\" ability, which makes him stand out. Another reason for Nero's introduction was to attract new gamers to the franchise.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gamesradar.com/devil-may-cry-4-interview-the-men-behind-the-mayhem/4/|title=Devil May Cry 4 interview - the men behind the mayhem|publisher=GamesRadar|accessdate=June 22, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180623061209/https://www.gamesradar.com/devil-may-cry-4-interview-the-men-behind-the-mayhem/4/|archive-date=June 23, 2018|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nBefore commencing the designs for the characters in ''Devil May Cry 4'', character designer Tatsuya Yoshikawa consulted with several members of the staff who had worked on the series before to become familiar with previous elements. The characters were designed to emphasize their moves, which made the staff controlling their motions vital to the design.<ref name=\"very long interview\"/> Some of the antagonist's demonic forms in ''Devil May Cry 4'' resemble angels. These characters were designed to be attractive to the game's audience while providing a contrast when compared to other demons in the game.<ref name=\"very long interview\"/> Yoshikawa noted that several of the boss characters presented some difficulty when creating them. He said that Nero's design was one of the biggest challenges he had experienced in his career, because the character had to be accepted by the public and fit in the series' universe.<ref name=\"very long interview\"/> Yoshikawa liked the interactions between Nero and Dante because of the balance the two playable characters make.<ref>{{cite book|title=Devil May Cry: 3142 Graphic Arts|publisher=Capcom, Udon Entertainment|year=2015|isbn=978-1927925485|pages=217}}</ref>\n\nYoshikawa also created another devil transformation, the Devil Trigger, for Nero. Unlike Dante's transformation that makes him look like a devil, Nero's Devil Trigger generates a creature situated behind his back. One that did not appear in the game turned Nero into a demon like Dante. Nero's hood covers one eye as a symbol whose interpretation is left up to the fans. Yoshikawa wanted to incorporate this into the game and hoped to make it into a figurine, but this was not possible.<ref>{{cite book|title=Devil May Cry 4 Devil's Material Collection Art Book|publisher=Capcom|isbn=978-4862331854|year=2008|page=31}}</ref>\n\nBoth main voice actors motion capture actors, Reuben Langdon and Bosch, expressed pleasure working as Dante and Nero, respectively with the former noting he made Dante like his younger ''Devil May Cry 3'' persona but more mature. Langdon's inspiration for the character was [[Roy Focker]] of the anime series ''[[The Super Dimension Fortress Macross]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.halfkorean.com/?page_id=379 |title= Interview with Johnny Yong Bosch |publisher= HalfKorean.com |accessdate= June 22, 2018 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20180623032926/http://www.halfkorean.com/?page_id=379 |archive-date= June 23, 2018 |url-status= live |df= mdy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"YouTube\">{{cite web|author=Langdon, Reuben |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8ySzx_fmjk |title=DMC4 Nero |publisher=Youtube |date=14 January 2013 |accessdate=30 May 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140625221956/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8ySzx_fmjk |archivedate=25 June 2014 }}</ref>\n\n===Music===\nThe soundtrack for ''Devil May Cry 4'' was composed by [[Tetsuya Shibata]], Shusaku Uchiyama, Kento Hasegawa, Akihiko Narita, Kota Suzuki, Rei Kondoh, Masayoshi \"Chamy\" Ishi, Masami Ueda and [[Shinichiro Sato]].<ref name=\"dmc4ost\">{{cite AV media notes |url=http://vgmdb.net/album/6366 |title=Devil May Cry 4 Original Soundtrack |year=2008 |publisher=[[Suleputer]] |accessdate=January 23, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111121174717/http://vgmdb.net/album/6366 |archivedate=November 21, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref> Shibata said that since the release of ''Devil May Cry 3'' he had wanted to emphasized lyrics in the fourth title.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.squareenixmusic.com/features/interviews/tetsuyashibata.shtml|title=Interview with Tetsuya Shibata (October 2009)|publisher=Square Enix Music|accessdate=August 6, 2018}}</ref> The game is noted for its use of heavy metal songs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vgmonline.net/original-composers-return-for-devil-may-cry-rockmetal-arrange/|title=Original composers return for Devil May Cry rock/metal arrange|publisher=VGM Online|accessdate=August 7, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190328192357/http://www.vgmonline.net/original-composers-return-for-devil-may-cry-rockmetal-arrange/|archive-date=March 28, 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n''Devil May Cry 4 Original Soundtrack'' in a three-disc, 104 track soundtrack.
