He took on the role in 2007 and had a 12-month hiatus between 2008 and 2009 due to the problems relating to his pledging of shares as collateral, which had included those he held in Cosalt itself. Despite selling its marine division to raise \u00a327 million, the company was in dire financial circumstances by 2011, when Ross held 15 per cent of the shares and had loaned it money. Following a profits warning in October, Ross proposed to turn it into a privately owned business, offering \u00a3400,000 to have it delisted from the stock market, where it had had a presence since 1971. Despite doubling his offer and pumping more money into the company through his investment vehicle, disaffected shareholders rejected it. Some individual shareholders tried in December 2012 to have the [[Takeover Panel]] and Financial Services Authority investigate Ross amid claims that he had abused his position in an attempt to buy the business cheaply. Ross said that he had acted altruistically and that the company's pension fund liabilities were now twice its value. By that time, trading in shares had been suspended due to a failure to comply with regulatory requirements by April of that year.<ref>{{cite news |title=Ailing Cosalt may go private |date=18 November 2011 |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/ailing-cosalt-may-go-private-6263971.html?origin=internalSearch |work=The Independent |accessdate=2015-01-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/ross-set-to-take-cosalt-private-with-knockdown-offer-6268174.html?origin=internalSearch |work=The Independent |title=Ross set to take Cosalt private with knockdown offer |first=James |last=Moore |date=26 November 2011 |accessdate=2015-01-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Marine firm investors attack David Ross |date=2 December 2012 |work=The Independent |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/marine-firm-investors-attack-david-ross-8373573.html?origin=internalSearch |accessdate=2015-01-08}}</ref>{{efn|Regulatory issues arose because the inability to resolve refinancing issues meant that the company did not file accounts for the 2011 financial year.

He took on the role in 2007 and had a 12-month hiatus between 2008 and 2009 due to the problems relating to his pledging of shares as collateral, which had included those he held in Cosalt itself. Despite selling its marine division to raise \u00a327 million, the company was in dire financial circumstances by 2011, when Ross held 15 per cent of the shares and had loaned it money. Following a profits warning in October, Ross proposed to turn it into a privately owned business, offering \u00a3400,000 to have it delisted from the stock market, where it had had a presence since 1971. Despite doubling his offer and pumping more money into the company through his investment vehicle, disaffected shareholders rejected it. Some individual shareholders tried in December 2012 to have the [[Takeover Panel]] and Financial Services Authority investigate Ross amid claims that he had abused his position in an attempt to buy the business cheaply. Ross said that he had acted altruistically and that the company's pension fund liabilities were now twice its value. By that time, trading in shares had been suspended due to a failure to comply with regulatory requirements by April of that year.<ref>{{cite news |title=Ailing Cosalt may go private |date=18 November 2011 |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/ailing-cosalt-may-go-private-6263971.html?origin=internalSearch |work=The Independent |accessdate=2015-01-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/ross-set-to-take-cosalt-private-with-knockdown-offer-6268174.html?origin=internalSearch |work=The Independent |title=Ross set to take Cosalt private with knockdown offer |first=James |last=Moore |date=26 November 2011 |accessdate=2015-01-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Marine firm investors attack David Ross |date=2 December 2012 |work=The Independent |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/marine-firm-investors-attack-david-ross-8373573.html?origin=internalSearch |accessdate=2015-01-08}}</ref>{{efn|Regulatory issues arose because the inability to resolve refinancing issues meant that the company did not file accounts for the 2011 financial year.

Prior to the massacre, four to five thousand students from various universities had demonstrated for more than a week against the return of former military dictator [[Thanom Kittikachorn]] to Thailand from [[Singapore]].\n\nA day before the massacre, the Thai press reported on a play staged by student protesters the previous day, which allegedly featured the mock hanging of then [[Vajiralongkorn|Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn]]. In response to this rumored outrage, military and police, as well as paramilitary forces surrounded the university. Just before dawn on 6 October with the protesters trapped within the campus, the government forces opened fire on them. The brutal attack lasted until noon, eventually devolving into chaos with mob beatings, rapes and lynchings.

Thanin and his cabinet restored the repressive climate which had existed before 1973.<ref name=\"Mallet\" />{{RP|91}}\n\n== Significance ==\n\n=== Return of bureaucratic polity ===\nFor forty years from 1932 when the absolute monarchy was abolished, until 1973 when military rule was overthrown in favor of democracy, military officers and civil servants held sway in Thai politics and dominated the government, with King Bhumibol serving as the ceremonial head of state in accordance with his role as a [[Constitutional monarchy|constitutional monarch]] established by the 1932 constitution. The Thai political system was known as a \"bureaucratic [[polity]]\" which was dominated by the military and civilian bureaucrats.<ref>Riggs, Fred (1976). \"The Bureaucratic Polity as a Working System\". In Clark Neher, ed., ''Thailand: From Village to Nation''. Cambridge: Schenkman Books, pp. 406\u2013424.</ref> The massacre disproved the argument that the bureaucratic polity was on the retreat as the military came to play a central role once more in Thai politics, a situation that would continue throughout the 1970s and 1980s until the [[1988 Thai general election|1988 general election]] when all seats were democratically elected, including that of the prime minister, who from 1976 to 1988 was appointed by the king.\n\n=== Withdrawal symptoms ===\nFollowing in the footsteps of previous military strongmen like [[Plaek Phibunsongkhram]] and [[Sarit Thanarat]], Thanom became prime minister in 1963 following Sarit's death. He oversaw a massive influx of financial aid from the United States and Japan, fuelling the Thai economy, as well as increasing American cultural influence. But by the early-1970s, the US was withdrawing its troops from Indochina. In such a context, the Thai middle class and lower-middle class who had supported student efforts in 1973 to topple the Thanom regime were more a product of their immediate history than devotees of democracy.<ref name=\"Anderson\">{{cite journal|last1=Anderson|first1=Ben|title=Withdrawal Symptoms: Social and Cultural Aspects of the October 6 Coup|journal=Bulletin of Concerned Asian Scholars|date=Jul\u2013Sep 1977|volume=9|issue=3|pages=13\u201318|url=http://criticalasianstudies.org/assets/files/bcas/v09n03.pdf|accessdate=5 October 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170106234159/http://criticalasianstudies.org/assets/files/bcas/v09n03.pdf|archive-date=6 January 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>{{RP|18}} They lacked political experience and so had no real idea of the consequences of ending the dictatorship. The regime was simultaneously blamed both for failing to exact fuller commitments from its allies and for excessive subservience to Washington.<ref name=\"Anderson\" />{{RP|18}} The support given by the Thai middle class and lower-middle class to the 1973 student protests was not an unconditional stamp of approval for democratic processes and the chaos that followed. The \"chaotic democracy\" from 1973 to 1976 was seen as having threatened the economic interests of the middle class and lower-middle class who favored stability and peace above democracy. In light of this, while they supported the mass demonstrations against the Thanom regime leading up to the uprising on 14 October 1973, they turned their backs on democracy, hence Anderson's use of the phrase \"withdrawal symptoms\", and welcomed the return to dictatorship on 6 October 1976, heralding the end of the period of chaotic democracy.\n\n== Left-wing Conspiracy Theory ==\n\n=== Overview ===\n{{more citations needed|section|date=October 2017|reason=first paragraph has no citations}}\nDespite being the most popular assumption among left-wing scholars, there are not empirical evidences which concluded that King Bhumibol had supported student protesters in their demonstrations in 1973 that led to the downfall of the Thanom regime and resulted in the period of \"chaotic democracy\" from 1973 to 1976, but had turned against the students and played a crucial, if not the most important, role in bringing about the massacre and a return to military rule after a three-year flirtation with democracy.\n\nAccording to the conspiracy theory, \u201cthere were two reasons for this about-face.\u201d \u201cFirst, Thailand's neighbors either were facing communist insurgencies or had fallen to communist rule and become communist countries.\u201d \u201cThe US was withdrawing its military presence from the region. The pivotal year in the trajectory of the king's involvement in politics was 1975. [[South Vietnam]] fell to the communists and the [[Communist Party of Vietnam]] was able to unify the country under its rule and drive out the US. In Cambodia, the communist [[Khmer Rouge]] [[Fall of Phnom Penh|captured Phnom Penh]] and began a reign of terror that would only end in 1979. The 1975 incident that arguably shook the Thai monarchy to the core was the overthrow by the [[Lao People's Revolutionary Party]] of the [[Lao Royal Family]], to which the Thai monarchy traditionally had cultural and historical ties. Second, the period of chaotic democracy brought instability and chaos as demonstrations, strikes, and protests took place much more frequently. They threatened the economic interests of the monarchy managed by the [[Crown Property Bureau]], which favored a stable and peaceful economic environment that would allow its businesses to thrive.\u201d\n\n\u201cKing Bhumibol wielded his influence through a \"[[network monarchy]]\" that was centered on [[Privy Council of Thailand|Privy Council]] President [[Prem Tinsulanonda]]. One of the main features of the network monarchy was that the monarch intervened actively in political developments, largely by working through proxies such as privy councillors and trusted military figures.<ref>McCargo, Duncan (2005). \"Network Monarchy and Legitimacy Crises\". ''The Pacific Review'', Vol. 18, No. 4, p. 501.</ref> This network monarchy suggests that, contrary to the popular belief that the king was a constitutional monarch and above politics, rather he had been intimately involved in Thai politics and had often intervened in order to secure his political and economic interests. The instability brought about by the student protesters until 1976 as well as the growing specter of communist threat in the region, especially after the \"domino effect\" where Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos fell in succession to the communists, convinced King Bhumibol to see the protesters as a threat to his rule. The Thai state and its politicians subsequently branded these students, as well as workers and farmers, as \"communists\" and a \"fifth column for the [[Communist Party of Thailand]] (CPT) and [[North Vietnam]].\"<ref name=\"Handley-2006\" />{{RP|220}} In reality, there was little evidence for the claim that protesters, including students protesting at Thammasat University, were communists. While the CPT had grown in strength, they were far from a unified force and they appealed to peasants by focusing on social injustices while avoiding attacking the monarchy and Buddhism. Their gains were fuelled more by the government's alienation of the peasantry.<ref name=\"Handley-2006\" />{{RP|220}} This suggests that the term \"communists\" was applied very liberally and indiscriminately and more often than not, deliberately, to those who were deemed to be the sources of instability that threatened the monarchy and the king. In the Thai state's view, communism was simply the enemy of the nation, religion (Buddhism), and monarchy, and a sworn enemy of \"Thainess\".<ref name=Thongchai-1994>Winichakul, Thongchai (1994). ''Siam Mapped: A History of the Geo-Body of Siam''.

This culminated in the Thammasat massacre.\u201d\n\n=== Village Scouts ===\n\u201cThe Village Scouts organization was a national [[paramilitary]] group sponsored by the King and Queen of Thailand since 1972 in order to promote national unity against threats to Thai independence and freedom, particularly against \"communism\".<ref name=Muecke>Muecke, Marjorie (1980). \"The Village Scouts of Thailand\". ''Asian Survey'', Vol. 20, No. 4.</ref>{{RP|407}} The movement was set up explicitly to protect the monarchy from communism. It focused on the central features of Thai identity: love of play, deep respect for the king and religion (Buddhism), and for ethnic Thai \"specialness\".<ref name=\"Muecke\" />{{RP|413}} The king was held to be central to the Thai nation, to be protected at all costs, alongside the nation and religion, forming the Thai nationalist [[shibboleth]], \"nation, religion, king\". The Village Scouts presence provided continuous proof of militant political support for nation-religion-king beyond the Bangkok upper classes, among the \"establishments\" of provincial capitals, small towns, and villages. It helped to legitimize private, localized repression of protesting peasants and student activists as essential for the preservation the status quo.<ref name=\"Anderson\" /> During the period 1973\u20131976, Village Scout membership rose to tens of thousands, almost all in rural, CPT-influenced Thailand. After an [[Internal Security Operations Command]] (ISOC) takeover, the Village Scouts metamorphosed into a [[fascist]]-style mass political movement that would play a major role in the ensuing massacre.<ref name=\"Handley-2006\" />{{RP|224}}\u201d\n\n=== Nawaphon ===\n\u201c[[Nawaphon]] was an ISOC operation organized in 1974. It was composed of mainly low-level government functionaries and clerks, rural village and communal headmen, as well as a number of monks.<ref name=Keyes>Keyes, Charles (1978). \"Political Crisis and Militant Buddhism in Contemporary Thailand\". In Bardwell L. Smith, ed., ''Religion and Legitimation of Power in Thailand, Laos, and Burma''. Chambersburg: Anima Books.</ref>{{RP|151}} The name \"Nawaphon\" means \"nine strengths\", a reference to either the [[Chakri dynasty|Chakri Ninth Reign (King Bhumibol)]]<ref name=\"Handley-2006\" />{{RP|225}} or the nine points of Nawaphon's program to preserve Thai nationalism.<ref name=\"Keyes\" />{{RP|151}} The aim of Nawaphon was to protect the king from threats like communism. A key figure of the movement was the monk, Kittivudho Bhikkhu, who became its leader in 1975. In a June 1976 interview he was asked if killing leftists or communists would produce demerits or negative [[karma]], he said that such killing would not be demeriting because, \"...whoever destroys the nation, the religion or the monarchy, such bestial types are not complete persons. Thus, we must intend not to kill people but to kill the Devil; this is the duty of all Thai\".<ref name=\"Keyes\" />{{RP|153}} In 1967, he established Jittiphawan College. It was inaugurated by King Bhumibol and Queen Sirikit who returned regularly even after Kittivudho began to make incendiary speeches about the need to deal with student protesters and communists.<ref name=\"Handley-2006\" />{{RP|225}} This suggests a close relationship between the Nawaphon movement and the royal family. Employing the slogan that \"killing communists is not demeritorious\", Kittivudho encouraged the killings of alleged communists from 1973 to 1976 and injected militant Buddhism into the Thai [[body politic]], eventually inciting his followers to commit violence at Thammasat University on 6 October. Earlier, Nawaphon was responsible for the killing of more than 20 prominent farmer activists in 1975.<ref name=\"Handley-2006\" />{{RP|226}} The murders were an attempt to negate the farmers' new-found political agency and, by so doing, return them to their pre-October 1973 state of relative repression.<ref>Haberkorn, Tyrell (2009). \"An Unfinished Past: Assassination and the 1974 Land Rent Control Act in Northern Thailand\". ''Critical Asian Studies'', Vol. 41, No. 1, p. 28.</ref> The assassinations of farmer activists were part of the state campaign to suppress any potential threat to the king's rule, sanctioned and encouraged by the king as an integral part of his anti-communist purge.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}\u201d\n\n=== Red Gaurs ===\n\u201cThe [[Red Gaurs]] were ex-mercenaries and men discharged from the military for disciplinary infractions mixed with unemployed vocational school graduates, high-school dropouts, idle street corner boys, and slum toughs.<ref name=\"Anderson\" /> In the early-1970s, potential recruits were in dire economic straits, unable to obtain employment, and thus were easy targets of anti-student and anti-worker propaganda.<ref name=\"Anderson\" /> Their grievances were exploited by the state, notably the king's network, and their anger directed towards student protesters. They were recruited not on the basis of ideological commitment, but rather by promises of high pay, abundant liquor, brothel privileges, and the lure of public notoriety.<ref name=\"Anderson\" /> Unlike the Village Scouts and the Nawaphon, the motivation of the Red Gaurs was more sociological than ideological.\u201d\n\n=== Royal family involvement ===\n\u201cKing Bhumibol and the royal family took part frequently in Village Scout activities and attended ceremonies at Kittivudho's college and Red Gaur training camps, thus illustrating their close ties with these three paramilitary forces.<ref name=\"Handley-2006\" />{{RP|227}} While all three forces differed in their nature, they were united by their allegiance to the king and, concomitantly, their hatred of communists. These paramilitary forces would subsequently be mobilized to attack the student protesters at Thammasat University to end their weeks-long protests.\u201d\n\n== Remembrance ==\nAccording to Ron Corben, the Thammasat University massacre continues to be a \"...scar on the Thai collective psyche...\"<ref>{{cite news|last1=Corben|first1=Ron|title=Thailand to Mark 40th Anniversary of Bloody 1976 Massacre|url=http://www.voanews.com/a/thailand-to-mark-40th-anniversary-of-1976-massacre/3537620.html|accessdate=6 October 2016|work=VOA News|date=5 October 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161005162257/http://www.voanews.com/a/thailand-to-mark-40th-anniversary-of-1976-massacre/3537620.html|archive-date=5 October 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The government has remained silent over its role, and that of the king, in the killing of student protesters.

''Critical Asian Studies'', Vol. 47, No. 1.</ref>{{RP|47}} The first amnesty law, passed on 24 December 1976, legalized the coup and prevented those who seized power on the evening of 6 October from being held accountable.<ref name=\"Haberkorn-2015\" />{{RP|44}} The second amnesty law, passed on 16 September 1978, freed eighteen student activists still undergoing criminal prosecution and dismissed the charges against them.<ref name=\"Haberkorn-2015\" />{{RP|44}} The \"hidden transcripts\" of the two amnesties for massacre and coup that followed reveal the careful, calculated legal moves taken to protect those who were behind them.<ref name=\"Haberkorn-2015\" />{{RP|64}} Despite the rhetoric in the streets and on the radio about the need to protect the nation, the coup and the massacre that preceded it unsettled some inside the state, perhaps because they were aware of the extra-legal status of the massacre, perhaps because they worried about their own culpability, and perhaps because they were aware that the violations in need of amnesty were not only those of the criminal code but of the more basic code of being human.<ref name=\"Haberkorn-2015\" />{{RP|64\u201365}} Thus, both amnesty laws sought to produce impunity for state violence, particularly the king's involvement. There has been no state investigation into the violence and this impunity is both cause and effect of the silence, ambivalence, and ambiguity surrounding the event for both those who survived it and Thai society.<ref name=\"Haberkorn-2015\" />{{RP|46}}\n\nThai scholar [[Thongchai Winichakul]], one of the student protesters who was jailed for his participation in the protests at Thammasat University, argues that the clearest evidence of the evasive public memories of the uprisings and massacre are the names the events have come to be known by, and the most conspicuous site of contested memories is the controversy over the memorial for the events.<ref name=Thongchai-2002>Thongchai Winichakul (2002). \"Remembering/ Silencing the Traumatic Past\". In Shigeharu Tanabe and Charles F. Keyes eds., ''Cultural Crisis and Social Memory: Modernity and Identity in Thailand and Laos''. Honolulu: University of Hawaii Press.</ref>{{RP|265}} The massacre continues to be known in Thailand by the deliberately ambiguous term \"6 October event\". Thongchai argues that this non-committal name is loaded with many unsettled meanings, which imply the absence of any commitment and obscures the past because it is too heavily loaded with contesting voices, placing the massacre on the edge between recognizability and anonymity, between history and the silenced past, and between memory and forgetfulness.<ref name=\"Thongchai-2002\" />{{RP|266}} Thus, in \"remembering\" it, its nomenclature carries overt political significance that continues to reverberate in present-day Thai politics, particularly in relation to the role played by the state and King Bhumibol in the attack on student protesters.\n\nThe commemoration in 1996 represented a significant break in the silence. Yet, during the commemoration, what happened twenty years earlier was retold innumerable times, though without any reference to the undiscussable parts of that history.<ref name=\"Thongchai-2002\" />{{RP|274}} There was also no reaction, not even any comment, from the military or any conservative organization.<ref name=\"Thongchai-2002\" />{{RP|274}} More importantly, the denunciation of state crime avoided imputing blame to any specific individual and the victims' self-sacrifice for society's sake was honored.<ref name=\"Thongchai-2002\" />{{RP|274\u2013275}} The role played by King Bhumibol in inciting the military and police and paramilitary forces to attack the student protesters was not mentioned so as not to target the king as an \"individual\". Yet, this could also be interpreted as an attempt by the state to whitewash history by wishing away parts that it did not want the public to know or remember.

Prior to the massacre, four to five thousand students from various universities had demonstrated for more than a week against the return of former military dictator [[Thanom Kittikachorn]] to Thailand from [[Singapore]].\n\nA day before the massacre, the Thai press reported on a play staged by student protesters the previous day, which allegedly featured the mock hanging of then [[Vajiralongkorn|Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn]]. In response to this rumored outrage, military and police, as well as paramilitary forces surrounded the university. Just before dawn on 6 October with the protesters trapped within the campus, the government forces opened fire on them. The brutal attack lasted until noon, eventually devolving into chaos with mob beatings, rapes and lynchings. To this day, the number of casualties remains in dispute between the Thai government and survivors of the massacre.

Thanin and his cabinet restored the repressive climate which had existed before 1973.<ref name=\"Mallet\" />{{RP|91}}\n\n== Significance ==\n\n=== Return of bureaucratic polity ===\nFor forty years from 1932 when the absolute monarchy was abolished, until 1973 when military rule was overthrown in favor of democracy, military officers and civil servants held sway in Thai politics and dominated the government, with King Bhumibol serving as the ceremonial head of state in accordance with his role as a [[Constitutional monarchy|constitutional monarch]] established by the 1932 constitution. The Thai political system was known as a \"bureaucratic [[polity]]\" which was dominated by the military and civilian bureaucrats.<ref>Riggs, Fred (1976). \"The Bureaucratic Polity as a Working System\". In Clark Neher, ed., ''Thailand: From Village to Nation''. Cambridge: Schenkman Books, pp. 406-424.</ref> The massacre disproved the argument that the bureaucratic polity was on the retreat as the military came to play a central role once more in Thai politics, a situation that would continue throughout the 1970s and 1980s until the [[1988 Thai general election|1988 general election]] when all seats were democratically elected, including that of the prime minister, who from 1976 to 1988 was appointed by the king.\n\n=== Withdrawal symptoms ===\nFollowing in the footsteps of previous military strongmen like [[Plaek Phibunsongkhram]] and [[Sarit Thanarat]], Thanom became prime minister in 1963 following Sarit's death. He oversaw a massive influx of financial aid from the United States and Japan, fuelling the Thai economy, as well as increasing American cultural influence. But by the early-1970s, the US was withdrawing its troops from Indochina. In such a context, the Thai middle class and lower-middle class who had supported student efforts in 1973 to topple the Thanom regime were more a product of their immediate history than devotees of democracy.<ref name=\"Anderson\">{{cite journal|last1=Anderson|first1=Ben|title=Withdrawal Symptoms: Social and Cultural Aspects of the October 6 Coup|journal=Bulletin of Concerned Asian Scholars|date=Jul\u2013Sep 1977|volume=9|issue=3|pages=13\u201318|url=http://criticalasianstudies.org/assets/files/bcas/v09n03.pdf|accessdate=5 October 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170106234159/http://criticalasianstudies.org/assets/files/bcas/v09n03.pdf|archive-date=6 January 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>{{RP|18}} They lacked political experience and so had no real idea of the consequences of ending the dictatorship. The regime was simultaneously blamed both for failing to exact fuller commitments from its allies and for excessive subservience to Washington.<ref name=\"Anderson\" />{{RP|18}} The support given by the Thai middle class and lower-middle class to the 1973 student protests was not an unconditional stamp of approval for democratic processes and the chaos that followed. The \"chaotic democracy\" from 1973 to 1976 was seen as having threatened the economic interests of the middle class and lower-middle class who favored stability and peace above democracy. In light of this, while they supported the mass demonstrations against the Thanom regime leading up to the uprising on 14 October 1973, they turned their backs on democracy, hence Anderson's use of the phrase \"withdrawal symptoms\", and welcomed the return to dictatorship on 6 October 1976, heralding the end of the period of chaotic democracy.\n\n== Left-wing Conspiracy Theory ==\n\n=== Overview ===\n{{more citations needed|section|date=October 2017|reason=first paragraph has no citations}}\nDespite being the most popular assumption among left-wing scholars, there are not empirical evidences which concluded that King Bhumibol had supported student protesters in their demonstrations in 1973 that led to the downfall of the Thanom regime and resulted in the period of \"chaotic democracy\" from 1973 to 1976, but had turned against the students and played a crucial, if not the most important, role in bringing about the massacre and a return to military rule after a three-year flirtation with democracy.\n\nAccording to the conspiracy theory, \u201cthere were two reasons for this about-face.\u201d \u201cFirst, Thailand's neighbors either were facing communist insurgencies or had fallen to communist rule and become communist countries.\u201d \u201cThe US was withdrawing its military presence from the region. The pivotal year in the trajectory of the king's involvement in politics was 1975. [[South Vietnam]] fell to the communists and the [[Communist Party of Vietnam]] was able to unify the country under its rule and drive out the US. In Cambodia, the communist [[Khmer Rouge]] [[Fall of Phnom Penh|captured Phnom Penh]] and began a reign of terror that would only end in 1979. The 1975 incident that arguably shook the Thai monarchy to the core was the overthrow by the [[Lao People's Revolutionary Party]] of the [[Lao Royal Family]], to which the Thai monarchy traditionally had cultural and historical ties. Second, the period of chaotic democracy brought instability and chaos as demonstrations, strikes, and protests took place much more frequently. They threatened the economic interests of the monarchy managed by the [[Crown Property Bureau]], which favored a stable and peaceful economic environment that would allow its businesses to thrive.\u201d\n\n\u201cKing Bhumibol wielded his influence through a \"[[network monarchy]]\" that was centered on [[Privy Council of Thailand|Privy Council]] President [[Prem Tinsulanonda]]. One of the main features of the network monarchy was that the monarch intervened actively in political developments, largely by working through proxies such as privy councillors and trusted military figures.<ref>McCargo, Duncan (2005). \"Network Monarchy and Legitimacy Crises\". ''The Pacific Review'', Vol. 18, No. 4, p. 501.</ref> This network monarchy suggests that, contrary to the popular belief that the king was a constitutional monarch and above politics, rather he had been intimately involved in Thai politics and had often intervened in order to secure his political and economic interests. The instability brought about by the student protesters until 1976 as well as the growing specter of communist threat in the region, especially after the \"domino effect\" where Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos fell in succession to the communists, convinced King Bhumibol to see the protesters as a threat to his rule. The Thai state and its politicians subsequently branded these students, as well as workers and farmers, as \"communists\" and a \"fifth column for the [[Communist Party of Thailand]] (CPT) and [[North Vietnam]].\"<ref name=\"Handley-2006\" />{{RP|220}} In reality, there was little evidence for the claim that protesters, including students protesting at Thammasat University, were communists. While the CPT had grown in strength, they were far from a unified force and they appealed to peasants by focusing on social injustices while avoiding attacking the monarchy and Buddhism. Their gains were fuelled more by the government's alienation of the peasantry.<ref name=\"Handley-2006\" />{{RP|220}} This suggests that the term \"communists\" was applied very liberally and indiscriminately and more often than not, deliberately, to those who were deemed to be the sources of instability that threatened the monarchy and the king. In the Thai state's view, communism was simply the enemy of the nation, religion (Buddhism), and monarchy, and a sworn enemy of \"Thainess\".<ref name=Thongchai-1994>Winichakul, Thongchai (1994). ''Siam Mapped: A History of the Geo-Body of Siam''.

This culminated in the Thammasat massacre.\u201d\n\n=== Village Scouts ===\n\u201cThe Village Scouts organization was a national [[paramilitary]] group sponsored by the King and Queen of Thailand since 1972 in order to promote national unity against threats to Thai independence and freedom, particularly against \"communism\".<ref name=Muecke>Muecke, Marjorie (1980). \"The Village Scouts of Thailand\". ''Asian Survey'', Vol. 20, No. 4.</ref>{{RP|407}} The movement was set up explicitly to protect the monarchy from communism. It focused on the central features of Thai identity: love of play, deep respect for the king and religion (Buddhism), and for ethnic Thai \"specialness\".<ref name=\"Muecke\" />{{RP|413}} The king was held to be central to the Thai nation, to be protected at all costs, alongside the nation and religion, forming the Thai nationalist [[shibboleth]], \"nation, religion, king\". The Village Scouts presence provided continuous proof of militant political support for nation-religion-king beyond the Bangkok upper classes, among the \"establishments\" of provincial capitals, small towns, and villages. It helped to legitimize private, localized repression of protesting peasants and student activists as essential for the preservation the status quo.<ref name=\"Anderson\" /> During the period 1973\u20131976, Village Scout membership rose to tens of thousands, almost all in rural, CPT-influenced Thailand. After an [[Internal Security Operations Command]] (ISOC) takeover, the Village Scouts metamorphosed into a [[fascist]]-style mass political movement that would play a major role in the ensuing massacre.<ref name=\"Handley-2006\" />{{RP|224}}\u201d\n\n=== Nawaphon ===\n\u201c[[Nawaphon]] was an ISOC operation organized in 1974. It was composed of mainly low-level government functionaries and clerks, rural village and communal headmen, as well as a number of monks.<ref name=Keyes>Keyes, Charles (1978). \"Political Crisis and Militant Buddhism in Contemporary Thailand\". In Bardwell L. Smith, ed., ''Religion and Legitimation of Power in Thailand, Laos, and Burma''. Chambersburg: Anima Books.</ref>{{RP|151}} The name \"Nawaphon\" means \"nine strengths\", a reference to either the [[Chakri dynasty|Chakri Ninth Reign (King Bhumibol)]]<ref name=\"Handley-2006\" />{{RP|225}} or the nine points of Nawaphon's program to preserve Thai nationalism.<ref name=\"Keyes\" />{{RP|151}} The aim of Nawaphon was to protect the king from threats like communism. A key figure of the movement was the monk, Kittivudho Bhikkhu, who became its leader in 1975. In a June 1976 interview he was asked if killing leftists or communists would produce demerits or negative [[karma]], he said that such killing would not be demeriting because, \"...whoever destroys the nation, the religion or the monarchy, such bestial types are not complete persons. Thus, we must intend not to kill people but to kill the Devil; this is the duty of all Thai\".<ref name=\"Keyes\" />{{RP|153}} In 1967, he established Jittiphawan College. It was inaugurated by King Bhumibol and Queen Sirikit who returned regularly even after Kittivudho began to make incendiary speeches about the need to deal with student protesters and communists.<ref name=\"Handley-2006\" />{{RP|225}} This suggests a close relationship between the Nawaphon movement and the royal family. Employing the slogan that \"killing communists is not demeritorious\", Kittivudho encouraged the killings of alleged communists from 1973 to 1976 and injected militant Buddhism into the Thai [[body politic]], eventually inciting his followers to commit violence at Thammasat University on 6 October. Earlier, Nawaphon was responsible for the killing of more than 20 prominent farmer activists in 1975.<ref name=\"Handley-2006\" />{{RP|226}} The murders were an attempt to negate the farmers' new-found political agency and, by so doing, return them to their pre-October 1973 state of relative repression.<ref>Haberkorn, Tyrell (2009). \"An Unfinished Past: Assassination and the 1974 Land Rent Control Act in Northern Thailand\". ''Critical Asian Studies'', Vol. 41, No. 1, p. 28.</ref> The assassinations of farmer activists were part of the state campaign to suppress any potential threat to the king's rule, sanctioned and encouraged by the king as an integral part of his anti-communist purge.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}\u201d\n\n=== Red Gaurs ===\n\u201cThe [[Red Gaurs]] were ex-mercenaries and men discharged from the military for disciplinary infractions mixed with unemployed vocational school graduates, high-school dropouts, idle street corner boys, and slum toughs.<ref name=\"Anderson\" /> In the early-1970s, potential recruits were in dire economic straits, unable to obtain employment, and thus were easy targets of anti-student and anti-worker propaganda.<ref name=\"Anderson\" /> Their grievances were exploited by the state, notably the king's network, and their anger directed towards student protesters. They were recruited not on the basis of ideological commitment, but rather by promises of high pay, abundant liquor, brothel privileges, and the lure of public notoriety.<ref name=\"Anderson\" /> Unlike the Village Scouts and the Nawaphon, the motivation of the Red Gaurs was more sociological than ideological.\u201d\n\n=== Royal family involvement ===\n\u201cKing Bhumibol and the royal family took part frequently in Village Scout activities and attended ceremonies at Kittivudho's college and Red Gaur training camps, thus illustrating their close ties with these three paramilitary forces.<ref name=\"Handley-2006\" />{{RP|227}} While all three forces differed in their nature, they were united by their allegiance to the king and, concomitantly, their hatred of communists. These paramilitary forces would subsequently be mobilized to attack the student protesters at Thammasat University to end their weeks-long protests.\u201d\n\n== Remembrance ==\nAccording to Ron Corben, the Thammasat University massacre continues to be a \"...scar on the Thai collective psyche...\"<ref>{{cite news|last1=Corben|first1=Ron|title=Thailand to Mark 40th Anniversary of Bloody 1976 Massacre|url=http://www.voanews.com/a/thailand-to-mark-40th-anniversary-of-1976-massacre/3537620.html|accessdate=6 October 2016|work=VOA News|date=5 October 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161005162257/http://www.voanews.com/a/thailand-to-mark-40th-anniversary-of-1976-massacre/3537620.html|archive-date=5 October 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The government has remained silent over its role, and that of the king, in the killing of student protesters.

''Critical Asian Studies'', Vol. 47, No. 1.</ref>{{RP|47}} The first amnesty law, passed on 24 December 1976, legalized the coup and prevented those who seized power on the evening of 6 October from being held accountable.<ref name=\"Haberkorn-2015\" />{{RP|44}} The second amnesty law, passed on 16 September 1978, freed eighteen student activists still undergoing criminal prosecution and dismissed the charges against them.<ref name=\"Haberkorn-2015\" />{{RP|44}} The \"hidden transcripts\" of the two amnesties for massacre and coup that followed reveal the careful, calculated legal moves taken to protect those who were behind them.<ref name=\"Haberkorn-2015\" />{{RP|64}} Despite the rhetoric in the streets and on the radio about the need to protect the nation, the coup and the massacre that preceded it unsettled some inside the state, perhaps because they were aware of the extra-legal status of the massacre, perhaps because they worried about their own culpability, and perhaps because they were aware that the violations in need of amnesty were not only those of the criminal code but of the more basic code of being human.<ref name=\"Haberkorn-2015\" />{{RP|64-65}} Thus, both amnesty laws sought to produce impunity for state violence, particularly the king's involvement. There has been no state investigation into the violence and this impunity is both cause and effect of the silence, ambivalence, and ambiguity surrounding the event for both those who survived it and Thai society.<ref name=\"Haberkorn-2015\" />{{RP|46}}\n\nThai scholar [[Thongchai Winichakul]], one of the student protesters who was jailed for his participation in the protests at Thammasat University, argues that the clearest evidence of the evasive public memories of the uprisings and massacre are the names the events have come to be known by, and the most conspicuous site of contested memories is the controversy over the memorial for the events.<ref name=Thongchai-2002>Thongchai Winichakul (2002). \"Remembering/ Silencing the Traumatic Past\". In Shigeharu Tanabe and Charles F. Keyes eds., ''Cultural Crisis and Social Memory: Modernity and Identity in Thailand and Laos''. Honolulu: University of Hawaii Press.</ref>{{RP|265}} The massacre continues to be known in Thailand by the deliberately ambiguous term \"6 October event\". Thongchai argues that this non-committal name is loaded with many unsettled meanings, which imply the absence of any commitment and obscures the past because it is too heavily loaded with contesting voices, placing the massacre on the edge between recognizability and anonymity, between history and the silenced past, and between memory and forgetfulness.<ref name=\"Thongchai-2002\" />{{RP|266}} Thus, in \"remembering\" it, its nomenclature carries overt political significance that continues to reverberate in present-day Thai politics, particularly in relation to the role played by the state and King Bhumibol in the attack on student protesters.\n\nThe commemoration in 1996 represented a significant break in the silence. Yet, during the commemoration, what happened twenty years earlier was retold innumerable times, though without any reference to the undiscussable parts of that history.<ref name=\"Thongchai-2002\" />{{RP|274}} There was also no reaction, not even any comment, from the military or any conservative organization.<ref name=\"Thongchai-2002\" />{{RP|274}} More importantly, the denunciation of state crime avoided imputing blame to any specific individual and the victims' self-sacrifice for society's sake was honored.<ref name=\"Thongchai-2002\" />{{RP|274-275}} The role played by King Bhumibol in inciting the military and police and paramilitary forces to attack the student protesters was not mentioned so as not to target the king as an \"individual\". Yet, this could also be interpreted as an attempt by the state to whitewash history by wishing away parts that it did not want the public to know or remember. In addition, by emphasizing the theme of healing and reconciliation in the remembrance, the Thai state, and by implication the king, have sought to make clear that the commemoration had no interest in and would not be involved in any talk of [[wikt:retribution|retribution]].<ref name=\"Thongchai-2002\" />{{RP|274}} Forty years later, the perpetrators remain unnamed and unpunished. Tyrell Haberkorn, the Thailand scholar, speculates that the death of Rama IX, King Bhumipol Adulyadej, may make it even more difficult to name the perpetrators as Rama IX's reign becomes more idealized.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Haberkorn |first1=Tyrell |title=The Anniversary of a Massacre and the Death of a Monarch |journal=The Journal of Asian Studies |date=2017 |volume=76 |issue=2 |page=269 |pages=281 |doi=10.1017/S0021911817000018 |url=https://www-cambridge-org.ccl.idm.oclc.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/4FD9FA295086CE51B654BCAD342D1F88/S0021911817000018a.pdf/anniversary_of_a_massacre_and_the_death_of_a_monarch.pdf |accessdate=3 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-37520961 BBC News interview with Thongchai Winichakul]\n\n{{Thammasat University}}\n{{Thai coups}}\n{{History of Thailand since 1973}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Thammasat University Massacre}}\n[[Category:1976 in Thailand]]\n[[Category:Mass murder in 1976]]\n[[Category:Massacres in Thailand]]\n[[Category:Political repression in Thailand]]\n[[Category:Protests in Thailand]]\n[[Category:School massacres]]\n[[Category:Thammasat University]]\n[[Category:History of Bangkok]]\n[[Category:Rebellions in Thailand]]\n[[Category:October 1976 events in Asia]]\n", "name_user": "Dawnseeker2000", "label": "safe", "comment": "refine ref details", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thammasat_University_massacre"}

He played fourteen years for five [[National League]] teams from 1946 through 1960. Dark was named the major leagues' {{baseball year|1948}} [[MLB Rookie of the Year Award|Rookie of the Year]] after [[Batting average (baseball)|batting]] .322 for the [[Boston Braves (baseball)|Boston Braves]].\n\nDark was an [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]] for three seasons. He hit .300 or more three times while playing for the [[New York Giants (NL)|New York Giants]], and became the first NL shortstop to hit 20 [[home run]]s more than once. His .411 career [[slugging average]] was the seventh highest by an NL shortstop at his retirement, and his 126 home runs placed him behind only [[Ernie Banks]] and [[Travis Jackson]]. After leading the NL in [[putout]]s and [[double play]]s three times each, he ended his career with the seventh most double plays (933) and tenth highest [[fielding percentage]] (.960) at shortstop in league history. He went on to become the third manager to win pennants in both the National and [[American League]] (since then five other managers have achieved the feat as well).\n\n==Early life==\nDark was born in [[Comanche, Oklahoma]]. He was raised in [[Louisiana]].<ref name=\"Dark\">Schudel, Matt (November 14, 2014) \"Shortstop later headed 2 World Series Teams\" ''The Washington Post'', page B6 [https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/alvin-dark-baseball-player-and-manager-who-led-oakland-as-to-1974-title-dies-at-92/2014/11/13/76008438-6b62-11e4-a31c-77759fc1eacc_story.html]</ref> Dark studied at [[Louisiana State University]] where he was a brother of [[Phi Delta Theta]] and at the Southwestern Louisiana Institute, now named the [[University of Louisiana at Lafayette]], where he completed his bachelor's degree in 1947.<ref name=\"Dark\"/>\n\n==Baseball career==\n===College career===\nDark attended [[Louisiana State University|LSU]] in 1942 and was a [[American football|football]] standout there as well as a baseball player. During World War II, he transferred through the [[V-12 Navy College Training Program|V-12 program]] to the [[University of Louisiana at Lafayette]] (then Southwestern Louisiana Institute) in [[Lafayette, Louisiana]], where he again showed his baseball skills, batting .461 in 1944. His football skills were evident there as well as he [[quarterback]]ed SLI to an undefeated season in 1943 and a New Year's Day victory in the [[Oil Bowl]]. This led to his getting [[NFL Draft|drafted]] by the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] in the [[1945 NFL Draft]]. After serving in Asia during the war, however, he came home and chose baseball.\n\n===Major leagues===\n====Player====\nHe was named the MLB Rookie of the Year and finished third in the [[MLB Most Valuable Player Award|MVP]] voting in 1948 after playing a vital part of the Boston Braves' unlikely run to the pennant, their first since 1914, though he hit only .167 in the [[1948 World Series|World Series]] loss to the [[Cleveland Indians]]. He was traded after the {{baseball year|1949}} season, which turned out to be a boon for the Giants. Dark was immediately named team [[captain (sports)|captain]] by manager [[Leo Durocher]], and had several great seasons in New York. In {{baseball year|1951}} he batted .303 with 114 [[run (baseball)|runs]] and a league-leading 41 [[double (baseball)|doubles]] as the Giants won their first pennant since 1937; he hit .417 in the [[1951 World Series|World Series]] against the [[New York Yankees]], including a three-run home run in Game 1, though the Giants lost in six games. He followed up with seasons hitting .301 and .300 in 1952-53, scoring 126 runs with 23 home runs and 41 doubles in the latter season. In {{baseball year|1954}} he batted .293 with 20 home runs and was fifth in the MVP voting as the Giants won another pennant; in the [[1954 World Series|World Series]] against the heavily favored Indians, he batted .412 with a [[hit (baseball)|hit]] in every game, and the Giants pulled off an astonishing sweep to win their first championship since 1933. He was the NL's starting shortstop for the [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]] game in 1951, {{baseball year|1952}} and 1954. In {{baseball year|1955}} he was awarded the first [[Lou Gehrig Memorial Award]], given to the player who best exemplified Gehrig's character and integrity both on and off the field.\n\n[[File:Al Dark - St. Louis Cardinals - 1957.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Dark in 1957]]\nIn June 1956 he was traded to the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] in a nine-player deal; he continued to hit well, and led the NL in putouts and double plays for the third time in 1957. He was traded to the [[Chicago Cubs]] in May 1958, batting .295 over the remainder of the season and .264 in 1959; with [[Ernie Banks]] at shortstop, the Cubs shifted Dark to [[third baseman|third base]], where he remained in his last seasons.\n\nDark had a role in one of baseball history's weirdest plays. It took place during a game played on June 30, 1959, between the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] and [[Chicago Cubs]]. [[Stan Musial]] was at the plate, with a count of 3-1. [[Bob Anderson (baseball)|Bob Anderson's]] next pitch was errant, evading catcher [[Sammy Taylor (baseball)|Sammy Taylor]] and rolling all the way to the backstop. Umpire [[Vic Delmore]] called ball four, but Anderson and Taylor contended that Musial [[foul tip]]ped the ball. Because the ball was still in play, and because Delmore was embroiled in an argument with the catcher and pitcher, Musial took it upon himself to try for second base. Seeing that Musial was trying for second, Dark ran to the backstop to retrieve the ball. The ball wound up in the hands of field announcer [[Pat Pieper]], but Dark ended up getting it back anyway. Absentmindedly, however, Delmore pulled out a new ball and gave it to Taylor. Anderson finally noticed that Musial was trying for second, took the new ball, and threw it to second baseman [[Tony Taylor (baseball)|Tony Taylor]]. Anderson's throw flew over Tony Taylor's head into the outfield. Dark, at the same time that Anderson threw the new ball, threw the original ball to shortstop [[Ernie Banks]]. Musial, though, did not see Dark's throw and only noticed Anderson's ball fly over the second baseman's head, so he tried to go to third base. On his way there, he was tagged by Banks, and after a delay he was ruled out.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=tTtSAAAAIBAJ&sjid=_3YDAAAAIBAJ&pg=4767,261477&dq=bob+anderson+stan+musial&hl=en|title=St. Petersburg Times - Google News Archive Search|website=news.google.com}}</ref>\n\nIn January {{baseball year|1960}} he was traded with two other players to the [[Philadelphia Phillies]] in exchange for [[Richie Ashburn]]; after hitting .242 in 55 games, he was traded back to the Braves (now in Milwaukee) in June, and hit .298 in his final 50 games. On October 31 of that year, he was traded back to the Giants (who had moved to San Francisco two years earlier), who wanted him as their new manager rather than as a player. Dark retired with a .289 career batting average, 2089 hits, 1064 runs and 757 [[run batted in|runs batted in]] over 1,828 [[games played]]. Defensively, he recorded a .959 [[fielding percentage]]. According to baseball writer [[Bill James]], he may have lost a [[Baseball Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] career due to his debut being delayed by his military service during World War II.\n\nIn a 1969 poll, Giants fans selected Dark as the greatest shortstop in team history.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YoDBAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA168&lpg=PA168&dq=%22alvin+dark%22+greatest+shortstop+in+giants+history+1969&source=bl&ots=W4mNAIkDct&sig=6IvbLNtiOF5RUpwZGSjt20CqwDI&hl=en&sa=X&ei=IX1mVIyTBcepogTz-YKIDg&ved=0CDoQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=%22alvin%20dark%22%20greatest%20shortstop%20in%20giants%20history%201969&f=false | title=100 Things Giants Fans Should Know & Do Before They Die | publisher=Triumph Books | author=Chastain, Bill | year=2011 | pages=168 | isbn=9781617495106}}</ref>\n\n====Manager====\n=====Managerial career=====\nDark quickly became a successful manager, winning a pennant with the Giants in {{baseball year|1962}}, but losing the [[1962 World Series]] in seven games to the Yankees. In 1964, he became embroiled in controversy when he was quoted in ''[[Newsday]]'' as complaining about the number of black and Hispanic players on the team and saying, \"They are just not able to perform up to the white player when it comes to mental alertness.\" He responded that he had been severely misquoted; [[Willie Mays]], whom he had named as team captain, came to his defense and calmed the team, and [[Jackie Robinson]] further noted, \"I have found Dark to be a gentleman and, above all, unbiased. Our relationship has not only been on the ballfield but off it.\" Dark weathered the imbroglio, but Giants owner [[Horace Stoneham]] fired him during the sixth inning of the last game of the season, with the team about to finish in fourth place.<ref>James S. Hirsch, Willie Mays: The Life, The Legend, at 420 (Scribner 2010).</ref>\n\nDark's [[Topps]] 1961 manager baseball card was featured in the 2001 film ''[[Skipped Parts]]'' being thrown into a fire as part of a rite of passage/growing up event between a stern grandfather ([[R. Lee Ermey]]) and his grandson ([[Bug Hall]]).<ref name=\"Mark Armour\">{{cite web|url=https://sabrbaseballcards.blog/2017/04/19/skipped-parts/|author=Mark Armour|title=Skipped Parts|publisher=Society of American Baseball Research |date=April 19, 2017|accessdate=April 19, 2017}}</ref>\n\nAfter serving one year ({{baseball year|1965}}) as a coach for the Cubs, Dark was hired as an assistant to [[Kansas City Athletics]] owner [[Charles O. Finley|Charlie Finley]] at season's end. During the winter, Dark moved up to manager of the last-place Athletics, and he led a youthful [[1966 Kansas City Athletics season|1966 team]] to a 15-game improvement and a sixth-place finish in the ten-team [[American League]]. But he was dismissed in August 1967 in a disagreement over player discipline after Finley fined and suspended pitcher [[Lew Krausse, Jr.]] for his behavior on a team flight. (Finley also released first baseman [[Ken Harrelson]], who had been quoted as saying that Finley was a menace to the sport.)\n\nDark was hired to manage the [[Cleveland Indians]] in 1968 by [[Vernon Stouffer]]; after an initial third-place season, he was given the additional duties of [[general manager]], but having the field manager negotiate the players' contracts proved an untenable situation. The Indians returned to their losing ways and Dark was fired in mid-1971 with the team in last place.<ref>\n{{cite book\n| author=Torry, Jack\n| chapter=Chapter 6, You're Committing Suicide\n| title=Endless Summers: The Fall and Rise of the Cleveland Indians\n| editor=\n| publisher=Diamond Communications, Inc.\n| isbn= 0-912083-98-0\n| year=1996| pages=104\u2013125}}</ref>   In the meantime, the Athletics had moved to Oakland, and after manager [[Dick Williams]] resigned following consecutive [[World Series]] triumphs in 1972-73, Finley rehired Dark. He guided the A's to a third straight championship in [[1974 World Series|1974]], joining managers [[Joe McCarthy (manager)|Joe McCarthy]] and [[Yogi Berra]] by winning pennants in both leagues.  ([[Sparky Anderson]], [[Dick Williams]], [[Tony La Russa]], [[Jim Leyland]] and [[Joe Maddon]] have since accomplished that feat.)  He also joined a long list of baseball men to win a World Series as both a player and manager.  However, Dark was again fired after losing the [[1975 American League Championship Series]]. He was hired by the [[San Diego Padres]] in mid-1977, after another brief term as a Cubs' coach, but left the team after that season following a fifth-place finish.

A's owner [[Charlie O.

He played fourteen years for five [[National League]] teams from 1946 through 1960. Dark was named the major leagues' {{baseball year|1948}} [[MLB Rookie of the Year Award|Rookie of the Year]] after [[Batting average (baseball)|batting]] .322 for the [[Boston Braves (baseball)|Boston Braves]].\n\nDark was an [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]] for three seasons. He hit .300 or more three times while playing for the [[New York Giants (NL)|New York Giants]], and became the first NL shortstop to hit 20 [[home run]]s more than once. His .411 career [[slugging average]] was the seventh highest by an NL shortstop at his retirement, and his 126 home runs placed him behind only [[Ernie Banks]] and [[Travis Jackson]]. After leading the NL in [[putout]]s and [[double play]]s three times each, he ended his career with the seventh most double plays (933) and tenth highest [[fielding percentage]] (.960) at shortstop in league history. He went on to become the third manager to win pennants in both the National and [[American League]] (since then five other managers have achieved the feat as well).\n\n==Early life==\nDark was born in [[Comanche, Oklahoma]]. He was raised in [[Louisiana]].<ref name=\"Dark\">Schudel, Matt (November 14, 2014) \"Shortstop later headed 2 World Series Teams\" ''The Washington Post'', page B6 [https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/alvin-dark-baseball-player-and-manager-who-led-oakland-as-to-1974-title-dies-at-92/2014/11/13/76008438-6b62-11e4-a31c-77759fc1eacc_story.html]</ref> Dark studied at [[Louisiana State University]] where he was a brother of [[Phi Delta Theta]] and at the Southwestern Louisiana Institute, now named the [[University of Louisiana at Lafayette]], where he completed his bachelor's degree in 1947.<ref name=\"Dark\"/>\n\n==Baseball career==\n===College career===\nDark attended [[Louisiana State University|LSU]] in 1942 and was a [[American football|football]] standout there as well as a baseball player. During World War II, he transferred through the [[V-12 Navy College Training Program|V-12 program]] to the [[University of Louisiana at Lafayette]] (then Southwestern Louisiana Institute) in [[Lafayette, Louisiana]], where he again showed his baseball skills, batting .461 in 1944. His football skills were evident there as well as he [[quarterback]]ed SLI to an undefeated season in 1943 and a New Year's Day victory in the [[Oil Bowl]]. This led to his getting [[NFL Draft|drafted]] by the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] in the [[1945 NFL Draft]]. After serving in Asia during the war, however, he came home and chose baseball.\n\n===Major leagues===\n====Player====\nHe was named the MLB Rookie of the Year and finished third in the [[MLB Most Valuable Player Award|MVP]] voting in 1948 after playing a vital part of the Boston Braves' unlikely run to the pennant, their first since 1914, though he hit only .167 in the [[1948 World Series|World Series]] loss to the [[Cleveland Indians]]. He was traded after the {{baseball year|1949}} season, which turned out to be a boon for the Giants. Dark was immediately named team [[captain (sports)|captain]] by manager [[Leo Durocher]], and had several great seasons in New York. In {{baseball year|1951}} he batted .303 with 114 [[run (baseball)|runs]] and a league-leading 41 [[double (baseball)|doubles]] as the Giants won their first pennant since 1937; he hit .417 in the [[1951 World Series|World Series]] against the [[New York Yankees]], including a three-run home run in Game 1, though the Giants lost in six games. He followed up with seasons hitting .301 and .300 in 1952-53, scoring 126 runs with 23 home runs and 41 doubles in the latter season. In {{baseball year|1954}} he batted .293 with 20 home runs and was fifth in the MVP voting as the Giants won another pennant; in the [[1954 World Series|World Series]] against the heavily favored Indians, he batted .412 with a [[hit (baseball)|hit]] in every game, and the Giants pulled off an astonishing sweep to win their first championship since 1933. He was the NL's starting shortstop for the [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]] game in 1951, {{baseball year|1952}} and 1954. In {{baseball year|1955}} he was awarded the first [[Lou Gehrig Memorial Award]], given to the player who best exemplified Gehrig's character and integrity both on and off the field.\n\n[[File:Al Dark - St. Louis Cardinals - 1957.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Dark in 1957]]\nIn June 1956 he was traded to the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] in a nine-player deal; he continued to hit well, and led the NL in putouts and double plays for the third time in 1957. He was traded to the [[Chicago Cubs]] in May 1958, batting .295 over the remainder of the season and .264 in 1959; with [[Ernie Banks]] at shortstop, the Cubs shifted Dark to [[third baseman|third base]], where he remained in his last seasons.\n\nDark had a role in one of baseball history's weirdest plays. It took place during a game played on June 30, 1959, between the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] and [[Chicago Cubs]]. [[Stan Musial]] was at the plate, with a count of 3-1. [[Bob Anderson (baseball)|Bob Anderson's]] next pitch was errant, evading catcher [[Sammy Taylor (baseball)|Sammy Taylor]] and rolling all the way to the backstop. Umpire [[Vic Delmore]] called ball four, but Anderson and Taylor contended that Musial [[foul tip]]ped the ball. Because the ball was still in play, and because Delmore was embroiled in an argument with the catcher and pitcher, Musial took it upon himself to try for second base. Seeing that Musial was trying for second, Dark ran to the backstop to retrieve the ball. The ball wound up in the hands of field announcer [[Pat Pieper]], but Dark ended up getting it back anyway. Absentmindedly, however, Delmore pulled out a new ball and gave it to Taylor. Anderson finally noticed that Musial was trying for second, took the new ball, and threw it to second baseman [[Tony Taylor (baseball)|Tony Taylor]]. Anderson's throw flew over Tony Taylor's head into the outfield. Dark, at the same time that Anderson threw the new ball, threw the original ball to shortstop [[Ernie Banks]]. Musial, though, did not see Dark's throw and only noticed Anderson's ball fly over the second baseman's head, so he tried to go to third base. On his way there, he was tagged by Banks, and after a delay he was ruled out.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=tTtSAAAAIBAJ&sjid=_3YDAAAAIBAJ&pg=4767,261477&dq=bob+anderson+stan+musial&hl=en|title=St. Petersburg Times - Google News Archive Search|website=news.google.com}}</ref>\n\nIn January {{baseball year|1960}} he was traded with two other players to the [[Philadelphia Phillies]] in exchange for [[Richie Ashburn]]; after hitting .242 in 55 games, he was traded back to the Braves (now in Milwaukee) in June, and hit .298 in his final 50 games. On October 31 of that year, he was traded back to the Giants (who had moved to San Francisco two years earlier), who wanted him as their new manager rather than as a player. Dark retired with a .289 career batting average, 2089 hits, 1064 runs and 757 [[run batted in|runs batted in]] over 1,828 [[games played]]. Defensively, he recorded a .959 [[fielding percentage]]. According to baseball writer [[Bill James]], he may have lost a [[Baseball Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] career due to his debut being delayed by his military service during World War II.\n\nIn a 1969 poll, Giants fans selected Dark as the greatest shortstop in team history.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YoDBAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA168&lpg=PA168&dq=%22alvin+dark%22+greatest+shortstop+in+giants+history+1969&source=bl&ots=W4mNAIkDct&sig=6IvbLNtiOF5RUpwZGSjt20CqwDI&hl=en&sa=X&ei=IX1mVIyTBcepogTz-YKIDg&ved=0CDoQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=%22alvin%20dark%22%20greatest%20shortstop%20in%20giants%20history%201969&f=false | title=100 Things Giants Fans Should Know & Do Before They Die | publisher=Triumph Books | author=Chastain, Bill | year=2011 | pages=168 | isbn=9781617495106}}</ref>\n\n====Manager====\n=====Managerial career=====\nDark quickly became a successful manager, winning a pennant with the Giants in {{baseball year|1962}}, but losing the [[1962 World Series]] in seven games to the Yankees. In 1964, he became embroiled in controversy when he was quoted in ''[[Newsday]]'' as complaining about the number of black and Hispanic players on the team and saying, \"They are just not able to perform up to the white player when it comes to mental alertness.\" He responded that he had been severely misquoted; [[Willie Mays]], whom he had named as team captain, came to his defense and calmed the team, and [[Jackie Robinson]] further noted, \"I have found Dark to be a gentleman and, above all, unbiased. Our relationship has not only been on the ballfield but off it.\" Dark weathered the imbroglio, but Giants owner [[Horace Stoneham]] fired him during the sixth inning of the last game of the season, with the team about to finish in fourth place.<ref>James S. Hirsch, Willie Mays: The Life, The Legend, at 420 (Scribner 2010).</ref>\n\nDark's [[Topps]] 1961 manager baseball card was featured in the 2001 film ''[[Skipped Parts]]'' being thrown into a fire as part of a rite of passage/growing up event between a stern grandfather ([[R.

Finley|Charlie Finley]] at season's end. During the winter, Dark moved up to manager of the last-place Athletics, and he led a youthful [[1966 Kansas City Athletics season|1966 team]] to a 15-game improvement and a sixth-place finish in the ten-team [[American League]]. But he was dismissed in August 1967 in a disagreement over player discipline after Finley fined and suspended pitcher [[Lew Krausse, Jr.]] for his behavior on a team flight. (Finley also released first baseman [[Ken Harrelson]], who had been quoted as saying that Finley was a menace to the sport.)\n\nDark was hired to manage the [[Cleveland Indians]] in 1968 by [[Vernon Stouffer]]; after an initial third-place season, he was given the additional duties of [[general manager]], but having the field manager negotiate the players' contracts proved an untenable situation. The Indians returned to their losing ways and Dark was fired in mid-1971 with the team in last place.<ref>\n{{cite book\n| author=Torry, Jack\n| chapter=Chapter 6, You're Committing Suicide\n| title=Endless Summers: The Fall and Rise of the Cleveland Indians\n| editor=\n| publisher=Diamond Communications, Inc.\n| isbn= 0-912083-98-0\n| year=1996| pages=104\u2013125}}</ref>   In the meantime, the Athletics had moved to Oakland, and after manager [[Dick Williams]] resigned following consecutive [[World Series]] triumphs in 1972-73, Finley rehired Dark. He guided the A's to a third straight championship in [[1974 World Series|1974]], joining managers [[Joe McCarthy (manager)|Joe McCarthy]] and [[Yogi Berra]] by winning pennants in both leagues.  ([[Sparky Anderson]], [[Dick Williams]], [[Tony La Russa]], [[Jim Leyland]] and [[Joe Maddon]] have since accomplished that feat.)  He also joined a long list of baseball men to win a World Series as both a player and manager.  However, Dark was again fired after losing the [[1975 American League Championship Series]]. He was hired by the [[San Diego Padres]] in mid-1977, after another brief term as a Cubs' coach, but left the team after that season following a fifth-place finish.

Annual rainfall is about {{convert|1000|mm}} and up to {{convert|2000|mm}} on higher ground.<ref name=\"weather\"/>  Summer maxima averages range from {{convert|18|\u00b0C}} to {{convert|22|\u00b0C}} and winter minimum averages range from {{convert|1|\u00b0C}} to {{convert|4|\u00b0C}} across the south-west.<ref name=\"weather\">{{cite web|title=South West England: climate |work=Met Office |url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/sw/ |accessdate=14 March 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605003222/http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/sw/ |archivedate= 5 June 2011 }}</ref> It is the second windiest area of the United Kingdom, the majority of winds coming from the south-west and north-east.<ref name=\"weather\"/> Government organisations predict the region to rise in temperature and become the hottest region in the United Kingdom.<ref name=\"future\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/cornwall/8108383.stm|title=South west faces temperature jump|date=19 June 2009|work=BBC News|accessdate=25 June 2009}}</ref>\n\nInland areas of low altitude experience the least amount of precipitation. They experience the highest summer maxima temperatures, but winter minima are colder than the coast. Snowfalls are more frequent in comparison to the coast, but less so in comparison to higher ground.<ref name=\"weather\"/> It experiences the lowest wind speeds and sunshine total in between that of the coast and the moors. The climate of inland areas is more noticeable the further north-east into the region.\n\nIn comparison to inland areas, the coast experiences high minimum temperatures, especially in winter, and it experiences slightly lower maximum temperatures during the summer. Rainfall is the lowest at the coast and snowfall is rarer than the rest of the region. Coastal areas are the windiest parts of the peninsula and they receive the most sunshine. The general coastal climate is more typical the further south-west into the region.\n\nAreas of [[moorland]] inland such as: [[Bodmin Moor]], [[Dartmoor]] and [[Exmoor]] experience lower temperatures and more precipitation than the rest of the southwest (approximately twice as much rainfall as lowland areas), because of their high altitude. Both of these factors also cause it to experience the highest levels of snowfall and the lowest levels of sunshine. Exposed areas of the moors are windier than lowlands and can be almost as windy as the coast.\n\n===Regional identity===\nThe boundaries of the South West region are based upon those devised by central government in the 1930s for civil defence administration and subsequently used for various statistical analyses. The region is also similar to that used in the 17th-century [[Rule of the Major-Generals]] under [[Oliver Cromwell|Cromwell]]. (For further information, see [[Historical and alternative regions of England]]). By the 1960s, the South West region (including Dorset, which for some previous purposes had been included in a Southern region), was widely recognised for government administration and statistics. The boundaries were carried forward into the 1990s when regional administrations were formally established as Government Office Regions. A [[South West Regional Assembly|regional assembly]] and [[South West of England Regional Development Agency|regional development agency]] were created in 1999, then abolished in 2008 and 2012 respectively.\n\nIt has been argued that the official South West region does not possess a cultural and historic unity or identity of itself, which has led to criticism of it as an \"artificial\" construct. The large area of the region, stretching as it does from the Isles of Scilly to Gloucestershire, encompasses diverse areas which have little more in common with each other than they do with other areas of England. The region has several TV stations and newspapers based in different areas, and no single acknowledged regional \"capital\".  Many people of the region have some level of a 'South West', or 'West Country' regional identity, although this may not necessarily correspond to an identification with the official government-defined [[Regions of England|region]]. It is common for people in the region to identify at a national level (whether [[English nationalism|English]], [[British nationalism|British]], [[Cornish nationalism|Cornish]], and/or a county or city/town level). Identifying as being from 'the Westcountry', amorphous though it is, tends to be more predominant further into the peninsula where the status of being from the region is less equivocal.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/spp/publications/unit-publications/94.pdf | title=The Cornish Question: Devolution in the South-West Region | last=Sandford | first=Mark | publisher=UCL | accessdate=12 February 2011 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110221191805/http://www.ucl.ac.uk/spp/publications/unit-publications/94.pdf | archive-date=21 February 2011 | url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/13785851/Regional-Spaces-Spaces-of-Regionalism-Territory-Insurgent-Politics-and-the-English-Question |title=Regional Spaces: Spaces of Regionalism, Territory, Insurgent Politics and the English Question |publisher=Scribd.com |date=31 March 2009 |accessdate=24 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118042520/http://www.scribd.com/doc/13785851/Regional-Spaces-Spaces-of-Regionalism-Territory-Insurgent-Politics-and-the-English-Question |archive-date=18 January 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIn particular, [[Cornwall]]'s inclusion in the region is disputed by Cornish nationalists.<ref>{{cite web |author=Cornish Constitutional Convention |url=http://www.cornishassembly.org/caseforcornwall.htm |title=Campaign for a Cornish Assembly |publisher=Cornishassembly.org |accessdate=24 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310230049/http://www.cornishassembly.org/caseforcornwall.htm |archive-date=10 March 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> The cross-party [[Cornish Constitutional Convention]] and Cornish nationalist party [[Mebyon Kernow]] have campaigned for a [[Cornish Assembly]] ever since the idea of regional devolution was put forward.\n\n===Settlements===\n[[File:Pulteney Bridge, Bath 2.jpg|alt=A three arch stone bridge with buildings on it, over water.

''Place-Names of Devon'', 1932</ref>\n\nUntil the 19th century, the [[West Country]] and its dialects of the [[English language]] were largely protected from outside influences, due to its relative geographical isolation. The West Country dialects derive not from a corrupted form of modern English, but from the Southwestern dialects of [[Middle English]], which themselves derived from the dialects of the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of [[Wessex]]. [[Late West Saxon]], which formed the earliest English language standard, from the time of King Alfred until the late 11th century, is the form in which the majority of Anglo-Saxon texts are preserved. [[Thomas Spencer Baynes]] claimed in 1856 that, due to its position at the heart of the Kingdom of Wessex, the relics of Anglo-Saxon accent, idiom and vocabulary were best preserved in the Somerset dialect.

Exposed areas of the moors are windier than lowlands and can be almost as windy as the coast.\n\n===Regional identity===\nThe boundaries of the South West region are based upon those devised by central government in the 1930s for civil defence administration and subsequently used for various statistical analyses. The region is also similar to that used in the 17th-century [[Rule of the Major-Generals]] under [[Oliver Cromwell|Cromwell]]. (For further information, see [[Historical and alternative regions of England]]). By the 1960s, the South West region (including Dorset, which for some previous purposes had been included in a Southern region), was widely recognised for government administration and statistics. The boundaries were carried forward into the 1990s when regional administrations were formally established as Government Office Regions. A [[South West Regional Assembly|regional assembly]] and [[South West of England Regional Development Agency|regional development agency]] were created in 1999, then abolished in 2008 and 2012 respectively.\n\nIt has been argued that the official South West region does not possess a cultural and historic unity or identity of itself, which has led to criticism of it as an \"artificial\" construct. The large area of the region, stretching as it does from the Isles of Scilly to Gloucestershire, encompasses diverse areas which have little more in common with each other than they do with other areas of England. The region has several TV stations and newspapers based in different areas, and no single acknowledged regional \"capital\".  Many people of the region have some level of a 'South West', or 'West Country' regional identity, although this may not necessarily correspond to an identification with the official government-defined [[Regions of England|region]]. It is common for people in the region to identify at a national level (whether [[English nationalism|English]], [[British nationalism|British]], [[Cornish nationalism|Cornish]], and/or a county or city/town level). Identifying as being from 'the Westcountry', amorphous though it is, tends to be more predominant further into the peninsula where the status of being from the region is less equivocal.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/spp/publications/unit-publications/94.pdf | title=The Cornish Question: Devolution in the South-West Region | last=Sandford | first=Mark | publisher=UCL | accessdate=12 February 2011 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110221191805/http://www.ucl.ac.uk/spp/publications/unit-publications/94.pdf | archive-date=21 February 2011 | url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/13785851/Regional-Spaces-Spaces-of-Regionalism-Territory-Insurgent-Politics-and-the-English-Question |title=Regional Spaces: Spaces of Regionalism, Territory, Insurgent Politics and the English Question |publisher=Scribd.com |date=31 March 2009 |accessdate=24 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118042520/http://www.scribd.com/doc/13785851/Regional-Spaces-Spaces-of-Regionalism-Territory-Insurgent-Politics-and-the-English-Question |archive-date=18 January 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIn particular, [[Cornwall]]'s inclusion in the region is disputed by Cornish nationalists.<ref>{{cite web |author=Cornish Constitutional Convention |url=http://www.cornishassembly.org/caseforcornwall.htm |title=Campaign for a Cornish Assembly |publisher=Cornishassembly.org |accessdate=24 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310230049/http://www.cornishassembly.org/caseforcornwall.htm |archive-date=10 March 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> The cross-party [[Cornish Constitutional Convention]] and Cornish nationalist party [[Mebyon Kernow]] have campaigned for a [[Cornish Assembly]] ever since the idea of regional devolution was put forward.\n\n===Settlements===\n[[File:Pulteney Bridge, Bath 2.jpg|alt=A three arch stone bridge with buildings on it, over water.

In 1497, early in [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]]'s reign, the royal pretender [[Perkin Warbeck]], besieged Exeter.

The University of Plymouth has the largest teaching grant.\n\nOf the region's students (postgraduate and undergraduate), 50% are from the region, and around 40% from other regions.

Including the [[East of England]], around 70% are from [[Southern England]]. 10% are from the [[English Midlands|Midlands]], and 5% from [[Northern England]]. The main access for students from the north is the [[Cross Country Route]]. Around 33% of native South West students stay in the region, with 18% going to the South East (around 60% stay in the south of England). Around 14% go to Wales, but very few go to the East of England. Access by road or rail to the East of England region is not straightforward, with around the same amount of travel as to Scotland. Many more native South West students are prepared to go to the north of England, than northern students are prepared to study in the South West. Once graduated, around 50% stay in the region, with 15% each going to London or the South East (around 80% find work in the south of England).

Moreover, Hindus in 11th century India had suffered waves of destructive attacks on many of its cities, and Islamic armies had taken numerous Hindu slaves to Persia, which\u2014claimed Al-Biruni\u2014contributed to Hindus becoming suspicious of all foreigners, not just Muslims. Hindus considered Muslims violent and impure, and did not want to share anything with them. Over time, Al-Biruni won the welcome of Hindu scholars. Al-Biruni collected books and studied with these Hindu scholars to become fluent in Sanskrit, discover and translate into Arabic the mathematics, science, medicine, astronomy and other fields of arts as practiced in 11th-century India. He was inspired by the arguments offered by Indian scholars who believed earth must be globular in shape, which is the only way to fully explain the difference in daylight hours by latitude, seasons and earth's relative positions with moon and stars. At the same time, Al-Biruni was also critical of Indian scribes who he believed carelessly corrupted Indian documents while making copies of older documents.<ref>{{Cite book|last= B\u012br\u016bn\u012b |first=Mu\u1e25ammad ibn A\u1e25mad|date = 1910|title = Alberuni's India: An Account of the Religion, Philosophy, Literature, Geography, Chronology, Astronomy, Customs, Laws and Astrology of India about A.D. 1030|chapter = On the Hindus in General, as an Introduction to Our Account of Them|volume = 1|page = 17|publisher = Kegan Paul, Trench, Tr\u00fcbner|place = London|url = http://www.columbia.edu/cu/lweb/digital/collections/cul/texts/ldpd_5949073_001/|accessdate = |postscript = see also Vol 2 of Al-Biruni's India.}}</ref> He also criticized the Hindus on what he saw them do and not do, like their deficiencies in curiosity about history and religion.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\nOne of the specific aspects of Hindu life that Al-Biruni studied was the Hindu calendar.

He developed a method for converting the dates of the Hindu calendar to the dates of the three different calendars that were common in the Islamic countries of his time period, the Greek, the Arab/Muslim, and the Persian.

The work includes research on a vast array of topics of Indian culture, including descriptions of their traditions and customs. Although he tried to stay away from political and military history, Biruni did indeed record important dates and noted actual sites of where significant battles occurred. Additionally, he chronicled stories of Indian rulers and told of how they ruled over their people with their beneficial actions and acted in the interests of the nation. But, his details are brief and mostly just list rulers without referring to their real names. He did not go on about deeds that each one carried out during their reign, which keeps in line with Al-Biruni's mission to try to stay away from political histories. Al-Biruni also described the geography of India in his work. He documented different bodies of water and other natural phenomena. These descriptions are useful to today's modern historians because they are able to use Biruni's scholarship to locate certain destinations in modern-day India. Historians are able to make some matches while also concluding that certain areas seem to have disappeared and been replaced with different cities. Different forts and landmarks were able to be located, legitimizing Al-Biruni's contributions with their usefulness to even modern history and archeology.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\nThe dispassionate account of Hinduism given by Al-Biruni was remarkable for its time. He stated that he was fully objective in his writings, remaining unbiased like a proper historian should. Biruni documented everything about India just as it happened. But, he did note how some of the accounts of information that he was given by natives of the land may not have been reliable in terms of complete accuracy, however, he did try to be as honest as possible in his writing.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> Mohammad Yasin compares it to \"a magic island of quiet, impartial research in the midst of a world of clashing swords, burning towns, and plundered temples.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Yasin|first1=Mohammad|title=Reading in Indian history|date=1988|publisher=Atlantic Publishers & Distri|location=New Delhi, India|isbn=978-8-1715-6120-9|pages=19|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=hz4LJu1EqJIC|page=5}}|accessdate=22 June 2016}}</ref>\nBiruni's writing was very poetic, which may diminish some of the historical value of the work for modern times.

The phenomena of statics were studied by using the dynamic approach so that two trends \u2013 statics and dynamics \u2013 turned out to be inter-related within a single science, mechanics. The combination of the dynamic approach with Archimedean hydrostatics gave birth to a direction in science which may be called medieval hydrodynamics.

He studied [[Zoroastrianism]], [[Judaism]], [[Hinduism]], [[Christianity]], [[Buddhism]], [[Islam]], and other religions. He treated religions objectively, striving to understand them on their own terms rather than trying to prove them wrong. His underlying concept was that all cultures are at least distant relatives of all other cultures because they are all human constructs. \"What al-Biruni seems to be arguing is that there is a common human element in every culture that makes all cultures distant relatives, however foreign they might seem to one another.\"{{sfn|Rosenthal|1976|p=10}}\n\nAl-Biruni divides [[Hindus]] into an educated and an uneducated class. He describes the educated as monotheistic, believing that God is one, eternal, and omnipotent and eschewing all forms of idol worship. He recognizes that uneducated Hindus worshiped a multiplicity of idols yet points out that even some Muslims (such as the Jabiriyya) have adopted [[anthropomorphic]] concepts of God.{{sfn|Ataman|2005}}\n\n== Anthropology ==\n\nAl-Biruni wrote about the peoples, customs and religions of the Indian subcontinent.\nAccording to Akbar S. Ahmed, like modern anthropologists, he engaged in extensive participant observation with a given group of people, learnt their language and studied their primary texts, presenting his findings with objectivity and neutrality using cross-cultural comparisons.\nAkhbar S.

Biruni notes in the beginning of his book how the Muslims had a hard time learning about Hindu knowledge and culture.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> He explains that Hinduism and Islam are totally different from each other. Moreover, Hindus in 11th century India had suffered waves of destructive attacks on many of its cities, and Islamic armies had taken numerous Hindu slaves to Persia, which\u2014claimed Al-Biruni\u2014contributed to Hindus becoming suspicious of all foreigners, not just Muslims. Hindus considered Muslims violent and impure, and did not want to share anything with them. Over time, Al-Biruni won the welcome of Hindu scholars. Al-Biruni collected books and studied with these Hindu scholars to become fluent in Sanskrit, discover and translate into Arabic the mathematics, science, medicine, astronomy and other fields of arts as practiced in 11th-century India. He was inspired by the arguments offered by Indian scholars who believed earth must be globular in shape, which is the only way to fully explain the difference in daylight hours by latitude, seasons and earth's relative positions with moon and stars. At the same time, Al-Biruni was also critical of Indian scribes who he believed carelessly corrupted Indian documents while making copies of older documents.<ref>{{Cite book|last= B\u012br\u016bn\u012b |first=Mu\u1e25ammad ibn A\u1e25mad|date = 1910|title = Alberuni's India: An Account of the Religion, Philosophy, Literature, Geography, Chronology, Astronomy, Customs, Laws and Astrology of India about A.D. 1030|chapter = On the Hindus in General, as an Introduction to Our Account of Them|volume = 1|page = 17|publisher = Kegan Paul, Trench, Tr\u00fcbner|place = London|url = http://www.columbia.edu/cu/lweb/digital/collections/cul/texts/ldpd_5949073_001/|accessdate = |postscript = see also Vol 2 of Al-Biruni's India.}}</ref> He also criticized the Hindus on what he saw them do and not do, like their deficiencies in curiosity about history and religion.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\nOne of the specific aspects of Hindu life that Al-Biruni studied was the Hindu calendar. His scholarship on the topic exhibited great determination and focus, not to mention the excellence in his approach of the in-depth research he performed. He developed a method for converting the dates of the Hindu calendar to the dates of the three different calendars that were common in the Islamic countries of his time period, the Greek, the Arab/Muslim, and the Persian. Biruni also employed astronomy in the determination of his theories, which were complex mathematical equations and scientific calculation that allows one to convert dates and years between the different calendars.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kennedy |last2=Engle |last3=Wamstad|first1=E.S. |first2=Susan |first3=Jeanne|title=The Hindu Calendar as Described in Al-Biruni's Masudic Canon|url=\n{{google books |plainurl=y |id=_OLYMgEACAAJ}}|journal=Journal of Near Eastern Studies|date=1965|volume=24}}</ref>\n\nThe book does not limit itself to tedious records of battle because Al-Biruni found the social culture to be more important. The work includes research on a vast array of topics of Indian culture, including descriptions of their traditions and customs. Although he tried to stay away from political and military history, Biruni did indeed record important dates and noted actual sites of where significant battles occurred. Additionally, he chronicled stories of Indian rulers and told of how they ruled over their people with their beneficial actions and acted in the interests of the nation. But, his details are brief and mostly just list rulers without referring to their real names. He did not go on about deeds that each one carried out during their reign, which keeps in line with Al-Biruni's mission to try to stay away from political histories. Al-Biruni also described the geography of India in his work. He documented different bodies of water and other natural phenomena. These descriptions are useful to today's modern historians because they are able to use Biruni's scholarship to locate certain destinations in modern-day India. Historians are able to make some matches while also concluding that certain areas seem to have disappeared and been replaced with different cities. Different forts and landmarks were able to be located, legitimizing Al-Biruni's contributions with their usefulness to even modern history and archeology.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\nThe dispassionate account of Hinduism given by Al-Biruni was remarkable for its time. He stated that he was fully objective in his writings, remaining unbiased like a proper historian should. Biruni documented everything about India just as it happened. But, he did note how some of the accounts of information that he was given by natives of the land may not have been reliable in terms of complete accuracy, however, he did try to be as honest as possible in his writing.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> Mohammad Yasin compares it to \"a magic island of quiet, impartial research in the midst of a world of clashing swords, burning towns, and plundered temples.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Yasin|first1=Mohammad|title=Reading in Indian history|date=1988|publisher=Atlantic Publishers & Distri|location=New Delhi, India|isbn=978-8-1715-6120-9|pages=19|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=hz4LJu1EqJIC|page=5}}|accessdate=22 June 2016}}</ref>\nBiruni's writing was very poetic, which may diminish some of the historical value of the work for modern times.
