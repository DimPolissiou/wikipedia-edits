He was professor emeritus at PSTA and served as director of research.<ref>[http://www.psta.org.uk/about/trusteesandstaff/ Prince's School of Traditional Arts \u2013 Trustees and Staff] \"Dr Keith Critchlow, Professor Emeritus, Founder, and Director of Research\"</ref> He also taught at [[The Prince's Foundation for the Built Environment]].\n\nIn 1983, Critchlow was asked by Indian philosopher and author [[Jiddu Krishnamurti]] to design the [[Jiddu Krishnamurti|Krishnamurti]] Study Centre in Hampshire, UK, which was completed in 1986.<ref>[http://www.krishnamurticentre.org.uk/ The Krishnamurti Centre in England]</ref> His other architectural works include, the Lindisfarne Chapel in [[Crestone, Colorado|Crestone]], Colorado, in the United States with a special design for the vaulting of the dome,<ref>[http://www.dharmasangha.org/location.html#Dome Creston Mountain Zen Center] \u2013 location and history of the dome Lindisfarne Chapel</ref> and a hospital, the [[Sathya Sai Baba|Sri Sathya Sai]] Institute of Higher Medical Sciences in [[Puttaparthi|Puttaparthi, India]]. [[Isaac Tigrett]], who had founded the [[Hard Rock Cafe]] enterprise, secured Critchlow's expertise to design the hospital in Puttuparthi.<ref>Lerwill, John, [http://www.lerwill-life.org.uk/spirit/sai.htm \"Who is Sai\"]</ref> His use of sacred geometry played a major role in these architectural designs and projects.\n\nCritchlow made an important contribution to the re-construction of the Minbar of Saladin in the al-Aqsa Mosque, Jerusalem. The minbar was destroyed by fire in 1969 following an arson attack by an evangelical Christian. King Hussein of Jordan launched a 30-year search, including international competitions, to find a sufficiently qualified person to re-design the intricate patterns of the minbar. The competition was finally won by Dr Minwer Al-Meheid<ref>{{Cite book|last=Meehan|first=Mark W.|title=Islam, Modernity, and the Liminal Space Between|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|year=2013|isbn=|location=Newcastle Upon Tyne|pages=96-97}}</ref> who was inspired to make his submission after spending a year studying Critchlow's work:<blockquote>\"Seemingly, the ancient knowledge of how to map the structure geometrically had been lost. Until, that is, Minwer al-Meheid, an engineer from Jordan, walked into a bookshop in Damascus and fell upon a work that contained the answers. It was ''Islamic Patterns'', a pioneering and seminal study of the geometry underpinning Islamic art, by Keith Critchlow.\" '''Resurgence & Ecologist Magazine, 2015'''.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Skelly|first=Ian|date=2015|title=A Treasure Cave of Sacred Geometry|url=https://www.resurgence.org/magazine/article4334-a-treasure-cave-of-sacred-geometry.html|journal=Resurgence & Ecologist|volume=288|pages=|via=}}</ref></blockquote>The story of the re-construction of the Minbar of Saladin is told in a documentary film ''Stairway to Heaven''. \n\nCritchlow was president of the [[Temenos Academy]]<ref>[http://www.temenosacademy.org/temenos_key_individuals.html Temenos Academy] \u2013 key individuals: Patron: His Royal Highness The Prince of Wales, President: Professor Keith Critchlow, Chairman: Sir Nicholas Pearson, Bt.</ref>, a co-founder of Research into Lost Knowledge RILKO and founder of Kairos, an educational charity which investigates, studies, and promotes traditional values in art and science.

He served as the chairman and [[chief executive officer]] (CEO) of the [[Starbucks|Starbucks Coffee Corporation]] for more than two decades; first from 1986 to 2000, and then from 2008 to 2017. After stepping down as CEO, Schultz stayed at the company from 2017 to 2018 as its executive chairman overseeing Starbuck's philanthropic and charitable giving arm. From 2001 to 2006, he owned the [[Seattle SuperSonics]], a basketball franchise that he sold for [[United States dollar|US$]]350 million to [[Clay Bennett (businessman)|Clay Bennett]], who moved the team to Oklahoma creating the [[Oklahoma City Thunder]]. <!--The lack of citations is purposeful.

After briefly selling office equipment door-to-door one of his early clients, the then coffeehouse startup Starbucks, onboarded him as their marketing head in 1982. A business trip to [[Milan|Milan, Italy]] and [[Coffee in Italy|the city's coffee culture]] inspired him to open ''Il Giornale'', a specialty coffeeshop that quickly merged with Starbucks during the late-1980s. Shultz pushed the new company to sell more than [[Coffee bean|coffee beans]] and equipment, quickly establishing a large network of stores that served [[espresso]], [[coffee]], teas, and casual food. Following large-scale distribution deals \u2013 particularly with major hotels, groceries, and bookstores \u2013 Starbucks became [[List of coffeehouse chains|the largest coffee-house chain]] in the world.<!--Cited in body.--> Shultz took the company [[Initial public offering|public]] in 1992 and used a $271 million valuation to double their store count. He stepped down in 2000 to focus on Starbuck's international expansion, succeeded by [[Orin C. Smith|Orin Smith]].<!--Second tenure as CEO, 2008 to 2017.-->\n\nDuring the [[Financial crisis of 2007\u201308|2008 financial crisis]], Schultz returned as chief executive to stabilize the company after years of unsustainable growth. He led a mass-firing of executives, shuttered hundreds of weak stores, and temporarily closed all U.S. stores to retrain employees in making espresso. Shultz orchestrated multiple [[Mergers and acquisitions|acquisitions]] of American and Chinese beverage companies and introduced a national [[loyalty program]].

He served as the chairman and [[chief executive officer]] (CEO) of the [[Starbucks|Starbucks Coffee Corporation]] for more than two decades; first from 1986 to 2000, and then from 2008 to 2017. After stepping down as CEO, Schultz stayed at the company from 2017 to 2018 as its executive chairman overseeing Starbuck's philanthropic and charitable giving arm. From 2001 to 2006, he owned the [[Seattle SuperSonics]], a basketball franchise that he sold for [[United States dollar|US$]]350 million to [[Clay Bennett (businessman)|Clay Bennett]], who moved the team to Oklahoma creating the [[Oklahoma City Thunder]]. <!--The lack of citations is purposeful.

After briefly selling office equipment door-to-door one of his early clients, the then coffeehouse startup Starbucks, onboarded him as their marketing head in 1982. A business trip to [[Milan|Milan, Italy]] and [[Coffee in Italy|the city's coffee culture]] inspired him to open ''Il Giornale'', a specialty coffeeshop that quickly merged with Starbucks during the late-1980s. Shultz pushed the new company to sell more than [[Coffee bean|coffee beans]] and equipment, quickly establishing a large network of stores that served [[espresso]], [[coffee]], teas, and casual food. Following large-scale distribution deals \u2013 particularly with major hotels, groceries, and bookstores \u2013 Starbucks became [[List of coffeehouse chains|the largest coffee-house chain]] in the world.<!--Cited in body.--> Shultz took the company [[Initial public offering|public]] in 1992 and used a $271 million valuation to double their store count. He stepped down in 2000 to focus on Starbuck's international expansion, succeeded by [[Orin C. Smith|Orin Smith]].<!--Second tenure as CEO, 2008 to 2017.-->\n\nDuring the [[Financial crisis of 2007\u201308|2008 financial crisis]], Schultz returned as chief executive to stabilize the company after years of unsustainable growth. He led a mass-firing of executives, shuttered hundreds of weak stores, and temporarily closed all U.S. stores to retrain employees in making espresso. Shultz orchestrated multiple [[Mergers and acquisitions|acquisitions]] of American and Chinese beverage companies and introduced a national [[loyalty program]]. His aggressive expansion in Chinese markets has been credited with reconciling [[Chinese tea culture|the country's tea-culture]] with [[Coffee production in China|coffee consumption in China]]. Schultz's positioning of Starbucks as a social hub is widely seen as introducing [[Third wave of coffee#History|the second wave]] of coffee culture in the U.S., particularly in Seattle. His second tenure sustained both [[Criticism of Starbucks|significant criticism]] and growth, ultimately adding nearly $100 billion in [[market capitalization]] to the company, a 21,000% increase in [[shareholder value]]. <!--Cited in body.-->Schultz was succeeded by [[Kevin Johnson (executive)|Kevin Johnson]] as CEO in April 2017, and has, since 2018, retained the title \"Chairman emeritus\" of Starbucks. \n\nSchultz was named the [[The World's Billionaires|145th-richest person in the United States]] by ''Forbes'' in 2019 with a [[net worth]] of $4.1 billion (November 2019).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/howard-schultz/#6de1621452c6|title=Howard Schultz|website=Forbes|access-date=April 2, 2019|language=en}}</ref> He is the author of [[Howard Schultz#Books|three books]], ''Pour Your Heart Into It'' (1997), ''Onward'' (2011), and ''From the Ground Up'' (2019). Long known for his outspoken [[Centrism|centrist]], moderate, and independent political views, Schultz explored a run in the [[2020 United States presidential election]] as an independent candidate but declined to formally join the contest for fear of re-electing [[Donald Trump]]. Schultz supports nonpartisan immigration policy, [[free trade]], [[Balanced budget|fiscal discipline]], comprehensive tax reform, gun control, same-sex marriage, and more generally, [[bipartisanship]] across the political spectrum.

He learned that they not only served excellent [[espresso]], they also served as meeting places or public squares; the 200,000 caf\u00e9s in the country were an important element of Italian culture and society.[[File:Howard-Schultz-Starbucks.jpg|thumb|250x250px|Shultz speaking with press about Starbucks' presence in Canada, 2007.|alt=|left]]On his return, he tried to persuade the owners (including cofounder [[Jerry Baldwin]]) to offer traditional espresso beverages in addition to the whole bean coffee, leaf teas and spices they had long offered. After a successful pilot of the cafe concept, the owners refused to roll it out company-wide, saying they did not want to get into the restaurant business. Frustrated, Schultz decided to leave Starbucks in 1985. He needed $400,000 to open the first store and start the business. He did not have the money and his wife was pregnant with their first baby. Jerry Baldwin and Starbucks cofounder [[Gordon Bowker]] offered to help. Schultz also received $100,000 from a doctor who was impressed by Schultz's energy to \"take a gamble\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Mullins|first=John|title=The New Business Road Test|url=https://archive.org/details/newbusinessroadt0000mull|url-access=registration|year=2007}}</ref> By 1986, he had raised all the money he needed to open the first store, \"Il Giornale\", named after [[Il Giornale|the Milanese newspaper]] of the same name. The store offered ice cream in addition to coffee, had little seating, and played opera music in the background to portray an Italian experience. Two years later, the original Starbucks management decided to focus on [[Peet's Coffee & Tea]] and sold its Starbucks retail unit to Schultz and Il Giornale for US$3.8&nbsp;million.\n\nSchultz renamed ''Il Giornale'' with the Starbucks name, and aggressively expanded its reach across the United States. Schultz's insight in real estate and his hard-line focus on growth drove him to expand the company rapidly. Schultz did not believe in [[franchising]], and made a point of having Starbucks retain ownership of every domestic outlet.

Vertigo Gallery, London, {{ISBN|1-903771-08-0}}.</ref> This composed physical presence was inherent in even the most restrained of Butcher's works, as William Packer would go on to say in his introduction to Butcher's 2005 catalogue, Carbon Candy, \u2018even when hung conventionally, flat to the wall, they remain obviously and directly physical\u2019.<ref>\u201dCarbon Candy\u201d, p.4.

The introduction of metal as a support revolutionised Butcher's creative output and his approach to the act of painting, \u2018it may just be a flat piece of metal\u2026 But they all have little nicks, edges and imperfections\u2026 the end result is an accumulation of what I have learnt about that surface\u2019.<ref name=\"Arcs\" />\n[[File:Eric Butcher, ER.358.jpg|thumb|left|alt=ER.358.|ER.358 Oil and resin on extruded aluminium box sections.]]\n===Philosophy and approach to painting===\n\u2018The application or subtraction of paint\u2019 in Butcher's practice is executed through the use of \u2018a metal blade drawn across the painting\u2019s surface\u2019<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\">\u201dDefinite Article, Objects and Surfaces, Eric Butcher\u201d, p.7.

Although Butcher has a uniform approach to each work,<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" /> they nevertheless differ vastly from one another as the artist may encounter subtle material differences in the surface of each extrusion; burrs in the metal itself or unexpected variations in the applied paint wash.<ref>Sheldon, Julie (2007). \u201cUnderground\u201d, p.32. Centre for Art International Research, Liverpool, {{ISBN|978-0-9552820-6-5}}.</ref> Almost every piece will seek to preserve some element of the metal as well, \u2018the aluminium asserts itself as the artwork\u2019s true substance\u2019.<ref name=\"Baker\" /> As Butcher seeks to articulate the surfaces of aluminium structures,<ref name=\"ericbutcher\" /> he does so not only through the repetitive layers of colour application, but also through the preservation of the support's original condition (before his intervention) \u2013 both make for an overall representation of that particular structure's history.\n\nFor the Material Witness exhibition at Toomey Tourell gallery in 2010, Butcher exhibited fourteen of his painted aluminium extrusions.<ref name=\"Baker\">Baker, Kenneth (March 13, 2010). \u201cButcher Shines at Toomey Tourell\u201d.

In his first spell at Deepdale Ellis scored 32 goals in 106 games in a little over two seasons.\n\n===Stoke City===\nIn 1989 [[Alan Ball, Jr.|Alan Ball]] at [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] tabled a \u00a3250,000 offer for Ellis. For Preston, the money was too good to turn down, and Ellis found himself leaving for the [[Victoria Ground]] in December 1989. His time at Stoke was disrupted by injury, but in two and a half years he scored 20 goals in 93 first-team appearances.\n\n===Back at Preston===\nIn August 1992, Preston came back for him, paying Stoke \u00a350,000 plus striker [[Graham Shaw (footballer born 1967)|Graham Shaw]]. Stoke valued Ellis at \u00a3250,000 while Preston valued Shaw at \u00a3200,000. This deal therefore meant that Ellis became Preston's record signing at the time. His second spell at Preston was even more productive than his first: Ellis scored 56 goals in only 88 games and was named the club's official [[Preston North End Player of the Year Award Winners|player of the year]] in 1992/93 and 1993/94. His final game for ''the Lilywhites'' was their 1994 play-off final defeat against [[Wycombe Wanderers F.C.|Wycombe Wanderers]] at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]].\n\n===Blackpool===\nAfter a much-publicised fall out with Preston boss [[John Beck (footballer)|John Beck]] over a new contract and his role within the club, Ellis signed for [[West Lancashire derby|arch-rivals]] [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]] for \u00a3165,000 in 1994. However, in November 1995 Ellis handed in a transfer request fueling rumours of a return to Deepdale, by then managed by [[Gary Peters (footballer)|Gary Peters]]. Blackpool got around this problem by offering Ellis an extension to his contract. In three and a half years at [[Bloomfield Road]], Ellis scored 65 goals in 173 games.\n\n===Latter career===\nIn December 1997, Ellis was on the move again, this time to [[Bury F.C.|Bury]] for \u00a370,000. He scored twelve goals in 38 games at [[Gigg Lane]]. Then in 1999 he joined [[Stockport County F.C.|Stockport County]] for a fee of \u00a325,000. He made 21 league appearances, scoring six goals before joining [[Rochdale F.C.|Rochdale]] on a free transfer later that year. He made a total of 68 appearance and scored 18 goals.\n\nHe was released by Rochdale at the end of the 2000\u201301 season, and found himself without a club and semi-retirement and a return to non-league football looked likely until [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] boss [[Stan Ternent]] offered him a lifeline. In his only season at [[Turf Moor]], Ellis played ten games, all as a substitute. At the age of 37 he scored the winner against [[Bradford City F.C.|Bradford City]] in a 3\u20132 win at [[Valley Parade]], his only goal for the club. During his Football League career Ellis had scored 210 goals in 609 first team games.\n\n===Non-League===\nAfter leaving Burnley at the end of the 2001\u201302 season, Ellis joined [[Football Conference]] side [[Leigh Genesis F.C.|Leigh RMI]]. In 2003, he joined [[Northern Premier League]] side [[Mossley A.F.C.|Mossley]].<ref>[http://www.mossleyweb.com/MwebFrameset0809.htm Mossley stats] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100318104154/http://www.mossleyweb.com/MwebFrameset0809.htm |date=18 March 2010 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2003\u201304 he became player/assistant manager of [[Conference North]] club [[Hyde United F.C.|Hyde United]] and also took on the role of coaching the Burnley under-15s at the Turf Moor club's Centre of Excellence.\n\n==Coaching career==\nIn July 2007, Ellis left his position as assistant manager of Hyde United and coach of the youth teams at Turf Moor to join former teammate, [[Rochdale A.F.C.|Rochdale]] manager [[Keith Hill (footballer)|Keith Hill]], as Head of Youth at Spotland.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/r/rochdale/6741623.stm - \"Rochdale bring in two ex-players\" - BBC Sport]</ref><ref>[http://www.rochdaleafc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/CentreOfExcellence/0,,10441~1078082,00.html \"Legend is back\" - RochdaleAFC.co.uk]</ref>\n\nSince May 2013, Ellis has been appointed as both Academy Manager and First Team Matchday Observational Coach, which will ensure a bridge between Dale's youth system and the first team.<ref>[http://www.rochdaleafc.co.uk/news/article/backroomstaff-825457.aspx \"Team Behind The Team\" - RochdaleAFC.co.uk]</ref>\n\n==Blackpool F.C.

At the [[Battle of the Little Bighorn]] in the [[Crow Indian Reservation]],<ref>Kappler, Charles J.: Indian Affairs. Laws and Treaties. Washington, 1904. Vol. 2, p. 1008: Treaty with the Crows,1868.</ref> White Swan went with Major [[Marcus Reno|Reno]]'s detachment, and fought alongside the soldiers at the south end of the village. Of the six Crow scouts at the [[Battle of the Little Bighorn]], White Swan stands out because he aggressively sought combat with multiple Sioux and Cheyenne warriors, and he was the only Crow Scout to be wounded in action, suffering severe wounds to his hand/wrist and leg/foot. After being disabled by his wounds, he was taken to Reno's hill entrenchments by [[Half Yellow Face, Crow Indian|Half Yellow Face]], the pipe-bearer (leader) of the [[Crow Indian|Crow]] scouts, which no doubt saved his life.\n\nOn the 27th, after the battle, Half Yellow Face made a special horse [[travois]] for White Swan and moved him down the Little Horn valley to the ''Far West'' steamship, moored at the junction of the Bighorn River and the Little Horn, so he could get medical care from army physicians. White Swan was treated in a temporary Army hospital at the junction of the Bighorn and Yellowstone rivers. At the Crow encampments on Pryor Creek, other returning scouts reported that White Swan had died, but he survived his wounds.\n\nFollowing the Battle of the Little Bighorn, White Swan continued for five years (1876 to 1881) to serve as a scout with the U.S. Army, though he was significantly disabled. He had a severely deformed right wrist and hand, and he limped from the wound in his foot/leg from wounds received in the Battle of the Little Bighorn.  In photographs, White Swan also had a scar on his forehead where he had been struck with a war club in a separate battle with a Sioux warrior. Either from this blow or from other sources, White Swan could not hear and thus was unable to speak in his later life.  Eventually, he was awarded a small army [[pension]].\n\nIn White Swan's later life, he lived at the [[Crow Agency]], after it had been moved in 1884 to its present site in the [[Little Bighorn river|Little Bighorn]] valley in [[Montana]], close to the site of the battlefield. When he could no longer be an Army scout, White Swan began to produce drawings that represented key events in his life, including events of the Battle of the Little Bighorn. These drawings were bought by visitors to the Crow Agency and the nearby Custer Battlefield, providing White Swan with a welcome source of income. These drawings have now been discovered by collectors and their artistic value has been recognized. They have recently become the subject of collectors, exhibitions, books and university theses, and prints of his drawings are now commercially produced.\n\nWhile living at Crow Agency, White Swan was painted by the artist [[Joseph Henry Sharp|J.H. Sharp]], who knew him and described him as \"Jolly, good natured and a general favorite.\"<ref name=Sharp />  White Swan's wife had died when he was only 23 before he became an army scout, and he did not remarry.  He lived for a time with an aunt, \"Strikes By The Side Of The Water\" who was also the mother of [[Curly (scout)|Curly]], another Crow scout, and he and Curly were known in the Crow Agency community as brothers, though their personalities were said to be the opposite of each other.\n\nHe died in 1904, leaving no direct descendants. He is buried in the National Cemetery at the Little Bighorn Battlefield. Although his early death and his inability to hear and speak left him out of the limelight that later fell on the other surviving Crow scouts, his outstanding bravery during the battle and his artistic ability established an enduring legacy.

Cambridge, 1995, p. 106.</ref> From the point of the Crows in 1876 finally something was going to be done.\n\nHowever the [[Great Sioux War of 1876]] started because the U.S. Government also had its own larger [[agenda]]. [[Gold]] had been found in 1873 in the [[Black Hills]] on reservation lands granted the Sioux tribe by the [[Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868)]] and by 1875 a full scale gold rush was underway.  Ever increasing numbers of gold seekers were encroaching on Sioux lands in the Black Hills and established multiple mining centers and boom towns.  Being on the Sioux Reservation, these towns and mines were completely outside and apart from territorial governmental structure exercised by the U.S. in the rest of the west resulting in, among other things, random or non existent law and order activities due to the absence of federal law jurisdiction, and federal marshals, courts and judges.  Also critical was the impact of the economic [[panic of 1873]] which had left workers unemployed and the dollar devalued, and the U.S. economy could be improved by bringing the increasing and significant output of gold from the Black Hills under the U.S. Government's immediate control and jurisdiction.  The U.S. Government had tried unsuccessfully in 1875 to bring the Sioux living on the reservations to a conference to consider modifying the [[Fort Laramie Treaty (1868)|1868 Fort Laramie Treaty]] by ceding the Black Hills back to the U.S.  However in Article XII of the that treaty any modification of treaty lands required the agreement of 3/4 of the tribe's adult males, and there were large bands of \"off reservation\" Sioux (including influential leaders like [[Sitting Bull]], [[Crazy Horse]], [[Touch the Clouds]], [[Spotted Elk]], [[Spotted Tail]], [[Gall]] and others) who did not reside on the reservations and who also did not want to cede the Black Hills back to federal control.  These bands lived year round in their traditional migratory way on a vast hunting preserves given them by Article XVI of the [[Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868)]] which included the lands extending from the Black Hills across the entire Powder River Basin to the crest of the Big Horn Mountains.  In November 1875, the U.S. Government sent out an impossible ultimatum to these bands -- to leave their winter camps in the hunting preserve and immediately, in the dead of winter, return to their agencies in the Dakota Territories. When this predictably did not occur, in early 1876 the Government directed army columns to converge from the south, east and west on these \"off reservation\" Sioux bands in their encampments in southern Montana Territory with orders to bring the \"off reservation\" Sioux back to their agencies, by force if necessary. \n\nOne such column commanded by Col. [[John Gibbon]] was instructed to proceed from Ft. Ellis, near present day Bozeman, Montana down the Yellowstone River and take up a position in southern Montana Territory to block the \"off reservation\" Sioux from crossing north of the Yellowstone River.  In furtherance of this mission, on April 9, 1876, Col. [[John Gibbon]] went with Lt. James Bradley to the Crow Indian Agency, which was then located on the Stillwater River Drainage in Montana, to recruit Indian scouts.<ref name=Gray1>{{cite book|last=Gray|first=John S.|title=Centennial Campaign, the Sioux War of 1876|year=1988|publisher=Oklahoma Press|isbn=9780806121529|pages=320\u2013340}}</ref> In an embarrassing two-hour council the chiefs of the Mountain Crows expressed their reluctance to help the expedition. They pointed out that Indian warriors traveled light and fast and struck quickly, but the soldiers marched slowly with wagons and thus never found the enemy.<ref name=Gray1 />\n\nFortunately for Gibbon the young Crow braves didn't follow the elder's advice, and sought adventure.  On April 10, 1876 some twenty five Crows were enlisted for six months in the 7th Infantry by Lt. James Bradley, chief of scouts,<ref name=Gray1 /> including White Swan and Half Yellow Face.<ref name=American-Tribes>{{cite web|title=White Swan -- Crow|url=http://american-tribes.com/wordpress/tag/white-swan|publisher=American-Tribes.com|accessdate=21 May 2013}}</ref>  On April 13, 1876, the Crow Scouts went with Gibbon's 7th Infantry force of 477 persons, as they marched down the Yellowstone to the mouth of the Bighorn River, arriving on April 20.  Gibbon then moved downstream along the Yellowstone from the Bighorn to [[Rosebud Creek]]<ref name=Gray1 />  The Crow Scouts skirmished with Sioux scouts as the Sioux village passed from [[Tongue River (Montana)|Tongue River]] to the Rosebud valley in May 1876.<ref name=Gray1 />  Gibbon's column rendezvoused at the mouth of Rosebud Creek on June 21, 1876 with General [[Alfred Terry]]'s column, which included the 7th Cavalry under General [[George A. Custer]], which had come from the east.<ref name=Gray1 />\n\n==== Scouting activities with Custer's 7th Cavalry leading up to the Battle of the Little Bighorn ====\n\nOn June 21, White Swan was detached from the 7th Infantry to go with the 7th Cavalry,<ref name=Tomahawk /> along with five other Crow Scouts who were Half Yellow Face (leader of the Crow Scouts), White Man Runs Him, Goes Ahead, Hairy Moccasin, and Curley. The 7th Cavalry, under the command of Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custer, were ordered by General Terry to follow the trail of a large encampment of \"off-reservation\" Sioux who lived nomadic lives off the [[Great Sioux Reservation]]<ref>Kappler, Charles J.: Indian Affairs. Laws and Treaties. Washington, 1904, Vol. 2, pp. 998-1003.</ref> in present South Dakota. This group was making an annual westward spring migration from their camp on the Powder River valley to the Tongue and then to the Rosebud Valley, and on to the Little Bighorn.<ref name=Gray1 />  Custer was ordered to locate the encampment of these \"off reservation\" Sioux on the Rosebud Creek, or in the adjacent Little Bighorn Valley, around 20 miles (30&nbsp;km) inside the eastern border of the Crow Indian reservation.<ref>Kappler, Charles J.: Indian Affairs.

As far back as 1805 records indicated fur trader Francois-Antoine Larocque had camped with a band of Crows in what was later determined to be Little Bighorn River.<ref>Wood, Raymond W. and Thomas D.

This boundary area was a sort of no-mans land with both Sioux and Crows hunting on it, and warriors from both tribes crossing it to raid and steal horses from each other. \n\nThe six Crow scouts joined Custer on June 21. \"They are magnificent-looking men, so much handsomer and more Indian-like than any we have ever seen, and so jolly and sportive ... \" wrote Custer to his wife, [[Elizabeth Bacon Custer|Elizabeth B. Custer]].<ref name=\"Custer, Elizabeth B. 1968, p. 275\">Custer, Elizabeth B.: \"Boots and Saddles\" or, Life in Dakota with General Custer. Norman, 1968, p. 275.</ref> He also pointed out, why it was important to get them connected to the U.S. Army, \"I now have some Crow scouts with me, as they are familiar with the country.\"<ref name=\"Custer, Elizabeth B. 1968, p. 275\"/> Charles A. Varnum spelled it out in his reminiscences, \"These Crows were in their own country.\"<ref>Varnum, Charles A.: Custer's Chief of Scouts. The Reminiscences of Charles A. Varnum. Including his Testimony at the Reno Court of Inquiry. Lincoln,1987, p. 60.</ref>\n\nSince this was their ancestral homeland, the Crow scouts were relied on to undertake important scouting assignments for Custer in the days after June 21 leading up to the Battle of the Little Bighorn on June 25.\n\nWhen Custer struck the trail of the \"off reservation\" Sioux the scouts' count of 400 to 450 lodges in the encampment<ref name=Gray1 /><ref name=\"Philbrick\">{{cite book|last1=Philbrick|first1=Nathanial|title=The Last Stand|date=2010|publisher=Penguin Group|location=375 Hudson Street, New York, New York 10014|isbn=978-0-670-02172-7|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780670021727}}</ref> confirmed army sources indicting an \"off reservation\" nomadic group of about 800 warriors. This compared favorably to Custer's force of about 600 troopers.  However this initial assessment on June 21 was made on encampments dating back to May 21, when the Sioux/Cheyenne crossed from the Tongue River to the Rosebud Valley.<ref name=Gray1 />  As the scouts followed this trail up the Rosebud, past Lame Deer Creek and then on to the divide with the Little Horn Valley, they found the older trail increasingly joined and overlaid by many newer trails.  These newer trails were left by many other bands of Sioux/Cheyenne coming from the reservations to join the original \"off-reservation\" Sioux for their yearly summer gathering.<ref name=Gray1 /> Although not appreciated at the time, these late arriving bands of Sioux/Cheyenne swelled the encampment from 400 to about 960 lodges, able to field close to 2000 warriors.<ref name=Gray1 />\n\nCuster's prior experience in pursuing other Indian bands indicated that an Indian group would scatter if they knew they were being pursued.<ref name=Gray1 />  Custer used the Crows to check these trails to rule out a dispersal of the encampment he was following.  Custer tended to disregard the Crow scouts' intelligence that more and more Indians were gathering together.<ref name=Gray1 />\n\nOn the early morning of June 25, 1876, White Swan and other Crow Scouts ascended a high point on the divide between the Little Bighorn River and Rosebud Creek.<ref name=Tomahawk />  From this lookout point (which later became known as the \"Crow's Nest\") the scouts saw very large horse herds on the western margins of the Little Bighorn Valley, some 15 air miles away.  These large horse herds indicated an unexpectedly large Sioux/Cheyenne encampment. The encampment itself was out of sight on the valley floor.\n\nThe Crow scouts questioned the wisdom of attacking such a large encampment.  However, Custer was focused on his concern that his force had been detected that morning by Sioux scouts, and he feared that if he did not attack at once, the large encampment would break up into many smaller bands which would scatter in all directions, thus escaping and avoiding the decisive engagement the army hoped for. Custer therefore made plans for an immediate attack, and as he proceeded down Reno Creek toward the Little Bighorn Valley, he created four separate detachments, intended to prevent the encampment from scattering, and to strike the village from different directions. Reno with three troops would attack the south end of the village.  Custer with five troops would attack the north end of the village, and Benteen with 3 troops would scout briefly to the south, and then join the battle to assist the other detachments; Lt. McDougall's remaining troop would act as rear guard protecting the pack train.\n\n==== Wounded in action at the Battle of the Little Bighorn ====\nBefore the battle started, the scout White Swan watched the Lakota camp through a handheld telescope with his [[Horses in warfare|warhorse]] standing close by - this exact moment would later be a favorite scene of the artist White Swan to illustrate.<ref>Cowles, David C.: White Swan. Crow Artist at the Little Big Horn. ''American Indian Art Magazine'', Vol. 7, No. 4 (1982), pp. 52-61, p. 55.</ref>\n\nAs the Battle of the Little Bighorn unfolded White Swan and the chief Crow Scout Half Yellow Face, along with Arikara scouts accompanied the detachment under Major Reno.<ref name=Tomahawk />  The Indian scouts were told to stampede the horse herd on the western margins of the camp.  Reno's detachment charged the south end of the village as ordered, but as warriors poured out to defend the village Reno ordered the troops to dismount and form a skirmish line.  This outpouring of Sioux warriors frustrated the plan of the scouts to stampede the horse herd, and the scouts, including White Swan and Half Yellow Face began to fight alongside the cavalrymen. They were soon engaged in furious combat with swiftly increasing numbers of Sioux and Cheyenne warriors.<ref name=Thackery />  At one time, White Swan was faced by six warriors.\n\nAs more warriors swarmed out of the village, Reno's detachment pulled back into a patch of nearby timber along the river. After taking more losses in the timber, Reno ordered a retreat out of the timber and across the river and up onto the bluffs on the east side of the valley.  By the time Reno had ordered the retreat across the river White Swan had suffered severe bullet wounds in the right hand/wrist and in his foot, knee or leg (reports differ),<ref name=Thackery /><ref name=HYF>{{cite web|title=Half Yellow Face, Crow|url=http://www.american-tribes.com/Crow/bio/HalfYellowFace.htm|publisher=American-Tribes.com|accessdate=24 May 2013}}</ref> and he also couldn't hear, either from being hit on the head with a war club or because a rifle was fired to close to his ear (reports differ).<ref name=Sharp>{{cite book|last=Riebeth|first=Carolyn Reynolds|title=J.

Back in the timber, Half Yellow Face got the wounded White Swan on a horse and shielded by the timber, waited until the mass of Sioux warriors had turned their attention to Custer's column, now approaching the north end of the village, after which Yellow Face led the horse across the river and up the bluffs to the location where the Reno detachment was digging in,<ref name=HYF /> and where they were later reinforced by the other detachments under Captain Benteen and Lieutenant McDougall. This action by Half Yellow Face probably saved White Swan's life.  Troopers with Reno later recounted how White Swan, though wounded wanted to continue fighting, and disabled as he was tried to crawl back to the firing lines.<ref name=Thackery />\n\nAfter Reno's men fled across the river the now thoroughly aroused and mobilized Sioux/Cheyenne drew back, and then launched a fresh attack to the north on Custer's separate detachment of five companies (about 210 men) who were now firing into north end of the village.  At this point the Sioux outnumbered Custer's men by about 8 to 1. Custer's detachment was first driven back to a low ridge east of the valley, and then overwhelmed and wiped out to the last man.  This intense engagement lasted about an hour during the afternoon of June 25, 1876, after which the warriors returned to press the attack on Reno's entrenched position on the bluffs.  The next day, June 26, the Sioux continued the attack on the beleaguered Reno contingent, where White Swan lay in the section for the wounded.  However Sioux scouts reported the approach from the north of the large army column under Generals Terry and Gibbon.<ref name=Gray1 />   In the late afternoon and evening, the Sioux and Cheyenne ended their siege of Reno and Benteen and hastily broke camp and withdrew south, up the Little Bighorn Valley.<ref name=Gray1 />\n\n==== Medical Care Following the Battle, Disability ====\n\nThe next day, June 27, 1876, Half Yellow Face made a horse travois designed to carry the wounded White Swan in a sitting position, and used this to carry him about 12 miles from the battle site to the steamer ''Far West'' on the Bighorn River so White Swan could get more medical care.<ref name=Tomahawk /><ref name=HYF /><ref name=\"Gray Boyer\">{{cite book|last=Gray|first=John Shapley|title=Custer's Last Campaign: Mitch Boyer and the Little Horn Reconstructed|year=1991|publisher=Bison Books, University of Nebraska Press|isbn=0-8032-7040-2|page=380|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2wXFvLZrO78C&pg=PA381 }}</ref>   White Swan was carried on the ''Far West'' about 40 to 50 river miles down the Bighorn to the Yellowstone, where he was left in a temporary hospital facility with some of the less seriously wounded soldiers.<ref name=\"Gray Boyer\" />\n\nAlmost immediately after the battle, the three scouts [[White Man Runs Him]], [[Goes Ahead]] and [[Hairy Moccasin]] left for the main Crow encampment which was \"two sleeps\" away on the mouth of Pryor Creek, and Gibbon's other Crow scouts went with them.<ref name=\"Gray Boyer\" /> At the village they reported that both White Swan and Half Yellow Face had been killed.<ref name=\"Gray Boyer\" /><ref name=\"PrettyShield\">{{cite book|last1=Linderman|first1=Frank B.|title=Pretty Shield, Medicine Woman of the Crows|date=2003|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|location=Lincoln, Nebraska|isbn=0-8032-8025-4|pages=139, 139, 140|url=https://books.google.com/?id=E9os3ojgapcC&pg=PA139&lpg=PA139&dq=pretty+shield+white+swan#v=onepage&q=pretty%20shield%20white%20swan&f=false|accessdate=6 May 2016}}</ref>\n\nCurly and Half Yellow Face had not gone with the other scouts to the Crow Village, and they had returned with Gibbon to the mouth of the Big Horn where White Swan was in the temporary army hospital.<ref name=\"Gray Boyer\" /> On July 4, Col.

White Swan had lost the lower half of his right hand, and he had a right wrist that was permanently deformed to bend sharply inward. (See photo above taken from the right side, showing injured wrist). He also limped from the bullet wound in his leg and/or foot.<ref name=American-Tribes1 />  He was deaf and dumb, reportedly from the stroke to his forehead by a warclub in a battle with a Sioux warrior, probably at a time different than the Little Bighorn Battle.<ref name=Sharp/><ref name=American-Tribes1 />\n\nJ.H. Sharp, the noted western painter, came to know White Swan while he was living at Crow Agency, Montana and painting the Crow people.  Sharp painted White Swan.  He made this note to accompany the painting.\n\n<blockquote>Reno's scout in Custer battle, wounded many times, picked up in battlefield two days later -- deaf and dumb from stroke of war club in forehead.  A good artist in Indian picture-writing.  Jolly, good natured and a general favorite.  A full brother, and direct opposite in character of 'Curley', Custer's scout.\"<ref name=Sharp /></blockquote>\n\nAlthough White Swan was quite limited in speech, probably due to being deaf, White Swan could still communicate by using the sign language of the Plains Indians.<ref name=Thackery />\n\nStatements from White Swan's army pension file indicate that his wife had died in 1873, before he enlisted as an Army scout, and he never remarried.  The 1885 Census recorded him as living with a widowed aunt named \"Strikes By The Side Of The Water\".<ref name=American-Tribes1 /> This aunt was the mother of [[Curly (scout)|Curley]], another Crow Scout, which would make White Swan and Curley cousins,<ref name=American-Tribes1 /> though the artist, J.H. Sharp knew White Swan as the brother of Curley.<ref name=Sharp />\n\nIn 1894 White Swan was very limited being crippled and unable to hear or speak.<ref name=American-Tribes />  In 1897 he applied for and received a pension of $17.00 a month for his military services.<ref name=Tomahawk />  The 1900 census lists White Swan as \"widowed\" and the only member of his household.<ref name=American-Tribes1 />   White Swan's only other relative was Sage Woman, a half sister on his father's side, which meant she was from another Crow tribal clan than White Swan, since clan relations are passed down through mothers.<ref name=American-Tribes1 /> These facts indicate that White Swan lived in a more isolated fashion than he would have otherwise done, had he a larger base of Crow relatives, either by blood or by clan. White Swan died leaving no direct descendants<ref name=American-Tribes1 /> and there were no indication of adoptive children, further indicating a limited group of close Crow relatives, by blood or clan, unusual in the Crow culture.\n\n=== Artistic Ability -- Drawings and Weapons ===\n\nWhite Swan was known for his artistic abilities.  While living at the Crow Agency in the Little Bighorn valley, White Swan made drawings to illustrate key events in his life, including but not limited to his role in the Battle of the Little Bighorn.<ref name=Lindersmith /> At least fifteen drawings have been attributed to White Swan, and others remain to be discovered.<ref name=Lindersmith /> Though not signed his drawings can be identified by the many scenes they share, and by similarities in style with the few for which his authorship is definitely known.<ref name=Lindersmith />\n\nIn addition to his separate drawings, sources indicate that White Swan, though significantly disabled, created drawings and paintings on pages from accounting ledgers to depict his role in the famous battle.<ref name=American-Tribes /> White Swan also drew and painted on larger sheets of muslin canvas, showing multiple deeds from his life.<ref name=Thackery /><ref name=Lindersmith />\n\nOver the years since White Swan died, as his artistic abilities have been recognized and collected. White Swan emerges as a professional artist who created works of art for sale.  White Swan would have wanted income after he had ceased to be an army scout.  The Crow Agency where he lived was just a few miles from the site of the famous battle.  The Agency, as well as the battle field drew visitors.  White Swan found a ready market among military men, government employees and other visitors, who wanted to return home with something that genuinely represented their encounter with Indians of the West.<ref name=Lindersmith />  White Swan's art showing his war deeds ideally captured the essence of the Indian warrior tradition based on heroic acts.<ref name=Lindersmith />\n\nIn addition to his drawings White Swan's craftsmanship is shown in his personal items, and particularly his tomahawk, pictured (a) in the photo above (which may be enlarged) and (b) further shown and described at this footnoted web source.<ref name=Tomahawk /> A tomahawk in the Northern Plains warrior culture could evolve from being a weapon to an item carried primarily to count coup, which transformed the item into one possessing spiritual significance.  Adornments to White Swan's tomahawk (see item pictured in footnoted source, or in the photo above), probably indicated brave war deeds, and/or instructions of critical spiritual import, received through visions or through the intervention of a spiritual leader/mentor (a \"medicine man\").<ref name=Tomahawk />\n\nWhen living at Crow Agency on the Little Bighorn river, White Swan had a tepee which had drawings around the lower portion that depicted the Custer battle. A picture of the tepee is at the footnoted citation.<ref name=\"Sharp\" />\n\nIn his later life, White Swan was photographed by Frank Rinehart, and by William A. Petzolt.  See photos provided above. \n\nWhite Swan's tomahawk and his drawings remain today as a legacy of his time. White Swan's art is now drawing increasing attention from collectors, and they have been the subject of exhibits,<ref name=Bradley>{{cite book|last=Bradley|first=Douglas E.|title=White Swan, Crow Indian warrior and painter: October 13-December 13, 1991|year=1991|publisher=Snite Museum of Art, University of Notre Dame, 1991|location=Notre Dame, Ind.|url=https://books.google.com/?id=_yE8OAAACAAJ&dq=White+Swan,+Crow+Indian+warrior+and+painter:+October+13-December+13,+1991}}</ref> and the subject of University thesis.<ref name=Nelson>{{cite journal|last=Nelson|first=Rebecca|title=White Swan: a Crow Indian painter of the nineteenth century|year=1984}}</ref> and collections.<ref name=Lindersmith /> Some of White Swan's works were collected as part of the Paul Dyck collection of Plains Indians art and artifacts, and are now part of the collection at the Buffalo Bill Historical Center in Cody, Wyoming.<ref name=Thackery />\n\n=== Death and Burial ===\n[[File:Location of White Swan's (Crow Scout and Artist) grave stone at the Little Bighorn National Cemetery..jpg|thumb|right|This photo is looking due north from White Swans' (Crow scout and artist) grave marker (the gray marker in the immediate left foreground) to the central flagpole at the [[Little Bighorn Battlefield National Monument|National Cemetery at the Little Bighorn Battlefield]].

At the [[Battle of the Little Bighorn]] in the [[Crow Indian Reservation]],<ref>Kappler, Charles J.: Indian Affairs. Laws and Treaties. Washington, 1904. Vol. 2, p. 1008: Treaty with the Crows,1868.</ref> White Swan went with Major [[Marcus Reno|Reno]]'s detachment, and fought alongside the soldiers at the south end of the village. Of the six Crow scouts at the [[Battle of the Little Bighorn]], White Swan stands out because he aggressively sought combat with multiple Sioux and Cheyenne warriors, and he was the only Crow Scout to be wounded in action, suffering severe wounds to his hand/wrist and leg/foot. After being disabled by his wounds, he was taken to Reno's hill entrenchments by [[Half Yellow Face, Crow Indian|Half Yellow Face]], the pipe-bearer (leader) of the [[Crow Indian|Crow]] scouts, which no doubt saved his life.\n\nOn the 27th, after the battle, Half Yellow Face made a special horse [[travois]] for White Swan and moved him down the Little Horn valley to the ''Far West'' steamship, moored at the junction of the Bighorn River and the Little Horn, so he could get medical care from army physicians. White Swan was treated in a temporary Army hospital at the junction of the Bighorn and Yellowstone rivers. At the Crow encampments on Pryor Creek, other returning scouts reported that White Swan had died, but he survived his wounds.\n\nFollowing the Battle of the Little Bighorn, White Swan continued for five years (1876 to 1881) to serve as a scout with the U.S. Army, though he was significantly disabled. He had a severely deformed right wrist and hand, and he limped from the wound in his foot/leg from wounds received in the Battle of the Little Bighorn.  In photographs, White Swan also had a scar on his forehead where he had been struck with a war club in a separate battle with a Sioux warrior. Either from this blow or from other sources, White Swan could not hear and thus was unable to speak in his later life.  Eventually, he was awarded a small army [[pension]].\n\nIn White Swan's later life, he lived at the [[Crow Agency]], after it had been moved in 1884 to its present site in the [[Little Bighorn river|Little Bighorn]] valley in [[Montana]], close to the site of the battlefield. When he could no longer be an Army scout, White Swan began to produce drawings that represented key events in his life, including events of the Battle of the Little Bighorn. These drawings were bought by visitors to the Crow Agency and the nearby Custer Battlefield, providing White Swan with a welcome source of income. These drawings have now been discovered by collectors and their artistic value has been recognized. They have recently become the subject of collectors, exhibitions, books and university theses, and prints of his drawings are now commercially produced.\n\nWhile living at Crow Agency, White Swan was painted by the artist [[Joseph Henry Sharp|J.H. Sharp]], who knew him and described him as \"Jolly, good natured and a general favorite.\"<ref name=Sharp />  White Swan's wife had died when he was only 23 before he became an army scout, and he did not remarry.  He lived for a time with an aunt, \"Strikes By The Side Of The Water\" who was also the mother of [[Curly (scout)|Curly]], another Crow scout, and he and Curly were known in the Crow Agency community as brothers, though their personalities were said to be the opposite of each other.\n\nHe died in 1904, leaving no direct descendants. He is buried in the National Cemetery at the Little Bighorn Battlefield. Although his early death and his inability to hear and speak left him out of the limelight that later fell on the other surviving Crow scouts, his outstanding bravery during the battle and his artistic ability established an enduring legacy.

Cambridge, 1995, p. 106.</ref> From the point of the Crows in 1876 finally something was going to be done.\n\nHowever the [[Great Sioux War of 1876]] started because the U.S. Government also had its own larger [[agenda]]. [[Gold]] had been found in 1873 in the [[Black Hills]] on reservation lands granted the Sioux tribe by the [[Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868)]] and by 1875 a full scale gold rush was underway.  Ever increasing numbers of gold seekers were encroaching on Sioux lands in the Black Hills and established multiple mining centers and boom towns.  Being on the Sioux Reservation, these towns and mines were completely outside and apart from territorial governmental structure exercised by the U.S. in the rest of the west resulting in, among other things, random or non existent law and order activities due to the absence of federal law jurisdiction, and federal marshals, courts and judges.  Also critical was the impact of the the economic [[panic of 1873]] which had left workers unemployed and the dollar devalued, and the U.S. economy could be improved by bringing the increasing and significant output of gold from the Black Hills under the U.S. Government's immediate control and jurisdiction.  The U.S. Government had tried unsuccessfully in 1875 to bring the Sioux living on the reservations to a conference to consider modifying the [[Fort Laramie Treaty (1868)|1868 Fort Laramie Treaty]] by ceding the Black Hills back to the U.S.  However in Article XII of the that treaty any modification of treaty lands required the agreement of 3/4 of the tribe's adult males, and there were large bands of \"off reservation\" Sioux (including influential leaders like [[Sitting Bull]], [[Crazy Horse]], [[Touch the Clouds]], [[Spotted Elk]], [[Spotted Tail]], [[Gall]] and others) who did not reside on the reservations and who also did not want to cede the Black Hills back to federal control.  These bands lived year round in their traditional migratory way on a vast hunting preserves given them by Article XVI of the [[Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868)]] which included the lands extending from the Black Hills across the entire Powder River Basin to the crest of the Big Horn Mountains.  In November 1875, the U.S. Government sent out an impossible ultimatum to these bands -- to leave their winter camps in the hunting preserve and immediately, in the dead of winter, return to their agencies in the Dakota Territories. When this predictably did not occur, in early 1876 the Government directed army columns to converge from the south, east and west on these \"off reservation\" Sioux bands in their encampments in southern Montana Territory with orders to bring the \"off reservation\" Sioux back to their agencies, by force if necessary. \n\nOne such column commanded by Col. [[John Gibbon]] was instructed to proceed from Ft. Ellis, near present day Bozeman, Montana down the Yellowstone River and take up a position in southern Montana Territory to block the \"off reservation\" Sioux from crossing north of the Yellowstone River.  In furtherance of this mission, on April 9, 1876, Col. [[John Gibbon]] went with Lt. James Bradley to the Crow Indian Agency, which was then located on the Stillwater River Drainage in Montana, to recruit Indian scouts.<ref name=Gray1>{{cite book|last=Gray|first=John S.|title=Centennial Campaign, the Sioux War of 1876|year=1988|publisher=Oklahoma Press|isbn=9780806121529|pages=320\u2013340}}</ref> In an embarrassing two-hour council the chiefs of the Mountain Crows expressed their reluctance to help the expedition. They pointed out that Indian warriors traveled light and fast and struck quickly, but the soldiers marched slowly with wagons and thus never found the enemy.<ref name=Gray1 />\n\nFortunately for Gibbon the young Crow braves didn't follow the elder's advice, and sought adventure.  On April 10, 1876 some twenty five Crows were enlisted for six months in the 7th Infantry by Lt. James Bradley, chief of scouts,<ref name=Gray1 /> including White Swan and Half Yellow Face.<ref name=American-Tribes>{{cite web|title=White Swan -- Crow|url=http://american-tribes.com/wordpress/tag/white-swan|publisher=American-Tribes.com|accessdate=21 May 2013}}</ref>  On April 13, 1876, the Crow Scouts went with Gibbon's 7th Infantry force of 477 persons, as they marched down the Yellowstone to the mouth of the Bighorn River, arriving on April 20.  Gibbon then moved downstream along the Yellowstone from the Bighorn to [[Rosebud Creek]]<ref name=Gray1 />  The Crow Scouts skirmished with Sioux scouts as the Sioux village passed from [[Tongue River (Montana)|Tongue River]] to the Rosebud valley in May 1876.<ref name=Gray1 />  Gibbon's column rendezvoused at the mouth of Rosebud Creek on June 21, 1876 with General [[Alfred Terry]]'s column, which included the 7th Cavalry under General [[George A.

The 7th Cavalry, under the command of Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custer, were ordered by General Terry to follow the trail of a large encampment of \"off-reservation\" Sioux who lived nomadic lives off the [[Great Sioux Reservation]]<ref>Kappler, Charles J.: Indian Affairs. Laws and Treaties. Washington, 1904, Vol. 2, pp. 998-1003.</ref> in present South Dakota. This group was making an annual westward spring migration from their camp on the Powder River valley to the Tongue and then to the Rosebud Valley, and on to the Little Bighorn.<ref name=Gray1 />  Custer was ordered to locate the encampment of these \"off reservation\" Sioux on the Rosebud Creek, or in the adjacent Little Bighorn Valley, around 20 miles (30&nbsp;km) inside the eastern border of the Crow Indian reservation.<ref>Kappler, Charles J.: Indian Affairs.

This boundary area was a sort of no-mans land with both Sioux and Crows hunting on it, and warriors from both tribes crossing it to raid and steal horses from each other. \n\nThe six Crow scouts joined Custer on June 21. \"They are magnificent-looking men, so much handsomer and more Indian-like than any we have ever seen, and so jolly and sportive ... \" wrote Custer to his wife, [[Elizabeth Bacon Custer|Elizabeth B. Custer]].<ref name=\"Custer, Elizabeth B. 1968, p. 275\">Custer, Elizabeth B.: \"Boots and Saddles\" or, Life in Dakota with General Custer. Norman, 1968, p. 275.</ref> He also pointed out, why it was important to get them connected to the U.S. Army, \"I now have some Crow scouts with me, as they are familiar with the country.\"<ref name=\"Custer, Elizabeth B. 1968, p. 275\"/> Charles A.

Including his Testimony at the Reno Court of Inquiry. Lincoln,1987, p. 60.</ref>\n\nSince this was their ancestral homeland, the Crow scouts were relied on to undertake important scouting assignments for Custer in the days after June 21 leading up to the Battle of the Little Bighorn on June 25.\n\nWhen Custer struck the trail of the \"off reservation\" Sioux the scouts' count of 400 to 450 lodges in the encampment<ref name=Gray1 /><ref name=\"Philbrick\">{{cite book|last1=Philbrick|first1=Nathanial|title=The Last Stand|date=2010|publisher=Penguin Group|location=375 Hudson Street, New York, New York 10014|isbn=978-0-670-02172-7|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780670021727}}</ref> confirmed army sources indicting an \"off reservation\" nomadic group of about 800 warriors. This compared favorably to Custer's force of about 600 troopers.  However this initial assessment on June 21 was made on encampments dating back to May 21, when the Sioux/Cheyenne crossed from the Tongue River to the Rosebud Valley.<ref name=Gray1 />  As the scouts followed this trail up the Rosebud, past Lame Deer Creek and then on to the divide with the Little Horn Valley, they found the older trail increasingly joined and overlaid by many newer trails.  These newer trails were left by many other bands of Sioux/Cheyenne coming from the reservations to join the original \"off-reservation\" Sioux for their yearly summer gathering.<ref name=Gray1 /> Although not appreciated at the time, these late arriving bands of Sioux/Cheyenne swelled the encampment from 400 to about 960 lodges, able to field close to 2000 warriors.<ref name=Gray1 />\n\nCuster's prior experience in pursuing other Indian bands indicated that an Indian group would scatter if they knew they were being pursued.<ref name=Gray1 />  Custer used the Crows to check these trails to rule out a dispersal of the encampment he was following.  Custer tended to disregard the Crow scouts' intelligence that more and more Indians were gathering together.<ref name=Gray1 />\n\nOn the early morning of June 25, 1876, White Swan and other Crow Scouts ascended a high point on the divide between the Little Bighorn River and Rosebud Creek.<ref name=Tomahawk />  From this lookout point (which later became known as the \"Crow's Nest\") the scouts saw very large horse herds on the western margins of the Little Bighorn Valley, some 15 air miles away.  These large horse herds indicated an unexpectedly large Sioux/Cheyenne encampment. The encampment itself was out of sight on the valley floor.\n\nThe Crow scouts questioned the wisdom of attacking such a large encampment.  However, Custer was focused on his concern that his force had been detected that morning by Sioux scouts, and he feared that if he did not attack at once, the large encampment would break up into many smaller bands which would scatter in all directions, thus escaping and avoiding the decisive engagement the army hoped for. Custer therefore made plans for an immediate attack, and as he proceeded down Reno Creek toward the Little Bighorn Valley, he created four separate detachments, intended to prevent the encampment from scattering, and to strike the village from different directions. Reno with three troops would attack the south end of the village.  Custer with five troops would attack the north end of the village, and Benteen with 3 troops would scout briefly to the south, and then join the battle to assist the other detachments; Lt. McDougall's remaining troop would act as rear guard protecting the pack train.\n\n==== Wounded in action at the Battle of the Little Bighorn ====\nBefore the battle started, the scout White Swan watched the Lakota camp through a handheld telescope with his [[Horses in warfare|warhorse]] standing close by - this exact moment would later be a favorite scene of the artist White Swan to illustrate.<ref>Cowles, David C.: White Swan. Crow Artist at the Little Big Horn. ''American Indian Art Magazine'', Vol. 7, No. 4 (1982), pp. 52-61, p. 55.</ref>\n\nAs the Battle of the Little Bighorn unfolded White Swan and the chief Crow Scout Half Yellow Face, along with Arikara scouts accompanied the detachment under Major Reno.<ref name=Tomahawk />  The Indian scouts were told to stampede the horse herd on the western margins of the camp.  Reno's detachment charged the south end of the village as ordered, but as warriors poured out to defend the village Reno ordered the troops to dismount and form a skirmish line.  This outpouring of Sioux warriors frustrated the plan of the scouts to stampede the horse herd, and the scouts, including White Swan and Half Yellow Face began to fight alongside the cavalrymen. They were soon engaged in furious combat with swiftly increasing numbers of Sioux and Cheyenne warriors.<ref name=Thackery />  At one time, White Swan was faced by six warriors.\n\nAs more warriors swarmed out of the village, Reno's detachment pulled back into a patch of nearby timber along the river. After taking more losses in the timber, Reno ordered a retreat out of the timber and across the river and up onto the bluffs on the east side of the valley.  By the time Reno had ordered the retreat across the river White Swan had suffered severe bullet wounds in the right hand/wrist and in his foot, knee or leg (reports differ),<ref name=Thackery /><ref name=HYF>{{cite web|title=Half Yellow Face, Crow|url=http://www.american-tribes.com/Crow/bio/HalfYellowFace.htm|publisher=American-Tribes.com|accessdate=24 May 2013}}</ref> and he also couldn't hear, either from being hit on the head with a war club or because a rifle was fired to close to his ear (reports differ).<ref name=Sharp>{{cite book|last=Riebeth|first=Carolyn Reynolds|title=J.

Back in the timber, Half Yellow Face got the wounded White Swan on a horse and shielded by the timber, waited until the mass of Sioux warriors had turned their attention to Custer's column, now approaching the north end of the village, after which Yellow Face led the horse across the river and up the bluffs to the location where the Reno detachment was digging in,<ref name=HYF /> and where they were later reinforced by the other detachments under Captain Benteen and Lieutenant McDougall. This action by Half Yellow Face probably saved White Swan's life.  Troopers with Reno later recounted how White Swan, though wounded wanted to continue fighting, and disabled as he was tried to crawl back to the firing lines.<ref name=Thackery />\n\nAfter Reno's men fled across the river the now thoroughly aroused and mobilized Sioux/Cheyenne drew back, and then launched a fresh attack to the north on Custer's separate detachment of five companies (about 210 men) who were now firing into north end of the village.  At this point the Sioux outnumbered Custer's men by about 8 to 1. Custer's detachment was first driven back to a low ridge east of the valley, and then overwhelmed and wiped out to the last man.  This intense engagement lasted about an hour during the afternoon of June 25, 1876, after which the warriors returned to press the attack on Reno's entrenched position on the bluffs.  The next day, June 26, the Sioux continued the attack on the beleaguered Reno contingent, where White Swan lay in the section for the wounded.  However Sioux scouts reported the approach from the north of the large army column under Generals Terry and Gibbon.<ref name=Gray1 />   In the late afternoon and evening, the Sioux and Cheyenne ended their siege of Reno and Benteen and hastily broke camp and withdrew south, up the Little Bighorn Valley.<ref name=Gray1 />\n\n==== Medical Care Following the Battle, Disability ====\n\nThe next day, June 27, 1876, Half Yellow Face made a horse travois designed to carry the wounded White Swan in a sitting position, and used this to carry him about 12 miles from the battle site to the steamer ''Far West'' on the Bighorn River so White Swan could get more medical care.<ref name=Tomahawk /><ref name=HYF /><ref name=\"Gray Boyer\">{{cite book|last=Gray|first=John Shapley|title=Custer's Last Campaign: Mitch Boyer and the Little Horn Reconstructed|year=1991|publisher=Bison Books, University of Nebraska Press|isbn=0-8032-7040-2|page=380|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2wXFvLZrO78C&pg=PA381 }}</ref>   White Swan was carried on the ''Far West'' about 40 to 50 river miles down the Bighorn to the Yellowstone, where he was left in a temporary hospital facility with some of the less seriously wounded soldiers.<ref name=\"Gray Boyer\" />\n\nAlmost immediately after the battle, the three scouts [[White Man Runs Him]], [[Goes Ahead]] and [[Hairy Moccasin]] left for the main Crow encampment which was \"two sleeps\" away on the mouth of Pryor Creek, and Gibbon's other Crow scouts went with them.<ref name=\"Gray Boyer\" /> At the village they reported that both White Swan and Half Yellow Face had been killed.<ref name=\"Gray Boyer\" /><ref name=\"PrettyShield\">{{cite book|last1=Linderman|first1=Frank B.|title=Pretty Shield, Medicine Woman of the Crows|date=2003|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|location=Lincoln, Nebraska|isbn=0-8032-8025-4|pages=139, 139, 140|url=https://books.google.com/?id=E9os3ojgapcC&pg=PA139&lpg=PA139&dq=pretty+shield+white+swan#v=onepage&q=pretty%20shield%20white%20swan&f=false|accessdate=6 May 2016}}</ref>\n\nCurly and Half Yellow Face had not gone with the other scouts to the Crow Village, and they had returned with Gibbon to the mouth of the Big Horn where White Swan was in the temporary army hospital.<ref name=\"Gray Boyer\" /> On July 4, Col.

He continued a recovery from his wounds,<ref name=American-Tribes1 /> but he suffered disabilities from them for rest of his life.\n\n=== Later life, after the Battle of the Little Bighorn ===\n\nAlthough disabled, White Swan managed to remain an Army scout for much of the remaining five years (1876-1881) following the Battle of the Little Bighorn.<ref name=Lindersmith>{{cite web|title=The Lindersmith Collection|url=http://sniteartmuseum.nd.edu/assets/85955/|publisher=University of Notre Dame|accessdate=7 June 2013}}</ref>  When the Crow Reservation was further limited in size, the Agency was moved in 1884 from the site of present-day Absorakee, Montana on the Stillwater River to its present location at present-day [[Crow Agency, Montana|Crow Agency]] in the Little Bighorn Valley, very close to the site of the battle.<ref name=roots>{{cite web|title=Bighorn County, Trails to the Past|url=http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~mtbightp/Crow_Agency/crow_agency.html|work=History of Crow Agency|publisher=Rootsweb, Ancestry.com|accessdate=7 June 2013}}</ref>  White Swan also moved to the new agency site.\n\nWhite Swan continued to be limited by his battle wounds.  White Swan had lost the lower half of his right hand, and he had a right wrist that was permanently deformed to bend sharply inward. (See photo above taken from the right side, showing injured wrist). He also limped from the bullet wound in his leg and/or foot.<ref name=American-Tribes1 />  He was deaf and dumb, reportedly from the stroke to his forehead by a warclub in a battle with a Sioux warrior, probably at a time different than the Little Bighorn Battle.<ref name=Sharp/><ref name=American-Tribes1 />\n\nJ.H. Sharp, the noted western painter, came to know White Swan while he was living at Crow Agency, Montana and painting the Crow people.  Sharp painted White Swan.  He made this note to accompany the painting.\n\n<blockquote>Reno's scout in Custer battle, wounded many times, picked up in battlefield two days later -- deaf and dumb from stroke of war club in forehead.  A good artist in Indian picture-writing.  Jolly, good natured and a general favorite.  A full brother, and direct opposite in character of 'Curley', Custer's scout.\"<ref name=Sharp /></blockquote>\n\nAlthough White Swan was quite limited in speech, probably due to being deaf, White Swan could still communicate by using the sign language of the Plains Indians.<ref name=Thackery />\n\nStatements from White Swan's army pension file indicate that his wife had died in 1873, before he enlisted as an Army scout, and he never remarried.  The 1885 Census recorded him as living with a widowed aunt named \"Strikes By The Side Of The Water\".<ref name=American-Tribes1 /> This aunt was the mother of [[Curly (scout)|Curley]], another Crow Scout, which would make White Swan and Curley cousins,<ref name=American-Tribes1 /> though the artist, J.H. Sharp knew White Swan as the brother of Curley.<ref name=Sharp />\n\nIn 1894 White Swan was very limited being crippled and unable to hear or speak.<ref name=American-Tribes />  In 1897 he applied for and received a pension of $17.00 a month for his military services.<ref name=Tomahawk />  The 1900 census lists White Swan as \"widowed\" and the only member of his household.<ref name=American-Tribes1 />   White Swan's only other relative was Sage Woman, a half sister on his father's side, which meant she was from another Crow tribal clan than White Swan, since clan relations are passed down through mothers.<ref name=American-Tribes1 /> These facts indicate that White Swan lived in a more isolated fashion than he would have otherwise done, had he a larger base of Crow relatives, either by blood or by clan. White Swan died leaving no direct descendants<ref name=American-Tribes1 /> and there were no indication of adoptive children, further indicating a limited group of close Crow relatives, by blood or clan, unusual in the Crow culture.\n\n=== Artistic Ability -- Drawings and Weapons ===\n\nWhite Swan was known for his artistic abilities.  While living at the Crow Agency in the Little Bighorn valley, White Swan made drawings to illustrate key events in his life, including but not limited to his role in the Battle of the Little Bighorn.<ref name=Lindersmith /> At least fifteen drawings have been attributed to White Swan, and others remain to be discovered.<ref name=Lindersmith /> Though not signed his drawings can be identified by the many scenes they share, and by similarities in style with the few for which his authorship is definitely known.<ref name=Lindersmith />\n\nIn addition to his separate drawings, sources indicate that White Swan, though significantly disabled, created drawings and paintings on pages from accounting ledgers to depict his role in the famous battle.<ref name=American-Tribes /> White Swan also drew and painted on larger sheets of muslin canvas, showing multiple deeds from his life.<ref name=Thackery /><ref name=Lindersmith />\n\nOver the years since White Swan died, as his artistic abilities have been recognized and collected. White Swan emerges as a professional artist who created works of art for sale.  White Swan would have wanted income after he had ceased to be an army scout.  The Crow Agency where he lived was just a few miles from the site of the famous battle.  The Agency, as well as the battle field drew visitors.  White Swan found a ready market among military men, government employees and other visitors, who wanted to return home with something that genuinely represented their encounter with Indians of the West.<ref name=Lindersmith />  White Swan's art showing his war deeds ideally captured the essence of the Indian warrior tradition based on heroic acts.<ref name=Lindersmith />\n\nIn addition to his drawings White Swan's craftsmanship is shown in his personal items, and particularly his tomahawk, pictured (a) in the photo above (which may be enlarged) and (b) further shown and described at this footnoted web source.<ref name=Tomahawk /> A tomahawk in the Northern Plains warrior culture could evolve from being a weapon to an item carried primarily to count coup, which transformed the item into one possessing spiritual significance.  Adornments to White Swan's tomahawk (see item pictured in footnoted source, or in the photo above), probably indicated brave war deeds, and/or instructions of critical spiritual import, received through visions or through the intervention of a spiritual leader/mentor (a \"medicine man\").<ref name=Tomahawk />\n\nWhen living at Crow Agency on the Little Bighorn river, White Swan had a tepee which had drawings around the lower portion that depicted the Custer battle. A picture of the tepee is at the footnoted citation.<ref name=\"Sharp\" />\n\nIn his later life, White Swan was photographed by Frank Rinehart, and by William A. Petzolt.  See photos provided above. \n\nWhite Swan's tomahawk and his drawings remain today as a legacy of his time.

Firstly, there must be sufficient quantity of virus available to initiate infection. Cells at the site of infection must be accessible, in that they possess host factors that the virus can exploit for entry into the cell, and the host anti-viral defense systems must be ineffective or absent.<ref name=\"refMM\"/><ref name =\"raca\"/>\n\n===Implantation at point of entry===\nThe virus must implant at the entry portal of the body. Implantation is the earliest stage of pathogenesis. Implantation frequency is at its greatest where viruses directly contact living cells. Viruses usually implant on cells of respiratory, gastrointestinal, skin and genital tissues.<ref name=\"baron\"/><ref name=\"mpdd\"/><ref name=\"sherris2014\" /> Some viruses are capable of implanting in a fetus through infected germ cells at the time of [[fertilization]]. Implantation can also occur later in the pregnancy via the placenta, and also at birth.<ref name=\"baron\"/>\n\n===Local replication and spread=== \nFollowing implantation, the virus hijacks the host cell machinery to undergo viral amplification. Here, the virus must modulate the host innate immune response to prevent its elimination by the body while facilitating its replication. Replicated virus from the initially infected cell then disperse to infect neighbouring susceptible cells, possibly with spread to different cell types like leukocytes. This results in a [[localized disease|localised infection]], in which the virus mainly spreads and infects adjacent cells to the site of entry.<ref name=\"refMM\"/><ref name=\"mpdd\">{{cite book |title=Molecular Pathology and the Dynamics of Disease |last=Mitchell |first=Maika G.  |url=https://doi.org/10.1016/C2016-0-04893-3 |publisher=[[Academic Press]] |isbn=978-0-12-814610-1|date=2010-04-16 }}</ref>  Otherwise, the virus can be released into extracellular fluids.\nExamples of localised infections include: common cold ([[rhinovirus]]), flu ([[Human parainfluenza viruses|parainfluenza]]), gastrointestinal infections ([[rotavirus]]) or skin infections ([[Human papillomavirus infection|papillomavirus]]) are examples of localised infections.<ref name=\"baron\"/>\n\n===Dissemination and secondary replication=== \nIn other cases, the virus can cause [[systemic disease]] through a disseminated infection spread throughout the body. The predominant mode of viral dissemination occurs through the blood or [[lymphatic system]], some of which include viruses responsible for chickenpox ([[varicella zoster virus]]), smallpox ([[smallpox|variola]]), HIV ([[HIV|human immunodeficiency virus]]). A minority of viruses can disseminate via the nervous system.<ref name=\"baron\"/><ref name=\"mpdd\"/> Notably, the [[poliovirus]] can be transmitted via the fecal-oral route, where it initially replicates in its site of entry, the small intestine and spread to regional [[lymph node]]s. Then, the virus disseminates via the bloodstream into different organs in the body (e.g. liver, spleen), followed by a secondary round of replication and dissemination into the central nervous system to damage [[motor neuron]]s.<ref name=\"sherris2014\" /> \n\n===Shedding and secondary transmission=== \nFinally, the viruses spread to sites where [[Viral shedding|shedding]] into the environment can occur. The [[respiratory]], [[alimentary]] and [[urogenital]] tracts and the blood are the most frequent sites of shedding in the form of bodily fluids, aerosols, skin, excrement. The virus would then go on to be transmitted to another person, and establish the infection cycle all over again.<ref name=\"baron\"/><ref name=\"mpdd\"/><ref name=\"sherris2014\" />\n\n==Factors affecting pathogenesis== \nThere are a few main overarching factors affecting viral diseases:\n*Virus tropism\n*Virus factors\n*Host factors\n\n===Molecular basis of virus tropism===\n'''Virus tropism''' refers to the virus\u2019 preferential site of replication in discrete cell types within an organ. In most cases, tropism is determined by the ability of the [[viral protein|viral surface proteins]] to fuse or bind to surface receptors of specific target cells to establish infection.  Thus, the binding specificity of viral surface proteins dictates tropism as well as the destruction of particular cell populations, and is therefore a major determinant of virus pathogenesis.<ref name=\"baron\"/><ref name=\"mpdd\"/>\nHowever, [[co-receptor]]s are sometimes required in addition to the binding of cellular receptors on host cells to viral proteins in order to establish infection. For instance, HIV-1 requires target cells to express co-receptors [[CCR5]] or [[CXCR4]], on top of the [[CD4]] receptor for productive viral attachment.<ref>  {{Cite journal | author=Shen, H., Yin, J., Leng, F. | title=HIV coreceptor tropism determination and mutational pattern identification | journal=[[Scientific Reports]] | volume=6 | year=2016 | url=https://doi.org/10.1038/srep21280 }}  </ref> Interestingly, HIV-1 can undergo a [[HIV tropism|tropism switch]], where the virus [[Envelope glycoprotein GP120|glycoprotein gp120]] initially uses CCR5 (mainly on macrophages) as the primary co-receptor for entering the host cell. Subsequently, HIV-1 switches to bind to CXCR4 (mainly on [[T cell]]s) as the infection progresses, in doing so transitions the viral pathogenicity to a different stage.<ref name =\"robbins\" />\n \nApart from cellular receptors, viral tropism can also governed by other intracellular factors, such as tissue-specific [[transcription factors]]. An example would be the [[JC polyomavirus]], in which its tropism is limited to [[glial cells]] since its [[enhancer]] is only active in glial cells,<ref name=\"baron\"/> and JC viral gene expression requires host transcription factors expressed exclusively in glial cells.<ref name =\"robbins\"> {{cite book |title =Robbins & Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease |edition=9 |editor1=Kumar, Vinay |editor2=Abbas, Abul K. |editor3=Aster, Jon C. |publisher=[[Elsevier]] |isbn=9780323313094|date =2014 }} </ref>\n\nThe accessibility of host tissues and organs to the virus also regulates tropism. Accessibility is affected by physical barriers<ref name=\"baron\"/><ref name=\"mpdd\"/>, such as in enteroviruses, which replicate in the intestine since they are able to withstand bile, digestive enzymes and acidic environments.<ref name =\"robbins\" />\n\n===Virus factors===\nViral genetics encoding viral factors will determine the degree of viral pathogenesis. This can be measured as [[virulence]] , which can be used to compare the quantitative degree of pathology between related viruses. In other words, different virus strains possessing different virus factors can lead to different degrees of virulence, which in turn can be exploited to study the differences in pathogenesis of viral variants with different virulence.<ref name=\"principlesvirology\"/><ref name=gonzalez> {{Cite journal | author=Fuentes-Gonz\u00e1lez AM, Contreras-Paredes A, Manzo-Merino J, Lizano M | title=The modulation of apoptosis by oncogenic viruses | journal=[[Virology Journal]] | volume=10 | year=2013 | doi=10.1186/1743-422X-10-182 | doi-access=free }}  </ref>\n\nVirus factors are largely influenced by viral genetics, which is the virulence determinant of structural or non-structural proteins and [[non-coding DNA|non-coding sequences]]. For a virus to successfully infect and cause disease in the host, it has to encode specific virus factors in its genome to overcome the preventive effects of physical barriers, and modulate host inhibition of virus replication.<ref name=\"baron\"/> In the case of poliovirus, all vaccine strains found in the oral [[polio vaccine]] contain [[attenuated vaccine|attenuating]] point mutations in the [[five prime untranslated region| 5' untranslated region]] (5' UTR). Conversely, the virulent strain responsible for causing smallpox does not contain these 5\u2019 UTR point mutations and thus display greater viral pathogenicity in hosts.<ref name=\"Nathanson\" />\n\nVirus factors encoded in the genome often control the tropism, routes of virus entry, shedding and transmission. In polioviruses, the attenuating point mutations are thought to induce a replication and [[translation]] defect to reduce the virus\u2019 ability of cross-linking to host cells and replicate within the nervous system.<ref> {{Cite journal | author=Guti\u00e9rrez AL | title=Attenuating Mutations in the Poliovirus 5\" Untranslated Region Alter Its Interaction with Polypyrimidine Tract-Binding Protein | journal=[[Journal of Virology]] | volume=71 | year=1997 | pages=3826\u20133833 | url=https://jvi.asm.org/content/jvi/71/5/3826.full.pdf }}  </ref>\n\nViruses have also developed a variety of [[immunomodulation]] mechanisms to subvert the host immune response. This tend to feature virus-encoded decoy receptors that target [[cytokine]]s and [[chemokine]]s produced as part of the host immune response, or homologues of host cytokines.<ref>  {{Cite journal | author=Felix, J., Savvides, S. | title=Mechanisms of immunomodulation by mammalian and viral decoy receptors: insights from structures | journal=[[Nature Reviews Immunology]] | volume=17 | year=2017 | pages=112-129 | url=https://doi.org/10.1038/nri.2016.134 }}  </ref> As such, viruses capable of manipulating the host cell response to infection as an immune evasion strategy exhibit greater pathogenicity.\n\n===Host factors=== \nViral pathogenesis is also largely dependent on host factors. Several viral infections have displayed a variety of effects, ranging from [[asymptomatic]] to symptomatic or even critical infection, solely based of differing host factors alone.

In latent infections, reactivation of disease may occur a long time after the initial infection.]]\n\nImportantly, viral infections can differ by the \u201clifestyle strategy\u201d \u2013 infections can be generally categorised as acute or persistent. '''Acute infections''' occur when viral replication produces factors that interfere with host cellular processes resulting in cell death. '''Persistent infections''' happen when cells continue to survive despite a viral infection and can be further classified into '''latent''' (only the viral [[genome]] is present, there is no replication occurring) and '''chronic''' (basal levels of viral replication without stimulating an immune response). In acute infections, [[lytic cycle|lytic viruses]] are shed at high titres for rapid infection to a secondary tissue/host, whereas persistent viruses undergo shedding at lower titres for a longer duration of transmission (months to years).<ref name=\"Nathanson\" />\n\nLytic viruses are capable of destroying host cells by incurring and/or interfering with the specialised functions of host cells. An example would be the triggering of [[necrosis]] in host cells infected with the virus. Otherwise, signatures of viral infection, like the binding of HIV to co-receptors CCR5 or CXCR4, can also trigger cell death via [[apoptosis]] through host signalling cascades by immune cells. However, many viruses encode proteins that can modulate apoptosis depending on whether the infection is acute or persistent. Induction of apoptosis, such as through interaction with [[caspase]]s, will promote viral shedding for lytic viruses to facilitate transmission, while viral inhibition of apoptosis could prolong the production of virus in cells, or allow the virus to remain hidden from the immune system in chronic, persistent infections.<ref name =\"robbins\" /><ref name=gonzalez/> Nevertheless, induction of apoptosis in major immune cells or [[antigen-presenting cell]]s may also act as a mechanism of [[immunosuppression]] in persistent infections like HIV. The primary cause of immunosuppression in HIV patients is due to the depletion of [[T helper cell|CD4+ T helper cells]].<ref name=\"sherris2014\" />\n\nInterestingly, [[adenovirus]] has an '''[[Adenovirus early region 1A|E1A]]''' protein to induce apoptosis by initiating the cell cycle, and an '''[[Adenovirus E1B protein|E1B]]''' protein to block the apoptotic pathway through inhibition of caspase interaction.<ref> {{Cite journal | author=Eileen White | title=Regulation of Apoptosis by Adenovirus E1A and E1B Oncogenes | journal=Seminars in Virology | volume=8 | year=1998 | pages=505-513 | url=https://doi.org/10.1006/smvy.1998.0155 }}  </ref>\n\nPersistent viruses can sometimes [[Carcinogenesis|transform host cells into cancer cells]].

The stimulation of the [[Innate immune system|innate]] and [[adaptive immune system|adaptive]] immune system in response to viral infections destroys infected cells, which may lead to severe pathological consequences to the host. This damage caused by the immune system is known as virus-induced [[immunopathology]]. \n\nSpecifically, immunopathology is caused by the excessive release of [[antibody|antibodies]], [[interferon]]s and pro-inflammatory [[cytokines]], activation of the [[complement system]], or hyperactivity of [[cytotoxic T cell]]s. Secretion of interferons and other cytokines can trigger cell damage, fever and flu-like symptoms. In severe cases of certain viral infections, as in the [[Global spread of H5N1 in 2005|avian H5N1 influenza pandemic in 2005]], aberrant induction of the host immune response can elicit a [[cytokine storm]].<ref> {{Cite journal | author=Tisoncik JR, Korth MJ, Simmons CP, Farrar J, Martin TR, Katze MG | title=Into the Eye of the Cytokine Storm | journal=[[Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews]] | volume=76 | year=2012 | pages=3826\u20133833 | doi=10.1128/MMBR.05015-11 | doi-access=free }}  </ref>\n\nIn some instances, viral infection can initiate an [[autoimmunity|autoimmune response]], which occurs via two proposed mechanisms: '''molecular mimicry''' and '''bystander mechanism'''.

The bystander mechanism hypothesizes the initiation of a non-specific and overreactive antiviral response that tackles self-antigens in the process.

The incubation period refers to the time taken for the onset of disease after first contact with the virus. The incubation period typically varies with the distance traversed by the virus to the target organ. Viruses that travel a short distance to reach their target organ have a short incubation period of one to three days. On the other hand, with generalized infections, the incubation period is longer, ranging from months to years, because of how long it takes the virus to move throughout the body and reach the target organs. Surprisingly, generalised infections by [[togaviruses]] have a short incubation period due to the direct entry of the virus into target cells through insect bites.<ref name=\"mpdd\"/>\n\nThere are several other factors that affect the incubation period. The mechanisms behind long incubation periods, months or years for example, are not completely understood yet.\n\n==Evolution of virulence==\nAs with all parasites, [[natural selection]] favours the survival of low-virulence virus strains.<ref name=\"baron\"/> Many relatively avirulent viruses in their natural host show increased virulence upon transfer to a new host species. When an [[emergent virus|emerging virus]] first invades a new host species, the hosts have little or no immunity against the virus and often suffer high [[Mortality rate|mortality]].  Hosts that survive do so because they possess a set of advantageous genes that are favourable to the [[selection pressure]], that prevents the host from dying due to infection of the novel pathogen.  These survivors then reproduce and pass on the favourable genes to their offspring while hosts that do not possess those genes are slowly eradicated by [[natural selection]], resulting in lower mortality rates in future generations. \n\nOver time, a decrease in virulence in the predominant strain is usually observed. This is because there is usually little advantage for a pathogen to kill the host before dispersal to new hosts, so viruses may evolve naturally to become less virulent to prolong survival in infected hosts to boost transmission. Likewise, the host will evolve to develop genetic resistance against the virus over time.<ref name=\"baron\"/>\n\nA paradigm of the evolution of virulence in emerging virus is the case of [[myxomatosis]] in rabbits. The release of wild European rabbits in 1859 into Victoria, Australia for sport resulted in a rabbit plague. In order to curb with rabbit overpopulation, [[myxoma virus]], a lethal species-specific poxvirus responsible for myxomatosis in rabbits, was deliberately released in South Australia in 1950. This led to a 90% decrease in rabbit populations, and the disease became [[endemic]] in a span of five years. Significantly, severely attenuated strains of the myxoma virus were detected in merely 2 years of its release, and genetic resistance in rabbits emerged within seven years.<ref name=\"Kerr2012\">  {{Cite journal | author=Peter J Kerr | title=Myxomatosis in Australia and Europe: A model for emerging infectious diseases | journal=[[Antiviral Research]] | volume=93 | year=2012 | pages=387-415 | url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2012.01.009 }}  </ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Pathogen]]\n*[[Pathogenesis]]\n*[[List of human diseases associated with infectious pathogens]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Virology]]\n", "text_old": "'''Viral pathogenesis''' is the study of how [[virus]]es cause diseases in their target [[Host (biology)|host]]s, usually carried out at the cellular or molecular level.

This results in a [[localized disease|localised infection]], in which the virus mainly spreads and infects adjacent cells to the site of entry.<ref name=\"refMM\"/><ref name=\"mpdd\">{{cite book |title=Molecular Pathology and the Dynamics of Disease |last=Mitchell |first=Maika G.  |url=https://doi.org/10.1016/C2016-0-04893-3 |publisher=[[Academic Press]] |isbn=978-0-12-814610-1|date=2010-04-16 }}</ref>  Otherwise, the virus can be released into extracellular fluids.\nExamples of localised infections include: common cold ([[rhinovirus]]), flu ([[Human parainfluenza viruses|parainfluenza]]), gastrointestinal infections ([[rotavirus]]) or skin infections ([[Human papillomavirus infection|papillomavirus]]) are examples of localised infections.<ref name=\"baron\"/>\n\n===Dissemination and secondary replication=== \nIn other cases, the virus can cause [[systemic disease]] through a disseminated infection spread throughout the body. The predominant mode of viral dissemination occurs through the blood or [[lymphatic system]], some of which include viruses responsible for chickenpox ([[varicella zoster virus]]), smallpox ([[smallpox|variola]]), HIV ([[HIV|human immunodeficiency virus]]). A minority of viruses can disseminate via the nervous system.<ref name=\"baron\"/><ref name=\"mpdd\"/> Notably, the [[poliovirus]] can be transmitted via the fecal-oral route, where it initially replicates in its site of entry, the small intestine and spread to regional [[lymph node]]s. Then, the virus disseminates via the bloodstream into different organs in the body (e.g. liver, spleen), followed by a secondary round of replication and dissemination into the central nervous system to damage [[motor neuron]]s.<ref name=\"sherris2014\" /> \n\n===Shedding and secondary transmission=== \nFinally, the viruses spread to sites where [[Viral shedding|shedding]] into the environment can occur. The [[respiratory]], [[alimentary]] and [[urogenital]] tracts and the blood are the most frequent sites of shedding in the form of bodily fluids, aerosols, skin, excrement. The virus would then go on to be transmitted to another person, and establish the infection cycle all over again.<ref name=\"baron\"/><ref name=\"mpdd\"/><ref name=\"sherris2014\" />\n\n==Factors affecting pathogenesis== \nThere are a few main overarching factors affecting viral diseases:\n*Virus tropism\n*Virus factors\n*Host factors\n\n===Molecular basis of virus tropism===\n'''Virus tropism''' refers to the virus\u2019 preferential site of replication in discrete cell types within an organ. In most cases, tropism is determined by the ability of the [[viral protein|viral surface proteins]] to fuse or bind to surface receptors of specific target cells to establish infection.  Thus, the binding specificity of viral surface proteins dictates tropism as well as the destruction of particular cell populations, and is therefore a major determinant of virus pathogenesis.<ref name=\"baron\"/><ref name=\"mpdd\"/>\nHowever, [[co-receptor]]s are sometimes required in addition to the binding of cellular receptors on host cells to viral proteins in order to establish infection. For instance, HIV-1 requires target cells to express co-receptors [[CCR5]] or [[CXCR4]], on top of the [[CD4]] receptor for productive viral attachment.<ref>  {{Cite journal | author=Shen, H., Yin, J., Leng, F. | title=HIV coreceptor tropism determination and mutational pattern identification | journal=[[Scientific Reports]] | volume=6 | year=2016 | url=https://doi.org/10.1038/srep21280 }}  </ref> Interestingly, HIV-1 can undergo a [[HIV tropism|tropism switch]], where the virus [[Envelope glycoprotein GP120|glycoprotein gp120]] initially uses CCR5 (mainly on macrophages) as the primary co-receptor for entering the host cell. Subsequently, HIV-1 switches to bind to CXCR4 (mainly on [[T cell]]s) as the infection progresses, in doing so transitions the viral pathogenicity to a different stage.<ref name =\"robbins\" />\n \nApart from cellular receptors, viral tropism can also governed by other intracellular factors, such as tissue-specific [[transcription factors]]. An example would be the [[JC polyomavirus]], in which its tropism is limited to [[glial cells]] since its [[enhancer]] is only active in glial cells,<ref name=\"baron\"/> and JC viral gene expression requires host transcription factors expressed exclusively in glial cells.<ref name =\"robbins\"> {{cite book |title =Robbins & Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease |edition=9 |editor1=Kumar, Vinay |editor2=Abbas, Abul K. |editor3=Aster, Jon C. |publisher=[[Elsevier]] |isbn=9780323313094|date =2014 }} </ref>\n\nThe accessibility of host tissues and organs to the virus also regulates tropism. Accessibility is affected by physical barriers<ref name=\"baron\"/><ref name=\"mpdd\"/>, such as in enteroviruses, which replicate in the intestine since they are able to withstand bile, digestive enzymes and acidic environments.<ref name =\"robbins\" />\n\n===Virus factors===\nViral genetics encoding viral factors will determine the degree of viral pathogenesis. This can be measured as [[virulence]] , which can be used to compare the quantitative degree of pathology between related viruses. In other words, different virus strains possessing different virus factors can lead to different degrees of virulence, which in turn can be exploited to study the differences in pathogenesis of viral variants with different virulence.<ref name=\"principlesvirology\"/><ref name=gonzalez> {{Cite journal | author=Fuentes-Gonz\u00e1lez AM, Contreras-Paredes A, Manzo-Merino J, Lizano M | title=The modulation of apoptosis by oncogenic viruses | journal=[[Virology Journal]] | volume=10 | year=2013 | doi=10.1186/1743-422X-10-182 | doi-access=free }}  </ref>\n\nVirus factors are largely influenced by viral genetics, which is the virulence determinant of structural or non-structural proteins and [[non-coding DNA|non-coding sequences]]. For a virus to successfully infect and cause disease in the host, it has to encode specific virus factors in its genome to overcome the preventive effects of physical barriers, and modulate host inhibition of virus replication.<ref name=\"baron\"/> In the case of poliovirus, all vaccine strains found in the oral [[polio vaccine]] contain [[attenuated vaccine|attenuating]] point mutations in the [[five prime untranslated region| 5' untranslated region]] (5' UTR). Conversely, the virulent strain responsible for causing smallpox does not contain these 5\u2019 UTR point mutations and thus display greater viral pathogenicity in hosts.<ref name=\"Nathanson\" />\n\nVirus factors encoded in the genome often control the tropism, routes of virus entry, shedding and transmission. In polioviruses, the attenuating point mutations are thought to induce a replication and [[translation]] defect to reduce the virus\u2019 ability of cross-linking to host cells and replicate within the nervous system.<ref> {{Cite journal | author=Guti\u00e9rrez AL | title=Attenuating Mutations in the Poliovirus 5\" Untranslated Region Alter Its Interaction with Polypyrimidine Tract-Binding Protein | journal=[[Journal of Virology]] | volume=71 | year=1997 | pages=3826\u20133833 | url=https://jvi.asm.org/content/jvi/71/5/3826.full.pdf }}  </ref>\n\nViruses have also developed a variety of [[immunomodulation]] mechanisms to subvert the host immune response. This tend to feature virus-encoded decoy receptors that target [[cytokine]]s and [[chemokine]]s produced as part of the host immune response, or homologues of host cytokines.<ref>  {{Cite journal | author=Felix, J., Savvides, S. | title=Mechanisms of immunomodulation by mammalian and viral decoy receptors: insights from structures | journal=[[Nature Reviews Immunology]] | volume=17 | year=2017 | pages=112-129 | url=https://doi.org/10.1038/nri.2016.134 }}  </ref> As such, viruses capable of manipulating the host cell response to infection as an immune evasion strategy exhibit greater pathogenicity.\n\n===Host factors=== \nViral pathogenesis is also largely dependent on host factors. Several viral infections have displayed a variety of effects, ranging from [[asymptomatic]] to symptomatic or even critical infection, solely based of differing host factors alone.  In particular, genetic factors, age and [[immunocompetence]] play an important role is dictating whether the viral infection can be modulated by the host.<ref name=gonzalez/><ref name =\"modernvirology\">{{cite book |title =Introduction to modern virology |edition =7 |editor1=Nigel J.

Furthermore, a number of viruses display variable pathogenicity depending on the age of the host.

It is therefore hypothesized that the host immune system and defense mechanisms might differ with age.<ref name=\"principlesvirology\">{{cite book |title=Jawetz, Melnick, & Adelberg\u2019s Medical Microbiology |edition=28|last=Cann |first=Alan |page=[https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-801946-7.00007-9] | year=2016 |publisher=[[Elsevier]] |isbn=9780128011744 |date=2016-01-04 |url-access=registration |url=https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-801946-7.00007-9 }}</ref>\n\n==Disease mechanisms: How do viral infections cause disease?==\n\nA viral infection does not always cause disease.

Acute infections tend to occur for a relatively short duration, while persistent infections are when the virus is not completely cleared from the body. In latent infections, reactivation of disease may occur a long time after the initial infection.]]\n\nImportantly, viral infections can differ by the \u201clifestyle strategy\u201d \u2013 infections can be generally categorised as acute or persistent. '''Acute infections''' occur when viral replication produces factors that interfere with host cellular processes resulting in cell death. '''Persistent infections''' happen when cells continue to survive despite a viral infection and can be further classified into '''latent''' (only the viral [[genome]] is present, there is no replication occurring) and '''chronic''' (basal levels of viral replication without stimulating an immune response). In acute infections, [[lytic cycle|lytic viruses]] are shed at high titres for rapid infection to a secondary tissue/host, whereas persistent viruses undergo shedding at lower titres for a longer duration of transmission (months to years).<ref name=\"Nathanson\" />\n\nLytic viruses are capable of destroying host cells by incurring and/or interfering with the specialised functions of host cells. An example would be the triggering of [[necrosis]] in host cells infected with the virus. Otherwise, signatures of viral infection, like the binding of HIV to co-receptors CCR5 or CXCR4, can also trigger cell death via [[apoptosis]] through host signalling cascades by immune cells. However, many viruses encode proteins that can modulate apoptosis depending on whether the infection is acute or persistent. Induction of apoptosis, such as through interaction with [[caspase]]s, will promote viral shedding for lytic viruses to facilitate transmission, while viral inhibition of apoptosis could prolong the production of virus in cells, or allow the virus to remain hidden from the immune system in chronic, persistent infections.<ref name =\"robbins\" /><ref name=gonzalez/> Nevertheless, induction of apoptosis in major immune cells or [[antigen-presenting cell]]s may also act as a mechanism of [[immunosuppression]] in persistent infections like HIV. The primary cause of immunosuppression in HIV patients is due to the depletion of [[T helper cell|CD4+ T helper cells]].<ref name=\"sherris2014\" />\n\nInterestingly, [[adenovirus]] has an '''[[Adenovirus early region 1A|E1A]]''' protein to induce apoptosis by initiating the cell cycle, and an '''[[Adenovirus E1B protein|E1B]]''' protein to block the apoptotic pathway through inhibition of caspase interaction.<ref> {{Cite journal | author=Eileen White | title=Regulation of Apoptosis by Adenovirus E1A and E1B Oncogenes | journal=Seminars in Virology | volume=8 | year=1998 | pages=505-513 | url=https://doi.org/10.1006/smvy.1998.0155 }}  </ref>\n\nPersistent viruses can sometimes [[Carcinogenesis|transform host cells into cancer cells]]. Viruses such as the [[human papillomavirus infection|human papillomavirus]] (HPV), [[human T-lymphotropic virus]] (HTLV) etc, can stimulate growth of tumours in infected hosts, either by disrupting tumour suppressor gene expression (HPV) or upregulating [[oncogene|proto-oncogene]] expression (HTLV).<ref name=\"modernvirology\" /><ref>  {{Cite journal | author=Walther Mothes | author2=Nathan M.

The stimulation of the [[Innate immune system|innate]] and [[adaptive immune system|adaptive]] immune system in response to viral infections destroys infected cells, which may lead to severe pathological consequences to the host. This damage caused by the immune system is known as virus-induced [[immunopathology]]. \n\nSpecifically, immunopathology is caused by the excessive release of [[antibody|antibodies]], [[interferon]]s and pro-inflammatory [[cytokines]], activation of the [[complement system]], or hyperactivity of [[cytotoxic T cell]]s. Secretion of interferons and other cytokines can trigger cell damage, fever and flu-like symptoms. In severe cases of certain viral infections, as in the [[Global spread of H5N1 in 2005|avian H5N1 influenza pandemic in 2005]], aberrant induction of the host immune response can elicit a [[cytokine storm]].<ref> {{Cite journal | author=Tisoncik JR, Korth MJ, Simmons CP, Farrar J, Martin TR, Katze MG | title=Into the Eye of the Cytokine Storm | journal=[[Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews]] | volume=76 | year=2012 | pages=3826\u20133833 | doi=10.1128/MMBR.05015-11 | doi-access=free }}  </ref>\n\nIn some instances, viral infection can initiate an [[autoimmunity|autoimmune response]], which occurs via two proposed mechanisms: '''molecular mimicry''' and '''bystander mechanism'''. [[Molecular mimicry]] refers to an overlap in structural similarity between a viral [[antigen]] and a self-antigen. The bystander mechanism hypothesizes the initiation of a non-specific and overreactive antiviral response that tackles self-antigens in the process. Damage caused by the host itself due to autoimmunity was observed in infections such as [[multiple sclerosis]] or the [[West Nile virus]].<ref> {{Cite journal | author=Smatti MK, Cyprian FS, Nasrallah GK, Al Thani AA, Almishal RO, Yassine HM | title=Viruses and Autoimmunity: A Review on the Potential Interaction and Molecular Mechanisms | journal=[[Viruses (journal)]] | volume=8 | year=2019 | doi=10.3390/v11080762 | doi-access=free }}  </ref>\n\n==Incubation Period==\nViruses display variable [[incubation period]]s upon virus entry into the host. The incubation period refers to the time taken for the onset of disease after first contact with the virus. The incubation period typically varies with the distance traversed by the virus to the target organ. Viruses that travel a short distance to reach their target organ have a short incubation period of one to three days. On the other hand, with generalized infections, the incubation period is longer, ranging from months to years, because of how long it takes the virus to move throughout the body and reach the target organs. Surprisingly, generalised infections by [[togaviruses]] have a short incubation period due to the direct entry of the virus into target cells through insect bites.<ref name=\"mpdd\"/>\n\nThere are several other factors that affect the incubation period. The mechanisms behind long incubation periods, months or years for example, are not completely understood yet.\n\n==Evolution of virulence==\nAs with all parasites, [[natural selection]] favours the survival of low-virulence virus strains.<ref name=\"baron\"/> Many relatively avirulent viruses in their natural host show increased virulence upon transfer to a new host species. When an [[emergent virus|emerging virus]] first invades a new host species, the hosts have little or no immunity against the virus and often suffer high [[Mortality rate|mortality]].  Hosts that survive do so because they possess a set of advantageous genes that are favourable to the [[selection pressure]], that prevents the host from dying due to infection of the novel pathogen.  These survivors then reproduce and pass on the favourable genes to their offspring while hosts that do not possess those genes are slowly eradicated by [[natural selection]], resulting in lower mortality rates in future generations. \n\nOver time, a decrease in virulence in the predominant strain is usually observed. This is because there is usually little advantage for a pathogen to kill the host before dispersal to new hosts, so viruses may evolve naturally to become less virulent to prolong survival in infected hosts to boost transmission. Likewise, the host will evolve to develop genetic resistance against the virus over time.<ref name=\"baron\"/>\n\nA paradigm of the evolution of virulence in emerging virus is the case of [[myxomatosis]] in rabbits. The release of wild European rabbits in 1859 into Victoria, Australia for sport resulted in a rabbit plague. In order to curb with rabbit overpopulation, [[myxoma virus]], a lethal species-specific poxvirus responsible for myxomatosis in rabbits, was deliberately released in South Australia in 1950. This led to a 90% decrease in rabbit populations, and the disease became [[endemic]] in a span of five years. Significantly, severely attenuated strains of the myxoma virus were detected in merely 2 years of its release, and genetic resistance in rabbits emerged within seven years.<ref name=\"Kerr2012\">  {{Cite journal | author=Peter J Kerr | title=Myxomatosis in Australia and Europe: A model for emerging infectious diseases | journal=[[Antiviral Research]] | volume=93 | year=2012 | pages=387-415 | url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2012.01.009 }}  </ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Pathogen]]\n*[[Pathogenesis]]\n*[[List of human diseases associated with infectious pathogens]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Virology]]\n", "name_user": "Isabellelyy", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eDamage caused by the virus", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_pathogenesis"}
