The Sharks had also appeared in the [[1997 Super League (Australia) season|1997 Super League]] grand final, losing to the [[Brisbane Broncos]]. The last time Melbourne and Cronulla had faced each other in a finals series was in [[2008 NRL season|2008]] when the Storm denied the Sharks with a decisive 28-0 win to claim a spot against the Sea Eagles in the [[2008 NRL Grand Final|grand final]].\n\n===2016 season===\nThe [[Melbourne Storm]] and the [[Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks]] met twice during the [[2016 NRL season#Regular season|regular NRL season]]; in round 4 and round 26.

Also, without his healing still being strong enough, he is slowly dying from adamantium poisoning. He spends his days working as a chauffeur under his birth name and hustling for prescription drugs along the border between the [[United States]] and [[Mexico]]. He and [[Caliban (comics)|Caliban]] live in an abandoned smelting plant across the border in Mexico and care for the senile Xavier who had inadvertently killed several X-Men in a seizure-induced psychic attack one year earlier that also injured some people in Westchester County. He is tasked by Transigen's former nurse Gabriela Lopez to escort the 11-year-old [[X-23|Laura]] to a place in [[North Dakota]] called \"Eden.\" Logan, Charles and Laura escape Transigen's [[Reavers (comics)|hunters]] led by [[Donald Pierce]] and discover that Laura is Logan's \"daughter\" bred from his DNA. After accepting shelter from the Munson family they helped on the highway, Xavier is killed by a [[Albert (comics)|feral clone of Wolverine]] to which Logan and Laura escape and bury Xavier's body near a lake. Eventually, Logan and Laura arrive at Eden, a safe haven run by [[Rictor]] and former Transigen test subjects. There, Logan learns that the children will make an eight-mile journey across the forest to the Canadian-American border and entrusts Laura to lead before departing on his own. But when the children are located and captured, Logan uses a mutant serum provided by Rictor to restore his strength and healing factor. He meets [[Zander Rice]], killing the mutant virus' creator. Despite Rice and Pierce being killed, Logan is no match for his clone impaling him through a tree with his healing factor now gone. Laura shoots the clone in the head with an adamantium bullet that Logan had kept with him for years. Logan succumbs to his wounds and dies in Laura's arms, however, Laura and the children bury him before continuing the journey across the border. Laura places the cross on his grave on its side to create an \"X\" to honor him as the last X-Man.

He is fought inside a pub while playing as [[Eddie Brock#Ultimate Marvel|Venom]], after throwing his motorcyle through the wall of the pub, causing Wolverine to attack Venom in retaliation. However, Venom proves stronger and defeats Wolverine, knocking him unconscious.\n* Wolverine appears as both an ally and a [[boss (video gaming)|boss]] in ''[[Spider-Man: Web of Shadows]]'', voiced by [[Steve Blum]]. He first appears shortly before the [[Symbiote (comics)|symbiote]] invasion that will consume Manhattan, ambushing Spider-Man at [[Hell's Kitchen]], as he can smell symbiotes and believes him to be one. The two engage in a brief battle, during which he asks Spider-Man several questions to determine if Spider-Man is a symbiote or not. Regardless of the player giving wrong answers, Wolverine eventually trusts Spider-Man and the two settle their differences. Afterwards, they begin briefly working together to track down and defeat several hidden symbiotes, and Wolverine becomes an ally that the player can summon at any time during gameplay to help them fight enemies. Later, during the symbiote invasion, Wolverine helps Spider-Man evacuate a church full of civilians. After the evacuation is complete, Wolverine is attacked by two burly Symbiotes, which dog pile him to the ground and, thus, turn into a monstrous symbiote version of himself, fueled by rage. Symbiote Wolverine then battles Spider-Man, even using some symbiote pods to gain a temporary armor, but is ultimately defeated by the web-slinger. Depending on the player's choice, Spider-Man can either let Wolverine remove the symbiote himself by using his claws to gut himself, or remove the symbiote by force and then rip Wolverine in half (ironically, Wolverine has suggested doing this to Spider-Man earlier, if he ever became infected by a symbiote); the latter choice will cause Wolverine to angrily swear to kill Spider-Man, thus making Wolverine unavailable as an ally for the rest of the game. If the player chooses to activate the device meant to destroy all the symbiotes and stop the invasion, Wolverine is seen in the final mission of the game, fighting the symbiotes aboard the [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] [[Helicarrier]] alongside the other hero allies, while Spider-Man plants bombs to destroy the Helicarrier and stop [[Eddie Brock|Venom]] for good. In both evil endings (if the player chose to destroy the device), after Spider-Man takes over the symbiote army and rules over Manhattan, [[Black Widow (Natasha Romanova)|Black Widow]] enlists a symbiote infected Wolverine, who this time is in full control of his symbiote, to hunt Spider-Man down and bring him to her dead or alive, with Symbiote Wolverine opting for the former option. \n**In the [[PlayStation 2]] and [[PlayStation Portable|PSP]] versions of the game, Wolverine is an assist character who will slash enemies with his claws.\n* The Ultimate Marvel version of Wolverine is referenced in ''[[Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions]]''. He is mentioned in [[Deadpool#Ultimate Marvel|Deadpool]]'s level in the Ultimate dimension, where Deadpool briefly refers to the time he and Spider-Man switched brains.

This leads to ''[[X2 (film)|X2]]'' (2003) where Logan, finding nothing left of Alkali's base and returning to Professor X's [[X-Mansion|school for mutants]] where he encounters [[William Stryker]], to which he and the X-Men teams up with Magneto and [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]] to stop Stryker. During a confrontation with Stryker and [[Lady Deathstrike]], Wolverine regains some of his memory but opts to remain with the X-Men over Stryker's objections, while Stryker is killed when Alkali's base floods after sustaining damage.

With his half-brother [[Sabretooth (comics)|Victor Creed]], Howlett spends the next century fighting in numerous wars including the [[Vietnam War]], where he's briefly a member of Stryker's team before leaving due to the group's disregard for life. However, Howlett's past catches up to him despite his relationship with [[Silver Fox (comics)|Kayla Silverfox]] with both the [[Weapon X]] project in which he's pitted against Stryker and Creed. Though Howlett and Creed work together to fight and kill Weapon XI, Stryker shoots Howlett with [[adamantium]] bullets before being arrested. Though he survives, his memory is lost.\n\nWolverine also makes a cameo appearance in ''[[X-Men: First Class]]'' (2011) where Logan is seen when Charles Xavier and Erik Lehnsherr are recruiting mutants to the X-Men, telling the two mutants \"Go fuck yourselves.\"\n\nIn the second ''Wolverine'' film ''[[The Wolverine (film)|The Wolverine]]'' (2013), the guilt-ridden Logan, having finally regained his memory, lives in [[Ronin (Marvel Comics)|isolation]] in the Yukon one year after ''X-Men: The Last Stand''. He is sought by [[Silver Samurai|Ichir\u014d Yashida]] wanting to repay Logan for being saved during World War II, but Logan refuses to have his healing powers transferred into Yashida. With [[Yukio (comics)|Yukio]] as his side, this leads to a series of events where Wolverine protects [[Mariko Yashida]] from [[Shingen Yashida]], his healing powers being damaged, his adamantium claws being severed and he finally letting go of his guilt over Jean's death. After returning to the United States, Logan finds himself approached by Magneto and Professor X while learning of a new threat to all mutants. A deleted scene shows the titular character's yellow costume (as worn in the comics) in a suitcase. \n\nIn ''[[X-Men: Days of Future Past]]'' (2014), the world is essentially controlled by [[Sentinels (comics)|Sentinels]] by 2023, where Wolverine has teamed up with surviving mutants and the X-Men. Logan's mind is transferred back in time into his 1973 self to help the younger Charles and Lehnsherr as well as Hank McCoy deter Mystique from assassinating [[Bolivar Trask]], preventing the apocalyptic future from occurring. Once his mission is fulfilled, the original timeline is erased and Wolverine returns to a changed future, while his past self regains consciousness with no memory of his future self's activities. Due to the changes, [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] and Jean are shown alive and he himself is a teacher in Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters. \n\nWolverine does not appear in person in ''[[Deadpool (film)|Deadpool]]'' (2016) but he and Jackman are referenced in a comical fashion multiple times with [[Deadpool]] stating \"Whose balls did I have to fondle to get my very own movie. Hint: Rhymes with polverine.\" and a mask made from a photograph of Jackman is worn by Deadpool to represent Wolverine.\n\nWolverine makes a brief appearance in ''[[X-Men: Apocalypse]]'' (2016) as Weapon X. Having been captured by Stryker at some point, Logan has been given an adamantium skeleton and subject to brutal mental conditioning, leaving him on a more feral state than a human level. When some of the X-Men are captured by Stryker's men, Jean, Scott and [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] infiltrate Stryker's base and find a cage with Jean sensing the human mind underneath and releasing him so that he can help. After he tears through Stryker's forces, the three mutants find him and Jean telepathically restores some of Logan's human memories before running off at a small side-exit into the snow.{{efn|Writer [[Simon Kinberg]] explained that the character was originally intended to have a larger role in the film, saying \"There was always a notion that we wanted Wolverine to be in the movie. We wanted to find a way to feature him in the film, partly because Bryan [Singer] and I love Hugh [Jackman] so much. We love the character, obviously, and he\u2019s such a huge part of the franchise. There were a lot of iterations of how Wolverine would enter and exit the movie. There was a version when he was going to come in at the midpoint of the film and be like the drill sergeant for the kids and take over as their leader.

By 2029, Logan's healing factor had suffered severe deterioration, and caused him to finally begin showing his age due to Transigen's virus unleashed to mutants. Also, without his healing still being strong enough, he is slowly dying from adamantium poisoning. He spends his days working as a chauffeur under his birth name and hustling for prescription drugs along the border between the [[United States]] and [[Mexico]]. He and [[Caliban (comics)|Caliban]] live in an abandoned smelting plant across the border in Mexico and care for the senile Xavier who had inadvertently killed several X-Men in a seizure-induced psychic attack one year earlier that also injured some people in Westchester County. He is tasked by Transigen's former nurse Gabriela Lopez to escort the 11-year-old [[X-23|Laura]] to a place in [[North Dakota]] called \"Eden.\" Logan, Charles and Laura escape Transigen's [[Reavers (comics)|hunters]] led by [[Donald Pierce]] and discover that Laura is Logan's \"daughter\" bred from his DNA. After accepting shelter from the Munson family they helped on the highway, Xavier is killed by a [[Albert (comics)|feral clone of Wolverine]] to which Logan and Laura escape and bury Xavier's body near a lake. Eventually, Logan and Laura arrive at Eden, a safe haven run by [[Rictor]] and former Transigen test subjects. There, Logan learns that the children will make an eight-mile journey across the forest to the Canadian-American border and entrusts Laura to lead before departing on his own. But when the children are located and captured, Logan uses a mutant serum provided by Rictor to restore his strength and healing factor. He meets [[Zander Rice]], killing the mutant virus' creator. Despite Rice and Pierce being killed, Logan is no match for his clone impaling him through a tree with his healing factor now gone. Laura shoots the clone in the head with an adamantium bullet that Logan had kept with him for years. Logan succumbs to his wounds and dies in Laura's arms, however, Laura and the children bury him before continuing the journey across the border. Laura places the cross on his grave on its side to create an \"X\" to honor him as the last X-Man.

He is fought inside a pub while playing as [[Eddie Brock#Ultimate Marvel|Venom]], after throwing his motorcyle through the wall of the pub, causing Wolverine to attack Venom in retaliation. However, Venom proves stronger and defeats Wolverine, knocking him unconscious.\n* Wolverine appears as both an ally and a [[boss (video gaming)|boss]] in ''[[Spider-Man: Web of Shadows]]'', voiced by [[Steve Blum]]. He first appears shortly before the [[Symbiote (comics)|symbiote]] invasion that will consume Manhattan, ambushing Spider-Man at [[Hell's Kitchen]], as he can smell symbiotes and believes him to be one. The two engage in a brief battle, during which he asks Spider-Man several questions to determine if Spider-Man is a symbiote or not. Regardless of the player giving wrong answers, Wolverine eventually trusts Spider-Man and the two settle their differences. Afterwards, they begin briefly working together to track down and defeat several hidden symbiotes, and Wolverine becomes an ally that the player can summon at any time during gameplay to help them fight enemies. Later, during the symbiote invasion, Wolverine helps Spider-Man evacuate a church full of civilians. After the evacuation is complete, Wolverine is attacked by two burly Symbiotes, which dog pile him to the ground and, thus, turn into a monstrous symbiote version of himself, fueled by rage. Symbiote Wolverine then battles Spider-Man, even using some symbiote pods to gain a temporary armor, but is ultimately defeated by the web-slinger. Depending on the player's choice, Spider-Man can either let Wolverine remove the symbiote himself by using his claws to gut himself, or remove the symbiote by force and then rip Wolverine in half (ironically, Wolverine has suggested doing this to Spider-Man earlier, if he ever became infected by a symbiote); the latter choice will cause Wolverine to angrily swear to kill Spider-Man, thus making Wolverine unavailable as an ally for the rest of the game. If the player chooses to activate the device meant to destroy all the symbiotes and stop the invasion, Wolverine is seen in the final mission of the game, fighting the symbiotes aboard the [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] [[Helicarrier]] alongside the other hero allies, while Spider-Man plants bombs to destroy the Helicarrier and stop [[Eddie Brock|Venom]] for good. In both evil endings (if the player chose to destroy the device), after Spider-Man takes over the symbiote army and rules over Manhattan, [[Black Widow (Natasha Romanova)|Black Widow]] enlists a symbiote infected Wolverine, who this time is in full control of his symbiote, to hunt Spider-Man down and bring him to her dead or alive, with Symbiote Wolverine opting for the former option. \n**In the [[PlayStation 2]] and [[PlayStation Portable|PSP]] versions of the game, Wolverine is an assist character who will slash enemies with his claws.\n* The Ultimate Marvel version of Wolverine is referenced in ''[[Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions]]''. He is mentioned in [[Deadpool#Ultimate Marvel|Deadpool]]'s level in the Ultimate dimension, where Deadpool briefly refers to the time he and Spider-Man switched brains.

He writes also as '''Jonathan Grimwood''' (literary fiction) and '''Jack Grimwood''' (crime fiction and thrillers).\n\n==Biography==\nGrimwood was born in 1953 in Valletta, Malta, grew up in Malta, Britain, Southeast Asia and Norway in the 1960s and 1970s. He studied at [[Kingston upon Thames|Kingston]] University, then worked in publishing and as a freelance writer for magazines and newspapers including ''[[The Guardian]]'', ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', ''[[The Times]]'', and ''[[The Independent]]''. He now lives in [[Paris]] and [[Winchester]] and is married to the journalist and novelist [[Sam Baker (writer)|Sam Baker]], with a son, Jamie, from a previous marriage.\n\nMuch of his early work within [[SF&F]] can be described as [[post-cyberpunk]]. He won a [[BSFA Award|British Science Fiction Association award]] for ''[[Arabesk trilogy#Felaheen|Felaheen]]'' in 2003,<ref name=\"WWE-2003\">{{cite web |url=http://www.worldswithoutend.com/books_year_index.asp?year=2003 |title=2003 Award Winners & Nominees |work=Worlds Without End |accessdate=1 July 2009 }}</ref> was short-listed for the [[Arthur C.

Campbell Memorial Award for Best Science Fiction Novel|John W. Campbell Memorial Award]] in 2002 for ''Pashazade''.<ref name=\"WWE-2002\"/> His fourth book is loosely based on [[Stanley J. Weyman|Stanley Weyman]]'s Victorian novel ''[[Under the Red Robe (novel)|Under the Red Robe]]''. ''End of the World Blues'' was also short-listed for the 2007 [[Arthur C. Clarke Award]].<ref name=\"WWE-2007\">{{cite web |url=http://www.worldswithoutend.com/books_year_index.asp?year=2007 |title=2007 Award Winners & Nominees |work=Worlds Without End |accessdate=1 July 2009 }}</ref>\nThe following were nominated in the SF novel category in the [[Locus Award]]s \u2013 ''Felaheen, The Third Arabesk'' (2004); ''Stamping Butterflies'' (2005); ''9Tail Fox'' (2006); ''End of the World Blues'' (2007).\n\nThe French translation of his 2013 literary novel ''[[The Last Banquet]]'', written as Jonathan Grimwood, was shortlisted in January 2015 for {{lang|fr|[[Le Prix Montesquieu]]}},<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.labrede-montesquieu.fr/Le-prix-litteraire.html |title=Le prix litt\u00e9raire |publisher=La Br\u00e8de Montesquieu }}</ref> as ''{{lang|fr|[[Le Dernier Banquet]]}}'', 2014, ''{{lang|fr|\u00c9ditions Terra Nova}}'', translation by [[Carole Delporte]].\n\nGrimwood's [[SF&F]] work tends to be of a quasi-[[alternate history]] genre. In the first four novels, set in the 22nd century, the [[point of divergence]] is the [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870, where Grimwood posits a reality where [[Napoleon III]]'s France defeats [[Otto von Bismarck]]'s Prussia, causing the [[German Empire]] never to form and the [[Second French Empire]] never to collapse. In the [[Arabesk trilogy|''Arabesk'' trilogy]], the point of divergence is in 1915, with [[Woodrow Wilson]] brokering an earlier peace so that World War I barely expanded outside of the Balkans; the books are set in a liberal Islamic [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] North Africa in the 21st century, mainly centring on El Iskandriya ([[Alexandria]]). By contrast, there is little in ''Stamping Butterflies'', ''[[9tail Fox]]'' or ''End of the World Blues'' to suggest that the books are not set in our reality.\n\n''[[The Fallen Blade]]'' is the first of three novels set in an alternative early-15th century featuring Tycho, [[fallen angel]] and assassin, at the Venetian court, in a Venice where [[Marco Polo]]'s family have been hereditary dukes for five generations and the [[Mongols|Mongol]] emperor [[Timur|Tamberlaine]] has conquered China, making him the most powerful ruler in the world. The second novel in the Assassini series, ''[[The Outcast Blade]]'' was published in 2012, with the third ''[[The Exiled Blade]]'' published 2013. The novels take as a template sequences and tropes from [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s plays ''[[Othello]]'', ''[[Hamlet]]'' and ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]''. The novels have been sold into a number of languages.\n\nHis first literary novel, ''The Last Banquet'', as Jonathan Grimwood, was published in 2013 by [[Canongate Books]]in the UK, [[Europa Editions]] in the US, and \u00c9ditions Terra Nova in France, among others. Referencing [[Benjamin Franklin]], [[Voltaire]] and the [[Marquis de Sade]] \u2014 and picaresque in the style of [[Candide]] \u2014 it tells the semi magic realist tale of an aristocrat prepared to eat anything, and covers the run up to the [[French Revolution]] from the early to late 18th century.

The first, [[Moskva (novel)|Moskva]], Spring 2016, is set in 1980s Soviet Moscow. The second, [[Nightfall Berlin]] is due Spring 2017.\n\nGrimwood was guest of honour at [[Novacon]] in 2003, at Kontext (in [[Uppsala]], Sweden) in 2008, at [[Eastercon]] LX (the 60th British National [[Science fiction convention|Science Fiction Convention]]) in 2009, and at Bristolcon in 2014.\n\nHe was a judge for the 2010 Arthur C Clarke Award presented to [[China Mi\u00e9ville]] for ''[[The City & the City]]''; and for the 2011 award presented to [[Lauren Beukes]] for ''[[Zoo City]]''.

In ''Stamping Butterflies'', as well as some of the characters having a mental link (across several centuries in both directions), one character has conversations with an alien AI known as \"the Library\".\n\nSecondly, he frequently alternates the main narrative with either a continuous story or a series of discontinuous [[flashback (narrative)|flashback]]s, often to the childhood of a central character.  He uses this to explain events in the past in such a way that their connection to the plot only becomes evident later in the book, at around the point its effects are felt in the main storyline.\n\nHe has described his writing process as analogous to building a house:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.orbitbooks.net/2011/01/18/how-i-write/ |title=How I Write \u2013 Orbit }}</ref>\n\n{{Quote|1=\nYou lay down foundations, put up walls, fix roof supports in place, tile the roof and begin to cut in wiring and plumbing before you get to plaster board and long before you get to paint.

He writes also as '''Jonathan Grimwood''' (literary fiction) and '''Jack Grimwood''' (crime fiction and thrillers).\n\n==Biography==\nGrimwood was born in 1953 in Valletta, Malta, grew up in Malta, Britain, Southeast Asia and Norway in the 1960s and 1970s. He studied at [[Kingston upon Thames|Kingston]] University, then worked in publishing and as a freelance writer for magazines and newspapers including ''[[The Guardian]]'', ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', ''[[The Times]]'', and ''[[The Independent]]''. He now lives in [[Paris]] and [[Winchester]] and is married to the journalist and novelist [[Sam Baker (writer)|Sam Baker]], with a son, Jamie, from a previous marriage.\n\nMuch of his early work within [[SF&F]] can be described as [[post-cyberpunk]]. He won a [[BSFA Award|British Science Fiction Association award]] for ''[[Arabesk trilogy#Felaheen|Felaheen]]'' in 2003,<ref name=\"WWE-2003\">{{cite web |url=http://www.worldswithoutend.com/books_year_index.asp?year=2003 |title=2003 Award Winners & Nominees |work=Worlds Without End |accessdate=1 July 2009 }}</ref> was short-listed for the [[Arthur C.

Campbell Memorial Award for Best Science Fiction Novel|John W. Campbell Memorial Award]] in 2002 for ''Pashazade''.<ref name=\"WWE-2002\"/> His fourth book is loosely based on [[Stanley J. Weyman|Stanley Weyman]]'s Victorian novel ''[[Under the Red Robe (novel)|Under the Red Robe]]''. ''End of the World Blues'' was also short-listed for the 2007 [[Arthur C. Clarke Award]].<ref name=\"WWE-2007\">{{cite web |url=http://www.worldswithoutend.com/books_year_index.asp?year=2007 |title=2007 Award Winners & Nominees |work=Worlds Without End |accessdate=1 July 2009 }}</ref>\nThe following were nominated in the SF novel category in the [[Locus Award]]s \u2013 ''Felaheen, The Third Arabesk'' (2004); ''Stamping Butterflies'' (2005); ''9Tail Fox'' (2006); ''End of the World Blues'' (2007).\n\nThe French translation of his 2013 literary novel ''[[The Last Banquet]]'', written as Jonathan Grimwood, was shortlisted in January 2015 for {{lang|fr|[[Le Prix Montesquieu]]}},<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.labrede-montesquieu.fr/Le-prix-litteraire.html |title=Le prix litt\u00e9raire |publisher=La Br\u00e8de Montesquieu }}</ref> as ''{{lang|fr|[[Le Dernier Banquet]]}}'', 2014, ''{{lang|fr|\u00c9ditions Terra Nova}}'', translation by [[Carole Delporte]].\n\nGrimwood's [[SF&F]] work tends to be of a quasi-[[alternate history]] genre. In the first four novels, set in the 22nd century, the [[point of divergence]] is the [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870, where Grimwood posits a reality where [[Napoleon III]]'s France defeats [[Otto von Bismarck]]'s Prussia, causing the [[German Empire]] never to form and the [[Second French Empire]] never to collapse. In the [[Arabesk trilogy|''Arabesk'' trilogy]], the point of divergence is in 1915, with [[Woodrow Wilson]] brokering an earlier peace so that World War I barely expanded outside of the Balkans; the books are set in a liberal Islamic [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] North Africa in the 21st century, mainly centring on El Iskandriya ([[Alexandria]]). By contrast, there is little in ''Stamping Butterflies'', ''[[9tail Fox]]'' or ''End of the World Blues'' to suggest that the books are not set in our reality.\n\n''[[The Fallen Blade]]'' is the first of three novels set in an alternative early-15th century featuring Tycho, [[fallen angel]] and assassin, at the Venetian court, in a Venice where [[Marco Polo]]'s family have been hereditary dukes for five generations and the [[Mongols|Mongol]] emperor [[Timur|Tamberlaine]] has conquered China, making him the most powerful ruler in the world. The second novel in the Assassini series, ''[[The Outcast Blade]]'' was published in 2012, with the third ''[[The Exiled Blade]]'' published 2013. The novels take as a template sequences and tropes from [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s plays ''[[Othello]]'', ''[[Hamlet]]'' and ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]''. The novels have been sold into a number of languages.\n\nHis first literary novel, ''The Last Banquet'', as Jonathan Grimwood, was published in 2013 by [[Canongate Books]]in the UK, [[Europa Editions]] in the US, and \u00c9ditions Terra Nova in France, among others. Referencing [[Benjamin Franklin]], [[Voltaire]] and the [[Marquis de Sade]] \u2014 and picaresque in the style of [[Candide]] \u2014 it tells the semi magic realist tale of an aristocrat prepared to eat anything, and covers the run up to the [[French Revolution]] from the early to late 18th century.

His developments received universal recognition and serve as a basis for considerable part of the optical designs used today.\n\n==Biography==\n\nLudwig Jakob Bertele was born 25 December 1900 in [[Munich]], to an architect\u2019s family.\n\nIn 1916 he began to work as an assistant of optics designer in [[Rodenstock GmbH|Rodenstock]] firm in Munich. In 1919 he went to [[Dresden]] to work in {{Interlanguage link multi|Ernemann|de|3=Ernemann|lt=Ernemann Company (Krupp-Ernemann Kinoapparate AG)}}. He worked there under the supervision of <!-- professor doctor -->August Klughardt as designer of optics.<ref name=\"Hartmut Thiele 2007, p. 34\">Hartmut Thiele. Entwicklung und Beschreibung der Photoobjektive und ihre Erfinder; Carl Zeiss Jena, 2. Auflage mit erweiterten Tabellen, Privatdruck M\u00fcnchen 2007, p. 34</ref>\n\nIn 1919 Ludwig Bertele started to develop a type of optical scheme, subsequently known as {{Interlanguage link multi|Ernostar|de}}. He has taken for a basis an optical scheme of cinema lens [[Ultrastigmat]], a modified [[Cooke triplet|triplet]], which was calculated by [[Charles C. Minor]] in 1916 and being produced by [[Gundlach Company]]. The main purpose was the increasing of light-gathering power and diminution of [[Optical aberration|aberration]].\n\nIn 1923, after four years of intensive efforts, he has patented<ref name=\"first\">Patents for lens Ernostar:\n* Great Britain \u2116 191,702,\n* Germany \u2116 401,274,\n* USA \u2116 1,584,271.</ref> his first ultra high-aperture objective Ernostar f/2, its successive versions followed until 1926. That lens was fitted to the [[Ermanox]] camera, which was specially developed for photo [[reportage]]. This was the first camera having sufficient speed and image quality for candid [[photography]] in available light conditions. The pictures of prominent political figures taken with it by [[Erich Salomon]] are widely\nknown.<ref>Rudolf Kingslake. A history of photographic lens. Academic Press {{ISBN|0-12-408640-3}}, San Diego, USA 1989, p. 111</ref>\n\nAfter the foundation of [[Zeiss Ikon]] in 1926, as a result of integration of companies [[ICA AG|ICA (Internationale Camera Actiengesellschaft)]], [[Goerz (company)|Optische Anstalt CP Goerz]], [[Contessa-Nettel]] and {{Interlanguage link multi|Ernemann|de|3=Ernemann|lt=Ernemann-Werke}} with [[Carl Zeiss]], Ludwig Bertele continued his work in [[Dresden]] except for a short trip to United States in 1929. An experimental optical workshop was given at the disposal of Bertele. That shop made all examples and prototypes of Bertele's calculations. Every lens got a unique five-cipher number; often a current number of the variant was also engraved.<ref name=\"Hartmut Thiele 2007, p. 34\"/>\n\nIn the late 1920s Bertele began the development of a series of excellent lenses, based generally on the second Ernostar type, which was developed in 1924 (i.e., each lens had a single positive element in front of it followed by a thick negative meniscus-shaped component, with a positive element behind). In 1931, the first example of such lenses appeared. It received the name [[Zeiss Sonnar|Sonnar]].<ref name=\"second\">Patents for lens Sonnar:\n* Great Britain \u2116 383,591,\n* Germany \u2116 570,983,\n* USA \u2116 1,998,704.</ref>\n\nThis lens consisted of seven elements in three groups with a maximum [[aperture]] of f/2. The main difference from his predecessor Ernostar was a lesser number of optical groups and therefore lesser light dispersion and higher [[Display contrast|contrast]]. Those lenses proved extraordinarily successful and got high marks from specialists.\n\nIn 1932 a Sonnar f/1.5 appeared, which was fitted to [[Zeiss Ikon]]'s 35&nbsp;mm [[Contax]] cameras. with Sonnar versions following with [[focal length]]s from 50 to 300&nbsp;mm been developed until 1940.\n\nAround 1934, Bertele, having taken the scheme of Sonnar as a basis, created the first wide-angle lens [[Biogon]] with a 60\u00b0 viewing angle.\n\nIn 1935, Ludwig Bertele calculated the Sonnar 180mm/2.8 on the occasion of the [[1936 Summer Olympics|XI summer Olympic Games]] of 1936 in [[Berlin]] - hence the name \"Olympia Sonnar\". It was a fabulous lens, which made an image of highest quality with beautiful [[bokeh]]. This lens has been appreciated by photographers and collectors up to now.\n\nBetween 1943 and 1945, Ludwig Bertele was working in {{Interlanguage link multi|C. A. Steinheil & S\u00f6hne|de|3=C. A. Steinheil & S\u00f6hne|lt=Steinheil}} firm, situated in [[Munich]]. That firm worked for German weapons manufacturers, a/o, the German Ministry of aviation.\n\nAs Zeiss in Dresden and Jena had become part of the Soviet Zone of Occupation in 1945, they were required to transfer these designs as well as machinery and staff for training to Russia and the Ukraine, where all Sonnars were produced in vast numbers under the \"Jupiter\" designation, constituting by far the most desirable optical products from behind the Iron Curtain until this day.  The East and West German Zeiss production was tiny by comparison, while Ludwig Bertele, fortunately in absence, had become the most significant optical designer of the former Soviet Union for over four decades.\n\nIn 1946, he moved to Switzerland, where he founded an optical bureau and started to work in Wild Heerbrugg Company (now [[Leica Geosystems]]) in the field of [[photogrammetry]] and geodesic devices. In 1950 he created an aerial 90\u00b0 viewing-angle lens Aviogon, which was free from optical aberrations. [[Distortion]] was less than 10&nbsp;[[\u00b5m]] at any point of the image field, and the [[Optical resolution|resolution]] at F/4.5 was excellent. The new lens quickly replaced the Topogon and Metrogon as the standard lens for aerial photography and photogrammetry. This lens, as well as 120\u00b0 Super Aviogon, which appeared in 1956, won a great number of prizes and merited general recognition.<ref>Rudolf Kingslake. A history of photographic lens.

His developments received universal recognition and serve as a basis for considerable part of the optical designs used today.\n\n==Biography==\n\nLudwig Jakob Bertele was born 25 December 1900 in [[Munich]], to an architect\u2019s family.\n\nIn 1916 he began to work as an assistant of optics designer in [[Rodenstock GmbH|Rodenstock]] firm in Munich. In 1919 he went to [[Dresden]] to work in {{Interlanguage link multi|Ernemann|de|3=Ernemann|lt=Ernemann Company (Krupp-Ernemann Kinoapparate AG)}}. He worked there under the supervision of <!-- professor doctor -->August Klughardt as designer of optics.<ref name=\"Hartmut Thiele 2007, p. 34\">Hartmut Thiele.

Auflage mit erweiterten Tabellen, Privatdruck M\u00fcnchen 2007, p. 34</ref>\n\nIn 1919 Ludwig Bertele started to develop a type of optical scheme, subsequently known as {{Interlanguage link multi|Ernostar|de}}. He has taken for a basis an optical scheme of cinema lens [[Ultrastigmat]], a modified [[Cooke triplet|triplet]], which was calculated by [[Charles C. Minor]] in 1916 and being produced by [[Gundlach Company]]. The main purpose was the increasing of light-gathering power and diminution of [[Optical aberration|aberration]].\n\nIn 1923, after four years of intensive efforts, he has patented<ref name=\"first\">Patents for lens Ernostar:\n* Great Britain \u2116 191,702,\n* Germany \u2116 401,274,\n* USA \u2116 1,584,271.</ref> his first ultra high-aperture objective Ernostar f/2, its successive versions followed until 1926. That lens was fitted to the [[Ermanox]] camera, which was specially developed for photo [[reportage]]. This was the first camera having sufficient speed and image quality for candid [[photography]] in available light conditions. The pictures of prominent political figures taken with it by [[Erich Salomon]] are widely\nknown.<ref>Rudolf Kingslake. A history of photographic lens. Academic Press {{ISBN|0-12-408640-3}}, San Diego, USA 1989, p. 111</ref>\n\nAfter the foundation of [[Zeiss Ikon]] in 1926, as a result of integration of companies [[ICA AG|ICA (Internationale Camera Actiengesellschaft)]], [[Goerz (company)|Optische Anstalt CP Goerz]], [[Contessa-Nettel]] and {{Interlanguage link multi|Ernemann|de|3=Ernemann|lt=Ernemann-Werke}} with [[Carl Zeiss]], Ludwig Bertele continued his work in [[Dresden]] except for a short trip to United States in 1929. An experimental optical workshop was given at the disposal of Bertele. That shop made all examples and prototypes of Bertele's calculations. Every lens got a unique five-cipher number; often a current number of the variant was also engraved.<ref name=\"Hartmut Thiele 2007, p. 34\"/>\n\nIn the late 1920s Bertele began the development of a series of excellent lenses, based generally on the second Ernostar type, which was developed in 1924 (i.e., each lens had a single positive element in front of it followed by a thick negative meniscus-shaped component, with a positive element behind). In 1931, the first example of such lenses appeared. It received the name [[Zeiss Sonnar|Sonnar]].<ref name=\"second\">Patents for lens Sonnar:\n* Great Britain \u2116 383,591,\n* Germany \u2116 570,983,\n* USA \u2116 1,998,704.</ref>\n\nThis lens consisted of seven elements in three groups with a maximum [[aperture]] of f/2. The main difference from his predecessor Ernostar was a lesser number of optical groups and therefore lesser light dispersion and higher [[Display contrast|contrast]]. Those lenses proved extraordinarily successful and got high marks from specialists.\n\nIn 1932 a Sonnar f/1.5 appeared, which was fitted to [[Zeiss Ikon]]'s 35&nbsp;mm [[Contax]] cameras. with Sonnar versions following with [[focal length]]s from 50 to 300&nbsp;mm been developed until 1940.\n\nAround 1934, Bertele, having taken the scheme of Sonnar as a basis, created the first wide-angle lens [[Biogon]] with a 60\u00b0 viewing angle.\n\nIn 1935, Ludwig Bertele calculated the Sonnar 180mm/2.8 on the occasion of the [[1936 Summer Olympics|XI summer Olympic Games]] of 1936 in [[Berlin]] - hence the name \"Olympia Sonnar\". It was a fabulous lens, which made an image of highest quality with beautiful [[bokeh]]. This lens has been appreciated by photographers and collectors up to now.\n\nBetween 1943 and 1945, Ludwig Bertele was working in {{Interlanguage link multi|C. A. Steinheil & S\u00f6hne|de|3=C. A. Steinheil & S\u00f6hne|lt=Steinheil}} firm, situated in [[Munich]]. That firm worked for Imperial Ministry of aviation.\n\nAs Zeiss in Dresden and Jena had become part of the Soviet Zone of Occupation in 1945, they were required to transfer these designs as well as machinery and staff for training to Russia and the Ukraine, where all Sonnars were produced in vast numbers under the \"Jupiter\" designation, constituting by far the most desirable optical products from behind the Iron Curtain until this day.  The East and West German Zeiss production was tiny by comparison, while Ludwig Bertele, fortunately in absence, had become the most significant optical designer of the former Soviet Union for over four decades.\n\nIn 1946, he moved to Switzerland, where he founded an optical bureau and started to work in Wild Heerbrugg Company (now [[Leica Geosystems]]) in the field of [[photogrammetry]] and geodesic devices. In 1950 he created an aerial 90\u00b0 viewing-angle lens Aviogon, which was free from optical aberrations. [[Distortion]] was less than 10&nbsp;[[\u00b5m]] at any point of the image field, and the [[Optical resolution|resolution]] at F/4.5 was excellent. The new lens quickly replaced the Topogon and Metrogon as the standard lens for aerial photography and photogrammetry. This lens, as well as 120\u00b0 Super Aviogon, which appeared in 1956, won a great number of prizes and merited general recognition.<ref>Rudolf Kingslake. A history of photographic lens.

James's letters were written by Mar, Kinloss, and perhaps Mar's kinsman, [[Thomas Erskine, 1st Earl of Kellie|Thomas Erskine of Gogar]].<ref>Alexander Courtney, 'The Secret Correspondence of James VI, 1601-3', in Susan Doran and Paulina Kewes, ''Doubtful and dangerous: The question of the succession in late Elizabethan England'' (Manchester, 2014), p. 139: For Thomas Erskine, see Hailes (1766), p. 97, 102, 111, 137, 209.</ref> Some of the letters were sent to England as if they were meant for the [[Henri, Duke of Rohan|Duke of Rohan]] in France, and so arrived in England to be added to the '[[diplomatic bag]]'. The 18th-century historian [[Thomas Birch]] suggested that a Scottish representative in London, [[James Hamilton, 1st Viscount Claneboye|James Hamilton]], was involved in sending the letters to Scotland. Hamilton had kept a school in Dublin, and later James made him [[Viscount Claneboye|Viscount Clandeboye]].<ref>Mackie, vol.1 (1969), p.xvii, p.xxxvii: Birch, Thomas, ''Life of Prince Henry'', London/Dublin (1760), p.232</ref> James Hamilton was accredited by James VI to reside in London, by his letters to Elizabeth and Robert Cecil on 4 August 1600. James said that Hamilton would be a \"remaining agent\" the equivalent of [[George Nicholson (diplomat)|George Nicolson]] in Edinburgh.<ref>Mackie, J. D., ed., ''Calendar State Papers Scotland'', vol.13 part 2 (Scottish Record Office: Edinburgh, 1969), pp. 674-5</ref>\n\n[[File:1stEarlOfNorthampton.jpg|thumb|[[James VI of Scotland]] criticised [[Henry Howard, 1st Earl of Northampton|Henry Howard]]'s verbose writing style.]]\nThe English diplomat [[Henry Wotton]] later gave an anecdote that Elizabeth had once noticed mail arriving from Scotland. She demanded to see it, Cecil made to open the satchel (which Wotton calls a 'budget') but told the Queen it was filthy and smelled bad, and she could have the letters after they were aired.<ref>Bruce, John (1861), p.xxxix, citing Henry Wotton, ''Reliquiae Wottonianae'' (1672), p.169.</ref> It remains unclear if Elizabeth was actually unaware of any detail of Cecil's negotiations, as the historian [[Geoffrey Elton]] assumed.<ref>Alexander Courtney, 'The Secret Correspondence of James VI, 1601-3', in Susan Doran and Paulina Kewes, ''Doubtful and dangerous: The question of the succession in late Elizabethan England'' (Manchester, 2014), p. 139.</ref>\n\nHenry Wotton himself came to Scotland in September 1601 from Florence. Posing as an Italian called Octavio Baldi he met James and remained in character for three months. James discussed Wotton's arrival with Edward Bruce, his brother George, and the Earl of Mar. The English resident George Nicholson was unaware that the \"Italian\" was Wotton.<ref>''CSP. Scotland''., vol. 13 part 2 (HMSO: Edinburg, 1969), p. 876 no. 714</ref> Wotton later wrote that his mission was from [[Ferdinando I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Ferdinando de' Medici]] to advise James of a poison plot against him and bring a gift of antidotes.<ref>Henry Wotton, ''Reliquiae Wottonianae'', 2nd ed. (1654), pp. 29-35.</ref>\n\nSome of the letters, as was quite usual in diplomatic correspondence, employed numbers to refer to individuals, Robert Cecil was '10', James was '30', Howard '3' and Bruce '8.'<ref>See Bruce, John (1861), pp.15-32, for examples with these numbers.</ref> By June 1602, James wrote of how Cecil and his colleague '40' had \"so easily settled me in the only right course for my good, (and) so happily preserved the Queen's mind from the poison of jealous prejudice.\"<ref>Bruce, (1861), p. 15, modern spelling.</ref>\n\nDuring this time a separate 'public' correspondence between Elizabeth and James continued. The historian [[J. D. Mackie]] thought the tone of the public letters was now more cordial than in previous years.<ref>Mackie, vol.1 (1969), p.xvii.</ref> The irregular subsidy which Elizabeth paid to James (in cash or jewellery) was also increased.\n\nJames criticised Howard's writing style, writing in May 1602 comparing, \"my own laconic style\" with Howard's \"ample Asiatic and endless volumes\".<ref>Hailes (1766), p.116: Alexander Courtney, 'The Secret Correspondence of James VI, 1601-3', in Susan Doran and Paulina Kewes, ''Doubtful and dangerous: The question of the succession in late Elizabethan England'' (Manchester, 2014), p. 140.</ref> The 19th-century historian [[Patrick Fraser Tytler]] noted the excessive flattery used by Howard and the effort made to exclude others from the discussions. Although James did notice and challenge Howard's attempts to direct his actions with regard to other channels of communication, Tytler summed up their success;<blockquote>\"At all events, nothing could have been more secretly or adroitly managed than the whole correspondence between Howard, Cecil, and the Scottish king. No one had the least suspicion of the understanding that existed between the trio.\"<ref>Tytler, P.F., ''History of Scotland'', (1879), vol.4 chpt. 12, p. 307.</ref></blockquote>\nJ. D. Mackie noted amongst those unaware of the letters;  the English resident agent in Scotland George Nicholson, the [[Patrick Gray, 6th Lord Gray|Master of Grey]], an intriguer who served the [[Ludovic Stewart, 2nd Duke of Lennox|Duke of Lennox]], and James's own secretary [[James Elphinstone, 1st Lord Balmerino]].

Until the death of Elizabeth I two exchanges of letters between England and Scotland were kept up, the usual communication and the \"secret correspondence\".<ref>Bruce, John (1861), p.xxxv.</ref>\n\n==The letters==\nThe private letters to Scotland were written by Robert Cecil and [[Henry Howard, 1st Earl of Northampton|Henry Howard]]. James's letters were written by Mar, Kinloss, and perhaps Mar's kinsman, [[Thomas Erskine, 1st Earl of Kellie|Thomas Erskine of Gogar]].<ref>Alexander Courtney, 'The Secret Correspondence of James VI, 1601-3', in Susan Doran and Paulina Kewes, ''Doubtful and dangerous: The question of the succession in late Elizabethan England'' (Manchester, 2014), p. 139: For Thomas Erskine, see Hailes (1766), p. 97, 102, 111, 137, 209.</ref> Some of the letters were sent to England as if they were meant for the [[Henri, Duke of Rohan|Duke of Rohan]] in France, and so arrived in England to be added to the '[[diplomatic bag]]'. The 18th-century historian [[Thomas Birch]] suggested that a Scottish representative in London, [[James Hamilton, 1st Viscount Claneboye|James Hamilton]], was involved in sending the letters to Scotland. Hamilton had kept a school in Dublin, and later James made him [[Viscount Claneboye|Viscount Clandeboye]].<ref>Mackie, vol.1 (1969), p.xvii, p.xxxvii: Birch, Thomas, ''Life of Prince Henry'', London/Dublin (1760), p.232</ref> James Hamilton was accredited by James VI to reside in London, by his letters to Elizabeth and Robert Cecil on 4 August 1600. James said that Hamilton would be a \"remaining agent\" the equivalent of George Nicolson in Edinburgh.<ref>Mackie, J. D., ed., ''Calendar State Papers Scotland'', vol.13 part 2 (Scottish Record Office: Edinburgh, 1969), pp. 674-5</ref>\n\n[[File:1stEarlOfNorthampton.jpg|thumb|[[James VI of Scotland]] criticised [[Henry Howard, 1st Earl of Northampton|Henry Howard]]'s verbose writing style.]]\nThe English diplomat [[Henry Wotton]] later gave an anecdote that Elizabeth had once noticed mail arriving from Scotland. She demanded to see it, Cecil made to open the satchel (which Wotton calls a 'budget') but told the Queen it was filthy and smelled bad, and she could have the letters after they were aired.<ref>Bruce, John (1861), p.xxxix, citing Henry Wotton, ''Reliquiae Wottonianae'' (1672), p.169.</ref> It remains unclear if Elizabeth was actually unaware of any detail of Cecil's negotiations, as the historian [[Geoffrey Elton]] assumed.<ref>Alexander Courtney, 'The Secret Correspondence of James VI, 1601-3', in Susan Doran and Paulina Kewes, ''Doubtful and dangerous: The question of the succession in late Elizabethan England'' (Manchester, 2014), p. 139.</ref>\n\nHenry Wotton himself came to Scotland in September 1601 from Florence. Posing as an Italian called Octavio Baldi he met James and remained in character for three months. James discussed Wotton's arrival with Edward Bruce, his brother George, and the Earl of Mar. The English resident George Nicholson was unaware that the \"Italian\" was Wotton.<ref>''CSP. Scotland''., vol. 13 part 2 (HMSO: Edinburg, 1969), p. 876 no. 714</ref> Wotton later wrote that his mission was from [[Ferdinando I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Ferdinando de' Medici]] to advise James of a poison plot against him and bring a gift of antidotes.<ref>Henry Wotton, ''Reliquiae Wottonianae'', 2nd ed. (1654), pp. 29-35.</ref>\n\nSome of the letters, as was quite usual in diplomatic correspondence, employed numbers to refer to individuals, Robert Cecil was '10', James was '30', Howard '3' and Bruce '8.'<ref>See Bruce, John (1861), pp.15-32, for examples with these numbers.</ref> By June 1602, James wrote of how Cecil and his colleague '40' had \"so easily settled me in the only right course for my good, (and) so happily preserved the Queen's mind from the poison of jealous prejudice.\"<ref>Bruce, (1861), p. 15, modern spelling.</ref>\n\nDuring this time a separate 'public' correspondence between Elizabeth and James continued. The historian [[J. D. Mackie]] thought the tone of the public letters was now more cordial than in previous years.<ref>Mackie, vol.1 (1969), p.xvii.</ref> The irregular subsidy which Elizabeth paid to James (in cash or jewellery) was also increased.\n\nJames criticised Howard's writing style, writing in May 1602 comparing, \"my own laconic style\" with Howard's \"ample Asiatic and endless volumes\".<ref>Hailes (1766), p.116: Alexander Courtney, 'The Secret Correspondence of James VI, 1601-3', in Susan Doran and Paulina Kewes, ''Doubtful and dangerous: The question of the succession in late Elizabethan England'' (Manchester, 2014), p. 140.</ref> The 19th-century historian [[Patrick Fraser Tytler]] noted the excessive flattery used by Howard and the effort made to exclude others from the discussions. Although James did notice and challenge Howard's attempts to direct his actions with regard to other channels of communication, Tytler summed up their success;<blockquote>\"At all events, nothing could have been more secretly or adroitly managed than the whole correspondence between Howard, Cecil, and the Scottish king. No one had the least suspicion of the understanding that existed between the trio.\"<ref>Tytler, P.F., ''History of Scotland'', (1879), vol.4 chpt. 12, p. 307.</ref></blockquote>\nJ. D. Mackie noted amongst those unaware of the letters;  the English resident agent in Scotland George Nicholson, the [[Patrick Gray, 6th Lord Gray|Master of Grey]], an intriguer who served the [[Ludovic Stewart, 2nd Duke of Lennox|Duke of Lennox]], and James's own secretary [[James Elphinstone, 1st Lord Balmerino]].
