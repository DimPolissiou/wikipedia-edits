An early Dutch [[cookbook]] from 1514, ''Een notabel boecxken van cokeryen'' (\"A notable little cookery book\"),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kookhistorie.nl/NBC/index_nbc.htm |title=Home Notabel Boecxken van Cokeryen door Thomas vander Noot (1514) |publisher=Kookhistorie.nl |date=2002-08-13 |accessdate=2013-11-05}}</ref> documents a recipe for ''Appeltaerten'' (modern Dutch [[wikt:appeltaart|''Appeltaarten'']] 'apple pies'). This early recipe was simple, requiring only a standard pie crust, slices of especially soft apples with their skin and seeds removed, and ''den selven deeghe daer die taerte af ghemaect es'' (more of the same dough) on top. It was then baked in a typical [[Dutch oven]]. Once baked, the top crust (except at the edges) would be cut out from the middle, after which the apple slices were potentially put through a [[sieve]] before the pie was stirred with a wooden spoon. At this point the book recommends adding several [[spice]]s to the pie, namely: [[cardamom]], [[ginger]], [[cinnamon]], [[nutmeg]], [[clove]], [[Mace (spice)|mace]] and [[powdered sugar]]. Finally, after mixing the ingredients into the pie with [[cream]], it is once again put into the oven to dry.<ref>[http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/_not001nota01_01/_not001nota01_01_0003.php Een notabel boecxken van cokeryen - 123 Appeltaerten.], ''[http://dbnl.org dbnl.org]''</ref>\n\nTraditional [[Dutch cuisine|Dutch]] apple pie comes in two varieties, a crumb (''appelkruimeltaart'') and a lattice (''appeltaart'') style pie. Both recipes are distinct in that they typically call for flavourings of [[cinnamon]] and [[lemon juice]] to be added and differ in texture, not taste.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.recipestap.com/more-apple-cakes-hollandse-appeltaart-aka-dutch-apple-tart |title=Recipe: More apple cakes: Hollandse appeltaart aka Dutch Apple Tart |publisher=Recipes Tap |accessdate=2013-11-05 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012012659/http://www.recipestap.com/more-apple-cakes-hollandse-appeltaart-aka-dutch-apple-tart |archivedate=12 October 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.stemilt.com/stem-blog/dutch-apple-pie/|title=Dutch Apple Pie {{!}} Stemilt|date=2016-10-17|newspaper=Stemilt|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-15}}</ref> Dutch apple pies may include ingredients such as full-cream butter, raisins and [[almond paste]], in addition to ingredients such as apples and sugar, which they have in common with other recipes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kookhistorie.nl/images/vk-scan/vk-c3r.jpg |title=page 21 \"De verstandige kock of sorghvuldige huyshoudster (anno 1669)\"|accessdate=2013-11-05}}</ref>\n\nThe basis of Dutch apple pie is a crust on the bottom and around the edges. This crust is then filled with pieces or slices of apple, usually a crisp and mildly tart variety such as Goudreinet or [[Elstar]]. Cinnamon and [[sugar]] are generally mixed in with the apple filling. Atop the filling, strands of [[dough]] cover the pie in a [[Lattice (pastry)|lattice]] holding the filling in place but keeping it visible or cover the pie with crumbs. It can be eaten warm or cold, sometimes with a dash of whipped cream or vanilla ice cream. In the US, \"Dutch apple pie\" refers specifically to the apple pie style with a crumb, [[streusel]], topping.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.stemilt.com/stem-blog/dutch-apple-pie/|title=Dutch Apple Pie {{!}} Stemilt|date=2016-10-17|newspaper=Stemilt|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.browneyedbaker.com/2010/09/15/dutch-apple-pie/ |title=Dutch Apple Pie |publisher=Brown Eyed Baker|accessdate=2013-11-05}}</ref>\n\n==English style==\n\n[[File:For to Make Tartys in Applis (1381).gif|right|thumb|\"For to Make Tartys in Applis\", 18th-century print of a 14th-century recipe]]\nEnglish apple pie recipes go back to the time of [[Chaucer]]. The 1381 recipe (see illustration at right) is the earliest known apple pie recipe in the world,<ref name=\"smithsonian\"/> and lists the ingredients as ''good [[apple]]s, good [[spice]]s, [[ficus|fig]]s, [[raisin]]s and [[pear]]s.'' The ''cofyn'' of the recipe is a casing of pastry. [[Saffron]] is used for colouring the pie filling. Today, the English style incorporates generous layers of sweetened slices of, usually, Bramley apple; layered into a dome shape to allow for downward shrinkage, and thus avoid a saggy middle, then topped with butter or lard shortcrust pastry, and baked until the apple filling is cooked.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\nIn English-speaking countries, apple pie, often classified as a satisfying 'comfort' food, is a dessert of enduring popularity, whether it's eaten hot or cold, on its own or with [[ice cream]], [[cream|double cream]], or [[custard]].\n\n== French style ==\n\nOne kind of [[French cuisine|French]] style apple pie is very different compared to the typical version of the sweet dessert. Instead of it being right side up with crust on top and bottom, it actually is upside down, with the fruit being caramelised. This can be made not only with apples but other fruits or vegetables as well, for example, pears or tomatoes.\n''See [[Tarte Tatin]].''\n\nOthers use a more traditional presentation, including variants like the [[Norman Tart|Norman tart]].\n\n==Swedish style==\nThe [[Swedish cuisine|Swedish]] style apple pie is predominantly a variety of apple [[crumble]], rather than a traditional pastry pie. Often, breadcrumbs are used (wholly or partially) instead of flour, and sometimes rolled oats. It is usually flavoured with cinnamon and served with vanilla [[custard]] or ice cream. There is also a very popular version called ''\u00e4ppelkaka'' (apple cake), which differs from the pie in that it is a [[sponge cake]] baked with fresh apple pieces in it. \n{{Clear}}\n\n==In American culture==<!-- This section is linked from [[Cracker (food)]] -->\n{{see also|List of American foods}}\n[[File:Motherhood and apple pie.jpg|thumb|An apple pie is one of a number of American [[cultural icon]]s.]]\n\nApple pie was brought to the colonies by the [[English colonists|English]], the [[Dutch people|Dutch]], and the [[Swedes]] during the 17th and 18th centuries.

This early recipe was simple, requiring only a standard pie crust, slices of especially soft apples with their skin and seeds removed, and ''den selven deeghe daer die taerte af ghemaect es'' (more of the same dough) on top. It was then baked in a typical [[Dutch oven]]. Once baked, the top crust (except at the edges) would be cut out from the middle, after which the apple slices were potentially put through a [[sieve]] before the pie was stirred with a wooden spoon. At this point the book recommends adding several [[spice]]s to the pie, namely: [[cardamom]], [[ginger]], [[cinnamon]], [[nutmeg]], [[clove]], [[Mace (spice)|mace]] and [[powdered sugar]]. Finally, after mixing the ingredients into the pie with [[cream]], it is once again put into the oven to dry.<ref>[http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/_not001nota01_01/_not001nota01_01_0003.php Een notabel boecxken van cokeryen - 123 Appeltaerten.], ''[http://dbnl.org dbnl.org]''</ref>\n\nTraditional [[Dutch cuisine|Dutch]] apple pie comes in two varieties, a crumb (''appelkruimeltaart'') and a lattice (''appeltaart'') style pie. Both recipes are distinct in that they typically call for flavourings of [[cinnamon]] and [[lemon juice]] to be added and differ in texture, not taste.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.recipestap.com/more-apple-cakes-hollandse-appeltaart-aka-dutch-apple-tart |title=Recipe: More apple cakes: Hollandse appeltaart aka Dutch Apple Tart |publisher=Recipes Tap |accessdate=2013-11-05 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012012659/http://www.recipestap.com/more-apple-cakes-hollandse-appeltaart-aka-dutch-apple-tart |archivedate=12 October 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.stemilt.com/stem-blog/dutch-apple-pie/|title=Dutch Apple Pie {{!}} Stemilt|date=2016-10-17|newspaper=Stemilt|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-15}}</ref> Dutch apple pies may include ingredients such as full-cream butter, raisins and [[almond paste]], in addition to ingredients such as apples and sugar, which they have in common with other recipes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kookhistorie.nl/images/vk-scan/vk-c3r.jpg |title=page 21 \"De verstandige kock of sorghvuldige huyshoudster (anno 1669)\"|accessdate=2013-11-05}}</ref>\n\nThe basis of Dutch apple pie is a crust on the bottom and around the edges. This crust is then filled with pieces or slices of apple, usually a crisp and mildly tart variety such as Goudreinet or [[Elstar]]. Cinnamon and [[sugar]] are generally mixed in with the apple filling. Atop the filling, strands of [[dough]] cover the pie in a [[Lattice (pastry)|lattice]] holding the filling in place but keeping it visible or cover the pie with crumbs. It can be eaten warm or cold, sometimes with a dash of whipped cream or vanilla ice cream.

The 1381 recipe (see illustration at right) is the earliest known apple pie recipe in the world,<ref name=\"smithsonian\"/> and lists the ingredients as ''good [[apple]]s, good [[spice]]s, [[ficus|fig]]s, [[raisin]]s and [[pear]]s.'' The ''cofyn'' of the recipe is a casing of pastry. [[Saffron]] is used for colouring the pie filling. Today, the English style incorporates generous layers of sweetened slices of, usually, Bramley apple; layered into a dome shape to allow for downward shrinkage, and thus avoid a saggy middle, then topped with butter or lard shortcrust pastry, and baked until the apple filling is cooked.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\nIn English-speaking countries, apple pie, often classified as a satisfying 'comfort' food, is a dessert of enduring popularity, whether it's eaten hot or cold, on its own or with [[ice cream]], [[cream|double cream]], or [[custard]].\n\n== French style ==\n\nOne kind of [[French cuisine|French]] style apple pie is very different compared to the typical version of the sweet dessert. Instead of it being right side up with crust on top and bottom, it actually is upside down, with the fruit being caramelised. This can be made not only with apples but other fruits or vegetables as well, for example, pears or tomatoes.\n''See [[Tarte Tatin]].''\n\nOthers use a more traditional presentation, including variants like the [[Norman Tart|Norman tart]].\n\n==Swedish style==\nThe [[Swedish cuisine|Swedish]] style apple pie is predominantly a variety of apple [[crumble]], rather than a traditional pastry pie. Often, breadcrumbs are used (wholly or partially) instead of flour, and sometimes rolled oats. It is usually flavoured with cinnamon and served with vanilla [[custard]] or ice cream. There is also a very popular version called ''\u00e4ppelkaka'' (apple cake), which differs from the pie in that it is a [[sponge cake]] baked with fresh apple pieces in it. \n{{Clear}}\n\n==In American culture==<!-- This section is linked from [[Cracker (food)]] -->\n{{see also|List of American foods}}\n[[File:Motherhood and apple pie.jpg|thumb|An apple pie is one of a number of American [[cultural icon]]s.]]\n\nApple pie was brought to the colonies by the [[English colonists|English]], the [[Dutch people|Dutch]], and the [[Swedes]] during the 17th and 18th centuries.
