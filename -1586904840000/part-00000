''[[Human|Homo sapiens]]'' appear to have occupied all of Africa about 150,000 years ago, moved out of Africa 70,000 years ago, and had spread across [[Prehistory of Australia|Australia]], [[History of Asia|Asia]] and [[Paleolithic Europe|Europe]] by 40,000 years.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Early members of the genus ''[[Homo (genus)|Homo]]'', i.e. ''[[Homo ergaster]]'', ''Homo erectus'' and ''[[Homo heidelbergensis]]'', migrated from Africa during the [[Early Pleistocene]], possibly as a result of the operation of the [[Sahara Pump Theory|Saharan pump]], around 1.9 million years ago, and dispersed throughout most of the [[Old World]], reaching as far as [[Southeast Asia]]. Modern humans, ''[[Homo sapiens]]'', evolved in Africa up to 200,000 years ago and reached the [[Near East]] around [[70,000 BP|70 millennia ago]]. From the Near East, these populations spread east to [[Paleolithic South Asia|South Asia]] by 50 millennia ago.\n\nThe Indo-European migration had variously been dated to the end of the [[Neolithic]] ([[Marija Gimbutas]]: [[Corded ware]], [[Yamna culture|Yamna]], [[Kurgan]]), the early Neolithic ([[Colin Renfrew]]: [[Starcevo-K\u00f6r\u00f6s|Star\u010devo-K\u00f6r\u00f6s]], [[Linearbandkeramic]]) and the late [[Palaeolithic]] ([[Marcel Otte]], [[Paleolithic Continuity Theory]]).\n\nThe speakers of the [[Proto-Indo-European language]] are usually believed to have originated to the north of the [[Black Sea]] (today Eastern [[Ukraine]] and Southern Russia), and from there they gradually migrated into, and spread their language by cultural diffusion to, [[Anatolia]], Europe, and Central Asia, [[Iran]] and South Asia starting from around the end of the Neolithic period (see [[Kurgan hypothesis]]).\n\n== Through China ==\n[[Image:Southeast asia.jpg|thumb|150px|Southeast Asia Map]]\nTaiwan is the [[urheimat]] of the Austronesian languages. Archaeological evidence (e.g., {{Harvcolnb |Bellwood|1997}}) suggests that speakers of pre-Proto-Austronesian spread from the South Chinese mainland to Taiwan at some time around 8,000 years ago. Evidence from historical linguistics suggests that it is from this island that seafaring peoples migrated, perhaps in distinct waves separated by millennia, to the entire region encompassed by the Austronesian languages {{Harvcol |Diamond|2000}}.

Some historians believe that those ethnic minorities first came to settle north of the Yellow river (Huang He) round about 2515 BC. The Chinese annals also mentioned about their presence in the middle basin of the Yellow River in 850 BC. But new emigrants coming from Central Asia later impelled those ethnic groups to move southwards to new fertile areas between the Yellow and Yangtze (Chang Jiang) rivers and then migrated down through the present day Yunnan and descended further down into Burma.\n\n[[Sixteen Kingdoms|Sixteen kingdoms]] were a plethora of short-lived non-Chinese dynasties that came to rule the whole or parts of northern China in the 4th and 5th centuries. Many ethnic groups were involved, including ancestors of the [[Turkic people|Turks]], [[Mongols|Mongolians]], and [[Tibetans]].\n\nChinese history is that of a dynasty alternating between periods of political unity and disunity and occasionally becoming dominated by foreign Asian peoples, most of whom were assimilated into the [[Han Chinese]] population. Cultural and political influences from many parts of Asia, carried by successive waves of [[immigration]], expansion, and [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]], merged to create modern [[Culture of China|Chinese culture]].\n\n'''The [[History of Yunnan]]''' is related to Burma, can date back to [[Yuanmou Man]], a ''[[Homo erectus]]'' fossil, the oldest known hominid fossil in China. By the Neolithic period, there were human settlements in the area of Lake Dian. These people used stone tools and constructed simple wooden structures. Yunnan's location in the southwesternmost corner of China and its peoples have the strong ethnic identities are due to cultural and political influences from Burma. In 109 BC, [[Emperor Wu of Han China|Emperor Wu]] sent General Guo Chang (\u90ed\u660c) south to Yunnan, establishing Yizhou commandery and 24 subordinate counties. The commandery seat was at Dianchi county (present day Jinning \u664b\u5b81). Another county was called \"Yunnan\", probably the first use of the name. To expand the burgeoning trade with Burma and [[Greater India|India]]. Anthropologists have determined that these people were related to the people now known as the [[Tai peoples|Tai]]. They lived in tribal congregations, sometimes led by exile Chinese. In the ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'', [[Zhang Qian]] (died 113 BC) and [[Sima Qian]] (145-90 BC) make references to \"Shendu\", which may have been referring to the [[Indus River|Indus Valley]] (the [[Sindh]] province in modern Pakistan), originally known as \"Sindhu\" in [[Sanskrit]]. When [[Yunnan]] was annexed by the [[Han Dynasty]], Chinese authorities also reported a Shendu\" (Indian) community living in the area.<ref>Tan Chung (1998).

The Tagaung dynasty is explicitly incorporated into the story of Duttabaung's mother and father; the lineage of the Queen of Beikthano is less consistent, but always intertwined with that of the Sri Kestra village rulers. In all of these, links are made between territorial control, royal patronage of Hindu or Buddhist sects and supernatural events.<ref name=\"D. G . E.

Roman envoys from [[Alexandria]] also passed through the Irrawaddy valley in 79 CE en route to China. 2nd century Burmese sea-farers, trading with Southern India across the [[Bay of Bengal]], are thought to have brought Buddhism to Burma in the 2nd century CE. and by the 4th century, much of the Irrawaddy Valley was Buddhist including the then dominant city-state, Prome (modern [[Pyay]]).<ref name=\"footsteps\"/>\n'''[[History of Mizoram|Mizos]]''' were part of a great wave of migration from China and later moved out to India to their present habitat. It is possible that the Mizos came from [[Sinlung]] or Chhinlungsan located on the banks of the Yalung River in China, first settled in the [[Shan State]] and moved on to the [[Kabaw Valley]].\nThe [[Nagaland|Naga]] were originally referred to as ''Naka'' in Burmese languages, which means 'people with pierced ears'. The Naga tribes had socio-economic and political links with tribes in [[Assam]] and Burma (Myanmar); even today a large population of Naga inhabits Assam. Following an invasion in 1816, the area, along with Assam, came under direct rule of Burma up to the time [[British East India Company]] took control of Assam in 1826 following the Treaty of Yandaboo of 1826. The '''history of Assam''' is the history of a confluence of peoples from the east, west and the north; the confluence of the [[Indo-Aryans|Indo-Aryan]], [[Austro-Asiatic]] and [[Tibeto-Burman]] cultures. The Late neolithic cultures have affinities with the spread of the [[Mon Khmer]] speaking people from [[Malaysia]] and the [[Ayeyarwady River|Ayeyarwady]] valley and late neolithic developments in [[Northern and southern China|South China]].  Since these cultures have been dated to 4500-4000 BCE, the Assam sites are dated to approximately that period.\n\n== Earliest migrants amongst Burmese ==\n\n[[Image:Transasia trade routes 1stC CE gr2.png|thumb|Trans-Asian trade routes, 1st century CE]]Mons or Talaings, an Ethnic Minority Group of Burma, migrated from the Talingana State, Telangana region of Southern India.

Wiesbaden.</ref> The Mon probably began migrating down from China into the area in about 3000 BC.<ref>Dr Than Tun, ''History of Burma in pictures''</ref>\n\nThose Mon (Talaings) brought with them the culture, arts, literature, religion and all the skills of civilisation of present Burma. They founded the Thaton and Bago (Pegu) Kingdoms.  King [[Anawrahta]] (whose Sanskrit name was Aniruddha) of Bagan (Pagan) conquered that Mon Kingdom of King [[Manuha]], named Suvannabumi (The Land of Golden Hues).<ref>H G E Hall ''History of Southeast Asia''</ref>\nThe conquest of Thaton in 1057 was a decisive event in Burmese history. It brought the Burman into direct contact with the Indian civilizing influences in the south and opened the way for intercourse with Buddhist centres overseas, especially Sri Lanka.<ref>D. G . E.

Page 16</ref> Those Bagan Burmese people of central Burma had [[Theravada Buddhism]] spreading from Mons. In the next decade, Burmese or Myanmar language was gradually derived from [[Sanskrit]], [[Pali]], [[Pyu]] and [[Mon language|Mon]] languages.\n\nThe evidence of the inscriptions, Luce<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Luce | first1 = G. H. | year = | title = Burma's Debt to Pagan | url = | journal = Journal of the Burma Research Society | volume = XXII | issue = | page = 121 }}</ref> warns us, shows that the Buddhism of Pagan \u2018was mixed up with Hindu Brahmanic cults, Vaisnavism in particular.<ref>BURMA, D. G 1960. Page 16</ref>\n\nWhile little is known about the early people of Burma, the Mon were the first of the modern ethnic groups to migrate into the region, starting around 1500 BCE. Oral tradition suggests that they had contact with Buddhism via seafaring as early as the 3rd century BCE, though definitely by the 2nd century BCE when they received an envoy of monks from [[Ashoka]].  Much of the Mon's written records have been destroyed through wars.  The Mons blended Indian and Mon cultures together in a hybrid of the two civilisations.  By the mid-9th century, they had come to dominate all of southern Burma.\n\n== Forefathers of Bamars ==\n\nThe Burmese language is a [[Tibeto-Burman]] language and closely related to the [[Yi language]] or [[Nuosu language|Nuosu]], which is today spoken mainly in [[Yunnan]] but also in parts of [[Sichuan]] and [[Guizhou]] provinces in China.  Until a thousand years ago, [[Tibeto-Burman languages|Tibeto-Burman]] and more specifically Burmese-Yi speaking peoples were much more widespread, across Yunnan and Guizhou and southern Sichuan as well as northern Burma.  During the Han dynasty in China, Yunnan was ruled primarily by the Burmese-Yi speaking [[Dian Kingdom|Dian]] and [[Yelang]] kingdoms.  During the [[Tang dynasty]] in China, Yunnan as well as northern Burma was ruled by the Burmese-Yi speaking [[Kingdom of Nanzhao|Nanzhao]] kingdom (until the 1960s mistakenly thought to be Tai-speaking).  It was during this Burmese-Yi Nanzhao domination of northern Burma that the first Burmese-Yi speakers probably entered the Irrawaddy valley in large numbers, and established the outpost of Pagan or Bagan.  The naming system of the earliest Bagan kings is identical to the naming system of the Nanzhao kings.  Sculptures found in Halin to the north are almost identical to Nanzhao sculptures.  The Tanguts of Xixia (to the north of Yunnan around this time) spoke a Tibeto-Burman language that may also have been close to Burmese-Yi.  Going further back in time, the people of the ancient kingdom of [[Sanxingdui]] in Sichuan (in the 12th\u201311th centuries BCE) were probably ancestral to the later Tibet-Burmans and perhaps even more narrowly to the ancestors of the Burmese-Yi speakers at Dian and Yelang.\n\n== Geography that facilitated the migration of Tibeto-Burman, Shans and Mons ==\n[[Image:China topo.png|thumb|Topographical map covering southwestern China]]\n[[Image:ChinaGeography.png|thumb]]\nNumerous ethnic Burmese peoples had migrated from [[Yunnan]], which is situated in southwest China, bounded on the north by Sichuan and Sizang (Sikang), on the east by Guizhou and Guangxi, on the south by Vietnam and Burma, and on the west by Burma and Assam. It is extremely mountainous with only a limited area of level plains.\n\nIt is furrowed by the Taiping, Shweli, Salween, Mekong, Black and Red rivers.\n\nThe Salween and the Mekong are rivers of great length, having their sources in the interior part of Tibet, and flowing through Yunnan and the neighboring lands of Burma, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam.\n\nThe basins of these rivers and their tributaries form deep, narrow valleys which, with the high parallel mountain ranges running generally north and south, constitute a favourable home for numerous ethnic minorities.\nYunnan shares a long common border with Burma and many ethnic groups that live in Yunnan can also be found in Burma.\n\nBurma is like a big super-highway between India and China.<ref name=\"Bagan Culture' page 42\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> India and China are the world's biggest and ancient cradles of civilization. High, snow peaked, rough and steep Himalaya mountain ranges block the direct interaction or travelling between the two of them except for the virtual highway through Burma.

Phayre, History of Burma London, 1883, pp. 293-304.</ref>\n\nWesali or Vaisali was founded by Hindu Chandra Dynasty. \"The area known as North Arakan had been for many years before the 8th century the seat of Hindu dynasties. In 788 AD a new dynasty, known as the Chandras, founded the city of Wesali. This city became a noted trade port to which as many as a thousand ships came annually; the Chandra kings were upholders of Buddhism, ... their territory extended as far north as Chittagong;---- Wesali was an easterly Hindu kingdom of Bengal --- Both government and people were Indian.<ref>M.S. Collis, \"Arakan's place in the civilization of the Bay\", ''Journal of the Burma Research Society'', 50th Anniversary publications No.2, Rangoon, 1960, P. 486.</ref> So far as Arakan is concerned, the inscriptions show traces of two early dynasties holding sway in the north. The earlier one, a Candra dynasty, seems to have been founded in the middle of the 4th century AD. Its capital was known by the Indian name of Vaisali and it maintained close connections with India. Thirteen kings of this dynasty are said to have reigned for a total period of 230 years. The second dynasty was founded in the 8th century by a ruler referred to as Sri Dharmavijaya, who was of pure Kshatriya descent. His grandson married a daughter of the Pyu king of Sri Ksetra.<ref>BURMA, D. G . E.

Although the Chandras usually held Buddhistic doctrines, there is reason to believe that Brahmanism and Buddhism flourished side by side in the capital.\n\n\"The Burmese do not seem to have settled in Arakan until possibly as late as the tenth century AD. Hence earlier dynasties are thought to have been Indian, ruling over a population similar to that of Bengal.  All the capitals known to history have been in the north near modern Akyab\".<ref>D. G.

''[[Human|Homo sapiens]]'' appear to have occupied all of Africa about 150,000 years ago, moved out of Africa 70,000 years ago, and had spread across [[Prehistory of Australia|Australia]], [[History of Asia|Asia]] and [[Paleolithic Europe|Europe]] by 40,000 years.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Early members of the genus ''[[Homo (genus)|Homo]]'', i.e. ''[[Homo ergaster]]'', ''Homo erectus'' and ''[[Homo heidelbergensis]]'', migrated from Africa during the [[Early Pleistocene]], possibly as a result of the operation of the [[Sahara Pump Theory|Saharan pump]], around 1.9 million years ago, and dispersed throughout most of the [[Old World]], reaching as far as [[Southeast Asia]]. Modern humans, ''[[Homo sapiens]]'', evolved in Africa up to 200,000 years ago and reached the [[Near East]] around [[70,000 BP|70 millennia ago]]. From the Near East, these populations spread east to [[Paleolithic South Asia|South Asia]] by 50 millennia ago.\n\nThe Indo-European migration had variously been dated to the end of the [[Neolithic]] ([[Marija Gimbutas]]: [[Corded ware]], [[Yamna culture|Yamna]], [[Kurgan]]), the early Neolithic ([[Colin Renfrew]]: [[Starcevo-K\u00f6r\u00f6s|Star\u010devo-K\u00f6r\u00f6s]], [[Linearbandkeramic]]) and the late [[Palaeolithic]] ([[Marcel Otte]], [[Paleolithic Continuity Theory]]).\n\nThe speakers of the [[Proto-Indo-European language]] are usually believed to have originated to the north of the [[Black Sea]] (today Eastern [[Ukraine]] and Southern Russia), and from there they gradually migrated into, and spread their language by cultural diffusion to, [[Anatolia]], Europe, and Central Asia, [[Iran]] and South Asia starting from around the end of the Neolithic period (see [[Kurgan hypothesis]]).\n\n== Through China ==\n[[Image:Southeast asia.jpg|thumb|150px|Southeast Asia Map]]\nTaiwan is the [[urheimat]] of the Austronesian languages. Archaeological evidence (e.g., {{Harvcolnb |Bellwood|1997}}) suggests that speakers of pre-Proto-Austronesian spread from the South Chinese mainland to Taiwan at some time around 8,000 years ago. Evidence from historical linguistics suggests that it is from this island that seafaring peoples migrated, perhaps in distinct waves separated by millennia, to the entire region encompassed by the Austronesian languages {{Harvcol |Diamond|2000}}.

Some historians believe that those ethnic minorities first came to settle north of the Yellow river (Huang He) round about 2515 BC. The Chinese annals also mentioned about their presence in the middle basin of the Yellow River in 850 BC. But new emigrants coming from Central Asia later impelled those ethnic groups to move southwards to new fertile areas between the Yellow and Yangtze (Chang Jiang) rivers and then migrated down through the present day Yunnan and descended further down into Burma.\n\n[[Sixteen Kingdoms|Sixteen kingdoms]] were a plethora of short-lived non-Chinese dynasties that came to rule the whole or parts of northern China in the 4th and 5th centuries. Many ethnic groups were involved, including ancestors of the [[Turkic people|Turks]], [[Mongols|Mongolians]], and [[Tibetans]].\n\nChinese history is that of a dynasty alternating between periods of political unity and disunity and occasionally becoming dominated by foreign Asian peoples, most of whom were assimilated into the [[Han Chinese]] population. Cultural and political influences from many parts of Asia, carried by successive waves of [[immigration]], expansion, and [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]], merged to create modern [[Culture of China|Chinese culture]].\n\n'''The [[History of Yunnan]]''' is related to Burma, can date back to [[Yuanmou Man]], a ''[[Homo erectus]]'' fossil, the oldest known hominid fossil in China. By the Neolithic period, there were human settlements in the area of Lake Dian. These people used stone tools and constructed simple wooden structures. Yunnan's location in the southwesternmost corner of China and its peoples have the strong ethnic identities are due to cultural and political influences from Burma. In 109 BC, [[Emperor Wu of Han China|Emperor Wu]] sent General Guo Chang (\u90ed\u660c) south to Yunnan, establishing Yizhou commandery and 24 subordinate counties. The commandery seat was at Dianchi county (present day Jinning \u664b\u5b81). Another county was called \"Yunnan\", probably the first use of the name. To expand the burgeoning trade with Burma and [[Greater India|India]]. Anthropologists have determined that these people were related to the people now known as the [[Tai peoples|Tai]]. They lived in tribal congregations, sometimes led by exile Chinese. In the ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'', [[Zhang Qian]] (died 113 BC) and [[Sima Qian]] (145-90 BC) make references to \"Shendu\", which may have been referring to the [[Indus River|Indus Valley]] (the [[Sindh]] province in modern Pakistan), originally known as \"Sindhu\" in [[Sanskrit]].

HALL, BURMA</ref>\n\nAccording to Burmese mythology, [[Abhiraja]], who had been a king from a janapada and lost in war, left India and migrated to Ayarwaddy river, founding the [[Tagaung]] dynasty. The events from the myths refer to the time around 1000-600 BC. The Tagaung dynasty is explicitly incorporated into the story of Duttabaung's mother and father; the lineage of the Queen of Beikthano is less consistent, but always intertwined with that of the Sri Kestra village rulers. In all of these, links are made between territorial control, royal patronage of Hindu or Buddhist sects and supernatural events.<ref name=\"D. G . E. HALL, BURMA\"/>\n\nLittle is known about life in early Burma but there is evidence that land and sea traders from China and India<ref name=\"Bagan Culture' page 42\">''Bagan Culture'' page 42, Professor U Than Tun M.A., B.L., D. Lit., Ph.D.</ref><ref name=\"ReferenceA\">''Ancient Pyu'' page 3&4 Professor U Than Tun M.A., B.L., D. Lit., Ph.D.</ref> passed by and left their mark on the region and the local people traded [[ivory]], [[Gemstone|precious stones]], [[gold]] and [[silver]], [[Rhinoceros horn#Rhinoceros horns|rhinoceros horns]], and horses with these traders. Roman envoys from [[Alexandria]] also passed through the Irrawaddy valley in 79 CE en route to China. 2nd century Burmese sea-farers, trading with Southern India across the [[Bay of Bengal]], are thought to have brought Buddhism to Burma in the 2nd century CE. and by the 4th century, much of the Irrawaddy Valley was Buddhist including the then dominant city-state, Prome (modern [[Pyay]]).<ref name=\"footsteps\"/>\n'''[[History of Mizoram|Mizos]]''' were part of a great wave of migration from China and later moved out to India to their present habitat. It is possible that the Mizos came from [[Sinlung]] or Chhinlungsan located on the banks of the Yalung River in China, first settled in the [[Shan State]] and moved on to the [[Kabaw Valley]].\nThe [[Nagaland|Naga]] were originally referred to as ''Naka'' in Burmese languages, which means 'people with pierced ears'. The Naga tribes had socio-economic and political links with tribes in [[Assam]] and Burma (Myanmar); even today a large population of Naga inhabits Assam. Following an invasion in 1816, the area, along with Assam, came under direct rule of Burma up to the time [[British East India Company]] took control of Assam in 1826 following the Treaty of Yandaboo of 1826. The '''history of Assam''' is the history of a confluence of peoples from the east, west and the north; the confluence of the [[Indo-Aryans|Indo-Aryan]], [[Austro-Asiatic]] and [[Tibeto-Burman]] cultures. The Late neolithic cultures have affinities with the spread of the [[Mon Khmer]] speaking people from [[Malaysia]] and the [[Ayeyarwady River|Ayeyarwady]] valley and late neolithic developments in [[Northern and southern China|South China]].  Since these cultures have been dated to 4500-4000 BCE, the Assam sites are dated to approximately that period.\n\n== Earliest migrants amongst Burmese ==\n\n[[Image:Transasia trade routes 1stC CE gr2.png|thumb|Trans-Asian trade routes, 1st century CE]]Mons or Talaings, an Ethnic Minority Group of Burma, migrated from the Talingana State, Telangana region of Southern India. They mixed with the new migrants of Mongol from China and driven out the above Andhra and Orissa colonists.<ref>''The Muslims of Burma: A study of a minority Group'', by Moshe Yegar, 1972, Otto Harrassowitz. Wiesbaden.</ref> The Mon probably began migrating down from China into the area in about 3000 BC.<ref>Dr Than Tun, ''History of Burma in pictures''</ref>\n\nThose Mon (Talaings) brought with them the culture, arts, literature, religion and all the skills of civilisation of present Burma. They founded the Thaton and Bago (Pegu) Kingdoms.  King [[Anawrahta]] (whose Sanskrit name was Aniruddha) of Bagan (Pagan) conquered that Mon Kingdom of King [[Manuha]], named Suvannabumi (The Land of Golden Hues).<ref>H G E Hall ''History of Southeast Asia''</ref>\nThe conquest of Thaton in 1057 was a decisive event in Burmese history. It brought the Burman into direct contact with the Indian civilizing influences in the south and opened the way for intercourse with Buddhist centres overseas, especially Sri Lanka.<ref>D. G . E. HALL, M.A., D.LIT., F.R.HIST.S.Professor Emeritus of the University of London and formerly professor of history in the University of Rangoon, Burma. Third edition 1960. Page 16</ref> Those Bagan Burmese people of central Burma had [[Theravada Buddhism]] spreading from Mons. In the next decade, Burmese or Myanmar language was gradually derived from [[Sanskrit]], [[Pali]], [[Pyu]] and [[Mon language|Mon]] languages.\n\nThe evidence of the inscriptions, Luce<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Luce | first1 = G. H. | year = | title = Burma's Debt to Pagan | url = | journal = Journal of the Burma Research Society | volume = XXII | issue = | page = 121 }}</ref> warns us, shows that the Buddhism of Pagan \u2018was mixed up with Hindu Brahmanic cults, Vaisnavism in particular.<ref>BURMA, D. G 1960. Page 16</ref>\n\nWhile little is known about the early people of Burma, the Mon were the first of the modern ethnic groups to migrate into the region, starting around 1500 BCE. Oral tradition suggests that they had contact with Buddhism via seafaring as early as the 3rd century BCE, though definitely by the 2nd century BCE when they received an envoy of monks from [[Ashoka]].  Much of the Mon's written records have been destroyed through wars.  The Mons blended Indian and Mon cultures together in a hybrid of the two civilisations.  By the mid-9th century, they had come to dominate all of southern Burma.\n\n== Forefathers of Bamars ==\n\nThe Burmese language is a [[Tibeto-Burman]] language and closely related to the [[Yi language]] or [[Nuosu language|Nuosu]], which is today spoken mainly in [[Yunnan]] but also in parts of [[Sichuan]] and [[Guizhou]] provinces in China.  Until a thousand years ago, [[Tibeto-Burman languages|Tibeto-Burman]] and more specifically [[Yi languages|Burmese-Yi]] speaking peoples were much more widespread, across Yunnan and Guizhou and southern Sichuan as well as northern Burma.  During the Han dynasty in China, Yunnan was ruled primarily by the Burmese-Yi speaking [[Dian Kingdom|Dian]] and [[Yelang]] kingdoms.  During the [[Tang dynasty]] in China, Yunnan as well as northern Burma was ruled by the Burmese-Yi speaking [[Kingdom of Nanzhao|Nanzhao]] kingdom (until the 1960s mistakenly thought to be Tai-speaking).  It was during this Burmese-Yi Nanzhao domination of northern Burma that the first Burmese-Yi speakers probably entered the Irrawaddy valley in large numbers, and established the outpost of Pagan or Bagan.  The naming system of the earliest Bagan kings is identical to the naming system of the Nanzhao kings.  Sculptures found in Halin to the north are almost identical to Nanzhao sculptures.  The Tanguts of Xixia (to the north of Yunnan around this time) spoke a Tibeto-Burman language that may also have been close to Burmese-Yi.  Going further back in time, the people of the ancient kingdom of [[Sanxingdui]] in Sichuan (in the 12th\u201311th centuries BCE) were probably ancestral to the later Tibet-Burmans and perhaps even more narrowly to the ancestors of the Burmese-Yi speakers at Dian and Yelang.\n\n== Geography that facilitated the migration of Tibeto-Burman, Shans and Mons ==\n[[Image:China topo.png|thumb|Topographical map covering southwestern China]]\n[[Image:ChinaGeography.png|thumb]]\nNumerous ethnic Burmese peoples had migrated from [[Yunnan]], which is situated in southwest China, bounded on the north by Sichuan and Sizang (Sikang), on the east by Guizhou and Guangxi, on the south by Vietnam and Burma, and on the west by Burma and Assam. It is extremely mountainous with only a limited area of level plains.\n\nIt is furrowed by the Taiping, Shweli, Salween, Mekong, Black and Red rivers.\n\nThe Salween and the Mekong are rivers of great length, having their sources in the interior part of Tibet, and flowing through Yunnan and the neighboring lands of Burma, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam.\n\nThe basins of these rivers and their tributaries form deep, narrow valleys which, with the high parallel mountain ranges running generally north and south, constitute a favourable home for numerous ethnic minorities.\nYunnan shares a long common border with Burma and many ethnic groups that live in Yunnan can also be found in Burma.\n\nBurma is like a big super-highway between India and China.<ref name=\"Bagan Culture' page 42\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> India and China are the world's biggest and ancient cradles of civilization. High, snow peaked, rough and steep Himalaya mountain ranges block the direct interaction or travelling between the two of them except for the virtual highway through Burma. So there were a lot of travelers, migrants, victims of disasters and famine, war refugees etc. moving along this Burma Highway and some of them settled in Burma.\n\n== Indian and Burmese settlement in Arakan ==\n\nThe Arakanese chronicles claim that the Kingdom was founded in 2666 BC.<ref>A.P. Phayre, History of Burma London, 1883, pp. 293-304.</ref>\n\nWesali or Vaisali was founded by Hindu Chandra Dynasty. \"The area known as North Arakan had been for many years before the 8th century the seat of Hindu dynasties. In 788 AD a new dynasty, known as the Chandras, founded the city of Wesali. This city became a noted trade port to which as many as a thousand ships came annually; the Chandra kings were upholders of Buddhism, ... their territory extended as far north as Chittagong;---- Wesali was an easterly Hindu kingdom of Bengal --- Both government and people were Indian.<ref>M.S. Collis, \"Arakan's place in the civilization of the Bay\", ''Journal of the Burma Research Society'', 50th Anniversary publications No.2, Rangoon, 1960, P. 486.</ref> So far as Arakan is concerned, the inscriptions show traces of two early dynasties holding sway in the north. The earlier one, a Candra dynasty, seems to have been founded in the middle of the 4th century AD. Its capital was known by the Indian name of Vaisali and it maintained close connections with India. Thirteen kings of this dynasty are said to have reigned for a total period of 230 years. The second dynasty was founded in the 8th century by a ruler referred to as Sri Dharmavijaya, who was of pure Kshatriya descent. His grandson married a daughter of the Pyu king of Sri Ksetra.<ref>BURMA, D. G . E. HALL, M.A., D.LIT., F.R.HIST.S.Professor Emeritus of the University of London and formerly professor of history in the University of Rangoon, Burma. Third edition 1960. Page 8-9</ref>\n\nHindu statues and inscriptions were found in Wesali. The ruins of old capital of Arakan - Wesali show Hindu statues and inscriptions of the 8th century. Although the Chandras usually held Buddhistic doctrines, there is reason to believe that Brahmanism and Buddhism flourished side by side in the capital.\n\n\"The Burmese do not seem to have settled in Arakan until possibly as late as the tenth century AD. Hence earlier dynasties are thought to have been Indian, ruling over a population similar to that of Bengal.  All the capitals known to history have been in the north near modern Akyab\".<ref>D. G. E Hall, ''A History of South East Asia'', New York, 1968, P. 389.</ref>\n\n== Salones (Moken) and Pashus (Malays) ==\n\nIn the southernmost part of Burma, the Salones (Moken) and Pashus (Malays) migrated into Burma from the south and sea since prehistoric time.\nThe [[Burmese language|Burmese]] call the Moken '''Selung''', '''Salone''', or '''Chalome'''.<ref>Anderson, John (1890) ''The Selungs of the Mergui Archipelago'' Tr\u00fcbner & Co., London, pp. 1-5</ref> In [[Thailand]] they are called '''Chao Ley''' (people of the sea) or '''Chao nam''' (people of the water), although these terms are also used loosely to include the [[Urak Lawoi]] and even the [[Orang Laut]]. In Thailand, acculturated Moken are called Thai Mai (new Thais).\n\nThe [[Moken]] are also called [[Moken|Sea Gypsies]], a generic term that applies to a number of peoples in southeast Asia.  The Urak Lawoi are sometimes classified with the Moken, but they are linguistically and ethnologically distinct, being much more closely related to the Malay people.<ref>[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=urk Classification of Urak Lawoi language]</ref><ref>{{citation|url=http://www.iucn.org/themes/ceesp/WAMIP/Urak%20Lawoi%20pamphlet.doc|title=Urak Lawoi of the Adang Archipelago, Tarutao National Marine Park, Satun Province, Thailand|author=Dr. Supin Wongbusarakum|date=December 2005|format=DOC}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\nThey refer to themselves as Moken.

Various fields of practice and industry have their own specialized vocabularies, or jargon, that allow those educated within that industry to concisely convey ideas that may be confusing, misleading, or nonsensical to an outside listener.<ref name=\"CB\">{{cite web|url=http://www.criminalbrief.com/?p=10866|  title=Buzzwords\u2013 bang * splat !| last=Lundin|first=Leigh| date=2009-12-31| publisher=Criminal Brief |work=Don Martin School of Software}}</ref> The difference between technobabble and jargon lies with the intent of the user and the audience: a dishonest person might use overly technical (and often meaningless) language to overwhelm and confuse the audience, masking their dishonesty, while a fiction writer might use it to cover [[plot hole]]s or to invoke [[suspension of disbelief]] of story elements that defy current understandings of science and technology. Use of jargon within technical circles and with no intent to [[wiktionary:obfuscate|obfuscate]] is not usually included in the definition of technobabble.<ref name=\"CB\" />\n\n== Common uses ==\nAuthors and others who wish to convey a feeling of technical sophistication may write or talk in technobabble. They may use jargon without considering what it actually means to give an impression that they know things that their readers or listeners do not. However, if the jargon is decoded, it becomes apparent that the originator does not really understand what has been said or is deliberately being unclear. When used in this way, technobabble is considered pretentious and often unacceptable. If done carelessly, even novice listeners can often detect subtle signs of dishonesty and insincerity.\n\nTechnobabble's principal use in most science fiction, in particular more [[hard science fiction]], is to conceal the true (impossible) nature of materials, technologies, or devices mentioned in the story, often because of a violation of the laws of [[physics]] as currently understood. As reality and somewhat serious projections about the future are important in hard sci-fi, technobabble can give the impression of new discoveries rendering our current understanding of how the universe works \"wrong\". For example, despite the implications of the [[Special Theory of Relativity]] on [[faster than light]] travel, it ''can'' be done via [[wormhole]]s\u2014technobabble provides an \"enabling device\" to provide the impression that this current understanding was \"limited\" or \"flawed\" without actually having to explain how or why.\n\nTechnobabble also occurs in [[soft science fiction]], although here it is frequently just a throw-away part of the world and not dwelt on. Soft sci-fi generally prefers [[unobtainium]] or [[handwavium]] to technobabble, as it is less taxing on the reader and fits with the setting of telling a story in a sci-fi setting as opposed to telling a story about partially fictional science.\n\n=== Forms ===\nThere are several forms of technobabble. One form, mostly used in fiction, depends on jargon and story features that are specific to or even exclusive to the story's universe. Stringing together a series of these elements to explain a problem or solution allows the author to easily craft a situation without having to depend on real-world laws to correlate to or confirm it. For example, the time travel device in the 1985 comedy drama film ''[[Back to the Future]]'' was said to be powered by a \"flux capacitor\", which has no meaning outside the context of the movie. A specialised form of technobabble known as ''treknobabble'' (and listed in scripts simply as '[TECH]') was devised for the various long-running ''[[Star Trek]]'' television programs and movies, which relied upon quasi-scientific [[Deus ex machina|solutions to dramatic problems]]. Other [[science fiction]] movies and literature have their own form of technobabble. This is often because the concepts and items being talked about are fictional, but necessary for the story.\n\nA second form of technobabble comes from the practice of taking an otherwise simple concept and describing it in a scientifically overworked manner to mask its inherent simplicity (see: ''[https://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A640207 Sesquipedalian Obscurantism])''. One well-known example is the [[dihydrogen monoxide hoax]], describing the supposedly dangerous characteristics of ordinary [[water]] by labelling the substance with its esoteric chemical name.\n\nSome forms of technobabble have the goal of intentionally convincing the reader that the science explained is true even though it may not be. One such example is [[Alan Sokal]]'s \"[[Sokal Affair|Transgressing the Boundaries: Towards a Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity]]\" (1996), in which Sokal submitted a seemingly real, but nonsensical, paper to the Journal ''[[Social Text]]'' in order to show that a supposedly serious journal in postmodern theory would accept a meaningless paper if it used sufficiently impenetrable language.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Bogdanov affair]]\n* [[Neologism]]\n* [[Officialese]]\n* [[Rubber science]]\n* [[Sokal affair]]\n* [[Turboencabulator]]\n* [[Flux capacitor]]\n* [[Fedspeak]]\n* [[Psychobabble]]\n* [[Bullshit]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Wiktionary}}\n* [http://www.newsreview.com/chico/Archive?author=oid%3A43048 Technology Column called Technobabble]\n* [http://technobabble2dot0.wordpress.com Technology Blog called Technobabble 2.0]\n*[https://continuingmissionsta.com/2017/09/18/need-some-technobabble-for-your-game/ Technobabble Generators]\n\n[[Category:Jargon]]\n[[Category:Language varieties and styles]]\n[[Category:Science fiction terminology]]\n", "text_old": "{{redirect-distinguish|Technospeak|technical jargon}}\n{{Multiple issues|\n{{original research|date=January 2018}}\n{{more citations needed|date=January 2018}}\n}}\n\n'''Technobabble''' (a [[portmanteau]] of ''technology'' and ''babble''), also called '''technospeak''',<ref name=\"OED\">{{cite book| title=Oxford Desk Dictionary and Thesaurus| publisher=Spark Publishing| location=Oxford|year=2007| edition=2nd |isbn=978-1-4114-0508-0}}</ref> is a form of [[jargon]] that consists of [[buzzword]]s, [[wiktionary:esoteric|esoteric]] language, specialized technical terms, or technical slang that is impossible to understand for the average listener.
