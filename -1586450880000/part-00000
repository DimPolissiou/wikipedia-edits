Many, if not most, towns in northern Canada, where agriculture is difficult, exist because of a nearby mine or source of timber. Canada is a world leader in the production of many natural resources such as [[gold]], [[nickel]], [[uranium mining in Canada|uranium]], [[Canadian diamonds|diamonds]], [[lead]], and in recent years, [[petroleum industry in Canada|crude petroleum]], which, with the world's second-largest oil reserves, is taking an increasingly prominent position in natural resources extraction. Several of Canada's largest companies are based in natural resource industries, such as [[Encana]], [[Cameco]], [[Goldcorp]], and [[Barrick Gold]]. The vast majority of these products are exported, mainly to the United States. There are also many secondary and service industries that are directly linked to primary ones. For instance one of Canada's largest manufacturing industries is the [[pulp and paper]] sector, which is directly linked to the [[Forestry in Canada|logging]] business.\n\nThe reliance on natural resources has several effects on the Canadian economy and Canadian society. While manufacturing and service industries are easy to standardize, natural resources vary greatly by region. This ensures that differing economic structures developed in each region of Canada, contributing to Canada's strong regionalism. At the same time the vast majority of these resources are exported, integrating Canada closely into the international economy. Howlett and Ramesh argue that the inherent instability of such industries also contributes to greater government intervention in the economy, to reduce the social impact of market changes.<ref>Howlett, Michael and M. Ramesh. ''Political Economy of Canada: An Introduction.'' Toronto: McClelland and Stewart, 1992.</ref>\n\nNatural resource industries also raise important questions of sustainability. Despite many decades as a leading producer, there is little risk of depletion. Large discoveries continue to be made, such as the massive nickel find at [[Voisey's Bay]]. Moreover, the far north remains largely undeveloped as producers await higher prices or new technologies as many operations in this region are not yet cost effective. In recent decades Canadians have become less willing to accept the environmental destruction associated with exploiting natural resources. High wages and Aboriginal land claims have also curbed expansion. Instead many Canadian companies have focused their exploration, exploitation and expansion activities overseas where prices are lower and governments more amenable. Canadian companies are increasingly playing important roles in Latin America, Southeast Asia, and Africa.\n\nThe depletion of renewable resources has raised concerns in recent years. After decades of escalating overutilization the [[Cod fisheries|cod fishery]] all but collapsed in the 1990s, and the Pacific salmon industry also suffered greatly. The [[Forestry in Canada|logging]] industry, after many years of activism, has in recent years moved to a more sustainable model, or to other countries.\n\n=== Data ===\nThe following table shows the main economic indicators in 1980\u20132018.

Measures of productivity include [[Gross Domestic Product]] (GDP)(OECD 2008,11) and [[multifactor productivity]].\n\n===Multifactor productivity===\n\nAnother productivity measure, used by the OECD, is the long-term trend in multifactor productivity (MFP) also known as [[total factor productivity]] (TFP). This indicator assesses an economy's \"underlying productive capacity ('potential output'), itself an important measure of the growth possibilities of economies and of inflationary pressures\". MFP measures the residual growth that cannot be explained by the rate of change in the services of labour, capital and intermediate outputs, and is often interpreted as the contribution to economic growth made by factors such as technical and organisational innovation. (OECD 2008,11)\n\nAccording to the OECD's annual economic survey of Canada in June 2012, Canada has experienced weak growth of multi-factor productivity (MFP) and has been declining further since 2002. One of the ways MFP growth is raised is by boosting innovation and Canada's innovation indicators such as business R&D and patenting rates were poor. Raising MFP growth is \"needed to sustain rising living standards, especially as the population ages\".<ref name=OECD2012>{{cite report|title=OECD Economic Surveys Canada June 2012 Overview |url=http://www.oecd.org/eco/50543310.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130616120842/http://www.oecd.org/eco/50543310.pdf |archivedate=2013-06-16 |format=PDF |year=2012 |publisher=Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Bank of Canada==\nThe mandate of the central bank\u2014the [[Bank of Canada]] is to conduct monetary policy that \"preserves the value of money by keeping inflation low and stable\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bankofcanada.ca/|title=Bank of Canada|website=www.bankofcanada.ca}}</ref><ref name=\"Monetary_Policy_Report_2015_07\"/>\n\n===Monetary Policy Report===\nThe Bank of Canada issues its bank rate announcement through its [[Monetary Policy Report (Canada)|Monetary Policy Report]] which is released eight times a year.<ref name=\"Monetary_Policy_Report_2015_07\">{{cite report |url=http://www.bankofcanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/mpr-2015-07-15.pdf |format=PDF |date=15 July 2015 |accessdate=6 August 2015 |title=Monetary Policy Report}}</ref> The [[Bank of Canada]], a federal crown corporation, has the responsibility of Canada's monetary system.<ref name=\"Blake 2007\"/> Under the [[inflation targeting|inflation-targeting]] monetary policy that has been the cornerstone of Canada's monetary and fiscal policy since the early 1990s, the Bank of Canada sets an inflation target<ref name=\"Monetary_Policy_Report_2015_07\" /><ref name=\"inflation-targeting_2010\">{{citation |url=http://www.bankofcanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/inflation_control_target.pdf |title=Inflation-Control Target Backgrounder |publisher=Bank of Canada |date=November 2010}}</ref> The inflation target was set at 2 per cent, which is the midpoint of an inflation range of 1 to 3 per cent.

In year-to-date 2019 (through March), further referred to as YTD 2019, Canada exported 1.39 million metric tons of steel, a 22 percent decrease from 1.79 million metric tons in YTD 2018. Canada's exports represented about 1.5 percent of all steel exported globally in 2017, based on available data. By volume, Canada's 2018 steel exports represented just over one-tenth the volume of the world's largest exporter, China. In value terms, steel represented 1.4 percent of the total goods Canada exported in 2018. The growth in exports in the decade since 2009 has been 29%. The largest producers in 2018 were [[ArcelorMittal]], [[Essar Steel Algoma]], and the first of those alone accounted for roughly half of Canadian steel production through its two subsidiaries. The top two markets for Canada's exports were its [[NAFTA]] partners, and by themselves accounted for 92 percent of exports by volume. Canada sent 83 percent of its steel exports to the United States in YTD 2019.

This makes Canada the world's sixth-largest producer of electricity generated by nuclear power, producing 95 TWh in 2017.<ref>{{cite web|title=Top 15 Nuclear Generating Countries|url=https://www.nei.org/resources/statistics/top-15-nuclear-generating-countries|publisher=Nuclear Energy Institute|accessdate=31 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nFossil fuels provide 19% of Canadian electric power, about half as coal (9% of the total) and the remainder a mix of natural gas and oil. Only five provinces use coal for electricity generation. Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Nova Scotia rely on coal for nearly half their generation while other provinces and territories use little or none. Alberta and Saskatchewan also use a substantial amount of natural gas. Remote communities including all of Nunavut and much of the Northwest Territories produce most of their electricity from diesel generators, at high economic and environmental cost.

Many, if not most, towns in northern Canada, where agriculture is difficult, exist because of a nearby mine or source of timber. Canada is a world leader in the production of many natural resources such as [[gold]], [[nickel]], [[uranium mining in Canada|uranium]], [[Canadian diamonds|diamonds]], [[lead]], and in recent years, [[petroleum industry in Canada|crude petroleum]], which, with the world's second-largest oil reserves, is taking an increasingly prominent position in natural resources extraction. Several of Canada's largest companies are based in natural resource industries, such as [[Encana]], [[Cameco]], [[Goldcorp]], and [[Barrick Gold]]. The vast majority of these products are exported, mainly to the United States. There are also many secondary and service industries that are directly linked to primary ones. For instance one of Canada's largest manufacturing industries is the [[pulp and paper]] sector, which is directly linked to the [[Forestry in Canada|logging]] business.\n\nThe reliance on natural resources has several effects on the Canadian economy and Canadian society. While manufacturing and service industries are easy to standardize, natural resources vary greatly by region. This ensures that differing economic structures developed in each region of Canada, contributing to Canada's strong regionalism. At the same time the vast majority of these resources are exported, integrating Canada closely into the international economy. Howlett and Ramesh argue that the inherent instability of such industries also contributes to greater government intervention in the economy, to reduce the social impact of market changes.<ref>Howlett, Michael and M. Ramesh. ''Political Economy of Canada: An Introduction.'' Toronto: McClelland and Stewart, 1992.</ref>\n\nNatural resource industries also raise important questions of sustainability. Despite many decades as a leading producer, there is little risk of depletion. Large discoveries continue to be made, such as the massive nickel find at [[Voisey's Bay]]. Moreover, the far north remains largely undeveloped as producers await higher prices or new technologies as many operations in this region are not yet cost effective. In recent decades Canadians have become less willing to accept the environmental destruction associated with exploiting natural resources. High wages and Aboriginal land claims have also curbed expansion. Instead many Canadian companies have focused their exploration, exploitation and expansion activities overseas where prices are lower and governments more amenable. Canadian companies are increasingly playing important roles in Latin America, Southeast Asia, and Africa.\n\nThe depletion of renewable resources has raised concerns in recent years. After decades of escalating overutilization the [[Cod fisheries|cod fishery]] all but collapsed in the 1990s, and the Pacific salmon industry also suffered greatly. The [[Forestry in Canada|logging]] industry, after many years of activism, has in recent years moved to a more sustainable model, or to other countries.\n\n=== Data ===\nThe following table shows the main economic indicators in 1980\u20132018.

Measures of productivity include [[Gross Domestic Product]] (GDP)(OECD 2008,11) and [[multifactor productivity]].\n\n===Multifactor productivity===\n\nAnother productivity measure, used by the OECD, is the long-term trend in multifactor productivity (MFP) also known as [[total factor productivity]] (TFP). This indicator assesses an economy's \"underlying productive capacity ('potential output'), itself an important measure of the growth possibilities of economies and of inflationary pressures\". MFP measures the residual growth that cannot be explained by the rate of change in the services of labour, capital and intermediate outputs, and is often interpreted as the contribution to economic growth made by factors such as technical and organisational innovation. (OECD 2008,11)\n\nAccording to the OECD's annual economic survey of Canada in June 2012, Canada has experienced weak growth of multi-factor productivity (MFP) and has been declining further since 2002. One of the ways MFP growth is raised is by boosting innovation and Canada's innovation indicators such as business R&D and patenting rates were poor. Raising MFP growth is \"needed to sustain rising living standards, especially as the population ages\".<ref name=OECD2012>{{cite report|title=OECD Economic Surveys Canada June 2012 Overview |url=http://www.oecd.org/eco/50543310.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130616120842/http://www.oecd.org/eco/50543310.pdf |archivedate=2013-06-16 |format=PDF |year=2012 |publisher=Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Bank of Canada==\nThe mandate of the central bank\u2014the [[Bank of Canada]] is to conduct monetary policy that \"preserves the value of money by keeping inflation low and stable\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bankofcanada.ca/|title=Bank of Canada|website=www.bankofcanada.ca}}</ref><ref name=\"Monetary_Policy_Report_2015_07\"/>\n\n===Monetary Policy Report===\nThe Bank of Canada issues its bank rate announcement through its [[Monetary Policy Report (Canada)|Monetary Policy Report]] which is released eight times a year.<ref name=\"Monetary_Policy_Report_2015_07\">{{cite report |url=http://www.bankofcanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/mpr-2015-07-15.pdf |format=PDF |date=15 July 2015 |accessdate=6 August 2015 |title=Monetary Policy Report}}</ref> The [[Bank of Canada]], a federal crown corporation, has the responsibility of Canada's monetary system.<ref name=\"Blake 2007\"/> Under the [[inflation targeting|inflation-targeting]] monetary policy that has been the cornerstone of Canada's monetary and fiscal policy since the early 1990s, the Bank of Canada sets an inflation target<ref name=\"Monetary_Policy_Report_2015_07\" /><ref name=\"inflation-targeting_2010\">{{citation |url=http://www.bankofcanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/inflation_control_target.pdf |title=Inflation-Control Target Backgrounder |publisher=Bank of Canada |date=November 2010}}</ref> The inflation target was set at 2 per cent, which is the midpoint of an inflation range of 1 to 3 per cent.

All but $848.2 million were subsidies worth less than 5% of the value of the crops they were provided for.\n\n==Free-trade agreements==\n{{Main|Free-trade agreements of Canada}}\n[[File:FTAs with Canada.svg|thumb|right|275px|{{Legend|#000|Canada}}{{Legend|#393|Free-trade areas}}]]\n\n===Free-trade agreements in force===\n\n:Source:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.international.gc.ca/trade-agreements-accords-commerciaux/agr-acc/fta-ale.aspx?lang=eng |title=Canada's Free Trade Agreements |publisher=International.gc.ca |accessdate=2013-12-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140312210043/http://www.international.gc.ca/trade-agreements-accords-commerciaux/agr-acc/fta-ale.aspx?lang=eng |archive-date=March 12, 2014 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n*[[Canada\u2013U.S. Free Trade Agreement]] (Signed 12 October 1987, entered into force 1 January 1989, later superseded by NAFTA)\n*[[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (Entered into force 1 January 1994, includes Canada, U.S. and Mexico)\n*[[Canada\u2013Israel Free Trade Agreement]] (Entered into force 1 January 1997, modernization ongoing)\n*[[Canada\u2013Chile Free Trade Agreement]] (Entered into force 5 July 1997)\n*[[Canada\u2013Costa Rica Free Trade Agreement]] (Entered into force 1 November 2002, modernization ongoing)\n*[[Canada\u2013European Free Trade Association Free Trade Agreement]] (Iceland, Norway, Switzerland and Liechtenstein; entered into force 01-Jul-2009)\n*[[Canada\u2013Peru Free Trade Agreement]] (Entered into force 1 August 2009)\n*[[Canada\u2013Colombia Free Trade Agreement]] (Signed 21 November 2008, entered into force 15 August 2011; Canada's ratification of this FTA had been dependent upon Colombia's ratification of the \"Agreement Concerning Annual Reports on Human Rights and Free Trade Between Canada and the Republic of Colombia\" signed on 27 May 2010)\n*Canada\u2013Jordan Free Trade Agreement (Signed on 28 June 2009, entered into force 1 October 2012)\n*[[Canada\u2013Panama Free Trade Agreement]] (Signed on 14 May 2010, entered into force 1 April 2013)\n*[[Canada\u2013South Korea Free Trade Agreement]] (Signed on 11 March 2014, entered into force 1 January 2015)\n*[[Canada\u2013Ukraine Free Trade Agreement]] (concluded 14 July 2015, entered into force 1 August 2017)\n*[[Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership]] (signed 8 March 2018, entered into force 30 December 2018)\n\n===Free-trade agreements concluded===\n:Source:<ref name=\"Canada's Free Trade Agreements\">{{cite web |url=http://www.international.gc.ca/trade-agreements-accords-commerciaux/agr-acc/fta-ale.aspx?lang=eng |title=Canada's Free Trade Agreements |publisher=International.gc.ca |access-date=March 11, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140312210043/http://www.international.gc.ca/trade-agreements-accords-commerciaux/agr-acc/fta-ale.aspx?lang=eng |archive-date=March 12, 2014 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n*[[Trans-Pacific Partnership]] (concluded 5 October 2015, superseded by CPTPP)\n*[[Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement]] (concluded 5 August 2014)\n*[[United States\u2013Mexico\u2013Canada Agreement]] (to supersede NAFTA, concluded 30 November 2018)\n\n===Ongoing free-trade agreements negotiations===\n:Source:<ref name=\"Canada's Free Trade Agreements\"/>\nCanada is negotiating bilateral FTAs with the following countries respectively trade blocs:\n*Caribbean Community ([[CARICOM]])\n*[[Guatemala]], [[Nicaragua]] and [[El Salvador]]\n*[[Dominican Republic]]\n*[[India]]\n*[[Japan]]<ref>{{cite news|author=The Canadian Press |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/story/2011/02/23/canada-japan-free-trade.html |title=Canada, Japan study free-trade pact|publisher=CBC News |date=2011-02-24 |accessdate=2011-02-28}}</ref>\n*[[Morocco]]\n*[[Singapore]]\n*[[Andean Community]] (FTA's are already in force with Peru and Colombia)\n\nCanada has been involved in negotiations to create the following regional trade blocks:\n\n*Canada and Central American Free Trade Agreement\n*[[Free Trade Area of the Americas]] (FTAA)\n\n==Political issues==\n=== Relations with the U.S. ===\n{{Main|Canada\u2013United States trade relations}}\nCanada and the United States share a common trading relationship.
