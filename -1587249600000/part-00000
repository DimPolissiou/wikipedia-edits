Generally, tourists came from overseas, entering the country through the [[Port of Lim\u00f3n]], then commuting to San Jos\u00e9 by train. On 16 June 1931, Law 91 was passed, creating the National Tourism Board, which operated until it was replaced by the [[Instituto Costarricense de Turismo]] on 9 August 1955.<ref>{{cite web | title=General Framework |url=http://www.visitcostarica.com/ict/paginas/TourismBoard.asp |publisher=Instituto Costarricense de Turismo |accessdate=17 October 2012}}</ref>\n\nCurrently, tourism ranks as Costa Rica's second highest source of revenue. In 2000, revenue from tourism accounted for 21% of Costa Rica's total exports. Increasingly, Costa Rica is becoming reliant upon tourism as a source of income; the number of tourist arrivals in 2000 had more than doubled compared to the number of tourists a decade earlier.<ref>{{cite web |last=Inman |first=Crist |title=Tourism in Costa Rica: The Challenge of Competitiveness |url=http://www.incae.edu/ES/clacds/publicaciones/pdf/cen653.pdf |publisher=INCAE |accessdate=17 October 2012}}</ref>\n\n=== Prominence ===\nIn the early 2010s, [[Interpol]] named Costa Rica the fastest-growing capital for sex tourism in Latin America.<ref>{{cite web | last=Ercolani |first=Steve |title=Study Looks at Costa Rica's Sex Tourism Industry |url=http://www.ticotimes.net/Current-Edition/News-Briefs/Study-looks-at-Costa-Rica-s-sex-tourism-industry_Thursday-October-04-2012 |publisher=Tico Times |date=4 October 2012 |accessdate=17 October 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121005021546/http://www.ticotimes.net/Current-Edition/News-Briefs/Study-looks-at-Costa-Rica-s-sex-tourism-industry_Thursday-October-04-2012|archivedate=5 October 2012}}</ref> [[Jac\u00f3, Costa Rica|Jac\u00f3]] and San Jos\u00e9 are two of Costa Rica's most prominent sex-tourism locations.

Acts of violence committed towards prostitutes often go ignored. The issue of violence towards prostitutes is not an issue that goes unnoticed by policy-makers and physicians. Rather, many choose to disregard the plight of these women. Women seeking medical treatment or asylum are generally ignored and thought to be deserving of the violence they suffer.

In the same article, Bruce Harris, regional director of Casa Alianza (the Latin American branch of international child care agency Covenant House) said that; even though child prostitution was identified across [[Central America]], the problem seemed to be more \"out of control\" in Costa Rica. Exact numbers of the children involved were unknown at the time, and the government of Costa Rica had not gathered detailed statistics.<ref>\n[https://www.motherjones.com/news/feature/2000/10/costarica.html Innocence for Sale] ''Mother Jones'' 10 October 2000.</ref>\n\nCosta Rican Congresswoman Gloria Bejerano cites globalization as one of the factors halting attempts to cease child prostitution, as access to communication and media technologies is widespread. While production and distribution of child pornography is a punishable offense, possession of such materials is not.<ref name=\"Child\" />\n\nThe sexual exploitation of children is a significant issue in Costa Rica, and has drawn the attention of the public. Many sex tourists prefer to target children, believing that they are less likely to be infected with HIV. However, children are more susceptible to HIV infection than other age groups. The governmental organization Alianza por tus Derechos (\u201cAlliance for your rights\u201d) pushes for the implementation of new, harsher laws to coincide with the heinousness of the crimes being committed. Very few instances of child prostitution are actually reported to authorities due to the poor categorization of these crimes in legislation.<ref name=\"Attractions\" /><ref name=\"Child\" /> Since 2004 the government and the tourism industry have implemented several initiatives to curb child prostitution, including education campaigns among tourist industry workers to report any illicit activity regarding minors.<ref name=Wright/> Anyone convicted of buying sex from a minor can suffer prison terms of up to 10 years.<ref name=WPCosta />\n\nChild prostitution is widespread.

Such efforts were the Law Against Organized Crime in 2009, and the Law for Protection of Victims and Witnesses in 2010. Immigration and the District Attorney's office assert that efforts thus far have been inadequate, as there have only been two human trafficking cases ending in a strict sentence since the passing of these laws.

Abandoned and afraid, these children seldom find their way back home, and the ones who do are usually ostracized from society.<ref name=\"Attractions\" /> In 2016, the phenomenon of fathers \"renting\" their daughters as child prostitutes has been called common in [[Lim\u00f3n Province]], but occurred throughout the country.

However, it is nearly impossible to know just how many victims of human trafficking there are in the country. For each person rescued from a human trafficking operation, there are at least 20 cases that go unreported, according to Costa Rican immigration authorities. This estimate places the number of trafficking victims in Costa Rica in the past few years somewhere around 1,500.<ref name=\"Stand\"/>\n\nDespite attempts by Costa Rican authorities to improve the situation in Costa Rica, their efforts have had little to no effect. Such efforts were the \"Law Against Organized Crime\" in 2009, and the \"Law for Protection of Victims and Witnesses\" in 2010. Immigration and the district attorney's office assert that efforts thus far have been inadequate, as there have only been two human trafficking cases ending in a strict sentence since the passing of these laws. Lawmakers have since redoubled their efforts, unanimously approving the Law Against Human Trafficking, which would raise the maximum penalty of human trafficking to 16 years.<ref name=\"Stand\" />\n\nThe [[United States Department of State]] [[Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons]] ranks Costa Rica as a '[[Trafficking in Persons Report#Ranking System|Tier 2]]' country.<ref name=\"state18\">{{cite web |title=Costa Rica 2018 Trafficking in Persons Report |url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/countries/2018/282637.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180728002856/https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/countries/2018/282637.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=28 July 2018 |website=U.S. Department of State |accessdate=26 July 2018}}{{PD-notice}}</ref>\n\n=== International responses ===\nThe [[United Nations]] has been an extremely active force in efforts to prevent human trafficking and child sex tourism in Latin American countries.

In 2000, an Optional Protocol to the CRC on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography was introduced. Many of the articles in the CRC concern the sexual exploitation of children, and the rights of children to be protected from such activities.<ref name=\"Attractions\" />\n\nIn 1999, the [[International Labour Organization]] Convention coordinated massive efforts to eradicate many forms of child labor, including the sale and [[trafficking of children]], as well as the sexual exploitation of children for pornography or prostitution.<ref name=\"Attractions\" />\n\nMany countries sought to strengthen existing laws regarding the exploitation of children. Facing pressure from various child welfare groups, the United States passed the [[PROTECT Act]] in April 2003. The act made it illegal for U.S. citizens to travel to another country to have sex, or to conspire to have sex, with a minor. The law also raised the maximum sentence of individuals who either engaged in, or attempted to engage in, sex with a minor to 30 years.\n\nSince 2004, [[World Vision]], a Christian [[humanitarian organization]] operating in nearly 100 countries, has run a campaign to prevent child sex tourism, and to raise awareness of legislation regarding child sex tourism. Under the slogan \u201c\u2018Abuse a child in this country, go to jail in yours,\u2019\u201d World Vision launched a campaign to deter child sex tourists in Cambodia, Thailand, Costa Rica, Mexico,  and Brazil.<ref name=\"Social\" /> The campaign, termed the Child Sex Tourism Prevention Project, was conducted in cooperation with various U.S. government agencies. The project sought to deter sex tourists through various in-flight advertisements and brochure, billboard, and other media warning sex tourists that they are subject to prosecution.<ref name=\"Attractions\" />\n\nAlso in 2004, the [[World Tourism Organization]] (WTO), in conjunction with [[ECPAT]] and [[UNICEF]], headed an effort to encourage American travel agencies to abide by a code of conduct. Under the code, hotel and travel companies commit to establishing a policy against commercial sexual exploitation of children.<ref name=\"Attractions\" />\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{cite book|last1=Hayes|first1=Anne|title=Female Prostitution in Costa Rica: Historical Perspectives, 1880-1930|date=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781135525682|url=https://books.google.com/?id=tWrbAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA80&lpg=PA80&dq=costa+rica+registration+of+prostitutes#v=onepage&q=costa%20rica%20registration%20of%20prostitutes&f=false|language=en|ref=none}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.csmonitor.com/2004/0422/p11s01-wogi.html Global campaign to police child sex tourism] ''The Christian Science Monitor'' 2004-04-22\n\n{{North America in topic|Prostitution in}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Prostitution In Costa Rica}}\n[[Category:Prostitution by country|Costa Rica]]\n[[Category:Costa Rican society]]\n[[Category:Crime in Costa Rica]]\n[[Category:Prostitution in North America|Costa Rica]]\n[[Category:Tourism in Costa Rica]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2020}}\n'''Prostitution in Costa Rica''' is legal.

In the same article, Bruce Harris, regional director of Casa Alianza (the Latin American branch of international child care agency Covenant House) said that; even though child prostitution was identified across [[Central America]], the problem seemed to be more \"out of control\" in Costa Rica.

Many sex tourists prefer to target children, believing that they are less likely to be infected with HIV. However, children are more susceptible to HIV infection than other age groups. The governmental organization Alianza por tus Derechos (\u201cAlliance for your rights\u201d) pushes for the implementation of new, harsher laws to coincide with the heinousness of the crimes being committed. Very few instances of child prostitution are actually reported to authorities due to the poor categorization of these crimes in legislation.<ref name=\"Attractions\" /><ref name=\"Child\" /> Since 2004 the government and the tourism industry have implemented several initiatives to curb child prostitution, including education campaigns among tourist industry workers to report any illicit activity regarding minors.<ref name=Wright/> Anyone convicted of buying sex from a minor can suffer prison terms of up to 10 years.<ref name=WPCosta />\n\nChild prostitution is widespread.

Immigration and the District Attorney's office assert that efforts thus far have been inadequate, as there have only been two human trafficking cases ending in a strict sentence since the passing of these laws.

In 2000, an Optional Protocol to the CRC on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography was introduced. Many of the articles in the CRC concern the sexual exploitation of children, and the rights of children to be protected from such activities.<ref name=\"Attractions\" />\n\nIn 1999, the [[International Labour Organization]] Convention coordinated massive efforts to eradicate many forms of child labor, including the sale and [[trafficking of children]], as well as the sexual exploitation of children for pornography or prostitution.<ref name=\"Attractions\" />\n\nMany countries sought to strengthen existing laws regarding the exploitation of children. Facing pressure from various child welfare groups, the United States passed the [[PROTECT Act]] in April 2003. The act made it illegal for U.S. citizens to travel to another country to have sex, or to conspire to have sex, with a minor. The law also raised the maximum sentence of individuals who either engaged in, or attempted to engage in, sex with a minor to 30 years.\n\nSince 2004, [[World Vision]], a Christian [[humanitarian organization]] operating in nearly 100 countries, has run a campaign to prevent child sex tourism, and to raise awareness of legislation regarding child sex tourism. Under the slogan \u201c\u2018Abuse a child in this country, go to jail in yours,\u2019\u201d World Vision launched a campaign to deter child sex tourists in Cambodia, Thailand, Costa Rica, Mexico,  and Brazil.<ref name=\"Social\" /> The campaign, termed the Child Sex Tourism Prevention Project, was conducted in cooperation with various U.S. government agencies. The project sought to deter sex tourists through various in-flight advertisements and brochure, billboard, and other media warning sex tourists that they are subject to prosecution.<ref name=\"Attractions\" />\n\nAlso in 2004, the [[World Tourism Organization]] (WTO), in conjunction with [[ECPAT]] and [[UNICEF]], headed an effort to encourage American travel agencies to abide by a code of conduct.

He is the main protagonist of the ''Modern Warfare'' sub-series being one of two characters to be featured in all of the games in the sub-series, the other being Nikolai. Price first ranked as a lieutenant, and served as a [[sniper]] under the orders of Captain MacMillan, participating in a mission to assassinate Ultranationalist Leader Imran Zakhaev in Pripyat, Ukraine in 1996. He was then promoted to a Captain and took charge of a [[Special Air Service]] squad, codenamed \"Bravo Team\", which included [[Soap MacTavish|Captain John \"Soap\" MacTavish]], before being held prisoner in a Russian gulag after ''[[Find Makarov: Operation Kingfish]]''. After being rescued by Task Force 141 from the gulag, he was then assigned to Task Force 141 but was considered a war criminal after he and Captain MacTavish killed General Shepherd. He then participated in a joint operation with Delta Force's Team Metal, rescuing Alena Vorshevsky, and her father, the Russian President, after they had been kidnapped by Makarov and his forces, before tracking down and killing Makarov in a hotel.\n\n==Character design==\nThe first iteration of Captain Price was in ''[[Call of Duty (video game)|Call of Duty]]''. Initially a captain of D Company, 2nd (Airborne) Battalion [[Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry]] charged with seizing [[Pegasus Bridge]] prior to the [[Invasion of Normandy]], Price is later seconded to 3 Troop, [[Special Air Service]] (SAS) along with the player character, Sergeant Jack Evans. He would appear again in ''[[Call of Duty 2]]'', this time as a captain in the [[7th Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|7th Armoured Division]], fighting in the [[North African campaign]] and then later in the [[Battle for Caen]]. The character design borrowed heavily from [[Michael Graham Cox]]'s portrayal of [[James Cleminson|Captain Jimmy Cleminson]] in the ensemble war movie ''[[A Bridge Too Far (film)|A Bridge Too Far]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jpgdump.com/viewer.php?id=15221 |title=Price in A Bridge Too Far |publisher=Jpgdump.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-21}}</ref> Cleminson, while only in his early twenties, indeed sported a large moustache; during the [[Battle of Arnhem]] Cleminson found himself trapped in an attic with the commander of the [[1st Airborne Division (United Kingdom)|1st Airborne Division]], Major-General [[Roy Urquhart]], who chided Cleminson for his \"damned silly\" moustache. The character's third appearance was as a Captain in the SAS in ''[[Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare]]'', followed by further appearances in ''[[Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2]]'' and ''[[Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3]]''. Still bearing a large moustache, this modern take on Captain Price drew further inspiration from British SAS soldier [[John McAleese]],<ref name=\"SAS\">{{cite web|url=http://www.popularairsoft.com/sas-legend-john-mcaleese-iranian-embassy-raid-leader-dies-61|title=John McAleese|accessdate=2007-06-21}}</ref> who was involved in the [[Iranian Embassy siege]] and also co-hosted the television series ''[[SAS: Are You Tough Enough?]]'' in 2003. McAleese was also well known for his large moustache. Price's callsign, Bravo Six, is a direct reference to the 1986 war film ''[[Platoon (film)|Platoon]]'', in which Captain Harris' callsign is exactly the same as Price's. Over the course of the franchise, Captain John Price has been portrayed by [[Michael Gough (voice actor)|Michael Gough]], [[Billy Murray (actor)|Billy Murray]] and [[Barry Sloane]].\n\nIn an interview with Sami Onur, a character designer for [[Infinity Ward]], the explanation was provided that John Price is the grandson of the Price who appeared in early ''Call of Duty'' games, though this has not yet been confirmed by Infinity Ward staff.<ref>[http://www.merlininkazani.com/Call_of_Duty_4te_bir_Turk_imzasi-oyun_roportaj-2935p3.html Samin Onur interview] {{in lang|tr}}</ref> In the early developments of ''[[Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2|Modern Warfare 2]]'', Price was scheduled to be the player's commander, not \"Soap\" MacTavish, as he was supposed to be the playable character instead of Roach. This is further explained in the artbook for ''Modern Warfare 2''.<ref>''Behind the Lines: The Art of MW2''</ref>\n\n===Personality===\nPrice is known to be ruthless towards his enemies. This can be seen when he tells Captain MacMillan that he was going to \"kill them all\" after MacMillan asked him what he was going to do with all of the equipment that he had acquired. However, he is also a man who can be funny at some times, often cracking jokes during missions. Price is also a very caring man. Although he seemed to be very hostile to Soap when they first met, they eventually became the best of friends, and Price was devastated over his death. Price is also very serious and thoughtful. On what was to be a \"death mission\", Captain Price gave a short speech to Soap about how knowing how and when he will die is not a curse, rather a blessing, and how \"this land\" (Afghanistan) will remember what they did on this mission.\n\n==Appearances==\n===Original ''Modern Warfare'' timeline===\nIn ''Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare'', Captain Price serves as the commanding officer of primary protagonist John \"Soap\" MacTavish. He is also the player character for two flashback missions set in Pripyat in 1996, these being \"[[All Ghillied Up]]\" and \"One Shot One Kill\". The missions explore an assassination attempt on main antagonist Imran Zakhaev. At the conclusion of the game, he is severely wounded in a tanker truck explosion, but passes an [[M1911 pistol]] to Soap so he can kill Zakhaev.\n\nPrice survives this incident, and is encountered again in ''Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2''. He is discovered imprisoned by terrorist Vladimir Makarov after [[Find Makarov: Operation Kingfish|an attempt to capture him gone awry]], and joins Task Force 141 in an attempt to stop a war between the United States and Russia. However, Task Force 141 is betrayed by their commanding officer, General Shepherd, who orchestrated the war in order to raise American patriotism and become a war hero. Price and Soap embark on a suicide mission to kill Shepherd and avenge their comrades; they succeed in doing so, although Task Force 141 is disavowed and they are labelled terrorists.\n\nIn ''Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3'', Price and Soap ally with Yuri, an ex-[[Spetsnaz]] operative, and Team Metal, a Delta Force fireteam, to kill Makarov and clear their names. During an assassination attempt in Prague, Makarov reveals he has a history with Yuri and kills Soap. Price learns that Yuri was formerly an associate of Makarov, but betrayed him during [[No Russian|a terrorist attack on a civilian airport]]. The two work with Team Metal to rescue the Russian president and his daughter from Makarov, ending the war and clearing their names; Team Metal is killed in the battle. Several months later, Price and Yuri launch an assault on a hotel owned by Makarov and finally kill him at the cost of Yuri's life.\n\n===New ''Modern Warfare'' timeline===\n{{Expand section|date=January 2020}}\nIn [[Call of Duty: Modern Warfare (2019 video game)|''Call of Duty: Modern Warfare'' (2019)]], Captain Price returns to the campaign, which takes place in a new timeline.<ref name=WP>{{cite news |last1=Hume |first1=Mike |title=\u2018Call of Duty: Modern Warfare\u2019 trailer revealed, release date Oct. 25 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/05/30/call-duty-modern-warfare-trailer-reveal/ |accessdate=May 30, 2019 |work=Washington Post |date=May 30, 2019 |language=en}}</ref> He is currently portrayed by actor [[Barry Sloane]].<ref>https://twitter.com/BarrySloane/status/1134172695149420544</ref>\n\nPrice is contacted by CIA agent Kate Laswell about the Russian nerve gas crisis.

He would appear again in ''[[Call of Duty 2]]'', this time as a captain in the [[7th Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|7th Armoured Division]], fighting in the [[North African campaign]] and then later in the [[Battle for Caen]]. The character design borrowed heavily from [[Michael Graham Cox]]'s portrayal of [[James Cleminson|Captain Jimmy Cleminson]] in the ensemble war movie ''[[A Bridge Too Far (film)|A Bridge Too Far]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jpgdump.com/viewer.php?id=15221 |title=Price in A Bridge Too Far |publisher=Jpgdump.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-21}}</ref> Cleminson, while only in his early twenties, indeed sported a large moustache; during the [[Battle of Arnhem]] Cleminson found himself trapped in an attic with the commander of the [[1st Airborne Division (United Kingdom)|1st Airborne Division]], Major-General [[Roy Urquhart]], who chided Cleminson for his \"damned silly\" moustache. The character's third appearance was as a Captain in the SAS in ''[[Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare]]'', followed by further appearances in ''[[Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2]]'' and ''[[Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3]]''. Still bearing a large moustache, this modern take on Captain Price drew further inspiration from British SAS soldier [[John McAleese]],<ref name=\"SAS\">{{cite web|url=http://www.popularairsoft.com/sas-legend-john-mcaleese-iranian-embassy-raid-leader-dies-61|title=John McAleese|accessdate=2007-06-21}}</ref> who was involved in the [[Iranian Embassy siege]] and also co-hosted the television series ''[[SAS: Are You Tough Enough?]]'' in 2003. McAleese was also well known for his large moustache. Price's callsign, Bravo Six, is a direct reference to the 1986 war film ''[[Platoon (film)|Platoon]]'', in which Captain Harris' callsign is exactly the same as Price's. Over the course of the franchise, Captain John Price has been portrayed by [[Michael Gough (voice actor)|Michael Gough]], [[Billy Murray (actor)|Billy Murray]] and [[Barry Sloane]].\n\nIn an interview with Sami Onur, a character designer for [[Infinity Ward]], the explanation was provided that John Price is the grandson of the Price who appeared in early ''Call of Duty'' games, though this has not yet been confirmed by Infinity Ward staff.<ref>[http://www.merlininkazani.com/Call_of_Duty_4te_bir_Turk_imzasi-oyun_roportaj-2935p3.html Samin Onur interview] {{in lang|tr}}</ref> In the early developments of ''[[Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2|Modern Warfare 2]]'', Price was scheduled to be the player's commander, not \"Soap\" MacTavish, as he was supposed to be the playable character instead of Roach. This is further explained in the artbook for ''Modern Warfare 2''.<ref>''Behind the Lines: The Art of MW2''</ref>\n\n===Personality===\nPrice is known to be ruthless towards his enemies. This can be seen when he tells Captain MacMillan that he was going to \"kill them all\" after MacMillan asked him what he was going to do with all of the equipment that he had acquired. However, he is also a man who can be funny at some times, often cracking jokes during missions. Price is also a very caring man. Although he seemed to be very hostile to Soap when they first met, they eventually became the best of friends, and Price was devastated over his death. Price is also very serious and thoughtful. On what was to be a \"death mission\", Captain Price gave a short speech to Soap about how knowing how and when he will die is not a curse, rather a blessing, and how \"this land\" (Afghanistan) will remember what they did on this mission.\n\n==Appearances==\n===Original ''Modern Warfare'' timeline===\nIn ''Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare'', Captain Price serves as the commanding officer of primary protagonist John \"Soap\" MacTavish. He is also the player character for two flashback missions set in Pripyat in 1996, these being \"[[All Ghillied Up]]\" and \"One Shot One Kill\". The missions explore an assassination attempt on main antagonist Imran Zakhaev. At the conclusion of the game, he is severely wounded in a tanker truck explosion, but passes an [[M1911 pistol]] to Soap so he can kill Zakhaev.\n\nPrice survives this incident, and is encountered again in ''Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2''. He is discovered imprisoned by terrorist Vladimir Makarov after [[Find Makarov: Operation Kingfish|an attempt to capture him gone awry]], and joins Task Force 141 in an attempt to stop a war between the United States and Russia. However, Task Force 141 is betrayed by their commanding officer, General Shepherd, who orchestrated the war in order to raise American patriotism and become a war hero. Price and Soap embark on a suicide mission to kill Shepherd and avenge their comrades; they succeed in doing so, although Task Force 141 is disavowed and they are labelled terrorists.\n\nIn ''Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3'', Price and Soap ally with Yuri, an ex-[[Spetsnaz]] operative, and Team Metal, a Delta Force fireteam, to kill Makarov and clear their names. During an assassination attempt in Prague, Makarov reveals he has a history with Yuri and kills Soap. Price learns that Yuri was formerly an associate of Makarov, but betrayed him during [[No Russian|a terrorist attack on a civilian airport]]. The two work with Team Metal to rescue the Russian president and his daughter from Makarov, ending the war and clearing their names; Team Metal is killed in the battle. Several months later, Price and Yuri launch an assault on a hotel owned by Makarov and finally kill him at the cost of Yuri's life.\n\n===New ''Modern Warfare'' timeline===\n{{Expand section|date=January 2020}}\nIn [[Call of Duty: Modern Warfare (2019 video game)|''Call of Duty: Modern Warfare'' (2019)]], Captain Price returns to the campaign, which takes place in a new timeline.<ref name=WP>{{cite news |last1=Hume |first1=Mike |title=\u2018Call of Duty: Modern Warfare\u2019 trailer revealed, release date Oct. 25 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/05/30/call-duty-modern-warfare-trailer-reveal/ |accessdate=May 30, 2019 |work=Washington Post |date=May 30, 2019 |language=en}}</ref> He is currently portrayed by actor [[Barry Sloane]].<ref>https://twitter.com/BarrySloane/status/1134172695149420544</ref>\n\nPrice is contacted by CIA agent Kate Laswell about the Russian nerve gas crisis.

They were the surviving members of the 1955-1956 period in the history of Sun Records when the label had its greatest chart and sales success. In the song, Perkins recounts that early history when Sun was instrumental in the emergence of rock and roll. He sings: \"I was here when it happened/ I watched Memphis give birth to rock and roll.\" He described how Elvis Presley's first recording session at Sun had been a catalyst for the emergence of the rock and roll genre. He also emphasized his own role in that evolution. He then traced that evolution to the emergence of [[The Beatles]] and [[The Rolling Stones]] in 1964.
