Under Mayor [[Heinrich Stroband]] (1586\u20131609), the city became centralized. Administrative power passed into the hands of the city council. In 1595 [[Jesuits]] arrived to promote the [[Counter-Reformation]], taking control of St. John's Church. The Protestant city officials tried to limit the influx of Catholics into the city, as Catholics (Jesuits and [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] friars) already controlled most of the churches, leaving only St. Mary's to Protestant citizens.\n\nIn 1677 the Prussian historian and educator [[Christoph Hartknoch]] was invited to be director of the [[Gymnasium (school)|Thorn Gymnasium]], a post which he held until his death in 1687. Hartknoch wrote histories of [[Prussia]], including the cities of [[Royal Prussia]].\n\nDuring the [[Great Northern War]] (1700\u201321), the city was besieged by Swedish troops.

In the second half of the 17th century, tensions between Catholics and Protestants grew, similarly to religious wars throughout Europe in the previous century. In the early 18th century about 50 percent of the populace, especially the gentry and middle class, were German-speaking Protestants, while the other 50 percent were Polish speaking Roman Catholics.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=XsRuj9KMnpIC&pg=PA223&dq=Thorn+Jablonski&hl=de&ei=5wtETbm6NciOswac1ZTHDg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Thorn%20Jablonski&f=false\n|title=Daniel Ernst Jablonski; Religion, Wissenschaft und Politik um 1700|first1=Joachim|last1=Bahlcke|page=227|publisher=|year=2008 |language=German|ISBN=978-3-447-05793-6}}</ref> Protestant influence was subsequently pushed back after the [[Tumult of Thorn]] of 1724.\n\n==In the age of the Polish partitions==\nIn 1793 the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] annexed the city following the [[Partitions of Poland|Second Partition of Poland]].

In 1870 [[French people|French]] [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] taken during the [[Franco-Prussian War]] were directed to build [[Toru\u0144 Fortress|a chain of forts surrounding the town]].

In general, the [[Interwar period|interwar period]] was a time of significant urban development in Toru\u0144. Major investments were completed in areas such as transportation (new streets, tramway lines and the Pi\u0142sudski Bridge), residential development (many new houses, particularly in [[Bydgoskie Przedmie\u015bcie]] suburb) and public buildings. Following the bridge's construction, in 1938 the nearby town of [[Podg\u00f3rz, Lublin Voivodeship|Podg\u00f3rz]], on the left bank of the Vistula, was incorporated into Toru\u0144.[[File:Toru\u0144 (DerHexer) 2010-07-17 004.jpg|thumb|Modern-day Toru\u0144, located on the banks of the [[Vistula]]]]\n\nThe Jewish community in Toru\u0144 was very active before World War II.

The German army entered the city on September 7, 1939.

The remaining ethnic German population was [[Expulsion of Germans after World War II|forcibly expelled]], primarily to [[East Germany]], between 1945 and 1947.\n\nAfter World War II, the population increased more than twofold and industry developed significantly.

Under Mayor [[Heinrich Stroband]] (1586\u20131609), the city became centralized. Administrative power passed into the hands of the city council. In 1595 [[Jesuits]] arrived to promote the [[Counter-Reformation]], taking control of St. John's Church. The Protestant city officials tried to limit the influx of Catholics into the city, as Catholics (Jesuits and [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] friars) already controlled most of the churches, leaving only St. Mary's to Protestant citizens.\n\nIn 1677 the Prussian historian and educator [[Christoph Hartknoch]] was invited to be director of the [[Gymnasium (school)|Thorn Gymnasium]], a post which he held until his death in 1687. Hartknoch wrote histories of [[Prussia]], including the cities of [[Royal Prussia]].\n\nDuring the [[Great Northern War]] (1700\u201321), the city was besieged by Swedish troops. The restoration of [[Augustus the Strong]] as King of Poland was prepared in the town in the [[Treaty of Thorn (1709)]] by Russian Tsar [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]]. In the second half of the 17th century, tensions between Catholics and Protestants grew, similarly to religious wars throughout Europe in the previous century. In the early 18th century about 50 percent of the populace, especially the gentry and middle class, were German-speaking Protestants, while the other 50 percent were Polish speaking Roman Catholics.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=XsRuj9KMnpIC&pg=PA223&dq=Thorn+Jablonski&hl=de&ei=5wtETbm6NciOswac1ZTHDg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Thorn%20Jablonski&f=false\n|title=Daniel Ernst Jablonski; Religion, Wissenschaft und Politik um 1700|first1=Joachim|last1=Bahlcke|page=227|publisher=|year=2008 |language=German|ISBN=978-3-447-05793-6}}</ref> Protestant influence was subsequently pushed back after the [[Tumult of Thorn]] of 1724.\n\n==In the age of the Polish partitions==\nIn 1793 the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] annexed the city following the [[Partitions of Poland|Second Partition of Poland]]. In 1807 [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] conquered part of the territory and made the city part of the [[Duchy of Warsaw]]. It was ruled by King [[Frederick Augustus I of Saxony|Frederick Augustus I]] of [[Saxony]], but Prussia regained control after Napoleon's defeat in 1814. In 1870 [[French people|French]] [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] taken during the [[Franco-Prussian War]] were directed to build [[Toru\u0144 Fortress|a chain of forts surrounding the town]]. The following year the city, along with the rest of Prussia, became part of the new [[German Empire]]. \n[[File:Most drogowyTORU\u0143.jpg|left|thumb|Toru\u0144 bridge blown up at the beginning of [[Second World War]]]]\n\nToru\u0144 was part of the area subject to Prussian and later German attempts to Germanise the province. Toru\u0144 became a centre of resistance to [[Germanization]] and ''[[Kulturkampf]]'' by Poles, who established a Polish-language newspaper, ''Gazeta Toru\u0144ska''.<ref name=\"PWN\"/> In 1875 a Polish Scientific Society was established, and in 1884 a secret organization dedicated to the restoration of Poland.<ref name=\"PWN\"/> According to the [[Treaty of Versailles]] following [[World War I]] in 1919, Toru\u0144 was part of the [[Polish Corridor]] assigned to [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]]. It became the capital of the [[Pomeranian Voivodeship (1919\u20131939)|then-Pomeranian Voivodeship]]\nDuring Prussian and German rule, especially in the second half of the 19th century, the German authorities promoted ethnic German settlement in the city by falsifying census results. To diminish the number of Poles, one method involved counting all bilingual Poles who spoke German as Germans. Additionally, German soldiers stationed in the city were included in census figures as citizens for propaganda purposes.<ref name=\"UMT\">\"Toru\u0144 dw\u00f3ch narod\u00f3w.\" ''Gazeta Miejska'' Nr 1 (44) z 13 stycznia 2000, Urzad Miasta Torunia (Toru\u0144 City Council).</ref> In order to achieve German majority over Polish population in Toru\u0144, German authorities helped settle large numbers of German officials, workers and craftsmen by legal and administrative means.<ref name=\"LK\">Lidia Kucht\u00f3wna, ''\"Wielkie dni ma\u0142ej sceny,\" Teatr Narodowy na Pomorzu.''

In general, the [[Interwar period|interwar period]] was a time of significant urban development in Toru\u0144. Major investments were completed in areas such as transportation (new streets, tramway lines and the Pi\u0142sudski Bridge), residential development (many new houses, particularly in [[Bydgoskie Przedmie\u015bcie]] suburb) and public buildings. Following the bridge's construction, in 1938 the nearby town of [[Podg\u00f3rz, Lublin Voivodeship|Podg\u00f3rz]], on the left bank of the Vistula, was incorporated into Toru\u0144.[[File:Toru\u0144 (DerHexer) 2010-07-17 004.jpg|thumb|Modern-day Toru\u0144, located on the banks of the [[Vistula]]]]\n\nThe Jewish community in Toru\u0144 was very active before World War II. Just before the Nazi German [[invasion of Poland]], Jews supported the Polish government fund-raising for Air Defence (Dz.U.R.P.Nr 26, poz. 176) much more generously than average Torunians. The German army entered the city on September 7, 1939. By the end of November the city was declared ''Judenfrei'', with several hundred Jews who chose to stay, deported to the [[\u0141\u00f3d\u017a Ghetto]] and other locations in the ''Warthegau''.<ref name=\"kirkuty\">{{cite web |url=http://www.kirkuty.xip.pl/torun_zydzi.htm |title=Zarys historii Torunskiej mniejszosci \u017bydowskiej (History of Jews in Torun) |publisher=Cmentarze \u017bydowskie w Polsce |work=\u017bydzi z Torunia |year=2013 |accessdate=2013-06-16 |author=Maciej Ko\u0142yszko}}</ref> [[Nazi Germany]] annexed the city, and administered it as part of [[Danzig-West Prussia]].  Poles were classified as [[Untermenschen]] by German authorities, with their fate being slave-labor, executions and [[Expulsion of Poles by Nazi Germany|expulsions]]. {{details|Expulsion of Poles by Nazi Germany}}\n\nDuring [[World War II]], the Germans used the chain of forts surrounding the city as [[POW]] camps, known collectively as [[Stalag XX-A]]. The city escaped significant destruction during the war. In 1945 it was taken by the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Red Army]]. The remaining ethnic German population was [[Expulsion of Germans after World War II|forcibly expelled]], primarily to [[East Germany]], between 1945 and 1947.\n\nAfter World War II, the population increased more than twofold and industry developed significantly. The founding of the [[Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toru\u0144|Nicolaus Copernicus University]] in 1945 was significant. Over the years, it has become one of the best universities in Poland. The university has strongly influenced the intellectual, artistic and cultural life of the city, as well as its perception by non-locals. The university was founded by Polish professors formerly associated with the [[Vilnius University|University of Wilno]].

The planted seed grows into a flower, and a tiny girl emerges from inside the blossom, no bigger than the old woman's thumb. The old woman names the tiny girl Thumbelina and raises her as her own. Although Thumbelina loves her mother, she craves companionship from someone her own size. One night, the fairy prince Cornelius stumbles upon Thumbelina after hearing her beautiful singing. The two take a ride on Cornelius' bumblebee and fall in love. During this ride, Mrs. Toad and her son Grundel are enchanted by Thumbelina's singing. Cornelius promises to return the next day, but that night, Mrs. Toad kidnaps Thumbelina from her bed and takes her away to her show boat, where she desires Thumbelina to join their troupe and marry Grundel, who is in love with her. After the toads leave Thumbelina alone on a lily pad to fetch a priest, she is rescued by Jacquimo, a swallow who is infatuated with complicated love stories and encourages Thumbelina to return home. Meanwhile, Cornelius learns of Thumbelina's kidnapping and returns to his kingdom, the Vale of the Fairies, to desperately ask his parents to try holding back the winter as long as they can.\n\nBack at the pond, Grundel is told by his two younger brothers Mozo and Gringo that Thumbelina had escaped to find Cornelius, and he ventures out to find her. While trying to get home, Thumbelina is ambushed by Berkeley Beetle, who becomes enamored with her singing and promises to show her the way home if she sings at his Beetle Ball first. She reluctantly complies, but her bug disguise falls off during the concert and she is denounced as ugly, and Beetle rejects her without helping her. Following Thumbelina's exit from the Ball, she is found by Jacquimo, who promises to find Cornelius for her. Beetle is confronted by Grundel and informs him that he let Thumbelina go. When Beetle is told that Thumbelina loves Cornelius, he suggests that Grundel should kidnap Cornelius and use him as bait to lure Thumbelina to him. Grundel coerces Beetle into partnership by removing his wings to ensure his cooperation. \n\nUpon the arrival of winter, Cornelius falls into a pond during his search for Thumbelina and is frozen, while Jacquimo injures his wing and loses consciousness from the extreme cold. With both Cornelius and Jacquimo incapacitated, Thumbelina is forced to take refuge in an old shoe, where she is discovered by Miss Fieldmouse and granted shelter in her underground lair. After relaying Cornelius' fate to Thumbelina, Miss Fieldmouse introduces her to her neighbor Mr. Mole, who is immediately infatuated with Thumbelina and desires to marry her. While touring Mr. Mole's tunnel, they come across Jacquimo's body, but Thumbelina discovers he is still alive. Devastated by the apparent loss of Cornelius, Thumbelina gives in to hopelessness and accepts Mr. Mole's proposal after some persuasion from Miss Fieldmouse. Thumbelina later visits Jacquimo and he revives,.  Refusing to believe Cornelius is dead, Jacquimo leaves to find him before the wedding.\n\nBeetle and Grundel find and abscond with Cornelius' frozen body and subsequently learn of Thumbelina's wedding. When they leave Cornelius behind and embark to Mr. Mole's home, a trio of friendly insects find and thaw Cornelius. At the wedding, Thumbelina finds herself unable to marry Mr. Mole after remembering Cornelius' promise to always love her. Grundel and Beetle suddenly appear and a chase ensues. Cornelius also appears and engages Grundel in a fight which culminates in the two falling into a chasm. Thumbelina escapes her pursuers and meets with Jacquimo, who has found the Vale of the Fairies and takes her there. Thumbelina and Cornelius reunite, and Thumbelina magically grows her own pair of wings upon accepting Cornelius' proposal. With Thumbelina\u2018s mother and the fairy court in attendance, the two marry and depart on Cornelius' bumblebee.\n\nMid-credits images reveal that Beetle's wings regrew and he resumed his pop career; Grundel survived the fall with a broken leg and married a female toad; and Mr. Mole married Miss Fieldmouse.\n\n==Voice cast==\n*[[Jodi Benson]] as [[Thumbelina]] \u2013 A tiny young woman who is not as big as her adoptive mother's thumb, and falls in love with the handsome fairy prince Cornelius.\n*[[Gary Imhoff]] as Prince Cornelius \u2013 the Prince of the Fairies and Thumbelina's love interest.\n*[[Joe Lynch (actor)|Joe Lynch]] as Grundel Toad \u2013 a toad in love with Thumbelina\n*[[Gino Conforti]] as Jacquimo \u2013 a wise swallow who speaks with a French accent.

Devastated by the apparent loss of Cornelius, Thumbelina gives in to hopelessness and accepts Mr. Mole's proposal after some persuasion from Miss Fieldmouse. Thumbelina later visits Jacquimo and he revives,.  Refusing to believe Cornelius is dead, Jacquimo leaves to find him before the wedding.\n\nBeetle and Grundel find and abscond with Cornelius' frozen body and subsequently learn of Thumbelina's wedding. When they leave Cornelius behind and embark to Mr. Mole's home, a trio of friendly insects find and thaw Cornelius. At the wedding, Thumbelina finds herself unable to marry Mr. Mole after remembering Cornelius' promise to always love her. Grundel and Beetle suddenly appear and a chase ensues. Cornelius also appears and engages Grundel in a fight which culminates in the two falling into a chasm. Thumbelina escapes her pursuers and meets with Jacquimo, who has found the Vale of the Fairies and takes her there. Thumbelina and Cornelius reunite, and Thumbelina magically grows her own pair of wings upon accepting Cornelius' proposal. With Thumbelina\u2018s mother and the fairy court in attendance, the two marry and depart on Cornelius' bumblebee.\n\nMid-credits images reveal that Beetle's wings regrew and he resumed his pop career; Grundel survived the fall with a broken leg and married a female toad; and Mr. Mole married Miss Fieldmouse.\n\n==Voice cast==\n*[[Jodi Benson]] as [[Thumbelina]] \u2013 A tiny young woman who is not as big as her adoptive mother's thumb, and falls in love with the handsome fairy prince Cornelius.\n*[[Gary Imhoff]] as Prince Cornelius \u2013 the Prince of the Fairies and Thumbelina's love interest.\n*[[Joe Lynch (actor)|Joe Lynch]] as Grundel Toad \u2013 a toad in love with Thumbelina\n*[[Gino Conforti]] as Jacquimo \u2013 a wise swallow who speaks with a French accent.
