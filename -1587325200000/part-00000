Washington's mother is quoted as saying, \"Raymond was a good kid when he was a boy. Raymond didn't go out of his way to fight or do anything bad, but if someone came to him, he would protect himself. And he was well built. He tried to protect the community and keep the bad guys out.

Raymond was a bully. A muscular bully. He wouldn't let anybody from outside our neighborhood bother us. He would bother us. Raymond could be very mean.\"<ref name=laweekly.com/> A friend stated that Washington was a good [[American football|football]] player, but never participated as a member of school sports team due to his poor grades. Washington was repeatedly [[expulsion (academia)|expelled]] from schools resulting in frequent transfers, attending [[Locke High School]], [[John C. Fremont High School]], an [[alternative school]] attached to [[Washington Preparatory High School]], and [[Fairfax High School (Los Angeles)|Fairfax High School]] in the [[Fairfax District, Los Angeles|Fairfax District]] near [[West Hollywood, California|West Hollywood]].\n\n===Gang involvement===\nIn the late 1960s, there was an increase in [[Juvenile delinquency|youth crime]] in Los Angeles, particularly in and around South Central's [[Watts, Los Angeles|Watts]] neighborhood. Crime was especially prevalent in the three [[public housing|housing projects]] located in Watts, known as \"the Bricks\": [[Imperial Courts]], [[Nickerson Gardens]], and [[Jordan Downs]], where violent street [[robbery|robberies]] were common among adolescent criminals. Older [[African Americans|African-American]] street [[gang]]s in South Central like the Slausons, the Businessmen, and the Gladiators, had been ended by activist groups such as the [[Black Panther Party]] and the [[US Organization]]. The absence of the old gangs saw numerous new youth gangs begin to form in their place, including the Sportsmans Park, New House Boys, Acey Duecy, and Chain Gang, on West Side.\n\nWashington, a native of the East Side in his early teens during the rise of the gangs, joined a local street gang called The Avenues, led by another teenager named Craig Munson. At age 15, Washington beat up Munson's younger brother in fist fight after discovering Munson had put a gun to his older brother, Reggie Washington. After the fight, Washington and one of his other older brothers, Ronald Joe, confronted Munson on the corner of E 81st Street and Avalon Boulevard. According to former gang members who knew Washington at the time, he was subsequently beaten up by Craig Munson in retaliation for his younger brother's beating, and Washington left The Avenues. In late 1969, Washington organized his own gang called the Baby Avenues, recruiting a group of other neighborhood youths in South Central. The Baby Avenues wanted to emulate a gang of older youths called The Avenue Boys, which had been active since 1964 on Central Avenue.\n\n\n====Unification of South Central gangs====\nIn 1971, Washington approached [[Stanley Williams|Stanley \"Tookie\" Williams]], a similar gang leader from South Central's West Side who used his reputation as a fist fighter to unite gangs under his control, at Washington Preparatory High School where both were attending. Washington had heard of Williams through a mutual friend, who had informed Washington of Williams' toughness and his willingness to fight members of larger, more established street gangs such as the L.A. Brims and the Chain Gang. According to Williams' account of the meeting, what struck him about Washington was that, besides being incredibly muscular, he and his cohort were dressed similar to Williams and his clique, wearing leather jackets with starched [[Levi Strauss & Co.|Levi's]] jeans and suspenders. Washington proposed to Williams they form a [[confederation]] of the gangs under their influence in their respective areas along with another teenage gang leader called Mac Thomas in [[Compton, California|Compton]], to form a single large street gang. The proposal would see Williams' gangs adopt the Crip branding and would be allied with other Crip gangs outside of the West Side, but would retain ultimate leadership in the East Side. Williams accepted Washington's proposal, uniting the West Side gangs under his influence as the West Side Crips.\n\nThe Crips quickly established themselves as the largest street gang in Los Angeles, with increasing numbers and territory as their influence spread across low-income black neighborhoods. Washington, Williams and Thomas effectively held a [[monopoly]] on criminal activity in these areas, and became the dominant [[Boss (crime)|crime bosses]]. Street gangs that had resisted being absorbed into the Crips soon formed their own confederate alliance, the [[Bloods]], to protect their independence and their interests in the criminal market. The founding of the Bloods sparked an instant rivalry between the new large gangs that saw a surge in [[violent crime]] in Los Angeles, as neighboring Crip and Blood sets began using increasing violence to fight over territory and personal feuds. With the rise of [[News media in the United States|media]] coverage, which put these new violent gangs on the [[Newspaper|front page]], soon many disaffected black youths were running to join the Crips, many without ever being contacted by gang leaders. One story at the time stated:<ref name=lycos.com>{{cite web|title=Crips |publisher=Lycos.com |url=http://lycos.com/info/crips.html |accessdate=2008-01-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071228085102/http://www.lycos.com/info/crips.html |archivedate=December 28, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n{{quote|One of the gangs,  in the area is known as the Crips/ which started out at Washington High School as an [[extortion]] and [[terrorism|terror]] organization and spread to other schools where the gang members enrolled after being expelled from Washington, the police said.\n\nThe Police also said that this gang has been spreading \"like an octopus\" and now has members throughout South-Central Los Angeles, [[Inglewood, California|Inglewood]], [[Gardena, California|Gardena]], Compton, [[Lynwood, California|Lynwood]], [[Lancaster, California|Lancaster]], [[Palmdale, California|Palmdale]], the Firestone [unincorporated] area and the [[San Fernando Valley]].\n\nGang members, to identify themselves, wear black gloves on their left hands and gold-colored earrings in their left ears, which are pierced, according to police. They sometimes carry [[Walking stick|canes]], which they use as [[weapon]]s.\n\nThere are two stories circulating on the derivation of the word Crips. One is that it stands for a cripple, because some of the founders were injured and had to carry canes for a time. The other is that the founders once wore [[Afro]]-style hairdos and their parents made them \"crip it.\"{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}}}\n\nWithin a few years, much of the original Crip leadership were either imprisoned or dead. On February 23, 1973, Curtis \"Buddha\" Morrow, a close friend of Tookie Williams and a high-ranking Crip [[Mob enforcer|enforcer]], was shot to death in South Central following a petty argument. Mac Thomas was murdered under mysterious circumstances in the mid-1970s.\n\n==Robbery conviction==\nIn 1974, 21-year-old Washington was arrested for second-degree [[robbery]] and sentenced to five years' imprisonment at the [[Deuel Vocational Institution]] in [[Tracy, California|Tracy]], becoming the first Crip to be incarcerated there. Washington was unpopular among the prison population as he began to recruit young African-American inmates into the Crips, much to the disapproval of established black [[Prison gang|prison groups]] like the Black Muslims and the [[Black Guerrilla Family]]. According to a former inmate who was housed at Deuel with Washington, the Black Muslims and the Black Guerrilla Family were aware of the spread of the Crips in Los Angeles, and warned Washington that they would not tolerate the formation of Crips in the prison. Washington faced another problem while serving time at Deuel: as the Crips murdered rival gang members on the streets of Los Angeles, inmates at Deuel who were relatives of victims held Washington responsible for their deaths. Greg \"Batman\" Davis, a friend of Washington and an original Crips member, stated \"People in the prisons was losing their loved ones on the streets and because Raymond was the founder of the Crips, they blamed him for it. And since Raymond was the only Crip up there (at Deuel) at the time, they were trying to kill him.\"{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\nIn 1976, Washington paroled from prison and returned to Los Angeles. Reportedly, Washington was shocked to discover that the violent war between the Crips, Bloods, and [[Gangs in the United States|Hispanic gangs]] had escalated to the point that fighting using [[firearms]], as opposed to fist fighting, was now normal. Over the next few months, Washington became disillusioned with the Crips as the gang committed more violent and senseless crimes, with new recruits seeking to build their reputations.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} Since Washington's imprisonment, the organization had totally broken down into loosely-affiliated [[Decentralization|decentralized]] sets that often fought each other, as the Crips' original leadership had disappeared. Tookie Williams, the last remaining original Crips leader, served as the ''[[de facto]]'' leader during Washington's imprisonment. Williams had been injured in a [[drive-by shooting]] in 1976, and developed a growing addiction to [[Phencyclidine|PCP]] that caused his authority to wane until he was arrested for four counts of [[homicide]] shortly before Washington was murdered. According to [[law enforcement]], former gang members and close friends, Washington had decided that the Crips needed to be brought back under one [[umbrella organization]] to stop infighting, and then to work towards a [[truce]] with the Bloods.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} Upon realizing he no longer held influence in the gang, Washington started to distance himself from the Crips.\n\nRaymond Washington and Tookie killed 34 gang members of the bloods and said:\"Crips rule the world whoever is a blood that means he is dead\".Next week he murdered 3 other bloods for trying to kill him.He stabbed them and then shot one at the head while letting the others bleed out.He then was sentenced to 3 years in prison but got out because members of the crips killed all the officers there and got the keys and let him free.\n\n==Death==\nAt around 10:00 p.m. on August 9, 1979, twenty-five-year-old Washington was murdered in a [[drive-by shooting]] on the corner of E 64th Street and S San Pedro Street in South Central Los Angeles, and was rushed to [[Morningside Hospital (California)|Morningside Hospital]] where he died while undergoing emergency surgery.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} No suspects have been arrested, and Washington's murder remains unsolved. It was reported that Washington was hanging out on the corner when a car pulled up and the unidentified occupants called him over to the car. Washington's associates, as well as the police, were aware he would never walk up to cars of people that he did not know, and most likely knew the occupants of the vehicle as he told an acquaintance that he knew them. Washington engaged in a brief conversation with them before the occupant in the passenger seat drew a [[sawed-off shotgun]] and shot him in the [[abdomen]].{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of unsolved murders]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Washington, Raymond}}\n[[Category:1953 births]]\n[[Category:1979 deaths]]\n[[Category:1979 murders in the United States]]\n[[Category:American criminals]]\n[[Category:Gang members]]\n[[Category:Crips]]\n[[Category:Criminals of Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:History of Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Murdered African-American people]]\n[[Category:People murdered by African-American organized crime]]\n[[Category:Racism in the United States]]\n[[Category:Unsolved murders in the United States]]\n[[Category:People murdered in California]]\n[[Category:Deaths by firearm in California]]\n[[Category:American murder victims]]\n[[Category:John C.

McKillip]] and the first book of her [[Patricia A. McKillip bibliography#The Riddle-Master trilogy|Riddle Master trilogy]]. The novel and trilogy utilize themes from Celtic mythology.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n==Setting==\nIn a [[fantasy world]], the ruler of each land has a mystical awareness of his or her land called the land-rule. The seldom-seen High One presides over all. Riddles, typically questions about obscure pieces of lore, feature significantly, as well as [[shapeshifting]] magic.\n\n==Plot summary==\nThe titular Riddle-Master is Morgon, the Prince of Hed, a small, simple island populated by farmers and swineherds. The prince, inexplicably, has three stars on his forehead. \n\nMorgon's sister Tristan discovers that he keeps a crown hidden under his bed.

Lee filled in for [[Clive Bull]] for two weeks in late 2004, until he presented on Friday-Sunday 10{{nbsp}}pm to 1{{nbsp}}am.\n\nIn October 2005, Lee moved from weekends to the drivetime slot from 4{{nbsp}}pm to 7{{nbsp}}pm. Lee titled the show ''The 3 Hour 4 'Till 7 Iain Lee Afternoon Wireless Show.''. In January 2006, Lee moved again to 3{{nbsp}}pm to 6:30{{nbsp}}pm, with the show being renamed to ''The 3 and a Half Hour 3 'Till 6.30 Iain Lee Afternoon Wireless Show''.\n\nFor just over two years (9 September 2005 to 16 September 2007) Lee hosted \"Triple M\", a feature where calls go straight to air, live and unscreened. Other talk radio presenters have also hosted similar features, including [[Nick Abbot]], [[Tommy Boyd]] and [[Clive Bull]]. Initially, Lee would host the feature every Friday evening during the last half-hour of the show. Originally called \"Mental Mayhem\", it was renamed to \"Mick's Mental Mayhem\" (after a caller named Mick), then simply \"Triple M\". The rising popularity of the format, along with a change in show times in May 2006 led to Lee presenting a whole three-hour show on Sunday evenings from 10{{nbsp}}pm to 1{{nbsp}}am to Triple M, being called \"Sunday Night Triple M\", from 7 May 2006 to 16 September 2007. At the time, management favoured the unique format as they hoped that it would introduce exclusive listeners to the radio station.\n\nFrom January 2007 to his resignation in November, Lee presented the evening slot from 7{{nbsp}}pm to 10{{nbsp}}pm preceding Bull in the newly titled show, \"''Iain Lee's Good Evening''\". Lee chose the name after seeking advice from his friend and comedian [[Mackenzie Crook]]. The afternoon show was taken over by then weekend breakfast show host [[Paul Ross]].\n\nA change of radio station management (when [[Global Radio]] purchased LBC) in mid-2007 led to the demise of the Sunday Night Triple M show altogether, with the last show on 16 September 2007.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/nov/06/commercialradio.radio?gusrc=rss&feed=media | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Lee leaves LBC evening slot | first=John | last=Plunkett | date=6 November 2007 | accessdate=4 May 2010}}</ref> Lee's style of presenting fell out of favour with the new management, with returning topical and news-led conversation.

Lee filled in for [[Clive Bull]] for two weeks in late 2004, until he presented on Friday-Sunday 10{{nbsp}}pm to 1{{nbsp}}am.\n\nIn October 2005, Lee moved from weekends to the drivetime slot from 4{{nbsp}}pm to 7{{nbsp}}pm. Lee titled the show ''The 3 Hour 4 'Till 7 Iain Lee Afternoon Wireless Show.''. In January 2006, Lee moved again to 3{{nbsp}}pm to 6:30{{nbsp}}pm, with the show being renamed to ''The 3 and a Half Hour 3 'Till 6.30 Iain Lee Afternoon Wireless Show''.\n\nFor just over two years (9 September 2005 to 16 September 2007) Lee hosted \"Triple M\", a feature where calls go straight to air, live and unscreened. Other talk radio presenters have also hosted similar features, including [[Nick Abbot]], [[Tommy Boyd]] and [[Clive Bull]]. Initially, Lee would host the feature every Friday evening during the last half-hour of the show. Originally called \"Mental Mayhem\", it was renamed to \"Mick's Mental Mayhem\" (after a caller named Mick), then simply \"Triple M\". The rising popularity of the format, along with a change in show times in May 2006 led to Lee presenting a whole three-hour show on Sunday evenings from 10{{nbsp}}pm to 1{{nbsp}}am to Triple M, being called \"Sunday Night Triple M\", from 7 May 2006 to 16 September 2007. At the time, management favoured the unique format as they hoped that it would introduce exclusive listeners to the radio station.\n\nFrom January 2007 to his resignation in November, Lee presented the evening slot from 7{{nbsp}}pm to 10{{nbsp}}pm preceding Bull in the newly titled show, \"''Iain Lee's Good Evening''\". Lee chose the name after seeking advice from his friend and comedian [[Mackenzie Crook]]. The afternoon show was taken over by then weekend breakfast show host [[Paul Ross]].\n\nA change of radio station management (when [[Global Radio]] purchased LBC) in mid-2007 led to the demise of the Sunday Night Triple M show altogether, with the last show on 16 September 2007.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/nov/06/commercialradio.radio?gusrc=rss&feed=media | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Lee leaves LBC evening slot | first=John | last=Plunkett | date=6 November 2007 | accessdate=4 May 2010}}</ref> Lee's style of presenting fell out of favour with the new management, with returning topical and news-led conversation.

Listeners were also invited to interact with the show by sending [[AudioBoo]]s, to be included in the recording.\n\nThe podcast also included Lee interviewing guests and celebrity news with the Daily Express's Elisa Roche.\n\n===2012\u20132015: BBC Three Counties Radio and BBC WM===\n[[File:Next Radio 2015 (21274340969).jpg|left|upright|thumb|Lee in 2015]]\nBetween 2012 and 2015, Lee presented the breakfast radio show on [[BBC Three Counties Radio]], broadcast across Bedfordshire, Hertfordshire and Buckinghamshire from [[Luton]] and [[Dunstable]].

{"title_page": "African Israel Church Nineveh", "text_new": "The '''African Israel Church Nineveh''' is one of the largest [[African Initiated Church]]es in [[Kenya]].  The Church was founded by David Zakayo Kivuli, who belonged to a small clan which though integrated into [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] society was [[Nilotic]] in origin, being on the border of [[Luo people of Kenya and Tanzania|Luo]] and [[Luhya people|Luhya]] territory.  He grew up being friends to all and speaking [[Nandi languages|Nandi]] and Luo as well as his native [[Ragoli]].  The church has thus been able to draw membership from both Luo and Luhya.  Today the AINC followers are found in every large town in Kenya. Though the majority are members from two tribes, the Luhya and the Luo, the church has spread among many other tribes in the country. It has communities in the US and the UK, namely London.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oikoumene.org/gr/member-churches/regions/africa/kenya/african-israel-nineveh-church.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-22 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727142235/http://www.oikoumene.org/gr/member-churches/regions/africa/kenya/african-israel-nineveh-church.html |archivedate=2011-07-27 }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===The Background of David Zakayo Kivuli===\nSome 'freelance' Pentecostal missionaries had been working at Nyang'ori, on the border of the Luo and Luhya  territory since 1919, and this work gained increased impetus with the arrival of the Pentecostal Mission from [[Canada]] in 1924.  The Pentecostals preached a simple message of individual salvation with a moment of conversion with a subsequent 'receiving of the Spirit'.\n\nDavid Zakayo Kivuli was born about 1896 and came from a [[polygamous]] family living at Gimarakwa, only four mile from Nyang'ori.  He enrolled at Nyang'ori mission school during the First World War (in 1914) in order to avoid enlistment into the [[Carrier Corps]].<ref>Welbourn, F.B. and B.A. Ogot. A place to feel at home: a study of two independent churches in western Kenya. London: Oxford University Press, 1966.</ref>  He was later employed on a settler's farm, where he worked hard and married in 1921, and for the next four years worked as a labourer in various parts of Kenya.  This varied experience, together with some further education at the [[Jeanes School]] at [[Kabete]] ([[Nairobi]]), gave him a broad outlook which reached beyond tribal limitations, and a considerable knowledge, if also some suspicions, of European ways and thought. \n\nKivuli returned to study at the Pentecostal mission in Nyang'ori, where he was baptised in 1925.  In 1929 he was made mission supervisor of schools.  He returned for a short course at Kabete in 1931.  Late in 1931 he fell ill and following this illness was converted.  He began to prophesy and speak in tongues and performed miraculous cures. Many signs and wonders occurred, and his confession of sins and worship in public places which contradicted the teachings of the missionaries made it clear that he was not operating under the Pentecostal Church.<ref>Dictionary of African Historical Biography, 2nd edition, copyright \u00a9 1986, by Mark R. Lipschutz and R. Kent Rasmussen, University of California Press, Berkeley and Los Angeles, California. All rights reserved.</ref>\n\nDavid Kivuli died in 1974 and is buried in a mausoleum in his family compound next to the headquarters in Nineveh.\n\n===A Calling Like St Paul's===\nOn 6 February 1932 he became convinced for the first time that he was a sinner needing salvation, and on 12 February received the Spirit.  While singing in his house something lifted him up and threw him on the ground, and he became temporarily blind.  That night he began to speak with tongues, and the whole house was filled with light, but he remained blind for 16 days, and couldn't eat for 12 days.  During that time he heard a voice like thunder and God commanded him not to shave his beard and to take the name of Paul. \n\nWhen he recovered he had lost interest in teaching children and wanted to preach the Word of God, which he did by going from village to village, singing and converting people.  He prayed for the sick and they were healed. He was also joined by a group of Luo Anglicans who had received the spirit and been expelled from the church.  The leader of this group, Filemona Orwa, became a great friend of Kivuli's.  Kivuli was well respected both by the church and the government locally.\n\nDuring this time he had the confidence of both secular and ecclesiastical authorities.  From 1937 to 1943 he was a member of the Location Council, a position of some public responsibility.  From 1936 he was Chairman of the African Church Committee of the Pentecostal mission, and from 1939, an authorised evangelist Ogot. \n\nThe supernatural origin of his mission is also associated with a large rock near his home.  One day in 1941 while he and some followers were singing and praying, water came out of the rock.  The same happened the next day.  This confirmed his calling.  For many years he was ministering within his mother church.\n\nEventually he decided to form his own church and the separation from the [[Pentecostals]] was achieved without bitterness on either side.  It started with about 150 members.  Kivuli and his followers established a good reputation of being people who were 'loyal and harmless, pay taxes promptly, and are amenable to discipline\u2019.\n\n===The Founding of the New Church===\nThe new church was thus founded on 1 January 1942 out of the [[Pentecostal Assemblies of Canada]] at Nyang'ori.  It was initially called Huru Salvation Nineveh (Free Salvation Nineveh), but later became the African Israel Church Nineveh.  Kivuli, High Priest Zakayo &  Isaac Ajega (1962) The African Israel Church History presented at the Mindolo Consultation on African Independent Churches in 1962 points out that the church is called African not to be exclusive of other races, but to show that it was \"first founded, performed, ministered in Africa.\" Israel has the meaning of 'soldier of God' daily struggling against the enemy, and also 'God's plan of Salvation'.  It is called Nineveh because as the people of Nineveh repented, so the members are taught to repent and flee from the wickedness and evils of this world.\t\n\nThe church grew slowly in the first five years, but from 1949 the membership started to pick up.  Kivuli was able to preach in both Abaluhya and Dhluo so the church grew among both tribes.\n\n===A Distinctive Church===\n[[Polygamy]] was accepted at the time of entering the church, but a member was not allowed to take more wives.  Women, who outnumbered men two to one, were given an important place in the church.\n\nIt is customary for both men and women members to process to church in ankle length white dresses, accompanied with a flag and drum.  \"The practice of wearing long garments or gowns with head kerchiefs and turbans on the head of all, both females and males, is the indication that in [[Heaven]] we do not have sexual differences or physical bodies but we are all in the form of spiritual body, that immortal body of God; And as the [[Old Testament]] was the picture of shadow of the [[New Testament]], so the wearing by Israel adherents of almost the same and undistinguished dresses of both the body and the head is the shadow of the heavenly uniform.\"<ref>Kivuli, High Priest Zakayo &  Isaac Ajega (1962) The African Israel Church History presented at the Mindolo Consultation on African Independent Churches in 1962</ref>\n\nImmediately the church was founded the flag was introduced.  It indicates that the soldiers of the cross must have a national flag to show their regiment wherever they are.  The flag is green, white and red, representing the three major races of the world, Africans, Whites and Asians.  It also represents the Godhead of Father, Son and Holy Spirit.<ref>Kivuli, High Priest Zakayo &  Isaac Ajega (1962) The African Israel Church History presented at the Mindolo Consultation on African Independent Churches in 1962</ref>  It is used on parades outside the church.  These processions are to fish for sinners, thus fulfilling the Lord's command to go out and preach the gospel to every creature.\n\nThey sing and dance as they go in public witness to their faith.  The services are spontaneous with the leader very much in charge, and they follow a general pattern of prayer, exhortation, much noisy singing, and public confession leading to possession.  Spiritual healing is common, and dreams are regarded as an important part of revelation.\n\nProphecy is also very important.  \"The church believes strongly that all the people of God are spiritually inspired and that there are prophets, who can directly communicate with God in Spirit and to interpret the visions to the people.  That this is true means, God approaches or sends his wonderful message to his people, to reform his relationship of his glory to men of the world.\"<ref>Kivuli, High Priest Zakayo &  Isaac Ajega (1962) The African Israel Church History presented at the Mindolo Consultation on African Independent Churches in 1962</ref>  Dreams likewise have a very important place, as they do in tribal tradition to the extent that Kivuli states:  \"I am convinced that the only way in which God speaks to his children is through dreams.  There must be a biblical parallel.  Otherwise the dream is not from God.  But nothing important happens in the world which is not revealed to God's prophets.\" (Quoted in Welbourn, 1966<ref>Welbourn, F.B. and B.A. Ogot. A place to feel at home: a study of two independent churches in western Kenya. London: Oxford University Press, 1966.</ref>). It is important however to note the need for objectivity, through the scriptures, recognised by Kivuli, though not necessarily recognised by the rank and file members.\n\n===A Growing Church===\nThe church grew rapidly among the Luo and Luhya of western Kenya and spread into neighbouring Tanzania and Uganda. By 1970 Kivuli led perhaps 100,000 followers; his church had one hundred branches and was accepted as a probationary member of the National Christian Council of Kenya. \n\nAICN is now spread across [[Kenya]], and by 1973 was administered through 23 ministries under ministers (21 being in Kenya), with in turn 68 Pastorates each with a Pastor and 274 churches.<ref>Barrett, David et al (ed) (1973) Kenya Churches Handbook.  Evangel Publishing House, Kisumu, Kenya.</ref>  Kivuli died in 1974; in 1975 the Africa Israel Church Nineveh became an associate member church of the World Council of Churches.  AICN is an active member of the World Council of Churches, All Africa Council of Churches and the Organisation of African Instituted Churches (OAIC).\n\nThe local congregations have considerable autonomy, while having a strong bond of loyalty to the centre and the leader.  There is a strong moral obligation to pay an annual subscription which helps maintain the centre at Nineveh.  \n\nKeen members are expected to attend church twice a week.  On Fridays the service is for full members and is essentially one of confession and purification.  The Sunday service is one of thanksgiving for redemption into the saved community, and non members are encouraged to come and join in.\n===Divisions and new Churches===\nAICN has suffered from many divisions from it over the years.  In 1950 the Muolo Roho Israel Church, founded by Bishop Yona Atiang, split form the AICN over [[food taboos]].  The bishop and his deputy inform the congregations concerning prohibited meats.  Muolo means peacefulness in Dholuo.<ref>Barrett, David B. Schism and renewal in Africa. Nairobi: Oxford University Press, 1968.</ref>\n\nThe Muolo Roho Israel Church has removed the physical from sacraments.  Baptism does not involve the use of water but is effected by the sign of the cross, and an anointing oil is added to the ceremony.  Holy Communion is celebrated with a scripture reading, no food being necessary since Jesus already gave his body on the cross for the faithful.\n\nA second split forming the [[Roho Israel Church of God]] took place in 1963.  In 1960, the founder, Mr James Kasibo, who was formerly of the Pentecostal Assemblies of God and later of AICN, had a serious illness accompanied by a vision.  As a result he led a 'reform Israel' movement of AICN and formed a church which was first known as African Spiritual Israel Church, then World Spiritual Israel Church (Roho Mtakatifu Israel Church and Schools).  From 1966 it has been known as Roho Israel Church of God.\n\nIn 1962, Mr Paul Omumbo Achola split from the AICN, and eventually in 1970 set up his own body under Luo leadership, supported generously from his own resources.  The church is called New Roho Israel Church (Manyien).  Manyien mean 'New' in Dhluo.\n\nIn 1965 an independent group of Luo and Luhya members split off from the RICG in a dispute over leadership to form the East African Church Roho Israel.  Its headquarters is at Ahero.\n\nAlso in 1965 Bishop Paulo Masambu led a split from AICN, to form the Sinai Church of East Africa, stressing the need for more educated leadership training.  In 1971 it had only grown slowly with 300 Luhya and 50 Kikuyu members (Barrett et al., 1973).\n\nAnother schism in 1965 from the AICN led by Rev Stephen John Khaguli in dispute over leadership led in 1966 to the registration of the Three Holiness Church of Kenya, but its registration was cancelled in 1970.\n\n==Church structure==\nIn the AINC the spouse of every church leader is co-leader and the two are ordained together. The administrative and spiritual line begins with the church elder in every local church, a pastor in charge of a pastorate, a senior minister in charge of a centre, a chief minister in charge of a region or division, a moderator or missionary bishop in charge of a central regional office or province, a national bishop in charge of a country and the archbishop as the spiritual head.\n===Headquarters===\nThe Headquarters is at Jebrok in [[Hamisi Constituency]] in [[Western Province (Kenya)|Western Province]], [[Kenya]]. The spiritual head of the church resides at Nineveh headquarters where a large church was built in 1958, called Safina or \"The Ark\".  When David Kivuli died in 1974 he was succeeded as spiritual head by the high priestess Mama Rebecca Kivuli, who retired in 1983.  The present Archbishop is David Kivuli\u2019s grandson, Archbishop John Kivuli II.\n===Church departments and Educational Activities===\nAt the beginning, the AINC faced many difficulties as an independent church in Kenya. Now it operates more than thirty primary schools and sixty nursery schools. Various women's groups are responsible for education in home economics and handicraft. \n\nThe church has various departments and programmes catering for the needs of the youth, recreational activities, women, men, small-scale businesses, mission, evangelism, health, development, legal and human resources, HIV/AIDS programmes, education, counselling services, etc.\n\n==Doctrine and beliefs==\nThe AINC holds the Trinitarian doctrine, and believes in the second coming of Jesus Christ and his final judgment. The church does not practise [[infant baptism]]. Infants are dedicated on their eighth day by the local pastor and given Christian names by their parents or guardians. Adult baptism is done after attending baptism classes for three months. It is considered as baptism of the Spirit and is done without water. This does not imply that water as a means of baptism is bad or prohibited. The AINC offers opportunities for water baptism to any member who asks for it.\n\n===Holy days===\nIn the tradition of the AINC, Friday is the day for repentance and is also celebrated as the holy day when the church remembers the death of Jesus Christ on the cross and his forgiveness of sins. Long sessions of prayer and meditation take place on this day. \n\nSunday is also a holy day, mostly celebrated by processions.\n\n===Ethics===\nIn the realm of Christian ethics, all members are expected to practice monogamy, abstinence from alcohol and tobacco, and adopt simple styles of dress.\n\n===Distinctive practices===\nKitagawa (1962) lists four points on which he says the AICN has deviated from Protestant orthodoxy:\n* The weekly day of worship is Friday, while Sunday is the day of preaching outside of the Church.\n* Rejection of water in baptism for fear the use of water leads to formalism at the expense of the part played by the Holy Spirit.\n* Rejection of Holy Communion, and sole emphasis on repentance as the mark of salvation.\n* Baptism of the polygamously married converts without their forsaking the second wife.\nThese four points, therefore probably give a clear idea of some of the issues missionaries can learn from the churches and how they themselves are perceived.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{coord missing|Kenya}}\n\n[[Category:Churches in Kenya]]\n", "text_old": "The '''African Israel Church Nineveh''' is one of the largest [[African Initiated Church]]es in [[Kenya]].

Spiritual healing is common, and dreams are regarded as an important part of revelation.\n\nProphecy is also very important.  \"The church believes strongly that all the people of God are spiritually inspired and that there are prophets, who can directly communicate with God in Spirit and to interpret the visions to the people.  That this is true means, God approaches or sends his wonderful message to his people, to reform his relationship of his glory to men of the world.\"<ref>Kivuli, High Priest Zakayo &  Isaac Ajega (1962) The African Israel Church History presented at the Mindolo Consultation on African Independent Churches in 1962</ref>  Dreams likewise have a very important place, as they do in tribal tradition to the extent that Kivuli states:  \"I am convinced that the only way in which God speaks to his children is through dreams.  There must be a biblical parallel.  Otherwise the dream is not from God.  But nothing important happens in the world which is not revealed to God's prophets.\" (Quoted in Welbourn, 1966<ref>Welbourn, F.B. and B.A. Ogot. A place to feel at home: a study of two independent churches in western Kenya. London: Oxford University Press, 1966.</ref>). It is important however to note the need for objectivity, through the scriptures, recognised by Kivuli, though not necessarily recognised by the rank and file members.\n\n===A Growing Church===\nThe church grew rapidly among the Luo and Luhya of western Kenya and spread into neighbouring Tanzania and Uganda. By 1970 Kivuli led perhaps 100,000 followers; his church had one hundred branches and was accepted as a probationary member of the National Christian Council of Kenya. \n\nAICN is now spread across [[Kenya]], and by 1973 was administered through 23 ministries under ministers (21 being in Kenya), with in turn 68 Pastorates each with a Pastor and 274 churches.<ref>Barrett, David et al (ed) (1973) Kenya Churches Handbook.  Evangel Publishing House, Kisumu, Kenya.</ref>  Kivuli died in 1974; in 1975 the Africa Israel Church Nineveh became an associate member church of the World Council of Churches.  AICN is an active member of the World Council of Churches, All Africa Council of Churches and the Organisation of African Instituted Churches (OAIC).\n\nThe local congregations have considerable autonomy, while having a strong bond of loyalty to the centre and the leader.  There is a strong moral obligation to pay an annual subscription which helps maintain the centre at Nineveh.  \n\nKeen members are expected to attend church twice a week.  On Fridays the service is for full members and is essentially one of confession and purification.  The Sunday service is one of thanksgiving for redemption into the saved community, and non members are encouraged to come and join in.\n===Divisions and new Churches===\nAICN has suffered from many divisions from it over the years.  In 1950 the Muolo Roho Israel Church, founded by Bishop Yona Atiang, split form the AICN over [[food taboos]].  The bishop and his deputy inform the congregations concerning prohibited meats.  Muolo means peacefulness in Dholuo.<ref>Barrett, David B. Schism and renewal in Africa. Nairobi: Oxford University Press, 1968.</ref>\n\nThe Muolo Roho Israel Church has removed the physical from sacraments.  Baptism does not involve the use of water but is effected by the sign of the cross, and an anointing oil is added to the ceremony.  Holy Communion is celebrated with a scripture reading, no food being necessary since Jesus already gave his body on the cross for the faithful.\n\nA second split forming the [[Roho Israel Church of God]] took place in 1963.  In 1960, the founder, Mr James Kasibo, who was formerly of the Pentecostal Assemblies of God and later of AICN, had a serious illness accompanied by a vision.  As a result he led a 'reform Israel' movement of AICN and formed a church which was first known as African Spiritual Israel Church, then World Spiritual Israel Church (Roho Mtakatifu Israel Church and Schools).  From 1966 it has been known as Roho Israel Church of God.\n\nIn 1962, Mr Paul Omumbo Achola split from the AICN, and eventually in 1970 set up his own body under Luo leadership, supported generously from his own resources.  The church is called New Roho Israel Church (Manyien).  Manyien mean 'New' in Dhluo.\n\nIn 1965 an independent group of Luo and Luhya members split off from the RICG in a dispute over leadership to form the East African Church Roho Israel.  Its headquarters is at Ahero.\n\nAlso in 1965 Bishop Paulo Masambu led a split from AICN, to form the Sinai Church of East Africa, stressing the need for more educated leadership training.  In 1971 it had only grown slowly with 300 Luhya and 50 Kikuyu members (Barrett et al., 1973).\n\nAnother schism in 1965 from the AICN led by Rev Stephen John Khaguli in dispute over leadership led in 1966 to the registration of the Three Holiness Church of Kenya, but its registration was cancelled in 1970.\n\n==Church structure==\nIn the AINC the spouse of every church leader is co-leader and the two are ordained together. The administrative and spiritual line begins with the church elder in every local church, a pastor in charge of a pastorate, a senior minister in charge of a centre, a chief minister in charge of a region or division, a moderator or missionary bishop in charge of a central regional office or province, a national bishop in charge of a country and the archbishop as the spiritual head.\n===Headquarters===\nThe Headquarters is at Jebrok in [[Hamisi Constituency]] in [[Western Province (Kenya)|Western Province]], [[Kenya]]. The spiritual head of the church resides at Nineveh headquarters where a large church was built in 1958, called Safina or \"The Ark\".  When David Kivuli died in 1974 he was succeeded as spiritual head by the high priestess Mama Rebecca Kivuli, who retired in 1983.  The present Archbishop is David Kivuli\u2019s grandson, Archbishop John Kivuli II.\n===Church departments and Educational Activities===\nAt the beginning, the AINC faced many difficulties as an independent church in Kenya. Now it operates more than thirty primary schools and sixty nursery schools. Various women's groups are responsible for education in home economics and handicraft. \n\nThe church has various departments and programmes catering for the needs of the youth, recreational activities, women, men, small-scale businesses, mission, evangelism, health, development, legal and human resources, HIV/AIDS programmes, education, counselling services, etc.\n\n==Doctrine and beliefs==\nThe AINC holds the Trinitarian doctrine, and believes in the second coming of Jesus Christ and his final judgment. The church does not practise [[infant baptism]]. Infants are dedicated on their eighth day by the local pastor and given Christian names by their parents or guardians. Adult baptism is done after attending baptism classes for three months. It is considered as baptism of the Spirit and is done without water. This does not imply that water as a means of baptism is bad or prohibited. The AINC offers opportunities for water baptism to any member who asks for it.\n\n===Holy days===\nIn the tradition of the AINC, Friday is the day for repentance and is also celebrated as the holy day when the church remembers the death of Jesus Christ on the cross and his forgiveness of sins. Long sessions of prayer and meditation take place on this day. \n\nSunday is also a holy day, mostly celebrated by processions.\n\n===Ethics===\nIn the realm of Christian ethics, all members are expected to practice monogamy, abstinence from alcohol and tobacco, and adopt simple styles of dress.\n\n===Distinctive practices===\nKitagawa (1962) lists four points on which he says the AICN has deviated from Protestant orthodoxy:\n* The weekly day of worship is Friday, while Sunday is the day of preaching outside of the Church.\n* Rejection of water in baptism for fear the use of water leads to formalism at the expense of the part played by the Holy Spirit.\n* Rejection of Holy Communion, and sole emphasis on repentance as the mark of salvation.\n* Baptism of the polygamously married converts without their forsaking the second wife.\nThese four points, therefore probably give a clear idea of some of the issues missionaries can learn from the churches and how they themselves are perceived.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{coord missing|Kenya}}\n\n[[Category:Churches in Kenya]]\n", "name_user": "Illegitimate Barrister", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eA Distinctive Church", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Israel_Church_Nineveh"}
