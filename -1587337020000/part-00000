Broadcast on many of the major digital television platforms in the UK, Tiny Pop, which was launched on 8 September 2003 as Pop Plus, and shows, its target audience is children aged 7 and under.<ref name=TinyPop>{{cite web |url=http://cscmediagroup.com/showreels/322/Tiny-Pop |title=Tiny Pop |publisher=CSC Media Group |accessdate=1 June 2014}}</ref> The station broadcasts principally animated content sourced from various distributors.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Pop Plus logo.png|200px|thumb|right|Logo as Pop Plus used from 8 September 2003 to 27 July 2004]] [[File:Tiny Pop 2011 logo.png|200px|thumb|right|Tiny Pop logo used from 2011 to 2 September 2018]]\nThe channel began on 8 September 2003 as Pop Plus (stylized on-screen as p\u2295p), a secondary service to Pop. The channel was licensed to air animation and music, it operated the same broadcast hours as its sister channel (6am to 8pm at the time; Pop later expanded to its current 24-hour service) and was not a direct timeshift of its sibling, instead offering an alternative mix of the channel's content. (At one point the arrangement was that whilst Pop was showing music Pop Plus would show cartoons, and vice versa, but this was not always the case). On 27 July 2004, it was relaunched as '''Tiny Pop''', which allowed the main Pop to refocus on slightly older children and reduce its use of preschooler shows.\n\nAs with other CSC channels, on-screen presenters are rarely used: programmes are introduced either by caption and voiceover alone, or  through animated characters. For a time during the mid-2000s (decade), a group of animated monkeys, known as the ''Cheeky Monkeys'', would talk about cartoons, read out jokes from viewers and show artwork; from the end of June 2009, they were replaced with 3 new hosts, Molly, Leo and Pip (who are also monkeys).\n\nTiny Pop initially broadcast on satellite TV - [[Sky (UK & Ireland)|Sky]] (now channel 617) from the channel's launch, and [[Freesat]] (channel 605) from the launch of the platform in 2008.\n\nOn 11 October 2007, Tiny Pop was launched on [[Virgin Media]], along with its sister channel Pop. Pop was removed in 2011, but was brought back on 25 August 2016.

On 7 January 2015, Tiny Pop was launched fully on DTT and as from 15 March 2017, is now broadcast 24 hours a day on Freeview. Round-the-clock service continues on satellite and cable.\n\nPrior to January 2015, the channel had broadcast billed programmes from 0600 to 2230, teleshopping content from 2230 to 0130, and a 'Through the Night' programming block from 0130 to 0600. From 1 January 2015, the schedule changed to run billed content from 0600 to 0000, with 'Through the Night' for the remaining six hours, with the teleshopping block dropped; sister channel POP had also removed its prior teleshopping block ahead of its move onto Freeview. Also sister channel Pop shown Tiny Pop programmes on their channel, until February 2015.\n\nOn 15 March 2017, Tiny Pop changed its service on Freeview, moving to the Local Television multiplexes across the UK, meaning that the channel is only available on Freeview where a local television service (e.g. [[Made in Cardiff]]) is broadcast.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tiny Pop available on Local Freeview channel 126|url=http://www.tinypop.com/special/tiny-pop-tv|website=TinyPop.com|accessdate=15 March 2017}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|http://www.tinypop.com}}\n\n{{Children's channels in UK & Ireland}}\n{{Chart Show Channels}}\n{{Media in the United Kingdom|television}}\n{{Freeview}}\n\n[[Category:CSC Media Group]]\n[[Category:Children's television channels in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:English-language television stations in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Television channels and stations established in 2003]]\n[[Category:Television channels in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Sony Pictures Television]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|British children's television channel}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2014}}\n{{Use British English|date=February 2014}}\n{{refimprove|date=September 2014}}\n{{Infobox TV channel\n| name = Tiny Pop\n| logofile = New Tiny Pop Logo 2018.png\n| launch = {{start date and age|8 September 2003}}\n| share = 0.23%<br>0.02% (+1)\n| share as of = {{Start date|df=yes|2018|08}}\n| share source = BARB<ref>[http://www.barb.co.uk/whats-new/monthly-viewing-summary?_s=4] </ref>\n| picture format = [[576i]] [[16:9]] [[SDTV]]\n| owner = [[Sony Pictures Television]]\n| former names = Pop Plus (2003-2004)\n| country = [[United Kingdom]]\n| language = [[English language|English]]\n| sister names = [[Pop (British and Irish TV channel)|Pop]]<br>[[Pop Max]]<br>[[Sony Channel (UK and Ireland)|Sony Channel]]<br>[[Sony Crime Channel]]<br>[[Sony Movies]]<br>[[Sony Movies Action]]<br>[[Sony Movies Classic]]\n| web = [http://www.tinypop.com Tinypop.com]\n| terr serv 1 = [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]]\n| terr chan 1 = Channel 207<br>Channel 210 (+1)\n| sat serv 1 = [[Freesat]]\n| sat chan 1 = Channel 605<br>Channel 609 (+1)\n| sat serv 2 = [[Sky UK|Sky]]\n| sat chan 2 = Channel 617<br>Channel 624 (+1)\n| sat serv 3 = [[Astra 2F]]<br>([[Astra 28.2\u00b0E|28.2\u00b0E]])\n| sat chan 3 = 11306 V 27500 5/6<br>11306 V 27500 5/6 (+1)\n| cable serv 1 = [[WightFibre]]\n| cable chan 1 = Channel 104\n| cable serv 2 = [[Virgin Media]] <small>(UK)</small>\n| cable chan 2 = Channel 737\n| cable serv 3 = [[TalkTalk TV|TalkTalk]]\n| cable chan 3 = Channel 403<br>Channel 412 (+1)\n| online serv 1 = [[FilmOn]]\n| online chan 1 = [[Internet Protocol Television]]\n| online serv 2 = [[Sky Go]]\n| online serv 3 = Virgin TV Anywhere\n}}\n\n'''Tiny Pop''' is a [[free-to-air]] children's [[television channel]] in the [[United Kingdom]], owned by [[Sony Pictures Television]]. Broadcast on many of the major digital television platforms in the UK, Tiny Pop, which was launched on 8 September 2003 as Pop Plus, and shows, its target audience is children aged 7 and under.<ref name=TinyPop>{{cite web |url=http://cscmediagroup.com/showreels/322/Tiny-Pop |title=Tiny Pop |publisher=CSC Media Group |accessdate=1 June 2014}}</ref> The station broadcasts principally animated content sourced from various distributors.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Pop Plus logo.png|200px|thumb|right|Logo as Pop Plus used from 8 September 2003 to 27 July 2004]] [[File:Tiny Pop 2011 logo.png|200px|thumb|right|Tiny Pop logo used from 2011 to 2 September 2018]]\nThe channel began on 8 September 2003 as Pop Plus (stylized on-screen as p\u2295p), a secondary service to Pop. The channel was licensed to air animation and music, it operated the same broadcast hours as its sister channel (6am to 8pm at the time; Pop later expanded to its current 24-hour service) and was not a direct timeshift of its sibling, instead offering an alternative mix of the channel's content. (At one point the arrangement was that whilst Pop was showing music Pop Plus would show cartoons, and vice versa, but this was not always the case). On 27 July 2004, it was relaunched as '''Tiny Pop''', which allowed the main Pop to refocus on slightly older children and reduce its use of preschooler shows.\n\nAs with other CSC channels, on-screen presenters are rarely used: programmes are introduced either by caption and voiceover alone, or  through animated characters. For a time during the mid-2000s (decade), a group of animated monkeys, known as the ''Cheeky Monkeys'', would talk about cartoons, read out jokes from viewers and show artwork; from the end of June 2009, they were replaced with 3 new hosts, Molly, Leo and Pip (who are also monkeys).\n\nTiny Pop initially broadcast on satellite TV - [[Sky (UK & Ireland)|Sky]] (now channel 617) from the channel's launch, and [[Freesat]] (channel 605) from the launch of the platform in 2008.\n\nOn 11 October 2007, Tiny Pop was launched on [[Virgin Media]], along with its sister channel Pop. Pop was removed in 2011, but was brought back on 25 August 2016. The station has also been made available over other cable systems.\n\nOn 14 July 2016, Tiny Pop +1 was temporarily replaced by Pop Max. The channel aired back-to-back episodes of a show from [[Pop (UK and Ireland)|POP]]. Tiny Pop +1 returned on 1 December 2016.

On 7 January 2015, Tiny Pop was launched fully on DTT and as from 15 March 2017, is now broadcast 24 hours a day on Freeview. Round-the-clock service continues on satellite and cable.\n\nPrior to January 2015, the channel had broadcast billed programmes from 0600 to 2230, teleshopping content from 2230 to 0130, and a 'Through the Night' programming block from 0130 to 0600. From 1 January 2015, the schedule changed to run billed content from 0600 to 0000, with 'Through the Night' for the remaining six hours, with the teleshopping block dropped; sister channel POP had also removed its prior teleshopping block ahead of its move onto Freeview. Also sister channel Pop shown Tiny Pop programmes on their channel, until February 2015.\n\nOn 15 March 2017, Tiny Pop changed its service on Freeview, moving to the Local Television multiplexes across the UK, meaning that the channel is only available on Freeview where a local television service (e.g. [[Made in Cardiff]]) is broadcast.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tiny Pop available on Local Freeview channel 126|url=http://www.tinypop.com/special/tiny-pop-tv|website=TinyPop.com|accessdate=15 March 2017}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|http://www.tinypop.com}}\n\n{{Children's channels in UK & Ireland}}\n{{Chart Show Channels}}\n{{Media in the United Kingdom|television}}\n{{Freeview}}\n\n[[Category:CSC Media Group]]\n[[Category:Children's television channels in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:English-language television stations in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Television channels and stations established in 2003]]\n[[Category:Television channels in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Sony Pictures Television]]\n", "name_user": "Shoeouser", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eProgramming segments", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiny_Pop"}

The first was conceived and inaugurated in 1937 by [[John Buchan, 1st Baron Tweedsmuir|the Lord Tweedsmuir]], a prolific writer of fiction and non-fiction; he created the [[Governor General's Literary Award]] with two award categories. Successive governors general have followed suit, establishing an award for whichever endeavour they personally found important. Only [[Adrienne Clarkson]] created three Governor General's Awards: the Governor General's Award in Visual and Media Arts, the Governor General's Northern Medal, and the Governor General's Medal in Architecture (though this was effectively a continuation of the Massey Medal, first established in 1950).\n\n==Governor General's Literary Awards==\nInaugurated in 1937 for 1936 publications in two categories, the Governor General's Literary Awards have become one of Canada's most prestigious prizes. Since 1987 there are fourteen awards,<ref name=ogwc-GG/> recognizing both [[French language|French]] and [[English language]] work in seven categories: [[fiction]], [[non-fiction]], [[poetry]], [[drama]], [[children's literature]] (one each for text and illustration), and [[translation]]. The program was created by [[John Buchan, 1st Baron Tweedsmuir|the Lord Tweedsmuir]]\u2014John Buchan, author of ''[[The Thirty-Nine Steps]]''. Initially there were only two awards, for fiction and non-fiction books, and the program honoured only English-language works before 1959 (although the awards were occasionally won by English translations of works originally published in French).<ref name=ogwc-GG/> The [[Stephen Leacock Memorial Medal for Humour|Stephen Leacock Award]] for humor literature, while administered separately from the Governor General's Awards and presented to the winners at a separate ceremony, made its initial announcements of award winners as part of the Governor General's Awards announcements in this era.<ref name=lowers>\"Prof. Lower's History Gets Vice-Regal Award\".

By 1980, the council began to announce the finalists for the awards a month before they were presented, in order to attract more media attention, and, in 2007, the cash prize was increased to $25,000.\n\nPrior to [[Adrienne Clarkson]]'s time as governor general, the collection of Governor General's Literary Award-winning books at [[Rideau Hall]] was lacking more than 25 per cent of the full collection.<ref name=Barrett>{{cite journal| last=Barrett| first=Maurie| title=The Great Hunt for Governor General's Literary Award Winners| journal=Amphora| issue=144| publisher=[[Alcuin Society]]| location=Vancouver| date=October 2006| url=http://www.alcuinsociety.com/amphora/144/RideauHall.html| accessdate=23 February 2009| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725031905/http://www.alcuinsociety.com/amphora/144/RideauHall.html| archivedate=25 July 2008}}</ref> Clarkson made an effort to obtain from fairs and second hand shops the missing copies for the governor general's study and, when she left the viceregal office in 2005, the complete collection of winning books to date had been amassed.<ref name=Barrett/> It reached 552 books by late 2006<ref name=Barrett/> and was moved to Rideau Hall's library.<ref>{{cite AV media| people=Christie-Luff, Catherine; Clark, Catherine| title=Rideau Hall \u2013 Inside Canada's House| medium=Digital video| publisher=CPAC| location=Ottawa| date=2014| url=http://www.cpac.ca/en/programs/documentaries/episodes/35927082/| url-status=live| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303232712/http://www.cpac.ca/en/programs/documentaries/episodes/35927082/| archivedate=2016-03-03}}</ref> Today it forms the only complete collection of Governor General's Literary Award winners in existence.<ref name=Barrett/>\n\n==Governor General's Medals in Architecture==\nThe Governor General's Medals in [[Architecture]] have been presented since 1982, continuing the tradition of the Massey Medals, which had been awarded between 1950 and 1970.

The first was conceived and inaugurated in 1937 by [[John Buchan, 1st Baron Tweedsmuir|the Lord Tweedsmuir]], a prolific writer of fiction and non-fiction; he created the [[Governor General's Literary Award]] with two award categories. Successive governors general have followed suit, establishing an award for whichever endeavour they personally found important. Only [[Adrienne Clarkson]] created three Governor General's Awards: the Governor General's Award in Visual and Media Arts, the Governor General's Northern Medal, and the Governor General's Medal in Architecture (though this was effectively a continuation of the Massey Medal, first established in 1950).\n\n==Governor General's Literary Awards==\nInaugurated in 1937 for 1936 publications in two categories, the Governor General's Literary Awards have become one of Canada's most prestigious prizes. Since 1987 there are fourteen awards,<ref name=ogwc-GG/> recognizing both [[French language|French]] and [[English language]] work in seven categories: [[fiction]], [[non-fiction]], [[poetry]], [[drama]], [[children's literature]] (one each for text and illustration), and [[translation]]. The program was created by [[John Buchan, 1st Baron Tweedsmuir|the Lord Tweedsmuir]]\u2014John Buchan, author of ''[[The Thirty-Nine Steps]]''. Initially there were only two awards, for fiction and non-fiction books, and the program honoured only English-language works before 1959 (although the awards were occasionally won by English translations of works originally published in French).<ref name=ogwc-GG/> The [[Stephen Leacock Memorial Medal for Humour|Stephen Leacock Award]] for humor literature, while administered separately from the Governor General's Awards and presented to the winners at a separate ceremony, made its initial announcements of award winners as part of the Governor General's Awards announcements in this era.<ref name=lowers>\"Prof. Lower's History Gets Vice-Regal Award\".

By 1980, the council began to announce the finalists for the awards a month before they were presented, in order to attract more media attention, and, in 2007, the cash prize was increased to $25,000.\n\nPrior to [[Adrienne Clarkson]]'s time as governor general, the collection of Governor General's Literary Award-winning books at [[Rideau Hall]] was lacking more than 25 per cent of the full collection.<ref name=Barrett>{{cite journal| last=Barrett| first=Maurie| title=The Great Hunt for Governor General's Literary Award Winners| journal=Amphora| issue=144| publisher=[[Alcuin Society]]| location=Vancouver| date=October 2006| url=http://www.alcuinsociety.com/amphora/144/RideauHall.html| accessdate=23 February 2009| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725031905/http://www.alcuinsociety.com/amphora/144/RideauHall.html| archivedate=25 July 2008}}</ref> Clarkson made an effort to obtain from fairs and second hand shops the missing copies for the governor general's study and, when she left the viceregal office in 2005, the complete collection of winning books to date had been amassed.<ref name=Barrett/> It reached 552 books by late 2006<ref name=Barrett/> and was moved to Rideau Hall's library.<ref>{{cite AV media| people=Christie-Luff, Catherine; Clark, Catherine| title=Rideau Hall \u2013 Inside Canada's House| medium=Digital video| publisher=CPAC| location=Ottawa| date=2014| url=http://www.cpac.ca/en/programs/documentaries/episodes/35927082/| url-status=live| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303232712/http://www.cpac.ca/en/programs/documentaries/episodes/35927082/| archivedate=2016-03-03}}</ref> Today it forms the only complete collection of Governor General's Literary Award winners in existence.<ref name=Barrett/>\n\n==Governor General's Medals in Architecture==\nThe Governor General's Medals in [[Architecture]] have been presented since 1982, continuing the tradition of the Massey Medals, which had been awarded between 1950 and 1970.

The grand Georgian Revival-style structure was featured in 1907 in Home and Garden magazine along with its formal gardens, which are still meticulously maintained to this day. / Airlie House met tragedy in 1924 as it was destroyed in a fire. Groome rebuilt the house on its original foundation, but reduced it from three to two stories. / When Dr. Head purchased Airlie Farm in 1956, he laid down the foundation for the course of the structure for the next 50 years. Dr. Head had a vision of creating one of the first conference facilities of its kind in the country. He wanted a place where individuals and organizations could meet in a distraction-free, neutral environment to openly exchange ideas and share opinions on important matters of the day. The purpose, of course, was to ignite thought and inspire collective action. / The development of Dr. Head's vision was a success. He integrated modern meeting facilities and accommodations with the lush, natural setting of the Airlie estate. In 1961, [[Airlie Center]] opened its doors and Life Magazine declared it an innovative \"Island of Thought.\" / With this innovative platform, Dr. Head initiated a variety of programs dedicated to education, environmental research, public health, and social progress. During the Civil Rights Movement, Dr. Head established [[Airlie Center]] as a safe zone for dialogue. [[Airlie Productions]], Dr. Head's studio facilities based at Airlie Center, created hundreds of documentaries on the full spectrum of social and environmental issues and received more than 20 Emmy awards recognizing 20 years of work. / Today, Airlie remains committed to its founding ideals of environmental stewardship and the open exchange of ideas in a distraction-free setting. / Airlie, a member of Historic Hotels of America since 2015, dates back to 1899.\"\n*[[Williamsburg Inn]], Williamsburg, Virginia\n*[[Williamsburg Lodge, Autograph Collection, and Colonial Houses]], Williamsburg, Virginia\n\n==Washington==\n*[[Mayflower Park Hotel]] (1927), Seattle, Washington.

Groome rebuilt the house on its original foundation, but reduced it from three to two stories. / When Dr. Head purchased Airlie Farm in 1956, he laid down the foundation for the course of the structure for the next 50 years. Dr. Head had a vision of creating one of the first conference facilities of its kind in the country. He wanted a place where individuals and organizations could meet in a distraction-free, neutral environment to openly exchange ideas and share opinions on important matters of the day. The purpose, of course, was to ignite thought and inspire collective action. / The development of Dr. Head's vision was a success. He integrated modern meeting facilities and accommodations with the lush, natural setting of the Airlie estate. In 1961, [[Airlie Center]] opened its doors and Life Magazine declared it an innovative \"Island of Thought.\" / With this innovative platform, Dr. Head initiated a variety of programs dedicated to education, environmental research, public health, and social progress.

There were few advocates for decolonisation of Hong Kong from the British rule during the post-war period, notably [[Ma Man-fai]] and the [[Democratic Self-Government Party of Hong Kong]] in the 1960s but the fruitless movement ceased to exist without substantial support.\n\nIn the last years of the 1970s into the early 1980s, the question of Hong Kong sovereignty emerged on Hong Kong's political scene as the end of the New Territories lease was approaching. Hong Kong and [[Macau]] were both removed from the [[United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories]], in which territories on the list would have the right to be independent, on 2 November 1972 by request of the People's Republic of China (PRC). Although there were advocates for Hong Kong independence, the majority of the Hong Kong population, many of whom were political, economic or war refugees from the [[Chinese Civil War]] and the Communist regime on the mainland China, wished to maintain the status quo. The request for a Hong Kong representative in the Sino-British negotiation was rejected by Beijing. In 1984, the British and Chinese governments signed the [[Sino-British Joint Declaration]] which stated that the sovereignty of Hong Kong should be transferred to the PRC on 1 July 1997, and Hong Kong should enjoy a \"high degree of autonomy\" under the \"[[One Country, Two Systems]]\" principle.\n\nFrom 1983 to 1997, Hong Kong saw an exodus of emigrants to overseas countries, especially in the wake of the 1989 [[Tiananmen Square crackdown]], which more than a million Hongkongers showed up on the streets to support to student protesters in Beijing. The Tiananmen massacre of 1989 strengthened anti-Beijing sentiments and also led to the emergence of the local democracy movement, which demanded a faster pace of [[democratisation]] before and after 1997.\n\n===Early SAR era===\n{{see also|Democratic development in Hong Kong|Localism in Hong Kong}}\nSince 1997, the implementation of the [[Hong Kong Basic Law Article 45]] and Article 68, which states that the [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Chief Executive]] (CE) and the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]] (LegCo) should be chosen by [[universal suffrage]], has dominated the political agenda in Hong Kong. The [[pro-democracy camp]], one of the two largest political alignments in the territory, has called for the early implementation of the universal suffrage since the 1980s. After [[Hong Kong 1 July marches#2003|more than 500,000 people protested]] against the legislation of national security law as stipulated in the [[Hong Kong Basic Law Article 23|Basic Law Article 23]] on 1 July 2003, the [[Standing Committee of the National People's Congress]] (NPCSC) in April 2004 ruled out universal suffrage before 2012.<ref name=yeung2008>{{cite book |isbn=978-9622098824 |last=Yeung |first=Rikkie |title=Moving Millions: The Commercial Success and Political Controversies of Hong Kong |publisher=University of Hong kong Press |year=2008 }}</ref>\n\nSince 2003, Beijing's growing encroachment has led Hong Kong to become increasingly integrated as part of China.

Any advocacy for Hong Kong separating from China has no legal basis.<ref name=\"geographic\"/>\n\n* Same cultural origin and close connection: Hong Kong has been part of China for most of its history. The majority of the people in Hong Kong are of Chinese origin which their parents or themselves migrated from the Mainland; even some of the pro-independence activists such as [[Edward Leung]] were born in mainland China. Most of Hong Kong culture originates from Mainland China and is closely connected with Chinese history and culture.<ref name=\"geographic\"/>\n\n* Benefits from China's growth: The economic growth and integration of Hong Kong and China have largely been mutually beneficial. China has become the crucial factor of Hong Kong's continuing economic growth and also the largest trading partner of Hong Kong. As the center of [[Renminbi]] overseas market, Hong Kong can continue to benefit from the growth of China and its [[potential superpower]] status.\n\n* \"One Country, Two Systems\": Hong Kong, along with Macau,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://bo.io.gov.mo/bo/i/88/23/dc/en/|title=Joint declaration of the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Government of the Republic of Portugal on the question of Macao|last=FNunes|website=bo.io.gov.mo|access-date=2016-12-23}}</ref> are the only territories in the People's Republic of China to supposedly enjoy a \"high degree of autonomy\" and freedom under the \"[[One Country, Two Systems]]\" principle as guaranteed by the [[Sino-British Joint Declaration]] and the Hong Kong Basic Law. It is the system that can serve the best interest of Hong Kong people and safeguard Hong Kong's prosperity and stability, as well as individual liberties and the territory's autonomy in the long term if it is implemented properly.\n\n* Practicality: Hong Kong is surrounded by Chinese territories (both land and maritime) and lacks natural resources.  It currently relies on China in terms of food (>90% imported, including nearly all meat, vegetable and rice<ref>{{cite web|url=https://modernfarmer.com/2013/08/hong-kong-imports-over-90-of-its-food-can-it-learn-to-grow/|title=Hong Kong Imports Over 90% of Its Food.

The Beijing government's [[Anti-Secession Law|zero tolerance on any secessionist movement]] also means that any move toward independence could mean war and bloodshed.  The social stability and economic prosperity Hong Kong people have enjoyed for many years will have to be sacrificed.  The probability of Hong Kong people achieving independence via violent means is very low, as Hong Kong separatists \u2014 while capable of organizing street violence \u2014 have no combat-capable armed forces.  In contrast, China commands the [[People's Liberation Army|largest standing army in the world]] and the 10,000-strong [[People's Liberation Army Hong Kong Garrison]] is based directly in Hong Kong across numerous barracks.\n\n* Counterproductive to the democratic cause: The call for independence would \"dilute support\" for democracy as the issue of independence would mix up with and draw attention from the case for democracy.  Any attempt to reject Article 1 of the [[Hong Kong Basic Law]] will mean nullify any previous promise from Beijing to maintain Hong Kong's autonomy and would lead to direct retaliation and possible territorial annexation by the Chinese government.  Turning activism for democracy into a [[secessionist]] challenge to Chinese sovereignty would certainly be at the expenses of the long-term autonomy and civil liberties of the Hong Kong people.<ref name=\"Patten\"/>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Localism in Hong Kong]]\n* [[Hong Kong\u2013Mainland China conflict]]\n* [[Macau independence]]\n* [[Taiwan independence movement]]\n* [[Tibetan independence movement]]\n* [[East Turkestan independence movement]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Hong Kong topics}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hong Kong Independence Movement}}\n[[Category:Hong Kong independence movement| ]]\n[[Category:Politics of Hong Kong]]\n[[Category:Localism in Hong Kong]]\n[[Category:Separatism in China]]\n[[Category:Independence movements]]\n", "text_old": "{{pp-pc1}}\n{{short description|Political Movement for Hong Kong's Independence from China}}\n{{Distinguish|Hong Kong Autonomy Movement}}\n{{Update|date=January 2020}}\n{{EngvarB|date=November 2016}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2019}}\n{{Politics of Hong Kong}}\n{{Infobox Chinese\n|order=\n|showflag=\n|t=\u9999\u6e2f\u7368\u7acb\n|j=Hoeng<sup>1</sup> gong<sup>2</sup> duk<sup>6</sup> laap<sup>6</sup> \n|y=H\u0113ungg\u00f3ng duhklahp\n}}\n\n'''Hong Kong independence''' ({{zh-t|\u9999\u6e2f\u7368\u7acb}}) is a [[political movement]] that advocates for the sovereignty of [[Hong Kong]].

There were few advocates for decolonisation of Hong Kong from the British rule during the post-war period, notably [[Ma Man-fai]] and the [[Democratic Self-Government Party of Hong Kong]] in the 1960s but the fruitless movement ceased to exist without substantial support.\n\nIn the last years of the 1970s into the early 1980s, the question of Hong Kong sovereignty emerged on Hong Kong's political scene as the end of the New Territories lease was approaching. Hong Kong and [[Macau]] were both removed from the [[United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories]], in which territories on the list would have the right to be independent, on 2 November 1972 by request of the People's Republic of China (PRC). Although there were advocates for Hong Kong independence, the majority of the Hong Kong population, many of whom were political, economic or war refugees from the [[Chinese Civil War]] and the Communist regime on the mainland China, wished to maintain the status quo. The request for a Hong Kong representative in the Sino-British negotiation was rejected by Beijing. In 1984, the British and Chinese governments signed the [[Sino-British Joint Declaration]] which stated that the sovereignty of Hong Kong should be transferred to the PRC on 1 July 1997, and Hong Kong should enjoy a \"high degree of autonomy\" under the \"[[One Country, Two Systems]]\" principle.\n\nFrom 1983 to 1997, Hong Kong saw an exodus of emigrants to overseas countries, especially in the wake of the 1989 [[Tiananmen Square crackdown]], which more than a million Hongkongers showed up on the streets to support to student protesters in Beijing. The Tiananmen massacre of 1989 strengthened anti-Beijing sentiments and also led to the emergence of the local democracy movement, which demanded a faster pace of [[democratisation]] before and after 1997.\n\n===Early SAR era===\n{{see also|Democratic development in Hong Kong|Localism in Hong Kong}}\nSince 1997, the implementation of the [[Hong Kong Basic Law Article 45]] and Article 68, which states that the [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Chief Executive]] (CE) and the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]] (LegCo) should be chosen by [[universal suffrage]], has dominated the political agenda in Hong Kong. The [[pro-democracy camp]], one of the two largest political alignments in the territory, has called for the early implementation of the universal suffrage since the 1980s.

It is also a serious violation of the country's constitution, Hong Kong's Basic Law and the relevant existing laws.\"<ref name=\"slam\"/> The spokesman of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office stated that \"[Beijing] will absolutely neither permit anyone advocating secession in Hong Kong nor allow any pro-independence activists to enter a government institution,\" after the [[National People's Congress Standing Committee]] (NPCSC) interpret the Article 104 of the [[Basic Law of Hong Kong]] which aimed to disqualify the two [[Youngspiration]] legislators [[Baggio Leung]] and [[Yau Wai-ching]].<ref name=\"bar\"/> On the universities' independence banner row, a commentary titled \"A rule must be set to make Hong Kong independence criminal\" published on the state-owned ''[[People's Daily]]'' overseas edition website said the discussion on Hong Kong independence should be made illegal, just like it is illegal to promote Nazism in Germany.<ref name=\"nazi\"/>\n\nThe Hong Kong government issued a statement after the formation of the Hong Kong National Party, stating that \"any suggestion that Hong Kong should be independent or any movement to advocate such 'independence' is against the Basic Law, and will undermine the stability and prosperity of Hong Kong and impair the interest of the general public\u2026 The SAR Government will take action according to the law.\"<ref name=\"slam\"/>\n\n===Political parties===\nThe [[pro-Beijing camp]] holds the same stance with the Beijing and SAR government and strongly opposes Hong Kong independence. The mainstream [[pan-democracy camp]] sympathised with the pro-independence cause but generally opposes Hong Kong independence as they do not think it would be beneficial to Hong Kong, nor practical or achievable.<ref name=\"geographic\"/> They believe that to fight for genuine democracy and safeguard the high degree of autonomy under the \"[[One Country, Two Systems]]\" principle is the most foreseeable solution.\n\nAlthough politicians and scholars like [[Chin Wan]], [[Wong Yuk-man]] and [[Civic Passion]]'s [[Wong Yeung-tat]] are seen as leading [[localism in Hong Kong|localist]] figures and have been close to the Hong Kong independence movement and even had advocated \"nation building\", they have also cut clear that they do not support Hong Kong independence during the midst of the [[Hong Kong LegCo candidates' disqualification controversy]]. They claim they fight for an amendment of the Basic Law through civil referendum to maintain Hong Kong's autonomy similar to that of [[Greenland]]'s.<ref name=\"CPPPIHKRO\"/>\n\n===Others===\nThe last [[Governor of Hong Kong|British colonial governor]] [[Chris Patten]] opposes Hong Kong independence, worrying such activists would \"dilute support\" for democracy in Hong Kong: \"[i]t would be dishonest, dishonourable and reckless of somebody like me, to pretend that the case for democracy should be mixed up with an argument about the independence of Hong Kong \u2013 something which is not going to happen, something which dilutes support for democracy, and something which has led to all sorts of antics which should not take place in a mature society aiming to be a full democracy.\"<ref name=\"Patten\">{{cite news|title=Chris Patten warns Hong Kong pro-independence antics 'dilute support' for democracy |first=Tony |last=Cheung |url=https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/2049247/chris-patten-slams-disqualified-localist-duo-saying-hong |date=25 November 2016|newspaper=South China Morning Post}}</ref>\n\nIn September 2017, ten university heads in Hong Kong, [[City University of Hong Kong]], [[Hong Kong Baptist University]], [[Hong Kong Shue Yan University]], [[Lingnan University (Hong Kong)|Lingnan University]], the Chinese University of Hong Kong, the [[Education University of Hong Kong]], the [[Hong Kong Polytechnic University]], the [[Hong Kong University of Science and Technology]], the [[Open University of Hong Kong]] and the [[University of Hong Kong]] stated that all the universities do not support Hong Kong independence as it contravenes the Basic Law.<ref name=\"uniheads\"/>\n\n===Reasons===\nReasons cited in favor of maintaining Hong Kong as part of China include:\n* Legality: Article 1 of the [[Hong Kong Basic Law]] states that Hong Kong is an inalienable part of the People's Republic of China.  Any advocacy for Hong Kong separating from China has no legal basis.<ref name=\"geographic\"/>\n\n* Same cultural origin and close connection: Hong Kong has been part of China for most of its history. The majority of the people in Hong Kong are of Chinese origin which their parents or themselves migrated from the Mainland; even some of the pro-independence activists such as [[Edward Leung]] were born in mainland China. Most of Hong Kong culture originates from Mainland China and is closely connected with Chinese history and culture.<ref name=\"geographic\"/>\n\n* Benefits from China's growth: The economic growth and integration of Hong Kong and China have largely been mutually beneficial. China has become the crucial factor of Hong Kong's continuing economic growth and also the largest trading partner of Hong Kong. As the center of [[Renminbi]] overseas market, Hong Kong can continue to benefit from the growth of China and its [[potential superpower]] status.\n\n* \"One Country, Two Systems\": Hong Kong, along with Macau,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://bo.io.gov.mo/bo/i/88/23/dc/en/|title=Joint declaration of the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Government of the Republic of Portugal on the question of Macao|last=FNunes|website=bo.io.gov.mo|access-date=2016-12-23}}</ref> are the only territories in the People's Republic of China to supposedly enjoy a \"high degree of autonomy\" and freedom under the \"[[One Country, Two Systems]]\" principle as guaranteed by the [[Sino-British Joint Declaration]] and the Hong Kong Basic Law. It is the system that can serve the best interest of Hong Kong people and safeguard Hong Kong's prosperity and stability, as well as individual liberties and the territory's autonomy in the long term if it is implemented properly.\n\n* Practicality: Hong Kong is surrounded by Chinese territories (both land and maritime) and lacks natural resources.  It currently relies on China in terms of food (>90% imported, including nearly all meat, vegetable and rice<ref>{{cite web|url=https://modernfarmer.com/2013/08/hong-kong-imports-over-90-of-its-food-can-it-learn-to-grow/|title=Hong Kong Imports Over 90% of Its Food. Can It Learn to Grow?|author=Daniel Kong|publisher=Modern Farmer|date=2013-08-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://qz.com/827508/hong-kong-now-imports-nearly-every-single-thing-it-eats/|title=Hong Kong now imports nearly every single thing it eats|author= Echo Huang|publisher=Quartz|date=2016-11-16}}</ref>), [[water supply and sanitation in Hong Kong|fresh water]], [[electricity sector in Hong Kong|electricity]] and [[energy in Hong Kong|fuel]] supplies, and it is claimed that Hong Kong will not be self-sufficient without [[mainland China]].  The Beijing government's [[Anti-Secession Law|zero tolerance on any secessionist movement]] also means that any move toward independence could mean war and bloodshed.  The social stability and economic prosperity Hong Kong people have enjoyed for many years will have to be sacrificed.  The probability of Hong Kong people achieving independence via violent means is very low, as Hong Kong separatists \u2014 while capable of organizing street violence \u2014 have no combat-capable armed forces.  In contrast, China commands the [[People's Liberation Army|largest standing army in the world]] and the 10,000-strong [[People's Liberation Army Hong Kong Garrison]] is based directly in Hong Kong across numerous barracks.\n\n* Counterproductive to the democratic cause: The call for independence would \"dilute support\" for democracy as the issue of independence would mix up with and draw attention from the case for democracy.  Any attempt to reject Article 1 of the [[Hong Kong Basic Law]] will mean nullify any previous promise from Beijing to maintain Hong Kong's autonomy and would lead to direct retaliation and possible territorial annexation by the Chinese government.  Turning activism for democracy into a [[secessionist]] challenge to Chinese sovereignty would certainly be at the expenses of the long-term autonomy and civil liberties of the Hong Kong people.<ref name=\"Patten\"/>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Localism in Hong Kong]]\n* [[Hong Kong\u2013Mainland China conflict]]\n* [[Macau independence]]\n* [[Taiwan independence movement]]\n* [[Tibetan independence movement]]\n* [[East Turkestan independence movement]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Hong Kong topics}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hong Kong Independence Movement}}\n[[Category:Hong Kong independence movement| ]]\n[[Category:Politics of Hong Kong]]\n[[Category:Localism in Hong Kong]]\n[[Category:Separatism in China]]\n[[Category:Independence movements]]\n", "name_user": "Elim2009r", "label": "safe", "comment": "I added disneyland.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_independence"}
