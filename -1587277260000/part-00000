In its first official match they lost 0\u20131 to the Czech Republic on 7 October 1995.

The Czech Republic qualified for the play-offs.\n\nIn the [[1999 FIFA Women's World Cup qualification (UEFA)|1999 World Cup qualifying]] Belarus was ranked in Class B, with no qualifying options, together with Poland, [[Republic of Ireland women's national football team|Ireland]] and [[Wales women's national football team|Wales]].

They lost 0\u20135 and 3\u20130 to Norway, and 0\u20134 to the Netherlands. Belarus was 3rd, their best result in a top-flier qualifying stage yet.\n\nIn the [[UEFA Women's Euro 2013 qualifying|2013 European Championship qualifying]] Belarus was grouped with [[Finland women's national football team|Finland]], [[Ukraine women's national football team|Ukraine]], Slovakia and Estonia.

The team is governed by the [[Football Federation of Belarus]] (''\u0411\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0440\u0443\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0444\u044d\u0434\u044d\u0440\u0430\u0446\u044b\u044f \u043f\u0430 \u0444\u0443\u0442\u0431\u043e\u043b\u0443'').\n\n==History==\nBelarus first appeared in a [[FIFA]]/[[UEFA]] qualification stage in the [[UEFA Women's Euro 1997 qualification|1997 European Championship]], where it was paired with the [[Czech Republic women's national football team|Czech Republic]], [[Poland women's national football team|Poland]] and [[Estonia women's national football team|Estonia]]. In its first official match they lost 0\u20131 to the Czech Republic on 7 October 1995. In May 1996 they attained their first official win by beating 3\u20130 Poland, which had defeated them 2\u20130 in the first match. They subsequently beat Estonia 0\u20134 and 4\u20130 to end 3rd, tied at 9 points with Poland. The Czech Republic qualified for the play-offs.\n\nIn the [[1999 FIFA Women's World Cup qualification (UEFA)|1999 World Cup qualifying]] Belarus was ranked in Class B, with no qualifying options, together with Poland, [[Republic of Ireland women's national football team|Ireland]] and [[Wales women's national football team|Wales]]. Belarus beat Wales 4\u20131 and tied in Wales (3\u20133) and Ireland (0\u20130), losing all other three matches: 0\u20131 and 3\u20131 to Poland, 0\u20131 to Ireland. Belarus ranked 3rd with 5 points, and Poland qualified for the promotion play-offs.\n\nIn the [[UEFA Women's Euro 2001 qualification|2001 European Championship qualifying]], again in Class B, Belarus beat Estonia 4\u20131 and 0\u20137, [[Israel women's national football team|Israel]] 0\u20135 and 1\u20130 and Slovakia 1\u20130, and tied 1\u20131 in Romania, but the Romanians earned the spot in the promotion play-offs after beating Belarus 0\u20131. With this settled Belarus lost 6\u20131 to Slovakia in the last match.\n\nIn the [[2003 FIFA Women's World Cup qualification|2003 World Cup qualifying]], Class B, Belarus beat [[Bosnia and Herzegovina women's national football team|Bosnia]] 5\u20132 and 2\u20137, Turkey 4\u20130 and 1\u20135, Slovakia 3\u20132. They lost the remaining three games: 3\u20131 in Slovakia, and 2\u20130 and 2\u20134 against [[Hungary women's national football team|Hungary]]. Belarus was 3rd, tied at 15 points with Slovakia.\n\nIn the [[UEFA Women's Euro 2005 qualification|2005 European Championship qualification]], Class B, Belarus beat Estonia 5\u20130 and 1\u20133, [[Kazakhstan women's national football team|Kazakhstan]] 0\u20132 and 8\u20131, and Israel 0\u20132. They just conceded two points, from a home 1\u20131 tie against Israel. Belarus topped the group for the first time, but there were no promotion play-offs as the qualifying system was unified for 2009.\n\nIn the [[2007 FIFA Women's World Cup qualification]] Belarus was promoted for the First Category, and grouped with [[Sweden women's national football team|Sweden]], [[Iceland women's national football team|Iceland]], the Czech Republic and [[Portugal women's national football team|Portugal]]. Belarus won 0\u20131 and 3\u20132 to Portugal, and tied 1\u20131 with the Czech Republic. They lost the remaining five matches: 3\u20130 and 1\u20132 to Iceland, 6\u20130 and 0\u20136 to Sweden and 3\u20130 to the Czech Republic, ending second to last with 7 points.\n\nIn the [[UEFA Women's Euro 2009 qualifying|2009 European Championship qualifying]] Belarus was grouped with [[England women's national football team|England]], [[Spain women's national football team|Spain]], the Czech Republic and [[Northern Ireland women's national football team|Northern Ireland]]. Belarus beat Northern Ireland 5\u20130, and tied 1\u20131 with the same opponent. They lost the six remaining matches: 0\u20133 and 1\u20136 to Spain, 1\u20134 and 1\u20133 to the Czechs and 4\u20130 and 1\u20136 to England, again ending second to last.\n\nIn the [[2011 FIFA Women's World Cup qualification (UEFA)|2011 World Cup qualifying]] Belarus was grouped with [[Norway women's national football team|Norway]], the [[Netherlands women's national football team|Netherlands]], Slovakia and [[Macedonia women's national football team|Macedonia]]. They beat Slovakia 0\u20132 and 2\u20130, and Macedonia 1\u20136 and 6\u20130. They also attained a surprise 1\u20131 tie in the Netherlands. They lost 0\u20135 and 3\u20130 to Norway, and 0\u20134 to the Netherlands. Belarus was 3rd, their best result in a top-flier qualifying stage yet.\n\nIn the [[UEFA Women's Euro 2013 qualifying|2013 European Championship qualifying]] Belarus was grouped with [[Finland women's national football team|Finland]], [[Ukraine women's national football team|Ukraine]], Slovakia and Estonia. In their first four matches they have beaten Estonia 2\u20131 and [[Ukraine women's national football team|Ukraine]] 0\u20131, tied 2\u20132 with Finland and lost 3\u20130 to Slovakia.\n\n==Coaching

The regiment is subordinate to [[39 Canadian Brigade Group]], [[3rd Canadian Division]]. Based at the [[Seaforth Armoury]] on [[Burrard Street]] in Vancouver, the regiment serves in both times of war and civil emergency, such as [[disaster relief]] after earthquakes or floods. It also contributes individual volunteers or \"augmentees\" to Canadian Forces operations around the world.\n\nThe regiment was formed in 1910 and served overseas in both [[World War I]] and [[World War II]].

The question was first put to the Gaelic societies and the idea was received favourably. A meeting was held on 11 May 1909, in the St. Andrews and Caledonian Societies rooms to discuss the issue.\n\nThe topic continued to be discussed in the Scottish circles of the city. The delegates met again on 17 January 1910, and it was reported that an application had been sent to the Minister of Militia to raise a highland regiment in Vancouver. It had been decided to apply for the number 72, that of the Seaforth Highlanders in Scotland, and that number being vacant on the Canadian Militia List.\n\nOn 24 November 1910, authorization was received from the Militia Department for the formation of a new regiment in Vancouver bearing the number 72, and wearing the same uniform and tartan as the Seaforth Highlanders of the Imperial service. In a letter dated April 11, 1911, consent to use the name Seaforth Highlanders of Canada was received from the 1st and 2nd Battalions of the Imperial [[Seaforth Highlanders]].\n\nOn 22 June 1911, the years of hard work culminated in the first parade of the regiment on the parade ground in downtown Vancouver, at [[Larwill Park]], later the bus depot of [[Pacific Coast Stage Lines]] and now a parking lot, between the [[Queen Elizabeth Theatre]] and the [[Beatty Street Drill Hall]].\n\nThe Seaforths first saw active service the next year in the summer of 1912 when rallies by striking coal miners in the area around [[Nanaimo]] led to rioting. The miners were striking because of workplace safety concerns, such as lethal gas explosions that had already killed hundreds.<ref>[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/vancouver-island-coal-strike/ \"Vancouver Island Coal Strike\"]. ''The Canadian Encyclopedia'',  Lynne Bowen, 02/07/2006</ref> A company from the Seaforths was sent to garrison the area and maintain the peace. Though not a shot was ever fired, peace was restored and maintained until the unit was called back to mobilize for war in August 1914.\n\n===The Great War===\n[[File:72nd Bn CEF.jpg|left|thumb|200px|The distinguishing patch of the 72nd Battalion (Seaforth Highlanders of Canada), CEF.]][[File:James C Richardson.jpg|thumb|right|James C. Richardson of The Seaforth Highlanders of Canada Cadets. He would go on to win a Victoria Cross with the 16th Battalion (Canadian Scottish), CEF.]] \nUpon hearing of the proclamation of war with Germany on 4 August 1914 Lieutenant Colonel Edwards-Leckie, commanding officer of the Seaforth Highlanders, immediately offered the regiment for overseas service. His request was denied, and instead the regiment provided 25 officers and 514 men for the [[16th Canadian Battalion (The Canadian Scottish), CEF|16th Battalion Canadian Expeditionary Force]], forming almost half the battalion. While awaiting permission for the Seaforths to go overseas the regiment recruited and deployed an additional 41 officers and 1,637 men to numerous battalions.\n\nFinally on 18 July Major [[John Arthur Clark|J.A. Clark]] was appointed as the commander of the [[72nd Battalion (Seaforth Highlanders of Canada), CEF]] and ordered to begin training for overseas service. The regiment travelled east through Ottawa to the United Kingdom and on 18 August 1916, the Seaforths were in France. Receiving the number 72nd Battalion made the Seaforths the only Canadian regiment in World War I to deploy with its traditional regimental number as its CEF battalion number.\n\nThe Seaforths were involved in some of the bloodiest battles of the war including Ypres, the Somme, and [[Vimy Ridge]]. In the final battle for Vimy Ridge, Lieutenant D.O. Vicars and Private McWhinney (later Lieutenant McWhinney, DCM) with Corporal \"Hat\" Matthews took, unaided, 400 yards of the German Support Line, nearly the entire battalion front. Later in the battle, the commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel [[John Arthur Clark|J.A. Clark]], DSO, with one junior officer, two runners and a [[Lewis gun]] crew, pushed up a mile in advance of the battalion where they met Brigadier McBrien and two senior officers armed only with revolvers, and promptly attacked a party of 50 enemy soldiers, driving them off. During the attack on Elev Spur, the retreating enemy were in such disarray the Sergeant W. Brown, MM, stepped into a poker game, which he broke up with his rifle. It is a special tribute that the German communiqu\u00e9 referred to the Seaforths as \"specially picked assault troops.\"\n\nOne of the most notable actions in the history of the Seaforths was the capture of Crest Farm during the Battle of Passchendaele on 30 October 1917. A dispatch from the Commander-in-Chief, after the battle, stated in part that \"the unit which took Crest Farm had by this action accomplished a feat of arms which would go down in the annals of British history as one of the greatest achievements of a single unit.\"\n\nAt 10:25&nbsp;a.m. on 11 November 1918, the Seaforths received the following message while resting in Valenciennes.\n\"Canadian Corps 06.45... Hostilities will cease at 11:00 hours on November 11th... Troops will stand fast on the line reached at that time which will be reported to Corps Headquarters... Strictest precautions will be maintained... There will be no intercourse of any description with the enemy... Further instructions follow... [[Fourth Canadian Division]].\" The Great War was over.\n\nThe Seaforths would not leave France for home until May 1919 for there was still much work to be done. While they waited it was decided that the regiment should be presented with its new [[Colours, standards and guidons|colours]]. The presentation was done on April 1, 1919, by Lieutenant General [[Arthur Currie]], commander of the [[Canadian Corps]]. As the regiment marched off with their new colours flying in a stiff breeze \"there was not a man present who did not feel that they focused the romance of the Battalion's history and the memories of the Battalion's dead.\"<ref>McEvoy, B (1920). History of the 72nd Canadian Infantry Battalion Seaforth Highlanders of Canada. Vancouver [BC] : Cowan</ref>\n\n===World War II===\nIn the spring of 1939 it looked as if Canada would soon be at war again. Unlike the First World War this time The Seaforth Highlanders of Canada were among the first to deploy. On September 1, 1939, nine days before the Canadian declaration of war, the Seaforths were ordered to mobilize. In just one week the regiment recruited up to its full war-time strength and filled its first line of reinforcements. By Christmas 1939 they were aboard the UK troopship {{RMS|Andes|1939|6}} crossing the Atlantic to Scotland.\n\nAfter the withdrawal from Dunkirk the Seaforths were one of the few fully equipped regiments in England. During the [[Battle of Britain]] they filled a variety of roles including manning anti-air batteries, providing anti-parachute defence and frontline coastal defence. In August 1942 Canada's 2nd Division invaded Dieppe. It was for his actions during this raid that former Seaforth officer Lieutenant Colonel [[Charles Merritt]] was awarded his [[Victoria Cross]] while commanding [[The South Saskatchewan Regiment]]. He was presumed dead but it was discovered later that he was in fact taken prisoner.\n\nThe Seaforths however as part of the [[1st Canadian Infantry Division]] would not see combat until July 1943 in [[Operation Husky]], the invasion of Sicily. The beach landing was relatively uneventful but the Seaforths would soon see hard battles as they fought veteran German units for hilltop town after hilltop town through [[Valguarnera Caropepe|Valguarnera]], [[Leonforte]], [[Nissoria]], [[Agira]] and [[Regalbuto]], to [[Adrano]].\n\nWhen the Seaforths crossed into Italy on 4 September 1943 they found themselves and the rest of 1st Division pursuing the Germans north. The Germans had decided not to defend the south of Italy but to fight only occasionally, buying time for them to build up their defences further north. By 25 October the Seaforths had fought their way over 300 miles from the landings in [[Reggio Calabria]] to the town of [[Baranello]].\n\nAfter a rest in Baranello the Seaforths were back into action. They had reached the [[Gustav Line]], where the Germans planned to make their first stand. From December 6 to 22 the 1st Division advanced only three miles from the [[Moro (Italian river)|Moro River]] to the edge of a small town named [[Ortona]]. The town was located on the eastern end of the Gustav Line on the [[Adriatic Sea]]. The narrow streets and dense buildings lead to intense street to street fighting. The battle was so intense that it was nicknamed \"little [[Battle of Stalingrad|Stalingrad]]\".\n\nAmidst the fighting on the night of 25 December the Seaforth's quartermaster arranged a Christmas dinner for the soldiers at the front. One at a time the four companies of the regiment were rotated off the line to the Church of Santa Maria di Constantinopoli. As they sat down to a fresh meal of roast pork and mashed potatoes one soldier, a corporal, played the church's organ over the roar of the battle just a few hundred yards to the north. A few days later on 28 December the Germans pulled out of Ortona during the night, leaving the town to the Allies. Every year the Seaforth Highlanders of Canada commemorate this battle with the Ortona Dinner. This commemorative dinner takes the place of the regiment's annual Christmas dinner. Veterans from the battle along with the unit\u2019s serving and former members sit down to a Christmas dinner with the same menu served in the church in 1943.\n\nFrom Ortona the Seaforths continued to move north fighting through the Liri Valley and breaking through the [[Hitler Line]], the Germans' second defensive line. This was the hardest fought battle for the Seaforths of the entire Italian campaign. At one point on the afternoon of 23 May 1944, the Seaforths, having taken the line, repelled a German counterattack, and when the Germans pulled off only eight soldiers remained, commanded by C Company Sergeant Major J.M. Duddle, who was the senior man left on the line. By the end of the day the Seaforths had taken 210 casualties including 52 killed.\n\nThe regiment continued fighting in Italy through [[Gothic Line]], across the [[Savio River]], where Private [[E.A. \"Smokey\" Smith]]'s actions earned him a Victoria Cross and through the [[Po Valley]]. On 13 March 1945 the Seaforths boarded ships to begin the trip to Northwest Europe where they were to be used in the liberation of The Netherlands.\n\nThe Seaforths travelled through Germany and entered The Netherlands on April 7 through the town of [['s-Heerenberg]]. Their first action was the crossing of the [[IJssel River]] on 11 April. They then chased the Germans west across the fields south of [[Apeldoorn]] until the surrender of the Germans on 8 May 1945. On the 8th the Seaforths were ordered to [[Amsterdam]] to take possession from the German occupiers and make arrangements for the Germans to march home. The Seaforths were the first allied regiment to enter the city and the city lined the streets to welcome their liberators. The war was over. On 7 October 1945 the Seaforth Highlanders arrived home in Vancouver. An estimated 100,000 people lined the street from the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] station to the Seaforth Armoury where the overseas battalion was dismissed for the last time.<ref name=\"RH Roy\">Roy, RH (1969).

Between 1950 and 1953 many Seaforths volunteered to join the regular force in order to serve in the [[Korean War]]. Between 1951 and 1953 Seaforths could join the full-time army as members of the [[27th Canadian Infantry Brigade]]'s, 1st Canadian Highland Battalion, E Company (Seaforth Highlanders), which served in Germany until becoming part of [[The Black Watch (Royal Highland Regiment) of Canada]] in 1953.<ref name=\"RH Roy\"/>\nMembers of the Seaforth Highlanders of Canada since 1953 have been able to volunteer for overseas and domestic operations as individual augmentees. These augmentees fill vacant positions in regular force units while the unit is deployed overseas and then return to their reserve regiments upon the end of the deployment. Seaforths have volunteered for operations in [[Egypt]], [[Cyprus]], [[Croatia]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Kuwait]], and [[Afghanistan]].\n\nIn September 1993, members of the regiment augmenting 2nd Battalion [[Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry]] were involved in the fighting in the [[Medak Pocket]]. This operation involved fire fights between Croatian forces and the Canadians, who were there as part of the [[United Nations peacekeeping]] force.<ref>http://www.army.dnd.ca/2PPCLI/RH-United_Nations.asp</ref> This was the first full combat action of Canadian troops since the Korean War and the Canadian Government keep it secret from the Canadian public for some time, much to the dismay of the returning veterans.\n\nSince January 2006, members of the Seaforth Highlanders of Canada have deployed to Afghanistan in roles varying from training the [[Afghan National Army]] to conducting combat operations.\n\n===Modern day===\nAs a Primary Reserve unit most members of The Seaforth Highlanders are part-time soldiers. They train one night a week (currently Wednesdays) and one weekend per month. The rest of the time they work in civilian jobs or attend school. Often members will volunteer for full-time training or deployment opportunities. Their weekly training nights involve going to the Seaforth Armoury and training for three hours in the various skills required to be an infantry soldier.\n\nThe monthly weekend training exercise involves members reporting to the armoury on Friday night and going to one of the training areas in British Columbia or [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington state]]. There the soldiers combine and practice the skills they have learned during the weekly training nights before returning to the armoury on Sunday afternoon for dismissal.\n\nMembers of the Seaforth Highlanders can volunteer to deploy full-time on operations around the world. In the last 15 years Seaforths have deployed on operations in Croatia, [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and Afghanistan.\n\n====Centenary====\n2010 marked the 100th anniversary of the formation of the Seaforth Highlanders of Canada. Three public events were held to commemorate the regiment's achievements.\n\nOn May 29 the Seaforths hosted a [[military tattoo]] and community [[ceilidh]] at the Seaforth Armoury. The event included a ceremony honouring 20 Seaforth soldiers returning from service in Afghanistan.\n\nOn November 27 new [[Colours, standards and guidons|regimental colours]] were presented to the regiment at the [[Doug Mitchell Thunderbird Sports Centre]] on the [[University of British Columbia]] campus. The colours were presented by the [[Lieutenant Governor of British Columbia]], [[Steven Point]]. The ceremony included performances by the Seaforth Highlanders of Canada Pipes and Drums; the band of the [[15th Field Regiment, Royal Canadian Artillery|15th Field Regiment,RCA]]; and, the Seaforth Highlanders of Holland, a Dutch pipe band formed to commemorate the Seaforth's contribution to the liberation of the Netherlands during World War II.\n\nOn April 16, 2011, the regiment held a ceremony to lay up their old colours at Vancouver's [[Christ Church Cathedral (Vancouver)|Christ Church Cathedral]]. They then exercised their [[freedom of the city]] with a parade along Burrard Street from the cathedral to the Seaforth Armoury.<ref>[http://seaforthhighlanders.ca/freedom-of-the-city-parade-and-laying-up-of-old-colours/ Freedom of the City]</ref>\n\n==Seaforth Highlanders of Canada Museum & Archives==\n{{infobox museum\n|name= Seaforth Museum\n|image= Highlander Military button.jpg\n|established= \n|location= [[Vancouver, British Columbia]]\n|latitude= \n|longitude =\n|website= {{URL|http://seaforthhighlanders.ca/visit/}}\n|logo=|map_type=|former_name=|type=}}\nThe mission of the '''Seaforth Highlanders of Canada Regimental Museum and Archives''' is to collect, preserve and share material relating to the history of the Seaforth Highlanders of Canada.  \n\nAn official Canadian Forces Museum, there are currently displays throughout the Seaforth Armoury, as well as archival storage and research spaces on the second floor.

The question was first put to the Gaelic societies and the idea was received favourably. A meeting was held on 11 May 1909, in the St. Andrews and Caledonian Societies rooms to discuss the issue.\n\nThe topic continued to be discussed in the Scottish circles of the city. The delegates met again on 17 January 1910, and it was reported that an application had been sent to the Minister of Militia to raise a highland regiment in Vancouver. It had been decided to apply for the number 72, that of the Seaforth Highlanders in Scotland, and that number being vacant on the Canadian Militia List.\n\nOn 24 November 1910, authorization was received from the Militia Department for the formation of a new regiment in Vancouver bearing the number 72, and wearing the same uniform and tartan as the Seaforth Highlanders of the Imperial service. In a letter dated April 11, 1911, consent to use the name Seaforth Highlanders of Canada was received from the 1st and 2nd Battalions of the Imperial [[Seaforth Highlanders]].\n\nOn 22 June 1911, the years of hard work culminated in the first parade of the regiment on the parade ground in downtown Vancouver, at [[Larwill Park]], later the bus depot of [[Pacific Coast Stage Lines]] and now a parking lot, between the [[Queen Elizabeth Theatre]] and the [[Beatty Street Drill Hall]].\n\nThe Seaforths first saw active service the next year in the summer of 1912 when rallies by striking coal miners in the area around [[Nanaimo]] led to rioting. The miners were striking because of workplace safety concerns, such as lethal gas explosions that had already killed hundreds.<ref>[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/vancouver-island-coal-strike/ \"Vancouver Island Coal Strike\"]. ''The Canadian Encyclopedia'',  Lynne Bowen, 02/07/2006</ref> A company from the Seaforths was sent to garrison the area and maintain the peace. Though not a shot was ever fired, peace was restored and maintained until the unit was called back to mobilize for war in August 1914.\n\n===The Great War===\n[[File:72nd Bn CEF.jpg|left|thumb|200px|The distinguishing patch of the 72nd Battalion (Seaforth Highlanders of Canada), CEF.]][[File:James C Richardson.jpg|thumb|right|James C.

He would go on to win a Victoria Cross with the 16th Battalion (Canadian Scottish), CEF.]] \nUpon hearing of the proclamation of war with Germany on 4 August 1914 Lieutenant Colonel Edwards-Leckie, commanding officer of the Seaforth Highlanders, immediately offered the regiment for overseas service. His request was denied, and instead the regiment provided 25 officers and 514 men for the [[16th Canadian Battalion (The Canadian Scottish), CEF|16th Battalion Canadian Expeditionary Force]], forming almost half the battalion. While awaiting permission for the Seaforths to go overseas the regiment recruited and deployed an additional 41 officers and 1,637 men to numerous battalions.\n\nFinally on 18 July Major [[John Arthur Clark|J.A. Clark]] was appointed as the commander of the [[72nd Battalion (Seaforth Highlanders of Canada), CEF]] and ordered to begin training for overseas service. The regiment travelled east through Ottawa to the United Kingdom and on 18 August 1916, the Seaforths were in France. Receiving the number 72nd Battalion made the Seaforths the only Canadian regiment in World War I to deploy with its traditional regimental number as its CEF battalion number.\n\nThe Seaforths were involved in some of the bloodiest battles of the war including Ypres, the Somme, and [[Vimy Ridge]]. In the final battle for Vimy Ridge, Lieutenant D.O. Vicars and Private McWhinney (later Lieutenant McWhinney, DCM) with Corporal \"Hat\" Matthews took, unaided, 400 yards of the German Support Line, nearly the entire battalion front. Later in the battle, the commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel [[John Arthur Clark|J.A. Clark]], DSO, with one junior officer, two runners and a [[Lewis gun]] crew, pushed up a mile in advance of the battalion where they met Brigadier McBrien and two senior officers armed only with revolvers, and promptly attacked a party of 50 enemy soldiers, driving them off. During the attack on Elev Spur, the retreating enemy were in such disarray the Sergeant W. Brown, MM, stepped into a poker game, which he broke up with his rifle. It is a special tribute that the German communiqu\u00e9 referred to the Seaforths as \"specially picked assault troops.\"\n\nOne of the most notable actions in the history of the Seaforths was the capture of Crest Farm during the Battle of Passchendaele on 30 October 1917. A dispatch from the Commander-in-Chief, after the battle, stated in part that \"the unit which took Crest Farm had by this action accomplished a feat of arms which would go down in the annals of British history as one of the greatest achievements of a single unit.\"\n\nAt 10:25&nbsp;a.m. on 11 November 1918, the Seaforths received the following message while resting in Valenciennes.\n\"Canadian Corps 06.45... Hostilities will cease at 11:00 hours on November 11th... Troops will stand fast on the line reached at that time which will be reported to Corps Headquarters... Strictest precautions will be maintained... There will be no intercourse of any description with the enemy... Further instructions follow... [[Fourth Canadian Division]].\" The Great War was over.\n\nThe Seaforths would not leave France for home until May 1919 for there was still much work to be done. While they waited it was decided that the regiment should be presented with its new [[Colours, standards and guidons|colours]]. The presentation was done on April 1, 1919, by Lieutenant General [[Arthur Currie]], commander of the [[Canadian Corps]]. As the regiment marched off with their new colours flying in a stiff breeze \"there was not a man present who did not feel that they focused the romance of the Battalion's history and the memories of the Battalion's dead.\"<ref>McEvoy, B (1920). History of the 72nd Canadian Infantry Battalion Seaforth Highlanders of Canada. Vancouver [BC] : Cowan</ref>\n\n===World War II===\nIn the spring of 1939 it looked as if Canada would soon be at war again. Unlike the First World War this time The Seaforth Highlanders of Canada were among the first to deploy. On September 1, 1939, nine days before the Canadian declaration of war, the Seaforths were ordered to mobilize. In just one week the regiment recruited up to its full war-time strength and filled its first line of reinforcements. By Christmas 1939 they were aboard the UK troopship {{RMS|Andes|1939|6}} crossing the Atlantic to Scotland.\n\nAfter the withdrawal from Dunkirk the Seaforths were one of the few fully equipped regiments in England. During the [[Battle of Britain]] they filled a variety of roles including manning anti-air batteries, providing anti-parachute defence and frontline coastal defence. In August 1942 Canada's 2nd Division invaded Dieppe. It was for his actions during this raid that former Seaforth officer Lieutenant Colonel [[Charles Merritt]] was awarded his [[Victoria Cross]] while commanding [[The South Saskatchewan Regiment]]. He was presumed dead but it was discovered later that he was in fact taken prisoner.\n\nThe Seaforths however as part of the [[1st Canadian Infantry Division]] would not see combat until July 1943 in [[Operation Husky]], the invasion of Sicily. The beach landing was relatively uneventful but the Seaforths would soon see hard battles as they fought veteran German units for hilltop town after hilltop town through [[Valguarnera Caropepe|Valguarnera]], [[Leonforte]], [[Nissoria]], [[Agira]] and [[Regalbuto]], to [[Adrano]].\n\nWhen the Seaforths crossed into Italy on 4 September 1943 they found themselves and the rest of 1st Division pursuing the Germans north. The Germans had decided not to defend the south of Italy but to fight only occasionally, buying time for them to build up their defences further north. By 25 October the Seaforths had fought their way over 300 miles from the landings in [[Reggio Calabria]] to the town of [[Baranello]].\n\nAfter a rest in Baranello the Seaforths were back into action. They had reached the [[Gustav Line]], where the Germans planned to make their first stand. From December 6 to 22 the 1st Division advanced only three miles from the [[Moro (Italian river)|Moro River]] to the edge of a small town named [[Ortona]]. The town was located on the eastern end of the Gustav Line on the [[Adriatic Sea]]. The narrow streets and dense buildings lead to intense street to street fighting. The battle was so intense that it was nicknamed \"little [[Battle of Stalingrad|Stalingrad]]\".\n\nAmidst the fighting on the night of 25 December the Seaforth's quartermaster arranged a Christmas dinner for the soldiers at the front. One at a time the four companies of the regiment were rotated off the line to the Church of Santa Maria di Constantinopoli. As they sat down to a fresh meal of roast pork and mashed potatoes one soldier, a corporal, played the church's organ over the roar of the battle just a few hundred yards to the north. A few days later on 28 December the Germans pulled out of Ortona during the night, leaving the town to the Allies. Every year the Seaforth Highlanders of Canada commemorate this battle with the Ortona Dinner. This commemorative dinner takes the place of the regiment's annual Christmas dinner. Veterans from the battle along with the unit\u2019s serving and former members sit down to a Christmas dinner with the same menu served in the church in 1943.\n\nFrom Ortona the Seaforths continued to move north fighting through the Liri Valley and breaking through the [[Hitler Line]], the Germans' second defensive line. This was the hardest fought battle for the Seaforths of the entire Italian campaign. At one point on the afternoon of 23 May 1944, the Seaforths, having taken the line, repelled a German counterattack, and when the Germans pulled off only eight soldiers remained, commanded by C Company Sergeant Major J.M. Duddle, who was the senior man left on the line. By the end of the day the Seaforths had taken 210 casualties including 52 killed.\n\nThe regiment continued fighting in Italy through [[Gothic Line]], across the [[Savio River]], where Private [[E.A. \"Smokey\" Smith]]'s actions earned him a Victoria Cross and through the [[Po Valley]]. On 13 March 1945 the Seaforths boarded ships to begin the trip to Northwest Europe where they were to be used in the liberation of The Netherlands.\n\nThe Seaforths travelled through Germany and entered The Netherlands on April 7 through the town of [['s-Heerenberg]]. Their first action was the crossing of the [[IJssel River]] on 11 April. They then chased the Germans west across the fields south of [[Apeldoorn]] until the surrender of the Germans on 8 May 1945. On the 8th the Seaforths were ordered to [[Amsterdam]] to take possession from the German occupiers and make arrangements for the Germans to march home. The Seaforths were the first allied regiment to enter the city and the city lined the streets to welcome their liberators. The war was over. On 7 October 1945 the Seaforth Highlanders arrived home in Vancouver. An estimated 100,000 people lined the street from the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] station to the Seaforth Armoury where the overseas battalion was dismissed for the last time.<ref name=\"RH Roy\">Roy, RH (1969). The Seaforth Highlanders of Canada, 1919\u20131965. Vancouver [BC]: Seaforth Highlanders of Canada</ref>\n\n===Post-war===\nThe Seaforth Highlanders of Canada has not served overseas as a regiment since the end of World War II but the regiment continues to contribute reserve soldiers to operations around the World. Between 1950 and 1953 many Seaforths volunteered to join the regular force in order to serve in the [[Korean War]]. Between 1951 and 1953 Seaforths could join the full-time army as members of the [[27th Canadian Infantry Brigade]]'s, 1st Canadian Highland Battalion, E Company (Seaforth Highlanders), which served in Germany until becoming part of [[The Black Watch (Royal Highland Regiment) of Canada]] in 1953.<ref name=\"RH Roy\"/>\nMembers of the Seaforth Highlanders of Canada since 1953 have been able to volunteer for overseas and domestic operations as individual augmentees. These augmentees fill vacant positions in regular force units while the unit is deployed overseas and then return to their reserve regiments upon the end of the deployment. Seaforths have volunteered for operations in [[Egypt]], [[Cyprus]], [[Croatia]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Kuwait]], and [[Afghanistan]].\n\nIn September 1993, members of the regiment augmenting 2nd Battalion [[Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry]] were involved in the fighting in the [[Medak Pocket]]. This operation involved fire fights between Croatian forces and the Canadians, who were there as part of the [[United Nations peacekeeping]] force.<ref>See: http://www.army.dnd.ca/2PPCLI/RH-United_Nations.asp\n</ref> This was the first full combat action of Canadian troops since the Korean War and the Canadian Government keep it secret from the Canadian public for some time, much to the dismay of the returning veterans.\n\nSince January 2006, members of the Seaforth Highlanders of Canada have deployed to Afghanistan in roles varying from training the [[Afghan National Army]] to conducting combat operations.\n\n===Modern day===\nAs a Primary Reserve unit most members of The Seaforth Highlanders are part-time soldiers. They train one night a week (currently Wednesdays) and one weekend per month. The rest of the time they work in civilian jobs or attend school. Often members will volunteer for full-time training or deployment opportunities. Their weekly training nights involve going to the Seaforth Armoury and training for three hours in the various skills required to be an infantry soldier.\n\nThe monthly weekend training exercise involves members reporting to the armoury on Friday night and going to one of the training areas in British Columbia or [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington state]]. There the soldiers combine and practice the skills they have learned during the weekly training nights before returning to the armoury on Sunday afternoon for dismissal.\n\nMembers of the Seaforth Highlanders can volunteer to deploy full-time on operations around the world. In the last 15 years Seaforths have deployed on operations in Croatia, [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and Afghanistan.\n\n====Centenary====\n2010 marked the 100th anniversary of the formation of the Seaforth Highlanders of Canada. Three public events were held to commemorate the regiment's achievements.\n\nOn May 29 the Seaforths hosted a [[military tattoo]] and community [[ceilidh]] at the Seaforth Armoury. The event included a ceremony honouring 20 Seaforth soldiers returning from service in Afghanistan.\n\nOn November 27 new [[Colours, standards and guidons|regimental colours]] were presented to the regiment at the [[Doug Mitchell Thunderbird Sports Centre]] on the [[University of British Columbia]] campus. The colours were presented by the [[Lieutenant Governor of British Columbia]], [[Steven Point]]. The ceremony included performances by the Seaforth Highlanders of Canada Pipes and Drums; the band of the [[15th Field Regiment, Royal Canadian Artillery|15th Field Regiment,RCA]]; and, the Seaforth Highlanders of Holland, a Dutch pipe band formed to commemorate the Seaforth's contribution to the liberation of the Netherlands during World War II.\n\nOn April 16, 2011, the regiment held a ceremony to lay up their old colours at Vancouver's [[Christ Church Cathedral (Vancouver)|Christ Church Cathedral]]. They then exercised their [[freedom of the city]] with a parade along Burrard Street from the cathedral to the Seaforth Armoury.<ref>[http://seaforthhighlanders.ca/freedom-of-the-city-parade-and-laying-up-of-old-colours/ Freedom of the City]</ref>\n\n==Seaforth Highlanders of Canada Museum & Archives==\n{{infobox museum\n|name= Seaforth Museum\n|image= Highlander Military button.jpg\n|established= \n|location= [[Vancouver, British Columbia]]\n|latitude= \n|longitude =\n|website= {{URL|http://seaforthhighlanders.ca/visit/}}\n|logo=|map_type=|former_name=|type=}}\nThe mission of the '''Seaforth Highlanders of Canada Regimental Museum and Archives''' is to collect, preserve and share material relating to the history of the Seaforth Highlanders of Canada.  \n\nAn official Canadian Forces Museum, there are currently displays throughout the Seaforth Armoury, as well as archival storage and research spaces on the second floor.
