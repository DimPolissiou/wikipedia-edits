In the winter he frequented the courses farther south in Florida playing big money games against vacationing gangsters from [[Chicago]]. After the first year, they wouldn't bet against him so he found a set of left-handed clubs and played with that handicap. The next year he played one-handed. It is also said he won a $5,000 bet by making par by hitting the ball with a Coke bottle. Through these hustles he acquired the moniker of \"The Golfing Bandit.\"<ref name=lat/>\n\nAustin also traveled across the country performing trick shots and challenging anyone to try to outdrive him. He said he could hit a variety of shots with an ordinary set of golf clubs. He told a biographer that he \"lived like a maharaja\" during that time.  When steel shafts were first introduced, Sam Snead received a set (a rather stiff set) and promptly gave them to Austin, saying, \"You're the only one who swings fast enough to hit these.\"\n\n==Moving to Hollywood==\nIn the late 1930s, Austin moved to [[Los Angeles]] to become a pro at the [[Wilshire Country Club]]. When he arrived, the job fell through so he worked at other golf courses, teaching and competing. His roommate was [[Errol Flynn]] and they frequented local nightclubs in search of women. Austin also auditioned for roles in movies and eventually appeared in a number of [[motion pictures]]. However, his golfing and acting were put on hold when he joined the service. Having never completed U.S. citizenship, he went to [[Canada]] and joined the R.A.F.\n\nAustin established a name for himself as a golf teacher and was eventually sought out by [[Howard Hughes]] for lessons. He eventually established a gym in Hollywood where he taught boxing, [[tennis]], [[baseball]] and [[golf]]. The walls of the gym were covered with mirrors which he said sped up the learning process. When he gave lectures about golf he dressed in a tight-fitting black leotard with white outlines of the skeletal structure. He wanted students to see how the bones were positioned in the correct golf swing.  Austin also appeared/acted in the Michael Douglas movie \"Star Chamber\" as Judge Lang.  Austin's wife Tanya also was in the movies.  She appeared in the movie \"The Blues Brothers.\" Austin also had a voice good enough to sing light opera.  He would occasionally break out in song at, some say, the most awkward of moments.  Austin also spoke several languages.\n\n==Setting the World Record==\nFor years Austin was well known by professional golfers for his length off the tee. But it was one drive in 1974 that secured his name in history. While playing in the U.S. National Seniors Tournament, at the Winterwood Golf Course (now the Desert Rose) Austin was put in a foursome with PGA Champion [[Chandler Harper]]. After hitting several 400-yard drives, Chandler said, \"Mike, let's see you really let one go.\" Austin drove the green on 450-yard par 4. It carried to the edge of the green, bounced over and rolled past the pin and off the back edge. In a 2003 interview, Chandler said he found a ball on the next tee box and called to Austin, \"This is impossible, but there is a ball over here.\" They identified the ball as Austin's and stepped off the distance back to the center of the green. The drive was 515 yards.  GBWW no longer recognizes the world's longest drive in their book.\n\nSeveral factors make this record feat especially amazing, although there was a tailwind estimated at 25&nbsp;mph.  The drive was done on level ground, using a persimmon wood driver with 10 degrees of loft and a 43.5\" extra-stiff steel shaft, the ball was a soft balata and Mike Austin was 64 years old.  The improved technology of today should achieve far greater distances in the same conditions.\n\n==The Mike Austin Swing==\n[[Image:Mike Austin Sequence.JPG|thumb|300px|right|The Mike Austin Swing, as shown by a sequence of high-speed photographs.]]\nAustin's golf swing, known as The '''Mike Austin Swing''', is has been practiced and taught by numerous golf professionals. It is based on the principle of \"supple quickness\", whereby speed is generated through relaxation of all active muscles.<ref name=lat/> Austin demonstrated the power of the swing by securing the world long drive title with a 515 yard shot while playing in the U.S. National Seniors Open in 1974. He was 64 years old at the time. \n\nThe Austin swing breaks from standard Professional Golf Association teaching in a number of ways:\n\n# The hips slide laterally rather than turning.\n# The clubhead is thrown from the top of the swing, not released at the last moment. \n# The golfer bends forward from the hips rather than bending with the knees.\n\nAustin designed his golf swing to use the joints of the body in the way they designed. He claimed that his swing did not cause back injuries which are so common among professional golfers. Late in his career, Austin changed his hand motion to a counter-rotation of the forearms that keeps the club facing the target throughout the swing.\n\nStudents of Austin include World Long Drive Champion Mike Dunaway and Jaacob Bowden. Speaking about Austin, Dunaway said \"He is the dean of all golf instruction from the beginning of time, as far as I'm concerned.\"<ref name=lat/>\n\n==Instructors==\nA number of golf instructors teaching Austin\u2019s swing include:\n\n*Mike Dunaway in Arkansas <ref name=\"dunaway\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.mikedunaway.org/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=April 3, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161020085409/http://www.mikedunaway.org/ |archive-date=October 20, 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n*Walter \"Smiley\" Jones in Oregon/California\n*[[Daniel Robert Shauger]] in California <ref name=\"shauger\">http://www.danshaugergolf.com</ref>\n\n*[[Jaacob Bowden]] in NY, USA <ref name=\"bowden\">http://www.swingmangolf.com/learn-the-mike-austin-golf-swing.asp</ref>\n*Betsy Cullen (former LPGA TOUR winner) currently at Pine Forest C.C. in Houston, Texas\n*Heiko Falke in Germany <ref name=\"falko\">http://www.mikeaustin.de</ref> Mike Austin Teacher since 2005, brand owner for Germany\n*John Marshall in Atlanta <ref name=\"marshall\">http://www.jmlongdrive.com</ref>\n*Steve Pratt in California <ref name=\"pratt\">http://www.hititlonger.com</ref>\n*Deb Vangellow, Sweetwater C.C.

A relative latecomer to the sport, Cowan did not play football until he was 17 and was 22 by the time he turned professional. He made his league debut for [[Doncaster Rovers F.C.|Doncaster Rovers]] in 1923, and signed for [[Football League First Division|First Division]] [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] the following season.\n\nCowan played [[defender (association football)|centre half]] for Manchester City for 11&nbsp;seasons, captaining the team in the early to mid-1930s. He is the only player to have represented Manchester City in three [[FA Cup]] finals, as a runner-up in [[1926 FA Cup Final|1926]] and [[1933 FA Cup Final|1933]], and as a winner in [[1934 FA Cup Final|1934]]. Internationally, he gained three [[England national football team|England]] [[Cap (sport)|caps]] between 1926 and 1931. In total he played 407&nbsp;times for Manchester City, putting him 12th in terms of all-time appearances. In 1935, he transferred to [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City]], and subsequently moved to [[Mossley A.F.C.|Mossley]] as [[player-manager]].\n\nIn 1938, Cowan joined [[Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton & Hove Albion]] as a coach, and set up a physiotherapy business. He returned to Manchester City as manager in 1946, winning the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] in his only season in charge. He continued to work in sports and physiotherapy until his death in 1964.\n\n==Football career==\n===Early career===\nCowan was born on 10 May 1901 in [[Chesterfield]], but moved further north in his early years and was raised in [[Adwick le Street]] near [[Doncaster]].<ref name=\"halloffame\">James, ''The Official Manchester City Hall of Fame'', p.&nbsp;152.</ref> He did not play football as a child, only gaining an interest in the sport when he took part in a game at a local park aged 17.<ref name=\"azmanc\">{{cite book |last=Brandon |first=Derek <!--Invalid ISBN |isbn=0-86148-001-7 -->|ol=13768775M | title=A\u2013Z of Manchester Football: 100 Years of Rivalry |publisher=Boondoggle |location=London |year=1978|page= 46}}</ref> He then started to play for local teams, including Adwick Juniors, [[Bullcroft Main Colliery F.C.|Bullcroft Main Colliery]] and [[Denaby United F.C.|Denaby United]] and had an unsuccessful trial at [[Huddersfield Town A.F.C.|Huddersfield Town]].<ref name=\"halloffame\"/>\n\nIn 1923, Cowan gained his first professional contract following a successful trial at his local league club, [[Doncaster Rovers F.C.|Doncaster Rovers]] of the [[Football League Third Division North|Third Division (North)]].<ref name=\"halloffame\"/> Despite playing as a defender, during his time at Doncaster he scored regularly, including a [[hat-trick]] of headed goals against [[Halifax Town A.F.C.|Halifax Town]] in March 1924.<ref name=\"Clayton\">{{cite book |first=David |last=Clayton |title=Everything Under the Blue Moon |isbn=1-84018-687-9 | publisher=Mainstream Publishing |year=2002 |page= 60}}</ref> His performances gained the attention of bigger clubs, and in December 1924 he joined [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]], who sought a successor to the likes of [[Mick Hamill]] and [[Max Woosnam]].<ref name=\"mre\">{{cite book |last=Penney |first=Ian |title=The Maine Road Encyclopedia |publisher=Mainstream Publishing |location=Edinburgh |year=1995 |isbn=1-85158-710-1 |pages= 49\u201350}}</ref>\n\n===Manchester City===\nCowan made his Manchester City debut in a 2\u20132 draw against [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] on 20 December 1924,<ref>{{cite book |last=James |first=Gary |title=Manchester City \u2013 The Complete Record |publisher=Breedon |location=Derby |year=2006 |isbn=1-85983-512-0 |page= 169}}</ref> and scored his first goal for the club two weeks later, against [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]]. He played in all but one of the remaining league matches that season, 21 in total.\n\nStarting all but four of Manchester City's matches in the [[1925-26 in English football|1925\u201326 season]], Cowan was a key part of the team which reached the [[1926 FA Cup Final]], winning several ties by wide margins en route. However, in the final City were beaten 1\u20130 by [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]]. Further disappointment followed in the [[English football league system|league]], when after a campaign characterised by erratic form, City were [[promotion and relegation|relegated]] on the final day of the season. By this time Cowan's reputation as a competent centre-back had grown, and he received an international call-up. He made his [[England national football team|England]] debut on 24 May 1926 playing an unfamiliar left-half role in a 5\u20133 win against [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]].<ref name=\"hof156\"/> By 1931, he had earned three international [[cap (sport)|caps]], the others gained in matches against [[France national football team|France]] and [[Austria national football team|Austria]].<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.englandstats.com/playerreport.php?pid=266\n|title=Sam Cowan\n|accessdate=11 May 2008\n|publisher=Englandstats.com}}</ref> He also made appearances for the [[The Football League XI|Football League team]], including a trial match against England in 1931.\n\nIn the [[1926-27 in English football|1926\u201327 season]], Cowan made 27 appearances as his club sought an immediate return to the top division. The race for promotion went to the final match, with Manchester City and [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] both in contention for the second of the two promotion places. Cowan played in a resounding City win, an 8\u20130 victory against [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City]]. The watching crowd believed the result to be sufficient for promotion, but Portsmouth's match had been delayed by 15 minutes and was still in progress. A late Portsmouth goal meant the final scoreline in their match was a 5\u20131 win, enough to give Portsmouth second place on [[goal average]] by a margin of one two-hundredth of a goal.<ref>James, ''Manchester City \u2013 The Complete Record'', p.&nbsp;116.</ref> The club won the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] championship the following season, gaining [[promotion and relegation|promotion]] to the top flight. The Second Division championship was Cowan's first honour in professional football.\n\nIn the early 1930s, Cowan became Manchester City captain, succeeding [[Jimmy McMullan]]. During his captaincy the club reached two further [[FA Cup Final]]s. The first of these was in [[1933 FA Cup Final|1933]], against [[Everton F.C.|Everton]]. During the match Cowan was up against Everton captain [[Dixie Dean]]. Both players were renowned for their heading ability. [[Matt Busby]] claimed that Cowan could \"head a ball as far as most of us could kick it\",<ref>James, ''Manchester City \u2013 The Complete Record'', p.&nbsp;170.</ref> but Dean prevailed in the aerial battle, scoring Everton's second goal with a header. The ''[[Daily Mail]]'' observed that Dean's presence gave Cowan a dilemma: \"He was torn between a determination not to leave Dean and a desire to help his forwards. He broke down between the two.\"<ref>{{cite book | first=Gary | last=James| coauthors= | title=Manchester: The Greatest City | publisher=Polar | location=Leicester | year=2002 | editor= | isbn=1-899538-22-4}} p136</ref> Everton were 3\u20130 victors, but when Cowan received his runner's up medal from the [[George VI of the United Kingdom|Duke of York]], he remarked that he would come back next year to win.<ref>Some sources mistakenly state that the remark was made to [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]], who did not attend the 1933 final.</ref> True to Cowan's word, City returned to [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]] the following year. In the [[1934 FA Cup Final]], Cowan became the first and thus far only Manchester City player to represent the club in three FA Cup finals.<ref>James, ''The Official Manchester City Hall of Fame'', p.&nbsp;153.</ref> He captained City to a 2\u20131 victory over [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]]. As team captain Cowan held primary responsibility for motivating his fellow players and match tactics.<ref name=\"Kelly\">{{cite book |last=Kelly |first=Graham |title=Terrace Heroes: The Life and Times of the 1930s Professional Footballer |publisher=Routledge |location=London |year=2004 |isbn=0-7146-5359-4 |page= 94}}</ref> This was typical for a captain of his era, as [[Coach (sport)|managers]] of the period were chiefly administrators who had little input into coaching and tactics.<ref name=\"Kelly\"/>\n\nCowan's final season at [[Maine Road]] was [[1934-35 in English football|1934\u201335]], in which he was ever-present. His final match for the club was a 5\u20130 defeat of [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] on 4 May 1935.<ref>James, ''Manchester City \u2013 The Complete Record'', p.&nbsp;348.</ref> In total he made 407 appearances for Manchester City, scoring 24 goals. As of 2008 he ranks 12th all-time for Manchester City appearances. [[Bob Donnelly]] was signed to replace him in the 1935 close season, and [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City]] signed Cowan for a fee of [[pound sterling|\u00a3]]2,000 in October 1935. At the time the transfer fee was the second highest ever paid by the club.<ref name=\"hof156\">James, ''The Official Manchester City Hall of Fame'', p.&nbsp;156.</ref>\n\n===Bradford City===\nBradford City were struggling in the [[Football League Division Two|Second Division]] at the time of Cowan's signing, having won just one of their first ten games of the [[1935-36 in English football|1935\u201336]] season. Cowan made his debut for them on 19 October 1935 in a 2\u20132 draw with [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]], but it was not until Cowan's third game that Bradford won for the second time that season. Cowan missed just three of the club's remaining fixtures that season, playing 29 times in the league and three in the FA Cup as City finished 12th.<ref>{{cite book\n|last=Frost\n|first=Terry\n|title=Bradford City A Complete Record 1903\u20131988\n|publisher=Breedon Books Sport\n|year=1988\n|pages=226\u2013227\n|isbn=0-907969-38-0}}</ref> The following season, City again struggled. Cowan missed just one of the first 23 games, but after Christmas, he was restricted to just six; and without Cowan, Bradford finished 21st and were relegated to the Third Division (North).<ref>{{cite book\n|last=Frost\n|title=Bradford City A Complete Record 1903\u20131988\n|pages=228\u2013229}}</ref>\n\n===Managerial career===\nIn 1937, Cowan was appointed player-manager at [[Mossley A.F.C.|Mossley]]. He led the club to the seventh place in the [[Cheshire County League|Cheshire League]] and to the [[Manchester Challenge Shield]] title. On the pitch, he played 39 matches and scored one goal.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.mossleyweb.com/Managers1.htm\n|title=The Mossley Managers\n|accessdate=12 May 2008\n|publisher=Mossley AFC}}</ref> At the end of the season Cowan resigned to join [[Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton & Hove Albion]] coaching staff. In October 1945, a shortage of players resulted in Cowan taking to the field in a wartime match against [[A.F.C. Bournemouth|Bournemouth]]. Aged 44 years and 156 days, he became the oldest ever Brighton player.<ref>{{cite news |title = Seagulls move for Beasant |url = http://www.theargus.co.uk/news/5117287.Seagulls_move_for_Beasant/ |publisher = The Argus |date = 30 January 2003 |accessdate = 13 December 2017\n}}</ref> While at Brighton, Cowan started a [[physiotherapy]] business based near the [[Goldstone Ground]].<ref name=\"Clayton\"/>\n\nIn November 1946, Cowan became Manchester City manager, succeeding [[Wilf Wild]], who moved to a purely administrative role.<ref name=\"mre\"/> Cowan had been known for his motivational skills as a player, and was part of a new generation of managers who took responsibility for tactics and team selection, of which Cowan's contemporary and former teammate [[Matt Busby]] became the most well-known.

A relative latecomer to the sport, Cowan did not play football until he was 17 and was 22 by the time he turned professional. He made his league debut for [[Doncaster Rovers F.C.|Doncaster Rovers]] in 1923, and signed for [[Football League First Division|First Division]] [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] the following season.\n\nCowan played [[defender (football)|centre half]] for Manchester City for 11&nbsp;seasons, captaining the team in the early to mid-1930s. He is the only player to have represented Manchester City in three [[FA Cup]] finals, as a runner-up in [[1926 FA Cup Final|1926]] and [[1933 FA Cup Final|1933]], and as a winner in [[1934 FA Cup Final|1934]]. Internationally, he gained three [[England national football team|England]] [[Cap (sport)|caps]] between 1926 and 1931. In total he played 407&nbsp;times for Manchester City, putting him 12th in terms of all-time appearances. In 1935, he transferred to [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City]], and subsequently moved to [[Mossley A.F.C.|Mossley]] as [[player-manager]].\n\nIn 1938, Cowan joined [[Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton & Hove Albion]] as a coach, and set up a physiotherapy business. He returned to Manchester City as manager in 1946, winning the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] in his only season in charge. He continued to work in sports and physiotherapy until his death in 1964.\n\n==Football career==\n===Early career===\nCowan was born on 10 May 1901 in [[Chesterfield]], but moved further north in his early years and was raised in [[Adwick le Street]] near [[Doncaster]].<ref name=\"halloffame\">James, ''The Official Manchester City Hall of Fame'', p.&nbsp;152.</ref> He did not play football as a child, only gaining an interest in the sport when he took part in a game at a local park aged 17.<ref name=\"azmanc\">{{cite book |last=Brandon |first=Derek <!--Invalid ISBN |isbn=0-86148-001-7 -->|ol=13768775M  | title=A\u2013Z of Manchester Football: 100 Years of Rivalry |publisher=Boondoggle |location=London |year=1978|page= 46}}</ref> He then started to play for local teams, including Adwick Juniors, [[Bullcroft Main Colliery F.C.|Bullcroft Main Colliery]] and [[Denaby United F.C.|Denaby United]] and had an unsuccessful trial at [[Huddersfield Town A.F.C.|Huddersfield Town]].<ref name=\"halloffame\"/>\n\nIn 1923, Cowan gained his first professional contract following a successful trial at his local league club, [[Doncaster Rovers F.C.|Doncaster Rovers]] of the [[Football League Third Division North|Third Division (North)]].<ref name=\"halloffame\"/> Despite playing as a defender, during his time at Doncaster he scored regularly, including a [[hat-trick]] of headed goals against [[Halifax Town A.F.C.|Halifax Town]] in March 1924.<ref name=\"Clayton\">{{cite book |first=David |last=Clayton |title=Everything Under the Blue Moon |isbn=1-84018-687-9 | publisher=Mainstream Publishing |year=2002 |page= 60}}</ref> His performances gained the attention of bigger clubs, and in December 1924 he joined [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]], who sought a successor to the likes of [[Mick Hamill]] and [[Max Woosnam]].<ref name=\"mre\">{{cite book |last=Penney |first=Ian |title=The Maine Road Encyclopedia |publisher=Mainstream Publishing |location=Edinburgh |year=1995 |isbn=1-85158-710-1 |pages= 49\u201350}}</ref>\n\n===Manchester City===\nCowan made his Manchester City debut in a 2\u20132 draw against [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] on 20 December 1924,<ref>{{cite book |last=James |first=Gary |title=Manchester City \u2013 The Complete Record |publisher=Breedon |location=Derby |year=2006 |isbn=1-85983-512-0 |page= 169}}</ref> and scored his first goal for the club two weeks later, against [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]]. He played in all but one of the remaining league matches that season, 21 in total.\n\nStarting all but four of Manchester City's matches in the [[1925-26 in English football|1925\u201326 season]], Cowan was a key part of the team which reached the [[1926 FA Cup Final]], winning several ties by wide margins en route. However, in the final City were beaten 1\u20130 by [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]]. Further disappointment followed in the [[English football league system|league]], when after a campaign characterised by erratic form, City were [[promotion and relegation|relegated]] on the final day of the season. By this time Cowan's reputation as a competent centre-back had grown, and he received an international call-up. He made his [[England national football team|England]] debut on 24 May 1926 playing an unfamiliar left-half role in a 5\u20133 win against [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]].<ref name=\"hof156\"/> By 1931, he had earned three international [[cap (sport)|caps]], the others gained in matches against [[France national football team|France]] and [[Austria national football team|Austria]].<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.englandstats.com/playerreport.php?pid=266\n|title=Sam Cowan\n|accessdate=11 May 2008\n|publisher=Englandstats.com}}</ref> He also made appearances for the [[The Football League XI|Football League team]], including a trial match against England in 1931.\n\nIn the [[1926-27 in English football|1926\u201327 season]], Cowan made 27 appearances as his club sought an immediate return to the top division. The race for promotion went to the final match, with Manchester City and [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] both in contention for the second of the two promotion places. Cowan played in a resounding City win, an 8\u20130 victory against [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City]]. The watching crowd believed the result to be sufficient for promotion, but Portsmouth's match had been delayed by 15 minutes and was still in progress. A late Portsmouth goal meant the final scoreline in their match was a 5\u20131 win, enough to give Portsmouth second place on [[goal average]] by a margin of one two-hundredth of a goal.<ref>James, ''Manchester City \u2013 The Complete Record'', p.&nbsp;116.</ref> The club won the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] championship the following season, gaining [[promotion and relegation|promotion]] to the top flight. The Second Division championship was Cowan's first honour in professional football.\n\nIn the early 1930s, Cowan became Manchester City captain, succeeding [[Jimmy McMullan]]. During his captaincy the club reached two further [[FA Cup Final]]s. The first of these was in [[1933 FA Cup Final|1933]], against [[Everton F.C.|Everton]]. During the match Cowan was up against Everton captain [[Dixie Dean]]. Both players were renowned for their heading ability. [[Matt Busby]] claimed that Cowan could \"head a ball as far as most of us could kick it\",<ref>James, ''Manchester City \u2013 The Complete Record'', p.&nbsp;170.</ref> but Dean prevailed in the aerial battle, scoring Everton's second goal with a header. The ''[[Daily Mail]]'' observed that Dean's presence gave Cowan a dilemma: \"He was torn between a determination not to leave Dean and a desire to help his forwards. He broke down between the two.\"<ref>{{cite book | first=Gary | last=James| coauthors= | title=Manchester: The Greatest City | publisher=Polar | location=Leicester | year=2002 | editor= | isbn=1-899538-22-4}} p136</ref> Everton were 3\u20130 victors, but when Cowan received his runner's up medal from the [[George VI of the United Kingdom|Duke of York]], he remarked that he would come back next year to win.<ref>Some sources mistakenly state that the remark was made to [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]], who did not attend the 1933 final.</ref> True to Cowan's word, City returned to [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]] the following year. In the [[1934 FA Cup Final]], Cowan became the first and thus far only Manchester City player to represent the club in three FA Cup finals.<ref>James, ''The Official Manchester City Hall of Fame'', p.&nbsp;153.</ref> He captained City to a 2\u20131 victory over [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]]. As team captain Cowan held primary responsibility for motivating his fellow players and match tactics.<ref name=\"Kelly\">{{cite book |last=Kelly |first=Graham |title=Terrace Heroes: The Life and Times of the 1930s Professional Footballer |publisher=Routledge |location=London |year=2004 |isbn=0-7146-5359-4 |page= 94}}</ref> This was typical for a captain of his era, as [[Coach (sport)|managers]] of the period were chiefly administrators who had little input into coaching and tactics.<ref name=\"Kelly\"/>\n\nCowan's final season at [[Maine Road]] was [[1934-35 in English football|1934\u201335]], in which he was ever-present. His final match for the club was a 5\u20130 defeat of [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] on 4 May 1935.<ref>James, ''Manchester City \u2013 The Complete Record'', p.&nbsp;348.</ref> In total he made 407 appearances for Manchester City, scoring 24 goals. As of 2008 he ranks 12th all-time for Manchester City appearances. [[Bob Donnelly]] was signed to replace him in the 1935 close season, and [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City]] signed Cowan for a fee of [[pound sterling|\u00a3]]2,000 in October 1935. At the time the transfer fee was the second highest ever paid by the club.<ref name=\"hof156\">James, ''The Official Manchester City Hall of Fame'', p.&nbsp;156.</ref>\n\n===Bradford City===\nBradford City were struggling in the [[Football League Division Two|Second Division]] at the time of Cowan's signing, having won just one of their first ten games of the [[1935-36 in English football|1935\u201336]] season. Cowan made his debut for them on 19 October 1935 in a 2\u20132 draw with [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]], but it was not until Cowan's third game that Bradford won for the second time that season. Cowan missed just three of the club's remaining fixtures that season, playing 29 times in the league and three in the FA Cup as City finished 12th.<ref>{{cite book\n|last=Frost\n|first=Terry\n|title=Bradford City A Complete Record 1903\u20131988\n|publisher=Breedon Books Sport\n|year=1988\n|pages=226\u2013227\n|isbn=0-907969-38-0}}</ref> The following season, City again struggled. Cowan missed just one of the first 23 games, but after Christmas, he was restricted to just six; and without Cowan, Bradford finished 21st and were relegated to the Third Division (North).<ref>{{cite book\n|last=Frost\n|title=Bradford City A Complete Record 1903\u20131988\n|pages=228\u2013229}}</ref>\n\n===Managerial career===\nIn 1937, Cowan was appointed player-manager at [[Mossley A.F.C.|Mossley]]. He led the club to the seventh place in the [[Cheshire County League|Cheshire League]] and to the [[Manchester Challenge Shield]] title. On the pitch, he played 39 matches and scored one goal.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.mossleyweb.com/Managers1.htm\n|title=The Mossley Managers\n|accessdate=12 May 2008\n|publisher=Mossley AFC}}</ref> At the end of the season Cowan resigned to join [[Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton & Hove Albion]] coaching staff. In October 1945, a shortage of players resulted in Cowan taking to the field in a wartime match against [[A.F.C. Bournemouth|Bournemouth]]. Aged 44 years and 156 days, he became the oldest ever Brighton player.<ref>{{cite news\n |title      = Seagulls move for Beasant\n |url        = http://www.theargus.co.uk/news/5117287.Seagulls_move_for_Beasant/\n |publisher  = The Argus\n |date       = 30 January 2003\n |accessdate = 13 December 2017\n}}</ref> While at Brighton, Cowan started a [[physiotherapy]] business based near the [[Goldstone Ground]].<ref name=\"Clayton\"/>\n\nIn November 1946, Cowan became Manchester City manager, succeeding [[Wilf Wild]], who moved to a purely administrative role.<ref name=\"mre\"/> Cowan had been known for his motivational skills as a player, and was part of a new generation of managers who took responsibility for tactics and team selection, of which Cowan's contemporary and former teammate [[Matt Busby]] became the most well-known.
