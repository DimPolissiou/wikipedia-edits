She is now permanently moored as a [[museum ship]] on the [[River Thames]] in [[London]] and is operated by the [[Imperial War Museum]].\n\nConstruction of ''Belfast'', the first ship in the Royal Navy to be named after the capital city of [[Northern Ireland]] and one of ten Town-class cruisers, began in December 1936. She was launched on [[St Patrick's Day]] 1938. Commissioned in early August 1939 shortly before the outbreak of the [[World War II|Second World War]], ''Belfast'' was initially part of the British naval blockade against Germany. In November 1939, ''Belfast'' struck a German [[naval mine|mine]] and, in spite of fears that she would be scrapped, spent more than two years undergoing extensive repairs. ''Belfast'' returned to action in November 1942 with improved firepower, radar equipment, and armour. ''Belfast'' saw action escorting [[Arctic convoys of World War II|Arctic convoys]] to the [[Soviet Union]] during 1943 and in December 1943 played an important role in the [[Battle of North Cape]], assisting in the destruction of the German warship {{ship|German battleship|Scharnhorst||2}}. In June 1944, ''Belfast'' took part in [[Operation Overlord]] supporting the [[Normandy landings]]. In June 1945, she was redeployed to the Far East to join the [[British Pacific Fleet]], arriving shortly before the end of the Second World War. ''Belfast'' saw further combat action in {{nowrap|1950&ndash;52}} during the [[Korean War]] and underwent an extensive modernisation between 1956 and 1959. A number of further overseas commissions followed before she entered reserve in 1963.\n\nIn 1967, efforts were initiated to avert ''Belfast''{{'s}} expected scrapping and to preserve her as a museum ship. A joint committee of the Imperial War Museum, the [[National Maritime Museum]], and the [[Ministry of Defence (UK)|Ministry of Defence]] was established and then reported in June 1968 that preservation was practical. In 1971, however, the government decided against preservation, prompting the formation of the private HMS ''Belfast'' Trust to campaign for her preservation. The efforts of the Trust were successful, and the government transferred the ship to the Trust in July 1971. Brought to London, she was moored on the River Thames near [[Tower Bridge]] in the [[Pool of London]]. Opened to the public in October 1971, ''Belfast'' became a branch of the Imperial War Museum in 1978. A popular tourist attraction, ''Belfast'' receives over a quarter of a million visitors per year.<ref name=\"ALVA 2018 visitor numbers\" /> As a branch of a national museum and part of the [[National Historic Fleet]], ''Belfast'' is supported by the [[Department for Culture, Media and Sport]], admissions income, and the museum's commercial activities.\n\n==Design==\n[[File:HMS Belfast shells1.jpg|thumb|left|alt=\"A circular rack of conical shells. The shell cases are red, the rest of the room is white.|Shells in a rack in the underwater magazine serving the \"A\" turret of ''Belfast''.]]\n''Belfast'' is a cruiser of the [[Town-class cruiser (1936)|third Town class]]. The Town class had originated in 1933 as the [[Admiralty]]'s response to the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]]'s {{sclass-|Mogami|cruiser|2}}, an {{formatnum:11200}}-ton cruiser mounting fifteen {{convert|6|in|mm|adj=on|0}} guns with a top speed exceeding {{convert|35|kn|lk=in}}. The Admiralty's [[requirement]] called for a 9,000-ton cruiser, sufficiently armoured to withstand a direct hit from an {{convert|8|in|mm|adj=on|0}} shell, capable of {{convert|32|kn|km/h}} and mounting twelve 6-inch guns. Seaplanes carried aboard would enable shipping lanes to be patrolled over a wide area, and the class was also to be capable of its own anti-aircraft defence.{{sfn|Wingate |2004 |p=7}} Under the [[Director of Naval Construction]] the new design evolved during 1933.{{sfn|Watton|1985|p=6}} The lead ship of the new class, the 9,100-ton {{HMS|Southampton|83|6}}, and her [[Sister ship|sister]] {{HMS|Newcastle|C76|6}}, were ordered under the 1933 estimates.{{sfn|Wingate|2004|p=8}} Three more cruisers were built to this design, with a further three ships built to a slightly larger 9,400-ton design in 1935\u201336.{{sfn|Wingate|2004|p=8}} By 1935, however, the Admiralty was keen to improve the firepower of these cruisers to match the firepower of the Japanese ''Mogami'' and American {{sclass-|Brooklyn|cruiser|2}}s; both were armed with fifteen 6-inch guns.{{sfn|Watton|1985|p=6}} The Admiralty rejected a design featuring five triple turrets as impractical, while an alternative design fitting four quadruple turrets was rejected as an effective quadruple turret could not be developed.{{sfn|Watton|1985|pp=6\u20137}} In May 1936 the Admiralty decided to fit triple turrets, whose improved design would permit an increase in deck armour.{{sfn|Watton|1985|p=7}} This modified design became the 10,000-ton ''Edinburgh'' subclass, named after ''Belfast''{{'}}s sister ship {{HMS|Edinburgh|16|6}}.{{sfn|Wingate|2004|p=8}} ''Belfast'' was ordered from [[Harland and Wolff]] on 21 September 1936,{{sfn|Wingate|2004|p=9}} and her keel laid on 10 December 1936.{{sfn|Wingate|2004|p=9}} Her expected cost was \u00a32,141,514; of which the guns cost \u00a375,000 and the aircraft (two [[Supermarine Walrus]]es) \u00a366,500.<ref name=IWM1>{{cite web |url=http://hmsbelfast.iwm.org.uk/server/show/nav.125 |title=History of HMS Belfast: Building and Launch |year=2009 |website=Imperial War Museum |accessdate=8 April 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20080612093723/http://hmsbelfast.iwm.org.uk/server/show/nav.125 |archivedate=12 June 2008}}</ref> She was launched on [[Saint Patrick's Day]], 17 March 1938, by [[Anne Chamberlain]], the wife of Prime Minister [[Neville Chamberlain]].{{sfn|Wingate|2004|p=9}} The launch was filmed by [[Path\u00e9 News]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.britishpathe.com/video/mrs-chamberlain-opens-new-airport-at-belfast-and-l |title=Mrs Chamberlain Opens New Airport At Belfast And Launches HMS Belfast (1938) |website=British Path\u00e9 |accessdate=15 March 2013}}</ref> From March to August 1939, ''Belfast'' was fitted out and underwent sea trials.{{sfn|Wingate|2004|p=11}}{{sfn|Wingate|2004|p=9}}\n\n[[File:HMS Belfast - Boiler diagram.svg|thumb|Diagram of one of ''Belfast''{{'}}s boilers.]]When completed, ''Belfast'' had an [[overall length]] of {{convert|613|ft|6|in|m|1}}, a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|63|ft|4|in|m|1}} and a [[draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|17|ft|3|in|m|1}}.

Her first captain was [[Captain (naval)|Captain]] G A Scott with a crew of 761, and her first assignment was to the [[Home Fleet]]'s [[2nd Cruiser Squadron]]. On 14 August, ''Belfast'' took part in her first exercise, Operation [[German cruiser Admiral Hipper|''Hipper'']], in which she played the role of a German [[commerce raider]] attempting to escape into the Atlantic. By navigating the hazardous [[Pentland Firth]], ''Belfast'' successfully evaded the Home Fleet.{{sfn|Wingate|2004|p=33}}\n\nOn 31 August 1939 ''Belfast'' was transferred to the [[18th Cruiser Squadron]]. Based at [[Scapa Flow]] in the [[Orkney]] islands, 18th Cruiser Squadron was part of the British effort to impose a naval [[blockade]] on Germany. Germany [[Invasion of Poland|invaded Poland]] the following day, and Britain and France declared war on 3 September. At 11:40 that morning, ''Belfast'' received the message \u2018Commence hostilities at once against Germany\u2019.{{sfn|Lavery |2015 |p=77}} On 8 September ''Belfast'' put to sea from Scapa Flow with the [[battlecruiser]]s {{HMS|Hood||2}}, {{HMS|Renown|1916|2}}, her sister ship ''Edinburgh'' and four [[destroyer]]s, on a patrol intended to intercept German ships returning from Norway. In particular, they were to search for the [[Norddeutscher Lloyd]] liner {{SS|Europa|1928|2}}. No enemy vessels were found.{{sfn|Lavery |2015 |p=77}} On 25 September, ''Belfast'' took part in a fleet operation to recover the submarine {{HMS|Spearfish||2}}, during which the ship was attacked by German aircraft, but suffered no damage.{{sfn|Lavery |2015 |p=80}} On 1 October 1939 ''Belfast'' left Scapa Flow for a patrol in the North Sea. On 5 October ''Belfast'' intercepted and boarded a neutral Norwegian factory ship that was sailing in company with six whaling ships. {{Sfn |Lavery |2015 |p=81-82}} On 8 October the ship sighted the Swedish merchant ship ''C. P. Lilljevach'' but, in poor weather, did not intercept or board her. The following day she boarded ''Tai Yin'', a Norwegian ship. ''Tai Yin'' had been listed by the Admiralty as suspicious, so a [[prize crew]] from ''Belfast'' sailed her to Kirkwall for investigation.{{sfn|Lavery |2015 |p=82}} On 9 October ''Belfast'' intercepted a German liner, the 13,615-ton ''Cap Norte'', {{convert|50|mi|km}} north-west of the [[Faroe Islands]].

That night, the [[battleship]] {{HMS|Royal Oak|08|2}} was torpedoed by German submarine {{GS|U-47|1938|2}}, which had infiltrated the anchorage. On the morning following the sinking, ''Belfast'' left for [[Loch Ewe]].{{sfn|Lavery |2015 |p=85-86}}\n\nOn 10 November ''Belfast'' was taken off the northern patrol and reassigned to the 2nd Cruiser Squadron. This squadron was to form an independent striking force based at [[Rosyth]]. On 21 November, ''Belfast'' was to take part in the force's first sortie, a gunnery exercise. At 10:58&nbsp;am she struck a magnetic [[naval mine|mine]] while leaving the [[Firth of Forth]]. The mine broke ''Belfast''{{'}}s keel, and wrecked one of her engine and boiler rooms.{{sfn|Wingate|2004|pp=34\u201335}} Twenty officers and men required hospital treatment for injuries caused by the explosion, and a further 26 suffered minor injuries.

On 4 January 1940 ''Belfast'' was decommissioned to Care and Maintenance status, becoming the responsibility of [[Rosyth Dockyard]], and her crew dispersed to other vessels. By 28 June she had been repaired sufficiently to sail to [[HMNB Devonport|Devonport]], arriving on 30 June under the command of Lt Cdr H W Parkinson.{{sfn|Wingate|2004|pp=35\u201336}}\n\n[[File:Hms belfast mine damage.jpg|thumb|Photograph of ''Belfast''{{'}}s damaged hull, taken while the ship was drydocked for repairs.]]During her repairs, work was carried out to straighten, reconstruct and strengthen her hull.

Her armament was updated with newer 2-pounder pom-pom mountings, and her anti-aircraft armament improved with eighteen [[Oerlikon 20 mm cannon|20&nbsp;mm Oerlikon]] guns in five twin and eight single mountings, replacing two quadruple 0.5-inch Vickers guns. ''Belfast'' also received new fire control [[radar]]s for her main, secondary and anti-aircraft guns.

As ''Scharnhorst'' did so, she was intercepted by Force Two and sunk by the combined formations. ''Belfast'' played an important role in the battle; as flagship of the 10th Cruiser Squadron, she was among the first to encounter ''Scharnhorst'', and coordinated the squadron's defence of the convoy.

Originally part of the US Navy's [[Task Force 77 (United States Navy)|Task Force 77]], ''Belfast'' was detached in order to operate independently on 5 July 1950. During July and early August 1950, ''Belfast'' undertook coastal patrols and was based at [[Sasebo, Nagasaki|Sasebo]] in Japan's [[Nagasaki Prefecture]]. From 19 July ''Belfast'' supported troops fighting around Yongdok, accompanied by {{USS|Juneau|CL-119|6}}. That day ''Belfast'' fired an accurate 350-round bombardment from her 6-inch guns, and was praised by an American admiral as a \"straight-shooting ship\".<ref group=\"nb\">The admiral is not identified in Wingate (2004), but may have been Rear Admiral [[John Higgins (admiral)|John Higgins]], for whom ''Juneau'' was flagship.</ref>{{sfn|Wingate|2004|p=81}} On 6 August she sailed for the UK for a short (but needed) refit, after which she again set sail for the far east and arrived back at Sasebo on 31 January 1951.{{sfn|Wingate|2004|p=81}}\n[[File:HMS Belfast (C35) and HMS Ocean (R68) off Korea 1952.jpg|thumb|left|''Belfast'' cruising alongside {{HMS|Ocean|R68|2}} off Korea in 1952.]]\nDuring 1951 ''Belfast'' mounted a number of coastal patrols and bombarded a variety of targets. On 1 June she arrived at Singapore for refitting, arriving back on patrol on 31 August. In September 1951 ''Belfast'' provided anti-aircraft cover for a salvage operation to recover a crashed enemy [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15|MiG-15]] jet fighter. She conducted further bombardments and patrols before receiving a month's leave from operations, returning to action on 23 December.{{sfn|Wingate|2004|p=84}}\n\nIn 1952 ''Belfast'' continued her coastal patrol duties. On 29 July 1952 ''Belfast'' was hit by enemy fire while engaging an [[artillery battery]] on Wolsa-ri island. A 75&nbsp;mm shell struck a forward compartment, killing a British sailor of Chinese origin in his hammock and wounding four other Chinese ratings. This was the only time ''Belfast'' was hit by enemy fire during her Korean service. On 27 September 1952 ''Belfast'' was relieved by two other Town-class cruisers, {{HMS|Birmingham|C19|6}} and HMS&nbsp;''Newcastle'', and sailed back to the UK. She had steamed over {{convert|80000|mi|km}} in the combat zone and fired more than 8,000 rounds from her 6-inch guns during the Korean War.

Work began on 6 January 1956. Although described as only an extended refit, the cost was substantial for this large middle-aged cruiser, 5.5 million pounds<ref>{{cite book |last=Janitch |first=Michael |date=1977 |title=A Source Book of Twentieth Century Warships |location=London |publisher=Ward Lock |page=60 |isbn=978-0-70631-819-7}}</ref> Changes included: providing the new twin MK 5 40&nbsp;mm and the twin 4-inch mount with individual MRS8 directors; the 4-inch guns training and elevation speed was increased to 20 degrees a second; and protecting key parts of the ship against [[Weapon of mass destruction|nuclear, biological or chemical]] attack. This last consideration meant significantly enlarging and enclosing her [[Bridge (nautical)|bridge]], creating a two-tiered, five-sided superstructure which radically altered her appearance. The most significant change was better accommodations for a smaller crew more fitting of post-war needs, her tripod masts replaced with lattice masts, and timber decking replaced with steel everywhere except the quarterdeck. The overall effect was to create a cruiser significantly more habitable but different internally and to a degree in external appearance, from wartime cruisers but still essentially a surface warfare, 'anti [[Sverdlov-class cruiser|Sverdlov]]' cruiser, with anti aircraft defence, updated only for point defence, with 262 radar, locking only, 4&nbsp;km, out.{{sfn|Wingate|2004|pp=79-90}} ''Belfast'' recommissioned at Devonport on 12 May 1959.{{sfn|Wingate|2004|pp=87\u201390}} Her close-range armament was standardised to six twin Bofors guns, and her close-range fire direction similarly standardised to eight close-range blind fire directors fitted with [[List of World War II British naval radar#Type 262|Type 262]] radar.{{sfn|Watton|1985|p=14}} Her 1959 radar fit included two Type 274,lock and follow radar directors, for main armament direction, against sea and land targets, (other 1950s cruiser reconstructions of three Town cruisers and HMS ''Newfoundland'' and HMS ''Ceylon'', had only a single main 274 director, limiting their surface effectiveness) [[Type 277|Type 277Q]] and 293Q for height-finding and surface warning, Type 960M for air warning, and 974 for surface warning.{{sfn|Wingate|2004|p=88}} In order to save weight, her torpedo armament was removed.{{sfn|Wingate|2004|p=88}} Modern passive sonar type 174, 176 was installed and the cruiser quitened with rubber insulation of the propellor shaft.{{sfn|Wingate|2004}}{{page needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n''Belfast'' arrived in Singapore on 16 December 1959, and spent most of 1960 at sea on exercise, calling at ports in Hong Kong, Borneo, India, Ceylon (now [[Sri Lanka]]), Australia, the Philippines and Japan. On 31 January 1961, ''Belfast'' recommissioned, under the command of Captain [[Morgan Morgan-Giles]]. On her final foreign commission ''Belfast'' joined a number of exercises in the Far East, and in December 1961 she provided the British guard of honour at [[Tanganyika]]'s independence ceremony in [[Dar-es-Salaam]].{{sfn|Wingate|2004|pp=90\u201399}}\n\nIn 1961 plans were drawn up for conversion of ''Belfast'' to a hybrid helicopter cruiser for amphibious operations. The two aft 6-inch turrets would be removed to accommodate a helicopter deck and two hangars, capable of housing four [[Westland Wessex]] helicopters, while the 4-inch guns would be replaced by [[davit]]s for four [[Landing Craft Assault|LCA]] landing craft. Only one of the ship's two boiler rooms would be used, which together with the reductions in armament would allow the ship's crew to be reduced, freeing space to carry troops. Two infantry [[Company (military unit)|companies]], 30 officers and 230 other ranks, would be carried.

was built for the [[Royal Navy]]. She is now permanently moored as a [[museum ship]] on the [[River Thames]] in [[London]] and is operated by the [[Imperial War Museum]].\n\nConstruction of ''Belfast'', the first ship in the Royal Navy to be named after the capital city of [[Northern Ireland]] and one of ten Town-class cruisers, began in December 1936. She was launched on [[St Patrick's Day]] 1938. Commissioned in early August 1939 shortly before the outbreak of the [[World War II|Second World War]], ''Belfast'' was initially part of the British naval blockade against Germany. In November 1939, ''Belfast'' struck a German [[naval mine|mine]] and, in spite of fears that she would be scrapped, spent more than two years undergoing extensive repairs. ''Belfast'' returned to action in November 1942 with improved firepower, radar equipment, and armour. ''Belfast'' saw action escorting [[Arctic convoys of World War II|Arctic convoys]] to the [[Soviet Union]] during 1943 and in December 1943 played an important role in the [[Battle of North Cape]], assisting in the destruction of the German warship {{ship|German battleship|Scharnhorst||2}}. In June 1944, ''Belfast'' took part in [[Operation Overlord]] supporting the [[Normandy landings]]. In June 1945, she was redeployed to the Far East to join the [[British Pacific Fleet]], arriving shortly before the end of the Second World War. \"Belfast\" saw further combat action in {{nowrap|1950&ndash;52}} during the [[Korean War]] and underwent an extensive modernisation between 1956 and 1959. A number of further overseas commissions followed before she entered reserve in 1963.\n\nIn 1967, efforts were initiated to avert ''Belfast''{{'s}} expected scrapping and to preserve her as a museum ship. A joint committee of the Imperial War Museum, the [[National Maritime Museum]], and the [[Ministry of Defence (UK)|Ministry of Defence]] was established and then reported in June 1968 that preservation was practical. In 1971, however, the government decided against preservation, prompting the formation of the private HMS ''Belfast'' Trust to campaign for her preservation. The efforts of the Trust were successful, and the government transferred the ship to the Trust in July 1971. Brought to London, she was moored on the River Thames near [[Tower Bridge]] in the [[Pool of London]]. Opened to the public in October 1971, ''Belfast'' became a branch of the Imperial War Museum in 1978. A popular tourist attraction, ''Belfast'' receives over a quarter of a million visitors per year.<ref name=\"ALVA 2018 visitor numbers\" /> As a branch of a national museum and part of the [[National Historic Fleet]], ''Belfast'' is supported by the [[Department for Culture, Media and Sport]], admissions income, and the museum's commercial activities.\n\n==Design==\n[[File:HMS Belfast shells1.jpg|thumb|left|alt=\"A circular rack of conical shells.

As flagship of the 5th Cruiser Squadron, ''Belfast'' was the Far Eastern Station's headquarters ship during the April 1949 [[Amethyst Incident|''Amethyst'' Incident]], in which a British [[Sloop-of-war|sloop]], {{HMS|Amethyst|F116|6}}, was trapped in the [[Yangtze River]] by the communist [[People's Liberation Army]]. ''Belfast'' remained in Hong Kong during 1949, sailing for [[Singapore]] on 18 January 1950. There she underwent a minor refit between January to March 1950 and in June she joined the Far East Fleet's summer cruise.{{sfn|Wingate|2004|pp=73\u201376}} On 25 June 1950, while ''Belfast'' was visiting [[Hakodate, Hokkaid\u014d|Hakodate]] in Japan, North Korean forces crossed the [[38th parallel north|38th Parallel]], starting the [[Korean War]].{{sfn|Wingate|2004|p=76}}\n\n==Korean War 1950{{ndash}}52==\n[[File:HMS Belfast bombarding Korea.jpg|thumb|March 1951: At anchor, ''Belfast'' fires a salvo against enemy troop concentrations on the west coast of the Korean Peninsula.]]\n\nWith the outbreak of the Korean War, ''Belfast'' became part of the [[United Nations]] naval forces. Originally part of the US Navy's [[Task Force 77 (United States Navy)|Task Force 77]], ''Belfast'' was detached in order to operate independently on 5 July 1950. During July and early August 1950, ''Belfast'' undertook coastal patrols and was based at [[Sasebo, Nagasaki|Sasebo]] in Japan's [[Nagasaki Prefecture]]. From 19 July ''Belfast'' supported troops fighting around Yongdok, accompanied by {{USS|Juneau|CL-119|6}}. That day ''Belfast'' fired an accurate 350-round bombardment from her 6-inch guns, and was praised by an American admiral as a \"straight-shooting ship\".<ref group=\"nb\">The admiral is not identified in Wingate (2004), but may have been Rear Admiral [[John Higgins (admiral)|John Higgins]], for whom ''Juneau'' was flagship.</ref>{{sfn|Wingate|2004|p=81}} On 6 August she sailed for the UK for a short (but needed) refit, after which she again set sail for the far east and arrived back at Sasebo on 31 January 1951.{{sfn|Wingate|2004|p=81}}\n[[File:HMS Belfast (C35) and HMS Ocean (R68) off Korea 1952.jpg|thumb|left|''Belfast'' cruising alongside {{HMS|Ocean|R68|2}} off Korea in 1952.]]\nDuring 1951 ''Belfast'' mounted a number of coastal patrols and bombarded a variety of targets. On 1 June she arrived at Singapore for refitting, arriving back on patrol on 31 August. In September 1951 ''Belfast'' provided anti-aircraft cover for a salvage operation to recover a crashed enemy [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15|MiG-15]] jet fighter. She conducted further bombardments and patrols before receiving a month's leave from operations, returning to action on 23 December.{{sfn|Wingate|2004|p=84}}\n\nIn 1952 ''Belfast'' continued her coastal patrol duties. On 29 July 1952 ''Belfast'' was hit by enemy fire while engaging an [[artillery battery]] on Wolsa-ri island. A 75&nbsp;mm shell struck a forward compartment, killing a British sailor of Chinese origin in his hammock and wounding four other Chinese ratings. This was the only time ''Belfast'' was hit by enemy fire during her Korean service. On 27 September 1952 ''Belfast'' was relieved by two other Town-class cruisers, {{HMS|Birmingham|C19|6}} and HMS&nbsp;''Newcastle'', and sailed back to the UK. She had steamed over {{convert|80000|mi|km}} in the combat zone and fired more than 8,000 rounds from her 6-inch guns during the Korean War. She paid off in [[Chatham Dockyard|Chatham]] on 4 November 1952 and entered reserve at Devonport on 1 December.{{sfn|Wingate|2004|p=87}}\n\n==Modernisation and final commissions 1955&ndash;1963==\n[[File:HMS Belfast 4 db.jpg|thumb|upright|After modernisation; showing the enclosed bridge, lattice mast and twin [[Bofors 40 mm|40 mm Bofors]] mountings.]]\nIn reserve, ''Belfast''{{'}}s future was uncertain: post-war defence cuts made manpower-intensive cruisers excessively costly to operate, and it was not until March 1955 that the decision was taken to modernise ''Belfast''. Work began on 6 January 1956. Although described as only an extended refit, the cost was substantial for this large middle-aged cruiser, 5.5 million pounds<ref>{{cite book |last=Janitch |first=Michael |date=1977 |title=A Source Book of Twentieth Century Warships |location=London |publisher=Ward Lock |page=60 |isbn=978-0-70631-819-7}}</ref> Changes included: providing the new twin MK 5 40&nbsp;mm and the twin 4-inch mount with individual MRS8 directors; the 4-inch guns training and elevation speed was increased to 20 degrees a second; and protecting key parts of the ship against [[Weapon of mass destruction|nuclear, biological or chemical]] attack. This last consideration meant significantly enlarging and enclosing her [[Bridge (nautical)|bridge]], creating a two-tiered, five-sided superstructure which radically altered her appearance. The most significant change was better accommodations for a smaller crew more fitting of post-war needs, her tripod masts replaced with lattice masts, and timber decking replaced with steel everywhere except the quarterdeck. The overall effect was to create a cruiser significantly more habitable but different internally and to a degree in external appearance, from wartime cruisers but still essentially a surface warfare, 'anti [[Sverdlov-class cruiser|Sverdlov]]' cruiser, with anti aircraft defence, updated only for point defence, with 262 radar, locking only, 4&nbsp;km, out.{{sfn|Wingate|2004|pp=79-90}} ''Belfast'' recommissioned at Devonport on 12 May 1959.{{sfn|Wingate|2004|pp=87\u201390}} Her close-range armament was standardised to six twin Bofors guns, and her close-range fire direction similarly standardised to eight close-range blind fire directors fitted with [[List of World War II British naval radar#Type 262|Type 262]] radar.{{sfn|Watton|1985|p=14}} Her 1959 radar fit included two Type 274,lock and follow radar directors, for main armament direction, against sea and land targets, (other 1950s cruiser reconstructions of three Town cruisers and HMS ''Newfoundland'' and HMS ''Ceylon'', had only a single main 274 director, limiting their surface effectiveness) [[Type 277|Type 277Q]] and 293Q for height-finding and surface warning, Type 960M for air warning, and 974 for surface warning.{{sfn|Wingate|2004|p=88}} In order to save weight, her torpedo armament was removed.{{sfn|Wingate|2004|p=88}} Modern passive sonar type 174, 176 was installed and the cruiser quitened with rubber insulation of the propellor shaft.{{sfn|Wingate|2004}}{{page needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n''Belfast'' arrived in Singapore on 16 December 1959, and spent most of 1960 at sea on exercise, calling at ports in Hong Kong, Borneo, India, Ceylon (now [[Sri Lanka]]), Australia, the Philippines and Japan. On 31 January 1961, ''Belfast'' recommissioned, under the command of Captain [[Morgan Morgan-Giles]]. On her final foreign commission ''Belfast'' joined a number of exercises in the Far East, and in December 1961 she provided the British guard of honour at [[Tanganyika]]'s independence ceremony in [[Dar-es-Salaam]].{{sfn|Wingate|2004|pp=90\u201399}}\n\nIn 1961 plans were drawn up for conversion of ''Belfast'' to a hybrid helicopter cruiser for amphibious operations. The two aft 6-inch turrets would be removed to accommodate a helicopter deck and two hangars, capable of housing four [[Westland Wessex]] helicopters, while the 4-inch guns would be replaced by [[davit]]s for four [[Landing Craft Assault|LCA]] landing craft. Only one of the ship's two boiler rooms would be used, which together with the reductions in armament would allow the ship's crew to be reduced, freeing space to carry troops. Two infantry [[Company (military unit)|companies]], 30 officers and 230 other ranks, would be carried. The plan was rejected in December 1961, as the time required to carry out the conversions was too great.{{sfn|Waters|2019|pp=192\u2013194}}\n\n[[File:HMS Belfast (C35) at Pearl Harbor in 1962.jpg|left|thumb|''Belfast'' at [[Pearl Harbor]], Hawaii, in 1962.]]The ship left Singapore on 26 March 1962 for the UK, sailing east via Hong Kong, Guam and [[Pearl Harbor]], San Francisco, Seattle, British Columbia, Panama and Trinidad.

In January 1966 parts of the ship and power systems were reactivated and from May 1966 to 1970 she served as an accommodation ship (taking over those duties from ''Sheffield''), moored in [[Fareham]] Creek, for the Reserve Division at Portsmouth.{{sfn|Wingate|2004|p=101}} While ''Belfast'' lay at Fareham Creek the Imperial War Museum, Britain's national museum of twentieth-century conflict, became interested in preserving a 6-inch turret.

''Gambia'' had already severely deteriorated, so attention turned to the possibility of saving ''Belfast''. The Imperial War Museum, the [[National Maritime Museum]] and the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] established a joint committee, which reported in June 1968 that the scheme was practical and economic.

In the [[2002 Major League Baseball draft]], the [[Seattle Mariners]] drafted him out of high school in the First Round (28th overall). Mayberry chose not to sign, however, instead attending [[Stanford University]], and also playing for the [[United States national baseball team]] at the [[World University Baseball Championship]] in 2004, winning a gold medal.  After he played three years at Stanford, Mayberry was drafted again. The [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] selected him in the first round (19th overall) of the [[2005 Major League Baseball draft]].\n\nIn 2005, Mayberry was rated by ''[[Baseball America]]'' as the Best Athlete and Best Outfield Arm among all Texas Rangers minor leaguers. In 2006 he was rated by ''Baseball America'' as the Best Power Hitter, Best Athlete, and Best Outfield Arm among all Texas Rangers minor leaguers, and was named a [[Hawaii Winter Baseball|Hawaii Winter Baseball league]] post-season All Star. In 2007, Mayberry hit 30 [[home runs]] (tied for 11th among all minor leaguers), was named a [[California League]] mid-season All Star, and was named an [[Arizona Fall League]] Rising Star. On November 20, 2008, the Philadelphia Phillies traded for him. With the Phillies, Mayberry started in Triple-A, and was called up to the major league team in May. He hit a home run in his major league debut, but was sent back to the minors a few weeks later, and spent the majority of the 2009 and 2010 seasons there. Mayberry was named an MiLB.com 2010 Phillies Organization All Star. He returned to the major league squad in 2010 as a [[September callup]], and remained there, with the exception of a short stint in Triple-A in 2011. In 2011, Mayberry played over 100 games, splitting time between outfield and [[first baseman|first base]], as well as pinch hitting. Statistically, 2011 was his best major league season. He remained with the big-league club in 2012, and played predominantly in [[left field]] early in the season, and subsequently as the team's everyday [[center fielder]]. In 2012 and 2013 Mayberry\u2018s batting average declined.\n\nMayberry was used predominantly as a starting outfielder, despite some suggesting he was better suited as a platoon player. He hit for [[power hitter|power]], but struck out frequently. Mayberry was a good athlete, with good speed, but seldom stole any bases. Defensively, he was adequate, and possessed a strong and accurate arm. Mayberry has a degree in [[political science]] from Stanford. His father, [[John Mayberry|John Mayberry Sr.]], a first round draft pick, himself (1967, 6th overall), played in MLB for over a decade, hitting over 20 runs in eight separate seasons, and was a two-time [[American League]] (AL) All Star.\n\n==Early life==\nMayberry was born in Kansas City to John Sr. and Janice Mayberry.<ref name=autogenerated4>[http://www.gostanford.com/news/2013/4/17/208432413.aspx \"Player Bio: John Mayberry, Jr.\" GoStanford.com | Stanford Athletics<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> His father, a two-time All-Star first baseman, played Major League Baseball for 15 seasons (1968\u201382) with the Houston Astros, Kansas City Royals, Toronto Blue Jays, and New York Yankees.<ref name=autogenerated4 />\n\nHe attended [[Rockhurst High School]] in Kansas City, graduating in 2002.<ref name=autogenerated4 /> While there, Mayberry was named First Team All-State and First Team All-Metro in 2001, after he hit .480 with eight homers.<ref name=autogenerated4 /> ''USA Today'' named him a first-team 2002 All-USA player, the National High School Baseball Coaches Association named him a 2002 third-team [[All-American]], he was named the 2002 Missouri Gatorade High School Baseball Player of the Year, he was ranked No. 40 on ''[[Baseball America]]'''s 2002 Top 100 High School Prospect List, and he was named 2002 All-Region by the [[American Baseball Coaches Association]] as he hit .432 with nine homers.<ref name=autogenerated4 /> He also played [[basketball]], averaging 14.0 points and 10.0 rebounds per game in his senior year as a forward.<ref name=\"stanford\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gostanford.com/ViewArticle.dbml?&DB_OEM_ID=30600&ATCLID=208432413|title=#25 \u2013 John Mayberry Jr.|publisher=Stanford University Athletic Department|date=May 30, 2005|work=GoStanford.com|accessdate=June 19, 2009}}</ref>\n\nMayberry was drafted by the [[Seattle Mariners]] in the First Round of the [[2002 Major League Baseball draft]] (28th overall) but did not sign, choosing instead to attend [[Stanford University]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/draft/?query_type=year_round&year_ID=2002&draft_round=1&draft_type=junreg|title=1st Round of the June 2002 Draft|work=Baseball-Reference.com|accessdate=June 19, 2009}}</ref><ref name=\"stanford\"/> He was the highest-drafted player from the 2002 draft who chose to attend a four-year college instead of signing a contract.<ref name=\"stanford\"/><ref>{{cite web|last=Kwietkauski|first=Janelle|title=John Mayberry Jr.|url=http://www.gostanford.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=30600&ATCLID=208077907|work=GoStanford.com|publisher=Stanford University|accessdate=March 15, 2014|date=May 2, 2004}}</ref>\n\n==College==\nMayberry played three years for the [[Stanford Cardinal baseball]] team, and formed the heart of Stanford's [[batting order (baseball)|batting order]] along with fellow future major league infielder [[Jed Lowrie]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Eymer|first=Rick|title=The season is over too early|url=http://www.paloaltoonline.com/weekly/morgue/2004/2004_06_09.stanbase.shtml|accessdate=March 7, 2014|newspaper=[[Palo Alto Weekly]]|date=June 9, 2004}}</ref> As a freshman in 2003, he had a 16-game [[hitting streak]], batted .299, and hit four [[home run]]s and six triples (5th in the [[Pac-10 Conference]]) with 33 [[runs batted in]] (RBIs).<ref name=\"stanford\"/><ref name=\"cube\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thebaseballcube.com/players/M/John-Mayberry-1.shtml|title=John Mayberry|publisher=The Baseball Cube|accessdate=June 19, 2009}}</ref> He earned Freshman All-American honors from ''[[Collegiate Baseball]]'' ([[Louisville Slugger]]).<ref name=autogenerated4 /> ''Baseball America'' rated him as the best college athlete among its top 200 prospects, and the 3rd-best power hitter among them.<ref name=autogenerated3>[http://m.mlb.com/player/460055/john-mayberry-jr John Mayberry Jr. Stats, Fantasy & News | MLB.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> During the summer of 2003, he also played for the [[Yarmouth-Dennis Red Sox]] of the [[Cape Cod Baseball League]], batting .375.<ref name=\"stanford\"/>\n\nAs a sophomore in 2004, he batted .333 with 16 home runs (tied for 2nd in the Conference), 62 RBIs (tied for 3rd in the Conference), and 9 stolen bases with a .625 slugging percentage (3rd in the Conference).<ref name=\"cube\"/><ref name=autogenerated1>[http://www.thebaseballcube.com/seasons/review.asp?Y=2004&L=Pac10&Page=Awards 2004 Pacific-10 Conference -

The series debuted on July 19, 1995, and ended on May 9, 2007. This allowed ''Road Rules'' a total of 14 seasons and 12 years on the air.\n\nThe series followed five to six strangers, between the ages of 18 and 24, stripped of their money and restricted to a life in an [[Recreational vehicle|RV]], traveling from location to location. The strangers were guided by a set of clues and missions to complete at each location. It was nominated for an [[Emmy Award]] in 2001.\n\nThe series was a pioneer in travel/adventure/reward reality television (together with [[Mark Burnett (executive producer)|Mark Burnett]]'s ''[[Eco-Challenge]]'' productions). ''Road Rules'' was created by [[Jonathan Murray]] and [[Mary-Ellis Bunim]] of [[Bunim/Murray Productions]].

The concept was simple, abandon five strangers on the road, take away their money, have them drive around in an RV completing missions and doing odd jobs for money, and if they lasted to the end of the trip, they would win a \"handsome reward\". It was touted as ''The Real World'' on an RV, but as the show progressed, several changes were made to the show for various reasons, mostly having to do with causing excitement and raising sagging ratings.\n\n===Europe (Season 3)===\nIn its third season, producers of the show took production to the next level by deciding to move the show from the United States to Europe. While the first two seasons were not themed according to the series' location, the third season introduced the subtitle into the concept which would usually strand the Roadies in different locations around the world.\n\n===Islands (Season 4)===\nFor the first time, the RV was completely abandoned for a short time in favor of an alternate mode of transportation. The cast traveled in and around the Caribbean islands and for a short time traveled on a [[catamaran]]. This season also competed against the Boston season of ''[[The Real World]]'' in San Juan, Puerto Rico, planting the seeds for the ''[[Real World/Road Rules Challenge]]'' and future face-offs.\n\n===Northern Trail (Season 5)===\nChanging the dynamic of the cast in hopes of creating more drama by including more people in the RV, an additional cast member was included, changing the number of cast members from five to six. Jon is considered the \"stand out\" of the season. With his zany antics and half-baked notions of romantic hijinks,  he became both one of the most loved and conversely despised characters in the show's history. He later became known as 'Boston's Favourite Son'.\n\n===Semester at Sea (Season 8)===\nEnticed by the idea of sailing around the world, producers put the cast on the [[University of Pittsburgh|University of Pittsburgh's]] [[Semester at Sea]] educational program. For the first time in any season, in order for the cast to get their handsome reward, the cast needed to complete coursework aboard the ship. Prior to this, cast members only needed to get to the end of the trip, and would not be penalized for refusing to do a mission.\n\n===Maximum Velocity Tour (Season 9)===\nDue to an exaggerated trend of sagging ratings, some say due to the Semester at Sea season, the show underwent a major re-tooling. The Maximum Velocity Tour represents when the series transitioned from a documentary-style reality show to an entertainment reality show. The show was brought back to the US and given a \"game show\" format. At the helm of a trip was a fictional character named the \"Road Master\" completed. After the cast would complete a mission, they would have points added to the group pool for the end prize and if they failed to complete a mission, they would lose the money.\n\n===The Quest (Season 10)===\nProducers continued to re-tool the show. This time, if the cast members lost two missions, they would have to vote out a cast member. Any additional mission lost after that, another cast member would be voted off. Also, instead of adding money to a group pool, the cast competed each mission for a \"key\" to the handsome reward. The \"keys\" were placed in the RV on a large board where each \"key\" represented a virtue the cast learned in that mission. For this season, the \"key\" would be represented as part of a crest. If the cast lost a mission, they would not receive the \"key\" until they voted off a cast member. Jisela Delgado was the first cast member to be voted off in the series. Katie Doyle was the first replacement in the series. The series remained largely unchanged after this season, although each subsequent series had its own variation on the rules of the game.\n\n===Viewers' Revenge (Season 14)===\nAfter the series' 13th season, MTV decided not to renew the series, giving the official status of \"on hiatus\" for four years before being officially cancelled. In March 2005, Bunim-Murray Productions pitched the idea of an interactive format to the show in which viewers at home would be a part of the series, and running the series in real time in order for the viewers at home to have a say in the competition; nothing came of this concept.\n\n== ''Road Rules'' face-offs ==\nSetting up the idea for ''The Real World/Road Rules Challenge'', the face-offs have come to be an instrumental part of each season. The current cast competes either with a current ''[[The Real World]]'' cast who would be filming their series parallel to theirs or a former Road Rules cast, if Real World was ever out of its production season. The first official face-off, between the Islands and Boston casts gained such high ratings, that a spin-off series was begun, the ever-popular Challenges, and a pattern in most seasons where the cast would compete against another cast for a separate prize.\n\n*'''''First Adventure''''' - No face-off during this season. Although cast member Mark initially appeared on the ''Real World: San Francisco'' season as one of three possible replacements for ousted housemate, Puck. The housemates chose Jo over Mark.\n*'''Second Adventure''' vs. ''[[The Real World: Miami|Real World: Miami]]'' - The Road Rules cast posed as house cleaners and stole the Miami's cast eight-ball. They did so successfully. Timmy fooled Miami's Dan and Cynthia who were obviously suspicious of the unannounced cleaning crew.\n*'''''Europe''''' - No face-off.\n*'''''Islands''''' vs. ''[[The Real World: Boston|Real World: Boston]]'' - The casts competed in a series of competitions in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Prior to each event, two random people from the Boston cast were required to sit out in order for the number of people on each team to be even. The first event was to get each teammate through a web of wires. Each teammate had to pass through a different hole and could not touch the sides. The second event was to get each teammate from one platform to another using only a piece of wood that was not long enough to bridge the gap. The third event was to have all 5 teammates balance on a wooden cube at the same time. The fourth event was to have each teammate climb a wooden wall, and the final event was a tug of war. The Real World Boston won the first three events, and the Road Rules Islands cast won the final two. Syrus, while competing in the second mission, injured his shin attempting to jump from one platform to the other without using the board. The Islands crew, who desperately needed money at that time asked the Boston cast to split their winnings. The Boston cast declined to do so. They also played paintball with a team of former Road Rulers from different seasons at the beginning of their season. (Los/Christian/Devin/Effie/Michelle with special guest Timmy as a referee) The previous Road Rulers won two of the three contests, leaving the Road Rules Islands cast with only $400.\n*'''''Northern Trail''''' vs. ''[[Road Rules: All Stars]]'' - The casts competed in a series of Olympic-themed games including luge, ski jumping, and figure skating. The Olympic-theme was due in part to the fact that the casts were competing in the Olympic facilities at Lake Placid, New York. The competition consisted of 5 events: a two-man kayak, a one-man kayak, two individual luges, ski jumping, and figure skating. Each person had to compete in at least one event but could not compete in more than two. Road Rules won the two man kayak and the luge while the Real World All-Stars won the individual kayak and the ski jumping events. At the figure skating competition, Noah and Dan edged out Sean and Cynthia to give Northern Trail the victory. The Northern Trail handed the keys off to their RV, which the All-Stars cast used for their season.\n*'''''Down Under''''' vs. ''[[The Real World: Seattle|Real World: Seattle]]'' - The cast competed in the \"Aqua Games\" in Seattle's main harbor. They competed in various games, including holding onto the back of a raft attached to a seadoo, jumping into rings from a platform, and the finale: a bull-riding contest. Nathan won the competition for the Seattle cast, while Christina and Susie both took the competition as a joke.\n*'''''Latin America''''' vs. ''Road Rules: Down Under'' - The cast competed in Veracruz, Mexico in a series of games. The Down Under cast took the prize, but the more serious implication of this face-off was when Abe of the Latin America cast hooked up with Susie in the RV. This started the tension between Abe and Gladys, which led to Gladys hitting Abe and being sent home.\n*'''''Semester at Sea''''' - Did not do a face-off. Various students on the Semester at Sea program participated in various missions during this season.\n*'''''Maximum Velocity Tour''''' vs. ''[[The Real World: New Orleans|Real World: New Orleans]]'' - In a throwback to the very first face-off, the Maximum Velocity Tour cast worked with a Make-A-Wish child to pull off a sting on the Real World: New Orleans cast. They included the Make-A-Wish child in the mission, as the cast posed as Make-A-Wish ambassadors to distract the cast members while James and Laterrian jumped a back wall to steal the New Orleans' cast robotic dog. Hearing that the cast was in town, Melissa of the New Orleans cast hid the eight-ball in anticipation of the cast stealing it. This cast also competed in Los Angeles, CA against the cast of the first season of [[Making the Band]] ([[O-Town]]) in which O-Town won. They also competed against a group of winners from an MTV.com contest in Provo, Utah, which Road Rules won, and competed against the Playboy Extreme Team.\n*'''''The Quest''''' vs. ''[[The Real World: Back to New York|Real World: Back to New York]]'' - The casts met up in Morocco. These two casts met up after spending a week in Palm Spring during casting. Members of each cast had already made friends and enemies, creating instant drama and the casts playing practical jokes on each other. In direct contrast to her competitive persona on the Challenges, Back to New York's Coral and fellow cast member Nicole refused to compete in a mud wrestling challenge. This left Back to New York's Lori and Rachel to compete alone against the Road Rules girls. In a grueling mud wrestling competition, Road Rules won because Coral and Nicole refused to compete.<!--not clear why-->\n*'''''Campus Crawl''''' vs. ''[[The Real World: Las Vegas|Real World: Las Vegas]]'' - The Campus Crawl cast first had to take a photograph with one of the Las Vegas cast members handcuffed to the bathtub. Because Raquel had met Steven of Las Vegas in the College Station casting call, Raquel was able to coax Steven to show her and Rachel the Las Vegas suite. Not knowing that the two were from Road Rules, they were able to handcuff and photograph Steven. The cast competed at Lake Red Rock near Las Vegas, Nevada which The Real World won.\n*'''''South Pacific''''' vs. ''Road Rules Campus Crawl'' - This cast competed in a marathon challenge, in which the cast was required to compete in different games but were not allowed to sleep during the 48-hour period. In the last competition, in which they had to remember various details in the past 48 hours, the Campus Crawl cast pulled off a win.\n*'''''X-Treme''''' vs. ''Road Rules: South Pacific'' - The two casts competed in a series of games which concludes with a boxing match. The X-Treme cast beat the South Pacific cast.\n*'''''Viewers' Revenge''''' vs. ''Pit Crew''. Roadies beat out the Pit Crew in a mission that had players carrying tires from sand dunes. They also beat the Pit Crew in a mission that involved weight lifting and weight puzzles, along with a football game. The final challenge was carrying boxes across semis <!--explain--> and dropping them into the hole; Pit Crew finally won, making the score 3-1.\n\n== See also ==\n* ''[[MTV Roadies|Roadies]]'', an [[MTV India]] version of the same concept\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://roadrules.mtv.com MTV's official ''Road Rules'' website]\n* [http://www.mtv.ca/roadrules/ MTV.ca's official Road Rules website]\n* [http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,297946,00.html Entertainment Weekly] 'Road' Warriors, Retrieved March 2009\n* {{tv.com show|road-rules|Road Rules}}\n\n{{RWSeasons}}\n{{MTV Network programs}}\n\n[[Category:Television shows set in Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Television series by Bunim/Murray Productions]]\n[[Category:1995 American television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2007 American television series endings]]\n[[Category:1990s American television series]]\n[[Category:2000s American reality television series]]\n[[Category:MTV reality television series]]\n[[Category:Road Rules|*]]\n", "text_old": "{{About||general usage|Traffic#Rules of the road}}\n{{More citations needed|date=September 2014}}\n{{Infobox television\n| show_name                = Road Rules\n| image                    = \n| caption                  =\n| genre                    = Reality\n| opentheme                = \n| creator                  = {{Plainlist|\n* [[Mary-Ellis Bunim]]\n* [[Jonathan Murray]]\n}}\n| developer                = \n| starring                 = \n| country                  = United States\n| language                 = English\n| num_seasons              = 14\n| num_episodes             = 220\n| producer                 = \n| executive_producer       = {{Plainlist|\n* Joey Carson\n* [[Jonathan Murray]]\n* Rick de Oliveira\n* Rick Telles\n* Bruce Toms\n}}\n| runtime                  = 30 minutes\n| company                  = [[Bunim/Murray Productions]]\n| distributor              = \n| network                  = MTV \n| picture_format           = \n| audio_format             = \n| first_aired              = {{Start date|1995|7|19}}\n| last_aired               = {{End date|2007|5|9}}\n| related                  = {{Plainlist|\n* ''[[The Real World (TV series)|The Real World]]''\n* ''[[The Challenge (TV series)|The Challenge]]''\n}}\n}}\n'''''Road Rules''''' is an [[MTV]] [[reality show]] that was a [[sister show]] of the network's flagship reality show, ''[[The Real World (TV series)|The Real World]]''. The series debuted on July 19, 1995, and ended on May 9, 2007. This allowed ''Road Rules'' a total of 14 seasons and 12 years on the air.\n\nThe series followed five to six strangers, between the ages of 18 and 24, stripped of their money and restricted to a life in an [[Recreational vehicle|RV]], traveling from location to location. The strangers were guided by a set of clues and missions to complete at each location. It was nominated for an [[Emmy Award]] in 2001.\n\nThe series was a pioneer in travel/adventure/reward reality television (together with [[Mark Burnett (executive producer)|Mark Burnett]]'s ''[[Eco-Challenge]]'' productions).

The concept was simple, abandon five strangers on the road, take away their money, have them drive around in an RV completing missions and doing odd jobs for money, and if they lasted to the end of the trip, they would win a \"handsome reward\". It was touted as ''The Real World'' on an RV, but as the show progressed, several changes were made to the show for various reasons, mostly having to do with causing excitement and raising sagging ratings.\n\n===Europe (Season 3)===\nIn its third season, producers of the show took production to the next level by deciding to move the show from the United States to Europe. While the first two seasons were not themed according to the series' location, the third season introduced the subtitle into the concept which would usually strand the Roadies in different locations around the world.\n\n===Islands (Season 4)===\nFor the first time, the RV was completely abandoned for a short time in favor of an alternate mode of transportation. The cast traveled in and around the Caribbean islands and for a short time traveled on a [[catamaran]]. This season also competed against the Boston season of ''[[The Real World]]'' in San Juan, Puerto Rico, planting the seeds for the ''[[Real World/Road Rules Challenge]]'' and future face-offs.\n\n===Northern Trail (Season 5)===\nChanging the dynamic of the cast in hopes of creating more drama by including more people in the RV, an additional cast member was included, changing the number of cast members from five to six. Jon is considered the \"stand out\" of the season. With his zany antics and half-baked notions of romantic hijinks,  he became both one of the most loved and conversely despised characters in the show's history. He later became known as 'Boston's Favourite Son'.\n\n===Semester at Sea (Season 8)===\nEnticed by the idea of sailing around the world, producers put the cast on the [[University of Pittsburgh|University of Pittsburgh's]] [[Semester at Sea]] educational program. For the first time in any season, in order for the cast to get their handsome reward, the cast needed to complete coursework aboard the ship. Prior to this, cast members only needed to get to the end of the trip, and would not be penalized for refusing to do a mission.\n\n===Maximum Velocity Tour (Season 9)===\nDue to an exaggerated trend of sagging ratings, some say due to the Semester at Sea season, the show underwent a major re-tooling. The Maximum Velocity Tour represents when the series transitioned from a documentary-style reality show to an entertainment reality show. The show was brought back to the US and given a \"game show\" format. At the helm of a trip was a fictional character named the \"Road Master\" completed. After the cast would complete a mission, they would have points added to the group pool for the end prize and if they failed to complete a mission, they would lose the money.\n\n===The Quest (Season 10)===\nProducers continued to re-tool the show. This time, if the cast members lost two missions, they would have to vote out a cast member. Any additional mission lost after that, another cast member would be voted off. Also, instead of adding money to a group pool, the cast competed each mission for a \"key\" to the handsome reward. The \"keys\" were placed in the RV on a large board where each \"key\" represented a virtue the cast learned in that mission. For this season, the \"key\" would be represented as part of a crest. If the cast lost a mission, they would not receive the \"key\" until they voted off a cast member. Jisela Delgado was the first cast member to be voted off in the series. Katie Doyle was the first replacement in the series. The series remained largely unchanged after this season, although each subsequent series had its own variation on the rules of the game.\n\n===Viewers' Revenge (Season 14)===\nAfter the series' 13th season, MTV decided not to renew the series, giving the official status of \"on hiatus\" for four years before being officially cancelled. In March 2005, Bunim-Murray Productions pitched the idea of an interactive format to the show in which viewers at home would be a part of the series, and running the series in real time in order for the viewers at home to have a say in the competition; nothing came of this concept.\n\n== ''Road Rules'' face-offs ==\nSetting up the idea for ''The Real World/Road Rules Challenge'', the face-offs have come to be an instrumental part of each season. The current cast competes either with a current ''[[The Real World]]'' cast who would be filming their series parallel to theirs or a former Road Rules cast, if Real World was ever out of its production season. The first official face-off, between the Islands and Boston casts gained such high ratings, that a spin-off series was begun, the ever-popular Challenges, and a pattern in most seasons where the cast would compete against another cast for a separate prize.\n\n*'''''First Adventure''''' - No face-off during this season. Although cast member Mark initially appeared on the ''Real World: San Francisco'' season as one of three possible replacements for ousted housemate, Puck. The housemates chose Jo over Mark.\n*'''Second Adventure''' vs. ''[[The Real World: Miami|Real World: Miami]]'' - The Road Rules cast posed as house cleaners and stole the Miami's cast eight-ball. They did so successfully. Timmy fooled Miami's Dan and Cynthia who were obviously suspicious of the unannounced cleaning crew.\n*'''''Europe''''' - No face-off.\n*'''''Islands''''' vs. ''[[The Real World: Boston|Real World: Boston]]'' - The casts competed in a series of competitions in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Prior to each event, two random people from the Boston cast were required to sit out in order for the number of people on each team to be even. The first event was to get each teammate through a web of wires. Each teammate had to pass through a different hole and could not touch the sides. The second event was to get each teammate from one platform to another using only a piece of wood that was not long enough to bridge the gap. The third event was to have all 5 teammates balance on a wooden cube at the same time. The fourth event was to have each teammate climb a wooden wall, and the final event was a tug of war. The Real World Boston won the first three events, and the Road Rules Islands cast won the final two. Syrus, while competing in the second mission, injured his shin attempting to jump from one platform to the other without using the board. The Islands crew, who desperately needed money at that time asked the Boston cast to split their winnings. The Boston cast declined to do so. They also played paintball with a team of former Road Rulers from different seasons at the beginning of their season. (Los/Christian/Devin/Effie/Michelle with special guest Timmy as a referee) The previous Road Rulers won two of the three contests, leaving the Road Rules Islands cast with only $400.\n*'''''Northern Trail''''' vs. ''[[Road Rules: All Stars]]'' - The casts competed in a series of Olympic-themed games including luge, ski jumping, and figure skating. The Olympic-theme was due in part to the fact that the casts were competing in the Olympic facilities at Lake Placid, New York. The competition consisted of 5 events: a two-man kayak, a one-man kayak, two individual luges, ski jumping, and figure skating. Each person had to compete in at least one event but could not compete in more than two. Road Rules won the two man kayak and the luge while the Real World All-Stars won the individual kayak and the ski jumping events. At the figure skating competition, Noah and Dan edged out Sean and Cynthia to give Northern Trail the victory. The Northern Trail handed the keys off to their RV, which the All-Stars cast used for their season.\n*'''''Down Under''''' vs. ''[[The Real World: Seattle|Real World: Seattle]]'' - The cast competed in the \"Aqua Games\" in Seattle's main harbor. They competed in various games, including holding onto the back of a raft attached to a seadoo, jumping into rings from a platform, and the finale: a bull-riding contest. Nathan won the competition for the Seattle cast, while Christina and Susie both took the competition as a joke.\n*'''''Latin America''''' vs. ''Road Rules: Down Under'' - The cast competed in Veracruz, Mexico in a series of games. The Down Under cast took the prize, but the more serious implication of this face-off was when Abe of the Latin America cast hooked up with Susie in the RV. This started the tension between Abe and Gladys, which led to Gladys hitting Abe and being sent home.\n*'''''Semester at Sea''''' - Did not do a face-off. Various students on the Semester at Sea program participated in various missions during this season.\n*'''''Maximum Velocity Tour''''' vs. ''[[The Real World: New Orleans|Real World: New Orleans]]'' - In a throwback to the very first face-off, the Maximum Velocity Tour cast worked with a Make-A-Wish child to pull off a sting on the Real World: New Orleans cast. They included the Make-A-Wish child in the mission, as the cast posed as Make-A-Wish ambassadors to distract the cast members while James and Laterrian jumped a back wall to steal the New Orleans' cast robotic dog. Hearing that the cast was in town, Melissa of the New Orleans cast hid the eight-ball in anticipation of the cast stealing it. This cast also competed in Los Angeles, CA against the cast of the first season of [[Making the Band]] ([[O-Town]]) in which O-Town won. They also competed against a group of winners from an MTV.com contest in Provo, Utah, which Road Rules won, and competed against the Playboy Extreme Team.\n*'''''The Quest''''' vs. ''[[The Real World: Back to New York|Real World: Back to New York]]'' - The casts met up in Morocco. These two casts met up after spending a week in Palm Spring during casting. Members of each cast had already made friends and enemies, creating instant drama and the casts playing practical jokes on each other. In direct contrast to her competitive persona on the Challenges, Back to New York's Coral and fellow cast member Nicole refused to compete in a mud wrestling challenge. This left Back to New York's Lori and Rachel to compete alone against the Road Rules girls. In a grueling mud wrestling competition, Road Rules won because Coral and Nicole refused to compete.<!--not clear why-->\n*'''''Campus Crawl''''' vs. ''[[The Real World: Las Vegas|Real World: Las Vegas]]'' - The Campus Crawl cast first had to take a photograph with one of the Las Vegas cast members handcuffed to the bathtub. Because Raquel had met Steven of Las Vegas in the College Station casting call, Raquel was able to coax Steven to show her and Rachel the Las Vegas suite. Not knowing that the two were from Road Rules, they were able to handcuff and photograph Steven. The cast competed at Lake Red Rock near Las Vegas, Nevada which The Real World won.\n*'''''South Pacific''''' vs. ''Road Rules Campus Crawl'' - This cast competed in a marathon challenge, in which the cast was required to compete in different games but were not allowed to sleep during the 48-hour period. In the last competition, in which they had to remember various details in the past 48 hours, the Campus Crawl cast pulled off a win.\n*'''''X-Treme''''' vs. ''Road Rules: South Pacific'' - The two casts competed in a series of games which concludes with a boxing match. The X-Treme cast beat the South Pacific cast.\n*'''''Viewers' Revenge''''' vs. ''Pit Crew''. Roadies beat out the Pit Crew in a mission that had players carrying tires from sand dunes. They also beat the Pit Crew in a mission that involved weight lifting and weight puzzles, along with a football game. The final challenge was carrying boxes across semis <!--explain--> and dropping them into the hole; Pit Crew finally won, making the score 3-1.\n\n== See also ==\n* ''[[MTV Roadies|Roadies]]'', an [[MTV India]] version of the same concept\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://roadrules.mtv.com MTV's official ''Road Rules'' website]\n* [http://www.mtv.ca/roadrules/ MTV.ca's official Road Rules website]\n* [http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,297946,00.html Entertainment Weekly] 'Road' Warriors, Retrieved March 2009\n* {{tv.com show|road-rules|Road Rules}}\n\n{{RWSeasons}}\n{{MTV Network programs}}\n\n[[Category:Television shows set in Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Television series by Bunim/Murray Productions]]\n[[Category:1995 American television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2007 American television series endings]]\n[[Category:1990s American television series]]\n[[Category:2000s American reality television series]]\n[[Category:MTV reality television series]]\n[[Category:Road Rules|*]]\n", "name_user": "Eriru", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_Rules"}

He represented his country at schoolboy, youth and Under-21 level.\n\n==Biography==\nKendall, a [[Goalkeeper (football)|goalkeeper]], joined [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] as an apprentice in March 1975, aged 16. He signed professional forms in July 1976, and went on to make his league debut on 4 November 1978 in a 2\u20132 draw at [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich]].\n\nHowever, although he spent four seasons with Spurs, he never managed to make the goalkeeper's position his own. His final full season on the club's books saw him spend a nine-game loan period, during which he saved penalties from [[Steve Neville]] of [[Exeter City]] and [[Mark Smith (footballer born 1960)|Mark Smith]] of [[Sheffield Wednesday]], at [[Football League Third Division|Division 3]] [[Chesterfield F.C.|Chesterfield]], returning to Tottenham after [[Barry Daines]] was injured during an FA Cup-tie against [[Manchester United]]. He started the 1980-81 season as first choice, but eventually lost his place in competition with Daines and  [[Milija Aleksic]]. He was affectionately known to the fans as \"Bunter\".\n\nHe signed for [[Newport County A.F.C.|Newport County]] then of Division 3 for a club record \u00a345,000 in September 1980 during the most successful period in the club's long history. Kendall was part of the team that won promotion and the [[Welsh Cup]] and in the subsequent season reached the quarter-final of the 1981 [[European Cup Winners Cup]].\n\nHe left Newport as they headed for relegation to Division 4, for [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] in January 1986.<ref>[http://www.neilbrown.newcastlefans.com/newport/newport.html Newport County A-Z of transfers]</ref> Upon joining, Wolves were languishing in the fourth tier, but Kendall became an ever-present part of the side that went on to win back-to-back promotions and lift the [[Football League Trophy]] at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]]. His tally of 28 clean sheets during a season (set in [[1987-88 in English football|1987/88]]) is a club record.\n\nThe goalkeeper returned to his native Wales after 4 years at [[Molineux Stadium|Molineux]], joining [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]] in Summer 1990. He won a second [[Welsh Cup]] of his career, but was largely only a back-up goalkeeper during his time with the ''Swans''. He played in the European Cup Winners Cup tie against [[Monaco]] in 1991 when the rules stated that teams could only field 3 foreigners and Swansea had to find 12 Welshmen among their players, the second leg ending in a 0\u20138 defeat.\n\nHis two seasons with the club saw him play 12 league games, a spell which also saw him loaned out to [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] to gain playing time. However, after keeping a clean sheet in his first appearance for the ''Clarets'', he conceded 5 (at [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]]) in his second which saw his loan ended.\n\nKendall retired from professional football aged 34 and became a police officer in the Gwent constabulary.
