The representatives are members of parliament in their respective countries or areas and are elected by those parliaments. The Council holds ordinary sessions each year in October/November and usually one extra session per year with a specific theme.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council|title=The Nordic Council|website=Nordic cooperation}}</ref> The Council's official languages are [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], and [[Swedish language|Swedish]], though it uses only Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish as its [[working language]]s.<ref name=\"languages\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.norden.org/en/information/nordic-languages|title=The Nordic languages|website=Nordic cooperation|access-date=4 February 2020}}</ref> These three comprise the first language of around 80% of the region's population and are learned as a second or foreign language by the remaining 20%.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.norden.org/en/fakta-om-norden-1/language|title=Language|date=6 August 2008|access-date=1 June 2018|language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn 1971, the Nordic Council of Ministers, an [[intergovernmental organisation|intergovernmental]] forum, was established to complement the Council.

Following the war, the [[Nordic countries]] pursued the idea of a [[Scandinavian defence union]] to ensure their mutual defence. However, Finland, due to its [[Paasikivi\u2013Kekkonen doctrine|Paasikivi-Kekkonen policy of neutrality]] and [[Finno-Soviet Treaty of 1948|FCMA treaty]] with the USSR, could not participate.\n\nIt was proposed that the Nordic countries would unify their foreign policy and defence, remain neutral in the event of a conflict and not ally with [[NATO]], which some were planning at the time. The [[United States]], keen on getting access to bases in Scandinavia and believing the Nordic countries incapable of defending themselves, stated it would not ensure military support for Scandinavia if they did not join NATO. As Denmark and Norway sought US aid for their post-war reconstruction, the project collapsed, with Denmark, Norway and Iceland joining NATO.<ref>[http://www.ena.lu/plan_scandinavian_defence_union-2-6834 The plan for a Scandinavian Defence Union], [[European Navigator]]. \u00c9tienne Deschamps. Translated by the CVCE.</ref>\n\nFurther Nordic co-operation, such as an economic customs union, also failed. This led [[Danish Prime Minister]] [[Hans Hedtoft]] to propose, in 1951, a consultative inter-parliamentary body. This proposal was agreed by Denmark, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden in 1952.<ref name=\"H1\">[http://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council/the-nordic-council/the-history-of-the-nordic-council/before-1952 Before 1952], Nordic Council</ref> The Council's first session was held in the Danish Parliament on 13 February 1953 and it elected Hans Hedtoft as its president. When Finnish-Soviet relations thawed following the death of [[Joseph Stalin]], Finland joined the council in 1955.<ref name=\"H2\">[http://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council/the-nordic-council/the-history-of-the-nordic-council/1953-1971 1953\u20131971 Finland joins in and the first Nordic rights are formulated.], Nordic Council</ref>\n\nOn 2 July 1954, the Nordic labour market was created and in 1958, building upon a 1952 passport-free travel area, the [[Nordic Passport Union]] was created. These two measures helped ensure Nordic citizens' free movement around the area. A Nordic Convention on Social Security was implemented in 1955. There were also plans for a [[single market]] but they were abandoned in 1959 shortly before Denmark, Norway, and Sweden joined the [[European Free Trade Area]] (EFTA). Finland became an associated member of EFTA in 1961 and Denmark and Norway applied to join the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC).<ref name=\"H2\"/>\n\nThis move towards the EEC led to desire for a formal Nordic treaty. The Treaty of Helsinki outlined the workings of the Council and came into force on 24 March 1962. Further advancements on Nordic cooperation were made in the following years: a Nordic School of Public Health, a Nordic Cultural Fund, and Nordic House in [[Reykjav\u00edk]] were created. Danish Prime Minister [[Hilmar Baunsgaard]] proposed full economic cooperation (\"[[Nordek]]\") in 1968. Nordek was agreed in 1970, but Finland then backtracked, stating that its ties with the Soviet Union meant it could not form close economic ties with potential members of the EEC (Denmark and Norway).<ref name=\"H2\"/> Nordek was then abandoned.\n\nAs a consequence, Denmark and Norway applied to join the EEC and the Nordic Council of Ministers was set up in 1971 to ensure continued Nordic cooperation.<ref name=\"HM1\">[http://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council-of-ministers/the-nordic-council-of-ministers/history-of-the-nordic-council-of-ministers/the-period-up-to-1971 The period up to 1971] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111120111240/http://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council-of-ministers/the-nordic-council-of-ministers/history-of-the-nordic-council-of-ministers/the-period-up-to-1971 |date=20 November 2011 }}, Nordic Council of Ministers</ref> In 1970 representatives of the [[Faroe Islands]] and [[\u00c5land Islands|\u00c5land]] were allowed to take part in the Nordic Council as part of the Danish and Finnish delegations.<ref name=\"H2\"/> Norway turned down EEC membership in 1972 while Denmark acted as a bridge builder between the EEC and the Nordics.<ref name=\"HM2\">[http://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council-of-ministers/the-nordic-council-of-ministers/history-of-the-nordic-council-of-ministers/197220131989 1972\u20131989] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111120111152/http://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council-of-ministers/the-nordic-council-of-ministers/history-of-the-nordic-council-of-ministers/197220131989 |date=20 November 2011 }}, Nordic Council of Ministers</ref> Also in 1973, although it did not opt for full membership of the EEC, Finland negotiated a free trade treaty with the EEC that in practice removed customs duties from 1977 on, although there were transition periods up to 1985 for some products. Sweden did not apply due to its non-alliance policy, which was aimed at preserving neutrality. Greenland subsequently left the EEC and has since sought a more active role in [[Arctic cooperation and politics|circumpolar]] affairs.\n\nIn the 1970s, the Nordic Council founded the [[Nordic Industrial Fund]], Nordtest and the [[Nordic Investment Bank]]. The Council's remit was also expanded to include environmental protection and, in order to clean up the pollution in the [[Baltic Sea]] and the [[Atlantic Ocean|North Atlantic]], a joint energy network was established. The Nordic Science Policy Council was set up in 1983<ref name=\"HM2\"/> and, in 1984, representatives from Greenland were allowed to join the Danish delegation.<ref name=\"H2\"/>\n\nFollowing the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, the Nordic Council began to cooperate more with the [[Baltic states]] and new Baltic Sea organisations.

With Denmark, Norway, and Iceland being members of NATO and Finland and Sweden being [[Neutrality (international relations)|neutral]], the Nordic Council has not been involved in any military cooperation.\n\n===Council of Ministers===\nThe original Nordic Council concentrates on inter-parliamentary cooperation. [http://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council-of-ministers The ''Nordic Council of Ministers''], founded in 1971, is responsible for inter-governmental cooperation. Prime Ministers have ultimate responsibility but this is usually delegated to the Minister for Nordic Cooperation and the Nordic Committee for Co-operation, which co-ordinates the day-to-day work.

Following the war, the [[Nordic countries]] pursued the idea of a [[Scandinavian defence union]] to ensure their mutual defence. However, Finland, due to its [[Paasikivi\u2013Kekkonen doctrine|Paasikivi-Kekkonen policy of neutrality]] and [[Finno-Soviet Treaty of 1948|FCMA treaty]] with the USSR, could not participate.\n\nIt was proposed that the Nordic countries would unify their foreign policy and defence, remain neutral in the event of a conflict and not ally with [[NATO]], which some were planning at the time. The [[United States]], keen on getting access to bases in Scandinavia and believing the Nordic countries incapable of defending themselves, stated it would not ensure military support for Scandinavia if they did not join NATO. As Denmark and Norway sought US aid for their post-war reconstruction, the project collapsed, with Denmark, Norway and Iceland joining NATO.<ref>[http://www.ena.lu/plan_scandinavian_defence_union-2-6834 The plan for a Scandinavian Defence Union], [[European Navigator]]. \u00c9tienne Deschamps. Translated by the CVCE.</ref>\n\nFurther Nordic co-operation, such as an economic customs union, also failed. This led [[Danish Prime Minister]] [[Hans Hedtoft]] to propose, in 1951, a consultative inter-parliamentary body. This proposal was agreed by Denmark, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden in 1952.<ref name=\"H1\">[http://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council/the-nordic-council/the-history-of-the-nordic-council/before-1952 Before 1952], Nordic Council</ref> The Council's first session was held in the Danish Parliament on 13 February 1953 and it elected Hans Hedtoft as its president.

These two measures helped ensure Nordic citizens' free movement around the area. A Nordic Convention on Social Security was implemented in 1955. There were also plans for a [[single market]] but they were abandoned in 1959 shortly before Denmark, Norway, and Sweden joined the [[European Free Trade Area]] (EFTA). Finland became an associated member of EFTA in 1961 and Denmark and Norway applied to join the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC).<ref name=\"H2\"/>\n\nThis move towards the EEC led to desire for a formal Nordic treaty. The Treaty of Helsinki outlined the workings of the Council and came into force on 24 March 1962. Further advancements on Nordic cooperation were made in the following years: a Nordic School of Public Health, a Nordic Cultural Fund, and Nordic House in [[Reykjav\u00edk]] were created. Danish Prime Minister [[Hilmar Baunsgaard]] proposed full economic cooperation (\"[[Nordek]]\") in 1968. Nordek was agreed in 1970, but Finland then backtracked, stating that its ties with the Soviet Union meant it could not form close economic ties with potential members of the EEC (Denmark and Norway).<ref name=\"H2\"/> Nordek was then abandoned.\n\nAs a consequence, Denmark and Norway applied to join the EEC and the Nordic Council of Ministers was set up in 1971 to ensure continued Nordic cooperation.<ref name=\"HM1\">[http://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council-of-ministers/the-nordic-council-of-ministers/history-of-the-nordic-council-of-ministers/the-period-up-to-1971 The period up to 1971] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111120111240/http://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council-of-ministers/the-nordic-council-of-ministers/history-of-the-nordic-council-of-ministers/the-period-up-to-1971 |date=20 November 2011 }}, Nordic Council of Ministers</ref> In 1970 representatives of the [[Faroe Islands]] and [[\u00c5land Islands|\u00c5land]] were allowed to take part in the Nordic Council as part of the Danish and Finnish delegations.<ref name=\"H2\"/> Norway turned down EEC membership in 1972 while Denmark acted as a bridge builder between the EEC and the Nordics.<ref name=\"HM2\">[http://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council-of-ministers/the-nordic-council-of-ministers/history-of-the-nordic-council-of-ministers/197220131989 1972\u20131989] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111120111152/http://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council-of-ministers/the-nordic-council-of-ministers/history-of-the-nordic-council-of-ministers/197220131989 |date=20 November 2011 }}, Nordic Council of Ministers</ref> Also in 1973, although it did not opt for full membership of the EEC, Finland negotiated a free trade treaty with the EEC that in practice removed customs duties from 1977 on, although there were transition periods up to 1985 for some products. Sweden did not apply due to its non-alliance policy, which was aimed at preserving neutrality. Greenland subsequently left the EEC and has since sought a more active role in [[Arctic cooperation and politics|circumpolar]] affairs.\n\nIn the 1970s, the Nordic Council founded the [[Nordic Industrial Fund]], Nordtest and the [[Nordic Investment Bank]]. The Council's remit was also expanded to include environmental protection and, in order to clean up the pollution in the [[Baltic Sea]] and the [[Atlantic Ocean|North Atlantic]], a joint energy network was established.

The solid [[Saddle#Parts of an equestrian saddle|saddle tree]] was a later invention, and though early [[stirrup]] designs predated the invention of the solid tree. The paired stirrup, which attached to the tree, was the last element of the saddle to reach the basic form that is still used today. Today, modern saddles come in a wide variety of styles, each designed for a specific [[equestrianism]] discipline, and require careful fit to both the rider and the horse. Proper saddle care can extend the useful life of a saddle, often for decades.

It provides a bearing surface to protect the horse from the weight of the rider. The solid saddle tree raises the rider above the horse's back, and distributes the rider's weight, reducing the [[pounds per square inch]] carried on any one part of the horse's back, thus greatly increasing the comfort of the horse and prolonging its useful life.<ref name=\"Bennett (1998)\">Bennett (1998)</ref>{{Page needed|date= October 2018}}\n*'''Seat''': the part of the saddle where the rider sits, it is usually lower than the pommel and cantle to provide security\n*'''{{Anchor|Pommel|pommel}}Pommel''' or '''Pomnel''' (English)/ '''Swells''' (Western): the front, slightly raised area of the saddle.\n*'''{{Anchor|Cantle}}Cantle''': the rear of the saddle\n*'''[[Stirrup]]''': part of the saddle in which the rider's feet are placed; provides support and leverage to the rider. \n*'''{{Anchor|Leathers}}Leathers''' and '''Flaps''' (English), or '''Fenders''' (Western): The leather straps connecting the stirrups to the saddle tree and leather flaps giving support to the rider's leg and protecting the rider from sweat.\n*'''{{Anchor|D-ring}}D-ring''': a \"D\"-shaped ring on the front of a saddle, to which certain pieces of equipment (such as [[breastplate (tack)|breastplates]]) can be attached.\n*'''[[Girth (tack)|Girth]]''' or '''Cinch''':  A wide strap that goes under the horse's barrel, just behind the front legs of the horse that holds the saddle on.\n*'''Panels''', '''Lining''',  or '''Padding''':  Cushioning on the underside of the saddle.\n\nIn addition to the above basic components, some saddles also include:\n*'''[[Surcingle]]''': A long strap that goes all the way around the horse's barrel.

The first stirrup-like object was invented in India in the 2nd century BC, and consisted of a simple leather strap in which the rider's toe was placed. It offered very little support, however. The nomadic tribes in northern China are thought to have been the inventors of the modern stirrup, but the first dependable representation of a rider with paired stirrups was found in China in a [[J\u00ecn Dynasty (265-420)|Jin Dynasty]] tomb of about AD 302.<ref>[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1310/is_1988_Oct/ai_6955868 \"The stirrup - history of Chinese science.\" ''UNESCO Courier, October, 1988]</ref> The stirrup appeared to be in widespread use across China by 477 AD,<ref>Hobson, John M.

This invention gave great support for the rider, and was essential in later [[horses in warfare|warfare]].\n\n===Middle Ages===\n{{Main|Horses in the Middle Ages}}\n[[File:Siodla 17 wiek caly garnitur3.jpg|thumb|right|150px|A saddle commonly seen in the 16th and 17th centuries]]\nSaddles were improved upon during the [[Middle Ages]], as [[knight]]s needed saddles that were stronger and offered more support.  The resulting saddle had a higher ''cantle'' and ''pommel'' (to prevent the rider from being unseated in warfare) and was built on a wooden tree that supported more weight from a rider with armor and weapons. This saddle, a predecessor to the modern [[Western saddle]], was originally padded with wool or horsehair and covered in leather or textiles.  It was later modified for [[cattle]] tending and [[bullfighting]] in addition to the continual development for use in war.  Other saddles, derived from earlier, treeless designs, sometimes added solid trees to support stirrups, but were kept light for use by messengers and for [[horse racing]].\n\n===Development of the modern saddle===\n[[File:1st Viscount Gage.jpg|left|thumb|200px|The English hunting saddle]]\nThe saddle eventually branched off into different designs that became the modern [[English saddle|English]] and [[Western saddle|Western]] saddles.\n\nOne variant of the [[English saddle]] was developed by [[Fran\u00e7ois Robinchon de la Gu\u00e9rini\u00e8re]], a [[France|French]] riding master and author of \"Ecole de Cavalerie\" who made major contributions to what today is known as [[classical dressage]]. He put great emphasis on the proper development of a \"three point\" seat that is still used today by many [[dressage]] riders.\n\nIn the 18th century, [[fox hunting]] became increasingly popular in England. The high-cantle, high-pommel design of earlier saddles became a hindrance, unsafe and uncomfortable for riders as they jumped. Due to this fact, Gu\u00e9rini\u00e8re's saddle design which included a low pommel and cantle and allowed for more freedom of movement for both horse and rider, became increasingly popular throughout northern Europe.  In the early 20th century, Captain [[Frederico Caprilli]] revolutionized the jumping saddle by placing the flap at an angle that allowed a rider to achieve the [[forward seat]] necessary for jumping high fences and traveling rapidly across rugged terrain.\n\nThe modern [[Western saddle]] was developed from the Spanish saddles that were brought by the Spanish [[Conquistadors]] when they came to the [[Americas]]. These saddles were adapted to suit the needs of [[cowboy|vaquero]]s and [[cowboy]]s of Mexico, [[Texas]] and [[California]], including the addition of a horn that allowed a [[Lasso|lariat]] to be tied or dallied for the purpose of holding [[cattle]] and other livestock.\n\n==Types of modern equestrian saddle==\nIn the [[Western world]] there are two basic types of saddles used today for [[equestrianism|horseback riding]], usually called the [[English saddle]] and the \"stock\" saddle. The best known stock saddle is the American [[western saddle]], followed by the [[Australian stock saddle]]. In Asia and throughout the world, there are numerous saddles of unique designs used by various nationalities and ethnic groups.\n\n===English saddle===\n[[File:CollegiateEventer.jpg|thumb|A Hunt Seat style English saddle]]\n{{Main|English saddle}}\n[[English saddle]]s are used for [[English riding]] throughout the world, not just in England or English-speaking countries. They are the saddles used in all of the [[Equestrian at the Summer Olympics|Olympic]] equestrian disciplines. The term English saddle encompasses several different styles of saddle, including those used for [[eventing]], [[show jumping]] and [[hunt seat]], [[dressage]], [[saddle seat]], [[horse racing]], [[horse surfing]] and [[polo]].\n\nTo the casual observer, the major distinguishing feature of an [https://stallion.house/best-english-saddle English saddle] is its flatter appearance, the lack of a horn, and the self-padding design of the ''panels'': a pair of pads attached to the underside of the seat and filled with wool, foam, or air. However, the length and angle of the flaps, the depth of the seat and height of the cantle all play a role in the use for which a particular saddle is intended.\n\nAlthough to the untrained eye all saddles of a similar design look alike, the \"tree\" that underlies the saddle is usually one of the defining features of saddle quality. Traditionally, the tree of an [[English saddle]] is built of laminated layers of high quality wood reinforced with spring steel along its length, with a riveted gullet plate. These trees are semi-adjustable and are considered \"spring trees\". They have some give, but a minimum amount of flexibility.\n\nMore recently, saddle manufacturers are using various materials to replace wood and create a synthetic molded tree (some with the integrated spring steel and gullet plate, some without).  Synthetic materials vary widely in quality. [[Polyurethane]] trees are often very well-made, but some cheap saddles are made with [[fiberglass]] trees of limited durability. Synthetic trees are often lighter, more durable, and easier to customize. Some designs are intended to be more flexible and move with the horse.\n\nSeveral companies offer flexible trees or adjustable gullets that allow the same saddle to be used on different sizes of horses.\n\n===Stock saddles===\n{{Main|Western saddle}}\n{{Main|Australian Stock Saddle}}\n[[File:WesternSaddle2.jpg|thumb|A western saddle]]\n[[Western saddle]]s are saddles originally designed to be used on horses on working [[cattle]] [[ranch]]es in the United States. Used today in a wide variety of [[western riding]] activities, they are the \"cowboy saddles\" familiar to movie viewers, rodeo fans, and those who have gone on tourist trail rides. The Western saddle has no padding of its own, and must be used with a [[saddle blanket]] or pad in order to provide a comfortable fit for the horse. It also has sturdier [[stirrups]] and uses a  [[girth (tack)|cinch]] rather than a [[girth (tack)|girth]]. Its most distinctive feature is the horn on the front of the saddle, originally used to dally a [[Lasso|lariat]] when roping cattle.\n\nOther nations such as Australia and [[Argentina]] have stock saddles that usually do not have a horn, but have other features commonly seen in a western saddle, including a deep seat, high cantle, and heavier leather.\n\nThe tree of a western saddle is the most critical component, defining the size and shape of the finished product.  The tree determines both the width and length of the saddle as it sits on the back of the horse, as well as the length of the seat for the rider, width of the swells (pommel), height of cantle, and, usually, shape of the horn.  Traditional trees were made of wood or wood laminate covered with [[rawhide (textile)|rawhide]] and this style is still manufactured today, though modern synthetic materials are also used. Leather is stretched and molded around the tree, with minimal padding between the tree and the exterior leather, usually a bit of relatively thin padding on the seat, and a sheepskin cover on the underside of the skirts to prevent chafing and rubbing on the horse.\n\nThough a western saddle is often considerably heavier than an English saddle, the tree is designed to spread out the weight of the rider and any equipment the rider may be carrying so that there are fewer pounds per square inch on the horse's back and, when properly fitted, few if any pressure points. Thus, the design, in spite of its weight, can be used for many hours with relatively little discomfort to a properly conditioned horse and rider.\n\n===Military saddles===\n[[File:McCellan Saddle Fort Kearny 2006 C.jpg|thumb|A McClellan [[cavalry]] saddle, used by the United States Army in the late 1800s]]\nBritish Universal Pattern [[military]] saddles were used by the mounted forces from Australia, Britain, Canada, New Zealand and [[South Africa]].<ref>[http://www.lighthorse.org.au/manual/8.html Australian Light Horse Association] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090419160756/http://www.lighthorse.org.au/manual/8.html |date=2009-04-19 }} Retrieved on 26 March 2009</ref>{{better source|date=May 2012}}\n\nThe ''Steel Arch Universal Pattern Mark I'' was issued in 1891. This was found to irritate riders and in 1893 it was discontinued in favour of the ''Mark II''. In 1898, the ''Mark III'' appeared, which had the addition of a V-shaped arrangement of strap billets on the sideboards for the attachment of the girth. This girthing system could be moved forward or back to obtain an optimum fit on a wide range of horses.\n\nFrom 1902 the ''Universal Military Saddle'' was manufactured with a fixed tree, broad panels to spread the load, and initially a front arch in three sizes. The advantage of this saddle was its lightness, ease of repair and comfort for horse and rider. From 1912 the saddle was built on an adjustable tree and consequently only one size was needed. Its advantage over the fixed tree 1902 pattern was its ability to maintain a better fit on the horse's back as the horse gained or lost weight. This saddle was made using traditional methods and featured a seat blocked from sole leather, which maintained its shape well.<ref>[http://www.michaelgraham.com.au/Authentic_Repro/saddle1902.html Universal Pattern 1902 Commonwealth Military Saddle] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090911222350/http://www.michaelgraham.com.au/Authentic_Repro/saddle1902.html |date=2009-09-11 }} Retrieved on 26 March 2009</ref> {{better source|date=May 2012}} Military saddles were fitted with metal staples and dees to carry a [[sword]], spare [[horse shoe]]s and other equipment.\n\nIn the US, the [[McClellan saddle]] was introduced in the 1850s by [[George B. McClellan]] for use by the [[United States Cavalry]], and the core design was used continuously, with some improvements, until the 1940s. Today, the McClellan saddle continues to be used by ceremonial mounted units in the U.S. Army. The basic design that inspired McClellan saw use by military units in several other nations, including [[Rhodesia]] and Mexico, and even to a degree by the British in the [[Second Boer War|Boer War]].\n\nMilitary saddles are still produced and are now used in exhibitions, parades and other events.\n\n===Asian saddle===\n[[File:Kashgarsaddle.JPG|thumb|A Central Asian saddle from [[Kashgar]], China.]]\nSaddles in Asia date to the time of the [[Scythians]] and [[Cimmerians]]. Modern Asian saddles can be divided into two groups: Saddles from [[Central Asia]], which have a prominent horn and leather covering, and saddles from East Asia, which have a high pommel and cantle. Central Asian saddles are noted for their wide seats and high horns. The saddle has a base of wood with a thin leather covering that frequently has a [[lacquer]] finish. Central Asian saddles have no pad and must be ridden with a saddle blanket. The horn comes in particular good use during the rough horseback sport of [[buskashi]], played throughout Central Asia, which involves two teams of riders wrestling over a [[decapitated]] goat's carcass.\n\nSaddles from East Asia differ from Central Asian saddles by their high pommel and cantle and lack of a horn. East Asian saddles can be divided into several types that are associated with certain nationalities and ethnic groups. Saddles used by the [[Han Chinese]] are noted by their use of inlay work for ornamentation. [[Tibet]]an saddles typically employ iron covers inlaid with precious metals on the pommel and cantle and universally come with padding.  Mongolian saddles are similar to the Tibetan style except that they are typically smaller and the seat has a high ridge. Saddles from ethnic minority groups in China's southwest, such as in [[Sichuan]] and [[Yunnan]] provinces, have colorful lacquer work over a leather covering.\n\n====Japanese saddles====\n{{main|Kura (saddle)}}\n[[File:Kura 5.JPG|thumb|Japanese saddle]]\nJapanese saddles are classified as Chinese-style (''karagura'') or Japanese-style (''yamatogura'').  In the [[Nara period]] the Chinese style was adopted. Gradually the Japanese changed the saddle to suit their needs, and in the [[Heian period]], the saddle typically associated with the [[samurai]] class was developed. These saddles, known as [[Kura (Japanese saddle)|''kura'']], were lacquered as protection from the weather. Early samurai warfare was conducted primarily on horseback and the ''kura'' provided a rugged, stable, comfortable platform for shooting arrows, but it was not well suited for speed or distance. In the [[Edo period]] horses were no longer needed for warfare and Japanese saddles became quite elaborate and were decorated with mother of pearl inlays, gold leaf, and designs in colored lacquer.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=eyMYelZlKekC&pg=PA97&dq=kura-bane&hl=en&ei=q0oqTseQK8_1gAeg3LX7Cg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&ved=0CEAQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q&f=true ''Samurai, warfare and the state in early medieval Japan'' (Google eBook), Karl F.

Sidesaddle riding is still seen today in [[horse show]]s, [[fox hunting]], parades and other exhibitions.\n*[[Horse riding stunts|Trick]] (or stunt) riding saddles are similar to western saddles and have a tall metal horn, low front and back, reinforced hand holds and extended double rigging for a wide back girth.\n* [[Endurance riding]] saddle, a saddle designed to be comfortable to the horse with broad panels but lightweight design, as well as comfortable for the rider over long hours of riding over challenging terrain.\n* [[Police horse|Police saddle]], similar to an English saddle in general design, but with a tree that provides greater security to the rider and distributes a rider's weight over a greater area so that the horse is comfortable with a rider on its back for long hours.\n* [[McClellan saddle]], a specific American [[cavalry]] model that entered service just before the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] with the [[United States Army]]. It was designed with an English-type tree, but with a higher pommel and cantle. Also, the area upon which the rider sits was divided into two sections with a gap between the two panels.\n* [[Pack saddle]], similar to a cavalry saddle in the simplicity of its construction, but intended solely for the support of heavy bags or other objects being carried by the horse.\n* [[Double seat saddle]]s have two pairs of stirrups and two deep padded seats for use when double-banking or riding double with a child behind an adult rider.<!--hope that is a proper description of \"double-banking\"--> The western variety has one horn on the front of the saddle.<!--I kind of think these things are dangerous, but I think riding double in general is dangerous...?  Discuss at talk?-->\n* [[Treeless saddle]], available in both Western and English designs, but not built upon a solid saddle tree, intended to be flexible and comfortable on a variety of horses, but also not always able to provide the weight support of a solid tree. The use of an appropriate saddle pad is essential for treeless saddles. (See ''Controversy'' section, ''below'')\n* A [[flexible saddle]] uses a traditional tree, but the panels are not permanently attached to the finished saddle. These saddles use flexible panels (the part that sits along the horse's back) that are moveable and adjustable to provide a custom fit for the horse and allow for changes of placement as the horse's body develops.\n* [[Bareback|Bareback pad]], usually a simple pad in the shape of an English-style saddle pad, made of cordura nylon or leather, padded with fleece, wool or synthetic foam, equipped with a girth. It is used as an alternative to bareback riding to provide padding for both horse and rider and to help keep the rider's clothing a bit cleaner. Depending on materials, bareback pads offer a bit more grip to the rider's seat and legs. However, though some bareback pads come with handles and even stirrups, without being attached to a saddle tree, these appendages are  unsafe and pads with them should be avoided. In some cases, the addition of stirrups without a supporting tree place pressure on the horse's spinous processes, potentially causing damage.\n\n==Fitting==\n{{Main|English saddle|Western saddle}}\n[[File:Auflagefl\u00e4chen.JPG|thumb|Comparison of the undersides of a western saddle (back) and an English saddle (front)]]\nA saddle, regardless of type, must fit both horse and rider.  Saddle fitting is an art and in ideal circumstances is performed by a professional saddlemaker or saddle fitter.  Custom-made saddles designed for an individual horse and rider will fit the best, but are also the most expensive.  However, many manufactured saddles provide a decent fit if properly selected, and some minor adjustments can be made.\n\n===Fitting the horse===\n\nThe debate about the definition of a fitting saddle is still controversial; however, there is a general rule for fitting that no damage should occur to the horse's skin and no injury should be presented to any muscular or neural tissues beneath the saddle.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Von PEINEN|first=K.|last2=Wiestner|first2=T.|last3=Von RECHENBERG|first3=B.|last4=Weishaupt|first4=M. A.|date=2010-11-01|title=Relationship between saddle pressure measurements and clinical signs of saddle soreness at the withers|journal=Equine Veterinary Journal|language=en|volume=42|issue=38|pages=650\u2013653|doi=10.1111/j.2042-3306.2010.00191.x|pmid=21059075|issn=2042-3306|df=}}</ref>\n\nWidth of the saddle is the primary means by which a saddle is measured and fitted to a horse, though length of tree and proper balance must also be considered.  The gullet of a saddle must clear the [[withers]] of the horse, but yet must not be so narrow as to pinch the horse's back.  The tree must be positioned so that the tree points (English) or bars (Western) do not interfere with the movement of the horse's shoulder.  The seat of the saddle must be positioned so that the rider, when riding correctly, is placed over the [[horse's center of balance]]. The bars of the saddle must not be so long that they place pressure beyond the last rib of the horse.  A too-short tree alone does not usually create a problem, as shorter trees are most often on saddles made for children, though a short tree with an unbalanced adult rider may create abnormal pressure points.\n\nWhile a horse's back can be measured for size and shape, the saddle must be tried on the individual animal to assure proper fit.  [[Saddle blanket]]s or pads can provide assistance to correct minor fit problems, but no amount of padding can compensate for a poor-fitting saddle. The common problems associated with saddle fitting problems are: bridging, ill-fitting headplates and incorrect stuffing of the panels.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOne saddle simply cannot fit all animals.  Nor will a saddle fit even the same horse forever without adjustments. As a horse advances in conditioning, age, and training, the back muscles and even the underlying skeletal structures change to some degree.  Thus, particularly with English saddles, a saddle fitter needs to make periodic adjustments. Western saddles are more difficult to adjust, though use of shims and padding can compensate for some changes. A lower pressure per square inch of surface area is a bit more forgiving.  In some cases, a horse will physically develop to a degree that a different saddle may have to be purchased.\n\n===Fitting the rider===\nMethod of fitting riders varies tremendously between designs. Length of the seat is the most common method by which saddles are fitted, though the length and placement of the flaps or fenders of the saddle also influence a person's leg position and thus the way an individual sits.  While a too long or too short seat will cause considerable discomfort, and even interfere with the security of the rider on the horse, width is also a factor.  Any well-fitting saddle should be wide enough to support the rider's seat bones, without being so wide as to cause discomfort.  While saddles are not usually marketed by seat width, designs do vary, and the only way a rider can determine the proper fit of a saddle is to sit on one.\n\nBalance is also a critical factor.  A properly balanced saddle places the rider over the horse's center of balance for the [[equestrianism|equestrian]] discipline involved.  A poor-fitting saddle often leaves a rider feeling that they are sliding backwards and constantly attempting to move \"uphill.\"  Less often, a poor-fitting saddle shifts the rider too far forward and creates a sensation of being pushed onto the horse's neck.\n\n[[Stirrup]] fit varies greatly between disciplines, from the very short stirrup of the [[horse racing]] [[jockey]] to the long stirrup of the [[dressage]] or [[reining]] competitor.  However, in all cases, the stirrup leather must be properly placed so that the rider remains in balance over the saddle and is not thrown ahead or behind the motion of the horse when putting weight in the stirrups.\n\n==Care of a saddle==\nAll saddles need to be kept clean and dry.  They need to be stored under cover, away from weather and dust.  Ideally they should be stored in an area where they are kept at a slightly cool but consistent temperature, though the practical need to keep saddles near horses may make temperature-controlled storage difficult.  Saddles also need to be kept away from a direct heat source, such as a furnace duct or heater, as excess heat, especially driven by a fan, will dry out the leather.  For the same reason, if leather gets wet, it must be allowed to dry naturally, away from a direct heat source.  A properly cared-for saddle can last for many decades, even with regular use.\n\nCleaning is an important part of caring for tack. Tack that is not cleaned will start to build up sweat and dirt, which will cause uncomfortable rubbing on the horse. Sweat and dirt also tend to cause cracking in leather, which may result in breaking. This not only decreases the value of the saddle, but can be very dangerous if critical equipment, such as a stirrup leather, breaks mid-ride. Proper care and conditioning of the saddle will not only increase its useful life, but will also help to retain its value.\n\nA saddle should be cleaned regularly if it used for work. It is usually easiest to clean a saddle when placed on a moveable saddle rack. Ideally, a rider should quickly wipe down the saddle after every ride with a slightly damp, but not wet, sponge or cloth, in order to remove any dirt and sweat. Once a week, or after every 5\u20137 rides, a more thorough cleaning should be performed.\n\nSaddles are cleaned using [[saddle soap]], followed by a conditioning (moisturizing) product that will restore the natural oils back into the leather.  Saddle soap is used with only a minimal amount of water and suds or lather kept low, as getting the leather too wet may lead to a number of problems.  In a dry climate, wet leather may dehydrate and crack, particularly if subjected to repeated wet-dry stresses.  In a humid climate, excess water for cleaning creates an environment for rot and mold.\n\nOnce a saddle is clean, a conditioner is used to restore moisture removed by the cleaning process.  While [[glycerine]]-based saddle soaps have conditioning properties, it is usually important to remove most soap residue before conditioning to prevent product buildup on the leather. Saddles kept in storage also benefit from occasional conditioning to restore natural oils.  While conditioning a saddle is an important element of saddle care, and critical in dry climates, over-oiling may rot jute or other natural fiber stitching, particularly in humid climates.\n[[Neatsfoot oil]] is one traditional conditioner, and products containing [[beeswax]] are popular in some areas, but there are also many other commercial blends of conditioning products available.  Oil products tend to darken leather from its natural color. Sometimes this is desirable and sometimes not, depending on the desired shade of the leather.\n\nStrap parts of the saddle, such as the stirrup leathers, [[billet (tack)|billets]] (on an English saddle) and latigo (on a western saddle) also need conditioning, but it varies by climate.  In a dry climate, failure to oil straps may result in cracking and weakening of the leather, and they can snap or break.  In a more humid climate, too much oil may weaken the leather.  Properly conditioned leather is neither brittle nor floppy in texture and flexibility.\n\nSaddles made of synthetic materials can be cleaned using water and a mild cleaner and do not require conditioning.  They will tolerate being washed with water without risk of drying out or damaging the material.  While synthetics to date will not last as long as a well-cared for leather saddle, they withstand lack of cleaning and care as well as exposure to rain and dampness quite well.\n\nBefore a [[horse show]] or other competition, the rider should take extra care to clean the saddle and polish all metal parts, including the D-rings, stirrups, stirrup bars and nailheads on an English saddle; and the buckles, dees, and ornamental silver on a Western saddle.\n\n==Treeless saddle controversy==\nTreeless and flexible tree saddles in both English and Western styles are becoming popular today, though there are controversies surrounding their use.  Proponents argue that treeless and flex-tree saddles move more easily with a horse's dynamic motion and add shock absorbency between horse and rider.  Treeless saddles are also easier to fit the horse, particularly in the area of the horse's [[scapula]] (shoulder blade).  Opponents of treeless saddles argue that they create abnormal pressure points and over time can cause as many problems as an ill-fitting treed saddle.\n\nFlexible trees may be a compromise between the two camps, but manufacturing quality and design varies greatly. While flexible, adjustable trees are an alternate choice to traditional wooden trees, they carry limitations inherent in both solid tree and treeless designs.\n\nControversy arises in part because, while treeless and flexible tree saddles have benefits for horses with injuries related to poorly-fitted treed saddles, only a solid tree or very well constructed treeless saddle with correct padding can keep the rider off the horse's [[Vertebral column|spine]] and distribute weight evenly across the horse's back without creating localized pressure points.  Pressure should never be put directly on the spinuous processes of the horse nor on the ligament system that runs alongside the spine, and many treeless designs do result in rider-related pressure in this area.  Furthermore, bareback pads, which are often confused with treeless saddles, provide grip but no structural support to protect the horse's spine.  However, a growing number of treeless saddle designs are composed of a system of panels with a wide channel for the spine, thus keeping pressure off the spinuous processes.\n\nSome treeless saddle designs may present problems for riders as well.  Without a supportive tree over the horse's withers, a treeless saddle may place the rider behind the movement of the horse, creating pressure on the horse's [[horse anatomy|loin]] and the rider's low back. Inadequate support may also lead to the rider's seat bones digging into the horse's back.  Additionally, a solid tree supports the curvature of the rider's spine which is essential for communication between horse and rider.<ref>Treeless Saddles. Practical Horseman, Dec. 2008</ref>  On the other hand, many riders with preexisting back or hip problems are more comfortable in a treeless saddle due to the extra padding, adjustability and shock absorption.  Treeless saddles have started to become popular in horse therapy and hippotherapy for this reason.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Equestrianism]]\n*[[Horse tack]]\n*[[Bridle]]\n*[[Domestication of the horse]]\n*[[Stirrup]]\n*[[Horses in warfare]]\n*[[Howdah]]\n\n===Non-animal saddles===\n*[[Motorcycle saddle]]\n*[[Bicycle saddle]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{refbegin|60em}}\n*Bennett, Deb (1998) ''Conquerors: The Roots of New World Horsemanship.''

The solid [[Saddle#Parts of an equestrian saddle|saddle tree]] was a later invention, and though early [[stirrup]] designs predated the invention of the solid tree. The paired stirrup, which attached to the tree, was the last element of the saddle to reach the basic form that is still used today. Today, modern saddles come in a wide variety of styles, each designed for a specific [[equestrianism]] discipline, and require careful fit to both the rider and the horse. Proper saddle care can extend the useful life of a saddle, often for decades.

The saddler eventually covers it with leather or with a leather-like synthetic. The tree's size determines its fit on the horse's back, as well as the size of the seat for the rider. It provides a bearing surface to protect the horse from the weight of the rider. The solid saddle tree raises the rider above the horse's back, and distributes the rider's weight, reducing the [[pounds per square inch]] carried on any one part of the horse's back, thus greatly increasing the comfort of the horse and prolonging its useful life.<ref name=\"Bennett (1998)\">Bennett (1998)</ref>{{Page needed|date= October 2018}}\n*'''Seat''': the part of the saddle where the rider sits, it is usually lower than the pommel and cantle to provide security\n*'''{{Anchor|Pommel|pommel}}Pommel''' or '''Pomnel''' (English)/ '''Swells''' (Western): the front, slightly raised area of the saddle.\n*'''{{Anchor|Cantle}}Cantle''': the rear of the saddle\n*'''[[Stirrup]]''': part of the saddle in which the rider's feet are placed; provides support and leverage to the rider. \n*'''{{Anchor|Leathers}}Leathers''' and '''Flaps''' (English), or '''Fenders''' (Western): The leather straps connecting the stirrups to the saddle tree and leather flaps giving support to the rider's leg and protecting the rider from sweat.\n*'''{{Anchor|D-ring}}D-ring''': a \"D\"-shaped ring on the front of a saddle, to which certain pieces of equipment (such as [[breastplate (tack)|breastplates]]) can be attached.\n*'''[[Girth (tack)|Girth]]''' or '''Cinch''':  A wide strap that goes under the horse's barrel, just behind the front legs of the horse that holds the saddle on.\n*'''Panels''', '''Lining''',  or '''Padding''':  Cushioning on the underside of the saddle.\n\nIn addition to the above basic components, some saddles also include:\n*'''[[Surcingle]]''': A long strap that goes all the way around the horse's barrel.

The first stirrup-like object was invented in India in the 2nd century BC, and consisted of a simple leather strap in which the rider's toe was placed. It offered very little support, however. The nomadic tribes in northern China are thought to have been the inventors of the modern stirrup, but the first dependable representation of a rider with paired stirrups was found in China in a [[J\u00ecn Dynasty (265-420)|Jin Dynasty]] tomb of about AD 302.<ref>[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1310/is_1988_Oct/ai_6955868 \"The stirrup - history of Chinese science.\" ''UNESCO Courier, October, 1988]</ref> The stirrup appeared to be in widespread use across China by 477 AD,<ref>Hobson, John M.

This invention gave great support for the rider, and was essential in later [[horses in warfare|warfare]].\n\n===Middle Ages===\n{{Main|Horses in the Middle Ages}}\n[[File:Siodla 17 wiek caly garnitur3.jpg|thumb|right|150px|A saddle commonly seen in the 16th and 17th centuries]]\nSaddles were improved upon during the [[Middle Ages]], as [[knight]]s needed saddles that were stronger and offered more support.  The resulting saddle had a higher ''cantle'' and ''pommel'' (to prevent the rider from being unseated in warfare) and was built on a wooden tree that supported more weight from a rider with armor and weapons. This saddle, a predecessor to the modern [[Western saddle]], was originally padded with wool or horsehair and covered in leather or textiles.  It was later modified for [[cattle]] tending and [[bullfighting]] in addition to the continual development for use in war.  Other saddles, derived from earlier, treeless designs, sometimes added solid trees to support stirrups, but were kept light for use by messengers and for [[horse racing]].\n\n===Development of the modern saddle===\n[[File:1st Viscount Gage.jpg|left|thumb|200px|The English hunting saddle]]\nThe saddle eventually branched off into different designs that became the modern [[English saddle|English]] and [[Western saddle|Western]] saddles.\n\nOne variant of the [[English saddle]] was developed by [[Fran\u00e7ois Robinchon de la Gu\u00e9rini\u00e8re]], a [[France|French]] riding master and author of \"Ecole de Cavalerie\" who made major contributions to what today is known as [[classical dressage]]. He put great emphasis on the proper development of a \"three point\" seat that is still used today by many [[dressage]] riders.\n\nIn the 18th century, [[fox hunting]] became increasingly popular in England. The high-cantle, high-pommel design of earlier saddles became a hindrance, unsafe and uncomfortable for riders as they jumped. Due to this fact, Gu\u00e9rini\u00e8re's saddle design which included a low pommel and cantle and allowed for more freedom of movement for both horse and rider, became increasingly popular throughout northern Europe.  In the early 20th century, Captain [[Frederico Caprilli]] revolutionized the jumping saddle by placing the flap at an angle that allowed a rider to achieve the [[forward seat]] necessary for jumping high fences and traveling rapidly across rugged terrain.\n\nThe modern [[Western saddle]] was developed from the Spanish saddles that were brought by the Spanish [[Conquistadors]] when they came to the [[Americas]]. These saddles were adapted to suit the needs of [[cowboy|vaquero]]s and [[cowboy]]s of Mexico, [[Texas]] and [[California]], including the addition of a horn that allowed a [[Lasso|lariat]] to be tied or dallied for the purpose of holding [[cattle]] and other livestock.\n\n==Types of modern equestrian saddle==\nIn the [[Western world]] there are two basic types of saddles used today for [[equestrianism|horseback riding]], usually called the [[English saddle]] and the \"stock\" saddle. The best known stock saddle is the American [[western saddle]], followed by the [[Australian stock saddle]]. In Asia and throughout the world, there are numerous saddles of unique designs used by various nationalities and ethnic groups.\n\n===English saddle===\n[[File:CollegiateEventer.jpg|thumb|A Hunt Seat style English saddle]]\n{{Main|English saddle}}\n[[English saddle]]s are used for [[English riding]] throughout the world, not just in England or English-speaking countries. They are the saddles used in all of the [[Equestrian at the Summer Olympics|Olympic]] equestrian disciplines. The term English saddle encompasses several different styles of saddle, including those used for [[eventing]], [[show jumping]] and [[hunt seat]], [[dressage]], [[saddle seat]], [[horse racing]], [[horse surfing]] and [[polo]].\n\nTo the casual observer, the major distinguishing feature of an English saddle is its flatter appearance, the lack of a horn, and the self-padding design of the ''panels'': a pair of pads attached to the underside of the seat and filled with wool, foam, or air. However, the length and angle of the flaps, the depth of the seat and height of the cantle all play a role in the use for which a particular saddle is intended.\n\nAlthough to the untrained eye all saddles of a similar design look alike, the \"tree\" that underlies the saddle is usually one of the defining features of saddle quality. Traditionally, the tree of an [[English saddle]] is built of laminated layers of high quality wood reinforced with spring steel along its length, with a riveted gullet plate. These trees are semi-adjustable and are considered \"spring trees\". They have some give, but a minimum amount of flexibility.\n\nMore recently, saddle manufacturers are using various materials to replace wood and create a synthetic molded tree (some with the integrated spring steel and gullet plate, some without).  Synthetic materials vary widely in quality. [[Polyurethane]] trees are often very well-made, but some cheap saddles are made with [[fiberglass]] trees of limited durability. Synthetic trees are often lighter, more durable, and easier to customize. Some designs are intended to be more flexible and move with the horse.\n\nSeveral companies offer flexible trees or adjustable gullets that allow the same saddle to be used on different sizes of horses.\n\n===Stock saddles===\n{{Main|Western saddle}}\n{{Main|Australian Stock Saddle}}\n[[File:WesternSaddle2.jpg|thumb|A western saddle]]\n[[Western saddle]]s are saddles originally designed to be used on horses on working [[cattle]] [[ranch]]es in the United States. Used today in a wide variety of [[western riding]] activities, they are the \"cowboy saddles\" familiar to movie viewers, rodeo fans, and those who have gone on tourist trail rides. The Western saddle has no padding of its own, and must be used with a [[saddle blanket]] or pad in order to provide a comfortable fit for the horse. It also has sturdier [[stirrups]] and uses a  [[girth (tack)|cinch]] rather than a [[girth (tack)|girth]]. Its most distinctive feature is the horn on the front of the saddle, originally used to dally a [[Lasso|lariat]] when roping cattle.\n\nOther nations such as Australia and [[Argentina]] have stock saddles that usually do not have a horn, but have other features commonly seen in a western saddle, including a deep seat, high cantle, and heavier leather.\n\nThe tree of a western saddle is the most critical component, defining the size and shape of the finished product.  The tree determines both the width and length of the saddle as it sits on the back of the horse, as well as the length of the seat for the rider, width of the swells (pommel), height of cantle, and, usually, shape of the horn.  Traditional trees were made of wood or wood laminate covered with [[rawhide (textile)|rawhide]] and this style is still manufactured today, though modern synthetic materials are also used. Leather is stretched and molded around the tree, with minimal padding between the tree and the exterior leather, usually a bit of relatively thin padding on the seat, and a sheepskin cover on the underside of the skirts to prevent chafing and rubbing on the horse.\n\nThough a western saddle is often considerably heavier than an English saddle, the tree is designed to spread out the weight of the rider and any equipment the rider may be carrying so that there are fewer pounds per square inch on the horse's back and, when properly fitted, few if any pressure points. Thus, the design, in spite of its weight, can be used for many hours with relatively little discomfort to a properly conditioned horse and rider.\n\n===Military saddles===\n[[File:McCellan Saddle Fort Kearny 2006 C.jpg|thumb|A McClellan [[cavalry]] saddle, used by the United States Army in the late 1800s]]\nBritish Universal Pattern [[military]] saddles were used by the mounted forces from Australia, Britain, Canada, New Zealand and [[South Africa]].<ref>[http://www.lighthorse.org.au/manual/8.html Australian Light Horse Association] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090419160756/http://www.lighthorse.org.au/manual/8.html |date=2009-04-19 }} Retrieved on 26 March 2009</ref>{{better source|date=May 2012}}\n\nThe ''Steel Arch Universal Pattern Mark I'' was issued in 1891. This was found to irritate riders and in 1893 it was discontinued in favour of the ''Mark II''. In 1898, the ''Mark III'' appeared, which had the addition of a V-shaped arrangement of strap billets on the sideboards for the attachment of the girth. This girthing system could be moved forward or back to obtain an optimum fit on a wide range of horses.\n\nFrom 1902 the ''Universal Military Saddle'' was manufactured with a fixed tree, broad panels to spread the load, and initially a front arch in three sizes. The advantage of this saddle was its lightness, ease of repair and comfort for horse and rider. From 1912 the saddle was built on an adjustable tree and consequently only one size was needed. Its advantage over the fixed tree 1902 pattern was its ability to maintain a better fit on the horse's back as the horse gained or lost weight. This saddle was made using traditional methods and featured a seat blocked from sole leather, which maintained its shape well.<ref>[http://www.michaelgraham.com.au/Authentic_Repro/saddle1902.html Universal Pattern 1902 Commonwealth Military Saddle] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090911222350/http://www.michaelgraham.com.au/Authentic_Repro/saddle1902.html |date=2009-09-11 }} Retrieved on 26 March 2009</ref> {{better source|date=May 2012}} Military saddles were fitted with metal staples and dees to carry a [[sword]], spare [[horse shoe]]s and other equipment.\n\nIn the US, the [[McClellan saddle]] was introduced in the 1850s by [[George B. McClellan]] for use by the [[United States Cavalry]], and the core design was used continuously, with some improvements, until the 1940s. Today, the McClellan saddle continues to be used by ceremonial mounted units in the U.S. Army. The basic design that inspired McClellan saw use by military units in several other nations, including [[Rhodesia]] and Mexico, and even to a degree by the British in the [[Second Boer War|Boer War]].\n\nMilitary saddles are still produced and are now used in exhibitions, parades and other events.\n\n===Asian saddle===\n[[File:Kashgarsaddle.JPG|thumb|A Central Asian saddle from [[Kashgar]], China.]]\nSaddles in Asia date to the time of the [[Scythians]] and [[Cimmerians]]. Modern Asian saddles can be divided into two groups: Saddles from [[Central Asia]], which have a prominent horn and leather covering, and saddles from East Asia, which have a high pommel and cantle. Central Asian saddles are noted for their wide seats and high horns. The saddle has a base of wood with a thin leather covering that frequently has a [[lacquer]] finish. Central Asian saddles have no pad and must be ridden with a saddle blanket. The horn comes in particular good use during the rough horseback sport of [[buskashi]], played throughout Central Asia, which involves two teams of riders wrestling over a [[decapitated]] goat's carcass.\n\nSaddles from East Asia differ from Central Asian saddles by their high pommel and cantle and lack of a horn. East Asian saddles can be divided into several types that are associated with certain nationalities and ethnic groups. Saddles used by the [[Han Chinese]] are noted by their use of inlay work for ornamentation. [[Tibet]]an saddles typically employ iron covers inlaid with precious metals on the pommel and cantle and universally come with padding.  Mongolian saddles are similar to the Tibetan style except that they are typically smaller and the seat has a high ridge. Saddles from ethnic minority groups in China's southwest, such as in [[Sichuan]] and [[Yunnan]] provinces, have colorful lacquer work over a leather covering.\n\n====Japanese saddles====\n{{main|Kura (saddle)}}\n[[File:Kura 5.JPG|thumb|Japanese saddle]]\nJapanese saddles are classified as Chinese-style (''karagura'') or Japanese-style (''yamatogura'').  In the [[Nara period]] the Chinese style was adopted. Gradually the Japanese changed the saddle to suit their needs, and in the [[Heian period]], the saddle typically associated with the [[samurai]] class was developed. These saddles, known as [[Kura (Japanese saddle)|''kura'']], were lacquered as protection from the weather. Early samurai warfare was conducted primarily on horseback and the ''kura'' provided a rugged, stable, comfortable platform for shooting arrows, but it was not well suited for speed or distance. In the [[Edo period]] horses were no longer needed for warfare and Japanese saddles became quite elaborate and were decorated with mother of pearl inlays, gold leaf, and designs in colored lacquer.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=eyMYelZlKekC&pg=PA97&dq=kura-bane&hl=en&ei=q0oqTseQK8_1gAeg3LX7Cg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&ved=0CEAQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q&f=true ''Samurai, warfare and the state in early medieval Japan'' (Google eBook), Karl F.

Sidesaddle riding is still seen today in [[horse show]]s, [[fox hunting]], parades and other exhibitions.\n*[[Horse riding stunts|Trick]] (or stunt) riding saddles are similar to western saddles and have a tall metal horn, low front and back, reinforced hand holds and extended double rigging for a wide back girth.\n* [[Endurance riding]] saddle, a saddle designed to be comfortable to the horse with broad panels but lightweight design, as well as comfortable for the rider over long hours of riding over challenging terrain.\n* [[Police horse|Police saddle]], similar to an English saddle in general design, but with a tree that provides greater security to the rider and distributes a rider's weight over a greater area so that the horse is comfortable with a rider on its back for long hours.\n* [[McClellan saddle]], a specific American [[cavalry]] model that entered service just before the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] with the [[United States Army]]. It was designed with an English-type tree, but with a higher pommel and cantle.

Discuss at talk?-->\n* [[Treeless saddle]], available in both Western and English designs, but not built upon a solid saddle tree, intended to be flexible and comfortable on a variety of horses, but also not always able to provide the weight support of a solid tree. The use of an appropriate saddle pad is essential for treeless saddles. (See ''Controversy'' section, ''below'')\n* A [[flexible saddle]] uses a traditional tree, but the panels are not permanently attached to the finished saddle. These saddles use flexible panels (the part that sits along the horse's back) that are moveable and adjustable to provide a custom fit for the horse and allow for changes of placement as the horse's body develops.\n* [[Bareback|Bareback pad]], usually a simple pad in the shape of an English-style saddle pad, made of cordura nylon or leather, padded with fleece, wool or synthetic foam, equipped with a girth. It is used as an alternative to bareback riding to provide padding for both horse and rider and to help keep the rider's clothing a bit cleaner. Depending on materials, bareback pads offer a bit more grip to the rider's seat and legs. However, though some bareback pads come with handles and even stirrups, without being attached to a saddle tree, these appendages are  unsafe and pads with them should be avoided. In some cases, the addition of stirrups without a supporting tree place pressure on the horse's spinous processes, potentially causing damage.\n\n==Fitting==\n{{Main|English saddle|Western saddle}}\n[[File:Auflagefl\u00e4chen.JPG|thumb|Comparison of the undersides of a western saddle (back) and an English saddle (front)]]\nA saddle, regardless of type, must fit both horse and rider.  Saddle fitting is an art and in ideal circumstances is performed by a professional saddlemaker or saddle fitter.  Custom-made saddles designed for an individual horse and rider will fit the best, but are also the most expensive.  However, many manufactured saddles provide a decent fit if properly selected, and some minor adjustments can be made.\n\n===Fitting the horse===\n\nThe debate about the definition of a fitting saddle is still controversial; however, there is a general rule for fitting that no damage should occur to the horse's skin and no injury should be presented to any muscular or neural tissues beneath the saddle.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Von PEINEN|first=K.|last2=Wiestner|first2=T.|last3=Von RECHENBERG|first3=B.|last4=Weishaupt|first4=M.

The gullet of a saddle must clear the [[withers]] of the horse, but yet must not be so narrow as to pinch the horse's back.  The tree must be positioned so that the tree points (English) or bars (Western) do not interfere with the movement of the horse's shoulder.  The seat of the saddle must be positioned so that the rider, when riding correctly, is placed over the [[horse's center of balance]]. The bars of the saddle must not be so long that they place pressure beyond the last rib of the horse.  A too-short tree alone does not usually create a problem, as shorter trees are most often on saddles made for children, though a short tree with an unbalanced adult rider may create abnormal pressure points.\n\nWhile a horse's back can be measured for size and shape, the saddle must be tried on the individual animal to assure proper fit.  [[Saddle blanket]]s or pads can provide assistance to correct minor fit problems, but no amount of padding can compensate for a poor-fitting saddle. The common problems associated with saddle fitting problems are: bridging, ill-fitting headplates and incorrect stuffing of the panels.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOne saddle simply cannot fit all animals.  Nor will a saddle fit even the same horse forever without adjustments. As a horse advances in conditioning, age, and training, the back muscles and even the underlying skeletal structures change to some degree.  Thus, particularly with English saddles, a saddle fitter needs to make periodic adjustments. Western saddles are more difficult to adjust, though use of shims and padding can compensate for some changes. A lower pressure per square inch of surface area is a bit more forgiving.  In some cases, a horse will physically develop to a degree that a different saddle may have to be purchased.\n\n===Fitting the rider===\nMethod of fitting riders varies tremendously between designs. Length of the seat is the most common method by which saddles are fitted, though the length and placement of the flaps or fenders of the saddle also influence a person's leg position and thus the way an individual sits.  While a too long or too short seat will cause considerable discomfort, and even interfere with the security of the rider on the horse, width is also a factor.  Any well-fitting saddle should be wide enough to support the rider's seat bones, without being so wide as to cause discomfort.  While saddles are not usually marketed by seat width, designs do vary, and the only way a rider can determine the proper fit of a saddle is to sit on one.\n\nBalance is also a critical factor.  A properly balanced saddle places the rider over the horse's center of balance for the [[equestrianism|equestrian]] discipline involved.  A poor-fitting saddle often leaves a rider feeling that they are sliding backwards and constantly attempting to move \"uphill.\"  Less often, a poor-fitting saddle shifts the rider too far forward and creates a sensation of being pushed onto the horse's neck.\n\n[[Stirrup]] fit varies greatly between disciplines, from the very short stirrup of the [[horse racing]] [[jockey]] to the long stirrup of the [[dressage]] or [[reining]] competitor.  However, in all cases, the stirrup leather must be properly placed so that the rider remains in balance over the saddle and is not thrown ahead or behind the motion of the horse when putting weight in the stirrups.\n\n==Care of a saddle==\nAll saddles need to be kept clean and dry.  They need to be stored under cover, away from weather and dust.  Ideally they should be stored in an area where they are kept at a slightly cool but consistent temperature, though the practical need to keep saddles near horses may make temperature-controlled storage difficult.  Saddles also need to be kept away from a direct heat source, such as a furnace duct or heater, as excess heat, especially driven by a fan, will dry out the leather.  For the same reason, if leather gets wet, it must be allowed to dry naturally, away from a direct heat source.  A properly cared-for saddle can last for many decades, even with regular use.\n\nCleaning is an important part of caring for tack. Tack that is not cleaned will start to build up sweat and dirt, which will cause uncomfortable rubbing on the horse. Sweat and dirt also tend to cause cracking in leather, which may result in breaking. This not only decreases the value of the saddle, but can be very dangerous if critical equipment, such as a stirrup leather, breaks mid-ride. Proper care and conditioning of the saddle will not only increase its useful life, but will also help to retain its value.\n\nA saddle should be cleaned regularly if it used for work. It is usually easiest to clean a saddle when placed on a moveable saddle rack. Ideally, a rider should quickly wipe down the saddle after every ride with a slightly damp, but not wet, sponge or cloth, in order to remove any dirt and sweat. Once a week, or after every 5\u20137 rides, a more thorough cleaning should be performed.\n\nSaddles are cleaned using [[saddle soap]], followed by a conditioning (moisturizing) product that will restore the natural oils back into the leather.  Saddle soap is used with only a minimal amount of water and suds or lather kept low, as getting the leather too wet may lead to a number of problems.  In a dry climate, wet leather may dehydrate and crack, particularly if subjected to repeated wet-dry stresses.  In a humid climate, excess water for cleaning creates an environment for rot and mold.\n\nOnce a saddle is clean, a conditioner is used to restore moisture removed by the cleaning process.  While [[glycerine]]-based saddle soaps have conditioning properties, it is usually important to remove most soap residue before conditioning to prevent product buildup on the leather. Saddles kept in storage also benefit from occasional conditioning to restore natural oils.  While conditioning a saddle is an important element of saddle care, and critical in dry climates, over-oiling may rot jute or other natural fiber stitching, particularly in humid climates.\n[[Neatsfoot oil]] is one traditional conditioner, and products containing [[beeswax]] are popular in some areas, but there are also many other commercial blends of conditioning products available.  Oil products tend to darken leather from its natural color. Sometimes this is desirable and sometimes not, depending on the desired shade of the leather.\n\nStrap parts of the saddle, such as the stirrup leathers, [[billet (tack)|billets]] (on an English saddle) and latigo (on a western saddle) also need conditioning, but it varies by climate.  In a dry climate, failure to oil straps may result in cracking and weakening of the leather, and they can snap or break.  In a more humid climate, too much oil may weaken the leather.  Properly conditioned leather is neither brittle nor floppy in texture and flexibility.\n\nSaddles made of synthetic materials can be cleaned using water and a mild cleaner and do not require conditioning.  They will tolerate being washed with water without risk of drying out or damaging the material.  While synthetics to date will not last as long as a well-cared for leather saddle, they withstand lack of cleaning and care as well as exposure to rain and dampness quite well.\n\nBefore a [[horse show]] or other competition, the rider should take extra care to clean the saddle and polish all metal parts, including the D-rings, stirrups, stirrup bars and nailheads on an English saddle; and the buckles, dees, and ornamental silver on a Western saddle.\n\n==Treeless saddle controversy==\nTreeless and flexible tree saddles in both English and Western styles are becoming popular today, though there are controversies surrounding their use.  Proponents argue that treeless and flex-tree saddles move more easily with a horse's dynamic motion and add shock absorbency between horse and rider.  Treeless saddles are also easier to fit the horse, particularly in the area of the horse's [[scapula]] (shoulder blade).  Opponents of treeless saddles argue that they create abnormal pressure points and over time can cause as many problems as an ill-fitting treed saddle.\n\nFlexible trees may be a compromise between the two camps, but manufacturing quality and design varies greatly. While flexible, adjustable trees are an alternate choice to traditional wooden trees, they carry limitations inherent in both solid tree and treeless designs.\n\nControversy arises in part because, while treeless and flexible tree saddles have benefits for horses with injuries related to poorly-fitted treed saddles, only a solid tree or very well constructed treeless saddle with correct padding can keep the rider off the horse's [[Vertebral column|spine]] and distribute weight evenly across the horse's back without creating localized pressure points.  Pressure should never be put directly on the spinuous processes of the horse nor on the ligament system that runs alongside the spine, and many treeless designs do result in rider-related pressure in this area.  Furthermore, bareback pads, which are often confused with treeless saddles, provide grip but no structural support to protect the horse's spine.  However, a growing number of treeless saddle designs are composed of a system of panels with a wide channel for the spine, thus keeping pressure off the spinuous processes.\n\nSome treeless saddle designs may present problems for riders as well.  Without a supportive tree over the horse's withers, a treeless saddle may place the rider behind the movement of the horse, creating pressure on the horse's [[horse anatomy|loin]] and the rider's low back. Inadequate support may also lead to the rider's seat bones digging into the horse's back.  Additionally, a solid tree supports the curvature of the rider's spine which is essential for communication between horse and rider.<ref>Treeless Saddles. Practical Horseman, Dec. 2008</ref>  On the other hand, many riders with preexisting back or hip problems are more comfortable in a treeless saddle due to the extra padding, adjustability and shock absorption.  Treeless saddles have started to become popular in horse therapy and hippotherapy for this reason.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Equestrianism]]\n*[[Horse tack]]\n*[[Bridle]]\n*[[Domestication of the horse]]\n*[[Stirrup]]\n*[[Horses in warfare]]\n*[[Howdah]]\n\n===Non-animal saddles===\n*[[Motorcycle saddle]]\n*[[Bicycle saddle]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{refbegin|60em}}\n*Bennett, Deb (1998) ''Conquerors: The Roots of New World Horsemanship.''

It was the 21st&nbsp;[[FIFA World Cup]], a worldwide football tournament held once every four years. It was the 11th&nbsp;time the championships had been held in Europe, and the first time they were held in [[Eastern Europe]]. At an estimated cost of over $14.2&nbsp;billion, it was the most expensive World Cup to date.\n\nThe finals involved 32 teams, of which 31 came through [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification|qualifying competitions]], while as the host nation [[Russia national football team|Russia]] qualified automatically. Of the 32, 20 had also appeared in the [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014 event]], while both [[Iceland national football team|Iceland]] and [[Panama national football team|Panama]] made their first appearances at the World Cup. 64 matches were played in 12 venues across 11 cities. [[Germany national football team|Germany]], the defending champions, were eliminated in the group stage. Host nation Russia was eliminated in the quarter-finals. In the [[2018 FIFA World Cup Final|final]], [[France national football team|France]] played [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]] on 15&nbsp;July at the [[Luzhniki Stadium]] in [[Moscow]]. France won the match 4\u20132 to claim their second World Cup.\n\nThe event featured a number of accolades. Croatian player [[Luka Modri\u0107]] was voted the tournament's best player winning the Golden Ball. England's [[Harry Kane]] scored the most goals during the tournament with six. [[Thibaut Courtois]] won the Golden Glove awarded to the [[goalkeeper]] with the most [[clean sheet]]s. The event was praised for the quality of football but criticised for being a distraction from [[Doping in Russia|doping allegations]] and public relations within Russia. It has been estimated that more than three million people attended games during the tournament.\n\n==Host selection==\n{{Main|Russia 2018 FIFA World Cup bid}}\n[[File:Russia 2018 World Cup.jpeg|thumb|Russian bid personnel celebrate the awarding of the 2018 World Cup to Russia on 2 December 2010.]]\n[[File:Vladimir Putin FIFA World Cup Trophy Tour kick-off ceremony.jpg|thumb|President [[Vladimir Putin]] holding the [[FIFA World Cup Trophy]] at a pre-tournament ceremony in Moscow on 9&nbsp;September 2017]]\n[[File:Russia 100 Rubles 2018 FIFA World Cup.jpg|thumb|upright|The 100-[[Russian ruble|ruble]] commemorative banknote celebrates the 2018 FIFA World Cup.

Russia has come across as friendly and hospitable: a stark contrast with the country's authoritarian image. All the foreign fans I have spoken to are pleasantly surprised.\"<ref name=\"91I71\" />\n\nFIFA president [[Gianni Infantino]] stated: \"Everyone discovered a beautiful country, a welcoming country, that is keen to show the world that everything that has been said before might not be true.

After having tested the technology at limited matches of the [[2013 FIFA Confederations Cup]],<ref name=\"wPguj\" /> and the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] (via private tests and public viewings in the host city of [[Rio de Janeiro]]),<ref name=\"kVsNi\" /> the 2018 World Cup was the first World Cup in which all matches were produced in [[4K resolution|4K]] [[Ultra-high-definition television|ultra high definition]]. Host Broadcast Services (HBS) stated that at least 75% of the broadcast cut on each match would come from 4K cameras (covering the majority of main angles), with instant replays and some camera angles being upconverted from [[1080p]] high definition sources with limited degradation in quality. These broadcasts were made available from selected rightsholders and television providers.<ref name=\"TCu23\" /><ref name=\"0j6eE\" /><ref name=\"6j06c\" />\n\nIn February 2018, Ukrainian rightsholder [[UA:PBC]] stated that it would not broadcast the World Cup. This came in the wake of growing boycotts of the tournament among the [[Football Federation of Ukraine]] and sports minister [[Ihor Zhdanov]].<ref name=\"Xv82A\" /><ref name=\"0gvp3\" /> Additionally, the Football Federation of Ukraine refused to accredit journalists for the World Cup and waived their quota of tickets.<ref name=\"MLa57\" /> However, the Ukrainian state TV still broadcast the World Cup, and more than 4 million Ukrainians watched the opening match.<ref name=\"YqvyD\" />\n\nBroadcast rights to the tournament in the Middle East were hampered by an ongoing [[2017\u201318 Qatar diplomatic crisis|diplomatic crisis in Qatar]], which saw Bahrain, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates cut diplomatic ties with Qatar\u2014the home country of FIFA's Middle East and Africa rightsholder [[beIN Sports]]\u2014in June 2017, over its [[Qatar and state-sponsored terrorism|alleged state support of terrorist groups]]. On 2 June 2018, beIN pulled its channels from [[Du (company)|Du]] and [[Etisalat]], but with service to the latter restored later that day. Etisalat subsequently announced that it would air the World Cup in the UAE, and continue to offer beIN normally and without interruptions.<ref name=\"y5Kr4\" /><ref name=\"mvmPW\" /><ref name=\"jyl42\" /> In Saudi Arabia, beIN was banned from doing business; as a result, its channels and other content have been widely and illegally repackaged by a broadcaster identifying itself as \"[[beoutQ]]\". While FIFA attempted to indirectly negotiate the sale of a package consisting of Saudi matches and the final, they were unable to do so. On 12 July 2018, FIFA stated that it had \"engaged counsel to take legal action in Saudi Arabia and is working alongside other sports rights owners that have also been affected to protect its interests.\"<ref name=\"NIzbW\" /><ref name=\"6N9LV\" />\n\nIn the United States, the 2018 World Cup was the first men's World Cup whose English rights were held by [[Fox Sports (United States)|Fox Sports]], and Spanish rights held by [[Telemundo Deportes|Telemundo]]. The elimination of the United States in qualifying led to concerns that US interest and viewership of this World Cup would be reduced, noting that \"casual\" viewers of U.S. matches caused them to peak at 16.5&nbsp;million viewers in 2014, and how much Fox paid for the rights. During a launch event prior to the elimination, Fox stated that it had planned to place a secondary focus on the Mexican team in its coverage to take advantage of their popularity among [[Hispanic and Latino Americans]]. Fox stated that it was still committed to broadcasting a significant amount of coverage for the tournament.<ref name=\"lJrJH\" /><ref name=\"Oo1hn\" /><ref name=\"1M4WS\" /> Viewership was down overall over 2014, additionally citing match scheduling that was not as favourable to viewers in the Americas than 2014 (with many matches airing in the morning hours, although Telemundo's broadcast of the Mexico-Sweden Group F match was announced as being its most-watched weekday [[Daytime television|daytime]] program in network history).<ref name=\"wx1ZL\" /><ref name=\"UFMpG\" />\n\nUnlike previous tournaments, where the rights were bundled with those of South Korea, [[Korean Central Television]] acquired rights to the 2018 World Cup within North Korea. Broadcasts only began with the round of 16, and matches were tape delayed and edited for time. In addition, matches involving Japan were excluded from the broadcasts, due to [[Japan\u2013North Korea relations|strained relations and campaigns against the country]].<ref name=\"iscoP\"

football|football]] tournament contested by [[List of men's national association football teams|men's national teams]] and took place between 14&nbsp;June and 15&nbsp;July 2018 in Russia. It was the 21st&nbsp;[[FIFA World Cup]], a worldwide football tournament held once every four years. It was the 11th&nbsp;time the championships had been held in Europe, and the first time they were held in [[Eastern Europe]]. At an estimated cost of over $14.2&nbsp;billion, it was the most expensive World Cup to date.\n\nThe finals involved 32 teams, of which 31 came through [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification|qualifying competitions]], while as the host nation [[Russia national football team|Russia]] qualified automatically. Of the 32, 20 had also appeared in the [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014 event]], while both [[Iceland national football team|Iceland]] and [[Panama national football team|Panama]] made their first appearances at the World Cup. 64 matches were played in 12 venues across 11 cities. [[Germany national football team|Germany]], the defending champions, were eliminated in the group stage. Host nation Russia was eliminated in the quarter-finals. In the [[2018 FIFA World Cup Final|final]], [[France national football team|France]] played [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]] on 15&nbsp;July at the [[Luzhniki Stadium]] in [[Moscow]]. France won the match 4\u20132 to claim their second World Cup.\n\nThe event featured a number of accolades. Croatian player [[Luka Modri\u0107]] was voted the tournament's best player winning the Golden Ball. England's [[Harry Kane]] scored the most goals during the tournament with six. [[Thibaut Courtois]] won the Golden Glove awarded to the [[goalkeeper]] with the most [[clean sheet]]s. The event was praised for the quality of football but criticised for being a distraction from [[Doping in Russia|doping allegations]] and public relations within Russia. It has been estimated that more than three million people attended games during the tournament.\n\n==Host selection==\n{{Main|Russia 2018 FIFA World Cup bid}}\n[[File:Russia 2018 World Cup.jpeg|thumb|Russian bid personnel celebrate the awarding of the 2018 World Cup to Russia on 2 December 2010.]]\n[[File:Vladimir Putin FIFA World Cup Trophy Tour kick-off ceremony.jpg|thumb|President [[Vladimir Putin]] holding the [[FIFA World Cup Trophy]] at a pre-tournament ceremony in Moscow on 9&nbsp;September 2017]]\n[[File:Russia 100 Rubles 2018 FIFA World Cup.jpg|thumb|upright|The 100-[[Russian ruble|ruble]] commemorative banknote celebrates the 2018 FIFA World Cup.

As such, there were eventually four bids for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, two of which were joint bids: England, Russia, Netherlands/Belgium, and Portugal/Spain.<ref name=\"xBccj\" />\n\nThe 22-member [[FIFA Council|FIFA Executive Committee]] convened in [[Z\u00fcrich]] on 2&nbsp;December 2010 to vote to select the hosts of both tournaments.<ref name=\"WFQKr\" /> Russia won the right to be the 2018 host in the second round of voting. The Portugal/Spain bid came second, and that from Belgium/Netherlands third. England, which was bidding to host its second tournament, was eliminated in the first round.<ref name=\"kKxiB\" />\n\nThe voting results were:<ref name=\"xBccj\" />\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+2018 FIFA bidding (majority 12 votes)\n!rowspan=2|Bidders\n!colspan=2|Votes\n|-\n!Round 1\n!Round 2\n|-\n|'''Russia'''\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|9\n|{{yes|13}}\n|-\n|Portugal / Spain\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|7\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|7\n|-\n|Belgium / Netherlands\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|4\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|2\n|-\n|England\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|2\n|{{no result|Eliminated}}\n|}\n\n===Host selection criticism===\nThe choice of Russia as host has been challenged. Controversial issues included the level of racism in Russian football,<ref name=\"emKvG\" /><ref name=\"LlUcj\" /><ref name=\"hjJfX\" /> human rights abuses by the Russian government,<ref name=\"hkImm\" /> and discrimination against [[LGBT]] people in wider Russian society.<ref name=\"qKYJ4\" /><ref name=\"rMyFt\" /> Russia's involvement in the [[War in Donbass|ongoing conflict in Ukraine]] had also prompted calls for the tournament to be moved, particularly following the [[annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|annexation of Crimea]].<ref name=\"eGuva\" /><ref name=\"tQHRS\" /> In 2014, FIFA president Sepp Blatter stated that \"the World Cup has been given and voted to Russia and we are going forward with our work\".<ref name=\"UeAW8\" />\n\nAllegations of [[corruption]] in the bidding processes and concerns over bribery on the part of the Russian team and corruption by FIFA members for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups led to threats from England's [[The Football Association|FA]] to boycott the tournament.<ref name=\"mZGjr\" /> They claimed that four members of the executive committee had requested bribes to vote for England, and [[Sepp Blatter]] had said it had already been arranged before the vote that Russia would win.<ref name=\"sRBCC\" /> FIFA appointed [[Michael J. Garcia]], a US attorney, to investigate and produce [[Garcia Report|a report]] on the corruption allegations. Although the report was never published, FIFA released a 42-page summary of its findings as determined by German judge [[Hans-Joachim Eckert]]. Eckert's summary cleared Russia and Qatar of any wrongdoing, but was denounced by critics as a whitewash.<ref name=\"APfire\" /> Because of the controversy, the FA refused to accept Eckert's absolving Russia from blame. [[Greg Dyke]] called for a re-examination of the affair and [[David Bernstein (executive)|David Bernstein]] called for a boycott of the World Cup.<ref name=\"zt9ZM\" /><ref name=\"2xMiJ\" />Garcia criticised the summary as being \"materially incomplete\" with \"erroneous representations of the facts and conclusions\", and appealed to FIFA's Appeal Committee.<ref name=\"K7Ghy\" /><ref name=\"WhatNow\" /> The committee declined to hear his appeal, so Garcia resigned to protest of FIFA's conduct, citing a \"lack of leadership\" and lack of confidence in Eckert's independence of Eckert.<ref name=\"0U57X\" />\n\nOn 3 June 2015, the [[FBI]] confirmed that federal authorities were investigating the bidding and awarding processes for the 2018 and [[2022 FIFA World Cup|2022 World Cups]].<ref name=\"r8Bz2\" /><ref name=\"lgRB1\" /> In an interview published on 7&nbsp;June 2015, [[Domenico Scala (manager)|Domenico Scala]], the head of FIFA's Audit And Compliance Committee, stated that \"should there be evidence that the awards to Qatar and Russia came only because of bought votes, then the awards could be cancelled\".<ref name=\"BBC News\" /><ref name=\"Owen Gibson\" /> [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge]] and former British Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] attended a meeting with FIFA vice-president [[Chung Mong-joon]] in which a vote-trading deal for the right to host the 2018 World Cup in [[England 2018 FIFA World Cup bid|England]] was discussed.<ref name=\"SNVa0\" /><ref name=\"oJlN3\" />\n\n==Teams==\n\n===Qualification===\n{{Main|2018 FIFA World Cup qualification}}\nFor the first time in the history of the FIFA World Cup, all eligible nations\u2014the 209 [[List of FIFA Member Associations|FIFA member associations]] except automatically qualified hosts Russia\u2014applied to enter the qualifying process.<ref name=\"riaYh\" /> [[Zimbabwe national football team|Zimbabwe]] and [[Indonesia national football team|Indonesia]] were later disqualified before playing their first matches,<ref name=\"zimbabwe\" /><ref name=\"indonesia\" /> while [[Gibraltar national football team|Gibraltar]] and [[Kosovo national football team|Kosovo]], who joined FIFA on 13&nbsp;May 2016 after the qualifying draw but before European qualifying had begun, also entered the competition.<ref name=\"k8fRX\" /> Places in the tournament were allocated to continental confederations, with the allocation unchanged from the 2014 World Cup.<ref name=\"fifa20150320\" /><ref name=\"hstri\" /> The first qualification game, between [[Timor-Leste national football team|Timor-Leste]] and [[Mongolia national football team|Mongolia]], began in [[Dili]] on 12&nbsp;March 2015 as part of the [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification (AFC)|AFC's qualification]],<ref name=\"45Ip9\" /> and the main qualifying draw took place at the [[Konstantinovsky Palace]] in [[Strelna]], [[Saint Petersburg]], on 25&nbsp;July 2015.<ref name=\"L1urj\" /><ref name=\"crlmz\" /><ref name=\"lzli9\" /><ref name=\"press release\" />\n\nOf the 32&nbsp;nations qualified to play at the 2018 FIFA World Cup, 20&nbsp;countries competed at the previous tournament in [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014]]. Both Iceland and Panama qualified for the first time, with the former becoming the [[List of countries and dependencies by population|smallest country in terms of population]] to reach the World Cup.<ref name=\"oGTMb\" /> Other teams returning after absences of at least three tournaments included: Egypt, returning to the finals after their last appearance in 1990; Morocco, who last competed in 1998; Peru, who last appeared in 1982; and Senegal, competing for the second time after reaching the quarter-finals in 2002. It was the first time three [[Nordic countries]] (Denmark, Iceland and Sweden) and four [[Arab world|Arab nations]] (Egypt, Morocco, Saudi Arabia and Tunisia) qualified for the World Cup.<ref name=\"vviY2\" />\n\nNotable teams that failed to qualify included: four-time champions [[Italy national football team|Italy]] (for the first time since 1958), who were knocked out in a qualification play-off by quarter-finalists Sweden, and three-time runners-up and third placed in 2014 the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] (for the first time since 2002).

/>\n\nVAR operations for all games were operated from a single headquarters in Moscow, which received live video of the games and were in radio contact with the on-field referees.<ref name=\":0\" /> Systems were in place for communicating VAR-related information to broadcasters and visuals on stadiums' large screens were used for the fans in attendance.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nVAR had a significant impact on several games.<ref name=\"nh0b0\" /> On 15&nbsp;June 2018, [[Diego Costa]]'s goal against Portugal became the first World Cup goal based on a VAR decision;<ref name=\"isPIb\" /> the first penalty as a result of a VAR decision was awarded to France in their match against Australia on 16&nbsp;June and resulted in a goal by [[Antoine Griezmann]].<ref name=\"iQyFC\" /> A record number of penalties were awarded in the tournament, a phenomenon partially attributed to VAR.<ref name=\"zeD2b\" /> Overall, the new technology was both praised and criticised by commentators.<ref name=\"neijv\" /> FIFA declared the implementation of VAR a success after the first week of competition.<ref name=\"swBxZ\" />\n\n==Venues==\nRussia proposed the following host cities: [[Kaliningrad]], [[Kazan]], [[Krasnodar]], [[Moscow]], [[Nizhny Novgorod]], [[Rostov-on-Don]], [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Samara]], [[Saransk]], [[Sochi]], [[Volgograd]], [[Yaroslavl]], and [[Yekaterinburg]].<ref name=\"b9r6N\" /> Each city was located in [[European Russia]], except [[Yekaterinburg]],<ref name=\"S3sSt\" /> which is located very close to the Europe-Asia border, to reduce travel time for the teams in the huge country. The bid evaluation report stated: \"The Russian bid proposes 13 host cities and 16 stadiums, thus exceeding FIFA's minimum requirement. Three of the 16 stadiums would be renovated, and 13 would be newly constructed.\"<ref name=\"Z1hqZ\" />\n\nIn October 2011, Russia reduced the number of stadiums from 16 to 14. Construction of the proposed [[Podolsk]] stadium in the Moscow region was cancelled by the regional government. Also, in the capital, [[Otkritie Arena]] was competing with [[VTB Arena|Dynamo Stadium]] over which would be constructed first.<ref name=\"8DESn\" />{{dead link|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe final choice of host cities was announced on 29&nbsp;September 2012. The number of cities was reduced further to 11 and the number of stadiums to 12 as Krasnodar and Yaroslavl were dropped from the final list. Of the 12 stadiums used for the tournament, three (Luzhniki, Yekaterinburg and Sochi) had been extensively renovated and the other nine were brand new; $11.8&nbsp;billion was spent on hosting the tournament.<ref name=\"VKrDx\" />\n\nSepp Blatter had said in July 2014 that, given the concerns over the completion of venues in Russia, the number of venues for the tournament may be reduced from 12 to 10.<ref name=\"Sy4OR\" /> He also said, \"We are not going to be in a situation, as is the case of one, two or even three stadiums [[2010 FIFA World Cup|in South Africa]], where it is a problem of what you do with these stadiums\".<ref name=\"saakov\" />\n[[File:EstadioCentral2017-01-26.jpg|thumb|Reconstruction of the Yekaterinburg Central Stadium in January 2017]] \nIn October 2014, on their first official visit to Russia, FIFA's inspection committee and its head, Chris Unger, visited St. Petersburg, Sochi, Kazan and both Moscow venues. They were satisfied with the progress.<ref name=\"u01d8\" /> On 8&nbsp;October 2015, FIFA and the local organising committee agreed on the official names of the stadiums to be used during the tournament.<ref name=\"AL037\" /> Of the twelve venues, the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow and the Saint Petersburg Stadium\u2014the two largest stadiums in Russia\u2014were used most; both hosted seven matches. Sochi, Kazan, Nizhny Novgorod and Samara each hosted six matches, including one quarter-final match each, while the Spartak Stadium in Moscow and Rostov-on-Don hosted five matches, including one round-of-16 match each.

The arena hosted its first match on 21&nbsp;April 2018.\n* Sochi: Fisht Stadium (renovated). This stadium hosted the opening and closing ceremonies of the [[2014 Winter Olympics]]. Afterwards, it was renovated in preparation for the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup and the 2018 World Cup.\n* Volgograd: Volgograd Arena (new). The main Volgograd arena was built on the demolished [[Central Stadium (Volgograd)|Central Stadium]] site, at the foot of the [[Mamayev Kurgan]] memorial complex. It was commissioned on 3&nbsp;April 2018.<ref name=\"j2Lhd\" />\n* Yekaterinburg: Ekaterinburg Arena (renovated). The Central Stadium of Yekaterinburg had been renovated for the FIFA World Cup.

Russia has come across as friendly and hospitable: a stark contrast with the country's authoritarian image.

After having tested the technology at limited matches of the [[2013 FIFA Confederations Cup]],<ref name=\"wPguj\" /> and the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] (via private tests and public viewings in the host city of [[Rio de Janeiro]]),<ref name=\"kVsNi\" /> the 2018 World Cup was the first World Cup in which all matches were produced in [[4K resolution|4K]] [[Ultra-high-definition television|ultra high definition]]. Host Broadcast Services (HBS) stated that at least 75% of the broadcast cut on each match would come from 4K cameras (covering the majority of main angles), with instant replays and some camera angles being upconverted from [[1080p]] high definition sources with limited degradation in quality. These broadcasts were made available from selected rightsholders and television providers.<ref name=\"TCu23\" /><ref name=\"0j6eE\" /><ref name=\"6j06c\" />\n\nIn February 2018, Ukrainian rightsholder [[UA:PBC]] stated that it would not broadcast the World Cup. This came in the wake of growing boycotts of the tournament among the [[Football Federation of Ukraine]] and sports minister [[Ihor Zhdanov]].<ref name=\"Xv82A\" /><ref name=\"0gvp3\" /> Additionally, the Football Federation of Ukraine refused to accredit journalists for the World Cup and waived their quota of tickets.<ref name=\"MLa57\" /> However, the Ukrainian state TV still broadcast the World Cup, and more than 4 million Ukrainians watched the opening match.<ref name=\"YqvyD\" />\n\nBroadcast rights to the tournament in the Middle East were hampered by an ongoing [[2017\u201318 Qatar diplomatic crisis|diplomatic crisis in Qatar]], which saw Bahrain, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates cut diplomatic ties with Qatar\u2014the home country of FIFA's Middle East and Africa rightsholder [[beIN Sports]]\u2014in June 2017, over its [[Qatar and state-sponsored terrorism|alleged state support of terrorist groups]]. On 2 June 2018, beIN pulled its channels from [[Du (company)|Du]] and [[Etisalat]], but with service to the latter restored later that day. Etisalat subsequently announced that it would air the World Cup in the UAE, and continue to offer beIN normally and without interruptions.<ref name=\"y5Kr4\" /><ref name=\"mvmPW\" /><ref name=\"jyl42\" /> In Saudi Arabia, beIN was banned from doing business; as a result, its channels and other content have been widely and illegally repackaged by a broadcaster identifying itself as \"[[beoutQ]]\". While FIFA attempted to indirectly negotiate the sale of a package consisting of Saudi matches and the final, they were unable to do so. On 12 July 2018, FIFA stated that it had \"engaged counsel to take legal action in Saudi Arabia and is working alongside other sports rights owners that have also been affected to protect its interests.\"<ref name=\"NIzbW\" /><ref name=\"6N9LV\" />\n\nIn the United States, the 2018 World Cup was the first men's World Cup whose English rights were held by [[Fox Sports (United States)|Fox Sports]], and Spanish rights held by [[Telemundo Deportes|Telemundo]]. The elimination of the United States in qualifying led to concerns that US interest and viewership of this World Cup would be reduced, noting that \"casual\" viewers of U.S. matches caused them to peak at 16.5&nbsp;million viewers in 2014, and how much Fox paid for the rights. During a launch event prior to the elimination, Fox stated that it had planned to place a secondary focus on the Mexican team in its coverage to take advantage of their popularity among [[Hispanic and Latino Americans]]. Fox stated that it was still committed to broadcasting a significant amount of coverage for the tournament.<ref name=\"lJrJH\" /><ref name=\"Oo1hn\" /><ref name=\"1M4WS\" /> Viewership was down overall over 2014, additionally citing match scheduling that was not as favourable to viewers in the Americas than 2014 (with many matches airing in the morning hours, although Telemundo's broadcast of the Mexico-Sweden Group F match was announced as being its most-watched weekday [[Daytime television|daytime]] program in network history).<ref name=\"wx1ZL\" /><ref name=\"UFMpG\" />\n\nUnlike previous tournaments, where the rights were bundled with those of South Korea, [[Korean Central Television]] acquired rights to the 2018 World Cup within North Korea. Broadcasts only began with the round of 16, and matches were tape delayed and edited for time. In addition, matches involving Japan were excluded from the broadcasts, due to [[Japan\u2013North Korea relations|strained relations and campaigns against the country]].<ref name=\"iscoP\"
