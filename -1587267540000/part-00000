Later the ''[[The Providence Journal|Providence Journal-Bulletin]]'' reported that the act was illegal according to state fish and game laws. The day of the publication, Sundlun turned himself in to the state police for arrest stating that ethics was the cornerstone of his administration. The state police reluctantly complied, so the case went to court and Sundlun pleaded guilty. But state officials and his own lawyer, [[Robert Flanders]], convinced Sundlun that his actions were not a crime because his estate did not constitute a \"compact area\" and because the threat of rabies that year had led the state to waive restrictions on shooting raccoons. His guilty plea was withdrawn and all charges were dropped.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/03/us/a-governor-shoots-but-his-guilty-plea-is-wide-of-the-mark.html|title=A Governor Shoots, But His Guilty Plea Is Wide of the Mark|publisher=New York Times October 3, 1993|accessdate=May 26, 2009|date=October 3, 1993}}</ref>\n\nAfter the raccoon shooting incident, Sundlun agreed to pose for a calendar photo for local charity wearing only a raccoon hat while aiming a shotgun and displaying his [[:File:8th Air Force.png|8th Air Force tattoo]] on his shoulder, and he occasionally showed up at downtown eateries in the middle of the night in pajamas and bathrobe to pick up coffee and a late-night snack.<ref>Rudy Cheeks, {{cite news|url=http://thephoenix.com/boston/news/124465-oh-captain-my-captain|title=''O Captain, my Captain''|newspaper=The Boston Phoenix|date=July 27, 2011|accessdate=June 2, 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn December 1997, in [[East Greenwich, Rhode Island|East Greenwich]], Sundlun attempted to purchase some plastic forks after hours from a nearby [[CVS Pharmacy]] for a Christmas party he was attending. Employees had closed their registers for the day, yet had not secured the premises. CVS workers apologized for the misunderstanding but said they could not accept payment as the transaction could not be registered due to deactivation of their cash registers. Police were called after an argument let out between Sundlun and the employees.

In 2008, he was admonished by authorities of University of Rhode Island about his driving on the campus after separate incidents in which he drove on a sidewalk, nearly hit a professor who was walking with a cane, and allegedly hit a parked car.
