The first church was a one-room log cabin, the Wilmington Lutheran Church. It was so named because most of the people who founded Arnegard came from [[Spring Grove, Minnesota]], where they belonged to the Old Wilmington Lutheran Church. The post office was established July 14, 1906 with Gerhard A. Stenehjem as postmaster. The town was incorporated in 1913 when the Great Northern Rail Road extended its line past Watford City to Arnegard.\n\nIn 1914, the town built the Arnegard School, a one-story, four room school which taught grades 1 through 12. It opened on January 29, 1915. AS second story and rear annex was built in June 1936. Included were four more classrooms and a library on the second floor, and a gym and principal's office in the rear. The annex was torn down in 1954, and a much larger gym built. By then, the Arnegard Spuds basketball team was winning games throughout the state, and wrestlers too were winning awards. In 1961, the school won the State Class C Boys' Basketball Championship. The high school closed in 1963 due to declining enrollment, but elementary school classes continued to be held in the structure until 1976. McKenzie County donated the building to the city of Arnegard shortly thereafter, and it was used as a roller skating rink, town library, and meeting hall. By the early 1980s, the second floor was considered unsafe, and the building eventually closed. In 1998, local man Milton Hanson purchased the structure and completely renovated it. It was then operated as the \"Old School Bed & Breakfast\", and has been featured on HGTV's \"If Walls Could Talk\" and Prairie Public TV's \"Old to New: Remodel, Restore, Revitalize\". In 2015 it was sold, without the bell, and is no longer a bed and breakfast.\n[[File:Arnegard, North Dakota 5-20-2008.jpg|left|thumb|Buildings in Arnegard.]]\nArnegard suffered a horrible fire on its Main Street in January 1959. Cleanup had barely begun when a second fire occurred in March. But by 1961, most of the structures on Main Street had been rebuilt.\n\nArnegard was founded with about 100 people living there, and it reached its peak population of 254 in 1930. The town weathered the [[Great Depression]] well enough, but by 1940 the population was down to just 222 (a loss of 12.5 percent). The population stayed relatively steady until 1960, but dropped by almost 40 percent to just 141 people in 1970. A brief surge in population during the 1970s oil boom (oil and natural gas deposits were found beneath McKenzie County about 1974), but the boom was followed by a bust in 1980 as drillers discovered that most of the oil was locked in shale which (at the time) could not be reached. By 1990, the population was 122, and by 2000 it was just 105. Arnegard has seen a small uptick in population in the 2000s attributable to the [[North Dakota oil boom|North Dakota Oil Boom]].\n\nOn March 6, 2019, the city's two police officers were dismissed by the city council with Mayor Virginia Elliot breaking the tie vote. The officers had recently filed a grievance citing hostile work environment. The two council members who voted to dismiss had been previously charged with crimes by the officers, while Mayor Elliot was under investigation for various crimes at the time of the dismissal.\n\n==Geography==\nArnegard is located at {{coord|47.808145|-103.438621|type:city_region:US|format=dms|display=inline}}.<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=April 23, 2011|date=February 12, 2011|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|0.25|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, all of it land.<ref name=\"Gazetteer files\">{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010 |url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |accessdate=June 14, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112090031/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |archivedate=January 12, 2012 }}</ref>\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1930= 254\n|1940= 222\n|1950= 206\n|1960= 228\n|1970= 141\n|1980= 193\n|1990= 122\n|2000= 105\n|2010= 115\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=161\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=June 27, 2019}}</ref>\n|align-fn=center\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html |title=U.S. Decennial Census |publisher=Census.gov |accessdate=May 25, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150426102944/http://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html |archivedate=April 26, 2015 }}</ref><br />2018 Estimate<ref name=\"2018 Pop Estimate\">{{cite web|title=Population Estimates|url=https://census.gov/data/tables/2018/demo/popest/total-cities-and-towns.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=June 27, 2019}}</ref>\n}}\n\n===2010 census===\nAt the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]] there were 115 people in 47 households, including 31 families, in the city.

They are a minority with their own language, churches, and social institutions. The number of [[Armenians]] in [[Egypt]] has decreased due to migrations to other countries and integration into the rest of Egyptian society, including extensive intermarriage with Muslims and Copts. Today they number about 6000, much smaller than a few generations ago. They are concentrated in [[Cairo]] and [[Alexandria]], the two largest cities. Economically the Egyptian Armenians have tended to be self-employed businessmen or craftsmen and to have more years of education than the Egyptian average.<ref name=ayman>Ayman Zohry, [http://www.zohry.com/pubs/ArmeniansinEgyptIUSSP.pdf \"Armenians in Egypt\"], International Union for the Scientific Study of Population: ''XXV International Population Conference'', year 2005.</ref>\n\n==History==\nArmenians in Egypt have had a presence since the 6th and 7th centuries.<ref name=\"hovhan\">{{cite book|last=G.

A migration of Armenian Christians to Egypt started in the early 19th century, and another wave occurred in the early 20th century.\n\nThe presence of Muslim Armenians in Egypt is well documented during and after the [[Muslim conquest of Egypt]]. Islamized Armenians under Arab rule had visible military and government positions, such as governors, generals and [[vizier]]s (and the more notable individuals are listed by name further below).<ref name=hovhan />\n\n===Fatimid period===\nThis was a prosperous period for the Armenians in Egypt, when they enjoyed commercial, cultural and religious freedom. Their numbers increased considerably as more migrants arrived from [[Syria]] and [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], fleeing the advance of the [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuk]]s westward during the second half of the 10th century. Armenian Muslims started their political life in 1074, with an estimated population of 30,000 (possibly as high as 100,000) Armenians living in [[Fatimid Caliphate]] at the time.<ref name=simon>{{cite book|last=Payaslian|first=Simon|title=The History of Armenia: From the Origins to the Present|pages=80|url=https://books.google.com/?id=7J-g7Wld1vEC&dq=egypt+armenian|isbn=9781403974679|date=2007-12-26}}</ref> A series of [[vizier]]s of Armenian origin shaped the history of the Fatimid Caliphate, beginning with [[Badr al-Jamali]] and his son [[al-Afdal Shahanshah]], up until [[Tala'i ibn Ruzzik]] and his son [[Ruzzik ibn Tala'i]].\n\n===Mamluk period===\nNearly 10,000 Armenians were captured, during invasions of the [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia]], which took place between 1266 and 1375, and were brought to Egypt as ''[[mamluk]]s'' or slave-soldiers.<ref name=kurk>{{cite book|last=M.

The youngest were educated in army camps following the Mameluke system, and later employed in the army and the palace.\n\nAt the beginning of the 14th century, a schism occurred in the Armenian church, which caused Patriarch Sargis of Jerusalem to request and obtain a firman from the Sultan Al-Malik Al-Nasir. This brought the Armenians within the Mamluk realm under the jurisdiction of the Armenian Patriarchate of [[Jerusalem]]. The schismatic Armenians who came to Egypt were given permission to practice their religion freely. Their patriarch's authority over the Armenian community's private and public affairs was decisive. The churches and those who served them were supported by the generosity of the faithful and the revenues deriving from charitable foundations.\n\n===Mohamed Ali period===\n[[File:Nubar Pasha.jpg|right|thumb|Armenian [[Nubar Pasha]] was the first [[Prime Minister of Egypt]]]]\nThe reign of [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt]] (1805\u20131849) witnessed strong migration streams of Armenians to Egypt. Mohamed Ali hired Armenians in government positions, and the Armenians were given great opportunities to contribute to the socioeconomic development of Egypt.<ref name=hovhan /> The era of Mohamed Ali witnessed building Armenian churches in Egypt; one for the Armenian Orthodox and another one for the Armenian Catholics. The number of Armenians immigrants to Egypt around this time is estimated at 2,000.<ref>{{cite book|last=Paul Adalian|first=Rouben|title=Historical Dictionary of Armenia|year=2010|publisher=Scarecrow Press|page=226|url=https://books.google.com/?id=QS-vSjHObOYC&pg=PA226&dq=armenians+in+egypt#v=onepage&q=armenians%20in%20egypt&f=false|isbn=9780810874503}}</ref> Boghos Youssufian (1768\u20131844) was an Armenian banker and businessman. In 1837, Muhammad Ali appointed Boghos as head of the Diwan Al-Tijara (bureau of commerce) and overseer of other financial affairs for Mohamed Ali.\n\nIn 1876 the Armenian Nubar Nubarian (1825\u20131899) became the first Prime Minister in modern Egypt.\n\nStarting from the 19th century Egypt became one of the centers of Armenian political and cultural life. Many prominent Armenians of that period, including [[Komitas]], [[Andranik]] and [[Martiros Sarian]] visited Egypt. The [[Armenian General Benevolent Union]] was founded in Cairo in 1906. The first Armenian film with Armenian subject called \"Haykakan Sinema\" was produced in 1912 in Cairo by Armenian-Egyptian publisher Vahan Zartarian. The film was premiered in Cairo on March 13, 1913.<ref>Armenian Cinema 100, by [[Artsvi Bakhchinyan]], Yerevan, 2012, pp. 111-112</ref>\n\n===Post-genocide (1915-1952)===\nThe [[Armenian Genocide]] started on 24 April 1915 with the [[deportation of Armenian notables in 1915|deportation of Armenian intellectuals]]. The [[Armenian diaspora|Armenian communities]] in Egypt received some percentage of the refugees and survivors of the massacres in Turkey.  The total number of Armenians in Egypt in 1917 was 12,854 inhabitants. They increased to reach its peak in 1927 census data where their total number was 17,188 inhabitants most of whom were concentrated in [[Cairo]] and [[Alexandria]]. Some independent estimates push the number of Armenians in Egypt to 40,000 inhabitants at the beginning of year 1952.<ref name=ayman /> \n\nArmenian community life in Egypt revolved around the Armenian Apostolic Church and, to a lesser extent, the Armenian Catholic Church. Over 80% of the adult Armenian population in Egypt worked as skilled [[Armenian craftsmen|craftsmen]] or in administrative positions, wholesale, retail and services. A very small number of Armenians, only around 5 per cent, worked as unskilled laborers; even fewer were [[landowners]] or [[farmer]]s. Egyptian Armenians were relatively prosperous compared to Armenians in other [[Middle Eastern]] countries; of the 150,000 Middle Eastern Armenians who emigrated to [[Soviet Armenia]] between 1946\u201348, only 4,000 were Egyptian.<ref>{{Cite journal| issn = 0026-3141| volume = 28| issue = 1| pages = 19\u201332| last = Hovannisian| first = Richard G.| title = The Ebb and Flow of the Armenian Minority in the Arab Middle East| journal = Middle East Journal| date = 1974| jstor = 4325183}}</ref>\n\nAfter the [[1952 Revolution|1952 revolution]] led by [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] many Armenians began to emigrate to [[Europe]], the [[United States]], [[Canada]] and [[Australia]].\n\n===After the 1952 Revolution===\nA reverse migration, not to the original homelands, but rather to the West, was observed among Armenian Egyptians starting in around 1956. 1956 saw the introduction of what are called the \u201cSocialist Laws\u201d in Egypt and the nationalization of many economic sectors under the Nasser regime. Since Armenian Egyptians at that time worked predominantly in the private sector and tended to monopolize basic professions and trade markets, the so-called Socialist Laws affected them more than those working in the government or in agriculture. Many migrants concluded \u2013 mistakenly or correctly \u2013 that they were threatened by the new policies of the Nasser regime and many left Egypt and migrated to the West. Since 1956 the total number of Armenian Egyptians has decreased. Accurate figures of how many left and how many are still there are not available since questions on ethnicity have not been included in censuses since the 1952 revolution.\n\n==Present day==\nMost Egyptian Armenians today, who are permanent residents of Egypt, were born in Egypt and are Egyptian citizens. [[Armenia]] to them is the collection of folkloric stories and cultural practices that each generation hands to its successor. Armenian Egyptians are full Egyptians with an extra cultural layer. They number around 6,000 and live primarily in Cairo.<ref name=ayman />\n\nToday structures such as clubs, schools, and sports facilities reinforce communications among Armenian Egyptians and revive the heritage of their forefathers. In spite of these efforts, many Armenian Egyptians of the youngest generation (and who are mostly the result of marriages between the Armenian community and other [[Egyptians]] - whether Christian or Muslim) do not speak the [[Armenian language]], or go to Armenian schools, and are not in touch with their heritage or community. The Armenian Church and the apolitical structure of the Armenian community have a very important role in unifying Armenians in Egypt. Unlike Armenian minorities in [[Syria]] and [[Lebanon]], Armenian Egyptians stay out of local politics.\n\nThe Prelacy of the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]] in [[Egypt]], which is under the jurisdiction of Holy Etchmiadzin, is the primary guardian of community assets such as endowments, real estate in the form of agricultural land, and other property bequeathed by generations of philanthropists.\n\n===Politics===\nEgyptian Armenians are very rarely involved in present-day Egyptian politics, unlike the Armenian minorities in [[Lebanon]] and [[Syria]]. However, many are employed in different political and apolitical Egyptian institutions. The Armenian Church and the apolitical structure of the institutions in the Egyptian Armenian community have a very important role in unifying the Armenians in Egypt.\n\n===Culture===\nThe Armenian community operates a number of associations, including:\n*The Armenian Red Cross Association\n*The [[Armenian General Benevolent Union]] (founded in Egypt)\n*Housaper Cultural Association.\n\nThe community has four social clubs in Cairo and two in Alexandria, in addition to three sporting clubs in the capital and two in Alexandria. There is one home for the elderly, and many activities for young people, including a dance troupe, Zankezour, a choir, Zevartnots, and a children's choir, Dzaghgasdan.\n\n===Journalism===\nToday, in Egypt, there are two daily papers and one weekly publication, all affiliated to Armenian political parties.\n \n*''[[Housaper]]'', a daily belonging to the [[Armenian Revolutionary Federation]] (Tashnag Party), was founded in 1913;\n*''[[Arev (daily)|Arev]]'', a daily, put out by the [[Armenian Democratic Liberal Party]] (Ramgavar Party), was founded in 1915\n*''[[Tchahagir]]'', a weekly founded in 1948 belonging to the [[Social Democrat Hunchakian Party]] (Hentchag Party).\n\nPeriodicals and newsletters include:\n*''[[Arev Monthly]]'', published 1997\u20132009 in Arabic as a supplement to ''Arev'' daily. It was published by the Armenian Democratic Liberal Party.\n*''[[Arek Monthly]]'', started publishing in April 2010 in Arabic. It is published by the Armenian General Benevolent Union.\n*''AGBU Deghegadou'', published since 1996 by the [[Armenian General Benevolent Union]] in [[Cairo]] as a newsletter covering AGBU's activities\n*''Dzidzernag'', a musical quarterly supplement published by [[Arev (daily)|Arev Daily]] starting 2001\n\n===Sports===\nThere are a number of Sports clubs including: \n*Homenetmen Gamk, Alexanadria founded in 1912\n*Homenetmen Ararat, Cairo founded in 1914\n*AGBU Nubar, Alexandria founded in 1924\n*AGBU Nubar, Cairo founded in 1958\n*St. Theresa Club Cairo founded in 1969\n\nSports played include [[association football]] (soccer), [[basketball]] and [[table tennis]]. Almost all the clubs also have scouting activities.\n\n===Schools and institutions===\nThe first Armenian school in Egypt, the Yeghiazarian Religious School, was established in 1828 at Bein Al-Sourein. In 1854, the school was moved to Darb Al-Geneina and the name was changed to Khorenian, after the Armenian historian Movses Khorenatsi. In 1904, [[Nubar Pasha]], an Armenian statesman, moved the Khorenian School to Boulaq. In 1907, he founded the [[Kalousdian Armenian School]] and kindergarten on Galaa Street (downtown Cairo), which is currently defunct. The second Armenian school in Egypt was founded in 1890 by Boghos Youssefian in Alexandria, and is called Boghossian School. The newest Armenian school is Nubarian in Heliopolis, founded in 1925 with a donation from Boghos Nubar. Now, Kalousdian school & Nubarian are merged as one school in Heliopolis area, Cairo.\n\nThe three Armenian schools in Egypt eventually integrate a K-12 program. Armenian 6 schools in Egypt are partially supported by the Prelacy of the Armenian Church in Egypt. Armenian education is very important in maintaining Armenian language among the Armenian community in Egypt. In Addition, Armenian language is the only language that Armenians use within their families and communities.\nThe three Armenian schools in Egypt eventually integrated a secondary education programme; students who have graduated can immediately enter the Egyptian university system, after passing the official Thanawiya 'Amma (High School) exams.\n\n===Church===\n[[File:Armenian_Catholic_Cemetery_of_Cairo.jpg|thumb|right|Armenian Catholic Cemetery of Cairo]]\nArmenian Egyptians are divided into Armenian Apostolic (known also as Orthodox or at times Gregorian) belonging to the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]] and Armenian Catholic communities belonging to the [[Armenian Catholic Church]]. There are also some Egyptian Armenians who are members of Armenian Evangelical churches.\n\nThere are five main Armenian churches in Egypt, two in Alexandria and three in Cairo.\n\nArmenian Orthodox community comprise the majority of Armenian Egyptians. \nThe Armenian Apostolic churches include:\n* Paul and Peter Armenian Apostolic Church (Alexandria)\n* St. Gregory the Illuminator Armenian Apostolic Church (Sourp Krikor Lousavoritch Armenian Apostolic Church)(in Cairo).\n\nThe Prelacy of the Armenian Church in Egypt, which is under the jurisdiction of See of Holy [[Echmiadzin]], is the primary guardian of community assets such as endowments, real estate in the form of agricultural land and other property bequeathed by generations of philanthropists.\n\nThe Armenian Catholic community has two churches:\n* Armenian Catholic Patriarchate and the Church of the Assumption (Cairo)\n* Armenian Catholic Patriarchate (in Alexandria)\n* St. Therese Armenian Catholic Church (Heliopolis, Cairo)\n\nThe Armenian Evangelical community in Egypt currently has one church:\n* Armenian Evangelical Church of Alexandria (in Alexandria) <ref>{{cite book|last=Hovyan |first=Vahram|title=ARMENIAN EVANGELICAL COMMUNITY IN EGYPT|year=2011|publisher=Noravank Foundation|page=1|url=http://www.noravank.am/eng/issues/detail.php?ELEMENT_ID=5318}}</ref>\n\n==List of famous Armenians in Egypt==\n\n===From Abbasid Era in the 7th century to the Ottoman Era of early 19th century===\nAmong the most prominent Armenians in Egypt between the Abbasid Era in the 7th century to the Ottoman Era of the early 19th century were:\n    \n* Vartan the Standard Bearer, or Wardan al-Rumi al-Armani, who saved the life of Amr Ibn al-\u2018As, the commander of the Arab army at the [[Siege of Alexandria (641)|Siege of Alexandria]] in 641. From this Vartan Al-Rumi comes the name of a market in [[Fustat]] known as the Vartan Market.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n* [[Ali al-Armani|Ali Ibn Yahya Abu\u2019l Hassan al-Armani]] \u2013 the governor of Egypt in 841 and 849, appointed by the Abbasid Caliph, the spiritual and political guide and leader of Muslims at Baghdad. The courage of Ali, \"[who was] versed in the science of war,\" is praised by the mediaeval Islamic historian Ibn Taghribirdi.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n* Ahmed Ibn Tulun - the new prefect who in 876 was commissioned by Ibn Khatib Al-Ferghani to construct his mosque in his garrison town Al-Qata\u2019i.\n* Ibn Khatib Al-Ferghani - the master builder of Armenian ancestry who rebuilt the [[Nilometer]] on the southern tip of [[Rawda Island]] to measure the rise of the water level at the annual inundation of the Nile, a critical factor for the prosperity of Egypt.\n* [[Badr al-Jamali]] - a manumitted slave of Armenian descent was called by Caliph al-Muntasir in 1073 to assist him during the Fatimid period when Egypt was weakened by inner strife and ravaged by drought, famine and epidemics. Badr's army, composed of mainly Armenian soldiers, is believed to have been formed after the fall of the [[Kingdom of Armenia (Middle Ages)|Bagratuni]] capital, [[Ani]] (1066) when waves of Armenian refugees sought shelter in other countries. Badr al-Jamali was the first military man to become the Vezir (minister) of the Sword and the Pen, thus setting the trend for a century of mostly Armenian Vezirs with the same monopoly of civilian and military powers. At the height of their power, the Armenian Vezir could count on the personal loyalty of more than 20,000 men.\n* [[Al-Afdal Shahanshah|Al-Afdal]], the son of Badr al-Jamali constructed the Palace of Vezirate, or Dar al Wizarra, besides creating two public parks with exotic gardens, and a recreation area with a man-made lake called Birket al Arman, or Armenian Lake.\n* Three brothers \u2013 all architects and masons skilled in cutting and dressing stones, who constructed the three monumental gates of Cairo: Bab al-Nasr and Bab al-Futuh in 1087 and Bab Zuwayla in 1092. The gates with their flanking towers still stand today. The ramparts and gates, which have a certain similarity to the fortifications of the Bagratuni Capital Ani, are regarded as masterpieces of military architecture by international standards.\n* Bahram al-Armani \u2013 who, after restoring order and peace in the country at the request of Caliph al-Hafiz, was appointed by the latter as the Vezir in 1135.\n* Baha al-Din Karakush - a eunuch and a Mamluk of the Kurdish general Shirkuh who in 1176 constructed a fortress, the Citadel, on the southeastern ridge of the Muqattam Hills and enclosed the new and old capitals, Cairo and Fustat, within a wall protected by the Citadel. Until the middle of the 19th century, the Citadel built by Karakush served as the seat of government fulfilling dual military and political functions.\n* Shagarat Al-Durr (or Tree of Pearls) - a female slave who dazzled everyone with her spectacular display of gold and precious stone ornaments. She was sent to Egypt by the Abbasid Caliph al-Musta\u2019sim as a gift to Sultan Salih Nagm al-Din Ayyub and became his favorite wife during his aging years. This strong-willed former slave wielded absolute power over Egypt during the transition period to Mamluk rule. She is one of the rare women in Islamic history who have ascended the throne and made a difference in the political and cultural spheres.\n* Sinan Pasha - the Ottoman Empire's chief architect of Armenian descent, who constructed the historic Mosque of Bulaq, as well as Cairo's grain market, and Bulaq's public bathroom (Hammam).\n* Amir Suleyman Bey al-Armani - held the position of Governor of Munnifeya and Gharbiyya provinces in 1690 and was so wealthy that he had Mamluks at his service.\n* Ali al-Armani and Ali Bey al-Armani Abul Azab - served as regional commanders.\n* Mustafa Jabarti - a Mamluk of Armenian descent from [[Tbilisi]] was a deputy of the agha or chief of ojak, and amassed a great fortune. He bought properties in the Armenian populated al-Zuwayla quarter and made donations to Armenians through his sister. He also built a hospice on the top floor of the quarter's St. Sarkis Church, to shelter Armenian immigrants, pilgrims and migrant workers, in need of temporary lodgings.\n* Muhammad Kehia al-Armani \u2013 an incorruptible leader who in 1798 was sent to negotiate with Napoleon Bonaparte in Alexandria to spare the population of Cairo. Napoleon was so impressed by the conciliatory tone, the political astuteness, and the diplomatic skill of the Mamluk of Armenian descent that he later appointed him the Head of Cairo's Political Affairs Administration.\n* Rustam (or Petros) - a native of [[Karabakh]] was brought to Egypt as a slave soldier. He accompanied Napoleon to France as his bodyguard, fought with the French army at the famous battle of Austerlitz, and then took part in the conquest of Spain.\n* Apraham Karakehia - an eminent money changer was asked for financial help by Mohammed Ali. The Armenian money changer supported Muhammad Ali's projects and plans and was afterwards appointed the financial representative of the Albanian General. Karakehia would become Egypt's money changer, with the honorary title of Misser Sarrafi.

They are a minority with their own language, churches, and social institutions. The number of [[Armenians]] in [[Egypt]] has decreased due to migrations to other countries and integration into the rest of Egyptian society, including extensive intermarriage with Muslims and Copts. Today they number about 6000, much smaller than a few generations ago. They are concentrated in [[Cairo]] and [[Alexandria]], the two largest cities. Economically the Egyptian Armenians have tended to be self-employed businessmen or craftsmen and to have more years of education than the Egyptian average.<ref name=ayman>Ayman Zohry, [http://www.zohry.com/pubs/ArmeniansinEgyptIUSSP.pdf \"Armenians in Egypt\"], International Union for the Scientific Study of Population: ''XXV International Population Conference'', year 2005.</ref>\n\n==History==\nArmenians in Egypt have had a presence since the 6th and 7th centuries.<ref name=\"hovhan\">{{cite book|last=G.

A migration of Armenian Christians to Egypt started in the early 19th century, and another wave occurred in the early 20th century.\n\nThe presence of Muslim Armenians in Egypt is well documented during and after the [[Muslim conquest of Egypt]]. Islamized Armenians under Arab rule had visible military and government positions, such as governors, generals and [[vizier]]s (and the more notable individuals are listed by name further below).<ref name=hovhan />\n\n===Fatimid period===\nThis was a prosperous period for the Armenians in Egypt, when they enjoyed commercial, cultural and religious freedom. Their numbers increased considerably as more migrants arrived from [[Syria]] and [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], fleeing the advance of the [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuk]]s westward during the second half of the 10th century. Armenian Muslims started their political life in 1074, with an estimated population of 30,000 (possibly as high as 100,000) Armenians living in [[Fatimid Caliphate]] at the time.<ref name=simon>{{cite book|last=Payaslian|first=Simon|title=The History of Armenia: From the Origins to the Present|pages=80|url=https://books.google.com/?id=7J-g7Wld1vEC&dq=egypt+armenian|isbn=9781403974679|date=2007-12-26}}</ref> A series of [[vizier]]s of Armenian origin shaped the history of the Fatimid Caliphate, beginning with [[Badr al-Jamali]] and his son [[al-Afdal Shahanshah]], up until [[Tala'i ibn Ruzzik]] and his son [[Ruzzik ibn Tala'i]].\n\n===Mamluk period===\nNearly 10,000 Armenians were captured, during invasions of the [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia]], which took place between 1266 and 1375, and were brought to Egypt as ''[[mamluk]]s'' or slave-soldiers.<ref name=kurk>{{cite book|last=M.

The youngest were educated in army camps following the Mameluke system, and later employed in the army and the palace.\n\nAt the beginning of the 14th century, a schism occurred in the Armenian church, which caused Patriarch Sargis of Jerusalem to request and obtain a firman from the Sultan Al-Malik Al-Nasir. This brought the Armenians within the Mamluk realm under the jurisdiction of the Armenian Patriarchate of [[Jerusalem]]. The schismatic Armenians who came to Egypt were given permission to practice their religion freely. Their patriarch's authority over the Armenian community's private and public affairs was decisive. The churches and those who served them were supported by the generosity of the faithful and the revenues deriving from charitable foundations.\n\n===Mohamed Ali period===\n[[File:Nubar Pasha.jpg|right|thumb|Armenian [[Nubar Pasha]] was the first [[Prime Minister of Egypt]]]]\nThe reign of [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt]] (1805\u20131849) witnessed strong migration streams of Armenians to Egypt. Mohamed Ali hired Armenians in government positions, and the Armenians were given great opportunities to contribute to the socioeconomic development of Egypt.<ref name=hovhan /> The era of Mohamed Ali witnessed building Armenian churches in Egypt; one for the Armenian Orthodox and another one for the Armenian Catholics.

In 1837, Muhammad Ali appointed Boghos as head of the Diwan Al-Tijara (bureau of commerce) and overseer of other financial affairs for Mohamed Ali.\n\nIn 1876 the Armenian Nubar Nubarian (1825\u20131899) became the first Prime Minister in modern Egypt.\n\nStarting from the 19th century Egypt became one of the centers of Armenian political and cultural life. Many prominent Armenians of that period, including [[Komitas]], [[Andranik]] and [[Martiros Sarian]] visited Egypt. The [[Armenian General Benevolent Union]] was founded in Cairo in 1906. The first Armenian film with Armenian subject called \"Haykakan Sinema\" was produced in 1912 in Cairo by Armenian-Egyptian publisher Vahan Zartarian. The film was premiered in Cairo on March 13, 1913.<ref>Armenian Cinema 100, by [[Artsvi Bakhchinyan]], Yerevan, 2012, pp. 111-112</ref>\n\n===Post-genocide (1915-1952)===\nThe [[Armenian Genocide]] started on 24 April 1915 with the [[deportation of Armenian notables in 1915|deportation of Armenian intellectuals]]. The [[Armenian diaspora|Armenian communities]] in Egypt received some percentage of the refugees and survivors of the massacres in Turkey.  The total number of Armenians in Egypt in 1917 was 12,854 inhabitants. They increased to reach its peak in 1927 census data where their total number was 17,188 inhabitants most of whom were concentrated in [[Cairo]] and [[Alexandria]]. Some independent estimates push the number of Armenians in Egypt to 40,000 inhabitants at the beginning of year 1952.<ref name=ayman /> \n\nArmenian community life in Egypt revolved around the Armenian Apostolic Church and, to a lesser extent, the Armenian Catholic Church. Over 80% of the adult Armenian population in Egypt worked as skilled [[Armenian craftsmen|craftsmen]] or in administrative positions, wholesale, retail and services. A very small number of Armenians, only around 5 per cent, worked as unskilled laborers; even fewer were [[landowners]] or [[farmer]]s. Egyptian Armenians were relatively prosperous compared to Armenians in other [[Middle Eastern]] countries; of the 150,000 Middle Eastern Armenians who emigrated to [[Soviet Armenia]] between 1946-48, only 4,000 were Egyptian.<ref>{{Cite journal| issn = 0026-3141| volume = 28| issue = 1| pages = 19\u201332| last = Hovannisian| first = Richard G.| title = The Ebb and Flow of the Armenian Minority in the Arab Middle East| journal = Middle East Journal| date = 1974| jstor = 4325183}}</ref>\n\nAfter the [[1952 Revolution|1952 revolution]] led by [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] many Armenians began to emigrate to [[Europe]], the [[United States]], [[Canada]] and [[Australia]].\n\n===After the 1952 Revolution===\nA reverse migration, not to the original homelands, but rather to the West, was observed among Armenian Egyptians starting in around 1956. 1956 saw the introduction of what are called the \u201cSocialist Laws\u201d in Egypt and the nationalization of many economic sectors under the Nasser regime. Since Armenian Egyptians at that time worked predominantly in the private sector and tended to monopolize basic professions and trade markets, the so-called Socialist Laws affected them more than those working in the government or in agriculture. Many migrants concluded \u2013 mistakenly or correctly \u2013 that they were threatened by the new policies of the Nasser regime and many left Egypt and migrated to the West. Since 1956 the total number of Armenian Egyptians has decreased. Accurate figures of how many left and how many are still there are not available since questions on ethnicity have not been included in censuses since the 1952 revolution.\n\n==Present day==\nMost Egyptian Armenians today, who are permanent residents of Egypt, were born in Egypt and are Egyptian citizens. [[Armenia]] to them is the collection of folkloric stories and cultural practices that each generation hands to its successor. Armenian Egyptians are full Egyptians with an extra cultural layer. They number around 6,000 and live primarily in Cairo.<ref name=ayman />\n\nToday structures such as clubs, schools, and sports facilities reinforce communications among Armenian Egyptians and revive the heritage of their forefathers. In spite of these efforts, many Armenian Egyptians of the youngest generation (and who are mostly the result of marriages between the Armenian community and other [[Egyptians]] - whether Christian or Muslim) do not speak the [[Armenian language]], or go to Armenian schools, and are not in touch with their heritage or community. The Armenian Church and the apolitical structure of the Armenian community have a very important role in unifying Armenians in Egypt. Unlike Armenian minorities in [[Syria]] and [[Lebanon]], Armenian Egyptians stay out of local politics.\n\nThe Prelacy of the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]] in [[Egypt]], which is under the jurisdiction of Holy Etchmiadzin, is the primary guardian of community assets such as endowments, real estate in the form of agricultural land, and other property bequeathed by generations of philanthropists.\n\n===Politics===\nEgyptian Armenians are very rarely involved in present-day Egyptian politics, unlike the Armenian minorities in [[Lebanon]] and [[Syria]]. However, many are employed in different political and apolitical Egyptian institutions. The Armenian Church and the apolitical structure of the institutions in the Egyptian Armenian community have a very important role in unifying the Armenians in Egypt.\n\n===Culture===\nThe Armenian community operates a number of associations, including:\n*The Armenian Red Cross Association\n*The [[Armenian General Benevolent Union]] (founded in Egypt)\n*Housaper Cultural Association.\n\nThe community has four social clubs in Cairo and two in Alexandria, in addition to three sporting clubs in the capital and two in Alexandria. There is one home for the elderly, and many activities for young people, including a dance troupe, Zankezour, a choir, Zevartnots, and a children's choir, Dzaghgasdan.\n\n===Journalism===\nToday, in Egypt, there are two daily papers and one weekly publication, all affiliated to Armenian political parties.\n \n*''[[Housaper]]'', a daily belonging to the [[Armenian Revolutionary Federation]] (Tashnag Party), was founded in 1913;\n*''[[Arev (daily)|Arev]]'', a daily, put out by the [[Armenian Democratic Liberal Party]] (Ramgavar Party), was founded in 1915\n*''[[Tchahagir]]'', a weekly founded in 1948 belonging to the [[Social Democrat Hunchakian Party]] (Hentchag Party).\n\nPeriodicals and newsletters include:\n*''[[Arev Monthly]]'', published 1997-2009 in Arabic as a supplement to ''Arev'' daily. It was published by the Armenian Democratic Liberal Party.\n*''[[Arek Monthly]]'', started publishing in April 2010 in Arabic. It is published by the Armenian General Benevolent Union.\n*''AGBU Deghegadou'', published since 1996 by the [[Armenian General Benevolent Union]] in [[Cairo]] as a newsletter covering AGBU's activities\n*''Dzidzernag'', a musical quarterly supplement published by [[Arev (daily)|Arev Daily]] starting 2001\n\n===Sports===\nThere are a number of Sports clubs including: \n*Homenetmen Gamk, Alexanadria founded in 1912\n*Homenetmen Ararat, Cairo founded in 1914\n*AGBU Nubar, Alexandria founded in 1924\n*AGBU Nubar, Cairo founded in 1958\n*St. Theresa Club Cairo founded in 1969\n\nSports played include [[association football]] (soccer), [[basketball]] and [[table tennis]]. Almost all the clubs also have scouting activities.\n\n===Schools and institutions===\nThe first Armenian school in Egypt, the Yeghiazarian Religious School, was established in 1828 at Bein Al-Sourein. In 1854, the school was moved to Darb Al-Geneina and the name was changed to Khorenian, after the Armenian historian Movses Khorenatsi. In 1904, [[Nubar Pasha]], an Armenian statesman, moved the Khorenian School to Boulaq. In 1907, he founded the [[Kalousdian Armenian School]] and kindergarten on Galaa Street (downtown Cairo), which is currently defunct. The second Armenian school in Egypt was founded in 1890 by Boghos Youssefian in Alexandria, and is called Boghossian School. The newest Armenian school is Nubarian in Heliopolis, founded in 1925 with a donation from Boghos Nubar. Now, Kalousdian school & Nubarian are merged as one school in Heliopolis area, Cairo.\n\nThe three Armenian schools in Egypt eventually integrate a K-12 program. Armenian 6 schools in Egypt are partially supported by the Prelacy of the Armenian Church in Egypt. Armenian education is very important in maintaining Armenian language among the Armenian community in Egypt. In Addition, Armenian language is the only language that Armenians use within their families and communities.\nThe three Armenian schools in Egypt eventually integrated a secondary education programme; students who have graduated can immediately enter the Egyptian university system, after passing the official Thanawiya 'Amma (High School) exams.\n\n===Church===\n[[File:Armenian_Catholic_Cemetery_of_Cairo.jpg|thumb|right|Armenian Catholic Cemetery of Cairo]]\nArmenian Egyptians are divided into Armenian Apostolic (known also as Orthodox or at times Gregorian) belonging to the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]] and Armenian Catholic communities belonging to the [[Armenian Catholic Church]]. There are also some Egyptian Armenians who are members of Armenian Evangelical churches.\n\nThere are five main Armenian churches in Egypt, two in Alexandria and three in Cairo.\n\nArmenian Orthodox community comprise the majority of Armenian Egyptians. \nThe Armenian Apostolic churches include:\n* Paul and Peter Armenian Apostolic Church (Alexandria)\n* St. Gregory the Illuminator Armenian Apostolic Church (Sourp Krikor Lousavoritch Armenian Apostolic Church)(in Cairo).\n\nThe Prelacy of the Armenian Church in Egypt, which is under the jurisdiction of See of Holy [[Echmiadzin]], is the primary guardian of community assets such as endowments, real estate in the form of agricultural land and other property bequeathed by generations of philanthropists.\n\nThe Armenian Catholic community has two churches:\n* Armenian Catholic Patriarchate and the Church of the Assumption (Cairo)\n* Armenian Catholic Patriarchate (in Alexandria)\n* St. Therese Armenian Catholic Church (Heliopolis, Cairo)\n\nThe Armenian Evangelical community in Egypt currently has one church:\n* Armenian Evangelical Church of Alexandria (in Alexandria) <ref>{{cite book|last=Hovyan |first=Vahram|title=ARMENIAN EVANGELICAL COMMUNITY IN EGYPT|year=2011|publisher=Noravank Foundation|page=1|url=http://www.noravank.am/eng/issues/detail.php?ELEMENT_ID=5318}}</ref>\n\n==List of famous Armenians in Egypt==\n\n===From Abbasid Era in the 7th century to the Ottoman Era of early 19th century===\nAmong the most prominent Armenians in Egypt between the Abbasid Era in the 7th century to the Ottoman Era of the early 19th century were:\n    \n* Vartan the Standard Bearer, or Wardan al-Rumi al-Armani, who saved the life of Amr Ibn al-\u2018As, the commander of the Arab army at the [[Siege of Alexandria (641)|Siege of Alexandria]] in 641.

Badr\u2019s army, composed of mainly Armenian soldiers, is believed to have been formed after the fall of the [[Kingdom of Armenia (Middle Ages)|Bagratuni]] capital, [[Ani]] (1066) when waves of Armenian refugees sought shelter in other countries. Badr al-Jamali was the first military man to become the Vezir (minister) of the Sword and the Pen, thus setting the trend for a century of mostly Armenian Vezirs with the same monopoly of civilian and military powers. At the height of their power, the Armenian Vezir could count on the personal loyalty of more than 20,000 men.\n* [[Al-Afdal Shahanshah|Al-Afdal]], the son of Badr al-Jamali constructed the Palace of Vezirate, or Dar al Wizarra, besides creating two public parks with exotic gardens, and a recreation area with a man-made lake called Birket al Arman, or Armenian Lake.\n* Three brothers \u2013 all architects and masons skilled in cutting and dressing stones, who constructed the three monumental gates of Cairo: Bab al-Nasr and Bab al-Futuh in 1087 and Bab Zuwayla in 1092.

The ramparts and gates, which have a certain similarity to the fortifications of the Bagratuni Capital Ani, are regarded as masterpieces of military architecture by international standards.\n* Bahram al-Armani \u2013 who, after restoring order and peace in the country at the request of Caliph al-Hafiz, was appointed by the latter as the Vezir in 1135.\n* Baha al-Din Karakush - a eunuch and a Mamluk of the Kurdish general Shirkuh who in 1176 constructed a fortress, the Citadel, on the southeastern ridge of the Muqattam Hills and enclosed the new and old capitals, Cairo and Fustat, within a wall protected by the Citadel. Until the middle of the 19th century, the Citadel built by Karakush served as the seat of government fulfilling dual military and political functions.\n* Shagarat Al-Durr (or Tree of Pearls) - a female slave who dazzled everyone with her spectacular display of gold and precious stone ornaments. She was sent to Egypt by the Abbasid Caliph al-Musta\u2019sim as a gift to Sultan Salih Nagm al-Din Ayyub and became his favorite wife during his aging years. This strong-willed former slave wielded absolute power over Egypt during the transition period to Mamluk rule. She is one of the rare women in Islamic history who have ascended the throne and made a difference in the political and cultural spheres.\n* Sinan Pasha - the Ottoman Empire\u2019s chief architect of Armenian descent, who constructed the historic Mosque of Bulaq, as well as Cairo\u2019s grain market, and Bulaq\u2019s public bathroom (Hammam).\n* Amir Suleyman Bey al-Armani - held the position of Governor of Munnifeya and Gharbiyya provinces in 1690 and was so wealthy that he had Mamluks at his service.\n* Ali al-Armani and Ali Bey al-Armani Abul Azab - served as regional commanders.\n* Mustafa Jabarti - a Mamluk of Armenian descent from [[Tbilisi]] was a deputy of the agha or chief of ojak, and amassed a great fortune. He bought properties in the Armenian populated al-Zuwayla quarter and made donations to Armenians through his sister. He also built a hospice on the top floor of the quarter\u2019s St. Sarkis Church, to shelter Armenian immigrants, pilgrims and migrant workers, in need of temporary lodgings.\n* Muhammad Kehia al-Armani \u2013 an incorruptible leader who in 1798 was sent to negotiate with Napoleon Bonaparte in Alexandria to spare the population of Cairo. Napoleon was so impressed by the conciliatory tone, the political astuteness, and the diplomatic skill of the Mamluk of Armenian descent that he later appointed him the Head of Cairo\u2019s Political Affairs Administration.\n* Rustam (or Petros) - a native of [[Karabakh]] was brought to Egypt as a slave soldier. He accompanied Napoleon to France as his bodyguard, fought with the French army at the famous battle of Austerlitz, and then took part in the conquest of Spain.\n* Apraham Karakehia - an eminent money changer was asked for financial help by Mohammed Ali. The Armenian money changer supported Muhammad Ali\u2019s projects and plans and was afterwards appointed the financial representative of the Albanian General. Karakehia would become Egypt\u2019s money changer, with the honorary title of Misser Sarrafi. That position and title would belong to the Karakehia family for generations to come.\n* Mahdesi Yeghiazar Amira Bedrossian \u2013 another money changer from Agin who was named the Wali\u2019s, or Governor\u2019s, tax collector and special counselor. The Armenian money lender not only regulated the financial services and the taxation system but also initiated safeguards against illegal land seizures.

Also, when attached to a single notehead in one part that corresponds to smaller note values in another part, it leaves no room for doubt if both the letters and the line are used.\n\nThe usual way of executing a trill, known as a '''diatonic trill''', is to rapidly alternate between the note indicated and the note directly above it in the given scale (unless the trill symbol is modified by an [[accidental (music)|accidental]], understood to apply to the added note above; this is a '''chromatic trill''').\n\n:<score vorbis=\"1\"> {\n    \\relative c'' {\n        \\time 2/4\n        g32[ a g \\set stemRightBeamCount = #1 a \\set stemLeftBeamCount = #1 g a g a]\n        g32[ a g \\set stemRightBeamCount = #1 a \\set stemLeftBeamCount = #1 g a g a]\n    }\n}\n</score>\n\n[//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/80/Trill_no-trill.ogg Listen] to an example of a short passage ending on a trill.

In many cases, the rate of the trill will not remain constant as indicated here, but will start slower and become more rapid. Whether a trill is played in this way or not is largely a matter of taste.\n\nThe number of alternations between notes can vary according to the length of the note in question. At slower [[tempo]]s a note will last longer, meaning more notes can be played in the trill, but with a fast tempo and short note a trill might be reduced to nothing more than the indicated note, the note above and the indicated note again.\n\nTrills may also be played beginning on the note above the one indicated (the ''auxiliary note''). Additionally, a trill is often ended by playing the note ''below'' the one indicated followed by the note itself.\n\n== In specific styles ==\n[[Image:Baroque Trill Instructions.svg|thumb|A table depicting how to perform different types of trills when playing music from the [[Baroque music|Baroque]] period (1600\u20131750).<ref name=\"bachspf\">Taylor, Franklin.

For those who do not like cadences, sequences, and cadential trills, baroque music is not the scene.|[[Robert Donington]], ''Baroque Music, Style and Performance''<ref name=\"Donington\"/>}}\n\nIn the [[Baroque music|baroque period]], a number of signs indicating specific patterns with which a trill should be begun or ended were used. In the ''[[Klavierb\u00fcchlein f\u00fcr Wilhelm Friedemann Bach]]'', [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] lists a number of these signs together with the correct way to interpret them. Unless one of these specific signs is indicated, the details of how to play the trill are up to the performer. In general, however, trills in this era are executed beginning on the auxiliary note, before the written note, often producing the effect of a harmonic [[suspension (music)|suspension]] which resolves to the principal note. But, if the note preceding the ornamented note is itself one scale degree above the principal note, then the dissonant note has already been stated, and the trill typically starts on the principal note.\n\nSeveral trill symbols and techniques common in the Baroque and early Classical era have fallen entirely out of use, including for instance the brief ''Pralltriller'', represented by a very brief wavy line, referred to by [[Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach]] in his ''Essay on the True Art of Playing Keyboard Instruments'' (''Versuch'') (1753\u20131762).\n\nBeyond the baroque era, specific signs for ornamentation are very rare. Continuing through the time of Mozart, the default expectations for the interpretation of trills continued to be similar to those of the baroque. In music after the time of Mozart, the trill usually begins on the principal note.\n\nAll of these are only rules of thumb, and, together with the overall rate of the trill and whether that rate is constant or variable, can only be determined by considering the context in which the trill appears, and is usually to a large degree a matter of opinion with no single \"right\" way of executing the ornament.\n\n== On specific instruments ==\n\n{{listen |\n  | filename = Bassoon-technical-trills.ogg\n  | title = Bassoon trills\n  | description = A [[bassoon]] playing several trills.\n|}}\nThe trill is frequently found in classical music for all instruments, although it is more easily executed on some than others. For example, while it is relatively easy to produce a trill on the [[flute]], the proper execution on [[brass instruments]] requires higher skill and is produced by quickly alternating partials. While playing a trill on the piano the pianist may find that it becomes increasingly difficult to execute a trill including the weak fingers of the hand (3, 4 and 5), with a trill consisting of 4 and 5 being the hardest. On the [[guitar]], a trill is a series of [[hammer-on]]s and [[pull-off]]s (generally executed using just the fingers of the fretting hand but can use both hands). Trill keys are used to rapidly alternate between a note and an adjacent note often in another register on [[woodwind instrument]]s. On the bowed instruments, the violin and the viola in particular, the trill is relatively easy to execute, with a straightforward bowing and the trill involving the oscillation of just one finger against the main note which is stopped by the finger behind, or more rarely, the open string.\n\n=== On brass instruments ===\nTrills may be performed on valveless [[brass instrument]]s by rapidly [[Slur (music)|slur]]ring between two adjacent notes by means of the [[embouchure]] \u2013 this is colloquially known as a \"lip trill.\" This was a common practice on the [[natural trumpet]]s and [[natural horn]]s of the [[Baroque Music|Baroque]]/[[European classical music|Classical]] era. However the lip trill is often still used in the modern [[French horn]] in places where the [[Harmonic series (music)|harmonics]] are only a [[Major second|tone]] apart (though this can be difficult for inexperienced players). Such trills are also a stylistic feature of [[jazz]] music, particularly in trumpet parts.\n\n=== Vocal trills ===\nVocal music of the classical tradition has included a variety of ornaments known as trills since the time of [[Giulio Caccini]]. In the preface to his [[Le nuove musiche]], he describes both the \"shake\" (what is commonly known today as the trill) and the \"trill\" (now often called a Baroque or Monteverdi trill). However, by the time of the Italian [[bel canto]] composers such as [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]], [[Gaetano Donizetti|Donizetti]] and [[Vincenzo Bellini|Bellini]], the rapid alternation between two notes that Caccini describes as a shake was known as a trill and was preferred.\n\nColoratura singers, particularly the high-voiced sopranos and tenors, are frequently required to trill not only in the works of these composers but in much of their repertoire. Soprano [[Joan Sutherland|Dame Joan Sutherland]] was particularly famed for the evenness and rapidity of her trill, and stated in interview that she \"never really had to learn how to trill\".<ref>{{youtube|XMWiQG2RuoY|Interview with Dame Joan Sutherland and Richard Bonynge<!--|accessdate=22 September 2011-->}}.</ref>  The trill is usually a feature of an ornamented solo line, but choral or chorus trills do appear.\n\nDespite the trill being written in many works for voice, a singer with an even, rapid trill is a rarity. Opinion is divided as to if and how well a trill can be taught or learnt, though mezzo-soprano [[Marilyn Horne]] frequently stated that she gained her trill by a commonly taught exercise, alternating between two notes, starting slowly and increasing velocity over time.<ref>{{youtube|NKRdpm2RfHU|Interview with Dame Joan Sutherland and Marilyn Horne<!--|accessdate=22 September 2011-->}}.</ref> The director of the [[Rossini Opera Festival]], [[Alberto Zedda]] has opined in interview that the \"widespread technical deficiency\",<ref>{{cite web |last=Hastings |first=Stephen |title=Taking the Pulse of Pesaro |url=http://www.operanews.com/operanews/templates/content.aspx?id=19997 |work=OPERA NEWS |accessdate=22 September 2011}}</ref> the inability to trill, is a source of \"frustration and anguish\". In fact, whole performances and recordings, especially of bel canto works, have been judged based on performance\u2014or lack thereof\u2014of trills, especially trills written ''in the score'' as opposed to trills in a cadenza or variation.\n\n==Trillo==\n\nThe word ''trillo'' is sometimes used to mean the same as trill. However, in [[early music]] some refer to a related ornament specifically called ''trillo'':\n\n{{quote|Trillo is the least familiar of the vocal maneuvers, and, in present day usage, is performed either on a single note or as a technique for executing rapid scale-like passages. Perceptually, it is heard as a rhythmic interruption, or near interruption, of phonation that typically begins slowly with individual pulses separated by a short silent period and then often increases in rate to something resembling a vocal imitation of machine gun firing, albeit without the accompanying cacophony.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hakes |first1=Jean |last2=Shipp |first2=Thomas |last3=Doherty |first3=E.

On the bowed instruments, the violin and the viola in particular, the trill is relatively easy to execute, with a straightforward bowing and the trill involving the oscillation of just one finger against the main note which is stopped by the finger behind, or more rarely, the open string.\n\n=== On brass instruments ===\nTrills may be performed on valveless [[brass instrument]]s by rapidly [[Slur (music)|slur]]ring between two adjacent notes by means of the [[embouchure]] \u2013 this is colloquially known as a \"lip trill.\" This was a common practice on the [[natural trumpet]]s and [[natural horn]]s of the [[Baroque Music|Baroque]]/[[European classical music|Classical]] era. However the lip trill is often still used in the modern [[French horn]] in places where the [[Harmonic series (music)|harmonics]] are only a [[Major second|tone]] apart (though this can be difficult for inexperienced players). Such trills are also a stylistic feature of [[jazz]] music, particularly in trumpet parts.\n\n=== Vocal trills ===\nVocal music of the classical tradition has included a variety of ornaments known as trills since the time of [[Giulio Caccini]]. In the preface to his [[Le nuove musiche]], he describes both the \"shake\" (what is commonly known today as the trill) and the \"trill\" (now often called a Baroque or Monteverdi trill). However, by the time of the Italian [[bel canto]] composers such as [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]], [[Gaetano Donizetti|Donizetti]] and [[Vincenzo Bellini|Bellini]], the rapid alternation between two notes that Caccini describes as a shake was known as a trill and was preferred.\n\nColoratura singers, particularly the high-voiced sopranos and tenors, are frequently required to trill not only in the works of these composers but in much of their repertoire. Soprano [[Joan Sutherland|Dame Joan Sutherland]] was particularly famed for the evenness and rapidity of her trill, and stated in interview that she \"never really had to learn how to trill\".<ref>{{youtube|XMWiQG2RuoY|Interview with Dame Joan Sutherland and Richard Bonynge<!--|accessdate=22 September 2011-->}}.</ref>  The trill is usually a feature of an ornamented solo line, but choral or chorus trills do appear.\n\nDespite the trill being written in many works for voice, a singer with an even, rapid trill is a rarity. Opinion is divided as to if and how well a trill can be taught or learnt, though mezzo-soprano [[Marilyn Horne]] frequently stated that she gained her trill by a commonly taught exercise, alternating between two notes, starting slowly and increasing velocity over time.<ref>{{youtube|NKRdpm2RfHU|Interview with Dame Joan Sutherland and Marilyn Horne<!--|accessdate=22 September 2011-->}}.</ref> The director of the [[Rossini Opera Festival]], [[Alberto Zedda]] has opined in interview that the \"widespread technical deficiency\",<ref>{{cite web |last=Hastings |first=Stephen |title=Taking the Pulse of Pesaro |url=http://www.operanews.com/operanews/templates/content.aspx?id=19997 |work=OPERA NEWS |accessdate=22 September 2011}}</ref> the inability to trill, is a source of \"frustration and anguish\". In fact, whole performances and recordings, especially of bel canto works, have been judged based on performance\u2014or lack thereof\u2014of trills, especially trills written ''in the score'' as opposed to trills in a cadenza or variation.\n\n==Trillo==\n\nThe word ''trillo'' is sometimes used to mean the same as trill. However, in [[early music]] some refer to a related ornament specifically called ''trillo'':\n\n{{quote|Trillo is the least familiar of the vocal maneuvers, and, in present day usage, is performed either on a single note or as a technique for executing rapid scale-like passages. Perceptually, it is heard as a rhythmic interruption, or near interruption, of phonation that typically begins slowly with individual pulses separated by a short silent period and then often increases in rate to something resembling a vocal imitation of machine gun firing, albeit without the accompanying cacophony.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hakes |first1=Jean |last2=Shipp |first2=Thomas |last3=Doherty |first3=E.
