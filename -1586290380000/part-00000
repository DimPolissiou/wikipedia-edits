The 285-hectare Green Oaks Biological Field Station at [[Knox College (Illinois)|Knox College]] began in 1955 under the guidance of zoologist Paul Shepard. It was followed by the 40-hectare Schulenberg Prairie at the [[Morton Arboretum]], started in 1962 by Ray Schulenberg and Bob Betz.

In 1935 Ambrose Crawford commenced restoring a degraded four acres (1.7 hectares) patch of the Big Scrub (Lowland Tropical Rainforest) at Lumley Park reserve, Alstonville, in northern New South Wales. Clearing of weeds and planting of suitable indigenous flora species were his main restoration techniques. The restored rainforest reserve still exists today and is home to threatened plant and animal species. In 1936 [[Albert Morris]] and his restoration colleagues initiated the Broken Hill regeneration area project, which involved the natural regeneration of indigenous flora on a severely degraded site of hundreds of hectares in arid western New South Wales. Completed in 1958, the successful project still maintains ecological function today as the Broken Hill Regeneration Area.<ref>Jordan, William R. & Lubick, George M.

Disturbance can occur at a variety of spatial and temporal scales, and is a natural component of many communities.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Assembly rules and restoration ecology : bridging the gap between theory and practice|date=2004|publisher=Island Press|others=Temperton, Vicky M.|isbn=9781429495134|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=|chapter=Chapter 17: Disturbance, Succession, and Community Assembly in Terrestrial Plant Communities|oclc=173134455}}</ref> For example, many forest and grassland restorations implement [[fire ecology|fire as a natural disturbance regime]]. However the severity and scope of anthropogenic impact has grown in the last few centuries. Differentiating between human-caused and naturally occurring disturbances is important if we are  to understand how to restore natural processes and minimize [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] impacts on the ecosystems.\n\n=== Succession ===\n\n[[Ecological succession]] is the process by which a community changes over time, especially following a disturbance. In many instances, an ecosystem will change from a simple level of organization with  a few dominant [[pioneer species]] to an increasingly complex community with many interdependent species. Restoration often consists of initiating, assisting, or accelerating ecological successional processes, depending on the severity of the disturbance.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Directing ecological succession|last=1955-|first=Luken, James O.|date=1990|publisher=Chapman and Hall|isbn=978-0412344503|edition= 1st |location=London|oclc=21376331}}</ref> Following mild to moderate natural and [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] disturbances, restoration in these systems involves hastening natural successional trajectories through careful management. However, in a system that has experienced a more severe disturbance (such as in urban ecosystems), restoration may require intensive efforts to recreate environmental conditions that favor natural successional processes.<ref name=wallace2017>{{cite journal |last1=Wallace |first1=K.

This both reduces the size of the populations and increases the degree of isolation. These smaller and isolated populations are more vulnerable to extinction. Fragmenting ecosystems decreases quality of the habitat. The [[Edge effects|edge of a fragment]] has a different range of environmental conditions and therefore supports different species than the interior. Restorative projects can increase the effective size of a population by adding suitable habitat and decrease isolation by creating [[wildlife corridor|habitat corridor]]s that link isolated fragments.

Some urge active restoration (e.g. eradicating invasive animals to allow the native ones to survive) and others who believe that protected areas should have the bare minimum of human interference, such as [[Rewilding (conservation biology)|rewilding]]. Ecosystem restoration has generated controversy. Skeptics doubt that the benefits justify the economic investment or who point to failed restoration projects and question the feasibility of restoration altogether. It can be difficult to set restoration goals, in part because, as Anthony Bradshaw claims, \"ecosystems are not static, but in a state of dynamic equilibrium\u2026. [with restoration] we aim [for a] moving target.\"\n\nSome{{Vague|date=December 2018}} conservationists argue that, though an ecosystem may not be returned to its original state, the functions of the ecosystem (especially ones that provide services to us) may be more valuable in its current configuration (Bradshaw 1987). This is especially true in cases where the ecosystem services are central to the physical and cultural survival of human populations, as is the case with many Native groups in the United States and other communities around the world who subsist using ecological services and environmental resources.<ref name=\":13\"/>  One reason to consider ecosystem restoration is to mitigate climate change through activities such as afforestation. [[Afforestation]] involves replanting forests, which remove carbon dioxide from the air. [[Carbon dioxide]] is a leading cause of [[global warming]] (Speth, 2005) and capturing it would help alleviate climate change. Another example of a common driver of restoration projects in the United States is the legal framework of the Clean Water Act, which often requires mitigation for damage inflicted on aquatic systems by development or other activities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/cwa-404/compensatory-mitigation-methods|title=Compensatory Mitigation Methods|last=|first=|date=2015-08-20|website=United States Environmental Protection Agency|access-date=June 4, 2018}}</ref>\n[[File:Restored Prairie at the West Eugene Wetlands (8745659774).jpg|thumb|252x252px|Restored [[prairie]] at the West Eugene Wetlands in [[Eugene, Oregon]]. ]]\n\n== Challenges ==\nSome view ecosystem restoration as impractical, partially because restorations often fall short of their goals.

Ecological restoration is then a part of the resulting [[conservation movement]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nBoth restoration ecologists and conservation biologists agree that protecting and restoring habitat is important for protecting biodiversity. However, [[conservation biology]] is primarily rooted in [[population biology]]. Because of that, it is generally organized at the [[Population genetics|population genetic]] level and assesses specific species populations (i.e. [[endangered species]]). Restoration ecology is organized at the [[Community (ecology)|community]] level, which focuses on broader groups within ecosystems.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite journal|last=Young|first=Truman P|date=2000|title=Restoration ecology and conservation biology|journal=Biological Conservation|volume=92|issue=1|pages=73\u201383|doi=10.1016/s0006-3207(99)00057-9|issn=0006-3207|citeseerx=10.1.1.493.1604}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, conservation biology often concentrates on [[vertebrate]] animals because of their salience and popularity, whereas restoration ecology concentrates on [[plant]]s. Restoration ecology focuses on plants because restoration projects typically begin by establishing plant communities. Ecological restoration, despite being focused on plants, may also have \"poster species\" for individual ecosystems and restoration projects.<ref name=\":7\" /> For example, the [[Monarch butterfly]] is a poster species for conserving and restoring [[Asclepias|milkweed]] plant habitat, because Monarch butterflies require milkweed plants to reproduce. Finally, restoration ecology has a stronger focus on [[soil]]s, [[soil structure]], [[Fungus|fungi]], and [[microorganism]]s because soils provide the foundation of functional terrestrial ecosystems.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Allen|first=Craig D|date=2002|title=Ecological restoration of southwestern Ponderosa pine ecosystems: A broad perspective|url=|journal=Ecological Applications|volume=12|issue=5|pages=1418\u20131433|doi=10.1890/1051-0761(2002)012[1418:EROSPP]2.0.CO;2}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Harris|first=J.

In 1935 Ambrose Crawford commenced restoring a degraded four acres (1.7 hectares) patch of the Big Scrub (Lowland Tropical Rainforest) at Lumley Park reserve, Alstonville, in northern New South Wales. Clearing of weeds and planting of suitable indigenous flora species were his main restoration techniques. The restored rainforest reserve still exists today and is home to threatened plant and animal species. In 1936 [[Albert Morris]] and his restoration colleagues initiated the Broken Hill regeneration area project, which involved the natural regeneration of indigenous flora on a severely degraded site of hundreds of hectares in arid western New South Wales. Completed in 1958, the successful project still maintains ecological function today as the Broken Hill Regeneration Area.<ref>Jordan, William R. & Lubick, George M.

Disturbance can occur at a variety of spatial and temporal scales, and is a natural component of many communities.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Assembly rules and restoration ecology : bridging the gap between theory and practice|date=2004|publisher=Island Press|others=Temperton, Vicky M.|isbn=9781429495134|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=|chapter=Chapter 17: Disturbance, Succession, and Community Assembly in Terrestrial Plant Communities|oclc=173134455}}</ref> For example, many forest and grassland restorations implement [[fire ecology|fire as a natural disturbance regime]]. However the severity and scope of anthropogenic impact has grown in the last few centuries. Differentiating between human-caused and naturally occurring disturbances is important if we are  to understand how to restore natural processes and minimize [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] impacts on the ecosystems.\n\n=== Succession ===\n\n[[Ecological succession]] is the process by which a community changes over time, especially following a disturbance. In many instances, an ecosystem will change from a simple level of organization with  a few dominant [[pioneer species]] to an increasingly complex community with many interdependent species. Restoration often consists of initiating, assisting, or accelerating ecological successional processes, depending on the severity of the disturbance.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Directing ecological succession|last=1955-|first=Luken, James O.|date=1990|publisher=Chapman and Hall|isbn=978-0412344503|edition= 1st |location=London|oclc=21376331}}</ref> Following mild to moderate natural and [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] disturbances, restoration in these systems involves hastening natural successional trajectories through careful management. However, in a system that has experienced a more severe disturbance (such as in urban ecosystems), restoration may require intensive efforts to recreate environmental conditions that favor natural successional processes.<ref name=wallace2017>{{cite journal |last1=Wallace |first1=K.

This both reduces the size of the populations and increases the degree of isolation. These smaller and isolated populations are more vulnerable to extinction. Fragmenting ecosystems decreases quality of the habitat. The [[Edge effects|edge of a fragment]] has a different range of environmental conditions and therefore supports different species than the interior. Restorative projects can increase the effective size of a population by adding suitable habitat and decrease isolation by creating [[wildlife corridor|habitat corridor]]s that link isolated fragments. Reversing the effects of fragmentation is an important component of restoration ecology.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Targeted habitat restoration can reduced extinction rates in fragrmented forests|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=114|issue=36|pages=9635\u20139640|doi=10.1073/pnas.1705834114|pmid=28827340|pmc=5594666|year=2017|last1=Newmark|first1=William D.|last2=Jenkins|first2=Clinton N.|last3=Pimm|first3=Stuart L.|last4=McNeally|first4=Phoebe B.|last5=Halley|first5=John M.}}</ref>\n\n=== Ecosystem function ===\nEcosystem function describes the most basic and essential foundational processes of any natural systems, including [[nutrient cycle]]s and [[Energy flow (ecology)|energy flux]]es.

Ecosystem functions are [[emergent properties]] of the [[Systems theory|system as a whole]], thus monitoring and [[Natural resource management|management]] are crucial for the long-term stability of ecosystems. A fully functional ecosystem that is completely self-perpetuating is the ultimate goal of restorative efforts.

Some urge active restoration (e.g. eradicating invasive animals to allow the native ones to survive) and others who believe that protected areas should have the bare minimum of human interference, such as [[Rewilding (conservation biology)|rewilding]]. Ecosystem restoration has generated controversy. Skeptics doubt that the benefits justify the economic investment or who point to failed restoration projects and question the feasibility of restoration altogether. It can be difficult to set restoration goals, in part because, as Anthony Bradshaw claims, \"ecosystems are not static, but in a state of dynamic equilibrium\u2026. [with restoration] we aim [for a] moving target.\"\n\nSome{{Vague|date=December 2018}} conservationists argue that, though an ecosystem may not be returned to its original state, the functions of the ecosystem (especially ones that provide services to us) may be more valuable in its current configuration (Bradshaw 1987). This is especially true in cases where the ecosystem services are central to the physical and cultural survival of human populations, as is the case with many Native groups in the United States and other communities around the world who subsist using ecological services and environmental resources.<ref name=\":13\"/>  One reason to consider ecosystem restoration is to mitigate climate change through activities such as afforestation. [[Afforestation]] involves replanting forests, which remove carbon dioxide from the air. [[Carbon dioxide]] is a leading cause of [[global warming]] (Speth, 2005) and capturing it would help alleviate climate change. Another example of a common driver of restoration projects in the United States is the legal framework of the Clean Water Act, which often requires mitigation for damage inflicted on aquatic systems by development or other activities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/cwa-404/compensatory-mitigation-methods|title=Compensatory Mitigation Methods|last=|first=|date=2015-08-20|website=United States Environmental Protection Agency|access-date=June 4, 2018}}</ref>\n[[File:Restored Prairie at the West Eugene Wetlands (8745659774).jpg|thumb|252x252px|Restored [[prairie]] at the West Eugene Wetlands in [[Eugene, Oregon]]. ]]\n\n== Challenges ==\nSome view ecosystem restoration as impractical, partially because restorations often fall short of their goals.  Hilderbrand et al. point out that many times uncertainty (about ecosystem functions, species relationships, and such) is not addressed, and that the time-scales set out for 'complete' restoration are unreasonably short, while other critical markers for full-scale restoration are either ignored or abridged due to feasibility concerns.<ref name=\":9\">Hilderbrand, R.

Ecological restoration is then a part of the resulting [[conservation movement]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nBoth restoration ecologists and conservation biologists agree that protecting and restoring habitat is important for protecting biodiversity. However, [[conservation biology]] is primarily rooted in [[population biology]]. Because of that, it is generally organized at the [[Population genetics|population genetic]] level and assesses specific species populations (i.e. [[endangered species]]). Restoration ecology is organized at the [[Community (ecology)|community]] level, which focuses on broader groups within ecosystems.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite journal|last=Young|first=Truman P|date=2000|title=Restoration ecology and conservation biology|journal=Biological Conservation|volume=92|issue=1|pages=73\u201383|doi=10.1016/s0006-3207(99)00057-9|issn=0006-3207|citeseerx=10.1.1.493.1604}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, conservation biology often concentrates on [[vertebrate]] animals because of their salience and popularity, whereas restoration ecology concentrates on [[plant]]s. Restoration ecology focuses on plants because restoration projects typically begin by establishing plant communities. Ecological restoration, despite being focused on plants, may also have \"poster species\" for individual ecosystems and restoration projects.<ref name=\":7\" /> For example, the [[Monarch butterfly]] is a poster species for conserving and restoring [[Asclepias|milkweed]] plant habitat, because Monarch butterflies require milkweed plants to reproduce. Finally, restoration ecology has a stronger focus on [[soil]]s, [[soil structure]], [[Fungus|fungi]], and [[microorganism]]s because soils provide the foundation of functional terrestrial ecosystems.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Allen|first=Craig D|date=2002|title=Ecological restoration of southwestern Ponderosa pine ecosystems: A broad perspective|url=|journal=Ecological Applications|volume=12|issue=5|pages=1418\u20131433|doi=10.1890/1051-0761(2002)012[1418:EROSPP]2.0.CO;2}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Harris|first=J.

description|List of notable individuals who died in 2020}}\nThe following deaths of notable individuals occurred in 2020. Names are reported under the date of death, in alphabetical order by surname or pseudonym.\n\nA typical entry reports information in the following sequence:\n\n* Name, age, country of citizenship at birth, subsequent [[nationality]] (if applicable), what subject was noted for, cause of death (if known), and reference.\n\n<!--\n* * * * * * * Please adhere to the guidelines below when adding a name to this article. * * * * * * *\n\nA typical entry reports information in the following sequence: Name, age, country of citizenship at birth or nationality if the subject is not eligible (for example, in the case of animals), subsequent nationality (if applicable), what subject was noted for, cause of death (if known), and reference. Do not place a period at the end of the entry. Names are reported under the date of death. Names under each date are reported in alphabetical order by surname or pseudonym.\n\n(1) Please add only those meeting Wikipedia notability guidelines. Include a reference to a reliable source.[a] [b] If a Wikipedia article for the dead does not yet exist, reconsider whether the subject is actually notable. If so, consider writing an article yourself. Those without a Wikipedia article are removed after one month.\n\n(2) Please understand that the intent of this article is to report notable deaths. Tragic deaths, while unfortunate, do not necessarily render the dead \"notable\". If you report the death of a notable subject that does not already have a Wikipedia article, consider starting one. Include third-party sources other than the obituary.\n\n(3) Please add entries in alphabetical order by family name. Please avoid over-linking. As such, please do not add links to nationalities, common occupations, or common causes of death. Rather, include only \"links that aid navigation and understanding\". Thank you.\n\n(4) References should be in <ref>[url & title]</ref> format, as full citations make the page too slow to load, and too big to edit.\n\n--Notes--\n[a] See [[WP:RS]] for definition of reliable source, and [[WP:BLPSOURCE]] for living and recently deceased persons.\n[b] For information on using information from Ancestry.com, Find-a-grave, or IMDb, please see [[WP:ELPEREN]].\n* * * * * * * Please adhere to the guidelines above when adding a name to this article. * * * * * * *\n\n--->\n{{TOC right}}\n\n==April==\n===8===\n\n===7===\n*[[Robert Chaudenson]], 82, French [[Creole language|Creole]] linguist, COVID-19.<ref>[https://la1ere.francetvinfo.fr/reunion/robert-chaudenson-a-succombe-au-covid-19-820596.html Robert Chaudenson, le d\u00e9fenseur du Cr\u00e9ole R\u00e9unionnais, a succomb\u00e9 au Covid-19] {{in lang|fr}}</ref>\n*[[Jean-Laurent Cochet]], 85, French stage director and actor (''[[A Thousand Billion Dollars]]'', ''[[Fort Saganne]]''), COVID-19.<ref>[https://www.lefigaro.fr/culture/mort-de-jean-laurent-cochet-le-maitre-de-theatre-de-depardieu-huppert-auteuil-beart-20200407 Mort de Jean-Laurent Cochet, le ma\u00eetre de th\u00e9\u00e2tre de Depardieu, Huppert, Auteuil, B\u00e9art...] {{in lang|fr}}</ref>\n*[[Fariborz Esmaeili]], 79, Iranian footballer ([[Taj SC|Taj]], [[Iran national football team|national team]]).<ref>[https://www.tehrantimes.com/news/446583/Ex-Iran-forward-Esmaeili-passes-away Ex-Iran forward Esmaeili passes away]</ref>\n*[[Sasi Kalinga]], 59, Indian actor (''[[Paleri Manikyam: Oru Pathirakolapathakathinte Katha (film)|Paleri Manikyam: Oru Pathirakolapathakathinte Katha]]'', ''[[Pranchiyettan & the Saint]]'', ''[[Indian Rupee (film)|Indian Rupee]]''), liver disease.<ref>[https://english.manoramaonline.com/news/kerala/2020/04/07/sasi-kallinga-malayalam-actor-passes-away.html Actor Sasi Kalinga passes away]</ref>\n*[[Mishik Kazaryan]], 72, Russian physicist, COVID-19.<ref>[https://www.svoboda.org/a/30537605.html \u041f\u0440\u043e\u0444\u0435\u0441\u0441\u043e\u0440-\u0444\u0438\u0437\u0438\u043a \u041c\u0438\u0448\u0438\u043a \u041a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0440\u044f\u043d \u0443\u043c\u0435\u0440 \u0432 \u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0432\u0435 \u043e\u0442 \u043e\u0441\u043b\u043e\u0436\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0439 COVID-19] {{in lang|ru}}</ref>\n*{{ill|Jan K\u0159en|cs}}, 89, Czech historian, academic, and dissident, COVID-19.<ref>[https://denikn.cz/minuta/336066/ Ve v\u011bku 89 let zem\u0159el profesor, historik a disident Jan K\u0159en.] {{in lang|cs}}</ref>\n*[[Yaakov Perlow]], 89, American [[Novominsker Rebbe]], president of [[Agudath Israel of America|Agudah]], COVID-19.<ref>[https://www.jewishpress.com/news/us-news/ny/head-of-agudath-israel-the-novominsker-rebbe-succumbs-to-the-coronavirus-at-89/2020/04/07/ Head of Agudath Israel, the Novominsker Rebbe, Succumbs to the Coronavirus at 89]</ref>\n*[[Nipper Read]], 95, British police officer and boxing administrator.<ref>[https://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/latest-news/breaking-leonard-nipper-read-dead-21826825 Leonard 'Nipper' Read dead: Police officer who brought Krays to justice dies]</ref>\n*[[Hal Willner]], 64, American music producer (''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', ''[[Stay Awake: Various Interpretations of Music from Vintage Disney Films|Stay Awake]]''), COVID-19. <ref>[https://variety.com/2020/music/obituaries-people-news/hal-willner-dead-dies-music-producer-saturday-night-live-1234573202/ Hal Willner, Music Producer and \u2018SNL\u2019 Veteran, Dies of Coronavirus at 64]</ref>\n*{{ill|Harry Wouters van den Oudenweijer|nl}}, 86, Dutch show jumper (European Champion 1977)<ref>[https://www.horses.nl/overig-nieuws/overlijden/ek-gouden-springruiter-harry-wouters-overleden/ EK-gouden springruiter Harry Wouters overleden]</ref>\n\n===6===\n*[[Radomir Anti\u0107]], 71, Serbian football player ([[FK Partizan|Partizan]]) and manager ([[Atl\u00e9tico Madrid]], [[Serbia national football team|national team]]), pancreatitis.<ref>[https://onefootball.com/en/news/legendary-laliga-boss-radomir-antic-passes-away-29642192 Legendary LaLiga boss Radomir Anti\u0107 passes away]</ref>\n*[[M.

A series of air refuelings can give range limited only by crew fatigue and engineering factors such as engine oil consumption. Because the receiver aircraft can be topped up with extra fuel in the air, air refueling can allow a [[takeoff]] with a greater [[Payload (air and space craft)|payload]] which could be weapons, cargo, or personnel: the [[maximum takeoff weight]] is maintained by carrying less fuel and topping up once airborne. Alternatively, a shorter take-off roll can be achieved because take-off can be at a lighter weight before refueling once airborne. Aerial refueling has also been considered as a means to reduce fuel consumption on long-distance flights greater than {{convert|3000|nmi}}. Potential fuel savings in the range of 35\u201340% have been estimated for long-haul flights (including the fuel used during the tanker missions).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Nangia |first=R.K |title=Operations and aircraft design towards greener civil aviation using air-to-air refuelling |journal=The Aeronautical Journal |date=November 2006 |volume=Paper No. 3088. |issue=November |pages=705\u2013721 |url=http://www.greenerbydesign.org.uk/_FILES/publications/3088.pdf |accessdate=20 October 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021064242/http://www.greenerbydesign.org.uk/_FILES/publications/3088.pdf |archivedate=21 October 2013 }}</ref>\n\nUsually, the aircraft providing the fuel is specially designed for the task, although refueling pods can be fitted to existing aircraft designs if the \"probe-and-drogue\" system is to be used.  The cost of the refueling equipment on both tanker and receiver aircraft and the specialized aircraft handling of the aircraft to be refueled (very close \"line astern\" formation flying) has resulted in the activity only being used in military operations. There is no known regular civilian in-flight refueling activity. Originally employed shortly before [[World War II]] on a very limited scale to extend the range of British civilian transatlantic [[flying boat]]s, and then after World War II on a large scale to extend the range of [[strategic bomber]]s, aerial refueling since the [[Vietnam War]] has been extensively used in large-scale military operations. For instance, in the [[Gulf War]] and the Iraqi [[invasion of Kuwait]] and the [[Iraq War]], all coalition air sorties were air-refueled except for a few short-range ground attack sorties in the Kuwait area.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n\n==History and development==\n\n===Early experiments===\n[[File:Refueling, 1923.jpg|thumb|left|[[Captain (land)|Capt.]] [[Lowell Smith]] and Lt. John P. Richter receiving the first mid-air refueling on June 27, 1923]]\nSome of the earliest experiments in aerial refueling took place in the 1920s; two slow-flying aircraft flew in formation, with a hose run down from a hand-held fuel tank on one aircraft and placed into the usual fuel filler of the other. The first mid-air refueling, based on the development of [[Alexander P. de Seversky]], between two planes occurred on June 27, 1923, between two [[Airco DH-4B]] [[biplane]]s of the [[United States Army Air Service]]. An endurance record was set by three DH-4Bs (a receiver and two tankers) on August 27\u201328, 1923, in which the receiver airplane remained aloft for more than 37 hours using nine mid-air refuelings to transfer {{convert|687|usgal|L}} of [[aviation gasoline]] and {{convert|38|usgal|L}} of engine oil. The same crews demonstrated the utility of the technique on October 25, 1923, when a DH-4 flew from [[Sumas, Washington]], on the [[Canada\u2013United States border]], to [[Tijuana, Mexico]], landing in [[San Diego]], using mid-air refuelings at [[Eugene, Oregon]], and [[Sacramento, California]].\n\nSimilar trial demonstrations of mid-air refueling technique took place at the [[Royal Aircraft Establishment]] in [[England]] and by the [[Arm\u00e9e de l'Air]] in [[France]] in the same year, but these early experiments were not yet regarded as a practical proposition, and were generally dismissed as stunts.\n\nAs the 1920s progressed, greater numbers of aviation enthusiasts vied to set new aerial long-distance records, using inflight air refueling. One such enthusiast, who would revolutionize aerial refueling was Sir [[Alan Cobham]], member of the [[Royal Flying Corps]] in [[World War I]], and a pioneer of long-distance aviation. During the 1920s, he made long-distance flights to places as far afield as [[Africa]] and [[Australia]] and he began experimenting with the possibilities of in-flight refueling to extend the range of flight.<ref>Colin Cruddas, ''Highways to the Empire'' (Air Britain, 2006, {{ISBN|0-85130-376-5}}); G.H.

Pirie, ''Cultures and Caricatures of British imperial Aviation: Passengers, Pilots, Publicity'' (Manchester University Press, 2012), Chapter 4.</ref>\n\nCobham was one of the founding directors of [[Airspeed Ltd.|Airspeed Limited]], an aircraft manufacturing company which went on to produce a specially adapted [[Airspeed Courier]] that Cobham used for his early experiments with in-flight refueling. This craft was eventually modified by Airspeed to Cobham's specification, for a non-stop flight from [[London]] to [[India]], using in-flight refueling to extend the plane's flight duration.\n\nMeanwhile, in 1929, a group of [[United States Army Air Corps|U.S. Army Air Corps]] fliers, led by then Major [[Carl Andrew Spaatz|Carl Spaatz]], set an endurance record of over 150 hours with the [[Question Mark (airplane)|''Question Mark'']] over Los Angeles.  Between June 11 and July 4, 1930, the brothers John, Kenneth, Albert, and Walter Hunter set a new record of 553 hours 40 minutes over Chicago using two [[Stinson Detroiter|Stinson SM-1 Detroiters]] as refueler and receiver. Aerial refueling remained a very dangerous process until 1935, when brothers [[The Flying Keys|Fred and Al Key]] demonstrated a spill-free refueling nozzle, designed by A. D. Hunter.<ref>There is no indication that any relationship exists between A.D. Hunter and the Hunter brothers.</ref> They exceeded the Hunters' record by nearly 100 hours in a [[Curtiss Robin]] monoplane [https://web.archive.org/web/20090416144548/http://www.nasm.si.edu/imagedetail.cfm?imageID=1150], staying aloft for more than 27 days.<ref name=\"HistAv19\">History of Aviation, Part 19, 1938</ref>\n\nThe US was mainly concerned about transatlantic flights for faster postal service between Europe and America. In 1931 W. Irving Glover, the second assistant postmaster, wrote an extensive article for ''Popular Mechanics'' concerning the challenges and the need for such a regular service. In his article he even mentioned the use of aerial refueling after takeoff as a possible solution.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=Popular Mechanics|author=Hearst Magazines|title=Wings Across The Atlantic|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u-IDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA186|date=February 1931|publisher=Hearst Magazines|page=190}}</ref>\n\nAt [[Le Bourget Airport]] near Paris, the [[A\u00e9ro-Club de France]] and the 34th Aviation Regiment of the [[French Air Force]] were able to demonstrate passing fuel between machines at the annual aviation fete at [[Vincennes]] in 1928.<ref>Flight Magazine archive, January 10, 1929</ref> The UK's [[Royal Aircraft Establishment]] was also running mid-air refueling trials, with the aim to use this technique to extend the range of the long-distance [[flying boats]] that serviced the [[British Empire]]. By 1931 they had demonstrated refueling between two [[Vickers Virginia]]s, with fuel flow controlled by an automatic valve on the hose which would cut off if contact was lost.<ref>Flight Magazine archive, July 3, 1931, p.&nbsp;623</ref>\n\n[[Royal Air Force]] [[officer]] [[Richard Atcherley]] had observed the dangerous aerial-refueling techniques in use at [[barnstorming]] events in the US and determined to create a workable system.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Richard K.

In 1934, Cobham sold off the airline Cobham Air Routes Ltd to [[Morton Air Services#Olley Air Service|Olley Air Service]] and turned to the development of inflight refueling, founding the company [[Flight Refuelling Ltd]]. Atcherly's system was bought up by Cobham's company, and with some refinement and continuous improvement through the late '30s, it became the first practical refueling system.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gaflight.org/midair%20refueling%20p1.htm|title=Mid-air refuelling in Gander}}</ref>\n\n====Grappled-line looped-hose====\n[[File:'Lucky Lady II\" being refuelled by B-29M 45-21708 061215-F-1234S-002.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|right|The US Air Force [[Boeing B-50 Superfortress]] ''[[Lucky Lady II]]'' being refueled by grappled-line looped-hose during the first non-stop circumnavigation of the world by air (1949)]]\nSir [[Alan Cobham]]'s ''grappled-line looped-hose'' air-to-air refueling system borrowed from techniques patented by David Nicolson and John Lord, and was publicly demonstrated for the first time in 1935. In the system the receiver aircraft, at one time an [[Airspeed Courier]], trailed a steel cable which was then grappled by a line shot from the tanker, a [[Handley Page Type W#W10|Handley Page Type W10]]. The line was then drawn back into the tanker where the receiver's cable was connected to the refueling hose. The receiver could then haul back in its cable bringing the hose to it. Once the hose was connected, the tanker climbed sufficiently above the receiver aircraft to allow the fuel to flow under gravity.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=Popular Science|author=Bonnier Corporation|title=Gas Station In The Sky|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KSYDAAAAMBAJ&pg=RA2-PA82|date=January 1947|publisher=Bonnier Corporation|page=2}}</ref><ref>[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1945/1945%20-%202295.html?search=Flight%20Refuelling '' \"Refuelling In Flight\" '', Flight Magazine, November 22, 1945] close-up drawing of receiver pawl grapnel and tanker haul line projectile</ref>\n\nWhen Cobham was developing his system, he saw the need as purely for long-range transoceanic commercial aircraft flights,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1947/1947%20-%200392.html|title=flight march - receiver aircraft - advertisements flight - 1947 - 0392 - Flight Archive|publisher=|accessdate=19 November 2016}}</ref> but today aerial refueling is used exclusively by military aircraft.\n\nIn 1934, Cobham had founded [[Flight Refuelling Ltd]] and by 1938 had used FRL's ''looped-hose'' system to refuel aircraft as large as the [[Short Empire]] flying boat ''Cambria'' from an [[Armstrong Whitworth AW.23]].<ref name=\"HistAv19\"/> [[Handley Page H.P.54 Harrow|Handley Page Harrows]] were used in the 1939 trials to perform aerial refueling of the Empire flying boats for regular transatlantic crossings.

After the war ended, the USAF bought a small number of FRL looped-hose units and fitted a number of B-29s as tankers to refuel specially equipped B-29s and later B-50s. The USAF made only one major change between the system used by the RAF. The USAF version had auto-coupling of the refueling nozzle, where the leader line with the refueling hose is pulled to the receiver aircraft and a refueling receptacle on the belly of the aircraft, allowing high-altitude air-to-air refueling and doing away with the aircraft having to fly to a lower altitude to be depressurized so a crew member could manually do the coupling.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=Popular Science|author=Bonnier Corporation|title=What Can Our Bombers Do Now?|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QCgDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA79|date=August 1948|publisher=Bonnier Corporation|page=79}}</ref>\n\nThis air-to-air refueling system was used by the [[B-50 Superfortress]] ''[[Lucky Lady II]]'' of the 43rd Bomb Wing to make its famous first non-stop around-the-world flight in 1949.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1949/1949%20-%200461.html|title=flight - lucky lady - flight refuelling - 1949 - 0461 - Flight Archive|publisher=|accessdate=19 November 2016}}</ref><ref>'' \"B-50s In Great Britain\" '', Flight magazine, September 1, 1949</ref> From February 26 to March 3, 1949, ''Lucky Lady II'' flew non-stop around the world in 94&nbsp;hours and 1&nbsp;minute, a feat made possible by four aerial refuelings from four pairs of [[Boeing KB-29|KB-29M]] tankers of the 43d ARS. Before the mission, crews of the 43d had experienced only a single operational air refueling contact. The flight started and ended at [[Carswell Air Force Base]] in [[Fort Worth, Texas]] with the refuelings accomplished over [[the Azores]], [[West Africa]], the Pacific Ocean near [[Guam]], and between [[Hawaii]] and the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hallex|first=Steve|title=Around the World in 94 Hours*|journal=Logbook|volume= 14| issue =  1, 1st Quarter 2016}}</ref>\n\nThis first non-stop circumnavigation of the globe proved that, because of aerial refueling, vast distances and geographical barriers were no longer an obstacle to military air power. In 1949, four additional ARS units were organized by the USAF and both the 43d and 509th ARS became fully operational.\n\n====Probe-and-drogue system====\nCobham's company FRL soon realized that their looped-hose system left a lot to be desired and began work on an improved system that is now commonly called the ''probe-and-drogue'' air-to-air refueling system and today is one of the two systems chosen by air forces for air-to-air refueling, the other being the flying-boom system. In post-war trials the RAF used a modified Lancaster tanker employing the much improved probe-and-drogue system, with a modified [[Gloster Meteor|Gloster Meteor F.3]] jet fighter, [[United Kingdom military aircraft serials|serial]] ''EE397'', fitted with a nose-mounted probe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cobham75.com/cobham-the-company-1934-1985/air-to-air-refuelling-takes-off.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-11-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708171825/http://www.cobham75.com/cobham-the-company-1934-1985/air-to-air-refuelling-takes-off.aspx |archivedate=2011-07-08 }}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=Popular Science|author=Bonnier Corporation|title=Jet Refuels Like Humming Bird|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=giQDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA131|date=October 1949|publisher=Bonnier Corporation|page=131}}</ref> On 7 August 1949, the Meteor flown by FRL [[test pilot]] Pat Hornidge took off from [[RAF Tarrant Rushton|Tarrant Rushton]] and remained airborne for 12 hours and 3 minutes, receiving {{convert|2352|impgal|L}} of fuel in ten refuelings from a Lancaster tanker.

In March 1948, the USAF purchased two sets of FRL's looped-hose in-flight refueling equipment, which had been in practical use with [[British Overseas Airways Corporation]] (BOAC) since 1946, and manufacturing rights to the system. FRL also provided a year of technical assistance. The sets were immediately installed in two [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress]]es, with plans to equip 80 B-29s.\n\nFlight testing began in May 1948 at [[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base]], [[Ohio]], and was so successful that in June orders went out to equip all new B-50s and subsequent bombers with receiving equipment. Two dedicated air refueling units were formed on June 30, 1948: the [[43d Air Refueling Squadron]] at [[Davis-Monthan Air Force Base]], [[Arizona]], and the [[509th Weapons Squadron|509th Air Refueling Squadron]] at [[Walker Air Force Base]], [[New Mexico]]. The first ARS aircraft used FRL's looped-hose refueling system, but testing with a boom system followed quickly in the autumn of 1948.\n\nThe first use of aerial refueling in combat took place during the Korean War, involving F-84 fighter-bombers flying missions from Japanese airfields, due to Chinese-North Korean forces overrunning many of the bases for jet aircraft in South Korea, refueling from converted B-29s using the drogue-and-probe in-flight refueling system with the probe located in one of the F-84's wing-tip fuel tanks.\n\n==Systems==\n{{More citations needed section|date=April 2012}}\n===Flying boom===\n\nThe flying boom is a rigid, telescoping tube with movable [[flight control surfaces]] that a [[boom operator (US military)|boom operator]] on the tanker aircraft extends and inserts into a receptacle on the receiving aircraft. All boom-equipped tankers (e.g. [[KC-135 Stratotanker]], [[KC-10 Extender]], [[KC-46 Pegasus]]) have a single boom, and can refuel one aircraft at a time with this mechanism.\n\n====History====\nIn the late 1940s, General [[Curtis LeMay]], commander of the [[Strategic Air Command]] (SAC), asked [[Boeing]] to develop a refueling system that could transfer fuel at a higher rate than had been possible with earlier systems using flexible hoses, resulting in the flying boom system.  The B-29 was the first to employ the boom, and between 1950 and 1951, 116 original B-29s, designated KB-29Ps, were converted at the Boeing plant at [[Renton, Washington]]. Boeing went on to develop the world's first production aerial tanker, the [[KC-97 Stratofreighter]], a piston-engined [[Boeing 377|Boeing Stratocruiser]] (USAF designation [[C-97 Stratofreighter]]) with a Boeing-developed flying boom and extra kerosene (jet fuel) tanks feeding the boom. The Stratocruiser airliner itself was developed from the B-29 bomber after [[World War II]]. In the KC-97, the mixed gasoline/kerosene fuel system was clearly not desirable and it was obvious that a jet-powered tanker aircraft would be the next development, having a single type of fuel for both its own engines and for passing to receiver aircraft. The 230&nbsp;mph (370&nbsp;km/h) cruise speed of the slower, piston-engined KC-97 was also a serious issue, as using it as an aerial tanker forced the newer jet-powered military aircraft to slow down to mate with the tanker's boom, a highly serious issue with the newer supersonic aircraft coming into service at that time, which could force such receiving aircraft in some situations to slow down enough to approach their [[stall speed]] during the approach to the tanker. It was no surprise that, after the KC-97, Boeing began receiving contracts from the USAF to build jet tankers based on the [[Boeing 367-80]] (Dash-80) airframe. The result was the [[Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker]], of which 732 were built.\n\nThe flying boom is attached to the rear of the tanker aircraft. The attachment is [[gimbal]]led, allowing the boom to move with the receiver aircraft. The boom contains a rigid pipe to transfer fuel. The fuel pipe ends in a nozzle with a flexible ball joint. The nozzle mates to the \"receptacle\" in the receiver aircraft during fuel transfer. A [[poppet valve]] in the end of the nozzle prevents fuel from exiting the tube until the nozzle properly mates with the receiver's refueling receptacle. Once properly mated, [[Toggle mechanism|toggles]] in the receptacle engage the nozzle, holding it locked during fuel transfer.\n\nThe \"flying\" boom is so named because [[flight control surfaces]], small movable [[airfoils]] that are often in a [[V-tail]] configuration, are used to move the boom by creating aerodynamic forces. They are actuated [[hydraulics|hydraulically]] and controlled by the [[boom operator (US military)|boom operator]] using a control stick. The boom operator also telescopes the boom to make the connection with the receiver's receptacle.\n\nTo complete an aerial refueling, the tanker and receiver aircraft rendezvous, flying in formation. The receiver moves to a position behind the tanker, within safe limits of travel for the boom, aided by director lights or directions radioed by the boom operator. Once in position, the operator extends the boom to make contact with the receiver aircraft. Once in contact, fuel is pumped through the boom into the receiver aircraft.\n[[File:KC-135Boom-operator-521.jpg|thumb|[[USAF]] [[KC-135]] [[Boom operator (military)|boom operator]] view from the boom pod.]]\nWhile in contact, the receiver pilot must continue to fly within the \"air refueling envelope\", the area in which contact with the boom is safe. Moving outside of this envelope can damage the boom or lead to mid-air collision, for example the [[1966 Palomares B-52 crash]]. If the receiving aircraft approaches the outer limits of the envelope, the boom operator will command the receiver pilot to correct his position and disconnect the boom if necessary.\n\nWhen the desired amount of fuel has been transferred, the two aircraft disconnect and the receiver aircraft departs the formation. When not in use, the boom is stored flush with the bottom of the tanker's fuselage to minimize drag.\n\nThe US Air Force fixed-wing aircraft use the flying boom system, along with countries operating F-16 or F-15 variants. The system is used by Australia (KC-30A), the Netherlands (KDC-10), Israel (modified Boeing 707), Turkey (KC-135Rs), and Iran (Boeing 747). The system allows higher fuel flow rates (up to {{convert|1000|USgal|l}} / {{convert|6500|lb|kg}} per minute for the KC-135, but does require a boom operator, and can only refuel one aircraft at a time.\n\n===Probe-and-drogue===\nThe probe-and-drogue refueling method employs a flexible hose that trails from the tanker aircraft. The ''drogue'' (or ''para-drogue''), sometimes called a ''basket'', is a fitting resembling a [[shuttlecock]], attached at its narrow end (like the \"cork\" nose of a shuttlecock) with a valve to a flexible hose. The drogue stabilizes the hose in flight and provides a funnel to aid insertion of the receiver aircraft probe into the hose. The hose connects to a Hose Drum Unit (HDU). When not in use, the hose/drogue is reeled completely into the HDU. The receiver has a ''probe'', which is a rigid, protruding or pivoted retractable arm placed on the aircraft's nose or fuselage to make the connection.  Most modern versions of the probe are usually designed to be retractable, and are retracted when not in use, particularly on high speed aircraft.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\nAt the end of the probe is a valve that is closed until it mates with the drogue's forward internal receptacle, after which it opens and allows fuel to pass from tanker to receiver. The valves in the probe and drogue that are most commonly used are to a [[NATO]] standard and were originally developed by the company [[Cobham plc|Flight Refuelling Limited]] in the UK and deployed in the late 1940s and 1950s.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} This standardization allows drogue-equipped tanker aircraft from many nations the ability to refuel probe-equipped aircraft from other nations. The NATO standard probe system incorporates shear rivets that attach the refueling valve to the end of the probe.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} This is so that if a large side or vertical load develops while in contact with the drogue, the rivets shear and the fuel valve breaks off, rather than the probe or receiver aircraft suffering structural damage. A so-called \"broken probe\" (actually a broken fuel valve, as described above) may happen if poor flying technique is used by the receiver pilot, or in turbulence. Sometimes the valve is retained in the tanker drogue and prevents further refueling from that drogue until removed during ground maintenance.\n\n;{{visible anchor|Buddy store}}\nA \"buddy store\" or \"buddy pod\" is an external pod loaded on an aircraft [[hardpoint]] that contains a hose and drogue system (HDU).<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite book |author=Naval Air Systems Command |title=A1-F18AC-NFM-000 Naval Aviation Training and Operating Procedures Standardization (NATOPS) Manual |publisher=United States [[Department of the Navy]] |date=1 August 2006 |page=364}}</ref> Buddy stores allow fighter{{\\}}bomber aircraft to be reconfigured for \"buddy tanking\" other aircraft. This allows an air combat force without dedicated/specialized tanker support (for instance, a [[carrier air wing]]) to extend the range of its strike aircraft. In other cases, using the buddy store method allows a [[Aircraft carrier|carrier]]-based aircraft to take-off with a heavier than usual load, the aircraft then being topped-up with fuel from a HDU-equipped \"buddy\" tanker, a method previously used by the [[Royal Navy]] in operating its [[Supermarine Scimitar]], [[de Havilland Sea Vixen]] and [[Blackburn Buccaneer]]s, in the Buccaneer's case using a bomb-bay-mounted tank and HDU.\n\n[[File:US Navy 110610-N-KA046-002 Two MH-53E Super Stallion helicopters assigned to Marine Medium Tiltrotor Squadron (VMM) 263 (Reinforced), 22nd Marine E (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|A [[Lockheed Martin KC-130|KC-130 Hercules]] refuels a pair of [[Sikorsky CH-53E Super Stallion|CH-53E Super Stallion]]'s ]]\nThe tanker aircraft flies straight and level and extends the hose/drogue which is allowed to trail out behind and below the tanker under normal aerodynamic forces. The pilot of the receiver aircraft extends the probe (if required) and uses normal flight controls to \"fly\" the refueling probe directly into the basket. This requires a closure rate of approximately two knots (walking speed) in order to establish solid probe/drogue coupling and push the hose several feet into the HDU. Too little closure will cause an incomplete connection and no fuel flow (or occasionally leaking fuel). Too much closure is dangerous because it can trigger a strong transverse [[oscillation]] in the hose, severing the probe tip. Another significant danger is that the drogue may hit the recipient aircraft and damage it\u2014instances have occurred in which the drogue has shattered the canopy of a fighter aircraft, causing great danger to its pilot.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\nThe optimal approach is from behind and below (not level with) the drogue. Because the drogue is relatively light (typically soft canvas webbing) and subject to aerodynamic forces, it can be pushed around by the bow wave of approaching aircraft, exacerbating engagement even in smooth air. After initial contact, the hose and drogue is pushed forward by the receiver a certain distance (typically, a few feet), and the hose is reeled slowly back onto its drum in the HDU. This opens the tanker's main refueling valve allowing fuel to flow to the drogue under the appropriate pressure (assuming the tanker crew has energized the pump). Tension on the hose is aerodynamically 'balanced' by a motor in the HDU so that as the receiver aircraft moves fore and aft, the hose retracts and extends, thus preventing bends in the hose that would cause undue side loads on the probe.  Fuel flow is typically indicated by illumination of a green light near the HDU. If the hose is pushed in too far or not far enough, a cutoff switch will inhibit fuel flow, which is typically accompanied by an amber light.  Disengagement is commanded by the tanker pilot with a red light.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\n[[List of United States naval aircraft | U.S. Navy]], [[United States Marine Corps Aviation |Marine Corps]], and some [[List of equipment of the United States Army#Aircraft|Army]] aircraft refuel using the \"hose-and-drogue\" system, as well as most Western-European aircraft.

[[Marck R. Cobb]], \"Aerial Refueling: The Need for a Multipoint, Dual-System Capability,\" AU-ARI-CP-87-3, Air University Press, July 1987.</ref>\n\n===Boom drogue adapter units===\nUSAF KC-135 and [[French Air Force]] KC-135FR refueling-boom equipped tankers can be field converted to a probe-and-drogue system using a special adapter unit. In this configuration, the tanker retains its articulated boom, but has a hose/drogue at the end of it instead of the usual nozzle. The tanker boom operator holds the boom in a static position, while the receiver aircraft then flies the probe into the basket. Unlike the soft canvas basket used in most drogue systems, the adapter units use a steel basket, grimly known as the \"iron maiden\" by [[naval aviator]]s because of its unforgiving nature. Soft drogues can be contacted slightly off center, wherein the probe is guided into the hose receptacle by the canvas drogue. The metal drogue, when contacted even slightly off center, will pivot out of place, potentially \"slapping\" the aircraft's fuselage and causing damage.\n\nThe other major difference with this system is that when contacted, the hose does not \"retract\" into an HDU. Instead, the hose bends depending on how far it is pushed toward the boom. If it is pushed too far, it can loop around the probe or nose of the aircraft, damage the windscreen, or cause contact with the rigid boom. If not pushed far enough, the probe will disengage, halting fueling. Because of a much smaller position keeping tolerance, staying properly connected to a KC-135 adapter unit is considerably more difficult than staying in a traditional hose/drogue configuration. When fueling is complete, the receiver carefully backs off until the probe refueling valve disconnects from the valve in the basket. Off center disengagements, like engagements, can cause the drogue to \"prang\" the probe and/or strike the aircraft's fuselage.\n\n===Multiple systems===\n[[File:KC-10 Extender with the 76th Air Refueling Squadron.jpg|thumb|A KC-10 Extender]]\nSome tankers have both a boom and one or more complete hose-and-drogue systems. The USAF [[KC-10]] has both a flying boom and also a separate hose and drogue system manufactured by Cobham plc. Both are on the aircraft centerline at the tail of the aircraft, so only one system can be used at once. However, such a system allows all types of probe- and receptacle-equipped aircraft to be refueled in a single mission, without landing to install an adapter. Many KC-135s and some KC-10s are also equipped with dual under-wing hose-and-drogue attachments known as [[Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker#Further upgrades and derivatives|Multi-point Refueling System]] (MPRSs) or Wing Air Refueling Pods (WARPs), respectively.\n\n===Wing-to-wing===\nIn this method, similar to the probe-and-drogue method but more complicated, the tanker aircraft released a flexible hose from its wingtip. An aircraft, flying beside it, had to catch the hose with a special lock under its wingtip. After the hose was locked, and the connection was established, the fuel was pumped. It was used on a small number of Soviet [[Tu-4]] and [[Tu-16]] only (the tanker variant was Tu-16Z).<ref>note&nbsp;\u2014 even today there is much confusion about how this system actually worked</ref>\n\n===Simple grappling===\nSome historic systems used for pioneering aerial refueling used the grappling method, where the tanker aircraft unreeled the fuel hose and the receiver aircraft would grapple the hose midair, reel it in and connect it so that fuel can be transferred either with the assistance of pumps or simply by [[siphon|gravity feed]]. This was the method used on the [[Question Mark (airplane)|Question Mark]] endurance flight in 1929.\n\n==Compatibility issues==\nThe probe-and-drogue system is not compatible with flying boom equipment, creating a problem for military planners where mixed forces are involved.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{Cite journal|last=Christopher|first=Bolkcom|last2=D.|first2=Klaus, Jon|date=2005-05-11|title=Air Force Aerial Refueling Methods: Flying Boom versus Hose-and-Drogue|url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/govdocs/crs/permalink/meta-crs-6702:1|journal=Digital Library|language=English}}</ref> Incompatibility can also complicate the procurement of new systems&nbsp;\u2014 the Royal Canadian Air Force currently wish to purchase the [[Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II#F-35A|F-35A]], which can only refuel via the flying boom, but only possess [[CC-150|probe-and-drogue refuelers]]. The potential cost of converting F-35As to probe-and-drogue refueling (as is used on U.S. Navy & Marine Corps [[Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II#F-35B|F-35B]]s and [[Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II#F-35C|F-35C]]s) has added to the political controversy which already surrounds F-35 procurement within the RCAF.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.macleans.ca/general/canadian-military-unable-to-refuel-new-jets-in-mid-air/ |title= Canadian military unable to refuel new jets in mid-air |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=31 Jan 2011 |website=Macleans.ca |publisher= |access-date=13 June 2015 |quote=}}</ref>\n\nThese concerns can be addressed by drogue adapters (see section \"Boom drogue adapter units\" above) that allow drogue aircraft to refuel from boom-equipped aircraft, and by refuelers which are equipped with both drogue and boom units and can thus refuel both types in the same flight, such as the KC-10, MPRS KC-135, or Airbus A330 MRTT.\n\n===Strategic===\n[[File:A KC-135 Stratotanker from the 127th Air Refueling Group performs a night time refueling for a C-17 Globemaster III.jpg|\nthumb|left|A [[C-17 Globemaster III]] receives fuel from a KC-135, at night]] \nThe development of the [[Boeing KC-97 Stratofreighter|KC-97]] and [[Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker]]s was pushed by the [[Cold War]] requirement of the [[United States]] to be able to keep fleets of [[nuclear bomb|nuclear]]-armed [[B-47 Stratojet]] and [[B-52 Stratofortress]] [[strategic bombers]] airborne around-the-clock either to threaten retaliation against a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] strike for [[mutual assured destruction]], or to bomb the U.S.S.R. first had it been ordered to do so by the [[President of the United States]]. The bombers would fly orbits around their assigned positions from which they were to enter Soviet airspace if they received the order, and the tankers would refill the bombers' fuel tanks so that they could keep a force in the air 24 hours a day, and still have enough fuel to reach their targets in the Soviet Union. This also ensured that a [[first strike]] against the bombers' [[airfield]]s could not obliterate the U.S.'s ability to retaliate by bomber.\n\nIn 1958, Valiant tankers in the UK were developed with one HDU mounted in the bomb-bay. Valiant tankers of 214 Squadron were used to demonstrate radius of action by refueling a Valiant bomber non-stop from UK to Singapore in 1960 and a Vulcan bomber to Australia in 1961. Other UK exercises involving refueling aircraft from Valiant tankers included [[Gloster Javelin|Javelin]] and [[English Electric Lightning|Lightning]] fighters, also Vulcan and Victor bombers. For instance, in 1962 a squadron of Javelin air defense aircraft was refueled in stages from the UK to [[India]] and back (exercise \"Shiksha\"). After the retirement of the Valiant in 1965, the Handley Page Victor took over the UK refueling role and had three hoses (HDUs).  These were a fuselage-mounted HDU and a refueling pod on each wing. The center hose could refuel any probe-equipped aircraft, the wing pods could refuel the more maneuverable fighter/ground attack types.\n\nA byproduct of this development effort and the building of large numbers of tankers was that these tankers were also available to refuel [[cargo aircraft]], [[fighter aircraft]], and [[ground attack aircraft]], in addition to bombers, for ferrying to distant theaters of operations. This was much used during the [[Vietnam War]], when many aircraft could not have covered the transoceanic distances without aerial refueling, even with intermediate bases in [[Hawaii]] and [[Okinawa]]. In addition to allowing the transport of the aircraft themselves, the cargo aircraft could also carry [[mat\u00e9riel]], supplies, and personnel to [[Vietnam]] without landing to refuel. KC-135s were also frequently used for refueling of air combat missions from air bases in Thailand.\n\nThe USAF [[SR-71 Blackbird]] strategic reconnaissance aircraft made frequent use of air-to-air refueling. Indeed, design considerations of the aircraft made its mission impossible without aerial refueling. Based at [[Beale AFB]] in central [[California]], SR-71s had to be forward deployed to Europe and Japan prior to flying actual reconnaissance missions. These trans-Pacific and trans-Atlantic flights during deployment were impossible without aerial refueling. The SR-71's designers traded takeoff performance for better high-speed, high-altitude performance, necessitating takeoff with less-than-full fuel tanks from even the longest runways. Once airborne, the Blackbird would accelerate to supersonic speed using afterburners to facilitate structural heating and expansion. The magnitude of temperature changes experienced by the SR-71, from parked to its maximum speed, resulted in significant expansion of its structural parts in cruise flight. To allow for the expansion, the Blackbird's parts had to fit loosely when cold, so loosely, in fact, that the Blackbird constantly leaked fuel before heating expanded the airframe enough to seal its fuel tanks. Following the supersonic dash, and to stop the fuel leaks, the SR-71 would then rendezvous with a tanker to fill its now nearly empty tanks before proceeding on its mission. This was referred to as the ''LTTR'' (for \"Launch To Tanker Rendezvous\") profile. LTTR had the added advantage of providing an operational test of the Blackbird's refueling capability within minutes after takeoff, enabling a Return-To-Launch-Site abort capability if necessary. At its most efficient altitude and speed, the Blackbird was capable of flying for many hours without refueling. The SR-71 used a special fuel, [[JP-7]], with a very high [[flash point]] to withstand the extreme skin temperatures generated during Mach 3+ cruise flight.<ref name=SR-71.org>{{cite web|title=Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird|url=http://www.sr-71.org/blackbird/sr-71/|accessdate=8 February 2014}}</ref>  While JP-7 could be used by other aircraft, its burn characteristics posed problems in certain situations (such as high-altitude, emergency engine starts) that made it less than optimal for aircraft other than the SR-71.\n\nNormally, all the fuel aboard a tanker aircraft may be either offloaded, or burned by the tanker as necessary. To make this possible, the KC-135 fuel system incorporated gravity draining and pumps to allow moving fuel from tank to tank depending on mission needs. Mixing JP-7 with JP-4 or Jet A, however, rendered it unsuitable for use by the SR-71, so the US Air Force commissioned a specially modified KC-135 variant, the [[KC-135#Variants|KC-135Q]], which included changes to the fuel system and operating procedures preventing inadvertent inflight mixing of fuel intended for offload with fuel intended for use by the tanker. SR-71 aircraft were refueled exclusively by KC-135Q tankers.\n\nThe French strategic [[Force de dissuasion]] or Force de frappe strategic nuclear deterrent force uses KC-135 tankers to refuel and extend the range of [[Dassault Mirage 2000N/2000D|Mirage 2000N]] fighter-bombers and, before their retirement, [[Dassault Mirage IV]] supersonic bombers which were sometimes planned to operate in pairs, one armed, and one carrying a buddy pack air refueling pod.\n[[File:Refuelling a Sukhoi Su-34 (cropped).jpg|thumb|A [[Russian Air Force]] [[Sukhoi Su-34]] takes on fuel through a Probe-and-drogue system]]\nIsrael has a fleet of Boeing 707s equipped with a boom refueling system similar to the KC-135, used to refuel and extend the range of fighter bombers such as the F-15I and F-16I for deterrent and strike missions.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JW1lHcbIXYM|title=\u05ea\u05d3\u05dc\u05d5\u05e7 \u05d0\u05d5\u05d5\u05d9\u05e8\u05d9|last=Israeli Air Force|date=10 October 2013|publisher=|accessdate=19 November 2016|via=YouTube}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.defensemedianetwork.com/stories/first-strike-on-irans-nuclear-facilities-part-1/|title=Israel's First Strike on Iran's Nuclear Facilities \u2013 Part 1 - Defense Media Network|publisher=|accessdate=19 November 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Tactical===\nTankers are considered \"force multipliers\", because they convey considerable tactical advantages. Primarily, aerial refueling adds to the combat radius of attack, fighter and bombers aircraft, and allows patrol aircraft to remain airborne longer, thereby reducing the numbers of aircraft necessary to accomplish a given mission. Aerial refueling can also mitigate basing issues which might otherwise place limitations on combat [[Payload (air and space craft)|payload]]. Combat aircraft operating from airfields with shorter runways must limit their takeoff weight, which could mean a choice between range (fuel) and combat payload (munitions). Aerial refueling, however, eliminates many of these basing difficulties because a combat aircraft can take off with a full combat payload and refuel immediately.\n\nAside from these issues, the psychological advantage of full fuel tanks&nbsp;\u2013 and a tanker likely available nearby&nbsp;\u2013 gives a pilot a distinct edge in combat. In most combat situations, speed is a necessity for optimal completion of the mission at hand.\nAs high speeds require fuel, pilots must always balance fuel and speed requirements. Pilots operating aircraft with aerial refueling capability eliminate low-fuel concerns.\n\n==Operational History== \n====Vietnam War====\n\nDuring the [[Vietnam War]], it was common for USAF fighter-bombers flying from [[Thailand]] to [[North Vietnam]] to refuel from KC-135s en route to their target. Besides extending their range, this enabled the [[F-105]]s and [[F-4 Phantom]]s to carry more bombs and rockets. Tankers were also available for refueling on the way back if necessary. In addition to ferrying aircraft across the [[Pacific Ocean]], aerial refueling made it possible for battle-damaged fighters, with heavily leaking fuel tanks, to hook up to the tankers and let the tanker feed its engine(s) until the point where they could glide to the base and land. This saved numerous aircraft. {{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\nThe US Navy frequently used carrier-based aerial tankers like the [[A-3 Skywarrior|KA-3 Skywarrior]] to refuel Navy and Marine aircraft such as the F-4, [[A-4 Skyhawk]], [[A-6 Intruder]], and [[A-7 Corsair II]]. This was particularly useful when a pilot returning from an airstrike was having difficulty landing and was running low on [[jet fuel]]. This gave him fuel for more attempts at landing for a successful \"trap\" on an aircraft carrier. The KA-3 could also refuel fighters on extended Combat Air Patrol. USMC jets based in South Vietnam and Thailand also used USMC [[KC-130]] Hercules transports for air-to-air refueling on missions.\n[[File:HC-130P refuels HH-3E over Southeast Asia (cropped).jpg|thumb|HC-130P refuels HH-3E over Southeast Asia ]]\n====Middle East====\nDuring the 1980s [[Iran\u2013Iraq War]], the Iranian Air Force maintained at least one KC 707-3J9C aerial tanker, which the Islamic Republic had inherited from the Shah's government. This was used most effectively on April 4, 1981, refueling eight IRIAF F-4 Phantoms on long-range sorties into Iraq to [[H-3 airstrike|bomb the H-3 Al Walid airfield]] near the Jordanian border.<ref>Air Forces Monthly Special ''F-4 Phantom'' {{ISBN|0-946219-46-X}}  article by Farzin Nadimi p77</ref>. In 1985, Israeli [[F-15]]s used heavily modified [[Boeing 707]] aircraft to provide aerial refueling over the [[Mediterranean Sea]] in order to extend their range for the 2,000&nbsp;km flight during the [[Operation Wooden Leg]] air raid on the headquarters of the [[Palestine Liberation Organization|PLO]] near [[Tunis]], [[Tunisia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/israel/iaf.htm|title=Israel Air Force - Israel|first=John|last=Pike|publisher=|accessdate=19 November 2016}}</ref>\n\n====Falklands War====\nDuring the [[Falklands War]], aerial refueling played a vital role in all of the successful Argentine attacks against the [[Royal Navy]]. The [[Argentine Air Force]] had only two KC-130H Hercules available and they were used to refuel both Air Force and Navy [[A-4 Skyhawk]]s and Navy [[Super Etendard]]s in their [[Exocet]] strikes. The Hercules on several occasions approached the islands (where the [[Sea Harrier]]s were in patrol) to search and guide the A-4s in their returning flights. On one of those flights (callsign ''Jaguar'') one of the KC-130s went to rescue a damaged A-4 and delivered {{convert|39000|lb|abbr=on}} of fuel while carrying it to its airfield at [[Puerto San Juli\u00e1n|San Julian]]. However, the [[Mirage III]]s and [[IAI Nesher|Daggers]] lack of air refueling capability prevented them from achieving better results. The Mirages were unable to reach the islands with a strike payload, and the Daggers could do so only for a five-minute strike flight.\n\nOn the British side, air refueling was carried out by the [[Handley Page Victor]] K.2 and, after the Argentine surrender, by modified C-130 Hercules tankers. These aircraft aided deployments from the UK to the [[Ascension Island]] staging post in the Atlantic and further deployments south of bomber, transport and maritime patrol aircraft. The most famous refueling missions were the 8,000&nbsp;nmi (15,000&nbsp;km) \"[[Operation Black Buck]]\" sorties which used 14 Victor tankers to allow an [[Avro Vulcan]] bomber (with a flying reserve bomber) to attack the Argentine-captured airfield at Port Stanley on the [[Falkland Islands]]. With all the aircraft flying from Ascension, the tankers themselves needed refueling. The raids were the longest-range bombing raids in history until surpassed by the [[Boeing B-52]]s flying from the States to bomb Iraq in the 1991 [[Gulf War]] and later [[B-2 Spirit|B-2]] flights.\n\n====Gulf War====\nDuring the time of Operation Desert Shield, the military buildup to the Persian Gulf War, US Air Force Boeing KC-135s & McDonnell Douglas KC-10As, and USMC KC-130 Hercules aircraft were deployed to forward air bases in [[England]], [[Diego Garcia]], and [[Saudi Arabia]]. Aircraft stationed in Saudi Arabia normally maintained an orbit in the [[Saudi\u2013Iraqi neutral zone]], informally known as \"Frisbee\", and refueled coalition aircraft whenever necessary. Two side by side tracks over central Saudi Arabia called \"Prune\" and \"Raisin\" featured 2\u20134 basket equipped KC-135 tankers each and were used by Navy aircraft from the [[Red Sea Battle Force]]. Large Navy strike groups from the Red Sea would send A-6 tankers to the Prune and Raisin tracks ahead of the strike aircraft arriving to top off and take up station to the right of the Air Force tankers thereby providing an additional tanking point. RAF Handley Page Victor and [[Vickers VC10]] tankers were also used to refuel British and coalition aircraft and were popular with the US Navy for their docile basket behavior and having three point refueling stations. An additional track was maintained close to the northwest border for the E-3 AWACS aircraft and any Navy aircraft needing emergency fuel. These 24-hour air-refueling zones helped make the intense air campaign during Operation Desert Storm possible. An additional 24/7 tanker presence was maintained over the Red Sea itself to refuel Navy F-14 Tomcats maintaining [[Combat Air Patrol]] tracks. During the last week of the conflict, KC-10 tankers moved inside Iraq to support barrier CAP missions set up to block Iraqi fighters from escaping to Iran.\n[[File:Exercise Angel Thunder 2014 140512-F-IE715-1625.jpg|thumb|left|A [[French Air Force]] [[Eurocopter EC725|EC725]] is refueled by a [[Lockheed HC-130]] during Exercise Angel Thunder]]\nOn January 16\u201317, 1991, the first combat sortie of Operation Desert Storm, and the longest combat sortie in history, at that time, was launched from [[Barksdale AFB, Louisiana]]. Seven B-52Gs flew a thirty-five-hour mission to the [[Persian Gulf]] region, and back, to launch Boeing Air Launched Cruise Missiles (ALCMs) with the surprise use of conventional warheads. All of this was made possible by in-flight refueling, and by the secret switch away from nuclear warheads on the ALCMs.\n\nAn extremely useful aerial tanker in Desert Storm was the USAF KC-10A Extender. Besides being larger than the other tankers, the KC-10A is equipped with the USAF \"boom\" refueling and also the \"hose-and-drogue\" system. This makes it possible for the KC-10A to refuel USAF aircraft, and also USMC and US Navy jets that use the \"probe-and-drogue\" system, and also allied aircraft, such as those from the UK and Saudi Arabia. KC-135s may be equipped with a drogue depending on the mission profile.\n\nThe KC-10A was originally designed for the support of NATO in Europe by the USAF. In the case of armed conflict, with a full jet fuel load, the KC-10A is capable of flying from a base on the east coast of the US or Canada, flying nonstop to Europe, transferring a considerable amount of fuel in air-to-air refueling, and then returning to its home base, all without landing anywhere. This could have been very useful in the Cold War era when numerous European bases would (probably) have been disabled by Warsaw Pact strikes in [[Germany]], [[Italy]], the [[Netherlands]], [[France]], and the [[United Kingdom]].\n\n===Helicopters===\nHelicopter In-Flight Refueling (HIFR) is a variation of aerial refueling when a naval [[helicopter]] approaches a warship (not necessarily suited for landing operations) and receives fuel through the cabin while hovering.  Alternatively, some helicopters equipped with a probe extending out the front can be refueled from a drogue-equipped tanker aircraft in a similar manner to fixed-wing aircraft by matching a high forward speed for a helicopter to a slow speed for the fixed-wing tanker.\n\n==Longest manned flight record==\nA mission modified [[Cessna 172 Skyhawk]] with a crew of two set the world record for the longest continuous manned flight without landing of 64 days, 22 hours, 19 minutes, and five seconds in 1958 by refueling and transferring food and supplies from a [[convertible]] top [[Ford Thunderbird]] automobile. The publicity flight for a Las Vegas area hotel ended when the aircraft's performance had degraded to the point where the Cessna had difficulty climbing away from the refueling car.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://untoldvalor.blogspot.co.il/2008/07/plane-that-flew-for-62-days-and-t-bird.html|title=The Plane that Flew for 62 Days and the T-Bird that Saved the Day|publisher=|accessdate=19 November 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aopa.org/News-and-Video/All-News/2008/March/1/Endurance-Test-Circa-1958|title=Endurance Test, Circa 1958|date=3 January 2008|publisher=|accessdate=19 November 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Developments==\n\n* Commercial tankers are occasionally used by military forces.

A series of air refuelings can give range limited only by crew fatigue and engineering factors such as engine oil consumption. Because the receiver aircraft can be topped up with extra fuel in the air, air refueling can allow a [[takeoff]] with a greater [[Payload (air and space craft)|payload]] which could be weapons, cargo, or personnel: the [[maximum takeoff weight]] is maintained by carrying less fuel and topping up once airborne. Alternatively, a shorter take-off roll can be achieved because take-off can be at a lighter weight before refueling once airborne. Aerial refueling has also been considered as a means to reduce fuel consumption on long-distance flights greater than {{convert|3000|nmi}}. Potential fuel savings in the range of 35\u201340% have been estimated for long-haul flights (including the fuel used during the tanker missions).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Nangia |first=R.K |title=Operations and aircraft design towards greener civil aviation using air-to-air refuelling |journal=The Aeronautical Journal |date=November 2006 |volume=Paper No. 3088. |issue=November |pages=705\u2013721 |url=http://www.greenerbydesign.org.uk/_FILES/publications/3088.pdf |accessdate=20 October 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021064242/http://www.greenerbydesign.org.uk/_FILES/publications/3088.pdf |archivedate=21 October 2013 }}</ref>\n\nUsually, the aircraft providing the fuel is specially designed for the task, although refueling pods can be fitted to existing aircraft designs if the \"probe-and-drogue\" system is to be used.  The cost of the refueling equipment on both tanker and receiver aircraft and the specialized aircraft handling of the aircraft to be refueled (very close \"line astern\" formation flying) has resulted in the activity only being used in military operations. There is no known regular civilian in-flight refueling activity. Originally employed shortly before [[World War II]] on a very limited scale to extend the range of British civilian transatlantic [[flying boat]]s, and then after World War II on a large scale to extend the range of [[strategic bomber]]s, aerial refueling since the [[Vietnam War]] has been extensively used in large-scale military operations. For instance, in the [[Gulf War]] and the Iraqi [[invasion of Kuwait]] and the [[Iraq War]], all coalition air sorties were air-refueled except for a few short-range ground attack sorties in the Kuwait area.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n\n==History and development==\n\n===Early experiments===\n[[File:Refueling, 1923.jpg|thumb|left|[[Captain (land)|Capt.]] [[Lowell Smith]] and Lt. John P. Richter receiving the first mid-air refueling on June 27, 1923]]\nSome of the earliest experiments in aerial refueling took place in the 1920s; two slow-flying aircraft flew in formation, with a hose run down from a hand-held fuel tank on one aircraft and placed into the usual fuel filler of the other. The first mid-air refueling, based on the development of [[Alexander P. de Seversky]], between two planes occurred on June 27, 1923, between two [[Airco DH-4B]] [[biplane]]s of the [[United States Army Air Service]]. An endurance record was set by three DH-4Bs (a receiver and two tankers) on August 27\u201328, 1923, in which the receiver airplane remained aloft for more than 37 hours using nine mid-air refuelings to transfer {{convert|687|usgal|L}} of [[aviation gasoline]] and {{convert|38|usgal|L}} of engine oil. The same crews demonstrated the utility of the technique on October 25, 1923, when a DH-4 flew from [[Sumas, Washington]], on the [[Canada\u2013United States border]], to [[Tijuana, Mexico]], landing in [[San Diego]], using mid-air refuelings at [[Eugene, Oregon]], and [[Sacramento, California]].\n\nSimilar trial demonstrations of mid-air refueling technique took place at the [[Royal Aircraft Establishment]] in [[England]] and by the [[Arm\u00e9e de l'Air]] in [[France]] in the same year, but these early experiments were not yet regarded as a practical proposition, and were generally dismissed as stunts.\n\nAs the 1920s progressed, greater numbers of aviation enthusiasts vied to set new aerial long-distance records, using inflight air refueling. One such enthusiast, who would revolutionize aerial refueling was Sir [[Alan Cobham]], member of the [[Royal Flying Corps]] in [[World War I]], and a pioneer of long-distance aviation. During the 1920s, he made long-distance flights to places as far afield as [[Africa]] and [[Australia]] and he began experimenting with the possibilities of in-flight refueling to extend the range of flight.<ref>Colin Cruddas, ''Highways to the Empire'' (Air Britain, 2006, {{ISBN|0-85130-376-5}}); G.H.

This craft was eventually modified by Airspeed to Cobham's specification, for a non-stop flight from [[London]] to [[India]], using in-flight refueling to extend the plane's flight duration.\n\nMeanwhile, in 1929, a group of [[United States Army Air Corps|U.S. Army Air Corps]] fliers, led by then Major [[Carl Andrew Spaatz|Carl Spaatz]], set an endurance record of over 150 hours with the [[Question Mark (airplane)|''Question Mark'']] over Los Angeles.  Between June 11 and July 4, 1930, the brothers John, Kenneth, Albert, and Walter Hunter set a new record of 553 hours 40 minutes over Chicago using two [[Stinson Detroiter|Stinson SM-1 Detroiters]] as refueler and receiver. Aerial refueling remained a very dangerous process until 1935, when brothers [[The Flying Keys|Fred and Al Key]] demonstrated a spill-free refueling nozzle, designed by A. D. Hunter.<ref>There is no indication that any relationship exists between A.D.

In March 1948, the USAF purchased two sets of FRL's looped-hose in-flight refueling equipment, which had been in practical use with [[British Overseas Airways Corporation]] (BOAC) since 1946, and manufacturing rights to the system. FRL also provided a year of technical assistance. The sets were immediately installed in two [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress]]es, with plans to equip 80 B-29s.\n\nFlight testing began in May 1948 at [[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base]], [[Ohio]], and was so successful that in June orders went out to equip all new B-50s and subsequent bombers with receiving equipment. Two dedicated air refueling units were formed on June 30, 1948: the [[43d Air Refueling Squadron]] at [[Davis-Monthan Air Force Base]], [[Arizona]], and the [[509th Weapons Squadron|509th Air Refueling Squadron]] at [[Walker Air Force Base]], [[New Mexico]]. The first ARS aircraft used FRL's looped-hose refueling system, but testing with a boom system followed quickly in the autumn of 1948.\n\nThe first use of aerial refueling in combat took place during the Korean War, involving F-84 fighter-bombers flying missions from Japanese airfields, due to Chinese-North Korean forces overrunning many of the bases for jet aircraft in South Korea, refueling from converted B-29s using the drogue-and-probe in-flight refueling system with the probe located in one of the F-84's wing-tip fuel tanks.\n\n==Systems==\n{{More citations needed section|date=April 2012}}\n===Flying boom===\n\nThe flying boom is a rigid, telescoping tube with movable [[flight control surfaces]] that a [[boom operator (US military)|boom operator]] on the tanker aircraft extends and inserts into a receptacle on the receiving aircraft. All boom-equipped tankers (e.g. [[KC-135 Stratotanker]], [[KC-10 Extender]], [[KC-46 Pegasus]]) have a single boom, and can refuel one aircraft at a time with this mechanism.\n\n====History====\nIn the late 1940s, General [[Curtis LeMay]], commander of the [[Strategic Air Command]] (SAC), asked [[Boeing]] to develop a refueling system that could transfer fuel at a higher rate than had been possible with earlier systems using flexible hoses, resulting in the flying boom system.  The B-29 was the first to employ the boom, and between 1950 and 1951, 116 original B-29s, designated KB-29Ps, were converted at the Boeing plant at [[Renton, Washington]]. Boeing went on to develop the world's first production aerial tanker, the [[KC-97 Stratofreighter]], a piston-engined [[Boeing 377|Boeing Stratocruiser]] (USAF designation [[C-97 Stratofreighter]]) with a Boeing-developed flying boom and extra kerosene (jet fuel) tanks feeding the boom. The Stratocruiser airliner itself was developed from the B-29 bomber after [[World War II]]. In the KC-97, the mixed gasoline/kerosene fuel system was clearly not desirable and it was obvious that a jet-powered tanker aircraft would be the next development, having a single type of fuel for both its own engines and for passing to receiver aircraft. The 230&nbsp;mph (370&nbsp;km/h) cruise speed of the slower, piston-engined KC-97 was also a serious issue, as using it as an aerial tanker forced the newer jet-powered military aircraft to slow down to mate with the tanker's boom, a highly serious issue with the newer supersonic aircraft coming into service at that time, which could force such receiving aircraft in some situations to slow down enough to approach their [[stall speed]] during the approach to the tanker. It was no surprise that, after the KC-97, Boeing began receiving contracts from the USAF to build jet tankers based on the [[Boeing 367-80]] (Dash-80) airframe. The result was the [[Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker]], of which 732 were built.\n\nThe flying boom is attached to the rear of the tanker aircraft. The attachment is [[gimbal]]led, allowing the boom to move with the receiver aircraft. The boom contains a rigid pipe to transfer fuel. The fuel pipe ends in a nozzle with a flexible ball joint. The nozzle mates to the \"receptacle\" in the receiver aircraft during fuel transfer. A [[poppet valve]] in the end of the nozzle prevents fuel from exiting the tube until the nozzle properly mates with the receiver's refueling receptacle. Once properly mated, [[Toggle mechanism|toggles]] in the receptacle engage the nozzle, holding it locked during fuel transfer.\n\nThe \"flying\" boom is so named because [[flight control surfaces]], small movable [[airfoils]] that are often in a [[V-tail]] configuration, are used to move the boom by creating aerodynamic forces. They are actuated [[hydraulics|hydraulically]] and controlled by the [[boom operator (US military)|boom operator]] using a control stick. The boom operator also telescopes the boom to make the connection with the receiver's receptacle.\n\nTo complete an aerial refueling, the tanker and receiver aircraft rendezvous, flying in formation. The receiver moves to a position behind the tanker, within safe limits of travel for the boom, aided by director lights or directions radioed by the boom operator. Once in position, the operator extends the boom to make contact with the receiver aircraft. Once in contact, fuel is pumped through the boom into the receiver aircraft.\n[[File:KC-135Boom-operator-521.jpg|thumb|[[USAF]] [[KC-135]] [[Boom operator (military)|boom operator]] view from the boom pod.]]\nWhile in contact, the receiver pilot must continue to fly within the \"air refueling envelope\", the area in which contact with the boom is safe. Moving outside of this envelope can damage the boom or lead to mid-air collision, for example the [[1966 Palomares B-52 crash]]. If the receiving aircraft approaches the outer limits of the envelope, the boom operator will command the receiver pilot to correct his position and disconnect the boom if necessary.\n\nWhen the desired amount of fuel has been transferred, the two aircraft disconnect and the receiver aircraft departs the formation. When not in use, the boom is stored flush with the bottom of the tanker's fuselage to minimize drag.\n\nThe US Air Force fixed-wing aircraft use the flying boom system, along with countries operating F-16 or F-15 variants. The system is used by Australia (KC-30A), the Netherlands (KDC-10), Israel (modified Boeing 707), Turkey (KC-135Rs), and Iran (Boeing 747). The system allows higher fuel flow rates (up to {{convert|1000|USgal|l}} / {{convert|6500|lb|kg}} per minute for the KC-135, but does require a boom operator, and can only refuel one aircraft at a time.\n\n===Probe-and-drogue===\nThe probe-and-drogue refueling method employs a flexible hose that trails from the tanker aircraft. The ''drogue'' (or ''para-drogue''), sometimes called a ''basket'', is a fitting resembling a [[shuttlecock]], attached at its narrow end (like the \"cork\" nose of a shuttlecock) with a valve to a flexible hose. The drogue stabilizes the hose in flight and provides a funnel to aid insertion of the receiver aircraft probe into the hose. The hose connects to a Hose Drum Unit (HDU). When not in use, the hose/drogue is reeled completely into the HDU. The receiver has a ''probe'', which is a rigid, protruding or pivoted retractable arm placed on the aircraft's nose or fuselage to make the connection.  Most modern versions of the probe are usually designed to be retractable, and are retracted when not in use, particularly on high speed aircraft.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\nAt the end of the probe is a valve that is closed until it mates with the drogue's forward internal receptacle, after which it opens and allows fuel to pass from tanker to receiver. The valves in the probe and drogue that are most commonly used are to a [[NATO]] standard and were originally developed by the company [[Cobham plc|Flight Refuelling Limited]] in the UK and deployed in the late 1940s and 1950s.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} This standardization allows drogue-equipped tanker aircraft from many nations the ability to refuel probe-equipped aircraft from other nations. The NATO standard probe system incorporates shear rivets that attach the refueling valve to the end of the probe.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} This is so that if a large side or vertical load develops while in contact with the drogue, the rivets shear and the fuel valve breaks off, rather than the probe or receiver aircraft suffering structural damage. A so-called \"broken probe\" (actually a broken fuel valve, as described above) may happen if poor flying technique is used by the receiver pilot, or in turbulence. Sometimes the valve is retained in the tanker drogue and prevents further refueling from that drogue until removed during ground maintenance.\n\n;{{visible anchor|Buddy store}}\nA \"buddy store\" or \"buddy pod\" is an external pod loaded on an aircraft [[hardpoint]] that contains a hose and drogue system (HDU).<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite book |author=Naval Air Systems Command |title=A1-F18AC-NFM-000 Naval Aviation Training and Operating Procedures Standardization (NATOPS) Manual |publisher=United States [[Department of the Navy]] |date=1 August 2006 |page=364}}</ref> Buddy stores allow fighter{{\\}}bomber aircraft to be reconfigured for \"buddy tanking\" other aircraft. This allows an air combat force without dedicated/specialized tanker support (for instance, a [[carrier air wing]]) to extend the range of its strike aircraft. In other cases, using the buddy store method allows a [[Aircraft carrier|carrier]]-based aircraft to take-off with a heavier than usual load, the aircraft then being topped-up with fuel from a HDU-equipped \"buddy\" tanker, a method previously used by the [[Royal Navy]] in operating its [[Supermarine Scimitar]], [[de Havilland Sea Vixen]] and [[Blackburn Buccaneer]]s, in the Buccaneer's case using a bomb-bay-mounted tank and HDU.\n\n[[File:US Navy 110610-N-KA046-002 Two MH-53E Super Stallion helicopters assigned to Marine Medium Tiltrotor Squadron (VMM) 263 (Reinforced), 22nd Marine E (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|A [[Lockheed Martin KC-130|KC-130 Hercules]] refuels a pair of [[Sikorsky CH-53E Super Stallion|CH-53E Super Stallion]]'s ]]\nThe tanker aircraft flies straight and level and extends the hose/drogue which is allowed to trail out behind and below the tanker under normal aerodynamic forces. The pilot of the receiver aircraft extends the probe (if required) and uses normal flight controls to \"fly\" the refueling probe directly into the basket. This requires a closure rate of approximately two knots (walking speed) in order to establish solid probe/drogue coupling and push the hose several feet into the HDU. Too little closure will cause an incomplete connection and no fuel flow (or occasionally leaking fuel). Too much closure is dangerous because it can trigger a strong transverse [[oscillation]] in the hose, severing the probe tip. Another significant danger is that the drogue may hit the recipient aircraft and damage it\u2014instances have occurred in which the drogue has shattered the canopy of a fighter aircraft, causing great danger to its pilot.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\nThe optimal approach is from behind and below (not level with) the drogue. Because the drogue is relatively light (typically soft canvas webbing) and subject to aerodynamic forces, it can be pushed around by the bow wave of approaching aircraft, exacerbating engagement even in smooth air. After initial contact, the hose and drogue is pushed forward by the receiver a certain distance (typically, a few feet), and the hose is reeled slowly back onto its drum in the HDU. This opens the tanker's main refueling valve allowing fuel to flow to the drogue under the appropriate pressure (assuming the tanker crew has energized the pump). Tension on the hose is aerodynamically 'balanced' by a motor in the HDU so that as the receiver aircraft moves fore and aft, the hose retracts and extends, thus preventing bends in the hose that would cause undue side loads on the probe.  Fuel flow is typically indicated by illumination of a green light near the HDU. If the hose is pushed in too far or not far enough, a cutoff switch will inhibit fuel flow, which is typically accompanied by an amber light.  Disengagement is commanded by the tanker pilot with a red light.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\n[[List of United States naval aircraft | U.S. Navy]], [[United States Marine Corps Aviation |Marine Corps]], and some [[List of equipment of the United States Army#Aircraft|Army]] aircraft refuel using the \"hose-and-drogue\" system, as well as most Western-European aircraft.

[[Marck R. Cobb]], \"Aerial Refueling: The Need for a Multipoint, Dual-System Capability,\" AU-ARI-CP-87-3, Air University Press, July 1987.</ref>\n\n===Boom drogue adapter units===\nUSAF KC-135 and [[French Air Force]] KC-135FR refueling-boom equipped tankers can be field converted to a probe-and-drogue system using a special adapter unit. In this configuration, the tanker retains its articulated boom, but has a hose/drogue at the end of it instead of the usual nozzle. The tanker boom operator holds the boom in a static position, while the receiver aircraft then flies the probe into the basket. Unlike the soft canvas basket used in most drogue systems, the adapter units use a steel basket, grimly known as the \"iron maiden\" by [[naval aviator]]s because of its unforgiving nature. Soft drogues can be contacted slightly off center, wherein the probe is guided into the hose receptacle by the canvas drogue. The metal drogue, when contacted even slightly off center, will pivot out of place, potentially \"slapping\" the aircraft's fuselage and causing damage.\n\nThe other major difference with this system is that when contacted, the hose does not \"retract\" into an HDU. Instead, the hose bends depending on how far it is pushed toward the boom. If it is pushed too far, it can loop around the probe or nose of the aircraft, damage the windscreen, or cause contact with the rigid boom. If not pushed far enough, the probe will disengage, halting fueling. Because of a much smaller position keeping tolerance, staying properly connected to a KC-135 adapter unit is considerably more difficult than staying in a traditional hose/drogue configuration. When fueling is complete, the receiver carefully backs off until the probe refueling valve disconnects from the valve in the basket. Off center disengagements, like engagements, can cause the drogue to \"prang\" the probe and/or strike the aircraft's fuselage.\n\n===Multiple systems===\n[[File:KC-10 Extender with the 76th Air Refueling Squadron.jpg|thumb|A KC-10 Extender]]\nSome tankers have both a boom and one or more complete hose-and-drogue systems. The USAF [[KC-10]] has both a flying boom and also a separate hose and drogue system manufactured by Cobham plc. Both are on the aircraft centerline at the tail of the aircraft, so only one system can be used at once. However, such a system allows all types of probe- and receptacle-equipped aircraft to be refueled in a single mission, without landing to install an adapter. Many KC-135s and some KC-10s are also equipped with dual under-wing hose-and-drogue attachments known as [[Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker#Further upgrades and derivatives|Multi-point Refueling System]] (MPRSs) or Wing Air Refueling Pods (WARPs), respectively.\n\n===Wing-to-wing===\nIn this method, similar to the probe-and-drogue method but more complicated, the tanker aircraft released a flexible hose from its wingtip. An aircraft, flying beside it, had to catch the hose with a special lock under its wingtip. After the hose was locked, and the connection was established, the fuel was pumped. It was used on a small number of Soviet [[Tu-4]] and [[Tu-16]] only (the tanker variant was Tu-16Z).<ref>note&nbsp;\u2014 even today there is much confusion about how this system actually worked</ref>\n\n===Simple grappling===\nSome historic systems used for pioneering aerial refueling used the grappling method, where the tanker aircraft unreeled the fuel hose and the receiver aircraft would grapple the hose midair, reel it in and connect it so that fuel can be transferred either with the assistance of pumps or simply by [[siphon|gravity feed]]. This was the method used on the [[Question Mark (airplane)|Question Mark]] endurance flight in 1929.\n\n==Compatibility issues==\nThe probe-and-drogue system is not compatible with flying boom equipment, creating a problem for military planners where mixed forces are involved.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{Cite journal|last=Christopher|first=Bolkcom|last2=D.|first2=Klaus, Jon|date=2005-05-11|title=Air Force Aerial Refueling Methods: Flying Boom versus Hose-and-Drogue|url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/govdocs/crs/permalink/meta-crs-6702:1|journal=Digital Library|language=English}}</ref> Incompatibility can also complicate the procurement of new systems&nbsp;\u2014 the Royal Canadian Air Force currently wish to purchase the [[Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II#F-35A|F-35A]], which can only refuel via the flying boom, but only possess [[CC-150|probe-and-drogue refuelers]]. The potential cost of converting F-35As to probe-and-drogue refueling (as is used on U.S. Navy & Marine Corps [[Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II#F-35B|F-35B]]s and [[Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II#F-35C|F-35C]]s) has added to the political controversy which already surrounds F-35 procurement within the RCAF.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.macleans.ca/general/canadian-military-unable-to-refuel-new-jets-in-mid-air/ |title= Canadian military unable to refuel new jets in mid-air |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=31 Jan 2011 |website=Macleans.ca |publisher= |access-date=13 June 2015 |quote=}}</ref>\n\nThese concerns can be addressed by drogue adapters (see section \"Boom drogue adapter units\" above) that allow drogue aircraft to refuel from boom-equipped aircraft, and by refuelers which are equipped with both drogue and boom units and can thus refuel both types in the same flight, such as the KC-10, MPRS KC-135, or Airbus A330 MRTT.\n\n===Strategic===\n[[File:A KC-135 Stratotanker from the 127th Air Refueling Group performs a night time refueling for a C-17 Globemaster III.jpg|\nthumb|left|A [[C-17 Globemaster III]] receives fuel from a KC-135, at night]] \nThe development of the [[Boeing KC-97 Stratofreighter|KC-97]] and [[Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker]]s was pushed by the [[Cold War]] requirement of the [[United States]] to be able to keep fleets of [[nuclear bomb|nuclear]]-armed [[B-47 Stratojet]] and [[B-52 Stratofortress]] [[strategic bombers]] airborne around-the-clock either to threaten retaliation against a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] strike for [[mutual assured destruction]], or to bomb the U.S.S.R. first had it been ordered to do so by the [[President of the United States]]. The bombers would fly orbits around their assigned positions from which they were to enter Soviet airspace if they received the order, and the tankers would refill the bombers' fuel tanks so that they could keep a force in the air 24 hours a day, and still have enough fuel to reach their targets in the Soviet Union. This also ensured that a [[first strike]] against the bombers' [[airfield]]s could not obliterate the U.S.'s ability to retaliate by bomber.\n\nIn 1958, Valiant tankers in the UK were developed with one HDU mounted in the bomb-bay. Valiant tankers of 214 Squadron were used to demonstrate radius of action by refueling a Valiant bomber non-stop from UK to Singapore in 1960 and a Vulcan bomber to Australia in 1961. Other UK exercises involving refueling aircraft from Valiant tankers included [[Gloster Javelin|Javelin]] and [[English Electric Lightning|Lightning]] fighters, also Vulcan and Victor bombers. For instance, in 1962 a squadron of Javelin air defense aircraft was refueled in stages from the UK to [[India]] and back (exercise \"Shiksha\"). After the retirement of the Valiant in 1965, the Handley Page Victor took over the UK refueling role and had three hoses (HDUs).  These were a fuselage-mounted HDU and a refueling pod on each wing. The center hose could refuel any probe-equipped aircraft, the wing pods could refuel the more maneuverable fighter/ground attack types.\n\nA byproduct of this development effort and the building of large numbers of tankers was that these tankers were also available to refuel [[cargo aircraft]], [[fighter aircraft]], and [[ground attack aircraft]], in addition to bombers, for ferrying to distant theaters of operations. This was much used during the [[Vietnam War]], when many aircraft could not have covered the transoceanic distances without aerial refueling, even with intermediate bases in [[Hawaii]] and [[Okinawa]]. In addition to allowing the transport of the aircraft themselves, the cargo aircraft could also carry [[mat\u00e9riel]], supplies, and personnel to [[Vietnam]] without landing to refuel. KC-135s were also frequently used for refueling of air combat missions from air bases in Thailand.\n\nThe USAF [[SR-71 Blackbird]] strategic reconnaissance aircraft made frequent use of air-to-air refueling. Indeed, design considerations of the aircraft made its mission impossible without aerial refueling. Based at [[Beale AFB]] in central [[California]], SR-71s had to be forward deployed to Europe and Japan prior to flying actual reconnaissance missions. These trans-Pacific and trans-Atlantic flights during deployment were impossible without aerial refueling. The SR-71's designers traded takeoff performance for better high-speed, high-altitude performance, necessitating takeoff with less-than-full fuel tanks from even the longest runways. Once airborne, the Blackbird would accelerate to supersonic speed using afterburners to facilitate structural heating and expansion. The magnitude of temperature changes experienced by the SR-71, from parked to its maximum speed, resulted in significant expansion of its structural parts in cruise flight. To allow for the expansion, the Blackbird's parts had to fit loosely when cold, so loosely, in fact, that the Blackbird constantly leaked fuel before heating expanded the airframe enough to seal its fuel tanks. Following the supersonic dash, and to stop the fuel leaks, the SR-71 would then rendezvous with a tanker to fill its now nearly empty tanks before proceeding on its mission. This was referred to as the ''LTTR'' (for \"Launch To Tanker Rendezvous\") profile. LTTR had the added advantage of providing an operational test of the Blackbird's refueling capability within minutes after takeoff, enabling a Return-To-Launch-Site abort capability if necessary. At its most efficient altitude and speed, the Blackbird was capable of flying for many hours without refueling. The SR-71 used a special fuel, [[JP-7]], with a very high [[flash point]] to withstand the extreme skin temperatures generated during Mach 3+ cruise flight.<ref name=SR-71.org>{{cite web|title=Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird|url=http://www.sr-71.org/blackbird/sr-71/|accessdate=8 February 2014}}</ref>  While JP-7 could be used by other aircraft, its burn characteristics posed problems in certain situations (such as high-altitude, emergency engine starts) that made it less than optimal for aircraft other than the SR-71.\n\nNormally, all the fuel aboard a tanker aircraft may be either offloaded, or burned by the tanker as necessary. To make this possible, the KC-135 fuel system incorporated gravity draining and pumps to allow moving fuel from tank to tank depending on mission needs. Mixing JP-7 with JP-4 or Jet A, however, rendered it unsuitable for use by the SR-71, so the US Air Force commissioned a specially modified KC-135 variant, the [[KC-135#Variants|KC-135Q]], which included changes to the fuel system and operating procedures preventing inadvertent inflight mixing of fuel intended for offload with fuel intended for use by the tanker. SR-71 aircraft were refueled exclusively by KC-135Q tankers.\n\nThe French strategic [[Force de dissuasion]] or Force de frappe strategic nuclear deterrent force uses KC-135 tankers to refuel and extend the range of [[Dassault Mirage 2000N/2000D|Mirage 2000N]] fighter-bombers and, before their retirement, [[Dassault Mirage IV]] supersonic bombers which were sometimes planned to operate in pairs, one armed, and one carrying a buddy pack air refueling pod.\n[[File:Refuelling a Sukhoi Su-34 (cropped).jpg|thumb|A [[Russian Air Force]] [[Sukhoi Su-34]] takes on fuel through a Probe-and-drogue system]]\nIsrael has a fleet of Boeing 707s equipped with a boom refueling system similar to the KC-135, used to refuel and extend the range of fighter bombers such as the F-15I and F-16I for deterrent and strike missions.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JW1lHcbIXYM|title=\u05ea\u05d3\u05dc\u05d5\u05e7 \u05d0\u05d5\u05d5\u05d9\u05e8\u05d9|last=Israeli Air Force|date=10 October 2013|publisher=|accessdate=19 November 2016|via=YouTube}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.defensemedianetwork.com/stories/first-strike-on-irans-nuclear-facilities-part-1/|title=Israel's First Strike on Iran's Nuclear Facilities \u2013 Part 1 - Defense Media Network|publisher=|accessdate=19 November 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Tactical===\nTankers are considered \"force multipliers\", because they convey considerable tactical advantages. Primarily, aerial refueling adds to the combat radius of attack, fighter and bombers aircraft, and allows patrol aircraft to remain airborne longer, thereby reducing the numbers of aircraft necessary to accomplish a given mission. Aerial refueling can also mitigate basing issues which might otherwise place limitations on combat [[Payload (air and space craft)|payload]]. Combat aircraft operating from airfields with shorter runways must limit their takeoff weight, which could mean a choice between range (fuel) and combat payload (munitions). Aerial refueling, however, eliminates many of these basing difficulties because a combat aircraft can take off with a full combat payload and refuel immediately.\n\nAside from these issues, the psychological advantage of full fuel tanks&nbsp;\u2013 and a tanker likely available nearby&nbsp;\u2013 gives a pilot a distinct edge in combat. In most combat situations, speed is a necessity for optimal completion of the mission at hand.\nAs high speeds require fuel, pilots must always balance fuel and speed requirements. Pilots operating aircraft with aerial refueling capability eliminate low-fuel concerns.\n\n==Operational History== \n====Vietnam War====\n\nDuring the [[Vietnam War]], it was common for USAF fighter-bombers flying from [[Thailand]] to [[North Vietnam]] to refuel from KC-135s en route to their target. Besides extending their range, this enabled the [[F-105]]s and [[F-4 Phantom]]s to carry more bombs and rockets. Tankers were also available for refueling on the way back if necessary. In addition to ferrying aircraft across the [[Pacific Ocean]], aerial refueling made it possible for battle-damaged fighters, with heavily leaking fuel tanks, to hook up to the tankers and let the tanker feed its engine(s) until the point where they could glide to the base and land. This saved numerous aircraft. {{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\nThe US Navy frequently used carrier-based aerial tankers like the [[A-3 Skywarrior|KA-3 Skywarrior]] to refuel Navy and Marine aircraft such as the F-4, [[A-4 Skyhawk]], [[A-6 Intruder]], and [[A-7 Corsair II]]. This was particularly useful when a pilot returning from an airstrike was having difficulty landing and was running low on [[jet fuel]]. This gave him fuel for more attempts at landing for a successful \"trap\" on an aircraft carrier. The KA-3 could also refuel fighters on extended Combat Air Patrol. USMC jets based in South Vietnam and Thailand also used USMC [[KC-130]] Hercules transports for air-to-air refueling on missions.\n[[File:HC-130P refuels HH-3E over Southeast Asia (cropped).jpg|thumb|HC-130P refuels HH-3E over Southeast Asia ]]\n====Middle East====\nDuring the 1980s [[Iran\u2013Iraq War]], the Iranian Air Force maintained at least one KC 707-3J9C aerial tanker, which the Islamic Republic had inherited from the Shah's government. This was used most effectively on April 4, 1981, refueling eight IRIAF F-4 Phantoms on long-range sorties into Iraq to [[H-3 airstrike|bomb the H-3 Al Walid airfield]] near the Jordanian border.<ref>Air Forces Monthly Special ''F-4 Phantom'' {{ISBN|0-946219-46-X}}  article by Farzin Nadimi p77</ref>. In 1985, Israeli [[F-15]]s used heavily modified [[Boeing 707]] aircraft to provide aerial refueling over the [[Mediterranean Sea]] in order to extend their range for the 2,000&nbsp;km flight during the [[Operation Wooden Leg]] air raid on the headquarters of the [[Palestine Liberation Organization|PLO]] near [[Tunis]], [[Tunisia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/israel/iaf.htm|title=Israel Air Force - Israel|first=John|last=Pike|publisher=|accessdate=19 November 2016}}</ref>\n\n====Falklands War====\nDuring the [[Falklands War]], aerial refueling played a vital role in all of the successful Argentine attacks against the [[Royal Navy]]. The [[Argentine Air Force]] had only two KC-130H Hercules available and they were used to refuel both Air Force and Navy [[A-4 Skyhawk]]s and Navy [[Super Etendard]]s in their [[Exocet]] strikes. The Hercules on several occasions approached the islands (where the [[Sea Harrier]]s were in patrol) to search and guide the A-4s in their returning flights. On one of those flights (callsign ''Jaguar'') one of the KC-130s went to rescue a damaged A-4 and delivered {{convert|39000|lb|abbr=on}} of fuel while carrying it to its airfield at [[Puerto San Juli\u00e1n|San Julian]]. However, the [[Mirage III]]s and [[IAI Nesher|Daggers]] lack of air refueling capability prevented them from achieving better results. The Mirages were unable to reach the islands with a strike payload, and the Daggers could do so only for a five-minute strike flight.\n\nOn the British side, air refueling was carried out by the [[Handley Page Victor]] K.2 and, after the Argentine surrender, by modified C-130 Hercules tankers. These aircraft aided deployments from the UK to the [[Ascension Island]] staging post in the Atlantic and further deployments south of bomber, transport and maritime patrol aircraft. The most famous refueling missions were the 8,000&nbsp;nmi (15,000&nbsp;km) \"[[Operation Black Buck]]\" sorties which used 14 Victor tankers to allow an [[Avro Vulcan]] bomber (with a flying reserve bomber) to attack the Argentine-captured airfield at Port Stanley on the [[Falkland Islands]]. With all the aircraft flying from Ascension, the tankers themselves needed refueling. The raids were the longest-range bombing raids in history until surpassed by the [[Boeing B-52]]s flying from the States to bomb Iraq in the 1991 [[Gulf War]] and later [[B-2 Spirit|B-2]] flights.\n\n====Gulf War====\nDuring the time of Operation Desert Shield, the military buildup to the Persian Gulf War, US Air Force Boeing KC-135s & McDonnell Douglas KC-10As, and USMC KC-130 Hercules aircraft were deployed to forward air bases in [[England]], [[Diego Garcia]], and [[Saudi Arabia]]. Aircraft stationed in Saudi Arabia normally maintained an orbit in the [[Saudi\u2013Iraqi neutral zone]], informally known as \"Frisbee\", and refueled coalition aircraft whenever necessary. Two side by side tracks over central Saudi Arabia called \"Prune\" and \"Raisin\" featured 2\u20134 basket equipped KC-135 tankers each and were used by Navy aircraft from the [[Red Sea Battle Force]]. Large Navy strike groups from the Red Sea would send A-6 tankers to the Prune and Raisin tracks ahead of the strike aircraft arriving to top off and take up station to the right of the Air Force tankers thereby providing an additional tanking point. RAF Handley Page Victor and [[Vickers VC10]] tankers were also used to refuel British and coalition aircraft and were popular with the US Navy for their docile basket behavior and having three point refueling stations. An additional track was maintained close to the northwest border for the E-3 AWACS aircraft and any Navy aircraft needing emergency fuel. These 24-hour air-refueling zones helped make the intense air campaign during Operation Desert Storm possible. An additional 24/7 tanker presence was maintained over the Red Sea itself to refuel Navy F-14 Tomcats maintaining [[Combat Air Patrol]] tracks. During the last week of the conflict, KC-10 tankers moved inside Iraq to support barrier CAP missions set up to block Iraqi fighters from escaping to Iran.\n[[File:Exercise Angel Thunder 2014 140512-F-IE715-1625.jpg|thumb|left|A [[French Air Force]] [[Eurocopter EC725|EC725]] is refueled by a [[Lockheed HC-130]] during Exercise Angel Thunder]]\nOn January 16\u201317, 1991, the first combat sortie of Operation Desert Storm, and the longest combat sortie in history, at that time, was launched from [[Barksdale AFB, Louisiana]]. Seven B-52Gs flew a thirty-five-hour mission to the [[Persian Gulf]] region, and back, to launch Boeing Air Launched Cruise Missiles (ALCMs) with the surprise use of conventional warheads. All of this was made possible by in-flight refueling, and by the secret switch away from nuclear warheads on the ALCMs.\n\nAn extremely useful aerial tanker in Desert Storm was the USAF KC-10A Extender. Besides being larger than the other tankers, the KC-10A is equipped with the USAF \"boom\" refueling and also the \"hose-and-drogue\" system. This makes it possible for the KC-10A to refuel USAF aircraft, and also USMC and US Navy jets that use the \"probe-and-drogue\" system, and also allied aircraft, such as those from the UK and Saudi Arabia. KC-135s may be equipped with a drogue depending on the mission profile.\n\nThe KC-10A was originally designed for the support of NATO in Europe by the USAF. In the case of armed conflict, with a full jet fuel load, the KC-10A is capable of flying from a base on the east coast of the US or Canada, flying nonstop to Europe, transferring a considerable amount of fuel in air-to-air refueling, and then returning to its home base, all without landing anywhere. This could have been very useful in the Cold War era when numerous European bases would (probably) have been disabled by Warsaw Pact strikes in [[Germany]], [[Italy]], the [[Netherlands]], [[France]], and the [[United Kingdom]].\n\n===Helicopters===\nHelicopter In-Flight Refueling (HIFR) is a variation of aerial refueling when a naval [[helicopter]] approaches a warship (not necessarily suited for landing operations) and receives fuel through the cabin while hovering.  Alternatively, some helicopters equipped with a probe extending out the front can be refueled from a drogue-equipped tanker aircraft in a similar manner to fixed-wing aircraft by matching a high forward speed for a helicopter to a slow speed for the fixed-wing tanker.\n\n==Longest manned flight record==\nA mission modified [[Cessna 172 Skyhawk]] with a crew of two set the world record for the longest continuous manned flight without landing of 64 days, 22 hours, 19 minutes, and five seconds in 1958 by refueling and transferring food and supplies from a [[convertible]] top [[Ford Thunderbird]] automobile. The publicity flight for a Las Vegas area hotel ended when the aircraft's performance had degraded to the point where the Cessna had difficulty climbing away from the refueling car.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://untoldvalor.blogspot.co.il/2008/07/plane-that-flew-for-62-days-and-t-bird.html|title=The Plane that Flew for 62 Days and the T-Bird that Saved the Day|publisher=|accessdate=19 November 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aopa.org/News-and-Video/All-News/2008/March/1/Endurance-Test-Circa-1958|title=Endurance Test, Circa 1958|date=3 January 2008|publisher=|accessdate=19 November 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Developments==\n\n* Commercial tankers are occasionally used by military forces.

[[Centrifugal pump]]s are also turbomachines that transfer energy from a rotor to a fluid, usually a liquid, while turbines and compressors usually work with a gas.<ref name=\"Logan1\" />\n\n== History ==\nThe first turbomachines could be identified as [[water wheel]]s, which appeared between the 3rd and 1st centuries BCE in the Mediterranean region. These were used throughout the medieval period and began the first [[Industrial Revolution]]. When [[steam power]] started to be used, as the first power source driven by the combustion of a fuel rather than renewable natural power sources, this was as [[reciprocating engine]]s. Primitive turbines and conceptual designs for them, such as the [[smoke jack]], appeared intermittently but the temperatures and pressures required for a practically efficient turbine exceeded the manufacturing technology of the time. The first patent for gas turbines were filed in 1791 by [[John Barber (engineer)|John Barber]].  Practical hydroelectric water turbines and steam turbines did not appear until the 1880s. Gas turbines appeared in the 1930s.\n\nThe first impulse type turbine was created by Carl Gustaf de Laval in 1883. This was closely followed by the first practical reaction type turbine in 1884, built by [[Charles Algernon Parsons|Charles Parsons]]. Parsons\u2019 first design was a multi-stage axial-flow unit, which [[George Westinghouse]] acquired and began manufacturing in 1895, while [[General Electric]] acquired de Laval's designs in 1897. Since then, development has skyrocketed from Parsons\u2019 early design, producing 0.746&nbsp;kW, to modern nuclear steam turbines producing upwards of 1500 MW. Today, steam turbines account for roughly 90% of electrical power generated in the United States.{{fact|reason=Gas-fired turbines and combined-cycle plants in the UK are now over 50%, with the coal-fired steam turbine seriously diminished. Although 90% was certainly a peak figure for electricity generation in many industrialised countries, this is no longer the case.|date=April 2019}} Then the first functioning industrial gas turbines were used in the late 1890s to power street lights (Meher-Homji, 2000).\n\n==Classification==\n[[File:SteamTurbine.jpg|thumb|A steam turbine from [[MAN SE]] subsidiary MAN Turbo]]\nIn general, the two kinds of turbomachines encountered in practice are open and closed turbomachines. Open machines such as [[propeller]]s, [[windmill]]s, and unshrouded [[mechanical fan|fan]]s act on an infinite extent of fluid, whereas closed machines operate on a finite quantity of fluid as it passes through a housing or casing.<ref name=\"Tamili1\" />\n\nTurbomachines are also categorized according to the type of flow. When the flow is parallel to the [[axis of rotation]], they are called axial flow machines, and when flow is perpendicular to the axis of rotation, they are referred to as radial (or centrifugal) flow machines. There is also a third category, called mixed flow machines, where both radial and axial flow velocity components are present.<ref name=\"Tamili1\" />\n\nTurbomachines may be further classified into two additional categories: those that absorb energy to increase the [[fluid pressure]], i.e. [[pump]]s, [[Fan (mechanical)|fans]], and [[Gas compressor|compressors]], and those that produce energy such as [[turbine]]s by expanding flow to lower pressures. Of particular interest are applications which contain pumps, fans, compressors and turbines.

The nozzle serves to change the incoming pressure into velocity, the [[enthalpy]] of the fluid decreases as the velocity increases. Pressure and enthalpy drop over the rotor blades is minimal. Velocity will decrease over the rotor.<ref name=\"Logan1\" /><ref name=\"Dixon1\" />\n\n[[Newton's second law]] describes the transfer of energy. Impulse turbomachines do not require a pressure casement around the rotor since the fluid jet is created by the nozzle prior to reaching the blading on the rotor.\n\nA [[Pelton wheel]] is an impulse design.\n\n[[File:A Reaction Turbomachine Stage.svg|thumb|centre|A Reaction Turbomachine Stage<ref name=\"Logan1\" />]]\n''Reaction Turbomachines'' operate by reacting to the flow of fluid through aerofoil shaped rotor and stator blades. The velocity of the fluid through the sets of blades increases slightly (as with a nozzle) as it passes from rotor to stator and vice versa. The velocity of the fluid then decreases again once it has passed between the gap. Pressure and enthalpy consistently decrease through the sets of blades.<ref name=\"Logan1\" />\n\n[[Newton's third law]] describes the transfer of energy for reaction turbines. A pressure casement is needed to contain the working fluid. For compressible working fluids, multiple turbine stages are usually used to harness the expanding gas efficiently.\n\nMost turbomachines use a combination of impulse and reaction in their design, often with impulse and reaction parts on the same blade.\n\n==Dimensionless ratios to describe turbomachinery==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2015}}\n[[File:Walchenseewerk Pelton 120.jpg|thumb|[[Pelton wheel]] being installed into [[Walchensee Hydroelectric Power Station]].]]\nThe following dimensionless ratios are often used for the characterisation of fluid machines.  They allow a comparison of flow machines with different dimensions and boundary conditions.\n#Pressure range '''\u03c8'''\n#Flow coefficient '''\u03c6''' (including delivery or volume number called)\n#Performance numbers '''\u03bb'''\n#Run number '''\u03c3'''\n#Diameter Number '''\u03b4'''\n\n== Applications ==\n\n=== Power Generation ===\n[[Hydroelectricity|'''Hydro electric''']]- Hydro-electric turbomachinery uses potential energy stored in water to flow over an open impeller to turn a generator which creates electricity\n\n[[Steam turbine|'''Steam turbines''']]- Steam turbines used in power generation come in many different variations. The overall principle is high pressure steam is forced over blades attached to a shaft, which turns a generator. As the steam travels through the turbine, it passes through smaller blades causing the shaft to spin faster, creating more electricity.\n\n[[Gas turbine|'''Gas turbines''']]- Gas turbines work much like steam turbines. Air is forced in through a series of blades that turn a shaft. Then fuel is mixed with the air and causes a combustion reaction, increasing the power. This then causes the shaft to spin faster, creating more electricity.\n\n[[Wind turbine|'''Windmills''']]- Also known as a wind turbine, windmills are increasing in popularity for their ability to efficiently use the wind to generate electricity. Although they come in many shapes and sizes, the most common one is the large three-blade. The blades work on the same principle as an airplane wing. As wind passes over the blades, it creates an area of low and high pressure, causing the blade to move, spinning a shaft and creating electricity. It is most like a steam turbine, but works with an infinite supply of wind.\n\n=== Marine ===\n'''Steam turbine'''- Steam turbines in marine applications are very similar to those in power generation. The few differences between them are size and power output. Steam turbines on ships are much smaller because they don't need to power a whole town. They aren't very common because of their high initial cost, high specific fuel consumption, and expensive machinery that goes with it.\n\n'''Gas turbines'''- Gas turbines in marine applications are becoming more popular due to their smaller size, increased efficiency, and ability to burn cleaner fuels. They run just like gas turbines for power generation, but are also much smaller and do require more machinery for propulsion. They are most popular in naval ships as they can be at a dead stop to full power in minutes (Kayadelen, 2013), and are much smaller for a given amount of power.\nFlow of air through a turbocharger and engine\n\n'''[[Pump-jet|Water jet]]-''' Essentially a waterjet drive is like an aircraft turbojet with the difference that the operating fluid is water instead of air.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.castoldijet.it/en/waterjet_en/waterjet_drive_propulsion_systems.html|title=Waterjet drives propulsion systems|website=www.castoldijet.it|access-date=2017-10-12}}</ref> Water jets are best suited to fast vessels and are thus used often by the military. Water jet propulsion has many advantages over other forms of marine propulsion, such as stern drives, outboard motors, shafted propellers and surface drives.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.hamiltonjet.com/global/waterjet-overview|title=WaterJet Overview|date=2015-03-18|work=HamiltonJet|access-date=2017-10-12|language=en}}</ref>\n\n=== Auto ===\n[[File:Turbocharger Animation by Tyroola.gif|thumb|Air and exhaust flow through engine and turbocharger]]\n[[Turbocharger|'''Turbochargers''']]- Turbochargers are one of the most popular turbomachines. They are used mainly for adding power to engines by adding more air. It combines both forms of turbomachines. Exhaust gases from the engine spin a bladed wheel, much like a turbine. That wheel then spins another bladed wheel, sucking and compressing outside air into the engine.\n\n[[Supercharger|'''Superchargers''']]- Superchargers are used for engine-power enhancement as well, but only work off the principle of compression. They use the mechanical power from the engine to spin a screw or vane, some way to suck in and compress the air into the engine.\n\n=== General ===\n[[Pump|'''Pumps''']]- Pumps are another very popular turbomachine. Although there are very many different types of pumps, they all do the same thing. Pumps are used to move fluids around using some sort of mechanical power, from electric motors to full size diesel engines. Pumps have thousands of uses, and are the true basis to turbomachinery (\u0160korp\u00edk, 2017).\n\n[[Air compressor|'''Air compressors''']]- Air compressors are another very popular turbomachine. They work on the principle of compression by sucking in and compressing air into a holding tank. Air compressors are one of the most basic turbomachines.\n\n'''[[Mechanical fan|Fans]]'''- Fans are the most general type of turbomachines. They work opposite of wind turbines. Mechanical power spins the blades, forcing air through them and forcing out. Basic desk-top fans to large turbofan airplane engines work this way.\n\n=== Aerospace ===\n'''Gas turbines'''- Aerospace gas turbines, more commonly known as jet engines, are the most common gas turbines. They are the most like power generation turbines because the electricity used on the airplane is from the turbines, while also providing the propulsion. These turbines are the smallest out of the industrial turbines, and are most often the most advanced.\n\n[[Turbopump|'''Turbopumps''']]- Rocket engines require very high propellant pressures and mass flow rates, meaning their pumps require a lot of power. One of the most common solutions to this issue is to use a turbopump that extracts energy from an energetic fluid flow. The source of this energetic fluid flow could be one or a combination of many things, including the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide, the combustion of a portion of the propellants, or even the heating of cryogenic propellants run through coolant jackets in the combustion chamber's walls.\n\n==Partial list of turbomachine topics==\nMany types of dynamic continuous flow turbomachinery exist.  Below is a partial list of these types.  What is notable about these turbomachines is that the same fundamentals apply to all.  Certainly there are significant differences between these machines and between the types of analysis that are typically applied to specific cases.  This does not negate the fact that they are unified by the same underlying physics of fluid dynamics, gas dynamics, aerodynamics, hydrodynamics, and thermodynamics.\n\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n*[[Axial compressor]]\n*[[Axial fan]]\n*[[Centrifugal compressor]]\n*[[Centrifugal fan]]\n*[[Centrifugal pump]]\n*[[Centrifugal type supercharger]]\n* [[Exoskeletal engine]]\n*[[Francis turbine]]\n*[[Gas turbine]]\n*[[Industrial fans]]\n*[[Jet engine]]\n*[[Mechanical fan]]\n*[[Mixed flow compressor]]\n*[[Radial turbine]]\n*[[Steam turbine]]\n*[[Turbocharger]]\n*[[Turboexpander]]\n*[[Turbofans]]\n*[[Turbojet]]\n*[[Turboprop]]\n*[[Turbopump]]\n*[[Turboshaft]]\n*[[Turbines]]\n*[[Water turbine]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[secondary flow#Turbomachinery|Secondary flow in turbomachinery]]\n* [[Slip factor]]\n* [[Blade solidity]]\n* [[Three-dimensional losses and correlation in turbomachinery]]\n* [[Effects of mach number and shock losses in turbomachines]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n* S.

For compressible working fluids, multiple turbine stages are usually used to harness the expanding gas efficiently.\n\nMost turbomachines use a combination of impulse and reaction in their design, often with impulse and reaction parts on the same blade.\n\n==Dimensionless ratios to describe turbomachinery==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2015}}\n[[File:Walchenseewerk Pelton 120.jpg|thumb|[[Pelton wheel]] being installed into [[Walchensee Hydroelectric Power Station]].]]\nThe following dimensionless ratios are often used for the characterisation of fluid machines.  They allow a comparison of flow machines with different dimensions and boundary conditions.\n#Pressure range '''\u03c8'''\n#Flow coefficient '''\u03c6''' (including delivery or volume number called)\n#Performance numbers '''\u03bb'''\n#Run number '''\u03c3'''\n#Diameter Number '''\u03b4'''\n\n== Applications ==\n\n=== Power Generation ===\n[[Hydroelectricity|'''Hydro electric''']]- Hydro-electric turbomachinery uses potential energy stored in water to flow over an open impeller to turn a generator which creates electricity\n\n[[Steam turbine|'''Steam turbines''']]- Steam turbines used in power generation come in many different variations. The overall principle is high pressure steam is forced over blades attached to a shaft, which turns a generator. As the steam travels through the turbine, it passes through smaller blades causing the shaft to spin faster, creating more electricity.\n\n[[Gas turbine|'''Gas turbines''']]- Gas turbines work much like steam turbines. Air is forced in through a series of blades that turn a shaft. Then fuel is mixed with the air and causes a combustion reaction, increasing the power. This then causes the shaft to spin faster, creating more electricity.\n\n[[Wind turbine|'''Windmills''']]- Also known as a wind turbine, windmills are increasing in popularity for their ability to efficiently use the wind to generate electricity. Although they come in many shapes and sizes, the most common one is the large three-blade. The blades work on the same principle as an airplane wing. As wind passes over the blades, it creates an area of low and high pressure, causing the blade to move, spinning a shaft and creating electricity. It is most like a steam turbine, but works with an infinite supply of wind.\n\n=== Marine ===\n'''Steam turbine'''- Steam turbines in marine applications are very similar to those in power generation. The few differences between them are size and power output. Steam turbines on ships are much smaller because they don\u2019t need to power a whole town. They aren\u2019t very common because of their high initial cost, high specific fuel consumption, and expensive machinery that goes with it.\n\n'''Gas turbines'''- Gas turbines in marine applications are becoming more popular due to their smaller size, increased efficiency, and ability to burn cleaner fuels. They run just like gas turbines for power generation, but are also much smaller and do require more machinery for propulsion. They are most popular in naval ships as they can be at a dead stop to full power in minutes (Kayadelen, 2013), and are much smaller for a given amount of power.\nFlow of air through a turbocharger and engine\n\n'''[[Pump-jet|Water jet]]-''' Essentially a waterjet drive is like an aircraft turbojet with the difference that the operating fluid is water instead of air.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.castoldijet.it/en/waterjet_en/waterjet_drive_propulsion_systems.html|title=Waterjet drives propulsion systems|website=www.castoldijet.it|access-date=2017-10-12}}</ref> Water jets are best suited to fast vessels and are thus used often by the military. Water jet propulsion has many advantages over other forms of marine propulsion, such as stern drives, outboard motors, shafted propellers and surface drives.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.hamiltonjet.com/global/waterjet-overview|title=WaterJet Overview|date=2015-03-18|work=HamiltonJet|access-date=2017-10-12|language=en}}</ref>\n\n=== Auto ===\n[[File:Turbocharger Animation by Tyroola.gif|thumb|Air and exhaust flow through engine and turbocharger]]\n[[Turbocharger|'''Turbochargers''']]- Turbochargers are one of the most popular turbomachines. They are used mainly for adding power to engines by adding more air. It combines both forms of turbomachines. Exhaust gases from the engine spin a bladed wheel, much like a turbine. That wheel then spins another bladed wheel, sucking and compressing outside air into the engine.\n\n[[Supercharger|'''Superchargers''']]- Superchargers are used for engine-power enhancement as well, but only work off the principle of compression. They use the mechanical power from the engine to spin a screw or vane, some way to suck in and compress the air into the engine.\n\n=== General ===\n[[Pump|'''Pumps''']]- Pumps are another very popular turbomachine. Although there are very many different types of pumps, they all do the same thing. Pumps are used to move fluids around using some sort of mechanical power, from electric motors to full size diesel engines. Pumps have thousands of uses, and are the true basis to turbomachinery (\u0160korp\u00edk, 2017).\n\n[[Air compressor|'''Air compressors''']]- Air compressors are another very popular turbomachine. They work on the principle of compression by sucking in and compressing air into a holding tank. Air compressors are one of the most basic turbomachines.\n\n'''[[Mechanical fan|Fans]]'''- Fans are the most general type of turbomachines. They work opposite of wind turbines. Mechanical power spins the blades, forcing air through them and forcing out. Basic desk-top fans to large turbofan airplane engines work this way.\n\n=== Aerospace ===\n'''Gas turbines'''- Aerospace gas turbines, more commonly known as jet engines, are the most common gas turbines. They are the most like power generation turbines because the electricity used on the airplane is from the turbines, while also providing the propulsion. These turbines are the smallest out of the industrial turbines, and are most often the most advanced.\n\n[[Turbopump|'''Turbopumps''']]- Rocket engines require very high propellant pressures and mass flow rates, meaning their pumps require a lot of power. One of the most common solutions to this issue is to use a turbopump that extracts energy from an energetic fluid flow. The source of this energetic fluid flow could be one or a combination of many things, including the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide, the combustion of a portion of the propellants, or even the heating of cryogenic propellants run through coolant jackets in the combustion chamber's walls.\n\n==Partial list of turbomachine topics==\nMany types of dynamic continuous flow turbomachinery exist.  Below is a partial list of these types.  What is notable about these turbomachines is that the same fundamentals apply to all.  Certainly there are significant differences between these machines and between the types of analysis that are typically applied to specific cases.  This does not negate the fact that they are unified by the same underlying physics of fluid dynamics, gas dynamics, aerodynamics, hydrodynamics, and thermodynamics.\n\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n*[[Axial compressor]]\n*[[Axial fan]]\n*[[Centrifugal compressor]]\n*[[Centrifugal fan]]\n*[[Centrifugal pump]]\n*[[Centrifugal type supercharger]]\n* [[Exoskeletal engine]]\n*[[Francis turbine]]\n*[[Gas turbine]]\n*[[Industrial fans]]\n*[[Jet engine]]\n*[[Mechanical fan]]\n*[[Mixed flow compressor]]\n*[[Radial turbine]]\n*[[Steam turbine]]\n*[[Turbocharger]]\n*[[Turboexpander]]\n*[[Turbofans]]\n*[[Turbojet]]\n*[[Turboprop]]\n*[[Turbopump]]\n*[[Turboshaft]]\n*[[Turbines]]\n*[[Water turbine]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[secondary flow#Turbomachinery|Secondary flow in turbomachinery]]\n* [[Slip factor]]\n* [[Blade solidity]]\n* [[Three-dimensional losses and correlation in turbomachinery]]\n* [[Effects of mach number and shock losses in turbomachines]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n* S.

A tropical depression in early October was captured by a high-altitude photograph on a rocket, thus producing the first large-scale image of a tropical cyclone. The strongest and deadliest hurricane of the season was [[Hurricane Hazel]], which killed thousands in [[Haiti]] before striking near the [[North Carolina]]/[[South Carolina]] border in October. It caused heavy damage in the United States before becoming [[extratropical cyclone|extratropical]] and affecting [[Ontario]]. Intense rainfall affected [[Toronto]] with severe flooding, leaving significant damage. The season officially ended on November&nbsp;15, although another hurricane named [[Hurricane Alice (December 1954)|Alice]] developed on December&nbsp;30 to the northeast of the Lesser Antilles; it lasted until January&nbsp;6 of the following year.

The system moved slowly north-northeastward, emerging into the western Atlantic Ocean at 06:00&nbsp;UTC on June&nbsp;20. Shortly thereafter, the depression intensified into a tropical storm, although the structure was broad and asymmetric due to association with a nearby [[cold-core low|upper-level low]], signaling that the system was possibly a subtropical cyclone. Ship reports in the region indicate that the storm continued to intensify. On June&nbsp;22, the structure became much more symmetrical while passing just off the Outer Banks, bringing winds of 33&nbsp;mph (54&nbsp;km/h) to [[Wilmington, North Carolina]]. That day, the Hurricane Hunters estimated winds of 80&nbsp;mph (130&nbsp;km/h), and is possible that the storm briefly attained hurricane status. The peak winds were estimated at 70&nbsp;mph (110&nbsp;km/h), due to a pressure reading of {{convert|994|mbar|inHg|abbr=on}}. The storm accelerated northeastward due to an approaching cold front.

A frontal disturbance formed over Florida along the trough, spawning an area of broad cyclonic turning. After emerging into the western Atlantic Ocean, a closed circulation developed within the system, and it is estimated that a tropical depression formed on May&nbsp;28 about 100&nbsp;mi (160&nbsp;km) east of [[Jacksonville, Florida]]. Ship observations in the region suggested that the depression intensified into a tropical storm by late on May&nbsp;28. The system was small, and was not discovered to have been a tropical cyclone until a [[Atlantic hurricane reanalysis|reanalysis]] of data in 2015. The storm moved to the northeast ahead of an approaching trough, bypassing the Carolinas to the east; rainfall brushed the coast of North Carolina. On May&nbsp;29, ship observations suggested peak winds of 50&nbsp;mph (85&nbsp;km/h). On the next day, the storm became associated with a warm front, indicating that it became extratropical to the southeast of New England.

Early the next day, a circulation formed, signaling that a tropical depression also developed over the [[Everglades]]. The system moved slowly north-northeastward, emerging into the western Atlantic Ocean at 06:00&nbsp;UTC on June&nbsp;20. Shortly thereafter, the depression intensified into a tropical storm, although the structure was broad and asymmetric due to association with a nearby [[cold-core low|upper-level low]], signaling that the system was possibly a subtropical cyclone. Ship reports in the region indicate that the storm continued to intensify. On June&nbsp;22, the structure became much more symmetrical while passing just off the Outer Banks, bringing winds of 33&nbsp;mph (54&nbsp;km/h) to [[Wilmington, North Carolina]]. That day, the Hurricane Hunters estimated winds of 80&nbsp;mph (130&nbsp;km/h), and is possible that the storm briefly attained hurricane status. The peak winds were estimated at 70&nbsp;mph (110&nbsp;km/h), due to a pressure reading of {{convert|994|mbar|inHg|abbr=on}}. The storm accelerated northeastward due to an approaching cold front. On June&nbsp;24, the storm became extratropical, and shortly thereafter made landfall along southwestern [[Nova Scotia]].

{"title_page": "Retro style", "text_new": "{{redirect|Retro}}\n{{Refimprove|date=July 2009}}\n\n'''Retro style'''  is a style that is imitative or consciously derivative of lifestyles, trends, or art forms from the historical past, including in music, modes, fashions, or attitudes. It may also be known as '''\"vintage inspired\"'''.{{cn|date=December 2018}} In [[popular culture]], the \"[[nostalgia]] cycle\" is typically for the two decades that are 20\u201330 years before the current one.\n\n==Definition==\nThe term ''retro'' has been in use since 1972 to describe<ref>Woodham 2004</ref> on the one hand, new artifacts that self-consciously refer to particular modes, motifs, techniques, and materials of the past.<ref>Dermody, Breathnach 2009, p. 7</ref> But on the other hand, many people use the term to categorize styles that have been created in the past.<ref>Baker 2012, p. 622</ref> Retro style refers to new things that display characteristics of the past. Unlike the [[Historicism (art)|historicism]] of the [[Romanticism|Romantic generations]], it is mostly the recent past that retro seeks to recapitulate, focusing on the products, fashions and artistic styles produced since the Industrial Revolution, the successive styles of [[Modernity]].<ref>Guffey 2006, p. 25</ref> The English word ''retro'' derives from the [[Latin]] prefix ''retro'', meaning backwards, or in past times.\n\nIn France, the word ''r\u00e9tro'', an abbreviation for ''r\u00e9trospectif'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnrtl.fr/lexicographie/r%C3%A9tro |title=French definition of ''r\u00e9tro'' |publisher=Cnrtl.fr |date=1978-09-11 |accessdate=2011-11-20}}</ref> gained cultural currency with reevaluations of [[Charles de Gaulle]] and France's role in [[World War II]].  The French ''mode r\u00e9tro'' of the 1970s reappraised in film and novels the conduct of French civilians during the Nazi occupation. The term ''r\u00e9tro'' was soon applied to nostalgic French fashions that recalled the same period.<ref>Walker, John. (1992) [http://www.artdesigncafe.com/retro-style-retrochic-1992 \"Retro\"]. ''Glossary of Art, Architecture & Design since 1945'', 3rd. ed.</ref>\n\nShortly thereafter ''retro'' was introduced into English by the fashion and culture press, where it suggests a rather cynical revival of older but relatively recent fashions.<ref>Elizabeth E. Guffey, ''Retro: The Culture of Revival'', pp.&nbsp;9\u201322</ref> In ''Simulacra and Simulation'', French theorist [[Jean Baudrillard]] describes ''retro'' as a demythologization of the past, distancing the present from the big ideas that drove the modern age.<ref>Baudrillard. p. 43</ref>\n\nMost commonly ''retro'' is used to describe [[Object (philosophy)|objects]] and attitudes from the recent past that no longer seem modern. It suggests a fundamental shift in the way we relate to the past. Different from more traditional forms of revivalism, \"retro\" suggests a half ironic, half longing consideration of the recent past; it has been called an \"unsentimental nostalgia\",<ref>E. Guffey 2006</ref> recalling modern forms that are no longer current. The concept of [[nostalgia]] is linked to retro, but the bittersweet desire for things, persons, and situations of the past has an ironic stance in retro style. Retro shows nostalgia with a dose of cynicism and detachment.<ref>Guffey 2006, p. 20</ref> The desire to capture something from the past and evoke nostalgia is fuelled by dissatisfaction with the present.<ref>Dermody, Breathnach 2009, p. 15</ref>\n\nRetro can be applied to several things and [[Cultural artifact|artifacts]], for example, forms of technological obsolescence (such as manual typewriters, cash registers, and bulky hand-held cellphones) and also the resurrection of old computer games and the equipment on which they are played.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\n== Specific types of retro ==\n\nSince the 1980s the implications of the word \u2018retro\u2019 have been expanding<ref>Guffey 2006, p. 16</ref> in the application to different media. Several fields have adopted the term retro from the design world. Thus next to design artifacts like objects, graphic design, fashion and interior design, \u2018retro\u2019 can be used for: music, film, art, video games, architecture, television and food. \nSometimes, it can also suggest an entire outlook on life (describing especially forms of social conservatism like homeschooling or the embrace of traditional gender roles).\n\n=== Objects ===\nUp until the 1960s, interiors were often decorated with [[antique]]s. During the 1960s in London, shops started selling pieces of second-hand furniture. These shops were different from the previous antique shops because they sold daily life objects from the recent past. These objects used to be seen as junk: Victorian enamel signs, stuffed bears, old furniture painted with union jacks, bowler hats etc. A new way of producing and consuming the past emerged and a broader range of objects from the recent past was used for new designs.<ref>Baker 2012, p. 624</ref>\n\nBefore the word \u2018retro\u2019 came into use in the 1970s, the practice of adopting old styles for new designs was already common. Throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, designers borrowed from the past, for example, classicistic style.<ref>Dermody, Breathnach 2009, p. 7</ref> The difference is that since the 1960s people started to refer to the recent past.\n\nIn the 1980s, design history emerged as a discipline and several histories of design were published. The access to these overviews and the ability to experiment with computer design programs has caused an increase of retro designed objects in the last decades.<ref>Dermody and Breathnach 2009, p. 11</ref>\n\n=== Interior design ===\n[[File:Poland. Gmina Raszyn. Janki 004.JPG|thumb|Retro lamp by [[IKEA]], referring to the 1970s]]\n[[Interior design]] magazines often show retro style as an interior decoration of mixed styles and objects from the past, second hand and new. For example, 1970s patterned wallpapers, combined with second-hand furniture also from the 1970s, the 1960s or 1950s. The value of old artifact has increased because the object used to be considered old-fashioned and every day.<ref>Baker 2012, p. 622</ref> In this case \u2018retro\u2019 indicates a value and that is also partly why today\u2019s retailers produce new objects in an old style.\n\n=== Graphic design, typography, and packaging ===\nIn [[graphic design]] too, long before the use of the word \u2018retro\u2019, referencing to earlier graphic characteristics was done. [[William Morris]] can be seen as an example, for i.a. book design he adopted Medieval production and stylistic models in 1891.<ref>Dermody, Breathnach 2009, pp. 7\u20138</ref> Furthermore, in the beginning of the twentieth century, Gothic, Baroque and Rococo motifs were used for new products.<ref>Heller and Lasky, 1993</ref> In [[typography]] [[classicism]] has always been an influence and throughout the 20th century, early woodcut printing too. The introduction of the technique of photocomposition to typesetting in the 1960s allowed typographers greater flexibility in the selection and arrangement of type styles and sizes. For example, psychedelic typefaces were developed gaining inspiration from Art Nouveau and other cultures.<ref>Dermody, Breathnach 2009, pp. 8-10</ref> Historicist styles are also used is in the promotion and [[Packaging and labeling|packaging]] of food and household products, referring to childhood memories and domestic nostalgic ideals.<ref>Dermody, Breathnach 2009, p. 16</ref>\n\n=== Fashion design ===\n[[File:Karlie Kloss at Anna Sui 2011.jpg|thumb|left|A 1940s retro-style dress with turban, designed in a modern electric blue, modeled by [[Karlie Kloss]] at a 2011 [[Anna Sui]] show]] \nThe terms \"retro fashion\" and \"vintage fashion\" are sometimes used interchangeably and therefore can cause confusion as to what is really meant.  The term \"retro fashion\" (also known as \"vintage inspired\") refers to new clothing, shoes, and accessories that are designed to resemble clothing, shoes, and accessories that are at least 13 years old or older. \"Vintage fashion\" (or \"vintage clothing\") refers to the original (old) clothing the new designs are based on.  So in simple terms, new clothes that look old are called \"retro\" and clothes that look old because they ''are'' old are called \"vintage\".\n\nAn example of retro fashion is 1970s and 1980s sportswear; soccer jackets, jerseys, and T-shirts with former logos of the soccer associations are very popular; their designs commonly remember the old days by using lines in the sides and combinations of colors characteristic of those times. A specific case is the [[1970 FIFA World Cup]] held in Mexico. Its logo and font type are used in a variety of retro sports garments. Brands such as [[Adidas]], [[Puma AG|Puma]] and [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] have their own divisions specialized in retro products. Some soccer, baseball and basketball clubs also have re-edited their former garments to raise their sales. See also [[Throwback uniform]].\n\nIn the early 2010s, there was a revival of pastel and neon colors, stereotypically associated with 1980s and early 1990s fashion (with the 1980s pastel revival itself actually being a rebirth of a 1950s trend). Also in the early 2010s, late 1980s style high waisted [[mom jeans]] made a comeback with female [[Hipster (contemporary subculture)|hipsters]].  Nowadays, 1990s fashion has made a comeback, many of the fabrics and patterns ubiquitous to the decade (such as crushed velvet and floral) are popular now in the 2010s. [[Dr. Martens]], a shoe brand popular in the 1990s has also made a strong comeback in the early 2010s. 2011\u201312 was the British company's best selling season of all time.<ref>{{cite web|author=Lauren Cochrane |url=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2012/jul/19/dr-martens-comeback-best-selling |title=Dr Martens enjoy comeback with best-selling season ever &#124; Fashion |publisher=The Guardian |date= |accessdate=2014-01-05}}</ref>\n\nWhen an older style of [[athletic shoe]] is manufactured again by a shoe company years or decades later it is referred to as a \"reissue\".\n\n=== Retro art ===\n[[File:CAP On the Air Force Team poster.jpg|thumb|right|A 1950s-era poster in pop-art style, the style on which retro art is based]]\n\nThe style now called \"'''retro art'''\" is a genre of [[pop art]] which was developed in the 1940s and 1950s, in response to a need for bold, eye-catching graphics that were easy to reproduce on simple [[Printing press|presses]] available at the time in major centres.  '''Retro advertising art''' has experienced a resurgence in popularity since its style is distinctive from modern computer-generated styling. Contemporary artist [[Anne Taintor]] uses retro advertising art as the centerpiece for her ongoing commentary on the modern woman. Specific styling features include analog machine design, vintage [[television program]] etc.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bluerectangle.com/book_reviews/book_review/bookulating_Suggest-O-Mometer/index.html|title=''Bookulating Suggest-O-Mometer''|accessdate=2011-10-05|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201093233/http://bluerectangle.com/book_reviews/book_review/bookulating_Suggest-O-Mometer/index.html|archivedate=2008-12-01}}</ref>\n\nPerhaps the most famous example of a retro pop-art character is the more generalized form of the [[Ward Cleaver]]-styled [[J. R. \"Bob\" Dobbs]]-esque icon which has been widely played off, copied, and parodied.\n\n=== Media and culture ===\n\n==== Film, music, fashion, and television ====\nThe 1970s and 1980s brought about a 1950s\u2013early '60s revival with films and television shows such as ''[[American Graffiti]]'', ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'', ''[[Grease (film)|Grease]]'', ''[[Happy Days]]'', ''[[The Outsiders (film)|The Outsiders]]'', ''[[Stand By Me (film)|Stand By Me]]'', and ''[[Back to the Future]]'' being set in this time period. There was also the [[rockabilly]] revival, the revival of [[sock hop]] school dances, [[Sha Na Na]] parodying the [[doo-wop]] of the 1950s, the [[Beach Boys]] becoming a nostalgia act after the success of their ''[[Endless Summer (Beach Boys album)|Endless Summer]]'' compilation, the 1950s [[greaser (subculture)|greaser]] look greatly influencing the [[punk subculture]], and [[Billy Joel]] paying homage to 1950s doo-wop on his album ''[[An Innocent Man]]''.\n\nThe 1980s and 1990s witnessed a 1960s revival with ''[[Hairspray (1988 film)|Hairspray]]'', ''[[Grease 2]]'', ''[[Mermaids (1990 film)|Mermaids]]'', ''[[Matinee (1993 film)|Matinee]]'', ''[[That Thing You Do!]]'', ''[[Forrest Gump]]'' (in which the first part of this film took place in the '60s), ''[[Shag (film)|Shag]]'', ''[[The Wonder Years]]'', ''[[The Sandlot]]'', ''[[Austin Powers]]'', a revival of the cartoon series ''[[The Jetsons]]'' with new episodes and a [[Jetsons: The Movie|movie]], the [[power pop]] of the decade being influenced by 1960s pop rock, the [[garage rock revival]] (with bands like [[The Cynics]]), [[The Monkees]] making a resurgence in 1986, and 1960s hits covered by various artists. Examples of such covers are \"[[You Keep Me Hangin' On]]\" by [[Kim Wilde]], \"[[Where Did Our Love Go?]]\" and \"[[Tainted Love]]\" by [[Soft Cell]], \"[[Spirit in the Sky]]\" by [[Doctor and the Medics]], \"[[Harlem Shuffle]]\" by [[The Rolling Stones]], \"[[Dancing in the Street]]\" by [[David Bowie]] and [[Mick Jagger]], \"[[The Shoop Shoop Song (It's in His Kiss)]]\" by [[Cher]], and \"[[The Lion Sleeps Tonight]]\" by [[Tight Fit]]. The [[British Invasion]], [[Swinging London]], and [[mod (subculture)|mod]] subcultures of the mid-1960s influenced the [[punk rock]], [[mod revival]], [[new wave]], and [[post-punk]] of the late 1970s\u20131980s, as well as the [[Britpop]] movement of the mid-1990s. The [[Woodstock]] festival of 1969 was also celebrated with [[Woodstock '89|Woodstocks '89]], [[Woodstock '94|'94]], and [[Woodstock '99|'99]].\n\nThe 1990s and 2000s brought a 1970s revival. The films ''[[Dazed and Confused (film)|Dazed and Confused]]'', ''[[Detroit Rock City (film)|Detroit Rock City]]'', ''[[Casino (film)|Casino]]'', ''[[The Stoned Age]]'', ''[[The Brady Bunch Movie]]'' and its [[A Very Brady Sequel|sequel]] (both of which were remakes of the popular early '70s TV show ''[[The Brady Bunch]]''), ''Forrest Gump'' (in which the second part of this film took place in the '70s), and ''[[Boogie Nights]]'' (in which the first part of this film took place in the late '70s) were released, along with a revival of 1970s [[disco]] and [[Pop music|pop]] led by artists such as the [[A*Teens]], the [[Spice Girls]], and [[Jamiroquai]]; [[Lenny Kravitz]]'s \"[[It Ain't Over 'Til It's Over]]\" being inspired by [[Earth, Wind and Fire]] and [[Philly soul]]; a revival of [[sideburns]], [[bell bottoms]], and [[afro]] (worn by Kravitz); the debut of the television series ''[[That '70s Show]]''; and 1970s hits covered by various artists. Examples of such covers are \"[[I Can See Clearly Now]]\" by [[Jimmy Cliff]], \"[[Baby I Love Your Way]]\" by [[Big Mountain (band)|Big Mountain]], \"[[Turn the Beat Around]]\" by [[Gloria Estefan]], \"[[Wild World (song)|Wild World]]\" by [[Mr. Big (American band)|Mr. Big]], \"[[O-o-h Child]]\" by [[Dino (singer)|Dino]], \"[[Wild Night]]\" by [[John Mellencamp]] and [[Meshell Ndegeocello]], \"[[Oh Girl]]\" by [[Paul Young]], \"[[Easy (Commodores song)|Easy]]\" by [[Faith No More]], \"[[Have You Seen Her]]\" by [[MC Hammer]], \"[[Emotion (Samantha Sang song)|Emotion]]\" by the [[Bee Gees]], \"[[Killing Me Softly with His Song]]\" by [[Fugees]], \"[[Love Rollercoaster]]\" by [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]], and \"[[It Only Takes a Minute]]\" by [[Take That]]. Samples of 1970s songs were also used in hip-hop songs in the 1990s and 2000s, most notably in the 1990s hip-hop genre [[G-funk]] and in songs such as \"[[Gangsta's Paradise]]\" by [[Coolio]]. There was also the [[garage rock]] revival in the early 2000s with bands such as [[The Strokes]], [[Jet (band)|Jet]], and [[The White Stripes]].\n\nThe late 1990s began the 1980s revival, which grew into the 2000s and 2010s. 1980s-themed films and television shows such as ''[[Grosse Pointe Blank]]'', ''[[The Wedding Singer]]'', ''[[Boogie Nights]]'' (the second part of this film took place in the early '80s), ''[[Romy and Michele's High School Reunion]]'', ''[[Wet Hot American Summer]]'', ''[[That '80s Show]]'', and ''[[Freaks and Geeks]]'' were released in the late 1990s\u20132000s. ''[[I Love the '80s (U.S. TV series)|I Love the '80s]]'', part of a [[VH1]] series of decade retrospectives, became the most popular of the series and spawned two sequel series. This craze also brought about revivals such as [[Michael Bay]]'s ''[[Transformers (2007 film)|Transformers]]'' and ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2014 film)|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'' films, ''[[Masters of the Universe vs. The Snake Men]]'', ''[[G.I. Joe: Resolute]]'', and ''[[Voltron: Legendary Defender]]''. The [[post-punk revival]] took place in the early 2000s, with bands such as [[Franz Ferdinand (band)|Franz Ferdinand]] and [[The Killers]]. [[Glam metal|Hair metal]] also experienced a brief resurgence during this time with [[Bon Jovi]]'s \"[[It's My Life (Bon Jovi song)|It's My Life]]\", the ''[[Monster Ballads]]'' compilation, and VH1's [[Rock Never Stops Tour]]. The 2002 video game ''[[Grand Theft Auto: Vice City]]'' helped popularize 1980s aesthetics and music among younger generations. The 1980s-oriented television shows ''[[The Goldbergs (2013 TV series)|The Goldbergs]]'', ''[[The Carrie Diaries (TV series)|The Carrie Diaries]]'', ''[[Moonbeam City]]'', ''[[GLOW (TV series)|GLOW]]'', and ''[[Stranger Things]]'' were released in 2010s, as well as the films ''[[Drive (2011 film)|Drive]]'', ''[[Everybody Wants Some]]'', ''[[It (2017 film)|It]]'', ''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]'', ''[[Wonder Woman 1984]]'', ''[[Kung Fury]]'', and ''[[Ready Player One (film)|Ready Player One]]''. A trend for 1980s second-wave synthpop grew at this time along with 1990s-style future house and nu-disco songs by such artists as [[Katy Perry]], [[Justin Timberlake]], and [[Bruno Mars]]; 1980s-influenced songs include \"[[Shut Up and Dance (Walk the Moon song)|Shut Up and Dance]]\" by [[Walk the Moon]], \"[[24K Magic (song)|24K Magic]]\" by Bruno Mars, and \"[[Uptown Funk]]\" by [[Mark Ronson]] featuring Bruno Mars. Numerous 1980s television shows and movies were revived, such as ''[[Footloose (1984 film)|Footloose]]'', ''[[Ghostbusters (1984 film)|Ghostbusters]]'', ''[[Adventures in Babysitting]]'', and ''[[Dirty Dancing (1987 film)|Dirty Dancing]]''. In the 2010s, musical genres/subcultures such as [[vaporwave]], [[synthwave]], [[outrun]], [[retrowave]], and [[lo-fi music]] emerged that mimicked the aesthetics of the 1980s and 1990s; for example, palm trees on a neon galaxy grid background, or [[VHS]] scanlines. The [[Internet]] has aided in the celebration of nostalgia through the creation of these subcultures that mimic the past, oftentimes from people who were born after these decades had ended.\n\nThe 2010s and 2020s have seen a revival of the 1990s\u2013early 2000s. In 2011, TV channel [[Nickelodeon]] established the [[NickSplat]] (formerly The '90s Are All That) block on its [[TeenNick]] station featuring reruns of 1990s Nickelodeon programs, accompanied by much fanfare on [[social media]]. In the early-mid 2010s, \"Only '90s kids will remember\" [[meme]]s were popular online, as well as [[Buzzfeed]] \"'90s kid\" quizzes. There have been revivals of '90s\u2013early 2000s television series such as ''[[Hey Arnold!]]'', ''[[Carmen Sandiego]]'', ''[[The X-Files]]'', ''[[Fuller House (TV series)|Fuller House]]'', ''[[Girl Meets World]]'', ''[[Rocko's Modern Life]]'', ''[[Animaniacs]]'', ''[[The Proud Family]]'', ''[[Arrested Development (TV series)|Arrested Development]]'', ''[[Teen Titans Go!]]'', ''[[The Powerpuff Girls (2016 TV series)|The Powerpuff Girls]]'', ''[[Kim Possible]]'', ''[[Invader Zim]]'', ''[[Lizzie McGuire]]'', ''[[Raven's Home]]'', ''[[Prison Break]]'', and ''[[Samurai Jack]]''. There have also been sequels/reboots to '90s\u2013early 2000s films such as ''[[Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle]]'', ''[[Space Jam 2]]'', ''[[Jurassic World]]'', ''[[Beauty and the Beast (2017 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'', ''[[Aladdin (2019 film)|Aladdin]]'', ''[[The Lion King (2019 film)|The Lion King]]'', ''[[Mulan (2020 film)|Mulan]]'', ''[[Finding Dory]]'', and ''[[The Incredibles 2]]'', as well as adaptations of '90s\u2013early 2000s franchises such as ''[[Goosebumps (film)|Goosebumps]]'', ''[[Artemis Fowl (film)|Artemis Fowl]]'', ''[[Power Rangers (film)|Power Rangers]]'', ''[[A Series of Unfortunate Events (TV series)|A Series of Unfortunate Events]]'', and ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (film)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]''. Television series and movies set in the 1990s or early 2000s such as ''[[Captain Marvel (2019 film)|Captain Marvel]]'', ''[[Everything Sucks!]]'', ''[[Fresh Off the Boat]]'', ''[[Hindsight (TV series)|Hindsight]]'', ''[[Mid90s]]'', ''[[Lady Bird (film)|Lady Bird]]'', and ''[[Pen15]]'' have been released. [[New jack swing]] briefly came back in style in 2018 with \"[[Finesse (song)|Finesse]]\" by Bruno Mars featuring [[Cardi B]], with a [[music video]] inspired by ''[[In Living Color]]''. The 2018 song \"[[1999 (Charli XCX and Troye Sivan song)|1999]]\" by [[Charli XCX]] and [[Troye Sivan]] paid tribute to the pop culture of the late 1990s and the \"Y2K aesthetic\". There was also an ''[[I Love the '90s (U.S. TV series)|I Love the '90s]]'' series that was released in the mid-2000s. The ''[[Pok\u00e9mon]]'' franchise, which was at its peak popularity in the late 1990s, experienced a second-wave Pokemania during summer 2016 with ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Go]]''; the theme song to the original ''[[Pok\u00e9mon (anime)|Pok\u00e9mon]]'' anime briefly became one of the most downloaded songs on [[iTunes]] and [[Spotify]] at this time. The [[Tamagotchi]], originally popular in the '90s\u2013early 2000s, became a hot seller during [[Christmas]] seasons in the 2010s. Discontinued 1990s\u2013early 2000s snacks and drinks such as [[Surge (soda)|Surge]], [[Crystal Pepsi]], [[Dunk-a-roos]], [[Doritos|3D Doritos]], and [[Sprite Remix]] have been re-released.\n\n==== Retrogaming ====\n{{Main|Retrogaming}}\nRetrogaming is a pastime which is becoming increasingly popular where individuals play [[video game]]s on vintage computers or vintage game [[video game console|consoles]]. What constitutes a vintage or retro machine is sometimes open to debate, but typically, most retro gamers are interested in [[Commodore 64]], [[Amiga 500]], [[Atari 2600]], [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]], [[Sega Genesis|Sega Genesis/Mega Drive]], [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]], [[Nintendo 64]], [[Dreamcast]], [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|SNES]], and classic [[Game Boy]] games and consoles.  [[Console emulation|Emulation]] often plays a part in retrogaming if the original hardware is unavailable.\n\n==== Retro erotica (photography) ====\nRetro [[erotica]] is usually [[photography]] in the style of [[Pin-up girl|pinups]] or [[pornography]] typically dating from the 1970s or earlier. It ranges from hardcore to non-nude pinup style photography, often featuring [[lingerie]] such as [[girdle]]s, bullet [[Brassiere|bras]] and [[garter belts]] and [[hosiery]] with hairstyles, makeup, and props fashioned after those periods. Some aficionados distinguish retro (modern photography in an older style) from vintage (actual period photos or film) while others conflate the two as either retro or vintage. There are a number of websites dedicated to both types.\n\n=== Aircraft ===\n[[Image:Qantas Boeing 737-800 (VH-XZP) retrojet.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Qantas]] [[Boeing 737-800]] (VH-XZP) retrojet seen at [[Sydney Airport]] ]]\nA handful of [[airline]]s have chosen to paint a historical [[aircraft livery|livery]] on a single selected [[aircraft]] in their modern fleet, typically as a marketing device or to commemorate an anniversary.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Flynn|first1=David|title=Qantas reveals 'flying kangaroo' livery on Boeing 737|url=http://www.ausbt.com.au/qantas-to-unveil-retro-livery-on-boeing-737|accessdate=31 May 2015|date=17 November 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Mutzabaugh|first1=Ben|title=Happy 85th: LOT adds 'RetroJET' livery to Embraer E175|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/todayinthesky/2014/04/18/happy-85th-lot-adds-retrojet-livery-to-embraer-e175/7865801/|accessdate=31 May 2015|work=USA Today|date=18 April 2014}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Flat design]]\n* [[Kitsch]]\n* [[Irony]]\n* [[Minimalism]]\n* [[Nostalgia]]\n* [[Old school (disambiguation)|Old school]]\n* [[Ostalgie]]\n* [[Period piece]]\n* [[Retrofuturism]]\n* [[Retrotronics]]\n* [[Retro-style automobile]]\n* [[Rockabilly]]\n* [[Self-parody]]\n* [[Steampunk]]\n* [[Throwback uniform]]\n* [[Tiki culture]]\n* [[Vintage clothing]]\n* [[Vintage (design)]]\n* [[List of retro style video game consoles]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n== References ==\n* {{cite book |last= Baudrillard |first= Jean |authorlink= Jean Baudrillard |year= 1995 |title= Simulacra and Simulation |location= Ann Arbor |publisher= University of Michigan Press |isbn= 978-0-472-06521-9 |url= https://archive.org/details/simulacrasimula000baud }}\n* {{cite book |last= Collins |first= James C |authorlink= James C.

It may also be known as '''\"vintage inspired\"'''.{{cn|date=December 2018}} In [[popular culture]], the \"[[nostalgia]] cycle\" is typically for the two decades that are 20\u201330 years before the current one.\n\n==Definition==\nThe term ''retro'' has been in use since 1972 to describe<ref>Woodham 2004</ref> on the one hand, new artifacts that self-consciously refer to particular modes, motifs, techniques, and materials of the past.<ref>Dermody, Breathnach 2009, p. 7</ref> But on the other hand, many people use the term to categorize styles that have been created in the past.<ref>Baker 2012, p. 622</ref> Retro style refers to new things that display characteristics of the past. Unlike the [[Historicism (art)|historicism]] of the [[Romanticism|Romantic generations]], it is mostly the recent past that retro seeks to recapitulate, focusing on the products, fashions and artistic styles produced since the Industrial Revolution, the successive styles of [[Modernity]].<ref>Guffey 2006, p. 25</ref> The English word ''retro'' derives from the [[Latin]] prefix ''retro'', meaning backwards, or in past times.\n\nIn France, the word ''r\u00e9tro'', an abbreviation for ''r\u00e9trospectif'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnrtl.fr/lexicographie/r%C3%A9tro |title=French definition of ''r\u00e9tro'' |publisher=Cnrtl.fr |date=1978-09-11 |accessdate=2011-11-20}}</ref> gained cultural currency with reevaluations of [[Charles de Gaulle]] and France's role in [[World War II]].  The French ''mode r\u00e9tro'' of the 1970s reappraised in film and novels the conduct of French civilians during the Nazi occupation. The term ''r\u00e9tro'' was soon applied to nostalgic French fashions that recalled the same period.<ref>Walker, John. (1992) [http://www.artdesigncafe.com/retro-style-retrochic-1992 \"Retro\"]. ''Glossary of Art, Architecture & Design since 1945'', 3rd. ed.</ref>\n\nShortly thereafter ''retro'' was introduced into English by the fashion and culture press, where it suggests a rather cynical revival of older but relatively recent fashions.<ref>Elizabeth E. Guffey, ''Retro: The Culture of Revival'', pp.&nbsp;9\u201322</ref> In ''Simulacra and Simulation'', French theorist [[Jean Baudrillard]] describes ''retro'' as a demythologization of the past, distancing the present from the big ideas that drove the modern age.<ref>Baudrillard. p. 43</ref>\n\nMost commonly ''retro'' is used to describe [[Object (philosophy)|objects]] and attitudes from the recent past that no longer seem modern. It suggests a fundamental shift in the way we relate to the past. Different from more traditional forms of revivalism, \"retro\" suggests a half ironic, half longing consideration of the recent past; it has been called an \"unsentimental nostalgia\",<ref>E. Guffey 2006</ref> recalling modern forms that are no longer current. The concept of [[nostalgia]] is linked to retro, but the bittersweet desire for things, persons, and situations of the past has an ironic stance in retro style. Retro shows nostalgia with a dose of cynicism and detachment.<ref>Guffey 2006, p. 20</ref> The desire to capture something from the past and evoke nostalgia is fuelled by dissatisfaction with the present.<ref>Dermody, Breathnach 2009, p. 15</ref>\n\nRetro can be applied to several things and [[Cultural artifact|artifacts]], for example, forms of technological obsolescence (such as manual typewriters, cash registers, and bulky hand-held cellphones) and also the resurrection of old computer games and the equipment on which they are played.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\n== Specific types of retro ==\n\nSince the 1980s the implications of the word \u2018retro\u2019 have been expanding<ref>Guffey 2006, p. 16</ref> in the application to different media. Several fields have adopted the term retro from the design world. Thus next to design artifacts like objects, graphic design, fashion and interior design, \u2018retro\u2019 can be used for: music, film, art, video games, architecture, television and food. \nSometimes, it can also suggest an entire outlook on life (describing especially forms of social conservatism like homeschooling or the embrace of traditional gender roles).\n\n=== Objects ===\nUp until the 1960s, interiors were often decorated with [[antique]]s. During the 1960s in London, shops started selling pieces of second-hand furniture. These shops were different from the previous antique shops because they sold daily life objects from the recent past. These objects used to be seen as junk: Victorian enamel signs, stuffed bears, old furniture painted with union jacks, bowler hats etc. A new way of producing and consuming the past emerged and a broader range of objects from the recent past was used for new designs.<ref>Baker 2012, p. 624</ref>\n\nBefore the word \u2018retro\u2019 came into use in the 1970s, the practice of adopting old styles for new designs was already common. Throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, designers borrowed from the past, for example, classicistic style.<ref>Dermody, Breathnach 2009, p. 7</ref> The difference is that since the 1960s people started to refer to the recent past.\n\nIn the 1980s, design history emerged as a discipline and several histories of design were published. The access to these overviews and the ability to experiment with computer design programs has caused an increase of retro designed objects in the last decades.<ref>Dermody and Breathnach 2009, p. 11</ref>\n\n=== Interior design ===\n[[File:Poland. Gmina Raszyn. Janki 004.JPG|thumb|Retro lamp by [[IKEA]], referring to the 1970s]]\n[[Interior design]] magazines often show retro style as an interior decoration of mixed styles and objects from the past, second hand and new. For example, 1970s patterned wallpapers, combined with second-hand furniture also from the 1970s, the 1960s or 1950s. The value of old artifact has increased because the object used to be considered old-fashioned and every day.<ref>Baker 2012, p. 622</ref> In this case \u2018retro\u2019 indicates a value and that is also partly why today\u2019s retailers produce new objects in an old style.\n\n=== Graphic design, typography, and packaging ===\nIn [[graphic design]] too, long before the use of the word \u2018retro\u2019, referencing to earlier graphic characteristics was done. [[William Morris]] can be seen as an example, for i.a. book design he adopted Medieval production and stylistic models in 1891.<ref>Dermody, Breathnach 2009, pp. 7\u20138</ref> Furthermore, in the beginning of the twentieth century, Gothic, Baroque and Rococo motifs were used for new products.<ref>Heller and Lasky, 1993</ref> In [[typography]] [[classicism]] has always been an influence and throughout the 20th century, early woodcut printing too. The introduction of the technique of photocomposition to typesetting in the 1960s allowed typographers greater flexibility in the selection and arrangement of type styles and sizes. For example, psychedelic typefaces were developed gaining inspiration from Art Nouveau and other cultures.<ref>Dermody, Breathnach 2009, pp. 8-10</ref> Historicist styles are also used is in the promotion and [[Packaging and labeling|packaging]] of food and household products, referring to childhood memories and domestic nostalgic ideals.<ref>Dermody, Breathnach 2009, p. 16</ref>\n\n=== Fashion design ===\n[[File:Karlie Kloss at Anna Sui 2011.jpg|thumb|left|A 1940s retro-style dress with turban, designed in a modern electric blue, modeled by [[Karlie Kloss]] at a 2011 [[Anna Sui]] show]] \nThe terms \"retro fashion\" and \"vintage fashion\" are sometimes used interchangeably and therefore can cause confusion as to what is really meant.  The term \"retro fashion\" (also known as \"vintage inspired\") refers to new clothing, shoes, and accessories that are designed to resemble clothing, shoes, and accessories that are at least 13 years old or older. \"Vintage fashion\" (or \"vintage clothing\") refers to the original (old) clothing the new designs are based on.  So in simple terms, new clothes that look old are called \"retro\" and clothes that look old because they ''are'' old are called \"vintage\".\n\nAn example of retro fashion is 1970s and 1980s sportswear; soccer jackets, jerseys, and T-shirts with former logos of the soccer associations are very popular; their designs commonly remember the old days by using lines in the sides and combinations of colors characteristic of those times. A specific case is the [[1970 FIFA World Cup]] held in Mexico. Its logo and font type are used in a variety of retro sports garments. Brands such as [[Adidas]], [[Puma AG|Puma]] and [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] have their own divisions specialized in retro products. Some soccer, baseball and basketball clubs also have re-edited their former garments to raise their sales. See also [[Throwback uniform]].\n\nIn the early 2010s, there was a revival of pastel and neon colors, stereotypically associated with 1980s and early 1990s fashion (with the 1980s pastel revival itself actually being a rebirth of a 1950s trend). Also in the early 2010s, late 1980s style high waisted [[mom jeans]] made a comeback with female [[Hipster (contemporary subculture)|hipsters]].  Nowadays, 1990s fashion has made a comeback, many of the fabrics and patterns ubiquitous to the decade (such as crushed velvet and floral) are popular now in the 2010s. [[Dr. Martens]], a shoe brand popular in the 1990s has also made a strong comeback in the early 2010s. 2011\u201312 was the British company's best selling season of all time.<ref>{{cite web|author=Lauren Cochrane |url=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2012/jul/19/dr-martens-comeback-best-selling |title=Dr Martens enjoy comeback with best-selling season ever &#124; Fashion |publisher=The Guardian |date= |accessdate=2014-01-05}}</ref>\n\nWhen an older style of [[athletic shoe]] is manufactured again by a shoe company years or decades later it is referred to as a \"reissue\".\n\n=== Retro art ===\n[[File:CAP On the Air Force Team poster.jpg|thumb|right|A 1950s-era poster in pop-art style, the style on which retro art is based]]\n\nThe style now called \"'''retro art'''\" is a genre of [[pop art]] which was developed in the 1940s and 1950s, in response to a need for bold, eye-catching graphics that were easy to reproduce on simple [[Printing press|presses]] available at the time in major centres.  '''Retro advertising art''' has experienced a resurgence in popularity since its style is distinctive from modern computer-generated styling. Contemporary artist [[Anne Taintor]] uses retro advertising art as the centerpiece for her ongoing commentary on the modern woman. Specific styling features include analog machine design, vintage [[television program]] etc.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bluerectangle.com/book_reviews/book_review/bookulating_Suggest-O-Mometer/index.html|title=''Bookulating Suggest-O-Mometer''|accessdate=2011-10-05|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201093233/http://bluerectangle.com/book_reviews/book_review/bookulating_Suggest-O-Mometer/index.html|archivedate=2008-12-01}}</ref>\n\nPerhaps the most famous example of a retro pop-art character is the more generalized form of the [[Ward Cleaver]]-styled [[J. R. \"Bob\" Dobbs]]-esque icon which has been widely played off, copied, and parodied.\n\n=== Media and culture ===\n\n==== Film, music, fashion, and television ====\nThe 1970s and 1980s brought about a 1950s\u2013early '60s revival with films and television shows such as ''[[American Graffiti]]'', ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'', ''[[Grease (film)|Grease]]'', ''[[Happy Days]]'', ''[[The Outsiders (film)|The Outsiders]]'', ''[[Stand By Me (film)|Stand By Me]]'', and ''[[Back to the Future]]'' being set in this time period. There was also the [[rockabilly]] revival, the revival of [[sock hop]] school dances, [[Sha Na Na]] parodying the [[doo-wop]] of the 1950s, the [[Beach Boys]] becoming a nostalgia act after the success of their ''[[Endless Summer (Beach Boys album)|Endless Summer]]'' compilation, the 1950s [[greaser (subculture)|greaser]] look greatly influencing the [[punk subculture]], and [[Billy Joel]] paying homage to 1950s doo-wop on his album ''[[An Innocent Man]]''.\n\nThe 1980s and 1990s witnessed a 1960s revival with ''[[Hairspray (1988 film)|Hairspray]]'', ''[[Grease 2]]'', ''[[Mermaids (1990 film)|Mermaids]]'', ''[[Matinee (1993 film)|Matinee]]'', ''[[That Thing You Do!]]'', ''[[Forrest Gump]]'' (in which the first part of this film took place in the '60s), ''[[Shag (film)|Shag]]'', ''[[The Wonder Years]]'', ''[[The Sandlot]]'', ''[[Austin Powers]]'', a revival of the cartoon series ''[[The Jetsons]]'' with new episodes and a [[Jetsons: The Movie|movie]], the [[power pop]] of the decade being influenced by 1960s pop rock, the [[garage rock revival]] (with bands like [[The Cynics]]), [[The Monkees]] making a resurgence in 1986, and 1960s hits covered by various artists. Examples of such covers are \"[[You Keep Me Hangin' On]]\" by [[Kim Wilde]], \"[[Where Did Our Love Go?]]\" and \"[[Tainted Love]]\" by [[Soft Cell]], \"[[Spirit in the Sky]]\" by [[Doctor and the Medics]], \"[[Harlem Shuffle]]\" by [[The Rolling Stones]], \"[[Dancing in the Street]]\" by [[David Bowie]] and [[Mick Jagger]], \"[[The Shoop Shoop Song (It's in His Kiss)]]\" by [[Cher]], and \"[[The Lion Sleeps Tonight]]\" by [[Tight Fit]]. The [[British Invasion]], [[Swinging London]], and [[mod (subculture)|mod]] subcultures of the mid-1960s influenced the [[punk rock]], [[mod revival]], [[new wave]], and [[post-punk]] of the late 1970s\u20131980s, as well as the [[Britpop]] movement of the mid-1990s. The [[Woodstock]] festival of 1969 was also celebrated with [[Woodstock '89|Woodstocks '89]], [[Woodstock '94|'94]], and [[Woodstock '99|'99]].\n\nThe 1990s and 2000s brought a 1970s revival. The films ''[[Dazed and Confused (film)|Dazed and Confused]]'', ''[[Detroit Rock City (film)|Detroit Rock City]]'', ''[[Casino (film)|Casino]]'', ''[[The Stoned Age]]'', ''[[The Brady Bunch Movie]]'' and its [[A Very Brady Sequel|sequel]] (both of which were remakes of the popular early '70s TV show ''[[The Brady Bunch]]''), ''Forrest Gump'' (in which the second part of this film took place in the '70s), and ''[[Boogie Nights]]'' (in which the first part of this film took place in the late '70s) were released, along with a revival of 1970s [[disco]] and [[Pop music|pop]] led by artists such as the [[A*Teens]], the [[Spice Girls]], and [[Jamiroquai]]; [[Lenny Kravitz]]'s \"[[It Ain't Over 'Til It's Over]]\" being inspired by [[Earth, Wind and Fire]] and [[Philly soul]]; a revival of [[sideburns]], [[bell bottoms]], and [[afro]] (worn by Kravitz); the debut of the television series ''[[That '70s Show]]''; and 1970s hits covered by various artists. Examples of such covers are \"[[I Can See Clearly Now]]\" by [[Jimmy Cliff]], \"[[Baby I Love Your Way]]\" by [[Big Mountain (band)|Big Mountain]], \"[[Turn the Beat Around]]\" by [[Gloria Estefan]], \"[[Wild World (song)|Wild World]]\" by [[Mr. Big (American band)|Mr. Big]], \"[[O-o-h Child]]\" by [[Dino (singer)|Dino]], \"[[Wild Night]]\" by [[John Mellencamp]] and [[Meshell Ndegeocello]], \"[[Oh Girl]]\" by [[Paul Young]], \"[[Easy (Commodores song)|Easy]]\" by [[Faith No More]], \"[[Have You Seen Her]]\" by [[MC Hammer]], \"[[Emotion (Samantha Sang song)|Emotion]]\" by the [[Bee Gees]], \"[[Killing Me Softly with His Song]]\" by [[Fugees]], \"[[Love Rollercoaster]]\" by [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]], and \"[[It Only Takes a Minute]]\" by [[Take That]]. Samples of 1970s songs were also used in hip-hop songs in the 1990s and 2000s, most notably in the 1990s hip-hop genre [[G-funk]] and in songs such as \"[[Gangsta's Paradise]]\" by [[Coolio]]. There was also the [[garage rock]] revival in the early 2000s with bands such as [[The Strokes]], [[Jet (band)|Jet]], and [[The White Stripes]].\n\nThe late 1990s began the 1980s revival, which grew into the 2000s and 2010s. 1980s-themed films and television shows such as ''[[Grosse Pointe Blank]]'', ''[[The Wedding Singer]]'', ''[[Boogie Nights]]'' (the second part of this film took place in the early '80s), ''[[Romy and Michele's High School Reunion]]'', ''[[Wet Hot American Summer]]'', ''[[That '80s Show]]'', and ''[[Freaks and Geeks]]'' were released in the late 1990s\u20132000s. ''[[I Love the '80s (U.S. TV series)|I Love the '80s]]'', part of a [[VH1]] series of decade retrospectives, became the most popular of the series and spawned two sequel series. This craze also brought about revivals such as [[Michael Bay]]'s ''[[Transformers (2007 film)|Transformers]]'' and ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2014 film)|Teenage and Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'' films, ''[[Masters of the Universe vs. The Snake Men]]'', ''[[G.I. Joe: Resolute]]'', and ''[[Voltron: Legendary Defender]]''. The [[post-punk revival]] took place in the early 2000s, with bands such as [[Franz Ferdinand (band)|Franz Ferdinand]] and [[The Killers]]. [[Glam metal|Hair metal]] also experienced a brief resurgence during this time with [[Bon Jovi]]'s \"[[It's My Life (Bon Jovi song)|It's My Life]]\", the ''[[Monster Ballads]]'' compilation, and VH1's [[Rock Never Stops Tour]]. The 2002 video game ''[[Grand Theft Auto: Vice City]]'' helped popularize 1980s aesthetics and music among younger generations. The 1980s-oriented television shows ''[[The Goldbergs (2013 TV series)|The Goldbergs]]'', ''[[The Carrie Diaries (TV series)|The Carrie Diaries]]'', ''[[Moonbeam City]]'', ''[[GLOW (TV series)|GLOW]]'', and ''[[Stranger Things]]'' were released in 2010s, as well as the films ''[[Drive (2011 film)|Drive]]'', ''[[Everybody Wants Some]]'', ''[[It (2017 film)|It]]'', ''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]'', ''[[Wonder Woman 1984]]'', ''[[Kung Fury]]'', and ''[[Ready Player One (film)|Ready Player One]]''. A trend for 1980s second-wave synthpop grew at this time along with 1990s-style future house and nu-disco songs by such artists as [[Katy Perry]], [[Justin Timberlake]], and [[Bruno Mars]]; 1980s-influenced songs include \"[[Shut Up and Dance (Walk the Moon song)|Shut Up and Dance]]\" by [[Walk the Moon]], \"[[24K Magic (song)|24K Magic]]\" by Bruno Mars, and \"[[Uptown Funk]]\" by [[Mark Ronson]] featuring Bruno Mars. Numerous 1980s television shows and movies were revived, such as ''[[Footloose (1984 film)|Footloose]]'', ''[[Ghostbusters (1984 film)|Ghostbusters]]'', ''[[Adventures in Babysitting]]'', and ''[[Dirty Dancing (1987 film)|Dirty Dancing]]''. In the 2010s, musical genres/subcultures such as [[vaporwave]], [[synthwave]], [[outrun]], [[retrowave]], and [[lo-fi music]] emerged that mimicked the aesthetics of the 1980s and 1990s; for example, palm trees on a neon galaxy grid background, or [[VHS]] scanlines. The [[Internet]] has aided in the celebration of nostalgia through the creation of these subcultures that mimic the past, oftentimes from people who were born after these decades had ended.\n\nThe 2010s and 2020s have seen a revival of the 1990s\u2013early 2000s. In 2011, TV channel [[Nickelodeon]] established the [[NickSplat]] (formerly The '90s Are All That) block on its [[TeenNick]] station featuring reruns of 1990s Nickelodeon programs, accompanied by much fanfare on [[social media]]. In the early-mid 2010s, \"Only '90s kids will remember\" [[meme]]s were popular online, as well as [[Buzzfeed]] \"'90s kid\" quizzes. There have been revivals of '90s\u2013early 2000s television series such as ''[[Hey Arnold!]]'', ''[[Carmen Sandiego]]'', ''[[The X-Files]]'', ''[[Fuller House (TV series)|Fuller House]]'', ''[[Girl Meets World]]'', ''[[Rocko's Modern Life]]'', ''[[Animaniacs]]'', ''[[The Proud Family]]'', ''[[Arrested Development (TV series)|Arrested Development]]'', ''[[Teen Titans Go!]]'', ''[[The Powerpuff Girls (2016 TV series)|The Powerpuff Girls]]'', ''[[Kim Possible]]'', ''[[Invader Zim]]'', ''[[Lizzie McGuire]]'', ''[[Raven's Home]]'', ''[[Prison Break]]'', and ''[[Samurai Jack]]''. There have also been sequels/reboots to '90s\u2013early 2000s films such as ''[[Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle]]'', ''[[Space Jam 2]]'', ''[[Jurassic World]]'', ''[[Beauty and the Beast (2017 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'', ''[[Aladdin (2019 film)|Aladdin]]'', ''[[The Lion King (2019 film)|The Lion King]]'', ''[[Mulan (2020 film)|Mulan]]'', ''[[Finding Dory]]'', and ''[[The Incredibles 2]]'', as well as adaptations of '90s\u2013early 2000s franchises such as ''[[Goosebumps (film)|Goosebumps]]'', ''[[Artemis Fowl (film)|Artemis Fowl]]'', ''[[Power Rangers (film)|Power Rangers]]'', ''[[A Series of Unfortunate Events (TV series)|A Series of Unfortunate Events]]'', and ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (film)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]''. Television series and movies set in the 1990s or early 2000s such as ''[[Captain Marvel (2019 film)|Captain Marvel]]'', ''[[Everything Sucks!]]'', ''[[Fresh Off the Boat]]'', ''[[Hindsight (TV series)|Hindsight]]'', ''[[Mid90s]]'', ''[[Lady Bird (film)|Lady Bird]]'', and ''[[Pen15]]'' have been released. [[New jack swing]] briefly came back in style in 2018 with \"[[Finesse (song)|Finesse]]\" by Bruno Mars featuring [[Cardi B]], with a [[music video]] inspired by ''[[In Living Color]]''. The 2018 song \"[[1999 (Charli XCX and Troye Sivan song)|1999]]\" by [[Charli XCX]] and [[Troye Sivan]] paid tribute to the pop culture of the late 1990s and the \"Y2K aesthetic\". There was also an ''[[I Love the '90s (U.S. TV series)|I Love the '90s]]'' series that was released in the mid-2000s. The ''[[Pok\u00e9mon]]'' franchise, which was at its peak popularity in the late 1990s, experienced a second-wave Pokemania during summer 2016 with ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Go]]''; the theme song to the original ''[[Pok\u00e9mon (anime)|Pok\u00e9mon]]'' anime briefly became one of the most downloaded songs on [[iTunes]] and [[Spotify]] at this time. The [[Tamagotchi]], originally popular in the '90s\u2013early 2000s, became a hot seller during [[Christmas]] seasons in the 2010s. Discontinued 1990s\u2013early 2000s snacks and drinks such as [[Surge (soda)|Surge]], [[Crystal Pepsi]], [[Dunk-a-roos]], [[Doritos|3D Doritos]], and [[Sprite Remix]] have been re-released.\n\n==== Retrogaming ====\n{{Main|Retrogaming}}\nRetrogaming is a pastime which is becoming increasingly popular where individuals play [[video game]]s on vintage computers or vintage game [[video game console|consoles]]. What constitutes a vintage or retro machine is sometimes open to debate, but typically, most retro gamers are interested in [[Commodore 64]], [[Amiga 500]], [[Atari 2600]], [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]], [[Sega Genesis|Sega Genesis/Mega Drive]], [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]], [[Nintendo 64]], [[Dreamcast]], [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|SNES]], and classic [[Game Boy]] games and consoles.  [[Console emulation|Emulation]] often plays a part in retrogaming if the original hardware is unavailable.\n\n==== Retro erotica (photography) ====\nRetro [[erotica]] is usually [[photography]] in the style of [[Pin-up girl|pinups]] or [[pornography]] typically dating from the 1970s or earlier. It ranges from hardcore to non-nude pinup style photography, often featuring [[lingerie]] such as [[girdle]]s, bullet [[Brassiere|bras]] and [[garter belts]] and [[hosiery]] with hairstyles, makeup, and props fashioned after those periods. Some aficionados distinguish retro (modern photography in an older style) from vintage (actual period photos or film) while others conflate the two as either retro or vintage. There are a number of websites dedicated to both types.\n\n=== Aircraft ===\n[[Image:Qantas Boeing 737-800 (VH-XZP) retrojet.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Qantas]] [[Boeing 737-800]] (VH-XZP) retrojet seen at [[Sydney Airport]] ]]\nA handful of [[airline]]s have chosen to paint a historical [[aircraft livery|livery]] on a single selected [[aircraft]] in their modern fleet, typically as a marketing device or to commemorate an anniversary.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Flynn|first1=David|title=Qantas reveals 'flying kangaroo' livery on Boeing 737|url=http://www.ausbt.com.au/qantas-to-unveil-retro-livery-on-boeing-737|accessdate=31 May 2015|date=17 November 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Mutzabaugh|first1=Ben|title=Happy 85th: LOT adds 'RetroJET' livery to Embraer E175|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/todayinthesky/2014/04/18/happy-85th-lot-adds-retrojet-livery-to-embraer-e175/7865801/|accessdate=31 May 2015|work=USA Today|date=18 April 2014}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Flat design]]\n* [[Kitsch]]\n* [[Irony]]\n* [[Minimalism]]\n* [[Nostalgia]]\n* [[Old school (disambiguation)|Old school]]\n* [[Ostalgie]]\n* [[Period piece]]\n* [[Retrofuturism]]\n* [[Retrotronics]]\n* [[Retro-style automobile]]\n* [[Rockabilly]]\n* [[Self-parody]]\n* [[Steampunk]]\n* [[Throwback uniform]]\n* [[Tiki culture]]\n* [[Vintage clothing]]\n* [[Vintage (design)]]\n* [[List of retro style video game consoles]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n== References ==\n* {{cite book |last= Baudrillard |first= Jean |authorlink= Jean Baudrillard |year= 1995 |title= Simulacra and Simulation |location= Ann Arbor |publisher= University of Michigan Press |isbn= 978-0-472-06521-9 |url= https://archive.org/details/simulacrasimula000baud }}\n* {{cite book |last= Collins |first= James C |authorlink= James C.

The areas of Denmark and Norway remained under the same monarch until 1814, [[Denmark\u2013Norway]]. Beginning in the 17th century, there were several devastating wars with the [[Swedish Empire]], ending with large [[cession]]s of territory to Sweden. After the [[Napoleonic Wars]], Norway was ceded to Sweden, while Denmark kept the Faroe Islands, Greenland, and [[Iceland]]. In the 19th century there was a surge of [[19th century in Denmark|nationalist movements]], which were defeated in the [[First Schleswig War]]. After the [[Second Schleswig War]] in 1864, Denmark lost the [[Duchy of Schleswig]] to Prussia. Denmark remained neutral during [[World War I]], however, in 1920 the northern half of Schleswig became Danish again. In April 1940, a [[German invasion of Denmark (1940)|German invasion]] saw brief [[military]] skirmishes while the [[Danish resistance movement]] was active from 1943 until the [[Occupation of Denmark#Hardship and the end of the war|German surrender]] in May 1945.

It establishes a [[constitutional monarchy]] organised as a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]] democracy. The [[Politics of Denmark|government]] and [[Folketing|national parliament]] are seated in [[Copenhagen]], the nation's [[capital city|capital]], [[list of cities in Denmark by population|largest city]], and main commercial centre.

[[Home rule]] was established in the Faroe Islands\nin 1948; in [[Greenland]] home rule was established in 1979 and [[2008 Greenlandic self-government referendum|further autonomy]] in 2009. Denmark became a member of the [[European Economic Community]] (now the [[European Union|EU]]) in 1973, but negotiated [[Opt-outs in the European Union|certain opt-outs]]; it retains its own currency, the [[Danish krone|krone]].

In the [[Napoleonic Wars]], Denmark traded with both [[First French Empire|France]] and the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] and joined the [[Second League of Armed Neutrality|League of Armed Neutrality]] with [[Russian Empire|Russia]], Sweden, and [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]].<ref>{{cite web|title=League of Armed Neutrality|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100056830|publisher=Oxford Reference|accessdate=28 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924130430/http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100056830|archive-date=24 September 2015|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The British considered this a hostile act and attacked Copenhagen in [[Battle of Copenhagen (1801)|1801]] and [[Battle of Copenhagen (1807)|1807]], in one case carrying off the [[Royal Danish Navy|Danish fleet]], in the other, burning large parts of the Danish capital. This led to the so-called Danish-British [[Gunboat War]]. British control of the waterways between Denmark and Norway proved disastrous to the union's economy and in 1813 Denmark\u2013Norway went [[bankruptcy|bankrupt]].\n\nThe union was dissolved by the [[Treaty of Kiel]] in 1814; the Danish monarchy \"irrevocably and forever\" renounced claims to the Kingdom of Norway in favour of the Swedish king.<ref>{{cite book|last=Jenssen-Tusch|first=Georg Friedrich|title=Zur Regierungsgeschichte Friedrich VI.

A new constitution established a [[Rigsdagen|two-chamber parliament]]. Denmark faced war against both [[Prussia]] and [[Austrian Empire]] in what became known as the [[Second Schleswig War]], lasting from February to October 1864. Denmark was defeated and obliged to [[cession|cede]] [[Province of Schleswig-Holstein|Schleswig and Holstein]] to [[Prussia]].

There was a considerable migration of people from the countryside to the cities, and Danish agriculture became centred on the export of dairy and meat products.\n\nDenmark maintained its neutral stance during [[World War I]]. After the defeat of Germany, the [[Treaty of Versailles|Versailles powers]] offered to return the region of Schleswig-Holstein to Denmark. Fearing German [[irredentism]], Denmark refused to consider the return of the area without a [[plebiscite]]; the two [[Schleswig Plebiscites]] took place on 10 February and 14 March 1920, respectively.

[[Saxo Grammaticus]], normally considered the first Danish writer, worked for bishop [[Absalon]] on a chronicle of [[History of Denmark|Danish history]] (''[[Gesta Danorum]]''). Very little is known of other Danish literature from the [[Middle Ages]]. With the [[Age of Enlightenment]] came [[Ludvig Holberg]] whose comedy plays are still being performed.\n\nIn the late 19th century, literature was seen as a way to influence society. Known as the [[Modern Breakthrough]], this movement was championed by [[Georg Brandes]], [[Henrik Pontoppidan]] (awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]) and [[Jens Peter Jacobsen|J.&nbsp;P. Jacobsen]]. [[Romanticism]] influenced the renowned writer and poet [[Hans Christian Andersen]], known for his stories and [[fairy tale]]s, e.g. ''[[The Ugly Duckling]]'', ''[[The Little Mermaid]]'' and ''[[The Snow Queen]]''. In recent history [[Johannes Vilhelm Jensen]] was also awarded the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]]. [[Karen Blixen]] is famous for her novels and short stories. Other Danish writers of importance are [[Herman Bang]], [[Gustav Wied]], [[William Heinesen]], [[Martin Andersen Nex\u00f8]], [[Piet Hein (Denmark)|Piet Hein]], [[Hans Scherfig]], [[Klaus Rifbjerg]], [[Dan Tur\u00e8ll]], [[Tove Ditlevsen]], [[Inger Christensen]] and [[Peter H\u00f8eg]].\n\nDanish philosophy has a long tradition as part of [[Western philosophy]]. Perhaps the most influential Danish philosopher was [[S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard]], the creator of [[Christian existentialism]]. Kierkegaard had a few Danish followers, including [[Harald H\u00f8ffding]], who later in his life moved on to join the movement of [[positivism]]. Among Kierkegaard's other followers include [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] who was impressed with Kierkegaard's views on the individual, and [[Rollo May]], who helped create [[humanistic psychology]]. Another Danish philosopher of note is [[N. F. S. Grundtvig|Grundtvig]], whose philosophy gave rise to a new form of non-aggressive nationalism in Denmark, and who is also influential for his theological and historical works.\n\n=== Painting and photography ===\n{{Main|Danish art|Photography in Denmark}}\n[[File:C W Eckersberg 1841 - Kvinde foran et spejl.jpg|thumb|right|upright|''Woman in Front of a Mirror'', (1841), by [[Christoffer Wilhelm Eckersberg]]]]\n\nWhile Danish art was influenced over the centuries by trends in Germany and the Netherlands, the 15th and 16th century [[church frescos in Denmark|church frescos]], which can be seen in many of the country's older churches, are of particular interest as they were painted in a style typical of native Danish painters.<ref>[http://www.panoramas.dk/kalkmalerier/ Wall Paintings in Danish Churches from Panoramas.dk] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091128170607/http://www.panoramas.dk/kalkmalerier/ |date=28 November 2009 }}.

These include [[impressionism]] and the modernist styles of [[expressionism]], [[abstract painting]] and [[surrealism]]. While international co-operation and activity has almost always been essential to the Danish artistic community, influential art collectives with a firm Danish base includes [[De Tretten]] (1909\u20131912), [[Linien]] (1930s and 1940s), [[COBRA (avant-garde movement)|COBRA]] (1948\u20131951), [[Fluxus]] (1960s and 1970s), [[Junge Wilde|De Unge Vilde]] (1980s) and more recently [[Superflex]] (founded in 1993). Most Danish painters of modern times have also been very active with other forms of artistic expressions, such as sculpting, ceramics, art installations, activism, film and experimental architecture. Notable Danish painters from modern times representing various [[art movements]] include [[Theodor Philipsen]] (1840\u20131920, impressionism and naturalism), [[Anna Klindt S\u00f8rensen]] (1899\u20131985, expressionism), [[Franciska Clausen]] (1899\u20131986, Neue Sachlichkeit, cubism, surrealism and others), [[Henry Heerup]] (1907\u20131993, naivism), [[Robert Jacobsen]] (1912\u20131993, abstract painting), [[Carl Henning Pedersen]] (1913\u20132007, abstract painting), [[Asger Jorn]] (1914\u20131973, Situationist, abstract painting), [[Bj\u00f8rn Wiinblad]] (1918\u20132006, art deco, orientalism), [[Per Kirkeby]] (b. 1938, neo-expressionism, abstract painting), [[Per Arnoldi]] (b. 1941, pop art), [[Michael Kvium]] (b. 1955, neo-surrealism) and Simone Aaberg K\u00e6rn (b. 1969, superrealism).\n\nDanish photography has developed from strong participation and interest in the very beginnings of the [[history of photography|art of photography]] in 1839 to the success of a considerable number of Danes in the world of photography today. Pioneers such as [[Mads Alstrup]] and [[Georg Emil Hansen]] paved the way for a rapidly growing profession during the last half of the 19th century. Today Danish photographers such as [[Astrid Kruse Jensen]] and [[Jacob Aue Sobol]] are active both at home and abroad, participating in key exhibitions around the world.<ref>[http://www.photography-now.com/popup_ausst_5.php?id_ausstellungen=T50624 Contemporary Danish Photography.

Danish dishes are highly seasonal, stemming from the country's agricultural past, its geography, and its climate of long, cold winters.\n\nThe open sandwiches on rye bread, known as ''[[sm\u00f8rrebr\u00f8d]]'', which in their basic form are the usual fare for lunch, can be considered a national speciality when prepared and decorated with a variety of fine ingredients. Hot meals traditionally consist of [[ground meat]]s, such as ''[[frikadeller]]'' (meat balls of veal and pork) and ''hakkeb\u00f8f'' (minced beef patties), or of more substantial meat and fish dishes such as ''[[fl\u00e6skesteg]]'' (roast pork with crackling) and ''kogt torsk'' (poached cod) with mustard sauce and trimmings. Denmark is known for its [[Carlsberg Group|Carlsberg]] and [[Tuborg]] beers and for its [[akvavit]] and [[bitters]].\n\nSince around 1970, chefs and restaurants across Denmark have introduced [[gourmet]] cooking, largely influenced by [[French cuisine]]. Also inspired by continental practices, Danish chefs have recently developed a new innovative cuisine and a series of gourmet dishes based on high-quality local produce known as [[New Danish cuisine]].<ref>{{cite web|title=new nordic recipes|url=http://denmark.dk/en/lifestyle/food-drink/new-nordic-recipes|publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark|accessdate=15 August 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160807191139/http://denmark.dk/en/lifestyle/food-drink/new-nordic-recipes/|archive-date=7 August 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> As a result of these developments, Denmark now have a considerable number of internationally acclaimed restaurants of which several have been awarded [[Michelin Guide|Michelin stars]].

The areas of Denmark and Norway remained under the same monarch until 1814, [[Denmark\u2013Norway]]. Beginning in the 17th century, there were several devastating wars with the [[Swedish Empire]], ending with large [[cession]]s of territory to Sweden. After the [[Napoleonic Wars]], Norway was ceded to Sweden, while Denmark kept the Faroe Islands, Greenland, and [[Iceland]]. In the 19th century there was a surge of [[19th century in Denmark|nationalist movements]], which were defeated in the [[First Schleswig War]]. After the [[Second Schleswig War]] in 1864, Denmark lost the [[Duchy of Schleswig]] to Prussia. Denmark remained neutral during [[World War I]], however, in 1920 the northern half of Schleswig became Danish again. In April 1940, a [[German invasion of Denmark (1940)|German invasion]] saw brief [[military]] skirmishes while the [[Danish resistance movement]] was active from 1943 until the [[Occupation of Denmark#Hardship and the end of the war|German surrender]] in May 1945.

It establishes a [[constitutional monarchy]] organised as a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]] democracy. The [[Politics of Denmark|government]] and [[Folketing|national parliament]] are seated in [[Copenhagen]], the nation's [[capital city|capital]], [[list of cities in Denmark by population|largest city]], and main commercial centre. Denmark exercises [[Hegemony|hegemonic]] influence in the [[Danish Realm]], [[devolution|devolving]] powers to handle internal affairs. [[Home rule]] was established in the Faroe Islands\nin 1948; in [[Greenland]] home rule was established in 1979 and [[2008 Greenlandic self-government referendum|further autonomy]] in 2009. Denmark became a member of the [[European Economic Community]] (now the [[European Union|EU]]) in 1973, but negotiated [[Opt-outs in the European Union|certain opt-outs]]; it retains its own currency, the [[Danish krone|krone]]. It is among the founding members of [[NATO]], the [[Nordic Council]], the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]], [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|OSCE]], and the [[United Nations]]; it is also part of the [[Schengen Area]].

It is believed that Denmark became Christian for political reasons so as not to get invaded by the rising [[Holy Roman Empire|Christian power]] in Europe, the [[Holy Roman Empire]], which was an important trading area for the Danes. In that case, Harald built six [[fortresses]] around Denmark called [[Viking ring fortress|Trelleborg]] and built a further [[Danevirke]].

Most of the latter two now form the state of [[Schleswig-Holstein]] in northern Germany.\n\nIn 1397, Denmark entered into a [[personal union]] with [[Norway]] and [[Sweden\u2013Finland|Sweden]], united under Queen [[Margaret I of Denmark|Margaret I]].{{sfn|Stone|Bain|Booth|Parnell|2008|p=33}} The three countries were to be treated as equals in the union.

The issue was for practical purposes resolved on 17 June 1523, as [[List of Swedish monarchs|Swedish King]] [[Gustav I of Sweden|Gustav Vasa]] conquered the city of [[Stockholm]]. The [[Protestant Reformation]] spread to Scandinavia in the 1530s, and following the [[Count's Feud]] civil war, [[Reformation in Denmark\u2013Norway and Holstein|Denmark converted]] to [[Lutheranism]] in 1536.

[[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassicism]] from France was slowly adopted by native Danish architects who increasingly participated in defining architectural style. A productive period of [[Historicism (art)|Historicism]] ultimately merged into the 19th-century [[National Romantic style]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visitdenmark.com/irland/en-ie/menu/turist/inspiration/detkulturelledanmark/arkitektur/danish-architecture-an-overview.htm |title=Danish Architecture: An Overview |accessdate=19 July 2011 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719130528/http://www.visitdenmark.com/irland/en-ie/menu/turist/inspiration/detkulturelledanmark/arkitektur/danish-architecture-an-overview.htm |archivedate=19 July 2011 |df=dmy }}, ''Visit Denmark''.

Danish design is typically applied to industrial design, furniture and household objects, which have won many international awards. The [[Royal Copenhagen|Royal Porcelain Factory]] is famous for the quality of its ceramics and export products worldwide. Danish design is also a well-known brand, often associated with world-famous, 20th-century designers and architects such as [[B\u00f8rge Mogensen]], [[Finn Juhl]], [[Hans Wegner]], [[Arne Jacobsen]], [[Poul Henningsen]] and [[Verner Panton]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20100522002856/http://en.ddc.dk/denmarkbydesign \"Danish by Design\"], ''DDC''.

[[Saxo Grammaticus]], normally considered the first Danish writer, worked for bishop [[Absalon]] on a chronicle of [[History of Denmark|Danish history]] (''[[Gesta Danorum]]''). Very little is known of other Danish literature from the [[Middle Ages]]. With the [[Age of Enlightenment]] came [[Ludvig Holberg]] whose comedy plays are still being performed.\n\nIn the late 19th century, literature was seen as a way to influence society. Known as the [[Modern Breakthrough]], this movement was championed by [[Georg Brandes]], [[Henrik Pontoppidan]] (awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]) and [[Jens Peter Jacobsen|J.&nbsp;P. Jacobsen]]. [[Romanticism]] influenced the renowned writer and poet [[Hans Christian Andersen]], known for his stories and [[fairy tale]]s, e.g. ''[[The Ugly Duckling]]'', ''[[The Little Mermaid]]'' and ''[[The Snow Queen]]''. In recent history [[Johannes Vilhelm Jensen]] was also awarded the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]]. [[Karen Blixen]] is famous for her novels and short stories. Other Danish writers of importance are [[Herman Bang]], [[Gustav Wied]], [[William Heinesen]], [[Martin Andersen Nex\u00f8]], [[Piet Hein (Denmark)|Piet Hein]], [[Hans Scherfig]], [[Klaus Rifbjerg]], [[Dan Tur\u00e8ll]], [[Tove Ditlevsen]], [[Inger Christensen]] and [[Peter H\u00f8eg]].\n\nDanish philosophy has a long tradition as part of [[Western philosophy]]. Perhaps the most influential Danish philosopher was [[S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard]], the creator of [[Christian existentialism]]. Kierkegaard had a few Danish followers, including [[Harald H\u00f8ffding]], who later in his life moved on to join the movement of [[positivism]]. Among Kierkegaard's other followers include [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] who was impressed with Kierkegaard's views on the individual, and [[Rollo May]], who helped create [[humanistic psychology]]. Another Danish philosopher of note is [[N. F. S. Grundtvig|Grundtvig]], whose philosophy gave rise to a new form of non-aggressive nationalism in Denmark, and who is also influential for his theological and historical works.\n\n=== Painting and photography ===\n{{Main|Danish art|Photography in Denmark}}\n[[File:C W Eckersberg 1841 - Kvinde foran et spejl.jpg|thumb|right|upright|''Woman in Front of a Mirror'', (1841), by [[Christoffer Wilhelm Eckersberg]]]]\n\nWhile Danish art was influenced over the centuries by trends in Germany and the Netherlands, the 15th and 16th century [[church frescos in Denmark|church frescos]], which can be seen in many of the country's older churches, are of particular interest as they were painted in a style typical of native Danish painters.<ref>[http://www.panoramas.dk/kalkmalerier/ Wall Paintings in Danish Churches from Panoramas.dk] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091128170607/http://www.panoramas.dk/kalkmalerier/ |date=28 November 2009 }}.

These include [[impressionism]] and the modernist styles of [[expressionism]], [[abstract painting]] and [[surrealism]]. While international co-operation and activity has almost always been essential to the Danish artistic community, influential art collectives with a firm Danish base includes [[De Tretten]] (1909\u20131912), [[Linien]] (1930s and 1940s), [[COBRA (avant-garde movement)|COBRA]] (1948\u20131951), [[Fluxus]] (1960s and 1970s), [[Junge Wilde|De Unge Vilde]] (1980s) and more recently [[Superflex]] (founded in 1993). Most Danish painters of modern times have also been very active with other forms of artistic expressions, such as sculpting, ceramics, art installations, activism, film and experimental architecture. Notable Danish painters from modern times representing various [[art movements]] include [[Theodor Philipsen]] (1840\u20131920, impressionism and naturalism), [[Anna Klindt S\u00f8rensen]] (1899\u20131985, expressionism), [[Franciska Clausen]] (1899\u20131986, Neue Sachlichkeit, cubism, surrealism and others), [[Henry Heerup]] (1907\u20131993, naivism), [[Robert Jacobsen]] (1912\u20131993, abstract painting), [[Carl Henning Pedersen]] (1913\u20132007, abstract painting), [[Asger Jorn]] (1914\u20131973, Situationist, abstract painting), [[Bj\u00f8rn Wiinblad]] (1918\u20132006, art deco, orientalism), [[Per Kirkeby]] (b. 1938, neo-expressionism, abstract painting), [[Per Arnoldi]] (b. 1941, pop art), [[Michael Kvium]] (b. 1955, neo-surrealism) and Simone Aaberg K\u00e6rn (b. 1969, superrealism).\n\nDanish photography has developed from strong participation and interest in the very beginnings of the [[history of photography|art of photography]] in 1839 to the success of a considerable number of Danes in the world of photography today. Pioneers such as [[Mads Alstrup]] and [[Georg Emil Hansen]] paved the way for a rapidly growing profession during the last half of the 19th century.

The College also offers DVSc, PhD, MSc, MPH, and Diploma programs at the graduate level. The DVM program is one of the most competitive in the world.  The annual number of places available in the [[Doctor of Veterinary Medicine]] (DVM) program is ''120 seats with 105 for Canadians with Ontario residency and 15 for non-Canadians''.\n\n==Student life==\nEach year 120 student veterinarians are admitted to the school, after successfully completing the highly competitive application and interview processes. Student veterinarians at OVC can usually be found studying in the Lifetime Learning Center, having a coffee in the Pathobiology building, or playing hocking at the Gryphon Center. A tradition at OVC is the naming of each class with a mascot and a colour. This mascot represents the class throughout the four phases, and is used regularly in conjunction with not only academics, but also intramural sports. Hockey plays a large part in these intramurals, with rivalries coming to a head in a college wide \"Challenge Cup\" tournament, held each year in March. \n\nPast Classes have included:\n*The 2000 Green Dragons,\n*The 2001 Purple Otters,\n*The 2002 Silver Polar Bears,\n*The 2003 Cougars,\n*The 2004 Falcons,\n*The 2005 Red Foxes,\n*The 2006 Broncos\n*The 2007 Golden Grizzlies\n*The 2008 Blue [[Canadian Eskimo Dog|Qimmiqs]]\n*The 2009 Jade Jaguars\n*The 2010 Crimson Crocodiles <ref>http://www.uoguelph.ca/~crocs10/CrimsonCrocs.html</ref>\n*The 2011 Black Mambas\n*The 2012 Silver Foxes\n*The 2013 Golden Phoenixes\n*The 2014 Emerald Elephants\n*The 2015 Scarlet Stags\n*The 2016 Cobalt Caracals\n*The 2017 Violet Komodos\n*The 2018 Ivory Owls\n*The 2019 Golden Krakens\n\nCurrent Classes are:\n*The 2020 Ruby Rhinos\n*The 2021 Sapphire Snow Leopards\n*The 2022 Jade Jackals\n*The 2023 Opal Otters\n\n==Notable professors==\nDr. W.

The intent was to help the college develop a primary-care teaching hospital for small animals. <ref>{{cite web |url=https://news.ontario.ca/archive/en/2008/02/12/Ontario-invests-in-new-hospital-at-Ontario-Veterinary-College.html |title=Ontario invests in new hospital at Ontario Veterinary College |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=February 12, 2008  |website=News Ontario |publisher=Province of Ontario |access-date=January 25, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe Hill's Primary Healthcare Centre opened during the summer of 2010  as a veterinary clinic and an educational facility for all veterinary students.  A new state-of-the-art Pathobiology building opened in the fall of 2010.  A new large animal isolation facility serves to treat equine patients at high-risk for infectious disease.\n\nIn March 2016, the provincial government announced a $23 million grant to add a new building and to renovate the animal hospital. The plan was to  add new classrooms and labs, to install new equipment and to improve biosecurity and infection control.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/kitchener-waterloo/guelph-vet-college-province-funding-23-million-1.3497878 |title=Ontario Vet College gets $23M for learning space, equipment |author=staff writer |date=March 18, 2016 |website=CBC News |publisher=CBC |access-date=January 25, 2017 |quote=College at University of Guelph transforms to meet the needs of students}}</ref>\n\n==Campus==\nThe main OVC building is located on Gordon St. at College St. in Guelph, Ontario.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ovc.uoguelph.ca/visiting-college |title=OVC Visiting the College |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=2016 |website=University of Guelph, OVC |publisher=University of Guelph |access-date=January 25, 2017}}</ref> The Dean's Office is at 50 Stone Road, Guelph.\n\n==Academics==\nOVC offers bachelor's degrees in bio-medical science, but its primary degree offering is the DVM ([[Doctor of Veterinary Medicine]]).  The College also offers DVSc, PhD, MSc, MPH, and Diploma programs at the graduate level. The DVM program is one of the most competitive in the world.  The annual number of places available in the [[Doctor of Veterinary Medicine]] (DVM) program is ''120 seats with 105 for Canadians with Ontario residency and 15 for non-Canadians''.\n\n==Student life==\nA tradition at OVC is the naming of each class with a mascot and a colour. This mascot represents the class throughout the four phases, and is used regularly in conjunction with not only academics, but also intramural sports. Hockey plays a large part in these intramurals, with rivalries coming to a head in a college wide \"Challenge Cup\" tournament, held each year in March.\n\nPast Classes have included:\n*The 2000 Green Dragons,\n*The 2001 Purple Otters,\n*The 2002 Silver Polar Bears,\n*The 2003 Cougars,\n*The 2004 Falcons,\n*The 2005 Red Foxes,\n*The 2006 Broncos\n*The 2007 Golden Grizzlies\n*The 2008 Blue [[Canadian Eskimo Dog|Qimmiqs]]\n*The 2009 Jade Jaguars\n*The 2010 Crimson Crocodiles <ref>http://www.uoguelph.ca/~crocs10/CrimsonCrocs.html</ref>\n*The 2011 Black Mambas\n*The 2012 Silver Foxes\n*The 2013 Golden Phoenixes\n*The 2014 Emerald Elephants\n*The 2015 Scarlet Stags\n*The 2016 Cobalt Caracals\n*The 2017 Violet Komodos\n*The 2018 Ivory Owls\n*The 2019 Golden Krakens\n\nCurrent Classes are:\n*The 2020 Ruby Rhinos\n*The 2021 Sapphire Snow Leopards\n*The 2022 Jade Jackals\n*The 2023 Opal Otters\n\n==Notable professors==\nDr. W.

These included steel, copper, petrochemicals, paper, coal, and oil.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Nehru Mahalanobis Model|last=Bhatia|first=V.G.|date=1990|work=Economic and Political Weekly|jstor = 4396620}}</ref> [[Prasanta Chandra Mahalanobis|Mahalanobis]] strived for India to reach autonomy, ridding any outstanding debts.

This can be broken down further, however, because certain demographics of women in India have seen job rates decline while some have seen them rise.

It is argued that the pattern of Indian development has been a specific one and that the country may be able to skip the intermediate [[industrialisation]]-led phase in the transformation of its economic structure.

Post-Independence, [[Jawaharlal Nehru|Jawaharal Nehru]] enacted an economic policy based on [[import substitution industrialization]]. The Nehru-Mahalanobis approach, often referred to as the [[Five-Year Plans of India|Second Five Year Plan]], emphasized the development of basic and heavy industries as a means of accelerating economic growth. These included steel, copper, petrochemicals, paper, coal, and oil.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Nehru Mahalanobis Model|last=Bhatia|first=V.G.|date=1990|work=Economic and Political Weekly|jstor = 4396620}}</ref> [[Prasanta Chandra Mahalanobis|Mahalanobis]] strived for India to reach autonomy, ridding any outstanding debts. Critics disagreed with this approach, stating that [[World Bank|World Bank's]] claim of Indian export prospects being low were falsified and due to India's inward-looking strategy, the growth opportunity of the world economy was missed.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=2015|title=Editorial Note|journal=Social Scientist|volume=43|issue=3/4|pages=1\u20132|issn=0970-0293|jstor=24372931}}</ref> Nonetheless, over 1950-1965, India's acceleration of per capita income growth had increased an average of 1.7%, a value not exceeded since.\n\nThe discourse on the efficacy of the Nehru-Mahalanobis Strategy is commonly contested by economists. A criticism of the approach emphasizes the lack of resource allocation in the agriculture sector. It is argued that the misbalanced weightage towards the machine-making sector contributed to the increase in food-grain prices and thus, perpetuated poverty and malnutrition.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Patnaik|first=Prabhat|date=March 2015|title=The Nehru\u2013Mahalanobis Strategy|journal=Social Scientist|volume=43|issue=3/4|pages=3\u201310|jstor=24372932}}</ref> Defenders of the strategy claim that it sought to increase agricultural output by increasing the [[Incremental capital-output ratio|output-capital ratio]].

It offers various banking services and products related to deposit, investment, trust, cash management, remittance, and financing products and services.

Chuan]], [[Albino SyCip]], Guillermo A. CuUnjieng, [[Carlos Palanca|Carlos Palanca Sr.]] and other visionaries, opened its first office at No. 90 Rosario (now Quintin Paredes) Street, [[Binondo]] on August 16, 1920, with J.W. McFerran as the first general manager. Shortly afterward, Eugene E. Wing of the International Banking Corporation took over and managed China Bank's operations until 1936. This mixture of cultures represented a seamless merger of Western and Eastern banking policies\u2014an obvious lack during those days when financial institutions governed by Western policies declined credit loans of wealthy Filipino-Chinese businesspeople who operated on the principle of ''x\u00ecny\u00f2ng'' (\u4fe1\u7528) or trustworthiness. China Bank recognized the value of ''x\u00ecny\u00f2ng'' and granted small loans and opened credit accounts with patrons and suppliers without demand for collateral.\n\nChina Bank later opened two overseas branches in China, one in [[Amoy]] in 1925 and another in [[Shanghai]] in 1929. However, both branches closed in 1944 when political conditions in China became inimical to operations.\n\nWhen the [[Japanese occupation of the Philippines|Japanese occupational forces]] invaded Manila in 1942, China Bank closed. However, by the end of 1941, the Bank had been making steady deposits and turning over assets to the [[High Commissioner to the Philippines|United States High Commissioner to the Philippines]] [[Francis Bowes Sayre Sr.]] for safekeeping, with the help of the officials of the US Treasury Department of Manila. With these overseas assets and the Bureau of Banking's full cooperation, China Bank reopened in 1945 and was listed on the [[Philippine Stock Exchange|Manila Stock Exchange]] in 1947 as among the first local banks to be listed.\n\nChina Bank played a key role in post-World War II reconstruction and recovery through its support to businesses and entrepreneurs in critical industries. It opened its first branch outside Manila in [[Cebu]] in 1949. In 1969, China Bank computerized its operations, becoming the first bank in Southeast Asia to process deposit accounts online. China Bank upgraded its online system in 1988 and launched the ''TellerCard'' ATM account and ''TellerPhone'', the first telephone banking service in the Philippines. In 1990, China Bank, along with seven other banks, set up [[BancNet]], currently the country's largest ATM network.\n\nIn 1991, China Bank acquired its universal bank license, ushering an era of expanded banking operations. It launched its consumer loans in 1994, ''China Bank HomePlus Loan'' and ''China Bank AutoPlus Loan'', followed by ''China Check Plus'', an interest-earning checking account in 1996.  In the same year, China Bank accessed offshore capital markets for the first time by issuing US$50M Floating Rate Certificate of Deposit (FRCD).\n\nAs China Bank invested in new technologies, it launched its Cash Management services in 2004, followed by internet banking (''China Bank Online'') and remittance services in 2006.\n\nIn the same year, China Bank, with 146 branches at the time, embarked on an aggressive branch network expansion program.  Over the last six years,{{when|date=January 2018}} the bank has doubled its nationwide branch network.\n\n===Recent developments===\nChina Bank has been involved in strategic alliances to expand and strengthen its operations. In 2007, China Bank entered into a Bancassurance joint venture with The Manufactures Life Insurance Company, one of the leading insurance companies in the world, to form [[Manulife China Bank Life Assurance Corporation]] (MCBLife),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.manulife.com/error/404.html|title=404|website=Corporate}}</ref> and acquired the majority shares in Manila Bank, one of the oldest savings banks in the country.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.philstar.com/business/2007/10/04/18320/china-bank-open-thrift-banking-unit|title=China Bank to open thrift banking unit|first=Ted P.|last=Torres|website=philstar.com}}</ref>\n\nIn 2008, China Bank's thrift bank subsidiary China Bank Savings (CBS) began operations. Positioned to be an alternative to traditional banking, CBS targets entry level and start-up customers to asset accumulators, offering products and services that match different life stages, like basic deposit products for those building up their savings, basic loan products to fund personal dreams, and investment products. In 2012, China Bank acquired Pampanga-based Unity Bank, which was merged with CBS in 2014. The acquisition supports the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas' Strengthening Program for Rural Banks (SPRB) Plus, which aims to effectively serve the countryside and improve the delivery of financial services to rural communities by strengthening the thrift and rural banking industry. The merger fast-tracked the savings bank's branch expansion program. CBS was targeting 100 branches by 2014.\n\nIn September 2013, China Bank forged a deal to acquire a majority stake in [[Planters Development Bank]] (Plantersbank), a development-oriented finance institution nationally acclaimed as the country's lead bank for small and medium enterprises (SMEs).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.phstocks.com/2013/09/china-bank-strengthens-sme-focus-with-plantersbank-deal/|title=China Bank Strengthens SME Focus with Plantersbank Deal|work=PHStocks|accessdate=18 January 2015}}</ref> The merger was approved in May 2014 by the BSP.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessmonitor.com/news-and-views/bsp-approves-china-bank%E2%80%99s-bid-to-acquire-remaining-stake-in-planters-bank|title=BSP Approves China Bank\u2019s Bid To Acquire Remaining Stake In Planters Bank - Philippines - Business Monitor|work=Businessmonitor.com|accessdate=18 January 2015}}</ref> CBS will absorb the 78 branches and the two unopened branch licenses of Plantersbank.\n\nTo complete its range of product offerings, China Bank entered into a credit card partnership with MasterCard in 2013.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://businessmirror.com.ph/index.php/en/business/banking-finance/17149-china-bank-partners-with-mastercard |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-09-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140903022645/http://businessmirror.com.ph/index.php/en/business/banking-finance/17149-china-bank-partners-with-mastercard |archivedate=2014-09-03 }}</ref> China Bank is launching three credit card types under the MasterCard brand in the last quarter of 2014: China Bank Prime, China Bank Platinum, China Bank World MasterCard\u2014all equipped with two of the world's most advanced security technologies: EMV and 3D Secure.\n\nOn September 1, 2014, Ricardo R.

It was the first privately owned local commercial bank in the [[Philippines]] initially catering to the banking needs of [[Chinese Filipino]] businesspeople. It offers various banking services and products related to deposit, investment, trust, cash management, remittance, and financing products and services. It also offers insurance brokerage and bancassurance services through its subsidiary and affiliates.\n\nChina Bank was included in the list of one of the \"top 100 ASEAN companies in terms of delivering shareholder value\" by the American consulting firm Stern Stewart and Company in 2009.<ref>[http://www.sminvestments.com/china-bank-9-other-local-firms-asia-exclusive-list ]{{dead link|date=February 2020}}</ref> It was also awarded the Best Wealth Management House in the Philippines by ''The Asset Magazine'' (HK) in 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.philstar.com/business/banking/2011/10/04/733248/china-banks-private-banking-arm-named-best-wealth-mgmt|title=China Bank's private banking arm named best in wealth mgmt|website=philstar.com}}</ref> At the 2012 Bell Awards of the Philippine Stock Exchange, China Bank was named as one of the best-governed companies in the Philippines.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://business.inquirer.net/96621/ayala-sm-units-dominate-1st-bell-awards|title=Ayala, SM units dominate 1st Bell Awards|first=Doris C.|last=Dumlao|website=business.inquirer.net}}</ref> It was the only bank among the top five awardees in the publicly listed companies category.

Chuan]], [[Albino SyCip]], Guillermo A. CuUnjieng, [[Carlos Palanca|Carlos Palanca Sr.]] and other visionaries, opened its first office at No. 90 Rosario (now Quintin Paredes) Street, [[Binondo]] on August 16, 1920, with J.W. McFerran as the first general manager. Shortly afterward, Eugene E. Wing of the International Banking Corporation took over and managed China Bank's operations until 1936. This mixture of cultures represented a seamless merger of Western and Eastern banking policies\u2014an obvious lack during those days when financial institutions governed by Western policies declined credit loans of wealthy Filipino-Chinese businesspeople who operated on the principle of ''x\u00ecny\u00f2ng'' (\u4fe1\u7528) or trustworthiness. China Bank recognized the value of ''x\u00ecny\u00f2ng'' and granted small loans and opened credit accounts with patrons and suppliers without demand for collateral.\n\nChina Bank later opened two overseas branches in China, one in [[Amoy]] in 1925 and another in [[Shanghai]] in 1929. However, both branches closed in 1944 when political conditions in China became inimical to operations.\n\nWhen the [[Japanese occupation of the Philippines|Japanese occupational forces]] invaded Manila in 1942, China Bank closed. However, by the end of 1941, the Bank had been making steady deposits and turning over assets to the [[High Commissioner to the Philippines|United States High Commissioner to the Philippines]] [[Francis Bowes Sayre Sr.]] for safekeeping, with the help of the officials of the US Treasury Department of Manila. With these overseas assets and the Bureau of Banking\u2019s full cooperation, China Bank reopened in 1945 and was listed on the [[Philippine Stock Exchange|Manila Stock Exchange]] in 1947 as among the first local banks to be listed.\n\nChina Bank played a key role in post-World War II reconstruction and recovery through its support to businesses and entrepreneurs in critical industries. It opened its first branch outside Manila in [[Cebu]] in 1949. In 1969, China Bank computerized its operations, becoming the first bank in Southeast Asia to process deposit accounts online. China Bank upgraded its online system in 1988 and launched the ''TellerCard'' ATM account and ''TellerPhone'', the first telephone banking service in the Philippines. In 1990, China Bank, along with seven other banks, set up [[BancNet]], currently the country's largest ATM network.\n\nIn 1991, China Bank acquired its universal bank license, ushering an era of expanded banking operations. It launched its consumer loans in 1994, ''China Bank HomePlus Loan'' and ''China Bank AutoPlus Loan'', followed by ''China Check Plus'', an interest-earning checking account in 1996.  In the same year, China Bank accessed offshore capital markets for the first time by issuing US$50M Floating Rate Certificate of Deposit (FRCD).\n\nAs China Bank invested in new technologies, it launched its Cash Management services in 2004, followed by internet banking (''China Bank Online'') and remittance services in 2006.\n\nIn the same year, China Bank, with 146 branches at the time, embarked on an aggressive branch network expansion program.  Over the last six years,{{when|date=January 2018}} the bank has doubled its nationwide branch network.\n\n===Recent developments===\nChina Bank has been involved in strategic alliances to expand and strengthen its operations. In 2007, China Bank entered into a Bancassurance joint venture with The Manufactures Life Insurance Company, one of the leading insurance companies in the world, to form [[Manulife China Bank Life Assurance Corporation]] (MCBLife),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.manulife.com/error/404.html|title=404|website=Corporate}}</ref> and acquired the majority shares in Manila Bank, one of the oldest savings banks in the country.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.philstar.com/business/2007/10/04/18320/china-bank-open-thrift-banking-unit|title=China Bank to open thrift banking unit|first=Ted P.|last=Torres|website=philstar.com}}</ref>\n\nIn 2008, China Bank's thrift bank subsidiary China Bank Savings (CBS) began operations. Positioned to be an alternative to traditional banking, CBS targets entry level and start-up customers to asset accumulators, offering products and services that match different life stages, like basic deposit products for those building up their savings, basic loan products to fund personal dreams, and investment products. In 2012, China Bank acquired Pampanga-based Unity Bank, which was merged with CBS in 2014. The acquisition supports the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas' Strengthening Program for Rural Banks (SPRB) Plus, which aims to effectively serve the countryside and improve the delivery of financial services to rural communities by strengthening the thrift and rural banking industry. The merger fast-tracked the savings bank's branch expansion program. CBS was targeting 100 branches by 2014.\n\nIn September 2013, China Bank forged a deal to acquire a majority stake in [[Planters Development Bank]] (Plantersbank), a development-oriented finance institution nationally acclaimed as the country's lead bank for small and medium enterprises (SMEs).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.phstocks.com/2013/09/china-bank-strengthens-sme-focus-with-plantersbank-deal/|title=China Bank Strengthens SME Focus with Plantersbank Deal|work=PHStocks|accessdate=18 January 2015}}</ref> The merger was approved in May 2014 by the BSP.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessmonitor.com/news-and-views/bsp-approves-china-bank%E2%80%99s-bid-to-acquire-remaining-stake-in-planters-bank|title=BSP Approves China Bank\u2019s Bid To Acquire Remaining Stake In Planters Bank - Philippines - Business Monitor|work=Businessmonitor.com|accessdate=18 January 2015}}</ref> CBS will absorb the 78 branches and the two unopened branch licenses of Plantersbank.\n\nTo complete its range of product offerings, China Bank entered into a credit card partnership with MasterCard in 2013.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://businessmirror.com.ph/index.php/en/business/banking-finance/17149-china-bank-partners-with-mastercard |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-09-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140903022645/http://businessmirror.com.ph/index.php/en/business/banking-finance/17149-china-bank-partners-with-mastercard |archivedate=2014-09-03 }}</ref> China Bank is launching three credit card types under the MasterCard brand in the last quarter of 2014: China Bank Prime, China Bank Platinum, China Bank World MasterCard\u2014all equipped with two of the world's most advanced security technologies: EMV and 3D Secure.\n\nOn September 1, 2014, Ricardo R.
