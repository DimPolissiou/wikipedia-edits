Folk arts like [[Yakshagana]] are also popular.\n\nRathabeedhi Geleyaru and Kalavrinda are local non-profit organisations, founded to encourage creative pursuits, especially those that keep alive the traditions of the region.

Lord Krishna is offered food of different varieties every day, and there are certain restrictions on ingredients during Chaturmasa (a four-month period during the monsoon season). These restrictions coupled with the requirement of variety led to innovation, especially in dishes incorporating seasonal and locally available materials.<ref>http://www.newskarnataka.com/udupi/jackfruit-mela-2015-brings-jackfruit-lovers-together</ref> This cuisine was developed by [[Shivalli]] Madhwa Brahmins who cooked food for Lord Krishna, and at Krishna Matha in Udupi, the food is provided free of cost. Restaurants specialised in Udupi cuisine can be seen widely in most metropolitan and large cities around the length and breadth of India.\n\nAlthough popular for its vegetarian cuisine, Udupi has its fair share of non-vegetarian dishes that are similar to Tuluva or Mangalorean cuisine. Some of these include Kori Roti, Kori Pulimunchi, Chicken Sukka, Fish Curry, Fish Fry and more.\n[[File:The gate to Udupi Town.jpg|thumb|Town gate]]\n\n==Economy==\nUdupi is becoming a major town in Karnataka.

However, because of stiff opposition from citizens and environmentalist groups, the project has been temporarily suspended. An attempt by the Nagarjuna Power Corporation to set up a similar plant at nearby [[Padubidri]] also met strong opposition. Now, the power plant has been set up, generating 1,200 MW of power under the name of Udupi Power Corporation Limited (UPCL), a subsidiary of Lanco Infra, an Andhra Pradesh-based infrastructure major. The opposition, however, continues.\n\n[[Manipal]], a suburb of Udupi, is home to the headquarters of Syndicate Bank. It is renowned as an education and medical hub.

The residents celebrate festivals such as [[Makara Sankranti]], [[Naga Panchami|Nagara Panchami]], [[Krishna Janmashtami]], [[Navaratri]], [[Deepavali]], [[Eid al-Adha]], [[Eid al-Fitr]] and [[Christmas]]. Folk arts like [[Yakshagana]] are also popular.\n\nRathabeedhi Geleyaru and Kalavrinda are local non-profit organisations, founded to encourage creative pursuits, especially those that keep alive the traditions of the region. Its primary focus has been historical dramas.\n\nDuring Krishna Janmashtami, [[Pili Yesa]], a traditional folk dance originated in Udupi is demonstrated on the streets. \"Pili Yesa\" translates to Tiger costume in Tulu (a local language).\n\n==Cuisine==\n{{Main|Udupi cuisine}}\n[[File:Masala Dosa (27429188304).jpg|thumb|right|[[Masala dosa]] is a part of Udupi cuisine.]]\nThe term ''Udupi'' (also ''Udipi'') is synonymous with vegetarian food now found all over the world.{{citation needed|reason=Proof to such a claim|date=October 2014}} The origin of this cuisine is linked to Krishna Matha (Mutt). Lord Krishna is offered food of different varieties every day, and there are certain restrictions on ingredients during Chaturmasa (a four-month period during the monsoon season). These restrictions coupled with the requirement of variety led to innovation, especially in dishes incorporating seasonal and locally available materials.<ref>http://www.newskarnataka.com/udupi/jackfruit-mela-2015-brings-jackfruit-lovers-together</ref> This cuisine was developed by [[Shivalli]] Madhwa Brahmins who cooked food for Lord Krishna, and at Krishna Matha in Udupi, the food is provided free of cost. Restaurants specialised in Udupi cuisine can be seen widely in most metropolitan and large cities around the length and breadth of India.\n\nAlthough popular for its vegetarian cuisine, Udupi has its fair share of non-vegetarian dishes that are similar to Tuluva or Mangalorean cuisine. Some of these include Kori Roti, Kori Pulimunchi, Chicken Sukka, Fish Curry, Fish Fry and more.\n[[File:The gate to Udupi Town.jpg|thumb|Town gate]]\n\n==Economy==\nUdupi is becoming a major town in Karnataka. Udupi is the birthplace of the [[Syndicate Bank]], [[Corporation Bank]] and Harsha Retail, the leading retailer of coastal Karnataka.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://syndicatebank.in/scripts/aboutus.aspx |title=Brief history of Syndicate Bank |accessdate=30 August 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.corpbank.com/asp/0100text.asp?presentID=1176&headID=994 |title=History of Corporation Bank |accessdate=30 August 2011}}</ref> Udupi's economy also consists of agriculture and fishing. Small-scale industries like the [[cashew]] industry, and other food industries and milk cooperatives are the most prominent. Recently, Udupi is also making its mark in the real estate industry, greatly influenced by its neighboring spearhead [[Mangalore]].\n\nThe [[Karnataka]] government had signed a [[memorandum of understanding]] (MoU) with the Cogentrix Light and Power Industry to set up a thermal power plant in the district at [[Nandikur]]. However, because of stiff opposition from citizens and environmentalist groups, the project has been temporarily suspended. An attempt by the Nagarjuna Power Corporation to set up a similar plant at nearby [[Padubidri]] also met strong opposition. Now, the power plant has been set up, generating 1,200 MW of power under the name of Udupi Power Corporation Limited (UPCL), a subsidiary of Lanco Infra, an Andhra Pradesh-based infrastructure major. The opposition, however, continues.\n\n[[Manipal]], a suburb of Udupi, is home to the headquarters of Syndicate Bank. It is renowned as an education and medical hub.

Its modern development began in the late 19th century with the vogue for the first health resorts. In the early 20th century Portoro\u017e became one of the grandest seaside resorts in [[Adriatic sea|Adriatic]], along with [[Opatija|Abbazia]], [[Lido di Venezia|Lido]] and [[Grado, Friuli-Venezia Giulia|Grado]], then as part of the [[Austrian Littoral]].<ref>http://www.istrabenz.si/slo/turizem/950</ref> It is now one of Slovenia's major tourist areas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.piran.si/index.php?page=static&item=1&tree_root=1 |title=Piran Municipality site|accessdate=2012-01-31|ref=harv}}</ref> Located in the centre is the [[Kempinski Palace Portoro\u017e|Hotel Palace]], once one of the most important resorts for the [[Austro-Hungarian monarchy]], and currently one of the finest hotels between [[Venice]] and [[Dubrovnik]].<ref>http://www.erevija.com/clanek/1131/Hotel_Palace_-_Portoro\u017e {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304223001/http://www.erevija.com/clanek/1131/Hotel_Palace_-_Portoro%C5%BE |date=2016-03-04 }}</ref>\n\nThe settlement and its surrounding areas are served by [[Portoro\u017e Airport|Portoro\u017e International Airport]] which is located in the nearby village of [[Se\u010dovlje]].\n\n== History ==\nThe history of the settlement is directly connected to that of the neighbouring town of [[Piran]], with [[illyrians|Illyrian]] settlers already living there in the prehistoric era. They were followed by [[Celts|Celtic]] tribes, which were later conquered and annexed by the [[Roman Empire]] in 178 B.C. Archaeological finds suggest that in this period many farms and villas, also named ''villae rusticae'', were built in the area. A large development of the area followed only after the demise of the empire, with enlargement of the number of settlers seeking shelter from attacks by the [[Barbarians]].\n\nIn the 7th century, the area was a part of the [[Byzantine Empire]]. Due to increasing dissatisfaction with the feudal rule, as well as the rising power of the [[Venetian Republic]], the settlement of Pirano signed a trade treaty with [[Venice]], which included a lesser degree of autonomy.\n\n[[File:Postcard of Portoro\u017e 1912 (3).jpg|thumb|left|Portoro\u017e in 1912]]\nOne of the first religious orders who came to this area was the [[Order of Saint Benedict|Benedictines]]. \nIn the 12th century, the broader region already had four monasteries and even more churches. Among those, one of the oldest was the church of ''Our Lady of the Rosary'', which stood by the bay in the beginnings of the 13th century. Its name was ''Sancta Maria Roxe'' or ''S. Maria delle Rose'', and in 1251 the bay was named by it ''Portus sanctae Mariae de Rosa''.\n\nOne of the most important roles in the history of the settlement was the monastery of Saint Laurence, where the Benedictines healed rheumatic illnesses, ascites and other diseases with concentrated saltwater and saline mud. In 1210, the area was overtaken by the Patriarchy of Aquileia.\n\nIn the 13th century, Pirano entered a brief war from December 1282 to January 1283, in which it was defeated by the Venetian Republic. [[File:Razglednica Portoro\u017ea 1915 (3).jpg|thumb|right|250px|upright|Portoro\u017e's bath in 1915]]\n\nDuring the second Venetian rule, it was, contrary to other towns on the [[Istria]]n peninsula, loyal to Venetian rule, and as such gained special privileges within the republic, which in turn caused the local economy to boom. In 1797, Venetian rule came to a close as the [[Austrian Empire]] took over the area for a brief period until 1806. From 1806 to 1813, the entire Istrian Peninsula became part of the [[Illyrian Provinces]].\n\nA period of economic growth followed during the second Austrian rule, with enlargement of trade and locally important salt pans in nearby [[Lucija]] and [[Se\u010dovlje]]. In the aftermath of the [[World War I|Great War]], the [[Treaty of Rapallo (1920)|Treaty of Rapallo]] determined the Istrian peninsula to be from that point on a part of the [[Kingdom of Italy]].\n\nUnder the royal and then fascist rule, the area found itself amidst economic decline and civil conflicts between the populace and the state. In [[World War II]], the area had not seen much action, although the important industrial hub of Trieste suffered multiple bombings. In the aftermath of the war, the settlement found itself in the [[United Nations]]-administered [[Free Territory of Trieste]]. After the dissolution of the Trieste state it became a part of [[Socialist Federative Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.piran-pirano.si/zgodovina/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810055511/http://www.piran-pirano.si/zgodovina/ |archivedate=2014-08-10 }}</ref>\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe economy of Portoro\u017e is mainly based on tourism and the [[casino|gambling industry]]. The facilities include a marina,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marinap.si/ |title=Marina Portoro\u017e site|accessdate=2012-12-30|ref=harv}}</ref> numerous sporting facilities and several casinos, along with many hotels and apartment complexes.\n\n===Tourism development===\nIn the second half of the 19th century, the leaders of the [[Pirano]] municipality and local doctors decided to stimulate tourism in the region, by offering health treatment by concentrated salt water and salina mud, and from 1879 onwards Dr. [[Giovanni Lugnano]] the first to offer such treatment to various visitors.\nIn 1885 after several years of successful start of a new branch of industry, constructions of new complexes and villas began, and in 1890 the predecessor of the famous Hotel Palace was built. Among the new settlers were various prominent figures, such as Antonelli, Dragovina, Furian, Frennez, Langer, Rastelli, Reinlaner and Salvetti.\nBecause of the new branch of healthcare treatment that emerged in ''Porto Rose'', the ministry of interior affairs declared the settlement to be a health resort.\nIn 1908 Dr. [[Orazio Pupini]], a prominent Austrian doctor with a noticeable treatment history opened a sanatorium. He was also the main doctor of the Austrian Railways, and a member of the Austrian Doctors\u2019 Association.\nIn 1902 The [[Parenzana]] Railway system was introduced which increased the popularity of the region, but was later dissolved because of decreased interests.[[File:Portoro\u017e 1957.jpg|thumb|left|upright|240px|Palace Hotel in 1957]]\nIn 1909 the era of construction of private villas ended with opening of a much bigger building for standards at the time; the ''Palace Cur Hotel'', later known as [[Palace Hotel, Portoro\u017e|Palace Hotel]]. At the initial opening ceremony, in 1910, the Hotel Palace was already named \u00bbthe most beautiful hotel on the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] coast\u00ab. The hotel was equipped with the most modern therapeutic accessories, and for the needs of high importance guests a casino was built.\n\nThe thriving community was halted by World War I, and a few years after the war (In which they came under the [[Italy|Italian rule]]) in 1928 they included a new electric therapy among their treatment programmes. In the whole interwar period the settlement was slowly regaining its former glory when World War II  severely crippled it again. The crisis lasted until 1968 when renovations and new constructions under the new entity of [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] began to take place along the whole region. In this time they began to build the settlement's infrastructure with the casino doing the bulk of the investments in reconstructing the [[Portoro\u017e Airport|sports airfield]] in nearby [[Se\u010dovlje]] and building the multi-purpose [[Avditorij Portoro\u017e|auditorium]] in 1972.

It only lasted briefly for not more than a few months before being shut down.[[File:Portoroz (10) (3955614179).jpg|thumb|right|220px|Hotel Palace in present day]]\nThe industry faded away in the northern Adriatic region, until 1963, when ''Zavod za pospe\u0161evanje turizma'', whose president was Anton Nino Spinelli, proposed a reopening of the casino. The next year the first casino in the [[Socialist Republic of Slovenia]], and the second within [[SFRY|Yugoslavia]] beside the one in [[Opatija]] opened. In 1972, the company moved into the newly built and much larger [[Grand hotel Metropol]], where they employed around 450 people.

Its modern development began in the late 19th century with the vogue for the first health resorts. In the early 20th century Portoro\u017e became one of the grandest seaside resorts in [[Adriatic sea|Adriatic]], along with [[Opatija|Abbazia]], [[Lido di Venezia|Lido]] and [[Grado, Friuli-Venezia Giulia|Grado]], then as part of the [[Austrian Littoral]].<ref>http://www.istrabenz.si/slo/turizem/950</ref> It is now one of Slovenia's major tourist areas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.piran.si/index.php?page=static&item=1&tree_root=1 |title=Piran Municipality site|accessdate=2012-01-31|ref=harv}}</ref> Located in the centre is the [[Kempinski Palace Portoro\u017e|Hotel Palace]], once one of the most important resorts for the [[Austro-Hungarian monarchy]], and currently one of the finest hotels between [[Venice]] and [[Dubrovnik]].<ref>http://www.erevija.com/clanek/1131/Hotel_Palace_-_Portoro\u017e {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304223001/http://www.erevija.com/clanek/1131/Hotel_Palace_-_Portoro%C5%BE |date=2016-03-04 }}</ref>\n\nThe settlement and its surrounding areas are served by [[Portoro\u017e Airport|Portoro\u017e International Airport]] which is located in the nearby village of [[Se\u010dovlje]].\n\n== History ==\nThe history of the settlement is directly connected to that of the neighbouring town of [[Piran]], with [[illyrians|Illyrian]] settlers already living there in the prehistoric era. They were followed by [[Celts|Celtic]] tribes, which were later conquered and annexed by the [[Roman Empire]] in 178 B.C. Archaeological finds suggest that in this period many farms and villas, also named ''villae rusticae'', were built in the area. A large development of the area followed only after the demise of the empire, with enlargement of the number of settlers seeking shelter from attacks by the [[Barbarians]].\n\nIn the 7th century, the area was a part of the [[Byzantine Empire]]. Due to increasing dissatisfaction with the feudal rule, as well as the rising power of the [[Venetian Republic]], the settlement of Pirano signed a trade treaty with [[Venice]], which included a lesser degree of autonomy.\n\n[[File:Postcard of Portoro\u017e 1912 (3).jpg|thumb|left|Portoro\u017e in 1912]]\nOne of the first religious orders who came to this area was the [[Order of Saint Benedict|Benedictines]]. \nIn the 12th century, the broader region already had four monasteries and even more churches. Among those, one of the oldest was the church of ''Our Lady of the Rosary'', which stood by the bay in the beginnings of the 13th century. Its name was ''Sancta Maria Roxe'' or ''S. Maria delle Rose'', and in 1251 the bay was named by it ''Portus sanctae Mariae de Rosa''.\n\nOne of the most important roles in the history of the settlement was the monastery of Saint Laurence, where the Benedictines healed rheumatic illnesses, ascites and other diseases with concentrated saltwater and saline mud. In 1210, the area was overtaken by the Patriarchy of Aquileia.\n\nIn the 13th century, Pirano entered a brief war from December 1282 to January 1283, in which it was defeated by the Venetian Republic. [[File:Razglednica Portoro\u017ea 1915 (3).jpg|thumb|right|250px|upright|Portoro\u017e's bath in 1915]]\n\nDuring the second Venetian rule, it was, contrary to other towns on the [[Istria]]n peninsula, loyal to Venetian rule, and as such gained special privileges within the republic, which in turn caused the local economy to boom. In 1797, Venetian rule came to a close as the [[Austrian Empire]] took over the area for a brief period until 1806. From 1806 to 1813, the entire Istrian Peninsula became part of the [[Illyrian Provinces]].\n\nA period of economic growth followed during the second Austrian rule, with enlargement of trade and locally important salt pans in nearby [[Lucija]] and [[Se\u010dovlje]]. In the aftermath of the [[World War I|Great War]], the [[Treaty of Rapallo (1920)|Treaty of Rapallo]] determined the Istrian peninsula to be from that point on a part of the [[Kingdom of Italy]].\n\nUnder the royal and then fascist rule, the area found itself amidst economic decline and civil conflicts between the populace and the state. In [[World War II]], the area had not seen much action, although the important industrial hub of Trieste suffered multiple bombings. In the aftermath of the war, the settlement found itself in the [[United Nations]]-administered [[Free Territory of Trieste]]. After the dissolution of the Trieste state it became a part of [[Socialist Federative Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.piran-pirano.si/zgodovina/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810055511/http://www.piran-pirano.si/zgodovina/ |archivedate=2014-08-10 }}</ref>\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe economy of Portoro\u017e is mainly based on tourism and the [[casino|gambling industry]]. The facilities include a marina,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marinap.si/ |title=Marina Portoro\u017e site|accessdate=2012-12-30|ref=harv}}</ref> numerous sporting facilities and several casinos, along with many hotels and apartment complexes.\n\n===Tourism development===\nIn the second half of the 19th century, the leaders of the [[Pirano]] municipality and local doctors decided to stimulate tourism in the region, by offering health treatment by concentrated salt water and salina mud, and from 1879 onwards Dr. [[Giovanni Lugnano]] the first to offer such treatment to various visitors.\nIn 1885 after several years of successful start of a new branch of industry, constructions of new complexes and villas began, and in 1890 the predecessor of the famous Hotel Palace was built. Among the new settlers were various prominent figures, such as Antonelli, Dragovina, Furian, Frennez, Langer, Rastelli, Reinlaner and Salvetti.\nBecause of the new branch of healthcare treatment that emerged in ''Porto Rose'', the ministry of interior affairs declared the settlement to be a health resort.\nIn 1908 Dr. [[Orazio Pupini]], a prominent Austrian doctor with a noticeable treatment history opened a sanatorium. He was also the main doctor of the Austrian Railways, and a member of the Austrian Doctors\u2019 Association.\nIn 1902 The [[Parenzana]] Railway system was introduced which increased the popularity of the region, but was later dissolved because of decreased interests.[[File:Portoro\u017e 1957.jpg|thumb|left|upright|240px|Palace Hotel in 1957]]\nIn 1909 the era of construction of private villas ended with opening of a much bigger building for standards at the time; the ''Palace Cur Hotel'', later known as [[Palace Hotel, Portoro\u017e|Palace Hotel]]. At the initial opening ceremony, in 1910, the Hotel Palace was already named \u00bbthe most beautiful hotel on the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] coast\u00ab. The hotel was equipped with the most modern therapeutic accessories, and for the needs of high importance guests a casino was built.\n\nThe thriving community was halted by World War I, and a few years after the war (In which they came under the [[Italy|Italian rule]]) in 1928 they included a new electric therapy among their treatment programmes. In the whole interwar period the settlement was slowly regaining its former glory when World War II  severely crippled it again. The crisis lasted until 1968 when renovations and new constructions under the new entity of [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] began to take place along the whole region. In this time they began to build the settlement's infrastructure with the casino doing the bulk of the investments in reconstructing the [[Portoro\u017e Airport|sports airfield]] in nearby [[Se\u010dovlje]] and building the multi-purpose [[Avditorij Portoro\u017e|auditorium]] in 1972.

It only lasted briefly for not more than a few months before being shut down.[[File:Portoroz (10) (3955614179).jpg|thumb|right|220px|Hotel Palace in present day]]\nThe industry faded away in the northern Adriatic region, until 1963, when ''Zavod za pospe\u0161evanje turizma'', whose president was Anton Nino Spinelli, proposed a reopening of the casino. The next year the first casino in the [[Socialist Republic of Slovenia]], and the second within [[SFRY|Yugoslavia]] beside the one in [[Opatija]] opened.

However, the rapid growth of the world's population and its increased concentration often in hazardous environments has escalated both the frequency and severity of disasters. With the tropical climate and unstable [[landform]]s, coupled with deforestation, unplanned growth proliferation, non-engineered constructions make the disaster-prone areas more vulnerable. Developing countries suffer more or less chronically from natural disasters due to ineffective communication combined with insufficient budgetary allocation for [[Emergency management|disaster prevention and management]].\n[[File:UA Flight 175 hits WTC south tower 9-11 edit.jpeg|thumb|right|200px|[[Airplane crash]]es and [[terrorist attack]]s are examples of man-made disasters: they cause pollution, kill people, and damage property.

[[War]] and deliberate attacks may also be put in this category.\n\nOther types of induced disasters include the more cosmic scenarios of catastrophic [[global warming]], [[nuclear war]], and [[bioterrorism]].\n\nOne opinion argues that all disasters can be seen as human-made, due to human failure to introduce appropriate [[emergency management]] measures.<ref name=atrisk>Blaikie, Piers, Terry Cannon, Ian Davis & Ben Wisner.

However, the rapid growth of the world's population and its increased concentration often in hazardous environments has escalated both the frequency and severity of disasters. With the tropical climate and unstable [[landform]]s, coupled with deforestation, unplanned growth proliferation, non-engineered constructions make the disaster-prone areas more vulnerable. Developing countries suffer more or less chronically from natural disasters due to ineffective communication combined with insufficient budgetary allocation for [[Emergency management|disaster prevention and management]].\n[[File:UA Flight 175 hits WTC south tower 9-11 edit.jpeg|thumb|right|200px|[[Airplane crash]]es and [[terrorist attack]]s are examples of man-made disasters: they cause pollution, kill people, and damage property. This example is of the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001 at the World Trade Center in New York.]]\n\n===Human-made disasters===\n{{Main|Anthropogenic hazard}}\nHuman-instigated disasters are the consequence of technological or human hazards. Examples include [[stampede]]s, [[fire]]s, transport accidents, [[industrial accident]]s, [[oil spills]], [[terrorist attacks]], \n[[nuclear explosion]]s/[[nuclear radiation]]. [[War]] and deliberate attacks may also be put in this category.\n\nOther types of induced disasters include the more cosmic scenarios of catastrophic [[global warming]], [[nuclear war]], and [[bioterrorism]].\n\nOne opinion argues that all disasters can be seen as human-made, due to human failure to introduce appropriate [[emergency management]] measures.<ref name=atrisk>Blaikie, Piers, Terry Cannon, Ian Davis & Ben Wisner.
