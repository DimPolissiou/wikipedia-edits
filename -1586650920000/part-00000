The WHRC was reorganised in April 1889 and renamed the Castlecliff Railway Company (CRC). In 1953, the Wanganui Harbour Board began pressuring the [[New Zealand Railways Department]] to acquire the line, and it did so on 1 February 1956.{{sfn|Churchman & Hurst|2001|p=136}} Since then the line has been part of New Zealand's [[Rail transport in New Zealand|national rail network]].\n\nIn about 1987 the final stretch of the Wanganui Branch alongside the Whanganui River was closed, and that branch diverted to make an end-on junction with the Castlecliff Branch. As a result, the Wanganui Branch/Castlecliff Branch junction was moved to the west, nearer Castlecliff.\n\n=== Passenger services ===\n\nIn its early years, the line provided the primary means of transport between Wanganui and Castlecliff.  [[Tank locomotive|Saddle tank]] [[steam locomotive]]s provided the motive power and passenger traffic was sufficient to justify six trains each way daily.  Extra services were operated on weekends and public holidays to cater for the crowds that travelled to the beach at Castlecliff.{{sfn|Churchman & Hurst|2001|p=136}} In 1912 a [[Trams in New Zealand|tramway]] opened from central Wanganui to Castlecliff and entered into competition with the CRC.  Previously passengers from Aramoho and other locations beyond walking distance of the CRC's Wanganui terminus had been able to purchase combined train and tram tickets for trips to Castlecliff, but now that it had its own line the tramway ceased this practice.  The CRC pursued a number of measures to boost patronage, such as carrying [[baby transport|prams]] and [[bicycle]]s free.  It also considered more drastic steps such as [[railway electrification system|electrifying]] the line or purchasing a battery-electric [[railcar]] like the Railways Department's [[NZR RM class (Edison battery-electric)|Edison railcar]].<ref name=\"stewart\">{{cite book| first=Graham| last=Stewart| title=The End of the Penny Section: When Trams Ruled the Streets of New Zealand| edition=revised| location=Wellington| publisher=Grantham House| year=1993| orig-year=1973| page=105}}</ref>  However, competition from the tramways became too strong and passenger services were withdrawn in April 1932, the line remaining open for goods only.<ref name=\"quail\"/> The only passenger services over the line since then have been excursions operated by enthusiast societies such as [[SteamRail Wanganui]].\n\n=== Freight services ===\n\nThe primary reason for the existence of the Castlecliff Branch was freight.  It served the Port of Wanganui and numerous industrial [[rail siding|sidings]].<ref name=\"quail\"/>  A chemical works was established in Aramoho in 1924 and the railway was used to carry [[Nauru]] [[phosphate]] from the port. In June 1939 the ''Port Bowen'' ran aground on Castlecliff's beach and the railway was used to salvage it.  A temporary line of approximately 3&nbsp;km length was built from the CRC's terminus onto the beach to the vessel, which was dismantled and railed away.{{sfn|Churchman & Hurst|2001|p=136}}\n\nSteam locomotives worked freight services on the Castlecliff Branch into the 1960s, including members of the [[NZR Ww class|W<sup>W</sup> class]].<ref name=\"farewell\">{{cite book| first=Tony| last=Hurst| title=Farewell to Steam: Four Decades of Change on New Zealand Railways| location=Auckland| publisher=HarperCollins| year=1995| page=37}}</ref> The line was [[dieselisation|dieselised]] in the 1960s, and in its last active years [[New Zealand DSC class locomotive|DSC class]] [[switcher|shunting locomotives]] worked the line.  When they were removed from Wanganui, services ceased.\n\nOn 5 September 2006 the operator of the New Zealand network, [[Toll NZ|Toll Rail]], closed the line to all traffic and a [[railroad tie|sleeper]] was placed across the start of the line to prohibit its use.<ref name=\"Toll\">{{cite journal| journal=Toll Rail Bulletin| date=5 September 2006}}{{full citation needed|date=April 2017}}</ref>  The line was not formally closed as this required written permission from the appropriate government minister.

This led to the formation of the \"Wanganui Heads Railway Company\" (WHRC) to provide a direct rail link to the port.\n\nThe WHRC was floated in early 1882,<ref name=\"float\">{{cite news| url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&srpos=24&cl=search&d=HNS18820106.2.6&e=-------en--21----0%22Wanganui+Heads%22+railway-all| title=News and Notes| newspaper=Hawera and Normanby Star| volume=3| issue=194| date=6 January 1882| page=2| via=National Library of New Zealand, PapersPast}}</ref> and on 4 October 1882 the WHRC issued notice of its proposal to build the line under the District Railways Act of 1877.<ref name=\"borlase\">{{cite news| last1=Borlase| last2=Barnicoat| url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&srpos=14&cl=search&d=EP18821018.2.35.5&e=-------en--11----0%22Wanganui+Heads%22+railway-all| title=The Wanganui Heads Railway Company (Limited)| newspaper=Evening Post| volume=24| issue=76| date=18 October 1882| page=3| via=National Library of New Zealand, PapersPast}}</ref>  In July 1884 the WHRC called for tenders to construct the railway.<ref name=\"cross\">{{cite news| first=C.S.| last=Cross| url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&srpos=12&cl=search&d=EP18840701.2.24.3&e=-------en--11----0%22Wanganui+Heads%22+railway-all| title=The Wanganui Heads Railway Company (Limited)| newspaper=Evening Post| volume=28| issue=1| date=1 July 1884| page=4| via=National Library of New Zealand, PapersPast}}</ref>  The first sod was turned on 4 August 1884 at a public ceremony attended by approximately 400 people.<ref name=\"notago\">{{cite news| url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&srpos=2&cl=search&d=NOT18840806.2.14&e=-------en--1----0%22Wanganui+Heads%22+railway-all| title=Wanganui| newspaper=North Otago Times| volume=28| issue=3719| date=6 August 1882| page=2| via=National Library of New Zealand, PapersPast}}</ref>  Construction took a little over a year, and the line opened on 31 October 1885.<ref name=\"quail\">{{cite book| title=New Zealand Railway and Tramway Atlas| edition=fourth| editor-first=John| editor-last=Yonge| location=Essex| publisher=Quail Map Company| year=1993| page=11}}</ref>\n\n== Operation ==\n\nFor over 70 years from its opening, the Castlecliff Railway was privately owned and operated.  The WHRC was reorganised in April 1889 and renamed the Castlecliff Railway Company (CRC). In 1953, the Wanganui Harbour Board began pressuring the [[New Zealand Railways Department]] to acquire the line, and it did so on 1 February 1956.{{sfn|Churchman & Hurst|2001|p=136}} Since then the line has been part of New Zealand's [[Rail transport in New Zealand|national rail network]].\n\nIn about 1987 the final stretch of the Wanganui Branch alongside the Whanganui River was closed, and that branch diverted to make an end-on junction with the Castlecliff Branch. As a result, the Wanganui Branch/Castlecliff Branch junction was moved to the west, nearer Castlecliff.\n\n=== Passenger services ===\n\nIn its early years, the line provided the primary means of transport between Wanganui and Castlecliff.  [[Tank locomotive|Saddle tank]] [[steam locomotive]]s provided the motive power and passenger traffic was sufficient to justify six trains each way daily.  Extra services were operated on weekends and public holidays to cater for the crowds that travelled to the beach at Castlecliff.{{sfn|Churchman & Hurst|2001|p=136}} In 1912 a [[Trams in New Zealand|tramway]] opened from central Wanganui to Castlecliff and entered into competition with the CRC.  Previously passengers from Aramoho and other locations beyond walking distance of the CRC's Wanganui terminus had been able to purchase combined train and tram tickets for trips to Castlecliff, but now that it had its own line the tramway ceased this practice.  The CRC pursued a number of measures to boost patronage, such as carrying [[baby transport|prams]] and [[bicycle]]s free.  It also considered more drastic steps such as [[railway electrification system|electrifying]] the line or purchasing a battery-electric [[railcar]] like the Railways Department's [[NZR RM class (Edison battery-electric)|Edison railcar]].<ref name=\"stewart\">{{cite book| first=Graham| last=Stewart| title=The End of the Penny Section: When Trams Ruled the Streets of New Zealand| edition=revised| location=Wellington| publisher=Grantham House| year=1993| orig-year=1973| page=105}}</ref>  However, competition from the tramways became too strong and passenger services were withdrawn in April 1932, the line remaining open for goods only.<ref name=\"quail\"/> The only passenger services over the line since then have been excursions operated by enthusiast societies such as [[SteamRail Wanganui]].\n\n=== Freight services ===\n\nThe primary reason for the existence of the Castlecliff Branch was freight.  It served the Port of Wanganui and numerous industrial [[rail siding|sidings]].<ref name=\"quail\"/>  A chemical works was established in Aramoho in 1924 and the railway was used to carry [[Nauru]] [[phosphate]] from the port. In June 1939 the ''Port Bowen'' ran aground on Castlecliff's beach and the railway was used to salvage it.  A temporary line of approximately 3&nbsp;km length was built from the CRC's terminus onto the beach to the vessel, which was dismantled and railed away.{{sfn|Churchman & Hurst|2001|p=136}}\n\nSteam locomotives worked freight services on the Castlecliff Branch into the 1960s, including members of the [[NZR Ww class|W<sup>W</sup> class]].<ref name=\"farewell\">{{cite book| first=Tony| last=Hurst| title=Farewell to Steam: Four Decades of Change on New Zealand Railways| location=Auckland| publisher=HarperCollins| year=1995| page=37}}</ref> The line was [[dieselisation|dieselised]] in the 1960s, and in its last active years [[New Zealand DSC class locomotive|DSC class]] [[switcher|shunting locomotives]] worked the line.  When they were removed from Wanganui, services ceased.\n\nOn 5 September 2006 the operator of the New Zealand network, [[Toll NZ|Toll Rail]], closed the line to all traffic and a [[railroad tie|sleeper]] was placed across the start of the line to prohibit its use.<ref name=\"Toll\">{{cite journal| journal=Toll Rail Bulletin| date=5 September 2006}}{{full citation needed|date=April 2017}}</ref>  The line was not formally closed as this required written permission from the appropriate government minister.

He has been referred to as \"the most important figure on the loyalist side in pre-Revolutionary Massachusetts.\"<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=UlibMcgeiJMC&pg=PR102&lpg=PR102&dq=%22benjamin+kent%22+harvard+1727&source=bl&ots=jJi02QRLPP&sig=PzwMzM8cEelIDnPKQQl5437lzDA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiYs-mf9crPAhVK74MKHQziBYwQ6AEIITAB#v=onepage&q=%22benjamin%20kent%22%20harvard%201727&f=false p. cii]</ref>   He was a successful merchant and politician, and was active at high levels of the Massachusetts government for many years, serving as lieutenant governor and then governor from 1758 to 1774.  He was a politically polarizing figure who came to be identified by [[John Adams]] and [[Samuel Adams]] as a proponent of hated British taxes, despite his initial opposition to Parliamentary tax laws directed at the colonies. He was blamed by [[Frederick North, Lord North|Lord North]] (the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] at the time) for being a significant contributor to the tensions that led to the outbreak of the [[American Revolutionary War]].<ref>Bailyn, p. 5</ref>\n\nHutchinson's Boston mansion was ransacked in 1765 during protests against the [[Stamp Act 1765|Stamp Act]], damaging his collection of materials on early Massachusetts history. As acting governor in 1770, he exposed himself to mob attack in the aftermath of the [[Boston massacre]], after which he ordered the removal of troops from Boston to [[Castle William]]. [[Hutchinson Letters Affair|Letters of his]] calling for abridgement of colonial rights were published in 1773, further intensifying dislike of him in the colony. He was replaced as governor in May 1774 by General [[Thomas Gage]], and went into exile in England, where he advised the government on how to deal with the colonists.\n\nHutchinson had a deep interest in colonial history, collecting many historical documents. He wrote a three-volume ''History of the Province of Massachusetts Bay'' whose last volume, published posthumously, covered his own period in office. Historian [[Bernard Bailyn]] wrote of Hutchinson, \"If there was one person in America whose actions might have altered the outcome [of the protests and disputes preceding the American Revolutionary War], it was he.\"<ref>Duffy, p. 2</ref> Scholars use Hutchinson's career to represent the tragic fate of the many Loyalists marginalized by their attachment to an outmoded imperial structure at a time when the modern nation-state was emerging. Hutchinson exemplifies the difficulties experienced by Loyalists, paralyzed by his ideology and his dual loyalties to America and Britain. He sacrificed his love for Massachusetts to his loyalty to [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]], where he spent his last years in unhappy exile.<ref>Cheng, Eileen, \"On the Margins,\"  ''Early American Studies'' (2013) 11#1 pp. 98\u2013116</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nThomas Hutchinson was born on 9 September 1711 in the [[North End, Boston|North End]] of Boston, the fourth of twelve children of Thomas and Sarah Foster Hutchinson.<ref>Hosmer, p. 1</ref>  He was descended from early New England settlers, including [[Anne Hutchinson]] and her son [[Edward Hutchinson (captain)|Edward Hutchinson]], and his parents were both from well-to-do merchant families. His father was involved in the family mercantile trade but was also active in political, military, and charitable circles and served on the provincial council.<ref>Bailyn, pp. 9\u201310</ref>  His younger brother was [[Foster Hutchinson (judge)|Foster Hutchinson]].\n\n[[File:Margaret Sanford Hutchinson (1750) IMG 2871.JPG|left|thumb|200px|Margaret Sanford Hutchinson, wife of Thomas Hutchinson (1750)]]\n\nYoung Thomas entered [[Harvard College]] at twelve, graduating in 1727.<ref>Hosmer, p. 2</ref>  His father introduced him to the business world early, and he displayed remarkable business acumen. According to his autobiographical sketch of his childhood, Hutchinson turned a modest gift from his father of \"five [[quintal]]s of fish\" into between \u00a3400 and \u00a3500 by the time he was 21.<ref>Bailyn, p. 12</ref> In 1732, he received some exposure to politics when he accompanied Governor [[Jonathan Belcher]] on a voyage to [[Casco Bay]] for negotiations with the [[Abenaki]] of [[District of Maine|Maine]], then part of Massachusetts.  The voyage was made in a vessel of which Hutchinson was part owner.<ref>Hosmer, p. 3</ref>  In 1734, he married Margaret Sanford, a granddaughter of [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations|Rhode Island]] Governor [[Peleg Sanford]].  The Sanford and Hutchinson families had a long history of business and personal connections; Margaret, in fact, was a distant relative.<ref>Bailyn, pp. 12, 30</ref><ref>Mrs. Hutchinson was also descended from Rhode Island governor [[William Coddington]].</ref> The marriage secured a political alliance between Hutchinson and Andrew and Peter Oliver which lasted long after Margaret's death. Margaret Sanford's sister Mary (1713-1773) was the second wife of Andrew Oliver. Likewise, a daughter of Thomas Hutchinson married a son of Peter Oliver. The Oliver brothers were also related to Massachusetts governor [[Jonathan Belcher]] and to New Hampshire lieutenant governors William Partridge and George Vaughan (Harvard Class of 1696). The couple had twelve children, only five of whom survived to adulthood, before Margaret died in 1754 from complications of childbirth.<ref>Bailyn, p. 29</ref>\n\n==Legislator and councillor==\nIn 1737 Hutchinson entered politics, being elected as a [[Boston Board of Selectmen|Boston selectman]], and later in the year, to a seat in the [[Massachusetts General Court|General Court]] (the provincial assembly).<ref>Hosmer, p. 4</ref>  He spoke out against the province's practice of issuing [[bills of credit]] (as a form of paper currency), whose inflationary drop in value wrought havoc in the economy.  This position was unpopular with the populist party in the province, and Hutchinson was voted out in the 1739 election.<ref>Hosmer, pp. 21\u201322</ref>  He was sent to England as an agent to plead on behalf of property owners affected by [[George II of Great Britain|King George II's]] decision concerning the boundary line between Massachusetts and [[Province of New Hampshire|New Hampshire]] which significantly favored New Hampshire.  Hutchinson's embassy was unsuccessful, although he returned with a bequest to Harvard for the construction of a new chapel; [[Holden Chapel]], built with these funds, still stands today.<ref>Bailyn, p. 14</ref>\n\n[[File:William Shirley.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Governor [[William Shirley]]]]\nIn 1742, Hutchinson was again elected to the General Court, where he served until 1749, being the body's speaker from 1746 to 1749.<ref>Hosmer, pp. 25\u201326</ref>  His continued advocacy of currency reforms so annoyed the populist faction that the need to guard his properties in Boston and [[Milton, Massachusetts|Milton]] from possible mob action was discussed.<ref>Hosmer, p. 26</ref>  When the British government was convinced to refund the province's expense for mounting the [[Siege of Louisbourg (1745)|1745 Louisbourg expedition]], Hutchinson seized upon the idea of using the massive payment (about \u00a3180,000 in gold and silver) to retire the province's paper currency. Despite significant opposition, Hutchinson successfully navigated a bill implementing the idea through the assembly's general court in 1749; it received the agreement of the Governor's Council, and also the signature of Governor [[William Shirley]].  Many of the bill's opponents were pleasantly surprised when the exchange of paper for specie did not cause any financial shocks, and Hutchinson's popularity soared.<ref>Hosmer, pp. 27\u201330</ref>\n\nDespite the success, Hutchinson was voted out of the assembly in 1749.  He was, however, immediately appointed to the Governor's Council.<ref>Hosmer, p. 36</ref> In 1749 he headed a commission to arrange a treaty with the Indians in the [[District of Maine]],<ref>Walmsley, p. 27</ref> which was then part of Massachusetts, and he served on boundary commissions to settle disputes with [[Connecticut Colony|Connecticut]] and [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations|Rhode Island]]. In 1752 he was appointed judge of probate and a justice of the Common Pleas. Following the outbreak of the [[French and Indian War]] in 1754, he was a delegate to the [[Albany Congress|Albany Convention]].  In that meeting he took a leading part in the discussions, working with [[Benjamin Franklin]] to draft a plan for colonial union.  Hutchinson agreed with Franklin that the present disunity endangered the British colonies, and that decisive action must be taken to knit the too-often-competing colonies into a coherent whole. Most important, the report drafted by Hutchinson concluded that the colonies must be encouraged to establish \"a Union of His Majesty's several governments on the continent, that so their councils, treasure, and strength may be employed in due proportion against their common enemy\".<ref>Brands, p. 237</ref>\n\nHutchinson's wife died quite suddenly in 1754; Hutchinson thereafter threw himself into his work.<ref>Walmsley, p. 28</ref> His work was not entirely of a political nature: in a humanitarian streak he supported [[Acadian]] refugees who [[Expulsion of the Acadians|had been expelled]] from their [[Nova Scotia]] homelands, even though this support of Roman Catholics did not gain him friends in Protestant Massachusetts.  He was also sensitive to the needs of the military men involved in the war, often giving aid to needy families of veterans.<ref>Walmsley, p. 29</ref>\n\n==Lieutenant Governor of Massachusetts==\n[[File:Thomas Pownall.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Governor [[Thomas Pownall]]]]\nWhen Governor Shirley's political opponents engineered his recall in 1756, Hutchinson sought and received the endorsement of the British military leader [[John Campbell, 4th Earl of Loudoun|Lord Loudoun]] in an effort to succeed Shirley as governor. During this time Hutchinson was the leading politician in the province due to the age and infirmity of Lieutenant Governor [[Spencer Phips]].<ref>Walmsley, p. 30</ref> Hutchinson's application was unsuccessful, but he did receive an appointment as lieutenant governor in 1758, serving under [[Thomas Pownall]]. Hutchinson's relationship with Pownall was awkward, for Pownall was at the center of political activities that dislodged Governor Shirley, under whose patronage Hutchinson had risen in power and influence.  Pownall cultivated relations with the populist factions in the state, and sought to remove the influence of Shirley supporters, sometimes asking Hutchinson to turn against people he (Hutchinson) had earlier supported.  This Hutchinson refused to do, since he saw these actions as harming the province's stability and taking place at \"the caprice of the governor\".<ref>Bailyn, pp. 41\u201342</ref>  Pownall, whose mistrust of Hutchinson was reciprocated, requested to leave to return to England in late 1759. The political opposition of Shirley supporters and the death of some of his leading populist supporters may have contributed to this decision.<ref>Waters and Schutz, p. 557</ref>  He departed the province on 3 June 1760, leaving Hutchinson as acting governor.<ref>Bailyn, p. 44</ref>  Several months later Pownall's replacement, [[Sir Francis Bernard, 1st Baronet|Francis Bernard]], arrived to take the reins of power.<ref>Bailyn, p. 45</ref>\n\n===Writs of assistance===\nOne of Bernard's early acts was the appointment of Hutchinson instead of [[James Otis, Sr.]], as Chief Justice of the [[Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court|Massachusetts Superior Court of Judicature]].  This action by itself turned the province's populists, whose vocal leaders included Otis and [[James Otis, Jr.|his son James Jr.]], against both Hutchinson and Bernard, with long term consequences to Hutchinson's reputation. Hutchinson, with no legal training, had not sought the post, and some emerging legal thinkers, notably a rising young lawyer named [[John Adams]], were also outraged.<ref>Bailyn, pp. 47\u201351</ref>\n\nIn 1761 Hutchinson brought upon himself a storm of protest and criticism by issuing [[writ of assistance|writs of assistance]], documents that authorised essentially arbitrary searches by customs officials.  Although some had been issued (ironically over Hutchinson's objections) in earlier years, the writs he authorised were in some cases renewals of existing writs necessitated by the accession of [[George III of Great Britain|King George III]] to the throne.  Adams and the Otises seized on the issue to rail against his monopolisation of power (since he was also a lieutenant governor and sat on the council) and lack of legal qualifications for the post of chief justice.<ref>Bailyn, p. 54</ref>\n\n===Taxes and the Stamp Act===\n[[File:John Adams - by Charles Willson Peale.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[John Adams]] (portrait by [[Charles Willson Peale]]) was opposed to Hutchinson's ascent to the highest judicial post in the province.]]\nWhen the [[Sugar Act]] was being discussed in Parliament in 1763, proposals were put forward to send Hutchinson to England to represent the colony's opposition to the proposal. Governor Bernard, however, objected to sending the sitting lieutenant governor, and the bill was enacted. Much colonial protest followed, and Hutchinson was in agreement with vocal opponents like the Otises (who around this time began using the phrase \"[[no taxation without representation]]\") that the law harmed the Massachusetts economy.<ref>Hosmer, pp. 72\u201373</ref>  In the ensuing debates, however, differences emerged between Hutchinson and others over Parliament's supremacy and the feasibility of having formal colonial representation there,<ref>Hosmer, pp. 74\u201375</ref> which were exacerbated by the personal animosity that had developed between Hutchinson and the Otises.  Led by James Otis, Jr. and [[Oxenbridge Thacher]], the anti-Parliament faction seized on every minor dispute to rail against Hutchinson and his faction's monopolisation of power. Hutchinson was at first dismissive of these ongoing political attacks, believing that his opponents were either misguided or misled.  Biographer Andrew Walmsley observes that Hutchinson at this stage seriously underestimated the impact of these attacks in building a coherent opposition to crown control, and in the damage it was doing to his own reputation.<ref>Walmsley, pp. 50\u201354</ref>\n\nIn debates leading up to the passage of the 1765 [[Stamp Act 1765|Stamp Act]], both Hutchinson and Bernard quietly warned London not to proceed.  Hutchinson in particular wrote that \"It cannot be good to tax the Americans ... You will lose more than you gain.\"<ref>Hosmer, p. 81</ref> Hutchinson's letters even shaped the political discourse in Parliament. [[Isaac Barre]], a prominent Member of Parliament, drew heavily on the themes presented in Hutchinson's letters: he proclaimed that \"Your oppressions planted them. . . . They grew by your neglect. . . . They have nobly taken up arms in your defense\" on the floor of Parliament in opposition to the Stamp Act.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} When the assembly met to draft a petition to London on the matter in October 1764, Hutchinson opposed the inclusion of the radicals' language, and eventually pushed through a more moderate statement of opposition.  However, the Massachusetts petition was seen as weak in comparison to those prepared by other colonies, and Hutchinson was claimed to be secretly seeking to promote the Stamp Act.  He was also accused of \"treachery\" and \"betraying his country\".<ref>Bailyn, p. 65</ref>  News of the act's passage propelled one of the most vocal opponents of Parliamentary supremacy, [[Samuel Adams]], into a larger role in provincial politics.<ref>Hosmer, p. 82</ref>  Hutchinson privately supported calls for its repeal, but his unwillingness to publicly oppose the act merely provided additional fuel for his opponents.<ref>Walmsley, pp. 60\u201363</ref>\n\n===Mob violence===\n[[File:Foster Hutchinson house FleetSt Boston.png|thumb|left|Hutchinson house, Garden Court Street, [[North End, Boston|North End]], Boston]]\nHutchinson's brother-in-law, colonial secretary [[Andrew Oliver]], was given the job of \"stamp master\", with responsibility for implementing the act in the province. Although Hutchinson apparently had no hand in this assignment, his opponents were quick to accuse him of further duplicity.<ref>Morgan (1948), pp. 459\u2013492</ref>  His attempts to explain his position only fuelled the opposition, who recounted his early unpopular acts and questioned his motives in those deeds.<ref>Bailyn, pp. 66\u201367</ref>  On 13 August 1765, mobs descended on Oliver's home and office, ransacking both.  The next night Hutchinson's Boston mansion was surrounded, and the crowd demanded that he formally deny arguing in favour of the Stamp Act in his correspondence with London. He refused, and only the intervention of a moderate leader prevented any action that night.<ref>Bailyn, pp. 68\u201369</ref>\n\nTwelve days later, on the evening of 26 August, a mob again formed outside of his mansion, and this time they would not be denied.  Described by one architectural historian as \"the first developed example of provincial [[Palladianism]] in New England,\"<ref>Bailyn, p. 10</ref> the house was broken into (Hutchinson and his family narrowly escaping), and systematically ransacked.  The house finishings ([[Panelling#Wainscot panelling|wainscoting]] and other decorative woodwork) were effectively destroyed, and even the building's cupola was taken down in violence that lasted the entire night.  The family silver, furniture, and other items were stolen or destroyed (although some items were eventually returned), and Hutchinson's collection of historically important manuscripts was scattered. Hutchinson was then working on the final volume of his three volume history of the Massachusetts Bay colony. Many pages of the work were lost that night and had to be recreated.<ref>Hosmer, pp. 91\u201394</ref> Hutchinson's detailed inventory (reprinted by biographer James Kendall Hosmer) valued the damage done at more than \u00a32,200, and he eventually received over \u00a33,100 from the province for his troubles.<ref>Hosmer, pp. 123,351\u2013361</ref>  Hutchinson and his family temporarily took refuge at [[Castle William]],<ref>Hosmer, p. 98</ref> and thereafter took up primary residence at Hutchinson's estate in Milton.<ref>Hosmer, p. 116</ref>\n\n==Governor of Massachusetts==\n[[File:Proclamation Governor Thomas Hutchinson Province of Massachusetts Bay.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A proclamation issued by Hutchinson in 1771]]\nBecause of the controversy over the Stamp Act, the radical faction came to control both the assembly and the governor's council in 1766, and Hutchinson was denied a seat on the governor's council.<ref>Hosmer, p. 117</ref>  Amid increased furor after the passage of the 1767 [[Townshend Acts]], Governor Bernard requested and received [[British Army]] troops to protect crown officials.  Letters written by Bernard describing conditions in the province were acquired by the radical opposition and published, leading to his recall. Bernard left for England on 1 August 1769, leaving Hutchinson as acting governor.<ref>Galvin, pp. 178, 180\u2013182, 188</ref>  Hutchinson was unsuccessful in his attempts to distance himself from the unpopular Bernard administration, and he continued to be attacked in the assembly and the local press.<ref>Walmsley, pp. 102\u2013103</ref>  Despite this, he continued to lobby for a formal appointment as governor.  He categorically refused to again serve as lieutenant governor under another governor, preferring instead a posting elsewhere, or to resign the lieutenant governorship.<ref>Bailyn, p. 149</ref>\n\nHutchinson was still acting governor when protests over the Townshend taxes erupted into the [[Boston Massacre]] on 5 March 1770, when British soldiers fired into a crowd, killing five people.<ref>Bailyn, p. 157</ref>  Hutchinson went to the scene in the aftermath of the shooting, and promised that justice would be applied fairly. He had all of the British soldiers involved in the incident arrested the next day, but ongoing unrest in the city compelled him to request the withdrawal of British troops from the city to Castle William.<ref>Bailyn, pp. 158\u2013162</ref> Hutchinson was able to postpone the trial for almost 6 months to allow anger to settle and for Adams to prepare a solid case. The soldiers were eventually tried, and two were convicted of manslaughter, although their sentences were reduced.  The episode shook Hutchinson's confidence in his ability to manage affairs in the province, and he penned a resignation letter.<ref>Bailyn, p. 164</ref>\n\nGovernor Bernard had, in the meantime, taken up Hutchinson's cause in London.  In March 1771 Hutchinson's commission as governor arrived in Boston, having been approved by the king while his resignation letter was going the other way.  (Colonial secretary [[Wills Hill, 1st Marquess of Downshire|Lord Hillsborough]] rejected his resignation.)<ref>Bailyn, pp. 164\u2013166</ref>  The instructions sent with the commission were fairly strict, and left Hutchinson relatively little room to manoeuvre politically.  Instructions that particularly galled Samuel Adams included one restricting the meetings of the governor's council, and another limiting the appointment of colonial agents to individuals having the governor's approval.<ref>Bailyn, p. 169</ref>\n\nOne of Hutchinson's instructions was to relocate the provincial assembly from Boston to [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], where it would be less under the influence of radical Boston politics.  This modest demand, accomplished by executive order, resulted in howls of complaint of gubernatorial arbitrariness in the assembly, and an exchange of arguments, rebuttals, and counterarguments between Hutchinson and the assembly that ran for thousands of pages and lasted until 1772.<ref>Bailyn, p. 171</ref> The nature of the affair furthered the radical cause, whose proponents painted Hutchinson's action as a bold and devious attempt to further the executive prerogative.<ref>Bailyn, p. 173</ref> The radicals were further outraged when Hutchinson announced in 1772 that his salary, which had previously been subject to appropriation by the assembly, would be paid by the crown instead. This was seen by the radicals as a further usurpation of power that rightfully belonged in the province.<ref>Galvin, p. 232</ref>  Written debates with the assembly extended to the role of Parliament in governing the policies, and further deepened the divide between it and Hutchinson. They also raised flags elsewhere in the colonies and in England, where observers noted that Hutchinson's arguments had effectively driven moderates in the province to join with the political hardliners.<ref>Bailyn, p. 211</ref>\n\n===Letters affair and Tea Party===\n{{main|Hutchinson Letters Affair|Boston Tea Party}}\n[[File:The able doctor, or America swallowing the bitter draught (NYPL Hades-248165-425086).jpg|thumb|left|Engraving by [[Paul Revere]] depicting British reaction to the [[Boston Tea Party]]]]\nThe Massachusetts debate reached a pitch in 1772 when Hutchinson, in a speech to the assembly, argued that either the colony was wholly subject to Parliament, or that it was effectively independent.  The assembly's response, authored by John Adams, Samuel Adams, and [[Joseph Hawley (Massachusetts)|Joseph Hawley]], countered that the colonial charter granted autonomy.<ref>Ferling, pp. 79\u201380</ref>  In England the colonial secretary, [[William Legge, 2nd Earl of Dartmouth|Lord Dartmouth]], insisted to colonial agent Benjamin Franklin that the Massachusetts assembly retract its response.  Franklin had acquired a packet of letters,<ref>Penegar, p. 27</ref> written in the late 1760s by Hutchinson and other colonial officials, from which he concluded that Hutchinson and Oliver had mischaracterized the situation in the colonies, and thus misled Parliament.  Believing that wider knowledge of these letters would focus colonial anger away from Parliament and at those who had written the misleading letters,<ref name=Morgan187/>  Franklin sent the letters to [[Thomas Cushing]], the speaker of the Massachusetts assembly, in December 1772.<ref name=Morgan187>Morgan (2003), p. 187</ref>  He insisted to Cushing that they not be published or widely circulated, because he was not \"at liberty to make the letters public.\"<ref>Wright, p. 225</ref>  The letters came into the hands of Samuel Adams, then serving as the clerk of the assembly, who engineered their publication in June 1773.<ref>Alexander, p. 150</ref><ref>Galvin, p. 254</ref><ref>Bailyn, p. 240</ref>  Franklin's belief was only partially vindicated: the publication of the letters unleashed a torrent of vitriol against Hutchinson, but did nothing to lessen opposition to Parliamentary policy: instead the opposition saw the letters as confirmation of a conspiracy against their rights.<ref>Bailyn, pp. 240\u2013245</ref>  The letters were reprinted throughout the colonies, and Hutchinson was [[burned in effigy]] in places as far away as [[Philadelphia]] during the uproar.<ref>Bailyn, p. 269</ref>\n\nHutchinson's letters, written between 1767 and 1769 to [[Thomas Whately]], a retired former leading member of the British government, included the observation that it was impossible for colonists to have the full rights they would have in the home country, essentially requiring an \"abridgement of what are called [[Rights of Englishmen|English liberties]]\".<ref>Bailyn, pp. 226\u2013227</ref>  He made no specific proposals on ''how'' the colonial government should be reformed, writing in a letter that was not among those published, \"I can think of nothing but what will produce as great an evil as that which it may remove or will be of a very uncertain event.\"<ref>Bailyn, p. 228</ref>  Letters by Andrew Oliver, in contrast, specifically proposed that the governor's council, whose members were then elected by the assembly with the governor's consent, be changed to one whose members were appointed by the crown.<ref>Penegar, p. 32</ref>\n\nAlthough much of what Hutchinson wrote in the letters was not particularly new, Samuel Adams masterfully manipulated the contents and implications of some of the statements by Hutchinson and Oliver to suggest they were conspiring with officials in London to deprive the colonists of their rights.<ref>Ferling, pp. 80\u201381</ref>  Hutchinson was defended in print by provincial attorney general [[Jonathan Sewall]], who claimed that Hutchinson was not actually expressing desired changes in the state of affairs, but ruminating instead on possible consequences of present conditions.<ref>Bailyn, pp. 244\u2013246</ref>\n\nThe Massachusetts assembly drafted a petition to the Board of Trade demanding Hutchinson's removal from office, and Hutchinson, concerned with the effect the letter publication and the assembly petition would have in London, requested permission to come to England to defend himself.<ref>Galvin, p. 258</ref>  The letter authorizing his return did not reach Boston until November 1773, too late for him to depart that year;<ref>Bailyn, pp. 258\u2013259</ref> his request and the assembly's petition would not be heard until early 1774.<ref name=Isaacson275/>\n\n[[Image:Benjamin Franklin at the Court of St. James - NARA - 518216.jpg|thumb|right|[[Benjamin Franklin]] at the [[Privy Council]] hearing in 1774]]\nIn the meantime, Parliament had repealed most of the Townshend taxes (keeping only the one on tea), and passed the [[Tea Act]], which authorised the [[British East India Company]] to ship tea directly to the colonies, eliminating colonial merchants from its supply chain and undercutting the price of smuggled Dutch tea.<ref>Knollenberg, p. 71</ref><ref>Labaree, pp. 46\u201351</ref>  This caused colonial merchants all over the North American colonies to organise opposition to the deliveries of the company's tea.<ref>Labaree, p. 102</ref> In Massachusetts the arrival of ships carrying tea in November 1773 brought about a crisis, since duties were to be paid on dutiable cargo within twenty days of a ship's arrival.  Hutchinson and his sons were among the businessmen to whom the company had consigned its tea, although Hutchinson disclaimed any official role in the choice of consignee.<ref>Bailyn, pp. 259\u2013260</ref>  Other cargo was unloaded from the ships, but armed protestors patrolled the docks to ensure the tea was not landed.  Hutchinson took a hard line, refusing to allow the tea ships to leave the harbour despite citywide protests that the tea be sent back to England, and insisting that the duty be paid and the tea landed.  When the twenty-day deadline arrived on 16 December, protestors (some in Indian disguise) boarded the ships that night and [[Boston Tea Party|dumped the tea into the harbour]].<ref>Bailyn, p. 262</ref>\n\nHutchinson justified the hardline stance that contributed to the crisis by claiming it was his duty as governor to uphold the revenue laws, while American opponents such as [[James Bowdoin]] observed that he could have just as easily refused to accept the tea when it was clear that popular sentiment would make it impossible to land the tea. British critics complained that he should have asked the British troops in Boston to intervene.  After it became known that other tea ships sent to North America had turned back, Hutchinson continued to justify his actions in letters to England, anticipating hearings on the matter once he arrived there.<ref>Bailyn, pp. 262\u2013263</ref>\n\nWhen the Board of Trade met to consider the assembly's petition to recall Hutchinson, it also discussed the tea party.  Franklin, as colonial agent, was forced to listen to a barrage of criticism, and was dismissed as colonial postmaster general.  The assembly's petition was dismissed as \"groundless\" and \"vexatious\", but Hutchinson's request for leave was granted.<ref name=Isaacson275>Isaacson, pp. 275\u2013278</ref><ref>Hosmer, p. 312</ref>  In May 1774 General [[Thomas Gage]] arrived in Boston to take over as governor, and to implement the \"[[Coercive Acts]]\" Parliament had passed as punishment for the tea party.  Hutchinson, believing he would only be away from Massachusetts temporarily, sailed for England on 1 June 1774.<ref>Hosmer, pp. 314\u2013315</ref>\n\n==Exile==\n[[File:Foster Hutchinson, d. 1799, Old Burying Ground, Halifax, Nova Scotia.jpg|thumb|Thomas Hutchinson's brother was judge [[Foster Hutchinson (judge)|Foster Hutchinson]], d. 1799, a [[Loyalist]] who escaped to [[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]], [[Old Burying Ground (Halifax, Nova Scotia)]]]]\nUpon his arrival in London, Hutchinson was granted an audience with the king, who questioned him on affairs in North America, and he was well received by Rockingham, Dartmouth, and [[Frederick North, Lord North|Lord North]], the prime minister.<ref>Galvin, p. 280</ref>  In his interview with North he expressed dismay at the terms of the [[Massachusetts Government Act]], and sought to establish a basis for the eventual repeal of the [[Boston Port Act]], whose enactment by Governor Gage had a crippling effect on the province's economy.  One part of the Government Act, the appointment by the crown of the governor's council, was something he had long opposed without formal hearings on the matter, but even colonial authorities sympathetic to his view believed events had by 1774 gone too far for the British political establishment to support alternatives.<ref>Bailyn, p. 279</ref>  At the outbreak of the [[American Revolutionary War]] in April 1775 his Milton mansion was seized for use as an army barracks, and a trunk containing copies of much of his correspondence fell into rebel hands.<ref>Bailyn, p. 334</ref>\n\nAs the war progressed, Hutchinson was criticised by the [[Whig (British political party)|Whig]]s in Parliament, which he answered in an unpublished manuscript.  He continued to be treated favourably by the king, but was compelled to refuse the offer of a [[baronetcy]] because most of his fortune was lost due to his exile,<ref>Walmsley, pp. 154\u2013158</ref> and became marginalised from power as prosecution of the war took center stage.<ref>Bailyn, pp. 344\u2013355</ref>  On 4 July 1776, Hutchinson was awarded an honorary [[Juris Doctor|doctorate of law]] by [[Oxford University]].  His enemies in Massachusetts continued to attack his reputation, and his exile made it impossible to effectively dispute the charges they made.  His properties, like those of other exiled Loyalists, were seized and sold off by the state; his Milton home was eventually purchased by [[James Warren (politician)|James]] and [[Mercy Otis Warren]] (the latter being the sister of his long-time enemy James Otis, Jr.)<ref>Galvin, p. 298</ref><ref>Walmsley, pp. 155\u2013157</ref>\n\nBitter and disillusioned about his forced exile, and grieving the loss of his daughter Peggy in 1777, Hutchinson continued to work on his history of the colony which was the fruit of many decades of research. Two volumes were published in his lifetime: Volume 1 of the ''History of Massachusetts'' appeared in 1764, and Volume 2 in 1767.  The third volume would be published posthumously, and included his own tenure as lieutenant governor and governor.  At the same time he worked to complete a history of the Hutchinson family, in which he encapsulated details on political affairs not found elsewhere.<ref>Bailyn, pp. 359\u2013369</ref>  He suffered a stroke and died at [[Brompton, London|Brompton]] in west London on 3 June 1780, aged 68, and was buried in [[Croydon Minster]] in south London.<ref>Bailyn, p. 373</ref><ref>''Memoir of Thomas Hutchinson'', p. 310</ref>\n\n==Legacy and memory==\nBecause of his central role as the main focal point for the opposition to royal rule, Hutchinson's reputation in America was generally quite poor. He was often seen as a traitor to his native Massachusetts and to the cause of freedom.   John Adams was characteristically harsh in his assessment of him, calling him \"avaricious\" and describing him as a \"courtier\" who manipulated those at higher levels of power to achieve his aims.<ref>Bailyn, p. 2</ref>  He was also criticized by British political figures: Thomas Pownall continued to disagree with Hutchinson after the latter's exile, Francis Bernard (despite working on Hutchinson's behalf) disapproved of some of his actions, and Lord North believed the publication of his letters to be responsible for the outbreak of the war.<ref>Bailyn, p. 3</ref>\n\nBiographers in the 20th century have, however, rehabilitated his reputation, seeking to explain how and why he came to be demonized in this way.<ref>Walmsley, pp. xiii\u2013xv</ref>  In recent decades historians have typically portrayed Hutchinson as a tragic figure torn between his rulers in London and his people in Massachusetts. [[Barbara Tuchman]], for example, portrays Hutchinson as an \"ill-fated\" and \"tragic figure.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Barbara W. Tuchman|first=|title=The March of Folly: From Troy to Vietnam|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v5YlBtzklvQC&pg=PA150|year=2011|publisher=Random House|page=150}}</ref>  British scholar [[David Kenneth Fieldhouse]] says his tragedy emerged because he was \"a victim of the clash of two ideologies, his own archaic and static, that of his opponents contemporary and dynamic.\"<ref>Cited in {{cite book|last=Duffy|first=Shannon E.|title=An Enlightened American: The Political Ideology of Thomas Hutchinson on the Eve of the Revolutionary Crisis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qzIO3N0RlaQC&pg=PA10|year=2008|publisher=ProQuest|page=10}}</ref>  Carl L. Becker, a prominent American historian wrote: \"Nothing would have pleased him [Hutchinson] more than that New England should have shown its emancipation from provincialism by meriting the good will of the King. His irritation with America in general and Boston in particular was the irritation of a proud and possessive father with a beloved but wayward child who fails to do him credit in high places.\" Bailyn has changed his own interpretation over the years. In the 1970s he saw Hutchinson as a bewildered pragmatist.  By 2004 he portrayed Hutchinson as a premodern thinker locked in an old mindset at a time when [[The Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] ideas were taking hold thanks to thinkers such as [[Adam Smith]] and [[Tom Paine]].<ref>Duffy p 10</ref>\n\n[[File:1750 painting of Thomas Hutchinson IMG 2873.JPG|200px|right|thumb|Hutchinson painting (1750)]]\n\nRemnants of Hutchinson's country estate in Milton have been preserved.

He has been referred to as \"the most important figure on the loyalist side in pre-Revolutionary Massachusetts.\"<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=UlibMcgeiJMC&pg=PR102&lpg=PR102&dq=%22benjamin+kent%22+harvard+1727&source=bl&ots=jJi02QRLPP&sig=PzwMzM8cEelIDnPKQQl5437lzDA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiYs-mf9crPAhVK74MKHQziBYwQ6AEIITAB#v=onepage&q=%22benjamin%20kent%22%20harvard%201727&f=false p. cii]</ref>   He was a successful merchant and politician, and was active at high levels of the Massachusetts government for many years, serving as lieutenant governor and then governor from 1758 to 1774.  He was a politically polarizing figure who came to be identified by [[John Adams]] and [[Samuel Adams]] as a proponent of hated British taxes, despite his initial opposition to Parliamentary tax laws directed at the colonies. He was blamed by [[Frederick North, Lord North|Lord North]] (the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] at the time) for being a significant contributor to the tensions that led to the outbreak of the [[American Revolutionary War]].<ref>Bailyn, p. 5</ref>\n\nHutchinson's Boston mansion was ransacked in 1765 during protests against the [[Stamp Act 1765|Stamp Act]], damaging his collection of materials on early Massachusetts history. As acting governor in 1770, he exposed himself to mob attack in the aftermath of the [[Boston massacre]], after which he ordered the removal of troops from Boston to [[Castle William]]. [[Hutchinson Letters Affair|Letters of his]] calling for abridgement of colonial rights were published in 1773, further intensifying dislike of him in the colony. He was replaced as governor in May 1774 by General [[Thomas Gage]], and went into exile in England, where he advised the government on how to deal with the colonists.\n\nHutchinson had a deep interest in colonial history, collecting many historical documents. He wrote a three-volume ''History of the Province of Massachusetts Bay'' whose last volume, published posthumously, covered his own period in office. Historian [[Bernard Bailyn]] wrote of Hutchinson, \"If there was one person in America whose actions might have altered the outcome [of the protests and disputes preceding the American Revolutionary War], it was he.\"<ref>Duffy, p. 2</ref> Scholars use Hutchinson's career to represent the tragic fate of the many Loyalists marginalized by their attachment to an outmoded imperial structure at a time when the modern nation-state was emerging. Hutchinson exemplifies the difficulties experienced by Loyalists, paralyzed by his ideology and his dual loyalties to America and Britain. He sacrificed his love for Massachusetts to his loyalty to [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]], where he spent his last years in unhappy exile.<ref>Cheng, Eileen, \"On the Margins,\"  ''Early American Studies'' (2013) 11#1 pp. 98\u2013116</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nThomas Hutchinson was born on 9 September 1711 in the [[North End, Boston|North End]] of Boston, the fourth of twelve children of Thomas and Sarah Foster Hutchinson.<ref>Hosmer, p. 1</ref>  He was descended from early New England settlers, including [[Anne Hutchinson]] and her son [[Edward Hutchinson (captain)|Edward Hutchinson]], and his parents were both from well-to-do merchant families. His father was involved in the family mercantile trade but was also active in political, military, and charitable circles and served on the provincial council.<ref>Bailyn, pp. 9\u201310</ref>  His younger brother was [[Foster Hutchinson (judge)|Foster Hutchinson]].\n\n[[File:Margaret Sanford Hutchinson (1750) IMG 2871.JPG|left|thumb|200px|Margaret Sanford Hutchinson, wife of Thomas Hutchinson (1750)]]\n\nYoung Thomas entered [[Harvard College]] at twelve, graduating in 1727.<ref>Hosmer, p. 2</ref>  His father introduced him to the business world early, and he displayed remarkable business acumen. According to his autobiographical sketch of his childhood, Hutchinson turned a modest gift from his father of \"five [[quintal]]s of fish\" into between \u00a3400 and \u00a3500 by the time he was 21.<ref>Bailyn, p. 12</ref> In 1732, he received some exposure to politics when he accompanied Governor [[Jonathan Belcher]] on a voyage to [[Casco Bay]] for negotiations with the [[Abenaki]] of [[District of Maine|Maine]], then part of Massachusetts.  The voyage was made in a vessel of which Hutchinson was part owner.<ref>Hosmer, p. 3</ref>  In 1734, he married Margaret Sanford, a granddaughter of [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations|Rhode Island]] Governor [[Peleg Sanford]].  The Sanford and Hutchinson families had a long history of business and personal connections; Margaret, in fact, was a distant relative.<ref>Bailyn, pp. 12, 30</ref><ref>Mrs. Hutchinson was also descended from Rhode Island governor [[William Coddington]].</ref> The marriage secured a political alliance between Hutchinson and Andrew and Peter Oliver which lasted long after Margaret's death. Margaret Sanford's sister Mary (1713-1773) was the second wife of Andrew Oliver. Likewise, a daughter of Thomas Hutchinson married a son of Peter Oliver. The Oliver brothers were also related to Massachusetts governor [[Jonathan Belcher]] and to New Hampshire lieutenant governors William Partridge and George Vaughan (Harvard Class of 1696). The couple had twelve children, only five of whom survived to adulthood, before Margaret died in 1754 from complications of childbirth.<ref>Bailyn, p. 29</ref>\n\n==Legislator and councillor==\nIn 1737 Hutchinson entered politics, being elected as a [[Boston Board of Selectmen|Boston selectman]], and later in the year, to a seat in the [[Massachusetts General Court|General Court]] (the provincial assembly).<ref>Hosmer, p. 4</ref>  He spoke out against the province's practice of issuing [[bills of credit]] (as a form of paper currency), whose inflationary drop in value wrought havoc in the economy.  This position was unpopular with the populist party in the province, and Hutchinson was voted out in the 1739 election.<ref>Hosmer, pp. 21\u201322</ref>  He was sent to England as an agent to plead on behalf of property owners affected by [[George II of Great Britain|King George II's]] decision concerning the boundary line between Massachusetts and [[Province of New Hampshire|New Hampshire]] which significantly favored New Hampshire.  Hutchinson's embassy was unsuccessful, although he returned with a bequest to Harvard for the construction of a new chapel; [[Holden Chapel]], built with these funds, still stands today.<ref>Bailyn, p. 14</ref>\n\n[[File:William Shirley.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Governor [[William Shirley]]]]\nIn 1742, Hutchinson was again elected to the General Court, where he served until 1749, being the body's speaker from 1746 to 1749.<ref>Hosmer, pp. 25\u201326</ref>  His continued advocacy of currency reforms so annoyed the populist faction that the need to guard his properties in Boston and [[Milton, Massachusetts|Milton]] from possible mob action was discussed.<ref>Hosmer, p. 26</ref>  When the British government was convinced to refund the province's expense for mounting the [[Siege of Louisbourg (1745)|1745 Louisbourg expedition]], Hutchinson seized upon the idea of using the massive payment (about \u00a3180,000 in gold and silver) to retire the province's paper currency. Despite significant opposition, Hutchinson successfully navigated a bill implementing the idea through the assembly's general court in 1749; it received the agreement of the Governor's Council, and also the signature of Governor [[William Shirley]].  Many of the bill's opponents were pleasantly surprised when the exchange of paper for specie did not cause any financial shocks, and Hutchinson's popularity soared.<ref>Hosmer, pp. 27\u201330</ref>\n\nDespite the success, Hutchinson was voted out of the assembly in 1749.  He was, however, immediately appointed to the Governor's Council.<ref>Hosmer, p. 36</ref> In 1749 he headed a commission to arrange a treaty with the Indians in the [[District of Maine]],<ref>Walmsley, p. 27</ref> which was then part of Massachusetts, and he served on boundary commissions to settle disputes with [[Connecticut Colony|Connecticut]] and [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations|Rhode Island]]. In 1752 he was appointed judge of probate and a justice of the Common Pleas. Following the outbreak of the [[French and Indian War]] in 1754, he was a delegate to the [[Albany Congress|Albany Convention]].  In that meeting he took a leading part in the discussions, working with [[Benjamin Franklin]] to draft a plan for colonial union.  Hutchinson agreed with Franklin that the present disunity endangered the British colonies, and that decisive action must be taken to knit the too-often-competing colonies into a coherent whole. Most important, the report drafted by Hutchinson concluded that the colonies must be encouraged to establish \"a Union of His Majesty's several governments on the continent, that so their councils, treasure, and strength may be employed in due proportion against their common enemy\".<ref>Brands, p. 237</ref>\n\nHutchinson's wife died quite suddenly in 1754; Hutchinson thereafter threw himself into his work.<ref>Walmsley, p. 28</ref> His work was not entirely of a political nature: in a humanitarian streak he supported [[Acadian]] refugees who [[Expulsion of the Acadians|had been expelled]] from their [[Nova Scotia]] homelands, even though this support of Roman Catholics did not gain him friends in Protestant Massachusetts.  He was also sensitive to the needs of the military men involved in the war, often giving aid to needy families of veterans.<ref>Walmsley, p. 29</ref>\n\n==Lieutenant Governor of Massachusetts==\n[[File:Thomas Pownall.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Governor [[Thomas Pownall]]]]\nWhen Governor Shirley's political opponents engineered his recall in 1756, Hutchinson sought and received the endorsement of the British military leader [[John Campbell, 4th Earl of Loudoun|Lord Loudoun]] in an effort to succeed Shirley as governor. During this time Hutchinson was the leading politician in the province due to the age and infirmity of Lieutenant Governor [[Spencer Phips]].<ref>Walmsley, p. 30</ref> Hutchinson's application was unsuccessful, but he did receive an appointment as lieutenant governor in 1758, serving under [[Thomas Pownall]]. Hutchinson's relationship with Pownall was awkward, for Pownall was at the center of political activities that dislodged Governor Shirley, under whose patronage Hutchinson had risen in power and influence.  Pownall cultivated relations with the populist factions in the state, and sought to remove the influence of Shirley supporters, sometimes asking Hutchinson to turn against people he (Hutchinson) had earlier supported.  This Hutchinson refused to do, since he saw these actions as harming the province's stability and taking place at \"the caprice of the governor\".<ref>Bailyn, pp. 41\u201342</ref>  Pownall, whose mistrust of Hutchinson was reciprocated, requested to leave to return to England in late 1759. The political opposition of Shirley supporters and the death of some of his leading populist supporters may have contributed to this decision.<ref>Waters and Schutz, p. 557</ref>  He departed the province on 3 June 1760, leaving Hutchinson as acting governor.<ref>Bailyn, p. 44</ref>  Several months later Pownall's replacement, [[Sir Francis Bernard, 1st Baronet|Francis Bernard]], arrived to take the reins of power.<ref>Bailyn, p. 45</ref>\n\n===Writs of assistance===\nOne of Bernard's early acts was the appointment of Hutchinson instead of [[James Otis, Sr.]], as Chief Justice of the [[Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court|Massachusetts Superior Court of Judicature]].  This action by itself turned the province's populists, whose vocal leaders included Otis and [[James Otis, Jr.|his son James Jr.]], against both Hutchinson and Bernard, with long term consequences to Hutchinson's reputation. Hutchinson, with no legal training, had not sought the post, and some emerging legal thinkers, notably a rising young lawyer named [[John Adams]], were also outraged.<ref>Bailyn, pp. 47\u201351</ref>\n\nIn 1761 Hutchinson brought upon himself a storm of protest and criticism by issuing [[writ of assistance|writs of assistance]], documents that authorised essentially arbitrary searches by customs officials.  Although some had been issued (ironically over Hutchinson's objections) in earlier years, the writs he authorised were in some cases renewals of existing writs necessitated by the accession of [[George III of Great Britain|King George III]] to the throne.  Adams and the Otises seized on the issue to rail against his monopolisation of power (since he was also a lieutenant governor and sat on the council) and lack of legal qualifications for the post of chief justice.<ref>Bailyn, p. 54</ref>\n\n===Taxes and the Stamp Act===\n[[File:John Adams - by Charles Willson Peale.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[John Adams]] (portrait by [[Charles Willson Peale]]) was opposed to Hutchinson's ascent to the highest judicial post in the province.]]\nWhen the [[Sugar Act]] was being discussed in Parliament in 1763, proposals were put forward to send Hutchinson to England to represent the colony's opposition to the proposal. Governor Bernard, however, objected to sending the sitting lieutenant governor, and the bill was enacted. Much colonial protest followed, and Hutchinson was in agreement with vocal opponents like the Otises (who around this time began using the phrase \"[[no taxation without representation]]\") that the law harmed the Massachusetts economy.<ref>Hosmer, pp. 72\u201373</ref>  In the ensuing debates, however, differences emerged between Hutchinson and others over Parliament's supremacy and the feasibility of having formal colonial representation there,<ref>Hosmer, pp. 74\u201375</ref> which were exacerbated by the personal animosity that had developed between Hutchinson and the Otises.  Led by James Otis, Jr. and [[Oxenbridge Thacher]], the anti-Parliament faction seized on every minor dispute to rail against Hutchinson and his faction's monopolisation of power. Hutchinson was at first dismissive of these ongoing political attacks, believing that his opponents were either misguided or misled.  Biographer Andrew Walmsley observes that Hutchinson at this stage seriously underestimated the impact of these attacks in building a coherent opposition to crown control, and in the damage it was doing to his own reputation.<ref>Walmsley, pp. 50\u201354</ref>\n\nIn debates leading up to the passage of the 1765 [[Stamp Act 1765|Stamp Act]], both Hutchinson and Bernard quietly warned London not to proceed.  Hutchinson in particular wrote that \"It cannot be good to tax the Americans ... You will lose more than you gain.\"<ref>Hosmer, p. 81</ref> Hutchinson's letters even shaped the political discourse in Parliament. [[Isaac Barre]], a prominent Member of Parliament, drew heavily on the themes presented in Hutchinson's letters: he proclaimed that \"Your oppressions planted them. . . . They grew by your neglect. . . . They have nobly taken up arms in your defense\" on the floor of Parliament in opposition to the Stamp Act.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} When the assembly met to draft a petition to London on the matter in October 1764, Hutchinson opposed the inclusion of the radicals' language, and eventually pushed through a more moderate statement of opposition.  However, the Massachusetts petition was seen as weak in comparison to those prepared by other colonies, and Hutchinson was claimed to be secretly seeking to promote the Stamp Act.  He was also accused of \"treachery\" and \"betraying his country\".<ref>Bailyn, p. 65</ref>  News of the act's passage propelled one of the most vocal opponents of Parliamentary supremacy, [[Samuel Adams]], into a larger role in provincial politics.<ref>Hosmer, p. 82</ref>  Hutchinson privately supported calls for its repeal, but his unwillingness to publicly oppose the act merely provided additional fuel for his opponents.<ref>Walmsley, pp. 60\u201363</ref>\n\n===Mob violence===\n[[File:Foster Hutchinson house FleetSt Boston.png|thumb|left|Hutchinson house, Garden Court Street, [[North End, Boston|North End]], Boston]]\nHutchinson's brother-in-law, colonial secretary [[Andrew Oliver]], was given the job of \"stamp master\", with responsibility for implementing the act in the province. Although Hutchinson apparently had no hand in this assignment, his opponents were quick to accuse him of further duplicity.<ref>Morgan (1948), pp. 459\u2013492</ref>  His attempts to explain his position only fuelled the opposition, who recounted his early unpopular acts and questioned his motives in those deeds.<ref>Bailyn, pp. 66\u201367</ref>  On 13 August 1765, mobs descended on Oliver's home and office, ransacking both.  The next night Hutchinson's Boston mansion was surrounded, and the crowd demanded that he formally deny arguing in favour of the Stamp Act in his correspondence with London. He refused, and only the intervention of a moderate leader prevented any action that night.<ref>Bailyn, pp. 68\u201369</ref>\n\nTwelve days later, on the evening of 26 August, a mob again formed outside of his mansion, and this time they would not be denied.  Described by one architectural historian as \"the first developed example of provincial [[Palladianism]] in New England,\"<ref>Bailyn, p. 10</ref> the house was broken into (Hutchinson and his family narrowly escaping), and systematically ransacked.  The house finishings ([[Panelling#Wainscot panelling|wainscoting]] and other decorative woodwork) were effectively destroyed, and even the building's cupola was taken down in violence that lasted the entire night.  The family silver, furniture, and other items were stolen or destroyed (although some items were eventually returned), and Hutchinson's collection of historically important manuscripts was scattered. Hutchinson was then working on the final volume of his three volume history of the Massachusetts Bay colony. Many pages of the work were lost that night and had to be recreated.<ref>Hosmer, pp. 91\u201394</ref> Hutchinson's detailed inventory (reprinted by biographer James Kendall Hosmer) valued the damage done at more than \u00a32,200, and he eventually received over \u00a33,100 from the province for his troubles.<ref>Hosmer, pp. 123,351\u2013361</ref>  Hutchinson and his family temporarily took refuge at [[Castle William]],<ref>Hosmer, p. 98</ref> and thereafter took up primary residence at Hutchinson's estate in Milton.<ref>Hosmer, p. 116</ref>\n\n==Governor of Massachusetts==\n[[File:Proclamation Governor Thomas Hutchinson Province of Massachusetts Bay.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A proclamation issued by Hutchinson in 1771]]\nBecause of the controversy over the Stamp Act, the radical faction came to control both the assembly and the governor's council in 1766, and Hutchinson was denied a seat on the governor's council.<ref>Hosmer, p. 117</ref>  Amid increased furor after the passage of the 1767 [[Townshend Acts]], Governor Bernard requested and received [[British Army]] troops to protect crown officials.  Letters written by Bernard describing conditions in the province were acquired by the radical opposition and published, leading to his recall. Bernard left for England on 1 August 1769, leaving Hutchinson as acting governor.<ref>Galvin, pp. 178, 180\u2013182, 188</ref>  Hutchinson was unsuccessful in his attempts to distance himself from the unpopular Bernard administration, and he continued to be attacked in the assembly and the local press.<ref>Walmsley, pp. 102\u2013103</ref>  Despite this, he continued to lobby for a formal appointment as governor.  He categorically refused to again serve as lieutenant governor under another governor, preferring instead a posting elsewhere, or to resign the lieutenant governorship.<ref>Bailyn, p. 149</ref>\n\nHutchinson was still acting governor when protests over the Townshend taxes erupted into the [[Boston Massacre]] on 5 March 1770, when British soldiers fired into a crowd, killing five people.<ref>Bailyn, p. 157</ref>  Hutchinson went to the scene in the aftermath of the shooting, and promised that justice would be applied fairly. He had all of the British soldiers involved in the incident arrested the next day, but ongoing unrest in the city compelled him to request the withdrawal of British troops from the city to Castle William.<ref>Bailyn, pp. 158\u2013162</ref> Hutchinson was able to postpone the trial for almost 6 months to allow anger to settle and for Adams to prepare a solid case. The soldiers were eventually tried, and two were convicted of manslaughter, although their sentences were reduced.  The episode shook Hutchinson's confidence in his ability to manage affairs in the province, and he penned a resignation letter.<ref>Bailyn, p. 164</ref>\n\nGovernor Bernard had, in the meantime, taken up Hutchinson's cause in London.  In March 1771 Hutchinson's commission as governor arrived in Boston, having been approved by the king while his resignation letter was going the other way.  (Colonial secretary [[Wills Hill, 1st Marquess of Downshire|Lord Hillsborough]] rejected his resignation.)<ref>Bailyn, pp. 164\u2013166</ref>  The instructions sent with the commission were fairly strict, and left Hutchinson relatively little room to manoeuvre politically.  Instructions that particularly galled Samuel Adams included one restricting the meetings of the governor's council, and another limiting the appointment of colonial agents to individuals having the governor's approval.<ref>Bailyn, p. 169</ref>\n\nOne of Hutchinson's instructions was to relocate the provincial assembly from Boston to [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], where it would be less under the influence of radical Boston politics.  This modest demand, accomplished by executive order, resulted in howls of complaint of gubernatorial arbitrariness in the assembly, and an exchange of arguments, rebuttals, and counterarguments between Hutchinson and the assembly that ran for thousands of pages and lasted until 1772.<ref>Bailyn, p. 171</ref> The nature of the affair furthered the radical cause, whose proponents painted Hutchinson's action as a bold and devious attempt to further the executive prerogative.<ref>Bailyn, p. 173</ref> The radicals were further outraged when Hutchinson announced in 1772 that his salary, which had previously been subject to appropriation by the assembly, would be paid by the crown instead. This was seen by the radicals as a further usurpation of power that rightfully belonged in the province.<ref>Galvin, p. 232</ref>  Written debates with the assembly extended to the role of Parliament in governing the policies, and further deepened the divide between it and Hutchinson. They also raised flags elsewhere in the colonies and in England, where observers noted that Hutchinson's arguments had effectively driven moderates in the province to join with the political hardliners.<ref>Bailyn, p. 211</ref>\n\n===Letters affair and Tea Party===\n{{main|Hutchinson Letters Affair|Boston Tea Party}}\n[[File:The able doctor, or America swallowing the bitter draught (NYPL Hades-248165-425086).jpg|thumb|left|Engraving by [[Paul Revere]] depicting British reaction to the [[Boston Tea Party]]]]\nThe Massachusetts debate reached a pitch in 1772 when Hutchinson, in a speech to the assembly, argued that either the colony was wholly subject to Parliament, or that it was effectively independent.  The assembly's response, authored by John Adams, Samuel Adams, and [[Joseph Hawley (Massachusetts)|Joseph Hawley]], countered that the colonial charter granted autonomy.<ref>Ferling, pp. 79\u201380</ref>  In England the colonial secretary, [[William Legge, 2nd Earl of Dartmouth|Lord Dartmouth]], insisted to colonial agent Benjamin Franklin that the Massachusetts assembly retract its response.  Franklin had acquired a packet of letters,<ref>Penegar, p. 27</ref> written in the late 1760s by Hutchinson and other colonial officials, from which he concluded that Hutchinson and Oliver had mischaracterized the situation in the colonies, and thus misled Parliament.  Believing that wider knowledge of these letters would focus colonial anger away from Parliament and at those who had written the misleading letters,<ref name=Morgan187/>  Franklin sent the letters to [[Thomas Cushing]], the speaker of the Massachusetts assembly, in December 1772.<ref name=Morgan187>Morgan (2003), p. 187</ref>  He insisted to Cushing that they not be published or widely circulated, because he was not \"at liberty to make the letters public.\"<ref>Wright, p. 225</ref>  The letters came into the hands of Samuel Adams, then serving as the clerk of the assembly, who engineered their publication in June 1773.<ref>Alexander, p. 150</ref><ref>Galvin, p. 254</ref><ref>Bailyn, p. 240</ref>  Franklin's belief was only partially vindicated: the publication of the letters unleashed a torrent of vitriol against Hutchinson, but did nothing to lessen opposition to Parliamentary policy: instead the opposition saw the letters as confirmation of a conspiracy against their rights.<ref>Bailyn, pp. 240\u2013245</ref>  The letters were reprinted throughout the colonies, and Hutchinson was [[burned in effigy]] in places as far away as [[Philadelphia]] during the uproar.<ref>Bailyn, p. 269</ref>\n\nHutchinson's letters, written between 1767 and 1769 to [[Thomas Whately]], a retired former leading member of the British government, included the observation that it was impossible for colonists to have the full rights they would have in the home country, essentially requiring an \"abridgement of what are called [[Rights of Englishmen|English liberties]]\".<ref>Bailyn, pp. 226\u2013227</ref>  He made no specific proposals on ''how'' the colonial government should be reformed, writing in a letter that was not among those published, \"I can think of nothing but what will produce as great an evil as that which it may remove or will be of a very uncertain event.\"<ref>Bailyn, p. 228</ref>  Letters by Andrew Oliver, in contrast, specifically proposed that the governor's council, whose members were then elected by the assembly with the governor's consent, be changed to one whose members were appointed by the crown.<ref>Penegar, p. 32</ref>\n\nAlthough much of what Hutchinson wrote in the letters was not particularly new, Samuel Adams masterfully manipulated the contents and implications of some of the statements by Hutchinson and Oliver to suggest they were conspiring with officials in London to deprive the colonists of their rights.<ref>Ferling, pp. 80\u201381</ref>  Hutchinson was defended in print by provincial attorney general [[Jonathan Sewall]], who claimed that Hutchinson was not actually expressing desired changes in the state of affairs, but ruminating instead on possible consequences of present conditions.<ref>Bailyn, pp. 244\u2013246</ref>\n\nThe Massachusetts assembly drafted a petition to the Board of Trade demanding Hutchinson's removal from office, and Hutchinson, concerned with the effect the letter publication and the assembly petition would have in London, requested permission to come to England to defend himself.<ref>Galvin, p. 258</ref>  The letter authorizing his return did not reach Boston until November 1773, too late for him to depart that year;<ref>Bailyn, pp. 258\u2013259</ref> his request and the assembly's petition would not be heard until early 1774.<ref name=Isaacson275/>\n\n[[Image:Benjamin Franklin at the Court of St. James - NARA - 518216.jpg|thumb|right|[[Benjamin Franklin]] at the [[Privy Council]] hearing in 1774]]\nIn the meantime, Parliament had repealed most of the Townshend taxes (keeping only the one on tea), and passed the [[Tea Act]], which authorised the [[British East India Company]] to ship tea directly to the colonies, eliminating colonial merchants from its supply chain and undercutting the price of smuggled Dutch tea.<ref>Knollenberg, p. 71</ref><ref>Labaree, pp. 46\u201351</ref>  This caused colonial merchants all over the North American colonies to organise opposition to the deliveries of the company's tea.<ref>Labaree, p. 102</ref> In Massachusetts the arrival of ships carrying tea in November 1773 brought about a crisis, since duties were to be paid on dutiable cargo within twenty days of a ship's arrival.  Hutchinson and his sons were among the businessmen to whom the company had consigned its tea, although Hutchinson disclaimed any official role in the choice of consignee.<ref>Bailyn, pp. 259\u2013260</ref>  Other cargo was unloaded from the ships, but armed protestors patrolled the docks to ensure the tea was not landed.  Hutchinson took a hard line, refusing to allow the tea ships to leave the harbour despite citywide protests that the tea be sent back to England, and insisting that the duty be paid and the tea landed.  When the twenty-day deadline arrived on 16 December, protestors (some in Indian disguise) boarded the ships that night and [[Boston Tea Party|dumped the tea into the harbour]].<ref>Bailyn, p. 262</ref>\n\nHutchinson justified the hardline stance that contributed to the crisis by claiming it was his duty as governor to uphold the revenue laws, while American opponents such as [[James Bowdoin]] observed that he could have just as easily refused to accept the tea when it was clear that popular sentiment would make it impossible to land the tea. British critics complained that he should have asked the British troops in Boston to intervene.  After it became known that other tea ships sent to North America had turned back, Hutchinson continued to justify his actions in letters to England, anticipating hearings on the matter once he arrived there.<ref>Bailyn, pp. 262\u2013263</ref>\n\nWhen the Board of Trade met to consider the assembly's petition to recall Hutchinson, it also discussed the tea party.  Franklin, as colonial agent, was forced to listen to a barrage of criticism, and was dismissed as colonial postmaster general.  The assembly's petition was dismissed as \"groundless\" and \"vexatious\", but Hutchinson's request for leave was granted.<ref name=Isaacson275>Isaacson, pp. 275\u2013278</ref><ref>Hosmer, p. 312</ref>  In May 1774 General [[Thomas Gage]] arrived in Boston to take over as governor, and to implement the \"[[Coercive Acts]]\" Parliament had passed as punishment for the tea party.  Hutchinson, believing he would only be away from Massachusetts temporarily, sailed for England on 1 June 1774.<ref>Hosmer, pp. 314\u2013315</ref>\n\n==Exile==\n[[File:Foster Hutchinson, d. 1799, Old Burying Ground, Halifax, Nova Scotia.jpg|thumb|Thomas Hutchinson's brother was judge [[Foster Hutchinson (judge)|Foster Hutchinson]], d. 1799, a [[Loyalist]] who escaped to [[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]], [[Old Burying Ground (Halifax, Nova Scotia)]]]]\nUpon his arrival in London, Hutchinson was granted an audience with the king, who questioned him on affairs in North America, and he was well received by Rockingham, Dartmouth, and [[Frederick North, Lord North|Lord North]], the prime minister.<ref>Galvin, p. 280</ref>  In his interview with North he expressed dismay at the terms of the [[Massachusetts Government Act]], and sought to establish a basis for the eventual repeal of the [[Boston Port Act]], whose enactment by Governor Gage had a crippling effect on the province's economy.  One part of the Government Act, the appointment by the crown of the governor's council, was something he had long opposed without formal hearings on the matter, but even colonial authorities sympathetic to his view believed events had by 1774 gone too far for the British political establishment to support alternatives.<ref>Bailyn, p. 279</ref>  At the outbreak of the [[American Revolutionary War]] in April 1775 his Milton mansion was seized for use as an army barracks, and a trunk containing copies of much of his correspondence fell into rebel hands.<ref>Bailyn, p. 334</ref>\n\nAs the war progressed, Hutchinson was criticised by the [[Whig (British political party)|Whig]]s in Parliament, which he answered in an unpublished manuscript.  He continued to be treated favourably by the king, but was compelled to refuse the offer of a [[baronetcy]] because most of his fortune was lost due to his exile,<ref>Walmsley, pp. 154\u2013158</ref> and became marginalised from power as prosecution of the war took center stage.<ref>Bailyn, pp. 344\u2013355</ref>  On 4 July 1776, Hutchinson was awarded an honorary [[Juris Doctor|doctorate of law]] by [[Oxford University]].  His enemies in Massachusetts continued to attack his reputation, and his exile made it impossible to effectively dispute the charges they made.  His properties, like those of other exiled Loyalists, were seized and sold off by the state; his Milton home was eventually purchased by [[James Warren (politician)|James]] and [[Mercy Otis Warren]] (the latter being the sister of his long-time enemy James Otis, Jr.)<ref>Galvin, p. 298</ref><ref>Walmsley, pp. 155\u2013157</ref>\n\nBitter and disillusioned about his forced exile, and grieving the loss of his daughter Peggy in 1777, Hutchinson continued to work on his history of the colony which was the fruit of many decades of research. Two volumes were published in his lifetime: Volume 1 of the ''History of Massachusetts'' appeared in 1764, and Volume 2 in 1767.  The third volume would be published posthumously, and included his own tenure as lieutenant governor and governor.  At the same time he worked to complete a history of the Hutchinson family, in which he encapsulated details on political affairs not found elsewhere.<ref>Bailyn, pp. 359\u2013369</ref>  He suffered a stroke and died at [[Brompton, London|Brompton]] in west London on 3 June 1780, aged 68, and was buried in [[Croydon Minster]] in south London.<ref>Bailyn, p. 373</ref><ref>''Memoir of Thomas Hutchinson'', p. 310</ref>\n\n==Legacy and memory==\nBecause of his central role as the main focal point for the opposition to royal rule, Hutchinson's reputation in America was generally quite poor. He was often seen as a traitor to his native Massachusetts and to the cause of freedom.   John Adams was characteristically harsh in his assessment of him, calling him \"avaricious\" and describing him as a \"courtier\" who manipulated those at higher levels of power to achieve his aims.<ref>Bailyn, p. 2</ref>  He was also criticized by British political figures: Thomas Pownall continued to disagree with Hutchinson after the latter's exile, Francis Bernard (despite working on Hutchinson's behalf) disapproved of some of his actions, and Lord North believed the publication of his letters to be responsible for the outbreak of the war.<ref>Bailyn, p. 3</ref>\n\nBiographers in the 20th century have, however, rehabilitated his reputation, seeking to explain how and why he came to be demonized in this way.<ref>Walmsley, pp. xiii\u2013xv</ref>  In recent decades historians have typically portrayed Hutchinson as a tragic figure torn between his rulers in London and his people in Massachusetts. [[Barbara Tuchman]], for example, portrays Hutchinson as an \"ill-fated\" and \"tragic figure.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Barbara W. Tuchman|first=|title=The March of Folly: From Troy to Vietnam|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v5YlBtzklvQC&pg=PA150|year=2011|publisher=Random House|page=150}}</ref>  British scholar [[David Kenneth Fieldhouse]] says his tragedy emerged because he was \"a victim of the clash of two ideologies, his own archaic and static, that of his opponents contemporary and dynamic.\"<ref>Cited in {{cite book|last=Duffy|first=Shannon E.|title=An Enlightened American: The Political Ideology of Thomas Hutchinson on the Eve of the Revolutionary Crisis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qzIO3N0RlaQC&pg=PA10|year=2008|publisher=ProQuest|page=10}}</ref>  Carl L. Becker, a prominent American historian wrote: \"Nothing would have pleased him [Hutchinson] more than that New England should have shown its emancipation from provincialism by meriting the good will of the King. His irritation with America in general and Boston in particular was the irritation of a proud and possessive father with a beloved but wayward child who fails to do him credit in high places.\" Bailyn has changed his own interpretation over the years. In the 1970s he saw Hutchinson as a bewildered pragmatist.  By 2004 he portrayed Hutchinson as a premodern thinker locked in an old mindset at a time when [[The Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] ideas were taking hold thanks to thinkers such as [[Adam Smith]] and [[Tom Paine]].<ref>Duffy p 10</ref>\n\n[[File:1750 painting of Thomas Hutchinson IMG 2873.JPG|200px|right|thumb|Hutchinson painting (1750)]]\n\nRemnants of Hutchinson's country estate in Milton have been preserved.

It is open to the public, and a nearby property features [[Gov. Thomas Hutchinson's Ha-ha|a ha-ha]] constructed for Hutchinson in 1771.

Shatner was not as successful as the others, but during the 1960s he \"became a working actor who showed up on time, knew his lines, worked cheap and always answered his phone.\" His motto was \"Work equals work\", however, Shatner's willingness to take any role, no matter how \"forgettable\", likely hurt his career.{{r|jordan20100903}} He took the lead role in [[Roger Corman]]'s movie ''[[The Intruder (1962 film)|The Intruder]]'' (1962) and received very good reviews for his significant role in the [[Stanley Kramer]] film ''[[Judgment at Nuremberg]]'' (1961).

The program lasted only 13 episodes. Shatner starred in the 1966 [[Gothic fiction|gothic horror]] film ''[[Incubus (1966 film)|Incubus]]'' (Esperanto: Inkubo,) the second feature-length movie ever made with all dialogue spoken in [[Esperanto]].

With very little money and few acting prospects, Shatner lost his home and lived in a truck-bed camper in the [[San Fernando Valley]] until small roles turned into higher-paying jobs. Shatner refers to this part of his life as \"that period\", a humbling time during which he would take any odd job, including small party appearances, to support his family.\n\nShatner again appeared in \"[[:wikt:schlock|schlock]]\" films, such as Corman's ''[[Big Bad Mama]]'' (1974) and the horror film ''[[The Devil's Rain (film)|The Devil's Rain]]'' (1975),{{r|jordan20100903}} ''[[Kingdom of the Spiders]]'' (1977), and the TV movie ''[[The Horror at 37,000 Feet]]''.

In a notable 1977 appearance, he gave an illegal clue (\"the ''blessed''\" for ''Things That Are Blessed'' when he had intended to say \"the [[Virgin Mary]]\") at the top of the pyramid ($200), which deprived the contestant of a big money win.

Shatner and the other original ''Star Trek'' cast members returned to their roles when Paramount produced ''[[Star Trek: The Motion Picture]]'', released in 1979. He played Kirk in the next six ''Star Trek'' films, ending with the character's death in ''[[Star Trek Generations]]'' (1994). Some later appearances in the role are in the movie sequences of the video game ''[[Star Trek: Starfleet Academy (video game)|Starfleet Academy]]'' (1997), briefly for a [[Lap giraffe|DirecTV advertisement]] using footage from ''Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country'' running from late summer 2006, and the [[85th Academy Awards|2013 Academy Awards]], in which he reprised the role for a comedic interlude with host [[Seth MacFarlane]].\n\nAlthough Trekkies resurrected ''Star Trek'' after cancellation, in a 1986 ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' sketch about a ''Star Trek'' convention, Shatner advised a room full of fans to \"get a life\".<ref name=\"jenkins1992\">{{cite book |last=Jenkins |first=Henry |authorlink=Henry Jenkins |year=1992 |title=Textual Poachers: Television Fans & Participatory Culture |url=https://books.google.com/?id=71U9-cOx_ZwC&lpg=PP1&dq=trekkie%20trekker&pg=PA9#v=onepage&q=jindra&f=false |location=New York |publisher=[[Routledge]] |pages=9\u201313 | isbn=978-0-415-90572-5 |oclc=26055104 |lccn=92019400 |accessdate=2013-11-12}}</ref>{{r|jordan20100903}} The much-discussed sketch accurately portrayed his feelings about Trekkies, which the actor had previously discussed in interviews.{{r|jenkins1992}} Shatner had been their unwilling subject of adoration for years; as early as April 1968, a group attempted to rip his clothes off as the actor left [[GE Building|30 Rockefeller Plaza]],<ref name=\"lowry19680329\">{{cite news |last=Lowry |first=Cynthia |date=March 29, 1968 |title=TV Fans Save Space Ship Enterprise From Mothballs |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=kSgsAAAAIBAJ&sjid=jMYEAAAAIBAJ&pg=821,4386600 |newspaper=[[TimesDaily|Florence Times\u2014Tri-Cities Daily]] |location=Florence, AL |publisher=Tri-Cities Newspapers, Inc. |agency=Associated Press |page=15 |accessdate=2013-11-12}}</ref> and he stopped attending conventions for more than a decade during the 1970s and 1980s.<ref name=\"martin19860907\">{{cite news | title=Star Trek: Five-Year Mission Turns Into 20 | work=San Francisco Chronicle | date=September 7, 1986 | author=Martin, Sue | page=49}}</ref> Shatner also appeared in the film ''[[Free Enterprise (film)|Free Enterprise]]'' in 1998, in which he played himself and tried to dispel the Kirk image of himself from the view of the film's two lead characters. He also has found an outlet in spoofing the cavalier, almost superhuman, persona of Captain Kirk in films such as ''[[Airplane II: The Sequel]]'' (1982) and ''[[National Lampoon, Incorporated|National Lampoon's]] [[Loaded Weapon 1]]'' (1993). In 1994, he starred as the murderer in the ''[[Columbo]]'' episode \"[[List of Columbo episodes#Season 10 and specials|Butterfly in Shades of Grey]]\".\n\nBesides the ''Star Trek'' films, Shatner landed a starring role on television as the titular police officer ''[[T.

He narrated a television miniseries shot in New Zealand ''[[A Twist in the Tale (1998 TV series)|A Twist in the Tale]]'' (1998). In the television series ''[[3rd Rock from the Sun]]'', Shatner appeared in several 1999\u20132000 episodes as the \"[[Big Giant Head]]\", a high-ranking officer from the same alien planet as the Solomon family who becomes a womanizing party-animal on Earth.

The LAPD ruled out foul play, and the case was closed.\n\nSpeaking to the press shortly after his wife's death, a clearly shaken and emotional Shatner said that she \"meant everything\" to him, and called her his \"beautiful soulmate\".<ref name=\"quirk\">{{cite journal |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=William Shatner: Captain Quirk |url=http://bulletin.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=149333 |journal=[[The Bulletin (Australian periodical)|The Bulletin]] |date=October 3, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061027171515/http://bulletin.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=149333 |archivedate=October 27, 2006 |accessdate=2013-11-12}}</ref> Shatner urged the public to support Friendly House, a nonprofit organization that helps women re-establish themselves in the community after suffering from alcoholism and drug addiction.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scifi.com/sfw/issue124/news.html|title=Science Fiction News of the Week |website=Science Fiction Weekly |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325130127/http://www.scifi.com/sfw/issue124/news.html |archivedate=March 25, 2009 |accessdate=2012-03-07}}</ref> He later told [[Larry King]] in an interview that \"my wife, whom I loved dearly, and who loved me, was suffering with a disease that we don't like to talk about: alcoholism. And she met a tragic ending because of it.\"<ref name=\"quirk\" />\n\nIn his 2008 book ''Up Till Now: The Autobiography'', Shatner discusses how Leonard Nimoy helped take Nerine to treatment for her alcoholism. Shatner writes in an excerpt from his book:\n\n{{quote|Leonard Nimoy's personal experience of alcoholism now came to play a central role in my life and it helped us bond together in a way I never could have imagined in the early days of ''Star Trek''. After Nerine [Kidd] and I had been to dinner with Leonard and Susan Nimoy one evening, Leonard called and said: \"Bill, you know she's an alcoholic?\" I said I did. I married Nerine in 1997, against the advice of many and my own good sense. But I thought she would give up alcohol for me. We had a celebration in Pasadena, and Leonard was my best man. I woke up about eight o'clock the next morning and Nerine was drunk. She was in rehab for 30 days three different times. Twice she almost drank herself to death. Leonard took Nerine to Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, but she did not want to quit.}}\n\nIn 2000, a [[Reuters]] story reported that Shatner was planning to write and direct ''The Shiva Club'', a dark comedy about the grieving process inspired by his wife's death.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Shatner takes inspiration from tragedy |work=[[The Seattle Times]] |date=July 4, 2000 |agency=[[Reuters]] |page=E2}}</ref> Shatner's 2004 album ''Has Been'' included a spoken-word piece titled \"What Have You Done\" that describes his anguish upon discovering his wife's body in the pool.\n\nIn 2001, Shatner married Elizabeth Anderson Martin.

After ''Star Trek''{{'s}} cancellation in 1969, Shatner and Nimoy reunited in the production of ''[[Star Trek: The Animated Series]]'', as well as ''The $20,000 Pyramid'', where \"Kirk vs. Spock\" appeared on two different tables. Nimoy also guest-starred on ''T. J. Hooker'', a show in which Shatner played the title role.\n\nShatner's bereavement following the 1999 death of his third wife, Nerine, served to strengthen his friendship with Nimoy. Nimoy also appeared alongside Shatner at the [[TV Land Award]]s (hosted by [[John Ritter]]). Nimoy summarized his four-decade friendship with Shatner by remarking, \"Bill's energy was good for my performance, 'cause Spock could be the cool individual, our chemistry was successful, right from the start.\"\n\nNimoy spoke about their mutual rivalry during the ''Star Trek'' years:{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\n{{quote|Very competitive, sibling rivalry up to here. After the show had been on the air a few weeks and they started getting so much mail for Spock, then the dictum came down from NBC: \"Give us more of that guy, they love that guy, you know?\" Well, that can be ... that can be a problem for the leading man who was hired as the star of the show; and suddenly, here's this guy with ears \u2013 \"What's this, you know?\"|Leonard Nimoy}}\n\nOn an episode of the [[A&E (TV channel)|A&E]] series ''[[Biography (TV series)|Biography]]'', where it was also divulged that Nimoy was Shatner's best man at his wedding with his fourth wife Elisabeth, Nimoy remarked, \"Bill Shatner hogging the stage? No. Not the Bill Shatner I know.\" When Nimoy died in 2015, Shatner stated \"I loved him like a brother. We will all miss his humor, his talent, and his capacity to love.\" Although Shatner was unable to attend Nimoy's funeral due to other commitments, his daughters attended in his place, and Shatner created his own online memorial for Nimoy.\n\nShatner has been a friend of actress [[Heather Locklear]] since 1982, when she began co-starring with him on ''T. J. Hooker''. As she was also appearing in a semi-regular role in another [[Aaron Spelling]] production, ''[[Dynasty (1981 TV series)|Dynasty]]'', Locklear was asked by ''[[Entertainment Tonight]]'' whether this schedule was difficult. She replied \"I'd get really nervous and want to be prepared\" for Shatner and for the experienced cast of ''Dynasty''. After ''T.J. Hooker'' ended, Shatner helped Locklear get other roles. Locklear supported a grieving Shatner in 1999 when he was mourning the death of his wife Nerine. In 2005, Locklear appeared in two episodes of Shatner's ''Boston Legal'' as Kelly Nolan, a woman being tried for killing her much older, wealthy husband. Shatner's character is attracted to Nolan and tries to insert himself into her defense.{{Clarify|date=November 2014}} Locklear was asked how she came to appear on ''Boston Legal''. She explained \"I love the show, it's my favorite show; and I sorta kind of said, 'Shouldn't I be William Shatner's illegitimate daughter, or his love interest?'\"\n\n{{quote box|align=left|width=30%|quote=I was a lot more worried about working with Walter Koenig and Jimmy Doohan, two men who have made it clear on any number of occasions that my name is generally near the top of their shit lists.|salign=right|source=\u2014Shatner, on having to work again with two of his ''Star Trek'' co-stars in the 1994 movie, ''Star Trek Generations''<ref>Shatner, William (1994).

However, an [[Associated Press]] article published at the time of Doohan's final convention appearance in late August 2004 stated that Doohan, already suffering from severe health problems, had forgiven Shatner and they had mended their relationship. At a convention directly preceding Doohan's last one, Sky Conway, the convention's head, stated, \"At our show: 'The Great Bird of the Galaxy' in El Paso Texas in November 2003, a celebration of Gene Roddenberry and ''Star Trek'', Bill and Jimmy went on stage together.

Shatner was not as successful as the others, but during the 1960s he \"became a working actor who showed up on time, knew his lines, worked cheap and always answered his phone.\" His motto was \"Work equals work\", however, Shatner's willingness to take any role, no matter how \"forgettable\", likely hurt his career.{{r|jordan20100903}} He took the lead role in [[Roger Corman]]'s movie ''[[The Intruder (1962 film)|The Intruder]]'' (1962) and received very good reviews for his significant role in the [[Stanley Kramer]] film ''[[Judgment at Nuremberg]]'' (1961).

With very little money and few acting prospects, Shatner lost his home and lived in a truck-bed camper in the [[San Fernando Valley]] until small roles turned into higher-paying jobs. Shatner refers to this part of his life as \"that period\", a humbling time during which he would take any odd job, including small party appearances, to support his family.\n\nShatner again appeared in \"[[:wikt:schlock|schlock]]\" films, such as Corman's ''[[Big Bad Mama]]'' (1974) and the horror film ''[[The Devil's Rain (film)|The Devil's Rain]]'' (1975),{{r|jordan20100903}} ''[[Kingdom of the Spiders]]'' (1977), and the TV movie ''[[The Horror at 37,000 Feet]]''.

In a notable 1977 appearance, he gave an illegal clue (\"the ''blessed''\" for ''Things That Are Blessed'' when he had intended to say \"the [[Virgin Mary]]\") at the top of the pyramid ($200), which deprived the contestant of a big money win.

Shatner and the other original ''Star Trek'' cast members returned to their roles when Paramount produced ''[[Star Trek: The Motion Picture]]'', released in 1979. He played Kirk in the next six ''Star Trek'' films, ending with the character's death in ''[[Star Trek Generations]]'' (1994). Some later appearances in the role are in the movie sequences of the video game ''[[Star Trek: Starfleet Academy (video game)|Starfleet Academy]]'' (1997), briefly for a [[Lap giraffe|DirecTV advertisement]] using footage from ''Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country'' running from late summer 2006, and the [[85th Academy Awards|2013 Academy Awards]], in which he reprised the role for a comedic interlude with host [[Seth MacFarlane]].\n\nAlthough Trekkies resurrected ''Star Trek'' after cancellation, in a 1986 ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' sketch about a ''Star Trek'' convention, Shatner advised a room full of fans to \"get a life\".<ref name=\"jenkins1992\">{{cite book |last=Jenkins |first=Henry |authorlink=Henry Jenkins |year=1992 |title=Textual Poachers: Television Fans & Participatory Culture |url=https://books.google.com/?id=71U9-cOx_ZwC&lpg=PP1&dq=trekkie%20trekker&pg=PA9#v=onepage&q=jindra&f=false |location=New York |publisher=[[Routledge]] |pages=9\u201313 | isbn=978-0-415-90572-5 |oclc=26055104 |lccn=92019400 |accessdate=2013-11-12}}</ref>{{r|jordan20100903}} The much-discussed sketch accurately portrayed his feelings about Trekkies, which the actor had previously discussed in interviews.{{r|jenkins1992}} Shatner had been their unwilling subject of adoration for years; as early as April 1968, a group attempted to rip his clothes off as the actor left [[GE Building|30 Rockefeller Plaza]],<ref name=\"lowry19680329\">{{cite news |last=Lowry |first=Cynthia |date=March 29, 1968 |title=TV Fans Save Space Ship Enterprise From Mothballs |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=kSgsAAAAIBAJ&sjid=jMYEAAAAIBAJ&pg=821,4386600 |newspaper=[[TimesDaily|Florence Times\u2014Tri-Cities Daily]] |location=Florence, AL |publisher=Tri-Cities Newspapers, Inc. |agency=Associated Press |page=15 |accessdate=2013-11-12}}</ref> and he stopped attending conventions for more than a decade during the 1970s and 1980s.<ref name=\"martin19860907\">{{cite news | title=Star Trek: Five-Year Mission Turns Into 20 | work=San Francisco Chronicle | date=September 7, 1986 | author=Martin, Sue | page=49}}</ref> Shatner also appeared in the film ''[[Free Enterprise (film)|Free Enterprise]]'' in 1998, in which he played himself and tried to dispel the Kirk image of himself from the view of the film's two lead characters. He also has found an outlet in spoofing the cavalier, almost superhuman, persona of Captain Kirk in films such as ''[[Airplane II: The Sequel]]'' (1982) and ''[[National Lampoon, Incorporated|National Lampoon's]] [[Loaded Weapon 1]]'' (1993). In 1994, he starred as the murderer in the ''[[Columbo]]'' episode \"[[List of Columbo episodes#Season 10 and specials|Butterfly in Shades of Grey]]\".\n\nBesides the ''Star Trek'' films, Shatner landed a starring role on television as the titular police officer ''[[T.

He narrated a television miniseries shot in New Zealand ''[[A Twist in the Tale (1998 TV series)|A Twist in the Tale]]'' (1998). In the television series ''[[3rd Rock from the Sun]]'', Shatner appeared in several 1999\u20132000 episodes as the \"[[Big Giant Head]]\", a high-ranking officer from the same alien planet as the Solomon family who becomes a womanizing party-animal on Earth.

The LAPD ruled out foul play, and the case was closed.\n\nSpeaking to the press shortly after his wife's death, a clearly shaken and emotional Shatner said that she \"meant everything\" to him, and called her his \"beautiful soulmate\".<ref name=\"quirk\">{{cite journal |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=William Shatner: Captain Quirk |url=http://bulletin.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=149333 |journal=[[The Bulletin (Australian periodical)|The Bulletin]] |date=October 3, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061027171515/http://bulletin.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=149333 |archivedate=October 27, 2006 |accessdate=2013-11-12}}</ref> Shatner urged the public to support Friendly House, a nonprofit organization that helps women re-establish themselves in the community after suffering from alcoholism and drug addiction.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scifi.com/sfw/issue124/news.html|title=Science Fiction News of the Week |website=Science Fiction Weekly |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325130127/http://www.scifi.com/sfw/issue124/news.html |archivedate=March 25, 2009 |accessdate=2012-03-07}}</ref> He later told [[Larry King]] in an interview that \"my wife, whom I loved dearly, and who loved me, was suffering with a disease that we don't like to talk about: alcoholism. And she met a tragic ending because of it.\"<ref name=\"quirk\" />\n\nIn his 2008 book ''Up Till Now: The Autobiography'', Shatner discusses how Leonard Nimoy helped take Nerine to treatment for her alcoholism. Shatner writes in an excerpt from his book:\n\n{{quote|Leonard Nimoy's personal experience of alcoholism now came to play a central role in my life and it helped us bond together in a way I never could have imagined in the early days of ''Star Trek''. After Nerine [Kidd] and I had been to dinner with Leonard and Susan Nimoy one evening, Leonard called and said: \"Bill, you know she's an alcoholic?\" I said I did. I married Nerine in 1997, against the advice of many and my own good sense. But I thought she would give up alcohol for me. We had a celebration in Pasadena, and Leonard was my best man. I woke up about eight o'clock the next morning and Nerine was drunk. She was in rehab for 30 days three different times. Twice she almost drank herself to death. Leonard took Nerine to Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, but she did not want to quit.}}\n\nIn 2000, a [[Reuters]] story reported that Shatner was planning to write and direct ''The Shiva Club'', a dark comedy about the grieving process inspired by his wife's death.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Shatner takes inspiration from tragedy |work=[[The Seattle Times]] |date=July 4, 2000 |agency=[[Reuters]] |page=E2}}</ref> Shatner's 2004 album ''Has Been'' included a spoken-word piece titled \"What Have You Done\" that describes his anguish upon discovering his wife's body in the pool.\n\nIn 2001, Shatner married Elizabeth Anderson Martin.

After ''Star Trek''{{'s}} cancellation in 1969, Shatner and Nimoy reunited in the production of ''[[Star Trek: The Animated Series]]'', as well as ''The $20,000 Pyramid'', where \"Kirk vs. Spock\" appeared on two different tables. Nimoy also guest-starred on ''T. J. Hooker'', a show in which Shatner played the title role.\n\nShatner's bereavement following the 1999 death of his third wife, Nerine, served to strengthen his friendship with Nimoy. Nimoy also appeared alongside Shatner at the [[TV Land Award]]s (hosted by [[John Ritter]]). Nimoy summarized his four-decade friendship with Shatner by remarking, \"Bill's energy was good for my performance, 'cause Spock could be the cool individual, our chemistry was successful, right from the start.\"\n\nNimoy spoke about their mutual rivalry during the ''Star Trek'' years:{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\n{{quote|Very competitive, sibling rivalry up to here. After the show had been on the air a few weeks and they started getting so much mail for Spock, then the dictum came down from NBC: \"Give us more of that guy, they love that guy, you know?\" Well, that can be ... that can be a problem for the leading man who was hired as the star of the show; and suddenly, here's this guy with ears \u2013 \"What's this, you know?\"|Leonard Nimoy}}\n\nOn an episode of the [[A&E (TV channel)|A&E]] series ''[[Biography (TV series)|Biography]]'', where it was also divulged that Nimoy was Shatner's best man at his wedding with his fourth wife Elisabeth, Nimoy remarked, \"Bill Shatner hogging the stage? No. Not the Bill Shatner I know.\" When Nimoy died in 2015, Shatner stated \"I loved him like a brother. We will all miss his humor, his talent, and his capacity to love.\" Although Shatner was unable to attend Nimoy's funeral due to other commitments, his daughters attended in his place, and Shatner created his own online memorial for Nimoy.\n\nShatner has been a friend of actress [[Heather Locklear]] since 1982, when she began co-starring with him on ''T. J. Hooker''. As she was also appearing in a semi-regular role in another [[Aaron Spelling]] production, ''[[Dynasty (1981 TV series)|Dynasty]]'', Locklear was asked by ''[[Entertainment Tonight]]'' whether this schedule was difficult. She replied \"I'd get really nervous and want to be prepared\" for Shatner and for the experienced cast of ''Dynasty''. After ''T.J. Hooker'' ended, Shatner helped Locklear get other roles. Locklear supported a grieving Shatner in 1999 when he was mourning the death of his wife Nerine. In 2005, Locklear appeared in two episodes of Shatner's ''Boston Legal'' as Kelly Nolan, a woman being tried for killing her much older, wealthy husband. Shatner's character is attracted to Nolan and tries to insert himself into her defense.{{Clarify|date=November 2014}} Locklear was asked how she came to appear on ''Boston Legal''. She explained \"I love the show, it's my favorite show; and I sorta kind of said, 'Shouldn't I be William Shatner's illegitimate daughter, or his love interest?'\"\n\n{{quote box|align=left|width=30%|quote=I was a lot more worried about working with Walter Koenig and Jimmy Doohan, two men who have made it clear on any number of occasions that my name is generally near the top of their shit lists.|salign=right|source=\u2014Shatner, on having to work again with two of his ''Star Trek'' co-stars in the 1994 movie, ''Star Trek Generations''<ref>Shatner, William (1994).

However, an [[Associated Press]] article published at the time of Doohan's final convention appearance in late August 2004 stated that Doohan, already suffering from severe health problems, had forgiven Shatner and they had mended their relationship. At a convention directly preceding Doohan's last one, Sky Conway, the convention's head, stated, \"At our show: 'The Great Bird of the Galaxy' in El Paso Texas in November 2003, a celebration of Gene Roddenberry and ''Star Trek'', Bill and Jimmy went on stage together.

He was spotted one night by John Gibb of Brian Howard & the Silhouettes, who asked him to help record some singles for [[Columbia Graphophone Company]], including \"The Worrying Kind\". [[Mike Leander]] of [[Decca Records]] first offered Page regular studio work. His first session for the label was the recording \"[[Diamonds (Jerry Lordan song)|Diamonds]]\" by [[Jet Harris]] and [[Tony Meehan]], which went to Number 1 on the singles chart in early 1963.<ref name=\"Schulps\" />\n\nAfter brief stints with [[Carter-Lewis and the Southerners]], [[Mike Hurst (producer)|Mike Hurst]] and the Method and [[Mickey Finn (guitarist)|Mickey Finn and the Blue Men]], Page committed himself to full-time session work. As a session guitarist, he was known as 'Lil' Jim Pea' to prevent confusion with the other noted English session guitarist [[Big Jim Sullivan]]. Page was mainly called into sessions as \"insurance\" in instances when a replacement or second guitarist was required by the recording artist. \"It was usually myself and a drummer\", he explained, \"though they never mention the drummer these days, just me&nbsp;... Anyone needing a guitarist either went to Big Jim [Sullivan] or myself.\"<ref name=\"Schulps\" /> He stated that \"In the initial stages they just said, play what you want, cos at that time I couldn't read music or anything.\"<ref name=DuNoyer>{{cite journal|last=Paul|first=Du Noyer|title=Who the hell does Jimmy Page think he is?|work=[[Q (magazine)|Q]] magazine|issue=August 1988|pages=5\u20137}}</ref>\n\n{{listen|type=music\n| filename = Jimmy Page - She Just Satisfies.ogg\n| title = She Just Satisfies\n| description = Sample of \"She Just Satisfies\", Page's first single (released in 1965).<ref>{{cite book|author=George Case|title=Jimmy Page: Magus, Musician, Man: An Unauthorized Biography|date=1 April 2009|publisher=Backbeat Books|url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=N3o3AQAAIAAJ}} |isbn=978-0-87930-947-3 |page=43}}</ref>\n| pos = right\n}}\n\nPage was the favoured session guitarist of record producer [[Shel Talmy]].

He composed and recorded songs for the John Williams (not to be confused with the film composer [[John Williams]]) album ''The Maureeny Wishful Album'' with Big Jim Sullivan. Page worked as session musician on [[Donovan]] Leitch's ''[[Sunshine Superman (album)|Sunshine Superman]]'' and the [[Johnny Hallyday]] albums ''Jeune Homme'' and ''Je Suis N\u00e9 Dans La Rue'', the [[Al Stewart]] album ''[[Love Chronicles]]'' and played guitar on five tracks of [[Joe Cocker]]'s debut album, ''[[With a Little Help from My Friends (Joe Cocker album)|With a Little Help from My Friends]]''. Over the years since 1970, Page played lead guitar on 10 [[Roy Harper (singer)|Roy Harper]] tracks, comprising 81 minutes of music.\n\nWhen questioned about which songs he played on, especially ones where there exists some controversy as to what his exact role was, Page often points out that it is hard to remember exactly what he did given the enormous number of sessions he was playing at the time.<ref name=\"DuNoyer\"/><ref name=\"tripleJ\" /> In a radio interview he explained that \"I was doing three sessions a day, fifteen sessions a week. Sometimes I would be playing with a group, sometimes I could be doing film music, it could be a folk session&nbsp;... I was able to fit all these different roles.\"<ref name=\"NPRPage\"/>\n\nAlthough Page recorded with many notable musicians, many of these early tracks are only available as [[bootleg recording]]s, several of which were released by the Led Zeppelin fan club in the late 1970s. One of the rarest of these is the early jam session featuring him and Stones guitarist [[Keith Richards]] covering [[Robert Johnson]]'s \"Little Queen of Spades\". Several early tracks were compiled on the twin album release, ''[[Jimmy Page: Session Man]]''. He also recorded with Richards on guitar and vocals in [[Olympic Sound Studios]] on 15 October 1974. Along with [[Ric Grech]] on bass and [[Bruce Rowland]] on drums, a track called \"Scarlet\" was cut. Page reflected later in an interview with ''Rolling Stone''{{'}}s [[Cameron Crowe]]: \"I did what could possibly be the next Stones B side. It was Ric Grech, Keith and me doing a number called \"Scarlet.\" I can't remember the drummer. It sounded very similar in style and mood to those ''Blonde on Blonde'' tracks. It was great, really good. We stayed up all night and went down to Island Studios where Keith put some reggae guitars over one section. I just put some solos on it, but it was eight in the morning of the next day before I did that. He took the tapes to Switzerland and someone found out about them. Keith told people that it was a track from my album\".<ref name=\"PP75\" />\n\nPage left studio work when the increasing influence of [[Stax Records]] on popular music led to the greater incorporation of brass and orchestral arrangements into recordings at the expense of guitars.<ref name=\"JPinterview\" /> He stated that his time as a session player served as extremely good schooling:\n{{quote|My session work was invaluable. At one point I was playing at least three sessions a day, six days a week! And I rarely ever knew in advance what I was going to be playing. But I learned things even on my worst sessions \u2013 and believe me, I played on some horrendous things. I finally called it quits after I started getting calls to do [[Elevator music|Muzak]]. I decided I couldn't live that life any more; it was getting too silly. I guess it was destiny that a week after I quit doing sessions Paul Samwell-Smith left the Yardbirds and I was able to take his place.

The experience gave Page an idea to form a new [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] featuring Beck, along with [[The Who]]'s [[John Entwistle]] on bass and Moon on drums.<ref name=\"Schulps\" /> However, the lack of a quality vocalist and contractual problems prevented the project from getting off the ground. During this time, Moon suggested the name \"Lead [[Zeppelin]]\" for the first time, after Entwistle commented that the proceedings would take to the air like a lead balloon.\n\nWithin weeks, Page attended a Yardbirds concert at [[Oxford]]. After the show, he went backstage where [[Paul Samwell-Smith]] announced that he was leaving the group.<ref name=\"JPinterview\" /> Page offered to replace Samwell-Smith, and this was accepted by the group. He initially played electric bass with the Yardbirds before finally switching to twin lead guitar with Beck when [[Chris Dreja]] moved to bass. The musical potential of the line-up was scuttled, however, by interpersonal conflicts caused by constant touring and a lack of commercial success, although they released one single, \"[[Happenings Ten Years Time Ago]]\". While Page and Beck played together in the Yardbirds, the trio of Page, Beck and Clapton never played in the original group at the same time. The three guitarists did appear on stage together at the [[ARMS Charity Concert]]s in 1983.\n\nAfter Beck's departure, the Yardbirds remained a quartet. They recorded one album with Page on lead guitar, ''[[Little Games]]''. The album received indifferent reviews and was not a commercial success, peaking at number 80 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. Though their studio sound was fairly commercial at the time, the band's live performances were just the opposite, becoming heavier and more experimental. These concerts featured musical aspects that Page would later perfect with Led Zeppelin, most notably performances of \"[[Dazed and Confused (song)#Led Zeppelin live performances|Dazed and Confused]]\".\n\nAfter the departure of [[Keith Relf]] and [[Jim McCarty]] in 1968, Page reconfigured the group with a new line-up to fulfil unfinished tour dates in Scandinavia. To this end, Page recruited vocalist [[Robert Plant]] and drummer [[John Bonham]], and he was also contacted by [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]], who asked to join.<ref name=\"Miserandino\">{{cite web|url=http://thecelebritycafe.com/interviews/john_paul_jones.html|title=Led Zeppelin : John talks about his musical career with Led Zeppelin, before and after|first=Dominick A.|last=Miserandino|work=TheCelebrityCafe.com|date=29 November 2000|accessdate=18 February 2015}}</ref> During the [[Led Zeppelin Scandinavian Tour 1968|Scandinavian tour]], the new group appeared as the New Yardbirds, but soon recalled the old joke by Keith Moon and John Entwistle.

Various sources estimate the group's worldwide sales at more than 200 or even 300 million albums. With 111.5 million RIAA-certified units, they are the second-best-selling band in the United States. Each of their nine studio albums reached the top 10 of the US Billboard album chart, and six reached the number-one spot.\n\nLed Zeppelin were the progenitors of heavy metal and hard rock, and their sound was largely the product of Page's input as a producer and musician. The band's individualistic style drew from a wide variety of influences. They performed on multiple record-breaking concert tours, which also earned them a reputation for excess. Although they remained commercially and critically successful, in the later 1970s, the band's output and touring schedule were limited by the personal difficulties of the members.\n\nPage explained that he had a very specific idea in mind as to what he wanted Led Zeppelin to be, from the very beginning:\n{{quote|I had a lot of ideas from my days with the Yardbirds. The Yardbirds allowed me to improvise a lot in live performance and I started building a textbook of ideas that I eventually used in Zeppelin. In addition to those ideas, I wanted to add acoustic textures. Ultimately, I wanted Zeppelin to be a marriage of blues, hard rock and acoustic music topped with heavy choruses \u2013 a combination that had never been done before. Lots of light and shade in the music.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />}}\n\n=== Post-Led Zeppelin career ===\nLed Zeppelin broke up in 1980 following the death of Bonham at Page's home. Page initially refused to touch a guitar, grieving for his friend.<ref name=\"DuNoyer\"/><ref name=\"uncutinterview\">{{cite web|url=http://www.uncut.co.uk/features/john-paul-jones-on-jimmy-page-37701|first=David|last=Cavanagh|title=John Paul Jones on Jimmy Page|work=[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]]|date=29 December 2008|accessdate=18 February 2015}}</ref> For the rest of the 1980s, his work consisted of a series of short-term collaborations in the bands [[The Firm (rock band)|the Firm]], [[the Honeydrippers]], reunions and individual work, including film soundtracks. He also became active in philanthropic work.\n\n===1980s===\n[[File:Jimmy Page 1983.jpg|thumb|upright|Page in 1983]]\n\nPage made a return to the stage at a Jeff Beck show in March 1981 at the [[Hammersmith Odeon]].{{sfn|Case|2007|p=164}} Also in 1981, Page joined with [[Yes (band)|Yes]] bassist [[Chris Squire]] and drummer [[Alan White (Yes drummer)|Alan White]] to form a supergroup called [[XYZ (UK band)|XYZ]] (for former Yes-Zeppelin). They rehearsed several times, but the project was shelved. Bootlegs of these sessions revealed that some of the material emerged on later projects, notably The Firm's \"Fortune Hunter\" and Yes songs \"Mind Drive\" and \"Can You Imagine?\". Page joined Yes on stage in 1984 at [[Westfalenhalle]] in [[Dortmund]], Germany, playing \"[[I'm Down]]\".\n\nIn 1982, Page collaborated with director [[Michael Winner]] to record the ''[[Death Wish II (album)|Death Wish II]]'' soundtrack. This and several subsequent Page recordings, including the ''[[Death Wish III]]'' soundtrack, were recorded and produced at his recording studio, [[Sol Studios|The Sol]] in [[Cookham]], which he had purchased from [[Gus Dudgeon]] in the early 1980s.\n\n[[File:Jimmy Page - A.R.M.S. Concert, Oakland, Ca. 1983.jpg|thumb|left|Page at an A.R.M.S. concert in 1983]]\n\nIn 1983, Page appeared with the A.R.M.S. (Action Research for [[Multiple Sclerosis]]) charity series of concerts which honoured [[Small Faces]] bassist [[Ronnie Lane]], who suffered from the disease. For the first shows at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] in London, Page's set consisted of songs from the ''Death Wish II'' soundtrack (with [[Steve Winwood]] on vocals) and an instrumental version of \"Stairway to Heaven\". A four-city tour of the United States followed, with [[Paul Rodgers]] of [[Bad Company]] replacing Winwood. During the tour, Page and Rodgers performed \"Midnight Moonlight\", which would later appear on The Firm's first album. All of the shows featured an on stage jam of \"[[Layla]]\" that reunited Page with Beck and Clapton. According to the book ''[[Hammer of the Gods (book)|Hammer of the Gods]]'', it was reportedly around this time that Page told friends that he had just ended seven years of heroin use. On 13 December 1983, Page joined Plant on stage for one encore at the Hammersmith Odeon in London.\n\nPage next linked up with [[Roy Harper (singer)|Roy Harper]] for the 1984 album ''[[Whatever Happened to Jugula?]]'' and occasional concerts, performing a predominantly acoustic set at folk festivals under various guises such as the MacGregors and Themselves. Also in 1984, Page recorded with Plant as the Honeydrippers the album ''[[The Honeydrippers: Volume 1]]'' and with [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]] on the film soundtrack ''[[Scream for Help (album)|Scream for Help]]''.\n\nPage subsequently collaborated with Rodgers on two albums under the name [[The Firm (rock band)|The Firm]]. The first album, released in 1985, was the self-titled ''[[The Firm (album)|The Firm]]''. Popular songs included \"[[Radioactive (The Firm song)|Radioactive]]\" and \"Satisfaction Guaranteed\". The album peaked at number 17 on the ''Billboard'' pop albums chart and went gold in the US. It was followed by ''[[Mean Business]]'' in 1986. The band toured in support of both albums, but soon split up.\n\nVarious other projects followed, such as session work for [[Graham Nash]], [[Stephen Stills]] and the Rolling Stones (on their 1986 single \"[[One Hit (to the Body)]]\"). In 1986, Page reunited temporarily with his former Yardbirds bandmates to play on several tracks of the [[Box of Frogs]] album ''Strange Land''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3534576.stm|title=Zeppelin defend Live Aid opt out|work=BBC News|date=4 August 2004|accessdate=11 September 2010}}</ref> Page released a solo album entitled ''[[Outrider (album)|Outrider]]'' in 1988, which featured contributions from Plant, with Page contributing in turn to Plant's solo album ''[[Now and Zen]]'', which was released the same year.

However, the band members considered this performance to be sub-standard, with Page having been let down by a poorly tuned Les Paul. Page, Plant and Jones, as well as John Bonham's son [[Jason Bonham|Jason]], performed at the [[Atlantic Records 40th Anniversary]] show on 14 May 1988, closing the 12-hour show.{{sfn|Lewis|Pallett|2005|p=139}}\n\n===1990s===\nIn 1990, a [[Concerts at Knebworth House|Knebworth]] concert to aid the Nordoff-Robbins Music Therapy Centre and the British School for Performing Arts and Technology saw Plant unexpectedly joined by Page to perform \"[[Misty Mountain Hop]]\", \"[[Wearing and Tearing]]\" and \"[[Rock and Roll (Led Zeppelin song)|Rock and Roll]]\". The same year, Page appeared with [[Aerosmith]] at the [[Monsters of Rock]] festival. Page also performed with the band's former members at Jason Bonham's wedding. Page also embarked on a collaboration with [[David Coverdale]] in 1993 entitled [[Coverdale Page]].\n\nIn 1994, Page reunited with Plant for the penultimate performance in MTV's \"[[MTV Unplugged|Unplugged]]\" series. The 90-minute special, dubbed ''Unledded'', premiered to the highest ratings in MTV's history. In October of the same year, the session was released as the CD ''[[No Quarter: Jimmy Page and Robert Plant Unledded]]'' and in 2004 as the DVD ''[[No Quarter Unledded]]''. Following a highly successful mid-1990s tour to support ''No Quarter'', Page and Plant recorded 1998's ''[[Walking into Clarksdale]]'', along with drummer [[Michael Lee (musician)|Michael Lee]].\n\nPage was heavily involved in [[remaster]]ing the Led Zeppelin catalogue. He participated in various charity concerts and charity work, particularly the ''Action for Brazil's Children Trust'' (ABC Trust), founded by his wife Jimena Gomez-Paratcha in 1998. In the same year, Page played guitar for [[Hip hop music|rap]] singer/producer [[Puff Daddy]]'s song \"[[Come with Me (Puff Daddy & Jimmy Page song)|Come with Me]]\", which heavily samples Led Zeppelin's \"[[Kashmir (song)|Kashmir]]\" and was included in the soundtrack of ''[[Godzilla (1998 film)|Godzilla]]''. The two later performed the song on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''.\n\nIn October 1999, Page teamed up with [[The Black Crowes]] for a two-night performance of material from the Led Zeppelin catalogue and old blues and rock standards. The concert was recorded and released as a [[double album|double live album]], ''[[Live at the Greek]]'' in 2000. In 2001, he made an appearance on stage with [[Limp Bizkit]] frontman [[Fred Durst]] and [[Wes Scantlin]] of [[Puddle of Mudd]] at the MTV Europe Video Music Awards in [[Frankfurt]], where they performed a version of Led Zeppelin's \"[[Thank You (Led Zeppelin song)|Thank You]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://music.yahoo.com/read/news/12051457|title=Led Zep's Page Joins Limp Bizkit's Durst And Puddle of Mudd's Scantlin On Stage|accessdate=17 February 2007|date=11 October 2001|publisher=Yahoo|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070616141509/http://music.yahoo.com/read/news/12051457|archivedate=16 June 2007}}</ref>\n\n===2000s===\n[[File:JimmyPage.jpg|thumb|upright|Jimmy Page performing at the Led Zeppelin reunion concert at [[the O2 Arena]] in London in 2007]]\n\nIn 2005, Page was appointed [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] (OBE) in recognition of his Brazilian charity work for Task Brazil and Action For Brazil's Children's Trust,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/arts/story/2005/12/14/page-obe.html|title=Jimmy Page given OBE for charity work|accessdate=6 January 2007|date=14 December 2005|work=CBC.ca Arts|publisher=CBC|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312030202/http://www.cbc.ca/arts/story/2005/12/14/page-obe.html|archivedate=12 March 2007}}</ref> made an honorary citizen of [[Rio de Janeiro]] later that year and was awarded a Grammy Award.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4271212.stm|title=Zeppelin's Page made Rio citizen|accessdate=6 January 2007|date=22 September 2006|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC}}</ref>\n\nIn November 2006, Led Zeppelin was inducted into the [[UK Music Hall of Fame]].

The Jimmy Page Signature [[EDS-1275]] has been produced by Gibson. Recently, Gibson reproduced Page's 1960 Les Paul Black Beauty, the one stolen from him in 1970, with modern modifications. This guitar was sold in 2008 with a run of 25, again signed by Page, plus an additional 500 unsigned guitars.\n\nIn December 2009, Gibson released the 'Jimmy Page \"Number Two\" Les Paul'.<ref name=\"GIBJPNo2\">{{cite web|title=9.6 Rating Jimmy Page \"Number Two\" Les Paul|url=http://www2.gibson.com/Products/Electric-Guitars/Les-Paul/Gibson-Custom/Jimmy-Page-Number-Two-Les-Paul.aspx|publisher=Gibson|accessdate=4 July 2011}}</ref> This is a re-creation of Page's famous \"Number Two\" Les Paul used by him since about 1974.

I started to learn microphone placements and things like that, what did and what didn't work. I certainly knew what did and didn't work with drummers because they put drummers in these little sound booths that had no sound deflection at all and the drums would just sound awful. The reality of it is the drum is a musical instrument, it relies on having a bright room and a live room&nbsp;... And so bit by bit I was learning really how ''not'' to record.<ref name=\"NPRPage\"/></blockquote>\n\nHe developed a reputation for employing effects in new ways and trying out different methods of using microphones and amplification. During the late 1960s, most British music producers placed [[microphone]]s directly in front of [[amplifier]]s and drums, resulting in the sometimes \"tinny\" sound of the recordings of the era. Page commented to ''Guitar World'' magazine that he felt the drum sounds of the day in particular \"sounded like cardboard boxes.\"<ref name=\"guiwo\" /> Instead, Page was a fan of 1950s recording techniques, [[Sun Studio]] being a particular favourite. In the same ''Guitar World'' interview, Page remarked: \"Recording used to be a science\" and \"[engineers] used to have a maxim: distance equals depth.\" Taking this maxim to heart, Page developed the idea of placing an additional microphone some distance from the amplifier (as much as twenty feet) and then recording the balance between the two. By adopting this technique, Page became one of the first British producers to record a band's \"ambient sound\" \u2013 the distance of a note's time-lag from one end of the room to the other.<ref name=\"RS2006\"/>\n\nFor the recording of several Led Zeppelin tracks, such as \"[[Whole Lotta Love]]\" and \"[[You Shook Me]]\", Page additionally utilised \"[[reverse echo]]\" \u2013 a technique which he claims to have invented himself while with the Yardbirds (he had originally developed the method when recording the 1967 single \"[[Ten Little Indians (Harry Nilsson song)|Ten Little Indians]]\").<ref name=\"guiwo\"/> This production technique involved hearing the echo before the main sound instead of after it, achieved by turning the tape over and employing the echo on a spare track, then turning the tape back over again to get the echo preceding the signal.\n\nPage has stated that, as producer, he deliberately changed the [[audio engineer]]s on Led Zeppelin albums, from [[Glyn Johns]] for the first album, to [[Eddie Kramer]] for ''[[Led Zeppelin II]]'', to [[Andy Johns]] for ''[[Led Zeppelin III]]'' and later albums. He explained: \"I consciously kept changing engineers because I didn't want people to think that they were responsible for our sound. I wanted people to know it was me.\"<ref name=\"guiwo\" />\n\nJohn Paul Jones acknowledged that Page's production techniques were a key component of the success of Led Zeppelin:\n\n{{quote|The backwards echo stuff [and] a lot of the microphone techniques were just inspired. Using distance-miking&nbsp;... and small amplifiers. Everybody thinks we go in the studio with huge walls of amplifiers, but Page doesn't. He uses a really small amplifier and he just mikes it up really well, so that it fits into a sonic picture.<ref name=\"uncutinterview\"/>}}\n\nIn an interview that Page himself gave to ''Guitar World'' magazine in 1993, he remarked on his work as a producer:\n\n{{quote|Many people think of me as just a riff guitarist, but I think of myself in broader terms&nbsp;... As a record producer I would like to be remembered as someone who was able to sustain a band of unquestionable individual talent and push it to the forefront during its working career. I think I really captured the best of our output, growth, change and maturity on tape \u2013 the multifaceted gem that is Led Zeppelin.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />}}\n\n==Personal life==\n===Partners===\nAn early 1960s companion was American recording artist [[Jackie DeShannon]], possibly the inspiration for the Page composition and Led Zeppelin recording \"Tangerine\".{{sfn|Lewis|2012|p=44}}\n\nFrench model Charlotte Martin was Page's partner from 1970 to about 1982 or 1983. Page called her \"My Lady\". Together they had a daughter, [[Scarlet Page]] (born in 1971), who is a photographer.\n\nAlso during the 1970s, Page had a well-documented, several-year-long relationship with \"baby groupie\" [[Lori Mattix]] (also known as Lori Maddox), beginning when she was 13 or 14 and while he was an adult in his twenties. In light of the [[Me Too movement]] four decades later, this attracted renewed attention as [[statutory rape]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/@msullivangates/a-word-on-david-bowie-lori-mattix-and-the-speed-of-information-b38681f24cf4|title=A Word on David Bowie, Lori Mattix, and the Speed of Information|publisher=Medium.com|accessdate=12 September 2018}}{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/the-10-wildest-led-zeppelin-legends-fact-checked-20121121/jimmy-page-dated-a-14-year-old-girl-while-he-was-in-led-zeppelin-19691231|title=Jimmy Page Dated a 14-year-old Girl While He Was in Led Zeppelin \u2013 The 10 Wildest Led Zeppelin Legends, Fact-Checked|website=Rolling Stone|access-date=30 March 2016}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1986 to 1995, Page was married to Patricia Ecker, a model and waitress.

In an interview with ''[[Guitar World]]'' magazine in 2003, he stated: \"I can't speak for the [other members of the band], but for me drugs were an integral part of the whole thing, right from the beginning, right to the end.\"<ref>Tolinski, Brad. \"The Greatest Show on Earth\", ''Guitar World'', July 2003; re-published in ''Guitar Legends Magazine'', Winter 2004, p. 72.</ref> After the band's 1973 [[Led Zeppelin North American Tour 1973|North American tour]], Page told [[Nick Kent]]: \"Oh, everyone went over the top a few times.

He later said that following this discovery, he thought: \"Yes, that's it. My thing: I've found it.\"{{sfn|Salewicz|2018|p=33}}\n\nThe appearance of four symbols on the jacket of Led Zeppelin's [[Led Zeppelin IV|fourth album]] has been linked to Page's interest in the occult.<ref name=\"GW2008\">''Jimmy Page interview'', ''Guitar World'', January 2008.</ref> The four symbols represented each member of the band. Page's own so-called \"Zoso\" symbol originated in ''Ars Magica Arteficii'' (1557) by [[Gerolamo Cardano]], an old alchemical [[grimoire]], where it has been identified as a [[sigil (magic)|sigil]] consisting of zodiac signs. The sigil is reproduced in ''Dictionary of Occult, Hermetic and Alchemical Sigils'' by Fred Gettings.{{sfn|Gettings|1981|p=201}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.inthelight.co.nz/ledzep/zososymbol.htm|title=Jimmy Page's symbol|date=17 September 2009|accessdate=4 December 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222124002/http://www.inthelight.co.nz/ledzep/zososymbol.htm|archivedate=22 February 2012}}\n</ref>\n\nDuring tours and performances after the release of the fourth album, Page often had the \"Zoso\" symbol embroidered on his clothes, along with [[zodiac]] symbols. These were visible most notably on his \"Dragon Suit\", which included the signs for Capricorn, Scorpio and Cancer which are Page's Sun, Ascendant and Moon signs, respectively.\n\nThe artwork inside the album cover of ''Led Zeppelin IV'' is from a painting attributed to the artist Barrington Colby, influenced by the traditional Rider/Waite Tarot card design for the card called \"The Hermit\". Very little is known about Colby and rumours have persisted down the years that Page himself is responsible for the painting.<ref name=\"GW2008\" /> Page transforms into this character during his fantasy sequence in Led Zeppelin's concert film ''The Song Remains the Same''.\n\nIn the early 1970s Page owned an occult bookshop and publishing house, The Equinox Booksellers and Publishers, at 4 [[Holland Street, Kensington|Holland Street]] in [[Kensington]], London, named after Crowley's biannual magazine, ''[[The Equinox]]''.{{sfn|Salewicz|2018|p=289}} The design of the interior incorporated Egyptian and Art Deco motifs, with Crowley's birth chart affixed to a wall. Page's reasons for setting up the bookshop were straightforward:\n<blockquote>There was not one bookshop in London with a good collection of occult books and I was so pissed off at not being able to get the books I wanted.{{sfn|Salewicz|2018|p=289}}</blockquote>\n\nThe company published two books: a facsimile of Crowley's 1904 edition of ''[[The Goetia]]''<ref name=\"Tolinski2012\">{{cite book|author=Brad Tolinski|title=Light and Shade: Conversations with Jimmy Page|year=2012|publisher=Virgin|url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=6gzUbV5AJQYC}}|isbn=978-0-7535-4039-8|page=183}}</ref> and ''Astrology, A Cosmic Science'' by Isabel Hickey.{{sfn|Salewicz|2018|p=290}} The lease eventually expired on the premises and was not renewed. As Page said: \"It obviously wasn't going to run the way it should without some drastic business changes, and I didn't really want to have to agree to all that. I basically just wanted the shop to be the nucleus, that's all.\"{{sfn|Salewicz|2018|p=410}}\n\nPage has maintained a strong interest in Crowley for many years. In 1978, he explained:\n\n{{quote|I feel Aleister Crowley is a misunderstood genius of the 20th century. It is because his whole thing was liberation of the person, of the entity and that restrictions would foul you up, lead to frustration which leads to violence, crime, mental breakdown, depending on what sort of makeup you have underneath. The further this age we're in now gets into technology and alienation, a lot of the points he's made seem to manifest themselves all down the line. ... I'm not saying it's a system for anybody to follow. I don't agree with everything but I find a lot of it relevant and it's those things that people attacked him on, so he was misunderstood. ... I'm not trying to interest anyone in Aleister Crowley any more than I am in Charles Dickens. All it was, was that at a particular time he was expounding a theory of self-liberation, which is something which is so important. He was like an eye to the world, into the forthcoming situation. My studies have been quite intensive, but I don't particularly want to go into it because it's a personal thing and isn't in relation to anything apart from the fact that I've employed his system in my own day to day life. ... The thing is to come to terms with one's free will, discover one's place and what one is, and from that you can go ahead and do it and not spend your whole life suppressed and frustrated. It's very basically coming to terms with yourself.<ref>''[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]'', 13&nbsp;March 1978.</ref>}}\n\nPage was commissioned to write the soundtrack music for the film ''[[Lucifer Rising (film)|Lucifer Rising]]'' by Crowley admirer and underground movie director [[Kenneth Anger]]. Page ultimately produced 23 minutes of music, which Anger felt was insufficient because the film ran for 28 minutes and Anger wanted the film to have a full soundtrack. Anger claimed Page took three years to deliver the music and the final product was only 23 minutes of \"droning\". The director also slammed the guitarist in the press by calling him a \"dabbler\" in the occult and an addict and being too strung out on drugs to complete the project. Page countered that he had fulfilled all his obligations, even going so far as to lend Anger his own film editing equipment to help him finish the project.<ref name=\"GW2006\">''The Story Behind The Lost Lucifer Rising Soundtrack'', ''[[Guitar World]]'', October 2006.</ref> Page released the Lucifer Rising music on vinyl in 2012 via his website on \"Lucifer Rising and other sound tracks\". Side one contained \"Lucifer Rising \u2013 Main Track\", whilst side two contained the tracks \"Incubus\", \"Damask\", \"Unharmonics\", \"Damask \u2013 Ambient\", and \"Lucifer Rising  \u2013 Percussive Return\". In the December 2012 Rolling Stone cover story \"Jimmy Page Looks Back\", Page said: \"... there was a request, suggesting that Lucifer Rising should come out again with my music on. I ignored it.\"\n\nAlthough Page collected works by Crowley, he has never described himself as a [[Thelemite]] nor was he ever initiated into the [[Typhonian Order|OTO]]. The Equinox Bookstore and Boleskine House were both sold off during the 1980s, as Page settled into family life and participated in charity work.\n\n==Discography==\n{{main|Jimmy Page discography}}\n\nEarly in his career, Page played on a number of recordings by British rock and pop artists as a session guitarist. As a member of the Yardbirds, he recorded ''[[Little Games]]'' (1967) (expanded in 1992 as ''Little Games Sessions & More''), ''[[Live Yardbirds: Featuring Jimmy Page|Live Yardbirds! Featuring Jimmy Page]]'' (1971), and ''[[Cumular Limit]]'' (2000). Beginning in 1968, he recorded nine albums with Led Zeppelin (see [[Led Zeppelin discography]] for the complete list). After Zeppelin, Page has recorded in several different settings. One of the first is the soundtrack album ''[[Death Wish II (album)|Death Wish II]]'' (1982). As a member of the Firm, he recorded ''[[The Firm (album)|The Firm]]'' (1985) and ''[[Mean Business]]'' (1986). Collaborations followed, including ''[[Whatever Happened to Jugula?]]'' (1985) with Roy Harper, ''[[Coverdale\u2022Page (album)|Coverdale\u2022Page]]'' (1993), ''[[Walking into Clarksdale]]'' (1998) with Robert Plant, and ''[[Live at the Greek]]'' (2000) with the Black Crowes. His only solo album, ''[[Outrider (album)|Outrider]]'', was released in 1988. As a guest performer, he has contributed to several albums and singles.\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* {{cite book|last1=Bacon|first1=Tony|last2=Burrluck|first2=Dave|last3=Day|first3=Paul|last4=Wright|first4=Michael|year=2000|title=Electric Guitars: The Illustrated Encyclopedia|url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=ZSIUAQAAIAAJ}}|location=San Diego, CA|publisher=Thunder Bay Press|isbn=978-1-57145-281-8|ref=CITEREFBacon2000}}\n* {{cite book|last=Cole|first=Richard|authorlink=Richard Cole|year=1992|title=Stairway to Heaven: Led Zeppelin Uncensored|location=New York City|publisher=HarperCollins Publishers|url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=fUxrSOrrzM8C}}|isbn=978-0-06-018323-3|ref=CITEREFCole1992}}\n* {{cite book|last=Case|first=George|year=2007|title=Jimmy Page: Magus, Musician, Man: An Unauthorized Biography|edition=1st|location=New York|publisher=Hal Leonard|url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=OsbuBD3mkkkC}}|isbn=1-4234-0407-6|ref=CITEREFCase2007}}\n* {{cite book|last1=Chipkin|first1=Kenn|last2=Stang|first2=Aaron|year=2003|title=Real Rock Guitar: A Classic Rock Bible of the '60s and '70s|location=Miami, FL|publisher=Warner Bros.

But I was still playing.<ref name=\"PP75\" />}}\n\n== Career ==\n=== Early 1960s: session musician ===\nWhile still a student, Page often performed on stage at the [[Marquee Club]] with bands such as [[Cyril Davies]]' [[All-Stars (band)|All Stars]], [[Alexis Korner]]'s [[Blues Incorporated]], and fellow guitarists [[Jeff Beck]] and [[Eric Clapton]]. He was spotted one night by John Gibb of Brian Howard & the Silhouettes, who asked him to help record some singles for [[Columbia Graphophone Company]], including \"The Worrying Kind\". [[Mike Leander]] of [[Decca Records]] first offered Page regular studio work. His first session for the label was the recording \"[[Diamonds (Jerry Lordan song)|Diamonds]]\" by [[Jet Harris]] and [[Tony Meehan]], which went to Number 1 on the singles chart in early 1963.<ref name=\"Schulps\" />\n\nAfter brief stints with [[Carter-Lewis and the Southerners]], [[Mike Hurst (producer)|Mike Hurst]] and the Method and [[Mickey Finn (guitarist)|Mickey Finn and the Blue Men]], Page committed himself to full-time session work. As a session guitarist, he was known as 'Lil' Jim Pea' to prevent confusion with the other noted English session guitarist [[Big Jim Sullivan]]. Page was mainly called into sessions as \"insurance\" in instances when a replacement or second guitarist was required by the recording artist. \"It was usually myself and a drummer\", he explained, \"though they never mention the drummer these days, just me&nbsp;... Anyone needing a guitarist either went to Big Jim [Sullivan] or myself.\"<ref name=\"Schulps\" /> He stated that \"In the initial stages they just said, play what you want, cos at that time I couldn't read music or anything.\"<ref name=DuNoyer>{{cite journal|last=Paul|first=Du Noyer|title=Who the hell does Jimmy Page think he is?|work=[[Q (magazine)|Q]] magazine|issue=August 1988|pages=5\u20137}}</ref>\n\n{{listen|type=music\n| filename = Jimmy Page - She Just Satisfies.ogg\n| title = She Just Satisfies\n| description = Sample of \"She Just Satisfies\", Page's first single (released in 1965).<ref>{{cite book|author=George Case|title=Jimmy Page: Magus, Musician, Man: An Unauthorized Biography|date=1 April 2009|publisher=Backbeat Books|url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=N3o3AQAAIAAJ}} |isbn=978-0-87930-947-3 |page=43}}</ref>\n| pos = right\n}}\n\nPage was the favoured session guitarist of record producer [[Shel Talmy]].

He composed and recorded songs for the John Williams (not to be confused with the film composer [[John Williams]]) album ''The Maureeny Wishful Album'' with Big Jim Sullivan. Page worked as session musician on [[Donovan]] Leitch's ''[[Sunshine Superman (album)|Sunshine Superman]]'' and the [[Johnny Hallyday]] albums ''Jeune Homme'' and ''Je Suis N\u00e9 Dans La Rue'', the [[Al Stewart]] album ''[[Love Chronicles]]'' and played guitar on five tracks of [[Joe Cocker]]'s debut album, ''[[With a Little Help from My Friends (Joe Cocker album)|With a Little Help from My Friends]]''. Over the years since 1970, Page played lead guitar on 10 [[Roy Harper (singer)|Roy Harper]] tracks, comprising 81 minutes of music.\n\nWhen questioned about which songs he played on, especially ones where there exists some controversy as to what his exact role was, Page often points out that it is hard to remember exactly what he did given the enormous number of sessions he was playing at the time.<ref name=\"DuNoyer\"/><ref name=\"tripleJ\" /> In a radio interview he explained that \"I was doing three sessions a day, fifteen sessions a week. Sometimes I would be playing with a group, sometimes I could be doing film music, it could be a folk session&nbsp;... I was able to fit all these different roles.\"<ref name=\"NPRPage\"/>\n\nAlthough Page recorded with many notable musicians, many of these early tracks are only available as [[bootleg recording]]s, several of which were released by the Led Zeppelin fan club in the late 1970s. One of the rarest of these is the early jam session featuring him and Stones guitarist [[Keith Richards]] covering [[Robert Johnson]]'s \"Little Queen of Spades\". Several early tracks were compiled on the twin album release, ''[[Jimmy Page: Session Man]]''. He also recorded with Richards on guitar and vocals in [[Olympic Sound Studios]] on 15 October 1974. Along with [[Ric Grech]] on bass and [[Bruce Rowland]] on drums, a track called \"Scarlet\" was cut. Page reflected later in an interview with ''Rolling Stone''{{'}}s [[Cameron Crowe]]: \"I did what could possibly be the next Stones B side. It was Ric Grech, Keith and me doing a number called \"Scarlet.\" I can't remember the drummer. It sounded very similar in style and mood to those ''Blonde on Blonde'' tracks. It was great, really good. We stayed up all night and went down to Island Studios where Keith put some reggae guitars over one section. I just put some solos on it, but it was eight in the morning of the next day before I did that. He took the tapes to Switzerland and someone found out about them. Keith told people that it was a track from my album\".<ref name=\"PP75\" />\n\nPage left studio work when the increasing influence of [[Stax Records]] on popular music led to the greater incorporation of brass and orchestral arrangements into recordings at the expense of guitars.<ref name=\"JPinterview\" /> He stated that his time as a session player served as extremely good schooling:\n{{quote|My session work was invaluable. At one point I was playing at least three sessions a day, six days a week! And I rarely ever knew in advance what I was going to be playing. But I learned things even on my worst sessions \u2013 and believe me, I played on some horrendous things. I finally called it quits after I started getting calls to do [[Elevator music|Muzak]]. I decided I couldn't live that life any more; it was getting too silly. I guess it was destiny that a week after I quit doing sessions Paul Samwell-Smith left the Yardbirds and I was able to take his place. But being a session musician was good fun in the beginning \u2013 the studio discipline was great. They'd just count the song off and you couldn't make any mistakes.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />}}\n\n=== Late 1960s: The Yardbirds ===\n{{Main|The Yardbirds}}\n\nIn late 1964, Page was approached about the possibility of replacing Eric Clapton in the Yardbirds, but he declined out of loyalty to his friend.<ref name=\"Schulps\" /> In February 1965, Clapton quit the Yardbirds and Page was formally offered his spot, but unwilling to give up his lucrative career as a session musician and worried about his health under touring conditions, he suggested his friend Jeff Beck.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.ainian.com/HitParader_April66.pdf|journal=[[Hit Parader]]|issue=April 1966|title=Jeff Beck Interview (PDF)|accessdate=12 January 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100917085935/http://ainian.com/HitParader_April66.pdf|archive-date=17 September 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> On 16 May 1966, drummer [[Keith Moon]], bass player [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]], keyboardist [[Nicky Hopkins]], Beck and Page recorded \"[[Beck's Bolero]]\" in London's [[IBC Studios]]. The experience gave Page an idea to form a new [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] featuring Beck, along with [[The Who]]'s [[John Entwistle]] on bass and Moon on drums.<ref name=\"Schulps\" /> However, the lack of a quality vocalist and contractual problems prevented the project from getting off the ground. During this time, Moon suggested the name \"Lead [[Zeppelin]]\" for the first time, after Entwistle commented that the proceedings would take to the air like a lead balloon.\n\nWithin weeks, Page attended a Yardbirds concert at [[Oxford]]. After the show, he went backstage where [[Paul Samwell-Smith]] announced that he was leaving the group.<ref name=\"JPinterview\" /> Page offered to replace Samwell-Smith, and this was accepted by the group. He initially played electric bass with the Yardbirds before finally switching to twin lead guitar with Beck when [[Chris Dreja]] moved to bass. The musical potential of the line-up was scuttled, however, by interpersonal conflicts caused by constant touring and a lack of commercial success, although they released one single, \"[[Happenings Ten Years Time Ago]]\". While Page and Beck played together in the Yardbirds, the trio of Page, Beck and Clapton never played in the original group at the same time. The three guitarists did appear on stage together at the [[ARMS Charity Concert]]s in 1983.\n\nAfter Beck's departure, the Yardbirds remained a quartet. They recorded one album with Page on lead guitar, ''[[Little Games]]''. The album received indifferent reviews and was not a commercial success, peaking at number 80 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. Though their studio sound was fairly commercial at the time, the band's live performances were just the opposite, becoming heavier and more experimental. These concerts featured musical aspects that Page would later perfect with Led Zeppelin, most notably performances of \"[[Dazed and Confused (song)#Led Zeppelin live performances|Dazed and Confused]]\".\n\nAfter the departure of [[Keith Relf]] and [[Jim McCarty]] in 1968, Page reconfigured the group with a new line-up to fulfil unfinished tour dates in Scandinavia. To this end, Page recruited vocalist [[Robert Plant]] and drummer [[John Bonham]], and he was also contacted by [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]], who asked to join.<ref name=\"Miserandino\">{{cite web|url=http://thecelebritycafe.com/interviews/john_paul_jones.html|title=Led Zeppelin : John talks about his musical career with Led Zeppelin, before and after|first=Dominick A.|last=Miserandino|work=TheCelebrityCafe.com|date=29 November 2000|accessdate=18 February 2015}}</ref> During the [[Led Zeppelin Scandinavian Tour 1968|Scandinavian tour]], the new group appeared as the New Yardbirds, but soon recalled the old joke by Keith Moon and John Entwistle.

Various sources estimate the group's worldwide sales at more than 200 or even 300 million albums. With 111.5 million RIAA-certified units, they are the second-best-selling band in the United States. Each of their nine studio albums reached the top 10 of the US Billboard album chart, and six reached the number-one spot.\n\nLed Zeppelin were the progenitors of heavy metal and hard rock, and their sound was largely the product of Page's input as a producer and musician. The band's individualistic style drew from a wide variety of influences. They performed on multiple record-breaking concert tours, which also earned them a reputation for excess. Although they remained commercially and critically successful, in the later 1970s, the band's output and touring schedule were limited by the personal difficulties of the members.\n\nPage explained that he had a very specific idea in mind as to what he wanted Led Zeppelin to be, from the very beginning:\n{{quote|I had a lot of ideas from my days with the Yardbirds. The Yardbirds allowed me to improvise a lot in live performance and I started building a textbook of ideas that I eventually used in Zeppelin. In addition to those ideas, I wanted to add acoustic textures. Ultimately, I wanted Zeppelin to be a marriage of blues, hard rock and acoustic music topped with heavy choruses \u2013 a combination that had never been done before. Lots of light and shade in the music.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />}}\n\n=== Post-Led Zeppelin career ===\nLed Zeppelin broke up in 1980 following the death of Bonham at Page's home. Page initially refused to touch a guitar, grieving for his friend.<ref name=\"DuNoyer\"/><ref name=\"uncutinterview\">{{cite web|url=http://www.uncut.co.uk/features/john-paul-jones-on-jimmy-page-37701|first=David|last=Cavanagh|title=John Paul Jones on Jimmy Page|work=[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]]|date=29 December 2008|accessdate=18 February 2015}}</ref> For the rest of the 1980s, his work consisted of a series of short-term collaborations in the bands [[The Firm (rock band)|the Firm]], [[the Honeydrippers]], reunions and individual work, including film soundtracks. He also became active in philanthropic work.\n\n===1980s===\n[[File:Jimmy Page 1983.jpg|thumb|upright|Page in 1983]]\n\nPage made a return to the stage at a Jeff Beck show in March 1981 at the [[Hammersmith Odeon]].{{sfn|Case|2007|p=164}} Also in 1981, Page joined with [[Yes (band)|Yes]] bassist [[Chris Squire]] and drummer [[Alan White (Yes drummer)|Alan White]] to form a supergroup called [[XYZ (UK band)|XYZ]] (for former Yes-Zeppelin). They rehearsed several times, but the project was shelved. Bootlegs of these sessions revealed that some of the material emerged on later projects, notably The Firm's \"Fortune Hunter\" and Yes songs \"Mind Drive\" and \"Can You Imagine?\". Page joined Yes on stage in 1984 at [[Westfalenhalle]] in [[Dortmund]], Germany, playing \"[[I'm Down]]\".\n\nIn 1982, Page collaborated with director [[Michael Winner]] to record the ''[[Death Wish II (album)|Death Wish II]]'' soundtrack. This and several subsequent Page recordings, including the ''[[Death Wish III]]'' soundtrack, were recorded and produced at his recording studio, [[Sol Studios|The Sol]] in [[Cookham]], which he had purchased from [[Gus Dudgeon]] in the early 1980s.\n\n[[File:Jimmy Page - A.R.M.S. Concert, Oakland, Ca. 1983.jpg|thumb|left|Page at an A.R.M.S. concert in 1983]]\n\nIn 1983, Page appeared with the A.R.M.S. (Action Research for [[Multiple Sclerosis]]) charity series of concerts which honoured [[Small Faces]] bassist [[Ronnie Lane]], who suffered from the disease. For the first shows at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] in London, Page's set consisted of songs from the ''Death Wish II'' soundtrack (with [[Steve Winwood]] on vocals) and an instrumental version of \"Stairway to Heaven\". A four-city tour of the United States followed, with [[Paul Rodgers]] of [[Bad Company]] replacing Winwood. During the tour, Page and Rodgers performed \"Midnight Moonlight\", which would later appear on The Firm's first album. All of the shows featured an on stage jam of \"[[Layla]]\" that reunited Page with Beck and Clapton. According to the book ''[[Hammer of the Gods (book)|Hammer of the Gods]]'', it was reportedly around this time that Page told friends that he had just ended seven years of heroin use. On 13 December 1983, Page joined Plant on stage for one encore at the Hammersmith Odeon in London.\n\nPage next linked up with [[Roy Harper (singer)|Roy Harper]] for the 1984 album ''[[Whatever Happened to Jugula?]]'' and occasional concerts, performing a predominantly acoustic set at folk festivals under various guises such as the MacGregors and Themselves. Also in 1984, Page recorded with Plant as the Honeydrippers the album ''[[The Honeydrippers: Volume 1]]'' and with [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]] on the film soundtrack ''[[Scream for Help (album)|Scream for Help]]''.\n\nPage subsequently collaborated with Rodgers on two albums under the name [[The Firm (rock band)|The Firm]]. The first album, released in 1985, was the self-titled ''[[The Firm (album)|The Firm]]''. Popular songs included \"[[Radioactive (The Firm song)|Radioactive]]\" and \"Satisfaction Guaranteed\". The album peaked at number 17 on the ''Billboard'' pop albums chart and went gold in the US. It was followed by ''[[Mean Business]]'' in 1986. The band toured in support of both albums, but soon split up.\n\nVarious other projects followed, such as session work for [[Graham Nash]], [[Stephen Stills]] and the Rolling Stones (on their 1986 single \"[[One Hit (to the Body)]]\"). In 1986, Page reunited temporarily with his former Yardbirds bandmates to play on several tracks of the [[Box of Frogs]] album ''Strange Land''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3534576.stm|title=Zeppelin defend Live Aid opt out|work=BBC News|date=4 August 2004|accessdate=11 September 2010}}</ref> Page released a solo album entitled ''[[Outrider (album)|Outrider]]'' in 1988, which featured contributions from Plant, with Page contributing in turn to Plant's solo album ''[[Now and Zen]]'', which was released the same year.

However, the band members considered this performance to be sub-standard, with Page having been let down by a poorly tuned Les Paul. Page, Plant and Jones, as well as John Bonham's son [[Jason Bonham|Jason]], performed at the [[Atlantic Records 40th Anniversary]] show on 14 May 1988, closing the 12-hour show.{{sfn|Lewis|Pallett|2005|p=139}}\n\n===1990s===\nIn 1990, a [[Concerts at Knebworth House|Knebworth]] concert to aid the Nordoff-Robbins Music Therapy Centre and the British School for Performing Arts and Technology saw Plant unexpectedly joined by Page to perform \"[[Misty Mountain Hop]]\", \"[[Wearing and Tearing]]\" and \"[[Rock and Roll (Led Zeppelin song)|Rock and Roll]]\". The same year, Page appeared with [[Aerosmith]] at the [[Monsters of Rock]] festival. Page also performed with the band's former members at Jason Bonham's wedding. Page also embarked on a collaboration with [[David Coverdale]] in 1993 entitled [[Coverdale Page]].\n\nIn 1994, Page reunited with Plant for the penultimate performance in MTV's \"[[MTV Unplugged|Unplugged]]\" series. The 90-minute special, dubbed ''Unledded'', premiered to the highest ratings in MTV's history. In October of the same year, the session was released as the CD ''[[No Quarter: Jimmy Page and Robert Plant Unledded]]'' and in 2004 as the DVD ''[[No Quarter Unledded]]''. Following a highly successful mid-1990s tour to support ''No Quarter'', Page and Plant recorded 1998's ''[[Walking into Clarksdale]]'', along with drummer [[Michael Lee (musician)|Michael Lee]].\n\nPage was heavily involved in [[remaster]]ing the Led Zeppelin catalogue. He participated in various charity concerts and charity work, particularly the ''Action for Brazil's Children Trust'' (ABC Trust), founded by his wife Jimena Gomez-Paratcha in 1998. In the same year, Page played guitar for [[Hip hop music|rap]] singer/producer [[Puff Daddy]]'s song \"[[Come with Me (Puff Daddy & Jimmy Page song)|Come with Me]]\", which heavily samples Led Zeppelin's \"[[Kashmir (song)|Kashmir]]\" and was included in the soundtrack of ''[[Godzilla (1998 film)|Godzilla]]''. The two later performed the song on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''.\n\nIn October 1999, Page teamed up with [[The Black Crowes]] for a two-night performance of material from the Led Zeppelin catalogue and old blues and rock standards. The concert was recorded and released as a [[double album|double live album]], ''[[Live at the Greek]]'' in 2000. In 2001, he made an appearance on stage with [[Limp Bizkit]] frontman [[Fred Durst]] and [[Wes Scantlin]] of [[Puddle of Mudd]] at the MTV Europe Video Music Awards in [[Frankfurt]], where they performed a version of Led Zeppelin's \"[[Thank You (Led Zeppelin song)|Thank You]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://music.yahoo.com/read/news/12051457|title=Led Zep's Page Joins Limp Bizkit's Durst And Puddle of Mudd's Scantlin On Stage|accessdate=17 February 2007|date=11 October 2001|publisher=Yahoo|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070616141509/http://music.yahoo.com/read/news/12051457|archivedate=16 June 2007}}</ref>\n\n===2000s===\n[[File:JimmyPage.jpg|thumb|upright|Jimmy Page performing at the Led Zeppelin reunion concert at [[the O2 Arena]] in London in 2007]]\n\nIn 2005, Page was appointed [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] (OBE) in recognition of his Brazilian charity work for Task Brazil and Action For Brazil's Children's Trust,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/arts/story/2005/12/14/page-obe.html|title=Jimmy Page given OBE for charity work|accessdate=6 January 2007|date=14 December 2005|work=CBC.ca Arts|publisher=CBC|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312030202/http://www.cbc.ca/arts/story/2005/12/14/page-obe.html|archivedate=12 March 2007}}</ref> made an honorary citizen of [[Rio de Janeiro]] later that year and was awarded a Grammy Award.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4271212.stm|title=Zeppelin's Page made Rio citizen|accessdate=6 January 2007|date=22 September 2006|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC}}</ref>\n\nIn November 2006, Led Zeppelin was inducted into the [[UK Music Hall of Fame]].

I started to learn microphone placements and things like that, what did and what didn't work. I certainly knew what did and didn't work with drummers because they put drummers in these little sound booths that had no sound deflection at all and the drums would just sound awful. The reality of it is the drum is a musical instrument, it relies on having a bright room and a live room&nbsp;... And so bit by bit I was learning really how ''not'' to record.<ref name=\"NPRPage\"/></blockquote>\n\nHe developed a reputation for employing effects in new ways and trying out different methods of using microphones and amplification. During the late 1960s, most British music producers placed [[microphone]]s directly in front of [[amplifier]]s and drums, resulting in the sometimes \"tinny\" sound of the recordings of the era. Page commented to ''Guitar World'' magazine that he felt the drum sounds of the day in particular \"sounded like cardboard boxes.\"<ref name=\"guiwo\" /> Instead, Page was a fan of 1950s recording techniques, [[Sun Studio]] being a particular favourite. In the same ''Guitar World'' interview, Page remarked: \"Recording used to be a science\" and \"[engineers] used to have a maxim: distance equals depth.\" Taking this maxim to heart, Page developed the idea of placing an additional microphone some distance from the amplifier (as much as twenty feet) and then recording the balance between the two. By adopting this technique, Page became one of the first British producers to record a band's \"ambient sound\" \u2013 the distance of a note's time-lag from one end of the room to the other.<ref name=\"RS2006\"/>\n\nFor the recording of several Led Zeppelin tracks, such as \"[[Whole Lotta Love]]\" and \"[[You Shook Me]]\", Page additionally utilised \"[[reverse echo]]\" \u2013 a technique which he claims to have invented himself while with the Yardbirds (he had originally developed the method when recording the 1967 single \"[[Ten Little Indians (Harry Nilsson song)|Ten Little Indians]]\").<ref name=\"guiwo\"/> This production technique involved hearing the echo before the main sound instead of after it, achieved by turning the tape over and employing the echo on a spare track, then turning the tape back over again to get the echo preceding the signal.\n\nPage has stated that, as producer, he deliberately changed the [[audio engineer]]s on Led Zeppelin albums, from [[Glyn Johns]] for the first album, to [[Eddie Kramer]] for ''[[Led Zeppelin II]]'', to [[Andy Johns]] for ''[[Led Zeppelin III]]'' and later albums. He explained: \"I consciously kept changing engineers because I didn't want people to think that they were responsible for our sound. I wanted people to know it was me.\"<ref name=\"guiwo\" />\n\nJohn Paul Jones acknowledged that Page's production techniques were a key component of the success of Led Zeppelin:\n\n{{quote|The backwards echo stuff [and] a lot of the microphone techniques were just inspired. Using distance-miking&nbsp;... and small amplifiers. Everybody thinks we go in the studio with huge walls of amplifiers, but Page doesn't. He uses a really small amplifier and he just mikes it up really well, so that it fits into a sonic picture.<ref name=\"uncutinterview\"/>}}\n\nIn an interview that Page himself gave to ''Guitar World'' magazine in 1993, he remarked on his work as a producer:\n\n{{quote|Many people think of me as just a riff guitarist, but I think of myself in broader terms&nbsp;... As a record producer I would like to be remembered as someone who was able to sustain a band of unquestionable individual talent and push it to the forefront during its working career. I think I really captured the best of our output, growth, change and maturity on tape \u2013 the multifaceted gem that is Led Zeppelin.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />}}\n\n==Personal life==\n===Partners===\nAn early 1960s companion was American recording artist [[Jackie DeShannon]], possibly the inspiration for the Page composition and Led Zeppelin recording \"Tangerine\".{{sfn|Lewis|2012|p=44}}\n\nFrench model Charlotte Martin was Page's partner from 1970 to about 1982 or 1983. Page called her \"My Lady\". Together they had a daughter, [[Scarlet Page]] (born in 1971), who is a photographer.\n\nAlso during the 1970s, Page had a well-documented, several-year-long relationship with \"baby groupie\" [[Lori Mattix]] (also known as Lori Maddox), beginning when she was 13 or 14 and while he was an adult in his twenties. In light of the [[Me Too movement]] four decades later, this attracted renewed attention as [[statutory rape]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/@msullivangates/a-word-on-david-bowie-lori-mattix-and-the-speed-of-information-b38681f24cf4|title=A Word on David Bowie, Lori Mattix, and the Speed of Information|publisher=Medium.com|accessdate=12 September 2018}}{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/the-10-wildest-led-zeppelin-legends-fact-checked-20121121/jimmy-page-dated-a-14-year-old-girl-while-he-was-in-led-zeppelin-19691231|title=Jimmy Page Dated a 14-year-old Girl While He Was in Led Zeppelin \u2013 The 10 Wildest Led Zeppelin Legends, Fact-Checked|website=Rolling Stone|access-date=30 March 2016}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1986 to 1995, Page was married to Patricia Ecker, a model and waitress.

He later said that following this discovery, he thought: \"Yes, that's it. My thing: I've found it.\"{{sfn|Salewicz|2018|p=33}}\n\nThe appearance of four symbols on the jacket of Led Zeppelin's [[Led Zeppelin IV|fourth album]] has been linked to Page's interest in the occult.<ref name=\"GW2008\">''Jimmy Page interview'', ''Guitar World'', January 2008.</ref> The four symbols represented each member of the band. Page's own so-called \"Zoso\" symbol originated in ''Ars Magica Arteficii'' (1557) by [[Gerolamo Cardano]], an old alchemical [[grimoire]], where it has been identified as a [[sigil (magic)|sigil]] consisting of zodiac signs. The sigil is reproduced in ''Dictionary of Occult, Hermetic and Alchemical Sigils'' by Fred Gettings.{{sfn|Gettings|1981|p=201}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.inthelight.co.nz/ledzep/zososymbol.htm|title=Jimmy Page's symbol|date=17 September 2009|accessdate=4 December 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222124002/http://www.inthelight.co.nz/ledzep/zososymbol.htm|archivedate=22 February 2012}}\n</ref>\n\nDuring tours and performances after the release of the fourth album, Page often had the \"Zoso\" symbol embroidered on his clothes, along with [[zodiac]] symbols. These were visible most notably on his \"Dragon Suit\", which included the signs for Capricorn, Scorpio and Cancer which are Page's Sun, Ascendant and Moon signs, respectively.\n\nThe artwork inside the album cover of ''Led Zeppelin IV'' is from a painting attributed to the artist Barrington Colby, influenced by the traditional Rider/Waite Tarot card design for the card called \"The Hermit\". Very little is known about Colby and rumours have persisted down the years that Page himself is responsible for the painting.<ref name=\"GW2008\" /> Page transforms into this character during his fantasy sequence in Led Zeppelin's concert film ''The Song Remains the Same''.\n\nIn the early 1970s Page owned an occult bookshop and publishing house, The Equinox Booksellers and Publishers, at 4 [[Holland Street, Kensington|Holland Street]] in [[Kensington]], London, named after Crowley's biannual magazine, ''[[The Equinox]]''.{{sfn|Salewicz|2018|p=289}} The design of the interior incorporated Egyptian and Art Deco motifs, with Crowley's birth chart affixed to a wall. Page's reasons for setting up the bookshop were straightforward:\n<blockquote>There was not one bookshop in London with a good collection of occult books and I was so pissed off at not being able to get the books I wanted.{{sfn|Salewicz|2018|p=289}}</blockquote>\n\nThe company published two books: a facsimile of Crowley's 1904 edition of ''[[The Goetia]]''<ref name=\"Tolinski2012\">{{cite book|author=Brad Tolinski|title=Light and Shade: Conversations with Jimmy Page|year=2012|publisher=Virgin|url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=6gzUbV5AJQYC}}|isbn=978-0-7535-4039-8|page=183}}</ref> and ''Astrology, A Cosmic Science'' by Isabel Hickey.{{sfn|Salewicz|2018|p=290}} The lease eventually expired on the premises and was not renewed. As Page said: \"It obviously wasn't going to run the way it should without some drastic business changes, and I didn't really want to have to agree to all that. I basically just wanted the shop to be the nucleus, that's all.\"{{sfn|Salewicz|2018|p=410}}\n\nPage has maintained a strong interest in Crowley for many years. In 1978, he explained:\n\n{{quote|I feel Aleister Crowley is a misunderstood genius of the 20th century. It is because his whole thing was liberation of the person, of the entity and that restrictions would foul you up, lead to frustration which leads to violence, crime, mental breakdown, depending on what sort of makeup you have underneath. The further this age we're in now gets into technology and alienation, a lot of the points he's made seem to manifest themselves all down the line. ... I'm not saying it's a system for anybody to follow. I don't agree with everything but I find a lot of it relevant and it's those things that people attacked him on, so he was misunderstood. ... I'm not trying to interest anyone in Aleister Crowley any more than I am in Charles Dickens. All it was, was that at a particular time he was expounding a theory of self-liberation, which is something which is so important. He was like an eye to the world, into the forthcoming situation. My studies have been quite intensive, but I don't particularly want to go into it because it's a personal thing and isn't in relation to anything apart from the fact that I've employed his system in my own day to day life. ... The thing is to come to terms with one's free will, discover one's place and what one is, and from that you can go ahead and do it and not spend your whole life suppressed and frustrated. It's very basically coming to terms with yourself.<ref>''[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]'', 13&nbsp;March 1978.</ref>}}\n\nPage was commissioned to write the soundtrack music for the film ''[[Lucifer Rising (film)|Lucifer Rising]]'' by Crowley admirer and underground movie director [[Kenneth Anger]]. Page ultimately produced 23 minutes of music, which Anger felt was insufficient because the film ran for 28 minutes and Anger wanted the film to have a full soundtrack. Anger claimed Page took three years to deliver the music and the final product was only 23 minutes of \"droning\". The director also slammed the guitarist in the press by calling him a \"dabbler\" in the occult and an addict and being too strung out on drugs to complete the project. Page countered that he had fulfilled all his obligations, even going so far as to lend Anger his own film editing equipment to help him finish the project.<ref name=\"GW2006\">''The Story Behind The Lost Lucifer Rising Soundtrack'', ''[[Guitar World]]'', October 2006.</ref> Page released the Lucifer Rising music on vinyl in 2012 via his website on \"Lucifer Rising and other sound tracks\". Side one contained \"Lucifer Rising \u2013 Main Track\", whilst side two contained the tracks \"Incubus\", \"Damask\", \"Unharmonics\", \"Damask \u2013 Ambient\", and \"Lucifer Rising  \u2013 Percussive Return\". In the December 2012 Rolling Stone cover story \"Jimmy Page Looks Back\", Page said: \"... there was a request, suggesting that Lucifer Rising should come out again with my music on. I ignored it.\"\n\nAlthough Page collected works by Crowley, he has never described himself as a [[Thelemite]] nor was he ever initiated into the [[Typhonian Order|OTO]]. The Equinox Bookstore and Boleskine House were both sold off during the 1980s, as Page settled into family life and participated in charity work.\n\n==Discography==\n{{main|Jimmy Page discography}}\n\nEarly in his career, Page played on a number of recordings by British rock and pop artists as a session guitarist. As a member of the Yardbirds, he recorded ''[[Little Games]]'' (1967) (expanded in 1992 as ''Little Games Sessions & More''), ''[[Live Yardbirds: Featuring Jimmy Page|Live Yardbirds! Featuring Jimmy Page]]'' (1971), and ''[[Cumular Limit]]'' (2000). Beginning in 1968, he recorded nine albums with Led Zeppelin (see [[Led Zeppelin discography]] for the complete list). After Zeppelin, Page has recorded in several different settings. One of the first is the soundtrack album ''[[Death Wish II (album)|Death Wish II]]'' (1982). As a member of the Firm, he recorded ''[[The Firm (album)|The Firm]]'' (1985) and ''[[Mean Business]]'' (1986). Collaborations followed, including ''[[Whatever Happened to Jugula?]]'' (1985) with Roy Harper, ''[[Coverdale\u2022Page (album)|Coverdale\u2022Page]]'' (1993), ''[[Walking into Clarksdale]]'' (1998) with Robert Plant, and ''[[Live at the Greek]]'' (2000) with the Black Crowes. His only solo album, ''[[Outrider (album)|Outrider]]'', was released in 1988. As a guest performer, he has contributed to several albums and singles.\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* {{cite book|last1=Bacon|first1=Tony|last2=Burrluck|first2=Dave|last3=Day|first3=Paul|last4=Wright|first4=Michael|year=2000|title=Electric Guitars: The Illustrated Encyclopedia|url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=ZSIUAQAAIAAJ}}|location=San Diego, CA|publisher=Thunder Bay Press|isbn=978-1-57145-281-8|ref=CITEREFBacon2000}}\n* {{cite book|last=Cole|first=Richard|authorlink=Richard Cole|year=1992|title=Stairway to Heaven: Led Zeppelin Uncensored|location=New York City|publisher=HarperCollins Publishers|url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=fUxrSOrrzM8C}}|isbn=978-0-06-018323-3|ref=CITEREFCole1992}}\n* {{cite book|last=Case|first=George|year=2007|title=Jimmy Page: Magus, Musician, Man: An Unauthorized Biography|edition=1st|location=New York|publisher=Hal Leonard|url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=OsbuBD3mkkkC}}|isbn=1-4234-0407-6|ref=CITEREFCase2007}}\n* {{cite book|last1=Chipkin|first1=Kenn|last2=Stang|first2=Aaron|year=2003|title=Real Rock Guitar: A Classic Rock Bible of the '60s and '70s|location=Miami, FL|publisher=Warner Bros.

Scheduled for the first full week of April, the Masters is the first major of the year, and unlike the others, it is always held at the same location, [[Augusta National Golf Club]], a private course in the [[southeastern United States]], in the city of [[Augusta, Georgia]].\n\nThe Masters was started by [[Amateur sports#Golf|amateur]] champion [[Bobby Jones (golfer)|Bobby Jones]] and [[Investment banking|investment banker]] [[Clifford Roberts]].<ref name=\"Hist\">{{cite web |url=http://www.masters.com/en_US/tournament/milestones/index.html |title=Masters Milestones |publisher=www.masters.org |accessdate=February 9, 2016}}</ref> After his [[Grand Slam (golf)|grand slam]] in [[1930 U.S. Open (golf)|1930]], Jones acquired the former [[plant nursery]] and co-designed Augusta National with course architect [[Alister MacKenzie]].<ref name=itcpgat11/> First played {{Years or months ago|1934}} in [[1934 Masters Tournament|1934]], the tournament is an official money event on the [[PGA Tour]], the [[European Tour]], and the [[Japan Golf Tour]]. The field of players is smaller than those of the other major championships because it is an invitational event, held by the Augusta National Golf Club.\n\nThe tournament has a number of traditions. Since [[1949 Masters Tournament|1949]], a green jacket has been awarded to the champion, who must return it to the clubhouse one year after his victory, although it remains his personal property and is stored with other champions' jackets in a specially designated cloakroom. In most instances, only a first-time and currently reigning champion may remove his jacket from the club grounds. A golfer who wins the event multiple times uses the same green jacket awarded upon his initial win (unless he needs to be re-fitted with a new jacket).<ref>{{cite web |first=Brent |last=Kelley |title=Do Masters Champions Get to Keep the Green Jacket? |url=http://golf.about.com/od/majorchampionships/f/keep_jacket.htm |publisher=About.com}}</ref> The Champions Dinner, inaugurated by [[Ben Hogan]] in [[1952 Masters Tournament|1952]], is held on the Tuesday before each tournament, and is open only to past champions and certain board members of the Augusta National Golf Club. Beginning in [[1963 Masters Tournament|1963]], legendary golfers, usually past champions, have hit an honorary tee shot on the morning of the first round to commence play. These have included [[Fred McLeod]], [[Jock Hutchinson]], [[Gene Sarazen]], [[Sam Snead]], [[Byron Nelson]], [[Arnold Palmer]], [[Jack Nicklaus]], and [[Gary Player]]. Since [[1960 Masters Tournament|1960]], a [[Masters Tournament Par-3 contest|semi-social contest]] at the par-3 course has been played on Wednesday, the day before the first round.\n\nNicklaus has the most Masters wins, with six between 1963 and 1986. [[Tiger Woods]] has won five. Palmer has won four. Five have won three titles at Augusta: [[Jimmy Demaret]], [[Sam Snead]], [[Gary Player]], [[Nick Faldo]], and [[Phil Mickelson]]. Player, from [[South Africa]], was the first non-American player to win the tournament, in [[1961 Masters Tournament|1961]]; the second was [[Seve Ballesteros]] of [[Spain]], the champion in [[1980 Masters Tournament|1980]] and [[1983 Masters Tournament|1983]].\n\nThe Augusta National course first opened {{Years or months ago|1933}} in 1933 and has been modified many times by different architects. Among the changes: greens have been reshaped and, on occasion, entirely re-designed, bunkers have been added, water hazards have been extended, new tee boxes have been built, hundreds of trees have been planted, and several mounds have been installed.<ref name=\"Owen 1999\">{{cite book |title=The Making of the Masters: Clifford Roberts, Augusta National, and Golf's Most Prestigious Tournament |first=David |last=Owen |publisher=Simon & Schuster |year=1999 |isbn=978-0-684-85729-9}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:AugustaNationalMastersLogoFlowers.jpg|thumb|<center>Masters logo<br>at the club entrance</center>]]\n\n===Augusta National Golf Club===\n{{main|Augusta National Golf Club}}\nThe idea for Augusta National originated with [[Bobby Jones (golfer)|Bobby Jones]], who wanted to build a golf course after his retirement from the game.

In his first appearance at Augusta in 1981, he led during the second nine but ended up finishing fourth. In 1986, after birdieing holes 14 through 17 to tie Nicklaus for the lead, he badly pushed his 4-iron approach on 18 into the patrons surrounding the green and missed his par putt for a closing bogey.  In 1987, Norman lost a sudden-death playoff when [[Larry Mize]] holed out a remarkable 45-yard pitch shot to birdie the second playoff hole.

Norman finished in the top five at the Masters eight times but never won.\n\nTwo-time champion [[Ben Crenshaw]] captured an emotional Masters win in 1995, just days after the death of his lifelong teacher and mentor [[Harvey Penick]].   After making his final putt to win, he broke down sobbing at the hole and was consoled and embraced by his caddie.  In the post-tournament interview, Crenshaw said: \"I had a 15th club in my bag,\" a reference to Penick. (The \"15th club\" reference is based on the golf rule that limits a player to carrying 14 clubs during a round.)  Crenshaw first won at Augusta in 1984.\n\nIn 1997, 21 year-old [[Tiger Woods]] became the youngest champion in Masters history, winning by 12 shots with an 18-under par 270 which broke the 72-hole record that had stood for 32 years.<ref name=\"Hist\"/> In 2001 Woods completed his \"Tiger Slam\" by winning his fourth straight major championship at the Masters by two shots over [[David Duval]]. <ref name=past-results/> He won again the following year, making him only the third player in history (after Nicklaus and Faldo) to win the tournament in consecutive years,<ref name=past-results/> as well as in 2005 when he defeated [[Chris DiMarco]] in a playoff for his first major championship win in almost three years.<ref name=past-results/>\n\nThe club was targeted by [[Martha Burk]], who organized a failed protest at the 2003 Masters to pressure the club into accepting female members.

The green sport coat is the official attire worn by members of Augusta National while on the club grounds; each Masters winner becomes an honorary member of the club. The recipient of the green jacket has it presented to him inside the Butler Cabin soon after the end of the tournament in a televised ceremony, and the presentation is then repeated outside near the 18th green in front of the patrons. Winners keep their jacket for the year after their victory, then return it to the club to wear whenever they are present on the club grounds. [[Sam Snead]] was the first Masters champion to be awarded the green jacket after he took his first Masters title in 1949.\n\nThe green jacket is only allowed to be removed from the Augusta National grounds by the reigning champion, after which it must remain at the club. Exceptions to this rule include Gary Player, who in his joy of winning mistakenly took his jacket home to South Africa after his 1961 victory (although he has always followed the spirit of the rule and has never worn the jacket);<ref>{{cite news |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=lukas/070405 |title=The real story behind the green jacket |last=Lukas |first=Paul |work=ESPN |accessdate=November 18, 2008}}</ref> [[Seve Ballesteros]] who, in an interview with [[Peter Alliss]] from his home in Pedre\u00f1a, showed one of his two green jackets in his trophy room; and [[Henry Picard]], whose jacket was removed from the club before the tradition was well established, remained in his closet for a number of years, and is now on display at Canterbury Golf Club in [[Beachwood, Ohio]], where he was the club professional for many years.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.si.com/vault/1995/04/10/8093250/master-teacher-nearly-forgotten-now-teaching-pro-henry-picard-was-a-big-star-when-he-won-the-1938-masters |title=Master Teacher: Nearly forgotten now, teaching pro Henry Picard was a big star when he won the 1938 Masters |first=Rick |last=Lispey |magazine=Sports Illustrated |accessdate=February 9, 2016 |date=April 10, 1995}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ohiogolfandtravelguide.com/ohio/golf-news/michael-kernicki-hosts-major-championship-at-canterbury-golf-club.html |title=Michael Kernicki hosts Major Championship at Canterbury Golf Club |publisher=GolfGuide.com |accessdate=April 10, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101111083303/http://www.ohiogolfandtravelguide.com/ohio/golf-news/michael-kernicki-hosts-major-championship-at-canterbury-golf-club.html |archivedate=November 11, 2010 }}</ref>\n\nBy tradition, the winner of the previous year's Masters Tournament puts the jacket on the current winner at the end of the tournament.

For each [[Eagle (golf)|eagle]] a player makes he receives a pair of crystal goblets.\n\nIn addition to the green jacket, winners of the tournament receive a gold medal. In 2017, a green jacket that was found at a thrift store in 1994 was sold at auction for $139,000.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.thestar.com/sports/golf/2017/04/10/masters-style-green-jacket-bought-for-5-at-toronto-thrift-store-sells-for-139k.html |title=Masters-style green jacket bought for $5 at Toronto thrift store sells for $139K |newspaper=Toronto Star |agency=Associated Press |date=April 10, 2017 |access-date=April 11, 2017}}</ref>\n\n====Trophies====\nWinners also have their names engraved on the actual silver Masters trophy.

The first two rounds will be held at the Champion's Retreat club in [[Evans, Georgia]], with the final two rounds hosted by Augusta National (the final round will take place on the Saturday directly preceding the tournament). Ridley stated that holding such an event at Augusta National would have the \"greatest impact\" on women's golf. Although concerns were raised that the event would conflict with the [[LPGA Tour]]'s [[ANA Inspiration]] (which has invited top amateur players to compete), Ridley stated that he had discussed the event with commissioner [[Mike Whan]], and stated that he agreed on the notion that any move to bolster the prominence of women's golf would be a \"win\" for the LPGA over time.

Also, the current [[U.S. Amateur]] champion always plays in the same group as the defending Masters champion for the first two days of the tournament.\n\nAmateurs in the field are welcome to stay in the \"Crow's Nest\" atop the Augusta National clubhouse during the tournament. The Crow's Nest is {{convert|1200|sqft|-1}} with lodging space for five during the competition.\n\n===Opening tee shot===\nSince 1963, the custom in most years has been to start the tournament with an honorary opening tee shot at the first hole, typically by one or more legendary players. The original honorary starters were [[Jock Hutchison]] and [[Fred McLeod]]; this twosome led off every tournament from 1963 until 1973, when poor health prevented Hutchison from swinging a club. McLeod continued on until his death in 1976. Byron Nelson and Gene Sarazen started in 1981, and were then joined by Sam Snead in 1984. This trio continued until 1999 when Sarazen died, while Nelson stopped in 2001. Snead hit his final opening tee shot in 2002, a little over a month before he died.\n\nIn 2007, Arnold Palmer took over as the honorary starter.

Since [[1948 Masters Tournament|1948]], its final round has been scheduled for the second Sunday of April, with several exceptions. It ended on the first Sunday four times ([[1952 Masters Tournament|1952]], [[1957 Masters Tournament|1957]], [[1958 Masters Tournament|1958]], [[1959 Masters Tournament|1959]]) and the [[1979 Masters Tournament|1979]] and [[1984 Masters Tournament|1984]] tournaments ended on April 15, the month's third Sunday.<ref name=\"Hist\"/> The first edition in [[1934 Masters Tournament|1934]] was held in late March and the next ten were in early April, with only the [[1942 Masters Tournament|1942]] event scheduled to end on the second Sunday.  The [[2020 Masters Tournament|2020]] event, postponed by the [[COVID-19]] pandemic, is slated to be held in the autumn, with it being the last major of the year.\n\nSimilar to the other majors, the tournament consists of four rounds at 18 holes each, Thursday through Sunday (when there are no delays). The Masters has a relatively small field of contenders, when compared with other golf tournaments, so the competitors play in groups of three for the first two rounds (36 holes) and the field is not split to start on the 1st and 10th tees, unless weather shortens the available playing time, such as the second round in 1983, fourth round in 2019, and is expected for all four rounds in 2020. The tournament is unique in that it is the only major tournament conducted by a private club rather than a national golf organization like the PGA.<ref name=\"Owen 1999\" />\n\nOriginally, the Masters was the only tournament to use two-man pairings during the first two rounds. It was also the only event to re-pair based on the leaderboard before Friday's round, as most tournaments only do this on the weekend. This practice ended in the early 2000s, when the Masters switched to the more standard three-man groups and the groups are now kept intact on Friday, with players sharing the same playing partners in both of the first two rounds.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nAfter 36 holes of play, a cut-off score is calculated to reduce the size of the field for the weekend rounds. To \"make the cut\", players must be either in the top 50 places (ties counting), or within 10 strokes of the leader's score. These criteria have applied since [[2013 Masters Tournament|2013]].<ref name=cut>{{cite news |url=http://espn.go.com/golf/masters13/story/_/id/9156060/fall-tour-event-winners-get-masters-spot |title=Masters tweaks qualifications |first=Bob |last=Harig |work=ESPN |date=April 10, 2013 |access-date=April 16, 2013}}</ref> From 1957 to 1960, the top 40 scores (including ties) and those within 10 strokes of the leader made the cut. From 1961 to 2012, it was the top 44 (and ties) or within 10 strokes of the lead.<ref name=cut/> Before [[1957 Masters Tournament|1957]], there was no 36-hole cut and all of the invitees played four rounds, if desired.<ref name=\"Cut\">{{cite web |url=http://www.masters.org/en_US/history/records/cutinfo.html |title=Cut Information |publisher=www.masters.org |access-date=January 21, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080119025225/http://www.masters.org/en_US/history/records/cutinfo.html |archivedate=January 19, 2008}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the cut, an additional 36 holes are played over the final two days. Should the fourth round fail to produce a winner, all players tied for the lead enter a [[Sudden death (sport)#Golf|sudden-death]] playoff. Play begins on the 18th hole, followed by the adjacent 10th, repeating until one player remains.

Earlier playoffs were 18 holes on the following day, except for the first in [[1935 Masters Tournament|1935]], which was 36 holes; the last 18-hole playoff was in [[1970 Masters Tournament|1970]], and none of the full-round playoffs went to additional holes.\n\n==Course==\nThe golf course was formerly a [[plant nursery]] and each hole is named after the tree or shrub with which it has become associated.<ref name=nursbeaut/><br>\nThe course layout in [[2019 Masters Tournament|2019]]:\n{|class=wikitable style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n!Hole!!Name!!Yards!!Par!! !!Hole!!Name!!Yards!!Par\n|-\n|1||align=left|[[Tea Olive]]||445||4||rowspan=10| ||10||align=left|[[Camellia]]||495||4\n|-\n|2||align=left|[[Flowering dogwood|Pink Dogwood]]||575||5||11||align=left|[[White Dogwood]]||505||4\n|-\n|3||align=left|[[Peach|Flowering Peach]]||350||4||12||align=left|[[Forsythia|Golden Bell]]||155||3\n|-\n|4||align=left|[[Malus|Flowering Crab Apple]]||240||3||13||align=left|[[Azalea]]||510||5\n|-\n|5||align=left|[[Southern magnolia|Magnolia]]||495||4||14||align=left|[[Cunninghamia|Chinese Fir]]||440||4\n|-\n|6||align=left|[[Eastern Juniper|Juniper]]||180||3||15||align=left|[[Pyracantha|Firethorn]]||530||5\n|-\n|7||align=left|[[Cortaderia selloana|Pampas]]||450||4||16||align=left|[[Eastern Redbud|Redbud]]||170||3\n|-\n|8||align=left|[[Yellow Jessamine|Yellow Jasmine]]||570||5||17||align=left|[[Nandina]]||440||4\n|-\n|9||align=left|[[Prunus caroliniana|Carolina Cherry]]||460||4||18||align=left|[[American holly|Holly]]||465||4\n|-\n| colspan=2|'''Out'''||'''3,765'''||'''36'''|| colspan=2|'''In'''||'''3,710'''||'''36'''\n|-\n| colspan=\"5\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|<small>Source:</small><ref name=itcpgat11/><ref name=2012cstour>{{cite web|url=http://www.majorschampionships.com/masters/2012/course/tour/index.cfm |publisher=PGA of America: Major Championships |title=Course Tour: 2012 Masters |accessdate=August 24, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120827230002/http://www.majorschampionships.com/masters/2012/course/tour/index.cfm |archivedate=August 27, 2012 }}</ref>||colspan=2|'''Total'''||'''7,475'''||'''72'''\n|}\n\nLengths of the course for the Masters at the start of each decade:\n{|\n|\n* [[2010 Masters Tournament|2010]]: {{convert|7435|yd}}\n* [[2000 Masters Tournament|2000]]: {{convert|6985|yd}}\n* [[1990 Masters Tournament|1990]]: {{convert|6905|yd}}\n* [[1980 Masters Tournament|1980]]: {{convert|7040|yd|0}}\n|\n* [[1970 Masters Tournament|1970]]: {{convert|6980|yd|0}}\n* [[1960 Masters Tournament|1960]]: {{convert|6980|yd|0}}\n* [[1950 Masters Tournament|1950]]: {{convert|6900|yd|0}}\n* [[1940 Masters Tournament|1940]]: {{convert|6800|yd|0}}<ref name=itcpgat11/>\n|}\nThe course was lengthened to {{convert|7445|yd}} in [[2006 Masters Tournament|2006]].

Since [[1949 Masters Tournament|1949]], a green jacket has been awarded to the champion, who must return it to the clubhouse one year after his victory, although it remains his personal property and is stored with other champions' jackets in a specially designated cloakroom. In most instances, only a first-time and currently reigning champion may remove his jacket from the club grounds. A golfer who wins the event multiple times uses the same green jacket awarded upon his initial win (unless he needs to be re-fitted with a new jacket).<ref>{{cite web |first=Brent |last=Kelley |title=Do Masters Champions Get to Keep the Green Jacket? |url=http://golf.about.com/od/majorchampionships/f/keep_jacket.htm |publisher=About.com}}</ref> The Champions Dinner, inaugurated by [[Ben Hogan]] in [[1952 Masters Tournament|1952]], is held on the Tuesday before each tournament, and is open only to past champions and certain board members of the Augusta National Golf Club. Beginning in [[1963 Masters Tournament|1963]], legendary golfers, usually past champions, have hit an honorary tee shot on the morning of the first round to commence play. These have included [[Fred McLeod]], [[Jock Hutchinson]], [[Gene Sarazen]], [[Sam Snead]], [[Byron Nelson]], [[Arnold Palmer]], [[Jack Nicklaus]], and [[Gary Player]]. Since [[1960 Masters Tournament|1960]], a [[Masters Tournament Par-3 contest|semi-social contest]] at the par-3 course has been played on Wednesday, the day before the first round.\n\nNicklaus has the most Masters wins, with six between 1963 and 1986. [[Tiger Woods]] has won five. Palmer has won four. Five have won three titles at Augusta: [[Jimmy Demaret]], [[Sam Snead]], [[Gary Player]], [[Nick Faldo]], and [[Phil Mickelson]]. Player, from [[South Africa]], was the first non-American player to win the tournament, in [[1961 Masters Tournament|1961]]; the second was [[Seve Ballesteros]] of [[Spain]], the champion in [[1980 Masters Tournament|1980]] and [[1983 Masters Tournament|1983]].\n\nThe Augusta National course first opened {{Years or months ago|1933}} in 1933 and has been modified many times by different architects. Among the changes: greens have been reshaped and, on occasion, entirely re-designed, bunkers have been added, water hazards have been extended, new tee boxes have been built, hundreds of trees have been planted, and several mounds have been installed.<ref name=\"Owen 1999\">{{cite book |title=The Making of the Masters: Clifford Roberts, Augusta National, and Golf's Most Prestigious Tournament |first=David |last=Owen |publisher=Simon & Schuster |year=1999 |isbn=978-0-684-85729-9}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:AugustaNationalMastersLogoFlowers.jpg|thumb|<center>Masters logo<br>at the club entrance</center>]]\n\n===Augusta National Golf Club===\n{{main|Augusta National Golf Club}}\nThe idea for Augusta National originated with [[Bobby Jones (golfer)|Bobby Jones]], who wanted to build a golf course after his retirement from the game.

Argentine champion [[Roberto De Vicenzo]] signed his scorecard (attested by playing partner [[Tommy Aaron]]) incorrectly recording him as making a par 4 instead of a birdie 3 on the 17th hole of the final round. According to the rules of golf, if a player signs a scorecard (thereby attesting to its veracity) that records a score on a hole higher than what he actually made on the hole, the player receives the higher score for that hole. This extra stroke cost De Vicenzo a chance to be in an 18-hole Monday playoff with [[Bob Goalby]], who won the green jacket.

In his first appearance at Augusta in 1981, he led during the second nine but ended up finishing fourth. In 1986, after birdieing holes 14 through 17 to tie Nicklaus for the lead, he badly pushed his 4-iron approach on 18 into the patrons surrounding the green and missed his par putt for a closing bogey.  In 1987, Norman lost a sudden-death playoff when [[Larry Mize]] holed out a remarkable 45-yard pitch shot to birdie the second playoff hole.

After making his final putt to win, he broke down sobbing at the hole and was consoled and embraced by his caddie.  In the post-tournament interview, Crenshaw said: \"I had a 15th club in my bag,\" a reference to Penick. (The \"15th club\" reference is based on the golf rule that limits a player to carrying 14 clubs during a round.)  Crenshaw first won at Augusta in 1984.\n\nIn 1997, 21 year-old [[Tiger Woods]] became the youngest champion in Masters history, winning by 12 shots with an 18-under par 270 which broke the 72-hole record that had stood for 32 years.<ref name=\"Hist\"/> In 2001 Woods completed his \"Tiger Slam\" by winning his fourth straight major championship at the Masters by two shots over [[David Duval]]. <ref name=past-results/> He won again the following year, making him only the third player in history (after Nicklaus and Faldo) to win the tournament in consecutive years,<ref name=past-results/> as well as in 2005 when he defeated [[Chris DiMarco]] in a playoff for his first major championship win in almost three years.<ref name=past-results/>\n\nThe club was targeted by [[Martha Burk]], who organized a failed protest at the 2003 Masters to pressure the club into accepting female members.

The recipient of the green jacket has it presented to him inside the Butler Cabin soon after the end of the tournament in a televised ceremony, and the presentation is then repeated outside near the 18th green in front of the patrons. Winners keep their jacket for the year after their victory, then return it to the club to wear whenever they are present on the club grounds. [[Sam Snead]] was the first Masters champion to be awarded the green jacket after he took his first Masters title in 1949.\n\nThe green jacket is only allowed to be removed from the Augusta National grounds by the reigning champion, after which it must remain at the club.

The original honorary starters were [[Jock Hutchison]] and [[Fred McLeod]]; this twosome led off every tournament from 1963 until 1973, when poor health prevented Hutchison from swinging a club. McLeod continued on until his death in 1976. Byron Nelson and Gene Sarazen started in 1981, and were then joined by Sam Snead in 1984. This trio continued until 1999 when Sarazen died, while Nelson stopped in 2001. Snead hit his final opening tee shot in 2002, a little over a month before he died.\n\nIn 2007, Arnold Palmer took over as the honorary starter. Palmer also had the honor in 2008 and 2009.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.golftoday.co.uk/tours/2007/The_Masters/preview_2.html |title=Arnold Palmer to hit opening Masters tee shot |publisher=Golf Today |accessdate=February 4, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725112744/http://www.golftoday.co.uk/tours/2007/The_Masters/preview_2.html |archive-date=July 25, 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref> At the [[2010 Masters Tournament|2010]] and [[2011 Masters Tournament]]s, [[Jack Nicklaus]] joined Palmer as an honorary co-starter for the event.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/more_sports/2011/04/08/2011-04-08_arnold_palmer_jack_nicklaus_kick_off_2011_masters_as_honorary_starters_with_tee_.html |title=Arnold Palmer, Jack Nicklaus kick off 2011 Masters as honorary starters with tee shots at Augusta |first=Hank |last=Gola |newspaper=New York Daily News |accessdate=April 8, 2011 |date=April 8, 2011}}</ref> In 2012, [[Gary Player]] joined them.

Officially known as the \"Masters Club\", it includes only past winners of the Masters, although selected members of the Augusta National Golf Club have been included as honorary members, usually the chairman.\n\nThe defending champion, as host, selects the menu for the dinner. Frequently, Masters champions have served cuisine from their home regions prepared by the Masters chef. Notable examples have included [[haggis]], served by [[Scotland|Scotsman]] [[Sandy Lyle]] in 1989,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.masters.org/en_US/course/landmarks.html#dinner |title=Masters Club |publisher=www.masters.org |accessdate=January 25, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080109192302/http://www.masters.org/en_US/course/landmarks.html |archivedate=January 9, 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and [[bobotie]], a South African dish, served at the behest of 2008 champion [[Trevor Immelman]]. Other examples include German Bernhard Langer's 1986 Wiener schnitzel, Britain's Nick Faldo's fish and chips, Canadian Mike Weir's elk and wild boar, and Vijay Singh's seafood tom kah and chicken panang curry. In 1997, 1979 champion [[Fuzzy Zoeller]] created a media storm when he suggested that Tiger Woods refrain from serving collard greens and fried chicken, dishes commonly associated with Afro-American culture, at the dinner. The 2011 dinner of [[Phil Mickelson]] was a Spanish-themed menu in hopes that [[Seve Ballesteros]] would attend, but he was too sick to attend and died  weeks later.<ref>[http://www.golf.com/tour-news/2017/03/15/masters-champions-dinner-everything-you-need-know Masters Champions Dinner: Everything you need to know]</ref>\n\n===Caddies===\nUntil [[1983 Masters Tournament|1983]], all players in the Masters were required to use the services of an Augusta National Club [[caddie]],<ref name=trcdatag>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=WFcaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=yiQEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6177%2C1789683 |newspaper=Times-News |location=Hendersonville, North Carolina |title=Tour caddies at Augusta? |date=November 12, 1982 |page=14}}</ref><ref name=alctrbgd>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=3LUSAAAAIBAJ&sjid=mvkDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6774%2C1068214 |newspaper=Spokane Chronicle |location=Washington |last=Wade |first=Harless |title=Tradition bagged at Masters |date=April 6, 1983 |page=C1}}</ref><ref name=mcadcol>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=xMksAAAAIBAJ&sjid=chMEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6823%2C3348928 |newspaper=Sunday Star-News |location=Wilmington, North Carolina |last=Anderson |first=Dave |authorlink=Dave Anderson (sportswriter) |title=New Masters caddies collide |date=April 10, 1983 |page=6D}}</ref> who by club tradition was always an African American man.<ref name=\"nyt1990\"/> Indeed, club co-founder Clifford Roberts is reputed to have said, \"As long as I'm alive, golfers will be white, and caddies will be black.\"<ref>{{cite magazine |first=Rick |last=Reilly |authorlink=Rick Reilly |url=https://www.si.com/vault/1997/04/21/225867/strokes-of-genius-overpowering-a-storied-course-and-a-stellar-field-tiger-woods-heralded-a-new-era-in-golf-with-an-awesome-12-shot-victory-in-the-masters |title=Strokes of Genius |date=April 21, 1997 |accessdate=February 9, 2016 |magazine=Sports Illustrated}}</ref> Since 1983\u2014six years after Roberts's death in 1977\u2014players have been allowed the option of bringing their own caddie to the tournament.\n\nThe Masters requires caddies to wear a uniform consisting of a white jumpsuit, a green Masters cap, and white tennis shoes.

Since [[1948 Masters Tournament|1948]], its final round has been scheduled for the second Sunday of April, with several exceptions. It ended on the first Sunday four times ([[1952 Masters Tournament|1952]], [[1957 Masters Tournament|1957]], [[1958 Masters Tournament|1958]], [[1959 Masters Tournament|1959]]) and the [[1979 Masters Tournament|1979]] and [[1984 Masters Tournament|1984]] tournaments ended on April 15, the month's third Sunday.<ref name=\"Hist\"/> The first edition in [[1934 Masters Tournament|1934]] was held in late March and the next ten were in early April, with only the [[1942 Masters Tournament|1942]] event scheduled to end on the second Sunday.  The [[2020 Masters Tournament|2020]] event, postponed by the [[COVID-19]] pandemic, is slated to be held in the autumn, with it being the last major of the year.\n\nSimilar to the other majors, the tournament consists of four rounds at 18 holes each, Thursday through Sunday (when there are no delays). The Masters has a relatively small field of contenders, when compared with other golf tournaments, so the competitors play in groups of three for the first two rounds (36 holes) and the field is not split to start on the 1st and 10th tees, unless weather shortens the available playing time, such as the second round in 1983, fourth round in 2019, and is expected for all four rounds in 2020. The tournament is unique in that it is the only major tournament conducted by a private club rather than a national golf organization like the PGA.<ref name=\"Owen 1999\" />\n\nOriginally, the Masters was the only tournament to use two-man pairings during the first two rounds. It was also the only event to re-pair based on the leaderboard before Friday's round, as most tournaments only do this on the weekend. This practice ended in the early 2000s, when the Masters switched to the more standard three-man groups and the groups are now kept intact on Friday, with players sharing the same playing partners in both of the first two rounds.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nAfter 36 holes of play, a cut-off score is calculated to reduce the size of the field for the weekend rounds. To \"make the cut\", players must be either in the top 50 places (ties counting), or within 10 strokes of the leader's score. These criteria have applied since [[2013 Masters Tournament|2013]].<ref name=cut>{{cite news |url=http://espn.go.com/golf/masters13/story/_/id/9156060/fall-tour-event-winners-get-masters-spot |title=Masters tweaks qualifications |first=Bob |last=Harig |work=ESPN |date=April 10, 2013 |access-date=April 16, 2013}}</ref> From 1957 to 1960, the top 40 scores (including ties) and those within 10 strokes of the leader made the cut. From 1961 to 2012, it was the top 44 (and ties) or within 10 strokes of the lead.<ref name=cut/> Before [[1957 Masters Tournament|1957]], there was no 36-hole cut and all of the invitees played four rounds, if desired.<ref name=\"Cut\">{{cite web |url=http://www.masters.org/en_US/history/records/cutinfo.html |title=Cut Information |publisher=www.masters.org |access-date=January 21, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080119025225/http://www.masters.org/en_US/history/records/cutinfo.html |archivedate=January 19, 2008}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the cut, an additional 36 holes are played over the final two days. Should the fourth round fail to produce a winner, all players tied for the lead enter a [[Sudden death (sport)#Golf|sudden-death]] playoff. Play begins on the 18th hole, followed by the adjacent 10th, repeating until one player remains.

Earlier playoffs were 18 holes on the following day, except for the first in [[1935 Masters Tournament|1935]], which was 36 holes; the last 18-hole playoff was in [[1970 Masters Tournament|1970]], and none of the full-round playoffs went to additional holes.\n\n==Course==\nThe golf course was formerly a [[plant nursery]] and each hole is named after the tree or shrub with which it has become associated.<ref name=nursbeaut/><br>\nThe course layout in [[2019 Masters Tournament|2019]]:\n{|class=wikitable style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n!Hole!!Name!!Yards!!Par!! !!Hole!!Name!!Yards!!Par\n|-\n|1||align=left|[[Tea Olive]]||445||4||rowspan=10| ||10||align=left|[[Camellia]]||495||4\n|-\n|2||align=left|[[Flowering dogwood|Pink Dogwood]]||575||5||11||align=left|[[White Dogwood]]||505||4\n|-\n|3||align=left|[[Peach|Flowering Peach]]||350||4||12||align=left|[[Forsythia|Golden Bell]]||155||3\n|-\n|4||align=left|[[Malus|Flowering Crab Apple]]||240||3||13||align=left|[[Azalea]]||510||5\n|-\n|5||align=left|[[Southern magnolia|Magnolia]]||495||4||14||align=left|[[Cunninghamia|Chinese Fir]]||440||4\n|-\n|6||align=left|[[Eastern Juniper|Juniper]]||180||3||15||align=left|[[Pyracantha|Firethorn]]||530||5\n|-\n|7||align=left|[[Cortaderia selloana|Pampas]]||450||4||16||align=left|[[Eastern Redbud|Redbud]]||170||3\n|-\n|8||align=left|[[Yellow Jessamine|Yellow Jasmine]]||570||5||17||align=left|[[Nandina]]||440||4\n|-\n|9||align=left|[[Prunus caroliniana|Carolina Cherry]]||460||4||18||align=left|[[American holly|Holly]]||465||4\n|-\n| colspan=2|'''Out'''||'''3,765'''||'''36'''|| colspan=2|'''In'''||'''3,710'''||'''36'''\n|-\n| colspan=\"5\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|<small>Source:</small><ref name=itcpgat11/><ref name=2012cstour>{{cite web|url=http://www.majorschampionships.com/masters/2012/course/tour/index.cfm |publisher=PGA of America: Major Championships |title=Course Tour: 2012 Masters |accessdate=August 24, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120827230002/http://www.majorschampionships.com/masters/2012/course/tour/index.cfm |archivedate=August 27, 2012 }}</ref>||colspan=2|'''Total'''||'''7,475'''||'''72'''\n|}\n\nLengths of the course for the Masters at the start of each decade:\n{|\n|\n* [[2010 Masters Tournament|2010]]: {{convert|7435|yd}}\n* [[2000 Masters Tournament|2000]]: {{convert|6985|yd}}\n* [[1990 Masters Tournament|1990]]: {{convert|6905|yd}}\n* [[1980 Masters Tournament|1980]]: {{convert|7040|yd|0}}\n|\n* [[1970 Masters Tournament|1970]]: {{convert|6980|yd|0}}\n* [[1960 Masters Tournament|1960]]: {{convert|6980|yd|0}}\n* [[1950 Masters Tournament|1950]]: {{convert|6900|yd|0}}\n* [[1940 Masters Tournament|1940]]: {{convert|6800|yd|0}}<ref name=itcpgat11/>\n|}\nThe course was lengthened to {{convert|7445|yd}} in [[2006 Masters Tournament|2006]].

As of the [[2000 United States Census|2000 Census]], the First District contained 651,619 people. It consists largely of three small [[East Texas]] [[metropolitan area]]s&mdash;[[Lufkin, Texas|Lufkin]]-[[Nacogdoches]], [[Longview, Texas|Longview]]-[[Marshall, Texas|Marshall]], and [[Tyler, Texas|Tyler]].\n\nThe First District once encompassed large parts of [[North Texas]] and Central Texas, but as the population of Texas grew, the district got smaller until it only encompassed about half of [[Northeast Texas]]. \n\nFor most of its history, the district was based in [[Texarkana, Texas|Texarkana]], but in a controversial 2003 redistricting orchestrated by then-[[House Majority Leader]] [[Tom DeLay]], Texarkana was drawn out of the district and moved to the neighboring [[Texas's 4th congressional district|Fourth congressional district]]. Lufkin, Tyler and Longview were added in its place.\n\nThe district was predominantly rural for much of its history, and thus was far friendlier to electing [[United States Democratic Party|Democrats]] to Congress even as most of Texas swung toward the [[United States Republican Party|Republicans]]. The district's four-term Democratic incumbent, [[Max Sandlin]], was a particularly severe critic of the DeLay-led redistricting effort, claiming that lumping rural areas with urban ones stifled the voice of rural voters. Indeed, the 2003 redistricting made the district more urban and Republican, especially with the addition of the Republican strongholds of Tyler and Longview. Sandlin was heavily defeated in November 2004 by Republican [[Louie Gohmert]], a longtime judge in the Tyler area. Gohmert is the first Republican to represent the district since [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]]. Proving just how Republican the reconfigured 1st is, Gohmert has been reelected seven times with no less than 68 percent of the vote (and faced only token opposition in 2010 and 2012).\n\nThe district's best-known congressman, [[Wright Patman]], represented the district for 47 years \u2014 the second-longest tenure of any Texan in Congress. He was an early supporter of the [[New Deal]], and later chaired the House Banking Committee for 12 years.\n\n==2012 redistricting==\nThe 2012 redistricting process changed the district's northern section. All of [[Marion County, Texas|Marion County]], [[Cass County, Texas|Cass County]], and most of [[Upshur County, Texas|Upshur County]] were removed from the district. To compensate, the eastern half of [[Wood County, Texas|Wood County]] was added.<ref>http://gis1.tlc.state.tx.us/</ref>\n\n== Recent election results from statewide races == \n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n!

As of the [[2000 United States Census|2000 Census]], the First District contained 651,619 people. It consists largely of three small [[East Texas]] [[metropolitan area]]s&mdash;[[Lufkin, Texas|Lufkin]]-[[Nacogdoches]], [[Longview, Texas|Longview]]-[[Marshall, Texas|Marshall]], and [[Tyler, Texas|Tyler]].\n\nThe First District once encompassed large parts of [[North Texas]] and Central Texas, but as the population of Texas grew, the district got smaller until it only encompassed about half of [[Northeast Texas]]. \n\nFor most of its history, the district was based in [[Texarkana, Texas|Texarkana]], but in a controversial 2003 redistricting orchestrated by then-[[House Majority Leader]] [[Tom DeLay]], Texarkana was drawn out of the district and moved to the neighboring [[Texas's 4th congressional district|Fourth congressional district]]. Lufkin, Tyler and Longview were added in its place.\n\nThe district was predominantly rural for much of its history, and thus was far friendlier to electing [[United States Democratic Party|Democrats]] to Congress even as most of Texas swung toward the [[United States Republican Party|Republicans]]. The district's four-term Democratic incumbent, [[Max Sandlin]], was a particularly severe critic of the DeLay-led redistricting effort, claiming that lumping rural areas with urban ones stifled the voice of rural voters. Indeed, the 2003 redistricting made the district more urban and Republican, especially with the addition of the Republican strongholds of Tyler and Longview. Sandlin was heavily defeated in November 2004 by Republican [[Louie Gohmert]], a longtime judge in the Tyler area. Gohmert is the first Republican to represent the district since [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]]. Proving just how Republican the reconfigured 1st is, Gohmert has been reelected seven times with no less than 68 percent of the vote (and faced only token opposition in 2010 and 2012).\n\nThe district's best-known congressman, [[Wright Patman]], represented the district for 47 years \u2014 the second-longest tenure of any Texan in Congress.

Originally serialized in ''[[Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump]]'' from 1987 to 2004, it was transferred to the monthly [[seinen|''seinen'' manga]] magazine ''[[Ultra Jump]]'' in 2005. The plot of the series is divided into eight story arcs, each following the adventures of a new protagonist bearing the \"JoJo\" nickname; the eighth part, ''[[JoJolion]]'', began serialization in May 2011. The series is currently [[Shueisha]]'s second [[List of manga series by volume count|largest manga series by volume count]], with its chapters collected in 126 ''[[tank\u014dbon]]'' volumes as of December 2019.\n\nA [[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure (1993 anime series)|13-episode original video animation series]] adapting the manga's third part, ''[[Stardust Crusaders]]'', was produced by [[A.P.P.P.]] and released between 1993 and 2002.{{efn|Seven episodes adapting the latter half of the part were released between 1993 and 1994; six more episodes adapting the first half were released between 2000 and 2002.}} The studio later produced [[Phantom Blood#Release and related media|an anime film]] adaptation of the first part in the series, ''[[Phantom Blood]]'', which was released in Japanese theaters in 2007. In October 2012, an [[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure (2012 TV series)|anime television series adaptation]] produced by [[David Production]] began broadcast on [[Tokyo MX]]. The studio has since adapted through the series' fifth part, ''[[Golden Wind (manga)|Golden Wind]]'', which ended broadcast in July 2019. A [[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Diamond Is Unbreakable Chapter I|live-action film]] directed by [[Takashi Miike]] and based on the fourth part, ''[[Diamond is Unbreakable]]'', entered theaters in 2017.\n\n''JoJo's Bizarre Adventure'' is famous for its iconic art style and poses, frequent references to Western [[popular music]] and [[fashion]], and creative battles centered around [[#Supernatural powers|Stands]], psycho-spiritual manifestations possessing unique supernatural abilities. The series has sold over 100 million copies in print to date, making it one of the [[List of best-selling manga|best-selling manga series]] in history, and it has spawned a [[media franchise]] including [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot manga]], spin-off [[light novel]]s, [[List of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure video games|video games]], [[model figure|action figures]], and lines of apparel. The manga, TV anime, and live-action film are licensed in North America by [[Viz Media]], which has produced various English-language releases of the series since 2005.\n\n==Plot==\n{{See also|List of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure characters}}\nEach of the series' eight protagonists is a member of the {{Nihongo|Joestar family|\u30b8\u30e7\u30fc\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u5bb6|J\u014dsut\u0101 ke}}, whose mainline descendants invariably possess a star-shaped birthmark above their left shoulder blade and a name that can be abbreviated to the titular \"JoJo\". The plot of each part generally consists of this JoJo gathering a group of allies, mastering their supernatural ability, battling various enemies, and ultimately confronting the part's powerful main villain. The first six parts of the series take place within a single continuity whose multi-generational conflict stems from the rivalry between [[Jonathan Joestar]] and [[Dio Brando]], while the latter two parts take place in an alternate universe following a continuity reboot, where the Joestar family tree is heavily altered.\n\n; Part 1<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Phantom Blood]]''|\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u30c8\u30e0\u30d6\u30e9\u30c3\u30c9|Fantomu Buraddo}}\n:Volumes 1\u20135, 44 chapters. In late 19th-century [[England]], the young Jonathan Joestar meets his new adopted brother [[Dio Brando]], who only wants to usurp Jonathan as heir to the Joestar family. However, his attempts are thwarted and he resorts to using an ancient Stone Mask which transforms him into a vampire. Jonathan, with Italian [[#Supernatural powers|Hamon]] master Will A. Zeppeli and former street thug Robert E.O. Speedwagon at his side, uses his newly found affinity for Hamon to stop Dio whose sights are set on nothing less than world domination. With this Hamon, Jonathan has discovered the only power that can kill a Vampire, and thus is especially necessary in his rivalry against Dio, who has tormented him his whole life.\n\n; Part 2<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Battle Tendency]]''|\u6226\u95d8\u6f6e\u6d41|Sent\u014d Ch\u014dry\u016b}}\n:Volumes 5\u201312, 69 chapters. In [[New York City]] in 1938, Joseph Joestar, grandson of Jonathan, has a natural affinity for Hamon. After hearing of Speedwagon's supposed death during an excavation, Joseph decides to investigate and becomes entangled with the revival of the Pillar Men, ancient humanoids of impossible power who are tied to the creation of the Stone Mask. Joseph ultimately teams up with Caesar Zeppeli, Will's grandson, and Caesar's teacher Lisa Lisa, who is mysteriously tied to Joseph. Under the pressure of poisons implanted in Joseph's body, Joseph must master Hamon as they try to stop the Pillar Men from obtaining the Red Stone of Aja, a mystical artifact in Lisa Lisa's possession that will grant them immortality and bring about the end of the world at their hands.\n\n; Part 3<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Stardust Crusaders]]''|\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30c0\u30b9\u30c8\u30af\u30eb\u30bb\u30a4\u30c0\u30fc\u30b9|Sut\u0101dasuto Kuruseid\u0101su}}\n:Volumes 13\u201328, 152 chapters. In 1989, Jotaro Kujo, a Japanese high school student, places himself in jail because he believes he is possessed by an evil spirit. His mother Holly calls on her father Joseph Joestar to talk sense into Jotaro. With the help of his ally the Egyptian fortune teller Mohammed Avdol, Joseph reveals that Jotaro has in fact developed a supernatural ability known as a [[#Supernatural powers|Stand]] that has run through the family due to a newly resurfaced Dio Brando having fused his head to Jonathan Joestar's headless body. After thwarting an assassination attempt by transfer student Noriaki Kakyoin, who is under Dio's thrall, Jotaro and Joseph discover that Holly is dying from her own Stand. Jotaro resolves to hunt down Dio, and Joseph leads him, Avdol, and Kakyoin to Egypt, using their Stands to battle more Stand-wielding assassins along the way before 50 days elapse and Holly dies. As they progress, they gain allies in the French swordsman Jean Pierre Polnareff, who wishes to avenge the death of his sister, and the [[Boston Terrier]] Iggy, who begrudgingly accompanies the group on the way to Cairo to bring about the demise of Dio that was due one hundred years prior.\n\n; Part 4<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Diamond Is Unbreakable]]''|\u30c0\u30a4\u30e4\u30e2\u30f3\u30c9\u306f\u7815\u3051\u306a\u3044|Daiyamondo wa Kudakenai}}\n:Volumes 29\u201347, 174 chapters. In the fictional Japanese town of Morioh in 1999, Jotaro arrives to tell Josuke Higashikata (the kanji {{lang|ja|\u52a9}} in his name is read in the ''[[on'yomi]]'' form as ''jo'') that he is the illegitimate son of Joseph Joestar and to warn him that Morioh is becoming filled with Stand users. This is due to a mystical Bow and Arrow that bestows Stands on those struck by the arrowheads. After Josuke takes revenge on a Stand user who killed his grandfather, he agrees to help Jotaro hunt down the holder of the Bow and Arrow. He gains allies in Josuke's friend Koichi Hirose, who is hit by the arrow; Okuyasu Nijimura, whose brother Keicho was using the Arrow until it was stolen from him; Rohan Kishibe, a famous manga artist; and even his estranged father Joseph Joestar. Along the way, the group deals with the various new Stand users throughout Morioh, including several of Josuke, Koichi, and Okuyasu's classmates. Eventually, the death of one of their friends leads to the discovery that one of the new Stand users is the serial killer, Yoshikage Kira.\n\n; Part 5<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Golden Wind (manga)|Golden Wind]]''|\u9ec4\u91d1\u306e\u98a8|\u014cgon no Kaze}}\n:Volumes 47\u201363, 155 chapters. In 2001, Koichi Hirose is sent by Jotaro to [[Naples]] to investigate Giorno Giovanna, whom Jotaro has discovered is Dio's son fathered via Jonathan's body before his defeat in Cairo 12 years earlier, to see if the boy has a Stand and if he is evil. Koichi ultimately discovers Giorno's Stand and his pure goals for reforming a mafia organization from the inside out, and Jotaro lets him live his life uninterrupted. Giorno ultimately joins Bruno Bucciarati's squad within Passione, a Stand-using mafia, who leads Giorno, Leone Abbacchio, Guido Mista, Narancia Ghirga, and Pannacotta Fugo on a mission to [[Capri]] to retrieve Bruno's former superior's riches. In addition to being attacked by rival mafioso along the way, they are then tasked by Passione's boss to escort his daughter Trish Una throughout Italy and protect her from others in the gang who wish to use her to find out the boss's identity.\n\n; Part 6<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Stone Ocean]]''|\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30f3\u30aa\u30fc\u30b7\u30e3\u30f3|Sut\u014dn \u014cshan}}\n:Volumes 64\u201380, 158 chapters. In 2011 near [[Port St. Lucie, Florida]], Jolyne Cujoh is arrested and sent to the Green Dolphin St. Prison for murder. Her estranged father Jotaro visits her and reveals that she has been set up in order for one of Dio's disciples to kill her within the prison. After revealing that a gift he gave her has awoken her latent Stand powers to protect her, Jotaro is attacked, and his Stand and memories are stolen from him by the prison chaplain Enrico Pucci, Dio's disciple. Jolyne works with fellow inmate Ermes Costello, who has also had a Stand awoken in her, to retrieve her father's Stand, gaining allies in the boy Emporio Alni\u00f1o; fellow inmates Narciso Anasui and Weather Report; and the sentient Stand-using plankton colony \u201cFoo Fighters\u201d to save her father and stop Pucci before he can use his Stand to recreate the universe in Dio's image.\n\n; Part 7<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Steel Ball Run]]''|\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30fc\u30eb\u30fb\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb\u30fb\u30e9\u30f3|Sut\u012bru B\u014dru Ran}}\n:Volumes 81\u2013104, 95 chapters. In an alternate timeline in 1890, Gyro Zeppeli travels to the United States to take part in a cross-country horse race known as the Steel Ball Run. His skill in a mystical martial art known as Spin, which he controls with steel balls, garners the interest of former jockey turned paraplegic Johnny Joestar, particularly after a Spin-infused ball briefly restores Johnny's ability to walk. Johnny travels with Gyro on the race to learn the art of Spin from him in hopes he can walk again, but they soon discover that the race is a ploy set up by Funny Valentine, the President of the United States, to search the country for the scattered parts of a holy corpse that imbue their holders with a Stand, so the President can use the entire corpse to his own patriotic ends, even if it means the disruption of other dimensions with his Stand's ability. Gyro and Johnny work together, along with fellow racers Mountain Tim and Hot Pants, and race organizer Stephen Steel and his wife Lucy, to stop the President from achieving his plans, as they threaten the very world, all while dealing with Valentine's hired assassins in the race, including the charismatic racer Diego Brando.\n\n; Part 8<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[JoJolion]]''|\u30b8\u30e7\u30b8\u30e7\u30ea\u30aa\u30f3|Jojorion}}\n:Volumes 105\u2013126, 93 chapters. In 2012, in the same universe as ''Steel Ball Run'', the town of Morioh has been devastated by the [[2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami]], which has caused mysterious faults colloquially known as the \"Wall Eyes\" to appear in town. Local college student Yasuho Hirose is near one of the Wall Eyes when she discovers a young man buried in the rubble and a strange bite mark on him. She nicknames him \"Josuke\", as he cannot remember his own name, and after following a lead that he may be \"Yoshikage Kira\", an attack by a Stand user leads them to find the real Yoshikage Kira's corpse. Josuke is put in the care of the Higashikata family, whose patriarch Norisuke IV seems to know more about Josuke than he initially lets on, but Josuke himself discovers that the Higashikata family and Yoshikage Kira's family are linked due to Johnny Joestar's marriage to Rina Higashikata in the late 19th century. Josuke and Yasuho ultimately discover that Josuke is in fact Yoshikage Kira, mysteriously fused with another person, and Yoshikage Kira possessed the knowledge to cure a curse that has plagued the Higashikata family for centuries. Norisuke IV wants that knowledge back to save his grandchild from the same fate he and his family has suffered, but a mysterious race of rock men and Norisuke IV's own son Jobin seem to be conspiring against them to both prevent Josuke from regaining his memories and from lifting the curse on the Higashikata family.\n\n==Supernatural powers==\n{{more citations needed section|date=May 2017}}\n* {{anchor|Hamon}} '''Part 1:''' ''[[Phantom Blood]]'' introduces the {{nihongo|Stone Mask|\u77f3\u4eee\u9762|Ishikamen}}, an artifact discovered in Aztec ruins that reacts when blood is spilled on it, the Stone Mask produces spikes that drive themselves into the wearer's skull, transforming them into an immortal {{nihongo|[[Vampire]]|\u5438\u8840\u9b3c|Ky\u016bketsuki}}. These Vampires drain people of blood, can heal from most injuries, combine other creatures into abominations and freeze objects. A Vampire can only be killed by destroying the head, or by exposure to natural sunlight or ultraviolet rays. The {{nihongo|Ripple|\u6ce2\u7d0b|Hamon}} is also introduced as a martial arts technique that allows the user to focus bodily energy via controlled breathing. It is effective in combating vampires, as experienced Ripple users can emulate sunlight. Such energy is also useful in combating {{nihongo|Zombies|{{ruby-ja|\u5c4d\u751f\u4eba|\u30be\u30f3\u30d3}}|Zonbi|also referred to as {{nihongo|\"Undead\"|{{ruby-ja|\u4ea1\u8005|\u30a2\u30f3\u30c7\u30c3\u30c9}}|Andeddo}}}} created by vampires.\n* '''Part 2:''' ''[[Battle Tendency]]'' introduces the {{nihongo|Pillar Men|\u67f1\u306e\u7537|Hashira no Otoko}}, ancient humanoids whose superhuman abilities enabled them to thrive as apex predators. One of their members, Kars, created the Stone Masks in an attempt to find a way to bypass their species' weakness to sunlight so they may rule Earth. When they are exposed to sunlight, they turn to stone, thus making them susceptible to the energies of the Ripple. Their surviving members seek out the {{nihongo|Red Stone of Aja|\u30a8\u30a4\u30b8\u30e3\u306e\u8d64\u77f3|Eija no Sekiseki}}, a flawless gem that amplifies light into nearly laser precision which is able to perfect the transformation into an immortal being with control over all life's forces. It is for this reason that the Ripple users protect the flawless Super Aja so it will not fall into the hands of the Pillar Men.\n* {{anchor|Stands}} '''Part 3:''' ''[[Stardust Crusaders]]'' introduces an evolution of the Ripple concept, {{nihongo|Stands|{{ruby-ja|\u5e7d\u6ce2\u7d0b|\u3086\u3046\u306f\u3082\u3093}}|Y\u016bhamon|literally \"Ghost (or Spirit) Ripple\", pronounced in the series as the English {{nihongo|\"Stand\"|\u30b9\u30bf\u30f3\u30c9|Sutando}}}}, so named because they are the manifestation of the user's psychic powers, or what would be their Ripple, in the form of a spiritual familiar that stands with them. A person may obtain a Stand naturally at birth, through rigorous spiritual and/or Ripple training, through exceptionally strong willpower, desire and/or passion, or through inheritance from bloodline. A Stand may never manifest itself until it is amplified by certain conditions or factors and not everyone has the ability to control it. Some Stands appear to have a separate and autonomous personality from their users, able to act on their own to protect them or speak to them. Generally, if the Stand user is incapacitated, the Stand will no longer be a threat (with an exception in Part 5), and any damage to a stand will be reflected on its user, and vice versa.\n* '''Part 4:''' ''[[Diamond Is Unbreakable]]'' introduces a {{nihongo|Bow and Arrow|\u5f13\u3068\u77e2|Yumi to Ya}}, forged from a mysterious meteorite that made its way to Earth after being drawn in by the spiritual powers of the planet's inhabitants. A Stand can be brought forth after one is pierced by the Arrow; however, the results can be unpredictable, as it could easily kill an unqualified person, and there is no apparent way to know if a person is qualified ahead of time. The Arrows do, however, tend to seek out qualified people on their own if there is someone to guide them.\n* '''Part 5:''' ''[[Golden Wind (manga)|Golden Wind]]'' introduces the ability to create a {{nihongo|\"Requiem\"|{{ruby-ja|\u93ae\u9b42\u6b4c|\u30ec\u30af\u30a4\u30a8\u30e0}}|Rekuiemu}} Stand. If an Arrow hits the Stand instead of the user, the Stand can completely change form and its powers become a Requiem Stand with increased powers that relate to the control over the souls of living beings. Both Giorno's Gold Experience and Polnareff's Silver Chariot are pierced by the Arrow and given Requiem forms. Silver Chariot Requiem's new ability swaps the souls of all living beings, and Gold Experience Requiem's new ability removes the consequences of any action, reverting it to a null state.\n* '''Part 6:''' ''[[Stone Ocean]]'' shows examples of a single person possessing two Stands because of the ability of an extraordinary Stand. Enrico Pucci is able to produce artificial Stand users by stealing others' Stands, transforming them into {{nihongo|Discs|\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30af|Disuku}}, and \"inserting\" them into certain individuals. Part 6 also features {{nihongo|DIO's bone|{{ruby-ja|DIO|\u30c7\u30a3\u30aa}}\u306e\u9aa8|DIO no Hone}}, the sole remaining part of DIO which is instrumental in Pucci's {{nihongo|Way to Heaven|\u5929\u56fd\u3078\u884c\u304f\u65b9\u6cd5|Tengoku e Iku H\u014dh\u014d}}.

Also introduced in Part 7 is the {{nihongo|Saint's Corpse|\u8056\u4eba\u306e\u907a\u4f53|Seijin no Itai}}, body parts of a deceased holy man (hinted to be [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]]) that imbue the user with a Stand if the body part is fused with the user. If the user loses the Corpse part, they lose their Stand.\n* '''Part 8:''' ''[[JoJolion]]'' introduces another method of obtaining a Stand, interaction with the {{nihongo|Wall Eyes|\u58c1\u306e\u76ee|Kabe no Me}}, strange [[fault (geology)|fault]]-like structures that have risen from the ground following the [[2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami]]. They disrupt all forms of transportation, communication, and utilities, but all users of Stands have come in contact with the Wall Eyes at some point. A race of Stand-using {{nihongo|Rock People|\u5ca9\u4eba\u9593|Iwa Ningen}} also appears in ''JoJolion''. These humans seem to innately possess the ability to turn their body into stone and enter a state of suspended animation.

Originally serialized in ''[[Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump]]'' from 1987 to 2004, it was transferred to the monthly [[seinen|''seinen'' manga]] magazine ''[[Ultra Jump]]'' in 2005. The plot of the series is divided into eight story arcs, each following the adventures of a new protagonist bearing the \"JoJo\" nickname; the eighth part, ''[[JoJolion]]'', began serialization in May 2011. The series is currently [[Shueisha]]'s second [[List of manga series by volume count|largest manga series by volume count]], with its chapters collected in 126 ''[[tank\u014dbon]]'' volumes as of December 2019.\n\nA [[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure (1993 anime series)|13-episode original video animation series]] adapting the manga's third part, ''[[Stardust Crusaders]]'', was produced by [[A.P.P.P.]] and released between 1993 and 2002.{{efn|Seven episodes adapting the latter half of the part were released between 1993 and 1994; six more episodes adapting the first half were released between 2000 and 2002.}} The studio later produced [[Phantom Blood#Release and related media|an anime film]] adaptation of the first part in the series, ''[[Phantom Blood]]'', which was released in Japanese theaters in 2007. In October 2012, an [[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure (2012 TV series)|anime television series adaptation]] produced by [[David Production]] began broadcast on [[Tokyo MX]]. The studio has since adapted through the series' fifth part, ''[[Golden Wind (manga)|Golden Wind]]'', which ended broadcast in July 2019. A [[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Diamond Is Unbreakable Chapter I|live-action film]] directed by [[Takashi Miike]] and based on the fourth part, ''[[Diamond is Unbreakable]]'', entered theaters in 2017.\n\n''JoJo's Bizarre Adventure'' is famous for its iconic art style and poses, frequent references to Western [[popular music]] and [[fashion]], and creative battles centered around [[#Supernatural powers|Stands]], psycho-spiritual manifestations possessing unique supernatural abilities. The series has sold over 100 million copies in print to date, making it one of the [[List of best-selling manga|best-selling manga series]] in history, and it has spawned a [[media franchise]] including [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot manga]], spin-off [[light novel]]s, [[List of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure video games|video games]], [[model figure|action figures]], and lines of apparel. The manga, TV anime, and live-action film are licensed in North America by [[Viz Media]], which has produced various English-language releases of the series since 2005.\n\n==Plot==\n{{See also|List of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure characters}}\nEach of the series' eight protagonists is a member of the {{Nihongo|Joestar family|\u30b8\u30e7\u30fc\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u5bb6|J\u014dsut\u0101 ke}}, whose mainline descendants invariably possess a star-shaped birthmark above their left shoulder blade and a name that can be abbreviated to the titular \"JoJo\". The plot of each part generally consists of this JoJo gathering a group of allies, mastering their supernatural ability, battling various enemies, and ultimately confronting the part's powerful main villain. The first six parts of the series take place within a single continuity whose multi-generational conflict stems from the rivalry between [[Jonathan Joestar]] and [[Dio Brando]], while the latter two parts take place in an alternate universe following a continuity reboot, where the Joestar family tree is heavily altered.\n\n; Part 1<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Phantom Blood]]''|\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u30c8\u30e0\u30d6\u30e9\u30c3\u30c9|Fantomu Buraddo}}\n:Volumes 1\u20135, 44 chapters. In late 19th-century [[England]], the young Jonathan Joestar meets his new adopted brother [[Dio Brando]], who only wants to usurp Jonathan as heir to the Joestar family. However, his attempts are thwarted and he resorts to using an ancient Stone Mask which transforms him into a vampire. Jonathan, with Italian [[#Supernatural powers|Hamon]] master Will A. Zeppeli and former street thug Robert E.O. Speedwagon at his side, uses his newly found affinity for Hamon to stop Dio whose sights are set on nothing less than world domination. With this Hamon, Jonathan has discovered the only power that can kill a Vampire, and thus is especially necessary in his rivalry against Dio, who has tormented him his whole life.\n\n; Part 2<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Battle Tendency]]''|\u6226\u95d8\u6f6e\u6d41|Sent\u014d Ch\u014dry\u016b}}\n:Volumes 5\u201312, 69 chapters. In [[New York City]] in 1938, Joseph Joestar, grandson of Jonathan, has a natural affinity for Hamon. After hearing of Speedwagon's supposed death during an excavation, Joseph decides to investigate and becomes entangled with the revival of the Pillar Men, ancient humanoids of impossible power who are tied to the creation of the Stone Mask. Joseph ultimately teams up with Caesar Zeppeli, Will's grandson, and Caesar's teacher Lisa Lisa, who is mysteriously tied to Joseph. Under the pressure of poisons implanted in Joseph's body, Joseph must master Hamon as they try to stop the Pillar Men from obtaining the Red Stone of Aja, a mystical artifact in Lisa Lisa's possession that will grant them immortality and bring about the end of the world at their hands.\n\n; Part 3<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Stardust Crusaders]]''|\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30c0\u30b9\u30c8\u30af\u30eb\u30bb\u30a4\u30c0\u30fc\u30b9|Sut\u0101dasuto Kuruseid\u0101su}}\n:Volumes 13\u201328, 152 chapters. In 1989, Jotaro Kujo, a Japanese high school student, places himself in jail because he believes he is possessed by an evil spirit. His mother Holly calls on her father Joseph Joestar to talk sense into Jotaro. With the help of his ally the Egyptian fortune teller Mohammed Avdol, Joseph reveals that Jotaro has in fact developed a supernatural ability known as a [[#Supernatural powers|Stand]] that has run through the family due to a newly resurfaced Dio Brando having fused his head to Jonathan Joestar's headless body. After thwarting an assassination attempt by transfer student Noriaki Kakyoin, who is under Dio's thrall, Jotaro and Joseph discover that Holly is dying from her own Stand. Jotaro resolves to hunt down Dio, and Joseph leads him, Avdol, and Kakyoin to Egypt, using their Stands to battle more Stand-wielding assassins along the way before 50 days elapse and Holly dies. As they progress, they gain allies in the French swordsman Jean Pierre Polnareff, who wishes to avenge the death of his sister, and the [[Boston Terrier]] Iggy, who begrudgingly accompanies the group on the way to Cairo to bring about the demise of Dio that was due one hundred years prior.\n\n; Part 4<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Diamond Is Unbreakable]]''|\u30c0\u30a4\u30e4\u30e2\u30f3\u30c9\u306f\u7815\u3051\u306a\u3044|Daiyamondo wa Kudakenai}}\n:Volumes 29\u201347, 174 chapters. In the fictional Japanese town of Morioh in 1999, Jotaro arrives to tell Josuke Higashikata (the kanji {{lang|ja|\u52a9}} in his name is read in the ''[[on'yomi]]'' form as ''jo'') that he is the illegitimate son of Joseph Joestar and to warn him that Morioh is becoming filled with Stand users. This is due to a mystical Bow and Arrow that bestows Stands on those struck by the arrowheads. After Josuke takes revenge on a Stand user who killed his grandfather, he agrees to help Jotaro hunt down the holder of the Bow and Arrow. He gains allies in Josuke's friend Koichi Hirose, who is hit by the arrow; Okuyasu Nijimura, whose brother Keicho was using the Arrow until it was stolen from him; Rohan Kishibe, a famous manga artist; and even his estranged father Joseph Joestar. Along the way, the group deals with the various new Stand users throughout Morioh, including several of Josuke, Koichi, and Okuyasu's classmates. Eventually, the death of one of their friends leads to the discovery that one of the new Stand users is the serial killer, Yoshikage Kira.\n\n; Part 5<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Golden Wind (manga)|Golden Wind]]''|\u9ec4\u91d1\u306e\u98a8|\u014cgon no Kaze}}\n:Volumes 47\u201363, 155 chapters. In 2001, Koichi Hirose is sent by Jotaro to [[Naples]] to investigate Giorno Giovanna, whom Jotaro has discovered is Dio's son fathered via Jonathan's body before his defeat in Cairo 12 years earlier, to see if the boy has a Stand and if he is evil. Koichi ultimately discovers Giorno's Stand and his pure goals for reforming a mafia organization from the inside out, and Jotaro lets him live his life uninterrupted. Giorno ultimately joins Bruno Bucciarati's squad within Passione, a Stand-using mafia, who leads Giorno, Leone Abbacchio, Guido Mista, Narancia Ghirga, and Pannacotta Fugo on a mission to [[Capri]] to retrieve Bruno's former superior's riches. In addition to being attacked by rival mafioso along the way, they are then tasked by Passione's boss to escort his daughter Trish Una throughout Italy and protect her from others in the gang who wish to use her to find out the boss's identity.\n\n; Part 6<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Stone Ocean]]''|\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30f3\u30aa\u30fc\u30b7\u30e3\u30f3|Sut\u014dn \u014cshan}}\n:Volumes 64\u201380, 158 chapters.

Her estranged father Jotaro visits her and reveals that she has been set up in order for one of Dio's disciples to kill her within the prison. After revealing that a gift he gave her has awoken her latent Stand powers to protect her, Jotaro is attacked, and his Stand and memories are stolen from him by the prison chaplain Enrico Pucci, Dio's disciple. Jolyne works with fellow inmate Ermes Costello, who has also had a Stand awoken in her, to retrieve her father's Stand, gaining allies in the boy Emporio Alni\u00f1o; fellow inmates Narciso Anasui and Weather Report; and the sentient Stand-using plankton colony \u201cFoo Fighters\u201d to save her father and stop Pucci before he can use his Stand to recreate the universe in Dio's image.\n\n; Part 7<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Steel Ball Run]]''|\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30fc\u30eb\u30fb\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb\u30fb\u30e9\u30f3|Sut\u012bru B\u014dru Ran}}\n:Volumes 81\u2013104, 95 chapters. In an alternate timeline in 1890, Gyro Zeppeli travels to the United States to take part in a cross-country horse race known as the Steel Ball Run. His skill in a mystical martial art known as Spin, which he controls with steel balls, garners the interest of former jockey turned paraplegic Johnny Joestar, particularly after a Spin-infused ball briefly restores Johnny's ability to walk. Johnny travels with Gyro on the race to learn the art of Spin from him in hopes he can walk again, but they soon discover that the race is a ploy set up by Funny Valentine, the President of the United States, to search the country for the scattered parts of a holy corpse that imbue their holders with a Stand, so the President can use the entire corpse to his own patriotic ends, even if it means the disruption of other dimensions with his Stand's ability. Gyro and Johnny work together, along with fellow racers Mountain Tim and Hot Pants, and race organizer Stephen Steel and his wife Lucy, to stop the President from achieving his plans, as they threaten the very world, all while dealing with Valentine's hired assassins in the race, including the charismatic racer Diego Brando.\n\n; Part 8<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[JoJolion]]''|\u30b8\u30e7\u30b8\u30e7\u30ea\u30aa\u30f3|Jojorion}}\n:Volumes 105\u2013126, 93 chapters. In 2012, in the same universe as ''Steel Ball Run'', the town of Morioh has been devastated by the [[2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami]], which has caused mysterious faults colloquially known as the \"Wall Eyes\" to appear in town. Local college student Yasuho Hirose is near one of the Wall Eyes when she discovers a young man buried in the rubble and a strange bite mark on him. She nicknames him \"Josuke\", as he cannot remember his own name, and after following a lead that he may be \"Yoshikage Kira\", an attack by a Stand user leads them to find the real Yoshikage Kira's corpse. Josuke is put in the care of the Higashikata family, whose patriarch Norisuke IV seems to know more about Josuke than he initially lets on, but Josuke himself discovers that the Higashikata family and Yoshikage Kira's family are linked due to Johnny Joestar's marriage to Rina Higashikata in the late 19th century. Josuke and Yasuho ultimately discover that Josuke is in fact Yoshikage Kira, mysteriously fused with another person, and Yoshikage Kira possessed the knowledge to cure a curse that has plagued the Higashikata family for centuries. Norisuke IV wants that knowledge back to save his grandchild from the same fate he and his family has suffered, but a mysterious race of rock men and Norisuke IV's own son Jobin seem to be conspiring against them to both prevent Josuke from regaining his memories and from lifting the curse on the Higashikata family.\n\n==Supernatural powers==\n{{more citations needed section|date=May 2017}}\n* {{anchor|Hamon}} '''Part 1:''' ''[[Phantom Blood]]'' introduces the {{nihongo|Stone Mask|\u77f3\u4eee\u9762|Ishikamen}}, an artifact discovered in Aztec ruins that reacts when blood is spilled on it, the Stone Mask produces spikes that drive themselves into the wearer's skull, transforming them into an immortal {{nihongo|[[Vampire]]|\u5438\u8840\u9b3c|Ky\u016bketsuki}}. These Vampires drain people of blood, can heal from most injuries, combine other creatures into abominations and freeze objects. A Vampire can only be killed by destroying the head, or by exposure to natural sunlight or ultraviolet rays. The {{nihongo|Ripple|\u6ce2\u7d0b|Hamon}} is also introduced as a martial arts technique that allows the user to focus bodily energy via controlled breathing. It is effective in combating vampires, as experienced Ripple users can emulate sunlight. Such energy is also useful in combating {{nihongo|Zombies|{{ruby-ja|\u5c4d\u751f\u4eba|\u30be\u30f3\u30d3}}|Zonbi|also referred to as {{nihongo|\"Undead\"|{{ruby-ja|\u4ea1\u8005|\u30a2\u30f3\u30c7\u30c3\u30c9}}|Andeddo}}}} created by vampires.\n* '''Part 2:''' ''[[Battle Tendency]]'' introduces the {{nihongo|Pillar Men|\u67f1\u306e\u7537|Hashira no Otoko}}, ancient humanoids whose superhuman abilities enabled them to thrive as apex predators. One of their members, Kars, created the Stone Masks in an attempt to find a way to bypass their species' weakness to sunlight so they may rule Earth. When they are exposed to sunlight, they turn to stone, thus making them susceptible to the energies of the Ripple. Their surviving members seek out the {{nihongo|Red Stone of Aja|\u30a8\u30a4\u30b8\u30e3\u306e\u8d64\u77f3|Eija no Sekiseki}}, a flawless gem that amplifies light into nearly laser precision which is able to perfect the transformation into an immortal being with control over all life's forces. It is for this reason that the Ripple users protect the flawless Super Aja so it will not fall into the hands of the Pillar Men.\n* {{anchor|Stands}} '''Part 3:''' ''[[Stardust Crusaders]]'' introduces an evolution of the Ripple concept, {{nihongo|Stands|{{ruby-ja|\u5e7d\u6ce2\u7d0b|\u3086\u3046\u306f\u3082\u3093}}|Y\u016bhamon|literally \"Ghost (or Spirit) Ripple\", pronounced in the series as the English {{nihongo|\"Stand\"|\u30b9\u30bf\u30f3\u30c9|Sutando}}}}, so named because they are the manifestation of the user's psychic powers, or what would be their Ripple, in the form of a spiritual familiar that stands with them. A person may obtain a Stand naturally at birth, through rigorous spiritual and/or Ripple training, through exceptionally strong willpower, desire and/or passion, or through inheritance from bloodline. A Stand may never manifest itself until it is amplified by certain conditions or factors and not everyone has the ability to control it. Some Stands appear to have a separate and autonomous personality from their users, able to act on their own to protect them or speak to them. Generally, if the Stand user is incapacitated, the Stand will no longer be a threat (with an exception in Part 5), and any damage to a stand will be reflected on its user, and vice versa.\n* '''Part 4:''' ''[[Diamond Is Unbreakable]]'' introduces a {{nihongo|Bow and Arrow|\u5f13\u3068\u77e2|Yumi to Ya}}, forged from a mysterious meteorite that made its way to Earth after being drawn in by the spiritual powers of the planet's inhabitants. A Stand can be brought forth after one is pierced by the Arrow; however, the results can be unpredictable, as it could easily kill an unqualified person, and there is no apparent way to know if a person is qualified ahead of time. The Arrows do, however, tend to seek out qualified people on their own if there is someone to guide them.\n* '''Part 5:''' ''[[Golden Wind (manga)|Golden Wind]]'' introduces the ability to create a {{nihongo|\"Requiem\"|{{ruby-ja|\u93ae\u9b42\u6b4c|\u30ec\u30af\u30a4\u30a8\u30e0}}|Rekuiemu}} Stand. If an Arrow hits the Stand instead of the user, the Stand can completely change form and its powers become a Requiem Stand with increased powers that relate to the control over the souls of living beings. Both Giorno's Gold Experience and Polnareff's Silver Chariot are pierced by the Arrow and given Requiem forms. Silver Chariot Requiem's new ability swaps the souls of all living beings, and Gold Experience Requiem's new ability removes the consequences of any action, reverting it to a null state.\n* '''Part 6:''' ''[[Stone Ocean]]'' shows examples of a single person possessing two Stands because of the ability of an extraordinary Stand. Enrico Pucci is able to produce artificial Stand users by stealing others' Stands, transforming them into {{nihongo|Discs|\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30af|Disuku}}, and \"inserting\" them into certain individuals. Part 6 also features {{nihongo|DIO's bone|{{ruby-ja|DIO|\u30c7\u30a3\u30aa}}\u306e\u9aa8|DIO no Hone}}, the sole remaining part of DIO which is instrumental in Pucci's {{nihongo|Way to Heaven|\u5929\u56fd\u3078\u884c\u304f\u65b9\u6cd5|Tengoku e Iku H\u014dh\u014d}}. It grants a new and more powerful Stand that ultimately leads to the creation of {{nihongo|Made in Heaven|\u30e1\u30a4\u30c9\u30fb\u30a4\u30f3\u30fb\u30d8\u30d6\u30f3|Meido In Hebun}}, a powerful Stand that can accelerate the universe to the point of a universal reset in accordance with the [[Big Bounce|Big Bounce cosmological model]].\n* '''Part 7:''' ''[[Steel Ball Run]]'' introduces the {{nihongo|Spin|\u56de\u8ee2|Kaiten}}, a technique that incorporates the [[Fibonacci number|Fibonacci sequence]], [[golden spiral]], and {{nihongo|[[golden rectangle]]|\u9ec4\u91d1\u9577\u65b9\u5f62|\u014dgon ch\u014dh\u014dkei}} into a means of manipulating the [[Magnus effect]] to the user's benefit, but its true power lies in its destructive effects. Also introduced in Part 7 is the {{nihongo|Saint's Corpse|\u8056\u4eba\u306e\u907a\u4f53|Seijin no Itai}}, body parts of a deceased holy man (hinted to be [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]]) that imbue the user with a Stand if the body part is fused with the user. If the user loses the Corpse part, they lose their Stand.\n* '''Part 8:''' ''[[JoJolion]]'' introduces another method of obtaining a Stand, interaction with the {{nihongo|Wall Eyes|\u58c1\u306e\u76ee|Kabe no Me}}, strange [[fault (geology)|fault]]-like structures that have risen from the ground following the [[2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami]]. They disrupt all forms of transportation, communication, and utilities, but all users of Stands have come in contact with the Wall Eyes at some point. A race of Stand-using {{nihongo|Rock People|\u5ca9\u4eba\u9593|Iwa Ningen}} also appears in ''JoJolion''. These humans seem to innately possess the ability to turn their body into stone and enter a state of suspended animation. Also introduced in Part 8 is the {{nihongo|Rokakaka|\u30ed\u30ab\u30ab\u30ab|Rokakaka}} fruit, which is able to \"fix\" a body part at the expense of taking another away.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Paul Gauguin 106.jpg|thumb|Araki is inspired by western art, such as this piece by [[Paul Gauguin]] which inspired him to use unusual colors in his own art.<ref name=\"comipress\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nhk.or.jp/kokokoza/tv/art/archive/chapter015.html |title=NHK\u9ad8\u6821\u8b1b\u5ea7 &#124; \u82b8\u8853\uff08\u7f8e\u8853\u2160\uff0f\u66f8\u9053\u2160\uff09 &#124; \u7b2c15\u56de \u7f8e\u8853(8) \u6f2b\u753b\u306f\u3084\u3063\u3071\u308a\u304a\u3082\u3057\u308d\u3044 \u301c\u4eba\u7269\u301c |publisher=Nhk.or.jp |date= |accessdate=August 3, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810200320/http://www.nhk.or.jp/kokokoza/tv/art/archive/chapter015.html |archivedate=August 10, 2014}}</ref>]]\nFor ''JoJo's Bizarre Adventure'', Araki wanted to use a classical method as a base and then introduce modern elements in the singular.
