The current Leader of the Opposition is Sir [[Keir Starmer]], Leader of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], who was elected to the [[2020 Labour Party leadership election|leadership]] of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] on 4 April 2020.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-52164589 | title=Keir Starmer elected as new Labour leader | publisher=BBC | date=4 April 2020 | accessdate=4 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe Leader of the Opposition is normally viewed as an alternative or shadow [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], and is appointed to the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]]. They lead an [[Official Opposition Shadow Cabinet (United Kingdom)|Official Opposition Shadow Cabinet]] which scrutinises the actions of the [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]] led by the Prime Minister, as well as offer alternative policies.\n\nThere is also a Leader of the Opposition in the [[House of Lords]] (currently [[Angela Smith, Baroness Smith of Basildon|The Baroness Smith of Basildon]]). In the nineteenth century party affiliations were generally less fixed and leaders in the two Houses were often of equal status. A single, clear Leader of the Opposition was only definitively settled if the opposition leader in Commons or Lords was the outgoing prime minister. However, since the [[Parliament Act 1911]] there has been no dispute that the leader in the House of Commons is pre-eminent and has always held the main title.\n\nThe Leader of the Opposition is entitled to a salary in addition to their salary as a [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]]. In 2010, this additional entitlement was available up to \u00a373,617.<ref name=\"salary\">{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/documents/upload/m06.pdf|title=parliament.uk|date=May 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100430063450/http://www.parliament.uk/documents/upload/M06.pdf |archivedate=30 April 2010|accessdate=8 May 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Leaders of the Opposition from 1807==\n{{More citations needed section|date=May 2014}}\nThe first modern Leader of the Opposition was [[Charles James Fox]], who led the Whigs as such for a generation, except during the [[Fox\u2013North Coalition]] in 1783. He finally rejoined the government in 1806, and died later that year.\n[[File:Charles James Fox by Karl Anton Hickel.jpg|thumb|220px|Charles James Fox, Leader of the Opposition 1783\u20131806]]\n\n===Early developments 1807\u201330===\nFor there to be a recognised Leader of the Opposition, it is necessary for there to be a sufficiently cohesive opposition to need a formal leader.  The emergence of the office thus coincided with the period when wholly united parties ([[Whig Party (UK)|Whig]] and [[Tory Party|Tory]], governments and oppositions) became the norm.<ref name=foord>''His Majesty's Opposition 1714\u20131830'', Archibald S. Foord, Oxford University Press (1964), 494 pages {{ISBN|0198213115}}.</ref> This situation was normalised in the Parliament of 1807\u20131812, when the members of the Grenvillite and Foxite Whig factions resolved to maintain a joint, dual-house leadership for the whole party.\n\nThe [[Ministry of all the Talents]], in which both Whig factions participated fell at the [[1807 United Kingdom general election|1807 general election]], during which the Whigs had re-adopted traditional factions, forming ''an'' opposition.  The prime minister of the Talents ministry, [[William Wyndham Grenville, 1st Baron Grenville|Lord Grenville]] had led his eponymous faction from the [[House of Lords]].  Meanwhile, the government leader of the House of Commons, [[Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey|Viscount Howick]] (later known as Earl Grey and the political heir of [[Charles James Fox]] who had died in 1806), led his faction, the Foxite whigs, from the House of Commons.<ref name=foord/>\n\nHowick's father, [[Charles Grey, 1st Earl Grey|the 1st Earl Grey]] died on 14 November 1807. As such the new Earl Grey vacated his seat in the House of Commons and moved to the House of Lords. This left no obvious Whig leader in the House of Commons.<ref name=foord/>\n\nGrenville's article in the ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'' confirms that he was  considered the Whig leader in the House of Lords between 1807 and 1817, despite Grey leading the larger faction.\n\nGrenville and Grey, political historian Archibald Foord describes as being \"[[duumvirate|duumvirs]] of the party from 1807 to 1817\" and consulted about what was to be done. Grenville was at first reluctant to name a Leader of the Opposition in the House of Commons, commenting \"... all the elections in the world would not have made Windham or Sheridan leaders of the old Opposition while Fox was alive ...\".\n\nEventually they jointly recommended [[George Ponsonby]] to the Whig MPs, whom they accepted as the first Leader of the Opposition in the House of Commons. Ponsonby, an Irish lawyer who was the uncle of Grey's wife, had been [[Lord Chancellor of Ireland]] during the Ministry of all the Talents and had only just been re-elected to the House of Commons in 1808 when he became leader.<ref name=foord/> Ponsonby proved a weak leader but as he could not be persuaded to resign and the duumvirs did not want to depose him, he remained in place until he died in 1817.<ref name=foord/>\n\nLord Grenville retired from active politics in 1817, leaving Grey as the Leader of the Opposition in the House of Lords. Grey was not a former prime minister in 1817, unlike Grenville, so under the convention that developed later in the century he would have been in theory of equal status to whoever was leader in the other House. However, there was little doubt that if a Whig ministry was possible, Grey rather than the less distinguished Commons leaders would have been invited to form that government. In this respect Grey's position was like that of the Earl of Derby in the Protectionist Conservative opposition of the late 1840s and early 1850s.<ref name=foord/>\n\nEarl Grey witnessed a delay of about a year, until 1818, before a new Leader of the Opposition in the House of Commons was chosen. This was [[George Tierney]] who was reluctant to accept the leadership and had weak support from his party.  On 18 May 1819, Tierney moved a motion in the Commons for a committee on the state of the nation. This motion was defeated by 357 to 178, a division involving the largest number of MPs until the debates over the [[Reform Act 1832|Reform bill in the early 1830s]]. Foord comments that \"this defeat put an effective end to Tierney's leadership ... Tierney did not disclaim the leadership till 23 Jan. 1821 ..., but he had ceased to exercise its functions since the great defeat\".\n\nBetween 1821 and 1830 the Whig Commons leadership was left vacant. The leadership in the House of Lords was not much more effective: in 1824 Grey retired from active leadership, asking the party to follow the [[Henry Petty-Fitzmaurice, 3rd Marquess of Lansdowne|Marquess of Lansdowne]] \"as the person whom his friends were to look upon as their leader\". Lansdowne disclaimed the title of leader, although in practice he performed the function.\n\nFollowing the retirement of [[Robert Jenkinson, 2nd Earl of Liverpool|Lord Liverpool]] from the prime ministership in 1827, the party political situation changed. Neither the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]] or [[Robert Peel]] agreed to serve under [[George Canning]] and they were followed by five other members of the former Cabinet as well as forty junior members of the previous government. The Tory Party was heavily split between the \"High Tories\" (or \"Ultras\", nicknamed after [[Ultra-royalist|the contemporary party]] in France) and the moderates supporting Canning, often called '[[Canningites]]'. As a result, Canning found it difficult to maintain a government and chose to invite a number of Whigs to join his Cabinet, including [[Henry Petty-Fitzmaurice, 3rd Marquess of Lansdowne|Lord Lansdowne]]. After Canning's death, [[Frederick Robinson, 1st Viscount Goderich|Lord Goderich]] continued the coalition for a few more months.The principal opposition between April 1827 and January 1828 worked with these brief administrations, although Earl Grey and a section of the Whigs were also in opposition to the coalition government.  It was during this period that the term \"His Majesty's Opposition\" for the Opposition was coined, by [[John Cam Hobhouse]].<ref>''His Majesty's Opposition 1714\u20131830'', Archibald S. Foord, Greenwood Press, 1979, 494 pages, page 1.</ref>\n\nThe Duke of Wellington formed a ministry in January 1828 and as a direct effect of adopting in earnest the policy of [[Catholic Emancipation]] the opposition became composed of most Whigs with many Canningites and some ultra-Tories. Lord Lansdowne, in the absence of any alternative, remained the leading figure in the Whig opposition.\n\nIn 1830 Grey returned to the front rank of politics. On 30 June 1830 he denounced the government in the House of Lords. He rapidly attracted the support of opponents of the ministry. The renewal of organised opposition was also bolstered earlier in the year by the election of a new Leader of the Opposition in the House of Commons, the heir of Earl Spencer, [[John Spencer, 3rd Earl Spencer|Viscount Althorp]].\n\nIn November 1830 Grey was invited to form a government and resumed the formal leadership of the party and as such Wellington and Peel became the Leaders of the Opposition in the two Houses, from November 1830.\n\n===Leaders of the Opposition 1830\u20131937===\n\nIn the period of 1830\u20131937 the normal expectation was that there would be two leading parties (often with smaller allied groups), of which one would form the government and the other the opposition.<ref>The discussion in this section is based upon ''British Historical Facts 1830\u20131900'' and ''Twentieth Century British Political Facts 1900\u20132000.</ref> These parties were expected to have recognised leaders in the two Houses, so there was normally no problem in identifying who led the opposition in each House.\n\nThe constitutional convention developed in the nineteenth century was that if one of the leaders was the last prime minister of the party, then he would be considered the overall leader of his party. If that was not the case then the leaders of both Houses were of equal status. As the monarch retained some discretion as to which leader should be invited to form a ministry, it was not always obvious in advance which one would be called upon to do so.\n\nHowever, as the Leadership of the Opposition only existed by custom, the normal expectations and conventions were modified by political realities from time to time.\n\nFrom 1830 until 1846 the [[Tory Party|Tory]]/[[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] Party and the [[Whig Party (UK)|Whig Party]] (increasingly often described with its [[Radical Party (UK)|Radical]] and other allies as the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]]) alternated in power and provided clear Leaders of the Opposition.\n\nIn 1846 the Conservative Party split into (Protectionist) Conservative and [[Peelite]] (or Liberal Conservative) factions. The Protectionists being the larger group, the recognised Leaders of the Opposition were drawn from their ranks. In the House of Lords, Lord Stanley (soon becoming [[Edward Smith-Stanley, 14th Earl of Derby|Earl of Derby]]) was the Protectionist leader. He was the only established front rank political figure in the faction and thus a very strong candidate to form the next Conservative ministry.\n\nThe leadership in the House of Commons was more problematic. [[Lord George Bentinck]], the leader of the Protectionist revolt against Sir Robert Peel, initially led the party in the Commons. He resigned in December 1847. The party was then faced with the problem of how to produce a credible leader, who was not [[Benjamin Disraeli]].  The first attempt to square the circle, was made in February 1848, when the young [[Charles Manners, 6th Duke of Rutland|Marquess of Granby]] was installed as the leader. He gave up the post in March 1848. The leadership then fell vacant until February 1849.\n\nThe next experiment was to entrust the leadership to a [[triumvirate]] of Granby, Disraeli and the elderly [[John Charles Herries]]. In practice Disraeli ignored his co-triumvirs. In 1851 Granby resigned and the party accepted Disraeli as the sole leader. The Protectionists by then were clearly the core of the Conservative Party and Derby was able to form his first government in 1852.\n\nThe Liberal Party was formally founded in 1859, replacing the Whig Party as one of the two leading parties. With increasing party discipline it became easier to define the principal opposition party and the Leaders of the Opposition.\n\nThe last overall Leader of the Opposition to have led it from the House of Lords was the [[Archibald Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery|Earl of Rosebery]]. He resigned as such in November 1896.  Lord Rosebery had been [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] prime minister from 1894 to 1895.\n\n[[File:Andrew Bonar Law Vanity Fair 10 April 1912.jpg|thumb|right|<center>\"the opposition\"<center>[[Bonar Law]] as caricatured in ''[[Vanity Fair (British magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', April 1912</center>]]\nThe [[Parliament Act 1911]] removed the [[legislature|legislative]] veto from the [[House of Lords]] to permit the welfare-state forming [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] legislation to be enacted by the Commons, the [[People's Budget]] and any future [[Money Bill]]s without any input from the Lords.  This therefore entrenched the de facto position that there could only be one true Leader of the Opposition and in effect clarified in which house that leader would need to sit.  From this point, all Leaders of the Opposition in the House of Commons would thus be overall Leaders of the Opposition.\n\nIn 1915 the Liberal, Conservative and [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] parties formed a coalition. The [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] did not join the government but were by and large not in opposition to it. As almost nobody in the Parliament could be said to be in opposition to the coalition, the leaderships of the opposition in both Houses fell vacant.\n\n[[Edward Carson, Baron Carson|Sir Edward Carson]], the leading figure among the Irish Unionist part of the Conservative and Unionist Party, resigned from the coalition ministry on 19 October 1915. He then became the leader of those Unionists who were not members of the government, effectively Leader of the Opposition in the Commons.\n\nThe party situation changed in December 1916: a leading Liberal, [[David Lloyd George]], formed a coalition with the support of a section of \"Coalition Liberal\", Conservative and Labour parties. The Liberal leader, [[H. H. Asquith]], and most of his leading colleagues left the government and took up seats on the opposition side of the House of Commons. Asquith was recognised as the Leader of the Opposition. He retained that post until he was defeated in the [[1918 United Kingdom general election]]. Although Asquith continued to be the leader of the Liberal Party, as he was not a member of the House of Commons he was not eligible to be Leader of the Opposition.\n\nThe Parliament elected in [[1918 United Kingdom general election|December 1918]] which sat from 1919 until 1922, represents the most significant deviation from the principle that the Leader of the Opposition is the leader of the party not in government with the greatest numerical support in the House of Commons. The largest opposition party (disregarding [[Sinn F\u00e9in]], whose MPs did not take their seats at Westminster), was the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] which had wholly left the Lloyd George coalition and won 57 seats at the general election. Thirty six Liberals had been elected without coalition support however were mixed in their opposition to Lloyd George. The Labour Party did not have a leader until 1922. The Parliamentary Labour Party annually elected a chairman, but the party, due to its congressional origins, refused to assert a claim that the chairman was the Leader of the Opposition. Although the issue of who was entitled to be Leader of the Opposition was never formally resolved, in practice the Opposition Liberal leader performed most of the parliamentary functions associated with the office.\n\nThe small group of opposition Liberals met in 1919, distanced by his coalition's protectionism and nationalization. They resolved that they were the Liberal Parliamentary Party. They elected [[Donald Maclean (British politician)|Sir Donald Maclean]] as Chairman of the Parliamentary Party. Liberal Party practice at the time, when the overall Leader of the Party had lost an election to the House of Commons, was for the chairman to function as acting leader in the House. Maclean therefore took on the role of Leader of the Opposition, followed by Asquith, who returned to the House by winning a [[1920 Paisley by-election|by-election]] (1920\u201322).\n\nFrom 1922 the Labour Party had a recognised leader so took over all remaining commons opposition roles from the Opposition Liberal Party.  Since 1922 the principal Government and Opposition parties have been the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] and the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]].  There were three instances of peers being seriously considered for the prime ministership, during the twentieth century ([[George Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston|Curzon of Kedleston]] in 1923, [[E. F. L. Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Halifax]] in 1940 and [[Alec Douglas-Home|Home]] in 1963), but these were all cases where the Conservative Party was in government and do not affect the list of Leaders of the Opposition.\n\nIn 1931\u201332 the Leader of the Labour Party was [[Arthur Henderson]]. He was Leader of the Opposition for a short period in 1931, but was ineligible to continue when he lost his seat in the 1931 general election. [[George Lansbury]] was Leader of the Opposition before he also became the Leader of the Labour Party in 1932.\n\n===Statutory Leaders of the Opposition from 1937===\nLeaders of the Opposition in the two Houses of Parliament had been generally recognised and given a special status in Parliament for more than a century before they were mentioned in legislation.\n\n''[[Erskine May: Parliamentary Practice]]'' confirms that the office of Leader of the Opposition was first given statutory recognition in the [[Ministers of the Crown Act 1937]].\n\n* Section 5 states that \"There shall be paid to the Leader of the Opposition an annual salary of two thousand pounds\".\n* Section 10(1) includes a definition (which codifies the usual situation under the previous custom)  \"Leader of the Opposition\" means that member of the House of Commons who is for the time being the leader in that House of the party in opposition to His Majesty's Government having the greatest numerical strength in that House\".\n* The 1937 Act also contains an important provision to decide who is the Leader of the Opposition, if this is in doubt. Under section 10(3) \"If any doubt arises as to which is or was at any material time the party in opposition to His Majesty's Government having the greatest numerical strength in the House of Commons, or as to who is or was at any material time the leader in that House of such a party the question shall be decided for the purposes of this Act by the Speaker of the House of Commons, and his decision, certified in writing under his hand, shall be final and conclusive\".\n\nSubsequent legislation also gave statutory recognition to the Leader of the Opposition in the House of Lords.\n\n* Section 2(1) of the [[Ministerial and other Salaries Act 1975]], provides that \"In this Act \"Leader of the Opposition\" means, in relation to either House of Parliament, that member of that House who is for the time being the Leader in that House of the party in opposition to Her Majesty's Government having the greatest numerical strength in the House of Commons\".\n* Section 2(2) is in exactly the same terms as section 10(3) of the 1937 Act (apart from substituting Her Majesty's for His Majesty's).\n* Section 2(3) is a corresponding provision for the [[Lord Chancellor]] (since 2005, the [[Lord Speaker]]) to decide about the Leader of the Opposition in the House of Lords.\n\nThe legislative provisions confirm that Leader of the Opposition is, strictly, a Parliamentary office; so that to be leader a person must be a member of the House in which he or she leads.\n\nSince 1937 the Leader of the Opposition has received a state salary in addition to their salary as a [[Member of Parliament]] (MP), now equivalent to a Cabinet Minister. The holder also receives a [[chauffeur]]-driven car for official business of equivalent cost and specification to the vehicles used by most [[minister (government)|cabinet ministers]].\n\nIn 1940 the three largest parties in the House of Commons formed a coalition government to continue to prosecute the Second World War. This coalition continued in office until shortly after the defeat of Germany in 1945. As the former Leader of the Opposition had joined the government the issue arose of who was to hold the office or perform its functions. ''Keesing's Contemporary Archives 1937\u20131940'' (at paragraph 4069D) reported the situation, based on ''[[Hansard]]'':\n\n<blockquote>\nThe Prime Minister replying to Mr Denman in the House of Commons on 21 May, said that in view of the formation of an Administration embracing the three main political parties, H.M. Government was of the opinion that the provision of the Ministers of the Crown Act, 1937, relating to the payment of a salary to the Leader of the Opposition was in abeyance for the time being, as there was no alternative party capable of forming a Government. He added that he did not consider amending legislation necessary.\n</blockquote>\n\nThe ''[[Daily Herald (UK newspaper)|Daily Herald]]'' reported that the [[Parliamentary Labour Party]] met on 22 May 1940 and unanimously elected Dr [[Hastings Bertrand Lees-Smith|H.B. Lees-Smith]] as Chairman of the PLP (an office normally held by the party leader at that time) and as spokesman of the Party from the opposition front bench.\n\nAfter the death of Lees-Smith, on 18 December 1941, the PLP held a meeting on 21 January 1942. [[Frederick Pethick-Lawrence]] was unanimously elected Chairman of the PLP and the official spokesman of the party in the House of Commons while the party leader was serving in the government. After the deputy leader of the party ([[Arthur Greenwood]]) left the government on 22 February 1942 he took over these roles from Pethick-Lawrence until the end of the coalition and the resumption of normal party politics.\n\n==List of Leaders of the Opposition==\nThe table lists the people who were, or who acted as, Leaders of the Opposition in the two Houses of Parliament since 1807, prior to which the post was held by [[Charles James Fox]] for decades.\n\nThe leaders of the two Houses were of equal status, before 1911, unless one was the most recent Prime Minister for the party. Such a former prime minister was considered to be the overall Leader of the Opposition. From 1911 the Leader of the Opposition in the House of Commons was considered to be the overall Leader of the Opposition. Overall leaders names are bolded. Acting leaders names are in italics unless the acting leader subsequently became a full leader during a continuous period as leader.\n\nDue to the fragmentation of both principal parties in 1827\u201330, the leaders and principal opposition parties suggested for those years are provisional.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Date\n!colspan=2|Principal party<br />of

This may possibly have also been the case in 1828\u201330. Grey's article in the ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'' suggests \"... though he called on Lansdowne to take up the leadership of the opposition he was still unwilling to give it up altogether\". Grey was in opposition in 1827\u201328, when Lansdowne was in government. Given the confusion of the politics of the period, particularly after 1827 when both principal parties were fragmented, it is possible that Grey should be considered Leader of the Opposition 1824\u20131830. However the definite statements (by Foord) that Grey resigned the leadership in 1824 and (by Cook & Keith) that Grey did not resume the leadership until November 1830 leads to a different conclusion.\n: {{note label|B|B|B}} An alternative interpretation is that Palmerston (the immediate past Prime Minister) and Lord John Russell (a previous Prime Minister) were joint leaders.

The only party not in Asquith's Liberal, Conservative, Labour Coalition was the Irish Nationalist Party led by [[John Redmond]]. However, this party supported the government and did not function as an Opposition. [[Edward Carson, Baron Carson|Sir Edward Carson]], the leading figure amongst the Irish Unionist allies of the Conservative Party, resigned from the coalition ministry on 19 October 1915. He then became the de facto leader of those Unionists who were not members of the government, effectively Leader of the Opposition in the Commons.\n: {{note label|G|G|G}} Asquith lost his seat in the House of Commons in December 1918.\n: {{note label|H|H|H}} Douglas in ''The History of the Liberal Party 1895\u20131970'' observes that \"The technical question whether the Leader of the Opposition was Maclean or [[William Adamson]], Chairman of the Parliamentary Labour Party, was never fully resolved ... The fact that Adamson did not press his claim for Opposition leadership is of more than technical interest, for it shows that the Labour Party was still not taking itself seriously as a likely alternative government\".\n: {{note label|I|I|I}} The Labour Party did not appoint a leader in the Lords until it formed its first government in 1924.\n: {{note label|J|J|J}} Henderson lost his seat in the House of Commons on 27 October 1931.\n: {{note label|K|K|K}} Lansbury was acting as leader, in the absence from the House of Commons of Henderson, in 1931\u20131932; before becoming party leader himself in 1932.\n: {{note label|L|L|L}} Attlee was acting as leader, after the resignation of Lansbury on 25 October 1935, before being elected party leader himself on 3 December 1935.\n: {{note label|M|M|M}} During World War II a succession of three Labour politicians acted as Leader of the Opposition for the purpose of allowing the House of Commons to function normally, however as in the mid World War I ministry, opposition did not run under a party-whipped system. As the Government 1940\u201345 was a coalition government in which Labour politicians functioned fully as members of the Government: neither [[Deputy Prime Minister (UK)|Deputy Prime Minister]] Clement Attlee nor these three received the salary for the post of Leader of the Opposition. The largest party that opposed the war and was not part of the coalition \u2013 and therefore, in theory, the opposition was the [[Independent Labour Party]] led by [[James Maxton]]. With only three MPs, it tried to take over the opposition frontbench but was widely opposed in this venture.\n: {{note label|N|N|N}} Lord Addison was not a member of the wartime coalition government. When Labour was part of the government from May 1940 until May 1945, Addison functioned as a formal, procedural Opposition Leader, in the same way as the acting Leaders of the Opposition in the House of Commons.\n: {{note label|O|O|O}} Viscount Cranborne is the main subsidiary title to the [[Marquess of Salisbury]] given to its heir. Two Lords Cranborne have been Leader of the Opposition in the House of Lords.

Before 1981 the leader, in opposition, was elected annually by the parliamentary Labour Party.

In the nineteenth century party affiliations were generally less fixed and leaders in the two Houses were often of equal status. A single, clear Leader of the Opposition was only definitively settled if the opposition leader in Commons or Lords was the outgoing prime minister. However, since the [[Parliament Act 1911]] there has been no dispute that the leader in the House of Commons is pre-eminent and has always held the main title.\n\nThe Leader of the Opposition is entitled to a salary in addition to their salary as a [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]].

He finally rejoined the government in 1806, and died later that year.\n[[File:Charles James Fox by Karl Anton Hickel.jpg|thumb|220px|Charles James Fox, Leader of the Opposition 1783\u20131806]]\n\n===Early developments 1807\u201330===\nFor there to be a recognised Leader of the Opposition, it is necessary for there to be a sufficiently cohesive opposition to need a formal leader.  The emergence of the office thus coincided with the period when wholly united parties ([[Whig Party (UK)|Whig]] and [[Tory Party|Tory]], governments and oppositions) became the norm.<ref name=foord>''His Majesty's Opposition 1714\u20131830'', Archibald S. Foord, Oxford University Press (1964), 494 pages {{ISBN|0198213115}}.</ref> This situation was normalised in the Parliament of 1807\u20131812, when the members of the Grenvillite and Foxite Whig factions resolved to maintain a joint, dual-house leadership for the whole party.\n\nThe [[Ministry of all the Talents]], in which both Whig factions participated fell at the [[1807 United Kingdom general election|1807 general election]], during which the Whigs had re-adopted traditional factions, forming ''an'' opposition.  The prime minister of the Talents ministry, [[William Wyndham Grenville, 1st Baron Grenville|Lord Grenville]] had led his eponymous faction from the [[House of Lords]].  Meanwhile, the government leader of the House of Commons, [[Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey|Viscount Howick]] (later known as Earl Grey and the political heir of [[Charles James Fox]] who had died in 1806), led his faction, the Foxite whigs, from the House of Commons.<ref name=foord/>\n\nHowick's father, [[Charles Grey, 1st Earl Grey|the 1st Earl Grey]] died on 14 November 1807. As such the new Earl Grey vacated his seat in the House of Commons and moved to the House of Lords. This left no obvious Whig leader in the House of Commons.<ref name=foord/>\n\nGrenville's article in the ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'' confirms that he was  considered the Whig leader in the House of Lords between 1807 and 1817, despite Grey leading the larger faction.\n\nGrenville and Grey, political historian Archibald Foord describes as being \"[[duumvirate|duumvirs]] of the party from 1807 to 1817\" and consulted about what was to be done. Grenville was at first reluctant to name a Leader of the Opposition in the House of Commons, commenting \"... all the elections in the world would not have made Windham or Sheridan leaders of the old Opposition while Fox was alive ...\".\n\nEventually they jointly recommended [[George Ponsonby]] to the Whig MPs, whom they accepted as the first Leader of the Opposition in the House of Commons. Ponsonby, an Irish lawyer who was the uncle of Grey's wife, had been [[Lord Chancellor of Ireland]] during the Ministry of all the Talents and had only just been re-elected to the House of Commons in 1808 when he became leader.<ref name=foord/> Ponsonby proved a weak leader but as he could not be persuaded to resign and the duumvirs did not want to depose him, he remained in place until he died in 1817.<ref name=foord/>\n\nLord Grenville retired from active politics in 1817, leaving Grey as the Leader of the Opposition in the House of Lords. Grey was not a former prime minister in 1817, unlike Grenville, so under the convention that developed later in the century he would have been in theory of equal status to whoever was leader in the other House. However, there was little doubt that if a Whig ministry was possible, Grey rather than the less distinguished Commons leaders would have been invited to form that government. In this respect Grey's position was like that of the Earl of Derby in the Protectionist Conservative opposition of the late 1840s and early 1850s.<ref name=foord/>\n\nEarl Grey witnessed a delay of about a year, until 1818, before a new Leader of the Opposition in the House of Commons was chosen. This was [[George Tierney]] who was reluctant to accept the leadership and had weak support from his party.  On 18 May 1819, Tierney moved a motion in the Commons for a committee on the state of the nation. This motion was defeated by 357 to 178, a division involving the largest number of MPs until the debates over the [[Reform Act 1832|Reform bill in the early 1830s]]. Foord comments that \"this defeat put an effective end to Tierney's leadership ... Tierney did not disclaim the leadership till 23 Jan. 1821 ..., but he had ceased to exercise its functions since the great defeat\".\n\nBetween 1821 and 1830 the Whig Commons leadership was left vacant. The leadership in the House of Lords was not much more effective: in 1824 Grey retired from active leadership, asking the party to follow the [[Henry Petty-Fitzmaurice, 3rd Marquess of Lansdowne|Marquess of Lansdowne]] \"as the person whom his friends were to look upon as their leader\". Lansdowne disclaimed the title of leader, although in practice he performed the function.\n\nFollowing the retirement of [[Robert Jenkinson, 2nd Earl of Liverpool|Lord Liverpool]] from the prime ministership in 1827, the party political situation changed. Neither the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]] or [[Robert Peel]] agreed to serve under [[George Canning]] and they were followed by five other members of the former Cabinet as well as forty junior members of the previous government. The Tory Party was heavily split between the \"High Tories\" (or \"Ultras\", nicknamed after [[Ultra-royalist|the contemporary party]] in France) and the moderates supporting Canning, often called '[[Canningites]]'. As a result, Canning found it difficult to maintain a government and chose to invite a number of Whigs to join his Cabinet, including [[Henry Petty-Fitzmaurice, 3rd Marquess of Lansdowne|Lord Lansdowne]]. After Canning's death, [[Frederick Robinson, 1st Viscount Goderich|Lord Goderich]] continued the coalition for a few more months.The principal opposition between April 1827 and January 1828 worked with these brief administrations, although Earl Grey and a section of the Whigs were also in opposition to the coalition government.  It was during this period that the term \"His Majesty's Opposition\" for the Opposition was coined, by [[John Cam Hobhouse]].<ref>''His Majesty's Opposition 1714\u20131830'', Archibald S. Foord, Greenwood Press, 1979, 494 pages, page 1.</ref>\n\nThe Duke of Wellington formed a ministry in January 1828 and as a direct effect of adopting in earnest the policy of [[Catholic Emancipation]] the opposition became composed of most Whigs with many Canningites and some ultra-Tories. Lord Lansdowne, in the absence of any alternative, remained the leading figure in the Whig opposition.\n\nIn 1830 Grey returned to the front rank of politics. On 30 June 1830 he denounced the government in the House of Lords. He rapidly attracted the support of opponents of the ministry. The renewal of organised opposition was also bolstered earlier in the year by the election of a new Leader of the Opposition in the House of Commons, the heir of Earl Spencer, [[John Spencer, 3rd Earl Spencer|Viscount Althorp]].\n\nIn November 1830 Grey was invited to form a government and resumed the formal leadership of the party and as such Wellington and Peel became the Leaders of the Opposition in the two Houses, from November 1830.\n\n===Leaders of the Opposition 1830\u20131937===\n\nIn the period of 1830\u20131937 the normal expectation was that there would be two leading parties (often with smaller allied groups), of which one would form the government and the other the opposition.<ref>The discussion in this section is based upon ''British Historical Facts 1830\u20131900'' and ''Twentieth Century British Political Facts 1900\u20132000.</ref> These parties were expected to have recognised leaders in the two Houses, so there was normally no problem in identifying who led the opposition in each House.\n\nThe constitutional convention developed in the nineteenth century was that if one of the leaders was the last prime minister of the party, then he would be considered the overall leader of his party. If that was not the case then the leaders of both Houses were of equal status. As the monarch retained some discretion as to which leader should be invited to form a ministry, it was not always obvious in advance which one would be called upon to do so.\n\nHowever, as the Leadership of the Opposition only existed by custom, the normal expectations and conventions were modified by political realities from time to time.\n\nFrom 1830 until 1846 the [[Tory Party|Tory]]/[[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] Party and the [[Whig Party (UK)|Whig Party]] (increasingly often described with its [[Radical Party (UK)|Radical]] and other allies as the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]]) alternated in power and provided clear Leaders of the Opposition.\n\nIn 1846 the Conservative Party split into (Protectionist) Conservative and [[Peelite]] (or Liberal Conservative) factions. The Protectionists being the larger group, the recognised Leaders of the Opposition were drawn from their ranks. In the House of Lords, Lord Stanley (soon becoming [[Edward Smith-Stanley, 14th Earl of Derby|Earl of Derby]]) was the Protectionist leader. He was the only established front rank political figure in the faction and thus a very strong candidate to form the next Conservative ministry.\n\nThe leadership in the House of Commons was more problematic. [[Lord George Bentinck]], the leader of the Protectionist revolt against Sir Robert Peel, initially led the party in the Commons. He resigned in December 1847. The party was then faced with the problem of how to produce a credible leader, who was not [[Benjamin Disraeli]].  The first attempt to square the circle, was made in February 1848, when the young [[Charles Manners, 6th Duke of Rutland|Marquess of Granby]] was installed as the leader. He gave up the post in March 1848. The leadership then fell vacant until February 1849.\n\nThe next experiment was to entrust the leadership to a [[triumvirate]] of Granby, Disraeli and the elderly [[John Charles Herries]]. In practice Disraeli ignored his co-triumvirs. In 1851 Granby resigned and the party accepted Disraeli as the sole leader. The Protectionists by then were clearly the core of the Conservative Party and Derby was able to form his first government in 1852.\n\nThe Liberal Party was formally founded in 1859, replacing the Whig Party as one of the two leading parties. With increasing party discipline it became easier to define the principal opposition party and the Leaders of the Opposition.\n\nThe last overall Leader of the Opposition to have led it from the House of Lords was the [[Archibald Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery|Earl of Rosebery]]. He resigned as such in November 1896.  Lord Rosebery had been [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] prime minister from 1894 to 1895.\n\n[[File:Andrew Bonar Law Vanity Fair 10 April 1912.jpg|thumb|right|<center>\"the opposition\"<center>[[Bonar Law]] as caricatured in ''[[Vanity Fair (British magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', April 1912</center>]]\nThe [[Parliament Act 1911]] removed the [[legislature|legislative]] veto from the [[House of Lords]] to permit the welfare-state forming [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] legislation to be enacted by the Commons, the [[People's Budget]] and any future [[Money Bill]]s without any input from the Lords.  This therefore entrenched the de facto position that there could only be one true Leader of the Opposition and in effect clarified in which house that leader would need to sit.  From this point, all Leaders of the Opposition in the House of Commons would thus be overall Leaders of the Opposition.\n\nIn 1915 the Liberal, Conservative and [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] parties formed a coalition. The [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] did not join the government but were by and large not in opposition to it. As almost nobody in the Parliament could be said to be in opposition to the coalition, the leaderships of the opposition in both Houses fell vacant.\n\n[[Edward Carson, Baron Carson|Sir Edward Carson]], the leading figure among the Irish Unionist part of the Conservative and Unionist Party, resigned from the coalition ministry on 19 October 1915. He then became the leader of those Unionists who were not members of the government, effectively Leader of the Opposition in the Commons.\n\nThe party situation changed in December 1916: a leading Liberal, [[David Lloyd George]], formed a coalition with the support of a section of \"Coalition Liberal\", Conservative and Labour parties. The Liberal leader, [[H. H. Asquith]], and most of his leading colleagues left the government and took up seats on the opposition side of the House of Commons. Asquith was recognised as the Leader of the Opposition. He retained that post until he was defeated in the [[1918 United Kingdom general election]]. Although Asquith continued to be the leader of the Liberal Party, as he was not a member of the House of Commons he was not eligible to be Leader of the Opposition.\n\nThe Parliament elected in [[1918 United Kingdom general election|December 1918]] which sat from 1919 until 1922, represents the most significant deviation from the principle that the Leader of the Opposition is the leader of the party not in government with the greatest numerical support in the House of Commons. The largest opposition party (disregarding [[Sinn F\u00e9in]], whose MPs did not take their seats at Westminster), was the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] which had wholly left the Lloyd George coalition and won 57 seats at the general election. Thirty six Liberals had been elected without coalition support however were mixed in their opposition to Lloyd George. The Labour Party did not have a leader until 1922. The Parliamentary Labour Party annually elected a chairman, but the party, due to its congressional origins, refused to assert a claim that the chairman was the Leader of the Opposition. Although the issue of who was entitled to be Leader of the Opposition was never formally resolved, in practice the Opposition Liberal leader performed most of the parliamentary functions associated with the office.\n\nThe small group of opposition Liberals met in 1919, distanced by his coalition's protectionism and nationalization. They resolved that they were the Liberal Parliamentary Party. They elected [[Donald Maclean (British politician)|Sir Donald Maclean]] as Chairman of the Parliamentary Party. Liberal Party practice at the time, when the overall Leader of the Party had lost an election to the House of Commons, was for the chairman to function as acting leader in the House. Maclean therefore took on the role of Leader of the Opposition, followed by Asquith, who returned to the House by winning a [[1920 Paisley by-election|by-election]] (1920\u201322).\n\nFrom 1922 the Labour Party had a recognised leader so took over all remaining commons opposition roles from the Opposition Liberal Party.  Since 1922 the principal Government and Opposition parties have been the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] and the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]].  There were three instances of peers being seriously considered for the prime ministership, during the twentieth century ([[George Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston|Curzon of Kedleston]] in 1923, [[E. F. L. Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Halifax]] in 1940 and [[Alec Douglas-Home|Home]] in 1963), but these were all cases where the Conservative Party was in government and do not affect the list of Leaders of the Opposition.\n\nIn 1931\u201332 the Leader of the Labour Party was [[Arthur Henderson]]. He was Leader of the Opposition for a short period in 1931, but was ineligible to continue when he lost his seat in the 1931 general election. [[George Lansbury]] was Leader of the Opposition before he also became the Leader of the Labour Party in 1932.\n\n===Statutory Leaders of the Opposition from 1937===\nLeaders of the Opposition in the two Houses of Parliament had been generally recognised and given a special status in Parliament for more than a century before they were mentioned in legislation.\n\n''[[Erskine May: Parliamentary Practice]]'' confirms that the office of Leader of the Opposition was first given statutory recognition in the [[Ministers of the Crown Act 1937]].\n\n* Section 5 states that \"There shall be paid to the Leader of the Opposition an annual salary of two thousand pounds\".\n* Section 10(1) includes a definition (which codifies the usual situation under the previous custom)  \"Leader of the Opposition\" means that member of the House of Commons who is for the time being the leader in that House of the party in opposition to His Majesty's Government having the greatest numerical strength in that House\".\n* The 1937 Act also contains an important provision to decide who is the Leader of the Opposition, if this is in doubt. Under section 10(3) \"If any doubt arises as to which is or was at any material time the party in opposition to His Majesty's Government having the greatest numerical strength in the House of Commons, or as to who is or was at any material time the leader in that House of such a party the question shall be decided for the purposes of this Act by the Speaker of the House of Commons, and his decision, certified in writing under his hand, shall be final and conclusive\".\n\nSubsequent legislation also gave statutory recognition to the Leader of the Opposition in the House of Lords.\n\n* Section 2(1) of the [[Ministerial and other Salaries Act 1975]], provides that \"In this Act \"Leader of the Opposition\" means, in relation to either House of Parliament, that member of that House who is for the time being the Leader in that House of the party in opposition to Her Majesty's Government having the greatest numerical strength in the House of Commons\".\n* Section 2(2) is in exactly the same terms as section 10(3) of the 1937 Act (apart from substituting Her Majesty's for His Majesty's).\n* Section 2(3) is a corresponding provision for the [[Lord Chancellor]] (since 2005, the [[Lord Speaker]]) to decide about the Leader of the Opposition in the House of Lords.\n\nThe legislative provisions confirm that Leader of the Opposition is, strictly, a Parliamentary office; so that to be leader a person must be a member of the House in which he or she leads.\n\nSince 1937 the Leader of the Opposition has received a state salary in addition to their salary as a [[Member of Parliament]] (MP), now equivalent to a Cabinet Minister. The holder also receives a [[chauffeur]]-driven car for official business of equivalent cost and specification to the vehicles used by most [[minister (government)|cabinet ministers]].\n\nIn 1940 the three largest parties in the House of Commons formed a coalition government to continue to prosecute the Second World War. This coalition continued in office until shortly after the defeat of Germany in 1945. As the former Leader of the Opposition had joined the government the issue arose of who was to hold the office or perform its functions. ''Keesing's Contemporary Archives 1937\u20131940'' (at paragraph 4069D) reported the situation, based on ''[[Hansard]]'':\n\n<blockquote>\nThe Prime Minister replying to Mr Denman in the House of Commons on 21 May, said that in view of the formation of an Administration embracing the three main political parties, H.M. Government was of the opinion that the provision of the Ministers of the Crown Act, 1937, relating to the payment of a salary to the Leader of the Opposition was in abeyance for the time being, as there was no alternative party capable of forming a Government. He added that he did not consider amending legislation necessary.\n</blockquote>\n\nThe ''[[Daily Herald (UK newspaper)|Daily Herald]]'' reported that the [[Parliamentary Labour Party]] met on 22 May 1940 and unanimously elected Dr [[Hastings Bertrand Lees-Smith|H.B. Lees-Smith]] as Chairman of the PLP (an office normally held by the party leader at that time) and as spokesman of the Party from the opposition front bench.\n\nAfter the death of Lees-Smith, on 18 December 1941, the PLP held a meeting on 21 January 1942. [[Frederick Pethick-Lawrence]] was unanimously elected Chairman of the PLP and the official spokesman of the party in the House of Commons while the party leader was serving in the government. After the deputy leader of the party ([[Arthur Greenwood]]) left the government on 22 February 1942 he took over these roles from Pethick-Lawrence until the end of the coalition and the resumption of normal party politics.\n\n==List of Leaders of the Opposition==\nThe table lists the people who were, or who acted as, Leaders of the Opposition in the two Houses of Parliament since 1807, prior to which the post was held by [[Charles James Fox]] for decades.\n\nThe leaders of the two Houses were of equal status, before 1911, unless one was the most recent Prime Minister for the party. Such a former prime minister was considered to be the overall Leader of the Opposition. From 1911 the Leader of the Opposition in the House of Commons was considered to be the overall Leader of the Opposition. Overall leaders names are bolded. Acting leaders names are in italics unless the acting leader subsequently became a full leader during a continuous period as leader.\n\nDue to the fragmentation of both principal parties in 1827\u201330, the leaders and principal opposition parties suggested for those years are provisional.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Date\n!colspan=2|Principal party<br />of

This may possibly have also been the case in 1828\u201330. Grey's article in the ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'' suggests \"... though he called on Lansdowne to take up the leadership of the opposition he was still unwilling to give it up altogether\". Grey was in opposition in 1827\u201328, when Lansdowne was in government. Given the confusion of the politics of the period, particularly after 1827 when both principal parties were fragmented, it is possible that Grey should be considered Leader of the Opposition 1824\u20131830. However the definite statements (by Foord) that Grey resigned the leadership in 1824 and (by Cook & Keith) that Grey did not resume the leadership until November 1830 leads to a different conclusion.\n: {{note label|B|B|B}} An alternative interpretation is that Palmerston (the immediate past Prime Minister) and Lord John Russell (a previous Prime Minister) were joint leaders. Cook & Keith have Palmerston as the sole leader.\n: {{note label|C|C|C}} Harcourt resigned 14 December 1898.\n: {{note label|D|D|D}} Rosebery resigned 6 October 1896.\n: {{note label|E|E|E}} Balfour lost his seat in the House of Commons in January 1906.\n: {{note label|F|F|F}} During Asquith's coalition government of 1915\u20131916, there was no formal opposition in either the Commons or the Lords. The only party not in Asquith's Liberal, Conservative, Labour Coalition was the Irish Nationalist Party led by [[John Redmond]]. However, this party supported the government and did not function as an Opposition. [[Edward Carson, Baron Carson|Sir Edward Carson]], the leading figure amongst the Irish Unionist allies of the Conservative Party, resigned from the coalition ministry on 19 October 1915. He then became the de facto leader of those Unionists who were not members of the government, effectively Leader of the Opposition in the Commons.\n: {{note label|G|G|G}} Asquith lost his seat in the House of Commons in December 1918.\n: {{note label|H|H|H}} Douglas in ''The History of the Liberal Party 1895\u20131970'' observes that \"The technical question whether the Leader of the Opposition was Maclean or [[William Adamson]], Chairman of the Parliamentary Labour Party, was never fully resolved ... The fact that Adamson did not press his claim for Opposition leadership is of more than technical interest, for it shows that the Labour Party was still not taking itself seriously as a likely alternative government\".\n: {{note label|I|I|I}} The Labour Party did not appoint a leader in the Lords until it formed its first government in 1924.\n: {{note label|J|J|J}} Henderson lost his seat in the House of Commons on 27 October 1931.\n: {{note label|K|K|K}} Lansbury was acting as leader, in the absence from the House of Commons of Henderson, in 1931\u20131932; before becoming party leader himself in 1932.\n: {{note label|L|L|L}} Attlee was acting as leader, after the resignation of Lansbury on 25 October 1935, before being elected party leader himself on 3 December 1935.\n: {{note label|M|M|M}} During World War II a succession of three Labour politicians acted as Leader of the Opposition for the purpose of allowing the House of Commons to function normally, however as in the mid World War I ministry, opposition did not run under a party-whipped system. As the Government 1940\u201345 was a coalition government in which Labour politicians functioned fully as members of the Government: neither [[Deputy Prime Minister (UK)|Deputy Prime Minister]] Clement Attlee nor these three received the salary for the post of Leader of the Opposition. The largest party that opposed the war and was not part of the coalition \u2013 and therefore, in theory, the opposition was the [[Independent Labour Party]] led by [[James Maxton]]. With only three MPs, it tried to take over the opposition frontbench but was widely opposed in this venture.\n: {{note label|N|N|N}} Lord Addison was not a member of the wartime coalition government. When Labour was part of the government from May 1940 until May 1945, Addison functioned as a formal, procedural Opposition Leader, in the same way as the acting Leaders of the Opposition in the House of Commons.\n: {{note label|O|O|O}} Viscount Cranborne is the main subsidiary title to the [[Marquess of Salisbury]] given to its heir. Two Lords Cranborne have been Leader of the Opposition in the House of Lords. They sat in the House of Lords as the title unusually had an acting [[writ of acceleration]] which did entitle father and son to sit in the House, ineffective since the [[House of Lords Act 1999]].\n: {{note label|P|P|P}} Commonly referred to as the acting leader, following the death or immediate resignation of the leader, but is, according to the Labour Party Rule Book, fully leader until the next leader is selected. Before 1981 the leader, in opposition, was elected annually by the parliamentary Labour Party. From 1981 to 2010, the leader was elected by an electoral college of party members, MPs and [[Member of the European Parliament|MEPs]], as well as [[trade unions]] before the party switched to a true [[one member, one vote]] system in 2015.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]]\n*[[List of Leaders of the Opposition of the United Kingdom by length of tenure]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* ''British Historical Facts 1760\u20131830'', by Chris Cook and John Stevenson (The Macmillan Press 1980)\n* ''British Historical Facts 1830\u20131900'', by Chris Cook and Brendan Keith (The Macmillan Press 1975)\n* ''His Majesty's Opposition 1714\u20131830'', by Archibald S.

{"title_page": "Albanian tribes", "text_new": "{{Albanian tribes sidebar}}\n\nThe '''Albanian tribes''' ({{lang-sq|fiset shqiptare}}) form a historical mode of tribal social organization ('''''farefisn\u00ed''''') in [[Albania]] and the southwestern [[Balkans]] characterized by a common [[cultur]]e, often common patrilineal kinship ties tracing back to one progenitor and shared [[social ties]]. The '''''fis''''' (commonly translated as \"tribe\", also as \"clan\" or \"kin\" community) stands at the center of Albanian organization based on [[kinship]] relations, a concept which can be found among [[Tosks]] also with the term '''''far\u00eb'''''.\n\nInherited from the ancient [[Illyrians|Illyrian]] social structure, Albanian tribal society emerged in the early middle Ages as the dominant form of social organization among Albanians.{{sfn|Galaty|2002|pp=109\u2013121}}{{sfn|Villar|1996|p=316}} The development of feudalism came to both antagonize it, but also slowly integrate aspects of it in Albanian feudal society as most noble families themselves came from these tribes and depended on their support. This process stopped after the Ottoman conquest of Albania and the Balkans in the late 15th century and was followed by a process of strengthening of the tribe (''fis'') as a means of organization against Ottoman centralization particularly in the [[Northern Mountain Range (Albania)|mountains of northern Albania]] and adjacent areas of [[Montenegro]].\n\nIt also remained in a less developed system in [[southern Albania]]{{sfn|Elsie|2015|p=1}} where large feudal estates and later trade and urban centres began to develop at the expense of tribal organization. One of the most particular elements of the Albanian tribal structure is its dependence on the ''[[Kanun (Albania)|Kanun]]'', a code of [[Albanians|Albanian]] oral [[customary law]]s.{{sfn|Galaty|2002|pp=109\u2013121}} Most tribes engaged in warfare against external forces like the Ottoman Empire. Some also engaged in limited inter-tribal struggle for the control of resources.{{sfn|Elsie|2015|p=1}}\n\nUntil the early years of the 20th century, the Albanian tribal society remained largely intact until the rise to power of [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania|communist regime]] in 1944, and is considered as the only example of a tribal social system structured with tribal chiefs and councils, [[Gjakmarrja|blood feuds]] and [[Kanun (Albania)|oral customary laws]], surviving in [[Europe]] until the middle of the 20th century.{{sfn|Elsie|2015|p=1}}{{sfn|De Rapper|2012|p=1}}{{sfn|Galaty|2011|p=118}}\n\n== Terminology ==\nFundamental terms that define Albanian tribal structure are shared by all regions. Some terms may be used interchangeably with the same semantic content and other terms have a different content depending on the region. No uniform or standard classification exists as societal structure showed variance even within the same general area. The term ''fis'' is the central concept of Albanian tribal structure. The ''fis'' is a community whose members are linked to each other as kin through the same patrilineal ancestry and live in the same territory. It has been translated in English as ''tribe'' or ''clan''.{{sfn|Backer|2002|p=59}} Thus, ''fis'' refers both to the kinship ties that bond the community and the territorialization of that community in a region exclusively used in a communal manner by the members of the ''fis''. In contrast, ''bashk\u00ebsi''  (literally, ''association'') refers to a community of the same ancestry which has not been established territorialy in a given area which is considered its traditional home region. \n\nIt is further divided into ''fis i madh'' and  ''fis i vog\u00ebl''. ''Fis i madh'' refers to all members of the kin community that live in its traditional territory, while ''fis i vog\u00ebl'' refers to the immediate family members and their cousins (''kush\u00ebri'').{{sfn|Galaty|2011|p=89}} In this sense, it is sometimes used synonymously with ''v\u00ebllaz\u00ebri'' or ''vllazni'' in Geg Albanian. This term refers to all families that trace their origin to the same patrilineal ancestor. The family is referred to as ''bark''/pl. ''barqe'' (literally, ''belly''). As some tribes grew in number, a part of them settled in new territory and formed a new fis that may or may not have held the same name as the parental group. The concept of ''farefisni'' refers to the bonds between all communities that stem from the same ''fis''. ''Far\u00eb'' literally means ''seed''. Among southern Albanians, it is sometimes used as a synonym for ''fis'', which in turn is used in the meaning of ''fis i vog\u00ebl''.\n\nThe term ''[[bajrak]]'' refers to an Ottoman military institution of the 17th century. In international bibliography of the late 19th and early 20th centuries it was often mistakengly equated with the ''fis'' as both would sometimes cover the same geographical area. The result of this mistake was the portrayal of ''bajrak'' administrative divisions and other regions as ''fis'' in early anthropological accounts of Albania, although in those regions only a small part or none at all constituted a ''fis''.{{sfn|Backer|2002|p=60}}\n\n== Overview ==\n[[File:Skreli Tribesmen (W Le Queux).jpg|thumb|260px|[[Shkreli (tribe)|Shkreli]] tribesmen. Photo taken by [[William Le Queux]] before 1906.]]\n\nThe northern Albanian tribes are fiercely proud of the fact that they have never been completely conquered by external powers, in particular by the [[Ottoman Empire]]. This fact  is raised on the level of historical and heritage orthodoxy among the members of the tribes. In the 18th century the Ottomans instituted the system of [[bajrak]] military organization in northern Albania and Kosovo. From the Ottoman perspective, the institution of the bajrak had multiple benefits. Although it recognized a semi-autonomous status in communities like Hoti, it could also be used to stabilize the borderlands as these communities in their new capacity would defend the borders of the empire, as they saw in them the borders of their own territory. Furthermore, the Ottomans considered the office of head bajraktar as a means that in times of rebellion could be used to divide and conquer the tribes by handing out privileges to a select few. On the other hand, autonomy of the borderlands was also a source of conflict as the tribes tried to increase their autonomy and minimize involvement of the Ottoman state. Through a circular series of events of conflict and renegotiation a state of balance was found between Ottoman centralization and tribal autonomy. Hence, the Ottoman era is marked by both continuous conflict and a formalization of socio-economic status within Ottoman administration.{{sfn|Galaty|2011|pp=119\u2013120}}\n\nMembers of the tribes of northern Albania believe their history is based on the notions of resistance and isolationism.<ref>{{harvnb|Galaty|2011|pp=119\u2013120|ps=:... northern Albanians' belief about their own history, based on notions of isolationism and resistance}}</ref> Some scholars connect this belief with the concept of \"negotiated peripherality\". Throughout history the territory northern Albanian tribes occupy has been contested and peripheral so northern Albanian tribes often exploited their position and negotiated their peripherality in profitable ways. This peripheral position also affected their national program which significance and challenges are different from those in southern Albania.<ref>{{harvnb|Galaty|2011|pp=119\u2013120|ps=:... \"negotiated peripherality\"... the idea that people living in peripheral regions exploit their... position in important, often profitable ways...

Besa is an important part of personal and familial standing and is often used as an example of \"[[Albanianism]]\".

agreements.{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|p=36}}\n\nDuring the Ottoman period, the besa would be cited in government reports regarding Albanian unrest, especially in relation to the tribes.{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|p=119}} The besa formed a central place within Albanian society in relation to generating military and political power.{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|pp=119\u2013120}} Besas held Albanians together, united them and would wane when the will to enforce them dissipated.{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|p=120}} In times of revolt against the Ottomans by Albanians, the besa functioned as a link

having a Catholic majority and Muslim minority with [[Gruda (tribe)|Gruda]] evenly split between both religions.{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|pp=31\u201332}} Within Mal\u00ebsia e Madhe there were an additional seven small tribes.{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|pp=31\u201332}} During times of war and mobilisation of troops, the bajraktar (chieftain) of Hoti was recognised by the Ottoman government as leader of all forces

men that could be mobilised for war.{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|pp=31\u201332}} Shoshi had a distinction in the region of possessing a legendary rock associated with [[Lek\u00eb Dukagjini]].{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|pp=31\u201332}}\n\nThe [[Mirdita]] region which was also a large powerful devoutly Catholic tribe with 2,500 households and five bajraktars that could mobilize 5,000 irregular troops.{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|pp=31\u201332}} A general assembly of the Mirdita met often in [[Orosh]] to deliberate on important issues relating to the tribe.{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|pp=31\u201332}} The position of hereditary prince of the tribe with the title ''Prenk Pasha'' (Prince Lord) was held by the Gjonmarkaj family.{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|pp=31\u201332}} Apart from the princely family the [[Franciscan]] Abbot held some influence among the Mirdita tribesmen.{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|pp=31\u201332}}\n\nThe government estimated the military strength of Malisors in [[Sanjak of Scutari|\u0130\u015fkodra sanjak]] as numbering over 30,000 tribesmen and Ottoman officials were of the view that the highlanders could defeat Montenegro on their own with limited state assistance.{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|p=33}}\n\nIn Western Kosovo, the Gjakov\u00eb highlands contained eight tribes that were mainly Muslim and in the [[Luma (region)|Luma]] area near [[Prizren]] there were five tribes, mostly Muslim.{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|pp=34-35}} Other important tribal groupings further south include the highlanders of the [[Dibra]] region known as the \"Tigers of Dibra\".{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|pp=35-36}}\n\nAmong the many religiously mixed Catholic-Muslim tribes and one Muslim-Orthodox clan, Ottoman officials noted that tribal loyalties superseded religious affiliations.{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|pp=31\u201332}} In Catholic households there were instances of Christians who possessed four wives, marrying the first spouse in a church and the other three in the presence of an imam, while among Muslim households the Islamic tradition of circumcision was ignored.{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|pp=31\u201332}}\n\n== History ==\n===Late Ottoman period===\n\nDuring the [[Great Eastern Crisis]], Prenk Bib Doda, hereditary chieftain of Mirdita initiated a rebellion in mid-April 1877 against government control and the Ottoman Empire sent troops to put it down.{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|p=40}} Montenegro attempted to gain support from among the Malisors even though it lacked religious or ethnic links with the Albanian tribesmen.{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|p=53}} Amidst the Eastern Crisis and subsequent border negotiations Italy suggested in April 1880 for the Ottoman Empire to give Montenegro the Tuz district containing mainly Catholic Gruda and Hoti populations which would have left the tribes split between both countries.{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|p=62}} With Hoti this would have left an additional problem of tensions and instability due to the tribe having precedence by tradition over the other four tribes during peace and war.{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|p=62}} The tribes affected by the negotiations swore a besa (pledge) to resist any reduction of their lands and sent telegrams to surrounding regions for military assistance.{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|p=62}}\n\nDuring the late Ottoman period Ghegs often lacked education and integration within the Ottoman system, while they had autonomy and military capabilities.{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|p=29}} Those factors gave the area of Geg\u00ebnia an importance within the empire that differed from Tosk\u00ebria.{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|p=29}} Still many Ottoman officers thought that Ghegs, in particular the highlanders were often a liability instead of an asset for the state being commonly referred to as \"wild\" ({{lang-tr|vah\u015fi}}) or a backward people that lived in poverty and ignorance for 500 years being hostile to civilisation and progress.{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|pp=29, 120, 138}} In areas of Albania were Malisors lived, the empire only posted Ottoman officers who had prior experience of service in other tribal regions of the state like [[Kurdistan]] or [[Yemen]] that could bridge cultural divides with Gheg tribesmen.{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|p=113}}\n\n[[File:Albania Purger 13954.jpg|thumb|260px|left|Albanian Malisors in an early 20th postcard.]]\n\nSultan [[Abdul Hamid II]], Ottoman

lawlessness and economic dislocation.{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|pp=29, 118\u2013121, 138, 209}} To resolve disputes and clamp down on the practice the Ottoman state addressed the problem directly by sending Blood Feud Reconciliation Commissions (musalaha-\u0131 dem komisyonlar\u0131) that produced results with limited success.{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|p=119}} In the late Ottoman period, due to the influence of Catholic Franciscan priests some changes to blood feuding practices occurred among Albanian highlanders such as guilt being restricted to the offender or their household and even one tribe accepting the razing of the offender's home as compensation for the offense.{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|p=119}}\nOttoman officials were of the view that violence committed by Malisors in the 1880s-1890s was of a tribal nature not related to nationalism or religion.{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|p=121}} They also noted that Albanian tribesmen who identified with Islam did so in name only and lacked knowledge of the religion.{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|p=122}}\n\n[[File:Durham 2534.jpg|thumb|200px|Men of the [[Shkreli (tribe)|Shkreli tribe]] at the feast of [[Saint Nicholas]] at Bzheta in Shkreli territory, 1908.]]\nIn the aftermath of the [[Young Turk Revolution]] in 1908 the new Young Turk government established the Commissions for the Reconciliation of Blood Feuds that focused on the regions such as \u0130pek (Pej\u00eb) and Prizren.{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|p=161}} The commissions sentenced Albanians who had participated in blood feud killing and the Council of Ministers allowed them to continue their work in the provinces until May 1909.{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|p=161}} After the Young Turk Revolution and subsequent restoration of the [[Ottoman constitution of 1876|Ottoman constitution]], the Hoti, Shala, Shoshi and Kastati tribes made a besa (pledge) to support the document and to stop [[Gjakmarrja|blood feuding]] with other tribes until November 6 1908.{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|p=159}} The Albanian tribes showing sentiments of enthusiasm however had little knowledge of what the constitution would do for them.{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|p=160}}\n\nDuring the Albanian revolt of 1910, Malisors such as the Shala tribe fought against Ottoman troops that were sent to quell the uprising, disarm the population by collecting guns, and replace the Law of Lek with state courts and laws.{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|p=178}} Malisors instead planned further resistance and Albanian tribes living near the border fled into Montenegro while negotiating terms with the Ottomans for their return.{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|p=178}} The Ottoman commander [[Mahmud Shevket Pasha|Mahmud Shevket]] involved in military operations concluded that the bajraktars had become Albanian nationalists and posed a danger to the empire when compared to previous uprisings.{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|p=179}}\n\nThe [[Albanian revolt of 1911]] was begun during March by Catholic Albanian tribesmen after they returned from exile in Montenegro.{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|pp=186\u2013187}} The Ottoman government sent 8,000 troops to quell the uprising and ordered that tribal chieftains would need to stand trial for leading the rebellion.{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|pp=186\u2013187}} During the revolt, [[Terenzio Tocci]], an [[Arb\u00ebresh\u00eb people|Italo-Albanian]] lawyer gathered the Mirdit\u00eb chieftains on 26/27 April 1911 in Orosh and proclaimed the independence of Albania, raised the [[flag of Albania]] and declared a provisional government.{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|p=178}} After Ottoman troops entered the area to put down the rebellion, Tocci fled the empire abandoning his activities.{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|p=186}} On 23 June 1911 Albanian Malisors and other revolutionaries gathered in Montenegro and drafted the [[Gre\u00e7\u00eb Memorandum]] demanding Albanian sociopolitical and linguistic rights with signatories being from the Hoti, Gruda, Shkreli, Kelmendi and Kastrati tribes.{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|pp=186\u2013187}} In later negotiations with the Ottomans, an amnesty was granted to the tribesmen with promises by the government to build roads and schools in tribal areas, pay wages of teachers, limit military service to the Istanbul and Shkod\u00ebr areas, right to carry weapons in the  countryside but not in urban areas, the appointment of bajraktars relatives to certain administrative positions and compensate Malisors with money and food arriving back from Montenegro.{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|pp=186\u2013187}} The final agreement was signed in [[Podgorica]] by both the Ottomans and Malisors during August 1912 and the highlanders had managed to thwart the centralist tendencies of the Young Turk government in relation to their interests.{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|pp=186\u2013187}}\n\n===Independent Albania===\nThe last tribal system of Europe located in northern Albania stayed intact until 1944 when [[Party of Labour of

depopulated.{{sfn|Elsie|2015|p=11}} Much of the population seeking a better life has moved either abroad or to Albanian cities such as Tiran\u00eb, Durr\u00ebs or Shkod\u00ebr and populations

The '''''fis''''' (commonly translated as \"tribe\", also as \"clan\" or \"kin\") stands at the center of Albanian organization based on [[kinship]] relations, a concept which can be found among [[Tosks]] also with the term '''''far\u00eb'''''.\n\nInherited from the ancient [[Illyrians|Illyrian]] social structure, Albanian tribal society emerged in the early middle Ages as the dominant form of social organization among Albanians.{{sfn|Galaty|2002|pp=109\u2013121}}{{sfn|Villar|1996|p=316}} The development of feudalism came to both antagonize it, but also slowly integrate aspects of it in Albanian feudal society as most noble families themselves came from these tribes and depended on their support. This process stopped after the Ottoman conquest of Albania and the Balkans in the late 15th century and was followed by a process of strengthening of the tribe (''fis'') as a means of organization against Ottoman centralization particularly in the [[Northern Mountain Range (Albania)|mountains of northern Albania]] and adjacent areas of [[Montenegro]].\n\nIt also remained in a less developed system in [[southern Albania]]{{sfn|Elsie|2015|p=1}} where large feudal estates and later trade and urban centres began to develop at the expense of tribal organization. One of the most particular elements of the Albanian tribal structure is its dependence on the ''[[Kanun (Albania)|Kanun]]'', a code of [[Albanians|Albanian]] oral [[customary law]]s.{{sfn|Galaty|2002|pp=109\u2013121}} Most tribes engaged in warfare against external forces like the Ottoman Empire. Some also engaged in limited inter-tribal struggle for the control of resources.{{sfn|Elsie|2015|p=1}}\n\nUntil the early years of the 20th century, the Albanian tribal society remained largely intact until the rise to power of [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania|communist regime]] in 1944, and is considered as the only example of a tribal social system structured with tribal chiefs and councils, [[Gjakmarrja|blood feuds]] and [[Kanun (Albania)|oral customary laws]], surviving in [[Europe]] until the middle of the 20th century.{{sfn|Elsie|2015|p=1}}{{sfn|De Rapper|2012|p=1}}{{sfn|Galaty|2011|p=118}}\n\n== Terminology ==\nFundamental terms that define Albanian tribal structure are shared by all regions. Some terms may be used interchangeably with the same semantic content and other terms have a different content depending on the region. No uniform or standard classification exists as societal structure showed variance even within the same general area. The term ''fis'' is the central concept of Albanian tribal structure. The ''fis'' is a community whose members are linked to each other as kin through the same patrilineal ancestry and live in the same territory. It has been translated in English as ''tribe'' or ''clan''.{{sfn|Backer|2002|p=59}} Thus, ''fis'' refers both to the kinship ties that bond the community and the territorialization of that community in a region exclusively used in a communal manner by the members of the ''fis''. In contrast, ''bashk\u00ebsi''  (literally, ''association'') refers to a community of the same ancestry which has not been established territorialy in a given area which is considered its traditional home region. \n\nIt is further divided into ''fis i madh'' and  ''fis i vog\u00ebl''. ''Fis i madh'' refers to all members of the kin community that live in its traditional territory, while ''fis i vog\u00ebl'' refers to the immediate family members and their cousins (''kush\u00ebri'').{{sfn|Galaty|2011|p=89}} In this sense, it is sometimes used synonymously with ''v\u00ebllaz\u00ebri'' or ''vllazni'' in Geg Albanian. This term refers to all families that trace their origin to the same patrilineal ancestor. The family is referred to as ''bark''/pl. ''barqe'' (literally, ''belly''). As some tribes grew in number, a part of them settled in new territory and formed a new fis that may or may not have held the same name as the parental group. The concept of ''farefisni'' refers to the bonds between all communities that stem from the same ''fis''. ''Far\u00eb'' literally means ''seed''. Among southern Albanians, it is sometimes used as a synonym for ''fis'', which in turn is used in the meaning of ''fis i vog\u00ebl''.\n\nThe term ''[[bajrak]]'' refers to an Ottoman military institution of the 17th century. In international bibliography of the late 19th and early 20th centuries it was often mistakengly equated with the ''fis'' as both would sometimes cover the same geographical area. The result of this mistake was the portrayal of ''bajrak'' administrative divisions and other regions as ''fis'' in early anthropological accounts of Albania, although in those regions only a small part or none at all constituted a ''fis''.{{sfn|Backer|2002|p=60}}\n\n== Overview ==\n[[File:Skreli Tribesmen (W Le Queux).jpg|thumb|260px|[[Shkreli (tribe)|Shkreli]] tribesmen. Photo taken by [[William Le Queux]] before 1906.]]\n\nThe northern Albanian tribes are fiercely proud of the fact that they have never been completely conquered by external powers, in particular by the [[Ottoman Empire]]. This fact  is raised on the level of historical and heritage orthodoxy among the members of the tribes. In the 18th century the Ottomans instituted the system of [[bajrak]] military organization in northern Albania and Kosovo. From the Ottoman perspective, the institution of the bajrak had multiple benefits. Although it recognized a semi-autonomous status in communities like Hoti, it could also be used to stabilize the borderlands as these communities in their new capacity would defend the borders of the empire, as they saw in them the borders of their own territory. Furthermore, the Ottomans considered the office of head bajraktar as a means that in times of rebellion could be used to divide and conquer the tribes by handing out privileges to a select few. On the other hand, autonomy of the borderlands was also a source of conflict as the tribes tried to increase their autonomy and minimize involvement of the Ottoman state. Through a circular series of events of conflict and renegotiation a state of balance was found between Ottoman centralization and tribal autonomy. Hence, the Ottoman era is marked by both continuous conflict and a formalization of socio-economic status within Ottoman administration.{{sfn|Galaty|2011|pp=119\u2013120}}\n\nMembers of the tribes of northern Albania believe their history is based on the notions of resistance and isolationism.<ref>{{harvnb|Galaty|2011|pp=119\u2013120|ps=:... northern Albanians' belief about their own history, based on notions of isolationism and resistance}}</ref> Some scholars connect this belief with the concept of \"negotiated peripherality\".

This peripheral position also affected their national program which significance and challenges are different from those in southern Albania.<ref>{{harvnb|Galaty|2011|pp=119\u2013120|ps=:... \"negotiated peripherality\"... the idea that people living in peripheral regions exploit their... position in important, often profitable ways...

Besa is an important part of personal and familial standing and is often used as an example of \"[[Albanianism]]\". Someone who breaks his besa may even be banished from his community.\n\n== Organisation ==\n===Northern Albanians===\n[[File:The old man of Shoshi.gif|thumb|120px|The old man of [[Shoshi (region)|Shoshi]] by [[Edith Durham]].]]\nAmong [[Gheg]] Mal\u00ebsors (highlanders) the ''fis'' (clan), was headed by the oldest male and formed the basic unit of tribal society.{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|pp=30\u201331}} The ''fis'' is divided into a group of closely related houses called ''mehala'', and the house (''shpi'').

agreements.{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|p=36}}\n\nDuring the Ottoman period, the besa would be cited in government reports regarding Albanian unrest, especially in relation to the tribes.{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|p=119}} The besa formed a central place within Albanian society in relation to generating military and political power.{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|pp=119\u2013120}} Besas held Albanians together, united them and would wane when the will to enforce them dissipated.{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|p=120}} In times of revolt against the Ottomans by Albanians, the besa functioned as a link

having a Catholic majority and Muslim minority with [[Gruda (tribe)|Gruda]] evenly split between both religions.{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|pp=31\u201332}} Within Mal\u00ebsia e Madhe there were an additional seven small tribes.{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|pp=31\u201332}} During times of war and mobilisation of troops, the bajraktar (chieftain) of Hoti was recognised by the Ottoman government as leader of all forces

men that could be mobilised for war.{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|pp=31\u201332}} Shoshi had a distinction in the region of possessing a legendary rock associated with [[Lek\u00eb Dukagjini]].{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|pp=31\u201332}}\n\nThe [[Mirdita]] region which was also a large powerful devoutly Catholic tribe with 2,500 households and five bajraktars that could mobilize 5,000 irregular troops.{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|pp=31\u201332}} A general assembly of the Mirdita met often in [[Orosh]] to deliberate on important issues relating to the tribe.{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|pp=31\u201332}} The position of hereditary prince of the tribe with the title ''Prenk Pasha'' (Prince Lord) was held by the Gjonmarkaj family.{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|pp=31\u201332}} Apart from the princely family the [[Franciscan]] Abbot held some influence among the Mirdita tribesmen.{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|pp=31\u201332}}\n\nThe government estimated the military strength of Malisors in [[Sanjak of Scutari|\u0130\u015fkodra sanjak]] as numbering over 30,000 tribesmen and Ottoman officials were of the view that the highlanders could defeat Montenegro on their own with limited state assistance.{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|p=33}}\n\nIn Western Kosovo, the Gjakov\u00eb highlands contained eight tribes that were mainly Muslim and in the [[Luma (region)|Luma]] area near [[Prizren]] there were five tribes, mostly Muslim.{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|pp=34-35}} Other important tribal groupings further south include the highlanders of the [[Dibra]] region known as the \"Tigers of Dibra\".{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|pp=35-36}}\n\nAmong the many religiously mixed Catholic-Muslim tribes and one Muslim-Orthodox clan, Ottoman officials noted that tribal loyalties superseded religious affiliations.{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|pp=31\u201332}} In Catholic households there were instances of Christians who possessed four wives, marrying the first spouse in a church and the other three in the presence of an imam, while among Muslim households the Islamic tradition of circumcision was ignored.{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|pp=31\u201332}}\n\n== History ==\n===Late Ottoman period===\n\nDuring the [[Great Eastern Crisis]], Prenk Bib Doda, hereditary chieftain of Mirdita initiated a rebellion in mid-April 1877 against government control and the Ottoman Empire sent troops to put it down.{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|p=40}} Montenegro attempted to gain support from among the Malisors even though it lacked religious or ethnic links with the Albanian tribesmen.{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|p=53}} Amidst the Eastern Crisis and subsequent border negotiations Italy suggested in April 1880 for the Ottoman Empire to give Montenegro the Tuz district containing mainly Catholic Gruda and Hoti populations which would have left the tribes split between both countries.{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|p=62}} With Hoti this would have left an additional problem of tensions and instability due to the tribe having precedence by tradition over the other four tribes during peace and war.{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|p=62}} The tribes affected by the negotiations swore a besa (pledge) to resist any reduction of their lands and sent telegrams to surrounding regions for military assistance.{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|p=62}}\n\nDuring the late Ottoman period Ghegs often lacked education and integration within the Ottoman system, while they had autonomy and military capabilities.{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|p=29}} Those factors gave the area of Geg\u00ebnia an importance within the empire that differed from Tosk\u00ebria.{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|p=29}} Still many Ottoman officers thought that Ghegs, in particular the highlanders were often a liability instead of an asset for the state being commonly referred to as \"wild\" ({{lang-tr|vah\u015fi}}) or a backward people that lived in poverty and ignorance for 500 years being hostile to civilisation and progress.{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|pp=29, 120, 138}} In areas of Albania were Malisors lived, the empire only posted Ottoman officers who had prior experience of service in other tribal regions of the state like [[Kurdistan]] or [[Yemen]] that could bridge cultural divides with Gheg tribesmen.{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|p=113}}\n\n[[File:Albania Purger 13954.jpg|thumb|260px|left|Albanian Malisors in an early 20th postcard.]]\n\nSultan [[Abdul Hamid II]], Ottoman

lawlessness and economic dislocation.{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|pp=29, 118\u2013121, 138, 209}} To resolve disputes and clamp down on the practice the Ottoman state addressed the problem directly by sending Blood Feud Reconciliation Commissions (musalaha-\u0131 dem komisyonlar\u0131) that produced results with limited success.{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|p=119}} In the late Ottoman period, due to the influence of Catholic Franciscan priests some changes to blood feuding practices occurred among Albanian highlanders such as guilt being restricted to the offender or their household and even one tribe accepting the razing of the offender's home as compensation for the offense.{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|p=119}}\nOttoman officials were of the view that violence committed by Malisors in the 1880s-1890s was of a tribal nature not related to nationalism or religion.{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|p=121}} They also noted that Albanian tribesmen who identified with Islam did so in name only and lacked knowledge of the religion.{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|p=122}}\n\n[[File:Durham 2534.jpg|thumb|200px|Men of the [[Shkreli (tribe)|Shkreli tribe]] at the feast of [[Saint Nicholas]] at Bzheta in Shkreli territory, 1908.]]\nIn

(Pej\u00eb) and Prizren.{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|p=161}} The commissions sentenced Albanians who had participated in blood feud killing and the Council of Ministers allowed them to continue their work in the provinces until May 1909.{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|p=161}} After the Young Turk Revolution and subsequent restoration of the [[Ottoman constitution of 1876|Ottoman constitution]], the Hoti, Shala, Shoshi and Kastati tribes made a besa (pledge) to support the document and to stop [[Gjakmarrja|blood feuding]] with other tribes until November 6 1908.{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|p=159}} The Albanian tribes showing sentiments of enthusiasm however had little knowledge of what the constitution would do for them.{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|p=160}}\n\nDuring the Albanian revolt of 1910, Malisors such as the Shala tribe fought against Ottoman troops that were sent to quell the uprising, disarm the population by collecting guns, and replace the Law of Lek with state courts and laws.{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|p=178}} Malisors instead planned further resistance and Albanian tribes living near the border fled into Montenegro while negotiating terms with the Ottomans for their return.{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|p=178}} The Ottoman commander [[Mahmud Shevket Pasha|Mahmud Shevket]] involved in military operations concluded that the bajraktars had become Albanian nationalists and posed a danger to the empire when compared to previous uprisings.{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|p=179}}\n\nThe [[Albanian revolt of 1911]] was begun during March by Catholic Albanian tribesmen after they returned from exile in Montenegro.{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|pp=186\u2013187}} The Ottoman government sent 8,000 troops to quell the uprising and ordered that tribal chieftains would need to stand trial for leading the rebellion.{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|pp=186\u2013187}} During the revolt, [[Terenzio Tocci]], an [[Arb\u00ebresh\u00eb people|Italo-Albanian]] lawyer gathered the Mirdit\u00eb chieftains on 26/27 April 1911 in Orosh and proclaimed the independence of Albania, raised the [[flag of Albania]] and declared a provisional government.{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|p=178}} After Ottoman troops entered the area to put down the rebellion, Tocci fled the empire abandoning his activities.{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|p=186}} On 23 June 1911 Albanian Malisors and other revolutionaries gathered in Montenegro and drafted the [[Gre\u00e7\u00eb Memorandum]] demanding Albanian sociopolitical and linguistic rights with signatories being from the Hoti, Gruda, Shkreli, Kelmendi and Kastrati tribes.{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|pp=186\u2013187}} In later negotiations with the Ottomans, an amnesty was granted to the tribesmen with promises by the government to build roads and schools in tribal areas, pay wages of teachers, limit military service to the Istanbul and Shkod\u00ebr areas, right to carry weapons in the  countryside but not in urban areas, the appointment of bajraktars relatives to certain administrative positions and compensate Malisors with money and food arriving back from Montenegro.{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|pp=186\u2013187}} The final agreement was signed in [[Podgorica]] by both the Ottomans and Malisors during August 1912 and the highlanders had managed to thwart the centralist tendencies of the Young Turk government in relation to their interests.{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|pp=186\u2013187}}\n\n===Independent Albania===\nThe last tribal system of Europe located in northern Albania stayed intact until 1944 when [[Party of Labour of

depopulated.{{sfn|Elsie|2015|p=11}} Much of the population seeking a better life has moved either abroad or to Albanian cities such as Tiran\u00eb, Durr\u00ebs or Shkod\u00ebr and populations

Nearly all of ANC's video came from these stations. CONUS also maintained a small news bureau in [[Washington, D.C.]] It was the first nationwide challenger to established cable news channel [[CNN]] since the [[Satellite News Channel]] folded in 1983. From shortly after its inception until the early 1990s, All News Channel produced daily news updates that aired on [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] (at the time, owned by ANC co-parent Viacom) during the [[pay television|premium channel]]'s promo breaks. The channel also produced similar updates for [[USA Network]] from 1992 to 2000; the newsbriefs were originally produced at [[KYW-TV]] in [[Philadelphia]] (which had been producing other news services), but management and newscast changes at that station caused the network to move production. From 1991 to 1994, [[VH1]] carried All News Channel-produced interstitials during the morning block ''Hits, News & Weather''.\n\nAll News Channel was never profitable throughout its history and could not withstand the challenges of [[MSNBC]] and [[Fox News Channel]], which pushed ANC to fifth place in the ratings among all cable news channels (behind [[HLN (TV network)|Headline News]]). It benefited in part by being the only news channel on the USSB satellite service (USSB, as with ANC, was owned by Hubbard Broadcasting); after USSB merged into DirecTV, it was then one of five such channels, and it no longer had the explicit backing of its satellite provider. The channel shut down on September 30, 2002; stations that carried ANC have since replaced the channel's programming with syndicated and/or paid programming (especially common with NBC stations as the network no longer has an overnight newscast since ''[[NBC Nightside]]'' ended in 1998) or have expanded their clearance of overnight news programs supplied by their affiliated network.\n\n==Format==\nANC aired up to six live half-hour newscasts each day (airing at 4:00 a.m., 4:30 a.m. (on occasion), 8:00 a.m., 12:00 p.m., 4:00 p.m., and 10:00 p.m. [[Central Time Zone|Central Time]]), with each edition being repeated until the next live newscast aired; however, exceptions to this set scheduling were made for major breaking news stories. ANC also co-produced the syndicated morning business news program ''[[First Business]]'', before its national distribution rights were transferred to [[MGM Television]] shortly after ANC shut down.\n\nIf mistakes were made during the live broadcasts, a corrected segment would be produced (sometimes live) for the repeat broadcasts. ANC operated on a fixed schedule, where each news block ran the same length every day, and commercials (which consisted mainly of [[direct response]] advertisements, and by the mid-1990s, promos for USSB's \u2013 and later DirecTV's \u2013 slate of general entertainment and premium channels; the latter type of ads were also seen on some stations that carried the channel's programming at times) aired at the same time every day. The on-air talent was mostly exclusive to All News Channel; meteorologists from Hubbard's [[Flagship (broadcasting)|flagship station]] [[KSTP-TV]] (channel 5), the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] affiliate for the [[Minneapolis\u2013St. Paul]] market, recorded weather segments for All News Channel until 2002. Later, ANC show producers voiced their own weather segments, along with other stories.\n\nBroadcast television stations in many markets carried All News Channel programming during the overnight hours in lieu of [[sign-off|signing off]], or scheduling [[movie]]s, [[infomercial]]s or other [[syndicated programming]] to fill overnight timeslots (similar to the overnight carriage of [[HLN (TV network)|Headline News]] that was also common among stations during the same timeframe). In later years, as [[NBC]], ABC and [[CBS]] launched their own [[NBC Nightside|overnight]] [[World News Now|news]] [[Up to the Minute|programs]], ANC programming continued to air on stations affiliated with those networks as a complement to these programs and also to provide news programming in weekend time periods when network overnight newscasts were not airing. In addition, since ANC's newscasts never contained any copyrighted music (by design), stations broadcasting the ANC feed could stay on the air longer without increasing their [[ASCAP]], [[Broadcast Music Incorporated]] (BMI), and/or [[SESAC]] fees.\n\n==External links==\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKq47tEuSqw/ All News Channel video 11 Sep 2001 c. 1200 CDT]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3j_Gxo9sNg All News Channel clip 11 Sep 2001 c. 2200 CDT] \n*DAY TO DAY NEWS<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dtdeverynews.blogspot.com/|title=DAY TO DAY NEWS|last=|first=|date=|website=|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Television news in the United States}}\n{{Hubbard Broadcasting Inc.}}\n{{American broadcast television (English) defunct}}\n\n[[Category:Defunct television stations in the United States]]\n[[Category:Television channels and stations established in 1989]]\n[[Category:Television channels and stations disestablished in 2002]]\n[[Category:Hubbard Broadcasting]]\n[[Category:Former Viacom subsidiaries]]\n", "text_old": "{{Refimprove|date=April 2014}}\n{{For|The Philippine cable news channel|ABS-CBN News Channel}}\n{{Infobox television channel\n| name           = All News Channel\n| logofile       = All News Channel.svg\n| logosize       = 200px\n| logocaption    = \n| logo2          = \n| launch         = {{Start date and age|1989|1|1}}{{specify|date=September 2013}}\n| closed date    = {{End date and age|2002|9|30}}\n| picture format = [[480i]] ([[Standard-definition television|SDTV]])\n| owner          = CONUS Communications<br>([[Viacom (original)|Viacom]]/[[Hubbard Broadcasting]])\n| slogan         = ''In the Right Place[...] at the Right Time'' (1989\u20131996),<br>''News Straight from America's Hometowns'' (1996\u20132001),<br>''Real Life News for Real Life'' (2001\u20132002)\n| country        = [[United States]]\n| language       = [[English language|English]]\n| broadcast area = Nationwide\n| headquarters   = [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul, Minnesota]]\n| former names   = \n| replaced names = \n| replaced by names = \n| sister names   = [[Ovation (U.S. TV channel)|Ovation]]<br/>[[Reelz]]\n| timeshift names = \n| web            = \n}}\n\n'''All News Channel (ANC)''' was an [[United States|American]] [[satellite television]] news channel that was owned by CONUS Communications, a [[joint venture]] between [[Viacom (original)|Viacom]] and [[Hubbard Broadcasting]].

The channel shut down on September 30, 2002; stations that carried ANC have since replaced the channel's programming with syndicated and/or paid programming (especially common with NBC stations as the network no longer has an overnight newscast since ''[[NBC Nightside]]'' ended in 1998) or have expanded their clearance of overnight news programs supplied by their affiliated network.\n\n==Format==\nANC aired up to six live half-hour newscasts each day (airing at 4:00 a.m., 4:30 a.m. (on occasion), 8:00 a.m., 12:00 p.m., 4:00 p.m., and 10:00 p.m. [[Central Time Zone|Central Time]]), with each edition being repeated until the next live newscast aired; however, exceptions to this set scheduling were made for major breaking news stories. ANC also co-produced the syndicated morning business news program ''[[First Business]]'', before its national distribution rights were transferred to [[MGM Television]] shortly after ANC shut down.\n\nIf mistakes were made during the live broadcasts, a corrected segment would be produced (sometimes live) for the repeat broadcasts. ANC operated on a fixed schedule, where each news block ran the same length every day, and commercials (which consisted mainly of [[direct response]] advertisements, and by the mid-1990s, promos for USSB's \u2013 and later DirecTV's \u2013 slate of general entertainment and premium channels; the latter type of ads were also seen on some stations that carried the channel's programming at times) aired at the same time every day. The on-air talent was mostly exclusive to All News Channel; meteorologists from Hubbard's [[Flagship (broadcasting)|flagship station]] [[KSTP-TV]] (channel 5), the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] affiliate for the [[Minneapolis\u2013St. Paul]] market, recorded weather segments for All News Channel until 2002. Later, ANC show producers voiced their own weather segments, along with other stories.\n\nBroadcast television stations in many markets carried All News Channel programming during the overnight hours in lieu of [[sign-off|signing off]], or scheduling [[movie]]s, [[infomercial]]s or other [[syndicated programming]] to fill overnight timeslots (similar to the overnight carriage of [[HLN (TV network)|Headline News]] that was also common among stations during the same timeframe). In later years, as [[NBC]], ABC and [[CBS]] launched their own [[NBC Nightside|overnight]] [[World News Now|news]] [[Up to the Minute|programs]], ANC programming continued to air on stations affiliated with those networks as a complement to these programs and also to provide news programming in weekend time periods when network overnight newscasts were not airing. In addition, since ANC's newscasts never contained any copyrighted music (by design), stations broadcasting the ANC feed could stay on the air longer without increasing their [[ASCAP]], [[Broadcast Music Incorporated]] (BMI), and/or [[SESAC]] fees.\n\n==External links==\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKq47tEuSqw/ All News Channel video 11 Sep 2001 c. 1200 CDT]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3j_Gxo9sNg All News Channel clip 11 Sep 2001 c. 2200 CDT]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Television news in the United States}}\n{{Hubbard Broadcasting Inc.}}\n{{American broadcast television (English) defunct}}\n\n[[Category:Defunct television stations in the United States]]\n[[Category:Television channels and stations established in 1989]]\n[[Category:Television channels and stations disestablished in 2002]]\n[[Category:Hubbard Broadcasting]]\n[[Category:Former Viacom subsidiaries]]\n", "name_user": "DAY TO DAY NEWS", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(I have made some changes and provide some important details about news.)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_News_Channel"}

Often the performers sign up in advance for a time slot with the host or [[master of ceremonies]], typically an experienced performer or the venue manager or owner. The master of ceremonies may screen potential candidates for suitability for the venue and give individuals a time to perform in the show. These events are focused on performance arts like [[poetry]] and [[spoken word]], music (often [[singer-songwriter]]s who [[accompaniment|accompany]] themselves on guitar), and [[comedy]]. Less commonly, small groups, such as a small [[rock band]] duo/trio or a comedy duo may appear. Group performances are uncommon, because of the space and the logistics of loading in and [[soundcheck]]ing such a group. In strip club terms, '''amateur night''' is a contest for everyday women and men who compete for a cash prize by [[Striptease|taking their clothes off]] just like everyday [[strippers]].\n\nOpen mic nights may have no [[cover charge]], or a very low cover charge, although the venue may have a [[gratuity jar]] ,\"pass the hat\" for donations or hold a raffle with various prizes. Venues that have no charge make revenue from selling [[alcoholic beverage]]s and food. The performers are not typically paid, although the venue may recompense the performers with a beverage or meal. The host or MC, as an experienced professional, is usually paid for their services. The host or MC may perform at some point during the evening, either a full set or to fill in when an amateur member is not available for their slot. Open mic events are somewhat related to [[jam session]]s, in that in both cases amateur performers are given the opportunity to sing or play instruments. The difference is that jam sessions often involve musical ensembles, possibly even a [[house band]] or [[rhythm section]] and a jam session may involve the participation of professional performers, especially at a high-end [[jazz club]].\n\n==Poetry and spoken word==\nPoetry and spoken word open mics feature a host, who is normally a [[poet]] or spoken word artist, poets and spoken word artists, and audience members. A sign-up is done before the show begins, so that the host has a list of names to call from. Some spoken word artists use [[pseudonym]]s or [[stage name]]s when they perform. Poetry/spoken word open mics range from laid back, serene settings to lively sessions where readers and/or performers compete for audience applause. They are usually held in libraries, [[coffee house]]s, cafes, bookstores and bars.\n\nEach poet or spoken word artist is often asked to keep their performances to a minimum/specified time slot, giving each performer enough time to share some of their work with the audience. The host or MC acts as a \"gatekeeper\", determining which performers are suitable for the event. If a performer goes over their time limit, the host diplomatically thanks the performer for their contribution and asks them to yield the stage for the next performer.\n\n==Comedy==\n[[Stand-up comedy]] open mic nights can be held at established [[comedy club]]s, but they are more commonly held at other venues with or without a stage, often the upstairs or back room of a pub or bar,<ref>{{cite book\n |last=Durham\n |first=Rob\n |year=2011\n |title=Don\u2019t Wear Shorts on Stage: the stand-up guide to comedy\n |location=Middletown, DE\n |page=16\n |isbn=9781468004847\n |quote=Each comedy club or bar has its own system for signing up for [an] open mic.}}</ref> bookstores, colleges, rock clubs, and coffeehouses.<ref>{{cite book\n |last=Carter\n |first=Judy\n |year=2001\n |title=The Comedy Bible: From Stand-up to Sitcom\u2014The Comedy Writer\u2019s Ultimate How-To Guide\n |location=New York, NY\n |publisher=Simon & Schuster\n |pages=66\u201367\n |isbn=978-0-7432-0125-4}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n |url=https://www.thoughtco.com/how-to-break-into-stand-up-comedy-801153\n |title=How to Break Into Stand-Up Comedy\n |last= Bromley\n |first=Patrick\n |date=6 June 2018\n |website=ThoughtCo.\n |publisher=Potdash\n |access-date=22 March 2019\n |quote=[Open mics] could be held anywhere, but are often found at bars, rock clubs, and coffee houses.\n}}</ref> They are also held in uncommon areas such as strip clubs<ref>{{cite web\n |url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/7xdg9z/comedians-tell-us-the-most-epic-fails-theyve-seen-at-open-mics\n |title=Comedians Tell Us the Most Epic Fails They've Seen at Open Mics\n |last=Isador\n |first=Graham\n |date=2 May 2018\n |website=VICE\n |publisher=VICE MEDIA LLC\n |access-date=18 February 2019\n |quote=The worst open mic I ever attended was at Zanzibar, a strip club in downtown Toronto.}}</ref> and comic book shops.<ref>{{cite web\n |url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/bnpqa4/first-person-shooter-an-aspiring-stand-up-comic-shoots-empty-open-mics-across-nyc\n |title=An Aspiring Stand-Up Comic Shoots Empty Open Mics Across NYC\n |last=Master\n |first=Julian\n |date=2 April 2016\n |website=VICE\n |publisher=VICE MEDIA LLC\n |access-date=18 February 2019}}</ref> Such nights give newer or emerging comedians an opportunity to practice and improve,<ref>{{cite web\n |url=https://www.thoughtco.com/tips-for-beginner-stand-up-comedians-801155\n |title=Breaking Into Stand-Up: 10 Tips for Beginner Comedians\n |last= Bromley\n |first=Patrick\n |date=13 April 2018\n |website=ThoughtCo.\n |publisher=Potdash\n |access-date=22 March 2019\n |quote=It's a true \u2018learn-by-doing\u2019 art form, and you won't know what works (and what doesn't) until you've gotten on stage in front of an audience.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n |url=https://www.dispatch.com/entertainmentlife/20190321/budding-established-comedians-hone-craft-at-open-mic-nights\n |title=Budding, established comedians hone craft at open-mic nights\n |last=Lagatta\n |first=Eric\n |date=21 March 2019\n |website=The Columbus Dispatch\n |publisher=GateHouse Media, LLC.\u00a0\n |access-date=25 March 2019\n |quote=Most comedians see open-mic nights as a chance to test new material or refine their stage presence.}}</ref> with a view to getting paid work in the future.

Prior to their popularity, the only outlet generally were [[folk clubs]], which were not always friendly towards creators of new music, preferring traditional, well-known music. They also suggested that music performed by [[acoustic music]]ians or solo artists in this manner would necessarily be folk music, a misconception that still commonly exists today. Some organizers have chosen the title \"acoustic night\" or \"acoustic club\" in an attempt to indicate an event run broadly on the lines of a folk club, but with a much wider range of musical styles.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nOpen mic events are most commonly held in the middle of the week or at the very end of the weekend when footfall through venues is low.

In this format a bar or club will dedicate a particular night, usually in the middle of the week, as being \"open mic blues night\".  The establishment may supply a [[house band]], typically guitar, bass and drums, sometimes a [[keyboard instrument|keyboard]]. Singers, guitarists, harmonica performers who wish to play sign up, usually with the master-of-ceremonies or host. This person is tasked with screening the performers, choosing and ordering, and getting the performers on and off stage in a polite manner.\n\nSince the songs chosen need to be simple enough so that a band of musicians who have not played together can perform them without practice, blues standards are used.  Songs might be announced as a \"12-bar fast shuffle in C\" or \"slow 12-bar blues in F\", or similar phrases, that should be familiar to all concerned. Lead singers, keyboards, horn players, (usually saxophones) and various percussion instruments are common additions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rayrayblues.com/bluesjams/|title=Phoenix Blues Jams|first=|last=rayray|website=www.rayrayblues.com}}</ref>\n\n==Strip club==\nIn most strip clubs, amateur night is a contest held by the clubs themselves where women and men compete for cash by stripping just like their stripper counterparts.<ref>[http://www.scorestampa.com/blog/2015/02/01/want-to-be-a-stripper]</ref><ref>[http://www.stripclubs-of-las-vegas.com/deja-vu-showgirls-strip-club-review.html]</ref>\n\n==Rarer niche variations==\nThe terms \"open deck\" (where ''deck'' refers to the kind of [[Phonograph|turntable]] used by a [[DJ]]) and \"open reel\" (where ''reel'' refers to a [[35mm movie film|35 mm film]] reel) are used for more niche open mic events where keen amateurs can meet to exhibit and [[critique]] their skills/artform.

Often the performers sign up in advance for a time slot with the host or [[master of ceremonies]], typically an experienced performer or the venue manager or owner. The master of ceremonies may screen potential candidates for suitability for the venue and give individuals a time to perform in the show. These events are focused on performance arts like [[poetry]] and [[spoken word]], music (often [[singer-songwriter]]s who [[accompaniment|accompany]] themselves on guitar), and [[comedy]]. Less commonly, small groups, such as a small [[rock band]] duo/trio or a comedy duo may appear. Group performances are uncommon, because of the space and the logistics of loading in and [[soundcheck]]ing such a group. In strip club terms, '''amateur night''' is a contest for everyday women and men who compete for a cash prize by [[Striptease|taking their clothes off]] just like everyday [[strippers]].\n\nOpen mic nights may have no [[cover charge]], or a very low cover charge, although the venue may have a [[gratuity jar]] ,\"pass the hat\" for donations or hold a raffle with various prizes. Venues that have no charge make revenue from selling [[alcoholic beverage]]s and food. The performers are not typically paid, although the venue may recompense the performers with a beverage or meal. The host or MC, as an experienced professional, is usually paid for their services. The host or MC may perform at some point during the evening, either a full set or to fill in when an amateur member is not available for their slot. Open mic events are somewhat related to [[jam session]]s, in that in both cases amateur performers are given the opportunity to sing or play instruments. The difference is that jam sessions often involve musical ensembles, possibly even a [[house band]] or [[rhythm section]] and a jam session may involve the participation of professional performers, especially at a high-end [[jazz club]].\n\n==Poetry and spoken word==\nPoetry and spoken word open mics feature a host, who is normally a [[poet]] or spoken word artist, poets and spoken word artists, and audience members. A sign-up is done before the show begins, so that the host has a list of names to call from. Some spoken word artists use [[pseudonym]]s or [[stage name]]s when they perform. Poetry/spoken word open mics range from laid back, serene settings to lively sessions where readers and/or performers compete for audience applause. They are usually held in libraries, [[coffee house]]s, cafes, bookstores and bars.\n\nEach poet or spoken word artist is often asked to keep their performances to a minimum/specified time slot, giving each performer enough time to share some of their work with the audience. The host or MC acts as a \"gatekeeper\", determining which performers are suitable for the event. If a performer goes over their time limit, the host diplomatically thanks the performer for their contribution and asks them to yield the stage for the next performer.\n\n==Comedy==\n[[Stand-up comedy]] open mic nights can be held at established [[comedy club]]s, but they are more commonly held at other venues with or without a stage, often the upstairs or back room of a pub or bar,<ref>{{cite book\n |last=Durham\n |first=Rob\n |year=2011\n |title=Don\u2019t Wear Shorts on Stage: the stand-up guide to comedy\n |location=Middletown, DE\n |page=16\n |isbn=9781468004847\n |quote=Each comedy club or bar has its own system for signing up for [an] open mic.}}</ref> bookstores, colleges, rock clubs, and coffeehouses.<ref>{{cite book\n |last=Carter\n |first=Judy\n |year=2001\n |title=The Comedy Bible: From Stand-up to Sitcom\u2014The Comedy Writer\u2019s Ultimate How-To Guide\n |location=New York, NY\n |publisher=Simon & Schuster\n |pages=66\u201367\n |isbn=978-0-7432-0125-4}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n |url=https://www.thoughtco.com/how-to-break-into-stand-up-comedy-801153\n |title=How to Break Into Stand-Up Comedy\n |last= Bromley\n |first=Patrick\n |date=6 June 2018\n |website=ThoughtCo.\n |publisher=Potdash\n |access-date=22 March 2019\n |quote=[Open mics] could be held anywhere, but are often found at bars, rock clubs, and coffee houses.\n}}</ref> They are also held in uncommon areas such as strip clubs<ref>{{cite web\n |url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/7xdg9z/comedians-tell-us-the-most-epic-fails-theyve-seen-at-open-mics\n |title=Comedians Tell Us the Most Epic Fails They've Seen at Open Mics\n |last=Isador\n |first=Graham\n |date=2 May 2018\n |website=VICE\n |publisher=VICE MEDIA LLC\n |access-date=18 February 2019\n |quote=The worst open mic I ever attended was at Zanzibar, a strip club in downtown Toronto.}}</ref> and comic book shops.<ref>{{cite web\n |url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/bnpqa4/first-person-shooter-an-aspiring-stand-up-comic-shoots-empty-open-mics-across-nyc\n |title=An Aspiring Stand-Up Comic Shoots Empty Open Mics Across NYC\n |last=Master\n |first=Julian\n |date=2 April 2016\n |website=VICE\n |publisher=VICE MEDIA LLC\n |access-date=18 February 2019}}</ref> Such nights give newer or emerging comedians an opportunity to practice and improve,<ref>{{cite web\n |url=https://www.thoughtco.com/tips-for-beginner-stand-up-comedians-801155\n |title=Breaking Into Stand-Up: 10 Tips for Beginner Comedians\n |last= Bromley\n |first=Patrick\n |date=13 April 2018\n |website=ThoughtCo.\n |publisher=Potdash\n |access-date=22 March 2019\n |quote=It's a true \u2018learn-by-doing\u2019 art form, and you won't know what works (and what doesn't) until you've gotten on stage in front of an audience.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n |url=https://www.dispatch.com/entertainmentlife/20190321/budding-established-comedians-hone-craft-at-open-mic-nights\n |title=Budding, established comedians hone craft at open-mic nights\n |last=Lagatta\n |first=Eric\n |date=21 March 2019\n |website=The Columbus Dispatch\n |publisher=GateHouse Media, LLC.\u00a0\n |access-date=25 March 2019\n |quote=Most comedians see open-mic nights as a chance to test new material or refine their stage presence.}}</ref> with a view to getting paid work in the future.

Prior to their popularity, the only outlet generally were [[folk clubs]], which were not always friendly towards creators of new music, preferring traditional, well-known music. They also suggested that music performed by [[acoustic music]]ians or solo artists in this manner would necessarily be folk music, a misconception that still commonly exists today. Some organizers have chosen the title \"acoustic night\" or \"acoustic club\" in an attempt to indicate an event run broadly on the lines of a folk club, but with a much wider range of musical styles.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nOpen mic events are most commonly held in the middle of the week or at the very end of the weekend when footfall through venues is low.

The letter purported to be a directive from [[Grigory Zinoviev]], the head of the [[Communist International]] (Comintern) in Moscow, to the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]], ordering it to engage in seditious activities. It said the resumption of diplomatic relations (by a [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] government) would hasten the radicalisation of the British working class.

However, it was a [[minority government]] and was liable to fall if the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] and [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberals]] combined against it.

The Conservatives were returned decisively, gaining 155 seats, making a total of 413 Members of Parliament. Labour lost 40 seats, retaining 151. The Liberals lost 118 seats, leaving them with only 40, and their vote count fell by over a million. The real significance of the election was that the Liberals\u2014whom Labour had displaced as the second-largest political party in 1922\u2014were now clearly a minor party.\n\nA 1967 British study deemed that the Labour Party was destined for defeat in October 1924 in any event, and argues that the primary effect of the purported Comintern communication was upon Anglo-Soviet relations:\n{{quote|Under Baldwin, the British Government led the diplomatic retreat from Moscow. Soviet Russia became more isolated, and, of necessity, more isolationist. [...]\n\nThe Zinoviev letter hardened attitudes, and hardened them at a time when the Soviet Union was becoming more amenable to diplomatic contact with the capitalist world. The proponents of world revolution were being superseded by more pliant subscribers to the [[Joseph Stalin|Stalinist]] philosophy of \"[[Socialism in One Country|Building Socialism in One Country]]\". Thus, after successfully weathering all the early contradictions in Soviet Diplomacy, Britain gave up when the going was about to become much easier. And it gave up largely because the two middle-class parties suddenly perceived that their short-term electoral advantage was best served by a violent anti-Bolshevik campaign.<ref>Lewis Chester, Steven Fay, and Hugo Young, ''The Zinoviev Letter: A Political Intrigue.''

The authors, Lewis Chester, Steven Fay and [[Hugo Young]], asserted that two members of a Russian [[monarchist]] organisation called the [[Brotherhood of Saint George (Russian)|Brotherhood of St. George]] composed the document in Berlin. Irina Bellegarde, the widow of [[Alexis Bellegarde]], one of the two men said to have written the document, provided the authors with direct testimony that she had witnessed the forgery as it was performed.<ref>Chester, Fay, and Young, ''The Zinoviev Letter'', pp. 51\u201352.</ref> She said that her husband had drafted the letter after fellow-\u00e9migr\u00e9 Alexander Gumansky told him that a request to forge the letter had come from \"a person in authority in London\".

He had been an important source on Soviet matters for the [[Secret Intelligence Service]] (SIS; known as MI6) before the war, raising the possibility that he already had links to British intelligence when involved with the Zinoviev letter.<ref name=outcast>[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/10/outcast-mi6-agent-zinoviev-letter-alexis-bellegarde The Observer newspaper: Revealed: the dark past of \u2018Outcast\u2019, MI6\u2019s top wartime double agent, 11 October 2015].</ref>\n\nThe authors are said to have studied Bolshevik documents and signatures extensively before creating a sensational document in an effort to undermine the Soviet regime's relations with the United Kingdom. The British [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|Foreign Office]] had received the forgery on 10 October 1924, two days after the defeat of the MacDonald government on a confidence motion put forward by the Liberals.<ref>Chester, Fay, and Young, ''The Zinoviev Letter'', p. 65.</ref> Despite the dubious nature of the document, wheels were set in motion for its publication, members of the Conservative Party combining with Foreign Office officials in what Chester, Fay, and Young characterised as a \"conspiracy.\"<ref>Chester, Fay, and Young, ''The Zinoviev Letter'', pp. 65\u201381.</ref>\n\nThis book motivated the British Foreign Office to initiate a study of their own. For three years, [[Milicent Bagot]] of MI5 examined the archives and conducted interviews with surviving witnesses. She produced a long account of the affair, but the paper ultimately proved unpublishable because of its containing sensitive operational and personnel information.<ref name=\"Bennett pg. 2\"/> Nevertheless, Bagot's work proved important as a [[secondary source]] when the Foreign Office revisited the matter nearly three decades later.\n\nEarly in 1998, reports of a forthcoming book allegedly containing revelations about the origins of the Zinoviev letter, based on information from Soviet archives, led to renewed press speculation and parliamentary questions.<ref>The book in question was Nigel West and Oleg Tsarev's ''The Crown Jewels: The British Secrets at the Heart of the KGB Archives'', published by HarperCollins in 1998.</ref> In response, British [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] [[Robin Cook]] announced on 12 February 1998 that, in the interests of openness, he had commissioned the historians of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to prepare a historical memorandum on the Zinoviev letter, drawing upon archival documents.\n\nA paper by the Chief Historian of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, [[Gill Bennett]], was published in January 1999 and contains the results of this inquiry. Bennett had free and unfettered access to the archives of the Foreign Office, as well as those of the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS) and MI5. She also visited Moscow in the course of her research, working in the archives of the Executive Committee of the Communist International, the Central Committee of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] and the Comintern archive of the Communist Party of Great Britain.<ref>Bennett, ''A Most Extraordinary and Mysterious Business,'' pp. 2\u20133.</ref> Although not every operational detail could be published because of British secrecy laws, Bennett's paper was a detailed account of the Zinoviev letter affair. Her report showed that the letter contained statements similar to those made by Zinoviev to other communist parties and at other times to the CPGB, but at the time of the letter (when Anglo-Soviet trade talks were taking place and a general election was impending), Zinoviev and the Soviet State were being more restrained towards the British.  Despite her extensive research, she concluded \"it is impossible to say who wrote the Zinoviev Letter\", though her best guess was that it was commissioned by White Russian intelligence circles from forgers in Berlin or the Baltic states, most likely in [[Riga]].

The Conservatives were returned decisively, gaining 155 seats, making a total of 413 Members of Parliament. Labour lost 40 seats, retaining 151. The Liberals lost 118 seats, leaving them with only 40, and their vote count fell by over a million. The real significance of the election was that the Liberals\u2014whom Labour had displaced as the second-largest political party in 1922\u2014were now clearly a minor party.\n\nA 1967 British study deemed that the Labour Party was destined for defeat in October 1924 in any event, and argues that the primary effect of the purported Comintern communication was upon Anglo-Soviet relations:\n{{quote|Under Baldwin, the British Government led the diplomatic retreat from Moscow. Soviet Russia became more isolated, and, of necessity, more isolationist. [...]\n\nThe Zinoviev letter hardened attitudes, and hardened them at a time when the Soviet Union was becoming more amenable to diplomatic contact with the capitalist world. The proponents of world revolution were being superseded by more pliant subscribers to the [[Joseph Stalin|Stalinist]] philosophy of \"[[Socialism in One Country|Building Socialism in One Country]]\". Thus, after successfully weathering all the early contradictions in Soviet Diplomacy, Britain gave up when the going was about to become much easier. And it gave up largely because the two middle-class parties suddenly perceived that their short-term electoral advantage was best served by a violent anti-Bolshevik campaign.<ref>Lewis Chester, Steven Fay, and Hugo Young, ''The Zinoviev Letter: A Political Intrigue.''

The authors, Lewis Chester, Steven Fay and [[Hugo Young]], asserted that two members of a Russian [[monarchist]] organisation called the [[Brotherhood of Saint George (Russian)|Brotherhood of St. George]] composed the document in Berlin. Irina Bellegarde, the widow of [[Alexis Bellegarde]], one of the two men said to have written the document, provided the authors with direct testimony that she had witnessed the forgery as it was performed.<ref>Chester, Fay, and Young, ''The Zinoviev Letter'', pp. 51\u201352.</ref> She said that her husband had drafted the letter after fellow-\u00e9migr\u00e9 Alexander Gumansky told him that a request to forge the letter had come from \"a person in authority in London\". Gurmansky and Bellegarde were later sentenced to death ''[[Trial in absentia|in absentia]]'' by a Soviet court.<ref name=outcast/> Bellegarde was later forced to work during the [[World War II|Second World War]] for the Russian section of the [[Abwehr]] (German military intelligence) in Berlin; there is evidence that he was the very effective British [[double agent]] known as \"Outcast\". He had been an important source on Soviet matters for the [[Secret Intelligence Service]] (SIS; known as MI6) before the war, raising the possibility that he already had links to British intelligence when involved with the Zinoviev letter.<ref name=outcast>[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/10/outcast-mi6-agent-zinoviev-letter-alexis-bellegarde The Observer newspaper: Revealed: the dark past of \u2018Outcast\u2019, MI6\u2019s top wartime double agent, 11 October 2015].</ref>\n\nThe authors are said to have studied Bolshevik documents and signatures extensively before creating a sensational document in an effort to undermine the Soviet regime's relations with the United Kingdom. The British [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|Foreign Office]] had received the forgery on 10 October 1924, two days after the defeat of the MacDonald government on a confidence motion put forward by the Liberals.<ref>Chester, Fay, and Young, ''The Zinoviev Letter'', p. 65.</ref> Despite the dubious nature of the document, wheels were set in motion for its publication, members of the Conservative Party combining with Foreign Office officials in what Chester, Fay, and Young characterised as a \"conspiracy.\"<ref>Chester, Fay, and Young, ''The Zinoviev Letter'', pp. 65\u201381.</ref>\n\nThis book motivated the British Foreign Office to initiate a study of their own. For three years, [[Milicent Bagot]] of MI5 examined the archives and conducted interviews with surviving witnesses. She produced a long account of the affair, but the paper ultimately proved unpublishable because of its containing sensitive operational and personnel information.<ref name=\"Bennett pg. 2\"/> Nevertheless, Bagot's work proved important as a [[secondary source]] when the Foreign Office revisited the matter nearly three decades later.\n\nEarly in 1998, reports of a forthcoming book allegedly containing revelations about the origins of the Zinoviev letter, based on information from Soviet archives, led to renewed press speculation and parliamentary questions.<ref>The book in question was Nigel West and Oleg Tsarev's ''The Crown Jewels: The British Secrets at the Heart of the KGB Archives'', published by HarperCollins in 1998.</ref> In response, British [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] [[Robin Cook]] announced on 12 February 1998 that, in the interests of openness, he had commissioned the historians of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to prepare a historical memorandum on the Zinoviev letter, drawing upon archival documents.\n\nA paper by the Chief Historian of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, [[Gill Bennett]], was published in January 1999 and contains the results of this inquiry. Bennett had free and unfettered access to the archives of the Foreign Office, as well as those of the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS) and MI5. She also visited Moscow in the course of her research, working in the archives of the Executive Committee of the Communist International, the Central Committee of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] and the Comintern archive of the Communist Party of Great Britain.<ref>Bennett, ''A Most Extraordinary and Mysterious Business,'' pp. 2\u20133.</ref> Although not every operational detail could be published because of British secrecy laws, Bennett's paper was a detailed account of the Zinoviev letter affair. Her report showed that the letter contained statements similar to those made by Zinoviev to other communist parties and at other times to the CPGB, but at the time of the letter (when Anglo-Soviet trade talks were taking place and a general election was impending), Zinoviev and the Soviet State were being more restrained towards the British.  Despite her extensive research, she concluded \"it is impossible to say who wrote the Zinoviev Letter\", though her best guess was that it was commissioned by White Russian intelligence circles from forgers in Berlin or the Baltic states, most likely in [[Riga]]. It was then leaked to the papers probably by SIS and that \"I have my doubts as to whether [Desmond Morton] thought it was genuine but he treated it as if it was.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1999/feb/04/uk.politicalnews6|title=Zinoviev letter was dirty trick by MI6|last=Norton-Taylor|first=By Richard|date=4 February 1999|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-10-17|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>\n\nIn 2006, Bennett incorporated some of her findings on the Zinoviev letter into chapter four of her biography of SIS agent [[Desmond Morton (civil servant)|Desmond Morton]].<ref>{{cite book |first=Gill |last=Bennett |title=Churchill's Man of Mystery: Desmond Morton and the World of Intelligence |location=London |publisher=[[Taylor & Francis]] |date=18 October 2006 |isbn=978-0415394307}}</ref> <!--somebody needs to examine this book if they get a chance.--> Another 2006 book on [[espionage|spycraft]] attributes authorship to [[Vladimir Orlov (intelligence agent)|Vladimir Orlov]], a former intelligence agent of [[Pyotr Nikolayevich Wrangel|Baron Wrangel]] during the [[Russian Civil War]].<ref>Nigel West, ''At Her Majesty's Secret Service: The Chiefs of Britain's Intelligence Agency, MI6.''

The specific rules such as the [[tax rate]] of entertainment tax and cases of [[tax exemption]] are subject to local authorities, as is their collection. The entertainment tax has in the most cases the form of [[indirect tax]], which is levied on buyer. Nowadays, the most discussed subject of those taxes are their implementations to online services, especially the ones working on streaming basis such as [[Netflix]], [[Spotify]] and others.\n\n==India==\nIn [[India]], Entertainment Tax is a tax imposed by the government on [[feature films]] getting a wide release in the country and are reduced from gross collections, major commercial shows and big private festivals. The amount after deducting entertainment tax is known as [[Net (economics)|net]].\n\nIn [[Delhi]], movie tickets, large commercial shows and large private festival celebrations may incur an entertainment tax.<ref>[http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2012-02-11/news/31050052_1_box-office-collection-khans-entertainment-tax/ Business of Bollywood: Why Rs 100 crore is the Biggest Star in Bollywood]</ref>\n\nEntertainment falls in List 2 of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India and is exclusively reserved as a revenue source for the state governments. Historically, before India acquired independence, British government imposed heavy taxes on the events of amusements and entertainment, where a large gathering of Indians could have caused rebellion or mutiny. Thus, various entertainment tax acts of the state governments permit the rate of tax beyond{{Clarify|date=April 2009}} 100%. After independence, old enactments continued and there has been no revision or repeal of these acts.\n\nThis source of revenue has grown with the advent of pay television services in India. Since, entertainment is being provided through the services such as broadcasting services, DTH Services, Pay TV Services, cable services, etc. The component of entertainment is intrinsically intertwined in the transaction of service, that it can not be separated from the whole transaction. Given the nature of transaction of service, it is being subjected to tax by the Union and the State governments both.\n\nThe fiscal principle underlying article 246 of the constitution of India separates the sources of taxation for the Union and the States and also maintains the exclusivity. This article also provides that in case of conflict between the powers of Union and the States, the Union power to tax shall supersede the power of the State to levy tax on the taxable event or in relation to the subject or object of taxation. Entertainment tax structure in India varies across states and is the highest in Uttar Pradesh at 60 per cent. In Maharashtra, entertainment tax was reduced by five per cent in 2005 and now stands at 45 per cent. There is no tax for Marathi films in Maharashtra, and in Tamil Nadu, Tamil films are tax free if they have a Tamil title and a U certificate from the Censor Board. Failing any of these, films are imposed a 15% tax.\n\nThe entertainment industry in India is facing the challenge of [[double taxation]] on such transactions.<ref>http://www.thehindu.com/news/states/kerala/expanded-tax-regime-opposed/article4313280.ece</ref>\nNo State Entertainment Tax Applicable on Gross Tkt Value .\n# Andhra Pradesh - 20% (15% for Telugu Films) \n# Assam, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, Rajasthan, Punjab and Uttaranchal (Nil) \n# Bihar - 50.00%  \n# Delhi- 20.00%  \n# Gujarat -20.00% (Nil for Gujrati Films) \n# Haryana -30.00%  \n# Jharkhand -110% (Nil for Jharkhand Films)  \n# Karnataka -30% (Nil for Kannada Films) \n# Kerala- 30.00%  \n# Madhya Pradesh -20.00%  \n# Maharashtra -45% (Nil for Marathi Films) \n# Orissa -25.00%  \n# Tamil Nadu -15% (Nil for Tamil Films)  \n# Uttar Pradesh -30% to 40%  \n# West Bengal- 30% (2% for Bengali Films) \n\n===Maharashtra Entertainment Duty Act, 1923===\nThe Maharashtra government imposed an additional 10 percent entertainment duty on movie tickets priced between Rs.251 and Rs.350 from January 16, 2013.

It is assigned to section 4-156 in Chicago municipal code. In 1999 the tax rate for middle-sized (750-5,000 people) events was reduced to 3%. Although, the first major amendment was in July 2004 where the original concept was enlarged by above mentioned paid television programmes and paid membership activities. The largest and nowadays most discussed amendment came into effect on 1 July 2015. It introduced a general 9% tax rate with exception for registered reseller for whom the rate is 3% and since 2018 the rate was decreased to 5% for cultural performances which are held in auditoriums with maximum capacity exceeding 750 persons. This rule was changed later that year and now there is total exemption from the tax if the event is live performance and the capacity is less than 1,500 persons.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.chicago.gov/content/dam/city/depts/rev/supp_info/TaxSupportingInformation/AmusementTaxGeneralInfo-UpdatedFor2018.pdf |title=IS YOUR EVENT SUBJECT TO THE CHICAGO AMUSEMENT TAX? |work=[[City of Chicago]] |author=Department of Finance, Chicago |accessdate=30 April 2019}}</ref> However, the controversy part of this amendment was including the digital streaming and online entertainment platforms as well (Netflix, Spotify, etc.), this expansion is often referred to as \"Netflix tax\" or \"Cloud tax\".

The specific rules such as the [[tax rate]] of entertainment tax and cases of [[tax exemption]] are subject to local authorities, as is their collection. The entertainment tax has in the most cases the form of [[indirect tax]], which is levied on buyer. Nowadays, the most discussed subject of those taxes are their implementations to online services, especially the ones working on streaming basis such as [[Netflix]], [[Spotify]] and others.\n\n==India==\nIn [[India]], Entertainment Tax is a tax imposed by the government on [[feature films]] getting a wide release in the country and are reduced from gross collections, major commercial shows and big private festivals. The amount after deducting entertainment tax is known as [[Net (economics)|net]].\n\nIn [[Delhi]], movie tickets, large commercial shows and large private festival celebrations may incur an entertainment tax.<ref>[http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2012-02-11/news/31050052_1_box-office-collection-khans-entertainment-tax/ Business of Bollywood: Why Rs 100 crore is the Biggest Star in Bollywood]</ref>\n\nEntertainment falls in List 2 of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India and is exclusively reserved as a revenue source for the state governments. Historically, before India acquired independence, British government imposed heavy taxes on the events of amusements and entertainment, where a large gathering of Indians could have caused rebellion or mutiny. Thus, various entertainment tax acts of the state governments permit the rate of tax beyond{{Clarify|date=April 2009}} 100%. After independence, old enactments continued and there has been no revision or repeal of these acts.\n\nThis source of revenue has grown with the advent of pay television services in India. Since, entertainment is being provided through the services such as broadcasting services, DTH Services, Pay TV Services, cable services, etc. The component of entertainment is intrinsically intertwined in the transaction of service, that it can not be separated from the whole transaction. Given the nature of transaction of service, it is being subjected to tax by the Union and the State governments both.\n\nThe fiscal principle underlying article 246 of the constitution of India separates the sources of taxation for the Union and the States and also maintains the exclusivity. This article also provides that in case of conflict between the powers of Union and the States, the Union power to tax shall supersede the power of the State to levy tax on the taxable event or in relation to the subject or object of taxation. Entertainment tax structure in India varies across states and is the highest in Uttar Pradesh at 60 per cent. In Maharashtra, entertainment tax was reduced by five per cent in 2005 and now stands at 45 per cent. There is no tax for Marathi films in Maharashtra, and in Tamil Nadu, Tamil films are tax free if they have a Tamil title and a U certificate from the Censor Board. Failing any of these, films are imposed a 15% tax.\n\nThe entertainment industry in India is facing the challenge of [[double taxation]] on such transactions.<ref>http://www.thehindu.com/news/states/kerala/expanded-tax-regime-opposed/article4313280.ece</ref>\nNo State Entertainment Tax Applicable on Gross Tkt Value .\n# Andhra Pradesh - 20% (15% for Telugu Films) \n# Assam, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, Rajasthan, Punjab and Uttaranchal (Nil) \n# Bihar - 50.00%  \n# Delhi- 20.00%  \n# Gujarat -20.00% (Nil for Gujrati Films) \n# Haryana -30.00%  \n# Jharkhand -110% (Nil for Jharkhand Films)  \n# Karnataka -30% (Nil for Kannada Films) \n# Kerala- 30.00%  \n# Madhya Pradesh -20.00%  \n# Maharashtra -45% (Nil for Marathi Films) \n# Orissa -25.00%  \n# Tamil Nadu -15% (Nil for Tamil Films)  \n# Uttar Pradesh -30% to 40%  \n# West Bengal- 30% (2% for Bengali Films) \n\n===Maharashtra Entertainment Duty Act, 1923===\nThe Maharashtra government imposed an additional 10 percent entertainment duty on movie tickets priced between Rs.251 and Rs.350 from January 16, 2013.

The new tax slab is somewhat like this: If a multiplex or theatre owner charges up to Rs 250 per ticket, he will not have to pay any additional surcharge.\n \nIf a ticket is priced between Rs 251 and Rs 350, the theatre or multiplex owner will be charged 10 per cent more; if a ticket is priced between Rs 351 and Rs 500, the owner will have to pay 15 per cent more, and if the ticket is priced more than Rs 501, the charge will be 20 per cent more.

Nowadays, the amusement tax is levied on cultural events (performances, exhibitions, etc.), commercial events (promotional shows, presentations), sport events of any kind (car races, tennis, horse-races, etc.), entertainment activities for public participation or attended based on paid membership (sport clubs, etc.) and virtually provided amusement services (paid television programmes, etc.) based on streaming basis.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.chicago.gov/content/dam/city/depts/rev/supp_info/TaxRulingsandRegulations/AmusementTaxRuling5-06092015.pdf |title=City of Chicago :: Amusement Tax Ruling 5 Effective 7-1-2015 |work=[[City of Chicago]] |author=Department of finance, Chicago |accessdate=30 April 2019}}</ref> The general exemptions are events with religious purposes, events to support the veterans and generally all non-profiting events. The City of Chicago offers at their online site templates for amusement providers to be filled as well as complete guide regarding the amusement tax and the liabilities.\n\n===Amendments===\nThe amusement tax in Chicago has been in effect since 17 February 1986 and has gone through several amendments. It is assigned to section 4-156 in Chicago municipal code. In 1999 the tax rate for middle-sized (750-5,000 people) events was reduced to 3%. Although, the first major amendment was in July 2004 where the original concept was enlarged by above mentioned paid television programmes and paid membership activities. The largest and nowadays most discussed amendment came into effect on 1 July 2015. It introduced a general 9% tax rate with exception for registered reseller for whom the rate is 3% and since 2018 the rate was decreased to 5% for cultural performances which are held in auditoriums with maximum capacity exceeding 750 persons. This rule was changed later that year and now there is total exemption from the tax if the event is live performance and the capacity is less than 1,500 persons.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.chicago.gov/content/dam/city/depts/rev/supp_info/TaxSupportingInformation/AmusementTaxGeneralInfo-UpdatedFor2018.pdf |title=IS YOUR EVENT SUBJECT TO THE CHICAGO AMUSEMENT TAX? |work=[[City of Chicago]] |author=Department of Finance, Chicago |accessdate=30 April 2019}}</ref> However, the controversy part of this amendment was including the digital streaming and online entertainment platforms as well (Netflix, Spotify, etc.), this expansion is often referred to as \"Netflix tax\" or \"Cloud tax\". However, this affects only temporary services, e.g. the music tracks, movies, games and other online goods bought online and downloaded permanently are not subject to this tax (it is subject to digital sales tax, which in the state of Illinois is equal to 6.25%).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.taxjar.com/states/illinois-sales-tax-online/#how-to-file-sales-tax-in-illinois |title=Illinois Sales Tax Guide for Businesses |work=[[www.taxjar.com]] |accessdate=30 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Controversy===\nThe new enlargement for \"Netflix tax\" was predicted to bring $12 million to the treasury of the city and help to decrease the city's budget deficit which was in 2016 around $500 million. However, the new amusement tax is subject to widespread criticism because of violations of other federal laws, state laws and precedent of the Supreme Court. Besides what is mentioned above, this taxation also violates the Internet Tax Freedom Act on the Federal level and the Commerce Clause. As for the State level, the Department of Finance executives are in clash with Illinois' executives and the uniformity of requirements is therefore not existing.\n   \n==Malta==\nEntertainment excise duty was payable on some theatre, cinema or sporting events.
