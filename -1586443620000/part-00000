This browning is the result of a [[Maillard reaction]], altering the flavor of the bread and making it firmer so that it is easier to spread toppings on it. Toasting is a common method of making [[Staling|stale bread]] more [[palatability|palatable]]. Bread is often toasted using a ''[[toaster]]'', but [[toaster oven]]s are also used. Though many types of bread can be toasted the most commonly used is \"sliced bread\", referring to bread that is already sliced and bagged upon purchase and may be white, brown, multigrain, etc.\n\nToast is commonly eaten with [[butter]] or [[margarine]], and sweetened toppings, such as [[jam]] or [[Fruit preserve#Jelly|jelly]]. Regionally, savory spreads, such as [[peanut butter]] or [[yeast]] extracts, may also be popular. When buttered, toast may also be served as an accompaniment to savory dishes, especially soups or stews, or topped with heartier ingredients like eggs or [[baked beans]] as a light meal. Toast is a common [[breakfast food]]. While slices of bread are most common, [[bagel]]s and [[English muffin]]s are also toasted.\n\nScientific studies in the early 2000s found that toast may contain [[Carcinogen#Carcinogens in prepared food|carcinogen]]s ([[acrylamide]]) caused by the [[Food browning|browning process]].<ref name=\"tareke\" />\n\n==Etymology and history==\nThe word \"toast\", which means \"sliced bread singed by heat\", derives from the Latin ''torrere'', \"to burn\".<ref name=\"nytimes.com\"/> The first reference to toast in print is in a recipe for Oyle Soppys (flavoured onions stewed in a gallon of stale beer and a pint of oil) that dates from 1430.<ref name=PhraseFinder>{{cite web|url=http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/the-toast-of-the-town.html|title=The toast of the town|author=Martin, Gary |website=phrases.org.uk|accessdate=21 February 2016}}</ref> In the 1400s and 1500s, toast was discarded or eaten after it was used as a flavoring for drinks.<ref name=PhraseFinder/> In the 1600s, toast was still thought of as something to be put into drinks.<ref name=PhraseFinder/> In his 1602 play ''[[The Merry Wives of Windsor]]'', Shakespeare gives [[Falstaff]] the line: \"Go fetch me a quart of sack; put a toast in't.\"<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.folgerdigitaltexts.org/html/Wiv.html|title=The Merry Wives of Windsor|last=Shakespeare|first=William|publisher=Folger Shakespeare Library|year=|isbn=|editor-last=Mowat|editor-first=Barbara A.|location=|pages=125|chapter=Act 3, Scene 5|editor-last2=Werstine|editor-first2=Paul}}</ref> By the 1700s, there were references to \"toast\" as a gesture that indicates sexual attraction for a person: \"Ay, Madam, it has been your Life's whole Pride of late to be the Common Toast of every Publick Table.\"<ref name=PhraseFinder/> Toast has been used as an element of American [[haute cuisine]] since at least the 1850s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/toast-has-been-a-fad-for-150-years/#fn-1 |title=Toast Has Been A Fad For 150 Years |author=Barry-Jester, Anna Maria |date=March 29, 2016 |work=FiveThirtyEight |accessdate=March 30, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Preparation==\n[[File:Toaster.jpg|thumb|left|A classic two-slot toaster]]\nIn a modern home [[kitchen]], the usual method of toasting bread is by the use of a [[toaster]], an electrical appliance made for that purpose. To use a modern toaster, sliced bread is placed into the narrow slots on the top of the toaster, the toaster is tuned to the correct setting (some may have more elaborate settings than others) and a lever on the front or side is pushed down. The toast is ready when the lever pops up along with the toast. If the bread is insufficiently toasted, the [[lever]] can be pressed down again.\n\nBread toasted in a conventional toaster can \"sweat\" when it is served (i.e. water collects on the surface of the cooled toast). This occurs because moisture in the bread becomes steam while being toasted due to heat and when cooled the steam condenses into water droplets on the surface of the bread.<ref>{{cite web|title=FAQs|url=http://www.toaster.org/faq.html#10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170110015314/http://www.toaster.org/faq.html#10|url-status=dead|archive-date=2017-01-10| website=www.toaster.org| publisher=The Toaster Museum Foundation| accessdate=14 January 2017| date=2017-01-10}}</ref>\n\nIt can also be toasted by a conveyor toaster, which device is often used in hotels, [[restaurants]], and other food service locations. It works by having one [[heating element]] on the top and one on the bottom with a [[metal]] [[conveyor belt]] in the middle which carries the toast between the two heating elements. This allows toast to be made consistently as more slices can be added at any time without waiting for previous ones to pop up.\n\nBread can also be toasted under a [[grilling|grill]] (or broiler), in an open [[oven]], or lying on an oven rack. This \"oven toast\" is usually buttered before toasting. [[Toaster#Types|Toaster oven]]s are special small appliances made for toasting bread or for heating small amounts of other [[food]]s.\n\nBread can also be toasted by holding it near but not directly over an open flame, such as a [[campfire]] or [[fireplace]]; special toasting utensils (e.g. toasting [[fork]]s) are made for this purpose. Before the invention of modern cooking appliances such as toasters and grills, bread has been produced in ovens for millennia, toast can be made in the same oven.\n\nMany brands of [[sliced bread|ready sliced]] bread are available, some of which specifically market their suitability for toasting.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.foodbev.com/news/kingsmill-launches-loaf-of-bread-designed-specifically-for-toasting/|title=Kingsmill launches loaf of bread designed specifically for toasting|last=Desk|first=News|date=2016-11-08|website=FoodBev Media|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-02-19}}</ref>\n\n==Consumption==\n{{anchor|Use}}\n[[File:Vegemite and jelly.jpg|thumb|right|Left: Toast with butter and [[vegemite]].

Toast with [[jam]] or [[marmalade]] is popular. A few other condiments that can be enjoyed with toast are chocolate spread, cream cheese, and peanut butter.

This browning is the result of a [[Maillard reaction]], altering the flavor of the bread and making it firmer so that it is easier to spread toppings on it. Toasting is a common method of making [[Staling|stale bread]] more [[palatability|palatable]]. Bread is often toasted using a ''[[toaster]]'', but [[toaster oven]]s are also used. Though many types of bread can be toasted the most commonly used is \"sliced bread\", referring to bread that is already sliced and bagged upon purchase and may be white, brown, multigrain, etc.\n\nToast is commonly eaten with [[butter]] or [[margarine]], and sweetened toppings, such as [[jam]] or [[Fruit preserve#Jelly|jelly]]. Regionally, savory spreads, such as [[peanut butter]] or [[yeast]] extracts, may also be popular. When buttered, toast may also be served as an accompaniment to savory dishes, especially soups or stews, or topped with heartier ingredients like eggs or [[baked beans]] as a light meal. Toast is a common [[breakfast food]]. While slices of bread are most common, [[bagel]]s and [[English muffin]]s are also toasted.\n\nScientific studies in the early 2000s found that toast may contain [[Carcinogen#Carcinogens in prepared food|carcinogen]]s ([[acrylamide]]) caused by the [[Food browning|browning process]].<ref name=\"tareke\" />\n\n==Etymology and history==\nThe word \"toast\", which means \"sliced bread singed by heat\", derives from the Latin ''torrere'', \"to burn\".<ref name=\"nytimes.com\"/> The first reference to toast in print is in a recipe for Oyle Soppys (flavoured onions stewed in a gallon of stale beer and a pint of oil) that dates from 1430.<ref name=PhraseFinder>{{cite web|url=http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/the-toast-of-the-town.html|title=The toast of the town|author=Martin, Gary |website=phrases.org.uk|accessdate=21 February 2016}}</ref> In the 1400s and 1500s, toast was discarded or eaten after it was used as a flavoring for drinks.<ref name=PhraseFinder/> In the 1600s, toast was still thought of as something to be put into drinks.<ref name=PhraseFinder/> In his 1602 play ''[[The Merry Wives of Windsor]]'', Shakespeare gives [[Falstaff]] the line: \"Go fetch me a quart of sack; put a toast in't.\"<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.folgerdigitaltexts.org/html/Wiv.html|title=The Merry Wives of Windsor|last=Shakespeare|first=William|publisher=Folger Shakespeare Library|year=|isbn=|editor-last=Mowat|editor-first=Barbara A.|location=|pages=125|chapter=Act 3, Scene 5|editor-last2=Werstine|editor-first2=Paul}}</ref> By the 1700s, there were references to \"toast\" as a gesture that indicates sexual attraction for a person: \"Ay, Madam, it has been your Life's whole Pride of late to be the Common Toast of every Publick Table.\"<ref name=PhraseFinder/> Toast has been used as an element of American [[haute cuisine]] since at least the 1850s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/toast-has-been-a-fad-for-150-years/#fn-1 |title=Toast Has Been A Fad For 150 Years |author=Barry-Jester, Anna Maria |date=March 29, 2016 |work=FiveThirtyEight |accessdate=March 30, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Preparation==\n[[File:Toaster.jpg|thumb|left|A classic two-slot toaster]]\nIn a modern home [[kitchen]], the usual method of toasting bread is by the use of a [[toaster]], an electrical appliance made for that purpose. To use a modern toaster, sliced bread is placed into the narrow slots on the top of the toaster, the toaster is tuned to the correct setting (some may have more elaborate settings than others) and a lever on the front or side is pushed down. The toast is ready when the lever pops up along with the toast. If the bread is insufficiently toasted, the [[lever]] can be pressed down again.\n\nBread toasted in a conventional toaster can \"sweat\" when it is served (i.e. water collects on the surface of the cooled toast). This occurs because moisture in the bread becomes steam while being toasted due to heat and when cooled the steam condenses into water droplets on the surface of the bread.<ref>{{cite web|title=FAQs|url=http://www.toaster.org/faq.html#10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170110015314/http://www.toaster.org/faq.html#10|url-status=dead|archive-date=2017-01-10| website=www.toaster.org| publisher=The Toaster Museum Foundation| accessdate=14 January 2017| date=2017-01-10}}</ref>\n\nIt can also be toasted by a conveyor toaster, which device is often used in hotels, [[restaurants]], and other food service locations. It works by having one [[heating element]] on the top and one on the bottom with a [[metal]] [[conveyor belt]] in the middle which carries the toast between the two heating elements. This allows toast to be made consistently as more slices can be added at any time without waiting for previous ones to pop up.\n\nBread can also be toasted under a [[grilling|grill]] (or broiler), in an open [[oven]], or lying on an oven rack. This \"oven toast\" is usually buttered before toasting. [[Toaster#Types|Toaster oven]]s are special small appliances made for toasting bread or for heating small amounts of other [[food]]s.\n\nBread can also be toasted by holding it near but not directly over an open flame, such as a [[campfire]] or [[fireplace]]; special toasting utensils (e.g. toasting [[fork]]s) are made for this purpose. Before the invention of modern cooking appliances such as toasters and grills, bread has been produced in ovens for millennia, toast can be made in the same oven.\n\nMany brands of [[sliced bread|ready sliced]] bread are available, some of which specifically market their suitability for toasting.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.foodbev.com/news/kingsmill-launches-loaf-of-bread-designed-specifically-for-toasting/|title=Kingsmill launches loaf of bread designed specifically for toasting|last=Desk|first=News|date=2016-11-08|website=FoodBev Media|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-02-19}}</ref>\n\n==Consumption==\n{{anchor|Use}}\n[[File:Vegemite and jelly.jpg|thumb|right|Left: Toast with butter and [[vegemite]].

The initial discovery comprises 1,550 specimens, representing 737 different elements, and at least 15 different individuals. Despite this, their classification with other ''Homo'' remains unclear.\n\nThey share several characteristics with the ancestral ''[[Australopithecus]]'' and early ''[[Homo]]'', most notably a small cranial capacity of {{cvt|465\u2013610|cc}}, compared to {{cvt|1270\u20131330|cc}} in modern humans. They are estimated to have averaged {{cvt|143.6|cm|ftin|sigfig=1}} in height and {{cvt|39.7|kg}} in weight, yielding a small [[encephalization quotient]] of 4.5. Nonetheless, ''H. naledi'' brain anatomy seems to have been similar to contemporary ''Homo'', which could indicate equatable cognitive complexity. The persistence of small-brained humans for so long in the midst of bigger-brained contemporaries revises previous conceptions of [[human evolution]], and their mosaic anatomy greatly expands the range of variation for the genus.\n\n''H. naledi'' anatomy indicates that, though they were capable of long distance travel with a humanlike stride and gait, they were more [[arboreal]] than other ''Homo'', better adapted to climbing and [[suspensory behaviour]] in trees than [[endurance running hypothesis|endurance running]]. Tooth anatomy suggests consumption of gritty foods covered in particulates such as dust or dirt. Though they have not been associated with stone tools or any indication of material culture, they appear to have been dextrous enough to produce and handle tools, and likely manufactured [[Early Stone Age|Early]] or [[Middle Stone Age|Middle]] Stone Age [[industry (archaeology)|industries]]. It has also been controversially postulated that these individuals were given funerary rites, and were carried into and placed in the chamber, though predation or natural forces could have been at play.\n\n==Taxonomy==\n===Discovery===\n[[File:Cross-section of the Rising Star Cave system Dinaledi Chamber.svg|left|thumb|upright=1.3|Cross section of [[Rising Star Cave]]]]\nIn October 2013, [[caving|cavers]] Rick Hunter and Steve Tucker, under the direction of South African palaeoanthropologist [[Lee Rogers Berger]], discovered the Dinaledi Chamber in [[Rising Star Cave]] in the [[Cradle of Humankind]], South Africa, containing several hominin fossils.<ref name=\"HawksJA2016\"/> The chamber lies about {{cvt|80|m}} from the entrance, and the main passage is about {{cvt|10|m}} long and {{cvt|25\u201350|cm}} at its narrowest, and is at the bottom of a {{cvt|12|m|adj=on}} vertical drop.<ref name=Dirks2015>{{Cite journal |last=Dirks |first=P.

They said it is also possible that the bodies were dropped down a chute and fell slowly due to irregularity and narrowness of the path down, or a soft mud cushion to land on. In both scenarios, the morticians would have required artificial light to navigate the cave; and the site was used repeatedly for burials as the bodies were not all deposited at the same time.<ref name=Dirks2015/>\n\nIn 2016, palaeoanthropologist Aurore Val countered that such preservation may have been due to [[mummification]] rather than careful burial, and the absence of [[long bone]] heads is reminiscent of predation, and she believes that discounting natural forces such as flooding for depositing the bodies is unjustified. Further, there is evidence of damage done by beetles, beetle larvae, and snails (which facilitate decomposition); but, the chamber does not present ideal conditions for snails, nor does it contain snail shells, which would indicate decomposition actually initiated before deposition in the chamber.<ref name=\"Val\">{{cite journal |title=Deliberate body disposal by hominins in the Dinaledi Chamber, Cradle of Humankind, South Africa? |journal=Journal of Human Evolution |year= 2016 |last=Val |first=A. |doi=10.1016/j.jhevol.2016.02.004 |pmid=27039664 |volume=96 |pages=145\u2013148}}</ref>\n\nNonetheless, in 2017, Dirks, Berger, and colleagues reaffirmed that there is no evidence of water flow into the cave, and that it is more likely that these ''H. naledi'' were buried in the chamber. They also said it is possible that they were buried by contemporary ''Homo'', such as the ancestors of modern humans, rather than other ''H. naledi'', but, nonetheless, that the cultural behaviour of funerary practises is not impossible for ''H. naledi'', and burial in the chamber may have been done to remove decaying bodies from a settlement, prevent scavengers, or due to social bonding and grief.<ref name=\"BergerHawks2017\" />\n\nIn 2018, anthropologist Charles Egeland and colleagues echoed Val's sentiments, and stated that there is insufficient evidence to conclude that human species had developed a concept of the [[afterlife]] so early in time.

The initial discovery comprises 1,550 specimens, representing 737 different elements, and at least 15 different individuals. Despite this, their classification with other ''Homo'' remains unclear.\n\nThey share several characteristics with the ancestral ''[[Australopithecus]]'' and early ''[[Homo]]'', most notably a small cranial capacity of {{cvt|465\u2013610|cc}}, compared to {{cvt|1270\u20131330|cc}} in modern humans. They are estimated to have averaged {{cvt|143.6|cm|ftin|sigfig=1}} in height and {{cvt|39.7|kg}} in weight, yielding a small [[encephalization quotient]] of 4.5. Nonetheless, ''H. naledi'' brain anatomy seems to have been similar to contemporary ''Homo'', which could indicate equatable cognitive complexity. The persistence of small-brained humans for so long in the midst of bigger-brained contemporaries revises previous conceptions of [[human evolution]], and their mosaic anatomy greatly expands the range of variation for the genus.\n\n''H. naledi'' anatomy indicates that, though they were capable of long distance travel with a humanlike stride and gait, they were more [[arboreal]] than other ''Homo'', better adapted to climbing and [[suspensory behaviour]] in trees than [[endurance running hypothesis|endurance running]]. Tooth anatomy suggests consumption of gritty foods covered in particulates such as dust or dirt. Though they have not been associated with stone tools or any indication of material culture, they appear to have been dextrous enough to produce and handle tools, and likely manufactured [[Early Stone Age|Early]] or [[Middle Stone Age|Middle]] Stone Age [[industry (archaeology)|industries]].

It is possible that they commonly ate larger hard items, such as seeds and nuts, but these were processed into smaller pieces before consumption.<ref name=\":0\"/><ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal |last=Towle |first=I. |last2=Irish |first2=J.

Such industries and stone cutting techniques likely evolved independently several times among different ''Homo'' species and populations, or were transported over long distances by the inventors or apprentices and taught.<ref name=\"BergerHawks2017\" />\n\n===Funerals===\n[[File:Cartoon illustrating the geological and taphonomic context and distribution of fossils, sediments and flowstones within the Dinaledi Chamber.jpg|thumb|upright=1.7|Illustration of Dinaledi Chamber, [[Rising Star Cave]]]]\nIn 2015, archaeologist Paul Dirks, Berger, and colleagues concluded that the bodies had to have been deliberately carried and placed into the chamber by people because they appear to have been intact when they were first deposited in the chamber (no evidence of trauma by being dropped into the chamber nor of predation, and exceptional preservation), the chamber is inaccessible to large predators, the chamber appears to be an isolated system and has never been flooded (that is, natural forces were not at play), there is no hidden shaft by which people could have accidentally fallen in through, and there is no evidence of some catastrophe which killed all the individuals inside the chamber. They said it is also possible that the bodies were dropped down a chute and fell slowly due to irregularity and narrowness of the path down, or a soft mud cushion to land on. In both scenarios, the morticians would have required artificial light to navigate the cave; and the site was used repeatedly for burials as the bodies were not all deposited at the same time.<ref name=Dirks2015/>\n\nIn 2016, palaeoanthropologist Aurore Val countered that such preservation may have been due to [[mummification]] rather than careful burial, and the absence of [[long bone]] heads is reminiscent of predation, and she believes that discounting natural forces such as flooding for depositing the bodies is unjustified. Further, there is evidence of damage done by beetles, beetle larvae, and snails (which facilitate decomposition); but, the chamber does not present ideal conditions for snails, nor does it contain snail shells, which would indicate decomposition actually initiated before deposition in the chamber.<ref name=\"Val\">{{cite journal |title=Deliberate body disposal by hominins in the Dinaledi Chamber, Cradle of Humankind, South Africa? |journal=Journal of Human Evolution |year= 2016 |last=Val |first=A. |doi=10.1016/j.jhevol.2016.02.004 |pmid=27039664 |volume=96 |pages=145\u2013148}}</ref>\n\nNonetheless, in 2017, Dirks, Berger, and colleagues reaffirmed that there is no evidence of water flow into the cave, and that it is more likely that these ''H. naledi'' were buried in the chamber. They also said it is possible that they were buried by contemporary ''Homo'', such as the ancestors of modern humans, rather than other ''H. naledi'', but, nonetheless, that the cultural behaviour of funerary practises is not impossible for ''H. naledi'', and burial in the chamber may have been done to remove decaying bodies from a settlement, prevent scavengers, or due to social bonding and grief.<ref name=\"BergerHawks2017\" />\n\nIn 2018, anthropologist Charles Egeland and colleagues echoed Val's sentiments, and stated that there is insufficient evidence to conclude that human species had developed a concept of the [[afterlife]] so early in time. They also said that the preservation of the Dinaledi individuals is similar to those of baboon carcasses which accumulate in caves (either by natural death of cave-dwelling baboons or by a leopard dragging in carcasses).<ref>{{cite journal|first=C.

He played his club rugby league for the [[Grafton Athletic]] and [[Newton Rangers]] teams in the [[Auckland Rugby League]] competition. He later moved to [[Tauranga]] and played for Tauranga and [[Bay of Plenty Steamers|Bay of Plenty]] at rugby union including against the touring [[Springbok national rugby union team|Springbok]] team in 1921.\n\n==Early Life==\nGeorge Iles grew up in [[Christchurch]]. He was the son of Mrs H. Iles and Albert Iles whose parents had come to New Zealand in one of the first \u201cfour ships\u201d which brought settlers to [[Canterbury, New Zealand|Canterbury]]<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Obituary/Mr Albert Iles\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LV, Issue 9359\n| date = 1926-12-09\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19261209.2.9\n| accessdate = 2020-04-09}}</ref>.\nAlbert was a successful sportsman in his own right captaining the Sydenham Football Club in the 1880s and representing [[Canterbury Rugby Football Union|Canterbury]] and [[Rugby Southland|Southland]] for several years. He was also a champion runner. In 1912 the family moved to [[Auckland]] where they lived until 1919 and it was during these years that George made a name for himself as a rugby league player.\n\n==Rugby League Playing Career==\nGeorge Iles began his playing career for [[Grafton Athletic]] with his name first appearing in a team list for their second grade team in 1914 along with his brother Arthur Iles <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Under League Rules/Fixtures and Teams/Grafton Club\n| page = 10\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LI, Issue 15621\n| date = 1914-05-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19140529.2.132.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. The following season he debuted for the Grafton senior team and played in the [[1915 Auckland Rugby League season|Auckland first grade competition]]. He was fortunate to play alongside the likes of New Zealand rugby league legends [[Karl Ifwersen]] and [[Dougie McGregor]], the later having already played for the [[New Zealand national rugby union team|All Blacks]] rugby team<ref>{{cite news\n| title = The League Game Notes and Comments\n| page = 10\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LII, Issue 15915\n| date = 1915-05-12\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19150512.2.124.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. Grafton were to win the Auckland title [[1915 Auckland Rugby League season|this season]].\n\nBoth George and Arthur were to transfer to the [[Newton Rangers]] team for the [[1916 Auckland Rugby League season|1916 season]]. Newton struggled and finished last however Iles did score 7 out of Newton\u2019s 20 tries making him the second highest try scorer for the entire competition. The following year he went even better scoring 12 tries and leading the try scorer lists in the [[1917 Auckland Rugby League season|1917 competition]].\n\nIn 1918 Iles scored 4 tries for Newton and was also elected secretary of the club at their annual meeting<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Newton Rangers Club\n| page = 7\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LV, Issue 16814\n| date = 1918-04-03\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19180403.2.60\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. He gained his first representative jersey when he was selected for the [[Auckland rugby league team|Auckland]] team for, at that time, a very rare representative fixture. During the war years the [[Auckland Rugby League]] had deliberately played almost no representative matches. The match was against [[Canterbury rugby league team|Canterbury]] and played at the [[Auckland Domain]] in front of 10,000 spectators.

Iles was listed to play in the reserves a week later for the Auckland team to play Australia but he did not take the field in an 8-32 loss.\n\n==Rugby Union Playing Career==\nIn 1920 George Iles moved to Tauranga with his family. There because rugby league was barely played he largely played rugby union over the following decade for Tauranga and the [[Bay of Plenty Steamers|Bay of Plenty]] representative team. In July 1920 he played for Tauranga against Grammar Old Boys. It was said \u201cof the Tauranga team the Isles [sic] brothers, three quarters, played well, and if supported by other members of the back division, would have made things a bit more awkward for the visitors.

The match was played at [[Rotorua]] with 5,000 spectators present to witness the Springboks win by 17 points to 9. Iles helped set up the first try to David Werahiko Borell after he initiated a \u201cnice attack\u201d and he did the same for their second and final try when Montgomery \u201csent the ball across to Iles who opened up splendidly, and the ball came across to Borell, who scored near the corner\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Springboks Beat Bay of Plenty\n| page = 3\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume 49, Issue 7781\n| date = 1921-08-25\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19210825.2.13\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.\n\nDespite these fine rugby achievements it appears that Iles had not forgotten his rugby league background. He was part of an effort to establish rugby league in the [[Tauranga]] area in 1922. On April 12 he wrote a letter to the [[Bay of Plenty Times]] about the strength of the rugby league code in various places and was writing in response to a query about why rugby league had been started in the area by Mr. Phelan, a past member of the Tauranga rugby selection committee. Iles responded in a lengthy letter \u201cthe answer is the same as that to why the League game was first commenced \u2013 that is dissatisfaction with Rugby management\u201d, he went on to say \u201ctouching on the standard of play in League, as one who has played both codes I give it as my opinion that League is played on a far higher standard in [[Australia]] and [[Auckland]] than Rugby\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Public Opinion/Rival Codes\n| page = 4\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume L, Issue 7961\n| date = 1922-04-13\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220413.2.27\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. At the end of the season on August 28 he wrote another letter suggesting a match between those players who had been selected for the Tauranga rugby union team and those who had not as there had evidently been some controversy over selections<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Football Challenge\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume L, Issue 8075\n| date = 1922-08-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220829.2.5.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. Then in September he again went on the attack, this time in response to the suggestion by rugby supporters that league players were being paid. He was writing as a member of Tauranga Rugby League and challenged \u201cany member of the Rugby Union to produce evidence of proof of any monetary benefits received by players or officers of the Tauranga Rugby League. If this can be done I will donate \u00a350 to any charity benefit. <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Football Matters\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LI, Issue 8102\n| date = 1922-09-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220929.2.5.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.\n\nHe captained Tauranga in a match against [[Rangitaiki]] which was won 12-5 with Iles involved prominently throughout the match\n<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Rugby Match Won by Tauranga/Good Game Against Rangitaiki Team\n| page =5\n| publisher =Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LIII, Issue 8935\n| date = 1925-07-20\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19250720.2.25\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.\n\nIn 1926 Iles was playing rugby again and represented Tauranga against [[Hamilton, New Zealand|Hamilton]]<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Tauranga v Hamilton\n| page = 15\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LXIII, Issue 19373\n| date = 1926-07-07\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19260707.2.159\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.

He played his club rugby league for the [[Grafton Athletic]] and [[Newton Rangers]] teams in the [[Auckland Rugby League]] competition. He later moved to [[Tauranga]] and played for Tauranga and [[Bay of Plenty Steamers|Bay of Plenty]] at rugby union including against the touring [[Springbok national rugby union team|Springbok]] team in 1921.\n\n==Early Life==\nGeorge Iles grew up in [[Christchurch]]. He was the son of Mrs H. Iles and Albert Iles whose parents had come to New Zealand in one of the first \u201cfour ships\u201d which brought settlers to [[Canterbury, New Zealand|Canterbury]]<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Obituary/Mr Albert Iles\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LV, Issue 9359\n| date = 1926-12-09\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19261209.2.9\n| accessdate = 2020-04-09}}</ref>.\nAlbert was a successful sportsman in his own right captaining the Sydenham Football Club in the 1880s and representing [[Canterbury Rugby Football Union|Canterbury]] and [[Rugby Southland|Southland]] for several years. He was also a champion runner. In 1912 the family moved to [[Auckland]] where they lived until 1919 and it was during these years that George made a name for himself as a rugby league player.\n\n==Rugby League Playing Career==\nGeorge Iles began his playing career for [[Grafton Athletic]] with his name first appearing in a team list for their second grade team in 1914 along with his brother Arthur Iles <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Under League Rules/Fixtures and Teams/Grafton Club\n| page = 10\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LI, Issue 15621\n| date = 1914-05-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19140529.2.132.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.

Grafton were to win the Auckland title [[1915 Auckland Rugby League season|this season]].\n\nBoth George and Arthur were to transfer to the [[Newton Rangers]] team for the [[1916 Auckland Rugby League season|1916 season]]. Newton struggled and finished last however Iles did score 7 out of Newton\u2019s 20 tries making him the second highest try scorer for the entire competition. The following year he went even better scoring 12 tries and leading the try scorer lists in the [[1917 Auckland Rugby League season|1917 competition]].\n\nIn 1918 Iles scored 4 tries for Newton and was also elected secretary of the club at their annual meeting<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Newton Rangers Club\n| page = 7\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LV, Issue 16814\n| date = 1918-04-03\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19180403.2.60\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.

During the war years the [[Auckland Rugby League]] had deliberately played almost no representative matches. The match was against [[Canterbury rugby league team|Canterbury]] and played at the [[Auckland Domain]] in front of 10,000 spectators.

Iles was listed to play in the reserves a week later for the Auckland team to play Australia but he did not take the field in an 8-32 loss.\n\n==Rugby Union Playing Career==\nIn 1920 George Iles moved to Tauranga with his family. There because rugby league was barely played he largely played rugby union over the following decade for Tauranga and the [[Bay of Plenty Steamers|Bay of Plenty]] representative team. In July 1920 he played for Tauranga against Grammar Old Boys. It was said \u201cof the Tauranga team the Isles [sic] brothers, three quarters, played well, and if supported by other members of the back division, would have made things a bit more awkward for the visitors. They both handled the ball well\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Grammar Old Boys v Tauranga\n| page = 8\n| publisher = Observer, Volume XL, Issue 45\n| date = 1920-07-10\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/TO19200710.2.13.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. In September of 1920 Iles made a return to [[Eden Park]], this time in a Bay of Plenty rugby jersey where they were defeated 17-34 to Auckland.

However on the 16th of August he was selected to play for Bay of Plenty against the touring Springbok team<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Local and General\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume 49, Issue 7773\n| date = 1921-08-16\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19210816.2.5\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. The match was played at [[Rotorua]] with 5,000 spectators present to witness the Springboks win by 17 points to 9. Iles helped set up the first try to David Werahiko Borell after he initiated a \u201cnice attack\u201d and he did the same for their second and final try when Montgomery \u201csent the ball across to Iles who opened up splendidly, and the ball came across to Borell, who scored near the corner\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Springboks Beat Bay of Plenty\n| page = 3\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume 49, Issue 7781\n| date = 1921-08-25\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19210825.2.13\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.\n\nDespite these fine rugby achievements it appears that Iles had not forgotten his rugby league background. He was part of an effort to establish rugby league in the [[Tauranga]] area in 1922. On April 12 he wrote a letter to the [[Bay of Plenty Times]] about the strength of the rugby league code in various places and was writing in response to a query about why rugby league had been started in the area by Mr. Phelan, a past member of the Tauranga rugby selection committee. Iles responded in a lengthy letter \u201cthe answer is the same as that to why the League game was first commenced \u2013 that is dissatisfaction with Rugby management\u201d, he went on to say \u201ctouching on the standard of play in League, as one who has played both codes I give it as my opinion that League is played on a far higher standard in [[Australia]] and [[Auckland]] than Rugby\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Public Opinion/Rival Codes\n| page = 4\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume L, Issue 7961\n| date = 1922-04-13\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220413.2.27\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. At the end of the season on August 28 he wrote another letter suggesting a match between those players who had been selected for the Tauranga rugby union team and those who had not as there had evidently been some controversy over selections<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Football Challenge\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume L, Issue 8075\n| date = 1922-08-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220829.2.5.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. Then in September he again went on the attack, this time in response to the suggestion by rugby supporters that league players were being paid. He was writing as a member of Tauranga Rugby League and challenged \u201cany member of the Rugby Union to produce evidence of proof of any monetary benefits received by players or officers of the Tauranga Rugby League. If this can be done I will donate \u00a350 to any charity benefit. <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Football Matters\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LI, Issue 8102\n| date = 1922-09-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220929.2.5.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.\n\nHe captained Tauranga in a match against [[Rangitaiki]] which was won 12-5 with Iles involved prominently throughout the match\n<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Rugby Match Won by Tauranga/Good Game Against Rangitaiki Team\n| page =5\n| publisher =Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LIII, Issue 8935\n| date = 1925-07-20\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19250720.2.25\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.\n\nIn 1926 Iles was playing rugby again and represented Tauranga against [[Hamilton, New Zealand|Hamilton]]<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Tauranga v Hamilton\n| page = 15\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LXIII, Issue 19373\n| date = 1926-07-07\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19260707.2.159\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.

The period of their political ascendancy includes the [[Reign of Terror]], during which time well over ten thousand people were put on trial and executed in France, many for political crimes.\n\nInitially founded in 1789 by [[Anti-monarchism|anti-royalist]] deputies from [[Duchy of Brittany|Brittany]], the club grew into a nationwide [[Republicanism|republican]] movement, with a membership estimated at a half million or more.<ref name=\"Brinton1930\"/> The Jacobin Club was heterogeneous and included both prominent parliamentary factions of the early 1790s, the [[The Mountain|Mountain]] and the [[Girondins]]. In 1792\u20131793 the Girondins were more prominent in [[leadership|leading]] France, the period when France [[French Revolutionary Wars|declared war]] on [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austria]] and on [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]], overthrew the [[List of French monarchs|monarchy]] and set up the [[French First Republic|Republic]]. In May 1793 the leaders of the Mountain faction led by [[Maximilien Robespierre]] succeeded in sidelining the Girondin faction and controlled the government until July 1794. Their time in government featured high levels of political violence, and for this reason the period of the Jacobin/Mountain government is identified as the [[Reign of Terror]]. In October 1793, 21 prominent Girondins were [[guillotine]]d. The Mountain-dominated government executed 17,000 opponents nationwide, purportedly to suppress the [[War in the Vend\u00e9e|Vend\u00e9e insurrection]] and the [[Federalist revolts]] and to prevent any other insurrections.

At the peak there were at least 7,000 chapters throughout France, with a membership estimated at a half-million or more.

Numbers of men were members of two or more of such clubs. Women were not accepted as members of the Jacobin Club (nor of most other clubs), but they were allowed to follow the discussions from the balconies.  The rather high subscription of the Jacobin Club confined its membership to well-off men.

From the start, however, other elements were also present. Besides the teenage son of the [[Louis Philippe II, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans|Duc d'Orl\u00e9ans]], [[Louis-Philippe of France|Louis Philippe]], a future king of France, liberal aristocrats such as the duc d'Aiguillon, the [[Victor Claude, prince de Broglie|prince de Broglie]], and the [[Louis Marie Antoine, vicomte de Noailles|vicomte de Noailles]], and the bourgeoisie formed the mass of the members. The club further included people like \"p\u00e8re\" Michel G\u00e9rard, a peasant proprietor from Tuel-en-Montgermont, in Brittany, whose rough common sense was admired as the oracle of popular wisdom, and whose countryman's waistcoat and plaited hair were later on to become the model for the Jacobin fashion.<ref name=EB1911V15WAP/>\n\nThe Jacobin Club supported the monarchy up until the very [[History of France#Bloodbath in Paris, Republic established (Sept. 1792)|eve of the republic (20 September 1792)]].

But public opinion was now preponderatingly moderate or royalist, and the club was violently attacked in the press and in the streets. The suspicions of the government were aroused; it had to change its meeting-place from the Tuileries to the church of the Jacobins (Temple of Peace) in the Rue du Bac, and in August it was suppressed, after barely a month's existence.

Robespierre was viewed as the quintessential political force of the Jacobin Movement, thrusting ever deeper the dagger of liberty within the despotism of the Monarchy. As a disciple of Rousseau, Robespierre's political views were rooted in Rousseau's notion of the [[social contract]], which promoted \"the rights of man\". {{sfn|Schama|1989|page=475}} Robespierre particularly favored the rights of the broader population to eat, for example, over the rights of individual merchants. \"I denounce the assassins of the people to you and you respond, 'let them act as they will.' In such a system, all is against society; all favors the grain merchants.\"  Robespierre famously elaborated this conception in his speech on 2 December 1792: \"What is the first goal of society? To maintain the imprescribable rights of man. What is the first of these rights? The right to exist.\"<ref>\"Robespierre,\" by Mazauric, C., in \"Dictionnaire historique de la Revolution francaise,\" ed. Albert Soboul.

However, to do so, they brought the Revolution to its bloodiest phase, and the one with least regard for just treatment of individuals. They consolidated republicanism in France and contributed greatly to the [[secularism]] and the sense of nationhood that have marked all French republican regimes to this day.

In May 1793 the leaders of the Mountain faction led by [[Maximilien Robespierre]] succeeded in sidelining the Girondin faction and controlled the government until July 1794.

At the peak there were at least 7,000 chapters throughout France, with a membership estimated at a half-million or more.

Numbers of men were members of two or more of such clubs. Women were not accepted as members of the Jacobin Club (nor of most other clubs), but they were allowed to follow the discussions from the balconies.  The rather high subscription of the Jacobin Club confined its membership to well-off men.

The club further included people like \"p\u00e8re\" Michel G\u00e9rard, a peasant proprietor from Tuel-en-Montgermont, in Brittany, whose rough common sense was admired as the oracle of popular wisdom, and whose countryman's waistcoat and plaited hair were later on to become the model for the Jacobin fashion.<ref name=EB1911V15WAP/>\n\nThe Jacobin Club supported the monarchy up until the very [[History of France#Bloodbath in Paris, Republic established (Sept. 1792)|eve of the republic (20 September 1792)]].

It was patronized by [[Paul Fran\u00e7ois Jean Nicolas, vicomte de Barras|Barras]], and some two hundred and fifty members of [[French Directory|the two councils of the legislature]] were enrolled as members, including many notable ex-Jacobins. It published a newspaper called the ''Journal des Libres'', proclaimed the apotheosis of Robespierre and [[Fran\u00e7ois-No\u00ebl Babeuf|Babeuf]], and attacked the [[French Directory|Directory]] as a ''royaut\u00e9 pentarchique''. But public opinion was now preponderatingly moderate or royalist, and the club was violently attacked in the press and in the streets. The suspicions of the government were aroused; it had to change its meeting-place from the Tuileries to the church of the Jacobins (Temple of Peace) in the Rue du Bac, and in August it was suppressed, after barely a month's existence.

Robespierre was viewed as the quintessential political force of the Jacobin Movement, thrusting ever deeper the dagger of liberty within the despotism of the Monarchy. As a disciple of Rousseau, Robespierre's political views were rooted in Rousseau's notion of the [[social contract]], which promoted \"the rights of man\". {{sfn|Schama|1989|page=475}} Robespierre particularly favored the rights of the broader population to eat, for example, over the rights of individual merchants. \"I denounce the assassins of the people to you and you respond, 'let them act as they will.' In such a system, all is against society; all favors the grain merchants.\"  Robespierre famously elaborated this conception in his speech on 2 December 1792: \"What is the first goal of society? To maintain the imprescribable rights of man. What is the first of these rights? The right to exist.\"<ref>\"Robespierre,\" by Mazauric, C., in \"Dictionnaire historique de la Revolution francaise,\" ed. Albert Soboul.

The constitution reassured the protection of personal freedom and social progress within French society. The cultural influence of the Jacobin movement was effective in reinforcing these rudiments, developing a milieu for revolution.

Once in power the Jacobins completed the overthrow of the [[Ancien R\u00e9gime]] and successfully defended the Revolution from military defeat. However, to do so, they brought the Revolution to its bloodiest phase, and the one with least regard for just treatment of individuals. They consolidated republicanism in France and contributed greatly to the [[secularism]] and the sense of nationhood that have marked all French republican regimes to this day. However, their ruthless and unjudicial methods discredited the Revolution in the eyes of many.
