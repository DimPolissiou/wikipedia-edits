As a child, Freedia took piano and sang in [[choir]],<ref name=\"DeathSexAndMoney\">{{cite podcast|url= http://www.wnyc.org/story/in-new-orleans-big-freedia/|title=in New Orleans: Big Freedia Bounces Back|website=Wnyc.org|host= Anna Sale|date=August 19, 2015|access-date=Aug 21, 2015}}</ref> and has said that music was always a part of her life. Her mother exposed her to artists such as [[Patti LaBelle]], and she was also influenced by the late [[disco]] singer [[Sylvester (singer)|Sylvester]], [[Michael Jackson]], and [[Salt-N-Pepa]].<ref name=\"playjones\"/>\n\nRoss attended [[Cohen College Prep High School|Walter L. Cohen High School]], where she continued to perform in choir and also became the choir director. This experience made her realize she could write and produce.<ref name=\"playjones\"/> According to Freedia, she initially suffered from stage-fright, and had to coax herself onto stage until she became comfortable performing.<ref name=\"playjones\"/>\n\nIn 1998, a young [[drag queen]] by the name of [[Katey Red]] performed [[bounce music]] at a club near the [[Melpomene Projects]] where Ross grew up. Ross, who had grown up four blocks away from Katey Red, began performing as a backup dancer and singer in Red's shows.<ref name=\"dee2010\"/> In 1999, Katey Red released ''Melpomene Block Party'' on the city's leading bounce label, Take Fo Records.<ref name=\"fensterstock\"/> Freedia adopted her stage name after a friend dubbed her \"Freedia\" (pronounced \"Freeda\"). According to Ross, \"I wanted a catchy name that rhymed, and my mother had a club called Diva that I worked for. I called myself the queen of diva\u2014so I coined it: Big Freedia Queen Diva.\"<ref name=\"playjones\"/>\n\n==Music career==\n\n===Early years===\nIn 1999, Freedia released her first [[Single (music)|single]], \"An Ha, Oh Yeah,\" and began performing frequently in clubs and other venues in New Orleans. Other local hits included \"Rock Around the Clock\" and \"Gin 'N My System,\" which was later quoted by [[Lil Wayne]] on a mix tape. She released her first studio album, ''Queen Diva,'' in 2003.<ref name=\"zeichner2011\"/><ref name=\"fensterstock\"/><ref name=\"dodero2010\"/>\n\nFreedia was often described as an artist within the \"sissy bounce\" subgenre,<ref name=\"cadogan2007\"/> though she had stated \"there's no such thing as separating it into straight bounce and sissy bounce. It's all bounce music.\"<ref name=\"flaherty\"/> About her popularity with women at live shows, music journalist Alison Fensterstock wrote, \"When Freedia or Sissy Nobby's singing superaggressive, sexual lyrics about bad boyfriends or whatever, there's something about being able to be the 'I' in the sentence...it's tough to sing along about bitches and hoes when you're a girl. When you identify with Freedia, you're the agent of all this aggressive sexuality instead of its object.\"<ref name=\"dee2010\"/>\n\n[[Hurricane Katrina]] struck New Orleans in 2005, and Freedia, along with other bounce artists such as Katey Red and Freedia's protege Sissy Nobby, were forced to vacate the city. Freedia settled for several months in [[Texas]], where she began performing bounce shows for the locals, helping spread awareness of the genre like other displaced bounce artists. She moved back to New Orleans at the first opportunity. According to Freedia, \"The first club that reopened in New Orleans was Caesar's, and they called me immediately and said let's do a regular night with you here. So we started [[Federal Emergency Management Agency|FEMA]] Fridays. It was the only club open in the city, and a lot of people had a lot of money from Katrina, the checks and stuff, so the joy inside that club\u2014I don't think that'll ever come back.\"<ref name=\"fensterstock\"/>\n\nShe played six to ten shows a week at [[Block party|block parties]], nightclubs, strip clubs, and other venues while the city recuperated.<ref name=\"fensterstock\"/> According to Fensterstock, \"Freedia was one of the first artists to come back after the storm and start working, and [s]he worked really, really hard.

In 2018, she released the EP ''Third Ward Bounce''.\n\nShe also provided additional vocals for [[Drake (musician)|Drake]]'s 2018 number-one hit \"[[Nice for What]]\", though she is not credited as a featured artist. In the late 2010s she befriended [[Kesha]] with the two collaborating on each others\u2019 projects. Freedia is going on tour with Kesha in 2020, and has a new album coming out.\n\n==Early life==\nFreddie Ross was born in New Orleans, [[Louisiana]]. As a child, Freedia took piano and sang in [[choir]],<ref name=\"DeathSexAndMoney\">{{cite podcast|url= http://www.wnyc.org/story/in-new-orleans-big-freedia/|title=in New Orleans: Big Freedia Bounces Back|website=Wnyc.org|host= Anna Sale|date=August 19, 2015|access-date=Aug 21, 2015}}</ref> and has said that music was always a part of her life. Her mother exposed her to artists such as [[Patti LaBelle]], and she was also influenced by the late [[disco]] singer [[Sylvester (singer)|Sylvester]], [[Michael Jackson]], and [[Salt-N-Pepa]].<ref name=\"playjones\"/>\n\nRoss attended [[Cohen College Prep High School|Walter L. Cohen High School]], where she continued to perform in choir and also became the choir director. This experience made her realize she could write and produce.<ref name=\"playjones\"/> According to Freedia, she initially suffered from stage-fright, and had to coax herself onto stage until she became comfortable performing.<ref name=\"playjones\"/>\n\nIn 1998, a young [[drag queen]] by the name of [[Katey Red]] performed [[bounce music]] at a club near the [[Melpomene Projects]] where Ross grew up. Ross, who had grown up four blocks away from Katey Red, began performing as a backup dancer and singer in Red's shows.<ref name=\"dee2010\"/> In 1999, Katey Red released ''Melpomene Block Party'' on the city's leading bounce label, Take Fo Records.<ref name=\"fensterstock\"/> Freedia adopted her stage name after a friend dubbed her \"Freedia\" (pronounced \"Freeda\"). According to Ross, \"I wanted a catchy name that rhymed, and my mother had a club called Diva that I worked for. I called myself the queen of diva\u2014so I coined it: Big Freedia Queen Diva.\"<ref name=\"playjones\"/>\n\n==Music career==\n\n===Early years===\nIn 1999, Freedia released her first [[Single (music)|single]], \"An Ha, Oh Yeah,\" and began performing frequently in clubs and other venues in New Orleans. Other local hits included \"Rock Around the Clock\" and \"Gin 'N My System,\" which was later quoted by [[Lil Wayne]] on a mix tape. She released her first studio album, ''Queen Diva,'' in 2003.<ref name=\"zeichner2011\"/><ref name=\"fensterstock\"/><ref name=\"dodero2010\"/>\n\nFreedia was often described as an artist within the \"sissy bounce\" subgenre,<ref name=\"cadogan2007\"/> though she had stated \"there's no such thing as separating it into straight bounce and sissy bounce. It's all bounce music.\"<ref name=\"flaherty\"/> About her popularity with women at live shows, music journalist Alison Fensterstock wrote, \"When Freedia or Sissy Nobby's singing superaggressive, sexual lyrics about bad boyfriends or whatever, there's something about being able to be the 'I' in the sentence...it's tough to sing along about bitches and hoes when you're a girl. When you identify with Freedia, you're the agent of all this aggressive sexuality instead of its object.\"<ref name=\"dee2010\"/>\n\n[[Hurricane Katrina]] struck New Orleans in 2005, and Freedia, along with other bounce artists such as Katey Red and Freedia's protege Sissy Nobby, were forced to vacate the city. Freedia settled for several months in [[Texas]], where she began performing bounce shows for the locals, helping spread awareness of the genre like other displaced bounce artists. She moved back to New Orleans at the first opportunity. According to Freedia, \"The first club that reopened in New Orleans was Caesar's, and they called me immediately and said let's do a regular night with you here. So we started [[Federal Emergency Management Agency|FEMA]] Fridays. It was the only club open in the city, and a lot of people had a lot of money from Katrina, the checks and stuff, so the joy inside that club\u2014I don't think that'll ever come back.\"<ref name=\"fensterstock\"/>\n\nShe played six to ten shows a week at [[Block party|block parties]], nightclubs, strip clubs, and other venues while the city recuperated.<ref name=\"fensterstock\"/> According to Fensterstock, \"Freedia was one of the first artists to come back after the storm and start working, and [s]he worked really, really hard. If you lived here, it became impossible not to know who [s]he was.\"<ref name=\"dee2010\"/>\n\n===Mainstream exposure===\nFreedia first began to gain national exposure after a 2009 fest-closing gig with Katey Red and Sissy Nobby at the [[The New Orleans Bingo! Show|Bingo Parlour Tent]] and the 2009 [[Voodoo Music + Arts Experience|Voodoo Experience]].<ref name=\"fensterstock\"/> On January 18, 2010, she self-released the album ''Big Freedia Hitz Vol. 1'' on Big Freedia Records.<ref name=\"sullivan2011\"/> The album was a collection of previously performed singles from 1999 to 2010.<ref name=\"fensterstock\"/>\n\nIn March 2010, she was booked for a showcase of New Orleans bounce music at the [[South by Southwest]] music festival in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], but cancelled after an injury. She signed to the Windish Agency afterwards, and booked a summer tour.<ref name=\"fensterstock\"/> Along with Katey Red, Cheeky Blakk, and Sissy Nobby, she was a guest on the May 2010 album ''Ya-ka-may'' by [[funk]] band [[Galactic]].<ref name=\"dee2010\"/> She joined the band for several gigs, and the album peaked at #161 on the [[Billboard (magazine)|US ''Billboard'' Chart]].<ref name=\"ya\"/>\n\nIn May 2010, Freedia began touring with DJ Rusty Lazer and a team of \"bootydancers,\" along with pop band [[Matt and Kim]].<ref name=\"fensterstock\"/> She performed at Hoodstock in [[Bedford\u2013Stuyvesant, Brooklyn|Bed\u2013Stuy]], [[Brooklyn]] in May 2010, and afterwards was written up in the ''[[Village Voice]]''.<ref name=\"dodero2010\"/> She performed for [[contemporary art]] mogul Jeffrey Deitch at [[Art Basel|Basel Miami]] and at New York's [[MoMa]] art museum.<ref name=\"fensterstock\"/> Upon returning to New Orleans, she was pursued by a New York journalist and was featured in ''[[The New York Times]]'' on July 22, 2010.<ref name=\"dee2010\"/> She continued to tour throughout the United States, and in Fall 2010 had her first national television appearance on the ''[[Last Call with Carson Daly]]''.<ref name=\"fensterstock\"/> In October 2010, the ''[[The Times-Picayune/The New Orleans Advocate|New Orleans Times-Picayune]]'' called her an \"overnight sensation\".<ref name=\"fensterstock\"/>\n\nIn 2011, Freedia was named Best Emerging Artist and Best Hip-Hop/Rap Artist in January's \"Best of the Beat Awards.\" ''Big Freedia Hitz Vol. 1'' was nominated by the [[22nd GLAAD Media Awards]] in 2011.<ref name=\"sullivan2011\"/> The album was re-released on [[Scion Audio/Visual|Scion A/V]] in March 2011, along with a number of music videos.<ref name=\"zeichner2011\"/> She also won an MTV 0 Award in 2012 for \"Too Much Ass for TV.\"<ref name=\"Billboard 2\">{{cite news|last1=Benjamin|first1=Jeff|title=MTV O Music Awards: Recapping 23 Awards In 24 Hours As The Flaming Lips Break A World Record|url=https://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/1084857/mtv-o-music-awards-recapping-23-awards-in-24-hours-as-the-flaming-lips|accessdate=18 April 2018|work=Billboard 2|date=June 29, 2012}}</ref>\n\nShe appeared on [[HBO]]'s ''[[Treme (TV series)|Treme]]'', a drama following residents of New Orleans as they try to rebuild after Katrina.<ref name=\"playjones\"/> She performed on ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]'' on January 25, 2012.<ref name=\"playjones\"/> Her performance at [[South by Southwest|SXSW]] in 2012 was reviewed by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' as \"Probably this writer's favorite SXSW set.\"<ref name=\"stone\"/>\n\nFreedia toured with [[The Postal Service]] in 2013, opening for the band at numerous venues throughout July and August.<ref>{{cite web|author=E&E |url=http://www.bigfreedia.com/tour/ |title=Tour |publisher=Big Freedia |date= |accessdate=2013-12-04}}</ref>\n\n{{anchor|Queen of Bounce}}In 2013, music television channel [[Fuse (TV channel)|Fuse]] aired the first season of ''Big Freedia: Queen of Bounce'', a reality show chronicling Freedia's growing mainstream attention and life back in New Orleans.
