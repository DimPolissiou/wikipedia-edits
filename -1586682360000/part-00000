Conversely, the opposition to monarchical rule is sometimes referred to as [[republicanism]].\n\nDepending on the country, a monarchist may advocate for the rule of the person who sits on the throne, a [[pretender]], or someone who would otherwise occupy the throne but has been deposed.\n\n==History==\nMonarchical rule is among the oldest political institutions.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sumerian King List|url=http://gizidda.altervista.org/ebooks/Sumerian-King-List-chronology.pdf|accessdate=7 April 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110222343/http://gizidda.altervista.org/ebooks/Sumerian-King-List-chronology.pdf|archive-date=10 November 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> Monarchy has often claimed legitimacy from a higher power (in early modern Europe the [[divine right of kings]], and in China the [[Mandate of Heaven]]).\n\nIn England, royalty ceded power elsewhere in a gradual process. In 1215, a group of nobles forced [[John, King of England|King John]] to sign the [[Magna Carta]], which guaranteed its barons certain liberties and established that the king's powers were not absolute. In 1687\u201388, the [[Glorious Revolution]] and the overthrow of King [[James II of England|James II]] established the principles of [[constitutional monarchy]], which would later be worked out by [[John Locke|Locke]] and other thinkers. However, [[absolute monarchy]], justified by [[Hobbes]] in ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'' (1651), remained a prominent principle elsewhere. In the 18th century, [[Voltaire]] and others encouraged \"[[enlightened absolutism]]\", which was embraced by the [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor Joseph II]] and by [[Catherine II of Russia]].\n\nIn the late 18th century, the [[American Revolution]] and the [[French Revolution]] were both additional steps in the weakening of power of [[Europe]]an monarchies. Each in its different way exemplified the concept of [[popular sovereignty]] upheld by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]].  1848 then ushered in [[Revolutions of 1848|a wave of revolutions]] against the continental European monarchies.\n\n[[World War I]] and its aftermath saw the end of three major European monarchies: the Russian [[House of Romanov|Romanov]] dynasty, the German [[House of Hohenzollern|Hohenzollern]] dynasty, including all other German monarchies and the Austro-Hungarian [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] dynasty.\n\nThe rise of the [[Hungarian Soviet Republic]] in 1919 provoked an increase in support for monarchism; however, efforts by Hungarian monarchists failed to bring back a royal head of state, and the monarchists settled for a [[regent]], Admiral [[Mikl\u00f3s Horthy]], to represent the monarchy until it could be restored. Horthy was regent from 1920 to 1944. In similar wise the 1938 autocratic state of Franco in Spain claimed to have reconstituted the Spanish monarchy ''in absentia'' (and in this case ultimately yielded to a restoration, in the person of King Juan Carlos).  In 1920s [[Germany]] a number of monarchists gathered around the [[German National People's Party]] which demanded the return of the [[Hohenzollern]] monarchy and an end to the [[Weimar Republic]]; the party retained a large base of support until the rise of [[Nazism]] in the 1930s.\n\nWith the arrival of [[socialism]] in [[Eastern Europe]] by the end of 1947, the remaining Eastern European monarchies, namely the [[Kingdom of Romania]], the [[Kingdom of Hungary]], the [[Albanian Kingdom (1943\u201344)|Kingdom of Albania]], the [[Kingdom of Bulgaria]] and the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]], were all abolished and replaced by [[socialist republics]].\n\nThe aftermath of [[World War II]] also saw the return of monarchist and republican rivalry in [[Italy]], where a referendum was held on whether the state should remain a monarchy or become a republic. The republican side won the vote by a narrow margin, and the modern Republic of Italy was created.\n\nMonarchism as a political force internationally has substantially diminished since the end of the Second World War, though it had an important role in the 1979 [[Iranian Revolution]] and also played a role in the modern political affairs of [[Nepal]]. Nepal was one of the last states to have had an absolute monarch, which continued until King [[Gyanendra of Nepal|Gyanendra]] was peacefully deposed in May 2008 and the country became a federal republic. One of the world's oldest monarchies was abolished in [[Ethiopia]] in 1974 with the fall of Emperor [[Haile Selassie]].\n\n==Current monarchies==\nThe majority of current monarchies are [[constitutional monarchy|constitutional monarchies]]. In most of these, the monarch wields only symbolic power, although in some, the monarch does play a role in political affairs. In [[Thailand]], for instance, King [[Bhumibol Adulyadej]], who reigned from 1946 to 2016, played a critical role in the nation's political agenda and in various military coups. Similarly, in [[Morocco]], King [[Mohammed VI of Morocco|Mohammed VI]] wields significant, but not absolute power.\n\n[[Liechtenstein]] is a democratic [[principality]] whose citizens have voluntarily given more power to their monarch in recent years.\n\nThere remain a handful of countries in which the monarch is the true ruler. The majority of these countries are oil-producing [[Arab]] [[Islamic monarchy|Islamic monarchies]] like [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Bahrain]], [[Qatar]], [[Oman]], and the [[United Arab Emirates]]. Other strong monarchies include [[Brunei]] and [[Eswatini]].\n\n==Justifications for monarchism==\nAbsolute monarchy stands as an opposition to [[History of Anarchism|anarchism]] and, additionally from the [[Age of Enlightenment]], [[liberalism]], and [[communism]].\n\n[[Otto von Habsburg]] advocated a form of constitutional monarchy based on the primacy of the supreme judicial function, with [[hereditary succession]], [[mediation]] by a [[tribunal]] is warranted if suitability is problematic.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20010210220645/http://home1.gte.net/eskandar/ottohabsburg.html</ref><ref>Otto von Habsburg [http://www.worldfreeinternet.us/archive/arc15.htm \"Monarchy or Republic?\"]. (\"Excerpted from The Conservative Tradition in European Thought, Copyright 1970 by Educational Resources Corporation.\")</ref>\n\n===Nonpartisan head of state===\nA monarchy has been justified on the grounds that it provides for a nonpartisan [[head of state]], separate from the [[head of government]], and thus ensures that the highest representative of the country, at home and internationally, does not represent a particular [[political party]], but all people.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Guardian has got it wrong |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/dec/06/monarchy.comment8 |first=Vernon |last=Bogdanor |website=The Guardian |date=6 December 2000}}</ref>\n\n===Safeguard for liberty===\nThe [[International Monarchist League]], founded in 1943, has always sought to promote monarchy on the grounds that it strengthens popular liberty, both in a democracy and in a dictatorship, because by definition the monarch is not beholden to politicians.\n\nBritish-American [[libertarian]] writer [[Matthew Feeney]], on the occasion of the birth of [[Prince George of Cambridge]], the likely future king of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Commonwealth Realms, in 2013, wrote:<ref>{{cite web |title=The Benefits of Monarchy |url=http://reason.com/archives/2013/07/25/the-benefits-of-monarchy |first=Matthew |last=Feeney |website=Reason magazine |date=July 25, 2013}}</ref>\n{{cquote|In the last hundred years many European nations have experienced fascism, communism, and military dictatorships. However, countries with constitutional monarchies have managed for the most part to avoid extreme politics in part because monarchies provide a check on the wills of populist politicians. European monarchies--such as the Danish, Belgian, Swedish, Dutch, Norwegian, and British--have ruled over countries that are among the most stable, prosperous, and free in the world. Constitutional monarchs make it difficult for dramatic political changes to occur, oftentimes by representing traditions and customs that politicians cannot replace and few citizens would like to see overthrown.}}\n\n===Connection to the past===\nSince the middle of the 19th century, some monarchists have stopped defending monarchy on the basis of abstract, universal principles applicable to all nations or even on the grounds that a monarchy would be the best or most practical [[government]] for the nation in question but prefer invoking local symbolic grounds that they would be a particular nation's link to the past. {{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nHence, post-19th century debates on whether to preserve a [[monarchy]] or to adopt a [[Republicanism|republican]] form of government have often been debates over national identity, with the [[monarch]] generally serving as a symbol for other issues.\n\nFor example, in countries like [[Belgium]] and the [[Netherlands]] anti-monarchist talk is often centered on the perceived symbolism of a monarch contrasting with those nation's political culture of [[egalitarianism]]. In [[Belgium]], another factor are the anti-Belgian sentiments of the separatist [[Flemish movement]]. The latter see the monarchy as a predominantly [[francophone]] institution of which the historical roots lie in the French-speaking elite that ruled Belgium until circa 1950s.\n\nIn [[Canada]] and [[Australia]], by contrast, debates over monarchy represent or represented debates whose driving force concerned each nation's relationship with the [[United Kingdom]] and the cultural heritage that this relationship represents.\n\n===Human desire for hierarchy===\nIn a 1943 essay in ''[[The Spectator]]'', \"Equality\", British author [[C.S. Lewis]] criticized egalitarianism, and its corresponding call for the abolition of monarchy, as contrary to human nature, writing, \"Where men are forbidden to honour a king they honour millionaires, athletes, or film-stars instead: even famous prostitutes or gangsters. For spiritual nature, like bodily nature, will be served; deny it food and it will gobble poison.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Equality |url=http://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/27th-august-1943/8/equality |author=C.S.

Conversely, the opposition to monarchical rule is sometimes referred to as [[republicanism]].\n\nDepending on the country, a monarchist may advocate for the rule of the person who sits on the throne, a [[pretender]], or someone who would otherwise occupy the throne but has been deposed.\n\n==History==\nMonarchical rule is among the oldest political institutions.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sumerian King List|url=http://gizidda.altervista.org/ebooks/Sumerian-King-List-chronology.pdf|accessdate=7 April 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110222343/http://gizidda.altervista.org/ebooks/Sumerian-King-List-chronology.pdf|archive-date=10 November 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> Monarchy has often claimed legitimacy from a higher power (in early modern Europe the [[divine right of kings]], and in China the [[Mandate of Heaven]]).\n\nIn England, royalty ceded power elsewhere in a gradual process. In 1215, a group of nobles forced [[John, King of England|King John]] to sign the [[Magna Carta]], which guaranteed its barons certain liberties and established that the king's powers were not absolute. In 1687\u201388, the [[Glorious Revolution]] and the overthrow of King [[James II of England|James II]] established the principles of [[constitutional monarchy]], which would later be worked out by [[John Locke|Locke]] and other thinkers. However, [[absolute monarchy]], justified by [[Hobbes]] in ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'' (1651), remained a prominent principle elsewhere. In the 18th century, [[Voltaire]] and others encouraged \"[[enlightened absolutism]]\", which was embraced by the [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor Joseph II]] and by [[Catherine II of Russia]].\n\nIn the late 18th century, the [[American Revolution]] and the [[French Revolution]] were both additional steps in the weakening of power of [[Europe]]an monarchies. Each in its different way exemplified the concept of [[popular sovereignty]] upheld by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]].  1848 then ushered in [[Revolutions of 1848|a wave of revolutions]] against the continental European monarchies.\n\n[[World War I]] and its aftermath saw the end of three major European monarchies: the Russian [[House of Romanov|Romanov]] dynasty, the German [[House of Hohenzollern|Hohenzollern]] dynasty, including all other German monarchies and the Austro-Hungarian [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] dynasty.\n\nThe rise of the [[Hungarian Soviet Republic]] in 1919 provoked an increase in support for monarchism; however, efforts by Hungarian monarchists failed to bring back a royal head of state, and the monarchists settled for a [[regent]], Admiral [[Mikl\u00f3s Horthy]], to represent the monarchy until it could be restored. Horthy was regent from 1920 to 1944. In similar wise the 1938 autocratic state of Franco in Spain claimed to have reconstituted the Spanish monarchy ''in absentia'' (and in this case ultimately yielded to a restoration, in the person of King Juan Carlos).  In 1920s [[Germany]] a number of monarchists gathered around the [[German National People's Party]] which demanded the return of the [[Hohenzollern]] monarchy and an end to the [[Weimar Republic]]; the party retained a large base of support until the rise of [[Nazism]] in the 1930s.\n\nWith the arrival of [[socialism]] in [[Eastern Europe]] by the end of 1947, the remaining Eastern European monarchies, namely the [[Kingdom of Romania]], the [[Kingdom of Hungary]], the [[Albanian Kingdom (1943\u201344)|Kingdom of Albania]], the [[Kingdom of Bulgaria]] and the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]], were all abolished and replaced by [[socialist republics]].\n\nThe aftermath of [[World War II]] also saw the return of monarchist and republican rivalry in [[Italy]], where a referendum was held on whether the state should remain a monarchy or become a republic. The republican side won the vote by a narrow margin, and the modern Republic of Italy was created.\n\nMonarchism as a political force internationally has substantially diminished since the end of the Second World War, though it had an important role in the 1979 [[Iranian Revolution]] and also played a role in the modern political affairs of [[Nepal]]. Nepal was one of the last states to have had an absolute monarch, which continued until King [[Gyanendra of Nepal|Gyanendra]] was peacefully deposed in May 2008 and the country became a federal republic. One of the world's oldest monarchies was abolished in [[Ethiopia]] in 1974 with the fall of Emperor [[Haile Selassie]].\n\n==Current monarchies==\nThe majority of current monarchies are [[constitutional monarchy|constitutional monarchies]]. In most of these, the monarch wields only symbolic power, although in some, the monarch does play a role in political affairs. In [[Thailand]], for instance, King [[Bhumibol Adulyadej]], who reigned from 1946 to 2016, played a critical role in the nation's political agenda and in various military coups. Similarly, in [[Morocco]], King [[Mohammed VI of Morocco|Mohammed VI]] wields significant, but not absolute power.\n\n[[Liechtenstein]] is a democratic [[principality]] whose citizens have voluntarily given more power to their monarch in recent years.\n\nThere remain a handful of countries in which the monarch is the true ruler. The majority of these countries are oil-producing [[Arab]] [[Islamic monarchy|Islamic monarchies]] like [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Bahrain]], [[Qatar]], [[Oman]], and the [[United Arab Emirates]]. Other strong monarchies include [[Brunei]] and [[Eswatini]].\n\n==Justifications for monarchism==\nAbsolute monarchy stands as an opposition to [[History of Anarchism|anarchism]] and, additionally from the [[Age of Enlightenment]], [[liberalism]], and [[communism]].\n\n[[Otto von Habsburg]] advocated a form of constitutional monarchy based on the primacy of the supreme judicial function, with [[hereditary succession]], [[mediation]] by a [[tribunal]] is warranted if suitability is problematic.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20010210220645/http://home1.gte.net/eskandar/ottohabsburg.html</ref><ref>Otto von Habsburg [http://www.worldfreeinternet.us/archive/arc15.htm \"Monarchy or Republic?\"]. (\"Excerpted from The Conservative Tradition in European Thought, Copyright 1970 by Educational Resources Corporation.\")</ref>\n\n===Nonpartisan head of state===\nA monarchy has been justified on the grounds that it provides for a nonpartisan [[head of state]], separate from the [[head of government]], and thus ensures that the highest representative of the country, at home and internationally, does not represent a particular [[political party]], but all people.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Guardian has got it wrong |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/dec/06/monarchy.comment8 |first=Vernon |last=Bogdanor |website=The Guardian |date=6 December 2000}}</ref>\n\n===Safeguard for liberty===\nThe [[International Monarchist League]], founded in 1943, has always sought to promote monarchy on the grounds that it strengthens popular liberty, both in a democracy and in a dictatorship, because by definition the monarch is not beholden to politicians.\n\nBritish-American [[libertarian]] writer [[Matthew Feeney]], on the occasion of the birth of [[Prince George of Cambridge]], the likely future king of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Commonwealth Realms, in 2013, wrote:<ref>{{cite web |title=The Benefits of Monarchy |url=http://reason.com/archives/2013/07/25/the-benefits-of-monarchy |first=Matthew |last=Feeney |website=Reason magazine |date=July 25, 2013}}</ref>\n{{cquote|In the last hundred years many European nations have experienced fascism, communism, and military dictatorships. However, countries with constitutional monarchies have managed for the most part to avoid extreme politics in part because monarchies provide a check on the wills of populist politicians. European monarchies--such as the Danish, Belgian, Swedish, Dutch, Norwegian, and British--have ruled over countries that are among the most stable, prosperous, and free in the world. Constitutional monarchs make it difficult for dramatic political changes to occur, oftentimes by representing traditions and customs that politicians cannot replace and few citizens would like to see overthrown.}}\n\n===Connection to the past===\nSince the middle of the 19th century, some monarchists have stopped defending monarchy on the basis of abstract, universal principles applicable to all nations or even on the grounds that a monarchy would be the best or most practical [[government]] for the nation in question but prefer invoking local symbolic grounds that they would be a particular nation's link to the past. {{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nHence, post-19th century debates on whether to preserve a [[monarchy]] or to adopt a [[Republicanism|republican]] form of government have often been debates over national identity, with the [[monarch]] generally serving as a symbol for other issues.\n\nFor example, in countries like [[Belgium]] and the [[Netherlands]] anti-monarchist talk is often centered on the perceived symbolism of a monarch contrasting with those nation's political culture of [[egalitarianism]]. In [[Belgium]], another factor are the anti-Belgian sentiments of the separatist [[Flemish movement]]. The latter see the monarchy as a predominantly [[francophone]] institution of which the historical roots lie in the French-speaking elite that ruled Belgium until circa 1950s.\n\nIn [[Canada]] and [[Australia]], by contrast, debates over monarchy represent or represented debates whose driving force concerned each nation's relationship with the [[United Kingdom]] and the cultural heritage that this relationship represents.\n\n===Human desire for hierarchy===\nIn a 1943 essay in ''[[The Spectator]]'', \"Equality\", British author [[C.S. Lewis]] criticized egalitarianism, and its corresponding call for the abolition of monarchy, as contrary to human nature, writing, \"Where men are forbidden to honour a king they honour millionaires, athletes, or film-stars instead: even famous prostitutes or gangsters. For spiritual nature, like bodily nature, will be served; deny it food and it will gobble poison.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Equality |url=http://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/27th-august-1943/8/equality |author=C.S.

Govinda II, a [[Rashtrakuta]] king, conferred the kingdom of North Konkan (modern districts of [[Thane District|Thane]], [[Mumbai Suburban District|Mumbai]] and [[Raigad District|Raigad]]) on Kapardin ([[Sanskrit]]: Wearing the kaparda, a peculiar braid or knot of hair - also a term for god [[Shiva]]/ [[Rishabhanatha]]) I, founder of the Northern Silhara family, around 800.  Since then North Konkan came to be known as Kapardi-dvipa or Kavadidvipa. The capital of this branch was Puri, now known as Rajapur in the Raigad District.\n\nThe dynasty bore the title of ''Tagara-puradhishvara'', which indicates that they originally hailed from Tagara (modern Ter in the [[Osmanabad District]]).\n\nAround 1343 the island of [[Salsette]], and eventually the whole archipelago, passed to the [[Muzaffarids (Gujarat)|Muzaffarid dynasty]].\n\n[[Shilaharas of Southern Maharashtra]] at Kolhapur was the latest of the three and was founded about the time of downfall of the Rashtrakuta Empire.\n\nAll the branches of this family traced their descent from the legendary Vidyadhara prince [[Nagananda|Jimutavahana]], who sacrificed himself to rescue a Naga prince from the clutches of [[Garuda]]. The family-name ''Shilahara'' (meaning \"mountain-peak food\" in Sanskrit) is supposed to have been derived from this incident. Even single inscriptions have more than one form of the name, one has the three forms Silara, Shilara and Shrillara.\n\nLassen suggests that the Shilaharas were of Afghan origin as Silar Kafirs are still found in Afghanistan, but the \"Ayya\" used in the names of almost all their ministers and the non-Sanskrit names of some of the chiefs support the view that they were of [[Kannada]]  origin. The Shilaharas of South [[Konkan]] were the vassals of [[Rashtrakuta]]s and ruled from 765 to 1020.<ref>Dept. Gazetteer: Thane,1982: Dept.

Rattaraja was the last ruler of this dynasty. The document is extremely important as it not only gives the genealogy of the ten ancestors of Rattaraja but also mentions their exploits. The founder, Sanaphulla, was vassal of the [[Rashtrakuta Dynasty|Rastrakuta]] emperor Krisna I who had established his power over [[Konkan]] by 765 and probably handed it to Sanaphulla. The Kharepatan plates declare that Sanaphulla obtained lordship over the territory between Sahya mountain and the sea through the favour of Krisnaraja.\n\nSana-phulla's son Dhammayira is known to have built a fort at Vallipattana on the Western Coast. Aiyaparaja secured victory at Chandrapuri ([[Chandor]]) in Goa. The reign of Avasara I proved to be uneventful. His son Adityavarman, who described as brilliant as the Sun in valour, offered help to the kings of Chandrapuri and Chemulya (modern Chaul), 30 miles to the south of Bombay, so the influence of the Shilaharas had spread over the whole of [[Konkan]]. At this time Laghu Kapardi, the ruler of the [[Thane]] branch, was just a boy and the help given to the ruler of Chaul must have been at his expense. Avasara II continued the policy of his father. Indraraja's son Bhima is styled as 'Rahuvadgrasta Chandramandala' because he overthrew the petty ruler of Chandor. At this time the Kadamba ruler Sasthadeva and his son Chaturbhuja were trying to overthrow the Rastrakuta rule. This explains Bhima's opposition to Chandrapuri or Chandor. Avasara III, no doubt, ruled in troubled times, but had no contribution of his to make. Finally, Rattaraja, loyal to the Rastrakutas, was compelled to transfer his allegiance to Taila II .\n\nSoon after the issue of the plates in 1008, the rule of [[Konkan]] passed over to the later Chalukyas.

They ruled over southern [[Maharashtra]]; the modern districts of Satara, Kolhapur and Belgaon. Their family deity was the goddess Mahalakshmi, whose blessing they claimed to have secured in their copperplate grants (Mahalakshmi-labdha-vara-prasada). Like their relatives of the northern branch of [[Konkan]], the Shilaharas of [[Kolhapur]] claimed to be of the lineage of the Vidyadhara Jimutavahana. They carried the banner of golden Garuda. One of the many titles used by the Shilaharas was ''Tagarapuravaradhisvara'', supreme sovereign ruler of Tagara.<ref>Bhandarkar : 1957, Fleet: 1896</ref>\n\nThe first capital of the Shilaharas was probably at Karad during the reign of Jatiga-II as known from their copper plate grant of Miraj and 'Vikramankadevacharita' of Bilhana.<ref>(Dept. Gazetteer: 2002)</ref> Hence sometimes they are referred as 'Shilaharas of Karad'. Later on although the capital was shifted to [[Kolhapur]], some of their grants mention Valavada, and the hill fort of Pranalaka or Padmanala, ([[Panhala]]) as the places of royal residence. Even though the capital was shifted to [[Kolhapur]], Karhad retained its significance during the Shilahara period. This branch rose to power the latter part of the [[Rashtrakuta]] rule and so, unlike the kings of the other two branches, those of this branch do not mention the genealogy of the [[Rashtrakuta]]s even in their early grants. Later on they acknowledged the suzerainty of the [[Kalyani Chalukya|later Chalukya]] for some time. ''They had used [[Kannada]] as the official language as can be seen from their inscriptions''. This branch continued to hold the Southern [[Maharashtra]] from circa 940 to 1220.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nIt seems that [[Bhoja II (Shilahara dynasty)|Bhoja II]], the last ruler of this family, was overthrown and dispossessed by Singhana in or soon after 1219-20 (Saka 1131) as is borne out by one of Singhana's inscriptions dated Saka 1160.<ref>Fleet: 1896</ref>\n\n===Rulers===\n# Jatiga I (940 - 960)\n# Naivarman (960 - 980)\n# Chandra (980 - 1000)\n# [[Jatiga II]] (1000 - 1020)\n# [[Gonka]] (1020 - 1050)\n# Guhala I \n# Kirtiraja\n# Chandraditya\n# [[Marsimha]] (1050 - 1075)\n# Guhala II (1075 - 1085)\n# [[Bhoja I]] (1085 - 1100)\n# Ballala (1100 - 1108)\n# Gonka II \n# [[Gandaraditya I]] (1108 - 1138)\n# [[Vijayaditya I]] (1138 - 1175)\n# [[Bhoja II (Shilahara dynasty)|Bhoja II]] (1175 - 1212)\n\n==Monuments==\nA number of ancient monuments in [[Mumbai]] and [[Kolhapur]] district pay tribute to this dynasty's prowess:\n* The [[Walkeshwar Temple]] and the [[Banganga Tank]] were built during the reign of Chittaraja, a king of this dynasty.<ref>[http://www.gsbkonkani.net/TEMPLES/BANGANGA%20SHRI%20WALKESHWAR.htm Banganga, Walkeshwar history]</ref>\n* The [[Shiv Mandir, Ambarnath]], also near Mumbai, was also built by Chittaraja in 1060\n* [[Kopineshwar Mandir, Thane|Kopineshwar Mandir]], a Shiva temple in [[Thane]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://thanecity.gov.in/marathi/page.php?id=4 | title=\u092a\u094d\u0930\u093e\u091a\u0940\u0928 \u0936\u094d\u0930\u0940\u0938\u094d\u0925\u093e\u0928\u0915 \u0924\u0947 \u0906\u0927\u0941\u0928\u093f\u0915 \u0920\u093e\u0923\u0947 \u0936\u0939\u0930  |language=Marathi | publisher=[[Thane Municipal Corporation]] | accessdate=8 August 2015}}</ref>\n* [[Parshwanath]] [[Jain]] temple of Kolhapur Shilahars at Ibrahimpur and Bhogoli in [[Chandgad]] taluka.\n* [[Parshwanath]] [[Jain]] temple of Kolhapur Shilahars at Ainapur in [[Gadhinglaj]] taluka.\n* [[Parshwanath]] [[Jain]] temple of Kolhapur Shilahars at Baamni and Sangaon in [[Kagal]] taluka.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n* Bhandarkar R.G.

Govinda II, a [[Rashtrakuta]] king, conferred the kingdom of North Konkan (modern districts of [[Thane District|Thane]], [[Mumbai Suburban District|Mumbai]] and [[Raigad District|Raigad]]) on Kapardin ([[Sanskrit]]: Wearing the kaparda, a peculiar braid or knot of hair - also a term for god [[Shiva]]/ [[Rishabhanatha]]) I, founder of the Northern Silhara family, around 800.  Since then North Konkan came to be known as Kapardi-dvipa or Kavadidvipa. The capital of this branch was Puri, now known as Rajapur in the Raigad District.\n\nThe dynasty bore the title of ''Tagara-puradhishvara'', which indicates that they originally hailed from Tagara (modern Ter in the [[Osmanabad District]]).\n\nAround 1343 the island of [[Salsette]], and eventually the whole archipelago, passed to the [[Muzaffarids (Gujarat)|Muzaffarid dynasty]].\n\n[[Shilaharas of Southern Maharashtra]] at Kolhapur was the latest of the three and was founded about the time of downfall of the Rashtrakuta Empire.\n\nAll the branches of this family traced their descent from the legendary Vidyadhara prince [[Nagananda|Jimutavahana]], who sacrificed himself to rescue a Naga prince from the clutches of [[Garuda]]. The family-name ''Shilahara'' (meaning \"mountain-peak food\" in Sanskrit) is supposed to have been derived from this incident. Even single inscriptions have more than one form of the name, one has the three forms Silara, Shilara and Shrillara.\n\nLassen suggests that the Shilaharas were of Afghan origin as Silar Kafirs are still found in Afghanistan, but the \"Ayya\" used in the names of almost all their ministers and the non-Sanskrit names of some of the chiefs support the view that they were of [[Kannada]]  origin. The Shilaharas of South [[Konkan]] were the vassals of [[Rashtrakuta]]s and ruled from 765 to 1020.<ref>Dept. Gazetteer: Thane,1982: Dept.

Rattaraja was the last ruler of this dynasty. The document is extremely important as it not only gives the genealogy of the ten ancestors of Rattaraja but also mentions their exploits. The founder, Sanaphulla, was vassal of the [[Rashtrakuta Dynasty|Rastrakuta]] emperor Krisna I who had established his power over [[Konkan]] by 765 and probably handed it to Sanaphulla. The Kharepatan plates declare that Sanaphulla obtained lordship over the territory between Sahya mountain and the sea through the favour of Krisnaraja.\n\nSana-phulla's son Dhammayira is known to have built a fort at Vallipattana on the Western Coast. Aiyaparaja secured victory at Chandrapuri ([[Chandor]]) in Goa. The reign of Avasara I proved to be uneventful. His son Adityavarman, who described as brilliant as the Sun in valour, offered help to the kings of Chandrapuri and Chemulya (modern Chaul), 30 miles to the south of Bombay, so the influence of the Shilaharas had spread over the whole of [[Konkan]]. At this time Laghu Kapardi, the ruler of the [[Thane]] branch, was just a boy and the help given to the ruler of Chaul must have been at his expense. Avasara II continued the policy of his father. Indraraja's son Bhima is styled as 'Rahuvadgrasta Chandramandala' because he overthrew the petty ruler of Chandor. At this time the Kadamba ruler Sasthadeva and his son Chaturbhuja were trying to overthrow the Rastrakuta rule. This explains Bhima's opposition to Chandrapuri or Chandor. Avasara III, no doubt, ruled in troubled times, but had no contribution of his to make. Finally, Rattaraja, loyal to the Rastrakutas, was compelled to transfer his allegiance to Taila II .\n\nSoon after the issue of the plates in 1008, the rule of [[Konkan]] passed over to the later Chalukyas.

They ruled over southern [[Maharashtra]]; the modern districts of Satara, Kolhapur and Belgaon. Their family deity was the goddess Mahalakshmi, whose blessing they claimed to have secured in their copperplate grants (Mahalakshmi-labdha-vara-prasada). Like their relatives of the northern branch of [[Konkan]], the Shilaharas of [[Kolhapur]] claimed to be of the lineage of the Vidyadhara Jimutavahana. They carried the banner of golden Garuda. One of the many titles used by the Shilaharas was ''Tagarapuravaradhisvara'', supreme sovereign ruler of Tagara.<ref>Bhandarkar : 1957, Fleet: 1896</ref>\n\nThe first capital of the Shilaharas was probably at Karad during the reign of Jatiga-II as known from their copper plate grant of Miraj and 'Vikramankadevacharita' of Bilhana.<ref>(Dept. Gazetteer: 2002)</ref> Hence sometimes they are referred as 'Shilaharas of Karad'. Later on although the capital was shifted to [[Kolhapur]], some of their grants mention Valavada, and the hill fort of Pranalaka or Padmanala, ([[Panhala]]) as the places of royal residence. Even though the capital was shifted to [[Kolhapur]], Karhad retained its significance during the Shilahara period. This branch rose to power the latter part of the [[Rashtrakuta]] rule and so, unlike the kings of the other two branches, those of this branch do not mention the genealogy of the [[Rashtrakuta]]s even in their early grants. Later on they acknowledged the suzerainty of the [[Kalyani Chalukya|later Chalukya]] for some time. ''They had used [[Kannada]] as the official language as can be seen from their inscriptions''. This branch continued to hold the Southern [[Maharashtra]] from circa 940 to 1220.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nIt seems that [[Bhoja II (Shilahara dynasty)|Bhoja II]], the last ruler of this family, was overthrown and dispossessed by Singhana in or soon after 1219-20 (Saka 1131) as is borne out by one of Singhana's inscriptions dated Saka 1160.<ref>Fleet: 1896</ref>\n\n===Rulers===\n# Jatiga I (940 - 960)\n# Naivarman (960 - 980)\n# Chandra (980 - 1000)\n# [[Jatiga II]] (1000 - 1020)\n# [[Gonka]] (1020 - 1050)\n# Guhala I \n# Kirtiraja\n# Chandraditya\n# [[Marsimha]] (1050 - 1075)\n# Guhala II (1075 - 1085)\n# [[Bhoja I]] (1085 - 1100)\n# Ballala (1100 - 1108)\n# Gonka II \n# [[Gandaraditya I]] (1108 - 1138)\n# [[Vijayaditya I]] (1138 - 1175)\n# [[Bhoja II (Shilahara dynasty)|Bhoja II]] (1175 - 1212)\n\n==Monuments==\nA number of ancient monuments in [[Mumbai]] and [[Kolhapur]] district pay tribute to this dynasty's prowess:\n* The [[Walkeshwar Temple]] and the [[Banganga Tank]] were built during the reign of Chittaraja, a king of this dynasty.<ref>[http://www.gsbkonkani.net/TEMPLES/BANGANGA%20SHRI%20WALKESHWAR.htm Banganga, Walkeshwar history]</ref>\n* The [[Shiv Mandir, Ambarnath]], also near Mumbai, was also built by Chittaraja in 1060\n* [[Kopineshwar Mandir, Thane|Kopineshwar Mandir]], a Shiva temple in [[Thane]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://thanecity.gov.in/marathi/page.php?id=4 | title=\u092a\u094d\u0930\u093e\u091a\u0940\u0928 \u0936\u094d\u0930\u0940\u0938\u094d\u0925\u093e\u0928\u0915 \u0924\u0947 \u0906\u0927\u0941\u0928\u093f\u0915 \u0920\u093e\u0923\u0947 \u0936\u0939\u0930  |language=Marathi | publisher=[[Thane Municipal Corporation]] | accessdate=8 August 2015}}</ref>\n* [[Parshwanath]] [[Jain]] temple of Kolhapur Shilahars at Ibrahimpur and Bhogoli in [[Chandgad]] taluka.\n* [[Parshwanath]] [[Jain]] temple of Kolhapur Shilahars at Ainapur in [[Gadhinglaj]] taluka.\n* [[Parshwanath]] [[Jain]] temple of Kolhapur Shilahars at Baamni and Sangaon in [[Kagal]] taluka.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n* Bhandarkar R.G.

The garrison evolved from an independent company, to a company of Royal Garrison Battalion during the American War of Independence, and a steadily growing and diversifying force of artillery and infantry with various supporting corps from the French Revolution onwards. During the American War of Independence, the garrison in Bermuda fell under the military Commander-in-Chief of North America. Subsequently, it was part of the [[Nova Scotia Command]] until 1868, and was an independent ''Bermuda Command'' from then 'til its closure in 1957.\n\nFrom the 1790s onwards, the garrison existed primarily to defend the [[Royal Naval Dockyard, Bermuda|Royal Naval Dockyard]] (HM Dockyard Bermuda) and other facilities in Bermuda that were important to [[British Empire|Imperial]] security until the HM Dockyard was reduced to a base (a process that was carried out between 1951 and 1957).\n\nAlthough the last professional soldiers (a detachment of the [[Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry]]) were withdrawn in 1957, and the Garrison ceased to exist, two part-time components \u2013 the [[Bermuda Militia Artillery]] and the [[Bermuda Volunteer Rifle Corps]] (retitled ''Bermuda Rifles'') \u2013 continued to exist until 1965, when they amalgamated to create the current [[Royal Bermuda Regiment]].\n\n==1609 to 1701==\n[[File:John Smith 1624 map of Bermuda with Forts 01.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Captain [[John Smith of Jamestown|John Smith's]] 1624 map of [[Bermuda]], showing contemporary fortifications.]]\nThe [[England|English]] colony of Bermuda was settled accidentally in 1609 by the [[Virginia Company]], when its flagship, the [[Sea Venture]] was wrecked off the archipelago. Although most of the settlers eventually completed their journey to [[Jamestown, Virginia]], the company remained in possession of Bermuda, with Virginia's borders officially extended far enough out to sea to include Bermuda in 1612. In the same year, a Governor and more settlers arrived to join the three men left behind from the Sea Venture. From then until 1701, Bermuda's defence was left entirely in the hands of her own [[Bermuda Militias 1612\u20131815|militias]].\n\nBermuda tended toward the Royalist side during the [[English Civil War]], being the first of six colonies to recognise [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] as King on the execution of his father, [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], in 1649, and was one of those targeted by the [[Rump Parliament]] in [[An Act for prohibiting Trade with the Barbadoes, Virginia, Bermuda and Antego]], which was passed on the 30 October 1650. With control of the \"army\" (the militia), the colony's Royalists deposed the Governor, Captain Thomas Turner, elected John Trimingham to replace him, and exiled many of its Parliamentary-leaning [[Independent (religion)|Independents]] to settle the [[Bahamas]] under [[William Sayle]] as the [[Eleutheran Adventurers]]. Bermuda's defences (coastal artillery batteries and forts, as well as its militia) were too powerful for the task force sent in 1651 by Parliament under the command of Admiral Sir [[George Ayscue]] to capture the Royalist colonies. The Parliamentary Navy was consequently forced to blockade Bermuda for several months 'til the Bermudians negotiated a peace.\n\nAlongside Bermuda's militia (as in England, a conscripted infantry force) was a standing body of volunteers (and some convicts, sentenced to carrying out military service) trained as artillery men to garrison the forts and batteries built by the [[Government of Bermuda|local government]]. The earliest of these forts built were the first stone fortifications (and buildings) in the English New World, the first coastal artillery, and are today the oldest English New World fortifications still standing. Together with St. [[St. George's, Bermuda|George's town]], the forts near the town (including the [[Castle Islands Fortifications, Bermuda|Castle Islands Fortifications]]) are today a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\nIn addition to the full-time artillerymen, all of the colony's men of military age were obliged to turn out for militia training and in case of war. They were organised as infantry and (after the Civil War) a Troop of Horse.\n\n==1701 to 1768==\nIn 1701, the threat of war led the English government to post an Independent Company of regular soldiers to Bermuda, where the militia continued to function as a standby in case of war or insurrection. The company, a detachment of the [[2nd Foot]] of the [[English Army]], arrived in Bermuda along with the new Governor, Captain [[Benjamin Bennett (governor)|Benjamin Bennett]], aboard {{HMS|Lincoln|1695|6}}, in May 1701, and was composed of Captain Lancelot Sandys, Lieutenant Robert Henly, two sergeants, two corporals, fifty private soldiers, and a drummer.

Following the conclusion of the [[Seven Years' War]] in 1763, the Independent Company was removed. A company of the [[9th (East Norfolk) Regiment of Foot|9th Foot]] was detached from [[Florida]], reinforced with a detachment from the Bahamas Independent Company, but this force was withdrawn in 1768, leaving only the militia.\n\n==1793 to 1815==\n[[File:Martello Tower seen from Ferry Island Fort, Ferry Reach, Bermuda 2011.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The effect of thirty years of evolution on the design of coastal fortifications, between the 1790s and 1822, can be discerned between ''Ferry Island Fort'' (in the foreground), with multiple guns arrayed to cover the water westward, and the [[Martello tower]] in the background, which used a single gun with 360\u00b0 traverse to cover all of the surrounding area. [[Ferry Reach, Bermuda]], 2011.]]\nRegular soldiers invalided from continental battlefields as part of the [[Royal Garrison Battalion]] had been stationed in Bermuda between 1778 and 1784 during the [[American War of Independence]], but were withdrawn following the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]]. US independence cost the [[Royal Navy]] all of her continental bases between the Canadian [[Maritimes]] and the [[West Indies]]. As a result, the [[Admiralty]] began purchasing land around Bermuda, especially at the under-developed West End, with a view to establishing a dockyard and naval base there. The Royal Naval establishment began with facilities in the town of [[St. George's, Bermuda|St. George's]] in 1795, and by 1812 the island hosted an Admiralty and a dockyard, as well as a naval squadron during the winter. These facilities were to play a major role in the [[American War of 1812]], and Bermuda would develop into the Royal Navy's largest and most important base in the Western Hemisphere.\n\nFollowing the [[French Revolution]], a detachment of the 47th Foot was detached to Bermuda in 1793. Regular soldiers would continue to be stationed in Bermuda from then 'til 1957. With a regular garrison, Bermudians lost interest in maintaining militias. The Militia Acts were allowed to lapse and, other than a brief resurgence during the American War of 1812, the Bermuda Government would not raise local forces until pressed by the [[Secretary of State for War]] to create the [[Bermuda Militia Artillery]] and the [[Bermuda Volunteer Rifle Corps]] eight decades later (although there were a number of short-lived attempts to maintain militia without the contribution of the [[Parliament of Bermuda]]).\n\n==19th century==\n[[File:WD Ordnance Survey Marker Bermuda.JPG|left|thumb|[[War Department (UK)|War Department]] [[Ordnance Survey]] Marker, Bermuda.]]\n[[File:Prospect Camp, Bermuda - Parade in Camp.jpg|right|thumb|200px|A company of infantry on parade at Prospect Camp]]\n[[File:Bermuda - Warwick Camp in the 19th Century.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Warwick Camp in the 19th Century, with tents set up on the 800 yard rifle range.]]\n[[File:Construction of British Army's magazine on Agar's Island, Bermuda in 1870.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Construction of the magazine on [[Agar's Island, Bermuda|Agar's Island]] in 1870]]\n[[File:Parade at Prospect Camp Bermuda 1901.jpg|thumb|200px|Parade at Prospect Camp Bermuda 1901]]\n[[File:Governor of Bermuda at Prospect Camp 1902.jpg|thumb|200px|The Governor, Lt.

This included the construction of numerous fortifications and [[coastal artillery]] batteries (the forts, by and large, were also built to house coastal artillery), manned by the [[Royal Artillery]] (Royal Garrison Artillery, or RGA), and camps where infantry troops were stationed.\n\nFrom the beginning, the [[Royal Engineers]] were an important part of the Garrison, improving pre-existing fortifications and batteries, like [[Fort St. Catherine|Fort St. Catherine's]], building new ones, surveying the island, building a causeway to link St. George's Island to the Main Island, a [[Gibbs Hill Lighthouse|lighthouse at Gibb's Hill]], and various other facilities. A system of military roads was built, also, as the rudimentary roads that had existed before had been used by islanders primarily to take the shortest route to the shore, with most passengers and wares moved around the archipelago by boats.\n\nThe [[Royal Army Ordnance Corps]] operated a depot at [[Ordnance Island, Bermuda|Ordnance Island]], in St. George's, to supply munitions to the coastal artillery. A secret gunpowder store was also built underground at [[Agar's Island, Bermuda|Agar's Island]] in 1870.<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/the-100-man-why-philanthropist-james-martin-gave-away-his-fortune-2182882.html The Telegraph: The $100 man: Why philanthropist James Martin gave away his fortune]</ref><ref>[http://www.privateislandnews.com/futurist-james-martin%E2%80%99s-historic-bermudan-isle/ Private Island News: Futurist James Martin\u2019s Historic Bermudan Isle]</ref> Munitions were also held at the [[Royal Army Service Corps]] wharf on East Broadway, at the outskirts of [[Hamilton, Bermuda|the City of Hamilton]]. The RASC had another wharf in the town of St. George's near to Ordnance Island.\n\nThe St. George's Garrison was a large base including barracks and a hospital to the East and North of St. George's town. Used primarily by the RGA, following the infantry's relocation to Prospect Camp, this large base served the surrounding forts and batteries. As with the fortifications built previously by the colony's militia, the fortifications clustered most thickly at the East End of Bermuda, near St. George's. This was because the primary passage through the surrounding reefline brought vessels close to the Eastern shores of St. David's Island and St. George's Island. There were forts and batteries at other strategic locations throughout Bermuda, however.\n\nOriginally, most of the regular soldiers were deployed around St. George's, but with the development of the [[Hamilton, Bermuda|City of Hamilton]] in the central parishes, which had become the capital in 1815, and of the HM Dockyard at the West End, it became necessary to redeploy the army westwards as well. The heaviest cluster of forts and batteries remained at the East End, where shipping passed in through the reefline from the open Atlantic, and this meant that the artillery soldiers continued to concentrate most heavily at the East End. The infantry, however, established a large camp at the centre of Bermuda circa 1855. Located in [[Devonshire Parish, Bermuda|Devonshire]], on the outskirts of Hamilton, it was called [[Prospect Camp, Bermuda|Prospect Camp]]. The camp housed other units, as well, including [[Royal Garrison Artillery]] detachments at a fort built within the camp, [[Prospect Fort]]. Although Prospect Camp had extensive areas for training, it was surrounded by public roads and residential areas, and had no safe area for a rifle range. Consequently, a second camp, [[Warwick Camp (Bermuda)|Warwick Camp]], was added primarily to provide rifle ranges to the soldiers of the Garrison, and the Dockyard's own [[Royal Marine]] detachment (and those of the ships stationed there).\n\nVarious other smaller sites were used by the Army over the history of the garrison. These included Watford Island and the southern half of Boaz Island, both part of the Admiralty land holdings attached to the HM Dockyard, where Clarence Barracks housed a considerable number of soldiers, and Agar's Island, where substantial underground munitions bunkers were built.\n\nAlthough numerous Irish Catholic and Protestant soldiers and units had served in the British Army before the 19th Century, Catholicism had actually been outlawed in England and Ireland since the [[Reformation]], and Ireland itself was nominally a separate state, the [[Kingdom of Ireland]], ruled by a mostly-Protestant British settler minority. Enfranchisement of Catholics in Britain and its colonies followed the incorporation of the Kingdom of Ireland within the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]], to form the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] in 1801. The [[Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829]] allowed British and Irish Catholics to sit in the Parliament. In Bermuda, the law permitted any church that legally operated in the United Kingdom to do so in the colony, and [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] and [[Methodism|Methodist]] churches operated freely alongside the Church of England. Although the [[Roman Catholic Church]] began to operate openly in Bermuda in the 19th century, its priests were not allowed, at first, to conduct baptisms, weddings or funerals.  However, with large numbers of Catholic soldiers, particularly from Ireland, serving in the Bermuda Garrison, the first Catholic services were conducted by British Army chaplains during the 19th Century. Mount Saint Agnes Academy, a private school operated by the Roman Catholic Church of Bermuda, opened in 1890 at the behest of officers of the [[86th (Royal County Down) Regiment of Foot]] (which was posted to Bermuda from 1880 to 1883), who had requested from the [[Archbishop]] of [[Halifax, Nova Scotia]] a school for the children of Irish Catholic soldiers.<ref>[http://bermuda-online.org/britarmy.htm Bermuda Online: British Army in Bermuda from 1701 to 1977; 1881 to 1883]</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.msa.bm/index.php/about-us/2011-05-06-15-24-05 |title=Mount St. Agnes Academy website: History |access-date=25 July 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130821052104/http://www.msa.bm/index.php/about-us/2011-05-06-15-24-05 |archive-date=21 August 2013 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe 1853 to 1856 [[Crimean War]] highlighted the British Army's shortages of the men, material, and money to fight an expeditionary campaign against a large, modern army. Following the war, and the threat of invasion by France resulting from an assassination attempt on the French Emperor (perceived to originate in Britain), the British Army was under great pressure to provide a permanent force in Britain capable either of defending the country in case of invasion, or of mounting an expeditionary campaign similar to the Crimea. As its funding was not to be increased, it could only do this by redeploying units back to Britain from imperial garrison duty.\n\nBritain's primary motivation in supporting the [[Ottoman Empire]] against Russia (and its serial attempts to prop-up friendly governments in the buffer state of [[Afghanistan]]) was to prevent the border of the Russian Empire advancing to meet that of [[British India]]. Potential Russian interference with Britain's East Asian trade was also a concern. Following the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857|Great Mutiny]] of 1857, it was feared that Indian units might be encouraged to rebel should there be a Russian invasion, and might rebel in any case were British Army units in India reduced. This placed a greater importance on reducing garrisons in quieter parts of the empire, and on replacing them where required with locally raised reserve units.<ref>''The Empire Project: The Rise and Fall of the British World-System, 1830\u20131970'', by John Darwin.

The [[Secretary of State for War]] finally achieved their support by ransoming Bermuda's nascent tourism industry.\n\nBermuda's tourism had arisen without conscious planning, and the hotels at first available to the wealthy visitors who pioneered holidaying on the island were generally small and uninspiring. Bermudian business and political leaders realised that a large, first-rate hotel was required. The development of the hotel hinged on American investment, however. Foreigners were not, at that time, permitted to buy land or businesses in Bermuda, lest their governments use protecting those interests as a pretext for invasion. The USA was seen, throughout the 19th Century, as the primary threat to Bermuda.\n\nAs the Secretary of State for War put it, Bermuda was, at the time, considered by the UK government more as a naval and military base than as a colony. Allowing American investment in the new hotel, as well as plans to widen the channel into [[St. George's Harbour, Bermuda|St. George's Harbour]] (necessary in an age where ships had grown too large to safely use the existing channel, but which it was argued would make an invader's task easier), were seen as weakening Bermuda's defence. The Secretary of State for War insisted that he could not approve either project while Bermuda contributed nothing to her own defence. As a result, two [[Act of Parliament|Acts of the Bermudian Parliament]] were passed in 1892 authorising the creation of the [[Bermuda Volunteer Rifle Corps]] and the [[Bermuda Militia Artillery]], and the project to build the [[The Fairmont Hamilton Princess|Princess Hotel]] was allowed to move forward.\n\nA third act had authorised the creation of a unit of submarine (underwater) miners militia. This would have followed in the pattern of the ''Submarine Mining Militia'' formed in Britain in 1878 and tasked with defending major ports. They received a minimum of fifty-five days training per year, and were recruited from experienced boatmen.  In Bermuda, the unit was intended to operate boat from the Royal Army Service Corps docks in Hamilton and St. George's, tending to the underwater mine defences, but the unit was never raised.\n\nInstead, the Royal Engineers 27th Company (Submarine Mining) which had been permanently reassigned from Halifax, Nova Scotia to Bermuda in 1888 (part of the company had been split off to create the new 40th Company, which remained in Halifax), continued to maintain the mine defences unaided.<ref>[http://www.reubique.com/27557.htm ''27557 Sapper ARCHIBALD LINDSAY, Royal Engineers: 5.

A. for the Bermuda Militia Artillery; V./BER. for the Bermuda Volunteers Rifle Corps; M./BER. S.M. for the Bermuda Submarine Miners. The part-time units were funded by the UK Government.\n\nThe trend from then on was to reduce the regular soldiers, and to shift an increasing part of the burden of the garrison on the part-time units. This process took many decades, however. The number of soldiers began to decline, and then quickly rose again. For the remainder of the 19th Century, military personnel made up a quarter of Bermuda's population, and defence spending, not agriculture or tourism, was the central leg of the Bermudian economy. Many wealthy American visitors actually brought their daughters to holiday on the island specifically in hopes of marrying them to the young, aristocratic military and naval officers who were posted to Bermuda (this put them in competition with local women, as Bermuda had a disproportionate number of spinsters). The new Princess Hotel made the most of this market, sponsoring dances and other social gatherings to which the officers of the garrison were invited to mingle with guests.\n\nIn addition to components of the army garrison, the [[Royal Marines]], part of the [[Royal Navy]], maintained detachments at the Royal Naval Dockyard which included both infantry elements and gunners of the [[Royal Marine Artillery]].\n\n==First World War==\n[[File:Bermuda Volunteer Rifle Corps soldiers with Lincolnshire Regiment 1918.jpg|thumb|left|Bermuda Volunteer Rifle Corps soldiers with the Lincolnshire Regiment in France, 1918]]\n[[File:The First World War Bermuda Contingent of the Royal Garrison Artillery.jpg|thumb|200px|The Bermuda Contingent of the Royal Garrison Artillery]]\n[[File:BC RGA Leaders In England.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Officers and senior enlisted men of the Bermuda Contingent, Royal Garrison Artillery, in Europe.]]\n[[File:95_Coy_RGA_team_and_Governor%27s_Cup_in_Bermuda_1917.jpg|thumb|left|The football team of 95 Company, [[Royal Garrison Artillery]], victors in the 1917 Governor's Cup football match, pose with the cup.]]\n[[File:BVRC-Great-War-Contingent 1914.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The First Contingent of the BVRC to the Lincolns, training in Bermuda for the Western Front, Winter 1914\u201315.]]\n[[File:2-4 Bn East Yorkshire Regiment and General Sir James Willcocks Hamilton Bermuda 1917.jpg|thumb|2/4th Bn.

Lt. Gen. Bullock resumed command on his return to Bermuda, and was succeeded as Governor and Commander-in-Chief by General [[James Willcocks|Sir James Willcocks]] in May, 1917.\n\nThe 2 Lincolns were soon sent to England, preparatory to deployment to France, being replaced by a succession of Canadian battalions. On 19 August 1914, the British Government requested from the Adjutant General of the [[Canadian Militia]] a Canadian battalion to replace the 2 Lincolns, a request that was agreed to on 22 August by Lieutenant-Colonel Alfred Octave Fages, commanding the [[Royal Canadian Regiment]]. As with soldiers of the British [[Territorial Force]] (including the BVRC and BMA), Canadian Militia soldiers were recruited for home defence, and could not be compelled to serve overseas. Consequently, the soldiers of the RCR were asked to volunteer as a unit to the deployment. The unit relieved the 2 Lincolns at Prospect Camp on 13 September 1914. It would use the next eleven months in Bermuda to train in preparation for the Western Front. When it was deployed across the Atlantic on 13 August 1915, it was replaced by The 38th Battalion of the [[Canadian Expeditionary Force]] (CEF). When this battalion, too, deployed to the European theatre of conflict, it was replaced by the 163rd (French-Canadian) Battalion CEF, which arrived there on 29 May 1916. It was replaced by a British Territorial Force unit, the 2/4th Battalion of the [[East Yorkshire Regiment]] on 18 November 1916, and departed for Europe on 27 November 1916.<ref>[http://pi.library.yorku.ca/ojs/index.php/hssh/article/viewFile/16668/15526 ''Canadian Soldiers in Bermuda During World War One,'' by Jean-Pierre Gagnon.

The East Yorkshire Regiment]</ref>\n\nOn the declaration of War in 1914, the BMA was already embodied for annual training and moved onto a war footing. The BVRC embodied, and both units took up their wartime roles. Many Bermudians also enlisted or were commissioned into other British Army units in the United Kingdom and elsewhere, and in [[dominion]] military units, the latter including a significant number of [[Bermudians in the Canadian Expeditionary Force|Bermudians in the CEF]].\n\nThe BMA immediately began the process of forming a contingent of volunteers in 1914 to be despatched to the Western Front, but was prevented from doing so. However, two contingents eventually served as part of the larger Royal Garrison Artillery detachment to the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]. The first, 201 officers and men, under the command of Major [[Thomas Melville Dill]] (who handed overall command of the BMA to a subordinate in order to lead the overseas contingent), left for France on 31 May 1916. A second contingent, of two officers and sixty other ranks, left Bermuda on 6 May 1917, and was merged with the first contingent in France. The contingent, titled the ''Bermuda Contingent, Royal Garrison Artillery'', served primarily in ammunition supply, at dumps, and in delivering ammunition to batteries in the field. The Contingent served at the Somme from June to December 1916. They were then moved away from the Front, serving on docks until April, 1917, when they were attached to the Canadian Corps at Vimy Ridge, serving in the battle for Vimy Ridge. They were at Ypres, from 24 June until 22 October, where three men were killed and several wounded. Two men received the [[Military Medal]]. In Bermuda, the BMA was demobilised on 31 December 1918, and when the overseas contingent returned in July, 1919, it was to no unit. Thirty men who chose to remain on temporarily re-enlisted in the RGA, and the rest were demobilised. The unit was re-embodied on 3 June 1920, when its previous members were called up and joined by fifty new recruits.<ref>[http://www.geocities.ws/ocreachmhaoil/bmaessay1.html History of the Bermuda Militia Artillery, by Jennifer Hind,  author of \"Defence, Not Defiance: A History of the BVRC\"].</ref>\n\nThe BVRC formed a company-sized contingent, Captain Richard Tucker and 88 other ranks, in December 1914, which trained over the winter and spring before being sent to England in June, 1915. As there was a shortage of officers, the [[Governor of Bermuda|Governor and Commander-in-Chief]], Lieutenant-General Sir [[George Bullock (soldier)|George Bullock]], filled the role of [[adjutant]], a position normally filled by a [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|captain]]. As a consequence, the contingent was popularly known as ''Bullock's Boys''. It had been intended for the contingent to join the 2 Lincolns, but that battalion was already in France when they arrived and it became an extra company of 1 Lincolns, instead, deployed to the Western Front in July. It had lost more than half of its strength by September, 1916, and could no longer compose a rifle company. It was merged with the newly arrived BVRC Second Contingent, of one officer and 36 other ranks, who had trained in Bermuda as [[Vickers machine gun]]ners. They were stripped of their Vickers machine guns and retrained as [[Lewis Gun|Lewis light machinegunners]], providing 12 gun teams to 1 Lincolns headquarters. By the War's end, the two contingents had lost over 75% of their combined strength. Forty had died on active service, one received the [[O.B.E]], and six the [[Military Medal]]. Sixteen enlisted men from the two contingents were commissioned, including the Sergeant Major of the First Contingent, Colour-Sergeant R.C. Earl, who would become Commanding Officer of the BVRC after the War. In 1918, 1 Lincolns was withdrawn from France and sent to Ireland to combat the army of the Irish Republic, declared in the 1916 [[Easter Rising]].<ref>[http://www.geocities.ws/gpvillain/8dec1.html THE ROYAL GAZETTE, 8 DECEMBER 1914:] B.V.R.C. 100 MEN ACCEPTED FOR SERVICE.

The coastal artillery forts and batteries were all mothballed or permanently removed from use except for St. David's Battery, which continued in the role of Examination Battery, watching over the channel through which shipping passed through Bermuda's surrounding barrier reef. The regular army infantry battalion was replaced by a company detached from whatever battalion was deployed to Jamaica (the unit on garrison continued to be replaced every three years). This consequently increased the requirement for part-time infantrymen. As the manpower requirements of the artillery had been reduced with the closure of most of the batteries, a new unit, the [[Bermuda Militia Infantry]], was raised, grouped administratively with the BMA and likewise recruiting black soldiers, in 1939. That year, with war imminent, a new coastal artillery battery, with two 6 inch RBL guns, was built on a hill within Warwick Camp, intended to prevent naval vessels from bombarding the Royal Naval Dockyard from off Bermuda's South Shore. As with St. David's Battery, the guns were manned by the BMA and the Defence Electric Lights by the BVE.\n\n==Second World War==\n[[File:Bermuda Volunteer Rifle Corps platoon in March 1944.jpg|thumb|left|Bermuda Volunteer Rifle Corps platoon in March 1944]]\n[[File:Bermuda Militia Artillery Senior Ranks 1944.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Warrant Officer]] and NCOs of the BMA at the [[St. David's Battery, Bermuda|Examination Battery]], St. David's, Bermuda, ca. 1944.]]\n[[File:B Company Bermuda Militia Infantry in 1944.jpg|thumb|left|B Company Bermuda Militia Infantry in 1944]]\n[[File:British Army officer and other rank Bermuda 1942.jpg|thumb|200px|An officer in the temperate Service Dress and soldier in the other ranks tropical Service Dress in [[Bermuda]], in 1942.]]\n[[File:Lieutenant Percy Reginald Tucker Bermuda Home Guard and Bermuda Volunteer Rifle Corps.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Lieutenant Percy Reginald Tucker Bermuda Home Guard]]\n[[File:Bermuda Militia Infantry soldiers in camp.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Bermuda Militia Infantry]] soldiers in camp]]\n[[File:St. David's Battery (or the Examination Battery), St. David's, Bermuda in 2011.jpg|thumb|200px|[[St. David's Battery, Bermuda|St. David's Battery]] (or the Examination Battery), St. David's, Bermuda in 2011]]\n[[File:Guard House at Prospect Camp, Devonshire, Bermuda in 2011.jpg|thumb|200px|The Guard House at Prospect Camp, Devonshire, Bermuda in 2011]]\nDuring the [[Second World War]], as had been the case during the First World War, the units posted to Bermuda to provide the regular infantry company on garrison included reserve units from the [[Canadian Army]] (as the Canadian Militia had been renamed in 1940), embodied for the duration of the war. At the start of the war a company of the 2nd Battalion, [[King's Shropshire Light Infantry]] was on deployment to Bermuda. They were succeeded by the Canadian Army's [[Winnipeg Grenadiers]] in 1940, a company of the 4th Battalion, [[Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders]]  (including future Major Donald Henry \"Bob\" Burns, MC, who would be a Second-in-Command of the Bermuda Regiment, [[Town Crier]] of [[St. George's, Bermuda|St. George's]], and [[Guinness Book of World Records|Guinness world record]] holder for loudest human speaking voice) in 1942, and a company of the Canadian [[Pictou Highlanders]] from 1942 to 1946.\n\nAs during the First World War, the part-time units were again mobilized for the duration, becoming full-time. Conscription was quickly introduced, with all military-age British males resident in Bermuda liable for service. The regular army infantry company operated the headquarters of the Garrison at Prospect Camp, and took responsibility for patrolling and guarding in the central parishes. The BVRC took responsibility for patrolling and defending the East End of Bermuda, and the BMI for the West End. In addition to maintaining guards at the Dockyard and Darrell's Island, the infantry soldiers guarded the trans-Atlantic cable facilities, beaches and inlets, patrolled the island, and operated motor boat patrols.\n\nThe BMA manned the [[St. David's Battery, Bermuda|Examination Battery]] in St. David's, which guarded the primary entrance through the reefs to Bermuda's harbours from the open Atlantic. By 1939, this was the only fixed battery left in use in Bermuda, though others were theoretically able to be returned to use. Similar 6\" guns were fixed at the Dockyard, but it was felt that a [[capital ship]] could potentially bombard the Dockyard from off the South Shore, out of range of both batteries. As a result, a new battery was built on a hilltop within [[Warwick Camp (Bermuda)|Warwick Camp]], with two 6\" guns mounted there. These too were manned by the BMA.\n\nThe Bermuda Volunteer Engineers filled two roles. They continued to operate spot lamps at the coastal artillery batteries, lighting targets for the BMA gun crews at night. In 1937, the BVE had also absorbed the BVRC's signals section, and assumed responsibility for providing signals detachments for all branches of the garrison, as well as to the Royal Naval Dockyard and to the RAF air station at Darrell's Island.\n\nThe BVRC sent a draft to the Lincolns (with volunteers from the other local units attached for the transit) in 1940, following which concern of denuding the garrison meant a moratorium was placed on any further drafts overseas by the local units (although many soldiers were released from their units to train as pilots at the [[Bermuda Flying School]] on [[Darrell's Island, Bermuda|Darrell's Island]]). The school only accepted volunteers from amongst those already serving in one of the local army units. Eighty-eight men were sent to the [[Royal Air Force]] and [[Fleet Air Arm]] before the school closed in 1942, following which it was reorganised as a recruiting arm for the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]], sending 200 aircrew trainees to that unit. The Bermuda Flying School was headed by Major [[Cecil Montgomery-Moore|Montgomery-Moore]], [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|DFC]], who was also the Commanding Officer of the BVE.\n\n[[File:US Army camp at Turtle Hill Bermuda in WWII.jpg|thumb|US Army camp at ''Ackermann's Hill'' (or ''Turtle Hill'') within Warwick Camp, [[Southampton Parish, Bermuda|Southampton]], Bermuda in World War II]]\nIn addition to the British Army and Royal Naval units in Bermuda during the War, a [[Royal Canadian Navy]] base, HMCS Somers Isles, operated at the former Royal Naval site at Convict Bay, and four airbases were operated in Bermuda \u2013 one by the Royal Navy's [[Fleet Air Arm]], the [[Royal Air Force, Bermuda, 1939-1945|Royal Air Force used RAF Darrell's Island]], the US Navy operated flying boats from the [[Naval Air Station Bermuda Annex|US Naval Operating Base]], and the US Army Air Force and the RAF shared an airfield built by the US Army, [[Kindley Field]].\n\nAlthough air and naval units based in Bermuda played an active part in the War, the Axis Powers never dared to launch a direct attack on the colony. With the US entry into the war in 1942, and the considerable buildup of a [[Bermuda Base Command|US Army garrison]] of artillery and infantry forces in Bermuda, as well as the decreased danger posed by German surface ships and submarines, the moratorium preventing local units sending drafts overseas was lifted in 1943.<ref>''Bermuda Forts 1612\u20131957'', Dr. [[Edward C.

The unit took over some of the duties of the BMI and the BVRC, enabling the full-time units to send contingents overseas.\n\nThe BVRC sent a second detachment to the Lincolnshire Regiment, and the Bermuda Militia (Artillery and Infantry together) sent a draft which formed the training cadre and the core of the new [[Caribbean Regiment]].\n\nOther than those needed to defend their bases, US ground forces were withdrawn on the war's end.\n\n==1945 to 1957==\n[[File:BL 6 inch rifle, with two BL 9.2 inch rifles beyond, at St. David's Battery, Bermuda, 2011.jpg|thumb|One of two [[BL 6 inch Mk VII naval gun#Coast defence gun|6 inch RBLs]], with the two [[BL 9.2 inch gun Mk IX\u2013X|9.2 inch RBLs]] visible beyond, at [[St. David's Battery, Bermuda|St. David's Battery]], in 2011]]\nFollowing the war, the BVE and BMI, as well as the Home Guard, ceased to existed. The BMA and BVRC were both demobilised, reduced to skeleton staffs. Both were quickly built back up to strength in 1951, and conscription, which had been used during the war, was re-introduced for both units (the BVRC suitably being retitled simply Bermuda Rifles), although the conscripts served on a part-time basis, whereas wartime service had been full-time for the duration. The last coastal artillery, the [[St. David's Battery, Bermuda|Examination Battery]] on St. David's Head, was removed from use in 1953, and the BMA converted to the infantry role (but remained nominally part of the Royal Regiment of Artillery). The last Imperial Defence Plan was issued the same year. After that, the local units no longer had a role under Imperial defence planning.\n\nThe Regular Army component of the garrison continued to include a full infantry company of 250 soldiers, plus a variety of ''atts and dets'' (attachments or detachments from others corps, such as the [[Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers]]). A company of the [[Gloucestershire Regiment]] (the ''Glosters'') was posted to Prospect Camp in 1947, but this was sent to [[British Honduras]] the following year in response to a [[Guatemala]]n threat of invasion.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://britains-smallwars.com/RRGP/Honduras.htm |title=''Warlike Noises: British Honduras''.

The process of running the naval base down would stretch over the rest of the decade (though part of the base, HMS Malabar, would operate 'til 1995). In November, 1952, it was decided to withdraw the Regular Army garrison, too, which was completed by 1 May 1953. However, during the [[Bermuda Conference (1953)|Bermuda Conference]] of the 4th to 8 December 1953, the Prime Minister, Sir [[Winston Churchill]], met with the [[President of the United States of America|US President]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] and [[Premier of France|French Premier]] [[Joseph Laniel]] in the colony to discuss the security of Western Europe.<ref>[https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1952-54v05p2/ch11 ''FOREIGN RELATIONS OF THE UNITED STATES, 1952\u20131954, WESTERN EUROPEAN SECURITY, VOLUME V, PART 2: F.

The concerns of the [[Government of Bermuda]] and other interested parties were put to the Prime Minister during his stay in Bermuda, and as a result 'A' Company, 1st Battalion, [[Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry]] (1 DCLI) arrived to resume garrison duty at Prospect Camp in 1954.<ref>[https://sites.google.com/site/djkl157/home ''A Company, 1st Battalion, The Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry: Prospect Garrison, Devonshire Bermuda: 1954 - 1957''.]</ref>\n\nThe decision to continue the garrison was reconsidered in 1957. When Churchill had visited in 1953, the British Army had numbered over 400,000 soldiers, but the [[1957 Defence White Paper]] called for the end of [[Conscription in the United Kingdom|National Service]], and the reduction of the Regular Army to 165,000 professional soldiers. Given the much smaller size of the army with the resultant difficulties in meeting its obligations, the high cost per man of the Bermuda Garrison, and the presence of the two part-time units that would remain in Bermuda (and which were capable of absorbing the responsibilities or the regular detachment), it was decided to withdraw the DCLI and all other regular soldiers (other than [[Permanent Staff Instructor]]s and other attachments to the territorial units and the [[Aide-de-camp]] (ADC) to the [[Governor of Bermuda|Governor]]) from Bermuda by the end of May. This was despite strong arguments in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] for the retention of the Garrison by Bermuda-raised [[Denis Keegan]], the [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Nottingham]] South, and [[Frederic Bennett]], MP for [[Torquay]].<ref>[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1957/may/22/united-kingdom-garrison-bermuda ''UNITED KINGDOM GARRISON, BERMUDA (WITHDRAWAL)''.

The Officer Commanding A Company, Major J. Anthony Marsh, DSO, a Second World War veteran of the [[Special Air Service]], took permanent residence in Bermuda after leaving the Regular Army, retiring from military service in 1970 as a Lieutenant-Colonel, commanding the [[Bermuda Regiment]] (a 1965 amalgam of the BVRC and BMA).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.warwickandwarwick.com/pages/library/medals/sasww2.htm |publisher=Warwick & Warwick |title=Outstanding Special Air Service WWII Distinguished Service Order group to Lieutenant Colonel John Anthony Marsh |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502005106/http://www.warwickandwarwick.com/pages/library/medals/sasww2.htm |archivedate=2 May 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe Bermuda Government maintained both territorial units (the BMA being predominantly Black; the BVRC restricted to Whites) until 1965, at which time they were amalgamated into the [[Bermuda Regiment]]. Although trained in conventional light infantry tactics, the Bermuda Regiment has sought new roles to justify the expenditure required to maintain it, including readiness for [[Internal Security]] roles supporting the [[Bermuda Police Service]], providing hurricane relief in Bermuda and other British territories, and taking an increasing hand in maritime patrol. It has also taken on responsibility for providing ceremonial parades that previously had chiefly fallen on the professional soldiers.\n\n==Post 1957==\n[[File:US President JF Kennedy inspects Bermuda Rifles 1961.jpg|thumb|left|US President JF Kennedy and an officer of the Bermuda Militia Artillery inspect Bermuda Rifles in 1961]]\n[[File:Bermuda Regiment Corporal.jpg|thumb|[[Royal Bermuda Regiment]] Corporal aboard a [[Dell Quay Dory]] Mk. 1 boat]]\nAlthough no further regular units have been garrisoned in Bermuda since 1957, detachments have been sent to Bermuda occasionally for internal security, training, recreational, or ceremonial purposes, including elements of the [[airborne forces]], which were on Bermuda for training exercises with the [[Bermuda Regiment]] when Governor Sir [[Richard Sharples]] and his ADC, Captain Hugh Sayers, were murdered on 10 March 1973. A state of emergency was declared, and the Bermuda Regiment and the airborne soldiers (as well as the [[Royal Marines]] detachment from the [[frigate]] {{HMS|Sirius|F40|6}}, serving as [[Standing Royal Navy deployments#Atlantic Patrol Task (North)|West Indies Guard Ship]], and docked at HMS Malabar)<ref>[http://britains-smallwars.com/RRGP/Sirius.htm ''Sirius Business: Or life as part of a ship's Royal Marine Detachment in the West Indies''.

The [[5th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)#5th Airborne Brigade|23 Parachute Field Ambulance]], 1 Parachute Logistic Regiment and the band of the [[1st Battalion, The Parachute Regiment]] subsequently provided protection for Government buildings and officials as well as assisting the Bermuda Police.\n\nThe 1st Battalion [[Royal Regiment of Fusiliers]] was briefly despatched to Bermuda at the request of the local government as a result of riots in 1977 (following the death sentences given to the two men responsible for the murders of the Governor and his ADC, as well as of the 1972 murder of Police Commissioner George Duckett and the 1973 murders of two staff members of a grocery store). At the time, the Bermuda Regiment numbered about 400 officers and men. While sufficient to guard key points around the island, this did not allow for a reserve of men in barracks, and the soldiers assigned to guard duty could not be rotated back to barracks for periods of rest. This shortfall was taken into account by Major-General [[Glyn Gilbert]], the highest-ranking Bermudian in the British Army, when he issued a report on the Bermuda Regiment in which he made a number of recommendations, including its increase to a full battalion of about 750, with three rifle companies and a support company.\n\nThe Bermuda Regiment (now the Royal Bermuda Regiment) trained for the Internal Security role to support the police, but with threat of civil unrest fading over the following decades, it sought new roles, especially the response to hurricanes. Its expertise means it has been increasingly called on to provide similar relief in British Overseas Territories and Commonwealth countries in the West Indies which lack Bermuda's resources. Teams of volunteers have been flown to a series of islands since the 1980s by Royal Air Force transport, helping to fulfill the British Government's obligations to territories throughout that region.<ref>[http://www.royalgazette.com/article/20110615/FEATURES01/706159909 ''Bermuda Regiment to the rescue here...and overseas'', by Kyle Hunter, The Royal Gazette.

The garrison evolved from an independent company, to a company of Royal Garrison Battalion during the American War of Independence, and a steadily growing and diversifying force of artillery and infantry with various supporting corps from the French Revolution onwards. During the American War of Independence, the garrison in Bermuda fell under the military Commander-in-Chief of North America. Subsequently, it was part of the [[Nova Scotia Command]] until 1868, and was an independent ''Bermuda Command'' from then 'til its closure in 1957.\n\nFrom the 1790s onwards, the garrison existed primarily to defend the [[Royal Naval Dockyard, Bermuda|Royal Naval Dockyard]] (HM Dockyard Bermuda) and other facilities in Bermuda that were important to [[British Empire|Imperial]] security until the HM Dockyard was reduced to a base (a process that was carried out between 1951 and 1957).\n\nAlthough the last professional soldiers (a detachment of the [[Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry]]) were withdrawn in 1957, and the Garrison ceased to exist, two part-time components \u2013 the [[Bermuda Militia Artillery]] and the [[Bermuda Volunteer Rifle Corps]] (retitled ''Bermuda Rifles'') \u2013 continued to exist until 1965, when they amalgamated to create the current [[Royal Bermuda Regiment]].\n\n==1609 to 1701==\n[[File:John Smith 1624 map of Bermuda with Forts 01.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Captain [[John Smith of Jamestown|John Smith's]] 1624 map of [[Bermuda]], showing contemporary fortifications.]]\nThe [[England|English]] colony of Bermuda was settled accidentally in 1609 by the [[Virginia Company]], when its flagship, the [[Sea Venture]] was wrecked off the archipelago. Although most of the settlers eventually completed their journey to [[Jamestown, Virginia]], the company remained in possession of Bermuda, with Virginia's borders officially extended far enough out to sea to include Bermuda in 1612. In the same year, a Governor and more settlers arrived to join the three men left behind from the Sea Venture. From then until 1701, Bermuda's defence was left entirely in the hands of her own [[Bermuda Militias 1612\u20131815|militias]].\n\nBermuda tended toward the Royalist side during the [[English Civil War]], being the first of six colonies to recognise [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] as King on the execution of his father, [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], in 1649, and was one of those targetted by the [[Rump Parliament]] in [[An Act for prohibiting Trade with the Barbadoes, Virginia, Bermuda and Antego]], which was passed on the 30 October, 1650. With control of the \"army\" (the militia), the colony's Royalists deposed the Governor, Captain Thomas Turner, elected John Trimingham to replace him, and exiled many of its Parliamentary-leaning [[Independent (religion)|Independents]] to settle the [[Bahamas]] under [[William Sayle]] as the [[Eleutheran Adventurers]]. Bermuda's defences (coastal artillery batteries and forts, as well as its militia) were too powerful for the task force sent in 1651 by Parliament under the command of Admiral Sir [[George Ayscue]] to capture the Royalist colonies. The Parliamentary Navy was consequently forced to blockade Bermuda for several months 'til the Bermudians negotiated a peace.\n\nAlongside Bermuda's militia (as in England, a conscripted infantry force) was a standing body of volunteers (and some convicts, sentenced to carrying out military service) trained as artillery men to garrison the forts and batteries built by the [[Government of Bermuda|local government]]. The earliest of these forts built were the first stone fortifications (and buildings) in the English New World, the first coastal artillery, and are today the oldest English New World fortifications still standing. Together with St. [[St. George's, Bermuda|George's town]], the forts near the town (including the [[Castle Islands Fortifications, Bermuda|Castle Islands Fortifications]]) are today a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\nIn addition to the full-time artillerymen, all of the colony's men of military age were obliged to turn out for militia training and in case of war. They were organised as infantry and (after the Civil War) a Troop of Horse.\n\n==1701 to 1768==\nIn 1701, the threat of war led the English government to post an Independent Company of regular soldiers to Bermuda, where the militia continued to function as a standby in case of war or insurrection. The company, a detachment of the [[2nd Foot]] of the [[English Army]], arrived in Bermuda along with the new Governor, Captain [[Benjamin Bennett (governor)|Benjamin Bennett]], aboard {{HMS|Lincoln|1695|6}}, in May 1701, and was composed of Captain Lancelot Sandys, Lieutenant Robert Henly, two sergeants, two corporals, fifty private soldiers, and a drummer. General [[William Selwyn (Lieutenant Governor of Jamaica)|William Selwyn]] had objected to their detachment.<ref>[http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~bmuwgw/ships3.html Rootsweb: ''Ships of Bermuda - 1700-1749: HMS Lincoln'']</ref> Despite this small regular detachment, the militia remained Bermuda's primary defence force. Following the conclusion of the [[Seven Years' War]] in 1763, the Independent Company was removed. A company of the [[9th (East Norfolk) Regiment of Foot|9th Foot]] was detached from [[Florida]], reinforced with a detachment from the Bahamas Independent Company, but this force was withdrawn in 1768, leaving only the militia.\n\n==1793 to 1815==\n[[File:Martello Tower seen from Ferry Island Fort, Ferry Reach, Bermuda 2011.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The effect of thirty years of evolution on the design of coastal fortifications, between the 1790s and 1822, can be discerned between ''Ferry Island Fort'' (in the foreground), with multiple guns arrayed to cover the water westward, and the [[Martello tower]] in the background, which used a single gun with 360\u00b0 traverse to cover all of the surrounding area. [[Ferry Reach, Bermuda]], 2011.]]\nRegular soldiers invalided from continental battlefields as part of the [[Royal Garrison Battalion]] had been stationed in Bermuda between 1778 and 1784 during the [[American War of Independence]], but were withdrawn following the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]]. US independence cost the [[Royal Navy]] all of her continental bases between the Canadian [[Maritimes]] and the [[West Indies]]. As a result, the [[Admiralty]] began purchasing land around Bermuda, especially at the under-developed West End, with a view to establishing a dockyard and naval base there. The Royal Naval establishment began with facilities in the town of [[St. George's, Bermuda|St. George's]] in 1795, and by 1812 the island hosted an Admiralty and a dockyard, as well as a naval squadron during the winter. These facilities were to play a major role in the [[American War of 1812]], and Bermuda would develop into the Royal Navy's largest and most important base in the Western Hemisphere.\n\nFollowing the [[French Revolution]], a detachment of the 47th Foot was detached to Bermuda in 1793. Regular soldiers would continue to be stationed in Bermuda from then 'til 1957. With a regular garrison, Bermudians lost interest in maintaining militias. The Militia Acts were allowed to lapse and, other than a brief resurgence during the American War of 1812, the Bermuda Government would not raise local forces until pressed by the [[Secretary of State for War]] to create the [[Bermuda Militia Artillery]] and the [[Bermuda Volunteer Rifle Corps]] eight decades later (although there were a number of short-lived attempts to maintain militia without the contribution of the [[Parliament of Bermuda]]).\n\n==19th century==\n[[File:WD Ordnance Survey Marker Bermuda.JPG|left|thumb|[[War Department (UK)|War Department]] [[Ordnance Survey]] Marker, Bermuda.]]\n[[File:Prospect Camp, Bermuda - Parade in Camp.jpg|right|thumb|200px|A company of infantry on parade at Prospect Camp]]\n[[File:Bermuda - Warwick Camp in the 19th Century.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Warwick Camp in the 19th Century, with tents set up on the 800 yard rifle range.]]\n[[File:Construction of British Army's magazine on Agar's Island, Bermuda in 1870.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Construction of the magazine on [[Agar's Island, Bermuda|Agar's Island]] in 1870]]\n[[File:Parade at Prospect Camp Bermuda 1901.jpg|thumb|200px|Parade at Prospect Camp Bermuda 1901]]\n[[File:Governor of Bermuda at Prospect Camp 1902.jpg|thumb|200px|The Governor, Lt.

This included the construction of numerous fortifications and [[coastal artillery]] batteries (the forts, by and large, were also built to house coastal artillery), manned by the [[Royal Artillery]] (Royal Garrison Artillery, or RGA), and camps where infantry troops were stationed.\n\nFrom the beginning, the [[Royal Engineers]] were an important part of the Garrison, improving pre-existing fortifications and batteries, like [[Fort St. Catherine|Fort St. Catherine's]], building new ones, surveying the island, building a causeway to link St. George's Island to the Main Island, a [[Gibbs Hill Lighthouse|lighthouse at Gibb's Hill]], and various other facilities. A system of military roads was built, also, as the rudimentary roads that had existed before had been used by islanders primarily to take the shortest route to the shore, with most passengers and wares moved around the archipelago by boats.\n\nThe [[Royal Army Ordnance Corps]] operated a depot at [[Ordnance Island, Bermuda|Ordnance Island]], in St. George's, to supply munitions to the coastal artillery. A secret gunpowder store was also built underground at [[Agar's Island, Bermuda|Agar's Island]] in 1870.<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/the-100-man-why-philanthropist-james-martin-gave-away-his-fortune-2182882.html The Telegraph: The $100 man: Why philanthropist James Martin gave away his fortune]</ref><ref>[http://www.privateislandnews.com/futurist-james-martin%E2%80%99s-historic-bermudan-isle/ Private Island News: Futurist James Martin\u2019s Historic Bermudan Isle]</ref> Munitions were also held at the [[Royal Army Service Corps]] wharf on East Broadway, at the outskirts of [[Hamilton, Bermuda|the City of Hamilton]]. The RASC had another wharf in the town of St. George's near to Ordnance Island.\n\nThe St. George's Garrison was a large base including barracks and a hospital to the East and North of St. George's town. Used primarily by the RGA, following the infantry's relocation to Prospect Camp, this large base served the surrounding forts and batteries. As with the fortifications built previously by the colony's militia, the fortifications clustered most thickly at the East End of Bermuda, near St. George's. This was because the primary passage through the surrounding reefline brought vessels close to the Eastern shores of St. David's Island and St. George's Island. There were forts and batteries at other strategic locations throughout Bermuda, however.\n\nOriginally, most of the regular soldiers were deployed around St. George's, but with the development of the [[Hamilton, Bermuda|City of Hamilton]] in the central parishes, which had become the capital in 1815, and of the HM Dockyard at the West End, it became necessary to redeploy the army westwards as well. The heaviest cluster of forts and batteries remained at the East End, where shipping passed in through the reefline from the open Atlantic, and this meant that the artillery soldiers continued to concentrate most heavily at the East End. The infantry, however, established a large camp at the centre of Bermuda circa 1855. Located in [[Devonshire Parish, Bermuda|Devonshire]], on the outskirts of Hamilton, it was called [[Prospect Camp, Bermuda|Prospect Camp]]. The camp housed other units, as well, including [[Royal Garrison Artillery]] detachments at a fort built within the camp, [[Prospect Fort]]. Although Prospect Camp had extensive areas for training, it was surrounded by public roads and residential areas, and had no safe area for a rifle range. Consequently, a second camp, [[Warwick Camp (Bermuda)|Warwick Camp]], was added primarily to provide rifle ranges to the soldiers of the Garrison, and the Dockyard's own [[Royal Marine]] detachment (and those of the ships stationed there).\n\nVarious other smaller sites were used by the Army over the history of the garrison. These included Watford Island and the southern half of Boaz Island, both part of the Admiralty land holdings attached to the HM Dockyard, where Clarence Barracks housed a considerable number of soldiers, and Agar's Island, where substantial underground munitions bunkers were built.\n\nAlthough numerous Irish Catholic and Protestant soldiers and units had served in the British Army before the 19th Century, Catholicism had actually been outlawed in England and Ireland since the [[Reformation]], and Ireland itself was nominally a separate state, the [[Kingdom of Ireland]], ruled by a mostly-Protestant British settler minority. Enfranchisement of Catholics in Britain and its colonies followed the incorporation of the Kingdom of Ireland within the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]], to form the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] in 1801. The [[Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829]] allowed British and Irish Catholics to sit in the Parliament. In Bermuda, the law permitted any church that legally operated in the United Kingdom to do so in the colony, and [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] and [[Methodism|Methodist]] churches operated freely alongside the Church of England. Although the [[Roman Catholic Church]] began to operate openly in Bermuda in the 19th century, its priests were not allowed, at first, to conduct baptisms, weddings or funerals.  However, with large numbers of Catholic soldiers, particularly from Ireland, serving in the Bermuda Garrison, the first Catholic services were conducted by British Army chaplains during the 19th Century. Mount Saint Agnes Academy, a private school operated by the Roman Catholic Church of Bermuda, opened in 1890 at the behest of officers of the [[86th (Royal County Down) Regiment of Foot]] (which was posted to Bermuda from 1880 to 1883), who had requested from the [[Archbishop]] of [[Halifax, Nova Scotia]] a school for the children of Irish Catholic soldiers.<ref>[http://bermuda-online.org/britarmy.htm Bermuda Online: British Army in Bermuda from 1701 to 1977; 1881 to 1883]</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.msa.bm/index.php/about-us/2011-05-06-15-24-05 |title=Mount St. Agnes Academy website: History |access-date=25 July 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130821052104/http://www.msa.bm/index.php/about-us/2011-05-06-15-24-05 |archive-date=21 August 2013 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe 1853 to 1856 [[Crimean War]] highlighted the British Army's shortages of the men, material, and money to fight an expeditionary campaign against a large, modern army. Following the war, and the threat of invasion by France resulting from an assassination attempt on the French Emperor (perceived to originate in Britain), the British Army was under great pressure to provide a permanent force in Britain capable either of defending the country in case of invasion, or of mounting an expeditionary campaign similar to the Crimea. As its funding was not to be increased, it could only do this by redeploying units back to Britain from imperial garrison duty.\n\nBritain's primary motivation in supporting the [[Ottoman Empire]] against Russia (and its serial attempts to prop-up friendly governments in the buffer state of [[Afghanistan]]) was to prevent the border of the Russian Empire advancing to meet that of [[British India]]. Potential Russian interference with Britain's East Asian trade was also a concern. Following the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857|Great Mutiny]] of 1857, it was feared that Indian units might be encouraged to rebel should there be a Russian invasion, and might rebel in any case were British Army units in India reduced. This placed a greater importance on reducing garrisons in quieter parts of the empire, and on replacing them where required with locally raised reserve units.<ref>''The Empire Project: The Rise and Fall of the British World-System, 1830\u20131970'', by John Darwin.

The [[Secretary of State for War]] finally achieved their support by ransoming Bermuda's nascent tourism industry.\n\nBermuda's tourism had arisen without conscious planning, and the hotels at first available to the wealthy visitors who pioneered holidaying on the island were generally small and uninspiring. Bermudian business and political leaders realised that a large, first-rate hotel was required. The development of the hotel hinged on American investment, however. Foreigners were not, at that time, permitted to buy land or businesses in Bermuda, lest their governments use protecting those interests as a pretext for invasion. The USA was seen, throughout the 19th Century, as the primary threat to Bermuda.\n\nAs the Secretary of State for War put it, Bermuda was, at the time, considered by the UK government more as a naval and military base than as a colony. Allowing American investment in the new hotel, as well as plans to widen the channel into [[St. George's Harbour, Bermuda|St. George's Harbour]] (necessary in an age where ships had grown too large to safely use the existing channel, but which it was argued would make an invader's task easier), were seen as weakening Bermuda's defence. The Secretary of State for War insisted that he could not approve either project while Bermuda contributed nothing to her own defence. As a result, two [[Act of Parliament|Acts of the Bermudian Parliament]] were passed in 1892 authorising the creation of the [[Bermuda Volunteer Rifle Corps]] and the [[Bermuda Militia Artillery]], and the project to build the [[The Fairmont Hamilton Princess|Princess Hotel]] was allowed to move forward.\n\nA third act had authorised the creation of a unit of submarine (underwater) miners militia. This would have followed in the pattern of the ''Submarine Mining Militia'' formed in Britain in 1878 and tasked with defending major ports. They received a minimum of fifty-five days training per year, and were recruited from experienced boatmen.  In Bermuda, the unit was intended to operate boat from the Royal Army Service Corps docks in Hamilton and St. George's, tending to the underwater mine defences, but the unit was never raised.\n\nInstead, the Royal Engineers 27th Company (Submarine Mining) which had been permanently reassigned from Halifax, Nova Scotia to Bermuda in 1888 (part of the company had been split off to create the new 40th Company, which remained in Halifax), continued to maintain the mine defences unaided.<ref>[http://www.reubique.com/27557.htm ''27557 Sapper ARCHIBALD LINDSAY, Royal Engineers: 5.

A. for the Bermuda Militia Artillery; V./BER. for the Bermuda Volunteers Rifle Corps; M./BER. S.M. for the Bermuda Submarine Miners. The part-time units were funded by the UK Government.\n\nThe trend from then on was to reduce the regular soldiers, and to shift an increasing part of the burden of the garrison on the part-time units. This process took many decades, however. The number of soldiers began to decline, and then quickly rose again. For the remainder of the 19th Century, military personnel made up a quarter of Bermuda's population, and defence spending, not agriculture or tourism, was the central leg of the Bermudian economy. Many wealthy American visitors actually brought their daughters to holiday on the island specifically in hopes of marrying them to the young, aristocratic military and naval officers who were posted to Bermuda (this put them in competition with local women, as Bermuda had a disproportionate number of spinsters). The new Princess Hotel made the most of this market, sponsoring dances and other social gatherings to which the officers of the garrison were invited to mingle with guests.\n\nIn addition to components of the army garrison, the [[Royal Marines]], part of the [[Royal Navy]], maintained detachments at the Royal Naval Dockyard which included both infantry elements and gunners of the [[Royal Marine Artillery]].\n\n==First World War==\n[[File:Bermuda Volunteer Rifle Corps soldiers with Lincolnshire Regiment 1918.jpg|thumb|left|Bermuda Volunteer Rifle Corps soldiers with the Lincolnshire Regiment in France, 1918]]\n[[File:The First World War Bermuda Contingent of the Royal Garrison Artillery.jpg|thumb|200px|The Bermuda Contingent of the Royal Garrison Artillery]]\n[[File:BC RGA Leaders In England.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Officers and senior enlisted men of the Bermuda Contingent, Royal Garrison Artillery, in Europe.]]\n[[File:95_Coy_RGA_team_and_Governor%27s_Cup_in_Bermuda_1917.jpg|thumb|left|The football team of 95 Company, [[Royal Garrison Artillery]], victors in the 1917 Governor's Cup football match, pose with the cup.]]\n[[File:BVRC-Great-War-Contingent 1914.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The First Contingent of the BVRC to the Lincolns, training in Bermuda for the Western Front, Winter 1914\u201315.]]\n[[File:2-4 Bn East Yorkshire Regiment and General Sir James Willcocks Hamilton Bermuda 1917.jpg|thumb|2/4th Bn.

Lt. Gen. Bullock resumed command on his return to Bermuda, and was succeeded as Governor and Commander-in-Chief by General [[James Willcocks|Sir James Willcocks]] in May, 1917.\n\nThe 2 Lincolns were soon sent to England, preparatory to deployment to France, being replaced by a succession of Canadian battalions. On 19 August 1914, the British Government requested from the Adjutant General of the [[Canadian Militia]] a Canadian battalion to replace the 2 Lincolns, a request that was agreed to on 22 August by Lieutenant-Colonel Alfred Octave Fages, commanding the [[Royal Canadian Regiment]]. As with soldiers of the British [[Territorial Force]] (including the BVRC and BMA), Canadian Militia soldiers were recruited for home defence, and could not be compelled to serve overseas. Consequently, the soldiers of the RCR were asked to volunteer as a unit to the deployment. The unit relieved the 2 Lincolns at Prospect Camp on 13 September 1914. It would use the next eleven months in Bermuda to train in preparation for the Western Front. When it was deployed across the Atlantic on 13 August 1915, it was replaced by The 38th Battalion of the [[Canadian Expeditionary Force]] (CEF). When this battalion, too, deployed to the European theatre of conflict, it was replaced by the 163rd (French-Canadian) Battalion CEF, which arrived there on 29 May 1916. It was replaced by a British Territorial Force unit, the 2/4th Battalion of the [[East Yorkshire Regiment]] on 18 November 1916, and departed for Europe on 27 November 1916.<ref>[http://pi.library.yorku.ca/ojs/index.php/hssh/article/viewFile/16668/15526 ''Canadian Soldiers in Bermuda During World War One,'' by Jean-Pierre Gagnon.

The East Yorkshire Regiment]</ref>\n\nOn the declaration of War in 1914, the BMA was already embodied for annual training and moved onto a war footing. The BVRC embodied, and both units took up their wartime roles. Many Bermudians also enlisted or were commissioned into other British Army units in the United Kingdom and elsewhere, and in [[dominion]] military units, the latter including a significant number of [[Bermudians in the Canadian Expeditionary Force|Bermudians in the CEF]].\n\nThe BMA immediately began the process of forming a contingent of volunteers in 1914 to be despatched to the Western Front, but was prevented from doing so. However, two contingents eventually served as part of the larger Royal Garrison Artillery detachment to the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]. The first, 201 officers and men, under the command of Major [[Thomas Melville Dill]] (who handed overall command of the BMA to a subordinate in order to lead the overseas contingent), left for France on 31 May 1916. A second contingent, of two officers and sixty other ranks, left Bermuda on 6 May 1917, and was merged with the first contingent in France. The contingent, titled the ''Bermuda Contingent, Royal Garrison Artillery'', served primarily in ammunition supply, at dumps, and in delivering ammunition to batteries in the field. The Contingent served at the Somme from June to December 1916. They were then moved away from the Front, serving on docks until April, 1917, when they were attached to the Canadian Corps at Vimy Ridge, serving in the battle for Vimy Ridge. They were at Ypres, from 24 June until 22 October, where three men were killed and several wounded. Two men received the [[Military Medal]]. In Bermuda, the BMA was demobilised on 31 December 1918, and when the overseas contingent returned in July, 1919, it was to no unit. Thirty men who chose to remain on temporarily re-enlisted in the RGA, and the rest were demobilised. The unit was re-embodied on 3 June 1920, when its previous members were called up and joined by fifty new recruits.<ref>[http://www.geocities.ws/ocreachmhaoil/bmaessay1.html History of the Bermuda Militia Artillery, by Jennifer Hind,  author of \"Defence, Not Defiance: A History of the BVRC\"].</ref>\n\nThe BVRC formed a company-sized contingent, Captain Richard Tucker and 88 other ranks, in December 1914, which trained over the winter and spring before being sent to England in June, 1915. As there was a shortage of officers, the [[Governor of Bermuda|Governor and Commander-in-Chief]], Lieutenant-General Sir [[George Bullock (soldier)|George Bullock]], filled the role of [[adjutant]], a position normally filled by a [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|captain]]. As a consequence, the contingent was popularly known as ''Bullock's Boys''. It had been intended for the contingent to join the 2 Lincolns, but that battalion was already in France when they arrived and it became an extra company of 1 Lincolns, instead, deployed to the Western Front in July. It had lost more than half of its strength by September, 1916, and could no longer compose a rifle company. It was merged with the newly arrived BVRC Second Contingent, of one officer and 36 other ranks, who had trained in Bermuda as [[Vickers machine gun]]ners. They were stripped of their Vickers machine guns and retrained as [[Lewis Gun|Lewis light machinegunners]], providing 12 gun teams to 1 Lincolns headquarters. By the War's end, the two contingents had lost over 75% of their combined strength. Forty had died on active service, one received the [[O.B.E]], and six the [[Military Medal]]. Sixteen enlisted men from the two contingents were commissioned, including the Sergeant Major of the First Contingent, Colour-Sergeant R.C. Earl, who would become Commanding Officer of the BVRC after the War. In 1918, 1 Lincolns was withdrawn from France and sent to Ireland to combat the army of the Irish Republic, declared in the 1916 [[Easter Rising]].<ref>[http://www.geocities.ws/gpvillain/8dec1.html THE ROYAL GAZETTE, 8 DECEMBER 1914:] B.V.R.C. 100 MEN ACCEPTED FOR SERVICE.

The coastal artillery forts and batteries were all mothballed or permanently removed from use except for St. David's Battery, which continued in the role of Examination Battery, watching over the channel through which shipping passed through Bermuda's surrounding barrier reef. The regular army infantry battalion was replaced by a company detached from whatever battalion was deployed to Jamaica (the unit on garrison continued to be replaced every three years). This consequently increased the requirement for part-time infantrymen. As the manpower requirements of the artillery had been reduced with the closure of most of the batteries, a new unit, the [[Bermuda Militia Infantry]], was raised, grouped administratively with the BMA and likewise recruiting black soldiers, in 1939. That year, with war imminent, a new coastal artillery battery, with two 6 inch RBL guns, was built on a hill within Warwick Camp, intended to prevent naval vessels from bombarding the Royal Naval Dockyard from off Bermuda's South Shore. As with St. David's Battery, the guns were manned by the BMA and the Defence Electric Lights by the BVE.\n\n==Second World War==\n[[File:Bermuda Volunteer Rifle Corps platoon in March 1944.jpg|thumb|left|Bermuda Volunteer Rifle Corps platoon in March 1944]]\n[[File:Bermuda Militia Artillery Senior Ranks 1944.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Warrant Officer]] and NCOs of the BMA at the [[St. David's Battery, Bermuda|Examination Battery]], St. David's, Bermuda, ca. 1944.]]\n[[File:B Company Bermuda Militia Infantry in 1944.jpg|thumb|left|B Company Bermuda Militia Infantry in 1944]]\n[[File:British Army officer and other rank Bermuda 1942.jpg|thumb|200px|An officer in the temperate Service Dress and soldier in the other ranks tropical Service Dress in [[Bermuda]], in 1942.]]\n[[File:Lieutenant Percy Reginald Tucker Bermuda Home Guard and Bermuda Volunteer Rifle Corps.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Lieutenant Percy Reginald Tucker Bermuda Home Guard]]\n[[File:Bermuda Militia Infantry soldiers in camp.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Bermuda Militia Infantry]] soldiers in camp]]\n[[File:St. David's Battery (or the Examination Battery), St. David's, Bermuda in 2011.jpg|thumb|200px|[[St. David's Battery, Bermuda|St. David's Battery]] (or the Examination Battery), St. David's, Bermuda in 2011]]\n[[File:Guard House at Prospect Camp, Devonshire, Bermuda in 2011.jpg|thumb|200px|The Guard House at Prospect Camp, Devonshire, Bermuda in 2011]]\nDuring the [[Second World War]], as had been the case during the First World War, the units posted to Bermuda to provide the regular infantry company on garrison included reserve units from the [[Canadian Army]] (as the Canadian Militia had been renamed in 1940), embodied for the duration of the war. At the start of the war a company of the 2nd Battalion, [[King's Shropshire Light Infantry]] was on deployment to Bermuda. They were succeeded by the Canadian Army's [[Winnipeg Grenadiers]] in 1940, a company of the 4th Battalion, [[Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders]]  (including future Major Donald Henry \"Bob\" Burns, MC, who would be a Second-in-Command of the Bermuda Regiment, [[Town Crier]] of [[St. George's, Bermuda|St. George's]], and [[Guinness Book of World Records|Guinness world record]] holder for loudest human speaking voice) in 1942, and a company of the Canadian [[Pictou Highlanders]] from 1942 to 1946. \n\nAs during the First World War, the part-time units were again mobilized for the duration, becoming full-time. Conscription was quickly introduced, with all military-age British males resident in Bermuda liable for service. The regular army infantry company operated the headquarters of the Garrison at Prospect Camp, and took responsibility for patrolling and guarding in the central parishes. The BVRC took responsibility for patrolling and defending the East End of Bermuda, and the BMI for the West End. In addition to maintaining guards at the Dockyard and Darrell's Island, the infantry soldiers guarded the trans-Atlantic cable facilities, beaches and inlets, patrolled the island, and operated motor boat patrols.\n\nThe BMA manned the [[St. David's Battery, Bermuda|Examination Battery]] in St. David's, which guarded the primary entrance through the reefs to Bermuda's harbours from the open Atlantic. By 1939, this was the only fixed battery left in use in Bermuda, though others were theoretically able to be returned to use. Similar 6\" guns were fixed at the Dockyard, but it was felt that a [[capital ship]] could potentially bombard the Dockyard from off the South Shore, out of range of both batteries. As a result, a new battery was built on a hilltop within [[Warwick Camp (Bermuda)|Warwick Camp]], with two 6\" guns mounted there. These too were manned by the BMA.\n\nThe Bermuda Volunteer Engineers filled two roles. They continued to operate spot lamps at the coastal artillery batteries, lighting targets for the BMA gun crews at night. In 1937, the BVE had also absorbed the BVRC's signals section, and assumed responsibility for providing signals detachments for all branches of the garrison, as well as to the Royal Naval Dockyard and to the RAF air station at Darrell's Island.\n\nThe BVRC sent a draft to the Lincolns (with volunteers from the other local units attached for the transit) in 1940, following which concern of denuding the garrison meant a moratorium was placed on any further drafts overseas by the local units (although many soldiers were released from their units to train as pilots at the [[Bermuda Flying School]] on [[Darrell's Island, Bermuda|Darrell's Island]]). The school only accepted volunteers from amongst those already serving in one of the local army units. Eighty-eight men were sent to the [[Royal Air Force]] and [[Fleet Air Arm]] before the school closed in 1942, following which it was reorganised as a recruiting arm for the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]], sending 200 aircrew trainees to that unit. The Bermuda Flying School was headed by Major [[Cecil Montgomery-Moore|Montgomery-Moore]], [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|DFC]], who was also the Commanding Officer of the BVE.\n\n[[File:US Army camp at Turtle Hill Bermuda in WWII.jpg|thumb|US Army camp at ''Ackermann's Hill'' (or ''Turtle Hill'') within Warwick Camp, [[Southampton Parish, Bermuda|Southampton]], Bermuda in World War II]]\nIn addition to the British Army and Royal Naval units in Bermuda during the War, a [[Royal Canadian Navy]] base, HMCS Somers Isles, operated at the former Royal Naval site at Convict Bay, and four airbases were operated in Bermuda \u2013 one by the Royal Navy's [[Fleet Air Arm]], the [[Royal Air Force, Bermuda, 1939-1945|Royal Air Force used RAF Darrell's Island]], the US Navy operated flying boats from the [[Naval Air Station Bermuda Annex|US Naval Operating Base]], and the US Army Air Force and the RAF shared an airfield built by the US Army, [[Kindley Field]].\n\nAlthough air and naval units based in Bermuda played an active part in the War, the Axis Powers never dared to launch a direct attack on the colony. With the US entry into the war in 1942, and the considerable buildup of a [[Bermuda Base Command|US Army garrison]] of artillery and infantry forces in Bermuda, as well as the decreased danger posed by German surface ships and submarines, the moratorium preventing local units sending drafts overseas was lifted in 1943.<ref>''Bermuda Forts 1612\u20131957'', Dr. [[Edward C.

The unit took over some of the duties of the BMI and the BVRC, enabling the full-time units to send contingents overseas.\n\nThe BVRC sent a second detachment to the Lincolnshire Regiment, and the Bermuda Militia (Artillery and Infantry together) sent a draft which formed the training cadre and the core of the new [[Caribbean Regiment]].\n\nOther than those needed to defend their bases, US ground forces were withdrawn on the war's end.\n\n==1945 to 1957==\n[[File:BL 6 inch rifle, with two BL 9.2 inch rifles beyond, at St. David's Battery, Bermuda, 2011.jpg|thumb|One of two [[BL 6 inch Mk VII naval gun#Coast defence gun|6 inch RBLs]], with the two [[BL 9.2 inch gun Mk IX\u2013X|9.2 inch RBLs]] visible beyond, at [[St. David's Battery, Bermuda|St. David's Battery]], in 2011]]\nFollowing the war, the BVE and BMI, as well as the Home Guard, ceased to existed. The BMA and BVRC were both demobilised, reduced to skeleton staffs. Both were quickly built back up to strength in 1951, and conscription, which had been used during the war, was re-introduced for both units (the BVRC suitably being retitled simply Bermuda Rifles), although the conscripts served on a part-time basis, whereas wartime service had been full-time for the duration. The last coastal artillery, the [[St. David's Battery, Bermuda|Examination Battery]] on St. David's Head, was removed from use in 1953, and the BMA converted to the infantry role (but remained nominally part of the Royal Regiment of Artillery). The last Imperial Defence Plan was issued the same year. After that, the local units no longer had a role under Imperial defence planning.\n\nThe Regular Army component of the garrison continued to include a full infantry company of 250 soldiers, plus a variety of ''atts and dets'' (attachments or detachments from others corps, such as the [[Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers]]). A company of the [[Gloucestershire Regiment]] (the ''Glosters'') was posted to Prospect Camp in 1947, but this was sent to [[British Honduras]] the following year in response to a [[Guatemala]]n threat of invasion.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://britains-smallwars.com/RRGP/Honduras.htm |title=''Warlike Noises: British Honduras''.

The process of running the naval base down would stretch over the rest of the decade (though part of the base, HMS Malabar, would operate 'til 1995). In November, 1952, it was decided to withdraw the Regular Army garrison, too, which was completed by 1 May 1953. However, during the [[Bermuda Conference (1953)|Bermuda Conference]] of the 4th to 8 December 1953, the Prime Minister, Sir [[Winston Churchill]], met with the [[President of the United States of America|US President]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] and [[Premier of France|French Premier]] [[Joseph Laniel]] in the colony to discuss the security of Western Europe.<ref>[https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1952-54v05p2/ch11 ''FOREIGN RELATIONS OF THE UNITED STATES, 1952\u20131954, WESTERN EUROPEAN SECURITY, VOLUME V, PART 2: F.

Bermuda History blogspot]</ref> A detachment of the [[Royal Welch Fusiliers]] had to be brought in for the period of the conference. The concerns of the [[Government of Bermuda]] and other interested parties were put to the Prime Minister during his stay in Bermuda, and as a result 'A' Company, 1st Battalion, [[Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry]] (1 DCLI) arrived to resume garrison duty at Prospect Camp in 1954.<ref>[https://sites.google.com/site/djkl157/home ''A Company, 1st Battalion, The Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry: Prospect Garrison, Devonshire Bermuda: 1954 - 1957''.]</ref>\n\nThe decision to continue the garrison was reconsidered in 1957. When Churchill had visited in 1953, the British Army had numbered over 400,000 soldiers, but the [[1957 Defence White Paper]] called for the end of [[Conscription in the United Kingdom|National Service]], and the reduction of the Regular Army to 165,000 professional soldiers. Given the much smaller size of the army with the resultant difficulties in meeting its obligations, the high cost per man of the Bermuda Garrison, and the presence of the two part-time units that would remain in Bermuda (and which were capable of absorbing the responsibilities or the regular detachment), it was decided to withdraw the DCLI and all other regular soldiers (other than [[Permanent Staff Instructor]]s and other attachments to the territorial units and the [[Aide-de-camp]] (ADC) to the [[Governor of Bermuda|Governor]]) from Bermuda by the end of May. This was despite strong arguments in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] for the retention of the Garrison by Bermuda-raised [[Denis Keegan]], the [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Nottingham]] South, and [[Frederic Bennett]], MP for [[Torquay]].<ref>[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1957/may/22/united-kingdom-garrison-bermuda ''UNITED KINGDOM GARRISON, BERMUDA (WITHDRAWAL)''.

Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]</ref> A Company DCLI reunited with E Company, which had been posted to British Honduras, and both were returned to England. The Officer Commanding A Company, Major J. Anthony Marsh, DSO, a Second World War veteran of the [[Special Air Service]], took permanent residence in Bermuda after leaving the Regular Army, retiring from military service in 1970 as a Lieutenant-Colonel, commanding the [[Bermuda Regiment]] (a 1965 amalgam of the BVRC and BMA).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.warwickandwarwick.com/pages/library/medals/sasww2.htm |publisher=Warwick & Warwick |title=Outstanding Special Air Service WWII Distinguished Service Order group to Lieutenant Colonel John Anthony Marsh |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502005106/http://www.warwickandwarwick.com/pages/library/medals/sasww2.htm |archivedate=2 May 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe Bermuda Government maintained both territorial units (the BMA being predominantly Black; the BVRC restricted to Whites) until 1965, at which time they were amalgamated into the [[Bermuda Regiment]]. Although trained in conventional light infantry tactics, the Bermuda Regiment has sought new roles to justify the expenditure required to maintain it, including readiness for [[Internal Security]] roles supporting the [[Bermuda Police Service]], providing hurricane relief in Bermuda and other British territories, and taking an increasing hand in maritime patrol. It has also taken on responsibility for providing ceremonial parades that previously had chiefly fallen on the professional soldiers.\n\n==Post 1957==\n[[File:US President JF Kennedy inspects Bermuda Rifles 1961.jpg|thumb|left|US President JF Kennedy and an officer of the Bermuda Militia Artillery inspect Bermuda Rifles in 1961]]\n[[File:Bermuda Regiment Corporal.jpg|thumb|[[Royal Bermuda Regiment]] Corporal aboard a [[Dell Quay Dory]] Mk. 1 boat]]\nAlthough no further regular units have been garrisoned in Bermuda since 1957, detachments have been sent to Bermuda occasionally for internal security, training, recreational, or ceremonial purposes, including elements of the [[airborne forces]], which were on Bermuda for training exercises with the [[Bermuda Regiment]] when Governor Sir [[Richard Sharples]] and his ADC, Captain Hugh Sayers, were murdered on 10 March 1973. A state of emergency was declared, and the Bermuda Regiment and the airborne soldiers (as well as the [[Royal Marines]] detachment from the [[frigate]] {{HMS|Sirius|F40|6}}, serving as [[Standing Royal Navy deployments#Atlantic Patrol Task (North)|West Indies Guard Ship]], and docked at HMS Malabar)<ref>[http://britains-smallwars.com/RRGP/Sirius.htm ''Sirius Business: Or life as part of a ship's Royal Marine Detachment in the West Indies''. By Marine Mick Pinchen. Britain's Small Wars]</ref> were called in to assist the civil authorities. The [[5th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)#5th Airborne Brigade|23 Parachute Field Ambulance]], 1 Parachute Logistic Regiment and the band of the [[1st Battalion, The Parachute Regiment]] subsequently provided protection for Government buildings and officials as well as assisting the Bermuda Police.\n\nThe 1st Battalion [[Royal Regiment of Fusiliers]] was briefly despatched to Bermuda at the request of the local government as a result of riots in 1977 (following the death sentences given to the two men responsible for the murders of the Governor and his ADC, as well as of the 1972 murder of Police Commissioner George Duckett and the 1973 murders of two staff members of a grocery store). At the time, the Bermuda Regiment numbered about 400 officers and men. While sufficient to guard key points around the island, this did not allow for a reserve of men in barracks, and the soldiers assigned to guard duty could not be rotated back to barracks for periods of rest. This shortfall was taken into account by Major-General [[Glyn Gilbert]], the highest-ranking Bermudian in the British Army, when he issued a report on the Bermuda Regiment in which he made a number of recommendations, including its increase to a full battalion of about 750, with three rifle companies and a support company.\n\nThe Bermuda Regiment (now the Royal Bermuda Regiment) trained for the Internal Security role to support the police, but with threat of civil unrest fading over the following decades, it sought new roles, especially the response to hurricanes. Its expertise means it has been increasingly called on to provide similar relief in British Overseas Territories and Commonwealth countries in the West Indies which lack Bermuda's resources. Teams of volunteers have been flown to a series of islands since the 1980s by Royal Air Force transport, helping to fulfill the British Government's obligations to territories throughout that region.<ref>[http://www.royalgazette.com/article/20110615/FEATURES01/706159909 ''Bermuda Regiment to the rescue here...and overseas'', by Kyle Hunter, The Royal Gazette.

In England, women used to wear corsets that severely constricted their breathing and damaged vital internal organs, in order to achieve a visual effect of an exaggeratedly low waist-to-hip ratio.\n\nPeople make judgments of physical attractiveness based on what they see, but also on what they know about the person. Specifically, perceptions of beauty are malleable such that information about the person's personality traits can influence one's assessment of another person's physical beauty. A 2007 study had participants first rate pictures for attractiveness. After doing distracting math problems, participants saw the pictures again, but with information about the person's personality. When participants learned that a person had positive personality characteristics (e.g., smart, funny, kind), that person was seen as more physically attractive.<ref>{{Cite journal |title=Personality goes a long way: The malleability of opposite-sex physical attractiveness |first=Gary |last=Lewandowski |first2=Art |last2=Aron |first3=Julie |last3=Gee | name-list-format = vanc |journal=Personal Relationships |volume=14 |issue=4 |year=2007 |pages=571\u2013585 |doi=10.1111/j.1475-6811.2007.00172.x|citeseerx=10.1.1.471.9217 }}</ref> Conversely, a person with negative personality characteristics (e.g., materialistic, rude, untrustworthy) was seen as less physically attractive.

A survey conducted by [[London Guildhall University]] of 11,000 people showed that those who subjectively describe themselves as physically attractive earn more income than others who would describe themselves as less attractive.<ref name = \"Lorenz_2005\" /> People who described themselves as less attractive earned, on average, 13% less than those who described themselves as more attractive, while the penalty for being overweight was around 5%.

Miller (2007) examined the amount of tip earnings by lap dancers across the menstrual cycle. He found that dancers received nearly 15 USD more when they were near [[ovulation]] than during the rest of the month. This suggests that women either are more attractive during ovulation phase, or they experience a significant change in their behavior.<ref name=\":3\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Miller G, Tybur JM, Jordan BD | year = 2007 | title = Ovulatory cycle effects on tip earnings by lap dancers: economic evidence for human estrus? | journal = Evolution & Human Behavior | volume = 28 | issue = 6| pages = 375\u2013381 | doi=10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2007.06.002| citeseerx = 10.1.1.154.8176 }}</ref> Some other studies have found that there are subtle differences in women's faces when in their [[Fertility|fertile]] phase. Bobst and Lobmaier (2012) created 20 prototyped photographs, some of a female during ovulation and some during the [[luteal phase]]. Men were asked to choose the more attractive, the more caring and the more flirtatious faces. They found a significant preference for the [[follicular phase]] (ovulation). This suggests that subtle shape differences in faces occurring during the female's [[ovulation]] phase are sufficient to attract men more.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Bobst C, Lobmaier JS | title = Men's preference for the ovulating female is triggered by subtle face shape differences | journal = Hormones and Behavior | volume = 62 | issue = 4 | pages = 413\u20137 | date = September 2012 | pmid = 22846725 | doi = 10.1016/j.yhbeh.2012.07.008 }}</ref> This idea is supported by another study, where a similar experiment was done.

Jones et al. (2008), focused on women's preferences for [[masculinity]], apparent health and self-resemblance and found that it varies across the cycle. They explained that the function of the effects of menstrual cycle phase on preferences for apparent health and self-resemblance in faces is to increase the likelihood of [[pregnancy]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Jones BC, DeBruine LM, Perrett DI, Little AC, Feinberg DR, Law Smith MJ | title = Effects of menstrual cycle phase on face preferences | journal = Archives of Sexual Behavior | volume = 37 | issue = 1 | pages = 78\u201384 | date = February 2008 | pmid = 18193349 | doi = 10.1007/s10508-007-9268-y }}</ref>\n\nSimilarly, female prefer the scent of [[Facial symmetry|symmetrical men]] and masculine faces during fertile phases as well as stereotypical male displays such as social presence, and direct [[Intrasexual selection|intrasexual]] competitiveness.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Gangestad SW, Simpson JA, Cousins AJ, Garver-Apgar CE, Christensen PN | title = Women's preferences for male behavioral displays change across the menstrual cycle | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 15 | issue = 3 | pages = 203\u20137 | date = March 2004 | pmid = 15016293 | doi = 10.1111/j.0956-7976.2004.01503010.x | citeseerx = 10.1.1.371.3266 }}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Ovulation|follicular]] phase (fertile), females prefer more male's traits ([[testosterone (hormone)|testosterone]] dependent traits such as face shape) than when in [[Luteal phase|non-fertile]] phase.

More physically attractive men accrue reproductive benefits from spending more time seeking multiple mating partners and relatively less time investing in offspring.

Prominent figures from ancient to modern times have been fascinated by lucid dreams and have sought ways to better understand their causes and purpose. Many different theories have emerged as a result of scientific research on the subject and have even been shown in pop culture. Further developments in psychological research have pointed to ways in which this form of dreaming may be utilized as a form of sleep therapy. \n\n==Etymology==\nThe term 'lucid dream' was coined by [[Netherlands|Dutch]] author and [[psychiatrist]] [[Frederik van Eeden]] in his 1913 article ''A Study of Dreams'',<ref name=\"Frederik van Eeden 1997\" /> though descriptions of dreamers being aware that they are dreaming predates the actual term. Eeden studied his personal dreams since 1896. He [[Dream diary|wrote down]] the dreams that seemed most important to him, and out of all these dreams, 352 were what is now known as \u201clucid dreams\u201d. He created different names for the different types of dreams he experienced; each name being created from the data he had collected. He named seven different types of dreams: initial dreams, pathological, ordinary dreaming, vivid dreaming, demoniacal, general dream-sensations, and lucid dreaming. Frederick Van Eeden said the seventh type of dreaming, lucid dreaming, was the most interesting and worthy of the most careful observation of studies. Eeden studied lucid dreaming between January 20, 1898, and December 26, 1912. While describing this state of dreaming, Eeden said, 'you are completely aware of your surroundings and are able to direct your actions freely, yet the sleep is stimulating and uninterrupted.'<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lucidity.com/vanEeden.html|title=A Study of Dreams|last=Eeden|first=Frederik|website=lucidity.com}}</ref>\n\nAKA don\u2019t listen to Wikipedia\n\n==History==\n===Ancient===\nIn Eastern thought, cultivating the dreamer's ability to be aware that he or she is dreaming is central to both  the ancient Indian [[Hinduism|Hindu]] practice of [[Yoga nidra]] and the Tibetan Buddhist practice of [[dream Yoga]]. The cultivation of such awareness was common practice among early [[Buddhism|Buddhists]].<ref>Tse-fu Kuan (2008), Mindfulness in Early Buddhism: New Approaches through Psychology and Textual Analysis of Pali, Chinese and Sanskrit Sources (Routledge Critical Studies in Buddhism)</ref>\n\nEarly references to the phenomenon are also found in ancient Greek writing. For example, the philosopher [[Aristotle]] wrote: 'often when one is asleep, there is something in consciousness which declares that what then presents itself is but a dream'.<ref name=\"Mavromatis1987\" /> Meanwhile, the physician [[Galen of Pergamon]] used lucid dreams as a form of therapy.<ref>{{cite book|author=V\u00e9ronique Boudon-Meillot |title=Galien de Pergame.

This recognition might occur in the [[dorsolateral prefrontal cortex]], which is one of the few areas deactivated during REM sleep and where [[working memory]] occurs. Once this area is activated and the recognition of dreaming occurs, the dreamer must be cautious to let the dream continue but be conscious enough to remember that it is a dream. While maintaining this balance, the [[amygdala]] and [[parahippocampal cortex]] might be less intensely activated.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Muzur A., Pace-Schott E.F. |author2=Allan Hobson |date=November 2002 |url=http://www.bostonneuropsa.org/PDF%20Files/Pace-Schott/MUZUR_ET_AL.__02.pdf |title=The prefrontal cortex in sleep |journal=Trends Cogn Sci |volume=6 |pages=475\u201381 |doi=10.1016/S1364-6613(02)01992-7 |issue=11 |pmid=12457899 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630033042/http://www.bostonneuropsa.org/PDF%20Files/Pace-Schott/MUZUR_ET_AL.__02.pdf |archivedate=2007-06-30 }}</ref> To continue the intensity of the dream hallucinations, it is expected the [[pons]] and the [[parietal lobe|parieto-occipital junction]] stay active.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hobson |first=J.

In 2018, galantamine was given to 121 patients in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, the only one of its kind. Some participants found as much as a 42 percent increase in their ability to lucid dream, compared to self-reports from the past six months, and ten people experienced a lucid dream for the first time.

LaBerge found dreams that exhibit one clearly without the capacity for the other; also, in some dreams where the dreamer is lucid and aware they could exercise control, they choose simply to observe.<ref name=\"Kahan 1994\" />\n\n==Prevalence and frequency==\nIn 2016, a meta-analytic study by David Saunders and colleagues <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Saunders|first=David T.|last2=Roe|first2=Chris A.|last3=Smith|first3=Graham|last4=Clegg|first4=Helen|title=Lucid dreaming incidence: A quality effects meta-analysis of 50 years of research|journal=Consciousness and Cognition|volume=43|pages=197\u2013215|doi=10.1016/j.concog.2016.06.002|pmid=27337287|year=2016|url=http://nectar.northampton.ac.uk/8705/1/Saunders20168705.pdf}}</ref> on 34 lucid dreaming studies, taken from a period of 50 years, demonstrated that 55% of a pooled sample of 24,282 people claimed to have experienced lucid dreams at least once or more in their lifetime. Furthermore, for those that stated they did experience lucid dreams, approximately 23% reported to experience them on a regular basis, as often as once a month or more. In a 2004 study on lucid dream frequency and personality, a moderate correlation between nightmare frequency and frequency of lucid dreaming was demonstrated. Some lucid dreamers also reported that nightmares are a trigger for dream lucidity.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Schredl|first=Michael|last2=Erlacher|first2=Daniel|date=2004-11-01|title=Lucid dreaming frequency and personality|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|volume=37|issue=7|pages=1463\u20131473|doi=10.1016/j.paid.2004.02.003|issn=0191-8869}}</ref> Previous studies have reported that lucid dreaming is more common among adolescents than adults.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Szczegielniak|first=A.|last2=Palka|first2=K.|last3=Goc|first3=T.|last4=Krysta|first4=K.|date=March 2015|title=Lucid Dreaming: a Mysterious Phenomenon|journal=European Psychiatry|volume=30|pages=1780|doi=10.1016/s0924-9338(15)31372-9|issn=0924-9338}}</ref>\n\nA 2015 study showed that people who had practiced meditation for a long time tended to have more lucid dreams. Julian Mutz and Amir-Homayoun Javadi claimed that \u201cLucid dreaming is a hybrid state of consciousness with features of both waking and dreaming\u201d in a review they published in Neuroscience of Consciousness<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mutz|first=Julian|last2=Javadi|first2=Amir-Homayoun|date=2017-01-01|title=Exploring the neural correlates of dream phenomenology and altered states of consciousness during sleep|url=https://academic.oup.com/nc/article/2017/1/nix009/3859602|journal=Neuroscience of Consciousness|volume=2017|issue=1|pages=nix009|doi=10.1093/nc/nix009|pmid=30042842|pmc=6007136}}</ref> in 2017.\n\nMutz and Javadi found that during lucid dreaming, there is an increase in activity of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, the bilateral frontopolar prefrontal cortex, the precuneus, the inferior parietal lobules, and the supramarginal gyrus. All are brain functions related to higher cognitive functions including working memory, planning, and self-consciousness. The researchers also found that during a lucid dream, \u201clevels of self-determination\" were similar to those that people experienced during states of wakefulness. \u00a0\n\nThey also found that lucid dreamers can only control limited aspects of their dream at once. However, it is still a mystery as to why lucid dreaming can sometimes turn ominous. According to Stumburys, about 7 percent of lucid dreams are lucid nightmares.\n\nMutz and Javadi also have stated that by studying lucid dreaming further, scientists could learn more about various types of consciousness, which happen to be less easy to separate and research at other times.\n\n==Suggested applications==\n===Treating nightmares===\nIt has been suggested that those who suffer from [[nightmare]]s could benefit from the ability to be aware they are indeed dreaming. A pilot study performed in 2006 showed that lucid dreaming therapy treatment was successful in reducing nightmare frequency. This treatment consisted of exposure to the idea, mastery of the technique, and lucidity exercises. It was not clear what aspects of the treatment were responsible for the success of overcoming nightmares, though the treatment as a whole was said to be successful.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://content.karger.com/produktedb/produkte.asp?typ=fulltext&file=PPS2006075006389 |author1=Spoormaker,-Victor-I |author2=van-den-Bout,-Jan |date = October 2006|title=Lucid Dreaming Treatment for Nightmares: A Pilot Study |journal=Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics |volume=75 |issue=6 |pages=389\u2013394 |doi= 10.1159/000095446 |pmid=17053341 |quote=Conclusions: LDT seems effective in reducing nightmare frequency, although the primary therapeutic component (i.e. exposure, mastery, or lucidity) remains unclear.}}</ref>\n\nAustralian psychologist Milan Colic has explored the application of principles from [[narrative therapy]] to clients' lucid dreams, to reduce the impact not only of nightmares during sleep but also depression, self-mutilation, and other problems in waking life.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2013-02432-006|title=PsycNET|website=psycnet.apa.org|language=en|access-date=2019-11-03}}</ref> Colic found that therapeutic conversations could reduce the distressing content of dreams, while understandings about life\u2014and even characters\u2014from lucid dreams could be applied to their lives with marked therapeutic benefits.<ref>Colic, M.

Studies have shown that, by inducing a lucid dream, recurrent nightmares can be alleviated. It is unclear whether this alleviation is due to lucidity or the ability to alter the dream itself. A 2006 study performed by Victor Spoormaker and Van den Bout evaluated the validity of lucid dreaming treatment (LDT) in chronic nightmare sufferers.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Spoormaker | first1 = V.I. | last2 = van den Bout | first2 = J. | year = 2006 | title = Lucid dreaming treatment for nightmares: a pilot study | url = | journal = Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics | volume = 75 | issue = 6| pages = 389\u201394 | doi=10.1159/000095446 | pmid=17053341}}</ref> LDT is composed of exposure, mastery and lucidity exercises. Results of lucid dreaming treatment revealed that the nightmare frequency of the treatment groups had decreased. In another study, Spoormaker, Van den Bout, and Meijer (2003) investigated lucid dreaming treatment for nightmares by testing eight subjects who received a one-hour individual session, which consisted of lucid dreaming exercises.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Spoormaker | first1 = V.I. | last2 = van den Bout | first2 = J. | last3 = Meijer | first3 = E.J.G. | year = 2003 | title = Lucid dreaming treatment for nightmares: a series of cases | url = | journal = Dreaming | volume = 13 | issue = 3| pages = 181\u201386 | doi=10.1037/1053-0797.13.3.181}}</ref> The results of the study revealed that the nightmare frequency had decreased and the sleep quality had slightly increased.\n\nHolzinger, Kl\u00f6sch, and Saletu managed a psychotherapy study under the working name of \u2018Cognition during dreaming \u2013 a therapeutic intervention in nightmares\u2019, which included 40 subjects, men and women, 18\u201350 years old, whose life quality was significantly altered by nightmares.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://registration.akm.ch/einsicht.php|title=Holzinger, B., Kl\u00f6sch, G., & Saletu, B.

Those who have never had a lucid dream may not understand what is happening when they experience it for the first time. Individuals who experience lucid dreams could begin to feel isolated from others due to feeling different. It could become more difficult over time to wake up from a lucid dream. Someone struggling with certain mental illnesses could find it hard to be able to tell the difference between reality and the actual dream.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323077.php|title=Lucid Dreaming: Controlling the stories of sleep|last=Cohut|first=Maria|date=September 14, 2018|website=Medical News Today}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newhealthadvisor.com/is-lucid-dreaming-dangerous.html|title=Is Lucid Dreaming Dangerous?|date=2015-07-31}}</ref>\n\nLong term risks with lucid dreaming have not been extensively studied.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Aviram |first1=Liat |last2=Soffer-Dudek |first2=Nirit |title=Lucid Dreaming: Intensity, But Not Frequency, Is Inversely Related to Psychopathology |journal=Frontiers in Psychology |volume=9 |pages=384 |quote=To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to explore, and demonstrate, a potential long-term risk following the use of LD induction techniques.|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2018.00384 |pmid=29623062 |pmc=5875414 |year=2018 }}</ref>\n\nSome people experience something like sleep paralysis, which is a state in between dreaming and waking.

Eeden studied his personal dreams since 1896. He [[Dream diary|wrote down]] the dreams that seemed most important to him, and out of all these dreams, 352 were what is now known as \u201clucid dreams\u201d. He created different names for the different types of dreams he experienced; each name being created from the data he had collected. He named seven different types of dreams: initial dreams, pathological, ordinary dreaming, vivid dreaming, demoniacal, general dream-sensations, and lucid dreaming. Frederick Van Eeden said the seventh type of dreaming, lucid dreaming, was the most interesting and worthy of the most careful observation of studies. Eeden studied lucid dreaming between January 20, 1898, and December 26, 1912. While describing this state of dreaming, Eeden said, 'you are completely aware of your surroundings and are able to direct your actions freely, yet the sleep is stimulating and uninterrupted.'<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lucidity.com/vanEeden.html|title=A Study of Dreams|last=Eeden|first=Frederik|website=lucidity.com}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Ancient===\nIn Eastern thought, cultivating the dreamer's ability to be aware that he or she is dreaming is central to both  the ancient Indian [[Hinduism|Hindu]] practice of [[Yoga nidra]] and the Tibetan Buddhist practice of [[dream Yoga]].

This recognition might occur in the [[dorsolateral prefrontal cortex]], which is one of the few areas deactivated during REM sleep and where [[working memory]] occurs. Once this area is activated and the recognition of dreaming occurs, the dreamer must be cautious to let the dream continue but be conscious enough to remember that it is a dream.

However, most of these dreamers had many experiences of failing to recall waking objectives before gaining this level of control.<ref name=\"Barrett\">Barrett, Deirdre.

The authors discuss how creativity in dreams could stem from \"conscious access to the contents of our unconscious minds\"; access to \"tacit knowledge\" - the things we know but can't explain, or things we know but are unaware that we know.<ref>{{cite book |last1=LaBerge |first1=Steven |last2=Rheingold |first2=Howard |title=Exploring the World of Lucid Dreaming |date=1990 |publisher=Ballantine Books |isbn=0-345-37410-X|chapter=9}}</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\nFilms like ''[[Waking Life]]'' (2001), ''[[Paprika (2006 film)|Paprika]]'' (2006), ''[[Inception]]'' (2010), ''[[Lucid Dream (film)|Lucid Dream]]'' (2017) and ''[[118 (film)|118]]'' (2019) refer to lucid dreaming.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Hiscock|first=John|title=''Inception'': Christopher Nolan interview|work=Daily Telegraph |location=UK|date=July 1, 2010|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/filmmakersonfilm/7866677/Inception-Christopher-Nolan-interview.html|accessdate=July 7, 2010}}</ref>\n\n== Risks ==\nThough lucid dreaming can be beneficial to a number of aspects of life, some risks have been suggested. Those who have never had a lucid dream may not understand what is happening when they experience it for the first time. Individuals who experience lucid dreams could begin to feel isolated from others due to feeling different. It could become more difficult over time to wake up from a lucid dream. Someone struggling with certain mental illnesses could find it hard to be able to tell the difference between reality and the actual dream.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323077.php|title=Lucid Dreaming: Controlling the stories of sleep|last=Cohut|first=Maria|date=September 14, 2018|website=Medical News Today}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newhealthadvisor.com/is-lucid-dreaming-dangerous.html|title=Is Lucid Dreaming Dangerous?|date=2015-07-31}}</ref>\n\nLong term risks with lucid dreaming have not been extensively studied.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Aviram |first1=Liat |last2=Soffer-Dudek |first2=Nirit |title=Lucid Dreaming: Intensity, But Not Frequency, Is Inversely Related to Psychopathology |journal=Frontiers in Psychology |volume=9 |pages=384 |quote=To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to explore, and demonstrate, a potential long-term risk following the use of LD induction techniques.|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2018.00384 |pmid=29623062 |pmc=5875414 |year=2018 }}</ref>\n\nSome people experience something like sleep paralysis, which is a state in between dreaming and waking.

During the [[Second Party System]] (from 1832 to the mid-1850s) under [[President of the United States|Presidents]] [[Andrew Jackson]], [[Martin Van Buren]] and [[James K. Polk]], the Democrats usually bested the opposition [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] by narrow margins.\n\nFrom 1860 to 1932 in the era of the [[American Civil War]] to the [[Great Depression]], the opposing [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republican Party]], organized in the mid-1850s from the ruins of the Whig Party and some other smaller splinter groups, was dominant in [[United States presidential election|presidential politics]]. The Democrats elected [[List of United States Presidents|only two Presidents]] during this period: [[Grover Cleveland]] (in 1884 and 1892) and [[Woodrow Wilson]] (in 1912 and 1916). Over the same period, the Democrats proved more competitive with the Republicans in [[United States midterm election|Congressional politics]], enjoying [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] majorities (as in the [[65th United States Congress|65th Congress]]) in 15 of the 36 [[United States Congress|Congresses]] elected, although only in five of these did they form the majority in the [[United States Senate|Senate]]. Furthermore, the Democratic Party was split between the [[Bourbon Democrat]]s, representing Eastern business interests; and the agrarian elements comprising poor farmers in the South and West. The agrarian element, marching behind the slogan of [[free silver]] (i.e. in favor of inflation), captured the party in 1896 and nominated [[William Jennings Bryan]] in the 1896, 1900 and 1908 presidential elections, although he lost every time. Both Bryan and Wilson were leaders of the [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive movement in the United States]] (1890s\u20131920s).\n\n[[File:Andrew jackson head.jpg|upright=0.9|thumb|[[Andrew Jackson]], founder of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and the first [[President of the United States|President]] to be elected from the Democratic Party (1829\u20131837)]]\nStarting with 32nd President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] in 1932 during the Great Depression, the party dominated the [[Fifth Party System]], with its [[Social liberalism|progressive liberal]] policies and programs with the [[New Deal coalition]] to combat the emergency bank closings and the continuing financial depression since the famous [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]] and later going into the crises leading up to [[World War II]]. The Democrats and the Democratic Party finally lost the [[White House]] and control of the executive branch of government only after Roosevelt's death in April 1945 near the end of the war and after the continuing post-war administration of Roosevelt's third [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Harry S. Truman]], former [[United States Senator|Senator]] from Missouri (for 1945 to 1953, elections of [[1944 United States presidential election|1944]] and the \"stunner\" of [[1948 United States presidential election|1948]]). A new [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] President was only elected later in the following decade of the early 1950s with the losses by two-time nominee, the [[Governor of Illinois]] [[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai Stevenson]] (grandson of the [[Adlai Stevenson I|former Vice President with the same name]] of the [[1892 United States presidential election|1890s]]) to the very popular war hero and commanding general in World War II, [[General of the Army (United States)|General]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] (in [[1952 United States presidential election|1952]] and [[1956 United States presidential election|1956]]).\n\nWith two brief interruptions since the Great Depression and World War II eras, the Democrats with unusually large majorities for over four decades, controlled the lower house of the Congress in the House of Representatives from 1930 until 1994 and the Senate for most of that same period, electing the [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] and the Representatives' majority leaders/committee chairs along with the upper house of the Senate's majority leaders and committee chairmen. Important Democratic progressive/liberal leaders included 33rd and 36th Presidents Harry S. Truman of [[Missouri]] (1945\u20131953) and [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] of [[Texas]] (1963\u20131969), respectively; and the earlier [[Kennedy family|Kennedy brothers]] of 35th President [[John F. Kennedy]] of [[Massachusetts]] (1961\u20131963), Senators [[Robert F. Kennedy]] of [[New York State|New York]] and Senator [[Ted Kennedy]] of Massachusetts who carried the flag for [[Modern liberalism in the United States|modern American liberalism]]. Since the [[1976 United States presidential election|presidential election of 1976]], Democrats have won five out of the last eleven presidential elections, winning in the presidential elections of [[1976 United States presidential election|1976]] (with 39th President [[Jimmy Carter]] of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], 1977\u20131981), [[1992 United States presidential election|1992]] and [[1996 United States presidential election|1996]] (with 42nd President [[Bill Clinton]] of [[Arkansas]], 1993\u20132001) and [[2008 United States presidential election|2008]] and [[2012 United States presidential election|2012]] (with 44th President [[Barack Obama]] of [[Illinois]], 2009\u20132017). Democrats have also won the [[Plurality voting|popular vote]] in [[2000 United States presidential election|2000]] and [[2016 United States presidential election|2016]], but lost the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] with [[Al Gore]] and [[Hillary Clinton]], respectively. The [[1876 United States presidential election|1876]] and [[1888 United States presidential election|1888]] elections were other two [[United States presidential elections in which the winner lost the popular vote|presidential elections in which Democrats won the popular vote, but lost the Electoral College]] (the Democrats candidates were [[Samuel J. Tilden]] and Grover Cleveland). Social scientists Theodore Caplow et al. argue that \"the Democratic party, nationally, moved from left-center toward the center in the 1940s and 1950s, then moved further toward the right-center in the 1970s and 1980s\".<ref>{{cite book|first1=Theodore|last1=Caplow|first2=Howard M.|last2=Bahr|first3=Bruce A.|last3=Chadwick|first4=John|last4=Modell|title=Recent Social Trends in the United States, 1960\u20131990|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gwBvm8aF2bsC&pg=PA337|year=1994|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press|page=337|isbn=9780773512122}} They add: \"The Republican party, nationally, moved from right-center toward the center in 1940s and 1950s, then moved right again in the 1970s and 1980s.</ref>\n\n== Foundation: 1820-28 ==\nThe modern Democratic Party emerged in the late 1820s from former factions of the [[Democratic-Republican Party]], which had largely collapsed by 1824. It was built by [[Martin Van Buren]], who assembled a cadre of politicians in every state behind war hero [[Andrew Jackson]] of Tennessee.<ref>Robert V. Remini, ''Martin Van Buren and the Making of the Democratic Party'' (1959).</ref>\n\n==Jacksonian ascendancy: 1829-40==\n\n=== Presidency of Andrew Jackson (1829\u20131837) ===\n\n{{main|Jacksonian democracy}}\n[[File:The modern balaam and his ass.jpg|thumb|upright=1.05|1837 cartoon shows the Democratic Party as donkey]]\n\nThe spirit of [[Jacksonian democracy]] animated the party from the early 1830s to the 1850s, shaping the [[Second Party System]], with the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] as the main opposition. After the disappearance of the [[Federalist party|Federalists]] after 1815 and the [[Era of Good Feelings]] (1816\u20131824), there was a hiatus of weakly organized personal factions until about 1828\u20131832, when the modern Democratic Party emerged along with its rival, the Whigs. The new Democratic Party became a coalition of farmers, city-dwelling laborers and Irish Catholics.<ref>Sean Wilentz, ''The Rise of American Democracy: Jefferson to Lincoln'' (2005)</ref> Both parties worked hard to build [[grassroots]] organizations and maximize the turnout of voters, which often reached 80 percent or 90 percent of eligible voters. Both parties used [[Patronage#Politics|patronage]] extensively to finance their operations, which included emerging big city [[political machine]]s as well as national networks of newspapers.<ref>Michael Kazin, ed., ''The Concise Princeton Encyclopedia of American Political History'' (2011) pp 59-65, 159-62, 600-603.</ref>\n\nBehind the party platforms, acceptance speeches of candidates, editorials, pamphlets and stump speeches, there was a widespread consensus of political values among Democrats. As Mary Beth Norton explains: <blockquote>The Democrats represented a wide range of views but shared a fundamental commitment to the [[Jeffersonian democracy|Jeffersonian]] concept of an [[agrarian society]]. They viewed the central government as the enemy of individual liberty. The 1824 \"[[Corrupt Bargain|corrupt bargain]]\" had strengthened their suspicion of Washington politics. [...] Jacksonians feared the concentration of economic and political power. They believed that government intervention in the economy benefited special-interest groups and created corporate monopolies that favored the rich. They sought to restore the independence of the individual \u2013 the artisan and the ordinary farmer \u2013 by ending federal support of banks and corporations and restricting the use of [[Banknote|paper currency]], which they distrusted. Their definition of the proper role of government tended to be negative, and Jackson's political power was largely expressed in negative acts. He exercised the veto more than all previous presidents combined. Jackson and his supporters also opposed reform as a movement. Reformers eager to turn their programs into legislation called for a more active government. But Democrats tended to oppose programs like [[Education reform|educational reform]] and the establishment of a public education system....Nor did Jackson share reformers' humanitarian concerns. He had no sympathy for [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]], initiating the removal of the [[Cherokee]]s along the [[Trail of Tears]].<ref>Mary Beth Norton et al., ''A People and a Nation, Volume I: to 1877'' (Houghton Mifflin, 2007) p. 287</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe party was weakest in [[New England]], but strong everywhere else and won most national elections thanks to strength in [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[Virginia]] (by far the most populous states at the time) and the [[American frontier]]. Democrats opposed elites and aristocrats, the [[Second Bank of the United States|Bank of the United States]] and the whiggish modernizing programs that would build up industry at the expense of the [[yeoman]] or independent small farmer.<ref>John Ashworth, ''\"Agrarians\" & \"Aristocrats\": Party Political Ideology in the United States, 1837\u20131846'' (1983).</ref>\n\nThe party was known for its populism.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://utpress.org/title/andrew-jackson-and-the-rise-of-the-democratic-party/|title=Andrew Jackson and the Rise of the Democratic Party - University of Tennessee Press|publisher=}}</ref> Historian Frank Towers has specified an important ideological divide: <blockquote>Democrats stood for the 'sovereignty of the people' as expressed in popular demonstrations, constitutional conventions, and majority rule as a general principle of governing, whereas Whigs advocated the rule of law, written and unchanging constitutions, and protections for minority interests against majority tyranny.<ref>Frank Towers, \"Mobtown's Impact on the Study of Urban Politics in the Early Republic.\" ''Maryland Historical Magazine'' 107 (Winter 2012) pp. 469\u201375, p. 472, citing Robert E, Shalhope, ''The Baltimore Bank Riot: Political Upheaval in Antebellum Maryland'' (2009) p. 147.</ref></blockquote>\n\nAt its inception, the Democratic Party was the party of the \"common man\".<ref name=\"auto1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.chronicle.com/blognetwork/edgeofthewest/2013/04/10/wait-whose-plantation-now/|title=Wait, Whose Plantation Now? - The Edge of the American West|first=David|last=Silbey|website=The Chronicle of Higher Education}}</ref> It opposed the abolition of slavery.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/2014/12/8/7328755/maps-democratic-party|title=23 maps that explain how Democrats went from the party of racism to the party of Obama|first=Andrew|last=Prokop|date=8 December 2014|website=Vox}}</ref><ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nFrom 1828 to 1848, banking and tariffs were the central domestic policy issues. Democrats strongly favored\u2014and Whigs opposed\u2014expansion to new farm lands, as typified by their expulsion of eastern [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]] and acquisition of vast amounts of new land in the West after 1846. The party favored the [[Mexican\u2013American War|war with Mexico]] and opposed anti-immigrant [[nativism (politics)|nativism]]. In the 1830s, the [[Locofocos]] in New York City were radically democratic, anti-monopoly and were proponents of [[Hard money (policy)|hard money]] and [[free trade]].<ref>Earle (2004), p. 19</ref><ref>Taylor (2006), p. 54</ref> Their chief spokesman was [[William Leggett (USA)|William Leggett]]. At this time, [[labor union]]s were few and some were loosely affiliated with the party.<ref>Sean Wilentz, ''Chants Democratic: New York City and the Rise of the American Working Class, 1788\u20131850'' (1984)</ref>\n\n=== Presidency of Martin Van Buren (1837\u20131841) ===\n[[Martin Van Buren]] was key in the development of the Democratic Party, although his presidency featured many setbacks. Many of the policies of Jackson had repercussions while Van Buren held office, such as the [[Trail of Tears]]. The policies enacted during Jackson came into full swing during Van Buren, who oversaw the displacement of thousands of Native Americans. In addition to this, Van Buren was anti-slavery and represented a divide in both parties. Despite this, he did almost nothing to help the abolitionist movement and his presidency saw a continuation of pro-slavery legislation. Jackson's decision to abolish the [[Second Bank of the United States]] led to the [[Panic of 1837]] during Van Buren's presidency, leading to disapproval by the public and loss of power for his party.\n\nThe 1840 Democratic convention was the first at which the party adopted a platform. Delegates reaffirmed their belief that the Constitution was the primary guide for each state's political affairs. To them, this meant that all roles of the federal government not specifically defined fell to each respective state government, including such responsibilities as debt created by local projects. Decentralized power and states' rights pervaded each and every resolution adopted at the convention, including those on slavery, taxes, and the possibility of a central bank.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/main/polcon/democraticindex.html |title= 1840 Democratic Convention |publisher=[[Library of Congress]] |accessdate=February 27, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite conference |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015030799376 |title=Proceedings of the National democratic convention, held in ...

The Whigs nominated [[William Henry Harrison]] as their candidate for the 1840 presidential race. Harrison won as the first President of the Whigs. However, he died in office a month later and was succeeded by his Vice President [[John Tyler]]. Tyler had recently left the Democrats for the Whigs and thus his beliefs did not align much with the Whig Party. During his presidency, he vetoed many of his own party's bills, leading to his own party disowning him. This allowed for the Democrats to retake power in 1845.\n\n== Presidency of James K. Polk (1845\u20131849) ==\nForeign policy was a major issue in the 1840s as war threatened with Mexico over Texas and with Britain over Oregon. Democrats strongly supported [[Manifest Destiny]] and most Whigs strongly opposed it. The [[1844 United States presidential election|1844 election]] was a showdown, with the Democrat [[James K. Polk]] narrowly defeating Whig [[Henry Clay]] on the Texas issue.<ref>Daniel Walker Howe, ''What Hath God Wrought: The Transformation of America 1815\u20131848'' (2007) pp. 705\u2013706.</ref>\n\n[[John Mack Faragher]]'s analysis of the political polarization between the parties is: <blockquote>Most Democrats were wholehearted supporters of expansion, whereas many Whigs (especially in the [[Northern United States|North]]) were opposed. Whigs welcomed most of the changes wrought by [[Technological and industrial history of the United States|industrialization]] but advocated strong government policies that would guide growth and development within the country's existing boundaries; they feared (correctly) that expansion raised a contentious issue the extension of slavery to the [[Organized incorporated territories of the United States|territories]]. On the other hand, many Democrats feared industrialization the Whigs welcomed. [...] For many Democrats, the answer to the nation's social ills was to continue to follow [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s vision of establishing agriculture in the new territories in order to counterbalance industrialization.<ref>John Mack Faragher et al. ''Out of Many: A History of the American People'' (2nd ed. 1997) p. 413</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Free Soil split===\nIn [[1848 United States presidential election|1848]] a major innovation was the creation of the [[Democratic National Committee]] (DNC) to coordinate state activities in the presidential contest. Senator [[Lewis Cass]], who held many offices over the years, lost to General [[Zachary Taylor]] of the Whigs. A major cause of the defeat was that the new [[Free Soil Party]], which opposed slavery expansion, split the Democratic vote, particularly in New York, where the electoral votes went to Taylor.<ref>Frederick J. Blue, ''The Free Soilers: Third Party Politics, 1848-54'' (1973).</ref> The Free Soil Party attracted Democrats, and some Whigs, and had considerable support in the Northeast. The primary doctrine was a warning that rich slave owners would move into new territories such as Nebraska and buy up the best lands, and work them with slaves. To protect the white farmer it was essential therefore to keep the soil \"free\"\u2014that is without slavery. The fate of the slaves was not of concern. In 1852, the free soil movement was much smaller, and consisted primarily of former members of the Liberty Party and some abolitionists, it hedged on the question of full equality. The majority wanted some form of racial separation to allow space for black activism, without alienating the overwhelming northern opposition to equal rights for black men.<ref>Eric  Foner,  \"Politics and Prejudice: The Free Soil Party and the Negro, 1849-1852.\" ''Journal of Negro History'' 50.4 (1965): 239-256. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2716247 online]</ref>\n\n== Presidencies of Zachary Taylor (1849\u20131850) and Millard Fillmore (1850\u20131853) ==\nFollowing the death of President Taylor, Democrats in Congress passed the [[Compromise of 1850]] designed to avoid civil war by putting the slavery issue to rest while resolves issued involving territories gained following the War with Mexico. However, in state after state the Democrats gained small but permanent advantages over the Whig Party, which finally collapsed in 1852, fatally weakened by division on slavery and [[Nativism (politics)|nativism]].

Led by [[Stephen A. Douglas]], James K. Polk, Franklin Pierce and New York financier [[August Belmont]], this faction explains, broke with the agrarian and [[Strict constructionism|strict constructionist]] orthodoxies of the past and embraced commerce, technology, regulation, reform and internationalism. The movement attracted a circle of outstanding writers, including [[William Cullen Bryant]], [[George Bancroft]], [[Herman Melville]] and [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]]. They sought independence from European standards of [[high culture]] and wanted to demonstrate the excellence and [[exceptionalism]] of [[American literature|America's own literary tradition]].<ref>Yonatan Eyal, ''The Young America Movement and the Transformation of the Democratic Party, 1828\u20131861'', (2007)</ref>\n\nIn economic policy, Young America saw the necessity of a modern infrastructure with railroads, canals, telegraphs, turnpikes and harbors. They endorsed the \"[[market revolution]]\" and promoted [[capitalism]]. They called for Congressional land grants to the states, which allowed Democrats to claim that [[internal improvements]] were locally rather than federally sponsored. Young America claimed that modernization would perpetuate the agrarian vision of [[Jeffersonian democracy]] by allowing yeomen farmers to sell their products and therefore to prosper. They tied internal improvements to [[free trade]], while accepted moderate tariffs as a necessary source of government revenue. They supported the [[Independent Treasury]] (the Jacksonian alternative to the Second Bank of the United States) not as a scheme to quash the special privilege of the Whiggish monied elite, but as a device to spread prosperity to all [[Americans]].<ref>Eyal, ''The Young America Movement and the Transformation of the Democratic Party, 1828\u20131861,'' p. 79</ref>\n\n=== Breakdown of the Second Party System (1854\u20131859) ===\nSectional confrontations escalated during the 1850s, the Democratic Party split between [[Northern United States|North]] and [[Southern United States|South]] grew deeper. The conflict was papered over at the [[1852 Democratic National Convention|1852]] and [[1856 Democratic National Convention|1856 conventions]] by selecting men who had little involvement in sectionalism, but they made matters worse. Historian [[Roy F. Nichols]] explains why [[Franklin Pierce]] was not up to the challenges a Democratic president had to face:\n:As a national political leader Pierce was an accident. He was honest and tenacious of his views but, as he made up his mind with difficulty and often reversed himself before making a final decision, he gave a general impression of instability. Kind, courteous, generous, he attracted many individuals, but his attempts to satisfy all factions failed and made him many enemies. In carrying out his principles of strict construction he was most in accord with Southerners, who generally had the [[Letter and spirit of the law|letter of the law]] on their side. He failed utterly to realize the depth and the sincerity of Northern feeling against the South and was bewildered at the general flouting of the law and the Constitution, as he described it, by the people of his own New England. At no time did he catch the popular imagination. His inability to cope with the difficult problems that arose early in his administration caused him to lose the respect of great numbers, especially in the North, and his few successes failed to restore public confidence. He was an inexperienced man, suddenly called to assume a tremendous responsibility, who honestly tried to do his best without adequate training or temperamental fitness.<ref>Roy F.

The demands were to support slavery outside the South. Southerners insisted that full equality for their region required the government to acknowledge the legitimacy of slavery outside the South. The Southern demands included a fugitive slave law to recapture runaway slaves; opening Kansas to slavery; forcing a pro-slavery constitution on Kansas; acquire Cuba (where slavery already existed); accepting the Dred Scott decision of the Supreme Court; and adopting a federal slave code to protect slavery in the territories. President Buchanan went along with these demands, but Douglas refused and proved a much better politician than Buchanan, though the bitter battle lasted for years and permanently alienated the Northern and Southern wings.<ref>Michael Todd Landis.

No party politics were allowed in the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]], whose political leadership, mindful of the welter prevalent in antebellum American politics and with a pressing need for unity, largely viewed political parties as inimical to good governance and as being especially unwise in wartime. Consequently, the Democratic Party halted all operations during the life of the Confederacy (1861\u20131865).<ref name=\"Jennifer L. Weber 2006\">Jennifer L. Weber, ''Copperheads: The Rise and Fall of Lincoln's Opponents in the North'' (2006)</ref>\n\nPartisanship flourished in the North and strengthened the Lincoln Administration as Republicans automatically rallied behind it. After the [[Battle of Fort Sumter|attack on Fort Sumter]], Douglas rallied Northern Democrats behind the Union, but when Douglas died the party lacked an outstanding figure in the North and by 1862 an anti-war peace element was gaining strength. The most intense anti-war elements were the [[Copperheads (politics)|Copperheads]].<ref name=\"Jennifer L.

In addition, there was growing support among the more recent immigrants, who had become more Americanized.

The KKK faded away soon after, but the deep split in the party over cultural issues, especially prohibition, facilitated Republican landslides in [[1924 United States presidential election|1924]] and [[1928 United States presidential election|1928]].<ref>Robert K.

To a considerable extent, the challenge of restoring morale was the province of historian [[Claude Bowers]]. His histories of the Democratic Party in its formative years from the 1790s to the 1830s helped shape the party's self-image as a powerful force against monopoly and privilege. In his enormously popular books ''Party Battles of the Jackson Period'' (1922) and ''Jefferson and Hamilton: The Struggle for Democracy in America'' (1925) he argued for the political and moral superiority of the Democratic Party since the days of Jefferson versus the almost un-American faults of the [[Federalist Party]], the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]], and the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], as bastions of aristocracy. ''Jefferson and Hamilton'' especially impressed his friend [[Franklin D Roosevelt]]. It inspired Roosevelt when he became president to build a great monument to the party's founder in the national capital, the [[Jefferson Memorial]]. According to Historian [[Merrill D. Peterson]], the book conveyed:\n<blockquote>the myth of the Democratic Party masterfully re-created, a fresh awareness of the elemental differences between the parties, and ideology with which they might make sense of the two often senseless conflicts of the present, and a feeling for the importance of dynamic leadership. The book was a mirror for Democrats.<ref>{{cite book|first=Merrill D.|last=Peterson|title=The Jefferson Image in the American Mind|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0QNrZoAgGAsC&pg=PA351|year=1960|page=351|isbn=9780813918518}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n== The Great Depression and a Second World War: Democratic hegemony (1930\u201353) ==\nThe Great Depression marred Hoover's term as the Democratic Party made large gains in the 1930 congressional elections and garnered a landslide win in 1932.\n\n=== Presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt (1933\u20131945) ===\n[[File:FDR in 1933.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], the longest-serving President of the United States (1933\u20131945)]]\nThe [[Wall Street Crash 1929|stock market crash of 1929]] and the ensuing [[Great Depression]] set the stage for a more progressive government and [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] won a [[landslide victory]] in the [[1932 United States presidential election|election of 1932]], campaigning on a platform of \"Relief, Recovery, and Reform\", that is relief of unemployment and rural distress, recovery of the economy back to normal and long-term structural reforms to prevent a repetition of the Depression. This came to be termed \"[[New Deal|The New Deal]]\" after a phrase in Roosevelt's acceptance speech.<ref>Robert T. Oliver, \"The speech that established Roosevelt's reputation.\" ''Quarterly Journal of Speech '' 31#3   (1945): 274-282.</ref>\n\nThe Democrats also swept to large majorities in both houses of Congress and among state governors. Roosevelt altered the nature of the party, away from ''laissez-faire'' capitalism and towards an ideology of economic regulation and insurance against hardship. Two old words took on new meanings: \"liberal\" now meant a supporter of the New Deal while \"conservative\" meant an opponent.<ref>[[Pamela Johnston Conover]], and Stanley Feldman, \"The origins and meaning of liberal/conservative self-identifications.\" ''American Journal of Political Science'' 25#4 (1981), pp. 617-645 617-645.</ref>\n\n[[Conservative Democrat]]s were outraged and led by [[Al Smith]] they formed the [[American Liberty League]] in 1934 and counterattacked. They failed and either retired from politics or joined the Republican Party. A few of them, such as [[Dean Acheson]], found their way back to the Democratic Party.<ref>Burns, ''Roosevelt: The Lion and the Fox'' (1958) pp 227-46.</ref>\n\nThe 1933 programs, called \"the First New Deal\" by historians, represented a broad consensus. Roosevelt tried to reach out to business and labor, farmers and consumers, cities and countryside. However, by 1934 he was moving toward a more confrontational policy. After making gains in state governorships and in Congress, in 1934 Roosevelt embarked on an ambitious legislative program that came to be called \"The [[Second New Deal]]\". It was characterized by building up labor unions, nationalizing welfare by the [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]], setting up [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]], imposing more regulations on business (especially transportation and communications) and raising taxes on business profits.<ref>James MacGregor Burns, ''Roosevelt: The Lion and the Fox: Vol. 1, 1882-1940'' (1958) pp 171-208.</ref>\n\nRoosevelt's New Deal programs focused on job creation through [[public works]] projects as well as on social welfare programs such as Social Security. It also included sweeping reforms to the banking system, work regulation, transportation, communications and stock markets, as well as attempts to regulate prices. His policies soon paid off by uniting a diverse coalition of Democratic voters called the [[New Deal coalition]], which included labor unions, Southerners, minorities (most significantly, Catholics and Jews) and [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberals]]. This united voter base allowed Democrats to be elected to Congress and the presidency for much of the next 30 years.<ref>Burns, ''Roosevelt: The Lion and the Fox'' (1958) pp 264-90.</ref>\n\n===The Second term===\nAfter a triumphant re-election in [[1936 United States presidential election|1936]], he announced plans to [[Judicial Procedures Reform Bill of 1937|enlarge the Supreme Court]], which tended to oppose his New Deal, by five new members. A firestorm of opposition erupted, led by his own Vice President [[John Nance Garner]]. Roosevelt was defeated by an alliance of Republicans and conservative Democrats, who formed a [[conservative coalition]] that managed to block nearly all liberal legislation (only a [[Minimum wage in the United States|minimum wage law]] got through). Annoyed by the conservative wing of his own party, Roosevelt made an attempt to rid himself of it and in 1938 he actively campaigned against five incumbent conservative Democratic senators, though all five senators won re-election.<ref>Milton Plesur,  \"The Republican congressional comeback of 1938.\" ''Review of Politics'' 24.4 (1962): 525-562.</ref>\n\n===The Party===\nUnder Roosevelt, the Democratic Party became identified more closely with modern liberalism, which included the promotion of [[social welfare]], [[labor unions]], [[civil rights]] and the regulation of business, as well as support for farmers and promotion of ethnic leaders. The opponents, who stressed long-term growth and support for entrepreneurship and low taxes, now started calling themselves \"conservatives\".<ref>Sean J. Savage, ''Roosevelt: The Party Leader, 1932-1945'' (2015).</ref>\n\n===World War II===\nWith a near disaster in 1937 with the so-called \"recession\" and the near defeat in Congress in 1938, things looked bleak for the Democrats, but FDR decided that he with the upcoming crisis that would become World War II, he was irreplaceable, and he broke tradition and ran for a third, and later 4th term, taking a Democratic congress with him.\n\n=== Presidency of Harry S. Truman (1945\u20131953) ===\n[[Harry S. Truman]] took over after Roosevelt's death in 1945 and the rifts inside the party that Roosevelt had papered over began to emerge. Major components included the big city machines, the Southern state and local parties, the far-left and the \"Liberal coalition\" or \"Liberal-Labor coalition\" comprising the [[American Federation of Labor|AFL]], [[Congress of Industrial Organizations|CIO]] and ideological groups such as the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People|NAACP]] (representing [[African American|Blacks]]), the [[American Jewish Congress]] (AJC) and the [[Americans for Democratic Action]] (ADA) (representing liberal intellectuals).<ref>\nDaniel Disalvo. \"The Politics of a Party Faction: The Liberal-Labor Alliance in the Democratic Party, 1948\u20131972,\" ''Journal of Policy History'' (2010) vol.  22#3 pp. 269\u201399 in [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/journal_of_policy_history/v022/22.3.disalvo.html Project MUSE]</ref> By 1948, the unions had expelled nearly all the far-left and communist elements.<ref>Max M.

Wallace]] denounced Truman as a war-monger for his anti-Soviet programs, the [[Truman Doctrine]], [[Marshall Plan]] and [[NATO]]. Wallace quit the party and ran for [[1948 United States presidential election|President as an independent in 1948]]. He called for [[d\u00e9tente]] with the [[Soviet Union\u2013United States relations|Soviet Union]], but much of his campaign was controlled by communists who had been expelled from the main unions.

Wallace supporters and other Democrats who were farther left were pushed out of the party and the CIO in 1946\u20131948 by young anti-communists like [[Hubert Humphrey]], [[Walter Reuther]] and [[Arthur Schlesinger Jr.]] [[Hollywood]] emerged in the 1940s as an important new base in the party and was led by movie-star politicians such as [[Ronald Reagan]], who strongly supported Roosevelt and Truman at this time.<ref>{{cite book|first=Edward M.|last=Yager|title=Ronald Reagan's Journey: Democrat to Republican|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U2cs7IHERBwC&pg=PA43|year=2006|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|page=43|isbn=9780742544215}}</ref>\n\nIn foreign policy, Europe was safe, but troubles mounted in Asia as China fell to the communists in 1949. Truman entered the [[Korean War]] without formal Congressional approval. When the war turned to a stalemate and he fired General [[Douglas MacArthur]] in 1951, Republicans blasted his policies in Asia. A series of petty scandals among friends and buddies of Truman further tarnished his image, allowing the Republicans in 1952 to crusade against \"Korea, Communism and Corruption\". Truman dropped out of the Presidential race early in 1952, leaving no obvious successor. The convention nominated [[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai Stevenson]] in [[1952 United States presidential election|1952]] and [[1956 United States presidential election|1956]], only to see him overwhelmed by two Eisenhower landslides.<ref>{{cite book|first=Kenneth F.|last=Warren|title=Encyclopedia of U.S. Campaigns, Elections, and Electoral Behavior|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lCh1AwAAQBAJ&pg=PA634|year=2008|publisher=SAGE Publications|page=634|isbn=9781452265872}}</ref>\n\n== Presidency of Dwight D.

It also brought brief Republican control to both houses of Congress for one term. In Congress, the powerful team of Texans House Speaker [[Sam Rayburn]] and Senate Majority leader [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] held the party together, often by compromising with Eisenhower. In 1958, the party made dramatic gains in the midterms and seemed to have a permanent lock on Congress, thanks largely to organized labor. Indeed, Democrats had majorities in the House every election from 1930 to 1992 (except 1946 and 1952).<ref>{{cite book|first1=Earl|last1=Black|first2=Merle|last2=Black|title=Divided America: The Ferocious Power Struggle in American Politics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tm8eHHDR_osC&pg=PT23|year=2007|publisher=Simon and Schuster|pages=23 |isbn=9781416539056}}</ref>\n\nMost Southern Congressmen were [[conservative Democrats]] and they usually worked with conservative Republicans.<ref>James T.

He challenged America in the [[Space Race]] to land an American man on the moon by 1969. After the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] he moved to de-escalate tensions with the [[Soviet Union]].<ref>James N. Giglio, ''Presidency of John F.

His election did mark the coming of age of the Catholic component of the New Deal Coalition. After 1964, middle class Catholics started voting Republican in the same proportion as their Protestant neighbors. Except for the Chicago of [[Richard J.

In January, even though it was a military defeat for the [[Viet Cong]], the [[Tet Offensive]] began to turn American public opinion against the Vietnam War. Senator [[Eugene McCarthy]] rallied intellectuals and [[Anti-war movement|anti-war]] students on college campuses and came within a few percentage points of defeating Johnson in the [[New Hampshire primary]]:Johnson was permanently weakened.

Kennedy won the critical California primary on June 4, but [[Assassination of Robert F. Kennedy|he was assassinated]] that night.

Nixon barely won, with the Democrats retaining control of Congress.

His only experience with federal politics was when he chaired the Democratic National Committee's congressional and gubernatorial elections in 1974. Some of Carter's major accomplishments consisted of the creation of a national energy policy and the consolidation of governmental agencies, resulting in two new cabinet departments, the [[United States Department of Energy]] and the [[United States Department of Education]]. Carter also successfully deregulated the trucking, airline, rail, finance, communications and oil industries (thus backtracking on the New Deal approach to regulation of the economy), bolstered the [[social security]] system and appointed record numbers of women and minorities to significant government and judicial posts. He also enacted strong legislation on environmental protection through the expansion of the [[National Park Service]] in [[Alaska]], creating 103 million acres (417,000&nbsp;km\u00b2) of park land.<ref>Gary M. Fink, and Hugh Davis Graham, eds. ''The Carter presidency: Policy choices in the post-New Deal era'' (University Press of Kansas, 1998).</ref>\n\nIn foreign affairs, Carter's accomplishments consisted of the [[Camp David Accords]], the [[Panama Canal Treaties]], the establishment of [[China\u2013United States relations|full diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China]] and the negotiation of the [[SALT II]] Treaty. In addition, he championed [[human rights]] throughout the world and used human rights as the center of his administration's foreign policy.<ref name=\"John Dumbrell 1995\">John Dumbrell, ''The Carter presidency: A re-evaluation'' (Manchester University Press, 1995)</ref>\n\nEven with all of these successes, Carter failed to implement a national health plan or to reform the tax system as he had promised in his campaign and inflation was also on the rise. Abroad, the [[Iranian hostage crisis|Iranians held 52 Americans hostage for 444 days]] and Carter's diplomatic and military rescue attempts failed. The [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]] later that year further disenchanted some Americans with Carter. In [[1980 United States presidential election|1980]], Carter defeated Senator [[Ted Kennedy]] to gain renomination, but lost to [[Ronald Reagan]] in November. The Democrats lost 12 Senate seats and for the first time since 1954 the Republicans controlled the Senate, though the House remained in Democratic hands.<ref name=\"John Dumbrell 1995\"/> After his defeat, Carter negotiated the release of every American hostage held in Iran and they were lifted out of Iran minutes after Reagan was inaugurated, ending a 444-day crisis.<ref>David Farber, ''Taken Hostage: The Iran Hostage Crisis and America's First Encounter with Radical Islam'' (2005)</ref>\n\n== Presidency of Ronald Reagan (1981\u20131989) ==\n=== 1980s: Battling Reaganism ===\n[[File:SpeakerO'Neill.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Representative [[Tip O'Neill|Thomas \"Tip\" O'Neill]] was Speaker of the House (1977\u20131987) and was the highest ranking Democrat in Washington, D.C. during most of Reagan's term]]\nDemocrats who supported many conservative policies were instrumental in the election of Republican [[Ronald Reagan|President Ronald Reagan]] in [[1980 United States presidential election|1980]]. The \"[[Reagan Democrat]]s\" were Democrats before the Reagan years and afterward, but they voted for Ronald Reagan in 1980 and [[1984 United States presidential election|1984]] and for [[George H. W. Bush]] in [[1988 United States presidential election|1988]], producing their landslide victories. Reagan Democrats were mostly white ethnics in the Northeast and Midwest who were attracted to Reagan's [[social conservatism]] on issues such as abortion and to his strong foreign policy. They did not continue to vote Republican in [[1992 United States presidential election|1992]] or [[1996 United States presidential election|1996]], so the term fell into disuse except as a reference to the 1980s. The term is not used to describe [[White Southerners]] who became permanent Republicans in presidential elections.<ref name=\"Stanley B. Greenberg 1996\">Stanley B. Greenberg, ''Middle Class Dreams: Politics and Power of the New American Majority'' (1996).</ref>\n\n[[Stan Greenberg]], a Democratic pollster, analyzed white ethnic voters \u2013 largely unionized auto workers \u2013 in suburban [[Macomb County, Michigan]], just north of Detroit. The county voted 63 percent for Kennedy in 1960 and 66 percent for Reagan in 1984. He concluded that Reagan Democrats no longer saw Democrats as champions of their middle class aspirations, but instead saw it as a party working primarily for the benefit of others, especially African Americans, [[advocacy group]]s of the [[political left]] and the very poor.<ref name=\"Stanley B. Greenberg 1996\"/>\n\nThe failure to hold the Reagan Democrats and the white South led to the final collapse of the New Deal coalition. In [[1984 United States presidential election|1984]], Reagan carried 49 states against former Vice President and Minnesota Senator [[Walter Mondale]], a New Deal stalwart.<ref>Steven M. Gillon, ''The Democrats' Dilemma: Walter F. Mondale and the Liberal Legacy'' (1992) pp. 365\u201390</ref>\n\nIn response to these landslide defeats, the [[Democratic Leadership Council]] (DLC) was created in 1985. It worked to move the party rightwards to the ideological center in order to recover some of the fundraising that had been lost to the Republicans due to corporate donors supporting Reagan. The goal was to retain left-of-center voters as well as moderates and conservatives on social issues to become a [[Big tent|catch all party]] with widespread appeal to most opponents of the Republicans. Despite this, Massachusetts Governor [[Michael Dukakis]], running not as a New Dealer but as an efficiency expert in public administration, lost by a landslide in [[1988 United States presidential election|1988]] to Vice President [[George H. W. Bush]].<ref>Jack W. Germond and Jules Witcover. ''Whose Broad Stripes and Bright Stars?'' (1989)</ref>\n\n=== South becomes Republican ===\nFor nearly a century after [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]], the white South identified with the Democratic Party. The Democrats' lock on power was so strong the region was called the [[Solid South]], although the Republicans controlled parts of the [[Appalachian mountains]] and they competed for statewide office in the [[Border states (American Civil War)|border states]]. Before 1948, [[Southern Democrats]] believed that their party, with its respect for [[states' rights]] and appreciation of traditional southern values, was the defender of the Southern way of life. Southern Democrats warned against aggressive designs on the part of Northern liberals and Republicans and civil rights activists whom they denounced as \"outside agitators\".<ref>Joseph A. Aistrup, ''The southern strategy revisited: Republican top-down advancement in the South'' (2015).</ref>\n\nThe adoption of the strong civil rights plank by the 1948 convention and the integration of the armed forces by President [[Harry S. Truman]]'s [[Executive Order 9981]], which provided for equal treatment and opportunity for African-American servicemen, drove a wedge between the Northern and Southern branches of the party. The party was sharply divided in the [[1948 United States presidential election|following election]], as [[Southern Democrats]] [[Strom Thurmond]] ran as \"States' Rights Democratic Party\".\n\nWith the presidency of John F. Kennedy the Democratic Party began to embrace the [[Civil Rights Movement]] and its lock on the South was irretrievably broken. Upon signing the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], President Lyndon B. Johnson prophesied: \"We have lost the South for a generation\".<ref>{{cite news|last=Risen|first=Clay|title=How the South was won|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=March 5, 2006|url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/ideas/articles/2006/03/05/how_the_south_was_won/|accessdate=November 24, 2006}}</ref>\n\nModernization had brought factories, national businesses and larger, more cosmopolitan cities such as [[Atlanta]], [[Dallas]], [[Charlotte]] and [[Houston]] to the South, as well as millions of migrants from the North and more opportunities for higher education. Meanwhile, the cotton and tobacco economy of the traditional rural South faded away, as former farmers commuted to factory jobs. As the South became more like the rest of the nation, it could not stand apart in terms of racial segregation. Integration and the Civil Rights Movement caused enormous controversy in the white South, with many attacking it as a violation of states' rights. When segregation was outlawed by court order and by the Civil Rights Acts of 1964 and 1965, a die-hard element resisted integration, led by Democratic governors [[Orval Faubus]] of Arkansas, [[Lester Maddox]] of Georgia and especially [[George Wallace]] of Alabama. These populist governors appealed to a less-educated, blue-collar electorate that on economic grounds favored the Democratic Party and opposed desegregation. After 1965, most Southerners accepted integration (with the exception of public schools).<ref>Jon P, Alston, and Ben M. Crouch. \"White acceptance of three degrees of school desegregation, 1974.\" ''Phylon'' 39.3 (1978): 216-224.</ref>\n\nBelieving themselves betrayed by the Democratic Party, traditional [[White Southerners]] joined the new middle-class and the Northern transplants in moving toward the Republican Party. Meanwhile, newly enfranchised black voters began supporting Democratic candidates at the 80\u201390 percent levels, producing Democratic leaders such as [[Julian Bond]] and [[John Lewis (Georgia politician)|John Lewis]] of Georgia and [[Barbara Jordan]] of Texas. Just as [[Martin Luther King]] had promised, integration had brought about a new day in Southern politics.<ref>Katherine Tate, ''Black faces in the mirror: African Americans and their representatives in the US Congress'' (2018).</ref>\n \nIn addition to its white middle-class base, Republicans attracted strong majorities among [[Evangelicalism|evangelical Christians]], who prior to the 1980s were largely apolitical. Exit polls in the [[2004 United States presidential election|2004 presidential election]] showed that [[George W. Bush]] led [[John Kerry]] by 70\u201330% among White Southerners, who were 71% of the voters. Kerry had a 90\u20139 lead among the 18% of Southern voters who were black. One-third of the Southern voters said they were white Evangelicals and they voted for Bush by 80\u201320.<ref>{{cite news|title=Exit Polls|publisher=CNN|url=http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2004/pages/results/states/US/P/00/epolls.3.html|date=November 2, 2004|accessdate=November 18, 2006}}</ref>\n\n== Presidency of George H.

Berman, ''America's Right Turn: From Nixon to Clinton'' (1998).</ref> In [[1992 United States presidential election|1992]], for the first time in 12 years the United States had a Democrat in the White House. During President [[Bill Clinton]]'s term, the Congress balanced the federal [[budget]] for the first time since the Kennedy Presidency and presided over a robust American economy that saw incomes grow across the board. In 1994, the economy had the lowest combination of unemployment and inflation in 25 years. President Clinton also signed into law several [[gun control]] bills, including the [[Brady Bill]], which imposed a five-day waiting period on handgun purchases; and he also signed into legislation a [[Federal Assault Weapons Ban|ban]] on many types of [[semi-automatic firearm]]s (which expired in 2004). His [[Family and Medical Leave Act]], covering some 40 million Americans, offered workers up to 12 weeks of unpaid, job-guaranteed leave for childbirth or a personal or family illness. He deployed the U.S. military to [[Haiti]] to reinstate deposed president [[Jean-Bertrand Aristide]], took a strong hand in [[Israeli\u2013Palestinian peace process|Palestinian-Israeli peace negotiations]], brokered a historic cease-fire in [[Northern Ireland]] and negotiated the [[Dayton accords]]. In [[1996 United States presidential election|1996]], Clinton became the first Democratic President to be re-elected since [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]].\n\nHowever, the Democrats lost their majority in both Houses of Congress in 1994. Clinton vetoed two Republican-backed [[welfare reform]] bills before signing the third, the [[Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act]] of 1996. The [[tort reform]] [[Private Securities Litigation Reform Act]] passed over his veto. Labor unions, which had been steadily losing membership since the 1960s, found they had also lost political clout inside the Democratic Party and Clinton enacted the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] with [[Canada]] and [[Mexico]] over unions' strong objections.<ref>{{cite news|last=Kilborn|first=Peter T.|title=The Free Trade Accord: Labor, Unions Vow to Punish Pact's Backers|work=The New York Times|date=November 19, 1993|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/19/us/the-free-trade-accord-labor-unions-vow-to-punish-pact-s-backers.html|accessdate=November 17, 2006}}</ref> In 1998, the Republican-led House of Representatives [[Impeachment of Bill Clinton|impeached]] Clinton on two charges, though he was subsequently acquitted by the [[United States Senate]] in 1999.

Even though analysis of roll call votes show that since the 1970s, Republicans have drifted farther to the right than Democrats have moved to the left, the latter were instrumental in implementing financial deregulation in the 1990s and focused increasingly on cultural issues such as gender, race, and sexual identity rather than traditional social welfare policies.<ref>{{cite book|last=Scheidel|first=Walter|author-link=Walter Scheidel|title=The Great Leveler: Violence and the History of Inequality from the Stone Age to the Twenty-First Century|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=|year=2017|isbn=978-0691165028|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=NgZpDQAAQBAJ&lpg=PP1&pg=PA416#v=onepage&q&f=false 416]|url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/10921.html}}</ref>\n\nBoth Carter and Clinton quietly abandoned the New Deal style of aggressive support for welfare for the poor and support for the working-class and labor unions. They downplayed traditional Democratic hostility toward business, and aggressive regulation of the economy. Carter and Clinton agreed on a greater reliance on the market economy\u2014As conservatives have long demanded. They gave control of inflation priority over reduction in unemployment. They both sought balanced budgets\u2014and Clinton actually succeeded in generating a federal budget surplus. They both used monetary policy more than fiscal/spending policy to micromanage the economy, and they accepted the conservative emphasis on supply-side programs to encourage private investment, and the expectation it would produce long-term economic growth.<ref>Iwan Morgan, \"Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton, and the new democratic economics.\" ''Historical Journal'' 47.4 (2004): 1015-1039.</ref>\n\n=== Election of 2000 ===\n{{main|United States presidential election, 2000}}\nDuring the [[2000 United States presidential election|2000 presidential election]], the Democrats chose Vice President [[Al Gore]] to be the party's candidate for the presidency. Gore ran against [[George W. Bush]], the Republican candidate and son of former President [[George H. W. Bush]]. The issues Gore championed include [[national debt|debt reduction]], tax cuts, foreign policy, public education, [[global warming]], judicial appointments and [[Affirmative action in the United States|affirmative action]]. Nevertheless, Gore's affiliation with Clinton and the DLC caused critics to assert that Bush and Gore were too similar, especially on free trade, reductions in social welfare and the death penalty. [[Green Party (United States)|Green Party]] presidential candidate [[Ralph Nader]] in particular was very vocal in his criticisms.\n\nGore won a popular plurality of over 540,000 votes over Bush, but lost in the [[United States Electoral College|Electoral College]] by four votes. Many Democrats blamed Nader's third-party [[spoiler effect|spoiler role]] for Gore's defeat. They pointed to the states of New Hampshire (4 electoral votes) and Florida (25 electoral votes), where Nader's total votes exceeded Bush's margin of victory. In Florida, Nader received 97,000 votes and Bush defeated Gore by a mere 537. Controversy plagued the election and Gore largely dropped from elective politics.\n\nDespite Gore's close defeat, the Democrats gained five seats in the Senate (including the election of [[Hillary Clinton]] in New York) to turn a 55\u201345 Republican edge into a 50\u201350 split (with a Republican Vice President breaking a tie). However, when Republican Senator [[Jim Jeffords]] of Vermont decided in 2001 to become an independent and vote with the Democratic caucus, the majority status shifted along with the seat, including control of the floor (by the Majority Leader) and control of all committee chairmanships. However, the Republicans regained their Senate majority with gains in 2002 and 2004, leaving the Democrats with only 44 seats, the fewest since the 1920s.<ref>{{cite book|author=CQ Press|title=Guide to Congress|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iqN2AwAAQBAJ&pg=PA156|year=2012|publisher=SAGE Publications|page=156}}</ref>\n\n== Presidency of George W.

With job losses and bankruptcies across regions and industries increasing in 2001 and 2002, the Democrats generally campaigned on the issue of economic recovery. That did not work for them in 2002, as the Democrats lost a few seats in the U.S. House of Representatives. They lost three seats in the Senate ([[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] as [[Max Cleland]] was unseated, [[Minnesota]] as Paul Wellstone died and [[Walter Mondale|his succeeding Democratic candidate]] lost the election and [[Missouri]] as [[Jean Carnahan]] was unseated).

Despite a weak economic recovery and high unemployment, the Obama campaign successfully mobilized its coalition of youth, blacks, Hispanics and women. The campaign carried all the same states as in 2008 except two, Indiana and North Carolina. The election continued the pattern whereby Democrats won more votes in all presidential elections after 1988, except for 2004.

During the [[Second Party System]] (from 1832 to the mid-1850s) under [[President of the United States|Presidents]] [[Andrew Jackson]], [[Martin Van Buren]] and [[James K. Polk]], the Democrats usually bested the opposition [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] by narrow margins.\n\nFrom 1860 to 1932 in the era of the [[American Civil War]] to the [[Great Depression]], the opposing [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republican Party]], organized in the mid-1850s from the ruins of the Whig Party and some other smaller splinter groups, was dominant in [[United States presidential election|presidential politics]]. The Democrats elected [[List of United States Presidents|only two Presidents]] during this period: [[Grover Cleveland]] (in 1884 and 1892) and [[Woodrow Wilson]] (in 1912 and 1916). Over the same period, the Democrats proved more competitive with the Republicans in [[United States midterm election|Congressional politics]], enjoying [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] majorities (as in the [[65th United States Congress|65th Congress]]) in 15 of the 36 [[United States Congress|Congresses]] elected, although only in five of these did they form the majority in the [[United States Senate|Senate]]. Furthermore, the Democratic Party was split between the [[Bourbon Democrat]]s, representing Eastern business interests; and the agrarian elements comprising poor farmers in the South and West. The agrarian element, marching behind the slogan of [[free silver]] (i.e. in favor of inflation), captured the party in 1896 and nominated [[William Jennings Bryan]] in the 1896, 1900 and 1908 presidential elections, although he lost every time. Both Bryan and Wilson were leaders of the [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive movement in the United States]] (1890s\u20131920s).\n\n[[File:Andrew jackson head.jpg|upright=0.9|thumb|[[Andrew Jackson]], founder of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and the first [[President of the United States|President]] to be elected from the Democratic Party (1829\u20131837)]]\nStarting with 32nd President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] in 1932 during the Great Depression, the party dominated the [[Fifth Party System]], with its [[Social liberalism|progressive liberal]] policies and programs with the [[New Deal coalition]] to combat the emergency bank closings and the continuing financial depression since the famous [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]] and later going into the crises leading up to [[World War II]]. The Democrats and the Democratic Party finally lost the [[White House]] and control of the executive branch of government only after Roosevelt's death in April 1945 near the end of the war and after the continuing post-war administration of Roosevelt's third [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Harry S. Truman]], former [[United States Senator|Senator]] from Missouri (for 1945 to 1953, elections of [[1944 United States presidential election|1944]] and the \"stunner\" of [[1948 United States presidential election|1948]]). A new [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] President was only elected later in the following decade of the early 1950s with the losses by two-time nominee, the [[Governor of Illinois]] [[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai Stevenson]] (grandson of the [[Adlai Stevenson I|former Vice President with the same name]] of the [[1892 United States presidential election|1890s]]) to the very popular war hero and commanding general in World War II, [[General of the Army (United States)|General]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] (in [[1952 United States presidential election|1952]] and [[1956 United States presidential election|1956]]).\n\nWith two brief interruptions since the Great Depression and World War II eras, the Democrats with unusually large majorities for over four decades, controlled the lower house of the Congress in the House of Representatives from 1930 until 1994 and the Senate for most of that same period, electing the [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] and the Representatives' majority leaders/committee chairs along with the upper house of the Senate's majority leaders and committee chairmen. Important Democratic progressive/liberal leaders included 33rd and 36th Presidents Harry S. Truman of [[Missouri]] (1945\u20131953) and [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] of [[Texas]] (1963\u20131969), respectively; and the earlier [[Kennedy family|Kennedy brothers]] of 35th President [[John F. Kennedy]] of [[Massachusetts]] (1961\u20131963), Senators [[Robert F. Kennedy]] of [[New York State|New York]] and Senator [[Ted Kennedy]] of Massachusetts who carried the flag for [[Modern liberalism in the United States|modern American liberalism]]. Since the [[1976 United States presidential election|presidential election of 1976]], Democrats have won five out of the last eleven presidential elections, winning in the presidential elections of [[1976 United States presidential election|1976]] (with 39th President [[Jimmy Carter]] of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], 1977\u20131981), [[1992 United States presidential election|1992]] and [[1996 United States presidential election|1996]] (with 42nd President [[Bill Clinton]] of [[Arkansas]], 1993\u20132001) and [[2008 United States presidential election|2008]] and [[2012 United States presidential election|2012]] (with 44th President [[Barack Obama]] of [[Illinois]], 2009\u20132017). Democrats have also won the [[Plurality voting|popular vote]] in [[2000 United States presidential election|2000]] and [[2016 United States presidential election|2016]], but lost the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] with [[Al Gore]] and [[Hillary Clinton]], respectively.

Social scientists Theodore Caplow et al. argue that \"the Democratic party, nationally, moved from left-center toward the center in the 1940s and 1950s, then moved further toward the right-center in the 1970s and 1980s\".<ref>{{cite book|first1=Theodore|last1=Caplow|first2=Howard M.|last2=Bahr|first3=Bruce A.|last3=Chadwick|first4=John|last4=Modell|title=Recent Social Trends in the United States, 1960\u20131990|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gwBvm8aF2bsC&pg=PA337|year=1994|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press|page=337|isbn=9780773512122}} They add: \"The Republican party, nationally, moved from right-center toward the center in 1940s and 1950s, then moved right again in the 1970s and 1980s.</ref>\n\n== Foundation: 1820-28 ==\nThe modern Democratic Party emerged in the late 1820s from former factions of the [[Democratic-Republican Party]], which had largely collapsed by 1824. It was built by [[Martin Van Buren]], who assembled a cadre of politicians in every state behind war hero [[Andrew Jackson]] of Tennessee.<ref>Robert V. Remini, ''Martin Van Buren and the Making of the Democratic Party'' (1959).</ref>\n\n==Jacksonian ascendancy: 1829-40==\n\n=== Presidency of Andrew Jackson (1829\u20131837) ===\n\n{{main|Jacksonian democracy}}\n[[File:The modern balaam and his ass.jpg|thumb|upright=1.05|1837 cartoon shows the Democratic Party as donkey]]\n\nThe spirit of [[Jacksonian democracy]] animated the party from the early 1830s to the 1850s, shaping the [[Second Party System]], with the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] as the main opposition. After the disappearance of the [[Federalist party|Federalists]] after 1815 and the [[Era of Good Feelings]] (1816\u20131824), there was a hiatus of weakly organized personal factions until about 1828\u20131832, when the modern Democratic Party emerged along with its rival, the Whigs. The new Democratic Party became a coalition of farmers, city-dwelling laborers and Irish Catholics.<ref>Sean Wilentz, ''The Rise of American Democracy: Jefferson to Lincoln'' (2005)</ref> Both parties worked hard to build [[grassroots]] organizations and maximize the turnout of voters, which often reached 80 percent or 90 percent of eligible voters. Both parties used [[Patronage#Politics|patronage]] extensively to finance their operations, which included emerging big city [[political machine]]s as well as national networks of newspapers.<ref>Michael Kazin, ed., ''The Concise Princeton Encyclopedia of American Political History'' (2011) pp 59-65, 159-62, 600-603.</ref>\n\nBehind the party platforms, acceptance speeches of candidates, editorials, pamphlets and stump speeches, there was a widespread consensus of political values among Democrats. As Mary Beth Norton explains: <blockquote>The Democrats represented a wide range of views but shared a fundamental commitment to the [[Jeffersonian democracy|Jeffersonian]] concept of an [[agrarian society]]. They viewed the central government as the enemy of individual liberty. The 1824 \"[[Corrupt Bargain|corrupt bargain]]\" had strengthened their suspicion of Washington politics. [...] Jacksonians feared the concentration of economic and political power. They believed that government intervention in the economy benefited special-interest groups and created corporate monopolies that favored the rich. They sought to restore the independence of the individual \u2013 the artisan and the ordinary farmer \u2013 by ending federal support of banks and corporations and restricting the use of [[Banknote|paper currency]], which they distrusted. Their definition of the proper role of government tended to be negative, and Jackson's political power was largely expressed in negative acts. He exercised the veto more than all previous presidents combined. Jackson and his supporters also opposed reform as a movement. Reformers eager to turn their programs into legislation called for a more active government. But Democrats tended to oppose programs like [[Education reform|educational reform]] and the establishment of a public education system....Nor did Jackson share reformers' humanitarian concerns. He had no sympathy for [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]], initiating the removal of the [[Cherokee]]s along the [[Trail of Tears]].<ref>Mary Beth Norton et al., ''A People and a Nation, Volume I: to 1877'' (Houghton Mifflin, 2007) p. 287</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe party was weakest in [[New England]], but strong everywhere else and won most national elections thanks to strength in [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[Virginia]] (by far the most populous states at the time) and the [[American frontier]]. Democrats opposed elites and aristocrats, the [[Second Bank of the United States|Bank of the United States]] and the whiggish modernizing programs that would build up industry at the expense of the [[yeoman]] or independent small farmer.<ref>John Ashworth, ''\"Agrarians\" & \"Aristocrats\": Party Political Ideology in the United States, 1837\u20131846'' (1983).</ref>\n\nThe party was known for its populism.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://utpress.org/title/andrew-jackson-and-the-rise-of-the-democratic-party/|title=Andrew Jackson and the Rise of the Democratic Party - University of Tennessee Press|publisher=}}</ref> Historian Frank Towers has specified an important ideological divide: <blockquote>Democrats stood for the 'sovereignty of the people' as expressed in popular demonstrations, constitutional conventions, and majority rule as a general principle of governing, whereas Whigs advocated the rule of law, written and unchanging constitutions, and protections for minority interests against majority tyranny.<ref>Frank Towers, \"Mobtown's Impact on the Study of Urban Politics in the Early Republic.\" ''Maryland Historical Magazine'' 107 (Winter 2012) pp. 469\u201375, p. 472, citing Robert E, Shalhope, ''The Baltimore Bank Riot: Political Upheaval in Antebellum Maryland'' (2009) p. 147.</ref></blockquote>\n\nAt its inception, the Democratic Party was the party of the \"common man\".<ref name=\"auto1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.chronicle.com/blognetwork/edgeofthewest/2013/04/10/wait-whose-plantation-now/|title=Wait, Whose Plantation Now? - The Edge of the American West|first=David|last=Silbey|website=The Chronicle of Higher Education}}</ref> It opposed the abolition of slavery.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/2014/12/8/7328755/maps-democratic-party|title=23 maps that explain how Democrats went from the party of racism to the party of Obama|first=Andrew|last=Prokop|date=8 December 2014|website=Vox}}</ref><ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nFrom 1828 to 1848, banking and tariffs were the central domestic policy issues. Democrats strongly favored\u2014and Whigs opposed\u2014expansion to new farm lands, as typified by their expulsion of eastern [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]] and acquisition of vast amounts of new land in the West after 1846. The party favored the [[Mexican\u2013American War|war with Mexico]] and opposed anti-immigrant [[nativism (politics)|nativism]]. In the 1830s, the [[Locofocos]] in New York City were radically democratic, anti-monopoly and were proponents of [[Hard money (policy)|hard money]] and [[free trade]].<ref>Earle (2004), p. 19</ref><ref>Taylor (2006), p. 54</ref> Their chief spokesman was [[William Leggett (USA)|William Leggett]]. At this time, [[labor union]]s were few and some were loosely affiliated with the party.<ref>Sean Wilentz, ''Chants Democratic: New York City and the Rise of the American Working Class, 1788\u20131850'' (1984)</ref>\n\n=== Presidency of Martin Van Buren (1837\u20131841) ===\n[[Martin Van Buren]] was key in the development of the Democratic Party, although his presidency featured many setbacks. Many of the policies of Jackson had repercussions while Van Buren held office, such as the [[Trail of Tears]]. The policies enacted during Jackson came into full swing during Van Buren, who oversaw the displacement of thousands of Native Americans. In addition to this, Van Buren was anti-slavery and represented a divide in both parties. Despite this, he did almost nothing to help the abolitionist movement and his presidency saw a continuation of pro-slavery legislation. Jackson's decision to abolish the [[Second Bank of the United States]] led to the [[Panic of 1837]] during Van Buren's presidency, leading to disapproval by the public and loss of power for his party.\n\nThe 1840 Democratic convention was the first at which the party adopted a platform. Delegates reaffirmed their belief that the Constitution was the primary guide for each state's political affairs. To them, this meant that all roles of the federal government not specifically defined fell to each respective state government, including such responsibilities as debt created by local projects. Decentralized power and states' rights pervaded each and every resolution adopted at the convention, including those on slavery, taxes, and the possibility of a central bank.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/main/polcon/democraticindex.html |title= 1840 Democratic Convention |publisher=[[Library of Congress]] |accessdate=February 27, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite conference |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015030799376 |title=Proceedings of the National democratic convention, held in ...

The Whigs nominated [[William Henry Harrison]] as their candidate for the 1840 presidential race. Harrison won as the first President of the Whigs. However, he died in office a month later and was succeeded by his Vice President [[John Tyler]]. Tyler had recently left the Democrats for the Whigs and thus his beliefs did not align much with the Whig Party. During his presidency, he vetoed many of his own party's bills, leading to his own party disowning him. This allowed for the Democrats to retake power in 1845.\n\n== Presidency of James K. Polk (1845\u20131849) ==\nForeign policy was a major issue in the 1840s as war threatened with Mexico over Texas and with Britain over Oregon. Democrats strongly supported [[Manifest Destiny]] and most Whigs strongly opposed it. The [[1844 United States presidential election|1844 election]] was a showdown, with the Democrat [[James K. Polk]] narrowly defeating Whig [[Henry Clay]] on the Texas issue.<ref>Daniel Walker Howe, ''What Hath God Wrought: The Transformation of America 1815\u20131848'' (2007) pp. 705\u2013706.</ref>\n\n[[John Mack Faragher]]'s analysis of the political polarization between the parties is: <blockquote>Most Democrats were wholehearted supporters of expansion, whereas many Whigs (especially in the [[Northern United States|North]]) were opposed. Whigs welcomed most of the changes wrought by [[Technological and industrial history of the United States|industrialization]] but advocated strong government policies that would guide growth and development within the country's existing boundaries; they feared (correctly) that expansion raised a contentious issue the extension of slavery to the [[Organized incorporated territories of the United States|territories]]. On the other hand, many Democrats feared industrialization the Whigs welcomed. [...] For many Democrats, the answer to the nation's social ills was to continue to follow [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s vision of establishing agriculture in the new territories in order to counterbalance industrialization.<ref>John Mack Faragher et al. ''Out of Many: A History of the American People'' (2nd ed. 1997) p. 413</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Free Soil split===\nIn [[1848 United States presidential election|1848]] a major innovation was the creation of the [[Democratic National Committee]] (DNC) to coordinate state activities in the presidential contest. Senator [[Lewis Cass]], who held many offices over the years, lost to General [[Zachary Taylor]] of the Whigs. A major cause of the defeat was that the new [[Free Soil Party]], which opposed slavery expansion, split the Democratic vote, particularly in New York, where the electoral votes went to Taylor.<ref>Frederick J. Blue, ''The Free Soilers: Third Party Politics, 1848-54'' (1973).</ref> The Free Soil Party attracted Democrats, and some Whigs, and had considerable support in the Northeast. The primary doctrine was a warning that rich slave owners would move into new territories such as Nebraska and buy up the best lands, and work them with slaves. To protect the white farmer it was essential therefore to keep the soil \"free\"\u2014that is without slavery. The fate of the slaves was not of concern. In 1852, the free soil movement was much smaller, and consisted primarily of former members of the Liberty Party and some abolitionists, it hedged on the question of full equality. The majority wanted some form of racial separation to allow space for black activism, without alienating the overwhelming northern opposition to equal rights for black men.<ref>Eric  Foner,  \"Politics and Prejudice: The Free Soil Party and the Negro, 1849-1852.\" ''Journal of Negro History'' 50.4 (1965): 239-256. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2716247 online]</ref>\n\n== Presidencies of Zachary Taylor (1849\u20131850) and Millard Fillmore (1850\u20131853) ==\nFollowing the death of President Taylor, Democrats in Congress passed the [[Compromise of 1850]] designed to avoid civil war by putting the slavery issue to rest while resolves issued involving territories gained following the War with Mexico. However, in state after state the Democrats gained small but permanent advantages over the Whig Party, which finally collapsed in 1852, fatally weakened by division on slavery and [[Nativism (politics)|nativism]]. The fragmented opposition could not stop the election of Democrats [[Franklin Pierce]] in [[1852 United States presidential election|1852]] and [[James Buchanan]] in [[1856 United States presidential election|1856]].<ref>Wilentz, ''The Rise of American Democracy: Jefferson to Lincoln'' (2005) ch. 21\u201322.</ref>\n\n== The presidencies of Franklin Pierce (1853\u201357) and James Buchanan (1857\u201361) ==\n[[file:Augustbelmont.jpg|thumb|upright=.90|August Belmont: DNC Chair for 12 years during and after the Civil war]]\n\nThe eight years during which Franklin Pierce and James Buchanan held the presidency were disasters; historians agree that they rank as among the worst presidents. The Party increasingly split along regional lines. In 1860 two Democrats ran for president and the United States was moving rapidly toward civil war.<ref>David M. Potter, ''The Impending Crisis, 1848\u20131861'' (1976) pp 225-67.</ref>\n\n=== Young America ===\nYonatan Eyal (2007) argues that the 1840s and 1850s were the heyday of a new faction of young Democrats called \"[[Young America movement|Young America]]\". Led by [[Stephen A. Douglas]], James K. Polk, Franklin Pierce and New York financier [[August Belmont]], this faction explains, broke with the agrarian and [[Strict constructionism|strict constructionist]] orthodoxies of the past and embraced commerce, technology, regulation, reform and internationalism. The movement attracted a circle of outstanding writers, including [[William Cullen Bryant]], [[George Bancroft]], [[Herman Melville]] and [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]]. They sought independence from European standards of [[high culture]] and wanted to demonstrate the excellence and [[exceptionalism]] of [[American literature|America's own literary tradition]].<ref>Yonatan Eyal, ''The Young America Movement and the Transformation of the Democratic Party, 1828\u20131861'', (2007)</ref>\n\nIn economic policy, Young America saw the necessity of a modern infrastructure with railroads, canals, telegraphs, turnpikes and harbors. They endorsed the \"[[market revolution]]\" and promoted [[capitalism]]. They called for Congressional land grants to the states, which allowed Democrats to claim that [[internal improvements]] were locally rather than federally sponsored. Young America claimed that modernization would perpetuate the agrarian vision of [[Jeffersonian democracy]] by allowing yeomen farmers to sell their products and therefore to prosper.

The conflict was papered over at the [[1852 Democratic National Convention|1852]] and [[1856 Democratic National Convention|1856 conventions]] by selecting men who had little involvement in sectionalism, but they made matters worse. Historian [[Roy F. Nichols]] explains why [[Franklin Pierce]] was not up to the challenges a Democratic president had to face:\n:As a national political leader Pierce was an accident. He was honest and tenacious of his views but, as he made up his mind with difficulty and often reversed himself before making a final decision, he gave a general impression of instability. Kind, courteous, generous, he attracted many individuals, but his attempts to satisfy all factions failed and made him many enemies. In carrying out his principles of strict construction he was most in accord with Southerners, who generally had the [[Letter and spirit of the law|letter of the law]] on their side. He failed utterly to realize the depth and the sincerity of Northern feeling against the South and was bewildered at the general flouting of the law and the Constitution, as he described it, by the people of his own New England. At no time did he catch the popular imagination. His inability to cope with the difficult problems that arose early in his administration caused him to lose the respect of great numbers, especially in the North, and his few successes failed to restore public confidence. He was an inexperienced man, suddenly called to assume a tremendous responsibility, who honestly tried to do his best without adequate training or temperamental fitness.<ref>Roy F.

The demands were to support slavery outside the South. Southerners insisted that full equality for their region required the government to acknowledge the legitimacy of slavery outside the South. The Southern demands included a fugitive slave law to recapture runaway slaves; opening Kansas to slavery; forcing a pro-slavery constitution on Kansas; acquire Cuba (where slavery already existed); accepting the Dred Scott decision of the Supreme Court; and adopting a federal slave code to protect slavery in the territories. President Buchanan went along with these demands, but Douglas refused and proved a much better politician than Buchanan, though the bitter battle lasted for years and permanently alienated the Northern and Southern wings.<ref>Michael Todd Landis.

No party politics were allowed in the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]], whose political leadership, mindful of the welter prevalent in antebellum American politics and with a pressing need for unity, largely viewed political parties as inimical to good governance and as being especially unwise in wartime.

To a considerable extent, the challenge of restoring morale was the province of historian [[Claude Bowers]]. His histories of the Democratic Party in its formative years from the 1790s to the 1830s helped shape the party's self-image as a powerful force against monopoly and privilege. In his enormously popular books ''Party Battles of the Jackson Period'' (1922) and ''Jefferson and Hamilton: The Struggle for Democracy in America'' (1925) he argued for the political and moral superiority of the Democratic Party since the days of Jefferson versus the almost un-American faults of the [[Federalist Party]], the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]], and the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], as bastions of aristocracy. ''Jefferson and Hamilton'' especially impressed his friend [[Franklin D Roosevelt]]. It inspired Roosevelt when he became president to build a great monument to the party's founder in the national capital, the [[Jefferson Memorial]]. According to Historian [[Merrill D. Peterson]], the book conveyed:\n<blockquote>the myth of the Democratic Party masterfully re-created, a fresh awareness of the elemental differences between the parties, and ideology with which they might make sense of the two often senseless conflicts of the present, and a feeling for the importance of dynamic leadership. The book was a mirror for Democrats.<ref>{{cite book|first=Merrill D.|last=Peterson|title=The Jefferson Image in the American Mind|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0QNrZoAgGAsC&pg=PA351|year=1960|page=351|isbn=9780813918518}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n== The Great Depression and a Second World War: Democratic hegemony (1930\u201353) ==\nThe Great Depression marred Hoover's term as the Democratic Party made large gains in the 1930 congressional elections and garnered a landslide win in 1932.\n\n=== Presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt (1933\u20131945) ===\n[[File:FDR in 1933.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], the longest-serving President of the United States (1933\u20131945)]]\nThe [[Wall Street Crash 1929|stock market crash of 1929]] and the ensuing [[Great Depression]] set the stage for a more progressive government and [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] won a [[landslide victory]] in the [[1932 United States presidential election|election of 1932]], campaigning on a platform of \"Relief, Recovery, and Reform\", that is relief of unemployment and rural distress, recovery of the economy back to normal and long-term structural reforms to prevent a repetition of the Depression. This came to be termed \"[[New Deal|The New Deal]]\" after a phrase in Roosevelt's acceptance speech.<ref>Robert T. Oliver, \"The speech that established Roosevelt's reputation.\" ''Quarterly Journal of Speech '' 31#3   (1945): 274-282.</ref>\n\nThe Democrats also swept to large majorities in both houses of Congress and among state governors. Roosevelt altered the nature of the party, away from ''laissez-faire'' capitalism and towards an ideology of economic regulation and insurance against hardship. Two old words took on new meanings: \"liberal\" now meant a supporter of the New Deal while \"conservative\" meant an opponent.<ref>[[Pamela Johnston Conover]], and Stanley Feldman, \"The origins and meaning of liberal/conservative self-identifications.\" ''American Journal of Political Science'' 25#4 (1981), pp. 617-645 617-645.</ref>\n\n[[Conservative Democrat]]s were outraged and led by [[Al Smith]] they formed the [[American Liberty League]] in 1934 and counterattacked. They failed and either retired from politics or joined the Republican Party. A few of them, such as [[Dean Acheson]], found their way back to the Democratic Party.<ref>Burns, ''Roosevelt: The Lion and the Fox'' (1958) pp 227-46.</ref>\n\nThe 1933 programs, called \"the First New Deal\" by historians, represented a broad consensus. Roosevelt tried to reach out to business and labor, farmers and consumers, cities and countryside. However, by 1934 he was moving toward a more confrontational policy. After making gains in state governorships and in Congress, in 1934 Roosevelt embarked on an ambitious legislative program that came to be called \"The [[Second New Deal]]\". It was characterized by building up labor unions, nationalizing welfare by the [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]], setting up [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]], imposing more regulations on business (especially transportation and communications) and raising taxes on business profits.<ref>James MacGregor Burns, ''Roosevelt: The Lion and the Fox: Vol. 1, 1882-1940'' (1958) pp 171-208.</ref>\n\nRoosevelt's New Deal programs focused on job creation through [[public works]] projects as well as on social welfare programs such as Social Security. It also included sweeping reforms to the banking system, work regulation, transportation, communications and stock markets, as well as attempts to regulate prices. His policies soon paid off by uniting a diverse coalition of Democratic voters called the [[New Deal coalition]], which included labor unions, Southerners, minorities (most significantly, Catholics and Jews) and [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberals]]. This united voter base allowed Democrats to be elected to Congress and the presidency for much of the next 30 years.<ref>Burns, ''Roosevelt: The Lion and the Fox'' (1958) pp 264-90.</ref>\n\n===The Second term===\nAfter a triumphant re-election in [[1936 United States presidential election|1936]], he announced plans to [[Judicial Procedures Reform Bill of 1937|enlarge the Supreme Court]], which tended to oppose his New Deal, by five new members. A firestorm of opposition erupted, led by his own Vice President [[John Nance Garner]]. Roosevelt was defeated by an alliance of Republicans and conservative Democrats, who formed a [[conservative coalition]] that managed to block nearly all liberal legislation (only a [[Minimum wage in the United States|minimum wage law]] got through). Annoyed by the conservative wing of his own party, Roosevelt made an attempt to rid himself of it and in 1938 he actively campaigned against five incumbent conservative Democratic senators, though all five senators won re-election.<ref>Milton Plesur,  \"The Republican congressional comeback of 1938.\" ''Review of Politics'' 24.4 (1962): 525-562.</ref>\n\n===The Party===\nUnder Roosevelt, the Democratic Party became identified more closely with modern liberalism, which included the promotion of [[social welfare]], [[labor unions]], [[civil rights]] and the regulation of business, as well as support for farmers and promotion of ethnic leaders. The opponents, who stressed long-term growth and support for entrepreneurship and low taxes, now started calling themselves \"conservatives\".<ref>Sean J. Savage, ''Roosevelt: The Party Leader, 1932-1945'' (2015).</ref>\n\n===World War II===\nWith a near disaster in 1937 with the so-called \"recession\" and the near defeat in Congress in 1938, things looked bleak for the Democrats, but FDR decided that he with the upcoming crisis that would become World War II, he was irreplaceable, and he broke tradition and ran for a third, and later 4th term, taking a Democratic congress with him.\n\n=== Presidency of Harry S. Truman (1945\u20131953) ===\n[[Harry S. Truman]] took over after Roosevelt's death in 1945 and the rifts inside the party that Roosevelt had papered over began to emerge. Major components included the big city machines, the Southern state and local parties, the far-left and the \"Liberal coalition\" or \"Liberal-Labor coalition\" comprising the [[American Federation of Labor|AFL]], [[Congress of Industrial Organizations|CIO]] and ideological groups such as the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People|NAACP]] (representing [[African American|Blacks]]), the [[American Jewish Congress]] (AJC) and the [[Americans for Democratic Action]] (ADA) (representing liberal intellectuals).<ref>\nDaniel Disalvo. \"The Politics of a Party Faction: The Liberal-Labor Alliance in the Democratic Party, 1948\u20131972,\" ''Journal of Policy History'' (2010) vol.  22#3 pp. 269\u201399 in [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/journal_of_policy_history/v022/22.3.disalvo.html Project MUSE]</ref> By 1948, the unions had expelled nearly all the far-left and communist elements.<ref>Max M.

However, all of Truman's [[Fair Deal]] proposals, such as [[universal health care]], were defeated by the Southern Democrats in Congress.

Savage, ''Truman and the Democratic Party'' (2015).</ref>\n\n==== Foreign policy ====\nOn the far-left, former Vice President [[Henry A. Wallace]] denounced Truman as a war-monger for his anti-Soviet programs, the [[Truman Doctrine]], [[Marshall Plan]] and [[NATO]]. Wallace quit the party and ran for [[1948 United States presidential election|President as an independent in 1948]]. He called for [[d\u00e9tente]] with the [[Soviet Union\u2013United States relations|Soviet Union]], but much of his campaign was controlled by communists who had been expelled from the main unions. Wallace fared poorly and helped turn the anti-communist vote toward Truman.<ref>Robert A.

Wallace supporters and other Democrats who were farther left were pushed out of the party and the CIO in 1946\u20131948 by young anti-communists like [[Hubert Humphrey]], [[Walter Reuther]] and [[Arthur Schlesinger Jr.]] [[Hollywood]] emerged in the 1940s as an important new base in the party and was led by movie-star politicians such as [[Ronald Reagan]], who strongly supported Roosevelt and Truman at this time.<ref>{{cite book|first=Edward M.|last=Yager|title=Ronald Reagan's Journey: Democrat to Republican|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U2cs7IHERBwC&pg=PA43|year=2006|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|page=43|isbn=9780742544215}}</ref>\n\nIn foreign policy, Europe was safe, but troubles mounted in Asia as China fell to the communists in 1949. Truman entered the [[Korean War]] without formal Congressional approval. When the war turned to a stalemate and he fired General [[Douglas MacArthur]] in 1951, Republicans blasted his policies in Asia. A series of petty scandals among friends and buddies of Truman further tarnished his image, allowing the Republicans in 1952 to crusade against \"Korea, Communism and Corruption\". Truman dropped out of the Presidential race early in 1952, leaving no obvious successor. The convention nominated [[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai Stevenson]] in [[1952 United States presidential election|1952]] and [[1956 United States presidential election|1956]], only to see him overwhelmed by two Eisenhower landslides.<ref>{{cite book|first=Kenneth F.|last=Warren|title=Encyclopedia of U.S. Campaigns, Elections, and Electoral Behavior|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lCh1AwAAQBAJ&pg=PA634|year=2008|publisher=SAGE Publications|page=634|isbn=9781452265872}}</ref>\n\n== Presidency of Dwight D.

It also brought brief Republican control to both houses of Congress for one term. In Congress, the powerful team of Texans House Speaker [[Sam Rayburn]] and Senate Majority leader [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] held the party together, often by compromising with Eisenhower. In 1958, the party made dramatic gains in the midterms and seemed to have a permanent lock on Congress, thanks largely to organized labor. Indeed, Democrats had majorities in the House every election from 1930 to 1992 (except 1946 and 1952).<ref>{{cite book|first1=Earl|last1=Black|first2=Merle|last2=Black|title=Divided America: The Ferocious Power Struggle in American Politics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tm8eHHDR_osC&pg=PT23|year=2007|publisher=Simon and Schuster|pages=23 |isbn=9781416539056}}</ref>\n\nMost Southern Congressmen were [[conservative Democrats]] and they usually worked with conservative Republicans.<ref>James T.

He challenged America in the [[Space Race]] to land an American man on the moon by 1969. After the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] he moved to de-escalate tensions with the [[Soviet Union]].<ref>James N. Giglio, ''Presidency of John F. Kennedy'' (2006).</ref>\n\nKennedy also pushed for [[civil rights]] and [[racial integration]], one example being Kennedy assigning federal marshals to protect the [[Freedom Riders]] in the South. His election did mark the coming of age of the Catholic component of the New Deal Coalition. After 1964, middle class Catholics started voting Republican in the same proportion as their Protestant neighbors. Except for the Chicago of [[Richard J.

Many Democrats and Republicans from the South opposed the act. The year 1968 marked a major crisis for the party. In January, even though it was a military defeat for the [[Viet Cong]], the [[Tet Offensive]] began to turn American public opinion against the Vietnam War. Senator [[Eugene McCarthy]] rallied intellectuals and [[Anti-war movement|anti-war]] students on college campuses and came within a few percentage points of defeating Johnson in the [[New Hampshire primary]]:Johnson was permanently weakened.

Kennedy won the critical California primary on June 4, but [[Assassination of Robert F. Kennedy|he was assassinated]] that night.

Meanwhile, Alabama's Democratic governor [[George C. Wallace]] launched a third-party campaign and at one point was running second to the Republican candidate Richard Nixon. Nixon barely won, with the Democrats retaining control of Congress.

Carter also successfully deregulated the trucking, airline, rail, finance, communications and oil industries (thus backtracking on the New Deal approach to regulation of the economy), bolstered the [[social security]] system and appointed record numbers of women and minorities to significant government and judicial posts.

Abroad, the [[Iranian hostage crisis|Iranians held 52 Americans hostage for 444 days]] and Carter's diplomatic and military rescue attempts failed. The [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]] later that year further disenchanted some Americans with Carter. In [[1980 United States presidential election|1980]], Carter defeated Senator [[Ted Kennedy]] to gain renomination, but lost to [[Ronald Reagan]] in November. The Democrats lost 12 Senate seats and for the first time since 1954 the Republicans controlled the Senate, though the House remained in Democratic hands.<ref name=\"John Dumbrell 1995\"/> After his defeat, Carter negotiated the release of every American hostage held in Iran and they were lifted out of Iran minutes after Reagan was inaugurated, ending a 444-day crisis.<ref>David Farber, ''Taken Hostage: The Iran Hostage Crisis and America's First Encounter with Radical Islam'' (2005)</ref>\n\n== Presidency of Ronald Reagan (1981\u20131989) ==\n=== 1980s: Battling Reaganism ===\n[[File:SpeakerO'Neill.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Representative [[Tip O'Neill|Thomas \"Tip\" O'Neill]] was Speaker of the House (1977\u20131987) and was the highest ranking Democrat in Washington, D.C. during most of Reagan's term]]\nDemocrats who supported many conservative policies were instrumental in the election of Republican [[Ronald Reagan|President Ronald Reagan]] in [[1980 United States presidential election|1980]]. The \"[[Reagan Democrat]]s\" were Democrats before the Reagan years and afterward, but they voted for Ronald Reagan in 1980 and [[1984 United States presidential election|1984]] and for [[George H. W. Bush]] in [[1988 United States presidential election|1988]], producing their landslide victories. Reagan Democrats were mostly white ethnics in the Northeast and Midwest who were attracted to Reagan's [[social conservatism]] on issues such as abortion and to his strong foreign policy. They did not continue to vote Republican in [[1992 United States presidential election|1992]] or [[1996 United States presidential election|1996]], so the term fell into disuse except as a reference to the 1980s. The term is not used to describe [[White Southerners]] who became permanent Republicans in presidential elections.<ref name=\"Stanley B. Greenberg 1996\">Stanley B. Greenberg, ''Middle Class Dreams: Politics and Power of the New American Majority'' (1996).</ref>\n\n[[Stan Greenberg]], a Democratic pollster, analyzed white ethnic voters \u2013 largely unionized auto workers \u2013 in suburban [[Macomb County, Michigan]], just north of Detroit. The county voted 63 percent for Kennedy in 1960 and 66 percent for Reagan in 1984. He concluded that Reagan Democrats no longer saw Democrats as champions of their middle class aspirations, but instead saw it as a party working primarily for the benefit of others, especially African Americans, [[advocacy group]]s of the [[political left]] and the very poor.<ref name=\"Stanley B. Greenberg 1996\"/>\n\nThe failure to hold the Reagan Democrats and the white South led to the final collapse of the New Deal coalition. In [[1984 United States presidential election|1984]], Reagan carried 49 states against former Vice President and Minnesota Senator [[Walter Mondale]], a New Deal stalwart.<ref>Steven M. Gillon, ''The Democrats' Dilemma: Walter F. Mondale and the Liberal Legacy'' (1992) pp. 365\u201390</ref>\n\nIn response to these landslide defeats, the [[Democratic Leadership Council]] (DLC) was created in 1985. It worked to move the party rightwards to the ideological center in order to recover some of the fundraising that had been lost to the Republicans due to corporate donors supporting Reagan. The goal was to retain left-of-center voters as well as moderates and conservatives on social issues to become a [[Big tent|catch all party]] with widespread appeal to most opponents of the Republicans. Despite this, Massachusetts Governor [[Michael Dukakis]], running not as a New Dealer but as an efficiency expert in public administration, lost by a landslide in [[1988 United States presidential election|1988]] to Vice President [[George H. W. Bush]].<ref>Jack W. Germond and Jules Witcover. ''Whose Broad Stripes and Bright Stars?'' (1989)</ref>\n\n=== South becomes Republican ===\nFor nearly a century after [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]], the white South identified with the Democratic Party. The Democrats' lock on power was so strong the region was called the [[Solid South]], although the Republicans controlled parts of the [[Appalachian mountains]] and they competed for statewide office in the [[Border states (American Civil War)|border states]]. Before 1948, [[Southern Democrats]] believed that their party, with its respect for [[states' rights]] and appreciation of traditional southern values, was the defender of the Southern way of life. Southern Democrats warned against aggressive designs on the part of Northern liberals and Republicans and civil rights activists whom they denounced as \"outside agitators\".<ref>Joseph A. Aistrup, ''The southern strategy revisited: Republican top-down advancement in the South'' (2015).</ref>\n\nThe adoption of the strong civil rights plank by the 1948 convention and the integration of the armed forces by President [[Harry S. Truman]]'s [[Executive Order 9981]], which provided for equal treatment and opportunity for African-American servicemen, drove a wedge between the Northern and Southern branches of the party. The party was sharply divided in the [[1948 United States presidential election|following election]], as [[Southern Democrats]] [[Strom Thurmond]] ran as \"States' Rights Democratic Party\".\n\nWith the presidency of John F. Kennedy the Democratic Party began to embrace the [[Civil Rights Movement]] and its lock on the South was irretrievably broken. Upon signing the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], President Lyndon B. Johnson prophesied: \"We have lost the South for a generation\".<ref>{{cite news|last=Risen|first=Clay|title=How the South was won|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=March 5, 2006|url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/ideas/articles/2006/03/05/how_the_south_was_won/|accessdate=November 24, 2006}}</ref>\n\nModernization had brought factories, national businesses and larger, more cosmopolitan cities such as [[Atlanta]], [[Dallas]], [[Charlotte]] and [[Houston]] to the South, as well as millions of migrants from the North and more opportunities for higher education. Meanwhile, the cotton and tobacco economy of the traditional rural South faded away, as former farmers commuted to factory jobs. As the South became more like the rest of the nation, it could not stand apart in terms of racial segregation. Integration and the Civil Rights Movement caused enormous controversy in the white South, with many attacking it as a violation of states' rights. When segregation was outlawed by court order and by the Civil Rights Acts of 1964 and 1965, a die-hard element resisted integration, led by Democratic governors [[Orval Faubus]] of Arkansas, [[Lester Maddox]] of Georgia and especially [[George Wallace]] of Alabama. These populist governors appealed to a less-educated, blue-collar electorate that on economic grounds favored the Democratic Party and opposed desegregation. After 1965, most Southerners accepted integration (with the exception of public schools).<ref>Jon P, Alston, and Ben M. Crouch. \"White acceptance of three degrees of school desegregation, 1974.\" ''Phylon'' 39.3 (1978): 216-224.</ref>\n\nBelieving themselves betrayed by the Democratic Party, traditional [[White Southerners]] joined the new middle-class and the Northern transplants in moving toward the Republican Party. Meanwhile, newly enfranchised black voters began supporting Democratic candidates at the 80\u201390 percent levels, producing Democratic leaders such as [[Julian Bond]] and [[John Lewis (Georgia politician)|John Lewis]] of Georgia and [[Barbara Jordan]] of Texas. Just as [[Martin Luther King]] had promised, integration had brought about a new day in Southern politics.<ref>Katherine Tate, ''Black faces in the mirror: African Americans and their representatives in the US Congress'' (2018).</ref>\n \nIn addition to its white middle-class base, Republicans attracted strong majorities among [[Evangelicalism|evangelical Christians]], who prior to the 1980s were largely apolitical. Exit polls in the [[2004 United States presidential election|2004 presidential election]] showed that [[George W. Bush]] led [[John Kerry]] by 70\u201330% among White Southerners, who were 71% of the voters. Kerry had a 90\u20139 lead among the 18% of Southern voters who were black. One-third of the Southern voters said they were white Evangelicals and they voted for Bush by 80\u201320.<ref>{{cite news|title=Exit Polls|publisher=CNN|url=http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2004/pages/results/states/US/P/00/epolls.3.html|date=November 2, 2004|accessdate=November 18, 2006}}</ref>\n\n== Presidency of George H.

Congress on January 12, 1991 authorized by a narrow margin the use of military force against Iraq, with Republicans in favor and Democrats opposed.

Berman, ''America's Right Turn: From Nixon to Clinton'' (1998).</ref> In [[1992 United States presidential election|1992]], for the first time in 12 years the United States had a Democrat in the White House. During President [[Bill Clinton]]'s term, the Congress balanced the federal [[budget]] for the first time since the Kennedy Presidency and presided over a robust American economy that saw incomes grow across the board. In 1994, the economy had the lowest combination of unemployment and inflation in 25 years. President Clinton also signed into law several [[gun control]] bills, including the [[Brady Bill]], which imposed a five-day waiting period on handgun purchases; and he also signed into legislation a [[Federal Assault Weapons Ban|ban]] on many types of [[semi-automatic firearm]]s (which expired in 2004). His [[Family and Medical Leave Act]], covering some 40 million Americans, offered workers up to 12 weeks of unpaid, job-guaranteed leave for childbirth or a personal or family illness. He deployed the U.S. military to [[Haiti]] to reinstate deposed president [[Jean-Bertrand Aristide]], took a strong hand in [[Israeli\u2013Palestinian peace process|Palestinian-Israeli peace negotiations]], brokered a historic cease-fire in [[Northern Ireland]] and negotiated the [[Dayton accords]]. In [[1996 United States presidential election|1996]], Clinton became the first Democratic President to be re-elected since [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]].\n\nHowever, the Democrats lost their majority in both Houses of Congress in 1994. Clinton vetoed two Republican-backed [[welfare reform]] bills before signing the third, the [[Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act]] of 1996. The [[tort reform]] [[Private Securities Litigation Reform Act]] passed over his veto. Labor unions, which had been steadily losing membership since the 1960s, found they had also lost political clout inside the Democratic Party and Clinton enacted the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] with [[Canada]] and [[Mexico]] over unions' strong objections.<ref>{{cite news|last=Kilborn|first=Peter T.|title=The Free Trade Accord: Labor, Unions Vow to Punish Pact's Backers|work=The New York Times|date=November 19, 1993|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/19/us/the-free-trade-accord-labor-unions-vow-to-punish-pact-s-backers.html|accessdate=November 17, 2006}}</ref> In 1998, the Republican-led House of Representatives [[Impeachment of Bill Clinton|impeached]] Clinton on two charges, though he was subsequently acquitted by the [[United States Senate]] in 1999.

Bill Clinton presided over the growth of the loosely supervised shadow financial system and the repeal of Depression-era restrictions on commercial banks.<ref>Sebastian Mallaby.

Even though analysis of roll call votes show that since the 1970s, Republicans have drifted farther to the right than Democrats have moved to the left, the latter were instrumental in implementing financial deregulation in the 1990s and focused increasingly on cultural issues such as gender, race, and sexual identity rather than traditional social welfare policies.<ref>{{cite book|last=Scheidel|first=Walter|author-link=Walter Scheidel|title=The Great Leveler: Violence and the History of Inequality from the Stone Age to the Twenty-First Century|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=|year=2017|isbn=978-0691165028|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=NgZpDQAAQBAJ&lpg=PP1&pg=PA416#v=onepage&q&f=false 416]|url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/10921.html}}</ref>\n\nBoth Carter and Clinton quietly abandoned the New Deal style of aggressive support for welfare for the poor and support for the working-class and labor unions. They downplayed traditional Democratic hostility toward business, and aggressive regulation of the economy. Carter and Clinton agreed on a greater reliance on the market economy\u2014As conservatives have long demanded. They gave control of inflation priority over reduction in unemployment. They both sought balanced budgets\u2014and Clinton actually succeeded in generating a federal budget surplus. They both used monetary policy more than fiscal/spending policy to micromanage the economy, and they accepted the conservative emphasis on supply-side programs to encourage private investment, and the expectation it would produce long-term economic growth.<ref>Iwan Morgan, \"Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton, and the new democratic economics.\" ''Historical Journal'' 47.4 (2004): 1015-1039.</ref>\n\n=== Election of 2000 ===\n{{main|United States presidential election, 2000}}\nDuring the [[2000 United States presidential election|2000 presidential election]], the Democrats chose Vice President [[Al Gore]] to be the party's candidate for the presidency. Gore ran against [[George W. Bush]], the Republican candidate and son of former President [[George H. W. Bush]]. The issues Gore championed include [[national debt|debt reduction]], tax cuts, foreign policy, public education, [[global warming]], judicial appointments and [[Affirmative action in the United States|affirmative action]]. Nevertheless, Gore's affiliation with Clinton and the DLC caused critics to assert that Bush and Gore were too similar, especially on free trade, reductions in social welfare and the death penalty. [[Green Party (United States)|Green Party]] presidential candidate [[Ralph Nader]] in particular was very vocal in his criticisms.\n\nGore won a popular plurality of over 540,000 votes over Bush, but lost in the [[United States Electoral College|Electoral College]] by four votes. Many Democrats blamed Nader's third-party [[spoiler effect|spoiler role]] for Gore's defeat. They pointed to the states of New Hampshire (4 electoral votes) and Florida (25 electoral votes), where Nader's total votes exceeded Bush's margin of victory. In Florida, Nader received 97,000 votes and Bush defeated Gore by a mere 537. Controversy plagued the election and Gore largely dropped from elective politics.\n\nDespite Gore's close defeat, the Democrats gained five seats in the Senate (including the election of [[Hillary Clinton]] in New York) to turn a 55\u201345 Republican edge into a 50\u201350 split (with a Republican Vice President breaking a tie). However, when Republican Senator [[Jim Jeffords]] of Vermont decided in 2001 to become an independent and vote with the Democratic caucus, the majority status shifted along with the seat, including control of the floor (by the Majority Leader) and control of all committee chairmanships. However, the Republicans regained their Senate majority with gains in 2002 and 2004, leaving the Democrats with only 44 seats, the fewest since the 1920s.<ref>{{cite book|author=CQ Press|title=Guide to Congress|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iqN2AwAAQBAJ&pg=PA156|year=2012|publisher=SAGE Publications|page=156}}</ref>\n\n== Presidency of George W.

All but one Democrat (Representative [[Barbara Lee]]) voted with their Republican counterparts to authorize President Bush's [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|2001 invasion of Afghanistan]]. House leader [[Richard Gephardt]] and Senate leader [[Thomas Daschle]] pushed Democrats to vote for the [[Patriot Act|USA PATRIOT Act]] and the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion of Iraq]].

This led to the bipartisan [[Sarbanes-Oxley Act]] in 2002. With job losses and bankruptcies across regions and industries increasing in 2001 and 2002, the Democrats generally campaigned on the issue of economic recovery. That did not work for them in 2002, as the Democrats lost a few seats in the U.S. House of Representatives. They lost three seats in the Senate ([[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] as [[Max Cleland]] was unseated, [[Minnesota]] as Paul Wellstone died and [[Walter Mondale|his succeeding Democratic candidate]] lost the election and [[Missouri]] as [[Jean Carnahan]] was unseated). While Democrats gained governorships in [[New Mexico]] (where [[Bill Richardson]] was elected), [[Arizona]] ([[Janet Napolitano]]), [[Michigan]] ([[Jennifer Granholm]]) and [[Wyoming]] ([[Dave Freudenthal]]). Other Democrats lost governorships in [[South Carolina]] ([[Jim Hodges]]), [[Alabama]] ([[Don Siegelman]]) and\u2014for the first time in more than a century\u2014Georgia ([[Roy Barnes]]). The election led to another round of soul searching about the party's narrowing base.

An unusual gaffe known as the \"Dean Scream\" and subsequent negative media coverage doomed his candidacy. The nomination went to Massachusetts Senator [[John Kerry]], a centrist with heavy support from the [[Democratic Leadership Council]]. Democrats pulled together in attacking Bush's war in Iraq. Kerry lost by a 3 million vote margin out of 120 million votes and lost four Senate seats. The Democrats had only 44 Senators, their fewest since the 1920s.

The 26-year-old son of a blacksmith in [[Pordenone]] in Northeastern [[Italy]] began the business by making home stoves and wood-burning ovens.\n\nIn 1933 Antonio Zanussi launched REX, the company's newest trademark at that time, to coincide with a huge media event of the day: the new record for a transatlantic crossing (Gibraltar to New York) with which the [[SS Rex|Italian liner \u201cRex\u201d]] conquered the [[Blue Riband]].\n\nIn 1946 Antonio Zanussi died and management of the family business passed to his sons Lino and Guido. Under the leadership of Lino, the company developed into a modern industrial concern and in 1951, with a workforce of over 300, the company began to diversify into gas and electric, and combined gas/electric ovens; and, with growing availability and popularity of gas cylinders, Zanussi brought out their first gas cooker \u2013 the Rex 401.\n\nA factory was opened at Porcia in 1954 and a Study Centre was established to research and design new appliances.\n\n1958 saw the production of the first Zanussi washing machines. The same strategy underlay the creation, a year later, of the company\u2019s Design and research Centre.\n\nIn 1959 Zanussi launched the first \u201cSupermarket\u201d fridge with automatic defrosting and two compartments with separate temperature controls. At the end of the 1950s, Zanussi launched its \u201cTropic System\u201d featuring a rounded style. Meanwhile, the washing machines were already into the second generation, with front-loading, and five washing programmes, developed with an eye for the requirements of the important German market.\n\nIn 1960, Zanussi started producing TV sets. By 1962, Zanussi exported its products to 60 countries.\n\n1964 saw the first appearance in Italy of a fridge with a \u201312C compartment that was suitable for the conservation of frozen food \u2013 the \u201cFreezermarket\u201d Rex. In the following year, Zanussi put its first dishwasher on the market.\n\nThe next decade was one of important purchases, with the Becchi, Castor, [[Zoppas]] and Triplex brands all joining the Zanussi Group, and of the start-up of manufacturing outside Italy. Zanussi advanced to leadership of the Italian household appliance industry with a 25% market share, and was among the foremost producers in Europe with 10% of sales throughout the continent.\n\nIn late 1974, Zanussi released the [[Ping-O-Tronic]] under the [[S\u00e8leco]] brand.\n\nThe death of Lino Zanussi and his closest assistants in an airplane crash in Spain on 18 June 1968 marked a change of strategy. In the meantime the economic situation in Italy had changed and with plans for diversification undermined by the difficulties being experienced by Italian industry in general, Zanussi slipped towards financial crisis in the late 1970s and the first half of the 1980s. The recovery process began in 1985 after [[Electrolux]] acquired the company in late 1984.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ghoshal|first=Sumantra|last2=Haspeslagh|first2=Philippe|date=1990-12-01|title=The acquisition and integration of Zanussi by Electrolux : A case study|journal=European Management Journal|volume=8|issue=4|pages=414\u2013433|doi=10.1016/0263-2373(90)90102-C|issn=0263-2373}}</ref>\n\nIn 1985, Zanussi introduced the Jetsystem on their range of washing machines, which uses a circulation pump to pump the water in the drum onto the clothes via a jet hole in the door seal.

In his third speech on the war, Robespierre countered <!--on 25 January 1792--> in the Jacobin club, \"A revolutionary war must be waged to free subjects and slaves from unjust tyranny, not for the traditional reasons of defending dynasties and expanding frontiers...\" Indeed, argued Robespierre, such a war could only favour the forces of counter-revolution, since it would play into the hands of those who opposed the sovereignty of the people. The risks of [[Caesarism]] were clear, for, in wartime, the powers of the generals would grow at the expense of ordinary soldiers, and the power of the king and court at the expense of the Assembly. These dangers should not be overlooked, he reminded his listeners; \"...in troubled periods of history, generals often became the arbiters of the fate of their countries.\"{{sfn|Haydon|Doyle|2006|loc= in \"Robespierre, the war and its organization\" by Forrest, A}} <!--Robespierre spoke for many deputies when queried the wisdom of spreading France's commitments too widely, or of risking the uncertainties of foreign war when there were enemies to be rooted out at home.<ref>A.

This compulsion hardly belongs to the man who enunciates them; it belongs to universal reason and to all men who wish to listen to its voice. It belongs to my colleagues of the [[National Constituent Assembly (France)|Constituent Assembly]], to the patriots of the Legislative Assembly, to all citizens who will invariably defend the cause of liberty. Experience has proven, despite Louis XVI and his allies, that the opinion of the Jacobins and the popular clubs were those of the French Nation; no citizen has made them, and I did nothing other than share in them.{{sfn|Robespierre|1958|pp=83\u201384|loc= in Tome IX, Discours}} }}\n\nTurning the accusations upon his accusers, Robespierre delivered one of the most famous lines of the French Revolution to the Assembly:\n\n{{quote|I will not remind you that the sole object of contention dividing us is that you have instinctively defended all acts of new ministers, and we, of principles; that you seemed to prefer power, and we equality...

Most Montagnards favoured judgment and execution, while the Girondins were more divided concerning how to proceed, with some arguing for royal inviolability, others for clemency, and others advocating lesser punishment or banishment.{{sfn|Kennedy|1988|pp=308\u201310}} On 13 November Robespierre stated in the Convention that a Constitution which Louis had violated himself, and which declared his inviolability, could not now be used in his defence.{{sfn|Robespierre|1958|loc= in Tome IX, Discours|pp=104\u201305, [https://fr.wikisource.org/w/index.php?title=Page:\u0152uvres_compl\u00e8tes_de_Maximilien_de_Robespierre,_tome_9.djvu/122 120].}} Robespierre had been taken ill and had done little other than support [[Louis Antoine de Saint-Just|Saint-Just]], a former colonel in the National Guard, who gave his first major speech to address and argue against the king's inviolability.

Robespierre argued that the dethroned king could now function only as a threat to liberty and national peace and that the members of the Assembly were not to be impartial judges but rather statesmen with responsibility for ensuring public safety:\n\n{{quote|Louis was a king, and our republic is established; the critical question concerning you must be decided by these words alone. Louis was dethroned by his crimes; Louis denounced the French people as rebels; he appealed to chains, to the armies of tyrants who are his brothers; the victory of the people established that Louis alone was a rebel; Louis cannot, therefore, be judged; he already is judged. He is condemned, or the republic cannot be absolved. To propose to have a trial of Louis XVI, in whatever manner one may, is to retrogress to royal despotism and constitutionality; it is a counter-revolutionary idea because it places the revolution itself in litigation. In effect, if Louis may still be given a trial, he may be absolved, and innocent. What am I to say? He is presumed to be so until he is judged. But if Louis is absolved, if he may be presumed innocent, what becomes of the revolution? If Louis is innocent, all the defenders of liberty become slanderers. <!--Our enemies have been friends of the people and of truth and defenders of innocence oppressed; all the declarations of foreign courts are nothing more than the legitimate claims against an illegal faction. Even the detention that Louis has endured is, then, an unjust vexation; the f\u00e9d\u00e9r\u00e9s, the people of Paris, all the patriots of the French Empire are guilty; and this great trial in the court of nature judging between crime and virtue, liberty and tyranny, is at last decided in favour of crime and tyranny. Citizens, take warning; you are being fooled by false notions; you confuse positive, civil rights with the principles of the rights of mankind; you confuse the relationships of citizens amongst themselves with the connections between nations and an enemy that conspires against it; you confuse the situation of a people in revolution with that of a people whose government is affirmed; you confuse a nation that punishes a public functionary to conserve its form of government, and one that destroys the government itself. We are falling back upon ideas familiar to us, in an extraordinary case that depends upon principles we have never yet applied.-->{{sfn|Robespierre|1958|pp=121\u201322|loc= in Tome IX, Discours}}}}\n\nIn arguing for a judgment by the elected Convention without trial, Robespierre supported the recommendations of [[Jean-Baptiste Mailhe]], who headed the commission reporting on legal aspects of Louis's trial or judgment. Unlike some Girondins, Robespierre specifically opposed judgment by primary assemblies or a referendum, believing that this could cause a civil war.{{sfn|Soboul|2005|p=867|loc= in \"Proc\u00e8s du Roi\" by Dorigny, M}} While he called for a trial of Queen Marie-Antoinette and the imprisonment of the Dauphin, Robespierre advocated that the king be executed despite his opposition to capital punishment:\n\n{{quote|<!--As for myself, I abhor the death penalty administered by your laws, and for Louis I have neither love, nor hate; I hate only his crimes. I have demanded the abolition of the death penalty at your Constituent Assembly, and am not to blame if the first principles of reason appeared to you moral and political heresies. But if you will never reclaim these principles in favour of so much evil, the crimes of which belong less to you and more to the government, by what fatal error would you remember yourselves and plead for the greatest of criminals? You ask an exception to the death penalty for him alone who could legitimise it? -->Yes, the death penalty is, in general, crime, unjustifiable by the indestructible principles of nature, except in cases protecting the safety of individuals or the society altogether. Ordinary misdemeanours have never threatened public safety because society may always protect itself by other means, making those culpable powerless to harm it. But for a king dethroned in the bosom of a revolution, which is as yet cemented only by laws; a king whose name attracts the scourge of war upon a troubled nation; neither prison nor exile can render his existence inconsequential to public happiness; this cruel exception to the ordinary laws avowed by justice can be imputed only to the nature of his crimes. With regret, I pronounce this fatal truth: Louis must die so that the nation may live.{{sfn|Robespierre|1958|pp=129\u201330|loc= in Tome IX, Discours}}}}\n\nOn 4 December the Convention decreed all the royalist writings illegal.<ref>William J.

On the day after the emancipation decree, Robespierre delivered a speech to the National Convention in which he praised the French as the first to \"summon all men to equality and liberty, and their full rights as citizens,\" using the word slavery twice but without specifically mentioning the French colonies.{{sfn|Popkin|2010|pp=350\u201370}} Despite petitions from the slaveholding delegation, Robespierre and the Committee decided to endorse the decree in full.{{sfn|Popkin|2010|pp=350\u201370}}\n\nSeveral weeks later, in a speech before the Committee of Public Safety, Robespierre linked the cruelty of slavery with serfdom:\n\n{{quote|Ask a merchant of human flesh what is property; he will answer by showing you that long coffin he calls a ship...

On 6 May 1794 Robespierre announced to the Convention that in the name of the French people, the Committee of Public Safety had decided to recognize the [[existence of God]] and the [[immortality]] of the human soul. Accordingly, on 7 May, Robespierre delivered a long presentation to the Convention \u2018on the relation of religious and moral ideas to republican principles, and on national festivals\u2019.<ref name=\"auto11\"/> Robespierre supported a decree that the Convention passed to establish an official state religion called the [[Cult of the Supreme Being]]. The notion of the Supreme Being was based on the creed of the Savoy chaplain that Jean-Jacques Rousseau had outlined in Book IV of ''[[Emile, or On Education|Emile]]''.\n\nIn the afternoon of 8 June (also the Christian holiday of [[Pentecost]]) a \"Festival of the Supreme Being\" was held. Everything was arranged to the exact specifications that had been drawn up previously set before the ceremony. The ominous and symbolic guillotine had been moved to the original standing place of the [[Bastille]]. Pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers with their babies were specifically invited to walk in the procession which started at the [[Tuileries]].{{sfn | Moore | 2007 | p=291}} ([[Joachim Vilate]] had invited Robespierre to have lunch in the Pavillon de Flore, but he ate little.)\n\nThe festival was also Robespierre's first appearance in the public eye as a leader for the people, and also as president of the Convention, to which he had been elected only four days earlier.{{sfn|Andress|2006|p=308}} Witnesses state that throughout the \"Festival of the Supreme Being\", Robespierre beamed with joy. He was able to speak of the things about which he was truly passionate, including virtue, nature, deist beliefs and his disagreements with atheism. He dressed elaborately, wearing feathers on his hat and holding fruit and flowers in his hands, and walked first in the festival procession. According to Michelet: \"Robespierre, as usual, walked quickly, with an agitated air. The Convention did not move nearly so fast. The leaders, perhaps maliciously and out of perfidious deference, remained well behind him, thereby isolating him.\"<ref>Michelet, J.

Robespierre delivered two speeches in which he emphasized his concept of a Supreme Being:\n\n<blockquote>Is it not He whose immortal hand, engraving on the heart of man the code of justice and equality, has written there the death sentence of tyrants? Is it not He who, from the beginning of time, decreed for all the ages and for all peoples liberty, good faith, and justice? He did not create kings to devour the human race. He did not create priests to harness us, like vile animals, to the chariots of kings and to give to the world examples of baseness, pride, perfidy, avarice, debauchery and falsehood. He created the universe to proclaim His power. He created men to help each other, to love each other mutually, and to attain to happiness by the way of virtue.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/mod/robespierre-supreme.asp|title=Robespierre, M. \"The Cult of the Supreme Being\", in Modern History Sourcebook, 1997|website=sourcebooks.fordham.edu}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nRobespierre came down the mountain in a way that resembled [[Moses]] as the leader of the people.

He disapproved of any acts which could be seen as exposing the nation to counter-revolutionaries and traitors and became increasingly fearful of the defeat of the Revolution.

There is also a [[Robespierre (Paris M\u00e9tro)|Metro station \u2018Robespierre\u2019]] on Line 9 (Mairie de Montreuil - Pont de S\u00e8vres), in the commune of Montreuil, named during the era of the [[Popular Front (France)|\nPopular Front]].\nThere are, however, numerous streets, roads and squares named for him elsewhere in France.<ref>See https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximilien_de_Robespierre#Voies_publiques</ref>\n\n==== Plaques and monuments ====\n===== Arras =====\n\n* On 14 Octobre 1923, a plaque was placed on the house at 9 Rue Maximilien Robespierre (formerly Rue des Rapporteurs) rented by the three Robespierre siblings in 1787-1789, in the presence of the mayor Gustave Lemelle, Albert Mathiez and Louis Jacob, president of the [[Rosati]]. Built in 1730, the house has had a varied history as a typing school, and a craftsmen\u2019s museum, but is now being developed as a Robespierre Museum.  \n* In 1994, a plaque was unveiled by ARBR on the fa\u00e7ade of the Carrauts\u2019 brewery on the Rue Ronville, where Maximilien and Augustin were brought up by their grandparents.\n* An [[Art Deco]] marble bust by Maurice Cladel was intended to be displayed in the gardens of the former [[Abbey of Saint-Vaast]]. A mixture of politics and concerns about weathering led to it being placed in the [[H\u00f4tel de Ville, Arras|H\u00f4tel de Ville]]. After many years in a tribunal room, it can now be seen in the Salle Robespierre. Bronze casts of the bust were made for the bicentenary and are displayed in his former home on Rue Maximilien Robespierre and at the Lyc\u00e9e Robespierre, unveiled in 1990.\n\n===== Paris and elsewhere =====\n* Robespierre is commemorated by two plaques in Paris, one on the exterior of the Duplays\u2019 house, now 398 [[rue Saint-Honor\u00e9]], the other, erected by the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des \u00e9tudes robespierristes in the [[Conciergerie]].\n* In 1909, a committee presided over by [[Ren\u00e9 Viviani]] and [[Georges Clemenceau]] proposed erecting a statue in the garden of the [[Tuileries]], but press hostility and failure to garner enough public subscriptions led to its abandonment. However, Robespierre is recognisable in [[Fran\u00e7ois-L\u00e9on Sicard]]\u2019s marble Altar of the [[National Convention]] (1913), originally intended for the gardens of the Tuileries and now in the [[Panth\u00e9on]]. \n* A stone bust by Albert S\u00e9raphin (1949) stands in the square Robespierre, opposite the theatre in [[Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis|Saint-Denis]], with the inscription: \u201cMaximilien Robespierre l'Incorruptible 1758-1794\u201d.<ref>See Ren\u00e9 & Peter van der Krogt, ''Statues \u2013 Hither & Thither'' for photographs: https://statues.vanderkrogt.net/object.php?webpage=ST&record=frif030</ref>\n* Charles Correia\u2019s 1980s bronze sculptural group at the Coll\u00e8ge Robespierre in [[\u00c9pinay-sur-Seine]] depicts him and [[Louis Antoine de Saint-Just]] at a table, working on the 1793 Constitution and Declaration of Human Rights.<ref>See ''Seine-Saint-D\u00e9nis Atlas de l\u2019architecture et du patrimoine''for photographs by Agn\u00e8s Paty: https://patrimoine.seinesaintdenis.fr/spip.php?page=document&id_document=1028036</ref>  A mural in the school also depicts him.<ref>See D\u00e9partement Seine-Saint-D\u00e9nis ''Atlas de l\u2019architecture et du patrimoine'': https://patrimoine.seinesaintdenis.fr/spip.php?page=document&id_document=1028019</ref>\n* In 1986, [[Claude-Andr\u00e9 Deseine]]\u2019s terracotta bust of 1791 was bought for the new [[Mus\u00e9e de la R\u00e9volution fran\u00e7aise]] at [[Vizille]]. This returned to public view Robespierre\u2019s only surviving contemporary sculpted portrait. A plaster cast of it is displayed at the Conciergerie in Paris, and a bronze cast is in the Place de la R\u00e9volution Fran\u00e7aise in [[Montpellier]], with bronzes of other figures of the time.<ref>See Nella Buscot, sculpteur, ''Sculptures \u00e0 Montpellier'': http://www.nella-buscot.com/jardins_montpellier_prf_2.php</ref>\n\n==== Resistance units ====\nIn the Second World War, several Resistance groups took his name: the Robespierre Company in [[Pau, Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques|Pau]], commanded by Lieutenant Aurin, alias Mar\u00e9chal; the Robespierre Batallion in the [[Rh\u00f4ne]], under Captain Laplace; and a [[Maquis (World War II)|maquis]] formed by Marcel Claeys in the [[Ain]].\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources (selection)==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Andress |first1=David |title=The Terror: The Merciless War for Freedom in Revolutionary France |date=2006 |publisher=Farrar, Straus, and Giroux |isbn=978-0374273415 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zDfxQDcQzJ0C |language=en |ref=harv}}\n* Aulard, Fran\u00e7ois-Alphonse (1897).

It belongs to my colleagues of the [[National Constituent Assembly (France)|Constituent Assembly]], to the patriots of the Legislative Assembly, to all citizens who will invariably defend the cause of liberty. Experience has proven, despite Louis XVI and his allies, that the opinion of the Jacobins and the popular clubs were those of the French Nation; no citizen has made them, and I did nothing other than share in them.{{sfn|Robespierre|1958|pp=83\u201384|loc= in Tome IX, Discours}} }}\n\nTurning the accusations upon his accusers, Robespierre delivered one of the most famous lines of the French Revolution to the Assembly:\n\n{{quote|I will not remind you that the sole object of contention dividing us is that you have instinctively defended all acts of new ministers, and we, of principles; that you seemed to prefer power, and we equality...

A commission was therefore established to examine the evidence against him while the Convention's Legislation Committee considered legal aspects of any future trial. Most Montagnards favoured judgment and execution, while the Girondins were more divided concerning how to proceed, with some arguing for royal inviolability, others for clemency, and others advocating lesser punishment or banishment.{{sfn|Kennedy|1988|pp=308\u201310}} On 13 November Robespierre stated in the Convention that a Constitution which Louis had violated himself, and which declared his inviolability, could not now be used in his defence.{{sfn|Robespierre|1958|loc= in Tome IX, Discours|pp=104\u201305, [https://fr.wikisource.org/w/index.php?title=Page:\u0152uvres_compl\u00e8tes_de_Maximilien_de_Robespierre,_tome_9.djvu/122 120].}} Robespierre had been taken ill and had done little other than support [[Louis Antoine de Saint-Just|Saint-Just]], a former colonel in the National Guard, who gave his first major speech to address and argue against the king's inviolability. On 20 November, opinion turned sharply against Louis following the discovery of a [[Armoire de fer|secret cache of 726 documents]] consisting of Louis's personal communications with bankers and ministers.{{sfn|Soboul|2005|loc= in \"Armoir de Fer\" by Grendron, F.|p=42}} At his trial, he claimed not to recognize documents clearly signed by himself.<ref>Hardman, John (2016) The life of Louis XVI, p. ?</ref>\n\nWith the question of the king's fate now occupying public discourse, Robespierre delivered on 3 December a speech that would define the rhetoric and course of Louis's trial.{{sfn|Thompson|1988|pp=292\u2013300}} All the deputies from the Mountain were asked to attend. Robespierre argued that the dethroned king could now function only as a threat to liberty and national peace and that the members of the Assembly were not to be impartial judges but rather statesmen with responsibility for ensuring public safety:\n\n{{quote|Louis was a king, and our republic is established; the critical question concerning you must be decided by these words alone. Louis was dethroned by his crimes; Louis denounced the French people as rebels; he appealed to chains, to the armies of tyrants who are his brothers; the victory of the people established that Louis alone was a rebel; Louis cannot, therefore, be judged; he already is judged. He is condemned, or the republic cannot be absolved. To propose to have a trial of Louis XVI, in whatever manner one may, is to retrogress to royal despotism and constitutionality; it is a counter-revolutionary idea because it places the revolution itself in litigation. In effect, if Louis may still be given a trial, he may be absolved, and innocent. What am I to say? He is presumed to be so until he is judged. But if Louis is absolved, if he may be presumed innocent, what becomes of the revolution? If Louis is innocent, all the defenders of liberty become slanderers. <!--Our enemies have been friends of the people and of truth and defenders of innocence oppressed; all the declarations of foreign courts are nothing more than the legitimate claims against an illegal faction. Even the detention that Louis has endured is, then, an unjust vexation; the f\u00e9d\u00e9r\u00e9s, the people of Paris, all the patriots of the French Empire are guilty; and this great trial in the court of nature judging between crime and virtue, liberty and tyranny, is at last decided in favour of crime and tyranny. Citizens, take warning; you are being fooled by false notions; you confuse positive, civil rights with the principles of the rights of mankind; you confuse the relationships of citizens amongst themselves with the connections between nations and an enemy that conspires against it; you confuse the situation of a people in revolution with that of a people whose government is affirmed; you confuse a nation that punishes a public functionary to conserve its form of government, and one that destroys the government itself. We are falling back upon ideas familiar to us, in an extraordinary case that depends upon principles we have never yet applied.-->{{sfn|Robespierre|1958|pp=121\u201322|loc= in Tome IX, Discours}}}}\n\nIn arguing for a judgment by the elected Convention without trial, Robespierre supported the recommendations of [[Jean-Baptiste Mailhe]], who headed the commission reporting on legal aspects of Louis's trial or judgment. Unlike some Girondins, Robespierre specifically opposed judgment by primary assemblies or a referendum, believing that this could cause a civil war.{{sfn|Soboul|2005|p=867|loc= in \"Proc\u00e8s du Roi\" by Dorigny, M}} While he called for a trial of Queen Marie-Antoinette and the imprisonment of the Dauphin, Robespierre advocated that the king be executed despite his opposition to capital punishment:\n\n{{quote|<!--As for myself, I abhor the death penalty administered by your laws, and for Louis I have neither love, nor hate; I hate only his crimes. I have demanded the abolition of the death penalty at your Constituent Assembly, and am not to blame if the first principles of reason appeared to you moral and political heresies. But if you will never reclaim these principles in favour of so much evil, the crimes of which belong less to you and more to the government, by what fatal error would you remember yourselves and plead for the greatest of criminals? You ask an exception to the death penalty for him alone who could legitimise it? -->Yes, the death penalty is, in general, crime, unjustifiable by the indestructible principles of nature, except in cases protecting the safety of individuals or the society altogether. Ordinary misdemeanours have never threatened public safety because society may always protect itself by other means, making those culpable powerless to harm it. But for a king dethroned in the bosom of a revolution, which is as yet cemented only by laws; a king whose name attracts the scourge of war upon a troubled nation; neither prison nor exile can render his existence inconsequential to public happiness; this cruel exception to the ordinary laws avowed by justice can be imputed only to the nature of his crimes.

Everything was arranged to the exact specifications that had been drawn up previously set before the ceremony.

He was able to speak of the things about which he was truly passionate, including virtue, nature, deist beliefs and his disagreements with atheism. He dressed elaborately, wearing feathers on his hat and holding fruit and flowers in his hands, and walked first in the festival procession.

Is it not He who, from the beginning of time, decreed for all the ages and for all peoples liberty, good faith, and justice? He did not create kings to devour the human race. He did not create priests to harness us, like vile animals, to the chariots of kings and to give to the world examples of baseness, pride, perfidy, avarice, debauchery and falsehood.

His goal in the Terror was to use the guillotine to create what he called a \"republic of virtue\", wherein virtue would be combined with terror.<ref name=\"chnm.gmu.edu\"/> <blockquote>Robespierre's main ideal was to ensure the virtue and sovereignty of the people. He disapproved of any acts which could be seen as exposing the nation to counter-revolutionaries and traitors and became increasingly fearful of the defeat of the Revolution. He instigated the Terror and the deaths of his peers as a measure of ensuring the Republic of Virtue but his ideals went beyond the needs and wants of the people of France. He became a threat to what he had wanted to ensure and the result was his downfall.{{sfn|Scurr|2006}}</blockquote>\n\nSoboul argues that Robespierre and Saint-Just \"were too preoccupied in defeating the interest of the bourgeoisie to give their total support to the sans-culottes, and yet too attentive to the needs of the sans-culottes to get support from the middle class.\"{{sfn|Ishay|1995|p=65}} According to [[R.R.

At the liberation, the municipal council (elected on 29 April 1945 with 27 communists, 12 socialists and 4 radicals out of 48 members), decided on 13 April 1946, to rename the Place du March\u00e9-Saint-Honor\u00e9  \u2018Place Robespierre\u2019, a decision approved at prefectorial level on 8 June. However in the wake of political changes in 1947, it reverted to its original name on 6 November 1950. Streets in the so-called \u2018Red belt\u2019 bear his name, e.g. at [[Montreuil, Seine-Saint-Denis|Montreuil]]. There is also a [[Robespierre (Paris M\u00e9tro)|Metro station \u2018Robespierre\u2019]] on Line 9 (Mairie de Montreuil - Pont de S\u00e8vres), in the commune of Montreuil, named during the era of the [[Popular Front (France)|\nPopular Front]].\nThere are, however, numerous streets, roads and squares named for him elsewhere in France.<ref>See https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximilien_de_Robespierre#Voies_publiques</ref>\n\n==== Plaques and monuments ====\n===== Arras =====\n\n* On 14 Octobre 1923, a plaque was placed on the house at 9 Rue Maximilien Robespierre (formerly Rue des Rapporteurs) rented by the three Robespierre siblings in 1787-1789, in the presence of the mayor Gustave Lemelle, Albert Mathiez and Louis Jacob, president of the [[Rosati]]. Built in 1730, the house has had a varied history as a typing school, and a craftsmen\u2019s museum, but is now being developed as a Robespierre Museum.  \n* In 1994, a plaque was unveiled by ARBR on the fa\u00e7ade of the Carrauts\u2019 brewery on the Rue Ronville, where Maximilien and Augustin were brought up by their grandparents.\n* An [[Art Deco]] marble bust by Maurice Cladel was intended to be displayed in the gardens of the former [[Abbey of Saint-Vaast]]. A mixture of politics and concerns about weathering led to it being placed in the [[H\u00f4tel de Ville, Arras|H\u00f4tel de Ville]]. After many years in a tribunal room, it can now be seen in the Salle Robespierre. Bronze casts of the bust were made for the bicentenary and are displayed in his former home on Rue Maximilien Robespierre and at the Lyc\u00e9e Robespierre, unveiled in 1990.\n\n===== Paris and elsewhere =====\n* Robespierre is commemorated by two plaques in Paris, one on the exterior of the Duplays\u2019 house, now 398 [[rue Saint-Honor\u00e9]], the other, erected by the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des \u00e9tudes robespierristes in the [[Conciergerie]].\n* In 1909, a committee presided over by [[Ren\u00e9 Viviani]] and [[Georges Clemenceau]] proposed erecting a statue in the garden of the [[Tuileries]], but press hostility and failure to garner enough public subscriptions led to its abandonment. However, Robespierre is recognisable in [[Fran\u00e7ois-L\u00e9on Sicard]]\u2019s marble Altar of the [[National Convention]] (1913), originally intended for the gardens of the Tuileries and now in the [[Panth\u00e9on]]. \n* A stone bust by Albert S\u00e9raphin (1949) stands in the square Robespierre, opposite the theatre in [[Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis|Saint-Denis]], with the inscription: \u201cMaximilien Robespierre l'Incorruptible 1758-1794\u201d.<ref>See Ren\u00e9 & Peter van der Krogt, ''Statues \u2013 Hither & Thither'' for photographs: https://statues.vanderkrogt.net/object.php?webpage=ST&record=frif030</ref>\n* Charles Correia\u2019s 1980s bronze sculptural group at the Coll\u00e8ge Robespierre in [[\u00c9pinay-sur-Seine]] depicts him and [[Louis Antoine de Saint-Just]] at a table, working on the 1793 Constitution and Declaration of Human Rights.<ref>See ''Seine-Saint-D\u00e9nis Atlas de l\u2019architecture et du patrimoine''for photographs by Agn\u00e8s Paty: https://patrimoine.seinesaintdenis.fr/spip.php?page=document&id_document=1028036</ref>  A mural in the school also depicts him.<ref>See D\u00e9partement Seine-Saint-D\u00e9nis ''Atlas de l\u2019architecture et du patrimoine'': https://patrimoine.seinesaintdenis.fr/spip.php?page=document&id_document=1028019</ref>\n* In 1986, [[Claude-Andr\u00e9 Deseine]]\u2019s terracotta bust of 1791 was bought for the new [[Mus\u00e9e de la R\u00e9volution fran\u00e7aise]] at [[Vizille]].
