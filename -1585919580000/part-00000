The rebellion saw many of the school windows broken and its furniture burnt before the boys withdrew to an island on the school grounds. A local [[justice of the peace]] read the [[Riot Act]], while soldiers crossed the island's moat from the rear and took the boys prisoner.\n\nThe rebellion was only one of several that took place at Rugby. The school was not alone in seeing disruption: several other public schools also saw trouble between 1710 and 1832.\n\n==Rugby School and discipline in 18th century public schools==\n[[Rugby School]]\u2014founded in 1567\u2014was one of the original seven [[Public school (United Kingdom)|public schools]], along with [[Winchester College|Winchester]], founded in 1382; [[Eton College]], founded in 1440; [[Shrewsbury School|Shrewsbury]], founded in 1552; [[Westminster School|Westminster]], founded in 1560; [[Harrow School|Harrow]], founded in 1571; [[Charterhouse School|Charterhouse]], founded in 1611.{{sfn|Honey|1989|p=152}}{{sfn|Dunning|Sheard|2005|p=35}}\n\nDiscipline at public schools in the 18th and 19th centuries was poor. According to the [[sociologist]]s Kenneth Sheard and [[Eric Dunning]], the reason lay in the balance of power between pupils and masters. Because the children of the [[upper class]] had previously been educated at home by tutors, these took the position of paid staff, and were therefore seen as socially inferior by their pupils.

Discursive, poststructural, ethnomethodological, ethnographic, phenomenological, positivist and experimental approaches can all be seen in action during the study of [[language]] and [[gender]], producing and reproducing what [[Susan Speer]] has described as 'different, and often competing, theoretical and political assumptions about the way discourse, ideology and gender identity should be conceived and understood'.<ref>{{cite book | last = Speer | first = Susan | author-link = Susan Speer | chapter = Introduction: feminism, discourse and conversation analysis | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=mp4oaHvYz74C&pg=PA7 | editor-last1 = Speer | editor-first1 = Susan A. | editor-link1 = Susan Speer | title = Gender talk: feminism, discourse and conversation analysis | pages = 7\u20138 | publisher = Routledge | location = London New York | year = 2005 | isbn = 9780415246446 | ref = harv }}</ref> As a result, research in this area can perhaps most usefully be divided into two main areas of study: first, there is a broad and sustained interest in the varieties of speech associated with a particular gender; also a related interest in the social norms and conventions that (re)produce gendered language use (a [[Variety (linguistics)|variety of speech]], or [[sociolect]] associated with a particular gender which is sometimes called a '''genderlect)'''<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite journal|last=Attenborough|first=Frederick|date=2014-05-02|title=Words, Contexts, Politics|journal=Gender and Language|volume=8|issue=2|pages=137\u2013146|doi=10.1558/genl.v8i2.137|issn=1747-6321}}</ref>.

These researches were related to the [[women's liberation movement]], and their goal was to discover the linkage between language usage and gender asymmetries. Since, feminists have been working on the ways that language is maintaining the existing [[patriarchy]] and [[sexism]].<ref name=\":13\">{{Cite book|title=Language and gender : a reader|date=2011|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|others=Coates, Jennifer, 1942-, Pichler, Pia.|isbn=9781405191449|edition=2nd|location=Chichester, West Sussex, U.K.|oclc=659305823}}</ref> There are two significant questions in the studies of language and gender. One of them is about the presence of gender bias in languages, and the other one is about the differences between genders while using the language. These two questions, however, have divided the field into two separate areas.<ref name=\":03\" />\n\nOne of the most outstanding sentiments in these studies is the concept of power. Researchers have been trying to understand the patterns of language to show how it can reflect the power imbalance in society. Some of them believe that men have social advantages which can be seen in the men's usage of language. Also, some of them think that there are women\u2019s disadvantages in society which are reflected in language.<ref name=\":03\" /> [[Robin Lakoff]], whose book \"[[Language and Woman's Place|Language ''and Woman's Place'']]''\"'' is the first official research in this field<ref name=\":03\" />, once argued that: \"the marginality and powerlessness of women is reflected in both the ways men and women are expected to speak and the ways in which women are spoken of.\" <ref>{{Cite book|title=Language and woman's place : text and commentaries|last=Lakoff, Robin Tolmach.|date=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|others=Bucholtz, Mary, 1966-|isbn=0195167589|edition=Rev. and expanded|location=New York|oclc=52706078}}</ref> For example, some feminist language researchers have tried to find how the advantages of men had manifested in language. They argue how, in the past, philosophers, politicians, grammarians, linguists, and others were men who have had control over language, so they entered their sexist thoughts in it as a means to regulate their domination.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Man made language|last=Spender, Dale.|date=1985|publisher=Routledge & Kegan Paul|isbn=0710203152|edition=2nd|location=London|oclc=12072141}}</ref> Therefore, this field is looking for the ways a language can contribute to inequality and sexism in society.<ref name=\":03\" />\n\n== Language and Power ==\nIn the past, many feminist language researchers used to believe that power is something separate from the language, which helps powerful groups, for example, men, to dominate the way language is being produced and used in society.<ref name=\":04\" /> Nowadays, some researchers consider that power is embedded in the language structures rather than being outside of it.<ref name=\":04\">{{Cite book|title=Gender, language and discourse|last=Weatherall, Ann, 1964-|date=2002|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0203988817|location=Hove [England]|oclc=71813163}}</ref> For instance, the language of science helps to regulate the ideas of the dominant groups in it, which can never be completely neutral.<ref name=\":4\" /> Even in psychology, the interpretations of gender had always some benefits for the academics who were writing about it, so it was always important that who is using the language and how they are using it to explain something.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|title=Body politics : power, sex, and nonverbal communication|last=Henley, Nancy.|date=1977|publisher=Prentice-Hall|isbn=0130796409|location=Englewood Cliffs, N.J.|oclc=2646276|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/bodypoliticspowe00henl}}</ref>\n\nThe norms of appropriate ways of talking for different genders are an example of the concept of power in language.<ref name=\":04\" /> There are many social forces to determine the ways different genders are supposed to communicate with each other.<ref name=\":04\" /> As these norms are the results of the present [[hierarchy]] in society, doubting them leads to challenging the social orders which originate these patterns.<ref name=\":04\" /> Many studies in this field presume that there are gender differences in language use; therefore, they examine how different genders vary in their speech styles. However, This approach does not incorporate the debate that who, initially, decided to set these differences and norms, and why these norms are generally accepted.<ref name=\":04\" /> \"Language is a complex and dynamic system that produces meaning about social categories such as gender\".<ref name=\":04\" /> In this sense, power is not something outside this system, but it is a part of it.<ref name=\":04\" />\n\nThe notion of gender is not static. Rather, this notion varies from culture to culture and time to time.<ref name=\":04\" /> \"[[Femininity|Feminine]]\" and \"[[Masculinity|Masculine]]\" are socially constructed concepts that through a set of repeated acts, have become natural.<ref name=\":14\">{{Cite book|title=Language and gender : a reader|date=2011|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|others=Coates, Jennifer, 1942-, Pichler, Pia.|isbn=9781405191449|edition=2nd|location=Chichester, West Sussex, U.K.|oclc=659305823}}</ref> [[Simone de Beauvoir]]'s famous dictum manifests this idea: \"one is not born, but rather becomes a woman.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=The second sex|last=Beauvoir, Simone de, 1908-1986.|date=2009|publisher=Jonathan Cape|others=Borde, Constance., Malovany-Chevallier, Sheila.|isbn=9780224078597|location=London|oclc=429598256}}</ref> Accordingly, performing acts following social norms leads to the phenomenon of gendered speech. As femininity and masculinity are not fixed concepts, their style of talking can also be as a result of power relations in society regulating social standards.<ref name=\":14\" />\n\nIn each society, the notion of gender is being learned from early childhood through conversation, humor, parenting, institutions, media, and other ways of imparting knowledge. Hence, gender seems a natural and even scientific concept to all the individuals of a society. Many scholars have been trying to not only find the truth behind this common sense but also understand why this concept is taking for granted. This kind of research requires to question some underlying assumptions about gender, and approach this concept from a different point of view.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=Language and gender|last=Eckert, Penelope.|date=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|others=McConnell-Ginet, Sally.|isbn=0-511-07765-3|location=Cambridge|oclc=57419689}}</ref> Gender is not something people born with, but people learn to perform and act based on the expected norms of it, which has nothing to do with physiology and hormones.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=West|first=Candace|last2=Zimmerman|first2=Don H.|date=1987|title=Doing Gender|journal=Gender and Society|volume=1|issue=2|pages=125\u2013151|issn=0891-2432|jstor=189945|doi=10.1177/0891243287001002002}}</ref>\n\nIn the matter of linguistic competence- the ability to produce knowledge and understand it via language-, sociolinguistics and linguist anthropologists believe that only knowledge of structure and morphology cannot help a person to communicate with others. Instead, they think that one needs to know the social norms people use in different languages in order to interact with them. People gradually learn how to use language in specific social situations and develop communicative competence. Therefore, language and social norms are dynamic and interconnected. As people use language in respect to these norms, it plays a vital role in manifesting and sustaining social standards<ref name=\":2\" /> and can be a tool for reproducing power relations and gender oppression.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|title=Introduction: Gender, language and translation at the crossroads of disciplines {{!}} Castro {{!}} Gender and Language|url=https://journals.equinoxpub.com/index.php/GL/article/view/16185|doi=10.1558/genl.v7i1.5}}</ref> One of the examples to show this interconnection would be the fact that there is no equivalent for \"sir\" to use in addressing a female [[authority]]. This fact cannot be related to the language itself, but it is correlated to the perception that authorities have always been male.<ref name=\":2\" /> The other example is the way women get addressed by [[Miss]], [[Mrs.]], or [[Ms.]], while Men are only addressed by [[Mr.]], which is a term that shows their [[gender]], not [[marital status]].

Descriptions of women's speech as deficient can actually be dated as far back as [[Otto Jespersen|Otto Jespersen's]] \"The Woman\", a chapter in his 1922 book ''Language: Its Nature and Development, and Origin.''<ref name=\"Jespersen\">{{cite book | last = Jespersen | first = Otto | author-link = Otto Jespersen | chapter = The woman | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=6jtXmwEACAAJ | title = Language: its nature, development, and origin | publisher = Hamlin Press | location = | origyear = 1922 | year = 2013 | isbn = 9781473302310 }}</ref> Jespersen's idea that women's speech is deficient relative to a male norm went largely unchallenged until Lakoff's work appeared fifty years later.<ref name=Wolfram/>  Nevertheless, despite the political incorrectness of the chapter's language from a modern perspective, Jespersen's contributions remain relevant.  These include the prospect of language change based on social and gendered opportunity, lexical and phonological differences, and the idea of genderlects and gender roles influence language.\n\nNot long after the publication of ''Language and Woman's Place'', other scholars began to produce studies that both challenged Lakoff's arguments and expanded the field of language and gender studies.<ref name=Bucholtz/><ref name=Wolfram/> One refinement of the deficit argument is the so-called \"dominance approach\", which posits that gender differences in language reflect power differences in society.<ref name=\"OBarr\">{{cite book | last1 = O'Barr | first1 = William | last2 = Atkins | first2 = Bowman | chapter = 'Women's language' or 'powerless language' | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=KpM_AAAAMAAJ | editor-last1 = Borker | editor-first1 = Ruth | editor-last2 = Furman | editor-first2 = Nelly | editor-last3 = MacConnel-Ginet | editor-first3 = Sally | title = Women and language in literature and society | pages = [https://archive.org/details/womenlanguageinl00mccorich/page/93 93&ndash;110] | publisher = Praeger | location = New York | year = 1980 | isbn = 9780030578939 | url = https://archive.org/details/womenlanguageinl00mccorich/page/93 }}</ref>\n\n[[Jennifer Coates]] outlines the historical range of approaches to gendered speech in her book ''Women, Men and Language''.<ref>{{cite book | last = Coates | first = Jennifer | title = Women, men and language: a sociolinguistic account of gender differences in language | publisher = Routledge | location = Milton Park, Abingdon, Oxon New York, NY | url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ZU1ACwAAQBAJ  | year = 2016 | edition = 3rd | isbn = 9781317292531 }}</ref>  She contrasts the four approaches known as the deficit, dominance, difference, and dynamic approaches.\n\n''Deficit'' is an approach attributed to Jespersen that defines adult male language as the standard, and women's language as deficient.<ref name=\"Jespersen\" />  This approach created a dichotomy between women's language and men's language.  This triggered criticism to the approach in that highlighting issues in women's language by using men's as a benchmark.  As such, women's language was considered to have something inherently 'wrong' with it.\n\n''Dominance'' is an approach whereby the female sex is seen as the subordinate group whose difference in style of speech results from male supremacy and also possibly an effect of patriarchy. This results in a primarily male-centered language. Scholars such as Dale Spender<ref>{{cite book | last = Spender | first = Dale | title = Man made language | publisher = New York University Press | location = London New York New York | year = 1998 | edition = 2nd | isbn = 9780863584015 | url = https://archive.org/details/manmadelanguage00spen }}</ref> and Don Zimmerman and Candace West<ref>{{cite book | last1 = West | first1 = Candace | last2 = Zimmerman | first2 = Don H. | chapter = Small insults: a study of interruptions in conversations between unacquainted persons | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=xiliAAAAMAAJ | editor-last1 = Thorne | editor-first1 = Barrie | editor-last2 = Kramarae | editor-first2 = Cheris | editor-last3 = Main Henley | editor-first3 = Nancy | title = Language, gender, and society | pages = [https://archive.org/details/languagegenderso00thorrich/page/102 102&ndash;117] | publisher = Newbury House | location = Rowley, Massachusetts | year = 1983 | isbn = 9780883772683 | url = https://archive.org/details/languagegenderso00thorrich/page/102 }}</ref> subscribe to this view.\n\n''Difference'' is an approach of equality, differentiating men and women as belonging to different 'sub-cultures' as they have been socialised to do so since childhood. This then results in the varying communicative styles of men and women. Deborah Tannen is a major advocate of this position.<ref name=YJDU>{{cite book | last = Tannen | first = Deborah | title = You just don't understand: women and men in conversation | publisher = Morrow | location = New York, NY | year = 1990 | url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=evwRw4SkF8MC | isbn = 9780060959623 }}</ref> Tannen compares gender differences in language to cultural differences. Comparing conversational goals, she argues that men tend to use a \"report style\", aiming to communicate factual information, whereas women more often use a \"rapport style\", which is more concerned with building and maintaining relationships.<ref name=YJDU />\n\nThe \"dynamic\" or \"[[social constructionist]]\" approach is, as Coates describes, the most current approach to language and gender.  Instead of speech falling into a natural gendered category, the dynamic nature and multiple factors of an interaction help a socially appropriate gendered construct.  As such, West and Zimmerman describe these constructs as \"[[doing gender]]\" instead of the speech itself necessarily being classified in a particular category.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = West | first1 = Candace | last2 = Zimmerman | first2 = Don H. | title = Doing gender | journal = [[Gender & Society]] | volume = 1 | issue = 2 | pages = 125&ndash;151 | doi = 10.1177/0891243287001002002 | jstor = 189945 | date = June 1987 | ref = harv }} [https://campus.fsu.edu/bbcswebdav/institution/academic/social_sciences/sociology/Reading%20Lists/Social%20Psych%20Prelim%20Readings/IV.%20Structures%20and%20Inequalities/1987%20West%20Zimmerman%20-%20Doing%20Gender.pdf Pdf.]</ref> This is to say that these social constructs, while affiliated with particular genders, can be utilized by speakers as they see fit.\n\nScholars including Tannen and others argue that differences are pervasive across media, including face-to-face conversation,<ref name=\"Fitzpatrick\">{{cite journal | last1 = Fitzpatrick | first1 = Mary Anne | last2 = Mulac | first2 = Anthony | last3 = Dindia | first3 = Kathryn | title = Gender-preferential language use in spouse and stranger interaction | journal = [[Journal of Language and Social Psychology]] | volume = 14 | issue = 1&ndash;2 | pages = 18&ndash;39 | doi = 10.1177/0261927x95141002 | date = March 1995 | ref = harv }}</ref><ref name=HannahMurachver>{{cite journal | last1 = Hannah | first1 = Annette | last2 = Murachver | first2 = Tamar | title = Gender and conversational style as predictors of conversational behavior | journal = [[Journal of Language and Social Psychology]] | volume = 18 | issue = 2 | pages = 153&ndash;174 | doi = 10.1177/0261927x99018002002 | date = June 1999 | ref = harv }}</ref> written essays of primary school children,<ref name=\"Mulac\">{{cite journal | last1 = Mulac | first1 = Anthony | last2 = Studley | first2 = Lisa B.  | last3 = Blau | first3 = Sheridan | title = The gender-linked language effect in primary and secondary students' impromptu essays | journal = [[Sex Roles (journal)|Sex Roles]] | volume = 23 | issue = 9&ndash;10 | pages = 439&ndash;470 | doi = 10.1007/bf00289762 | date = November 1990 | ref = harv }}</ref> email,<ref name=\"Thomson\">{{cite journal | last1 = Thomson | first1 = Rob | last2 = Murachver | first2 = Tamar | title = Predicting gender from electronic discourse | journal = [[British Journal of Social Psychology]] | volume = 40 | issue = 2 | pages = 193&ndash;208 | doi = 10.1348/014466601164812 | date = June 2001 | pmid = 11446227 | ref = harv }}</ref> and even toilet graffiti.<ref name=\"Green\">{{cite journal | last = Green | first = James A. | title = The writing on the stall: gender and graffiti | journal = [[Journal of Language and Social Psychology]] | volume = 22 | issue = 3 | pages = 282&ndash;296 | doi = 10.1177/0261927X03255380 | date = September 2003 | ref = harv }}</ref>\n\nDeborah Cameron, among other scholars, argues that there are problems with both the dominance and the difference approach. Cameron notes that throughout the history of scholarship on language and gender male-associated forms have been seen as the [[Markedness|unmarked norm]] from which the female deviates.<ref>{{cite book | last = Cameron | first = Deborah | author-link = Deborah Cameron (linguist) | title = Verbal hygiene | publisher = Routledge | location = Milton Park, Abingdon, Oxon New York | year = 2012 | isbn = 9786613954404 }}</ref> For example, the norm 'manager' becomes the marked form 'manageress' when referring to a female counterpart. On the other hand, Cameron argues that what the difference approach labels as different ways of using or understanding language are actually displays of differential power. Cameron suggests, \"It is comforting to be told that nobody needs to 'feel awful': that there are no real conflicts, only misunderstandings. ... But the research evidence does not support the claims made by Tannen and others about the nature, the causes, and the prevalence of male-female miscommunication.\"<ref>{{cite book | last = Cameron | first = Deborah | author-link = Deborah Cameron (linguist) | title = The myth of Mars and Venus: do men and women really speak different languages | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford New York | year = 2007 | isbn = 9780199214471 }}</ref> She argues that social differences between men's and women's roles are not clearly reflected in language use. One additional example is a study she has done on call center operators in the UK, where these operators are trained to be scripted in what they say and to perform the necessary '[[emotional labor]]' (smiling, expressive intonation, showing rapport/empathy and giving minimal responses) for their customer-callers. This emotional labor is commonly associated with the feminine domain, and the call center service workers are also typically females. However, the male workers in this call center do not orient to the covertly gendered meanings when they are tasked to perform this emotional labor. While this does not mean that the 'woman's language' is revalued, nor does this necessarily call for a feminist celebration, Cameron highlights that it is possible that with time, more men may work in this service industry, and this may lead to a subsequent \"de-gendering\" of this linguistic style.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Cameron | first = Deborah | author-link = Deborah Cameron (linguist) | title = Styling the worker: gender and the commodification of language in the globalized service economy | journal = [[Journal of Sociolinguistics]] | volume = 4 | issue = 3 | pages = 323&ndash;347 | doi = 10.1111/1467-9481.00119 | date = August 2000 | ref = harv }} [https://is.muni.cz/el/1423/podzim2010/GEN144/um/CAMERON_Styling_the_Worker.pdf Pdf.]</ref>\n\nCommunication styles are always a product of context, and as such, gender differences tend to be most pronounced in single-gender groups. One explanation for this, is that people [[Communication Accommodation Theory|accommodate]] their language towards the style of the person they are interacting with. Thus, in a mixed-gender group, gender differences tend to be less pronounced. A similarly important observation is that this accommodation is usually towards the language style, not the gender of the person. That is, a polite and empathic male will tend to be accommodated to on the basis of their being polite and empathic, rather than their being male.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Thomson | first1 = Rob | last2 = Murachver | first2 = Tamar | last3 = Green | first3 = James | title = Where Is the gender in gendered language?  | journal = [[Psychological Science]] | volume = 12 | issue = 2 | pages = 171&ndash;175 | doi = 10.1111/1467-9280.00329 | pmid = 11340928 | date = March 2001 | ref = harv }}</ref>\n\nHowever, Ochs argues that gender can be indexed directly and indirectly.<ref>{{cite book | last = Ochs | first = Elinor | chapter = Indexing gender | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Jh59S6WIS98C&pg=PA338 | editor-last1 = Duranti | editor-first1 = Alessandro | editor-last2 = Goodwin | editor-first2 = Charles | title = Rethinking context : language as an interactive phenomenon | pages = [https://archive.org/details/rethinkingcontex0000unse/page/335 335&ndash;357] | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge England New York | year = 1992 | isbn = 9780521422888 | url = https://archive.org/details/rethinkingcontex0000unse/page/335 }}</ref> Direct indexicality is the primary relationship between linguistics resources (such as lexicon, morphology, syntax, phonology, dialect and language) and gender. For example, the pronouns \"he\" and \"she\" directly indexes \"male\" and \"female\". However, there can be a secondary relationship between linguistic resources and gender where the linguistic resources can index certain acts, activities or stances which then indirectly index gender. In other words, these linguistic resources help constitute gender. Examples include the Japanese particles \"wa\" and \"ze\". The former directly index delicate intensity, which then indirectly indexes the female \"voice\" while the latter directly indexes coarse intensity, which then indirectly indexes the male \"voice\".\n\nWomen are generally believed to speak a better \"language\" than men do.

They analyzed randomly selected interactive dialogue taken once from every ten minutes of their tapes. Mulac et al. collected data for 37 language variables, from which they determined the thirteen that showed significant differences between usage by male and female characters. Mulac et al.'s definitions of these thirteen features are as follows:<ref name=\":0\" />\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Vocalized Pauses\n|Utterance without semantic meaning (uh, um, etc.)&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\n|-\n!Verbs\n|(See '''[[verb]]''' page)&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\n|-\n!Uncertainty Verbs\n|Verb phrase that shows some level of uncertainty ('I'm not sure if...', 'It might be', etc.)&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\n|-\n!Action Verbs\n|Verbs that specify physical action&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\n|-\n!Present Tense Verbs\n|Verb phrases in the present tense, including but not limited to habitual actions and historical present&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\n|-\n!Adverbials Begin Sentence\n|Tells how, when, or where a sentence or phrase takes place ('Yesterday, I went to Taco Bell')\n|-\n!Justifiers\n|Gives reason/justification for a previous utterance or action&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\n|-\n!Judgmental Adjectives\n|Indicates a personal and subjective opinion/evaluation&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\n|-\n!Concrete Nouns\n|[[Noun]]s that can be perceived by one or more of the five senses&nbsp;\n|-\n!Subordinating Conjunctions\n|After, as soon as, until, etc. (See '''[[subordinating conjunction]]s''')&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\n|-\n!Grammatical Errors\n|Utterances which are viewed incorrect by a [[Linguistic prescription|prescriptivist grammar]]&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\n|-\n!Polite Forms\n|Utterances that express some degree of [[politeness]]&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\n|}\n\nThe following tended to be higher in frequency for males: vocalized pauses, action verbs, present tense verbs, justifiers, subordinating conjunctions, and grammatical \"errors\".

It typically is much easier to get to know a woman than it is to get to know a man.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}} It has been proven{{By whom|date=September 2013}} that women get to know someone on a more personal level and they are more likely to desire to share their feelings.\n\nIt has also been said{{By whom|date=September 2013}} that people share more via technology. The phenomenon is known as [[Computer-mediated communication|Computer Mediated Communication]], also known as CMC.  This form of communication typically involves text only messages that tend to lose their nonverbal cues.  Men and women are both more likely to self-disclose on the computer than they would be face to face.  People are more confident when using Computer Mediated Communication because communication is faceless, which makes it easier to divulge information.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}\n\nResearch has been conducted to examine whether self-disclosure in adult friendship differs according to gender and marital status. Sixty-seven women and fifty-three men were asked about intimate and non-intimate self-disclosure to closest same-sex friends. Disclosure to spouse among married respondents was also assessed. The intimate disclosure of married men to friends was lower than that of unmarried men, married women and unmarried women; the intimate disclosure of these last three groups was similar. Married people's non-intimate disclosure to friends was lower than that of unmarried people, regardless of gender. Married people's intimate disclosure to their spouses was high regardless of gender; in comparison, married men's intimate disclosure to their friends was low, while married women's disclosure to their friends was moderate or even as high as disclosure to their spouses. The results suggest that sex roles are not the only determinant of gender differences in disclosure to friends. Marital status appears to have an important influence on disclosure in friendship for men but not for women. It was concluded that research on gender differences in self-disclosure and friendship has neglected an important variable, that of marital status.\"<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Derlega | first1 = Valerian J. | last2 = Metts | first2 = Sandra | last3 = Petronio | first3 = Sandra  | last4 = Margulis | first4 = Stephen T.  | title = Self-disclosure | publisher = Sage Publications | location = Newbury Park | url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=j7m6QgAACAAJ | year = 1993 | isbn = 9780803939554 }}</ref> This research goes to show that when a man is married he is less likely to have intimate self-disclosure. This could be because a man may feel he is betraying his wife's confidence by disclosing information that might be considered private. However, the research also showed that the married women didn't change much in either situation, because women tend to self disclose more than men.\n\nMen tend to communicate differently with other men than they do with other women, while women tend to communicate the same with both men and women. \"Male and female American students who differed in masculinity and in femininity self-disclosed to a same-sex stranger in contexts that made either social/expressive motives or instrumental motives salient. The results were consistent with the primary assertion that measures of sex role identity are better predictors of contextual variations in self-disclosure than is sex per se. Sex consistently failed to predict subjects' willingness to self-disclose, both within and across contexts, whereas femininity promoted self-disclosure in the context that was clearly social and expressive in character. Although masculinity failed to exert the expected facilitative impact on self-disclosure within the instrumental context, it nonetheless influenced the results; androgynous subjects, who scored high in both masculinity and femininity, were more self-revealing across contexts than was any other group.\"<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Ashida | first1 = Sato | last2 = Koehly | first2 = Laura M. | last3 = Roberts | first3 = J.

Displaying strictly feminine or masculine traits will not be to one's advantage in communication, because it is important to be able to recognize and utilize these traits to be an effective communicator.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\nFrom a social skills perspective, gender, tunic, and cultural differences in relationships may stem, in part, from differences in communication. The influence of biological sex on communication values has received scholarly attention. In general, women value affectively oriented communication skills more than men, and men value instrumentally oriented communication skills more than women, although the effect size for these differences are generally small.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Anuradha | first = M. | title = Gender stereotyping in television commercials aimed at children in India | journal = Media Asia | volume = 39 | issue = 4 | pages = 209&ndash;215 | doi = 10.1080/01296612.2012.11689939 | date = 2012 | ref = harv }}</ref>\n\nSelf-disclosure is also very important when it comes to a close dating relationship between men and women. Successful communication in relationships is one of the greatest difficulties most couples are forced to overcome. Men in relationships with women may practice self-disclosure more often than their female partner. Self-disclosure is considered to be a key factor in facilitating intimacy. For example, American heterosexual couples were studied using various measures twice a year. By using the average scores of both partners, they found that self-disclosure was higher in those couples who remained together at the second administration of the surveys than in those who broke up between two administrations. Similarly, researchers asked heterosexual couples who had just begun dating to complete a self-disclosure measure and to answer the same questionnaire four months later. They found that couples who were still dating four months later reported greater self-disclosure at the initial contact than did those who later broke up. This test shows self-disclosure can be beneficial to facilitating a positive relationship. Self-disclosure is a process which typically begins rapidly, but then plateaus as the couple gains more information.  The initial self-disclosure is extremely important when first meeting someone. The first interactions between a potential couple could be deciding factors in the success or failure of the relationship.\n\nSelf-disclosure is difficult because not all women and men communicate the same.\n\n===Verbal aggression===\nAggression can be defined by its three intersecting counterparts: indirect, relational and social. Indirect aggression occurs when the victim is attacked through covert and concealed attempts to cause social suffering. Examples are gossiping, exclusion or ignoring of the victim. Relational aggression, while similar to indirect, is more resolute in its attentions. It can be a threat to terminate a friendship or spreading false rumors. The third type of aggression, social aggression, \"is directed toward damaging another's self-esteem, social status, or both, and may take direct forms such as verbal rejection, negative facial expressions or body movements, or more indirect forms such as slanderous rumors or social exclusion.\"<ref name=\"Blake, J.

In another experiment, social aggression was used to see if verbal and nonverbal behaviors contributed to a person's social value.<ref name=\"Blake, J.

When eight-, eleven- and fifteen-year-olds were compared, there were high reports of social aggression but no apparent statistical differences between the age groups.<ref name=\"Rosen, L. H. 2011\"/>\n\nSeveral studies have shown that social aggression and high academic performance are incompatible. In classrooms with a high achievement record, researchers were less likely to find social aggression. Vice versa can be found for classrooms with a low achievement record.<ref name=\"Garandeau\" />\n\nIn adolescence, social aggression boosts female's popularity by maintaining and controlling the social hierarchy. Furthermore, males are also ranked higher in popularity if they are physically aggressive. But, if males practice relational or social aggression then they are seen as unpopular among their peers.<ref name=\"Blake, J. J. 2011\"/> When it comes to different forms social aggression, males are more prone to use direct measures and females indirect.\n\nIn addition to gender, the conditions in which a child grows up in also affects the likelihood of aggression.<ref name=\"Rosen, L. H. 2011\"/> Children raised in a divorced, never married or low-income family are more likely to show social aggression. This is speculated because of the higher rates of conflict and fighting already in the household. Parents who use an aversive style of parenting can also contribute to the social aggression in their children.<ref name=\"Rosen, L. H. 2011\"/> Researchers venture that \"perhaps children who are treated harshly by parents have a higher baseline level of anger\u2026and may lack the opportunities to practice more direct, assertive strategies for conflict resolution so may be prone to maligning others or lashing out when they are angry.\"<ref name=\"Rosen, L. H. 2011\"/>\n\nThrough the last couple decades, the media has increased its influence over America's youth. In a study done measuring the aggressive acts committed by cartoon characters on television, out of 8927 minutes of programming time 7856 aggressive acts took place. This is roughly .88 aggressive acts per minute.<ref name=\"Luther, C. A. 2010\"/> Because television and cartoons are one of the main mediums for entertainment, these statistics can be troubling. If children relate to the characters, then they are more likely to commit similar acts of aggression. For teenagers, popular films and series such as ''[[Mean Girls]]'' (2004), ''[[Easy A]]'' (2010) and ''[[Gossip Girl (TV series)|Gossip Girl]]'' (2007) have shown an exaggerated, damaging view of how society works. Already, latest studies have shown an increase of social aggression in girls. Other experiments, such as one done by  [[Albert Bandura]], the [[Bobo doll experiment]], have shown similar results of society shaping your behavior because of the impact of a model.\n\nThe development of social aggression can be explained by the social identity theory and evolutionary perspective.<ref name=\"Cupach, William R. 2011\"/>\n\nThe social identity theory categorizes people into two groups, in-groups and out-groups. You see yourself as part of the in-group and people who are dissimilar to you as part of the out-group. In middle and high school these groups are known as cliques and can have several names. In the popular 2004 teen drama ''Mean Girls'', \"varsity jocks\", \"desperate wannabes\", \"over-sexed band geeks\", \"girls who eat their feelings\", \"cool Asians\" and \"the Plastics\" were several cliques from the movie.<ref name=\"Cupach, William R. 2011\"/> Two common middle and high school cliques seen in everyday life are the popular crowd, in-group, and everyone else, out-group. The out-group has several other divisions but for the most part the in-group will categorize the out-groups all as one.\n\nAround this time, it becomes important for a females social identity to be associated with the in-group. When a girl possess qualities that are valued in the in-group, then her social identity will increase. However, if her characteristics resemble those of the out-group, then she will be attack the out-group in order to keep her social standing within the in-group. This intergroup struggle, also known as social competition, mostly comes the in-group condemning the out-group, not the other way around.<ref name=\"Cupach, William R. 2011\"/>\n\nMoreover, social aggression can lead to intragroup competition. Inside the social groups there is also a hierarchal ranking, there are followers and there are leaders. When one's position in the group does not lead to positive self-identity, then the group members will feud with one another to increase status and power within the clique. Studies show that the closer a female is to her attacker, the less likely she is to forgive.<ref name=\"Cupach, William R. 2011\"/>\n\nWhere the social identity theory explains direct social aggression, research done in the evolutionary perspective explains indirect social aggression. This aggression stemmed from \"successful competition for scarce resources\u2026 and enables optimal growth and development.\"<ref name=\"Cupach, William R. 2011\"/> Two tactics used are the coercive and prosocial strategies. The coercive strategies involve controlling and regulating all resources of the out-group through a monopoly. For this scheme, one must rely heavily on threats and aggression. The other strategy, prosocial, involves helping and sharing resources. This method shows complete dominance for the in-group, because in order for others to survive they must subordinate themselves to receive resources. Ability to control resources effectively results in higher-ranking in the in-group, popular crowd.\n\nSocial aggression can be detrimental for both ends of the spectrum, the out-group and in-group members. Longitudinal studies prove that aggression can lead to victims feeling lonely and socially isolated. In addition, targets report feeling depressed and affected by other health risks such as headaches, sleepiness, abdominal pain and bedwetting.<ref name=\"Luther, C. A. 2010\"/> The aggressors on the other hand, were suggested to \"encounter future problems in social relationships or emotional difficulties during early childhood.\"<ref name=\"Luther, C. A. 2010\"/> In academics, victims were reported to having below average test scores and low achievement.\n\nStudies that measure cross-gender differences show that females find social aggression to be more hurtful than males do. The results of the hurt and pain felt by female victims can be seen in all ages.<ref name=\"Cupach, William R. 2011\"/> Pre-school teachers have reported several cases of female students feeling depressed. In high school, the female victims begin to slowly isolate themselves. A year later, this seclusion has led to social phobia. Furthermore, in college, pressure and aggression from Greek life has lowered life satisfaction and increased antisocial behavior in several female students.\n\nWhile social aggression has several downfalls, it has also led to a mature social competence of males and females. Being part of an in-group can increase a person's self-worth and contribute to his or her personal identity. In terms of the evolutionary perspective, being able to control definite and indefinite resources can increase a person's social competence.<ref name=\"Cupach, William R. 2011\"/> Some research argues that reports of social aggression and bullying can teach students in school what is considered unacceptable behavior. In a 1998 survey, 60% of students found that bullying \"makes kids tougher.\"<ref name=\"Cupach, William R. 2011\"/> However, there is additional need for support on this claim.\n\nSince 1992, there have been nine school intervention and prevention programs, which have met the rigorous criteria of efficacy, to avert social aggression.<ref name=\"Leff, S. R. 2010\">{{cite journal | last1 = Leff | first1 = Stephen S. | last2 = Waasdorp | first2 = Tracy Evian | last3 = Crick | first3 = Nicki R. | title = A review of existing relational aggression programs: strengths, limitations, and future directions | journal = [[School Psychology Review]] | volume = 39 | issue = 4 | pages = 508&ndash;535 | pmc = 3111222 | date = 2010 | url = http://www.nasponline.org/publications/periodicals/spr/volume-39/volume-39-issue-4/a-review-of-existing-relational-aggression-programs-strengths-limitations-and-future-directions | ref = harv | pmid=21666876}}</ref> The programs include Early Childhood Friendship Project (2009), You Can't Say You Can't Play (1992), I Can Problem Solve (2008), Walk Away, Ignore, Talk, Seek Help (2003), Making Choices: Social Problem Skills for Children (2005), Friend to Friend (2009), Second Step (2002), Social Aggression Prevention Program (2006), Sisters of Nia (2004).\n\nWhen designing a prevention program, it is important to remember to keep the program age and gender appropriate.<ref name=\"Leff, S. R. 2010\"/> For example, Early Childhood Friendship Project and You Can't Say You Can't Play have visual activities for the preschoolers and integrate puppet shows into the lesson plan. In addition, because males and females approach aggression differently there must be personalized plans to fit both genders.\n\nHowever, intervention programs even with the best intentions can be harmful.<ref name=\"Cupach, William R. 2011\"/> For one, the progress of the intervention can be short lived. Studies have measured the effectiveness of intervention programs three separate times during the course of one year and no improvements were shown. Secondly, because social aggression is said to increase social identity and belonging to a group, many students have tried to disrupt the programs. A third implication is that the interventions need to study how adverse behaviors develop. Otherwise the solution might not fit the problem. Lastly, the programs must be designed to fit the needs of girls and boys and not the ones of the researchers. If the intervention program is designed to give insight for research rather than reducing and bettering aggression, then it can be detrimental to society.\n\nAlthough a few forms of behavior may be sex-specific, in general they reflect patterns of power and control between the sexes, which are found in all human groups, regardless of sex composition. These modes of behaviors are perhaps more appropriately labeled 'powerlects' instead of 'genderlects'.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Lamb | first = Theodore A. | title = Nonverbal and paraverbal control in Dyads and Triads: sex or power differences? | journal = [[Social Psychology Quarterly]] | volume = 44 | issue = 1 | pages = 49&ndash;53 | doi = 10.2307/3033863 | date = March 1981 | ref = harv | jstor = 3033863 }}</ref>\n\n===Listening and attentiveness===\nIn a conversation, meaning does not reside in the words spoken, but is filled in by the person listening.  Each person decides if they think others are speaking in the spirit of differing status or symmetrical connection. The likelihood that individuals will tend to interpret someone else's words as one or the other depends more on the hearer's own focus, concerns, and habits than on the spirit in which the words were intended.<ref name=YJDU />\n\nIt appears that women attach more weight than men to the importance of [[Empathy|listening]] in conversation, with its connotations of power to the listener as confidant of the speaker. This attachment of import by women to listening is inferred by women's normally lower rate of interruption &mdash; i.e., disrupting the flow of conversation with a topic unrelated to the previous one<ref name=\"PFishman\">{{cite news | last = Fishman | first = Pamela | title = Interactional shitwork | volume = 1 | issue = 2 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170321032801/http://heresiesfilmproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/heresies2.pdf | archive-date = 21 March 2017 | url = http://heresiesfilmproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/heresies2.pdf | work = [[Heresies: A Feminist Publication on Art and Politics]] | pages = 99&ndash;101 | date = May 1977 }}</ref> &mdash; and by their largely increased use of minimal responses in relation to men.<ref name=\"ZimmWest\"/> Men, however, interrupt far more frequently with non-related topics, especially in the mixed sex setting and, far from rendering a female speaker's responses minimal, are apt to greet her conversational spotlights with silence, as the work of Victoria DeFrancisco demonstrates.<ref name=\"DeFrancisco\"/>\n\nWhen men talk, women listen and agree.  However men tend to misinterpret this agreement, which was intended in a spirit of connection, as a reflection of status and power.  A man might conclude that a woman is indecisive or insecure as a result of her listening and attempts of acknowledgment.  When in all actuality, a woman's reasons for behaving this way have nothing to do with her attitudes toward her knowledge, but are a result of her attitudes toward her relationships. The act of giving information frames the speaker with a higher status, while the act of listening frames the listener as lower.  However, when women listen to men, they are not necessarily thinking in terms of status, but in terms of connection and support.<ref name=YJDU />\n\n===Heterosexual relationships===\n\nAs described [[#Studies|above]], there are certain stereotypes society places on the way men and women communicate. Men are stereotyped to be more of a public speaker and leader, while women are stereotyped to talk more in private among their family and friends. For women, society views their use of communication as a way to express feelings and emotions. For men, society views their use of communication as a way to express power and negotiate status among other individuals.<ref name=YJDU /> There are also certain societal stereotypes about how men and women communicate within a heterosexual marriage or relationship. When a man and a women are communicating within their relationship, the traditional language roles are altered. The man becomes more passive and the woman becomes more active. A man's stereotypical silent communication style is often disappointing for women, while a woman's emotionally articulate communication style is often seen as aggravating for a man.<ref name=YJDU /> This creates the assumption that women and men have opposing communication styles, therefore creating society's cliche that men and women don't understand each other.\n\n===Dominance versus subjection===\nThis, in turn, suggests a dichotomy between a male desire for conversational dominance \u2013 noted by Helena Leet-Pellegrini with reference to male experts speaking more verbosely than their female counterparts \u2013 and a female aspiration to group conversational participation.<ref name=\"Leet\">{{cite book | last = Leet-Pellegrini | first = Helena M. | chapter = Conversational dominance as a function of gender and expertise | chapter-url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=8w1iAAAAMAAJ | editor-last1 = Giles | editor-first1 = Howard | editor-last2 = Robinson | editor-first2 = W.

Power is reflected in every aspect of communication from what the actual topic of the communication, to the ways in which it is communicated.  Women are typically less concerned with power more concerned with forming and maintaining relationships, whereas men are more concerned with their status. Girls and women feel it is crucial that they be liked by their peers, a form of involvement that focuses on symmetrical connection.  Boys and men feel it is crucial that they be respected by their peers, as form of involvement that focuses on asymmetrical status.<ref>{{cite book | last = Tannen | first = Deborah | title = I only say this because I love you | publisher = Virago | location = London | year = 2003 | isbn = 9781860499814 }}</ref> These differences in priorities are reflected in the ways in which men and women communicate.  A woman's communication will tend to be more focused on building and maintaining relationships.  Men on the other hand, will place a higher priority on power, their communication styles will reflect their desire to maintain their status in the relationship.\n\nAccording to Tannen's research, men tend to tell stories as another way to maintain their status.  Primarily, men tell jokes, or stories that focus on themselves.  Women on the other hand, are less concerned with their own power, and therefore their stories revolve not around themselves, but around others. By putting themselves on the same level as those around them, women attempt to downplay their part in their own stories, which strengthens their connections to those around them.\n\n===Politeness===\nLakoff identified three forms of politeness: formal, deference, and camaraderie. Women's language is characterized by formal and deference politeness, whereas men's language is exemplified by camaraderie.<ref name=\"Lakoff, R. 1975\"/>\n\nThere is a generalization about conservativeness and politeness in women's speech. It is commonly believed that women are gentle, while men are rough and rude. Since there is no evidence for the total accuracy of this perception, researchers have tried to examine the reasons behind it. Statistics show a pattern that women tend to use more \"standard\" variable of the language. For example, in the case of negative concord, e.g., I didn't do anything vs. I didn't do nothing,&nbsp;women usually use the standard form.<ref name=\":12\" /> Pierre Bourdieu introduced the concept of the linguistic marketplace. According to this concept, different varieties of language have different values. When people want to be accepted in a diplomatic organization, they need to have a range of knowledge to show their competency. Possessing the right language is as important as the right style of dress. Both of these manners have social values.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bourdieu|first=Pierre|date=1977-12-01|title=The economics of linguistic exchanges|journal=Information (International Social Science Council)|language=en|volume=16|issue=6|pages=645\u2013668|doi=10.1177/053901847701600601}}</ref> While Bourdieu focuses on the diplomatic corps, it would be true if people want to be accepted in other contexts such as an urban ghetto. The market that one wants to engage with has a profound effect on the value of the variation of language they may use.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Woolard|first=Kathryn A.|date=1985|title=Language Variation and Cultural Hegemony: Toward an Integration of Sociolinguistic and Social Theory|journal=American Ethnologist|volume=12|issue=4|pages=738\u2013748|issn=0094-0496|jstor=644180|doi=10.1525/ae.1985.12.4.02a00090}}</ref> The relations of each gender to linguistic markets are different. A research on the pronunciation of English in Norwich has shown that women's usage is considerably more conservative regarding the standard variation of the language they speak.

It can be the standard one, or the polite version of it, or the so-called \"right\" one.<ref name=\":12\" />\n\n==Gender-specific vocabulary==\nSome natural languages have intricate systems of gender-specific [[vocabulary]].\n\n* [[Irish Sign Language]], due to single sex Deaf schools, developed separate male and female vocabularies which can still be seen today.\n*  It is speculated that [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] women had a special language called ''Emesal'', distinct from the main language, ''Emegir'', which was spoken by both genders. The women's language had a distinct vocabulary, found in the records of religious rituals to be performed by women, also in the speech of goddesses in mythological texts. There has been some dispute about the role of Emesal, with suggestions by some scholars that Emegir was a dialect used by the public and more informally while Emesal was a literary language.<ref>{{cite book | last = Whittaker | first = Gordon | chapter = Linguistic anthropology and the study of Emesal as (a) women's language | chapter-url = https://www.scribd.com/document/45691958/Whittaker-Linguistic-Anthropology-and-Emesal | editor-last1 = Parpola | editor-first1 = Simo | editor-last2 = Whiting | editor-first2 = Robert M. | title = Sex and gender in the ancient Near East: proceedings of the 47th Rencontre Assyriologique Internationale, Helsinki, July 2-6, 2001 | pages = 633&ndash;644 | publisher = Neo-Assyrian Text Corpus Project | location = Helsinki | year = 2002 | isbn = 9789514590542 }}</ref>\n* For a significant period of time in the history of the ancient [[languages of India]], after the formal language [[Sanskrit]] diverged from the popular [[Prakrit]] languages, some Sanskrit plays recorded the speech of women in Prakrit, distinct from the Sanskrit of male speakers.

One of them is about the presence of gender bias in languages, and the other one is about the differences between genders while using the language. These two questions, however, have divided the field into two separate areas.<ref name=\":03\" />\n\nOne of the most outstanding sentiments in these studies is the concept of power. Researchers have been trying to understand the patterns of language to show how it can reflect the power imbalance in society.

Hence, gender seems a natural and even scientific concept to all the individuals of a society.

Instead, they think that one needs to know the social norms people use in different languages in order to interact with them. People gradually learn how to use language in specific social situations and develop communicative competence. Therefore, language and social norms are dynamic and interconnected.

This triggered criticism to the approach in that highlighting issues in women's language by using men's as a benchmark.  As such, women's language was considered to have something inherently 'wrong' with it.\n\n''Dominance'' is an approach whereby the female sex is seen as the subordinate group whose difference in style of speech results from male supremacy and also possibly an effect of patriarchy. This results in a primarily male-centered language. Scholars such as Dale Spender<ref>{{cite book | last = Spender | first = Dale | title = Man made language | publisher = New York University Press | location = London New York New York | year = 1998 | edition = 2nd | isbn = 9780863584015 | url = https://archive.org/details/manmadelanguage00spen }}</ref> and Don Zimmerman and Candace West<ref>{{cite book | last1 = West | first1 = Candace | last2 = Zimmerman | first2 = Don H. | chapter = Small insults: a study of interruptions in conversations between unacquainted persons | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=xiliAAAAMAAJ | editor-last1 = Thorne | editor-first1 = Barrie | editor-last2 = Kramarae | editor-first2 = Cheris | editor-last3 = Main Henley | editor-first3 = Nancy | title = Language, gender, and society | pages = [https://archive.org/details/languagegenderso00thorrich/page/102 102&ndash;117] | publisher = Newbury House | location = Rowley, Massachusetts | year = 1983 | isbn = 9780883772683 | url = https://archive.org/details/languagegenderso00thorrich/page/102 }}</ref> subscribe to this view.\n\n''Difference'' is an approach of equality, differentiating men and women as belonging to different 'sub-cultures' as they have been socialised to do so since childhood. This then results in the varying communicative styles of men and women. Deborah Tannen is a major advocate of this position.<ref name=YJDU>{{cite book | last = Tannen | first = Deborah | title = You just don't understand: women and men in conversation | publisher = Morrow | location = New York, NY | year = 1990 | url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=evwRw4SkF8MC | isbn = 9780060959623 }}</ref> Tannen compares gender differences in language to cultural differences.

Instead of speech falling into a natural gendered category, the dynamic nature and multiple factors of an interaction help a socially appropriate gendered construct.  As such, West and Zimmerman describe these constructs as \"[[doing gender]]\" instead of the speech itself necessarily being classified in a particular category.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = West | first1 = Candace | last2 = Zimmerman | first2 = Don H. | title = Doing gender | journal = [[Gender & Society]] | volume = 1 | issue = 2 | pages = 125&ndash;151 | doi = 10.1177/0891243287001002002 | jstor = 189945 | date = June 1987 | ref = harv }} [https://campus.fsu.edu/bbcswebdav/institution/academic/social_sciences/sociology/Reading%20Lists/Social%20Psych%20Prelim%20Readings/IV.%20Structures%20and%20Inequalities/1987%20West%20Zimmerman%20-%20Doing%20Gender.pdf Pdf.]</ref> This is to say that these social constructs, while affiliated with particular genders, can be utilized by speakers as they see fit.\n\nScholars including Tannen and others argue that differences are pervasive across media, including face-to-face conversation,<ref name=\"Fitzpatrick\">{{cite journal | last1 = Fitzpatrick | first1 = Mary Anne | last2 = Mulac | first2 = Anthony | last3 = Dindia | first3 = Kathryn | title = Gender-preferential language use in spouse and stranger interaction | journal = [[Journal of Language and Social Psychology]] | volume = 14 | issue = 1&ndash;2 | pages = 18&ndash;39 | doi = 10.1177/0261927x95141002 | date = March 1995 | ref = harv }}</ref><ref name=HannahMurachver>{{cite journal | last1 = Hannah | first1 = Annette | last2 = Murachver | first2 = Tamar | title = Gender and conversational style as predictors of conversational behavior | journal = [[Journal of Language and Social Psychology]] | volume = 18 | issue = 2 | pages = 153&ndash;174 | doi = 10.1177/0261927x99018002002 | date = June 1999 | ref = harv }}</ref> written essays of primary school children,<ref name=\"Mulac\">{{cite journal | last1 = Mulac | first1 = Anthony | last2 = Studley | first2 = Lisa B.  | last3 = Blau | first3 = Sheridan | title = The gender-linked language effect in primary and secondary students' impromptu essays | journal = [[Sex Roles (journal)|Sex Roles]] | volume = 23 | issue = 9&ndash;10 | pages = 439&ndash;470 | doi = 10.1007/bf00289762 | date = November 1990 | ref = harv }}</ref> email,<ref name=\"Thomson\">{{cite journal | last1 = Thomson | first1 = Rob | last2 = Murachver | first2 = Tamar | title = Predicting gender from electronic discourse | journal = [[British Journal of Social Psychology]] | volume = 40 | issue = 2 | pages = 193&ndash;208 | doi = 10.1348/014466601164812 | date = June 2001 | pmid = 11446227 | ref = harv }}</ref> and even toilet graffiti.<ref name=\"Green\">{{cite journal | last = Green | first = James A. | title = The writing on the stall: gender and graffiti | journal = [[Journal of Language and Social Psychology]] | volume = 22 | issue = 3 | pages = 282&ndash;296 | doi = 10.1177/0261927X03255380 | date = September 2003 | ref = harv }}</ref>\n\nDeborah Cameron, among other scholars, argues that there are problems with both the dominance and the difference approach. Cameron notes that throughout the history of scholarship on language and gender male-associated forms have been seen as the [[Markedness|unmarked norm]] from which the female deviates.<ref>{{cite book | last = Cameron | first = Deborah | author-link = Deborah Cameron (linguist) | title = Verbal hygiene | publisher = Routledge | location = Milton Park, Abingdon, Oxon New York | year = 2012 | isbn = 9786613954404 }}</ref> For example, the norm 'manager' becomes the marked form 'manageress' when referring to a female counterpart. On the other hand, Cameron argues that what the difference approach labels as different ways of using or understanding language are actually displays of differential power. Cameron suggests, \"It is comforting to be told that nobody needs to 'feel awful': that there are no real conflicts, only misunderstandings. ... But the research evidence does not support the claims made by Tannen and others about the nature, the causes, and the prevalence of male-female miscommunication.\"<ref>{{cite book | last = Cameron | first = Deborah | author-link = Deborah Cameron (linguist) | title = The myth of Mars and Venus: do men and women really speak different languages | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford New York | year = 2007 | isbn = 9780199214471 }}</ref> She argues that social differences between men's and women's roles are not clearly reflected in language use. One additional example is a study she has done on call center operators in the UK, where these operators are trained to be scripted in what they say and to perform the necessary '[[emotional labor]]' (smiling, expressive intonation, showing rapport/empathy and giving minimal responses) for their customer-callers. This emotional labor is commonly associated with the feminine domain, and the call center service workers are also typically females. However, the male workers in this call center do not orient to the covertly gendered meanings when they are tasked to perform this emotional labor. While this does not mean that the 'woman's language' is revalued, nor does this necessarily call for a feminist celebration, Cameron highlights that it is possible that with time, more men may work in this service industry, and this may lead to a subsequent \"de-gendering\" of this linguistic style.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Cameron | first = Deborah | author-link = Deborah Cameron (linguist) | title = Styling the worker: gender and the commodification of language in the globalized service economy | journal = [[Journal of Sociolinguistics]] | volume = 4 | issue = 3 | pages = 323&ndash;347 | doi = 10.1111/1467-9481.00119 | date = August 2000 | ref = harv }} [https://is.muni.cz/el/1423/podzim2010/GEN144/um/CAMERON_Styling_the_Worker.pdf Pdf.]</ref>\n\nCommunication styles are always a product of context, and as such, gender differences tend to be most pronounced in single-gender groups. One explanation for this, is that people [[Communication Accommodation Theory|accommodate]] their language towards the style of the person they are interacting with. Thus, in a mixed-gender group, gender differences tend to be less pronounced. A similarly important observation is that this accommodation is usually towards the language style, not the gender of the person. That is, a polite and empathic male will tend to be accommodated to on the basis of their being polite and empathic, rather than their being male.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Thomson | first1 = Rob | last2 = Murachver | first2 = Tamar | last3 = Green | first3 = James | title = Where Is the gender in gendered language?  | journal = [[Psychological Science]] | volume = 12 | issue = 2 | pages = 171&ndash;175 | doi = 10.1111/1467-9280.00329 | pmid = 11340928 | date = March 2001 | ref = harv }}</ref>\n\nHowever, Ochs argues that gender can be indexed directly and indirectly.<ref>{{cite book | last = Ochs | first = Elinor | chapter = Indexing gender | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Jh59S6WIS98C&pg=PA338 | editor-last1 = Duranti | editor-first1 = Alessandro | editor-last2 = Goodwin | editor-first2 = Charles | title = Rethinking context : language as an interactive phenomenon | pages = [https://archive.org/details/rethinkingcontex0000unse/page/335 335&ndash;357] | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge England New York | year = 1992 | isbn = 9780521422888 | url = https://archive.org/details/rethinkingcontex0000unse/page/335 }}</ref> Direct indexicality is the primary relationship between linguistics resources (such as lexicon, morphology, syntax, phonology, dialect and language) and gender. For example, the pronouns \"he\" and \"she\" directly indexes \"male\" and \"female\". However, there can be a secondary relationship between linguistic resources and gender where the linguistic resources can index certain acts, activities or stances which then indirectly index gender. In other words, these linguistic resources help constitute gender. Examples include the Japanese particles \"wa\" and \"ze\". The former directly index delicate intensity, which then indirectly indexes the female \"voice\" while the latter directly indexes coarse intensity, which then indirectly indexes the male \"voice\".\n\nWomen are generally believed to speak a better \"language\" than men do.

They analyzed randomly selected interactive dialogue taken once from every ten minutes of their tapes. Mulac et al. collected data for 37 language variables, from which they determined the thirteen that showed significant differences between usage by male and female characters. Mulac et al.'s definitions of these thirteen features are as follows:<ref name=\":0\" />\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Vocalized Pauses\n|Utterance without semantic meaning (uh, um, etc.)&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\n|-\n!Verbs\n|(See '''[[verb]]''' page)&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\n|-\n!Uncertainty Verbs\n|Verb phrase that shows some level of uncertainty ('I'm not sure if...', 'It might be', etc.)&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\n|-\n!Action Verbs\n|Verbs that specify physical action&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\n|-\n!Present Tense Verbs\n|Verb phrases in the present tense, including but not limited to habitual actions and historical present&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\n|-\n!Adverbials Begin Sentence\n|Tells how, when, or where a sentence or phrase takes place ('Yesterday, I went to Taco Bell')\n|-\n!Justifiers\n|Gives reason/justification for a previous utterance or action&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\n|-\n!Judgmental Adjectives\n|Indicates a personal and subjective opinion/evaluation&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\n|-\n!Concrete Nouns\n|[[Noun]]s that can be perceived by one or more of the five senses&nbsp;\n|-\n!Subordinating Conjunctions\n|After, as soon as, until, etc. (See '''[[subordinating conjunction]]s''')&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\n|-\n!Grammatical Errors\n|Utterances which are viewed incorrect by a [[Linguistic prescription|prescriptivist grammar]]&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\n|-\n!Polite Forms\n|Utterances that express some degree of [[politeness]]&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\n|}\n\nThe following tended to be higher in frequency for males: vocalized pauses, action verbs, present tense verbs, justifiers, subordinating conjunctions, and grammatical \"errors\".

It typically is much easier to get to know a woman than it is to get to know a man.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}} It has been proven{{By whom|date=September 2013}} that women get to know someone on a more personal level and they are more likely to desire to share their feelings.\n\nIt has also been said{{By whom|date=September 2013}} that people share more via technology. The phenomenon is known as [[Computer-mediated communication|Computer Mediated Communication]], also known as CMC.  This form of communication typically involves text only messages that tend to lose their nonverbal cues.  Men and women are both more likely to self-disclose on the computer than they would be face to face.  People are more confident when using Computer Mediated Communication because communication is faceless, which makes it easier to divulge information.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}\n\nResearch has been conducted to examine whether self-disclosure in adult friendship differs according to gender and marital status. Sixty-seven women and fifty-three men were asked about intimate and non-intimate self-disclosure to closest same-sex friends. Disclosure to spouse among married respondents was also assessed. The intimate disclosure of married men to friends was lower than that of unmarried men, married women and unmarried women; the intimate disclosure of these last three groups was similar. Married people's non-intimate disclosure to friends was lower than that of unmarried people, regardless of gender. Married people's intimate disclosure to their spouses was high regardless of gender; in comparison, married men's intimate disclosure to their friends was low, while married women's disclosure to their friends was moderate or even as high as disclosure to their spouses. The results suggest that sex roles are not the only determinant of gender differences in disclosure to friends. Marital status appears to have an important influence on disclosure in friendship for men but not for women. It was concluded that research on gender differences in self-disclosure and friendship has neglected an important variable, that of marital status.\"<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Derlega | first1 = Valerian J. | last2 = Metts | first2 = Sandra | last3 = Petronio | first3 = Sandra  | last4 = Margulis | first4 = Stephen T.  | title = Self-disclosure | publisher = Sage Publications | location = Newbury Park | url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=j7m6QgAACAAJ | year = 1993 | isbn = 9780803939554 }}</ref> This research goes to show that when a man is married he is less likely to have intimate self-disclosure. This could be because a man may feel he is betraying his wife's confidence by disclosing information that might be considered private. However, the research also showed that the married women didn't change much in either situation, because women tend to self disclose more than men.\n\nMen tend to communicate differently with other men than they do with other women, while women tend to communicate the same with both men and women. \"Male and female American students who differed in masculinity and in femininity self-disclosed to a same-sex stranger in contexts that made either social/expressive motives or instrumental motives salient. The results were consistent with the primary assertion that measures of sex role identity are better predictors of contextual variations in self-disclosure than is sex per se. Sex consistently failed to predict subjects' willingness to self-disclose, both within and across contexts, whereas femininity promoted self-disclosure in the context that was clearly social and expressive in character. Although masculinity failed to exert the expected facilitative impact on self-disclosure within the instrumental context, it nonetheless influenced the results; androgynous subjects, who scored high in both masculinity and femininity, were more self-revealing across contexts than was any other group.\"<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Ashida | first1 = Sato | last2 = Koehly | first2 = Laura M. | last3 = Roberts | first3 = J.

Displaying strictly feminine or masculine traits will not be to one's advantage in communication, because it is important to be able to recognize and utilize these traits to be an effective communicator.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\nFrom a social skills perspective, gender, tunic, and cultural differences in relationships may stem, in part, from differences in communication. The influence of biological sex on communication values has received scholarly attention. In general, women value affectively oriented communication skills more than men, and men value instrumentally oriented communication skills more than women, although the effect size for these differences are generally small.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Anuradha | first = M. | title = Gender stereotyping in television commercials aimed at children in India | journal = Media Asia | volume = 39 | issue = 4 | pages = 209&ndash;215 | doi = 10.1080/01296612.2012.11689939 | date = 2012 | ref = harv }}</ref>\n\nSelf-disclosure is also very important when it comes to a close dating relationship between men and women. Successful communication in relationships is one of the greatest difficulties most couples are forced to overcome. Men in relationships with women may practice self-disclosure more often than their female partner. Self-disclosure is considered to be a key factor in facilitating intimacy. For example, American heterosexual couples were studied using various measures twice a year. By using the average scores of both partners, they found that self-disclosure was higher in those couples who remained together at the second administration of the surveys than in those who broke up between two administrations. Similarly, researchers asked heterosexual couples who had just begun dating to complete a self-disclosure measure and to answer the same questionnaire four months later. They found that couples who were still dating four months later reported greater self-disclosure at the initial contact than did those who later broke up. This test shows self-disclosure can be beneficial to facilitating a positive relationship. Self-disclosure is a process which typically begins rapidly, but then plateaus as the couple gains more information.  The initial self-disclosure is extremely important when first meeting someone. The first interactions between a potential couple could be deciding factors in the success or failure of the relationship.\n\nSelf-disclosure is difficult because not all women and men communicate the same.\n\n===Verbal aggression===\nAggression can be defined by its three intersecting counterparts: indirect, relational and social. Indirect aggression occurs when the victim is attacked through covert and concealed attempts to cause social suffering. Examples are gossiping, exclusion or ignoring of the victim. Relational aggression, while similar to indirect, is more resolute in its attentions. It can be a threat to terminate a friendship or spreading false rumors. The third type of aggression, social aggression, \"is directed toward damaging another's self-esteem, social status, or both, and may take direct forms such as verbal rejection, negative facial expressions or body movements, or more indirect forms such as slanderous rumors or social exclusion.\"<ref name=\"Blake, J.

In another experiment, social aggression was used to see if verbal and nonverbal behaviors contributed to a person's social value.<ref name=\"Blake, J.

When eight-, eleven- and fifteen-year-olds were compared, there were high reports of social aggression but no apparent statistical differences between the age groups.<ref name=\"Rosen, L. H. 2011\"/>\n\nSeveral studies have shown that social aggression and high academic performance are incompatible. In classrooms with a high achievement record, researchers were less likely to find social aggression. Vice versa can be found for classrooms with a low achievement record.<ref name=\"Garandeau\" />\n\nIn adolescence, social aggression boosts female's popularity by maintaining and controlling the social hierarchy. Furthermore, males are also ranked higher in popularity if they are physically aggressive. But, if males practice relational or social aggression then they are seen as unpopular among their peers.<ref name=\"Blake, J. J. 2011\"/> When it comes to different forms social aggression, males are more prone to use direct measures and females indirect.\n\nIn addition to gender, the conditions in which a child grows up in also affects the likelihood of aggression.<ref name=\"Rosen, L. H. 2011\"/> Children raised in a divorced, never married or low-income family are more likely to show social aggression. This is speculated because of the higher rates of conflict and fighting already in the household. Parents who use an aversive style of parenting can also contribute to the social aggression in their children.<ref name=\"Rosen, L. H. 2011\"/> Researchers venture that \"perhaps children who are treated harshly by parents have a higher baseline level of anger\u2026and may lack the opportunities to practice more direct, assertive strategies for conflict resolution so may be prone to maligning others or lashing out when they are angry.\"<ref name=\"Rosen, L. H. 2011\"/>\n\nThrough the last couple decades, the media has increased its influence over America's youth. In a study done measuring the aggressive acts committed by cartoon characters on television, out of 8927 minutes of programming time 7856 aggressive acts took place. This is roughly .88 aggressive acts per minute.<ref name=\"Luther, C. A. 2010\"/> Because television and cartoons are one of the main mediums for entertainment, these statistics can be troubling. If children relate to the characters, then they are more likely to commit similar acts of aggression. For teenagers, popular films and series such as ''[[Mean Girls]]'' (2004), ''[[Easy A]]'' (2010) and ''[[Gossip Girl (TV series)|Gossip Girl]]'' (2007) have shown an exaggerated, damaging view of how society works. Already, latest studies have shown an increase of social aggression in girls. Other experiments, such as one done by  [[Albert Bandura]], the [[Bobo doll experiment]], have shown similar results of society shaping your behavior because of the impact of a model.\n\nThe development of social aggression can be explained by the social identity theory and evolutionary perspective.<ref name=\"Cupach, William R. 2011\"/>\n\nThe social identity theory categorizes people into two groups, in-groups and out-groups. You see yourself as part of the in-group and people who are dissimilar to you as part of the out-group. In middle and high school these groups are known as cliques and can have several names. In the popular 2004 teen drama ''Mean Girls'', \"varsity jocks\", \"desperate wannabes\", \"over-sexed band geeks\", \"girls who eat their feelings\", \"cool Asians\" and \"the Plastics\" were several cliques from the movie.<ref name=\"Cupach, William R. 2011\"/> Two common middle and high school cliques seen in everyday life are the popular crowd, in-group, and everyone else, out-group. The out-group has several other divisions but for the most part the in-group will categorize the out-groups all as one.\n\nAround this time, it becomes important for a females social identity to be associated with the in-group. When a girl possess qualities that are valued in the in-group, then her social identity will increase. However, if her characteristics resemble those of the out-group, then she will be attack the out-group in order to keep her social standing within the in-group. This intergroup struggle, also known as social competition, mostly comes the in-group condemning the out-group, not the other way around.<ref name=\"Cupach, William R. 2011\"/>\n\nMoreover, social aggression can lead to intragroup competition. Inside the social groups there is also a hierarchal ranking, there are followers and there are leaders. When one's position in the group does not lead to positive self-identity, then the group members will feud with one another to increase status and power within the clique. Studies show that the closer a female is to her attacker, the less likely she is to forgive.<ref name=\"Cupach, William R. 2011\"/>\n\nWhere the social identity theory explains direct social aggression, research done in the evolutionary perspective explains indirect social aggression. This aggression stemmed from \"successful competition for scarce resources\u2026 and enables optimal growth and development.\"<ref name=\"Cupach, William R. 2011\"/> Two tactics used are the coercive and prosocial strategies. The coercive strategies involve controlling and regulating all resources of the out-group through a monopoly. For this scheme, one must rely heavily on threats and aggression. The other strategy, prosocial, involves helping and sharing resources. This method shows complete dominance for the in-group, because in order for others to survive they must subordinate themselves to receive resources. Ability to control resources effectively results in higher-ranking in the in-group, popular crowd.\n\nSocial aggression can be detrimental for both ends of the spectrum, the out-group and in-group members. Longitudinal studies prove that aggression can lead to victims feeling lonely and socially isolated. In addition, targets report feeling depressed and affected by other health risks such as headaches, sleepiness, abdominal pain and bedwetting.<ref name=\"Luther, C. A. 2010\"/> The aggressors on the other hand, were suggested to \"encounter future problems in social relationships or emotional difficulties during early childhood.\"<ref name=\"Luther, C. A. 2010\"/> In academics, victims were reported to having below average test scores and low achievement.\n\nStudies that measure cross-gender differences show that females find social aggression to be more hurtful than males do. The results of the hurt and pain felt by female victims can be seen in all ages.<ref name=\"Cupach, William R. 2011\"/> Pre-school teachers have reported several cases of female students feeling depressed. In high school, the female victims begin to slowly isolate themselves. A year later, this seclusion has led to social phobia. Furthermore, in college, pressure and aggression from Greek life has lowered life satisfaction and increased antisocial behavior in several female students.\n\nWhile social aggression has several downfalls, it has also led to a mature social competence of males and females. Being part of an in-group can increase a person's self-worth and contribute to his or her personal identity. In terms of the evolutionary perspective, being able to control definite and indefinite resources can increase a person's social competence.<ref name=\"Cupach, William R. 2011\"/> Some research argues that reports of social aggression and bullying can teach students in school what is considered unacceptable behavior. In a 1998 survey, 60% of students found that bullying \"makes kids tougher.\"<ref name=\"Cupach, William R. 2011\"/> However, there is additional need for support on this claim.\n\nSince 1992, there have been nine school intervention and prevention programs, which have met the rigorous criteria of efficacy, to avert social aggression.<ref name=\"Leff, S. R. 2010\">{{cite journal | last1 = Leff | first1 = Stephen S. | last2 = Waasdorp | first2 = Tracy Evian | last3 = Crick | first3 = Nicki R. | title = A review of existing relational aggression programs: strengths, limitations, and future directions | journal = [[School Psychology Review]] | volume = 39 | issue = 4 | pages = 508&ndash;535 | pmc = 3111222 | date = 2010 | url = http://www.nasponline.org/publications/periodicals/spr/volume-39/volume-39-issue-4/a-review-of-existing-relational-aggression-programs-strengths-limitations-and-future-directions | ref = harv | pmid=21666876}}</ref> The programs include Early Childhood Friendship Project (2009), You Can't Say You Can't Play (1992), I Can Problem Solve (2008), Walk Away, Ignore, Talk, Seek Help (2003), Making Choices: Social Problem Skills for Children (2005), Friend to Friend (2009), Second Step (2002), Social Aggression Prevention Program (2006), Sisters of Nia (2004).\n\nWhen designing a prevention program, it is important to remember to keep the program age and gender appropriate.<ref name=\"Leff, S. R. 2010\"/> For example, Early Childhood Friendship Project and You Can't Say You Can't Play have visual activities for the preschoolers and integrate puppet shows into the lesson plan. In addition, because males and females approach aggression differently there must be personalized plans to fit both genders.\n\nHowever, intervention programs even with the best intentions can be harmful.<ref name=\"Cupach, William R. 2011\"/> For one, the progress of the intervention can be short lived. Studies have measured the effectiveness of intervention programs three separate times during the course of one year and no improvements were shown. Secondly, because social aggression is said to increase social identity and belonging to a group, many students have tried to disrupt the programs. A third implication is that the interventions need to study how adverse behaviors develop. Otherwise the solution might not fit the problem. Lastly, the programs must be designed to fit the needs of girls and boys and not the ones of the researchers. If the intervention program is designed to give insight for research rather than reducing and bettering aggression, then it can be detrimental to society.\n\nAlthough a few forms of behavior may be sex-specific, in general they reflect patterns of power and control between the sexes, which are found in all human groups, regardless of sex composition. These modes of behaviors are perhaps more appropriately labeled 'powerlects' instead of 'genderlects'.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Lamb | first = Theodore A. | title = Nonverbal and paraverbal control in Dyads and Triads: sex or power differences? | journal = [[Social Psychology Quarterly]] | volume = 44 | issue = 1 | pages = 49&ndash;53 | doi = 10.2307/3033863 | date = March 1981 | ref = harv | jstor = 3033863 }}</ref>\n\n===Listening and attentiveness===\nIn a conversation, meaning does not reside in the words spoken, but is filled in by the person listening.  Each person decides if they think others are speaking in the spirit of differing status or symmetrical connection. The likelihood that individuals will tend to interpret someone else's words as one or the other depends more on the hearer's own focus, concerns, and habits than on the spirit in which the words were intended.<ref name=YJDU />\n\nIt appears that women attach more weight than men to the importance of [[Empathy|listening]] in conversation, with its connotations of power to the listener as confidant of the speaker. This attachment of import by women to listening is inferred by women's normally lower rate of interruption &mdash; i.e., disrupting the flow of conversation with a topic unrelated to the previous one<ref name=\"PFishman\">{{cite news | last = Fishman | first = Pamela | title = Interactional shitwork | volume = 1 | issue = 2 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170321032801/http://heresiesfilmproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/heresies2.pdf | archive-date = 21 March 2017 | url = http://heresiesfilmproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/heresies2.pdf | work = [[Heresies: A Feminist Publication on Art and Politics]] | pages = 99&ndash;101 | date = May 1977 }}</ref> &mdash; and by their largely increased use of minimal responses in relation to men.<ref name=\"ZimmWest\"/> Men, however, interrupt far more frequently with non-related topics, especially in the mixed sex setting and, far from rendering a female speaker's responses minimal, are apt to greet her conversational spotlights with silence, as the work of Victoria DeFrancisco demonstrates.<ref name=\"DeFrancisco\"/>\n\nWhen men talk, women listen and agree.  However men tend to misinterpret this agreement, which was intended in a spirit of connection, as a reflection of status and power.  A man might conclude that a woman is indecisive or insecure as a result of her listening and attempts of acknowledgment.  When in all actuality, a woman's reasons for behaving this way have nothing to do with her attitudes toward her knowledge, but are a result of her attitudes toward her relationships. The act of giving information frames the speaker with a higher status, while the act of listening frames the listener as lower.  However, when women listen to men, they are not necessarily thinking in terms of status, but in terms of connection and support.<ref name=YJDU />\n\n===Heterosexual relationships===\n\nAs described [[#Studies|above]], there are certain stereotypes society places on the way men and women communicate. Men are stereotyped to be more of a public speaker and leader, while women are stereotyped to talk more in private among their family and friends. For women, society views their use of communication as a way to express feelings and emotions. For men, society views their use of communication as a way to express power and negotiate status among other individuals.<ref name=YJDU /> There are also certain societal stereotypes about how men and women communicate within a heterosexual marriage or relationship. When a man and a women are communicating within their relationship, the traditional language roles are altered. The man becomes more passive and the woman becomes more active. A man's stereotypical silent communication style is often disappointing for women, while a woman's emotionally articulate communication style is often seen as aggravating for a man.<ref name=YJDU /> This creates the assumption that women and men have opposing communication styles, therefore creating society's cliche that men and women don't understand each other.\n\n===Dominance versus subjection===\nThis, in turn, suggests a dichotomy between a male desire for conversational dominance \u2013 noted by Helena Leet-Pellegrini with reference to male experts speaking more verbosely than their female counterparts \u2013 and a female aspiration to group conversational participation.<ref name=\"Leet\">{{cite book | last = Leet-Pellegrini | first = Helena M. | chapter = Conversational dominance as a function of gender and expertise | chapter-url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=8w1iAAAAMAAJ | editor-last1 = Giles | editor-first1 = Howard | editor-last2 = Robinson | editor-first2 = W.

Power is reflected in every aspect of communication from what the actual topic of the communication, to the ways in which it is communicated.  Women are typically less concerned with power more concerned with forming and maintaining relationships, whereas men are more concerned with their status. Girls and women feel it is crucial that they be liked by their peers, a form of involvement that focuses on symmetrical connection.  Boys and men feel it is crucial that they be respected by their peers, as form of involvement that focuses on asymmetrical status.<ref>{{cite book | last = Tannen | first = Deborah | title = I only say this because I love you | publisher = Virago | location = London | year = 2003 | isbn = 9781860499814 }}</ref> These differences in priorities are reflected in the ways in which men and women communicate.  A woman's communication will tend to be more focused on building and maintaining relationships.  Men on the other hand, will place a higher priority on power, their communication styles will reflect their desire to maintain their status in the relationship.\n\nAccording to Tannen's research, men tend to tell stories as another way to maintain their status.  Primarily, men tell jokes, or stories that focus on themselves.  Women on the other hand, are less concerned with their own power, and therefore their stories revolve not around themselves, but around others. By putting themselves on the same level as those around them, women attempt to downplay their part in their own stories, which strengthens their connections to those around them.\n\n===Politeness===\nLakoff identified three forms of politeness: formal, deference, and camaraderie. Women's language is characterized by formal and deference politeness, whereas men's language is exemplified by camaraderie.<ref name=\"Lakoff, R. 1975\"/>\n\nThere is a generalization about conservativeness and politeness in women's speech. It is commonly believed that women are gentle, while men are rough and rude. Since there is no evidence for the total accuracy of this perception, researchers have tried to examine the reasons behind it. Statistics show a pattern that women tend to use more \"standard\" variable of the language. For example, in the case of negative concord, e.g., I didn't do anything vs. I didn't do nothing,&nbsp;women usually use the standard form.<ref name=\":12\" /> Pierre Bourdieu introduced the concept of the linguistic marketplace. According to this concept, different varieties of language have different values. When people want to be accepted in a diplomatic organization, they need to have a range of knowledge to show their competency. Possessing the right language is as important as the right style of dress. Both of these manners have social values.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bourdieu|first=Pierre|date=1977-12-01|title=The economics of linguistic exchanges|journal=Information (International Social Science Council)|language=en|volume=16|issue=6|pages=645\u2013668|doi=10.1177/053901847701600601}}</ref> While Bourdieu focuses on the diplomatic corps, it would be true if people want to be accepted in other contexts such as an urban ghetto. The market that one wants to engage with has a profound effect on the value of the variation of language they may use.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Woolard|first=Kathryn A.|date=1985|title=Language Variation and Cultural Hegemony: Toward an Integration of Sociolinguistic and Social Theory|journal=American Ethnologist|volume=12|issue=4|pages=738\u2013748|issn=0094-0496|jstor=644180|doi=10.1525/ae.1985.12.4.02a00090}}</ref> The relations of each gender to linguistic markets are different. A research on the pronunciation of English in Norwich has shown that women's usage is considerably more conservative regarding the standard variation of the language they speak.

It can be the standard one, or the polite version of it, or the so-called \"right\" one.<ref name=\":12\" />\n\n==Gender-specific vocabulary==\nSome natural languages have intricate systems of gender-specific [[vocabulary]].\n\n* [[Irish Sign Language]], due to single sex Deaf schools, developed separate male and female vocabularies which can still be seen today.\n*  It is speculated that [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] women had a special language called ''Emesal'', distinct from the main language, ''Emegir'', which was spoken by both genders. The women's language had a distinct vocabulary, found in the records of religious rituals to be performed by women, also in the speech of goddesses in mythological texts. There has been some dispute about the role of Emesal, with suggestions by some scholars that Emegir was a dialect used by the public and more informally while Emesal was a literary language.<ref>{{cite book | last = Whittaker | first = Gordon | chapter = Linguistic anthropology and the study of Emesal as (a) women's language | chapter-url = https://www.scribd.com/document/45691958/Whittaker-Linguistic-Anthropology-and-Emesal | editor-last1 = Parpola | editor-first1 = Simo | editor-last2 = Whiting | editor-first2 = Robert M. | title = Sex and gender in the ancient Near East: proceedings of the 47th Rencontre Assyriologique Internationale, Helsinki, July 2-6, 2001 | pages = 633&ndash;644 | publisher = Neo-Assyrian Text Corpus Project | location = Helsinki | year = 2002 | isbn = 9789514590542 }}</ref>\n* For a significant period of time in the history of the ancient [[languages of India]], after the formal language [[Sanskrit]] diverged from the popular [[Prakrit]] languages, some Sanskrit plays recorded the speech of women in Prakrit, distinct from the Sanskrit of male speakers.

When introducing him, Letterman would deliberately stumble over and mispronounce his last name (e.g., \"Hal Gurtner...Gurnter\"), or confuse him with [[Dan Gurney]] (e.g. \"Hal... our Emmy award winning director and legendary race car driver\").\n\nWhen Letterman moved to CBS in 1993, Gurnee followed Letterman to direct the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'', and remained its director and supervising producer from 1993 to 1995.\n\nGurnee also directed ''[[Tonight Starring Jack Paar|The Tonight Show]]'' during the [[Jack Paar]] era, along with Paar's later primetime show, ''The Jack Paar Program'', and directed episodes of ''[[The Man Show]].''\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDB name|0348668|Hal Gurnee}}\n\n{{EmmyAward VarietySeriesDirecting}}\n{{David Letterman}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Gurnee, Hal}}\n[[Category:American television directors]]\n[[Category:1935 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Television personalities from New York City]]\n", "name_user": "2601:240:106:274e:2d16:91c:605c:5acc", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eExternal links)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hal_Gurnee"}

Chemically, it is the ''N''-acetylated [[metabolite]] of [[procainamide]]. It is a Class III antiarrhythmic agent, whereas procainamide is a Class Ia antiarrhythmic drug. It is only partially as active as [[procainamide]]; when checking levels, both must be included in the final calculation.\n\n==History==\nIn the early 1930s, [[Claude Beck]] was undertaking pioneer cardiac surgery at the Lakeside Hospital in Cleveland, Ohio. During and after his surgery he was facing problems with [[arrhythmias]]. These problems were investigated by Frederick R. Mautz. In these experiments he used drugs similar to [[cocaine]], because these drugs were readily absorbed from [[mucous]] membranes and were also known to have some effect on the [[myocardium]]. Mautz tried procaine, but its action was short-lived owing to digestion by [[esterase]]s. From procaine Mautz synthesized procainamide, which is not a substrate for esterases. Procainamide has the additional advantage of being active by mouth. Procainamide was approved by the US FDA on June 2, 1950 under the brand name Pronestyl. In 1951 Pronestyl was launched by [[Bristol-Myers Squibb]], a pharmaceutical company in the US. Along with the discovery of procainamide came the discovery of its metabolite acecainide.<ref name=\"pmid18610401\">{{cite journal |author=Hollman A |title=Procaine and procainamide |journal=Br Heart J |volume=67 |issue=2 |pages=143 |date=February 1992 |pmid=18610401 |pmc=1024743 |doi= 10.1136/hrt.67.2.143|url=}}</ref>\n\n==Synthesis==\n[[Procainamide]] is metabolized in the liver to acecainide by [[N-acetyltransferase|''N''-acetyltransferase]], an enzyme that is genetically determined.<ref name=\"Nylen-1986\">{{Cite journal\n | pmid = 3484486\n| year = 1986\n| author1 = Nylen\n| first1 = E.

Measurements of procainamide in [[Serum (blood)|serum]] may not accurately reflect the drug's complete pharmacologic activity in the body.  Monitoring acecainide levels along with the procainamide is recommended during procainamide therapy.  Acecainide is considered comparable in activity to its parent compound; however, acecainide levels will vary widely.  Serum levels of acecainide increase in patients on chronic procainamide therapy, particularly in those with renal impairment.  The average serum concentration ratio of acecainide to procainamide is 0.8 to 1.2, depending on a genetically determined tendency to acetylate procainamide rapidly or slowly.  Because the ratio varies from patient to patient, measuring serum acecainide and procainamide together helps to achieve an optimum anti-arrhythmic effect and reduce the risk of toxicity.<ref name=\"Mulberg-1992\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Mulberg E, Dalton P, Hefner A | title=N-Acetylprocainamide Assay | journal=Clin Chem | year=1992 | volume=38 | issue=6 | pages=336}}</ref>\n\n===Mechanism===\nAcecainide is a potassium-channel blocker like Class III antiarrhythmic compounds.

Some acecainide can convert to procainamide. The deacetylation [[clearance (medicine)|clearance]] of acecainide is 0.39&nbsp;L/h compare to a total NAPA clearance of 1.38&nbsp;L/h, indicating that 2.8% of NAPA was converted to procainamide, 0.3% was [[desethylated]], and 10.3% convert to unidentified metabolites, with 86.6% excreted unchanged.

There is a linear relationship between acecainide clearance and creatinine clearance.<ref name=\"Kates-1982\"/>\n\nHowever, the clearance of acecainide was reduced in a few patients with cardiomyopathyand and [[ventricular arrhythmias]].

A reactive metabolite, possibly nitrosoprocainamide is thought to play a role in the [[lupus]] reaction. Acecainide, unlike procainamide, appears not to form a reactive metabolite.\n\nMean plasma elimination half-lives in healthy subjects range from 6.8 to 9.6 hours following single or repeated doses when sampling times of 12 to 24 hours are used. A tendency for prolongation of half-lives was noted in patients with cardiomyopathy and in patients with arrhythmias.<ref name=\"Harron-1990\"/>\n\n===Influence on clearance and concentration rate===\nSteady-state procainamide and acecainide concentrations were used to compute procainamide clearance and acecainide/procainamide (NAPA/PA) concentration ratio. Using stepwise multiple linear regression age, creatinine clearance and congestive heart failure were found to influence procainamide clearance significantly (p less than 0.05). Age and creatinine clearance effected the NAPA/PA concentration ratio (p less than 0.05). Based on this data, age appears to have an independent effect on both procainamide clearance and the NAPA/PA ratio that is separate from the decline in renal function that occurs in elderly patients.<ref name=\"Bauer-1989\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Bauer LA, Black D, Gensler A | title=Influence of age, renal function, and heart failure on procainamide clearance and n-acetylprocainamide serum concentrations | journal=Int J Clin Pharmacol There Tox | year=1989 | volume=27 | issue=5 | pages=213\u2013216}}</ref>\n\n==Administration==\nIt can be given either intravenously or orally, and is eliminated primarily by renal excretion. Comparative studies with other antiarrhythmic drugs have not been undertaken apart from a small study in atrial flutter where NAPA was better than quinidine plus digoxin. Although further clinical experience is required before the relative place of acecainide in therapy can be determined, the drug nevertheless appears to offer advantages over procainamide, particularly with respect to the reduced formation of antinuclear antibodies.\n\nThe dose of acecainide should be adjusted to control the patients\u2019 arrhythmias and with regard to their clinical state including age, renal function and concurrent administration of other drugs. There appears to be an overlap in plasma concentrations required for therapeutic efficacy and those associated with adverse effects. Rapid bolus infusion of acecainide has been associated with serious hypotension and a maximum infusion rate of 50&nbsp;mg/min has been suggested.<ref name=\"Harron-1990\"/>\n\n===Intravenous administration===\nIntravenous infusion of 0.45&nbsp;mg/kg/min for 30 minutes, followed by 0.22&nbsp;mg/ml/min for 30 minutes and a maintenance infusion, suppressed more than 90% of PVCs. Doses of acecainide 15 to 20&nbsp;mg/kg were also effective in preventing induced [[ventricular tachycardia]] or prolonging ventricular tachycardia cycle length and reducing frequency of PVCs. However, the dosage required to maintain antiarrhythmic effects is still not clear.<ref name=\"Harron-1990\"/>\n\n===Oral administration===\nIn short-term and more prolonged studies, acecainide 1.5 to 2.0&nbsp;g as a single dose or as three or four divided doses a day appears to be satisfactory in controlling PVCs. In patients who are refractory to other antiarrhythmic agents, the doses required appear to be greater. Moreover, a few studies inferred that tolerance may develop with long-term administration of NAPA, necessitating increased doses.\nThere are no specific dosage recommendations for patients with left ventricular dysfunction, although care should be taken to reduce the dose in patients with moderate to severe renal dysfunction.<ref name=\"Harron-1990\"/>\n\nThe loading dose of this medicine is 15\u201318&nbsp;mg/kg administered over 30 to 60 minutes for people without insufficient renal function or decreased cardiac output and 12&nbsp;mg/kg for people with this disorders. This can also be described by the formula of the loading dose:\n\nLD = Vss(l/kg) \u00d7 IBW(kg) \u00d7 Cp(mg/l) / ( S x F)\n\nThe daily empiric oral dose can be calculated by the next formula:\n\nDaily dose = (Css)ave \u00d7 Cl \u00d7 1440 / ( S x F )\n\nThis those is decreased by 25% in patients with heart and/or liver failures, and it is decreased by 50% by patients with renal failures.<ref name=\"Harron-1990\"/>\n\n==Drug interaction==\nResearch shows that accumulation of acecainide during procainamide therapy can alter both procainamide elimination as well as its electrophysiologic actions.<ref name=\"Funck\"/> A few healthy people demonstrated that [[concomitantly]] administered [[trimethoprim]] decreased the renal clearance of procainamide and formed NAPA, resulting in increased plasma concentrations of both drugs and increases in [[QTc]] after procainamide. [[Trimethoprim]], [[procainamide]] and acecainide are all excreted by active [[tubular secretion]]. \nAlso [[amiodarone]], [[cimetidine]] and [[trimethoprim]] increase the NAPA serum level.

Chemically, it is the ''N''-acetylated [[metabolite]] of [[procainamide]]. It is a Class III antiarrhythmic agent, whereas procainamide is a Class Ia antiarrhythmic drug. It is only partially as active as [[procainamide]]; when checking levels, both must be included in the final calculation.\n\n==History==\nIn the early 1930s, [[Claude Beck]] was undertaking pioneer cardiac surgery at the Lakeside Hospital in Cleveland, Ohio. During and after his surgery he was facing problems with [[arrhythmias]]. These problems were investigated by Frederick R. Mautz. In these experiments he used drugs similar to [[cocaine]], because these drugs were readily absorbed from [[mucous]] membranes and were also known to have some effect on the [[myocardium]]. Mautz tried procaine, but its action was short-lived owing to digestion by [[esterase]]s. From procaine Mautz synthesized procainamide, which is not a substrate for esterases. Procainamide has the additional advantage of being active by mouth. Procainamide was approved by the US FDA on June 2, 1950 under the brand name Pronestyl. In 1951 Pronestyl was launched by [[Bristol-Myers Squibb]], a pharmaceutical company in the US. Along with the discovery of procainamide came the discovery of its metabolite acecainide.<ref name=\"pmid18610401\">{{cite journal |author=Hollman A |title=Procaine and procainamide |journal=Br Heart J |volume=67 |issue=2 |pages=143 |date=February 1992 |pmid=18610401 |pmc=1024743 |doi= 10.1136/hrt.67.2.143|url=}}</ref>\n\n==Synthesis==\n[[Procainamide]] is metabolized in the liver to acecainide by [[N-acetyltransferase|''N''-acetyltransferase]], an enzyme that is genetically determined.<ref name=\"Nylen-1986\">{{Cite journal\n | pmid = 3484486\n| year = 1986\n| author1 = Nylen\n| first1 = E.

Measurements of procainamide in [[Serum (blood)|serum]] may not accurately reflect the drug's complete pharmacologic activity in the body.  Monitoring acecainide levels along with the procainamide is recommended during procainamide therapy.  Acecainide is considered comparable in activity to its parent compound; however, acecainide levels will vary widely.  Serum levels of acecainide increase in patients on chronic procainamide therapy, particularly in those with renal impairment.  The average serum concentration ratio of acecainide to procainamide is 0.8 to 1.2, depending on a genetically determined tendency to acetylate procainamide rapidly or slowly.  Because the ratio varies from patient to patient, measuring serum acecainide and procainamide together helps to achieve an optimum anti-arrhythmic effect and reduce the risk of toxicity.<ref name=\"Mulberg-1992\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Mulberg E, Dalton P, Hefner A | title=N-Acetylprocainamide Assay | journal=Clin Chem | year=1992 | volume=38 | issue=6 | pages=336}}</ref>\n\n===Mechanism===\nAcecainide is a potassium-channel blocker like Class III antiarrhythmic compounds.

At steady state, the volume of distribution is 1.3 to 1.7&nbsp;L/kg in healthy subjects, 1.3 to 1.58&nbsp;L/kg in patients with [[coronary artery disease]], and 1.25&nbsp;L/kg in patients with [[ventricular arrhythmias]] receiving acecainide therapy.<ref name=\"Harron-1990\"/>\n\nAcecainide has a volume of distribution of 1.5&nbsp;L/kg that is less than the Vd of procinamide (2.0&nbsp;L/kg). Also it binds 10% less to proteins than procainamide. Because of this low volume of distribution, it can be concluded that the medicine is thought to be confined in the plasma or liquid parts of the blood.<ref name=\"Descotes-1996\">{{cite book |editor-last=Descotes |editor-first=Jacques |date= 1996|title= Human Toxicology |url= |location= |publisher= Elsevier |pages= |isbn=978-0-444-81557-6|accessdate= }}</ref><ref name=\"Manuchair Ebad- 1997\">{{cite book |date= 1997|title= HCRC DESK Reference of clinical pharmacology|url= |location= |publisher= Elsevier |pages= |isbn=9780849396830|accessdate= }}</ref>\n\n===Metabolism and elimination===\nIn the body, acecainide is metabolised in several products. Some acecainide can convert to procainamide. The deacetylation [[clearance (medicine)|clearance]] of acecainide is 0.39&nbsp;L/h compare to a total NAPA clearance of 1.38&nbsp;L/h, indicating that 2.8% of NAPA was converted to procainamide, 0.3% was [[desethylated]], and 10.3% convert to unidentified metabolites, with 86.6% excreted unchanged. Following oral administration, 59 to 87% of a dose of acecainide is excreted unchanged in the urine.<ref name=\"Harron-1990\"/>\n\n[[File:schema NAPA2.png|thumb|left|510px|Reaction of acecainide]]{{clear left}}\n\n[[Renal clearance]] of acecainide following short and long term administration ranges from 2.08\u00b10.36&nbsp;mL/min/kg to 3.28\u00b10.52&nbsp;mL/min/kg in healthy people. There is a linear relationship between acecainide clearance and creatinine clearance.<ref name=\"Kates-1982\"/>\n\nHowever, the clearance of acecainide was reduced in a few patients with cardiomyopathyand and [[ventricular arrhythmias]]. Also is excretion of procainamide and NAPA is reduced in patients with [[Chronic kidney disease|CKD]].<ref name=\"Mohamed-2013\">{{cite journal |author= Mohamed, Ahmed N.| title= Pharmacokinetic modeling and simulation of procainamide and N-acetylprocainamide in a patient receiving continuous renal replacement therapy: a novel approach to guide renal dose adjustments.| journal= American Journal of Kidney Diseases | year=2013 | volume=61| issue=6 | pages=1046\u20131048 | pmid=23562328 | doi=10.1053/j.ajkd.2013.02.358|display-authors=etal | pmc=3851309}}</ref>\nA major reaction to procainamide and several other drugs is a syndrome that closely resembles [[lupus]]. A reactive metabolite, possibly nitrosoprocainamide is thought to play a role in the [[lupus]] reaction. Acecainide, unlike procainamide, appears not to form a reactive metabolite.\n\nMean plasma elimination half-lives in healthy subjects range from 6.8 to 9.6 hours following single or repeated doses when sampling times of 12 to 24 hours are used. A tendency for prolongation of half-lives was noted in patients with cardiomyopathy and in patients with arrhythmias.<ref name=\"Harron-1990\"/>\n\n===Influence on clearance and concentration rate===\nSteady-state procainamide and acecainide concentrations were used to compute procainamide clearance and acecainide/procainamide (NAPA/PA) concentration ratio. Using stepwise multiple linear regression age, creatinine clearance and congestive heart failure were found to influence procainamide clearance significantly (p less than 0.05). Age and creatinine clearance effected the NAPA/PA concentration ratio (p less than 0.05). Based on this data, age appears to have an independent effect on both procainamide clearance and the NAPA/PA ratio that is separate from the decline in renal function that occurs in elderly patients.<ref name=\"Bauer-1989\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Bauer LA, Black D, Gensler A | title=Influence of age, renal function, and heart failure on procainamide clearance and n-acetylprocainamide serum concentrations | journal=Int J Clin Pharmacol There Tox | year=1989 | volume=27 | issue=5 | pages=213\u2013216}}</ref>\n\n==Administration==\nIt can be given either intravenously or orally, and is eliminated primarily by renal excretion. Comparative studies with other antiarrhythmic drugs have not been undertaken apart from a small study in atrial flutter where NAPA was better than quinidine plus digoxin. Although further clinical experience is required before the relative place of acecainide in therapy can be determined, the drug nevertheless appears to offer advantages over procainamide, particularly with respect to the reduced formation of antinuclear antibodies.\n\nThe dose of acecainide should be adjusted to control the patients\u2019 arrhythmias and with regard to their clinical state including age, renal function and concurrent administration of other drugs. There appears to be an overlap in plasma concentrations required for therapeutic efficacy and those associated with adverse effects. Rapid bolus infusion of acecainide has been associated with serious hypotension and a maximum infusion rate of 50&nbsp;mg/min has been suggested.<ref name=\"Harron-1990\"/>\n\n===Intravenous administration===\nIntravenous infusion of 0.45&nbsp;mg/kg/min for 30 minutes, followed by 0.22&nbsp;mg/ml/min for 30 minutes and a maintenance infusion, suppressed more than 90% of PVCs. Doses of acecainide 15 to 20&nbsp;mg/kg were also effective in preventing induced [[ventricular tachycardia]] or prolonging ventricular tachycardia cycle length and reducing frequency of PVCs. However, the dosage required to maintain antiarrhythmic effects is still not clear.<ref name=\"Harron-1990\"/>\n\n===Oral administration===\nIn short-term and more prolonged studies, acecainide 1.5 to 2.0&nbsp;g as a single dose or as three or four divided doses a day appears to be satisfactory in controlling PVCs. In patients who are refractory to other antiarrhythmic agents, the doses required appear to be greater. Moreover, a few studies inferred that tolerance may develop with long-term administration of NAPA, necessitating increased doses.\nThere are no specific dosage recommendations for patients with left ventricular dysfunction, although care should be taken to reduce the dose in patients with moderate to severe renal dysfunction.<ref name=\"Harron-1990\"/>\n\nThe loading dose of this medicine is 15\u201318&nbsp;mg/kg administered over 30 to 60 minutes for people without insufficient renal function or decreased cardiac output and 12&nbsp;mg/kg for people with this disorders. This can also be described by the formula of the loading dose:\n\nLD = Vss(l/kg) \u00d7 IBW(kg) \u00d7 Cp(mg/l) / ( S x F)\n\nThe daily empiric oral dose can be calculated by the next formula:\n\nDaily dose = (Css)ave \u00d7 Cl \u00d7 1440 / ( S x F )\n\nThis those is decreased by 25% in patients with heart and/or liver failures, and it is decreased by 50% by patients with renal failures.<ref name=\"Harron-1990\"/>\n\n==Drug interaction==\nResearch shows that accumulation of acecainide during procainamide therapy can alter both procainamide elimination as well as its electrophysiologic actions.<ref name=\"Funck\"/> A few healthy people demonstrated that [[concomitantly]] administered [[trimethoprim]] decreased the renal clearance of procainamide and formed NAPA, resulting in increased plasma concentrations of both drugs and increases in [[QTc]] after procainamide. [[Trimethoprim]], [[procainamide]] and acecainide are all excreted by active [[tubular secretion]]. \nAlso [[amiodarone]], [[cimetidine]] and [[trimethoprim]] increase the NAPA serum level. [[Cimetidine]] and [[ranitidine]] possibly increase plasma procainamide and NAPA concentrations and subsequent toxicity.<ref name=\"Harron-1990\"/> Furthermore, alcohol enhances acetylation of procainamide to NAPA and alcohol consumption may reduce half-life.<ref name=\"Clin-1982\">{{Cite journal\n | pmid = 7059417\n| year = 1982\n| author1 = Olsen\n| first1 = H\n| title = Ethanol-induced increase in procainamide acetylation in man\n| journal = British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology\n| volume = 13\n| issue = 2\n| pages = 203\u20138\n| last2 = M\u00f8rland\n| first2 = J\n| pmc = 1402013\n | doi=10.1111/j.1365-2125.1982.tb01357.x\n}}</ref> It also has been shown that coadministration of para-aminobenzoic acid decreases the biotransformation of procainamide to acecainide in a patient with rapid acetylation kinetics.<ref name=\"Nylen-1986\"/>\n\n==Toxicity==\nMeasuring the ratio of acecainide and procainamide concentrations together helps to achieve an optimum anti-arrhythmic effect and reduce the risk of toxicity.<ref name=\"Mulberg-1992\"/>\n\n===Effects on humans===\nacecainide can cause cardiac toxicity that effects in [[torsades de pointes]]. Also acecainide can decrease renal function when it is accumulated during a procainamide therapy. Furthermore, acecainide can lead to a low blood pressure and a serious left ventricle depression when it is present in toxic concentrations.<ref name=\"Descotes-1996\"/>  Other common side effects of NAPA are gastrointestinal disturbances, insomnia, dizziness, lightheadedness, blurred vision, numbness and tingling sensation.<ref name=\"Manuchair Ebad- 1997\"/><ref name=\"Atkinson-1977\">{{Cite journal\n | pmid = 322922\n| year = 1977\n| author1 = Atkinson Jr\n| first1 = A.

However, he began contributing articles to the [[News Chronicle|News Chronicle]] at the same time, also writing short stories and channelling his love of the countryside into verse. <ref name=dnb>[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/31573Roger Lubbock, \u2018Pudney, John Sleigh (1909\u20131977)\u2019, rev.

During the 1930s he moved on from journalism and poetry to publishing novels and collections of short stories. However, it was the advent of the [[Second World War]] that enabled Pudney to find his subject - the effect that war has on the lives of ordinary people - and with it, his audience.<ref name=times>''The Times'' obituary, 11 November 1977, p 17</ref> In 1940 he was commissioned into the [[Royal Air Force]] as an intelligence officer and as a member of the [[Air Ministry]]'s Creative Writers Unit. It was while he was serving as squadron intelligence officer at [[RAF St Eval]] in Cornwall that Pudney wrote one of the best-known poems of the war.<ref name=dnb/> ''For Johnny'' evoked popular fellow-feeling in the London of 1941. Written during an air raid, it was published first in the ''News Chronicle'', and featured significantly in the film ''[[The Way to the Stars]]'':\n\n<poem>\nDo not despair\nFor Johnny-head-in-air;\nHe sleeps as sound\nAs Johnny underground.\n\nFetch out no shroud\nFor Johnny-in-the-cloud;\nAnd keep your tears\nFor him in after years.\n\nBetter by far\nFor Johnny-the-bright-star,\nTo keep your head,\nAnd see his children fed.\n</poem>\n\n==Later Career==\nIn the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|UK General Election of July 1945]], Pudney stood as the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] candidate for [[Sevenoaks (UK Parliament constituency)|Sevenoaks]], polling 14,947 votes, or 36 per cent.<ref>''The International Who's Who'' (Europa Publications Limited, 1963) p. 857</ref><ref>[http://www.psr.keele.ac.uk/area/uk/ge45/i17.htm UK General Election results July 1945] at keele.ac.uk, accessed 10 January 2009</ref>\n\nAfter the war he continued to write and worked as an editor and in publishing. He was with the ''[[News Review]]'' from 1948 to 1950, and as a director and literary adviser at the publishing houses Evans Brothers, Ltd (1950-1953) and Putnam & Co Ltd (1953-1963). In 1953 he wrote the documentary [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0238961/   ''Elizabeth is Queen''] for [[Associated British Picture Corporation|Associated British Path\u00e9]], which received a [[BAFTA]] award. His later poetry, from the collection ''Spill Out'' (1967), took on a more ironic stance, but still vernacular rather than academic. Of his novels, ''The Net'' (1952, set in an aeronautical research station) and ''Thin Air'' (1961) were well received.<ref name=times/> Between 1949 and 1963 he edited an annual anthology called ''Pick of Today's Short Stories''.\n\n==Private Life==\nOn 30 October 1934 Pudney married Crystal Selwyn Herbert, the daughter of [[A. P. Herbert]], the [[Independent (politician)|Independent]] [[Member of Parliament]]. They had two daughters and a son, but were divorced. In 1955 he married his second wife, Monica Forbes Curtis of the [[Forbes family]]. She helped him recover from his alcoholism, to which he publicly confessed in 1965 and emerged cured in 1967. That process became a subject for his writing. In 1976 he developed cancer of the throat from which he died a year later in much pain. He wrote about his illness unflinchingly in his autobiographical ''Thank Goodness for Cake'', posthumously published in 1978.<ref name=dnb/> His grandson [[Toby Perkins]] is the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Chesterfield]].\n\n==Works==\n\n===Poetry===\n*Spring Encounter (1933)\n*Open the Sky ([[Boriswood]] 1934)\n*Dispersal Point and other Air Poems (1942)\n*The Grass Grew All Round (1942)\n*Beyond This Disregard (1943) poems\n*South of Forty (1943) poems\n*Ten Summers: Poems 1933-1943 (1944)\n*Almanack of Hope: Sonnets (1944)\n*Air Force Poetry (1944) (anthology, edited with Henry Treese)\n*Flight above Cloud (1944)\n*World Still There (1945)\n*Selected Poems (1946)\n*Low Life (1947)\n*Commemorations (1948)\n*Collected Poems (1957)\n*Spill Out: Poems and Ballads (1967)\n*Spandrels : Poems and Ballads (1969)\n*Take This Orange: Poems and Ballads (1971)\n*Selected Poems 1967-1973 (1973)\n*Living in a One-Sided House (1976) poems\n*Writers' Workshop, poetry anthology publication, editor with [[Norman Hidden]] and [[Michael Johnson (editor)|Michael Johnson]] (from 1967)<ref>Durham University.

Industrial designer David Crafoord realised the sketches as a 1:5 scale model. This model was later scaled up in order to create the base plug for the initial Koenigsegg prototype that was finished in 1996. During the next years, the prototype went through extensive testing and several new prototypes were built. The prototypes initially used an Audi V8 engine but after the engine supply contract fell through, the next candidate was the [[Flat-12 engine|Flat-12]] race engine developed by [[Motori Moderni]] for the [[Scuderia Coloni#Coloni-Subaru (1990)|Scuderia Coloni]] Formula one team, in which this engine was raced under the Subaru badge in the [[1990 Formula One World Championship|1990 season]]. These [[Subaru 1235]] engines were purchased and modified for use in the CC; this deal failed when the founder of Motori Moderni died, sending the company into bankruptcy.<ref>{{Citation|last=DRIVETRIBE|title=How Koenigsegg nearly used a Subaru F1 engine in its supercars|date=2019-06-26|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tM_-u209ybs|access-date=2019-06-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=AMA1 With CvK - Early Years and Process |url=https://www.koenigsegg.com/ama1-with-cvk-early-years-and-process/ |website=Koenigsegg |access-date=2019-07-01 |date=2015-08-10}}</ref> Eventually Koenigsegg developed its own engine based on the Ford Modular architecture. Later on, Koenigsegg developed their own engines from scratch, including control systems and transmissions, which is very unusual for a small size Sportscar producer.\n\n===Factory history===\nChristian von Koenigsegg got the idea to build his own car after watching the Norwegian stop-motion animated movie ''[[Pinchcliffe Grand Prix]]'' in his youth.<ref name=\"Nettavisen1\">{{cite news |first=Jon Einar |last=Kolberg |url=http://www.nettavisen.no/bil/article515400.ece |title=Superbilen Koenigsegg blir norsk |trans-title=Supercar Koenigsegg becomes Norwegian |publisher=Nettavisen.no |language=Norwegian |date=2005-12-16 |accessdate=2009-06-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120225345/http://www.nettavisen.no/bil/article515400.ece |archive-date=2008-11-20 |url-status=dead }}</ref> He took his first steps in the world of business in his early 20s running a trading company called ''Alpraaz'' in [[Stockholm]], Sweden. Alpraaz exported food from Europe to the developing world. The success of this venture gave von Koenigsegg the necessary financial standing to launch his chosen career as a car manufacturer.\n\nInitially, Koenigsegg Automotive was based in [[Olofstr\u00f6m]]. In 1997, the company needed larger production facilities and moved to a farm, just outside \u00c4ngelholm. On 22 February 2003, one of the production facilities caught fire and was badly damaged. Koenigsegg then acquired an abandoned air field to use as his new factory building and in late 2003, one of the two large fighter-jet hangars and an office building were converted into a car factory. Since then, the company is located near the still-active \u00c4ngelholm airport, clients can arrive by private jet nearby. Koenigsegg controls and uses the former military runway for shakedown runs of production cars and high-speed testing.\n\nThe Koenigsegg badge was designed in 1994 by Jacob L\u00e5ftman, based on the heraldic coat of arms of the Koenigsegg family. The shield has been the family's [[coat of arms]] since the 12th century when a family member was knighted by the Germany-based [[Holy Roman Empire]].\n\n=== Ghost Badge ===\nAfter moving into the abandoned airfield, which once housed the Swedish air force's \"Johan R\u00f6d\" squadron, Koenigsegg adopted the \"ghost symbol\" that the squadron had on their planes, which were [[Saab 37 Viggen|Saab AJS37 Viggens]] aircraft (the squad also used the English phrase \"The show must go on\" on their aircraft as well) as a tribute to the squadron. The badge is seen on models built in the factory that was converted from their hangar, including the CCX, Agera, Agera R, One:1, and Regera.\n\n===Attempted purchase of Saab===\nOn 12 June 2009, the media reported that Koenigsegg Group, consisting of Koenigsegg Automotive AB, Christian von Koenigsegg, B\u00e5rd Eker and a group of investors led by Mark Bishop had signed a [[letter of intent]] with [[Saab Automobile|Saab]] to take over the brand from [[General Motors]].

[[Koenigsegg CC8S|CC8S]] in 2002 at the [[Geneva Auto Show]] and four more cars were built that year. Koenigsegg was established in Asia later that year with a premiere at the Seoul Auto Show.

This meant the car had to go through extensive development in order to meet the latest and most stringent safety and emission standards that the world's authorities demanded; Koenigsegg had to, for example, develop their own engines and other related technologies. Furthermore, Koenigsegg is the only low-volume sports car manufacturer to pass the new European pedestrian impact tests. Just after Koenigsegg passed this test, the requirement was deemed too complicated for compliance by low-volume manufacturers, so it is now unnecessary to meet these regulations if the production volume of a given model is less than 10,000 cars annually.\n\nIn 2007, Koenigsegg premiered the CCXR, a [[biofuel]]/[[Flexible-fuel vehicle|flex-fuel]] version of the CCX. The car features a modified engine, fuel system, and engine management system that enables the car to run on normal gasoline or ethanol, and in any mixture between these two fuels. Ethanol has a higher [[octane]] rating compared to regular fuel and has an internal cooling effect on the combustion chamber, which allows increased performance.\n\nIn 2009, Koenigsegg released information about a special edition car called the [[Koenigsegg Trevita|''Trevita'']], of which three were planned to be made but only two were finished due to technical problems. The ''Trevita'', which translates into English as \"three whites\", has a body made entirely of Koenigsegg's proprietary material consisting of diamond-coated carbon fibre. The ''Trevita'' is based on the CCXR, and therefore has a power output of {{Convert|1018|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} when running on biofuel.<ref name=\"Automoblog1\">{{citation|url=http://www.automoblog.net/2009/09/12/koenigsegg-trevita/|title=Koenigsegg Trevita - The Shimmering Diamond|publisher=Automoblog.net|date=2009-09-12}}</ref>\n{{Listen\n |filename     =Koenigsegg Agera.ogg\n |title        = Sound of Koenigsegg Agera\n |description  = The [[Koenigsegg Agera]] at [[Goodwood Festival of Speed]] 2010\n |type         =sound\n |style        =float:right;clear:none\n}}\n\nIn 2010 Koenigsegg released information at the 2010 Geneva Motor Show about a new model called the Agera, which translates into English as \"take action/act\".

Teaser sketches were released by the company at the same time. Initially, the model was rumoured to be called \"Ragnarok\" but the public unveil of the car at the 2019 Geneva Motor Show revealed the name to be Jesko, after the founder's father Jesko Von Koenigsegg.\nThe Jesko uses a development of the 5.0-litre V8 engine used in the Agera which has a power output of {{cvt|1280|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} on normal gasoline and has a power output of {{cvt|1600|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} and {{cvt|1160|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} of torque at 5,100 rpm on [[E85|E85 biofuel]]. The engine is mated to a 9-speed multi-clutch transmission having seven clutches called the light speed gearbox by the manufacturer. The focus of this transmission is to have faster shift times. The car will come in either in a low drag or a high drag variant with the low drag variant capable of achieving claimed speeds up to {{cvt|300|mph|kph|0|abbr=on|order=flip}}.\n\n=== List of models ===\n* [[Koenigsegg CC]] (1996) 1 prototype<ref>{{cite web|url= http://koenigsegg.com/cc-prototype/ |title= CC Prototype |publisher = Koenigsegg |accessdate=2015-07-14}}</ref>\n* [[Koenigsegg CC8S]] (2002\u20132004) 6 units (2 right hand drive) \u2013 0\u2013100&nbsp;km/h (0\u201362&nbsp;mph) under 3.5 sec.

Industrial designer David Crafoord realised the sketches as a 1:5 scale model. This model was later scaled up in order to create the base plug for the initial Koenigsegg prototype that was finished in 1996. During the next years, the prototype went through extensive testing and several new prototypes were built. The prototypes initially used an Audi V8 engine but after the engine supply contract fell through, the next candidate was the [[Flat-12 engine|Flat-12]] race engine developed by [[Motori Moderni]] for the [[Scuderia Coloni#Coloni-Subaru (1990)|Scuderia Coloni]] Formula one team, in which this engine was raced under the Subaru badge in the [[1990 Formula One World Championship|1990 season]]. These [[Subaru 1235]] engines were purchased and modified for use in the CC; this deal failed when the founder of Motori Moderni died, sending the company into bankruptcy.<ref>{{Citation|last=DRIVETRIBE|title=How Koenigsegg nearly used a Subaru F1 engine in its supercars|date=2019-06-26|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tM_-u209ybs|access-date=2019-06-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=AMA1 With CvK - Early Years and Process |url=https://www.koenigsegg.com/ama1-with-cvk-early-years-and-process/ |website=Koenigsegg |access-date=2019-07-01 |date=2015-08-10}}</ref> Eventually Koenigsegg developed its own engine based on the Ford Modular architecture. Later on, Koenigsegg developed their own engines from scratch, including control systems and transmissions, which is very unusual for a small size Sportscar producer.\n\n===Factory history===\nChristian von Koenigsegg got the idea to build his own car after watching the Norwegian stop-motion animated movie ''[[Pinchcliffe Grand Prix]]'' in his youth.<ref name=\"Nettavisen1\">{{cite news |first=Jon Einar |last=Kolberg |url=http://www.nettavisen.no/bil/article515400.ece |title=Superbilen Koenigsegg blir norsk |trans-title=Supercar Koenigsegg becomes Norwegian |publisher=Nettavisen.no |language=Norwegian |date=2005-12-16 |accessdate=2009-06-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120225345/http://www.nettavisen.no/bil/article515400.ece |archive-date=2008-11-20 |url-status=dead }}</ref> He took his first steps in the world of business in his early 20s running a trading company called ''Alpraaz'' in [[Stockholm]], Sweden. Alpraaz exported food from Europe to the developing world. The success of this venture gave von Koenigsegg the necessary financial standing to launch his chosen career as a car manufacturer.\n\nInitially, Koenigsegg Automotive was based in [[Olofstr\u00f6m]]. In 1997, the company needed larger production facilities and moved to a farm, just outside \u00c4ngelholm. On 22 February 2003, one of the production facilities caught fire and was badly damaged. Koenigsegg then acquired an abandoned air field to use as his new factory building and in late 2003, one of the two large fighter-jet hangars and an office building were converted into a car factory. Since then, the company is located near the still-active \u00c4ngelholm airport, clients can arrive by private jet nearby. Koenigsegg controls and uses the former military runway for shakedown runs of production cars and high-speed testing.\n\nThe Koenigsegg badge was designed in 1994 by Jacob L\u00e5ftman, based on the heraldic coat of arms of the Koenigsegg family. The shield has been the family's [[coat of arms]] since the 12th century when a family member was knighted by the Germany-based [[Holy Roman Empire]].\n\n=== Ghost Badge ===\nAfter moving into the abandoned airfield, which once housed the Swedish air force's \"Johan R\u00f6d\" squadron, Koenigsegg adopted the \"ghost symbol\" that the squadron had on their planes, which were [[Saab 37 Viggen|Saab AJS37 Viggens]] aircraft (the squad also used the English phrase \"The show must go on\" on their aircraft as well) as a tribute to the squadron. The badge is seen on models built in the factory that was converted from their hangar, including the CCX, Agera, Agera R, One:1, and Regera.\n\n===Attempted purchase of Saab===\nOn 12 June 2009, the media reported that Koenigsegg Group, consisting of Koenigsegg Automotive AB, Christian von Koenigsegg, B\u00e5rd Eker and a group of investors led by Mark Bishop had signed a [[letter of intent]] with [[Saab Automobile|Saab]] to take over the brand from [[General Motors]].

The first customer took delivery of a red [[Koenigsegg CC8S|CC8S]] in 2002 at the [[Geneva Auto Show]] and four more cars were built that year. Koenigsegg was established in Asia later that year with a premiere at the Seoul Auto Show. In 2004, the new [[Koenigsegg CCR|CCR]], which was basically a high performance variant of the CC8S, was unveiled at the Geneva Auto Show; only 14 were produced.\n\nIn 2006, Koenigsegg introduced the CCX, a new model, that was created in order to meet worldwide regulations for road use. This meant the car had to go through extensive development in order to meet the latest and most stringent safety and emission standards that the world's authorities demanded; Koenigsegg had to, for example, develop their own engines and other related technologies. Furthermore, Koenigsegg is the only low-volume sports car manufacturer to pass the new European pedestrian impact tests. Just after Koenigsegg passed this test, the requirement was deemed too complicated for compliance by low-volume manufacturers, so it is now unnecessary to meet these regulations if the production volume of a given model is less than 10,000 cars annually.\n\nIn 2007, Koenigsegg premiered the CCXR, a [[biofuel]]/[[Flexible-fuel vehicle|flex-fuel]] version of the CCX. The car features a modified engine, fuel system, and engine management system that enables the car to run on normal gasoline or ethanol, and in any mixture between these two fuels. Ethanol has a higher [[octane]] rating compared to regular fuel and has an internal cooling effect on the combustion chamber, which allows increased performance.\n\nIn 2009, Koenigsegg released information about a special edition car called the [[Koenigsegg Trevita|''Trevita'']], of which three were planned to be made but only two were finished due to technical problems. The ''Trevita'', which translates into English as \"three whites\", has a body made entirely of Koenigsegg's proprietary material consisting of diamond-coated carbon fibre. The ''Trevita'' is based on the CCXR, and therefore has a power output of {{Convert|1018|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} when running on biofuel.<ref name=\"Automoblog1\">{{citation|url=http://www.automoblog.net/2009/09/12/koenigsegg-trevita/|title=Koenigsegg Trevita - The Shimmering Diamond|publisher=Automoblog.net|date=2009-09-12}}</ref>\n{{Listen\n |filename     =Koenigsegg Agera.ogg\n |title        = Sound of Koenigsegg Agera\n |description  = The [[Koenigsegg Agera]] at [[Goodwood Festival of Speed]] 2010\n |type         =sound\n |style        =float:right;clear:none\n}}\n\nIn 2010 Koenigsegg released information at the 2010 Geneva Motor Show about a new model called the Agera, which translates into English as \"take action/act\".

The Agera's design follows a clear lineage from the previous Koenigsegg sports cars, but adds many special new features, such as a wider front track, new styling and aerodynamic features, and a new interior; including a new lighting technique called \"Ghost Light\" by the manufacturer which consists of microscopic holes to hide the interior lighting until it is turned on, which then shines through what appears to be solid aluminium.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.automoblog.net/2010/03/03/koenigsegg-agera-unleased-at-geneva/|title=Koenigsegg Agera Unleashed at Geneva| publisher=Automoblog.net|date=2010-03-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.koenigsegg.com/wp-content/uploads/Koenigsegg2012.pdf |title=Spirit of performance |publisher=koenigsegg.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120710042732/http://www.koenigsegg.com/wp-content/uploads/Koenigsegg2012.pdf |archive-date=2012-07-10 }}</ref> Production of the Agera ended in July 2018 after being in production for eight years when two of the three final edition cars were presented to their customers.\n\nAt the 2015 Geneva Motor Show, Koenigsegg presented a new model named the [[Koenigsegg Regera|''Regera'']], which translates into English as to \"reign\" or \"rule\".

Initially, the model was rumoured to be called \"Ragnarok\" but the public unveil of the car at the 2019 Geneva Motor Show revealed the name to be Jesko, after the founder's father Jesko Von Koenigsegg.\nThe Jesko uses a development of the 5.0-litre V8 engine used in the Agera which has a power output of {{cvt|1280|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} on normal gasoline and has a power output of {{cvt|1600|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} and {{cvt|1160|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} of torque at 5,100 rpm on [[E85|E85 biofuel]]. The engine is mated to a 9-speed multi-clutch transmission having seven clutches called the light speed gearbox by the manufacturer. The focus of this transmission is to have faster shift times.
