Her eldest surviving son, [[Thomas Adolphus Trollope]], wrote mostly histories: ''The Girlhood of [[Catherine de Medici]]'', ''History of Florence'', ''What I Remember'', ''Life of [[Pope Pius IX|Pius IX]]'', and some novels. Her fourth son [[Anthony Trollope]] became a well-known and received novelist, establishing a strong reputation, especially for his serial novels, such as those set in the fictional county of [[Barsetshire]], and his political series the [[Palliser novels]]. Despite producing six living children, their marriage was reputedly unhappy.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n====Move to America====\nSoon after the move to the leased farm, her marital and financial strains led Frances to seek companionship and aid from [[Frances Wright|Fanny Wright]], ward of the French hero [[Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette]]. In 1824 she visited La Grange, Lafayette's estate in France.<ref name=\"Penguin Putnam Inc\"/> Over the next three years, she made several other visits to France and was inspired to take an American excursion with Wright. Frances thought of America as a simple economic venture and figured that she could save money by sending her children through Wright's communal school, as Wright had planned to reform the education of African American children and the formerly enslaved on their property in Tennessee.<ref name=\"Bentley and Son\"/> In 1827, Frances Trollope took most of her family to [[Fanny Wright]]'s [[utopian]] community, [[Nashoba Commune]], in the United States. Her husband and remaining family followed shortly after.\n\nArriving in the United States four years earlier than her husband, she was able to develop an intimate relationship with [[Auguste Hervieu]], a collaborator in her venture, and moved to Cincinnati, Ohio with her sons after the community failed.<ref name=\"Penguin Putnam Inc\"/> She also encouraged the sculptor [[Hiram Powers]] to do [[Dante Alighieri]]'s ''[[Divine Comedy|Commedia]]'' in waxworks.{{sfn |Chisholm |1911}}\n\nNonetheless, all the ways she tried to support herself in America were unsuccessful. She found the cultural climate uninteresting and came to resent democracy. Furthermore, after her venture failed, her family was more in debt than when she had migrated there \u2013 forcing her and her family to move back to England in 1831.<ref name=\"Penguin Putnam Inc\"/>\n\n====Return to Europe====\nFrom her return at the age of 50 until her death, her need of an income for her family and escape her debts led her to begin writing novels, memoirs of her travels, and other shorter pieces, while travelling around Europe. She became well acquainted with elites and figures of Victorian literature including [[Elizabeth Barrett Browning|Elizabeth Barrett]], [[Robert Browning]], [[Charles Dickens]], [[Joseph Henry Green]] and R. W. Thackeray (a relative of [[William Makepeace Thackeray]]). She wrote 40 books: six travelogues, 35 novels, countless controversial articles, and poems. In 1843, Frances visited Italy and eventually moved to Florence permanently.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Pope-Hennessy |first1=Una |title=Three English Women in America |url=https://archive.org/details/threeenglishwome0000pope |url-access=registration |date=1929 |publisher=E.

Home to Fanny Trollope and her husband in 1836\u20131838]]\nTrollope already gained notice with her first book, ''[[Domestic Manners of the Americans]]'' (1832). She gave an unfavourable, and in the opinions of America's partisans, an exaggerated account.{{sfn |Chisholm |1911}} Her novel, ''The Refugee in America'' (1832), expressed similar views, prompting [[Catherine Maria Sedgwick]] to respond that \"Mrs. Trollope, though she has told some disagreeable truths, has for the most part caricatured till the resemblance is lost.\"<ref>Quoted in M. Sadleir, ''Trollope:  a commentary'' (London, 1945) p. 101.</ref> She was thought to reflect the disparaging views of American society that were allegedly commonplace at that time among English people of the higher social classes.\n\nLater Trollope wrote further travel works, such as ''Belgium and Western Germany in 1833'' (1834), ''Paris and the Parisians in 1835'' (1836), and ''Vienna and the Austrians'' (1838).<ref>''The Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature'', Volume 4; Volumes 1800\u20131900, Cambridge University Press, 2000.</ref> Among those with whom she became acquainted in Brussels was the future novelist [[Anna Harriett Drury]].\n\n===Novels===\nNext came ''The Abbess'' (1833), an [[anti-Catholic]] novel, as was ''Father Eustace'' (1847). While both borrowed from [[Female Gothic|Victorian Gothic]] conventions, the scholar Susan Griffin notes that Trollope wrote a Protestant critique of Catholicism that also expressed \"a gendered set of possibilities for self-making\", which has been little recognised by scholars. She noted that \"[[Modernism]]'s lingering legacy in criticism meant overlooking a woman's nineteenth century studies of religious controversy.\"<ref>[https://www.jstor.org/pss/25058624 Susan M.

It antagonizes pro-slavery characters, making them appear foolish and uncultured.

Other socially conscious novels of hers include ''The Vicar of Wrexhill'' (1837, Richard Bentley, London, 3 volumes), which took on the issue of corruption in the [[Church of England]] and evangelical circles. Possibly her greatest work is the ''Widow Barnaby'' trilogy (1839\u20131855), which includes the first ever sequel.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.litencyc.com/php/sworks.php?rec=true&UID=30663 |title=Literary Encyclopedia {{!}} The Widow Married; A Sequel to the Widow Barnaby |website=www.litencyc.com |language=en |access-date=2017-08-21}}</ref> In particular, [[Michael Sadleir]] considers the skilful set-up of ''Petticoat Government'' [1850], with its cathedral city, clerical psychology and domineering female, as something of a formative influence on her son's elaborate and colourful cast of characters in ''[[Barchester Towers]]'', notably [[Mrs Proudie]].<ref>M. Sadleir, ''Trollope'' (Constable 1945) p. 157.</ref>\n\n==Later life and death==\nIn later years Frances Trollope continued to write novels and books on miscellaneous subjects \u2013 in all over 100 volumes. In her own time, she was considered to have acute powers of observation and a sharp and caustic wit, but her prolific production coupled with the rise of modernist criticism caused her works to be overlooked in the 20th century. Few of her books are now read, but her first and two others are available on [[Project Gutenberg]].<ref>[https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/author/3479].</ref>\n\nAfter the death of her husband and daughter, in 1835 and 1838 respectively, Trollope relocated to [[Florence]], Italy, having lived briefly at [[Carleton, Eden]] in Cumbria, but finding that (in her son Tom's words) \"the sun yoked his horses too far from Penrith town.\"<ref>Quoted in G. Lindop, ''A Literary Guide to the Lake District'' (London 1993) p. 135.</ref> One year, she invited [[Theodosia Trollope|Theodosia Garrow]] to be her house guest.

Her eldest surviving son, [[Thomas Adolphus Trollope]], wrote mostly histories: ''The Girlhood of [[Catherine de Medici]]'', ''History of Florence'', ''What I Remember'', ''Life of [[Pope Pius IX|Pius IX]]'', and some novels. Her fourth son [[Anthony Trollope]] became a well-known and received novelist, establishing a strong reputation, especially for his serial novels, such as those set in the fictional county of [[Barsetshire]], and his political series the [[Palliser novels]]. Despite producing six living children, their marriage was reputedly unhappy.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n====Move to America====\nSoon after the move to the leased farm, her marital and financial strains led Frances to seek companionship and aid from [[Frances Wright|Fanny Wright]], ward of the French hero [[Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette]]. In 1824 she visited La Grange, Lafayette's estate in France.<ref name=\"Penguin Putnam Inc\"/> Over the next three years, she made several other visits to France and was inspired to take an American excursion with Wright. Frances thought of America as a simple economic venture and figured that she could save money by sending her children through Wright's communal school, as Wright had planned to reform the education of African American children and the formerly enslaved on their property in Tennessee.<ref name=\"Bentley and Son\"/> In 1827, Frances Trollope took most of her family to [[Fanny Wright]]'s [[utopian]] community, [[Nashoba Commune]], in the United States. Her husband and remaining family followed shortly after.\n\nArriving in the United States four years earlier than her husband, she was able to develop an intimate relationship with [[Auguste Hervieu]], a collaborator in her venture, and moved to Cincinnati, Ohio with her sons after the community failed.<ref name=\"Penguin Putnam Inc\"/> She also encouraged the sculptor [[Hiram Powers]] to do [[Dante Alighieri]]'s ''[[Divine Comedy|Commedia]]'' in waxworks.{{sfn |Chisholm |1911}}\n\nNonetheless, all the ways she tried to support herself in America were unsuccessful. She found the cultural climate uninteresting and came to resent democracy. Furthermore, after her venture failed, her family was more in debt than when she had migrated there \u2013 forcing her and her family to move back to England in 1831.<ref name=\"Penguin Putnam Inc\"/>\n\n====Return to Europe====\nFrom her return at the age of 50 until her death, her need of an income for her family and escape her debts led her to begin writing novels, memoirs of her travels, and other shorter pieces, while travelling around Europe. She became well acquainted with elites and figures of Victorian literature including [[Elizabeth Barrett Browning|Elizabeth Barrett]], [[Robert Browning]], [[Charles Dickens]], [[Joseph Henry Green]] and R. W. Thackeray (a relative of [[William Makepeace Thackeray]]). She wrote 40 books: six travelogues, 35 novels, countless controversial articles, and poems. In 1843, Frances visited Italy and eventually moved to Florence permanently.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Pope-Hennessy |first1=Una |title=Three English Women in America |url=https://archive.org/details/threeenglishwome0000pope |url-access=registration |date=1929 |publisher=E.

Home to Fanny Trollope and her husband in 1836\u20131838]]\nTrollope already gained notice with her first book, ''[[Domestic Manners of the Americans]]'' (1832). She gave an unfavourable, and in the opinions of America's partisans, an exaggerated account.{{sfn |Chisholm |1911}} Her novel, ''The Refugee in America'' (1832), expressed similar views, prompting [[Catherine Maria Sedgwick]] to respond that \"Mrs. Trollope, though she has told some disagreeable truths, has for the most part caricatured till the resemblance is lost.\"<ref>Quoted in M. Sadleir, ''Trollope:  a commentary'' (London, 1945) p. 101.</ref> She was thought to reflect the disparaging views of American society that were allegedly commonplace at that time among English people of the higher social classes.\n\nLater Trollope wrote further travel works, such as ''Belgium and Western Germany in 1833'' (1834), ''Paris and the Parisians in 1835'' (1836), and ''Vienna and the Austrians'' (1838).<ref>''The Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature'', Volume 4; Volumes 1800\u20131900, Cambridge University Press, 2000.</ref> Among those with whom she became acquainted in Brussels was the future novelist [[Anna Harriett Drury]].\n\n===Novels===\nNext came ''The Abbess'' (1833), an [[anti-Catholic]] novel, as was ''Father Eustace'' (1847). While both borrowed from [[Female Gothic|Victorian Gothic]] conventions, the scholar Susan Griffin notes that Trollope wrote a Protestant critique of Catholicism that also expressed \"a gendered set of possibilities for self-making\", which has been little recognised by scholars. She noted that \"[[Modernism]]'s lingering legacy in criticism meant overlooking a woman's nineteenth century studies of religious controversy.\"<ref>[https://www.jstor.org/pss/25058624 Susan M.

Other socially conscious novels of hers include ''The Vicar of Wrexhill'' (1837, Richard Bentley, London, 3 volumes), which took on the issue of corruption in the [[Church of England]] and evangelical circles. Possibly her greatest work is the ''Widow Barnaby'' trilogy (1839\u20131855), which includes the first ever sequel.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.litencyc.com/php/sworks.php?rec=true&UID=30663 |title=Literary Encyclopedia {{!}} The Widow Married; A Sequel to the Widow Barnaby |website=www.litencyc.com |language=en |access-date=2017-08-21}}</ref> In particular, [[Michael Sadleir]] considers the skilful set-up of ''Petticoat Government'' [1850], with its cathedral city, clerical psychology and domineering female, as something of a formative influence on her son's elaborate and colourful cast of characters in ''[[Barchester Towers]]'', notably [[Mrs Proudie]].<ref>M.

In her own time, she was considered to have acute powers of observation and a sharp and caustic wit, but her prolific production coupled with the rise of modernist criticism caused her works to be overlooked in the 20th century. Few of her books are now read, but her first and two others are available on [[Project Gutenberg]].<ref>[https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/author/3479].</ref>\n\nAfter the death of her husband and daughter, in 1835 and 1838 respectively, Trollope relocated to [[Florence]], Italy, having lived briefly at [[Carleton, Eden]] in Cumbria, but finding that (in her son Tom's words) \"the sun yoked his horses too far from Penrith town.\"<ref>Quoted in G.
