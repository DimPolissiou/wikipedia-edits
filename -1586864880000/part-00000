There are many different shapes and models of vibrators. Some vibrators designed for women stimulate both the clitoris and the vagina, while others are designed for couples to stimulate the genitals of both partners.\n\n==Types==\n[[File:Hitachi-magic-wand.jpg|thumb|Hitachi Magic Wand]]\n[[File:Techo Rabbit.jpg|thumb|Techno Rabbit Vibrator]]\n[[File:MysteryVibe Crescendo.png|alt=Bendable Vibrator|thumb|Bendable Vibrator]]\n[[File:Designvibratoren.jpg|thumb|Designer vibrators]]\n[[File:Pocket Rocket.jpg|thumb|55px|A 'pocket rocket' type vibrator]]\n\nVibrators very often generate their vibrations using eccentric weights driven by a conventional [[electric motor]], but some use electromagnet coils.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sextoys411.com/diffrent_kinds_of_vibrators.htm|title=Vibrators - Different Kinds|website=www.sextoys411.com|accessdate=24 September 2018}}</ref> Some vibrators are marketed as \"body massagers\"\u2014although they still may be used, like the ones sold as adult sex toys, for [[autoeroticism]]. Some vibrators run on batteries while others have a power cord that plugs into a wall socket. There is also a vibrator that uses the flow of air from a vacuum cleaner to stimulate the clitoris. Modern versions of old musical vibrators synchronize the vibrations to music from a [[MP3 player|music player]] or a [[mobile phone|cell phone]]. Some luxury brand vibrators are also completely covered in medical grade silicone with no exposed control panels or seams. Although proper cleaning is required for any sex toy, having fewer places for bacteria to grow reduces the chance of infection.\n\nWhile some companies sell significantly larger dildos and vibrators, most that are marketed for vaginal or anal insertion are sized around the [[Human penis size|average penis size]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Herbenick|first1=Debby|last2=Barnhart|first2=Kathryn J.|last3=Beavers|first3=Karly|last4=Benge|first4=Stephanie|title=Vibrators and Other Sex Toys are Commonly Recommended to Patients, But Does Size Matter?

A dual type of vibrator provides stimulation to both clitoris and [[G-spot]]. They are normally driven by batteries and some of them can be used underwater. The most common type of clitoral vibrator is small, egg-shaped and attached to a multi-speed battery pack by a long cord. Variations include vibrators shaped like narrow bullets, animals, ergonomic forms, miniature rockets and large human tongues. Regardless of the design, the main function of the clitoral vibrator is to vibrate at varying speeds and intensities. Some clitoral vibrators may be inserted into the vagina. These typically have a small arm near the base of the vibrator, providing simultaneous clitoral and vaginal stimulation.\n\n* [[Dildo]]-shaped: these approximate a penis shape and size, and can be made of plastic, silicone, rubber, vinyl, or latex. Vibrating dildos can be for personal use or by a partner. They may be used for vaginal and [[anal penetration]], as well as for oral penetration.<ref name=\"Mikayla\">{{cite web|url=https://www.tootimid.com/Best-Vibrators-For-Oral-Sex-Enhancement-b-691.html |title=Vibrators for Oral Sex| publisher= Tootimid}} </ref> They come in different sizes, colors and textures, and they may be double-ended, so that both anal and vaginal stimulation can be performed at the same time.\n\n* [[Love egg|Egg or bullet vibrators]]: an egg- or bullet-shaped vibrator for clitoral or penile stimulation and vaginal or anal insertion. Wired and wireless variants are both common.\n\n* Waterproof: these can be used wet, such as in the shower. Although marketed as waterproof, most should not be submerged. The ones designed for underwater use may be used in the swimming pool, bath or shower, or any other wet place. These vibrators are recommended to be used with a water compatible [[lubricant]], such as silicone-based lubricant.\n\n* [[Rabbit vibrator|Rabbit]], Two-pronged for stimulation of both the [[vagina]] and the [[clitoris]] simultaneously.

A phallus-like shaped vibrator is intended to be inserted into the vagina to stimulate the vagina, while a smaller clitoral stimulator is placed facing forward onto the main vibrator. The rabbit vibrator was named after the shape of the clitoral stimulator, which resembles a pair of rabbit ears. They are normally made of [[rubber]], [[Gelatin|jelly]], [[silicone]], or latex and they come in a wide variety of colors, sizes and designs.\n\n* [[G-spot vibrator|G-spot]]: Similar to the traditional vibrator but with a curve and often a soft jelly-like coating. The curve is designed to stimulate the g-spot or [[prostate]]. This type of vibrator is made of materials such as silicone or [[Acrylate polymer|acrylic]]. It can be used with or without the vibrations. They are recommended to be used with a significant amount of lubricant, especially when used anally.\n\n* Bendable vibrators: these bend to varying degrees to adapt to the body shape, and used to find and stimulate hard-to-reach erogenous zones. Can be shaped to act as various types of vibrators like g-spot, anal, penis, dual, etc.\n\n* Programmable and remote-control vibrators: these can be worn in or against the genitals that can be pre-programmed or controlled remotely. For example, \"Little Rooster\" is a timer which is intended to wake the user by vibrating at first gently and then with increasing power.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/11/23/trade_show_review/ |title=Erotica 2011 stands firm against rise of the sex machines |date=November 23, 2011 |publisher=The Register |author=Jane Fae Ozimek}}</ref> Other vibrators come with a handheld remote, available in both wired and cordless, that can be used to adjust speed and intensity.\n\n* Pocket rocket vibrators: these are shaped like a cylinder, with one of its ends having some vibrating bulges. It is meant to stimulate the clitoris or nipples, not for vaginal insertion. A pocket rocket is a mini-vibrator that is typically about five inches long and which resembles a small, travel-sized flashlight. These are described as discreet sex toys that may be carried around in one's purse or briefcase, but is not one of the most silent vibrators. Many users claim that it is quite noisy. Due to its small dimension, it is powered by a single battery, and usually has only one speed.\n\n* \"Undercover\" vibrators: Vibrators discreetly shaped as everyday objects, such as lipstick tubes, cell phones, or art pieces. Occasionally some women use actual mobile phones in this function. This type of vibrator is made of a wide range of materials, shapes and colors. The undercover vibrators are usually relatively small enough and most of the time they have only one speed and are powered by a single battery. They tend to copy an exact shape and design of the object they are intended to be mistaken as.\n* [[Anal vibrator]]s: these are designed for anal use and have either a flared base or a long handle to grip, to prevent them from slipping inside and becoming lodged in the rectum. Anal vibrators come in different shapes but they are commonly butt plugs or phallus-like vibrators. They are recommended to be used with a significant amount of lubricant and to be inserted gently and carefully to prevent any potential damage to the rectal lining.\n\n* \"[[Butterfly vibrator|Butterfly]]\": Vibrator strapped around legs and waist for hands-free clitoral stimulation during sexual intercourse. It comes in three variations: traditional, [[remote control]], and with anal or vaginal stimulators. They are made of silicone, plastic and latex, or jelly.\n\n* Vibrating cockring: Vibrator (usually cordless) inserted in or attached to a [[cock ring]], usually for stimulation of the clitoris. This is actually a part of a \"cock ring\" which is attached to the penis to enhance clitoral stimulation during sexual intercourse.\n\n* Dual area vibrators: These vibrators are designed to stimulate two erogenous zones simultaneously or independently. They are usually found in the form of a clitoral stimulator and vaginal stimulator; an example is the [[Sybian]]. For men, there are vibrators which stimulate the prostate and perineum at the same time.\n\n* Triple area vibrators: These vibrators are designed to stimulate three erogenous zones simultaneously or independently. These provide stimulation to the vagina, clitoris and anal regions, in women. The designs for men stimulate the anus, perineum and scrotum.\n\n* Multispeed vibrators: these allow users to customize how fast the vibrator's pulsing or massaging movements occur. Depending on the specific type of vibrator, the [[speed]] change is made by simply pushing a button a certain number of times, allowing users to change speeds several times during use.\n\n* Smart vibrators: these use [[Bluetooth]] connections to allow for remote control over the internet, vibration in-sync with multimedia content, programmable vibrations, and similar via mobile applications.\n\n==Vibrators for disabled people==\n[[Disabled]] people can find that vibrators are an essential part of their sex life for two reasons: First, it might be the only way to get sexual satisfaction due to impaired arm and hand function.<ref name=\"gr\">[http://www.disabled.gr/lib/?p=10492 Disabled.gr] <!--this source is very poor and should be replaced with an academic reference asap-->{{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/5vyu73TpB?url=http://www.disabled.gr/lib/?p%3D10492 |date=24 January 2011 }}</ref> Second, for some disabled men, the use of a vibrator is their only way to provide a semen sample for [[in-vitro fertilization]].<ref name=gr/>\n\n==History==\n\n===Early development===\nThe electric vibrator was invented in the late 19th century as a medical instrument for pain relief and the treatment of various ailments; one account gives its first use at the [[Piti\u00e9-Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re Hospital|Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re hospital]] in Paris in 1878, with Romain Vigouroux cited as the inventor. English physician and inventor [[Joseph Mortimer Granville]], who also developed an early model, asserted his own priority in the invention and has been described as the 'father of the modern electromechanical vibrator'.{{sfn|Maines|1999|p=91-94}} Mortimer Granville's 1883 book ''Nerve-vibration and excitation as agents in the treatment of functional disorder and organic disease'' describes the intended use of his vibrator for purposes including pain relief and the treatment of [[neuralgia]], [[neurasthenia]], morbid irritability, indigestion and constipation.<ref>{{cite book| last=Mortimer Granville| first=Joseph| title=Nerve-vibration and excitation as agents in the treatment of functional disorder and organic disease| date=1883| publisher=J. & A. Churchill |url=https://archive.org/details/nervevibrationex00gran}}</ref> These early vibrators became popular among the medical profession and were used for treating a wide variety of ailments in women and men including [[hysteria]], [[arthritis]], [[constipation]], amenorrhea, inflammations, and [[Tumor|tumors]]; some wounded World War I soldiers received vibrotherapy as treatment at English and French hospitals in Serbia.{{sfn|Maines|1999|p=94}}\n\n[[File:White Cross Electric Vibrator ad NYT 1913.jpg|thumb|upright|1913 advertisement]]\nVibrators began to be marketed for home use in magazines from around 1900 together with other electrical household goods, for their supposed health and beauty benefits. An early example was the 'Vibratile,' an advert which appeared in [[McClure's]] magazine in March 1899, offered as a cure for 'Neuralgia, Headache, Wrinkles'. These advertisements disappeared in the 1920s, possibly because of their appearance in [[pornography]], and because growing understanding of female sexual function made it no longer tenable for mainstream society to avoid the sexual connotations of the devices.{{sfn|Maines|1999|p=104-109}}\n\n====Conjectured early use for female sexual stimulation====\n[[File:Sears - Aids That Every Woman Appreciates.jpg|thumb|300px|Sears, Roebuck and Company catalog, 1918]]\nHistorian of technology [[Rachel Maines]], in her book ''The Technology of Orgasm'',{{sfn|Maines|1999}} has argued that the development of the vibrator in the late 19th century was in large part due to the requirements of doctors for an easier way to perform genital massage on women, often to 'hysterical paroxysm' ([[orgasm]]), which was historically a treatment for the once common medical diagnosis of [[female hysteria]]. Maines writes that this treatment had been recommended since classical antiquity in Europe, including in the [[Hippocratic corpus]] and by [[Galen]], and continued to be used into the medieval and modern periods,{{sfn|Maines|1999|p=23-24}} but was not seen as sexual by physicians due to the absence of penetration,{{sfn|Maines|1999|p=10}} and was viewed by them as a difficult and tedious task.{{sfn|Maines|1999|p=67-68}} Maines writes that the first use of the vibrator at the Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re was on hysterical women, but notes that Joseph Mortimer Granville denied that he had, or ever would have, used his invention for this purpose;{{sfn|Maines|1999|p=94}} additionally, Maines states that the true use of these medical vibrators, and the vibrators marketed for home use in the early 20th century, was not openly stated, but proceeded under 'social camouflage'.{{sfn|Maines|1999|p=20}} One example of suggestive advertising given is a 1908 advert in ''National Home Journal'' for the Bebout hand-powered mechanical vibrator, containing the text \"Gentle, soothing, invigorating and refreshing. Invented by a woman who knows a woman's needs.\"{{sfn|Maines|1999|p=100}}\n\nOther historians disagree with Maines about the historical prevalence of genital massage as a treatment for female hysteria, and over the extent to which early vibrating massagers were used for this purpose. The idea that stimulation to orgasm was a standard treatment for female hysteria in ancient and medieval Europe has been disputed on the grounds of being a distortion of the sources,<ref>{{cite journal |last=King |first=Helen |date=2011 |title=Galen and the widow: towards a history of therapeutic masturbation in ancient gynaecology |url=http://eugesta.recherche.univ-lille3.fr/revue/pdf/2011/King.pdf |journal=EuGeStA: Journal on Gender Studies in Antiquity |volume=1 |pages=205\u2013235 }}</ref> and cases of this treatment in the 19th and early 20th centuries, and of the use of early vibrators to perform it, have been described as a practice that, if it occurred at all, would have been confined to an extremely limited group.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lesleyahall.net/factoids.htm#hysteria |title=Doctors masturbating women as a cure for hysteria/'Victorian vibrators' |last=Hall |first=Lesley|website=lesleyahall.net|accessdate=29 October 2016}}</ref> Maines has said her widely reported theory should be treated as a hypothesis rather than a fact.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bigthink.com/videos/big-think-interview-with-rachel-maines |title=Big Think Interview With Rachel Maines |last=Maines|first=Rachel|website=bigthink.com |accessdate=16 November 2016}}</ref> In 2018, [[Hallie Lieberman]] and Eric Schatzberg published a peer-reviewed article that found \"no evidence\" to support Maines's claims in the book's citations.

Modern versions of old musical vibrators synchronize the vibrations to music from a [[MP3 player|music player]] or a [[mobile phone|cell phone]]. Some luxury brand vibrators are also completely covered in medical grade silicone with no exposed control panels or seams.

A dual type of vibrator provides stimulation to both clitoris and [[G-spot]]. They are normally driven by batteries and some of them can be used underwater. The most common type of clitoral vibrator is small, egg-shaped and attached to a multi-speed battery pack by a long cord. Variations include vibrators shaped like narrow bullets, animals, ergonomic forms, miniature rockets and large human tongues. Regardless of the design, the main function of the clitoral vibrator is to vibrate at varying speeds and intensities. Some clitoral vibrators may be inserted into the vagina. These typically have a small arm near the base of the vibrator, providing simultaneous clitoral and vaginal stimulation.\n\n* [[Dildo]]-shaped: these approximate a penis shape and size, and can be made of plastic, silicone, rubber, vinyl, or latex. Vibrating dildos can be for personal use or by a partner. They may be used for vaginal and [[anal penetration]], as well as for oral penetration.<ref name=\"Mikayla\">{{cite web|url=https://www.tootimid.com/Best-Vibrators-For-Oral-Sex-Enhancement-b-691.html |title=Vibrators for Oral Sex| publisher= Tootimid}} </ref> They come in different sizes, colors and textures, and they may be double-ended, so that both anal and vaginal stimulation can be performed at the same time.\n\n* [[Love egg|Egg or bullet vibrators]]: an egg- or bullet-shaped vibrator for clitoral or penile stimulation and vaginal or anal insertion. Wired and wireless variants are both common.\n\n* Waterproof: these can be used wet, such as in the shower. Although marketed as waterproof, most should not be submerged. The ones designed for underwater use may be used in the swimming pool, bath or shower, or any other wet place. These vibrators are recommended to be used with a water compatible [[lubricant]], such as silicone-based lubricant.\n\n* [[Rabbit vibrator|Rabbit]], Two-pronged for stimulation of both the [[vagina]] and the [[clitoris]] simultaneously.

A phallus-like shaped vibrator is intended to be inserted into the vagina to stimulate the vagina, while a smaller clitoral stimulator is placed facing forward onto the main vibrator. The rabbit vibrator was named after the shape of the clitoral stimulator, which resembles a pair of rabbit ears. They are normally made of [[rubber]], [[Gelatin|jelly]], [[silicone]], or latex and they come in a wide variety of colors, sizes and designs.\n\n* [[G-spot vibrator|G-spot]]: Similar to the traditional vibrator but with a curve and often a soft jelly-like coating. The curve is designed to stimulate the g-spot or [[prostate]]. This type of vibrator is made of materials such as silicone or [[Acrylate polymer|acrylic]]. It can be used with or without the vibrations. They are recommended to be used with a significant amount of lubricant, especially when used anally.\n\n* Bendable vibrators: these bend to varying degrees to adapt to the body shape, and used to find and stimulate hard-to-reach erogenous zones. Can be shaped to act as various types of vibrators like g-spot, anal, penis, dual, etc.\n\n* Programmable and remote-control vibrators: these can be worn in or against the genitals that can be pre-programmed or controlled remotely. For example, \"Little Rooster\" is a timer which is intended to wake the user by vibrating at first gently and then with increasing power.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/11/23/trade_show_review/ |title=Erotica 2011 stands firm against rise of the sex machines |date=November 23, 2011 |publisher=The Register |author=Jane Fae Ozimek}}</ref> Other vibrators come with a handheld remote, available in both wired and cordless, that can be used to adjust speed and intensity.\n\n* Pocket rocket vibrators: these are shaped like a cylinder, with one of its ends having some vibrating bulges. It is meant to stimulate the clitoris or nipples, not for vaginal insertion. A pocket rocket is a mini-vibrator that is typically about five inches long and which resembles a small, travel-sized flashlight. These are described as discreet sex toys that may be carried around in one's purse or briefcase, but is not one of the most silent vibrators. Many users claim that it is quite noisy. Due to its small dimension, it is powered by a single battery, and usually has only one speed.\n\n* \"Undercover\" vibrators: Vibrators discreetly shaped as everyday objects, such as lipstick tubes, cell phones, or art pieces. Occasionally some women use actual mobile phones in this function. This type of vibrator is made of a wide range of materials, shapes and colors. The undercover vibrators are usually relatively small enough and most of the time they have only one speed and are powered by a single battery. They tend to copy an exact shape and design of the object they are intended to be mistaken as.\n* [[Anal vibrator]]s: these are designed for anal use and have either a flared base or a long handle to grip, to prevent them from slipping inside and becoming lodged in the rectum. Anal vibrators come in different shapes but they are commonly butt plugs or phallus-like vibrators. They are recommended to be used with a significant amount of lubricant and to be inserted gently and carefully to prevent any potential damage to the rectal lining.\n\n* \"[[Butterfly vibrator|Butterfly]]\": Vibrator strapped around legs and waist for hands-free clitoral stimulation during sexual intercourse. It comes in three variations: traditional, [[remote control]], and with anal or vaginal stimulators. They are made of silicone, plastic and latex, or jelly.\n\n* Vibrating cockring: Vibrator (usually cordless) inserted in or attached to a [[cock ring]], usually for stimulation of the clitoris. This is actually a part of a \"cock ring\" which is attached to the penis to enhance clitoral stimulation during sexual intercourse.\n\n* Dual area vibrators: These vibrators are designed to stimulate two erogenous zones simultaneously or independently. They are usually found in the form of a clitoral stimulator and vaginal stimulator; an example is the [[Sybian]]. For men, there are vibrators which stimulate the prostate and perineum at the same time.\n\n* Triple area vibrators: These vibrators are designed to stimulate three erogenous zones simultaneously or independently. These provide stimulation to the vagina, clitoris and anal regions, in women. The designs for men stimulate the anus, perineum and scrotum.\n\n* Multispeed vibrators: these allow users to customize how fast the vibrator's pulsing or massaging movements occur. Depending on the specific type of vibrator, the [[speed]] change is made by simply pushing a button a certain number of times, allowing users to change speeds several times during use.\n\n* Smart vibrators: these use [[Bluetooth]] connections to allow for remote control over the internet, vibration in-sync with multimedia content, programmable vibrations, and similar via mobile applications.\n\n==Vibrators for disabled people==\n[[Disabled]] people can find that vibrators are an essential part of their sex life for two reasons: First, it might be the only way to get sexual satisfaction due to impaired arm and hand function.<ref name=\"gr\">[http://www.disabled.gr/lib/?p=10492 Disabled.gr] <!--this source is very poor and should be replaced with an academic reference asap-->{{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/5vyu73TpB?url=http://www.disabled.gr/lib/?p%3D10492 |date=24 January 2011 }}</ref> Second, for some disabled men, the use of a vibrator is their only way to provide a semen sample for [[in-vitro fertilization]].<ref name=gr/>\n\n==History==\n\n===Early development===\nThe electric vibrator was invented in the late 19th century as a medical instrument for pain relief and the treatment of various ailments; one account gives its first use at the [[Piti\u00e9-Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re Hospital|Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re hospital]] in Paris in 1878, with Romain Vigouroux cited as the inventor. English physician and inventor [[Joseph Mortimer Granville]], who also developed an early model, asserted his own priority in the invention and has been described as the 'father of the modern electromechanical vibrator'.{{sfn|Maines|1999|p=91-94}} Mortimer Granville's 1883 book ''Nerve-vibration and excitation as agents in the treatment of functional disorder and organic disease'' describes the intended use of his vibrator for purposes including pain relief and the treatment of [[neuralgia]], [[neurasthenia]], morbid irritability, indigestion and constipation.<ref>{{cite book| last=Mortimer Granville| first=Joseph| title=Nerve-vibration and excitation as agents in the treatment of functional disorder and organic disease| date=1883| publisher=J. & A.

An early example was the 'Vibratile,' an advert which appeared in [[McClure's]] magazine in March 1899, offered as a cure for 'Neuralgia, Headache, Wrinkles'. These advertisements disappeared in the 1920s, possibly because of their appearance in [[pornography]], and because growing understanding of female sexual function made it no longer tenable for mainstream society to avoid the sexual connotations of the devices.{{sfn|Maines|1999|p=104-109}}\n\n====Conjectured early use for female sexual stimulation====\n[[File:Sears - Aids That Every Woman Appreciates.jpg|thumb|300px|Sears, Roebuck and Company catalog, 1918]]\nHistorian of technology [[Rachel Maines]], in her book ''The Technology of Orgasm'',{{sfn|Maines|1999}} has argued that the development of the vibrator in the late 19th century was in large part due to the requirements of doctors for an easier way to perform genital massage on women, often to 'hysterical paroxysm' ([[orgasm]]), which was historically a treatment for the once common medical diagnosis of [[female hysteria]]. Maines writes that this treatment had been recommended since classical antiquity in Europe, including in the [[Hippocratic corpus]] and by [[Galen]], and continued to be used into the medieval and modern periods,{{sfn|Maines|1999|p=23-24}} but was not seen as sexual by physicians due to the absence of penetration,{{sfn|Maines|1999|p=10}} and was viewed by them as a difficult and tedious task.{{sfn|Maines|1999|p=67-68}} Maines writes that the first use of the vibrator at the Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re was on hysterical women, but notes that Joseph Mortimer Granville denied that he had, or ever would have, used his invention for this purpose;{{sfn|Maines|1999|p=94}} additionally, Maines states that the true use of these medical vibrators, and the vibrators marketed for home use in the early 20th century, was not openly stated, but proceeded under 'social camouflage'.{{sfn|Maines|1999|p=20}} One example of suggestive advertising given is a 1908 advert in ''National Home Journal'' for the Bebout hand-powered mechanical vibrator, containing the text \"Gentle, soothing, invigorating and refreshing. Invented by a woman who knows a woman's needs.\"{{sfn|Maines|1999|p=100}}\n\nOther historians disagree with Maines about the historical prevalence of genital massage as a treatment for female hysteria, and over the extent to which early vibrating massagers were used for this purpose.

It is named after the [[Lakota people|Lakota]] and Dakota [[Sioux]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes, who compose a large portion of the population and historically dominated the territory. South Dakota is the [[List of U.S. states and territories by area|seventeenth largest by area]], but the [[List of U.S. states and territories by population|fifth smallest by population]] and the [[List of U.S. states and territories by population density|5th least densely populated]] of the [[List of U.S. states|50 United States]]. As the southern part of the former [[Dakota Territory]], South Dakota became a state on November 2, 1889, simultaneously with [[North Dakota]]. [[Pierre, South Dakota|Pierre]] is the state capital and [[Sioux Falls, South Dakota|Sioux Falls]], with a population of about 187,200,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.siouxfalls.org/news/2019/February/04/population|title=Sioux Falls Population Grows to Estimated 187,200|publisher=City of Sioux Falls|accessdate=March 13, 2019}}</ref> is South Dakota's largest city.\n\nSouth Dakota is bordered by the states of [[North Dakota]] (to the north), [[Minnesota]] (to the east), [[Iowa]] (to the southeast), [[Nebraska]] (to the south), [[Wyoming]] (to the west), and [[Montana]] (to the northwest). The state is bisected by the [[Missouri River]], dividing South Dakota into two geographically and socially distinct halves, known to residents as \"[[East River (South Dakota)|East River]]\" and \"[[West River (South Dakota)|West River]]\".<ref name=eastwestriver>Hasselstrom, pp. 2\u20134.</ref>\n\nEastern South Dakota is home to most of the state's population, and the area's fertile soil is used to grow a variety of crops. West of the Missouri River, [[ranch]]ing is the predominant agricultural activity, and the economy is more dependent on tourism and defense spending. Most of the Native American reservations are in [[West River (South Dakota)|West River]]. The [[Black Hills]], a group of low pine-covered mountains sacred to the Sioux, are in the southwest part of the state. [[Mount Rushmore]], a major tourist destination, is there. South Dakota has a temperate [[continental climate]], with four distinct seasons and precipitation ranging from moderate in the east to semi-arid in the west. The state's ecology features species typical of a North American [[grassland]] biome.\n\nHumans have inhabited the area for several millennia, with the Sioux becoming dominant by the early 19th century. In the late 19th century, European-American settlement intensified after a [[Black Hills Gold Rush|gold rush]] in the Black Hills and the construction of railroads from the east. Encroaching miners and settlers triggered a number of [[American Indian Wars|Indian wars]], ending with the [[Wounded Knee Massacre]] in 1890. Key events in the 20th century included the [[Dust Bowl]] and [[Great Depression]], increased federal spending during the 1940s and 1950s for agriculture and defense, and an industrialization of agriculture that has reduced family farming.\n\nWhile several [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] have represented South Dakota for multiple terms in both chambers of [[Congress (United States)|Congress]], the state government is largely controlled by the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], whose nominees have carried South Dakota in each of the last 13 [[United States presidential election|presidential elections]]. Historically dominated by an agricultural economy and a rural lifestyle, South Dakota has recently sought to diversify its economy in areas to attract and retain residents. South Dakota's history and rural character still strongly influence the state's culture.\n\n==Geography==\n\n{{Main|Geography of South Dakota}}\n[[File:South Dakota general map 2.png|thumb|left|upright=1.15|Terrain and primary geographic features of South Dakota]]\n\nSouth Dakota is in the north-central United States, and is considered a part of the [[Midwest]] by the U.S. Census Bureau;<ref>[http://www2.census.gov/geo/pdfs/maps-data/maps/reference/us_regdiv.pdf Census Regions and Divisions of the United States] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171219134403/https://www2.census.gov/geo/pdfs/maps-data/maps/reference/us_regdiv.pdf |date=December 19, 2017 }}, U.S. Census Bureau.

The geography of the Black Hills, long considered sacred by Native Americans, differs from its surroundings to such an extent it can be considered separate from the rest of western South Dakota. At times the Black Hills are combined with the rest of western South Dakota, and people often refer to the resulting two regions divided by the Missouri River as [[West River (South Dakota)|West River]] and [[East River (South Dakota)|East River]].<ref name=eastwestriver/><ref name=NYTimesEastWest/>\n[[File:Badlands panorama1.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|[[Badlands National Park]]]]\n\nEastern South Dakota generally features higher precipitation and lower topography than the western part of the state.

While Dunn worked most of his career as a commercial illustrator, his most famous works showed various scenes of frontier life; he completed these near the end of his career.<ref>Hasselstrom, pp. 34\u201336.</ref> [[Oscar Howe]] ([[Crow]]) was born on the [[Crow Creek Indian Reservation]] and won fame for his watercolor paintings.<ref>Hasselstrom, pp. 215\u2013217.</ref> Howe was one of the first Native American painters to adopt techniques and style heavily influenced by the mid-20th century [[abstraction]] movement, rather than relying on traditional Native American styles. [[Terry Redlin]], originally from [[Watertown, South Dakota|Watertown]], is an accomplished painter of rural and wildlife scenes.

South Dakota is the [[List of U.S. states and territories by area|seventeenth largest by area]], but the [[List of U.S. states and territories by population|fifth smallest by population]] and the [[List of U.S. states and territories by population density|5th least densely populated]] of the [[List of U.S. states|50 United States]]. As the southern part of the former [[Dakota Territory]], South Dakota became a state on November 2, 1889, simultaneously with [[North Dakota]]. [[Pierre, South Dakota|Pierre]] is the state capital and [[Sioux Falls, South Dakota|Sioux Falls]], with a population of about 187,200,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.siouxfalls.org/news/2019/February/04/population|title=Sioux Falls Population Grows to Estimated 187,200|publisher=City of Sioux Falls|accessdate=March 13, 2019}}</ref> is South Dakota's largest city.\n\nSouth Dakota is bordered by the states of [[North Dakota]] (to the north), [[Minnesota]] (to the east), [[Iowa]] (to the southeast), [[Nebraska]] (to the south), [[Wyoming]] (to the west), and [[Montana]] (to the northwest). The state is bisected by the [[Missouri River]], dividing South Dakota into two geographically and socially distinct halves, known to residents as \"[[East River (South Dakota)|East River]]\" and \"[[West River (South Dakota)|West River]]\".<ref name=eastwestriver>Hasselstrom, pp. 2\u20134.</ref>\n\nEastern South Dakota is home to most of the state's population, and the area's fertile soil is used to grow a variety of crops. West of the Missouri River, [[ranch]]ing is the predominant agricultural activity, and the economy is more dependent on tourism and defense spending. Most of the Native American reservations are in [[West River (South Dakota)|West River]]. The [[Black Hills]], a group of low pine-covered mountains sacred to the Sioux, are in the southwest part of the state. [[Mount Rushmore]], a major tourist destination, is there. South Dakota has a temperate [[continental climate]], with four distinct seasons and precipitation ranging from moderate in the east to semi-arid in the west. The state's ecology features species typical of a North American [[grassland]] biome.\n\nHumans have inhabited the area for several millennia, with the Sioux becoming dominant by the early 19th century. In the late 19th century, European-American settlement intensified after a [[Black Hills Gold Rush|gold rush]] in the Black Hills and the construction of railroads from the east. Encroaching miners and settlers triggered a number of [[American Indian Wars|Indian wars]], ending with the [[Wounded Knee Massacre]] in 1890. Key events in the 20th century included the [[Dust Bowl]] and [[Great Depression]], increased federal spending during the 1940s and 1950s for agriculture and defense, and an industrialization of agriculture that has reduced family farming.\n\nWhile several [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] have represented South Dakota for multiple terms in both chambers of [[Congress (United States)|Congress]], the state government is largely controlled by the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], whose nominees have carried South Dakota in each of the last 13 [[United States presidential election|presidential elections]]. Historically dominated by an agricultural economy and a rural lifestyle, South Dakota has recently sought to diversify its economy in areas to attract and retain residents. South Dakota's history and rural character still strongly influence the state's culture.\n\n==Geography==\n\n{{Main|Geography of South Dakota}}\n[[File:South Dakota general map 2.png|thumb|left|upright=1.15|Terrain and primary geographic features of South Dakota]]\n\nSouth Dakota is in the north-central United States, and is considered a part of the [[Midwest]] by the U.S. Census Bureau;<ref>[http://www2.census.gov/geo/pdfs/maps-data/maps/reference/us_regdiv.pdf Census Regions and Divisions of the United States] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171219134403/https://www2.census.gov/geo/pdfs/maps-data/maps/reference/us_regdiv.pdf |date=December 19, 2017 }}, U.S. Census Bureau.

She hasn't let the dialogue overpower the narrative. It helps that the drama's production values are excellent as is the visual story telling with hints at the character's inner lives''.<ref name=\"MNYH\"/> She lauded [[Maya Ali (actress)|Maya Alli]], [[Imran Abbas Naqvi]] and [[Hina Khawaja Bayat]]'s role by saying ''Maya Ali\u2019s restrained performance as Zulekha proves she's a director\u2019s actor and so far Mehreen Jabbar has guided her well.

She further added that \"It isn't merely filmi in the sense that it features over-the-top melodrama; there are also a fair number of larger-than-life events to contend with.

[[Egypt]]ian city on the southern tip of the [[Sinai Peninsula]], in [[South Sinai Governorate]], on the coastal strip along the [[Red Sea]]. Its population is approximately 73,000 {{as of|2015|lc=yes}}. Sharm El Sheikh is the administrative hub of Egypt's South Sinai Governorate, which includes the smaller coastal towns of [[Dahab]] and [[Nuweiba]] as well as the mountainous interior, [[Saint Catherine, Egypt|St. Catherine]] and [[Mount Sinai]]. The city and holiday resort is a significant centre for tourism in Egypt, while also attracting many international conferences and diplomatic meetings.\n\n==Name==\nSharm El Sheikh (meaning \"Bay of the Sheikh\") is also known as the \"City of Peace; [[Egyptian Arabic]]: Madinet Es-Salaam\", referring to the large number of [[Conference|international peace conferences]] that have been held there.<ref name=\"City of Peace\">{{cite news|last1=Al-Mukhtar|first1=Rima|title=Sharm El-Sheikh, city of peace|url=http://www.arabnews.com/travel/sharm-el-sheikh-city-peace|accessdate=23 May 2018|work=Arab News|date=23 November 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190426061414/http://www.arabnews.com/travel/sharm-el-sheikh-city-peace|archive-date=26 April 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> It was known as \u015earm-\u00fc\u015f \u015eeyh during Ottoman rule, and as Ofira when the area was under [[Israel]]i control between 1967 and 1982. Among [[Egyptians]] and many visitors, the name of the city is commonly shortened to \"Sharm\" ({{IPA-arz|\u0283\u0251\u027em|lang}}), which is its common name in the [[Egyptian Arabic|Egyptian slang]]. The name is also sometimes written as Sharm el-Cheikh, Sharm el-Sheik in English.\n\n==Geography and history==\n[[File:Sharm el Sheikh map.png|thumb|right|240px|Sharm El Sheikh is located on the Egyptian [[Red Sea]]  coast, at the southern tip of the [[Sinai Peninsula]].]]\nSharm El Sheikh is on a [[promontory]] overlooking the [[Straits of Tiran]] at the mouth of the [[Gulf of Aqaba]]. Its strategic importance led to its transformation from a fishing village into a major [[port]] and [[naval base]] for the [[Egyptian Navy]]. It was occupied by [[Israel]] during the [[Suez Crisis]] of 1956 and restored to Egypt in 1957. A [[United Nations]] peacekeeping force was subsequently stationed there until the 1967 [[Six-Day War]] when it was recaptured by Israel. Sharm El Sheikh remained under Israeli control until the [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai]] peninsula was given to Egypt in 1982 after the [[Egypt\u2013Israel Peace Treaty]] of 1979.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}\n\nA hierarchical planning approach was adopted for the [[Gulf of Aqaba]], whereby their components were evaluated and subdivided into zones, cities and centers. In accordance with this approach, the Gulf of Aqaba zone was subdivided into four cities: [[Taba (Egypt)|Taba]], [[Nuweiba]], [[Dahab]] and Sharm El Sheikh. Sharm El Sheikh city has been subdivided into five homogeneous centers, namely Nabq, Ras Nusrani, [[Naama Bay]], Umm Sid and Sharm El Maya.\n\nSharm El Sheikh city, together with [[Naama Bay]], Hay el Nour, Hadaba, Rowaysat, Montazah and [[Shark's Bay, Sharm El Sheikh)|Shark's Bay]] form a [[metropolitan area]].\n\nBefore 1967, Sharm El Sheikh was little more than an occasional base of operations for local fishermen; the nearest permanent settlement was in Nabk, north of Ras El Nasrani (\"The Tiran Straits\"). Commercial development of the area began when the Israelis built the town of [[Ofira]], overlooking Sharm El Maya Bay and the Nesima area, and opened the first tourist-oriented establishments in the area 6&nbsp;km north at Naama Bay. These included a [[marina]] [[hotel]] on the southern side of the bay, a nature field school on the northern side, [[diving club]]s, a now well-known promenade, and the Naama Bay Hotel. {{citation needed|date=May 2011}} The site off the shore gun emplacements at Ras Nasrani opposite Tiran Island is now a diving area.<ref>The Jewish Agency's Digest of Press and Events Jewish Agency for Israel - 1956 Egyptian Blockade The point on the south-eastern coast of Sinai directly facing Tiran is known as Ras Nasrani.\"</ref><ref>Kenes Ha-shenati - Page 50 \u1e24evrah ha-ge\u02bcologit ha-Yi\u015bre\u02bcelit.

Foreign investors \u2013 some of whom had discovered the potential of the locality during the Israeli occupation \u2013 contributed to a spate of building projects. Environmental zoning laws currently limit the height of buildings in Sharm El Sheikh so as to avoid obscuring the natural beauty of the surroundings.\n\nIn 2005, the resort was hit by the [[2005 Sharm El Sheikh bombings|Sharm El Sheikh terrorist attacks]], which were perpetrated by an extremist [[Islamist]] organisation targeting Egypt's tourist industry. Eighty-eight people were killed, the majority of them Egyptians, and over 200 were wounded by the attack, making it the second deadliest terrorist attack in the country's history. The deadliest terrorist attack took place in Sinai when Militants detonated a bomb inside a crowded mosque in the Sinai Peninsula on [[2017 Sinai mosque attack|24 November 2017]] and then sprayed gunfire on panicked worshipers as they fled, killing at least 305 people and wounding at least 128 others.<ref>{{cite news|title=Militants Kill 305 at Sufi Mosque in Egypt\u2019s Deadliest Terrorist Attack|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/24/world/middleeast/mosque-attack-egypt.html|work=New York Times|date=November 25, 2017|page=A1|access-date=August 11, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171126223759/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/24/world/middleeast/mosque-attack-egypt.html|archive-date=November 26, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> The third deadliest was the [[Luxor massacre]] of 1997).<ref>[http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2005/752/fr4.htm Shock in Sharm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130924125054/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2005/752/fr4.htm |date=2013-09-24 }} 23 July, Serene Assir, ''Al-Ahram Weekly''</ref>\n\n[[File:Direct talks in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt, on September 14, 2010 2.jpg|thumb|The city has hosted a number of important Middle Eastern peace conferences, including [[2010\u201311 Israeli\u2013Palestinian peace talks|2010 Israeli-Palestinian direct talks]].]]\nThe city has played host to a number of important Middle Eastern peace conferences, including the 4 September 1999 agreement to restore Palestinian self-rule over the [[Gaza Strip]].

[[Egypt]]ian city on the southern tip of the [[Sinai Peninsula]], in [[South Sinai Governorate]], on the coastal strip along the [[Red Sea]]. Its population is approximately 73,000 {{as of|2015|lc=yes}}. Sharm El Sheikh is the administrative hub of Egypt's South Sinai Governorate, which includes the smaller coastal towns of [[Dahab]] and [[Nuweiba]] as well as the mountainous interior, [[Saint Catherine, Egypt|St. Catherine]] and [[Mount Sinai]]. The city and holiday resort is a significant centre for tourism in Egypt, while also attracting many international conferences and diplomatic meetings.\n\n==Name==\nSharm El Sheikh (meaning \"Bay of the Sheikh\") is also known as the \"City of Peace; [[Egyptian Arabic]]: Madinet Es-Salaam\", referring to the large number of [[Conference|international peace conferences]] that have been held there.<ref name=\"City of Peace\">{{cite news|last1=Al-Mukhtar|first1=Rima|title=Sharm El-Sheikh, city of peace|url=http://www.arabnews.com/travel/sharm-el-sheikh-city-peace|accessdate=23 May 2018|work=Arab News|date=23 November 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190426061414/http://www.arabnews.com/travel/sharm-el-sheikh-city-peace|archive-date=26 April 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> It was known as \u015earm-\u00fc\u015f \u015eeyh during Ottoman rule, and as Ofira when the area was under [[Israel]]i control between 1967 and 1982. Among [[Egyptians]] and many visitors, the name of the city is commonly shortened to \"Sharm\" ({{IPA-arz|\u0283\u0251\u027em|lang}}), which is its common name in the [[Egyptian Arabic|Egyptian slang]]. The name is also sometimes written as Sharm el-Cheikh, Sharm el-Sheik in English.\n\n==Geography and history==\n[[File:Sharm el Sheikh map.png|thumb|right|240px|Sharm El Sheikh is located on the Egyptian [[Red Sea]]  coast, at the southern tip of the [[Sinai Peninsula]].]]\nSharm El Sheikh is on a [[promontory]] overlooking the [[Straits of Tiran]] at the mouth of the [[Gulf of Aqaba]]. Its strategic importance led to its transformation from a fishing village into a major [[port]] and [[naval base]] for the [[Egyptian Navy]]. It was occupied by [[Israel]] during the [[Suez Crisis]] of 1956 and restored to Egypt in 1957. A [[United Nations]] peacekeeping force was subsequently stationed there until the 1967 [[Six-Day War]] when it was recaptured by Israel. Sharm El Sheikh remained under Israeli control until the [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai]] peninsula was given to Egypt in 1982 after the [[Egypt\u2013Israel Peace Treaty]] of 1979.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}\n\nA hierarchical planning approach was adopted for the [[Gulf of Aqaba]], whereby their components were evaluated and subdivided into zones, cities and centers. In accordance with this approach, the Gulf of Aqaba zone was subdivided into four cities: [[Taba (Egypt)|Taba]], [[Nuweiba]], [[Dahab]] and Sharm El Sheikh. Sharm El Sheikh city has been subdivided into five homogeneous centers, namely Nabq, Ras Nusrani, [[Naama Bay]], Umm Sid and Sharm El Maya.\n\nSharm El Sheikh city, together with [[Naama Bay]], Hay el Nour, Hadaba, Rowaysat, Montazah and [[Shark's Bay, Sharm El Sheikh)|Shark's Bay]] form a [[metropolitan area]].\n\nBefore 1967, Sharm El Sheikh was little more than an occasional base of operations for local fishermen; the nearest permanent settlement was in Nabk, north of Ras El Nasrani (\"The Tiran Straits\"). Commercial development of the area began when the Israelis built the town of [[Ofira]], overlooking Sharm El Maya Bay and the Nesima area, and opened the first tourist-oriented establishments in the area 6&nbsp;km north at Naama Bay. These included a [[marina]] [[hotel]] on the southern side of the bay, a nature field school on the northern side, [[diving club]]s, a now well-known promenade, and the Naama Bay Hotel. {{citation needed|date=May 2011}} The site off the shore gun emplacements at Ras Nasrani opposite Tiran Island is now a diving area.<ref>The Jewish Agency's Digest of Press and Events Jewish Agency for Israel - 1956 Egyptian Blockade The point on the south-eastern coast of Sinai directly facing Tiran is known as Ras Nasrani.\"</ref><ref>Kenes Ha-shenati - Page 50 \u1e24evrah ha-ge\u02bcologit ha-Yi\u015bre\u02bcelit.

Foreign investors \u2013 some of whom had discovered the potential of the locality during the Israeli occupation \u2013 contributed to a spate of building projects. Environmental zoning laws currently limit the height of buildings in Sharm El Sheikh so as to avoid obscuring the natural beauty of the surroundings.\n\nIn 2005, the resort was hit by the [[2005 Sharm El Sheikh bombings|Sharm El Sheikh terrorist attacks]], which were perpetrated by an extremist [[Islamist]] organisation targeting Egypt's tourist industry. Eighty-eight people were killed, the majority of them Egyptians, and over 200 were wounded by the attack, making it the second deadliest terrorist attack in the country's history. The deadliest terrorist attack took place in Sinai when Militants detonated a bomb inside a crowded mosque in the Sinai Peninsula on [[2017 Sinai mosque attack|24 November 2017]] and then sprayed gunfire on panicked worshipers as they fled, killing at least 305 people and wounding at least 128 others.<ref>{{cite news|title=Militants Kill 305 at Sufi Mosque in Egypt\u2019s Deadliest Terrorist Attack|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/24/world/middleeast/mosque-attack-egypt.html|work=New York Times|date=November 25, 2017|page=A1|access-date=August 11, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171126223759/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/24/world/middleeast/mosque-attack-egypt.html|archive-date=November 26, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> The third deadliest was the [[Luxor massacre]] of 1997).<ref>[http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2005/752/fr4.htm Shock in Sharm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130924125054/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2005/752/fr4.htm |date=2013-09-24 }} 23 July, Serene Assir, ''Al-Ahram Weekly''</ref>\n\n[[File:Direct talks in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt, on September 14, 2010 2.jpg|thumb|The city has hosted a number of important Middle Eastern peace conferences, including [[2010\u201311 Israeli\u2013Palestinian peace talks|2010 Israeli-Palestinian direct talks]].]]\nThe city has played host to a number of important Middle Eastern peace conferences, including the 4 September 1999 agreement to restore Palestinian self-rule over the [[Gaza Strip]].
