Students begin to disappear... Three students of Saint-Agil, Beaume Sorgue and Macroy, have created a secret society to prepare leaving for America. One evening, one of them, Sorgue, sees a man through a wall in the natural sciences class. He then disappears after having been sent to the principal's office.

The network is headquartered in [[Burbank, California]], on Riverside Drive, directly across the street from [[Walt Disney Studios (Burbank)|Walt Disney Studios]] and adjacent to the Roy E. Disney Animation Building. The network's secondary offices, and headquarters of its news division, is in [[New York City]], at its broadcast center at 77 [[66th Street (Manhattan)|West 66th Street]] on the [[Upper West Side, Manhattan|Upper West Side]] of [[Manhattan]].\n\nSince 2007, when [[Cumulus Media Networks|ABC Radio]] (also known as Cumulus Media Networks) was sold to [[Citadel Broadcasting]], ABC has reduced its broadcasting operations almost exclusively to television. It is the fifth-oldest major broadcasting network in the world and the youngest of the [[Big Three television networks]]. ABC is nicknamed \"'''The Alphabet Network'''\", as its [[initialism]] also represents the first three letters of the [[English alphabet]], in order.<ref>https://variety.com/2016/digital/news/abc-free-streaming-app-7-abcd-originals-1201813330/</ref>\n\nABC launched as a [[radio network]] in 1943, which served as the successor to the [[Blue Network|NBC Blue Network]], which had been purchased by [[Edward John Noble|Edward J. Noble]]. It extended its operations to television in 1948, following in the footsteps of established broadcast networks [[CBS]] and [[NBC]]. In the mid-1950s, ABC merged with [[American Broadcasting-Paramount Theatres|United Paramount Theatres]], a chain of movie theaters that formerly operated as a subsidiary of [[Paramount Pictures]]. [[Leonard Goldenson]], who had been the head of UPT, made the new television network profitable by helping develop and greenlight many successful series. In the 1980s, after purchasing an 80 percent interest in cable sports channel [[ESPN]], the network's corporate parent, American Broadcasting Companies, Inc., merged with [[Capital Cities/ABC Inc.|Capital Cities Communications]], owner of several print publications, and television and radio stations. In 1996, most of Capital Cities/ABC's assets were purchased by Disney.\n\nABC has eight [[owned-and-operated station|owned-and-operated]] and over 232 [[network affiliate|affiliated]] television stations throughout the United States and its territories. Some ABC-affiliated stations can also be seen in Canada via pay-television providers, and certain other affiliates can also be received over-the-air in areas near the [[Canada\u2013United States border]]. [[ABC News]] provides news and features content for select radio stations owned by [[Cumulus Media]], as these stations are former ABC Radio properties.\n\n==History==\n\n===Blue Network (1927\u20131945)===\n{{main|Blue Network}}\nIn the 1930s, radio in the United States was dominated by three companies: the [[CBS|Columbia Broadcasting System]] (CBS), the [[Mutual Broadcasting System]], and the [[NBC|National Broadcasting Company]] (NBC). The last was owned by electronics manufacturer [[RCA|Radio Corporation of America]] (RCA), which owned two radio networks that each ran different varieties of programming, [[Blue Network|NBC Blue]] and [[NBC Radio Network|NBC Red]]. The NBC Blue Network was created in 1927 for the primary purpose of testing new programs on markets of lesser importance than those served by NBC Red, which served the major cities,{{Sfn|Goldenson|Wolf|1991\u20131993|p=96}} and to test drama series.{{Sfn|Sterling|2004|p=291}}\n\nIn 1934, Mutual filed a complaint with the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) regarding its difficulties in establishing new stations, in a radio market that was already being saturated by NBC and CBS.{{Sfn|Sterling|2004|p=291}} In 1938, the FCC began a series of investigations into the practices of radio networks{{Sfn|Sterling|2004|p=291}} and published its report on the broadcasting of network radio programs in 1940. The report recommended that RCA give up control of either NBC Red or NBC Blue.{{Sfn|Goldenson|Wolf|1991\u20131993|p=96}} At that time, the NBC Red Network was the principal radio network in the United States and, according to the FCC, RCA was using NBC Blue to eliminate any hint of competition.

ABC's flagship productions at the time were ''[[The Lone Ranger (TV series)|The Lone Ranger]]'', based on the radio program of the same title, and ''[[The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet]]'', the latter of which (at 14 seasons, running from 1952 to 1966) held the record for the longest-running prime time comedy in U.S. television history, until it was surpassed by ''[[The Simpsons]]'' in 2003.\n\nGoldenson's efforts paid off, and on October 27, 1954, the network launched a campaign ushering in the \"New ABC\", with productions from several studios, including [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], [[Warner Bros.]] and [[20th Century Fox]].{{Sfn|Boddy|1992|pp=147\u2013148}}\n\nWarner tried with mixed success to adapt some of its most successful films as ABC television series, and showcase these adaptations as part of the [[wheel series]] ''[[Warner Bros.

Most markets outside the largest ones were not large enough to support three full-time network affiliates. In some markets that were large enough for a third full-time affiliate, the only available commercial allocation was on the less-desirable [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] band. Until the [[All-Channel Receiver Act]] (passed by Congress in 1961) mandated the inclusion of UHF tuning, most viewers needed to purchase a converter to be able to watch UHF stations, and the signal quality was marginal at best even with a converter. Additionally, during the analog television era, UHF stations were not adequately receivable in markets that either covered large areas or had rugged terrain. These factors made many prospective station owners skittish about investing in a UHF station, especially one that would have had to take on an affiliation with a weaker network.\n\nAs a result, with the exception of the largest markets, ABC was relegated to secondary status on one or both of the existing stations, usually via off-hours clearances (a notable exception during this time was WKST-TV in [[Youngstown, Ohio]], now [[WYTV]], despite the small size of the surrounding market and its close proximity to [[Cleveland]] and [[Pittsburgh]] even decades before [[Economy of Youngstown, Ohio#Black Monday|the city's economic collapse]]). According to Goldenson, this meant that an hour of ABC programming reported five times lower viewership than its competitors.{{Sfn|Goldenson|Wolf|1991\u20131993|p=116}} The network's intake of money at the time would allow it to accelerate its content production. Still, ABC's limited reach would continue to hobble it for the next two decades. Several smaller markets would not grow large enough to support a full-time ABC affiliate until the 1960s, with some very small markets having to wait as late as the 1980s or even the advent of [[digital terrestrial television|digital television]] in the 2000s, which allowed stations like [[WTRF-TV]] in [[Wheeling, West Virginia]], to begin airing ABC programming on a [[digital subchannel]] after relegating the network to off-hours clearances decades before.\n\nThe DuMont Television Network ceased broadcasting on September 15, 1955,{{Sfn|Long|1979|p=110}} and went bankrupt the next year. ABC then found itself as the third U.S. television network, dubbed the \"little third network\",{{Sfn|Smith|1998|p=151}} but still continued to look for successful programming. That same year, Kintner was forced to resign due to disagreements between Noble and Goldenson,{{Sfn|Goldenson|Wolf|1991\u20131993|p=104}} a consequence of Goldenson's many interventions in ABC's management.{{Sfn|Wittebols|2004|p=22}}\n\n====Counterprogramming: successful, but criticized====\n[[File:American Bandstand 50th reunion.jpg|thumb|right|In 2002, dancers and other cast members from the 32-year run of ''American Bandstand'' reunited with host [[Dick Clark]] to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the show's local television debut.]]\nIt was not until the late 1950s that the ABC network became a serious contender to NBC and CBS, and this was in large part due to the diverse range of programming that met the expectations of the public, such as westerns and detective series.<!--missing source: {{Sfn|Baughman|1979|p=57}}--> Despite an almost 500% increase in advertising revenues between 1953 and 1958, the network only had a national reach of between 10% and 18% of the total U.S. population, as it still had relatively fewer affiliates than NBC and CBS.{{Sfn|Boddy|1992|p=147}} In 1957, ABC Entertainment president Ollie Trez discovered that the locally produced variety show ''Bandstand'' had pulled very strong ratings in the Philadelphia market on WFIL-TV; Trez ultimately negotiated a deal to take the show national, under the revised title ''[[American Bandstand]]'';{{Sfn|Goldenson|Wolf|1991\u20131993|pp=161\u2013163}} the show quickly became a social phenomenon by presenting new musical talent and dances to America's youth{{Sfn|Goldenson|Wolf|1991\u20131993|pp=161\u2013163}} and helped make a star out of its host, Dick Clark.\n\nOn September 3, 1958, the ''Disneyland'' anthology series was retitled ''Walt Disney Presents''{{Sfn|Smith|1998|p=152}} as it became disassociated with the theme park of the same name. The movement in westerns, which ABC is credited for having started, represented a fifth of all primetime series on American television in January 1959, at which point detective shows were beginning to rise in popularity as well.{{Sfn|Baughman|Atack|1983|p=59}} ABC requested additional productions from Disney.{{Sfn|Cotter|1997|p=66}} In late 1958, [[Desilu Productions]] pitched its detective series ''[[The Untouchables (1959 TV series)|The Untouchables]]'' Starring [[Robert Stack]] to CBS; after that network rejected the show because of its use of violence, Desilu then presented it to ABC, which agreed to pick up the show,{{Sfn|Baughman|Atack|1983|p=63}} and debuted ''The Untouchables'' in April 1959. The series went on to quickly become \"immensely popular\".{{Sfn|Baughman|Atack|1983|p=63}}\n\nThese kinds of programs presented ABC with an image of the \"philosophy of counterprogramming against its competitors\", offering a strong lineup of programs that contrasted with those seen on its rival networks,{{Sfn|Cotter|1997|p=66}} which helped Goldenson give the network a continuum between film and television.{{Sfn|Baughman|Atack|1983|p=60}} ABC's western series (as well as series such as the actioner ''[[Zorro (1957 TV series)|Zorro]]'') went up against and defeated the variety shows aired by NBC and CBS in the fall of 1957, and its detective shows did the same in the fall of 1959.

The network's finances improved and allowed it to invest in other properties and programming. In May 1960, ABC purchased [[Farm Progress]], owner of Chicago radio station [[WLS (AM)|WLS]], which had shared airtime with WENR since the 1920s.{{Sfn|Childers|2008|p=8}} This acquisition allowed ABC to consolidate its presence in the market.

Also, in the summer of 1975, ABC discovered that its Cleveland affiliate [[WEWS-TV]] was producing its own morning program ''[[The Morning Exchange]]'', which debuted in 1972 and was now locally pre-empting ''AM America''; it was the first morning show to utilize a set modeled after a [[living room]], and established a concept now commonplace among network morning shows in which news and weather updates were featured at the top and bottom of each hour. Discovering that their formats seemed to appeal to their viewers,{{Sfn|Goldenson|Wolf|1991\u20131993|p=353}} the network became the first to adopt them for a new national morning show, ''[[Good Morning America]]'', which debuted on November 3, 1975.{{Sfn|Goldenson|Wolf|1991\u20131993|p=353}}\n\nThe 1970s were highlighted by several successful comedy, fantasy, action and superhero-themed series for the network including ''[[Kung Fu (TV series)|Kung Fu]]'', ''[[The Six Million Dollar Man]]'', ''[[Wonder Woman (TV series)|Wonder Woman]]'', ''[[Starsky & Hutch]]'', ''[[Charlie's Angels]]'', ''[[The Bionic Woman]]'', ''[[Fantasy Island]]'' and ''[[Battlestar Galactica (1978 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]''. Many of these series were greenlit by Silverman, who left ABC in 1978 to become president of NBC's entertainment division. The rousing success of ''Happy Days'' also led to a successful spin-off series, ''[[Laverne & Shirley]]'', which debuted during the 1975\u201376 season. ''Charlie's Angels'' and ''[[Three's Company]]'' (which debuted during the 1976\u201377 season) were two prime examples of a trend among the major networks during the 1970s known as \"[[jiggle TV]]\", featuring attractive, often buxom, women in main and guest roles.\n\nIn 1977, Henry Plitt, who at the time was associated with Thomas Klutznick, a real estate entrepreneur in Chicago, purchased the southern division of ABC Theatres, ABC Southern.{{Sfn|Goldenson|Wolf|1991\u20131993|p=231}} The sale stripped ABC of control over its theaters as a result of changes in the theater operation sector, mainly the fact that the population was migrating to the suburbs and moving away from older cinemas in larger cities{{Sfn|Goldenson|Wolf|1991\u20131993|p=231}} ([[Plitt Theatres]] was later purchased by [[Cineplex Odeon Corporation]] in 1987{{Sfn|Goldenson|Wolf|1991\u20131993|p=231}}).\n\nFor its part, the television network produced a few new hits during 1977: January saw the premiere of ''[[Roots (1977 miniseries)|Roots]]'', a miniseries based on an [[Alex Haley]] [[Roots (novel)|novel]] that was published the previous year.

Meanwhile, a former parking lot, located at 30 West 67th Street, was transformed into an impressive 15-story building. Both buildings were completed in June 1979.

ABC also broadcasts the annual ''[[Disney Parks Christmas Day Parade]]'' special on Christmas morning.\n\nSince 1974, ABC has generally aired ''[[Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve]]''\u2014a [[New Year's Eve]] special featuring music performances and coverage of festivities in New York's [[Times Square Ball|Times Square]]. It was hosted first by its creator [[Dick Clark]], and later by his successor [[Ryan Seacrest]]. The only exception was in 1999, when ABC instead broadcast ''[[ABC 2000 Today]]''\u2014a day-long telecast produced by ABC News as part of the ''[[2000 Today]]'' consortium, which was hosted by [[Peter Jennings]] and covered festivities from around the world (Dick Clark would join Jennings to co-host coverage from Times Square).

Worldwide video rights are currently owned by various companies; for example, [[Kino Lorber]] owns the North American home video rights to the ABC feature film library (along with some lesser known live action films from Disney's library, mostly from [[Touchstone Pictures]], [[Hollywood Pictures]] and [[20th Century Fox]]).\n\nWhen the FCC imposed its [[Financial Interest and Syndication Rules|fin-syn]] rules in 1970, ABC proactively created two companies: Worldvision Enterprises as a syndication distributor, and ABC Circle Films as a production company. However, between the publication and implementation of these regulations, the separation of the network's catalog was made in 1973. The broadcast rights to pre-1973 productions were transferred to Worldvision, which became independent in the same year. The company has been sold several times since [[Paramount Television]] acquired it in 1999, and has most recently been absorbed into [[CBS Television Distribution]], a unit of [[CBS Corporation]]. Nonetheless, Worldvision sold portions of its catalog, including the [[Ruby-Spears]] and Hanna-Barbera libraries, to [[Turner Broadcasting System]] in 1991. With Disney's 1996 purchase of ABC, ABC Circle Films was absorbed into Touchstone Television, a Disney subsidiary which in turn was renamed ABC Studios in 2007.<ref name=\"WDC-ABC\"/>\n\nAlso part of the library are most films in the [[David O. Selznick]] library, the [[Cinerama Productions]]/Palomar theatrical library (with the exception of those films produced in Cinerama which are now under the control of [[Pacific Theatres]] and Flicker Alley), the Selmur Productions catalog that the network acquired some years back, and the in-house productions it continues to produce (such as ''[[America's Funniest Home Videos]]'', ''General Hospital'', ABC News productions, as well as series from [[ABC Studios]] and [[20th Century Fox Television]]), although [[Disney\u2013ABC Domestic Television]] (formerly known as Buena Vista Television) handles domestic television distribution, while [[Disney Media Distribution|Disney\u2013ABC International Television]] (formerly known as Buena Vista International Television) handles international television distribution.\n\n==Stations==\n{{Main|List of ABC television affiliates (by U.S. state)|List of ABC television affiliates (table)|ABC Owned Television Stations}} \n<!--- Please update station count in the below paragraph whenever the accompanying list referenced is updated. --->\nSince its inception, ABC has had many affiliated stations, which include WABC-TV and WPVI-TV, the first two stations to carry the network's programming. ABC has eight owned-and-operated stations, and current and pending affiliation agreements with 236 additional television stations encompassing 49 states, the District of Columbia, four U.S. possessions, Bermuda and [[Saba]];<ref name=re>{{cite web|title=Stations for Network \u2013 ABC|url=http://www.rabbitears.info/search.php?request=network_search&network=ABC|work=RabbitEars.info|accessdate=October 30, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"StationIndex\">{{cite web|title=Network Profile: ABC|url=http://www.stationindex.com/tv/by-net/abc|publisher=Station Index}}</ref> this makes ABC the largest U.S. broadcast television network by total number of affiliates. The network has an estimated national reach of 97.72% of all households in the United States (or 305,347,338 Americans with at least one television set).\n\nCurrently, [[New Jersey]], [[Rhode Island]], and [[Delaware]] are the only U.S. states where ABC does not have a locally licensed affiliate (New Jersey is served by New York City O&O WABC-TV in the north half of the state and Philadelphia O&O WPVI-TV in the south; Rhode Island is served by [[New Bedford, Massachusetts]]-licensed [[WLNE-TV|WLNE]], though outside of the transmitter, all other operations for the station are based in [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]]; and Delaware is served by WPVI and [[Salisbury, Maryland]], affiliate [[WMDT]]). ABC maintains affiliations with low-power stations (broadcasting either in analog or digital) in a few markets, such as [[Birmingham, Alabama]] ([[WBMA-LD]]), [[Lima, Ohio]] ([[WPNM-LP]]) and [[South Bend, Indiana]] ([[WBND-LD]]). In some markets, including the former two mentioned, these stations also maintain digital simulcasts on a subchannel of a co-owned/co-managed full-power television station.\n\nThe network has the unusual distinction of having separately owned and operated affiliates which serve the same market in [[Tampa, Florida]] (WFTS-TV and [[WWSB]]), [[Lincoln, Nebraska]] ([[KLKN-TV]] and [[KHGI-TV]]), and [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]] ([[WZZM]] and [[WOTV]]), with an analogous situation arising in [[Kansas City, Missouri]] ([[KMBC-TV]] and [[KQTV]]). KQTV is licensed to [[St. Joseph, Missouri]], which is designated by [[Nielsen Holdings|Nielsen]] as a separate market from Kansas City despite being located within {{convert|55|mi|km}} of one another (though in the 2010s through digital subchannels, KQTV's competitor in the market, [[News-Press & Gazette Company]], has established locally based affiliates of the other four major networks and [[Telemundo]] on three low-power stations to end St. Joseph's dependence on Kansas City; NPG itself proposed an acquisition of KQTV in April 2019, subject to FCC approval), while WWSB, KHGI and WOTV serve areas that do not receive an adequate signal from their market's primary ABC affiliate (in the case of WWSB, this dates back to when [[WTSP]] was Tampa's primary ABC affiliate prior to 1994, with the former being necessitated to serve the southern part of the Tampa market including the station's [[city of license]], [[Sarasota, Florida|Sarasota]], due to WTSP's transmitter being short-spaced to avoid interfering with the analog signal of [[Miami]] affiliate [[WPLG]] \u2013 which like WTSP, broadcast on VHF channel 10).\n\nThe [[Sinclair Broadcast Group]] is the largest operator of ABC stations by numerical total, owning or providing services to 28 full, primary ABC affiliates and two additional subchannel-only affiliates; Sinclair owns the largest ABC subchannel affiliate by market size, [[WABM|WABM-DT2]]/[[WTTO|WDBB-DT2]] in the Birmingham market, which serve as repeaters of WBMA-LD (which itself is also simulcast on a subchannel of former WBMA satellite [[WGWW]], owned by Sinclair partner company [[Howard Stirk Holdings]]). The E. W. Scripps Company is the largest operator of ABC stations in terms of overall market reach, owning 15 ABC-affiliated stations (including affiliates in larger markets such as [[WEWS|Cleveland]], [[KNXV-TV|Phoenix]], [[WXYZ-TV|Detroit]] and [[KMGH-TV|Denver]]), and through its ownership of [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] affiliate KNXV, [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] affiliate [[KTNV-TV]] and [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]] affiliate [[KGUN-TV]], it is the only provider of ABC programming for the majority of [[Arizona]] (outside the [[Yuma, Arizona|Yuma]]-[[El Centro, California|El Centro]] market) and [[Southern Nevada]].  Scripps also owns and operates several ABC stations in the Mountain and Pacific time zones, including in Denver, [[KGTV|San Diego]], [[KERO-TV|Bakersfield, California]], and [[KIVI-TV|Boise, Idaho]], and when combined with [[ABC Owned Television Stations|the ABC-owned stations]] in [[KABC-TV|Los Angeles]], [[KFSN-TV|Fresno]], and [[KGO-TV|San Francisco]], the affiliations from the News-Press & Gazette Company in [[KEYT-TV|Santa Barbara]], [[KESQ-TV|Palm Springs]], [[KECY-TV|Yuma-El Centro]], and [[KRDO-TV|Colorado Springs-Pueblo]], and Sinclair's affiliations in [[KOMO-TV|Seattle]] and [[KATU|Portland, Oregon]], these four entities control the access of ABC network programming in most of the Western United States, particularly in terms of audience reach.\n\n==Facilities and studios==\nAll of ABC's owned-and-operated stations and affiliates have had their own facilities and studios, but transverse entities have been created to produce national programming. As a result, television series were produced by ABC Circle Films beginning in 1962 and by Touchstone Television beginning in 1985, before Touchstone was reorganized as [[ABC Studios]] in February 2007. Since the 1950s, ABC has had two main production facilities: the ABC Television Center (now The Prospect Studios) on [[Hollywood Boulevard|Prospect Avenue]] in [[Hollywood, California]], shared with the operations of KABC-TV until 1999; and the ABC Television Center, East, a set of studios located throughout New York City.\n\nIn addition to the headquarters building on Riverside Drive, other ABC facilities in Burbank include a building at 3800 West Alameda, known as \"Burbank Center,\" which is primarily associated with [[Disney\u2013ABC Television Group]], and functions as the headquarters and broadcast center for [[Disney Junior]], [[Disney Channel]], [[Disney XD]], [[Freeform (TV channel)|FreeForm]], as well as [[Radio Disney]]. Additionally, [[Disney Television Animation]] has a facility on Empire Avenue near the [[Hollywood Burbank Airport]].  In nearby [[Glendale, California|Glendale]], Disney/ABC also maintains the [[Grand Central Airport (California)#Grand Central Creative Campus|Grand Central Creative Campus]], which houses other company subsidiaries, including the studios of KABC-TV and the Los Angeles bureau of ABC News.\n\nABC owns several facilities in New York grouped mainly on West 66th Street. The main set of facilities is on the corner of Columbus Avenue and West 66th Street. In total, ABC's facilities occupy a combined {{convert|9755|m\u00b2|sqft|sp=us}} of the {{convert|14864|m\u00b2|sqft|sp=us}} of the blocks they encompass.

Similar to sister network ESPN's [[WatchESPN]] service, live streams of ABC stations are only available to [[TV Everywhere|authenticated subscribers of participating pay television providers]] in certain markets. New York City O&O WABC-TV and Philadelphia O&O WPVI-TV were the first stations to offer streams of their programming on the service (with a [[free preview]] for non-subscribers through June 2013), with the six remaining ABC O&Os offering streams by the start of the 2013\u201314 season. [[Hearst Television]] also reached a deal to offer streams of its ABC affiliates (including stations in [[WCVB-TV|Boston]], [[KMBC-TV|Kansas City]], [[WISN-TV|Milwaukee]] and [[WPBF-TV|West Palm Beach]]) on the service, though {{as of|2016|lc=y}} these stations are only available for live-streaming for [[DirecTV]] subscribers.<ref name=variety-watchabc>{{cite news|title=ABC to Stream Live Via App|url=https://variety.com/2013/tv/news/abc-to-stream-live-via-app-1200479778/|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|accessdate=June 1, 2013}}</ref><ref name=engadget-watchabc>{{cite web|title=Watch ABC app with live TV streaming comes to Kindle Fire, but not Google Play|url=https://www.engadget.com/2013/05/31/watch-abc-app-kindle-fire/|work=[[Engadget]]|date=May 31, 2013|accessdate=June 1, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn November 2015, it was reported that ABC had been developing a slate of original digital series for the WatchABC service, internally codenamed \"ABC3\", with one series set to feature [[Iliza Shlesinger]].<ref name=\"Variety-abc3slate\">{{cite news|last1=Wallenstein|first1=Andrew|title=ABC Lines Up Original Series for New Streaming Effort|url=https://variety.com/2015/digital/news/abc-lines-up-original-series-for-new-streaming-effort-exclusive-1201638884/|accessdate=August 1, 2016|work=Variety|date=November 12, 2015}}</ref> In July 2016, ABC re-launched its streaming platforms, dropping the \"WatchABC\" brand, adding a streaming library of 38 classic ABC series, as well as introducing seven original short-form series under the blanket branding ''ABCd''.<ref name=\"variety-abcapp\">{{cite news|last1=Spangler |first1=Todd |title=With 7 Short-Form Originals, Full Seasons of 38 Older Shows|url=https://variety.com/2016/digital/news/abc-free-streaming-app-7-abcd-originals-1201813330/|accessdate=August 1, 2016|work=Variety|date=}}</ref>\n\nThe most recent episodes of the network's shows are usually made available on the ABC app, Hulu and ABC on Demand the day after their original broadcast. In addition, ABC on Demand (like the video-on-demand television services provided by the other U.S. broadcast networks) disallows [[fast forward]]ing of accessed content. Restrictions implemented on January 7, 2014, restrict streaming of the most recent episode of any ABC program on Hulu and the ABC app until eight days after their initial broadcast, in order to encourage live or same-week (via both [[digital video recorder|DVR]] and cable on demand) viewing, with day-after-air streaming on either service limited to subscribers of participating pay television providers (such as [[Comcast]], [[Verizon FiOS]] and [[Time Warner Cable]]) using an [[Internet service provider|ISP]] account via an authenticated user login.\n\n===ABC HD===\n[[File:ABC HD logo.svg|upright=|thumb|left|Logo for ABC HD.]]\nABC's network feeds are transmitted in [[720p]] [[high-definition television|high definition]], the native resolution format for The Walt Disney Company's U.S. television properties. However, most of Hearst Television's 16 ABC-affiliated stations transmit the network's programming in [[1080i]] HD, while 11 other affiliates owned by various companies carry the network feed in [[480i]] [[standard-definition television|standard definition]]<ref name=re/> either due to technical considerations for affiliates of other major networks that carry ABC programming on a digital subchannel or because a primary feed ABC affiliate has not yet upgraded their transmission equipment to allow content to be presented in HD.\n\nABC began its conversion to high definition with the launch of its simulcast feed, ABC HD, on September 16, 2001, at the start of the [[2001\u201302 United States network television schedule|2001\u201302 season]], with its scripted prime time series becoming the first shows to upgrade to the format. The network's slate of freshmen scripted series were broadcast in HD from their debuts, while all scripted series held over from the [[2000\u201301 United States network television schedule|2000\u201301 season]] were converted from standard-definition to high definition beginning that season.\n\nWith the 2011 cancellation of ''[[Supernanny]]'', ''[[Extreme Makeover: Home Edition]]'' became the only remaining program on the network's schedule that was broadcast in [[4:3]] standard definition. All of the network's programming has been presented in HD since January 2012 (with the exception of certain [[Christmas holiday season|holiday]] specials produced prior to 2005 \u2013 such as the ''Peanuts'' specials \u2013 which continue to be presented in 4:3 SD), when ''Extreme Makeover: Home Edition'' ended its run as a regular series and ''One Life to Live'' (which had been presented in [[16:9]] standard definition since 2010) also ended its ABC run. The affiliate-syndicated Saturday morning E/I block ''Litton's Weekend Adventure'' is also broadcast in HD, and was the first children's program block on any U.S. broadcast network to feature programs available in the format upon its September 2011 debut.\n\nOn September 1, 2016, ABC began to use [[16:9]] framing for all of most graphical imaging (primarily the network's logo bug, in-program promotions and generic closing credit sequences as well as sports telecasts, where the BottomLine and scoreboard elements now extend outside the 4:3 frame), requiring its stations and pay television providers to display its programming in a compulsory [[widescreen]] format, either in high definition or standard definition; with the change, some programs (such as ''Grey's Anatomy'', ''The Goldbergs'' and ''Quantico'') also began positioning their main on-screen credits outside the 4:3 aspect ratio. This left [[CBS]] and [[The CW]] as the last two major networks to continue to prefer 4:3 framing for graphics, with CBS converting to 16:9 framing effective September 24, 2018.\n\n==Visual identity==\n[[File:American Broadcasting Company Logo.svg|thumb|right|upright=.682|The \"ABC Circle\" logo, designed by [[Paul Rand]] in 1962]]\nThe ABC logo has evolved many times since the network's creation in 1943. The network's first logo, introduced in 1946, consisted of a television screen containing the letters \"T\" and \"V\", with a vertical ''ABC'' microphone in the center,<ref name=\"logo evolution\">{{cite web|title=The Evolution of ABC |url=http://members.fortunecity.com/tvnetworks/abc/ |publisher=TV Network Extravaganza |accessdate=November 20, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331214424/http://members.fortunecity.com/tvnetworks/abc/ |archivedate=March 31, 2012 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> referencing the network's roots in radio. When the ABC-UPT merger was finalized in 1953, the network introduced a new logo based on the seal of the Federal Communications Commission, with the letters \"ABC\" enclosed in a circular [[Heraldry|shield]] surmounted by the [[bald eagle]].<ref name=\"logo evolution\"/> In 1957, just before the television network began its first color broadcasts, the ABC logo consisted of a tiny lowercase \"abc\" in the center of a large lowercase letter ''a'', a design known as the \"ABC Circle A\".<ref name=\"logo evolution\"/>\n\nIn 1962, graphic designer Paul Rand redesigned the ABC logo into its best-known (and current) form, with the lowercase letters \"abc\" enclosed in a single black circle. The new logo debuted on-air for ABC's promos at the start of the 1963\u201364 season. The letters are strongly reminiscent of the [[Bauhaus (typeface)|Bauhaus]] typeface designed by [[Herbert Bayer]] in the 1920s,{{Sfn|Gernsheimer|2010|p=43}} but also share similarities with several other fonts, such as [[ITC Avant Garde]] and Horatio, and most closely resembling Chalet. The logo's simplicity made it easier to redesign and duplicate, which conferred a benefit for ABC (mostly before the advent of [[computer graphics]]). A color version of this logo was also developed around 1963, and animated as a brief 10-second intro to be shown before the then-small handful of network programs broadcast in color (similar to the NBC \"Laramie\" peacock intro used during that era). The \"a\" was rendered in red, the \"b\" in blue, and the \"c\" in green, against the same single black circle. A variant of this color logo, with the colored letters against a white circle, was also commonly used throughout the 1960s.\n\nThe 1970s and 1980s saw the emergence of many graphical imaging packages for the network which based the logo's setting mainly on special lighting effects then under development including white, blue, pink, rainbow neon and glittering dotted lines. Among the \"ABC Circle\" logo's many variants was a 1977 ID sequence that featured a bubble on a black background representing the circle with glossy gold letters, and as such, was the first ABC identification card to have a three-dimensional appearance.<ref name=\"logo evolution\"/>\n\nIn 1983, for the 40th anniversary of the network's founding, ID sequences had the logo appear in a gold [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] design on a blue background, accompanied by the slogan \"That Special Feeling\" in a script font.<ref name=\"logo evolution\"/> Ten years later, in 1993, the \"ABC Circle\" logo reverted to its classic white-on-black color scheme, but with gloss effects on both the circle and the letters, and a bronze border surrounding the circle.<ref name=\"logo evolution\"/> The ABC logo first appeared as an [[digital on-screen graphic|on-screen bug]] in the [[1993\u201394 United States network television schedule|1993\u201394 season]], appearing initially only for 60 seconds at the beginning of an act or segment, before appearing throughout programs (except during commercial breaks) beginning in the [[1995\u201396 United States network television schedule|1995\u201396 season]]; the respective iterations of the translucent logo bug were also incorporated within program promotions until the 2011\u201312 season.\n\nDuring the 1997\u201398 season, the network began using a minimalist graphical identity with a yellow and black motif, designed by Pittard Sullivan, featuring a small black-and-white \"ABC Circle\" logo on a yellow background (promotions during this time also featured a sequence of still photos of the stars of its programs during the timeslot card as well as the schedule sequence that began each night's prime time lineup).<ref name=\"logo evolution\"/> A new four-note theme tune was introduced alongside the package, based around the network's then-new \"We Love TV\" image campaign from the 1998\u201399 season, creating an audio signature on par with the [[NBC chimes]], CBS' various three-note soundmarks (including the current version introduced in 1992) and the [[20th Century Fox#Logo and fanfare|Fox Fanfare]]. The four-note signature has been updated with every television season thereafter (though variants of it remain in use during the production company vanity cards shown following the closing credits of most programs).\n\nIn 2000, ABC launched a web-based promotional campaign focused around its circle logo, also called \"the dot\", in which comic book character [[Little Dot]] prompted visitors to \"download the dot\", a program which would cause the ABC logo to fly around the screen and settle in the bottom-right corner.<ref name=\"NYTimes\">{{cite news|title=ABC tries to bring its longtime 'dot' logo into prominence with a new campaign|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/10/02/business/media-business-advertising-abc-tries-bring-its-longtime-dot-logo-into-prominence.html|author=Stuart Elliott|newspaper=The New York Times|date=October 2, 2000}}</ref> The network hired the Troika Design Group to design and produce its 2001\u201302 identity, which continued using the black-and-yellow coloring of the logo and featured dots and stripes in various promotional and identification spots.<ref name=\"InsideDesign\">{{cite book|title=Inside design now: National Design Triennial|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Qg4RSmCw4UQC&pg=PA180&dq=abc+circle+logo+%22paul+rand%22&q=abc%20circle%20logo%20%22paul%20rand%22|author=Ellen Lupton|page=180|isbn=9781568983950|date=March 1, 2003|author-link = Ellen Lupton}}</ref>\n\nOn June 16, 2007, ABC began to phase in a new imaging campaign for the upcoming 2007\u201308 season, \"Start Here\". Also developed by Troika, the on-air design was intended to emphasize the availability of ABC content across multiple platforms (in particular, using a system of icons representing different devices, such as television, computers and mobile devices), and \"simplify and bring a lot more consistency and continuity to the visual representation of ABC\". The ABC logo was also significantly redesigned as part of the transition, with a glossy \"ball\" effect that was specifically designed for HD. On-air, the logo was accompanied by animated water and ribbon effects. Red ribbons were used to represent the entertainment division, while blue ribbons were used for ABC News.<ref name=\"abcnews-starthere\"/><ref name=tvw-starthere>{{cite web|title=ABC's New Graphic Cue Promotes Brand Across Platforms|url=http://www.tvweek.com/news/2007/09/abcs_new_graphic_cue_promotes.php/|work=TV Week|accessdate=March 24, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140324231418/http://www.tvweek.com/news/2007/09/abcs_new_graphic_cue_promotes.php/|archive-date=March 24, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nA revised version of the ABC logo was introduced for promotions for the 2013\u201314 season during the network's [[Upfront (advertising)|upfront]] presentation on May 14, 2013, and officially introduced on-air on May 30 (although some affiliates implemented the new design prior to then), as part of an overhaul of ABC's identity by design agency LoyalKaspar.

A new custom [[typeface]] inspired by the ABC logotype, \"ABC Modern\", was also created for use in advertising and other promotional materials.

This logo was intended to be used somewhat interchangeably by these stations with the main circular network logo and has itself also become an iconic symbol of the ABC network.  KGO was the first of the ABC-owned stations to use the Circle 7 logo, starting on August 27, 1962; by the end of the year, the other ABC-owned stations began using the logo, and have continued to do so since.\n\n==International development==\nThe first attempts to internationalize the ABC television network date back to the 1950s, after Leonard Goldenson, following the United Paramount Theatres model, tried to use on ABC the same strategies he had made in expanding UPT's theater operation to the international market.{{Sfn|Goldenson|Wolf|1991\u20131993|p=214}} Leonard Goldenson said that ABC's first international activity was broadcasting the coronation of [[Queen Elizabeth II]] in June 1953; CBS and NBC were delayed in covering the coronation due to flight delays.{{Sfn|Goldenson|Wolf|1991\u20131993|pp=215\u2013216}}<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/53-OCR/BC-1953-06-08-OCR-Page-0056.pdf|title=Networks Vie for \"First\" Honors As Radio-TV Cover the Coronation|last=|first=|date=June 8, 1953|work=Broadcasting/Telecasting|access-date=October 6, 2017}}</ref> Goldenson tried international investing, having ABC invest in stations in the Latin American market, acquiring a 51% interest in a network covering [[Central America]] and in 1959 established program distributor [[Worldvision Enterprises]]{{Sfn|Goldenson|Wolf|1991\u20131993|p=217}} Goldenson also cited interest in Japan in the early 1950s,{{Sfn|Goldenson|Wolf|1991\u20131993|p=221}} acquiring a 5% stake in two new domestic networks, the [[Mainichi Broadcasting System]] in 1951 and [[Nihon Educational Television]] in 1957.{{Sfn|Goldenson|Wolf|1991\u20131993|p=221}} Goldenson also invested in broadcasting properties in [[Beirut]] in the mid-1960s.{{Sfn|Goldenson|Wolf|1991\u20131993|p=223}}\n\nThe idea was to create a network of wholly and partially owned channels, and affiliates to rebroadcast the network's programs. In 1959, this rerun activity was completed with program syndication, with ABC Films selling programs to networks not owned by ABC.{{Sfn|Goldenson|Wolf|1991\u20131993|p=227}} The arrival of satellite television ended the need for ABC to hold interests in other countries;{{Sfn|Goldenson|Wolf|1991\u20131993|p=231}} many governments also wanted to increase their independence and strengthen legislation to limit foreign ownership of broadcasting properties. As a result, ABC was forced to sell all of its interests in international networks, mainly in Japan and Latin America, in the 1970s.{{Sfn|Goldenson|Wolf|1991\u20131993|p=232}}\n\nThe second period of international expansion is linked to that of the ESPN network in the 1990s, and policies enacted in the 2000s by Disney Media Networks (which included the expansion of several of the company's U.S.-based cable networks including Disney Channel and its spinoffs Toon Disney, [[Playhouse Disney]] and [[Jetix]]; although Disney also sold its 33% stake in European sports channel [[Eurosport]] for $155 million in June 2000<ref name=\"Annual 2000 p65\">{{cite web|title=Disney Annual Report 2000|url=http://corporate.disney.go.com/investors/annual_reports/2000/pdfs/financial.pdf|publisher=The Walt Disney Company|page=65}}</ref>). In contrast to Disney's other channels, ABC is broadcast in the United States, although the network's programming is syndicated in many countries. The policy regarding wholly owned international networks was revived in 2004 when on September 27 of that year, ABC announced the launch of [[ABC1 (UK)|ABC1]], a [[free-to-air]] channel in the United

The network is headquartered in [[Burbank, California]], on Riverside Drive, directly across the street from [[Walt Disney Studios (Burbank)|Walt Disney Studios]] and adjacent to the Roy E. Disney Animation Building. The network's secondary offices, and headquarters of its news division, is in [[New York City]], at its broadcast center at 77 [[66th Street (Manhattan)|West 66th Street]] on the [[Upper West Side, Manhattan|Upper West Side]] of [[Manhattan]].\n\nSince 2007, when [[Cumulus Media Networks|ABC Radio]] (also known as Cumulus Media Networks) was sold to [[Citadel Broadcasting]], ABC has reduced its broadcasting operations almost exclusively to television. It is the fifth-oldest major broadcasting network in the world and the youngest of the [[Big Three television networks]]. ABC is nicknamed \"'''The Alphabet Network'''\", as its [[initialism]] also represents the first three letters of the [[English alphabet]], in order.<ref>https://variety.com/2016/digital/news/abc-free-streaming-app-7-abcd-originals-1201813330/</ref>\n\nABC launched as a [[radio network]] in 1943, which served as the successor to the [[Blue Network|NBC Blue Network]], which had been purchased by [[Edward John Noble|Edward J. Noble]]. It extended its operations to television in 1948, following in the footsteps of established broadcast networks [[CBS]] and [[NBC]]. In the mid-1950s, ABC merged with [[American Broadcasting-Paramount Theatres|United Paramount Theatres]], a chain of movie theaters that formerly operated as a subsidiary of [[Paramount Pictures]]. [[Leonard Goldenson]], who had been the head of UPT, made the new television network profitable by helping develop and greenlight many successful series. In the 1980s, after purchasing an 80 percent interest in cable sports channel [[ESPN]], the network's corporate parent, American Broadcasting Companies, Inc., merged with [[Capital Cities/ABC Inc.|Capital Cities Communications]], owner of several print publications, and television and radio stations. In 1996, most of Capital Cities/ABC's assets were purchased by Disney.\n\nABC has eight [[owned-and-operated station|owned-and-operated]] and over 232 [[network affiliate|affiliated]] television stations throughout the United States and its territories. Some ABC-affiliated stations can also be seen in Canada via pay-television providers, and certain other affiliates can also be received over-the-air in areas near the [[Canada\u2013United States border]]. [[ABC News]] provides news and features content for select radio stations owned by [[Cumulus Media]], as these stations are former ABC Radio properties.\n\n==History==\n\n===Blue Network (1927\u20131945)===\n{{main|Blue Network}}\nIn the 1930s, radio in the United States was dominated by three companies: the [[CBS|Columbia Broadcasting System]] (CBS), the [[Mutual Broadcasting System]], and the [[NBC|National Broadcasting Company]] (NBC). The last was owned by electronics manufacturer [[RCA|Radio Corporation of America]] (RCA), which owned two radio networks that each ran different varieties of programming, [[Blue Network|NBC Blue]] and [[NBC Radio Network|NBC Red]]. The NBC Blue Network was created in 1927 for the primary purpose of testing new programs on markets of lesser importance than those served by NBC Red, which served the major cities,{{Sfn|Goldenson|Wolf|1991\u20131993|p=96}} and to test drama series.{{Sfn|Sterling|2004|p=291}}\n\nIn 1934, Mutual filed a complaint with the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) regarding its difficulties in establishing new stations, in a radio market that was already being saturated by NBC and CBS.{{Sfn|Sterling|2004|p=291}} In 1938, the FCC began a series of investigations into the practices of radio networks{{Sfn|Sterling|2004|p=291}} and published its report on the broadcasting of network radio programs in 1940. The report recommended that RCA give up control of either NBC Red or NBC Blue.{{Sfn|Goldenson|Wolf|1991\u20131993|p=96}} At that time, the NBC Red Network was the principal radio network in the United States and, according to the FCC, RCA was using NBC Blue to eliminate any hint of competition. Having no power over the networks themselves, the FCC established a regulation forbidding licenses to be issued for radio stations if they were affiliated with a network which already owned multiple networks{{Sfn|Goldenson|Wolf|1991\u20131993|p=96}} that provided content of public interest.{{Sfn|Sterling|2004|p=291}}\n\n[[File:Edward J.

Goldenson added to the confusion when, in October 1954,{{Sfn|Long|1979|p=110}} he proposed a merger between UPT and the DuMont Television Network, which was also mired in financial trouble.{{Sfn|Goldenson|Wolf|1991\u20131993|p=104}} As part of this merger, the network would have been renamed \"ABC-DuMont\" for five years, and DuMont would have received $5 million in cash, room on the schedule for existing DuMont programming, and guaranteed advertising time for DuMont Laboratories receivers.{{Sfn|Goldenson|Wolf|1991\u20131993|p=104}} In addition, to comply with FCC ownership restrictions, it would have been required to sell either WABC-TV or DuMont owned-and-operated station WABD in the New York City market, as well as two other stations.{{Sfn|Goldenson|Wolf|1991\u20131993|p=104}} The merged ABC-DuMont would have had the resources to compete with CBS and NBC.{{Sfn|Long|1979|p=110}}\n\nGoldenson sought to develop the ABC television network by trying to convince local stations to agree to affiliate with the network.{{Sfn|Goldenson|Wolf|1991\u20131993|p=104}} In doing this, he contacted local entrepreneurs who owned television stations themselves, many of whom had previously invested in Paramount cinemas and had worked with him when he undertook the responsibility of restructuring United Paramount Theatres.{{Sfn|Goldenson|Wolf|1991\u20131993|p=104}}\n\n====Hollywood begins to produce television series====\nAt the same time he made attempts to help grow ABC, Goldenson had been trying since mid-1953 to provide content for the network by contacting his old acquaintances in Hollywood, with whom he had worked when UPT was a subsidiary of Paramount Pictures.{{Sfn|Goldenson|Wolf|1991\u20131993|p=104}} ABC's merger with UPT led to the creation of relationships with Hollywood's film production studios, breaking a quarantine that had existed at that time between film and television,{{Sfn|Baughman|Atack|1983|p=58}} the latter of which had previously been more connected to radio. ABC's flagship productions at the time were ''[[The Lone Ranger (TV series)|The Lone Ranger]]'', based on the radio program of the same title, and ''[[The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet]]'', the latter of which (at 14 seasons, running from 1952 to 1966) held the record for the longest-running prime time comedy in U.S. television history, until it was surpassed by ''[[The Simpsons]]'' in 2003.\n\nGoldenson's efforts paid off, and on October 27, 1954, the network launched a campaign ushering in the \"New ABC\", with productions from several studios, including [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], [[Warner Bros.]] and [[20th Century Fox]].{{Sfn|Boddy|1992|pp=147\u2013148}}\n\nWarner tried with mixed success to adapt some of its most successful films as ABC television series, and showcase these adaptations as part of the [[wheel series]] ''[[Warner Bros.

Most markets outside the largest ones were not large enough to support three full-time network affiliates. In some markets that were large enough for a third full-time affiliate, the only available commercial allocation was on the less-desirable [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] band. Until the [[All-Channel Receiver Act]] (passed by Congress in 1961) mandated the inclusion of UHF tuning, most viewers needed to purchase a converter to be able to watch UHF stations, and the signal quality was marginal at best even with a converter. Additionally, during the analog television era, UHF stations were not adequately receivable in markets that either covered large areas or had rugged terrain. These factors made many prospective station owners skittish about investing in a UHF station, especially one that would have had to take on an affiliation with a weaker network.\n\nAs a result, with the exception of the largest markets, ABC was relegated to secondary status on one or both of the existing stations, usually via off-hours clearances (a notable exception during this time was WKST-TV in [[Youngstown, Ohio]], now [[WYTV]], despite the small size of the surrounding market and its close proximity to [[Cleveland]] and [[Pittsburgh]] even decades before [[Economy of Youngstown, Ohio#Black Monday|the city's economic collapse]]). According to Goldenson, this meant that an hour of ABC programming reported five times lower viewership than its competitors.{{Sfn|Goldenson|Wolf|1991\u20131993|p=116}} The network's intake of money at the time would allow it to accelerate its content production. Still, ABC's limited reach would continue to hobble it for the next two decades. Several smaller markets would not grow large enough to support a full-time ABC affiliate until the 1960s, with some very small markets having to wait as late as the 1980s or even the advent of [[digital terrestrial television|digital television]] in the 2000s, which allowed stations like [[WTRF-TV]] in [[Wheeling, West Virginia]], to begin airing ABC programming on a [[digital subchannel]] after relegating the network to off-hours clearances decades before.\n\nThe DuMont Television Network ceased broadcasting on September 15, 1955,{{Sfn|Long|1979|p=110}} and went bankrupt the next year. ABC then found itself as the third U.S. television network, dubbed the \"little third network\",{{Sfn|Smith|1998|p=151}} but still continued to look for successful programming. That same year, Kintner was forced to resign due to disagreements between Noble and Goldenson,{{Sfn|Goldenson|Wolf|1991\u20131993|p=104}} a consequence of Goldenson's many interventions in ABC's management.{{Sfn|Wittebols|2004|p=22}}\n\n====Counterprogramming: successful, but criticized====\n[[File:American Bandstand 50th reunion.jpg|thumb|right|In 2002, dancers and other cast members from the 32-year run of ''American Bandstand'' reunited with host [[Dick Clark]] to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the show's local television debut.]]\nIt was not until the late 1950s that the ABC network became a serious contender to NBC and CBS, and this was in large part due to the diverse range of programming that met the expectations of the public, such as westerns and detective series.<!--missing source: {{Sfn|Baughman|1979|p=57}}--> Despite an almost 500% increase in advertising revenues between 1953 and 1958, the network only had a national reach of between 10% and 18% of the total U.S. population, as it still had relatively fewer affiliates than NBC and CBS.{{Sfn|Boddy|1992|p=147}} In 1957, ABC Entertainment president Ollie Trez discovered that the locally produced variety show ''Bandstand'' had pulled very strong ratings in the Philadelphia market on WFIL-TV; Trez ultimately negotiated a deal to take the show national, under the revised title ''[[American Bandstand]]'';{{Sfn|Goldenson|Wolf|1991\u20131993|pp=161\u2013163}} the show quickly became a social phenomenon by presenting new musical talent and dances to America's youth{{Sfn|Goldenson|Wolf|1991\u20131993|pp=161\u2013163}} and helped make a star out of its host, Dick Clark.\n\nOn September 3, 1958, the ''Disneyland'' anthology series was retitled ''Walt Disney Presents''{{Sfn|Smith|1998|p=152}} as it became disassociated with the theme park of the same name. The movement in westerns, which ABC is credited for having started, represented a fifth of all primetime series on American television in January 1959, at which point detective shows were beginning to rise in popularity as well.{{Sfn|Baughman|Atack|1983|p=59}} ABC requested additional productions from Disney.{{Sfn|Cotter|1997|p=66}} In late 1958, [[Desilu Productions]] pitched its detective series ''[[The Untouchables (1959 TV series)|The Untouchables]]'' Starring [[Robert Stack]] to CBS; after that network rejected the show because of its use of violence, Desilu then presented it to ABC, which agreed to pick up the show,{{Sfn|Baughman|Atack|1983|p=63}} and debuted ''The Untouchables'' in April 1959. The series went on to quickly become \"immensely popular\".{{Sfn|Baughman|Atack|1983|p=63}}\n\nThese kinds of programs presented ABC with an image of the \"philosophy of counterprogramming against its competitors\", offering a strong lineup of programs that contrasted with those seen on its rival networks,{{Sfn|Cotter|1997|p=66}} which helped Goldenson give the network a continuum between film and television.{{Sfn|Baughman|Atack|1983|p=60}} ABC's western series (as well as series such as the actioner ''[[Zorro (1957 TV series)|Zorro]]'') went up against and defeated the variety shows aired by NBC and CBS in the fall of 1957, and its detective shows did the same in the fall of 1959.

The network's finances improved and allowed it to invest in other properties and programming. In May 1960, ABC purchased [[Farm Progress]], owner of Chicago radio station [[WLS (AM)|WLS]], which had shared airtime with WENR since the 1920s.{{Sfn|Childers|2008|p=8}} This acquisition allowed ABC to consolidate its presence in the market.

Also, in the summer of 1975, ABC discovered that its Cleveland affiliate [[WEWS-TV]] was producing its own morning program ''[[The Morning Exchange]]'', which debuted in 1972 and was now locally pre-empting ''AM America''; it was the first morning show to utilize a set modeled after a [[living room]], and established a concept now commonplace among network morning shows in which news and weather updates were featured at the top and bottom of each hour. Discovering that their formats seemed to appeal to their viewers,{{Sfn|Goldenson|Wolf|1991\u20131993|p=353}} the network became the first to adopt them for a new national morning show, ''[[Good Morning America]]'', which debuted on November 3, 1975.{{Sfn|Goldenson|Wolf|1991\u20131993|p=353}}\n\nThe 1970s were highlighted by several successful comedy, fantasy, action and superhero-themed series for the network including ''[[Kung Fu (TV series)|Kung Fu]]'', ''[[The Six Million Dollar Man]]'', ''[[Wonder Woman (TV series)|Wonder Woman]]'', ''[[Starsky & Hutch]]'', ''[[Charlie's Angels]]'', ''[[The Bionic Woman]]'', ''[[Fantasy Island]]'' and ''[[Battlestar Galactica (1978 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]''. Many of these series were greenlit by Silverman, who left ABC in 1978 to become president of NBC's entertainment division. The rousing success of ''Happy Days'' also led to a successful spin-off series, ''[[Laverne & Shirley]]'', which debuted during the 1975\u201376 season. ''Charlie's Angels'' and ''[[Three's Company]]'' (which debuted during the 1976\u201377 season) were two prime examples of a trend among the major networks during the 1970s known as \"[[jiggle TV]]\", featuring attractive, often buxom, women in main and guest roles.\n\nIn 1977, Henry Plitt, who at the time was associated with Thomas Klutznick, a real estate entrepreneur in Chicago, purchased the southern division of ABC Theatres, ABC Southern.{{Sfn|Goldenson|Wolf|1991\u20131993|p=231}} The sale stripped ABC of control over its theaters as a result of changes in the theater operation sector, mainly the fact that the population was migrating to the suburbs and moving away from older cinemas in larger cities{{Sfn|Goldenson|Wolf|1991\u20131993|p=231}} ([[Plitt Theatres]] was later purchased by [[Cineplex Odeon Corporation]] in 1987{{Sfn|Goldenson|Wolf|1991\u20131993|p=231}}).\n\nFor its part, the television network produced a few new hits during 1977: January saw the premiere of ''[[Roots (1977 miniseries)|Roots]]'', a miniseries based on an [[Alex Haley]] [[Roots (novel)|novel]] that was published the previous year.

Meanwhile, a former parking lot, located at 30 West 67th Street, was transformed into an impressive 15-story building. Both buildings were completed in June 1979.

ABC also broadcasts the annual ''[[Disney Parks Christmas Day Parade]]'' special on Christmas morning.\n\nSince 1974, ABC has generally aired ''[[Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve]]''\u2014a [[New Year's Eve]] special featuring music performances and coverage of festivities in New York's [[Times Square Ball|Times Square]]. It was hosted first by its creator [[Dick Clark]], and later by his successor [[Ryan Seacrest]]. The only exception was in 1999, when ABC instead broadcast ''[[ABC 2000 Today]]''\u2014a day-long telecast produced by ABC News as part of the ''[[2000 Today]]'' consortium, which was hosted by [[Peter Jennings]] and covered festivities from around the world (Dick Clark would join Jennings to co-host coverage from Times Square).

Worldwide video rights are currently owned by various companies; for example, [[Kino Lorber]] owns the North American home video rights to the ABC feature film library (along with some lesser known live action films from Disney's library, mostly from [[Touchstone Pictures]], [[Hollywood Pictures]] and [[20th Century Fox]]).\n\nWhen the FCC imposed its [[Financial Interest and Syndication Rules|fin-syn]] rules in 1970, ABC proactively created two companies: Worldvision Enterprises as a syndication distributor, and ABC Circle Films as a production company. However, between the publication and implementation of these regulations, the separation of the network's catalog was made in 1973. The broadcast rights to pre-1973 productions were transferred to Worldvision, which became independent in the same year. The company has been sold several times since [[Paramount Television]] acquired it in 1999, and has most recently been absorbed into [[CBS Television Distribution]], a unit of [[CBS Corporation]]. Nonetheless, Worldvision sold portions of its catalog, including the [[Ruby-Spears]] and Hanna-Barbera libraries, to [[Turner Broadcasting System]] in 1991. With Disney's 1996 purchase of ABC, ABC Circle Films was absorbed into Touchstone Television, a Disney subsidiary which in turn was renamed ABC Studios in 2007.<ref name=\"WDC-ABC\"/>\n\nAlso part of the library are most films in the [[David O. Selznick]] library, the [[Cinerama Productions]]/Palomar theatrical library (with the exception of those films produced in Cinerama which are now under the control of [[Pacific Theatres]] and Flicker Alley), the Selmur Productions catalog that the network acquired some years back, and the in-house productions it continues to produce (such as ''[[America's Funniest Home Videos]]'', ''General Hospital'', ABC News productions, as well as series from [[ABC Studios]] and [[20th Century Fox Television]]), although [[Disney\u2013ABC Domestic Television]] (formerly known as Buena Vista Television) handles domestic television distribution, while [[Disney Media Distribution|Disney\u2013ABC International Television]] (formerly known as Buena Vista International Television) handles international television distribution.\n\n==Stations==\n{{Main|List of ABC television affiliates (by U.S. state)|List of ABC television affiliates (table)|ABC Owned Television Stations}} \n<!--- Please update station count in the below paragraph whenever the accompanying list referenced is updated. --->\nSince its inception, ABC has had many affiliated stations, which include WABC-TV and WPVI-TV, the first two stations to carry the network's programming. ABC has eight owned-and-operated stations, and current and pending affiliation agreements with 236 additional television stations encompassing 49 states, the District of Columbia, four U.S. possessions, Bermuda and [[Saba]];<ref name=re>{{cite web|title=Stations for Network \u2013 ABC|url=http://www.rabbitears.info/search.php?request=network_search&network=ABC|work=RabbitEars.info|accessdate=October 30, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"StationIndex\">{{cite web|title=Network Profile: ABC|url=http://www.stationindex.com/tv/by-net/abc|publisher=Station Index}}</ref> this makes ABC the largest U.S. broadcast television network by total number of affiliates. The network has an estimated national reach of 97.72% of all households in the United States (or 305,347,338 Americans with at least one television set).\n\nCurrently, [[New Jersey]], [[Rhode Island]], and [[Delaware]] are the only U.S. states where ABC does not have a locally licensed affiliate (New Jersey is served by New York City O&O WABC-TV in the north half of the state and Philadelphia O&O WPVI-TV in the south; Rhode Island is served by [[New Bedford, Massachusetts]]-licensed [[WLNE-TV|WLNE]], though outside of the transmitter, all other operations for the station are based in [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]]; and Delaware is served by WPVI and [[Salisbury, Maryland]], affiliate [[WMDT]]). ABC maintains affiliations with low-power stations (broadcasting either in analog or digital) in a few markets, such as [[Birmingham, Alabama]] ([[WBMA-LD]]), [[Lima, Ohio]] ([[WPNM-LP]]) and [[South Bend, Indiana]] ([[WBND-LD]]). In some markets, including the former two mentioned, these stations also maintain digital simulcasts on a subchannel of a co-owned/co-managed full-power television station.\n\nThe network has the unusual distinction of having separately owned and operated affiliates which serve the same market in [[Tampa, Florida]] (WFTS-TV and [[WWSB]]), [[Lincoln, Nebraska]] ([[KLKN-TV]] and [[KHGI-TV]]), and [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]] ([[WZZM]] and [[WOTV]]), with an analogous situation arising in [[Kansas City, Missouri]] ([[KMBC-TV]] and [[KQTV]]). KQTV is licensed to [[St. Joseph, Missouri]], which is designated by [[Nielsen Holdings|Nielsen]] as a separate market from Kansas City despite being located within {{convert|55|mi|km}} of one another (though in the 2010s through digital subchannels, KQTV's competitor in the market, [[News-Press & Gazette Company]], has established locally based affiliates of the other four major networks and [[Telemundo]] on three low-power stations to end St. Joseph's dependence on Kansas City; NPG itself proposed an acquisition of KQTV in April 2019, subject to FCC approval), while WWSB, KHGI and WOTV serve areas that do not receive an adequate signal from their market's primary ABC affiliate (in the case of WWSB, this dates back to when [[WTSP]] was Tampa's primary ABC affiliate prior to 1994, with the former being necessitated to serve the southern part of the Tampa market including the station's [[city of license]], [[Sarasota, Florida|Sarasota]], due to WTSP's transmitter being short-spaced to avoid interfering with the analog signal of [[Miami]] affiliate [[WPLG]] \u2013 which like WTSP, broadcast on VHF channel 10).\n\nThe [[Sinclair Broadcast Group]] is the largest operator of ABC stations by numerical total, owning or providing services to 28 full, primary ABC affiliates and two additional subchannel-only affiliates; Sinclair owns the largest ABC subchannel affiliate by market size, [[WABM|WABM-DT2]]/[[WTTO|WDBB-DT2]] in the Birmingham market, which serve as repeaters of WBMA-LD (which itself is also simulcast on a subchannel of former WBMA satellite [[WGWW]], owned by Sinclair partner company [[Howard Stirk Holdings]]). The E. W. Scripps Company is the largest operator of ABC stations in terms of overall market reach, owning 15 ABC-affiliated stations (including affiliates in larger markets such as [[WEWS|Cleveland]], [[KNXV-TV|Phoenix]], [[WXYZ-TV|Detroit]] and [[KMGH-TV|Denver]]), and through its ownership of [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] affiliate KNXV, [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] affiliate [[KTNV-TV]] and [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]] affiliate [[KGUN-TV]], it is the only provider of ABC programming for the majority of [[Arizona]] (outside the [[Yuma, Arizona|Yuma]]-[[El Centro, California|El Centro]] market) and [[Southern Nevada]].  Scripps also owns and operates several ABC stations in the Mountain and Pacific time zones, including in Denver, [[KGTV|San Diego]], [[KERO-TV|Bakersfield, California]], and [[KIVI-TV|Boise, Idaho]], and when combined with [[ABC Owned Television Stations|the ABC-owned stations]] in [[KABC-TV|Los Angeles]], [[KFSN-TV|Fresno]], and [[KGO-TV|San Francisco]], the affiliations from the News-Press & Gazette Company in [[KEYT-TV|Santa Barbara]], [[KESQ-TV|Palm Springs]], [[KECY-TV|Yuma-El Centro]], and [[KRDO-TV|Colorado Springs-Pueblo]], and Sinclair's affiliations in [[KOMO-TV|Seattle]] and [[KATU|Portland, Oregon]], these four entities control the access of ABC network programming in most of the Western United States, particularly in terms of audience reach.\n\n==Facilities and studios==\nAll of ABC's owned-and-operated stations and affiliates have had their own facilities and studios, but transverse entities have been created to produce national programming. As a result, television series were produced by ABC Circle Films beginning in 1962 and by Touchstone Television beginning in 1985, before Touchstone was reorganized as [[ABC Studios]] in February 2007. Since the 1950s, ABC has had two main production facilities: the ABC Television Center (now The Prospect Studios) on [[Hollywood Boulevard|Prospect Avenue]] in [[Hollywood, California]], shared with the operations of KABC-TV until 1999; and the ABC Television Center, East, a set of studios located throughout New York City.\n\nIn addition to the headquarters building on Riverside Drive, other ABC facilities in Burbank include a building at 3800 West Alameda, known as \"Burbank Center,\" which is primarily associated with [[Disney\u2013ABC Television Group]], and functions as the headquarters and broadcast center for [[Disney Junior]], [[Disney Channel]], [[Disney XD]], [[Freeform (TV channel)|FreeForm]], as well as [[Radio Disney]]. Additionally, [[Disney Television Animation]] has a facility on Empire Avenue near the [[Hollywood Burbank Airport]].  In nearby [[Glendale, California|Glendale]], Disney/ABC also maintains the [[Grand Central Airport (California)#Grand Central Creative Campus|Grand Central Creative Campus]], which houses other company subsidiaries, including the studios of KABC-TV and the Los Angeles bureau of ABC News.\n\nABC owns several facilities in New York grouped mainly on West 66th Street. The main set of facilities is on the corner of Columbus Avenue and West 66th Street. In total, ABC's facilities occupy a combined {{convert|9755|m\u00b2|sqft|sp=us}} of the {{convert|14864|m\u00b2|sqft|sp=us}} of the blocks they encompass.

Similar to sister network ESPN's [[WatchESPN]] service, live streams of ABC stations are only available to [[TV Everywhere|authenticated subscribers of participating pay television providers]] in certain markets. New York City O&O WABC-TV and Philadelphia O&O WPVI-TV were the first stations to offer streams of their programming on the service (with a [[free preview]] for non-subscribers through June 2013), with the six remaining ABC O&Os offering streams by the start of the 2013\u201314 season. [[Hearst Television]] also reached a deal to offer streams of its ABC affiliates (including stations in [[WCVB-TV|Boston]], [[KMBC-TV|Kansas City]], [[WISN-TV|Milwaukee]] and [[WPBF-TV|West Palm Beach]]) on the service, though {{as of|2016|lc=y}} these stations are only available for live-streaming for [[DirecTV]] subscribers.<ref name=variety-watchabc>{{cite news|title=ABC to Stream Live Via App|url=https://variety.com/2013/tv/news/abc-to-stream-live-via-app-1200479778/|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|accessdate=June 1, 2013}}</ref><ref name=engadget-watchabc>{{cite web|title=Watch ABC app with live TV streaming comes to Kindle Fire, but not Google Play|url=https://www.engadget.com/2013/05/31/watch-abc-app-kindle-fire/|work=[[Engadget]]|date=May 31, 2013|accessdate=June 1, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn November 2015, it was reported that ABC had been developing a slate of original digital series for the WatchABC service, internally codenamed \"ABC3\", with one series set to feature [[Iliza Shlesinger]].<ref name=\"Variety-abc3slate\">{{cite news|last1=Wallenstein|first1=Andrew|title=ABC Lines Up Original Series for New Streaming Effort|url=https://variety.com/2015/digital/news/abc-lines-up-original-series-for-new-streaming-effort-exclusive-1201638884/|accessdate=August 1, 2016|work=Variety|date=November 12, 2015}}</ref> In July 2016, ABC re-launched its streaming platforms, dropping the \"WatchABC\" brand, adding a streaming library of 38 classic ABC series, as well as introducing seven original short-form series under the blanket branding ''ABCd''.<ref name=\"variety-abcapp\">{{cite news|last1=Spangler |first1=Todd |title=With 7 Short-Form Originals, Full Seasons of 38 Older Shows|url=https://variety.com/2016/digital/news/abc-free-streaming-app-7-abcd-originals-1201813330/|accessdate=August 1, 2016|work=Variety|date=}}</ref>\n\nThe most recent episodes of the network's shows are usually made available on the ABC app, Hulu and ABC on Demand the day after their original broadcast. In addition, ABC on Demand (like the video-on-demand television services provided by the other U.S. broadcast networks) disallows [[fast forward]]ing of accessed content. Restrictions implemented on January 7, 2014, restrict streaming of the most recent episode of any ABC program on Hulu and the ABC app until eight days after their initial broadcast, in order to encourage live or same-week (via both [[digital video recorder|DVR]] and cable on demand) viewing, with day-after-air streaming on either service limited to subscribers of participating pay television providers (such as [[Comcast]], [[Verizon FiOS]] and [[Time Warner Cable]]) using an [[Internet service provider|ISP]] account via an authenticated user login.\n\n===ABC HD===\n[[File:ABC HD logo.svg|upright=|thumb|left|Logo for ABC HD.]]\nABC's network feeds are transmitted in [[720p]] [[high-definition television|high definition]], the native resolution format for The Walt Disney Company's U.S. television properties. However, most of Hearst Television's 16 ABC-affiliated stations transmit the network's programming in [[1080i]] HD, while 11 other affiliates owned by various companies carry the network feed in [[480i]] [[standard-definition television|standard definition]]<ref name=re/> either due to technical considerations for affiliates of other major networks that carry ABC programming on a digital subchannel or because a primary feed ABC affiliate has not yet upgraded their transmission equipment to allow content to be presented in HD.\n\nABC began its conversion to high definition with the launch of its simulcast feed, ABC HD, on September 16, 2001, at the start of the [[2001\u201302 United States network television schedule|2001\u201302 season]], with its scripted prime time series becoming the first shows to upgrade to the format. The network's slate of freshmen scripted series were broadcast in HD from their debuts, while all scripted series held over from the [[2000\u201301 United States network television schedule|2000\u201301 season]] were converted from standard-definition to high definition beginning that season.\n\nWith the 2011 cancellation of ''[[Supernanny]]'', ''[[Extreme Makeover: Home Edition]]'' became the only remaining program on the network's schedule that was broadcast in [[4:3]] standard definition. All of the network's programming has been presented in HD since January 2012 (with the exception of certain [[Christmas holiday season|holiday]] specials produced prior to 2005 \u2013 such as the ''Peanuts'' specials \u2013 which continue to be presented in 4:3 SD), when ''Extreme Makeover: Home Edition'' ended its run as a regular series and ''One Life to Live'' (which had been presented in [[16:9]] standard definition since 2010) also ended its ABC run. The affiliate-syndicated Saturday morning E/I block ''Litton's Weekend Adventure'' is also broadcast in HD, and was the first children's program block on any U.S. broadcast network to feature programs available in the format upon its September 2011 debut.\n\nOn September 1, 2016, ABC began to use [[16:9]] framing for all of most graphical imaging (primarily the network's logo bug, in-program promotions and generic closing credit sequences as well as sports telecasts, where the BottomLine and scoreboard elements now extend outside the 4:3 frame), requiring its stations and pay television providers to display its programming in a compulsory [[widescreen]] format, either in high definition or standard definition; with the change, some programs (such as ''Grey's Anatomy'', ''The Goldbergs'' and ''Quantico'') also began positioning their main on-screen credits outside the 4:3 aspect ratio. This left [[CBS]] and [[The CW]] as the last two major networks to continue to prefer 4:3 framing for graphics, with CBS converting to 16:9 framing effective September 24, 2018.\n\n==Visual identity==\n[[File:American Broadcasting Company Logo.svg|thumb|right|upright=.682|The \"ABC Circle\" logo, designed by [[Paul Rand]] in 1962]]\nThe ABC logo has evolved many times since the network's creation in 1943. The network's first logo, introduced in 1946, consisted of a television screen containing the letters \"T\" and \"V\", with a vertical ''ABC'' microphone in the center,<ref name=\"logo evolution\">{{cite web|title=The Evolution of ABC |url=http://members.fortunecity.com/tvnetworks/abc/ |publisher=TV Network Extravaganza |accessdate=November 20, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331214424/http://members.fortunecity.com/tvnetworks/abc/ |archivedate=March 31, 2012 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> referencing the network's roots in radio. When the ABC-UPT merger was finalized in 1953, the network introduced a new logo based on the seal of the Federal Communications Commission, with the letters \"ABC\" enclosed in a circular [[Heraldry|shield]] surmounted by the [[bald eagle]].<ref name=\"logo evolution\"/> In 1957, just before the television network began its first color broadcasts, the ABC logo consisted of a tiny lowercase \"abc\" in the center of a large lowercase letter ''a'', a design known as the \"ABC Circle A\".<ref name=\"logo evolution\"/>\n\nIn 1962, graphic designer Paul Rand redesigned the ABC logo into its best-known (and current) form, with the lowercase letters \"abc\" enclosed in a single black circle. The new logo debuted on-air for ABC's promos at the start of the 1963\u201364 season. The letters are strongly reminiscent of the [[Bauhaus (typeface)|Bauhaus]] typeface designed by [[Herbert Bayer]] in the 1920s,{{Sfn|Gernsheimer|2010|p=43}} but also share similarities with several other fonts, such as [[ITC Avant Garde]] and Horatio, and most closely resembling Chalet. The logo's simplicity made it easier to redesign and duplicate, which conferred a benefit for ABC (mostly before the advent of [[computer graphics]]). A color version of this logo was also developed around 1963, and animated as a brief 10-second intro to be shown before the then-small handful of network programs broadcast in color (similar to the NBC \"Laramie\" peacock intro used during that era). The \"a\" was rendered in red, the \"b\" in blue, and the \"c\" in green, against the same single black circle. A variant of this color logo, with the colored letters against a white circle, was also commonly used throughout the 1960s.\n\nThe 1970s and 1980s saw the emergence of many graphical imaging packages for the network which based the logo's setting mainly on special lighting effects then under development including white, blue, pink, rainbow neon and glittering dotted lines. Among the \"ABC Circle\" logo's many variants was a 1977 ID sequence that featured a bubble on a black background representing the circle with glossy gold letters, and as such, was the first ABC identification card to have a three-dimensional appearance.<ref name=\"logo evolution\"/>\n\nIn 1983, for the 40th anniversary of the network's founding, ID sequences had the logo appear in a gold [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] design on a blue background, accompanied by the slogan \"That Special Feeling\" in a script font.<ref name=\"logo evolution\"/> Ten years later, in 1993, the \"ABC Circle\" logo reverted to its classic white-on-black color scheme, but with gloss effects on both the circle and the letters, and a bronze border surrounding the circle.<ref name=\"logo evolution\"/> The ABC logo first appeared as an [[digital on-screen graphic|on-screen bug]] in the [[1993\u201394 United States network television schedule|1993\u201394 season]], appearing initially only for 60 seconds at the beginning of an act or segment, before appearing throughout programs (except during commercial breaks) beginning in the [[1995\u201396 United States network television schedule|1995\u201396 season]]; the respective iterations of the translucent logo bug were also incorporated within program promotions until the 2011\u201312 season.\n\nDuring the 1997\u201398 season, the network began using a minimalist graphical identity with a yellow and black motif, designed by Pittard Sullivan, featuring a small black-and-white \"ABC Circle\" logo on a yellow background (promotions during this time also featured a sequence of still photos of the stars of its programs during the timeslot card as well as the schedule sequence that began each night's prime time lineup).<ref name=\"logo evolution\"/> A new four-note theme tune was introduced alongside the package, based around the network's then-new \"We Love TV\" image campaign from the 1998\u201399 season, creating an audio signature on par with the [[NBC chimes]], CBS' various three-note soundmarks (including the current version introduced in 1992) and the [[20th Century Fox#Logo and fanfare|Fox Fanfare]]. The four-note signature has been updated with every television season thereafter (though variants of it remain in use during the production company vanity cards shown following the closing credits of most programs).\n\nIn 2000, ABC launched a web-based promotional campaign focused around its circle logo, also called \"the dot\", in which comic book character [[Little Dot]] prompted visitors to \"download the dot\", a program which would cause the ABC logo to fly around the screen and settle in the bottom-right corner.<ref name=\"NYTimes\">{{cite news|title=ABC tries to bring its longtime 'dot' logo into prominence with a new campaign|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/10/02/business/media-business-advertising-abc-tries-bring-its-longtime-dot-logo-into-prominence.html|author=Stuart Elliott|newspaper=The New York Times|date=October 2, 2000}}</ref> The network hired the Troika Design Group to design and produce its 2001\u201302 identity, which continued using the black-and-yellow coloring of the logo and featured dots and stripes in various promotional and identification spots.<ref name=\"InsideDesign\">{{cite book|title=Inside design now: National Design Triennial|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Qg4RSmCw4UQC&pg=PA180&dq=abc+circle+logo+%22paul+rand%22&q=abc%20circle%20logo%20%22paul%20rand%22|author=Ellen Lupton|page=180|isbn=9781568983950|date=March 1, 2003|author-link = Ellen Lupton}}</ref>\n\nOn June 16, 2007, ABC began to phase in a new imaging campaign for the upcoming 2007\u201308 season, \"Start Here\". Also developed by Troika, the on-air design was intended to emphasize the availability of ABC content across multiple platforms (in particular, using a system of icons representing different devices, such as television, computers and mobile devices), and \"simplify and bring a lot more consistency and continuity to the visual representation of ABC\". The ABC logo was also significantly redesigned as part of the transition, with a glossy \"ball\" effect that was specifically designed for HD. On-air, the logo was accompanied by animated water and ribbon effects. Red ribbons were used to represent the entertainment division, while blue ribbons were used for ABC News.<ref name=\"abcnews-starthere\"/><ref name=tvw-starthere>{{cite web|title=ABC's New Graphic Cue Promotes Brand Across Platforms|url=http://www.tvweek.com/news/2007/09/abcs_new_graphic_cue_promotes.php/|work=TV Week|accessdate=March 24, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140324231418/http://www.tvweek.com/news/2007/09/abcs_new_graphic_cue_promotes.php/|archive-date=March 24, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nA revised version of the ABC logo was introduced for promotions for the 2013\u201314 season during the network's [[Upfront (advertising)|upfront]] presentation on May 14, 2013, and officially introduced on-air on May 30 (although some affiliates implemented the new design prior to then), as part of an overhaul of ABC's identity by design agency LoyalKaspar.

A new custom [[typeface]] inspired by the ABC logotype, \"ABC Modern\", was also created for use in advertising and other promotional materials.

This logo was intended to be used somewhat interchangeably by these stations with the main circular network logo and has itself also become an iconic symbol of the ABC network.  KGO was the first of the ABC-owned stations to use the Circle 7 logo, starting on August 27, 1962; by the end of the year, the other ABC-owned stations began using the logo, and have continued to do so since.\n\n==International development==\nThe first attempts to internationalize the ABC television network date back to the 1950s, after Leonard Goldenson, following the United Paramount Theatres model, tried to use on ABC the same strategies he had made in expanding UPT's theater operation to the international market.{{Sfn|Goldenson|Wolf|1991\u20131993|p=214}} Leonard Goldenson said that ABC's first international activity was broadcasting the coronation of [[Queen Elizabeth II]] in June 1953; CBS and NBC were delayed in covering the coronation due to flight delays.{{Sfn|Goldenson|Wolf|1991\u20131993|pp=215\u2013216}}<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/53-OCR/BC-1953-06-08-OCR-Page-0056.pdf|title=Networks Vie for \"First\" Honors As Radio-TV Cover the Coronation|last=|first=|date=June 8, 1953|work=Broadcasting/Telecasting|access-date=October 6, 2017}}</ref> Goldenson tried international investing, having ABC invest in stations in the Latin American market, acquiring a 51% interest in a network covering [[Central America]] and in 1959 established program distributor [[Worldvision Enterprises]]{{Sfn|Goldenson|Wolf|1991\u20131993|p=217}} Goldenson also cited interest in Japan in the early 1950s,{{Sfn|Goldenson|Wolf|1991\u20131993|p=221}} acquiring a 5% stake in two new domestic networks, the [[Mainichi Broadcasting System]] in 1951 and [[Nihon Educational Television]] in 1957.{{Sfn|Goldenson|Wolf|1991\u20131993|p=221}} Goldenson also invested in broadcasting properties in [[Beirut]] in the mid-1960s.{{Sfn|Goldenson|Wolf|1991\u20131993|p=223}}\n\nThe idea was to create a network of wholly and partially owned channels, and affiliates to rebroadcast the network's programs. In 1959, this rerun activity was completed with program syndication, with ABC Films selling programs to networks not owned by ABC.{{Sfn|Goldenson|Wolf|1991\u20131993|p=227}} The arrival of satellite television ended the need for ABC to hold interests in other countries;{{Sfn|Goldenson|Wolf|1991\u20131993|p=231}} many governments also wanted to increase their independence and strengthen legislation to limit foreign ownership of broadcasting properties. As a result, ABC was forced to sell all of its interests in international networks, mainly in Japan and Latin America, in the 1970s.{{Sfn|Goldenson|Wolf|1991\u20131993|p=232}}\n\nThe second period of international expansion is linked to that of the ESPN network in the 1990s, and policies enacted in the 2000s by Disney Media Networks (which included the expansion of several of the company's U.S.-based cable networks including Disney Channel and its spinoffs Toon Disney, [[Playhouse Disney]] and [[Jetix]]; although Disney also sold its 33% stake in European sports channel [[Eurosport]] for $155 million in June 2000<ref name=\"Annual 2000 p65\">{{cite web|title=Disney Annual Report 2000|url=http://corporate.disney.go.com/investors/annual_reports/2000/pdfs/financial.pdf|publisher=The Walt Disney Company|page=65}}</ref>). In contrast to Disney's other channels, ABC is broadcast in the United States, although the network's programming is syndicated in many countries. The policy regarding wholly owned international networks was revived in 2004 when on September 27 of that year, ABC announced the launch of [[ABC1 (UK)|ABC1]], a [[free-to-air]] channel in the United

The fruit frogs grow as large as {{convert|30|cm|in}} long and {{convert|15|cm|in|0}} in diameter, and it typically weighs one to three&nbsp;kilograms (2 to 7&nbsp;lb). Its shape ranges from oblong to round, the colour of its husk green to brown, and its flesh pale yellow to red, depending on the species.\n\nSome people regard the durian as having a pleasantly sweet fragrance, whereas others find the aroma overpowering with an unpleasant odour. The smell evokes reactions from deep appreciation to intense disgust, and has been described variously as rotten onions, [[turpentine]], and raw sewage. The persistence of its odour, which may linger for several days, has led to the fruit's banishment from certain hotels and public transportation in southeast Asia. By contrast, the nineteenth-century British [[Natural history|naturalist]] [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] described its flesh as \"a rich [[custard]] highly flavoured with [[almond]]s\". The flesh can be consumed at various stages of ripeness, and it is used to flavour a wide variety of savoury and sweet desserts in [[Asian cuisine|southeast Asian cuisines]]. The seeds can also be eaten when cooked.\n\n==Etymology==\nFirst used around 1580, the name \"durian\" is derived from the [[Old Malay language]] word ''d\u00fbr\u00ee'' (meaning 'thorn'),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.etymonline.com/search?q=durian|title=Durian|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary, Douglas Harper|date=2018|accessdate=18 August 2018}}</ref> a reference to the numerous prickly thorns\nof the rind, together with the noun-building suffix ''-an''.<ref>{{cite dictionary| title = Durian| dictionary = Dictionary.com|url=https://www.dictionary.com/browse/durian?r=75?r=75 |date=2018|accessdate=18 August 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |quote=Via ''durion'', the Indonesia name for the plant. |title=Oxford English Dictionary |year=1897 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|title-link=Oxford English Dictionary }}</ref> The species name 'zibethinus' derives from the name of the [[civet]] (''Viverra zibetha''), known for its odour.<ref name=\"Husin\">{{cite journal | last=Husin | first=NA | last2=Rahman | first2=S | last3=Karunakaran | first3=R | last4=Bhore | first4=SJ | title=A review on the nutritional, medicinal, molecular and genome attributes of durian (''Durio zibethinus'' L.), the king of fruits in Malaysia | journal=Bioinformation | volume=14 | issue=6 | year=2018 | issn=0973-2063 | pmid=30237671 | pmc=6137565 | doi=10.6026/97320630014265 | pages=265\u2013270}}</ref>\n\n==Taxonomy==\n{{For|a complete list of known species of Durio|List of Durio species}}\n[[File:Durian flower.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Durian flowers are usually closed during the daytime]]\n\n''Durio sensu lato'' has 30 recognised species.<ref name=\"Brown\" /> ''Durio sensu stricto'' comprises 24 of these species.

His theory was that [[Zoochorous|endozoochory]] (the enticement of animals to transport seeds in their stomach) arose before any other method of [[Biological dispersal|seed dispersal]], and that primitive ancestors of ''Durio'' species were the earliest practitioners of that dispersal method, in particular red durian (''D. dulcis'') exemplifying the primitive fruit of flowering plants. However, in more recent circumscriptions of Durioneae, the tribe into which ''Durio'' and its sister taxa fall, fleshy arils and spiny fruits are derived within the clade. Some genera possess these characters, but others do not. The most recent molecular evidence (on which the most recent, well-supported circumscription of Durioneae is based) therefore refutes Corner's Durian Theory.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|title = Phylogenetic relationships of the durians (Bombacaceae-Durioneae or /Malvaceae/Helicteroideae/Durioneae) based on chloroplast and nuclear ribosomal DNA sequences|journal = Plant Systematics and Evolution|date = 2000-03-01|issn = 0378-2697|pages = 55\u201382|volume = 224|issue = 1\u20132|doi = 10.1007/BF00985266|first = R.|last = Nyffeler|first2 = D.

The fruit can grow as large as {{convert|30|cm|in}} long and {{convert|15|cm|in|0}} in diameter, and it typically weighs one to three&nbsp;kilograms (2 to 7&nbsp;lb). Its shape ranges from oblong to round, the colour of its husk green to brown, and its flesh pale yellow to red, depending on the species.\n\nSome people regard the durian as having a pleasantly sweet fragrance, whereas others find the aroma overpowering with an unpleasant odour. The smell evokes reactions from deep appreciation to intense disgust, and has been described variously as rotten onions, [[turpentine]], and raw sewage. The persistence of its odour, which may linger for several days, has led to the fruit's banishment from certain hotels and public transportation in southeast Asia. By contrast, the nineteenth-century British [[Natural history|naturalist]] [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] described its flesh as \"a rich [[custard]] highly flavoured with [[almond]]s\". The flesh can be consumed at various stages of ripeness, and it is used to flavour a wide variety of savoury and sweet desserts in [[Asian cuisine|southeast Asian cuisines]]. The seeds can also be eaten when cooked.\n\n==Etymology==\nFirst used around 1580, the name \"durian\" is derived from the [[Old Malay language]] word ''d\u00fbr\u00ee'' (meaning 'thorn'),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.etymonline.com/search?q=durian|title=Durian|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary, Douglas Harper|date=2018|accessdate=18 August 2018}}</ref> a reference to the numerous prickly thorns\nof the rind, together with the noun-building suffix ''-an''.<ref>{{cite dictionary| title = Durian| dictionary = Dictionary.com|url=https://www.dictionary.com/browse/durian?r=75?r=75 |date=2018|accessdate=18 August 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |quote=Via ''durion'', the Indonesia name for the plant. |title=Oxford English Dictionary |year=1897 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|title-link=Oxford English Dictionary }}</ref> The species name 'zibethinus' derives from the name of the [[civet]] (''Viverra zibetha''), known for its odour.<ref name=\"Husin\">{{cite journal | last=Husin | first=NA | last2=Rahman | first2=S | last3=Karunakaran | first3=R | last4=Bhore | first4=SJ | title=A review on the nutritional, medicinal, molecular and genome attributes of durian (''Durio zibethinus'' L.), the king of fruits in Malaysia | journal=Bioinformation | volume=14 | issue=6 | year=2018 | issn=0973-2063 | pmid=30237671 | pmc=6137565 | doi=10.6026/97320630014265 | pages=265\u2013270}}</ref>\n\n==Taxonomy==\n{{For|a complete list of known species of Durio|List of Durio species}}\n[[File:Durian flower.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Durian flowers are usually closed during the daytime]]\n\n''Durio sensu lato'' has 30 recognised species.<ref name=\"Brown\" /> ''Durio sensu stricto'' comprises 24 of these species.

His theory was that [[Zoochorous|endozoochory]] (the enticement of animals to transport seeds in their stomach) arose before any other method of [[Biological dispersal|seed dispersal]], and that primitive ancestors of ''Durio'' species were the earliest practitioners of that dispersal method, in particular red durian (''D. dulcis'') exemplifying the primitive fruit of flowering plants. However, in more recent circumscriptions of Durioneae, the tribe into which ''Durio'' and its sister taxa fall, fleshy arils and spiny fruits are derived within the clade. Some genera possess these characters, but others do not. The most recent molecular evidence (on which the most recent, well-supported circumscription of Durioneae is based) therefore refutes Corner's Durian Theory.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|title = Phylogenetic relationships of the durians (Bombacaceae-Durioneae or /Malvaceae/Helicteroideae/Durioneae) based on chloroplast and nuclear ribosomal DNA sequences|journal = Plant Systematics and Evolution|date = 2000-03-01|issn = 0378-2697|pages = 55\u201382|volume = 224|issue = 1\u20132|doi = 10.1007/BF00985266|first = R.|last = Nyffeler|first2 = D.

It consists of four short stories built into a [[frame narrative]] about a man who takes refuge from a rainstorm in the residence of a [[mortician]], with the four stories relating the fates of four corpses in the mortician's care.\n\n==Plot==\nAn adulterous man named Talmudge finds himself lost in a rainstorm on his way back to his hotel. He is invited indoors from the rain by a mortician, who tells Talmudge that he acquires and [[embalm]]s the bodies of people who experienced interesting and unique deaths. The mortician shows Talmudge several caskets, and details the fates of each of their occupants.\n\nThe first casket contains the body of Miss Sibiler, a school teacher who had a disdain for children. She is shown seemingly alone at home in her kitchen, where she turns on a radio and hears a mysterious noise coming from elsewhere. She investigates the sound to no avail, and upon returning to the kitchen, notices that the radio has been turned off. She goes upstairs to shower, and sees a silhouette through the shower curtain. Panicked, she closes and locks the doors and windows in her house. She is then confronted by three masked children, and initially believes that they have been playing a [[prank]] on her. However, more children enter her home, and remove their masks to reveal sharp teeth. They surround Miss Sibiler and maul her to death.\n\nThe second coffin holds the body of Growski, a man who had an affinity for cameras and photography. He is shown filming himself in his home, having invited a woman named Julie over for dinner. He convinces Julie, who is unaware that a camera is recording them, to remove her stockings so that he may perform a [[magic trick]] with them. He instead uses them to fatally choke her. He is then seen with a woman named Carol, who notices that the camera is running. He subdues her with a [[chokehold]] before strangling her with a cable. Finally, he is seen with Mrs. Lumquist, whom he stabs when she attempts to call a taxi to take her home. The mortician says that Growski was executed for the murders a year later, and that the state did not allow photographs to be taken at his execution.\n\nThe third story concerns Detective Malcolm Toliver, said to be the best criminal investigator in the United States, and Inspector McDowal, the greatest in England. The two egotistical sleuths are competing for the title of the world's leading [[criminologist]]. While having dinner together, Toliver receives a unsigned note telling him that someone he knows will die in three days, and that he is the only person who can prevent it. McDowal asks to follow Toliver along on this new case so that he may observe his methods, and Toliver agrees. Eventually, Toliver invites McDowal to his home to reveal his conclusion\u2014that he, himself, is the intended victim, and that McDowal is the killer. McDowal shoots him, but Toliver, wearing a [[bulletproof vest]], remarks that he solved the case two days prior, and activates a blade that impales McDowal. Toliver then opens McDowal's briefcase, which contains a timed explosive. The mortician possesses McDowal's body, and discloses that Toliver's body was too fragmented to be buried.\n\nThe fourth story follows an insensitive office worker named Cantwell. After dismissing the plight of a homeless man, Cantwell enters an empty store, and is unable to open the doors that lead back outside. He explores the place and is almost crushed in an elevator shaft. He becomes trapped in the building, and is subjected to mental and physical anguish, with only alcohol to drink. Eventually, an exit appears, and Cantwell wanders back into the outside world. Dirty and bloodied, Cantwell approaches a businessman who disregards him before entering the building himself. The mortician explains that Cantwell ultimately died in a [[Street gutter|gutter]] from a rotten liver. \n\nTalmudge notices a fifth casket, which is empty. The mortician says that it belongs to someone who practiced [[infidelity]]. He then reveals that he knows Talmudge's name, and refers to him as a client of his. Frightened, Talmudge runs away, and is cornered in an alley and shot by the husband of a woman whom Talmudge was intimate with. Talmudge is loaded into an ambulance, and the mortician is shown sitting in the passenger's seat.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast list |\n* [[John Ericson]] as Talmudge\n* [[Ivor Francis]] as The Mortician\n* Judith Novgrod as Miss Sibiler\n* [[Burr DeBenning]] as Growski\n* [[Charles Aidman]] as Detective Malcolm Toliver\n* [[Bernard Fox (actor)|Bernard Fox]] as Inspector McDowal\n* Richard Gates as Cantwell\n* [[Elizabeth MacRae]] as Mrs. Lumquist\n* [[Linda Gibboney]] as Julie\n* Leslie Paxton as Marie\n* John King as Marie's Husband\n* Stefanie Auerbach as Carol\n* Bo Byers as Growski Detective #1\n* David O'Malley as Growski Detective #2\n* Robert Telford as Maitre'd\n* Michael Colley as Stan\n* Gary Willis as Magazine Store Owner\n* Robert J.

During last free democratic elections before the [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia]], the May 1938 communal elections, the party gained 88% of ethnic-German votes, taking over control of most municipal authorities in the Czech borderland.

Altogether 70 members of Gendarmerie and 30 State Police officers were trying to restore order, using only batons as they were under orders preventing use of firearms apart from necessary self defense.\n\nOn 13 September the mob in the streets numbered some 2.000 people, but now armed with knives, sticks and stones and also some firearms. The mob tried to push police cordon  out of the main square. Several shots were fired in both directions, leading to death of one German while ''Police Officers Lodr, And\u011bl and \u010cmel\u00e1k'' suffered injuries in the scuffle. Thereafter mob dispersed. Later during the day reinforcements of 60 policemen and an army unit that included also tanks and infantry fighting vehicles arrived, fully restoring order in the town.\n\nOn 14 September, police moved to conduct a search warrant of local hotel on suspicion that it was being used to store illegal firearms for Ordners. As police tried to breach the entrance, several perpetrators opened gunfire from hotel windows from rifles, pistols and at least one machinegun. '''Police Officer Jan Klenner''' was mortally wounded. Railway worker '''Emmanuel Bl\u00e1ha''' that happened to be nearby attempted first to help Klenner, then to return fire with the policeman's rifle, but was also shot dead. Another civilian '''V\u00e1clav Tej\u010dek''' tried to help the two but was also shot dead. Immense gunfire from hotel windows hit and killed also three random German civilians in the street. After dusk police used many hand grenades and then entered the building, that was already mostly empty. The only person caught was later released as there was no evidence tying him to the gunfire; according to his testimony a group of around 10 men armed mostly with pistols and with two machineguns was responsible for the shootout. <ref>Bru\u017ee\u0148\u00e1k, Ciglbauer, Koc, Kol\u00e1\u0159, Rejthar, Van\u011b\u010dek, Zatloukalov\u00e1, pp. 49-57</ref>\n|-\n|13 September 1938\n|'''[[Habartov]]'''\n|align=center|Local SdP carries out lawful demonstration in the streets.

Armed ordners first seize post office with telephone switchboard and take its workers as well as one municipal policemen captive. German mob, many of them armed, surround police station and demand surrender of policemen. Mob forces its way into the building where they corner two and two armed policemen in different rooms. Policemen, under orders not to use firearms, refuse to surrender. Germans try to wrestle firearms from policemen's hands. Failing to do that Germans start shooting, killing '''Sergeant Major Jan Koukol'''. Rest of the policemen return fire, killing two attackers and wounding another. Most Germans flee from the station. The three surviving policemen, one of them with hand wounded by gunshot and the two others wounded in face with glass shards, fortify the station while Germans take positions in the houses around the station (which is situated on a ground floor of building that is used also as German-language primary school) start continuous barrage of fire into the station's windows.\n\nTwo Orderns are killed and two others seriously wounded during first two hours of shootout, leading Germans to call for more reinforcements against the three policemen whose telephone line was cut. Germans then try to flood the station with use of firefighting vehicle, but are again driven away by police gunfire. Germans then take one of the policemen's wife, put a noose on her neck and send her half-naked in front of the station while holding the other end of the noose, demanding immediate surrender under threat of killing her. Policemen surrender.\n\nConstable ''Mat\u011bj P\u0159\u00edbek'' is beaten and locked in nearby house. ''Constable Jan Paulus'' is beaten senseless and then two times again after regaining consciousness. '''Constable Anton\u00edn K\u0159epela''', after seeing mob attack on Paulus, tries to run away and is shot and wounded. Lying on the ground, Germans beat him to death with clubs and pickaxes.\n\nHaving lost all contact, county police HQ sends a bus with 15 policemen to Habartov at 1 pm. Immediately after stopping at town square in front of the police station, policemen are subjected to a barrage of fire from Germans hidden in windows in houses overlooking the square. '''Corporal Stanislav Roubal''' is shot in the head and killed, ''Constable Vav\u0159inec Hyka'' is shot in the head and wounded. Policemen try to get into the station, which is however also occupied by Ordners who open fire as they try to get in. Policemen then scramble towards a house nearby while '''Sergeant Vladim\u00edr \u010cern\u00fd''' is shot in the chest and killed. Eleven policemen manage to get into a house opposite to the station and from which they start firing at the Ordners. At 2 pm, further police reinforcements arrive and Ordners mostly run away towards the border with Germany. Seven perpetrators are caught and arrested, however, due to developments in the following weeks, they escape justice. Court proceedings continue only after WW2, leading to 10 perpetrators receiving the death penalty, six of which are carried out.<ref name=\"muzi\">{{Citation\n| last1  = Vladim\u00edr Bru\u017ee\u0148\u00e1k, Jan Ciglbauer, Karel Koc, Ond\u0159ej Kol\u00e1\u0159, Milan Rejthar, Ji\u0159\u00ed Van\u011b\u010dek, Alena Zatloukalov\u00e1 \n| lastauthoramp = \n| title     = Mu\u017ei na hranici: Boje se sudeton\u011bmeck\u00fdmi Henleinovci v roce 1938\n| publisher = Nakladatelstv\u00ed epocha, Pra\u017esk\u00e1 vydavatelsk\u00e1 spole\u010dnost\n| place     = Prague\n| volume  = \n| edition = 1st\n| year    = 2019\n| page  = 11\n}}</ref>\n|-\n|13 September 1938\n|'''[[St\u0159\u00edbrn\u00e1]]'''\n|align=center|SdP attempt to take over police station thwarted.\n\n[[File:Stribrna_SO_CZ.png|250px|center]]\n|align=center|German mob assembles in front of police station, local SdP leaders demand the immediate surrender of all security forces.

Around midday, a large crowd from Germany advances towards Czechoslovak customs house, part of which is used for official purposes and part includes flats where customs officers' families live. Meanwhile, Ordners cut the telephone line leading to the customs house. Seven customs officers inside are under strict orders preventing them from shooting in the direction of German border and decide to simply lock doors and wait. SdP members break through the doors and mob floods the customs house. Customs officers decide to surrender their firearms while Germans loot offices as well as private flats. At about 1 pm the crown moves on in the direction of towncenter and police station, which is about 1&nbsp;km away from the customs house.<br /><br />\nAfter a brief standoff, two buses carrying reinforcements with 14 policemen and several soldiers arrive. While the situation around the police station deescalates, one bus is sent with three policemen to the customs house. While trying to negotiate release of customs officials and their family members, policemen are ambushed by Germans shooting from behind concrete barrier on the border. '''Constable Josef Falber''' is shot in the stomach and bleeds to death. ''Constable Bohuslav Kazda'' is shot in the head close to the ear and loses consciousness. ''Superintendent Nov\u00fd'' returns fire and suffers shot wound into hand and leg. While on the ground, mob attacks him. German customs officers cross border and prevent Nov\u00fd from being beaten to death.\n\nAfter hearing gunfire, three policemen and four customs officers (whose families are held hostage) drive a second bus towards the customs house. Being ambushed by heavy gunfire, they dismount about 100 meters from the target. ''Seargant Major Hr\u00e1dek'', police station chief who leads the group, is shot in the leg. Severally outnumbered and with orders preventing them to return fire in the direction of Germany proper, they load wounded Nov\u00fd and Kazda and drive back to the police station.\n\nOrdners send negotiators to the police station. Germans agree to free the customs officers and their wives and children. Family members drive further inland to Czechoslovakia and freed customs officers reinforce police station. Ordners cut the telephone line to the station and start building barricades around the police station. Police chief burns all secret files, shortly thereafter mob breaks through the doors and all 45 members of Czechoslovak security forces surrender with no shots being fired.\n\nAltogether 45 captive members of Czechoslovak security forces are taken to Germany proper where they are imprisoned until mid-October when they are returned to Czechoslovak authorities.<ref>Bru\u017ee\u0148\u00e1k, Ciglbauer, Koc, Kol\u00e1\u0159, Rejthar, Van\u011b\u010dek, Zatloukalov\u00e1, p. 17</ref>\n\nAfter successfully dealing with situation in St\u0159\u00edbrn\u00e1 (see elsewhere in this table), Sergeant Major Franti\u0161ek Nov\u00e1k is ordered to send a patrol to Bublava with which the regional HQ lost telephone contact. Nov\u00e1k himself leads SDG group of two policemen, eight customs officers and two armed civilians. Unknown to them, all members of security forces in Bublava were already captured and kidnapped over the border to Germany.\n\nSDG group reaches Bublava after dusk. While advancing towards the police station, the group walks into a well-prepared ambush. An intense firefight erupts. ''Superintendent Emil Martin\u016f'' is wounded by the explosion of a hand grenade. '''Constable Vojt\u011bch Br\u010d\u00e1k''' is shot in stomach and dies.

Due to the initial Czechoslovak orders forbidding use of firearms apart from self-defense, Freikorps also captured Czechoslovak weapons, mostly vz.24 rifles and vz.26 machine guns.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nMeanwhile, the Green Cadres, as well as other ordners that did not join Freikorps, were armed with a variety of hunting rifles and shotguns, pistols, as well as many sub-machine guns that had been previously supplied by Germany to the Ordnersgruppe/Freiwilliger Schutzdienst.

At the time, protection of borders was mostly vested into the authority of the Customs Administration (also called Financial Police), which was controlling the border crossings and collecting customs duties, while Gendarme officers were taking care of general law enforcement mainly within towns. This was deemed insufficient as the Customs Administration could merely enforce the custom duties and general order at border crossings, but not security along the whole border.<ref name=\"Hru\u0161ka, p. 17\"/>  In 1936, the State Defense Guard was established. Normally, SDG would function only in a very limited way necessary to ensure full readiness of its structure (under authority of Ministry of Interior), with its ranks being filled up with personnel in case of emergency (under military command). Its main task was protecting the Czechoslovak border and it was supposed to be able to immediately close and defend the border for the time that would be necessary for the army to reach the attacked areas in full combat readiness. Initially, the State Defense Guard was composed of selected members of Customs Administration, Gendarme and State Police, but later its ranks were filled also with reliable civilians. In case of any unrest, its squads were further boosted by army soldiers. State Defense Guard included also ethnic-Germans that were deemed loyal to Czechoslovak state (mostly Social Democrats and communists).

Among them was a number of Freikorps members, who used the commotion and got right to the two Gendarme officers on duty and disarmed them. The mob released the two officers and continued towards the town center. After briefing the two disarmed Gendarme officers, SDG squad leader Josef Nov\u00e1k contacted the town's mayor, an ethnic-German G\u00f6bel, who promised that he will negotiate return of the Gendarme's firearms. Officers Nov\u00e1k and Posp\u00ed\u0161il left SDG station and went towards the town center, now in hands of Freikorps. There, they were both immediately attacked and lynched to death. Before dying, Posp\u00ed\u0161il tossed away a hand grenade, wounding several assailants. Later that day Freikorps members lynched to death also an ethnic-German communist Fitz. Groups of heavily armed Freikorps started taking over the whole town. Remaining SDG members and Gendarme officers decided to lay covering fire and evacuate several civilians as well as themselves towards train station. There they fortified several wagons and drove away. Meanwhile, however, Freikorps blocked the railway line leading to the next train station in [[Velk\u00e1 Kra\u0161]] and took positions in a school building overlooking the line. After the train stopped before the blockage just in front of the school, Freikorps opened fire from rifles and started tossing hand grenades. The train occupants ran away from the building and train towards fields, leaving behind one dead civilian and two wounded SDG members and several wounded civilians, who were captured by Freikorps and delivered to Germany. There they were first treated and later released. The rest managed to get away and under constant covering fire reached the train station in Velk\u00e1 Kra\u0161. Here, Freikorps leader Latzel first persisted that the SDG personnel must surrender. The SDG squad, now consisting of 13 seriously wounded and a few lightly wounded members, refused and stated the intent to either get further inland or die trying.

On 24 April, the SdP issued a series of demands upon the government of Czechoslovakia, that were known as the Carlsbad Program. {{sfn|Noakes|Pridham|2010|loc= Vol. 3|pp=100\u2013101}} Among the demands, Henlein demanded autonomy for Germans living in Czechoslovakia.<ref name=\"Eleanor L.

During last free democratic elections before the [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia]], the May 1938 communal elections, the party gained 88% of ethnic-German votes, taking over control of most municipal authorities in the Czech borderland. The country's mass membership made it one of the largest fascist parties in Europe at the time.<ref name=\"Hru\u0161ka11\">{{Citation\n| last1  = Hru\u0161ka\n| first1 = Emil\n| lastauthoramp = \n| title     = Boj o pohrani\u010d\u00ed: Sudeton\u011bmeck\u00fd Freikorps v roce 1938\n| publisher = Nakladatelstv\u00ed epocha, Pra\u017esk\u00e1 vydavatelsk\u00e1 spole\u010dnost\n| place     = Prague\n| volume  = \n| edition = 1st\n| year    = 2013\n| page  = 11\n}}</ref>\n\nThe first major crisis took place in May 1938 after a partial Czechoslovak army [[mobilization]]. Activities of pro-Nazi ethnic Germans in the area led to a large flight of ethnic-Czech civilians and especially Jews. Hitler's increasing threats of attacking Czechoslovakia led to full mobilization on 22 September 1938. Many ethnic-Germans refused to follow the Czechoslovak army mobilization order and either ran across the border to Germany and joined Freikorps, continuing cross border raids from there, or established ''Gr\u00fcn Freikorps'' units which were operating from Czechoslovak forests, receiving arms and equipment from Germany, and continuing raids against Czechoslovak authorities, Jews and Czechs, up until the [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|German occupation of the Czechoslovak border areas]] following the [[Munich agreement]].\n\n==Ordnersgruppe, Freiwilliger Schutzdienst==\n{{infobox military unit\n|unit_name  = Freiwilliger Schutzdienst\n|native_name = ''Ordnersgruppe''\n|native_name_lang = de\n|image      = [[File:KarlHermannFrank.jpg|200px]]\n|caption    = [[Karl Hermann Frank]], FS's vice-F\u00fchrer who was receiving orders directly from Hitler\n|dates      = 17 May 1938 to 16 September 1938\n|country    = {{flagdeco|Czechoslovakia}} [[Czechoslovakia]]\n|allegiance = {{flagdeco|Nazi Germany}} [[Nazi Germany|Germany]]\n|branch     = \n|type       = Terrorist organization\n|role       = Break-up of Czechoslovakia\n|size       = \n|command_structure =\n|garrison          =\n|garrison_label    =\n|nickname =\n|patron   =\n|motto    =\n|colors   =\n|colors_label =\n|march=\n|mascot=\n|equipment=\n|equipment_label=\n|battles=\n|anniversaries=\n|decorations=\n|battle_honours=\n|disbanded=\n|flying_hours=\n|website=\n<!-- Commanders -->\n|commander1= [[File:Flag of the Sudets (without CoA).Svg|23px]] Konrad Henlein\n|commander1_label= F\u00fchrer\n|commander2= [[File:Flag of the Sudets (without CoA).Svg|23px]] Karl Hermann Frank\n|commander2_label= Vice-F\u00fchrer\n|commander3= [[File:Flag of the Sudets (without CoA).Svg|23px]] Fritz K\u00f6llner\n|commander3_label= Secretary\n|commander4= [[File:Flag of the Sudets (without CoA).Svg|23px]] Willi Brandner\n|commander4_label= Chief of staff\n|notable_commanders=\n<!-- Insignia -->\n|identification_symbol=\n|identification_symbol_label=\n|identification_symbol_2=\n|identification_symbol_2_label=\n|identification_symbol_3=\n|identification_symbol_3_label=\n|identification_symbol_4=\n|identification_symbol_4_label=\n<!-- Aircraft -->\n|aircraft_attack=\n|aircraft_bomber=\n|aircraft_electronic=\n|aircraft_fighter=\n|aircraft_helicopter=\n|aircraft_helicopter_attack=\n|aircraft_helicopter_cargo=\n|aircraft_helicopter_multirole=\n|aircraft_helicopter_observation=\n|aircraft_helicopter_transport=\n|aircraft_helicopter_utility=\n|aircraft_interceptor=\n|aircraft_patrol=\n|aircraft_recon=\n|aircraft_trainer=\n|aircraft_transport=\n}}\n\n===Forming of the organization===\nImmediately after establishing the ''[[Sudeten German Party|Sudetendeutsche Heimatfront]]'' (later Sudeten German Party, '''SdP''') in 1933, the party started forming its informal '''Ordnungsdienst''' (''Order Service'', its members called in German '''''Ordners''''') which was officially supposed to preserve order during meetings and assemblies of the party and protect it against its political adversaries.

By 17 May 1938, the date of the organization's official registration, Schutzdienst had over 15.000 members.<ref name=\"Hru\u0161ka, p. 13\"/>\n\nSchutzdienst started a wide recruitment program in June 1938. Its members were divided into three categories:<ref name=\"Hru\u0161ka, p. 13\"/>\n* '''Category A''': The most trusted and physically capable members that were supposed to carry out the duty of guardians of \"inner purity\" of the SdP. The Category A was composed of the so-called \"surveillance departments\" and was directly subordinate to the SdP. Apart from functions within the organization, its members were also collecting information on political opponents and conducting military espionage.<ref name=\"Hru\u0161ka, p. 13\"/>\n* '''Category B''': Wider selection of members. Its members were trained for propaganda activities and for conducting terrorist and sabotage assaults.<ref name=\"Hru\u0161ka, p. 13\"/>\n* '''Category C''': Mostly older members of FS, mainly former soldiers with World War I front line experience.

FS squads were kept in a state of high alert, ready to conduct any orders that may come from \"higher up\". On 10 September 1938, all FS district headquarters received orders to start large scale demonstrations, which escalated to a number of wounded members of Czechoslovak law enforcement as well as FS members in numerous cities already the next day.<ref>''Hru\u0161ka, p. 14''</ref> FS Vice-F\u00fchrer Karl Hermann Frank was in direct contact with Hitler, receiving instructions for the following days.<ref name=\"Hru\u0161ka, p. 15\">''Hru\u0161ka, p. 15''</ref>\n\nImmediately after the highly anticipated Hitler's final speech on 12 September 1938, in which Hitler claimed to take care of German interests \"under any circumstances\" and to \"prevent creation of second Palestine in the heart of Europe where the poor Arabs are defenseless and abandoned, while Germans in Czechoslovakia are not defenseless, nor abandoned\", FS initiated widespread violence in the whole borderland.<ref name=\"Hru\u0161ka, p. 15\"/> In [[Cheb]] alone, K.H.Frank's hometown, ethnic-German mob plundered 38 Czech and Jewish shops.<ref name=\"Hru\u0161ka, p. 15\"/> Other main targets included buildings of the German Social Democratic Party and Czechoslovak authorities, including schools.<ref name=\"Hru\u0161ka, p. 15\"/> FS conducted over 70 armed assaults against Czechoslovak authorities and assaulted also selected Czechs and ethnic-German anti-fascists.<ref name=\"Hru\u0161ka, p. 15\"/> Czechoslovak law enforcement was meanwhile ordered not to intervene in order not to further fuel up Hitler's propaganda.<ref name=\"Hru\u0161ka, p. 15\"/>\n\nAs it became clear that SdP was attempting to push the Czechoslovak authorities out of the towns in borderland and replace them with own governance, and with rising death toll that included, inter alia, murder of four Gendarme officers by FS in [[Habartov]], the Czechoslovak government responded by declaring martial law in 13 worst struck districts and by dispatching military.<ref name=\"Hru\u0161ka, p. 17\">''Hru\u0161ka, p. 17''</ref> Major assaults on Czechoslovak law enforcement as well as military continued throughout 14 September 1938, with the last one taking place on 15 September in [[Bublava]].<ref name=\"Hru\u0161ka, p. 17\"/> Altogether, the violence led to 13 dead and numerous injuries on 12\u201313 September and culminated with 23 dead (13 Czechoslovak authorities personnel, 10 ethnic Germans) and 75 seriously wounded (of those 14 ethnic Germans) on 14 September, however the attempted putsch was thwarted.<ref name=\"Hru\u0161ka, p. 17\"/>\n\nOn 14 September 1938, SdP's leadership ran across border to [[Selb]], Germany, where K.H. Frank unsuccessfully demanded immediate military intervention from Hitler.<ref name=\"Hru\u0161ka, p. 30\">''Hru\u0161ka, p. 30''</ref> The leadership's flight had chilling effect on the FS members, especially those that had taken part in the violence and now feared criminal prosecution. On 15 September 1938, German radio broadcast Henlein's speech, who was purportedly speaking live from [[A\u0161]] in Czechoslovakia.<ref name=\"Hru\u0161ka, p. 30\"/> By this time, the SdP's flight to Germany had become public knowledge and according to the then German ambassador in Prague, instead of stimulating SdP's members to further actions, it led to a serious rift in its ranks.<ref name=\"Hru\u0161ka, p. 30\"/>\n\nOn 16 September 1938, Czechoslovak authorities banned and dissolved SdP as well as FS. Many of its functionaries as well as members that were wanted for arrest in connection with the preceding violence fled to Germany, while a number of town mayors elected for SdP compelled FS members to keep calm and expressed their support to the commanders of Gendarme stations situated in their towns.<ref name=\"Hru\u0161ka, p. 30\"/>\n\n<gallery heights=\"150px\" mode=\"packed\" caption=\"Sudeten German Party Putsch\">\nFile:1._m\u00e1j_1938_v_Liberci_2.gif|SdP's assembly on 1 May 1938 in [[Liberec]]\nFile:K.H._Frank_na_sjezdu_Sudeton\u011bmeck\u00e9_strany_24.4.1938.jpg|K.H.Frank speaking during 1938 SdP congress\nFile:Poh\u0159eb padl\u00fdch \u010desk\u00fdch ob\u011bt\u00ed.jpg|Funeral of Czech victims in Sokolov, including 4 Gendarme officers murdered in Habartov\nFile:Sudeton\u011bmeck\u00fd pu\u010d, A\u0161 - z\u00e1\u0159\u00ed 1938.jpg|Main street in A\u0161, where SdP's leadership met on 13 September 1938 before fleeing to Germany\nFile:\u010cs._voj\u00e1ci_v_Kr\u00e1sn\u00e9_L\u00edp\u011b.gif|Czechoslovak soldiers patrolling in [[\u010cesk\u00e1 L\u00edpa]]\n</gallery>\n'''Notable engagements'''\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:90%;\"\n|-\n!Date\n!Place\n!Summary\n!Details\n|-\n|11 - 14 September 1938\n|'''[[Cheb]]'''\n|align=center|Major unrests by up to 4.000 members of SdP\n\n[[File:Cheb_CH_CZ.png|250px|center]]\n|align=center|Cheb, a district town and SdP stronghold, faces major unrests already on 11 September 1938 as SdP tries to disrupt assembly of Czechoslovak automobile association in the town's theater, leading to clashes with police that resulted in 17 lightly wounded policemen and ''Police Officer V\u00e1clav Br\u016f\u017eek'' suffering a severe injury.\n\nOn 12 September 1938, immediately after the end of Hitler's Nuremberg speech, mob of up to 4.000 SdP members and supporters rushed into streets, sacking 38 Jewish and Czech shops and lynching Jews and Czechs. Altogether 70 members of Gendarmerie and 30 State Police officers were trying to restore order, using only batons as they were under orders preventing use of firearms apart from necessary self defense.\n\nOn 13 September the mob in the streets numbered some 2.000 people, but now armed with knives, sticks and stones and also some firearms. The mob tried to push police cordon  out of the main square. Several shots were fired in both directions, leading to death of one German while ''Police Officers Lodr, And\u011bl and \u010cmel\u00e1k'' suffered injuries in the scuffle. Thereafter mob dispersed. Later during the day reinforcements of 60 policemen and an army unit that included also tanks and infantry fighting vehicles arrived, fully restoring order in the town.\n\nOn 14 September, police moved to conduct a search warrant of local hotel on suspicion that it was being used to store illegal firearms for Ordners. As police tried to breach the entrance, several perpetrators opened gunfire from hotel windows from rifles, pistols and at least one machinegun. '''Police Officer Jan Klenner''' was mortally wounded. Railway worker '''Emmanuel Bl\u00e1ha''' that happened to be nearby attempted first to help Klenner, then to return fire with the policeman's rifle, but was also shot dead. Another civilian '''V\u00e1clav Tej\u010dek''' tried to help the two but was also shot dead. Immense gunfire from hotel windows hit and killed also three random German civilians in the street.

Armed ordners first seize post office with telephone switchboard and take its workers as well as one municipal policemen captive. German mob, many of them armed, surround police station and demand surrender of policemen. Mob forces its way into the building where they corner two and two armed policemen in different rooms. Policemen, under orders not to use firearms, refuse to surrender. Germans try to wrestle firearms from policemen's hands. Failing to do that Germans start shooting, killing '''Sergeant Major Jan Koukol'''. Rest of the policemen return fire, killing two attackers and wounding another. Most Germans flee from the station. The three surviving policemen, one of them with hand wounded by gunshot and the two others wounded in face with glass shards, fortify the station while Germans take positions in the houses around the station (which is situated on a ground floor of building that is used also as German-language primary school) start continuous barrage of fire into the station's windows.\n\nTwo Orderns are killed and two others seriously wounded during first two hours of shootout, leading Germans to call for more reinforcements against the three policemen whose telephone line was cut. Germans then try to flood the station with use of firefighting vehicle, but are again driven away by police gunfire. Germans then take one of the policemen's wife, put a noose on her neck and send her half-naked in front of the station while holding the other end of the noose, demanding immediate surrender under threat of killing her. Policemen surrender.\n\nConstable ''Mat\u011bj P\u0159\u00edbek'' is beaten and locked in nearby house. ''Constable Jan Paulus'' is beaten senseless and then two times again after regaining consciousness. '''Constable Anton\u00edn K\u0159epela''', after seeing mob attack on Paulus, tries to run away and is shot and wounded. Lying on the ground, Germans beat him to death with clubs and pickaxes.\n\nHaving lost all contact, county police HQ sends a bus with 15 policemen to Habartov at 1 pm. Immediately after stopping at town square in front of the police station, policemen are subjected to a barrage of fire from Germans hidden in windows in houses overlooking the square. '''Corporal Stanislav Roubal''' is shot in the head and killed, ''Constable Vav\u0159inec Hyka'' is shot in the head and wounded. Policemen try to get into the station, which is however also occupied by Ordners who open fire as they try to get in. Policemen then scramble towards a house nearby while '''Sergeant Vladim\u00edr \u010cern\u00fd''' is shot in the chest and killed. Eleven policemen manage to get into a house opposite to the station and from which they start firing at the Ordners. At 2 pm, further police reinforcements arrive and Ordners mostly run away towards the border with Germany.

While the situation around the police station deescalates, one bus is sent with three policemen to the customs house. While trying to negotiate release of customs officials and their family members, policemen are ambushed by Germans shooting from behind concrete barrier on the border. '''Constable Josef Falber''' is shot in the stomach and bleeds to death. ''Constable Bohuslav Kazda'' is shot in the head close to the ear and loses consciousness. ''Superintendent Nov\u00fd'' returns fire and suffers shot wound into hand and leg. While on the ground, mob attacks him. German customs officers cross border and prevent Nov\u00fd from being beaten to death.\n\nAfter hearing gunfire, three policemen and four customs officers (whose families are held hostage) drive a second bus towards the customs house. Being ambushed by heavy gunfire, they dismount about 100 meters from the target. ''Seargant Major Hr\u00e1dek'', police station chief who leads the group, is shot in the leg. Severally outnumbered and with orders preventing them to return fire in the direction of Germany proper, they load wounded Nov\u00fd and Kazda and drive back to the police station.\n\nOrdners send negotiators to the police station. Germans agree to free the customs officers and their wives and children. Family members drive further inland to Czechoslovakia and freed customs officers reinforce police station. Ordners cut the telephone line to the station and start building barricades around the police station. Police chief burns all secret files, shortly thereafter mob breaks through the doors and all 45 members of Czechoslovak security forces surrender with no shots being fired.\n\nAltogether 45 captive members of Czechoslovak security forces are taken to Germany proper where they are imprisoned until mid-October when they are returned to Czechoslovak authorities.<ref>Bru\u017ee\u0148\u00e1k, Ciglbauer, Koc, Kol\u00e1\u0159, Rejthar, Van\u011b\u010dek, Zatloukalov\u00e1, p. 17</ref>\n\nAfter successfully dealing with situation in St\u0159\u00edbrn\u00e1 (see elsewhere in this table), Sergeant Major Franti\u0161ek Nov\u00e1k is ordered to send a patrol to Bublava with which the regional HQ lost telephone contact. Nov\u00e1k himself leads SDG group of two policemen, eight customs officers and two armed civilians. Unknown to them, all members of security forces in Bublava were already captured and kidnapped over the border to Germany.\n\nSDG group reaches Bublava after dusk. While advancing towards the police station, the group walks into a well-prepared ambush. An intense firefight erupts. ''Superintendent Emil Martin\u016f'' is wounded by the explosion of a hand grenade. '''Constable Vojt\u011bch Br\u010d\u00e1k''' is shot in stomach and dies. '''Sergeant Major Franti\u0161ek Nov\u00e1k''' suffers multiple shot wounds and dies. ''Armed civilian Franti\u0161ek Moucha'' is wounded on head.

It was headed by [[Richard Lammel]]. The intelligence was gathering information for Freikorps as well as for [[Abwehr]], [[Sicherheitsdienst]] (SD) and [[Gestapo]].\n\n====Green Cadres====\nMany ethnic-Germans who deserted after receiving mobilization order didn't go across the border to Germany, but rather established own guerrilla units. Operating from forests in Czechoslovakia, they received name the '''Green Cadres''', sometimes being referred to as '''Green Freikorps''', although they were not officially incorporated as part of German Freikorps.\n\n====Armaments====\nIn order to conceal the level of cooperation between Wehrmacht and Freikorps, the original orders stated that Freikorps should be armed only with weapons from warehouses of the former Austrian army.<ref name=\"Hru\u0161ka, p. 35\"/> This however led to delays in arming of Freikorps and became outright impossible as regards ammunition and explosives, which were being delivered from Wehrmacht's own supplies.<ref name=\"Hru\u0161ka, p. 43\"/> Most common weapons were Mannlicher 1895 8\u00d756 Msch., K98k 8\u00d756 JS, pistols P08 9mm Parabellum, Bergmann machine guns and sub-machine guns and German hand grenades. Due to the initial Czechoslovak orders forbidding use of firearms apart from self-defense, Freikorps also captured Czechoslovak weapons, mostly vz.24 rifles and vz.26 machine guns.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nMeanwhile, the Green Cadres, as well as other ordners that did not join Freikorps, were armed with a variety of hunting rifles and shotguns, pistols, as well as many sub-machine guns that had been previously supplied by Germany to the Ordnersgruppe/Freiwilliger Schutzdienst. Scoped hunting rifles in hands of skilled ordners proved especially deadly.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n<!---\n<gallery heights=\"150px\" mode=\"packed\" caption=\"Freikorps armaments\">\nFile:Mannlicher_M1895_from_the_Swedish_Army_Museum.jpg|[[Mannlicher M1895]] rifle\nFile:Kar_98K_-_AM.021488.jpg|[[Karabiner 98k]] rifle \nFile:Bergmann_MP18.1.JPG|[[MP 18|Bergmann MP 18]] sub-machine gun\nFile:Parabellum_1586.png|[[P08]] pistol\nFile:MWP_Stielhandgranate.JPG|[[Model 24 grenade]]\nFile:Vz24.jpg|[[vz. 24]] rifle\nFile:ZB-26_in_Taipei.JPG|[[ZB vz. 26|vz. 26]] machine gun\n</gallery>--->\n\n===Czechoslovak security forces===\n{{main|State Defense Guard (Czechoslovakia)}}\nFollowing the [[Remilitarization of the Rhineland]], Czechoslovak authorities came to the conclusion that any future war would most probably take place by a sudden attack without formal declaration of war. At the time, protection of borders was mostly vested into the authority of the Customs Administration (also called Financial Police), which was controlling the border crossings and collecting customs duties, while Gendarme officers were taking care of general law enforcement mainly within towns. This was deemed insufficient as the Customs Administration could merely enforce the custom duties and general order at border crossings, but not security along the whole border.<ref name=\"Hru\u0161ka, p. 17\"/>  In 1936, the State Defense Guard was established. Normally, SDG would function only in a very limited way necessary to ensure full readiness of its structure (under authority of Ministry of Interior), with its ranks being filled up with personnel in case of emergency (under military command). Its main task was protecting the Czechoslovak border and it was supposed to be able to immediately close and defend the border for the time that would be necessary for the army to reach the attacked areas in full combat readiness. Initially, the State Defense Guard was composed of selected members of Customs Administration, Gendarme and State Police, but later its ranks were filled also with reliable civilians. In case of any unrest, its squads were further boosted by army soldiers. State Defense Guard included also ethnic-Germans that were deemed loyal to Czechoslovak state (mostly Social Democrats and communists). The State Defense Guard has thus become the main target of the Freikorps' activities.\n\nUp to 22 September 1938 the Czechoslovak security forces were under general orders not to use their firearms apart from self-defense.\n\n====Republikanische Wehr====\n'''Republikanische Wehr''' was Czechoslovak ethnic-German anti-fascists militia with several thousand members. Known also as '''Rote Wehr''' (''Red Defense''), its members also took part in the fights, supporting the Czechoslovak authorities. Several of its members were killed by the Nazi forces during the clashes, with thousands more being interned in concentration camps following the Munich Agreement and occupation of Czechoslovakia.\n\n==Undeclared German\u2013Czechoslovak War==\n{{Expand section|date=May 2018}}\n{{Infobox military conflict\n| conflict    = Undeclared German\u2013Czechoslovak war\n| partof      = [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia]]\n| image       = File:Pochod_Freikorpsu_v_Hazlov\u00e9_u_A\u0161e_1938.jpg\n| caption     = Marching Freikorps unit\n| date        = 17 September \u2013 early October 1938\n| place       = [[Sudetenland|Czechoslovak borderlands]]\n| coordinates = \n| map_type    = \n| map_relief  = \n| latitude    = \n| longitude   = \n| map_size    = \n| map_marksize = \n| map_caption = \n| map_label   = \n| territory   = \n| result      = Military: Czechoslovak Army deployment mostly restored order.<br>Political: [[Appeasement]] through the [[Munich Agreement]].<br>Strategical: [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|German occupation of Czechoslovak borderland]]\n| status      = \n| combatants_header = \n| combatant1  = {{flagdeco|Nazi Germany}} [[Nazi Germany|Germany]]\n* {{flagdeco|Nazi Germany}} Sudeten German Freikorps\n* [[File:Flag Schutzstaffel.svg|23px]] [[Schutzstaffel|SS]]\n* [[File:SA-Logo.svg|23px]] [[Sturmabteilung|SA]]\n* {{flagdeco|Nazi Germany}} [[Abwehr]]\n\n[[File:Flag of the Sudets (without CoA).Svg|23px]] [[Sudeten German Party]]\n* [[File:Flag of the Sudets (without CoA).Svg|23px]] Gr\u00fcne Cadres\n| combatant2  = {{flagcountry|Czechoslovakia}}\n* {{flagicon|Czechoslovakia}} [[Czechoslovak Army]]\n* {{flagicon|Czechoslovakia}} [[State Defense Guard (Czechoslovakia)|State Defense Guard]]\n* {{flagicon|Czechoslovakia}} Customs Administration, Gendarme, State Police\n* [[Republikanische Wehr]]\n| combatant3  = \n| commander1  = {{plainlist|\n* {{flagdeco|Nazi Germany}} Friedrich K\u00f6chling\n* [[File:Flag of the Sudets (without CoA).Svg|23px]] Konrad Henlein\n* [[File:Flag of the Sudets (without CoA).Svg|23px]] Karl Hermann Frank\n* [[File:Flag of the Sudets (without CoA).Svg|23px]] Fritz K\u00f6llner\n* [[File:Flag of the Sudets (without CoA).Svg|23px]] Willi Brandner}}\n| commander2  ={{plainlist|\n* {{flagicon|Czechoslovakia}} [[Jan Syrov\u00fd]]\n* {{flagicon|Czechoslovakia}} [[Ludv\u00edk Krej\u010d\u00ed]]}}\n| commander3  = \n| units1      = \n| units2      = \n| units3      = \n| strength1   = \n| strength2   = \n| strength3   = \n| casualties1 = '''Freikorps''':\n* '''Killed''': 52\n* '''Wounded''': 65\n* '''Missing in action''': 19\n'''Other''': Unknown\n| casualties2 = '''Armed forces''':\n* '''Killed''': 110\n* '''Wounded''': 50\n* '''Abducted''': 2029 (including railway employees, postal workers, judges, other functionaries and their family members)\n'''Civilians''': Unknown (both volunteers as well as innocent victims of Freikorps terror)\n| casualties3 = \n| notes       = Violence led large number of Jews, Czechs and anti-fascist Germans to flee from borderlands further to inland Czechoslovakia.

Among them was a number of Freikorps members, who used the commotion and got right to the two Gendarme officers on duty and disarmed them. The mob released the two officers and continued towards the town center. After briefing the two disarmed Gendarme officers, SDG squad leader Josef Nov\u00e1k contacted the town's mayor, an ethnic-German G\u00f6bel, who promised that he will negotiate return of the Gendarme's firearms. Officers Nov\u00e1k and Posp\u00ed\u0161il left SDG station and went towards the town center, now in hands of Freikorps. There, they were both immediately attacked and lynched to death. Before dying, Posp\u00ed\u0161il tossed away a hand grenade, wounding several assailants. Later that day Freikorps members lynched to death also an ethnic-German communist Fitz. Groups of heavily armed Freikorps started taking over the whole town. Remaining SDG members and Gendarme officers decided to lay covering fire and evacuate several civilians as well as themselves towards train station. There they fortified several wagons and drove away. Meanwhile, however, Freikorps blocked the railway line leading to the next train station in [[Velk\u00e1 Kra\u0161]] and took positions in a school building overlooking the line. After the train stopped before the blockage just in front of the school, Freikorps opened fire from rifles and started tossing hand grenades. The train occupants ran away from the building and train towards fields, leaving behind one dead civilian and two wounded SDG members and several wounded civilians, who were captured by Freikorps and delivered to Germany. There they were first treated and later released. The rest managed to get away and under constant covering fire reached the train station in Velk\u00e1 Kra\u0161. Here, Freikorps leader Latzel first persisted that the SDG personnel must surrender. The SDG squad, now consisting of 13 seriously wounded and a few lightly wounded members, refused and stated the intent to either get further inland or die trying.

The idea has a number of trajectories including Swedish researcher, Gunnar T\u00f6rnqvist\u2019s notion of the \u2018creative milieu\u2019 - a term first used by Hippolyte Taine, Philippe Aydalot and colleagues investigations of innovative milieux at Gremi.<ref>T\u00f6rnqvist, G., 1983.

The creative city. In: J. Leed ed. The Creative City. Themed issue of Meanjin, 47, 4.</ref> According to this seminar Yencken argued that \"cities must be efficient and fair but also committed to fostering creativity among its citizens and to providing emotionally satisfying places and experiences for them\". Charles Landry and his colleagues at Comedia from the late 1980s onwards established the notion as a practical urban policy tool that saw creativity as a resource for urban development. This included the imagination of artists, scientists, businesses, ordinary people as well as the civic creativity of public officials defined as imaginative problem solving applied to public good objectives.<ref>Landry, Charles: An Advanced Introduction to the Creative City, Edward Elgar publishing, Cheltenham, 2019</ref>\n\n==Creativity and imagination in city making==\nThe Creative City proposed a new planning paradigm from which an at times contentious global movement emerged. The first attempt to implement the concept at city level was the 1991 study, Glasgow: The Creative City and its Cultural Economy undertaken by Comedia,<ref>{{cite web |title=Making the Most of Glasgow's Cultural Assets |url=https://www.understandingglasgow.com/assets/0000/5037/MAKING_THE_MOST_OF_GLASGOW_S_CULTURAL_ASSETS_vpdf.pdf |website=understandingglasgow.com}}</ref> followed in 1995 by a study on urban creativity in 10 cities called ''The Creative City in Britain and Germany''.<ref>Landry Charles, Bianchini Franco, Ebert Ralf, Gnad Fritz.

Its philosophy is that there is always more creative potential in a place. It posits that conditions need to be created for people to think, plan and act with imagination in harnessing opportunities or addressing seemingly intractable urban problems. It was a response to the dramatic economic, social and cultural transformations across the globe from the early 1980s onwards that required a re-assessment of cities' resources and potential.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://charleslandry.com/panel/wp-content/uploads/downloads/2013/03/Lineages-of-the-Creative-City.pdf|title=Lineages of the Creative City|last=|first=|date=|website=charleslandry.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>Creative infrastructure is a combination of the hard and the soft. The latter includes a city's mindset, how it approaches opportunities and problems; its atmosphere and incentives and regulatory regime. The soft infrastructure includes: A highly skilled and flexible labour force; dynamic thinkers, creators and implementers. It is not only artists or creative economy participants who are creative. It can anyone who addresses issues in an inventive way be it a social worker, a business person, a scientist or public servant. A culture of creativity is seen as crucial in how urban stakeholders operate. By encouraging and legitimizing the use of imagination within the public, private and community spheres, the ideas bank of possibilities and potential solutions to any urban problem will be broadened. The aim is to identify, nurture, attract and sustain talent so as to mobilize ideas, talents, and creative organizations with an appropriate set built environment and help to establish a creative milieu.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Araya|first=Daniel|url=https://books.google.com.eg/books?id=6L-UNaQk1iwC&pg=PA366&lpg=PA366&dq=A+culture+of+creativity+is+seen+as+crucial+in+how+urban+stakeholders+operate.+By+encouraging+and+legitimizing+the+use+of+imagination+within+the+public,+private+and+community+spheres,+the+ideas+bank+of+possibilities+and+potential+solutions+to+any+urban+problem+will+be+broadened.&source=bl&ots=uJYiiNm5RY&sig=ACfU3U2J_8Xia2FsJDR27mDG7vri5DUzTg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi18dnm2bvoAhUr4YUKHdyOCGsQ6AEwAHoECAoQAQ#v=onepage&q=A%20culture%20of%20creativity%20is%20seen%20as%20crucial%20in%20how%20urban%20stakeholders%20operate.%20By%20encouraging%20and%20legitimizing%20the%20use%20of%20imagination%20within%20the%20public,%20private%20and%20community%20spheres,|title=Education in the Creative Economy: Knowledge and Learning in the Age of Innovation|last2=Peters|first2=Michael A.|date=2010|publisher=Peter Lang|isbn=978-1-4331-0744-3|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://urbact.eu/sites/default/files/creative_spirits_state_of_the_art.pdf|title=Creative Spirits|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==Early developments==\nPartners for Livable Places ''\"later Communities\"'' founded in 1977 was important in the early stages of the creative city idea.

From the late 1970s onwards [[UNESCO]] and the [[Council of Europe]] began to investigate the cultural resources and their associated industries. From the perspective of cities it was Nick Garnham, who when seconded to the [[Greater London Council]] in 1983/4 set up a [[cultural industries]] unit put the cultural industries on the agenda.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://glcstory.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/GLC-R.I.P.-Cultural-Policies-in-London.pdf|title=Bianchini Franco, GLC R.I.P.

These are embodied in peoples' histories, skills, the repertoire of local assets and a city\u2019s physical landscape. It was introduced into the English speaking world by Franco Bianchini in 1990,<ref>Cultural Policy and Urban Development: the Experience of West European Cities and Its Implications for the EC, report for Directorate General XVI of the European Commission (August 1990).</ref><ref>Cultural Policy and Urban Regeneration: The West European Experience, Eds.

American Council for the Arts Synopsis von Eckhardt 1980</ref> Mercer added cultural planning has to be \"the strategic and integral use of cultural resources in urban and community development.\" Bianchini elaborated the term cultural resource in collaborative work with Landry. They stated: \"Cultural resources are the raw materials of the city and its value base; its assets replacing coal, steel or gold. Creativity is the method of exploiting these resources and helping them grow.\" This focus draws attention to the distinctive, the unique and the special in any place.\n\n==The emergence of the creative economy and creative class==\nThroughout the 1990s and the 2000s, the creative city concept was to some extent hijacked by a focus on the creative industries so losing sight of its larger aims that in periods of \u201ctransformation it is necessary to create the conditions for people, organizations and cities to think, plan and act with imagination to solve problems and create opportunities\u201d.<ref>Landry, Charles: An Advanced Introduction to the Creative City, Edward Elgar publishing, Cheltenham, 2019</ref> In the late 1980s, at its origins, it had focused on the role of artists and sectors like design, new media, music, film or performing arts as well as the associated cultural infrastructure like museums or galleries. They were important in maintaining local distinctiveness given the structural changes at that time and their role in establishing identity and belonging.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ub.edu/escult/epolis/liverpool/LiverpoolBook.pdf|title=The Role of museums and the arts in the urban regeneration of Liverpool.

The core notion advocated a culture of creativity to be embedded into how the urban stakeholders operate stressing that by encouraging and legitimising the use of imagination in all spheres the ideasbank of possibilities and potential solutions broadens. Creativity is context driven. What was \u2018creative\u2019 in the 19th or 20th century will be different from what is creative in the 21<sup>st</sup>.

In other words, Florida's prescriptions in favour of fostering a creative class are, rather than being revolutionary, simply a way of bolstering the conventional economic model of the city. The idea of the creative class serves to create a cultural hierarchy, and as such reproduce inequalities; indeed, even Florida himself has even acknowledged that the areas he himself touts as hotspots of the creative class are at the same time home to shocking disparities in economic status among their residents. In order to explain this, he points to the inflation of housing prices that an influx of creatives can bring to an area, as well as to the creative class' reliance on service industries that typically pay their employees low wages.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Peck|first=Jamie|date=2005|title=Struggling with the Creative Class|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1468-2427.2005.00620.x|journal=International Journal of Urban and Regional Research|language=en|volume=29|issue=4|pages=740\u2013770|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2427.2005.00620.x|issn=1468-2427}}</ref> \n\nCritics argue that the creative city idea has now become a catch-all phrase in danger of losing its meaning and in danger of hollowing out by general overuse of the word \u2018creative\u2019 as applied to people, activities, organizations, urban neighborhoods or cities that objectively are not especially creative. Cities still tend to restrict its meaning to the arts and cultural activities within the [[Creative industries|creative economy]] professions, calling any cultural plan a creative city plan, when such activities are only one aspect of a community's creativity. There is a tendency for cities to adopt the term without thinking through its real organizational consequences and the need to change their mindset. The creativity implied in the term, the creative city, is about lateral and integrative thinking in all aspects of city planning and urban development, placing people, not infrastructure, at the centre of planning processes.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hartley|first=John|url=https://books.google.com.eg/books?id=sMnj88kYVmcC&pg=PT59&lpg=PT59&dq=creative+city+losing+losing+its+meaning&source=bl&ots=kryyc36noV&sig=ACfU3U2CKZUPZsDlBdILLsRuOOs4G0IbFw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi61fax87voAhVsQUEAHfFhBIwQ6AEwAHoECAUQAQ#v=onepage&q=creative%20city%20losing%20losing%20its%20meaning&f=false|title=Key Concepts in Creative Industries|last2=Potts|first2=Jason|last3=Flew|first3=Terry|last4=Cunningham|first4=Stuart|last5=Keane|first5=Michael|last6=Banks|first6=John|date=2012-11-19|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-1-4462-0289-0|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe original Creative City vision of Landry has been almost entirely superseded by a Florida-based vision framed by economic innovation and its requisite skilled labour. The Creative City in many places has become a business project, not a framework for total urban policy transformation. It has scaled down its expectations, and no longer demands that urban policy develop a creative imagination. The \u201cthesis\u201d can be implemented as strategy without unsettling too many ruling assumptions on the role of cities in the global economic order. The debate about creative city still contains the two strands - the more holistic notion of comprehensive urban creativity and those that deem that the creative economy largely represents what a creative city is.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Damme|first=Ilja Van|url=https://books.google.com.eg/books?id=ni82DwAAQBAJ&pg=PT70&lpg=PT70&dq=The+original+Creative+City+vision+of+Landry+has+been+almost+entirely+superseded+by+a+Florida-based+vision+framed+by+economic+innovation+and+its+requisite+skilled+labor.+The+Creative+City+in+many+places+has+become+a+business+project,+not+a+framework+for+total+urban+policy+transformation.+It+has+scaled+down+its+expectations,+and+no+longer+demands+that+urban+policy+develop+a+creative+imagination.+The+%E2%80%9Cthesis%E2%80%9D+can+be+implemented+as+strategy+without+unsettling+too+many+ruling+assumptions+on+the+role+of+cities+in+the+global+economic+order.&source=bl&ots=ke1nR3KH4H&sig=ACfU3U3lIkYtMqRUpV_pDmHamLE1cO80zg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjmkcCl3ejoAhXmAGMBHYhgBncQ6AEwAHoECAsQKA#v=onepage&q=The%20original%20Creative%20City%20vision%20of%20Landry%20has%20been%20almost%20entirely%20superseded%20by%20a%20Florida-based%20vision%20framed%20by%20economic%20innovation%20and%20its%20requisite%20skilled%20labor.%20The%20Creative%20City%20in%20many%20places%20has%20become%20a%20business%20project,%20not%20a%20framework%20for%20total%20urban%20policy%20transformation.%20It%20has%20scaled%20down%20its%20expectations,%20and%20no%20longer%20demands%20that%20urban%20policy%20develop%20a%20creative%20imagination.%20The%20%E2%80%9Cthesis%E2%80%9D%20can%20be%20implemented%20as%20strategy%20without%20unsettling%20too%20many%20ruling%20assumptions%20on%20the%20role%20of%20cities%20in%20the%20global%20economic%20order.&f=false|title=Cities and Creativity from the Renaissance to the Present|last2=Munck|first2=Bert De|last3=Miles|first3=Andrew|date=2017-09-18|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-351-68179-7|language=en}}</ref><ref>Vickery, John: Creative Cities and Public Cultures: Art, Democracy and Urban Lives, Taylor Francis, Abingdon, 2020</ref>\n\n==Recent developments==\nStarting from the 2000s onwards, many cities across the globe developed creative city strategies most focusing on the culture and creative economy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.unesco.org/creative-cities/home|title=Creative Cities {{!}} Creative Cities Network|website=en.unesco.org|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://urbact.eu/sites/default/files/import/Projects/Creative_Clusters/documents_media/URBACTCreativeClusters_TAP_INTELI_Final_01.pdf|title=Creative Clusters|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Recent work by Landry has sought to refocus on the importance of civic creativity and the creative bureaucracy,<ref>{{Cite book|last=|first=|url=https://charleslandry.com/panel/wp-content/themes/twentyeleven/books/The-Creative-Bureaucracy.pdf|title=The Creative Bureaucracy & its radical common sense with Margie Caust (2017)|publisher=|year=|isbn=978-1-908777-08-9|location=|pages=}}</ref> defined as imaginative problem solving applied to public good and public interest objectives, where urban creativity needs an aim and an ethical frame.

The creative city. In: J. Leed ed. The Creative City. Themed issue of Meanjin, 47, 4.</ref> According to this seminar Yencken argued that \"cities must be efficient and fair but also committed to fostering creativity among its citizens and to providing emotionally satisfying places and experiences for them\". Charles Landry and his colleagues at Comedia from the late 1980s onwards established the notion as a practical urban policy tool that saw creativity as a resource for urban development. This included the imagination of artists, scientists, businesses, ordinary people as well as the civic creativity of public officials defined as imaginative problem solving applied to public good objectives.<ref>Landry, Charles: An Advanced Introduction to the Creative City, Edward Elgar publishing, Cheltenham, 2019</ref>\n\n==Creativity and imagination in city making==\nThe Creative City proposed a new planning paradigm from which an at times contentious global movement emerged.

Its philosophy is that there is always more creative potential in a place. It posits that conditions need to be created for people to think, plan and act with imagination in harnessing opportunities or addressing seemingly intractable urban problems. It was a response to the dramatic economic, social and cultural transformations across the globe from the early 1980s onwards that required a re-assessment of cities' resources and potential.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://charleslandry.com/panel/wp-content/uploads/downloads/2013/03/Lineages-of-the-Creative-City.pdf|title=Lineages of the Creative City|last=|first=|date=|website=charleslandry.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>Creative infrastructure is a combination of the hard and the soft. The latter includes a city's mindset, how it approaches opportunities and problems; its atmosphere and incentives and regulatory regime. The soft infrastructure includes: A highly skilled and flexible labour force; dynamic thinkers, creators and implementers. It is not only artists or creative economy participants who are creative. It can anyone who addresses issues in an inventive way be it a social worker, a business person, a scientist or public servant. A culture of creativity is seen as crucial in how urban stakeholders operate. By encouraging and legitimizing the use of imagination within the public, private and community spheres, the ideas bank of possibilities and potential solutions to any urban problem will be broadened. The aim is to identify, nurture, attract and sustain talent so as to mobilize ideas, talents, and creative organizations with an appropriate set built environment and help to establish a creative milieu.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Araya|first=Daniel|url=https://books.google.com.eg/books?id=6L-UNaQk1iwC&pg=PA366&lpg=PA366&dq=A+culture+of+creativity+is+seen+as+crucial+in+how+urban+stakeholders+operate.+By+encouraging+and+legitimizing+the+use+of+imagination+within+the+public,+private+and+community+spheres,+the+ideas+bank+of+possibilities+and+potential+solutions+to+any+urban+problem+will+be+broadened.&source=bl&ots=uJYiiNm5RY&sig=ACfU3U2J_8Xia2FsJDR27mDG7vri5DUzTg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi18dnm2bvoAhUr4YUKHdyOCGsQ6AEwAHoECAoQAQ#v=onepage&q=A%20culture%20of%20creativity%20is%20seen%20as%20crucial%20in%20how%20urban%20stakeholders%20operate.%20By%20encouraging%20and%20legitimizing%20the%20use%20of%20imagination%20within%20the%20public,%20private%20and%20community%20spheres,|title=Education in the Creative Economy: Knowledge and Learning in the Age of Innovation|last2=Peters|first2=Michael A.|date=2010|publisher=Peter Lang|isbn=978-1-4331-0744-3|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://urbact.eu/sites/default/files/creative_spirits_state_of_the_art.pdf|title=Creative Spirits|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==Early developments==\nPartners for Livable Places ''\"later Communities\"'' founded in 1977 was important in the early stages of the creative city idea.

From the late 1970s onwards [[UNESCO]] and the [[Council of Europe]] began to investigate the cultural resources and their associated industries. From the perspective of cities it was Nick Garnham, who when seconded to the [[Greater London Council]] in 1983/4 set up a [[cultural industries]] unit put the cultural industries on the agenda.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://glcstory.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/GLC-R.I.P.-Cultural-Policies-in-London.pdf|title=Bianchini Franco, GLC R.I.P.

These are embodied in peoples' histories, skills, the repertoire of local assets and a city\u2019s physical landscape. It was introduced into the English speaking world by Franco Bianchini in 1990,<ref>Cultural Policy and Urban Development: the Experience of West European Cities and Its Implications for the EC, report for Directorate General XVI of the European Commission (August 1990).</ref><ref>Cultural Policy and Urban Regeneration: The West European Experience, Eds.

American Council for the Arts Synopsis von Eckhardt 1980</ref> Mercer added cultural planning has to be \"the strategic and integral use of cultural resources in urban and community development.\" Bianchini elaborated the term cultural resource in collaborative work with Landry. They stated: \"Cultural resources are the raw materials of the city and its value base; its assets replacing coal, steel or gold. Creativity is the method of exploiting these resources and helping them grow.\" This focus draws attention to the distinctive, the unique and the special in any place.\n\n==The emergence of the creative economy and creative class==\nThroughout the 1990s and the 2000s, the creative city concept was to some extent hijacked by a focus on the creative industries so losing sight of its larger aims that in periods of \u201ctransformation it is necessary to create the conditions for people, organizations and cities to think, plan and act with imagination to solve problems and create opportunities\u201d.<ref>Landry, Charles: An Advanced Introduction to the Creative City, Edward Elgar publishing, Cheltenham, 2019</ref> In the late 1980s, at its origins, it had focused on the role of artists and sectors like design, new media, music, film or performing arts as well as the associated cultural infrastructure like museums or galleries.

Creativity is context driven. What was \u2018creative\u2019 in the 19th or 20th century will be different from what is creative in the 21<sup>st</sup>.

A valid concern has been the conscious use of artists to be the vanguard of gentrification, to lift property values and to make areas safe before others move in this is artwashing.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://colouringinculture.org/blog/artwashingsocialcapitalantigentrification|title=Artwashing: Social Capital & Anti-Gentrification Activism|website=COLOURING IN CULTURE|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref>\n\nFlorida's work has been criticized by scholars such as Jamie Peck as, \"work[ing] quietly with the grain of extant 'neoliberal' development agendas, framed around interurban competition, gentrification, middle-class consumption and place-marketing\". In other words, Florida's prescriptions in favour of fostering a creative class are, rather than being revolutionary, simply a way of bolstering the conventional economic model of the city. The idea of the creative class serves to create a cultural hierarchy, and as such reproduce inequalities; indeed, even Florida himself has even acknowledged that the areas he himself touts as hotspots of the creative class are at the same time home to shocking disparities in economic status among their residents. In order to explain this, he points to the inflation of housing prices that an influx of creatives can bring to an area, as well as to the creative class' reliance on service industries that typically pay their employees low wages.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Peck|first=Jamie|date=2005|title=Struggling with the Creative Class|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1468-2427.2005.00620.x|journal=International Journal of Urban and Regional Research|language=en|volume=29|issue=4|pages=740\u2013770|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2427.2005.00620.x|issn=1468-2427}}</ref> \n\nCritics argue that the creative city idea has now become a catch-all phrase in danger of losing its meaning and in danger of hollowing out by general overuse of the word \u2018creative\u2019 as applied to people, activities, organizations, urban neighborhoods or cities that objectively are not especially creative. Cities still tend to restrict its meaning to the arts and cultural activities within the [[Creative industries|creative economy]] professions, calling any cultural plan a creative city plan, when such activities are only one aspect of a community's creativity. There is a tendency for cities to adopt the term without thinking through its real organizational consequences and the need to change their mindset. The creativity implied in the term, the creative city, is about lateral and integrative thinking in all aspects of city planning and urban development, placing people, not infrastructure, at the centre of planning processes.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hartley|first=John|url=https://books.google.com.eg/books?id=sMnj88kYVmcC&pg=PT59&lpg=PT59&dq=creative+city+losing+losing+its+meaning&source=bl&ots=kryyc36noV&sig=ACfU3U2CKZUPZsDlBdILLsRuOOs4G0IbFw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi61fax87voAhVsQUEAHfFhBIwQ6AEwAHoECAUQAQ#v=onepage&q=creative%20city%20losing%20losing%20its%20meaning&f=false|title=Key Concepts in Creative Industries|last2=Potts|first2=Jason|last3=Flew|first3=Terry|last4=Cunningham|first4=Stuart|last5=Keane|first5=Michael|last6=Banks|first6=John|date=2012-11-19|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-1-4462-0289-0|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe original Creative City vision of Landry has been almost entirely superseded by a Florida-based vision framed by economic innovation and its requisite skilled labour. The Creative City in many places has become a business project, not a framework for total urban policy transformation. It has scaled down its expectations, and no longer demands that urban policy develop a creative imagination. The \u201cthesis\u201d can be implemented as strategy without unsettling too many ruling assumptions on the role of cities in the global economic order. The debate about creative city still contains the two strands - the more holistic notion of comprehensive urban creativity and those that deem that the creative economy largely represents what a creative city is.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Damme|first=Ilja Van|url=https://books.google.com.eg/books?id=ni82DwAAQBAJ&pg=PT70&lpg=PT70&dq=The+original+Creative+City+vision+of+Landry+has+been+almost+entirely+superseded+by+a+Florida-based+vision+framed+by+economic+innovation+and+its+requisite+skilled+labor.+The+Creative+City+in+many+places+has+become+a+business+project,+not+a+framework+for+total+urban+policy+transformation.+It+has+scaled+down+its+expectations,+and+no+longer+demands+that+urban+policy+develop+a+creative+imagination.+The+%E2%80%9Cthesis%E2%80%9D+can+be+implemented+as+strategy+without+unsettling+too+many+ruling+assumptions+on+the+role+of+cities+in+the+global+economic+order.&source=bl&ots=ke1nR3KH4H&sig=ACfU3U3lIkYtMqRUpV_pDmHamLE1cO80zg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjmkcCl3ejoAhXmAGMBHYhgBncQ6AEwAHoECAsQKA#v=onepage&q=The%20original%20Creative%20City%20vision%20of%20Landry%20has%20been%20almost%20entirely%20superseded%20by%20a%20Florida-based%20vision%20framed%20by%20economic%20innovation%20and%20its%20requisite%20skilled%20labor.%20The%20Creative%20City%20in%20many%20places%20has%20become%20a%20business%20project,%20not%20a%20framework%20for%20total%20urban%20policy%20transformation.%20It%20has%20scaled%20down%20its%20expectations,%20and%20no%20longer%20demands%20that%20urban%20policy%20develop%20a%20creative%20imagination.%20The%20%E2%80%9Cthesis%E2%80%9D%20can%20be%20implemented%20as%20strategy%20without%20unsettling%20too%20many%20ruling%20assumptions%20on%20the%20role%20of%20cities%20in%20the%20global%20economic%20order.&f=false|title=Cities and Creativity from the Renaissance to the Present|last2=Munck|first2=Bert De|last3=Miles|first3=Andrew|date=2017-09-18|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-351-68179-7|language=en}}</ref><ref>Vickery, John: Creative Cities and Public Cultures: Art, Democracy and Urban Lives, Taylor Francis, Abingdon, 2020</ref>\n\n==Recent developments==\nStarting from the 2000s onwards, many cities across the globe developed creative city strategies most focusing on the culture and creative economy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.unesco.org/creative-cities/home|title=Creative Cities {{!}} Creative Cities Network|website=en.unesco.org|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://urbact.eu/sites/default/files/import/Projects/Creative_Clusters/documents_media/URBACTCreativeClusters_TAP_INTELI_Final_01.pdf|title=Creative Clusters|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Recent work by Landry has sought to refocus on the importance of civic creativity and the creative bureaucracy,<ref>{{Cite book|last=|first=|url=https://charleslandry.com/panel/wp-content/themes/twentyeleven/books/The-Creative-Bureaucracy.pdf|title=The Creative Bureaucracy & its radical common sense with Margie Caust (2017)|publisher=|year=|isbn=978-1-908777-08-9|location=|pages=}}</ref> defined as imaginative problem solving applied to public good and public interest objectives, where urban creativity needs an aim and an ethical frame.
