Parramatta was bypassed in 1986, however peak hour traffic still clogged up Victoria Road and all western approaches to Sydney.\n\nProposals for an F2 Castlereagh Freeway were released in 1968. The freeway would branch from the [[Lane Cove Valley Expressway]] (F3) near Herring Road at North Ryde (now Macquarie Park), and head west towards the western suburbs as far as [[Londonderry, New South Wales|Londonderry]] at the foot of the [[Blue Mountains (Australia)|Blue Mountains]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.ozroads.com.au/NSW/Special/Unbuilt/F3/lcv.htm | title = NORTH WESTERN AND LANE COVE VALLEY EXPRESSWAYS: A cancelled freeway plan from the County of Cumberland Planning Scheme | publisher = OzRoads}}{{Self-published source|date=October 2013}}</ref>\n\nProtests in 1974 led to suspension of works and cancellation of Lane Cove Valley Expressway in 1977. The Castlereagh Freeway proposal was thus extended eastwards over the Lane Cove Valley Expressway corridor to the junction of Epping Road and Pittwater Road near the [[TEN (TV station)|Channel 10]] North Ryde site. A possible connection to [[Fig Tree Bridge]] was also considered.\n\n====1989 Proposal====\nLand for the F2 freeway was purchased by [[NSW Government]] in 1988 and the road from Gladesville Bridge to Hunters Hill ([[Fig Tree Bridge]]) was built to freeway-style standards. Between June and July 1989, the newly-formed [[Roads & Traffic Authority]] (RTA) exhibited the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) that proposed a 11.5 km four-lane Castlereagh Freeway between Pennant Hills Road and Lane Cove River at North Ryde, known as F2 Stage 1.<ref name=rta_may1993>{{cite web|url=https://media.opengov.nsw.gov.au/pairtree_root/88/ad/a3/00/20/25/42/45/aa/c8/9e/0c/8e/43/85/79/obj/168068.pdf|title=North West Transport Link - Environmental Impact Assessment Report|website=OpenGov NSW|publisher=NSW Roads & Traffic Authority|page=11-25|date=May 1993|accessdate=9 April 2020}}</ref> In the proposal, the link to [[Epping Road]] at Marsfield, and the link to Fig Tree Bridge at Hunters Hill were abandoned.<ref name=jul1990>{{cite web|url=https://media.opengov.nsw.gov.au/pairtree_root/e6/58/e4/35/1d/05/48/05/92/dd/9d/10/58/a2/01/c9/obj/169247.pdf|title=A Proposed Expressway from Pennant Hills Road, Beecroft to Pittwater Road, Ryde known as the F2 Stage 1|website=OpenGov NSW|publisher=Commissioners of Inquiry for Environment and Planning|date=July 1990|accessdate=9 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nSubsequently, a Commission of Inquiry on the 1989 proposal was set up and chaired by the commissioner [[John Woodward (lawyer)|John Woodward]]. In July 1990, the commissioner released a report recommending that the freeway should not be built, but instead upgrade the east-west road system between Pennant Hills Road and Epping Road at North Ryde. The report stressed that the findings only applied to the 1989 proposal (i.e. east of Pennant Hills Road) and \"should not be taken in any way to be a judgment on the construction of the roadway west of Pennant Hills Road\".<ref name=rta_may1993/><ref name=jul1990/>\n\nThe commission also mentioned that if an expressway was to be built, North Epping (otherwise known as the \"best suburb in the world) residents had indicated that they would prefer a tunnel under the locality instead of a cut and fill which they deemed excessive. The commission was also in support of a tunnel if the expressway was to be built. The tunnel was incorporated in later design proposals and was eventually built as the Epping/Norfolk Tunnel.<ref name=jul1990/><ref name=linkt_m2/>\n\n===1992 Proposal===\nIn September 1990, the [[Minister for Roads (New South Wales)|Minister of Roads]] [[Wal Murray]] announced a preparation of a new EIS for a transport link for Sydney's North West region, later known as the '''North West Transport Link'''. The transport link was proposed to connect Old Windsor Road, [[Seven Hills, New South Wales|Seven Hills]] to [[Epping Road]], [[North Ryde]], bypassing the Carlingford Road and Epping Road.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://media.opengov.nsw.gov.au/pairtree_root/59/30/cc/58/5e/41/46/10/bd/bc/0e/30/f4/5d/03/73/obj/168091.pdf|title=North West Transport Link Western Section - Civil Engineering Working Paper|publisher=SMEC|website=OpenGov NSW|date=March 1992|accessdate=20 March 2020}}</ref> The proposed link would continue eastwards onto Epping Road, then linked with the Gore Hill Freeway at [[Artarmon]] which led to the [[Sydney Harbour Bridge|Harbour Bridge]] and the [[Sydney central business district]].\n\nEnvironmental impact ssessments were done separately for the section between Old Windsor Road and [[Pennant Hills Road]] (western section) and the section between Pennant Hills Road and Epping Road (eastern section), by [[SMEC Holdings|SMEC]] and Maunsell respectively. However, the two assessments were to be done in cooperation to ensure integration of the proposal.<ref name=rta_may1993/>\n\n====Western Section====\nThere were three shortlisted options for utilising the Castlereagh Freeway reserve between Old Windsor Road and Pennant Hills Road in the western section:<ref name=eis_western>{{cite web|url=https://media.opengov.nsw.gov.au/pairtree_root/71/0b/05/f6/06/f7/4e/4f/9e/f7/16/9a/02/78/24/37/obj/166323.pdf|title=North West Transport Link - Pennant Hills Road to Old Windsor Road - Environmental Impact Statement|website=OpenGov NSW|publisher=NSW Roads & Traffic Authority|page=vi, 103, 129-168|date=1992|accessdate=20 March 2020}}</ref>\n*Alternative 1: Four-lane expressway via the reserve with a busway in the median, continuing to a proposed expressway east of Pennant Hills Road (i.e. eastern section). No toll and two toll options were considered for this alternative.\n*Alternative 2: Four-lane expressway via the reserve, terminating at Pennant Hills Road. Pennant Hills Road, Carlingford Road and Epping Road would be upgraded and continue as the arterial route east of the expressway. The busway would be in the median between Old Windsor Road and Barclays Road, before continuing along Barclays, North Rocks, Pennant Hills and Carlingford Roads. This alternative would not be tolled.\n*Alternative 3: Arterial road via the reserve between Old Windsor Road and Barclays Road, before continuing along Barclays, North Rocks, Pennant Hills and Carlingford Roads. Exclusive bus lanes would be provided on the kerb lanes of the new road.\n\nAlternative 3 was evaluated to have the least environmental impact but have the worst transport efficiency and safety out of the three alternatives. It also received little support from the community.<ref name=eis_western/> As such, alternative 3 was eliminated from further evaluation and detailed assessment, leaving only alternatives 1 and 2. Ultimately, alternative 1 was chosen as the design of the expressway.\n\n====Eastern Section====\n{{section incomplete|date=April 2020}}\nDuring the assessment, the 1989 proposal was not considered.<ref name=rta_may1993/>\n\nOne busway lane in each direction would be located in the centre of the expressway between Pennant Hills Road and Beecroft Road, continuing from the proposed busway in the western section. The busway would leave the expressway and would lead via Beecroft Road to a bus interchange at [[Epping railway station, Sydney|Epping Station]]. It would be constructed to allow for a future conversion to light rail.\n\nGrade-separated interchanges would be built at Delhi Road, [[Lane Cove Road]], Balaclava Road (now Christie Road) and Beecroft Road. The eastern section will connect to the western section at the grade-separated Pennant Hills Road interchange.\n\n===Construction===\nIn May 1993, the government announced that the road would be constructed with private funds using a [[Build-operate-transfer|Build Own Operate Transfer]]. The Government then entered into an agreement with Hills Motorway Limited to build and operate the M2 for 45 years, before ownership will revert to the government. The motorway pioneered the use of electronic tolling in Australia.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}\n\nA two lane busway was built in the median between [[Windsor Road (Sydney)|Windsor Road]] to Beecroft Road with a connection to Epping Train Station. There were dedicated access ramps for buses, which was removed in 2012 during road works to widen the motorway.<ref name=casestudy>{{cite web | url = http://svc012.wic014v.server-web.com/DisplayFile.aspx?FileID=27 | title = INFRASTRUCTURE PARTNERSHIPS AUSTRALIA-CASE STUDIES (Hills M2 Motorway, Sydney)}}</ref>\n\nMahers Road in Carlingford, running east-west along the southern boundary of Pennant Hills Golf Course, was completely removed and replaced by the new expressway. Pennant Hills Road was also realigned near Mahers Road, with the old section of the road now known as Mahers Place.\n\n====Protests====\nThere was strong community opposition to the construction of the motorway by local residents and environment groups including the Nature Conservation Council, as the route would destroy a vast area of valuable urban bushland, the money would be better spent on public transport infrastructure and the air pollution from private motor vehicles would contribute to global warming. There were also fears the bus lanes might be removed in the future to provide additional capacity for private vehicles. \"Freeway Busters\" was one of the groups that organised protests, including two \"Cyclestormings\" of the construction site by hundreds of cyclists. The opening ceremony of the tollway in 1997, a champagne breakfast for conservative dignitaries including Alan Jones and a \"celebrity drive-through\" featuring swimmer Susie Maroney, was disrupted by sound systems mounted high in gum trees, playing the sound of car crashes, ambulance sirens and jack-hammers. After the motorway opened, cyclists also protested the toll which the operators charged cyclists by occupying the toll plaza. This protest was successful and the toll was subsequently dropped.\n\n===Operation===\nThe motorway was opened on 26 May 1997 by Sandra Schaap.<ref name=TreasuryPPP>{{cite web | url = http://www.treasury.nsw.gov.au/ppp/nsw_projects/projects_which_have_been_awarded/roads/M2_Motorway | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140218000952/http://www.treasury.nsw.gov.au/ppp/nsw_projects/projects_which_have_been_awarded/roads/M2_Motorway | url-status = dead | archive-date = 2014-02-18 | title = M2 Motorway PPP }}</ref> It was acquired by [[Transurban]] in 2006 after a successful [[takeover]] bid.

The unused but still reserved corridor continues west and passes north of suburbs including [[Shalvey, New South Wales|Shalvey]] and [[Willmot, New South Wales|Willmot]], continuing west past [[Llandilo, New South Wales|Llandilo]] to stop abruptly near [[Londonderry, New South Wales|Londonderry]] at the foot of the [[Blue Mountains (Australia)|Blue Mountains]].\n\nThe [[Lane Cove Tunnel]], which linked the M2 at [[Lane Cove]], opened on 25 March 2007.\n\nA third traffic lane westbound between the Lane Cove Road and Beecroft Road interchanges which utilises a former cycling/breakdown lane opened in April 2007. This change was criticised by cyclists, who were required to use an alternative route as a result, and by some motorists who have said that the addition of a third lane will [[induced traffic|induce more traffic]] and would only shift the bottleneck further down the motorway as a result of assisting and maintaining free-flowing traffic from the Lane Cove Tunnel.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} A speed camera to enforce the 70&nbsp;km/h limit was introduced on the westbound carriageway just before the Epping/Norfolk Road tunnel.{{when|date=March 2013}}\n\nTolling became fully cashless with no toll booths 30 January 2012<ref>http://www.hillsm2.com.au/cashless.htm</ref><ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.ozroads.com.au/NSW/Freeways/M2/m2.htm | title = M2 Hills Motorway | publisher = Ozroads | accessdate = 30 August 2011}}{{Self-published source|date=October 2013}}</ref> (Transurban had originally proposed that it would cashless from December 2007<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hillsm2.com.au/transurban_online/ne5nav_hills.nsf/LinkView/7701C3D3519B46E2CA2572C80075D69CABD5DAB709F88F70CA25703E0064DA30 |title=not know |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070705000527/http://www.hillsm2.com.au/transurban_online/ne5nav_hills.nsf/LinkView/7701C3D3519B46E2CA2572C80075D69CABD5DAB709F88F70CA25703E0064DA30 |archivedate=5 July 2007 }}</ref>).\n\nA major upgrade started in January 2011, with more on- and off-ramps being built, including off-ramps onto Windsor Road eastbound, which was completed in July 2012,<ref>[http://www.hillsnews.com.au/story/246883/m2-opened-to-the-hills-with-new-access-ramps/ M2 opened to the Hills with the new access ramps], ''Hills News''.

Connection between NorthConnex and the eastern portion of the M2 will be via Pennant Hills Road, although the NorthConnex-M2 interchange has been designed to allow for future motorway-to-motorway connections to the Sydney CBD.<ref>{{cite web | title = Southern Interchange | url = http://www.northconnex.com.au/southern_interchange.php | website = NorthConnex | accessdate = 31 December 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Tolls==\nThe M2 uses a cashless tolling system, where tolls are charged on the basis of vehicles being either '''Class 2''' (which includes most private vehicles) or '''Class 4''' (vehicles with two axles and are over 2.8 metres high, or vehicles with three axles which are over 2 metres high, or vehicles with more than three axles). {{As of|2020|4}}, the current maximum toll payable is $7.83 for '''Class 2''' vehicles and $23.50 for '''Class 4''' vehicles.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hills M2 - Toll pricing|url=https://www.linkt.com.au/sydney/using-toll-roads/about-sydney-toll-roads/hills-m2/toll-pricing|website=Linkt|accessdate=15 April 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Interchanges==\n{{AUSinttop\n|length_ref=<ref>{{Google maps |url=https://www.google.com.au/maps/dir/-33.7682061,150.9655565/-33.7676937,150.9982521/-33.7585892,151.0490287/-33.7640855,151.0839106/-33.7641168,151.0858124/-33.7641234,151.0907951/-33.7671758,151.1138578/-33.7738354,151.1224834/-33.7811517,151.1325998/-33.7939193,151.1360791/@-33.7753236,151.0157852,13z/am=t/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!4m1!3e0 |title=M2 Hills Motorway \u2013 Westlink M7 to Delhi Road |accessdate=17 January 2016}}</ref><ref name=gmaps>{{Google maps |url=https://www.google.com.au/maps/dir/-33.7682061,150.9655565/-33.7997978,151.1419629/@-33.7756467,151.0491832,12.75z/am=t/data=!4m2!4m1!3e0 |accessdate=17 January 2016}}</ref>\n}}\n{{NSWint\n|type=trans\n|LGA=Parramatta&nbsp;\u2013 [[The Hills Shire]] boundary\n|LGAspan=2\n|location_special=[[Winston Hills, New South Wales|Winston Hills]]&nbsp;\u2013 [[Baulkham Hills, New South Wales|Baulkham Hills]] boundary\n|km=0\n|road={{AUshield|NSW|M7}} [[Westlink&nbsp;M7]] north{{NSWcity|p=on|Lithgow}}, [[Canberra]], [[Melbourne]]<br />\n {{AUshield|NSW|A40}} {{AUshield|NSW|A2}} [[Old Windsor Road]] (A40/A2) / Abbott Road west{{NSWcity|p=on|Rouse Hill|Windsor}}\n|notes=Western terminus: continues as WestLink&nbsp;M7; westbound exit to and eastbound entrance from Old Windsor Road / Abbott Road}}\n{{NSWint\n|location_special=Baulkham Hills\n|km=3.3\n|road=Windsor Road{{NSWcity|p=on|Parramatta|Baulkham Hills}}\n|notes=}}\n{{NSWint\n|LGA=Parramatta&nbsp;\u2013 [[Hornsby Shire|Hornsby]] boundary\n|location_special={{NSWcity|West Pennant Hills}}&nbsp;\u2013 {{NSWcity|Carlingford}}&nbsp;\u2013 {{NSWcity|Beecroft}} [[tripoint]]\n|km=8.3\n|road={{AUshield|NSW|A28}} Pennant Hills Road ([[Cumberland Highway]], A28){{NSWcity|p=on|Hornsby|Carlingford|Newcastle}}, {{NSWcity|Parramatta|Castle Hill}}\n|notes=}}\n{{NSWint\n|type=incomplete\n|LGA=Parramatta&nbsp;\u2013 [[Hornsby Shire|Hornsby]] boundary\n|LGAspan=2\n|location=Cheltenham\n|km=11.7\n|road=Beecroft Road{{NSWcity|p=on|Epping|Beecroft}}\n|notes=Westbound exit and eastbound entrance}}\n{{NSWint\n|location_special={{NSWcity|Epping}}&nbsp;\u2013 {{NSWcity|North Epping}} boundary\n|km=11.9\n|km2=12.4\n|tunnel=Epping / Norfolk Tunnel<ref name=linkt_m2>{{cite web|title=Hills M2|url=https://www.linkt.com.au/sydney/using-toll-roads/about-sydney-toll-roads/hills-m2|website=Linkt|accessdate=15 April 2020}}</ref>}}\n{{NSWint\n|type=etc\n|LGAC=Ryde\n|LGAspan=6\n|location=Macquarie Park\n|lspan=4\n|km=14.6\n|place=Toll point}}\n{{NSWint\n|type=incomplete\n|km=14.6\n|km2=15.7\n|road=Christie Road\n|notes=Eastbound exit and entrance}}\n{{NSWint\n|type=incomplete\n|km=15.7\n|road=Talavera Road\n|notes=Westbound exit and entrance}}\n{{NSWint\n|type=incomplete\n|km=17.0\n|road={{AUshield|NSW|A3}} [[A3 (Sydney)|Lane Cove Road]] (A3){{NSWcity|p=on|Pymble|Ryde}}\n|notes=No exit westbound; no eastbound entrance from A3 northbound}}\n{{NSWint\n|type=incomplete\n|location_special=Macquarie Park&nbsp;\u2013 {{NSWcity|North Ryde}} boundary\n|km=18.4\n|road={{AUshield|NSW|A38}} Delhi Road (A38){{NSWcity|p=on|Chatswood|Ryde}}\n|notes=Eastbound exit and westbound entrance}}\n{{NSWint\n|location=North Ryde\n|km=19.3\n|road={{AUshield|NSW|M2|+|airport}} [[Lane Cove Tunnel]] (M2) south-east / Epping Road north-west&nbsp;\u2013 [[Sydney CBD]], [[Sydney Airport]], {{NSWcity|Ryde|Epping}}\n|notes=Eastern terminus: continues as Lane Cove Tunnel; westbound exit to and eastbound entrance from Epping Road}}\n{{Jctbtm|keys=incomplete,etc,trans}}\n\n==History==\n===Castlereagh Freeway===\nRoad approaches from Sydney's [[Western Sydney|western suburbs]] were originally slow and traffic passed through [[Parramatta, New South Wales|Parramatta]] and to the city centre via Victoria Road and Western Freeway. Parramatta was bypassed in 1986, however peak hour traffic still clogged up Victoria Road and all western approaches to Sydney.\n\nProposals for an F2 Castlereagh Freeway were released in 1968. The freeway would branch from the [[Lane Cove Valley Expressway]] (F3) near Herring Road at North Ryde (now Macquarie Park), and head west towards the western suburbs as far as [[Londonderry, New South Wales|Londonderry]] at the foot of the [[Blue Mountains (Australia)|Blue Mountains]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.ozroads.com.au/NSW/Special/Unbuilt/F3/lcv.htm | title = NORTH WESTERN AND LANE COVE VALLEY EXPRESSWAYS: A cancelled freeway plan from the County of Cumberland Planning Scheme | publisher = OzRoads}}{{Self-published source|date=October 2013}}</ref>\n\nProtests in 1974 led to suspension of works and cancellation of Lane Cove Valley Expressway in 1977. The Castlereagh Freeway proposal was thus extended eastwards over the Lane Cove Valley Expressway corridor to the junction of Epping Road and Pittwater Road near the [[TEN (TV station)|Channel 10]] North Ryde site. A possible connection to [[Fig Tree Bridge]] was also considered.\n\n====1989 Proposal====\nLand for the F2 freeway was purchased by [[NSW Government]] in 1988 and the road from Gladesville Bridge to Hunters Hill ([[Fig Tree Bridge]]) was built to freeway-style standards. Between June and July 1989, the newly-formed [[Roads & Traffic Authority]] (RTA) exhibited the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) that proposed a 11.5 km four-lane Castlereagh Freeway between Pennant Hills Road and Lane Cove River at North Ryde, known as F2 Stage 1.<ref name=rta_may1993>{{cite web|url=https://media.opengov.nsw.gov.au/pairtree_root/88/ad/a3/00/20/25/42/45/aa/c8/9e/0c/8e/43/85/79/obj/168068.pdf|title=North West Transport Link - Environmental Impact Assessment Report|website=OpenGov NSW|publisher=NSW Roads & Traffic Authority|page=11-25|date=May 1993|accessdate=9 April 2020}}</ref> In the proposal, the link to [[Epping Road]] at Marsfield, and the link to Fig Tree Bridge at Hunters Hill were abandoned.<ref name=jul1990>{{cite web|url=https://media.opengov.nsw.gov.au/pairtree_root/e6/58/e4/35/1d/05/48/05/92/dd/9d/10/58/a2/01/c9/obj/169247.pdf|title=A Proposed Expressway from Pennant Hills Road, Beecroft to Pittwater Road, Ryde known as the F2 Stage 1|website=OpenGov NSW|publisher=Commissioners of Inquiry for Environment and Planning|date=July 1990|accessdate=9 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nSubsequently, a Commission of Inquiry on the 1989 proposal was set up and chaired by the commissioner [[John Woodward (lawyer)|John Woodward]]. In July 1990, the commissioner released a report recommending that the freeway should not be built, but instead upgrade the east-west road system between Pennant Hills Road and Epping Road at North Ryde. The report stressed that the findings only applied to the 1989 proposal (i.e. east of Pennant Hills Road) and \"should not be taken in any way to be a judgment on the construction of the roadway west of Pennant Hills Road\".<ref name=rta_may1993/><ref name=jul1990/>\n\nThe commission also mentioned that if an expressway was to be built, North Epping residents had indicated that they would prefer a tunnel under the locality instead of a cut and fill which they deemed excessive. The commission was also in support of a tunnel if the expressway was to be built. The tunnel was incorporated in later design proposals and was eventually built as the Epping/Norfolk Tunnel.<ref name=jul1990/><ref name=linkt_m2/>\n\n===1992 Proposal===\nIn September 1990, the [[Minister for Roads (New South Wales)|Minister of Roads]] [[Wal Murray]] announced a preparation of a new EIS for a transport link for Sydney's North West region, later known as the '''North West Transport Link'''. The transport link was proposed to connect Old Windsor Road, [[Seven Hills, New South Wales|Seven Hills]] to [[Epping Road]], [[North Ryde]], bypassing the Carlingford Road and Epping Road.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://media.opengov.nsw.gov.au/pairtree_root/59/30/cc/58/5e/41/46/10/bd/bc/0e/30/f4/5d/03/73/obj/168091.pdf|title=North West Transport Link Western Section - Civil Engineering Working Paper|publisher=SMEC|website=OpenGov NSW|date=March 1992|accessdate=20 March 2020}}</ref> The proposed link would continue eastwards onto Epping Road, then linked with the Gore Hill Freeway at [[Artarmon]] which led to the [[Sydney Harbour Bridge|Harbour Bridge]] and the [[Sydney central business district]].\n\nEnvironmental impact ssessments were done separately for the section between Old Windsor Road and [[Pennant Hills Road]] (western section) and the section between Pennant Hills Road and Epping Road (eastern section), by [[SMEC Holdings|SMEC]] and Maunsell respectively. However, the two assessments were to be done in cooperation to ensure integration of the proposal.<ref name=rta_may1993/>\n\n====Western Section====\nThere were three shortlisted options for utilising the Castlereagh Freeway reserve between Old Windsor Road and Pennant Hills Road in the western section:<ref name=eis_western>{{cite web|url=https://media.opengov.nsw.gov.au/pairtree_root/71/0b/05/f6/06/f7/4e/4f/9e/f7/16/9a/02/78/24/37/obj/166323.pdf|title=North West Transport Link - Pennant Hills Road to Old Windsor Road - Environmental Impact Statement|website=OpenGov NSW|publisher=NSW Roads & Traffic Authority|page=vi, 103, 129-168|date=1992|accessdate=20 March 2020}}</ref>\n*Alternative 1: Four-lane expressway via the reserve with a busway in the median, continuing to a proposed expressway east of Pennant Hills Road (i.e. eastern section). No toll and two toll options were considered for this alternative.\n*Alternative 2: Four-lane expressway via the reserve, terminating at Pennant Hills Road. Pennant Hills Road, Carlingford Road and Epping Road would be upgraded and continue as the arterial route east of the expressway. The busway would be in the median between Old Windsor Road and Barclays Road, before continuing along Barclays, North Rocks, Pennant Hills and Carlingford Roads. This alternative would not be tolled.\n*Alternative 3: Arterial road via the reserve between Old Windsor Road and Barclays Road, before continuing along Barclays, North Rocks, Pennant Hills and Carlingford Roads. Exclusive bus lanes would be provided on the kerb lanes of the new road.\n\nAlternative 3 was evaluated to have the least environmental impact but have the worst transport efficiency and safety out of the three alternatives. It also received little support from the community.<ref name=eis_western/> As such, alternative 3 was eliminated from further evaluation and detailed assessment, leaving only alternatives 1 and 2. Ultimately, alternative 1 was chosen as the design of the expressway.\n\n====Eastern Section====\n{{section incomplete|date=April 2020}}\nDuring the assessment, the 1989 proposal was not considered.<ref name=rta_may1993/>\n\nOne busway lane in each direction would be located in the centre of the expressway between Pennant Hills Road and Beecroft Road, continuing from the proposed busway in the western section. The busway would leave the expressway and would lead via Beecroft Road to a bus interchange at [[Epping railway station, Sydney|Epping Station]]. It would be constructed to allow for a future conversion to light rail.\n\nGrade-separated interchanges would be built at Delhi Road, [[Lane Cove Road]], Balaclava Road (now Christie Road) and Beecroft Road. The eastern section will connect to the western section at the grade-separated Pennant Hills Road interchange.\n\n===Construction===\nIn May 1993, the government announced that the road would be constructed with private funds using a [[Build-operate-transfer|Build Own Operate Transfer]]. The Government then entered into an agreement with Hills Motorway Limited to build and operate the M2 for 45 years, before ownership will revert to the government. The motorway pioneered the use of electronic tolling in Australia.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}\n\nA two lane busway was built in the median between [[Windsor Road (Sydney)|Windsor Road]] to Beecroft Road with a connection to Epping Train Station. There were dedicated access ramps for buses, which was removed in 2012 during road works to widen the motorway.<ref name=casestudy>{{cite web | url = http://svc012.wic014v.server-web.com/DisplayFile.aspx?FileID=27 | title = INFRASTRUCTURE PARTNERSHIPS AUSTRALIA-CASE STUDIES (Hills M2 Motorway, Sydney)}}</ref>\n\nMahers Road in Carlingford, running east-west along the southern boundary of Pennant Hills Golf Course, was completely removed and replaced by the new expressway. Pennant Hills Road was also realigned near Mahers Road, with the old section of the road now known as Mahers Place.\n\n====Protests====\nThere was strong community opposition to the construction of the motorway by local residents and environment groups including the Nature Conservation Council, as the route would destroy a vast area of valuable urban bushland, the money would be better spent on public transport infrastructure and the air pollution from private motor vehicles would contribute to global warming. There were also fears the bus lanes might be removed in the future to provide additional capacity for private vehicles. \"Freeway Busters\" was one of the groups that organised protests, including two \"Cyclestormings\" of the construction site by hundreds of cyclists. The opening ceremony of the tollway in 1997, a champagne breakfast for conservative dignitaries including Alan Jones and a \"celebrity drive-through\" featuring swimmer Susie Maroney, was disrupted by sound systems mounted high in gum trees, playing the sound of car crashes, ambulance sirens and jack-hammers. After the motorway opened, cyclists also protested the toll which the operators charged cyclists by occupying the toll plaza. This protest was successful and the toll was subsequently dropped.\n\n===Operation===\nThe motorway was opened on 26 May 1997 by Sandra Schaap.<ref name=TreasuryPPP>{{cite web | url = http://www.treasury.nsw.gov.au/ppp/nsw_projects/projects_which_have_been_awarded/roads/M2_Motorway | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140218000952/http://www.treasury.nsw.gov.au/ppp/nsw_projects/projects_which_have_been_awarded/roads/M2_Motorway | url-status = dead | archive-date = 2014-02-18 | title = M2 Motorway PPP }}</ref> It was acquired by [[Transurban]] in 2006 after a successful [[takeover]] bid.

The unused but still reserved corridor continues west and passes north of suburbs including [[Shalvey, New South Wales|Shalvey]] and [[Willmot, New South Wales|Willmot]], continuing west past [[Llandilo, New South Wales|Llandilo]] to stop abruptly near [[Londonderry, New South Wales|Londonderry]] at the foot of the [[Blue Mountains (Australia)|Blue Mountains]].\n\nThe [[Lane Cove Tunnel]], which linked the M2 at [[Lane Cove]], opened on 25 March 2007.\n\nA third traffic lane westbound between the Lane Cove Road and Beecroft Road interchanges which utilises a former cycling/breakdown lane opened in April 2007. This change was criticised by cyclists, who were required to use an alternative route as a result, and by some motorists who have said that the addition of a third lane will [[induced traffic|induce more traffic]] and would only shift the bottleneck further down the motorway as a result of assisting and maintaining free-flowing traffic from the Lane Cove Tunnel.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} A speed camera to enforce the 70&nbsp;km/h limit was introduced on the westbound carriageway just before the Epping/Norfolk Road tunnel.{{when|date=March 2013}}\n\nTolling became fully cashless with no toll booths 30 January 2012<ref>http://www.hillsm2.com.au/cashless.htm</ref><ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.ozroads.com.au/NSW/Freeways/M2/m2.htm | title = M2 Hills Motorway | publisher = Ozroads | accessdate = 30 August 2011}}{{Self-published source|date=October 2013}}</ref> (Transurban had originally proposed that it would cashless from December 2007<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hillsm2.com.au/transurban_online/ne5nav_hills.nsf/LinkView/7701C3D3519B46E2CA2572C80075D69CABD5DAB709F88F70CA25703E0064DA30 |title=not know |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070705000527/http://www.hillsm2.com.au/transurban_online/ne5nav_hills.nsf/LinkView/7701C3D3519B46E2CA2572C80075D69CABD5DAB709F88F70CA25703E0064DA30 |archivedate=5 July 2007 }}</ref>).\n\nA major upgrade started in January 2011, with more on- and off-ramps being built, including off-ramps onto Windsor Road eastbound, which was completed in July 2012,<ref>[http://www.hillsnews.com.au/story/246883/m2-opened-to-the-hills-with-new-access-ramps/ M2 opened to the Hills with the new access ramps], ''Hills News''.
