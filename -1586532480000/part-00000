The first 6 locomotives were ordered in 1956. They entered service between 1959 and 1963. The locomotives were built by 2 manufacturers, Valmet and Lokomo, both based in Tampere. All Hr12 class locomotives with even numbers were produced by Valmet, while all odd numbers were produced by Lokomo. The locomotives were withdrawn in the early 1990s.\n\n==Features ==\n\nWhen it was introduced, the Dr12 gave drivers a new experience of comfort and forward visibility compared to steam locomotives, but compared to the newer [[VR Class Dr13]], the Dr12 had a heavy axle load and slow acceleration with a top speed of only 120&nbsp;km/h. The reason for this was that the locomotive turned out to be underpowered. The problem of the top speed was corrected in the last 10 locomotives by changing the transmission in such a way that the technical top speed was increased to 140&nbsp;km/h, but this feature was never used. As a result, the entire locomotive series had a maximum permissible speed restricted to 120&nbsp;km/h. However, due to the high axle weight, the Dr12 had good adhesion properties and it was considered to be a reliable and robust locomotive. It was well-suited to heavy trains with relatively low speed requirements.\n\nIn addition to the underpowered engine, the second problem of the Dr12 was the heavy axle load, which could damage lightly laid tracks. In practice it could only be used on Western Finland's heavily laid lines.\n\n== Technology ==\nDr12 consisted of two three-axle bogies each of which had one driving motor per axle, on which rested a very rigid steel body with the hardware and the cabins. The locomotive had one large 182-liter 1,800&nbsp;hp V16 diesel engine mounted in its centre, which was directly connected to the main and auxiliary generator sets. Cabins had safety zones in both ends which were designed to protect the driver and equipment in a collision.\n\nTwo locomotives could be connected to be controlled by one set of controls, but this feature was used very rarely.\n\n==Use ==\nDr12 was intended for use on heavy passenger and freight trains. As the timetables got tighter, the acceleration of the Dr12 turned out to be insufficient for passenger trains.\n\nBoth the locomotive numbers 2200 (made by Valmet) and 2201 (made by Lokomo) started their careers in April 1959.\n\nThe locomotives were based at Tampere depot, where they initially pulled express trains and heavy freight trains between Helsinki and Sein\u00e4joki and between Riihim\u00e4ki and Kouvola.\n\nThe electrification of the main lines and the upgrade of the tracks allowed the operating area of the Dr12s to expand to unelectrified lines in the East and North, where they replaced the [[VR Class Hr1]] and [[VR Class Tr1]] locomotives. By 1980 Finland's major railway lines had been electrified, which drastically reduced the need for diesel traction. In the end Dr12 locomotives were used in [[Turku]] and [[Tampere]] areas, including the Turku\u2013Tampere line. The last Dr12 locomotive (no. 2216) was withdrawn after pulling a timber train from [[Salo, Finland]] to Turku on 19 December 1990.

The first 6 locomotives were ordered in 1956. They entered service between 1959 and 1963. The locomotives were built by 2 manufacturers, Valmet and Lokomo, both based in Tampere. All Hr12 class locomotives with even numbers were produced by Valmet, while all odd numbers were produced by Lokomo. The locomotives were withdrawn in the early 1990s.\n\n==Features ==\n\nWhen it was introduced, the Dr12 gave drivers a new experience of comfort and forward visibility compared to steam locomotives, but compared to the newer [[VR Class Dr13]], the Dr12 had a heavy axle load and slow acceleration with a top speed of only 120&nbsp;km/h. The reason for this was that the locomotive turned out to be underpowered. The problem of the top speed was corrected in the last 10 locomotives by changing the transmission in such a way that the technical top speed was increased to 140&nbsp;km/h, but this feature was never used. As a result, the entire locomotive series had a maximum permissible speed restricted to 120&nbsp;km/h. However, due to the high axle weight, the Dr12 had good adhesion properties and it was considered to be a reliable and robust locomotive. It was well-suited to heavy trains with relatively low speed requirements.\n\nIn addition to the underpowered engine, the second problem of the Dr12 was the heavy axle load, which could damage lightly laid tracks. In practice it could only be used on Western Finland\u2019s heavily laid lines.\n\n== Technology ==\nDr12 consisted of two three-axle bogies each of which had one driving motor per axle, on which rested a very rigid steel body with the hardware and the cabins. The locomotive had one large 182-liter 1,800&nbsp;hp V16 diesel engine mounted in its centre, which was directly connected to the main and auxiliary generator sets. Cabins had safety zones in both ends which were designed to protect the driver and equipment in a collision.\n\nTwo locomotives could be connected to be controlled by one set of controls, but this feature was used very rarely.\n\n==Use ==\nDr12 was intended for use on heavy passenger and freight trains. As the timetables got tighter, the acceleration of the Dr12 turned out to be insufficient for passenger trains.\n\nBoth the locomotive numbers 2200 (made by Valmet) and 2201 (made by Lokomo) started their careers in April 1959.\n\nThe locomotives were based at Tampere depot, where they initially pulled express trains and heavy freight trains between Helsinki and Sein\u00e4joki and between Riihim\u00e4ki and Kouvola.\n\nThe electrification of the main lines and the upgrade of the tracks allowed the operating area of the Dr12s to expand to unelectrified lines in the East and North, where they replaced the [[VR Class Hr1]] and [[VR Class Tr1]] locomotives. By 1980 Finland\u2019s major railway lines had been electrified, which drastically reduced the need for diesel traction. In the end Dr12 locomotives were used in [[Turku]] and [[Tampere]] areas, including the Turku\u2013Tampere line. The last Dr12 locomotive (no. 2216) was withdrawn after pulling a timber train from [[Salo, Finland]] to Turku on 19 December 1990. This same locomotive is now preserved and it was used at the VR Group's 150th anniversary in August 2012 on the [[Hanko]]\u2013[[Hyvink\u00e4\u00e4]] line.\n\n== Numbering ==\n\n* Years of manufacture (Nos.):\n** 1959 (2200\u20132205)\n** 1960 (2206\u20132219)\n** 1961 (2220\u20132227)\n** 1962 (2228\u20132231)\n** 1963 (2232\u20132241)\n\n==Gallery==\n{{gallery\n|File:Dr12 ohjausp\u00f6yt\u00e4.JPG| Dr12's Cab controls\n|File: Dr12 Lohja.jpg|  Dr12 diesel locomotive no. 2216 with a heritage train at [[Lohja]] railway station\n}}\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Finnish Railway Museum]]\n* [[Heritage railways]]\n* [[History of rail transport in Finland]]\n* [[Jokioinen Museum Railway]]\n* [[List of Finnish locomotives]]\n* [[List of heritage railways]]\n* [[List of railway museums]] Worldwide\n* [[Restored trains]]\n* [[VR Group]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{commonscat-inline|VR Class Dr12}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20110716115318/http://www.rautatie.org/web/en/default.asp Finnish Railway Museum]\n*[http://www.internationalsteam.co.uk/trains/finland01.htm Steam Locomotives in Finland Including the Finnish Railway Museum]\n\n{{Finnish locomotives}}\n\n[[Category:Valmet|Dr12]]\n[[Category:VR locomotives|Dr12]]\n[[Category:Diesel-electric locomotives of Finland|Dr12]]\n[[Category:Railway locomotives introduced in 1955]]\n[[Category:5 ft gauge locomotives]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: \u2019s \u2192 's (2)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VR_Class_Dr12"}

The game is the first entry in the ''[[Armored Core]]'' series. A digital port was released in 2007 in Japan and 2015 in North America on the [[PlayStation Network]] as a part of the [[PSone Classics]] line of games.\n\nThe story introduces many elements that are commonly found in later game in the series, such as [[Corporatocracy|corporatocracies]] and [[mecha|mech]] robots known as \"Armored Cores.\" The game takes place in a future [[Earth]] that has been wiped out by a cataclysm and forced humanity underground, a theme which would continue until [[Armored Core 4|''Armored Core 4'']].\n\nGameplay involves controlling Armored Cores in combat scenarios against other Cores and vehicles. Cores are highly modular, allowing players a great deal of customization over them, such as swapping out different leg units to gain speed advantages.
