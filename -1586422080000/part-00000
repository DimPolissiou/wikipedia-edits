She co-wrote the song with [[Diane Warren]] for the 2015 documentary film ''[[The Hunting Ground]]'', which deals with [[campus rape]] in the United States. The song had leaked onto the Internet through an unofficial recording made at the film's premiere at the [[2015 Sundance Film Festival]]. It was later released by [[Interscope Records]] to [[Music download|digital retailers]] on September 18, 2015. The director and producer of the film had looked for someone influential to write a song for it, and music supervisor Bonnie Greenberg contacted Warren, who was interested. She wrote the song with Gaga and producer [[Nile Rodgers]] accompanied them during the recording, providing his suggestions.\n\nA universal song about any kind of loss in life, \"Til It Happens to You\" was placed during two sequences in the film, highlighting the pain of [[sexual assault]]. The song consists of an orchestral production with strings, and an emotional vocal delivery from Gaga. Lyrically it asks listeners to stand in a victim's position and try to understand the turmoil they go through. \"Til It Happens to You\" was later included as part of a [[public service announcement]] video directed by [[Catherine Hardwicke]]. The video depicts various instances of [[violence against women]] and sexual assaults. It ends with a cautionary note about the effects of such distress, and individuals finding solace with their close friends and relatives.\n\nA portion of the proceeds from retail sales was donated to organizations supporting victims of sexual assault. Commercially, the song reached the top thirty in Finland, Greece, and Spain, and it peaked at number 95 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] in the United States in March 2016. \"Til It Happens to You\" won an award at the [[68th Primetime Emmy Awards]] for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Original Music and Lyrics|Outstanding Original Music and Lyrics]] and it was nominated for [[Grammy Award for Best Song Written for Visual Media|Best Song Written for Visual Media]] at the [[58th Annual Grammy Awards]] and for [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]] at the [[88th Academy Awards]], along with numerous other awards.\n\n==Background and release==\n[[File:Diane Warren 03A.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Diane Warren]] co-wrote \"Til It Happens to You\" with [[Lady Gaga]].|alt=Diane Warren holding a mic.]]\n\n\"Til It Happens to You\" was written by Diane Warren and Lady Gaga, and recorded by the latter for ''[[The Hunting Ground]]'' (2015), a documentary film about campus rape in the United States.<ref name=Billboard>{{cite journal|last=Gallo|first=Phil|title=Diane Warren on Her Lady Gaga Collaboration for New Documentary 'The Hunting Ground'|journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=January 27, 2015|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6451064/diane-warren-lady-gaga-song-till-it-happens-to-you-hunting-ground|accessdate=May 4, 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150428095535/http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6451064/diane-warren-lady-gaga-song-till-it-happens-to-you-hunting-ground|archivedate=April 28, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Director [[Kirby Dick]] and producer [[Amy Ziering]] wanted someone with \"major\" influence to record a song for the film, believing it would generate publicity and promote the subject.

Blavin started searching and met with music supervisor Bonnie Greenberg, who introduced him to Warren.<ref name=\"mtvdev\"/> Warren was moved by the idea saying: \"I cannot not <!-- THIS IS NOT AN ERROR.

It was later released by [[Interscope Records]] to [[Music download|digital retailers]] on September 18, 2015. The director and producer of the film had looked for someone influential to write a song for it, and music supervisor Bonnie Greenberg contacted Warren, who was interested. She wrote the song with Gaga and producer [[Nile Rodgers]] accompanied them during the recording, providing his suggestions.\n\nA universal song about any kind of loss in life, \"Til It Happens to You\" was placed during two sequences in the film, highlighting the pain of [[sexual assault]]. The song consists of an orchestral production with strings, and an emotional vocal delivery from Gaga. Lyrically it asks listeners to stand in a victim's position and try to understand the turmoil they go through. \"Til It Happens to You\" was later included as part of a [[public service announcement]] video directed by [[Catherine Hardwicke]]. The video depicts various instances of [[violence against women]] and sexual assaults. It ends with a cautionary note about the effects of such distress, and individuals finding solace with their close friends and relatives.\n\nA portion of the proceeds from retail sales was donated to organizations supporting victims of sexual assault. Commercially, the song reached the top thirty in Finland, Greece, and Spain, and it peaked at number 95 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] in the United States in March 2016. \"Til It Happens to You\" won an award at the [[68th Primetime Emmy Awards]] for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Original Music and Lyrics|Outstanding Original Music and Lyrics]] and it was nominated for [[Grammy Award for Best Song Written for Visual Media|Best Song Written for Visual Media]] at the [[58th Annual Grammy Awards]] and for [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]] at the [[88th Academy Awards]], along with numerous other awards.\n\n==Background and release==\n[[File:Diane Warren 03A.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Diane Warren]] co-wrote \"Til It Happens to You\" with [[Lady Gaga]].|alt=Diane Warren holding a mic.]]\n\n\"Til It Happens to You\" was written by Diane Warren and Lady Gaga, and recorded by the latter for ''[[The Hunting Ground]]'' (2015), a documentary film about campus rape in the United States.<ref name=Billboard>{{cite journal|last=Gallo|first=Phil|title=Diane Warren on Her Lady Gaga Collaboration for New Documentary 'The Hunting Ground'|journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=January 27, 2015|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6451064/diane-warren-lady-gaga-song-till-it-happens-to-you-hunting-ground|accessdate=May 4, 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150428095535/http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6451064/diane-warren-lady-gaga-song-till-it-happens-to-you-hunting-ground|archivedate=April 28, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Director [[Kirby Dick]] and producer [[Amy Ziering]] wanted someone with \"major\" influence to record a song for the film, believing it would generate publicity and promote the subject.

Two years after the publication of ''Cover Her Face'', James's husband died, and she took a position as a civil servant within the criminal section of the [[Home Office]]. She worked in government service until her retirement in 1979.\n\nIn 1991, James was created a [[life peer]] as Baroness James of Holland Park.  She sat in the [[House of Lords]] as a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]]. She was an [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] and a lay patron of the [[Prayer Book Society (England)|Prayer Book Society]].

''Talking About Detective Fiction'' was published in 2009. Over her writing career, James also wrote many essays and short stories for [[Periodical literature|periodicals]] and [[Anthology|anthologies]], which have yet to be collected.

Two years after the publication of ''Cover Her Face'', James's husband died, and she took a position as a civil servant within the criminal section of the [[Home Office]]. She worked in government service until her retirement in 1979.\n\nIn 1991, James was created a [[life peer]] as Baroness James of Holland Park.  She sat in the [[House of Lords]] as a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]]. She was an [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] and a lay patron of the [[Prayer Book Society (England)|Prayer Book Society]]. Her 2001 work, ''[[Death in Holy Orders]]'', displays her familiarity with the inner workings of church hierarchy.<ref>\"Why I am still an Anglican\", Continuum, 2006, p. 16.</ref> Her later novels were often set in a community closed in some way, such as a publishing house or barristers' chambers, a theological college, an island or a private clinic. ''Talking About Detective Fiction'' was published in 2009. Over her writing career, James also wrote many essays and short stories for [[Periodical literature|periodicals]] and [[Anthology|anthologies]], which have yet to be collected. She revealed in 2011 that ''The Private Patient'' was the final Dalgliesh novel.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2011/nov/04/pd-james-life-in-writing|title=A life in writing: PD James|author=Sarah Crown|work=the Guardian}}</ref>\n\nAs guest editor of [[BBC Radio 4]]'s ''[[Today (BBC Radio 4)|Today]]'' programme in December 2009, James conducted an interview with the Director General of the BBC, [[Mark Thompson (television executive)|Mark Thompson]], in which she seemed critical of some of his decisions.

Members of this subfamily are called '''murines'''. This subfamily is larger than all [[mammal]] families except the [[Cricetidae]] and [[Muridae]], and is larger than all [[mammal]] [[order (biology)|order]]s except the [[bat]]s and the remainder of the [[rodent]]s.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Mammal Species of the World: A Taxonomic and Geographic Reference, Volume 12|year = 2005|isbn = 9780801882210|location = |pages = 1191|url = https://books.google.com/?id=YnYED-YG0ZYC&pg=PA1191&lpg=PA1191&dq=mures+old-world#v=onepage&q=Mures&f=false|last1 = Wilson|first1 = Don E.|last2 = Reeder|first2 = Deeann M.}}</ref>\n\n==Description==\nThe Murinae are native to [[Africa]], [[Europe]], [[Asia]], and [[Australia]].  They are the only [[terrestrial animal|terrestrial]] [[placental]] [[mammal]]s native to Australia.  They have also been [[invasive species|introduced]] to all continents except [[Antarctica]], and are serious pest animals.  This is particularly true in island communities where they have contributed to the [[endangered|endangerment]] and [[extinct]]ion of many native animals.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nTwo prominent murine human [[commensalism|commensal]]s have become vital [[laboratory animal]]s.  The [[brown rat]] and [[house mouse]] are both used as medical subjects.\n\nThe murines have a distinctive [[Molar (tooth)|molar]] pattern that involves three rows of cusps instead of two, the primitive pattern seen most frequently in [[muroid rodent]]s.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\n==Fossils==\nThe first known appearance of the Murinae in the [[fossil]] record is about [[Miocene|14 million years ago]] with the fossil genus ''[[Antemus]]''. ''Antemus'' is thought to derive directly from ''[[Potwarmus]]'', which has a more primitive tooth pattern.  Likewise, two genera, ''[[Progonomys]]'' and ''[[Karnimata]]'', are thought to derive directly from ''Antemus''.  ''Progonomys'' is thought to be the ancestor of ''[[Mus (genus)|Mus]]'' and relatives, while ''Karnimata'' is thought to lead to ''[[Rattus]]'' and relatives.  All of these fossils are found in the well-preserved and easily dated [[Siwalik]] fossil beds of [[Pakistan]]. The transition from ''Potwarmus'' to ''Antemus'' to ''Progonomys'' and ''Karnimata'' is considered an excellent example of [[anagenesis|anagenic evolution]].{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\n==Taxonomy==\nMost of the Murinae have been poorly studied.  Some genera have been grouped, such as the hydromyine water rats, conilurine or pseudomyine Australian mice, or the phloeomyine [[Southeast Asia]]n forms.  No [[tribe (biology)|tribal]] level [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] has been attempted for the complete subfamily.  It appears as if genera from Southeast Asian islands and Australia may be early offshoots compared to mainland forms.  The [[vlei rat]]s in the genera ''[[Otomys]]'' and ''[[Parotomys]]'' are often placed in a separate subfamily, Otomyinae, but have been shown to be closely related to African murines in spite of their uniqueness.\n\nThree genera, ''[[Uranomys]]'', ''[[Lophuromys]]'', and ''[[Acomys]]'', were once considered to be murines, but were found to be more closely related to [[gerbil]]s through [[molecular phylogeny|molecular phylogenetics]].  They have been assigned a new subfamily status, [[Deomyinae]].\n\nMolecular phylogenetic studies of Murinae include Lecompte, et al. (2008),<ref>Emilie Lecompte, Ken Aplin, Christiane Denys, Fran\u00e7ois Catzeflis, Marion Chades and Pascale Chevret. 2008. Phylogeny and biogeography of African Murinae based on mitochondrial and nuclear gene sequences, with a new tribal classification of the subfamily. BMC Evolutionary Biology2008 8:199 DOI: 10.1186/1471-2148-8-199</ref> which analyzes African murine species based on the mitochondrial [[cytochrome b]] gene and two nuclear gene fragments. Lecompte, et al. (2008) estimates that African murines colonized Africa from Asia approximately 11 million years ago during the [[Miocene]].\n\nThe following [[phylogeny]] of 16 Murinae [[genus|genera]], based on [[molecular phylogenetic]] analysis of the [[RBP3|Interphotoreceptor Retinoid Binding Protein]] (IRBP) gene, is from Jansa & Weksler (2004: 264).<ref name=\"JansaWeksler2004\">{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.ympev.2003.07.002 | last1 = Jansa | first1 = S.A. | last2 = Weksler | first2 = M. | title = Phylogeny of muroid rodents: relationships within and among major lineages as determined by IRBP gene sequences | journal = Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution | volume = 31 | issue = 1 | pages = 256\u2013276 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15019624| ref = harv}}</ref>\n{{clade| style=font-size:95%;line-height:90%\n|label1='''Murinae'''&nbsp;\n|1={{clade\n|1=''[[Phloeomys]]''\n|2={{clade\n|1={{clade\n|1=''[[Micromys]]''\n|2={{clade\n|1=''[[Maxomys]]''\n|2={{clade\n|1=''[[Niviventer]]''\n|2={{clade\n|1=''[[Sundamys]]''\n|2=''[[Rattus]]''\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n|2={{clade\n|1=''[[Rhynchomys]]''\n|2={{clade\n|1=''[[Otomys]]''\n|2={{clade\n|1=''[[Aethomys]]''\n|2={{clade\n|1=''[[Rhabdomys]]''\n|2=''[[Grammomys]]''\n}}\n}}\n}}\n|3={{clade\n|1=''[[Tokudaia]]''\n|2={{clade\n|1=''[[Mus (genus)|Mus]]''\n|2={{clade\n|1=''[[Mastomys]]''\n|2={{clade\n|1=''[[Praomys]]''\n|2=''[[Hylomyscus]]''\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n\n==Distribution==\nThe following is a list of Murinae genus divisions ordered by the continents that they are endemic to.

the art glass technique}}\n\nThe '''Old World rats and mice''', part of the [[subfamily]] '''Murinae''' in the [[Family (biology)|family]] [[Muridae]], comprise at least 519 species. Members of this subfamily are called '''murines'''. This subfamily is larger than all [[mammal]] families except the [[Cricetidae]] and [[Muridae]], and is larger than all [[mammal]] [[order (biology)|order]]s except the [[bat]]s and the remainder of the [[rodent]]s.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Mammal Species of the World: A Taxonomic and Geographic Reference, Volume 12|year = 2005|isbn = 9780801882210|location = |pages = 1191|url = https://books.google.com/?id=YnYED-YG0ZYC&pg=PA1191&lpg=PA1191&dq=mures+old-world#v=onepage&q=Mures&f=false|last1 = Wilson|first1 = Don E.|last2 = Reeder|first2 = Deeann M.}}</ref>\n\n==Description==\nThe Murinae are native to [[Africa]], [[Europe]], [[Asia]], and [[Australia]].  They are the only [[terrestrial animal|terrestrial]] [[placental]] [[mammal]]s native to Australia.  They have also been [[invasive species|introduced]] to all continents except [[Antarctica]], and are serious pest animals.  This is particularly true in island communities where they have contributed to the [[endangered|endangerment]] and [[extinct]]ion of many native animals.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nTwo prominent murine human [[commensalism|commensal]]s have become vital [[laboratory animal]]s.  The [[brown rat]] and [[house mouse]] are both used as medical subjects.\n\nThe murines have a distinctive [[Molar (tooth)|molar]] pattern that involves three rows of cusps instead of two, the primitive pattern seen most frequently in [[muroid rodent]]s.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\n==Fossils==\nThe first known appearance of the Murinae in the [[fossil]] record is about [[Miocene|14 million years ago]] with the fossil genus ''[[Antemus]]''. ''Antemus'' is thought to derive directly from ''[[Potwarmus]]'', which has a more primitive tooth pattern.  Likewise, two genera, ''[[Progonomys]]'' and ''[[Karnimata]]'', are thought to derive directly from ''Antemus''.  ''Progonomys'' is thought to be the ancestor of ''[[Mus (genus)|Mus]]'' and relatives, while ''Karnimata'' is thought to lead to ''[[Rattus]]'' and relatives.  All of these fossils are found in the well-preserved and easily dated [[Siwalik]] fossil beds of [[Pakistan]]. The transition from ''Potwarmus'' to ''Antemus'' to ''Progonomys'' and ''Karnimata'' is considered an excellent example of [[anagenesis|anagenic evolution]].{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\n==Taxonomy==\nMost of the Murinae have been poorly studied.  Some genera have been grouped, such as the hydromyine water rats, conilurine or pseudomyine Australian mice, or the phloeomyine [[Southeast Asia]]n forms.  No [[tribe (biology)|tribal]] level [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] has been attempted for the complete subfamily.  It appears as if genera from Southeast Asian islands and Australia may be early offshoots compared to mainland forms.  The [[vlei rat]]s in the genera ''[[Otomys]]'' and ''[[Parotomys]]'' are often placed in a separate subfamily, Otomyinae, but have been shown to be closely related to African murines in spite of their uniqueness.\n\nThree genera, ''[[Uranomys]]'', ''[[Lophuromys]]'', and ''[[Acomys]]'', were once considered to be murines, but were found to be more closely related to [[gerbil]]s through [[molecular phylogeny|molecular phylogenetics]].  They have been assigned a new subfamily status, [[Deomyinae]].\n\nMolecular phylogenetic studies of Murinae include Lecompte, et al. (2008),<ref>Emilie Lecompte, Ken Aplin, Christiane Denys, Fran\u00e7ois Catzeflis, Marion Chades and Pascale Chevret. 2008. Phylogeny and biogeography of African Murinae based on mitochondrial and nuclear gene sequences, with a new tribal classification of the subfamily. BMC Evolutionary Biology2008 8:199 DOI: 10.1186/1471-2148-8-199</ref> which analyzes African murine species based on the mitochondrial [[cytochrome b]] gene and two nuclear gene fragments. Lecompte, et al. (2008) estimates that African murines colonized Africa from Asia approximately 11 million years ago during the [[Miocene]].\n\nThe following [[phylogeny]] of 16 Murinae [[genus|genera]], based on [[molecular phylogenetic]] analysis of the [[RBP3|Interphotoreceptor Retinoid Binding Protein]] (IRBP) gene, is from Jansa & Weksler (2004: 264).<ref name=\"JansaWeksler2004\">{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.ympev.2003.07.002 | last1 = Jansa | first1 = S.A. | last2 = Weksler | first2 = M. | title = Phylogeny of muroid rodents: relationships within and among major lineages as determined by IRBP gene sequences | journal = Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution | volume = 31 | issue = 1 | pages = 256\u2013276 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15019624| ref = harv}}</ref>\n{{clade| style=font-size:95%;line-height:90%\n|label1='''Murinae'''&nbsp;\n|1={{clade\n|1=''[[Phloeomys]]''\n|2={{clade\n|1={{clade\n|1=''[[Micromys]]''\n|2={{clade\n|1=''[[Maxomys]]''\n|2={{clade\n|1=''[[Niviventer]]''\n|2={{clade\n|1=''[[Sundamys]]''\n|2=''[[Rattus]]''\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n|2={{clade\n|1=''[[Rhynchomys]]''\n|2={{clade\n|1=''[[Otomys]]''\n|2={{clade\n|1=''[[Aethomys]]''\n|2={{clade\n|1=''[[Rhabdomys]]''\n|2=''[[Grammomys]]''\n}}\n}}\n}}\n|3={{clade\n|1=''[[Tokudaia]]''\n|2={{clade\n|1=''[[Mus (genus)|Mus]]''\n|2={{clade\n|1=''[[Mastomys]]''\n|2={{clade\n|1=''[[Praomys]]''\n|2=''[[Hylomyscus]]''\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n\n==Distribution==\nThe following is a list of Murinae genus divisions ordered by the continents that they are endemic to.

It was released on November 27, 1992 by [[JMJ Records]], [[Rush Associated Labels]] and [[Chaos Recordings]]. The song signifies the Jamaican tradition of a gun salute as a show of respect to the men on the mic.\n\nProduced by [[Chyskillz|Chylow Parker]], \"Throw Ya Gunz\" was a success and made it to four ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' charts, including #1 on the [[Rap Songs|Hot Rap Singles]] for two weeks. The song achieved even greater success in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], where it peaked at #34 on the [[UK Top 40]] in 1993.\n\nThe song was used as a promo for the [[South Park (season 18)|18th season]] of the American [[animated sitcom]] [[South Park]]. The song was sampled by more than 50 rap artists including [[Jeru The Damaja]], [[The Notorious B.I.G.]], [[Eminem]], [[Vinnie Paz]] and [[A$AP Mob]]. \"Throw Ya Gunz\" is featured in a 1993 [[Forest Whitaker]]'s award-winning [[HBO]] drama ''[[Strapped]]'' and in a 2003 video game ''[[Def Jam Vendetta]]''.\n\n==Original version==\nThe original version was not available on any of Onyx's studio albums. It was recorded featuring a little-known New York's rapper Tek-9 and was called \"Wake Up Dead, Nigga\". Tek-9 had the opening verse and some hook on Jamaican on the second demo version.\n\nThe song was recorded in the studio of [[NYC]]'s legendary [[Apollo Theater]] in Harlem, as well as seven other songs from ''[[Bacdafucup]]''.\n\n==Lyrical content and message==\nThe song signifies the Jamaican tradition of a gun salute as a show of respect to the men on the mic. [[Def Jam]]/[[Rush Associated Labels|RAL]] director of A&R Traci Waples says, \"The phrase isn't about violence; it's a way to salute hip-hop\". (from ''[[Billboard magazine]]'' - May 15, 1993)\n\nIn 1995, in an interview on [[BET]]'s ''[[Teen Summit]]'' Sticky Fingaz explains the meaning of this song: ''\"Throw Ya Gunz\" is a salute to hip hop. Just like in the army. Because this is war out there. So we are army. We got a 21-gun salute to all the people who is dead. It's not about pro-violence. I'm not saying throw your guns and shoot the next brother, i'm saying throw your guns in the air. They think a gun is a violent instrument, which is not. Guns don't kill people! People kill people!''\n\nDespite the fact that the song is dark, the music is jazz-based. The foundation of the song is the oft-used Bob James, not to mention the frequent horn stabs. But the album would turn that jazz sound on its head.<ref>{{cite web| url= https://medium.com/@sdq0218/sampling-the-technology-sounds-part-2-9f90bceb4cc2|title=Sampling: The Technology & Sounds (part 2)| website=medium.com |access-date=2018-09-20}}</ref>\n\n==Radio==\nIn November 1992, the single was delivered to radio, and although it was getting played, program directors \"were complaining\" about the profanity and violence in the lyrics. Julie Greenwald, [[Lyor Cohen]]'s assistant, remembers that time:<ref>{{cite web| url= https://play.google.com/books/reader?id=sd17UkOacxgC&hl=en&printsec=frontcover&pg=GBS.PA212.w.1.2.31|title=Def Jam, Inc., Russell Simmons, Rick Rubin, and the Extraordinary Story of the World's Most Inf (by Stacy Gueraseva) - page 227| website=play.google.com |access-date=2018-09-19}}</ref> <blockquote>\"...Nobody wanted to play [the video], but the places it did get played, it was so reactive, and so potent. We circumvented it with the vinyl out on the streets and with the video at the local video outlets, and we got such major response off that, and we knew that we were developing something so cool.\"</blockquote>\n\nHip hop editor Dart Adams wrote an article about Onyx, where he remembered the first appearance of a song in radio rotation: ''\"Throw Ya Gunz\" spread like wildfire on the airwaves, starting on college Rap shows then to mixshows and regular rotation on the major radio stations. The video went from being played just on \"Rap City\" to playing on almost all of the BET video shows except for \"Video Soul\". As the song got more popular, a backlash occurred coinciding with when it finally was released commercially in late November 1992. Due to pressure from parents groups and others still reeling from the recent Warner Bros./Cop Killer Controversy & the L.A. Riots that happened the previous Spring, BET opted to blur out the guns in \"Throw Ya Gunz\"''.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://bastardswordsman.tumblr.com/post/46732443860/onyx-the-mad-face-invasion-the-20th-anniversary|title=Onyx & The Mad Face Invasion: The 20th Anniversary Of \"Bacdafucup\"| website=bastardswordsman.tumblr.com |access-date=2018-09-19}}</ref>\n\n[[Funkmaster Flex]] was one of the first djs who played \"Throw Ya Gunz\" on his show ''Friday Night Street Jam'' on the radio [[Hot 97]].

At the end of the night it was freezing so we all just started slamming. It turned into one big slam - the adrenaline built up, the warmth built up and the love built up. And that\u2019s why the next song we brought out was \"Slam\".</blockquote>\n\nThe video can be found on the 2008's DVD ''Onyx: 15 Years Of Videos, History And Violence'' and on the 2009's [[Def Jam]]'s DVD ''Def Jam 25: VJ Bring That Video Back''.\n\n==Appearances==\nOn April 25, 1994 Onyx was nominated for five awards on [[The Source]]'s \"1st annual Source Awards\" at the [[Paramount Theatre at Madison Square Garden]], but the group walked out of the building without nothing. Therefore, during performing the song \"Throw Ya Gunz\", Sticky Fingaz shot it up literally on stage. After this show security guards rushed him, looking for a gun, that they would never find. Incident was captured on the amateur camera. It was non-televised, but \"[[Yo! MTV Raps]]\" and \"Video Explosion\" was there and showed some excerpts on TV.\n\nOnyx performed the song live on the UK TV-show \"[[The Word (TV series)|The Word]]\" aired on November 19, 1993.\n\n\"Throw Ya Gunz\" was performed live on the ''Def Jam Recordings 30th Anniversary Concert'' at Brooklyn's [[Barclays Center]] on October 16, 2014.\n\nThe song was performed live on the concert ''Yo!

I knew it would be big, a hip-hop anthem, because that's what we made it for. We planned it out. It was for the streets, it was energetic, and it was grimy. That single went gold, so Def Jam was very happy about that.\"</blockquote>\n\nIn 1993, in an interview for [[NBC News]] about [[gangsta rap]], [[Russell Simmons]] quotes the Sticky Fingaz's lines from \"Throw Ya Gunz\": ''The fact that there's a lot of gangster records right now, there's a lot of voices from people who had no voice before. Sticky Fingaz said 'I hate your guts and I hope you die, my name is Sticky Fingaz my life is a lie'. I want you to feel it in your chest, i want you understand he is a third generation forty projects, he's dead man. Maybe if they do jobs there, they wouldn't be an angry, but in the meantime he might rob you, that's a reality that white Americans has to live with, that's a reality that kids and boys just beginning to understand.''\n\nIn 2010, [[Fat Joe]] share the story about how he first heard the Onyx's song \"Throw Ya Gunz\" in Club 2000 in [[Harlem]], [[NYC]], saying \"it was one of the most classic hip-hop events I've ever been to\".<ref>{{cite web| url= http://rapdirt.com/fat-joe-on-how-onyx-brought-peace-to-harlem/19840|title=Fat Joe On How Onyx Brought Peace To Harlem| website=rapdirt.com |access-date=2018-09-19}}</ref>\n\nThe song was used as a promo for the 18th season of the American [[animated sitcom]] [[South Park]].

It was released on November 27, 1992 by [[JMJ Records]], [[Rush Associated Labels]] and [[Chaos Recordings]]. The song signifies the Jamaican tradition of a gun salute as a show of respect to the men on the mic.\n\nProduced by [[Chyskillz|Chylow Parker]], \"Throw Ya Gunz\" was a success and made it to four ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' charts, including #1 on the [[Rap Songs|Hot Rap Singles]] for two weeks. The song achieved even greater success in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], where it peaked at #34 on the [[UK Top 40]] in 1993.\n\nThe song was used as a promo for the [[South Park (season 18)|18th season]] of the American [[animated sitcom]] [[South Park]]. The song was sampled by more than 50 rap artists including [[Jeru The Damaja]], [[The Notorious B.I.G.]], [[Eminem]], [[Vinnie Paz]] and [[A$AP Mob]]. \"Throw Ya Gunz\" is featured in a 1993 [[Forest Whitaker]]'s award-winning [[HBO]] drama ''[[Strapped]]'' and in a 2003 video game ''[[Def Jam Vendetta]]''.\n\n==Original version==\nThe original version was not available on any of Onyx's studio albums. It was recorded featuring a little-known New York's rapper Tek-9 and was called \"Wake Up Dead, Nigga\". Tek-9 had the opening verse and some hook on Jamaican on the second demo version.\n\nThe song was recorded in the studio of [[NYC]]'s legendary [[Apollo Theater]] in Harlem, as well as seven other songs from ''[[Bacdafucup]]''.\n\n==Lyrical content and message==\nThe song signifies the Jamaican tradition of a gun salute as a show of respect to the men on the mic. [[Def Jam]]/[[Rush Associated Labels|RAL]] director of A&R Traci Waples says, \"The phrase isn't about violence; it's a way to salute hip-hop\". (from ''[[Billboard magazine]]'' - May 15, 1993)\n\nIn 1995, in an interview on [[BET]]'s ''[[Teen Summit]]'' Sticky Fingaz explains the meaning of this song: ''\"Throw Ya Gunz\" is a salute to hip hop. Just like in the army. Because this is war out there. So we are army. We got a 21-gun salute to all the people who is dead. It's not about pro-violence. I'm not saying throw your guns and shoot the next brother, i'm saying throw your guns in the air. They think a gun is a violent instrument, which is not. Guns don't kill people! People kill people!''\n\nDespite the fact that the song is dark, the music is jazz-based. The foundation of the song is the oft-used Bob James, not to mention the frequent horn stabs. But the album would turn that jazz sound on its head.<ref>{{cite web| url= https://medium.com/@sdq0218/sampling-the-technology-sounds-part-2-9f90bceb4cc2|title=Sampling: The Technology & Sounds (part 2)| website=medium.com |access-date=2018-09-20}}</ref>\n\n==Radio==\nIn November of 1992, the single was delivered to radio, and although it was getting played, program directors \"were complaining\" about the profanity and violence in the lyrics. Julie Greenwald, [[Lyor Cohen]]'s assistant, remembers that time:<ref>{{cite web| url= https://play.google.com/books/reader?id=sd17UkOacxgC&hl=en&printsec=frontcover&pg=GBS.PA212.w.1.2.31|title=Def Jam, Inc., Russell Simmons, Rick Rubin, and the Extraordinary Story of the World's Most Inf (by Stacy Gueraseva) - page 227| website=play.google.com |access-date=2018-09-19}}</ref> <blockquote>\"...Nobody wanted to play [the video], but the places it did get played, it was so reactive, and so potent. We circumvented it with the vinyl out on the streets and with the video at the local video outlets, and we got such major response off that, and we knew that we were developing something so cool.\"</blockquote>\n\nHip hop editor Dart Adams wrote an article about Onyx, where he remembered the first appearance of a song in radio rotation: ''\"Throw Ya Gunz\" spread like wildfire on the airwaves, starting on college Rap shows then to mixshows and regular rotation on the major radio stations. The video went from being played just on \"Rap City\" to playing on almost all of the BET video shows except for \"Video Soul\". As the song got more popular, a backlash occurred coinciding with when it finally was released commercially in late November 1992. Due to pressure from parents groups and others still reeling from the recent Warner Bros./Cop Killer Controversy & the L.A. Riots that happened the previous Spring, BET opted to blur out the guns in \"Throw Ya Gunz\"''.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://bastardswordsman.tumblr.com/post/46732443860/onyx-the-mad-face-invasion-the-20th-anniversary|title=Onyx & The Mad Face Invasion: The 20th Anniversary Of \u201cBacdafucup\u201d| website=bastardswordsman.tumblr.com |access-date=2018-09-19}}</ref> \n\n[[Funkmaster Flex]] was one of the first djs who played \"Throw Ya Gunz\" on his show ''Friday Night Street Jam'' on the radio [[Hot 97]].

At the end of the night it was freezing so we all just started slamming. It turned into one big slam - the adrenaline built up, the warmth built up and the love built up. And that\u2019s why the next song we brought out was \"Slam\".</blockquote>\n\nThe video can be found on the 2008's DVD ''Onyx: 15 Years Of Videos, History And Violence'' and on the 2009's [[Def Jam]]'s DVD ''Def Jam 25: VJ Bring That Video Back''.\n\n==Appearances==\nOn April 25, 1994 Onyx was nominated for five awards on [[The Source]]'s \"1st annual Source Awards\" at the [[Paramount Theatre at Madison Square Garden]], but the group walked out of the building without nothing. Therefore, during performing the song \"Throw Ya Gunz\", Sticky Fingaz shot it up literally on stage. After this show security guards rushed him, looking for a gun, that they would never find. Incident was captured on the amateur camera. It was non-televised, but \"[[Yo! MTV Raps]]\" and \"Video Explosion\" was there and showed some excerpts on TV.\n\nOnyx performed the song live on the UK TV-show \"[[The Word (TV series)|The Word]]\" aired on November 19, 1993.\n\n\"Throw Ya Gunz\" was performed live on the ''Def Jam Recordings 30th Anniversary Concert'' at Brooklyn's [[Barclays Center]] on October 16, 2014.\n\nThe song was performed live on the concert ''Yo! MTV Raps: 30th Anniversary Experience'' at Brooklyn's Barclays Center on June 1, 2018.\n\n==Legacy==\nFredro Starr knew that the song will be successful:<ref>{{cite web| url= https://play.google.com/books/reader?id=QuOBbFeg0JIC&hl=en&printsec=frontcover&pg=GBS.PA297.w.4.0.118|title=Check the Technique: Liner Notes for Hip-Hop Junkies (by Brian Coleman) - page 310| website=books.google.ru |access-date=2018-09-19}}</ref><blockquote>\"...With that beat on \"Throw Ya Gunz\", I knew it was going to be a serious record. I knew it would be big, a hip-hop anthem, because that's what we made it for. We planned it out. It was for the streets, it was energetic, and it was grimy. That single went gold, so Def Jam was very happy about that.\"</blockquote>\n\nIn 1993, in an interview for [[NBC News]] about [[gangsta rap]], [[Russell Simmons]] quotes the Sticky Fingaz's lines from \"Throw Ya Gunz\": ''The fact that there's a lot of gangster records right now, there's a lot of voices from people who had no voice before. Sticky Fingaz said 'I hate your guts and I hope you die, my name is Sticky Fingaz my life is a lie'. I want you to feel it in your chest, i want you understand he is a third generation forty projects, he's dead man. Maybe if they do jobs there, they wouldn't be an angry, but in the meantime he might rob you, that's a reality that white Americans has to live with, that's a reality that kids and boys just beginning to understand.''\n\nIn 2010, [[Fat Joe]] share the story about how he first heard the Onyx's song \"Throw Ya Gunz\" in Club 2000 in [[Harlem]], [[NYC]], saying \"it was one of the most classic hip-hop events I've ever been to\".<ref>{{cite web| url= http://rapdirt.com/fat-joe-on-how-onyx-brought-peace-to-harlem/19840|title=Fat Joe On How Onyx Brought Peace To Harlem| website=rapdirt.com |access-date=2018-09-19}}</ref>\n\nThe song was used as a promo for the 18th season of the American [[animated sitcom]] [[South Park]]. A visionary creative director Robert Sosin told why he chose this song:<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.sosincerely.com/south-park|title=SOUTH PARK 18:HEADS UP| website=sosincerely.com |access-date=2018-09-19}}</ref><blockquote>\"...For the South Park campaign of 2014, we wanted a clear simple message to get people to tune in and a visual theme that could unite creative across many platforms.

At the same time, smaller [[municipalities of Denmark|municipalities]] were merged into larger units, cutting the number of municipalities from 271 before 1 January 2006, when [[\u00c6r\u00f8 Municipality]] was created, to 98. The Capital Region has 29 municipalities. The regional council consists of 41 [[2017 Danish local elections|elected]] politicians. The chairman as of 1 January 2014 is [[Sophie H\u00e6storp Andersen]]. She is a member of the [[Social Democrats (Denmark)|Social Democrats political party]]. The reform was implemented on January 1, 2007. The main task for the Danish regions are hospitals and healthcare. It is not to be confused with the [[Copenhagen metropolitan area|Copenhagen Metropolitan Area]] nor with the [[\u00d8resund Region]]. Unlike the counties (1970-2006) (Danish ''{{ill|Amtskommune|da|vertical-align=sup}}'' literally ''county municipality'') the regions are not municipalities and are thus not allowed to have [[coat of arms]], but only [[logotype]]s, and cannot \"shuffle money around\" from one area of expenditure to another area of expenditure, that is, use money for any other purpose than has been stated specifically, but must pay money not used back rather like departments or agencies of the central government. The regions do not levy any taxes but are financed only through [[block grant]]s.\n\nFor population growth, see [[Regions of Denmark#Population growth|Regions of Denmark]].\n\nFor information about the reform, see [[Municipalities of Denmark]].\n\nMunicipalities of the regions can be accessed from the Municipalities of Denmark template at the bottom of the page.\n\n==Overview==\nThe Capital Region of Denmark is one of five regions in [[Denmark]] and consists of the municipalities of [[Copenhagen]] and [[Frederiksberg]], the former counties of [[Copenhagen County|Copenhagen]] and [[Frederiksborg County|Frederiksborg]], and the regional municipality of [[Bornholm]]. In Danish the name is Region Hovedstaden. It borders [[Region Zealand|Zealand]] and [[Sweden]]'s [[Sk\u00e5ne County]] via the [[\u00d8resund Bridge]].\n\nDenmark's largest lake (Danish ''s\u00f8''), [[Arres\u00f8]], lies 43 kilometers (28 miles) northwest of Copenhagen. There are several other lakes, the deepest in Denmark being [[Fures\u00f8 (lake)|Fures\u00f8]], 14.5&nbsp;km (9 miles) [[Frederiksdal House|northwest]] of Copenhagen, which is the namesake of [[Fures\u00f8 Municipality]]. Among several forests the region also has [[Gribskov]],<ref>[http://naturstyrelsen.dk/drift-og-pleje/arealoversigt/nordsjaelland/  401 Gribskov] Retrieved 20 January 2018</ref> namesake of [[Gribskov Municipality]]. The forest park [[Dyrehaven]] is just north of Copenhagen (and east of Fures\u00f8) in [[Gentofte Municipality|Gentofte]] and [[Lyngby-Taarb\u00e6k Municipality|Lyngby-Taarb\u00e6k]].\n\n[[Geology|Geologically]] the region lies in the northern part of [[Denmark]] which is rising because of [[post-glacial rebound]], making lakes out of former inlets and bays, of which Arres\u00f8 is one example, having extended in a northwesterly direction as a part of [[Br\u00f8demose Sund]] into [[Kattegat]].<ref>[[Den Store Danske Encyklop\u00e6di]], article:Danmark, volume 4, page 542, illustration ''Landskabets dannelse''</ref>(The land is rising by [[Metre|9 millimeters]] every year in Furu\u00f6grund (Swedish Wikipedia {{ill|Furu\u00f6grund|sv|Furu\u00f6grund#Landh\u00f6jningen|vertical-align=sup}}), the northeastern part of [[Skellefte\u00e5 Municipality]], north of [[Kvarken]].) Because of the mobility of the [[Inland dune|sand dunes]], forests have been planted along the coast of [[Kattegat]] in the municipalities of [[Helsing\u00f8r Municipality|Helsing\u00f8r]], [[Gribskov Municipality|Gribskov]], and [[Halsn\u00e6s Municipality|Halsn\u00e6s]].\n\nWithout the remote island municipality Bornholm, located {{convert|150|km|mi|abbr=on}} southeast of Copenhagen and {{convert|135|km|mi|abbr=on}} directly east of [[Vordingborg Municipality]] ([[M\u00f8n]]) (across the [[Baltic Sea]]), and regarding only the land area of the 28 municipalities in and around Copenhagen, between 1,800 and 1,850 sq km (between 700 and 715 sq. mi.), 1,000 inhabitants per sq km will be reached in 2019 with a population as of 1 April 2019 at 1,800,076 persons, and 39,582 persons living on Bornholm.\n\nFor the purpose of the road and rail connection to [[\u00d8resund Bridge]] land has been added to [[Amager]], which has a tunnel connecting it with the artificial island [[Peberholm]] just south of [[Saltholm]]. The land area of east Denmark (east of the [[Great Belt]] [[strait]]) is approximately 9,622 sq km (year?) (3,715 sq mi), possibly slightly more with new land added because of housing projects in the north of [[Copenhagen Municipality]] and the bridge and tunnels including the [[Fehmarn Belt Fixed Link]] and other traffic infrastructure projects. A new [[Copenhagen-Ringsted Line]] came into operation 1 June 2019 to increase transport capacity and relieve congestion in [[Roskilde]] and the narrow 9-9.5 mile [[isthmus]] between [[Roskilde Fjord]] and [[K\u00f8ge Bugt]] by moving international and national train traffic to the new train line and only keeping local and regional traffic.\n\nBefore 2007, a [[Danish Capital Region]] ({{lang-da|Hovedstadsregionen}}) did exist, but it did not cover exactly the same area and did not have the same legal functions.\n\nThe primary function and largest expenditure, around 90% of the budget, of the Capital Region, as with all the regions of Denmark, is to own and operate the hospital and health service of the region.\n\nIn the east of Denmark there is one traffic region covered by [[Movia (transit agency)|Movia]], which is owned by the Capital Region of Denmark and [[Region Zealand]] and 45 of the 46 municipalities. Because of its remote location Bornholm has its own traffic company, [[BAT (transit agency)|BAT]], formerly, when Bornholm was a county, ''Bornholms Amts Trafikselskab''.\n\nLikewise, in the east of Denmark the two regions and 45 of the 46 municipalities make up one employment region, and Bornholm is its own employment region. Bornholm also performs other tasks normally performed by the regions in the rest of Denmark. The municipality of Bornholm is therefore called ''Bornholm Regional Municipality''. In some respects the island forms a region of its own.\n\nAs Denmark is a [[unitary state]], its \"capital region\" is not a [[Capital districts and territories|capital district]], but merely one among several [[regions of Denmark]], that happens to contain the national capital.\n\nThe region does not include the [[Ertholmene]] [[archipelago]] which is situated to the northeast of Bornholm.\n\n== Economy ==\nThe [[Gross domestic product]] (GDP) of the region was 122.2 billion \u20ac in 2018, accounting for 40.6% of Denmarks economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was 50,000 \u20ac or 166% of the EU27 average in the same year. GDP per person employed was 130% of the EU27 average. The Capital Region is the wealthiest region in Denmark.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/2995521/10474907/1-05032020-AP-EN.pdf/81807e19-e4c8-2e53-c98a-933f5bf30f58|title=Regional GDP per capita ranged from 30% to 263% of the EU average in 2018|last=|first=|date=|website=Eurostat|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==Hospitals==\n{{Expand list|date=August 2008}}\nThe following hospitals are managed by the Capital Region of Denmark:\n* [[Amager Hospital]] on the island of [[Amager]], [[Copenhagen]]\n* [[Bispebjerg Hospital]] in Copenhagen\n* [[Bornholms Hospital]] on the island of [[Bornholm]]\n* [[Frederiksberg Hospital]] in [[Frederiksberg]]\n* [[Gentofte Hospital]] in [[Gentofte]]\n* [[Glostrup Hospital]] in [[Glostrup]]\n* [[Herlev Hospital]] in [[Herlev]]\n* [[Hvidovre Hospital]] in [[Hvidovre]]\n* [[Nordsj\u00e6llands Hospital]] in [[Esb\u00f8nderup]], [[Frederikssund]], [[Hiller\u00f8d]], [[Elsinore]], and [[H\u00f8rsholm]]\n* [[Region Hovedstadens Psykiatri]] \u2013 [[psychiatry|psychiatric hospital]] with many centers around the region\n* [[Rigshospitalet]] in Copenhagen\n* [[Sankt Hans Hospital|Sct.

2007 as part of the 2007 Danish Municipal Reform, which abolished the traditional [[counties of Denmark|counties]] (Danish plural: ''amter'', singular: ''amt'') and set up five regions. At the same time, smaller [[municipalities of Denmark|municipalities]] were merged into larger units, cutting the number of municipalities from 271 before 1 January 2006, when [[\u00c6r\u00f8 Municipality]] was created, to 98. The Capital Region has 29 municipalities. The regional council consists of 41 [[2017 Danish local elections|elected]] politicians. The chairman as of 1 January 2014 is [[Sophie H\u00e6storp Andersen]]. She is a member of the [[Social Democrats (Denmark)|Social Democrats political party]]. The reform was implemented on January 1, 2007. The main task for the Danish regions are hospitals and healthcare. It is not to be confused with the [[Copenhagen metropolitan area|Copenhagen Metropolitan Area]] nor with the [[\u00d8resund Region]]. Unlike the counties (1970-2006) (Danish ''{{ill|Amtskommune|da|vertical-align=sup}}'' literally ''county municipality'') the regions are not municipalities and are thus not allowed to have [[coat of arms]], but only [[logotype]]s, and cannot \"shuffle money around\" from one area of expenditure to another area of expenditure, that is, use money for any other purpose than has been stated specifically, but must pay money not used back rather like departments or agencies of the central government. The regions do not levy any taxes but are financed only through [[block grant]]s.\n\nFor population growth, see [[Regions of Denmark#Population growth|Regions of Denmark]].\n\nFor information about the reform, see [[Municipalities of Denmark]].\n\nMunicipalities of the regions can be accessed from the Municipalities of Denmark template at the bottom of the page.\n\n==Overview==\nThe Capital Region of Denmark is one of five regions in [[Denmark]] and consists of the municipalities of [[Copenhagen]] and [[Frederiksberg]], the former counties of [[Copenhagen County|Copenhagen]] and [[Frederiksborg County|Frederiksborg]], and the regional municipality of [[Bornholm]]. In Danish the name is Region Hovedstaden. It borders [[Region Zealand|Zealand]] and [[Sweden]]'s [[Sk\u00e5ne County]] via the [[\u00d8resund Bridge]].\n\nDenmark's largest lake (Danish ''s\u00f8''), [[Arres\u00f8]], lies 43 kilometers (28 miles) northwest of Copenhagen. There are several other lakes, the deepest in Denmark being [[Fures\u00f8 (lake)|Fures\u00f8]], 14.5&nbsp;km (9 miles) [[Frederiksdal House|northwest]] of Copenhagen, which is the namesake of [[Fures\u00f8 Municipality]]. Among several forests the region also has [[Gribskov]],<ref>[http://naturstyrelsen.dk/drift-og-pleje/arealoversigt/nordsjaelland/  401 Gribskov] Retrieved 20 January 2018</ref> namesake of [[Gribskov Municipality]]. The forest park [[Dyrehaven]] is just north of Copenhagen (and east of Fures\u00f8) in [[Gentofte Municipality|Gentofte]] and [[Lyngby-Taarb\u00e6k Municipality|Lyngby-Taarb\u00e6k]].\n\n[[Geology|Geologically]] the region lies in the northern part of [[Denmark]] which is rising because of [[post-glacial rebound]], making lakes out of former inlets and bays, of which Arres\u00f8 is one example, having extended in a northwesterly direction as a part of [[Br\u00f8demose Sund]] into [[Kattegat]].<ref>[[Den Store Danske Encyklop\u00e6di]], article:Danmark, volume 4, page 542, illustration ''Landskabets dannelse''</ref>(The land is rising by [[Metre|9 millimeters]] every year in Furu\u00f6grund (Swedish Wikipedia {{ill|Furu\u00f6grund|sv|Furu\u00f6grund#Landh\u00f6jningen|vertical-align=sup}}), the northeastern part of [[Skellefte\u00e5 Municipality]], north of [[Kvarken]].) Because of the mobility of the [[Inland dune|sand dunes]], forests have been planted along the coast of [[Kattegat]] in the municipalities of [[Helsing\u00f8r Municipality|Helsing\u00f8r]], [[Gribskov Municipality|Gribskov]], and [[Halsn\u00e6s Municipality|Halsn\u00e6s]].\n\nWithout the remote island municipality Bornholm, located {{convert|150|km|mi|abbr=on}} southeast of Copenhagen and {{convert|135|km|mi|abbr=on}} directly east of [[Vordingborg Municipality]] ([[M\u00f8n]]) (across the [[Baltic Sea]]), and regarding only the land area of the 28 municipalities in and around Copenhagen, between 1,800 and 1,850 sq km (between 700 and 715 sq. mi.), 1,000 inhabitants per sq km will be reached in 2019 with a population as of 1 April 2019 at 1,800,076 persons, and 39,582 persons living on Bornholm.\n\nFor the purpose of the road and rail connection to [[\u00d8resund Bridge]] land has been added to [[Amager]], which has a tunnel connecting it with the artificial island [[Peberholm]] just south of [[Saltholm]]. The land area of east Denmark (east of the [[Great Belt]] [[strait]]) is approximately 9,622 sq km (year?) (3,715 sq mi), possibly slightly more with new land added because of housing projects in the north of [[Copenhagen Municipality]] and the bridge and tunnels including the [[Fehmarn Belt Fixed Link]] and other traffic infrastructure projects. A new [[Copenhagen-Ringsted Line]] came into operation 1 June 2019 to increase transport capacity and relieve congestion in [[Roskilde]] and the narrow 9-9.5 mile [[isthmus]] between [[Roskilde Fjord]] and [[K\u00f8ge Bugt]] by moving international and national train traffic to the new train line and only keeping local and regional traffic.\n\nBefore 2007, a [[Danish Capital Region]] ({{lang-da|Hovedstadsregionen}}) did exist, but it did not cover exactly the same area and did not have the same legal functions.\n\nThe primary function and largest expenditure, around 90% of the budget, of the Capital Region, as with all the regions of Denmark, is to own and operate the hospital and health service of the region.\n\nIn the east of Denmark there is one traffic region covered by [[Movia (transit agency)|Movia]], which is owned by the Capital Region of Denmark and [[Region Zealand]] and 45 of the 46 municipalities. Because of its remote location Bornholm has its own traffic company, [[BAT (transit agency)|BAT]], formerly, when Bornholm was a county, ''Bornholms Amts Trafikselskab''.\n\nLikewise, in the east of Denmark the two regions and 45 of the 46 municipalities make up one employment region, and Bornholm is its own employment region. Bornholm also performs other tasks normally performed by the regions in the rest of Denmark. The municipality of Bornholm is therefore called ''Bornholm Regional Municipality''. In some respects the island forms a region of its own.\n\nAs Denmark is a [[unitary state]], its \"capital region\" is not a [[Capital districts and territories|capital district]], but merely one among several [[regions of Denmark]], that happens to contain the national capital.\n\nThe region does not include the [[Ertholmene]] [[archipelago]] which is situated to the northeast of Bornholm.\n\n== Economy ==\nThe [[Gross domestic product]] (GDP) of the region was 122.2 billion \u20ac in 2018, accounting for 40.6% of Denmarks economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was 50,000 \u20ac or 166% of the EU27 average in the same year. GDP per person employed was 130% of the EU27 average. The Capital Region is the wealthiest region in Denmark.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/2995521/10474907/1-05032020-AP-EN.pdf/81807e19-e4c8-2e53-c98a-933f5bf30f58|title=Regional GDP per capita ranged from 30% to 263% of the EU average in 2018|last=|first=|date=|website=Eurostat|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==Hospitals==\n{{Expand list|date=August 2008}}\nThe following hospitals are managed by the Capital Region of Denmark:\n* [[Amager Hospital]] on the island of [[Amager]], [[Copenhagen]]\n* [[Bispebjerg Hospital]] in Copenhagen\n* [[Bornholms Hospital]] on the island of [[Bornholm]]\n* [[Frederiksberg Hospital]] in [[Frederiksberg]]\n* [[Gentofte Hospital]] in [[Gentofte]]\n* [[Glostrup Hospital]] in [[Glostrup]]\n* [[Herlev Hospital]] in [[Herlev]]\n* [[Hvidovre Hospital]] in [[Hvidovre]]\n* [[Nordsj\u00e6llands Hospital]] in [[Esb\u00f8nderup]], [[Frederikssund]], [[Hiller\u00f8d]], [[Elsinore]], and [[H\u00f8rsholm]]\n* [[Region Hovedstadens Psykiatri]] \u2013 [[psychiatry|psychiatric hospital]] with many centers around the region\n* [[Rigshospitalet]] in Copenhagen\n* [[Sankt Hans Hospital|Sct.

Reunited with ''[[Off the Wall]]'' producer [[Quincy Jones]], Jackson was inspired to create an album where \"every song was a killer\". With the ongoing backlash against [[disco]], Jackson moved in a new musical direction, incorporating [[pop music|pop]], [[post-disco]], [[contemporary R&B|R&B]], [[rock music|rock]] and [[funk]]. ''Thriller'' features a single guest appearance, with [[Paul McCartney]] becoming the first artist to be featured on Jackson's albums. Recording took place from April to November 1982 at [[Westlake Recording Studios]] in [[Los Angeles]], with a production budget of $750,000.\n\n''Thriller'' became Jackson's first number one album on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. It produced seven singles: \"[[The Girl Is Mine]]\", \"[[Billie Jean]]\", \"[[Beat It]]\", \"[[Wanna Be Startin' Somethin']]{{thinsp}}\", \"[[Human Nature (Michael Jackson song)|Human Nature]]\", \"[[P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)]]\", and \"[[Thriller (song)|Thriller]]\". All the singles reached the top 10 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart, setting the record for the [[List of Billboard Hot 100 chart achievements and milestones#Most top ten singles from one album|most top 10 singles from an album]], with \"Beat It\" and \"Billie Jean\" reaching number one on the chart. Following Jackson's performance of \"Billie Jean\" at ''[[Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever]]'', where he debuted his signature [[Moonwalk (dance)|moonwalk]] dance, the sales of the album significantly increased, selling one million copies worldwide per week. ''[[Michael Jackson's Thriller (music video)|Michael Jackson's Thriller]],'' the \"Thriller\" music video, was premiered to great anticipation in December 1983 and played regularly on [[MTV]], which also increased the sales of the album. By the end of 1983, ''Thriller'' became the best-selling album of all time, having sold 32 million copies. It was the best-selling album worldwide of 1983 and 1984, and was also the [[List of best-selling albums by year in the United States|best-selling album in the United States]] in 1983 and 1984, making it the first album to be the country's best-selling for two years. It spent a record 37 weeks at number one on the ''Billboard'' 200, from February 26, 1983 to April 14, 1984, and has spent 400 weeks on the chart and counting.\n\n''Thriller''{{'}}s success set the standard for the music industry with its songs, music videos and promotion strategies influencing artists, record labels, producers, marketers and choreographers. In 1984, a [[pop art]] of Jackson designed by [[Andy Warhol]] was featured on the cover of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' who acclaimed the impact of the album, writing, \"The pulse of America and much of the rest of the world moves irregularly, beating in time to the tough strut of 'Billie Jean', the asphalt aria of 'Beat It', the supremely cool chills of 'Thriller'.\" The album broke [[Racism in the United States#African Americans|racial barriers]] in [[popular music]], enabling Jackson's appearances on MTV and meeting with [[President of the United States|President]] [[Ronald Reagan]] at the [[White House]]. It was one of the first to use [[music video]]s as successful promotional tools, and the videos for the songs \"Billie Jean\" and \"Beat It\" and the [[short film]] ''Michael Jackson's Thriller'' all received regular rotation on MTV and are credited for [[Cultural impact of Michael Jackson#Music videos|transforming music videos into a serious art form]], with the latter also [[Michael Jackson's Thriller (music video)#Legacy|popularizing short films]] in the music industry.\n\n''Thriller'' remains the [[List of best-selling albums|best-selling album of all time]], with sales of 66 million copies worldwide. It is the [[List of best-selling albums in the United States|second-best-selling album in the United States]] and was the first to reach [[List of best-selling albums in the United States#More than or equal to 20 million copies|30\u00d7 Platinum]] or 3\u00d7 Diamond. As of February 2017, it has sold 33 million certified [[album-equivalent unit]]s in the US.

Its promotional strategy, which led to seven of its nine tracks being released as singles, raised the bar for what, exactly, constituted a \"hit-laden\" LP.

Reunited with ''[[Off the Wall]]'' producer [[Quincy Jones]], Jackson was inspired to create an album where \"every song was a killer\". With the ongoing backlash against [[disco]], Jackson moved in a new musical direction, incorporating [[pop music|pop]], [[post-disco]], [[contemporary R&B|R&B]], [[rock music|rock]] and [[funk]]. ''Thriller'' features a single guest appearance, with [[Paul McCartney]] becoming the first artist to be featured on Jackson's albums. Recording took place from April to November 1982 at [[Westlake Recording Studios]] in [[Los Angeles]], with a production budget of $750,000. \n\n''Thriller'' became Jackson's first number one album on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. It produced seven singles: \"[[The Girl Is Mine]]\", \"[[Billie Jean]]\", \"[[Beat It]]\", \"[[Wanna Be Startin' Somethin']]{{thinsp}}\", \"[[Human Nature (Michael Jackson song)|Human Nature]]\", \"[[P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)]]\", and \"[[Thriller (song)|Thriller]]\". All the singles reached the top 10 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart, setting the record for the [[List of Billboard Hot 100 chart achievements and milestones#Most top ten singles from one album|most top 10 singles from an album]], with \"Beat It\" and \"Billie Jean\" reaching number one on the chart. Following Jackson's performance of \"Billie Jean\" at ''[[Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever]]'', where he debuted his signature [[Moonwalk (dance)|moonwalk]] dance, the sales of the album significantly increased, selling one million copies worldwide per week. ''[[Michael Jackson's Thriller (music video)|Michael Jackson's Thriller]],'' the \"Thriller\" music video, was premiered to great anticipation in December 1983 and played regularly on [[MTV]], which also increased the sales of the album. By the end of 1983, ''Thriller'' became the best-selling album of all time, having sold 32 million copies. It was the best-selling album worldwide of 1983 and 1984, and was also the [[List of best-selling albums by year in the United States|best-selling album in the United States]] in 1983 and 1984, making it the first album to be the country's best-selling for two years. It spent a record 37 weeks at number one on the ''Billboard'' 200, from February 26, 1983 to April 14, 1984, and has spent 400 weeks on the chart and counting.\n\n''Thriller''{{'}}s success set the standard for the music industry with its songs, music videos and promotion strategies influencing artists, record labels, producers, marketers and choreographers. In 1984, a [[pop art]] of Jackson designed by [[Andy Warhol]] was featured on the cover of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' who acclaimed the impact of the album, writing, \"The pulse of America and much of the rest of the world moves irregularly, beating in time to the tough strut of 'Billie Jean', the asphalt aria of 'Beat It', the supremely cool chills of 'Thriller'.\" The album broke [[Racism in the United States#African Americans|racial barriers]] in [[popular music]], enabling Jackson's appearances on MTV and meeting with [[President of the United States|President]] [[Ronald Reagan]] at the [[White House]]. It was one of the first to use [[music video]]s as successful promotional tools, and the videos for the songs \"Billie Jean\" and \"Beat It\" and the [[short film]] ''Michael Jackson's Thriller'' all received regular rotation on MTV and are credited for [[Cultural impact of Michael Jackson#Music videos|transforming music videos into a serious art form]], with the latter also [[Michael Jackson's Thriller (music video)#Legacy|popularizing short films]] in the music industry.\n\n''Thriller'' remains the [[List of best-selling albums|best-selling album of all time]], with sales of 66 million copies worldwide.
