The male singers who had the same range I did, when I was growing up, didn't do much for me. But put on Nina Simone, [[Carmen McRae]] or [[Nancy Wilson (jazz singer)|Nancy Wilson]], and I'd be in seventh heaven.

He recalled: \"Well you know, it was something that my mum would say I needed, holding my notes you know, and delivering my notes. It gave me assurity, cos my mother was 100% behind me and it created the style and uniqueness of Billy Paul. All my life I wanted to sound like myself, I never wanted to sound like anybody else.

He changed his name from Paul Williams to Billy Paul so as to avoid any confusion with other artists such as songwriter [[Paul Williams (songwriter)|Paul Williams]] and saxophonist [[Paul Williams (saxophonist)|Paul \"Hucklebuck\" Williams]]. He explained: \"I had Jules Malvin, who was like my play father. He was my manager at the time.

We were in Germany and we said we're going to start a band, so we didn\u2019t have to do any hard work in the service. We tried to get Elvis to join but he wanted to be a jeep driver. So me and Gary Crosby, we started it and called ourselves the Jazz Blues Symphony Band. Some famous people came out of that band; [[Cedar Walton]], [[Eddie Harris]] and we toured all over Germany. Elvis didn\u2019t wanna join us. I used to see him every day but he drove the jeep for the Colonel. He didn\u2019t want to join our band. He wanted to get away from music for a while, while he was in the service you know.<ref name=bluesandsoul.com />}} \n\nPaul and the other members of the 7th Army Band, including [[Don Ellis]], [[Leo Wright]] and [[Ron Anthony]], used the service to further their musical careers as best they could\u2014careers they knew would continue once they returned to civilian life. Paul said: \"I sang in the service, I sang with a jazz band. So when I came out I sang Jazz, going to clubs and so forth.<ref name=bluesandsoul.com />\n\nPaul also did some boxing in the Army \u2013 a sport he had grown up with, as he explained in a 2012 interview: \"Yeah we had a gym and all my friends from my neighborhood were boxers. Even during my army days I boxed as well as singing. Actually I still go to the gym; both me and my wife have trainers... [[Miles Davis]] would always say: 'Come to the gym! I'm gonna beat your ass!'

Paul recalled: \"I was one of the Blue Notes at one time and Marvin Gaye was in [[the Moonglows]].... We were such good friends. We never did a record together and that would have been one of my dreams. And you know what one of my fascinations is? What we would be doing if he were here today. I think about Marvin every day. The love I have for this man is unbelievable. We were close, we were like brothers.

I was born here and so many great and influential artists come from here as well. Its a city of its own and has its own sound. I think what makes it different is the drama; you know how they say everyone marches to their own beat? Well i think Philly has its own beat as well, and it's distinctive. It sounds easy, but it's hard to play.\"<ref name=movievortex.com />\n\n====Neptune and Gamble releases====\n\nPaul and his wife and manager Blanche Williams were in the process of recording his debut album when they met [[Kenny Gamble]]. Paul recalled:\n\n[[File:The Beatles in America.JPG|thumb|200px|left|Billy Paul cited [[the Beatles]] as the key influence on his musical growth from jazz to other musical genres.]]\n\n{{quote|I was singing in a jazz club called the Sahara. He had a record shop on South St & Philly \u2013 right round the corner and I was singing with a trio at the Sahara club on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. He came over and said 'I am starting a record company and I would like to sign you.' {{sic|Low}} and behold I took all the material I sung every weekend and I did an album in three and a half hours \u2013 a whole album. I had this album, and I produced it \u2013 me and my wife. And we gave him this album called ''[[Feelin' Good at the Cadillac Club]]'' to help start the record company and that was the album that helped start it up. I was singing totally Jazz then, but when I heard [[the Beatles]] and heard the gospel influence and everything I just said: 'I can make jazz with R&B.' That transition came when The Beatles came out to America. When I heard The Beatles that was my turning point. They were like my mentors. You know the funny thing about that, when I heard (Billy sings) '[[I Wanna Hold Your Hand]]', at first I said these guys are like a flash in the pan.

Largely a collection of jazz covers of songs popularized by others, it was a studio album that attempted to recreate the feel of Paul's live club performances. Neither the single \"Bluesette\" nor the album reached the charts. The album was re-released in 1973.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/apr/26/billy-paul-five-best-soul-music-me-and-mrs-jones|title=Billy Paul: five of the best from the soul maestro who created an all-time classic|last=Ma|first=David|date=2016-04-26|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2016-04-27}}</ref>\n\nPaul's second LP, ''[[Ebony Woman]]'' (1970), was a more commercial release on [[Gamble & Huff]]'s [[Neptune Records|Neptune label]]. Paul cut a new version of his 1959 single and made it the title track. Gamble & Huff were firmly in control of the production. Merging jazz and soul, the LP achieved some modest success reaching No. 12 on the ''Billboard'' soul chart an No. 183 on the pop chart.\n\n====Philadelphia International releases====\n\nAfter Neptune folded, Gamble and Huff started their third label \u2013 [[Philadelphia International Records]] (PIR) \u2013 and brought Paul with them. Gamble and Huff signed a distribution deal with [[Clive Davis]] and [[CBS Records International|CBS Records]].\n\n''[[Going East]]'' (1971) was the first Billy Paul album released on the Philadelphia International Records label, making full use of the label's regular group of ace musicians [[MFSB]] at [[Sigma Sound Studios]]. As they had done on the previous LP, Gamble and Huff sought to find the balance between Paul's jazz roots and the funky soul that they hoped would  bring mainstream success. Paul nearly reached the charts with the single \"Magic Carpet Ride\" (cover of the 1968 [[Steppenwolf (band)|Steppenwolf]] hit) and the album climbed to No. 42 on the ''Billboard'' soul chart and No. 197 on the pop chart.\n\n{{quote box|align=left|width=20em|quote=The good thing about Gamble and Huff is, nobody sounded alike, everybody had their own sound and that was the distinctive part that kept coming.|source=-Billy Paul<ref name=bluesandsoul.com />}}\n\n=====\"Me and Mrs. Jones\" and international fame=====\n\nWith each album, Gamble and Huff were moving closer to realizing the sound they envisioned for Billy Paul, and they achieved it with the 1972 album ''[[360 Degrees of Billy Paul]]'' and the single \"[[Me and Mrs. Jones]]\". Both the album and song received commercial and critical acclaim.\n\n\"Me and Mrs. Jones\" was a [[Hot 100 No. 1 Hits of 1972 (USA)|No. 1 hit]] for the last three weeks of 1972, selling two million copies (platinum single status), and went on to win Paul a [[Grammy Award for Best Male R&B Vocal Performance|Grammy Award]]. The [[Music recording sales certification|gold album]] and [[Music recording sales certification|platinum single]] broke the artist on world charts, including the United Kingdom, where the single entered the [[Top 40|Top 20]] of the [[UK Singles Chart]], reaching No. 12 in early 1973.<ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\">{{cite book| first= David | last= Roberts | year= 2006 | title= British Hit Singles & Albums | edition= 19th | publisher= Guinness World Records Limited | location= London | isbn= 1-904994-10-5 | page= 420}}</ref> In the years since then, the song has been covered numerous times, most notably by [[the Dramatics]] in 1974, [[Freddie Jackson]] in 1992 and [[Michael Bubl\u00e9]] in 2007. Paul recalled the Grammy win and the song's overall success: \"Oh man! I was up against [[Ray Charles]], I was up against [[Curtis Mayfield]], I was up against [[Isaac Hayes]]. I was in the Wilberforce University in Ohio, I had to go do a homecoming \u2013 my wife and her mother went. And when I see [[Ringo Starr]] call my name, I said Ohhh... Yeah...

In addition, the label was enjoying considerable success with their other artists, including [[the O'Jays]] and [[Harold Melvin & the Blue Notes]].

It was like music round the clock, you know.\"<ref name=bluesandsoul.com />\n\n[[File:Clive Davis.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Music executive [[Clive Davis]] has consistently praised Paul's recording of \"[[Am I Black Enough for You?

There was and continues to be much controversy surrounding the choice to release this track as the follow-up to a cross-over smash hit.\n\nIn a 1977 interview, Paul made plain that he opposed the choice from the beginning: \n{{quote|I think though that a lot of mistakes were made at the time. The biggest one was releasing 'Am I Black Enough For You' straight after 'Mrs. Jones'. People weren't ready for that kind of a song after the pop success of 'Mrs. Jones'.

But though it was a company mistake, I'm still satisfied with both CBS and Philadelphia International.

I wanted \u2013 I'm gonna make it this time and come out. I think it's true to the audience, cos they look for something to come out compared to Mrs. Jones and that was [[Clive Davis]]' idea to do that.

For a long time I was angry about it, I had a bit of a letdown. Now the song is ahead of its time.<ref name=bluesandsoul.com /> I feel as though I let the song down when I went into my darkness.

Despite the disappointment over the chart performance of \"Am I Black Enough\", there was no reason to believe that he could not replicate the album's success or reach even greater heights. In May 1973, while still promoting ''360 Degrees of Billy Paul'', he was asked about a follow-up LP: \"I'm afraid that there will be something of a delay. As of right now, there are two sides actually completed. I have to tell you about one of them \u2014 [[Gamble and Huff|Kenny and Leon]] wrote it especially and it's a definite single at some point. It's called 'I Was Married' and I honestly think it will be bigger than 'Me and Mrs. Jones'. But for me, there are still two singles from the ''[[360 Degrees of Billy Paul|360 Degrees]]'' album \u2014 'Brown Baby' and 'I'm Just a Prisoner'. But, we are starting to work on the album more seriously from May 15.\" Despite Paul's enthusiasm, neither \"Brown Baby\" or \"I'm Just a Prisoner\" were released in U.S., although \"Brown Baby\" was issued in the UK but failed to chart.\n\n\"[[Me and Mrs. Jones]]\" was such a huge hit that Gamble and Huff decided to re-release Paul's first two albums, ''[[Feelin' Good at the Cadillac Club]]'' and ''[[Ebony Woman]]''. Reissued in 1973, both albums featured new cover art and were a boon to new fans hungry for Billy Paul product who had already purchased his first two [[Philadelphia International Records|PIR]] LPs. Still, neither reissue was terribly successful, with only ''Ebony Woman'' re-entering the album charts at No. 186 Pop and No. 43 Soul.\n\nPaul's next album, ''[[War of the Gods (album)|War of the Gods]]'', was the follow-up to ''360 Degrees of Billy Paul'' and was issued in November 1973. Unique in Paul's catalog, it contains lengthy [[psychedelic soul]], song suites and marked a conceptual and musical advance for Paul that did not go unrecognized by critics and fans. And while the LP and its singles enjoyed some success, Paul was unable to repeat the kind of wide impact he had with his previous album and \"Mrs. Jones\". The ''War of the Gods'' single \"Thanks for Saving My Life\", backed with \"I Was Married\" as the B-side, was a top-40 hit, reaching No. 37 on the pop chart and a top-10 soul record, reaching No. 9. It also reached No. 33 in the UK.\n\nPaul's 1973 European tour with [[the O'Jays]] and [[The Intruders (music group)|the Intruders]] spawned his first true live album: ''[[Live in Europe (Billy Paul album)|Live in Europe]]''. Recorded in London and released in 1974, it reached No. 10 on the ''Billboard'' Soul Album chart and No. 187 on the pop chart.\n\n''[[Got My Head on Straight]]'' was released in 1975 and was an attempt to return to the successful formula of ''360 Degrees of Billy Paul''. A collection of jazzy, soulful, funky, pop songs, it reached No. 140 on the ''Billboard'' Pop Album chart and No. 20 on the Soul chart. It included the singles \"Be Truthful to Me\" (No. 37 R&B); \"Billy's Back Home\" (No. 52 R&B); and \"July, July, July, July\", which did not chart. Despite the attempted return to form, the lack of mainstream success was a major disappointment to Paul, Gamble and Huff, and everyone at PIR.\n\n=====Jesse Jackson controversy=====\n\n[[File:THE REV.

Released in December 1975, it reached No. 139 on the ''Billboard'' Pop Album chart and No. 17 on the Soul chart. It included the singles \"Let's Make a Baby\", which hit No. 83 on the Pop singles chart (the last record of Paul's to make that chart), No. 18 on the Soul chart and No. 30 in the UK, and \"People Power\", which reached No. 82 on the Soul chart and No. 14 on the U.S. Dance chart.\n\n{{quote box|align=left|width=29em|quote=Come on, come on, let's make a baby<br>\nOh, baby, come on, come on<br>\nLet's bring another life into this world<br>\nA little boy, a little girl<br>\nTake my hand while we walk slowly to the room<br>\nCan't you see tonight I'm gonna make sweet, sweet love to you?<br>\n....

The title track was a funky soul version of [[Paul McCartney]]'s No. 3 U.S. hit from earlier that summer.

Paul also had his usual success on the Soul charts, with the album hitting No. 27 and the singles \"How Good is Your Game,\" \"I Trust You,\" and \"[[Let 'Em In]]\" reaching Nos. 50, 79, and 91 respectively. Paul's version of the [[Elton John]] hit \"[[Your Song]]\" cracked the top 40 in the U.K., reaching No. 38.\n\n=====Final PIR recordings=====\n\nPaul released ''[[Only the Strong Survive (Billy Paul album)|Only the Strong Survive]]'' in 1977 and it proved to be his final charting album, reaching No. 152 on the Pop chart and No. 36 Soul. The LP's title track was the first single, reaching No. 68 on the Soul chart and No. 33 in the UK. The next time Paul's voice would be heard during the summer of 1977 was on the track \"Let's Clean Up the Ghetto\", featuring the \"Philadelphia International All-Stars\": Billy Paul, [[Lou Rawls]], [[Archie Bell (singer)|Archie Bell]], [[Teddy Pendergrass]], [[Dee Dee Sharp]] Gamble, and [[Eddie Levert]] and Walter Williams of [[The O'Jays]]. The song reached No. 91 on the Pop chart and No. 4 on the Soul chart. The ''Let's Clean Up the Ghetto'' album also included the Billy Paul tracks (both written by [[Gamble & Huff]]) \"New Day\" and \"New World Comin'\". All proceeds from the album and single went toward a program to benefit inner-cities throughout the U.S. Paul followed up the success of both his \"Only the Strong Survive\" single and \"Let's Clean Up the Ghetto\" with \"Sooner or Later\" \u2013 another track from his latest LP. Yet the track failed to chart as did \"Don't Give Up on Us\" and \"Everybody's Breaking Up\", which was officially released in the U.K. but only issued to radio in the U.S.\n\nPaul's final studio album for [[Philadelphia International Records|Philadelphia International]] was ''[[First Class (Billy Paul album)|First Class]]'', released in 1979. It was the first album since his 1968 debut ''[[Feelin' Good at the Cadillac Club]]'' that did not make either the Pop or Soul charts. The LP's first single \"Bring the Family Back\" failed to chart but a 12\" [[disco]] version did reach No. 90 on the Soul chart and No. 51 on the Dance chart. \"False Faces\" was also released in both single and 12\" [[disco]] versions but neither charted.\n\nPaul's run at Philadelphia International officially ended with the 1980 release ''[[Best of Billy Paul]]''. This double-album compilation included four previously unreleased tracks: \"You're My Sweetness,\" \"Next to Nature,\" \"What Are We Going to Do Now That He's Back,\" and \"My Old Flame.\" The UK version was a single LP titled ''Billy Paul's Greatest Hits'' with a different track listing and only one of the \"new\" songs: \"You're My Sweetness\". That song was released as a single and reached No. 69 on the Soul chart. Paul's final single for Philadelphia International was an edited version of a song from his first Philadelphia International album ''[[Going East]]'': \"Jesus Boy (You Only Look Like a Man)\", which failed to chart.\n\nNumerous \"best of\" compilations of Paul's Philadelphia International work have been released over the years, though critics have made plain that most have failed to capture the right balance of singles and album tracks to fully represent the depth and breadth of his PIR output. For example, [[AllMusic]]'s Andrew Hamilton said of the 2002 collection ''Super Hits'': \"If you didn't live and die with Billy Paul's albums when he cranked them out on Philadelphia International Records, you won't have a clue as to what his fans want to hear. To compile a CD from Paul's singles is to compile a mediocre collection; you have to supplement the singles with choice LP cuts. And with a brief ten-track collection like this, some of the singles should have been replaced with a few of Paul's icy album joints.\"<ref>{{Allmusic |class=album |id=collection-mw0000218003 |tab=review |label=''Collection'' Review |first=Andrew |last=Hamilton |accessdate=June 28, 2015}}</ref> By contrast, Jason Ankeny said that the 1999 compilation ''Me & Mrs. Jones: Best of Billy Paul'' \"goes far beyond the classic title track in restoring the singer to prominence, showcasing his versatility via superb covers of pop favorites....

His deeply soulful voice bridged the gap between jazz and soul, textured in equal measure by street-smart swagger and touching vulnerability.\"<ref name=Ankeny />\n\n===Post-PIR studio recordings===\n\nPaul made two studio albums in the 1980s. The first, ''Lately'', was released in 1985 and was a dramatic musical departure from the lush [[Philadelphia Soul]] of his previous efforts. Recorded for [[Lonnie Simmons]]' [[Total Experience Records]], the album's synthesizer and keyboard-driven tracks (typical of music production at the time) were closer to Simmons' work with [[the Gap Band]] and [[Yarbrough and Peoples]] than they were to Paul's '70s orchestrated wall of sound. The album's title track, a ballad, was released as a single in the U.K. but did not chart. The follow-up single \u2013 a slow jam called \"Sexual Therapy\" \u2013 fared better, climbing to No. 80 on the U.K. charts.\n\nPaul's final studio album was 1988's ''Wide Open'' for the [[Ichiban Records|Ichiban]] label. Similar in production style to his previous release, though perhaps a bit smoother, it reached No. 61 on the Soul chart. However, the singles \"We Could Have Been\" and \"I Just Love You So Much\" failed to chart.\n\n===\"Retirement\" years===\n\nPaul announced his retirement in 1989 on stage in London.<ref>{{cite news| first=Paul |last=Connolly |title=Critic's Rock |work=The Times|location=London | date=January 3, 2004 }}</ref> But like so many artists before him, he could not resist the temptation to continue to play live shows and record.

Asked in 2012 whether playing in Philadelphia held special meaning to him, he said: \"I try to feel comfortable wherever I play, but they call it being a native son and I do get a lot of respect there so it is special. The reaction internationally is great as well, so even in Paris or Brazil we have great audiences. Songs like [[Me and Mrs. Jones|Mrs. Jones]] are huge everywhere so I do perform a lot overseas.\"<ref name=\"movievortex.com\" />\n\nIn 2000 he released a CD \u2013 ''Live World Tour 1999\u20132000'' \u2013 on his own label, ''PhillySounds''.

Titled ''Your Songs: Live in Paris'', it was recorded in December 2000 at a private event for the RFM TV Channel at Studio 287 in Paris, France. It includes the songs \"July, July, July, July\", \"Only the Strong Survive\", \"[[It's Too Late (Carole King song)|It's Too Late]]\", \"Brown Baby\", \"Let 'Em In\", \"It's Critical\", \"False Faces\", and \"Let's Clean Up the Ghetto\", among others.<ref>{{Allmusic |class=album |id=your-songs-mw0000743353 |tab=review |label=''Your Songs'' Review |accessdate=June 18, 2015}}</ref>\n\n{{quote box|align=left|width=30em|quote=I\u2019ve always worked hard to create my own style.

Paul was identified by his diverse vocal style, which ranged from mellow and soulful to low and raspy. [[Questlove]] of [[the Roots]] equated Paul to [[Marvin Gaye]] and [[Stevie Wonder]], calling him \"one of the criminally unmentioned proprietors of socially conscious post-revolution '60s civil rights music.\"<ref name=Azerrad>{{cite web| first=Michael |last=Azerrad |title=THE BILLY PAUL DOC: AM I DISSEMBLING ENOUGH FOR YOU? |publisher=You and What Army |url=http://michaelazerrad.typepad.com/you_and_what_army/2010/07/billy_paul_doc.html |date=July 26, 2010 |accessdate=June 7, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Life and career==\n\n===Early years===\nPaul was raised in [[North Philadelphia]].

Feb. 1947 (William P. Gottlieb 04251).jpg|thumb|175px|right|Billy Paul was heavily influenced by female jazz vocalists, perhaps none more than [[Billie Holiday]].]]\n\nPaul explained why he was particularly influenced by female jazz singers: \"I think the reason behind that is because of my high range. The male singers who had the same range I did, when I was growing up, didn't do much for me. But put on Nina Simone, [[Carmen McRae]] or [[Nancy Wilson (jazz singer)|Nancy Wilson]], and I'd be in seventh heaven. Female vocalists just did more with their voices, and that's why I paid more attention to them.\"<ref name=Bronson/> Perhaps the female vocalist who had the most impact on him was [[Billie Holiday]], whom he called \"a BIG influence.\"<ref name=bluesandsoul.com/> He began developing a vocal style that would eventually incorporate traces of [[jazz]], [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]], and [[Pop music|pop]].\n\nHe began his singing career at the age of 11, appearing on local radio station [[WKDN (AM)|WPEN]], then owned by the local ''[[Philadelphia Bulletin]]'' newspaper.<ref name=Bronson/> He attended the West Philadelphia Music School and the [[Granoff School of Music]] for formal vocal training. He recalled: \"Well you know, it was something that my mum would say I needed, holding my notes you know, and delivering my notes. It gave me assurity, cos my mother was 100% behind me and it created the style and uniqueness of Billy Paul. All my life I wanted to sound like myself, I never wanted to sound like anybody else. How that occurred was cause I always wanted to be a saxophone player....I took my uniqueness and treated it like a horn, which created a good style for me.\"<ref name=bluesandsoul.com/>\n\n{{quote|When I was 16, I played the Club Harlem in Philly and I was on the same bill as [[Charlie Parker]].

Bird told me if I kept struggling I'd go a long way, and I've never forgotten his words.|Billy Paul<ref name=Bronson/>}}\n\nPaul's popularity grew and led to appearances in clubs and at college campuses nationally. He changed his name from Paul Williams to Billy Paul so as to avoid any confusion with other artists such as songwriter [[Paul Williams (songwriter)|Paul Williams]] and saxophonist [[Paul Williams (saxophonist)|Paul \"Hucklebuck\" Williams]]. He explained: \"I had Jules Malvin, who was like my play father. He was my manager at the time. He took me up to the [[Apollo Theater|Apollo]] and I warmed the Apollo for six weeks and that\u2019s where he gave me the name Billy Paul.

Elvis didn\u2019t wanna join us. I used to see him every day but he drove the jeep for the Colonel. He didn\u2019t want to join our band.

Paul recalled:\n\n[[File:The Beatles in America.JPG|thumb|200px|left|Billy Paul cited [[the Beatles]] as the key influence on his musical growth from jazz to other musical genres.]]\n\n{{quote|I was singing in a jazz club called the Sahara.

I had this album, and I produced it \u2013 me and my wife. And we gave him this album called ''[[Feelin' Good at the Cadillac Club]]'' to help start the record company and that was the album that helped start it up. I was singing totally Jazz then, but when I heard [[the Beatles]] and heard the gospel influence and everything I just said: 'I can make jazz with R&B.' That transition came when The Beatles came out to America. When I heard The Beatles that was my turning point. They were like my mentors.

Largely a collection of jazz covers of songs popularized by others, it was a studio album that attempted to recreate the feel of Paul's live club performances. Neither the single \"Bluesette\" nor the album reached the charts. The album was re-released in 1973.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/apr/26/billy-paul-five-best-soul-music-me-and-mrs-jones|title=Billy Paul: five of the best from the soul maestro who created an all-time classic|last=Ma|first=David|date=2016-04-26|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2016-04-27}}</ref>\n\nPaul's second LP, ''[[Ebony Woman]]'' (1970), was a more commercial release on [[Gamble & Huff]]'s [[Neptune Records|Neptune label]]. Paul cut a new version of his 1959 single and made it the title track. Gamble & Huff were firmly in control of the production. Merging jazz and soul, the LP achieved some modest success reaching No. 12 on the ''Billboard'' soul chart an No. 183 on the pop chart.\n\n====Philadelphia International releases====\n\nAfter Neptune folded, Gamble and Huff started their third label \u2013 [[Philadelphia International Records]] (PIR) \u2013 and brought Paul with them. Gamble and Huff signed a distribution deal with [[Clive Davis]] and [[CBS Records International|CBS Records]].\n\n''[[Going East]]'' (1971) was the first Billy Paul album released on the Philadelphia International Records label, making full use of the label's regular group of ace musicians [[MFSB]] at [[Sigma Sound Studios]]. As they had done on the previous LP, Gamble and Huff sought to find the balance between Paul's jazz roots and the funky soul that they hoped would  bring mainstream success. Paul nearly reached the charts with the single \"Magic Carpet Ride\" (cover of the 1968 [[Steppenwolf (band)|Steppenwolf]] hit) and the album climbed to No. 42 on the ''Billboard'' soul chart and No. 197 on the pop chart.\n\n{{quote box|align=left|width=20em|quote=The good thing about Gamble and Huff is, nobody sounded alike, everybody had their own sound and that was the distinctive part that kept coming.|source=-Billy Paul<ref name=bluesandsoul.com />}}\n\n=====\"Me and Mrs. Jones\" and international fame=====\n\nWith each album, Gamble and Huff were moving closer to realizing the sound they envisioned for Billy Paul, and they achieved it with the 1972 album ''[[360 Degrees of Billy Paul]]'' and the single \"[[Me and Mrs. Jones]]\". Both the album and song received commercial and critical acclaim.\n\n\"Me and Mrs. Jones\" was a [[Hot 100 No. 1 Hits of 1972 (USA)|No. 1 hit]] for the last three weeks of 1972, selling two million copies (platinum single status), and went on to win Paul a [[Grammy Award for Best Male R&B Vocal Performance|Grammy Award]]. The [[Music recording sales certification|gold album]] and [[Music recording sales certification|platinum single]] broke the artist on world charts, including the United Kingdom, where the single entered the [[Top 40|Top 20]] of the [[UK Singles Chart]], reaching No. 12 in early 1973.<ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\">{{cite book| first= David | last= Roberts | year= 2006 | title= British Hit Singles & Albums | edition= 19th | publisher= Guinness World Records Limited | location= London | isbn= 1-904994-10-5 | page= 420}}</ref> In the years since then, the song has been covered numerous times, most notably by [[the Dramatics]] in 1974, [[Freddie Jackson]] in 1992 and [[Michael Bubl\u00e9]] in 2007. Paul recalled the Grammy win and the song's overall success: \"Oh man! I was up against [[Ray Charles]], I was up against [[Curtis Mayfield]], I was up against [[Isaac Hayes]]. I was in the Wilberforce University in Ohio, I had to go do a homecoming \u2013 my wife and her mother went. And when I see [[Ringo Starr]] call my name, I said Ohhh... Yeah...

In addition, the label was enjoying considerable success with their other artists, including [[the O'Jays]] and [[Harold Melvin & the Blue Notes]]. Paul remembered the atmosphere at the label: \"It was like a family full of music. It was like music round the clock, you know.\"<ref name=bluesandsoul.com />\n\n[[File:Clive Davis.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Music executive [[Clive Davis]] has consistently praised Paul's recording of \"[[Am I Black Enough for You?

(song)|Am I Black Enough for You?]]\" \u2013 failed to reach the heights of \"Mrs. Jones\", with the song's [[Black Power]] political message proving too much for mainstream radio's taste. There was and continues to be much controversy surrounding the choice to release this track as the follow-up to a cross-over smash hit.\n\nIn a 1977 interview, Paul made plain that he opposed the choice from the beginning: \n{{quote|I think though that a lot of mistakes were made at the time. The biggest one was releasing 'Am I Black Enough For You' straight after 'Mrs. Jones'. People weren't ready for that kind of a song after the pop success of 'Mrs. Jones'. They were looking for a sequel or at least something that wasn't provocative. You'll remember at the time that I told you I was 100% against it and history has proven me right. But though it was a company mistake, I'm still satisfied with both CBS and Philadelphia International.

I wanted \u2013 I'm gonna make it this time and come out. I think it's true to the audience, cos they look for something to come out compared to Mrs. Jones and that was [[Clive Davis]]' idea to do that. I think it was [[Kenny Gamble|Kenny]] and Clive Davis, but I think it was mostly Clive Davis.\"<ref name=bluesandsoul.com /> For his part, Davis has said that he opposed releasing the song as a single.<ref name=Azerrad /> Still, Davis called it an \"all time great record, all time great performance\".<ref name=bluesandsoul.com /> Gamble, the co-writer and producer of the track, said the song \"was great and Billy sounded great doing it\".<ref name=Azerrad /> Paul reflected: \"Well you know... For a long time I was angry about it, I had a bit of a letdown. Now the song is ahead of its time.<ref name=bluesandsoul.com /> I feel as though I let the song down when I went into my darkness. I feel like I abandoned the song.

Despite the disappointment over the chart performance of \"Am I Black Enough\", there was no reason to believe that he could not replicate the album's success or reach even greater heights. In May 1973, while still promoting ''360 Degrees of Billy Paul'', he was asked about a follow-up LP: \"I'm afraid that there will be something of a delay. As of right now, there are two sides actually completed. I have to tell you about one of them \u2014 [[Gamble and Huff|Kenny and Leon]] wrote it especially and it's a definite single at some point. It's called 'I Was Married' and I honestly think it will be bigger than 'Me and Mrs. Jones'. But for me, there are still two singles from the ''[[360 Degrees of Billy Paul|360 Degrees]]'' album \u2014 'Brown Baby' and 'I'm Just a Prisoner'. But, we are starting to work on the album more seriously from May 15.\" Despite Paul's enthusiasm, neither \"Brown Baby\" or \"I'm Just a Prisoner\" were released in U.S., although \"Brown Baby\" was issued in the UK but failed to chart.\n\n\"[[Me and Mrs. Jones]]\" was such a huge hit that Gamble and Huff decided to re-release Paul's first two albums, ''[[Feelin' Good at the Cadillac Club]]'' and ''[[Ebony Woman]]''. Reissued in 1973, both albums featured new cover art and were a boon to new fans hungry for Billy Paul product who had already purchased his first two [[Philadelphia International Records|PIR]] LPs. Still, neither reissue was terribly successful, with only ''Ebony Woman'' re-entering the album charts at No. 186 Pop and No. 43 Soul.\n\nPaul's next album, ''[[War of the Gods (album)|War of the Gods]]'', was the follow-up to ''360 Degrees of Billy Paul'' and was issued in November 1973. Unique in Paul's catalog, it contains lengthy [[psychedelic soul]], song suites and marked a conceptual and musical advance for Paul that did not go unrecognized by critics and fans. And while the LP and its singles enjoyed some success, Paul was unable to repeat the kind of wide impact he had with his previous album and \"Mrs. Jones\". The ''War of the Gods'' single \"Thanks for Saving My Life\", backed with \"I Was Married\" as the B-side, was a top-40 hit, reaching No. 37 on the pop chart and a top-10 soul record, reaching No. 9. It also reached No. 33 in the UK.\n\nPaul's 1973 European tour with [[the O'Jays]] and [[The Intruders (music group)|the Intruders]] spawned his first true live album: ''[[Live in Europe (Billy Paul album)|Live in Europe]]''. Recorded in London and released in 1974, it reached No. 10 on the ''Billboard'' Soul Album chart and No. 187 on the pop chart.\n\n''[[Got My Head on Straight]]'' was released in 1975 and was an attempt to return to the successful formula of ''360 Degrees of Billy Paul''. A collection of jazzy, soulful, funky, pop songs, it reached No. 140 on the ''Billboard'' Pop Album chart and No. 20 on the Soul chart. It included the singles \"Be Truthful to Me\" (No. 37 R&B); \"Billy's Back Home\" (No. 52 R&B); and \"July, July, July, July\", which did not chart. Despite the attempted return to form, the lack of mainstream success was a major disappointment to Paul, Gamble and Huff, and everyone at PIR.\n\n=====Jesse Jackson controversy=====\n\n[[File:THE REV.

It included the singles \"Let's Make a Baby\", which hit No. 83 on the Pop singles chart (the last record of Paul's to make that chart), No. 18 on the Soul chart and No. 30 in the UK, and \"People Power\", which reached No. 82 on the Soul chart and No. 14 on the U.S. Dance chart.\n\n{{quote box|align=left|width=29em|quote=Come on, come on, let's make a baby<br>\nOh, baby, come on, come on<br>\nLet's bring another life into this world<br>\nA little boy, a little girl<br>\nTake my hand while we walk slowly to the room<br>\nCan't you see tonight I'm gonna make sweet, sweet love to you?<br>\n....

Paul also had his usual success on the Soul charts, with the album hitting No. 27 and the singles \"How Good is Your Game,\" \"I Trust You,\" and \"[[Let 'Em In]]\" reaching Nos. 50, 79, and 91 respectively. Paul's version of the [[Elton John]] hit \"[[Your Song]]\" cracked the top 40 in the U.K., reaching No. 38.\n\n=====Final PIR recordings=====\n\nPaul released ''[[Only the Strong Survive (Billy Paul album)|Only the Strong Survive]]'' in 1977 and it proved to be his final charting album, reaching No. 152 on the Pop chart and No. 36 Soul. The LP's title track was the first single, reaching No. 68 on the Soul chart and No. 33 in the UK. The next time Paul's voice would be heard during the summer of 1977 was on the track \"Let's Clean Up the Ghetto\", featuring the \"Philadelphia International All-Stars\": Billy Paul, [[Lou Rawls]], [[Archie Bell (singer)|Archie Bell]], [[Teddy Pendergrass]], [[Dee Dee Sharp]] Gamble, and [[Eddie Levert]] and Walter Williams of [[The O'Jays]]. The song reached No. 91 on the Pop chart and No. 4 on the Soul chart. The ''Let's Clean Up the Ghetto'' album also included the Billy Paul tracks (both written by [[Gamble & Huff]]) \"New Day\" and \"New World Comin'\". All proceeds from the album and single went toward a program to benefit inner-cities throughout the U.S. Paul followed up the success of both his \"Only the Strong Survive\" single and \"Let's Clean Up the Ghetto\" with \"Sooner or Later\" \u2013 another track from his latest LP. Yet the track failed to chart as did \"Don't Give Up on Us\" and \"Everybody's Breaking Up\", which was officially released in the U.K. but only issued to radio in the U.S.\n\nPaul's final studio album for [[Philadelphia International Records|Philadelphia International]] was ''[[First Class (Billy Paul album)|First Class]]'', released in 1979. It was the first album since his 1968 debut ''[[Feelin' Good at the Cadillac Club]]'' that did not make either the Pop or Soul charts. The LP's first single \"Bring the Family Back\" failed to chart but a 12\" [[disco]] version did reach No. 90 on the Soul chart and No. 51 on the Dance chart. \"False Faces\" was also released in both single and 12\" [[disco]] versions but neither charted.\n\nPaul's run at Philadelphia International officially ended with the 1980 release ''[[Best of Billy Paul]]''. This double-album compilation included four previously unreleased tracks: \"You're My Sweetness,\" \"Next to Nature,\" \"What Are We Going to Do Now That He's Back,\" and \"My Old Flame.\" The UK version was a single LP titled ''Billy Paul's Greatest Hits'' with a different track listing and only one of the \"new\" songs: \"You're My Sweetness\". That song was released as a single and reached No. 69 on the Soul chart. Paul's final single for Philadelphia International was an edited version of a song from his first Philadelphia International album ''[[Going East]]'': \"Jesus Boy (You Only Look Like a Man)\", which failed to chart.\n\nNumerous \"best of\" compilations of Paul's Philadelphia International work have been released over the years, though critics have made plain that most have failed to capture the right balance of singles and album tracks to fully represent the depth and breadth of his PIR output. For example, [[AllMusic]]'s Andrew Hamilton said of the 2002 collection ''Super Hits'': \"If you didn't live and die with Billy Paul's albums when he cranked them out on Philadelphia International Records, you won't have a clue as to what his fans want to hear. To compile a CD from Paul's singles is to compile a mediocre collection; you have to supplement the singles with choice LP cuts. And with a brief ten-track collection like this, some of the singles should have been replaced with a few of Paul's icy album joints.\"<ref>{{Allmusic |class=album |id=collection-mw0000218003 |tab=review |label=''Collection'' Review |first=Andrew |last=Hamilton |accessdate=June 28, 2015}}</ref> By contrast, Jason Ankeny said that the 1999 compilation ''Me & Mrs. Jones: Best of Billy Paul'' \"goes far beyond the classic title track in restoring the singer to prominence, showcasing his versatility via superb covers of pop favorites.... [and] the inclusion of R&B chart hits.... it all adds up to a definitive portrait of Paul in his prime.\"<ref name=Ankeny>{{Allmusic |class=album |id=me-and-mrs-jones-the-best-of-billy-paul-mw0000237796 |tab=review |label=''Me and Mrs. Jones: The Best of Billy Paul'' Review |first=Jason |last=Ankeny |accessdate=June 18, 2015}}</ref>\n\nPaul was on the Philadelphia International label, in all, for nine years and while he enjoyed considerable success \u2013 especially with \"Me and Mrs. Jones\" \u2013 critics generally agree that he deserved better. Andrew Hamilton put it bluntly: \"Gamble and Huff did a horrible job picking Paul's singles. Some better choices, and his career might have been Hall-of-Famish.\"<ref>{{Allmusic |class=album |id=greatest-hits-mw0000845389 |tab=review |label=''Greatest Hits'' Review |first=Andrew |last=Hamilton |accessdate=June 18, 2015}}</ref> Similarly, Jason Ankeny wrote: \"Too easily dismissed as little more than a one-hit wonder, Billy Paul was, in fact, one of the most gifted and affecting talents to grace the Philadelphia International stable \u2013 the recipient of some of the Gamble and Huff team's most lush and sophisticated productions. His deeply soulful voice bridged the gap between jazz and soul, textured in equal measure by street-smart swagger and touching vulnerability.\"<ref name=Ankeny />\n\n===Post-PIR studio recordings===\n\nPaul made two studio albums in the 1980s. The first, ''Lately'', was released in 1985 and was a dramatic musical departure from the lush [[Philadelphia Soul]] of his previous efforts. Recorded for [[Lonnie Simmons]]' [[Total Experience Records]], the album's synthesizer and keyboard-driven tracks (typical of music production at the time) were closer to Simmons' work with [[the Gap Band]] and [[Yarbrough and Peoples]] than they were to Paul's '70s orchestrated wall of sound. The album's title track, a ballad, was released as a single in the U.K. but did not chart. The follow-up single \u2013 a slow jam called \"Sexual Therapy\" \u2013 fared better, climbing to No. 80 on the U.K. charts.\n\nPaul's final studio album was 1988's ''Wide Open'' for the [[Ichiban Records|Ichiban]] label. Similar in production style to his previous release, though perhaps a bit smoother, it reached No. 61 on the Soul chart. However, the singles \"We Could Have Been\" and \"I Just Love You So Much\" failed to chart.\n\n===\"Retirement\" years===\n\nPaul announced his retirement in 1989 on stage in London.<ref>{{cite news| first=Paul |last=Connolly |title=Critic's Rock |work=The Times|location=London | date=January 3, 2004 }}</ref> But like so many artists before him, he could not resist the temptation to continue to play live shows and record.

Asked in 2012 whether playing in Philadelphia held special meaning to him, he said: \"I try to feel comfortable wherever I play, but they call it being a native son and I do get a lot of respect there so it is special. The reaction internationally is great as well, so even in Paris or Brazil we have great audiences. Songs like [[Me and Mrs. Jones|Mrs. Jones]] are huge everywhere so I do perform a lot overseas.\"<ref name=\"movievortex.com\" />\n\nIn 2000 he released a CD \u2013 ''Live World Tour 1999\u20132000'' \u2013 on his own label, ''PhillySounds''. Recorded in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil; Paris, France; Bermuda, and Philadelphia, it contained the following tracks: \"Billy's Back Home,\" \"Love Buddies,\" \"When Love is New,\" \"This is Your Life,\" \"Thanks for Saving My Life,\" \"Let's Get It On/What's Going On,\" \"War of the Gods,\" \"I Believe I Can Fly,\" \"Your Song,\" \"Without You,\" and \"Mr & Mrs. Jones.\" Two years later, a complete show from that tour was released outside the U.S. on the PID label. Titled ''Your Songs: Live in Paris'', it was recorded in December 2000 at a private event for the RFM TV Channel at Studio 287 in Paris, France. It includes the songs \"July, July, July, July\", \"Only the Strong Survive\", \"[[It's Too Late (Carole King song)|It's Too Late]]\", \"Brown Baby\", \"Let 'Em In\", \"It's Critical\", \"False Faces\", and \"Let's Clean Up the Ghetto\", among others.<ref>{{Allmusic |class=album |id=your-songs-mw0000743353 |tab=review |label=''Your Songs'' Review |accessdate=June 18, 2015}}</ref>\n\n{{quote box|align=left|width=30em|quote=I\u2019ve always worked hard to create my own style.

In 2011, a film based on Lewis' book also called ''[[Moneyball (film)|Moneyball]]'' was released to further provide insight into the techniques used in the Oakland Athletics' front office.\n\n== Traditional measurements ==\nSabermetrics was created in an attempt for baseball fans to learn about the sport through objective evidence.  This is performed by evaluating players in every aspect of the game, specifically batting, pitching, and fielding.  These evaluation measures are usually phrased in terms of either runs or team wins as older statistics were deemed ineffective.\n\n=== Batting measurements ===\nThe traditional measure of batting performance is considered to be hits divided by the total number of at-bats. Bill James, along with other fathers of sabermetrics, found this measure to be flawed, as it ignores any other way a batter can reach base besides a hit.<ref name=\":12\">{{Cite book|last=Albert|first=Jim|url=|title=Mathematics and Sports|publisher=MAA|others=Contributor : Mathematical Association of America|year=2010|isbn=9780883853498|editor-last=Joseph A.

To calculate the On-Base percentage, the total number of hits + bases on balls + hit by pitch are divided by at bats + bases on balls + hit by pitch + sacrifice flies.<ref name=\":8\"/>{{rp|11}}\n\nAnother issue with the traditional measure of the batting average is that it does not distinguish between hits (i.e., singles, doubles, triples, and home runs) and gives each hit equal value.<ref name=\":12\" />  Thus, a measure that differentiates between these four hit outcomes, the [[slugging percentage]], was created. To calculate the slugging percentage, the total number of bases of all hits is divided by the total numbers of time at bat.  [[Stephen Jay Gould]] proposed that the disappearance of .400 batting average is actually a sign of general improvement in batting.<ref name=\":2\">{{cite book|title=Triumph and Tragedy in Mudville: A Lifelong Passion for Baseball|last=Gould|first=Stephen Jay|date=2003|publisher=W.

[[On-base plus slugging]] is the sum of the on-base percentage and the slugging percentage.  This modern statistic has become useful in comparing players and is a powerful method of predicting runs scored from a certain player.<ref name=\":022\">{{cite web|url=http://baseball1.com/baseball-archive/sabermetrics/sabermetric-manifesto/|title=The Sabermetric Manifesto|last=Grabiner|first=David J.|work=The Baseball Archive}}</ref>\n\nSome of the other statistics that sabermetricians use to evaluate batting performance are [[weighted on-base average]], [[secondary average]], [[runs created]], and [[equivalent average]].\n\n=== Pitching measurements ===\nThe traditional measure of pitching performance is considered to be the earned run average. It is calculated by dividing the number of [[earned run]]s allowed by the number of innings pitched and multiplying by nine because of the nine innings.  This statistic provides the number of runs that a pitcher allows per game.  It has proven to be flawed as it does not separate the ability of the pitcher from the abilities of the fielders that he plays with.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.baseballprospectus.com/article.php?articleid=878|title=Pitching and Defense: How Much Control Do Hurlers Have?|last=McCracken|first=Voros|date=January 23, 2001|website=Baseball Prospectus|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref> Another classic measure for pitching is a pitcher's [[winning percentage]]. Winning percentage is calculated by dividing wins by the number of decisions (wins plus losses). This statistic can also be flawed as it is dependent on the pitcher's teammates' performances at the plate and in the field.\n\nSabermetricians have attempted to find different measures of pitching performance that does not include the performances of the fielders involved.  One of the earliest developed, and one of the most popular in use, is [[walks plus hits per inning pitched]] (WHIP), which while not completely defense-independent, tends to indicate how many times a pitcher is likely to put a player on base (either by base-on-balls, hit-by-pitch, or base hit) and thus how effective batters are against a particular pitcher in reaching base.  A more recent development is the creation of [[defense independent pitching statistics]] (DIPS) system.  [[Voros McCracken]] has been credited with the development of this system in 1999.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Basco|first=Dan|last2=Davies|first2=Michael|date=Fall 2010|title=The Many Flavors of DIPS: A History and an Overview|url=|journal=Baseball Research Journal|volume=32|issue=2|pages=|via=}}</ref>  Through his research, McCracken was able to show that there is little to no difference between pitchers in the number of hits they allow, regardless of their skill level.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.beyondtheboxscore.com/2014/1/17/5309808/how-has-sabermetrics-changed-baseball|title=How has sabermetrics changes baseball?|last=Ball|first=Andrew|date=January 17, 2014|website=Beyond the Box Score|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref>   Some examples of these statistics are [[Defense-Independent ERA|defense-independent ERA]], fielding independent pitching, and [[Defense-Independent Component ERA|defense-independent component ERA]].  Other sabermetricians have furthered the work in DIPS, such as [[Tom Tango]] who runs the ''Tango on Baseball'' sabermetrics website.\n\n''[[Baseball Prospectus]]'' created another statistics called the [[peripheral ERA]].  This measure of a pitcher's performance takes hits, walks, home runs allowed, and strikeouts while adjusting for ballpark factors.<ref name=\":5\" />  Each ballpark has different dimensions when it comes to the outfield wall so a pitcher should not be measured the same for each of these parks.<ref name=\":62\">{{Cite book|title=The Sabermetric Revolution: Assessing the Growth of Analytics in Baseball|last=Baumer|first=Benjamin|last2=Zimbalist|first2=Andrew|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|authorlink=Ben Baumer}}</ref>\n\n[[Batting average on balls in play]] (BABIP) is another useful measurement for determining pitcher's performance.<ref name=\":4\" />  When a pitcher has a high BABIP, they will often show improvements in the following season, while a pitcher with low BABIP will often show a decline in the following season.<ref name=\":4\" /> This is based on the statistical concept of [[regression to the mean]]. Others have created various means of attempting to [[Pitch quantification|quantify individual pitches]] based on characteristics of the pitch, as opposed to runs earned or balls hit.\n\n== Higher mathematics ==\n[[Value over replacement player]] (VORP) is considered a popular sabermetric statistic. This statistic demonstrates how much a player contributes to his team in comparison to a fake replacement player that performs below average. This measurement was founded by Keith Woolner, a former writer for the sabermetric group/website ''Baseball Prospectus''.\n\n[[Wins Above Replacement|Wins above replacement]] (WAR) is another popular sabermetric statistic that will evaluate a player's contributions to his team.<ref>[[Wins Above Replacement#FG-WAR|Fangraphs]]: WAR</ref>   Similar to VORP, WAR compares a certain player to a replacement-level player in order to determine the number of additional wins the player has provided to his team.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/blog/sweetspot/post/_/id/27050/what-we-talk-about-when-we-talk-about-war|title=What we talk about when we talk about WAR|last=Schoenfield|first=David|date=July 19, 2012|website=ESPN.com|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref>  WAR values vary with hitting positions and are largely determined by a player's successful performance and their amount of playing time.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n=== Quantitative analysis in baseball ===\nMany traditional and modern statistics, such as ERA and Wins Shared, don't give a full understanding of what is taking place on the field.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite book|last=John T. Saccoman|title=Practicing Sabermetrics: Putting the Science of Baseball Statistics to Work|last2=Gabriel R. Costa|last3=Michael R.

Structured quantitative analysis is capable of explaining many aspects of the game, for example, to examine how often a team should attempt to [[Stolen base|steal]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.fangraphs.com/blogs/the-changing-caught-stealing-calculus-2/|title=The Changing Caught-Stealing Calculus {{!}} FanGraphs Baseball|newspaper=FanGraphs Baseball|language=en-us|access-date=2016-12-06}}</ref>\n\n==== Related rates in baseball ====\n[[Related rates]] can be used in baseball to give exact calculations of different plays in a game. For example, if a runner is being sent home from third, related rates can be used to show if a throw from the outfield would have been on time or if it was correctly cut off before the plate.<ref name=\":8\" />{{rp|189\u2013198}} Related rates also can aid in determining how fast a player can get around the bases after a batted ball, information that helps in the development of scouting reports and individual player development.\n\n==== Momentum and force ====\nMomentum and force is a similar application of calculus in baseball. Particularly, the average force on a bat while hitting a ball can be calculated by combining different concepts within applied calculus. First, the change in the ball's [[momentum]] by the external force F(t) must be calculated. The momentum can be found by multiplying the mass and velocity. The external force F(t) is a continuous function of time.\n\n== Applications ==\nSabermetrics can be used for multiple purposes, but the most common are evaluating past performance and predicting future performance to determine a player's contributions to his team.<ref name=\":022\" /> These may be useful when determining who should win end-of-the-season awards such as MVP and when determining the value of making a certain trade.\n\nMost baseball players tend to play a few years in the minor leagues before they are called up to the major league. The competitive differences coupled with ballpark effects make the exact comparison of a player's statistics a problem. Sabermetricians have been able to clear this problem by adjusting the player's minor league statistics, also known as the Minor-League Equivalency.<ref name=\":022\" /> Through these adjustments, teams are able to look at a player's performance in both AA and AAA to determine if he is fit to be called up to the majors.\n\n=== Applied statistics ===\nSabermetrics methods are generally used for three purposes:\n\n# To compare key performances among certain specific players under realistic data conditions. The evaluation of past performance of a player enables an analytic overview. The comparison of this data between players can help one understand key points such as their market values. In that way, the role and the salary that should be given to that player can be defined.\n# To provide prediction of future performance of a given player or a team. When past data is available about the performance of a team or a specific player, Sabermetrics can be used to predict the average future performances for the next season. Thus, a prediction can be made with a certain probability about the number of wins and losses.\n# To provide a useful function of the player's contributions to his team. When analyzing data, one is able to understand the contributions a player makes to the success/failure of his team. Given that correlation, we can sign or release players with certain characteristics.\n\n=== Machine learning for predicting game outcome ===\nA [[machine learning]] model can be built using data sets available at sources such as baseball-reference. This model will give probability estimates for the outcome of specific games or the performance of particular players. These estimates are increasingly accurate when applied to a large number of events over a long term. The game outcome (win/lose) is treated as having a binomial distribution.\n\nPredictions can be made using a logistic regression model with explanatory variables including: opponents' runs scored, runs scored, shutouts time at bat, winning rate, and pitcher whip.\n\n== Recent advances ==\nMany sabermetricians are still working hard to contribute to the field through creating new measures and asking new questions.  Bill James' two ''[[The Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract|Historical Baseball Abstract]]'' editions and ''[[Win shares|Win Shares]]'' book have continued to advance the field of sabermetrics, 25 years after he helped start the movement.<ref name=\"james2\">{{cite web|url=http://static.espn.go.com/mlb/s/2002/1105/1456563.html|title=Red Sox hire James in advisory capacity|last=Neyer|first=Rob|date=November 5, 2002|accessdate=March 7, 2009|work=[[ESPN.com]]}}</ref>  His former assistant [[Rob Neyer]], who is now a senior writer at ESPN.com and national baseball editor of SBNation, also worked on popularizing sabermetrics since the mid-1980s.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hardballtimes.com/main/article/rob-neyer-interview/|title=Rob Neyer Interview|last=Jaffe|first=C.|date=October 22, 2007|work=[[The Hardball Times]]|accessdate=November 2, 2007}}</ref>\n\n[[Nate Silver]], a former writer and managing partner of ''Baseball Prospectus'', invented [[PECOTA]].

To calculate the On-Base percentage, the total number of hits + bases on balls + hit by pitch are divided by at bats + bases on balls + hit by pitch + sacrifice flies.<ref name=\":8\"/>{{rp|11}}\n\nAnother issue with the traditional measure of the batting average is that it does not distinguish between hits (i.e., singles, doubles, triples, and home runs) and gives each hit equal value.<ref name=\":12\" />  Thus, a measure that differentiates between these four hit outcomes, the [[slugging percentage]], was created. To calculate the slugging percentage, the total number of bases of all hits is divided by the total numbers of time at bat.  [[Stephen Jay Gould]] proposed that the disappearance of .400 batting average is actually a sign of general improvement in batting.<ref name=\":2\">{{cite book|title=Triumph and Tragedy in Mudville: A Lifelong Passion for Baseball|last=Gould|first=Stephen Jay|date=2003|publisher=W.

The discussion revolved around an essay that Gould wrote for ''Discover'' magazine in 1986 and that was reprinted both in his 1996 book ''Full House'' and in ''Triumph and Tragedy'' under the title \"Why No One Hits .400 Anymore\" ...}}</ref>   This is because, in the modern era, players are becoming more focused on hitting for power than for average.<ref name=\":3\" />  Therefore, it has become more valuable to compare players using the slugging percentage and on-base percentage over the batting average.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nThese two improved sabermetric measures are important skills to measure in a batter and have been combined to create the modern statistic OPS.  [[On-base plus slugging]] is the sum of the on-base percentage and the slugging percentage.  This modern statistic has become useful in comparing players and is a powerful method of predicting runs scored from a certain player.<ref name=\":022\">{{cite web|url=http://baseball1.com/baseball-archive/sabermetrics/sabermetric-manifesto/|title=The Sabermetric Manifesto|last=Grabiner|first=David J.|work=The Baseball Archive}}</ref>\n\nSome of the other statistics that sabermetricians use to evaluate batting performance are [[weighted on-base average]], [[secondary average]], [[runs created]], and [[equivalent average]].\n\n=== Pitching measurements ===\nThe traditional measure of pitching performance is considered to be the earned run average. It is calculated by dividing the number of [[earned run]]s allowed by the number of innings pitched and multiplying by nine because of the nine innings.  This statistic provides the number of runs that a pitcher allows per game.  It has proven to be flawed as it does not separate the ability of the pitcher from the abilities of the fielders that he plays with.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.baseballprospectus.com/article.php?articleid=878|title=Pitching and Defense: How Much Control Do Hurlers Have?|last=McCracken|first=Voros|date=January 23, 2001|website=Baseball Prospectus|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref> Another classic measure for pitching is a pitcher's [[winning percentage]]. Winning percentage is calculated by dividing wins by the number of decisions (wins plus losses). This statistic can also be flawed as it is dependent on the pitcher's teammates' performances at the plate and in the field.\n\nSabermetricians have attempted to find different measures of pitching performance that does not include the performances of the fielders involved.  One of the earliest developed, and one of the most popular in use, is [[walks plus hits per inning pitched]] (WHIP), which while not completely defense-independent, tends to indicate how many times a pitcher is likely to put a player on base (either by base-on-balls, hit-by-pitch, or base hit) and thus how effective batters are against a particular pitcher in reaching base.  A more recent development is the creation of [[defense independent pitching statistics]] (DIPS) system.  [[Voros McCracken]] has been credited with the development of this system in 1999.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Basco|first=Dan|last2=Davies|first2=Michael|date=Fall 2010|title=The Many Flavors of DIPS: A History and an Overview|url=|journal=Baseball Research Journal|volume=32|issue=2|pages=|via=}}</ref>  Through his research, McCracken was able to show that there is little to no difference between pitchers in the number of hits they allow, regardless of their skill level.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.beyondtheboxscore.com/2014/1/17/5309808/how-has-sabermetrics-changed-baseball|title=How has sabermetrics changes baseball?|last=Ball|first=Andrew|date=January 17, 2014|website=Beyond the Box Score|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref>   Some examples of these statistics are [[Defense-Independent ERA|defense-independent ERA]], fielding independent pitching, and [[Defense-Independent Component ERA|defense-independent component ERA]].  Other sabermetricians have furthered the work in DIPS, such as [[Tom Tango]] who runs the ''Tango on Baseball'' sabermetrics website.\n\n''[[Baseball Prospectus]]'' created another statistics called the [[peripheral ERA]].  This measure of a pitcher's performance takes hits, walks, home runs allowed, and strikeouts while adjusting for ballpark factors.<ref name=\":5\" />  Each ballpark has different dimensions when it comes to the outfield wall so a pitcher should not be measured the same for each of these parks.<ref name=\":62\">{{Cite book|title=The Sabermetric Revolution: Assessing the Growth of Analytics in Baseball|last=Baumer|first=Benjamin|last2=Zimbalist|first2=Andrew|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|authorlink=Ben Baumer}}</ref>\n\n[[Batting average on balls in play]] (BABIP) is another useful measurement for determining pitcher's performance.<ref name=\":4\" />  When a pitcher has a high BABIP, they will often show improvements in the following season, while a pitcher with low BABIP will often show a decline in the following season.<ref name=\":4\" /> This is based on the statistical concept of [[regression to the mean]]. Others have created various means of attempting to [[Pitch quantification|quantify individual pitches]] based on characteristics of the pitch, as opposed to runs earned or balls hit.\n\n== Higher mathematics ==\n[[Value over replacement player]] (VORP) is considered a popular sabermetric statistic. This statistic demonstrates how much a player contributes to his team in comparison to a fake replacement player that performs below average. This measurement was founded by Keith Woolner, a former writer for the sabermetric group/website ''Baseball Prospectus''.\n\n[[Wins Above Replacement|Wins above replacement]] (WAR) is another popular sabermetric statistic that will evaluate a player's contributions to his team.<ref>[[Wins Above Replacement#FG-WAR|Fangraphs]]: WAR</ref>   Similar to VORP, WAR compares a certain player to a replacement-level player in order to determine the number of additional wins the player has provided to his team.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/blog/sweetspot/post/_/id/27050/what-we-talk-about-when-we-talk-about-war|title=What we talk about when we talk about WAR|last=Schoenfield|first=David|date=July 19, 2012|website=ESPN.com|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref>  WAR values vary with hitting positions and are largely determined by a player's successful performance and their amount of playing time.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n=== Quantitative analysis in baseball ===\nMany traditional and modern statistics, such as ERA and Wins Shared, don't give a full understanding of what is taking place on the field.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite book|last=John T. Saccoman|title=Practicing Sabermetrics: Putting the Science of Baseball Statistics to Work|last2=Gabriel R. Costa|last3=Michael R. Huber|publisher=McFarland & Company|year=2009|isbn=978-0-7864-4177-8|location=United States of America }}</ref>{{rp|189\u2013198}} Simple ratios are not sufficient to understand the statistical data of baseball. Structured quantitative analysis is capable of explaining many aspects of the game, for example, to examine how often a team should attempt to [[Stolen base|steal]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.fangraphs.com/blogs/the-changing-caught-stealing-calculus-2/|title=The Changing Caught-Stealing Calculus {{!}} FanGraphs Baseball|newspaper=FanGraphs Baseball|language=en-us|access-date=2016-12-06}}</ref>\n\n==== Related rates in baseball ====\n[[Related rates]] can be used in baseball to give exact calculations of different plays in a game. For example, if a runner is being sent home from third, related rates can be used to show if a throw from the outfield would have been on time or if it was correctly cut off before the plate.<ref name=\":8\" />{{rp|189\u2013198}} Related rates also can aid in determining how fast a player can get around the bases after a batted ball, information that helps in the development of scouting reports and individual player development.\n\n==== Momentum and force ====\nMomentum and force is a similar application of calculus in baseball. Particularly, the average force on a bat while hitting a ball can be calculated by combining different concepts within applied calculus. First, the change in the ball's [[momentum]] by the external force F(t) must be calculated. The momentum can be found by multiplying the mass and velocity. The external force F(t) is a continuous function of time.\n\n== Applications ==\nSabermetrics can be used for multiple purposes, but the most common are evaluating past performance and predicting future performance to determine a player's contributions to his team.<ref name=\":022\" /> These may be useful when determining who should win end-of-the-season awards such as MVP and when determining the value of making a certain trade.\n\nMost baseball players tend to play a few years in the minor leagues before they are called up to the major league. The competitive differences coupled with ballpark effects make the exact comparison of a player's statistics a problem. Sabermetricians have been able to clear this problem by adjusting the player's minor league statistics, also known as the Minor-League Equivalency.<ref name=\":022\" /> Through these adjustments, teams are able to look at a player's performance in both AA and AAA to determine if he is fit to be called up to the majors.\n\n=== Applied statistics ===\nSabermetrics methods are generally used for three purposes:\n\n# To compare key performances among certain specific players under realistic data conditions. The evaluation of past performance of a player enables an analytic overview. The comparison of this data between players can help one understand key points such as their market values. In that way, the role and the salary that should be given to that player can be defined.\n# To provide prediction of future performance of a given player or a team. When past data is available about the performance of a team or a specific player, Sabermetrics can be used to predict the average future performances for the next season. Thus, a prediction can be made with a certain probability about the number of wins and losses.\n# To provide a useful function of the player's contributions to his team. When analyzing data, one is able to understand the contributions a player makes to the success/failure of his team. Given that correlation, we can sign or release players with certain characteristics.\n\n=== Machine learning for predicting game outcome ===\nA [[machine learning]] model can be built using data sets available at sources such as baseball-reference. This model will give probability estimates for the outcome of specific games or the performance of particular players. These estimates are increasingly accurate when applied to a large number of events over a long term. The game outcome (win/lose) is treated as having a binomial distribution.\n\nPredictions can be made using a logistic regression model with explanatory variables including: opponents' runs scored, runs scored, shutouts time at bat, winning rate, and pitcher whip.\n\n== Recent advances ==\nMany sabermetricians are still working hard to contribute to the field through creating new measures and asking new questions.  Bill James' two ''[[The Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract|Historical Baseball Abstract]]'' editions and ''[[Win shares|Win Shares]]'' book have continued to advance the field of sabermetrics, 25 years after he helped start the movement.<ref name=\"james2\">{{cite web|url=http://static.espn.go.com/mlb/s/2002/1105/1456563.html|title=Red Sox hire James in advisory capacity|last=Neyer|first=Rob|date=November 5, 2002|accessdate=March 7, 2009|work=[[ESPN.com]]}}</ref>  His former assistant [[Rob Neyer]], who is now a senior writer at ESPN.com and national baseball editor of SBNation, also worked on popularizing sabermetrics since the mid-1980s.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hardballtimes.com/main/article/rob-neyer-interview/|title=Rob Neyer Interview|last=Jaffe|first=C.|date=October 22, 2007|work=[[The Hardball Times]]|accessdate=November 2, 2007}}</ref>\n\n[[Nate Silver]], a former writer and managing partner of ''Baseball Prospectus'', invented [[PECOTA]].

It is part of a group of software-compatible consoles which include the [[VC 4000|Interton VC-4000]] and the [[Voltmace Database]]. The 1292 Advanced Programmable Video System included its power pack inside the console instead of an exterior power pack.\n\n==Specifications==\n[[Image:Acetronic-Mpu-1000-pcb.jpg|300px|thumb|right|PCB Scan of the Acetronic MPU-1000.]]\n\n* [[CPU]]: [[8-bit]] [[Signetics 2650]]AI at 4.43&nbsp;MHz\n* Audiovisual co-processor (video chipset, I/O Processor): [[Signetics 2636]]N at 3.58&nbsp;MHz, addressing 32 kB of memory in 8 kB banks. This chipset was less powerful than the later model Signetics 2637N used in the [[Arcadia 2001]].\n* Data [[Memory (computers)|Memory]]: 43 bytes\n\n===Graphics===\n* [[Sprite (computer graphics)|Sprites]]: 4 single colour sprites (1 can be 8 colours)\n* 1 score line displaying 4 [[Binary-coded decimal|BCD]] digits\n* Background consisting of a series of alternating lines\n\n===Misc===\n* The early games cartridges used a 2 KByte ROM, later ones, such as Activision branded ones, up to 8 KBytes\n* Very basic arcade machine sound\n\n===User programming===\n\nAn expensive (\u00a349 in the UK in 1977) Hobby Module was available which gave 6.5 kb of user-programmable memory and had a 5 pin DIN socket to allow software to be saved to a cassette tape player. This converted the unit into a halfway house between a home computer and an ordinary gaming console.\n\nThe user had to be familiar with programming in Signetics 2650 assembly language and the unconventional ways and register architecture of the Signetics 2650 processor. For example, on many other processors an opcode 0 indicates \"no operation\" whereas on the 2650 it instructs the processor to Branch To Address In Immediate Register B. This was a source of many software debugging hassles for budding home programmers.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\n==Released versions==\nThe console was produced by different companies and sold with different names. Not every console is compatible with others due to differences in the shapes and dimensions of the cartridge slots (but all of the consoles are software compatible).\nHere's a table of the consoles grouped by compatibility family (due to the slots).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

It is part of a group of software-compatible consoles which include the [[VC 4000|Interton VC-4000]] and the [[Voltmace Database]]. The 1292 Advanced Programmable Video System included its power pack inside the console instead of an exterior power pack.\n\n==Specifications==\n[[Image:Acetronic-Mpu-1000-pcb.jpg|300px|thumb|right|PCB Scan of the Acetronic MPU-1000.]]\n\n* [[CPU]]: [[8-bit]] [[Signetics 2650]]AI at 4.43&nbsp;MHz\n* Audiovisual co-processor (video chipset, I/O Processor): [[Signetics 2636]]N at 3.58&nbsp;MHz, addressing 32 kB of memory in 8 kB banks. This chipset was less powerful than the later model Signetics 2637N used in the [[Arcadia 2001]].\n* Data [[Memory (computers)|Memory]]: 43 bytes\n\n===Graphics===\n* [[Sprite (computer graphics)|Sprites]]: 4 single colour sprites (1 can be 8 colours)\n* 1 score line displaying 4 [[Binary-coded decimal|BCD]] digits\n* Background consisting of a series of alternating lines\n\n===Misc===\n* The early games cartridges used a 2 KByte ROM, later ones, such as Activision branded ones, up to 8 KBytes\n* Very basic arcade machine sound\n\n===User programming===\n\nAn expensive (\u00a349 in the UK in 1977) Hobby Module was available which gave 6.5 kb of user-programmable memory and had a 5 pin DIN socket to allow software to be saved to a cassette tape player. This converted the unit into a halfway house between a home computer and an ordinary gaming console.\n\nThe user had to be familiar with programming in Signetics 2650 assembly language and the unconventional ways and register architecture of the Signetics 2650 processor. For example, on many other processors an opcode 0 indicates \"no operation\" whereas on the 2650 it instructs the processor to Branch To Address In Immediate Register B. This was a source of many software debugging hassles for budding home programmers.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\n==Released versions==\nThe console was produced by different companies and sold with different names. Not every console is compatible with others due to differences in the shapes and dimensions of the cartridge slots (but all of the consoles are software compatible).\nHere's a table of the consoles grouped by compatibility family (due to the slots).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

It was released as on [[contemporary hit radio]] on May 23 2000, after an [[Mastering (audio)|unmastered]] version was leaked. \"Doesn't Really Matter\" is a [[Pop music|pop]], [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] and [[Dance music|dance]] song that speaks about loving a person for who they are and disregarding their physical appearance. The track is based on an incomplete poem Jackson had written, which was later applied to her character in the film. The song was a contrast from the dark tone of her previous album ''[[The Velvet Rope]]'', returning to a brighter and more contemporary sound.\n\nThe song generally received positive reception, becoming Jackson's ninth number-one single in the United States after peaking on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] for three weeks. It was Jackson's 19th single to be [[Music recording certification|certified]] gold and the 13th best-selling single in 2000, selling over 600,000 copies in sales. It reached number five in the United Kingdom, where it attained a silver certification. The song peaked within the top 10 in Canada, Denmark, Poland, Italy, and Spain, as well as in the top 20 in Belgium, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland.\n\nThe [[music video]], directed by [[Joseph Kahn]], resembles an [[abstract art|abstract]], futuristic environment based on Japanese culture. In addition to scenes from the film, it also features futuristic technology, morphing clothes, and a dance sequence on a levitating platform. It had a reported cost of over $2.5 million (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|2.5|2000|r=1}}&nbsp;million in {{Inflation/year|US}}), causing it to become one of the [[List of most expensive music videos|most expensive music videos]] of all time. [[Jenna Dewan]] made one of her earliest appearances in the video, performing as a dancer. She was later personally offered by Jackson to appear in the music video for \"[[All for You (Janet Jackson song)|All for You]]\", and perform as a dancer on the [[All for You Tour]].\n\n==Background and development==\n\"Doesn't Really Matter\" was written and produced by [[Janet Jackson]], [[Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis]] as the theme for the [[Universal Pictures]] film ''[[Nutty Professor II: The Klumps]]'', starring Jackson and actor [[Eddie Murphy]].<ref name=\"LinerNotes\">{{Cite AV media notes|title=Doesn't Really Matter|others=[[Janet Jackson]]|year=2000|type=booklet|publisher=[[Def Jam Records]]|id=562 916-2|location=New York City}}</ref> She portrays Professor Denise Gaines in the film, the love interest of [[The Nutty Professor (character)|Sherman Klump]], who is one of many characters portrayed by Murphy.<ref name=\"KlumpsMTV\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1428172/20000523/dmx.jhtml|title=LL, Sisqo, Jay-Z, Foxy, DMX, More For \"Klumps\"|website=[[MTV News]]|date=May 23, 2000|access-date=December 10, 2019}}</ref> When asked to contribute a single for the [[Nutty Professor II: The Klumps (soundtrack)|movie's soundtrack]], Jackson stated that she would consider if she found an appropriate song.<ref name=\"Bronson\">{{cite book|last=Bronson|first=Fred|year=2003|title=Billboard's Hottest Hot 100 Hits|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard Books]]|edition=3|page=902|isbn=0823077381}}</ref> The single would allow Jackson to continue releasing music, while simultaneously devoting time to her film career.<ref>{{cite book|date=July 21\u201323, 2000|title=Action Jackson|work=[[USA Weekend]]|page=6}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|date=November 2000|title=Janet at the Crossroads|work=[[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]]|page=181}}</ref> To help inspire Jackson, director [[Peter Segal]] brought a rough cut of the film to Flyte Tyme Studios where the singer was recording her seventh album, ''[[All for You (Janet Jackson album)|All for You]]''.

Jackson then grabs a beverage from her fridge and starts singing in front of a mirror containing visually animated animal stickers. Four of her friends knock at her door and Jackson leaves with them. They dance through the apartment block hallway as their shoes morph into black futuristic high-heels, walking into an area filled with display screens and a circular platform.\n\nDuring the song's breakdown, they perform a choreographed dance routine on the tilting platform. The scenes are intercut with Jackson drawing an orange swirl and the AIBO watching the film in her apartment. Various people are also seen drawing orange swirls.

It was released as on [[contemporary hit radio]] on May 23 2000, after an [[Mastering (audio)|unmastered]] version was leaked. \"Doesn't Really Matter\" is a [[Pop music|pop]], [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] and [[Dance music|dance]] song that speaks about loving a person for who they are and disregarding their physical appearance. The track is based on an incomplete poem Jackson had written, which was later applied to her character in the film. The song was a contrast from the dark tone of her previous album ''[[The Velvet Rope]]'', returning to a brighter and more contemporary sound.\n\nThe song generally received positive reception, becoming Jackson's ninth number-one single in the United States after peaking on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] for three weeks. It was Jackson's 19th single to be [[Music recording certification|certified]] gold and the 13th best-selling single in 2000, selling over 600,000 copies in sales. It reached number five in the United Kingdom, where it attained a silver certification. The song peaked within the top 10 in Canada, Denmark, Poland, Italy, and Spain, as well as in the top 20 in Belgium, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland.\n\nThe [[music video]], directed by [[Joseph Kahn]], resembles an [[abstract art|abstract]], futuristic environment based on Japanese culture. In addition to scenes from the film, it also features futuristic technology, morphing clothes, and a dance sequence on a levitating platform. It had a reported cost of over $2.5 million (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|2.5|2000|r=1}}&nbsp;million in {{Inflation/year|US}}), causing it to become one of the [[List of most expensive music videos|most expensive music videos]] of all time. [[Jenna Dewan]] made one of her earliest appearances in the video, performing as a dancer. She was later personally offered by Jackson to appear in the music video for \"[[All for You (Janet Jackson song)|All for You]]\", and perform as a dancer on the [[All for You Tour]].\n\n==Background and development==\n\"Doesn't Really Matter\" was written and produced by [[Janet Jackson]], [[Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis]] as the theme for the [[Universal Pictures]] film ''[[Nutty Professor II: The Klumps]]'', starring Jackson and actor [[Eddie Murphy]].<ref name=\"LinerNotes\">{{Cite AV media notes|title=Doesn't Really Matter|others=[[Janet Jackson]]|year=2000|type=booklet|publisher=[[Def Jam Records]]|id=562 916-2|location=New York City}}</ref> She portrays Professor Denise Gaines in the film, the love interest of [[The Nutty Professor (character)|Sherman Klump]], who is one of many characters portrayed by Murphy.<ref name=\"KlumpsMTV\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1428172/20000523/dmx.jhtml|title=LL, Sisqo, Jay-Z, Foxy, DMX, More For \"Klumps\"|website=[[MTV News]]|date=May 23, 2000|access-date=December 10, 2019}}</ref> When asked to contribute a single for the [[Nutty Professor II: The Klumps (soundtrack)|movie's soundtrack]], Jackson stated that she would consider if she found an appropriate song.<ref name=\"Bronson\">{{cite book|last=Bronson|first=Fred|year=2003|title=Billboard's Hottest Hot 100 Hits|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard Books]]|edition=3|page=902|isbn=0823077381}}</ref> The single would allow Jackson to continue releasing music, while simultaneously devoting time to her film career.<ref>{{cite book|date=July 21\u201323, 2000|title=Action Jackson|work=[[USA Weekend]]|page=6}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|date=November 2000|title=Janet at the Crossroads|work=[[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]]|page=181}}</ref> To help inspire Jackson, director [[Peter Segal]] brought a rough cut of the film to Flyte Tyme Studios where the singer was recording her seventh album, ''[[All for You (Janet Jackson album)|All for You]]''.

During this scene, the AIBO and various objects in her room are shown, including a television displaying ''Nutty Professor II: The Klumps'', and a pair of [[moon shoes]]. Jackson then grabs a beverage from her fridge and starts singing in front of a mirror containing visually animated animal stickers. Four of her friends knock at her door and Jackson leaves with them. They dance through the apartment block hallway as their shoes morph into black futuristic high-heels, walking into an area filled with display screens and a circular platform.\n\nDuring the song's breakdown, they perform a choreographed dance routine on the tilting platform. The scenes are intercut with Jackson drawing an orange swirl and the AIBO watching the film in her apartment. Various people are also seen drawing orange swirls. In the next segment, Jackson is shown in the passenger seat of a car driving through a tunnel, as scenes from ''Nutty Professor II: The Klumps'' appear as a reflection in the front window. The video concludes with a [[slow motion]] shot of Jackson falling backwards onto her bed and the AIBO resting in front of her.\n\n===Reception===\nWriting for DVD Movie Guide, Colin Jacobson praised the music video for deviating from the standard \"lip-synch/film snippet formula\" used among pop videos at the time, stating that it \"stands on its own\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdmg.com/klumpsuncensored.shtml|title=Nutty Professor II: The Klumps \u2013 Uncensored Director's Cut (2000)|website=DVD Movie Guide|last=Jacobson|first=Colin|year=2000|accessdate=February 7, 2014}}</ref> Rod Stafford Hagwood of the ''Sun-Sentinel'' included \"Doesn't Really Matter\" among several videos which set fashion trends and increased the popularity of \"bright colorful clothes\" among youth.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2000-08-08/lifestyle/0008070457_1_colors-young-women-video|title=What Are The Coolest Kids Wearing This Fall?

Muhammad, according to tradition, recited perfectly what the archangel Gabriel revealed to him for his companions to write down and memorize. Muslims believe that the wording of the Quranic text available today corresponds exactly to that [[Wahy|revealed]] to Muhammad in the years 610\u2013632.<ref>John Esposito, ''Islam the Straight Path'', Extended Edition, p.19-20</ref>\n\nThe early Arabic script transcribed 28 consonants, of which only 6 can be readily distinguished, the remaining 22 having formal similarities which means that what specific consonant is intended can only be determined by context. It was only with the introduction of [[Arabic diacritics]] some centuries later, that an authorized vocalization of the text, and how it was to be read, was established and became canonical.<ref>[[Christoph Luxenberg]] [https://books.google.com/books?id=227GhaeKYl4C&pg=PA36 ''The Syro-Aramaic Reading of the Koran: A Contribution to the Decoding of the Language of the Koran.''] Verlag Hans Schiler, 2007 {{isbn|978-3-899-30088-8}} p.31.</ref>\n\nPrior to this period, there is evidence that the unpointed text could be read in different ways, with different meanings. [[Al-Tabari|Tabar\u012b]] prefaces his early commentary on the Quran illustrating that the precise way to read the verses of the sacred text was not fixed even in the day of the Prophet. Two men disputing a verse in the text asked [[Ubay ibn Ka'b]] to mediate, and he disagreed with them, coming up with a third reading. To resolve the question, the three went to Muhammad. He asked first one-man to read out the verse, and announced it was correct. He made the same response when the second alternative reading was delivered. He then asked Ubay to provide his own recital, and, on hearing the third version, Muhammad also pronounced it \u2018Correct!\u2019. Noting Ubay's perplexity and inner thoughts, Muhammad then told him, \u2018Pray to God for protection from the accursed Satan.\u2019<ref>Christoph Luxenberg, 2007 p.36</ref>\n\n===Similarities with Jewish and Christian narratives===\n{{Main|Biblical and Quranic narratives|List of legends in the Quran|Islamic views on Jesus' death}}\nThe Quran contains references to [[List of people in both the Bible and the Quran|more than 50 people in the Bible]], which predates it by several centuries. Stories related in the Quran usually focus more on the spiritual significance of events than details.<ref>e.g. Gerald Hawting, interviewed for The Religion Report, Radio National (Australia), 26 June 2002.</ref> The stories are generally comparable, but there are differences. One of the most famous differences is the Islamic view of Jesus' crucifixion. The Quran maintains that Jesus was not actually crucified and did not die on the cross. The general Islamic view supporting the denial of crucifixion was probably influenced by [[Manichaenism]] ([[Docetism]]), which holds that someone else was crucified instead of Jesus, while concluding that Jesus will return during the end-times.<ref>Joel L. Kraemer ''Israel Oriental Studies XII'' BRILL 1992 {{ISBN|9789004095847}} p. 41</ref>\n{{quote|That they said (in boast), \"We killed [[Christ]] Jesus the son of [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]], the [[Messengers of Islam|Messenger]] of [[Allah]]\";- but they killed him not, nor crucified him, but so it was made to appear to them, and those who differ therein are full of doubts, with no (certain) knowledge, but only conjecture to follow, for of a surety they killed him not:-<br>Nay, Allah raised him up unto Himself; and Allah is Exalted in Power, Wise;-|Qur'an, [[sura]] 4 ([[An-Nisa]]) [[ayah|ayat]] 157\u2013158<ref>{{cite book|last=Lawson|first=Todd|date=1 March 2009|title=The Crucifixion and the Quran: A Study in the History of Muslim Thought|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C1cQBwAAQBAJ&pg=PA12|location=|publisher=Oneworld Publications|page=12|isbn=1851686355}}</ref>}}\n\nDespite these views, scholars have maintained that the [[Crucifixion of Jesus]] is a fact of history and not disputed.<ref>Eddy, Paul Rhodes and Gregory A. Boyd (2007). The Jesus Legend: A Case for the Historical Reliability of the Synoptic Jesus Tradition. Baker Academic. p. 172. {{ISBN|0801031141}}. ...if there is any fact of Jesus' life that has been established by a broad consensus, it is the fact of Jesus' crucifixion.</ref>\n\n===Earliest witness testimony===\nThe last recensions to make an official and uniform Quran in a single dialect were effected under [[Uthman#Reign as a Caliph .28644.E2.80.93656.29|Caliph Uthman]] (644\u2013656) starting some twelve years after the Prophet's death and finishing twenty-four years after the effort began, with all other existing personal and individual copies and dialects of the Quran being burned:\n\n{{quote | When they had copied the sheets, Uthman sent a copy to each of the main centers of the empire with the command that all other Qur'an materials, whether in single sheet form, or in whole volumes, were to be burned.<ref>(Burton, pp. 141\u201342 \u2013 citing Ahmad b. `Ali b.

Since the official compilation was completed two decades after Muhammad's death, the Uthman text has been scrupulously preserved. Bucaille believed that this did not give rise to any problems of this Quran's authenticity.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bucaille|first=Dr. Maurice|title=The Bible, the Quran, and Science: The Holy Scriptures Examined in the Light of Modern Knowledge|year=1977|publisher=TTQ, INC.f|isbn=978-1-879402-98-0 |page=268|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sN65wjDOQH0C&pg=PA256}}</ref>\n\n[[William Muir|Muir]]'s ''The Life of Mahomet'' explains the outcome of these oral traditions when researching Al-Bukhari:\n\n{{quote | Reliance upon oral traditions, at a time when they were transmitted by memory alone, and every day produced new divisions among the professors of Islam, opened up a wide field for fabrication and distortion. There was nothing easier, when required to defend any religious or political system, than to appeal to an oral tradition of the Prophet. The nature of these so-called traditions, and the manner in which the name of Muhammad was abused to support all possible lies and absurdities, may be gathered most clearly from the fact that Al-Bukhari who travelled from land to land to gather from the learned the traditions they had received, came to conclusion, after many years sifting, that out of 600,000 traditions, ascertained by him to be then current, only 4000 were authentic!<ref>Muir, ''The Life of Mahomet'', 3rd Edition, Indian Reprint, New Delhi, 1992, pp. 41\u201342.</ref>''}}\n\nRegarding who was the first to collect the narrations, and whether or not it was compiled into a single book by the time of Muhammad's death is contradicted by witnesses living when Muhammad lived, several historical narratives appear:\n\nZaid b.

This palimpsest has two layers of text, both of which are Quranic and written in the [[Hijazi script]]. While the upper text is almost identical with the modern Qurans in use (with the exception of spelling variants), the lower text contains significant diversions from the standard text. For example, in sura 2, verse 87, the lower text has ''wa-qaffayn\u0101 'al\u0101 \u0101th\u0101rihi'' whereas the standard text has ''wa-qaffayn\u0101 min ba'dihi''. The Sana'a manuscript has exactly the same verses and the same order of verses as the standard Qur'an.{{sfn|Sadeghi|Goudarzi|2012|p=26}} The order of the suras in the Sana'a codex is different from the order in the standard Quran.{{sfn|Sadeghi|Goudarzi|2012|p=23}} Such variants are similar to the ones reported for the Quran codices of Companions such as [[Ibn Masud]] and [[Ubay ibn Ka'b]]. However, variants occur much more frequently in the Sana'a codex, which contains \"by a rough estimate perhaps twenty-five times as many [as Ibn Mas'ud's reported variants]\".{{sfn|Sadeghi|Goudarzi|2012|p=20}}\n\nIn 2015, the [[University of Birmingham]] disclosed that scientific tests may show a Quran manuscript in its collection as one of the oldest known and believe it was written close to the time of Muhammad. The findings in 2015 of the Birmingham Manuscripts lead Joseph E. B. Lumbard, Assistant Professor of Classical Islam, Brandeis University, to comment:<ref name=\"Joseph E. B.

As for the reading of Hafs, the study presents evidence that the latter had learned the Quran from two sources: 'Asim who was his main teacher, and Imam Ja'far al-Sadiq who provided him with a corrective of 'Asim's reading.

The central ayah that deals with abrogation is Surah 2:106:\n\n:\"We do not abrogate a verse or cause it to be forgotten except that We bring forth [one] better than it or similar to it.

[[Ghulam Ahmed Parwez]] in his ''Exposition of the Quran'' derived the following meaning from the verse 2:106, making it consistent with the overall content of the Quran:\n: ''The Ahl-ul-Kitab (People of the Book) also question the need for a new revelation (Qur'an) when previous revelations from Allah exist. They further ask why the Qur'an contains injunctions contrary to the earlier Revelation (the Torah) if it is from Allah? Tell them that Our way of sending Revelation to successive anbiya (prophets) is that: Injunctions given in earlier revelations, which were meant only for a particular time, are replaced by other injunctions, and injunctions which were to remain in force permanently but were abandoned, forgotten or adulterated by the followers of previous anbiya are given again in their original form (22:52). And all this happens in accordance with Our laid down standards, over which We have complete control. Now this last code of life which contains the truth of all previous revelations (5:48), is complete in every respect (6:116), and will always be preserved (15:9), has been given [to mankind].''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tolueislam.org/exposition-of-the-holy-quran-02-surah-al-baqarah-g-a-parwez/ |title=Exposition of the Holy Quran \u2013 Ghulam Ahmad Parwez \u2013 Tolue Islam Trust |publisher=tolueislam.org |date= |accessdate=2015-07-31}}</ref>\n\n===Satanic verses===\n{{Main|Satanic Verses}}\n\nSome criticism of the Quran has revolved around two verses known as the \"[[Satanic Verses]]\".

The Arabic word does generally mean a \"crane\" \u2013 appearing in the singular as ''ghirn\u012bq, ghurn\u016bq, ghirnawq'' and ''ghurnayq'', and the word has cousin forms in other words for birds, including \"raven, crow\" and \"eagle\".<ref>{{Citation\n| last =Militarev\n| first =Alexander\n| author-link =\n| last2 =Kogan\n| first2 =Leonid\n| author2-link =\n| publication-date =\n| year =2005\n| title =Semitic Etymological Dictionary 2: Animal Names\n| edition =\n| volume =278/2\n| series =Alter Orient und Altes Testament\n| publication-place =M\u00fcnster\n| place =\n| publisher =Ugarit-Verlag\n| pages =131\u201332\n| page =\n| id =\n| isbn =3-934628-57-5\n| doi =\n| oclc =\n| url =\n| accessdate =}}</ref>\n\nThe subtext to the event is that Muhammad was backing away from his otherwise uncompromising [[monotheism]] by saying that these goddesses were real and their intercession effective. The Meccans were overjoyed to hear this and joined Muhammad in ritual prostration at the end of the ''s\u016brah''. The Meccan refugees who had fled to Abyssinia heard of the end of persecution and started to return home. Islamic tradition holds that Gabriel chastised Muhammad for adulterating the revelation, at which point {{Quran-usc|22|52}} is revealed to comfort him,\n{{quote|Never sent We a messenger or a prophet before thee but when He recited (the message) Satan proposed (opposition) in respect of that which he recited thereof. But Allah abolisheth that which Satan proposeth. Then Allah establisheth His revelations.

Verses {{Quran-usc-range|53|21|23}} were given, in which the goddesses are belittled. The passage in question, from 53:19, reads:\n\n<blockquote>Have ye thought upon Al-Lat and Al-'Uzza\n<br />And Manat, the third, the other?\n<br />Are yours the males and His the females?\n<br />That indeed were an unfair division!\n<br />They are but names which ye have named, ye and your fathers, for which Allah hath revealed no warrant. They follow but a guess and that which (they) themselves desire. And now the guidance from their Lord hath come unto them.</blockquote>\n\nThe incident of the Satanic Verses is put forward by some critics as evidence of the Quran's origins as a human work of Muhammad. [[Maxime Rodinson]] describes this as a conscious attempt to achieve a consensus with pagan Arabs, which was then consciously rejected as incompatible with Muhammad's attempts to answer the criticism of contemporary Arab Jews and Christians,<ref>Maxime Rodinson, ''Muhammad'' (Tauris Parke, London, 2002) ({{ISBN|1-86064-827-4}}) pp. 107\u201308.</ref> linking it with the moment at which Muhammad felt able to adopt a \"hostile attitude\" towards the pagan Arabs.<ref>Maxime Rodinson, ''Muhammad'' (Tauris Parke, London, 2002) ({{ISBN|1-86064-827-4}}) p. 113.</ref> Rodinson writes that the story of the Satanic Verses is unlikely to be false because it was \"one incident, in fact, which may be reasonably accepted as true because the makers of Muslim tradition would not have invented a story with such damaging implications for the revelation as a whole\".<ref>Maxime Rodinson, ''Muhammad'' (Tauris Parke, London, 2002) ({{ISBN|1-86064-827-4}}) p. 106</ref> In a caveat to his acceptance of the incident, William Montgomery Watt, states: \"Thus it was not for any worldly motive that Muhammad eventually turned down the offer of the Meccans, but for a genuinely religious reason; not for example, because he could not trust these men nor because any personal ambition would remain unsatisfied, but because acknowledgment of the goddesses would lead to the failure of the cause, of the mission he had been given by God.\"<ref>W. Montgomery Watt, ''Muhammad at Mecca'', Oxford, 1953. 'The Growth of Opposition', p. 105</ref> Academic scholars such as [[William Montgomery Watt]] and [[Alfred Guillaume]] argued for its authenticity based upon the implausibility of Muslims fabricating a story so unflattering to their prophet.

Muhammad, according to tradition, recited perfectly what the archangel Gabriel revealed to him for his companions to write down and memorize. Muslims believe that the wording of the Quranic text available today corresponds exactly to that [[Wahy|revealed]] to Muhammad in the years 610\u2013632.<ref>John Esposito, ''Islam the Straight Path'', Extended Edition, p.19-20</ref>\n\nThe early Arabic script transcribed 28 consonants, of which only 6 can be readily distinguished, the remaining 22 having formal similarities which means that what specific consonant is intended can only be determined by context. It was only with the introduction of [[Arabic diacritics]] some centuries later, that an authorized vocalization of the text, and how it was to be read, was established and became canonical.<ref>[[Christoph Luxenberg]] [https://books.google.com/books?id=227GhaeKYl4C&pg=PA36 ''The Syro-Aramaic Reading of the Koran: A Contribution to the Decoding of the Language of the Koran.''] Verlag Hans Schiler, 2007 {{isbn|978-3-899-30088-8}} p.31.</ref>\n\nPrior to this period, there is evidence that the unpointed text could be read in different ways, with different meanings. [[Al-Tabari|Tabar\u012b]] prefaces his early commentary on the Quran illustrating that the precise way to read the verses of the sacred text was not fixed even in the day of the Prophet. Two men disputing a verse in the text asked [[Ubay ibn Ka'b]] to mediate, and he disagreed with them, coming up with a third reading. To resolve the question, the three went to Muhammad. He asked first one-man to read out the verse, and announced it was correct. He made the same response when the second alternative reading was delivered. He then asked Ubay to provide his own recital, and, on hearing the third version, Muhammad also pronounced it \u2018Correct!\u2019. Noting Ubay's perplexity and inner thoughts, Muhammad then told him, \u2018Pray to God for protection from the accursed Satan.\u2019<ref>Christoph Luxenberg, 2007 p.36</ref>\n\n===Similarities with Jewish and Christian narratives===\n{{Main|Biblical and Quranic narratives|List of legends in the Quran|Islamic views on Jesus' death}}\nThe Quran contains references to [[List of people in both the Bible and the Quran|more than 50 people in the Bible]], which predates it by several centuries. Stories related in the Quran usually focus more on the spiritual significance of events than details.<ref>e.g. Gerald Hawting, interviewed for The Religion Report, Radio National (Australia), 26 June 2002.</ref> The stories are generally comparable, but there are differences. One of the most famous differences is the Islamic view of Jesus' crucifixion. The Quran maintains that Jesus was not actually crucified and did not die on the cross. The general Islamic view supporting the denial of crucifixion was probably influenced by [[Manichaenism]] ([[Docetism]]), which holds that someone else was crucified instead of Jesus, while concluding that Jesus will return during the end-times.<ref>Joel L.

They further ask why the Qur'an contains injunctions contrary to the earlier Revelation (the Torah) if it is from Allah? Tell them that Our way of sending Revelation to successive anbiya (prophets) is that: Injunctions given in earlier revelations, which were meant only for a particular time, are replaced by other injunctions, and injunctions which were to remain in force permanently but were abandoned, forgotten or adulterated by the followers of previous anbiya are given again in their original form (22:52).

The Arabic word does generally mean a \"crane\" \u2013 appearing in the singular as ''ghirn\u012bq, ghurn\u016bq, ghirnawq'' and ''ghurnayq'', and the word has cousin forms in other words for birds, including \"raven, crow\" and \"eagle\".<ref>{{Citation\n| last =Militarev\n| first =Alexander\n| author-link =\n| last2 =Kogan\n| first2 =Leonid\n| author2-link =\n| publication-date =\n| year =2005\n| title =Semitic Etymological Dictionary 2: Animal Names\n| edition =\n| volume =278/2\n| series =Alter Orient und Altes Testament\n| publication-place =M\u00fcnster\n| place =\n| publisher =Ugarit-Verlag\n| pages =131\u201332\n| page =\n| id =\n| isbn =3-934628-57-5\n| doi =\n| oclc =\n| url =\n| accessdate =}}</ref>\n\nThe subtext to the event is that Muhammad was backing away from his otherwise uncompromising [[monotheism]] by saying that these goddesses were real and their intercession effective. The Meccans were overjoyed to hear this and joined Muhammad in ritual prostration at the end of the ''s\u016brah''. The Meccan refugees who had fled to Abyssinia heard of the end of persecution and started to return home. Islamic tradition holds that Gabriel chastised Muhammad for adulterating the revelation, at which point {{Quran-usc|22|52}} is revealed to comfort him,\n{{quote|Never sent We a messenger or a prophet before thee but when He recited (the message) Satan proposed (opposition) in respect of that which he recited thereof. But Allah abolisheth that which Satan proposeth. Then Allah establisheth His revelations. Allah is Knower, Wise.}}\n\nMuhammad took back his words and the [[fitna (word)|persecution]] of the Meccans resumed. Verses {{Quran-usc-range|53|21|23}} were given, in which the goddesses are belittled. The passage in question, from 53:19, reads:\n\n<blockquote>Have ye thought upon Al-Lat and Al-'Uzza\n<br />And Manat, the third, the other?\n<br />Are yours the males and His the females?\n<br />That indeed were an unfair division!\n<br />They are but names which ye have named, ye and your fathers, for which Allah hath revealed no warrant. They follow but a guess and that which (they) themselves desire. And now the guidance from their Lord hath come unto them.</blockquote>\n\nThe incident of the Satanic Verses is put forward by some critics as evidence of the Quran's origins as a human work of Muhammad. [[Maxime Rodinson]] describes this as a conscious attempt to achieve a consensus with pagan Arabs, which was then consciously rejected as incompatible with Muhammad's attempts to answer the criticism of contemporary Arab Jews and Christians,<ref>Maxime Rodinson, ''Muhammad'' (Tauris Parke, London, 2002) ({{ISBN|1-86064-827-4}}) pp. 107\u201308.</ref> linking it with the moment at which Muhammad felt able to adopt a \"hostile attitude\" towards the pagan Arabs.<ref>Maxime Rodinson, ''Muhammad'' (Tauris Parke, London, 2002) ({{ISBN|1-86064-827-4}}) p. 113.</ref> Rodinson writes that the story of the Satanic Verses is unlikely to be false because it was \"one incident, in fact, which may be reasonably accepted as true because the makers of Muslim tradition would not have invented a story with such damaging implications for the revelation as a whole\".<ref>Maxime Rodinson, ''Muhammad'' (Tauris Parke, London, 2002) ({{ISBN|1-86064-827-4}}) p. 106</ref> In a caveat to his acceptance of the incident, William Montgomery Watt, states: \"Thus it was not for any worldly motive that Muhammad eventually turned down the offer of the Meccans, but for a genuinely religious reason; not for example, because he could not trust these men nor because any personal ambition would remain unsatisfied, but because acknowledgment of the goddesses would lead to the failure of the cause, of the mission he had been given by God.\"<ref>W. Montgomery Watt, ''Muhammad at Mecca'', Oxford, 1953.

''Journal of Semitic Studies'' 15: 246\u2013264.</ref> Burton's argument is that such stories served the vested interests of the status-quo, allowing them to dilute the radical messages of the Quran. The rulers used such narratives to build their own set of laws which contradicted the Quran, and justified it by arguing that not all of the Quran is binding on Muslims. Burton also sides with [[Leone Caetani]], who wrote that the story of the \"satanic verses\" should be rejected not only on the basis of ''isnad'', but because ''\"had these hadiths even a degree of historical basis, Muhammad's reported conduct on this occasion would have given the lie to the whole of his previous prophetic activity.\"''<ref>Quoted by I.R Netton in \"Text and Trauma: An East-West Primer\" (1996) p. 86, Routledge</ref> Eerik Dickinson also pointed out that the Quran's challenge to its opponents to prove any inconsistency in its content was pronounced in a hostile environment, also indicating that such an incident did not occur or it would have greatly damaged the Muslims.<ref>Eerik Dickinson, ''Difficult Passages'', Encyclopaedia of the Qur\u02be\u0101n</ref>\n\n===Intended audience===\nSome verses of the Quran are assumed to be directed towards all of Muhammad's followers while other verses are directed more specifically towards Muhammad and his wives, yet others are directed towards the whole of humanity.\n([https://web.archive.org/web/20140606204827/http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/033-qmt.php#033.028 33:28], [https://web.archive.org/web/20140606204827/http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/033-qmt.php#033.050 33:50], [https://web.archive.org/web/20160527105235/http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/049-qmt.php#049.002 49:2], [https://web.archive.org/web/20160527111014/http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/058-qmt.php#058.001 58:1], [https://web.archive.org/web/20160527111014/http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/058-qmt.php#058.009 58:9] [https://web.archive.org/web/20160414060718/http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/066-qmt.php#066.003 66:3]).\n\nOther scholars argue that variances in the Quran's explicit intended audiences are irrelevant to claims of divine origin \u2013 and for example that Muhammad's wives \"specific divine guidance, occasioned by their proximity to the Prophet (Muhammad)\" where \"Numerous divine reprimands addressed to Muhammad's wives in the Quran establish their special responsibility to overcome their human frailties and ensure their individual worthiness\",<ref>''Women in the Quran, traditions, and interpretation'' by Barbara Freyer, p. 85, Mothers of the Believers in the Quran</ref> or argue that the Quran must be interpreted on more than one level.<ref>Corbin (1993), p. 7</ref> (See:<ref>[[Quran#Levels of meaning]]</ref>).\n\n==Jurisprudence==\nBritish-German professor of Arabic and Islam [[Joseph Schacht]], in his work ''[[The Origins of Muhammadan Jurisprudence]]'' (1950) regarding the subject of law derived from the Quran, wrote:\n\n{{quote|''\"Muhammadan [Islamic] law did not derive directly from the Koran but developed ...out of popular and administrative practice under the Umaiyads, and this practice often diverged from the intentions and even the explicit wording of the Koran ....

The image is transmitted via radio waves (typically 2.4&nbsp;GHz or 5.8&nbsp;GHz frequency) to goggles or monitor worn by the pilot. The remote control, drone, and goggles are all connected via radio and must transmit with sufficient speed and reliability to allow effective control. This technology is very new and is constantly being improved. FPV goggles on the market range from $50 to $500, with the more expensive goggles offering more and better features. Some of these features include a wide field of view (FOV), receiver diversity, head tracking, multiple frequency settings, and DVR (digital video recorder) recording functionality.<ref name=\"Complete FPV Goggles Guide\">{{cite web|url=https://oscarliang.com/fpv-goggles-review-fatshark-skyzone/|title=Complete FPV Goggles Guide|accessdate=August 9, 2017|work=www.oscarliang.com}}</ref>\n\nWhile the pilot always requires goggles, some drone racing organizations insist they should also be used among spectators alike by simply switching the frequency to the channel of the racer one wants to watch.\n\nAny drone could be used to race, however competitive FPV racing leagues require drones to meet certain standards.\n\n[[MultiGP]], defines community produced specifications and allows participants to supply their own drones increasing competitiveness and innovation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.multigp.com/page/FPV-racing-classes|title=MultiGP - {{!}} 2016 MultiGP Classes &amp; Specifications|website=MultiGP|access-date=2016-04-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160505142129/http://www.multigp.com/page/FPV-racing-classes|archive-date=2016-05-05|url-status=dead}}</ref> For competition, aircraft are typically separated into classes, separating winged craft from rotorcraft; and also categorising by size and power.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.multigp.com/page/FPV-racing-classes|title=MultiGP - - 2016 MultiGP Classes & Specifications|access-date=2016-04-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160505142129/http://www.multigp.com/page/FPV-racing-classes|archive-date=2016-05-05|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n[[Drone Racing League|The Drone Racing League]] (DRL) makes all of the drones used in its events in house; pilots are supplied with drones, backup drones, and parts by the league itself, not independently.\n\nDR1 Racing, utilizes an open spec class format that relies on each team in the series to supply their own drones, goggles and gear.

A racing model will typically have its four motors configured in an H-pattern configured to thrust the drone forward, not up. Another specific characteristic of drone racing is the number of propeller\u2019s blades. 3-blade or 4-blade (instead of 2-blade) propellers have a shorter diameter allowing for a smaller frame with increased acceleration and maneuverability capabilities. Because of their light weight and electric motors with large amounts of [[torque]], drones can accelerate and maneuver with great speed and agility. This makes for very sensitive controls and requires a pilot with quick reaction times and a steady hand.\n\n[[BMW]] held the [[Drone Racing League]]\u2019s 2018 Semi Finals race at their automobile museum, the [[BMW Welt]], in Munich, Germany and sold out the event with 3,000 fans.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.automotiveworld.com/news-releases/the-2018-drl-allianz-world-championship-at-bmw-|title=The 2018 DRL Allianz World Championship at BMW Welt on July, 28.

Similar to full size [[air racing]] the goal is to complete a set course as quickly as possible.

This is accomplished by live streaming footage from a camera mounted on the nose of the drone. The image is transmitted via radio waves (typically 2.4&nbsp;GHz or 5.8&nbsp;GHz frequency) to goggles or monitor worn by the pilot. The remote control, drone, and goggles are all connected via radio and must transmit with sufficient speed and reliability to allow effective control. This technology is very new and is constantly being improved. FPV goggles on the market range from $50 to $500, with the more expensive goggles offering more and better features. Some of these features include a wide field of view (FOV), receiver diversity, head tracking, multiple frequency settings, and DVR (digital video recorder) recording functionality.<ref name=\"Complete FPV Goggles Guide\">{{cite web|url=https://oscarliang.com/fpv-goggles-review-fatshark-skyzone/|title=Complete FPV Goggles Guide|accessdate=August 9, 2017|work=www.oscarliang.com}}</ref>\n\nWhile the pilot always requires goggles, some drone racing organizations insist they should also be used among spectators alike by simply switching the frequency to the channel of the racer one wants to watch.\n\nAny drone could be used to race, however competitive FPV racing leagues require drones to meet certain standards.\n\n[[MultiGP]], defines community produced specifications and allows participants to supply their own drones increasing competitiveness and innovation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.multigp.com/page/FPV-racing-classes|title=MultiGP - {{!}} 2016 MultiGP Classes &amp; Specifications|website=MultiGP|access-date=2016-04-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160505142129/http://www.multigp.com/page/FPV-racing-classes|archive-date=2016-05-05|url-status=dead}}</ref> For competition, aircraft are typically separated into classes, separating winged craft from rotorcraft; and also categorising by size and power.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.multigp.com/page/FPV-racing-classes|title=MultiGP - - 2016 MultiGP Classes & Specifications|access-date=2016-04-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160505142129/http://www.multigp.com/page/FPV-racing-classes|archive-date=2016-05-05|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n[[Drone Racing League|The Drone Racing League]] (DRL) makes all of the drones used in its events in house; pilots are supplied with drones, backup drones, and parts by the league itself, not independently.\n\nDR1 Racing, utilizes an open spec class format that relies on each team in the series to supply their own drones, goggles and gear.

A racing model will typically have its four motors configured in an H-pattern configured to thrust the drone forward, not up. Another specific characteristic of drone racing is the number of propeller\u2019s blades. 3-blade or 4-blade (instead of 2-blade) propellers have a shorter diameter allowing for a smaller frame with increased acceleration and maneuverability capabilities. Because of their light weight and electric motors with large amounts of [[torque]], drones can accelerate and maneuver with great speed and agility. This makes for very sensitive controls and requires a pilot with quick reaction times and a steady hand.\n\n[[BMW]] held the [[Drone Racing League]]\u2019s 2018 Semi Finals race at their automobile museum, the [[BMW Welt]], in Munich, Germany and sold out the event with 3,000 fans.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.automotiveworld.com/news-releases/the-2018-drl-allianz-world-championship-at-bmw-|title=The 2018 DRL Allianz World Championship at BMW Welt on July, 28.

At events like the one held at the [[California State Fair]], funding comes from the state and from ticket sales at the event. Along with the difficulties of finding funding, it creates problems of finding good venues that create a challenge for the pilots and also have key turns and straightaways adding to the exhilaration of these events.
