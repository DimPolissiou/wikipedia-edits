Following a short period of training it went to the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] with other Kitchener battalions and endured a disastrous initiation at the [[Battle of Loos]]. It was then transferred to the experienced [[3rd (United Kingdom) Division|3rd Division]] and fought with it on the [[Battle of the Somme|Somme]], at [[Battle of Arras (1917)|Arras]] and [[Battle of Passchendaele|Ypres]]. After heavy casualties the battalion was disbanded early in 1918.\n\n==Recruitment and training==\n[[File:30a Sammlung Eybl Gro\u00dfbritannien. Alfred Leete (1882\u20131933) Britons (Kitchener) wants you (Briten Kitchener braucht Euch). 1914 (Nachdruck), 74 x 50 cm. (Slg.Nr. 552).jpg|right|thumb|[[Alfred Leete]]'s recruitment poster for Kitchener's Army.]]\nOn 6 August 1914, less than 48 hours after Britain's declaration of war, [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] sanctioned an increase of 500,000 men for the Regular [[British Army]], and the newly-appointed [[Secretary of State for War]], [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Earl Kitchener of Khartoum]] issued his famous call to arms: 'Your King and Country Need You', urging the first 100,000 volunteers to come forward. This group of six divisions with supporting arms became known as Kitchener's First New Army, or 'K1', and was quickly followed by 'K2' and 'K3' as a flood of volunteers poured into the recruiting offices and were formed into 'Service' battalions at the regimental depots. The [[East Yorkshire Regiment]] formed its third such battalion, the '''8th (Service) Battalion''', on 22 September at [[Berkhamsted]], [[Hertfordshire]], from a draft of recruits sent from the depot at [[Victoria Barracks, Beverley]].<ref>Becke, Pt 3a, pp. 2 & 8; Appendix I.</ref><ref name = Frederick>Frederick, p. 182.</ref><ref name = James>James, p. 59.</ref><ref name = Wyrall24>Wyrall, p. 24.</ref><ref name = TrailER>[http://www.longlongtrail.co.uk/army/regiments-and-corps/the-british-infantry-regiments-of-1914-1918/east-yorkshire-regiment/ East Yorkshires at Long, Long Trail.]</ref>{{efn|The second [[Pals battalion]] raised in [[Hull]], known as the 'Hull Tradesmen', was originally going to be the 8th (Hull) Bn, but this was changed to [[Hull Pals|11th (Service) Bn (2nd Hull)]].<ref>Wyrall, p. 23.</ref>}}\n[[File:British 21st Division insignia.png|thumb|200px|right|21st Division's insignia.]]\nThe new battalion was assigned to [[62nd Brigade (United Kingdom)|62nd Brigade]] in [[21st Division (United Kingdom)|21st Division]], the senior K3 division, formed from units raised in North East England, which was assembling around [[Tring]] in Hertfordshire. The men started out in [[Billet|billets]], but the division soon moved under canvas at [[RAF Halton|Halton Park]]. Throughout October drafts arrived from Beverley until on 4 November the battalion reached a strength of 25 officers and 1092 other ranks under the command of [[Lieutenant colonel (United Kingdom)|Lieutenant-Colonel]] L.C. Fryer. Mud and rain brought a return to billets for the winter, with 8th East Yorkshires housed in [[Wendover]], [[Aston Clinton]] and [[Weston Turville]].<ref name = James/><ref name = Wyrall24/><ref name = Becke21>Becke, Pt 3a, pp. 103\u20139.</ref><ref name = Trail21>[http://www.longlongtrail.co.uk/army/order-of-battle-of-divisions/21st-division/ 21st Division  at Long, Long Trail.]</ref><ref name = Edmonds1915p293>Edmonds, ''1915'', Vol II, pp. 293\u20134.</ref>\n\nHuts had been built at Halton by the time the division returned there in May 1915, and training continued. Towards the end of June the first service rifles arrived and the men began their musketry courses. This was completed by 9 August, when the infantry began moving to [[Witley Camp]] in [[Surrey]]. Although its training was still woefully inadequate (the K1 and K2 units had taken all the best instructors and staff officers), the division soon received orders to join the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]] on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]], and advance parties left at the beginning of September. 8th East Yorkshires crossed to [[Boulogne]] on 8\u20139 September under the command of Lt-Col B.I. Way ([[North Staffordshire Regiment]]). By 13 September 21st Division was concentrated west of [[Saint-Omer|St Omer]] with 8th EYR billeted in [[Moulle]]. Final training took place, in route marching, [[Grenade|bomb-throwing]], sniping, and machine-gun practice, culminating in an attack on practice trenches. Less than two weeks after arrival it was thrown into a major attack at the [[Battle of Loos]], without the men ever having visited the frontline trenches.<ref name = Becke21/><ref name = Edmonds1915p293/><ref>Wyrall, pp. 81\u20132.</ref>\n\n===Loos===\n[[File:Battle_of_Loos,_1915_png.png|thumb|300px|left|The battlefield of Loos.]]\nThe move south to Loos was achieved by a series of night marches beginning on 20/21 September, arriving at [[N\u0153ux-les-Mines]] at 23.00 on 24 September, when the men [[Bivouac shelter|bivouacked]] in open fields in heavy rain. The British attack was launched at 06.30 the following morning, and at 11.15 62nd Bde was ordered up to a concentration area north of [[Mazingarbe]]. Before the men had time to eat, orders arrived for the brigade to go up to support [[15th (Scottish) Division]], which was believed to have captured Hill 70. The brigadier selected 8th EYR and 10th [[Green Howards]] for this task. Without time for reconnaissance all he could do was point out Hill 70 on the map and tell the battalion commanders: 'We do not know what has happened on Hill 70. You must go and find out: if the Germans hold it, attack them; if our people are there, support them; if no-one is there, dig in'. As the inexperienced battalions set out (still accompanied by their transport) they were instructed by a military policeman that according to trench routine they must open out, with intervals between sections. Spacing out the columns took time, and it was 16.30 before they crossed the old front line and headed for [[Loos-en-Gohelle|Loos]]. Shortly afterwards they came in full view of German artillery, which practically destroyed the battalion transport. Instead of going through the village of Loos and north of the Loos Crassier spoil heap, the 8th Yorkshires, followed by 10th Green Howards, passed on the south side, bumping into [[20th Battalion, London Regiment (Blackheath and Woolwich)|1/20th Londons]] of [[47th (1/2nd London) Division]], which was holding part of the German positions. The CO of 1/20th Londons tried to stop the advance, but the two Yorkshire battalions carried on in extended lines towards Chalk Pit Copse, well south of Hill 70. A few minutes later they came under intense machine gun fire from the German-held part of the copse, 8th EYR and the leading companies of 10th Green Howards sustaining heavy casualties. In the confusion and gathering darkness some troops trying to retrace their steps and go through Loos were mistaken for attackers and fired upon by the rear companies of 10th Green Howards. It was 19.30 before Lt-Col Way and the CO of the Green Howards were able to restore order. 8th East Yorkshires, together with the remnants of the [[19th Battalion, London Regiment (St Pancras)|1/19th Londons]], dug in, continuing the line of 1/20th Londons over the Crassier into the outskirts of Loos village. Two companies dug communication trenches back towards the old front line, and cleared German stragglers out of Loos.<ref>Cherry, pp. 175\u20136.</ref><ref>Edmonds, ''1915'', Vol II, pp. 296\u20138.</ref><ref>Wyrall, pp. 82\u20135.</ref>\n\nThe attack on Hill 70 was renewed next morning after an hour-long bombardment. The main attack was made by 15th (S) Division, with 62nd Bde in support. As the bombardment ended Lt-Col Way led C and D Companies (about 120 men) with a few of the Londons and a few [[Northumberland Fusiliers]] towards Hill 70. The mist suddenly cleared and they were clearly visible to the German outposts on the hill. Although some men reached the enemy trenches the lines 'withered away' (in the words of the ''Official History'') and flanking fire forced them to retreat. The Crassier then came under shellfire, and snipers and machine guns caused steady casualties. While A and B Companies maintained their position on the Crassier until relieved the following afternoon, Lt-Col Way (who had been wounded) ordered the remainder back to the cover of the village and the support trenches where they joined [[23rd (County of London) Battalion, London Regiment|1/23rd Londons]] and were shelled all night. At 16.30 on 27 September the battalion went into bivouacs at [[Sailly-Labourse]] when a roll-call revealed that the battalion had lost 7 officers killed or missing and 12 wounded, 154 other ranks killed or missing and 133 wounded. Next day the battalion entrained for [[Liettres]] where it began refitting.<ref>Cherry, pp. 194\u20139.</ref><ref>Edmonds, ''1915'', Vol II, pp. 310\u20134, 342.</ref><ref>Wyrall, pp. 85\u20136.</ref>\n[[File:3rd Division WW1.svg|thumb|150px|right|3rd Division's  WWI insignia.]]\nIn October 21st Division went to the [[Armenti\u00e8res]] sector, where it received training in trench warfare. The BEF now instituted a policy of exchanging units between divisions to even up training levels between formations. Each of 21st Division's brigades exchanged one of its battalions with a Regular Army brigade, and on 16 November 8th EYR transferred to [[8th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|8th Bde]] in [[3rd (United Kingdom) Division|3rd Division]]. 3rd Division was composed of Regular units that had been fighting since the early days of the war. Many of the officers and men in the ranks of 3rd Division by now were replacements with no more experience than the East Yorkshires, but the staffs and support units were very experienced, and the battalion could expect its future operations to be better planned and executed. The brigade sent the battalion's companies one by one into the front line for two days each to gain experience of trench routine. It finally took responsibility for holding its own sector (near [[Voormezeele Enclosures Commonwealth War Graves Commission Cemeteries|Voormezeele]] in the [[Ypres Salient]]) on 29 December.<ref name = Becke21/><ref name = Becke3>Becke, Pt 1, pp. 49\u201355.</ref><ref name = Trail3>[http://www.longlongtrail.co.uk/army/order-of-battle-of-divisions/3rd-division/ 3rd Division at Log, Long trail.]</ref><ref>Wyrall, pp. 124\u20135.</ref>\n\n===Ypres Salient===\n[[File:RJB18_\u2013_St_Eloi.jpg|thumb|300px|left|The St Eloi craters, visible in an aerial photograph taken on 1 April 1916.]]\nIn early 1916 the 8th EYR, temporarily commanded by Acting Lt-Col F.B. Brewis, took its turn in the trenches near [[Sint-Elooi|St Eloi]]. On 2 March part of 3rd Division made a successful [[Actions of the Bluff, 1916|attack on The Bluff]] and 8th Bde relieved the attackers on the night of 3/4 March. 8th East Yorkshires took over flooded trenches in terrible condition, in a snowstorm, and had to deal with two German counter-attacks. By 6 March the effective strength of the battalion had been reduced by 55 per cent as a result of [[Trench foot]] and exposure.<ref name = Wyrall130/><ref name = Becke3/><ref name = Trail3/><ref name = Trail3/><ref>Edmonds, ''1916'', Vol I, pp. 170\u20132.</ref>\n\nOn the morning of 27 March the [[Royal Engineers]] exploded six mines under the German positions at The Mound near St Eloi and 3rd Division's [[9th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|9th Bde]] [[Actions of St Eloi Craters|attacked the craters]]. 8th Brigade was also in the line, with 8th EYR (under Lt-Col Way once more) alongside the attacking battalions. Despite the overall success, the Germans remained in possession of two of the craters and the battalion was involved in several days of shellfire and [[Grenade|bombing]] attacks among the shattered trenches. After the 8th EYR were relieved by [[31st Battalion (Alberta), CEF|31st Canadian Battalion]] on 3/4 April, the battalion's [[Lewis gun]] teams remained in the line for another week to help the Canadians, losing a number of casualties and having spent 18 consecutive days in the waterlogged positions.<ref name = Becke3/><ref name = Trail3/><ref>Edmonds, ''1916'', Vol I, pp. 180\u20136.</ref><ref>Wyrall, pp. 131\u20133.</ref>\n\n===Somme===\n8th East Yorkshires spent the following weeks alternating between resting, training, and spells in the line near [[Dikkebus|Dickebusch]], while preparations went on further south for that summer's 'Big Push' (the [[Battle of the Somme]]). The battalion entrained for the [[River Somme|Somme]] on the day the offensive began, 1 July. It went into brigade reserve when 3rd Division took over the Caterpillar Wood sector near [[Montauban]], providing carrying parties and night patrols. After the disasters of the [[First day on the Somme|first day]], 3rd Division in conjunction with three others was to make a daring night assembly and dawn attack on 13/14 July (the [[Battle of Bazentin Ridge]]). The Brigade Intelligence Officer had placed a screen of [[Picket (military)|picquet]]s and scouts out in [[No man's land]] within {{convert|200|yd|m}} of the enemy line and the assaulting troops slowly moved up in the hours of darkness to a sunken lane just short of this line. They then moved forwards 15 yards every 15 minutes until they were on their jumping-off tapes about {{convert|120|yd|m}} from the enemy by 03.15; 8th EYR was on the right of 8th Bde's line, with half of 1st [[Royal Fusiliers]] in support. At 03.20 a sudden intense bombardment was placed on the German [[Wire obstacle|barbed wire]] and trenches and five minutes later the whole attacking line of four divisions advanced behind a [[Creeping barrage]]. Along most of the line the German resistance was feeble; unfortunately the wire in front of 8th Bde was hardly touched, there were just a few breaks in the first belt and none in the second. Two platoons of the 8th EYR managed to get through on the right, the remainder had to shelter in shell holes in front of the wire or retire to the sunken road. Lieutenant-Colonel Way was wounded in the wire and Maj Brewis came up to take temporary command once more. Later a bombing party from 2nd [[Royal Scots]] came down from the left and cleared the Germans out of the trench in front of the battalion, but of the two platoons that had penetrated, no more was heard. In what was largely a successful British attack, the battalion had suffered severely, with 8 officers killed and 11 wounded, 81 other ranks killed, 218 wounded, and 141 missing, over half the initial strength of the battalion. Even when the battalion took over the opposing trenches they were heavily shelled with high explosive (HE) and [[Chemical weapons in World War I|gas]] until they were relieved on 20/21 July.<ref name = Becke3/><ref name = Trail3/><ref>Miles, ''1916'', Vol II, pp. 71\u20132, 78\u201380.</ref><ref>Wyrall, pp. 149\u201352.</ref>\n\nThe success of 14 July left the British with an awkward [[Salient (military)|salient]] south of Delville Wood, which was the scene of six more weeks' bitter fighting (the [[Battle of Delville Wood]]). On 23 July 8th Bde held this salient round Waterlot Farm while the rest of the division attacked Delville Wood. The brigade's contribution to the attack was to send out two strong bombing parties from 7th [[King's Shropshire Light Infantry]] (KSLI), supported by a company of 8th EYR, trying to clear along the railway towards [[Guillemont]] station and widen the salient. They made little progress and fell back to Waterlot Farm, their attack having been disrupted by another division falling back from an attack on Guillemont. 8th East Yorkshires' companies were now down to a strength of 40\u201350 each, but a draft of 320 reinforcements (from the Green Howards and the [[York and Lancaster Regiment]]{{efn|The K4 battalions had been converted into reserve units for the K1\u20133 battalions, so the 6th, 7th and 8th (Service) Battalions would have received their reinforcements from the 9th (Reserve) Bn, East Yorkshires, formed at [[York]] on 7 November 1914. However, as the war progressed (and particularly after the passage of the [[Military Service Act 1916]]) men could be posted to any unit. The 9th (Reserve) Bn became 7th Bn Training Reserve on 1 September 1916 and its links with the regiment ceased.<ref name = Frederick/><ref name = James/><ref name = TrailER/><ref>Wyrall, p. 402.</ref>}}) arrived that day. When relieved on 25 July the battalion consisted of 20 officers and 570 other ranks.<ref name = Becke3/><ref name = Trail3/><ref>Miles, ''1916'', Vol II, pp. 139\u201340; Sketch 17.</ref><ref>Wyrall, pp. 154\u20136.</ref>\n\n3rd Division went back into the line for a new attack on Guillemont on 17 August. Next day 8th EYR was loaned to 9th Bde for an attack during which the battalion bombers and B Company gained a footing in the German trenches but had to retire when the battalions on either side failed to get in. When it left the line on 20 August the battalion had suffered a further 6 officers wounded, 34 other ranks killed, 31 wounded and 46 missing. At the end of the month 8th EYR was holding trenches in the [[Hulluch]] sector and between 21 September and 5 October 3rd Division underwent training before moving back to the Somme.<ref>Wyrall, p. 176.</ref><ref>Miles, ''1916'', Vol II, pp. 191\u20132.</ref>\n\nThe last phase of the Somme offensive was the [[Battle of the Ancre]] on 13 November, a final attempt to secure better ground and observation points for the winter. 3rd Division's task was to repeat the attack on the village of [[Serre-l\u00e8s-Puisieux|Serre]] that had failed on the first day of the offensive, though this time it would be supported by twice as many guns. 8th Brigade attacked on the right with 8th EYR in the second line. The attacking battalions struggled through mud that was at times waist-deep, and got left behind by their protective creeping barrage. In the second line 8th EYR had the furthest to go, across {{convert|1000|yd|m}} of broken trench bridges and shell-torn ground before they reached the front. As they filed forwards, the German counter-barrage caught D Company coming up the rear. The battalion then followed the leading wave. Both waves struggled through gaps in the wire and across the German front line. Parties of all four battalions of 8th Bde reached the German support line, but could not maintain themselves there; others got mixed up in the confusion at the German front line. The whole mass of men was tumbled back to where they started. Zero hour had been at 05.45; by 06.30 it was clear at Brigade HQ that the battle was over. In the words of the ''Official History'': 'the troops of the 3rd Division ... lost the battle in the mud'. 8th East Yorkshires had lost 2 officers killed and 3 wounded, 23 other ranks killed, 177 wounded and 30 missing.<ref name = Becke3/><ref name = Trail3/><ref>Horsfall & Cave, pp. 77\u201388.</ref><ref>Miles, ''1916'', Vol II, pp. 478\u20139, 497\u20138.</ref><ref>Wyrall, pp. 176\u20137, 179\u201381, 184.</ref>\n\n===Arras===\n[[File:The_Battle_of_Arras,_April-may_1917_Q5119.jpg|thumb|300px|right|British infantry using trench bridges to cross assembly trenches as they move up in support of the initial assault at Arras on 9 April.]] \n3rd Division moved to the [[Arras]] sector in February 1917 and the 8th EYR (now commanded by Lt-Col J.N. de la Perrelle) spent several tours in the St Sauveur trenches before a short period of training for the forthcoming [[Battle of Arras (1917)|Arras Offensive]]. The battalion went into the Auckland Caves under Arras on 7 April before moving up into their assembly trenches at 02.00 on 9 April, ready for Zero hour for the [[Battle of Arras (1917)|First Battle of the Scarpe]]. In 3rd Division, [[76th Brigade (United Kingdom)|76th Bde]] was to capture the German first line, 9th Bde the second and 8th Bde the third or Brown Line. The attack began at 05.30 with a 'hurricane bombardment' by guns, mortars and machine guns, and 8th Bde moved out of their assembly trenches at 10.40 in order to pass through 9th Bde at Zero plus 6 hours (11.30). 8th East Yorkshires formed the brigade's second wave. At first all went well, and dozens of prisoners were taken, but after a while 8th EYR got caught up with the wave in front, and then the whole line was held up by machine gun crossfire short of the Brown Line. A second attempt was made at 19.00 and casualties mounted. The Germans made no counter-attack, so the brigade was ordered to launch a fresh attack on the Brown Line at 08.15 next morning, later put off until 12.00. The barrage came down at 11.45, all four battalions advanced in line, and this time the enemy fled, the whole Brown Line being captured by 12.30. The battalions held this line for two more days in snowy weather until the division was relieved in the early hours of 14 April.<ref name = Becke3/><ref name = Trail3/><ref>Falls, ''1917'', Vol I, pp. 216\u20137, 248.</ref><ref>Wyrall, pp. 205\u20138.</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Battle of Arras (1917)|Second Battle of the Scarpe]] (23\u201325 April) 8th Bde was moved up in support of 15th (S) Division and did not join the attack.<ref name = Becke3/><ref name = Trail3/><ref>Wyrall, pp. 209, 211.</ref> Again, on 28 April, although the 8th EYR 'stood to' to support [[12th (Eastern) Division]] at the [[Battle of Arras (1917)|Battle of Arleux]], it was not engaged, though it suffered a number of casualties from shellfire both before and after the attack.<ref name = Becke3/><ref name = Trail3/><ref>Wyrall, pp. 213\u20134.</ref> The [[Battle of Arras (1917)|Third Battle of the Scarpe]] on 3 May was another matter: 3rd Division had been in the line for 10 days, although the divisional commander had managed to keep 8th and 9th Bdes relatively fresh before they took over the front line trenches on 1 May. Despite attacking before dawn there was no surprise and just before Zero (03.45) the enemy guns deluged the division's front with HE and gas shells, so the men had to wear their respirators while forming up. When it attacked, 8th Brigade fell into confusion in the darkness, partly because the enemy had pushed parties of riflemen out into shell holes in No man's land where they were missed by the barrage. 8th East Yorkshires in the second wave quickly ran into 1st [[Royal Scots Fusiliers]] (RSF) in front, who were completely held up. By the end of the day the brigade held a series of outposts in No man's land. Despite its heavy casualties \u2013 6 officers killed (including the [[Military chaplain|Padre]]),{{efn|Captain (Chaplain 4th Class) Rev Charles Wand Mitchell is buried in the Faubourg d'Amiens Commonwealth War Graves Commission Cemetery, Arras.<ref>[https://www.cwgc.org/find-war-dead/casualty/574517/mitchell,-the-rev.-charles-wand/ Mitchell at CWGC.]</ref>}} one wounded, 35 other ranks killed, 161 wounded and 39 missing \u2013 8th EYR had to take over the line during the night from the even more shattered 1st RSF.

On 4 September 3rd Division moved to the Ypres Salient for intensive training to join in the fighting. They were in Corps Reserve during the [[Battle of the Menin Road Ridge]] (20\u201325 September) and then participated in the [[Battle of Polygon Wood]]. On the evening of 25 September Lt-Col de la Perrelle led 8th EYR up to their assembly positions in warm sunny weather. Zero hour was 05.50 on 26 September and 8th Bde was on the left of 8th Bde's attack on [[Zonnebeke]]. There was a morning mist and the troops had to steer by compass bearings over the devastated ground; they then found that despite the dry weather the Zonnebeke stream (not expected to be much of an obstacle) was swollen into a {{convert|30|yd|m}} wide marsh. To get round the inundation the battalion had to move to the flank, opening up a gap to the 2nd Royal Scots on their right. Nevertheless, and despite resistance from a number of [[Pillbox (military)|pillboxes]], the battalion was on its objective (the Red Line) by 07.00, having captured a number of prisoners, while four [[Corporal]]s had each captured a machine gun single-handed. The 1st RSF and 7th KSLI now leapfrogged past the 8th EYR and 2nd Royal Scots to advance towards the second objective (the Blue Line) by 10.00 (they did not quite achieve the final objective, Hill 40). The inevitable counter-attacks then began: the first was easily repulsed, the second, at 18.00, drove the leading troops back a little, but the ground was recovered. Now followed three terrible days holding the captured positions under incessant shellfire. On 27 September the Germans placed a barrage behind the frontline troops to isolate them and massed for an attack, but the SOS call to the divisional artillery broke it up. On the evening of 29 September the battalion was relieved. Its total casualties during the battle were unrecorded, but included the Padre{{efn|Captain (Chaplain 4th Class) Rev B.C.

It then returned to the line in the [[Noreuil]] sector. 3rd Division did not take part in the BEF's final effort of 1917, the [[Battle of Cambrai (1917)|Battle of Cambrai]], but it did carry out a subsidiary attack at [[Bullecourt]] on the opening day of the offensive (20 November). The battalion was in Brigade Support, and although 8th Brigade itself was kept 'standing to' throughout the day it was not engaged. The rest of the winter was spent trench-holding.<ref>Wyrall, p. 252.</ref>\n\n==Disbandment==\nBy early 1918 the BEF was experiencing a severe manpower crisis. The solution was to disband one battalion in each brigade and distribute the men to other units. As a 'New Army' battalion in a predominantly Regular Army division, 8th EYR was inevitably selected for disbandment. On 17 February it was amalgamated with 12th [[West Yorkshire Regiment]] of 9th Bde to form '''10th Entrenching Battalion'''. Entrenching battalions were used for digging defences until their men were needed as reinforcements. The 10th Battalion was broken up before the end of the year, probably drafted to reinforce units shattered in the German [[Spring Offensive]].<ref name = Frederick/><ref name = James/><ref name = TrailER/><ref name = Becke3/><ref name = Trail3/><ref>Wyrall, pp. 258\u20139.</ref><ref>[http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C4558646 'Entrenching Battalions', The National Archives (TNA), Kew, file WO 95/5494/1.]</ref> During its service, 8th EYR had lost 706 other ranks dead {{efn|The regiment's officer casualties were not listed by battalion.}}<ref>Wyrall, Appendix I.</ref>\n\nA new 8th Battalion, East Yorkshire Regiment, was formed in 1940, initially as 50th (Holding) Bn; it later converted into [[115th Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery]], and served with [[46th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|46th Division]] in the [[Tunisian Campaign|Tunisian]] and [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italian]] Campaigns.<ref name = Frederick/>\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|3}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin|2}}\n* Maj A.F.

Following a short period of training it went to the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] with other Kitchener battalions and endured a disastrous initiation at the [[Battle of Loos]]. It was then transferred to the experienced [[3rd (United Kingdom) Division|3rd Division]] and fought with it on the [[Battle of the Somme|Somme]], at [[Battle of Arras (1917)|Arras]] and [[Battle of Passchendaele|Ypres]]. After heavy casualties the battalion was disbanded early in 1918.\n\n==Recruitment and training==\n[[File:30a Sammlung Eybl Gro\u00dfbritannien.

(Slg.Nr. 552).jpg|right|thumb|[[Alfred Leete]]'s recruitment poster for Kitchener's Army.]]\nOn 6 August 1914, less than 48 hours after Britain's declaration of war, [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] sanctioned an increase of 500,000 men for the Regular [[British Army]], and the newly-appointed [[Secretary of State for War]], [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Earl Kitchener of Khartoum]] issued his famous call to arms: 'Your King and Country Need You', urging the first 100,000 volunteers to come forward. This group of six divisions with supporting arms became known as Kitchener's First New Army, or 'K1', and was quickly followed by 'K2' and 'K3' as a flood of volunteers poured into the recruiting offices and were formed into 'Service' battalions at the regimental depots. The [[East Yorkshire Regiment]] formed its third such battalion, the '''8th (Service) Battalion''', on 22 September at [[Berkhamsted]], [[Hertfordshire]], from a draft of recruits sent from the depot at [[Victoria Barracks, Beverley]].<ref>Becke, Pt 3a, pp. 2 & 8; Appendix I.</ref><ref name = Frederick>Frederick, p. 182.</ref><ref name = James>James, p. 59.</ref><ref name = Wyrall24>Wyrall, p. 24.</ref><ref name = TrailER>[http://www.longlongtrail.co.uk/army/regiments-and-corps/the-british-infantry-regiments-of-1914-1918/east-yorkshire-regiment/ East Yorkshires at Long, Long Trail.]</ref>{{efn|The second [[Pals battalion]] raised in [[Hull]], known as the 'Hull Tradesmen', was originally going to be the 8th (Hull) Bn, but this was changed to [[Hull Pals|11th (Service) Bn (2nd Hull)]].<ref>Wyrall, p. 23.</ref>}}\n[[File:British 21st Division insignia.png|thumb|200px|right|21st Division's insignia.]]\nThe new battalion was assigned to [[62nd Brigade (United Kingdom)|62nd Brigade]] in [[21st Division (United Kingdom)|21st Division]], the senior K3 division, formed from units raised in North East England, which was assembling around [[Tring]] in Hertfordshire. The men started out in [[Billet|billets]], but the division soon moved under canvas at [[RAF Halton|Halton Park]]. Throughout October drafts arrived from Beverley until on 4 November the battalion reached a strength of 25 officers and 1092 other ranks under the command of [[Lieutenant colonel (United Kingdom)|Lieutenant-Colonel]] L.C. Fryer. Mud and rain brought a return to billets for the winter, with 8th East Yorkshires housed in [[Wendover]], [[Aston Clinton]] and [[Weston Turville]].<ref name = James/><ref name = Wyrall24/><ref name = Becke21>Becke, Pt 3a, pp. 103\u20139.</ref><ref name = Trail21>[http://www.longlongtrail.co.uk/army/order-of-battle-of-divisions/21st-division/ 21st Division  at Long, Long Trail.]</ref><ref name = Edmonds1915p293>Edmonds, ''1915'', Vol II, pp. 293\u20134.</ref>\n\nHuts had been built at Halton by the time the division returned there in May 1915, and training continued. Towards the end of June the first service rifles arrived and the men began their musketry courses. This was completed by 9 August, when the infantry began moving to [[Witley Camp]] in [[Surrey]]. Although its training was still woefully inadequate (the K1 and K2 units had taken all the best instructors and staff officers), the division soon received orders to join the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]] on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]], and advance parties left at the beginning of September. 8th East Yorkshires crossed to [[Boulogne]] on 8\u20139 September under the command of Lt-Col B.I. Way ([[North Staffordshire Regiment]]). By 13 September 21st Division was concentrated west of [[Saint-Omer|St Omer]] with 8th EYR billeted in [[Moulle]]. Final training took place, in route marching, [[Grenade|bomb-throwing]], sniping, and machine-gun practice, culminating in an attack on practice trenches. Less than two weeks after arrival it was thrown into a major attack at the [[Battle of Loos]], without the men ever having visited the frontline trenches.<ref name = Becke21/><ref name = Edmonds1915p293/><ref>Wyrall, pp. 81\u20132.</ref>\n\n===Loos===\n[[File:Battle_of_Loos,_1915_png.png|thumb|300px|left|The battlefield of Loos.]]\nThe move south to Loos was achieved by a series of night marches beginning on 20/21 September, arriving at [[N\u0153ux-les-Mines]] at 23.00 on 24 September, when the men [[Bivouac shelter|bivouacked]] in open fields in heavy rain. The British attack was launched at 06.30 the following morning, and at 11.15 62nd Bde was ordered up to a concentration area north of [[Mazingarbe]]. Before the men had time to eat, orders arrived for the brigade to go up to support [[15th (Scottish) Division]], which was believed to have captured Hill 70. The brigadier selected 8th EYR and 10th [[Green Howards]] for this task. Without time for reconnaissance all he could do was point out Hill 70 on the map and tell the battalion commanders: 'We do not know what has happened on Hill 70. You must go and find out: if the Germans hold it, attack them; if our people are there, support them; if no-one is there, dig in'. As the inexperienced battalions set out (still accompanied by their transport) they were instructed by a military policeman that according to trench routine they must open out, with intervals between sections. Spacing out the columns took time, and it was 16.30 before they crossed the old front line and headed for [[Loos-en-Gohelle|Loos]]. Shortly afterwards they came in full view of German artillery, which practically destroyed the battalion transport. Instead of going through the village of Loos and north of the Loos Crassier spoil heap, the 8th Yorkshires, followed by 10th Green Howards, passed on the south side, bumping into [[20th Battalion, London Regiment (Blackheath and Woolwich)|1/20th Londons]] of [[47th (1/2nd London) Division]], which was holding part of the German positions. The CO of 1/20th Londons tried to stop the advance, but the two Yorkshire battalions carried on in extended lines towards Chalk Pit Copse, well south of Hill 70. A few minutes later they came under intense machine gun fire from the German-held part of the copse, 8th EYR and the leading companies of 10th Green Howards sustaining heavy casualties. In the confusion and gathering darkness some troops trying to retrace their steps and go through Loos were mistaken for attackers and fired upon by the rear companies of 10th Green Howards. It was 19.30 before Lt-Col Way and the CO of the Green Howards were able to restore order. 8th East Yorkshires, together with the remnants of the [[19th Battalion, London Regiment (St Pancras)|1/19th Londons]], dug in, continuing the line of 1/20th Londons over the Crassier into the outskirts of Loos village. Two companies dug communication trenches back towards the old front line, and cleared German stragglers out of Loos.<ref>Cherry, pp. 175\u20136.</ref><ref>Edmonds, ''1915'', Vol II, pp. 296\u20138.</ref><ref>Wyrall, pp. 82\u20135.</ref>\n\nThe attack on Hill 70 was renewed next morning after an hour-long bombardment. The main attack was made by 15th (S) Division, with 62nd Bde in support. As the bombardment ended Lt-Col Way led C and D Companies (about 120 men) with a few of the Londons and a few [[Northumberland Fusiliers]] towards Hill 70. The mist suddenly cleared and they were clearly visible to the German outposts on the hill. Although some men reached the enemy trenches the lines 'withered away' (in the words of the ''Official History'') and flanking fire forced them to retreat. The Crassier then came under shellfire, and snipers and machine guns caused steady casualties. While A and B Companies maintained their position on the Crassier until relieved the following afternoon, Lt-Col Way (who had been wounded) ordered the remainder back to the cover of the village and the support trenches where they joined [[23rd (County of London) Battalion, London Regiment|1/23rd Londons]] and were shelled all night. At 16.30 on 27 September the battalion went into bivouacs at [[Sailly-Labourse]] when a roll-call revealed that the battalion had lost 7 officers killed or missing and 12 wounded, 154 other ranks killed or missing and 133 wounded. Next day the battalion entrained for [[Liettres]] where it began refitting.<ref>Cherry, pp. 194\u20139.</ref><ref>Edmonds, ''1915'', Vol II, pp. 310\u20134, 342.</ref><ref>Wyrall, pp. 85\u20136.</ref>\n[[File:3rd Division WW1.svg|thumb|150px|right|3rd Division's  WWI insignia.]]\nIn October 21st Division went to the [[Armenti\u00e8res]] sector, where it received training in trench warfare. The BEF now instituted a policy of exchanging units between divisions to even up training levels between formations. Each of 21st Division's brigades exchanged one of its battalions with a Regular Army brigade, and on 16 November 8th EYR transferred to [[8th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|8th Bde]] in [[3rd (United Kingdom) Division|3rd Division]]. 3rd Division was composed of Regular units that had been fighting since the early days of the war. Many of the officers and men in the ranks of 3rd Division by now were replacements with no more experience than the East Yorkshires, but the staffs and support units were very experienced, and the battalion could expect its future operations to be better planned and executed. The brigade sent the battalion's companies one by one into the front line for two days each to gain experience of trench routine. It finally took responsibility for holding its own sector (near [[Voormezeele Enclosures Commonwealth War Graves Commission Cemeteries|Voormezeele]] in the [[Ypres Salient]]) on 29 December.<ref name = Becke21/><ref name = Becke3>Becke, Pt 1, pp. 49\u201355.</ref><ref name = Trail3>[http://www.longlongtrail.co.uk/army/order-of-battle-of-divisions/3rd-division/ 3rd Division at Log, Long trail.]</ref><ref>Wyrall, pp. 124\u20135.</ref>\n\n===Ypres Salient===\n[[File:RJB18_\u2013_St_Eloi.jpg|thumb|300px|left|The St Eloi craters, visible in an aerial photograph taken on 1 April 1916.]]\nIn early 1916 the 8th EYR, temporarily commanded by Acting Lt-Col F.B. Brewis, took its turn in the trenches near [[Sint-Elooi|St Eloi]]. On 2 March part of 3rd Division made a successful [[Actions of the Bluff, 1916|attack on The Bluff]] and 8th Bde relieved the attackers on the night of 3/4 March. 8th East Yorkshires took over flooded trenches in terrible condition, in a snowstorm, and had to deal with two German counter-attacks. By 6 March the effective strength of the battalion had been reduced by 55 per cent as a result of [[Trench foot]] and exposure.<ref name = Wyrall130/><ref name = Becke3/><ref name = Trail3/><ref name = Trail3/><ref>Edmonds, ''1916'', Vol I, pp. 170\u20132.</ref>\n\nOn the morning of 27 March the [[Royal Engineers]] exploded six mines under the German positions at The Mound near St Eloi and 3rd Division's [[9th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|9th Bde]] [[Actions of St Eloi Craters|attacked the craters]]. 8th Brigade was also in the line, with 8th EYR (under Lt-Col Way once more) alongside the attacking battalions. Despite the overall success, the Germans remained in possession of two of the craters and the battalion was involved in several days of shellfire and [[Grenade|bombing]] attacks among the shattered trenches. After the 8th EYR were relieved by [[31st Battalion (Alberta), CEF|31st Canadian Battalion]] on 3/4 April, the battalion's [[Lewis gun]] teams remained in the line for another week to help the Canadians, losing a number of casualties and having spent 18 consecutive days in the waterlogged positions.<ref name = Becke3/><ref name = Trail3/><ref>Edmonds, ''1916'', Vol I, pp. 180\u20136.</ref><ref>Wyrall, pp. 131\u20133.</ref>\n\n===Somme===\n8th East Yorkshires spent the following weeks alternating between resting, training, and spells in the line near [[Dikkebus|Dickebusch]], while preparations went on further south for that summer's 'Big Push' (the [[Battle of the Somme]]). The battalion entrained for the [[River Somme|Somme]] on the day the offensive began, 1 July. It went into brigade reserve when 3rd Division took over the Caterpillar Wood sector near [[Montauban]], providing carrying parties and night patrols. After the disasters of the [[First day on the Somme|first day]], 3rd Division in conjunction with three others was to make a daring night assembly and dawn attack on 13/14 July (the [[Battle of Bazentin Ridge]]). The Brigade Intelligence Officer had placed a screen of [[Picket (military)|picquet]]s and scouts out in [[No man's land]] within {{convert|200|yd|m}} of the enemy line and the assaulting troops slowly moved up in the hours of darkness to a sunken lane just short of this line. They then moved forwards 15 yards every 15 minutes until they were on their jumping-off tapes about {{convert|120|yd|m}} from the enemy by 03.15; 8th EYR was on the right of 8th Bde's line, with half of 1st [[Royal Fusiliers]] in support. At 03.20 a sudden intense bombardment was placed on the German [[Wire obstacle|barbed wire]] and trenches and five minutes later the whole attacking line of four divisions advanced behind a [[Creeping barrage]]. Along most of the line the German resistance was feeble; unfortunately the wire in front of 8th Bde was hardly touched, there were just a few breaks in the first belt and none in the second. Two platoons of the 8th EYR managed to get through on the right, the remainder had to shelter in shell holes in front of the wire or retire to the sunken road. Lieutenant-Colonel Way was wounded in the wire and Maj Brewis came up to take temporary command once more. Later a bombing party from 2nd [[Royal Scots]] came down from the left and cleared the Germans out of the trench in front of the battalion, but of the two platoons that had penetrated, no more was heard. In what was largely a successful British attack, the battalion had suffered severely, with 8 officers killed and 11 wounded, 81 other ranks killed, 218 wounded, and 141 missing, over half the initial strength of the battalion. Even when the battalion took over the opposing trenches they were heavily shelled with high explosive (HE) and [[Chemical weapons in World War I|gas]] until they were relieved on 20/21 July.<ref name = Becke3/><ref name = Trail3/><ref>Miles, ''1916'', Vol II, pp. 71\u20132, 78\u201380.</ref><ref>Wyrall, pp. 149\u201352.</ref>\n\nThe success of 14 July left the British with an awkward [[Salient (military)|salient]] south of Delville Wood, which was the scene of six more weeks' bitter fighting (the [[Battle of Delville Wood]]). On 23 July 8th Bde held this salient round Waterlot Farm while the rest of the division attacked Delville Wood. The brigade's contribution to the attack was to send out two strong bombing parties from 7th [[King's Shropshire Light Infantry]] (KSLI), supported by a company of 8th EYR, trying to clear along the railway towards [[Guillemont]] station and widen the salient. They made little progress and fell back to Waterlot Farm, their attack having been disrupted by another division falling back from an attack on Guillemont. 8th East Yorkshires' companies were now down to a strength of 40\u201350 each, but a draft of 320 reinforcements (from the Green Howards and the [[York and Lancaster Regiment]]{{efn|The K4 battalions had been converted into reserve units for the K1\u20133 battalions, so the 6th, 7th and 8th (Service) Battalions would have received their reinforcements from the 9th (Reserve) Bn, East Yorkshires, formed at [[York]] on 7 November 1914. However, as the war progressed (and particularly after the passage of the [[Military Service Act 1916]]) men could be posted to any unit. The 9th (Reserve) Bn became 7th Bn Training Reserve on 1 September 1916 and its links with the regiment ceased.<ref name = Frederick/><ref name = James/><ref name = TrailER/><ref>Wyrall, p. 402.</ref>}}) arrived that day. When relieved on 25 July the battalion consisted of 20 officers and 570 other ranks.<ref name = Becke3/><ref name = Trail3/><ref>Miles, ''1916'', Vol II, pp. 139\u201340; Sketch 17.</ref><ref>Wyrall, pp. 154\u20136.</ref>\n\n3rd Division went back into the line for a new attack on Guillemont on 17 August. Next day 8th EYR was loaned to 9th Bde for an attack during which the battalion bombers and B Company gained a footing in the German trenches but had to retire when the battalions on either side failed to get in. When it left the line on 20 August the battalion had suffered a further 6 officers wounded, 34 other ranks killed, 31 wounded and 46 missing. At the end of the month 8th EYR was holding trenches in the [[Hulluch]] sector and between 21 September and 5 October 3rd Division underwent training before moving back to the Somme.<ref>Wyrall, p. 176.</ref><ref>Miles, ''1916'', Vol II, pp. 191\u20132.</ref>\n\nThe last phase of the Somme offensive was the [[Battle of the Ancre]] on 13 November, a final attempt to secure better ground and observation points for the winter. 3rd Division's task was to repeat the attack on the village of [[Serre-l\u00e8s-Puisieux|Serre]] that had failed on the first day of the offensive, though this time it would be supported by twice as many guns. 8th Brigade attacked on the right with 8th EYR in the second line. The attacking battalions struggled through mud that was at times waist-deep, and got left behind by their protective creeping barrage. In the second line 8th EYR had the furthest to go, across {{convert|1000|yd|m}} of broken trench bridges and shell-torn ground before they reached the front. As they filed forwards, the German counter-barrage caught D Company coming up the rear. The battalion then followed the leading wave. Both waves struggled through gaps in the wire and across the German front line. Parties of all four battalions of 8th Bde reached the German support line, but could not maintain themselves there; others got mixed up in the confusion at the German front line. The whole mass of men was tumbled back to where they started. Zero hour had been at 05.45; by 06.30 it was clear at Brigade HQ that the battle was over. In the words of the ''Official History'': 'the troops of the 3rd Division ... lost the battle in the mud'. 8th East Yorkshires had lost 2 officers killed and 3 wounded, 23 other ranks killed, 177 wounded and 30 missing.<ref name = Becke3/><ref name = Trail3/><ref>Horsfall & Cave, pp. 77\u201388.</ref><ref>Miles, ''1916'', Vol II, pp. 478\u20139, 497\u20138.</ref><ref>Wyrall, pp. 176\u20137, 179\u201381, 184.</ref>\n\n===Arras===\n[[File:The_Battle_of_Arras,_April-may_1917_Q5119.jpg|thumb|300px|right|British infantry using trench bridges to cross assembly trenches as they move up in support of the initial assault at Arras on 9 April.]] \n3rd Division moved to the [[Arras]] sector in February 1917 and the 8th EYR (now commanded by Lt-Col J.N. de la Perrelle) spent several tours in the St Sauveur trenches before a short period of training for the forthcoming [[Battle of Arras (1917)|Arras Offensive]]. The battalion went into the Auckland Caves under Arras on 7 April before moving up into their assembly trenches at 02.00 on 9 April, ready for Zero hour for the [[Battle of Arras (1917)|First Battle of the Scarpe]]. In 3rd Division, [[76th Brigade (United Kingdom)|76th Bde]] was to capture the German first line, 9th Bde the second and 8th Bde the third or Brown Line. The attack began at 05.30 with a 'hurricane bombardment' by guns, mortars and machine guns, and 8th Bde moved out of their assembly trenches at 10.40 in order to pass through 9th Bde at Zero plus 6 hours (11.30). 8th East Yorkshires formed the brigade's second wave. At first all went well, and dozens of prisoners were taken, but after a while 8th EYR got caught up with the wave in front, and then the whole line was held up by machine gun crossfire short of the Brown Line. A second attempt was made at 19.00 and casualties mounted. The Germans made no counter-attack, so the brigade was ordered to launch a fresh attack on the Brown Line at 08.15 next morning, later put off until 12.00. The barrage came down at 11.45, all four battalions advanced in line, and this time the enemy fled, the whole Brown Line being captured by 12.30. The battalions held this line for two more days in snowy weather until the division was relieved in the early hours of 14 April.<ref name = Becke3/><ref name = Trail3/><ref>Falls, ''1917'', Vol I, pp. 216\u20137, 248.</ref><ref>Wyrall, pp. 205\u20138.</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Battle of Arras (1917)|Second Battle of the Scarpe]] (23\u201325 April) 8th Bde was moved up in support of 15th (S) Division and did not join the attack.<ref name = Becke3/><ref name = Trail3/><ref>Wyrall, pp. 209, 211.</ref> Again, on 28 April, although the 8th EYR 'stood to' to support [[12th (Eastern) Division]] at the [[Battle of Arras (1917)|Battle of Arleux]], it was not engaged, though it suffered a number of casualties from shellfire both before and after the attack.<ref name = Becke3/><ref name = Trail3/><ref>Wyrall, pp. 213\u20134.</ref> The [[Battle of Arras (1917)|Third Battle of the Scarpe]] on 3 May was another matter: 3rd Division had been in the line for 10 days, although the divisional commander had managed to keep 8th and 9th Bdes relatively fresh before they took over the front line trenches on 1 May. Despite attacking before dawn there was no surprise and just before Zero (03.45) the enemy guns deluged the division's front with HE and gas shells, so the men had to wear their respirators while forming up. When it attacked, 8th Brigade fell into confusion in the darkness, partly because the enemy had pushed parties of riflemen out into shell holes in No man's land where they were missed by the barrage. 8th East Yorkshires in the second wave quickly ran into 1st [[Royal Scots Fusiliers]] (RSF) in front, who were completely held up. By the end of the day the brigade held a series of outposts in No man's land. Despite its heavy casualties \u2013 6 officers killed (including the [[Military chaplain|Padre]]),{{efn|Captain (Chaplain 4th Class) Rev Charles Wand Mitchell is buried in the Faubourg d'Amiens Commonwealth War Graves Commission Cemetery, Arras.<ref>[https://www.cwgc.org/find-war-dead/casualty/574517/mitchell,-the-rev.-charles-wand/ Mitchell at CWGC.]</ref>}} one wounded, 35 other ranks killed, 161 wounded and 39 missing \u2013 8th EYR had to take over the line during the night from the even more shattered 1st RSF. Although the battalion was ordered to reorganise to continue the operations, both sides spent 4 May collecting wounded under [[Red Cross]] flags.

On 4 September 3rd Division moved to the Ypres Salient for intensive training to join in the fighting. They were in Corps Reserve during the [[Battle of the Menin Road Ridge]] (20\u201325 September) and then participated in the [[Battle of Polygon Wood]]. On the evening of 25 September Lt-Col de la Perrelle led 8th EYR up to their assembly positions in warm sunny weather. Zero hour was 05.50 on 26 September and 8th Bde was on the left of 8th Bde's attack on [[Zonnebeke]]. There was a morning mist and the troops had to steer by compass bearings over the devastated ground; they then found that despite the dry weather the Zonnebeke stream (not expected to be much of an obstacle) was swollen into a {{convert|30|yd|m}} wide marsh. To get round the inundation the battalion had to move to the flank, opening up a gap to the 2nd Royal Scots on their right. Nevertheless, and despite resistance from a number of [[Pillbox (military)|pillboxes]], the battalion was on its objective (the Red Line) by 07.00, having captured a number of prisoners, while four [[Corporal]]s had each captured a machine gun single-handed. The 1st RSF and 7th KSLI now leapfrogged past the 8th EYR and 2nd Royal Scots to advance towards the second objective (the Blue Line) by 10.00 (they did not quite achieve the final objective, Hill 40). The inevitable counter-attacks then began: the first was easily repulsed, the second, at 18.00, drove the leading troops back a little, but the ground was recovered. Now followed three terrible days holding the captured positions under incessant shellfire. On 27 September the Germans placed a barrage behind the frontline troops to isolate them and massed for an attack, but the SOS call to the divisional artillery broke it up. On the evening of 29 September the battalion was relieved. Its total casualties during the battle were unrecorded, but included the Padre{{efn|Captain (Chaplain 4th Class) Rev B.C.

It then returned to the line in the [[Noreuil]] sector. 3rd Division did not take part in the BEF's final effort of 1917, the [[Battle of Cambrai (1917)|Battle of Cambrai]], but it did carry out a subsidiary attack at [[Bullecourt]] on the opening day of the offensive (20 November). The battalion was in Brigade Support, and although 8th Brigade itself was kept 'standing to' throughout the day it was not engaged. The rest of the winter was spent trench-holding.<ref>Wyrall, p. 252.</ref>\n\n==Disbandment==\nBy early 1918 the BEF was experiencing a severe manpower crisis. The solution was to disband one battalion in each brigade and distribute the men to other units. As a 'New Army' battalion in a predominantly Regular Army division, 8th EYR was inevitably selected for disbandment. On 17 February it was amalgamated with 12th [[West Yorkshire Regiment]] of 9th Bde to form '''10th Entrenching Battalion'''. Entrenching battalions were used for digging defences until their men were needed as reinforcements. The 10th Battalion was broken up before the end of the year, probably drafted to reinforce units shattered in the German [[Spring Offensive]].<ref name = Frederick/><ref name = James/><ref name = TrailER/><ref name = Becke3/><ref name = Trail3/><ref>Wyrall, pp. 258\u20139.</ref><ref>[http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C4558646 'Entrenching Battalions', The National Archives (TNA), Kew, file WO 95/5494/1.]</ref> During its service, 8th EYR had lost 706 other ranks dead {{efn|The regiment's officer casualties were not listed by battalion.}}<ref>Wyrall, Appendix I.</ref>\n\nA new 8th Battalion, East Yorkshire Regiment, was formed in 1940, initially as 50th (Holding) Bn; it later converted into [[115th Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery]], and served with [[46th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|46th Division]] in the [[Tunisian Campaign|Tunisian]] and [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italian]] Campaigns.<ref name = Frederick/>\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|3}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin|2}}\n* Maj A.F.

{"title_page": "1913 Auckland Rugby League season", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2020}}\n{{Cleanup|reason=drop caps as per [[MOS:HEADINGS]]|date=April 2020}}\nThe 1913 [[Auckland Rugby League]] season was the 5th season of the Auckland Rugby league. It followed the [[1912 Auckland Rugby League season]].\n\nThe first grade competition began on 3 May with the same 6 teams that had competed in the 1912 season, however [[Manukau Magpies|Manukau Rovers]] pulled out of the competition midway through the season as they struggled to put a full team on the field. The Eden Ramblers also pulled out at the same time. [[North Shore Albions]] were crowned champions for the first time.\n\nOther clubs competing in lower grades were [[Otahuhu Leopards|Otahuhu]], [[Northcote Tigers|Northcote Ramblers]] now known as the Northcote Tigers, and [[Ellerslie Eagles|Ellerslie Wanderers]], who later became known as the Ellerslie Eagles. A match was also played between Avondale and New Lynn in [[Avondale, Auckland|Avondale]] on 13 September. The match was won by New Lynn by 23 points to 8.\n\n===Switching Codes===\n[[Karl Ifwersen]] switched from rugby union where he had been playing in Auckland and made his debut appearance for [[North Shore Albions]]. He was to go on to have a remarkable rugby league career and his scoring feats were un-rivalled through the 1910s in Auckland rugby league. While New Zealand representatives [[Graham Cook]] and [[Cecil King (rugby league)|Cecil King]] had moved from Wellington and made debut appearances for [[Newton Rangers]].\n\n===Charles Savory Controversy===\nIn a match involving Ponsonby and Manukau in Onehunga, [[Charles Savory]] was accused of kicking an opponent. The incident was not seen by the referee but an [[Auckland Rugby League]] official claimed to have seen it and as a result Savory was banned for life by Auckland Rugby League. Savory had been selected to play for New Zealand on their tour of Australia and as a result of the ban was unable to make the trip. When the evidence was presented to New Zealand League they said that the evidence was not sufficient to justify the penalty and refused to confirm it. Auckland Rugby League then decided to strike Savory off the list of registered players thus making him ineligible to play in Auckland. Auckland selector [[Ronald MacDonald (rugby league)|Ronald MacDonald]] chose Savory to play against Wellington in their match on 23 August but was told at an Auckland Rugby League meeting that he was ineligible and they questioned why he had chosen him to play. MacDonald replied \"one reason is because he is one of the best forwards in the Dominion. What was he suspended for?\". A lengthy discussion followed and MacDonald refused to withdraw Savory's name from selection and a motion was then passed that MacDonald be removed from his position as Auckland selector. This was carried unanimously with Mr Angus Campbell appointed selector, and [[Morgan Hayward]] chosen to replace Savory in the side for the match with Wellington.<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Football Resentment/League Selector Replaced/\"Savory Shall Not Play\"\n| page =7\n| work=[[Auckland Star]]| volume=XLIV| issue=199\n| date = 1913-08-21\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19130821.2.87\n| accessdate = 2019-12-27}}</ref>\n\n===Death of a Player===\nTragedy struck in May in a 3rd grade match between [[Ellerslie Eagles|Ellerslie]] and [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby]] when 26 year old Adolphus Theodore Bust was killed. The death occurred at Ellerslie. He was said to have collided with an opposing player and the two of them fell to the ground with a third player falling on top of them. The other two men rose to their feet to carry on playing but Bust remained stationary on the ground. Dr. Baber was called to attend from his residence in Remuera but he found that Bust's spinal cord was fractured near the base of the skull and he recommended he be taken to hospital however Bust's father decided to have him taken to his home in Ellerslie. He was unable to be revived and died at 8.30am the following morning.<ref>{{cite news\n| title =A Footballers Death/Spinal Cord Fractured/Accident at Ellerslie\n| page =5\n| work=[[Auckland Star]]| volume=XLIV| issue=124\n| date = 1913-05-26\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19130526.2.59\n| accessdate = 2019-12-27}}</ref> After the incident the deceased father said he witnessed the incident and was satisfied that it was an accident. Martin Ellis, the player involved in the tackle said that he was running down the field and Bust was waiting to tackle him and had dived and caught Ellis by the legs but his neck struck him on the hip and they both fell to the ground. The coroner returned the verdict that nobody was to blame for the death.<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Killed at Football\n| page =8\n| work=[[Auckland Star]]| volume=XLIV| issue=125\n| date =

"text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2020}}\n{{Cleanup|reason=drop caps as per [[MOS:HEADINGS]]|date=April 2020}}\nThe 1913 [[Auckland Rugby League]] season was the 5th season of the Auckland Rugby league. It followed the [[1912 Auckland Rugby League season]].\n\nThe first grade competition began on 3 May with the same 6 teams that had competed in the 1912 season, however [[Manukau Magpies|Manukau Rovers]] pulled out of the competition midway through the season as they struggled to put a full team on the field. The Eden Ramblers also pulled out at the same time. [[North Shore Albions]] were crowned champions for the first time.\n\nOther clubs competing in lower grades were [[Otahuhu Leopards|Otahuhu]], [[Northcote Tigers|Northcote Ramblers]] now known as the Northcote Tigers, and [[Ellerslie Eagles|Ellerslie Wanderers]], who later became known as the Ellerslie Eagles. A match was also played between Avondale and New Lynn in [[Avondale, Auckland|Avondale]] on 13 September. The match was won by New Lynn by 23 points to 8.\n\n===Charles Savory Controversy===\nIn a match involving Ponsonby and Manukau in Onehunga, [[Charles Savory]] was accused of kicking an opponent. The incident was not seen by the referee but an [[Auckland Rugby League]] official claimed to have seen it and as a result Savory was banned for life by Auckland Rugby League. Savory had been selected to play for New Zealand on their tour of Australia and as a result of the ban was unable to make the trip. When the evidence was presented to New Zealand League they said that the evidence was not sufficient to justify the penalty and refused to confirm it. Auckland Rugby League then decided to strike Savory off the list of registered players thus making him ineligible to play in Auckland. Auckland selector [[Ronald MacDonald (rugby league)|Ronald MacDonald]] chose Savory to play against Wellington in their match on 23 August but was told at an Auckland Rugby League meeting that he was ineligible and they questioned why he had chosen him to play. MacDonald replied \"one reason is because he is one of the best forwards in the Dominion. What was he suspended for?\". A lengthy discussion followed and MacDonald refused to withdraw Savory's name from selection and a motion was then passed that MacDonald be removed from his position as Auckland selector. This was carried unanimously with Mr Angus Campbell appointed selector, and [[Morgan Hayward]] chosen to replace Savory in the side for the match with Wellington.<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Football Resentment/League Selector Replaced/\"Savory Shall Not Play\"\n| page =7\n| work=[[Auckland Star]]| volume=XLIV| issue=199\n| date = 1913-08-21\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19130821.2.87\n| accessdate = 2019-12-27}}</ref>\n\n===Death of a Player===\nTragedy struck in May in a 3rd grade match between [[Ellerslie Eagles|Ellerslie]] and [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby]] when 26 year old Adolphus Theodore Bust was killed. The death occurred at Ellerslie. He was said to have collided with an opposing player and the two of them fell to the ground with a third player falling on top of them. The other two men rose to their feet to carry on playing but Bust remained stationary on the ground. Dr. Baber was called to attend from his residence in Remuera but he found that Bust's spinal cord was fractured near the base of the skull and he recommended he be taken to hospital however Bust's father decided to have him taken to his home in Ellerslie. He was unable to be revived and died at 8.30am the following morning.<ref>{{cite news\n| title =A Footballers Death/Spinal Cord Fractured/Accident at Ellerslie\n| page =5\n| work=[[Auckland Star]]| volume=XLIV| issue=124\n| date = 1913-05-26\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19130526.2.59\n| accessdate = 2019-12-27}}</ref> After the incident the deceased father said he witnessed the incident and was satisfied that it was an accident. Martin Ellis, the player involved in the tackle said that he was running down the field and Bust was waiting to tackle him and had dived and caught Ellis by the legs but his neck struck him on the hip and they both fell to the ground. The coroner returned the verdict that nobody was to blame for the death.<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Killed at Football\n| page =8\n| work=[[Auckland Star]]| volume=XLIV| issue=125\n| date = 1913-05-27\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19130527.2.86\n| accessdate = 2019-12-27}}</ref>\n\n{{s-start}}\n        {{s-bef|before=[[1912 Auckland Rugby League season|1912]]}}\n        {{s-ttl|title=5th [[Auckland Rugby League]] season\n        |years=\t1913}}\n        {{s-aft|after=[[1914 Auckland Rugby League season|1914]]}}\n        {{end}}\n{{TOC right}}\n\n==Myers Cup (First Grade Competition)==\nEighteen regular season matches were played before [[North Shore Albions]] were awarded the title.\n\n===Final Standings===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!width=175 |Team\n!width=20 abbr=\"Played\" |Pld\n!width=20 abbr=\"Won\" |W\n!width=20 abbr=\"Drawn\" |D\n!width=20 abbr=\"Lost\" |L\n!width=20 abbr=\"For\" |F\n!width=20 abbr=\"Against\" |A\n!width=20 abbr=\"Points\" |Pts\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[North Shore Albions]]\n|7||5||1||1||80||55||'''11'''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[Newton Rangers]]\n|7||4||0||3||117||53||'''8'''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[City Rovers]]\n|7||3||2||2||60||46||'''8'''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[Ponsonby RFC|Ponsonby United]]\n|7||4||0||3||103||65||'''8'''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[Eden Ramblers]]\n|5||1||0||4||18||124||'''2'''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[Manukau Magpies|Manukau Rovers]]\n|5||0||1||4||21||56||'''1'''\n|-\n|}\n\n===Myers Cup Fixtures===\n======Round 1======\n[[Karl Ifwersen]] had switched codes and made his debut appearance for North Shore.
