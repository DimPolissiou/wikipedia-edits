The announcement of Gmail was written in an unserious jokey language normally seen in April Fools' jokes, tricking many into thinking that it was an April Fools' joke.

According to the company, this beverage would optimize one's use of the Google [[search engine]] by increasing the drinker's [[intelligence]]. It was claimed this boost was achieved through real-time analysis of the user's [[DNA]] and carefully tailored adjustments to [[neurotransmitter]]s in the brain (a patented technology termed '''Auto-Drink'''; as the \"Google Gulp FAQ\" suggests, partly through [[Monoamine oxidase inhibitor|MAO inhibition]]). The drink was said to come in \"4 great flavors\": '''Glutamate Grape''' ([[glutamic acid]]), '''Sugar Radical''' ([[Radical (chemistry)|free radicals]]), '''Beta Carotty''' ([[Beta-Carotene]]), and  '''Sero-Tonic Water''' ([[serotonin]]).<ref>{{cite web|title=Google hoax's|url=http://www.elevatelocal.co.uk/blog/a-history-of-googles-hoaxes-26015978|publisher=Elevatelocal}}</ref>\n\nThis hoax was probably intended as a [[parody]] of Google's then invite-only email service called [[Gmail]]. Although ostensibly free, the company claimed the beverage could only be obtained by returning the cap of a Google Gulp [[bottle]] to a local [[grocery store]]: a [[Catch-22_(logic)|Catch-22]]. In the Google Gulp [[FAQ]], Google replies to the observation \"I mean, isn't this whole invite-only thing kind of bogus?\" by saying \"Dude, it's like you've never even ''heard'' of [[viral marketing]].\"\n* Google Gulp<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/googlegulp/ |title=Google Gulp |publisher=Google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-10}}</ref>\n* Google Gulp FAQ<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/googlegulp/faq.html|title=Google Gulp|last=|first=|date=|work=google.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-02-03}}</ref>\n\n\n== 2006 ==\n[[File:GRomance.png|thumb|Google Romance logo]]\n\nOn April Fool's Day 2006, Google Romance was announced on the main Google search page with the introduction, \"Dating is a search problem.

A [[parody]] of [[online dating]], it had a link for \"those who generally favor the 'throw enough stuff at the wall' approach to online dating\" to ''Post multiple profiles with a bulk upload file, you sleaze'' in addition to ''Post your Google Romance profile''. Clicking on either of these gave an error page, which explained that it was an April Fool's joke and included links to previous April Fool's jokes.\n* Google Romance<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/romance/ |title=Google Romance |publisher=Google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-10}}</ref>\n* Google Romance FAQ<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/onceuponatime/romance/faq.html |accessdate=July 3, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105075600/https://www.google.com/onceuponatime/romance/faq.html|title=Google romance|archivedate=November 5, 2012 }}</ref>\n* Google Romance Tour<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/onceuponatime/romance/tour.html|title=Google romance|accessdate=July 3, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105080401/https://www.google.com/onceuponatime/romance/tour.html |archivedate=November 5, 2012 }}</ref>\n\n== 2007 ==\n\n=== Gmail Paper ===\nAt about 10:00&nbsp;pm, Pacific time (where Google has its headquarters) on March 30, 2007, Google changed the login page for Gmail to announce a new service called Gmail Paper. The service offered to allow users of Google's [[Gmail|free webmail service]] to add e-mails to a \"Paper Archive\", which Google would print (on \"94% post-consumer organic soybean [[sputum]]\") and mail via traditional post. The service would be free, supported by bold, red advertisements printed on the back of the printed messages. Image attachments would also be printed on high-quality glossy paper, though MP3 and [[WAV]] files would not be printed. The page detailing more information about the service features photographs of Ian Spiro and Carrie Kemper, current employees of Google. Also featured are Product Marketing Managers of Gmail Anna-Christina Douglas, and Shane Lawrence.\n* Gmail Paper Index<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mail.google.com/mail/help/paper/index.html |title=Welcome to Gmail |publisher=Mail.google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-10}}</ref>\n* Gmail Paper Announcement<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mail.google.com/mail/help/paper/more.html |title=About Gmail Paper |publisher=Mail.google.com |accessdate=2013-09-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20080315144610/http://mail.google.com/mail/help/paper/more.html |archivedate=2008-03-15 }}</ref>\n* Gmail Paper Program Policies<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mail.google.com/mail/help/paper/policies.html |title=About Gmail Paper |publisher=Mail.google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-10}}</ref>\n\n=== Google TiSP === <!-- [[Google Maps] and [[Google goal]] redirect here. -->\n'''Google TiSP''' (short for '''Top Interesting Served Provided Landscape''') was a fictitious free broadband service supposedly released by Google. This service would make use of a standard toilet and [[sewage]] lines to provide free Internet connectivity at a speed of 8&nbsp;Mbit/s (2&nbsp;Mbit/s upload) (or up to 32&nbsp;Mbit/s with a paid plan). The user would drop a weighted end of a long, Google-supplied fiber-optic cable in their toilet and flush it. Around 60&nbsp;minutes later, the end would be recovered and connected to the Internet by a \"Plumbing Hardware Dispatcher (PHD)\". The user would then connect their end to a Google-supplied wireless router and run the Google-supplied installation media on a [[Windows XP]] or [[Windows Vista]] computer (\"Mac and Linux support coming soon\"). Alternatively, a user could request a professional installation, in which Google would deploy [[nanobot]]s through the plumbing to complete the process. The free service would be supported by \"discreet [[DNA sequencing]]\" of \"personal bodily output\" to display online ads that relate to culinary preferences and personal health. Google also referenced the [[Diet Coke and Mentos eruption|diet coke-and-Mentos reaction]] in their FAQ: \"If you're still experiencing problems, drop eight mints into the bowl and add a two-liter bottle of diet soda.\" They also claim that Enterprise plans will include support in the event of backup problems, brownouts and data wipes.\n* Google TiSP<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/tisp/ |title=Welcome to Google TiSP |publisher=Google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-10}}</ref>\n* Google TiSP FAQ<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/tisp/faq.html |title=Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=Google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-10}}</ref>\n* Installation page<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/tisp/install.html |title=How TiSP Works |publisher=Google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-10}}</ref>\n* Press Release page<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/tisp/press.html |title=Google Press Center: Press Release |publisher=Google.com |date=2007-04-01 |accessdate=2013-09-10}}</ref>\n* Not found page \u2013 April fools version<ref name=\"google7\">{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/tisp/notfound.html|title=404 Not Found|website=Google.com|publisher=[[Google]]|accessdate=14 January 2014}}</ref>\n\n== 2008 ==\n<!--List subsections in alphabetic order-->\n\n=== Blogger \"Google Weblogs (beta)\" ===\nThe Blogger dashboard featured an announcement for Google Weblogs, or \"GWeblogs,\" or \"Gblogs,\" the next revolution in personal publishing.

It was claimed this boost was achieved through real-time analysis of the user's [[DNA]] and carefully tailored adjustments to [[neurotransmitter]]s in the brain (a patented technology termed '''Auto-Drink'''; as the \"Google Gulp FAQ\" suggests, partly through [[Monoamine oxidase inhibitor|MAO inhibition]]). The drink was said to come in \"4 great flavors\": '''Glutamate Grape''' ([[glutamic acid]]), '''Sugar Radical''' ([[Radical (chemistry)|free radicals]]), '''Beta Carotty''' ([[Beta-Carotene]]), and  '''Sero-Tonic Water''' ([[serotonin]]).<ref>{{cite web|title=Google hoax's|url=http://www.elevatelocal.co.uk/blog/a-history-of-googles-hoaxes-26015978|publisher=Elevatelocal}}</ref>\n\nThis hoax was probably intended as a [[parody]] of Google's then invite-only email service called [[Gmail]].

The service would be free, supported by bold, red advertisements printed on the back of the printed messages.

This service would make use of a standard toilet and [[sewage]] lines to provide free Internet connectivity at a speed of 8&nbsp;Mbit/s (2&nbsp;Mbit/s upload) (or up to 32&nbsp;Mbit/s with a paid plan). The user would drop a weighted end of a long, Google-supplied fiber-optic cable in their toilet and flush it. Around 60&nbsp;minutes later, the end would be recovered and connected to the Internet by a \"Plumbing Hardware Dispatcher (PHD)\". The user would then connect their end to a Google-supplied wireless router and run the Google-supplied installation media on a [[Windows XP]] or [[Windows Vista]] computer (\"Mac and Linux support coming soon\"). Alternatively, a user could request a professional installation, in which Google would deploy [[nanobot]]s through the plumbing to complete the process. The free service would be supported by \"discreet [[DNA sequencing]]\" of \"personal bodily output\" to display online ads that relate to culinary preferences and personal health. Google also referenced the [[Diet Coke and Mentos eruption|diet coke-and-Mentos reaction]] in their FAQ: \"If you're still experiencing problems, drop eight mints into the bowl and add a two-liter bottle of diet soda.\" They also claim that Enterprise plans will include support in the event of backup problems, brownouts and data wipes.\n* Google TiSP<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/tisp/ |title=Welcome to Google TiSP |publisher=Google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-10}}</ref>\n* Google TiSP FAQ<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/tisp/faq.html |title=Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=Google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-10}}</ref>\n* Installation page<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/tisp/install.html |title=How TiSP Works |publisher=Google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-10}}</ref>\n* Press Release page<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/tisp/press.html |title=Google Press Center: Press Release |publisher=Google.com |date=2007-04-01 |accessdate=2013-09-10}}</ref>\n* Not found page \u2013 April fools version<ref name=\"google7\">{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/tisp/notfound.html|title=404 Not Found|website=Google.com|publisher=[[Google]]|accessdate=14 January 2014}}</ref>\n\n== 2008 ==\n<!--List subsections in alphabetic order-->\n\n=== Blogger \"Google Weblogs (beta)\" ===\nThe Blogger dashboard featured an announcement for Google Weblogs, or \"GWeblogs,\" or \"Gblogs,\" the next revolution in personal publishing.

{"title_page": "Husband", "text_new": "{{Other uses}}\n{{Refimprove|date=December 2017}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2013}}\n{{Close Relationships}}\n[[Image:Bride-groom-kiss.jpg|thumb|right|A newly [[wedding|wed]] husband kissing his bride]]\nA '''husband''' is a [[male]] in a [[marriage|marital relationship]], same thing as a wife who may also be referred to as a [[spouse]] or partner. The rights and obligations of a husband regarding his spouse and others, and his status in the community and in law, vary between societies, cultures and have varied over time.\n\nIn [[monogamy|monogamous]] cultures, there are only two parties to a marriage, which is enforced by laws against [[bigamy]] and [[polygamy]]. Traditionally, the husband was regarded as the [[household|head of the household]] and was expected to be the sole provider or [[Breadwinner model|breadwinner]], a role that continues in some cultures (sometimes described as [[paternalistic]]). Today, a husband is not necessarily considered the [[Breadwinner model|breadwinner]] of the family,{{By whom|date=December 2017}} especially if his spouse has a more financially rewarding occupation or career. In such cases, it is not uncommon for a husband to be considered a stay-at-home father if the married couple have children.\n\nThe term continues to be applied to such a man who has [[Legal separation|separated]] from his spouse and ceases to be applied to him only when his marriage has come to an end following a legally recognized [[divorce]] or the death of his spouse. On the death of his spouse, a husband is referred to as a [[widower]]; after a divorce a man may be referred to as the \"ex-husband\" of his former spouse.\n\n==Origin and etymology==\nThe term ''husband'' refers to [[Middle English]] ''huseband'', from [[Old English]] ''h\u016bsb\u014dnda'', from [[Old Norse]] ''h\u016bsb\u014dndi'' (''h\u016bs'', \"house\" + ''b\u014dndi'', ''b\u016bandi'', present participle of ''b\u016ba'', \"to dwell\", so, etymologically, \"a householder\").\n\n==Related terms==\nAt the conclusion of a valid wedding, the marrying parties acquire the [[Social status|status]] of married persons and, while the marriage persists, a man is called a husband. In heterosexual marriages the woman is called a [[wife]]; in same-sex marriages between males, each male is called a husband. \n\nAlthough \"husband\" is a close term to [[bridegroom|groom]], the latter is a male participant in a wedding ceremony, while a husband is a married man after the wedding and for the duration of the marriage. The term husband refers to the institutionalized role of the married male, while the term father refers to the male in context of his offspring, a state which may or may not indicate that a marriage ceremony has taken place.\n\nIn some cases of heterosexual marriage, before the marriage, the forthcoming husband or his family may have received a [[dowry]], or have had to pay a [[bride price]], or both were exchanged. The dowry not only supported the establishment of a household, but also served as a condition that if the husband committed grave offenses upon his wife, he had to return the dowry to the wife or her family. For the time of the marriage, they were made inalienable by the husband.<ref>Britannica 2005, ''dowry''</ref>  He might leave his wife (or wives), then widow (or widows), a dower (often a third or a half of his estate) to support her as [[dowager]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://m-w.com/dictionary/dower|title=Dower - Definition of dower by Merriam-Webster|work=m-w.com}}</ref>\n\nAs an external symbol of the fact that they are married, each spouse commonly wears a [[wedding ring]] on the ring finger; whether this is on the left or right hand depends on the country's tradition.\n\n\"Husband\" further refers to the institutionalized form in relation to the spouse and offspring, unlike father, a term that puts a man into the context of his children. Also compare the similar [[husbandry]],<ref>See Wiktionary {{linktext|husbandry}}</ref> which in the 14th century referred to the care of the household, but today means the \"control or judicious use of resources\", conservation, and in agriculture, the cultivation of plants and animals, and the science about its [[profession]].<ref>Merriam\u2013Webster's Collegiate Dictionary</ref>\n\n==Western culture==\n\n===Historical status===\n[[File:Seuso and his wife at Lake Balaton.jpg|thumb|Seuso and his wife]] \nIn premodern heterosexual unions ([[ancient Roman]], [[medieval]], and early modern history), a husband was obliged to protect and support not only his wife and children, but servants and animals of his domain. The  father (as the \"[[patron]]\") was awarded with much [[authority]], differing from that of his wife (in these cultures, no polygamy existed).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ancienthistory.about.com/library/bl/bl_text_mommsen_1_5_2.htm|title=The History of Rome, by Theodor Mommsen  Book I Chapter 5 Section 2|work=About.com Ancient/Classical History}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Middle Ages]] and [[Early Modern]] European history, it was unusual to marry out of love, but then doing so became an influential ideal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sgn.org/sgnnews34_45/page6.cfm|title=SGN Page 6|author=|date=|website=www.sgn.org}}</ref><ref>William C. Horne, Making a heaven of hell: the problem of the companionate ideal in English marriage, poetry, 1650\u20131800 Athens (Georgia), 1993</ref> During this period, a husband in a heterosexual marriage had more opportunities in society than his wife, who was not recognized as legally independent.<ref>William Blackstone, Commentaries upon the Laws of England</ref>\n\n===Contemporary status===\nIn contemporary [[secularized]] Western culture, the rights of the spouses have been made equal. The [[civil marriage]] generally forces the wealthier spouse \"''breadwinner''\" to provide [[alimony]] to the former spouse, even after separation and also after a divorce (see also [[Law and divorce around the world]]).\n\nThe legal status of marriage allows each spouse to speak on the other's behalf when one is incapacitated (e.g., in a coma); a husband is also responsible for his spouse's child(ren) in states where he is automatically assumed to be the [[biological father]].<ref>Cuckoo's egg in the nest, Spiegel 07, 2007</ref>\n\n==Religion==\n\n===Islam===\nIn [[Islamic marital jurisprudence]], husbands are considered protectors of the household and their wives. As protector, the husband has [[Rights and obligations of spouses in Islam|various rights and obligations]] that he is expected to fulfill and thus is offered opportunities different from that of his wife or wives, not only in legal and economical affairs of the family but within the family as well. As in most cases in Islam law and culture, everything is being related to the [[Qur'an]].\n\nMany Muslims may agree on a perfectly equal relationship.<ref>[[Heba Kotb|Heba G. Kotb MD]], [http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/GESUND/ARCHIV/kotb2.htm Sexuality in Islam] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110709125251/http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/GESUND/ARCHIV/kotb2.htm |date=9 July 2011 }}, PhD Thesis, Maimonides University, 2004</ref> Islam is the only major religion that puts a cap on [[Polygyny in Islam|polygamy]], limiting the number of a man's wives to four\u2014provided the husband can do justice to all of them. Although some religions, such as Catholicism for instance, puts a cap on polygamy all together, or even serial monogamy, allowing one spouse until death does them apart, not even accepting divorce. According to the teachings of Islam a Muslim man should have a valid reason and have to get permission from his existing wife (without any force) if he requires to marry again. Islam vehemently abhors any intimate relationship outside the bond of marriage.\n\nThere is no external sign to show his status as a husband, unless he adopted the tradition of wearing a wedding ring.\n\n===Hinduism===\n{{See also|Marriage in Hinduism}}\nA Hindu husband traditionally takes his wife to his home. He is expected to provide for her and to prove his abilities to do so.

The rights and obligations of a husband regarding his spouse and others, and his status in the community and in law, vary between societies, cultures and have varied over time.\n\nIn [[monogamy|monogamous]] cultures, there are only two parties to a marriage, which is enforced by laws against [[bigamy]] and [[polygamy]]. Traditionally, the husband was regarded as the [[household|head of the household]] and was expected to be the sole provider or [[Breadwinner model|breadwinner]], a role that continues in some cultures (sometimes described as [[paternalistic]]). Today, a husband is not necessarily considered the [[Breadwinner model|breadwinner]] of the family,{{By whom|date=December 2017}} especially if his spouse has a more financially rewarding occupation or career. In such cases, it is not uncommon for a husband to be considered a stay-at-home father if the married couple have children.\n\nThe term continues to be applied to such a man who has [[Legal separation|separated]] from his spouse and ceases to be applied to him only when his marriage has come to an end following a legally recognized [[divorce]] or the death of his spouse. On the death of his spouse, a husband is referred to as a [[widower]]; after a divorce a man may be referred to as the \"ex-husband\" of his former spouse.\n\n==Origin and etymology==\nThe term ''husband'' refers to [[Middle English]] ''huseband'', from [[Old English]] ''h\u016bsb\u014dnda'', from [[Old Norse]] ''h\u016bsb\u014dndi'' (''h\u016bs'', \"house\" + ''b\u014dndi'', ''b\u016bandi'', present participle of ''b\u016ba'', \"to dwell\", so, etymologically, \"a householder\").\n\n==Related terms==\nAt the conclusion of a valid wedding, the marrying parties acquire the [[Social status|status]] of married persons and, while the marriage persists, a man is called a husband. In heterosexual marriages the woman is called a [[wife]]; in same-sex marriages between males, each male is called a husband. \n\nAlthough \"husband\" is a close term to [[bridegroom|groom]], the latter is a male participant in a wedding ceremony, while a husband is a married man after the wedding and for the duration of the marriage. The term husband refers to the institutionalized role of the married male, while the term father refers to the male in context of his offspring, a state which may or may not indicate that a marriage ceremony has taken place.\n\nIn some cases of heterosexual marriage, before the marriage, the forthcoming husband or his family may have received a [[dowry]], or have had to pay a [[bride price]], or both were exchanged. The dowry not only supported the establishment of a household, but also served as a condition that if the husband committed grave offenses upon his wife, he had to return the dowry to the wife or her family. For the time of the marriage, they were made inalienable by the husband.<ref>Britannica 2005, ''dowry''</ref>  He might leave his wife (or wives), then widow (or widows), a dower (often a third or a half of his estate) to support her as [[dowager]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://m-w.com/dictionary/dower|title=Dower - Definition of dower by Merriam-Webster|work=m-w.com}}</ref>\n\nAs an external symbol of the fact that they are married, each spouse commonly wears a [[wedding ring]] on the ring finger; whether this is on the left or right hand depends on the country's tradition.\n\n\"Husband\" further refers to the institutionalized form in relation to the spouse and offspring, unlike father, a term that puts a man into the context of his children. Also compare the similar [[husbandry]],<ref>See Wiktionary {{linktext|husbandry}}</ref> which in the 14th century referred to the care of the household, but today means the \"control or judicious use of resources\", conservation, and in agriculture, the cultivation of plants and animals, and the science about its [[profession]].<ref>Merriam\u2013Webster's Collegiate Dictionary</ref>\n\n==Western culture==\n\n===Historical status===\n[[File:Seuso and his wife at Lake Balaton.jpg|thumb|Seuso and his wife]] \nIn premodern heterosexual unions ([[ancient Roman]], [[medieval]], and early modern history), a husband was obliged to protect and support not only his wife and children, but servants and animals of his domain. The  father (as the \"[[patron]]\") was awarded with much [[authority]], differing from that of his wife (in these cultures, no polygamy existed).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ancienthistory.about.com/library/bl/bl_text_mommsen_1_5_2.htm|title=The History of Rome, by Theodor Mommsen  Book I Chapter 5 Section 2|work=About.com Ancient/Classical History}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Middle Ages]] and [[Early Modern]] European history, it was unusual to marry out of love, but then doing so became an influential ideal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sgn.org/sgnnews34_45/page6.cfm|title=SGN Page 6|author=|date=|website=www.sgn.org}}</ref><ref>William C.

The [[civil marriage]] generally forces the wealthier spouse \"''breadwinner''\" to provide [[alimony]] to the former spouse, even after separation and also after a divorce (see also [[Law and divorce around the world]]).\n\nThe legal status of marriage allows each spouse to speak on the other's behalf when one is incapacitated (e.g., in a coma); a husband is also responsible for his spouse's child(ren) in states where he is automatically assumed to be the [[biological father]].<ref>Cuckoo's egg in the nest, Spiegel 07, 2007</ref>\n\n==Religion==\n\n===Islam===\nIn [[Islamic marital jurisprudence]], husbands are considered protectors of the household and their wives. As protector, the husband has [[Rights and obligations of spouses in Islam|various rights and obligations]] that he is expected to fulfill and thus is offered opportunities different from that of his wife or wives, not only in legal and economical affairs of the family but within the family as well. As in most cases in Islam law and culture, everything is being related to the [[Qur'an]].\n\nMany Muslims may agree on a perfectly equal relationship.<ref>[[Heba Kotb|Heba G.

Although some religions, such as Catholicism for instance, puts a cap on polygamy all together, or even serial monogamy, allowing one spouse until death does them apart, not even accepting divorce. According to the teachings of Islam a Muslim man should have a valid reason and have to get permission from his existing wife (without any force) if he requires to marry again. Islam vehemently abhors any intimate relationship outside the bond of marriage.\n\nThere is no external sign to show his status as a husband, unless he adopted the tradition of wearing a wedding ring.\n\n===Hinduism===\n{{See also|Marriage in Hinduism}}\nA Hindu husband traditionally takes his wife to his home.
