artist]] who competed in the [[Middleweight (MMA)|Middleweight]] division. A professional competitor from 1997 until 2015, he competed for the [[UFC]], [[Bellator MMA|Bellator]], and [[Strikeforce (mixed martial arts)|Strikeforce]].\n\n==Mixed martial arts career==\n===Background===\nJensen began training at the age of 15, under [[UFC 3]] winner [[Steve Jennum]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://themmacorner.com/2014/03/12/vfcs-ryan-jensen-im-no-stepping-stone/|title=VFC\u2019s Ryan Jensen: \u2018I\u2019m No Stepping Stone\u2019|accessdate=2015-02-15}}</ref> Following his first fight against [[Travis Fulton]] in February 1997, he did not compete again until June 2002. Jensen quit his day job in November 2006, and has been training and fighting full-time since then.\n\n===Ultimate Fighting Championship===\nHis [[United Farmers of Canada|UFC]] debut was on August 25, 2007 at [[UFC 74]]; his initial opponent was supposed be [[Travis Lutter]], however Lutter was forced to withdraw due to injury. Instead, Jensen faced late replacement [[Thales Leites]] and after a strong start, got caught by an [[armbar]] submission in the first round. He followed this up with another loss to [[Demian Maia]] before leaving the [[United Farmers of Canada|UFC]].\n\nOn March 29, 2008, Jensen accepted a fight against [[Joey Villasenor]] on four days notice in the [[Strikeforce (mixed martial arts)|Strikeforce]] promotion. Again, after a strong start, Jensen lost by [[KO]] with 15 seconds remaining in the first round at [[Strikeforce: Shamrock vs. Le]].\n\nSince then, Jensen rebounded with a first round TKO over Mitch Whitesel at SportFight 23 in June 2008, as well as a first round submission victory over Aaron Praschack due to strikes in VFC 23.\n\nJensen then returned to the UFC and was defeated by [[Wilson Gouveia]] at [[UFC Fight Night: Diaz vs Neer]] via submission (armbar).\n\nThis was followed up by a win over [[Steve Steinbeiss]] at [[UFC Fight Night: Diaz vs. Guillard]] via first round technical submission.\n\nJensen faced [[Mark Mu\u00f1oz]] at [[UFC 108]] on January 2, 2010.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://mmajunkie.com/news/16550/mark-munoz-vs-ryan-jensen-inked-for-ufc-108-in-las-vegas.mma|title=Mark Munoz vs. Ryan Jensen inked for UFC 108 in Las Vegas|publisher=mmajunkie.com|accessdate=2009-10-20|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091023030611/http://mmajunkie.com/news/16550/mark-munoz-vs-ryan-jensen-inked-for-ufc-108-in-las-vegas.mma|archivedate=2009-10-23}}</ref> He lost the fight via submission (punches) at the 2:30 mark of the first round.\n\nJensen faced [[Jesse Forbes]]  at [[UFC 114]] on May 29, 2010.
