As a postdoctoral researcher based in Finland he undertook extensive research on Russian formalism and semiotics in Russia and the Baltic countries. In 2000 he received  his [[habilitation]] from the [[School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences|EHESS]] of Paris. He has also been researching for several years in Japan, in particular on the [[Kyoto School]], and worked for the Center of Cognition of [[Zhejiang University]] (Hangzhou, China) as a consultant and researcher. From 2007 to 2009 he was Assistant Professor of philosophy at [[Tuskegee University]], which is a historically black university ([[HBCU]]) in Alabama. He is now Associate Professor of philosophy at [[Gulf University for Science and Technology]] in Kuwait.\n\n== Philosophy ==\nMost broadly speaking, Botz-Bornstein attempts in his philosophy to establish conceptual links between style, play, and dream. He does so by borrowing elements from non-Western philosophies (Russian, Japanese, Chinese), architecture, and the aesthetics of cinema. His philosophy is thus determined by an organic \u201cplay-style-dream\u201d triangle, which he uses as a theoretical foundation in his works on aesthetics (organic space, organic style, organic architecture,\u00a0organic film, etc.), intercultural communication, virtual reality, and politics. His approach can be described as \u201cneo-organic.\" World War II experiences of totalitarianism led to the perception that any totality\u00a0must \u00a0be split apart or deconstructed. Botz-Bornstein's neo-organicism presents a hermeneutic alternative\u00a0by rethinking\u00a0synthesis and dynamic forms of holism without falling into the trap of totalitarianism. The result is a distinct philosophy of space determined by aesthetic elaborations of dreams, hermeneutics, and stylistics. In his writings on hermeneutics, Botz-Bornstein analyzes \"the place of the dream\" or \"the place as a played phenomenon\" able to evolve organically.\n\nLinked to his central research on the phenomenon of style and play is his research on Japanese philosophy, especially those parts that are inspired by Zen Buddhism. One of Botz-Bornstein's early starting points (1992) was [[Kuki Sh\u016bz\u014d]]\u2019s notion of 'iki' which Botz-Bornstein interpreted as an idea related to Western elaborations of the term style. Since then, he has presented comparisons of [[Nishida Kitaro]] with various Western authors, for example [[Mikhail Bakhtin]], [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] and, most recently, [[Muhammad Abduh]]. Other topics are [[Pan-Asianism]], [[Eurasianism]], [[Pan-Slavism]], and corresponding reflections on the 'cultural sphere' and the international world order. Botz-Bornstein is also working on religion, on the idea of the 'virtual' in aesthetics, and on cultural theory as well as about meta-philosophical questions linked to [[ethnophilosophy]]. His philosophical style is determined by the continental tradition and develops in proximity with Cultural Studies.\n\n== Publications ==\n'''Authored Books:'''\n\n''The New Aesthetics of Deculturation: Neoliberalism, Fundamentalism and Kitsch'' (Bloomsbury, 2019).\n\n''The Political Aesthetics of ISIS and Italian Futurism'' (Lexington, 2018)\n\n''Organic Cinema: Film Architecture, and the Work of Bela Tarr'' (Berghahn, 2017)\n\n''Transcultural Architecture: Limits and Opportunities of Critical Regionalism'' (Ashgate, 2015)\n\n''Veils, Nudity, and Tattoos: The New Feminine Aesthetics'' (Lexington, 2015)\n\n''Virtual Reality: The Last Human Narrative?''

In 1898, the British introduced coffee to the [[East Godavari]] district in [[Pamuluru]] before it spread to Araku in the early 19th century. After independence, the [[Andhra Pradesh Forest Department]] took up coffee plantations in the valley and by 1956, the [[Coffee Board of India]] appointed Girijan Cooperative Corporation (GCC) for its promotion through local tribal farmers. In a significant development, the Naidu Government and [[SpiceJet]], the third largest airline in the country by number of domestic passengers carried, came forward to serve the organic brew of Araku to its passengers. SpiceJet air hostesses would make special announcements about the brand and its significance, and about the coffee plantations in Araku Valley. To increase visits to tourist places located around Araku Valley, a scheme of scratch cards was introduced. Cards would be given to every passenger and two lucky passengers, along with their families, would receive free accommodation in Araku Valley and the tourism department would pay to the airline towards promotion of Araku Coffee. The brand became so popular and exotic that Naidu gifted them to Korean and Russian delegates during their visits and the coffee was marketed in all the international investor meetings organised by the state.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/Naidu-markets-Araku-coffee-at-womens-meet/articleshow/51893052.cms|title=Naidu markets Araku coffee at women's meet|date=19 April 2016 |work=The Times of India|language=en|access-date=16 March 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.yovizag.com/araku-coffee-exotic-brand/|title=Coffee From Araku - Our Very Own Exotic Brand |date=27 May 2017|website=Yo Vizag|language=en-US|access-date=16 March 2020}}</ref> Naidu once said that Araku Valley\u2019s tribal coffee is competing with Columbian and Sumatran coffee in the international market.

In 1898, the British introduced coffee to the [[East Godavari]] district in [[Pamuluru]] before it spread to Araku in the early 19th century. After independence, the [[Andhra Pradesh Forest Department]] took up coffee plantations in the valley and by 1956, the [[Coffee Board of India]] appointed Girijan Cooperative Corporation (GCC) for its promotion through local tribal farmers. In a significant development, the Naidu Government and [[SpiceJet]], the third largest airline in the country by number of domestic passengers carried, came forward to serve the organic brew of Araku to its passengers. SpiceJet air hostesses would make special announcements about the brand and its significance, and about the coffee plantations in Araku Valley. To increase visits to tourist places located around Araku Valley, a scheme of scratch cards was introduced. Cards would be given to every passenger and two lucky passengers, along with their families, would receive free accommodation in Araku Valley and the tourism department would pay to the airline towards promotion of Araku Coffee.

It involved [[Richard Nixon]], the 37th president of the United States and led him to resignation. This scandal stemmed from the attempts of 5 former [[FBI]] and [[CIA]] agents broke in the Democratic National Committee headquarters which is located at the [[Watergate Office Building]], Washington D.C.

The media, especially, The Washington Post, significantly contributed to highlight the fact that there\u2019s the rotten connection between the breaking in the Watergate Office and Richard Nixon\u2019s re-election committee.<ref name=\":2\" /> In addition, its coverage led to an explosion of publicity and public attention. To cover the scandal, anonymous sources became the main material that The Washington Post heavily relied on. Specifically, the Washington Post\u2019s investigative journalists named [[Bob Woodward]] and [[Carl Bernstein]] played a really important role. <ref name=\":2\" /> They uncovered information and evidence that proved the agents' break-in to plant a bug and attempts to conceal it which result in the intervention of the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]], [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]], and the [[White House]].<ref name=\":2\" /> In addition, they conducted interviews with a witness named [[Judy Hoback Miller]]. He was the book keep who worked at the Richard Nixon\u2019s re-election committee and had an evidence showing how Richard Nixon and his committee mishandled the funds and destroyed the records, the evidence of conspiracy.<ref name=\":2\" /> The most valuable and reliable anonymous sources came from person who didn\u2019t reveal his identity at the time. He was called Deep Throat by Woodward and Bernstein.<ref name=\":2\" /> Every meeting between investigative journalists of The Washington Post and Deep Throat was held secretly.<ref name=\":2\" /> And through these meetings, involvement of the Richard Nixon, his committee and the White House was revealed. Later, it was also revealed that Deep Throat, the anonymous informant, is the deputy director of the FBI during 1970s named William Mark Felt, Sr.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== Criticism ==\n\nEven though watchdog journalism plays an really important role for democracy in a society, it cannot avoid of being criticized and disappearing.<ref name=\":10\" /> Since several years ago, watchdog journalism tends to decrease. As a result, watchdog reporting is rarely to be handled by media no matter the types of the channel.<ref name=\":10\" /> This tendency is because what journalists pursue is different from the past. specifically, most journalists these day prefer simply reflecting the status quo to scrutinizing and challenging it.<ref name=\":10\" /> However, the problem is that there are still issues, corruptions, and scandals that have to be covered by journalist. For example, even the situation in the United States, the country where watchdog journalists forced the president out of the White House also shows this tendency.<ref name=\":10\" /> In 2003, the U.S media reported widely on Iraq War and in the process, it was revealed that most media don't function as the critical and skeptical watchdog journalism. <ref name=\":10\" /> In addition, there is also a voice saying that watchdog journalism does not work for a democracy and a healthy society anymore, rather it works to serve journalists' own interests.<ref name=\":10\" /><br />\n\n=== Crisis in watchdog journalism  ===\n[[File:University of Illinois at Chicago circle logo.svg|thumb|131x131px|University of Illinois at Chiage circle logo]]Journalism\u2019s role as a watchdog is in danger of disappearing in a lot of societies and countries across the world. Basically, watchdog journalism has to force people in power, for instance government officials, to take a responsibility of their actions that affect public's way of living.<ref name=\":3\" /> However, since local news media and newspaper have faced closing or consolidation, it is hard to see journalism that watches those in power.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://apnews.com/816b31f8571d4b759227e58c6252e99d|title=Loss of local news hinders ability to watchdog government|date=2019-03-11|website=AP NEWS|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref> To be specific, in the case of the United States, the phenomenon of disappearing a local newspaper has happened in more than 1,400 cities since 15 years ago according to an [[Associated Press]]'s research which was conducted through data gathered by the [[University of North Carolina]].<ref name=\":3\" /> And those cities are where watchdog journalism that reports issues and problems caused by actions of a corrupt people in power is necessarily needed. As a result, several negative outcomes for the community has been brought. Foremost, rotten actions of people in power such as politicians are unable to be criticized and watched. This is because there is no transparency that can solve problems and achieve a healthy democracy. <ref name=\":3\" />[[File:University of Notre Dame seal (2).svg|thumb|132x132px|University of Notre Dame seal]]\n\n\n\nIn addition, disappearing of a local newspaper that plays a role as a watchdog journalism is related to putting a financial problem directly on members in a community.<ref name=\":3\" /> Based on the research conducted by the [[University of Illinois at Chicago]] and the [[University of Notre Dame]], it is found that increasing in borrowing costs after a local newspaper is closed has a close connection with municipal government. <ref name=\":3\" /> It indicates that the absence of a watchdog journalism leaves public out of a discussion and helps people in power such as government officials to refuse to increase working people\u2019s wages and in payrolls.<ref name=\":3\" /> People in power is highly likely to engage in wasteful spending because there is no journalism that watches and criticizes their actions, decisions, and policies. To simply put, if there is no investigative journalism, important issues that public must know are not covered.

The detached watchdog journalism is predominant especially in the western countries such as Germany, the United States, Austria, and Switzerland.<ref name=\":10\" />\n\nIn the detached approach, the most predominant form of watchdog journalism, criticism and question which are done by sources are the least intense levels of scrutiny.

It involved [[Richard Nixon]], the 37th president of the United States and led him to resignation. This scandal stemmed from the attempts of 5 former [[FBI]] and [[CIA]] agents broke in the Democratic National Committee headquarters which is located at the [[Watergate Office Building]], Washington D.C. What they were trying to do was to plant a bug for Richard Nixon\u2019s winning the re-election in exchange for receiving the cash.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Schudson|first=Michael|date=May 2004|title=Notes on Scandal and the Watergate Legacy|journal=American Behavioral Scientist|language=en|volume=47|issue=9|pages=1231\u20131238|doi=10.1177/0002764203262345|issn=0002-7642}}</ref> After 5 perpetrators were arrested, several revelation and investigation were progressed until 1973 and it made the House decide to commence an impeachment process against Nixon. The Oval Office tapes, the significant evidence of the Watergate scandal, revealed that Nixon tried to cover up what he did to win the re-election such as breaking-in and using federal officials. As a result, the impeachment against Richard Nixon was approved by the House judiciary committee.<ref name=\":2\" /> He resigned from all of offices on August 9, 1974.\n\n[[File:Carl bernstein 2007.jpg|thumb|233x233px|Carl Bernstein, the investigative journalist of The Washington Post]]\n\n=== The role of Washington Post as watchdog journalism in the case of Watergate scandal ===\nThe case of Watergate scandal is the most famous example showing the role of watchdog journalism, how it works and even further, its impact. The media, especially, The Washington Post, significantly contributed to highlight the fact that there\u2019s the rotten connection between the breaking in the Watergate Office and Richard Nixon\u2019s re-election committee.<ref name=\":2\" /> In addition, its coverage led to an explosion of publicity and public attention. To cover the scandal, anonymous sources became the main material that The Washington Post heavily relied on. Specifically, the Washington Post\u2019s investigative journalists named [[Bob Woodward]] and [[Carl Bernstein]] played a really important role. <ref name=\":2\" /> They uncovered information and evidence that proved the agents' break-in to plant a bug and attempts to conceal it which result in the intervention of the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]], [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]], and the [[White House]].<ref name=\":2\" /> In addition, they conducted interviews with a witness named [[Judy Hoback Miller]]. He was the book keep who worked at the Richard Nixon\u2019s re-election committee and had an evidence showing how Richard Nixon and his committee mishandled the funds and destroyed the records, the evidence of conspiracy.<ref name=\":2\" /> The most valuable and reliable anonymous sources came from person who didn\u2019t reveal his identity at the time. He was called Deep Throat by Woodward and Bernstein.<ref name=\":2\" /> Every meeting between investigative journalists of The Washington Post and Deep Throat was held secretly.<ref name=\":2\" /> And through these meetings, involvement of the Richard Nixon, his committee and the White House was revealed. Later, it was also revealed that Deep Throat, the anonymous informant, is the deputy director of the FBI during 1970s named William Mark Felt, Sr.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== Criticism ==\n\nEven though watchdog journalism plays an really important role for democracy in a society, it cannot avoid of being criticized and disappearing.<ref name=\":10\" /> Since several years ago, watchdog journalism tends to decrease. As a result, watchdog reporting is rarely to be handled by media no matter the types of the channel.<ref name=\":10\" /> This tendency is because what journalists pursue is different from the past. specifically, most journalists these day prefer simply reflecting the status quo to scrutinizing and challenging it.<ref name=\":10\" /> However, the problem is that there are still issues, corruptions, and scandals that have to be covered by journalist. For example, even the situation in the United States, the country where watchdog journalists forced the president out of the White House also shows this tendency.<ref name=\":10\" /> In 2003, the U.S media reported widely on Iraq War and in the process, it was revealed that most media don't function as the critical and skeptical watchdog journalism. <ref name=\":10\" /> In addition, there is also a voice saying that watchdog journalism does not work for a democracy and a healthy society anymore, rather it works to serve journalists' own interests.<ref name=\":10\" /><br />\n\n=== Crisis in watchdog journalism these days ===\n[[File:University of Illinois at Chicago circle logo.svg|thumb|131x131px|University of Illinois at Chiage circle logo]]Journalism\u2019s role as a watchdog is in danger of disappearing in a lot of societies and countries across the world. Basically, watchdog journalism has to force people in power, for instance government officials, to take a responsibility of their actions that affect public's way of living.<ref name=\":3\" /> However, since local news media and newspaper have faced closing or consolidation, it is hard to see journalism that watches those in power.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://apnews.com/816b31f8571d4b759227e58c6252e99d|title=Loss of local news hinders ability to watchdog government|date=2019-03-11|website=AP NEWS|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref> To be specific, in the case of the United States, the phenomenon of disappearing a local newspaper has happened in more than 1,400 cities since 15 years ago according to an [[Associated Press]]'s research which was conducted through data gathered by the [[University of North Carolina]].<ref name=\":3\" /> And those cities are where watchdog journalism that reports issues and problems caused by actions of a corrupt people in power is necessarily needed. As a result, several negative outcomes for the community has been brought. Foremost, rotten actions of people in power such as politicians are unable to be criticized and watched. This is because there is no transparency that can solve problems and achieve a healthy democracy. <ref name=\":3\" />[[File:University of Notre Dame seal (2).svg|thumb|132x132px|University of Notre Dame seal]]\n\n\n\nIn addition, disappearing of a local newspaper that plays a role as a watchdog journalism is related to putting a financial problem directly on members in a community.<ref name=\":3\" /> Based on the research conducted by the [[University of Illinois at Chicago]] and the [[University of Notre Dame]], it is found that increasing in borrowing costs after a local newspaper is closed has a close connection with municipal government. <ref name=\":3\" /> It indicates that the absence of a watchdog journalism leaves public out of a discussion and helps people in power such as government officials to refuse to increase working people\u2019s wages and in payrolls.<ref name=\":3\" /> People in power is highly likely to engage in wasteful spending because there is no journalism that watches and criticizes their actions, decisions, and policies. To simply put, if there is no investigative journalism, important issues that public must know are not covered. So instead of reporting on fraud, abuse, and waste, useless and meaningless topics will be handled as if they are the only a problem that a community faces.<ref name=\":3\" /> For instance, a corruption which is related to various public infrastructures such as hospital that require more resource with a high quality to provide better service to public will be less likely to be told.<ref name=\":3\" /> \n\n<br />\n== See also ==\n* [[Muckraking]]\n* [[Whistleblowing]]\n* [[Guardian Project (software)]]\n* [[Investigative journalism]]\n* [[Fake News]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* ''[http://www.niemanwatchdog.org/ Nieman Watchdog: Questions the Press Should Ask]'' \u2013 Official site ([[Nieman Foundation for Journalism]] at [[Harvard University]]).\n* ''[https://www.newsmediawatchdog.com/ News Media Watchdog]''\n\n{{Journalism footer}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Watchdog Journalism}}\n[[Category:Watchdog journalism| ]]\n", "name_user": "Dahlsydney", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eCrisis in watchdog journalism these days:unnecessary use of \"these days\" ; removed it", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchdog_journalism"}

The tournament was inspired by [[Premier League Darts]], which is organized by the professional darts organisation, [[Professional Darts Corporation|PDC]]. The idea to play this tournament was created during the world-wide pandemic of [[COVID-19|Covid-19]]. The meaning of the competition is, apart from the fight against the coronavirus, also an introduction of more Czech players to the general public. For players it is a great opportunity to practice and compete during this hard time and to gain much needed experience for future years of their careers.<ref>https://isport.blesk.cz/clanek/ostatni-dalsi-sporty-sipky/377640/sipky-i-v-dobe-koronaviru-startuje-ceska-obdoba-premier-league.html</ref>\n\n== Format ==\nThe format of the tournament is very similar to Premier League Darts, which is organised by the [[Professional Darts Corporation|PDC]]. The main difference is the absence of a draw, each match has a winner and a loser. Each match starts with a [[bullseye (target)|bulls-eye]] shootout, which decides who will start the match. The first player to throw on the bulls-eye is the one that is listed as the first in the schedule. Values of the shootout are: 50 - the red middle; 25 - the green middle; outside. If both players score the same value, the shootout continues in the reversed order until the decision.\n\n'''Phase 1:'''  In the first phase of the competition (9 rounds), ten players play each other. Phase 1 matches have a maximum of eleven legs, allowing for the winner being first to six. At the end of Phase 1, the two bottom players are eliminated from the competition.\n\n'''Phase 2:''' In the second phase of the competition (7 rounds), eight remaining players play again each other. Phase 2 matches have a maximum of thirteen legs, allowing for the winner being first to seven. At the end of Phase 2, the bottom four players in the league table are eliminated from the competition. The first four players in the league table qualify for the Play-off.\n\n'''Play-off:''' The top four players in the league table contest the two knockout semi-finals with 1st playing 4th and 2nd playing 3rd. The semi-finals are first to 10 legs (best of 19). The two winning semi-finalists meet in the final which is also best of 19.\n\n== Venues ==\nDue to the [[coronavirus outbreak]] and regulations from the government of the [[Czech Republic]], all players will play from their home. All players have a [[webcam]] prepared in their home environment, through which it is possible to watch every thrown dart. After each throw, players announce their score. Viewers see both [[dartboard]]s at the same time, along with the scoreboard which is powered by [[DartConnect]].\n\n{{Location map+ | Czechia\n| width=700\n| caption=Map of player's locations\n| float=left\n| places =\n  {{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = Fulnek\n    | lat_deg = 49.71\n    | lon_deg = 17.90 }}\n  {{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = Zderaz\n    | position=bottom\n    | lat_deg = 49.82\n    | lon_deg = 16.10 }}\n{{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = \u00davaly\n    | lat_deg = 50.07\n    | lon_deg = 14.73 }}\n  {{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = Prague\n    | position=left\n    | lat_deg = 50.08\n    | lon_deg = 14.41 }}\n{{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = Hradec Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9\n    | lat_deg = 50.21\n    | lon_deg = 15.83 }}\n  {{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = \u00dasobrno\n    | lat_deg = 49.59\n    | lon_deg = 16.78 }}\n{{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = Bouzov\n    | position=left\n    | lat_deg = 49.70\n    | lon_deg = 16.89 }}\n  {{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = Po\u0159\u00ed\u010d\u00ed u Litomy\u0161le\n    | position=top\n    | lat_deg = 49.80\n    | lon_deg = 16.19 }}\n{{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = Uni\u010dov\n    | position=top\n    | lat_deg = 49.77\n    | lon_deg = 17.12 }}\n  {{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = N\u00e1vs\u00ed\n    | lat_deg = 49.58\n    | lon_deg = 18.76 }}\n}}\n\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br><br><br><br>\n<br><br><br><br>\n<br><br><br><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n\n== Prize money ==\nThe first edition of the tournament does not include any prize money for players. On the contrary, the tournament has a charity meaning.

The tournament was inspired by [[Premier League Darts]], which is organized by the professional darts organisation, [[Professional Darts Corporation|PDC]]. The idea to play this tournament was created during the world-wide pandemic of [[COVID-19|Covid-19]]. The meaning of the competition is, apart from the fight against the coronavirus, also an introduction of more Czech players to the general public. For players it is a great opportunity to practice and compete during this hard time and to gain much needed experience for future years of their careers.<ref>https://isport.blesk.cz/clanek/ostatni-dalsi-sporty-sipky/377640/sipky-i-v-dobe-koronaviru-startuje-ceska-obdoba-premier-league.html</ref>\n\n== Format ==\nThe format of the tournament is very similar to Premier League Darts, which is organised by the [[Professional Darts Corporation|PDC]]. The main difference is the absence of a draw, each match has a winner and a loser. Each match starts with a [[bullseye (target)|bulls-eye]] shootout, which decides who will start the match. The first player to throw on the bulls-eye is the one that is listed as the first in the schedule. Values of the shootout are: 50 - the red middle; 25 - the green middle; outside. If both players score the same value, the shootout continues in the reversed order until the decision.\n\n'''Phase 1:'''  In the first phase of the competition (9 rounds), ten players play each other. Phase 1 matches have a maximum of eleven legs, allowing for the winner being first to six. At the end of Phase 1, the two bottom players are eliminated from the competition.\n\n'''Phase 2:''' In the second phase of the competition (7 rounds), eight remaining players play again each other. Phase 2 matches have a maximum of thirteen legs, allowing for the winner being first to seven. At the end of Phase 2, the bottom four players in the league table are eliminated from the competition. The first four players in the league table qualify for the Play-off.\n\n'''Play-off:''' The top four players in the league table contest the two knockout semi-finals with 1st playing 4th and 2nd playing 3rd. The semi-finals are first to 10 legs (best of 19). The two winning semi-finalists meet in the final which is also best of 19.\n\n== Venues ==\nDue to the [[coronavirus outbreak]] and regulations from the government of the [[Czech Republic]], all players will play from their home. All players have a [[webcam]] prepared in their home environment, through which it is possible to watch every thrown dart. After each throw, players announce their score. Viewers see both [[dartboard]]s at the same time, along with the scoreboard which is powered by [[DartConnect]].\n\n{{Location map+ | Czechia\n| width=700\n| caption=Map of player's locations\n| float=left\n| places =\n  {{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = Fulnek\n    | lat_deg = 49.71\n    | lon_deg = 17.90 }}\n  {{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = Zderaz\n    | position=bottom\n    | lat_deg = 49.82\n    | lon_deg = 16.10 }}\n{{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = \u00davaly\n    | lat_deg = 50.07\n    | lon_deg = 14.73 }}\n  {{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = Prague\n    | position=left\n    | lat_deg = 50.08\n    | lon_deg = 14.41 }}\n{{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = Hradec Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9\n    | lat_deg = 50.21\n    | lon_deg = 15.83 }}\n  {{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = \u00dasobrno\n    | lat_deg = 49.59\n    | lon_deg = 16.78 }}\n{{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = Bouzov\n    | position=left\n    | lat_deg = 49.70\n    | lon_deg = 16.89 }}\n  {{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = Po\u0159\u00ed\u010d\u00ed u Litomy\u0161le\n    | position=top\n    | lat_deg = 49.80\n    | lon_deg = 16.19 }}\n{{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = Uni\u010dov\n    | position=top\n    | lat_deg = 49.77\n    | lon_deg = 17.12 }}\n  {{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = N\u00e1vs\u00ed\n    | lat_deg = 49.58\n    | lon_deg = 18.76 }}\n}}\n\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br><br><br><br>\n<br><br><br><br>\n<br><br><br><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n\n== Prize money ==\nThe first edition of the tournament does not include any prize money for players. On the contrary, the tournament has a charity meaning. For every thrown \"180\", the official partner of 2020 Tipsport Premier League, the company [[Tipsport]], donates 500 [[CZK]] for purchase of medical equipment (face masks, ventilators etc.) for the fight against the [[coronavirus]].<ref>https://www.irozhlas.cz/sport/ostatni-sporty/sipky-virtualni-serie-ceska-premier-league-pres-internet_2004030830_wei</ref>\n\n== Players==\nFor the first edition of Tipsport Premier League, 10 players have been chosen in advance including the former [[PDC World Youth Championship]] runner-up and [[JDC]]{{disambiguation needed|date=April 2020}} World Darts Championship runner-up, [[Adam Gawlas]] and the former [[PDC World Cup of Darts]] national team member, [[Pavel Jirkal]]. Other players have experience from international tournaments and are the best players in Czech Republic. The current Czech number one, [[Karel Sedl\u00e1\u010dek]], though invited, could not compete due to the contract obligations to [[Professional Darts Corporation|PDC]].<ref>https://sport.tn.nova.cz/clanek/ceske-sipky-spousti-svou-premier-league-zacina-se-uz-pristi-tyden.html</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Player\n|-\n|[[File:Daniel Barbo\u0159\u00e1k.jpg|100px|alt=Daniel Barbo\u0159\u00e1k|frameless]]{{flagicon|CZE}} [[Daniel Barbo\u0159\u00e1k]]\n|-\n|[[File:Adam Gawlas.jpg|100px|alt=Adam Gawlas|frameless]]{{flagicon|CZE}} [[Adam Gawlas]]\n|-\n|[[File:Pavel Jirkal.jpg|100px|alt=Pavel Jirkal|frameless]]{{flagicon|CZE}} [[Pavel Jirkal]]\n|-\n|[[File:Ond\u0159ej Kysilka.jpg|100px|alt=Ond\u0159ej Kysilka|frameless]]{{flagicon|CZE}} [[Ond\u0159ej Kysilka]]\n|-\n|[[File:Alexander Ma\u0161ek.jpg|100px|alt=Alexander Ma\u0161ek|frameless]]{{flagicon|CZE}} [[Alexander Ma\u0161ek]]\n|-\n|[[File:Michal Ondo.jpg|100px|alt=Michal Ondo|frameless]]{{flagicon|CZE}} [[Michal Ondo]]\n|-\n|[[File:David P\u00edsek.jpg|100px|alt=David P\u00edsek|frameless]]{{flagicon|CZE}} [[David P\u00edsek]]\n|-\n|[[File:David Ros\u00ed.jpg|100px|alt=David Ros\u00ed|frameless]]{{flagicon|CZE}} [[David Ros\u00ed]]\n|-\n|[[File:V\u00edt\u011bzslav Sedl\u00e1k.jpg|100px|alt=V\u00edt\u011bzslav Sedl\u00e1k|frameless]]{{flagicon|CZE}} [[V\u00edt\u011bzslav Sedl\u00e1k]]\n|-\n|[[File:Michal \u0160mejda.jpg|100px|alt=Michal \u0160mejda|frameless]]{{flagicon|CZE}} [[Michal \u0160mejda]]\n|}\n\n== League stage ==\n\n=== 7.
