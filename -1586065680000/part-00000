This is usually done by technically inclined video game fans to breathe new life into a cherished old game, as a creative outlet, or to make essentially ''new'' unofficial games using the old game's engine.\n\nROM [[Hacker (hobbyist)|hacking]] is generally accomplished through use of a [[hex editor]] (a program for editing non-textual data) and various specialized tools such as [[tile-based video game|tile]] editors, and game-specific tools which are generally used for editing levels, items, and the like, although more advanced tools such as [[assembly language|assemblers]] and [[debugger]]s are occasionally used.

Although much of the method applies to both types of hacking, this article focuses on \"creative hacking\" such as editing game levels.\n\n==Communities==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Comparebrownred.PNG|frame|Screenshots comparing the world maps in ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Red]]'' (original game, left) and ''Pok\u00e9mon Brown'' (hacked game, right) {{ffdc|1=Comparebrownred.PNG|log=2013 December 20}}]] -->\n\nMost hacking groups offer web space for hosting hacks and screenshots (sometimes only hosting hacks by the group's members, sometimes hosting almost any hack), a message board, and often have an [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]] channel.\n\n==Methods==\nHaving been created by many different programmers or programming teams, ROM data can be very diverse.\n\n===Hex editing===\nA [[hex editor]] is one of the most fundamental tools in any ROM hacker's repertoire. Hex editors are usually used for editing text, and for editing other data for which the structure is known (for example, item properties), and [[#Assembly hacking|Assembly hacking]].\n\nEditing text is one of the most basic forms of hacking. Many games do not store their text in [[ASCII]] form, and because of this, some specialized hex editors have been developed, which can be told what byte values correspond to what letter(s) of the alphabet, to facilitate text editing; a file that defines these byte=letter relationships is called a \"table\" file. Other games use simple text compression techniques (such as [[byte pair encoding]], also called [[dual tile encoding]] or DTE, in which certain combinations of two or more letters are encoded as one byte) which a suitably equipped hex editor can facilitate editing.\n\nA hex editor is the tool of choice for editing things such as character/item properties, if the structure and location of this data is known and there is no game-specific editor for the game that can edit this information. Some intrepid hackers also perform [[#Level editing|level editing]] with a hex editor, but this is extremely difficult (except on games whose level storage format closely resembles how it is presented in a hex editor).\n\n===Graphics editing===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Comparison of Dragon Warrior and Dragoon X Omega.png|thumb|Comparison of battle graphics in ''[[Dragon Warrior]]'' (above) and a hack of it, ''Dragoon X Omega'' (below).  {{deletable image-caption|Friday, 27 December 2013}}]] -->\n\nAnother basic hacking skill is graphics hacking, which is changing the appearance of the game's environments, characters, fonts, or other such things. The format of graphics data varies from console to console, but most of the early ones (NES, Super NES, Game Boy, etc.) store graphics in [[Tile-based video game|tiles]], which are 8x8-[[pixel]] units of data, which are arranged on-screen to produce the desired result. Editing these tiles is also possible with a hex editor, but is generally accomplished with a tile editor (such as [http://info.sonicretro.org/Tile_Layer_Pro ''Tile Layer''] or [https://code.google.com/p/tile-molester/ ''Tile Molester'']), which can display the ROM data in a graphical way, as well as finding and editing tiles.\n\nGraphics hacks can range from simple edits (such as giving [[Luigi]] a [[golf club]]) to \"porting\" characters from one game to another, to full-blown thematic changes (usually with accompanying palette changes; see below).\n\nMore sophisticated graphics hacking involves changing more than just tiles and colors, but also the way in which the tiles are arranged, or tile groups generated, giving more flexibility and control over the final appearance. This is accomplished through hex editing or a specialized tool (either for the specific game or a specific system). A good example of a graphics hack is the uncompleted ''Pok\u00e9mon Torzach'', a hack which attempted to add a whole new generation of Pok\u00e9mon and tiles to the game. The hack has since been discontinued, but it still serves as a good example on what can be achieved with the tools available.\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Advance map screen.png|left|thumb|225px|Screenshot of Advance Map, an editor for Pok\u00e9mon games for the GBA]] -->\n\n===Palette editing===\n\nAnother common form of hacking is ''palette hacking'', where color values are modified to change the colors a player sees in the game (this often goes hand-in-hand with [[#Graphics editing|graphics hacking]]); Palette values are commonly stored in [[Hexadecimal|Hex]]. This is fairly easy for [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] games, the graphics of which use a pre-defined set of colors among which a game selects; palette hacking in this case entails changing which of those colors are selected. The matter is slightly more complicated with [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]] games and games for other systems, which store absolute [[RGB]] color values. Palette editors are usually simple and often are with Level editors, or Game specific graphics editors.\n\n===Level editing===\n\nOne of the most popular forms of ROM hacking, level editing entails modifying or redesigning a game's levels or maps. This is almost exclusively done with an editor specially tailored for a particular game (called a ''[[level editor]]''). Level edits can be done to make the game more challenging, to alter the flow of the game's plot, or just to give something new to an old game. Combined with extensive graphics hacking, the game can take on a very different look and feel.\n\n===Data editing===\n\nA core component of many hacks (especially of [[role-playing video game]]s) is editing data such as character, item, and enemy properties. This is usually done either \"by hand\" (with a hex editor) if the location and structure of the data is known, or with a game-specific editor that has this functionality. Through this, a hacker can alter how weapons work, how strong enemies are or how they act, etc. This can be done to make the game easier or harder, or to create new scenarios for the player to face.\n\n===Assembly hacking===\n\nThe most powerful, and arguably the most difficult, hacking technique is editing the game's actual code, a process called ''ASM hacking'' (\"ASM\" means \"[[assembly language|assembly]]\", referring to the type of programming language used for early video games).<ref name=\"dictionary\"/> There is no set pattern for ASM hacking, as the code varies widely from game to game, but most skilled ASM hackers either use an [[Console emulator|emulator]] equipped with a built-in debugger or tracer, or run the ROM through a [[disassembler]], then analyze the code and modify it using a hex editor or assembler according to their needs. While quite challenging compared to the relatively simple methods listed above, ''anything'' is possible with ASM hacking (of course, within the limits of the hardware/software of the gaming platform), ranging from altering enemy [[Game artificial intelligence|AI]] to changing how graphics are generated. (Of course, the possibilities are still limited by the hacker's ability to comprehend and modify the existing code.)\n\nIf the developers used a [[Programming language#Typed versus untyped languages|typed language]], the hacker may be able to compile their own code for the game in the same language if they have access to a proper compiler. One such example would be using C to hack [[Nintendo 64]] games, since [[MIPS architecture|MIPS]]-[[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] can compile code for the Nintendo 64.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://code.google.com/p/vg64tools/source/browse/#svn/n64/z64actor/trunk |title=vg64tools - Project Hosting on Google Code |publisher=Code.google.com |date= |accessdate=2009-09-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://sites.google.com/site/messiaen64/pong_of_death |title=Super Mario 64: Pong Of Death (messiaen) |publisher=Sites.google.com |date= |accessdate=2009-09-09}}</ref>\n\n===Music hacking===\n\nMusic hacks are relatively rare, due to the wide variety of ways games store music data (hence the difficulty in locating and modifying this data) and the difficulties in composing new music (or porting music from another game). As music cracking is very uncommon, many hacks do not have any ported/composed music added in. The program SapTapper can be used to hack Game Boy Advance music data, however, as many Game Boy Advance games use the M4A Engine (also called \"Sappy Driver\") for music. Various other utilities were created to work with the engine such as [http://www.pokemonhackersonline.com/showthread.php?t=120-Wataru-Kun-s-Ultimate-Pok-mon-Music-Hacking-Guide Sappy 2006].\nAnother instance of the same engine being used between games is on the Nintendo 64, in which most games use the same format; although they use different sound banks. A utility known as the [http://www.goldeneyevault.com/viewfile.php?id=211 N64 Midi Tool] was created to edit the sequences that the majority of Nintendo 64 games use, though it does not cover the first-party N64 titles that use a slightly different engine, such as ''[[Super Mario 64]]''.\nSeveral<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gdri.smspower.org/wiki/index.php/Mega_Drive/Genesis_Sound_Engine_List|title=Mega Drive/Genesis Sound Engine List - GDRI :: Game Developer Research Institute|author=|date=|website=gdri.smspower.org}}</ref> [[Mega Drive]] games use a sound engine unofficially known as \"SMPS\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://segaretro.org/SMPS|title=SMPS - Sega Retro|author=|date=|website=segaretro.org}}</ref>, which has been researched for decades by many hackers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://forums.sonicretro.org/index.php?showtopic=32473|title=Valley Bell's SMPS Research|author=|date=|website=Sonic and Sega Retro Message Board}}</ref> As of today, various<ref>{{cite web|url=http://info.sonicretro.org/Sonic_Hacking_Utilities#Sound_Editors|title=Sonic Hacking Utilities - Sonic Retro|author=|date=|website=info.sonicretro.org}}</ref> tools exist to alter the music of games which use the SMPS engine (''[[Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' games in particular), and many of them made their way to the Steam Workshop.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://steamcommunity.com/workshop/about/?appid=34270|title=Steam Workshop :: SEGA Mega Drive & Genesis Classics|author=|date=|website=steamcommunity.com}}</ref>\n\n===ROM expansion===\n\nGenerally speaking, a ROM hacker cannot normally '''add''' content to a game, but merely '''change''' existing content. This limit can be overcome through ''ROM expansion'', whereby the total size of the ROM image is increased, making room for more content and, in turn, a larger game. The difficulty in doing this varies depending on the system for which the game was made. For example, expanding an NES ROM may be difficult or even impossible due to the [[Multi-Memory Controller|mapper]] used by the game. For example, if a mapper allows 16 ROM banks and all of them are used, expanding the ROM further is impossible without somehow converting the game to another mapper, which could be easy or extremely difficult. On the other hand, expanding a SNES game is (relatively) straightforward. To utilize the added space, parts of the game code have to be modified or re-written (see [[#Assembly hacking|Assembly hacking]] above) so the game knows where to look. Another type of ''ROM expansion'' that is fairly easy is [[Game Boy Advance]] ROMs. The ROMs themselves are generally small, but the memory space available sometimes exceeds it by multiples of up to 17.\n\n==Distribution==\n\nOnce a hack is completed (or an incomplete version is deemed suitable for an interim release) it is released onto the Internet for others to play. The generally accepted way to do this is by making an [[unofficial patch]] (in IPS format or others) that can be applied to the unmodified ROM.<ref name=\"dictionary\"/> This, and usually some form of documentation, is put in an archive file and uploaded somewhere. IPS is a format for recording the differences between two binary files (in this case, between the unmodified and hacked ROMs) and is suitable for ROM hacks. IPS is still used today for small patches\u2014however, as ROMs became larger in size, this format became useless, leading to quite a few file formats being created\u2014such as NINJA and PPF (\"[[PlayStation]] Patch Format\"). PPF is still used today, particularly to patch large files such as ISO CD images and [[Nintendo 64]] games. A new patch format, UPS, has also been developed by the ROM hacking community, designed to be the successor to IPS and PPF.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.romhacking.net/forum/index.php/topic,6059.0.html|title=New patching format, UPS, debuts today|website=www.romhacking.net}}</ref>\nA more recent patching format, the APS patching system, has also been developed by a devoted Game Boy Advance ROM hacker.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pokecommunity.com/member.php?u=28656|title=The Pok\u00e9Community Forums - View Profile: HackMew|website=www.pokecommunity.com}}</ref> The APS system is more space efficient, is reversible, and is faster than its predecessor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pokecommunity.com/showpost.php?p=2488977&postcount=1&highlight#A-Ptch|title= Newest patching format, APS, recently released|website=www.pokecommunity.com}}</ref>\n\nThe purpose of distributing a hack in patch form is to avoid the legal aspects of distributing entire ROM images; the patch records only what has ''changed'' in the ROM, hence distributing it does not usually distribute parts of the original game. A patch is also normally drastically smaller than the full ROM image (an NES ROM can run anywhere from 8 KB to 2&nbsp;MB; a Super NES ROM can run from 256 kB to 6&nbsp;MB).\n\nIn a novel example of legal distribution, Sega released a [[Steam (software)|Steam]]-based virtual hub for its previous collection of Mega Drive/Genesis games, entitled ''[[Sega Mega Drive Classic Collection#Sega Mega Drive Classics Hub|Sega Mega Drive Classics Hub]]''. The ''Hub'', besides allowing players to play emulated versions of these older games, takes advantage of Steam's support for user-created content through Steam Workshop support, officially allowing for ROM hacks of any of the offered classics.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2016-04-29-modders-are-already-having-fun-with-sega-mega-drive-classics-on-steam | title = Modders are already having fun with Sega Mega Drive classics on Steam | first = Wesley | last = Yin-Poole | date = April 29, 2016 | accessdate = May 3, 2016 | work = [[Eurogamer]] }}</ref>\n\n==Usage==\nPatched ROMs are often played on emulators, however it is also possible to play patched ROMs on the original hardware.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://callanbrown.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=59:basic-nes-reproduction-moai-kun&catid=36:home-console-projects&Itemid=61|title=Basic NES Reproduction|publisher=}}</ref> The destination cartridge could be the original cartridge from which the initial unpatched ROM was pulled, or another compatible cartridge of the same type.  This is particularly popular for [[Fan translation (video gaming)|fan translations]], homebrew games, prototypes, or other games for which original cartridges were never produced, or for games which require exact timing or other elements of the original hardware which are not available in emulators.\n\n==Systems and games==\nThe majority of ROM hacking is done on [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] and [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]] games, since such games are small and simple compared to games of more advanced consoles such as the [[Nintendo 64]] or [[Nintendo DS]]. Games for the [[Game Boy]], [[Game Boy Color]] and [[Game Boy Advance]] are also popular for hacking, as well as games for the [[Sega Mega Drive]] and [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] to a lesser extent. Sega Genesis games are also widely hacked. But by no means are games for more recent consoles exempt from hacking, and indeed as computers have become faster and more programs and utilities have been written, more PlayStation, Nintendo 64 and Nintendo DS hacks have emerged.\n\n<!-- This paragraph isn't here to list every single game that has been hacked, just the most commonly hacked ones. -->\nOf these, popular games to play are popular games to hack; many hacks have been released of games of the ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (series)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' series, ''[[Super Mario (series)|Super Mario]]'' series (including ''[[Super Mario 64]]'' and ''[[Super Mario World]]''), ''[[Mario Kart]]'' series (most notably ''[[Super Mario Kart]]'', ''[[Mario Kart Wii]]'', ''[[Mario Kart 7]]'', and ''[[Mario Kart DS]]''), ''[[Pok\u00e9mon (video game series)|Pok\u00e9mon]]'' series, ''[[Chip's Challenge]]'', ''[[Final Fantasy (video game)|Final Fantasy]]'', ''[[The Legend of Zelda (video game)|The Legend of Zelda]]'', games from the ''[[Mega Man (franchise)|Mega Man]]'' series, ''[[Fire Emblem]]'' series, ''[[EarthBound]]'', ''[[Super Metroid]]'', and many others.\n\nA notable hacked arcade game was ''[[Street Fighter II#Updated versions|Street Fighter II Blackbelt Edition]]'', which featured increased game speed and new special moves.

One such example would be using C to hack [[Nintendo 64]] games, since [[MIPS architecture|MIPS]]-[[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] can compile code for the Nintendo 64.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://code.google.com/p/vg64tools/source/browse/#svn/n64/z64actor/trunk |title=vg64tools - Project Hosting on Google Code |publisher=Code.google.com |date= |accessdate=2009-09-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://sites.google.com/site/messiaen64/pong_of_death |title=Super Mario 64: Pong Of Death (messiaen) |publisher=Sites.google.com |date= |accessdate=2009-09-09}}</ref>\n\n===Music hacking===\n\nMusic hacks are relatively rare, due to the wide variety of ways games store music data (hence the difficulty in locating and modifying this data) and the difficulties in composing new music (or porting music from another game). As music cracking is very uncommon, many hacks do not have any ported/composed music added in. The program SapTapper can be used to hack Game Boy Advance music data, however, as many Game Boy Advance games use the M4A Engine (also called \"Sappy Driver\") for music. Various other utilities were created to work with the engine such as [http://www.pokemonhackersonline.com/showthread.php?t=120-Wataru-Kun-s-Ultimate-Pok-mon-Music-Hacking-Guide Sappy 2006].\nAnother instance of the same engine being used between games is on the Nintendo 64, in which most games use the same format; although they use different sound banks. A utility known as the [http://www.goldeneyevault.com/viewfile.php?id=211 N64 Midi Tool] was created to edit the sequences that the majority of Nintendo 64 games use, though it does not cover the first-party N64 titles that use a slightly different engine, such as ''[[Super Mario 64]]''.\nSeveral<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gdri.smspower.org/wiki/index.php/Mega_Drive/Genesis_Sound_Engine_List|title=Mega Drive/Genesis Sound Engine List - GDRI :: Game Developer Research Institute|author=|date=|website=gdri.smspower.org}}</ref> [[Mega Drive]] games use a sound engine unofficially known as \"SMPS\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://segaretro.org/SMPS|title=SMPS - Sega Retro|author=|date=|website=segaretro.org}}</ref>, which has been researched for decades by many hackers<ref>{{cite web|url=http://forums.sonicretro.org/index.php?showtopic=32473|title=Valley Bell's SMPS Research|author=|date=|website=Sonic and Sega Retro Message Board}}</ref>. As of today, various<ref>{{cite web|url=http://info.sonicretro.org/Sonic_Hacking_Utilities#Sound_Editors|title=Sonic Hacking Utilities - Sonic Retro|author=|date=|website=info.sonicretro.org}}</ref> tools exist to alter the music of games which use the SMPS engine (''[[Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' games in particular), and many of them made their way to the Steam Workshop<ref>{{cite web|url=http://steamcommunity.com/workshop/about/?appid=34270|title=Steam Workshop :: SEGA Mega Drive & Genesis Classics|author=|date=|website=steamcommunity.com}}</ref>.\n\n===ROM expansion===\n\nGenerally speaking, a ROM hacker cannot normally '''add''' content to a game, but merely '''change''' existing content. This limit can be overcome through ''ROM expansion'', whereby the total size of the ROM image is increased, making room for more content and, in turn, a larger game. The difficulty in doing this varies depending on the system for which the game was made. For example, expanding an NES ROM may be difficult or even impossible due to the [[Multi-Memory Controller|mapper]] used by the game. For example, if a mapper allows 16 ROM banks and all of them are used, expanding the ROM further is impossible without somehow converting the game to another mapper, which could be easy or extremely difficult. On the other hand, expanding a SNES game is (relatively) straightforward. To utilize the added space, parts of the game code have to be modified or re-written (see [[#Assembly hacking|Assembly hacking]] above) so the game knows where to look. Another type of ''ROM expansion'' that is fairly easy is [[Game Boy Advance]] ROMs. The ROMs themselves are generally small, but the memory space available sometimes exceeds it by multiples of up to 17.\n\n==Distribution==\n\nOnce a hack is completed (or an incomplete version is deemed suitable for an interim release) it is released onto the Internet for others to play. The generally accepted way to do this is by making an [[unofficial patch]] (in IPS format or others) that can be applied to the unmodified ROM.<ref name=\"dictionary\"/> This, and usually some form of documentation, is put in an archive file and uploaded somewhere. IPS is a format for recording the differences between two binary files (in this case, between the unmodified and hacked ROMs) and is suitable for ROM hacks. IPS is still used today for small patches\u2014however, as ROMs became larger in size, this format became useless, leading to quite a few file formats being created\u2014such as NINJA and PPF (\"[[PlayStation]] Patch Format\"). PPF is still used today, particularly to patch large files such as ISO CD images and [[Nintendo 64]] games. A new patch format, UPS, has also been developed by the ROM hacking community, designed to be the successor to IPS and PPF.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.romhacking.net/forum/index.php/topic,6059.0.html|title=New patching format, UPS, debuts today|website=www.romhacking.net}}</ref>\nA more recent patching format, the APS patching system, has also been developed by a devoted Game Boy Advance ROM hacker.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pokecommunity.com/member.php?u=28656|title=The Pok\u00e9Community Forums - View Profile: HackMew|website=www.pokecommunity.com}}</ref> The APS system is more space efficient, is reversible, and is faster than its predecessor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pokecommunity.com/showpost.php?p=2488977&postcount=1&highlight#A-Ptch|title= Newest patching format, APS, recently released|website=www.pokecommunity.com}}</ref>\n\nThe purpose of distributing a hack in patch form is to avoid the legal aspects of distributing entire ROM images; the patch records only what has ''changed'' in the ROM, hence distributing it does not usually distribute parts of the original game. A patch is also normally drastically smaller than the full ROM image (an NES ROM can run anywhere from 8 KB to 2&nbsp;MB; a Super NES ROM can run from 256 kB to 6&nbsp;MB).\n\nIn a novel example of legal distribution, Sega released a [[Steam (software)|Steam]]-based virtual hub for its previous collection of Mega Drive/Genesis games, entitled ''[[Sega Mega Drive Classic Collection#Sega Mega Drive Classics Hub|Sega Mega Drive Classics Hub]]''. The ''Hub'', besides allowing players to play emulated versions of these older games, takes advantage of Steam's support for user-created content through Steam Workshop support, officially allowing for ROM hacks of any of the offered classics.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2016-04-29-modders-are-already-having-fun-with-sega-mega-drive-classics-on-steam | title = Modders are already having fun with Sega Mega Drive classics on Steam | first = Wesley | last = Yin-Poole | date = April 29, 2016 | accessdate = May 3, 2016 | work = [[Eurogamer]] }}</ref>\n\n==Usage==\nPatched ROMs are often played on emulators, however it is also possible to play patched ROMs on the original hardware.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://callanbrown.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=59:basic-nes-reproduction-moai-kun&catid=36:home-console-projects&Itemid=61|title=Basic NES Reproduction|publisher=}}</ref> The destination cartridge could be the original cartridge from which the initial unpatched ROM was pulled, or another compatible cartridge of the same type.  This is particularly popular for [[Fan translation (video gaming)|fan translations]], homebrew games, prototypes, or other games for which original cartridges were never produced, or for games which require exact timing or other elements of the original hardware which are not available in emulators.\n\n==Systems and games==\nThe majority of ROM hacking is done on [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] and [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]] games, since such games are small and simple compared to games of more advanced consoles such as the [[Nintendo 64]] or [[Nintendo DS]]. Games for the [[Game Boy]], [[Game Boy Color]] and [[Game Boy Advance]] are also popular for hacking, as well as games for the [[Sega Mega Drive]] and [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] to a lesser extent. Sega Genesis games are also widely hacked. But by no means are games for more recent consoles exempt from hacking, and indeed as computers have become faster and more programs and utilities have been written, more PlayStation, Nintendo 64 and Nintendo DS hacks have emerged.\n\n<!-- This paragraph isn't here to list every single game that has been hacked, just the most commonly hacked ones. -->\nOf these, popular games to play are popular games to hack; many hacks have been released of games of the ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (series)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' series, ''[[Super Mario (series)|Super Mario]]'' series (including ''[[Super Mario 64]]'' and ''[[Super Mario World]]''), ''[[Mario Kart]]'' series (most notably ''[[Super Mario Kart]]'', ''[[Mario Kart Wii]]'', ''[[Mario Kart 7]]'', and ''[[Mario Kart DS]]''), ''[[Pok\u00e9mon (video game series)|Pok\u00e9mon]]'' series, ''[[Chip's Challenge]]'', ''[[Final Fantasy (video game)|Final Fantasy]]'', ''[[The Legend of Zelda (video game)|The Legend of Zelda]]'', games from the ''[[Mega Man (franchise)|Mega Man]]'' series, ''[[Fire Emblem]]'' series, ''[[EarthBound]]'', ''[[Super Metroid]]'', and many others.\n\nA notable hacked arcade game was ''[[Street Fighter II#Updated versions|Street Fighter II Blackbelt Edition]]'', which featured increased game speed and new special moves.

San Francisco de Macor\u00eds has hills to the north which provide a great view of the city during evening hours.  The Jaya River is prominent on the western part of town.\n\n=== Relief ===\nThe relief of Duarte Province ranges from {{convert|17|to|942|m|ft|0}} above sea level, reaching its highest elevation at \"Loma Quita Espuela\". This name allegedly comes from the time when the Spaniards were exploring the island, since the hill was too steep to ride their horses, they had to dismount and remove their spurs and undertake the ascent on foot. There are two main geologic regions: the north slope of the Cordillera Septentrional and the rough topography of the Delta del Yuna.\n\nOn the southern slope of the Cibao Valley in the Yuna Subregion (Easter Cibao), we will find alluvial fans, in combination with deposit hollows, hill areas and platforms, and also alluvial soils into the channels of the flows of the rivers Cam\u00fa and Yuna.\n\n==== Faults ====\nTwo faults go through the Duarte Province from east to west. This tectonic deformations are the Septentrional fault, that touches the towns of Arenoso, Castillo and San Francisco de Macor\u00eds and the Cibao fault passing through the towns of Las Guaranas, Castillo, Villa Riva Pimentel. The Septentrional fault is located in the northern part of the province while the Cibao fault is located in the southern part of it.\n\n=== Geomorphology ===\nYuna River Delta.\nIt is part of the Cibao Valley, and most of these areas are located a few metres [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]] and therefore wetlands abound. Its main rivers are the Great Yuna and Ca\u00f1o Estero, which is the natural drainage of these lands in the province of Maria Trinidad Sanchez. Consists mainly of swamps with silt and clay, are also large areas of peat deposits. By the rivers are alluvial.\n\nEastern Cibao Valley (Also part of the Cibao Valle).\nIt is divided into the provinces of Santiago, Espaillat, S\u00e1nchez Ram\u00edrez, S\u00e1nchez and Duarte, the latter having a higher percentage (about 50%). All cities in this province are rooted in this valley except the city of Arenoso. The floodplains of the Yuna River system occupy a narrow strip on the south side of the valley and there is also a narrow chain of hills probably middle Miocene limestones adjacent to the North mountain range.

San Francisco de Macor\u00eds has hills to the north which provide a great view of the city during evening hours.  The Jaya River is prominent on the western part of town.\n\n=== Relief ===\nThe relief of Duarte Province ranges from {{convert|17|to|942|m|ft|0}} above sea level, reaching its highest elevation at \"Loma Quita Espuela\". This name allegedly comes from the time when the Spaniards were exploring the island, since the hill was too steep to ride their horses, they had to dismount and remove their spurs and undertake the ascent on foot. There are two main geologic regions: the north slope of the Cordillera Septentrional and the rough topography of the Delta del Yuna.\n\nOn the southern slope of the Cibao Valley in the Yuna Subregion (Easter Cibao), we will find alluvial fans, in combination with deposit hollows, hill areas and platforms, and also alluvial soils into the channels of the flows of the rivers Cam\u00fa and Yuna.\n\n==== Faults ====\nTwo faults go through the Duarte Province from east to west. This tectonic deformations are the Septentrional fault, that touches the towns of Arenoso, Castillo and San Francisco de Macor\u00eds and the Cibao fault passing through the towns of Las Guaranas, Castillo, Villa Riva Pimentel. The Septentrional fault is located in the northern part of the province while the Cibao fault is located in the southern part of it.\n\n=== Geomorphology ===\nYuna River Delta.\nIt is part of the Cibao Valley, and most of these areas are located a few metres [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]] and therefore wetlands abound. Its main rivers are the Great Yuna and Ca\u00f1o Estero, which is the natural drainage of these lands in the province of Maria Trinidad Sanchez. Consists mainly of swamps with silt and clay, are also large areas of peat deposits. By the rivers are alluvial.\n\nEastern Cibao Valley (Also part of the Cibao Valle).\nIt is divided into the provinces of Santiago, Espaillat, S\u00e1nchez Ram\u00edrez, S\u00e1nchez and Duarte, the latter having a higher percentage (about 50%). All cities in this province are rooted in this valley except the city of Arenoso. The floodplains of the Yuna River system occupy a narrow strip on the south side of the valley and there is also a narrow chain of hills probably middle Miocene limestones adjacent to the North mountain range. For this province the valley also has marine lacustrine deposits of clay, basically of two kinds: a limestone and other no calcareous.\n\nThe Haitises.\nThey consist of a karst platform, which is composed of hard limestone from the Oligocene-Miocene. The highest elevations are generally {{convert|200|to|250|m|ft|0}}tall. The Payabo River crosses the region by a narrow channel filled with alluvial deposits.\n\nNorthern Range.\nIt is a mountain range of sedimentary rocks and highly faulted and folded fob\u00e1ceas. In this province the Northern Range reaches heights of {{convert|942|m|ft|0}} (Quita Espuela); near San Francisco de Macor\u00eds the ridge height is slightly below {{convert|300|m|ft|0}}. It presents some mudstone, limestone and Miocene and Eocene oligoc\u00e9nicos. To the south of Gaspar Hernandez and reaching the Nagua River there is a very complex area with rugged hills of limestone, tuff and probably with other volcanic and metamorphic rocks, mainly of Upper Cretaceous.\n\n=== Hydrography ===\nThere are many rivers and streams in the Duarte Province, being the most important ones: the [[Cam\u00fa River]], the [[Yuna River]] and their tributaries (Jaya, Cuaba, Nigua, Payabo, among others). The Yuna River and Cam\u00fa  River constitute important sources of water, both for drinking as irrigation.\n\n=== Physiography and environment ===\nEnvironmental pollution in Duarte Province is the product of several elements such as the poor state of the latrines, untreated sewage, overflow of streams, indiscriminate use of agrochemicals, backwaters and installation of pigsties on the banks of rivers, as well as litter and some factories in the province that are thrown into rivers.\n\nSoil erosion from deforestation also affects the environment of the Duarte Province. Similarly, the smoke from factories and from burning trash, specifically in the municipality of San Francisco de Macoris, is affecting its inhabitants\n\n===Climate===\nTemperatures fluctuate between {{convert|17|to|32|C|F|0}}, with cooler temperatures affected by rainfall.  It is largely an isolated paradise since much of the territory is unaffected by hurricanes or extremely hot weather.  Occasional floods can occur due to a rainy season which manifests itself mostly during the month of May.\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = San Francisco de Macor\u00eds (1961\u20131990)\n|metric first = yes\n|single line = yes\n|Jan record high C = 37.2\n|Feb record high C = 35.0\n|Mar record high C = 36.5\n|Apr record high C = 37.4\n|May record high C = 37.5\n|Jun record high C = 37.5\n|Jul record high C = 38.0\n|Aug record high C = 38.5\n|Sep record high C = 39.5\n|Oct record high C = 39.6\n|Nov record high C = 38.5\n|Dec record high C = 39.5\n|year record high C = 39.6\n|Jan high C = 28.3\n|Feb high C = 28.7\n|Mar high C = 29.6\n|Apr high C = 30.5\n|May high C = 30.9\n|Jun high C = 31.7\n|Jul high C = 31.9\n|Aug high C = 32.0\n|Sep high C = 32.2\n|Oct high C = 31.9\n|Nov high C = 29.9\n|Dec high C = 28.6\n|year high C = 30.5\n|Jan low C = 17.7\n|Feb low C = 17.4\n|Mar low C = 17.7\n|Apr low C = 18.7\n|May low C = 20.0\n|Jun low C = 20.6\n|Jul low C = 20.8\n|Aug low C = 20.6\n|Sep low C = 20.5\n|Oct low C = 20.1\n|Nov low C = 19.4\n|Dec low C = 18.4\n|year low C = 19.3\n|Jan record low C = 12.2\n|Feb record low C = 12.0\n|Mar record low C = 10.2\n|Apr record low C = 12.3\n|May record low C = 14.0\n|Jun record low C = 16.0\n|Jul record low C = 12.9\n|Aug record low C = 16.0\n|Sep record low C = 16.4\n|Oct record low C = 16.4\n|Nov record low C = 15.0\n|Dec record low C = 12.7\n|year record low C = 10.2\n|rain colour = green\n|Jan rain mm = 82.1\n|Feb rain mm = 72.8\n|Mar rain mm = 64.6\n|Apr rain mm = 97.2\n|May rain mm = 192.6\n|Jun rain mm = 115.8\n|Jul rain mm = 125.8\n|Aug rain mm = 163.2\n|Sep rain mm = 121.8\n|Oct rain mm = 128.1\n|Nov rain mm = 173.6\n|Dec rain mm = 110.4\n|year rain mm = 1448.0\n|unit rain days = 1.0 mm\n|Jan rain days = 8.8\n|Feb rain days = 7.2\n|Mar rain days = 8.2\n|Apr rain days = 8.0\n|May rain days = 12.6\n|Jun rain days = 9.7\n|Jul rain days = 12.2\n|Aug rain days = 12.0\n|Sep rain days = 9.5\n|Oct rain days = 9.9\n|Nov rain days = 12.6\n|Dec rain days = 11.0\n|year rain days = 121.7\n|source 1 = [[NOAA]]<ref name= NOAA >{{cite web \n| url = ftp://ftp.atdd.noaa.gov/pub/GCOS/WMO-Normals/TABLES/REG_IV/DR/00000045.TXT\n| title = S.

He was a specialist on the flies, [[Diptera]].\n\nHe is remembered for '''Williston's law''', which states that parts in an organism, such as arthropod limbs, become reduced in number and specialized in function through evolutionary history.\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Samuel Wendell Williston.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Williston in 1891]] \nWilliston was born in Boston, Massachusetts to Samuel Williston and Jane A. Williston [[n\u00e9e]] Turner. As a young child, Williston's family travelled to [[Kansas Territory]] in 1857 under the auspices of the [[New England Emigrant Aid Company]] to help fight the extension of slavery. He was raised in [[Manhattan, Kansas]], attended public [[Manhattan High School|high school]] there, and graduated from Kansas State Agricultural College (now [[Kansas State University]]) in 1872, afterwards receiving a [[Master of Arts|Magister Artium]] from that institution.<ref name=\"Blackmar1912\">Blackmar 1912.</ref>\n\nIn 1874, he went on his first field fossil hunting expedition for [[Othniel Charles Marsh]] at [[Yale University]] under the mentorship of [[Benjamin Franklin Mudge]], and led his first expedition in 1877.<ref name=\"Williston1898\">Williston 1898.</ref> With Mudge, Williston discovered the first fossils of the [[dinosaur]]s ''[[Allosaurus]]'' and ''[[Diplodocus]]''. He was noted for painstakingly illustrating the finds. In 1880, he matriculated to [[Yale University]], for several years was a post-graduate student and faculty member. Around this time, he proposed the first explicit model for the terrestrial origin of [[bird flight]] (i.e., that dinosaurs developed flight by running along the ground rather than jumping from trees).\n\nWilliston returned to [[Kansas]] in 1890, to take a position on the faculty at the [[University of Kansas]] as a professor of [[geology]] and [[anatomy]].<ref name=\"Blackmar1912\"/>  In 1899, he was named the first Dean of the new [[University of Kansas School of Medicine|School of Medicine]] there. He was also a member of the state boards of health and medical examiners. In 1902, Williston left Kansas again, and took the chair of paleontology at the [[University of Chicago]].\n\nWilliston was a fellow of the [[Geological Society of America]] and foreign correspondent for the London Geological and Zo\u00f6logical societies. He was president of the Kansas Academy of Science, and in 1903 became president of the [[Society of Vertebrate Paleontology]]. He was the author of several books, and the [[Smithsonian Institution]] now administers an endowment fund in his name.\n\n==Work on Diptera==\nAlthough never employed as a professional [[Entomology|entomologist]], Samuel W.

He became the first North American specialist on this group, publishing over 50 books and papers, and naming more than 1250 species.

Doe {{!}} president of Liberia|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2019-05-14}}</ref> \u2013 September 9, 1990) was a [[Liberia]]n politician who served as the Liberian leader from 1980 to 1990, first as a military leader and later as a politician.<ref name=\":0\" /> While a [[master sergeant]] in the [[Armed Forces of Liberia]] (AFL), Doe staged a violent [[coup d'etat]] in April 1980 that left him ''[[de facto]]'' head of state.<ref name=\":0\" /> During the coup, then president [[William Tolbert]], and much of the [[True Whig Party]] leadership were executed.<ref name=\":0\" /> Doe then established the [[People's Redemption Council]], assuming the rank of [[General officer|general]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nDoe suspended the constitution and headed the country's [[military junta]] for the next five years.<ref name=\":0\" /> In 1985 he ordered an election and officially became the [[President of Liberia#List of Presidents of Liberia|21st]] [[President of Liberia]]. The election was marked by controversy as there was evidence of [[election fraud]].<ref name=\":0\" /> Doe had support from the [[United States]]; it was a strategic alliance due to his anti-[[Soviet Union|Soviet]] stance taken during the years of the [[Cold War]] prior to the [[Revolutions of 1989|changes in 1989]] that led to the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]].\n\nThe first native head of state in the country's history, Doe was a member of the [[Krahn people|Krahn]] ethnic group, a largely rural people. Before the 1980 coup, natives had often held a marginal role in society, which was dominated by the descendants of the [[Americo-Liberians|Americo-Liberian]] Pioneers; composed primarily of free-born American blacks and freed slaves, the Pioneers were the immigrants who had established Liberia in the 1820s and led the country beginning with independence in 1847.\n\nDoe opened Liberian ports to [[Canada|Canadian]], [[China|Chinese]] and [[Europe]]an ships. This brought in considerable foreign investment from foreign shipping firms and earned Liberia a reputation as a [[tax haven]].\n\nDoe attempted to legitimize his regime with passage of a new [[Constitution of Liberia|constitution]] in 1984 and [[1985 Liberian general election|elections]] in 1985. However, opposition to his rule increased, especially after the 1985 elections, which were declared to be fraudulent by most foreign observers. For political reasons, the US continued to support him.\n\nIn the late 1980s, as the US government adopted more [[austerity|fiscal austerity]] and the threat of Communism declined with the waning of the Cold War, the U.S. became disenchanted with the entrenched corruption of Doe's government and began cutting off critical foreign aid. This, combined with the popular anger generated by Doe's favoritism toward Krahns, placed him in a very precarious position.\n\nA [[First Liberian Civil War|civil war]] began in December 1989, when rebels entered Liberia through [[Ivory Coast]], capturing and overthrowing Doe on 9 September 1990. He was tortured during interrogation and murdered by his conqueror, [[Prince Johnson]], one time ally of [[Charles Taylor (Liberian politician)|Charles Taylor]], in an internationally televised display.\n\n== Early life ==\nOn May 6, 1951 Doe was born in [[Tuzon]], a small inland village in [[Grand Gedeh County]]. His family belonged to the [[Krahn people]], a minority indigenous group important in this area.<ref>\"Hail to the Chief: Happy Birthday!\" ''Express Special'' 1982-05-06: 1.</ref> At the age of sixteen, Doe finished elementary school and enrolled at a Baptist junior high school in [[Zwedru]].\n\nTwo years later, he enlisted in the [[Armed Forces of Liberia]], hoping thereby to obtain a scholarship to a high school in [[Kakata]], but instead he was assigned to military duties.  Over the next ten years, he was assigned to a range of duty stations, including education at a military school and commanding an assortment of garrisons and prisons in Monrovia.  He finally completed high school by [[Distance education|correspondence]]. Doe was promoted to the grade of [[Master sergeant]] on 11 October 1979 and made an administrator for the Third Battalion in Monrovia, which position he occupied for eleven months.<ref name=\"1984 birthday\">\"Happy Birthday!!

Tolbert, Jr.]] His forces killed another 26 of Tolbert's supporters in the fighting. Thirteen members of the Cabinet were publicly executed ten days later. Other public demonstrations were made to show his power and humiliate Tolbert's people before killing them. Shortly after the coup, government ministers were walked publicly around Monrovia in the nude and then summarily executed by a firing squad on the beach.<ref>{{cite news|last=White|first=Robin|title=My Verbal Sparring with Charles Taylor|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-17845592|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=26 April 2012|date=April 26, 2012}}</ref> Hundreds of government workers fled the country, while others were imprisoned.\n\nAfter the coup, Doe assumed the rank of general and established a People's Redemption Council (PRC), composed of himself and 14 other low-ranking officers, to rule the country. The early days of the regime were marked by mass executions of members of Tolbert's deposed government. Doe ordered the release of about 50 leaders of the opposition [[Progressive Alliance of Liberia|Progressive People's Party]], who had been jailed by Tolbert during the rice riots of the previous month.\n\nShortly after that, Doe ordered the arrest of 91 officials of the Tolbert regime. Within days, 11 former members of Tolbert's cabinet, including his brother Frank, were brought to trial to answer charges of \"high [[treason]], rampant [[corruption]] and gross violation of [[human rights]].\"<ref>{{cite journal |journal=TIME Magazine |date=1980-04-18 |title=LIBERIA: After the Takeover, Revenge |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,924057,00.html#ixzz0dsadsRgy}}</ref> Doe suspended the Constitution, allowing these trials to be conducted by a Commission appointed by the state's new military leadership, with defendants being refused both [[legal representation]] and [[trial by jury]], virtually ensuring their conviction.\n\nDoe abruptly ended 133 years of Americo-Liberian political domination. Some hailed the coup as the first time since Liberia's establishment as a country that it was governed by people of native African descent instead of by the Americo-Liberian elite. Other persons without Americo-Liberian heritage had held the Vice Presidency ([[Henry Too Wesley]]), as well as Ministerial and Legislative positions in years prior. Many people welcomed Doe's takeover as a shift favoring the majority of the population that had largely been excluded from participation in government since the establishment of the country.\n\nHowever, the new government, led by the leaders of the ''coup d'\u00e9tat'' and calling itself the [[People's Redemption Council]] (PRC), lacked experience and was ill-prepared to rule. Doe became head of state and suspended the constitution, but promised a return to civilian rule by 1985.\n<!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:Samuel K.

He styled himself \"Dr. Doe\" starting in 1982, after making a state visit to [[Chun Doo-hwan]] in South Korea and being awarded an honorary doctorate from the [[University of Seoul]].<ref name=\"1984 birthday\" />  After seven years of calling himself a doctor, Doe announced in 1989 that he had completed a bachelor's degree from the [[University of Liberia]].<ref>\"Congrats Mr. President!\" ''Monrovia Tribune'', 1989-05: 1/12.</ref>\n\n=== Relations with the United States ===\n[[File:Secretary of Defense Caspar W. Weinberger - Samuel K. Doe.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Doe with then Secretary of Defense of the United States [[Caspar W. Weinberger]] outside the [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]] in 1982]]\nDuring his first years in office, Doe openly supported U.S. [[Cold War]] foreign policy in Africa during the 1980s, severing diplomatic relations between Liberia and the [[Soviet Union]].\n\nThe United States valued Liberia as an important ally during the Cold War, as it helped to contain the spread of Soviet influence in Africa.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} As part of the expanding relationship, Doe agreed to a modification of the mutual defense pact granting staging rights on 24-hour notice at Liberia's sea and airports for the [[United States Rapid Deployment Forces|U.S. Rapid Deployment Forces]], which were established to respond swiftly to security threats around the world.\n\n=== New constitution and 1985 elections ===\nA draft constitution providing for a multi-party republic was issued in 1983 and approved by referendum in 1984. On July 26, 1984, Doe was elected President of the Interim National Assembly.<ref>Europa World Year Book 1985</ref> He had a new constitution approved by [[1984 Liberian constitutional referendum|referendum]] in 1984 and went on to stage a [[1985 Liberian general election|presidential election]] on October 15, 1985.  According to official figures, Doe won 51% of the vote\u2014just enough to avoid a runoff.<ref>Moran, Mary H.

However, most of the elected opposition candidates refused to take their seats.\n\nThe election was heavily rigged; Doe had the ballots taken to a secret location and 50 of his own handpicked staff counted them. Foreign observers declared the elections fraudulent and suggested that runner-up [[Jackson Doe]] of the [[Liberian Action Party]] had actually won.<ref>Gifford, Paul. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=GFZ_TIc4q6UC Christianity and Politics in Doe's Liberia]''. [[Cambridge]]: [[Cambridge University Press]], 1993, 22.</ref> Also, prior to the election he had more than 50 of his political opponents murdered. It is also alleged that he changed his official birth date from 1951 to 1950 in order to meet the new constitution's requirement that the president be at least 35 years old. Doe was formally sworn in on January 6, 1986.\n\n=== Increased repression ===\n\nGen. [[Thomas Quiwonkpa]], who had been a leader of the 1980 coup along with Doe, attempted to seize power on November 12, 1985; the attempt failed after fighting in [[Monrovia]] in which Quiwonkpa was killed. Doe also announced in a radio and television broadcast in this West African nation that anyone found on the streets after a 6 p.m. curfew will be considered a rebel and executed immediately.<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/13/world/liberia-says-it-foiled-coup-attempt.html</ref><ref>https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1985-11-16-mn-2771-story.html</ref>\n\nDoe's corrupt and totalitarian government became even more repressive after the attempted coup, shutting down newspapers and banning political activity. The government's mistreatment of certain ethnic groups, particularly the [[Gio people|Gio]] (or Dan) and the [[Mano people|Mano]] in the north (Quiwonkpa was an ethnic Gio), resulted in divisions and violence among indigenous populations who until then had coexisted relatively peacefully.\n\n== Murder ==\n[[Charles Taylor (Liberian politician)|Charles Taylor]], a former ally of Doe, crossed into Liberia from [[Ivory Coast]] on December 24, 1989, to wage a [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla war]] against Doe. Taylor had broken out of a jail in the United States, where he was awaiting extradition to Liberia on charges of embezzlement. The conflict quickly flared into [[First Liberian Civil War|full-fledged civil war]].  By mid-1990, most of Liberia was controlled by rebel factions.\n\nDoe was captured in [[Monrovia]] on September 9, 1990, by [[Prince Johnson|Prince Y. Johnson]], leader of [[Independent National Patriotic Front of Liberia|INPFL]], a breakaway faction of Taylor's [[National Patriotic Front of Liberia|NPFL]]. [[Arnold Quainoo|General Quinoo]], the head of [[ECOMOG]], had invited Doe to the ECOMOG headquarters for a meeting and assured him of his safety from the rebels. On the morning of September 9, 1990, Doe arrived at a precarious time during an ongoing change in guard duty from the well-armed and better equipped Nigerian team of peacekeepers to the weaker Gambian contingent. The Nigerian team had just withdrawn from the scene when Doe's convoy of lightly armed personnel arrived, none of whom were anticipating any trouble. Doe was escorted to General Quinoo's office where he was formally welcomed, while most of his team of aides and guards waited outside. Johnson's rebels surprised everyone by suddenly arriving on the scene uninvited and heavily armed, overwhelming and disarming the entirety of Doe's team while encountering no resistance. They then started shooting Doe's team individually and later in groups. Upon hearing the gunshots from outside, Doe expressed concern to Quinoo, who assured him that all was fine. Quinoo later excused himself to check on what was happening outside and was followed by his aide, Captain Coker of the [[Gambia]]n contingent. Both men took cover upon assessing the situation. Johnson's men moved indoors, finished off Doe's remaining team, shot him in the leg, and took him captive. When the dust settled, over 80 of Doe's men lay dead. Coker characterized the incident not as a fight, but a brutal massacre. Remarkably, none of the ECOMOG personnel were shot in the carnage.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}} Doe was taken to Johnson's military base and [[torture]]d before being killed and exposed naked in the streets of Monrovia where they spilled dirty water on his head.<ref>https://twitter.com/NzekweGerald/status/1086901261197328384</ref> To prove that he was not protected by black magic,<ref name=wp>Vick, Karl.

Doe {{!}} president of Liberia|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2019-05-14}}</ref> \u2013 September 9, 1990) was a [[Liberia]]n politician who served as the Liberian leader from 1980 to 1990, first as a military leader and later as a politician.<ref name=\":0\" /> While a [[master sergeant]] in the [[Armed Forces of Liberia]] (AFL), Doe staged a violent [[coup d'etat]] in April 1980 that left him ''[[de facto]]'' head of state.<ref name=\":0\" /> During the coup, then president [[William Tolbert]], and much of the [[True Whig Party]] leadership were executed.<ref name=\":0\" /> Doe then established the [[People's Redemption Council]], assuming the rank of [[General officer|general]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nDoe suspended the constitution and headed the country's [[military junta]] for the next five years.<ref name=\":0\" /> In 1985 he ordered an election and officially became the [[President of Liberia#List of Presidents of Liberia|21st]] [[President of Liberia]]. The election was marked by controversy as there was evidence of [[election fraud]].<ref name=\":0\" /> Doe had support from the [[United States]]; it was a strategic alliance due to his anti-[[Soviet Union|Soviet]] stance taken during the years of the [[Cold War]] prior to the [[Revolutions of 1989|changes in 1989]] that led to the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]].\n\nThe first native head of state in the country's history, Doe was a member of the [[Krahn people|Krahn]] ethnic group, a largely rural people. Before the 1980 coup, natives had often held a marginal role in society, which was dominated by the descendants of the [[Americo-Liberians|Americo-Liberian]] Pioneers; composed primarily of free-born American blacks and freed slaves, the Pioneers were the immigrants who had established Liberia in the 1820s and led the country beginning with independence in 1847.\n\nDoe opened Liberian ports to [[Canada|Canadian]], [[China|Chinese]] and [[Europe]]an ships. This brought in considerable foreign investment from foreign shipping firms and earned Liberia a reputation as a [[tax haven]].\n\nDoe attempted to legitimize his regime with passage of a new [[Constitution of Liberia|constitution]] in 1984 and [[1985 Liberian general election|elections]] in 1985. However, opposition to his rule increased, especially after the 1985 elections, which were declared to be fraudulent by most foreign observers. For political reasons, the US continued to support him.\n\nIn the late 1980s, as the US government adopted more [[austerity|fiscal austerity]] and the threat of Communism declined with the waning of the Cold War, the U.S. became disenchanted with the entrenched corruption of Doe's government and began cutting off critical foreign aid. This, combined with the popular anger generated by Doe's favoritism toward Krahns, placed him in a very precarious position.\n\nA [[First Liberian Civil War|civil war]] began in December 1989, when rebels entered Liberia through [[Ivory Coast]], capturing and overthrowing Doe on 9 September 1990. He was tortured during interrogation and murdered by his conqueror, [[Prince Johnson]], one time ally of [[Charles Taylor (Liberian politician)|Charles Taylor]], in an internationally televised display.\n\n== Early life ==\nOn May 6, 1951 Doe was born in [[Tuzon]], a small inland village in [[Grand Gedeh County]]. His family belonged to the [[Krahn people]], a minority indigenous group important in this area.<ref>\"Hail to the Chief: Happy Birthday!\" ''Express Special'' 1982-05-06: 1.</ref> At the age of sixteen, Doe finished elementary school and enrolled at a Baptist junior high school in [[Zwedru]].\n\nTwo years later, he enlisted in the [[Armed Forces of Liberia]], hoping thereby to obtain a scholarship to a high school in [[Kakata]], but instead he was assigned to military duties.  Over the next ten years, he was assigned to a range of duty stations, including education at a military school and commanding an assortment of garrisons and prisons in Monrovia.  He finally completed high school by [[Distance education|correspondence]]. Doe was promoted to the grade of [[Master sergeant]] on 11 October 1979 and made an administrator for the Third Battalion in Monrovia, which position he occupied for eleven months.<ref name=\"1984 birthday\">\"Happy Birthday!!

Tolbert, Jr.]] His forces killed another 26 of Tolbert's supporters in the fighting. Thirteen members of the Cabinet were publicly executed ten days later. Other public demonstrations were made to show his power and humiliate Tolbert's people before killing them. Shortly after the coup, government ministers were walked publicly around Monrovia in the nude and then summarily executed by a firing squad on the beach.<ref>{{cite news|last=White|first=Robin|title=My Verbal Sparring with Charles Taylor|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-17845592|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=26 April 2012|date=April 26, 2012}}</ref> Hundreds of government workers fled the country, while others were imprisoned.\n\nAfter the coup, Doe assumed the rank of general and established a People's Redemption Council (PRC), composed of himself and 14 other low-ranking officers, to rule the country. The early days of the regime were marked by mass executions of members of Tolbert's deposed government. Doe ordered the release of about 50 leaders of the opposition [[Progressive Alliance of Liberia|Progressive People's Party]], who had been jailed by Tolbert during the rice riots of the previous month.\n\nShortly after that, Doe ordered the arrest of 91 officials of the Tolbert regime. Within days, 11 former members of Tolbert's cabinet, including his brother Frank, were brought to trial to answer charges of \"high [[treason]], rampant [[corruption]] and gross violation of [[human rights]].\"<ref>{{cite journal |journal=TIME Magazine |date=1980-04-18 |title=LIBERIA: After the Takeover, Revenge |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,924057,00.html#ixzz0dsadsRgy}}</ref> Doe suspended the Constitution, allowing these trials to be conducted by a Commission appointed by the state's new military leadership, with defendants being refused both [[legal representation]] and [[trial by jury]], virtually ensuring their conviction.\n\nDoe abruptly ended 133 years of Americo-Liberian political domination. Some hailed the coup as the first time since Liberia's establishment as a country that it was governed by people of native African descent instead of by the Americo-Liberian elite. Other persons without Americo-Liberian heritage had held the Vice Presidency ([[Henry Too Wesley]]), as well as Ministerial and Legislative positions in years prior. Many people welcomed Doe's takeover as a shift favoring the majority of the population that had largely been excluded from participation in government since the establishment of the country.\n\nHowever, the new government, led by the leaders of the ''coup d'\u00e9tat'' and calling itself the [[People's Redemption Council]] (PRC), lacked experience and was ill-prepared to rule. Doe became head of state and suspended the constitution, but promised a return to civilian rule by 1985.\n<!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:Samuel K.

According to the autobiography of Tolbert's wife Victoria, the First Lady witnessed a masked man with a \"white\" hand stabbing her late husband.<ref>[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1886158126/ref=olp_product_details?ie=UTF8&me=&seller= Victoria Tolbert, Lifted Up] Macalester Park Publishing Company |(retrieved 2010-10-12)</ref>\n\n== Presidency ==\nDuring his rule, Doe portrayed himself as an enlightened leader whose actions were intended to bring \"relief to many\".  He styled himself \"Dr. Doe\" starting in 1982, after making a state visit to [[Chun Doo-hwan]] in South Korea and being awarded an honorary doctorate from the [[University of Seoul]].<ref name=\"1984 birthday\" />  After seven years of calling himself a doctor, Doe announced in 1989 that he had completed a bachelor's degree from the [[University of Liberia]].<ref>\"Congrats Mr. President!\" ''Monrovia Tribune'', 1989-05: 1/12.</ref>\n\n=== Relations with the United States ===\n[[File:Secretary of Defense Caspar W. Weinberger - Samuel K. Doe.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Doe with then Secretary of Defense of the United States [[Caspar W. Weinberger]] outside the [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]] in 1982]]\nDuring his first years in office, Doe openly supported U.S. [[Cold War]] foreign policy in Africa during the 1980s, severing diplomatic relations between Liberia and the [[Soviet Union]].\n\nThe United States valued Liberia as an important ally during the Cold War, as it helped to contain the spread of Soviet influence in Africa.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} As part of the expanding relationship, Doe agreed to a modification of the mutual defense pact granting staging rights on 24-hour notice at Liberia's sea and airports for the [[United States Rapid Deployment Forces|U.S. Rapid Deployment Forces]], which were established to respond swiftly to security threats around the world.\n\n=== New constitution and 1985 elections ===\nA draft constitution providing for a multi-party republic was issued in 1983 and approved by referendum in 1984. On July 26, 1984, Doe was elected President of the Interim National Assembly.<ref>Europa World Year Book 1985</ref> He had a new constitution approved by [[1984 Liberian constitutional referendum|referendum]] in 1984 and went on to stage a [[1985 Liberian general election|presidential election]] on October 15, 1985.  According to official figures, Doe won 51% of the vote\u2014just enough to avoid a runoff.<ref>Moran, Mary H. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=7sAa75hpdiMC Liberia: The Violence of Democracy]''. 1st paperback ed.

However, most of the elected opposition candidates refused to take their seats.\n\nThe election was heavily rigged; Doe had the ballots taken to a secret location and 50 of his own handpicked staff counted them. Foreign observers declared the elections fraudulent and suggested that runner-up [[Jackson Doe]] of the [[Liberian Action Party]] had actually won.<ref>Gifford, Paul. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=GFZ_TIc4q6UC Christianity and Politics in Doe's Liberia]''. [[Cambridge]]: [[Cambridge University Press]], 1993, 22.</ref> Also, prior to the election he had more than 50 of his political opponents murdered. It is also alleged that he changed his official birth date from 1951 to 1950 in order to meet the new constitution's requirement that the president be at least 35 years old. Doe was formally sworn in on January 6, 1986.\n\n=== Increased repression ===\n\nGen. [[Thomas Quiwonkpa]], who had been a leader of the 1980 coup along with Doe, attempted to seize power on November 12, 1985; the attempt failed after fighting in [[Monrovia]] in which Quiwonkpa was killed. Doe also announced in a radio and television broadcast in this West African nation that anyone found on the streets after a 6 p.m. curfew will be considered a rebel and executed immediately.<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/13/world/liberia-says-it-foiled-coup-attempt.html</ref><ref>https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1985-11-16-mn-2771-story.html</ref>\n\nDoe's corrupt and totalitarian government became even more repressive after the attempted coup, shutting down newspapers and banning political activity. The government's mistreatment of certain ethnic groups, particularly the [[Gio people|Gio]] (or Dan) and the [[Mano people|Mano]] in the north (Quiwonkpa was an ethnic Gio), resulted in divisions and violence among indigenous populations who until then had coexisted relatively peacefully.\n\n== Murder ==\n[[Charles Taylor (Liberian politician)|Charles Taylor]], a former ally of Doe, crossed into Liberia from [[Ivory Coast]] on December 24, 1989, to wage a [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla war]] against Doe. Taylor had broken out of a jail in the United States, where he was awaiting extradition to Liberia on charges of embezzlement. The conflict quickly flared into [[First Liberian Civil War|full-fledged civil war]].  By mid-1990, most of Liberia was controlled by rebel factions.\n\nDoe was captured in [[Monrovia]] on September 9, 1990, by [[Prince Johnson|Prince Y. Johnson]], leader of [[Independent National Patriotic Front of Liberia|INPFL]], a breakaway faction of Taylor's [[National Patriotic Front of Liberia|NPFL]]. [[Arnold Quainoo|General Quinoo]], the head of [[ECOMOG]], had invited Doe to the ECOMOG headquarters for a meeting and assured him of his safety from the rebels. On the morning of September 9, 1990, Doe arrived at a precarious time during an ongoing change in guard duty from the well-armed and better equipped Nigerian team of peacekeepers to the weaker Gambian contingent. The Nigerian team had just withdrawn from the scene when Doe's convoy of lightly armed personnel arrived, none of whom were anticipating any trouble. Doe was escorted to General Quinoo's office where he was formally welcomed, while most of his team of aides and guards waited outside. Johnson's rebels surprised everyone by suddenly arriving on the scene uninvited and heavily armed, overwhelming and disarming the entirety of Doe's team while encountering no resistance. They then started shooting Doe's team individually and later in groups. Upon hearing the gunshots from outside, Doe expressed concern to Quinoo, who assured him that all was fine. Quinoo later excused himself to check on what was happening outside and was followed by his aide, Captain Coker of the [[Gambia]]n contingent. Both men took cover upon assessing the situation. Johnson's men moved indoors, finished off Doe's remaining team, shot him in the leg, and took him captive. When the dust settled, over 80 of Doe's men lay dead. Coker characterized the incident not as a fight, but a brutal massacre. Remarkably, none of the ECOMOG personnel were shot in the carnage.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}} Doe was taken to Johnson's military base and [[torture]]d before being killed and exposed naked in the streets of Monrovia where they spilled dirty water on his head<ref>https://twitter.com/NzekweGerald/status/1086901261197328384</ref>.

In 1919, the [[Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea|provisional government]] in exile during the [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese occupation]] declared the name of Korea as the Republic of Korea, ''Daehan Minguk'', also in reference to the Three Kingdoms of Korea.<ref name=\"kyunghyang\" /><ref name=\"chosun\" />\n\n== Three Hans ==\n:''Main articles: [[Byeonhan confederacy]], [[Jinhan confederacy]], [[Mahan confederacy]]''\n{{History of Korea}}\n\nThe Samhan are generally considered loose confederations of walled-town states. Each appears to have had a ruling elite, whose power was a mix of politics and [[shamanism]]. Although each state appears to have had its own ruler, there is no evidence of [[Order of succession|systematic succession]].\n\nThe name of the poorly understood [[Jin (Korean history)|Jin state]] continued to be used in the name of the Jinhan confederacy and in the name \"Byeonjin,\" an alternate term for Byeonhan. In addition, for some time the leader of Mahan continued to call himself the King of Jin, asserting nominal overlordship over all of the Samhan confederations.\n\n[[Mahan confederacy|Mahan]] was the largest and earliest developed of the three confederacies. It consisted of 54 minor statelets, one of which conquered or absorbed the others and became the center of the [[Baekje]] Kingdom. Mahan is usually considered to have been located in the southwest of the Korean peninsula, covering [[Jeolla]], [[Chungcheong]], and portions of [[Gyeonggi]].\n\n[[Jinhan confederacy|Jinhan]] consisted of 12 statelets, one of which conquered or absorbed the others and became the center of the [[Silla]] Kingdom. It is usually considered to have been located to the east of the Nakdong River valley.\n\n[[Byeonhan confederacy|Byeonhan]] consisted of 12 statelets, which later gave rise to the [[Gaya confederacy]], subsequently annexed by [[Silla]]. It is usually considered to have been located in the south and west of the [[Nakdong River]] valley.\n\n== Geography ==\nThe exact locations occupied by the different Samhan confederations are disputed. It is also quite likely that their boundaries changed over time. ''[[Samguk Sagi]]'' indicates that Mahan was located in the northern region later occupied by [[Goguryeo]], Jinhan in the region later occupied by [[Silla]], and Byeonhan in the southwestern region later occupied by [[Baekje]]. However, the earlier Chinese ''[[San guo zhi]]'' places Mahan in the southwest, Jinhan in the southeast, and Byeonhan between them.\n\nVillages were usually constructed deep in high mountain valleys, where they were relatively secure from attack. Mountain fortresses were also often constructed as places of refuge during war. The minor states which made up the federations are usually considered to have covered about as much land as a modern-day [[Myeon (administrative division)|myeon]], or township.\n\nBased on historical and archeological records, river and sea routes appear to have been the primary means of long-distance transportation and trade (Yi, 2001, p.&nbsp;246). It is thus not surprising that Jinhan and Byeonhan, with their coastal and river locations, became particularly prominent in international trade during this time.\n\n== Languages ==\nOne of the most prominent leader of the Han ([[Korean language|Korean]]: \ud55c; \u97d3) Immigration was [[King Jun of Gojoseon]] from the northern Korea, having lost the throne to [[Wiman of Gojoseon|Wiman]], fled to the state of [[Jin (Korean state)|Jin]] in southern Korea around 194 - 180 BC.<ref>Gina Lee Barnes,\u300aState Formation in Korea: Historical and Archaeological Perspectives\u300b, Psychology Press, 2001, {{ISBN|0700713239}}, p.29-33</ref> He and his followers established [[Mahan confederacy|Mahan]] which was one of the Samhan (\"Three Hans\"), along with [[Byeonhan]] and [[Jinhan]]. Further Han(\u97d3) migration followed the fall of Gojoseon and establishment of the Chinese commanderies in 108 BC.\n\nThe [[Han languages|Samhan languages]] ([[Korean language|Korean]]: \uc0bc\ud55c\uc5b4; \u4e09\u97d3\u8a9e) were a branch of the ancient [[Koreanic languages]],<ref name=\"Indiana\"> 2014.

It is generally accepted as including [[Sillan language|Sillan]], and may also have included [[Baekje language]].\n\n== Technology ==\nThe Samhan saw the systematic introduction of [[iron]] into the southern Korean peninsula. This was taken up with particular intensity by the [[Byeonhan confederacy|Byeonhan]] states of the [[Nakdong River]] valley, which manufactured and exported iron armor and weapons throughout Northeast Asia.\n\nThe introduction of iron technology also facilitated growth in agriculture, as iron tools made the clearing and cultivation of land much easier. It appears that at this time the modern-day [[Jeolla]] area emerged as a center of [[rice]] production (Kim, 1974).\n\n== Relations ==\nUntil the rise of [[Goguryeo]], the external relations of Samhan were largely limited to the Chinese commanderies located in the former territory of [[Gojoseon]]. The longest standing of these, the [[Lelang commandery]], appear to have maintained separate diplomatic relations with each individual state rather than with the heads of the confederacies as such.\n\nIn the beginning, the relationship was a political trading system in which \"tribute\" was exchanged for titles or prestige gifts. Official [[seal (device)|seals]] identified each tribal leader's authority to trade with the commandery.  However, after the fall of the [[Cao Wei|Kingdom of Wei]] in the 3rd century, ''[[San guo zhi]]'' reports that the Lelang commandery handed out official seals freely to local commoners, no longer symbolizing political authority (Yi, 2001, p.&nbsp;245).\n\nThe Chinese commanderies also supplied luxury goods and consumed local products.  Later [[Han dynasty]] coins and beads are found throughout the Korean peninsula. These were exchanged for local iron or raw [[silk]]. After the 2nd century CE, as Chinese influence waned, iron ingots came into use as [[currency]] for the trade based around Jinhan and Byeonhan.\n\nTrade relations also existed with the emergent states of [[Japan]] at this time, most commonly involving the exchange of ornamental Japanese bronzeware for Korean iron. These trade relations shifted in the 3rd century, when the [[Yamato (people)|Yamatai]] federation of [[Ky\u016bsh\u016b]] gained monopolistic control over Japanese trade with Byeonhan.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[List of Korea-related topics]]\n*[[History of Korea]]\n*[[Names of Korea]]\n*[[Han languages]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n*Kim, J.-B.

By the 4th century, Mahan was fully absorbed into the [[Baekje]] kingdom, Jinhan into the [[Silla]] kingdom, and Byeonhan into the [[Gaya confederacy]], which was later annexed by Silla.\n\nBeginning in the 7th century, the name \"Samhan\" became synonymous with the Three Kingdoms of Korea. The \"Han\" in the names of the [[Korean Empire]], ''Daehan Jeguk'', and the [[Republic of Korea]] (South Korea), ''Daehan Minguk'' or ''Hanguk'', are named in reference to the Three Kingdoms of Korea, not the ancient confederacies in the southern Korean Peninsula.<ref name=\"kyunghyang\" /><ref name=\"chosun\">{{cite web |last1=\uc774\ub355\uc77c |title=[\uc774\ub355\uc77c \uc0ac\ub791] \ub300~\ud55c\ubbfc\uad6d |url=http://news.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2008/08/14/2008081401512.html |website=\uc870\uc120\ub2f7\ucef4 |publisher=Chosun Ilbo |accessdate=2 July 2018 |language=ko}}</ref>\n\n== Etymology ==\n\"Samhan\" became a name for the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea]] beginning in the 7th century.<ref name=\"kyunghyang\" />\n\nAccording to the ''[[Samguk sagi]]'' and ''[[Samguk yusa]]'', [[Silla]] implemented a national policy, \"Samhan Unification\" ({{Korean|\uc0bc\ud55c\uc77c\ud1b5|\u4e09\u97d3\u4e00\u7d71|labels=no}}), to integrate [[Baekje]] and [[Goguryeo]] refugees.

In 1919, the [[Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea|provisional government]] in exile during the [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese occupation]] declared the name of Korea as the Republic of Korea, ''Daehan Minguk'', also in reference to the Three Kingdoms of Korea.<ref name=\"kyunghyang\" /><ref name=\"chosun\" />\n\n== Three Hans ==\n:''Main articles: [[Byeonhan confederacy]], [[Jinhan confederacy]], [[Mahan confederacy]]''\n{{History of Korea}}\n\nThe Samhan are generally considered loose confederations of walled-town states. Each appears to have had a ruling elite, whose power was a mix of politics and [[shamanism]]. Although each state appears to have had its own ruler, there is no evidence of [[Order of succession|systematic succession]].\n\nThe name of the poorly understood [[Jin (Korean history)|Jin state]] continued to be used in the name of the Jinhan confederacy and in the name \"Byeonjin,\" an alternate term for Byeonhan. In addition, for some time the leader of Mahan continued to call himself the King of Jin, asserting nominal overlordship over all of the Samhan confederations.\n\n[[Mahan confederacy|Mahan]] was the largest and earliest developed of the three confederacies. It consisted of 54 minor statelets, one of which conquered or absorbed the others and became the center of the [[Baekje]] Kingdom. Mahan is usually considered to have been located in the southwest of the Korean peninsula, covering [[Jeolla]], [[Chungcheong]], and portions of [[Gyeonggi]].\n\n[[Jinhan confederacy|Jinhan]] consisted of 12 statelets, one of which conquered or absorbed the others and became the center of the [[Silla]] Kingdom. It is usually considered to have been located to the east of the Nakdong River valley.\n\n[[Byeonhan confederacy|Byeonhan]] consisted of 12 statelets, which later gave rise to the [[Gaya confederacy]], subsequently annexed by [[Silla]]. It is usually considered to have been located in the south and west of the [[Nakdong River]] valley.\n\n== Geography ==\nThe exact locations occupied by the different Samhan confederations are disputed. It is also quite likely that their boundaries changed over time. ''[[Samguk Sagi]]'' indicates that Mahan was located in the northern region later occupied by [[Goguryeo]], Jinhan in the region later occupied by [[Silla]], and Byeonhan in the southwestern region later occupied by [[Baekje]]. However, the earlier Chinese ''[[San guo zhi]]'' places Mahan in the southwest, Jinhan in the southeast, and Byeonhan between them.\n\nVillages were usually constructed deep in high mountain valleys, where they were relatively secure from attack. Mountain fortresses were also often constructed as places of refuge during war. The minor states which made up the federations are usually considered to have covered about as much land as a modern-day [[Myeon (administrative division)|myeon]], or township.\n\nBased on historical and archeological records, river and sea routes appear to have been the primary means of long-distance transportation and trade (Yi, 2001, p.&nbsp;246). It is thus not surprising that Jinhan and Byeonhan, with their coastal and river locations, became particularly prominent in international trade during this time.\n\n== Languages ==\nOne of the most prominent leader of the Han ([[Korean language|Korean]]: \ud55c; \u97d3) Immigration was [[King Jun of Gojoseon]] from the northern Korea, having lost the throne to [[Wiman of Gojoseon|Wiman]], fled to the state of [[Jin (Korean state)|Jin]] in southern Korea around 194 - 180 BC.<ref>Gina Lee Barnes,\u300aState Formation in Korea: Historical and Archaeological Perspectives\u300b, Psychology Press, 2001, {{ISBN|0700713239}}, p.29-33</ref> He and his followers established [[Mahan confederacy|Mahan]] which was one of the Samhan (\"Three Hans\"), along with [[Byeonhan]] and [[Jinhan]]. Further Han(\u97d3) migration followed the fall of Gojoseon and establishment of the Chinese commanderies in 108 BC.\n\nThe [[Han languages|Samhan languages]] ([[Korean language|Korean]]: \uc0bc\ud55c\uc5b4; \u4e09\u97d3\u8a9e) were a branch of the ancient [[Koreanic languages]],<ref name=\"Indiana\"> 2014.

It is generally accepted as including [[Sillan language|Sillan]], and may also have included [[Baekje language]].\n\n== Technology ==\nThe Samhan saw the systematic introduction of [[iron]] into the southern Korean peninsula. This was taken up with particular intensity by the [[Byeonhan confederacy|Byeonhan]] states of the [[Nakdong River]] valley, which manufactured and exported iron armor and weapons throughout Northeast Asia.\n\nThe introduction of iron technology also facilitated growth in agriculture, as iron tools made the clearing and cultivation of land much easier. It appears that at this time the modern-day [[Jeolla]] area emerged as a center of [[rice]] production (Kim, 1974).\n\n== Relations ==\nUntil the rise of [[Goguryeo]], the external relations of Samhan were largely limited to the Chinese commanderies located in the former territory of [[Gojoseon]]. The longest standing of these, the [[Lelang commandery]], appear to have maintained separate diplomatic relations with each individual state rather than with the heads of the confederacies as such.\n\nIn the beginning, the relationship was a political trading system in which \"tribute\" was exchanged for titles or prestige gifts. Official [[seal (device)|seals]] identified each tribal leader's authority to trade with the commandery.  However, after the fall of the [[Cao Wei|Kingdom of Wei]] in the 3rd century, ''[[San guo zhi]]'' reports that the Lelang commandery handed out official seals freely to local commoners, no longer symbolizing political authority (Yi, 2001, p.&nbsp;245).\n\nThe Chinese commanderies also supplied luxury goods and consumed local products.  Later [[Han dynasty]] coins and beads are found throughout the Korean peninsula. These were exchanged for local iron or raw [[silk]]. After the 2nd century CE, as Chinese influence waned, iron ingots came into use as [[currency]] for the trade based around Jinhan and Byeonhan.\n\nTrade relations also existed with the emergent states of [[Japan]] at this time, most commonly involving the exchange of ornamental Japanese bronzeware for Korean iron. These trade relations shifted in the 3rd century, when the [[Yamato (people)|Yamatai]] federation of [[Ky\u016bsh\u016b]] gained monopolistic control over Japanese trade with Byeonhan.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[List of Korea-related topics]]\n*[[History of Korea]]\n*[[Names of Korea]]\n*[[Han languages]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n*Kim, J.-B.
