In the early decades the film industry was centred on [[Shanghai]]. The first [[sound film]], ''[[Sing-Song Girl Red Peony]]'', using the [[sound-on-disc]] technology, was made in 1931.<ref name=\":0\" /> The 1930s, considered the first \"Golden Period\" of Chinese cinema, saw the advent of the Leftist cinematic movement. The dispute between [[Kuomintang|Nationalists]] and [[Communist Party of China|Communists]] was reflected in the films produced. After the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Japanese invasion of China]] and the occupation of Shanghai, the industry in the city was severely curtailed, with filmmakers moving to [[Hong Kong]], [[Chongqing]] and other places. A \"Solitary Island\" period began in Shanghai, where the filmmakers who remained worked in the foreign concessions. ''[[Princess Iron Fan (1941 film)|Princess Iron Fan]]'' (1941), the first [[Chinese animation|Chinese animated]] feature film, was released at the end of this period. It influenced wartime Japanese animation and later [[Osamu Tezuka]].<ref>{{Cite book|title = \"A Wartime Romance: Princess Iron Fan and the Chinese Connection in Early Japanese Animation,\" in On the Move: The Trans/national Animated Film in 1940s-1970s China.|last = Du|first = Daisy Yan|publisher = University of Wisconsin-Madison.|date = May 2012|isbn = |location = |pages = 15\u201360}}</ref>  After being completely engulfed by the occupation in 1941, and until the end of the war in 1945, the film industry in the city was under Japanese control.\n\nAfter the end of the war, a second golden age took place, with production in Shanghai resuming. ''[[Spring in a Small Town]]'' (1948) was named the [[Hong Kong Film Awards#Best 100 Chinese Motion Pictures|best Chinese-language film]] at the [[24th Hong Kong Film Awards]]. After the [[Chinese Revolution (1949)|communist revolution]] in 1949, domestic films that were already released and a selection of foreign films were banned in 1951, marking a tirade of [[film censorship in China]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Recent Developments in the Chinese Film Censorship System|last=Bai|first=Siying|publisher=University of International Business and Economics|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> Despite this, movie attendance increased sharply. During the [[Cultural Revolution]], the film industry was severely restricted, coming almost to a standstill from 1967 to 1972. The industry flourished following the end of the Cultural Revolution, including the \"scar dramas\" of the 1980s, such as ''[[Evening Rain]]'' (1980), ''[[Legend of Tianyun Mountain]]'' (1980) and ''[[Hibiscus Town]]'' (1986), depicting the emotional traumas left by the period. Starting in the mid to late 1980s, with films such as ''[[One and Eight]]'' (1983) and ''[[Yellow Earth]]'' (1984), the rise of the [[Cinema of China#Rise of the Fifth Generation|Fifth Generation]] brought increased popularity to Chinese cinema abroad, especially among Western arthouse audiences. Films like ''[[Red Sorghum (film)|Red Sorghum]]'' (1987), ''[[The Story of Qiu Ju]]'' (1992) and ''[[Farewell My Concubine (film)|Farewell My Concubine]]'' (1993) won major international awards. The movement partially ended after the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]]. The post-1990 period saw the rise of the Sixth Generation and post-Sixth Generation, both mostly making films outside the main Chinese film system which played mostly on the international film festival circuit.\n\nFollowing the international commercial success of films such as ''[[Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon]]'' (2000) and ''[[Hero (2002 film)|Hero]]'' (2002), the number of co-productions in Chinese-language cinema has increased and there has been a movement of Chinese-language cinema into a domain of large scale international influence. After ''[[The Dream Factory (film)|The Dream Factory]]'' (1997) demonstrated the viability of the commercial model, and with the growth of the Chinese box office in the new millennium, Chinese films have broken box office records and, as of January 2017, 5 of the top 10 [[List of highest-grossing films in China|highest-grossing films in China]] are domestic productions. ''[[Lost in Thailand]]'' (2012) was the first Chinese film to reach {{CNY|1 billion}} at the Chinese box office. ''[[Monster Hunt]]'' (2015) was the first to reach {{CNY|2 billion}}.

These films were noted for their emphasis on class struggle and external threats (i.e. Japanese aggression), as well as on their focus on common people, such as a family of silk farmers in ''Spring Silkworms'' and a prostitute in ''The Goddess''.<ref name=Geiselmann/> In part due to the success of these kinds of films, this post-1930 era is now often referred to as the first \"golden period\" of Chinese cinema.<ref name=Geiselmann/> The Leftist cinematic movement often revolved around the Western-influenced Shanghai, where filmmakers portrayed the struggling lower class of an overpopulated city.<ref>Laikwan Pang, ''Building a New China in Cinema'' (Rowman and Littlefield Productions, Oxford, 2002)</ref>\n\nThree [[production company|production companies]] dominated the market in the early to mid- 1930s: the newly formed [[Lianhua Film Company|Lianhua]] (\"United China\"),{{efn|Lianhua is also sometimes referred to in scholarly literature as the \"United Photoplay Service\"}} the older and larger Mingxing and Tianyi.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr/international/feature_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1001614559 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100802065514/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1001614559 | archivedate = 2010-08-02 | title = Timeline | accessdate = 2006-05-08 | author = Kraicer, Shelly |date= 2005-12-06| work=The Hollywood Reporter}}</ref> Both Mingxing and Lianhua leaned left (Lianhua's management perhaps more so),<ref name=Geiselmann/> while Tianyi continued to make less socially conscious fare.\n\n[[File:JinYan2.jpg|thumb|[[Jin Yan]], a Korean-born Chinese actor featured in ''[[The Big Road]]'' (1935), who gained fame during China's golden age of cinema.]]\n\nThe period also produced the first big Chinese movie stars, such as [[Hu Die]], [[Ruan Lingyu]], [[Li Lili]], [[Chen Yanyan]], [[Zhou Xuan]], [[Zhao Dan]] and [[Jin Yan]]. Other major films of the period include ''[[Love and Duty (1931 film)|Love and Duty]]'' (1931), ''[[Little Toys]]'' (1933), ''[[New Women]]'' (1934), ''[[Song of the Fishermen]]'' (1934), ''[[Plunder of Peach and Plum]]'' (1934), ''[[Crossroads (1937 film)|Crossroads]]'' (1937), and ''[[Street Angel (1937 film)|Street Angel]]'' (1937). Throughout the 1930s, the [[Kuomintang|Nationalists]] and the [[Communist Party of China|Communists]] struggled for power and control over the major studios; their influence can be seen in the films the studios produced during this period.\n\n===Japanese Occupation and World War II===\n\n[[File:ZhouXuan1.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Zhou Xuan]], an iconic Chinese singer and film actress.]]\n\nThe [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Japanese invasion of China]] in 1937, in particular the [[Battle of Shanghai]], ended this golden run in Chinese cinema. All production companies except [[Xinhua Film Company]] (\"New China\") closed shop, and many of the filmmakers fled Shanghai, relocating to [[Hong Kong]], the wartime Nationalist capital [[Chongqing]], and elsewhere. The Shanghai film industry, though severely curtailed, did not stop however, thus leading to the \"[[Solitary Island]]\" period (also known as the \"Sole Island\" or \"Orphan Island\"), with Shanghai's foreign concessions serving as an \"island\" of production in the \"sea\" of Japanese-occupied territory. It was during this period that artists and directors who remained in the city had to walk a fine line between staying true to their leftist and nationalist beliefs and Japanese pressures. Director [[Bu Wancang]]'s ''[[Mulan Joins the Army (1939 film)|Mulan Joins the Army]]'' (1939), with its story of a young Chinese peasant fighting against a foreign invasion, was a particularly good example of Shanghai's continued film-production in the midst of war.<ref name=Centennial/><ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.chinaculture.org/gb/en_artqa/2003-09/24/content_38559.htm| title = Sole Island Movies| accessdate = 2006-08-18| author = Ministry of Culture Staff| year = 2003| publisher = ChinaCulture.org| url-status = dead| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060826094341/http://www.chinaculture.org/gb/en_artqa/2003-09/24/content_38559.htm| archivedate = 2006-08-26}}</ref> This period ended when Japan declared war on the Western allies on December 7, 1941; the solitary island was finally engulfed by the sea of the Japanese occupation.

Production in Shanghai once again resumed as a new crop of studios took the place that Lianhua and Mingxing studios had occupied in the previous decade.

''The Spring River Flows East'', a three-hour-long two-parter directed by Cai Chusheng and [[Zheng Junli]], was a particularly strong success. Its depiction of the struggles of ordinary Chinese during the Second Sino-Japanese war, replete with biting social and political commentary, struck a chord with audiences of the time.\n\nMeanwhile, companies like the [[Wenhua Film Company]] (\"Culture Films\"), moved away from the leftist tradition and explored the evolution and development of other dramatic genres. Wenhua treated postwar problems in universalistic and humanistic ways, avoiding the family narrative and melodramatic formulae. Excellent examples of Wenhua's fare are its first two postwar features, ''[[Unending Emotions]]'' (1947) and ''[[Fake Bride, Phony Bridegroom]]'' (1947).<ref>Pickowicz, Paul G. \"Chinese Film-making on the Eve of the Communist Revolution\", in ''The Chinese Cinema Book'', edited by Song Hwee Lim and Julian Ward (2011).

Wenhua's romantic drama ''[[Spring in a Small Town]]'' (1948), a film by director [[Fei Mu]] shortly prior to the revolution, is often regarded by Chinese film critics as one of the most important films in the history of Chinese cinema, in 2005, Hong Kong film awards it as the best 100 years of film.<ref>{{cite web | url =http://www.hkfaa.com/news/100films.html | title = Welcome to the Hong Kong Film Awards| accessdate = 2007-04-04 | author = |year= 2004}}</ref> Ironically, it was precisely its artistic quality and apparent lack of \"political grounding\" that led to its labeling by the [[Communist Party of China|Communists]] as rightist or reactionary, and the film was quickly forgotten by those on the mainland following the [[Chinese Civil War|Communist victory]] in China in 1949.<ref>Zhang Yingjin, \"Introduction\" in ''Cinema and Urban Culture in Shanghai, 1922\u20131943'', ed.

Indeed, an acclaimed [[Springtime in a Small Town|remake]] was made in 2002 by [[Tian Zhuangzhuang]].

The most prominent filmmaker of this era was [[Xie Jin]], whose three films in particular, ''[[Woman Basketball Player No. 5]]'' (1957), ''[[The Red Detachment of Women (1961 film)|The Red Detachment of Women]]'' (1961) and ''[[Two Stage Sisters]]'' (1964), exemplify China's increased expertise at filmmaking during this time.

Almost all previous films were banned, and only a few new ones were produced, the so-called \"revolutionary [[model operas]]\". The most notable of these was a [[ballet]] version of the revolutionary opera ''[[The Red Detachment of Women (1970 film)|The Red Detachment of Women]]'', directed by Pan Wenzhan and Fu Jie in 1970. Feature film production came almost to a standstill in the early years from 1967 to 1972. Movie production revived after 1972 under the strict jurisdiction of the [[Gang of Four]] until 1976, when they were overthrown. The few films that were produced during this period, such as 1975's ''[[Breaking with Old Ideas]]'', were highly regulated in terms of plot and characterization.<ref>Zhang, Yingjin & Xiao, Zhiwei. \"Breaking with Old Ideas\" in ''Encyclopedia of Chinese Film''. Taylor & Francis (1998), p. 101. {{ISBN|0-415-15168-6}}.</ref>\n\nIn the years immediately following the Cultural Revolution, the film industry again flourished as a medium of popular entertainment. Production rose steadily, from 19 features in 1977 to 125 in 1986.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bordwell and Thompson|title=Film History: An Introduction (Third Edition)|year=2010|publisher=McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-338613-3|page=638}}</ref> Domestically produced films played to large audiences, and tickets for foreign [[film festival]]s sold quickly. The industry tried to revive crowds by making more innovative and \"exploratory\" films like their counterparts in the West.\n\nIn the 1980s the film industry fell on hard times, faced with the dual problems of competition from other forms of entertainment and concern on the part of the authorities that many of the popular thriller and [[martial art]]s films were socially unacceptable. In January 1986 the film industry was transferred from the [[Ministry of Culture (China)|Ministry of Culture]] to the newly formed [[Ministry of Radio, Cinema, and Television (China)|Ministry of Radio, Cinema, and Television]] to bring it under \"stricter control and management\" and to \"strengthen supervision over production.\"\n\nThe end of the Cultural Revolution brought the release of \"scar dramas\", which depicted the emotional traumas left by this period. The best-known of these is probably Xie Jin's ''[[Hibiscus Town]]'' (1986), although they could be seen as late as the 1990s with [[Tian Zhuangzhuang]]'s ''[[The Blue Kite]]'' (1993). In the 1980s, open criticism of certain past Communist Party policies was encouraged by [[Deng Xiaoping]] as a way to reveal the excesses of the Cultural Revolution and the earlier [[Anti-Rightist Campaign]], also helping to legitimize Deng's new policies of \"[[reform and opening up]].\" For instance, the Best Picture prize in the inaugural 1981 [[Golden Rooster Awards]] was given to two \"scar dramas\", ''[[Evening Rain]]'' ([[Wu Yonggang]], [[Wu Yigong]], 1980) and ''[[Legend of Tianyun Mountain]]'' ([[Xie Jin]], 1980).<ref>Yau, Esther. \"China After the Revolution\", in ''The Oxford history of world cinema'' edited by Geoffrey Nowell-Smith (1997). Oxford: Oxford University Press, p. 698.</ref>\n\nMany scar dramas were made by members of the Fourth Generation whose own careers or lives had suffered during the events in question, while younger, Fifth Generation directors such as Tian tended to focus on less controversial subjects of the immediate present or the distant past. Official enthusiasm for scar dramas waned by the 1990s when younger filmmakers began to confront negative aspects of the Mao era. ''The Blue Kite'', though sharing a similar subject as the earlier scar dramas, was more realistic in style, and was made only through obfuscating its real script. Shown abroad, it was banned from release in mainland China, while Tian himself was banned from making any films for nearly a decade afterward. After the [[1989 Tiananmen Square Protests]], few if any scar dramas were released domestically in mainland China.\n\n==Rise of the Fifth Generation==\n[[File:Qufu Cinema - P1060026.JPG|thumb|A movie theater in [[Qufu]], [[Shandong]]]]\nBeginning in the mid-late 1980s, the rise of the so-called Fifth Generation of Chinese filmmakers brought increased popularity of Chinese cinema abroad. Most of the filmmakers who made up the Fifth Generation had graduated from the [[Beijing Film Academy]] in 1982 and included [[Zhang Yimou]], [[Tian Zhuangzhuang]], [[Chen Kaige]], [[Zhang Junzhao]], [[Li Shaohong]], [[Wu Ziniu]] and others. These graduates constituted the first group of filmmakers to graduate since the [[Cultural Revolution]] and they soon jettisoned traditional methods of storytelling and opted for a more free and unorthodox symbolic approach.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.kinema.uwaterloo.ca/ghy-941.htm | title = The Irresistible Rise of Asian Cinema-Tian Zhuangzhuang: A Director of the 21st Century| accessdate = 2007-04-23 |date= 2002-11-19 | author=Yvonne Ng|publisher = Kinema |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070416073506/http://kinema.uwaterloo.ca/ghy-941.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-04-16}}</ref> After the so-called [[scar literature]] in fiction had paved the way for frank discussion, Zhang Junzhao's ''[[One and Eight]]'' (1983) and Chen Kaige's ''[[Yellow Earth]]'' (1984) in particular were taken to mark the beginnings of the Fifth Generation.{{efn|Notably Zhang Yimou served as cinematographer for both films.}} The most famous of the Fifth Generation directors, Chen Kaige and Zhang Yimou, went on to produce celebrated works such as ''[[King of the Children]]'' (1987), ''[[Ju Dou]]'' (1989), ''[[Raise the Red Lantern]]'' (1991)and  ''[[Farewell My Concubine (film)|Farewell My Concubine]]'' (1993), which were not only acclaimed by Chinese cinema-goers but by the Western [[art film|arthouse]] audience. [[Tian Zhuangzhuang]]'s films, though less well known by Western viewers, were well noted by directors such as [[Martin Scorsese]]. It was during this period that Chinese cinema began reaping the rewards of international attention, including the 1988 [[Golden Bear (award)|Golden Bear]] for ''[[Red Sorghum (film)|Red Sorghum]]'', the 1992 [[Golden Lion]] for ''[[The Story of Qiu Ju]]'', the 1993 [[Palme d'Or]] for ''[[Farewell My Concubine (film)|Farewell My Concubine]]'', and three [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]] nominations from the Academy Awards.<ref name=Greatfall/> All these award-winning films starred actress [[Gong Li]], who became the Fifth Generation's most recognizable star, especially to international audiences.\n\nDiverse in style and subject, the Fifth Generation directors' films ranged from [[black comedy]] ([[Huang Jianxin]]'s ''[[The Black Cannon Incident]]'', 1985) to the esoteric (Chen Kaige's ''[[Life on a String (film)|Life on a String]]'', 1991), but they share a common rejection of the socialist-realist tradition worked by earlier Chinese filmmakers in the Communist era. Other notable Fifth Generation directors include [[Wu Ziniu]], [[Hu Mei]], [[Li Shaohong]] and [[Zhou Xiaowen]]. Fifth Generation filmmakers reacted against the ideological purity of Cultural Revolution cinema. By relocating to regional studios, they began to explore the actuality of local culture in a somewhat documentarian fashion. Instead of stories depicting heroic military struggles, the films were built out of the drama of ordinary people's daily lives. They also retained political edge, but aimed at exploring issues rather than recycling approved policy. While Cultural Revolution films used character, the younger directors favored psychological depth along the lines of European cinema. They adopted complex plots, ambiguous symbolism, and evocative imagery.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bordwell and Thompson|title=Film History: An Introduction (Third Edition)|year=2010|publisher=McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-338613-3|pages=639\u2013640}}</ref> Some of their bolder works with political overtones were banned by Chinese authorities.\n\nThese films came with a creative genres of stories, new style of shooting as well, directors utilized extensive color and [[long shot]]s to present and explore history and structure of national culture. As a result of the new films being so intricate, the films were for more educated audiences than anything. The new style was profitable for some and helped filmmakers to make strides in the business. It allowed directors to get away from reality and show their artistic sense.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bordwell and Thompson|title=Film History: An Introduction (Third Edition)|year=2010|publisher=McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-338613-3|pages=638\u2013640}}</ref>\n\nThe Fourth Generation also returned to prominence. Given their label after the rise of the Fifth Generation, these were directors whose careers were stalled by the Cultural Revolution and who were professionally trained prior to 1966. [[Wu Tianming]], in particular, made outstanding contributions by helping to finance major Fifth Generation directors under the auspices of the [[Xi'an Film Studio]] (which he took over in 1983), while continuing to make films like ''[[Old Well (film)|Old Well]]'' (1986) and ''[[The King of Masks]]'' (1996).\n\nThe Fifth Generation movement ended in part after the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|1989 Tiananmen Incident]], although its major directors continued to produce notable works. Several of its filmmakers went into self-imposed exile: Wu Tianming moved to the [[United States]] (but later returned), Huang Jianxin left for [[Australia]], while many others went into television-related works.\n\n==Main Melody Dramas==\nDuring a period where socialist dramas were beginning to lose viewership, the Chinese government began to involve itself deeper into the world of popular culture and cinema by creating the official genre of the \"main melody\" (\u4e3b\u65cb\u5f8b), inspired by Hollywood's strides in musical dramas.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ma|first=Weijun|date=September 2014|title=Chinese Main Melody TV Drama: Hollywoodization and Ideological Persuasion|journal=Television & New Media|volume=15|issue=6|pages=523\u2013537|doi=10.1177/1527476412471436|issn=1527-4764}}</ref> In 1987, the Ministry of Radio, Film and Television issued a statement encouraging the making of movies which emphasizes the main melody to \"invigorate national spirit and national pride\".<ref>Rui Zhang, ''The Cinema of Feng Xiaogang: Commercialization and Censorship in Chinese Cinema after 1989''.

Owing to the lack of state funding and backing, these films were shot quickly and cheaply, using materials like [[16 mm film]] and [[digital video]] and mostly non-professional actors and actresses, producing a documentary feel, often with long takes, hand-held cameras, and ambient sound; more akin to [[Italian neorealism]] and [[cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9]] than the often lush, far more considered productions of the Fifth Generation.<ref name=Greatfall>Rose, S.

While both directors represent Chinese cinema, their profiles are quite different. The 49 year old Jia set up the [[Pingyao International Film Festival]] in 2017 and on the other hand is Zhang, a 56-year-old film school professor who spent years working on government commissions and domestic TV shows after struggling with his own projects. Despite their different profiles, they mark an important cornerstone in Chinese Cinema and are both credited with bringing Chinese movies to the international big screen. Chinese director Jia Zhangke's latest film Ash Is Purest White has been selected to compete in the official competition for the Palme d'Or of the 71st Cannes Film Festival, the highest prize awarded at the film festival. It is Jia\u2019s fifth movie, a gangster revenge drama that is his most expensive and mainstream film to date. Back in 2013, Jia won Best Screenplay Award for A Touch of Sin, following nominations for Unknown Pleasures in 2002 and 24 City in 2008. In 2014, he was a member of the official jury and the following year his film Mountains May Depart was nominated. According to entertainment website [https://variety.com/2018/film/asia/cannes-picks-asia-most-anticipated-titles-1202751347/ Variety], a record number of Chinese films were submitted this year but only Jia's romantic drama was selected to compete for the Palme d'Or. Meanwhile, Zhang will make his debut at Cannes with ''The Pluto Moment'', a slow-moving relationship drama about a team of filmmakers scouting for locations and musical talent in China\u2019s rural hinterland. The film is Zhang\u2019s highest profile production so far, as it stars actor Wang Xuebing in the leading role. The film was partly financed by iQiyi, the company behind one of China\u2019s most popular online video browsing sharing sites.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gbtimes.com/chinese-director-jia-zhangke-to-compete-at-cannes-2018|website=gbtimes.com|access-date=2019-11-12|title=Chinese director Jia Zhangke competing at Cannes 2018}}</ref>\n\n==dGeneration Independent Movement==\n\nThere is a growing number of independent post-Sixth Generation filmmakers making films with extremely low budgets and using digital equipment.

(Chen Yuanyuan 175)<ref name=\"Chen, Yuanyuan 2017, pp. 175-188\">Chen, Yuanyuan. \"Old Or New Art? Rethinking Classical Chinese Animation.\" Journal of Chinese Cinemas, vol. 11, no. 2, 2017, pp. 175-188.</ref>\n\nIn 1937, the Wan brothers decided to produce \u300a\u94c1\u6247\u516c\u4e3b\u300b'' [[Princess Iron Fan]]'', which was the first Chinese animated feature film and the fourth, after the American feature films ''[[Snow White]]'', ''[[Gulliver\u2019s Travels]]'', and ''[[The Adventure of Pinocchio]]''. It was at this time that Chinese animation as an art form had risen to prominence on the world stage. Completed in 1941, the film was released under China United Pictures and aroused a great response in Asia. Japanese animator Shigeru Tezuka once said that he gave up medicine after watching the cartoon and decided to pursue animation.\n\n=== 1950s ~ 1980s ===\nDuring this golden era, Chinese animation had developed a variety of styles, including ink animation, shadow play animation, puppet animation, and so on. Some of the most representative works are \u300a\u5927\u95f9\u5929\u5bab\u300b'' [[Uproar in Heaven]]'', \u300a\u54ea\u5412\u95f9\u6d77\u300b ''[[Nezha]]'s Rebellion in the Sea'' and\u300a\u5929\u4e66\u5947\u8c08\u300b ''Heavenly Book'', which have also won lofty praise and numerous awards in the world.\n\n=== 1980s ~ 1990s ===\nAfter Deng Xiaoping\u2019s Reform Period and the \u201copening up\u201d of China, the movies\u300a\u846b\u82a6\u5144\u5f1f\u300b ''Calabash Brothers'', \u300a\u9ed1\u732b\u8b66\u957f\u300b''Black Cat Sheriff'', \u300a\u963f\u51e1\u63d0\u300b''Avanti Story'' and other impressive animated movies were released. However, at this time, China still favored the Japanese\u2019s more unique, American and European-influenced animated works over the less-advanced domestic ones.\n\n=== 1990s ~ 2000s ===\nIn the 1990s, digital production methods replaced manual hand-drawing methods; however, even with the use of advanced technology, none of the animated works were considered to be a breakthrough film. Animated films that tried to cater to all age groups, such as Lotus Lantern and Storm Resolution, did not attract much attention. The only animated works that seemed to achieve popularity were the ones for catered for children, such as Pleasant Goat and Wolfy \u300a\u559c\u7f8a\u7f8a\u4e0e\u7070\u592a\u72fc\u300b.\n\n=== 2010s ~ Present ===\nDuring this period, the technical level of Chinese domestic animation production has been established comprehensively, and 3D animation films have become the mainstream. However, as more and more foreign films (such as ones from Japan, Europe, and the United States) are being imported into China, Chinese animated works is left in the shadows of these animated foreign films.\n\nIt is only with the release of \u300a\u897f\u6e38\u8bb0\u4e4b\u5927\u5723\u5f52\u6765\u300bJourney to the West: The Return of Monkey King in 2015, a live-action film where CGI was extensively used in its production, that Chinese animated works took back the rein. This movie was a big hit in 2015 and broke the gross record of Chinese domestic animated movies with CN\u00a5956 million at China\u2019s box office.\n\nAfter the success of Journey to the West, several other high-quality animated films were released, such as \u300a\u98ce\u96e8\u5492\u300b Wind Language Curse and \u300a\u767d\u86c7\u7f18\u8d77\u300b White Snake. Though none of these movies made headway in regards to the box office and popularity aspect, it did make filmmakers more and more interested in animated works.\n\nThis all changed with the breakthrough animated film, \u300a\u54ea\u5412\u4e4b\u9b54\u7ae5\u964d\u4e16\u300bNezha. Released in 2019, it became the second highest-grossing film of all time in China. It was with this film that Chinese animated films, as a medium, has finally broken the notion in China that domestic animated films are only for children. With Nezha (2019), Chinese animation has now come to known to a veritable source of entertainment for all ages.\n\n==New Models and the New Chinese Cinema==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Chinese national film museum painting.jpg|thumb|A painting from the [[China National Film Museum]]]] -->\n\n===Commercial Successes===\nWith China's liberalization in the late 1970s and its opening up to foreign markets, commercial considerations have made its impact in post-1980s filmmaking. Traditionally arthouse movies screened seldom make enough to break even. An example is Fifth Generation director Tian Zhuangzhuang's ''[[The Horse Thief]]'' (1986), a narrative film with minimal dialog on a [[Tibet]]an horse thief. The film, showcasing exotic landscapes, was well received by Chinese and some Western arthouse audiences, but did poorly at the box office.<ref>''Celluloid China: cinematic encounters with culture and society'', Harry H.

His ''[[Swordsmen in Double Flag Town]]'' (1991) and ''[[Sun Valley (film)|Sun Valley]]'' (1995) explore narratives set in the sparse terrain of West China near the [[Gobi Desert]]. His [[historical drama]] ''[[Red Firecracker, Green Firecracker]]'' (1994) won a myriad of prizes home and abroad.\n\nRecent cinema has seen Chinese cinematographers direct some acclaimed films. Other than Zhang Yimou, [[L\u00fc Yue]] made ''[[Mr. Zhao]]'' (1998), a [[black comedy]] film well received abroad. [[Gu Changwei]]'s [[minimalism|minimalist]] epic ''[[Peacock (2005 film)|Peacock]]'' (2005), about a quiet, ordinary Chinese family with three very different siblings in the post-[[Cultural Revolution]] era, took home the Silver Bear prize for 2005 [[Berlin International Film Festival]]. [[Hou Yong (cinematographer)|Hou Yong]] is another cinematographer who made films (''[[Jasmine Women]]'', 2004) and TV series. There are actors who straddle the dual roles of acting and directing.

Her second film ''[[Letter from an Unknown Woman (2004 film)|Letter from an Unknown Woman]]'' (2004) landed her the [[San Sebasti\u00e1n International Film Festival]] Best Director award. Another popular actress and director is [[Zhao Wei]], whose directorial debut ''[[So Young (film)|So Young]]'' (2013) was a huge box office and critical success.\n\nThe most highly regarded Chinese actor-director is undoubtedly [[Jiang Wen]], who has directed several critically acclaimed movies while following on his acting career. His directorial debut, ''[[In the Heat of the Sun]]'' (1994) was the first PRC film to win Best Picture at the [[Golden Horse Film Awards]] held in [[Taiwan]]. His other films, like ''[[Devils on the Doorstep]]'' (2000, Cannes Grand Prix) and ''[[Let the Bullets Fly]]'' (2010), were similarly well received.

Formerly viewed only by cineastes, its global appeal mounted after the international box office and critical success of [[Ang Lee]]'s period [[wuxia|martial arts]] film ''[[Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon]]'' which won [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]] in 2000. This multi-national production increased its appeal by featuring stars from all parts of the Chinese-speaking world. It provided an introduction to Chinese cinema (and especially the [[wuxia]] genre) for many and increased the popularity of many earlier Chinese films. To date ''Crouching Tiger'' remains the most commercially successful foreign-language film in U.S. history.\n\nSimilarly, in 2002, Zhang Yimou's ''[[Hero (2002 film)|Hero]]'' was another international box office success. Its cast featured famous actors from the Mainland China and Hong Kong who were also known to some extent in the West, including [[Jet Li]], [[Zhang Ziyi]], [[Maggie Cheung]] and [[Tony Leung Chiu-Wai]]. Despite criticisms by some that these two films pander somewhat to Western tastes, ''Hero'' was a phenomenal success in most of [[Asia]] and topped the U.S. box office for two weeks, making enough in the U.S. alone to cover the production costs.\n\nOther films such as ''[[Farewell My Concubine (film)|Farewell My Concubine]]'', ''[[2046 (film)|2046]]'', ''[[Suzhou River (film)|Suzhou River]]'', ''[[The Road Home (1999 film)|The Road Home]]'' and ''[[House of Flying Daggers]]'' were critically acclaimed around the world. The [[Hengdian World Studios]] can be seen as the \"Chinese Hollywood\", with a total area of up to 330 ha. and 13 shooting bases, including a 1:1 copy of the [[Forbidden City]].\n\n[[File:Jiang Qinqin from \"Chinese Movie Week\" at Opening Ceremony of the Tokyo International Film Festival 2016 (33259230440).jpg|thumb|left|[[Jiang Qinqin]] at Opening Ceremony of the [[Tokyo International Film Festival]] 2016.]]\n\nThe successes of ''Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon'' and ''Hero'' make it difficult to demarcate the boundary between \"Mainland Chinese\" cinema and a more international-based \"Chinese-language cinema\". ''Crouching Tiger'', for example, was directed by a [[Taiwan]]-born American director ([[Ang Lee]]) who works often in Hollywood. Its pan-Chinese leads include Mainland Chinese ([[Zhang Ziyi]]), Hong Kong ([[Chow Yun-Fat]]), Taiwan ([[Chang Chen]]) and [[Malaysia]]n ([[Michelle Yeoh]]) actors and actresses; the film was co-produced by an array of Chinese, American, Hong Kong, and Taiwan film companies. Likewise, Lee's Chinese-language ''[[Lust, Caution]]'' (2007) drew a crew and cast from Mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, and includes an orchestral score by French composer [[Alexandre Desplat]]. This merging of people, resources and expertise from the three regions and the broader [[East Asia]] and the world, marks the movement of Chinese-language cinema into a domain of large scale international influence. Other examples of films in this mold include ''[[The Promise (2005 film)|The Promise]]'' (2005), ''[[The Banquet (2006 film)|The Banquet]]'' (2006), ''[[Fearless (2006 film)|Fearless]]'' (2006), ''[[The Warlords]]'' (2007), ''[[Bodyguards and Assassins]]'' (2009) and ''[[Red Cliff (film)|Red Cliff]]'' (2008-9). The ease with which ethnic Chinese actresses and actors straddle the mainland and Hong Kong has significantly increased the number of co-productions in Chinese-language cinema. Many of these films also feature South Korean or Japanese actors to appeal to their East Asian neighbours. Some artistes originating from the mainland, like [[Hu Jun]], [[Zhang Ziyi]], [[Tang Wei]] and [[Zhou Xun]], obtained Hong Kong residency under the [[Quality Migrant Admission Scheme]] and have acted in many Hong Kong productions.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.asianbite.com/default.asp?Display=2473 |title=Zhou Xun Obtains Hong Kong Citizenship<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=2016-02-05

In the early decades the film industry was centred on [[Shanghai]]. The first [[sound film]], ''[[Sing-Song Girl Red Peony]]'', using the [[sound-on-disc]] technology, was made in 1931.<ref name=\":0\" /> The 1930s, considered the first \"Golden Period\" of Chinese cinema, saw the advent of the Leftist cinematic movement. The dispute between [[Kuomintang|Nationalists]] and [[Communist Party of China|Communists]] was reflected in the films produced. After the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Japanese invasion of China]] and the occupation of Shanghai, the industry in the city was severely curtailed, with filmmakers moving to [[Hong Kong]], [[Chongqing]] and other places. A \"Solitary Island\" period began in Shanghai, where the filmmakers who remained worked in the foreign concessions. ''[[Princess Iron Fan (1941 film)|Princess Iron Fan]]'' (1941), the first [[Chinese animation|Chinese animated]] feature film, was released at the end of this period. It influenced wartime Japanese animation and later [[Osamu Tezuka]].<ref>{{Cite book|title = \"A Wartime Romance: Princess Iron Fan and the Chinese Connection in Early Japanese Animation,\" in On the Move: The Trans/national Animated Film in 1940s-1970s China.|last = Du|first = Daisy Yan|publisher = University of Wisconsin-Madison.|date = May 2012|isbn = |location = |pages = 15\u201360}}</ref>  After being completely engulfed by the occupation in 1941, and until the end of the war in 1945, the film industry in the city was under Japanese control.\n\nAfter the end of the war, a second golden age took place, with production in Shanghai resuming. ''[[Spring in a Small Town]]'' (1948) was named the [[Hong Kong Film Awards#Best 100 Chinese Motion Pictures|best Chinese-language film]] at the [[24th Hong Kong Film Awards]]. After the [[Chinese Revolution (1949)|communist revolution]] in 1949, domestic films that were already released and a selection of foreign films were banned in 1951, marking a tirade of [[film censorship in China]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Recent Developments in the Chinese Film Censorship System|last=Bai|first=Siying|publisher=University of International Business and Economics|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> Despite this, movie attendance increased sharply. During the [[Cultural Revolution]], the film industry was severely restricted, coming almost to a standstill from 1967 to 1972. The industry flourished following the end of the Cultural Revolution, including the \"scar dramas\" of the 1980s, such as ''[[Evening Rain]]'' (1980), ''[[Legend of Tianyun Mountain]]'' (1980) and ''[[Hibiscus Town]]'' (1986), depicting the emotional traumas left by the period. Starting in the mid to late 1980s, with films such as ''[[One and Eight]]'' (1983) and ''[[Yellow Earth]]'' (1984), the rise of the [[Cinema of China#Rise of the Fifth Generation|Fifth Generation]] brought increased popularity to Chinese cinema abroad, especially among Western arthouse audiences. Films like ''[[Red Sorghum (film)|Red Sorghum]]'' (1987), ''[[The Story of Qiu Ju]]'' (1992) and ''[[Farewell My Concubine (film)|Farewell My Concubine]]'' (1993) won major international awards. The movement partially ended after the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]]. The post-1990 period saw the rise of the Sixth Generation and post-Sixth Generation, both mostly making films outside the main Chinese film system which played mostly on the international film festival circuit.\n\nFollowing the international commercial success of films such as ''[[Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon]]'' (2000) and ''[[Hero (2002 film)|Hero]]'' (2002), the number of co-productions in Chinese-language cinema has increased and there has been a movement of Chinese-language cinema into a domain of large scale international influence. After ''[[The Dream Factory (film)|The Dream Factory]]'' (1997) demonstrated the viability of the commercial model, and with the growth of the Chinese box office in the new millennium, Chinese films have broken box office records and, as of January 2017, 5 of the top 10 [[List of highest-grossing films in China|highest-grossing films in China]] are domestic productions. ''[[Lost in Thailand]]'' (2012) was the first Chinese film to reach {{CNY|1 billion}} at the Chinese box office. ''[[Monster Hunt]]'' (2015) was the first to reach {{CNY|2 billion}}. ''[[The Mermaid (2016 film)|The Mermaid]]'' (2016) was the first to {{CNY|3 billion}}. ''[[Wolf Warriors 2|Wolf Warrior 2]]'' (2017) beat them out to become the highest-grossing film in China.\n\nChina is the home of the largest movie & drama production complex and film studios in the world, the [[Oriental Movie Metropolis]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/qingdao-china-movie-metropolis-easts-massive-wanda-studios-943117|title=Breathtaking Photos From Inside the China Studio Luring Hollywood East|website=Hollywoodreporter.com|accessdate=27 July 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Wanda Unveils Plans for $8 Billion 'Movie Metropolis,' Reveals Details About Film Incentives|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/wanda-unveils-plans-8-billion-939003|work=The Hollywood Reporter}}</ref> and [[Hengdian World Studios]], and in 2010 it had the third largest film industry by number of feature films produced annually.

These films were noted for their emphasis on class struggle and external threats (i.e. Japanese aggression), as well as on their focus on common people, such as a family of silk farmers in ''Spring Silkworms'' and a prostitute in ''The Goddess''.<ref name=Geiselmann/> In part due to the success of these kinds of films, this post-1930 era is now often referred to as the first \"golden period\" of Chinese cinema.<ref name=Geiselmann/> The Leftist cinematic movement often revolved around the Western-influenced Shanghai, where filmmakers portrayed the struggling lower class of an overpopulated city.<ref>Laikwan Pang, ''Building a New China in Cinema'' (Rowman and Littlefield Productions, Oxford, 2002)</ref>\n\nThree [[production company|production companies]] dominated the market in the early to mid- 1930s: the newly formed [[Lianhua Film Company|Lianhua]] (\"United China\"),{{efn|Lianhua is also sometimes referred to in scholarly literature as the \"United Photoplay Service\"}} the older and larger Mingxing and Tianyi.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr/international/feature_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1001614559 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100802065514/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1001614559 | archivedate = 2010-08-02 | title = Timeline | accessdate = 2006-05-08 | author = Kraicer, Shelly |date= 2005-12-06| work=The Hollywood Reporter}}</ref> Both Mingxing and Lianhua leaned left (Lianhua's management perhaps more so),<ref name=Geiselmann/> while Tianyi continued to make less socially conscious fare.\n\n[[File:JinYan2.jpg|thumb|[[Jin Yan]], a Korean-born Chinese actor featured in ''[[The Big Road]]'' (1935), who gained fame during China's golden age of cinema.]]\n\nThe period also produced the first big Chinese movie stars, such as [[Hu Die]], [[Ruan Lingyu]], [[Li Lili]], [[Chen Yanyan]], [[Zhou Xuan]], [[Zhao Dan]] and [[Jin Yan]]. Other major films of the period include ''[[Love and Duty (1931 film)|Love and Duty]]'' (1931), ''[[Little Toys]]'' (1933), ''[[New Women]]'' (1934), ''[[Song of the Fishermen]]'' (1934), ''[[Plunder of Peach and Plum]]'' (1934), ''[[Crossroads (1937 film)|Crossroads]]'' (1937), and ''[[Street Angel (1937 film)|Street Angel]]'' (1937). Throughout the 1930s, the [[Kuomintang|Nationalists]] and the [[Communist Party of China|Communists]] struggled for power and control over the major studios; their influence can be seen in the films the studios produced during this period.\n\n===Japanese Occupation and World War II===\n\n[[File:ZhouXuan1.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Zhou Xuan]], an iconic Chinese singer and film actress.]]\n\nThe [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Japanese invasion of China]] in 1937, in particular the [[Battle of Shanghai]], ended this golden run in Chinese cinema. All production companies except [[Xinhua Film Company]] (\"New China\") closed shop, and many of the filmmakers fled Shanghai, relocating to [[Hong Kong]], the wartime Nationalist capital [[Chongqing]], and elsewhere. The Shanghai film industry, though severely curtailed, did not stop however, thus leading to the \"[[Solitary Island]]\" period (also known as the \"Sole Island\" or \"Orphan Island\"), with Shanghai's foreign concessions serving as an \"island\" of production in the \"sea\" of Japanese-occupied territory. It was during this period that artists and directors who remained in the city had to walk a fine line between staying true to their leftist and nationalist beliefs and Japanese pressures. Director [[Bu Wancang]]'s ''[[Mulan Joins the Army (1939 film)|Mulan Joins the Army]]'' (1939), with its story of a young Chinese peasant fighting against a foreign invasion, was a particularly good example of Shanghai's continued film-production in the midst of war.<ref name=Centennial/><ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.chinaculture.org/gb/en_artqa/2003-09/24/content_38559.htm| title = Sole Island Movies| accessdate = 2006-08-18| author = Ministry of Culture Staff| year = 2003| publisher = ChinaCulture.org| url-status = dead| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060826094341/http://www.chinaculture.org/gb/en_artqa/2003-09/24/content_38559.htm| archivedate = 2006-08-26}}</ref> This period ended when Japan declared war on the Western allies on December 7, 1941; the solitary island was finally engulfed by the sea of the Japanese occupation.

Its depiction of the struggles of ordinary Chinese during the Second Sino-Japanese war, replete with biting social and political commentary, struck a chord with audiences of the time.\n\nMeanwhile, companies like the [[Wenhua Film Company]] (\"Culture Films\"), moved away from the leftist tradition and explored the evolution and development of other dramatic genres. Wenhua treated postwar problems in universalistic and humanistic ways, avoiding the family narrative and melodramatic formulae. Excellent examples of Wenhua's fare are its first two postwar features, ''[[Unending Emotions]]'' (1947) and ''[[Fake Bride, Phony Bridegroom]]'' (1947).<ref>Pickowicz, Paul G. \"Chinese Film-making on the Eve of the Communist Revolution\", in ''The Chinese Cinema Book'', edited by Song Hwee Lim and Julian Ward (2011).

Almost all previous films were banned, and only a few new ones were produced, the so-called \"revolutionary [[model operas]]\". The most notable of these was a [[ballet]] version of the revolutionary opera ''[[The Red Detachment of Women (1970 film)|The Red Detachment of Women]]'', directed by Pan Wenzhan and Fu Jie in 1970. Feature film production came almost to a standstill in the early years from 1967 to 1972. Movie production revived after 1972 under the strict jurisdiction of the [[Gang of Four]] until 1976, when they were overthrown. The few films that were produced during this period, such as 1975's ''[[Breaking with Old Ideas]]'', were highly regulated in terms of plot and characterization.<ref>Zhang, Yingjin & Xiao, Zhiwei. \"Breaking with Old Ideas\" in ''Encyclopedia of Chinese Film''. Taylor & Francis (1998), p. 101. {{ISBN|0-415-15168-6}}.</ref>\n\nIn the years immediately following the Cultural Revolution, the film industry again flourished as a medium of popular entertainment. Production rose steadily, from 19 features in 1977 to 125 in 1986.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bordwell and Thompson|title=Film History: An Introduction (Third Edition)|year=2010|publisher=McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-338613-3|page=638}}</ref> Domestically produced films played to large audiences, and tickets for foreign [[film festival]]s sold quickly. The industry tried to revive crowds by making more innovative and \"exploratory\" films like their counterparts in the West.\n\nIn the 1980s the film industry fell on hard times, faced with the dual problems of competition from other forms of entertainment and concern on the part of the authorities that many of the popular thriller and [[martial art]]s films were socially unacceptable. In January 1986 the film industry was transferred from the [[Ministry of Culture (China)|Ministry of Culture]] to the newly formed [[Ministry of Radio, Cinema, and Television (China)|Ministry of Radio, Cinema, and Television]] to bring it under \"stricter control and management\" and to \"strengthen supervision over production.\"\n\nThe end of the Cultural Revolution brought the release of \"scar dramas\", which depicted the emotional traumas left by this period. The best-known of these is probably Xie Jin's ''[[Hibiscus Town]]'' (1986), although they could be seen as late as the 1990s with [[Tian Zhuangzhuang]]'s ''[[The Blue Kite]]'' (1993). In the 1980s, open criticism of certain past Communist Party policies was encouraged by [[Deng Xiaoping]] as a way to reveal the excesses of the Cultural Revolution and the earlier [[Anti-Rightist Campaign]], also helping to legitimize Deng's new policies of \"[[reform and opening up]].\" For instance, the Best Picture prize in the inaugural 1981 [[Golden Rooster Awards]] was given to two \"scar dramas\", ''[[Evening Rain]]'' ([[Wu Yonggang]], [[Wu Yigong]], 1980) and ''[[Legend of Tianyun Mountain]]'' ([[Xie Jin]], 1980).<ref>Yau, Esther. \"China After the Revolution\", in ''The Oxford history of world cinema'' edited by Geoffrey Nowell-Smith (1997). Oxford: Oxford University Press, p. 698.</ref>\n\nMany scar dramas were made by members of the Fourth Generation whose own careers or lives had suffered during the events in question, while younger, Fifth Generation directors such as Tian tended to focus on less controversial subjects of the immediate present or the distant past. Official enthusiasm for scar dramas waned by the 1990s when younger filmmakers began to confront negative aspects of the Mao era. ''The Blue Kite'', though sharing a similar subject as the earlier scar dramas, was more realistic in style, and was made only through obfuscating its real script. Shown abroad, it was banned from release in mainland China, while Tian himself was banned from making any films for nearly a decade afterward. After the [[1989 Tiananmen Square Protests]], few if any scar dramas were released domestically in mainland China.\n\n==Rise of the Fifth Generation==\n[[File:Qufu Cinema - P1060026.JPG|thumb|A movie theater in [[Qufu]], [[Shandong]]]]\nBeginning in the mid-late 1980s, the rise of the so-called Fifth Generation of Chinese filmmakers brought increased popularity of Chinese cinema abroad. Most of the filmmakers who made up the Fifth Generation had graduated from the [[Beijing Film Academy]] in 1982 and included [[Zhang Yimou]], [[Tian Zhuangzhuang]], [[Chen Kaige]], [[Zhang Junzhao]], [[Li Shaohong]], [[Wu Ziniu]] and others. These graduates constituted the first group of filmmakers to graduate since the [[Cultural Revolution]] and they soon jettisoned traditional methods of storytelling and opted for a more free and unorthodox symbolic approach.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.kinema.uwaterloo.ca/ghy-941.htm | title = The Irresistible Rise of Asian Cinema-Tian Zhuangzhuang: A Director of the 21st Century| accessdate = 2007-04-23 |date= 2002-11-19 | author=Yvonne Ng|publisher = Kinema |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070416073506/http://kinema.uwaterloo.ca/ghy-941.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-04-16}}</ref> After the so-called [[scar literature]] in fiction had paved the way for frank discussion, Zhang Junzhao's ''[[One and Eight]]'' (1983) and Chen Kaige's ''[[Yellow Earth]]'' (1984) in particular were taken to mark the beginnings of the Fifth Generation.{{efn|Notably Zhang Yimou served as cinematographer for both films.}} The most famous of the Fifth Generation directors, Chen Kaige and Zhang Yimou, went on to produce celebrated works such as ''[[King of the Children]]'' (1987), ''[[Ju Dou]]'' (1989), ''[[Raise the Red Lantern]]'' (1991)and  ''[[Farewell My Concubine (film)|Farewell My Concubine]]'' (1993), which were not only acclaimed by Chinese cinema-goers but by the Western [[art film|arthouse]] audience. [[Tian Zhuangzhuang]]'s films, though less well known by Western viewers, were well noted by directors such as [[Martin Scorsese]]. It was during this period that Chinese cinema began reaping the rewards of international attention, including the 1988 [[Golden Bear (award)|Golden Bear]] for ''[[Red Sorghum (film)|Red Sorghum]]'', the 1992 [[Golden Lion]] for ''[[The Story of Qiu Ju]]'', the 1993 [[Palme d'Or]] for ''[[Farewell My Concubine (film)|Farewell My Concubine]]'', and three [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]] nominations from the Academy Awards.<ref name=Greatfall/> All these award-winning films starred actress [[Gong Li]], who became the Fifth Generation's most recognizable star, especially to international audiences.\n\nDiverse in style and subject, the Fifth Generation directors' films ranged from [[black comedy]] ([[Huang Jianxin]]'s ''[[The Black Cannon Incident]]'', 1985) to the esoteric (Chen Kaige's ''[[Life on a String (film)|Life on a String]]'', 1991), but they share a common rejection of the socialist-realist tradition worked by earlier Chinese filmmakers in the Communist era. Other notable Fifth Generation directors include [[Wu Ziniu]], [[Hu Mei]], [[Li Shaohong]] and [[Zhou Xiaowen]]. Fifth Generation filmmakers reacted against the ideological purity of Cultural Revolution cinema. By relocating to regional studios, they began to explore the actuality of local culture in a somewhat documentarian fashion. Instead of stories depicting heroic military struggles, the films were built out of the drama of ordinary people's daily lives. They also retained political edge, but aimed at exploring issues rather than recycling approved policy. While Cultural Revolution films used character, the younger directors favored psychological depth along the lines of European cinema. They adopted complex plots, ambiguous symbolism, and evocative imagery.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bordwell and Thompson|title=Film History: An Introduction (Third Edition)|year=2010|publisher=McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-338613-3|pages=639\u2013640}}</ref> Some of their bolder works with political overtones were banned by Chinese authorities.\n\nThese films came with a creative genres of stories, new style of shooting as well, directors utilized extensive color and [[long shot]]s to present and explore history and structure of national culture. As a result of the new films being so intricate, the films were for more educated audiences than anything. The new style was profitable for some and helped filmmakers to make strides in the business. It allowed directors to get away from reality and show their artistic sense.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bordwell and Thompson|title=Film History: An Introduction (Third Edition)|year=2010|publisher=McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-338613-3|pages=638\u2013640}}</ref>\n\nThe Fourth Generation also returned to prominence. Given their label after the rise of the Fifth Generation, these were directors whose careers were stalled by the Cultural Revolution and who were professionally trained prior to 1966. [[Wu Tianming]], in particular, made outstanding contributions by helping to finance major Fifth Generation directors under the auspices of the [[Xi'an Film Studio]] (which he took over in 1983), while continuing to make films like ''[[Old Well (film)|Old Well]]'' (1986) and ''[[The King of Masks]]'' (1996).\n\nThe Fifth Generation movement ended in part after the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|1989 Tiananmen Incident]], although its major directors continued to produce notable works. Several of its filmmakers went into self-imposed exile: Wu Tianming moved to the [[United States]] (but later returned), Huang Jianxin left for [[Australia]], while many others went into television-related works.\n\n==Main Melody Dramas==\nDuring a period where socialist dramas were beginning to lose viewership, the Chinese government began to involve itself deeper into the world of popular culture and cinema by creating the official genre of the \"main melody\" (\u4e3b\u65cb\u5f8b), inspired by Hollywood's strides in musical dramas.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ma|first=Weijun|date=September 2014|title=Chinese Main Melody TV Drama: Hollywoodization and Ideological Persuasion|journal=Television & New Media|volume=15|issue=6|pages=523\u2013537|doi=10.1177/1527476412471436|issn=1527-4764}}</ref> In 1987, the Ministry of Radio, Film and Television issued a statement encouraging the making of movies which emphasizes the main melody to \"invigorate national spirit and national pride\".<ref>Rui Zhang, ''The Cinema of Feng Xiaogang: Commercialization and Censorship in Chinese Cinema after 1989''.

The title and subjects of many of these films reflect the Sixth Generation's concerns. The Sixth Generation takes an interest in marginalized individuals and the less represented fringes of society.

It featured no star of international renown and was acted mostly by non-professionals.\n\nMany Sixth Generation films have highlighted the negative attributes of China's entry into the modern [[capitalism|capitalist]] [[market economy|market]].

One young director who does not share most of the concerns of the Sixth Generation is [[Lu Chuan]] (''[[Kekexili: Mountain Patrol]]'', 2004; ''[[City of Life and Death]]'', 2010).\n\n=== Notable \u2018sixth generation\u2019 directors: Jia Zhangke and Zhang Ming ===\nIn the 2018 Cannes Film Festival, two of China's Sixth generation filmmakers, Jia Zhangke and Zhang Ming \u2013 whose grim works transformed Chinese cinema in the 1990s \u2013 showed on the French Riviera. While both directors represent Chinese cinema, their profiles are quite different. The 49 year old Jia set up the [[Pingyao International Film Festival]] in 2017 and on the other hand is Zhang, a 56-year-old film school professor who spent years working on government commissions and domestic TV shows after struggling with his own projects. Despite their different profiles, they mark an important cornerstone in Chinese Cinema and are both credited with bringing Chinese movies to the international big screen. Chinese director Jia Zhangke's latest film Ash Is Purest White has been selected to compete in the official competition for the Palme d'Or of the 71st Cannes Film Festival, the highest prize awarded at the film festival. It is Jia\u2019s fifth movie, a gangster revenge drama that is his most expensive and mainstream film to date. Back in 2013, Jia won Best Screenplay Award for A Touch of Sin, following nominations for Unknown Pleasures in 2002 and 24 City in 2008. In 2014, he was a member of the official jury and the following year his film Mountains May Depart was nominated. According to entertainment website [https://variety.com/2018/film/asia/cannes-picks-asia-most-anticipated-titles-1202751347/ Variety], a record number of Chinese films were submitted this year but only Jia's romantic drama was selected to compete for the Palme d'Or. Meanwhile, Zhang will make his debut at Cannes with ''The Pluto Moment'', a slow-moving relationship drama about a team of filmmakers scouting for locations and musical talent in China\u2019s rural hinterland. The film is Zhang\u2019s highest profile production so far, as it stars actor Wang Xuebing in the leading role. The film was partly financed by iQiyi, the company behind one of China\u2019s most popular online video browsing sharing sites.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gbtimes.com/chinese-director-jia-zhangke-to-compete-at-cannes-2018|website=gbtimes.com|access-date=2019-11-12|title=Chinese director Jia Zhangke competing at Cannes 2018}}</ref>\n\n==dGeneration Independent Movement==\n\nThere is a growing number of independent post-Sixth Generation filmmakers making films with extremely low budgets and using digital equipment.

[[Ying Liang]] and [[Jian Yi]] are two of these generation filmmakers. Ying's ''[[Taking Father Home]]'' (2005) and ''[[The Other Half (2006 Chinese film)|The Other Half]]'' (2006) are both representative of the generation trends of the feature film. [[Liu Jiayin]] made two dGeneration feature films, ''[[Oxhide]]'' (2004) and ''[[Oxhide II]]'' (2010), blurring the line between documentary and narrative film. ''Oxhide'', made by Liu when she was a film student, frames herself and her parents in their claustrophobic Beijing apartment in a narrative praised by critics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timeoutbeijing.com/features/Books__Film-Interviews__Features/28696/100-best-Chinese-Mainland-Films-the-countdown/9/30-21.html |title=100 best Chinese Mainland Films: the countdown |website=Timeoutbeijing.com |date=2014-04-04 |accessdate=2015-10-23}}</ref>\n\n==New Documentary Movement==\nTwo decades of reform and commercialization have brought dramatic social changes in mainland China, reflected not only in fiction film but in a growing documentary movement.

[[Xu Xin (filmmaker)|Xu Xin]]'s ''[[Karamay (film)|Karamay]]'' (2010), [[Zhao Liang (filmmaker)|Zhao Liang]]'s [[Behemoth (film 2015)|Behemoth]], [[Huang Weikai]]'s ''[[Disorder (2009 film)|Disorder]]'' (2009), [[Zhao Dayong]]'s ''[[Ghost Town (2009 film)|Ghost Town]]'' (2009), [[Du Haibing]]'s ''[[1428 (film)|1428]]'' (2009), [[Xu Tong]]'s ''[[Fortune Teller (2010 film)|Fortune Teller]]'' (2010) and [[Li Ning (filmmaker)|Li Ning]]\u2019s ''[[Tape (2010)|Tape]]'' (2010) were all shot in digital format. All had made their impact in the international documentary scene and the use of digital format allows for works of vaster lengths.\n\n== Chinese Animated Movies ==\n\n=== Early ~ 1950s ===\nInspired by the success of [[Disney]] animation, the self-taught pioneers [[Wan brothers]], [[Wan Laiming]] and [[Wan Guchan]], made the first Chinese [[animated short]] in the 1920s, thus inaugurating the history of Chinese animation. (Chen Yuanyuan 175)<ref name=\"Chen, Yuanyuan 2017, pp. 175-188\">Chen, Yuanyuan. \"Old Or New Art? Rethinking Classical Chinese Animation.\" Journal of Chinese Cinemas, vol. 11, no. 2, 2017, pp. 175-188.</ref>\n\nIn 1937, the Wan brothers decided to produce \u300a\u94c1\u6247\u516c\u4e3b\u300b'' [[Princess Iron Fan]]'', which was the first Chinese animated feature film and the fourth, after the American feature films ''[[Snow White]]'', ''[[Gulliver\u2019s Travels]]'', and ''[[The Adventure of Pinocchio]]''. It was at this time that Chinese animation as an art form had risen to prominence on the world stage. Completed in 1941, the film was released under China United Pictures and aroused a great response in Asia. Japanese animator Shigeru Tezuka once said that he gave up medicine after watching the cartoon and decided to pursue animation.\n\n=== 1950s ~ 1980s ===\nDuring this golden era, Chinese animation had developed a variety of styles, including ink animation, shadow play animation, puppet animation, and so on. Some of the most representative works are \u300a\u5927\u95f9\u5929\u5bab\u300b'' [[Uproar in Heaven]]'', \u300a\u54ea\u5412\u95f9\u6d77\u300b ''[[Nezha]]'s Rebellion in the Sea'' and\u300a\u5929\u4e66\u5947\u8c08\u300b ''Heavenly Book'', which have also won lofty praise and numerous awards in the world.\n\n=== 1980s ~ 1990s ===\nAfter Deng Xiaoping\u2019s Reform Period and the \u201copening up\u201d of China, the movies\u300a\u846b\u82a6\u5144\u5f1f\u300b ''Calabash Brothers'', \u300a\u9ed1\u732b\u8b66\u957f\u300b''Black Cat Sheriff'', \u300a\u963f\u51e1\u63d0\u300b''Avanti Story'' and other impressive animated movies were released. However, at this time, China still favored the Japanese\u2019s more unique, American and European-influenced animated works over the less-advanced domestic ones.\n\n=== 1990s ~ 2000s ===\nIn the 1990s, digital production methods replaced manual hand-drawing methods; however, even with the use of advanced technology, none of the animated works were considered to be a breakthrough film. Animated films that tried to cater to all age groups, such as Lotus Lantern and Storm Resolution, did not attract much attention. The only animated works that seemed to achieve popularity were the ones for catered for children, such as Pleasant Goat and Wolfy \u300a\u559c\u7f8a\u7f8a\u4e0e\u7070\u592a\u72fc\u300b.\n\n=== 2010s ~ Present ===\nDuring this period, the technical level of Chinese domestic animation production has been established comprehensively, and 3D animation films have become the mainstream. However, as more and more foreign films (such as ones from Japan, Europe, and the United States) are being imported into China, Chinese animated works is left in the shadows of these animated foreign films.\n\nIt is only with the release of \u300a\u897f\u6e38\u8bb0\u4e4b\u5927\u5723\u5f52\u6765\u300bJourney to the West: The Return of Monkey King in 2015, a live-action film where CGI was extensively used in its production, that Chinese animated works took back the rein. This movie was a big hit in 2015 and broke the gross record of Chinese domestic animated movies with CN\u00a5956 million at China\u2019s box office.\n\nAfter the success of Journey to the West, several other high-quality animated films were released, such as \u300a\u98ce\u96e8\u5492\u300b Wind Language Curse and \u300a\u767d\u86c7\u7f18\u8d77\u300b White Snake. Though none of these movies made headway in regards to the box office and popularity aspect, it did make filmmakers more and more interested in animated works.\n\nThis all changed with the breakthrough animated film, \u300a\u54ea\u5412\u4e4b\u9b54\u7ae5\u964d\u4e16\u300bNezha. Released in 2019, it became the second highest-grossing film of all time in China. It was with this film that Chinese animated films, as a medium, has finally broken the notion in China that domestic animated films are only for children. With Nezha (2019), Chinese animation has now come to known to a veritable source of entertainment for all ages.\n\n==New Models and the New Chinese Cinema==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Chinese national film museum painting.jpg|thumb|A painting from the [[China National Film Museum]]]] -->\n\n===Commercial Successes===\nWith China's liberalization in the late 1970s and its opening up to foreign markets, commercial considerations have made its impact in post-1980s filmmaking. Traditionally arthouse movies screened seldom make enough to break even. An example is Fifth Generation director Tian Zhuangzhuang's ''[[The Horse Thief]]'' (1986), a narrative film with minimal dialog on a [[Tibet]]an horse thief. The film, showcasing exotic landscapes, was well received by Chinese and some Western arthouse audiences, but did poorly at the box office.<ref>''Celluloid China: cinematic encounters with culture and society'', Harry H.

[[Gu Changwei]]'s [[minimalism|minimalist]] epic ''[[Peacock (2005 film)|Peacock]]'' (2005), about a quiet, ordinary Chinese family with three very different siblings in the post-[[Cultural Revolution]] era, took home the Silver Bear prize for 2005 [[Berlin International Film Festival]]. [[Hou Yong (cinematographer)|Hou Yong]] is another cinematographer who made films (''[[Jasmine Women]]'', 2004) and TV series. There are actors who straddle the dual roles of acting and directing. [[Xu Jinglei]], a popular Chinese actress, has made six movies to date. Her second film ''[[Letter from an Unknown Woman (2004 film)|Letter from an Unknown Woman]]'' (2004) landed her the [[San Sebasti\u00e1n International Film Festival]] Best Director award. Another popular actress and director is [[Zhao Wei]], whose directorial debut ''[[So Young (film)|So Young]]'' (2013) was a huge box office and critical success.\n\nThe most highly regarded Chinese actor-director is undoubtedly [[Jiang Wen]], who has directed several critically acclaimed movies while following on his acting career. His directorial debut, ''[[In the Heat of the Sun]]'' (1994) was the first PRC film to win Best Picture at the [[Golden Horse Film Awards]] held in [[Taiwan]]. His other films, like ''[[Devils on the Doorstep]]'' (2000, Cannes Grand Prix) and ''[[Let the Bullets Fly]]'' (2010), were similarly well received. By the early 2011, ''Let the Bullets Fly'' had become the highest grossing domestic film in China's history.<ref name=\"fba-resurrection\">{{cite web|url=http://www.filmbiz.asia/news/resurrection-takes-china-bo-record|work=Film Business Asia|title=Resurrection takes China BO record|accessdate=April 3, 2015|author=Cremin, Stephen|date=July 24, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120730010234/http://www.filmbiz.asia/news/resurrection-takes-china-bo-record|archive-date=July 30, 2012|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://ent.qq.com/a/20110216/000002.htm|title=\u300a\u8ba9\u5b50\u5f39\u98de\u300b\u7968\u623f7.3\u4ebf \u59dc\u6587\u6210\u56fd\u5185\u7b2c\u4e00\u5bfc\u6f14_\u5a31\u4e50_\u817e\u8baf\u7f51|website=Ent.qq.com|accessdate=27 July 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Chinese International Cinema and Successes Abroad===\n[[File:Jia Zhang-Ke Skipcity DCF 2005.jpg|thumb|150px|Director [[Jia Zhangke]] at the Skip City International D-Cinema Festival in Kawaguchi, Saitama, Japan, 22 July 2005]]\n\nSince the late 1980s and progressively in the 2000s, Chinese films have enjoyed considerable box office success abroad. Formerly viewed only by cineastes, its global appeal mounted after the international box office and critical success of [[Ang Lee]]'s period [[wuxia|martial arts]] film ''[[Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon]]'' which won [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]] in 2000. This multi-national production increased its appeal by featuring stars from all parts of the Chinese-speaking world. It provided an introduction to Chinese cinema (and especially the [[wuxia]] genre) for many and increased the popularity of many earlier Chinese films. To date ''Crouching Tiger'' remains the most commercially successful foreign-language film in U.S. history.\n\nSimilarly, in 2002, Zhang Yimou's ''[[Hero (2002 film)|Hero]]'' was another international box office success. Its cast featured famous actors from the Mainland China and Hong Kong who were also known to some extent in the West, including [[Jet Li]], [[Zhang Ziyi]], [[Maggie Cheung]] and [[Tony Leung Chiu-Wai]]. Despite criticisms by some that these two films pander somewhat to Western tastes, ''Hero'' was a phenomenal success in most of [[Asia]] and topped the U.S. box office for two weeks, making enough in the U.S. alone to cover the production costs.\n\nOther films such as ''[[Farewell My Concubine (film)|Farewell My Concubine]]'', ''[[2046 (film)|2046]]'', ''[[Suzhou River (film)|Suzhou River]]'', ''[[The Road Home (1999 film)|The Road Home]]'' and ''[[House of Flying Daggers]]'' were critically acclaimed around the world. The [[Hengdian World Studios]] can be seen as the \"Chinese Hollywood\", with a total area of up to 330 ha. and 13 shooting bases, including a 1:1 copy of the [[Forbidden City]].\n\n[[File:Jiang Qinqin from \"Chinese Movie Week\" at Opening Ceremony of the Tokyo International Film Festival 2016 (33259230440).jpg|thumb|left|[[Jiang Qinqin]] at Opening Ceremony of the [[Tokyo International Film Festival]] 2016.]]\n\nThe successes of ''Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon'' and ''Hero'' make it difficult to demarcate the boundary between \"Mainland Chinese\" cinema and a more international-based \"Chinese-language cinema\". ''Crouching Tiger'', for example, was directed by a [[Taiwan]]-born American director ([[Ang Lee]]) who works often in Hollywood. Its pan-Chinese leads include Mainland Chinese ([[Zhang Ziyi]]), Hong Kong ([[Chow Yun-Fat]]), Taiwan ([[Chang Chen]]) and [[Malaysia]]n ([[Michelle Yeoh]]) actors and actresses; the film was co-produced by an array of Chinese, American, Hong Kong, and Taiwan film companies. Likewise, Lee's Chinese-language ''[[Lust, Caution]]'' (2007) drew a crew and cast from Mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, and includes an orchestral score by French composer [[Alexandre Desplat]]. This merging of people, resources and expertise from the three regions and the broader [[East Asia]] and the world, marks the movement of Chinese-language cinema into a domain of large scale international influence. Other examples of films in this mold include ''[[The Promise (2005 film)|The Promise]]'' (2005), ''[[The Banquet (2006 film)|The Banquet]]'' (2006), ''[[Fearless (2006 film)|Fearless]]'' (2006), ''[[The Warlords]]'' (2007), ''[[Bodyguards and Assassins]]'' (2009) and ''[[Red Cliff (film)|Red Cliff]]'' (2008-9). The ease with which ethnic Chinese actresses and actors straddle the mainland and Hong Kong has significantly increased the number of co-productions in Chinese-language cinema. Many of these films also feature South Korean or Japanese actors to appeal to their East Asian neighbours. Some artistes originating from the mainland, like [[Hu Jun]], [[Zhang Ziyi]], [[Tang Wei]] and [[Zhou Xun]], obtained Hong Kong residency under the [[Quality Migrant Admission Scheme]] and have acted in many Hong Kong productions.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.asianbite.com/default.asp?Display=2473 |title=Zhou Xun Obtains Hong Kong Citizenship<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=2016-02-05

The group consists of founder [[Billy Gibbons]] (guitar, lead vocals), [[Dusty Hill]] (bass, vocals) and [[Frank Beard (musician)|Frank Beard]] (drums, percussion). Initially rooted in [[blues]], ZZ Top's style has evolved throughout their career, with a signature sound based on Gibbons' blues guitar style and Hill and Beard's rhythm section. Their lyrics, often embellished with [[sexual innuendo]], focus on their Texas roots and humor. Popular for their live performances, the group has staged several elaborate tours.\n \nZZ Top formed after the demise of Gibbons' previous band, [[Moving Sidewalks]]. Within a year, they signed with [[London Records]] and released ''[[ZZ Top's First Album]]'' (1971). Subsequent releases, such as their first top-ten album ''[[Tres Hombres]]'' (1973) and the singles \"[[La Grange (song)|La Grange]]\" and \"[[Tush (ZZ Top song)|Tush]]\", gained extensive radio airplay. By the mid-1970s, they had become renowned in North America for their live act, highlighted by their performances during the [[Worldwide Texas Tour]] from 1976 to 1977, which made them national stars and was a critical and commercial success.\n \nFollowing a two-year break after facing creative stagnation and exhaustion, ZZ Top reinvented themselves in the late 1970s with a new musical direction and public image. Beginning with their albums [[Deg\u00fcello]] (1979) and [[El Loco]] (1981), they experimented with instruments including [[clavinet]]s, [[saxophone]]s, and [[synthesizer]]s, while Gibbons and Hill grew long beards as part of their image. ZZ Top gained international favor with the records ''[[Eliminator (album)|Eliminator]]'' (1983) and ''[[Afterburner (ZZ Top album)|Afterburner]]'' (1985), which integrated influences from [[New wave music|new wave]], [[Punk rock|punk]], and [[dance-rock]], and established a more mainstream sound. The popularity of their [[Music video|music videos]], including those for \"[[Gimme All Your Lovin']]\", \"[[Sharp Dressed Man]]\", and \"[[Legs (song)|Legs]]\", helped propel them onto the television channel [[MTV]] and made them one of the more prominent artists in [[1980s#Popular_culture|1980s pop culture]]. Their [[Afterburner Tour]] set records for the highest-attended and highest-grossing concert tour of 1986. After additional acclaim with the release of their tenth album ''[[Recycler (album)|Recycler]]'' (1990) and the [[Recycler Tour]], their experimentation continued with the albums ''[[Antenna (ZZ Top album)|Antenna]]'' (1994), ''[[Rhythmeen]]'' (1996), ''[[XXX (ZZ Top album)|XXX]]'' (1999), and ''[[Mescalero (album)|Mescalero]]'' (2003), with mixed successes. The group most recently released ''[[La Futura]]'' (2012) and ''Goin\u2032 50'' (2019), the latter of which is a compilation album commemorating the band's 50th anniversary.\n\nZZ Top has released 15 studio albums and sold an estimated 50 million albums worldwide.<ref>{{cite news|first= Gabriel |last= Falcon |title= ZZ Top: After 50 years they've still got legs |publisher= [[CBS News]] |date= July 21, 2019 |accessdate= March 4, 2020 |url= https://www.cbsnews.com/news/zz-top-goin-50-dusty-hill-frank-beard-billy-gibbons/}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first= Peter |last= Blackstock |title= ZZ Top at 50: Billy Gibbons takes us back to the beginning |newspaper= [[Austin American-Statesman]] |date= May 15, 2019 |accessdate= May 15, 2019 |url= https://www.austin360.com/entertainmentlife/20190515/zz-top-at-50-billy-gibbons-takes-us-back-to-beginning}}</ref> They have won three [[MTV Video Music Awards]], and in 2004, they were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]].

The band had a little apartment covered with concert posters and he noticed that many performers' names used initials. Gibbons particularly noticed [[B.B. King]] and [[Z. Z. Hill|Z.Z. Hill]] and thought of combining the two into \"ZZ King\", but considered it too similar to the original name. He then figured that \"king is going at the top\" which brought him to \"ZZ Top.\"<ref>{{cite web|title= Uncle Joe Benson \u2013 The Story: ZZ Top 9-11-15 The Stor |publisher= [[SoundCloud]] |url= https://soundcloud.com/uncle-joe-benson/the-story-zz-top-9-11-15 |accessdate= September 13, 2015}}</ref>\n\nZZ Top was managed by [[Bill Ham]], a [[Waxahachie, Texas]], native who had befriended Gibbons a year earlier. They released their first single, \"Salt Lick,\"  in 1969, and the B-side contained the song \"Miller's Farm.\" Both songs credited Gibbons as the composer. Immediately after the recording of \"Salt Lick,\" Greig was replaced by bassist Billy Ethridge, a bandmate of [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]], and Mitchell was replaced by [[Frank Beard (musician)|Frank Beard]] of [[American Blues]]. Due to lack of interest from the major American record companies, ZZ Top accepted a record deal from [[London Records]], the American affiliate of the British [[Decca Records]] label. Unwilling to sign a recording contract, Ethridge quit the band and [[Dusty Hill]], Frank Beard's American Blues bandmate, became his replacement. After Hill moved from Dallas to Houston, ZZ Top signed with London in 1970. They performed their first concert together at the Knights of Columbus Hall in [[Beaumont, Texas]], on February 10, 1970.\n\nIn addition to assuming the role as the band's leader, Gibbons became the main lyricist and musical arranger. With the assistance of Ham and engineer Robin Hood Brians, ''[[ZZ Top's First Album]]'' (1971) was released and exhibited the band's humor, with \"barrelhouse\" rhythms, distorted guitars, double entendres, and innuendo. The music and songs reflected ZZ Top's blues influences. Following their debut album, the band released ''[[Rio Grande Mud]]'' (1972), which produced their first charting single, \"[[Francine (song)|Francine]]\".<ref>{{cite web|first= Matthew |last= Wilkening |title= Revisiting ZZ Top's Second Album, 'Rio Grande Mud' |website= [[Ultimate Classic Rock]] |date= April 4, 2015 |accessdate= June 5, 2019 |url= https://ultimateclassicrock.com/zz-top-rio-grande-mud-turns-40/}}</ref>\n\n===First decade and signature sound (1973\u20131982)===\n[[File:ZZ Top (1976).png|230px|thumb|right|ZZ Top performing live in 1976]]\nZZ Top released ''[[Tres Hombres]]'' in 1973. The album's sound was the result of the propulsive support provided by Hill and Beard, and Gibbons' \"growling\" guitar tone. Dan Erlewine wrote that the album \"brought ZZ Top their first Top Ten record, making them stars in the process.\" The album included the boogie-driven \"[[La Grange (song)|La Grange]]\" (written about the [[Chicken Ranch (Texas)|Chicken Ranch]], a notorious brothel in [[La Grange, Texas]], that also inspired the musical ''[[The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas]]''). On the subsequent tour, the band performed sold-out concerts in the US. ZZ Top recorded the live tracks for their 1975 album, ''[[Fandango!]]'', during this tour. ''Fandango!'', a mixture of live recordings and new studio songs, was a top-ten album; its single \"[[Tush (ZZ Top song)|Tush]]\" peaked at number 20 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. ''[[Tejas (album)|Tejas]]'', released in 1976, would be the band's final album under their contract with London Records.

The group consists of founder [[Billy Gibbons]] (guitar, lead vocals), [[Dusty Hill]] (bass, vocals) and [[Frank Beard (musician)|Frank Beard]] (drums, percussion). Initially rooted in [[blues]], ZZ Top's style has evolved throughout their career, with a signature sound based on Gibbons' blues guitar style and Hill and Beard's rhythm section. Their lyrics, often embellished with [[sexual innuendo]], focus on their Texas roots and humor. Popular for their live performances, the group has staged several elaborate tours.\n \nZZ Top formed after the demise of Gibbons' previous band, [[Moving Sidewalks]]. Within a year, they signed with [[London Records]] and released ''[[ZZ Top's First Album]]'' (1971). Subsequent releases, such as their first top-ten album ''[[Tres Hombres]]'' (1973) and the singles \"[[La Grange (song)|La Grange]]\" and \"[[Tush (ZZ Top song)|Tush]]\", gained extensive radio airplay. By the mid-1970s, they had become renowned in North America for their live act, highlighted by their performances during the [[Worldwide Texas Tour]] from 1976 to 1977, which made them national stars and was a critical and commercial success.\n \nFollowing a two-year break after facing creative stagnation and exhaustion, ZZ Top reinvented themselves in the late 1970s with a new musical direction and public image. Beginning with their albums [[Deg\u00fcello]] (1979) and [[El Loco]] (1981), they experimented with instruments including [[clavinet]]s, [[saxophone]]s, and [[synthesizer]]s, while Gibbons and Hill grew long beards as part of their image. ZZ Top gained international favor with the records ''[[Eliminator (album)|Eliminator]]'' (1983) and ''[[Afterburner (ZZ Top album)|Afterburner]]'' (1985), which integrated influences from [[New wave music|new wave]], [[Punk rock|punk]], and [[dance-rock]], and established a more mainstream sound. The popularity of their [[Music video|music videos]], including those for \"[[Gimme All Your Lovin']]\", \"[[Sharp Dressed Man]]\", and \"[[Legs (song)|Legs]]\", helped propel them onto the television channel [[MTV]] and made them one of the more prominent artists in [[1980s#Popular_culture|1980s pop culture]]. Their [[Afterburner Tour]] set records for the highest-attended and highest-grossing concert tour of 1986. After additional acclaim with the release of their tenth album ''[[Recycler (album)|Recycler]]'' (1990) and the [[Recycler Tour]], their experimentation continued with the albums ''[[Antenna (ZZ Top album)|Antenna]]'' (1994), ''[[Rhythmeen]]'' (1996), ''[[XXX (ZZ Top album)|XXX]]'' (1999), and ''[[Mescalero (album)|Mescalero]]'' (2003), with mixed successes. The group most recently released ''[[La Futura]]'' (2012) and ''Goin\u2032 50'' (2019), the latter of which is a compilation album commemorating the band's 50th anniversary.\n\nZZ Top has released 15 studio albums and sold an estimated 50 million albums worldwide.<ref>{{cite news|first= Gabriel |last= Falcon |title= ZZ Top: After 50 years they've still got legs |publisher= [[CBS News]] |date= July 21, 2019 |accessdate= March 4, 2020 |url= https://www.cbsnews.com/news/zz-top-goin-50-dusty-hill-frank-beard-billy-gibbons/}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first= Peter |last= Blackstock |title= ZZ Top at 50: Billy Gibbons takes us back to the beginning |newspaper= [[Austin American-Statesman]] |date= May 15, 2019 |accessdate= May 15, 2019 |url= https://www.austin360.com/entertainmentlife/20190515/zz-top-at-50-billy-gibbons-takes-us-back-to-beginning}}</ref> They have won three [[MTV Video Music Awards]], and in 2004, they were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]].

The band had a little apartment covered with concert posters and he noticed that many performers' names used initials. Gibbons particularly noticed [[B.B. King]] and [[Z. Z. Hill|Z.Z. Hill]] and thought of combining the two into \"ZZ King\", but considered it too similar to the original name. He then figured that \"king is going at the top\" which brought him to \"ZZ Top.\"<ref>{{cite web|title= Uncle Joe Benson \u2013 The Story: ZZ Top 9-11-15 The Stor |publisher= [[SoundCloud]] |url= https://soundcloud.com/uncle-joe-benson/the-story-zz-top-9-11-15 |accessdate= September 13, 2015}}</ref>\n\nZZ Top was managed by [[Bill Ham]], a [[Waxahachie, Texas]], native who had befriended Gibbons a year earlier. They released their first single, \"Salt Lick,\"  in 1969, and the B-side contained the song \"Miller's Farm.\" Both songs credited Gibbons as the composer. Immediately after the recording of \"Salt Lick,\" Greig was replaced by bassist Billy Ethridge, a bandmate of [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]], and Mitchell was replaced by [[Frank Beard (musician)|Frank Beard]] of [[American Blues]]. Due to lack of interest from the major American record companies, ZZ Top accepted a record deal from [[London Records]], the American affiliate of the British [[Decca Records]] label. Unwilling to sign a recording contract, Ethridge quit the band and [[Dusty Hill]], Frank Beard's American Blues bandmate, became his replacement. After Hill moved from Dallas to Houston, ZZ Top signed with London in 1970. They performed their first concert together at the Knights of Columbus Hall in [[Beaumont, Texas]], on February 10, 1970.\n\nIn addition to assuming the role as the band's leader, Gibbons became the main lyricist and musical arranger. With the assistance of Ham and engineer Robin Hood Brians, ''[[ZZ Top's First Album]]'' (1971) was released and exhibited the band's humor, with \"barrelhouse\" rhythms, distorted guitars, double entendres, and innuendo. The music and songs reflected ZZ Top's blues influences. Following their debut album, the band released ''[[Rio Grande Mud]]'' (1972), which produced their first charting single, \"[[Francine (song)|Francine]]\".<ref>{{cite web|first= Matthew |last= Wilkening |title= Revisiting ZZ Top's Second Album, 'Rio Grande Mud' |website= [[Ultimate Classic Rock]] |date= April 4, 2015 |accessdate= June 5, 2019 |url= https://ultimateclassicrock.com/zz-top-rio-grande-mud-turns-40/}}</ref>\n\n===First decade and signature sound (1973\u20131982)===\n[[File:ZZ Top (1976).png|230px|thumb|right|ZZ Top performing live in 1976]]\nZZ Top released ''[[Tres Hombres]]'' in 1973. The album's sound was the result of the propulsive support provided by Hill and Beard, and Gibbons' \"growling\" guitar tone. Dan Erlewine wrote that the album \"brought ZZ Top their first Top Ten record, making them stars in the process.\" The album included the boogie-driven \"[[La Grange (song)|La Grange]]\" (written about the [[Chicken Ranch (Texas)|Chicken Ranch]], a notorious brothel in [[La Grange, Texas]], that also inspired the musical ''[[The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas]]''). On the subsequent tour, the band performed sold-out concerts in the US. ZZ Top recorded the live tracks for their 1975 album, ''[[Fandango!]]'', during this tour. ''Fandango!'', a mixture of live recordings and new studio songs, was a top-ten album; its single \"[[Tush (ZZ Top song)|Tush]]\" peaked at number 20 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. ''[[Tejas (album)|Tejas]]'', released in 1976, would be the band's final album under their contract with London Records.
