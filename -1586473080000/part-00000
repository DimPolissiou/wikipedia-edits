The best known of these early supernatural-based works is the 3-minute short film ''[[The Haunted Castle (1896 film)|Le Manoir du Diable]]'' (1896), known in English as both ''\"[[The Haunted Castle (1897 French film)|The Haunted Castle\"]]'' or ''\"The House of the Devil\"''. The film is sometimes credited as being the first ever horror film.<ref name=truorg/> In ''The Haunted Castle'', a mischievous devil appears inside a medieval castle where he harasses the visitors. M\u00e9li\u00e8s' other popular horror film is ''[[La Caverne maudite]]'' (1898), which translates literally as \"the accursed cave\". The film, also known by its English title ''The Cave of the Demons'', tells the story of a woman stumbling over a cave that is populated by the spirits and skeletons of people who died there.<ref name=\"truorg\">{{cite web|url=http://pages.emerson.edu/organizations/fas/latent_image/issues/1990-05/horror.htm |title=The True Origin of the Horror Film |publisher=Pages.emerson.edu |accessdate=24 April 2012}}</ref> M\u00e9li\u00e8s would also make other short films that historians consider now as horror-comedies. ''[[Une nuit terrible]]'' (1896), which translates to ''A Terrible Night'', tells a story of a man who tries to get a good night's sleep but ends up wrestling a giant spider. His other film, ''[[The Bewitched Inn|L'auberge ensorcel\u00e9e]]'' (1897), or ''The Bewitched Inn'', features a story of a hotel guest being pranked and tormented by an unseen presence.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPvs7nfaFBc|title=\"L'auberge Ensorcele\" (\"The Bewitched Inn\", French silent film)|date=16 September 2012|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref> \n[[File:M\u00e9li\u00e8s, Le ch\u00e2teau hant\u00e9 (Star Film 96, 1897).jpg|thumb|200px|left|Colorized scene from [[Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s]] 1897 short film ''[[Le Manoir du diable]]'', or ''The Haunted Castle'']]\n\nIn 1897, the American photographer-turned director [[George Albert Smith]] created [[The X-Rays|''The X-Ray Fiend'']] (1897), a horror-comedy [[trick film]] that came out a mere two years after x-rays were invented. The film shows a couple of skeletons courting each other. An audience full of people unaccustomed to seeing moving skeletons on screen would have found it frightening and otherworldly.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLbC7Y3EogU|title=George Albert Smith : The X-Ray Fiend \u2013 1897|date=3 March 2015|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref> The next year, Smith created the short film ''[[Photographing a Ghost]]'' (1898), considered a precursor to the paranormal investigation subgenre. The film portrays three men attempting to photograph a ghost, only to fail time and again as the [[ghost]] eludes the men and throws chairs at them.\n\n[[File:Le Spectre rouge (1907) de Chom\u00f3n.jpg|thumb|right|180px|''[[Sat\u00e1n se divierte]]'', or ''Satan at Play'' (1907)]]\n[[Cinema of Japan|Japan]] also made early forays into the horror genre. In 1898, a Japanese film company called Konishi Honten released two horror films both written by Ejiro Hatta. These were ''[[Shinin No Sosei]]'' (Resurrection of a Corpse), and ''[[Bake Jizo]]'' (Jizo the Spook)<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.japanzine.jp/article/jz/955/jhorror-an-alternative-guide|title=J-Horror: An Alternative Guide|date=29 September 2006|magazine=[[Japanzine]]|access-date=6 December 2016}}</ref> The film ''Shinin No Sosei'' told the story of a dead man who comes back to life after having fallen from a coffin that two men were carrying. The writer Hatta played the dead man role, while the coffin-bearers were played by Konishi Honten employees. Though there are no records of the cast, crew, or plot of ''Bake Jizo'', it was likely based on the Japanese legend of [[K\u1e63itigarbha|Jizo]] statues, believed to provide safety and protection to children. In Japan, Jiz\u014d is a [[deity]] who is seen as the guardian of children, particularly children who have died before their parents. Jiz\u014d has been worshiped as the guardian of the souls of ''mizuko'', namely stillborn, miscarried, or aborted fetuses. The presence of the word bake\u2014which can be translated to \"spook,\" \"ghost,\" or \"phantom\"\u2014may imply a haunted or possessed statue.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://reelrundown.com/film-industry/The-First-13-Horror-Films-in-Recorded-History|title=The First 13 Horror Films in Recorded History|date=21 May 2018|publisher=[[ReelRundown]]|access-date=21 May 2018}}</ref>\n[[File:La_casa_hechizada_(1906)_de_Chom\u00f3n.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Segundo de Chom\u00f3n]] produced a handful of impressive [[trick film]]s, including this one; ''[[The House of Ghosts|La casa hechizada]]'', or ''The House of Ghosts'' made in 1908.]]\n\nSpanish filmmaker [[Segundo de Chom\u00f3n]] is also one of the most significant silent film directors in early filmmaking.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://filmdirtblog.blogspot.com/2015/10/the-short-spooky-films-of-segundo-de.html|title=The Short, Spooky Films of Segundo de Chom\u00f3n, \"The Spanish M\u00e9li\u00e8s\"|publisher=Film Dirt|date=2015-10-12}}</ref> He was popular for his frequent camera tricks and optical illusions, an innovation that contributed heavily to the popularity of [[trick film]]s in the period. His famous works include ''[[Sat\u00e1n se divierte]]'' (1907), which translates to ''Satan Having Fun'', or ''Satan at Play''; ''[[The House of Ghosts|La casa hechizada]]'' (1908), or ''The House of Ghosts'', considered to be one of the earliest cinematic depictions of a haunted house premise; and ''[[Le spectre rouge]]'' (1907) or ''The Red Spectre'', a collaboration film with French director [[Ferdinand Zecca]] about a demonic magician who attempts to perform his act in a mysterious grotto.\n\nThe [[Selig Polyscope Company]] in the United States produced one of the first film adaptations of a horror-based novel. In 1908, the company produced the film ''[[Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1908 film)|Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde]]'', directed by [[Otis Turner]] and starring [[Hobart Bosworth]] in the lead role. The film is, however, now considered a lost film. The story was based on [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s classic gothic novella ''[[Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde]]'', published 15 years prior, about a man who transforms his personality between two contrasting personas. (The book tells the classic story of a man with an unpredictably dual nature: usually very good, but sometimes shockingly evil as well.)\n\nGeorges M\u00e9li\u00e8s also liked adapting the [[Faust]] legend into his films. In fact, the French filmmaker produced at least six variations of the German legend of the man who made a pact with the devil. Among his notable Faust films include ''[[The Damnation of Faust (film)|Faust aux enfers]]'' (1903), known primarily for its English title ''The Damnation of Faust'', or ''Faust in Hell''. It is the filmmaker's third film adaptation of the Faust legend. In it, M\u00e9li\u00e8s took inspiration from [[Hector Berlioz]]'s Faust [[La damnation de Faust|opera]], but it pays less attention to the story and more to the special effects that represent a tour of hell. The film takes advantage of stage machinery techniques and features special effects such as pyrotechnics, substitution splices, superimpositions on black backgrounds, and dissolves.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqnpWepNtLs|title=Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s: Faust in Hell (1903)|date=25 November 2015|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref> M\u00e9li\u00e8s then made a sequel to that film called ''[[Damnation du docteur Faust]]'' (1904), released in the U.S. as ''Faust and Marguerite''. This time, the film was based on the [[Faust (opera)|opera]] by [[Charles Gounod]]. M\u00e9li\u00e8s' other devil-inspired films in this period include ''[[The Merry Frolics of Satan|Les quat'cents farces du diable]]'' (1906), known in English as ''The Merry Frolics of Satan'' or ''The 400 Tricks of the Devil'', a tale about an engineer who barters with the Devil for superhuman powers and is forced to face the consequences. M\u00e9li\u00e8s would also make other horror-based short films that aren't inspired by Faust, most notably the fantastical and unsettling ''[[The Spider and the Butterfly|Le papillon fantastique]]'' (1909), where a magician turns a butterfly woman into a spider beast.\n\n==== Trick Films ====\n[[File:The_Haunted_Curiosity_Shop_(1901).ogv|thumb|200px|left|''The Haunted Curiosity Shop'' was clearly devised purely as a showcase for Booth and Paul's bag of tricks'' and according to Michael Brooke of BFI Screenonline, \"it's an effective and engrossing experience.]]\nAs the 19th century gave way to the 20th, artists and engineers were all pushing the boundaries of film. Artists like M\u00e9li\u00e8s, first achieved fame as a magician. During the time, stage magicians entertained large crowds with illusions and magic tricks, and decked out their sets with elaborate sets, costumes, and characters. While filmmakers like the [[Auguste and Louis Lumi\u00e8re|Lumi\u00e8re brothers]] were tinkering with motion picture devices and shot documentary-like films, M\u00e9li\u00e8s, and to an extent, [[Segundo de Chom\u00f3n]] as well, were developing magic tricks on film. They created sophisticated sight gags and theatrical special effects to either entertain or scare the audience.<ref name=\"CrashCourse\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8is28gAOTc|title=Georges Melies \u2013 Master of Illusion: Crash Course Film History #4|date=4 May 2017|publisher=CrashCourse}}</ref>\n\nIn his autobiography, M\u00e9li\u00e8s recalled a day when he was capturing footage on a Paris street when his camera jammed. Frustrated, he fiddled with the hand crank, fixed the problem, and started shooting again. When he developed the film later, and played it back, he discovered a new trick. The shot started with people walking, children skipping, and a horse-drawn omnibus workers trundling up the street. Then, in the blink of an eye, everything changed. Men turned into women, children were replaced by horses, and \u2013 spookiest of all \u2013 the omnibus full of workers changed into a hearse. Because of this, M\u00e9li\u00e8s had found a way to perform actual magic with editing, to fool an audience and pull off illusions he'd never been able to do on stage. This was the birth of trick films.<ref name=\"CrashCourse\"/>\n\nMost of the early films in cinema history consist of continuous shots of short skits and or scenes from everyday life [i.e., [[The Kiss (1896 film)|''The Kiss'']] (1898) or [[L'Arriv\u00e9e d'un train en gare de La Ciotat|''Train Pulling into a Station'']] (1896).] Filmmakers doing trick films attempted to do the impossible on screen; like levitating heads, making people disappear or [[The X-Rays|turning them into skeletons]]. Trick films were silent films designed to feature innovative [[special effects]]. This style of filmmaking was developed by innovators such as Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s and Segundo de Chom\u00f3n in their first cinematic experiments. In the first years of film, especially between 1898 and 1908, the trick film was one of the world's most popular [[film genres]]. Techniques explored in these trick films included [[slow motion]] and [[fast motion]] created by varying the camera cranking speed; the editing device called the [[substitution splice]]; and various [[in-camera effect]]s, such as [[multiple exposure]].<ref>{{citation|last=Parkinson|first=David|title=100 Ideas That Changed Film|location=London|publisher=Laurence King Publishing|year=2012|page=19}} {{verify source |date=September 2019 |reason=This ref was deleted Special:Diff/902524124 by a bug in VisualEditor and later restored by a bot from the original cite located at Special:Permalink/809075346 cite #4 - verify the cite is accurate and delete this template.

Trick films convey energetic whimsy that make impossible events seem to occur on screen. Trick films are in essence films in which artists use camera techniques to create magic tricks or special effects that feel otherworldly. Other examples of trick films include 1901's ''[[The Big Swallow]]'' in which a man tries to swallow the audience, and 1901's ''[[The Haunted Curiosity Shop]]'' in which apparitions appear inside an antiques shop.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nitratediva.wordpress.com/2013/08/09/film-history-for-free-10-entertaining-early-cinema-trick-films/|title=Film History for Free: 10 Entertaining Early Cinema Trick Films|date=9 August 2013|publisher=The Nitrate Diva}}</ref>\n\n=== 1910s ===\n[[File:Charles Ogle In Frankenstein 1910.jpg|thumb|left|180px|In 1910, [[Edison Studios]] produced the [[Frankenstein (1910 film)|first motion picture adaptation]] of [[Mary Shelley]]'s ''[[Frankenstein]]''.]] \nIn 1910, [[Edison Studios]] in the United States produced the first filmed version of [[Mary Shelley]]'s 1818 classic Gothic novel ''[[Frankenstein]]'', the popular story of a scientist creating a hideous, sapient creature through a scientific experiment.

The film tells a story of a student who inadvertently makes a [[Faust|Faustian bargain]]. In the film, a student asks a stranger to turn him into a rich man. The stranger visits the student later in his dorm room and conjures up pieces of gold and a contract for him to sign. In return, the stranger is granted to take anything he wants from the room.

Wegener made a sequel to the film two years later.This time he teamed up with co-director [[Rochus Gliese]] and made ''[[The Golem and the Dancing Girl|Der Golem und die T\u00e4nzerin]]'' (1917), or ''The Golem and the Dancing Girl'' as it is known in English. It is now considered a lost film. Wegener would make a third golem film another three years later to conclude his ''Der Golem'' trilogy.\n\nIn 1919, Austrian director [[Richard Oswald]] released a German silent anthology horror film called ''[[Unheimliche Geschichten (1919 film)|Unheimliche Geschichten]]'', also known as ''Eerie Tales'' or ''Uncanny Tales''. In the film, a bookshop closes and the portraits of the [[Prostitution|Strumpet]], [[Death]], and the [[Devil]] come to life and amuse themselves by reading stories\u2014about themselves, of course, in various guises and eras. The film is split into five stories: ''The Apparition'', ''The Hand'', ''The Black Cat'' (based on the [[Edgar Allan Poe]] [[The Black Cat (short story)|short story]]), ''The Suicide Club'' (based on the [[Robert Louis Stevenson]] [[The Suicide Club (short story collection)|short story collection)]] and ''Der Spuk'' (which translates to ''The Spectre'' in English). The film is described as the \"critical link between the more conventional German mystery and detective films of the mid 1910s and the groundbreaking fantastic cinema of the early 1920s.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=Tome of Terror: Horror Films of the Silent Era|publisher=Midnight Marquee Press|year= 2016 | isbn=978-1936168-68-2}}</ref>\n\n=== 1920s ===\n====German Expressionism====\n[[File:The Cabinet of Dr Caligari Conrad Veidt.png|thumb|The premiere of ''The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari'' in February 1920 was so successful, women in the audience were said to have screamed during the famous scene in which Cesare [[Conrad Veidt]] is revealed.]]\n[[Robert Wiene]]'s 1920 ''[[The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1920 film)|Das Cabinet des Dr. Caligari]]'' (''The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari'') became a worldwide success and had a lasting impact on the film world, particularly for horror. It was not so much the story but the style that made it distinguishable from other films, \"''Dr. Caligari'''s settings, some simply painted on canvas backdrops, are weirdly distorted, with caricatures of narrow streets, misshapen walls, odd rhomboid windows, and leaning doorframes. Effects of light and shadow were rendered by painting black lines and patterns directly on the floors and walls of sets.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Horror Film: An Introduction|last=Worland|first=Rick|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|year=2007|isbn=|location=Oxford|pages=44}}</ref> Critic [[Roger Ebert]] called it arguably \"the first true horror film\", and film reviewer Danny Peary called it cinema's first [[cult film]] and a precursor to [[arthouse film]]s. Considered a classic, ''The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari'' helped draw worldwide attention to the artistic merit of German cinema and had a major influence on American films, particularly in the genres of horror and [[film noir]], introducing techniques such as the [[plot twist|twist ending]] and the unreliable narrator to the language of narrative film. Writing for the book ''1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die'', horror film critic Kim Newman called ''The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari'' \"a major early entry in the horror genre, introducing images, themes, characters, and expressions that became fundamental to the likes of Tod Browning's ''Dracula'' and James Whales' ''Frankenstein'', both from 1931\".<ref>{{Cite book|title=1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die|last=Schneider|first=Steven Jay|publisher=Octopus Books|year=2011|isbn=|pages=30\u201331}}</ref> ''The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari'' is also a leading example of what a [[German Expressionism|German Expressionist]] film looks like.\n\nIn October 1920, [[Paul Wegener]] teamed up with co-director [[Carl Boese]] to make the final Golem film entitled ''[[The Golem: How He Came into the World|Der Golem, wie er in die Welt kam]]'', known in English as ''The Golem: How He Came into the World''. The final film in the '''Der Golem trilogy''', ''The Golem: How He Came into the World'' (1920) is a prequel to ''[[The Golem (1915 film)|Der Golem]]'' from 1915. In this film, Wegener stars as the golem who frightens a young lady with whom he is infatuated. The film is the best known of the series, as it is the only film that is completely preserved. It is also a leading example of early [[German Expressionism]].\n\n[[F. W. Murnau]] arguably made the first vampire-themed movie, ''[[Nosferatu]]'' (1922). It was an unauthorized adaptation of [[Bram Stoker]]'s gothic horror novel ''[[Dracula]]''. In ''Nosferatu'', Murnau created some of cinema's most lasting and haunting imagery which famously involve shadows of the creeping Count Orlok. This helped popularized the expressionism style in filmmaking. Many expressionist works of this era emphasize a distorted reality, stimulating the human psyche and have influenced the horror film genre.\n[[File:Untitled (Cesare -Conrad Veidt- Carrying Jane -Lil Dagover- across Rooftops) LACMA M.82.287.1e.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The visual style of German Expressionist films included deliberately distorted forms and shadows as seen here in ''[[The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari]]'']]\n\nFor most of the 1920s, German filmmakers like Wegener, Murnau, and Wiene would significantly influence later productions not only in horror films but in filmmaking in general. They would become the leading innovators of the '''[[German Expressionism|German Expressionist]]''' movement. The plots and stories of the German Expressionist films often dealt with madness and insanity. [[Arthur Robison]]'s film, ''[[Schatten \u2013 Eine n\u00e4chtliche Halluzination]]'' (1923), literally ''Shadows \u2013 a Nocturnal Hallucination'', also known as ''Warning Shadows'' in English, is also one of the leading German Expressionist films. It tells the story of house guests inside a manor given visions of what might happen if the manor's host, the count played by [[Fritz Kortner]], stays jealous and the guests do not reduce their advances towards his beautiful wife. Kortner's bulging eyes and twisted features are facets of a classic Expressionist performance style, as his unnatural feelings contort his face and body into something that appears other than human.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bfi.org.uk/news-opinion/news-bfi/lists/10-great-german-expressionist-films|title=10 great German Expressionist films|date=8 June 2018|publisher=[[BFI]]}}</ref>\n\nIn 1924, German filmmaker [[Paul Leni]] made another representative German Expressionist film with ''[[Waxworks (film)|Das Wachsfigurenkabinett]]'', or ''Waxworks'' as it is commonly known. The horror film tells a story of a writer who accepts a job from a wax museum to write a series of stories on different controversial figures including [[Ivan the Terrible]] and [[Jack the Ripper]] in order to boost business. Although ''Waxworks'' is often credited as a horror film, it is an [[anthology film]] that goes through several genres including a fantasy adventure, historical film, and horror film through its various episodes. ''Waxworks'' contain many elements present in a German Expressionist movie. The film features deep shadows, moving shapes, and warped staircases. The director said of the film, \"I have tried to create sets so stylized that they evidence no idea of reality.\" ''Waxworks'' was director [[Paul Leni]]\u2019s last film in Germany before heading to Hollywood to make some of the most important horror films of the late silent era.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://filmdirtblog.blogspot.com/2016/04/waxworks-1924-paul-lenis-early-horror.html|title=Waxworks (1924): Paul Leni's Early Horror Anthology Film Is Big on Style|date=26 April 2016|publisher=[[Film Dirt]]}}</ref>\n\nAccording to ''Wisecrack'''s episode on ''How Horror Movies Changed'', \"the horror genre blossoms anywhere there was pain and national chaos. So it's more than fitting that the genre's real boom took place in the mega-depressing [[Post\u2013World War I recession|Post-World War I Germany]]. During the war (1914\u20131918), Germany banned all foreign films, inadvertently throwing all film nerds a boom. Combine that embargo with the general despair of the era, you'll see why German Expressionism took place.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KqW_ElEnLGI|title=How HORROR Movies Changed \u2013 Wisecrack Edition|date=23 February 2019|publisher=Wisecrack}}</ref> German Expressionism was a film genre that was \"all about coping with economic and social fallout via dream-like horror films, filled with subjective shots, funky angles, high-contrast spooky lighting, and frequently, sympathetic monsters.\"\n\n====Universal Classic Monsters 1920s====\n[[File:PhantomOp.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Lon Chaney, Sr.]] and [[Mary Philbin]] in the 1925 film ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1925 film)|The Phantom of the Opera]]''.]]\nThough the word ''horror'' to describe the film genre would not be used until the 1930s (when [[Universal Pictures]] began releasing their initial monster films), earlier American productions often relied on horror and gothic themes. Many of these early films were considered dark [[melodramas]] because of their stock characters and emotion-heavy plots that focused on romance, violence, suspense, and sentimentality.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=The Horror Film: An Introduction|last=Worland|first=Rick|publisher=Blackwell Publisher|year=2007|isbn=|location=Oxford|pages=}}</ref>\n\nIn 1923, [[Universal Pictures]] started producing films with horror and mostly gothic elements. This would retroactively become the first phase of the studio's [[Universal Classic Monsters]] series that would continue for three more decades. Universal Pictures' classic monsters of the 1920s featured hideously deformed characters like [[Quasimodo]], [[Erik (The Phantom of the Opera)|The Phantom]], and [[The Man Who Laughs|Gwynplaine]].\n\nThe first film of the series was ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1923 film)|The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]'' (1923) starring [[Lon Chaney]] as the hunchback [[Quasimodo]]. The film was adapted from the classic French gothic novel [[The Hunchback of Notre-Dame|of the same name]] written by [[Victor Hugo]] in 1833, about a horribly deformed bell ringer in the cathedral of Notre-Dame. The film elevated Chaney, already a well-known character actor, to full star status in Hollywood, and also helped set a standard for many later horror films.\n\nTwo years later, Chaney stars as [[Erik (The Phantom of the Opera)|The Phantom]] who haunts the Paris Opera House in 1925's silent horror film, ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1925 film)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'', based on the mystery novel by [[Gaston Leroux]] published 15 years earlier.

John MacCormac, reporting from London for [[The New York Times]] upon the film's UK premiere, wrote; ''\"The universal opinion of London critics is that ''The Terror'' is so bad that it is almost suicidal.

The story is about a scientist and his assistant who dig up corpses in the hopes to reanimated them with electricity. The experiment goes awry when Dr. Frankenstein's assistant accidentally gives the creature a murderer's abnormal brain. 1931's ''Frankenstein'' was based on a [[Peggy Webling|1927 play]] by [[Peggy Webling]] which in turn was based off [[Mary Shelley]]\u2019s classic [[Frankenstein|1818 Gothic novel]]. The film was directed by [[James Whale]] and stars [[Boris Karloff]] as Frankenstein\u2019s monster in one of his most iconic roles. A hit with both audiences and critics, the film was followed by multiple sequels and along with the same year\u2019s ''[[Dracula (1931 English-language film)|Dracula]]'', has become one of the most famous horror films in history. \u201cUniversal\u2019s makeup genius [[Jack Pierce (makeup artist)|Jack Pierce]] created the main look of the monster, devising the flattop, the neck terminals, the heavy eyelids, and the elongated scarred hands, while director James Whale outfitted the creature with a shabby suit.\u201d<ref>{{Cite book|title=1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die|last=Schneider|first= Steven Jay|year=2011|isbn=|page=88}}</ref>\n\nOn February 21, 1932, Universal Pictures released a double-feature. The first one is ''[[Murders in the Rue Morgue (1932 film)|Murders in the Rue Morgue]]''. It stars [[Bela Lugosi]] as a lunatic scientist who abducts women and injects them with blood from his ill-tempered caged ape. The film was loosely based on an [[The Murders in the Rue Morgue|1841 short story]] by [[Edgar Allan Poe]]. Universal Pictures would release two more Poe adaptations later in the decade. The second film in the double-feature is the [[James Whale]]-directed ''[[The Old Dark House (1932 film)|The Old Dark House]]''. It's a mystery horror story starring [[Boris Karloff]]. Five travelers are admitted to a large foreboding old house that belongs to an extremely strange family. The story was based on a 1927 novel by [[J.B. Priestly]].\n\nOn December 1932, the studio released ''[[The Mummy (1932 film)|The Mummy]]'' starring [[Boris Karloff]] as the Egyptian monster. The film, based on an original screenplay, is about an ancient Egyptian [[mummy]] named Imhotep who is discovered by a team of archaeologists and inadvertently brought back to life through a magic scroll. Review aggregator website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reports a 93% score, based on 27 reviews, with an average rating of 7.9/10. The site's consensus states: \"Relying more on mood and atmosphere than the thrills typical of modern horror fare, Universal's The Mummy sets a masterful template for mummy-themed films to follow.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1014370_mummy |title=The Mummy |website= Rotten Tomatoes}}</ref>  The Mummy character was so popular that it spawned sequels and remakes over the next decades.\n\nMake-up artist [[Jack Pierce (makeup artist)|Jack Pierce]] was responsible for the look of the Mummy.

Pierce began transforming Karloff at 11 a.m., applying cotton, collodion and spirit gum to his face; clay to his hair; and wrapping him in linen bandages treated with acid and burnt in an oven, finishing the job at 7 p.m. Karloff finished his scenes by 2 a.m., and another two hours were spent removing the make-up. [[Boris Karloff]] found the removal of gum from his face painful, and overall found the day \"the most trying ordeal I [had] ever endured\".<ref>{{Cite book|title=Hollywood Horror: From Gothic to Cosmic|last=Vieira|first=Mark A|publisher=New York: Harry N.

The first one was in July. It was a murder-mystery film called ''[[The Secret of the Blue Room]]''. The plot of the film is that, according to legend, the \"blue room\" inside a mansion is cursed. Everyone who has ever spent the night there has met with an untimely end. Three men wager that each can survive a night in the forbidding room.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://letterboxd.com/film/secret-of-the-blue-room/ |title=Secret of the Blue Room. 1933. Directed by Kurt Neumann. |publisher=Letterboxd }}</ref> In November, the studio premiered another iconic character with [[Griffin (The Invisible Man)|Dr. Jack Griffin]], aka the Invisible Man in the classic science fiction-horror ''[[The Invisible Man (1933 film)|The Invisible Man]]''. The film was directed by [[James Whale]] and stars [[Claude Rains]] as the titular character. The movie was based on a science fiction novel [[The Invisible Man|of the same name]] by [[H. G. Wells]] published in 1897. The film has been described as a \"nearly perfect translation of the spirit of the book\".<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Science of Fiction and the Fiction of Science: Collected Essays on SF Storytelling and the Gnostic Imagination|last=McFarland|year=2009|isbn=|page=41}}</ref> It spawned a number of sequels, plus many spinoffs using the idea of an \"invisible man\" that were largely unrelated to Wells' original story.\n\n''The Invisible Man'' is known for its clever and groundbreaking visual effects by [[John P. Fulton]], [[John J. Mescall]] and [[Frank D. Williams (cinematographer)|Frank D.

Claude Rains was claustrophobic and it was hard to breathe through the suit. Consequently, the work was especially difficult for him, and a double, who was somewhat shorter than Rains, was sometimes used.\n\nIn 1934, Universal Pictures released the successful psychological horror film ''[[The Black Cat (1934 film)|The Black Cat]]''. It stars both [[Boris Karloff]] and [[Bela Lugosi]]. It was the first of six movies Universal Pictures paired the two iconic actors together. ''The Black Cat'' became Universal Pictures' biggest box office hit of the year and is considered by many to be the one that created and popularized the psychological horror subgenre, emphasizing on atmosphere, eerie sounds, the darker side of the human psyche, and emotions like fear and guilt to deliver its scares, something that was not used in the horror genre before. Although it was credited the film was based om [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s classic 1841 [[The Black Cat (short story)|short story]], the film actually has little to do with Poe's story. In the film, \nAmerican honeymooners in Hungary become trapped in the home of a Satan-worshiping priest when the bride is taken there for medical help following a road accident.

The first picture they released in 1935 was ''[[The Mystery of Edwin Drood (1935 film)|The Mystery of Edwin Drood]]'', a mystery drama film starring [[Claude Rains]]. The story revolves around an opium-addicted choirmaster who develops an obsession for a beautiful young girl and will not stop short of murder in order to have her. The film was based on the final novel by [[Charles Dickens]] in 1870.\n\nIn April 1935, ''[[Bride of Frankenstein]]'' premiered. The science-fiction/horror film was the first sequel to the 1931 hit ''[[Frankenstein (1931 film)|Frankenstein]]''. It is widely regarded as one of the greatest sequels in cinematic history, with many fans and critics considering it to be an improvement on the original film. As with the original, ''Bride of Frankenstein'' was directed by [[James Whale]] and stars [[Boris Karloff]] as the Monster. In the film, Dr. Frankenstein, goaded by an even madder scientist, builds his monster a mate, often referred to as [[Bride of Frankenstein (character)|the Monster's Bride]]. Makeup artist [[Jack Pierce (makeup artist)|Jack Pierce]] returned to create the makeup for the Monster and his Bride. Over the course of filming, Pierce modified the Monster's makeup to indicate that the Monster's injuries were healing as the film progressed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/69663/Bride-of-Frankenstein/ |title=Bride of Frankenstein Legacy Collection edition (DVD).

The film stars [[Henry Hull]] as the titular character. In the movie, he is a botanist who gets attacked by a strange animal. The bite causes him to turn into a bloodthirsty monster. [[Jack Pierce (makeup artist)|Jack Pierce]] created the make-up for the creature. Screenwriter and journalist [[Frank Nugent]], writing for ''[[The New York Times]]'', thought the film was \"designed solely to amaze and horrify.\" He continued by writing, \"''Werewolf of London'' goes about its task with commendable thoroughness, sparing no grisly detail and springing from scene to scene with even greater ease than that oft attributed to a daring young aerialist. Granting that the central idea has been used before, the picture still rates the attention of action-and-horror enthusiasts.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1935/05/10/archives/at-the-rialto.html|title=At the Rialto.

The film was ''[[The Raven (1935 film)|The Raven]]''. The film was not actually a direct adaptation of the [[The Raven|classic 1845 poem]], but rather inspired from it. In the film, a brilliant surgeon, played by Bela Lugosi, is obsessed with the writer [[Edgar Allan Poe]]. He saves the life of a beautiful dancer but goes mad when he can't have her. Meanwhile, Boris Karloff plays a fugitive murderer on the run from the police. 1935's ''The Raven'' contains themes of torture, disfigurement, and grisly revenge. The film did not do particularly well at the box office during its initial release, and indirectly led to a temporary ban on horror films in England. At the time, it was beginning to look like the horror genre was no longer economically viable, and paired with the strict [[Motion Picture Production Code|production code]] of the era, American filmmakers struggled to make creative works on screen, and horror eventually went out of vogue. This proved a devastating development at the time for Lugosi, who found himself losing work and struggling to support his family. Universal Pictures changed ownership in 1936, and the new management was less interested in the macabre.\n\nIn 1936, Universal Pictures continued to make films for the series. In January, the studio premiered the science fiction melodrama ''[[The Invisible Ray (1936 film)|The Invisible Ray]]''. The film pairs [[Bela Lugosi]] and [[Boris Karloff]] a third time. In the film, a scientist creates a telescope-like device that captures light waves from the Andromeda Galaxy, giving him a way to view the distant past. He and several colleagues go to Africa to locate a large, unusual meteorite that the light-waves showed fell there a billion years earlier. After discovering that the meteorite is composed of a poisonous unknown element, \"Radium X\", he begins to glow in the dark, and his touch becomes deadly. These radiation effects also begin to slowly drive him mad. Critics noted the tone of the film to be somber, dignified, and tragic. ''The Invisible Ray'' is a morality play, particularly given the film's final lines of dialog, uttered nine years before the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|events of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]], by Madame Rukh: \"My son, you have broken the first law of science...Janos Rukh is dead, but part of him will go on to eternity, working for humanity\".\n\nIn May 1936, Universal Pictures released a sequel to 1931's ''Dracula''. The film was called ''[[Dracula's Daughter]]'' and stars [[Gloria Holden]] in the title role. ''Dracula's Daughter'' doesn't feature [[Bela Lugosi]] or his character, but instead tells the story of Countess Marya Zaleska, the daughter of Count Dracula and herself a vampire. Following Dracula's death, she believes that by destroying his body she will be free of his influence and live normally. When this fails, she turns to a psychiatrist, played by [[Otto Kruger]]. He, in turn, has a fianc\u00e9, Janet. The Countess kidnaps Janet and takes her to Transylvania, leading to a battle between Dr. Garth and the Countess. While not as successful as the original upon its release, the film was generally well-reviewed. In the intervening decades, criticism has been deeply divided. Contemporary critics and scholars have noted the film's strong lesbian overtones, which Universal acknowledged from the start of production and exploited in some early advertising. Universal would completed their initial ''Dracula'' trilogy seven years later with ''[[Son of Dracula (1943 film)|Son of Dracula]]''.\n[[File:GloriaHolden2DraculasDaughterTrailerScreenshot1936.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[Gloria Holden]] as the Countess in ''[[Dracula's Daughter]]'']]\n\nIn 1937, Universal Pictures only released one film in the series. The film was ''[[Night Key]]'', a science fiction crime thriller starring [[Boris Karloff]]. In ''Night Key'', Karloff plays an elderly inventor of a burglar alarm who attempts to get back at the man who stole the profits to his invention. Later, his device is then subverted by gangsters who threatens him and use his own device to facilitate burglaries. Letterboxd users call the film \"a delightfully corny, old-fashioned thriller\". and praised the film for Karloff's performance.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://letterboxd.com/film/night-key/|title= Night Key (1937) Letterboxd Reviews |publisher=Letterboxd }}</ref>\n\nIn 1938, Universal Pictures did not release any film related to horror, thriller, or science fiction. Instead, they made re-releases of their previous ''Dracula'' and ''Frankenstein'' films. It was only on January 1939, a full year and a half after the release of ''Night Key'' that the studio continued putting out original horror movies. In January 7, 1939, Universal Pictures premiered their 12-part serial ''[[The Phantom Creeps]]''. It stars [[Bela Lugosi]] as a mad scientist who attempts to rule the world by creating various elaborate inventions. In a dramatic fashion, foreign agents and [[G-Man (slang)|G-Men]] (government men) try to seize the inventions for themselves. A 78-minute feature film version of the film, cut down from the serial's original 265 minutes, was released for television ten years later. ''The Phantom Creeps'' was Universal Pictures' 112th serial and 44th to have sound. The innovation of the scrolling text version of the synopsis at the beginning of each chapter was used for the ''[[Star Wars]]'' films as the \"Star Wars opening crawl\".\n\nIn January 13, 1939, Universal Pictures released ''[[Son of Frankenstein]]'', the third entry in the studio's ''Frankenstein'' series and the last to feature [[Boris Karloff]] as the Monster. It is also the first to feature [[Bela Lugosi]] as Ygor. The film is the sequel to James Whale's ''[[Bride of Frankenstein]]'', and stars top-billed [[Basil Rathbone]], Karloff, Lugosi and [[Lionel Atwill]]. ''Son of Frankenstein'' was a reaction to the popular re-releases of ''Dracula'' and ''Frankenstein'' as double-features in 1938. In the film, one of the sons of Frankenstein finds his father's monster in a coma and revives him, only to find out he is controlled by Ygor who is bent on revenge. Universal's declining horror output was revitalized with the enormously successful ''Son of Frankenstein'', in which the studio cast both stars (Lugosi and Karloff) again for the fourth time.\n\nIn November 1939, Universal Pictures released their last horror film of the 1930s with the historical and quasi-horror film, ''[[Tower of London (1939 film)|Tower of London]]''. It stars [[Basil Rathbone]] as the future [[Richard III of England|King Richard III of England]], and [[Boris Karloff]] as his fictitious club-footed executioner Mord. [[Vincent Price]], in only his third film, appears as [[George Plantagenet, 1st Duke of Clarence|George, Duke of Clarence.]] ''Tower of London'' is based on the traditional depiction of Richard rising to become King of England in 1483 by eliminating everyone ahead of him. Each time Richard accomplishes a murder, he removes one figurine from a dollhouse resembling a throne room. Once he has completed his task, he now needs to defeat the exiled [[Henry VII of England|Henry Tudor]] to retain the throne.\n\n====Other productions====\nOther studios followed Universal's lead. [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]]'s controversial ''[[Freaks (1932 film)|Freaks]]'' (1932) frightened audiences at the time, featuring characters played by people who had real deformities,. The studio even disowned the film, and it remained banned in the United Kingdom, for 30 years.<ref>Derek Malcolm [https://www.theguardian.com/film/1999/apr/15/derekmalcolmscenturyoffilm.derekmalcolm \"Tod Browning: Freaks\"], ''The Guardian'', 15 April 1999; ''A Century of Films'', London: IB Tauris, 2000, p.66-67.</ref> [[Paramount Pictures]]' ''[[Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1931 film)|Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde]]'' (1931) is remembered for its innovative use of photographic filters to create Jekyll's transformation before the camera.<ref>David J. Skal, ''The Monster Show: a Cultural History of Horror'', New York: Faber, p.142.</ref> And [[RKO]] created the highly successful and influential monster movie, ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]'' (1933). With the progression of the genre, actors like Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi were beginning to build entire careers in horror.\n\nEarly in the decade also, Danish director [[Carl Theodor Dreyer]] created the horror fantasy film ''[[Vampyr]]'' (1932) based on elements from [[J. Sheridan Le Fanu]]'s collection of supernatural stories ''[[In a Glass Darkly]]''. The German-produced sound film tells the story of Allan Gray, a student of the occult who enters a village under the curse of a vampire. According to the book [[1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die]], ''Vampyr'''s \"greatness derives partly from Dreyer's handling of the vampire theme in terms of sexuality and eroticism, and partly from its highly distinctive, dreamy look.\"\n\n=== 1940s ===\nIn the 1940s, [[Val Lewton]] became a well known figure in early B-horror cinema for making low-budget movies for [[RKO Pictures]], including ''[[Cat People (1942 film)|Cat People]]'' (1942), ''[[I Walked with a Zombie]]'' (1943), ''[[The Leopard Man]]'' (1943) directed by [[Jacques Tourneur]], [[The Curse of the Cat People|''Curse of the Cat'' ''People'']] and ''[[The Body Snatcher (film)|The Body Snatcher]]'' (1945) directed by Robert Wise, a film deemed by the United States' [[National Film Registry]]  as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n\nThe decade also sees the continuation of [[Universal Pictures]]' consistent releases of horror, suspense and science fiction films. This comes to be later known as the cult classic [[Universal Classic Monsters]] series which began in the 1920s and would later dissipate in the 1950s. In this decade [[Lon Chaney Jr.]] became the studio's leading monster movie actor supplanting the previous decades' leading stars Karloff and Lugosi by a wide margin in terms of the number of leading roles that he played. Chaney is best known playing [[Larry Talbot]] in ''[[The Wolf Man (1941 film)|The Wolf Man]]'' (1941) and its sequels and crossover films. He also played Frankenstein's monster in ''[[The Ghost of Frankenstein]]'' (1942), taking over Boris Karloff in the main role. The ''Mummy'' series was also continued with ''[[The Mummy's Tomb]]'' (1942), ''[[The Mummy's Ghost]]'' and ''[[The Mummy's Curse]]'' (both 1944) all starring Chaney Jr. as the Mummy.\n\nParamount Pictures also made horror films in the 1940s, the most popular of which is ''[[The Uninvited (1944 film)|The Uninvited]]''. The film has been noted by contemporary film scholars as being the first film in history to portray ghosts as legitimate entities rather than illusions or misunderstandings played for comedy. It depicts various supernatural phenomena, including disembodied voices, apparitions, and possession. [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]]'s best horror genre contribution of the 1940s would be [[Albert Lewin]]'s ''[[The Picture of Dorian Gray (1945 film)|The Picture of Dorian Gray]]'', which was popularly known for its interesting use of color insert to show Dorian's haunting portrait.\n\nIn 1945, Great Britain contributed the anthology horror film ''[[Dead of Night]]''. In the film house guests tell at least five supernatural tales, the last of which being the most remembered. The film's last story, titled ''The Ventriloquist's Dummy'' features a ventriloquist tormented by a malevolent puppet.\n\nThe popularity of movie genres of the 1940s were mostly [[film noir]], [[melodrama]] and [[Mystery film|mystery]]. It would then arguably be a stretch to point out that some mystery and thriller films can be considered horror genre contributions of the decade. These movies include ''[[The Spiral Staircase (1946 film)|The Spiral Staircase]]'' (1946) which tells the story of a serial killer targeting women with \"afflictions\", like the mute and blind; ''[[The Seventh Victim]]'' (1943), a horror/film noir story of a woman stumbling upon a Satanic cult while looking for her missing sister; and [[John Brahm]]'s ''[[The Lodger (1944 film)|The Lodger]]'' (1944), where a landlady suspects her new lodger to be [[Jack the Ripper]].\n\n''[[The Queen of Spades (1949 film)|The Queen of Spades]]'' (1949) is a fantasy/horror film about an elderly countess who strikes a bargain with the devil and exchanges her soul for the ability to always win at cards. [[Wes Anderson]] ranked it as the sixth best British film.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.timeout.com/london/feature/842/100bbf-contributors-directors#wesanderson|title=100 Best British Films: Directors|accessdate=2012-10-14|publisher=timeout.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121221083512/http://www.timeout.com/london/feature/842/100bbf-contributors-directors#wesanderson|archive-date=21 December 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> [[Martin Scorsese]] said that ''The Queen of Spades'' is a \"stunning film\" and one of \"the few true classics of supernatural cinema.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://infoweb.newsbank.com/resources/doc/nb/news/12F8EB7A100643B0?p=UKNB |title= Tale of luckless director dealt bad hand|newspaper=The Sunday Herald}}</ref> And Dennis Schwartz of Ozus' World Movie Reviews called it \"A masterfully filmed surreal atmospheric supernatural tale\".<ref name=\"schwartz14\">{{cite web |last1=Schwartz |first1=Dennis |title=queenofspades |url=http://homepages.sover.net/~ozus/queenofspades.html |website=Sover.net |publisher=Dennis Schwartz |accessdate=22 August 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== 1950s ===\nWith advances in technology, the tone of horror films shifted from the Gothic towards contemporary concerns. A popular horror subgenre began to emerge: the [[Doomsday film]].<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">Charles Derry, ''Dark Dreams: A Psychological History of the Modern Horror Film''; A S Barnes & Co, 1977.</ref> Low-budget productions featured humanity overcoming threats such as [[alien invasion]]s and deadly [[mutation]]s to people, plants, and insects. Popular films of this genre include ''[[Creature from the Black Lagoon]]'' (1954) and ''[[The Blob]]'' (1958).\n\n1956's science fiction/horror film ''[[Invasion of the Body Snatchers]]'' concerns an extraterrestrial invasion where aliens are capable of reproducing a duplicate replacement copy of each human. It is considered to be the most popular and most paranoid films from the golden age of American sci-fi cinema.\n\nIn the 1950s, television had arrived and the theatrical market was changing. Producers and exhibitors found new, exciting and enticing ways to keep audiences in theaters. This is how Hollywood directors and producers found ample opportunity for audience exploitation through gimmicks. The years 1952 through 1954 is considered the \"Golden Era\" of 3-D movies. In a [[3D film|three-dimensional stereoscopic film]], the audience's brains are tricked into believing the images projected onto a flat cinema screen are coming to life in full three-dimensional glory.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.physics.org/article-questions.asp?id=56|title= How do 3D films work?|publisher=physics.org|date=2010-01-07}}</ref>  Through this way, the audience's fright factor is enhanced. Those who came to see a 3-D movie inside a theater were given the familiar disposable cardboard [[anaglyph 3D]] glasses to wear which will allow them to see the images come to life.\n\n[[File:Vincent Price in House on Haunted Hill.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Vincent Price]] in ''[[House on Haunted Hill]]'']]\nIn April 1953, Warner Bros. presented the horror-thriller ''[[House of Wax (1953 film)|House of Wax]]'', the first 3D feature with stereophonic sound. The film, which stars [[Vincent Price]], tells a story of a disfigured sculptor who repopulates his destroyed wax museum by murdering people and using their wax-coated corpses as displays. ''House of Wax'' was the film that typecast Price as a horror icon. A year later, he played a trademark role as a round-the-bend illusionist bent on revenge in the 3D film noir/horror ''[[The Mad Magician]]'' (1954). After the release of that film, Price would be labeled the \"King of 3-D\" and would later become the actor to star in the most 3D features. The success of these two films proved that major studios now had a method of getting film-goers back into theaters and away from television sets, which were causing a steady decline in attendance.\n\nAside from 3-D technology, different forms of promotional gimmicks were used to entice film-goers into seeing the films in theaters. One great example is during the screening of 1958's ''[[The Lost Missile]]'', a science fiction film in which scientists try to stop a mysterious missile from destroying the Earth. Audiences who saw the film in theaters were given \"shock tags\" to monitor their vitals during the movie. They were promised that anyone who would get shocked into a comatose state by the film would get a free ride home in a limousine.<ref name=\"ballyhoo\">{{cite book | title=Beyond Ballyhoo: Motion Picture Promotion and Gimmicks | first=Mark Thomas | last=McGee | publisher=McFarland & Co | year=2001 | isbn=0-7864-1114-7 | page=120 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Bg6b5FKd_HkC&pg=PA120&dq=smell-o-rama&q=smell-o-rama}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Percepto.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[The Tingler]]'', 1959: \"Can You Take Percepto?\"]]\nFilm director and producer [[William Castle]] is considered the King of the film gimmick. After directing a cavalcade of [[B movies]] (low-budget commercial films) for Columbia Pictures in the 1940s, Castle set out on the independent route. And to help sell his first self-financed film ''[[Macabre (1958 film)|Macabre]]'' (1958), he not only hired girls to stand in as fake nurses outside theater doors just in case anyone needed medical attention, he also passed out a certificate for a $1,000 life insurance policy to each member of the audience in case anyone would happen to die of fright from watching his film. This kind of promotional gimmick would later make him famous.<ref>{{cite book|last=Merritt|first=Greg|title=Celluloid Mavericks: The History of American Independent Film|page=[https://archive.org/details/celluloidmaveric00merr/page/148 148]|year=2000|publisher=Thunder's Mouth Press|isbn=978-1-56025-232-0|url=https://archive.org/details/celluloidmaveric00merr/page/148}}</ref> Other gimmicks Castle utilized in his films include ''EMERGO'' which was used during the screening of his 1959 classic ''[[House on Haunted Hill]]'' starring [[Vincent Price]]. Throughout the promotion of this film, Castle explained that through EMERGO, \u201cghosts and skeletons leave the screen and wander throughout the audience, roam around and go back to the screen\u201d. Of course, in actuality, a skeleton with glowing red eyes was attached to wires above the theater in order to swoop in and float above audience members' heads to parallel the action on the screen.<ref name=\"The Royal Ocean Film Society\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DJ-e7HfB5k|title= Smell-O-Vision, and Other Glorious Gimmicks|date=28 May 2019|publisher=The Royal Ocean Film Society}}</ref> Another Castle/Price production was ''[[The Tingler]]'' (1959) which tells the story of a scientist who discovers a parasite in human beings, called a \"tingler\", which feeds on fear. In the film, Price breaks the fourth wall and warns the audience that the tingler is in the theater which then prompts the built-in [[The Tingler#Percepto: \"Scream for your lives!\"|electric buzzers]] to scare audiences in their theater seats.\n\nThe 1950s is also well known for [[Monster movie|creature feature]] or giant monster movies. These are usually [[disaster film]]s that focuses on a group of characters struggling to survive attacks by one or more antagonistic monsters, often abnormally large ones. The monster is often created by a folly of mankind \u2013 an experiment gone wrong, the effects of radiation or the destruction of habitat. The monster can also be from outer space, or has been on Earth for a long time with no one ever seeing it, or released (or awakened) from a prison of some sort where it was being held. In monster movies, the monster is usually a villain, but can be a metaphor of humankind's continuous destruction. Warner Bros.' ''[[The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms]]'' (1953) is considered to be the film which kick-started the 1950s wave of monster movies and the concept of combining nuclear paranoia with the genre.<ref>{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Stephen|title= The Illustrated Dinosaur Movie Guide|year=1995|publisher=London: Titan Books|isbn=1-85286-487-7}}</ref> In the film, a beast was awakened from its hibernating state in the frozen ice of the Arctic Circle by an atomic bomb test. It then begins to wreak a path of destruction as it travels southward, eventually arriving at its ancient spawning grounds, which includes New York City. ''The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms'' was the first ever live-action film to feature a giant monster awakened/brought about by an atomic bomb detonation, preceding ''[[Godzilla]]'' by 16 months. The film is also remembered for its influential [[stop motion]] [[model animation]] created by visual effects creator [[Ray Harryhausen]]. One of the best movies during these years was ''[[Night of the Demon]]'' (1957).\n\n[[Ray Harryhausen]] created his own form of stop motion model animation called ''Dynamation''. It involved photographing a miniature against a rear-projection screen through a partly masked pane of glass. The masked portion would then be re-exposed to insert foreground elements from the live footage. The effect was to make the creature appear to move in the midst of live action. It could now be seen walking behind a live tree, or be viewed in the middle distance over the shoulder of a live actor \u2014 effects difficult to achieve before.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/08/movies/ray-harryhausen-cinematic-special-effects-innovator-dies-at-92.html |title=Ray Harryhausen, Whose Creatures Battled Jason and Sinbad, Dies at 92 |accessdate= May 7, 2013|work=The New York Times}}</ref> Harryhausen's innovative style of special effects in films inspired numerous filmmakers including future fantasy and horror directors [[Peter Jackson]], [[Tim Burton]], and [[Guillermo del Toro]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bfi.org.uk/news-opinion/sight-sound-magazine/comment/obituaries/mighty-ray-harryhausen |title= Mighty Ray Harryhausen: The monster movie maestro who remodelled Hollywood |date= November 30, 2016|work=bfi.org.uk}}</ref> In the 1963 fantasy film ''[[Jason and the Argonauts (1963 film)|Jason and the Argonauts]]'', there is an iconic fight scene that involves skeleton warriors.

Japan's [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|experience with Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] bore the well-known ''[[Godzilla (1954 film)|Godzilla]]'' (1954) and [[Godzilla (franchise)|its many sequels]], featuring mutation from the [[Effects of nuclear explosions|effects of nuclear radiation]]. This kickstarted the tokusatsu trend known as [[Kaiju|Kaiju films]], a Japanese film genre that features giant monsters, usually attacking major cities and engaging the military and other monsters in battle. Other films in this genre that isn't about Godzilla include ''[[Rodan (film)|Rodan]]'' (1956) and ''[[The Mysterians]]'' (1957). Besides Kaiju films, Japan was also into ghost cat/feline ghost movies in the 1950s. These include ''[[Ghost-Cat of Gojusan-Tsugi]]'' (1956), and ''[[Black Cat Mansion]]'' (1958), which tells a story of a samurai tormented by a cat possessed by the spirits of the people she killed.\n\nFilmmakers continued to merge elements of science fiction and horror over the following decades. ''[[The Fly (1958 film)|The Fly]]'' is a 1958 American science fiction-horror film starring [[Vincent Price]]. The film tells the story of a scientist who is transformed into a grotesque creature after a common house fly enters unseen into a molecular transporter he is experimenting with, resulting in his atoms being combined with those of the insect, which produces a human-fly hybrid. The film was released in [[CinemaScope]] with Color by Deluxe by 20th Century Fox. It was followed by two black-and-white sequels, ''[[Return of the Fly]]'' (1959) and ''[[Curse of the Fly]]'' (1965). The original film was remade in 1986 by director [[David Cronenberg]].\n\n[[File:Attackofthe50ftwoman.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Poster art for the 1958 sci-fi horror [[Attack of the 50 Foot Woman]]]]\nConsidered a \"pulp masterpiece\"<ref>Geoff Andrew, \"''The Incredible Shrinking Man''\", in John Pym (ed.)

His film ''[[Black Sunday (1960 film)|La Maschera del Demonio]]'' (1960), marketed in English as ''The Mask of Satan'' then wound up being known as ''Black Sunday'' in the United States and ''Revenge of the Vampire'' in the United Kingdom. In this film, Bava turned a Russian folk legend into a beguiling fairly tale about a young doctor who finds himself stranded in a haunted community and falls for a woman whose body become possessed by a woman executed for witchcraft. Three years later, Bava went on to make the horror anthology film ''[[Black Sabbath (film)|Black Sabbath]]'' (1963) known in Italy as ''I tre volti della paura'', literally 'The Three Faces of Fear'.\n\nIn the United States, gimmicks continued to be used to entice film-goers into theaters. [[William Castle]]'s 1960 horror film ''[[13 Ghosts]]'' was shot in \"''Illusion-O''\", where audiences were given a \u201csupernatural viewer\u201d that they could wear to see hidden ghosts in the film.<ref>{{cite web|title=13 Ghosts (1960) and Illusion-O!|url=http://the-haunted-closet.blogspot.com/2008/09/13-ghosts-1960-and-illusion-o.html|website=The Haunted Closet|accessdate=December 24, 2008}}</ref> In ''13 Ghosts'', a family searches for fortune inside the mansion of a reclusive doctor who died. They will need to search the house to find the doctor's fortune, but along with the property they have also inherited the occultist's collection of thirteen ghosts. In 1961, Castle made ''[[Mr. Sardonicus]]''. It tells the story of a man whose face becomes frozen in a horrifying grin while robbing his father's grave to obtain a winning lottery ticket. During the promotion of the film, Castle introduced the \u201cpunishment poll\u201d where the audiences decide what happens to Mr. Sardonicus in the film. All they had to do was hold up a \u201cthumbs up\u201d ballot if they wanted Mr. Sardonicus go free or \"thumbs down\" if they want to punish him. Supposedly no audience ever voted for life over death, so the film continues as if the audience's majority verdict was seriously counted.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Punishment Poll from Mr. Sardonicus|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJjK9njAwu0|website=YouTube|accessdate=May 27, 2007}}</ref> Also in the same year, William Castle made ''[[Homicidal]]'', which follows a murderous woman in a small California town. A \u201cfright break\u201d was featured during the film where the audiences are shown a timer over the terrifying climax. The audiences who are too frightened to see the end of the film are given 25 seconds to walk out of the theater and into the \u201ccoward's corner\u201d where they could get a full refund of their ticket and a free blood pressure test.<ref name=\"The Royal Ocean Film Society\"/>\n\n[[Francis Ford Coppola]] in his feature debut also used gimmicks in the screenings for his 1963 horror/thriller ''[[Dementia 13]]''. Before you could see the film inside the theaters, you had to pass a 13 question test that included such questions as \u201c''Did you ever do anything seriously wrong for which you felt little or no guilt?''\u201d and \u201c''Have you ever been hospitalized in a locked mental ward... or other facility for treatment of mental illness?''\u201d.

His success in ''[[House of Usher (film)|House of Usher]]'' (1960) led him to do other Poe adaptions like \n''[[Tales of Terror]]'' (1962) and ''[[The Masque of the Red Death (1964 film)|The Masque of the Red Death]]'' (1964). Other popular [[Vincent Price]] horror films include ''[[House on Haunted Hill]]'' (1959), ''[[The Comedy of Terrors]]'' (1963), ''[[War-Gods of the Deep]]'' (1965) and ''[[The Last Man on Earth (1964 film)|The Last Man on Earth]]'' (1964)  where Price becomes a reluctant Vampire hunter after becoming the last man on earth.\n\nThe British horror film ''[[The Haunting (1963 film)|The Haunting]]'' (1963) was directed and produced by [[Robert Wise]]. It is an adaptation of the 1959 horror novel ''[[The Haunting of Hill House]]'' by famed horror writer [[Shirley Jackson]]. Robert Wise's ''The Haunting'' is considered by a great many critics, aficionados, and casual fans of the horror genre to be one of the scariest films of all time. The film is best known for its brilliant use of canted frames, mirror reflections, fish-eye lenses and uncanny sound and image editing.\n\n[[Roman Polanski]] made his first film in English with ''[[Repulsion (film)|Repulsion]]'' (1965), which is considered to be his scariest and most disturbing work. Polanski's \"evocations of sexual panic and masterful use of sound puts the audiences' imagination to work in numerous ways\".<ref>Steven Jay Schneider (2009). \"1001 Movies You Should Watch Before You Die\".</ref> This psychological horror film tells the story of a young withdrawn woman who finds sexual advances repulsive and who, after she is left alone, becomes even more isolated and detached from reality.\n\n[[File:Miles and Flora in The Innocents.png|thumb|200px|left|A key point of dispute between Clayton and screenwriter [[William Archibald (playwright)|William Archibald]] in ''The Innocents'' was whether the children (pictured) were conduits for malicious spirits, or the phenomena was the invention of the protagonist's mind]]\nHorror films of the 1960s used the supernatural premise to express the [[horror-of-demonic|horror of the demonic]].

The story was based on [[Henry James]]' 1898 horror novella ''[[The Turn of the Screw]]''. A few years later, [[Roman Polanski]] wrote and directed ''[[Rosemary's Baby (film)|Rosemary's Baby]]'' (1968), based on the bestselling horror novel by [[Ira Levin]]. The highly influential film tells the story of a pregnant woman who suspects that an evil cult wants to take her baby for use in their rituals.

Considered to be the first true [[zombie]] movie, the film began to combine psychological insights with gore. Distancing the era from earlier gothic trends, late 1960s films brought horror into everyday life.\n\nLow-budget [[splatter film]]s from the likes of [[Herschell Gordon Lewis]] also gained prominence in the 1960s.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Wilson|first1=Karina|title=Horror Movies In The 1960s: Bad Girls And Blood Freaks|url=http://www.horrorfilmhistory.com/index.php?pageID=1960s|website=Horror Film History|accessdate=14 October 2017}}</ref> It's the precursor to \"torture porn\" movies that would become popular in the following decades. Some of Lewis' notorious works include ''[[Two Thousand Maniacs!]]'' (1964) which follows a group of Northern tourists savagely tortured and murdered during a Confederate celebration of a small southern community's centennial; and ''[[Color Me Blood Red]]'' (1965), a story about a psychotic painter who murders civilians and uses their blood as red paint.\n\nIn television, the animated mystery [[Hanna-Barbera]] series ''[[Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!]]'' was broadcast from 1969 to 1970. The series centers on a group of teenagers and their dog who go to abandoned places to solve mysteries involving supposedly supernatural creatures through a series of antics and missteps. The animated series' simple formula had a major impact on future [[slasher films]] especially of its portrayal of villains in masks.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://bloody-disgusting.com/editorials/3435783/influence-scooby-doo-modern-slasher-film/|title=The Influence of \"Scooby Doo\" On the Slasher Film|publisher=Bloody Disgusting}}</ref>\n\n=== 1970s\u20131980s ===\n[[File:Suspiria 1977.jpg|thumb|240px|Suzy ([[Jessica Harper]], right) and Sara ([[Stefania Casini]], left) in ''[[Suspiria]]'', an Italian [[supernatural horror]] film.]]\nThe 1970s began a new age for horror films with the transition from \"classic\" to modern horror.

Modern horror films took the expected roles of characters in the films and changed them.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThis era changed the usual setting for horror films, using every-day settings. Along with this came a change from focusing on defeating evil every time to having some instances where good fails before succeeding.<ref name=\":1\" /> The critical and popular success of ''Rosemary's Baby'', led to the release of more films with occult themes in the 1970s, such as ''[[The Omen]]'' (1976), wherein a man realizes that his five-year-old adopted son is the [[Antichrist]]. Invincible to human intervention, demons became villains in many horror films with a [[Postmodernism|postmodern]] style and a [[dystopia]]n worldview.\n\n''[[Don't Look Now]]'' (1973), an independent British-Italian film directed by [[Nicolas Roeg]], was also notable. Its focus on the psychology of grief was unusually strong for a film featuring a supernatural horror plot. Another notable film is ''[[The Wicker Man]]'' (1973), a British [[Mystery film|mystery]] horror film dealing with the practice of ancient pagan rituals in the modern era. In the 1970s, Italian filmmakers [[Mario Bava]], [[Riccardo Freda]], [[Antonio Margheriti]], and [[Dario Argento]] developed [[giallo]] horror films that became classics and influenced the genre in other countries. Representative films include: ''[[The Bird with the Crystal Plumage]],''[[Twitch of the Death Nerve]]'', and ''[[Deep Red]]''.\n\nThe ideas of the 1960s began to influence horror films in the 70s, as the youth involved in the [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]] began exploring the medium.

Next, was his third published novel, ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]'' (1980), directed by [[Stanley Kubrick]], which was a [[Sleeper hit|sleeper]] at the box office. At first, many critics and viewers had negative feedback toward ''The Shining''. However, the film is now known as one of Hollywood's most classic horror films.\n\nThis psychological horror film has a variety of themes: \"evil children\", alcoholism, [[telepathy]], and insanity. This type of film is an example of how Hollywood's idea of horror started to evolve. Murder and violence were no longer the main themes of horror films. In the 1970s and 1980s, psychological and supernatural horror started to take over cinema. Another classic Hollywood horror film is [[Tobe Hooper]]'s ''[[Poltergeist (1982 film)|Poltergeist]]'' (1982). ''Poltergeist'' is ranked the 20th scariest movie ever made by the [[Chicago Film Critics Association]]. Both ''The Shining'' and ''Poltergeist'' involve horror being based on real-estate values. The evil and horror throughout the films come from where the movies are taking place.<ref>''The American Horror Film'' by Reynold Humphries</ref><ref>''American Horror Film'' edited by Stefen Hantke</ref>\n\n''[[The Amityville Horror (1979 film)|The Amityville Horror]]'' is a 1979 supernatural horror film directed by [[Stuart Rosenberg]], based on [[Jay Anson]]'s [[1977 in literature|1977]] [[The Amityville Horror|book of the same name]]. It stars [[James Brolin]] and [[Margot Kidder]] as a young couple who purchase a home they come to find haunted by combative supernatural forces. ''[[The Changeling (1980 film)|The Changeling]]'' is a 1980 Canadian supernatural psychological horror film directed by [[Peter Medak]].\n\n[[Steven Spielberg]]'s shark horror film, ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'' (1975), began a new wave of killer animal stories, such as ''[[Orca (film)|Orca]]'' (1977) and ''[[Up from the Depths]]'' (1979). ''Jaws'' is often credited as being one of the first films to use traditionally [[B movie]] elements such as horror and mild gore in a big-budget Hollywood film. In 1979, [[Don Coscarelli]]'s ''[[Phantasm (film)|Phantasm]]'' was the first of the [[Phantasm (franchise)|Phantasm series]].\n\nA cycle of [[slasher film]]s began in the 1970s and 1980s with the creation of ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'' by [[John Carpenter]]. \"Halloween\" was a significant influence on the horror industry and has become one of the quintessential forerunners of commercial horror films, grossing 70 Million usd on a shoestring budget of $300,000\u2013325,000.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Halloween-(1978)|title=Halloween (1978) - Financial Information|website=The Numbers}}</ref> Its influence and inspiration can still be seen in films today.\n\nAnother notable 1970s slasher films are [[Bob Clark]]'s ''[[Black Christmas (1974 film)|Black Christmas]]'' (1974). ''[[Sleepaway Camp]]'' (1983) is known for its [[twist ending]], which is considered by some to be one of the most shocking endings among horror films. ''[[My Bloody Valentine (film)|My Bloody Valentine]]'' (1981) is a slasher film dealing with [[Valentine's Day]] fiction.\n\nThe boom in slasher films provided enough material for numerous comedic [[Parody film|spoofs]] of the genre including ''[[Saturday the 14th]]'' (1981), ''[[Student Bodies]]'' (1981), ''[[National Lampoon's Class Reunion]]'' (1982), and ''[[Hysterical (film)|Hysterical]]'' (1983).\n\nThis subgenre would be mined by dozens of increasingly violent movies throughout the subsequent decades. [[Sean S. Cunningham]] made ''[[Friday the 13th (1980 film)|Friday the 13th]]'' (1980), [[Wes Craven]] directed ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'' (1984), and [[Clive Barker]] made ''[[Hellraiser]]'' (1987).\n\nSome films explored [[urban legend]]s such as \"[[The babysitter and the man upstairs]]\".\nA notable example is ''[[When a Stranger Calls (1979 film)|When a Stranger Calls]]'' (1979), an American psychological horror film directed by [[Fred Walton (director)|Fred Walton]] starring [[Carol Kane]] and [[Charles Durning]].\n\n''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'' (1979), a British-American [[science fiction film|science-fiction]] horror film directed by [[Ridley Scott]] was very successful, receiving both critical acclaim and being a box office success. John Carpenter's movie ''[[The Thing (1982 film)|The Thing]]'' (1982) was also a mix of horror and sci-fi, but it was neither a box-office nor critical hit, but soon became a cult classic. However, nearly 20 years after its release, it was praised for using ahead-of-its-time special effects and paranoia.\n\nThe 1980s saw a wave of gory \"B movie\" horror films \u2013 although most of them were poorly reviewed by critics, many became [[cult film|cult classics]] and later saw success with critics. A significant example is [[Sam Raimi]]'s ''[[The Evil Dead (franchise)|Evil Dead]]'' movies, which were low-budget gorefests but had a very original plotline which was later praised by critics. In the Philippines, the first ''[[Shake, Rattle & Roll (film)|Shake, Rattle & Roll]]'' (1984) was released. The horror anthology film spawned [[Shake, Rattle & Roll (film series)|a series of films]] in the country over the subsequent decades.\n\n''[[Day of the Dead (1985 film)|Day of the Dead]]'' is a 1985 horror film written and directed by [[George A. Romero]] and the third film in Romero's ''[[Night of the Living Dead (film series)|Night of the Living Dead]]'' series.\n\n[[Vampire films|Vampire horror]] was also popular in the 1980s, including cult vampire classics such as ''[[Fright Night]]'' (1985), ''[[The Lost Boys]]'' (1987), and ''[[Near Dark]]'' (also 1987). In 1984, [[Joe Dante]]'s seminal monster comedy horror ''[[Gremlins]]'' became a box office hit with critics and audiences, and inspired a trend of \"little monster\" films such as ''[[Critters (film)|Critters]]'' and ''[[Ghoulies]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/how-gremlins-spawned-a-mini-monster-trend-30-years-87121103742.html|title=How 'Gremlins' Spawned a Mini-Monster Trend 30 Years Ago|website=www.yahoo.com|publisher=Yahoo!

The slasher films, ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'', ''[[Friday the 13th (1980 film)|Friday the 13th]]'', ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'', and ''[[Child's Play (1988 film)|Child's Play]]'', all saw sequels in the 1990s, most of which met with varied amounts of success at the box office, but all were negatively reviewed by critics, with the exception of Wes Craven's ''[[Wes Craven's New Nightmare|New Nightmare]]'' (1994), and the hugely successful film, ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|The Silence of the Lambs]]'' (1991). The latter, which stars [[Jodie Foster]] and [[Anthony Hopkins]], is considered a major horror movie of all times.<ref>[https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-16344420 \"Silence of the Lambs Added to US Film Archive\"] (28 December 2011). ''BBC.com''. Retrieved 24 June 2018.</ref> ''[[Misery (film)|Misery]]'' (1990) also deals with a psychopath, and the film received critical acclaim for [[Kathy Bates]]'s performance as the psychopathic [[Annie Wilkes]].\nTSeven 1995 Brad Pitt Morgan Freeman Kevin Spacey\n''[[Wes Craven's New Nightmare|New Nightmare]]'', with ''[[In the Mouth of Madness]]'' (1995), ''[[The Dark Half (film)|The Dark Half]]'' (1993), and ''[[Candyman (1992 film)|Candyman]]'' (1992), were part of a mini-movement of self-reflexive or [[metafiction]]al horror films. Each film touched upon the relationship between fictional horror and real-world horror. ''Candyman'', for example, examined the link between an invented urban legend, and the realistic horror of the racism that produced its villain. ''In the Mouth of Madness'' took a more literal approach, as its protagonist actually hopped from the real world into a novel created by the madman he was hired to track down. This reflective style became more overt and ironic with the arrival of ''[[Scream (1996 film)|Scream]]'' (1996).\nIn ''[[Interview with the Vampire (film)|Interview with the Vampire]]'' (1994), the \"Theatre de Vampires\" (and the film itself, to some degree) invoked the [[Grand Guignol]] style, perhaps to further remove the undead performers from humanity, morality and class. The horror movie soon continued its search for new and effective frights. In the 1985 novel, ''[[The Vampire Lestat]]'', by the author [[Anne Rice]] (who penned ''Interview with the Vampire''{{'}}s screenplay and the 1976 novel of the same name) suggests that its antihero Lestat inspired and nurtured the Grand Guignol style and theatre.\n\nTwo main problems pushed horror backward during this period: firstly, the horror genre wore itself out with the proliferation of nonstop slasher and gore films in the eighties. Secondly, the adolescent audience which feasted on the blood and morbidity of the previous decade grew up, and the replacement audience for films of an imaginative nature were being captured instead by the explosion of [[Science fiction film|science-fiction]] and fantasy films, courtesy of the special effects possibilities with advances made in [[computer-generated imagery]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mediaknowall.com/Horror/eighties.html |title=Horror Films in the 1980s |publisher=Mediaknowall.com |accessdate=24 April 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217005221/http://www.mediaknowall.com/Horror/eighties.html |archivedate=17 February 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>  Examples of these CGI include movies like ''[[Species (film)|Species]]'' (1995), ''[[Anaconda (film)|Anaconda]]'' (1997), ''[[Mimic (film)|Mimic]]'' (1997), ''[[Blade (film)|Blade]]'' (1998), ''[[Deep Rising]]'' (1998), ''[[House on Haunted Hill (1999 film)|House on Haunted Hill]]'' (1999), ''[[Sleepy Hollow (film)|Sleepy Hollow]]'' (1999), and ''[[The Haunting (1999 film)|The Haunting]]'' (1999).\n\nTo re-connect with its audience, horror became more self-mockingly [[Irony|ironic]] and outright [[Parody|parodic]], especially in the latter half of the 1990s. Peter Jackson's ''[[Braindead (1992 film)|Braindead]]'' (1992) (known as ''Dead Alive'' in the United States) took the [[splatter film]] to ridiculous excesses for comic effect. Wes Craven's ''[[Scream (1996 film)|Scream]]'' (written by [[Kevin Williamson (screenwriter)|Kevin Williamson]]) movies, starting in 1996, featured teenagers who were fully aware of, and often made reference to, the history of horror movies, and mixed ironic humour with the shocks (despite ''[[Scream 2]]'' and ''[[Scream 3]]'' utilising less use of the humour of the original, until ''[[Scream 4]]'' in 2011, and rather more references to horror film conventions). Along with ''[[I Know What You Did Last Summer]]'' (1997) (also written by Williamson) and ''[[Urban Legend (film)|Urban Legend]]'' (1998), they re-ignited the dormant [[slasher film]] genre.\n\n''[[Event Horizon (film)|Event Horizon]]'' (1997) is a British-American science fiction horror film directed by [[Paul W. S. Anderson]]. ''[[The Sixth Sense]]'' (1999) is a supernatural horror film written and directed by [[M. Night Shyamalan]], which tells the story of Cole Sear ([[Haley Joel Osment]]), a troubled, isolated boy who is able to see and talk to the dead, and an equally troubled [[child psychologist]] named Malcolm Crowe ([[Bruce Willis]]) who tries to help him.\n\n''[[House on Haunted Hill (1999 film)|House on Haunted Hill]]'' is a 1999 horror film directed by [[William Malone (director)|William Malone]] which follows a group of strangers who are invited to a party at an abandoned asylum, where they are offered $1 million each by an amusement park [[Magnate|mogul]] if they are able to survive the night. It is a remake of the [[House on Haunted Hill|1959 film of the same title]]. Other horror films of the late 1990s include ''[[Cube (film)|Cube]]'' (1997), ''[[The Faculty]]'' (1998), ''[[Disturbing Behavior]]'' (1998), ''[[Stir of Echoes]]'' (1999), ''[[Stigmata (film)|Stigmata]]'' (1999), and ''[[Existenz]]'' (1999).\n\n[[Monster]] horror was quite popular in the 1990s. ''[[Tremors (film)|Tremors]]'' (1990) is\nthe first installment of the [[Tremors (franchise)|''Tremors'' series]]. ''[[Lake Placid (film)|Lake Placid]]'' (1999) is another monster horror film, written by [[David E.

Around this period, [[Japanese horror]] started becoming popular in English speaking countries.\n\nIn South Korea, the success of [[supernatural horror film]] [[Whispering Corridors]] (1998) by\nPark Ki-hyung, sparked the explosion of Korean horror.\n\nThe film ''[[The Last Broadcast (film)|The Last Broadcast]]'' (1998) served as inspiration for the highly successful ''[[The Blair Witch Project]]'' (1999), which popularized the [[Found footage (film technique)|found footage]] horror subgenre. The theme of [[witchcraft]] was also addressed in ''[[The Witches (1990 film)|The Witches]]'' (1990), starring [[Anjelica Huston]], and ''[[The Craft (film)|The Craft]]'' (1996), a supernatural horror film directed by [[Andrew Fleming]].

It is a 2001 English-language Spanish [[Gothic fiction|gothic]] [[supernatural]] [[psychological horror]] film. It was written, directed, and scored by [[Alejandro Amen\u00e1bar]]. It stars [[Nicole Kidman]] and [[Fionnula Flanagan]].\n\nSequels, such as ''[[Jason X]]'' (2001) and ''[[Freddy vs. Jason]]'' (2003) also made a stand in theaters. ''[[Final Destination (film)|Final Destination]]'' (2000) marked a successful revival of teen-centered horror and spawned five installments. ''[[Jeepers Creepers (2001 film)|Jeepers Creepers]]'' series was also successful. Films such as ''[[Hollow Man]]'' (2000), ''[[Cabin Fever (2002 film)|Cabin Fever]]'' (2002), ''[[House of 1000 Corpses]]'' (2003) (the latter an [[exploitation film|exploitation]] horror film written, co-scored and directed by [[Rob Zombie]] in his [[List of directorial debuts|directorial debut]]) and the previous mentions helped bring the genre back to Restricted ratings in theaters.

Another notable film is ''[[Drag Me to Hell]]'', a 2009 American supernatural horror film co-written and directed by [[Sam Raimi]]. ''[[The Strangers (2008 film)|The Strangers]]'' (2008) deals with unprovoked stranger-on-stranger violence. ''[[The House of the Devil]]'' (2009) is inspired by the \"[[Satanic ritual abuse#As a moral panic|satanic panic]]\" of the 1980s. ''[[Trick 'r Treat]]'' is a 2007 [[Anthology film|anthology]] horror film written and directed by [[Michael Dougherty]] and produced by [[Bryan Singer]]. ''[[Black Water (2007 film)|Black Water]]'' (2007) is a British-Australian natural horror film.

Other video game adaptations like ''[[Doom (film)|Doom]]'' (2005) and ''[[Silent Hill (film)|Silent Hill]]'' (2006) also had moderate box office success.\n\nSome pronounced trends have marked horror films. Films from non-English language countries have become successful. The ''[[El espinazo del diablo|Devil's Backbone]]'' (2001) is such an example. It is a 2001 [[Spanish films of 2001|Spanish]]-[[Cinema of Mexico|Mexican]] [[Gothic fiction|gothic horror film]] directed by [[Guillermo del Toro]], and written by del Toro, [[David Mu\u00f1oz (director)|David Mu\u00f1oz]], and [[Antonio Trashorras]].

''[[Cold Prey]]'' is a 2006 Norwegian slasher film directed by [[Roar Uthaug]].\n\nAnother trend is the emergence of psychology to scare audiences, rather than gore.

Distinct subgenres have evolved, such as the [[zombie comedy]], which may or may not retain a significant horror theme, and often crosses into [[black comedy]]. Examples include: ''[[I Walked with a Zombie]]'', ''[[White Zombie (film)|White Zombie]]'', ''[[Night of the Living Dead]]'', ''[[Dawn of the Dead (1978 film)|Dawn of the Dead]]'', ''[[REC (film)|REC]]'', ''[[28 Days Later]]'', ''[[Deadgirl]]'', ''[[Dead Snow]]'', ''[[Night of the Creeps]]'', and ''[[Messiah of Evil]]''.\n\n==Psychological effects of horror films==\n\n=== Neurocinematics - the subconscious effect of horror films on the audience ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=November 2019}}\nIn a study done by Uri Hasson et al., brain waves were observed via [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI). This study used the inter-subject correlation analysis (ISC) method of determining results. It was shown that audience members tend to focus on certain facets in a particular scene simultaneously and tend to sit as still as possible while watching horror films. In another study done by Glenn Sparks, it was found that the audience tends to experience the [[Excitation-transfer theory|excitation transfer process]] (ETP) which causes a physiological arousal in audience members. The ETP refers to the feelings experienced immediately after watching a horror film, specifically in which audience members\u2019 heart rate, blood pressure and respiration all increase. Audience members with positive feedback regarding the horror film have feelings similar to happiness or joy felt with friends, but intensified. Alternatively, audience members with negative feedback regarding the film would typically feel emotions they would normally associate with negative experiences in their life. Only about 10% of the American population enjoy the physiological rush felt immediately after watching horror films. The population that does not enjoy horror films could experience emotional fallout similar to that of [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|PTSD]] if the environment reminds them of particular scenes.\n\n=== Different techniques employed by horror films on the audience ===\nIn a study by Jacob Shelton, the many ways that audience members are manipulated through horror films was investigated in detail.<ref name=\":03\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.ranker.com/list/horror-movie-tricks-for-scaring-the-audience/jacob-shelton|title=15 Ways You Didn't Even Realize Horror Movies Are Manipulating You Into Fear|website=Ranker|language=en|access-date=2019-11-22}}</ref> [[Negative space]] is one such method that can play a part in inducing a reaction, causing one's eyes to remotely rest on anything in the frame - a wall, or the empty black void in the shadows.<ref name=\":03\" /> In an ideal horror film, there is a perfect balance of negative and positive space.<ref name=\":03\" /> Another method is a [[subversion]] of classic horror tropes - the [[jump scare]].<ref name=\":03\" /> In classic horror films, the jump scare is right after an individual closes the bathroom mirror with their reflection shown or other such situations.<ref name=\":03\" /> Alternatively, it is when there is no jump scare that causes the audience to feel more unease and discomfort because they do not know when it will happen, only that it is anticipated.<ref name=\":03\" />\n\nThe meaning of mirrors in horror films is that they create visual depth that builds tension.<ref name=\":03\"/> Audience members have ingrained the fear of mirrors due to the use of them in classic horror films.<ref name=\":03\" /> Even if there is no jump scare succeeding a mirror scene, individuals are still trained to fear the mirror no matter what.<ref name=\":03\" /> Mirrors illustrate the characters' duality and \u201creal\u201d version of themselves.<ref name=\":03\" /> In any case, mirrors altogether make the audience anxious, while patiently waiting for a jump scare that may or may not occur.<ref name=\":03\" />\n\nTight framing is another technique used, where an entire scene can be created with a [[close-up]].<ref name=\":03\" /> Tight framing can be terrifying as they induce anxiety by not allowing the viewer to see what's directly around the [[protagonist]].<ref name=\":03\" /> The suspense of not knowing builds on the unknown and tension of the audience.<ref name=\":03\" />\n\n=== Physical effects of horror films on the audience ===\nIn a study by Medes et al., prolonged exposure to [[infrasound]] and low-frequency noise (<500&nbsp;Hz) in long durations has an effect on vocal range (i.e. longer exposure tends to form a lower phonation frequency range).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mendes|first=Ana P.|date=Fall 2019|title=Voice Acoustic Profile of Males Exposed to Occupational Infrasound and Low-Frequency Noise|journal=Journal of Laryngology & Voice|volume=4|pages=12\u201320|doi=10.4103/2230-9748.141460|hdl=10400.26/14507|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/9a2da891e571fc137548efa5493973cf3651c711}}</ref> Another study by Baliatsas et al. observed that there is a correlation between exposure to infrasound and low-frequency noises and sleep-related problems.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Baliatsas|first=Christos|date=Fall 2019|title=Health Effects from Low-Frequency Noise and Infrasound in the General Population: Is It Time to Listen?

One of the most noticeable side effects is sleeplessness. A person may have trouble sleeping or toss all night due to the residual fear and anxiety from watching a horror movie. They can cause trauma if their content is similar to real life events. For example, if a person went through a serious car accident, a film such as ''[[Final Destination 2]]'' could be harmful for the person\u2019s mental health.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20180815101243/https://edinazephyrus.com/psychological-effects-of-horror-movies/</ref>\n\n==Influences==\n===Influences on society===\nHorror films' evolution throughout the years has given society a new approach to resourcefully utilize their benefits. The horror film style has changed over time, but, in 1996, ''Scream'' set off a \"chain of copycats\", leading to a new variety of teenage, horror movies.<ref name=Stack>{{cite magazine|last=Stack|first=Tim|title=Oh, The Horror.|url=http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?vid=3&hid=21&sid=f974de41-a7e4-4577-88d9-fbc1438149fa@sessionmgr14&bdata=JmxvZ2luLmFzcCZzaXRlPWVob3N0LWxpdmU=|magazine=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=19 April 2012}}</ref> This new approach to horror films began to gradually earn more and more revenue as seen in the progress of ''Scream'' movies; the first movie earned $6 million and the third movie earned $101 million.<ref name=Stack /> The importance that horror films have gained in the public and producers\u2019 eyes is one obvious effect on our society.\n\nHorror films' income expansion is only the first sign of the influences of horror flicks. The role of women and how women see themselves in the movie industry has been altered by the horror genre. Early horror films such as ''[[My Bloody Valentine (film)|My Bloody Valentine]]'' (1981), ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'' (1978), and ''[[Friday the 13th (1980 film)|Friday the 13th]]'' (1980) were produced mostly for male audiences in order to \"feed the fantasies of young men\".<ref name=Nowell>{{cite web|last=Nowell|first=Richard|title=\"There's More Than One Way to Lose Your Heart\": the American film industry, early teen slasher films, and female youth.\"|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/retrieve.do?sgHitCountType=None&sort=DA-SORT&inPS=true&prodId=GPS&userGroupName=mtlib_1_1123&tabID=T002&searchId=R2&resultListType=RESULT_LIST&contentSegment=&searchType=BasicSearchForm\u00a4tPosition=4&contentSet=GALE%7CA277106285&&docId=GALE%7cA277106285&docType=GALE&role=AONE|publisher=Cinema Journal|accessdate=24 April 2012}}</ref> This idea is no longer prevalent in horror films, as women have become not only the main audience and fans of horror films but also the main protagonists of contemporary horror films.<ref name=Spines>{{cite magazine|last=Spines|first=Christine|title=Chicks dig scary movies.|url=https://www.ew.com/article/2009/07/24/chicks-dig-scary-movies|magazine=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=15 April 2012}}</ref> Movie makers have also begun to integrate topics more broadly associated with other genres into their films in order to grow audience appeal.<ref name=Nowell />\n\nMany early horror films created great social and legal [[controversy]]. In the U.S., the [[Motion Picture Production Code]] which was implemented in 1930, set moral guidelines for film content, restraining movies containing controversial themes, graphic violence, explicit sexuality and/or nudity. The gradual abandonment of the Code, and its eventual formal repeal in 1968 (when it was replaced by the [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|MPAA film rating system]]) offered more freedom to the movie industry. Nevertheless, controversy continued to surround horror movies, and many continued to face [[censorship]] issues around the world. For example, 1978's ''[[I Spit on Your Grave]]'', an American [[rape and revenge film|rape-and-revenge]] [[exploitation film|exploitation]] horror film written, co-produced, directed, and edited by [[Meir Zarchi]], was received negatively by critics, but it attracted a great deal of national and international attention due to its explicit scenes of rape, murder and prolonged nudity, which led to bans in countries such as Ireland, Norway, Iceland, and West Germany. Many of these countries later removed the ban, but the film remains prohibited in Ireland.<ref>Clarke, Donald (29 September 2010).

The best known of these early supernatural-based works is the 3-minute short film ''[[The Haunted Castle (1896 film)|Le Manoir du Diable]]'' (1896), known in English as both ''\"[[The Haunted Castle (1897 French film)|The Haunted Castle\"]]'' or ''\"The House of the Devil\"''. The film is sometimes credited as being the first ever horror film.<ref name=truorg/> In ''The Haunted Castle'', a mischievous devil appears inside a medieval castle where he harasses the visitors. M\u00e9li\u00e8s' other popular horror film is ''[[La Caverne maudite]]'' (1898), which translates literally as \"the accursed cave\". The film, also known by its English title ''The Cave of the Demons'', tells the story of a woman stumbling over a cave that is populated by the spirits and skeletons of people who died there.<ref name=\"truorg\">{{cite web|url=http://pages.emerson.edu/organizations/fas/latent_image/issues/1990-05/horror.htm |title=The True Origin of the Horror Film |publisher=Pages.emerson.edu |accessdate=24 April 2012}}</ref> M\u00e9li\u00e8s would also make other short films that historians consider now as horror-comedies. ''[[Une nuit terrible]]'' (1896), which translates to ''A Terrible Night'', tells a story of a man who tries to get a good night's sleep but ends up wrestling a giant spider. His other film, ''[[The Bewitched Inn|L'auberge ensorcel\u00e9e]]'' (1897), or ''The Bewitched Inn'', features a story of a hotel guest being pranked and tormented by an unseen presence.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPvs7nfaFBc|title=\"L'auberge Ensorcele\" (\"The Bewitched Inn\", French silent film)|date=16 September 2012|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref> \n[[File:M\u00e9li\u00e8s, Le ch\u00e2teau hant\u00e9 (Star Film 96, 1897).jpg|thumb|200px|left|Colorized scene from [[Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s]] 1897 short film ''[[Le Manoir du diable]]'', or ''The Haunted Castle'']]\n\nIn 1897, the American photographer-turned director [[George Albert Smith]] created [[The X-Rays|''The X-Ray Fiend'']] (1897), a horror-comedy [[trick film]] that came out a mere two years after x-rays were invented. The film shows a couple of skeletons courting each other. An audience full of people unaccustomed to seeing moving skeletons on screen would have found it frightening and otherworldly.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLbC7Y3EogU|title=George Albert Smith : The X-Ray Fiend \u2013 1897|date=3 March 2015|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref> The next year, Smith created the short film ''[[Photographing a Ghost]]'' (1898), considered a precursor to the paranormal investigation subgenre. The film portrays three men attempting to photograph a ghost, only to fail time and again as the [[ghost]] eludes the men and throws chairs at them.\n\n[[File:Le Spectre rouge (1907) de Chom\u00f3n.jpg|thumb|right|180px|''[[Sat\u00e1n se divierte]]'', or ''Satan at Play'' (1907)]]\n[[Cinema of Japan|Japan]] also made early forays into the horror genre. In 1898, a Japanese film company called Konishi Honten released two horror films both written by Ejiro Hatta. These were ''[[Shinin No Sosei]]'' (Resurrection of a Corpse), and ''[[Bake Jizo]]'' (Jizo the Spook)<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.japanzine.jp/article/jz/955/jhorror-an-alternative-guide|title=J-Horror: An Alternative Guide|date=29 September 2006|magazine=[[Japanzine]]|access-date=6 December 2016}}</ref> The film ''Shinin No Sosei'' told the story of a dead man who comes back to life after having fallen from a coffin that two men were carrying. The writer Hatta played the dead man role, while the coffin-bearers were played by Konishi Honten employees. Though there are no records of the cast, crew, or plot of ''Bake Jizo'', it was likely based on the Japanese legend of [[K\u1e63itigarbha|Jizo]] statues, believed to provide safety and protection to children. In Japan, Jiz\u014d is a [[deity]] who is seen as the guardian of children, particularly children who have died before their parents. Jiz\u014d has been worshiped as the guardian of the souls of ''mizuko'', namely stillborn, miscarried, or aborted fetuses. The presence of the word bake\u2014which can be translated to \"spook,\" \"ghost,\" or \"phantom\"\u2014may imply a haunted or possessed statue.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://reelrundown.com/film-industry/The-First-13-Horror-Films-in-Recorded-History|title=The First 13 Horror Films in Recorded History|date=21 May 2018|publisher=[[ReelRundown]]|access-date=21 May 2018}}</ref>\n[[File:La_casa_hechizada_(1906)_de_Chom\u00f3n.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Segundo de Chom\u00f3n]] produced a handful of impressive [[trick film]]s, including this one; ''[[The House of Ghosts|La casa hechizada]]'', or ''The House of Ghosts'' made in 1908.]]\n\nSpanish filmmaker [[Segundo de Chom\u00f3n]] is also one of the most significant silent film directors in early filmmaking.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://filmdirtblog.blogspot.com/2015/10/the-short-spooky-films-of-segundo-de.html|title=The Short, Spooky Films of Segundo de Chom\u00f3n, \"The Spanish M\u00e9li\u00e8s\"|publisher=Film Dirt|date=2015-10-12}}</ref> He was popular for his frequent camera tricks and optical illusions, an innovation that contributed heavily to the popularity of [[trick film]]s in the period. His famous works include ''[[Sat\u00e1n se divierte]]'' (1907), which translates to ''Satan Having Fun'', or ''Satan at Play''; ''[[The House of Ghosts|La casa hechizada]]'' (1908), or ''The House of Ghosts'', considered to be one of the earliest cinematic depictions of a haunted house premise; and ''[[Le spectre rouge]]'' (1907) or ''The Red Spectre'', a collaboration film with French director [[Ferdinand Zecca]] about a demonic magician who attempts to perform his act in a mysterious grotto.\n\nThe [[Selig Polyscope Company]] in the United States produced one of the first film adaptations of a horror-based novel. In 1908, the company produced the film ''[[Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1908 film)|Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde]]'', directed by [[Otis Turner]] and starring [[Hobart Bosworth]] in the lead role. The film is, however, now considered a lost film. The story was based on [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s classic gothic novella ''[[Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde]]'', published 15 years prior, about a man who transforms his personality between two contrasting personas. (The book tells the classic story of a man with an unpredictably dual nature: usually very good, but sometimes shockingly evil as well.)\n\nGeorges M\u00e9li\u00e8s also liked adapting the [[Faust]] legend into his films. In fact, the French filmmaker produced at least six variations of the German legend of the man who made a pact with the devil. Among his notable Faust films include ''[[The Damnation of Faust (film)|Faust aux enfers]]'' (1903), known primarily for its English title ''The Damnation of Faust'', or ''Faust in Hell''. It is the filmmaker's third film adaptation of the Faust legend. In it, M\u00e9li\u00e8s took inspiration from [[Hector Berlioz]]'s Faust [[La damnation de Faust|opera]], but it pays less attention to the story and more to the special effects that represent a tour of hell. The film takes advantage of stage machinery techniques and features special effects such as pyrotechnics, substitution splices, superimpositions on black backgrounds, and dissolves.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqnpWepNtLs|title=Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s: Faust in Hell (1903)|date=25 November 2015|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref> M\u00e9li\u00e8s then made a sequel to that film called ''[[Damnation du docteur Faust]]'' (1904), released in the U.S. as ''Faust and Marguerite''. This time, the film was based on the [[Faust (opera)|opera]] by [[Charles Gounod]]. M\u00e9li\u00e8s' other devil-inspired films in this period include ''[[The Merry Frolics of Satan|Les quat'cents farces du diable]]'' (1906), known in English as ''The Merry Frolics of Satan'' or ''The 400 Tricks of the Devil'', a tale about an engineer who barters with the Devil for superhuman powers and is forced to face the consequences. M\u00e9li\u00e8s would also make other horror-based short films that aren't inspired by Faust, most notably the fantastical and unsettling ''[[The Spider and the Butterfly|Le papillon fantastique]]'' (1909), where a magician turns a butterfly woman into a spider beast.\n\n==== Trick Films ====\n[[File:The_Haunted_Curiosity_Shop_(1901).ogv|thumb|200px|left|''The Haunted Curiosity Shop'' was clearly devised purely as a showcase for Booth and Paul's bag of tricks'' and according to Michael Brooke of BFI Screenonline, \"it's an effective and engrossing experience.]]\nAs the 19th century gave way to the 20th, artists and engineers were all pushing the boundaries of film. Artists like M\u00e9li\u00e8s, first achieved fame as a magician. During the time, stage magicians entertained large crowds with illusions and magic tricks, and decked out their sets with elaborate sets, costumes, and characters. While filmmakers like the [[Auguste and Louis Lumi\u00e8re|Lumi\u00e8re brothers]] were tinkering with motion picture devices and shot documentary-like films, M\u00e9li\u00e8s, and to an extent, [[Segundo de Chom\u00f3n]] as well, were developing magic tricks on film. They created sophisticated sight gags and theatrical special effects to either entertain or scare the audience.<ref name=\"CrashCourse\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8is28gAOTc|title=Georges Melies \u2013 Master of Illusion: Crash Course Film History #4|date=4 May 2017|publisher=CrashCourse}}</ref>\n\nIn his autobiography, M\u00e9li\u00e8s recalled a day when he was capturing footage on a Paris street when his camera jammed. Frustrated, he fiddled with the hand crank, fixed the problem, and started shooting again. When he developed the film later, and played it back, he discovered a new trick. The shot started with people walking, children skipping, and a horse-drawn omnibus workers trundling up the street. Then, in the blink of an eye, everything changed. Men turned into women, children were replaced by horses, and \u2013 spookiest of all \u2013 the omnibus full of workers changed into a hearse. Because of this, M\u00e9li\u00e8s had found a way to perform actual magic with editing, to fool an audience and pull off illusions he'd never been able to do on stage. This was the birth of trick films.<ref name=\"CrashCourse\"/>\n\nMost of the early films in cinema history consist of continuous shots of short skits and or scenes from everyday life [i.e., [[The Kiss (1896 film)|''The Kiss'']] (1898) or [[L'Arriv\u00e9e d'un train en gare de La Ciotat|''Train Pulling into a Station'']] (1896).] Filmmakers doing trick films attempted to do the impossible on screen; like levitating heads, making people disappear or [[The X-Rays|turning them into skeletons]]. Trick films were silent films designed to feature innovative [[special effects]]. This style of filmmaking was developed by innovators such as Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s and Segundo de Chom\u00f3n in their first cinematic experiments. In the first years of film, especially between 1898 and 1908, the trick film was one of the world's most popular [[film genres]]. Techniques explored in these trick films included [[slow motion]] and [[fast motion]] created by varying the camera cranking speed; the editing device called the [[substitution splice]]; and various [[in-camera effect]]s, such as [[multiple exposure]].<ref>{{citation|last=Parkinson|first=David|title=100 Ideas That Changed Film|location=London|publisher=Laurence King Publishing|year=2012|page=19}} {{verify source |date=September 2019 |reason=This ref was deleted Special:Diff/902524124 by a bug in VisualEditor and later restored by a bot from the original cite located at Special:Permalink/809075346 cite #4 - verify the cite is accurate and delete this template.

Trick films convey energetic whimsy that make impossible events seem to occur on screen. Trick films are in essence films in which artists use camera techniques to create magic tricks or special effects that feel otherworldly. Other examples of trick films include 1901's ''[[The Big Swallow]]'' in which a man tries to swallow the audience, and 1901's ''[[The Haunted Curiosity Shop]]'' in which apparitions appear inside an antiques shop.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nitratediva.wordpress.com/2013/08/09/film-history-for-free-10-entertaining-early-cinema-trick-films/|title=Film History for Free: 10 Entertaining Early Cinema Trick Films|date=9 August 2013|publisher=The Nitrate Diva}}</ref>\n\n=== 1910s ===\n[[File:Charles Ogle In Frankenstein 1910.jpg|thumb|left|180px|In 1910, [[Edison Studios]] produced the [[Frankenstein (1910 film)|first motion picture adaptation]] of [[Mary Shelley]]'s ''[[Frankenstein]]''.]] \nIn 1910, [[Edison Studios]] in the United States produced the first filmed version of [[Mary Shelley]]'s 1818 classic Gothic novel ''[[Frankenstein]]'', the popular story of a scientist creating a hideous, sapient creature through a scientific experiment.

The film tells a story of a student who inadvertently makes a [[Faust|Faustian bargain]]. In the film, a student asks a stranger to turn him into a rich man. The stranger visits the student later in his dorm room and conjures up pieces of gold and a contract for him to sign. In return, the stranger is granted to take anything he wants from the room. He chooses to take the student's mirror. Upon moving it from the wall, a doppelg\u00e4nger steps out and causes trouble. (In Western culture, a doppelg\u00e4nger is a supernatural or ghostly double or look-alike of a specific person. It is usually seen as a harbinger of bad luck.) Cinematographer Guido Seeber utilized groundbreaking camera tricks to create the effect of the [[doppelg\u00e4nger]] by using a mirror double which produces a seamless double exposure. The film was written by [[Hanns Heinz Ewers]], a noted writer of horror and fantasy stories. His involvement with the screenplay lent a much needed air of respectability to the fledgling art form of horror film and German Expressionism<ref>{{Cite book|title= The first German art film: Rye's The Student of Prague (1913)|last= Schl\u00fcpmann |first= Heide |publisher= German Film & Literature, ed.

Wegener teamed up with [[Henrik Galeen]] to create ''[[The Golem (1915 film)|Der Golem]]'' (1915). The film, which is still partially lost, tells a story of an antiques dealer who finds a golem, a clay statue, brought to life centuries before. The dealer resurrects the golem as a servant, but the golem falls in love with the antiques dealer's wife. As she does not return his love, the golem commits a series of murders. Wegener made a sequel to the film two years later.This time he teamed up with co-director [[Rochus Gliese]] and made ''[[The Golem and the Dancing Girl|Der Golem und die T\u00e4nzerin]]'' (1917), or ''The Golem and the Dancing Girl'' as it is known in English. It is now considered a lost film. Wegener would make a third golem film another three years later to conclude his ''Der Golem'' trilogy.\n\nIn 1919, Austrian director [[Richard Oswald]] released a German silent anthology horror film called ''[[Unheimliche Geschichten (1919 film)|Unheimliche Geschichten]]'', also known as ''Eerie Tales'' or ''Uncanny Tales''. In the film, a bookshop closes and the portraits of the [[Prostitution|Strumpet]], [[Death]], and the [[Devil]] come to life and amuse themselves by reading stories\u2014about themselves, of course, in various guises and eras.

It was not so much the story but the style that made it distinguishable from other films, \"''Dr. Caligari'''s settings, some simply painted on canvas backdrops, are weirdly distorted, with caricatures of narrow streets, misshapen walls, odd rhomboid windows, and leaning doorframes.

Writing for the book ''1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die'', horror film critic Kim Newman called ''The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari'' \"a major early entry in the horror genre, introducing images, themes, characters, and expressions that became fundamental to the likes of Tod Browning's ''Dracula'' and James Whales' ''Frankenstein'', both from 1931\".<ref>{{Cite book|title=1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die|last=Schneider|first=Steven Jay|publisher=Octopus Books|year=2011|isbn=|pages=30\u201331}}</ref> ''The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari'' is also a leading example of what a [[German Expressionism|German Expressionist]] film looks like.\n\nIn October 1920, [[Paul Wegener]] teamed up with co-director [[Carl Boese]] to make the final Golem film entitled ''[[The Golem: How He Came into the World|Der Golem, wie er in die Welt kam]]'', known in English as ''The Golem: How He Came into the World''. The final film in the '''Der Golem trilogy''', ''The Golem: How He Came into the World'' (1920) is a prequel to ''[[The Golem (1915 film)|Der Golem]]'' from 1915. In this film, Wegener stars as the golem who frightens a young lady with whom he is infatuated. The film is the best known of the series, as it is the only film that is completely preserved. It is also a leading example of early [[German Expressionism]].\n\n[[F. W. Murnau]] arguably made the first vampire-themed movie, ''[[Nosferatu]]'' (1922). It was an unauthorized adaptation of [[Bram Stoker]]'s gothic horror novel ''[[Dracula]]''. In ''Nosferatu'', Murnau created some of cinema's most lasting and haunting imagery which famously involve shadows of the creeping Count Orlok. This helped popularized the expressionism style in filmmaking. Many expressionist works of this era emphasize a distorted reality, stimulating the human psyche and have influenced the horror film genre.\n[[File:Untitled (Cesare -Conrad Veidt- Carrying Jane -Lil Dagover- across Rooftops) LACMA M.82.287.1e.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The visual style of German Expressionist films included deliberately distorted forms and shadows as seen here in ''[[The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari]]'']]\n\nFor most of the 1920s, German filmmakers like Wegener, Murnau, and Wiene would significantly influence later productions not only in horror films but in filmmaking in general. They would become the leading innovators of the '''[[German Expressionism|German Expressionist]]''' movement. The plots and stories of the German Expressionist films often dealt with madness and insanity. [[Arthur Robison]]'s film, ''[[Schatten \u2013 Eine n\u00e4chtliche Halluzination]]'' (1923), literally ''Shadows \u2013 a Nocturnal Hallucination'', also known as ''Warning Shadows'' in English, is also one of the leading German Expressionist films. It tells the story of house guests inside a manor given visions of what might happen if the manor's host, the count played by [[Fritz Kortner]], stays jealous and the guests do not reduce their advances towards his beautiful wife. Kortner's bulging eyes and twisted features are facets of a classic Expressionist performance style, as his unnatural feelings contort his face and body into something that appears other than human.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bfi.org.uk/news-opinion/news-bfi/lists/10-great-german-expressionist-films|title=10 great German Expressionist films|date=8 June 2018|publisher=[[BFI]]}}</ref>\n\nIn 1924, German filmmaker [[Paul Leni]] made another representative German Expressionist film with ''[[Waxworks (film)|Das Wachsfigurenkabinett]]'', or ''Waxworks'' as it is commonly known. The horror film tells a story of a writer who accepts a job from a wax museum to write a series of stories on different controversial figures including [[Ivan the Terrible]] and [[Jack the Ripper]] in order to boost business. Although ''Waxworks'' is often credited as a horror film, it is an [[anthology film]] that goes through several genres including a fantasy adventure, historical film, and horror film through its various episodes. ''Waxworks'' contain many elements present in a German Expressionist movie. The film features deep shadows, moving shapes, and warped staircases. The director said of the film, \"I have tried to create sets so stylized that they evidence no idea of reality.\" ''Waxworks'' was director [[Paul Leni]]\u2019s last film in Germany before heading to Hollywood to make some of the most important horror films of the late silent era.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://filmdirtblog.blogspot.com/2016/04/waxworks-1924-paul-lenis-early-horror.html|title=Waxworks (1924): Paul Leni's Early Horror Anthology Film Is Big on Style|date=26 April 2016|publisher=[[Film Dirt]]}}</ref>\n\nAccording to ''Wisecrack'''s episode on ''How Horror Movies Changed'', \"the horror genre blossoms anywhere there was pain and national chaos. So it's more than fitting that the genre's real boom took place in the mega-depressing [[Post\u2013World War I recession|Post-World War I Germany]]. During the war (1914\u20131918), Germany banned all foreign films, inadvertently throwing all film nerds a boom.

This would retroactively become the first phase of the studio's [[Universal Classic Monsters]] series that would continue for three more decades. Universal Pictures' classic monsters of the 1920s featured hideously deformed characters like [[Quasimodo]], [[Erik (The Phantom of the Opera)|The Phantom]], and [[The Man Who Laughs|Gwynplaine]].\n\nThe first film of the series was ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1923 film)|The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]'' (1923) starring [[Lon Chaney]] as the hunchback [[Quasimodo]]. The film was adapted from the classic French gothic novel [[The Hunchback of Notre-Dame|of the same name]] written by [[Victor Hugo]] in 1833, about a horribly deformed bell ringer in the cathedral of Notre-Dame. The film elevated Chaney, already a well-known character actor, to full star status in Hollywood, and also helped set a standard for many later horror films.\n\nTwo years later, Chaney stars as [[Erik (The Phantom of the Opera)|The Phantom]] who haunts the Paris Opera House in 1925's silent horror film, ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1925 film)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'', based on the mystery novel by [[Gaston Leroux]] published 15 years earlier.

It was a sound remake of the studio's earlier film, ''[[The Cat and the Canary (1927 film)|The Cat and the Canary]]'' from three years ago. Simultaneously, Universal also released a Spanish-speaking version of the film called ''[[La Voluntad del muerto|La Voluntad del Muerto]]'' ''(The Will of the Dead Man)''. The film was directed by [[George Melford]] who would later direct the Spanish version of ''Dracula''.

The film was based on the [[Dracula (1924 play)|1924 stage play]] by [[Hamilton Deane]] and [[John L.

The story is about a scientist and his assistant who dig up corpses in the hopes to reanimated them with electricity. The experiment goes awry when Dr. Frankenstein's assistant accidentally gives the creature a murderer's abnormal brain. 1931's ''Frankenstein'' was based on a [[Peggy Webling|1927 play]] by [[Peggy Webling]] which in turn was based off [[Mary Shelley]]\u2019s classic [[Frankenstein|1818 Gothic novel]]. The film was directed by [[James Whale]] and stars [[Boris Karloff]] as Frankenstein\u2019s monster in one of his most iconic roles. A hit with both audiences and critics, the film was followed by multiple sequels and along with the same year\u2019s ''[[Dracula (1931 English-language film)|Dracula]]'', has become one of the most famous horror films in history. \u201cUniversal\u2019s makeup genius [[Jack Pierce (makeup artist)|Jack Pierce]] created the main look of the monster, devising the flattop, the neck terminals, the heavy eyelids, and the elongated scarred hands, while director James Whale outfitted the creature with a shabby suit.\u201d<ref>{{Cite book|title=1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die|last=Schneider|first= Steven Jay|year=2011|isbn=|page=88}}</ref>\n\nOn February 21, 1932, Universal Pictures released a double-feature. The first one is ''[[Murders in the Rue Morgue (1932 film)|Murders in the Rue Morgue]]''. It stars [[Bela Lugosi]] as a lunatic scientist who abducts women and injects them with blood from his ill-tempered caged ape. The film was loosely based on an [[The Murders in the Rue Morgue|1841 short story]] by [[Edgar Allan Poe]]. Universal Pictures would release two more Poe adaptations later in the decade. The second film in the double-feature is the [[James Whale]]-directed ''[[The Old Dark House (1932 film)|The Old Dark House]]''. It's a mystery horror story starring [[Boris Karloff]]. Five travelers are admitted to a large foreboding old house that belongs to an extremely strange family. The story was based on a 1927 novel by [[J.B. Priestly]].\n\nOn December 1932, the studio released ''[[The Mummy (1932 film)|The Mummy]]'' starring [[Boris Karloff]] as the Egyptian monster. The film, based on an original screenplay, is about an ancient Egyptian [[mummy]] named Imhotep who is discovered by a team of archaeologists and inadvertently brought back to life through a magic scroll. Review aggregator website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reports a 93% score, based on 27 reviews, with an average rating of 7.9/10. The site's consensus states: \"Relying more on mood and atmosphere than the thrills typical of modern horror fare, Universal's The Mummy sets a masterful template for mummy-themed films to follow.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1014370_mummy |title=The Mummy |website= Rotten Tomatoes}}</ref>  The Mummy character was so popular that it spawned sequels and remakes over the next decades.\n\nMake-up artist [[Jack Pierce (makeup artist)|Jack Pierce]] was responsible for the look of the Mummy.

The first one was in July. It was a murder-mystery film called ''[[The Secret of the Blue Room]]''. The plot of the film is that, according to legend, the \"blue room\" inside a mansion is cursed. Everyone who has ever spent the night there has met with an untimely end. Three men wager that each can survive a night in the forbidding room.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://letterboxd.com/film/secret-of-the-blue-room/ |title=Secret of the Blue Room. 1933. Directed by Kurt Neumann. |publisher=Letterboxd }}</ref> In November, the studio premiered another iconic character with [[Griffin (The Invisible Man)|Dr. Jack Griffin]], aka the Invisible Man in the classic science fiction-horror ''[[The Invisible Man (1933 film)|The Invisible Man]]''. The film was directed by [[James Whale]] and stars [[Claude Rains]] as the titular character. The movie was based on a science fiction novel [[The Invisible Man|of the same name]] by [[H. G. Wells]] published in 1897. The film has been described as a \"nearly perfect translation of the spirit of the book\".<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Science of Fiction and the Fiction of Science: Collected Essays on SF Storytelling and the Gnostic Imagination|last=McFarland|year=2009|isbn=|page=41}}</ref> It spawned a number of sequels, plus many spinoffs using the idea of an \"invisible man\" that were largely unrelated to Wells' original story.\n\n''The Invisible Man'' is known for its clever and groundbreaking visual effects by [[John P.

Claude Rains was claustrophobic and it was hard to breathe through the suit. Consequently, the work was especially difficult for him, and a double, who was somewhat shorter than Rains, was sometimes used.\n\nIn 1934, Universal Pictures released the successful psychological horror film ''[[The Black Cat (1934 film)|The Black Cat]]''. It stars both [[Boris Karloff]] and [[Bela Lugosi]]. It was the first of six movies Universal Pictures paired the two iconic actors together. ''The Black Cat'' became Universal Pictures' biggest box office hit of the year and is considered by many to be the one that created and popularized the psychological horror subgenre, emphasizing on atmosphere, eerie sounds, the darker side of the human psyche, and emotions like fear and guilt to deliver its scares, something that was not used in the horror genre before. Although it was credited the film was based om [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s classic 1841 [[The Black Cat (short story)|short story]], the film actually has little to do with Poe's story. In the film, \nAmerican honeymooners in Hungary become trapped in the home of a Satan-worshiping priest when the bride is taken there for medical help following a road accident.

The first picture they released in 1935 was ''[[The Mystery of Edwin Drood (1935 film)|The Mystery of Edwin Drood]]'', a mystery drama film starring [[Claude Rains]]. The story revolves around an opium-addicted choirmaster who develops an obsession for a beautiful young girl and will not stop short of murder in order to have her. The film was based on the final novel by [[Charles Dickens]] in 1870.\n\nIn April 1935, ''[[Bride of Frankenstein]]'' premiered. The science-fiction/horror film was the first sequel to the 1931 hit ''[[Frankenstein (1931 film)|Frankenstein]]''. It is widely regarded as one of the greatest sequels in cinematic history, with many fans and critics considering it to be an improvement on the original film. As with the original, ''Bride of Frankenstein'' was directed by [[James Whale]] and stars [[Boris Karloff]] as the Monster. In the film, Dr. Frankenstein, goaded by an even madder scientist, builds his monster a mate, often referred to as [[Bride of Frankenstein (character)|the Monster's Bride]]. Makeup artist [[Jack Pierce (makeup artist)|Jack Pierce]] returned to create the makeup for the Monster and his Bride.

The film stars [[Henry Hull]] as the titular character. In the movie, he is a botanist who gets attacked by a strange animal. The bite causes him to turn into a bloodthirsty monster. [[Jack Pierce (makeup artist)|Jack Pierce]] created the make-up for the creature. Screenwriter and journalist [[Frank Nugent]], writing for ''[[The New York Times]]'', thought the film was \"designed solely to amaze and horrify.\" He continued by writing, \"''Werewolf of London'' goes about its task with commendable thoroughness, sparing no grisly detail and springing from scene to scene with even greater ease than that oft attributed to a daring young aerialist.

The film was ''[[The Raven (1935 film)|The Raven]]''. The film was not actually a direct adaptation of the [[The Raven|classic 1845 poem]], but rather inspired from it. In the film, a brilliant surgeon, played by Bela Lugosi, is obsessed with the writer [[Edgar Allan Poe]]. He saves the life of a beautiful dancer but goes mad when he can't have her. Meanwhile, Boris Karloff plays a fugitive murderer on the run from the police. 1935's ''The Raven'' contains themes of torture, disfigurement, and grisly revenge. The film did not do particularly well at the box office during its initial release, and indirectly led to a temporary ban on horror films in England. At the time, it was beginning to look like the horror genre was no longer economically viable, and paired with the strict [[Motion Picture Production Code|production code]] of the era, American filmmakers struggled to make creative works on screen, and horror eventually went out of vogue. This proved a devastating development at the time for Lugosi, who found himself losing work and struggling to support his family. Universal Pictures changed ownership in 1936, and the new management was less interested in the macabre.\n\nIn 1936, Universal Pictures continued to make films for the series. In January, the studio premiered the science fiction melodrama ''[[The Invisible Ray (1936 film)|The Invisible Ray]]''. The film pairs [[Bela Lugosi]] and [[Boris Karloff]] a third time. In the film, a scientist creates a telescope-like device that captures light waves from the Andromeda Galaxy, giving him a way to view the distant past. He and several colleagues go to Africa to locate a large, unusual meteorite that the light-waves showed fell there a billion years earlier. After discovering that the meteorite is composed of a poisonous unknown element, \"Radium X\", he begins to glow in the dark, and his touch becomes deadly. These radiation effects also begin to slowly drive him mad. Critics noted the tone of the film to be somber, dignified, and tragic. ''The Invisible Ray'' is a morality play, particularly given the film's final lines of dialog, uttered nine years before the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|events of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]], by Madame Rukh: \"My son, you have broken the first law of science...Janos Rukh is dead, but part of him will go on to eternity, working for humanity\".\n\nIn May 1936, Universal Pictures released a sequel to 1931's ''Dracula''. The film was called ''[[Dracula's Daughter]]'' and stars [[Gloria Holden]] in the title role. ''Dracula's Daughter'' doesn't feature [[Bela Lugosi]] or his character, but instead tells the story of Countess Marya Zaleska, the daughter of Count Dracula and herself a vampire. Following Dracula's death, she believes that by destroying his body she will be free of his influence and live normally. When this fails, she turns to a psychiatrist, played by [[Otto Kruger]]. He, in turn, has a fianc\u00e9, Janet. The Countess kidnaps Janet and takes her to Transylvania, leading to a battle between Dr. Garth and the Countess. While not as successful as the original upon its release, the film was generally well-reviewed. In the intervening decades, criticism has been deeply divided. Contemporary critics and scholars have noted the film's strong lesbian overtones, which Universal acknowledged from the start of production and exploited in some early advertising. Universal would completed their initial ''Dracula'' trilogy seven years later with ''[[Son of Dracula (1943 film)|Son of Dracula]]''.\n[[File:GloriaHolden2DraculasDaughterTrailerScreenshot1936.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[Gloria Holden]] as the Countess in ''[[Dracula's Daughter]]'']]\n\nIn 1937, Universal Pictures only released one film in the series. The film was ''[[Night Key]]'', a science fiction crime thriller starring [[Boris Karloff]]. In ''Night Key'', Karloff plays an elderly inventor of a burglar alarm who attempts to get back at the man who stole the profits to his invention. Later, his device is then subverted by gangsters who threatens him and use his own device to facilitate burglaries. Letterboxd users call the film \"a delightfully corny, old-fashioned thriller\". and praised the film for Karloff's performance.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://letterboxd.com/film/night-key/|title= Night Key (1937) Letterboxd Reviews |publisher=Letterboxd }}</ref>\n\nIn 1938, Universal Pictures did not release any film related to horror, thriller, or science fiction. Instead, they made re-releases of their previous ''Dracula'' and ''Frankenstein'' films. It was only on January 1939, a full year and a half after the release of ''Night Key'' that the studio continued putting out original horror movies. In January 7, 1939, Universal Pictures premiered their 12-part serial ''[[The Phantom Creeps]]''. It stars [[Bela Lugosi]] as a mad scientist who attempts to rule the world by creating various elaborate inventions. In a dramatic fashion, foreign agents and [[G-Man (slang)|G-Men]] (government men) try to seize the inventions for themselves. A 78-minute feature film version of the film, cut down from the serial's original 265 minutes, was released for television ten years later. ''The Phantom Creeps'' was Universal Pictures' 112th serial and 44th to have sound. The innovation of the scrolling text version of the synopsis at the beginning of each chapter was used for the ''[[Star Wars]]'' films as the \"Star Wars opening crawl\".\n\nIn January 13, 1939, Universal Pictures released ''[[Son of Frankenstein]]'', the third entry in the studio's ''Frankenstein'' series and the last to feature [[Boris Karloff]] as the Monster. It is also the first to feature [[Bela Lugosi]] as Ygor. The film is the sequel to James Whale's ''[[Bride of Frankenstein]]'', and stars top-billed [[Basil Rathbone]], Karloff, Lugosi and [[Lionel Atwill]]. ''Son of Frankenstein'' was a reaction to the popular re-releases of ''Dracula'' and ''Frankenstein'' as double-features in 1938. In the film, one of the sons of Frankenstein finds his father's monster in a coma and revives him, only to find out he is controlled by Ygor who is bent on revenge. Universal's declining horror output was revitalized with the enormously successful ''Son of Frankenstein'', in which the studio cast both stars (Lugosi and Karloff) again for the fourth time.\n\nIn November 1939, Universal Pictures released their last horror film of the 1930s with the historical and quasi-horror film, ''[[Tower of London (1939 film)|Tower of London]]''. It stars [[Basil Rathbone]] as the future [[Richard III of England|King Richard III of England]], and [[Boris Karloff]] as his fictitious club-footed executioner Mord. [[Vincent Price]], in only his third film, appears as [[George Plantagenet, 1st Duke of Clarence|George, Duke of Clarence.]] ''Tower of London'' is based on the traditional depiction of Richard rising to become King of England in 1483 by eliminating everyone ahead of him. Each time Richard accomplishes a murder, he removes one figurine from a dollhouse resembling a throne room. Once he has completed his task, he now needs to defeat the exiled [[Henry VII of England|Henry Tudor]] to retain the throne.\n\n====Other productions====\nOther studios followed Universal's lead. [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]]'s controversial ''[[Freaks (1932 film)|Freaks]]'' (1932) frightened audiences at the time, featuring characters played by people who had real deformities,. The studio even disowned the film, and it remained banned in the United Kingdom, for 30 years.<ref>Derek Malcolm [https://www.theguardian.com/film/1999/apr/15/derekmalcolmscenturyoffilm.derekmalcolm \"Tod Browning: Freaks\"], ''The Guardian'', 15 April 1999; ''A Century of Films'', London: IB Tauris, 2000, p.66-67.</ref> [[Paramount Pictures]]' ''[[Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1931 film)|Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde]]'' (1931) is remembered for its innovative use of photographic filters to create Jekyll's transformation before the camera.<ref>David J. Skal, ''The Monster Show: a Cultural History of Horror'', New York: Faber, p.142.</ref> And [[RKO]] created the highly successful and influential monster movie, ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]'' (1933). With the progression of the genre, actors like Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi were beginning to build entire careers in horror.\n\nEarly in the decade also, Danish director [[Carl Theodor Dreyer]] created the horror fantasy film ''[[Vampyr]]'' (1932) based on elements from [[J. Sheridan Le Fanu]]'s collection of supernatural stories ''[[In a Glass Darkly]]''. The German-produced sound film tells the story of Allan Gray, a student of the occult who enters a village under the curse of a vampire. According to the book [[1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die]], ''Vampyr'''s \"greatness derives partly from Dreyer's handling of the vampire theme in terms of sexuality and eroticism, and partly from its highly distinctive, dreamy look.\"\n\n=== 1940s ===\nIn the 1940s, [[Val Lewton]] became a well known figure in early B-horror cinema for making low-budget movies for [[RKO Pictures]], including ''[[Cat People (1942 film)|Cat People]]'' (1942), ''[[I Walked with a Zombie]]'' (1943), ''[[The Leopard Man]]'' (1943) directed by [[Jacques Tourneur]], [[The Curse of the Cat People|''Curse of the Cat'' ''People'']] and ''[[The Body Snatcher (film)|The Body Snatcher]]'' (1945) directed by Robert Wise, a film deemed by the United States' [[National Film Registry]]  as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n\nThe decade also sees the continuation of [[Universal Pictures]]' consistent releases of horror, suspense and science fiction films. This comes to be later known as the cult classic [[Universal Classic Monsters]] series which began in the 1920s and would later dissipate in the 1950s. In this decade [[Lon Chaney Jr.]] became the studio's leading monster movie actor supplanting the previous decades' leading stars Karloff and Lugosi by a wide margin in terms of the number of leading roles that he played. Chaney is best known playing [[Larry Talbot]] in ''[[The Wolf Man (1941 film)|The Wolf Man]]'' (1941) and its sequels and crossover films. He also played Frankenstein's monster in ''[[The Ghost of Frankenstein]]'' (1942), taking over Boris Karloff in the main role. The ''Mummy'' series was also continued with ''[[The Mummy's Tomb]]'' (1942), ''[[The Mummy's Ghost]]'' and ''[[The Mummy's Curse]]'' (both 1944) all starring Chaney Jr. as the Mummy.\n\nParamount Pictures also made horror films in the 1940s, the most popular of which is ''[[The Uninvited (1944 film)|The Uninvited]]''. The film has been noted by contemporary film scholars as being the first film in history to portray ghosts as legitimate entities rather than illusions or misunderstandings played for comedy. It depicts various supernatural phenomena, including disembodied voices, apparitions, and possession. [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]]'s best horror genre contribution of the 1940s would be [[Albert Lewin]]'s ''[[The Picture of Dorian Gray (1945 film)|The Picture of Dorian Gray]]'', which was popularly known for its interesting use of color insert to show Dorian's haunting portrait.\n\nIn 1945, Great Britain contributed the anthology horror film ''[[Dead of Night]]''. In the film house guests tell at least five supernatural tales, the last of which being the most remembered. The film's last story, titled ''The Ventriloquist's Dummy'' features a ventriloquist tormented by a malevolent puppet.\n\nThe popularity of movie genres of the 1940s were mostly [[film noir]], [[melodrama]] and [[Mystery film|mystery]]. It would then arguably be a stretch to point out that some mystery and thriller films can be considered horror genre contributions of the decade. These movies include ''[[The Spiral Staircase (1946 film)|The Spiral Staircase]]'' (1946) which tells the story of a serial killer targeting women with \"afflictions\", like the mute and blind; ''[[The Seventh Victim]]'' (1943), a horror/film noir story of a woman stumbling upon a Satanic cult while looking for her missing sister; and [[John Brahm]]'s ''[[The Lodger (1944 film)|The Lodger]]'' (1944), where a landlady suspects her new lodger to be [[Jack the Ripper]].\n\n''[[The Queen of Spades (1949 film)|The Queen of Spades]]'' (1949) is a fantasy/horror film about an elderly countess who strikes a bargain with the devil and exchanges her soul for the ability to always win at cards. [[Wes Anderson]] ranked it as the sixth best British film.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.timeout.com/london/feature/842/100bbf-contributors-directors#wesanderson|title=100 Best British Films: Directors|accessdate=2012-10-14|publisher=timeout.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121221083512/http://www.timeout.com/london/feature/842/100bbf-contributors-directors#wesanderson|archive-date=21 December 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> [[Martin Scorsese]] said that ''The Queen of Spades'' is a \"stunning film\" and one of \"the few true classics of supernatural cinema.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://infoweb.newsbank.com/resources/doc/nb/news/12F8EB7A100643B0?p=UKNB |title= Tale of luckless director dealt bad hand|newspaper=The Sunday Herald}}</ref> And Dennis Schwartz of Ozus' World Movie Reviews called it \"A masterfully filmed surreal atmospheric supernatural tale\".<ref name=\"schwartz14\">{{cite web |last1=Schwartz |first1=Dennis |title=queenofspades |url=http://homepages.sover.net/~ozus/queenofspades.html |website=Sover.net |publisher=Dennis Schwartz |accessdate=22 August 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== 1950s ===\nWith advances in technology, the tone of horror films shifted from the Gothic towards contemporary concerns. A popular horror subgenre began to emerge: the [[Doomsday film]].<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">Charles Derry, ''Dark Dreams: A Psychological History of the Modern Horror Film''; A S Barnes & Co, 1977.</ref> Low-budget productions featured humanity overcoming threats such as [[alien invasion]]s and deadly [[mutation]]s to people, plants, and insects. Popular films of this genre include ''[[Creature from the Black Lagoon]]'' (1954) and ''[[The Blob]]'' (1958).\n\n1956's science fiction/horror film ''[[Invasion of the Body Snatchers]]'' concerns an extraterrestrial invasion where aliens are capable of reproducing a duplicate replacement copy of each human. It is considered to be the most popular and most paranoid films from the golden age of American sci-fi cinema.\n\nIn the 1950s, television had arrived and the theatrical market was changing. Producers and exhibitors found new, exciting and enticing ways to keep audiences in theaters. This is how Hollywood directors and producers found ample opportunity for audience exploitation through gimmicks. The years 1952 through 1954 is considered the \"Golden Era\" of 3-D movies. In a [[3D film|three-dimensional stereoscopic film]], the audience's brains are tricked into believing the images projected onto a flat cinema screen are coming to life in full three-dimensional glory.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.physics.org/article-questions.asp?id=56|title= How do 3D films work?|publisher=physics.org|date=2010-01-07}}</ref>  Through this way, the audience's fright factor is enhanced. Those who came to see a 3-D movie inside a theater were given the familiar disposable cardboard [[anaglyph 3D]] glasses to wear which will allow them to see the images come to life.\n\n[[File:Vincent Price in House on Haunted Hill.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Vincent Price]] in ''[[House on Haunted Hill]]'']]\nIn April 1953, Warner Bros. presented the horror-thriller ''[[House of Wax (1953 film)|House of Wax]]'', the first 3D feature with stereophonic sound. The film, which stars [[Vincent Price]], tells a story of a disfigured sculptor who repopulates his destroyed wax museum by murdering people and using their wax-coated corpses as displays. ''House of Wax'' was the film that typecast Price as a horror icon. A year later, he played a trademark role as a round-the-bend illusionist bent on revenge in the 3D film noir/horror ''[[The Mad Magician]]'' (1954). After the release of that film, Price would be labeled the \"King of 3-D\" and would later become the actor to star in the most 3D features. The success of these two films proved that major studios now had a method of getting film-goers back into theaters and away from television sets, which were causing a steady decline in attendance.\n\nAside from 3-D technology, different forms of promotional gimmicks were used to entice film-goers into seeing the films in theaters. One great example is during the screening of 1958's ''[[The Lost Missile]]'', a science fiction film in which scientists try to stop a mysterious missile from destroying the Earth. Audiences who saw the film in theaters were given \"shock tags\" to monitor their vitals during the movie. They were promised that anyone who would get shocked into a comatose state by the film would get a free ride home in a limousine.<ref name=\"ballyhoo\">{{cite book | title=Beyond Ballyhoo: Motion Picture Promotion and Gimmicks | first=Mark Thomas | last=McGee | publisher=McFarland & Co | year=2001 | isbn=0-7864-1114-7 | page=120 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Bg6b5FKd_HkC&pg=PA120&dq=smell-o-rama&q=smell-o-rama}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Percepto.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[The Tingler]]'', 1959: \"Can You Take Percepto?\"]]\nFilm director and producer [[William Castle]] is considered the King of the film gimmick. After directing a cavalcade of [[B movies]] (low-budget commercial films) for Columbia Pictures in the 1940s, Castle set out on the independent route. And to help sell his first self-financed film ''[[Macabre (1958 film)|Macabre]]'' (1958), he not only hired girls to stand in as fake nurses outside theater doors just in case anyone needed medical attention, he also passed out a certificate for a $1,000 life insurance policy to each member of the audience in case anyone would happen to die of fright from watching his film. This kind of promotional gimmick would later make him famous.<ref>{{cite book|last=Merritt|first=Greg|title=Celluloid Mavericks: The History of American Independent Film|page=[https://archive.org/details/celluloidmaveric00merr/page/148 148]|year=2000|publisher=Thunder's Mouth Press|isbn=978-1-56025-232-0|url=https://archive.org/details/celluloidmaveric00merr/page/148}}</ref> Other gimmicks Castle utilized in his films include ''EMERGO'' which was used during the screening of his 1959 classic ''[[House on Haunted Hill]]'' starring [[Vincent Price]]. Throughout the promotion of this film, Castle explained that through EMERGO, \u201cghosts and skeletons leave the screen and wander throughout the audience, roam around and go back to the screen\u201d. Of course, in actuality, a skeleton with glowing red eyes was attached to wires above the theater in order to swoop in and float above audience members' heads to parallel the action on the screen.<ref name=\"The Royal Ocean Film Society\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DJ-e7HfB5k|title= Smell-O-Vision, and Other Glorious Gimmicks|date=28 May 2019|publisher=The Royal Ocean Film Society}}</ref> Another Castle/Price production was ''[[The Tingler]]'' (1959) which tells the story of a scientist who discovers a parasite in human beings, called a \"tingler\", which feeds on fear. In the film, Price breaks the fourth wall and warns the audience that the tingler is in the theater which then prompts the built-in [[The Tingler#Percepto: \"Scream for your lives!\"|electric buzzers]] to scare audiences in their theater seats.\n\nThe 1950s is also well known for [[Monster movie|creature feature]] or giant monster movies. These are usually [[disaster film]]s that focuses on a group of characters struggling to survive attacks by one or more antagonistic monsters, often abnormally large ones. The monster is often created by a folly of mankind \u2013 an experiment gone wrong, the effects of radiation or the destruction of habitat. The monster can also be from outer space, or has been on Earth for a long time with no one ever seeing it, or released (or awakened) from a prison of some sort where it was being held. In monster movies, the monster is usually a villain, but can be a metaphor of humankind's continuous destruction. Warner Bros.' ''[[The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms]]'' (1953) is considered to be the film which kick-started the 1950s wave of monster movies and the concept of combining nuclear paranoia with the genre.<ref>{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Stephen|title= The Illustrated Dinosaur Movie Guide|year=1995|publisher=London: Titan Books|isbn=1-85286-487-7}}</ref> In the film, a beast was awakened from its hibernating state in the frozen ice of the Arctic Circle by an atomic bomb test. It then begins to wreak a path of destruction as it travels southward, eventually arriving at its ancient spawning grounds, which includes New York City. ''The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms'' was the first ever live-action film to feature a giant monster awakened/brought about by an atomic bomb detonation, preceding ''[[Godzilla]]'' by 16 months. The film is also remembered for its influential [[stop motion]] [[model animation]] created by visual effects creator [[Ray Harryhausen]]. One of the best movies during these years was ''[[Night of the Demon]]'' (1957).\n\n[[Ray Harryhausen]] created his own form of stop motion model animation called ''Dynamation''. It involved photographing a miniature against a rear-projection screen through a partly masked pane of glass. The masked portion would then be re-exposed to insert foreground elements from the live footage. The effect was to make the creature appear to move in the midst of live action. It could now be seen walking behind a live tree, or be viewed in the middle distance over the shoulder of a live actor \u2014 effects difficult to achieve before.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/08/movies/ray-harryhausen-cinematic-special-effects-innovator-dies-at-92.html |title=Ray Harryhausen, Whose Creatures Battled Jason and Sinbad, Dies at 92 |accessdate= May 7, 2013|work=The New York Times}}</ref> Harryhausen's innovative style of special effects in films inspired numerous filmmakers including future fantasy and horror directors [[Peter Jackson]], [[Tim Burton]], and [[Guillermo del Toro]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bfi.org.uk/news-opinion/sight-sound-magazine/comment/obituaries/mighty-ray-harryhausen |title= Mighty Ray Harryhausen: The monster movie maestro who remodelled Hollywood |date= November 30, 2016|work=bfi.org.uk}}</ref> In the 1963 fantasy film ''[[Jason and the Argonauts (1963 film)|Jason and the Argonauts]]'', there is an iconic fight scene that involves skeleton warriors.

Japan's [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|experience with Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] bore the well-known ''[[Godzilla (1954 film)|Godzilla]]'' (1954) and [[Godzilla (franchise)|its many sequels]], featuring mutation from the [[Effects of nuclear explosions|effects of nuclear radiation]]. This kickstarted the tokusatsu trend known as [[Kaiju|Kaiju films]], a Japanese film genre that features giant monsters, usually attacking major cities and engaging the military and other monsters in battle. Other films in this genre that isn't about Godzilla include ''[[Rodan (film)|Rodan]]'' (1956) and ''[[The Mysterians]]'' (1957). Besides Kaiju films, Japan was also into ghost cat/feline ghost movies in the 1950s. These include ''[[Ghost-Cat of Gojusan-Tsugi]]'' (1956), and ''[[Black Cat Mansion]]'' (1958), which tells a story of a samurai tormented by a cat possessed by the spirits of the people she killed.\n\nFilmmakers continued to merge elements of science fiction and horror over the following decades. ''[[The Fly (1958 film)|The Fly]]'' is a 1958 American science fiction-horror film starring [[Vincent Price]]. The film tells the story of a scientist who is transformed into a grotesque creature after a common house fly enters unseen into a molecular transporter he is experimenting with, resulting in his atoms being combined with those of the insect, which produces a human-fly hybrid. The film was released in [[CinemaScope]] with Color by Deluxe by 20th Century Fox. It was followed by two black-and-white sequels, ''[[Return of the Fly]]'' (1959) and ''[[Curse of the Fly]]'' (1965). The original film was remade in 1986 by director [[David Cronenberg]].\n\n[[File:Attackofthe50ftwoman.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Poster art for the 1958 sci-fi horror [[Attack of the 50 Foot Woman]]]]\nConsidered a \"pulp masterpiece\"<ref>Geoff Andrew, \"''The Incredible Shrinking Man''\", in John Pym (ed.)

The storyline concerns the plight of a wealthy heiress whose close encounter with an enormous alien causes her to grow into a giantess, complicating her marriage already troubled by a philandering husband.

His film ''[[Black Sunday (1960 film)|La Maschera del Demonio]]'' (1960), marketed in English as ''The Mask of Satan'' then wound up being known as ''Black Sunday'' in the United States and ''Revenge of the Vampire'' in the United Kingdom. In this film, Bava turned a Russian folk legend into a beguiling fairly tale about a young doctor who finds himself stranded in a haunted community and falls for a woman whose body become possessed by a woman executed for witchcraft. Three years later, Bava went on to make the horror anthology film ''[[Black Sabbath (film)|Black Sabbath]]'' (1963) known in Italy as ''I tre volti della paura'', literally 'The Three Faces of Fear'.\n\nIn the United States, gimmicks continued to be used to entice film-goers into theaters.

They will need to search the house to find the doctor's fortune, but along with the property they have also inherited the occultist's collection of thirteen ghosts. In 1961, Castle made ''[[Mr. Sardonicus]]''. It tells the story of a man whose face becomes frozen in a horrifying grin while robbing his father's grave to obtain a winning lottery ticket. During the promotion of the film, Castle introduced the \u201cpunishment poll\u201d where the audiences decide what happens to Mr. Sardonicus in the film. All they had to do was hold up a \u201cthumbs up\u201d ballot if they wanted Mr. Sardonicus go free or \"thumbs down\" if they want to punish him. Supposedly no audience ever voted for life over death, so the film continues as if the audience's majority verdict was seriously counted.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Punishment Poll from Mr. Sardonicus|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJjK9njAwu0|website=YouTube|accessdate=May 27, 2007}}</ref> Also in the same year, William Castle made ''[[Homicidal]]'', which follows a murderous woman in a small California town.

His success in ''[[House of Usher (film)|House of Usher]]'' (1960) led him to do other Poe adaptions like \n''[[Tales of Terror]]'' (1962) and ''[[The Masque of the Red Death (1964 film)|The Masque of the Red Death]]'' (1964). Other popular [[Vincent Price]] horror films include ''[[House on Haunted Hill]]'' (1959), ''[[The Comedy of Terrors]]'' (1963), ''[[War-Gods of the Deep]]'' (1965) and ''[[The Last Man on Earth (1964 film)|The Last Man on Earth]]'' (1964)  where Price becomes a reluctant Vampire hunter after becoming the last man on earth.\n\nThe British horror film ''[[The Haunting (1963 film)|The Haunting]]'' (1963) was directed and produced by [[Robert Wise]]. It is an adaptation of the 1959 horror novel ''[[The Haunting of Hill House]]'' by famed horror writer [[Shirley Jackson]]. Robert Wise's ''The Haunting'' is considered by a great many critics, aficionados, and casual fans of the horror genre to be one of the scariest films of all time. The film is best known for its brilliant use of canted frames, mirror reflections, fish-eye lenses and uncanny sound and image editing.\n\n[[Roman Polanski]] made his first film in English with ''[[Repulsion (film)|Repulsion]]'' (1965), which is considered to be his scariest and most disturbing work.

Distancing the era from earlier gothic trends, late 1960s films brought horror into everyday life.\n\nLow-budget [[splatter film]]s from the likes of [[Herschell Gordon Lewis]] also gained prominence in the 1960s.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Wilson|first1=Karina|title=Horror Movies In The 1960s: Bad Girls And Blood Freaks|url=http://www.horrorfilmhistory.com/index.php?pageID=1960s|website=Horror Film History|accessdate=14 October 2017}}</ref> It's the precursor to \"torture porn\" movies that would become popular in the following decades. Some of Lewis' notorious works include ''[[Two Thousand Maniacs!]]'' (1964) which follows a group of Northern tourists savagely tortured and murdered during a Confederate celebration of a small southern community's centennial; and ''[[Color Me Blood Red]]'' (1965), a story about a psychotic painter who murders civilians and uses their blood as red paint.\n\nIn television, the animated mystery [[Hanna-Barbera]] series ''[[Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!]]'' was broadcast from 1969 to 1970. The series centers on a group of teenagers and their dog who go to abandoned places to solve mysteries involving supposedly supernatural creatures through a series of antics and missteps. The animated series' simple formula had a major impact on future [[slasher films]] especially of its portrayal of villains in masks.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://bloody-disgusting.com/editorials/3435783/influence-scooby-doo-modern-slasher-film/|title=The Influence of \"Scooby Doo\" On the Slasher Film|publisher=Bloody Disgusting}}</ref>\n\n=== 1970s\u20131980s ===\n[[File:Suspiria 1977.jpg|thumb|240px|Suzy ([[Jessica Harper]], right) and Sara ([[Stefania Casini]], left) in ''[[Suspiria]]'', an Italian [[supernatural horror]] film.]]\nThe 1970s began a new age for horror films with the transition from \"classic\" to modern horror. Horror films started to focus more on aggressiveness and ruthlessness while also focusing more on artistic qualities and societal themes.<ref>{{Cite book|title=American horrors : essays on the modern American horror film|others=Waller, Gregory A.

Unlike the past, which was influenced heavily by European film-makers, Americans breathed a new life into the genre. Modern horror films took the expected roles of characters in the films and changed them.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThis era changed the usual setting for horror films, using every-day settings. Along with this came a change from focusing on defeating evil every time to having some instances where good fails before succeeding.<ref name=\":1\" /> The critical and popular success of ''Rosemary's Baby'', led to the release of more films with occult themes in the 1970s, such as ''[[The Omen]]'' (1976), wherein a man realizes that his five-year-old adopted son is the [[Antichrist]]. Invincible to human intervention, demons became villains in many horror films with a [[Postmodernism|postmodern]] style and a [[dystopia]]n worldview.\n\n''[[Don't Look Now]]'' (1973), an independent British-Italian film directed by [[Nicolas Roeg]], was also notable. Its focus on the psychology of grief was unusually strong for a film featuring a supernatural horror plot. Another notable film is ''[[The Wicker Man]]'' (1973), a British [[Mystery film|mystery]] horror film dealing with the practice of ancient pagan rituals in the modern era. In the 1970s, Italian filmmakers [[Mario Bava]], [[Riccardo Freda]], [[Antonio Margheriti]], and [[Dario Argento]] developed [[giallo]] horror films that became classics and influenced the genre in other countries. Representative films include: ''[[The Bird with the Crystal Plumage]],''[[Twitch of the Death Nerve]]'', and ''[[Deep Red]]''.\n\nThe ideas of the 1960s began to influence horror films in the 70s, as the youth involved in the [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]] began exploring the medium. [[Wes Craven]]'s ''[[The Hills Have Eyes (1977 film)|The Hills Have Eyes]]'' (1977) and ''[[The Last House on the Left (1972 film)|The Last House on the Left]]'' (1972) along with [[Tobe Hooper]]'s ''[[The Texas Chain Saw Massacre]]'' (1974)<ref>{{cite web|title=Cannibalistic Capitalism and other American Delicacies|url=http://www.film-philosophy.com/index.php/f-p/article/view/190|work=Naomi Merritt}}</ref> recalled the [[Vietnam War]]; while [[George A. Romero]] satirized the consumer society in his zombie sequel, ''[[Dawn of the Dead (1978 film)|Dawn of the Dead]]'' (1978). Meanwhile, the subgenre of [[comedy horror]] re-emerged in the cinema with ''[[The Abominable Dr. Phibes]]'' (1971), ''[[Young Frankenstein]]'' (1974), ''[[The Rocky Horror Picture Show]]'' (1975), and ''[[An American Werewolf in London]]'' (1981) among others.\n\nAlso in the 1970s, the works of the horror author [[Stephen King]] began to be adapted for the screen, beginning with [[Brian De Palma]]'s adaptation of ''[[Carrie (1976 film)|Carrie]]'' (1976), King's first published novel, for which the two female leads ([[Sissy Spacek]] and [[Piper Laurie]]) gained [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] nominations. Next, was his third published novel, ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]'' (1980), directed by [[Stanley Kubrick]], which was a [[Sleeper hit|sleeper]] at the box office. At first, many critics and viewers had negative feedback toward ''The Shining''. However, the film is now known as one of Hollywood's most classic horror films.\n\nThis psychological horror film has a variety of themes: \"evil children\", alcoholism, [[telepathy]], and insanity. This type of film is an example of how Hollywood's idea of horror started to evolve. Murder and violence were no longer the main themes of horror films. In the 1970s and 1980s, psychological and supernatural horror started to take over cinema. Another classic Hollywood horror film is [[Tobe Hooper]]'s ''[[Poltergeist (1982 film)|Poltergeist]]'' (1982). ''Poltergeist'' is ranked the 20th scariest movie ever made by the [[Chicago Film Critics Association]]. Both ''The Shining'' and ''Poltergeist'' involve horror being based on real-estate values. The evil and horror throughout the films come from where the movies are taking place.<ref>''The American Horror Film'' by Reynold Humphries</ref><ref>''American Horror Film'' edited by Stefen Hantke</ref>\n\n''[[The Amityville Horror (1979 film)|The Amityville Horror]]'' is a 1979 supernatural horror film directed by [[Stuart Rosenberg]], based on [[Jay Anson]]'s [[1977 in literature|1977]] [[The Amityville Horror|book of the same name]]. It stars [[James Brolin]] and [[Margot Kidder]] as a young couple who purchase a home they come to find haunted by combative supernatural forces. ''[[The Changeling (1980 film)|The Changeling]]'' is a 1980 Canadian supernatural psychological horror film directed by [[Peter Medak]].\n\n[[Steven Spielberg]]'s shark horror film, ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'' (1975), began a new wave of killer animal stories, such as ''[[Orca (film)|Orca]]'' (1977) and ''[[Up from the Depths]]'' (1979). ''Jaws'' is often credited as being one of the first films to use traditionally [[B movie]] elements such as horror and mild gore in a big-budget Hollywood film. In 1979, [[Don Coscarelli]]'s ''[[Phantasm (film)|Phantasm]]'' was the first of the [[Phantasm (franchise)|Phantasm series]].\n\nA cycle of [[slasher film]]s began in the 1970s and 1980s with the creation of ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'' by [[John Carpenter]]. \"Halloween\" was a significant influence on the horror industry and has become one of the quintessential forerunners of commercial horror films, grossing 70 Million usd on a shoestring budget of $300,000\u2013325,000.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Halloween-(1978)|title=Halloween (1978) - Financial Information|website=The Numbers}}</ref> Its influence and inspiration can still be seen in films today.\n\nAnother notable 1970s slasher films are [[Bob Clark]]'s ''[[Black Christmas (1974 film)|Black Christmas]]'' (1974). ''[[Sleepaway Camp]]'' (1983) is known for its [[twist ending]], which is considered by some to be one of the most shocking endings among horror films. ''[[My Bloody Valentine (film)|My Bloody Valentine]]'' (1981) is a slasher film dealing with [[Valentine's Day]] fiction.\n\nThe boom in slasher films provided enough material for numerous comedic [[Parody film|spoofs]] of the genre including ''[[Saturday the 14th]]'' (1981), ''[[Student Bodies]]'' (1981), ''[[National Lampoon's Class Reunion]]'' (1982), and ''[[Hysterical (film)|Hysterical]]'' (1983).\n\nThis subgenre would be mined by dozens of increasingly violent movies throughout the subsequent decades. [[Sean S. Cunningham]] made ''[[Friday the 13th (1980 film)|Friday the 13th]]'' (1980), [[Wes Craven]] directed ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'' (1984), and [[Clive Barker]] made ''[[Hellraiser]]'' (1987).\n\nSome films explored [[urban legend]]s such as \"[[The babysitter and the man upstairs]]\".\nA notable example is ''[[When a Stranger Calls (1979 film)|When a Stranger Calls]]'' (1979), an American psychological horror film directed by [[Fred Walton (director)|Fred Walton]] starring [[Carol Kane]] and [[Charles Durning]].\n\n''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'' (1979), a British-American [[science fiction film|science-fiction]] horror film directed by [[Ridley Scott]] was very successful, receiving both critical acclaim and being a box office success. John Carpenter's movie ''[[The Thing (1982 film)|The Thing]]'' (1982) was also a mix of horror and sci-fi, but it was neither a box-office nor critical hit, but soon became a cult classic. However, nearly 20 years after its release, it was praised for using ahead-of-its-time special effects and paranoia.\n\nThe 1980s saw a wave of gory \"B movie\" horror films \u2013 although most of them were poorly reviewed by critics, many became [[cult film|cult classics]] and later saw success with critics. A significant example is [[Sam Raimi]]'s ''[[The Evil Dead (franchise)|Evil Dead]]'' movies, which were low-budget gorefests but had a very original plotline which was later praised by critics. In the Philippines, the first ''[[Shake, Rattle & Roll (film)|Shake, Rattle & Roll]]'' (1984) was released. The horror anthology film spawned [[Shake, Rattle & Roll (film series)|a series of films]] in the country over the subsequent decades.\n\n''[[Day of the Dead (1985 film)|Day of the Dead]]'' is a 1985 horror film written and directed by [[George A. Romero]] and the third film in Romero's ''[[Night of the Living Dead (film series)|Night of the Living Dead]]'' series.\n\n[[Vampire films|Vampire horror]] was also popular in the 1980s, including cult vampire classics such as ''[[Fright Night]]'' (1985), ''[[The Lost Boys]]'' (1987), and ''[[Near Dark]]'' (also 1987). In 1984, [[Joe Dante]]'s seminal monster comedy horror ''[[Gremlins]]'' became a box office hit with critics and audiences, and inspired a trend of \"little monster\" films such as ''[[Critters (film)|Critters]]'' and ''[[Ghoulies]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/how-gremlins-spawned-a-mini-monster-trend-30-years-87121103742.html|title=How 'Gremlins' Spawned a Mini-Monster Trend 30 Years Ago|website=www.yahoo.com|publisher=Yahoo!

The slasher films, ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'', ''[[Friday the 13th (1980 film)|Friday the 13th]]'', ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'', and ''[[Child's Play (1988 film)|Child's Play]]'', all saw sequels in the 1990s, most of which met with varied amounts of success at the box office, but all were negatively reviewed by critics, with the exception of Wes Craven's ''[[Wes Craven's New Nightmare|New Nightmare]]'' (1994), and the hugely successful film, ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|The Silence of the Lambs]]'' (1991). The latter, which stars [[Jodie Foster]] and [[Anthony Hopkins]], is considered a major horror movie of all times.<ref>[https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-16344420 \"Silence of the Lambs Added to US Film Archive\"] (28 December 2011). ''BBC.com''. Retrieved 24 June 2018.</ref> ''[[Misery (film)|Misery]]'' (1990) also deals with a psychopath, and the film received critical acclaim for [[Kathy Bates]]'s performance as the psychopathic [[Annie Wilkes]].\nTSeven 1995 Brad Pitt Morgan Freeman Kevin Spacey\n''[[Wes Craven's New Nightmare|New Nightmare]]'', with ''[[In the Mouth of Madness]]'' (1995), ''[[The Dark Half (film)|The Dark Half]]'' (1993), and ''[[Candyman (1992 film)|Candyman]]'' (1992), were part of a mini-movement of self-reflexive or [[metafiction]]al horror films. Each film touched upon the relationship between fictional horror and real-world horror. ''Candyman'', for example, examined the link between an invented urban legend, and the realistic horror of the racism that produced its villain. ''In the Mouth of Madness'' took a more literal approach, as its protagonist actually hopped from the real world into a novel created by the madman he was hired to track down. This reflective style became more overt and ironic with the arrival of ''[[Scream (1996 film)|Scream]]'' (1996).\nIn ''[[Interview with the Vampire (film)|Interview with the Vampire]]'' (1994), the \"Theatre de Vampires\" (and the film itself, to some degree) invoked the [[Grand Guignol]] style, perhaps to further remove the undead performers from humanity, morality and class. The horror movie soon continued its search for new and effective frights. In the 1985 novel, ''[[The Vampire Lestat]]'', by the author [[Anne Rice]] (who penned ''Interview with the Vampire''{{'}}s screenplay and the 1976 novel of the same name) suggests that its antihero Lestat inspired and nurtured the Grand Guignol style and theatre.\n\nTwo main problems pushed horror backward during this period: firstly, the horror genre wore itself out with the proliferation of nonstop slasher and gore films in the eighties. Secondly, the adolescent audience which feasted on the blood and morbidity of the previous decade grew up, and the replacement audience for films of an imaginative nature were being captured instead by the explosion of [[Science fiction film|science-fiction]] and fantasy films, courtesy of the special effects possibilities with advances made in [[computer-generated imagery]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mediaknowall.com/Horror/eighties.html |title=Horror Films in the 1980s |publisher=Mediaknowall.com |accessdate=24 April 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217005221/http://www.mediaknowall.com/Horror/eighties.html |archivedate=17 February 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>  Examples of these CGI include movies like ''[[Species (film)|Species]]'' (1995), ''[[Anaconda (film)|Anaconda]]'' (1997), ''[[Mimic (film)|Mimic]]'' (1997), ''[[Blade (film)|Blade]]'' (1998), ''[[Deep Rising]]'' (1998), ''[[House on Haunted Hill (1999 film)|House on Haunted Hill]]'' (1999), ''[[Sleepy Hollow (film)|Sleepy Hollow]]'' (1999), and ''[[The Haunting (1999 film)|The Haunting]]'' (1999).\n\nTo re-connect with its audience, horror became more self-mockingly [[Irony|ironic]] and outright [[Parody|parodic]], especially in the latter half of the 1990s. Peter Jackson's ''[[Braindead (1992 film)|Braindead]]'' (1992) (known as ''Dead Alive'' in the United States) took the [[splatter film]] to ridiculous excesses for comic effect. Wes Craven's ''[[Scream (1996 film)|Scream]]'' (written by [[Kevin Williamson (screenwriter)|Kevin Williamson]]) movies, starting in 1996, featured teenagers who were fully aware of, and often made reference to, the history of horror movies, and mixed ironic humour with the shocks (despite ''[[Scream 2]]'' and ''[[Scream 3]]'' utilising less use of the humour of the original, until ''[[Scream 4]]'' in 2011, and rather more references to horror film conventions). Along with ''[[I Know What You Did Last Summer]]'' (1997) (also written by Williamson) and ''[[Urban Legend (film)|Urban Legend]]'' (1998), they re-ignited the dormant [[slasher film]] genre.\n\n''[[Event Horizon (film)|Event Horizon]]'' (1997) is a British-American science fiction horror film directed by [[Paul W. S. Anderson]]. ''[[The Sixth Sense]]'' (1999) is a supernatural horror film written and directed by [[M. Night Shyamalan]], which tells the story of Cole Sear ([[Haley Joel Osment]]), a troubled, isolated boy who is able to see and talk to the dead, and an equally troubled [[child psychologist]] named Malcolm Crowe ([[Bruce Willis]]) who tries to help him.\n\n''[[House on Haunted Hill (1999 film)|House on Haunted Hill]]'' is a 1999 horror film directed by [[William Malone (director)|William Malone]] which follows a group of strangers who are invited to a party at an abandoned asylum, where they are offered $1 million each by an amusement park [[Magnate|mogul]] if they are able to survive the night. It is a remake of the [[House on Haunted Hill|1959 film of the same title]]. Other horror films of the late 1990s include ''[[Cube (film)|Cube]]'' (1997), ''[[The Faculty]]'' (1998), ''[[Disturbing Behavior]]'' (1998), ''[[Stir of Echoes]]'' (1999), ''[[Stigmata (film)|Stigmata]]'' (1999), and ''[[Existenz]]'' (1999).\n\n[[Monster]] horror was quite popular in the 1990s.

''[[Lake Placid (film)|Lake Placid]]'' (1999) is another monster horror film, written by [[David E.

Around this period, [[Japanese horror]] started becoming popular in English speaking countries.\n\nIn South Korea, the success of [[supernatural horror film]] [[Whispering Corridors]] (1998) by\nPark Ki-hyung, sparked the explosion of Korean horror.\n\nThe film ''[[The Last Broadcast (film)|The Last Broadcast]]'' (1998) served as inspiration for the highly successful ''[[The Blair Witch Project]]'' (1999), which popularized the [[Found footage (film technique)|found footage]] horror subgenre. The theme of [[witchcraft]] was also addressed in ''[[The Witches (1990 film)|The Witches]]'' (1990), starring [[Anjelica Huston]], and ''[[The Craft (film)|The Craft]]'' (1996), a supernatural horror film directed by [[Andrew Fleming]].

A minimalist approach which was equal parts Val Lewton's theory of \"less is more\", usually employing the low-budget techniques utilized on ''[[The Blair Witch Project]]'' (1999), has been evident, particularly in the emergence of Asian horror movies which have been remade into successful Americanized versions, such as ''[[The Ring (2002 film)|The Ring]]'' (2002), ''[[The Grudge]]'' (2004), ''[[Dark Water (2005 film)|Dark Water]]'' (2005), and ''[[Pulse (2006 film)|Pulse]]'' (2006).

This study used the inter-subject correlation analysis (ISC) method of determining results. It was shown that audience members tend to focus on certain facets in a particular scene simultaneously and tend to sit as still as possible while watching horror films. In another study done by Glenn Sparks, it was found that the audience tends to experience the [[Excitation-transfer theory|excitation transfer process]] (ETP) which causes a physiological arousal in audience members. The ETP refers to the feelings experienced immediately after watching a horror film, specifically in which audience members\u2019 heart rate, blood pressure and respiration all increase. Audience members with positive feedback regarding the horror film have feelings similar to happiness or joy felt with friends, but intensified. Alternatively, audience members with negative feedback regarding the film would typically feel emotions they would normally associate with negative experiences in their life. Only about 10% of the American population enjoy the physiological rush felt immediately after watching horror films. The population that does not enjoy horror films could experience emotional fallout similar to that of [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|PTSD]] if the environment reminds them of particular scenes.\n\n=== Different techniques employed by horror films on the audience ===\nIn a study by Jacob Shelton, the many ways that audience members are manipulated through horror films was investigated in detail.<ref name=\":03\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.ranker.com/list/horror-movie-tricks-for-scaring-the-audience/jacob-shelton|title=15 Ways You Didn't Even Realize Horror Movies Are Manipulating You Into Fear|website=Ranker|language=en|access-date=2019-11-22}}</ref> [[Negative space]] is one such method that can play a part in inducing a reaction, causing one's eyes to remotely rest on anything in the frame - a wall, or the empty black void in the shadows.<ref name=\":03\" /> In an ideal horror film, there is a perfect balance of negative and positive space.<ref name=\":03\" /> Another method is a [[subversion]] of classic horror tropes - the [[jump scare]].<ref name=\":03\" /> In classic horror films, the jump scare is right after an individual closes the bathroom mirror with their reflection shown or other such situations.<ref name=\":03\" /> Alternatively, it is when there is no jump scare that causes the audience to feel more unease and discomfort because they do not know when it will happen, only that it is anticipated.<ref name=\":03\" />\n\nThe meaning of mirrors in horror films is that they create visual depth that builds tension.<ref name=\":03\"/> Audience members have ingrained the fear of mirrors due to the use of them in classic horror films.<ref name=\":03\" /> Even if there is no jump scare succeeding a mirror scene, individuals are still trained to fear the mirror no matter what.<ref name=\":03\" /> Mirrors illustrate the characters' duality and \u201creal\u201d version of themselves.<ref name=\":03\" /> In any case, mirrors altogether make the audience anxious, while patiently waiting for a jump scare that may or may not occur.<ref name=\":03\" />\n\nTight framing is another technique used, where an entire scene can be created with a [[close-up]].<ref name=\":03\" /> Tight framing can be terrifying as they induce anxiety by not allowing the viewer to see what's directly around the [[protagonist]].<ref name=\":03\" /> The suspense of not knowing builds on the unknown and tension of the audience.<ref name=\":03\" />\n\n=== Physical effects of horror films on the audience ===\nIn a study by Medes et al., prolonged exposure to [[infrasound]] and low-frequency noise (<500&nbsp;Hz) in long durations has an effect on vocal range (i.e. longer exposure tends to form a lower phonation frequency range).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mendes|first=Ana P.|date=Fall 2019|title=Voice Acoustic Profile of Males Exposed to Occupational Infrasound and Low-Frequency Noise|journal=Journal of Laryngology & Voice|volume=4|pages=12\u201320|doi=10.4103/2230-9748.141460|hdl=10400.26/14507|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/9a2da891e571fc137548efa5493973cf3651c711}}</ref> Another study by Baliatsas et al. observed that there is a correlation between exposure to infrasound and low-frequency noises and sleep-related problems.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Baliatsas|first=Christos|date=Fall 2019|title=Health Effects from Low-Frequency Noise and Infrasound in the General Population: Is It Time to Listen?

One of the most noticeable side effects is sleeplessness. A person may have trouble sleeping or toss all night due to the residual fear and anxiety from watching a horror movie. They can cause trauma if their content is similar to real life events. For example, if a person went through a serious car accident, a film such as ''[[Final Destination 2]]'' could be harmful for the person\u2019s mental health.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20180815101243/https://edinazephyrus.com/psychological-effects-of-horror-movies/</ref>\n\n==Influences==\n===Influences on society===\nHorror films' evolution throughout the years has given society a new approach to resourcefully utilize their benefits. The horror film style has changed over time, but, in 1996, ''Scream'' set off a \"chain of copycats\", leading to a new variety of teenage, horror movies.<ref name=Stack>{{cite magazine|last=Stack|first=Tim|title=Oh, The Horror.|url=http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?vid=3&hid=21&sid=f974de41-a7e4-4577-88d9-fbc1438149fa@sessionmgr14&bdata=JmxvZ2luLmFzcCZzaXRlPWVob3N0LWxpdmU=|magazine=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=19 April 2012}}</ref> This new approach to horror films began to gradually earn more and more revenue as seen in the progress of ''Scream'' movies; the first movie earned $6 million and the third movie earned $101 million.<ref name=Stack /> The importance that horror films have gained in the public and producers\u2019 eyes is one obvious effect on our society.\n\nHorror films' income expansion is only the first sign of the influences of horror flicks. The role of women and how women see themselves in the movie industry has been altered by the horror genre. Early horror films such as ''[[My Bloody Valentine (film)|My Bloody Valentine]]'' (1981), ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'' (1978), and ''[[Friday the 13th (1980 film)|Friday the 13th]]'' (1980) were produced mostly for male audiences in order to \"feed the fantasies of young men\".<ref name=Nowell>{{cite web|last=Nowell|first=Richard|title=\"There's More Than One Way to Lose Your Heart\": the American film industry, early teen slasher films, and female youth.\"|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/retrieve.do?sgHitCountType=None&sort=DA-SORT&inPS=true&prodId=GPS&userGroupName=mtlib_1_1123&tabID=T002&searchId=R2&resultListType=RESULT_LIST&contentSegment=&searchType=BasicSearchForm\u00a4tPosition=4&contentSet=GALE%7CA277106285&&docId=GALE%7cA277106285&docType=GALE&role=AONE|publisher=Cinema Journal|accessdate=24 April 2012}}</ref> This idea is no longer prevalent in horror films, as women have become not only the main audience and fans of horror films but also the main protagonists of contemporary horror films.<ref name=Spines>{{cite magazine|last=Spines|first=Christine|title=Chicks dig scary movies.|url=https://www.ew.com/article/2009/07/24/chicks-dig-scary-movies|magazine=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=15 April 2012}}</ref> Movie makers have also begun to integrate topics more broadly associated with other genres into their films in order to grow audience appeal.<ref name=Nowell />\n\nMany early horror films created great social and legal [[controversy]]. In the U.S., the [[Motion Picture Production Code]] which was implemented in 1930, set moral guidelines for film content, restraining movies containing controversial themes, graphic violence, explicit sexuality and/or nudity. The gradual abandonment of the Code, and its eventual formal repeal in 1968 (when it was replaced by the [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|MPAA film rating system]]) offered more freedom to the movie industry. Nevertheless, controversy continued to surround horror movies, and many continued to face [[censorship]] issues around the world. For example, 1978's ''[[I Spit on Your Grave]]'', an American [[rape and revenge film|rape-and-revenge]] [[exploitation film|exploitation]] horror film written, co-produced, directed, and edited by [[Meir Zarchi]], was received negatively by critics, but it attracted a great deal of national and international attention due to its explicit scenes of rape, murder and prolonged nudity, which led to bans in countries such as Ireland, Norway, Iceland, and West Germany. Many of these countries later removed the ban, but the film remains prohibited in Ireland.<ref>Clarke, Donald (29 September 2010).

Horror movies tend to be a vessel for showing eras of audiences issues across the globe visually and in the most effective manner. Jeanne Hall, a film theorist, agrees with the use of horror films in easing the process of understanding issues by making use of their optical elements.<ref name=Lizardi>{{cite web|last=Lizardi|first=Ryan|title=Hegemony and Misogyny in the Contemporary Slasher Remake|url=http://content.ebscohost.com/pdf23_24/pdf/2010/JFT/01Sep10/53843762.pdf?T=P&P=AN&K=53843762&S=R&D=f3h&EbscoContent=dGJyMNHX8kSep7I4v%2BbwOLCmr0qeqK9Srq%2B4SLeWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMPGutk%2BuqLZLuePfgeyx44Dt6fIA|publisher=Journal of Popular Film and Television}}</ref> The use of horror films to help audiences understand international prior historical events occurs, for example, to depict the horrors of the [[Vietnam War]], the [[Holocaust]] and the worldwide [[AIDS epidemic]].<ref name=\"History Horror\">{{cite book|last=Heller-Nicholas|first=Alexandra|title=History and Horror|publisher=Screen Education}}</ref> However, horror movies do not always present positive endings.

She then sailed to [[Fiji]], to stop any further Japanese advance into the Pacific. Next, she supported the landings on [[Tarawa]], the [[Marshall Islands]], [[Saipan]], [[Guam]], and [[Tinian]]. On 24 July 1944, during the shelling of Tinian, ''Colorado'' received 22 shell hits from shore batteries, but continued to support the invading troops until 3 August.

She was [[Ceremonial ship launching|launched]] on 22 March 1921, and [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 30 August 1923. She was armed with eight {{convert|16|in|mm|adj=on|0}} guns and fourteen 5-inch (127&nbsp;mm) deck guns; two 5-inch guns were removed in an overhaul.\n\nShe was the third US navy ship named ''Colorado'', but only the second named for [[Colorado|the 38th state]], the first {{USS|Colorado|1856|2}} was named for the [[Colorado River]].<ref>{{cite web |first=Ken |last= Chamberlain |url=https://www.navytimes.com/news/your-navy/2018/03/17/taking-a-look-at-the-uss-colorado-all-of-them/ |title= Taking a look at the USS Colorado - All of them | publisher= navytimes.com |date= 17 March 2018 |accessdate= 9 August 2018}}</ref>\n\n''Colorado'' took her maiden voyage in 1923, to Europe. She later operated with the [[Battle Fleet]] and sailed through the Pacific during the interwar years. She also underwent a further refit, during which her four {{convert|3|in|adj=on|0}} anti-aircraft guns were replaced with an equal number of [[5\"/25 caliber gun|{{convert|5|in|mm|abbr=on|0}}/25 cal gun]]s.{{efn|/25 refers to the length of the gun in terms of [[Caliber (artillery)|calibers]]. A /25 gun is 25 times long as it is in bore diameter.}}\n\nDuring the early part of World War II, ''Colorado'' undertook a defensive patrol near the [[Golden Gate Bridge]] in May 1942, to stop a possible Japanese invasion. She then sailed to [[Fiji]], to stop any further Japanese advance into the Pacific. Next, she supported the landings on [[Tarawa]], the [[Marshall Islands]], [[Saipan]], [[Guam]], and [[Tinian]]. On 24 July 1944, during the shelling of Tinian, ''Colorado'' received 22 shell hits from shore batteries, but continued to support the invading troops until 3 August. She later arrived in [[Leyte Gulf]] on 20 November 1944, to support American troops fighting ashore. On 27 November, she was hit by two ''[[kamikaze]]s'' which caused moderate damage.\n\nAfter that, ''Colorado'' sailed to [[Luzon]] on 1 January 1945, where she participated in the preinvasion bombardments in [[Lingayen Gulf]]. She returned to [[Okinawa]] on 6 August and sailed from there to [[Japan]] for the occupation of the country, arriving in [[Tokyo]] on 27 August. Departing Tokyo Bay on 20 September, she arrived at San Francisco on 15 October. She was placed out of commission in reserve in Pearl Harbor on 7 January 1947, and sold for scrapping on 23 July 1959.

Undergoing overhaul at the [[Puget Sound Navy Yard]], she was not present for the attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December. During the refit, which was completed on 31 March 1942, two of the 12 original 5 in/51 caliber guns were removed, and were replaced by an equal number of 5 in/38 caliber guns.{{sfn|Breyer|1973|p=230}} \n\nAfter refit ''Colorado'' carried out extensive training maneuvers along the West Coast.  On 31 May, she and {{USS|Maryland|BB-46|2}} patrolled near [[Golden Gate Bridge]] to protect [[San Francisco]] from any Japanese attack.{{sfn|Turner Publishing|2002|p=15}}.  Some time after this she returned to Pearl Harbor to complete her final preparations for action. She operated in the vicinity of the [[Fiji|Fiji Islands]] and [[New Hebrides]] from 8 November 1942 to 17 September 1943 to prevent any further Japanese expansion in the Pacific. She sailed from Pearl Harbor on 21 October 1943 to provide pre-invasion shelling and fire support for the invasion of [[Tarawa]], returning to port on 7 December 1943. After another overhaul on the West Coast, ''Colorado'' returned to [[Lahaina Roads]], in the [[Hawaiian Islands]], on 21 January 1944 and sortied the next day for the [[Marshall Islands]]. She provided the pre-invasion bombardment and fire support for the invasions of [[Kwajalein]] and [[Eniwetok]] until 23 February, when she headed for the Puget Sound Navy Yard for another overhaul.{{sfn|Turner Publishing|2002|p=16}}\n\nShe joined other units going for the [[Mariana Islands]] at the harbor at San Francisco. She departed on 5 May passing Pearl Harbor and Kwajalein to the pre-invasion shelling at [[Saipan]], [[Guam]], and [[Tinian]] after 14 June. During the shelling of Tinian on 24 July she was damaged, 43 men were killed, and 198 wounded by 22 shell hits from Japanese shore batteries; she continued shelling the island and providing fire support for the invasion troops. After undergoing extensive repairs along the West Coast, she arrived in [[Leyte Gulf]] to begin the invasion of Leyte. A week after her arrival she was struck by two ''[[kamikaze]]'' bombers, which killed 19 crewmembers, injured 72, and moderately damaged the ship. Despite the damage, she bombarded [[Mindoro]] on schedule from 12 to 17 December 1944. She then proceeded to [[Manus Island]] for urgent repairs.{{sfn|DANFS Colorado (BB-45)}}{{sfn|Turner Publishing|2002|p=16}}\n\nShe returned to [[Luzon]] on New Year's Day 1945 to participate in the pre-invasion shelling of the [[Lingayen Gulf]].
