This combination of activities is referred to as pipeline marketing.\n\nA lead is usually allotted to an individual to follow up on. Once the individual (e.g. salesperson) reviews and qualifies it to have potential business, the lead gets converted to an opportunity for a business. The opportunity then has to undergo multiple sales stages before the deal is won.\n\n== B2B Lead Generation ==\n'''B2B (Business-to-Business)''' is the occurrence of a transaction between a business entity to another business entity. It is a process acquiring new leads for your business. Also, collecting potential customers information about qualified prospects including their contact details like name, age, gender, company name, URL, job title and location etc; which can be done via email marketing, cold calls, [[Google Ads|Google ads]] or events to generate quality leads.\n\n==Leads==\nA lead usually is the contact information and in some cases, demographic information of a customer who is interested in a specific product or service. There are two types of leads in the lead generation market: sales leads and marketing leads.\n\n'''Sales leads''' are generated on the basis of demographic criteria such as [[Credit score (United States)#FICO score and others|FICO score (United States)]], income, age, [[household income]], [[psychographic]], etc. These leads are resold to multiple advertisers. Sales leads are typically followed up through phone calls by the sales force. Sales leads are commonly found in the mortgage, insurance and finance industries.\n\n'''Marketing leads''' are brand-specific leads generated for a unique advertiser offer. In direct contrast to sales leads, marketing leads are sold only once. Because transparency is a necessary requisite for generating marketing leads, marketing lead campaigns can be optimized by mapping leads to their sources.\n\nAn '''investor lead''' is a type of a sales lead. An investor lead is the identity of a person or entity potentially interested in participating in an investment, and represents the first stage of an investment sales process. [[Investor]] leads are considered to have some [[disposable income]] that they can use to participate in appropriate investment opportunities in exchange for [[return on investment]] in the form of [[interest]], [[dividend]], [[profit sharing]] or asset appreciation. Investor lead lists are normally generated through investment [[Statistical survey|surveys]], investor newsletter subscriptions or through companies raising capital and selling the database of people who expressed an interest in their opportunity. Investor Lead lists are commonly used by small businesses looking to fund their [[wikt:venture|venture]] or simply needing expansion [[Capital (economics)|capital]] that was not readily available by [[bank]]s and traditional lending sources.\n\n==Lead Qualification Status==\nBusiness leads are often grouped into segments to the level of qualification present within an organization. \n\n'''Marketing Qualified Leads (MQLs)''' are leads that have typically come through Inbound channels, such as Web Search or content marketing, and have expressed interest in a company's product or service. These leads have yet to interact with sales teams.\n\n'''Sales Qualified Leads (SQLs)''' are leads screened by salespeople, oftentimes Sales Development Representatives (SDRs), for appropriate qualifying criteria to be followed-up with. Qualifying criteria include need, budget, capacity, time-frame, interest, or authority to purchase.\n\n==Online lead generation==\n'''Online lead generation''' is an [[Internet marketing]] term that refers to the generation of prospective consumer interest or inquiry into a [[business]]' products or services through the [[Internet]]. Leads, also known as contacts, can be generated for a variety of purposes: list building, e-newsletter list acquisition, building out reward programs, loyalty programs or for other member acquisition programs.\n\n=== Social media ===\nWith the rise of social networking websites, social media is used by organizations and individuals to generate leads or gain business opportunities. Many companies actively participate on social networks including [[LinkedIn]], [[Twitter]] and [[Facebook]] to find talent pools or market their new products and services.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.bluevelvet.agency/2019/12/12/are-wasting-time-with-social-media-for-lead-generation/ | title=Are You Wasting Time with Social Media for Lead Generation? | work=bluevelvet.agency | date=12 September 2019 | accessdate=12 September 2019 | author=Gregg Schwartz}}</ref>\n\n=== Email Marketing ===\nEmail remains one of the main ways that businesses communicate with clients & vendors. Because of this, marketers often send messages to users\u2019 inboxes.  Many leads are generated every day with [[Cold email|cold email]] campaigns and warm email campaigns. For the foreseeable future email campaigns remain a great [[email marketing]] tool.\n\n=== Online advertising ===\nThere are three main pricing models in the online advertising market that marketers can use to buy advertising and generate leads:\n\n*[[Cost per thousand]] (e.g. [[CPM Group]], [[Advertising.com]]), also known as cost per mille (CPM), uses pricing models that charge advertisers for impressions \u2014 i.e. the number of times people view an advertisement. Display advertising is commonly sold on a CPM pricing model. The problem with CPM advertising is that advertisers are charged even if the target audience does not click on (or even view) the advertisement.\n*[[Cost per click]] advertising (e.g. [[AdWords]], [[Yahoo! Search Marketing]]) overcomes this problem by charging advertisers only when the consumer clicks on the advertisement. However, due to increased competition, search keywords have become very expensive. A 2007 Doubleclick Performics Search trends report shows that there were nearly six times as many keywords with a cost per click (CPC) of more than $1 in January 2007 than the prior year. The cost per keyword increased by 33% and the cost per click rose by as much as 55%.\n*[[Cost per acquisition]] advertising (e.g. [[TalkLocal]], [[Thumbtack (website)|Thumbtack]]) addresses the risk of CPM and CPC advertising by charging only by the lead.  Like CPC, the price per lead can be bid up by demand.  Also, like CPC, there are ways in which providers can commit fraud by manufacturing leads or blending one source of lead with another (example: search-driven leads with co-registration leads) to generate higher profits.  For such marketers looking to pay only for specific actions/acquisition, there are two options: CPL advertising (or online lead generation) and CPA advertising (also referred to as affiliate marketing).  In CPL campaigns, advertisers pay for an interested lead \u2014 i.e. the contact information of a person interested in the advertiser's product or service. CPL campaigns are suitable for brand marketers and direct response marketers looking to engage consumers at multiple touchpoints \u2014 by building a newsletter list, community site, reward program or member acquisition program.  In CPA campaigns, the advertiser typically pays for a completed sale involving a credit card transaction.\n\nRecently,{{When|date=November 2010}} there has been a rapid increase in online lead generation: banner and direct response advertising that works off a CPL pricing model. In a pay-per-acquisition (PPA) pricing model, advertisers pay only for qualified leads resulting from\nthose actions, irrespective of the clicks or impressions that went into generating the lead. PPA advertising is playing an active role in online lead generation.\n\nPPA pricing models are more advertiser-friendly as they are less susceptible to fraud and bots. With [[Pay-per-click|pay per click]], providers can commit fraud by manufacturing leads or blending one source of lead with another (example: search-driven leads with co-registration leads) to generate higher profits for themselves.\n\nA GP Bullhound research report stated that the online lead generation was growing at 71% YTY{{when|date=January 2012}} \u2014 more than twice as fast as the online advertising market. The rapid growth is primarily driven by the advertiser demand for ROI focused marketing, a trend that is expected to accelerate during a recession.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}\n\nCommon types of opt-in ad units include:\n*Co-registration advertising: The advertiser receives some or all of the standard fields collected by a site during the site's registration process.\n*Full page lead generation: The advertiser's offer appears as a full page ad in an HTML format with relevant text and graphics. The advertiser receives the standard fields and answers to as many as twenty custom questions that s/he defines.\n*[[Online survey]]s: Consumers are asked to complete a survey, including their demographic information and product and lifestyle interests. This information is used as a sales lead for advertisers, who purchase the consumer's information if provided. The consumer may 'opt-in' to receive correspondence from the advertiser and is therefore considered a ''qualified lead''.\nA common advertising metric for lead generation is cost per lead. The formula is Cost / Leads, for example if you created 100 leads and it cost $1000, the cost per lead would be $10.\n\n=== Healthcare ===\n{{Refimprove section|date=February 2013}}\nMany [[Healthcare industry|private healthcare organizations]] use online lead generation as a way to contact their existing patients and to acquire new patients.\n\n\"The number of Cyberchondriacs has jumped to 175 million from 154 million last year, possibly as a result of the health care reform debate.

The most common types of power tools use [[electric motor]]s. [[Internal combustion engine]]s and [[compressed air]] are also commonly used. Other power sources include [[steam engine]]s, direct burning of fuels and propellants, such as in [[powder-actuated tool]]s, or even natural power sources such as [[wind power|wind]] or [[hydropower|moving water]]. Tools directly driven by [[animal power]] are not generally considered power tools.\n\nPower tools are used in industry, in [[construction]], in the [[garden]], for [[Homemaking|housework]] tasks such as [[Outline of food preparation#Food preparation techniques|cooking]], [[housekeeping|cleaning]], and [[Do it yourself|around the house]] for purposes of driving ([[fastener]]s), [[drill]]ing, [[saw|cutting]], shaping, [[sander|sanding]], grinding, [[wood router|routing]], polishing, painting, heating and more.\n\nPower tools are classified as either stationary or portable, where portable means hand-held. Portable power tools have obvious advantages in mobility. Stationary power tools, however, often have advantages in speed and precision. A typical table saw, for instance, not only cuts faster than a regular hand saw, but the cuts are smoother, straighter, and more square than what is normally achievable with a hand-held power saw. Some stationary power tools can produce objects that cannot be made in any other way. [[lathe (tool)|Lathes]], for example,  produce truly round objects.\n\nStationary power tools for [[metalworking]] are usually called [[machine tools]]. The term ''machine tool'' is not usually applied to stationary power tools for [[woodworking]], although such usage is occasionally heard, and in some cases, such as [[Drill#Drill press|drill presses]] and [[bench grinder]]s, exactly the same tool is used for both woodworking and metalworking.\n\n==History==\nThe [[lathe]] is the oldest power tool, being known to the ancient Egyptians (albeit in a hand-powered form). Early [[industrial revolution]]-era factories had batteries of power tools driven by belts from overhead shafts. The prime power source was a water wheel or (later) a steam engine. The introduction of the electric motor (and electric distribution networks) in the 1880s made possible the self-powered stationary and portable tools we know today.<ref>{{cite web|title=Modern Marvels: The World's First Power Tools|url=http://www.history.com/videos/the-worlds-first-power-tools|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130125083128/http://www.history.com/videos/the-worlds-first-power-tools|url-status=dead|archive-date=January 25, 2013|publisher=[[History (U.S. TV channel)|History]]|accessdate=Oct 4, 2011}}</ref> The global market for power tools is $33 billion (in 2016) and estimated to reach $46 billion in 2025.\n\n==Energy sources==\nCurrently, an electric motor is the most popular choice to power stationary tools, though in the past they were powered by windmills, water wheels, and steam.

When the differential access becomes integral to institutions, it becomes common practice, making it difficult to rectify. Eventually, this racism dominates public bodies, private corporations, public and private universities, and is reinforced by the actions of conformists and newcomers. Another difficulty in reducing institutionalized racism is that there is no sole, true identifiable perpetrator. When racism is built into the institution, it emerges as the collective action of the population.\n\nProfessor James M. Jones postulates three major types of racism: personally mediated, [[Internalized racism|internalized]], and institutionalized.<ref>Jones, J. M. (1997). ''Prejudice and Racism'' (2nd ed.). New York: McGraw-Hill.</ref> Personally mediated racism includes the specific social attitudes inherent to racially prejudiced action ([[bigotry|bigoted]] differential assumptions about abilities, motives, and the intentions of others according to), [[discrimination]] (the differential actions and behaviours towards others according to their race), [[stereotyping]], commission, and omission (disrespect, suspicion, devaluation, and dehumanization). [[Internalized racism]] is the acceptance, by members of the racially [[stigmatized]] people, of negative perceptions about their own abilities and intrinsic worth, characterized by low [[self-esteem]], and low esteem of others like them. This racism can be manifested through embracing \"whiteness\" (e.g. [[Social stratification|stratification]] by skin colour in non-white communities), self-devaluation (e.g., racial slurs, nicknames, rejection of ancestral culture, etc.), and resignation, helplessness, and hopelessness (e.g., [[dropping out]] of school, [[abstention|failing to vote]], engaging in health-risk practices, etc.).\n\nPersistent negative [[stereotype]]s fuel institutional racism, and influence [[interpersonal relations]]. Racial stereotyping contributes to patterns of [[racial segregation#United States|racial residential segregation]] and [[redlining]], and shape views about crime, crime policy, and welfare policy, especially if the contextual information is stereotype-consistent.<ref>[http://www2.asanet.org/centennial/race_ethnicity_health.pdf Race, Ethnicity, and the Health of Americans.

One example of the difference is public school budgets in the U.S. (including local levies and bonds) and the quality of teachers, which are often correlated with property values: rich neighborhoods are more likely to be more 'white' and to have better teachers and more money for education, even in public schools. [[restrictive covenants|Restrictive housing contracts]] and bank lending policies have also been listed as forms of institutional racism. Other examples sometimes described as institutional racism are [[racial profiling]] by security guards and police, use of stereotyped racial caricatures, the under- and misrepresentation of certain racial groups in the [[mass media]], and race-based barriers to gainful employment and professional advancement. Additionally, differential access to goods, services, and opportunities of society can be included within the term ''institutional racism'', such as unpaved streets and roads, inherited socio-economic disadvantage, and \"standardized\" tests (each ethnic group prepared for it differently; many are poorly prepared).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.aaup.org/article/why-standardized-tests-have-standardized-postracial-ideology#.W7JDamhKjIU|title=Why Standardized Tests Have Standardized Postracial Ideology {{!}} AAUP|website=aaup.org|language=en|access-date=2018-10-01}}</ref>\n\nSome [[sociology|sociological]]<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.strategicpractice.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/GPP_4FacesOfPower.pdf | title=The Four Faces of Power | last=Healey | first=Richard | last2=Hinson| first2=Sandra}}</ref> investigators distinguish between institutional racism and \"structural racism\" (sometimes called structured [[racialization]]).<ref>[http://kirwaninstitute.osu.edu/docs/NewSR-brochure-FINAL.pdf Kirwan Institute brochure]</ref> The former focuses upon the norms and practices within an institution, the latter upon the ''interactions'' among institutions, interactions that produce [[racialized]] outcomes against non-white people.<ref name=\"esdc.gc.ca\">{{cite web|url=http://www.esdc.gc.ca/eng/communities/reports/poverty_profile/snapshot.shtml|title=Snapshot of racialized Poverty in Canada|accessdate=12 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161211143715/http://www.esdc.gc.ca/eng/communities/reports/poverty_profile/snapshot.shtml|archive-date=11 December 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> An important feature of structural racism is that it cannot be reduced to individual [[prejudice]] or to the single function of an institution.\n\n== United States ==\n\n=== In housing and loan ===\n[[File:NOLA16Sep13 Iberville Fence.JPG|thumb|Iberville Housing Projects in New Orleans, Louisiana]]\nInstitutional racism in the housing sector can be seen as early as the 1930s with the [[Home Owners' Loan Corporation]].

These neighborhoods tended to be African American neighborhoods, whereas white-middle-class Americans were able to receive housing loans.

A settlement with the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Dept]] and the [[Consumer Financial Protection Bureau]] was the largest in the history of both agencies, topping $33 million in restitution for the practice from New Jersey's largest savings bank. The bank had been accused of steering clear of minority neighborhoods and favoring white suburban borrowers in granting loans and mortgages, finding that of the approximately 1900 mortgages made in 2014 only 25 went to black applicants. The banks' executives denied bias, and the settlement came with adjustments to the banks business practices. This followed other successful efforts by the federal, state and city officials in 2014 to expand lending programs directed at minorities, and in some cases to force banks to pay penalties for patterns of redlining in Providence, R.I.; St. Louis, Mo.; Milwaukee, WI.; Buffalo and Rochester, N.Y.  The Justice Dept also has more active redlining investigations underway,<ref>Rachel Witkowski (8 May 2015).

''National Mortgage News''.</ref> and officials have stated to reporters that \"redlining is not a thing of the past\". It has evolved into a more politically correct version, where bankers do not talk about denying loans to blacks openly. The justice department officials noted that some banks have quietly institutionalized bias in their operations. They have moved their operations out of minority communities entirely, while others have moved in to fill the void and compete for clients. Such management decisions are not the stated intent, it is left unspoken so that even the bank's other customers are unaware that it is occurring. The effect on minority communities can be profound as home ownership, a prime source of neighborhood stability and economic mobility can affect its vulnerability to blight and disrepair. In the 1960s and 1970s laws were passed banning the practice; its return is far less overt, and while the vast majority of banks operate legally, the practice appears to be more widespread as the investigation revealed a vast disparity in loans approved for blacks vs whites in similar situations.<ref>Long banned, mortgage bias returns as issue, ''New York Times'' article, Saturday, October 1, 2015, pg 1</ref>\n\nStudies in major cities such as Los Angeles and Baltimore show that communities of color have lower levels of access to parks and green space.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Wolsh|first1=Jennifer|last2=Wilson|first2=John P.|last3=Fehrenbach|first3=Jed|title=Parks and Park Funding in Los Angeles: An Equity Mapping Analysis|url=http://lusk.usc.edu/sites/default/files/working_papers/Wolch.parks_.pdf|website=University of Southern California}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Boone|first1=Christopher|last2=Buckley|first2=Geoffrey|last3=Grove|first3=J.

The Justice Dept, following a 20-month investigation based on 33,000 cases over three years, reported that black youths were treated more harshly than whites and that all low-income youths, regardless of race, were deprived of their basic constitutional rights. Youths who encountered law enforcement got little or no chance to challenge detention or get any help from lawyers. With only one public defender assigned to juveniles in a county of one million, that legal aide handled 394 cases in 2014. The investigation was unrelated to the notorious case which roiled St. Louis, beginning before the police shooting of the unarmed black youth.<ref>{{cite web|last=Grossman |first=Andrew |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/ferguson-police-accused-of-racial-bias-by-federal-investigation-1425411657 |title=Ferguson Police, Courts Accused of Racial Bias by Justice Department Probe |publisher=WSJ |date=2015-03-03 |accessdate=2015-10-26}}</ref> The failure to grant access to counsel brought to light the practice of an informal process which could let offenders off with a warning or having them enter into diversion programs in lieu of  being charged in court. But to be accepted into the informal process, offenders had to admit to guilt, which runs afoul of the right not to incriminate oneself in criminal proceedings. The investigation following Michael Brown's shooting found an enormous disparity in the way juvenile cases were handled, with blacks being 47% more likely than whites to be put through the formal criminal proceedings. It also found them more likely to be held in detention, and also subsequently sentenced to incarceration once the case was finished. They were also more likely to be detained for violating parole from a previous case.<ref>\"The US finds racial Bias in a court in Missouri\", ''New York Times'' August 1, 2015, Nat'l news</ref>\n\nThe county did not cooperate fully with the Justice Dept and the St. Louis Family Court declined to comment, as did the state court system, of which it is a part.

In most state courts, the public defender's office decides who is poor enough to merit representation; in St. Louis Family Court the judge or court commissioner, sometimes based on different standards, decides who gets access to counsel. Most troubling to the justice official was the continuing use of court officials to recite complicated statutory language about the alleged crimes, then leading the defendants through \"formulaic 'do you understand' and yes/no questions.\" Judges made no effort to find out if the pleas were coerced, whether the child had any criminal intent or especially, did they fully understand the consequences of pleading guilty to the charges. Their competency to take part in their own defense was never established and the legal aide in the cases examined never challenged a probable cause finding, hired an expert witness or challenged hearsay evidence or leading questions and most cases ended with the child pleading guilty. The Civil Rights Division (of  the Justice Dept) began four investigations beginning in 2013 delving into juvenile justice systems in Miss., Tenn., Texas, and Missouri and while settlements were reached it has had to file suit to overcome the disparities in criminal convictions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/doj-report-critical-st-louis-county-family-court-32805053 |title=U.S. News &#124; National News - ABC News |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date=2015-10-16 |accessdate=2015-10-26}}</ref>\n\nCoupled with [[zero-tolerance]] discipline in schools, a \"one size fits all solution\" decried by the [[American Bar Association]], black and Latino youth are more likely to encounter negative contact with law enforcement and accrue violations, which leads to fines and failure to pay, which in turn leads to warrants and/or probation violations.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/04/opinion/schoolkids-in-handcuffs.html|title=Schoolkids in Handcuffs|last=The Editorial Board|date=4 November 2015|accessdate=15 June 2017|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref> This cycle has been shown to put children, particularly low-income minorities, in the [[school-to-prison pipeline]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.aclu.org/fact-sheet/what-school-prison-pipeline |title=What is the School-to-Prison Pipeline? &#124; American Civil Liberties Union |publisher=Aclu.org |date=2008-03-11 |accessdate=2015-10-26}}</ref>\n\n====Judicial misconduct====\n{{See also|Judicial misconduct}}\n\nIn 2010, two Washington state supreme court justices, Richard Sanders and James Johnson, were baffled at a court meeting to determine the fate of $25,000 in funding for various boards and commissions. They stated that there was too much African American representation in the prison population because African Americans are known to commit a number crimes and not because of their race. A black lawyer says she was shocked to hear two justices, [[Richard B. Sanders]] and Johnson, refer to a former legal aid lawyer's assertions in a report using the phrase ''poverty pimp''. Shirley Bondon, a state Administrative Office of the Courts (AOC) manager who oversaw court programs critical of the legal system, told the justices that she believed there was racial \"bias in the criminal-justice system, from the bottom up.\" The response from Justice Saunders was critical of blacks, stating that he didn't believe the barriers existed, except for poverty because it might restrict the ability to afford an attorney. [[James M. Johnson (judge)|James M. Johnson]], who was noted as the most conservative judge on the court, agreed, noting that African Americans commit them [crimes] against their own communities, to which Bondon objected, requesting a closed-door meeting with the court.

The men were subsequently released based on a pre-trial motion from the defense, claiming that the federal government had no basis for charging them, as no federal law was broken. Arizona officials never initiated criminal proceedings in state court against those responsible for the deportation of workers and their lost wages and other losses. The Justice Department appealed, but in [[United States v. Wheeler (1920)|United States v. Wheeler]], 254 U.S. 281 (1920), Chief Justice [[Edward Douglass White]] wrote for an 8-to-1 majority that the U.S. Constitution did not empower the federal government to enforce the rights of the deportees. Rather it \"necessarily assumed the continued possession by the states of the reserved power to deal with free residence, ingress, and egress.\" Only in a case of \"state discriminatory action\" would the federal government have a role to play. By this calculated reasoning, the officials situated at the Supreme Court erred in not taking the side that in today's legal lexicon had every right to seek justice and redress, not only for the stolen wages, union busting, false imprisonment and other crimes, but for the inherent right not to be forcibly removed from your home by men with guns and shipped in cattle cars across state lines as many homeowners were. That 8 of the 9 supreme court justices concurred and based on anti-radical speech sentiment at the time (post WWI anti-union and IWW)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://depts.washington.edu/antiwar/WW1_reds.shtml |title=World War I antiwar movement |publisher=Depts.washington.edu |date= |access-date=2015-10-26}}</ref> leads to the conclusion that the government gave the company cover to remove the workers, many of whom were Mexicans advocating for better pay and working condition, to a place in the next state closer to the border with the admonition ''never to return''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.desertexposure.com/200707/200707_wobblies.php|title=Desert Exposure Wobblies July 2007|author=|date=|website=DesertExposure.com|access-date=15 June 2017}}</ref> That few deportees returned and those that contested the deportations lost their cases to have their homes returned to [[Necessity (criminal law)|necessity]], and that in 1966 Finally, in [[United States v.

Mitchell Palmer]] and others advocated for a peacetime equivalent of the [[Sedition Act of 1918|Sedition Act]], using the Bisbee events as a justification. They stated that the only reason the company representatives and local law enforcement had taken the law into their own hands was that the government lacked the power to suppress radical sentiment directly. If the government was armed with appropriate legislation and the threat of long prison terms, private citizens would not feel the need to act. Writing in 1920, Harvard Professor [[Zechariah Chafee]] mocked that view: \"Doubtless some governmental action was required to protect pacifists and extreme radicals from mob violence, but incarceration for a period of twenty years seems a very queer kind of protection.<ref>Zechariah Chafee, Jr., Freedom of Speech (NY: Harcourt, Brace, and Howe, 1920), 45-46.</ref> That this was considered [[vigilante]] actions by private citizens duly deputized by the local sheriff gives no weight to the racist component directed towards those of Mexican descent in Arizona, New Mexico, and  Texas, who were being systematically forced from their homes in the US beginning in 1910.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/pqmyk|title=Mexican Americans and Repatriation|date=|work=tshaonline.org|accessdate=26 October 2015}}</ref>\n\n====Lynching of people of Mexican Descent====\n\n{{Main|Porvenir massacre (1918)}}\nVigilante actions against Mexicans in the southwest had been documented from the 1850s to 1930s of men, women and children, many of them American citizens; who were burned, shot, hung, whipped or mutilated due to racist terror. Thousands were killed by white settlers and gold prospectors to drive them off their land or steal their claims using false charges to gin up mob actions. Many of the killings took place in front of hundreds who encouraged mobs to remove the men from jails to lynch them. In Texas the [[Texas Ranger Division|Rangers]] were implicated by archeological digs at the sites of one of the massacres that took place near the U.S. Army razed village of Porvenir near the Mexican border in Marfa, Texas.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rimrockpress.com/blog/index.php?entry=entry151216-162435|title=PORVENIR MASSACRE ARCHAEOLOGY MOST REVEALING|last=Justice|first=Glenn|date=2017-04-21|website=Glenn's Texas History Blog|access-date=}}</ref> Many of the state sanctioned killings which occurred in Texas have been removed from public view and recent efforts to increase awareness have been stymied by state commissions on historic places.

She was later over-ruled by the head of the State Historical Commission, who brokered a deal to also erect markers at Anglo ranches that were victims of suspected Mexican [[Villistas]], which may also have been a response to the extrajudicial killings by the Rangers and Ranchers.<ref>\"1919 Ranger Investigation\".

Strikers became targets of [[agent provocateurs]] who infiltrated meetings of \"communist labor\" and anti-war activists. After the Bisbee deportations became exposed in the press, Americans were divided about the treatment of illegal aliens, who were purported communists. Former President Theodore Roosevelt opined in the press that the Bisbee miners \"had it coming, as they were hell-bent on havoc!\" The Dept of Justice went from advocating for persons deprived of rights and liberty by state actors to detaining them under dubious warrants and suspicion of radicalism. The [[First Red Scare|Red Scare]] that fueled institutional racism in the 1920s against Russian Jews and other Eastern European immigrants was a backlash to the 1917 Bolshevik revolution in Russia and a [[1919 United States anarchist bombings|bombing campaign]]  early in 1919 by Italian anarchists advocating the overthrow of the government. The result was the infamous [[Palmer raids]], ostensibly a deportation measure to remove dangerous aliens. In 1919 Attorney General [[A. Mitchell Palmer]] began a series of raids cooked up to remove radicals and anarchists from the US. Warrants were requested from compliant officials in the [[United States Department of Labor|Labor Dept]], and a number of foreign nationals caught up in the sweeping raids were eventually deported. As only the department of labor had the legal right to deport aliens, they did object to the methods; nevertheless, under [[color of law]], the raids began on November 7, 1919. It was led by a 24-year-old [[J. Edgar Hoover]]  heading a new division of the Justice Department's [[Bureau of Investigation]], called the General Intelligence Division. Armed with responsibility for investigating the programs of radical groups and identifying their members, the raids began with agents of the Bureau of Investigation, together with local police, executing a series of well-publicized and violent raids against the [[Union of Russian Workers]] in 12 cities.\n\nNewspaper accounts reported some were \"badly beaten\" during the arrests. Many later swore they were threatened and beaten during questioning. Government agents cast a wide net, bringing in some American citizens, passers-by who admitted being Russian, some not members of the Russian Workers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/toamericanpeople00natiuoft/toamericanpeople00natiuoft_djvu.txt|title=Full text of \"To the American people; report upon the illegal practices of the United States Department of justice\"|date=|work=archive.org|accessdate=26 October 2015}}</ref> Others were teachers conducting night school classes in space shared with the targeted radical groups. Arrests far exceeded the number of warrants. Of 650 arrested in New York City, the government managed to deport just 43. Hoover organized the next raids. He successfully persuaded the Department of Labor to ease its insistence on promptly alerting those arrested of their right to an attorney. Instead, Labor issued instructions that its representatives could wait until after the case against the defendant was established, \"in order to protect government interests.\"<ref name=\"proprocedure.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.proprocedure.com/labor_history/content8.php|title=Labor History|date=|work=proprocedure.com|accessdate=26 October 2015}}</ref> Less openly, Hoover decided to interpret Labor's agreement to act against the Communist Party to include a different organization, the [[Communist Labor Party of America|Communist Labor Party]]. Finally, despite the fact that Secretary of Labor [[William B. Wilson]] insisted that more than membership in an organization was required for a warrant, Hoover worked with more compliant Labor officials and overwhelmed Labor staff to get the warrants he wanted. Justice Department officials, including Palmer and Hoover, later claimed ignorance of such details.\n\nThe Justice Department launched a series of raids on January 2, 1920, with follow-up operations over the next few days. Smaller raids extended over the next six weeks. At least 3,000 were arrested, and many others were held for various lengths of time. The entire enterprise replicated the November action on a larger scale, including arrests and seizures without search warrants, as well as detention in overcrowded and unsanitary holding facilities. Hoover later admitted \"clear cases of brutality\". Some cases in Boston included torture, where detainees were placed in a 'hot box' above a furnace and given one glass of water and a slice of bread a day and kept there for 50 hours. The raids covered more than 30 cities and towns in 23 states, but those west of the Mississippi and south of Ohio were \"publicity gestures\" designed to make the effort appear nationwide in scope. Because the raids targeted entire organizations, agents arrested everyone found in organization meeting halls, not only arresting non-radical organization members but also visitors who did not belong to a target organization, and sometimes American citizens not eligible for arrest and deportation. In a few weeks, after changes in personnel at the Department of Labor, Palmer faced a new and very independent-minded Acting Secretary of Labor in Assistant Secretary of Labor [[Louis Freeland Post]], who canceled more than 2,000 warrants as being illegal. Of the 10,000 arrested, 3,500 were held by authorities in detention; 556 resident aliens were eventually deported under the [[Immigration Act of 1918]].\nAt a Cabinet meeting in April 1920, Palmer called on Secretary of Labor Wilson to fire Post, but Secretary Wilson defended him. The President listened to his feuding department heads and offered no comment about Post, but he ended the meeting by telling Palmer that he should \"not let this country see red.\" Secretary of the Navy [[Josephus Daniels]], who made notes of the conversation, thought the Attorney General had merited the President's \"admonition,\" because Palmer \"was seeing red behind every bush and every demand for an increase in wages.\"<ref name=\"Shogan2013\">{{cite book|last=Shogan|first=Robert|title=The Battle of Blair Mountain: The Story of America's Largest Labor Uprising|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IVmypbQvHwAC&pg=PA62|date=20 August 2013|publisher=Basic Books|isbn=978-0-7867-3594-5|pages=62\u2013}}</ref>\n\n=====Other=====\nOn May 28, 1920, the [[American Civil Liberties Union|ACLU]] published its \"Report Upon the Illegal Practices of the United States Department of Justice\",<ref>{{cite web | url=http://debs.indstate.edu/n277t6_1920.pdf | title=Report Upon the Illegal Practices of the United States Department of Justice | publisher=ACLU | date=May 28, 1920}}</ref> which carefully documented the Justice Department's unlawful activities in arresting suspected radicals, illegal entrapment by [[agents provocateurs]], and unlawful incommunicado detention.

Many other minorities also suffered from institutional racism. One example is immigration policies against Chinese. The intensified job competition during the 1870s on the West Coast between Chinese workers and Whites invoked anti-Chinese movement. The first Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 was passed to prohibit Chinese immigrating to the United States, resulting in only 10 Chinese immigrants into the U.S. in 1887. The labor shortage after the decline of Chinese immigrant labor proved the fact of White racism.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Racism, sexism, and the media|last = Wilson|first = Clint|publisher = Sage|year =2013 |isbn = |location = |pages = 60\u201361|last2 = Gutierrez|last3 = Chao}}</ref> For more information, see [[History of Chinese Americans]].

In 1954 while the [[Bracero program]] was in force, the [[Immigration and Naturalization Service|INS]] used force to repatriate 1 million Mexicans. It was a system of tactical control and cooperation within the U.S. Border Patrol and alongside the Mexican government and was called [[Operation Wetback]]. With the growing diplomatic and security issues surrounding illegal border crossings, the INS increased its raids and apprehensions beginning in the early 1950s leading up to Operation Wetback. Those apprehended were often deported without the opportunity to recover their property in the US or contact family and were stranded without food or employment when they entered Mexico. Deported Mexicans faced extreme conditions and were sometimes left in the desert; 88 deported workers died in 112-degree heat in July 1955. Most were sent by ship to [[Veracruz (city)|Veracruz]] or transported by land to southern Mexican cities. During the entirety of the Operation, border recruitment of illegal workers by American growers continued due largely to the inexpensiveness of illegal labor and the desire of growers to avoid the bureaucratic obstacles of the Bracero program; the continuation of illegal immigration despite the efforts of Operation Wetback was largely responsible for the failure of the program.<ref>Kevin Starr, [https://books.google.com/books?id=7GvgN0y7yI4C&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false Endangered Dreams: The Great Depression in California] (1997) p. 261. {{ISBN|0195118022}}</ref>\n\nIn 2006, the House of Representatives congresspersons [[Hilda Solis]] and [[Luis Gutierrez]] called for an apology from the U.S. Government for the Repatriation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/2006-04-04-1930s-deportees-cover_x.htm|title=U.S. urged to apologize for 1930s deportations - USATODAY.com|accessdate=12 July 2015}}</ref> This has not occurred to date.

Authorized at the federal level in 1871, it came about due to reforms of the [[spoils system]] in place since the 1830s, and abuses of the post-Civil War era, when Congress authorized the president to appoint a Civil Service Commission and prescribe regulations for admission to public service. A dis-satisfied office-seeker assassinated President Garfield in 1881 and Congress was motivated to pass the [[Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act]] in 1883 which firmly established civil service. During reconstruction, this enabled the federal government to provide jobs for newly freed blacks in the south (primarily the Postal Service) where no other employment opportunities existed for them. Since the inception of the merit system in 1881, the numbers of blacks in federal civil service positions rose from 0.057 to 5.6% by 1910.

This was replaced in turn by institutional racism, the practice of upholding the letter of the law, but not the spirit, in an effort to prevent minority hires from gaining ground in titles where they were disproportionately underrepresented, such as Police and Fire depts, and in management positions.<ref>{{cite web |first1=Cynthia |last1=Brown |first2=Jack |last2=Maskell |title=Hatch Act Restrictions on Federal Employees' Political Activities in the Digital Age |url=http://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R44469.pdf |work=[[Congressional Research Service]] |page=4 |date=April 13, 2016 |accessdate= December 16, 2017}}</ref>\n\n====Post-integration period====\n\nAround the country in the 1950s, blacks found common cause in challenging [[employment discrimination]], and the colored newspapers took up the cause. Economically, jobs were becoming scarce for minorities during the post-war years as returning servicemen reclaimed the manufacturing and factory base. Civil Service looked to be a reasonable alternative to blacks returning from WWII service overseas and black officers leaving the newly desegregated armed services.  In Los Angeles in the 1950s, the [[NAACP]] fueled an integration campaign in the [[California Eagle]] and petitioned the fire commission to provide more jobs in the LAFD. When the Fire Chief Engineer John Alderson attempted to integrate the department, the resistance to integration created so-called 'Hate Houses' and resulted in the formation of [[The Stentorians]] as a protective force of guardians to protect minority firefighters. New York had previously experienced their own revelations when the [[Vulcan Society]] appeared before the city council and demanded the elimination of 'the black bed' in firehouses for the black firemen. At that hearing in 1944, the NYC council chambers filled with FDNY brass on one side and black firefighters protesting the lack of promotional opportunities and racial harassment on the other.\n\nWith that as the backdrop, integration began and segregation was replaced by institutional racism, which took the form much the same way it did when blacks first got hired before and during WWI. Blacks once appointed to a civil service position were subjected to isolation, ostracism, outright hostility and separate quarters. After 1956, the first black hires to the LAFD after integration unfairly failed to finish academy training. The Vulcan Society in New York mentored many blacks but progress was slow, with hiring not reflected in mirroring the population of the cities served until the passage of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] when the numbers of minority hiring increased. The [[U.S. Department of Labor]] in the 1970s began enforcing racial quotas during the Nixon administration that mandated black hiring, but it was the lawsuits of the 1970s which exploded the imposition of Consent Decrees across the country forcing the diversity of the hard to integrate titles. In 1971 the [[Vulcan Blazers]] of the Baltimore, Maryland fire dept filed a groundbreaking lawsuit that resulted in the appointment of blacks to positions of officers up to assistant chief when the court ruled there had been discrimination in promotions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2011-12-06/html/CREC-2011-12-06-pt1-PgE2184-3.htm|title=Congressional Record, Volume 157 Issue 186 (Tuesday, December 6, 2011)|accessdate=12 July 2015}}</ref> Other minority groups followed their lead and also took to the courts. In 2009 the City of Baltimore paid $4.6 Million to settle a case of discrimination filed by minority policemen alleging discrimination. As other recent lawsuits have proved, civil departments have held their heads responsible for cases of institutional racism, an example of which is the case in 2007 of the LAFD Chief, [[William Bamattre]],<ref>AP, December 2, 2006 http://www.lafire.com/fire_chiefs/1996-WilliamBamattre/2006-1202_AP_LAFireChiefRetiresAmidFuror.htm</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lafire.com/fire_chiefs/1996-WilliamBamattre/2006-1202_AP_LAFireChiefRetiresAmidFuror.htm|title=\"L.A.

W. Bush]] attempted to eliminate [[affirmative action]] during his term of office. He ordered the use of quotas, preferences, set-asides on the basis of race, sex, religion or national origin be abolished in hiring. Congress responded with the [[Civil Rights Act of 1991]], which only covered the terms for settling cases where discrimination had previously been confirmed. It had been near impossible to prove a case of [[institutional discrimination]] in the courts,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/491/164|title=Patterson v. McLean Credit Union|accessdate=12 July 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/06/16/us/excerpts-from-opinions-on-scope-of-rights-act.html|title=Excerpts From Opinions on Scope of Rights Act|first=Special To The New York|last=Times|date=16 June 1989|accessdate=15 June 2017|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref> and many other cases were terminated upon imposition of a [[consent decree]]. While President [[George H. W. Bush]]'s attempt failed, it fueled the rise in 1996 of the [[California Proposition 209]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/02/13/california-affirmative-action-ban-proposition-209_n_1274448.html|title=California Affirmative Action Ban, Proposition 209, Challenged in Court|work=The Huffington Post|accessdate=12 July 2015}}</ref> a ballot initiative abolishing affirmative action in California universities, to counteract what Institutionalized Racism. [[Affirmative action]] is where members of a minority group get preferential treatment over the majority rather than being treated as equals. This closed down the avenues [[affirmative action]] initiatives had opened for blacks to have race counted as a factor when accounting for different rates of acceptance to Universities and consequently in employment discrimination lawsuits that sought redress from discriminatory hiring. This is where the arguments for redress for past wrongs under the 'catchup provisions' no longer worked in favor of claimants.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/dec/03/news/mn-50304|title=Judge Upholds Key Affirmative Action Laws|work=latimes|accessdate=12 July 2015}}</ref> Proposition 209 has withstood challenges but in 2013 the California Senate passed Amendment #5 \u2013 which if implemented would have reversed 209 had its main sponsor in the Senate not retracted it before final passage. By 2014 the UCLA Board of Regents came out publicly against 209 after reviewing the loss of minorities in university admissions after 209 was implemented.\n\nThese ballot initiatives spread around the country primarily in [[red states]]. In 2003 the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] had ruled on affirmative action programs at the [[University of Michigan]] in ''[[Gratz v. Bollinger]]'' and [[Grutter v. Bollinger]]; the rulings found the affirmative action program was unconstitutional for the way it was applied, but ambiguously said it could continue to use affirmative action. This strengthened the campaign against racial preferences and proponents pressed ahead with more ballot initiatives under the theory that affirmative action programs were no longer needed. The tide against further passage of such discriminatory ballot box institutional racism didn't abate until the 2008 election cycle when efforts by [[Ward Connerly]], the chairman of the [[American Civil Rights Institute]], a national non-profit organization founded to oppose racial and gender preferences,<ref name=\"acri\">{{cite web |title=About the American Civil Rights Institute |url=http://acri.org/about-acri/|work=American Civil Rights Institute |accessdate=2009-04-28 }}</ref> failed to get ballot measures passed in 3 states, was rejected by voters in another, and only in Nebraska got passage to add one last state banning affirmative action as a remedy for past discrimination. His critics condemned Connerly's reasoning, saying he failed to see the extent of past racism on African Americans and Hispanics; and that contemporary institutionalized racism is pervasive and powerful, and that affirmative action can overcome the residual effects of past institutional racism on people of color. Advocates of [[Affirmative Action]] programs denied that these were '[[racial quotas]]' as that was seen as divisive and under [[color of law]], but affirmative action goals fell to this onslaught and subsequent [[reverse discrimination]] lawsuits ended the practice. Connerly, for his part, stated \"I think that in some quarters, many parts of the country, a white male is really disadvantaged ... Because we have developed this notion of women and minorities being so disadvantaged and we have to help them, that we have, in many cases, twisted the thing so that it's no longer a case of equal opportunity. It's a case of putting a fist on the scale.\"<ref name=\"Attack\">{{cite news |title=Attacking Affirmative Action |date=August 29, 2008 |work=NOW on PBS |publisher=PBS |url=https://www.pbs.org/now/shows/434/index.html |accessdate=2009-04-28 }}</ref> His [[multi-racial]] background caused conservatives to back his cause as he was perceived to be both black and anti-affirmative action.\n\n=== In education ===\n[[Standardized testing]] has also been considered a form of institutional racism, because it is believed to be biased in favor of people from particular socio-cultural backgrounds. Some minorities have consistently tested worse than whites on virtually all standardized tests, even after controlling for socioeconomic status, while others have tested consistently better. The cause of the achievement gaps between black, Hispanic, white and Asian students has yet to be fully elucidated.\n\n==== In higher education ====\nIn the 1960s, students of color started attending colleges and universities in record numbers after the passage of the Civil Rights and Higher Education Acts.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.aft.org/news/preserving-civil-rights-higher-education-act|title=Preserving civil rights in the Higher Education Act|date=2018-04-30|work=American Federation of Teachers|access-date=2018-09-30|language=en}}</ref> However, the obstacles of integration in predominantly white institutions of higher education led to unforeseen obstacles for faculty and students of color working and studying in such environments. According to a review of educational research, tension and violence followed, one reason being the lack of preparedness of many colleges and universities to teach a diversity of students.<ref name=\"Engberg\">{{cite journal|year=2004|title=Improving Intergroup Relations in Higher Education: A Critical Examination of the Influence of Educational Interventions on Racial Bias|url=|journal=American Educational Research Association|volume=74|issue=4|pages=473\u2013524|doi=10.3102/00346543074004473|last1=Engberg|first1=M.

Board of Education]] was ruled in 1954, actual integration did not completely occur until many years later; the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] held multiple hearings on the desegregation of schools, continuously they maintained that [[Brown v.

The underlying issue of minority presence of college campuses occurs. In 2008, the [[National Center for Education Statistics]] reported that while enrollment of minorities and students of color had risen, white enrollment still held the majority on average, accounting for 63 percent of undergraduate college and university students.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nces.ed.gov/pubs2010/2010015/indicator6_24.asp|title=Status and Trends in the Education of Racial and Ethnic Minorities|website=nces.ed.gov|language=EN|access-date=2018-10-14}}</ref> While this varies based on the region, state, and elite status, in general the majority of colleges and universities in the United States are predominantly white. According to the [[U.S. Department of Education,]] there has also been a rise in hate crimes on college campuses; 1250 hate crimes in 2016, up 25 percent from 2015.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.chronicle.com/article/After-2016-Election-Campus/242577|title=After 2016 Election, Campus Hate Crimes Seemed to Jump.

According to the [[U.S. Department of Education,]] being prepared for college is integral to whether or not a student is successful.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www2.ed.gov/offices/OPE/AgenProj/report/theme1a.html|title=ED.gov|website=www2.ed.gov|access-date=2018-10-14}}</ref> While the government offers college preparation programs for minority and low-income students, programs such as [[GEAR UP]] and [[Federal TRIO Programs]] help prepare students for college to better ensure their success and retention,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www2.ed.gov/programs/gearup/index.html|title=Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Programs (GEAR UP)|date=2018-06-08|website=www2.ed.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-10-14}}</ref> the access to these programs is relatively limited. While programs such as [[Federal TRIO Programs]] have grown since conception, there is still work that needs to be done if more minority students are expected to attend and succeed in a post-secondary institution. Due to availability of [[Federal TRIO Programs]] being subjective based on where geographically a student may be, the benefits are not completely being felt be the targeted communities. However, the positive effects of [[Federal TRIO Programs]] have been pretty bolstering\u2014more minorities and low-income individuals are prepared when going to post-secondary institutions.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.rti.org/impact/analysis-support-federal-trio-programs|title=Analysis Support for the Federal TRIO Programs|date=2016-06-10|work=RTI|access-date=2018-10-14|language=en}}</ref>\n\nInstitutionalized racism in higher education has received little national attention, even though it is a relevant issue affecting many colleges and universities. Despite efforts to improve the situation on college and university campuses, such as implementing [[affirmative action]] plans, anti-black racism and violence continue to occur.<ref>https://www.researchgate.net/profile/William_Smith57/publication/247752199_Assume_the_Position_You_Fit_the_Description_Psychosocial_Experiences_and_Racial_Battle_Fatigue_Among_African_American_Male_College_Students/links/54ef02da0cf2e55866f3daf4/Assume-the-Position-You-Fit-the-Description-Psychosocial-Experiences-and-Racial-Battle-Fatigue-Among-African-American-Male-College-Students.pdf</ref> The effects of this violence extend beyond the incident itself.

Aside from the media, one source that can be used to keep up to date on institutional racism in higher education is ''[[The Journal of Blacks in Higher Education]]'' (JBHE). This journal aims to provide as much information as possible about anti-black institutional racism. JBHE publishes resources, statistics, and current reports of race-related actions on college and university campuses.<ref name=\":04\" /> For example, JBHE reported on the [[2015 University of Oklahoma Sigma Alpha Epsilon racism incident]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.jbhe.com/2015/03/video-shows-university-of-oklahoma-students-singing-racist-song/|title=Video Shows University of Oklahoma Students Singing Racist Song|date=2015-03-09|work=The Journal of Blacks in Higher Education|access-date=2017-03-14|language=en-US}}</ref> Other media resources where reports on racial incidents on college campuses can be found is [[Inside Higher Ed]] and [[Southern Poverty Law Center|the Southern Poverty Law Center]]\n\nIn 2016, the [[United States Department of Education|U.S. Department of Education]] released a report on crime in schools.

Universities and colleges that have identified diversity as one of their priorities should plan how to strategically and in a sensitive manner create a campus climate in which all students, in particular students of color in a PWI, do not have to risk feeling unsafe, discriminated against, marginalized or tokenized to obtain a post-secondary degree.\n\nData has shown that students of color and White students have different perceptions of campus racial climates. In a survey of 433 undergraduate students at one institution found that, in comparison to White students, students of color felt differently about campus policies. White students were more often to describe their campus racial climate as positive, while students of African descent rated it as negative. Findings indicate that students of color experience harassment that is, \"offensive, hostile, or intimidating\" at higher rates than White students, which interferes with their learning. Further, \"students of color perceived the climate as more racist and less accepting than did White students, even though White students recognized racial harassment at similar rates as students of color\".<ref name=\"rankin\" /> In addition, many African American students have a hard time to fit in a white predominant colleges because of the fear of \"becoming white.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Tyson|first1=Will|title=Social Segregation by Race at Predominantly White Universities|journal=Southern Sociological Society|date=2001|id={{ProQuest|61748890}}}}</ref>\n\nWhite students also felt more positive about their classroom experience and the way professors presented various viewpoints in the curriculum, about institutional policies as well as recruitment and retention of student of color. Students of African descent and other students of color felt the campus environment was not friendly and that they had been targets of racism. In another study of 5,000 first year students at 93 institutions, White students were more likely to agree with the statement that  \"racial discrimination is no longer a problem\" than students of color.<ref name=\"rankin\" /> White students were also more likely to feel that the campus climate is improving in comparison to students of color. White students felt the campus climate was non-racist, friendly, and respectful while students of color felt that it was racist, hostile, and disrespectful.<ref name=\"rankin\" /> Research has shown that racial diversification in colleges and universities, without intentional education about systemic racism and the history of race in the United States, can lead to creating a racial campus climate that is oppressive towards students of color.  There needs to be, \"intentional education interventions related to the changing racial composition of college students [which] would likely influence how the climate of an environment changes\".<ref name=\"rankin\" />\n\nIf institutional racism is to be addressed in institutes of higher education, different types of interventions need to be created, in particular, interventions created specifically for the academy. Rankin and Reason's research concluded that for intervention to be effective, faculty would need to be used as socializing agents on campus, in particular, because intellectual and behavioral norms on most campuses are set by faculty and, these norms have a heavy impact on campus climate.<ref name=\"rankin\" /> An example of students trying to change racial campus climate is the Being Black at the University of Michigan [[#BBUM]] moment. The Black Student Union is organizing and collaborating with organizations to bring attention to the racial climate at the [[University of Michigan]] and how it is affecting all students.<ref>Vega, T.

One example of this is required coursework through the departments of African/African-American Studies, Xicano studies, Asian-American studies, Arab American studies, and Native American studies alongside the History department.

Newly acquired freedom founded a growth in African American participation in politics. This period of increased African American participation, from 1867 to 1877, is known as [[Reconstruction Era|Radical Reconstruction]] or [[Black Reconstruction]].  Despite the increase in African American participation in politics, Radical Reconstruction is not mentioned as an example of how black politics strive to be. There are very distinct viewpoints concerning this time period.  \nSome believed that corruption had run rampart in the South with the introduction of newly freed slaves into legislation and a great deal of attention was given to the negativity that surrounded the introduction of black faces into government. The Reconstruction of South Carolina particularly was under scrutiny as the legislatures were predominantly black. The happenings in the South Carolina legislature were described negatively and seen as pro- black and significantly focused on issues that only pertained to blacks. Attention was solely focused on the misgivings occurring within legislature such as, \"unethical appropriation of state funds by members of the legislature\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ladenburg|first1=Thomas|last2=McFeely|first2=William|title=The Black Man in the Land of Equality|date=1969|publisher=Hayden Book Company Inc.|location=United States of America}}</ref> and other unethical and illegal acts committed by both black and white legislatures in South Carolina.  Another set of issues brought up was the multitude of expensive decorative items and embellishments that were purchased for the refurbishment of the State House.  White legislatures were generally left out of the criticisms, despite their own contributions, and were referred to as victims of corruption due to the influence of black people.\nOthers believed that Black Reconstruction was not to blame for all corruption in legislation.  This faction of people saw the constructive debates and conversations that flowed within the southern legislations.  They were also more receptive to the positive aspects and characteristics of black legislatures that were displayed during their time in office.\nDespite the amount of eager participants, this period eventually led to a decline in black participation in politics.  The backlash of those against increase of black participation in politics effectively began to cause the number of participants to stop and then decline.  Today, despite past involvement, black participation in politics is low.  Black participation is not a common occurrence in comparison to overall participation and is often celebrated when a black candidate or politician does particularly well in their political endeavors.  This decline is attributed to a white counterattack of the Black Reconstruction movement.  Many methods were used to dissuade blacks from taking office.  One of the most prominent was violence.  An example of that would be the Ku Klux Klan, a secretive group whose members all believed in white supremacy.  The lynching, beatings, and intimidation of black people helped to hasten the decline of black participation in politics. Coercion was also another method used to dissuade black participation in politics, particularly voting.  Threats of loss jobs and refusal of medical care are some of the coercion methods employed.  Coercion did not play as big of a role as direct physical violence however it did serve to further hinder the growth of black participation in politics.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ladenburg|first1=Thomas|last2=McFeely|first2=William|title=The Black Man in the Land of Equality|date=1969|publisher=Hayden Book Company, INC|location=New York|oclc=53860}}</ref>  These methods helped to forge a political system that has a scarce amount of minorities in office.\n\n==== Representation ====\nBlack representation in Congress had been scarce with less than eight Blacks in Congress per Congressional periods since the [[41st Congress|end of the Civil War]] up until the [[91st Congress|Nixon era]] when there were 11 Black representatives (ten in the House and one in the Senate).

This led to an emphasis on the acquisition of Aboriginal lands in exchange for the putative benefits of European society and their associated Christian religions. British control of Canada (the [[Monarchy of Canada|Crown]]) began when they exercised jurisdiction over the first nations and it was by Royal Proclamation that the first piece of legislation the British government passed over First Nations citizens assumed control of their lives. It gave recognition to the Indians tribes as First Nations living under Crown protection.\n\nIt was after the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|treaty of Paris In 1763]], whereby France ceded all claims in present-day Canada to Britain, that King George III of Great Britain issued this Royal Proclamation specifying how the Indigenous in the [[Monarchy of Canada|crown]] colony were to be treated. It is the most significant pieces of legislation regarding the [[Monarchy of Canada|Crown]]'s relationship with Aboriginal people. This Royal Proclamation recognized Indian owned lands and reserved to them all use as their hunting grounds. It also established the process by which the [[Monarchy of Canada|Crown]] could purchase their lands, and also laid out basic principles to guide the Crown when making treaties with the First Nations. The Proclamation made Indian lands transferred by treaty to be Crown property, and stated that indigenous title is a collective or communal rather than a private right so that individuals have no claim to lands where they lived and hunted long before the British came.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cidh.org/countryrep/Indigenous-Lands09/Chap.V-VI.htm|title=Indigenous and Tribal People's Rights Over Their Ancestral Lands and Natural Resources|author=|date=|website=cidh.org|accessdate=15 June 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Indian Acts===\n\nIn 1867, the [[British North America Acts|British North America Act]] made [[Indian Reserve (1763)|land reserved for Indians]] a [[Monarchy of Canada|Crown]]  responsibility.

Although a commission had been sent to Winnipeg to hear their claims previously, he noted \"that only a few were able to attend and that the others by reason of poverty and other causes were unable to do so.\" David Macarthur to Secretary, Department of Interior, 3 October 1885 (NAC RG 15, D-II-3, Vol. 178, File HB 1104).</ref>\n\nThere was no legislation binding scrip land to the [[M\u00e9tis people (Canada)|M\u00e9tis]] whom applied for them, Instead, M\u00e9tis scrip lands could be sold to anyone, hence alienating any Aboriginal title which may have been vested in those lands. Despite the evident detriment to the M\u00e9tis, speculation was rampant and done in collusion with the distribution of scrip.  While this does not necessarily preclude a malicious intent by the federal government to consciously 'cheat' the M\u00e9tis, it illustrates their apathy towards the welfare of the M\u00e9tis, their long-term interests, and the recognition of their Aboriginal title.  But the point of the policy was to settle land in the North-West with agriculturalists, not keep a land reserve for the M\u00e9tis. Scrip, then, was a major undertaking in Canadian history, and its importance as both an Aboriginal policy and a land policy should not be overlooked as it was an institutional 'policy' which discriminated against ethnic indigenous to their continued detriment.<ref>M\u00e9tis National Council, \"A Guide to the Northwest 'Half-breed' Scrip Applications Document Series,\" M\u00e9tis National Council Historical Online Database ({{cite web |url=http://tomcat.sunsite.ualberta.ca/MNC/learn.jsp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-07-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112083913/http://tomcat.sunsite.ualberta.ca/MNC/learn.jsp |archivedate=2013-11-12 }}, retrieved March 2008).</ref>\n\n===Enfranchisement===\n\nUntil 1951 the various Indian Acts defined a 'person' as \"an individual other than an Indian\", and all indigenous peoples were considered wards of the state. Legally, the Crown devised a system of [[Gradual Civilization Act|enfranchisement]] whereby an indigenous person could become a \"person\" in Canadian law. Indigenous people could gain the right to vote and become Canadian citizens, \"persons\" under the law, by voluntarily assimilating into European/Canadian society.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/An_Act_to_encourage_the_gradual_Civilization_of_the_Indian_Tribes_in_this_Province,_and_to_amend_the_Laws_respecting_Indians|title=An Act to encourage the gradual Civilization of the Indian Tribes in this Province, and to amend the Laws respecting Indians|via=Wikisource}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://eco.canadiana.ca/view/oocihm.9_07030|title=Bill : an act to encourage the gradual civiliza... - cover - Early Canadiana Online|author=Canadiana|date=|work=canadiana.ca|accessdate=26 October 2015}}</ref> \nIt was hoped that indigenous peoples would renounce their native heritage and culture and embrace the 'benefits' of civilized society. Indeed, from the 1920s to the 1940s some Natives did give up their status in order to receive the right to go to school, vote or to drink. However, voluntary enfranchisement proved a failure when few natives took advantage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://signatoryindian.tripod.com/routingusedtoenslavethesovereignindigenouspeoples/id10.html|title=2. 1857 - Gradual civilization of the Indian tribes- Enfranchisement Scheme|work=signatoryindian.tripod.com|accessdate=21 February 2018}}</ref>\nIn 1920 a law was passed to authorize enfranchisement without consent, and many Aboriginal peoples were involuntarily enfranchised. Natives automatically lost their Indian status under this policy and also if they became professionals such as doctors or ministers, or even if they obtained university degrees, and with it, their right to reside on the reserves.\n\nThe enfranchisement requirements particularly discriminated against Native women, specifying in Section 12 (1)(b) of the Indian Act that an Indian status woman marrying a non Indian man would lose her status as an Indian, as would her children. In contrast non Indian women marrying Indian men would gain Indian status.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://openparliament.ca/bills/41-1/C-31|title=Bill C-31 (Historical)|date=|work=openparliament.ca|accessdate=26 October 2015}}</ref>\n[[Duncan Campbell Scott]], the Deputy Superintendent of Indian Affairs, neatly expressed the sentiment of the day in 1920:\n\"Our object is to continue until there is not a single Indian in Canada that has not been absorbed into the body politic, and there is no Indian question and no Indian Department\"\nThis aspect of enfranchisement was addressed by passage of Bill C-31 in 1985,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://indigenousfoundations.web.arts.ubc.ca/bill_c-31/|title=Bill C-31|website=indigenousfoundations.web.arts.ubc.ca}}</ref> where the discriminatory clauses of the Indian Act was removed, and Canada officially gave up the goal of enfranchising Natives.\n\n===Residential schools===\n\nWith the goal of civilizing and Christianizing Aboriginal populations, a system of 'industrial schools' was developed in the 19th century which combined academic studies with \"more practical matters\" and schools for Natives began to appear in the 1840s. From 1879 on these schools were modelled after the [[Carlisle Indian Industrial School|Carlisle Indian School]] in Pennsylvania, whose motto was \"[[Kill the Indian, Save the Man|Kill the Indian in him and save the man]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://waynekspear.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/residential-schools.gif|title=Image of students|author=|date=|website=wordpress.com|accessdate=27 March 2018}}</ref> It was felt that the most effective weapon for \"killing the Indian\" in them, was to remove children from their Native supports and so Native children were taken away from their homes, their parent, their families, friends and communities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.culturalsurvival.org/publications/cultural-survival-quarterly/canada/indian-residential-school-truth-and-reconciliation-c|title=Indian Residential School Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada|work=Cultural Survival|accessdate=12 July 2015}}</ref>\nThe 1876 Indian Act gave the federal government responsibility for Native education and by 1910 residential schools dominated the Native education policy. The government provided funding to religious groups such as the Catholic, Anglican, United Church and Presbyterian churches to undertake Native education. By 1920, attendance by natives was made compulsory and there were 74 residential schools operating nationwide. Following the ideas of [[Clifford Sifton|Sifton]] and others like him, the academic goals of these schools were \"dumbed down\". As [[Duncan Campbell Scott]] stated at the time, they didn't want students that were \"made too smart for the Indian villages\":<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.danielnpaul.com/IndianResidentialSchools.html|title=Indian Residential Schools - Cultural Genocide|accessdate=12 July 2015}}</ref>\n\"To this end the curriculum in residential schools has been simplified and the practical instruction given is such as may be immediately of use to the pupil when he returns to the reserve after leaving school.\"\n\nThe funding the government provided was generally insufficient and often the schools ran themselves as \"self-sufficient businesses\", where 'student workers' were removed from class to do the laundry, heat the building or perform farm work. Dormitories were often poorly heated and overcrowded, and the food was less than adequately nutritious. A 1907 report, commissioned by [[Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada|Indian Affairs]], found that in 15 prairie schools there was a death rate of 24%.<ref name=\"waynekspear.com\">{{cite web|url=http://waynekspear.com/2010/03/10/indian-residential-schools-2/|title=Indian Residential Schools|work=Wayne K. Spear - Writer|accessdate=12 July 2015}}</ref> Indeed, a deputy superintendent general of Indian Affairs at the time commented:\n\"It is quite within the mark to say that fifty percent of the children who passed through these schools did not benefit from the education which they had received therein.\"\nWhile the death rate did decline in later years, death would remain a part of the residential school tradition. The author of that report to the [[Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada|BNA]], [[Peter Bryce|Dr. P.H. Bryce]], was later removed and in 1922 published a pamphlet<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/storyofnationalc00brycuoft#page/n5/mode/2up|title=The story of a national crime : being an appeal for justice to the Indians of Canada; the wards of the nation, our allies in the Revolutionary War, our brothers-in-arms in the Great War|accessdate=12 July 2015}}</ref> that came close to calling the governments indifference to the conditions of the Indians in the schools 'manslaughter'.<ref name=\"waynekspear.com\"/>\n\nThe worst aspect of Canada's residential schools, and that which anthropologists [[John Steckley|Steckley]] and Cummins said \"might readily qualify as the single-worst thing that Europeans did to Natives in Canada\" was the endemic abuses;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abebooks.com/book-search/author/steckley-john/signed|title=Steckley John, Signed|date=12 July 1981|accessdate=12 July 2015}}</ref> emotional, physical and sexual, for which they are now known.

Criminal and civil suits against the government and the churches began in the late 1980s and shortly thereafter the last residential school closed. By 2002 the number of lawsuits had passed 10,000. In the 1990s, beginning with the United Church, the churches that ran the residential schools began to issue formal apologies. And in 1998 the Canadian government issued the Statement of [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (Canada)|Reconciliation]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trc.ca/websites/trcinstitution/index.php?p=3|title=TRC|accessdate=12 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304082611/http://www.trc.ca/websites/trcinstitution/index.php?p=3|archive-date=4 March 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> and committed $350 million in support of a community-based healing strategy to address the healing needs of individuals, families and communities arising from the legacy of physical and sexual abuse at residential schools. The money was used to launch the Aboriginal Healing Foundation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ahf.ca|title=Announcements - Aboriginal Healing Foundation|accessdate=12 July 2015}}</ref>\n\n<!-- ===Conclusion===\n\nThe overt institutional racism of the past has clearly had a profoundly devastating and lasting effect on visible minorities and Aboriginal communities throughout Canada. European cultural norms have imposed themselves on Native populations in Canada, and Aboriginal communities continue to struggle with foreign systems of governance, of justice, of education, and of livelihood. Visible Minorities struggle with education, employment and negative contact with the legal system across Canada.\n\nPerhaps most palpable is the dysfunction and familial devastation caused by residential schools. Hutchins states;<ref name=\"tolerance.cz\"/> \"Many of those who attended residential schools have been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, suffering from such symptoms as panic attacks, insomnia, and uncontrollable or unexplainable anger. Many also suffer from alcohol or drug abuse, sexual inadequacy or addiction, the inability to form intimate relationships, and eating disorders. Three generations of Native parents lost out on learning important parenting skills usually passed on from parent to child in caring and nurturing home environments, and the abuse suffered by students of residential schools has begun a distressing cycle of abuse within many Native communities.\" The lasting legacy of residential schools is but only one facet of the problem.<ref>Canada's Forced Schooling of Aboriginal Children Was 'Cultural Genocide,' Report Finds\". NY Times. 2 June 2015. Retrieved 2 June 2015</ref>\n\nThe hutchins report continues; \"Aboriginal children continue to struggle with mainstream education in Canada. For some Indian students, English remains a second language, and many lack parents with sufficient education themselves to support them. Moreover, education in Canada is premised on a written tradition, quite different from the oral tradition of Native communities. For others, it is simply that they are ostracised for their 'otherness'; their manners, their attitudes, their speech or a hundred other things which mark them out as different. \nAboriginal populations continue to suffer from poor health. They have seven years less life expectancy than the overall Canadian population and almost twice as many infant deaths. While Canada as a nation routinely ranks in the top three on the United Nations Human Development Index,<ref>http://hdr.undp.org/sites/default/files/reports/270/hdr_2010_en_complete_reprint.pdf</ref> its on-reserve Aboriginal population, if scored as a nation, would rank a distant and shocking sixty-third.\"\n\nAs [[Phil Fontaine]] National Chief, Assembly of First Nations, points out, racism in Canada today is for the most part, a covert operation. Its central and most distinguishing characteristic is the vigour with which it is consistently denied. There are many who argue that Canada's endeavours in the field of human rights and its stance against racism have only resulted in a \"more politically correct population who have learnt to better conceal their prejudices\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://prezi.com/b9p1qzffl466/privilege/|title=Privilege|work=prezi.com|accessdate=12 July 2015}}</ref> In effect, the argument is that racism in Canada is not being eliminated, but rather is becoming more covert, more rational and perhaps more deeply imbedded in our institutions. \nThat racism is alive is evidenced by the recent referendum in British Columbia by which the provincial government is asking the white majority to decide on a mandate for negotiating treaties with the Indian minority.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/ILB/2002/33.html|title=Kajlich, Helena --- \"The British Columbia Treaty Referendum: An Appropriate Democratic Exercise?\" [2002] IndigLawB 33; (2002) 5(17) Indigenous Law Bulletin 11|publisher=|accessdate=12 July 2015}}</ref> The results of the referendum will be binding,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.turtleisland.org/news/news-bctreaty-referendum1.htm|title=British Columbia Treaty referendum|publisher=|accessdate=12 July 2015}}</ref> the government having legislatively committed itself to act on these principles if more than 50% of those voting reply in the same way.

This policy was enforced with the support of various Christian churches, who ran many of the schools. Over the course of the system's existence, approximately 30% of native children, roughly some 150,000, were placed in residential schools nationally, with the last school closing in 1996. There has long been controversy about the conditions experienced by students in the residential schools. While day schools for First Nations, Metis, and Inuit children always far outnumbered residential schools, a new consensus emerged in the early 21st century that the latter schools did significant harm to Aboriginal children who attended them by removing them from their families, depriving them of their ancestral languages, undergoing forced sterilization for some students, and by exposing many of them to physical leading to sexual abuse by staff members, and other students, and dis-enfranchising them forcibly.<ref>{{cite web|last=Harper |first=Stephen |authorlink=Stephen Harper |title=Statement of apology to former students of Indian Residential Schools |url=https://www.aadnc-aandc.gc.ca/eng/1100100015644/1100100015649 |website=Indian and Northern Affairs Canada |accessdate=May 7, 2017 |language=en |date=June 11, 2008 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170516080220/http://www.aadnc-aandc.gc.ca/eng/1100100015644/1100100015649 |archivedate=May 16, 2017 }}</ref>\n\nStarting in the 1990s, the government started a number of initiatives to address the effects of the Indian residential school. In March 1998, the government made a Statement of Reconciliation and established the Aboriginal Healing Foundation. In the fall of 2003, the Alternative Dispute Resolution process was launched, which was a process outside of court providing compensation and psychological support for former students of residential schools who were physically or sexually abused or were in situations of wrongful confinement. On June 11, 2008, Prime Minister Stephen Harper issued a formal apology on behalf of the sitting Cabinet and in front of an audience of Aboriginal delegates. A [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (Canada)|Truth and Reconciliation Commission]] ran from 2008 through to 2015 in order to document past wrongdoing in the hope of resolving conflict left over from the past.<ref>{{cite web|title=14.12 Elimination of Racial and Ethnic Stereotyping, Identification of Groups|url=http://www.btb.termiumplus.gc.ca/tcdnstyl-srch?lang=eng&srchtxt=indigenous&cur=2&nmbr=2&lettr=14&info0=14.12#zz14|website=Translation Bureau|publisher=Public Works and Government Services Canada|accessdate=April 30, 2017|language=en|year=2017}}</ref>\n\n==Algeria==\n{{main|Pacification of Algeria}}\n\nFrench political thinker [[Alexis de Tocqueville]] (1805\u201359) supported colonization in general, and in particular the colonization of Algeria. In several speeches on France's foreign affairs, and in two official reports presented to the National Assembly in March 1847 on behalf of an ad hoc commission, he also repeatedly commented on and analysed the issue in his voluminous correspondence. In short, De Tocqueville developed a theoretical basis for French expansion in North Africa.<ref>See De la colonie en Alg\u00e9rie, Complexe, Brussels, 1988, and Nous et les Autres, Seuil, Paris, 1989, \"Tocqueville\", pp 219-234.</ref> He even studied the Koran, sharply concluding that the religion of Muhammad was \"the main cause of the decadence ... of the Muslim world\". His opinions are also instructive about the early years of the French conquest and how the colonial state was first set up and organized. De Tocqueville emerged as an early advocate of \"total domination\" in Algeria and subsequent \"devastation of the country\".<ref>Alexis de Tocqueville, Travail sur l'Alg\u00e9rie, op cit, pp 699 and 706.</ref>  On 31 January 1830 when Charles X captured Algiers the French state thus began what became the institutional racism directed at the Kabyle, or Berbers, of Arab descent in north Africa. The [[Dey of Algiers]] had insulted the monarchy by slapping the French ambassador with a fly whisk and the French used this pretext to invade, and also put an end to [[piracy]] in the vicinity. The unofficial objective was to restore the prestige of the French crown and gain a foothold in North Africa, thereby preventing the British gaining advantage over France in the Mediterranean. The [[July Monarchy]], which came to power in 1831, inherited this burden. The next 9 years saw the indigenous population subjected to the [[Abdelkader El Djezairi|might]] of the French army. By 1840 more conservative elements gained control of the government and they dispatched General Thomas Bugeaud, the newly appointed governor of the colony, to [[French Algeria|Algeria]], marking the real start of the country's conquest. The methods employed were atrocious. The army deported villagers en masse; massacred the men and raped women; took the children hostage, stole livestock and harvests and destroyed orchards. De Tocqueville wrote, \"I believe the laws of war entitle us to ravage the country and that we must do this, either by destroying crops at harvest time, or all the time by making rapid incursions, known as raids, the aim of which is to carry off men and flocks.\"<ref>Alexis de Tocqueville, Travail sur l'Alg\u00e9rie in Oeuvres compl\u00e8tes, Paris, Gallimard, Biblioth\u00e8que de la Pl\u00e9iade, 1991, pp 704 and 705.</ref> He added: \"In France I have often heard people I respect, but do not approve, deplore [the army] burning harvests, emptying granaries and seizing unarmed men, women and children. As I see it, these are unfortunate necessities that any people wishing to make war on the Arabs must accept.\"<ref>In a work that seeks to defend the army's excesses, Pierre Montagnon wrote of the victims: \"500,000? A million? The truth must lie somewhere between these figures. Anything less would be to play down a terrible reality,\" La conqu\u00eate de l'Alg\u00e9rie, Paris, Pygmalion, 1986, p 414. If we compare these figures with historian Denise Bouche's estimate of the total population in 1830 at \"about three million people\", the scale of the massacres becomes clearer; see her Histoire de la colonisation fran\u00e7aise, volume 2, Paris, Fayard, 1998, p 23.</ref> He also advocated that \"all political freedoms must be suspended in Algeria\".<ref>Olivier LeCour Grandmaison (2001). \"Tocqueville et la conqu\u00eate de l'Alg\u00e9rie\" (in French). La Mazarine.</ref> [[Marshal Bugeaud]], who was the first governor-general as he was also heading the civil gov't, was rewarded by the King for the conquest, having instituted the [[French conquest of Algeria|systemic]] use of torture and following a \"[[scorched earth]]\" policy against the Arab population.\n\n===Land grab===\n\nOnce the conquest of Algiers was accomplished soldier-politician [[Bertrand Clauzel]] and others formed a company to acquire agricultural land and, despite official discouragement, to subsidize its settlement by European farmers, which triggered a [[land rush]]. He became governor general in 1835 and used his office to make private investments in land, encouraging bureaucrats and army officers in his administration to do the same. This development created a vested interest among government officials in greater French involvement in Algeria. Merchants with influence in the government also saw profit in land speculation which resulted in expanding the French occupation. Large agricultural tracts were carved out, factories and businesses began exploiting cheap local labor and also to benefit from laws and edicts that gave control to the French. The policy of limited occupation was formally abandoned in 1840 for one of complete control. By 1843, De Tocqueville intended to protect and extend expropriation by the [[rule of law]]. He therefore advocated setting up special courts, based on what he called \"summary\" procedure, to carry out massive expropriation for the benefit of French and other European settlers who would thus be able to purchase land at an attractive price and live in villages that the colonial government had equipped with fortifications, churches, schools and even fountains. His belief, which framed his writings and influenced state actions, was that the local people, who had been driven out by the army and robbed of their land by the judges, would gradually die out.\n\nThe French colonial state, as he conceived it and as it took shape in Algeria, was a two-tiered organization, quite unlike the regime in mainland France. It introduced two different political and legal systems which, in the last analysis, were based on racial, cultural and religious distinctions. According to De Tocqueville, the system that should apply to the colonizers would enable them alone to hold property and travel freely, but would deprive them of any form of political freedom, which should be suspended in Algeria. \"There should therefore be two quite distinct legislations in Africa, for there are two very separate communities. There is absolutely nothing to prevent us treating Europeans as if they were on their own, as the rules established for them will only ever apply to them\".<ref>Alexis de Tocqueville, Travail sur l'Alg\u00e9rie, op cit, p 752.</ref>\n\nFollowing the defeats of the Muslim army in the 1840s colonization continued apace. By 1848, Algeria was populated by 109,400 Europeans, only 42,274 of which were French.<ref>Sessions, Jennifer (2011). By Sword and Plow: France and the Conquest of Algeria.

The [[Colonialism|colonials]] imposed more and higher taxes on [[Muslims]] than on [[Europeans]].<ref>Alistair Horne, page 63 \"A Savage War of Peace\", {{ISBN|0-670-61964-7}}</ref> The Muslims, in addition to paying traditional taxes dating from before the French conquest, also paid new taxes, from which the colons were normally exempted. In 1909, for instance, [[Muslims]], who made up almost 90% of the population but produced 20% of Algeria's income, paid 70% of direct taxes and 45% of the total taxes collected. And colons controlled how these revenues would be spent. As a result, colon towns had handsome municipal buildings, paved streets lined with trees, fountains and statues, while Algerian villages and rural areas benefited little if at all from tax revenues.\n\n===In education===\n\nThe colonial regime proved severely detrimental to overall education for Algerian Muslims, who had previously relied on religious schools to learn reading, writing, and engage in religious studies. Not only did the state appropriate the habus lands (the religious foundations that constituted the main source of income for religious institutions, including schools) in 1843, but colon officials refused to allocate enough money to maintain schools and mosques properly and to provide for enough teachers and religious leaders for the growing population. In 1892, more than five times as much was spent for the education of Europeans as for Muslims, who had five times as many children of school age. Because few Muslim teachers were trained, Muslim schools were largely staffed by French teachers. Even a state-operated [[madrasa]]h often had French faculty members. Attempts to institute [[bilingual]], [[bicultural]] schools, intended to bring Muslim and European children together in the classroom, were a conspicuous failure, rejected by both communities and phased out after 1870. According to one estimate, fewer than 5% of Algerian children attended any kind of school in 1870. As late as 1954 only one Muslim boy in five and one girl in sixteen was receiving formal schooling.<ref>Alistair Horne, pages 60-61 \"A Savage War of Peace\", {{ISBN|0-670-61964-7}}</ref> Efforts were begun by 1890 to educate a small number of Muslims along with European students in the French school system as part of France's \"civilizing mission\" in Algeria. The curriculum was entirely French and allowed no place for Arabic studies, which were deliberately downgraded even in Muslim schools. Within a generation, a class of well-educated, gallicized Muslims \u2013 the [[Nationalism and resistance in Algeria|\u00e9volu\u00e9s]] (literally, the evolved ones) \u2013 had been created.\n\n===Enfranchisement===\nFollowing its conquest of [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] controlled Algeria in 1830, for well over a century France maintained [[colonial rule]] in the territory which has been described as \"quasi-apartheid\".<ref>\"Algeria was in fact a colony but constitutionally was a part of France and not thought of in the 1950s as a colony.

Institutional racism had its early roots here due to interactions between these islanders who had Melanesian origins and depended on the sea for sustenance whose land rights were abrogated; and later the Australian Aboriginal peoples whose children were removed from their families by Australian Federal and State government agencies and church missions, under acts of their respective parliaments.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stolengenerations123.wikispaces.com/Emergence+of+the+child+removal+policy|title=stolengenerations123 - Emergence of the child removal policy|accessdate=12 July 2015}}</ref> The removals occurred in the period between approximately 1909 and 1969.

In the remote communities, the report cited 71% of the population in these remote discrete indigenous communities lacked access to public transportation and 78% of the communities were more than 50 miles from the nearest hospital. Although English is the official language of Australia, many indigenous Australians do not speak it as a primary language and the lack of printed materials that are translated into the Aboriginal languages and the non-availability of translators form a barrier to adequate health care for the Aborigines.

[[William Macpherson (judge)|Sir William Macpherson]] used the term as a description of \"the collective failure of an organisation to provide an appropriate and professional service to people because of their colour, culture or ethnic origin\", which \"can be seen or detected in processes, attitudes, and behaviour, which amount to discrimination through unwitting prejudice, ignorance, thoughtlessness, and racist stereotyping, which disadvantages minority ethnic people\".<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/lawrence/Story/0,,941167,00.html \"Metropolitan police still institutionally racist\"], [[The Guardian]], 22 April 2003</ref> Sir William's definition is almost identical to Stokely Carmichael's original definition some forty years earlier. Stokely Carmichael and Charles Hamilton 1967 were black power activists and first used the term 'institutional racism' to describe the consequences of a societal structure that was stratified into a racial hierarchy that resulted in layers of discrimination and inequality for minority ethnic people in housing, income, employment, education and health (Garner 2004:22).<ref name=\"Blagg2008\">{{cite book|last=Blagg|first=Harry|title=Crime, Aboriginality and the Decolonisation of Justice|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ojyQTjn8FFgC&pg=PA9|date=1 January 2008|publisher=Hawkins Press|isbn=978-1-876067-19-9|page=9}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Stephen Lawrence#The Stephen Lawrence Inquiry Report|Stephen Lawrence Inquiry Report]], and the public's response to it, were among the major factors that forced the [[Metropolitan Police]] to address its treatment of ethnic minorities. More recently, the former [[Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis|Metropolitan Police Commissioner]], [[Ian Blair|Sir Ian Blair]] said that the British news media are institutionally racist,<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/4651368.stm \"Met chief accuses media of racism\"], [[BBC]], 26 January 2006</ref> a comment that offended journalists, provoking angry responses from the media, despite the [[National Black Police Association (UK)|National Black Police Association]] welcoming Blair's assessment.<ref>[http://media.guardian.co.uk/site/story/0,14173,1696070,00.html?gusrc=rss \"Met chief labels media institutionally racist\"], [[The Guardian]], 27 January 2006</ref>\n\nThe report also found that the Metropolitan Police was institutionally racist. A total of 70 recommendations for reform were made. These proposals included abolishing the double jeopardy rule and criminalising racist statements made in private. Macpherson also called for reform in the British Civil Service, local governments, the National Health Service, schools, and the judicial system, to address issues of institutional racism.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Holdaway | first1 = Simon | last2 = O'Neill | first2 = Megan | year = 2006 | title = Institutional Racism after Macpherson: An Analysis of Police Views | url = | journal = Policing and Society | volume = 16 | issue = 4| pages = 349\u2013369 | doi = 10.1080/10439460600967885 }}</ref>\n\nIn June 2015, the [[Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis|Metropolitan Police Commissioner]], [[Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe]], said there was some justification in claims that the Metropolitan Police Service is institutionally racist.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-33025853|title=Met acknowledges 'some justification' to claims the force is 'racist'|publisher=BBC News |date=5 June 2015|accessdate=22 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Criminal conviction===\nWhile problems with the treatment of minorities in criminal investigations were found institutional, another aspect of criminal conviction crossed the line, affecting both white and black convicts. For 7 years, the courts in the U.K. handed down sentences for minor crimes that resulted in virtual life in prison. By 2012, the use of [[Imprisonment for public protection|IPP]] sentence guidelines were curtailed, however, three years after the sentences were abolished, more than three fourths of the 4,612 IPP prisoners still jailed in the system have passed the minimum sentence term set by the court. 200 more have been in prison for nearly a decade \u2013 despite being given a minimum sentence of less than two years.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.vice.com/article/exclusive-vice-news-investigates-the-uks-4500-prisoners-doing-life-for-minor-crimes|title=Exclusive: VICE News Investigates the UK's 4,500 Prisoners Doing Life for Minor Crimes|date=|work=VICE News|accessdate=26 October 2015}}</ref> These guidelines were introduced to keep criminals behind bars until they were no longer deemed a risk to the public, but where their crimes did not warrant a fixed life sentence. Although they were designed for the most dangerous offenders, IPP sentences were given out for relatively minor crimes including affray (fighting in public), minor criminal damage worth less than 20 pounds, and shoplifting. They were ended in 2012 after the [[European Court of Human Rights]] ruled that all prisoners had the right to know how long they were being held for. UK courts stopped handing out the sentences, but the ban did nothing to impact those already serving an IPP.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://you.38degrees.org.uk/petitions/free-the-remaining-ipp-prisoners?source=twitter-share-button|title=Free the remaining Ipp prisoners.|date=|work=Campaigns by You|accessdate=26 October 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn a kafkaesque turn, many cannot be released as they cannot complete the courses required as a condition of release due to them not being offered, and paperwork to conclude parole hearings is not prepared before the hearings, only after the hearing is concluded due to lack of paperwork.

Those marked as black were further discriminated against differentially, with Africans facing more extreme forms of exclusion and exploitation than those marked as coloured or Indian. One such example of institutional racism in South Africa is [[Natives Land Act, 1913]], which reserved 90% of land for white use and the Native Urban Areas Act of 1923 controlled access to urban areas, which suited commercial farmers who were keen to hold labour on their land. Africans, who formed the majority of the population, were relegated to barren\nrural reserves, which later became homelands.<ref>Bozalek, Vivienne. \"[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Vivienne_Bozalek/publication/258185153_The_Effect_of_Institutional_Racism_on_Student_Family_Circumstances_A_Human_Capabilities_Perspective/links/545bacb90cf249070a7a7a7e.pdf The Effect of Institutional Racism on Student Family Circumstances: A Human Capabilities Perspective].\" South African Journal of Psychology 40.4 (2010): 487-494.

When a black family moves into a home in a white neighborhood and is stoned, burned or routed out, they are victims of an overt act of individual racism which most people will condemn. But it is institutional racism that keeps black people locked in dilapidated slum tenements, subject to the daily prey of exploitative slumlords, merchants, loan sharks and discriminatory real estate agents. The society either pretends it does not know of this latter situation, or is in fact incapable of doing anything meaningful about it.\"<ref>http://nationalhumanitiescenter.org/pds/maai3/segregation/text8/carmichael.pdf</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Carmichael|first1=Stokely|authorlink1=Stokely Carmichael|last2=Hamilton|first2=Charles V.|authorlink2=Charles V.

When the differential access becomes integral to institutions, it becomes common practice, making it difficult to rectify. Eventually, this racism dominates public bodies, private corporations, public and private universities, and is reinforced by the actions of conformists and newcomers. Another difficulty in reducing institutionalized racism is that there is no sole, true identifiable perpetrator. When racism is built into the institution, it emerges as the collective action of the population.\n\nProfessor James M. Jones postulates three major types of racism: personally mediated, [[Internalized racism|internalized]], and institutionalized.<ref>Jones, J. M. (1997). ''Prejudice and Racism'' (2nd ed.). New York: McGraw-Hill.</ref> Personally mediated racism includes the specific social attitudes inherent to racially prejudiced action ([[bigotry|bigoted]] differential assumptions about abilities, motives, and the intentions of others according to), [[discrimination]] (the differential actions and behaviours towards others according to their race), [[stereotyping]], commission, and omission (disrespect, suspicion, devaluation, and dehumanization). [[Internalized racism]] is the acceptance, by members of the racially [[stigmatized]] people, of negative perceptions about their own abilities and intrinsic worth, characterized by low [[self-esteem]], and low esteem of others like them. This racism can be manifested through embracing \"whiteness\" (e.g. [[Social stratification|stratification]] by skin colour in non-white communities), self-devaluation (e.g., racial slurs, nicknames, rejection of ancestral culture, etc.), and resignation, helplessness, and hopelessness (e.g., [[dropping out]] of school, [[abstention|failing to vote]], engaging in health-risk practices, etc.).\n\nPersistent negative [[stereotype]]s fuel institutional racism, and influence [[interpersonal relations]]. Racial stereotyping contributes to patterns of [[racial segregation#United States|racial residential segregation]] and [[redlining]], and shape views about crime, crime policy, and welfare policy, especially if the contextual information is stereotype-consistent.<ref>[http://www2.asanet.org/centennial/race_ethnicity_health.pdf Race, Ethnicity, and the Health of Americans.

One example of the difference is public school budgets in the U.S. (including local levies and bonds) and the quality of teachers, which are often correlated with property values: rich neighborhoods are more likely to be more 'white' and to have better teachers and more money for education, even in public schools. [[restrictive covenants|Restrictive housing contracts]] and bank lending policies have also been listed as forms of institutional racism. Other examples sometimes described as institutional racism are [[racial profiling]] by security guards and police, use of stereotyped racial caricatures, the under- and misrepresentation of certain racial groups in the [[mass media]], and race-based barriers to gainful employment and professional advancement. Additionally, differential access to goods, services, and opportunities of society can be included within the term ''institutional racism'', such as unpaved streets and roads, inherited socio-economic disadvantage, and \"standardized\" tests (each ethnic group prepared for it differently; many are poorly prepared).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.aaup.org/article/why-standardized-tests-have-standardized-postracial-ideology#.W7JDamhKjIU|title=Why Standardized Tests Have Standardized Postracial Ideology {{!}} AAUP|website=aaup.org|language=en|access-date=2018-10-01}}</ref>\n\nSome [[sociology|sociological]]<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.strategicpractice.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/GPP_4FacesOfPower.pdf | title=The Four Faces of Power | last=Healey | first=Richard | last2=Hinson| first2=Sandra}}</ref> investigators distinguish between institutional racism and \"structural racism\" (sometimes called structured [[racialization]]).<ref>[http://kirwaninstitute.osu.edu/docs/NewSR-brochure-FINAL.pdf Kirwan Institute brochure]</ref> The former focuses upon the norms and practices within an institution, the latter upon the ''interactions'' among institutions, interactions that produce [[racialized]] outcomes against non-white people.<ref name=\"esdc.gc.ca\">{{cite web|url=http://www.esdc.gc.ca/eng/communities/reports/poverty_profile/snapshot.shtml|title=Snapshot of racialized Poverty in Canada|accessdate=12 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161211143715/http://www.esdc.gc.ca/eng/communities/reports/poverty_profile/snapshot.shtml|archive-date=11 December 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> An important feature of structural racism is that it cannot be reduced to individual [[prejudice]] or to the single function of an institution.\n\n== United States ==\n\n=== In housing and loan ===\n[[File:NOLA16Sep13 Iberville Fence.JPG|thumb|Iberville Housing Projects in New Orleans, Louisiana]]\nInstitutional racism in the housing sector can be seen as early as the 1930s with the [[Home Owners' Loan Corporation]]. Banks would determine a neighborhood's risk for loan default and [[Redlining|redline]] neighborhoods that were at high risk of default. These neighborhoods tended to be African American neighborhoods, whereas white-middle-class Americans were able to receive housing loans.

Lenders targeted high-interest subprime loans to low-income and minority neighborhoods who might be eligible for fair-interest prime loans.

A settlement with the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Dept]] and the [[Consumer Financial Protection Bureau]] was the largest in the history of both agencies, topping $33 million in restitution for the practice from New Jersey's largest savings bank. The bank had been accused of steering clear of minority neighborhoods and favoring white suburban borrowers in granting loans and mortgages, finding that of the approximately 1900 mortgages made in 2014 only 25 went to black applicants. The banks' executives denied bias, and the settlement came with adjustments to the banks business practices. This followed other successful efforts by the federal, state and city officials in 2014 to expand lending programs directed at minorities, and in some cases to force banks to pay penalties for patterns of redlining in Providence, R.I.; St. Louis, Mo.; Milwaukee, WI.; Buffalo and Rochester, N.Y.  The Justice Dept also has more active redlining investigations underway,<ref>Rachel Witkowski (8 May 2015).

''National Mortgage News''.</ref> and officials have stated to reporters that \"redlining is not a thing of the past\". It has evolved into a more politically correct version, where bankers do not talk about denying loans to blacks openly. The justice department officials noted that some banks have quietly institutionalized bias in their operations. They have moved their operations out of minority communities entirely, while others have moved in to fill the void and compete for clients. Such management decisions are not the stated intent, it is left unspoken so that even the bank's other customers are unaware that it is occurring. The effect on minority communities can be profound as home ownership, a prime source of neighborhood stability and economic mobility can affect its vulnerability to blight and disrepair. In the 1960s and 1970s laws were passed banning the practice; its return is far less overt, and while the vast majority of banks operate legally, the practice appears to be more widespread as the investigation revealed a vast disparity in loans approved for blacks vs whites in similar situations.<ref>Long banned, mortgage bias returns as issue, ''New York Times'' article, Saturday, October 1, 2015, pg 1</ref>\n\nStudies in major cities such as Los Angeles and Baltimore show that communities of color have lower levels of access to parks and green space.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Wolsh|first1=Jennifer|last2=Wilson|first2=John P.|last3=Fehrenbach|first3=Jed|title=Parks and Park Funding in Los Angeles: An Equity Mapping Analysis|url=http://lusk.usc.edu/sites/default/files/working_papers/Wolch.parks_.pdf|website=University of Southern California}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Boone|first1=Christopher|last2=Buckley|first2=Geoffrey|last3=Grove|first3=J.

The Justice Dept, following a 20-month investigation based on 33,000 cases over three years, reported that black youths were treated more harshly than whites and that all low-income youths, regardless of race, were deprived of their basic constitutional rights. Youths who encountered law enforcement got little or no chance to challenge detention or get any help from lawyers. With only one public defender assigned to juveniles in a county of one million, that legal aide handled 394 cases in 2014. The investigation was unrelated to the notorious case which roiled St. Louis, beginning before the police shooting of the unarmed black youth.<ref>{{cite web|last=Grossman |first=Andrew |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/ferguson-police-accused-of-racial-bias-by-federal-investigation-1425411657 |title=Ferguson Police, Courts Accused of Racial Bias by Justice Department Probe |publisher=WSJ |date=2015-03-03 |accessdate=2015-10-26}}</ref> The failure to grant access to counsel brought to light the practice of an informal process which could let offenders off with a warning or having them enter into diversion programs in lieu of  being charged in court. But to be accepted into the informal process, offenders had to admit to guilt, which runs afoul of the right not to incriminate oneself in criminal proceedings. The investigation following Michael Brown's shooting found an enormous disparity in the way juvenile cases were handled, with blacks being 47% more likely than whites to be put through the formal criminal proceedings. It also found them more likely to be held in detention, and also subsequently sentenced to incarceration once the case was finished. They were also more likely to be detained for violating parole from a previous case.<ref>\"The US finds racial Bias in a court in Missouri\", ''New York Times'' August 1, 2015, Nat'l news</ref>\n\nThe county did not cooperate fully with the Justice Dept and the St. Louis Family Court declined to comment, as did the state court system, of which it is a part.

In most state courts, the public defender's office decides who is poor enough to merit representation; in St. Louis Family Court the judge or court commissioner, sometimes based on different standards, decides who gets access to counsel. Most troubling to the justice official was the continuing use of court officials to recite complicated statutory language about the alleged crimes, then leading the defendants through \"formulaic 'do you understand' and yes/no questions.\" Judges made no effort to find out if the pleas were coerced, whether the child had any criminal intent or especially, did they fully understand the consequences of pleading guilty to the charges. Their competency to take part in their own defense was never established and the legal aide in the cases examined never challenged a probable cause finding, hired an expert witness or challenged hearsay evidence or leading questions and most cases ended with the child pleading guilty. The Civil Rights Division (of  the Justice Dept) began four investigations beginning in 2013 delving into juvenile justice systems in Miss., Tenn., Texas, and Missouri and while settlements were reached it has had to file suit to overcome the disparities in criminal convictions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/doj-report-critical-st-louis-county-family-court-32805053 |title=U.S. News &#124; National News - ABC News |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date=2015-10-16 |accessdate=2015-10-26}}</ref>\n\nCoupled with [[zero-tolerance]] discipline in schools, a \"one size fits all solution\" decried by the [[American Bar Association]], black and Latino youth are more likely to encounter negative contact with law enforcement and accrue violations, which leads to fines and failure to pay, which in turn leads to warrants and/or probation violations.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/04/opinion/schoolkids-in-handcuffs.html|title=Schoolkids in Handcuffs|last=The Editorial Board|date=4 November 2015|accessdate=15 June 2017|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref> This cycle has been shown to put children, particularly low-income minorities, in the [[school-to-prison pipeline]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.aclu.org/fact-sheet/what-school-prison-pipeline |title=What is the School-to-Prison Pipeline? &#124; American Civil Liberties Union |publisher=Aclu.org |date=2008-03-11 |accessdate=2015-10-26}}</ref>\n\n====Judicial misconduct====\n{{See also|Judicial misconduct}}\n\nIn 2010, two Washington state supreme court justices, Richard Sanders and James Johnson, were baffled at a court meeting to determine the fate of $25,000 in funding for various boards and commissions. They stated that there was too much African American representation in the prison population because African Americans are known to commit a number crimes and not because of their race. A black lawyer says she was shocked to hear two justices, [[Richard B. Sanders]] and Johnson, refer to a former legal aid lawyer's assertions in a report using the phrase ''poverty pimp''. Shirley Bondon, a state Administrative Office of the Courts (AOC) manager who oversaw court programs critical of the legal system, told the justices that she believed there was racial \"bias in the criminal-justice system, from the bottom up.\" The response from Justice Saunders was critical of blacks, stating that he didn't believe the barriers existed, except for poverty because it might restrict the ability to afford an attorney. [[James M. Johnson (judge)|James M. Johnson]], who was noted as the most conservative judge on the court, agreed, noting that African Americans commit them [crimes] against their own communities, to which Bondon objected, requesting a closed-door meeting with the court.

The men were subsequently released based on a pre-trial motion from the defense, claiming that the federal government had no basis for charging them, as no federal law was broken. Arizona officials never initiated criminal proceedings in state court against those responsible for the deportation of workers and their lost wages and other losses. The Justice Department appealed, but in [[United States v. Wheeler (1920)|United States v. Wheeler]], 254 U.S. 281 (1920), Chief Justice [[Edward Douglass White]] wrote for an 8-to-1 majority that the U.S. Constitution did not empower the federal government to enforce the rights of the deportees. Rather it \"necessarily assumed the continued possession by the states of the reserved power to deal with free residence, ingress, and egress.\" Only in a case of \"state discriminatory action\" would the federal government have a role to play. By this calculated reasoning, the officials situated at the Supreme Court erred in not taking the side that in today's legal lexicon had every right to seek justice and redress, not only for the stolen wages, union busting, false imprisonment and other crimes, but for the inherent right not to be forcibly removed from your home by men with guns and shipped in cattle cars across state lines as many homeowners were. That 8 of the 9 supreme court justices concurred and based on anti-radical speech sentiment at the time (post WWI anti-union and IWW)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://depts.washington.edu/antiwar/WW1_reds.shtml |title=World War I antiwar movement |publisher=Depts.washington.edu |date= |access-date=2015-10-26}}</ref> leads to the conclusion that the government gave the company cover to remove the workers, many of whom were Mexicans advocating for better pay and working condition, to a place in the next state closer to the border with the admonition ''never to return''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.desertexposure.com/200707/200707_wobblies.php|title=Desert Exposure Wobblies July 2007|author=|date=|website=DesertExposure.com|access-date=15 June 2017}}</ref> That few deportees returned and those that contested the deportations lost their cases to have their homes returned to [[Necessity (criminal law)|necessity]], and that in 1966 Finally, in [[United States v.

Mitchell Palmer]] and others advocated for a peacetime equivalent of the [[Sedition Act of 1918|Sedition Act]], using the Bisbee events as a justification. They stated that the only reason the company representatives and local law enforcement had taken the law into their own hands was that the government lacked the power to suppress radical sentiment directly. If the government was armed with appropriate legislation and the threat of long prison terms, private citizens would not feel the need to act. Writing in 1920, Harvard Professor [[Zechariah Chafee]] mocked that view: \"Doubtless some governmental action was required to protect pacifists and extreme radicals from mob violence, but incarceration for a period of twenty years seems a very queer kind of protection.<ref>Zechariah Chafee, Jr., Freedom of Speech (NY: Harcourt, Brace, and Howe, 1920), 45-46.</ref> That this was considered [[vigilante]] actions by private citizens duly deputized by the local sheriff gives no weight to the racist component directed towards those of Mexican descent in Arizona, New Mexico, and  Texas, who were being systematically forced from their homes in the US beginning in 1910.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/pqmyk|title=Mexican Americans and Repatriation|date=|work=tshaonline.org|accessdate=26 October 2015}}</ref>\n\n====Lynching of people of Mexican Descent====\n\n{{Main|Porvenir massacre (1918)}}\nVigilante actions against Mexicans in the southwest had been documented from the 1850s to 1930s of men, women and children, many of them American citizens; who were burned, shot, hung, whipped or mutilated due to racist terror. Thousands were killed by white settlers and gold prospectors to drive them off their land or steal their claims using false charges to gin up mob actions. Many of the killings took place in front of hundreds who encouraged mobs to remove the men from jails to lynch them. In Texas the [[Texas Ranger Division|Rangers]] were implicated by archeological digs at the sites of one of the massacres that took place near the U.S. Army razed village of Porvenir near the Mexican border in Marfa, Texas.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rimrockpress.com/blog/index.php?entry=entry151216-162435|title=PORVENIR MASSACRE ARCHAEOLOGY MOST REVEALING|last=Justice|first=Glenn|date=2017-04-21|website=Glenn's Texas History Blog|access-date=}}</ref> Many of the state sanctioned killings which occurred in Texas have been removed from public view and recent efforts to increase awareness have been stymied by state commissions on historic places.

She was later over-ruled by the head of the State Historical Commission, who brokered a deal to also erect markers at Anglo ranches that were victims of suspected Mexican [[Villistas]], which may also have been a response to the extrajudicial killings by the Rangers and Ranchers.<ref>\"1919 Ranger Investigation\".

Strikers became targets of [[agent provocateurs]] who infiltrated meetings of \"communist labor\" and anti-war activists. After the Bisbee deportations became exposed in the press, Americans were divided about the treatment of illegal aliens, who were purported communists. Former President Theodore Roosevelt opined in the press that the Bisbee miners \"had it coming, as they were hell-bent on havoc!\" The Dept of Justice went from advocating for persons deprived of rights and liberty by state actors to detaining them under dubious warrants and suspicion of radicalism. The [[First Red Scare|Red Scare]] that fueled institutional racism in the 1920s against Russian Jews and other Eastern European immigrants was a backlash to the 1917 Bolshevik revolution in Russia and a [[1919 United States anarchist bombings|bombing campaign]]  early in 1919 by Italian anarchists advocating the overthrow of the government. The result was the infamous [[Palmer raids]], ostensibly a deportation measure to remove dangerous aliens. In 1919 Attorney General [[A. Mitchell Palmer]] began a series of raids cooked up to remove radicals and anarchists from the US. Warrants were requested from compliant officials in the [[United States Department of Labor|Labor Dept]], and a number of foreign nationals caught up in the sweeping raids were eventually deported. As only the department of labor had the legal right to deport aliens, they did object to the methods; nevertheless, under [[color of law]], the raids began on November 7, 1919. It was led by a 24-year-old [[J. Edgar Hoover]]  heading a new division of the Justice Department's [[Bureau of Investigation]], called the General Intelligence Division. Armed with responsibility for investigating the programs of radical groups and identifying their members, the raids began with agents of the Bureau of Investigation, together with local police, executing a series of well-publicized and violent raids against the [[Union of Russian Workers]] in 12 cities.\n\nNewspaper accounts reported some were \"badly beaten\" during the arrests. Many later swore they were threatened and beaten during questioning. Government agents cast a wide net, bringing in some American citizens, passers-by who admitted being Russian, some not members of the Russian Workers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/toamericanpeople00natiuoft/toamericanpeople00natiuoft_djvu.txt|title=Full text of \"To the American people; report upon the illegal practices of the United States Department of justice\"|date=|work=archive.org|accessdate=26 October 2015}}</ref> Others were teachers conducting night school classes in space shared with the targeted radical groups. Arrests far exceeded the number of warrants. Of 650 arrested in New York City, the government managed to deport just 43. Hoover organized the next raids. He successfully persuaded the Department of Labor to ease its insistence on promptly alerting those arrested of their right to an attorney. Instead, Labor issued instructions that its representatives could wait until after the case against the defendant was established, \"in order to protect government interests.\"<ref name=\"proprocedure.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.proprocedure.com/labor_history/content8.php|title=Labor History|date=|work=proprocedure.com|accessdate=26 October 2015}}</ref> Less openly, Hoover decided to interpret Labor's agreement to act against the Communist Party to include a different organization, the [[Communist Labor Party of America|Communist Labor Party]]. Finally, despite the fact that Secretary of Labor [[William B. Wilson]] insisted that more than membership in an organization was required for a warrant, Hoover worked with more compliant Labor officials and overwhelmed Labor staff to get the warrants he wanted. Justice Department officials, including Palmer and Hoover, later claimed ignorance of such details.\n\nThe Justice Department launched a series of raids on January 2, 1920, with follow-up operations over the next few days. Smaller raids extended over the next six weeks. At least 3,000 were arrested, and many others were held for various lengths of time. The entire enterprise replicated the November action on a larger scale, including arrests and seizures without search warrants, as well as detention in overcrowded and unsanitary holding facilities. Hoover later admitted \"clear cases of brutality\". Some cases in Boston included torture, where detainees were placed in a 'hot box' above a furnace and given one glass of water and a slice of bread a day and kept there for 50 hours. The raids covered more than 30 cities and towns in 23 states, but those west of the Mississippi and south of Ohio were \"publicity gestures\" designed to make the effort appear nationwide in scope. Because the raids targeted entire organizations, agents arrested everyone found in organization meeting halls, not only arresting non-radical organization members but also visitors who did not belong to a target organization, and sometimes American citizens not eligible for arrest and deportation. In a few weeks, after changes in personnel at the Department of Labor, Palmer faced a new and very independent-minded Acting Secretary of Labor in Assistant Secretary of Labor [[Louis Freeland Post]], who canceled more than 2,000 warrants as being illegal. Of the 10,000 arrested, 3,500 were held by authorities in detention; 556 resident aliens were eventually deported under the [[Immigration Act of 1918]].\nAt a Cabinet meeting in April 1920, Palmer called on Secretary of Labor Wilson to fire Post, but Secretary Wilson defended him. The President listened to his feuding department heads and offered no comment about Post, but he ended the meeting by telling Palmer that he should \"not let this country see red.\" Secretary of the Navy [[Josephus Daniels]], who made notes of the conversation, thought the Attorney General had merited the President's \"admonition,\" because Palmer \"was seeing red behind every bush and every demand for an increase in wages.\"<ref name=\"Shogan2013\">{{cite book|last=Shogan|first=Robert|title=The Battle of Blair Mountain: The Story of America's Largest Labor Uprising|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IVmypbQvHwAC&pg=PA62|date=20 August 2013|publisher=Basic Books|isbn=978-0-7867-3594-5|pages=62\u2013}}</ref>\n\n=====Other=====\nOn May 28, 1920, the [[American Civil Liberties Union|ACLU]] published its \"Report Upon the Illegal Practices of the United States Department of Justice\",<ref>{{cite web | url=http://debs.indstate.edu/n277t6_1920.pdf | title=Report Upon the Illegal Practices of the United States Department of Justice | publisher=ACLU | date=May 28, 1920}}</ref> which carefully documented the Justice Department's unlawful activities in arresting suspected radicals, illegal entrapment by [[agents provocateurs]], and unlawful incommunicado detention.

Many other minorities also suffered from institutional racism. One example is immigration policies against Chinese. The intensified job competition during the 1870s on the West Coast between Chinese workers and Whites invoked anti-Chinese movement. The first Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 was passed to prohibit Chinese immigrating to the United States, resulting in only 10 Chinese immigrants into the U.S. in 1887.

In 1954 while the [[Bracero program]] was in force, the [[Immigration and Naturalization Service|INS]] used force to repatriate 1 million Mexicans. It was a system of tactical control and cooperation within the U.S. Border Patrol and alongside the Mexican government and was called [[Operation Wetback]]. With the growing diplomatic and security issues surrounding illegal border crossings, the INS increased its raids and apprehensions beginning in the early 1950s leading up to Operation Wetback. Those apprehended were often deported without the opportunity to recover their property in the US or contact family and were stranded without food or employment when they entered Mexico. Deported Mexicans faced extreme conditions and were sometimes left in the desert; 88 deported workers died in 112-degree heat in July 1955. Most were sent by ship to [[Veracruz (city)|Veracruz]] or transported by land to southern Mexican cities. During the entirety of the Operation, border recruitment of illegal workers by American growers continued due largely to the inexpensiveness of illegal labor and the desire of growers to avoid the bureaucratic obstacles of the Bracero program; the continuation of illegal immigration despite the efforts of Operation Wetback was largely responsible for the failure of the program.<ref>Kevin Starr, [https://books.google.com/books?id=7GvgN0y7yI4C&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false Endangered Dreams: The Great Depression in California] (1997) p. 261. {{ISBN|0195118022}}</ref>\n\nIn 2006, the House of Representatives congresspersons [[Hilda Solis]] and [[Luis Gutierrez]] called for an apology from the U.S. Government for the Repatriation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/2006-04-04-1930s-deportees-cover_x.htm|title=U.S. urged to apologize for 1930s deportations - USATODAY.com|accessdate=12 July 2015}}</ref> This has not occurred to date.

Authorized at the federal level in 1871, it came about due to reforms of the [[spoils system]] in place since the 1830s, and abuses of the post-Civil War era, when Congress authorized the president to appoint a Civil Service Commission and prescribe regulations for admission to public service. A dis-satisfied office-seeker assassinated President Garfield in 1881 and Congress was motivated to pass the [[Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act]] in 1883 which firmly established civil service. During reconstruction, this enabled the federal government to provide jobs for newly freed blacks in the south (primarily the Postal Service) where no other employment opportunities existed for them. Since the inception of the merit system in 1881, the numbers of blacks in federal civil service positions rose from 0.057 to 5.6% by 1910.

Following this, cities consulted with their attorneys and as a result, [[Racial integration|Integration]] began. This was replaced in turn by institutional racism, the practice of upholding the letter of the law, but not the spirit, in an effort to prevent minority hires from gaining ground in titles where they were disproportionately underrepresented, such as Police and Fire depts, and in management positions.<ref>{{cite web |first1=Cynthia |last1=Brown |first2=Jack |last2=Maskell |title=Hatch Act Restrictions on Federal Employees' Political Activities in the Digital Age |url=http://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R44469.pdf |work=[[Congressional Research Service]] |page=4 |date=April 13, 2016 |accessdate= December 16, 2017}}</ref>\n\n====Post-integration period====\n\nAround the country in the 1950s, blacks found common cause in challenging [[employment discrimination]], and the colored newspapers took up the cause. Economically, jobs were becoming scarce for minorities during the post-war years as returning servicemen reclaimed the manufacturing and factory base. Civil Service looked to be a reasonable alternative to blacks returning from WWII service overseas and black officers leaving the newly desegregated armed services.  In Los Angeles in the 1950s, the [[NAACP]] fueled an integration campaign in the [[California Eagle]] and petitioned the fire commission to provide more jobs in the LAFD. When the Fire Chief Engineer John Alderson attempted to integrate the department, the resistance to integration created so-called 'Hate Houses' and resulted in the formation of [[The Stentorians]] as a protective force of guardians to protect minority firefighters. New York had previously experienced their own revelations when the [[Vulcan Society]] appeared before the city council and demanded the elimination of 'the black bed' in firehouses for the black firemen. At that hearing in 1944, the NYC council chambers filled with FDNY brass on one side and black firefighters protesting the lack of promotional opportunities and racial harassment on the other.\n\nWith that as the backdrop, integration began and segregation was replaced by institutional racism, which took the form much the same way it did when blacks first got hired before and during WWI. Blacks once appointed to a civil service position were subjected to isolation, ostracism, outright hostility and separate quarters. After 1956, the first black hires to the LAFD after integration unfairly failed to finish academy training. The Vulcan Society in New York mentored many blacks but progress was slow, with hiring not reflected in mirroring the population of the cities served until the passage of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] when the numbers of minority hiring increased. The [[U.S. Department of Labor]] in the 1970s began enforcing racial quotas during the Nixon administration that mandated black hiring, but it was the lawsuits of the 1970s which exploded the imposition of Consent Decrees across the country forcing the diversity of the hard to integrate titles. In 1971 the [[Vulcan Blazers]] of the Baltimore, Maryland fire dept filed a groundbreaking lawsuit that resulted in the appointment of blacks to positions of officers up to assistant chief when the court ruled there had been discrimination in promotions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2011-12-06/html/CREC-2011-12-06-pt1-PgE2184-3.htm|title=Congressional Record, Volume 157 Issue 186 (Tuesday, December 6, 2011)|accessdate=12 July 2015}}</ref> Other minority groups followed their lead and also took to the courts. In 2009 the City of Baltimore paid $4.6 Million to settle a case of discrimination filed by minority policemen alleging discrimination.

W. Bush]] attempted to eliminate [[affirmative action]] during his term of office. He ordered the use of quotas, preferences, set-asides on the basis of race, sex, religion or national origin be abolished in hiring. Congress responded with the [[Civil Rights Act of 1991]], which only covered the terms for settling cases where discrimination had previously been confirmed. It had been near impossible to prove a case of [[institutional discrimination]] in the courts,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/491/164|title=Patterson v. McLean Credit Union|accessdate=12 July 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/06/16/us/excerpts-from-opinions-on-scope-of-rights-act.html|title=Excerpts From Opinions on Scope of Rights Act|first=Special To The New York|last=Times|date=16 June 1989|accessdate=15 June 2017|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref> and many other cases were terminated upon imposition of a [[consent decree]]. While President [[George H. W. Bush]]'s attempt failed, it fueled the rise in 1996 of the [[California Proposition 209]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/02/13/california-affirmative-action-ban-proposition-209_n_1274448.html|title=California Affirmative Action Ban, Proposition 209, Challenged in Court|work=The Huffington Post|accessdate=12 July 2015}}</ref> a ballot initiative abolishing affirmative action in California universities, to counteract what Institutionalized Racism. [[Affirmative action]] is where members of a minority group get preferential treatment over the majority rather than being treated as equals. This closed down the avenues [[affirmative action]] initiatives had opened for blacks to have race counted as a factor when accounting for different rates of acceptance to Universities and consequently in employment discrimination lawsuits that sought redress from discriminatory hiring. This is where the arguments for redress for past wrongs under the 'catchup provisions' no longer worked in favor of claimants.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/dec/03/news/mn-50304|title=Judge Upholds Key Affirmative Action Laws|work=latimes|accessdate=12 July 2015}}</ref> Proposition 209 has withstood challenges but in 2013 the California Senate passed Amendment #5 \u2013 which if implemented would have reversed 209 had its main sponsor in the Senate not retracted it before final passage. By 2014 the UCLA Board of Regents came out publicly against 209 after reviewing the loss of minorities in university admissions after 209 was implemented.\n\nThese ballot initiatives spread around the country primarily in [[red states]]. In 2003 the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] had ruled on affirmative action programs at the [[University of Michigan]] in ''[[Gratz v. Bollinger]]'' and [[Grutter v. Bollinger]]; the rulings found the affirmative action program was unconstitutional for the way it was applied, but ambiguously said it could continue to use affirmative action. This strengthened the campaign against racial preferences and proponents pressed ahead with more ballot initiatives under the theory that affirmative action programs were no longer needed. The tide against further passage of such discriminatory ballot box institutional racism didn't abate until the 2008 election cycle when efforts by [[Ward Connerly]], the chairman of the [[American Civil Rights Institute]], a national non-profit organization founded to oppose racial and gender preferences,<ref name=\"acri\">{{cite web |title=About the American Civil Rights Institute |url=http://acri.org/about-acri/|work=American Civil Rights Institute |accessdate=2009-04-28 }}</ref> failed to get ballot measures passed in 3 states, was rejected by voters in another, and only in Nebraska got passage to add one last state banning affirmative action as a remedy for past discrimination. His critics condemned Connerly's reasoning, saying he failed to see the extent of past racism on African Americans and Hispanics; and that contemporary institutionalized racism is pervasive and powerful, and that affirmative action can overcome the residual effects of past institutional racism on people of color. Advocates of [[Affirmative Action]] programs denied that these were '[[racial quotas]]' as that was seen as divisive and under [[color of law]], but affirmative action goals fell to this onslaught and subsequent [[reverse discrimination]] lawsuits ended the practice. Connerly, for his part, stated \"I think that in some quarters, many parts of the country, a white male is really disadvantaged ... Because we have developed this notion of women and minorities being so disadvantaged and we have to help them, that we have, in many cases, twisted the thing so that it's no longer a case of equal opportunity. It's a case of putting a fist on the scale.\"<ref name=\"Attack\">{{cite news |title=Attacking Affirmative Action |date=August 29, 2008 |work=NOW on PBS |publisher=PBS |url=https://www.pbs.org/now/shows/434/index.html |accessdate=2009-04-28 }}</ref> His [[multi-racial]] background caused conservatives to back his cause as he was perceived to be both black and anti-affirmative action.\n\n=== In education ===\n[[Standardized testing]] has also been considered a form of institutional racism, because it is believed to be biased in favor of people from particular socio-cultural backgrounds. Some minorities have consistently tested worse than whites on virtually all standardized tests, even after controlling for socioeconomic status, while others have tested consistently better. The cause of the achievement gaps between black, Hispanic, white and Asian students has yet to be fully elucidated.\n\n==== In higher education ====\nIn the 1960s, students of color started attending colleges and universities in record numbers after the passage of the Civil Rights and Higher Education Acts.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.aft.org/news/preserving-civil-rights-higher-education-act|title=Preserving civil rights in the Higher Education Act|date=2018-04-30|work=American Federation of Teachers|access-date=2018-09-30|language=en}}</ref> However, the obstacles of integration in predominantly white institutions of higher education led to unforeseen obstacles for faculty and students of color working and studying in such environments. According to a review of educational research, tension and violence followed, one reason being the lack of preparedness of many colleges and universities to teach a diversity of students.<ref name=\"Engberg\">{{cite journal|year=2004|title=Improving Intergroup Relations in Higher Education: A Critical Examination of the Influence of Educational Interventions on Racial Bias|url=|journal=American Educational Research Association|volume=74|issue=4|pages=473\u2013524|doi=10.3102/00346543074004473|last1=Engberg|first1=M.

Board of Education]] was ruled in 1954, actual integration did not completely occur until many years later; the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] held multiple hearings on the desegregation of schools, continuously they maintained that [[Brown v.

The underlying issue of minority presence of college campuses occurs. In 2008, the [[National Center for Education Statistics]] reported that while enrollment of minorities and students of color had risen, white enrollment still held the majority on average, accounting for 63 percent of undergraduate college and university students.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nces.ed.gov/pubs2010/2010015/indicator6_24.asp|title=Status and Trends in the Education of Racial and Ethnic Minorities|website=nces.ed.gov|language=EN|access-date=2018-10-14}}</ref> While this varies based on the region, state, and elite status, in general the majority of colleges and universities in the United States are predominantly white. According to the [[U.S. Department of Education,]] there has also been a rise in hate crimes on college campuses; 1250 hate crimes in 2016, up 25 percent from 2015.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.chronicle.com/article/After-2016-Election-Campus/242577|title=After 2016 Election, Campus Hate Crimes Seemed to Jump.

According to the [[U.S. Department of Education,]] being prepared for college is integral to whether or not a student is successful.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www2.ed.gov/offices/OPE/AgenProj/report/theme1a.html|title=ED.gov|website=www2.ed.gov|access-date=2018-10-14}}</ref> While the government offers college preparation programs for minority and low-income students, programs such as [[GEAR UP]] and [[Federal TRIO Programs]] help prepare students for college to better ensure their success and retention,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www2.ed.gov/programs/gearup/index.html|title=Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Programs (GEAR UP)|date=2018-06-08|website=www2.ed.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-10-14}}</ref> the access to these programs is relatively limited. While programs such as [[Federal TRIO Programs]] have grown since conception, there is still work that needs to be done if more minority students are expected to attend and succeed in a post-secondary institution. Due to availability of [[Federal TRIO Programs]] being subjective based on where geographically a student may be, the benefits are not completely being felt be the targeted communities. However, the positive effects of [[Federal TRIO Programs]] have been pretty bolstering\u2014more minorities and low-income individuals are prepared when going to post-secondary institutions.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.rti.org/impact/analysis-support-federal-trio-programs|title=Analysis Support for the Federal TRIO Programs|date=2016-06-10|work=RTI|access-date=2018-10-14|language=en}}</ref>\n\nInstitutionalized racism in higher education has received little national attention, even though it is a relevant issue affecting many colleges and universities. Despite efforts to improve the situation on college and university campuses, such as implementing [[affirmative action]] plans, anti-black racism and violence continue to occur.<ref>https://www.researchgate.net/profile/William_Smith57/publication/247752199_Assume_the_Position_You_Fit_the_Description_Psychosocial_Experiences_and_Racial_Battle_Fatigue_Among_African_American_Male_College_Students/links/54ef02da0cf2e55866f3daf4/Assume-the-Position-You-Fit-the-Description-Psychosocial-Experiences-and-Racial-Battle-Fatigue-Among-African-American-Male-College-Students.pdf</ref> The effects of this violence extend beyond the incident itself. According to a U.S. study in Baltimore, racism has a correlation with health complications, such as high systolic blood pressure.<ref name=\":22\">{{Cite news|url=https://theconversation.com/racism-impacts-your-health-84112|title=Racism impacts your health|last=Timothy|first=Roberta K.|work=The Conversation|access-date=2018-10-14|language=en}}</ref>  Likewise, a study held from 1997 to 2003 found that racism led to higher rates of breast cancer.<ref name=\":22\" /> While this extends beyond education, it could illustrate why many minorities and students of color would feel uneasy putting themselves into an environment that could potentially garner more racism.<ref name=\":22\" /> While illustrations of institutional racism on college campuses can be found in newspapers and blogs, there are other places to learn more about these incidents. Aside from the media, one source that can be used to keep up to date on institutional racism in higher education is ''[[The Journal of Blacks in Higher Education]]'' (JBHE). This journal aims to provide as much information as possible about anti-black institutional racism. JBHE publishes resources, statistics, and current reports of race-related actions on college and university campuses.<ref name=\":04\" /> For example, JBHE reported on the [[2015 University of Oklahoma Sigma Alpha Epsilon racism incident]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.jbhe.com/2015/03/video-shows-university-of-oklahoma-students-singing-racist-song/|title=Video Shows University of Oklahoma Students Singing Racist Song|date=2015-03-09|work=The Journal of Blacks in Higher Education|access-date=2017-03-14|language=en-US}}</ref> Other media resources where reports on racial incidents on college campuses can be found is [[Inside Higher Ed]] and [[Southern Poverty Law Center|the Southern Poverty Law Center]]\n\nIn 2016, the [[United States Department of Education|U.S. Department of Education]] released a report on crime in schools.

Institutions of higher education were often traditionally known as Predominantly White Institutions (PWI's).<ref>Christopher Brown II, M., & Elon Dancy II, T., 2010</ref> These institutions are now challenged to improve their diversity efforts and create policies that address the root cause of negative racial climates on PWI campuses. It is estimated that by 2010, 40% of high school graduates would be non-white.<ref name=\"rankin\">{{cite journal | last1 = Rankin | first1 = S. R. | last2 = Reason | first2 = R.

Universities and colleges that have identified diversity as one of their priorities should plan how to strategically and in a sensitive manner create a campus climate in which all students, in particular students of color in a PWI, do not have to risk feeling unsafe, discriminated against, marginalized or tokenized to obtain a post-secondary degree.\n\nData has shown that students of color and White students have different perceptions of campus racial climates. In a survey of 433 undergraduate students at one institution found that, in comparison to White students, students of color felt differently about campus policies. White students were more often to describe their campus racial climate as positive, while students of African descent rated it as negative. Findings indicate that students of color experience harassment that is, \"offensive, hostile, or intimidating\" at higher rates than White students, which interferes with their learning. Further, \"students of color perceived the climate as more racist and less accepting than did White students, even though White students recognized racial harassment at similar rates as students of color\".<ref name=\"rankin\" /> In addition, many African American students have a hard time to fit in a white predominant colleges because of the fear of \"becoming white.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Tyson|first1=Will|title=Social Segregation by Race at Predominantly White Universities|journal=Southern Sociological Society|date=2001|id={{ProQuest|61748890}}}}</ref>\n\nWhite students also felt more positive about their classroom experience and the way professors presented various viewpoints in the curriculum, about institutional policies as well as recruitment and retention of student of color. Students of African descent and other students of color felt the campus environment was not friendly and that they had been targets of racism. In another study of 5,000 first year students at 93 institutions, White students were more likely to agree with the statement that  \"racial discrimination is no longer a problem\" than students of color.<ref name=\"rankin\" /> White students were also more likely to feel that the campus climate is improving in comparison to students of color. White students felt the campus climate was non-racist, friendly, and respectful while students of color felt that it was racist, hostile, and disrespectful.<ref name=\"rankin\" /> Research has shown that racial diversification in colleges and universities, without intentional education about systemic racism and the history of race in the United States, can lead to creating a racial campus climate that is oppressive towards students of color.  There needs to be, \"intentional education interventions related to the changing racial composition of college students [which] would likely influence how the climate of an environment changes\".<ref name=\"rankin\" />\n\nIf institutional racism is to be addressed in institutes of higher education, different types of interventions need to be created, in particular, interventions created specifically for the academy. Rankin and Reason's research concluded that for intervention to be effective, faculty would need to be used as socializing agents on campus, in particular, because intellectual and behavioral norms on most campuses are set by faculty and, these norms have a heavy impact on campus climate.<ref name=\"rankin\" /> An example of students trying to change racial campus climate is the Being Black at the University of Michigan [[#BBUM]] moment. The Black Student Union is organizing and collaborating with organizations to bring attention to the racial climate at the [[University of Michigan]] and how it is affecting all students.<ref>Vega, T.

One example of this is required coursework through the departments of African/African-American Studies, Xicano studies, Asian-American studies, Arab American studies, and Native American studies alongside the History department. Research has shown that curricular diversity is positively associated with intergroup attitudes, decreased racial prejudice and intergroup understanding, and attitudes toward campus diversity.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Lopez | year = 2004 | title = Chang, 2002, Springer, Palmer, Terenzini, Pascarella, & Nora, 1996, as cited in Denson, N., & Chang, M.

Newly acquired freedom founded a growth in African American participation in politics. This period of increased African American participation, from 1867 to 1877, is known as [[Reconstruction Era|Radical Reconstruction]] or [[Black Reconstruction]].  Despite the increase in African American participation in politics, Radical Reconstruction is not mentioned as an example of how black politics strive to be. There are very distinct viewpoints concerning this time period.  \nSome believed that corruption had run rampart in the South with the introduction of newly freed slaves into legislation and a great deal of attention was given to the negativity that surrounded the introduction of black faces into government. The Reconstruction of South Carolina particularly was under scrutiny as the legislatures were predominantly black. The happenings in the South Carolina legislature were described negatively and seen as pro- black and significantly focused on issues that only pertained to blacks. Attention was solely focused on the misgivings occurring within legislature such as, \"unethical appropriation of state funds by members of the legislature\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ladenburg|first1=Thomas|last2=McFeely|first2=William|title=The Black Man in the Land of Equality|date=1969|publisher=Hayden Book Company Inc.|location=United States of America}}</ref> and other unethical and illegal acts committed by both black and white legislatures in South Carolina.  Another set of issues brought up was the multitude of expensive decorative items and embellishments that were purchased for the refurbishment of the State House.  White legislatures were generally left out of the criticisms, despite their own contributions, and were referred to as victims of corruption due to the influence of black people.\nOthers believed that Black Reconstruction was not to blame for all corruption in legislation.  This faction of people saw the constructive debates and conversations that flowed within the southern legislations.  They were also more receptive to the positive aspects and characteristics of black legislatures that were displayed during their time in office.\nDespite the amount of eager participants, this period eventually led to a decline in black participation in politics.  The backlash of those against increase of black participation in politics effectively began to cause the number of participants to stop and then decline.  Today, despite past involvement, black participation in politics is low.  Black participation is not a common occurrence in comparison to overall participation and is often celebrated when a black candidate or politician does particularly well in their political endeavors.  This decline is attributed to a white counterattack of the Black Reconstruction movement.  Many methods were used to dissuade blacks from taking office.  One of the most prominent was violence.  An example of that would be the Ku Klux Klan, a secretive group whose members all believed in white supremacy.  The lynching, beatings, and intimidation of black people helped to hasten the decline of black participation in politics. Coercion was also another method used to dissuade black participation in politics, particularly voting.  Threats of loss jobs and refusal of medical care are some of the coercion methods employed.  Coercion did not play as big of a role as direct physical violence however it did serve to further hinder the growth of black participation in politics.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ladenburg|first1=Thomas|last2=McFeely|first2=William|title=The Black Man in the Land of Equality|date=1969|publisher=Hayden Book Company, INC|location=New York|oclc=53860}}</ref>  These methods helped to forge a political system that has a scarce amount of minorities in office.\n\n==== Representation ====\nBlack representation in Congress had been scarce with less than eight Blacks in Congress per Congressional periods since the [[41st Congress|end of the Civil War]] up until the [[91st Congress|Nixon era]] when there were 11 Black representatives (ten in the House and one in the Senate).

This led to an emphasis on the acquisition of Aboriginal lands in exchange for the putative benefits of European society and their associated Christian religions. British control of Canada (the [[Monarchy of Canada|Crown]]) began when they exercised jurisdiction over the first nations and it was by Royal Proclamation that the first piece of legislation the British government passed over First Nations citizens assumed control of their lives. It gave recognition to the Indians tribes as First Nations living under Crown protection.\n\nIt was after the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|treaty of Paris In 1763]], whereby France ceded all claims in present-day Canada to Britain, that King George III of Great Britain issued this Royal Proclamation specifying how the Indigenous in the [[Monarchy of Canada|crown]] colony were to be treated. It is the most significant pieces of legislation regarding the [[Monarchy of Canada|Crown]]'s relationship with Aboriginal people. This Royal Proclamation recognized Indian owned lands and reserved to them all use as their hunting grounds. It also established the process by which the [[Monarchy of Canada|Crown]] could purchase their lands, and also laid out basic principles to guide the Crown when making treaties with the First Nations. The Proclamation made Indian lands transferred by treaty to be Crown property, and stated that indigenous title is a collective or communal rather than a private right so that individuals have no claim to lands where they lived and hunted long before the British came.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cidh.org/countryrep/Indigenous-Lands09/Chap.V-VI.htm|title=Indigenous and Tribal People's Rights Over Their Ancestral Lands and Natural Resources|author=|date=|website=cidh.org|accessdate=15 June 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Indian Acts===\n\nIn 1867, the [[British North America Acts|British North America Act]] made [[Indian Reserve (1763)|land reserved for Indians]] a [[Monarchy of Canada|Crown]]  responsibility.

Despite the evident detriment to the M\u00e9tis, speculation was rampant and done in collusion with the distribution of scrip.  While this does not necessarily preclude a malicious intent by the federal government to consciously 'cheat' the M\u00e9tis, it illustrates their apathy towards the welfare of the M\u00e9tis, their long-term interests, and the recognition of their Aboriginal title.  But the point of the policy was to settle land in the North-West with agriculturalists, not keep a land reserve for the M\u00e9tis.

Indigenous people could gain the right to vote and become Canadian citizens, \"persons\" under the law, by voluntarily assimilating into European/Canadian society.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/An_Act_to_encourage_the_gradual_Civilization_of_the_Indian_Tribes_in_this_Province,_and_to_amend_the_Laws_respecting_Indians|title=An Act to encourage the gradual Civilization of the Indian Tribes in this Province, and to amend the Laws respecting Indians|via=Wikisource}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://eco.canadiana.ca/view/oocihm.9_07030|title=Bill : an act to encourage the gradual civiliza... - cover - Early Canadiana Online|author=Canadiana|date=|work=canadiana.ca|accessdate=26 October 2015}}</ref> \nIt was hoped that indigenous peoples would renounce their native heritage and culture and embrace the 'benefits' of civilized society. Indeed, from the 1920s to the 1940s some Natives did give up their status in order to receive the right to go to school, vote or to drink. However, voluntary enfranchisement proved a failure when few natives took advantage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://signatoryindian.tripod.com/routingusedtoenslavethesovereignindigenouspeoples/id10.html|title=2. 1857 - Gradual civilization of the Indian tribes- Enfranchisement Scheme|work=signatoryindian.tripod.com|accessdate=21 February 2018}}</ref>\nIn 1920 a law was passed to authorize enfranchisement without consent, and many Aboriginal peoples were involuntarily enfranchised. Natives automatically lost their Indian status under this policy and also if they became professionals such as doctors or ministers, or even if they obtained university degrees, and with it, their right to reside on the reserves.\n\nThe enfranchisement requirements particularly discriminated against Native women, specifying in Section 12 (1)(b) of the Indian Act that an Indian status woman marrying a non Indian man would lose her status as an Indian, as would her children. In contrast non Indian women marrying Indian men would gain Indian status.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://openparliament.ca/bills/41-1/C-31|title=Bill C-31 (Historical)|date=|work=openparliament.ca|accessdate=26 October 2015}}</ref>\n[[Duncan Campbell Scott]], the Deputy Superintendent of Indian Affairs, neatly expressed the sentiment of the day in 1920:\n\"Our object is to continue until there is not a single Indian in Canada that has not been absorbed into the body politic, and there is no Indian question and no Indian Department\"\nThis aspect of enfranchisement was addressed by passage of Bill C-31 in 1985,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://indigenousfoundations.web.arts.ubc.ca/bill_c-31/|title=Bill C-31|website=indigenousfoundations.web.arts.ubc.ca}}</ref> where the discriminatory clauses of the Indian Act was removed, and Canada officially gave up the goal of enfranchising Natives.\n\n===Residential schools===\n\nWith the goal of civilizing and Christianizing Aboriginal populations, a system of 'industrial schools' was developed in the 19th century which combined academic studies with \"more practical matters\" and schools for Natives began to appear in the 1840s. From 1879 on these schools were modelled after the [[Carlisle Indian Industrial School|Carlisle Indian School]] in Pennsylvania, whose motto was \"[[Kill the Indian, Save the Man|Kill the Indian in him and save the man]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://waynekspear.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/residential-schools.gif|title=Image of students|author=|date=|website=wordpress.com|accessdate=27 March 2018}}</ref> It was felt that the most effective weapon for \"killing the Indian\" in them, was to remove children from their Native supports and so Native children were taken away from their homes, their parent, their families, friends and communities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.culturalsurvival.org/publications/cultural-survival-quarterly/canada/indian-residential-school-truth-and-reconciliation-c|title=Indian Residential School Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada|work=Cultural Survival|accessdate=12 July 2015}}</ref>\nThe 1876 Indian Act gave the federal government responsibility for Native education and by 1910 residential schools dominated the Native education policy. The government provided funding to religious groups such as the Catholic, Anglican, United Church and Presbyterian churches to undertake Native education. By 1920, attendance by natives was made compulsory and there were 74 residential schools operating nationwide. Following the ideas of [[Clifford Sifton|Sifton]] and others like him, the academic goals of these schools were \"dumbed down\". As [[Duncan Campbell Scott]] stated at the time, they didn't want students that were \"made too smart for the Indian villages\":<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.danielnpaul.com/IndianResidentialSchools.html|title=Indian Residential Schools - Cultural Genocide|accessdate=12 July 2015}}</ref>\n\"To this end the curriculum in residential schools has been simplified and the practical instruction given is such as may be immediately of use to the pupil when he returns to the reserve after leaving school.\"\n\nThe funding the government provided was generally insufficient and often the schools ran themselves as \"self-sufficient businesses\", where 'student workers' were removed from class to do the laundry, heat the building or perform farm work. Dormitories were often poorly heated and overcrowded, and the food was less than adequately nutritious. A 1907 report, commissioned by [[Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada|Indian Affairs]], found that in 15 prairie schools there was a death rate of 24%.<ref name=\"waynekspear.com\">{{cite web|url=http://waynekspear.com/2010/03/10/indian-residential-schools-2/|title=Indian Residential Schools|work=Wayne K. Spear - Writer|accessdate=12 July 2015}}</ref> Indeed, a deputy superintendent general of Indian Affairs at the time commented:\n\"It is quite within the mark to say that fifty percent of the children who passed through these schools did not benefit from the education which they had received therein.\"\nWhile the death rate did decline in later years, death would remain a part of the residential school tradition. The author of that report to the [[Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada|BNA]], [[Peter Bryce|Dr. P.H. Bryce]], was later removed and in 1922 published a pamphlet<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/storyofnationalc00brycuoft#page/n5/mode/2up|title=The story of a national crime : being an appeal for justice to the Indians of Canada; the wards of the nation, our allies in the Revolutionary War, our brothers-in-arms in the Great War|accessdate=12 July 2015}}</ref> that came close to calling the governments indifference to the conditions of the Indians in the schools 'manslaughter'.<ref name=\"waynekspear.com\"/>\n\nThe worst aspect of Canada's residential schools, and that which anthropologists [[John Steckley|Steckley]] and Cummins said \"might readily qualify as the single-worst thing that Europeans did to Natives in Canada\" was the endemic abuses;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abebooks.com/book-search/author/steckley-john/signed|title=Steckley John, Signed|date=12 July 1981|accessdate=12 July 2015}}</ref> emotional, physical and sexual, for which they are now known. Punishments were often brutal and cruel, sometimes even life-threatening or life-ending.

Criminal and civil suits against the government and the churches began in the late 1980s and shortly thereafter the last residential school closed. By 2002 the number of lawsuits had passed 10,000. In the 1990s, beginning with the United Church, the churches that ran the residential schools began to issue formal apologies. And in 1998 the Canadian government issued the Statement of [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (Canada)|Reconciliation]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trc.ca/websites/trcinstitution/index.php?p=3|title=TRC|accessdate=12 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304082611/http://www.trc.ca/websites/trcinstitution/index.php?p=3|archive-date=4 March 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> and committed $350 million in support of a community-based healing strategy to address the healing needs of individuals, families and communities arising from the legacy of physical and sexual abuse at residential schools. The money was used to launch the Aboriginal Healing Foundation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ahf.ca|title=Announcements - Aboriginal Healing Foundation|accessdate=12 July 2015}}</ref>\n\n<!-- ===Conclusion===\n\nThe overt institutional racism of the past has clearly had a profoundly devastating and lasting effect on visible minorities and Aboriginal communities throughout Canada. European cultural norms have imposed themselves on Native populations in Canada, and Aboriginal communities continue to struggle with foreign systems of governance, of justice, of education, and of livelihood. Visible Minorities struggle with education, employment and negative contact with the legal system across Canada.\n\nPerhaps most palpable is the dysfunction and familial devastation caused by residential schools. Hutchins states;<ref name=\"tolerance.cz\"/> \"Many of those who attended residential schools have been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, suffering from such symptoms as panic attacks, insomnia, and uncontrollable or unexplainable anger. Many also suffer from alcohol or drug abuse, sexual inadequacy or addiction, the inability to form intimate relationships, and eating disorders. Three generations of Native parents lost out on learning important parenting skills usually passed on from parent to child in caring and nurturing home environments, and the abuse suffered by students of residential schools has begun a distressing cycle of abuse within many Native communities.\" The lasting legacy of residential schools is but only one facet of the problem.<ref>Canada's Forced Schooling of Aboriginal Children Was 'Cultural Genocide,' Report Finds\". NY Times. 2 June 2015. Retrieved 2 June 2015</ref>\n\nThe hutchins report continues; \"Aboriginal children continue to struggle with mainstream education in Canada. For some Indian students, English remains a second language, and many lack parents with sufficient education themselves to support them. Moreover, education in Canada is premised on a written tradition, quite different from the oral tradition of Native communities. For others, it is simply that they are ostracised for their 'otherness'; their manners, their attitudes, their speech or a hundred other things which mark them out as different. \nAboriginal populations continue to suffer from poor health. They have seven years less life expectancy than the overall Canadian population and almost twice as many infant deaths. While Canada as a nation routinely ranks in the top three on the United Nations Human Development Index,<ref>http://hdr.undp.org/sites/default/files/reports/270/hdr_2010_en_complete_reprint.pdf</ref> its on-reserve Aboriginal population, if scored as a nation, would rank a distant and shocking sixty-third.\"\n\nAs [[Phil Fontaine]] National Chief, Assembly of First Nations, points out, racism in Canada today is for the most part, a covert operation. Its central and most distinguishing characteristic is the vigour with which it is consistently denied. There are many who argue that Canada's endeavours in the field of human rights and its stance against racism have only resulted in a \"more politically correct population who have learnt to better conceal their prejudices\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://prezi.com/b9p1qzffl466/privilege/|title=Privilege|work=prezi.com|accessdate=12 July 2015}}</ref> In effect, the argument is that racism in Canada is not being eliminated, but rather is becoming more covert, more rational and perhaps more deeply imbedded in our institutions. \nThat racism is alive is evidenced by the recent referendum in British Columbia by which the provincial government is asking the white majority to decide on a mandate for negotiating treaties with the Indian minority.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/ILB/2002/33.html|title=Kajlich, Helena --- \"The British Columbia Treaty Referendum: An Appropriate Democratic Exercise?\" [2002] IndigLawB 33; (2002) 5(17) Indigenous Law Bulletin 11|publisher=|accessdate=12 July 2015}}</ref> The results of the referendum will be binding,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.turtleisland.org/news/news-bctreaty-referendum1.htm|title=British Columbia Treaty referendum|publisher=|accessdate=12 July 2015}}</ref> the government having legislatively committed itself to act on these principles if more than 50% of those voting reply in the same way.

This policy was enforced with the support of various Christian churches, who ran many of the schools. Over the course of the system's existence, approximately 30% of native children, roughly some 150,000, were placed in residential schools nationally, with the last school closing in 1996. There has long been controversy about the conditions experienced by students in the residential schools. While day schools for First Nations, Metis, and Inuit children always far outnumbered residential schools, a new consensus emerged in the early 21st century that the latter schools did significant harm to Aboriginal children who attended them by removing them from their families, depriving them of their ancestral languages, undergoing forced sterilization for some students, and by exposing many of them to physical leading to sexual abuse by staff members, and other students, and dis-enfranchising them forcibly.<ref>{{cite web|last=Harper |first=Stephen |authorlink=Stephen Harper |title=Statement of apology to former students of Indian Residential Schools |url=https://www.aadnc-aandc.gc.ca/eng/1100100015644/1100100015649 |website=Indian and Northern Affairs Canada |accessdate=May 7, 2017 |language=en |date=June 11, 2008 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170516080220/http://www.aadnc-aandc.gc.ca/eng/1100100015644/1100100015649 |archivedate=May 16, 2017 }}</ref>\n\nStarting in the 1990s, the government started a number of initiatives to address the effects of the Indian residential school. In March 1998, the government made a Statement of Reconciliation and established the Aboriginal Healing Foundation. In the fall of 2003, the Alternative Dispute Resolution process was launched, which was a process outside of court providing compensation and psychological support for former students of residential schools who were physically or sexually abused or were in situations of wrongful confinement. On June 11, 2008, Prime Minister Stephen Harper issued a formal apology on behalf of the sitting Cabinet and in front of an audience of Aboriginal delegates. A [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (Canada)|Truth and Reconciliation Commission]] ran from 2008 through to 2015 in order to document past wrongdoing in the hope of resolving conflict left over from the past.<ref>{{cite web|title=14.12 Elimination of Racial and Ethnic Stereotyping, Identification of Groups|url=http://www.btb.termiumplus.gc.ca/tcdnstyl-srch?lang=eng&srchtxt=indigenous&cur=2&nmbr=2&lettr=14&info0=14.12#zz14|website=Translation Bureau|publisher=Public Works and Government Services Canada|accessdate=April 30, 2017|language=en|year=2017}}</ref>\n\n==Algeria==\n{{main|Pacification of Algeria}}\n\nFrench political thinker [[Alexis de Tocqueville]] (1805\u201359) supported colonization in general, and in particular the colonization of Algeria. In several speeches on France's foreign affairs, and in two official reports presented to the National Assembly in March 1847 on behalf of an ad hoc commission, he also repeatedly commented on and analysed the issue in his voluminous correspondence. In short, De Tocqueville developed a theoretical basis for French expansion in North Africa.<ref>See De la colonie en Alg\u00e9rie, Complexe, Brussels, 1988, and Nous et les Autres, Seuil, Paris, 1989, \"Tocqueville\", pp 219-234.</ref> He even studied the Koran, sharply concluding that the religion of Muhammad was \"the main cause of the decadence ... of the Muslim world\". His opinions are also instructive about the early years of the French conquest and how the colonial state was first set up and organized. De Tocqueville emerged as an early advocate of \"total domination\" in Algeria and subsequent \"devastation of the country\".<ref>Alexis de Tocqueville, Travail sur l'Alg\u00e9rie, op cit, pp 699 and 706.</ref>  On 31 January 1830 when Charles X captured Algiers the French state thus began what became the institutional racism directed at the Kabyle, or Berbers, of Arab descent in north Africa. The [[Dey of Algiers]] had insulted the monarchy by slapping the French ambassador with a fly whisk and the French used this pretext to invade, and also put an end to [[piracy]] in the vicinity. The unofficial objective was to restore the prestige of the French crown and gain a foothold in North Africa, thereby preventing the British gaining advantage over France in the Mediterranean. The [[July Monarchy]], which came to power in 1831, inherited this burden. The next 9 years saw the indigenous population subjected to the [[Abdelkader El Djezairi|might]] of the French army. By 1840 more conservative elements gained control of the government and they dispatched General Thomas Bugeaud, the newly appointed governor of the colony, to [[French Algeria|Algeria]], marking the real start of the country's conquest. The methods employed were atrocious. The army deported villagers en masse; massacred the men and raped women; took the children hostage, stole livestock and harvests and destroyed orchards. De Tocqueville wrote, \"I believe the laws of war entitle us to ravage the country and that we must do this, either by destroying crops at harvest time, or all the time by making rapid incursions, known as raids, the aim of which is to carry off men and flocks.\"<ref>Alexis de Tocqueville, Travail sur l'Alg\u00e9rie in Oeuvres compl\u00e8tes, Paris, Gallimard, Biblioth\u00e8que de la Pl\u00e9iade, 1991, pp 704 and 705.</ref> He added: \"In France I have often heard people I respect, but do not approve, deplore [the army] burning harvests, emptying granaries and seizing unarmed men, women and children. As I see it, these are unfortunate necessities that any people wishing to make war on the Arabs must accept.\"<ref>In a work that seeks to defend the army's excesses, Pierre Montagnon wrote of the victims: \"500,000? A million? The truth must lie somewhere between these figures. Anything less would be to play down a terrible reality,\" La conqu\u00eate de l'Alg\u00e9rie, Paris, Pygmalion, 1986, p 414. If we compare these figures with historian Denise Bouche's estimate of the total population in 1830 at \"about three million people\", the scale of the massacres becomes clearer; see her Histoire de la colonisation fran\u00e7aise, volume 2, Paris, Fayard, 1998, p 23.</ref> He also advocated that \"all political freedoms must be suspended in Algeria\".<ref>Olivier LeCour Grandmaison (2001). \"Tocqueville et la conqu\u00eate de l'Alg\u00e9rie\" (in French). La Mazarine.</ref> [[Marshal Bugeaud]], who was the first governor-general as he was also heading the civil gov't, was rewarded by the King for the conquest, having instituted the [[French conquest of Algeria|systemic]] use of torture and following a \"[[scorched earth]]\" policy against the Arab population.\n\n===Land grab===\n\nOnce the conquest of Algiers was accomplished soldier-politician [[Bertrand Clauzel]] and others formed a company to acquire agricultural land and, despite official discouragement, to subsidize its settlement by European farmers, which triggered a [[land rush]]. He became governor general in 1835 and used his office to make private investments in land, encouraging bureaucrats and army officers in his administration to do the same. This development created a vested interest among government officials in greater French involvement in Algeria. Merchants with influence in the government also saw profit in land speculation which resulted in expanding the French occupation. Large agricultural tracts were carved out, factories and businesses began exploiting cheap local labor and also to benefit from laws and edicts that gave control to the French. The policy of limited occupation was formally abandoned in 1840 for one of complete control. By 1843, De Tocqueville intended to protect and extend expropriation by the [[rule of law]]. He therefore advocated setting up special courts, based on what he called \"summary\" procedure, to carry out massive expropriation for the benefit of French and other European settlers who would thus be able to purchase land at an attractive price and live in villages that the colonial government had equipped with fortifications, churches, schools and even fountains. His belief, which framed his writings and influenced state actions, was that the local people, who had been driven out by the army and robbed of their land by the judges, would gradually die out.\n\nThe French colonial state, as he conceived it and as it took shape in Algeria, was a two-tiered organization, quite unlike the regime in mainland France. It introduced two different political and legal systems which, in the last analysis, were based on racial, cultural and religious distinctions. According to De Tocqueville, the system that should apply to the colonizers would enable them alone to hold property and travel freely, but would deprive them of any form of political freedom, which should be suspended in Algeria. \"There should therefore be two quite distinct legislations in Africa, for there are two very separate communities. There is absolutely nothing to prevent us treating Europeans as if they were on their own, as the rules established for them will only ever apply to them\".<ref>Alexis de Tocqueville, Travail sur l'Alg\u00e9rie, op cit, p 752.</ref>\n\nFollowing the defeats of the Muslim army in the 1840s colonization continued apace. By 1848, Algeria was populated by 109,400 Europeans, only 42,274 of which were French.<ref>Sessions, Jennifer (2011). By Sword and Plow: France and the Conquest of Algeria.

The [[Colonialism|colonials]] imposed more and higher taxes on [[Muslims]] than on [[Europeans]].<ref>Alistair Horne, page 63 \"A Savage War of Peace\", {{ISBN|0-670-61964-7}}</ref> The Muslims, in addition to paying traditional taxes dating from before the French conquest, also paid new taxes, from which the colons were normally exempted. In 1909, for instance, [[Muslims]], who made up almost 90% of the population but produced 20% of Algeria's income, paid 70% of direct taxes and 45% of the total taxes collected. And colons controlled how these revenues would be spent. As a result, colon towns had handsome municipal buildings, paved streets lined with trees, fountains and statues, while Algerian villages and rural areas benefited little if at all from tax revenues.\n\n===In education===\n\nThe colonial regime proved severely detrimental to overall education for Algerian Muslims, who had previously relied on religious schools to learn reading, writing, and engage in religious studies. Not only did the state appropriate the habus lands (the religious foundations that constituted the main source of income for religious institutions, including schools) in 1843, but colon officials refused to allocate enough money to maintain schools and mosques properly and to provide for enough teachers and religious leaders for the growing population. In 1892, more than five times as much was spent for the education of Europeans as for Muslims, who had five times as many children of school age. Because few Muslim teachers were trained, Muslim schools were largely staffed by French teachers. Even a state-operated [[madrasa]]h often had French faculty members. Attempts to institute [[bilingual]], [[bicultural]] schools, intended to bring Muslim and European children together in the classroom, were a conspicuous failure, rejected by both communities and phased out after 1870. According to one estimate, fewer than 5% of Algerian children attended any kind of school in 1870. As late as 1954 only one Muslim boy in five and one girl in sixteen was receiving formal schooling.<ref>Alistair Horne, pages 60-61 \"A Savage War of Peace\", {{ISBN|0-670-61964-7}}</ref> Efforts were begun by 1890 to educate a small number of Muslims along with European students in the French school system as part of France's \"civilizing mission\" in Algeria. The curriculum was entirely French and allowed no place for Arabic studies, which were deliberately downgraded even in Muslim schools. Within a generation, a class of well-educated, gallicized Muslims \u2013 the [[Nationalism and resistance in Algeria|\u00e9volu\u00e9s]] (literally, the evolved ones) \u2013 had been created.\n\n===Enfranchisement===\nFollowing its conquest of [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] controlled Algeria in 1830, for well over a century France maintained [[colonial rule]] in the territory which has been described as \"quasi-apartheid\".<ref>\"Algeria was in fact a colony but constitutionally was a part of France and not thought of in the 1950s as a colony.

Institutional racism had its early roots here due to interactions between these islanders who had Melanesian origins and depended on the sea for sustenance whose land rights were abrogated; and later the Australian Aboriginal peoples whose children were removed from their families by Australian Federal and State government agencies and church missions, under acts of their respective parliaments.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stolengenerations123.wikispaces.com/Emergence+of+the+child+removal+policy|title=stolengenerations123 - Emergence of the child removal policy|accessdate=12 July 2015}}</ref> The removals occurred in the period between approximately 1909 and 1969.

In the remote communities, the report cited 71% of the population in these remote discrete indigenous communities lacked access to public transportation and 78% of the communities were more than 50 miles from the nearest hospital. Although English is the official language of Australia, many indigenous Australians do not speak it as a primary language and the lack of printed materials that are translated into the Aboriginal languages and the non-availability of translators form a barrier to adequate health care for the Aborigines.

[[William Macpherson (judge)|Sir William Macpherson]] used the term as a description of \"the collective failure of an organisation to provide an appropriate and professional service to people because of their colour, culture or ethnic origin\", which \"can be seen or detected in processes, attitudes, and behaviour, which amount to discrimination through unwitting prejudice, ignorance, thoughtlessness, and racist stereotyping, which disadvantages minority ethnic people\".<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/lawrence/Story/0,,941167,00.html \"Metropolitan police still institutionally racist\"], [[The Guardian]], 22 April 2003</ref> Sir William's definition is almost identical to Stokely Carmichael's original definition some forty years earlier. Stokely Carmichael and Charles Hamilton 1967 were black power activists and first used the term 'institutional racism' to describe the consequences of a societal structure that was stratified into a racial hierarchy that resulted in layers of discrimination and inequality for minority ethnic people in housing, income, employment, education and health (Garner 2004:22).<ref name=\"Blagg2008\">{{cite book|last=Blagg|first=Harry|title=Crime, Aboriginality and the Decolonisation of Justice|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ojyQTjn8FFgC&pg=PA9|date=1 January 2008|publisher=Hawkins Press|isbn=978-1-876067-19-9|page=9}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Stephen Lawrence#The Stephen Lawrence Inquiry Report|Stephen Lawrence Inquiry Report]], and the public's response to it, were among the major factors that forced the [[Metropolitan Police]] to address its treatment of ethnic minorities. More recently, the former [[Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis|Metropolitan Police Commissioner]], [[Ian Blair|Sir Ian Blair]] said that the British news media are institutionally racist,<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/4651368.stm \"Met chief accuses media of racism\"], [[BBC]], 26 January 2006</ref> a comment that offended journalists, provoking angry responses from the media, despite the [[National Black Police Association (UK)|National Black Police Association]] welcoming Blair's assessment.<ref>[http://media.guardian.co.uk/site/story/0,14173,1696070,00.html?gusrc=rss \"Met chief labels media institutionally racist\"], [[The Guardian]], 27 January 2006</ref>\n\nThe report also found that the Metropolitan Police was institutionally racist. A total of 70 recommendations for reform were made. These proposals included abolishing the double jeopardy rule and criminalising racist statements made in private. Macpherson also called for reform in the British Civil Service, local governments, the National Health Service, schools, and the judicial system, to address issues of institutional racism.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Holdaway | first1 = Simon | last2 = O'Neill | first2 = Megan | year = 2006 | title = Institutional Racism after Macpherson: An Analysis of Police Views | url = | journal = Policing and Society | volume = 16 | issue = 4| pages = 349\u2013369 | doi = 10.1080/10439460600967885 }}</ref>\n\nIn June 2015, the [[Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis|Metropolitan Police Commissioner]], [[Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe]], said there was some justification in claims that the Metropolitan Police Service is institutionally racist.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-33025853|title=Met acknowledges 'some justification' to claims the force is 'racist'|publisher=BBC News |date=5 June 2015|accessdate=22 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Criminal conviction===\nWhile problems with the treatment of minorities in criminal investigations were found institutional, another aspect of criminal conviction crossed the line, affecting both white and black convicts. For 7 years, the courts in the U.K. handed down sentences for minor crimes that resulted in virtual life in prison. By 2012, the use of [[Imprisonment for public protection|IPP]] sentence guidelines were curtailed, however, three years after the sentences were abolished, more than three fourths of the 4,612 IPP prisoners still jailed in the system have passed the minimum sentence term set by the court. 200 more have been in prison for nearly a decade \u2013 despite being given a minimum sentence of less than two years.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.vice.com/article/exclusive-vice-news-investigates-the-uks-4500-prisoners-doing-life-for-minor-crimes|title=Exclusive: VICE News Investigates the UK's 4,500 Prisoners Doing Life for Minor Crimes|date=|work=VICE News|accessdate=26 October 2015}}</ref> These guidelines were introduced to keep criminals behind bars until they were no longer deemed a risk to the public, but where their crimes did not warrant a fixed life sentence. Although they were designed for the most dangerous offenders, IPP sentences were given out for relatively minor crimes including affray (fighting in public), minor criminal damage worth less than 20 pounds, and shoplifting. They were ended in 2012 after the [[European Court of Human Rights]] ruled that all prisoners had the right to know how long they were being held for. UK courts stopped handing out the sentences, but the ban did nothing to impact those already serving an IPP.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://you.38degrees.org.uk/petitions/free-the-remaining-ipp-prisoners?source=twitter-share-button|title=Free the remaining Ipp prisoners.|date=|work=Campaigns by You|accessdate=26 October 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn a kafkaesque turn, many cannot be released as they cannot complete the courses required as a condition of release due to them not being offered, and paperwork to conclude parole hearings is not prepared before the hearings, only after the hearing is concluded due to lack of paperwork.

Those marked as black were further discriminated against differentially, with Africans facing more extreme forms of exclusion and exploitation than those marked as coloured or Indian. One such example of institutional racism in South Africa is [[Natives Land Act, 1913]], which reserved 90% of land for white use and the Native Urban Areas Act of 1923 controlled access to urban areas, which suited commercial farmers who were keen to hold labour on their land. Africans, who formed the majority of the population, were relegated to barren\nrural reserves, which later became homelands.<ref>Bozalek, Vivienne. \"[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Vivienne_Bozalek/publication/258185153_The_Effect_of_Institutional_Racism_on_Student_Family_Circumstances_A_Human_Capabilities_Perspective/links/545bacb90cf249070a7a7a7e.pdf The Effect of Institutional Racism on Student Family Circumstances: A Human Capabilities Perspective].\" South African Journal of Psychology 40.4 (2010): 487-494.
