Du Bois]].{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|pp=366\u2013367}}\n\nMore recently it has been active on social conservative issues, including [[opposition to same-sex marriage]], [[abortion]], [[divorce]], and [[birth control]], including requiring employers to provide it in violation of their religious beliefs. It has also been critical of the [[Immigration policy of Donald Trump|President Donald Trump's immigration policy]], and supportive of immigrants and refugees. Both in the United States and around the world, it has defended [[religious freedom]]. \n\n==Background==\nThe [[Knights of Columbus]] were active politically from an early date. In the years following the [[Second Vatican Council]], however, according to Christopher Kauffman, the Catholic anti-defamation character of the order began to diminish as Catholics became more accepted, and the leadership attempted to stimulate the membership to a greater awareness of the religious and moral issues confronting the Church. That led to the creation of a \"variety of new programs reflecting the proliferation of the new social ministries of the church\".{{sfn|Kauffman|1982}}\n\nIn December 2018, during the confirmation process of nominee [[Brian C. Buescher]] to the [[United States district court|U.S. District Court]], \"liberal\" Senator Mazie K. Hirono<ref name=\"Mazie Hirono on the Issues\">{{cite web |title=Mazie Hirono on the Issues |publisher=On the Issues |access-date=November 18, 2018 |url=http://www.ontheissues.org/house/Mazie_Hirono.htm }}]</ref> characterized the position the Knights of Columbus have taken on social issues as \"extreme\" and asked Buescher, \"If confirmed, do you intend to end your membership with this organization to avoid any appearance of bias?\"<ref name=jud>[https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Buescher%20Responses%20to%20QFRs.pdf \"Nomination of Brian Buescher to the United States District Court for the District of Nebraska Questions for the Record December 5, 2018\", Judiciary.senate.gov.]</ref> Senator [[Kamala Harris]] also asked about opinions held by the organization and asked Buescher if he was aware these views when he joined the Knights of Columbus.

To destroy the church's influence over the Mexican people, anti-clerical statutes were inserted into the Constitution, beginning a 10-year persecution of Catholics that resulted in the deaths of thousands, including [[List of Knights of Columbus#Saints|several priests who were also Knights of Columbus]]. Leaders of the order began speaking out against the Mexican government. ''Columbia'', the official magazine of the Knights, published articles critical of the regime. After the November 1926 cover of ''Columbia'' portrayed Knights carrying a banner of liberty and warning of \"The Red Peril of Mexico,\" the Mexican legislature banned both the order and the magazine throughout the country.<ref name=\"Pelowski\" />\n\nIn 1926, the Massachusetts State Council passed a resolution opposing the Mexican government and in defense of human rights.{{sfn|Lapomarda|1992|p=37}} Ten days later, State Deputy [[Edmund J.

Roosevelt]] and other government officials, to send the children to live with Basque families who had fled to France so that the children could speak their own language and practice their own religion.{{sfn|Crosby|p=97|1971}} If the children did come to the United States, the Knights and the [[Catholic Order of Foresters]] said they would try to place the children in Catholic homes.{{sfn|Crosby|p=97|1971}}\n\nThe Knights supported the embargo on all arms into Spain.<ref name=\"Tierney2007\" /> To remove it, they said, would be to aid a \"vicious and despotic government\" who had forced their own citizens to flee to escape \"annihilation or slavery.\"<ref name=\"Tierney2007\" /> They also opposed the screening of documentaries that were used to recruit volunteers and raise funds for the loyalists.{{sfn|Rob\u00e9|2010|p=83}} The Knights believed these films were pro-Marxist and anti-Catholic, and as a result wrote to [[Will H.

the 20th century and especially the [[Cold War]], the order had a history of anti-anarchist, anti-socialist and [[anti-communism|anti-communist]] crusades.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|pp=364\u2013365}} It also established the Commission on Religious Prejudices and the Knights of Columbus Historical Commission to combat racism.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|pp=366\u2013367}} It was supportive of [[trade unionism]] and published the works of men including [[George Ernest Schuster|George Schuster]], [[Samuel Flagg Bemis]], [[Allan Nevins]], and [[W.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;B. Du Bois]].{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|pp=366\u2013367}}\n\nMore recently it has been active on social conservative issues, including [[opposition to same-sex marriage]], [[abortion]], [[divorce]], and [[birth control]], including requiring employers to provide it in violation of their religious beliefs. It has also been critical of the [[Immigration policy of Donald Trump|President Donald Trump's immigration policy]], and supportive of immigrants and refugees. Both in the United States and around the world, it has defended [[religious freedom]]. \n\n==Background==\nThe [[Knights of Columbus]] were active politically from an early date. In the years following the [[Second Vatican Council]], however, according to Christopher Kauffman, the Catholic anti-defamation character of the order began to diminish as Catholics became more accepted, and the leadership attempted to stimulate the membership to a greater awareness of the religious and moral issues confronting the Church. That led to the creation of a \"variety of new programs reflecting the proliferation of the new social ministries of the church\".{{sfn|Kauffman|1982}}\n\nIn December 2018, during the confirmation process of nominee [[Brian C.

To destroy the church's influence over the Mexican people, anti-clerical statutes were inserted into the Constitution, beginning a 10-year persecution of Catholics that resulted in the deaths of thousands, including [[List of Knights of Columbus#Saints|several priests who were also knights of Columbus]]. Leaders of the order began speaking out against the Mexican government. ''Columbia'', the official magazine of the Knights, published articles critical of the regime. After the November 1926 cover of ''Columbia'' portrayed Knights carrying a banner of liberty and warning of \"The Red Peril of Mexico,\" the Mexican legislature banned both the order and the magazine throughout the country.<ref name=\"Pelowski\" />\n\nIn 1926, the Massachusetts State Council passed a resolution opposing the Mexican government and in defense of human rights.{{sfn|Lapomarda|1992|p=37}} Ten days later, State Deputy [[Edmund J.

Supplementation of arachidonic acid (1,500&nbsp;mg/day for 8 weeks) has been shown to increase lean body mass, strength, and anaerobic power in experienced resistance-trained men. This was demonstrated in a placebo-controlled study at the University of Tampa. Thirty men (aged 20.4 \u00b1 2.1 years) took arachidonic acid or a placebo for 8 weeks, and participated in a controlled resistance-training program. After 8 weeks, lean body mass (LBM) had increased significantly, and to a greater extent, in the ARA group (1.62&nbsp;kg) vs. placebo (0.09&nbsp;kg) (p<0.05). The change in muscle thickness was also greater in the ARA group (.47&nbsp;cm) than placebo (.25&nbsp;cm) (p<0.05). Wingate anaerobic power increased to a greater extent in ARA group as well (723.01 to 800.66 W) vs. placebo (738.75 to 766.51 W). Lastly, the change in total strength was significantly greater in the ARA group (109.92&nbsp;lbs.) compared to placebo (75.78&nbsp;lbs.). These results suggest that ARA supplementation can positively augment adaptations in strength and skeletal muscle hypertrophy in resistance-trained men.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ormes|first1=Jacob|title=Effects of Arachidonic Acid Supplementation on Skeletal Muscle Mass, Strength, and Power|url=http://www.eventscribe.com/2014/posters/nsca/SplitViewer.asp?PID=NzkzNjA1MjQx|website=NSCA ePoster Gallery|publisher=National Strength and Conditioning Association}}</ref>\n\nAn earlier clinical study examining the effects of 1,000&nbsp;mg/day of arachidonic acid for 50 days found supplementation to enhance anaerobic capacity and performance in exercising men.

Supplementation of arachidonic acid (1,500&nbsp;mg/day for 8 weeks) has been shown to increase lean body mass, strength, and anaerobic power in experienced resistance-trained men. This was demonstrated in a placebo-controlled study at the University of Tampa. Thirty men (aged 20.4 \u00b1 2.1 years) took arachidonic acid or a placebo for 8 weeks, and participated in a controlled resistance-training program. After 8 weeks, lean body mass (LBM) had increased significantly, and to a greater extent, in the ARA group (1.62&nbsp;kg) vs. placebo (0.09&nbsp;kg) (p<0.05). The change in muscle thickness was also greater in the ARA group (.47&nbsp;cm) than placebo (.25&nbsp;cm) (p<0.05). Wingate anaerobic power increased to a greater extent in ARA group as well (723.01 to 800.66 W) vs. placebo (738.75 to 766.51 W). Lastly, the change in total strength was significantly greater in the ARA group (109.92&nbsp;lbs.) compared to placebo (75.78&nbsp;lbs.). These results suggest that ARA supplementation can positively augment adaptations in strength and skeletal muscle hypertrophy in resistance-trained men.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ormes|first1=Jacob|title=Effects of Arachidonic Acid Supplementation on Skeletal Muscle Mass, Strength, and Power|url=http://www.eventscribe.com/2014/posters/nsca/SplitViewer.asp?PID=NzkzNjA1MjQx|website=NSCA ePoster Gallery|publisher=National Strength and Conditioning Association}}</ref>\n\nAn earlier clinical study examining the effects of 1,000&nbsp;mg/day of arachidonic acid for 50 days found supplementation to enhance anaerobic capacity and performance in exercising men.

Maintaining sufficient intake levels of both omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, therefore, is recommended for optimal health.\n\nArachidonic acid is not [[carcinogen]]ic, and studies show dietary level is not associated (positively or negatively) with risk of cancers.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Schuurman |first1=AG |last2=Van Den Brandt |first2=PA |last3=Dorant |first3=E |last4=Brants |first4=HA |last5=Goldbohm |first5=RA |title=Association of energy and fat intake with prostate carcinoma risk: results from The Netherlands Cohort Study |journal=Cancer |volume=86 |issue=6 |pages=1019\u201327 |year=1999 |pmid=10491529 |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1097-0142(19990915)86:6<1019::AID-CNCR18>3.0.CO;2-H}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Leitzmann |first1=MF |last2=Stampfer |first2=MJ |last3=Michaud |first3=DS |last4=Augustsson |first4=K |last5=Colditz |first5=GC |last6=Willett |first6=WC |last7=Giovannucci |first7=EL |title=Dietary intake of n-3 and n-6 fatty acids and the risk of prostate cancer |journal=The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition |volume=80 |issue=1 |pages=204\u201316 |year=2004 |pmid=15213050}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Astorg |first1=P |title=Dietary fatty acids and colorectal and prostate cancers: epidemiological studies |journal=Bulletin du cancer |volume=92 |issue=7 |pages=670\u201384 |year=2005 |pmid=16123006}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Whelan |first1=J |last2=McEntee |first2=MF |title=Dietary (n-6) PUFA and intestinal tumorigenesis |journal=The Journal of Nutrition |volume=134 |issue=12 Suppl |pages=3421S\u20133426S |year=2004 |pmid=15570048}}</ref> ARA remains integral to the inflammatory and cell growth process, however, which is disturbed in many types of disease including cancer.

With possible early examples or direct predecessors in the 13th to 14th century, the familiar symbol of the heart represented love developed in the 15th century, and became popular in Europe during the 16th.<ref>Kemp (2011), 96\u201399.</ref> Before the 14th century, the heart shape was not associated with the meaning of the heart metaphor. The geometric shape itself is found in much earlier sources, but in such instances does not depict a heart, but typically foliage: in examples from antiquity [[Common fig|fig]] leaves, and in medieval iconography and heraldry typically the leaves of [[Hedera|ivy]] and of the [[Nymphaeaceae|water-lily]]. One possible early use in the 11th century could be found in the manuscript, Al-Maqamat written by [[Al-Hariri of Basra|Al Hariri of Basra]]. The manuscript includes an [https://medieval.tumblr.com/image/108488126380 illustration] of a farewell greeting between two men while astride their camels, with the heart shape seen prominently over their heads.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.topic.com/the-pleasure-principles|title=The Pleasure Principles|publisher=}}</ref>{{Not in refs|date=November 2019}}<!--Heart symbol not mentioned, over their heads could be circles as well.-->\n\nThe first known depiction of a heart as a symbol of romantic love dates to the 1250s. It occurs in a miniature decorating a capital 'S' in a manuscript of the French ''[[Roman de la poire]]'' (National Library FR MS. 2086, plate 12). In the miniature a kneeling lover (or more precisely, an allegory of the lover's \"sweet gaze\" or ''douz regart'') offers his heart to a damsel. The heart here resembles a pine cone (held \"upside down\", the point facing upward), in accord with medieval anatomical descriptions. However, in this miniature what suggests a heart shape is only the result of a lover's finger superimposed on an object; the full shape outline of the object is partly hidden, and therefore unknown. Moreover, the French title of the manuscript that features the miniature translates into \"Novel Of The Pear\" in English. Thus the heart shaped object would be a pear; the conclusion that a pear represents a heart is dubious. Opinions therefore differ over this being the first depiction of a heart as symbol of romantic love.<ref name=\"Vinken 2001\">Vinken (2001).</ref> [[Giotto]] in his 1305 painting in the [[Scrovegni Chapel]] ([[Padua]]) shows an [[Charity (virtue)|allegory of charity]] (caritas) handing her heart to [[Jesus]] [[Christ (title)|Christ]]. This heart is also depicted in the pine cone shape based on anatomical descriptions of the day (still held \"upside down\"). Giotto's painting exerted considerable influence on later painters, and the motive of Caritas offering a heart is shown by [[Taddeo Gaddi]] in Santa Croce, by [[Andrea Pisano]] on the bronze door of the south porch of the Baptisterium in Florence (c. 1337), by [[Ambrogio Lorenzetti]] in the Palazzo Publico in Siena (c. 1340) and by [[Andrea da Firenze]] in Santa Maria Novella in Florence (c. 1365). The convention of showing the heart point upward switches in the late 14th century and becomes rare in the first half of the 15th century.<ref name=\"Vinken 2001\"/>\n\nThe \"scalloped\" shape of the now-familiar heart symbol, with a dent in its base, arises in the early 14th century, at first only lightly dented, as in the miniatures in Francesco Barberino's ''[[c:File:Documenti_d'amore_(1640)_(14747564815).jpg#file|Documenti d'amore]] ''(before 1320). A slightly later example with a more pronounced dent is found in a manuscript from the [[Cistercians|Cistercian]] monastery in Brussels (MS 4459\u201370, fol 192v. [[Royal Library of Belgium]]). The convention of showing a dent at the base of the heart thus spread at about the same time as the convention of showing the heart with its point downward.<ref>Vinken (2001): \"The change from the spherical to the scalloped form of the heart base happened more or less in train with the differing way in which the heart was held, and has dominated visual representations of the heart ever since.\"</ref> The modern indented red heart has been used on [[playing card]]s since the late 15th century.<ref>A Brief History of Playing Cardes, by Charles Knutson, Renaissance Magazine 2001 {{cite web |url=http://www.renaissancemagazine.com/backissues/game.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101220111738/http://renaissancemagazine.com/backissues/game.html |archivedate=2010-12-20 }}</ref>\n\nVarious hypotheses attempted to connect the \"heart shape\" as it evolved in the [[Late Middle Ages]] with instances of the geometric shape in antiquity.<ref name=\"mcdonell\">[http://www.slate.com/id/2159800/?GT1=9129 The Shape of My Heart: Where did the ubiquitous Valentine's symbol come from?] by Keelin McDonell, [[Slate (magazine)|Slate.com]], Tuesday, Feb. 13, 2007.</ref> Such theories are modern, proposed from the 1960s onward, and they remain speculative, as no continuity between the supposed ancient predecessors and the late medieval tradition can be shown.

With possible early examples or direct predecessors in the 13th to 14th century, the familiar symbol of the heart represented love developed in the 15th century, and became popular in Europe during the 16th.<ref>Kemp (2011), 96\u201399.</ref> Before the 14th century, the heart shape was not associated with the meaning of the heart metaphor. The geometric shape itself is found in much earlier sources, but in such instances does not depict a heart, but typically foliage: in examples from antiquity [[Common fig|fig]] leaves, and in medieval iconography and heraldry typically the leaves of [[Hedera|ivy]] and of the [[Nymphaeaceae|water-lily]]. One possible early use in the 11th century could be found in the manuscript, Al-Maqamat written by [[Al-Hariri of Basra|Al Hariri of Basra]]. The manuscript includes an [https://medieval.tumblr.com/image/108488126380 illustration] of a farewell greeting between two men while astride their camels, with the heart shape seen prominently over their heads.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.topic.com/the-pleasure-principles|title=The Pleasure Principles|publisher=}}</ref>{{Not in refs|date=November 2019}}<!--Heart symbol not mentioned, over their heads could be circles as well.-->\n\nThe first known depiction of a heart as a symbol of romantic love dates to the 1250s. It occurs in a miniature decorating a capital 'S' in a manuscript of the French ''[[Roman de la poire]]'' (National Library FR MS. 2086, plate 12). In the miniature a kneeling lover (or more precisely, an allegory of the lover's \"sweet gaze\" or ''douz regart'') offers his heart to a damsel. The heart here resembles a pine cone (held \"upside down\", the point facing upward), in accord with medieval anatomical descriptions. However, in this miniature what suggests a heart shape is only the result of a lover's finger superimposed on an object; the full shape outline of the object is partly hidden, and therefore unknown. Moreover, the French title of the manuscript that features the miniature translates into \"Novel Of The Pear\" in English. Thus the heart shaped object would be a pear; the conclusion that a pear represents a heart is dubious. Opinions therefore differ over this being the first depiction of a heart as symbol of romantic love.<ref name=\"Vinken 2001\">Vinken (2001).</ref> [[Giotto]] in his 1305 painting in the [[Scrovegni Chapel]] ([[Padua]]) shows an [[Charity (virtue)|allegory of charity]] (caritas) handing her heart to [[Jesus]] [[Christ (title)|Christ]]. This heart is also depicted in the pine cone shape based on anatomical descriptions of the day (still held \"upside down\"). Giotto's painting exerted considerable influence on later painters, and the motive of Caritas offering a heart is shown by [[Taddeo Gaddi]] in Santa Croce, by [[Andrea Pisano]] on the bronze door of the south porch of the Baptisterium in Florence (c. 1337), by [[Ambrogio Lorenzetti]] in the Palazzo Publico in Siena (c. 1340) and by [[Andrea da Firenze]] in Santa Maria Novella in Florence (c. 1365). The convention of showing the heart point upward switches in the late 14th century and becomes rare in the first half of the 15th century.<ref name=\"Vinken 2001\"/>\n\nThe \"scalloped\" shape of the now-familiar heart symbol, with a dent in its base, arises in the early 14th century, at first only lightly dented, as in the miniatures in Francesco Barberino's ''[[c:File:Documenti_d'amore_(1640)_(14747564815).jpg#file|Documenti d'amore]] ''(before 1320). A slightly later example with a more pronounced dent is found in a manuscript from the [[Cistercians|Cistercian]] monastery in Brussels (MS 4459\u201370, fol 192v. [[Royal Library of Belgium]]). The convention of showing a dent at the base of the heart thus spread at about the same time as the convention of showing the heart with its point downward.<ref>Vinken (2001): \"The change from the spherical to the scalloped form of the heart base happened more or less in train with the differing way in which the heart was held, and has dominated visual representations of the heart ever since.\"</ref> The modern indented red heart has been used on [[playing card]]s since the late 15th century.<ref>A Brief History of Playing Cardes, by Charles Knutson, Renaissance Magazine 2001 {{cite web |url=http://www.renaissancemagazine.com/backissues/game.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101220111738/http://renaissancemagazine.com/backissues/game.html |archivedate=2010-12-20 }}</ref>\n\nVarious hypotheses attempted to connect the \"heart shape\" as it evolved in the [[Late Middle Ages]] with instances of the geometric shape in antiquity.<ref name=\"mcdonell\">[http://www.slate.com/id/2159800/?GT1=9129 The Shape of My Heart: Where did the ubiquitous Valentine's symbol come from?] by Keelin McDonell, [[Slate (magazine)|Slate.com]], Tuesday, Feb. 13, 2007.</ref> Such theories are modern, proposed from the 1960s onward, and they remain speculative, as no continuity between the supposed ancient predecessors and the late medieval tradition can be shown.

''[[Super Mario Bros. 2]]'' (1987, 1988) had a \"life bar\" composed of [[hexagon]]s, but in 1990s remakes of these games, the hexagons were replaced by heart shapes. Since the 1990s, the heart symbol has also been used as an ideogram indicating health outside of the video gaming context, e.g. its use by restaurants to indicate heart-healthy nutrient content claim (e.g. \"low in [[cholesterol]]\"). A copyrighted \"heart-check\" symbol to indicate heart-healthy food was introduced by the [[American Heart Association]] in 1995.<ref>\"the heart-check mark that began to appear on a wide array of food packaging in 1995. The symbol consists of a heart branded with a bold, efficient check mark.

However, while the charges are clearly heart-shaped, they did not in origin depict hearts, or symbolize any idea related to love. Instead they are assumed to have depicted the leaves of the [[Nymphaeaceae|water-lily]]. Early heraldic heart-shaped charges depicting the leaves of water-lilies are found in various other designs related to territories close to rivers or a coastline (''e.g.'' [[Flags of Frisia]]).\n\nInverted heart symbols have been used in heraldry as stylized [[testicle]]s (''coglioni'' in Italian) as in the [[canting arms]] of the [[Colleoni]] family of Milan.<ref name=\"Woodward\">Woodward, John and George Burnett (1969).

He is a transgender activist, and uses he/him and they/them pronouns.\n\nSchofield has won awards for his performances and work in film, tv, theatre, and digital productions.  In addition to performing, he has produced, written, directed, and consulted on several projects in film, tv, digital content, and theatre.\n\nSchofield received a Tanne Award for Artistic Excellence from the Tanne Foundation in 2004. The Tanne Award is given to performers who passionately make a difference in this country through their performing.\n\nIn 2008, a collection of Schofield's three solo performance scripts was published by Homofactus Press titled \"Two Truths and a Lie\". Judith Halberstam wrote the foreword. The book was a finalist for the Lambda Literary Awards in the Drama and Transgender categories; it was placed on the American Library Association's 2009 Rainbow List.\n\nSchofield's work as an activist and public speaker has focused on education in regard to transgender issues and awareness.  He has assisted in the creation of training programs, institutional support programs, and nondiscrimination policies in educational, government, and corporate settings.\n\n<br />\n\n==Filmography==\nScott Turner Schofield has appeared in films ranging from art house shorts to major feature length releases; including the Antonia Brico biopic 'The Conductor', directed by Maria Peters.  He is currently filming 'Becoming a Man in 127 EASY Steps' with Andrea James which is based on his award winning live performance art piece of the same name.\n\n* \n*\n*\n*In Production: \"''Becoming a Man in 127 EASY Steps\"'' - Directed and executive produced by Andrea James (Expected release 2021)\n* \n* \n* 2017: \"''Transmute''\" - Chris - Star Victoria \u00a0\n* 2018: \"''The Conductor''\" (\"''De Dirigent''\")- Robin - Director Maria Peter\u00b9\n*\n*\n\n== Theatre ==\nSchofield has a varied background in theatre as a performer, writer, director, and artistic director.\n\nHe is best known for a trilogy of critically acclaimed autobiographical works, which focus on the life experience of being Queer and transitioning.  \"Underground Transit\": A spoken word performance taking on academic Queer Theory in the real life of one transition. \u00a0\"Debutante Balls\": A  performance piece on coming out into Southern Society as a lesbian, radical feminist, and finally, as a transgender man.  The award winning \"Becoming a Man in 127 EASY Steps\" which includes short stories, songs, and short films that center an epic trans life--before, during, and 20 years beyond transition.\n\nIn 2007 Schofield was honored by the Princess Grace Foundation-USA, where he received the Gant Gaither Award, a theater fellowship in acting.  Schofield carried out his fellowship at 7 Stages in Atlanta, where he worked as the assistant to French director Eric Vigner on Bernard Marie Koltes' play \"In the Solitude of Cotton Fields\"; with German actress Anne Tismer on \"Gutes Tun/Doing Good Things\"; and with American actress/director Crystal Dickinson on Pearl Cleage's play \"A Song for Coretta\".  Schofield also became the first openly transgender creator to receive a National Performance Network Creation Fund to produce \"Becoming a Man in 127 EASY Steps\".  The commission was supported by The Pat Graney Company in Seattle, DiverseWorks in Houston, and 7 Stages in Atlanta.\n\nIn 2010, after an interim role in 2009, Schofield became the Artistic Director of Out North Contemporary Art House in Anchorage Alaska.  He curated 3 seasons of performance, film, music, and visual arts. Schofield accepted an ACLU Award as a Hero for Constitutional Rights on behalf of Out North's founders, volunteers, and artists in 2011.  During his tenure as Artistic Director he conceived of the Art House Residency Program.  The program was subsequently funded for $250,000 by ArtPlace America.\n\nIn May 2012, Schofield moved to France to work again with Eric Vigner on a play by Christophe Honor\u00e9 titled \"La Facult\u00e9\".  He worked with the Academy of the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de Lorient and actress Yutta Weiss on the world premiere at the 2012 Festival d'Avignon.  The play was also performed at the National Theatres of France, touring France in the 2012-13 season to Lorient, Toulouse, Clermont-Ferrand, Reims, and Orleans.\n\n===Festival Performances===\n\n\u2022  2012: ''Morphologies: Queer Performance Festival'' - Minneapolis\n\n\u2022  2011: ''Festival d\u2019Avignon'' (Mainstage) - Avignon\n\n\u2022  2009: ''Festival des Libert\u00e9s'' - Brussels - Headliner\n\n\u2022  2007: ''Fresh Fruit Festival'' - NYC - Winner Best Off-Broadway Performance, Audience Choice\n\n\u2022  2007: ''National Performance Network -''  Annual Meeting - Seattle\n\n\u2022  2004: ''Single File Festival'' - Chicago\n\n\u2022  2004: ''SEEN+HEARD Festival'' - Atlanta\n\n\u2022  2003: ''FUSE: the NYC Celebration of Queer''  \n\nCulture\n\n\u2022  2003: ''Alternate R.O.O.T.S -'' Annual Meeting - Winder\n\n\u2022  2002: ''SEEN+HEARD Festival'' - Atlanta\n\n\u2022  2002: ''Philadelphia Fringe Festival'' - Adjudicated\n\n===Theatre Performances===\n\n\u2022  2018: ''\"A Kind of Weather\"'' - Kid - \u00a0Director: Eric Hoff - Kirk Douglas Theatre, Los Angeles.

The classic example is [[Spectre (security vulnerability)|Spectre]] who gave his name to this kind of [[Side-channel attack|side-channel attack]], but since January 2018 many different vulnerabilities have been identified.\n\n== Overview ==\n\nModern computers are highly parallel devices, composed of components with very different performance characteristics. If an operation (such as a branch) cannot yet be performed because some earlier slow operation (such as a memory read) has not yet completed, a microprocessor may attempt to ''predict'' the result of the earlier operation and execute the later operation ''speculatively'', acting as if the prediction was correct. The prediction may be based on recent behavior of the system. When the earlier, slower operation completes, the microprocessor determines whether prediction was correct or incorrect. If it was correct then execution proceeds uninterrupted; if it was incorrect then the microprocessor rolls back the speculatively executed operations and repeats the original instruction with the real result of the slow operation. Specifically, a ''transient instruction'' <ref>{{cite web|url=https://spectreattack.com/spectre.pdf |title=Spectre Attacks: Exploiting Speculative Execution |access-date=2020-04-16 |last1=Kocher |first1=Paul |last2=Horn |first2=Jann |last3=Fogh |first3=Anders |last4=Genkin |first4=Daniel |last5=Gruss |first5=Daniel}}</ref> refers to an instruction processed by error by the processor (incriminating the branch predictor in the case of [[Spectre]]) which can affect the micro-architectural state of the processor, leaving the architectural state without any trace of its execution.\n\nIn terms of the directly visible behavior of the computer it is as if the speculatively executed code \"never happened\". However, this speculative execution may affect the state of certain components of the microprocessor, such as the [[Cache (computing)|cache]], and this effect may be discovered by careful monitoring of the timing of subsequent operations.\n\nIf an attacker can arrange that the speculatively executed code (which may be directly written by the attacker, or may be a suitable [[Return-oriented programming|''gadget'']] that they have found in the targeted system) operates on secret data that they are unauthorized to access, and has a different effect on the cache for different values of the secret data, they may be able to discover the value of the secret data.\n\nStarting in 2017, multiple examples of such vulnerabilities were identified, with publication starting in early 2018.\n\n== Summary of vulnerabilities ==\nHardware mitigations impose close to zero performance loss, while microcode and/or OS mitigations might incur quite a significant performance loss (depending on workload).\n\nVarious CPU microarchitectures not included in this table are also affected, among them are [[IBM POWER microprocessors|IBM Power]], [[ARM architecture|ARM]], [[MIPS architecture|MIPS]] and others.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wiki.netbsd.org/security/meltdown_spectre/|title=Meltdown and Spectre Status Page|website=wiki.netbsd.org|access-date=2019-09-29}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://developer.arm.com/support/arm-security-updates/speculative-processor-vulnerability/latest-updates/cache-speculation-issues-update|title=Speculative Processor Vulnerability {{!}} Cache Speculation Issues Update|last=Ltd|first=Arm|website=ARM Developer|language=en|access-date=2019-09-29}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208394|title=About speculative execution vulnerabilities in ARM-based and Intel CPUs|website=Apple Support|language=en|access-date=2019-09-29}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ibm.com/blogs/psirt/potential-impact-processors-power-family/|title=Potential Impact on Processors in the POWER Family|date=2019-05-14|website=IBM PSIRT Blog|language=en-US|access-date=2019-09-29}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 90%; width: 100%\" \n|+\n! rowspan=\"3\" |Vulnerability\n! rowspan=\"3\" |N\n! rowspan=\"3\" |CVE\n! rowspan=\"3\" |Public Vulnerability Name\n(codename)\n! colspan=\"7\" |Affected CPU architectures and mitigations\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" |Intel<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/engineering-new-protections-into-hardware.html|title=Engineering New Protections Into Hardware|website=Intel|language=en|access-date=2019-06-12}}</ref>\n! colspan=\"2\" |AMD<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amd.com/en/corporate/product-security|title=AMD Product Security {{!}} AMD|date=2019-08-10|archive-date=2019-08-10|access-date=2019-08-10}}</ref>\n|-\n![[Ice Lake (microarchitecture)|Ice Lake]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.anandtech.com/show/14664/testing-intel-ice-lake-10nm/3|title=The Ice Lake Benchmark Preview: Inside Intel's 10nm|last=Cutress|first=Dr Ian|website=www.anandtech.com|access-date=2019-08-01}}</ref>\n![[Cascade Lake (microarchitecture)|Cascade Lake]],\n[[Comet Lake]]\n![[Whiskey Lake (microarchitecture)|Whiskey Lake]],\n[[Amber Lake (microarchitecture)|Amber Lake]]\n![[Coffee Lake#List of 9th generation Coffee Lake processors|Coffee Lake]] (9th gen)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/Intel-Core-i9-9900K-mit-8-Kernen-und-5-GHz-fuer-Gamer-4183783.html|title=Intel Core i9-9900K mit 8 Kernen und 5 GHz f\u00fcr Gamer|last=online|first=heise|website=heise online|language=de-DE|access-date=2018-10-09}}</ref>\n![[Coffee Lake]] (8th gen)*\n![[Zen (microarchitecture)|Zen 1]] / [[Zen+|Zen 1+]]\n![[Zen 2]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.anandtech.com/show/14525/amd-zen-2-microarchitecture-analysis-ryzen-3000-and-epyc-rome|title=AMD Zen 2 Microarchitecture Analysis: Ryzen 3000 and EPYC Rome|last=Cutress|first=Ian|website=www.anandtech.com|access-date=2019-06-11}}</ref>\n|-\n|Spectre\n|1\n|[https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-5753 2017-5753]\n|[[Bounds Check Bypass]]\n| colspan=\"5\" {{No|[[Operating system|OS]]/[[Hypervisor|VMM]]}}\n| rowspan=\"2\" {{No|Microcode + OS/VMM}}\n| rowspan=\"2\" {{No|Hardware + OS/VMM}}\n|-\n|Spectre\n|2\n|[https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-5715 2017-5715]\n|[[Branch Target Injection]]\n|colspan=\"2\" {{No|Hardware + OS}}\n|{{No|[[Microcode]] + OS}}\n|colspan=\"2\" {{No|Microcode + OS}}\n|-\n|SpectreRSB<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/woot18/woot18-paper-koruyeh.pdf |title=Spectre Returns!

(security vulnerability)|Speculative Store Bypass|Lazy FP state restore|Bounds Check Bypass Store|Microarchitectural Data Sampling|Load value injection}}\n\n'''Transient execution CPU vulnerabilities''' are vulnerabilities in a computer system in which a [[speculative execution]] optimization implemented in a [[microprocessor]] is exploited to leak secret data to an unauthorized party. The classic example is [[Spectre (security vulnerability)|Spectre]] who gave his name to this kind of [[Side-channel attack|side-channel attack]], but since January 2018 many different vulnerabilities have been identified.\n\n== Overview ==\n\nModern computers are highly parallel devices, composed of components with very different performance characteristics. If an operation (such as a branch) cannot yet be performed because some earlier slow operation (such as a memory read) has not yet completed, a microprocessor may attempt to ''predict'' the result of the earlier operation and execute the later operation ''speculatively'', acting as if the prediction was correct. The prediction may be based on recent behavior of the system. When the earlier, slower operation completes, the microprocessor determines whether prediction was correct or incorrect. If it was correct then execution proceeds uninterrupted; if it was incorrect then the microprocessor rolls back the speculatively executed operations and repeats the original instruction with the real result of the slow operation. Specifically, a ''transient instruction'' <ref>{{cite web|url=https://spectreattack.com/spectre.pdf |title=Spectre Attacks: Exploiting Speculative Execution |access-date=2020-04-16 |last1=Kocher |first1=Paul |last2=Horn |first2=Jann |last3=Fogh |first3=Anders |last4=Genkin |first4=Daniel |last5=Gruss |first5=Daniel}}</ref> refers to an instruction processed by error by the processor (incriminating the branch predictor) which can affect the micro-architectural state of the processor, leaving the architectural state without any trace of its execution.\n\nIn terms of the directly visible behavior of the computer it is as if the speculatively executed code \"never happened\". However, this speculative execution may affect the state of certain components of the microprocessor, such as the [[Cache (computing)|cache]], and this effect may be discovered by careful monitoring of the timing of subsequent operations.\n\nIf an attacker can arrange that the speculatively executed code (which may be directly written by the attacker, or may be a suitable [[Return-oriented programming|''gadget'']] that they have found in the targeted system) operates on secret data that they are unauthorized to access, and has a different effect on the cache for different values of the secret data, they may be able to discover the value of the secret data.\n\nStarting in 2017, multiple examples of such vulnerabilities were identified, with publication starting in early 2018.\n\n== Summary of vulnerabilities ==\nHardware mitigations impose close to zero performance loss, while microcode and/or OS mitigations might incur quite a significant performance loss (depending on workload).\n\nVarious CPU microarchitectures not included in this table are also affected, among them are [[IBM POWER microprocessors|IBM Power]], [[ARM architecture|ARM]], [[MIPS architecture|MIPS]] and others.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wiki.netbsd.org/security/meltdown_spectre/|title=Meltdown and Spectre Status Page|website=wiki.netbsd.org|access-date=2019-09-29}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://developer.arm.com/support/arm-security-updates/speculative-processor-vulnerability/latest-updates/cache-speculation-issues-update|title=Speculative Processor Vulnerability {{!}} Cache Speculation Issues Update|last=Ltd|first=Arm|website=ARM Developer|language=en|access-date=2019-09-29}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208394|title=About speculative execution vulnerabilities in ARM-based and Intel CPUs|website=Apple Support|language=en|access-date=2019-09-29}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ibm.com/blogs/psirt/potential-impact-processors-power-family/|title=Potential Impact on Processors in the POWER Family|date=2019-05-14|website=IBM PSIRT Blog|language=en-US|access-date=2019-09-29}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 90%; width: 100%\" \n|+\n! rowspan=\"3\" |Vulnerability\n! rowspan=\"3\" |N\n! rowspan=\"3\" |CVE\n! rowspan=\"3\" |Public Vulnerability Name\n(codename)\n! colspan=\"7\" |Affected CPU architectures and mitigations\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" |Intel<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/engineering-new-protections-into-hardware.html|title=Engineering New Protections Into Hardware|website=Intel|language=en|access-date=2019-06-12}}</ref>\n! colspan=\"2\" |AMD<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amd.com/en/corporate/product-security|title=AMD Product Security {{!}} AMD|date=2019-08-10|archive-date=2019-08-10|access-date=2019-08-10}}</ref>\n|-\n![[Ice Lake (microarchitecture)|Ice Lake]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.anandtech.com/show/14664/testing-intel-ice-lake-10nm/3|title=The Ice Lake Benchmark Preview: Inside Intel's 10nm|last=Cutress|first=Dr Ian|website=www.anandtech.com|access-date=2019-08-01}}</ref>\n![[Cascade Lake (microarchitecture)|Cascade Lake]],\n[[Comet Lake]]\n![[Whiskey Lake (microarchitecture)|Whiskey Lake]],\n[[Amber Lake (microarchitecture)|Amber Lake]]\n![[Coffee Lake#List of 9th generation Coffee Lake processors|Coffee Lake]] (9th gen)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/Intel-Core-i9-9900K-mit-8-Kernen-und-5-GHz-fuer-Gamer-4183783.html|title=Intel Core i9-9900K mit 8 Kernen und 5 GHz f\u00fcr Gamer|last=online|first=heise|website=heise online|language=de-DE|access-date=2018-10-09}}</ref>\n![[Coffee Lake]] (8th gen)*\n![[Zen (microarchitecture)|Zen 1]] / [[Zen+|Zen 1+]]\n![[Zen 2]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.anandtech.com/show/14525/amd-zen-2-microarchitecture-analysis-ryzen-3000-and-epyc-rome|title=AMD Zen 2 Microarchitecture Analysis: Ryzen 3000 and EPYC Rome|last=Cutress|first=Ian|website=www.anandtech.com|access-date=2019-06-11}}</ref>\n|-\n|Spectre\n|1\n|[https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-5753 2017-5753]\n|[[Bounds Check Bypass]]\n| colspan=\"5\" {{No|[[Operating system|OS]]/[[Hypervisor|VMM]]}}\n| rowspan=\"2\" {{No|Microcode + OS/VMM}}\n| rowspan=\"2\" {{No|Hardware + OS/VMM}}\n|-\n|Spectre\n|2\n|[https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-5715 2017-5715]\n|[[Branch Target Injection]]\n|colspan=\"2\" {{No|Hardware + OS}}\n|{{No|[[Microcode]] + OS}}\n|colspan=\"2\" {{No|Microcode + OS}}\n|-\n|SpectreRSB<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/woot18/woot18-paper-koruyeh.pdf |title=Spectre Returns!

She participated in their first album ''Before the Libretto'' on the Quecksilber label in 2005.\n\nSince 2004 she has dedicated herself to works for acoustic instruments. First with the American cellist [[Charles Curtis (musician)|Charles Curtis]], the first part of ''Naldjorlak'' was premiered in December 2005 in New York and later played in 25 concerts across the U.S. and Europe. The second part of ''Naldjorlak'' for the two [[basset horn]] players Carol Robinson and Bruno Martinez, was created in September 2007 at the [[Aarau]] Festival (Switzerland). The three musicians completed the third part of ''Naldjorlak'' with Radigue and premiered the complete work, \"Naldjorlak I,II,III\", in Bordeaux on January 24, 2009.

His parents were Filippo Pacelli (1837\u20131916) and Virginia (n\u00e9e Graziosi) Pacelli (1844\u20131920).

Soon after the family had moved to Via Vetrina in 1880 he began school at the convent of the French [[Sisters of Divine Providence]] in the Piazza Fiammetta. The family worshipped at [[Santa Maria in Vallicella|Chiesa Nuova]]. Eugenio and the other children made their [[First Communion]] at this church and Eugenio served there as an [[altar boy]] from 1886. In 1886 too he was sent to the private school of Professor Giuseppe Marchi, close to the [[Piazza Venezia]].<ref>Paul O'Shea, A Cross Too Heavy, 2011, p. 79</ref> In 1891 Pacelli's father sent Eugenio to the Liceo Ennio Quirino Visconti Institute, a state school situated in what had been the [[Collegio Romano]], the premier Jesuit university in Rome.\n\nIn 1894, aged 18, Pacelli began his theology studies at Rome's oldest seminary, the [[Almo Collegio Capranica]],<ref>O'Shea, p. 81</ref> and in November of the same year, registered to take a philosophy course at the Jesuit [[Pontifical Gregorian University]] and theology at the [[Pontifical Roman Athenaeum S. Apollinare]]. He was also enrolled at the [[University of Rome La Sapienza|State University, La Sapienza]] where he studied modern languages and history. At the end of the first academic year however, in the summer of 1895, he dropped out of both the Capranica and the Gregorian University. According to his sister Elisabetta, the food at the Capranica was to blame.<ref>Cornwell, p. 22</ref> Having received a special dispensation he continued his studies from home and so spent most of his seminary years as an external student. In 1899 he completed his education in Sacred Theology with a doctoral degree awarded on the basis of a short dissertation and an oral examination in [[Latin]].<ref>Cornwell, p. 23</ref>\n\n==Church career==\n\n===Priest and Monsignor===\n[[File:Pacelliordenado.jpg|thumb|upright|150px|Pacelli on the day of his ordination: 2 April 1899]]\nWhile all other candidates from the Rome diocese were ordained in the [[Basilica of St. John Lateran]],<ref name=\"Gerard Noel, p.9\">Noel, p. 9</ref> Pacelli was [[Holy Orders|ordained]] a priest on [[Easter Sunday]], 2 April 1899 alone in the private chapel of a family friend the [[Vicegerent]] of Rome, [[Francesco di Paola Cassetta|Mgr Paolo Cassetta]].

At this time Serbia, encouraged by Russia, was challenging [[Austria-Hungary]]'s sphere of influence throughout the [[Balkans]]. Pius X died on 20 August 1914.

She later wrote, \"Thinking back today on that time, when we Germans still all believed that our weapons would be victorious and the Nuncio was deeply sorry that the chance had been missed to save what there was to save, it occurs to me over and over again how clearly he foresaw what was to come.

He negotiated food shipments for Russia, where the Church was persecuted.

Pacelli supported German diplomatic activity aimed at rejection of punitive measures from victorious former enemies. He blocked French attempts for an ecclesiastical separation of the [[Saar (League of Nations)|Saar region]], supported the appointment of a papal administrator for [[Danzig]] and aided the reintegration of priests expelled from Poland.<ref>Morsey, p. 121</ref> A Prussian Concordat was signed on 14 June 1929.

In 1935, Pacelli was named [[Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church]].\n\nAs Cardinal Secretary of State, Pacelli signed concordats with a number of countries and states. Immediately on becoming Cardinal Secretary of State, Pacelli and Ludwig Kaas took up negotiations on a [[Baden]] Concordat which continued until the spring and summer of 1932. Papal fiat appointed a supporter of Pacelli and his concordat policy, [[Conrad Gr\u00f6ber]], the new [[Archbishop of Freiburg]], and the treaty was signed in August\n1932.<ref>Kent, 2002, p. 24</ref> Others followed: Austria (1933), Germany (1933), [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] (1935) and Portugal (1940). The [[Lateran treaties]] with Italy (1929) were concluded before Pacelli became Secretary of State. Catholicism had become the sole recognized religion; the powerful democratic [[Italian People's Party (1919)|Catholic Popular Party]], in many ways similar to the Centre Party in Germany, had been disbanded, and in place of political Catholicism the Holy See encouraged [[Catholic Action]], \"an anaemic form of clerically dominated religious rally-rousing\". It was permitted only so long as it developed \"its activity outside every political party and in direct dependence upon the Church hierarchy for the dissemination and implementation of Catholic principles\".<ref>Cornwell, p. 115</ref> Such concordats allowed the Catholic Church to organize youth groups, make ecclesiastical appointments, run schools, hospitals, and charities, or even conduct religious services. They also ensured that canon law would be recognized within some spheres (e.g., church decrees of [[Nullity (conflict)|nullity]] in the area of marriage).<ref>Fahlbusch, Erwin (ed.).

''The Encyclopedia of Christianity''; {{ISBN|0-8028-2416-1}}</ref>\n\nAs the decade began Pacelli wanted the Centre Party in Germany to turn away from the socialists. In the summer of 1931 he clashed with Catholic chancellor [[Heinrich Bruning]], who frankly told Pacelli he believed that he \"misunderstood the political situation in Germany and the real character of the Nazis\".<ref>Cornwell, p. 121</ref> Following Bruning's resignation in May 1932 Pacelli, like the new Catholic chancellor [[Franz von Papen]], wondered if the Centre Party should look to the Right for a coalition, \"that would correspond to their principles\".<ref>Cornwell, p. 128. Pacelli, quoted in Scholder's ''The Churches and the Third Reich'', p. 157</ref> He made many diplomatic visits throughout Europe and the Americas, including an [[Eugenio Pacelli's 1936 visit to the United States|extensive visit to the United States in 1936]] where he met President [[Franklin D.

The state concordats were necessary because the German [[federalism|federalist]] Weimar constitution gave the German states authority in the area of education and culture and thus diminished the authority of the churches in these areas; this diminution of church authority was a primary concern of the Vatican. As Bavarian Nuncio, Pacelli negotiated successfully with the Bavarian authorities in 1925. He expected the concordat with Catholic Bavaria to be the model for the rest of Germany.<ref name=\"Volk\">Ludwig Volk, Die Kirche in den deutschsprachigen L\u00e4ndern in: ''Handbuch der Kirchengeschichte, Band VII'', p. 539</ref><ref>Donald J.

However, Pacelli obtained less favorable conditions for the Church in the Prussian concordat of 1929, which excluded educational issues. A concordat with the German state of Baden was completed by Pacelli in 1932, after he had moved to Rome. There he also negotiated a concordat with Austria in 1933.<ref>Volk, pp. 539\u2013544</ref> A total of 16 concordats and treaties with European states had been concluded in the ten-year period 1922\u20131932.<ref>They included: Latvia 1922, Bavaria 1925, Poland 1925, France I., 1926, France II. 1926, Lithuania 1927, Czechoslovakia 1928, Portugal I 1928, Italy I 1929, Italy II 1929, Portugal II 1929, Romania I 1927, Prussia 1929, Romania II 1932, Baden 1932, Germany 1933, Austria 1933.

It remains the most important of Pacelli's concordats. It is debated, not because of its content, which is still valid today, but because of its timing. A national concordat with Germany was one of Pacelli's main objectives as secretary of state, because he had hoped to strengthen the legal position of the Church. Pacelli, who knew German conditions well, emphasized in particular protection for Catholic associations (\u00a731), freedom for education and Catholic schools, and freedom for publications.<ref>Ludwig Volk, \"Die Kirche in den deutschsprachigen L\u00e4ndern\" in: ''Handbuch der Kirchengeschichte, Band VII'', pp. 546\u2013547</ref>\n\nAs [[nuncio]] during the 1920s, he had made unsuccessful attempts to obtain German agreement for such a treaty, and between 1930 and 1933 he attempted to initiate negotiations with representatives of successive German governments, but the opposition of Protestant and Socialist parties, the instability of national governments and the care of the individual states to guard their autonomy thwarted this aim. In particular, the questions of denominational schools and pastoral work in the armed forces prevented any agreement on the national level, despite talks in the winter of 1932.<ref>Ludwig Volk ''Das Reichskonkordat vom 20.

Most notably, early in 1937, Pacelli asked several German cardinals, including Cardinal [[Michael von Faulhaber]] to help him write a protest of Nazi violations of the ''Reichskonkordat''; this was to become Pius XI's 1937 encyclical, ''[[Mit brennender Sorge]]''. The encyclical was written in German and not the usual [[Latin]] of official Catholic Church documents.

Smuggled into Germany, it was read from all the Catholic pulpits on Palm Sunday in March 1937. It exposed the fallacy and denounced the Nazi myth of blood and soil; it decried its neopaganism, its war of annihilation against the Church, and even described the F\u00fchrer himself as a 'mad prophet possessed of repulsive arrogance'.

According to rumours, he asked for another ballot to be taken to ensure the validity of his election. After his election was indeed confirmed, he chose the name Pius XII in honour of his immediate predecessor.\n\nHis [[Papal Coronation|coronation]] took place on 12 March 1939. Upon being elected pope he was also formally the Grand Master of the Equestrian [[Order of the Holy Sepulchre]] of Jerusalem, [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith|prefect of the Supreme Sacred Congregation of the Holy Office]], [[Congregation for the Oriental Churches|prefect of the Sacred Congregation for the Oriental Churches]] and [[Congregation for Bishops|prefect of the Sacred Consistorial Congregation]].

Cardinal Maglione, a seasoned Vatican diplomat, had reestablished diplomatic relations with Switzerland and was for many years nuncio in Paris. Yet, Maglione did not exercise the influence of his predecessor Pacelli, who as Pope continued his close relation with Monsignors Montini (later [[Pope Paul VI]]) and [[Domenico Tardini]]. After the death of Maglione in 1944, Pius left the position open and named Tardini head of its foreign section and Montini head of the internal section.<ref>Congregation of Extraordinary Ecclesiastical Affairs and Congregation of Ordinary Affairs</ref> Tardini and Montini continued serving there until 1953, when Pius XII decided to appoint them cardinals,<ref>Pio XII, ''La Allocuzione nel consistorio Segreto del 12 Gennaio 1953'' in Pio XII, Discorsi e Radiomessagi di Sua Santita Vatican City, 1953, p. 455</ref> an honor which both turned down.<ref>Domenico Cardinale Tardini, Pio XII, Tipografia Poliglotta Vaticana, 1960, p. 157</ref> They were then later appointed to be Pro-Secretary with the privilege to wear Episcopal Insignia.<ref>Giulio Nicolini, Il Cardinale Domenico Tardini, Padova, 1980; {{ISBN|88-7026-340-1}}; p. 313</ref> Tardini continued to be a close co-worker of the Pope until the death of Pius XII, while Montini became archbishop of [[Milan]], after the death of [[Alfredo Ildefonso Schuster]].\n\nPius XII slowly eroded the Italian monopoly on the [[Roman Curia]]; he employed German and [[Dutch people|Dutch]] [[Jesuit]] advisors, Robert Leiber, [[Augustin Bea]], and [[Sebastian Tromp]]. He also supported the elevation of Americans such as Cardinal [[Francis Spellman]] from a minor to a major role in the Church.<ref>In the Secretariat of State he had actively supported \"foreigners\", for example Francis Spellman, the American monsignor, whom he consecrated himself as the first American Bishop in the Vatican curia.

Pius XII chose not to name new cardinals during World War II, and the number of cardinals shrank to 38, with [[Dennis Joseph Dougherty]] of [[Philadelphia]] being the only living U.S. cardinal. The first occasion on 18 February 1946\u2014which has become known as the \"Grand Consistory\"\u2014yielded the elevation of a record 32 new cardinals, almost 50 percent of the College of Cardinals and reaching the canonical limit of 70 cardinals.<ref>(previously [[Pope Leo X|Leo X]]'s elevation of 31 cardinals in 1517 had held this title). [[Pope John Paul II|John Paul II]] surpassed this number on 21 February 2001, elevating 44 cardinals. By that time, the limit had been suspended and over 120 Cardinals existed.</ref> In the 1946 consistory, Pius XII, while maintaining the maximum size of the College of Cardinals at 70, named cardinals from [[China]], [[India]], the [[Middle East]] and increased the number of Cardinals from the Americas, proportionally lessening the Italian influence.<ref>Oscar Halecki, James Murray, Jr. ''Pius XII, Eugenio Pacelli, Pope of Peace'', p. 371</ref>\n\nIn his second consistory on 12 January 1953, it was expected that his closest co-workers, Msgrs. [[Domenico Tardini]] and Giovanni Montini would be elevated<ref>Levillain, 2002, p. 1136</ref> and Pius XII informed the assembled cardinals that both of them were originally on the top of his list,<ref>Pio XII, La Allocuzione nel concistorio Segreto del 12 Gennaio 1953 in Pio XII, Discorsi e Radiomessaggi di Sua Santit\u00e0, Vatican City, 1953, p. 455</ref> but they had turned down the offer, and were rewarded instead with other promotions.<ref>Tardini later thanked him for not appointing him.

I replied \"Yes Holy Father, I thank you for everything you have done for me, but even more, what you have not done for me\". The Pope smiled. In Domenico Cardinale Tardini, Pio XII, Tipografia Poliglotta Vaticana, 1960 157</ref> Both Montini and Tardini would become Cardinals shortly after Pius' death; Montini later became [[Pope Paul VI]].

In its new constitutions, Eastern Patriarchs were made almost independent from Rome (CIC Orientalis, 1957) Eastern marriage law (CIC Orientalis, 1949), civil law (CIC Orientalis, 1950), laws governing religious associations (CIC Orientalis, 1952) property law (CIC Orientalis, 1952) and other laws. These reforms and writings of Pius XII were intended to establish Eastern Orientals as equal parts of the mystical body of Christ, as explained in the [[encyclical]] ''[[Mystici corporis]]''.\n\n===Priests and religious===\nWith the [[Apostolic constitution]] ''Sedis Sapientiae'', Pius XII added [[social sciences]], [[sociology]], [[psychology]] and [[social psychology]], to the pastoral training of future priests. Pius XII emphasised the need to systematically analyze the [[psychological]] condition of candidates to the [[priesthood]] to ensure that they are capable of a life of celibacy and service.<ref>AAS, 1956, p. 354 ff</ref> Pius XII added one year to the theological formation of future priests.

[[Mediator Dei]] clarified membership and participation in the Church. The encyclical ''[[Divino afflante Spiritu]]'' opened the doors for biblical research. His magisterium was far larger and is difficult to summarize. In numerous speeches Catholic teaching is related to various aspects of life, education, medicine, politics, war and peace, the life of saints, [[Veneration of Mary in the Catholic Church|Mary]], the [[Mother of God]], things eternal and contemporary. Theologically, Pius XII specified the nature of the teaching authority of the Church. He also gave a new freedom to engage in theological investigations.<ref>''[[Humani generis]]'' (1950) and ''[[Divino afflante Spiritu]]'' (1943), p. 305</ref>\n\n===Theological orientation===\n====Biblical research====\n{{Main article|Divino afflante Spiritu}}\nThe encyclical ''Divino afflante Spiritu'', published in 1943,<ref>AAS, 1943, p. 297</ref> emphasized the role of the Bible. Pius XII freed biblical research from previous limitations. He encouraged Christian theologians to revisit original versions of the Bible in [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Hebrew]]. Noting improvements in [[archaeology]], the encyclical reversed Pope Leo XIII's encyclical, which had only advocated going back to the original texts to resolve ambiguity in the [[Latin Vulgate]]. The encyclical demands a much better understanding of ancient Hebrew history and traditions. It requires bishops throughout the Church to initiate [[biblical studies]] for lay people. The Pontiff also requests a reorientation of Catholic teaching and education, relying much more on sacred scriptures in [[sermon]]s and religious instruction.<ref>AAS, 1943, p. 305</ref>\n\n====The role of theology====\nThis theological investigative freedom does not, however, extend to all aspects of theology. According to Pius, theologians, employed by the Church, are assistants, to teach the official teachings of the Church and not their own private thoughts. They are free to engage in empirical research, which the Church generously supports, but in matters of [[morality]] and religion, they are subjected to the teaching office and authority of the Church, the [[Magisterium]]. \"The most noble office of theology is to show how a doctrine defined by the Church is contained in the sources of revelation, ... in that sense in which it has been defined by the Church.\"<ref>Pius XII, Enc.

The pontificate of Pius XII was the first in Vatican history that published papal speeches and addresses in [[vernacular]] language on a systematic basis. Until then, papal documents were issued mainly in [[Latin]] in ''[[Acta Apostolicae Sedis]]'' since 1909. Because of the novelty of it all, and a feared [[military occupation|occupation]] of the Vatican by the German [[Wehrmacht]], not all documents exist today. In 1944, a number of papal documents were burned or \"walled in\",<ref>Communication, Father Robert Graham, SJ, 10 November 1992</ref> to avoid detection by the advancing German army.

''[[Orientalis Ecclesiae]]'' was issued in 1944 on the 15th centenary of the death of [[Cyril of Alexandria]], a saint common to [[Eastern Christianity]] and [[Latin]] Churches. Pius XII asks for prayer for better understanding and unification of the Churches. ''[[Orientales omnes Ecclesias]]'', issued in 1945 on the 350th anniversary of the reunion, is a call to continued unity of the [[Ruthenian Greek Catholic Church]], threatened in its very existence by the authorities of the Soviet Union. ''[[Sempiternus Rex]]'' was issued in 1951 on the 1500th anniversary of the Ecumenical [[Council of Chalcedon]]. It included a call to oriental communities adhering to [[Miaphysite]] theology to return to the Catholic Church. ''Orientales Ecclesias'' was issued in 1952 and addressed to the Eastern Churches, protesting the continued [[Stalinist]] persecution of the Church. Several [[Apostolic Letter]]s were sent to the bishops in the East. On 13 May 1956, Pope Pius addressed all bishops of the Eastern Rite. Mary, the mother of God, was the subject of encyclical letters to the people of Russia in ''[[Fulgens corona]]'', as well as a papal letter to the people of Russia.<ref>''Orientalis Ecclesiae'', AAS, 1944, p. 129</ref><ref>''Orientales omnes Ecclesias'', AAS, 1946, pp. 33\u201363.</ref><ref>''Sempiternus Rex'', AAS, 1951, pp. 625\u201344.</ref><ref>''Orientales Ecclesias''.

In April 1940, the Vatican advised the US government that its efforts to provide humanitarian aid had been blocked by the Germans and that the Holy See had been forced to seek indirect channels through which to direct its aid.<ref>[http://docs.fdrlibrary.marist.edu/psf/box51/a464o10.html Franklin D.

The Church's attempted intervention caused the Nazis to retaliate by arresting rabbis and deporting them to the death camp. Subsequently, the Catholic Church in Poland abandoned direct intervention, instead focusing on organizing underground aid, with huge international support orchestrated by Pope Pius XII and his Holy See. The Pope was informed about [[War crimes in occupied Poland during World War II|Nazi atrocities committed in Poland]] by both officials of the Polish Church and the [[Polish Underground]].

His encyclicals, ''[[Evangelii praecones]]'' and ''[[Fidei donum]]'', issued on 2 June 1951 and 21 April 1957, respectively, increased the local decision-making of Catholic missions, many of which became independent dioceses. Pius XII demanded recognition of local cultures as fully equal to European culture.<ref>Audience for the directors of mission activities in 1944 A.A.S., 1944, p. 208</ref><ref>''[[Evangelii praecones]]''. p. 56</ref> Though his language retained old conceptions&nbsp;\u2013 Africa, for example, merited special attention since the church there worked 'to forward her work among the heathen multitudes' \u2013 in 1956 he expressed solidarity with the 'non-Europeans who aspire to full political independence'. <ref>Robert Ventresca, Soldier of Christ, p.282-283</ref> Continuing the line of his predecessors, Pius XII supported the establishment of local administration in Church affairs: in 1950, the hierarchy of Western Africa became independent; in 1951, Southern Africa; and in 1953, [[British East Africa]]. Finland, [[Burma]] and [[French Africa]] became independent dioceses in 1955.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the war, Pius XII [[Cardinals created by Pope Pius XII in 1946|elevated a number]] of high-profile resistors of Nazism to the College of Cardinals in 1946, among them the German Bishops [[Joseph Frings]] of Cologne, [[Clemens August Graf von Galen|Clemens von Galen]] of M\u00fcnster and [[Konrad von Preysing]] of Berlin. From elsewhere in the liberated [[Greater Germanic Reich|Nazi Empire]] Pius selected other resistors: Dutch Archbishop [[Johannes de Jong]]; Hungarian Bishop [[J\u00f3zsef Mindszenty]]; Polish Archbishop [[Adam Stefan Sapieha]]; and French Archbishop [[Jules-G\u00e9raud Sali\u00e8ge]]. In 1946 and 1953, respectively, he named as cardinals [[Thomas Tien Ken-sin|Thomas Tien]] of China and [[Valerian Gracias]] of India&nbsp;\u2013 the first indigenous Catholics of their respective nations to sit in the [[College of Cardinals]].<ref>Ventresca, p.284</ref> Italian Papal diplomat [[Angelo Roncalli]] (later Pope John XXIII) and Polish Archbishop [[Stefan Wyszy\u0144ski]] were others among those [[Cardinals created by Pope Pius XII in 1953|elevated in 1953]].\n\nA German contingent dominated his inner circle at this period&nbsp;\u2013 the German Jesuits [[Robert Leiber]], Wilhelm Hentrich and Ivo Zeiger. His personal confessor Augustin Bea was a German Jesuit and Mother Pascalina Lehnert and the other German speaking sisters of the papal household added to this element. The American bishop [[Aloisius Muench]] wrote in November 1948 that Pius XII was 'more interested in affairs of the Church in Germany than in any other part of the Church' and resolved to make the postwar German crisis a top priority \u2013 'its refugee crisis, poverty, hunger and disease, the fate of prisoners-of-war and accused war criminals, the disruption to the internal organization and communal life of German Catholicism, and Germany's uncertain political future'.<ref>Robert Ventresca, Soldier of Christ, p.240</ref>\n\nHe was concerned too about the potential spread of Communism in Western Europe and the Americas. As he sought to secure resources from abroad to aid post-war recovery, believing deprivation fuelled political agitation, so he also sought to influence Italian politics. In January 1948, Luigi Gedda, of Italy's [[Catholic Action]] movement, was called to the Vatican as the campaign for the first parliament of Italy's post-fascist republic was underway.<ref>Robert Ventresca, Soldier of Christ, p.242</ref> The Communists and Socialists seemed headed for victory and Pius XII wanted Catholic Action, an organization of Catholic laity, to mobilise the Catholic vote against parties of the Left. In July 1949 he approved a controversial move by the Holy Office to threaten with [[excommunication]] anyone with known Communist affiliations. A group of Jesuits around the journal ''[[La Civilta Cattolica]]'', active in Vatican circles, further spread alarm that ''fifth columns'' of Soviet Communism were active in Western Europe poised to exploit popular discontent to aid Soviet expansionism. He was responsible for giving the appellative title, The Catholic University of the Philippines to the then [[Pontifical]] and Royal [[University of Santo Tomas]].\n\nPius XII was rather distrustful of [[Alcide de Gasperi]] and [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Italy's Christian Democrats]], considering the party indecisive and fractious&nbsp;\u2013 reformist currents within it particularly, which tended to the moderate Left&nbsp;\u2013 represented by the Sicilian priest [[Luigi Sturzo]] for example&nbsp;\u2013 he considered too accommodating to the Left. On the eve of the 1952 local elections in Rome, in which again the Communist and Socialist parties threatened to win out, he used informal connections to make his views known. Pius XII stated that the war against communism was a holy war and excommunicated members of the Communist Party. Having decided to encourage the Christian Democrats to consider a political alliance with the Rightist parties as part of an anti-left coalition, he asked the Jesuit, Father Riccardo Lombardi, to speak with de Gasperi to consider such an alliance&nbsp;\u2013 an electoral alliance with those even of monarchist and neo-fascist tendencies -including the [[Italian Social Movement]]. Adopting a domino theory he warned that, if \"the Communists win in Rome, in Italy, it will cast a shadow on the entire world: France would become Communist, and then Spain and then all of Europe'.<ref>Robert Ventresca, Soldier of Christ, p.246</ref> de Gasperi rejected the idea as politically dangerous to the long term fortunes of a centrist Catholic party.\n\n==Later life, illness and death==\n===Late years of Pope Pius XII===\n{{Main article|Late years of Pope Pius XII}}\nThe last years of the [[pontificate]] of Pius XII began in late 1954 with a long illness, during which he considered [[abdication]]. Afterwards, changes in his work habit became noticeable. The Pope avoided long ceremonies, canonizations and consistories and displayed hesitancy in personnel matters. He found it increasingly difficult to chastise subordinates and appointees such as his physician, [[Riccardo Galeazzi-Lisi]], who after numerous indiscretions was excluded from Papal service for the last years, but, keeping his title, was able to enter the papal apartments to make photos of the dying Pope, which he sold to French magazines.<ref>Schneider, p. 80</ref> Pius underwent three courses of [[Rejuvenation (aging)|cellular rejuvenation]] treatment administered by [[Paul Niehans]], the most important in 1954 when Pacelli was gravely ill. Side-effects of the treatment included hallucinations, from which the Pope suffered in his last years. \"These years were also plagued by horrific nightmares. Pacelli's blood-curdling screams could be heard throughout the papal apartments.\"<ref>Gerard Noel, ''Pius XII, The Hound of Hitler'', p. 3</ref>\n\nPius XII often elevated young priests as bishops, such as [[Julius D\u00f6pfner]] (35 years) and Karol Wojtyla (later [[Pope John Paul II]], 38 years), one of his last appointees in 1958. He took a firm stand against pastoral experiments, such as \"[[worker-priest]]s\", who worked full-time in factories and joined political parties and unions. He continued to defend the theological tradition of [[Thomism]] as worthy of continued reform, and as superior to modern trends such as [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] or [[existentialism]].<ref>See ''[[Humani generis]]''.</ref>\n\n===Illness and death===\n[[File:Tumulo pio xii.jpg|thumb|''The Pope of Mary'': A [[Madonna and Child]], added by John Paul II in 1982, hangs over the tomb of Pius XII.]]\nWith frequent absences from work, Pope Pius XII had come to depend heavily on a few close colleagues, especially his aide [[Domenico Tardini]], his speechwriter [[Robert Leiber]], and his long-serving housekeeper [[Pascalina Lehnert]]. The Pope still addressed lay people and groups about a wide range of topics. Sometimes he answered specific moral questions, which were addressed to him. To professional associations he explained specific occupational ethics in light of Church teachings. Robert Leiber helped him occasionally with his speeches and publications. [[Augustin Bea|Cardinal Augustine Bea SJ]] was his personal confessor. [[Pascalina Lehnert|Sister Pasqualina]] was for forty years his \"housekeeper, muse and lifelong companion\".<ref>Noel, p. 4</ref>\n\nOn 5 October 1958, at his summer residence [[Castel Gandolfo]], the Pope suffered painful complications, but tried to continue his duties between intervals of rest. Next morning, the doctors came to pump his stomach, apparently with success, but he lost consciousness and was given the last rites. Presently he awoke, and the nuns opened the door to the Papal Chapel so he could see and hear them praying the rosary. The next day, he appeared to improve and received visitors. When they opened the window in the evening, he looked out at the stars and said quietly \"Look, how beautiful, how great is our Lord\u201d. On the last full day of his life, his temperature rose steadily and his breathing became difficult. At 3.52 a.m. on 9 October, he gave a smile, lowered his head and died. The cause of death was recorded as acute [[heart failure]]. Monsignor Domenico Tardini prayed the ''Magnificat Anima mea dominum'', the Virgin Mary's praise of the Lord, in Latin. His doctor Gaspanini said afterwards: \"The Holy Father did not die because of any specific illness. He was completely exhausted. He was overworked beyond limit. His heart was healthy, his lungs were good. He could have lived another 20 years, had he spared himself.\"<ref>Lehnert, Pascalina, p. 191</ref>\n\n===Botched embalming===\nPius XII's physician, [[Riccardo Galeazzi-Lisi]], reported that the pontiff's body was embalmed in the room where he died using a novel process invented by Oreste Nuzzi.<ref name=ModernMummies>{{cite book|title=Modern Mummies|first=Christine|last=Quigley|year=1998|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ZOqU-9BTZO4C&pg=PA204 |publisher=McFarland & Co.|isbn=978-0-7864-0492-6}}</ref>\n\nPope Pius XII did not want the vital organs removed from his body, demanding instead that it be kept in the same condition \"in which God created it\".<ref name=\"AP 11Oct58\"/> According to Galeazzi-Lisi, this was the reason why he and Nuzzi, an embalmer from [[Naples]], used an atypical approach with the embalming procedure.<ref name=\"AP 11Oct58\"/> In a controversial press conference, Galeazzi-Lisi described in great detail the embalming of the body of the late pontiff.

As a result, the body decomposed rapidly and the viewing of the faithful had to be terminated abruptly.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nGaleazzi-Lisi reported that heat in the halls, where the body of the late Pope lay in state, caused chemical reactions which required it to be treated twice after the original preparation.<ref name=\"AP 11Oct58\"/> Swiss Guards stationed around Pius XII's body were reported to have become ill during their vigil.<ref name=ModernMummies/>\n\n===Funeral===\nHis funeral procession into Rome was the largest congregation of Romans as of that date. Romans mourned \"their\" pope, who was born in their own city, especially as a hero in the time of war.<ref>Lehnert, Pascalina. ''Ich durfte ihm dienen'', p. 197</ref> Cardinal Angelo Giuseppe Roncalli (later to be [[Pope John XXIII]]) wrote in his diary on 11 October 1958 that probably no Roman emperor had enjoyed such a triumph, which he viewed as a reflection of the spiritual majesty and religious dignity of the late Pius XII.<ref>[[Peter Hebblethwaite|Hebblethwaite, Peter]]. ''John XXIII, Pope of the Council'' (revised edition), Harper Collins: Glasgow. 1994</ref>\n\nThe late pope lay in state on a bier surrounded by four Swiss Guards, and was then placed in the coffin for burial. Pius XII was buried in the grottos beneath St. Peter's Basilica in a simple tomb in a small chapel.\n\n==Cause for canonisation==\n{{Main article|Canonization of Pope Pius XII}}\nThe [[Testament of Pope Pius XII]] was published immediately after his death. Pope Pius XII's [[Congregation for the Causes of Saints|cause of canonization]] was opened on 18 November 1965 by Pope Paul VI during the final session of the [[Second Vatican Council]]. In May 2007, the congregation recommended that Pius XII should be declared [[Venerable]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/0702592.htm|archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20070612181832/http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/0702592.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=12 June 2007|title=CNS STORY: Sainthood congregation recommends Pope Pius XII be named venerable|publisher=Catholicnews.com|accessdate=6 May 2009}}</ref> [[Pope Benedict XVI]] did so on 19 December 2009, simultaneously making the same declaration in regard to Pope John Paul II.<ref name=\"Pitel\"/>\n\nFor Venerable status The Congregation for the Causes of Saints certifies the \"heroic virtues\" of the candidate. Making Pius XII Venerable met with various responses, most centred on the papal words and actions during World War II. Benedict's signature on the Decree of Heroic Virtue was regarded by some as a public relations blunder, though acceptance of Pius XII as a saviour of Europe's Jews is regarded as 'proof of fidelity to the Church, the ''pope'' and the Tradition' by neoconservative Catholic groups.<ref>Paul O'Shea, A Cross too Heavy, Palgrave Macmillan, 2011, p. 2</ref> On the other hand, Rabbi [[Marvin Hier]], founder and dean at the [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]] said, \"...there would be a great distortion of history\" if Pius XII were canonized.<ref name=\"afp\">AFP. 22 December 2009. \"[https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hkzlifIdlOmb9wKRtm48d4OADI4g Wiesenthal Center shocked at pope Pius sainthood moves] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111122135058/https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hkzlifIdlOmb9wKRtm48d4OADI4g |date=22 November 2011 }}\".</ref> Rabbi Jeremy Lawrence, the head of [[Great Synagogue (Sydney)|Sydney's Great Synagogue]], said: \"How can one venerate a man who ... seemed to give his passive permission to the Nazis as the Jews were prised from his doorstep in Rome?\"<ref name=\"maley\">Jacqueline Maley. 24 December 2009. \"[http://www.smh.com.au/national/rabbi-hits-out-at-popes-veneration-of-pius-xii-20091222-lbsy.html Rabbi hits out at Pope's Veneration of Pius XII]\".

From this we learn that, although Pius's defenders still say that he paid a golden ransom in a vain effort to save Rome's Jews from transportation to the death camps, the most he did was indicate a willingness to chip in if the Jews could not raise the sum demanded. He also shows that no individual Jews were spared, as is often claimed, after Pius personally intervened with the Nazis. Moreover, Katz reveals that those who did escape the Nazi round-up and found sanctuary in church buildings in Rome did so in the face of explicit opposition from the Vatican. The real heroes and heroines were the priests and nuns who refused to bow to Pius's officials and hand over the desperate people whom they were hiding. The main problem with writing about Pius's wartime is that in effect, he did nothing. Facing the murders of six million people, he remained silent. As Jews were taken away from the ghetto that sat right alongside St Peter's, he may have agonised, but he did not intervene. When he did raise his voice with the German occupiers, it was either to ensure that the Vatican City state would not be compromised\u2014that is to say, he would be safe\u2014or to emphasise his own neutrality in a conflict which, for many, became a battle between good and evil. His unrealistic hope was that the Catholic Church could emerge as the peacemaker across Europe. Instead, both the American and British leaderships, as Katz shows, regarded the papacy as tainted by its association with Nazism and irrelevant in the post-1945 reshaping of the continent. Both had urged Pius to speak up against the Holocaust and so drew their own conclusions about him.

Go\u00f1i found out that the British Envoy [[D'Arcy Osborne, 12th Duke of Leeds|D'Arcy Osborne]] had intervened with Pope Pius XII to put an end to these illegal activities. Furthermore, he discovered \"that the Pope secretly pleaded with Washington and London on behalf of notorious criminals and Nazi collaborators\".<ref>Go\u00f1i, afterword to the revised 2003 edition, pp. 327\u2013348.</ref> Suzanne Brown-Fleming's ''The Holocaust and Catholic Conscience. Cardinal Aloisius Muench and the Guilt Question in Germany'' (2006) underlines Go\u00f1i's findings. In her remarkable study, Brown-Fleming clearly demonstrated how Pius XII intervened on behalf of rather vicious German war criminals (e.g. [[Otto Ohlendorf]]). Brown-Fleming's main source was the archive of Pope Pius XII's representative in post-war Germany, [[Aloisius Joseph Muench|Cardinal Aloisius Muench]].<ref>Brown-Fleming, 2006, Chapter 4: ''Granting Absolution. Muench and the Catholic Clemency Campaign''.</ref> Then, Phayer's ''[[Pius XII, The Holocaust, and the Cold War]]'' (2008) makes use of many documents that have recently come to light thanks to [[Bill Clinton]]'s 1997 executive order declassifying wartime and postwar documents, many of which are currently at the [[US National Archives]] and [[Holocaust Memorial Museum]]. These documents include diplomatic correspondence, American espionage, and even decryptions of German communications. Relevant documents have also been released by the [[Argentine government]] and the British Foreign Office and other information sources have become available, including the diary of Bishop [[Joseph Patrick Hurley|Hurley]]. These documents reveal new information about Pius XII's actions regarding the [[Usta\u0161e]] regime, the genocides in Poland, the finances of the wartime church, the deportation of the Roman Jews, and the ratlines for Nazis and fascists fleeing Europe.<ref>Phayer, 2008, pp. xi\u2013xvi</ref> According to Phayer, \"the face of Pope Pius that we see in these documents is not the same face we see in the eleven volumes the Vatican published of World War II documents, a collection which, though valuable, is nonetheless critically flawed because of its many omissions\".<ref>Phayer, 2008, p. xi</ref>\n\nOn 19 September 2008, Pope [[Benedict XVI]] held a reception for conference participants during which he praised Pius XII as a pope who made every effort to save Jews during the war.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/speeches/2008/september/documents/hf_ben-xvi_spe_20080918_pave-the-way_en.html|title=Address at the conclusion of the symposium organized by the \"Pave the Way Foundation\"|publisher=Vatican.va|date=19 September 2008|accessdate=6 May 2009}}</ref> A second conference was held from 6\u20138 November 2008 by the Pontifical Academy of Life.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/new.php?n=12968|title=Vatican recalls life and teachings of Pius XII 50 years after his death|publisher=Catholicnewsagency.com|accessdate=6 May 2009}}</ref>\n\nOn 9 October 2008, the 50th anniversary of Pius XII's death, Benedict XVI celebrated pontifical Mass in his memory. Shortly before and after the Mass, dialectics continued between the Jewish hierarchy and the Vatican as Rabbi Shear Yeshuv Cohen of [[Haifa]] addressed the Synod of Bishops and expressed his disappointment towards Pius XII's \"silence\" during the war.<ref>{{cite news|last=Donadio|first=Rachel|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/10/world/europe/10briefs-POPEDEFENDSP_BRF.html?ref=world|title=Synod Controversy|location=Italy|publisher=Nytimes.com|date=9 October 2008|accessdate=17 December 2011}}</ref>\n\nOn 16 June 2009, the Pave the Way Foundation announced that it would release of 2,300 pages of documents in [[Avellino, Italy]], dating from 1940 to 1945, which the organisation claims show that Pius XII \"worked diligently to save Jews from Nazi tyranny\"; the organisation's founder, Krupp has accused historians of harbouring \"private agendas\" and having \"let down\" the public.<ref>''Jerusalem Post''. 2009, 17 June\n[https://web.archive.org/web/20110624130904/http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1245184852508&pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull \"Foundation says documents will show Pius helped Jews\"].</ref> The foundation's research led to the publication of the book ''Pope Pius XII and World War II: the documented truth'', authored by Krupp; the book reproduces 225 pages of the new documents produced by the foundation's research.\n\n[[Mark Riebling]] argued in his 2015 book ''Church of Spies'' that Pius XII was involved in plots to overthrow Hitler since mid-October 1939 and was prepared to mediate a peace between the Allies and the Axis in the event of a regime change in Germany. The courier between the resistance group under [[Wilhelm Canaris|Admiral Canaris]] and the Pope was the Bavarian lawyer and Catholic politician [[Josef M\u00fcller (CSU politician)|Joseph M\u00fcller]].<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UpxVDgAAQBAJ&pg=PT47 |page=47\u201349; 62\u201364 |publisher=[[Basic Books]] |title=Church of Spies: The Pope's Secret War Against Hitler |isbn=9780465061556 |date=29 September 2015 }}</ref>\n\n====Opening of the Vatican Secret Archives====\nOn the occasion of the 80th anniversary of the election of Pius XII as Bishop of Rome, Pope Francis announced during an audience for staff of the Vatican Secret Archives on 4 March 2019 that Vatican archival materials pertaining to Pius\u2019 pontificate will be accessible to scholars beginning on 2 March 2020.<ref>[https://www.vaticannews.va/en/pope/news/2019-03/pope-francis-vatican-secret-archives-pius-xii.html ''Pope Francis: Pius XII archives to open next year''], Vatican News, 4 March 2019.</ref> <ref> The Guardian [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/04/vatican-to-open-archives-on-controversial-wwii-pope-pius-xii]</ref> While this announcement was welcome by researchers, much of it has been clouded by the role of Pope Pius XII with regard to the Holocaust. However, archival research of this period should inform a much broader shift within global Christianity, from Europe to the global South.<ref>[https://www.historiadomus.net/2019/03/10/the-shift-in-the-vatican-secret-archives''The Shift in the Vatican Secret Archives''], Historia Domus, 10 March 2019.</ref>\n\nMore than 150 people have applied to access the archives, although only 60 can be accommodated in the offices at one time. Among the first to view the documents will be representatives of the Jewish community in Rome, and scholars from Yad Vashem, Israel\u2019s Holocaust museum, and the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.\n\nDavid Kertzer, an American expert on the relationship between the Catholic church and fascism, who will begin examining the papers this week, said there were \u201csigns of nervousness\u201d at the Vatican about what would emerge from the archives.

His parents were Filippo Pacelli (1837\u20131916) and Virginia (n\u00e9e Graziosi) Pacelli (1844\u20131920). His grandfather, Marcantonio Pacelli, had been Under-Secretary in the Papal Ministry of Finances<ref>Pollard, 2005, p. 70</ref> and then Secretary of the Interior under [[Pope Pius IX]] from 1851 to 1870 and helped found the Vatican's newspaper, ''[[L'Osservatore Romano]]'' in 1861.<ref>Marchione, 2004, p. 1</ref><ref>Gerard Noel, Pius XII:The Hound of Hitler, p. 5</ref> His cousin, [[Ernesto Pacelli]], was a key financial advisor to [[Pope Leo XIII]]; his father, Filippo Pacelli, a [[Franciscan]] [[Third order|tertiary]],<ref>O'Brien, p. 1</ref> was the dean of the [[Roman Rota]]; and his brother, [[Francesco Pacelli]], became a [[Laity|lay]] [[canon law]]yer and the legal advisor to [[Pope Pius XI]], in which role he negotiated the [[Lateran Treaty]] in 1929 with [[Benito Mussolini]], bringing an end to the [[Roman Question]].\n\nTogether with his brother Francesco and his two sisters, Giuseppina and Elisabetta, he grew up in the [[Parione]] district in the centre of Rome. Soon after the family had moved to Via Vetrina in 1880 he began school at the convent of the French [[Sisters of Divine Providence]] in the Piazza Fiammetta. The family worshipped at [[Santa Maria in Vallicella|Chiesa Nuova]]. Eugenio and the other children made their [[First Communion]] at this church and Eugenio served there as an [[altar boy]] from 1886. In 1886 too he was sent to the private school of Professor Giuseppe Marchi, close to the [[Piazza Venezia]].<ref>Paul O'Shea, A Cross Too Heavy, 2011, p. 79</ref> In 1891 Pacelli's father sent Eugenio to the Liceo Ennio Quirino Visconti Institute, a state school situated in what had been the [[Collegio Romano]], the premier Jesuit university in Rome.\n\nIn 1894, aged 18, Pacelli began his theology studies at Rome's oldest seminary, the [[Almo Collegio Capranica]],<ref>O'Shea, p. 81</ref> and in November of the same year, registered to take a philosophy course at the Jesuit [[Pontifical Gregorian University]] and theology at the [[Pontifical Roman Athenaeum S. Apollinare]]. He was also enrolled at the [[University of Rome La Sapienza|State University, La Sapienza]] where he studied modern languages and history. At the end of the first academic year however, in the summer of 1895, he dropped out of both the Capranica and the Gregorian University. According to his sister Elisabetta, the food at the Capranica was to blame.<ref>Cornwell, p. 22</ref> Having received a special dispensation he continued his studies from home and so spent most of his seminary years as an external student. In 1899 he completed his education in Sacred Theology with a doctoral degree awarded on the basis of a short dissertation and an oral examination in [[Latin]].<ref>Cornwell, p. 23</ref>\n\n==Church career==\n\n===Priest and Monsignor===\n[[File:Pacelliordenado.jpg|thumb|upright|150px|Pacelli on the day of his ordination: 2 April 1899]]\nWhile all other candidates from the Rome diocese were ordained in the [[Basilica of St. John Lateran]],<ref name=\"Gerard Noel, p.9\">Noel, p. 9</ref> Pacelli was [[Holy Orders|ordained]] a priest on [[Easter Sunday]], 2 April 1899 alone in the private chapel of a family friend the [[Vicegerent]] of Rome, [[Francesco di Paola Cassetta|Mgr Paolo Cassetta]]. Shortly after ordination he began postgraduate studies in canon law at Sant'Apollinaire. He received his first assignment as a [[curate]] at [[Santa Maria in Vallicella|Chiesa Nuova]].<ref name=\"marchione193\">Marchione, 2000, p. 193</ref> In 1901 he entered the [[Section for Relations with States (Roman Curia)|Congregation for Extraordinary Ecclesiastical Affairs]], a sub-office of the [[Secretariat of State (Vatican)|Vatican Secretariat of State]].<ref>O'Shea, p. 82</ref>\n\nMonsignor [[Pietro Gasparri]], the recently appointed undersecretary at the Department of Extraordinary Affairs, had underscored his proposal to Pacelli to work in the \"Vatican's equivalent of the Foreign office\" by highlighting the \"necessity of defending the Church from the onslaughts of secularism and liberalism throughout Europe\".<ref name=\"Gerard Noel, p. 10\">Noel, p. 10</ref> Pacelli became an ''apprendista'', an apprentice, in Gasparri's department.

The theme of his thesis was the nature of [[concordats]] and the function of canon law when a concordat falls into abeyance. Promoted to the position of ''minutante'', he prepared digests of reports that had been sent to the Secretariat from all over the world and in the same year became a [[papal chamberlain]]. In 1905 he received the title [[Domestic Prelate|domestic prelate]].<ref name=\"marchione193\"/> From 1904 until 1916, he assisted Cardinal Pietro Gasparri in his codification of [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]] with the Department of Extraordinary Ecclesiastical Affairs.<ref name=\"marchione10\">Marchione, 2004, p. 10</ref> According to [[John Cornwell (writer)|John Cornwell]] \"the text, together with the [[Anti-Modernist Oath]], became the means by which the Holy See was to establish and sustain the new, unequal, and unprecedented power relationship that had arisen between the papacy and the Church\".<ref>Cornwell, ''Hitler's Pope'', p. 42</ref>\n\nIn 1908, Pacelli served as a Vatican representative on the [[International Eucharistic Congress]], accompanying [[Rafael Merry del Val]]<ref>Cornwell, p. 32</ref> to London,<ref name=\"marchione9\"/> where he met [[Winston Churchill]].<ref>Dalin, 2005, p. 47</ref> In 1911, he represented the Holy See at the [[Coronation of the British monarch|coronation]] of King [[George V]].<ref name=\"marchione10\"/>\nPacelli became the under-secretary in 1911, adjunct-secretary in 1912 (a position he received under [[Pope Pius X]] and retained under [[Pope Benedict XV]]), and secretary of the Department of Extraordinary Ecclesiastical Affairs in February 1914.<ref name=\"marchione10\"/> On 24 June 1914, just four days before [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria]] was assassinated in [[Sarajevo]], Pacelli, together with [[Cardinal Merry del Val]], represented the Vatican when the Serbian Concordat was signed. [[Serbia]]'s success in the [[First Balkan War]] against [[Turkey]] in 1912 had increased the number of Catholics within greater Serbia. At this time Serbia, encouraged by Russia, was challenging [[Austria-Hungary]]'s sphere of influence throughout the [[Balkans]]. Pius X died on 20 August 1914. His successor Benedict XV named Gasparri as secretary of state and Gasparri took Pacelli with him into the Secretariat of State, making him undersecretary.<ref>O'Shea, pp. 86, 88</ref> During World War I, Pacelli maintained the Vatican's registry of [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] and worked to implement papal relief initiatives. In 1915, he travelled to [[Vienna]] to assist Monsignor [[Raffaele Scapinelli di L\u00e9guigno|Raffaele Scapinelli]], [[nuncio]] to Vienna, in his negotiations with Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria]] regarding Italy.<ref>Levillain, 2002, p. 1211</ref>\n\n===Archbishop and Papal nuncio===\n{{Main article|Nunciature of Eugenio Pacelli}}\n[[File:PioXIIgernamia1917.jpg|thumb|right|170px|Pacelli at the Headquarters of [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]]]]\nPope Benedict XV appointed Pacelli as [[Apostolic Nuncio to Bavaria|nuncio to Bavaria]] on 23 April 1917, consecrating him as [[titular bishop|titular]] [[See of Sardis|Archbishop of Sardis]] in the [[Sistine Chapel]] on 13 May 1917. After his consecration, Eugenio Pacelli left for [[Bavaria]]. As there was no nuncio to [[Prussia]] or Germany at the time, Pacelli was, for all practical purposes, the nuncio to all of the [[German Empire]].\n\nOnce in [[Munich]], he conveyed the papal initiative to end the war to German authorities.<ref>Fatoni, 1992, pp. 45\u201385</ref> He met with [[Ludwig III of Bavaria|King Ludwig III]] on 29 May, and later with [[Wilhelm II of Germany|Kaiser Wilhelm II]]<ref name=\"marchione11\">Marchione, 2004, p. 11</ref> and Chancellor [[Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg]], who replied positively to the Papal initiative. However, Bethmann-Hollweg was forced to resign and the German High Command, hoping for a military victory, delayed the German reply until 20 September.\n\nSister Pascalina later recalled that the Nuncio was heartbroken that the Kaiser turned a \"deaf ear to all his proposals\". She later wrote, \"Thinking back today on that time, when we Germans still all believed that our weapons would be victorious and the Nuncio was deeply sorry that the chance had been missed to save what there was to save, it occurs to me over and over again how clearly he foresaw what was to come. Once as he traced the course of the [[Rhine]] with his finger on a map, he said sadly, 'No doubt this will be lost as well'. I did not want to believe it, but here, too, he was to be proved right.\"<ref>Lehnert (2014), pages 5-6.</ref>\n\nFor the remainder of the Great War, Pacelli concentrated on Benedict's humanitarian efforts<ref>Rychlak, 2000, p. 6</ref> especially among Allied POWs in German custody.<ref>Lehnert (2014), 6-7.</ref> In the upheaval following the Armistice, a disconcerted Pacelli sought Benedict XV's permission to leave Munich, where [[Kurt Eisner]] had formed the [[Free State of Bavaria]], and he left for a while to [[Rorschach, St. Gallen|Rorschach]], and a tranquil Swiss sanatorium run by nuns. Monsignor Schioppa, the ''uditore'', was left in Munich.<ref>Cornwell, p. 73</ref>\n\n\"His recovery began with a 'rapport{{'\"}} with the 24-year-old Sister [[Pascalina Lehnert]]\u2014she would soon be transferred to Munich when Pacelli \"pulled strings at the highest level\".<ref>Noel, p. 34</ref>\n\nWhen he returned to Munich, following Eisner's assassination by an anti-Semitic extreme nationalist, [[Anton Graf von Arco auf Valley|Count Anton von Arco auf Valley]], he informed Gasparri-using Schioppa's eye-witness testimony of the chaotic scene at the former royal palace as the trio of [[Max Levien]], [[Eugen Levine]], and [[Towia Axelrod]] sought power: \"the scene was indescribable [-] the confusion totally chaotic [-] in the midst of all this, a gang of young women, of dubious appearance, Jews like the rest of them hanging around [-] the boss of this female rabble was Levien's mistress, a young Russian woman, a Jew and a divorc\u00e9e [-] and it was to her that the nunciature was obliged to pay homage in order to proceed [-] Levien is a young man, also Russian and a Jew. Pale, dirty, with drugged eyes, vulgar, repulsive ...\" John Cornwell alleges that a worrying impression of anti-Semitism is discernible in the \"catalogue of epithets describing their physical and moral repulsiveness\" and Pacelli's \"constant harping on the Jewishness of this party of power usurpers\" chimed with the \"growing and widespread belief among Germans that the Jews were the instigators of the Bolshevik revolution, their principal aim being the destruction of Christian civilization\".<ref>Cornwell, p. 75</ref> Also according to Cornwell, Pacelli informed Gasparri that \"the capital of Bavaria, is suffering under a harsh Jewish-Russian revolutionary tyranny\".<ref>{{cite book|author=John Cornwell|title=Hitler's Pope: The Secret History of Pius XII|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mFHKrYwv87sC&pg=PA78|year=2000|publisher=Penguin|page=78|isbn=9780140296273}}</ref>\n[[File:PacelliBavaria1922a.JPG|thumb|right|145px|Pacelli in Bavaria, 1922]]\n\nAccording to Sister Pascalina Lehnert, the Nuncio was repeatedly threatened by emissaries of the Bavarian Soviet Republic. Once, in a violation of international law, the Bavarian Revolutionary Government attempted to confiscate the Nunciature's car at gunpoint. Despite their demands, however, Pacelli refused to leave his post.<ref>Lehnert (2014), pages 7-8.</ref>\n\nAfter the [[Bavarian Soviet Republic|Munich Soviet Republic]] was defeated and toppled by [[Freikorps]] and [[Reichswehr]] troops, the Nuncio focused on, according to Lehnert, \"alleviating the distress of the postwar period, consoling, supporting all in word and deed\".<ref>Lehnert (2014), page 8.</ref>\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-00535, Bamberg, 900 Jahr-Feier der Stadt.jpg|thumb|left|Nuncio Pacelli in July 1924 at the 900th anniversary of the City of [[Bamberg]]]]\nPacelli was appointed [[Apostolic Nuncio to Germany]] on 23 June 1920, and\u2014after the completion of a Bavarian concordat\u2014his nunciature was moved to Berlin in August 1925. Many of Pacelli's Munich staff stayed with him for the rest of his life, including his advisor [[Robert Leiber]] and Sister [[Pascalina Lehnert]]\u2014housekeeper, cook, friend, and adviser for 41 years. In Berlin, Pacelli was Dean of the Diplomatic Corps and active in diplomatic and many social activities. He was aided by the German priest [[Ludwig Kaas]], who was known for his expertise in Church-state relations and was a full-time politician, politically active in the Catholic [[Centre Party (Germany)|Centre Party]], a party he led following [[Wilhelm Marx]]'s resignation in October 1928.<ref>Volk, 1972; Cornwell, p. 96</ref> While in Germany, he travelled to all regions, attended [[Katholikentag]] (national gatherings of the faithful), and delivered some 50 sermons and speeches to the German people.<ref>Kaas, 1930.</ref> In Berlin he lived in the [[Tiergarten (Berlin)|Tiergarten]] quarter and threw parties for the official and diplomatic elite. [[Paul von Hindenburg]], [[Gustav Stresemann]], and other members of the Cabinet were regular guests.\n\n[[File:Future Pope Pius XII visits Dorstfeld Mines in 1927 Germany.jpg|thumb|Nuncio Pacelli visits the coal mine Dorstfeld on the occasion of the ''[[Katholikentag]]'' in [[Dortmund]] in 1927 Germany]]\n\nIn post-war Germany, in the absence of a nuncio in Moscow, Pacelli worked also on diplomatic arrangements between the Vatican and the Soviet Union. He negotiated food shipments for Russia, where the Church was persecuted. He met with Soviet representatives including Foreign Minister [[Georgi Chicherin]], who rejected any kind of religious education, the ordination of priests and bishops, but offered agreements without the points vital to the Vatican.<ref>Stehle, 1975, pp. 139\u201341</ref>\n\nDespite Vatican pessimism and a lack of visible progress, Pacelli continued the secret negotiations, until [[Pius XI]] ordered them to be discontinued in 1927. Pacelli supported German diplomatic activity aimed at rejection of punitive measures from victorious former enemies. He blocked French attempts for an ecclesiastical separation of the [[Saar (League of Nations)|Saar region]], supported the appointment of a papal administrator for [[Danzig]] and aided the reintegration of priests expelled from Poland.<ref>Morsey, p. 121</ref> A Prussian Concordat was signed on 14 June 1929.

In 1935, Pacelli was named [[Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church]].\n\nAs Cardinal Secretary of State, Pacelli signed concordats with a number of countries and states. Immediately on becoming Cardinal Secretary of State, Pacelli and Ludwig Kaas took up negotiations on a [[Baden]] Concordat which continued until the spring and summer of 1932. Papal fiat appointed a supporter of Pacelli and his concordat policy, [[Conrad Gr\u00f6ber]], the new [[Archbishop of Freiburg]], and the treaty was signed in August\n1932.<ref>Kent, 2002, p. 24</ref> Others followed: Austria (1933), Germany (1933), [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] (1935) and Portugal (1940). The [[Lateran treaties]] with Italy (1929) were concluded before Pacelli became Secretary of State. Catholicism had become the sole recognized religion; the powerful democratic [[Italian People's Party (1919)|Catholic Popular Party]], in many ways similar to the Centre Party in Germany, had been disbanded, and in place of political Catholicism the Holy See encouraged [[Catholic Action]], \"an anaemic form of clerically dominated religious rally-rousing\". It was permitted only so long as it developed \"its activity outside every political party and in direct dependence upon the Church hierarchy for the dissemination and implementation of Catholic principles\".<ref>Cornwell, p. 115</ref> Such concordats allowed the Catholic Church to organize youth groups, make ecclesiastical appointments, run schools, hospitals, and charities, or even conduct religious services. They also ensured that canon law would be recognized within some spheres (e.g., church decrees of [[Nullity (conflict)|nullity]] in the area of marriage).<ref>Fahlbusch, Erwin (ed.). Bromiley, Geoffrey W. (trans.) (2005). ''The Encyclopedia of Christianity''; {{ISBN|0-8028-2416-1}}</ref>\n\nAs the decade began Pacelli wanted the Centre Party in Germany to turn away from the socialists. In the summer of 1931 he clashed with Catholic chancellor [[Heinrich Bruning]], who frankly told Pacelli he believed that he \"misunderstood the political situation in Germany and the real character of the Nazis\".<ref>Cornwell, p. 121</ref> Following Bruning's resignation in May 1932 Pacelli, like the new Catholic chancellor [[Franz von Papen]], wondered if the Centre Party should look to the Right for a coalition, \"that would correspond to their principles\".<ref>Cornwell, p. 128. Pacelli, quoted in Scholder's ''The Churches and the Third Reich'', p. 157</ref> He made many diplomatic visits throughout Europe and the Americas, including an [[Eugenio Pacelli's 1936 visit to the United States|extensive visit to the United States in 1936]] where he met President [[Franklin D.

The state concordats were necessary because the German [[federalism|federalist]] Weimar constitution gave the German states authority in the area of education and culture and thus diminished the authority of the churches in these areas; this diminution of church authority was a primary concern of the Vatican. As Bavarian Nuncio, Pacelli negotiated successfully with the Bavarian authorities in 1925. He expected the concordat with Catholic Bavaria to be the model for the rest of Germany.<ref name=\"Volk\">Ludwig Volk, Die Kirche in den deutschsprachigen L\u00e4ndern in: ''Handbuch der Kirchengeschichte, Band VII'', p. 539</ref><ref>Donald J.

However, Pacelli obtained less favorable conditions for the Church in the Prussian concordat of 1929, which excluded educational issues. A concordat with the German state of Baden was completed by Pacelli in 1932, after he had moved to Rome. There he also negotiated a concordat with Austria in 1933.<ref>Volk, pp. 539\u2013544</ref> A total of 16 concordats and treaties with European states had been concluded in the ten-year period 1922\u20131932.<ref>They included: Latvia 1922, Bavaria 1925, Poland 1925, France I., 1926, France II. 1926, Lithuania 1927, Czechoslovakia 1928, Portugal I 1928, Italy I 1929, Italy II 1929, Portugal II 1929, Romania I 1927, Prussia 1929, Romania II 1932, Baden 1932, Germany 1933, Austria 1933.

It remains the most important of Pacelli's concordats. It is debated, not because of its content, which is still valid today, but because of its timing. A national concordat with Germany was one of Pacelli's main objectives as secretary of state, because he had hoped to strengthen the legal position of the Church. Pacelli, who knew German conditions well, emphasized in particular protection for Catholic associations (\u00a731), freedom for education and Catholic schools, and freedom for publications.<ref>Ludwig Volk, \"Die Kirche in den deutschsprachigen L\u00e4ndern\" in: ''Handbuch der Kirchengeschichte, Band VII'', pp. 546\u2013547</ref>\n\nAs [[nuncio]] during the 1920s, he had made unsuccessful attempts to obtain German agreement for such a treaty, and between 1930 and 1933 he attempted to initiate negotiations with representatives of successive German governments, but the opposition of Protestant and Socialist parties, the instability of national governments and the care of the individual states to guard their autonomy thwarted this aim. In particular, the questions of denominational schools and pastoral work in the armed forces prevented any agreement on the national level, despite talks in the winter of 1932.<ref>Ludwig Volk ''Das Reichskonkordat vom 20.

Most notably, early in 1937, Pacelli asked several German cardinals, including Cardinal [[Michael von Faulhaber]] to help him write a protest of Nazi violations of the ''Reichskonkordat''; this was to become Pius XI's 1937 encyclical, ''[[Mit brennender Sorge]]''. The encyclical was written in German and not the usual [[Latin]] of official Catholic Church documents.

Smuggled into Germany, it was read from all the Catholic pulpits on Palm Sunday in March 1937. It exposed the fallacy and denounced the Nazi myth of blood and soil; it decried its neopaganism, its war of annihilation against the Church, and even described the F\u00fchrer himself as a 'mad prophet possessed of repulsive arrogance'.

According to rumours, he asked for another ballot to be taken to ensure the validity of his election. After his election was indeed confirmed, he chose the name Pius XII in honour of his immediate predecessor.\n\nHis [[Papal Coronation|coronation]] took place on 12 March 1939. Upon being elected pope he was also formally the Grand Master of the Equestrian [[Order of the Holy Sepulchre]] of Jerusalem, [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith|prefect of the Supreme Sacred Congregation of the Holy Office]], [[Congregation for the Oriental Churches|prefect of the Sacred Congregation for the Oriental Churches]] and [[Congregation for Bishops|prefect of the Sacred Consistorial Congregation]].

Cardinal Maglione, a seasoned Vatican diplomat, had reestablished diplomatic relations with Switzerland and was for many years nuncio in Paris. Yet, Maglione did not exercise the influence of his predecessor Pacelli, who as Pope continued his close relation with Monsignors Montini (later [[Pope Paul VI]]) and [[Domenico Tardini]]. After the death of Maglione in 1944, Pius left the position open and named Tardini head of its foreign section and Montini head of the internal section.<ref>Congregation of Extraordinary Ecclesiastical Affairs and Congregation of Ordinary Affairs</ref> Tardini and Montini continued serving there until 1953, when Pius XII decided to appoint them cardinals,<ref>Pio XII, ''La Allocuzione nel consistorio Segreto del 12 Gennaio 1953'' in Pio XII, Discorsi e Radiomessagi di Sua Santita Vatican City, 1953, p. 455</ref> an honor which both turned down.<ref>Domenico Cardinale Tardini, Pio XII, Tipografia Poliglotta Vaticana, 1960, p. 157</ref> They were then later appointed to be Pro-Secretary with the privilege to wear Episcopal Insignia.<ref>Giulio Nicolini, Il Cardinale Domenico Tardini, Padova, 1980; {{ISBN|88-7026-340-1}}; p. 313</ref> Tardini continued to be a close co-worker of the Pope until the death of Pius XII, while Montini became archbishop of [[Milan]], after the death of [[Alfredo Ildefonso Schuster]].\n\nPius XII slowly eroded the Italian monopoly on the [[Roman Curia]]; he employed German and [[Dutch people|Dutch]] [[Jesuit]] advisors, Robert Leiber, [[Augustin Bea]], and [[Sebastian Tromp]]. He also supported the elevation of Americans such as Cardinal [[Francis Spellman]] from a minor to a major role in the Church.<ref>In the Secretariat of State he had actively supported \"foreigners\", for example Francis Spellman, the American monsignor, whom he consecrated himself as the first American Bishop in the Vatican curia.

Pius XII chose not to name new cardinals during World War II, and the number of cardinals shrank to 38, with [[Dennis Joseph Dougherty]] of [[Philadelphia]] being the only living U.S. cardinal. The first occasion on 18 February 1946\u2014which has become known as the \"Grand Consistory\"\u2014yielded the elevation of a record 32 new cardinals, almost 50 percent of the College of Cardinals and reaching the canonical limit of 70 cardinals.<ref>(previously [[Pope Leo X|Leo X]]'s elevation of 31 cardinals in 1517 had held this title). [[Pope John Paul II|John Paul II]] surpassed this number on 21 February 2001, elevating 44 cardinals. By that time, the limit had been suspended and over 120 Cardinals existed.</ref> In the 1946 consistory, Pius XII, while maintaining the maximum size of the College of Cardinals at 70, named cardinals from [[China]], [[India]], the [[Middle East]] and increased the number of Cardinals from the Americas, proportionally lessening the Italian influence.<ref>Oscar Halecki, James Murray, Jr. ''Pius XII, Eugenio Pacelli, Pope of Peace'', p. 371</ref>\n\nIn his second consistory on 12 January 1953, it was expected that his closest co-workers, Msgrs.

Pius XII freed biblical research from previous limitations. He encouraged Christian theologians to revisit original versions of the Bible in [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Hebrew]]. Noting improvements in [[archaeology]], the encyclical reversed Pope Leo XIII's encyclical, which had only advocated going back to the original texts to resolve ambiguity in the [[Latin Vulgate]]. The encyclical demands a much better understanding of ancient Hebrew history and traditions. It requires bishops throughout the Church to initiate [[biblical studies]] for lay people. The Pontiff also requests a reorientation of Catholic teaching and education, relying much more on sacred scriptures in [[sermon]]s and religious instruction.<ref>AAS, 1943, p. 305</ref>\n\n====The role of theology====\nThis theological investigative freedom does not, however, extend to all aspects of theology. According to Pius, theologians, employed by the Church, are assistants, to teach the official teachings of the Church and not their own private thoughts. They are free to engage in empirical research, which the Church generously supports, but in matters of [[morality]] and religion, they are subjected to the teaching office and authority of the Church, the [[Magisterium]]. \"The most noble office of theology is to show how a doctrine defined by the Church is contained in the sources of revelation, ... in that sense in which it has been defined by the Church.\"<ref>Pius XII, Enc.

He also took on issues like the uses of medicine in [[terminally ill]] persons, medical lies in face of grave illness, and the rights of family members to make decisions against expert medical advice.

Catholics must believe that the human soul was created immediately by God.

The pontificate of Pius XII was the first in Vatican history that published papal speeches and addresses in [[vernacular]] language on a systematic basis. Until then, papal documents were issued mainly in [[Latin]] in ''[[Acta Apostolicae Sedis]]'' since 1909. Because of the novelty of it all, and a feared [[military occupation|occupation]] of the Vatican by the German [[Wehrmacht]], not all documents exist today. In 1944, a number of papal documents were burned or \"walled in\",<ref>Communication, Father Robert Graham, SJ, 10 November 1992</ref> to avoid detection by the advancing German army. Insisting that all publications must be reviewed by him on a prior basis to avoid any misunderstanding, several speeches by Pius XII, who did not find sufficient time, were never published or appeared only once issued in the Vatican daily, ''[[Osservatore Romano]]''.\n\nSeveral encyclicals addressed the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]]. ''[[Orientalis Ecclesiae]]'' was issued in 1944 on the 15th centenary of the death of [[Cyril of Alexandria]], a saint common to [[Eastern Christianity]] and [[Latin]] Churches. Pius XII asks for prayer for better understanding and unification of the Churches. ''[[Orientales omnes Ecclesias]]'', issued in 1945 on the 350th anniversary of the reunion, is a call to continued unity of the [[Ruthenian Greek Catholic Church]], threatened in its very existence by the authorities of the Soviet Union. ''[[Sempiternus Rex]]'' was issued in 1951 on the 1500th anniversary of the Ecumenical [[Council of Chalcedon]]. It included a call to oriental communities adhering to [[Miaphysite]] theology to return to the Catholic Church. ''Orientales Ecclesias'' was issued in 1952 and addressed to the Eastern Churches, protesting the continued [[Stalinist]] persecution of the Church. Several [[Apostolic Letter]]s were sent to the bishops in the East. On 13 May 1956, Pope Pius addressed all bishops of the Eastern Rite. Mary, the mother of God, was the subject of encyclical letters to the people of Russia in ''[[Fulgens corona]]'', as well as a papal letter to the people of Russia.<ref>''Orientalis Ecclesiae'', AAS, 1944, p. 129</ref><ref>''Orientales omnes Ecclesias'', AAS, 1946, pp. 33\u201363.</ref><ref>''Sempiternus Rex'', AAS, 1951, pp. 625\u201344.</ref><ref>''Orientales Ecclesias''.

Subsequently, the Catholic Church in Poland abandoned direct intervention, instead focusing on organizing underground aid, with huge international support orchestrated by Pope Pius XII and his Holy See.

His encyclicals, ''[[Evangelii praecones]]'' and ''[[Fidei donum]]'', issued on 2 June 1951 and 21 April 1957, respectively, increased the local decision-making of Catholic missions, many of which became independent dioceses. Pius XII demanded recognition of local cultures as fully equal to European culture.<ref>Audience for the directors of mission activities in 1944 A.A.S., 1944, p. 208</ref><ref>''[[Evangelii praecones]]''. p. 56</ref> Though his language retained old conceptions&nbsp;\u2013 Africa, for example, merited special attention since the church there worked 'to forward her work among the heathen multitudes' \u2013 in 1956 he expressed solidarity with the 'non-Europeans who aspire to full political independence'. <ref>Robert Ventresca, Soldier of Christ, p.282-283</ref> Continuing the line of his predecessors, Pius XII supported the establishment of local administration in Church affairs: in 1950, the hierarchy of Western Africa became independent; in 1951, Southern Africa; and in 1953, [[British East Africa]]. Finland, [[Burma]] and [[French Africa]] became independent dioceses in 1955.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the war, Pius XII [[Cardinals created by Pope Pius XII in 1946|elevated a number]] of high-profile resistors of Nazism to the College of Cardinals in 1946, among them the German Bishops [[Joseph Frings]] of Cologne, [[Clemens August Graf von Galen|Clemens von Galen]] of M\u00fcnster and [[Konrad von Preysing]] of Berlin. From elsewhere in the liberated [[Greater Germanic Reich|Nazi Empire]] Pius selected other resistors: Dutch Archbishop [[Johannes de Jong]]; Hungarian Bishop [[J\u00f3zsef Mindszenty]]; Polish Archbishop [[Adam Stefan Sapieha]]; and French Archbishop [[Jules-G\u00e9raud Sali\u00e8ge]]. In 1946 and 1953, respectively, he named as cardinals [[Thomas Tien Ken-sin|Thomas Tien]] of China and [[Valerian Gracias]] of India&nbsp;\u2013 the first indigenous Catholics of their respective nations to sit in the [[College of Cardinals]].<ref>Ventresca, p.284</ref> Italian Papal diplomat [[Angelo Roncalli]] (later Pope John XXIII) and Polish Archbishop [[Stefan Wyszy\u0144ski]] were others among those [[Cardinals created by Pope Pius XII in 1953|elevated in 1953]].\n\nA German contingent dominated his inner circle at this period&nbsp;\u2013 the German Jesuits [[Robert Leiber]], Wilhelm Hentrich and Ivo Zeiger. His personal confessor Augustin Bea was a German Jesuit and Mother Pascalina Lehnert and the other German speaking sisters of the papal household added to this element. The American bishop [[Aloisius Muench]] wrote in November 1948 that Pius XII was 'more interested in affairs of the Church in Germany than in any other part of the Church' and resolved to make the postwar German crisis a top priority \u2013 'its refugee crisis, poverty, hunger and disease, the fate of prisoners-of-war and accused war criminals, the disruption to the internal organization and communal life of German Catholicism, and Germany's uncertain political future'.<ref>Robert Ventresca, Soldier of Christ, p.240</ref>\n\nHe was concerned too about the potential spread of Communism in Western Europe and the Americas. As he sought to secure resources from abroad to aid post-war recovery, believing deprivation fuelled political agitation, so he also sought to influence Italian politics. In January 1948, Luigi Gedda, of Italy's [[Catholic Action]] movement, was called to the Vatican as the campaign for the first parliament of Italy's post-fascist republic was underway.<ref>Robert Ventresca, Soldier of Christ, p.242</ref> The Communists and Socialists seemed headed for victory and Pius XII wanted Catholic Action, an organization of Catholic laity, to mobilise the Catholic vote against parties of the Left. In July 1949 he approved a controversial move by the Holy Office to threaten with [[excommunication]] anyone with known Communist affiliations. A group of Jesuits around the journal ''[[La Civilta Cattolica]]'', active in Vatican circles, further spread alarm that ''fifth columns'' of Soviet Communism were active in Western Europe poised to exploit popular discontent to aid Soviet expansionism. He was responsible for giving the appellative title, The Catholic University of the Philippines to the then [[Pontifical]] and Royal [[University of Santo Tomas]].\n\nPius XII was rather distrustful of [[Alcide de Gasperi]] and [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Italy's Christian Democrats]], considering the party indecisive and fractious&nbsp;\u2013 reformist currents within it particularly, which tended to the moderate Left&nbsp;\u2013 represented by the Sicilian priest [[Luigi Sturzo]] for example&nbsp;\u2013 he considered too accommodating to the Left. On the eve of the 1952 local elections in Rome, in which again the Communist and Socialist parties threatened to win out, he used informal connections to make his views known. Pius XII stated that the war against communism was a holy war and excommunicated members of the Communist Party. Having decided to encourage the Christian Democrats to consider a political alliance with the Rightist parties as part of an anti-left coalition, he asked the Jesuit, Father Riccardo Lombardi, to speak with de Gasperi to consider such an alliance&nbsp;\u2013 an electoral alliance with those even of monarchist and neo-fascist tendencies -including the [[Italian Social Movement]]. Adopting a domino theory he warned that, if \"the Communists win in Rome, in Italy, it will cast a shadow on the entire world: France would become Communist, and then Spain and then all of Europe'.<ref>Robert Ventresca, Soldier of Christ, p.246</ref> de Gasperi rejected the idea as politically dangerous to the long term fortunes of a centrist Catholic party.\n\n==Later life, illness and death==\n===Late years of Pope Pius XII===\n{{Main article|Late years of Pope Pius XII}}\nThe last years of the [[pontificate]] of Pius XII began in late 1954 with a long illness, during which he considered [[abdication]]. Afterwards, changes in his work habit became noticeable. The Pope avoided long ceremonies, canonizations and consistories and displayed hesitancy in personnel matters. He found it increasingly difficult to chastise subordinates and appointees such as his physician, [[Riccardo Galeazzi-Lisi]], who after numerous indiscretions was excluded from Papal service for the last years, but, keeping his title, was able to enter the papal apartments to make photos of the dying Pope, which he sold to French magazines.<ref>Schneider, p. 80</ref> Pius underwent three courses of [[Rejuvenation (aging)|cellular rejuvenation]] treatment administered by [[Paul Niehans]], the most important in 1954 when Pacelli was gravely ill. Side-effects of the treatment included hallucinations, from which the Pope suffered in his last years. \"These years were also plagued by horrific nightmares. Pacelli's blood-curdling screams could be heard throughout the papal apartments.\"<ref>Gerard Noel, ''Pius XII, The Hound of Hitler'', p. 3</ref>\n\nPius XII often elevated young priests as bishops, such as [[Julius D\u00f6pfner]] (35 years) and Karol Wojtyla (later [[Pope John Paul II]], 38 years), one of his last appointees in 1958. He took a firm stand against pastoral experiments, such as \"[[worker-priest]]s\", who worked full-time in factories and joined political parties and unions. He continued to defend the theological tradition of [[Thomism]] as worthy of continued reform, and as superior to modern trends such as [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] or [[existentialism]].<ref>See ''[[Humani generis]]''.</ref>\n\n===Illness and death===\n[[File:Tumulo pio xii.jpg|thumb|''The Pope of Mary'': A [[Madonna and Child]], added by John Paul II in 1982, hangs over the tomb of Pius XII.]]\nWith frequent absences from work, Pope Pius XII had come to depend heavily on a few close colleagues, especially his aide [[Domenico Tardini]], his speechwriter [[Robert Leiber]], and his long-serving housekeeper [[Pascalina Lehnert]]. The Pope still addressed lay people and groups about a wide range of topics. Sometimes he answered specific moral questions, which were addressed to him. To professional associations he explained specific occupational ethics in light of Church teachings. Robert Leiber helped him occasionally with his speeches and publications. [[Augustin Bea|Cardinal Augustine Bea SJ]] was his personal confessor. [[Pascalina Lehnert|Sister Pasqualina]] was for forty years his \"housekeeper, muse and lifelong companion\".<ref>Noel, p. 4</ref>\n\nOn 5 October 1958, at his summer residence [[Castel Gandolfo]], the Pope suffered painful complications, but tried to continue his duties between intervals of rest. Next morning, the doctors came to pump his stomach, apparently with success, but he lost consciousness and was given the last rites. Presently he awoke, and the nuns opened the door to the Papal Chapel so he could see and hear them praying the rosary. The next day, he appeared to improve and received visitors. When they opened the window in the evening, he looked out at the stars and said quietly \"Look, how beautiful, how great is our Lord\u201d. On the last full day of his life, his temperature rose steadily and his breathing became difficult. At 3.52 a.m. on 9 October, he gave a smile, lowered his head and died. The cause of death was recorded as acute [[heart failure]]. Monsignor Domenico Tardini prayed the ''Magnificat Anima mea dominum'', the Virgin Mary's praise of the Lord, in Latin. His doctor Gaspanini said afterwards: \"The Holy Father did not die because of any specific illness. He was completely exhausted. He was overworked beyond limit.

From this we learn that, although Pius's defenders still say that he paid a golden ransom in a vain effort to save Rome's Jews from transportation to the death camps, the most he did was indicate a willingness to chip in if the Jews could not raise the sum demanded. He also shows that no individual Jews were spared, as is often claimed, after Pius personally intervened with the Nazis. Moreover, Katz reveals that those who did escape the Nazi round-up and found sanctuary in church buildings in Rome did so in the face of explicit opposition from the Vatican. The real heroes and heroines were the priests and nuns who refused to bow to Pius's officials and hand over the desperate people whom they were hiding. The main problem with writing about Pius's wartime is that in effect, he did nothing. Facing the murders of six million people, he remained silent. As Jews were taken away from the ghetto that sat right alongside St Peter's, he may have agonised, but he did not intervene. When he did raise his voice with the German occupiers, it was either to ensure that the Vatican City state would not be compromised\u2014that is to say, he would be safe\u2014or to emphasise his own neutrality in a conflict which, for many, became a battle between good and evil. His unrealistic hope was that the Catholic Church could emerge as the peacemaker across Europe. Instead, both the American and British leaderships, as Katz shows, regarded the papacy as tainted by its association with Nazism and irrelevant in the post-1945 reshaping of the continent. Both had urged Pius to speak up against the Holocaust and so drew their own conclusions about him. Far from being a saint, then, he was at best a fool, perhaps an anti-Semite and probably a coward.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/200310130045|title=Catholic guilt|last=Stanford|first=Peter J.|date=13 October 2003|accessdate=8 January 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080904222456/http://www.newstatesman.com/200310130045|archivedate=4 September 2008}} in review of ''Fatal Silence: the pope, the resistance and the German occupation of Rome'', written by Robert Katz; {{ISBN|0-297-84661-2}}.

How Peron Brought the Nazi War Criminals to Argentina'' (2002), the Argentine journalist [[Uki Go\u00f1i]] described how the Argentinean government dealt with war criminals that entered Argentina. However, during his research Go\u00f1i accidentally stumbled on documents of the British Foreign Office about the involvement of Vatican personnel in the smuggling of war criminals, the so-called [[Ratlines (history)|post-war \"ratlines\"]]. Go\u00f1i found out that the British Envoy [[D'Arcy Osborne, 12th Duke of Leeds|D'Arcy Osborne]] had intervened with Pope Pius XII to put an end to these illegal activities. Furthermore, he discovered \"that the Pope secretly pleaded with Washington and London on behalf of notorious criminals and Nazi collaborators\".<ref>Go\u00f1i, afterword to the revised 2003 edition, pp. 327\u2013348.</ref> Suzanne Brown-Fleming's ''The Holocaust and Catholic Conscience. Cardinal Aloisius Muench and the Guilt Question in Germany'' (2006) underlines Go\u00f1i's findings. In her remarkable study, Brown-Fleming clearly demonstrated how Pius XII intervened on behalf of rather vicious German war criminals (e.g. [[Otto Ohlendorf]]). Brown-Fleming's main source was the archive of Pope Pius XII's representative in post-war Germany, [[Aloisius Joseph Muench|Cardinal Aloisius Muench]].<ref>Brown-Fleming, 2006, Chapter 4: ''Granting Absolution. Muench and the Catholic Clemency Campaign''.</ref> Then, Phayer's ''[[Pius XII, The Holocaust, and the Cold War]]'' (2008) makes use of many documents that have recently come to light thanks to [[Bill Clinton]]'s 1997 executive order declassifying wartime and postwar documents, many of which are currently at the [[US National Archives]] and [[Holocaust Memorial Museum]]. These documents include diplomatic correspondence, American espionage, and even decryptions of German communications. Relevant documents have also been released by the [[Argentine government]] and the British Foreign Office and other information sources have become available, including the diary of Bishop [[Joseph Patrick Hurley|Hurley]]. These documents reveal new information about Pius XII's actions regarding the [[Usta\u0161e]] regime, the genocides in Poland, the finances of the wartime church, the deportation of the Roman Jews, and the ratlines for Nazis and fascists fleeing Europe.<ref>Phayer, 2008, pp. xi\u2013xvi</ref> According to Phayer, \"the face of Pope Pius that we see in these documents is not the same face we see in the eleven volumes the Vatican published of World War II documents, a collection which, though valuable, is nonetheless critically flawed because of its many omissions\".<ref>Phayer, 2008, p. xi</ref>\n\nOn 19 September 2008, Pope [[Benedict XVI]] held a reception for conference participants during which he praised Pius XII as a pope who made every effort to save Jews during the war.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/speeches/2008/september/documents/hf_ben-xvi_spe_20080918_pave-the-way_en.html|title=Address at the conclusion of the symposium organized by the \"Pave the Way Foundation\"|publisher=Vatican.va|date=19 September 2008|accessdate=6 May 2009}}</ref> A second conference was held from 6\u20138 November 2008 by the Pontifical Academy of Life.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/new.php?n=12968|title=Vatican recalls life and teachings of Pius XII 50 years after his death|publisher=Catholicnewsagency.com|accessdate=6 May 2009}}</ref>\n\nOn 9 October 2008, the 50th anniversary of Pius XII's death, Benedict XVI celebrated pontifical Mass in his memory.
