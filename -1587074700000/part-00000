It can read and write over 200 [[image file formats]].\n\n==History==\nImageMagick was created in 1987 by John Cristy when working at [[DuPont]], to convert 24-bit images (16 million colors) to 8-bit images (256 colors), so they could be displayed on most screens. It was freely released in 1990 when DuPont agreed to transfer copyright to ''ImageMagick Studio LLC'', still currently the project maintainer organization.<ref name=\"history\" />\n\nIn May 2016, it was reported that ImageMagick had a vulnerability through which an attacker can execute arbitrary code on servers that use the application to edit user-uploaded images.<ref name=\"exploits-ars-technica\" /> Security experts including CloudFlare researchers observed actual use of the vulnerability in active hacking attempts.<ref name=\"exploits-cloudflare\" /> The security flaw was due to ImageMagick calling backend tools without first properly checking to ensure path and file names are free of improper shell commands.<ref name=\"exploits-register\" /> The vulnerability did not affect ImageMagick distributions that included a properly configured [[security policy]].\n\n==Features and capabilities==\nThe software mainly consists of a number of [[command-line interface]] utilities for manipulating images. ImageMagick does not have a robust [[graphical user interface]] to edit images as do [[Adobe Photoshop]] and [[GIMP]], but does include \u2013 for [[Unix-like]] [[operating system]]s \u2013 a basic native [[X Window]] [[graphical user interface|GUI]] (called IMDisplay) for rendering and manipulating images and [[Application programming interface|API]] libraries for many programming languages.\n\nExecute the following on Linux or UNIX to launch the GUI:<ref name=\"native-gui\" />\n\n:<code>$ display</code>\n\nOtherwise, images may be edited directly by various command-line parameters without launching a GUI at all. The program uses [[magic number (programming)|magic numbers]] to identify image [[file format]]s.\n\nFor a full list of supported formats, execute, on Linux or UNIX:\n\n:<code>$ identify -list format</code>\n\nA number of programs, such as [[Drupal]], [[MediaWiki]], [[phpBB]], and [[vBulletin]], can use ImageMagick to create image [[thumbnail]]s if installed. ImageMagick is also used by other programs, such as [[LyX]], for converting images.\n\nImageMagick has a fully integrated [[Perl]] [[Language binding|binding]] called PerlMagick,<ref name=\"perl-magick\" /> as well as many others: G2F (Ada), MagickCore (C), MagickWand (C), ChMagick (Ch), ImageMagickObject (COM+), Magick++ (C++), JMagick (Java), L-Magick (Lisp), NMagick (Neko/Haxe), MagickNet (.NET), PascalMagick (Pascal), MagickWand for PHP (PHP), IMagick (PHP), PythonMagick (Python), RMagick (Ruby), or TclMagick (Tcl/TK).\n\n===File format conversion===\nOne of the basic and thoroughly-implemented features of ImageMagick is its ability to efficiently and accurately convert images between different file formats (it uses the command <code>convert</code> to achieve this).\n\n===Color quantization===\nThe number of colors in an image can be reduced to an arbitrary number and this is done by weighing the most prominent color values present among the pixels of the image.\n\nA related capability is the [[posterization]] artistic effect, which also reduces the number of colors represented in an image. The difference between this and standard color quantization is that while in standard quantization the final palette is selected based upon a weighting of the prominence of existing colors in the image, posterization creates a palette of colors smoothly distributed across the spectrum represented in the image. Whereas with standard color quantization all of the final color values are ones that were in the original image, the color values in a posterized image may not have been present in the original image but are in between the original color values.\n\n===Dithering===\nA fine control is provided for the [[dither#Digital photography and image processing|dithering]] that occurs during color and shading alterations, including the ability to generate [[halftone]] dithering.\n\n===Liquid rescaling===\nIn 2008, support for [[seam carving|liquid rescaling]] was added.<ref name=\"changelog\" /> This feature allows, for example, [[aspect ratio (image)|rescaling]] 4:3 images into 16:9 images without distorting the image.\n\n===Artistic effects===\nImageMagick includes a variety of filters and features intended to create artistic effects:\n* Charcoal sketch transform\n* [[Posterization]]\n\n===OpenCL===\nImageMagick can use [[OpenCL]] to use an accelerated graphics card ([[GPU]]) for processing.<ref name=\"architecture\" />\n\n===Deep color===\nThe Q8 version supports up-to 8 bits-per-pixel component (8-bit grayscale, 24- or 32-bit RGB color). The Q16 version supports up-to 16 bits-per-pixel component (16-bit grayscale, up-to 48- or 64-bit RGB color).\n\n===Other===\nBelow are some other features of ImageMagick:\n* [[Data conversion|Format conversion]]: convert an image from one format to another (e.g. [[portable Network Graphics|PNG]] to [[JPEG]]).\n* Transform: resize, rotate, crop, flip or trim an image. (Applies these without [[generation loss]] on JPEG files, where possible.)\n* Transparency: render portions of an image invisible.\n* Draw: add shapes or text to an image.\n* Decorate: add a border or frame to an image.\n* Special effects: blur, sharpen, threshold, or tint an image.\n* Animation: assemble a [[Graphics Interchange Format|GIF]] animation file from a sequence of images.\n* Text & comments: insert descriptive or artistic text in an image.\n* Image identification: describe the format and attributes of an image.\n* Composite: overlap one image over another.\n* Montage: juxtapose image thumbnails on an image canvas.\n* Generalized pixel distortion: correct for, or induce image distortions including perspective.\n* Morphology of shapes: extract features, describe shapes and recognize patterns in images.\n* Motion picture support: read and write the common image formats used in digital film work.\n* Image calculator: apply a mathematical expression to an image or image channels.\n* [[Discrete Fourier transform]]: implements forward and inverse DFT.\n* Color management: accurate color management with color profiles or in lieu of \u2013 built-in [[gamma compression]] or expansion as demanded by the colorspace.\n* High-dynamic-range images: accurately represent the wide range of intensity levels found in real scenes ranging from the brightest direct sunlight to the deepest darkest shadows.\n* Encipher or decipher an image: convert ordinary images into unintelligible gibberish and back again.\n* Virtual pixel support: convenient access to pixels outside the image region.\n* Large image support: read, process, or write mega-, giga-, or tera-pixel image sizes.\n* Threads of execution support: ImageMagick is [[thread safe]] and most internal algorithms execute in parallel to take advantage of speed-ups offered by [[multi-core processor]] chips.\n* Heterogeneous distributed processing: certain algorithms are OpenCL-enabled to take advantage of speed-ups offered by executing in concert across heterogeneous platforms consisting of CPUs, GPUs, and other processors.\n* Distributed pixel cache: offload intermediate pixel storage to one or more remote servers.\n* ImageMagick on the [[iPhone]]: convert, edit, or compose images on your iOS computing device such as the iPhone or [[iPad]].\n\n==Distribution==\nImageMagick is [[cross-platform]], and runs on [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Unix-like]] systems including [[Linux]], [[macOS]], [[iOS]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]], [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]], and [[FreeBSD]]. The project's [[source code]] can be compiled for other systems, including [[AmigaOS 4|AmigaOS 4.0]] and [[MorphOS]]. It has been run under [[IRIX]].<ref name=\"api-install\" />\n\n==Related software==\n[[GraphicsMagick]] is a [[fork (software development)|fork]] of ImageMagick 5.5.2 made in 2002, emphasizing the cross-release stability of the programming [[application programming interface|API]] and command-line options. GraphicsMagick emerged as a result of irreconcilable differences in the developers' group.<ref name=\"mailing-list\" />\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Free and open-source software}}\n\n* [[DevIL]]\n* [[GD Graphics Library]]\n* [[Netpbm]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"history-quote\">{{cite web|url=https://www.imagemagick.org/script/history.php|title=History|website=ImageMagick|quote=...Dr. Pensak had to convince upper management at DuPont....Either way, ImageMagick would not be available today without DuPont transferring the copyright to ImageMagick Studio LLC.

With [[Henry Royce]], he co-founded the [[Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls-Royce]] car manufacturing firm. He was the first Briton to be killed in an aeronautical accident with a powered aircraft, when the tail of his [[Wright Model A|Wright Flyer]] broke off during a flying display in [[Bournemouth]]. He was aged 32.\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Charles Rolls driving medal at Monmouth Museum, Wales.JPG|thumb|right|150px|Driving medals won by Rolls, at [[Monmouth Museum]]]]\nRolls was born in [[Berkeley Square]], London, third son of the [[John Rolls, 1st Baron Llangattock|1st Baron Llangattock]] and [[Lady Llangattock]]. Despite his London birth, he retained a strong family connection with his ancestral home<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/372038 | title=The Hendre | publisher=Geograph Britain and Ireland | accessdate=29 June 2011}}</ref> of [[The Hendre]], near [[Monmouth]], Wales. After attending Mortimer Vicarage [[Preparatory school (UK)|Preparatory School]] in Berkshire, he was educated at [[Eton College]] where his developing interest in engines earned him the nickname \"dirty Rolls\".<ref name=\"The_Magic_Of_A_Name\">{{cite book | last = Pugh | first = Peter | title = The Magic of a Name \u2013 The Rolls-Royce Story: The First 40 Years | publisher = Icon Books | year = 2001 | isbn = 1-84046-151-9 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1894 he attended a private [[Cram school|crammer]] in Cambridge which helped him gain entry to [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], where he studied mechanical and applied science. In 1896, at the age of 18, he travelled to Paris to buy his first car, a [[Peugeot]] [[Phaeton body|Phaeton]], and joined the [[French Automobile Club|Automobile Club of France]]. His Peugeot is believed to have been the first car based in Cambridge, and one of the first three cars owned in Wales. An early motoring enthusiast, he joined the Self-Propelled Traffic Association, which campaigned against the restrictions imposed on motor vehicles by the [[Locomotive Act]], and became a founder member of the [[Royal Automobile Club|Automobile Club of Great Britain]], with which the Association merged in 1897.<ref>{{cite book | last = Vance | first = James | title = Ways of the World: A History of the World's Roads and of the Vehicles That Used Them | publisher = Rutgers University Press | year = 1992 | isbn = 0-8135-2691-4 }}</ref>\n\nRolls was a keen cyclist and spent time at Cambridge bicycle racing. In 1896, he won a [[Blue (university sport)|Half Blue]] and the following year became captain of the Cambridge University Bicycle Club.<ref name=TT39323>Aeroplane Accident, Mr Rolls Killed at Bournemouth.

Rolls also had a collection of bicycles from solos up to four-man tandems.</ref>\n\nRolls graduated from Cambridge in 1898 and began working on the [[steam yacht]] ''Santa Maria'' followed by a position at the [[London and North Western Railway]] in [[Crewe]].<ref name=\"The_Magic_Of_A_Name\"/> However, his talents lay more in salesmanship and motoring pioneering than practical engineering; in January 1903, with the help of \u00a36,600 provided by his father, he started one of Britain's first car dealerships,<ref name=\"BBC\" /> C. S. Rolls & Co. based in [[Fulham]], to import and sell French [[Peugeot]] and Belgian [[Minerva (automobile)|Minerva]] vehicles.\n<!--Rolls was a tall man, standing at about 1.95 m (6'5\"). no citation, unable to verify-->\n\n==Partnership with Royce==\n[[File:Panhard & Levassor autocar, C S Rolls driver and George V.jpg|thumb|right|235px|C.

Rolls driving [[George V of the United Kingdom|the Duke of York]] accompanied by Sir Charles Cust and Rolls' father, Lord Llangattock, at 'The Hendre', 1900]]\n{{Main|Rolls-Royce Limited}}\n\nRolls was introduced to [[Henry Royce]] by a friend at the [[Royal Automobile Club]], Henry Edmunds, who was also a director of Royce Ltd. Edmunds showed him Royce's car and arranged the historic meeting between Rolls and Royce at the [[Midland Hotel (Manchester)|Midland Hotel]], Manchester, on 4 May 1904. In spite of his preference for three or four cylinder cars, Rolls was impressed with the two-cylinder Royce 10 and in a subsequent agreement of 23 December 1904 agreed to take all the cars Royce could make. These would be of two, three, four and six cylinders and would be badged as Rolls-Royces.\n\n[[File:CharlesRolls.jpg|thumb|left|123px|Bronze bust at [[Derby Industrial Museum]]]]\nThe first Rolls-Royce car, the [[Rolls-Royce 10 hp]], was unveiled at the [[Paris Motor Show|Paris Salon]] in December 1904, although in the early advertising it was the name of Rolls that was emphasised over that of Royce. In 1906 Rolls and Royce formalised their partnership by creating Rolls-Royce Limited, with Rolls appointed Technical managing director on a salary of \u00a3750 per annum plus 4% of the profits in excess of \u00a310,000. Rolls provided the financial backing and business acumen to complement Royce's technical expertise. In 1907 Rolls-Royce Limited bought out C. S. Rolls & Co.\n\nRolls put much effort into publicising the quietness and smoothness of the Rolls-Royce, and at the end of 1906 travelled to the US to promote the new cars. The company was winning awards for the quality and reliability of its cars by 1907. But by 1909 Rolls' interest in the business was waning, and at the end of the year he resigned as Technical managing director and became a [[non-executive director]].<ref name=\"The_Magic_Of_A_Name\"/>\n\n[[File:The late C.S.

With [[Henry Royce]], he co-founded the [[Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls-Royce]] car manufacturing firm. He was the first Briton to be killed in an aeronautical accident with a powered aircraft, when the tail of his [[Wright Model A|Wright Flyer]] broke off during a flying display in [[Bournemouth]]. He was aged 32.\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Charles Rolls driving medal at Monmouth Museum, Wales.JPG|thumb|right|150px|Driving medals won by Rolls, at [[Monmouth Museum]]]]\nRolls was born in [[Berkeley Square]], London, third son of the [[John Rolls, 1st Baron Llangattock|1st Baron Llangattock]] and [[Lady Llangattock]]. Despite his London birth, he retained a strong family connection with his ancestral home<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/372038 | title=The Hendre | publisher=Geograph Britain and Ireland | accessdate=29 June 2011}}</ref> of [[The Hendre]], near [[Monmouth]], Wales. After attending Mortimer Vicarage [[Preparatory school (UK)|Preparatory School]] in Berkshire, he was educated at [[Eton College]] where his developing interest in engines earned him the nickname \"dirty Rolls\".<ref name=\"The_Magic_Of_A_Name\">{{cite book | last = Pugh | first = Peter | title = The Magic of a Name \u2013 The Rolls-Royce Story: The First 40 Years | publisher = Icon Books | year = 2001 | isbn = 1-84046-151-9 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1894 he attended a private [[Cram school|crammer]] in Cambridge which helped him gain entry to [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], where he studied mechanical and applied science. In 1896, at the age of 18, he travelled to Paris to buy his first car, a [[Peugeot]] [[Phaeton body|Phaeton]], and joined the [[French Automobile Club|Automobile Club of France]]. His Peugeot is believed to have been the first car based in Cambridge, and one of the first three cars owned in Wales. An early motoring enthusiast, he joined the Self-Propelled Traffic Association, which campaigned against the restrictions imposed on motor vehicles by the [[Locomotive Act]], and became a founder member of the [[Royal Automobile Club|Automobile Club of Great Britain]], with which the Association merged in 1897.<ref>{{cite book | last = Vance | first = James | title = Ways of the World: A History of the World's Roads and of the Vehicles That Used Them | publisher = Rutgers University Press | year = 1992 | isbn = 0-8135-2691-4 }}</ref>\n\nRolls was a keen cyclist and spent time at Cambridge bicycle racing. In 1896, he won a [[Blue (university sport)|Half Blue]] and the following year became captain of the Cambridge University Bicycle Club.<ref name=TT39323>Aeroplane Accident, Mr Rolls Killed at Bournemouth.

Rolls also had a collection of bicycles from solos up to four-man tandems.</ref>\n\nRolls graduated from Cambridge in 1898 and began working on the [[steam yacht]] ''Santa Maria'' followed by a position at the [[London and North Western Railway]] in [[Crewe]].<ref name=\"The_Magic_Of_A_Name\"/> However, his talents lay more in salesmanship and motoring pioneering than practical engineering; in January 1903, with the help of \u00a36,600 provided by his father, he started one of Britain's first car dealerships,<ref name=\"BBC\" /> C. S. Rolls & Co. based in [[Fulham]], to import and sell French [[Peugeot]] and Belgian [[Minerva (automobile)|Minerva]] vehicles.\n<!--Rolls was a tall man, standing at about 1.95 m (6'5\"). no citation, unable to verify-->\n\n==Partnership with Royce==\n[[File:Panhard & Levassor autocar, C S Rolls driver and George V.jpg|thumb|right|235px|C. S. Rolls driving [[George V of the United Kingdom|the Duke of York]] accompanied by Sir Charles Cust and Rolls' father, Lord Llangattock, at 'The Hendre', 1900]]\n{{Main|Rolls-Royce Limited}}\n\nRolls was introduced to [[Henry Royce]] by a friend at the [[Royal Automobile Club]], Henry Edmunds, who was also a director of Royce Ltd. Edmunds showed him Royce's car and arranged the historic meeting between Rolls and Royce at the [[Midland Hotel (Manchester)|Midland Hotel]], Manchester, on 4 May 1904. In spite of his preference for three or four cylinder cars, Rolls was impressed with the two-cylinder Royce 10 and in a subsequent agreement of 23 December 1904 agreed to take all the cars Royce could make. These would be of two, three, four and six cylinders and would be badged as Rolls-Royces.\n\n[[File:CharlesRolls.jpg|thumb|left|123px|Bronze bust at [[Derby Industrial Museum]]]]\nThe first Rolls-Royce car, the [[Rolls-Royce 10 hp]], was unveiled at the [[Paris Motor Show|Paris Salon]] in December 1904, although in the early advertising it was the name of Rolls that was emphasised over that of Royce. In 1906 Rolls and Royce formalised their partnership by creating Rolls-Royce Limited, with Rolls appointed Technical managing director on a salary of \u00a3750 per annum plus 4% of the profits in excess of \u00a310,000. Rolls provided the financial backing and business acumen to complement Royce's technical expertise. In 1907 Rolls-Royce Limited bought out C. S. Rolls & Co.\n\nRolls put much effort into publicising the quietness and smoothness of the Rolls-Royce, and at the end of 1906 travelled to the US to promote the new cars. The company was winning awards for the quality and reliability of its cars by 1907. But by 1909 Rolls' interest in the business was waning, and at the end of the year he resigned as Technical managing director and became a [[non-executive director]].<ref name=\"The_Magic_Of_A_Name\"/>\n\n[[File:The late C.S.

In 1903 he won the [[James Gordon Bennett Jr.|Gordon Bennett]] Gold Medal for the longest single flight time.\n\nBy 1907 Rolls' interest turned increasingly to flying and he tried to persuade Royce to design an aero engine. He became the second Englishman to go up in an aeroplane.

Freeway Kids ===\nOne of Los Angeles' most iconic murals and most notable artwork of Glenna Avila's is the ''L.A. Freeway Kids'' completed in 1984. Located on the Hollywood 101 South freeway, the ''L.A. Freeway Kids'' mural is one of the ten commissioned murals to celebrate the 1984 Olympics held in Los Angeles as well as youth, athletics, and cultural diversity.<ref name=\":1\" /> According to Avila, she envisioned the mural to hold a significant meaning about diversity and childhood, while incorporating youth athletics since children were not part of the Olympics.<ref name=\":0\" /> She wanted to show the kind of potential kids can have in athletics. The mural is 250 feet long and 25 feet tall, consisting of seven children between 18 and 22 feet tall.<ref name=\":1\" /> Each child comes from different racial backgrounds including Hispanic, Asian, Caucasian, and African-American, which communicates the diversity in Los Angeles.

There are seven children including four boys, one who is named Gabriel the basketball child, and three girls named Jennifer, Yuriko, and Misty, who are all shown as physically active. Since Avila wanted to incorporate children and their participation in athletics, the mural inspires everyone to be physically active, even if they are not part of the Olympics, and gives the message that everybody has the opportunity to participate in athletics whether you are an elder or a young child. The mural represents everybody, not just Los Angeles, but different cultural backgrounds from around the world.

For example, the [[gray wolf]]'s scientific name is {{nowrap|''{{lang|la|Canis lupus}}'',}} with ''[[Canis]]'' (Lat. \"dog\") being the generic name shared by the wolf's close relatives and ''lupus'' (Lat. \"wolf\") being the specific name particular to the wolf. A botanical example would be ''[[Hibiscus arnottianus]]'', a particular species of the genus ''[[Hibiscus]]'' native to Hawaii. The specific name is written in lower-case and may be followed by [[subspecies]] names in [[zoology]] or a variety of [[Infraspecific name (botany)|infraspecific names]] in [[botany]]. \n\nWhen the generic name is already known from [[Context (language use)|context]], it may be shortened to its initial letter, for example ''C. lupus'' in place of ''Canis lupus''. Where species are further subdivided, the generic name (or its abbreviated form) still forms the leading portion of the scientific name, for example, {{nowrap|''{{lang|la|Canis lupus familiaris}}''}} for the domestic dog (when considered a subspecies of the gray wolf) in zoology, or as a botanical example, {{nowrap|''{{lang|la|Hibiscus arnottianus}}'' ssp. ''{{lang|la|immaculatus}}''}}. Also, as visible in the above examples, the Latinised portions of the scientific names of genera and their included species (and infraspecies, where applicable) are, by convention, written in [[Italic type|italics]].\n\nThe scientific names of [[virus]] species are descriptive, not binomial in form, and may or may not incorporate an indication of their containing genus; for example, the virus species \"Salmonid herpesvirus 1\", \"Salmonid herpesvirus 2\" and \"Salmonid herpesvirus 3\" are all within the genus ''[[Salmonivirus]]'', however, the genus to which the species with the formal names \"[[Everglades virus]]\" and \"[[Ross River virus]]\" are assigned is ''[[Alphavirus]]''.\n\nAs with scientific names at other ranks, in all groups other than viruses, names of genera may be cited with their authorities, typically in the form \"author, year\" in zoology, and \"standard abbreviated author name\" in botany. Thus in the examples above, the genus ''Canis'' would be cited in full as \"''Canis'' Linnaeus, 1758\" (zoological usage), while ''Hibiscus'', also first established by [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]] but in 1753, is simply \"''Hibiscus'' L.\" (botanical usage).\n\n=== The type concept===\n{{see also|Type genus|Type species|Type specimen}}\nEach genus should have a designated [[type (biology)|type]], although in practice there is a backlog of older names without one. In zoology, this is the [[type species]] and the generic name is permanently associated with the [[type specimen]] of its type species. Should the specimen turn out to be assignable to another genus, the generic name linked to it becomes a [[junior synonym]] and the remaining [[taxon|taxa]] in the former genus need to be reassessed.\n\n===Categories of generic name===\nIn zoological usage, taxonomic names, including those of genera, are classified as \"[[available name|available]]\" or \"unavailable\". Available names are those published in accordance with the [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]] and not otherwise suppressed by subsequent decisions of the [[International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature]] (ICZN); the earliest such name for any taxon (for example, a genus) should then be selected as the \"[[valid name (zoology)|valid]]\" (i.e., current or accepted) name for the taxon in question. \n\nConsequently, there will be more available names than valid names at any point in time, which names are currently in use depending on the judgement of taxonomists in either combining taxa described under multiple names, or splitting taxa which may bring available names previously treated as synonyms back into use. \"Unavailable\" names in zoology comprise names that either were not published according to the provisions of the ICZN Code, or have subsequently been suppressed, e.g., incorrect original or subsequent spellings, names published only in a thesis, and generic names published after 1930 with no type species indicated.<ref name=\"Hawksworth2010\">{{cite book|author=D.

The botanical equivalent of zoology's \"available name\" is a [[validly published name]]. An invalidly published name is a ''nomen invalidum'' or ''nom. inval.''; a rejected name is a ''nomen rejiciendum'' or ''nom. rej.''; a later homonym of a validly published name is a ''nomen illegitimum'' or ''nom. illeg.''; for a full list refer the [[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]] (ICNafp) and the work cited above by Hawksworth, 2010.<ref name=\"Hawksworth2010\" /> In place of the \"valid taxon\" in zoology, the nearest equivalent in botany is \"[[correct name]]\" or \"current name\" which can, again, differ or change with alternative taxonomic treatments or new information that results in previously accepted genera being combined or split.\n\n[[International Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes|Prokaryote]] and [[International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses|virus]] Codes of Nomenclature also exist which serve as a reference for designating currently accepted genus names as opposed to others which may be either reduced to synonymy, or, in the case of prokaryotes, relegated to a status of \"names without standing in prokaryotic nomenclature\".\n\nAn '''available''' (zoological) or '''validly published''' (botanical) name that has been historically applied to a genus but is not regarded as the accepted (current/valid) name for the taxon is termed a '''[[synonym (taxonomy)|synonym]]'''; some authors also include unavailable names in lists of synonyms as well as available names, such as misspellings, names previously published without fulfilling all of the requirements of the relevant nomenclatural Code, and rejected or suppressed names. \n\nA particular genus name may have zero to many synonyms, the latter case generally if the genus has been known for a long time and redescribed as new by a range of subsequent workers, or if a range of genera previously considered separate taxa have subsequently been consolidated into one. For example, the [[World Register of Marine Species]] presently lists 8 genus-level synonyms for the sperm whale genus ''[[Physeter]]'' Linnaeus, 1758,<ref>[http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id=137032 World Register of Marine Species: ''Physeter'' Linnaeus, 1758 ]</ref> and 13 for the bivalve genus ''[[Pecten (bivalve)|Pecten]]'' O.F. M\u00fcller, 1776.<ref>[http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id=138323 World Register of Marine Species: ''Pecten'' O. F. M\u00fcller, 1776]</ref>\n\n===Identical names (homonyms)===\nWithin the same kingdom, one generic name can apply to one genus only.  However, many names have been assigned (usually unintentionally) to two or more different genera. For example, the [[platypus]] belongs to the genus ''Ornithorhynchus'' although [[George Shaw]] named it ''Platypus'' in 1799 (these two names are thus '''''synonyms'')'''. However, the name ''Platypus'' had already been given to a group of [[ambrosia beetle]]s by [[Johann Friedrich Wilhelm Herbst]] in 1793. A name that means two different things is a '''''homonym'''''. Since beetles and platypuses are both members of the kingdom Animalia, the name could not be used for both. [[Johann Friedrich Blumenbach]] published the replacement name ''Ornithorhynchus'' in 1800.\n\nHowever, a genus in one [[kingdom (biology)|kingdom]] is allowed to bear a scientific name that is in use as a generic name (or the name of a taxon in another rank) in a kingdom that is governed by a different nomenclature code. Names with the same form but applying to different taxa are called \"homonyms\". Although this is discouraged by both the [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]] and the [[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]], there are some five thousand such names in use in more than one kingdom. For instance, \n* ''[[Anura (frog)|Anura]]'' is the name of the [[order (biology)|order]] of [[frog]]s but also is the name of a [[synonym (botany)|non-current]] genus of plants; \n* ''Aotus'' is the generic name of both [[Aotus (pea)|golden peas]] and [[night monkey]]s; \n* ''Oenanthe'' is the generic name of both [[wheatear]]s and [[water dropwort]]s; \n* ''Prunella'' is the generic name of both [[accentor]]s and [[self-heal]]; and \n* ''Proboscidea'' is the order of [[elephant]]s and the genus of [[Proboscidea (plant)|devil's claws]].\n* The name of the genus ''[[Paramecia (alga)|Paramecia]]'' (an extinct red alga) is also the plural of the name of the genus ''[[Paramecium]]'' (which is in the SAR supergroup), which can also lead to confusion.\nA list of generic homonyms (with their authorities), including both available (validly published) and selected unavailable names, has been compiled by the [[Interim Register of Marine and Nonmarine Genera]] (IRMNG).<ref name =\"IRMNG\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.irmng.org/homonyms.php|title=IRMNG: Interim Register of Marine and Nonmarine Genera|website=www.irmng.org|access-date=2016-11-17}}</ref>\n\n===Use in higher classifications===\nThe [[type genus]] forms the base for higher [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] ranks, such as the family name {{lang|la|[[Canidae]]}} (\"Canids\") based on ''Canis''. However, this does not typically ascend more than one or two levels: the [[order (biology)|order]] to which dogs and wolves belong is {{lang|la|[[Carnivora]]}} (\"Carnivores\").\n\n==Numbers of accepted genera==\nThe numbers of either accepted, or all published genus names is not known precisely; Rees et al., 2020 estimate that approximately 310,000 accepted names (valid taxa) may exist, out of a total of c. 520,000 published names (including synonyms) as at end 2019, increasing at some 2,500 published generic names per year.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Rees|first=Tony |last2=Vandepitte |first2=Leen |last3=Vanhoorne |first3=Bart |last4=Decock |first4=Wim |title=All genera of the world: an overview and estimates based on the March 2020 release of the Interim Register of Marine and Nonmarine Genera (IRMNG) |journal=Megataxa |volume=1 |pages=123-140 |year=2020 |url=https://www.mapress.com/j/mt/article/view/megataxa.1.2.3/39250 |doi=10.11646/megataxa.1.2.3|doi-access=free }}</ref>  \"Official\" registers of taxon names at all ranks, including genera, exist for a few groups only such as viruses<ref name = \"ICTV\" /> and prokaryotes,<ref>[http://www.bacterio.net/ List of Prokaryotic names with Standing in Nomenclature]</ref> while for others there are compendia with no \"official\" standing such as ''Index Fungorum'' for Fungi,<ref>[http://www.indexfungorum.org/ ''Index Fungorum'']</ref> ''Index Nominum Algarum''<ref>[http://ucjeps.berkeley.edu/ina/ ''Index Nominum Algarum'']</ref> and AlgaeBase<ref>[http://www.algaebase.org/ AlgaeBase]</ref> for algae, ''Index Nominum Genericorum''<ref>[http://botany.si.edu/ing/ ''Index Nominum Genericorum'']</ref> and the International Plant Names Index<ref>[http://www.ipni.org/ The International Plant Names Index]</ref> for plants in general, and ferns through angiosperms, respectively, and ''[[Nomenclator Zoologicus]]''<ref>[http://ubio.org/NomenclatorZoologicus/ ''Nomenclator Zoologicus'']</ref> and the [[Index to Organism Names]] (http://www.organismnames.com/) for zoological names.\n\nTotals for both \"all names\" and estimates for \"accepted names\" as held in the ''[[Interim Register of Marine and Nonmarine Genera]]'' (IRMNG) are broken down further in the publication by Rees et al., 2020 cited above. The accepted names estimates are as follows, broken down by kingdom:\n[[File:Estimated accepted genus totals by kingdom - based on Rees et al 2020.jpg|thumb|Estimated accepted genus totals by kingdom - based on Rees et al., 2020]]\n* [[Animalia]]: 239,093 accepted genus names (\u00b1 55,350)\n* [[Plantae]]: 28,724 accepted genus names (\u00b1 7,721)\n* [[Fungi]]: 10,468 accepted genus names (\u00b1 182)\n* [[Chromista]]: 11,114 accepted genus names (\u00b1 1,268)\n* [[Protozoa]]: 3,109 accepted genus names (\u00b1 1,206)\n* [[Bacteria]]: 3,433 accepted genus names (\u00b1 115)\n* [[Archaea]]: 140 accepted genus names (\u00b1 0)\n* [[Virus]]es: 851 accepted genus names (\u00b1 0)\n\nThe cited ranges of uncertainty arise because IRMNG lists \"uncertain\" names (not researched therein) in addition to known \"accepted\" names; the values quoted are the mean of \"accepted\" names alone (all \"uncertain\" names treated as unaccepted) and \"accepted + uncertain\" names (all \"uncertain\" names treated as accepted), with the associated range of uncertainty indicating these two extremes.\n\nWithin Animalia, the largest phylum is [[Arthropoda]], with 151,697 \u00b1 33,160 accepted genus names, of which 114,387 \u00b1 27,654 are [[insects]] (class Insecta). Within Plantae, [[Tracheophya]] (vascular plants) make up the largest component, with 23,236 \u00b1 5,379 accepted genus names, of which 20,845 \u00b1 4,494 are [[angiosperms]] (superclass Angiospermae).\n\nBy comparison, the 2018 annual edition of the [[Catalogue of Life]] (estimated >90% complete, for extant species in the main) contains currently 175,363 \"accepted\" genus names for 1,744,204 living and 59,284 extinct species,<ref>[http://www.catalogueoflife.org/annual-checklist/2018/info/ac Information: Catalogue of Life: 2018 Annual Checklist]</ref> also including genus names only (no species) for some groups.\n\n==Genus size==\n[[File:Number of reptile genera with a given number of species.png|thumb|upright=1.35|Number of reptile genera with a given number of species.

For instance, among (non-avian) [[reptile]]s, which have about 1180 genera, the most (>300) have only 1 species, ~360 have between 2 and 4 species, 260 have 5-10 species, ~200 have 11-50 species, and only 27 genera have more than 50 species (see figure).<ref>[[The Reptile Database]]</ref> However, some insect genera such as the bee genera ''[[Lasioglossum]]'' and ''[[Andrena]]'' have over 1000 species each.

Although all species within a genus are supposed to be \"similar\" there are no objective criteria for grouping species into genera. There is much debate among zoologists whether large, species-rich genera should be maintained, as it is extremely difficult to come up with identification keys or even character sets that distinguish all species. Hence, many taxonomists argue in favor of breaking down large genera. For instance, the lizard genus ''[[Anolis]]'' has been suggested to be broken down into 8 or so different genera which would bring its ~400 species to smaller, more manageable subsets.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Nicholson|first1=K.

It plays a fundamental role in [[binomial nomenclature]], the system of naming [[organisms]], where it is combined with the scientific name of a [[species]]: see [[Specific name (botany)]] and [[Specific name (zoology)]].\n\n=== Use in nomenclature ===\n{{Main|Binomial nomenclature|Taxonomy (biology)|Author citation (zoology)|Author citation (botany)}}\nThe rules for the [[scientific name]]s of [[organisms]] are laid down in the [[Nomenclature Codes]], which allow each species a single unique name that, for \"[[animals]]\" (including [[protists]]), \"[[plants]]\" (also including [[algae]] and [[fungi]]) and [[prokaryotes]] ([[Bacteria]] and [[Archaea]]), is [[Latin]] and binomial in form; this contrasts with [[common name|common]] or [[vernacular]] names, which are non-standardized, can be non-unique, and typically also vary by country and language of usage. \n\nExcept for [[Virus classification|viruses]], the standard format for a [[species]] name comprises the generic name, indicating the genus to which the species belongs, followed by the specific epithet, which (within that genus) is unique to the species. For example, the [[gray wolf]]'s scientific name is {{nowrap|''{{lang|la|Canis lupus}}'',}} with ''[[Canis]]'' (Lat. \"dog\") being the generic name shared by the wolf's close relatives and ''lupus'' (Lat. \"wolf\") being the specific name particular to the wolf. A botanical example would be ''[[Hibiscus arnottianus]]'', a particular species of the genus ''[[Hibiscus]]'' native to Hawaii. The specific name is written in lower-case and may be followed by [[subspecies]] names in [[zoology]] or a variety of [[Infraspecific name (botany)|infraspecific names]] in [[botany]]. \n\nWhen the generic name is already known from [[Context (language use)|context]], it may be shortened to its initial letter, for example ''C. lupus'' in place of ''Canis lupus''. Where species are further subdivided, the generic name (or its abbreviated form) still forms the leading portion of the scientific name, for example, {{nowrap|''{{lang|la|Canis lupus familiaris}}''}} for the domestic dog (when considered a subspecies of the gray wolf) in zoology, or as a botanical example, {{nowrap|''{{lang|la|Hibiscus arnottianus}}'' ssp. ''{{lang|la|immaculatus}}''}}. Also, as visible in the above examples, the Latinised portions of the scientific names of genera and their included species (and infraspecies, where applicable) are, by convention, written in [[Italic type|italics]].\n\nThe scientific names of [[virus]] species are descriptive, not binomial in form, and may or may not incorporate an indication of their containing genus; for example, the virus species \"Salmonid herpesvirus 1\", \"Salmonid herpesvirus 2\" and \"Salmonid herpesvirus 3\" are all within the genus ''[[Salmonivirus]]'', however, the genus to which the species with the formal names \"[[Everglades virus]]\" and \"[[Ross River virus]]\" are assigned is ''[[Alphavirus]]''.\n\nAs with scientific names at other ranks, in all groups other than viruses, names of genera may be cited with their authorities, typically in the form \"author, year\" in zoology, and \"standard abbreviated author name\" in botany. Thus in the examples above, the genus ''Canis'' would be cited in full as \"''Canis'' Linnaeus, 1758\" (zoological usage), while ''Hibiscus'', also first established by [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]] but in 1753, is simply \"''Hibiscus'' L.\" (botanical usage).\n\n=== The type concept===\n{{see also|Type genus|Type species|Type specimen}}\nEach genus should have a designated [[type (biology)|type]], although in practice there is a backlog of older names without one.

An invalidly published name is a ''nomen invalidum'' or ''nom. inval.''; a rejected name is a ''nomen rejiciendum'' or ''nom. rej.''; a later homonym of a validly published name is a ''nomen illegitimum'' or ''nom. illeg.''; for a full list refer the [[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]] (ICNafp) and the work cited above by Hawksworth, 2010.<ref name=\"Hawksworth2010\" /> In place of the \"valid taxon\" in zoology, the nearest equivalent in botany is \"[[correct name]]\" or \"current name\" which can, again, differ or change with alternative taxonomic treatments or new information that results in previously accepted genera being combined or split.\n\n[[International Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes|Prokaryote]] and [[International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses|virus]] Codes of Nomenclature also exist which serve as a reference for designating currently accepted genus names as opposed to others which may be either reduced to synonymy, or, in the case of prokaryotes, relegated to a status of \"names without standing in prokaryotic nomenclature\".\n\nAn '''available''' (zoological) or '''validly published''' (botanical) name that has been historically applied to a genus but is not regarded as the accepted (current/valid) name for the taxon is termed a '''[[synonym (taxonomy)|synonym]]'''; some authors also include unavailable names in lists of synonyms as well as available names, such as misspellings, names previously published without fulfilling all of the requirements of the relevant nomenclatural Code, and rejected or suppressed names. \n\nA particular genus name may have zero to many synonyms, the latter case generally if the genus has been known for a long time and redescribed as new by a range of subsequent workers, or if a range of genera previously considered separate taxa have subsequently been consolidated into one. For example, the [[World Register of Marine Species]] presently lists 8 genus-level synonyms for the sperm whale genus ''[[Physeter]]'' Linnaeus, 1758,<ref>[http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id=137032 World Register of Marine Species: ''Physeter'' Linnaeus, 1758 ]</ref> and 13 for the bivalve genus ''[[Pecten (bivalve)|Pecten]]'' O.F. M\u00fcller, 1776.<ref>[http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id=138323 World Register of Marine Species: ''Pecten'' O. F. M\u00fcller, 1776]</ref>\n\n===Identical names (homonyms)===\nWithin the same kingdom, one generic name can apply to one genus only.  However, many names have been assigned (usually unintentionally) to two or more different genera. For example, the [[platypus]] belongs to the genus ''Ornithorhynchus'' although [[George Shaw]] named it ''Platypus'' in 1799 (these two names are thus '''''synonyms'')'''. However, the name ''Platypus'' had already been given to a group of [[ambrosia beetle]]s by [[Johann Friedrich Wilhelm Herbst]] in 1793. A name that means two different things is a '''''homonym'''''. Since beetles and platypuses are both members of the kingdom Animalia, the name could not be used for both. [[Johann Friedrich Blumenbach]] published the replacement name ''Ornithorhynchus'' in 1800.\n\nHowever, a genus in one [[kingdom (biology)|kingdom]] is allowed to bear a scientific name that is in use as a generic name (or the name of a taxon in another rank) in a kingdom that is governed by a different nomenclature code. Names with the same form but applying to different taxa are called \"homonyms\". Although this is discouraged by both the [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]] and the [[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]], there are some five thousand such names in use in more than one kingdom. For instance, \n* ''[[Anura (frog)|Anura]]'' is the name of the [[order (biology)|order]] of [[frog]]s but also is the name of a [[synonym (botany)|non-current]] genus of plants; \n* ''Aotus'' is the generic name of both [[Aotus (pea)|golden peas]] and [[night monkey]]s; \n* ''Oenanthe'' is the generic name of both [[wheatear]]s and [[water dropwort]]s; \n* ''Prunella'' is the generic name of both [[accentor]]s and [[self-heal]]; and \n* ''Proboscidea'' is the order of [[elephant]]s and the genus of [[Proboscidea (plant)|devil's claws]].\n* The name of the genus ''[[Paramecia (alga)|Paramecia]]'' (an extinct red alga) is also the plural of the name of the genus ''[[Paramecium]]'' (which is in the SAR supergroup), which can also lead to confusion.\nA list of generic homonyms (with their authorities), including both available (validly published) and selected unavailable names, has been compiled by the [[Interim Register of Marine and Nonmarine Genera]] (IRMNG).<ref name =\"IRMNG\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.irmng.org/homonyms.php|title=IRMNG: Interim Register of Marine and Nonmarine Genera|website=www.irmng.org|access-date=2016-11-17}}</ref>\n\n===Use in higher classifications===\nThe [[type genus]] forms the base for higher [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] ranks, such as the family name {{lang|la|[[Canidae]]}} (\"Canids\") based on ''Canis''. However, this does not typically ascend more than one or two levels: the [[order (biology)|order]] to which dogs and wolves belong is {{lang|la|[[Carnivora]]}} (\"Carnivores\").\n\n==Numbers of accepted genera==\nThe numbers of either accepted, or all published genus names is not known precisely; Rees et al., 2020 estimate that approximately 310,000 accepted names (valid taxa) may exist, out of a total of c. 520,000 published names (including synonyms) as at end 2019, increasing at some 2,500 published generic names per year.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Rees|first=Tony |last2=Vandepitte |first2=Leen |last3=Vanhoorne |first3=Bart |last4=Decock |first4=Wim |title=All genera of the world: an overview and estimates based on the March 2020 release of the Interim Register of Marine and Nonmarine Genera (IRMNG) |journal=Megataxa |volume=1 |pages=123-140 |year=2020 |url=https://www.mapress.com/j/mt/article/view/megataxa.1.2.3/39250 |doi=10.11646/megataxa.1.2.3|doi-access=free }}</ref>  \"Official\" registers of taxon names at all ranks, including genera, exist for a few groups only such as viruses<ref name = \"ICTV\" /> and prokaryotes,<ref>[http://www.bacterio.net/ List of Prokaryotic names with Standing in Nomenclature]</ref> while for others there are compendia with no \"official\" standing such as ''Index Fungorum'' for Fungi,<ref>[http://www.indexfungorum.org/ ''Index Fungorum'']</ref> ''Index Nominum Algarum''<ref>[http://ucjeps.berkeley.edu/ina/ ''Index Nominum Algarum'']</ref> and AlgaeBase<ref>[http://www.algaebase.org/ AlgaeBase]</ref> for algae, ''Index Nominum Genericorum''<ref>[http://botany.si.edu/ing/ ''Index Nominum Genericorum'']</ref> and the International Plant Names Index<ref>[http://www.ipni.org/ The International Plant Names Index]</ref> for plants in general, and ferns through angiosperms, respectively, and ''[[Nomenclator Zoologicus]]''<ref>[http://ubio.org/NomenclatorZoologicus/ ''Nomenclator Zoologicus'']</ref> and the [[Index to Organism Names]] (http://www.organismnames.com/) for zoological names.\n\nTotals for both \"all names\" and estimates for \"accepted names\" as held in the ''[[Interim Register of Marine and Nonmarine Genera]]'' (IRMNG) are broken down further in the publication by Rees et al., 2020 cited above. The accepted names estimates are as follows, broken down by kingdom:\n[[File:Estimated accepted genus totals by kingdom - based on Rees et al 2020.jpg|thumb|Estimated accepted genus totals by kingdom - based on Rees et al., 2020]]\n* [[Animalia]]: 239,093 accepted genus names (\u00b1 55,350)\n* [[Plantae]]: 28,724 accepted genus names (\u00b1 7,721)\n* [[Fungi]]: 10,468 accepted genus names (\u00b1 182)\n* [[Chromista]]: 11,114 accepted genus names (\u00b1 1,268)\n* [[Protozoa]]: 3,109 accepted genus names (\u00b1 1,206)\n* [[Bacteria]]: 3,433 accepted genus names (\u00b1 115)\n* [[Archaea]]: 140 accepted genus names (\u00b1 0)\n* [[Virus]]es: 851 accepted genus names (\u00b1 0)\n\nThe cited ranges of uncertainty arise because IRMNG lists \"uncertain\" names (not researched therein) in addition to known \"accepted\" names; the values quoted are the mean of \"accepted\" names alone (all \"uncertain\" names treated as unaccepted) and \"accepted + uncertain\" names (all \"uncertain\" names treated as accepted), with the associated range of uncertainty indicating these two extremes.\n\nWithin Animalia, the largest phylum is [[Arthropoda]], with 151,697 \u00b1 33,160 accepted genus names, of which 114,387 \u00b1 27,654 are [[insects]] (class Insecta). Within Plantae, [[Tracheophya]] (vascular plants) make up the largest component, with 23,236 \u00b1 5,379 accepted genus names, of which 20,845 \u00b1 4,494 are [[angiosperms]] (superclass Angiospermae).\n\nBy comparison, the 2018 annual edition of the [[Catalogue of Life]] (estimated >90% complete, for extant species in the main) contains currently 175,363 \"accepted\" genus names for 1,744,204 living and 59,284 extinct species,<ref>[http://www.catalogueoflife.org/annual-checklist/2018/info/ac Information: Catalogue of Life: 2018 Annual Checklist]</ref> also including genus names only (no species) for some groups.\n\n==Genus size==\n[[File:Number of reptile genera with a given number of species.png|thumb|upright=1.35|Number of reptile genera with a given number of species. Most genera have only one or a few species but a few may have hundreds. Based on data from the [[Reptile Database]] (as of May 2015).]]\n\nThe number of species in genera varies considerably among taxonomic groups. For instance, among (non-avian) [[reptile]]s, which have about 1180 genera, the most (>300) have only 1 species, ~360 have between 2 and 4 species, 260 have 5-10 species, ~200 have 11-50 species, and only 27 genera have more than 50 species (see figure).<ref>[[The Reptile Database]]</ref> However, some insect genera such as the bee genera ''[[Lasioglossum]]'' and ''[[Andrena]]'' have over 1000 species each. The largest flowering plant genus, ''[[Astragalus]]'', contains over 3,000 species.<ref name=\"Frodin\">{{cite journal |last=Frodin |first=David G. |year=2004 |title=History and concepts of big plant genera |journal=[[Taxon (journal)|Taxon]] |volume=53 |issue=3 |pages=753\u2013776 |jstor=4135449 |doi=10.2307/4135449}}</ref>\n\nWhich species are assigned to a genus is somewhat arbitrary. Although all species within a genus are supposed to be \"similar\" there are no objective criteria for grouping species into genera. There is much debate among zoologists whether large, species-rich genera should be maintained, as it is extremely difficult to come up with identification keys or even character sets that distinguish all species. Hence, many taxonomists argue in favor of breaking down large genera. For instance, the lizard genus ''[[Anolis]]'' has been suggested to be broken down into 8 or so different genera which would bring its ~400 species to smaller, more manageable subsets.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Nicholson|first1=K.

[[Prehistoric Egypt|Predynastic Egypt]], scholars believe the importance of the physical body and its preservation originated there. This would explain why people of that time did not follow the common practice of cremation but rather buried the dead. Some also believe they may have feared the bodies would rise again if mistreated after death.<ref>[[Fran\u00e7oise Dunand]] and Roger Lichtenberg, Mummies and Death in Egypt, (London: [[Cornell University|Cornell University Press]], 2006), p. 9</ref>\n\nEarly bodies were buried in simple, shallow oval pits, with a few burial goods. Sometimes multiple people and animals were placed in the same grave. Over time, graves became more complex, with the body placed in a wicker basket, then later in wooden or [[terracotta]] coffins. The latest tombs Egyptians made were sarcophagi. These graves contained burial goods like jewelry, food, games and sharpened splint.<ref>Fran\u00e7oise Dunand and Roger Lichtenberg, Mummies and Death in Egypt, (London: Cornell University Press, 2006), p. 7</ref>\n\nThis demonstrates that this ancient period had a sense of the afterlife, though archaeological evidence may show the average person had little chance of getting into it. This may be because admission required that the deceased must be able to serve a purpose there. The [[pharaoh]] was allowed in because of his role in life, and others needed to have some role there.\n\n[[Ancient Egyptian retainer sacrifices|Human sacrifice]]s found in early royal tombs reinforce this view. Those sacrificed were probably meant to serve the pharaoh in his afterlife. Eventually, [[Ushabti|figurines]] and wall paintings begin to replace human victims.<ref>Sergio Donadoni, ''The Egyptians'', (Chicago: [[University of Chicago Press]], 1997) p. 262</ref> Some of these figurines may have been created to resemble certain people, so they could follow the pharaoh after their lives ended.\n\nNote that not only the [[Social class|lower classes]] had to rely on the pharaoh's favor, but also the noble classes. They believed that when he died, the pharaoh became some sort of god, who could bestow upon certain individuals the ability to have an afterlife. This belief existed from the predynastic period through the [[Old Kingdom]].\n\nAlthough many spells from the predeceasing texts were carried over, the new coffin texts also had additional new spells added, along with slight changes made to make this new [[funerary text]] more relatable to the nobility.<ref name=\" Erik Hornung\"/> In the [[First Intermediate Period of Egypt|First Intermediate Period]], however, the importance of the pharaoh declined. Funerary texts, previously restricted to royal use, became more widely available. The pharaoh was no longer a [[god-king]] in the sense that only he was allowed in the next life due to his status here, now he was merely the ruler of the population who upon his death would be leveled down towards the plane of the mortals.<ref>John A. Wilson, The Culture of Ancient Egypt, (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1965), p. 116.</ref>\n\n===Prehistory, earliest burials===\nThe first funerals in Egypt are known from the villages of Omari and [[Maadi]] in the north, near present-day [[Cairo]]. The people of these villages buried their dead in a simple, round grave with a pot. The body was neither treated nor arranged in a regular way as would be the case later in the historical period. Without any written evidence, there is little to provide information about contemporary beliefs concerning the afterlife except for the regular inclusion of a single pot in the grave. Given later customs, the pot was probably intended to hold food for the deceased.<ref>{{cite book|last1=[[Edward Bleiberg|Bleiberg]]|first1=Edward|title=To Live Forever: Egyptian Treasure from the Brooklyn Museum|date=2008|publisher=Brooklyn Museum|location=Brooklyn, NY|page=71}}</ref>\n\n===Predynastic period, development of customs===\nFunerary customs were developed during the [[Prehistoric Egypt|Predynastic period]] from those of the Prehistoric Period. At first, people excavated round graves with one pot in the [[Badari culture|Badarian Period]] (4400-3800 B.C.E.), continuing the tradition of Omari and Maadi cultures. By the end of the Predynastic period, there were increasing numbers of objects deposited with the body in rectangular graves, and there is growing evidence of rituals practiced by Egyptians of the [[Naqada culture|Naquada II Period]] (3650-3300 B.C.E). At this point, bodies were regularly arranged in a crouched or fetal position with the face toward either the east the rising sun or the west (which in this historical period was the land of the dead). Artists painted jars with funeral processions and perhaps ritual dancing. Figures of bare-breasted women with birdlike faces and their legs concealed under skirts also appeared in some graves. Some graves were much richer in goods than others, demonstrating the beginnings of social stratification. Gender differences in burial emerged with the inclusion of weapons in men's graves and cosmetics palettes in women's graves.<ref>{{cite book|last1=[[Edward Bleiberg|Bleiberg]]|first1=Edward|title=To Live Forever: Egyptian Treasure from the Brooklyn Museum|date=2008|publisher=Brooklyn Museum|location=Brooklyn, NY|pages=71\u201372}}</ref>\n\nBy 3,600 BCE, Egyptians had begun to mummify the dead, wrapping them in linen bandages with embalming oils (conifer resin and aromatic plant extracts).<ref>[https://www.livescience.com/63351-mummy-older-than-pharaohs.html Mindy Seisberger, 'This Ancient Mummy Is Older Than the Pharaohs', Live Science, 16 August 2016]</ref><ref>[https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2018/08/news-egyptian-prehistoric-mummy-embalming-recipe/ Maya Wei-Haas,'Mummy yields earliest known Egyptian embalming recipe', National Geographic,15 August 2018] </ref>\n\n===Early Dynastic Period, tombs and coffins===\nBy the [[First Dynasty of Egypt|First Dynasty]], some Egyptians were wealthy enough to build tombs over their burials rather than placing their bodies in simple pit graves dug into the sand. The rectangular, mud-brick tomb with an underground burial chamber, called a [[mastaba]], developed in this period. These tombs had niched walls, a style of building called the palace-fa\u00e7ade motif because the walls imitated those surrounding the palace of the king. Since commoners as well as kings, however, had such tombs, the architecture suggests that in death, some wealthy people did achieve an elevated status. Later in the historical period, it is certain that the deceased was associated with the god of the dead, [[Osiris]].\n\nGrave goods expanded to include furniture, jewelry, and games as well as the weapons, cosmetic palettes, and food supplies in decorated jars known earlier, in the Predynastic period. Now, however, in the richest tombs, grave goods numbered in the thousands. Only the newly invented coffins for the body were made specifically for the tomb. There is also some inconclusive evidence for mummification. Other objects in the tombs that had been used during daily life suggest that Egyptians already in the First Dynasty anticipated needing in the next life. Further continuity from this life into the next can be found in the positioning of tombs: those persons who served the king during their lifetimes chose burials close to their lord. The use of [[stele|stela]] in front of the tomb began in the First Dynasty, indicating a desire to individualize the tomb with the deceased's name.<ref>{{cite book|last1=[[Edward Bleiberg|Bleiberg]]|first1=Edward|title=To Live Forever: Egyptian Treasure from the Brooklyn Museum|date=2008|publisher=Brooklyn Museum|location=Brooklyn, NY|pages=72\u201373}}</ref>\n\n===Old Kingdom, pyramids and mummification===\n[[File: Relief of Men Presenting Oxen, ca. 2500-2350 B.C.E. Limestone.jpg|thumbnail|right|'' Relief of Men Presenting Oxen'', ca. 2500\u20132350 B.C.E. Limestone. In this relief, three men bring cattle to the tomb owner, \"from the towns of the estate,\" as the inscription says. Two of these balding, rustic laborers wear kilts of coarse material and the other wears nothing at all. A fragmentary scene below shows men bringing cranes, which Egyptians penned and raised for food. Artisans carved images of live food animals in tombs to supply the deceased with an eternal source of provisions. [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]\nIn the [[Old Kingdom of Egypt|Old Kingdom]], kings first built pyramids for their tombs surrounded by stone mastaba tombs for their high officials. The fact that most high officials were also royal relatives suggests another motivation for such placement: these complexes were also family cemeteries.\n\nAmong the elite, bodies were mummified, wrapped in linen bandages, sometimes covered with molded plaster, and placed in stone sarcophagi or plain wooden coffins. At the end of the Old Kingdom, mummy masks in [[cartonnage]] (linen soaked in plaster, modeled and painted) also appeared. Canopic containers now held their internal organs. Amulets of gold, [[Egyptian faience|faience]], and [[carnelian]] first appeared in various shapes to protect different parts of the body. There is also the first evidence of inscriptions inside the coffins of the elite during the Old Kingdom. Often, reliefs of everyday items were etched onto the walls supplemented grave goods, which made them available through their representation.\n\nThe new false door was a non-functioning stone sculpture of a door into the tomb, found either inside the chapel or on the outside of the mastaba; it served as a place to make offerings and recite prayers for the deceased. Statues of the deceased were now included in tombs and used for ritual purposes. Burial chambers of some private people received their first decorations in addition to the decoration of the chapels. At the end of the Old Kingdom, the burial chamber decorations depicted offerings, but not people.<ref>{{cite book|last1=[[Edward Bleiberg|Bleiberg]]|first1=Edward|title=To Live Forever: Egyptian Treasure from the Brooklyn Museum|date=2008|publisher=Brooklyn Museum|location=Brooklyn, NY|pages=74\u201377}}</ref>\n\n===First Intermediate Period, regional variation===\nThe political situation in the [[First Intermediate Period of Egypt|First Intermediate Period]], with many centers of power, is reflected in the many local styles of art and burial at this time. The many regional styles for decorating coffins make their origins easy to distinguish from each other. For example, some coffins have one-line inscriptions, and many styles include the depiction of ''Wadjet'' eyes (the human eye with the markings of a falcon). There are also regional variations in the [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphs]] used to decorate coffins.\n\nOccasionally men had tools and weapons in their graves, while some women had jewelry and cosmetic objects such as mirrors. Grindstones were sometimes included in women's tombs, perhaps to be considered a tool for food preparation in the next world, just as the weapons in men's tombs imply men's assignment to a role in fighting.<ref>{{cite book|last1=[[Edward Bleiberg|Bleiberg]]|first1=Edward|title=To Live Forever: Egyptian Treasure from the Brooklyn Museum|date=2008|publisher=Brooklyn Museum|location=Brooklyn, NY|page=77}}</ref>\n\n===Middle Kingdom, new tomb contents===\n[[File:Mask from a Coffin. Cartonnage,37.1387E.jpg|thumbnail|Mask from a coffin. Cartonnage, 37.1387E, [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]\n\nBurial customs in the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] reflect some of the political trends of this period. During the [[Eleventh Dynasty of Egypt|Eleventh Dynasty]], tombs were cut into the mountains of [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] surrounding the king's tomb or in local cemeteries in [[Upper Egypt|Upper]] and [[Middle Egypt]]; Thebes was the native city of the Eleventh Dynasty kings, and they preferred to be buried there. But the [[Twelfth Dynasty of Egypt|Twelfth Dynasty]], high officials served the kings of a new family now ruling from the north in [[Lisht]]; these kings and their high officials preferred burial in a mastaba near the pyramids belonging to their masters. Moreover, the difference in topography between Thebes and Lisht led to a difference in tomb type: in the north, nobles build mastaba tombs on the flat desert plains, while in the south, local dignitaries continued to excavate tombs in the mountain.\n\nFor those of ranks lower than royal courtiers during the Eleventh Dynasty, tombs were simpler. Coffins could be simple wooden boxes with the body either mummified and wrapped in linen or simply wrapped without mummification, and the addition of a cartonnage mummy mask. Some tombs included wooded shoes and a simple statue near the body. In one burial there were only twelve loaves of bread, a leg of beef, and a jar of beer for food offerings. Jewelry could be included but only rarely were objects of great value found in non-elite graves. Some burials continued to include the [[Wooden tomb model|wooden models]] that were popular during the [[First Intermediate Period of Egypt|First Intermediate Period]]. Wooden models of boats, scenes of food production, craftsmen and workshops, and professions such as scribes or soldiers have been found in the tombs of this period.\n\nSome rectangular coffins of the Twelfth Dynasty have short inscriptions and representations of the most important offerings the deceased required. For men, the objects depicted were weapons and symbols of office as well as food. Women's coffins depicted mirrors, sandals, and jars containing food and drink. Some coffins included texts that were later versions of the royal [[Pyramid Texts]].\n\nAnother kind of faience model of the deceased as a mummy seems to anticipate the use of ''[[shabti]]'' figurines (also called ''shawabti'' or an ''ushabti'') later in the Twelfth Dynasty. These early figurines do not have the text directing the figure to work in the place of the deceased that is found in later figurines. The richest people had stone figurines that seem to anticipate ''shabtis'', though some scholars have seen them as mummy substitutes rather than servant figures.\n\nIn the later Twelfth Dynasty, significant changes occurred in burials, perhaps reflecting administrative changes enacted by King [[Senusret III|Senwosret III]] (1836\u20131818 B.C.E.). The body was now regularly placed on its back, rather than its side as had been done for thousands of years. Coffin texts and wooden models disappeared from new tombs of the period while heart scarabs and figurines shaped like mummies were now often included in burials, as they would be for the remainder of Egyptian history. Coffin decoration was simplified. The [[Thirteenth Dynasty of Egypt|Thirteenth Dynasty]] saw another change in decoration. Different motifs were found in the north and south, a reflection of decentralized government power at the time. There was also a marked increase in the number of burials in one tomb, a rare occurrence in earlier periods. The reuse of one tomb by a family over generations seems to have occurred when wealth was more equitably spread.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bleiberg |first1=Edward |author-link=Edward Bleiberg |title=To Live Forever: Egyptian Treasure from the Brooklyn Museum|date=2008|publisher=Brooklyn Museum|location=Brooklyn, NY|pages=77\u201386}}</ref>\n\n===Second Intermediate Period, foreigner burials===\nKnown graves from the [[Second Intermediate Period of Egypt|Second Intermediate Period]] reveal the presence of non-Egyptians buried in the country. In the north, graves associated with the [[Hyksos]], a western [[Semitic people]] ruling the north from the northeast delta, include small mud-brick structures containing the body, pottery vessels, a dagger in a men's graves and often a nearby donkey burial. Simple pan-shaped graves in various parts of the country are thought to belong to [[Nubia]]n soldiers. Such graves reflect very ancient customs and feature shallow, round pits, bodies contracted and minimal food offerings in pots. The occasional inclusion of identifiable Egyptian materials from the Second Intermediate Period provides the only marks distinguishing these burials from those of Predynastic and even earlier periods.<ref>{{cite book |last1=[[Edward Bleiberg|Bleiberg]] |first1=Edward |title=To Live Forever: Egyptian Treasure from the Brooklyn Museum |year=2008 |publisher=Brooklyn Museum |location=Brooklyn, New York|pages=86\u201389}}</ref>\n\n===New Kingdom, new object purposes===\n[[File:S10.08 Deir-El-Bahari, image 9932.jpg|thumbnail|Deir-El-Bahari]]\nThe majority of elite tombs in the [[New Kingdom of Egypt|New Kingdom]] were rock-cut chambers. Kings were buried in multi-roomed, rock-cut tombs in the [[Valley of the Kings]] and no longer in pyramids. Priests conducted funerary rituals for them in stone temples built on the west bank of the [[Nile]] opposite of Thebes. From the current evidence, the [[Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt|Eighteenth Dynasty]] appears to be the last period in which Egyptians regularly included multiple objects from their daily lives in their tombs; beginning in the [[Nineteenth Dynasty of Egypt|Nineteenth Dynasty]], tombs contained fewer items from daily life and included objects made especially for the next world. Thus the change from the Eighteenth to the Nineteenth Dynasties formed a dividing line in burial traditions: The Eighteenth Dynasty more closely remembered the immediate past in its customs whereas the Nineteenth Dynasty anticipated the customs of the [[Late Period of ancient Egypt|Late Period]].\n\n[[File: Tutankhamun's bed (Cairo Museum).jpg|thumb|Gilded bier fashioned to resemble the goddess [[Sekhmet]], the fierce protector of the kings in life and death, from the tomb of [[Tutankhamun]], Cairo Museum]] \nPeople of the elite ranks in the Eighteenth Dynasty placed furniture as well as clothing and other items in their tombs, objects they undoubtedly used during life on earth. Beds, headrests, chairs, stools, leather sandals, jewelry, musical instruments, and wooden storage chests were present in these tombs. While all of the objects listed were for the elite, many poor people did not put anything beyond weapons and cosmetics into their tombs.\n\nNo elite tombs survive unplundered from the [[New Kingdom of Egypt|Ramesside period]]. In this period, artists decorated tombs belonging to the elite with more scene of religious events, rather than the everyday scene that had been popular since the Old Kingdom. The funeral itself, the funerary meal with multiple relatives, the worshipping of the gods, even figures in the underworld were subjects in elite tomb decorations. The majority of objects found in the Ramesside period tombs were made for the afterlife. Aside from the jewelry, which could have been used also during life, objects in Ramesside tombs were manufactured for the next world.<ref>{{cite book |last1=[[Edward Bleiberg|Bleiberg]] |first1=Edward |title=To Live Forever: Egyptian Treasure from the Brooklyn Museum |year=2008 |publisher=Brooklyn Museum |location=Brooklyn, New York |pages=89\u2013100}}</ref>\n\n===Third Intermediate Period===\n[[File: Funerary Figurine of King Pinudjem I, ca. 1025-1007 B.C.E., 16.190.jpg|thumbnail|Shabties of King Pinudjem I, ca. 1025\u20131007 B.C.E., 16.190, [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]\nAlthough the political structure of the New Kingdom collapsed at the end of the [[Twentieth Dynasty of Egypt|Twentieth Dynasty]], the majority of burials in the [[Twenty-first Dynasty of Egypt|Twenty-first Dynasty]] directly reflect developments from the earlier period. At the beginning of this time, reliefs resembled those from the Ramesside period. Only at the very end of the [[Third Intermediate Period of Egypt|Third Intermediate Period]] did new funerary practices of the Late Period begin to be seen.\n\nLittle is known of tombs from this period. The very lack of decorations in tombs seems to have led to much more elaborate decoration of coffins. The remaining grave goods of the period show fairly cheaply made ''shabties'', even when the owner was a queen or a princess.<ref>{{cite book|last1=[[Edward Bleiberg|Bleiberg]]|first1=Edward|title=To Live Forever: Egyptian Treasure from the Brooklyn Museum|date=2008|publisher=Brooklyn Museum|location=Brooklyn, NY|pages=100\u2013103}}</ref>\n\n===Late Period, monumentality and return to traditions===\nBurials in the [[Late Period of ancient Egypt|Late Period]] could make use of large-scale, temple-like tombs built for the non-royal elite for the first time. But the majority of tombs in this period were in shafts sunk into the desert floor. In addition to fine statuary and reliefs reflecting the style of the Old Kingdom, the majority of grave goods were specially made for the tomb. Coffins continued to bear religious texts and scenes. Some shafts were personalized by the use of stela with the deceased prayers and name on it. ''Shabties'' in faience for all classes are known. Canopic jars, though often nonfunctional, continued to be included. Staves and scepters representing the deceased's office in life were often present as well. A figure of either the god Osiris or of the composite deity Ptah-Sokar-Osiris could be found, along with heart scarabs, both gold and faience examples of djed-columns, [[Eye of Horus]] amulets, figures of gods, and images of the deceased's ''ba''. Tools for the tomb's ritual called the \"[[Opening of the mouth ceremony|opening of the mouth]]\" as well as \"magical bricks\" at the four compass points could be included.<ref>{{cite book |last1=[[Edward Bleiberg|Bleiberg]] |first1=Edward |title=To Live Forever: Egyptian Treasure from the Brooklyn Museum |year=2008 |publisher=Brooklyn Museum |location=Brooklyn, New York |page=103}}</ref>\n\n===Ptolemaic period, Hellenistic influences===\nFollowing Egypt's conquest by [[Alexander the Great]], the country was ruled by the descendants of [[Ptolemy I Soter|Ptolemy]], one of his generals. The Macedonian Greek family fostered a culture that promoted both [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] and ancient Egyptian ways of life: while many Greek-speaking people living in [[Alexandria]] followed the customs of mainland Greece, others adopted Egyptian customs, while Egyptians continued to follow their own already ancient customs.\n\nVery few Ptolemaic tombs are known. Fine temple statuary of the period suggests the possibility of tomb sculpture and offering tables. Egyptian elite burials still made use of stone sarcophagi. ''Books of the Dead'' and amulets were also still popular.<ref>{{cite book|last1=[[Edward Bleiberg|Bleiberg]]|first1=Edward|title=To Live Forever: Egyptian Treasure from the Brooklyn Museum|date=2008|publisher=Brooklyn Museum|location=Brooklyn, NY|page=103}}</ref>\n\n===Roman period, Roman influences===\n[[File: The Mummy of Demetrios, 95-100 C.E.,11.600.jpg|thumbnail|The Mummy of Demetrios, 95\u2013100 C.E.,11.600, [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]\nThe Romans conquered Egypt in 30 B.C., ending the rule of the last and most famous member of the [[Ptolemaic dynasty]], [[Cleopatra|Cleopatra VII]]. During Roman rule, an elite hybrid burial style developed incorporating both Egyptian and Roman elements.\n\nSome people were mummified and wrapped in linen bandages. The front of the mummy was often painted with a selection of traditional Egyptian symbols. Mummy masks in either traditional Egyptian style or Roman style could be added to the mummies. Another possibility was a Roman-style mummy portrait, executed in [[Encaustic painting|encaustic]] (pigment suspended in wax) on a wooden panel. Sometimes the feet of the mummy was covered. An alternative to this was a complete shroud with Egyptian motifs but a portrait in the Roman style. Tombs of the elite could also include fine jewelry.<ref>{{cite book|last1=[[Edward Bleiberg|Bleiberg]]|first1=Edward|title=To Live Forever: Egyptian Treasure from the Brooklyn Museum|date=2008|publisher=Brooklyn Museum|location=Brooklyn, NY|pages=103\u2013106}}</ref>\n\n==Funerary rituals==\n{{see also|Dance in ancient Egypt#Funeral Dances}}\n{{wide image|BD Funeral.jpg|1000px|A funeral procession depicted in the ''[[Book of the Dead]]''}}\nGreek historians [[Herodotus]] (5th century BC) and [[Diodorus Siculus]] (1st century BC) provide the most complete, surviving evidence of how Ancient Egyptians approached the preservation of a dead body.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Tomorad|first=Mladen|date=May 2009|title=Ancient Egyptian funerary practices from the first millennium BC to the Arab conquest of Egypt (c. 1069 BC-642 AD)|url=https://www.academia.edu/907351|journal=The Heritage of Egypt|volume=2|pages=12\u201328|via=}}</ref> Before embalming, or preserving the dead body as to delay or prevent decay, mourners, especially if the deceased had high status, covered their faces with mud, and paraded around town while beating their chests.<ref name=\":2\" /> If the wife of a high-status male died, her body was not embalmed until three or four days have passed, because this prevented abuse of the corpse.<ref name=\":2\" /> In the case that someone drowned or was attacked, embalming was carried out immediately on their body, in a sacred and careful manner.

Next, the embalmers escorted the body to ''ibw'', translated to \u201cplace of purification,\u201d a tent in which the body was washed, and then ''per nefer'', \u201cthe House of Beauty,\u201d where mummification took place.<ref name=\":2\" />[[File:Bemalte Mumienbinde.JPG|thumb|left|Painted mummy bandage]]\n\n=== Mummification process ===\nIn order to live for all eternity and be presented in front of [[Osiris]], the body of the deceased had to be preserved by [[mummy|mummification]], so that the [[Ancient Egyptian concept of the soul|soul]] could reunite with it, and take pleasure in the afterlife. The main process of mummification was preserving the body by [[dehydrating]] it using [[natron]], a natural material found in [[Wadi Natrun]] which is like a combination of baking soda and salt. The body was drained of any liquids and left with the skin, hair and muscles preserved.<ref>Salima Ikram, Ancient Egypt, pp. 275\u2013282</ref>\n\n[[File:Seti I memmy head.png|thumb|Mummy of pharaoh [[Seti I]].]]The process of mummification was available for anyone who could afford it. It was believed that even those who could not afford this process could still enjoy the afterlife with the right reciting of spells. Mummification existed in three different processes, ranging from most expensive, moderately expensive, and most simplistic, or cheapest.<ref name=\":2\" /> The most classic, common, and most expensive method of mummification dates back to the [[18th Dynasty]]. The first step was to remove the internal organs and liquid so that the body would not decay. The embalmers took out the brain through a process named [[excerebration]] by inserting a metal hook through the nostril, breaking through it into the brain. They removed as much as they could with the hook, and the rest they liquefied with drugs and drained out.<ref name=\":2\" /> They threw out the brain because they thought that the heart did all the thinking. The next step was to remove the internal organs, the lungs, liver, stomach, and intestines, and place them in [[canopic jars]] with lids shaped like the heads of the protective deities, the [[four sons of Horus]]: Imsety, Hapy, Duamutef, and Qebhseneuf. [[Imset]]y was human-headed, and guarded the liver; [[Hapi (Son of Horus)|Hapy]] was ape-headed, and guarded the lungs; [[Duamutef]] was jackal-headed, and guarded the stomach; [[Qebehsenuef|Qebhseneuf]] was hawk-headed, and guarded the small and large intestines.<sup>[[Ancient Egyptian funerary practices#cite note-25|[25]]]</sup> Sometimes the four canopic jars were placed into a [[canopic chest]], and buried with the mummified body. A canopic chest resembled a \"miniature coffin\" and was intricately painted. The Ancient Egyptians believed that by burying the deceased with their organs, they may rejoin with them in the afterlife.<sup>[[Ancient Egyptian funerary practices#cite note-26|[26]]]</sup> Other times, the organs were cleaned and cleansed, and then returned into the body.<ref name=\":2\" /> The body cavity was then rinsed and cleaned with wine and an array of spices. The body was sewn up with aromatic plants and spices left inside.<ref name=\":2\" /> The heart stayed in the body, because in the hall of judgment, it would be weighed against the feather of [[Ma'at]]. After the body was washed with wine, it was stuffed with bags of [[natron]]. The dehydration process took 40 days.<sup>[[Ancient Egyptian funerary practices#cite note-27|[27]]]</sup>\n\nThe second part of the process took 30 days. This was the time where the deceased turned into a semi divine being, and all that was left in the body from the first part was removed, followed by applying first wine and then oils. The oils were for ritual purposes, as well as for preventing the limbs and bones from breaking while being wrapped. The body was sometimes colored with a golden resin, which protected the body from bacteria and insects. Additionally, this practice was based on the belief that divine beings had flesh of gold. Next, the body was wrapped in linen cut into strips with [[amulets]] while a priest recited prayers and burned [[incense]].

Instead, the embalmers injected the oil of a cedar tree into the body, which prevented liquid from leaving the body. The body was then laid in natron for a specific number of days. The oil was then drained out of the body, and with it came the internal organs, the stomach and the intestines, which were liquefied by the cedar oil. The flesh dissolved in the natron, which left only skin and bones left of the deceased body.

The [[opening of the mouth ceremony]] was conducted by a priest who would utter a spell and touch the mummy or [[sarcophagus]] with a ceremonial [[adze]]&nbsp;\u2013 a copper or stone blade. This ceremony ensured that the mummy could breathe and speak in the afterlife. In a similar fashion, the priest could utter spells to reanimate the mummy's arms, legs, and other body parts.\n\nThe priests, maybe even the king's successor, move the body through the causeway to the [[mortuary temple]]. This is where prayers were recited, incense was burned, and more rituals were performed to help prepare the king for his final journey. The king's mummy was then placed inside the pyramid along with enormous amount of food, drink, furniture, clothes, and jewelry which were to be used in the afterlife.\n\nThe pyramid was sealed so that no one would ever enter it again. However the king's soul could move through the burial chamber as it wished. After the funeral the king becomes a god and could be worshipped in the temples beside his pyramid.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Janice Kamrin and Salima Ikram, pp. 10\u201311</ref>\n\nIn ancient times Egyptians were buried directly in the ground.

Therefore, the Ancient Egyptians were very serious about the way in which the tombs were built.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite book|title=Death and the afterlife in ancient Egypt|last=1958-|first=Taylor, John H.|date=2001|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0226791647|location=Chicago|oclc=45195698}}</ref> Two hallmarks of the tomb included (1) a burial chamber, which housed the physical body of the deceased (inside a coffin) as well as funerary objects deemed most important, and (2) A \"cult place,\" which resembled a chapel where mourners, family, and friends could congregate. The tomb of a king included a full temple, instead of a chapel.<ref name=\":5\"/>\n\nTypically, the tomb of a deceased person was located somewhere close by their home community. The Ancient Egyptians opted to bury the deceased in land that was not particularly fertile or useful for vegetation. Therefore, tombs were mostly built in desert areas. Tombs were usually built near each other, and rarely stood alone. For a deceased king, however, the tomb was located in a place of utmost sacredness.<ref name=\":5\"/>\n\nIn the [[Prehistoric Egypt]], bodies were buried in deserts because they would naturally be preserved by dehydration. The \"graves\" were small oval or rectangular pits dug in the sand. They could give the body of the deceased in a tight position on its left side alongside a few jars of food and drink and slate palettes with magical religious spells. The size of graves eventually increased but according to status and wealth. The dry, desert conditions were a benefit in ancient Egypt for burials of the poor, who could not afford the complex burial preparations that the wealthy had.\n\nThe simple graves evolved into [[mudbrick]] structures called ''[[mastabas]].'' Royal mastabas later developed into \"step pyramids\" and then \"true pyramids.\"<ref>Leonard Lesko, pp. 4\u20135</ref> As soon as a king took the throne he would start to build his pyramid. Rituals of the burial, including the \"Opening of the mouth ceremony\" took place at the [[Menkaure#Valley Temple|Valley Temple]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /><ref>John Taylor, pp. 187\u2013193</ref> While a pyramid's large size was made to protect against robbery, it may also be connected to a religious belief about the sun god, [[Ra]].<ref>Leonard Lesko pp. 4\u20135</ref>\n\nA majority of cemeteries were located on the west bank of the Nile, which was metaphorically viewed as \"the realm of the dead.\" The tomb was said to represent the deceased's place in the cosmos, which ultimately depended on the social class of the deceased. If the deceased was of a notably high-class, they were buried near the king, whereas middle and lower class individuals were simply buried near the communities in which they had lived.<ref name=\":5\"/> In many cases, the tombs of the high-class were situated in accordance with the tombs of the lower classes so that they would be viewed as a \"focal point.\" For example, one burial site was designed so that the tombs of the governors were placed alongside the slope of a hill, whereas the tombs of the governor's attendants were placed at the foot of the hill.<ref name=\":5\"/>\n\n==Coffins==\n[[File:Exhibit at Lovre Museum, Paris 01.jpg|thumb|Coffin of a mummy at Louvre, Paris]]\nAfter having been preserved, the mummy was placed into a coffin. Although the coffins that housed the deceased bodies were made simply of wood, they were intricately painted and designed to suit each individual. During the Old Kingdom, the following was included on each coffin: the title of the deceased, a list of offerings, a false compartment through which ka could pass through, and painted eyes so that the deceased could look through the coffin.<ref name=\":62\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.spurlock.illinois.edu/exhibits/online/mummification/artifacts6.html|title=Artifacts: Mummy Cases, Coffins, and Sarcophagi, Mummification, Online Exhibits, Exhibits, Spurlock Museum, U of I|website=www.spurlock.illinois.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-04-07}}</ref> The decorations on the coffin usually fit the deceased's status.\n\nDuring the Middle Kingdom, the coffin was treated as if it were a \"miniature tomb\" and was painted and inscribed like so. Goddesses Isis and Nephthys were painted on the coffins, and were said to guard the deceased in the afterlife. Along the sides of the coffins, the four sons of Horus were painted, amongst other gods. Prayers were often inscribed on the coffins as well.<ref name=\":62\" />\n\nAnthropoid coffins soon emerged, which were tailored to the contour of the deceased's body. The deceased's face and hair was painted onto the coffin so to personalize it further.<ref name=\":62\" /> A sarcophagus, which is a large, stone container, was used to house the coffin, and provide supplementary protection to the dead body. The Ancient Egyptians translated the word \"sarcophagus\" to mean \"possessor of life,\" and therefore, the sarcophagus would aid the deceased into the afterlife.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.historyembalmed.org/egyptian-mummies/sarcophagus.htm|title=Sarcophagus|website=www.historyembalmed.org|access-date=2018-04-07}}</ref>\n\n== Damnation ==\nOne of the funerary practices followed by the Egyptians was preparing properly for the afterlife. Ka, the vital force within the [[Ancient Egyptian concept of the soul]], would not return to the deceased body if embalming was not carried out in the proper fashion.<ref name=\":3\" /> In this case, the body decayed, and possibly became unrecognizable, which rendered the afterlife unattainable for the deceased person.<ref name=\":2\" /> If the proper precautions were not taken, damnation would occur.

Most funerary literature consists of lists of spells and instructions for navigating the afterlife. During the Old Kingdom, only the pharaoh had access to this material, which scholars refer to as the ''[[Pyramid Texts]]''. The Pyramid Texts are a collection of spells to assure the royal resurrection and protect the pharaoh from various malignant influences. The Pharaoh [[Unas]] was the first to use this collection of spells, as he and a few subsequent pharaohs had them carved on the walls of their [[pyramid]]s.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.digitalegypt.ucl.ac.uk/literature/religious/pyramid.html |title=Digital Egypt, Pyramid texts |access-date=2018-07-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140303120804/http://www.digitalegypt.ucl.ac.uk/literature/religious/pyramid.html |archive-date=2014-03-03 |url-status=dead }}</ref> These texts were individually chosen from a larger bank of spells.\n\nIn the [[First Intermediate Period]] and in the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]], some of the Pyramid Text spells also are found in burial chambers of high officials and on many coffins, where they begin to evolve into what scholars call the ''[[Coffin Texts]]''. In this period, the nobles and many non-royal Egyptians began to have access to funerary literature. Although many spells from the earlier texts were carried over, the new coffin texts also had additional spells, along with slight changes made to make this new funerary text more fit for the nobility.<ref name=\"Erik Hornung\">Erik Hornung, The Ancient Egyptian Book of the Afterlife, (Cornell: Cornell University Press, 1999) p. 7</ref>\n\nIn The [[New Kingdom]], the Coffin texts became the Book of the Dead, or the Funeral Papyri, and would last through the Late Kingdom. The text in these books was divided according to chapters/ spells, which were almost two-hundred in number. Each one of these texts was individualized for the deceased, though to varying degrees. If the person was rich enough, then they could commission their own personal version of the text that would include only the spells that they wanted. However, if one was not so wealthy, then one had to make do with the pre-made versions that had spaces left for the name of the deceased.\n\nIf the scribe ran out of room while doing the transcription, he would just stop the spell wherever he was and would not continue.<ref>Raymond O. Faulkner, The Ancient Egyptian [[Book of the Dead|Book of The Dead]], (New York, [[British Museum]] Publications, 1985) p. 11.</ref> It is not until the [[Twenty-sixth Dynasty of Egypt|Twenty-sixth Dynasty]] that there began to be any regulation of the order or even the number of spells that were to be included in the Book of the Dead.\nAt this time, the regulation is set at 192 spells to be placed in the book, with certain ones holding the same place at all times.<ref>Raymond O. Faulkner, The Ancient Egyptian Book of The Dead, (New York, British Museum Publications, 1985) p. 11.</ref> This makes it seem as if the order of the texts was not what was important, so the person could place them in an order that he was comfortable with, but rather that it was what was written that mattered.\n\n==Judgement==\nThe idea of judgement went as follows: in order to be considered for the admittance into the afterlife, those who died were obligated to undergo a multi-step judgement by certain gods.<ref name=\":5\"/> The concept and belief in judgement is outlined in the ''[[Book of the Dead]]'', a funerary text of the new kingdom. The Book of the Dead is composed of spells relating to the deceased and the afterlife. Spell 125, in particular, is understood to be delivered by the deceased at the outset of the judgement process.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nThe visual picture of what judgement looks like has been discovered through Ancient Egyptian ruins and artefacts. The procedure was depicted as follows: The deceased's heart was weighed in comparison to a feather, while a vicious beast awaited to eat the heart (if the deceased was found to be a sinner).<ref name=\":5\" /> [[Osiris]] was the judge (among others), and represented an ideal output of the judgement process for the deceased who entered his judgement hall. This is because he resurrected and regained his godly status after he was justified against his brother Seth, who wrongly murdered him.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Mark|first=Smith|date=2008-10-27|title=Osiris and the Deceased|url=https://escholarship.org/uc/item/29r70244|language=en|volume=1|issue=1}}</ref> The deceased pleaded to Osiris, among 42 judges, that they had not committed sin, which is known as a \"negative confession.\"<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe 42 judges assessed how virtuous the life of the deceased was, and this represented the principal element of the deceased entering the afterlife. After passing judgement, the family and friends of the deceased celebrated them and boasted about their righteousness to attain entry into the afterlife.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==Burial goods==\n[[File:Egyptian funerary figurines louvre 180flip.jpg|thumb|upright|A selection of shabti statues.]] \nAlthough the types of [[burial goods]] changed throughout ancient Egyptian history, their purpose to protect the deceased and provide sustenance in the afterlife remained.\n\nFrom the earliest periods of Egyptian history, all Egyptians were buried with at least some goods that they thought were necessary after death. At a minimum, these consisted of everyday objects such as bowls, combs, and other trinkets, along with food. Wealthier Egyptians could afford to be buried with jewelry, furniture, and other valuables, which made them targets of tomb robbers. In the early Dynastic Period, tombs were filled with daily life objects, such as furniture, jewelry and other valuables. They also contained many stone and pottery vessels.<ref>Grajetzki, ''Burial Customs'', pp. 7\u201314</ref>\n\nAs burial customs developed in the Old Kingdom, wealthy citizens were buried in wooden or stone coffins. However, the number of burial goods declined. They were often just a set of copper models, tools and vessels.<ref>Grajetzki, ''Burial Customs'', pp. 15\u201326</ref> Starting in the First Intermediate period, [[Wooden tomb model|wooden models]] became very popular burial goods. These wooden models often depict everyday activities that the deceased expected to continue doing in the afterlife. Also, a type of rectangular [[coffin]] became the standard, being brightly painted and often including an [[Ancient Egyptian offering formula|offering formula]]. Objects of daily use were not often included in the tombs during this period.\n\n[[File:Egyptian - Heart Scarab of Bak-en-Djehuti - Walters 42380 - Back.jpg|thumb|left|The ancient Egyptians put green stone scarab beetles into the coffins of important people, along with the mummified bodies.]]\nAt the end of the Middle Kingdom, new object types were introduced into burials, such as the first shabtis and the first heart scarabs. [[ushabti|Shabtis]] were little clay statues made to perform tasks on command for the pharaoh. Now objects of daily use appear in tombs again, often magical items already employed for protecting the living. Scarabs (beetles) collect animal dung and roll it into little balls. To the Egyptians, these balls looked like the life-giving Sun, so they hoped that scarabs would bring them long life. [[scarab (artifact)|Scarabs]] have been found in tombs and graves.<ref>{{cite book|author=Starry Dog|title=Biggest Ever Book of Questions & Answers|year=2003|publisher=WS PACIFIC PUBLICATIONS, INC|isbn=978-1-4454-8792-2|pages=71|chapter=History: Ancient Egypt}}</ref>\n\nIn the New Kingdom, some of the old burial customs changed. For example, an anthropoid coffin shape became standardized, and the deceased were provided with a small shabti statue, which the Egyptians believed would perform work for them in the afterlife. Elite burials were often filled with objects of daily use. Under [[Ramesses II|Ramses II]] and later all daily life objects disappear from tombs. They most often only contained a selection of items especially made for the burial. Also, in later burials, the numbers of shabti statues increased; in some burials, numbering more than four hundred statues. In addition to these shabti statues, the deceased could be buried with many different types of magical figurines to protect them from harm.\n\n== Funerary Boats ==\nFunerary boats were a part of some ancient Egyptian burials.<ref>Mary Ann Sullivan, [https://www.bluffton.edu/~sullivanm/egypt/giza/boat/boat.html ''Solar Boat/Funerary Boat of Cheops (Khufu)''], \u00a9 2001. Retrieved May 9, 2013.</ref> Boats played a major role in Egyptian religion because they were conceived as the main means by which the gods traveled across the sky and through to the netherworld. One type of boat used at funerals was for making pilgrimages to holy sites such as [[Abydos, Egypt|Abydos]]. A large funerary boat, for example, was found near the pyramid of the Old Kingdom [[Khufu|Pharaoh Cheops]]. The funerary boats are called [[Felucca]] and they were usually made of wood; the Egyptians used a collection of papyrus reeds and tied them together with the wood very tightly.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dkfindout.com/us/history/ancient-egypt/ancient-egyptian-boats/|title=DK Find Out! {{!}} Fun Facts for Kids on Animals, Earth, History and more!|website=DK Find Out!|language=en|access-date=2017-11-17}}</ref> The most common route for funerary boats was the River Nile to the afterlife. The boat carried the coffin and often had a dog in the boat since they believed a dog would lead the deceased to the afterlife.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://australianmuseum.net.au/image/ancient-egyptian-model-funerary-boat|title=Ancient Egyptian model funerary boat - Australian Museum|website=australianmuseum.net.au|language=en|access-date=2017-11-17}}</ref> The boats usually measured about 20 feet or longer. These however didn't match those of the great pharaohs like Pharaoh Khufu (who built the Great Pyramid.) His funerary boat was approximately 144 foot long with 12 oars. Common funerary boats were smaller sized with few oars.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://classroom.synonym.com/ancient-egypt-funeral-boats-6445.html|title=Facts of Ancient Egypt Funeral Boats {{!}} Synonym|access-date=2017-11-17|language=en}}</ref>\n\n== Role of Animals ==\nSeveral kinds of animal remains have been discovered in tombs all around Dayr al-Barsha, a Coptic village in Middle Egypt. The remains found in the shafts and burial chambers included dogs, foxes, eagle owls, bats, rodents, and snakes. These were determined to be individuals that had entered the deposits by accident. Other animal remains that were found were more common and recurred more than those individuals that wound up accidentally trapped in these tombs. These remains included numerous gazelle and cattle bones, as well as calves and goats which were believed to have been in result of human behavior. This was due to finding that some remains had fragments altered, missing, or separated from their original skeletons. These remains also had traces of paint and cut marks on them, seen especially with cattle skulls and feet. Based on this, the natural environment of the Dayr al-Barsha tombs, and the fact that only some parts of these animals were found, the possibility of natural deposition can be ruled out, and the cause of these remains in fact are most likely caused by animal sacrifices, as only the head, foreleg, and feet were apparently selected for deposition within the tombs. According to a study by Christopher Eyre, cattle meat was actually not a part of the daily diet in Ancient Egypt, as the consumption of meat only took place during celebrations including funerary and mortuary rituals, and the practice of providing the deceased with offerings of cattle going back to the Predynastic Period.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=De Meyer|first1=Marleen|last2=Van Neer|first2=Wim|last3=Peeters|first3=Christoph|last4=Willems|first4=Harco|title=The Role of Animals in the Funerary Rites at Dayr al-Barsh\u0101|journal=Journal of the American Research Center in Egypt|date=2005|volume=42|pages=45\u201371|jstor=27651798}}</ref>\n\n==Ancient Egyptian mummification and funeral in fiction==\n* [[Boles\u0142aw Prus]], ''[[Pharaoh (novel)|Pharaoh]]'' (1895), depicts the whole process of mummification and funeral at the fall of the [[20th Dynasty]] and [[New Kingdom]].\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Ancient Egypt}}\n* [[Death and afterlife in Ancient Egypt]]\n* [[Mummy#Egyptian mummies|Egyptian mummies]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n* Allen, James P.

Some also believe they may have feared the bodies would rise again if mistreated after death.<ref>[[Fran\u00e7oise Dunand]] and Roger Lichtenberg, Mummies and Death in Egypt, (London: [[Cornell University|Cornell University Press]], 2006), p. 9</ref>\n\nEarly bodies were buried in simple, shallow oval pits, with a few burial goods. Sometimes multiple people and animals were placed in the same grave. Over time, graves became more complex, with the body placed in a wicker basket, then later in wooden or [[terracotta]] coffins. The latest tombs Egyptians made were sarcophagi. These graves contained burial goods like jewelry, food, games and sharpened splint.<ref>Fran\u00e7oise Dunand and Roger Lichtenberg, Mummies and Death in Egypt, (London: Cornell University Press, 2006), p. 7</ref>\n\nThis demonstrates that this ancient period had a sense of the afterlife, though archaeological evidence may show the average person had little chance of getting into it. This may be because admission required that the deceased must be able to serve a purpose there. The [[pharaoh]] was allowed in because of his role in life, and others needed to have some role there.\n\n[[Ancient Egyptian retainer sacrifices|Human sacrifice]]s found in early royal tombs reinforce this view. Those sacrificed were probably meant to serve the pharaoh in his afterlife. Eventually, [[Ushabti|figurines]] and wall paintings begin to replace human victims.<ref>Sergio Donadoni, ''The Egyptians'', (Chicago: [[University of Chicago Press]], 1997) p. 262</ref> Some of these figurines may have been created to resemble certain people, so they could follow the pharaoh after their lives ended.\n\nNote that not only the [[Social class|lower classes]] had to rely on the pharaoh's favor, but also the noble classes. They believed that when he died, the pharaoh became some sort of god, who could bestow upon certain individuals the ability to have an afterlife. This belief existed from the predynastic period through the [[Old Kingdom]].\n\nAlthough many spells from the predeceasing texts were carried over, the new coffin texts also had additional new spells added, along with slight changes made to make this new [[funerary text]] more relatable to the nobility.<ref name=\" Erik Hornung\"/> In the [[First Intermediate Period of Egypt|First Intermediate Period]], however, the importance of the pharaoh declined. Funerary texts, previously restricted to royal use, became more widely available. The pharaoh was no longer a [[god-king]] in the sense that only he was allowed in the next life due to his status here, now he was merely the ruler of the population who upon his death would be leveled down towards the plane of the mortals.<ref>John A. Wilson, The Culture of Ancient Egypt, (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1965), p. 116.</ref>\n\n===Prehistory, earliest burials===\nThe first funerals in Egypt are known from the villages of Omari and [[Maadi]] in the north, near present-day [[Cairo]]. The people of these villages buried their dead in a simple, round grave with a pot. The body was neither treated nor arranged in a regular way as would be the case later in the historical period. Without any written evidence, there is little to provide information about contemporary beliefs concerning the afterlife except for the regular inclusion of a single pot in the grave. Given later customs, the pot was probably intended to hold food for the deceased.<ref>{{cite book|last1=[[Edward Bleiberg|Bleiberg]]|first1=Edward|title=To Live Forever: Egyptian Treasure from the Brooklyn Museum|date=2008|publisher=Brooklyn Museum|location=Brooklyn, NY|page=71}}</ref>\n\n===Predynastic period, development of customs===\nFunerary customs were developed during the [[Prehistoric Egypt|Predynastic period]] from those of the Prehistoric Period. At first, people excavated round graves with one pot in the [[Badari culture|Badarian Period]] (4400-3800 B.C.E.), continuing the tradition of Omari and Maadi cultures. By the end of the Predynastic period, there were increasing numbers of objects deposited with the body in rectangular graves, and there is growing evidence of rituals practiced by Egyptians of the [[Naqada culture|Naquada II Period]] (3650-3300 B.C.E). At this point, bodies were regularly arranged in a crouched or fetal position with the face toward either the east the rising sun or the west (which in this historical period was the land of the dead). Artists painted jars with funeral processions and perhaps ritual dancing. Figures of bare-breasted women with birdlike faces and their legs concealed under skirts also appeared in some graves. Some graves were much richer in goods than others, demonstrating the beginnings of social stratification. Gender differences in burial emerged with the inclusion of weapons in men's graves and cosmetics palettes in women's graves.<ref>{{cite book|last1=[[Edward Bleiberg|Bleiberg]]|first1=Edward|title=To Live Forever: Egyptian Treasure from the Brooklyn Museum|date=2008|publisher=Brooklyn Museum|location=Brooklyn, NY|pages=71\u201372}}</ref>\n\nBy 3,600 BCE, Egyptians had begun to mummify the dead, wrapping them in linen bandages with embalming oils (conifer resin and aromatic plant extracts).<ref>[https://www.livescience.com/63351-mummy-older-than-pharaohs.html Mindy Seisberger, 'This Ancient Mummy Is Older Than the Pharaohs', Live Science, 16 August 2016]</ref><ref>[https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2018/08/news-egyptian-prehistoric-mummy-embalming-recipe/ Maya Wei-Haas,'Mummy yields earliest known Egyptian embalming recipe', National Geographic,15 August 2018] </ref>\n\n===Early Dynastic Period, tombs and coffins===\nBy the [[First Dynasty of Egypt|First Dynasty]], some Egyptians were wealthy enough to build tombs over their burials rather than placing their bodies in simple pit graves dug into the sand. The rectangular, mud-brick tomb with an underground burial chamber, called a [[mastaba]], developed in this period. These tombs had niched walls, a style of building called the palace-fa\u00e7ade motif because the walls imitated those surrounding the palace of the king. Since commoners as well as kings, however, had such tombs, the architecture suggests that in death, some wealthy people did achieve an elevated status. Later in the historical period, it is certain that the deceased was associated with the god of the dead, [[Osiris]].\n\nGrave goods expanded to include furniture, jewelry, and games as well as the weapons, cosmetic palettes, and food supplies in decorated jars known earlier, in the Predynastic period. Now, however, in the richest tombs, grave goods numbered in the thousands. Only the newly invented coffins for the body were made specifically for the tomb. There is also some inconclusive evidence for mummification. Other objects in the tombs that had been used during daily life suggest that Egyptians already in the First Dynasty anticipated needing in the next life. Further continuity from this life into the next can be found in the positioning of tombs: those persons who served the king during their lifetimes chose burials close to their lord. The use of [[stele|stela]] in front of the tomb began in the First Dynasty, indicating a desire to individualize the tomb with the deceased's name.<ref>{{cite book|last1=[[Edward Bleiberg|Bleiberg]]|first1=Edward|title=To Live Forever: Egyptian Treasure from the Brooklyn Museum|date=2008|publisher=Brooklyn Museum|location=Brooklyn, NY|pages=72\u201373}}</ref>\n\n===Old Kingdom, pyramids and mummification===\n[[File: Relief of Men Presenting Oxen, ca. 2500-2350 B.C.E. Limestone.jpg|thumbnail|right|'' Relief of Men Presenting Oxen'', ca. 2500\u20132350 B.C.E. Limestone. In this relief, three men bring cattle to the tomb owner, \"from the towns of the estate,\" as the inscription says. Two of these balding, rustic laborers wear kilts of coarse material and the other wears nothing at all. A fragmentary scene below shows men bringing cranes, which Egyptians penned and raised for food. Artisans carved images of live food animals in tombs to supply the deceased with an eternal source of provisions. [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]\nIn the [[Old Kingdom of Egypt|Old Kingdom]], kings first built pyramids for their tombs surrounded by stone mastaba tombs for their high officials. The fact that most high officials were also royal relatives suggests another motivation for such placement: these complexes were also family cemeteries.\n\nAmong the elite, bodies were mummified, wrapped in linen bandages, sometimes covered with molded plaster, and placed in stone sarcophagi or plain wooden coffins. At the end of the Old Kingdom, mummy masks in [[cartonnage]] (linen soaked in plaster, modeled and painted) also appeared. Canopic containers now held their internal organs. Amulets of gold, [[Egyptian faience|faience]], and [[carnelian]] first appeared in various shapes to protect different parts of the body. There is also the first evidence of inscriptions inside the coffins of the elite during the Old Kingdom. Often, reliefs of everyday items were etched onto the walls supplemented grave goods, which made them available through their representation.\n\nThe new false door was a non-functioning stone sculpture of a door into the tomb, found either inside the chapel or on the outside of the mastaba; it served as a place to make offerings and recite prayers for the deceased. Statues of the deceased were now included in tombs and used for ritual purposes. Burial chambers of some private people received their first decorations in addition to the decoration of the chapels. At the end of the Old Kingdom, the burial chamber decorations depicted offerings, but not people.<ref>{{cite book|last1=[[Edward Bleiberg|Bleiberg]]|first1=Edward|title=To Live Forever: Egyptian Treasure from the Brooklyn Museum|date=2008|publisher=Brooklyn Museum|location=Brooklyn, NY|pages=74\u201377}}</ref>\n\n===First Intermediate Period, regional variation===\nThe political situation in the [[First Intermediate Period of Egypt|First Intermediate Period]], with many centers of power, is reflected in the many local styles of art and burial at this time. The many regional styles for decorating coffins make their origins easy to distinguish from each other. For example, some coffins have one-line inscriptions, and many styles include the depiction of ''Wadjet'' eyes (the human eye with the markings of a falcon). There are also regional variations in the [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphs]] used to decorate coffins.\n\nOccasionally men had tools and weapons in their graves, while some women had jewelry and cosmetic objects such as mirrors. Grindstones were sometimes included in women's tombs, perhaps to be considered a tool for food preparation in the next world, just as the weapons in men's tombs imply men's assignment to a role in fighting.<ref>{{cite book|last1=[[Edward Bleiberg|Bleiberg]]|first1=Edward|title=To Live Forever: Egyptian Treasure from the Brooklyn Museum|date=2008|publisher=Brooklyn Museum|location=Brooklyn, NY|page=77}}</ref>\n\n===Middle Kingdom, new tomb contents===\n[[File:Mask from a Coffin. Cartonnage,37.1387E.jpg|thumbnail|Mask from a coffin. Cartonnage, 37.1387E, [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]\n\nBurial customs in the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] reflect some of the political trends of this period. During the [[Eleventh Dynasty of Egypt|Eleventh Dynasty]], tombs were cut into the mountains of [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] surrounding the king's tomb or in local cemeteries in [[Upper Egypt|Upper]] and [[Middle Egypt]]; Thebes was the native city of the Eleventh Dynasty kings, and they preferred to be buried there. But the [[Twelfth Dynasty of Egypt|Twelfth Dynasty]], high officials served the kings of a new family now ruling from the north in [[Lisht]]; these kings and their high officials preferred burial in a mastaba near the pyramids belonging to their masters. Moreover, the difference in topography between Thebes and Lisht led to a difference in tomb type: in the north, nobles build mastaba tombs on the flat desert plains, while in the south, local dignitaries continued to excavate tombs in the mountain.\n\nFor those of ranks lower than royal courtiers during the Eleventh Dynasty, tombs were simpler. Coffins could be simple wooden boxes with the body either mummified and wrapped in linen or simply wrapped without mummification, and the addition of a cartonnage mummy mask. Some tombs included wooded shoes and a simple statue near the body. In one burial there were only twelve loaves of bread, a leg of beef, and a jar of beer for food offerings. Jewelry could be included but only rarely were objects of great value found in non-elite graves. Some burials continued to include the [[Wooden tomb model|wooden models]] that were popular during the [[First Intermediate Period of Egypt|First Intermediate Period]]. Wooden models of boats, scenes of food production, craftsmen and workshops, and professions such as scribes or soldiers have been found in the tombs of this period.\n\nSome rectangular coffins of the Twelfth Dynasty have short inscriptions and representations of the most important offerings the deceased required. For men, the objects depicted were weapons and symbols of office as well as food. Women's coffins depicted mirrors, sandals, and jars containing food and drink. Some coffins included texts that were later versions of the royal [[Pyramid Texts]].\n\nAnother kind of faience model of the deceased as a mummy seems to anticipate the use of ''[[shabti]]'' figurines (also called ''shawabti'' or an ''ushabti'') later in the Twelfth Dynasty. These early figurines do not have the text directing the figure to work in the place of the deceased that is found in later figurines. The richest people had stone figurines that seem to anticipate ''shabtis'', though some scholars have seen them as mummy substitutes rather than servant figures.\n\nIn the later Twelfth Dynasty, significant changes occurred in burials, perhaps reflecting administrative changes enacted by King [[Senusret III|Senwosret III]] (1836\u20131818 B.C.E.). The body was now regularly placed on its back, rather than its side as had been done for thousands of years. Coffin texts and wooden models disappeared from new tombs of the period while heart scarabs and figurines shaped like mummies were now often included in burials, as they would be for the remainder of Egyptian history. Coffin decoration was simplified. The [[Thirteenth Dynasty of Egypt|Thirteenth Dynasty]] saw another change in decoration. Different motifs were found in the north and south, a reflection of decentralized government power at the time. There was also a marked increase in the number of burials in one tomb, a rare occurrence in earlier periods. The reuse of one tomb by a family over generations seems to have occurred when wealth was more equitably spread.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bleiberg |first1=Edward |author-link=Edward Bleiberg |title=To Live Forever: Egyptian Treasure from the Brooklyn Museum|date=2008|publisher=Brooklyn Museum|location=Brooklyn, NY|pages=77\u201386}}</ref>\n\n===Second Intermediate Period, foreigner burials===\nKnown graves from the [[Second Intermediate Period of Egypt|Second Intermediate Period]] reveal the presence of non-Egyptians buried in the country. In the north, graves associated with the [[Hyksos]], a western [[Semitic people]] ruling the north from the northeast delta, include small mud-brick structures containing the body, pottery vessels, a dagger in a men's graves and often a nearby donkey burial. Simple pan-shaped graves in various parts of the country are thought to belong to [[Nubia]]n soldiers. Such graves reflect very ancient customs and feature shallow, round pits, bodies contracted and minimal food offerings in pots. The occasional inclusion of identifiable Egyptian materials from the Second Intermediate Period provides the only marks distinguishing these burials from those of Predynastic and even earlier periods.<ref>{{cite book |last1=[[Edward Bleiberg|Bleiberg]] |first1=Edward |title=To Live Forever: Egyptian Treasure from the Brooklyn Museum |year=2008 |publisher=Brooklyn Museum |location=Brooklyn, New York|pages=86\u201389}}</ref>\n\n===New Kingdom, new object purposes===\n[[File:S10.08 Deir-El-Bahari, image 9932.jpg|thumbnail|Deir-El-Bahari]]\nThe majority of elite tombs in the [[New Kingdom of Egypt|New Kingdom]] were rock-cut chambers. Kings were buried in multi-roomed, rock-cut tombs in the [[Valley of the Kings]] and no longer in pyramids. Priests conducted funerary rituals for them in stone temples built on the west bank of the [[Nile]] opposite of Thebes. From the current evidence, the [[Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt|Eighteenth Dynasty]] appears to be the last period in which Egyptians regularly included multiple objects from their daily lives in their tombs; beginning in the [[Nineteenth Dynasty of Egypt|Nineteenth Dynasty]], tombs contained fewer items from daily life and included objects made especially for the next world. Thus the change from the Eighteenth to the Nineteenth Dynasties formed a dividing line in burial traditions: The Eighteenth Dynasty more closely remembered the immediate past in its customs whereas the Nineteenth Dynasty anticipated the customs of the [[Late Period of ancient Egypt|Late Period]].\n\n[[File: Tutankhamun's bed (Cairo Museum).jpg|thumb|Gilded bier fashioned to resemble the goddess [[Sekhmet]], the fierce protector of the kings in life and death, from the tomb of [[Tutankhamun]], Cairo Museum]] \nPeople of the elite ranks in the Eighteenth Dynasty placed furniture as well as clothing and other items in their tombs, objects they undoubtedly used during life on earth. Beds, headrests, chairs, stools, leather sandals, jewelry, musical instruments, and wooden storage chests were present in these tombs. While all of the objects listed were for the elite, many poor people did not put anything beyond weapons and cosmetics into their tombs.\n\nNo elite tombs survive unplundered from the [[New Kingdom of Egypt|Ramesside period]]. In this period, artists decorated tombs belonging to the elite with more scene of religious events, rather than the everyday scene that had been popular since the Old Kingdom. The funeral itself, the funerary meal with multiple relatives, the worshipping of the gods, even figures in the underworld were subjects in elite tomb decorations. The majority of objects found in the Ramesside period tombs were made for the afterlife. Aside from the jewelry, which could have been used also during life, objects in Ramesside tombs were manufactured for the next world.<ref>{{cite book |last1=[[Edward Bleiberg|Bleiberg]] |first1=Edward |title=To Live Forever: Egyptian Treasure from the Brooklyn Museum |year=2008 |publisher=Brooklyn Museum |location=Brooklyn, New York |pages=89\u2013100}}</ref>\n\n===Third Intermediate Period===\n[[File: Funerary Figurine of King Pinudjem I, ca. 1025-1007 B.C.E., 16.190.jpg|thumbnail|Shabties of King Pinudjem I, ca. 1025\u20131007 B.C.E., 16.190, [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]\nAlthough the political structure of the New Kingdom collapsed at the end of the [[Twentieth Dynasty of Egypt|Twentieth Dynasty]], the majority of burials in the [[Twenty-first Dynasty of Egypt|Twenty-first Dynasty]] directly reflect developments from the earlier period. At the beginning of this time, reliefs resembled those from the Ramesside period. Only at the very end of the [[Third Intermediate Period of Egypt|Third Intermediate Period]] did new funerary practices of the Late Period begin to be seen.\n\nLittle is known of tombs from this period. The very lack of decorations in tombs seems to have led to much more elaborate decoration of coffins. The remaining grave goods of the period show fairly cheaply made ''shabties'', even when the owner was a queen or a princess.<ref>{{cite book|last1=[[Edward Bleiberg|Bleiberg]]|first1=Edward|title=To Live Forever: Egyptian Treasure from the Brooklyn Museum|date=2008|publisher=Brooklyn Museum|location=Brooklyn, NY|pages=100\u2013103}}</ref>\n\n===Late Period, monumentality and return to traditions===\nBurials in the [[Late Period of ancient Egypt|Late Period]] could make use of large-scale, temple-like tombs built for the non-royal elite for the first time. But the majority of tombs in this period were in shafts sunk into the desert floor. In addition to fine statuary and reliefs reflecting the style of the Old Kingdom, the majority of grave goods were specially made for the tomb. Coffins continued to bear religious texts and scenes. Some shafts were personalized by the use of stela with the deceased prayers and name on it. ''Shabties'' in faience for all classes are known. Canopic jars, though often nonfunctional, continued to be included. Staves and scepters representing the deceased's office in life were often present as well. A figure of either the god Osiris or of the composite deity Ptah-Sokar-Osiris could be found, along with heart scarabs, both gold and faience examples of djed-columns, [[Eye of Horus]] amulets, figures of gods, and images of the deceased's ''ba''. Tools for the tomb's ritual called the \"[[Opening of the mouth ceremony|opening of the mouth]]\" as well as \"magical bricks\" at the four compass points could be included.<ref>{{cite book |last1=[[Edward Bleiberg|Bleiberg]] |first1=Edward |title=To Live Forever: Egyptian Treasure from the Brooklyn Museum |year=2008 |publisher=Brooklyn Museum |location=Brooklyn, New York |page=103}}</ref>\n\n===Ptolemaic period, Hellenistic influences===\nFollowing Egypt's conquest by [[Alexander the Great]], the country was ruled by the descendants of [[Ptolemy I Soter|Ptolemy]], one of his generals. The Macedonian Greek family fostered a culture that promoted both [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] and ancient Egyptian ways of life: while many Greek-speaking people living in [[Alexandria]] followed the customs of mainland Greece, others adopted Egyptian customs, while Egyptians continued to follow their own already ancient customs.\n\nVery few Ptolemaic tombs are known. Fine temple statuary of the period suggests the possibility of tomb sculpture and offering tables. Egyptian elite burials still made use of stone sarcophagi. ''Books of the Dead'' and amulets were also still popular.<ref>{{cite book|last1=[[Edward Bleiberg|Bleiberg]]|first1=Edward|title=To Live Forever: Egyptian Treasure from the Brooklyn Museum|date=2008|publisher=Brooklyn Museum|location=Brooklyn, NY|page=103}}</ref>\n\n===Roman period, Roman influences===\n[[File: The Mummy of Demetrios, 95-100 C.E.,11.600.jpg|thumbnail|The Mummy of Demetrios, 95\u2013100 C.E.,11.600, [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]\nThe Romans conquered Egypt in 30 B.C., ending the rule of the last and most famous member of the [[Ptolemaic dynasty]], [[Cleopatra|Cleopatra VII]]. During Roman rule, an elite hybrid burial style developed incorporating both Egyptian and Roman elements.\n\nSome people were mummified and wrapped in linen bandages. The front of the mummy was often painted with a selection of traditional Egyptian symbols. Mummy masks in either traditional Egyptian style or Roman style could be added to the mummies. Another possibility was a Roman-style mummy portrait, executed in [[Encaustic painting|encaustic]] (pigment suspended in wax) on a wooden panel. Sometimes the feet of the mummy was covered. An alternative to this was a complete shroud with Egyptian motifs but a portrait in the Roman style. Tombs of the elite could also include fine jewelry.<ref>{{cite book|last1=[[Edward Bleiberg|Bleiberg]]|first1=Edward|title=To Live Forever: Egyptian Treasure from the Brooklyn Museum|date=2008|publisher=Brooklyn Museum|location=Brooklyn, NY|pages=103\u2013106}}</ref>\n\n==Funerary rituals==\n{{see also|Dance in ancient Egypt#Funeral Dances}}\n{{wide image|BD Funeral.jpg|1000px|A funeral procession depicted in the ''[[Book of the Dead]]''}}\nGreek historians [[Herodotus]] (5th century BC) and [[Diodorus Siculus]] (1st century BC) provide the most complete, surviving evidence of how Ancient Egyptians approached the preservation of a dead body.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Tomorad|first=Mladen|date=May 2009|title=Ancient Egyptian funerary practices from the first millennium BC to the Arab conquest of Egypt (c. 1069 BC-642 AD)|url=https://www.academia.edu/907351|journal=The Heritage of Egypt|volume=2|pages=12\u201328|via=}}</ref> Before embalming, or preserving the dead body as to delay or prevent decay, mourners, especially if the deceased had high status, covered their faces with mud, and paraded around town while beating their chests.<ref name=\":2\" /> If the wife of a high-status male died, her body was not embalmed until three or four days have passed, because this prevented abuse of the corpse.<ref name=\":2\" /> In the case that someone drowned or was attacked, embalming was carried out immediately on their body, in a sacred and careful manner.

Next, the embalmers escorted the body to ''ibw'', translated to \u201cplace of purification,\u201d a tent in which the body was washed, and then ''per nefer'', \u201cthe House of Beauty,\u201d where mummification took place.<ref name=\":2\" />[[File:Bemalte Mumienbinde.JPG|thumb|left|Painted mummy bandage]]\n\n=== Mummification process ===\nIn order to live for all eternity and be presented in front of [[Osiris]], the body of the deceased had to be preserved by [[mummy|mummification]], so that the [[Ancient Egyptian concept of the soul|soul]] could reunite with it, and take pleasure in the afterlife. The main process of mummification was preserving the body by [[dehydrating]] it using [[natron]], a natural material found in [[Wadi Natrun]] which is like a combination of baking soda and salt. The body was drained of any liquids and left with the skin, hair and muscles preserved.<ref>Salima Ikram, Ancient Egypt, pp. 275\u2013282</ref>\n\n[[File:Seti I memmy head.png|thumb|Mummy of pharaoh [[Seti I]].]]The process of mummification was available for anyone who could afford it. It was believed that even those who could not afford this process could still enjoy the afterlife with the right reciting of spells. Mummification existed in three different processes, ranging from most expensive, moderately expensive, and most simplistic, or cheapest.<ref name=\":2\" /> The most classic, common, and most expensive method of mummification dates back to the [[18th Dynasty]]. The first step was to remove the internal organs and liquid so that the body would not decay. The embalmers took out the brain through a process named [[excerebration]] by inserting a metal hook through the nostril, breaking through it into the brain. They removed as much as they could with the hook, and the rest they liquefied with drugs and drained out.<ref name=\":2\" /> They threw out the brain because they thought that the heart did all the thinking. The next step was to remove the internal organs, the lungs, liver, stomach, and intestines, and place them in [[canopic jars]] with lids shaped like the heads of the protective deities, the [[four sons of Horus]]: Imsety, Hapy, Duamutef, and Qebhseneuf. [[Imset]]y was human-headed, and guarded the liver; [[Hapi (Son of Horus)|Hapy]] was ape-headed, and guarded the lungs; [[Duamutef]] was jackal-headed, and guarded the stomach; [[Qebehsenuef|Qebhseneuf]] was hawk-headed, and guarded the small and large intestines.<sup>[[Ancient Egyptian funerary practices#cite note-25|[25]]]</sup> Sometimes the four canopic jars were placed into a [[canopic chest]], and buried with the mummified body. A canopic chest resembled a \"miniature coffin\" and was intricately painted. The Ancient Egyptians believed that by burying the deceased with their organs, they may rejoin with them in the afterlife.<sup>[[Ancient Egyptian funerary practices#cite note-26|[26]]]</sup> Other times, the organs were cleaned and cleansed, and then returned into the body.<ref name=\":2\" /> The body cavity was then rinsed and cleaned with wine and an array of spices. The body was sewn up with aromatic plants and spices left inside.<ref name=\":2\" /> The heart stayed in the body, because in the hall of judgment, it would be weighed against the feather of [[Ma'at]]. After the body was washed with wine, it was stuffed with bags of [[natron]]. The dehydration process took 40 days.<sup>[[Ancient Egyptian funerary practices#cite note-27|[27]]]</sup>\n\nThe second part of the process took 30 days. This was the time where the deceased turned into a semi divine being, and all that was left in the body from the first part was removed, followed by applying first wine and then oils. The oils were for ritual purposes, as well as for preventing the limbs and bones from breaking while being wrapped. The body was sometimes colored with a golden resin, which protected the body from bacteria and insects. Additionally, this practice was based on the belief that divine beings had flesh of gold. Next, the body was wrapped in linen cut into strips with [[amulets]] while a priest recited prayers and burned [[incense]].

Instead, the embalmers injected the oil of a cedar tree into the body, which prevented liquid from leaving the body. The body was then laid in natron for a specific number of days. The oil was then drained out of the body, and with it came the internal organs, the stomach and the intestines, which were liquefied by the cedar oil. The flesh dissolved in the natron, which left only skin and bones left of the deceased body. The remains are given back to the family.<ref name=\":2\" /> The cheapest, most basic method of mummification, which was often chosen by the poor, involved purging out the deceased's internal organs, and then laying the body in natron for 70 days.

The [[opening of the mouth ceremony]] was conducted by a priest who would utter a spell and touch the mummy or [[sarcophagus]] with a ceremonial [[adze]]&nbsp;\u2013 a copper or stone blade. This ceremony ensured that the mummy could breathe and speak in the afterlife. In a similar fashion, the priest could utter spells to reanimate the mummy's arms, legs, and other body parts.\n\nThe priests, maybe even the king's successor, move the body through the causeway to the [[mortuary temple]]. This is where prayers were recited, incense was burned, and more rituals were performed to help prepare the king for his final journey. The king's mummy was then placed inside the pyramid along with enormous amount of food, drink, furniture, clothes, and jewelry which were to be used in the afterlife.\n\nThe pyramid was sealed so that no one would ever enter it again. However the king's soul could move through the burial chamber as it wished. After the funeral the king becomes a god and could be worshipped in the temples beside his pyramid.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Janice Kamrin and Salima Ikram, pp. 10\u201311</ref>\n\nIn ancient times Egyptians were buried directly in the ground.

Therefore, the Ancient Egyptians were very serious about the way in which the tombs were built.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite book|title=Death and the afterlife in ancient Egypt|last=1958-|first=Taylor, John H.|date=2001|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0226791647|location=Chicago|oclc=45195698}}</ref> Two hallmarks of the tomb included (1) a burial chamber, which housed the physical body of the deceased (inside a coffin) as well as funerary objects deemed most important, and (2) A \"cult place,\" which resembled a chapel where mourners, family, and friends could congregate. The tomb of a king included a full temple, instead of a chapel.<ref name=\":5\"/>\n\nTypically, the tomb of a deceased person was located somewhere close by their home community. The Ancient Egyptians opted to bury the deceased in land that was not particularly fertile or useful for vegetation. Therefore, tombs were mostly built in desert areas. Tombs were usually built near each other, and rarely stood alone. For a deceased king, however, the tomb was located in a place of utmost sacredness.<ref name=\":5\"/>\n\nIn the [[Prehistoric Egypt]], bodies were buried in deserts because they would naturally be preserved by dehydration. The \"graves\" were small oval or rectangular pits dug in the sand. They could give the body of the deceased in a tight position on its left side alongside a few jars of food and drink and slate palettes with magical religious spells. The size of graves eventually increased but according to status and wealth. The dry, desert conditions were a benefit in ancient Egypt for burials of the poor, who could not afford the complex burial preparations that the wealthy had.\n\nThe simple graves evolved into [[mudbrick]] structures called ''[[mastabas]].'' Royal mastabas later developed into \"step pyramids\" and then \"true pyramids.\"<ref>Leonard Lesko, pp. 4\u20135</ref> As soon as a king took the throne he would start to build his pyramid. Rituals of the burial, including the \"Opening of the mouth ceremony\" took place at the [[Menkaure#Valley Temple|Valley Temple]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /><ref>John Taylor, pp. 187\u2013193</ref> While a pyramid's large size was made to protect against robbery, it may also be connected to a religious belief about the sun god, [[Ra]].<ref>Leonard Lesko pp. 4\u20135</ref>\n\nA majority of cemeteries were located on the west bank of the Nile, which was metaphorically viewed as \"the realm of the dead.\" The tomb was said to represent the deceased's place in the cosmos, which ultimately depended on the social class of the deceased. If the deceased was of a notably high-class, they were buried near the king, whereas middle and lower class individuals were simply buried near the communities in which they had lived.<ref name=\":5\"/> In many cases, the tombs of the high-class were situated in accordance with the tombs of the lower classes so that they would be viewed as a \"focal point.\" For example, one burial site was designed so that the tombs of the governors were placed alongside the slope of a hill, whereas the tombs of the governor's attendants were placed at the foot of the hill.<ref name=\":5\"/>\n\n==Coffins==\n[[File:Exhibit at Lovre Museum, Paris 01.jpg|thumb|Coffin of a mummy at Louvre, Paris]]\nAfter having been preserved, the mummy was placed into a coffin. Although the coffins that housed the deceased bodies were made simply of wood, they were intricately painted and designed to suit each individual. During the Old Kingdom, the following was included on each coffin: the title of the deceased, a list of offerings, a false compartment through which ka could pass through, and painted eyes so that the deceased could look through the coffin.<ref name=\":62\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.spurlock.illinois.edu/exhibits/online/mummification/artifacts6.html|title=Artifacts: Mummy Cases, Coffins, and Sarcophagi, Mummification, Online Exhibits, Exhibits, Spurlock Museum, U of I|website=www.spurlock.illinois.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-04-07}}</ref> The decorations on the coffin usually fit the deceased's status.\n\nDuring the Middle Kingdom, the coffin was treated as if it were a \"miniature tomb\" and was painted and inscribed like so. Goddesses Isis and Nephthys were painted on the coffins, and were said to guard the deceased in the afterlife. Along the sides of the coffins, the four sons of Horus were painted, amongst other gods. Prayers were often inscribed on the coffins as well.<ref name=\":62\" />\n\nAnthropoid coffins soon emerged, which were tailored to the contour of the deceased's body. The deceased's face and hair was painted onto the coffin so to personalize it further.<ref name=\":62\" /> A sarcophagus, which is a large, stone container, was used to house the coffin, and provide supplementary protection to the dead body. The Ancient Egyptians translated the word \"sarcophagus\" to mean \"possessor of life,\" and therefore, the sarcophagus would aid the deceased into the afterlife.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.historyembalmed.org/egyptian-mummies/sarcophagus.htm|title=Sarcophagus|website=www.historyembalmed.org|access-date=2018-04-07}}</ref>\n\n== Damnation ==\nOne of the funerary practices followed by the Egyptians was preparing properly for the afterlife. Ka, the vital force within the [[Ancient Egyptian concept of the soul]], would not return to the deceased body if embalming was not carried out in the proper fashion.<ref name=\":3\" /> In this case, the body decayed, and possibly became unrecognizable, which rendered the afterlife unattainable for the deceased person.<ref name=\":2\" /> If the proper precautions were not taken, damnation would occur.

Most funerary literature consists of lists of spells and instructions for navigating the afterlife. During the Old Kingdom, only the pharaoh had access to this material, which scholars refer to as the ''[[Pyramid Texts]]''. The Pyramid Texts are a collection of spells to assure the royal resurrection and protect the pharaoh from various malignant influences. The Pharaoh [[Unas]] was the first to use this collection of spells, as he and a few subsequent pharaohs had them carved on the walls of their [[pyramid]]s.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.digitalegypt.ucl.ac.uk/literature/religious/pyramid.html |title=Digital Egypt, Pyramid texts |access-date=2018-07-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140303120804/http://www.digitalegypt.ucl.ac.uk/literature/religious/pyramid.html |archive-date=2014-03-03 |url-status=dead }}</ref> These texts were individually chosen from a larger bank of spells.\n\nIn the [[First Intermediate Period]] and in the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]], some of the Pyramid Text spells also are found in burial chambers of high officials and on many coffins, where they begin to evolve into what scholars call the ''[[Coffin Texts]]''. In this period, the nobles and many non-royal Egyptians began to have access to funerary literature. Although many spells from the earlier texts were carried over, the new coffin texts also had additional spells, along with slight changes made to make this new funerary text more fit for the nobility.<ref name=\"Erik Hornung\">Erik Hornung, The Ancient Egyptian Book of the Afterlife, (Cornell: Cornell University Press, 1999) p. 7</ref>\n\nIn The [[New Kingdom]], the Coffin texts became the Book of the Dead, or the Funeral Papyri, and would last through the Late Kingdom. The text in these books was divided according to chapters/ spells, which were almost two-hundred in number. Each one of these texts was individualized for the deceased, though to varying degrees. If the person was rich enough, then they could commission their own personal version of the text that would include only the spells that they wanted. However, if one was not so wealthy, then one had to make do with the pre-made versions that had spaces left for the name of the deceased.\n\nIf the scribe ran out of room while doing the transcription, he would just stop the spell wherever he was and would not continue.<ref>Raymond O. Faulkner, The Ancient Egyptian [[Book of the Dead|Book of The Dead]], (New York, [[British Museum]] Publications, 1985) p. 11.</ref> It is not until the [[Twenty-sixth Dynasty of Egypt|Twenty-sixth Dynasty]] that there began to be any regulation of the order or even the number of spells that were to be included in the Book of the Dead.\nAt this time, the regulation is set at 192 spells to be placed in the book, with certain ones holding the same place at all times.<ref>Raymond O. Faulkner, The Ancient Egyptian Book of The Dead, (New York, British Museum Publications, 1985) p. 11.</ref> This makes it seem as if the order of the texts was not what was important, so the person could place them in an order that he was comfortable with, but rather that it was what was written that mattered.\n\n==Judgement==\nThe idea of judgement went as follows: in order to be considered for the admittance into the afterlife, those who died were obligated to undergo a multi-step judgement by certain gods.<ref name=\":5\"/> The concept and belief in judgement is outlined in the ''[[Book of the Dead]]'', a funerary text of the new kingdom. The Book of the Dead is composed of spells relating to the deceased and the afterlife. Spell 125, in particular, is understood to be delivered by the deceased at the outset of the judgement process.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nThe visual picture of what judgement looks like has been discovered through Ancient Egyptian ruins and artefacts. The procedure was depicted as follows: The deceased's heart was weighed in comparison to a feather, while a vicious beast awaited to eat the heart (if the deceased was found to be a sinner).<ref name=\":5\" /> [[Osiris]] was the judge (among others), and represented an ideal output of the judgement process for the deceased who entered his judgement hall. This is because he resurrected and regained his godly status after he was justified against his brother Seth, who wrongly murdered him.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Mark|first=Smith|date=2008-10-27|title=Osiris and the Deceased|url=https://escholarship.org/uc/item/29r70244|language=en|volume=1|issue=1}}</ref> The deceased pleaded to Osiris, among 42 judges, that they had not committed sin, which is known as a \"negative confession.\"<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe 42 judges assessed how virtuous the life of the deceased was, and this represented the principal element of the deceased entering the afterlife. After passing judgement, the family and friends of the deceased celebrated them and boasted about their righteousness to attain entry into the afterlife.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==Burial goods==\n[[File:Egyptian funerary figurines louvre 180flip.jpg|thumb|upright|A selection of shabti statues.]] \nAlthough the types of [[burial goods]] changed throughout ancient Egyptian history, their purpose to protect the deceased and provide sustenance in the afterlife remained.\n\nFrom the earliest periods of Egyptian history, all Egyptians were buried with at least some goods that they thought were necessary after death. At a minimum, these consisted of everyday objects such as bowls, combs, and other trinkets, along with food. Wealthier Egyptians could afford to be buried with jewelry, furniture, and other valuables, which made them targets of tomb robbers. In the early Dynastic Period, tombs were filled with daily life objects, such as furniture, jewelry and other valuables. They also contained many stone and pottery vessels.<ref>Grajetzki, ''Burial Customs'', pp. 7\u201314</ref>\n\nAs burial customs developed in the Old Kingdom, wealthy citizens were buried in wooden or stone coffins. However, the number of burial goods declined. They were often just a set of copper models, tools and vessels.<ref>Grajetzki, ''Burial Customs'', pp. 15\u201326</ref> Starting in the First Intermediate period, [[Wooden tomb model|wooden models]] became very popular burial goods. These wooden models often depict everyday activities that the deceased expected to continue doing in the afterlife. Also, a type of rectangular [[coffin]] became the standard, being brightly painted and often including an [[Ancient Egyptian offering formula|offering formula]]. Objects of daily use were not often included in the tombs during this period.\n\n[[File:Egyptian - Heart Scarab of Bak-en-Djehuti - Walters 42380 - Back.jpg|thumb|left|The ancient Egyptians put green stone scarab beetles into the coffins of important people, along with the mummified bodies.]]\nAt the end of the Middle Kingdom, new object types were introduced into burials, such as the first shabtis and the first heart scarabs. [[ushabti|Shabtis]] were little clay statues made to perform tasks on command for the pharaoh. Now objects of daily use appear in tombs again, often magical items already employed for protecting the living. Scarabs (beetles) collect animal dung and roll it into little balls. To the Egyptians, these balls looked like the life-giving Sun, so they hoped that scarabs would bring them long life. [[scarab (artifact)|Scarabs]] have been found in tombs and graves.<ref>{{cite book|author=Starry Dog|title=Biggest Ever Book of Questions & Answers|year=2003|publisher=WS PACIFIC PUBLICATIONS, INC|isbn=978-1-4454-8792-2|pages=71|chapter=History: Ancient Egypt}}</ref>\n\nIn the New Kingdom, some of the old burial customs changed. For example, an anthropoid coffin shape became standardized, and the deceased were provided with a small shabti statue, which the Egyptians believed would perform work for them in the afterlife. Elite burials were often filled with objects of daily use. Under [[Ramesses II|Ramses II]] and later all daily life objects disappear from tombs. They most often only contained a selection of items especially made for the burial. Also, in later burials, the numbers of shabti statues increased; in some burials, numbering more than four hundred statues. In addition to these shabti statues, the deceased could be buried with many different types of magical figurines to protect them from harm.\n\n== Funerary Boats ==\nFunerary boats were a part of some ancient Egyptian burials.<ref>Mary Ann Sullivan, [https://www.bluffton.edu/~sullivanm/egypt/giza/boat/boat.html ''Solar Boat/Funerary Boat of Cheops (Khufu)''], \u00a9 2001. Retrieved May 9, 2013.</ref> Boats played a major role in Egyptian religion because they were conceived as the main means by which the gods traveled across the sky and through to the netherworld. One type of boat used at funerals was for making pilgrimages to holy sites such as [[Abydos, Egypt|Abydos]]. A large funerary boat, for example, was found near the pyramid of the Old Kingdom [[Khufu|Pharaoh Cheops]]. The funerary boats are called [[Felucca]] and they were usually made of wood; the Egyptians used a collection of papyrus reeds and tied them together with the wood very tightly.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dkfindout.com/us/history/ancient-egypt/ancient-egyptian-boats/|title=DK Find Out! {{!}} Fun Facts for Kids on Animals, Earth, History and more!|website=DK Find Out!|language=en|access-date=2017-11-17}}</ref> The most common route for funerary boats was the River Nile to the afterlife. The boat carried the coffin and often had a dog in the boat since they believed a dog would lead the deceased to the afterlife.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://australianmuseum.net.au/image/ancient-egyptian-model-funerary-boat|title=Ancient Egyptian model funerary boat - Australian Museum|website=australianmuseum.net.au|language=en|access-date=2017-11-17}}</ref> The boats usually measured about 20 feet or longer. These however didn't match those of the great pharaohs like Pharaoh Khufu (who built the Great Pyramid.) His funerary boat was approximately 144 foot long with 12 oars. Common funerary boats were smaller sized with few oars.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://classroom.synonym.com/ancient-egypt-funeral-boats-6445.html|title=Facts of Ancient Egypt Funeral Boats {{!}} Synonym|access-date=2017-11-17|language=en}}</ref>\n\n== Role of Animals ==\nSeveral kinds of animal remains have been discovered in tombs all around Dayr al-Barsha, a Coptic village in Middle Egypt. The remains found in the shafts and burial chambers included dogs, foxes, eagle owls, bats, rodents, and snakes. These were determined to be individuals that had entered the deposits by accident. Other animal remains that were found were more common and recurred more than those individuals that wound up accidentally trapped in these tombs. These remains included numerous gazelle and cattle bones, as well as calves and goats which were believed to have been in result of human behavior. This was due to finding that some remains had fragments altered, missing, or separated from their original skeletons. These remains also had traces of paint and cut marks on them, seen especially with cattle skulls and feet. Based on this, the natural environment of the Dayr al-Barsha tombs, and the fact that only some parts of these animals were found, the possibility of natural deposition can be ruled out, and the cause of these remains in fact are most likely caused by animal sacrifices, as only the head, foreleg, and feet were apparently selected for deposition within the tombs. According to a study by Christopher Eyre, cattle meat was actually not a part of the daily diet in Ancient Egypt, as the consumption of meat only took place during celebrations including funerary and mortuary rituals, and the practice of providing the deceased with offerings of cattle going back to the Predynastic Period.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=De Meyer|first1=Marleen|last2=Van Neer|first2=Wim|last3=Peeters|first3=Christoph|last4=Willems|first4=Harco|title=The Role of Animals in the Funerary Rites at Dayr al-Barsh\u0101|journal=Journal of the American Research Center in Egypt|date=2005|volume=42|pages=45\u201371|jstor=27651798}}</ref>\n\n==Ancient Egyptian mummification and funeral in fiction==\n* [[Boles\u0142aw Prus]], ''[[Pharaoh (novel)|Pharaoh]]'' (1895), depicts the whole process of mummification and funeral at the fall of the [[20th Dynasty]] and [[New Kingdom]].\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Ancient Egypt}}\n* [[Death and afterlife in Ancient Egypt]]\n* [[Mummy#Egyptian mummies|Egyptian mummies]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n* Allen, James P.
