As the designation and numbering of these highways were coordinated among the states, they are sometimes called '''Federal Highways''', but the roadways were built and have always been maintained by [[State governments of the United States|state]] or [[Local government in the United States|local governments]] since their initial designation in 1926.\n\nThe route numbers and locations are coordinated by the [[American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials]] (AASHTO).<ref name=\"AASHTO purpose\"/> The only federal involvement in AASHTO is a nonvoting seat for the [[United States Department of Transportation]].<!-- The Interstate Highway System has a different numbering scheme with different directions. Do not confuse the two and change the following information. --> Generally, most north-to-south highways are odd-numbered, with the lowest numbers in the east, and the highest in the west. Similarly, east-to-west highways are typically even-numbered, with the lowest numbers in the north, and the highest in the south. Some exceptions exist, however, such as spur routes. Major north\u2013south routes have numbers ending in \"1\" or \"5\", while major east\u2013west routes have numbers ending in \"0\".<ref name=\"FHWA planning\" /> Three-digit numbered highways are generally spur routes of parent highways (thus [[U.S. Route 264]] [US&nbsp;264] is a spur off [[U.S. Route 64|US&nbsp;64]]). Some [[List of divided U.S. Routes|divided routes]] (such as [[U.S. Route 19E|US&nbsp;19E]] and [[U.S. Route 19W|US&nbsp;19W]]) exist to provide two alignments for one route. Special routes, which can be labeled as alternate, bypass or business, depending on the intended use, provide a parallel routing to the mainline U.S. Highway.\n\nBefore the U.S. Routes were designated, [[auto trail]]s designated by auto trail associations were the main means of marking roads through the United States.  In 1925, the '''Joint Board on Interstate Highways''', recommended by the [[American Association of State Highway Officials]] (AASHO), worked to form a national numbering system to rationalize the roads. After several meetings, a final report was approved by the [[United States Department of Agriculture|U.S. Department of Agriculture]] in November 1925. They received complaints from across the country about the assignment of routes, so the board made several modifications; the U.S. Highway System was approved on November 11, 1926. As a result of compromises made to get the U.S. Highway System approved, many routes were divided, with alignments to serve different towns. In subsequent years, AASHTO called for such splits to be eliminated.\n\nExpansion of the U.S. Highway System continued until 1956, when the [[Interstate Highway System]] was laid out and began construction under the administration of President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]. After construction was completed, many U.S. Routes were replaced by Interstate Highways for through traffic. Despite the Interstate System, U.S. Highways still form many important regional connections, and new routes are still being added.\n\n==System details==\n{{See also|List of United States Numbered Highways}}\n\nIn general, U.S. Routes do not have a minimum design standard, unlike the later [[Interstate Highway]]s, and are not usually built to [[freeway]] standards. Some stretches of U.S. Routes do meet those standards. Many are designated using the [[main street]]s of the cities and towns through which they run. New additions to the system, however, must \"substantially meet the current [[AASHTO design standards]]\".<ref name=\"AASHTO purpose\">{{cite web |url=http://route.transportation.org/Documents/HO1_Policy_Establ_Develop_USRN.pdf |title=Establishment and Development of United States Numbered Highways |date=January 2000 |author=American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials |publisher=AASHTO |format=PDF |work=AASHTO Transportation Policy Book |authorlink=American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials |accessdate=January 16, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141022063759/http://route.transportation.org/Documents/HO1_Policy_Establ_Develop_USRN.pdf |archivedate=October 22, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> As of 1989, the United States Numbered Highways system had a total length of {{convert|157724|mi|km}}.<ref name=USRN/>\n\nExcept for [[toll bridge]]s and [[toll tunnel|tunnels]], very few U.S. Routes are [[toll road]]s.

Usually, one- and two-digit routes are major routes, and three-digit routes are numbered as shorter spur routes from a main route (with some exceptions such as [[US 151]], which is a main line highway). Odd numbers generally increase from east to west; [[U.S. Route 1]] (US&nbsp;1) follows the Atlantic Coast and [[U.S. Route 101|US&nbsp;101]] follows the Pacific Coast. (US 101 is one of the many exceptions to the standard numbering grid; its first \"digit\" is \"10\", and it is a main route on its own and not a spur of US 1.) Even numbers tend to increase from north to south; [[U.S. Route 2|US&nbsp;2]] closely follows the Canadian border, and [[U.S. Route 98|US&nbsp;98]] hugs the Gulf Coast. The longest routes connecting major cities are generally numbered to end in a 1 or a 0,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/longest.cfm |title=Ask the Rambler: What Is The Longest Road in the United States? |publisher=[[Federal Highway Administration]] |date= April 7, 2011 |accessdate=April 11, 2010}}</ref> however extensions and truncations have made this distinction largely meaningless. <ref name=\"mcnichol71\">{{cite book |last=McNichol |first=Dan |title=The Roads that Built America: The Incredible Story of the US Interstate System |location=New York |publisher=Sterling Publishing |year=2006 |isbn= 1-4027-3468-9|ref=harv |page=71}}</ref>  These guidelines are very rough, and exceptions to all of the basic numbering rules exist all over the U.S. and are too numerous to list.\n\nIn the 1950s, the numbering grid for the new Interstate Highway System was established as intentionally opposite from the US grid insofar as the direction the route numbers increase.

Often, the shield is displayed against a black square or rectangular background.  Each state manufactures their own signage, and as such subtle variations exist all across the United States.  Individual states may use cut-out or rectangular designs, some have black outlines, and California prints the letters \"US\" above the numerals.  One- and two-digit shields generally feature the same large, bold numerals on a square-dimension shield, while 3-digit routes may either use the same shield with a narrower font, or a wider rectangular-dimension shield.  Special routes may be indicated with a banner above the route number, or with a letter suffixed to the route number.  Signs are generally displayed in several different locations.  First, they are shown along the side of the route at regular intervals or after major intersections (called [[reassurance marker]]s), which shows the route and the nominal direction of travel.  Second, they are displayed at intersections with other major roads, so that intersecting traffic can follow their chosen course.  Third, they can be displayed on large green [[Road_signs_in_the_United_States#Guide|guide signs]] that indicate upcoming interchanges on freeways and expressways.\n\n<gallery caption = \"Various U.S. highway sign designs\">\nFile:US 64.svg|Most commonly used one- or two-digit variant, standard shield on a black square\nFile:US 302 square.svg|Three-digit variant, square proportions and thin font\nFile:US 180.svg|Three-digit variant, rectangular proportions and standard font\nFile:US 140 (1948).svg|Outline variant\nFile:US 95 (1961 cutout).svg|California variant, with US at top and black outline\nFile:US 92 (FL).svg|Florida variant, in color, now retired\nFile:US 101 California 1926.svg|Historic design, with state name and US on shield, block-style font, now retired\nFile:US 14A.svg|Alternate route, with full-size letter suffix\nFile:US 62B.svg|Business route, with small letter suffix\nFile:US 64-A.svg|Alternate route, with hyphen and full-size letter suffix\nFile:US 1 Bypass.svg|Bypass route, with \"BY-PASS\" written in the shield\nFile:US 129 Alternate.svg|Alternate route, with \"ALT\" written in the shield\nFile:US 50 Alt.svg|Alternate route, with \"ALT\" written in a banner above shield\nFile:US 87 Business.svg|Business route, with \"BUSINESS\" written in a banner above shield\n</gallery>\n\n===Divided and special routes===\n{{Main|List of divided U.S. Routes|List of special routes of the United States Numbered Highway System}}\n\nSince 1926, some divided routes were designated to serve related areas, and designate roughly-equivalent splits of routes.

The [[Federal Aid Highway Act of 1921 (Phipps Act)|Federal Aid Highway Act of 1921]] limited the routes to 7% of each state's roads, while 3 in every 7 roads had to be \"interstate in character\".  Identification of these main roads was completed in 1923.<!--anyone got a map of them?--><ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>\n\nThe [[American Association of State Highway Officials]] (AASHO), formed in 1914 to help establish roadway standards, began to plan a system of marked and numbered \"interstate highways\" at its 1924 meeting.<ref>{{harvp|ps=.|McNichol|2006|p=67}}</ref> AASHO recommended that the [[Secretary of Agriculture (US)|Secretary of Agriculture]] work with the states to designate these routes.<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>\n\nSecretary [[Howard M.

The Board was composed of 21 state highway officials and three federal [[Bureau of Public Roads]] officials.  At the first meeting, on April 20 and 21, the group chose the name \"U.S. Highway\" as the designation for the routes. They decided that the system would not be limited to the federal-aid network; if the best route did not receive federal funds, it would still be included.  The tentative design for the [[U.S. Highway shield]] was also chosen,<ref>{{harvp|ps=.|McNichol|2006|p=121}}</ref> based on the shield found on the [[Great Seal of the United States]].<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>\n\nThe auto trail associations rejected the elimination of the highway names.

At that meeting, discussion was held over the appropriate density of routes. [[William F. Williams]] of [[Massachusetts]] and [[Frederick S. Greene]] of New York favored a system of only major transcontinental highways, while many states recommended a large number of roads of only regional importance.  Greene in particular intended New York's system to have four major through routes<!--2 and 4 ended at 9, he wanted 109 gone--> as an example to the other states.  Many states agreed in general with the scope of the system, but believed the [[Midwest (US)|Midwest]] to have added too many routes to the system.  The group adopted the shield, with few modifications from the original sketch, at that meeting, as well as the decision to number rather than name the routes.  A preliminary numbering system, with eight major east\u2013west and ten major north\u2013south routes, was deferred to a numbering committee \"without instructions\".<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>\n\nAfter working with states to get their approval, the committee expanded the highway system to 75,800 miles (122,000&nbsp;km), or 2.6% of total mileage, over 50% more than the plan approved August 4.  The skeleton of the numbering plan was suggested on August 27 by [[Edwin Warley James]] of the BPR, who matched [[parity (number)|parity]] to direction, and laid out a rough grid.  Major routes from the earlier map were assigned numbers ending in 0, 1 or 5 (5 was soon relegated to less-major status), and short connections received three-digit numbers based on the main highway from which they spurred.  The five-man committee met September 25, and submitted the final report to the Joint Board secretary on October 26.<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>  The board sent the report to the Secretary of Agriculture of October 30, and he approved it November 18, 1925.<ref name=\"1925 list\">{{cite book |type= Report |author = Joint Board on Interstate Highways |year = 1925 |url = https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Report_of_Joint_Board_on_Interstate_Highways_October_30,_1925 |title = Report of Joint Board on Interstate Highways, October 30, 1925, Approved by the Secretary of Agriculture, November 18, 1925 |location= Washington, DC |publisher= [[United States Department of Agriculture]] |id= {{OCLC|733875457|55123355|71026428}} |via = [[Wikisource]] |access-date = November 14, 2017 }}</ref>\n\n===Disagreement and refinement, 1925\u201326===\n[[File: United States System of Highways Adopted for Uniform Marking by the American Association of State Highway Officials.jpg|thumb|The \"final\" U.S. Highway plan as approved November 11, 1926]]\n\nThe new system was both praised and criticized by local newspapers, often depending on whether that city was connected to a major route.  While the [[Lincoln Highway Association]] understood and supported the plan, partly because they were assured of getting the [[U.S. Route 30|US&nbsp;30]] designation as much as possible, most other trail associations lamented their obsolescence.  At their January 14\u201315, 1926 meeting, AASHO was flooded with complaints.<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>\n\nIn the Northeast, New York held out for fewer routes designated as US highways. The Pennsylvania representative, who had not attended the local meetings, convinced AASHO to add a dense network of routes, which had the effect of giving six routes termini along the state line.  (Only [[U.S. Route 220|US&nbsp;220]] still ends near the state line, and now it ends at an intersection with future [[Interstate 86 in New York|I-86]].)  Because [[U.S. Route 20|US&nbsp;20]] seemed indirect, passing through [[Yellowstone National Park]], [[Idaho]] and [[Oregon]] requested that [[U.S. Route 30|US&nbsp;30]] be swapped with US&nbsp;20 to the [[Pacific coast]].<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>\n\nMany local disputes arose related to the committee's choices between designation of two roughly equal parallel routes, which were often competing auto trails.  At their January meeting, AASHO approved the first two of many split routes (specifically [[U.S. Route 40|US&nbsp;40]] between [[Manhattan, Kansas]] and [[Limon, Colorado]] and [[U.S. Route 50|US&nbsp;50]] between [[Baldwin City, Kansas]] and [[Garden City, Kansas]]).  In effect, each of the two routes received the same number, with a directional suffix indicating its relation to the other.  These splits were initially shown in the log as\u2014for instance\u2014US&nbsp;40 North and US&nbsp;40 South, but were always posted as simply US&nbsp;40N and US&nbsp;40S.<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>\n\nThe most heated argument, however, was the issue of US&nbsp;60.  The Joint Board had assigned that number to the Chicago-Los Angeles route, which ran more north\u2013south than west\u2013east in Illinois, and then angled sharply to the southwest to [[Oklahoma City]], from where it ran west to [[Los Angeles]]. [[Kentucky]] strongly objected to this designated route, as it had been left off any of the major east-west routes, instead receiving the [[U.S. Route 62 (1925)|US&nbsp;62]] designation. In January 1926, the committee designated this, along with the part of [[U.S. Route 52|US&nbsp;52]] east of [[Ashland, Kentucky]], as [[U.S. Route 60|US&nbsp;60]]. They assigned US&nbsp;62 to the Chicago-Los Angeles route, contingent on the approval of the states along the former US&nbsp;60.  But Missouri and Oklahoma did object\u2014Missouri had already printed maps, and Oklahoma had prepared signs.  A compromise was proposed, in which US&nbsp;60 would split at [[Springfield, Missouri]], into US&nbsp;60E and US&nbsp;60N, but both sides objected.  The final solution resulted in the assignment of [[U.S. Route 66|US&nbsp;66]] to the Chicago-Los Angeles portion of the US highway, which did not end in zero, but was still seen as a satisfyingly round number.<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/> Route 66 came to have a prominent place in popular culture, being featured in song and films.\n\nWith 32&nbsp;states already marking their routes, the plan was approved by AASHO on November 11, 1926.<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>  This plan included a number of directionally split routes, several discontinuous routes (including [[U.S. Route 6|US&nbsp;6]], [[U.S. Route 19|US&nbsp;19]] and [[U.S. Route 50|US&nbsp;50]]), and some termini at state lines.<ref name=\"1926 map\">{{cite map |author1= [[Bureau of Public Roads]] |author2= [[American Association of State Highway Officials]] |date= November 11, 1926 |title= United States System of Highways Adopted for Uniform Marking by the American Association of State Highway Officials |url= https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:United_States_System_of_Highways_Adopted_for_Uniform_Marking_by_the_American_Association_of_State_Highway_Officials.jpg |scale= 1:7,000,000 |location= Washington, DC |publisher= [[United States Geological Survey]] |oclc= 32889555 |accessdate= November 7, 2013 |via= [[Wikimedia Commons]] |last-author-amp= yes}}</ref>  By the time the first route log was published in April 1927, major numbering changes had been made in Pennsylvania in order to align the routes to the existing auto trails.<ref name=\"FHWA PA\">{{cite web |last= Weingroff |first=Richard F. |url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/us22.cfm |title=US&nbsp;22: The William Penn Highway |publisher=Federal Highway Administration |work=Highway History |date=April 7, 2011 |accessdate=June 9, 2011}}</ref> In addition, [[U.S. Route 15]] had been extended across [[Virginia]].<ref name=\"1927 log\">{{cite journal |title=United States Numbered Highways |journal=[[American Highways]] |publisher=American Association of State Highway Officials |date=April 1927 |issn= 0002-8746}}</ref>\n\nMuch of the early criticism of the U.S. Highway System focused on the choice of numbers to designate the highways, rather than names.  Some thought a numbered highway system to be cold  compared to the more colorful names and historic value of the auto trail systems.  ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote, \"The traveler may shed tears as he drives the [[Lincoln Highway]] or dream dreams as he speeds over the [[Jefferson Highway]], but how can he get a 'kick' out of 46, 55 or 33 or 21?\"<ref>{{harvp|ps=.|McNichol|2006|p=78}}</ref> (A popular song later promised, \"Get your kicks on Route 66!\") The writer [[Ernest McGaffey]] was quoted as saying, \"Logarithms will take the place of legends, and 'hokum' for history.\"<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>\n\n===Expansion and adjustment, 1926\u201356===\n[[File:Highway Sign.jpg|thumb|This sign, photographed in 1941 on US&nbsp;99 between [[Seattle|Seattle, Washington]], and [[Portland, Oregon]], illustrates one rationale for a federal highway system: national defense.]]\n\nWhen the U.S. numbered system was started in 1925, a few optional routings were established which were designated with a suffixed letter after the number indicating \"north\", \"south\", \"east\", or \"west\". While a few roads in the system are still numbered in this manner, AASHO believes that they should be eliminated wherever possible, by the absorption of one of the optional routes into another route.\n\nIn 1934, AASHO tried to eliminate many of the split routes by removing them from the log, and designating one of each pair as a three-digit or alternate route, or in one case [[U.S. Route 37|US&nbsp;37]]. AASHO described its renumbering concept in the October 1934 issue of ''[[American Highways]]'':<ref name=\"FHWA US 11\"/>\n<blockquote>\"Wherever an alternate route is not suitable for its own unique two-digit designation, standard procedure assigns the unqualified number to the older or shorter route, while the other route uses the same number marked by a standard strip above its shield carrying the word 'Alternate'.\"</blockquote>Most states adhere to this approach. However, some maintain legacy routes that violate the rules in various ways.  Examples can be found in [[California]], [[Mississippi]], [[Nebraska]], [[Oregon]], and [[Tennessee]]. In 1952, AASHO permanently recognized the splits in [[U.S. Route 11|US&nbsp;11]],<ref name=\"FHWA US 11\"/> [[U.S. Route 19|US&nbsp;19]], [[U.S. Route 25|US&nbsp;25]], [[U.S. Route 31|US&nbsp;31]], [[U.S. Route 45|US&nbsp;45]], [[U.S. Route 49|US&nbsp;49]], [[U.S. Route 73|US&nbsp;73]], and [[U.S. Route 99|US&nbsp;99]].<ref name=\"FHWA US 11\"/>\n\nFor the most part, the U.S. Routes were the primary means of inter-city vehicle travel; the main exceptions were [[toll road]]s such as the [[Pennsylvania Turnpike]] and [[parkway]] routes such as the [[Merritt Parkway]].

By 1957, AASHO had decided to assign a new grid to the new routes, to be numbered in the opposite directions as the U.S. Highway grid. Though the Interstate numbers were to supplement, rather than replace, the U.S. Route numbers, in many cases (especially in the [[West (US)|west]]) the US highways were rerouted along the new Interstates.<ref name=\"esso\"/> Major decommissioning of former routes began with [[California]]'s [[1964 renumbering (California)|highway renumbering in 1964]].

As the designation and numbering of these highways were coordinated among the states, they are sometimes called '''Federal Highways''', but the roadways were built and have always been maintained by [[State governments of the United States|state]] or [[Local government in the United States|local governments]] since their initial designation in 1926.\n\nThe route numbers and locations are coordinated by the [[American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials]] (AASHTO).<ref name=\"AASHTO purpose\"/> The only federal involvement in AASHTO is a nonvoting seat for the [[United States Department of Transportation]].<!-- The Interstate Highway System has a different numbering scheme with different directions. Do not confuse the two and change the following information. --> Generally, most north-to-south highways are odd-numbered, with the lowest numbers in the east, and the highest in the west. Similarly, east-to-west highways are typically even-numbered, with the lowest numbers in the north, and the highest in the south. Some exceptions exist, however, such as spur routes. Major north\u2013south routes have numbers ending in \"1\" or \"5\", while major east\u2013west routes have numbers ending in \"0\".<ref name=\"FHWA planning\" /> Three-digit numbered highways are generally spur routes of parent highways (thus [[U.S. Route 264]] [US&nbsp;264] is a spur off [[U.S. Route 64|US&nbsp;64]]). Some [[List of divided U.S. Routes|divided routes]] (such as [[U.S. Route 19E|US&nbsp;19E]] and [[U.S. Route 19W|US&nbsp;19W]]) exist to provide two alignments for one route. Special routes, which can be labeled as alternate, bypass or business, depending on the intended use, provide a parallel routing to the mainline U.S. Highway.\n\nBefore the U.S. Routes were designated, [[auto trail]]s designated by auto trail associations were the main means of marking roads through the United States.  In 1925, the '''Joint Board on Interstate Highways''', recommended by the [[American Association of State Highway Officials]] (AASHO), worked to form a national numbering system to rationalize the roads. After several meetings, a final report was approved by the [[United States Department of Agriculture|U.S. Department of Agriculture]] in November 1925. They received complaints from across the country about the assignment of routes, so the board made several modifications; the U.S. Highway System was approved on November 11, 1926. As a result of compromises made to get the U.S. Highway System approved, many routes were divided, with alignments to serve different towns. In subsequent years, AASHTO called for such splits to be eliminated.\n\nExpansion of the U.S. Highway System continued until 1956, when the [[Interstate Highway System]] was laid out and began construction under the administration of President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]. After construction was completed, many U.S. Routes were replaced by Interstate Highways for through traffic. Despite the Interstate System, U.S. Highways still form many important regional connections, and new routes are still being added.\n\n==System details==\n{{See also|List of United States Numbered Highways}}\n\nIn general, U.S. Routes do not have a minimum design standard, unlike the later [[Interstate Highway]]s, and are not usually built to [[freeway]] standards. Some stretches of U.S. Routes do meet those standards. Many are designated using the [[main street]]s of the cities and towns through which they run. New additions to the system, however, must \"substantially meet the current [[AASHTO design standards]]\".<ref name=\"AASHTO purpose\">{{cite web |url=http://route.transportation.org/Documents/HO1_Policy_Establ_Develop_USRN.pdf |title=Establishment and Development of United States Numbered Highways |date=January 2000 |author=American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials |publisher=AASHTO |format=PDF |work=AASHTO Transportation Policy Book |authorlink=American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials |accessdate=January 16, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141022063759/http://route.transportation.org/Documents/HO1_Policy_Establ_Develop_USRN.pdf |archivedate=October 22, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> As of 1989, the United States Numbered Highways system had a total length of {{convert|157724|mi|km}}.<ref name=USRN/>\n\nExcept for [[toll bridge]]s and [[toll tunnel|tunnels]], very few U.S. Routes are [[toll road]]s.

Odd numbers generally increase from east to west; [[U.S. Route 1]] (US&nbsp;1) follows the Atlantic Coast and [[U.S. Route 101|US&nbsp;101]] follows the Pacific Coast. (US 101 is one of the many exceptions to the standard numbering grid; its first \"digit\" is \"10\", and it is a main route on its own and not a spur of US 1.) Even numbers tend to increase from north to south; [[U.S. Route 2|US&nbsp;2]] closely follows the Canadian border, and [[U.S. Route 98|US&nbsp;98]] hugs the Gulf Coast. The longest routes connecting major cities are generally numbered to end in a 1 or a 0,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/longest.cfm |title=Ask the Rambler: What Is The Longest Road in the United States? |publisher=[[Federal Highway Administration]] |date= April 7, 2011 |accessdate=April 11, 2010}}</ref> however extensions and truncations have made this distinction largely meaningless. <ref name=\"mcnichol71\">{{cite book |last=McNichol |first=Dan |title=The Roads that Built America: The Incredible Story of the US Interstate System |location=New York |publisher=Sterling Publishing |year=2006 |isbn= 1-4027-3468-9|ref=harv |page=71}}</ref>  These guidelines are very rough, and exceptions to all of the basic numbering rules exist all over the U.S. and are too numerous to list.\n\nIn the 1950s, the numbering grid for the new Interstate Highway System was established as intentionally opposite from the US grid insofar as the direction the route numbers increase.

Individual states may use cut-out or rectangular designs, some have black outlines, and California prints the letters \"US\" above the numerals.  One- and two-digit shields generally feature the same large, bold numerals on a square-dimension shield, while 3-digit routes may either use the same shield with a narrower font, or a wider rectangular-dimension shield.  Special routes may be indicated with a banner above the route number, or with a letter suffixed to the route number.  Signs are generally displayed in several different locations.  First, they are shown along the side of the route at regular intervals or after major intersections (called [[reassurance marker]]s), which shows the route and the nominal direction of travel.  Second, they are displayed at intersections with other major roads, so that intersecting traffic can follow their chosen course.  Third, they can be displayed on large green [[Road_signs_in_the_United_States#Guide|guide signs]] that indicate upcoming interchanges on freeways and expressways.\n\n<gallery caption = \"Various U.S. highway sign designs\">\nFile:US 64.svg|Most commonly used one- or two-digit variant, standard shield on a black square\nFile:US 302 square.svg|Three-digit variant, square proportions and thin font\nFile:US 180.svg|Three-digit variant, rectangular proportions and standard font\nFile:US 40 (1948).svg|Outline variant\nFile:US 95 (1961 cutout).svg|California variant, with US at top and black outline\nFile:US 92 (FL).svg|Florida variant, in color, now retired\nFile:US 101 California 1926.svg|Historic design, with state name and US on shield, block-style font, now retired\nFile:US 14A.svg|Alternate route, with full-size letter suffix\nFile:US 62B.svg|Business route, with small letter suffix\nFile:US 64-A.svg|Alternate route, with hyphen and full-size letter suffix\nFile:US 1 Bypass.svg|Bypass route, with \"BY-PASS\" written in the shield\nFile:US 129 Alternate.svg|Alternate route, with \"ALT\" written in the shield\nFile:US 50 Alt.svg|Alternate route, with \"ALT\" written in a banner above shield\nFile:US 87 Business.svg|Business route, with \"BUSINESS\" written in a banner above shield\n</gallery>\n\n===Divided and special routes===\n{{Main|List of divided U.S. Routes|List of special routes of the United States Numbered Highway System}}\n\nSince 1926, some divided routes were designated to serve related areas, and designate roughly-equivalent splits of routes.

The [[Federal Aid Highway Act of 1921 (Phipps Act)|Federal Aid Highway Act of 1921]] limited the routes to 7% of each state's roads, while 3 in every 7 roads had to be \"interstate in character\".  Identification of these main roads was completed in 1923.<!--anyone got a map of them?--><ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>\n\nThe [[American Association of State Highway Officials]] (AASHO), formed in 1914 to help establish roadway standards, began to plan a system of marked and numbered \"interstate highways\" at its 1924 meeting.<ref>{{harvp|ps=.|McNichol|2006|p=67}}</ref> AASHO recommended that the [[Secretary of Agriculture (US)|Secretary of Agriculture]] work with the states to designate these routes.<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>\n\nSecretary [[Howard M. Gore]] appointed the ''Joint Board on Interstate Highways'', as recommended by AASHO, on March 2, 1925.  The Board was composed of 21 state highway officials and three federal [[Bureau of Public Roads]] officials.  At the first meeting, on April 20 and 21, the group chose the name \"U.S. Highway\" as the designation for the routes. They decided that the system would not be limited to the federal-aid network; if the best route did not receive federal funds, it would still be included.  The tentative design for the [[U.S. Highway shield]] was also chosen,<ref>{{harvp|ps=.|McNichol|2006|p=121}}</ref> based on the shield found on the [[Great Seal of the United States]].<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>\n\nThe auto trail associations rejected the elimination of the highway names.

Representatives of the auto trail associations were not able to formally address the meetings.  However, as a compromise, they talked with the Joint Board members. The associations finally settled on a general agreement with the numbering plans, as named trails would still be included.<!--could be worded better-->  The tentative system added up to 81,000 miles (130,000&nbsp;km), 2.8% of the public road mileage at the time.<!--seems high even then&nbsp;\u2014 maybe state highways only?--><ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>\n\n{{multiple image\n|align= right\n|direction= horizontal\n|width= 100\n|image1= US 32 Iowa 1926.svg\n|alt1= US 32 Iowa 1926 shield marker\n|image2= US 28 Oregon 1948.svg\n|alt2= US 28 Oregon 1948 shield marker\n|footer= 1926 and 1948 versions of the [[U.S. Route shield]]\n}}\nThe second full meeting was held August 3 and 4, 1925.  At that meeting, discussion was held over the appropriate density of routes. [[William F. Williams]] of [[Massachusetts]] and [[Frederick S. Greene]] of New York favored a system of only major transcontinental highways, while many states recommended a large number of roads of only regional importance.  Greene in particular intended New York's system to have four major through routes<!--2 and 4 ended at 9, he wanted 109 gone--> as an example to the other states.  Many states agreed in general with the scope of the system, but believed the [[Midwest (US)|Midwest]] to have added too many routes to the system.  The group adopted the shield, with few modifications from the original sketch, at that meeting, as well as the decision to number rather than name the routes.  A preliminary numbering system, with eight major east\u2013west and ten major north\u2013south routes, was deferred to a numbering committee \"without instructions\".<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>\n\nAfter working with states to get their approval, the committee expanded the highway system to 75,800 miles (122,000&nbsp;km), or 2.6% of total mileage, over 50% more than the plan approved August 4.  The skeleton of the numbering plan was suggested on August 27 by [[Edwin Warley James]] of the BPR, who matched [[parity (number)|parity]] to direction, and laid out a rough grid.  Major routes from the earlier map were assigned numbers ending in 0, 1 or 5 (5 was soon relegated to less-major status), and short connections received three-digit numbers based on the main highway from which they spurred.  The five-man committee met September 25, and submitted the final report to the Joint Board secretary on October 26.<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>  The board sent the report to the Secretary of Agriculture of October 30, and he approved it November 18, 1925.<ref name=\"1925 list\">{{cite book |type= Report |author = Joint Board on Interstate Highways |year = 1925 |url = https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Report_of_Joint_Board_on_Interstate_Highways_October_30,_1925 |title = Report of Joint Board on Interstate Highways, October 30, 1925, Approved by the Secretary of Agriculture, November 18, 1925 |location= Washington, DC |publisher= [[United States Department of Agriculture]] |id= {{OCLC|733875457|55123355|71026428}} |via = [[Wikisource]] |access-date = November 14, 2017 }}</ref>\n\n===Disagreement and refinement, 1925\u201326===\n[[File: United States System of Highways Adopted for Uniform Marking by the American Association of State Highway Officials.jpg|thumb|The \"final\" U.S. Highway plan as approved November 11, 1926]]\n\nThe new system was both praised and criticized by local newspapers, often depending on whether that city was connected to a major route.  While the [[Lincoln Highway Association]] understood and supported the plan, partly because they were assured of getting the [[U.S. Route 30|US&nbsp;30]] designation as much as possible, most other trail associations lamented their obsolescence.  At their January 14\u201315, 1926 meeting, AASHO was flooded with complaints.<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>\n\nIn the Northeast, New York held out for fewer routes designated as US highways. The Pennsylvania representative, who had not attended the local meetings, convinced AASHO to add a dense network of routes, which had the effect of giving six routes termini along the state line.  (Only [[U.S. Route 220|US&nbsp;220]] still ends near the state line, and now it ends at an intersection with future [[Interstate 86 in New York|I-86]].)  Because [[U.S. Route 20|US&nbsp;20]] seemed indirect, passing through [[Yellowstone National Park]], [[Idaho]] and [[Oregon]] requested that [[U.S. Route 30|US&nbsp;30]] be swapped with US&nbsp;20 to the [[Pacific coast]].<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>\n\nMany local disputes arose related to the committee's choices between designation of two roughly equal parallel routes, which were often competing auto trails.  At their January meeting, AASHO approved the first two of many split routes (specifically [[U.S. Route 40|US&nbsp;40]] between [[Manhattan, Kansas]] and [[Limon, Colorado]] and [[U.S. Route 50|US&nbsp;50]] between [[Baldwin City, Kansas]] and [[Garden City, Kansas]]).  In effect, each of the two routes received the same number, with a directional suffix indicating its relation to the other.  These splits were initially shown in the log as\u2014for instance\u2014US&nbsp;40 North and US&nbsp;40 South, but were always posted as simply US&nbsp;40N and US&nbsp;40S.<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>\n\nThe most heated argument, however, was the issue of US&nbsp;60.  The Joint Board had assigned that number to the Chicago-Los Angeles route, which ran more north\u2013south than west\u2013east in Illinois, and then angled sharply to the southwest to [[Oklahoma City]], from where it ran west to [[Los Angeles]]. [[Kentucky]] strongly objected to this designated route, as it had been left off any of the major east-west routes, instead receiving the [[U.S. Route 62 (1925)|US&nbsp;62]] designation. In January 1926, the committee designated this, along with the part of [[U.S. Route 52|US&nbsp;52]] east of [[Ashland, Kentucky]], as [[U.S. Route 60|US&nbsp;60]]. They assigned US&nbsp;62 to the Chicago-Los Angeles route, contingent on the approval of the states along the former US&nbsp;60.  But Missouri and Oklahoma did object\u2014Missouri had already printed maps, and Oklahoma had prepared signs.  A compromise was proposed, in which US&nbsp;60 would split at [[Springfield, Missouri]], into US&nbsp;60E and US&nbsp;60N, but both sides objected.  The final solution resulted in the assignment of [[U.S. Route 66|US&nbsp;66]] to the Chicago-Los Angeles portion of the US highway, which did not end in zero, but was still seen as a satisfyingly round number.<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/> Route 66 came to have a prominent place in popular culture, being featured in song and films.\n\nWith 32&nbsp;states already marking their routes, the plan was approved by AASHO on November 11, 1926.<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>  This plan included a number of directionally split routes, several discontinuous routes (including [[U.S. Route 6|US&nbsp;6]], [[U.S. Route 19|US&nbsp;19]] and [[U.S. Route 50|US&nbsp;50]]), and some termini at state lines.<ref name=\"1926 map\">{{cite map |author1= [[Bureau of Public Roads]] |author2= [[American Association of State Highway Officials]] |date= November 11, 1926 |title= United States System of Highways Adopted for Uniform Marking by the American Association of State Highway Officials |url= https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:United_States_System_of_Highways_Adopted_for_Uniform_Marking_by_the_American_Association_of_State_Highway_Officials.jpg |scale= 1:7,000,000 |location= Washington, DC |publisher= [[United States Geological Survey]] |oclc= 32889555 |accessdate= November 7, 2013 |via= [[Wikimedia Commons]] |last-author-amp= yes}}</ref>  By the time the first route log was published in April 1927, major numbering changes had been made in Pennsylvania in order to align the routes to the existing auto trails.<ref name=\"FHWA PA\">{{cite web |last= Weingroff |first=Richard F. |url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/us22.cfm |title=US&nbsp;22: The William Penn Highway |publisher=Federal Highway Administration |work=Highway History |date=April 7, 2011 |accessdate=June 9, 2011}}</ref> In addition, [[U.S. Route 15]] had been extended across [[Virginia]].<ref name=\"1927 log\">{{cite journal |title=United States Numbered Highways |journal=[[American Highways]] |publisher=American Association of State Highway Officials |date=April 1927 |issn= 0002-8746}}</ref>\n\nMuch of the early criticism of the U.S. Highway System focused on the choice of numbers to designate the highways, rather than names.

While a few roads in the system are still numbered in this manner, AASHO believes that they should be eliminated wherever possible, by the absorption of one of the optional routes into another route.\n\nIn 1934, AASHO tried to eliminate many of the split routes by removing them from the log, and designating one of each pair as a three-digit or alternate route, or in one case [[U.S. Route 37|US&nbsp;37]]. AASHO described its renumbering concept in the October 1934 issue of ''[[American Highways]]'':<ref name=\"FHWA US 11\"/>\n<blockquote>\"Wherever an alternate route is not suitable for its own unique two-digit designation, standard procedure assigns the unqualified number to the older or shorter route, while the other route uses the same number marked by a standard strip above its shield carrying the word 'Alternate'.\"</blockquote>Most states adhere to this approach. However, some maintain legacy routes that violate the rules in various ways.  Examples can be found in [[California]], [[Mississippi]], [[Nebraska]], [[Oregon]], and [[Tennessee]]. In 1952, AASHO permanently recognized the splits in [[U.S. Route 11|US&nbsp;11]],<ref name=\"FHWA US 11\"/> [[U.S. Route 19|US&nbsp;19]], [[U.S. Route 25|US&nbsp;25]], [[U.S. Route 31|US&nbsp;31]], [[U.S. Route 45|US&nbsp;45]], [[U.S. Route 49|US&nbsp;49]], [[U.S. Route 73|US&nbsp;73]], and [[U.S. Route 99|US&nbsp;99]].<ref name=\"FHWA US 11\"/>\n\nFor the most part, the U.S. Routes were the primary means of inter-city vehicle travel; the main exceptions were [[toll road]]s such as the [[Pennsylvania Turnpike]] and [[parkway]] routes such as the [[Merritt Parkway]].

By 1957, AASHO had decided to assign a new grid to the new routes, to be numbered in the opposite directions as the U.S. Highway grid.

Despite the name FN used for this pistol, it was later marketed as the \"FN 1906\", the \"V.P. .25\" (V.P. denoting Vest Pocket), and most confusingly, the \"Baby\".\n\nThe .25 ACP (aka: 6,35&nbsp;mm) cartridge became widely available during this time. The term \"ACP\" stands for \"[[Automatic Colt Pistol]]\".  This cartridge was among the first automatic pistol cartridges to be utilized worldwide.  It was designed with a \"semi-rimmed\" shell casing made of brass.  The rim of the shell casing had a slightly larger circumference than the base of the cartridge and an extractor groove was cut directly above it.  The shell casing head was spaced on this small rim; however, the utilization of the rim in this design complicated the mechanics of the cartridge because, while still in the magazine, the rim of one cartridge would sometimes get hung up on the extractor groove of the following cartridge (also known as \"rim lock\").<ref name=\"HoggWalter2004\"/>\n\nThe 1905 FN Vest Pocket pistol incorporated a frame safety mechanism that constituted the entire rear section of the frame.  It also incorporated a small safety lever on the left side of the frame which locked the trigger. In addition, this frame safety lever mechanism locked the slide about a half inch back from the front of the pistol to enable easy disassembly.\n\n==Design==\nPressured by dozens of imitations and the proliferation of blatant unlicensed copies, FN began work in earnest on a successor product to the 1905 Vest Pocket pistol.  The basic 1905 Vest Pocket pistol design was used as a starting point for the new design. FN's Director of Operations, Mr. Dieudonn\u00e9 Saive, (who would later design the [[Browning Hi-Power]] pistol and [[FN FAL|the FN FAL]] rifle) took it upon himself during 1926-1927 to design the new pistol.<ref name=\"PSA\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.precisionsmallarms.com/history.aspx |title=Precision Small Arms history |access-date=6 April 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090307225334/http://www.precisionsmallarms.com/history.aspx |archive-date=7 March 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nHis design was smaller, lighter, and incorporated several refinements and improvements to the 1905 Vest Pocket version.  For example, the palm-of-hand activated rear-of-frame safety mechanism was eliminated and the small safety lever on the left side of the frame was extended under the grip plate toward the trigger so that the thumb of a right-handed shooter could easily engage and disengage it through flicking the safety lever knob using pressure applied to the side of the safety lever knob. This feature enabled a user to manipulate the safety lever mechanism without having to release one's grip on the pistol.  The frame has a full-length dust guard extending to the end of the slide and an area behind the trigger is relieved to allow a user to maintain a more substantial grip on the pistol then was the case with the 1905 version.  The Dieudonne Saive design also introduced an auto-safety mechanism similar to the one utilized on the Colt Vest Pocket pistol of similar vintage which prevented the pistol from being firing (even if a cartridge was chambered) if the magazine was removed from the frame of the pistol.  A cocking indicator mechanism was also incorporated and is attached to the firing pin spring opposite the firing pin. It protrudes through a pin hole in the rear of the frame when the pistol is loaded.\n\nThe 1931 version was marketed under the name \"BABY\" - and some of the original thermal hardened plastic grip plates were molded with both the initials \"FN\" at the top of the grip plate in a circle and the word \"BABY\" at the bottom of the grip plateunder a raised crescent.  This particular pistol was and continues to be known worldwide as the \"Baby Browning\" pistol and is the pistol reflected in the picture accompanying this article, excepting the BROWNING marked grip plates which indicates a more recent (circa 1960 and beyond) production run utilizing nylon impregnated black polymer grip plates.<ref name=\"HoggWalter2004\">{{cite book|last1=Hogg|first1=Ian|last2=Walter|first2=John|title=Pistols of the World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=okQH6zFgDtUC&pg=PA115|date=29 August 2004|publisher=David & Charles|isbn=0-87349-460-1|pages=29,115|authorlink=Ian V.

Dated 1968]]\n\n===European-based production===\nFN manufactured and marketed the Baby Browning pistol from 1931 until 1979, though exports to the US only took place between 1953-1968. About 550,000 units were produced, including the hand chiseled engraved \"Renaissance\" and the \"Lightweight\" version. The Lightweight utilized a 6061 T6 aluminum frame and hexavalent chrome-plated (over electro-less nickel) slide and external detail parts.  With the exception of special order nickel-plated units and the above-mentioned versions, all of the 1931 Baby Browning pistols were finished in chemical hot blue. The halt to exports to the US in 1968 was mandated by the [[Gun Control Act of 1968]] -  which was precipitated by [[Assassination of Robert F. Kennedy|Robert Kennedy's assassination]] involving an [[Iver Johnson]] manufactured revolver.  This piece of legislation was signed into law by then President Lyndon Johnson, it forbade the importation of certain firearms, among them the 1931 Baby Browning pistol - but it didn't forbid the domestic production of these same weapons.  FN transferred production of the 1931 Baby Browning pistol to [[Manufacture d'armes de Bayonne]] (\"MAB\") during 1979.  Based in Bayonne, France, MAB produced the pistol from 1979 until 1983 when bankruptcy forced it to discontinue production. 1931 Baby Browning pistol production ceased in Europe at that time.<ref name=\"HoggWalter2004\"/>\n\n===North American\u2013based production \u2013 FN-sponsored===\nDuring 1982, discussions began between FN and its North American-based representative Jim Stone focusing on securing a North American-based contractor to manufacture on a turnkey basis the 1931 Baby Browning pistol for FN. In 1984, a Canadian Swiss screw machine shop, [[Precision Small Parts, Ltd]] (PSP), entered into a technology transfer and production agreement with FN to manufacture the 1931 Baby Browning pistol. It was based in Aurora, Ontario, Canada, and maintained a subsidiary in Charlottesville, Virginia.\n\nFN issued an order to PSP for 40,000, with all to be exported to Austria under the Browning logo for onward distribution by FN to its non-USA customers.  PSP's owner (Joseph Maygar Sr.) had a long working relationship with FN dating back to the days of the Hungarian Resistance Movement of WWII. PSP produced firearms parts as well as sub-machine guns for FN.  In 1985, the Canadian federal authorities forced PSP to transfer production of the 1931 Baby Browning pistol frame (the frame = the legal definition of a firearm) to its Virginia, USA facility, though the Canadian side of the company continued to manufacture the slide and detail parts for the pistol (excepting the magazine which was contracted out to Mec-Gar of Italy).  When the USA subsidiary of PSP applied for an export permit with the Department of State to transfer the pistols to FN via its Austrian intermediary, the federal export permit was denied.  At that time, Austria was known to be a trans-shipment point for armaments for the Middle East and the presumption was and remains that State did not want a large number of 1931 Baby Browning pistols ending up in the Middle East.\n\nThe effect of this action on the part of the US Department of State caused PSP to become insolvent (as it had amassed work in process of in excess of 40,000 Baby Browning part sets). The insolvency of the company eventually precipitated a sale to a USA/Canadian-based investor group in 1991 orchestrated by San Francisco, California based merchant banker, Lenn Kristal. During 1995 the technology and inventory of parts of the 1931 FN Baby Browning pistol \"project\" was spun out by the investor group into a new entity under Kristal's control and direction which became known as [https://www.precisionsmallarms.com Precision Small Arms, Inc.] (\"PSA\") and the pistol rebranded at that time as the \"PSA-25 BABY\".\n\nPSA currently offers more than 20 versions of the original 1931 Baby Browning pistol, including exhibition grade versions which incorporate orange, green and yellow gold, hand chisel engraving and rare materials. The PSA 25 pistol is manufactured using computer numeric controlled machining, with all parts hand finished. PSA introduced a 303 stainless steel version of the pistol in 2008; in 2009 it re-introduced an all billet version of the Lightweight renamed the Featherweight which utilizes a 7075 hand drop forged aluminum alloy frame. It makes limited edition runs of damascus and titanium.

Despite the name FN used for this pistol, it was later marketed as the \"FN 1906\", the \"V.P. .25\" (V.P. denoting Vest Pocket), and most confusingly, the \"Baby\".\n\nThe .25 ACP (aka: 6,35&nbsp;mm) cartridge became widely available during this time. The term \"ACP\" stands for \"[[Automatic Colt Pistol]]\".  This cartridge was among the first automatic pistol cartridges to be utilized worldwide.  It was designed with a \"semi-rimmed\" shell casing made of brass.  The rim of the shell casing had a slightly larger circumference than the base of the cartridge and an extractor groove was cut directly above it.  The shell casing head was spaced on this small rim; however, the utilization of the rim in this design complicated the mechanics of the cartridge because, while still in the magazine, the rim of one cartridge would sometimes get hung up on the extractor groove of the following cartridge (also known as \"rim lock\").<ref name=\"HoggWalter2004\"/>\n\nThe 1905 FN Vest Pocket pistol incorporated a frame safety mechanism that constituted the entire rear section of the frame.  It also incorporated a small safety lever on the left side of the frame which locked the trigger. In addition, this frame safety lever mechanism locked the slide about a half inch back from the front of the pistol to enable easy disassembly.\n\n==Design==\nPressured by dozens of imitations and the proliferation of blatant unlicensed copies, FN began work in earnest on a successor product to the 1905 Vest Pocket pistol.  The basic 1905 Vest Pocket pistol design was used as a starting point for the new design. FN's Director of Operations, Mr. Dieudonn\u00e9 Saive, (who would later design the [[Browning Hi-Power]] pistol and [[FN FAL|the FN FAL]] rifle) took it upon himself during 1926-1927 to design the new pistol.<ref name=\"PSA\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.precisionsmallarms.com/history.aspx |title=Precision Small Arms history |access-date=6 April 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090307225334/http://www.precisionsmallarms.com/history.aspx |archive-date=7 March 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nHis design was smaller, lighter, and incorporated several refinements and improvements to the 1905 Vest Pocket version.  For example, the palm-of-hand activated rear-of-frame safety mechanism was eliminated and the small safety lever on the left side of the frame was extended under the grip plate toward the trigger so that the thumb of a right-handed shooter could easily engage and disengage it through flicking the safety lever knob using pressure applied to the side of the safety lever knob. This feature enabled a user to manipulate the safety lever mechanism without having to release one's grip on the pistol.  The frame has a full-length dust guard extending to the end of the slide and an area behind the trigger is relieved to allow a user to maintain a more substantial grip on the pistol then was the case with the 1905 version.  The Dieudonne Saive design also introduced an auto-safety mechanism similar to the one utilized on the Colt Vest Pocket pistol of similar vintage which prevented the pistol from being firing (even if a cartridge was chambered) if the magazine was removed from the frame of the pistol.  A cocking indicator mechanism was also incorporated and is attached to the firing pin spring opposite the firing pin. It protrudes through a pin hole in the rear of the frame when the pistol is loaded.\n\nThe 1931 version was marketed under the name \"BABY\" - and some of the original thermal hardened plastic grip plates were molded with both the initials \"FN\" at the top of the grip plate in a circle and the word \"BABY\" at the bottom of the grip plateunder a raised crescent.  This particular pistol was and continues to be known worldwide as the \"Baby Browning\" pistol and is the pistol reflected in the picture accompanying this article, excepting the BROWNING marked grip plates which indicates a more recent (circa 1960 and beyond) production run utilizing nylon impregnated black polymer grip plates.<ref name=\"HoggWalter2004\">{{cite book|last1=Hogg|first1=Ian|last2=Walter|first2=John|title=Pistols of the World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=okQH6zFgDtUC&pg=PA115|date=29 August 2004|publisher=David & Charles|isbn=0-87349-460-1|pages=29,115|authorlink=Ian V.

Dated 1968]]\n\n===European-based production===\nFN manufactured and marketed the Baby Browning pistol from 1931 until 1979, though exports to the US only took place between 1953-1968. About 550,000 units were produced, including the hand chiseled engraved \"Renaissance\" and the \"Lightweight\" version. The Lightweight utilized a 6061 T6 aluminum frame and hexavalent chrome-plated (over electro-less nickel) slide and external detail parts.  With the exception of special order nickel-plated units and the above-mentioned versions, all of the 1931 Baby Browning pistols were finished in chemical hot blue. The halt to exports to the US in 1968 was mandated by the [[Gun Control Act of 1968]] -  which was precipitated by [[Assassination of Robert F. Kennedy|Robert Kennedy's assassination]] involving an [[Iver Johnson]] manufactured revolver.  This piece of legislation was signed into law by then President Lyndon Johnson, it forbade the importation of certain firearms, among them the 1931 Baby Browning pistol - but it didn't forbid the domestic production of these same weapons.  FN transferred production of the 1931 Baby Browning pistol to [[Manufacture d'armes de Bayonne]] (\"MAB\") during 1979.  Based in Bayonne, France, MAB produced the pistol from 1979 until 1983 when bankruptcy forced it to discontinue production. 1931 Baby Browning pistol production ceased in Europe at that time.<ref name=\"HoggWalter2004\"/>\n\n===North American\u2013based production \u2013 FN-sponsored===\nDuring 1982, discussions began between FN and its North American-based representative Jim Stone focusing on securing a North American-based contractor to manufacture on a turnkey basis the 1931 Baby Browning pistol for FN. In 1984, a Canadian Swiss screw machine shop, [[Precision Small Parts, Ltd]] (PSP), entered into a technology transfer and production agreement with FN to manufacture the 1931 Baby Browning pistol. It was based in Aurora, Ontario, Canada, and maintained a subsidiary in Charlottesville, Virginia.\n\nFN issued an order to PSP for 40,000, with all to be exported to Austria under the Browning logo for onward distribution by FN to its non-USA customers.  PSP's owner (Joseph Maygar Sr.) had a long working relationship with FN dating back to the days of the Hungarian Resistance Movement of WWII. PSP produced firearms parts as well as sub-machine guns for FN.  In 1985, the Canadian federal authorities forced PSP to transfer production of the 1931 Baby Browning pistol frame (the frame = the legal definition of a firearm) to its Virginia, USA facility, though the Canadian side of the company continued to manufacture the slide and detail parts for the pistol (excepting the magazine which was contracted out to Mec-Gar of Italy).  When the USA subsidiary of PSP applied for an export permit with the Department of State to transfer the pistols to FN via its Austrian intermediary, the federal export permit was denied.  At that time, Austria was known to be a trans-shipment point for armaments for the Middle East and the presumption was and remains that State did not want a large number of 1931 Baby Browning pistols ending up in the Middle East.\n\nThe effect of this action on the part of the US Department of State caused PSP to become insolvent (as it had amassed work in process of in excess of 40,000 Baby Browning part sets). The insolvency of the company eventually precipitated a sale to a USA/Canadian-based investor group in 1991 orchestrated by San Francisco, California based merchant banker, Lenn Kristal. During 1995 the technology and inventory of parts of the 1931 FN Baby Browning pistol \"project\" was spun out by the investor group into a new entity under Kristal's control and direction which became known as [[Precision Small Arms]], Inc.(\"PSA\") and the pistol rebranded at that time as the \"PSA-25 BABY\".\n\nPSA currently offers more than 20 versions of the original 1931 Baby Browning pistol, including exhibition grade versions which incorporate orange, green and yellow gold, hand chisel engraving and rare materials. The PSA 25 pistol is manufactured using computer numeric controlled machining, with all parts hand finished. PSA introduced a 303 stainless steel version of the pistol in 2008; in 2009 it re-introduced an all billet version of the Lightweight renamed the Featherweight which utilizes a 7075 hand drop forged aluminum alloy frame. It makes limited edition runs of damascus and titanium.  As of the beginning of 2017, all of PSA's 24 versions of the 1931 Baby Browning pistol were being manufactured in Minden, Nevada, USA.<ref name=\"RamageSigler2008\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0pSA2xVGZVYC&pg=PA29|title=Guns Illustrated 2009|last1=Ramage|first1=Ken|last2=Sigler|first2=Derrek|date=19 November 2008|publisher=F+W Media, Inc|isbn=0-89689-673-0|location=Iola, Wisconsin|page=29}}</ref> The USA Patent Office issued a Configuration Patent to Precision Small Arms, Inc. for the configuration (image) of the 1931 Baby Browning pistol in 2015.\n\nThis is the presently the only manufacturer of this pistol.\n\n===North American\u2013based production \u2013 non-FN-sponsored===\n[[File:Bauer .25 Auto pistol.jpg|thumb|Bauer .25 Auto pocket pistol.]]\nFrom 1972 until 1984, a company named [[Bauer Automatic|Bauer Firearms]] of [[Fraser, Michigan]]<nowiki/> manufactured and marketed an [[Bauer Automatic|unlicensed copy]] of the 1931 Baby Browning pistol which was machined from 416 stainless steel.<ref name=\"Lee2012\">{{cite book|last=Lee|first=Jerry|title=Standard Catalog of Handguns|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1DzXheNr0NcC&pg=PA53|date=17 January 2012|publisher=Gun Digest Books|location=Iola, Wisconsin|isbn=1-4402-3009-9|page=53}}</ref> The pistol was marketed as the \"Fraser-25\" from 1984 to 1986.<ref name=\"Wood2007\">{{cite book|last=Wood|first=J B|title=Automatic Pistols Assembly/Disassembly|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ckahWjsGxrUC&pg=PA49|date=21 October 2007|publisher=Gun Digest Books|location=Iola, Wisconsin|isbn=1-4402-2630-X|pages=49\u201356}}</ref>\n\nThis pistol was an approximate copy of the 1931 Baby Browning pistol and was designed as such in order to avoid copyright infringement claims from FN, which at that time still had USA patent protection on various components of the 1931 Baby Browning pistol.
