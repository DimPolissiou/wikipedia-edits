It is regarded one of his finest works and was presented by Sir George Beaumont in 1823 and 1828.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/canaletto-the-stonemasons-yard|title=Canaletto {{!}} The Stonemason's Yard {{!}} NG127 {{!}} National Gallery, London|website=www.nationalgallery.org.uk|access-date=2016-04-22}}</ref>\n\nLater Canaletto painted grand scenes of the canals of Venice and the [[Doge's Palace, Venice|Doge's Palace]]. His large-scale landscapes portrayed the city's pageantry and waning traditions, making innovative use of atmospheric effects and strong [[local color (visual art)|local colours]]. For these qualities, his works may be said to have anticipated [[Impressionism]].\n\nHis graphic print ''S. A. Giustina in Pr\u00e0 della Vale'' was found in the [[Gurlitt Collection|2012 Munich Art Hoard]].<ref name=spiegel>{{cite news|url=http://www.spiegel.de/fotostrecke/photo-gallery-munich-nazi-art-stash-revealed-fotostrecke-103675-8.html |title=Photo Gallery: Munich Nazi Art Stash Revealed |date=17 November 2013|work=Spiegel|accessdate=17 November 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Work in England==\n[[File:Canaletto - Architectural Capriccio - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''Architectural Capriccio'', drawing, [[Morgan Library & Museum]]]]\n[[File:Giovanni Antonio Canal, il Canaletto - The portico with a lantern - from the series 'Vedute' (Views) - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|''The portico with a lantern'', from the series ''Vedute'', c.&nbsp;1740\u20131744, etching]]\n[[File:Canaletto - Westminster Bridge, with the Lord Mayor's Procession on the Thames - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|The first [[Westminster Bridge]], 1746]]\n[[File:Westminster Abbey by Canaletto.jpg|thumb|''[[Westminster Abbey]] with a procession of [[Knights of the Bath]]'', 1749]]\n\nMany of his pictures were sold to Englishmen on their [[Grand Tour]], first through the agency of [[Owen Swiny]] and later the banker [[Joseph Smith (1682\u20131770)|Joseph Smith]]. It was Swiny in the late 1720s who encouraged the artist to paint small topographical views of Venice with a commercial appeal for tourists and foreign visitors to the city.  Sometime before 1728, Canaletto began his association with Smith, an English businessman and collector living in Venice who was appointed British Consul in Venice in 1744. Smith later became the artist's principal agent and patron, acquiring nearly fifty paintings, one hundred fifty drawings, and fifteen rare etchings from Canaletto, the largest and finest single group of the artist's works, which he sold to King George III in 1763.<ref>{{cite web |title=Canaletto |website=National Gallery of Art |url=https://www.nga.gov/collection/artist-info.1080.html |accessdate=2 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1740s Canaletto's market was disrupted when the [[War of the Austrian Succession]] led to a reduction in the number of British visitors to Venice.<ref>{{cite book| author = Antonio Canaletto|author2=Antonio Visentini| title = Views of Venice: By Canaletto| year = 1971| publisher = Courier Dover Publications| isbn = 978-0-486-22705-4 }}</ref> Smith also arranged for the publication of a series of etchings of \"capricci\" (or architectural phantasies) (''[[Capriccio (painting)|capriccio]]'' Italian for fancy) in his ''[[vedute]] ideale'',<ref name=Tecco /> but the returns were not high enough, and in 1746 Canaletto moved to London, to be closer to his market.<ref name=Macfall />\n\nHe remained in England until 1755, producing views of London (including several of the new [[Westminster Bridge]], which was completed during his stay) and of his patrons' houses and castles. These included [[Northumberland House]] for  Sir Hugh Smithson, Bt., who by marriage later became the [[Hugh Percy, 1st Duke of Northumberland|2nd Earl of Northumberland]]; and [[Warwick Castle]] for Lord Brooke, later [[Francis Greville, 1st Earl of Warwick|1st Earl of Warwick]]. Smithson was one of the commissioners of Westminster Bridge, and it is \"not impossible\" that he had encouraged Canaletto to come to England and record the beginning of the bridge's life.<ref name=Links >{{cite journal |last=Links |first=J.

Canaletto's painting began to suffer from repetitiveness, losing its fluidity, and becoming mechanical to the point that the English art critic [[George Vertue]] suggested that the man painting under the name 'Canaletto' was an impostor. This may have been because Canaletto's nephew, [[Bernardo Bellotto]], was also using his uncle's nickname; or more likely because the story had been spread by unscrupulous art dealers who had been passing off copies of Canaletto's own work and were anxious to see him return to Venice.<ref name=Links /> Historian Michael Levey described his work from this period as \"inhibited\".<ref name=\"Levey1994\">{{cite book|author=Michael Levey|title=Painting in Eighteenth-century Venice|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WiOT_si7F0AC&pg=PA114|year=1994|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-06057-7|pages=114\u20135}}</ref>\n\nIn order to refute this claim the artist, through an advertisement in a newspaper, invited \"any Gentleman\" to inspect his latest painting of [[St. James's Park]] at his studio in Silver Street (now [[Beak Street]]) off [[Golden Square]];<ref name=Links /> however, his reputation never fully recovered in his lifetime.<ref>{{cite book| author = John Eglin| title = Venice Transfigured: The Myth of Venice in British Culture, 1660\u20131797| date = 13 January 2001| publisher = Palgrave Macmillan| isbn = 978-0-312-23299-3 }}</ref>\n\nAfter his return to Venice, Canaletto was elected to the [[Venetian Academy]] in 1763 and appointed prior of the ''Collegio dei Pittori''. He continued to paint until his death in 1768. In his later years he often worked from old sketches, but he sometimes produced surprising new compositions. He was willing to make subtle alterations to topography for artistic effect.<ref name=Tecco />\n\n==Market==\nHis students included his nephew [[Bernardo Bellotto]], [[Francesco Guardi]], [[Michele Marieschi]], [[Gabriele Bella]], and [[Giuseppe Moretti]]. The painter, [[Giuseppe Bernardino Bison]] was a follower of his style.<ref name=Fletcher />\n\nJoseph Smith sold much of his collection to [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]], creating the bulk of the large collection of works by Canaletto owned by the [[Royal Collection]]. in 1762, George III paid \u00a320,000 for Consul Smith's collection of 50 paintings and 142 drawings.<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/canaletto-his-finest-work-and-a-royal-exhibition-326333.html Louise Jury, the Independent, 11 November, 2005]</ref> There are many examples of his work in other British collections, including several (19) at the [[Wallace Collection]] and a set of 24 in the dining room at [[Woburn Abbey]]. A large set of Canaletto works was also part of the collection of the [[Earl of Carlisle|Earls of Carlisle]], however many were lost at the 1940 fire of [[Castle Howard]] and others were sold over the last century. Among those formerly at the Carlisle collection are ''The Bacino di San Marco: looking East'', now at the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston|Museum of Fine Arts]], Boston (sold in 1939) and the pair ''Entrance to the Grand Canal from the Molo, Venice'' and ''The Square of Saint Mark's, Venice'', now at the [[National Gallery of Art]], Washington DC (sold in 1938). The last important venetian ''veduta'' at Castle Howard was by [[Bernardo Bellotto]], ''A View of the Grand Canal Looking South from the Palazzo Foscari'', which was sold at Sotheby's in July 2015 for [[British Pound|\u00a3]]2.6 million.\n\nCanaletto's views always fetched high prices, and as early as the 18th century [[Catherine the Great]] and other European monarchs vied for his grandest paintings. The record price paid at auction for a Canaletto is [[British Pound|\u00a3]]18.6 million for ''View of the Grand Canal from [[Palazzo Balbi]] to the Rialto'', set at [[Sotheby's]] in London in July 2005.\n\n==Works==\n{{Expand list|date=February 2011}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!

It was Swiny in the late 1720s who encouraged the artist to paint small topographical views of Venice with a commercial appeal for tourists and foreign visitors to the city.  Sometime before 1728, Canaletto began his association with Smith, an English businessman and collector living in Venice who was appointed British Consul in Venice in 1744. Smith later became the artist's principal agent and patron, acquiring nearly fifty paintings, one hundred fifty drawings, and fifteen rare etchings from Canaletto, the largest and finest single group of the artist's works, which he sold to King George III in 1763.<ref>{{cite web |title=Canaletto |website=National Gallery of Art |url=https://www.nga.gov/collection/artist-info.1080.html |accessdate=2 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1740s Canaletto's market was disrupted when the [[War of the Austrian Succession]] led to a reduction in the number of British visitors to Venice.<ref>{{cite book| author = Antonio Canaletto|author2=Antonio Visentini| title = Views of Venice: By Canaletto| year = 1971| publisher = Courier Dover Publications| isbn = 978-0-486-22705-4 }}</ref> Smith also arranged for the publication of a series of etchings of \"capricci\" (or architectural phantasies) (''[[Capriccio (painting)|capriccio]]'' Italian for fancy) in his ''[[vedute]] ideale'',<ref name=Tecco /> but the returns were not high enough, and in 1746 Canaletto moved to London, to be closer to his market.<ref name=Macfall />\n\nHe remained in England until 1755, producing views of London (including several of the new [[Westminster Bridge]], which was completed during his stay) and of his patrons' houses and castles.

Among those formerly at the Carlisle collection are ''The Bacino di San Marco: looking East'', now at the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston|Museum of Fine Arts]], Boston (sold in 1939) and the pair ''Entrance to the Grand Canal from the Molo, Venice'' and ''The Square of Saint Mark's, Venice'', now at the [[National Gallery of Art]], Washington DC (sold in 1938). The last important venetian ''veduta'' at Castle Howard was by [[Bernardo Bellotto]], ''A View of the Grand Canal Looking South from the Palazzo Foscari'', which was sold at Sotheby's in July 2015 for [[British Pound|\u00a3]]2.6 million.\n\nCanaletto's views always fetched high prices, and as early as the 18th century [[Catherine the Great]] and other European monarchs vied for his grandest paintings. The record price paid at auction for a Canaletto is [[British Pound|\u00a3]]18.6 million for ''View of the Grand Canal from [[Palazzo Balbi]] to the Rialto'', set at [[Sotheby's]] in London in July 2005.\n\n==Works==\n{{Expand list|date=February 2011}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!

It was released as the third and final single from Eminem's ''[[The Slim Shady LP]]'' (1999).  It was also released on his 2005 greatest hits album ''[[Curtain Call: The Hits]]''. It samples \"[[I Will Follow Him]]\" by [[Little Peggy March]].\n\n==Background==\nWhile Eminem and Dr. Dre were at a gym, they were talking about song concepts, and Dre said that they should do a song together called \"Night 'n' Day\", where everything Dre was saying, Eminem would say the complete opposite. Eminem thought about it and went home that same night and began writing it. An announcer from a talent agency was hired to come in to voice the narrator. Eminem and co. told him his parts and what he had to say, and they made the skit around what he said.<ref>''[[Angry Blonde]]'' pg. 52 and 53</ref>\n\n==Lyrics==\n\"Guilty Conscience\" features a duel between the two rappers playing the roles of good and evil in someone's head in the manner of a medieval [[morality play]], i.e., the angel and devil on a person's shoulders competing for possession of the person's soul. [[Dr. Dre]] is the angel; [[Eminem|Slim Shady]] the devil. The song contains spoken parts and sound effects describing several conflicting scenarios building tension and curiosity, narrated by [[Mark Avery]]. Eminem is generally credited for writing Dre's verses as well as his own.\n\nThe first verse of the song features the story of Eddie, 23, a frustrated young man about to rob a liquor store. Dre warns Eddie not to go through with it, telling him that the witnesses will report the robbery to the police, that it will be mentioned on the news, and that Eddie will end up on the most wanted list. Slim Shady urges Eddie to go through with his plan; he tells Eddie to go to his aunts' house and disguise himself so witnesses would not recognize him. Shady uses the [[poverty]] of Eddie's family to justify the robbery, and in the unedited version, tries to persuade Eddie to [[murder]] the [[clerk (position)|store clerk]], whom Dre says is \"older than [[George Burns]]\". Though in the song alone the end is ambiguous, the [[music video]] depicts Eddie ultimately deciding not to go through with the theft and walks away.\n\nIn the next verse, the 21-year-old Stan takes an underage girl upstairs during a [[rave]] party. In the Director's Cut music video, the scene takes place at a [[Fraternities and sororities|fraternity]] party. [[Eminem]] attempts to convince Stan to [[Date rape|date-rape]] the girl over Dre's protests and warnings about jail time for [[statutory rape]], and it is left somewhat vague whether or not Stan goes through with it. Dre refers to the 1995 movie ''[[Kids (film)|Kids]]'' in which the climax scene shows a teenage boy date-raping a girl who is infected with HIV. In the uncensored version of the song, Slim Shady suggests unprotected sex in an earlier refrain. Shady also references [[Funkdoobiest]] front man Son Doobie. In the edited version, the intensity is toned down and Slim suggests leaving the girl passed out on her parents' doorstep. The scene, especially the edited ending version, is reminiscent of a famous scene from the movie ''[[Animal House]]''. During the narration of this scene, the song \"Hoochie Mama\" by [[2 Live Crew]] is heard playing in the background at the party.\n\nIn the third verse, Grady, a 29-year-old construction worker, comes home to find his wife having sex with another man in bed. In the unedited version, Slim Shady demands that Grady brutally kill his wife. When Dre tries to cut in, Slim tells Grady to leave his wife and take their kids with him, bringing up Dre's violent [[N.W.A]] past accusing him of [[hypocrisy]], including when he says \"You gonna take advice from somebody who slapped [[Dee Barnes]]?\" and again when he says, \"Mr. Dre, Mr. [[N.W.A]], Mr. [[AK-47|A.K.]] coming ''[[Straight Outta Compton]]'', y'all better make way. How in the fuck are you gonna tell this man not to be violent?\" In turn, Dre argues that Grady does not need to take the same foolish path Dre himself once took, saying \"[[Been There, Done That (Dr. Dre song)|Been There, Done That]]\". In the end, Shady's taunting pushes Dre into agreeing that Grady should murder both his wife and her lover. This particular ending caused a lot of [[controversy]], especially since it was left in the edited version of the song. This song was referenced multiple times in Eminem's next album, ''[[The Marshall Mathers LP]]''.\n\n==Critical reception==\nAllmusic highlighted this song on LP.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-slim-shady-lp-mw0000601851|title=The Slim Shady LP - Eminem - Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards - AllMusic|author=Stephen Thomas Erlewine|work=AllMusic|accessdate=25 April 2015}}</ref> David Browne noted that Eminem's \"coldly-calculated-to-offend alter ego considers date rape\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,274722,00.html|title=The Slim Shady LP - EW.com|work=Entertainment Weekly's EW.com|accessdate=25 April 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Music video==\nThe video for \"Guilty Conscience\" has a nonstop back-beat with a chorus, unlike the album version, and a different narrator, played by actor [[Robert Culp]]. The lyrics in the chorus samples the song \"[[I Will Follow Him]]\" by [[Little Peggy March]] (''\"These voices, I hear them. And, when they talk, I'll follow\"''). The version that aired on [[MTV]] eliminated the murder at the end of the song and converted it into an escalating argument between Eminem and Dre with no resolution. The Director's Cut leaves the murder in.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbw_BxDwdjk Video clip] on YouTube</ref> The video is produced using the [[bullet time]] technique, depicting Eminem and Dr. Dre rapping to the song's protagonists on how to deal with their conflicting situations: including a man's temptation to robbing a liquor store, a college student's urge to have sex with an underage girl at a frat party, and the urge of a construction worker to murder his wife after he catches her cheating with another man. [[Dr. Dre]] poses as the \"good conscience\" and wins the first arguments (Eddie) while Eminem poses as the \"evil conscience\" and wins the second (Stan). However, in the third argument, which is over the actions Grady (the construction worker) should take when he catches his wife cheating with another man, [[Eminem]]'s taunting and accusations of hypocrisy coaxes [[Dr. Dre]] into agreeing with him that Grady should kill them both and subsequently Dre suggests that Grady should get his gun and murder his wife and her lover. The song contains a sample from the [[Ronald Stein]] song \"Go Home Pigs\" from the soundtrack to the film ''[[Getting Straight]]''. Eminem later released \"Guilty Conscience\" on his greatest hits album, ''[[Curtain Call: The Hits]]''. The nonstop back-beat and chorus from the music video were only used in the edited version of the song, but the narrator was not changed. The video won the \"Hottest Music Video\" award at the Online Hip-Hop Awards in 2000.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.nyrock.com/worldbeat/04_2000/041400.asp# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-07-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629000315/http://www.nyrock.com/worldbeat/04_2000/041400.asp# |archive-date=2011-06-29 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://onlinehiphopawards.com/list_winners.cfm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000617074920/http://onlinehiphopawards.com/list_winners.cfm|title=The Online Hip-Hop Awards|archivedate=17 June 2000|publisher=|accessdate=25 April 2015}}</ref> The video was listed on [[MuchMusic|MuchMusic's]] ''50 Most Controversial Videos'' at No. 38 for its promotion on how people get crossed with their consciences.\n\n==Lawsuit==\nIn September 2003, 70-year-old widow Harlene Stein filed suit against Eminem and Dr. Dre on the grounds that \"Guilty Conscience\" contains an unauthorized sample of \"Pigs Go Home\" composed for the film ''[[Getting Straight]]'' by her husband, [[Ronald Stein]], who died in 1988.<ref name=\"OldLady\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1478649/eminem-sued-over-sample.jhtml|title=Eminem Gets Sued&nbsp;...

It was released as the third and final single from Eminem's ''[[The Slim Shady LP]]'' (1999).  It was also released on his 2005 greatest hits album ''[[Curtain Call: The Hits]]''. It samples \"[[I Will Follow Him]]\" by [[Little Peggy March]].\n\n==Background==\nWhile Eminem and Dr. Dre were at a gym, they were talking about song concepts, and Dre said that they should do a song together called \"Night 'n' Day\", where everything Dre was saying, Eminem would say the complete opposite. Eminem thought about it and went home that same night and began writing it. An announcer from a talent agency was hired to come in to voice the narrator. Eminem and co. told him his parts and what he had to say, and they made the skit around what he said.<ref>''[[Angry Blonde]]'' pg. 52 and 53</ref>\n\n==Lyrics==\n\"Guilty Conscience\" features a duel between the two rappers playing the roles of good and evil in someone's head in the manner of a medieval [[morality play]], i.e., the angel and devil on a person's shoulders competing for possession of the person's soul. [[Dr. Dre]] is the angel; [[Eminem|Slim Shady]] the devil. The song contains spoken parts and sound effects describing several conflicting scenarios building tension and curiosity, narrated by [[Mark Avery]]. Eminem is generally credited for writing Dre's verses as well as his own.\n\nThe first verse of the song features the story of Eddie, 23, a frustrated young man about to rob a liquor store. Dre warns Eddie not to go through with it, telling him that the witnesses will report the robbery to the police, that it will be mentioned on the news, and that Eddie will end up on the most wanted list. Slim Shady urges Eddie to go through with his plan; he tells Eddie to go to his aunts' house and disguise himself so witnesses would not recognize him. Shady uses the [[poverty]] of Eddie's family to justify the robbery, and in the unedited version, tries to persuade Eddie to [[murder]] the [[clerk (position)|store clerk]], whom Dre says is \"older than [[George Burns]]\". Though in the song alone the end is ambiguous, the [[music video]] depicts Eddie ultimately deciding not to go through with the theft and walks away.\n\nIn the next verse, the 21-year-old Stan takes an underage girl upstairs during a [[rave]] party. In the Director's Cut music video, the scene takes place at a [[Fraternities and sororities|fraternity]] party. [[Eminem]] attempts to convince Stan to [[Date rape|date-rape]] the girl over Dre's protests and warnings about jail time for [[statutory rape]], and it is left somewhat vague whether or not Stan goes through with it. Dre refers to the 1995 movie ''[[Kids (film)|Kids]]'' in which the climax scene shows a teenage boy date-raping a girl who is infected with HIV. In the uncensored version of the song, Slim Shady suggests unprotected sex in an earlier refrain. Shady also references [[Funkdoobiest]] front man Son Doobie. In the edited version, the intensity is toned down and Slim suggests leaving the girl passed out on her parents' doorstep. The scene, especially the edited ending version, is reminiscent of a famous scene from the movie ''[[Animal House]]''. During the narration of this scene, the song \"Hoochie Mama\" by [[2 Live Crew]] is heard playing in the background at the party.\n\nIn the third verse, Grady, a 29-year-old construction worker, comes home to find his wife having sex with another man in bed. In the unedited version, Slim Shady demands that Grady brutally kill his wife. When Dre tries to cut in, Slim tells Grady to leave his wife and take their kids with him, bringing up Dre's violent [[N.W.A]] past accusing him of [[hypocrisy]], including when he says \"You gonna take advice from somebody who slapped [[Dee Barnes]]?\" and again when he says, \"Mr. Dre, Mr. [[N.W.A]], Mr. [[AK-47|A.K.]] coming ''[[Straight Outta Compton]]'', y'all better make way. How in the fuck are you gonna tell this man not to be violent?\" In turn, Dre argues that Grady does not need to take the same foolish path Dre himself once took, saying \"[[Been There, Done That (Dr. Dre song)|Been There, Done That]]\". In the end, Shady's taunting pushes Dre into agreeing that Grady should murder both his wife and her lover. This particular ending caused a lot of [[controversy]], especially since it was left in the edited version of the song. This song was referenced multiple times in Eminem's next album, ''[[The Marshall Mathers LP]]''.\n\n==Critical reception==\nAllmusic highlighted this song on LP.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-slim-shady-lp-mw0000601851|title=The Slim Shady LP - Eminem - Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards - AllMusic|author=Stephen Thomas Erlewine|work=AllMusic|accessdate=25 April 2015}}</ref> David Browne noted that Eminem's \"coldly-calculated-to-offend alter ego considers date rape\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,274722,00.html|title=The Slim Shady LP - EW.com|work=Entertainment Weekly's EW.com|accessdate=25 April 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Music video==\nThe video for \"Guilty Conscience\" has a nonstop back-beat with a chorus, unlike the album version, and a different narrator, played by actor [[Robert Culp]]. The lyrics in the chorus samples the song \"[[I Will Follow Him]]\" by [[Little Peggy March]] (''\"These voices, I hear them. And, when they talk, I'll follow\"''). The version that aired on [[MTV]] eliminated the murder at the end of the song and converted it into an escalating argument between Eminem and Dre with no resolution. The Director's Cut leaves the murder in.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbw_BxDwdjk Video clip] on YouTube</ref> The video is produced using the [[bullet time]] technique, depicting Eminem and Dr. Dre rapping to the song's protagonists on how to deal with their conflicting situations: including a man's temptation to robbing a liquor store, a college student's urge to have sex with an underage girl at a frat party, and the urge of a construction worker to murder his wife after he catches her cheating with another man. [[Dr. Dre]] poses as the \"good conscience\" and wins the first arguments (Eddie) while Eminem poses as the \"evil conscience\" and wins the second (Stan). However, in the third argument, which is over the actions Grady (the construction worker) should take when he catches his wife cheating with another man, [[Eminem]]'s taunting and accusations of hypocrisy coaxes [[Dr. Dre]] into agreeing with him that Grady should kill them both and subsequently Dre suggests that Grady should get his gun and murder his wife and her lover. The song contains a sample from the [[Ronald Stein]] song \"Go Home Pigs\" from the soundtrack to the film ''[[Getting Straight]]''. Eminem later released \"Guilty Conscience\" on his greatest hits album, ''[[Curtain Call: The Hits]]''. The nonstop back-beat and chorus from the music video were only used in the edited version of the song, but the narrator was not changed. The video won the \"Hottest Music Video\" award at the Online Hip-Hop Awards in 2000.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.nyrock.com/worldbeat/04_2000/041400.asp# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-07-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629000315/http://www.nyrock.com/worldbeat/04_2000/041400.asp# |archive-date=2011-06-29 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://onlinehiphopawards.com/list_winners.cfm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000617074920/http://onlinehiphopawards.com/list_winners.cfm|title=The Online Hip-Hop Awards|archivedate=17 June 2000|publisher=|accessdate=25 April 2015}}</ref> The video was listed on [[MuchMusic|MuchMusic's]] ''50 Most Controversial Videos'' at No. 38 for its promotion on how people get crossed with their consciences.\n\n==Lawsuit==\nIn September 2003, 70-year-old widow Harlene Stein filed suit against Eminem and Dr. Dre on the grounds that \"Guilty Conscience\" contains an unauthorized sample of \"Pigs Go Home\" composed for the film ''[[Getting Straight]]'' by her husband, [[Ronald Stein]], who died in 1988.<ref name=\"OldLady\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1478649/eminem-sued-over-sample.jhtml|title=Eminem Gets Sued&nbsp;...

F. Benson was born at [[Wellington College (Berkshire)|Wellington College]] in Berkshire, the fifth child of the headmaster, [[Edward White Benson]] (later [[chancellor]] of [[Lincoln Cathedral]], [[Bishop of Truro]] and [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]), and his wife born [[Mary Benson (hostess)|Mary Sidgwick]] (\"Minnie\").\n\nE. F. Benson was the younger brother of [[A. C. Benson|Arthur Christopher Benson]], who wrote the words to \"[[Land of Hope and Glory]]\", [[Robert Hugh Benson]], author of several novels and Roman Catholic [[apologetic]] works, and [[Margaret Benson]] (Maggie), an author and amateur [[Egyptologist]]. Two other siblings died young. Benson's parents had six children and no grandchildren.\n\nBenson was educated at [[Temple Grove School]], then at [[Marlborough College]], where he wrote some of his earliest works and upon which he based his novel ''[[David Blaize]]''.  He continued his education at [[King's College, Cambridge]].<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{acad|id=BN887EF |name=Benson, Edward Frederic}}</ref> At Cambridge, he was a member of the [[Pitt Club]],<ref>{{cite book |last1=Benson |first1=Edward Frederic |authorlink1=E.F.

Benson wrote in his diary: \"I feel perfectly mad about him just now...Ah, if only he knew, and yet I think he does.\"<ref name=\"Masters 1992, p86\">Masters, Brian \"The Life Of E.F. Benson\", Chatto & Windus, 1992, p86</ref>\n\n==Works==\n[[File:Title Page of Miss Mapp.png|thumb|right|190px|Title page of ''Miss Mapp'', 1922.]]\n\nBenson's first book published was ''Sketches From Marlborough''.  He started his novel writing career with the (then) fashionably controversial ''Dodo'' (1893), which was an instant success, and followed it with a variety of satire \nand romantic and supernatural melodrama. He repeated the success of ''Dodo'', which featured a scathing description of composer and militant suffragette [[Ethel Smyth]] (which she \"gleefully acknowledged\", according to actress [[Prunella Scales]]{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}), with the same cast of characters a generation later: ''Dodo the Second'' (1914), \"a unique chronicle of the pre-1914 [[Bright Young People|Bright Young Things]]\" and ''Dodo Wonders'' (1921), \"a first-hand [[social history]] of the [[World War I|Great War]] in [[Mayfair]] and the [[Shire]]s\".<ref>Introduction by Prunella Scales to ''Dodo: An Omnibus''. Introduction in 1986 edition from The Hogarth Press. Original publication of novels 1893, 1914, 1921.</ref> The [[Mapp and Lucia]] series, written relatively late in his career, consists of six novels and two short stories. The novels are: ''Queen Lucia'', ''Lucia in London'', ''Miss Mapp'', ''Mapp and Lucia'', ''Lucia's Progress'' (published as ''The Worshipful Lucia'' in the United States) and ''Trouble for Lucia''.  The short stories are \"The Male Impersonator\" and \"Desirable Residences\". Both appear in anthologies of Benson's short stories, and the former is also often appended to the end of the novel ''Miss Mapp''.\n\nIn February 1983 [[BBC Radio 4]] broadcast ''Trouble for Lucia'' \u2013 a 12-part adaptation by [[Aubrey Woods]] of the first four novels. In April and May 2007 [[BBC Radio 4]] broadcast ''Mapp and Lucia'' \u2013 a ten-part adaptation by [[Ned Sherrin]]. In 2008 [[BBC Radio 4]] broadcast ''Lucia's Progress'' \u2013 a five-part dramatisation by John Peacock of the fifth novel.\n\nThe last three novels were dramatised by [[Gerald Savory]] for a ten-episode TV series produced by [[London Weekend Television]] and broadcast in two five-part runs between 1985 and 1986 on the then recently launched [[Channel 4]]. Titled ''Mapp and Lucia'', the series featured [[Geraldine McEwan]] as Lucia, [[Prunella Scales]] as Mapp and [[Nigel Hawthorne]] as Georgie. In 2007 the British channel [[ITV3]] broadcast the 1985\u201386 series. A three-part dramatisation by [[Steve Pemberton]] \u2013 starring [[Miranda Richardson]] as Mapp, [[Anna Chancellor]] as Lucia and [[Steve Pemberton]] as Georgie \u2013 was broadcast on [[BBC One]] over consecutive evenings between 29 and 31 December 2014.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/proginfo/2014/52/mapp-and-lucia |title=New adaptation of E.&nbsp;F. Benson's 'Mapp and Lucia' on BBC1 | date=21 Dec 2014}}</ref>\n\nBenson was also known as a writer of atmospheric and at times humorous or satirical [[Ghost story|ghost stories]], which were often first published in story magazines such as ''[[Pearson's Magazine]]'' or ''Hutchinson's Magazine'', 20 of which were illustrated by [[Edmund Blampied]].  These \"spook stories\", as they were also termed, were then reprinted in collections by his principal publisher, [[Hutchinson (publisher)|Walter Hutchinson]]. His 1906 short story, \"The Bus-Conductor\", a fatal-crash premonition tale about a person haunted by a hearse driver, has been adapted several times, notably during 1944 (for the movie ''[[Dead of Night]]'' and as an anecdote in [[Bennett Cerf]]'s ''Ghost Stories'' anthology published the same year) and for a [[Twenty Two (The Twilight Zone)|1961 episode]] of ''[[The Twilight Zone]]''. The catchphrase from the story, \"Room for one more\", created a legend,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/horrors/ghosts/onemore.asp |title=Snopes entry on the urban legend based on the Benson story |website=Snopes.com |accessdate=2014-04-23}}</ref> and also occurs in the 1986 [[Oingo Boingo]] song, \"[[Dead Man's Party (song)|Dead Man's Party]]\".\n\nBenson's story ''David Blaize and the Blue Door'' (1918) is a children's fantasy influenced by the work of [[Lewis Carroll]].<ref>Morgan, Chris, \"E. F. Benson\" in, [[E. F. Bleiler]], ed. ''Supernatural Fiction Writers''. New York: Scribner's, 1985. pp.491\u2013496.  {{ISBN|0-684-17808-7}}</ref> \"Mr Tilly's Seance\" is a witty and amusing story about a man flattened by a traction-engine who finds himself dead and conscious on the 'other side'. Other notable stories are the eerie \"[[The Room in the Tower]]\" and \"Pirates\".\n\nBenson is also known for a series of biographies/autobiographies and memoirs, including one of [[Charlotte Bront\u00eb]]. His last book, delivered to his publisher ten days before his death, was an autobiography entitled ''Final Edition.''\n\n[[H. P. Lovecraft]] spoke well of Benson's works in his essay \"[[Supernatural Horror in Literature]]\", most notably of his story \"[[The Man Who Went Too Far]]\".\n\nFurther \"Mapp and Lucia\" books have been written by [[Tom Holt]], Guy Fraser-Sampson, and Ian Shepherd.\n\n==Links to Rye, East Sussex==\n[[File:Lamb House, Rye.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Lamb House, home of E. F. Benson and model for \"Mallards\" in the Lucia series.]]\nThe principal setting of four of the Mapp and Lucia books is a town named [[Tilling (Sussex)|Tilling]], which is recognizably based on [[Rye, East Sussex]], where Benson lived for many years and served as mayor from 1934 (he relocated there during 1918). Benson's home, [[Lamb House]], served as the model for Mallards, Mapp's \u2013 and ultimately Lucia's \u2013 home in some of the Tilling series. There really was a handsome \"Garden Room\" adjoining the street but it was destroyed by a bomb during the Second World War.<ref name=\"lambhouse\">{{cite web|title=Lamb House in Rye, East Sussex|url=http://www.ryesussex.co.uk/directory/45/lamb-house/|website=www.ryesussex.co.uk|accessdate=9 December 2016}}</ref> Lamb House attracted writers: it was earlier the home of [[Henry James]], and later of [[Rumer Godden]].\n\nHe donated a church window of the main parish church in Rye, St Mary's, in memory of his brother, as well as providing a gift of a viewing platform overlooking the Town Salts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tilling.org.uk/friendsoftilling/efbenson.html|title=E F Benson|author=|date=|website=www.tilling.org.uk|accessdate=10 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\n\nE. F. Benson is presumed to have been homosexual, but was intensely discreet.<ref>Aldrich, Robert ; Wotherspoon, Garry: ''Who's Who In Gay and Lesbian History: From Antiquity to World War II'', Routledge, p49</ref> At Cambridge he fell in love with several fellow students, including Vincent Yorke, father of the novelist [[Henry Vincent Yorke|Henry Yorke]], confiding to his diary \"I feel perfectly mad about him just now...Ah, if only he knew, and yet I think he does.\"<ref name=\"Masters 1992, p86\"/>  In later life Benson sustained friendships with wide circle of gay men, and shared a villa at [[Capri]] with [[John Ellingham Brooks]].<ref>Palmer, Geoffrey: ''E. F. Benson, As He Was'', Lennard Pub, 1988</ref> (Prior to the First World War the island was popular with wealthy homosexuals). Homoeroticism and a general homosexual sensibility suffuses his literary works, such as ''David Blaize'' (1916), while his most popular works are famed for their wry and dry camp humour and social observations.\n\nBenson was a good athlete, and represented England at [[figure skating]]. He was a precocious and prolific writer, publishing his first book while still a student.  Nowadays he is known principally for his [[Mapp and Lucia]] series about Emmeline \"Lucia\" Lucas and Elizabeth Mapp.\n\nIn London, Benson also lived at 395 [[Oxford Street]], [[London postal district|W1]] (now the branch of [[Russell & Bromley]] just west of [[Bond Street tube station|Bond Street Underground Station]]), 102 [[Oakley Street, Chelsea|Oakley Street]], [[London postal district|SW3]], and 25 [[Brompton Square]], [[London postal district|SW3]], where much of the action of ''Lucia in London'' occurs and where [[English Heritage]] placed a [[Blue Plaque]] during 1994.\n\n==Death==\nBenson died during 1940 of [[Head and neck cancer|throat cancer]] at the [[University College Hospital]], London.

F. Benson was born at [[Wellington College (Berkshire)|Wellington College]] in Berkshire, the fifth child of the headmaster, [[Edward White Benson]] (later [[Chancellor]] of [[Lincoln Cathedral]], [[Bishop of Truro]] and [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]), and his wife born [[Mary Benson (hostess)|Mary Sidgwick]] (\"Minnie\").\n\nE. F. Benson was the younger brother of [[A. C. Benson|Arthur Christopher Benson]], who wrote the words to \"[[Land of Hope and Glory]]\", [[Robert Hugh Benson]], author of several novels and Roman Catholic [[apologetic]] works, and [[Margaret Benson]] (Maggie), an author and amateur [[Egyptologist]]. Two other siblings died young. Benson's parents had six children and no grandchildren.\n\nBenson was educated at [[Temple Grove School]], then at [[Marlborough College]], where he wrote some of his earliest works and upon which he based his novel ''[[David Blaize]]''.  He continued his education at [[King's College, Cambridge]].<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{acad|id=BN887EF |name=Benson, Edward Frederic}}</ref> At Cambridge, he was a member of the [[Pitt Club]],<ref>{{cite book |last1=Benson |first1=Edward Frederic |authorlink1=E.F.

Benson wrote in his diary: \"I feel perfectly mad about him just now...Ah, if only he knew, and yet I think he does.\"<ref name=\"Masters 1992, p86\">Masters, Brian \"The Life Of E.F. Benson\", Chatto & Windus, 1992, p86</ref>\n\n==Works==\n[[File:Title Page of Miss Mapp.png|thumb|right|190px|Title page of ''Miss Mapp'', 1922.]]\n\nBenson's first book published was ''Sketches From Marlborough''.  He started his novel writing career with the (then) fashionably controversial ''Dodo'' (1893), which was an instant success, and followed it with a variety of satire \nand romantic and supernatural melodrama. He repeated the success of ''Dodo'', which featured a scathing description of composer and militant suffragette [[Ethel Smyth]] (which she \"gleefully acknowledged\", according to actress [[Prunella Scales]]{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}), with the same cast of characters a generation later: ''Dodo the Second'' (1914), \"a unique chronicle of the pre-1914 [[Bright Young People|Bright Young Things]]\" and ''Dodo Wonders'' (1921), \"a first-hand [[social history]] of the [[World War I|Great War]] in [[Mayfair]] and the [[Shire]]s\".<ref>Introduction by Prunella Scales to ''Dodo: An Omnibus''. Introduction in 1986 edition from The Hogarth Press. Original publication of novels 1893, 1914, 1921.</ref> The [[Mapp and Lucia]] series, written relatively late in his career, consists of six novels and two short stories. The novels are: ''Queen Lucia'', ''Lucia in London'', ''Miss Mapp'', ''Mapp and Lucia'', ''Lucia's Progress'' (published as ''The Worshipful Lucia'' in the United States) and ''Trouble for Lucia''.  The short stories are \"The Male Impersonator\" and \"Desirable Residences\". Both appear in anthologies of Benson's short stories, and the former is also often appended to the end of the novel ''Miss Mapp''.\n\nIn February 1983 [[BBC Radio 4]] broadcast ''Trouble for Lucia'' \u2014 a 12-part adaptation by [[Aubrey Woods]] of the first four novels. In April and May 2007 [[BBC Radio 4]] broadcast ''Mapp and Lucia'' \u2014 a ten-part adaptation by [[Ned Sherrin]]. In 2008 [[BBC Radio 4]] broadcast ''Lucia's Progress'' \u2014 a five-part dramatisation by John Peacock of the fifth novel.\n\nThe last three novels were dramatised by [[Gerald Savory]] for a ten-episode TV series produced by [[London Weekend Television]] and broadcast in two five-part runs between 1985 and 1986 on the then recently launched [[Channel 4]]. Titled ''Mapp and Lucia'', the series featured [[Geraldine McEwan]] as Lucia, [[Prunella Scales]] as Mapp and [[Nigel Hawthorne]] as Georgie. In 2007 the British channel [[ITV3]] broadcast the 1985\u201386 series. A three-part dramatisation by [[Steve Pemberton]] \u2014 starring [[Miranda Richardson]] as Mapp, [[Anna Chancellor]] as Lucia and [[Steve Pemberton]] as Georgie \u2014 was broadcast on [[BBC One]] over consecutive evenings between 29 and 31 December 2014.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/proginfo/2014/52/mapp-and-lucia |title=New adaptation of E.&nbsp;F. Benson's 'Mapp and Lucia' on BBC1 | date=21 Dec 2014}}</ref>\n\nBenson was also known as a writer of atmospheric and at times humorous or satirical [[Ghost story|ghost stories]], which were often first published in story magazines such as ''[[Pearson's Magazine]]'' or ''Hutchinson's Magazine'', 20 of which were illustrated by [[Edmund Blampied]].  These \"spook stories\", as they were also termed, were then reprinted in collections by his principal publisher, [[Hutchinson (publisher)|Walter Hutchinson]]. His 1906 short story, \"The Bus-Conductor\", a fatal-crash premonition tale about a person haunted by a hearse driver, has been adapted several times, notably during 1944 (for the movie ''[[Dead of Night]]'' and as an anecdote in [[Bennett Cerf]]'s ''Ghost Stories'' anthology published the same year) and for a [[Twenty Two (The Twilight Zone)|1961 episode]] of ''[[The Twilight Zone]]''. The catchphrase from the story, \"Room for one more\", created a legend,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/horrors/ghosts/onemore.asp |title=Snopes entry on the urban legend based on the Benson story |website=Snopes.com |accessdate=2014-04-23}}</ref> and also occurs in the 1986 [[Oingo Boingo]] song, \"[[Dead Man's Party (song)|Dead Man's Party]]\".\n\nBenson's story ''David Blaize and the Blue Door'' (1918) is a children's fantasy influenced by the work of [[Lewis Carroll]].<ref>Morgan, Chris, \"E. F. Benson\" in, [[E. F. Bleiler]], ed. ''Supernatural Fiction Writers''. New York: Scribner's, 1985. pp.491\u2013496.  {{ISBN|0-684-17808-7}}</ref> \"Mr Tilly's Seance\" is a witty and amusing story about a man flattened by a traction-engine who finds himself dead and conscious on the 'other side'. Other notable stories are the eerie \"[[The Room in the Tower]]\" and \"Pirates\".\n\nBenson is also known for a series of biographies/autobiographies and memoirs, including one of [[Charlotte Bront\u00eb]]. His last book, delivered to his publisher ten days before his death, was an autobiography entitled ''Final Edition.''\n\n[[H. P. Lovecraft]] spoke well of Benson's works in his essay \"[[Supernatural Horror in Literature]]\", most notably of his story \"[[The Man Who Went Too Far]]\".\n\nFurther \"Mapp and Lucia\" books have been written by [[Tom Holt]], Guy Fraser-Sampson, and Ian Shepherd.\n\n==Links to Rye, East Sussex==\n[[File:Lamb House, Rye.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Lamb House, home of E. F. Benson and model for \"Mallards\" in the Lucia series.]]\nThe principal setting of four of the Mapp and Lucia books is a town named [[Tilling (Sussex)|Tilling]], which is recognizably based on [[Rye, East Sussex]], where Benson lived for many years and served as mayor from 1934 (he relocated there during 1918). Benson's home, [[Lamb House]], served as the model for Mallards, Mapp's \u2014 and ultimately Lucia's \u2014 home in some of the Tilling series. There really was a handsome \"Garden Room\" adjoining the street but it was destroyed by a bomb during the Second World War.<ref name=\"lambhouse\">{{cite web|title=Lamb House in Rye, East Sussex|url=http://www.ryesussex.co.uk/directory/45/lamb-house/|website=www.ryesussex.co.uk|accessdate=9 December 2016}}</ref> Lamb House attracted writers: it was earlier the home of [[Henry James]], and later of [[Rumer Godden]].\n\nHe donated a church window of the main parish church in Rye, St Mary's, in memory of his brother, as well as providing a gift of a viewing platform overlooking the Town Salts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tilling.org.uk/friendsoftilling/efbenson.html|title=E F Benson|author=|date=|website=www.tilling.org.uk|accessdate=10 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\n\nE. F. Benson is presumed to have been homosexual, but was intensely discreet.<ref>Aldrich, Robert ; Wotherspoon, Garry: ''Who's Who In Gay and Lesbian History: From Antiquity to World War II'', Routledge, p49</ref> At Cambridge he fell in love with several fellow students, including Vincent Yorke, father of the novelist [[Henry Vincent Yorke|Henry Yorke]], confiding to his diary \"I feel perfectly mad about him just now...Ah, if only he knew, and yet I think he does.\"<ref name=\"Masters 1992, p86\"/>  In later life Benson sustained friendships with wide circle of gay men, and shared a villa at [[Capri]] with [[John Ellingham Brooks]].<ref>Palmer, Geoffrey: ''E. F. Benson, As He Was'', Lennard Pub, 1988</ref> (Prior to the First World War the island was popular with wealthy homosexuals). Homoeroticism and a general homosexual sensibility suffuses his literary works, such as ''David Blaize'' (1916), while his most popular works are famed for their wry and dry camp humour and social observations.\n\nBenson was a good athlete, and represented England at [[figure skating]]. He was a precocious and prolific writer, publishing his first book while still a student.  Nowadays he is known principally for his [[Mapp and Lucia]] series about Emmeline \"Lucia\" Lucas and Elizabeth Mapp.\n\nIn London, Benson also lived at 395 [[Oxford Street]], [[London postal district|W1]] (now the branch of [[Russell & Bromley]] just west of [[Bond Street tube station|Bond Street Underground Station]]), 102 [[Oakley Street, Chelsea|Oakley Street]], [[London postal district|SW3]], and 25 [[Brompton Square]], [[London postal district|SW3]], where much of the action of ''Lucia in London'' occurs and where [[English Heritage]] placed a [[Blue Plaque]] during 1994.\n\n==Death==\nBenson died during 1940 of [[Head and neck cancer|throat cancer]] at the [[University College Hospital]], London. He is buried in the cemetery at [[Rye, East Sussex]].\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n===Mapp and Lucia===\nAlso known as the '''Make Way For Lucia''' series\n* ''[[Queen Lucia]]'' (1920)\n* ''[[Miss Mapp]]'' (1922 [UK]; published in the United States 1923)\n* ''[[Lucia in London]]'' (1927 [UK]; published in the United States 1928)\n* ''[[Mapp and Lucia (novel)|Mapp and Lucia]]'' (1931)\n* ''[[Lucia's Progress]]'' (1935; published in the United States as ''The Worshipful Lucia'')\n* ''[[Trouble for Lucia]]'' (1939)\n\n===Other novels===\n* ''[[Dodo: A Detail of the Day]]'' (1893)\n* ''[[The Rubicon (novel)|The Rubicon]]'' (1894)\n* ''[[The Judgement Books]]'' (novella, 1895)\n* ''[[Limitations (Benson novel)|Limitations]]'' (1896)\n* ''[[The Babe, B.A.]]'' (1897)\n* ''[[The Money Market]]'' (1898)\n* ''[[The Vintage (novel)|The Vintage]]'' (1898)\n* ''[[The Capsina]]'' (1899)\n* ''[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/40797 Mammon and Co.]'' (1899)\n* ''[http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/007685898 The Princess Sophia]'' (1900)\n* ''[http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/000472505 The Luck of the Vails]'' (1901)\n* ''[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/40795 Scarlet and Hyssop]'' (1902)\n* ''[http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/008664101 An Act in a Backwater]'' (1903)\n* ''[https://archive.org/details/bookofmonths00bens The Book of Months]'' (1903)\n* ''[http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/006155607 The Relentless City]'' (1903)\n* ''The Valkyries'' (1903)\n* [https://archive.org/stream/challoners00bens#page/n5/mode/2up ''The Challoners''] (1904)\n* ''[http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/009782790 The Angel of Pain]'' (1905 [USA]; published in the UK 1906)\n* ''[https://archive.org/details/imageinsand00bensgoog The Image in the Sand]'' (1905)\n* [https://archive.org/stream/housedefence02bensgoog#page/n6/mode/2up ''The House of Defence''] (1906)\n* ''[http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/008664204 Paul]'' (1906)\n* ''[http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/007653180 Sheaves]'' (1907)\n* ''[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11493 The Blotting Book]'' (1908)\n* [https://archive.org/stream/climberbenson00bensiala#page/n7/mode/2up ''The Climber''] (1908)\n* ''[https://archive.org/details/reapingaben00bensuoft A Reaping]'' (1909)\n* ''[http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/webbin/gutbook/lookup?num=28999 Daisy's Aunt]'' (1910; published in the United States [1910] as ''The Fascinating Mrs. Halton'' qv)\n* ''[http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/008667182 Margery]'' (1910; published in the UK [1911] as ''Juggernaut'' qv)\n* ''[http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/007653178 The Osbornes]'' (1910)\n* [https://archive.org/stream/fascinatingmrsh00bensgoog#page/n10/mode/2up ''The Fascinating Mrs. Halton''] (originally published in the UK [1910] as ''Daisy's Aunt'' qv)\n* ''[http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/008664093 Account Rendered]'' (1911)<ref>{{cite journal|title=Review: ''Account Rendered'' by E.
