With the exception of ''[[Hesperonychus]]'' from the late [[Cretaceous]] of North America, all microraptorians have been found in the [[Yixian Formation|Yixian]] and [[Jiufotang Formation|Jifuotang]] Formations of Liaoning county, China, hence why microraptorians are sometimes referred to as \"Liaoning dromaeosaurs\". These formations (collectively known as the [[Jehol group]]) have been dated to the early Cretaceous and at that time would have been part of a temperate wetland ecosystem threatened by frequent volcanic eruptions. Like other dromaeosaurids, microraptorians were carnivores with relatively large, serrated teeth and an hyper-extendable second toe equipped with a curved claw.\n\n===Size and proportions===\n[[File:Changyuraptor.png|thumb|A life restoration of ''[[Changyuraptor]]'', a large \"four-winged\" microraptorine|300x300px]]\nMost microraptorians were small dinosaurs, with taxa like ''[[Microraptor]]'' and especially ''[[Zhongjianosaurus]]'' being among the smallest non-avian dinosaurs known. However, some microraptorians, such as ''[[Tianyuraptor]]'' and ''[[Changyuraptor]]'', were larger and similar to other dromaeosaurids in size. Many microraptorians also had long and robust arms and legs, in contrast to the stockier [[Eudromaeosauria|eudromaeosaurs]], although long arms are not universal to the group since the basal microraptorian ''Tianyuraptor'' had unusually short arms by dromaeosaurid standards.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Zheng|first=Xiaoting|last2=Xu|first2=Xing|last3=You|first3=Hailu|last4=Zhao|first4=Qi|last5=Dong|first5=Zhiming|date=2010-01-22|title=A short-armed dromaeosaurid from the Jehol Group of China with implications for early dromaeosaurid evolution|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences|language=en|volume=277|issue=1679|pages=211\u2013217|doi=10.1098/rspb.2009.1178|issn=0962-8452|pmid=19692406|pmc=2842677}}</ref> Considering this, it is likely that the small size and long wings of some microraptorians are an example of convergent evolution with other small [[Paraves|paravians]] and early birds such as ''[[Anchiornis]]'' and ''[[Archaeopteryx]]''.\n\n===Feathers===\nThe fossilization conditions of the Jehol group are very accommodating to the preservation of soft structures in fossils, and as a result many microraptorians have been preserved with a covering of feathers. Not only have long, advanced feathers been preserved on the arms and tails of many specimens, but a few species even have long feathers on their legs. This condition has also been seen in other paravians such as ''Anchiornis'', and has caused these kinds of dinosaurs to be labelled as \"four-winged dinosaurs\". The largest known \"four-winged\" dinosaur, ''[[Changyuraptor]],'' is a microraptorian. It is possible that some microraptorians such as ''[[Microraptor]]'' were able to use these wings to glide or take off from the ground.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Han|first=Gang|last2=Chiappe|first2=Luis M.|last3=Ji|first3=Shu-An|last4=Habib|first4=Michael|last5=Turner|first5=Alan H.|last6=Chinsamy|first6=Anusuya|last7=Liu|first7=Xueling|last8=Han|first8=Lizhuo|date=2014-07-15|title=A new raptorial dinosaur with exceptionally long feathering provides insights into dromaeosaurid flight performance|journal=Nature Communications|language=en|volume=5|pages=ncomms5382|doi=10.1038/ncomms5382|pmid=25025742}}</ref><ref name=\"Dececchi, T.A. 2016 PMC\"/>\n\n===Characteristic features<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Longrich|first=Nicholas R.|last2=Currie|first2=Philip J.|date=2009-03-31|title=A microraptorine (Dinosauria\u2013Dromaeosauridae) from the Late Cretaceous of North America|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=106|issue=13|pages=5002\u20135007|doi=10.1073/pnas.0811664106|issn=0027-8424|pmid=19289829|pmc=2664043}}</ref>===\nMicroraptorines can be distinguished from other dromaeosaurids due to the following features:\n* A [[maxilla]] laterally sculpted by small pits.\n* A very short manual [[Phalanx bone|phalanx]] III-2.\n* A shortened first digit of the hand.\n* A splatulate (rounded) [[pubic symphysis]].\n* A [[Metatarsal bones|metatarsal]] III with a pinched proximal end.\n* A slender metatarsal II.\nIn addition, several features are present in microraptorines with the exception of ''Tianyuraptor'', which is believed to be a basal member of the clade:\n* A large oval fenestra in the [[coracoid]].\n* Significantly shortened penultimate manual phalanges.\n* The posterior end of the [[Ilium (bone)|ilium]] extending ventral to the ischial peduncle.\n* Lateral projections halfway down the [[Pubis (bone)|pubis]].\n* A strongly anteriorly curved pubic shaft.\n\n==Classification==\nMicroraptoria is usually classified as a clade of [[Dromaeosauridae|dromaeosaurids]].

With the exception of ''[[Hesperonychus]]'' from the late [[Cretaceous]] of North America, all microraptorians have been found in the [[Yixian Formation|Yixian]] and [[Jiufotang Formation|Jifuotang]] Formations of Liaoning county, China, hence why microraptorians are sometimes referred to as \"Liaoning dromaeosaurs\". These formations (collectively known as the [[Jehol group]]) have been dated to the early Cretaceous and at that time would have been part of a temperate wetland ecosystem threatened by frequent volcanic eruptions. Like other dromaeosaurids, microraptorians were carnivores with relatively large, serrated teeth and an hyper-extendable second toe equipped with a curved claw.\n\n===Size and proportions===\n[[File:Changyuraptor.png|thumb|A life restoration of ''[[Changyuraptor]]'', a large \"four-winged\" microraptorine|300x300px]]\nMost microraptorians were small dinosaurs, with taxa like ''[[Microraptor]]'' and especially ''[[Zhongjianosaurus]]'' being among the smallest non-avian dinosaurs known. However, some microraptorians, such as ''[[Tianyuraptor]]'' and ''[[Changyuraptor]]'', were larger and similar to other dromaeosaurids in size. Many microraptorians also had long and robust arms and legs, in contrast to the stockier [[Eudromaeosauria|eudromaeosaurs]], although long arms are not universal to the group since the basal microraptorian ''Tianyuraptor'' had unusually short arms by dromaeosaurid standards.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Zheng|first=Xiaoting|last2=Xu|first2=Xing|last3=You|first3=Hailu|last4=Zhao|first4=Qi|last5=Dong|first5=Zhiming|date=2010-01-22|title=A short-armed dromaeosaurid from the Jehol Group of China with implications for early dromaeosaurid evolution|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences|language=en|volume=277|issue=1679|pages=211\u2013217|doi=10.1098/rspb.2009.1178|issn=0962-8452|pmid=19692406|pmc=2842677}}</ref> Considering this, it is likely that the small size and long wings of some microraptorians are an example of convergent evolution with other small [[Paraves|paravians]] and early birds such as ''[[Anchiornis]]'' and ''[[Archaeopteryx]]''.\n\n===Feathers===\nThe fossilization conditions of the Jehol group are very accommodating to the preservation of soft structures in fossils, and as a result many microraptorians have been preserved with a covering of feathers. Not only have long, advanced feathers been preserved on the arms and tails of many specimens, but a few species even have long feathers on their legs. This condition has also been seen in other paravians such as ''Anchiornis'', and has caused these kinds of dinosaurs to be labelled as \"four-winged dinosaurs\". The largest known \"four-winged\" dinosaur, ''[[Changyuraptor]],'' is a microraptorian. It is possible that some microraptorians such as ''[[Microraptor]]'' were able to use these wings to glide or take off from the ground.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Han|first=Gang|last2=Chiappe|first2=Luis M.|last3=Ji|first3=Shu-An|last4=Habib|first4=Michael|last5=Turner|first5=Alan H.|last6=Chinsamy|first6=Anusuya|last7=Liu|first7=Xueling|last8=Han|first8=Lizhuo|date=2014-07-15|title=A new raptorial dinosaur with exceptionally long feathering provides insights into dromaeosaurid flight performance|journal=Nature Communications|language=en|volume=5|pages=ncomms5382|doi=10.1038/ncomms5382|pmid=25025742}}</ref><ref name=\"Dececchi, T.A. 2016 PMC\"/>\n\n===Characteristic features<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Longrich|first=Nicholas R.|last2=Currie|first2=Philip J.|date=2009-03-31|title=A microraptorine (Dinosauria\u2013Dromaeosauridae) from the Late Cretaceous of North America|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=106|issue=13|pages=5002\u20135007|doi=10.1073/pnas.0811664106|issn=0027-8424|pmid=19289829|pmc=2664043}}</ref>===\nMicroraptorines can be distinguished from other dromaeosaurids due to the following features:\n* A [[maxilla]] laterally sculpted by small pits.\n* A very short manual [[Phalanx bone|phalanx]] III-2.\n* A shortened first digit of the hand.\n* A splatulate (rounded) [[pubic symphysis]].\n* A [[Metatarsal bones|metatarsal]] III with a pinched proximal end.\n* A slender metatarsal II.\nIn addition, several features are present in microraptorines with the exception of ''Tianyuraptor'', which is believed to be a basal member of the clade:\n* A large oval fenestra in the [[coracoid]].\n* Significantly shortened penultimate manual phalanges.\n* The posterior end of the [[Ilium (bone)|ilium]] extending ventral to the ischial peduncle.\n* Lateral projections halfway down the [[Pubis (bone)|pubis]].\n* A strongly anteriorly curved pubic shaft.\n\n==Classification==\nMicroraptoria is usually classified as a clade of [[Dromaeosauridae|dromaeosaurids]].

He was temporarily engulfed in flames on three occasions when the pyrotechnics were mistimed and his jacket briefly caught on fire. He suffered first and second-degree burns to his neck and chest and according to a WWE spokesperson the injury \"looked like a bad sunburn\". He was only allowed to participate in the match after being cleared by a ringside doctor and was given bottles of water throughout the match to douse himself with to alleviate the discomfort.\n\n== Match ==\n=== Rules ===\nThe Elimination Chamber match is a variation of elimination-based matches which draws elements from steel cage and Hell in a Cell matches in that the [[wrestling ring]] is surrounded by a large steel-fenced cage supported by [[girder]]s. Originally, its design was a circular-like chain-linked structure, but since 2017 it is now square and encloses the ring. Its floor is platformed over the ringside area around the ring which elevates and levels it with the ring mat. Within the Elimination Chamber, four enclosures, referred to as inner chambers or pods, are encased in [[plexiglass]] and face the outside of each ring post.<ref name=\"Description\"/> The match is contested by six or seven participants: two or three starting in the ring, while the other four are held within each inner chamber.<ref name=\"ECMatch\"/> The [[Elimination Chamber (2018)|Elimination Chamber]] in February 2018 featured a seven-man chamber match in which three participants began. Every five minutes, one of the four participants within an inner chamber enters the match. This continues until all four have been released, meaning an Elimination Chamber match typically lasts over twenty or more minutes.<ref name=\"ECMatch\"/> \n\nThe objective of the match is to eliminate each opponent from the match by scoring a [[Pin (professional wrestling)|pinfall]] or a [[Submission (combat sport)|submission]]. These can occur in the ring or on the chamber's elevated floor, but starting with the 2012 event all pinfalls and submissions must take place within the ring. Disqualifications and count-outs do not apply in the process of elimination. The winner of the match is the last remaining participant after all others have been eliminated (or after all members of the opposing tag team are eliminated in either the tag team matches or the twelve-on-twelve tornado tag team elimination matches).<ref name=\"ECMatch\" /> The same rules apply when the match involves six tag teams where two teams start in the ring and a new team leaves the pod enters the ring after every five minutes.<ref name=\"ECMatch\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/specialtymatches/eliminationchamber|title=Specialty Matches: Elimination Chamber|publisher=World Wrestling Entertainment|accessdate=6 February 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080224045708/http://www.wwe.com/inside/specialtymatches/eliminationchamber|archivedate=24 February 2008}}</ref>\n\n=== Structure ===\n[[File:WWE_Elimination_Chamber_2017.jpg|thumb|200px|The current alteration of the Elimination Chamber structure was introduced at the [[Elimination Chamber (2017)|Elimination Chamber]] event in February 2017]]\nAccording to a ''[[WWE Magazine]]'' article in 2009 by WWE's [[production designer]] Jason Robinson, who co-designed the structure, several designs for the Elimination Chamber were considered. The structure was manufactured in [[Colorado Springs, Colorado]] and took six to eight weeks to make from design blueprints. It cost [[United States dollar|US$]] 250,000 to construct.<ref name=\"WWEMag-Design\">{{cite journal|last=Robinson|first=Jason|date=January 2009|title=Cold Steel|journal=[[WWE Magazine]]|pages=pg. 49}}</ref>\n\nThe structure is made of black-painted steel with an outer structure of 16 frames, each weighing {{Convert|300|lb|kg}}.<ref name=\"WWEMag-Design\" /> The chamber is {{convert|16|ft|m|abbr=on}} high and {{Convert|36|ft|m|abbr=on}} in diameter and weighs a total of {{convert|16|ST|kg|abbr=on}}, 10 of which consists of steel.<ref name=\"WWEMag-Design\" /><ref name=\"Almanac\">{{cite news|title=2007 Wrestling Almanac & Book of Facts|work= Wrestling\u2019s Historical Cards|publisher=Kappa Publishing|year=2007|pages=119}}</ref><ref name=\"ECMatch\"/> Each inner chamber consists of three large steel framed sheets of [[Poly(methyl methacrylate)|plexiglass]], costing US$225 per sheet.<ref name=\"WWEMag-Design\"/> The chains that surround the chamber stretch {{Convert|2|mi|km|abbr=on}} long and weigh {{convert|6|ST|kg|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"Almanac\" /><ref name=\"ECMatch\"/>\n\nA {{convert|50|ft|m|abbr=on}} flatbed truck is needed to transport the chamber. Assembly in the arena takes eight hours to complete and eight motors are used to suspend the structure over the ring before each event.<ref name=\"WWEMag-Design\"/> When not in use, the structure is stored at a dock in [[Newark, New Jersey]].<ref name=\"WWEMag-Design\"/> Unlike standard steel cage matches and Hell in a Cell matches, Elimination Chamber matches cannot be held at several arenas due to the structure's massive size and weight, similar to how [[WarGames match]]es could only be held at certain arenas. This would play a factor in WWE dropping the annual Elimination Chamber event.<ref name=Steph>{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestlezone.com/news/543179-stephanie-mcmahon-reveals-the-real-reason-why-wwe-dropped-the-elimination-chamber-ppv|title=Stephanie McMahon Reveals the Real Reason Why WWE Dropped the Elimination Chamber PPV|last=Paglino|first=Nick|date=January 15, 2015|website=Wrestlezone|publisher=Evolve Media|access-date=February 5, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 2017, the Elimination Chamber event returned (2017's event was SmackDown-exclusive while 2018's was Raw-exclusive). In addition, the chamber structure was redesigned, becoming square instead of circular. The pods were also changed from circular to square and feature sliding doors that referees slide open from outside the chamber. At the top of the chamber at its center which is now {{convert|26|ft|m|abbr=on}} tall is a large cutout of the WWE logo. The steel grates between the ring and the cage were also replaced with padding. LED lights also line the corners of the structure. The redesign was for practical purposes due to certain venues only being able to house the previous structure, allowing most venues to host the Chamber.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://heavy.com/news/2017/02/how-the-new-wwe-elimination-chamber-design-compares-compared-to-old-previous-one-photos-dimensions/|title=How the New WWE Elimination Chamber Design Compares to the Old One|date=February 12, 2017|last=Morrow|first=Brendan|work=[[Heavy.com]]|accessdate=February 13, 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Variations ===\nThe fifth match, held by the [[ECW (WWE brand)|ECW]] brand at [[December to Dismember (2006)|December to Dismember]], was a slight variation called the [[Hardcore wrestling|Extreme]] Elimination Chamber.<ref name=\"ECWChamber\">{{cite web|url= http://www.wwe.com/shows/decembertodismember/matches/32934421/results/|accessdate=2 February 2008|title=Mission Accomplished|last=Tello| first=Craig|publisher=World Wrestling Entertainment|date=3 December 2006}}</ref> In this variation, each chamber had one of four [[foreign object (professional wrestling)|weapons]] for the competitors locked inside to hold on to.

Both team members were inside of their respective pods, for a total of six tag teams in the match. This match was for the [[WWE Raw Tag Team Championship|WWE Tag Team Championship]]. This variation was repeated in 2019, but for women and to determine the inaugural holders of the [[WWE Women's Tag Team Championship]].\n\nThe 2018 Elimination Chamber featured the first seven-man chamber match. Due to the extra person, three competitors started the match instead of two. The 2018 event also featured the first women's chamber match, but there were no variations in the rules.\n\n=== Interference ===\nDespite the structure, interference has become common inside the Elimination Chamber. At [[New Year's Revolution (2005)|New Year's Revolution]] in January 2005, [[Ric Flair]] distracted guest referee [[Shawn Michaels]]. allowing [[Dave Bautista|Batista]] who had been eliminated to attack [[Randy Orton]] so [[Triple H]] could win the match. At [[No Way Out (2009)|No Way Out]] in February 2009, [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]] attacked [[Kofi Kingston]] during his entrance and locked himself in one of the pods becoming a participant in the match for the [[World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)|World Heavyweight Championship]] after losing the [[WWE Championship]] earlier in the night. At [[Elimination Chamber (2010)|Elimination Chamber]] in February 2010, [[Cody Rhodes]] passed [[Ted DiBiase Jr.]] a metal pipe which he used to eliminate Randy Orton in the match for the WWE Championship. Later in the night, Shawn Michaels broke into the chamber to cost [[The Undertaker]] his World Heavyweight Championship to [[Chris Jericho]]. At the [[Elimination Chamber (2013)|Elimination Chamber]] event in February 2013, [[Mark Henry]] took out the remaining participants in the chamber for a World Heavyweight Championship match at [[WrestleMania 29]] after being eliminated until [[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown]] General Manager [[Booker T (wrestler)|Booker T]] broke it up. At the [[Elimination Chamber (2014)|Elimination Chamber]] for the [[WWE World Heavyweight Championship]] in February 2014, [[The Wyatt Family]] interfered by attacking [[John Cena]], leading to his eventual elimination  by Randy Orton. [[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]] would then come out to help escort The Wyatt Family out of the chamber, but would then interfere to cost [[Daniel Bryan]] the match to Orton.\n\n=== Match history ===\nThe Elimination Chamber debuted at WWE's event [[Survivor Series (2002)|Survivor Series]] at [[Madison Square Garden]] in November 2002.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wwe.com/shows/eliminationchamber/10-best-elimination-chamber-matches|title=Which brutal Elimination Chamber Match stands above the rest?|website=WWE|language=en|access-date=2020-03-26}}</ref> Since the inaugural match, there have been 25 other matches (26 overall) as of [[Elimination Chamber (2020)|Elimination Chamber]] in March 2020. The [[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]] brand has been featured the most with twelve matches, including its [[Elimination Chamber (2019)|joint-branded match]] with [[SmackDown (WWE brand)|SmackDown]]. [[ECW (WWE brand)|ECW]] has been featured in two matches, including its [[No Way Out (2008)|joint-branded match]] with SmackDown. The SmackDown brand has been featured in eight matches, including the joint-branded matches with both ECW and Raw. The [[WWE Elimination Chamber|Elimination Chamber]] event has featured more Elimination Chamber matches than any other [[List of WWE pay-per-view events|WWE pay-per-view event]], with seventeen matches being held. [[Triple H]] has the most number of victories with four. [[Chris Jericho]] holds the distinctions of being involved in the most number of Elimination Chamber matches to date (8) and eliminating the most wrestlers (10).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wwe.com/shows/eliminationchamber/by-the-numbers|title=Elimination Chamber: by the numbers|website=WWE|language=en|access-date=2020-03-26}}</ref> [[Braun Strowman]] and [[Shayna Baszler]] have the most eliminations in a single Elimination Chamber match (5); Baszler is also the only winner to eliminate all other opponents in a single match.\n\nThe majority of matches have been contested for a top-tier championship with the [[World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)|World Heavyweight Championship]] and [[WWE Championship]] (once as the WWE World Heavyweight Championship) being contested for the most in seven matches each and the [[ECW World Championship]], [[WWE Raw Tag Team Championship|WWE Tag Team Championship]], [[WWE SmackDown Tag Team Championship|SmackDown Tag Team Championship]], [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|Intercontinental Championship]], and [[WWE Raw Women's Championship|Raw Women's Championship]] being contested in one match each. Six matches (two in 2008 and one in 2011, 2013, 2018, and 2020) awarded the winners the number-one contendership for the WWE Championship, World Heavyweight Championship, [[WWE Universal Championship]], and Raw Women's Championship, respectively, at those years' [[WrestleMania]]. The Elimination Chamber match has been contested only in [[indoor arena]]s in the United States and once in Puerto Rico. From 2008 to 2014, the match had been featured in February pay-per-view events only. An Elimination Chamber pay-per-view event took place on May 31, 2015 exclusively on the [[WWE Network]]. The [[Elimination Chamber (2018)|Elimination Chamber]] in February 2018 featured the first seven-man Elimination Chamber match as well as the first Elimination Chamber match for women with the Raw Women's Championship contested. The [[Elimination Chamber (2019)|Elimination Chamber]] in February 2019 featured a tag team Elimination Chamber match, the second overall tag team chamber match, but this time for women to determine the inaugural holders of the [[WWE Women's Tag Team Championship]].\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: auto\"\n|-\n|style=\"background:#FBB; width:2em\"|\n|[[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw brand]]\n|style=\"background:#BBF; width:2em\"|\n|[[SmackDown (WWE brand)|SmackDown brand]]\n|style=\"background:#DDD; width:2em\"|\n|[[ECW (WWE brand)|ECW brand]]\n|}\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"100%\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!width=\"1%\"|Number\n!width=\"5\"%|Brand\n!width=\"19%\"|Prize\n!width=\"30%\" class=\"unsortable\"|Result\n!width=\"10%\"|Date\n!width=\"12%\"|Event\n!width=\"10%\"|Location\n!width=\"1%\" class=\"unsortable\"|Ref.\n!width=\"1%\" class=\"unsortable\"|Length\n|-\n|{{sort|01|1}}\n|style=\"background-color: #FBB;\" align=\"center\"|[[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]]\n|style=\"background-color: #FBB;\" align=\"center\"|[[World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)|World Heavyweight Championship]]\n|style=\"background-color: #FBB;\" align=\"center\"|[[Shawn Michaels]] defeated [[Triple H]] (c), [[Chris Jericho]], [[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]], [[Booker T (wrestler)|Booker T]], and [[Rob Van Dam]]\n|{{dts|2002|11|17}}\n|[[Survivor Series (2002)|Survivor Series]]\n|[[New York City|New York City, New York]]\n|<ref name=\"Survivor Series 2002\">{{cite web |url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/survivorseries/history/2002/mainevent/ |accessdate=3 February 2008 |title=Survivor Series 2002 \u2013 Elimination Chamber match |publisher=World Wrestling Entertainment |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080221171201/http://www.wwe.com/shows/survivorseries/history/2002/mainevent/ |archivedate=21 February 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wrestleview.com/news/1037591979.shtml|title=Full WWE Survivor Series Results -

The objective is to eliminate each opponent from the match via [[Pin (professional wrestling)|pinfall]] or [[Submission (combat sport)|submission]]. The winner is the last remaining participant after all others have been eliminated. As in the Hell in a Cell match, disqualifications do not apply.

The steel cage was the first type of cage-based match in professional wrestling and consisted of four fenced walls of steel surrounding the [[wrestling ring|ring apron]] while the Hell in a Cell was a taller roofed version that surrounded the ring and ringside area on the ground rather than the apron. In 2002, WWE announced the creation of the Elimination Chamber, a match that combined elements of WWE's [[Hell in a Cell|Hell in a Cell matches]], [[Royal Rumble#Match|Royal Rumble match]], [[Survivor Series#Survivor Series matches|Survivor Series matches]] and [[World Championship Wrestling]]'s (WCW) [[WarGames match]]es,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/listthis/mostextremematches/mostextremematches7|title=Ragin' Cagin' at War Games|publisher=World Wrestling Entertainment|first=Lennie|last=DiFino|date=21 April 2009|accessdate=9 February 2011}}</ref> such as the [[countdown]] timer and time intervals from the Royal Rumble and War Games matches, the large enclosed cage format of both Hell in a Cell and War Games and the elimination process from the Survivor Series contest.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://uk.sports.ign.com/articles/454/454029p1.html|title=WWE Smackdown Top 10: #10: The Elimination Chamber.|publisher=[[IGN]]|first=Jon|last=Robinson|date=9 October 2003|accessdate=9 February 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713004602/http://uk.sports.ign.com/articles/454/454029p1.html|archive-date=13 July 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n=== Brand and pay-per-view designation ===\n[[File:Kane With A Sidewalk Slam.jpg|thumb|250px|The Raw brand Elimination Chamber match in January 2006]]\nTo exploit additional on-screen talent after buying [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) in March 2001, the following year WWE began a [[WWE brand extension|brand extension]] that divided the roster between the two brands of WWE, namely [[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]] and [[SmackDown (WWE brand)|SmackDown]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://corporate.wwe.com/news/2002/2002_03_27.jsp |title=WWE To Make RAW and SMACKDOWN Distinct Television Brands |publisher=[[WWE]] |accessdate=6 February 2011 |date=27 March 2002 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100417115226/http://corporate.wwe.com/news/2002/2002_03_27.jsp |archivedate=17 April 2010 }}</ref> Former WCW President and then Raw [[Professional wrestling authority figures#General Managers|General Manager]] [[Eric Bischoff]] formally announced the creation of the chamber during the October 21 episode of ''[[WWE Raw|Raw]]'' and scheduled the match to feature participants from the Raw brand roster at the [[Survivor Series (2002)|Survivor Series]] in November 2002.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wrestleview.com/news/1035288452.shtml|title=Full WWE RAW Results - 10/21/02 (24 hours after No Mercy)|publisher=Wrestleview.com|first=Christopher|last=Ouellette|date=22 October 2002|accessdate=6 February 2011}}</ref> The match was exclusive to the Raw brand for the first four matches and at [[List of WWE pay-per-view events|joint-branded pay-per-view events]], but upon the creation of the [[ECW (WWE brand)|ECW]] brand in 2006 the match was instead promoted for the newly created brand at [[December to Dismember (2006)|December to Dismember]].<ref name=\"wv1\"/> Beginning in 2008, the match became exclusive to the [[WWE No Way Out|No Way Out]] event and two Elimination Chamber matches were featured annually for two years among the three brands.<ref name=\"NWO08\"/><ref name=\"NWO09\"/> In 2010, WWE replaced their No Way Out event with the self-titled [[WWE Elimination Chamber|Elimination Chamber]], a new event which continued the tradition of its predecessor.

He was temporarily engulfed in flames on three occasions when the pyrotechnics were mistimed and his jacket briefly caught on fire. He suffered first and second-degree burns to his neck and chest and according to a WWE spokesperson the injury \"looked like a bad sunburn\". He was only allowed to participate in the match after being cleared by a ringside doctor and was given bottles of water throughout the match to douse himself with to alleviate the discomfort.\n\n== Match ==\n=== Rules ===\nThe Elimination Chamber match is a variation of elimination-based matches which draws elements from steel cage and Hell in a Cell matches in that the [[wrestling ring]] is surrounded by a large steel-fenced cage supported by [[girder]]s. Originally, its design was a circular-like chain-linked structure, but since 2017 it is now square and encloses the ring. Its floor is platformed over the ringside area around the ring which elevates and levels it with the ring mat. Within the Elimination Chamber, four enclosures, referred to as inner chambers or pods, are encased in [[plexiglass]] and face the outside of each ring post.<ref name=\"Description\"/> The match is contested by six or seven participants: two or three starting in the ring, while the other four are held within each inner chamber.<ref name=\"ECMatch\"/> The [[Elimination Chamber (2018)|Elimination Chamber]] in February 2018 featured a seven-man chamber match in which three participants began. Every five minutes, one of the four participants within an inner chamber enters the match. This continues until all four have been released, meaning an Elimination Chamber match typically lasts over twenty or more minutes.<ref name=\"ECMatch\"/> \n\nThe objective of the match is to eliminate each opponent from the match by scoring a [[Pin (professional wrestling)|pinfall]] or a [[Submission (combat sport)|submission]]. These can occur in the ring or on the chamber's elevated floor, but starting with the 2012 event all pinfalls and submissions must take place within the ring. Disqualifications and count-outs do not apply in the process of elimination. The winner of the match is the last remaining participant after all others have been eliminated (or after all members of the opposing tag team are eliminated in either the tag team matches or the twelve-on-twelve tornado tag team elimination matches).<ref name=\"ECMatch\" /> The same rules apply when the match involves six tag teams where two teams start in the ring and a new team leaves the pod enters the ring after every five minutes.<ref name=\"ECMatch\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/specialtymatches/eliminationchamber|title=Specialty Matches: Elimination Chamber|publisher=World Wrestling Entertainment|accessdate=6 February 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080224045708/http://www.wwe.com/inside/specialtymatches/eliminationchamber|archivedate=24 February 2008}}</ref>\n\n=== Structure ===\n[[File:WWE_Elimination_Chamber_2017.jpg|thumb|200px|The current alteration of the Elimination Chamber structure was introduced at the [[Elimination Chamber (2017)|Elimination Chamber]] event in February 2017]]\nAccording to a ''[[WWE Magazine]]'' article in 2009 by WWE's [[production designer]] Jason Robinson, who co-designed the structure, several designs for the Elimination Chamber were considered. The structure was manufactured in [[Colorado Springs, Colorado]] and took six to eight weeks to make from design blueprints. It cost [[United States dollar|US$]] 250,000 to construct.<ref name=\"WWEMag-Design\">{{cite journal|last=Robinson|first=Jason|date=January 2009|title=Cold Steel|journal=[[WWE Magazine]]|pages=pg. 49}}</ref>\n\nThe structure is made of black-painted steel with an outer structure of 16 frames, each weighing {{Convert|300|lb|kg}}.<ref name=\"WWEMag-Design\" /> The chamber is {{convert|16|ft|m|abbr=on}} high and {{Convert|36|ft|m|abbr=on}} in diameter and weighs a total of {{convert|16|ST|kg|abbr=on}}, 10 of which consists of steel.<ref name=\"WWEMag-Design\" /><ref name=\"Almanac\">{{cite news|title=2007 Wrestling Almanac & Book of Facts|work= Wrestling\u2019s Historical Cards|publisher=Kappa Publishing|year=2007|pages=119}}</ref><ref name=\"ECMatch\"/> Each inner chamber consists of three large steel framed sheets of [[Poly(methyl methacrylate)|plexiglass]], costing US$225 per sheet.<ref name=\"WWEMag-Design\"/> The chains that surround the chamber stretch {{Convert|2|mi|km|abbr=on}} long and weigh {{convert|6|ST|kg|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"Almanac\" /><ref name=\"ECMatch\"/>\n\nA {{convert|50|ft|m|abbr=on}} flatbed truck is needed to transport the chamber. Assembly in the arena takes eight hours to complete and eight motors are used to suspend the structure over the ring before each event.<ref name=\"WWEMag-Design\"/> When not in use, the structure is stored at a dock in [[Newark, New Jersey]].<ref name=\"WWEMag-Design\"/> Unlike standard steel cage matches and Hell in a Cell matches, Elimination Chamber matches cannot be held at several arenas due to the structure's massive size and weight, similar to how [[WarGames match]]es could only be held at certain arenas. This would play a factor in WWE dropping the annual Elimination Chamber event.<ref name=Steph>{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestlezone.com/news/543179-stephanie-mcmahon-reveals-the-real-reason-why-wwe-dropped-the-elimination-chamber-ppv|title=Stephanie McMahon Reveals the Real Reason Why WWE Dropped the Elimination Chamber PPV|last=Paglino|first=Nick|date=January 15, 2015|website=Wrestlezone|publisher=Evolve Media|access-date=February 5, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 2017, the Elimination Chamber event returned (2017's event was SmackDown-exclusive while 2018's was Raw-exclusive). In addition, the chamber structure was redesigned, becoming square instead of circular. The pods were also changed from circular to square and feature sliding doors that referees slide open from outside the chamber. At the top of the chamber at its center which is now {{convert|26|ft|m|abbr=on}} tall is a large cutout of the WWE logo. The steel grates between the ring and the cage were also replaced with padding. LED lights also line the corners of the structure. The redesign was for practical purposes due to certain venues only being able to house the previous structure, allowing most venues to host the Chamber.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://heavy.com/news/2017/02/how-the-new-wwe-elimination-chamber-design-compares-compared-to-old-previous-one-photos-dimensions/|title=How the New WWE Elimination Chamber Design Compares to the Old One|date=February 12, 2017|last=Morrow|first=Brendan|work=[[Heavy.com]]|accessdate=February 13, 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Variations ===\nThe fifth match, held by the [[ECW (WWE brand)|ECW]] brand at [[December to Dismember (2006)|December to Dismember]], was a slight variation called the [[Hardcore wrestling|Extreme]] Elimination Chamber.<ref name=\"ECWChamber\">{{cite web|url= http://www.wwe.com/shows/decembertodismember/matches/32934421/results/|accessdate=2 February 2008|title=Mission Accomplished|last=Tello| first=Craig|publisher=World Wrestling Entertainment|date=3 December 2006}}</ref> In this variation, each chamber had one of four [[foreign object (professional wrestling)|weapons]] for the competitors locked inside to hold on to.

Both team members were inside of their respective pods, for a total of six tag teams in the match. This match was for the [[WWE Raw Tag Team Championship|WWE Tag Team Championship]]. This variation was repeated in 2019, but for women and to determine the inaugural holders of the [[WWE Women's Tag Team Championship]].\n\nThe 2018 Elimination Chamber featured the first seven-man chamber match. Due to the extra person, three competitors started the match instead of two. The 2018 event also featured the first women's chamber match, but there were no variations in the rules.\n\n=== Interference ===\nDespite the structure, interference has become common inside the Elimination Chamber. At [[New Year's Revolution (2005)|New Year's Revolution]] in January 2005, [[Ric Flair]] distracted guest referee [[Shawn Michaels]]. allowing [[Dave Bautista|Batista]] who had been eliminated to attack [[Randy Orton]] so [[Triple H]] could win the match. At [[No Way Out (2009)|No Way Out]] in February 2009, [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]] attacked [[Kofi Kingston]] during his entrance and locked himself in one of the pods becoming a participant in the match for the [[World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)|World Heavyweight Championship]] after losing the [[WWE Championship]] earlier in the night. At [[Elimination Chamber (2010)|Elimination Chamber]] in February 2010, [[Cody Rhodes]] passed [[Ted DiBiase Jr.]] a metal pipe which he used to eliminate Randy Orton in the match for the WWE Championship. Later in the night, Shawn Michaels broke into the chamber to cost [[The Undertaker]] his World Heavyweight Championship to [[Chris Jericho]]. At the [[Elimination Chamber (2013)|Elimination Chamber]] event in February 2013, [[Mark Henry]] took out the remaining participants in the chamber for a World Heavyweight Championship match at [[WrestleMania 29]] after being eliminated until [[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown]] General Manager [[Booker T (wrestler)|Booker T]] broke it up. At the [[Elimination Chamber (2014)|Elimination Chamber]] for the [[WWE World Heavyweight Championship]] in February 2014, [[The Wyatt Family]] interfered by attacking [[John Cena]], leading to his eventual elimination  by Randy Orton. [[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]] would then come out to help escort The Wyatt Family out of the chamber, but would then interfere to cost [[Daniel Bryan]] the match to Orton.\n\n=== Match history ===\nThe Elimination Chamber debuted at WWE's event [[Survivor Series (2002)|Survivor Series]] at [[Madison Square Garden]] in November 2002.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wwe.com/shows/eliminationchamber/10-best-elimination-chamber-matches|title=Which brutal Elimination Chamber Match stands above the rest?|website=WWE|language=en|access-date=2020-03-26}}</ref> Since the inaugural match, there have been 25 other matches (26 overall) as of [[Elimination Chamber (2020)|Elimination Chamber]] in March 2020.

[[ECW (WWE brand)|ECW]] has been featured in two matches, including its [[No Way Out (2008)|joint-branded match]] with SmackDown. The SmackDown brand has been featured in eight matches, including the joint-branded matches with both ECW and Raw. The [[WWE Elimination Chamber|Elimination Chamber]] event has featured more Elimination Chamber matches than any other [[List of WWE pay-per-view events|WWE pay-per-view event]], with seventeen matches being held. [[Triple H]] has the most number of victories with four. [[Chris Jericho]] holds the distinctions of being involved in the most number of Elimination Chamber matches to date (8) and eliminating the most wrestlers (10).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wwe.com/shows/eliminationchamber/by-the-numbers|title=Elimination Chamber: by the numbers|website=WWE|language=en|access-date=2020-03-26}}</ref> [[Braun Strowman]] and [[Shayna Baszler]] have the most eliminations in a single Elimination Chamber match (5); Baszler is also the only winner to eliminate all other opponents in a single match.\n\nThe majority of matches have been contested for a top-tier championship with the [[World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)|World Heavyweight Championship]] and [[WWE Championship]] (once as the WWE World Heavyweight Championship) being contested for the most in seven matches each and the [[ECW World Championship]], [[WWE Raw Tag Team Championship|WWE Tag Team Championship]], [[WWE SmackDown Tag Team Championship|SmackDown Tag Team Championship]], [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|Intercontinental Championship]], and [[WWE Raw Women's Championship|Raw Women's Championship]] being contested in one match each. Six matches (two in 2008 and one in 2011, 2013, 2018, and 2020) awarded the winners the number-one contendership for the WWE Championship, World Heavyweight Championship, [[WWE Universal Championship]], and Raw Women's Championship, respectively, at those years' [[WrestleMania]]. The Elimination Chamber match has been contested only in [[indoor arena]]s in the United States and once in Puerto Rico. From 2008 to 2014, the match had been featured in February pay-per-view events only. An Elimination Chamber pay-per-view event took place on May 31, 2015 exclusively on the [[WWE Network]].

Daniel quits his job after a disagreement over a questionable script and returns home to throw a chaotic birthday party for Chris which Miranda objects to. It proves to be the final straw for Miranda, who files for divorce. The court grants sole custody of the children to Miranda; shared custody is contingent on whether Daniel finds a steady job and a suitable residence within three months.\n\nAs Daniel works to rebuild his life, securing himself an apartment and a new job as a janitor at a TV station, he learns that Miranda is seeking a housekeeper. He secretly alters her classified ad form, effectively barring any communication between Miranda and potential candidates for the position. Utilizing his voice acting skills, he calls Miranda while posing as a series of undesirable applicants. He finally calls Miranda as \"Mrs. Euphegenia Doubtfire\", a <!--DO NOT CHANGE THIS WITHOUT DISCUSSION! -->Scottish-accented nanny with strong credentials. Miranda is impressed and invites Mrs. Doubtfire for an interview. Daniel asks his brother Frank, a makeup artist, and Frank's partner, Jack, to create a Mrs. Doubtfire costume, including a prosthetic mask to make him appear as an older woman.\n\nMiranda hires Mrs. Doubtfire after a successful interview. The children initially struggle under Mrs. Doubtfire's authority but soon come around and thrive, and further, Miranda learns to become closer with her children. Daniel learns several household skills as part of the role, further improving himself. However, this creates another barrier for him to see his children, as Miranda has put more trust into Mrs. Doubtfire than him, and she cannot bring herself to dismiss her. One night, Lydia and Chris inadvertently discover that Mrs. Doubtfire is actually Daniel. Thrilled to have their father back, they agree to keep his secret.\n\nWhile working one day, Daniel is seen by the station's CEO Jonathan Lundy playing with toy dinosaurs on the set of a cancelled children's show. Impressed by his voice acting and imagination, Lundy invites Daniel for a dinner to discuss giving him his own children's show to host. Daniel discovers this is to be on the same place and time as a planned birthday dinner for Miranda by her new boyfriend Stuart Dunmeyer, which Mrs. Doubtfire is expected to attend. Unable to change either appointment, Daniel changes in and out of the Mrs. Doubtfire costume to attend both events, consuming several alcoholic drinks in the process. Daniel eventually becomes drunk and slips up when he accidentally returns to Lundy in his costume, but he quickly claims that the character \"Mrs. Doubtfire\" is his idea for the show. After overhearing that Stu is allergic to pepper, Daniel sneaks into the kitchen and seasons Stu's order of [[jambalaya]] with powdered [[cayenne pepper]]. Stu chokes on his dinner, and Daniel, feeling guilty, gives him the [[Heimlich maneuver]] as Mrs. Doubtfire. The action causes the prosthetic mask to partially peel off Daniel's face, revealing his identity and horrifying Miranda who storms out of the restaurant with the kids.\n\nAt their next custody hearing, Daniel points out that he has met the judge's requirements, then explains his actions. The judge, while sympathetic to Daniel, is disturbed by his ruse, and grants Miranda full custody, further restricting Daniel's rights to supervised Saturday visits, which devastates him even more.\n\nWithout Mrs. Doubtfire, Miranda and her children become miserable, acknowledging how much Mrs. Doubtfire improved their lives. They then discover a new children's show called ''Euphegenia's House'' which Daniel, as Mrs. Doubtfire, hosts. The show becomes a hit and starts airing across the country.\n\nMiranda visits Daniel on set, admitting that things were better when he was involved, and agrees to change the custody arrangement. Soon after, she and Daniel share joint custody, allowing him to take the children after school, essentially the same way he had done as Mrs. Doubtfire. As Daniel takes the kids out, Miranda watches an episode of ''Euphegenia's House'' in which Mrs. Doubtfire answers a letter from a young girl whose parents have separated, saying that love makes a family a family, no matter the distance between its members.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Robin Williams]] as Daniel Hillard / Mrs. Euphegenia Doubtfire\n* [[Sally Field]] as Miranda Hillard\n* [[Pierce Brosnan]] as Stuart \"Stu\" Dunmeyer\n* [[Harvey Fierstein]] as Frank Hillard\n* [[Polly Holliday]] as Gloria Cheney\n* [[Lisa Jakub]] as Lydia Hillard\n* [[Matthew Lawrence]] as Chris Hillard\n* [[Mara Wilson]] as Natalie \"Nattie\" Hillard\n* [[Robert Prosky]] as Mr. Jonathan Lundy\n* [[Anne Haney]] as Mrs. Sellner\n* [[Scott Capurro]] as Jack\n* [[Sydney Walker]] as Bus Driver\n* [[Martin Mull]] as Justin Gregory\n* [[Terence McGovern]] as ADR Director Lou \n* [[William Newman (actor)|William Newman]] as Mr. Sprinkles\n* [[Scott Beach]] as Judge\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Mrs doubtfire house san francisco.jpg|thumb|right|The [[San Francisco]] house used for exterior shots of the film, photographed in August 2014, several days after [[Robin Williams]]'s death; a fan-made tribute to Williams can be seen at its front steps.]]\nProduction of the film was in [[San Francisco]].

Daniel quits his job after a disagreement over a questionable script and returns home to throw a chaotic birthday party for Chris which Miranda objects to. It proves to be the final straw for Miranda, who files for divorce. The court grants sole custody of the children to Miranda; shared custody is contingent on whether Daniel finds a steady job and a suitable residence within three months.\n\nAs Daniel works to rebuild his life, securing himself an apartment and a new job as a janitor at a TV station, he learns that Miranda is seeking a housekeeper. He secretly alters her classified ad form, effectively barring any communication between Miranda and potential candidates for the position. Utilizing his voice acting skills, he calls Miranda while posing as a series of undesirable applicants. He finally calls Miranda as \"Mrs. Euphegenia Doubtfire\", a <!--DO NOT CHANGE THIS WITHOUT DISCUSSION! -->Scottish-accented nanny with strong credentials. Miranda is impressed and invites Mrs. Doubtfire for an interview. Daniel asks his brother Frank, a makeup artist, and Frank's partner, Jack, to create a Mrs. Doubtfire costume, including a prosthetic mask to make him appear as an older woman.\n\nMiranda hires Mrs. Doubtfire after a successful interview. The children initially struggle under Mrs. Doubtfire's authority but soon come around and thrive, and further, Miranda learns to become closer with her children. Daniel learns several household skills as part of the role, further improving himself. However, this creates another barrier for him to see his children, as Miranda has put more trust into Mrs. Doubtfire than him, and she cannot bring herself to dismiss her. One night, Lydia and Chris inadvertently discover that Mrs. Doubtfire is actually Daniel. Thrilled to have their father back, they agree to keep his secret.\n\nWhile working one day, Daniel is seen by the station's CEO Jonathan Lundy playing with toy dinosaurs on the set of a cancelled children's show. Impressed by his voice acting and imagination, Lundy invites Daniel for a dinner to discuss giving him his own children's show to host. Daniel discovers this is to be on the same place and time as a planned birthday dinner for Miranda by her new boyfriend Stuart Dunmeyer, which Mrs. Doubtfire is expected to attend. Unable to change either appointment, Daniel changes in and out of the Mrs. Doubtfire costume to attend both events, consuming several alcoholic drinks in the process. Daniel eventually becomes drunk and slips up when he accidentally returns to Lundy in his costume, but he quickly claims that the character \"Mrs. Doubtfire\" is his idea for the show. After overhearing that Stu is allergic to pepper, Daniel sneaks into the kitchen and seasons Stu's order of [[jambalaya]] with powdered [[cayenne pepper]]. Stu chokes on his dinner, and Daniel, feeling guilty, gives him the [[Heimlich maneuver]] as Mrs. Doubtfire. The action causes the prosthetic mask to partially peel off Daniel's face, revealing his identity and horrifying Miranda who storms out of the restaurant with the kids.\n\nAt their next custody hearing, Daniel points out that he has met the judge's requirements, then explains his actions. The judge, while sympathetic to Daniel, is disturbed by his ruse, and grants Miranda full custody, further restricting Daniel's rights to supervised Saturday visits, which devastates him even more.\n\nWithout Mrs. Doubtfire, Miranda and her children become miserable, acknowledging how much Mrs. Doubtfire improved their lives. They then discover a new children's show called ''Euphegenia's House'' which Daniel, as Mrs. Doubtfire, hosts. The show becomes a hit and starts airing across the country.\n\nMiranda visits Daniel on set, admitting that things were better when he was involved, and agrees to change the custody arrangement. Soon after, she and Daniel share joint custody, allowing him to take the children after school, essentially the same way he had done as Mrs. Doubtfire. As Daniel takes the kids out, Miranda watches an episode of ''Euphegenia's House'' in which Mrs. Doubtfire answers a letter from a young girl whose parents have separated, saying that love makes a family a family, no matter the distance between its members.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Robin Williams]] as Daniel Hillard / Mrs. Euphegenia Doubtfire\n* [[Sally Field]] as Miranda Hillard\n* [[Pierce Brosnan]] as Stuart \"Stu\" Dunmeyer\n* [[Harvey Fierstein]] as Frank Hillard\n* [[Polly Holliday]] as Gloria Cheney\n* [[Lisa Jakub]] as Lydia Hillard\n* [[Matthew Lawrence]] as Chris Hillard\n* [[Mara Wilson]] as Natalie \"Nattie\" Hillard\n* [[Robert Prosky]] as Mr. Jonathan Lundy\n* [[Anne Haney]] as Mrs. Sellner\n* [[Scott Capurro]] as Jack\n* [[Sydney Walker]] as Bus Driver\n* [[Martin Mull]] as Justin Gregory\n* [[Terence McGovern]] as ADR Director Lou \n* [[William Newman (actor)|William Newman]] as Mr. Sprinkles\n* [[Scott Beach]] as Judge\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Mrs doubtfire house san francisco.jpg|thumb|right|The [[San Francisco]] house used for exterior shots of the film, photographed in August 2014, several days after [[Robin Williams]]'s death; a fan-made tribute to Williams can be seen at its front steps.]]\nProduction of the film was in [[San Francisco]].
