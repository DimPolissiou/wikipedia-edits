Bach]].\n\nRifkin has done extensive research on the [[Orchestral suites (Bach)|orchestral suites]] of Bach, in particular arguing in detail that No. 2 in B minor, BWV 1067, is based on an earlier version in A minor in which the solo instrument was not the flute.<ref>Joshua Rifkin, \"The B-Minor Flute Suite Deconstructed\" in Gregory Butler (ed.), Bach Perspectives, nr 6: J.

Bach's posited Oboe Concerti: for oboe, strings and continuo in D minor, from [[BWV 35]], [[BWV 156|156]], [[BWV 1056|1056]] and [[BWV 1059|1059]]; in A major for oboe d'amore, strings and continuo from [[BWV 1055]]; in E-flat major for oboe, strings and continuo from [[BWV 49]], [[BWV 169|169]] and [[BWV 1053|1053]]. All the original movements are keyboard settings. They reflect the Baroque oboe idiom convincingly. In this form, they evince the influence of the Venetian school, notably [[Marcello]], [[Arcangelo Corelli|Corelli]] and [[Vivaldi]].<ref>Technical notes in the CD cover of Rifkin's own recording: Pro Arte digital CDD 153.</ref>\n\nIn a paper published in the ''[[Bach-Jahrbuch]]'' in 2000, Rifkin argued that the cantata ''[[Nun ist das Heil und die Kraft, BWV 50]]'' was not written by Bach, but by an as-yet unidentified composer.<ref>Rifkin, Joshua (2000). \"Siegesjubel und Satzfehler. Zum Problem von \"Nun ist das Heil und die Kraft\" (BWV 50)\". Bach-Jahrbuch 86: 67\u201386</ref>\n\n==Studies and career==\nRifkin studied with [[Vincent Persichetti]] in the Music Division at the [[The Juilliard School|Juilliard School]] and received his Bachelor of Science degree in 1964. He also studied with [[Gustave Reese]] at [[New York University]] (1964\u20131966), at the [[University of G\u00f6ttingen]] (1966\u20131967), and later with [[Arthur Mendel]], [[Lewis Lockwood]], [[Milton Babbitt]], and [[Ernst Oster]] at [[Princeton University]] where he received his M.F.A. in 1969. He also worked with [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]] at [[Darmstadt]] in 1961 and 1965.\n\nRifkin has taught at several universities, including [[Brandeis University]] (1970\u20131982), [[Harvard]], [[Yale]], and is currently Professor of Music and Fellow of the University Professors at [[Boston University]]. He is noted for his research in the field of Renaissance and Baroque music: scholarship by Rifkin has examined the authorship and chronology of music attributed to [[Josquin des Prez]]; Renaissance music manuscripts; the [[motet]] around 1500; and music of [[Heinrich Sch\u00fctz]]. He has also published research about [[Anton Webern]].\n\nAs a conductor and keyboard soloist, he has appeared with the [[English Chamber Orchestra]], [[San Francisco Symphony]], [[St. Louis Symphony]], [[Scottish Chamber Orchestra]], [[Victorian State Symphony]], and Israel Camerata Jerusalem. He has led operatic productions at [[Theater Basel]] in Switzerland and the [[Bayerische Staatsoper]], Munich. He has recorded music of Handel, Mozart, and Haydn with the [[Concertgebouw]] Chamber Orchestra and [[Capella Coloniensis]]. As a choral conductor he has recorded motets of [[Adrian Willaert]] with the Boston Camerata Chamber Singers, and music of the [[Medici Codex]] with the Dutch ensemble [[Capella Pratensis]]; that 2011 CD, titled ''Vivat Leo! Music for a Medici Pope'', won a [[Diapason d'Or]].<ref>''Vivat Leo! Music for a Medici Pope'' SACD Rifkin (Challenge) 2011</ref> Among his works as a composer are the two ''Winter pieces'' for violin resp. piano both written in 1961. The ''Winter piece for violin'' was premiered by [[Paul Zukofsky]] in 1962.<ref>https://www.tobias-broeker.de/rare-manuscripts/m-r/rifkin-joshua/</ref>\n\n==Work in non-classical music==\nIn the 1960s, Rifkin created arrangements for [[Judy Collins]] on her albums ''In My Life'' and ''Wildflowers''. He performed with the [[Even Dozen Jug Band]] (along with [[David Grisman]], [[Maria Muldaur]], [[Stefan Grossman]], and [[John Sebastian]], among others) and made a recording of his humorous re-imaginings of music by Lennon and McCartney in the style of the 18th century, notably Bach, known as ''[[The Baroque Beatles Book]]'' and recently reissued on CD. In a related vein, Rifkin sang the countertenor solo in the premiere performance of the spoof cantata ''[[Iphigenia in Brooklyn]]'' by [[P. D. Q. Bach]] ([[Peter Schickele]]).\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{Cite book| last = Rifkin | first = Joshua | title = Bach's Choral Ideal | series = Dortmunder Bach-Forschungen 5 | publisher = Klangfarben Musikverlag | location = Dortmund | year = 2002 | isbn = 978-3-932676-10-9}}\n* {{Cite journal| last = Rifkin | first = Joshua |date=November 1982 | title = Bach's Chorus: A Preliminary Report | journal = The Musical Times | volume = 123 | pages = 747\u201354 | doi = 10.2307/961592 | jstor = 961592 | issue = 1677 | publisher = Musical Times Publications Ltd. }}\n* {{Cite journal| last = Rifkin | first = Joshua |date=July 1975 | title = The Chronology of Bach's Saint Matthew Passion | journal = The Musical Quarterly | volume = 61| issue = 3 | pages = 360\u201387 | doi = 10.1093/mq/LXI.3.360 }}\n* {{Cite journal| last = Rifkin | first = Joshua | year = 2000 | title = Siegesjubel und Satzfehler.

In this form, they evince the influence of the Venetian school, notably [[Marcello]], [[Arcangelo Corelli|Corelli]] and [[Vivaldi]].<ref>Technical notes in the CD cover of Rifkin's own recording: Pro Arte digital CDD 153.</ref>\n\nIn a paper published in the ''[[Bach-Jahrbuch]]'' in 2000, Rifkin argued that the cantata ''[[Nun ist das Heil und die Kraft, BWV 50]]'' was not written by Bach, but by an as-yet unidentified composer.<ref>Rifkin, Joshua (2000). \"Siegesjubel und Satzfehler. Zum Problem von \"Nun ist das Heil und die Kraft\" (BWV 50)\". Bach-Jahrbuch 86: 67\u201386</ref>\n\n==Studies and career==\nRifkin studied with [[Vincent Persichetti]] in the Music Division at the [[The Juilliard School|Juilliard School]] and received his Bachelor of Science degree in 1964. He also studied with [[Gustave Reese]] at [[New York University]] (1964\u20131966), at the [[University of G\u00f6ttingen]] (1966\u20131967), and later with [[Arthur Mendel]], [[Lewis Lockwood]], [[Milton Babbitt]], and [[Ernst Oster]] at [[Princeton University]] where he received his M.F.A. in 1969. He also worked with [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]] at [[Darmstadt]] in 1961 and 1965.\n\nRifkin has taught at several universities, including [[Brandeis University]] (1970\u20131982), [[Harvard]], [[Yale]], and is currently Professor of Music and Fellow of the University Professors at [[Boston University]]. He is noted for his research in the field of Renaissance and Baroque music: scholarship by Rifkin has examined the authorship and chronology of music attributed to [[Josquin des Prez]]; Renaissance music manuscripts; the [[motet]] around 1500; and music of [[Heinrich Sch\u00fctz]]. He has also published research about [[Anton Webern]].\n\nAs a conductor and keyboard soloist, he has appeared with the [[English Chamber Orchestra]], [[San Francisco Symphony]], [[St. Louis Symphony]], [[Scottish Chamber Orchestra]], [[Victorian State Symphony]], and Israel Camerata Jerusalem. He has led operatic productions at [[Theater Basel]] in Switzerland and the [[Bayerische Staatsoper]], Munich. He has recorded music of Handel, Mozart, and Haydn with the [[Concertgebouw]] Chamber Orchestra and [[Capella Coloniensis]]. As a choral conductor he has recorded motets of [[Adrian Willaert]] with the Boston Camerata Chamber Singers, and music of the [[Medici Codex]] with the Dutch ensemble [[Capella Pratensis]]; that 2011 CD, titled ''Vivat Leo! Music for a Medici Pope'', won a [[Diapason d'Or]].<ref>''Vivat Leo! Music for a Medici Pope'' SACD Rifkin (Challenge) 2011</ref> Among his works as a composer are the two ''Winter pieces'' for violin resp. piano both written in 1961. The ''Winter piece for violin'' was premiered by [[Paul Zukofsky]] in 1962.<ref>https://www.tobias-broeker.de/rare-manuscripts/m-r/rifkin-joshua/</ref>\n\n==Work in non-classical music==\nIn the 1960s, Rifkin created arrangements for [[Judy Collins]] on her albums ''In My Life'' and ''Wildflowers''. He performed with the [[Even Dozen Jug Band]] (along with [[David Grisman]], [[Maria Muldaur]], [[Stefan Grossman]], and [[John Sebastian]], among others) and made a recording of his humorous re-imaginings of music by Lennon and McCartney in the style of the 18th century, notably Bach, known as ''[[The Baroque Beatles Book]]'' and recently reissued on CD. In a related vein, Rifkin sang the countertenor solo in the premiere performance of the spoof cantata ''[[Iphigenia in Brooklyn]]'' by [[P. D. Q. Bach]] ([[Peter Schickele]]).\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{Cite book| last = Rifkin | first = Joshua | title = Bach's Choral Ideal | series = Dortmunder Bach-Forschungen 5 | publisher = Klangfarben Musikverlag | location = Dortmund | year = 2002 | isbn = 978-3-932676-10-9}}\n* {{Cite journal| last = Rifkin | first = Joshua |date=November 1982 | title = Bach's Chorus: A Preliminary Report | journal = The Musical Times | volume = 123 | pages = 747\u201354 | doi = 10.2307/961592 | jstor = 961592 | issue = 1677 | publisher = Musical Times Publications Ltd. }}\n* {{Cite journal| last = Rifkin | first = Joshua |date=July 1975 | title = The Chronology of Bach's Saint Matthew Passion | journal = The Musical Quarterly | volume = 61| issue = 3 | pages = 360\u201387 | doi = 10.1093/mq/LXI.3.360 }}\n* {{Cite journal| last = Rifkin | first = Joshua | year = 2000 | title = Siegesjubel und Satzfehler.

His obituary states his age to be 69 in December 1954, which would then indicate the birth year as 1885. The draft card of 1942 reveals his birth place to be Dzia\u0142y\u0144, but it is unclear, which of the 4 places of this name in Poland it could have been. \n\nAccording to Fairfield's book, William built his first violin already at age 9 (in 1895), which would indicate that he came from a luthier or a musical family. In 1903, by the age of 17, he was a trained violin maker.<ref name=\"Fairfield\"></ref> \n\nAs many Poles of the time would leave the poverty and the Russian and German nationalist oppression of partitioned Poland, he joined his family in the [[United States]]. The year [[1904]], when he would be 17-18 years old, is listed as the year of his immigration in the 1920 New York census, where his name is misspelled William Wikanoski and mistranscribed as Wikanski.<ref name=\"1920census\">1920 US New York Census, Brooklyn</ref>\n<br>As countless Poles would do to assimilate in the United States, he changed his Polish first name Wladyslaw<ref name=\"marriage\"></ref><ref name=\"heritage\"></ref> to the English name with the same initial, William, which would not be given as a child name in Poland, unless as the German form Wilhelm in the German speaking partitions of Poland. In the New York census records, there are several people listed with the last name Wilkanowski. At least one male relative of Wilkanowski already resided in New York - the father of his cousin Maximilian, born in New York. In [[1905]], William and his wife Amelia had their daughter Helen; several children followed, listed as 7 children, all born in New York and speaking Polish and English, as listed in the census of 1920.<ref name=\"1920census\"></ref>\n\nInitially, William worked in the shop of Oliver Ditson of Boston. In the 1930s, he worked for Fred [[Gretsch]] ([[New York City]]), out of his own workshop and store in 58 Nassau Street, Brooklyn, New York. William was also a violinist himself and was a member of a polka band in the 1920s.<ref name=\"Cozio Archive\"></ref>\n\n==Career in the United States==\nHe was listed as a violin maker in [[Brooklyn]] by 1933, and at least one violin made in Brooklyn dates to 1924. From 1937 to 1941, he worked in both an era and a location renowned for the [[jazz guitar]]. Gretsch offered Wilkanowski's violins in a 1940 flyer with the text \"his own personal work\u2026no other hand touches them.\" His violins were offered from $50\u2013150.\n\nWilkanowski is thought to have produced 5,000 violins and 100 [[viola]]s by 1942. <ref name=\"Fairfield\"></ref> Some of the higher quality violins were marked with an inlayed logo of the stylized letter ''W''; these instruments are thought to be entirely of his own making, while many of the others were made in the shops with assistants. The Gretsch Company released the Synchromatic line during the early '40s also, which were also [[archtop guitar]]s, but shared no other similarities with Wilkanowski guitars. His role in the Synchromatic is not known.\n\nAlthough known for his violins, Wilkanowski also produced a limited number of archtop guitars. The guitars were never catalogued. By 1942 he had sold 30 of these instruments, each unique in appointments and features, at $400 each, except for two deluxe Airway guitars, sold for $600. This price was in line with what was being charged for a D\u2019Angelico New Yorker, or a [[Gibson Guitar Corporation]] Super 400. There is no evidence of guitars made by Wilkanowski after 1943, instead he continued making and successfully selling violins until 1952.\n\n== Features of his guitars ==\nMost of the Wilkanowski guitars would look not like regular jazz guitars, but very much like oversized and slightly squished violins or small cellos with an added guitar neck. Some of his guitars did not have the cello shape, but rather a more conventional archtop shape, without the cello-like points above the waist. The Wilkanowski headstock is thought to have been the main influence in the headstock for the current [[Ovation Guitar]]. Many of his guitars have the unique flattened oval Wilkanowski headstock, although some featured a violin like scroll of aluminium, and some of his headstocks would just be like conventional guitar headstock. The backs of most of his guitars were one piece of flamed [[maple]], with no center joint. The wood William used would often be the Po Valley Poplar, a figured cello tonewood that can resemble maple. The finishing techniques included very light stain, or a violin color finish, and light sealer. The multiple layer binding was wooden, something fairly innovative at the time, and was raised above the level of the top and back plates. The f holes varied by instrument, standard shape, segmented, and later more modern cutouts appeared.  Some of the Instruments displayed the name AIRWAY, some had a W on the headstock, and some remained unbranded. Some of the guitars carry serial numbers, a signature, or a label. Several of the guitars are labeled Wilkanowski and Son, although nothing is known of the son's responsibility. One of these guitars, the Airway W-4 model with abalone shell inlayed rim around the entire body front and abalone ornaments on the neck, was given as a gift to Johnny Cash by his wife June in the 1980s. Johnny kept this guitar until his death, and the instrument was subsequently sold at the [[Johnny Cash]] estate auction by [[Sotheby's]] in 2004,<ref name=\"Cash\"></ref> for 30,000 dollars,<ref name=\"Cozio Archive\"></ref> to appear again on auctions later.\n\n== Personal life, family and death ==\nWilliam married a fellow Polish immigrant, Michalina Amelia, who came to New York in 1901. Their marriage was registered to the year 1911,<ref name=\"marriage\"></ref> but the couple already started having children earlier. His wife would go by the name Amelia, registered as Emily or as Emilia (1930 Census). Her maiden name was also listed and misspelled as Glowinska<ref name=\"heritage\"></ref>, Growdanska<ref name=\"marriageNatalie\">Pennsylvania, County Marriages, 1885-1950, marriage of Natalie W. Orth in 1944</ref> or Grobinska.<ref name=\"Reges\">New York City Municipal Deaths, 1795-1949 for Rege, Isabella</ref> in New York. Together they had 11 children in total, of whom 9 would survive them - the 7 daughters Genowefa/Genevieve (1907-1977), Carolyne, Helen, Florence, Irene, Viola and Natalie (1924-2009), and the 2 sons Henry (1922-1965)<ref name=\"graveHenry\"></ref> and Theodore Joseph (1919-1969).<ref name=\"graveTheodore\"></ref> In the 1940 New York census, Amelia is listed as Emily and 53 years old, 1 year older than William listed as \"Wm\", 52 years old. Five of their youngest children - the 3 girls and 2 sons - are listed living with the parents in the same 1940 census, which indicates their 5 oldest daughters already moved out and married.<ref name=\"1940census\">1940 US Census, New York, Brooklyn</ref> The name Joseph seems to have been significant to Wilkanowski, who would also label some of his violins with the name \"Juzek\", which is the slightly misspelled Polish diminutive of Joseph. \n\nIn the 1940s, both of Wilkanowski's sons were drafted for the World War II, and William himself was also registered. \nHenry was drafted in 1942 and sent to fight in Germany with his infantry battalion, which earned him a military grave at the Long Island National cemetery,<ref name=\"graveHenry\">[https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/82604147/henry-wilkanowski] Grave of Henry Wilkanowski</ref>. Theodore was drafted in 1940 in the Young Man Draft and he listed his father as contact and his employer as Wilkanowski + Son (which was the label on the archtop guitars).<ref name=\"TheodoreDraft\">U.S. WWII Draft Cards Young Men, 1940-1947</ref> Theodore later became a corporal in WWII.<ref name=\"graveTheodore\">\n[https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/29543508/theodore-j-wilkanowski] Grave of Theodore J. Wilkanowski</ref> <br>\nThe registration card from April 1942 has a small but detailed description of William, providing the date and place of his birth, misspelled as the non-existing place \"Dziatyn\" (as the Polish small letter [[\u0142]] looks very much like the Latin [[t]]), his age as 56 which was then crossed over and corrected to the factual 55, having the birthday in November, his height as 5'4, his weight as 155 pounds, his eye color as brown, hair as gray and complexion as ruddy. In the occupation field, William did not disclose himself as a luthier, but as self employed. On this card, he also listed an Edward Wilkanowski of Russau Street in Brooklyn as a contact, possibly a relative.<ref name=\"draft1942\"></ref><br>\n\nThe obituary in The Brooklyn Eagle of Saturday, December 11, 1954 describes in detail the death of William as suicide by hanging and that his body was found Wednesday the 8th of December in his home by Henry, who stopped by to pick his father up for a family dinner. William was interred on Monday December 13, 1954 in the Cemetery of the Holy Rood in Westbury, Nassau County NY, next to his wife.<ref name=\"obituary\"></ref>\n\nAfter his death, a number of unfinished and dusty violins were found in his home. It seems as some of them were then finished by his coworkers or family members, as some Wilkanowski violins have labels dated later than 1952.<ref name=\"Cozio Archive\"></ref>\n\n== Litterature ==\n* Bacon, Tony.

In 1903, by the age of 17, he was a trained violin maker.<ref name=\"Fairfield\"></ref> \n\nAs many Poles of the time would leave the poverty and the Russian and German nationalist oppression of partitioned Poland, he joined his family in the [[United States]]. The year [[1904]], when he would be 17-18 years old, is listed as the year of his immigration in the 1920 New York census, where his name is misspelled William Wikanoski and mistranscribed as Wikanski.<ref name=\"1920census\">1920 US New York Census, Brooklyn</ref>\n<br>As many Poles would do to assimilate in the United States, it seems he changed his Polish first name to a somewhat similar English name with the same initial, William, which would not be given as a child name in Poland, unless as the German form Wilhelm, known in the German speaking partitions of Poland. One source lists his Polish first name as Wladyslaw.<ref name=\"heritage\"></ref> In the New York census records, there are several people listed with the last name Wilkanowski. At least one male relative of Wilkanowski already resided in New York - the father of his cousin Maximilian, born in New York. In [[1905]], William and his wife Amelia had their daughter Helen; several children followed, listed as 7 children, all born in New York and speaking Polish and English, as listed in the census of 1920.<ref name=\"1920census\"></ref>\n\nInitially, William worked in the shop of Oliver Ditson of Boston. In the 1930s, he worked for Fred [[Gretsch]] ([[New York City]]), out of his own workshop and store in 58 Nassau Street, Brooklyn, New York. William was also a violinist himself and was a member of a polka band in the 1920s.<ref name=\"Cozio Archive\"></ref>\n\n==Career in the United States==\nHe was listed as a violin maker in [[Brooklyn]] by 1933, and at least one violin made in Brooklyn dates to 1924. From 1937 to 1941, he worked in both an era and a location renowned for the [[jazz guitar]]. Gretsch offered Wilkanowski's violins in a 1940 flyer with the text \"his own personal work\u2026no other hand touches them.\" His violins were offered from $50\u2013150.\n\nWilkanowski is thought to have produced 5,000 violins and 100 [[viola]]s by 1942. <ref name=\"Fairfield\"></ref> Some of the higher quality violins were marked with an inlayed logo of the stylized letter ''W''; these instruments are thought to be entirely of his own making, while many of the others were made in the shops with assistants. The Gretsch Company released the Synchromatic line during the early '40s also, which were also [[archtop guitar]]s, but shared no other similarities with Wilkanowski guitars. His role in the Synchromatic is not known.\n\nAlthough known for his violins, Wilkanowski also produced a limited number of archtop guitars. The guitars were never catalogued. By 1942 he had sold 30 of these instruments, each unique in appointments and features, at $400 each, except for two deluxe Airway guitars, sold for $600. This price was in line with what was being charged for a D\u2019Angelico New Yorker, or a [[Gibson Guitar Corporation]] Super 400. There is no evidence of guitars made by Wilkanowski after 1943, instead he continued making and successfully selling violins until 1952.\n\n== Features of his guitars ==\nMost of the Wilkanowski guitars would look not like regular jazz guitars, but very much like oversized and slightly squished violins or small cellos with an added guitar neck. Some of his guitars did not have the cello shape, but rather a more conventional archtop shape, without the cello-like points above the waist. The Wilkanowski headstock is thought to have been the main influence in the headstock for the current [[Ovation Guitar]]. Many of his guitars have the unique flattened oval Wilkanowski headstock, although some featured a violin like scroll of aluminium, and some of his headstocks would just be like conventional guitar headstock. The backs of most of his guitars were one piece of flamed [[maple]], with no center joint. The wood William used would often be the Po Valley Poplar, a figured cello tonewood that can resemble maple. The finishing techniques included very light stain, or a violin color finish, and light sealer. The multiple layer binding was wooden, something fairly innovative at the time, and was raised above the level of the top and back plates. The f holes varied by instrument, standard shape, segmented, and later more modern cutouts appeared.  Some of the Instruments displayed the name AIRWAY, some had a W on the headstock, and some remained unbranded. Some of the guitars carry serial numbers, a signature, or a label. Several of the guitars are labeled Wilkanowski and Son, although nothing is known of the son's responsibility. One of these guitars, the Airway W-4 model with abalone shell inlayed rim around the entire body front and abalone ornaments on the neck, was given as a gift to Johnny Cash by his wife June in the 1980s. Johnny kept this guitar until his death, and the instrument was subsequently sold at the [[Johnny Cash]] estate auction by [[Sotheby's]] in 2004,<ref name=\"Cash\"></ref> for 30,000 dollars,<ref name=\"Cozio Archive\"></ref> to appear again on auctions later.\n\n== Personal life, family and death ==\nWilliam married a fellow Polish immigrant, Michalina Amelia, who came to New York in 1901. Their marriage was registered to the year 1911,<ref name=\"marriage\"></ref> but the couple already started having children earlier. His wife would go by the name Amelia, registered as Emily or as Emilia (1930 Census). Her maiden name was also listed and misspelled as Glowinska<ref name=\"heritage\"></ref>, Growdanska<ref name=\"marriageNatalie\">Pennsylvania, County Marriages, 1885-1950, marriage of Natalie W. Orth in 1944</ref> or Grobinska.<ref name=\"Reges\">New York City Municipal Deaths, 1795-1949 for Rege, Isabella</ref> in New York. Together they had 11 children in total, of whom 9 would survive them - the 7 daughters Genowefa/Genevieve (1907-1977), Carolyne, Helen, Florence, Irene, Viola and Natalie (1924-2009), and the 2 sons Henry (1922-1965)<ref name=\"graveHenry\"></ref> and Theodore Joseph (1919-1969).<ref name=\"graveTheodore\"></ref> In the 1940 New York census, Amelia is listed as Emily and 53 years old, 1 year older than William listed as \"Wm\", 52 years old. Five of their youngest children - the 3 girls and 2 sons - are listed living with the parents in the same 1940 census, which indicates their 5 oldest daughters already moved out and married.<ref name=\"1940census\">1940 US Census, New York, Brooklyn</ref> The name Joseph seems to have been significant to Wilkanowski, who would also label some of his violins with the name \"Juzek\", which is the slightly misspelled Polish diminutive of Joseph. \n\nIn the 1940s, both of Wilkanowski's sons were drafted for the World War II, and William himself was also registered. \nHenry was drafted in 1942 and sent to fight in Germany with his infantry battalion, which earned him a military grave at the Long Island National cemetery,<ref name=\"graveHenry\">[https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/82604147/henry-wilkanowski] Grave of Henry Wilkanowski</ref>. Theodore was drafted in 1940 in the Young Man Draft and he listed his father as contact and his employer as Wilkanowski + Son (which was the label on the archtop guitars).<ref name=\"TheodoreDraft\">U.S. WWII Draft Cards Young Men, 1940-1947</ref> Theodore later became a corporal in WWII.<ref name=\"graveTheodore\">\n[https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/29543508/theodore-j-wilkanowski] Grave of Theodore J. Wilkanowski</ref> <br>\nThe registration card from April 1942 has a small but detailed description of William, providing the date and place of his birth, misspelled as the non-existing place \"Dziatyn\" (as the Polish small letter [[\u0142]] looks very much like the Latin [[t]]), his age as 56 which was then crossed over and corrected to the factual 55, having the birthday in November, his height as 5'4, his weight as 155 pounds, his eye color as brown, hair as gray and complexion as ruddy. In the occupation field, William did not disclose himself as a luthier, but as self employed. On this card, he also listed an Edward Wilkanowski of Russau Street in Brooklyn as a contact, possibly a relative.<ref name=\"draft1942\"></ref><br>\n\nThe obituary in The Brooklyn Eagle of Saturday, December 11, 1954 describes in detail the death of William as suicide by hanging and that his body was found Wednesday the 8th of December in his home by Henry, who stopped by to pick his father up for a family dinner. William was interred on Monday December 13, 1954 in the Cemetery of the Holy Rood in Westbury, Nassau County NY, next to his wife.<ref name=\"obituary\"></ref>\n\nAfter his death, a number of unfinished and dusty violins were found in his home. It seems as some of them were then finished by his coworkers or family members, as some Wilkanowski violins have labels dated later than 1952.<ref name=\"Cozio Archive\"></ref>\n\n== Litterature ==\n* Bacon, Tony.

The department is one of the most premier institutions for the study of [[economics]]. It offers undergraduate A.B. degrees as well as graduate Ph.D. degrees.  It is considered one of the \"big five\" schools in the field along with the faculties at the [[University of Chicago]], [[Harvard University]], [[Stanford University]], and [[MIT Department of Economics|MIT]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Roessler |first1=Christian |title=Applying for Admission to Economics PhD Programs in the United States |url=https://www.scribd.com/document/68515089/Guide-to-PhD-s-in-Economics |website=University of Rochester}}</ref> According to the 2018 ''[[U.S. News & World Report]]'', the department ranks as No. 1 in the field of economics.<ref>{{cite web |title=Economics |url=https://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-humanities-schools/economics-rankings |website=U.S. News and World Report}}</ref> \n\nThe department is located in the Julis Romo Rabinowitz Building & Louis A.

Coursework specifically in political economy became available in 1819. When [[Woodrow Wilson]] became a professor in 1890, additional courses were added to the curriculum, including the History of Political Economy. By 1913, the department became independent from history and politics, forming the Department of Economics and Social Institutions.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Leitch |first1=Alexander |title=The Department of Economics |url=http://etcweb.princeton.edu/CampusWWW/Companion/economics_department.html |website=A Princeton Companion}}</ref>\n\n==Academics==\n\nThe [[undergraduate]] program is one of the most prestigious programs for the study of economics in the country and in the world.
