His father was Colonial Undersecretary of State and a noted [[abolitionist]]. He was the fourth of five children, his siblings including [[James Fitzjames Stephen]] (1829\u20131894) and [[Caroline Emelia Stephen]] (1834\u20131909).\n\nHis family had belonged to the [[Clapham Sect]], the early 19th century group of mainly [[evangelicalism|evangelical]] Christian [[social reform]]ers. At his father's house he saw a good deal of the [[Zachary Macaulay|Macaulays]], [[James Spedding]], Sir [[Henry Taylor (dramatist)|Henry Taylor]] and [[Nassau William Senior|Nassau Senior]]. Leslie Stephen was educated at [[Eton College]], [[King's College London]] and [[Trinity Hall, Cambridge]], where he graduated B.A. (20th [[Wrangler (University of Cambridge)|wrangler]]) in 1854 and M.A. in 1857. He was elected a [[fellow]] of Trinity Hall in 1854 and became a junior tutor in 1856.{{sfn|ACAD|STFN850L}} In 1859 he was [[ordained]] but his study of philosophy, together with the religious controversies surrounding the publication of [[The Origin of Species]] (1859) by [[Charles Darwin]], caused him to lose his faith in 1862, and in 1864 he resigned from his positions at Cambridge, and moved to London. He recounted some of his experiences in a chapter in his ''Life of Fawcett'' as well as in some less formal ''Sketches from Cambridge: By a Don'' (1865). These sketches were reprinted from the ''[[Pall Mall Gazette]]'', to the proprietor of which, [[George Murray Smith]], he had been introduced by his brother.{{sfn|Luebering|2006}}\n\n=== Marriage ===\n\n==== (1) Harriet (Minny) Thackeray 1867\u20131875====\n[[File:Harriet and Leslie Stephen 1867.jpg|thumb|Harriet and Leslie Stephen, 1867]]\n[[File:Harriet Marian Thackeray Stephen, Kensal Green Cemetery.JPG|thumb|Harriet's grave, Kensal Green Cemetery]]\nThe family connections included that of [[William Makepeace Thackeray]]. His brother, Fitzjames had been a friend of Thackeray's and assisted in the disposition of his estate when he died in 1863. His sister Caroline met Thackeray's daughters, [[Anne Isabella Thackeray|Anny]] (1837\u20131919) and Minny (Harriet Marian Thackeray 1840\u20131875) when they were mutual guests of [[Julia Margaret Cameron]] (of whom, see later). This led to an invitation to visit from Leslie Stephen's mother, Lady Stephen, where the sisters met him. They also met at George Murray Smith's house at Hampstead. Minny and Leslie became engaged on 4 December 1866 and married on 19 June 1867. After the wedding they travelled to the Swiss Alps and northern Italy, and on return to England lived at the Thackeray sister's home at 16 Onslow Gardens with Anny, who was a novelist. In the spring of 1868 Minny [[miscarried]] but recovered sufficiently for the couple to tour the eastern United States. Minny miscarried again in 1869, but became pregnant again in 1870 and on 7 December gave birth to their daughter, Laura Makepeace Stephen (1870\u20131945). Laura was premature, weighing three pounds. In March 1873 Thackeray and the Stephens moved to 8 Southwell Gardens. The couple travelled extensively, and by 1875 Minny was pregnant again, but this time was in poor health. On 27 November she developed convulsions, and died the following day of [[eclampsia]].{{sfn|Bicknell|1996}}\n\nAfter Minny's death, Leslie Stephen continued to live with Anny, but they moved to 11 Hyde Park gate South in 1876, next door to her widowed friend and collaborator, Julia Duckworth. Leslie Stephen and his daughter were also cared for by his sister, the writer [[Caroline Emelia Stephen]], although Leslie described her as \"Silly Milly\" and her books as \"little works\".<ref name=lewis>{{cite journal|last1=Lewis|first1=Alison M|title=Caroline Stephen and her niece, Virginia Woolf|journal=JOURNAL OF THE FELLOWSHIP OF QUAKERS IN THE ARTS|date=Spring 2001|issue=21|url=http://www.quaker.org/fqa/types/t21-woolf.html|accessdate=10 December 2015}}</ref>{{sfn|Bloom|Maynard|1994}}{{sfn|Bicknell|1996}} Meanwhile, Anny was falling in love with her younger cousin [[Richmond Ritchie]], to Leslie Stephen's consternation. Ritchie became a constant visitor and they became engaged in May 1877, and were married on 2 August. At the same time Leslie Stephen was seeing more and more of Julia Duckworth.\n\n==== (2) Julia Duckworth 1878\u20131895====\n[[File:Julia Duckworth in Garden, by Julia Margaret Cameron.jpg|thumb|Julia Duckworth by [[Julia Margaret Cameron]], 1872]]\n{{see also|Julia Duckworth}}\nHis second marriage was to [[Julia Stephen|Julia Prinsep Duckworth]] (n\u00e9e Jackson, 1846\u20131895). Julia had been born in India and after returning to England she became a model for [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood|Pre-Raphaelite]] painters such as [[Edward Burne-Jones]].<ref>[http://www.smith.edu/libraries/libs/rarebook/exhibitions/stephen/31a.htm Smith College libraries biography of Julia Prinsep Stephen]</ref> In 1867 she had married Herbert Duckworth (1833 \u2212 1870) by whom  she had three children prior to his death in 1870.\n\nLeslie Stephen and Julia Duckworth were married on 26 March 1878. They had four children:\n* [[Vanessa Bell|Vanessa]] (1879\u20131961) married [[Clive Bell]]\n* [[Thoby Stephen|Thoby]] (1880\u20131906)\n* [[Virginia Woolf|Virginia]] (1882\u20131941) married [[Leonard Woolf]]\n* [[Adrian Stephen|Adrian]] (1883\u20131948)\n\nIn May 1895, Julia died of influenza, leaving her husband with four young children aged 11 to 15 (her children by her first marriage being adult by then).{{sfn|G\u00e9rin|1981|loc=p.&nbsp;178}}\n\n=== Career===\n\nIn the 1850s, Stephen and his brother James Fitzjames Stephen were invited by [[Frederick Denison Maurice]] to lecture at [[The Working Men's College]]. Leslie Stephen became a member of the College's governing College Corporation.<ref name=Harrison>[[J. F. C. Harrison]], ''A History of the Working Men's College (1854\u20131954),'' Routledge Kegan Paul (1954)</ref>\n\nStephen was an [[Honorary Fellow]] of [[Trinity Hall, Cambridge]], and received the honorary degree [[Doctor of Letters]] (D. Litt.) from the [[University of Cambridge]] and from the [[University of Oxford]] (November 1901<ref>{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=University intelligence |day_of_week=Wednesday |date=27 November 1901 |page_number=6 |issue=36623| }}</ref>).\nWhile at Cambridge, Stephen became an [[Anglican]] clergyman. In 1865, having renounced his religious beliefs, and after a visit to the United States two years earlier, where he had formed lasting friendships with [[Oliver Wendell Holmes,&nbsp;Jr.]], [[James Russell Lowell]] and [[Charles Eliot Norton]], he settled in London and became a journalist, eventually editing the ''[[Cornhill Magazine]]'' in 1871 where [[Robert Louis Stevenson|R.&nbsp;L. Stevenson]], [[Thomas Hardy]], [[William Edward Norris|W.&nbsp;E. Norris]], [[Henry James]], and [[James Payn]] figured among his contributors.\n\nIn his spare time, he participated in athletics and [[mountaineering]]. He also contributed to the ''Saturday Review'', ''Fraser'', ''Macmillan'', the ''Fortnightly'', and other periodicals. He was already known as a climber, as a contributor to ''Peaks, Passes and Glaciers'' (1862), and as one of the earliest presidents of the [[Alpine Club]], when, in 1871, in commemoration of his own [[first ascent]]s in the [[Alps]], he published ''The Playground of Europe'', which immediately became a mountaineering classic, drawing\u2014together with [[Edward Whymper|Whymper]]'s ''Scrambles Amongst the Alps''\u2014successive generations of its readers to the Alps.\n\nDuring the eleven years of his editorship, in addition to three volumes of critical studies, he made two valuable contributions to philosophical history and theory. The first was ''The History of English Thought in the Eighteenth Century'' (1876 and 1881). This work was generally recognised as an important addition to philosophical literature and led immediately to Stephen's election at the [[Athenaeum Club, London|Athenaeum Club]] in 1877. The second was ''The Science of Ethics'' (1882). It was extensively adopted as a textbook on the subject and made him the best-known proponent of [[evolutionary ethics]] in late-nineteenth-century Britain.  He was elected a member of the [[American Antiquarian Society]] in 1901.<ref>[http://www.americanantiquarian.org/memberlists American Antiquarian Society Members Directory]</ref>\n\nStephen also served as the first editor (1885\u201391) of the ''[[Dictionary of National Biography]]''.\n\nHe was appointed a Knight Commander of the [[Order of the Bath]] (KCB) in the [[1902 Coronation Honours]] list published on 26 June 1902.<ref>{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=The Coronation Honours |day_of_week=Thursday |date=26 June 1902 |page_number=5 |issue=36804| }}</ref><ref>{{London Gazette |issue=27453 |date=11 July 1902 |page=4441}}</ref>\n\n=== Humanism ===\n\nAs an adult, Stephen was an [[agnostic atheist]] who wrote extensively about his views. In ''Social Rights and Duties'', he explained how he came to lose his faith of his parents: \"When I ceased to accept the teaching of my youth, it was not so much a process of giving up beliefs as of discovering that I never really believed.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Life and Letters of Leslie Stephen|page=133|editor=Frederic William Maitland|year=2012}}</ref> His second wife, Julia, was similarly activist in her writings on agnosticism.\n\nHe advocated for more people of this view to claim the label \"agnostic\" for themselves, eschewing the harder associations of the unadorned term \"atheist\", reflecting the fact that no one who claims a disbelief in gods does so on the basis of professing absolute ''knowledge'' about the universe. He concluded his essay, \"An Agnostic's Apology,\" with a reply to religious critics who hold atheists and agnostics in contempt, writing: \n\n{{quote|\"Til then, we shall be content to admit openly what you whisper under your breath or hide in technical jargon, that the ancient secret is secret still; that man knows nothing of the Infinite and Absolute; and that, knowing nothing, he had better not be dogmatic about his ignorance. And, meanwhile, we will endeavour to be as charitable as possible, and whilst you trumpet forth officially your contempt for our skepticism, we will at least try to believe that you are imposed upon by your own bluster.\"|Leslie Stephen<ref>{{cite book|chapter=An Agnostic's Apology|last=Stephen|first=Leslie|editor=[[Christopher Hitchens]]|title=The Portable Atheist|page=111|publisher=Da Capo Press|year=2007}}</ref> }}\n\nStephen was very involved in the organised [[humanism|humanist movement]], even serving multiple terms as President of the West London Ethical Society (part of the Union of Ethical Societies, which became [[Humanists UK]]).<ref>{{cite book|title=Leslie Stephen's life in letters: a bibliographical study|last=Fenwick|first=Gillian|page =125|year=1993}}</ref> He gave numerous addresses and lectures to the ethical society during his tenure as President, which are collected at length across multiple volumes of humanist writing. He was an active organiser in the movement, and in one lecture, entitled \"The aims of ethical societies,\" set about the task of defining the broader social purpose which animated the wider [[Ethical Culture|Ethical movement]] at that time.<ref>{{cite book|title=Social Rights And Duties: Addresses to Ethical Societies (Complete)|author=Sir Leslie Stephen|year=2002|publisher=Library of Alexandria}}</ref>\n\n=== Mountaineering ===\n[[File:Sir Leslie Stephen by George Frederic Watts 1878.jpeg|thumb|right|Leslie Stephen painted by [[George Frederic Watts]], 1878.]]\nStephen was one of the most prominent figures in the [[golden age of alpinism]] (the period between [[Alfred Wills|Wills]]'s ascent of the [[Wetterhorn]] in 1854 and [[Edward Whymper|Whymper]]'s ascent of the [[Matterhorn]] in 1865) during which many major alpine peaks saw their first ascents. Joining the [[Alpine Club (UK)|Alpine Club]] in 1857 (the year of its formation), Stephen made the first ascent, usually in the company of his favourite Swiss guide [[Melchior Anderegg]], of the following peaks:\n*[[Wildstrubel]] \u2013 11 September 1858 with [[Thomas Woodbine Hinchliff|T.

His father was Colonial Undersecretary of State and a noted [[abolitionist]]. He was the fourth of five children, his siblings including [[James Fitzjames Stephen]] (1829\u20131894) and [[Caroline Emelia Stephen]] (1834\u20131909).\n\nHis family had belonged to the [[Clapham Sect]], the early 19th century group of mainly [[evangelicalism|evangelical]] Christian [[social reform]]ers. At his father's house he saw a good deal of the [[Zachary Macaulay|Macaulays]], [[James Spedding]], Sir [[Henry Taylor (dramatist)|Henry Taylor]] and [[Nassau William Senior|Nassau Senior]]. Leslie Stephen was educated at [[Eton College]], [[King's College London]] and [[Trinity Hall, Cambridge]], where he graduated B.A. (20th [[Wrangler (University of Cambridge)|wrangler]]) in 1854 and M.A. in 1857. He was elected a [[fellow]] of Trinity Hall in 1854 and became a junior tutor in 1856.{{sfn|ACAD|STFN850L}} In 1859 he was [[ordained]] but his study of philosophy, together with the religious controversies surrounding the publication of [[The Origin of Species]] (1859) by [[Charles Darwin]], caused him to lose his faith in 1862, and in 1864 he resigned from his positions at Cambridge, and moved to London. He recounted some of his experiences in a chapter in his ''Life of Fawcett'' as well as in some less formal ''Sketches from Cambridge: By a Don'' (1865). These sketches were reprinted from the ''[[Pall Mall Gazette]]'', to the proprietor of which, [[George Murray Smith]], he had been introduced by his brother.{{sfn|Luebering|2006}}\n\n=== Marriage ===\n\n==== (1) Harriet (Minny) Thackeray 1867\u20131875====\n[[File:Harriet and Leslie Stephen 1867.jpg|thumb|Harriet and Leslie Stephen, 1867]]\n[[File:Harriet Marian Thackeray Stephen, Kensal Green Cemetery.JPG|thumb|Harriet's grave, Kensal Green Cemetery]]\nThe family connections included that of [[William Makepeace Thackeray]]. His brother, Fitzjames had been a friend of Thackeray's and assisted in the disposition of his estate when he died in 1863. His sister Caroline met Thackeray's daughters, [[Anne Isabella Thackeray|Anny]] (1837\u20131919) and Minny (Harriet Marian Thackeray 1840\u20131875) when they were mutual guests of [[Julia Margaret Cameron]] (of whom, see later). This led to an invitation to visit from Leslie Stephen's mother, Lady Stephen, where the sisters met him. They also met at George Murray Smith's house at Hampstead. Minny and Leslie became engaged on 4 December 1866 and married on 19 June 1867. After the wedding they travelled to the Swiss Alps and northern Italy, and on return to England lived at the Thackeray sister's home at 16 Onslow Gardens with Anny, who was a novelist. In the spring of 1868 Minny [[miscarried]] but recovered sufficiently for the couple to tour the eastern United States. Minny miscarried again in 1869, but became pregnant again in 1870 and on 7 December gave birth to their daughter, Laura Makepeace Stephen (1870\u20131945). Laura was premature, weighing three pounds. In March 1873 Thackeray and the Stephens moved to 8 Southwell Gardens. The couple travelled extensively, and by 1875 Minny was pregnant again, but this time was in poor health. On 27 November she developed convulsions, and died the following day of [[eclampsia]].{{sfn|Bicknell|1996}}\n\nAfter Minny's death, Leslie Stephen continued to live with Anny, but they moved to 11 Hyde Park gate South in 1876, next door to her widowed friend and collaborator, Julia Duckworth. Leslie Stephen and his daughter were also cared for by his sister, the writer [[Caroline Emelia Stephen]], although Leslie described her as \"Silly Milly\" and her books as \"little works\".<ref name=lewis>{{cite journal|last1=Lewis|first1=Alison M|title=Caroline Stephen and her niece, Virginia Woolf|journal=JOURNAL OF THE FELLOWSHIP OF QUAKERS IN THE ARTS|date=Spring 2001|issue=21|url=http://www.quaker.org/fqa/types/t21-woolf.html|accessdate=10 December 2015}}</ref>{{sfn|Bloom|Maynard|1994}}{{sfn|Bicknell|1996}} Meanwhile, Anny was falling in love with her younger cousin [[Richmond Ritchie]], to Leslie Stephen's consternation. Ritchie became a constant visitor and they became engaged in May 1877, and were married on 2 August. At the same time Leslie Stephen was seeing more and more of Julia Duckworth.\n\n==== (2) Julia Duckworth 1878\u20131895====\n[[File:Julia Duckworth in Garden, by Julia Margaret Cameron.jpg|thumb|Julia Duckworth by [[Julia Margaret Cameron]], 1872]]\n{{see also|Julia Duckworth}}\nHis second marriage was to [[Julia Stephen|Julia Prinsep Duckworth]] (n\u00e9e Jackson, 1846\u20131895). Julia had been born in India and after returning to England she became a model for [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood|Pre-Raphaelite]] painters such as [[Edward Burne-Jones]].<ref>[http://www.smith.edu/libraries/libs/rarebook/exhibitions/stephen/31a.htm Smith College libraries biography of Julia Prinsep Stephen]</ref> In 1867 she had married Herbert Duckworth (1833 \u2212 1870) by whom  she had three children prior to his death in 1870.\n\nLeslie Stephen and Julia Duckworth were married on 26 March 1878. They had four children:\n* [[Vanessa Bell|Vanessa]] (1879\u20131961) married [[Clive Bell]]\n* [[Thoby Stephen|Thoby]] (1880\u20131906)\n* [[Virginia Woolf|Virginia]] (1882\u20131941) married [[Leonard Woolf]]\n* [[Adrian Stephen|Adrian]] (1883\u20131948)\n\nIn May 1895, Julia died of influenza, leaving her husband with four young children aged 11 to 15 (her children by her first marriage being adult by then).{{sfn|G\u00e9rin|1981|loc=p.&nbsp;178}}\n\n=== Career===\n\nIn the 1850s, Stephen and his brother James Fitzjames Stephen were invited by [[Frederick Denison Maurice]] to lecture at [[The Working Men's College]]. Leslie Stephen became a member of the College's governing College Corporation.<ref name=Harrison>[[J. F. C. Harrison]], ''A History of the Working Men's College (1854\u20131954),'' Routledge Kegan Paul (1954)</ref>\n\nStephen was an [[Honorary Fellow]] of [[Trinity Hall, Cambridge]], and received the honorary degree [[Doctor of Letters]] (D. Litt.) from the [[University of Cambridge]] and from the [[University of Oxford]] (November 1901<ref>{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=University intelligence |day_of_week=Wednesday |date=27 November 1901 |page_number=6 |issue=36623| }}</ref>).\nWhile at Cambridge, Stephen became an [[Anglican]] clergyman. In 1865, having renounced his religious beliefs, and after a visit to the United States two years earlier, where he had formed lasting friendships with [[Oliver Wendell Holmes,&nbsp;Jr.]], [[James Russell Lowell]] and [[Charles Eliot Norton]], he settled in London and became a journalist, eventually editing the ''[[Cornhill Magazine]]'' in 1871 where [[Robert Louis Stevenson|R.&nbsp;L. Stevenson]], [[Thomas Hardy]], [[William Edward Norris|W.&nbsp;E. Norris]], [[Henry James]], and [[James Payn]] figured among his contributors.\n\nIn his spare time, he participated in athletics and [[mountaineering]]. He also contributed to the ''Saturday Review'', ''Fraser'', ''Macmillan'', the ''Fortnightly'', and other periodicals. He was already known as a climber, as a contributor to ''Peaks, Passes and Glaciers'' (1862), and as one of the earliest presidents of the [[Alpine Club]], when, in 1871, in commemoration of his own [[first ascent]]s in the [[Alps]], he published ''The Playground of Europe'', which immediately became a mountaineering classic, drawing\u2014together with [[Edward Whymper|Whymper]]'s ''Scrambles Amongst the Alps''\u2014successive generations of its readers to the Alps.\n\nDuring the eleven years of his editorship, in addition to three volumes of critical studies, he made two valuable contributions to philosophical history and theory. The first was ''The History of English Thought in the Eighteenth Century'' (1876 and 1881). This work was generally recognised as an important addition to philosophical literature and led immediately to Stephen's election at the [[Athenaeum Club, London|Athenaeum Club]] in 1877. The second was ''The Science of Ethics'' (1882). It was extensively adopted as a textbook on the subject and made him the best-known proponent of [[evolutionary ethics]] in late-nineteenth-century Britain.  He was elected a member of the [[American Antiquarian Society]] in 1901.<ref>[http://www.americanantiquarian.org/memberlists American Antiquarian Society Members Directory]</ref>\n\nStephen also served as the first editor (1885\u201391) of the ''[[Dictionary of National Biography]]''.\n\nHe was appointed a Knight Commander of the [[Order of the Bath]] (KCB) in the [[1902 Coronation Honours]] list published on 26 June 1902.<ref>{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=The Coronation Honours |day_of_week=Thursday |date=26 June 1902 |page_number=5 |issue=36804| }}</ref><ref>{{London Gazette |issue=27453 |date=11 July 1902 |page=4441}}</ref>\n\n=== Humanism ===\n\nAs an adult, Stephen was an [[agnostic atheist]] who wrote extensively about his views. In ''Social Writes and Duties'', he explained how he came to lose his faith of his parents: \"When I ceased to accept the teaching of my youth, it was not so much a process of giving up beliefs as of discovering that I never really believed.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Life and Letters of Leslie Stephen|page=133|editor=Frederic William Maitland|year=2012}}</ref> His second wife, Julia, was similarly activist in her writings on agnosticism.\n\nHe advocated for more people of this view to claim the label \"agnostic\" for themselves, eschewing the harder associations of the unadorned term \"atheist\", reflecting the fact that no one who claims a disbelief in gods does so on the basis of professing absolute ''knowledge'' about the universe. He concluded his essay, \"An Agnostic's Apology,\" with a reply to religious critics who hold atheists and agnostics in contempt, writing: \n\n{{quote|\"Til then, we shall be content to admit openly what you whisper under your breath or hide in technical jargon, that the ancient secret is secret still; that man knows nothing of the Infinite and Absolute; and that, knowing nothing, he had better not be dogmatic about his ignorance. And, meanwhile, we will endeavour to be as charitable as possible, and whilst you trumpet forth officially your contempt for our skepticism, we will at least try to believe that you are imposed upon by your own bluster.\"|Leslie Stephen<ref>{{cite book|chapter=An Agnostic's Apology|last=Stephen|first=Leslie|editor=[[Christopher Hitchens]]|title=The Portable Atheist|page=111|publisher=Da Capo Press|year=2007}}</ref> }}\n\nStephen was very involved in the organised [[humanism|humanist movement]], even serving multiple terms as President of the West London Ethical Society (part of the Union of Ethical Societies, which became [[Humanists UK]]).<ref>{{cite book|title=Leslie Stephen's life in letters: a bibliographical study|last=Fenwick|first=Gillian|page =125|year=1993}}</ref> He gave numerous addresses and lectures to the ethical society during his tenure as President, which are collected at length across multiple volumes of humanist writing. He was an active organiser in the movement, and in one lecture, entitled \"The aims of ethical societies,\" set about the task of defining the broader social purpose which animated the wider [[Ethical Culture|Ethical movement]] at that time.<ref>{{cite book|title=Social Rights And Duties: Addresses to Ethical Societies (Complete)|author=Sir Leslie Stephen|year=2002|publisher=Library of Alexandria}}</ref>\n\n=== Mountaineering ===\n[[File:Sir Leslie Stephen by George Frederic Watts 1878.jpeg|thumb|right|Leslie Stephen painted by [[George Frederic Watts]], 1878.]]\nStephen was one of the most prominent figures in the [[golden age of alpinism]] (the period between [[Alfred Wills|Wills]]'s ascent of the [[Wetterhorn]] in 1854 and [[Edward Whymper|Whymper]]'s ascent of the [[Matterhorn]] in 1865) during which many major alpine peaks saw their first ascents. Joining the [[Alpine Club (UK)|Alpine Club]] in 1857 (the year of its formation), Stephen made the first ascent, usually in the company of his favourite Swiss guide [[Melchior Anderegg]], of the following peaks:\n*[[Wildstrubel]] \u2013 11 September 1858 with [[Thomas Woodbine Hinchliff|T.

Built in 1851 in the [[Scottish Baronial]] style by William Mitchell-Innes, then [[List of Scottish feudal baronies|feudal baron of Ayton]], to the design of [[James Gillespie Graham]]]]\n\nIn [[Scotland]], a '''baron''' is the head of a [[feudal baron]]y, also known as a prescriptive barony. This used to be attached to a particular piece of land on which was situated the ''[[caput]]'' ([[Latin]] for \"head\") or essence of the barony, normally a building, such as a castle or manor house. Accordingly, the owner of the piece of land containing the ''caput'' was called a [[baron]] (or baroness).\n\nThe [[Court of the Lord Lyon]] issued a ruling in April 2015 that recognises a person possessing the dignity of baron and other feudal titles (lordship/earl/marquis). The [[Lord Lyon King of Arms]] now prefers the approach of recognizing the particular feudal noble dignity as expressed in the Crown Charter that the petitioner presents.<ref name=\"lyon-court.com\">http://www.lyon-court.com/lordlyon/files/Menking%20Decision.pdf</ref> These titles are recognised as the status of a minor baron but not a peer. Scottish feudal baronies may be passed to any person, of either sex, by inheritance or conveyance.<ref>{{cite book |first=Professor Kenneth |last=Reid |year=2003 |title=The Abolition of Feudal Tenure in Scotland |location=Edinburgh |publisher=Tottel}}</ref>\n\nScotland has a [[Scots Law|distinct legal system]] within the [[United Kingdom]]. Historically, in the [[Kingdom of Scotland]], the Lord Lyon King of Arms, as the Sovereign's minister in matters armorial, is at once [[herald]] and [[judge]]. The Scottish equivalent of an English baron is a [[Lord of Parliament]].\n\n==History==\nA \"Scottish Prescriptive Barony by [[Land tenure|Tenure]]\" was, from [[Tenures Abolition Act 1660|1660]] until 2004, the [[Feudalism|feudal]] description of the only genuine degree of title of [[United Kingdom|UK]] [[nobility]] capable of being bought and sold (along with the ''caput'', or property), rather than passing strictly by blood inheritance.\n\nStatutes of 1592 and the ''Baronetcy Warrants'' of [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] show the non-peerage Table of Precedence as: [[Baronet]]s, [[Knight]]s, [[Baron]]s and [[Laird (title)|Lairds]], [[Esquire]] and [[Gentlemen]].\n\nA ''[[Sasine|General Register of Sasines]]'' was set up by Statute in 1617, with entry in the Register giving the ''prescriptive'' right (right by normal or correct usage), after so many years, to the ''caput'' or essence of the barony. The individual who owned the said piece of land containing the ''caput'' was hence the baron or baroness. Uncertainty over armorial right was removed by the ''Lyon Register'' being set up by Statute in 1672, such that no arms were to be borne in Scotland unless validly entered in Lyon Register.\n\nUp until 1874, each new baron was confirmed in his barony by the Crown by Charter of Confirmation. Up until 28 November 2004, a barony was an [[estate (land)|estate]] of land held directly of [[the Crown]], or the [[Prince and Great Steward of Scotland]]. It was an essential element of a barony title that there existed a Crown [[Charter]] erecting the land into a barony, recorded in the Register of the [[Great Seal of Scotland]]. Often the original Charter was later lost, however an Official Extract has the same [[legal status]] as the original Charter.\n\nFrom the [[Treaty of Union]] of 1707 - until 1999 - a unified [[Parliament of Great Britain]] (since January, 1801, known as the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]), at [[Palace of Westminster|Westminster]], was responsible for passing legislation affecting [[private law]] both north and south of the [[Scotland|Scottish]] border. In 1999, the devolved [[Scottish Parliament]] was established, and private law measures can now be passed at [[Holyrood, Edinburgh|Holyrood]], the seat of the Scottish Parliament in [[Edinburgh]].\n\nUsing a \"prescriptive feudal grant\" allowed developers to impose [[Eternity|perpetual]] conditions affecting the land. The courts became willing to accept the validity of such obligations, which became known as \"real burdens\". In practical and commercial terms, these real burdens were like English [[leasehold]] tenure.\n\n==Abolition of feudal tenure==\nThe first [[Scottish Executive]] was committed to abolishing the [[anachronism]] of the [[Feudalism|feudal system]]. On 28 November 2004, the ''[[Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000]]'' came into full force and effect, putting an end to Scotland's feudal system. Under [[Scots law]], a Scottish Prescriptive Barony by Tenure is now \"incorporeal feudal heritage\", not attached to the land and remains the only genuine, ''prescriptive'', degree of title of UK nobility capable of being bought and sold \u2013 since under Section 63(1) of the Act, the dignity of baron is preserved after the abolition of the feudal system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2000/5/section/63 |title=Section 63 |work=Abolition of Feudal Tenure, etc (Scotland) Act 2000}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/deleted/library/documents-w10/afs2-12.htm |work=Report on Abolition of Feudal System |title=Appendix A12: ''See Explanatory Notes on Clause 57 Subsection (2)'' |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041119234609/http://www.scotland.gov.uk/deleted/library/documents-w10/afs2-12.htm |archivedate=19 November 2004 }}</ref> However, the Abolition Act did end the ability to get feudal land privileges by inheriting or acquiring the ''caput'' (land or castle) in Scotland.  In [[common law]] jurisdictions, land may still be owned and inherited through a barony if the land is titled in \"the Baron of X\" as baron rather than in the individual's name.  In America, it passes with the barony as a [[fee simple]] appurtenance to an otherwise [[incorporeal hereditament]], the barony being treated like a landowning [[corporation]].<ref>{{cite court  |litigants=Re Notarial Instrument of the Earl of Galloway; Disposition; Warrant for Letters Patent |reporter=No.s 103, 104, 105, ''Palmyra Island Land Recordation'', United States District Court for the District of Hawaii |date=2017 |court=D.C. Hawaii-Palmyra I.}}</ref> In Scotland, the practice has not been tested in a [[Court of Session]] case since the Act.\n\nWhat is possibly the oldest barony in Scotland, the [[Clan MacLea|Barony of the Bachuil]], has not depended on land ownership for centuries; the barony passes along with the possession of a certain ancient stick, \"The Bachuil M\u00f3r\", which was once the bishop's staff of the [[Picts|Pictish]] [[Moluag|Saint Moluag]] in the year 562.  Unlike all other barons in Scotland, the lawful possessor of the stick is the Baron of the Bachuil, regardless of landholdings.<ref name=\"bachuil\">{{cite book |title=The MacLeas or Livingstones and their Allodial Barony of the Bachuil |first=Niall |last=Livingston of the Bachuil, yr. |publisher= Baronage Press |date=2006 |url=http://baronage.co.uk/2006a/Bachuil.pdf |access-date= 2018-05-21}}</ref>\n\nAfter 28 November 2004 under Scots law, a Scottish barony, which was previously Scottish heritable property (real property), became incorporeal heritable property (not attached to the land). Prior to the Act coming into effect, Scottish feudal baronies (including lordships and earldoms) were the only genuine title of UK nobility capable of being transferred following the sale of land containing a ''caput'' (or the sale of a feudal superiority).\n\nMost baronies were created (erected) prior to 1745, but one was erected as late as 1824. Since the Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000 came into effect, the [[Lord Lyon]], who is the Chief Herald of Scotland, has restored a more traditional form to the [[coat of arms]] of a baron. Barons are now identified by the helm befitting their degree. A new policy statement has been made by the Lord Lyon to this effect.\n\nIndependent Scots legal advice should always be taken before entering into any contract that claims to offer a baronial title for sale. The holder of the dignity of a barony may petition the Lord Lyon for a [[Grant of Arms|grant of arms]], as he falls under the jurisdiction of the [[Court of the Lord Lyon|Lyon's Court]]. A policy statement has been made to this effect by the Lord Lyon.<ref name=\"lyon-court.com\"/> The Lyon Court has no jurisdiction in relation to the transfer of, or legal \"trade\" in, feudal titles.

The Scottish equivalent of an English baron is \"[[List of Barons|Lord of Parliament]]\".\n\nThe feudal baronial title tends to be used when a landed family is not in possession of any United Kingdom peerage title of higher rank, subsequently granted, or has been created a knight of the [[realm]].  The name recorded by the [[Lord Lyon]] as part of any grant of arms or matriculation becomes the holder's name for all official purposes.\n\nThe holder of a Scottish barony (''e.g.'', \"Inverglen\") may add the title to his existing name (''e.g.'', \"John Smith, Baron of Inverglen\") or add the territorial designation to his surname if still in possession of the caput (\"John Smith of Inverglen, Baron of Inverglen\"); some of the oldest Scottish families prefer to be styled by the [[territorial designation]] alone (\"Smith of Inverglen\").<ref name=\"scotsbarons1\">{{cite web |url=http://www.scotsbarons.org/titles_and_usages.htm |title=Titles and Usages |publisher=Scotsbarons.org |accessdate=17 March 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150225165126/http://www.scotsbarons.org/titles_and_usages.htm |archivedate=25 February 2015  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.debretts.com/forms-of-address/titles/scottish--and-irish-titles/scottish-feudal-baronies.aspx |title=Scottish Feudal Baronies, Scottish and Irish Titles, Titles, Forms Of Address &#124; Debrett's |publisher=Debretts.com |accessdate=17 March 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130725234418/http://www.debretts.com/forms-of-address/titles/scottish--and-irish-titles/scottish-feudal-baronies.aspx |archivedate=25 July 2013  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.peerage.org/genealogy/Baronies.htm#Forms_of_address |title=Scottish feudal baronies (feudal barons, feudal baron) including the oath of a knight |publisher=Peerage.org |accessdate=17 March 2015}}</ref> Formal and in writing, they are styled as [[The Much Honoured]] Baron of Inverglen.

If accepted (and if the applicant wishes to include the title), the correct form is for the applicant to include the territorial designation as part of their surname (Surname of territorial designation e.g. ''Smith of Inverglen''). The Observation would then show the holder's full name, followed by their feudal title e.g. ''The holder is John Smith, Baron of Inverglen''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/118548/titles-included-in-passports.pdf |title=Titles included in passports |page=3 |publisher=UK government website}}</ref>\n\n==Scottish heraldry==\n[[File:ScotsBaronsHelm.JPG|thumb|A Scottish baron's [[Barons in Scotland#Helmet|helmet]]]]\nThe former Lord Lyon declined to award the following baronial additaments to the arms of those feudal barons registering arms now that the Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000 is in force.  However, the current Lord Lyon has confirmed in a recent policy statement that he will officially recognise feudal barons or those possessing the dignity of baron who meet certain conditions and will grant them arms with a helmet befitting their degree. Scottish Barons rank below Lords of Parliament; while noble, they are not conventionally considered peerage titles. Unlike others, the titles can be hereditary or bought and sold.\n\nIn showing that Scottish barons are titles of nobility, reference may be made, amongst others, to Lyon Court in the Petition of Maclean of Ardgour for a Birthbrieve by Interlocutor dated 26 February 1943 which \"Finds and Declares that the Minor Barons of Scotland are, and have both in this Nobiliary Court, and in the Court of Session, been recognised as 'titled' nobility, and that the estait of the Baronage (The Barones Minores) is of the ancient Feudal Nobility of Scotland\".\n\nSir Thomas Innes of Learney in his 'Scots Heraldry' (2nd Ed., p.&nbsp;88, note 1) states that 'The Act 1672, cap 47, specially qualifies the degrees thus: Nobles (i.e. peers, the term being here used in a restricted seventeenth-century English sense), Barons (i.e. Lairds of baronial fiefs and their \"heirs\", who, even if fiefless, are equivalent to heads of Continental baronial houses) and Gentlemen (apparently all other armigers).' Baronets and knights are evidently classed as 'Gentlemen' here and are of a lower degree than Barons. The Scottish Head of Baronial Houses, includes all the various styles and titles which designate the territorial nobility i.e. baron of X.\n\nBarons may also wear two eagle feathers when in traditional dress.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tartansauthority.com/highland-dress/modern/how-to-wear-the-kilt/some-advice/ |title=How to wear the kilt &#124; Scottish Tartans Authority |publisher=Tartansauthority.com |accessdate=17 March 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scotsbarons.org/hereditary_offices.htm |title=Hereditary offices |publisher=Scotsbarons.org |accessdate=17 March 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150226024221/http://www.scotsbarons.org/hereditary_offices.htm |archivedate=26 February 2015}}</ref> If the baron is a member of a clan, it is advisable to consult the clan chief on clan customs and traditions. The Lord Lyon only gives guidance and not governance on the wearing of feathers and recommends consulting with a clan chief.\n\n===Chapeau===\n[[File:Azure Chapeau.PNG|thumb|An azure [[chapeau]]]]\nPreviously, between the 1930s and 2004, when new arms were granted or a matriculation of existing arms took note of a barony, the owner was given a ''[[chapeau]]'' or [[cap of maintenance]] as part of his [[Coat of arms|armorial achievement]] on petitioning for the same. This chapeau is described as \"gules doubled ermine\" for barons in possession of the caput of the barony. An azure chapeau is appropriate for the heirs of ancient baronial families who are no longer owners of the estates. This chapeau was a relatively recent armorial invention of the late [[Lord Lyon]] [[Thomas Innes of Learney]].  Accordingly, a number of ancient arms of feudal barons do not display the chapeau, and now it is no longer granted.\n\nAt the [[Treaty of Perth]] in 1266, Norway relinquished its claim to the Hebrides and Man, and they became part of Scotland. In 1292, Argyll was created a shire and \"The Barons of all [[Argyll]] and the [[Lord of the Isles|Foreigners' Isles]]\", which had preceded the kingdom of Scotland, became eligible to attend the \"Scots\" Parliament&nbsp;\u2013 appearing in the record of the parliament at [[St Andrews|St. Andrews]] in 1309. Historically they have a chapeau, \"gules doubled ermines\", [[Ermine (heraldry)#Later variations|ermines]] being white tails on black.\n\nThere is a unique exception: the [[Bachuil|Barony of the Bachuil]] is not of feudal origin like other baronies but is [[Allodial title|allodial]] in that it predates (562 A.D.) Scotland itself and the feudal system, dating from the [[Gaels|Gaelic]] Kingdom of [[D\u00e1l Riata]]. In recognition as allodial ''Barons par la gr\u00e2ce de Dieu'' not barons by a [[feudal]] crown grant, the Baron of the Bachuil has the only chapeau allowed to have a [[vair]] ([[squirrel]] fur) lining.<ref name=\"bachuil\"/>\n\nA chapeau, if part of an armorial achievement, is placed into the space directly above the shield and below the helmet. It may otherwise be used on a [[visiting card]], the flap of an envelope, or to ensign the circlet of a crest badge as used on a bonnet.\n\n===Feudo-baronial mantle===\n[[File:Barony Robe and Chapeau.PNG|thumb|The historical Scottish baron's mantle and chapeau from the 1930s to 2004, which are no longer granted]]\nParticularly Scottish in character is the ''feudo-baronial mantle'' or robe of estate - described as gules doubled silk argent, fur-edged of miniver and collared in ermine, fastened on the right shoulder by five spherical buttons Or. This may be displayed in a [[Mantle and pavilion (heraldry)|pavilioned form]], draped behind the complete achievement of arms - or the armorial shield alone - tied open with cords and tassels, and surmounted by the chapeau. Again, Lord Lyon is no longer granting these heraldic mantles.\n\n===Helmet===\nThe ''helmet'' is now the chief mode of recognition of a Scottish baron.  The Lord Lyon has adopted a steel helm with grille of three grilles, garnished in gold, as the current baronial additament.  Alternatively, a feudal steel tilting helm garnished in gold, that may be shown affront\u00e9, may appear, or a helmet of some other degree if the baron holds a higher rank, such as a lordship of parliament.\n\n===Supporters===\n''[[Supporters]]'', are now usually reserved for the holders of the older baronies (chartered before 1587) and those that have been in continuous [[Family business|family ownership]]. In England, supporters are reserved for the peerage, and a Scottish baron who approaches the English [[College of Arms]] is not allowed supporters. A ''compartment'' has occasionally been granted to barons, representing their territories, even in cases where there are no supporters.\n\n===Badge===\nA ''badge'' \u2013 distinct from the ''crest'' \u2013 as a separate armorial device, is not necessarily a feature of the arms. The badge may be used by the \"tail\" or following of a landowner baron. The grant is linked to the baron's ''standard'', a heraldic flag, in the [[livery]] colours that carries a large representation of the badge. The standard is blazoned in the grant or matriculation. The livery colours are usually the two most prominent colours of the arms themselves.\n\n===Flags===\nA ''Standard'' \u2013 an elongated shape, tapering from 1.2 m down to 60&nbsp;cm, with the fly edge split and rounded (lanceolate). The length is according to rank, from 7.5 m for the Sovereign down to 3.5 m for a Knight, '''Baron''' or Chief. It bears the Arms as on the shield or the saltire in the hoist, with the tail parted per fess with the Crest, Badge and/or Supporter, plus the motto on one or more Ribands. The Standard is set before the '''Baron/Chief's''' tent (as it's a \"Headquarters\" flag and does not indicate that the Armiger is in residence) rather than carried like the banner. A Standard requires a separate grant by the Lord Lyon and is only made under certain conditions.\n\nA ''Guidon'' \u2013 one-third shorter than a Standard and tapering to a round, unsplit end at the fly. These are assigned by Lord Lyon to individuals who have Supporters to their Arms, and to others who have a following \u2013 those in a position of leadership or some official position.\n\nA ''Pennon'' \u2013 a smaller, elongated flag 4&nbsp;ft long with a pointed, rounded or swallow-tailed end, designed to be displayed on a lance, assigned by Lord Lyon King to an Armiger who applies for one. It is charged with the motto of the armiger as well as the arms as on the shield.\n\nA ''Banner'' \u2013 a square or rectangular upright representation of the Arms designed for carrying in warfare or tournaments, but now flown as a \"house flag\" when the Armiger is in residence and is NOT the flag of the Clan or Family.  Originally, conspicuous gallantry in battle was marked by cutting off the tail of the Standard or Pennon, turning it into a Banner. Strictly speaking, the sizes and shapes are:\n \n''Square banner'' \u2013 Sovereign, 1.5 m square; Dukes; 1.25 m sq; Earls, 1.1 m sq; Viscounts and Barons, 1 m sq; Baronets and '''feudal barons''', 0.9 m sq; other Armigers, 70&nbsp;cm wide x 85&nbsp;cm high\n \n''Rectangular banner'' \u2013 typically in the ratio 3:2, or 5:4 when flown as the \"house flag\" of an Armiger.\n \n''Carrying flag'' \u2013 this should be sized as follows (width x height): Peers, 1.2 m x 1.5 m; '''Feudal Barons''', 90&nbsp;cm x 115&nbsp;cm; Chiefs, 85&nbsp;cm x 110&nbsp;cm; Chieftains, 80&nbsp;cm x 90&nbsp;cm.\n\nA ''Ensign'' may be occasionally granted and blazoned. This is a square flag, smaller than the flying banner, and carrying the full embroidered achievement (arms, crest, motto), again fringed in livery colours.\n\nA ''Pipe banner'' \u2013 rather similar to a Banner, but of a size to fit on the longest drone of the pipes (usually 45&nbsp;cm) and richly decorated with gold fringing, tassles and the like. The pipe banner for a Chief who is also a Peer or a '''Feudal Baron''' should have a rounded end extending beyond the length, and any other Chief a split rounded end. A feudal baron is authorised two pipers.\n\n==List of Feudal Baronies (created before 1707)==\nBelow is a list of some Scottish feudal baronies created before 1707; this list does not include Scottish feudal baronies created between that year and 1838 (BGH), when the most recent creation of a Scottish feudal barony occurred.\n\n{{Expand list|date=January 2011}}\n:''When updating this list, please create for each new entry a separate, [[WP:Wikify|wikified]] article titled \"Scottish feudal barony of X\", which records a brief biography of the previous incumbent and is wikilinked to this list.

Built in 1851 in the [[Scottish Baronial]] style by William Mitchell-Innes, then [[List of Scottish feudal baronies|feudal baron of Ayton]], to the design of [[James Gillespie Graham]]]]\n\nIn [[Scotland]], a '''baron''' is the head of a [[feudal baron]]y, also known as a prescriptive barony. This used to be attached to a particular piece of land on which was situated the ''[[caput]]'' ([[Latin]] for \"head\") or essence of the barony, normally a building, such as a castle or manor house. Accordingly, the owner of the piece of land containing the ''caput'' was called a [[baron]] (or baroness).\n\nThe [[Court of the Lord Lyon]] issued a ruling in April 2015 that recognises a person possessing the dignity of baron and other feudal titles (lordship/earl/marquis). The [[Lord Lyon King of Arms]] now prefers the approach of recognizing the particular feudal noble dignity as expressed in the Crown Charter that the petitioner presents.<ref name=\"lyon-court.com\">http://www.lyon-court.com/lordlyon/files/Menking%20Decision.pdf</ref> These titles are recognised as the status of a minor baron but not a peer. Scottish feudal baronies may be passed to any person, of either sex, by inheritance or conveyance.<ref>{{cite book |first=Professor Kenneth |last=Reid |year=2003 |title=The Abolition of Feudal Tenure in Scotland |location=Edinburgh |publisher=Tottel}}</ref>\n\nScotland has a [[Scots Law|distinct legal system]] within the [[United Kingdom]]. Historically, in the [[Kingdom of Scotland]], the Lord Lyon King of Arms, as the Sovereign's minister in matters armorial, is at once [[herald]] and [[judge]]. The Scottish equivalent of an English baron is a [[Lord of Parliament]].\n\n==History==\nA \"Scottish Prescriptive Barony by [[Land tenure|Tenure]]\" was, from [[Tenures Abolition Act 1660|1660]] until 2004, the [[Feudalism|feudal]] description of the only genuine degree of title of [[United Kingdom|UK]] [[nobility]] capable of being bought and sold (along with the ''caput'', or property), rather than passing strictly by blood inheritance.\n\nStatutes of 1592 and the ''Baronetcy Warrants'' of [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] show the non-peerage Table of Precedence as: [[Baronet]]s, [[Knight]]s, [[Baron]]s and [[Laird (title)|Lairds]], [[Esquire]] and [[Gentlemen]].\n\nA ''[[Sasine|General Register of Sasines]]'' was set up by Statute in 1617, with entry in the Register giving the ''prescriptive'' right (right by normal or correct usage), after so many years, to the ''caput'' or essence of the barony. The individual who owned the said piece of land containing the ''caput'' was hence the baron or baroness. Uncertainty over armorial right was removed by the ''Lyon Register'' being set up by Statute in 1672, such that no arms were to be borne in Scotland unless validly entered in Lyon Register.\n\nUp until 1874, each new baron was confirmed in his barony by the Crown by Charter of Confirmation. Up until 28 November 2004, a barony was an [[estate (land)|estate]] of land held directly of [[the Crown]], or the [[Prince and Great Steward of Scotland]]. It was an essential element of a barony title that there existed a Crown [[Charter]] erecting the land into a barony, recorded in the Register of the [[Great Seal of Scotland]]. Often the original Charter was later lost, however an Official Extract has the same [[legal status]] as the original Charter.\n\nFrom the [[Treaty of Union]] of 1707 - until 1999 - a unified [[Parliament of Great Britain]] (since January, 1801, known as the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]), at [[Palace of Westminster|Westminster]], was responsible for passing legislation affecting [[private law]] both north and south of the [[Scotland|Scottish]] border. In 1999, the devolved [[Scottish Parliament]] was established, and private law measures can now be passed at [[Holyrood, Edinburgh|Holyrood]], the seat of the Scottish Parliament in [[Edinburgh]].\n\nUsing a \"prescriptive feudal grant\" allowed developers to impose [[Eternity|perpetual]] conditions affecting the land. The courts became willing to accept the validity of such obligations, which became known as \"real burdens\". In practical and commercial terms, these real burdens were like English [[leasehold]] tenure.\n\n==Abolition of feudal tenure==\nThe first [[Scottish Executive]] was committed to abolishing the [[anachronism]] of the [[Feudalism|feudal system]]. On 28 November 2004, the ''[[Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000]]'' came into full force and effect, putting an end to Scotland's feudal system. Under [[Scots law]], a Scottish Prescriptive Barony by Tenure is now \"incorporeal feudal heritage\", not attached to the land and remains the only genuine, ''prescriptive'', degree of title of UK nobility capable of being bought and sold \u2013 since under Section 63(1) of the Act, the dignity of baron is preserved after the abolition of the feudal system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2000/5/section/63 |title=Section 63 |work=Abolition of Feudal Tenure, etc (Scotland) Act 2000}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/deleted/library/documents-w10/afs2-12.htm |work=Report on Abolition of Feudal System |title=Appendix A12: ''See Explanatory Notes on Clause 57 Subsection (2)'' |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041119234609/http://www.scotland.gov.uk/deleted/library/documents-w10/afs2-12.htm |archivedate=19 November 2004 }}</ref> However, the Abolition Act did end the ability to get feudal land privileges by inheriting or acquiring the ''caput'' (land or castle) in Scotland.  In [[common law]] jurisdictions, land may still be owned and inherited through a barony if the land is titled in \"the Baron of X\" as baron rather than in the individual's name.  In America, it passes with the barony as a [[fee simple]] appurtenance to an otherwise [[incorporeal hereditament]], the barony being treated like a landowning [[corporation]].<ref>{{cite court  |litigants=Re Notarial Instrument of the Earl of Galloway; Disposition; Warrant for Letters Patent |reporter=No.s 103, 104, 105, ''Palmyra Island Land Recordation'', United States District Court for the District of Hawaii |date=2017 |court=D.C. Hawaii-Palmyra I.}}</ref> In Scotland, the practice has not been tested in a [[Court of Session]] case since the Act.\n\nWhat is possibly the oldest barony in Scotland, the [[Clan MacLea|Barony of the Bachuil]], has not depended on land ownership for centuries; the barony passes along with the possession of a certain ancient stick, \"The Bachuil M\u00f3r\", which was once the bishop's staff of the [[Picts|Pictish]] [[Moluag|Saint Moluag]] in the year 562.  Unlike all other barons in Scotland, the lawful possessor of the stick is the Baron of the Bachuil, regardless of landholdings.<ref name=\"bachuil\">{{cite book |title=The MacLeas or Livingstones and their Allodial Barony of the Bachuil |first=Niall |last=Livingston of the Bachuil, yr. |publisher= Baronage Press |date=2006 |url=http://baronage.co.uk/2006a/Bachuil.pdf |access-date= 2018-05-21}}</ref>\n\nAfter 28 November 2004 under Scots law, a Scottish barony, which was previously Scottish heritable property (real property), became incorporeal heritable property (not attached to the land). Prior to the Act coming into effect, Scottish feudal baronies (including lordships and earldoms) were the only genuine title of UK nobility capable of being transferred following the sale of land containing a ''caput'' (or the sale of a feudal superiority).\n\nMost baronies were created (erected) prior to 1745, but one was erected as late as 1824. Since the Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000 came into effect, the [[Lord Lyon]], who is the Chief Herald of Scotland, has restored a more traditional form to the [[coat of arms]] of a baron. Barons are now identified by the helm befitting their degree. A new policy statement has been made by the Lord Lyon to this effect.\n\nIndependent Scots legal advice should always be taken before entering into any contract that claims to offer a baronial title for sale. The holder of the dignity of a barony may petition the Lord Lyon for a [[Grant of Arms|grant of arms]], as he falls under the jurisdiction of the [[Court of the Lord Lyon|Lyon's Court]]. A policy statement has been made to this effect by the Lord Lyon.<ref name=\"lyon-court.com\"/> The Lyon Court has no jurisdiction in relation to the transfer of, or legal \"trade\" in, feudal titles. Any prospective purchaser should seek specialist independent Scots [[Scots law|legal]] [[legal advice|advice]].\n\n==Usage==\nAn English barony is a [[peerage]] (yet the abolition act of 1660 allows for some remaining non-peer baronies not converted by writ to remain as feudal baronies of free socage \"incorporeal hereditament\" similar to a lordship of the manor), but whether Scottish barons rightfully rank as peers is disputable.<ref>{{cite web |author=Graham Senior-Milne, 41st Baron of Mordington  |date=27 June 2005  |url=http://www.peerage.org/genealogy/Baronies.htm |title=Scottish feudal baronies (feudal barons, feudal baron) including the oath of a knight}}</ref> They are known as minor barons currently treated as noble titles of less than peerage rank.  The Scottish equivalent of an English baron is \"[[List of Barons|Lord of Parliament]]\".\n\nThe feudal baronial title tends to be used when a landed family is not in possession of any United Kingdom peerage title of higher rank, subsequently granted, or has been created a knight of the [[realm]].  The name recorded by the [[Lord Lyon]] as part of any grant of arms or matriculation becomes the holder's name for all official purposes.\n\nThe holder of a Scottish barony (''e.g.'', \"Inverglen\") may add the title to his existing name (''e.g.'', \"John Smith, Baron of Inverglen\") or add the territorial designation to his surname if still in possession of the caput (\"John Smith of Inverglen, Baron of Inverglen\"); some of the oldest Scottish families prefer to be styled by the [[territorial designation]] alone (\"Smith of Inverglen\").<ref name=\"scotsbarons1\">{{cite web |url=http://www.scotsbarons.org/titles_and_usages.htm |title=Titles and Usages |publisher=Scotsbarons.org |accessdate=17 March 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150225165126/http://www.scotsbarons.org/titles_and_usages.htm |archivedate=25 February 2015  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.debretts.com/forms-of-address/titles/scottish--and-irish-titles/scottish-feudal-baronies.aspx |title=Scottish Feudal Baronies, Scottish and Irish Titles, Titles, Forms Of Address &#124; Debrett's |publisher=Debretts.com |accessdate=17 March 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130725234418/http://www.debretts.com/forms-of-address/titles/scottish--and-irish-titles/scottish-feudal-baronies.aspx |archivedate=25 July 2013  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.peerage.org/genealogy/Baronies.htm#Forms_of_address |title=Scottish feudal baronies (feudal barons, feudal baron) including the oath of a knight |publisher=Peerage.org |accessdate=17 March 2015}}</ref> Formal and in writing, they are styled as [[The Much Honoured]] Baron of Inverglen.

If accepted (and if the applicant wishes to include the title), the correct form is for the applicant to include the territorial designation as part of their surname (Surname of territorial designation e.g. ''Smith of Inverglen''). The Observation would then show the holder's full name, followed by their feudal title e.g. ''The holder is John Smith, Baron of Inverglen''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/118548/titles-included-in-passports.pdf |title=Titles included in passports |page=3 |publisher=UK government website}}</ref>\n\n==Scottish heraldry==\n[[File:ScotsBaronsHelm.JPG|thumb|A Scottish baron's [[Barons in Scotland#Helmet|helmet]]]]\nThe former Lord Lyon declined to award the following baronial additaments to the arms of those feudal barons registering arms now that the Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000 is in force.  However, the current Lord Lyon has confirmed in a recent policy statement that he will officially recognise feudal barons or those possessing the dignity of baron who meet certain conditions and will grant them arms with a helmet befitting their degree. Scottish Barons rank below Lords of Parliament; while noble, they are not conventionally considered peerage titles. Unlike others, the titles can be hereditary or bought and sold.\n\nIn showing that Scottish barons are titles of nobility, reference may be made, amongst others, to Lyon Court in the Petition of Maclean of Ardgour for a Birthbrieve by Interlocutor dated 26 February 1943 which \"Finds and Declares that the Minor Barons of Scotland are, and have both in this Nobiliary Court, and in the Court of Session, been recognised as 'titled' nobility, and that the estait of the Baronage (The Barones Minores) is of the ancient Feudal Nobility of Scotland\".\n\nSir Thomas Innes of Learney in his 'Scots Heraldry' (2nd Ed., p.&nbsp;88, note 1) states that 'The Act 1672, cap 47, specially qualifies the degrees thus: Nobles (i.e. peers, the term being here used in a restricted seventeenth-century English sense), Barons (i.e. Lairds of baronial fiefs and their \"heirs\", who, even if fiefless, are equivalent to heads of Continental baronial houses) and Gentlemen (apparently all other armigers).' Baronets and knights are evidently classed as 'Gentlemen' here and are of a lower degree than Barons. The Scottish Head of Baronial Houses, includes all the various styles and titles which designate the territorial nobility i.e. baron of X.\n\nBarons may also wear two eagle feathers when in traditional dress.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tartansauthority.com/highland-dress/modern/how-to-wear-the-kilt/some-advice/ |title=How to wear the kilt &#124; Scottish Tartans Authority |publisher=Tartansauthority.com |accessdate=17 March 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scotsbarons.org/hereditary_offices.htm |title=Hereditary offices |publisher=Scotsbarons.org |accessdate=17 March 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150226024221/http://www.scotsbarons.org/hereditary_offices.htm |archivedate=26 February 2015}}</ref> If the baron is a member of a clan, it is advisable to consult the clan chief on clan customs and traditions. The Lord Lyon only gives guidance and not governance on the wearing of feathers and recommends consulting with a clan chief.\n\n===Chapeau===\n[[File:Azure Chapeau.PNG|thumb|An azure [[chapeau]]]]\nPreviously, between the 1930s and 2004, when new arms were granted or a matriculation of existing arms took note of a barony, the owner was given a ''[[chapeau]]'' or [[cap of maintenance]] as part of his [[Coat of arms|armorial achievement]] on petitioning for the same. This chapeau is described as \"gules doubled ermine\" for barons in possession of the caput of the barony. An azure chapeau is appropriate for the heirs of ancient baronial families who are no longer owners of the estates. This chapeau was a relatively recent armorial invention of the late [[Lord Lyon]] [[Thomas Innes of Learney]].  Accordingly, a number of ancient arms of feudal barons do not display the chapeau, and now it is no longer granted.\n\nAt the [[Treaty of Perth]] in 1266, Norway relinquished its claim to the Hebrides and Man, and they became part of Scotland. In 1292, Argyll was created a shire and \"The Barons of all [[Argyll]] and the [[Lord of the Isles|Foreigners' Isles]]\", which had preceded the kingdom of Scotland, became eligible to attend the \"Scots\" Parliament&nbsp;\u2013 appearing in the record of the parliament at [[St Andrews|St. Andrews]] in 1309. Historically they have a chapeau, \"gules doubled ermines\", [[Ermine (heraldry)#Later variations|ermines]] being white tails on black.\n\nThere is a unique exception: the [[Bachuil|Barony of the Bachuil]] is not of feudal origin like other baronies but is [[Allodial title|allodial]] in that it predates (562 A.D.) Scotland itself and the feudal system, dating from the [[Gaels|Gaelic]] Kingdom of [[D\u00e1l Riata]]. In recognition as allodial ''Barons par la gr\u00e2ce de Dieu'' not barons by a [[feudal]] crown grant, the Baron of the Bachuil has the only chapeau allowed to have a [[vair]] ([[squirrel]] fur) lining.<ref name=\"bachuil\"/>\n\nA chapeau, if part of an armorial achievement, is placed into the space directly above the shield and below the helmet. It may otherwise be used on a [[visiting card]], the flap of an envelope, or to ensign the circlet of a crest badge as used on a bonnet.\n\n===Feudo-baronial mantle===\n[[File:Barony Robe and Chapeau.PNG|thumb|The historical Scottish baron's mantle and chapeau from the 1930s to 2004, which are no longer granted]]\nParticularly Scottish in character is the ''feudo-baronial mantle'' or robe of estate - described as gules doubled silk argent, fur-edged of miniver and collared in ermine, fastened on the right shoulder by five spherical buttons Or. This may be displayed in a [[Mantle and pavilion (heraldry)|pavilioned form]], draped behind the complete achievement of arms - or the armorial shield alone - tied open with cords and tassels, and surmounted by the chapeau. Again, Lord Lyon is no longer granting these heraldic mantles.\n\n===Helmet===\nThe ''helmet'' is now the chief mode of recognition of a Scottish baron.  The Lord Lyon has adopted a steel helm with grille of three grilles, garnished in gold, as the current baronial additament.  Alternatively, a feudal steel tilting helm garnished in gold, that may be shown affront\u00e9, may appear, or a helmet of some other degree if the baron holds a higher rank, such as a lordship of parliament.\n\n===Supporters===\n''[[Supporters]]'', are now usually reserved for the holders of the older baronies (chartered before 1587) and those that have been in continuous [[Family business|family ownership]]. In England, supporters are reserved for the peerage, and a Scottish baron who approaches the English [[College of Arms]] is not allowed supporters. A ''compartment'' has occasionally been granted to barons, representing their territories, even in cases where there are no supporters.\n\n===Badge===\nA ''badge'' \u2013 distinct from the ''crest'' \u2013 as a separate armorial device, is not necessarily a feature of the arms. The badge may be used by the \"tail\" or following of a landowner baron. The grant is linked to the baron's ''standard'', a heraldic flag, in the [[livery]] colours that carries a large representation of the badge. The standard is blazoned in the grant or matriculation. The livery colours are usually the two most prominent colours of the arms themselves.\n\n===Flags===\nA ''Standard'' \u2013 an elongated shape, tapering from 1.2 m down to 60&nbsp;cm, with the fly edge split and rounded (lanceolate). The length is according to rank, from 7.5 m for the Sovereign down to 3.5 m for a Knight, '''Baron''' or Chief. It bears the Arms as on the shield or the saltire in the hoist, with the tail parted per fess with the Crest, Badge and/or Supporter, plus the motto on one or more Ribands. The Standard is set before the '''Baron/Chief's''' tent (as it's a \"Headquarters\" flag and does not indicate that the Armiger is in residence) rather than carried like the banner. A Standard requires a separate grant by the Lord Lyon and is only made under certain conditions.\n\nA ''Guidon'' \u2013 one-third shorter than a Standard and tapering to a round, unsplit end at the fly. These are assigned by Lord Lyon to individuals who have Supporters to their Arms, and to others who have a following \u2013 those in a position of leadership or some official position.\n\nA ''Pennon'' \u2013 a smaller, elongated flag 4&nbsp;ft long with a pointed, rounded or swallow-tailed end, designed to be displayed on a lance, assigned by Lord Lyon King to an Armiger who applies for one. It is charged with the motto of the armiger as well as the arms as on the shield.\n\nA ''Banner'' \u2013 a square or rectangular upright representation of the Arms designed for carrying in warfare or tournaments, but now flown as a \"house flag\" when the Armiger is in residence and is NOT the flag of the Clan or Family.  Originally, conspicuous gallantry in battle was marked by cutting off the tail of the Standard or Pennon, turning it into a Banner. Strictly speaking, the sizes and shapes are:\n \n''Square banner'' \u2013 Sovereign, 1.5 m square; Dukes; 1.25 m sq; Earls, 1.1 m sq; Viscounts and Barons, 1 m sq; Baronets and '''feudal barons''', 0.9 m sq; other Armigers, 70&nbsp;cm wide x 85&nbsp;cm high\n \n''Rectangular banner'' \u2013 typically in the ratio 3:2, or 5:4 when flown as the \"house flag\" of an Armiger.\n \n''Carrying flag'' \u2013 this should be sized as follows (width x height): Peers, 1.2 m x 1.5 m; '''Feudal Barons''', 90&nbsp;cm x 115&nbsp;cm; Chiefs, 85&nbsp;cm x 110&nbsp;cm; Chieftains, 80&nbsp;cm x 90&nbsp;cm.\n\nA ''Ensign'' may be occasionally granted and blazoned. This is a square flag, smaller than the flying banner, and carrying the full embroidered achievement (arms, crest, motto), again fringed in livery colours.\n\nA ''Pipe banner'' \u2013 rather similar to a Banner, but of a size to fit on the longest drone of the pipes (usually 45&nbsp;cm) and richly decorated with gold fringing, tassles and the like. The pipe banner for a Chief who is also a Peer or a '''Feudal Baron''' should have a rounded end extending beyond the length, and any other Chief a split rounded end. A feudal baron is authorised two pipers.\n\n==List of Feudal Baronies (created before 1707)==\nBelow is a list of some Scottish feudal baronies created before 1707; this list does not include Scottish feudal baronies created between that year and 1838 (BGH), when the most recent creation of a Scottish feudal barony occurred.\n\n{{Expand list|date=January 2011}}\n:''When updating this list, please create for each new entry a separate, [[WP:Wikify|wikified]] article titled \"Scottish feudal barony of X\", which records a brief biography of the previous incumbent and is wikilinked to this list.

In the September 1976 column, he reviewed Conway's book ''[[On Numbers and Games]]'' and even managed to explain Conway's [[surreal numbers]].<ref>Martin Gardner, ''Penrose Tiles to Trapdoor Ciphers'', W. H. Freeman & Co., 1989, {{ISBN|0-7167-1987-8}}, Chapter 4. A non-technical overview; reprint of the 1976 Scientific American article.</ref> \n\nConway was probably the most important member of [[Martin Gardner#Martin Gardner's Mathematical Grapevine|Martin Gardner's Mathematical Grapevine]]. He regularly visited Gardner and often wrote him long letters summarizing his recreational research. In a 1976 visit, Gardner kept him for a week, pumping him for information on the [[Penrose tiling]]s which had just been announced. Conway had discovered many (if not most) of the major properties of the tilings.<ref>''[http://www.ams.org/notices/200506/fea-gardner.pdf Interview with Martin Gardner]'' [[Notices of the AMS]], Vol. 52, No. 6, June/July 2005, pp. 602\u2013611</ref> Gardner used these results when he introduced the world to Penrose tiles in his January 1977 column.<ref>[https://www.quantamagazine.org/john-conways-life-in-games-20150828/ A Life In Games: The Playful Genius of John Conway] by [[Siobhan Roberts]], [[Quanta Magazine]], 28 August 2015</ref> The cover of that issue of ''Scientific American'' features the Penrose tiles and is based on a sketch by Conway.<ref name=topten/>\n\nConferences called [[Gathering 4 Gardner]] are held every two years to celebrate the legacy of Martin Gardner, and Conway himself was often a featured speaker at these events, discussing various aspects of recreational mathematics.<ref>[http://gathering4gardner.org/VIDEOS.html Presentation Videos] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160809042801/http://gathering4gardner.org/VIDEOS.html |date=9 August 2016 }} from 2014 Gathering 4 Gardner</ref><ref name= bellos>Bellos, Alex (2008). ''[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2008/may/31/maths.science The science of fun]'' The Guardian, 30 May 2008</ref>\n\n==Major areas of research==\n\n===Combinatorial game theory===\nConway was widely known for his contributions to [[combinatorial game theory]] (CGT), a theory of [[partisan game]]s. This he developed with [[Elwyn Berlekamp]] and [[Richard K. Guy|Richard Guy]], and with them also co-authored the book ''[[Winning Ways for your Mathematical Plays]]''. He also wrote the book ''[[On Numbers and Games]]'' (''ONAG'') which lays out the mathematical foundations of CGT.\n\nHe was also one of the inventors of [[Sprouts (game)|sprouts]], as well as [[phutball|philosopher's football]]. He developed detailed analyses of many other games and puzzles, such as the [[Soma cube]], [[peg solitaire]], and [[Conway's soldiers]]. He came up with the [[angel problem]], which was solved in 2006.\n\nHe invented a new system of numbers, the [[surreal numbers]], which are closely related to certain games and have been the subject of a mathematical novelette by [[Donald Knuth]].<ref>[http://discovermagazine.com/1995/dec/infinityplusonea599 Infinity Plus One, and Other Surreal Numbers] by Polly Shulman, [[Discover Magazine]], 1 December 1995</ref> He also invented a nomenclature for exceedingly [[large number]]s, the [[Conway chained arrow notation]]. Much of this is discussed in the 0th part of ''ONAG''.\n\n===Geometry===\nIn the mid-1960s with [[Michael Guy (computer scientist)|Michael Guy]], Conway established that there are sixty-four [[uniform polychoron|convex uniform polychora]] excluding two infinite sets of prismatic forms. They discovered the [[grand antiprism]] in the process, the only [[non-Wythoffian]] uniform [[polychoron]].<ref>J. H. Conway, \"Four-dimensional Archimedean polytopes\", Proc. Colloquium on Convexity, Copenhagen 1965, Kobenhavns Univ. Mat. Institut (1967) 38\u201339.</ref> Conway has also suggested a system of notation dedicated to describing [[polyhedra]] called [[Conway polyhedron notation]].\n\nIn the theory of tessellations, he devised the [[Conway criterion]] which describes rules for deciding if a prototile will tile the plane.<ref name=rhoads>{{cite journal| doi=10.1016/j.cam.2004.05.002 | volume=174 | issue=2 | title=Planar tilings by polyominoes, polyhexes, and polyiamonds | year=2005 | journal=Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics | pages=329\u2013353 | last1 = Rhoads | first1 = Glenn C.| bibcode=2005JCoAM.174..329R }}</ref>\n\nHe investigated lattices in higher dimensions, and was the first to determine the symmetry group of the [[Leech lattice]].\n\n===Geometric topology===\nIn knot theory, Conway formulated a new variation of the [[Alexander polynomial]] and produced a new invariant now called the Conway polynomial.<ref>[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ConwayPolynomial.html Conway Polynomial] [[Wolfram MathWorld]]</ref> After lying dormant for more than a decade, this concept became central to work in the 1980s on the novel [[knot polynomial]]s.<ref>Livingston, Charles, Knot Theory (MAA Textbooks), 1993, {{ISBN|0883850273}}</ref> Conway further developed [[tangle theory]] and invented a system of notation for tabulating knots, nowadays known as [[Conway notation (knot theory)|Conway notation]], while correcting a number of errors in the 19th century knot tables and extending them to include all but four of the non-alternating primes with 11 crossings.<ref>Topology Proceedings 7 (1982) 118.</ref>\n\n===Group theory===\nHe was the primary author of the ''[[ATLAS of Finite Groups]]'' giving properties of many [[finite simple group]]s. Working with his colleagues Robert Curtis and [[Simon P. Norton]] he constructed the first concrete representations of some of the [[sporadic group]]s. More specifically, he discovered three sporadic groups based on the symmetry of the [[Leech lattice]], which have been designated the [[Conway groups]].<ref name=harris>Harris (2015)</ref> This work made him a key player in the successful [[classification of the finite simple groups]].\n\nBased on a 1978 observation by mathematician [[John McKay (mathematician)|John McKay]], Conway and Norton formulated the complex of conjectures known as [[monstrous moonshine]]. This subject, named by Conway, relates the [[monster group]] with [[elliptic modular function]]s, thus bridging two previously distinct areas of mathematics\u2014[[finite group]]s and [[complex function theory]]. Monstrous moonshine theory has now been revealed to also have deep connections to [[string theory]].<ref>[http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/M/Monstrous_Moonshine_conjecture.html Monstrous Moonshine conjecture] David Darling: Encyclopedia of Science</ref>\n\nConway introduced the [[Mathieu groupoid]], an extension of the [[Mathieu group M12|Mathieu group M<sub>12</sub>]] to 13 points.\n\n===Number theory===\nAs a graduate student, he proved one case of a [[Waring's problem|conjecture]] by [[Edward Waring]], that every integer could be written as the sum of 37 numbers each raised to the fifth power, though [[Chen Jingrun]] solved the problem independently before Conway's work could be published.<ref>[http://www.ems-ph.org/journals/newsletter/pdf/2005-09-57.pdf#page=34 Breakfast with John Horton Conway]</ref>\n\n===Algebra===\nConway has written textbooks and done original work in algebra, focusing particularly on [[quaternion]]s and [[octonion]]s.<ref>Conway and Smith (2003): \"Conway and Smith's book is a wonderful introduction to the normed division algebras: the real numbers, the complex numbers, the quaternions, and the octonions.\"</ref>  Together with [[Neil Sloane]], he invented the [[icosians]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/week20.html| title=This Week's Finds in Mathematical Physics (Week 20)| author=John Baez| date=2 October 1993}}</ref>\n\n===Analysis===\nHe invented a [[Conway base 13 function|base 13 function]] as a counterexample to the [[converse (logic)|converse]] of the [[intermediate value theorem]]: the function takes on every real value in each interval on the real line, so it has a [[Darboux property]] but is ''not'' [[continuous function|continuous]].\n\n===Algorithmics===\nFor calculating the day of the week, he invented the [[Doomsday algorithm]]. The algorithm is simple enough for anyone with basic arithmetic ability to do the calculations mentally. Conway could usually give the correct answer in under two seconds. To improve his speed, he practised his calendrical calculations on his computer, which was programmed to quiz him with random dates every time he logged on. One of his early books was on [[finite-state machine]]s.\n\n===Theoretical physics===\nIn 2004, Conway and [[Simon B. Kochen]], another Princeton mathematician, proved the [[free will theorem]], a startling version of the \"[[Hidden-variable theory|no hidden variables]]\" principle of [[quantum mechanics]]. It states that given certain conditions, if an experimenter can freely decide what quantities to measure in a particular experiment, then elementary particles must be free to choose their spins to make the measurements consistent with physical law. In Conway's provocative wording: \"if experimenters have [[free will]], then so do elementary particles.\"<ref>''[http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~jas/one/freewill-theorem.html Conway's Proof Of The Free Will Theorem] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171125154530/https://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~jas/one/freewill-theorem.html |date=25 Nov 2017 }}'' by Jasvir Nagra</ref>\n\n==Awards and honours==\nConway received the [[Berwick Prizes|Berwick Prize]] (1971),<ref name=\"LMS Prizewinners\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.lms.ac.uk/prizes/list-lms-prize-winners|title=List of LMS prize winners &#124; London Mathematical Society|website=www.lms.ac.uk}}</ref> was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] (1981),<ref name=royal/> was the first recipient of the [[P\u00f3lya Prize (LMS)]] (1987),<ref name=\"LMS Prizewinners\"/> won the [[Nemmers Prize in Mathematics]] (1998) and received the [[Leroy P.

Conway reminisces on his long friendship and collaboration with Martin Gardner.</ref> For instance, he discussed Conway's game of [[Sprouts (game)|Sprouts]] (Jul 1967), [[Hackenbush]] (Jan 1972), and his [[Angel problem|angel and devil problem]] (Feb 1974). In the September 1976 column, he reviewed Conway's book ''[[On Numbers and Games]]'' and even managed to explain Conway's [[surreal numbers]].<ref>Martin Gardner, ''Penrose Tiles to Trapdoor Ciphers'', W.

He regularly visited Gardner and often wrote him long letters summarizing his recreational research. In a 1976 visit, Gardner kept him for a week, pumping him for information on the [[Penrose tiling]]s which had just been announced. Conway had discovered many (if not most) of the major properties of the tilings.<ref>''[http://www.ams.org/notices/200506/fea-gardner.pdf Interview with Martin Gardner]'' [[Notices of the AMS]], Vol. 52, No. 6, June/July 2005, pp. 602\u2013611</ref> Gardner used these results when he introduced the world to Penrose tiles in his January 1977 column.<ref>[https://www.quantamagazine.org/john-conways-life-in-games-20150828/ A Life In Games: The Playful Genius of John Conway] by [[Siobhan Roberts]], [[Quanta Magazine]], 28 August 2015</ref> The cover of that issue of ''Scientific American'' features the Penrose tiles and is based on a sketch by Conway.<ref name=topten/>\n\nConferences called [[Gathering 4 Gardner]] are held every two years to celebrate the legacy of Martin Gardner, and Conway himself was often a featured speaker at these events, discussing various aspects of recreational mathematics.<ref>[http://gathering4gardner.org/VIDEOS.html Presentation Videos] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160809042801/http://gathering4gardner.org/VIDEOS.html |date=9 August 2016 }} from 2014 Gathering 4 Gardner</ref><ref name= bellos>Bellos, Alex (2008). ''[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2008/may/31/maths.science The science of fun]'' The Guardian, 30 May 2008</ref>\n\n==Major areas of research==\n\n===Combinatorial game theory===\nConway was widely known for his contributions to [[combinatorial game theory]] (CGT), a theory of [[partisan game]]s. This he developed with [[Elwyn Berlekamp]] and [[Richard K. Guy|Richard Guy]], and with them also co-authored the book ''[[Winning Ways for your Mathematical Plays]]''. He also wrote the book ''[[On Numbers and Games]]'' (''ONAG'') which lays out the mathematical foundations of CGT.\n\nHe was also one of the inventors of [[Sprouts (game)|sprouts]], as well as [[phutball|philosopher's football]]. He developed detailed analyses of many other games and puzzles, such as the [[Soma cube]], [[peg solitaire]], and [[Conway's soldiers]]. He came up with the [[angel problem]], which was solved in 2006.\n\nHe invented a new system of numbers, the [[surreal numbers]], which are closely related to certain games and have been the subject of a mathematical novelette by [[Donald Knuth]].<ref>[http://discovermagazine.com/1995/dec/infinityplusonea599 Infinity Plus One, and Other Surreal Numbers] by Polly Shulman, [[Discover Magazine]], 1 December 1995</ref> He also invented a nomenclature for exceedingly [[large number]]s, the [[Conway chained arrow notation]]. Much of this is discussed in the 0th part of ''ONAG''.\n\n===Geometry===\nIn the mid-1960s with [[Michael Guy (computer scientist)|Michael Guy]], Conway established that there are sixty-four [[uniform polychoron|convex uniform polychora]] excluding two infinite sets of prismatic forms. They discovered the [[grand antiprism]] in the process, the only [[non-Wythoffian]] uniform [[polychoron]].<ref>J. H. Conway, \"Four-dimensional Archimedean polytopes\", Proc. Colloquium on Convexity, Copenhagen 1965, Kobenhavns Univ. Mat. Institut (1967) 38\u201339.</ref> Conway has also suggested a system of notation dedicated to describing [[polyhedra]] called [[Conway polyhedron notation]].\n\nIn the theory of tessellations, he devised the [[Conway criterion]] which describes rules for deciding if a prototile will tile the plane.<ref name=rhoads>{{cite journal| doi=10.1016/j.cam.2004.05.002 | volume=174 | issue=2 | title=Planar tilings by polyominoes, polyhexes, and polyiamonds | year=2005 | journal=Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics | pages=329\u2013353 | last1 = Rhoads | first1 = Glenn C.| bibcode=2005JCoAM.174..329R }}</ref>\n\nHe investigated lattices in higher dimensions, and was the first to determine the symmetry group of the [[Leech lattice]].\n\n===Geometric topology===\nIn knot theory, Conway formulated a new variation of the [[Alexander polynomial]] and produced a new invariant now called the Conway polynomial.<ref>[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ConwayPolynomial.html Conway Polynomial] [[Wolfram MathWorld]]</ref> After lying dormant for more than a decade, this concept became central to work in the 1980s on the novel [[knot polynomial]]s.<ref>Livingston, Charles, Knot Theory (MAA Textbooks), 1993, {{ISBN|0883850273}}</ref> Conway further developed [[tangle theory]] and invented a system of notation for tabulating knots, nowadays known as [[Conway notation (knot theory)|Conway notation]], while correcting a number of errors in the 19th century knot tables and extending them to include all but four of the non-alternating primes with 11 crossings.<ref>Topology Proceedings 7 (1982) 118.</ref>\n\n===Group theory===\nHe was the primary author of the ''[[ATLAS of Finite Groups]]'' giving properties of many [[finite simple group]]s. Working with his colleagues Robert Curtis and [[Simon P. Norton]] he constructed the first concrete representations of some of the [[sporadic group]]s. More specifically, he discovered three sporadic groups based on the symmetry of the [[Leech lattice]], which have been designated the [[Conway groups]].<ref name=harris>Harris (2015)</ref> This work made him a key player in the successful [[classification of the finite simple groups]].\n\nBased on a 1978 observation by mathematician [[John McKay (mathematician)|John McKay]], Conway and Norton formulated the complex of conjectures known as [[monstrous moonshine]]. This subject, named by Conway, relates the [[monster group]] with [[elliptic modular function]]s, thus bridging two previously distinct areas of mathematics\u2014[[finite group]]s and [[complex function theory]]. Monstrous moonshine theory has now been revealed to also have deep connections to [[string theory]].<ref>[http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/M/Monstrous_Moonshine_conjecture.html Monstrous Moonshine conjecture] David Darling: Encyclopedia of Science</ref>\n\nConway introduced the [[Mathieu groupoid]], an extension of the [[Mathieu group M12|Mathieu group M<sub>12</sub>]] to 13 points.\n\n===Number theory===\nAs a graduate student, he proved one case of a [[Waring's problem|conjecture]] by [[Edward Waring]], that every integer could be written as the sum of 37 numbers each raised to the fifth power, though [[Chen Jingrun]] solved the problem independently before Conway's work could be published.<ref>[http://www.ems-ph.org/journals/newsletter/pdf/2005-09-57.pdf#page=34 Breakfast with John Horton Conway]</ref>\n\n===Algebra===\nConway has written textbooks and done original work in algebra, focusing particularly on [[quaternion]]s and [[octonion]]s.<ref>Conway and Smith (2003): \"Conway and Smith's book is a wonderful introduction to the normed division algebras: the real numbers, the complex numbers, the quaternions, and the octonions.\"</ref>  Together with [[Neil Sloane]], he invented the [[icosians]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/week20.html| title=This Week's Finds in Mathematical Physics (Week 20)| author=John Baez| date=2 October 1993}}</ref>\n\n===Analysis===\nHe invented a [[Conway base 13 function|base 13 function]] as a counterexample to the [[converse (logic)|converse]] of the [[intermediate value theorem]]: the function takes on every real value in each interval on the real line, so it has a [[Darboux property]] but is ''not'' [[continuous function|continuous]].\n\n===Algorithmics===\nFor calculating the day of the week, he invented the [[Doomsday algorithm]]. The algorithm is simple enough for anyone with basic arithmetic ability to do the calculations mentally. Conway could usually give the correct answer in under two seconds. To improve his speed, he practised his calendrical calculations on his computer, which was programmed to quiz him with random dates every time he logged on. One of his early books was on [[finite-state machine]]s.\n\n===Theoretical physics===\nIn 2004, Conway and [[Simon B. Kochen]], another Princeton mathematician, proved the [[free will theorem]], a startling version of the \"[[Hidden-variable theory|no hidden variables]]\" principle of [[quantum mechanics]]. It states that given certain conditions, if an experimenter can freely decide what quantities to measure in a particular experiment, then elementary particles must be free to choose their spins to make the measurements consistent with physical law. In Conway's provocative wording: \"if experimenters have [[free will]], then so do elementary particles.\"<ref>''[http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~jas/one/freewill-theorem.html Conway's Proof Of The Free Will Theorem] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171125154530/https://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~jas/one/freewill-theorem.html |date=25 Nov 2017 }}'' by Jasvir Nagra</ref>\n\n==Awards and honours==\nConway received the [[Berwick Prizes|Berwick Prize]] (1971),<ref name=\"LMS Prizewinners\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.lms.ac.uk/prizes/list-lms-prize-winners|title=List of LMS prize winners &#124; London Mathematical Society|website=www.lms.ac.uk}}</ref> was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] (1981),<ref name=royal/> was the first recipient of the [[P\u00f3lya Prize (LMS)]] (1987),<ref name=\"LMS Prizewinners\"/> won the [[Nemmers Prize in Mathematics]] (1998) and received the [[Leroy P.

The French planned to land 5,000-6,000 soldiers in North-East [[Scotland]] to support a rising by local [[Jacobitism|Jacobites]], that would restore [[James Francis Edward Stuart]] to the throne of Great Britain. \n\nDespite French commander [[Claude de Forbin]] warning the chances of evading the [[Royal Navy]] long enough to land his troops were extremely limited, his fleet of small [[privateers]] reached Scotland in March 1708. As he had forecast, he was unable to disembark the troops and returned home, narrowly escaping a pursuing British naval force.\n\nSuch attempts reflected a fundamental and continuing divergence of objectives; while the Stuarts wanted to regain their throne, for the French, they were a simple and low-cost way to absorb British resources. Much of the [[Royal Navy]] was occupied chasing de Forbin, while troops were diverted from Ireland and Southern England. This made it successful for France, but a failure for the Jacobites. \n\n==Background==\n{{Main|War of the Spanish Succession}}\n[[File:Claude de Forbin.jpg|thumb|left|French Admiral [[Claude de Forbin]] (1656-1733); he had little faith in the expedition from the start]]\nUnder the 1697 [[Treaty of Ryswick]], [[Louis XIV]] withdrew support from the exiled [[James II]], and recognised [[William III of England|William III]] as legitimate monarch. However, when James died on 16 September 1701, he reneged on this, and proclaimed his son [[James Francis Edward Stuart]] King of England and Scotland. The [[War of the Spanish Succession]] began soon after; William died in March 1702 and was succeeded by the last Stuart monarch, James' Protestant daughter [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Anne]].{{sfn|Williams|1960|p=340}}\n\nBy the end of 1707, the war had reached stalemate; despite victories in [[Flanders]], the Allies had been unable to break French border defences, or place their candidate on the Spanish throne. Both sides attempted to use internal conflicts to break the deadlock; Britain supported the [[Camisard|Camisard rebels]] in South-West France, with the Jacobites serving a similar function for the French.{{sfn|Owen|1938|p=238}}\n\nJacobite agent [[Nathaniel Hooke (Jacobite)|Nathaniel Hooke]] convinced Louis there was an opportunity for a Scottish rising, which would divert British troops from Europe. The [[Acts of Union 1707|1707 Act of Union]] was widely unpopular in Scotland, while French [[privateer]]s caused enormous losses for their maritime trade, and the coastal fishing industry.{{sfn|Whatley|2011|p=55}} Protecting Scottish shipping was not a priority for the [[Royal Navy]], which faced multiple demands on its resources for escorting merchant convoys.{{sfn|Journal of the House of Lords|1708|pp=405\u2013423}}\n\nHooke visited Scotland in 1707, meeting supporters like the [[Charles Hay, 13th Earl of Erroll|Earl of Erroll]], while elderly Jacobite [[Thomas Buchan]] provided reports on bases at [[Fort William, Highland|Fort William]] and [[Inverness]].{{sfn|Hopkins|2004}} Senior nobles like the Dukes of [[John_Murray,_1st_Duke_of_Atholl|Atholl]] and [[James Hamilton, 4th Duke of Hamilton|Hamilton]] refused to commit, partly due to an attempt in 1703 by [[Simon Fraser, 11th Lord Lovat|Simon Fraser, later Lord Lovat]], to implicate them in a Jacobite plot as part of a personal feud.{{sfn|Lord|2004|p=34}} However, Hooke obtained a letter of support signed by Erroll, the [[James Maule, 4th Earl of Panmure|Earl of Panmure]] and six others, promising 25,000 men, and requesting 8,000 French troops, weapons, money, artillery, ammunition and \u2018majors, lieutenants and serjeants to discipline\u2019 the Scots army.{{sfn|Sinclair-Stevenson|April 1971}}\n\nIn addition, supposed Jacobite Presbyterian [[John Ker]] claimed some [[Cameronian|radical Presbyterians or Cameronians]] supported the Stuarts since 'they are persuaded (Union) will bring an infinite number of calamities upon this nation, and render the Scots slaves to the English.'{{sfn|Sinclair-Stevenson|April 1971}} This was because they viewed union as a threat to Presbyterian [[Church of Scotland]], despite the [[Protestant Religion and Presbyterian Church Act 1707|Protestant Religion and Presbyterian Church Act]].{{sfn|Bowie|2003|p=229}} While the Cameronians were certainly considering this as an option, Ker was a government agent, whose role was to persuade them not to do so.{{sfn|Douglas|2008}}\n\nLouis decided there was enough support to begin planning in November 1707; this was supervised by the [[Louis Ph\u00e9lypeaux, comte de Pontchartrain|Comte de Pontchartrain]], who had been involved with previous attempts in 1692 and 1696. [[Claude de Forbin]] was appointed commander of the naval squadron, with the [[Charles-Auguste de Goyon|Comte de Gac\u00e9]] in charge of the landing force.{{sfn|Sinclair-Stevenson|April 1971}}\n\n==The Expedition==\n[[File:George Byng (1663-1733), 1st Viscount Torrington.jpg|thumb|right|British commander [[George Byng, 1st Viscount Torrington|Sir George Byng]] (1663-1733); ca 1700.]]\nAs the [[Royal Navy]] patrolled exits from the French Channel ports, naval operations often took place during the winter months, when wind and tides made it harder to enforce a blockade. However, it also increased risks from the weather; conditions off North-East Scotland were well-known to French privateers and de Forbin's biggest concern was lack of a confirmed landing place. He later recorded 'the Minister did not mention any port in a condition to receive us, ...or where our fleet might anchor and... troops disembark in safety.'{{sfn|Sinclair-Stevenson|April 1971}}\n\nBased on information supplied by French captains, de Forbin told Pontchartrain and Louis XIV the expedition had no chance of success, but planning continued. The fleet assembled at [[Dunkirk]], a major privateer base for centuries, since ships could reach the [[River Thames|Thames]] in a single tide, allowing them to reach as far north as the [[Orkney|Orkney Islands]].{{sfn|Bromley|1987|p=233}} By the end of February, 5,000 - 6,000 troops were ready to embark, joined by James himself on 9 March.{{sfn|Owen|1938|p=238}}\n\nRather than slow-moving transports, de Forbin insisted on using a larger number of small but fast privateers, many of which reduced their crews and offloaded guns to accommodate the troops. While this improved their chances of avoiding the Royal Navy, they could not hope to defeat them in a naval battle.{{sfn|Owen|1938|p=250}}\n\nThe British had been monitoring French preparations, and a squadron under [[George Byng, 1st Viscount Torrington|Sir George Byng]] now arrived off the nearby port of [[Gravelines]]. This prevented the French departure and since James was ill with measles, the troops were disembarked while he recovered. After a week, Byng returned to port for resupply; James and the soldiers were re-loaded, and on 17 March the French force of 30 privateers and five warships left Dunkirk.{{sfn|Lenman|1980|p=88}}\n[[File:Confiance Kent fight.jpg|thumb|left|Merchant ship (left), battling a much smaller [[privateer]] (right); these small but fast vessels formed the bulk of [[Claude de Forbin]]'s fleet]]\nAlthough their departure was immediately delayed by a two day gale, it forced Byng to take shelter, enabling the French to make for the [[Firth of Forth]]. Rather than following the coastline, de Forbin kept out to sea to avoid being spotted, and ended up north of the proposed landing site. On 25 March, the French anchored near [[Fife Ness]], then spent the next day searching for a landing place, allowing Byng to catch up with them. Despite James' protests, the French privateers could not face the British in battle and headed north; they then spent two days attempting to enter the [[Moray Firth]] before giving up. Most of them made it back to Dunkirk, despite being pursued by the British around the north of Scotland and west of Ireland, but sustained severe damage to both ships and men.{{sfn|Owen|1938|pp=255-263}}\n\nHearing news of the French fleet, some of the Jacobite gentry, including James Stirling of [[Keir House]] and four others, gathered at [[Brig o' Turk]]. They were arrested, imprisoned in [[Newgate Prison]] in London, then later transferred to [[Edinburgh Castle]] where they were tried for [[high treason]].{{sfn|Mitchell|1905|=87}} They were acquitted of this charge, as the evidence against them proved only that they had drunk to James' health.{{sfn|Cobbett|1719|p=1395}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nPerceptions of the expedition's value reflect a fundamental divergence of objectives between France and their Jacobite allies.

The French planned to land 5,000-6,000 soldiers in North-East [[Scotland]] to support a rising by local [[Jacobitism|Jacobites]], that would restore [[James Francis Edward Stuart]] to the throne of Great Britain. \n\nDespite French commander [[Claude de Forbin]] warning the chances of evading the [[Royal Navy]] long enough to land his troops were extremely limited, his fleet of small [[privateers]] reached Scotland in March 1708. As he had forecast, he was unable to disembark the troops and returned home, narrowly escaping a pursuing British naval force.\n\nSuch attempts reflected a fundamental and continuing divergence of objectives; while the Stuarts wanted to regain their throne, for the French, they were a simple and low-cost way to absorb British resources. Much of the [[Royal Navy]] was occupied chasing de Forbin, while troops were diverted from Ireland and Southern England. This made it successful for France, but a failure for the Jacobites. \n\n==Background==\n{{Main|War of the Spanish Succession}}\n[[File:Claude de Forbin.jpg|thumb|left|French Admiral [[Claude de Forbin]] (1656-1733); he had little faith in the expedition from the start]]\nUnder the 1697 [[Treaty of Ryswick]], [[Louis XIV]] withdrew support from the exiled [[James II]], and recognised [[William III of England|William III]] as legitimate monarch. However, when James died on 16 September 1701, he reneged on this, and proclaimed his son [[James Francis Edward Stuart]] King of England and Scotland. The [[War of the Spanish Succession]] began soon after; William died in March 1702 and was succeeded by the last Stuart monarch, James' Protestant daughter [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Anne]].{{sfn|Williams|1960|p=340}}\n\nBy the end of 1707, the war had reached stalemate; despite victories in [[Flanders]], the Allies had been unable to break French border defences, or place their candidate on the Spanish throne. Both sides attempted to use internal conflicts to break the deadlock; Britain supported the [[Camisard|Camisard rebels]] in South-West France, with the Jacobites serving a similar function for the French.{{sfn|Owen|1938|p=238}}\n\nJacobite agent [[Nathaniel Hooke (Jacobite)|Nathaniel Hooke]] convinced Louis there was an opportunity for a Scottish rising, which would divert British troops from Europe. The [[Acts of Union 1707|1707 Act of Union]] was widely unpopular in Scotland, while French [[privateer]]s caused enormous losses for their maritime trade, and the coastal fishing industry.{{sfn|Whatley|2011|p=55}} Protecting Scottish shipping was not a priority for the [[Royal Navy]], which faced multiple demands on its resources for escorting merchant convoys.{{sfn|Journal of the House of Lords|1708|pp=405\u2013423}}\n\nHooke visited Scotland in 1707, meeting supporters like the [[Charles Hay, 13th Earl of Erroll|Earl of Erroll]], while elderly Jacobite [[Thomas Buchan]] provided reports on bases at [[Fort William, Highland|Fort William]] and [[Inverness]].{{sfn|Hopkins|2004}} Senior nobles like the Dukes of [[John_Murray,_1st_Duke_of_Atholl|Atholl]] and [[James Hamilton, 4th Duke of Hamilton|Hamilton]] refused to commit, partly due to an attempt in 1703 by [[Simon Fraser, 11th Lord Lovat|Simon Fraser, later Lord Lovat]], to implicate them in a Jacobite plot as part of a personal feud.{{sfn|Lord|2004|p=34}} However, Hooke obtained a letter of support signed by Erroll, the [[James Maule, 4th Earl of Panmure|Earl of Panmure]] and six others, promising 25,000 men, and requesting 8,000 French troops, weapons, money, artillery, ammunition and \u2018majors, lieutenants and serjeants to discipline\u2019 the Scots army.{{sfn|Sinclair-Stevenson|April 1971}}\n\nIn addition, supposed Jacobite Presbyterian [[John Ker]] claimed some [[Cameronian|radical Presbyterians or Cameronians]] supported the Stuarts since 'they are persuaded (Union) will bring an infinite number of calamities upon this nation, and render the Scots slaves to the English.'{{sfn|Sinclair-Stevenson|April 1971}} This was because they viewed union as a threat to Presbyterian [[Church of Scotland]], despite the [[Protestant Religion and Presbyterian Church Act 1707|Protestant Religion and Presbyterian Church Act]].{{sfn|Bowie|2003|p=229}} While the Cameronians were certainly considering this as an option, Ker was a government agent, whose role was to persuade them not to do so.{{sfn|Douglas|2008}}\n\nLouis decided there was enough support to begin planning in November 1707; this was supervised by the [[Louis Ph\u00e9lypeaux, comte de Pontchartrain|Comte de Pontchartrain]], who had been involved with previous attempts in 1692 and 1696. [[Claude de Forbin]] was appointed commander of the naval squadron, with the [[Charles-Auguste de Goyon|Comte de Gac\u00e9]] in charge of the landing force.{{sfn|Sinclair-Stevenson|April 1971}}\n\n==The Expedition==\n[[File:George Byng (1663-1733), 1st Viscount Torrington.jpg|thumb|right|British commander [[George Byng, 1st Viscount Torrington|Sir George Byng]] (1663-1733); ca 1700.]]\nAs the [[Royal Navy]] patrolled exits from the French Channel ports, naval operations often took place during the winter months, when wind and tides made it harder to enforce a blockade. However, it also increased risks from the weather; conditions off North-East Scotland were well-known to French privateers and de Forbin's biggest concern was lack of a confirmed landing place. He later recorded 'the Minister did not mention any port in a condition to receive us, ...or where our fleet might anchor and... troops disembark in safety.'{{sfn|Sinclair-Stevenson|April 1971}}\n\nBased on information supplied by French captains, de Forbin told Pontchartrain and Louis XIV the expedition had no chance of success, but planning continued. The fleet assembled at [[Dunkirk]], a major privateer base for centuries, since ships could reach the [[River Thames|Thames]] in a single tide, allowing them to reach as far north as the [[Orkney|Orkney Islands]].{{sfn|Bromley|1987|p=233}} By the end of February, 5,000 - 6,000 troops were ready to embark, joined by James himself on 9 March.{{sfn|Owen|1938|p=238}}\n\nRather than slow-moving transports, de Forbin insisted on using a larger number of small but fast privateers, many of which reduced their crews and offloaded guns to accommodate the troops. While this improved their chances of avoiding the Royal Navy, they could not hope to defeat them in a naval battle.{{sfn|Owen|1938|p=250}}\n\nThe British had been monitoring French preparations, and a squadron under [[George Byng, 1st Viscount Torrington|Sir George Byng]] now arrived off the nearby port of [[Gravelines]]. This prevented the French departure and since James was ill with measles, the troops were disembarked while he recovered. After a week, Byng returned to port for resupply; James and the soldiers were re-loaded, and on 17 March the French force of 30 privateers and five warships left Dunkirk.{{sfn|Lenman|1980|p=88}}\n[[File:Confiance Kent fight.jpg|thumb|left|Merchant ship (left), battling a much smaller [[privateer]] (right); these small but fast vessels formed the bulk of [[Claude de Forbin]]'s fleet]]\nAlthough their departure was immediately delayed by a two day gale, it forced Byng to take shelter, enabling the French to make for the [[Firth of Forth]]. Rather than following the coastline, de Forbin kept out to sea to avoid being spotted, and ended up north of the proposed landing site. On 25 March, the French anchored near [[Fife Ness]], then spent the next day searching for a landing place, allowing Byng to catch up with them. Despite James' protests, the French privateers could not face the British in battle and headed north; they then spent two days attempting to enter the [[Moray Firth]] before giving up. Most of them made it back to Dunkirk, despite being pursued by the British around the north of Scotland and west of Ireland, but sustained severe damage to both ships and men.{{sfn|Owen|1938|pp=255-263}}\n\nHearing news of the French fleet, some of the Jacobite gentry, including James Stirling of [[Keir House]] and four others, gathered at [[Brig o' Turk]]. They were arrested, imprisoned in [[Newgate Prison]] in London, then later transferred to [[Edinburgh Castle]] where they were tried for [[high treason]].{{sfn|Mitchell|1905|=87}} They were acquitted of this charge, as the evidence against them proved only that they had drunk to James' health.{{sfn|Cobbett|1719|p=1395}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nPerceptions of the expedition's value reflect a fundamental divergence of objectives between France and their Jacobite allies. The Stuarts wanted to regain their throne; for the French, they were a useful, low-cost means of absorbing British resources but a Stuart restoration would not change the threat posed by British expansion.{{sfn|Macinnes |October 1984}}\n\nThe 1708 attempt was a response to the dire military situation France faced as a result of [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough|Marlborough's]] victories in [[Flanders]].{{sfn|Szechi|1994|p=56}} It occupied large elements of the British and Dutch navies for several months, with Byng ordered to remain in Scotland even after its defeat, while troops were diverted from Ireland and Southern England. A French army of 110,000 recaptured large parts of the [[Spanish Netherlands]], before defeat at [[Battle of Oudenarde|Oudenarde]] on 11 July evicted them once more.{{sfn|Owen|1938|pp=268-270}} \n\nDespite ultimate defeat, for France the expedition achieved its short-term purpose, but helped the pro-war [[Whigs (British political party)|Whigs]] win a majority in the May [[British general election, 1708|1708 General Election]], the first held after Union.

By incorporating these  biologically active compounds into experimental diets, it has been shown in feeding trials that they are distasteful to the [[sphinx blenny]] (''Blennius sphinx''), a [[List of feeding behaviours#By food type|polyphagous]] Mediterranean fish, while other sponges are readily eaten. Certain metabolic derivatives of these isoxazolines, such as [[dienone]] and [[aeroplysinin]], are not distasteful to the fish, but may have anti-microbial properties that protect the sponge from [[bacteria]]l [[pathogen]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Thoms, Carsten; Wolff, Matthias; Padmarkumar, K.; Ebel, Rainer; Proksch, Peter |year=2004 |title=Chemical Defense of Mediterranean Sponges ''Aplysina cavernicola'' and ''Aplysina aerophoba'' |journal=Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Naturforschung C |volume=59 |issue=1\u20132 |pages=113\u2013122 |doi=10.1515/znc-2004-1-222 |pmid=15018063 }}</ref> This sponge also bioaccumulates [[radionuclide]]s, and has been used as a [[model organism]] to study the presence of isotopes such as [[americium-241]] in seawater.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Maloubier, Melody; Michel, Herv\u00e9; Solari, Pier Lorenzo; Moisy, Philippe; Tribalat, Marie-Aude; Oberhaensli, Fran\u00e7ois R.; Bottein, Marie Yasmine Dechraoui; Thomas, Olivier P.; Monfort, Marguerite; Moulin, Christophe; Den Auwer, Christophe |year=2015 |title=Speciation of americium in seawater and accumulation in the marine sponge ''Aplysina cavernicola'' |journal=Dalton Transactions |volume=44 |issue=47 |pages=20584\u201320596 |doi=10.1039/C5DT02805A |pmid=26556307 }}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Commons category}}\n{{Wikispecies}}\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q1891651}}\n\n[[Category:Animals described in 1875]]\n[[Category:Verongimorpha]]\n", "name_user": "75.136.127.11", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aplysina_cavernicola"}
