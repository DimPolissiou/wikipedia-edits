The contour lines are drawn at 30-metre intervals.]]\n[[File:GoglandZ.jpg|thumb|right|One of the two points of the [[Struve Geodetic Arc]] that are situated on Hogland]]\n[[File:Pohjoiskorkia.jpg|thumb|right|North lighthouse on Hogland]]\n[[File:Suursaari.jpg|thumb|right|Hogland island visible on the horizon as seen from Haukkavuori observation tower in [[Kotka]]]]\n\n'''Gogland''' or '''Hogland''' ({{lang-ru|\u0413\u043e\u0433\u043b\u0430\u043d\u0434}}; {{lang-fi|Suursaari}}; {{lang-sv|Hogland}}, {{lang-et|Suursaar}}, {{lang-de|Hochland}}) is an [[island]] in the [[Gulf of Finland]] in the eastern [[Baltic Sea]], about 180&nbsp;km west from [[Saint Petersburg]] and 35&nbsp;km from the coast of [[Finland]] (near [[Kotka]]). Hogland has an area of approximately {{convert|21|km\u00b2|sqmi|abbr=on}}; its highest point is {{convert|173|m|ft|abbr=on}}. It belongs to [[Russia]]'s [[Kingiseppsky District]] in the [[Leningrad Oblast]].\n\nHogland's tourist industry is growing in importance, with most tourists coming from St. Petersburg, and some from Finland. In 2006, however, Russian authorities declared Hogland a \"border area\", which means that foreign nationals are not allowed to travel to the island without special permits. This limits tourism from abroad to small groups, admitted one at a time, and adds extensive bureaucracy to applications for permission to visit the island.{{cn|date=November 2019}}\n\n==Name==\nThere is some confusion regarding the transliteration of the name from the [[Russian language]]. The name Hogland has never actually changed; however, in Russian, the letter \"h\" is traditionally rendered as \"\u0433\" (\"g\") in older transliterations, thus the Russian name has always been \u0413\u043e\u0433\u043b\u0430\u043d\u0434, transliteration Gogland. Since being ceded to [[Russia]], the Russian name form, as seen on many maps, is often used in western languages.\n\n==History==\n{{see also|Hogland Series}}\nHogland has been inhabited by ethnic Finns since at least the 16th century, but it has changed hands several times. Throughout much of its history the island was part of the Kingdom of Sweden, which controlled Finland; however, after the [[Great Northern War]] (as part of which, the [[Action of 22 July 1713]] took place near the island),the Russian Empire, under Tsar [[Peter the Great|Peter I]], claimed the island. Peter then had the island's first lighthouse built in 1723.\n\nDuring the [[Russo-Swedish War (1788\u20131790)]] the [[Battle of Hogland]], between the [[Russian Navy|Russian]] and [[Swedish Navy|Swedish]] fleets, took place offshore, in July 1788.\n\nDuring the [[Baltic theatre of the Crimean War|Crimean War]], four vessels of the [[Royal Navy]] - [[HMS Arrogant (1848)|''Arrogant'']], [[HMS Cossack (1854)|''Cossack'']], [[HMS Magicienne (1849)|''Magicienne'']], and [[HMS Ruby (1854)|''Ruby'']] - silenced the Russian batteries at a fort on the island, while the Anglo-French fleet went on to attack [[Suomenlinna|Sveaborg]] before returning home.\n\nOffshore there have been several notable shipwrecks. The crew of the three-mast clipper \"Amerika\", which sank near the shore in October 1856, lie buried in an old Finnish [[cemetery]].\n\nAfter the [[Finnish War]] (1808 - 1809), Gogland officially passed to the [[Russian Empire]], although it was made part of the newly created [[Grand Duchy of Finland]] which gained independence from Russia in 1917. Most of the island's population lived in two fishing villages administrated from [[Vyborg|Viipuri]] (Vyborg).\n\nHogland is known as the location of one of the earliest [[radio]] contacts, which took place on February 6, 1900 under the supervision of [[Alexander Stepanovich Popov|Alexander Popov]]. (The time and details of this event vary slightly in different sources).\n\nTourism became an important source of income in the interbellum. There was also a small soft drink factory on the island.\n\nIn March 1939, the Soviets asked Finland to lease Suursaari and four small uninhabited islets for thirty years and cede rich and heavily populated areas on the Karelian isthmus, as they claimed they were vital for the defense of Leningrad, the second biggest Soviet city. In return, the Soviet Union would show its good faith by offering a large slice of empty and unofficially disputed Karelian borderland in exchange. The Finns refused.<ref name=\"William Trotter 1991 13\">{{cite book|author=William Trotter|title=A Frozen Hell: The Russo-Finnish Winter War of 1939-1940|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=yXsLNVaDfcoC|year=1991|publisher=Algonuin Books of Chapel Hill|page=13}}</ref>\n\nSoviet troops occupied the island during the [[Winter War]] (1939-1940), and the civilian population was evacuated. Hogland and nearby islands became strategically important during [[World War II]], as German and Finnish forces used them to observe and maintain the massive belts of sea mines that kept the Soviet fleet bottled up in the eastern Gulf of Finland throughout the conflict.\n\nFinnish forces captured Hogland during the [[Battle of Suursaari]] (Dec. 1941 - April 1942). Later, in September 1944 - Finland having ceased hostilities with the Soviet Union - the Germans attempted to take the island from their Finnish former allies, but were repulsed with heavy losses in [[Operation Tanne Ost]]. Hogland became a Soviet possession at the end of the war.\n\nIn 2019 Russia built a military [[heliport]] with room for multiple helicopters and a refuel station on the island.<ref>{{cite news  |title=Rysk nyhetsbyr\u00e5: Ryssland har byggt en stridshelikopterplatta p\u00e5 Hogland i Finska viken |url=https://www.hbl.fi/artikel/rysk-nyhetsbyra-ryssland-har-byggt-en-stridshelikopterplatta-pa-hogland-i-finska-viken/ |work=[[Hufvudstadsbladet]] |date=2019-08-07 |access-date=2020-02-18 |language=Swedish |trans-title=Russian News Agency: Russia has built a combat helicopter plate on Hogland in the Gulf of Finland }}</ref>\n\n===Landmarks===\nDuring the war years both Soviet and Finnish troops built extensive fortifications, which are still found all over the island, along with discarded military equipment.\n\nThe island has both modern and very old lighthouses.\n\nThe log village of Suurkyl\u00e4 (Russian: \u0421\u0443\u0440\u043a\u044e\u043b\u044f, ''Surkyulya'') has been leveled and replaced with a few modern dwellings, possibly for a Soviet fishing [[kolkhoz|collective farm]], as well as some military facilities.

Hogland has an area of approximately {{convert|21|km\u00b2|sqmi|abbr=on}}; its highest point is {{convert|173|m|ft|abbr=on}}. It belongs to [[Russia]]'s [[Kingiseppsky District]] in the [[Leningrad Oblast]].\n\nHogland's tourist industry is growing in importance, with most tourists coming from St. Petersburg, and some from Finland. In 2006, however, Russian authorities declared Hogland a \"border area\", which means that foreign nationals are not allowed to travel to the island without special permits. This limits tourism from abroad to small groups, admitted one at a time, and adds extensive bureaucracy to applications for permission to visit the island.{{cn|date=November 2019}}\n\n==Name==\nThere is some confusion regarding the transliteration of the name from the [[Russian language]]. The name Hogland has never actually changed; however, in Russian, the letter \"h\" is traditionally rendered as \"\u0433\" (\"g\") in older transliterations, thus the Russian name has always been \u0413\u043e\u0433\u043b\u0430\u043d\u0434, transliteration Gogland. Since being ceded to [[Russia]], the Russian name form, as seen on many maps, is often used in western languages.\n\n==History==\n{{see also|Hogland Series}}\nHogland has been inhabited by ethnic Finns since at least the 16th century, but it has changed hands several times. Throughout much of its history the island was part of the Kingdom of Sweden, which controlled Finland; however, after the [[Great Northern War]] (as part of which, the [[Action of 22 July 1713]] took place near the island),the Russian Empire, under Tsar [[Peter the Great|Peter I]], claimed the island. Peter then had the island's first lighthouse built in 1723.\n\nDuring the [[Russo-Swedish War (1788\u20131790)]] the [[Battle of Hogland]], between the [[Russian Navy|Russian]] and [[Swedish Navy|Swedish]] fleets, took place offshore, in July 1788.\n\nDuring the [[Baltic theatre of the Crimean War|Crimean War]], four vessels of the [[Royal Navy]] - [[HMS Arrogant (1848)|''Arrogant'']], [[HMS Cossack (1854)|''Cossack'']], [[HMS Magicienne (1849)|''Magicienne'']], and [[HMS Ruby (1854)|''Ruby'']] - silenced the Russian batteries at a fort on the island, while the Anglo-French fleet went on to attack [[Suomenlinna|Sveaborg]] before returning home.\n\nOffshore there have been several notable shipwrecks. The crew of the three-mast clipper \"Amerika\", which sank near the shore in October 1856, lie buried in an old Finnish [[cemetery]].\n\nAfter the [[Finnish War]] (1808 - 1809), Gogland officially passed to the [[Russian Empire]], although it was made part of the newly created [[Grand Duchy of Finland]] which gained independence from Russia in 1917. Most of the island's population lived in two fishing villages administrated from [[Vyborg|Viipuri]] (Vyborg).\n\nHogland is known as the location of one of the earliest [[radio]] contacts, which took place on February 6, 1900 under the supervision of [[Alexander Stepanovich Popov|Alexander Popov]]. (The time and details of this event vary slightly in different sources).\n\nTourism became an important source of income in the interbellum. There was also a small soft drink factory on the island.\n\nIn March 1939, the Soviets asked Finland to lease Suursaari and four small uninhabited islets for thirty years and cede rich and heavily populated areas on the Karelian isthmus, as they claimed they were vital for the defense of Leningrad, the second biggest Soviet city. In return, the Soviet Union would show its good faith by offering a large slice of empty and unofficially disputed Karelian borderland in exchange. The Finns refused.<ref name=\"William Trotter 1991 13\">{{cite book|author=William Trotter|title=A Frozen Hell: The Russo-Finnish Winter War of 1939-1940|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=yXsLNVaDfcoC|year=1991|publisher=Algonuin Books of Chapel Hill|page=13}}</ref>\n\nSoviet troops occupied the island during the [[Winter War]] (1939-1940), and the civilian population was evacuated.

He was also a writer on [[mysticism]], and a central figure in the group of devotees of [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophy]] which met in Dublin for many years.\n\n==Early life==\nRussell was born in William street [[Lurgan]], [[County Armagh]], (not as is sometimes   said  in  [[Portadown]]),  second son of Thomas Russell and Mary Armstrong.  His father, the son of a small farmer, became an employee of Thomas Bell and Co, a prosperous firm of  [[linen]] drapers.  The  family relocated to Dublin, where his father had a new offer of employment,  when George was eleven years old.  The death of his  much loved sister Mary, aged 18, was a blow from which it took him a long time to recover. He was educated at [[Rathmines]] School and the [[Metropolitan School of Art]], where he began a lifelong, if sometimes contentious, friendship with [[W. B. Yeats]].<ref name=\"boylan\">Boylan, Henry, ''A Dictionary of Irish Biography'', p. 384, 3rd. edit., (1998) {{ISBN|0-7171-2507-6}}</ref> In the 1880s, Russell lived at the [[Theosophical Society]] lodge at 3, Upper Ely Place, sharing rooms with H. M. Magee, the brother of [[William Kirkpatrick Magee]].<ref>David A. Ross, \"Eglinton, John\", in ''Critical Companion to William Butler Yeats: A Literary Reference to His Life'' (2009), [https://books.google.com/books?id=QxVvh5BHkloC&pg=PA461#v=onepage&q&f=false pp. 461-462]</ref>\n\nRussell started working as a [[draper]]'s clerk, then for many years worked for the [[Irish Agricultural Organisation Society]] (IAOS), an agricultural co-operative society initiated by [[Horace Plunkett]] in 1894. In 1897 Plunkett needed an able organiser and W. B. Yeats suggested Russell, who became Assistant Secretary of the IAOS.\n\n==Family==\nIn 1898 he married Violet North; they had two surviving  sons, Brian and Diarmuid, as well as a  third son who  died soon after  birth. [[Frank O'Connor]], who was  a close friend  of  Russell's in his  later years, remarked that his family life was  something of a mystery even to those who knew him best:  O'Connor noticed that he never spoke about  his wife and seemed to be at odds with his sons (although O'Connor himself  liked both of them).<ref>O'Connor, Frank  ''My Father's Son''  Pan Books Edition 1971 p.74</ref> While his marriage was rumoured to be unhappy, all his friends agreed that Violet's death in 1932  was a great blow to Russell.<ref>O'Connor p.104</ref>\n\n==Politician==\n[[File:George William Russel (AE) plaque, Dublin, Ireland.jpg|thumb|Plaque on 84 Merrion Square, where \u00c6 once worked (now 'Plunkett House')]]\nHe was an able lieutenant  to Plunkett, and travelled extensively throughout Ireland as a spokesman for the IAOS; he was mainly responsible for developing the credit societies and establishing [[Cooperative banking|Co-operative Bank]]s in the south and west of the country,  the numbers of which increased to 234 by 1910. Russell and Plunkett made a good team, with each gaining much from the association with the other.<ref>''AE and Sir Horace Plunkett'' J.J. Byrne (''The Shaping of Modern Ireland'' (1960) Conor-Cruise O'Brien) pp. 152\u2013157</ref> As an officer of the IAOS he could not express political opinions freely, but he made no secret of the fact that he considered himself a Nationalist. During the 1913 [[Dublin Lock-out]] he wrote an open letter to the ''Irish Times'' criticizing the attitude of the employers, then spoke on it in England and helped bring the crisis to an end.\n\nRussell definitely sympathized with the Easter Rising and saw it as in line with his views on Goidelic Nationalist \"traditional and natural communism\", but due to his personal leanings toward pacifism, his individual involvement took the form of editing and writing rather than direct participation in the significantly violent activities that took place. \n\n{{Quote box |width=300px |align=left |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=right\n |quote  =<poem>\nAnd yet my spirit rose in pride\nRefashioning in burnished  gold\nThe images of those who died\nOr were shut up in penal  cell\nHere's to you Pearse, your dream, not mine\nAnd yet the thought- for this you fell\nHas turned life's water into wine. \n</poem>\n |source = from ''To the memory of some I knew who are dead and loved Ireland'' (1917)}}\n{{clear}}\n\nHe was an independent delegate to the 1917\u201318 [[Irish Convention]] in which he opposed [[John Redmond]]'s compromise on [[Government of Ireland Act 1914|Home Rule]].<ref name=pit>''Irish Times'', 18 July 1935. p. 8</ref> He became involved in the anti-partition [[Irish Dominion League]] when Plunkett founded the body in 1919.\n\n==Publisher==\nRussell was editor from 1905 to 1923 of the ''[[Irish Homestead]]'', the journal of the IAOS. His gifts as a writer and publicist gained him a wide influence in the cause of agricultural co-operation.<ref name=\"boylan\"/> He then became editor of ''[[The Irish Statesman]]'', the paper of the Irish Dominion League, which merged with the ''Irish Homestead'', from 15 September 1923 until 12 April 1930. With the demise of this newspaper he was for the first time of his adult life without a job, and there were concerns that he could find himself in a state of poverty, as he had never earned very much money from his paintings or books. At one  point his son Diarmuid was reduced to selling his body to sailors in the Dublin docks for cash and tobacco, much to the annoyance of Russell, who accused Diarmuid, with whom his relations were not   good,  of \"wrecking his waste  basket\".<ref>O'Connor pp.74-5</ref>  Unbeknownst to him meetings and collections were organized and later that year at Plunkett House he was presented by Father T. Finlay with a cheque for \u00a3800. This enabled him to visit the United States the next year, where he was well received all over the country and his books sold in large numbers.<ref name=pit/>\n\nHe used the pseudonym \"AE\", or more properly, \"[[\u00c6]]\". This derived from an earlier ''[[anus eater]]'' signifying the lifelong quest of man, subsequently abbreviated.\n\n==Writer, artist, patron==\n[[Image:G W Russell Bathers.jpg|thumb|''Bathers'' by \u00c6 (1918)]]\nHis first book of poems, ''Homeward: Songs by the Way'' (1894), established him in what was known as the [[Irish Literary Revival]], where \u00c6 met the young [[James Joyce]] in 1902 and introduced him to other Irish literary figures, including William Butler Yeats. He appears as a character in the \"[[Scylla]] and [[Charybdis]]\" episode of Joyce's ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'', where he dismisses [[Stephen Dedalus|Stephen's]] theories on Shakespeare. Dedalus borrows money from him and then remarks: \"[[A.E.I.O.U.]]\" His collected poems was published in 1913, with a second edition in 1926. \n\nHe designed the famous [[Starry Plough (flag)]] for the [[Irish Citizen Army]] which was unveiled on the 5th April 1914 and flown during the Easter Rising. \n\nHis house at 17 [[Rathgar]] Avenue in Dublin became a meeting-place<ref>Described by [[Arnold Bax]] in his autobiography ''Farewell My Youth''.</ref> at the time for everyone interested in the economic and artistic future of Ireland: his Sunday evenings \"at home\" were a notable  feature of Dublin literary life.<ref name=\"boylan\"/>  [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]],  the effective leader of the new Government,  became acquainted  with Russell  in the last months of his life: [[Oliver St. John Gogarty]], a regular guest at Russell's  Sundays \"at home\" believed  that these two men, so utterly unalike in most ways, nonetheless developed a   deep mutual respect.<ref>Gogarty, Oliver St John  ''As I was going down Sackville Street''  Penguin edition 1954 pp. 183-4</ref>\n\nRussell's  generosity and hospitality were legendary: Frank O'Connor fondly recalled \"the warmth and kindness,  which enfolded you like an old fur coat\".<ref>O'Connor p.29</ref>  He was the most loyal of friends, and in the notoriously fractious Dublin literary world Russell  tried to keep the peace between his endlessly  quarrelling colleagues: even the abrasive [[Seamus O'Sullivan]]  could be forgiven a great deal, simply because \"Seamus drinks too much\".<ref>O'Connor p.77</ref>    His interests were wide-ranging; he became a [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophist]] and wrote extensively on politics and economics, while continuing to paint and write poetry.<ref name=\"boylan\"/> \u00c6 claimed to be a [[clairvoyant]], able to view various kinds of spiritual beings, which he illustrated in paintings and drawings.<ref name=\"boylan\"/>\n\nHe was noted for his exceptional kindness and generosity towards younger writers: [[Frank O'Connor]] termed him  \"the man who was the father to three generations of Irish writers\",<ref>O'Connor p.111</ref> and [[Patrick Kavanagh]] called him \"a great and holy man\". [[P. L. Travers]], famous as the creator of ''[[Mary Poppins (book series)|Mary Poppins]]'',  was yet another writer who gratefully  recalled Russell's help and encouragement. He features, scandalously, in Anthony Burgess' novel 'Earthly Powers' (Chapter 13)\n\n==Last years and death==\nRussell, who had become increasingly  unhappy in the [[Irish Free State]] (which according to Yeats  he called  \"a country given over to the Devil\"),<ref>O'Connor p.95</ref>  moved to England  soon after his wife's death in 1932.  Despite his failing health he went on a  final lecture tour in the [[United States]],  but returned  home utterly exhausted.  He  died of cancer in [[Bournemouth]] in 1935.<ref name=\"boylan\"/> His body was brought back to Ireland and he had an impressive funeral, which  was  attended by [[\u00c9amon de Valera]]  and many other leading figures in Irish public  life, Catholic<ref>In the 1940s and 1950s  Irish Catholics did not attend Protestant funerals.</ref> as well as Protestant.

Byrne (''The Shaping of Modern Ireland'' (1960) Conor-Cruise O'Brien) pp. 152\u2013157</ref> As an officer of the IAOS he could not express political opinions freely, but he made no secret of the fact that he considered himself a Nationalist. During the 1913 [[Dublin Lock-out]] he wrote an open letter to the ''Irish Times'' criticizing the attitude of the employers, then spoke on it in England and helped bring the crisis to an end.\n\nRussell definitely sympathized with the Easter Rising and saw it as in line with his views on Goidelic Nationalist \"traditional and natural communism\", but due to his personal leanings toward pacifism, his individual involvement took the form of editing and writing rather than direct participation in the significantly violent activities that took place. \n\n{{Quote box |width=300px |align=left |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=right\n |quote  =<poem>\nAnd yet my spirit rose in pride\nRefashioning in burnished  gold\nThe images of those who died\nOr were shut up in penal  cell\nHere's to you Pearse, your dream, not mine\nAnd yet the thought- for this you fell\nHas turned life's water into wine. \n</poem>\n |source = from ''To the memory of some I knew who are dead and loved Ireland'' (1917)}}\n{{clear}}\n\nHe was an independent delegate to the 1917\u201318 [[Irish Convention]] in which he opposed [[John Redmond]]'s compromise on [[Government of Ireland Act 1914|Home Rule]].<ref name=pit>''Irish Times'', 18 July 1935. p. 8</ref> He became involved in the anti-partition [[Irish Dominion League]] when Plunkett founded the body in 1919.\n\n==Publisher==\nRussell was editor from 1905 to 1923 of the ''[[Irish Homestead]]'', the journal of the IAOS. His gifts as a writer and publicist gained him a wide influence in the cause of agricultural co-operation.<ref name=\"boylan\"/> He then became editor of ''[[The Irish Statesman]]'', the paper of the Irish Dominion League, which merged with the ''Irish Homestead'', from 15 September 1923 until 12 April 1930. With the demise of this newspaper he was for the first time of his adult life without a job, and there were concerns that he could find himself in a state of poverty, as he had never earned very much money from his paintings or books. At one  point his son Diarmuid was reduced to selling off early drafts of his  father's works to raise money,  to the annoyance of Russell, who accused Diarmuid, with whom his relations were not   good,  of \"raiding the wastepaper baskets\".<ref>O'Connor pp.74-5</ref>  Unbeknownst to him meetings and collections were organized and later that year at Plunkett House he was presented by Father T. Finlay with a cheque for \u00a3800. This enabled him to visit the United States the next year, where he was well received all over the country and his books sold in large numbers.<ref name=pit/>\n\nHe used the pseudonym \"AE\", or more properly, \"[[\u00c6]]\". This derived from an earlier ''[[\u00c6on]]'' signifying the lifelong quest of man, subsequently abbreviated.\n\n==Writer, artist, patron==\n[[Image:G W Russell Bathers.jpg|thumb|''Bathers'' by \u00c6 (1918)]]\nHis first book of poems, ''Homeward: Songs by the Way'' (1894), established him in what was known as the [[Irish Literary Revival]], where \u00c6 met the young [[James Joyce]] in 1902 and introduced him to other Irish literary figures, including William Butler Yeats. He appears as a character in the \"[[Scylla]] and [[Charybdis]]\" episode of Joyce's ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'', where he dismisses [[Stephen Dedalus|Stephen's]] theories on Shakespeare. Dedalus borrows money from him and then remarks: \"[[A.E.I.O.U.]]\" His collected poems was published in 1913, with a second edition in 1926. \n\nHe designed the famous [[Starry Plough (flag)]] for the [[Irish Citizen Army]] which was unveiled on the 5th April 1914 and flown during the Easter Rising. \n\nHis house at 17 [[Rathgar]] Avenue in Dublin became a meeting-place<ref>Described by [[Arnold Bax]] in his autobiography ''Farewell My Youth''.</ref> at the time for everyone interested in the economic and artistic future of Ireland: his Sunday evenings \"at home\" were a notable  feature of Dublin literary life.<ref name=\"boylan\"/>  [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]],  the effective leader of the new Government,  became acquainted  with Russell  in the last months of his life: [[Oliver St. John Gogarty]], a regular guest at Russell's  Sundays \"at home\" believed  that these two men, so utterly unalike in most ways, nonetheless developed a   deep mutual respect.<ref>Gogarty, Oliver St John  ''As I was going down Sackville Street''  Penguin edition 1954 pp. 183-4</ref>\n\nRussell's  generosity and hospitality were legendary: Frank O'Connor fondly recalled \"the warmth and kindness,  which enfolded you like an old fur coat\".<ref>O'Connor p.29</ref>  He was the most loyal of friends, and in the notoriously fractious Dublin literary world Russell  tried to keep the peace between his endlessly  quarrelling colleagues: even the abrasive [[Seamus O'Sullivan]]  could be forgiven a great deal, simply because \"Seamus drinks too much\".<ref>O'Connor p.77</ref>    His interests were wide-ranging; he became a [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophist]] and wrote extensively on politics and economics, while continuing to paint and write poetry.<ref name=\"boylan\"/> \u00c6 claimed to be a [[clairvoyant]], able to view various kinds of spiritual beings, which he illustrated in paintings and drawings.<ref name=\"boylan\"/>\n\nHe was noted for his exceptional kindness and generosity towards younger writers: [[Frank O'Connor]] termed him  \"the man who was the father to three generations of Irish writers\",<ref>O'Connor p.111</ref> and [[Patrick Kavanagh]] called him \"a great and holy man\". [[P. L. Travers]], famous as the creator of ''[[Mary Poppins (book series)|Mary Poppins]]'',  was yet another writer who gratefully  recalled Russell's help and encouragement. He features, scandalously, in Anthony Burgess' novel 'Earthly Powers' (Chapter 13)\n\n==Last years and death==\nRussell, who had become increasingly  unhappy in the [[Irish Free State]] (which according to Yeats  he called  \"a country given over to the Devil\"),<ref>O'Connor p.95</ref>  moved to England  soon after his wife's death in 1932.  Despite his failing health he went on a  final lecture tour in the [[United States]],  but returned  home utterly exhausted.  He  died of cancer in [[Bournemouth]] in 1935.<ref name=\"boylan\"/> His body was brought back to Ireland and he had an impressive funeral, which  was  attended by [[\u00c9amon de Valera]]  and many other leading figures in Irish public  life, Catholic<ref>In the 1940s and 1950s  Irish Catholics did not attend Protestant funerals.</ref> as well as Protestant.

He held the position of editor-in-chief at ''Schw\u00e4bische Volkspresse'' (established 1921; from 1925 the ''Banat Deutsche Zeitung'') for several years, strengthening the voice of the Swabian-German community. In September 1923 Karl von M\u00f6ller actively participated in a celebration of the 200th anniversary of the migration of the Swabians organized by the Banat German Movement.\n\nIn autumn 1919 he was briefly Deputy Mayor of Timi\u0219oara, after which he was elected four times to the [[Parliament of Romania|Romanian Parliament]], in which he served between 1919 and 1927 as a representative of the Swabians in Banat. In the parliamentary debate on the [[1923 Constitution of Romania]] on March 12, 1923, he said he was speaking on behalf of the \"Banat Swabian People\", declaring the Germans' loyalty to their new homeland, but demanded that the new constitution should not jeopardize the existence of minorities from a national point of view; he said the new constitution did not include the promises made to the minorities by the Romanians in [[Union of Transylvania with Romania|Alba Iulia]].<ref>[http://www.uefromania.ro / evolution-German-from-banat-in-context-administrative-demographic-political-and-legislative-in-the-interwar period / Evolution of German education in Banat in administrative context , demographic, political and legislative in the interwar period]</ref>\n\nIn May 1920 the \"moderate\" Swabians, led by [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaspar_Muth Kaspar Muth], formed the Swabian Party of Autonomy, joined by Karl von M\u00f6ller, [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josef_Gabriel_(Politiker,_1880) Dr Joseph Gabriel], and Peter Schiff of the National Swabian-German party.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.muzeulbanatului.ro/istorie/publicatii/analele_banatului_2008/3_6_narai.pdf | title=Muzeulbanatului.ro }}{{Dead link|date=February 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nIn 1927, M\u00f6ller withdrew from public life and settled in [[Jimbolia]], where he married Margaret Jung, the daughter of a wealthy farmer from the Banat.

M\u00f6ller, who adhered to Nazi ideology, tried to use these positions to popularise Nazism and prepare the Banat population for its adoption. This attempt was thwarted, and he lost both positions by the end of 1931.\n\nAfter 1930, and especially after 1933, the Nazi movement had achieved a strong position in Romania, capturing the leadership of the Germans in Romania. The initiator of the Nazi movement among the German minority was the reserve captain [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fritz_Fabritius Fritz Fabritius]. From 1931, Fabritius tried to expand the movement in Banat, finding audiences in some circles of dissatisfied and young Swabians who returned from studies in Germany.

He held the position of editor-in-chief at ''Schw\u00e4bische Volkspresse'' (established 1921; from 1925 the ''Banat Deutsche Zeitung'') for several years, strengthening the voice of the Swabian-German community. In September 1923 Karl von M\u00f6ller actively participated in a celebration of the 200th anniversary of the migration of the Swabians organized by the Banat German Movement.\n\nIn autumn 1919 he was briefly Deputy Mayor of Timi\u0219oara, after which he was elected four times to the [[Parliament of Romania|Romanian Parliament]], in which he served between 1919 and 1927 as a representative of the Swabians in Banat. In the parliamentary debate on the [[1923 Constitution of Romania]] on March 12, 1923, he said he was speaking on behalf of the \"Banat Swabian People\", declaring the Germans' loyalty to their new homeland, but demanded that the new constitution should not jeopardize the existence of minorities from a national point of view; he said the new constitution did not include the promises made to the minorities by the Romanians in [[Union of Transylvania with Romania|Alba Iulia]].<ref>[http://www.uefromania.ro / evolution-German-from-banat-in-context-administrative-demographic-political-and-legislative-in-the-interwar period / Evolution of German education in Banat in administrative context , demographic, political and legislative in the interwar period]</ref>\n\nIn May 1920 the \"moderate\" Swabians, led by [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaspar_Muth Kaspar Muth], formed the Swabian Party of Autonomy, joined by Karl von M\u00f6ller, [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josef_Gabriel_(Politiker,_1880) Dr Joseph Gabriel], and Peter Schiff of the National Swabian-German party.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.muzeulbanatului.ro/istorie/publicatii/analele_banatului_2008/3_6_narai.pdf | title=Muzeulbanatului.ro }}{{Dead link|date=February 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nIn 1927, M\u00f6ller withdrew from public life and settled in [[Jimbolia]], where he married Margaret Jung, the daughter of a wealthy farmer from the Banat.

M\u00f6ller, who adhered to Nazi ideology, tried to use these positions to popularise Nazism and prepare the Banat population for its adoption. This attempt was thwarted, and he lost both positions by the end of 1931.\n\nAfter 1930, and especially after 1933, the Nazi movement had achieved a strong position in Romania, capturing the leadership of the Germans in Romania. The initiator of the Nazi movement among the German minority was the reserve captain [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fritz_Fabritius Fritz Fabritius]. From 1931, Fabritius tried to expand the movement in Banat, finding audiences in some circles of dissatisfied and young Swabians who returned from studies in Germany. At the end of 1931, Karl von M\u00f6ller constituted a movement group at Jimbolia and was proclaimed the \"Gauleiter\" for the Banat.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">= Aspects</ref>\n\nAfter Karl von M\u00f6ller became the first [[Gauleiter]] of the Banat, from July 1, 1932, he published the antisemitic newspaper \"Der St\u00fcrmer\" in Timi\u0219oara.

The tactic used was to take advantage of the early fielding restrictions by smashing the opening bowlers to all parts of the cricket ground, particularly by lofting their deliveries over the mandatory infielders, rather than the established tactic of building up momentum gradually. This was a novel but potentially match-winning tactic at that time, and Sri Lanka, who had previously never made it out of the preliminary rounds, went on to win the World Cup without a single defeat. Their new gameplan is now the standard opening batting strategy in limited-overs cricket for the modern era. [[Glenn McGrath]] cited Jayasuriya in his XI of toughest batsmen, noting \"it is always a massive compliment to someone to say they changed the game, and his storming innings in the 1996 World Cup changed everyone's thinking about how to start innings.\"<ref>[http://www.foxsports.com.au/story/0,8659,21636767-5012554,00.html McGrath's final fling \u2013 Cricket World Cup \u2013 Fox Sports<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nJayasuriya is known for both cuts and pulls along with his trademark shot, a lofted cut over point. He was one of the key players in Sri Lanka's victory in the 1996 Cricket World Cup, where he was adjudged Man of the Tournament in recognition of his all-around contributions.\nHis philosophy towards batting is summarized by an all-aggression approach and over the years he has dominated almost every one-day bowling combination that he has faced at one stage or another. This is because of his ability to make huge match-winning contributions at a rapid pace once he gets in, he holds the record for the second-highest number of one day centuries and has scored the second most 150+ scores (4 scores) ([[Sachin Tendulkar]] has the most 150+ scores at 5). His devastating performances have ensured that Sri Lanka has won almost 80% of the matches that he scored over 50 runs in limited-overs cricket. When asked in an interview who are the most challenging bowlers he had faced in the game, he named in the order [[Wasim Akram]], [[Shane Warne]], [[Glenn McGrath]], [[Courtney Walsh]], [[Curtly Ambrose]].\n[[Image:SanathJayasuriya.jpg|thumb|right|Known as Master Blaster, due to high-class match-winning devastating performances in ODIs]]\n\n===Bowling style===\n\nJayasuriya was a left-arm orthodox spin bowler known for quickly getting through his overs. Although a spinner, he was used to bowling faster balls and yorkers with quick arm action which gained him success as a bowler. He took 440 wickets altogether in international cricket with six 5 wicket hauls. His best bowling performance in an innings in international cricket is 6 for 29, which he took against England in an ODI in 1993. It was the best bowling performance by a Sri Lankan in ODIs until Muttiah Muralitharan broke the record in 2000. Jayasuriya's best match figures in test cricket came in 2001/2002 season when he took 9 for 74 against Zimbabwe.\n\nOne of Jayasuriya's memorable bowling performances came in the semi-final of 1996 Cricket World Cup, where he took 3 wickets for just 12 runs in seven overs. It was Jayasuriya who took the vital wicket of [[Sachin Tendulkar]] and broke his crucial partnership with [[Sanjay Manjrekar]], which was taking the game away from Sri Lankans at one stage. Jayasuriya was the most successful bowler for Sri Lanka during the knockout stage of 1996 cricket World Cup where he took 6 wickets in three games. As an all-rounder, he took 27 wickets in Cricket world cups altogether including 10 wickets he took in 2003 edition.\n\n===Test career===\n\nSanath Jayasuriya held the record for the highest Test score made by a Sri Lankan, 340 against India in 1997. This effort was part of a second-wicket [[partnership (cricket)|partnership]] with [[Roshan Mahanama]] that set the then all-time record for any partnership in Test history, with 576 runs. Both records were surpassed in July 2006 when fellow Sri Lankan [[Mahela Jayawardene]] scored 374 as part of a 624-run partnership with [[Kumar Sangakkara]] against South Africa. On 20 September 2005, during the Second Test of the [[Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06|home series against Bangladesh]], Jayasuriya became the first Sri Lankan to play 100 Tests, and the 33rd Test cricketer to achieve this feat.\n\nJayasuriya announced his intention to retire from Test cricket following the [[Pakistani cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06|Pakistan tour of Sri Lanka]] in April 2006. He reversed his decision soon after, however, joining the [[Sri Lankan cricket team in England in 2006|Sri Lankan cricket team]] in England in May 2006. Missing the first two Tests, Jayasuriya returned in the Third Test at [[Trent Bridge]].<ref>http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/engvsl/content/story/249041.html</ref>\n\nAfter scoring 78 runs on day three of the first Test against England in [[Kandy]] in 2007, he announced he was to retire from Test cricket<ref>[http://www.cricketworld.com/england_in_sri_lanka_2007/article/?aid=14028 Jayasuriya Confirms Test Retirement After Half-Century]</ref> at the end of the match. In that inning he hit six fours in one over against [[James Anderson (cricketer)|James Anderson]].\n\n===One day International Career===\n\n===2009\u20132010===\n{{see also|List of highest individual scores in ODIs}}\n\nJayasuriya held the records for the fastest fifty (against Pakistan 17 balls),  fastest 100 for Sri Lanka(against Pakistan 48 balls) and fastest 150 (against England in 95 balls) in ODI cricket. His fastest 50 stayed 19 years, where his half-century is regarded as the best because he achieved this feat in an era where no fielding restrictions and power plays are available. It took 19 years to surpass the fastest 50 with all limited over new restrictions and other fielding restrictions. However, he subsequently lost the fastest fifty to [[AB de Villiers]].  Jayasuriya and [[Sachin Tendulkar]] are the only players in history to have 4 ODI scores over 150, where Jayasuriya is the only player of the history to have scored two consecutive 150+ scores.\n\nJayasuriya's highest ODI score is 189 runs, scored against India in Sharjah in 2000. It remains the highest ODI score by a Sri Lankan, and at the time of the innings it was the third-highest{{Ref|1|Note 1}} in ODI history. Currently the score is 11th highest ODI score of all time and highest by a Sri Lankan.<ref>http://stats.cricinfo.com/ci/engine/records/batting/most_runs_innings.html?class=2;id=8;type=team</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; margin-left:1em; width:50%;\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"7\"|'''Jayasuriya's results in international matches'''<ref>{{cite web|title=Statistics / Statsguru / ST Jayasuriya /One-Day Internationals|url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/player/49209.html?class=2;template=results;type=batting|publisher=Cricinfo|accessdate=25 April 2012}}</ref>\n|-\n|&nbsp;||Matches||Won||Lost||Drawn||Tied||No result\n|-\n|Test<ref>{{cite web|title=List of Test victories|url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html?class=1;filter=advanced;orderby=matches;result=1;template=results;type=batting|publisher=Cricinfo|accessdate=25 April 2012}}</ref> ||110||40||35||35||0||\u2013\n|-\n|ODI<ref>{{cite web|title=List of ODI victories|url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html?class=2;filter=advanced;orderby=matches;result=1;template=results;type=batting|publisher=Cricinfo|accessdate=25 April 2012}}</ref> ||445||233||193||\u2013||3||16\n|-\n|T20I<ref>{{cite web|title=List of T20I victories|url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html?class=3;filter=advanced;orderby=matches;result=1;template=results;type=batting|publisher=Cricinfo|accessdate=25 April 2012}}</ref> ||31||19||12||\u2013||\u2013||\u2013\n|}\n\nJayasuriya was the previous record-holder for the fastest century (off 48 balls), before losing that to [[Shahid Afridi]]'s 37 ball century. This is cited as the first ever fastest century scored in less than 50 balls in world cricket. The record was then broken by [[Corey Anderson]] of New Zealand (36 balls), which is currently held by [[AB de Villiers]] of South Africa with 31 ball century. He has also held the world record for most ODI sixes (270 in 445 ODIs), which was surpassed by Shahid Afridi during the [[2010 Asia Cup]] match against Bangladesh. He became the fourth batsman to score more than 10,000 runs and the second batsman to score more than 12,000, and 13,000 runs in the history of ODIs. He also has 28 centuries, the fourth-highest in ODIs. He held the record of scoring most runs in an ODI over (30; he has achieved this twice), and the first batsman to score over 30 in an over. This record is now held by South Africa's [[Herschelle Gibbs]] (36 runs in an over).\n\nDuring the one-day Natwest series on May 2006 in England, he scored two centuries, including scoring 152 off 99 balls in the final match. In that innings, he and [[Upul Tharanga]] (109) put on 286 runs for the first wicket, a new record.<ref>http://usa.cricinfo.com/db/STATS/ODIS/PARTNERSHIPS/ODI_PARTNERSHIP_RECORDS.html one-day international record</ref> Jayasuriya's batting display earned him the Man of the Series award as Sri Lanka whitewashed England for the first time in their home soil by winning the series 5\u20130.\n\nFollowing the Natwest Trophy, Sri Lanka travelled to the [[Netherlands]] for a two-match one-day series. In the first game, Jayasuriya scored 157 off 104 balls as Sri Lanka posted 443/9,<ref>http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/247827.html highest team total in limited-overs cricket</ref> beating the 438/9 South Africa scored against Australia in March 2006. Sri Lanka won the match by 195 runs. On a personal note, the innings was his 4th score of over 150 in ODI cricket and he is currently the only player to do so other than [[Sachin Tendulkar]] who has achieved it five times. It was also his second successive score of 150 plus, another first in ODI cricket.\n\nHe also scored 2 centuries and 2 half-centuries in the [[2007 Cricket World Cup]] held in the West Indies. In 2008, his one-day career was all but over when he was omitted for the ODIs in the West Indies. However, a stirring performance in the IPL\u2014finishing the third-highest run-getter with 514 runs\u2014prompted his country's sports minister to intervene in his selection for the Asia Cup. He ultimately shaped Sri Lanka's title victory with a blistering hundred under pressure.<ref>http://stats.cricinfo.com/ipl/engine/records/batting/most_runs_career.html?id=3519;type=tournament</ref> His international career has been revived at the age of 41, after being recalled to the One-day and Twenty-20 squads for Sri Lanka's 2011 tour of England and Scotland.<ref>http://www.espncricinfo.com/england-v-sri-lanka-2011/content/story/518381.html</ref>\n\nDuring [[2008 Asia Cup]], Jayasuriya scored a century against Bangladesh on his 39th birthday.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/1100331.html |title=Birthday bullies, ODI oldies and poultry-laden Tests |publisher=ESPNcricinfo |accessdate=6 June 2017}}</ref> With this century, he became the third cricketer out of four overall, to score an ODI century on a birthday.

Jayasuriya led Sri Lanka to the knock-out stage of the [[2003 cricket world cup]] but stepped down from the captaincy after the loss to Australia in the semi-final. He was also a very useful [[all-rounder]] with a good [[batting average (cricket)|batting average]] in both Test cricket and One Day Internationals, and had an excellent batting strike rate in One Day Internationals.\n\nAs a [[left-arm orthodox spin|left-arm orthodox]] [[spin bowling|spin bowler]], he had a reasonable [[bowling average]] and an economy rate.

At the end of his career, Jayasuriya took more than 400 wickets in international cricket with over 300 wickets in One Day Internationals. Jayasuriya was also a skillful infielder, with a report prepared by [[Cricinfo]] in late 2005 showing that since the [[1999 Cricket World Cup]], he had effected the seventh highest number of run-outs in ODI cricket of any fieldsman, with the eleventh highest success rate.<ref>{{cite web| title = Statistics \u2013 Run outs in ODIs | last = Basevi| first = Trevor| url=http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/224487.html| date= 8 November 2005| accessdate = 2007-02-05| publisher= Cricinfo}}</ref>\n\n==Selection committee==\nJayasuriya was appointed as the chairman of selectors of national cricket team on 28 January 2013 by sports minister [[Mahindananda Aluthgamage]].

He has an elder brother, Chandana Jayasuriya. He was educated at [[St. Servatius' College]], Matara, where his cricketing talents were nourished by his school principal, G.L. Galappathy, and cricket coach, Lionel Wagasinghe. He excelled in cricket while at St. Servatius College, Matara and captained the college cricket team at the annual [[St. Thomas'\u2013St. Servatius Cricket Encounter]] in 1988. Jayasuriya was picked as the 'Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year' in the Outstation Segment in 1988. He also received the awards for the 'Best Batsman' and 'Best All-rounder' in the Outstation Segment at the Observer School Cricket Awards ceremony in the same year.<ref name=obser>{{cite news|last=Fernando|first=Leslie|title=Master-blaster Sanath won Observer Outstation Cricketer Award in 1988|url=http://www.sundayobserver.lk/2008/06/22/spo01.asp|accessdate=6 October 2012|newspaper=sunday observer|date=22 June 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090705161213/http://www.sundayobserver.lk/2008/06/22/spo01.asp|archivedate=5 July 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Jayasuriya represented [[Sri Lanka Under-19 cricket team|Sri Lanka]] in the inaugural [[ICC Under-19 Cricket World Cup]]  which was held in Australia in [[1988 ICC Under-19 Cricket World Cup|1988]] and was subsequently selected for a tour in Pakistan a few months later with the Sri Lanka 'B' team, where he made two unbeaten double centuries. Shortly afterward he was drafted into the national side for the tour to Australia in 1989\u201390.<ref>{{cite web|last=Thawfeeq|first=Sa'adi|title=Jayasuriya \u2013 the rural boy who made it to the big time|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/story/80876.html|publisher=ESPN CRICINFO|accessdate=6 October 2012}}</ref>\nHe made his [[One Day International]] debut against Australia at [[Melbourne Cricket Ground|Melbourne]] on [[Boxing Day]] of 1989 and his [[test cricket|Test]] debut against New Zealand at [[Seddon Park|Hamilton]] in February 1991.\n\n== Style and international career ==\n\n===Batting style===\n\nAlong with his opening partner [[Romesh Kaluwitharana]], Jayasuriya revolutionized One Day International batting with his aggressive tactics during the [[1996 Cricket World Cup]], a strategy they first tried on the preceding tour of Australia. The tactic used was to take advantage of the early fielding restrictions by smashing the opening bowlers to all parts of the cricket ground, particularly by lofting their deliveries over the mandatory infielders, rather than the established tactic of building up momentum gradually. This was a novel but potentially match-winning tactic at that time, and Sri Lanka, who had previously never made it out of the preliminary rounds, went on to win the World Cup without a single defeat. Their new gameplan is now the standard opening batting strategy in limited-overs cricket for the modern era. [[Glenn McGrath]] cited Jayasuriya in his XI of toughest batsmen, noting \"it is always a massive compliment to someone to say they changed the game, and his storming innings in the 1996 World Cup changed everyone's thinking about how to start innings.\"<ref>[http://www.foxsports.com.au/story/0,8659,21636767-5012554,00.html McGrath's final fling \u2013 Cricket World Cup \u2013 Fox Sports<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nJayasuriya is known for both cuts and pulls along with his trademark shot, a lofted cut over point. He was one of the key players in Sri Lanka's victory in the 1996 Cricket World Cup, where he was adjudged Man of the Tournament in recognition of his all-around contributions.\nHis philosophy towards batting is summarized by an all-aggression approach and over the years he has dominated almost every one-day bowling combination that he has faced at one stage or another. This is because of his ability to make huge match-winning contributions at a rapid pace once he gets in, he holds the record for the second-highest number of one day centuries and has scored the second most 150+ scores (4 scores) ([[Sachin Tendulkar]] has the most 150+ scores at 5). His devastating performances have ensured that Sri Lanka has won almost 80% of the matches that he scored over 50 runs in limited-overs cricket. When asked in an interview who are the most challenging bowlers he had faced in the game, he named in the order [[Wasim Akram]], [[Shane Warne]], [[Glenn McGrath]], [[Courtney Walsh]], [[Curtly Ambrose]].\n[[Image:SanathJayasuriya.jpg|thumb|right|Known as Master Blaster, due to high-class match-winning devastating performances in ODIs]]\n\n===Bowling style===\n\nJayasuriya was a left-arm orthodox spin bowler known for quickly getting through his overs. Although a spinner, he was used to bowling faster balls and yorkers with quick arm action which gained him success as a bowler. He took 440 wickets altogether in international cricket with six 5 wicket hauls. His best bowling performance in an innings in international cricket is 6 for 29, which he took against England in an ODI in 1993. It was the best bowling performance by a Sri Lankan in ODIs until Muttiah Muralitharan broke the record in 2000. Jayasuriya's best match figures in test cricket came in 2001/2002 season when he took 9 for 74 against Zimbabwe.\n\nOne of Jayasuriya's memorable bowling performances came in the semi-final of 1996 Cricket World Cup, where he took 3 wickets for just 12 runs in seven overs. It was Jayasuriya who took the vital wicket of [[Sachin Tendulkar]] and broke his crucial partnership with [[Sanjay Manjrekar]], which was taking the game away from Sri Lankans at one stage. Jayasuriya was the most successful bowler for Sri Lanka during the knockout stage of 1996 cricket World Cup where he took 6 wickets in three games. As an all-rounder, he took 27 wickets in Cricket world cups altogether including 10 wickets he took in 2003 edition.\n\n===Test career===\n\nSanath Jayasuriya held the record for the highest Test score made by a Sri Lankan, 340 against India in 1997. This effort was part of a second-wicket [[partnership (cricket)|partnership]] with [[Roshan Mahanama]] that set the then all-time record for any partnership in Test history, with 576 runs. Both records were surpassed in July 2006 when fellow Sri Lankan [[Mahela Jayawardene]] scored 374 as part of a 624-run partnership with [[Kumar Sangakkara]] against South Africa. On 20 September 2005, during the Second Test of the [[Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06|home series against Bangladesh]], Jayasuriya became the first Sri Lankan to play 100 Tests, and the 33rd Test cricketer to achieve this feat.\n\nJayasuriya announced his intention to retire from Test cricket following the [[Pakistani cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06|Pakistan tour of Sri Lanka]] in April 2006. He reversed his decision soon after, however, joining the [[Sri Lankan cricket team in England in 2006|Sri Lankan cricket team]] in England in May 2006. Missing the first two Tests, Jayasuriya returned in the Third Test at [[Trent Bridge]].<ref>http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/engvsl/content/story/249041.html</ref>\n\nAfter scoring 78 runs on day three of the first Test against England in [[Kandy]] in 2007, he announced he was to retire from Test cricket<ref>[http://www.cricketworld.com/england_in_sri_lanka_2007/article/?aid=14028 Jayasuriya Confirms Test Retirement After Half-Century]</ref> at the end of the match. In that inning he hit six fours in one over against [[James Anderson (cricketer)|James Anderson]].\n\n===One day International Career===\n\n===2009\u20132010===\n{{see also|List of highest individual scores in ODIs}}\n\nJayasuriya held the records for the fastest fifty (against Pakistan 17 balls),  fastest 100 for Sri Lanka(against Pakistan 48 balls) and fastest 150 (against England in 95 balls) in ODI cricket. His fastest 50 stayed 19 years, where his half-century is regarded as the best because he achieved this feat in an era where no fielding restrictions and power plays are available. It took 19 years to surpass the fastest 50 with all limited over new restrictions and other fielding restrictions. However, he subsequently lost the fastest fifty to [[AB de Villiers]].  Jayasuriya and [[Sachin Tendulkar]] are the only players in history to have 4 ODI scores over 150, where Jayasuriya is the only player of the history to have scored two consecutive 150+ scores.\n\nJayasuriya's highest ODI score is 189 runs, scored against India in Sharjah in 2000. It remains the highest ODI score by a Sri Lankan, and at the time of the innings it was the third-highest{{Ref|1|Note 1}} in ODI history. Currently the score is 11th highest ODI score of all time and highest by a Sri Lankan.<ref>http://stats.cricinfo.com/ci/engine/records/batting/most_runs_innings.html?class=2;id=8;type=team</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; margin-left:1em; width:50%;\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"7\"|'''Jayasuriya's results in international matches'''<ref>{{cite web|title=Statistics / Statsguru / ST Jayasuriya /One-Day Internationals|url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/player/49209.html?class=2;template=results;type=batting|publisher=Cricinfo|accessdate=25 April 2012}}</ref>\n|-\n|&nbsp;||Matches||Won||Lost||Drawn||Tied||No result\n|-\n|Test<ref>{{cite web|title=List of Test victories|url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html?class=1;filter=advanced;orderby=matches;result=1;template=results;type=batting|publisher=Cricinfo|accessdate=25 April 2012}}</ref> ||110||40||35||35||0||\u2013\n|-\n|ODI<ref>{{cite web|title=List of ODI victories|url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html?class=2;filter=advanced;orderby=matches;result=1;template=results;type=batting|publisher=Cricinfo|accessdate=25 April 2012}}</ref> ||445||233||193||\u2013||3||16\n|-\n|T20I<ref>{{cite web|title=List of T20I victories|url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html?class=3;filter=advanced;orderby=matches;result=1;template=results;type=batting|publisher=Cricinfo|accessdate=25 April 2012}}</ref> ||31||19||12||\u2013||\u2013||\u2013\n|}\n\nJayasuriya was the previous record-holder for the fastest century (off 48 balls), before losing that to [[Shahid Afridi]]'s 37 ball century. This is cited as the first ever fastest century scored in less than 50 balls in world cricket. The record was then broken by [[Corey Anderson]] of New Zealand (36 balls), which is currently held by [[AB de Villiers]] of South Africa with 31 ball century. He has also held the world record for most ODI sixes (270 in 445 ODIs), which was surpassed by Shahid Afridi during the [[2010 Asia Cup]] match against Bangladesh. He became the fourth batsman to score more than 10,000 runs and the second batsman to score more than 12,000, and 13,000 runs in the history of ODIs. He also has 28 centuries, the fourth-highest in ODIs. He held the record of scoring most runs in an ODI over (30; he has achieved this twice), and the first batsman to score over 30 in an over. This record is now held by South Africa's [[Herschelle Gibbs]] (36 runs in an over).\n\nDuring the one-day Natwest series on May 2006 in England, he scored two centuries, including scoring 152 off 99 balls in the final match. In that innings, he and [[Upul Tharanga]] (109) put on 286 runs for the first wicket, a new record.<ref>http://usa.cricinfo.com/db/STATS/ODIS/PARTNERSHIPS/ODI_PARTNERSHIP_RECORDS.html one-day international record</ref> Jayasuriya's batting display earned him the Man of the Series award as Sri Lanka whitewashed England for the first time in their home soil by winning the series 5\u20130.\n\nFollowing the Natwest Trophy, Sri Lanka travelled to the [[Netherlands]] for a two-match one-day series. In the first game, Jayasuriya scored 157 off 104 balls as Sri Lanka posted 443/9,<ref>http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/247827.html highest team total in limited-overs cricket</ref> beating the 438/9 South Africa scored against Australia in March 2006. Sri Lanka won the match by 195 runs. On a personal note, the innings was his 4th score of over 150 in ODI cricket and he is currently the only player to do so other than [[Sachin Tendulkar]] who has achieved it five times. It was also his second successive score of 150 plus, another first in ODI cricket.\n\nHe also scored 2 centuries and 2 half-centuries in the [[2007 Cricket World Cup]] held in the West Indies. In 2008, his one-day career was all but over when he was omitted for the ODIs in the West Indies. However, a stirring performance in the IPL\u2014finishing the third-highest run-getter with 514 runs\u2014prompted his country's sports minister to intervene in his selection for the Asia Cup.

The monsoon rains flooded the gates of the lake in December 2005 due to which the TTDC boat club operation has been stopped.

Kolavai Lake is well known for its perennial nature: There are records of going dry in summers. It even supplies water to industries in Chennai when the lakes in Chennai go dry. The lake is now being polluted due to the rapid urbanisation of Chengalpattu. The early morning sunrise and the moon hovering above the lake over its waters in the night are scenic to the eyes. The lake's beauty can be experienced by taking a train from the Chengalpattu station to Paranur.\n\n==Industry==\nThere are several modern industries around Chengalpattu, due to the town's proximity to Chennai and its frequent connectivity to other places through rail and road.\n\nSeveral companies in and around the town like [[Al-Ohm Inc.]], [[Tech Mahindra]], [[Wipro]], [[BMW]], [[Ford]], [[Flextronics]], [[Foxconn]], [[Dell]], [[Samsung]], [[Infosys]], [[Pepsi]], [[TVS Group|TVS]], [[Siemens]], [[Renault Nissan Automotive India Private Limited|Nissan Renault]], [[Apollo Tyres]], [[Mahindra Group|Mahindra]], [[Medopharm Pvt Ltd]], R & D, Bay forge have production plants near Chengalpattu.

The monsoon rains flooded the gates of the lake in December 2005 due to which the TTDC boat club operation has been stopped. It also serves as a bridge connecting all nearby districts with the renowned tourist places like [[Mahabalipuram]], [[Muttukadu boat house|Muttukadu]], theme parks on [[East Coast Road]] (ECR), [[Thirukazhukundram]], and [[Kanchipuram]].\n\n== Kolavai Lake ==\n[[Kolavai Lake]] is the second largest lake in the Chengalpattu District after Madhuranthagam Lake. Kolavai Lake is well known for its perennial nature: There are records of going dry in summers. It even supplies water to industries in Chennai when the lakes in Chennai go dry. The lake is now being polluted due to the rapid urbanisation of Chengalpattu. The early morning sunrise and the moon hovering above the lake over its waters in the night are scenic to the eyes. The lake's beauty can be experienced by taking a train from the Chengalpattu station to Paranur.\n\n==Industry==\nThere are several modern industries around Chengalpattu, due to the town's proximity to Chennai and its frequent connectivity to other places through rail and road.\n\nSeveral companies in and around the town like [[Al-Ohm Inc.]], [[Tech Mahindra]], [[Wipro]], [[BMW]], [[Ford]], [[Flextronics]], [[Foxconn]], [[Dell]], [[Samsung]], [[Infosys]], [[Pepsi]], [[TVS Group|TVS]], [[Siemens]], [[Renault Nissan Automotive India Private Limited|Nissan Renault]], [[Apollo Tyres]], [[Mahindra Group|Mahindra]], [[Medopharm Pvt Ltd]], R & D, Bay forge have production plants near Chengalpattu.

A hologram is a photographic recording of a [[light field]], rather than an [[image]] formed by a [[Lens (optics)|lens]]. The holographic medium, i.e., the object produced by a holographic process (which itself may be referred to as a hologram) is usually unintelligible when viewed under [[Diffuse reflection|diffuse ambient light]]. It is an encoding of the light field as an [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]] pattern of variations in the [[opacity (optics)|opacity]], [[density]], or surface profile of the photographic medium. When suitably lit, the interference pattern [[Diffraction|diffracts]] the light into an accurate reproduction of the original light field, and the objects that were in it exhibit visual [[Depth perception|depth cues]] such as [[parallax]] and [[perspective (visual)|perspective]] that change realistically with the relative position of the observer. That is, the view of the image from different angles represents the subject viewed from similar angles. In this sense, holograms do not simply produce the illusion of depth but are truly three-dimensional images.\n\nIn its pure form, holography requires the use of [[laser]] light for illuminating the subject and for viewing the finished hologram. A [[Microscopic scale|microscopic]] level of detail throughout the recorded scene can be reproduced. In common practice, however, major image quality compromises are made to eliminate the need for laser illumination to view the hologram, and in some cases, to make it. Holographic portraiture often resorts to a non-holographic intermediate imaging procedure, to avoid the hazardous high-powered [[Laser#Pulsed operation|pulsed lasers]] otherwise needed to optically \"freeze\" moving subjects as perfectly as the extremely motion-intolerant holographic recording process requires. Holograms can now also be entirely computer-generated to show objects or scenes that never existed.\n\nHolography is distinct from [[lenticular lens|lenticular]] and other earlier [[autostereoscopy|autostereoscopic]] 3D display technologies, which can produce superficially similar results but are based on conventional lens imaging. Images requiring the aid of [[Stereoscopy|special glasses or other intermediate optics]], stage illusions such as [[Pepper's Ghost]] and other unusual, baffling, or seemingly magical images are often incorrectly called holograms.\n\nIt was invented by Dennis Gabor in 1948.\n\n==Overview and history==\nThe [[Magyars|Hungarian]]-[[British people|British]] physicist [[Dennis Gabor]] (in Hungarian: ''G\u00e1bor D\u00e9nes'')<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Gabor | first1 = Dennis | authorlink = Dennis Gabor | year = 1948 | title = A new microscopic principle | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 161 | issue = 4098| pages = 777\u20138 | doi=10.1038/161777a0|bibcode = 1948Natur.161..777G | pmid=18860291}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|doi = 10.1098/rspa.1949.0075|first = Dennis|last = Gabor|year = 1949|title = Microscopy by reconstructed wavefronts|journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society|volume = 197|pages = 454\u2013487|issue = 1051|bibcode = 1949RSPSA.197..454G }}</ref> was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 1971 \"for his invention and development of the holographic method\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1971/ |title=The Nobel Prize in Physics 1971 |publisher=Nobelprize.org |accessdate=2012-04-21}}</ref>\nHis work, done in the late 1940s, was built on pioneering work in the field of X-ray microscopy by other scientists including [[Mieczys\u0142aw Wolfke]] in 1920 and [[William Lawrence Bragg]] in 1939.<ref>Hariharan, (1996), Section 1.2, p4-5</ref> The discovery was an unexpected result of research into improving [[electron microscope]]s at the [[British Thomson-Houston]] (BTH) Company in [[Rugby, Warwickshire|Rugby]], England, and the company filed a patent in December 1947 (patent GB685286).

The object in the hologram is a toy van. It is no more possible to discern the subject of a hologram from this pattern than it is to identify what music has been recorded by looking at a [[compact disc|CD]] surface. Note that the hologram is described by the [[speckle pattern]], rather than the \"wavy\" line pattern.]]\n\nHolography is a technique that enables a light field (which is generally the result of a light source scattered off objects) to be recorded and later reconstructed when the original light field is no longer present, due to the absence of the original objects.<ref>Hariharan, (2002), Section 1, p1</ref> Holography can be thought of as somewhat similar to [[sound recording]], whereby a sound field created by vibrating matter like [[musical instrument]]s or [[vocal cords]], is encoded in such a way that it can be reproduced later, without the presence of the original vibrating matter. However, it is even more similar to [[Ambisonics|Ambisonic]] sound recording in which any listening angle of a sound field can be reproduced in the reproduction.\n\n===Laser===\nIn laser holography, the hologram is recorded using a source of [[laser]] light, which is very pure in its color and orderly in its composition. Various setups may be used, and several types of holograms can be made, but all involve the interaction of light coming from different directions and producing a microscopic interference pattern which a [[photographic plate|plate]], film, or other medium [[photography|photographically]] records.\n\nIn one common arrangement, the laser beam is split into two, one known as the [[signal beam|object beam]]<!-- the traditional term, despite the redirect that results --> and the other as the [[reference beam]]. The object beam is expanded by passing it through a lens and used to illuminate the subject. The recording medium is located where this light, after being reflected or scattered by the subject, will strike it. The edges of the medium will ultimately serve as a window through which the subject is seen, so its location is chosen with that in mind. The reference beam is expanded and made to shine directly on the medium, where it interacts with the light coming from the subject to create the desired interference pattern.\n\nLike conventional photography, holography requires an appropriate [[Exposure (photography)|exposure]] time to correctly affect the recording medium. Unlike conventional photography, during the exposure the light source, the optical elements, the recording medium, and the subject must all remain perfectly motionless relative to each other, to within about a quarter of the wavelength of the light, or the interference pattern will be blurred and the hologram spoiled. With living subjects and some unstable materials, that is only possible if a very intense and extremely brief pulse of laser light is used, a hazardous procedure which is rare and rarely done outside of scientific and industrial laboratory settings. Exposures lasting several seconds to several minutes, using a much lower-powered continuously operating laser, are typical.\n\n===Apparatus===\n\nA hologram can be made by shining part of the light beam directly into the recording medium, and the other part onto the object in such a way that some of the scattered light falls onto the recording medium. A more flexible arrangement for recording a hologram requires the laser beam to be aimed through a series of elements that change it in different ways. The first element is a [[beam splitter]] that divides the beam into two identical beams, each aimed in different directions:\n* One beam (known as the ''illumination'' or ''object beam'') is spread using [[Lens (optics)|lenses]] and directed onto the scene using [[mirror]]s. Some of the light scattered (reflected) from the scene then falls onto the recording medium.\n* The second beam (known as the ''reference beam'') is also spread through the use of lenses, but is directed so that it doesn't come in contact with the scene, and instead travels directly onto the recording medium.\n\nSeveral different materials can be used as the recording medium. One of the most common is a film very similar to [[photographic film]] ([[silver halide]] [[photographic emulsion]]), but with a much higher concentration of light-reactive grains, making it capable of the much higher [[Optical resolution|resolution]] that holograms require. A layer of this recording medium (e.g., silver halide) is attached to a transparent substrate, which is commonly glass, but may also be plastic.\n\n===Process===\nWhen the two laser beams reach the recording medium, their light waves intersect and [[Interference (wave propagation)|interfere]] with each other. It is this interference pattern that is imprinted on the recording medium. The pattern itself is seemingly random, as it represents the way in which the scene's light ''interfered'' with the original light source \u2014 but not the original light source itself. The interference pattern can be considered an [[encoded]] version of the scene, requiring a particular key \u2014 the original light source \u2014 in order to view its contents.\n\nThis missing key is provided later by shining a laser, identical to the one used to record the hologram, onto the developed film. When this beam illuminates the hologram, it is [[diffraction|diffracted]] by the hologram's surface pattern. This produces a light field identical to the one originally produced by the scene and scattered onto the hologram.\n\n===Comparison with photography===\nHolography may be better understood via an examination of its differences from ordinary [[photography]]:\n* A hologram represents a recording of information regarding the light that came from the original scene as scattered in a range of directions rather than from only one direction, as in a photograph. This allows the scene to be viewed from a range of different angles, as if it were still present.\n* A photograph can be recorded using normal light sources (sunlight or electric lighting) whereas a laser is required to record a hologram.\n* A lens is required in photography to record the image, whereas in holography, the light from the object is scattered directly onto the recording medium.\n* A holographic recording requires a second light beam (the reference beam) to be directed onto the recording medium.\n* A photograph can be viewed in a wide range of lighting conditions, whereas holograms can only be viewed with very specific forms of illumination.\n* When a photograph is cut in half, each piece shows half of the scene. When a hologram is cut in half, the whole scene can still be seen in each piece. This is because, whereas each point in a [[photograph]] only represents light scattered from a single point in the scene, ''each point'' on a holographic recording includes information about light scattered from ''every point'' in the scene. It can be thought of as viewing a street outside a house through a {{convert|4|x|4|ft|cm|abbr=on|order=flip}} window, then through a {{convert|2|x|4|ft|cm|-1|abbr=on|order=flip}} window. One can see all of the same things through the smaller window (by moving the head to change the viewing angle), but the viewer can see more ''at once'' through the {{convert|4|ft|cm|abbr=on|order=flip}} window.\n* A photograph is a two-dimensional representation that can only reproduce a rudimentary three-dimensional effect, whereas the reproduced viewing range of a hologram adds many more [[Depth perception|depth perception cues]] that were present in the original scene. These cues are recognized by the [[human brain]] and translated into the same perception of a three-dimensional image as when the original scene might have been viewed.\n* A photograph clearly maps out the light field of the original scene. The developed hologram's surface consists of a very fine, seemingly random pattern, which appears to bear no relationship to the scene it recorded.\n\n==Physics of holography==\nFor a better understanding of the process, it is necessary to understand [[Interference (optics)|interference]] and [[diffraction]]. Interference occurs when one or more [[wavefronts]] are superimposed. [[Diffraction]] occurs when a wavefront encounters an object. The process of producing a holographic reconstruction is explained below purely in terms of interference and diffraction. It is somewhat simplified but is accurate enough to give an understanding of how the holographic process works.\n\nFor those unfamiliar with these concepts, it is worthwhile to read those articles before reading further in this article.\n\n===Plane wavefronts===\nA [[diffraction grating]] is a structure with a repeating pattern. A simple example is a metal plate with slits cut at regular intervals. A light wave that is incident on a grating is split into several waves; the direction of these diffracted waves is determined by the grating spacing and the wavelength of the light.\n\nA simple hologram can be made by superimposing two [[plane wave]]s from the same light source on a holographic recording medium. The two waves interfere, giving a [[Interference (optics)#Between two plane waves|straight-line fringe pattern]] whose intensity varies sinusoidally across the medium. The spacing of the fringe pattern is determined by the angle between the two waves, and by the wavelength of the light.\n\nThe recorded light pattern is a diffraction grating. When it is illuminated by only one of the waves used to create it, it can be shown that one of the diffracted waves emerges at the same angle as that at which the second wave was originally incident, so that the second wave has been 'reconstructed'. Thus, the recorded light pattern is a holographic recording as defined above.\n\n===Point sources===\n[[File:Zonenplatte Cosinus.png|upright|thumb|Sinusoidal zone plate]]\nIf the recording medium is illuminated with a point source and a normally incident plane wave, the resulting pattern is a [[Zone plate|sinusoidal zone plate]], which acts as a negative [[Fresnel lens]] whose focal length is equal to the separation of the point source and the recording plane.\n\nWhen a plane wave-front illuminates a negative lens, it is expanded into a wave that appears to diverge from the focal point of the lens. Thus, when the recorded pattern is illuminated with the original plane wave, some of the light is diffracted into a diverging beam equivalent to the original spherical wave; a holographic recording of the point source has been created.\n\nWhen the plane wave is incident at a non-normal angle at the time of recording, the pattern formed is more complex, but still acts as a negative lens if it is illuminated at the original angle.\n\n===Complex objects===\nTo record a hologram of a complex object, a laser beam is first split into two beams of light. One beam illuminates the object, which then scatters light onto the recording medium. According to [[diffraction]] theory, each point in the object acts as a point source of light so the recording medium can be considered to be illuminated by a set of point sources located at varying distances from the medium.\n\nThe second (reference) beam illuminates the recording medium directly. Each point source wave interferes with the reference beam, giving rise to its own sinusoidal zone plate in the recording medium. The resulting pattern is the sum of all these 'zone plates', which combine to produce a random ([[Speckle pattern|speckle]]) pattern as in the photograph above.\n\nWhen the hologram is illuminated by the original reference beam, each of the individual zone plates reconstructs the object wave that produced it, and these individual wavefronts are combined to reconstruct the whole of the object beam. The viewer perceives a wavefront that is identical with the wavefront scattered from the object onto the recording medium, so that it appears that the object is still in place even if it has been removed.\n\n===Mathematical model===\nA single-frequency light wave can be modeled by a [[complex number]], '''U''', which represents the [[electric]] or [[magnetic field]] of the [[electromagnetic radiation#Properties|light wave]]. The [[amplitude]] and [[Phase (waves)|phase]] of the light are represented by the [[Polar form|absolute value]] and [[Polar form|angle]] of the complex number. The object and reference waves at any point in the holographic system are given by '''U'''<sub>O</sub> and '''U'''<sub>R</sub>. The combined beam is given by '''U'''<sub>O</sub> + '''U'''<sub>R</sub>. The energy of the combined beams is proportional to the square of magnitude of the combined waves as\n\n:<math>\\left|U_\\text{O} + U_\\text{R}\\right|^2 = U_\\text{O} U_\\text{R}^* + \\left|U_\\text{R}\\right|^2 + \\left|U_\\text{O}\\right|^2 + U_\\text{O}^* U_\\text{R}</math>\n\nIf a photographic plate is exposed to the two beams and then developed, its transmittance, '''T''', is proportional to the light energy that was incident on the plate and is given by\n\n:<math>T = kU_\\text{O} U_\\text{R}^* + k\\left|U_\\text{R}\\right|^2 + k\\left|U_\\text{O}\\right|^2 + kU_\\text{O}^* U_\\text{R}</math>,\n\nwhere ''k'' is a constant.\n\nWhen the developed plate is illuminated by the reference beam, the light transmitted through the plate, '''U'''<sub>H</sub>, is equal to the transmittance, '''T''', multiplied by the reference beam amplitude, '''U'''<sub>R</sub>, giving\n\n:<math>U_H = TU_\\text{R} = kU_\\text{O} \\left|U_\\text{R}\\right|^2 + k\\left|U_\\text{R}\\right|^2 U_\\text{R} + k\\left|U_\\text{O}\\right|^2 U_\\text{R} + kU_\\text{O}^* U_\\text{R}^2</math>\n\nIt can be seen that '''U'''<sub>H</sub> has four terms, each representing a light beam emerging from the hologram. The first of these is proportional to '''U'''<sub>O</sub>. This is the reconstructed object beam, which enables a viewer to 'see' the original object even when it is no longer present in the field of view.\n\nThe second and third beams are modified versions of the reference beam. The fourth term is the \"conjugate object beam\". It has the reverse curvature to the object beam itself and forms a [[real image]] of the object in the space beyond the holographic plate.\n\nWhen the reference and object beams are incident on the holographic recording medium at significantly different angles, the virtual, real, and reference wavefronts all emerge at different angles, enabling the reconstructed object to be seen clearly.\n\n==Recording a hologram==\n\n===Items required===\n\n[[File:Holography setup.jpeg|thumb|An optical table being used to make a hologram]]\nTo make a hologram, the following are required:\n* a suitable object or set of objects\n* part of the laser beam to be directed so that it illuminates the object (the object beam) and another part so that it illuminates the recording medium directly (the reference beam), enabling the reference beam and the light which is scattered from the object onto the recording medium to form an interference pattern\n* a recording medium which converts this interference pattern into an optical element which modifies either the amplitude or the phase of an incident light beam according to the intensity of the interference pattern.\n* a laser beam that produces [[Coherence (physics)|coherent]] light with one [[wavelength]].\n* an environment which provides sufficient mechanical and thermal stability that the interference pattern is stable during the time in which the interference pattern is recorded<ref>Hariharan, (2002), Section 7,1. p60</ref>\n\nThese requirements are inter-related, and it is essential to understand the nature of optical interference to see this. [[Interference (optics)|Interference]] is the variation in [[intensity (physics)|intensity]] which can occur when two [[light waves]] are superimposed. The intensity of the maxima exceeds the sum of the individual intensities of the two beams, and the intensity at the minima is less than this and may be zero. The interference pattern maps the relative phase between the two waves, and any change in the relative phases causes the interference pattern to move across the field of view. If the relative phase of the two waves changes by one cycle, then the pattern drifts by one whole fringe. One phase cycle corresponds to a change in the relative distances travelled by the two beams of one wavelength. Since the wavelength of light is of the order of 0.5&nbsp;\u03bcm, it can be seen that very small changes in the optical paths travelled by either of the beams in the holographic recording system lead to movement of the interference pattern which is the holographic recording. Such changes can be caused by relative movements of any of the optical components or the object itself, and also by local changes in air-temperature. It is essential that any such changes are significantly less than the wavelength of light if a clear well-defined recording of the interference is to be created.\n\nThe exposure time required to record the hologram depends on the laser power available, on the particular medium used and on the size and nature of the object(s) to be recorded, just as in conventional photography. This determines the stability requirements. Exposure times of several minutes are typical when using quite powerful gas lasers and silver halide emulsions. All the elements within the optical system have to be stable to fractions of a \u03bcm over that period. It is possible to make holograms of much less stable objects by using a [[Laser pulse|pulsed laser]] which produces a large amount of energy in a very short time (\u03bcs or less).<ref>Martinez-Hurtado et al. {{doi|10.1021/la102693m}}</ref> These systems have been used to produce holograms of live people. A holographic portrait of Dennis Gabor was produced in 1971 using a pulsed ruby laser.<ref>Hariharan, (2002), Figure 4.5, p44</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://webmuseum.mit.edu/browser.php?m=objects&kv=67243&i=14558|title=Photograph of Dennis Gabor standing beside his holographic portrait|publisher=MIT|accessdate=2011-09-16|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120927132803/http://webmuseum.mit.edu/browser.php?m=objects&kv=67243&i=14558|archivedate=27 September 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThus, the laser power, recording medium sensitivity, recording time and mechanical and thermal stability requirements are all interlinked. Generally, the smaller the object, the more compact the optical layout, so that the stability requirements are significantly less than when making holograms of large objects.\n\nAnother very important laser parameter is its [[Coherence (physics)#Temporal coherence|coherence]].<ref>Hariharan, (2002), Section 4.2, p40</ref> This can be envisaged by considering a laser producing a sine wave whose frequency drifts over time; the coherence length can then be considered to be the distance over which it maintains a single frequency. This is important because two waves of different frequencies do not produce a stable interference pattern. The coherence length of the laser determines the depth of field which can be recorded in the scene. A good holography laser will typically have a coherence length of several meters, ample for a deep hologram.\n\nThe objects that form the scene must, in general, have optically rough surfaces so that they scatter light over a wide range of angles. A specularly reflecting (or shiny) surface reflects the light in only one direction at each point on its surface, so in general, most of the light will not be incident on the recording medium. A hologram of a shiny object can be made by locating it very close to the recording plate.<ref>Hariharan, (2002), Figure 7.2, p62</ref>\n\n===Hologram classifications===\n\nThere are three important properties of a hologram which are defined in this section. A given hologram will have one or other of each of these three properties, e.g. an amplitude modulated, thin, transmission hologram, or a phase modulated, volume, reflection hologram.\n\n====Amplitude and phase modulation holograms====\n\nAn amplitude modulation hologram is one where the amplitude of light diffracted by the hologram is proportional to the intensity of the recorded light. A straightforward example of this is [[photographic emulsion]] on a transparent substrate. The emulsion is exposed to the interference pattern, and is subsequently developed giving a transmittance which varies with the intensity of the pattern \u2013 the more light that fell on the plate at a given point, the darker the developed plate at that point.\n\nA phase hologram is made by changing either the thickness or the [[refractive index]] of the material in proportion to the intensity of the holographic interference pattern. This is a [[Grating equation|phase grating]] and it can be shown that when such a plate is illuminated by the original reference beam, it reconstructs the original object wavefront. The efficiency (i.e., the fraction of the illuminated object beam which is converted into the reconstructed object beam) is greater for phase than for amplitude modulated holograms.\n\n====Thin holograms and thick (volume) holograms====\n\nA thin hologram is one where the thickness of the recording medium is much less than the spacing of the interference fringes which make up the holographic recording. The thickness of a thin hologram can be down to 60&nbsp;nm by using a topological insulator material Sb<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>3</sub> thin film.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Yue|first=Zengji|last2=Xue|first2=Gaolei|last3=Liu|first3=Juan|last4=Wang|first4=Yongtian|last5=Gu|first5=Min|date=2017-05-18|title=Nanometric holograms based on a topological insulator material|journal=Nature Communications|language=en|volume=8|pages=ncomms15354|doi=10.1038/ncomms15354|pmc=5454374|pmid=28516906|bibcode=2017NatCo...815354Y}}</ref> Ultrathin holograms hold the potential to be integrated with everyday consumer electronics like smartphones.\n\nA thick or [[volume hologram]] is one where the thickness of the recording medium is greater than the spacing of the interference pattern. The recorded hologram is now a three dimensional structure, and it can be shown that incident light is diffracted by the grating only at a particular angle, known as the [[Bragg's law|Bragg angle]].<ref>Lipson, (2011), Seection 12.5.4, p443</ref> If the hologram is illuminated with a light source incident at the original reference beam angle but a broad spectrum of wavelengths; reconstruction occurs only at the wavelength of the original laser used. If the angle of illumination is changed, reconstruction will occur at a different wavelength and the colour of the re-constructed scene changes. A volume hologram effectively acts as a colour filter.\n\n====Transmission and reflection holograms====\nA transmission hologram is one where the object and reference beams are incident on the recording medium from the same side. In practice, several more mirrors may be used to direct the beams in the required directions.\n\nNormally, transmission holograms can only be reconstructed using a laser or a quasi-monochromatic source, but a particular type of transmission hologram, known as a rainbow hologram, can be viewed with white light.\n\nIn a reflection hologram, the object and reference beams are incident on the plate from opposite sides of the plate. The reconstructed object is then viewed from the same side of the plate as that at which the re-constructing beam is incident.\n\nOnly volume holograms can be used to make reflection holograms, as only a very low intensity diffracted beam would be reflected by a thin hologram.\n\nExamples of full-color reflection holograms of mineral specimens:\n<gallery mode=packed>\nElbaite on Quartz.JPG|Hologram of Elbaite on Quartz\nMiniature Tanzanite on Matrix.JPG|Hologram of Tanzanite on Matrix\nMulticoloured Elbaite through Quartz.JPG|Hologram of Tourmaline on Quartz\nAmethyst on Quartz.JPG|Hologram of Amethyst on Quartz\n</gallery>\n\n===Holographic recording media===\n\nThe recording medium has to convert the original interference pattern into an optical element that modifies either the [[amplitude]] or the [[phase (waves)|phase]] of an incident light beam in proportion to the intensity of the original light field.\n\nThe recording medium should be able to resolve fully all the fringes arising from interference between object and reference beam. These fringe spacings can range from tens of [[micrometers]] to less than one micrometer, i.e. spatial frequencies ranging from a few hundred to several thousand cycles/mm, and ideally, the recording medium should have a response which is flat over this range. Photographic film has a very low or even zero response at the frequencies involved and cannot be used to make a hologram \u2013 for example, the resolution of Kodak's professional black and white film<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kodak.com/eknec/documents/59/0900688a80300559/EpubBW400CN4036.pdf|title=Kodak black and white professional film&#124;|accessdate = 2011-09-14}}</ref> starts falling off at 20 lines/mm \u2014 it is unlikely that any reconstructed beam could be obtained using this film.\n\nIf the response is not flat over the range of spatial frequencies in the interference pattern, then the resolution of the reconstructed image may also be degraded.<ref>Hariharan, (1996), Section 6.4, p88</ref><ref>Kozma A & Zelenka JS, (1970), Effect of film resolution and size in holography, Journal of the Optical Society of America, 60, 34\u201343</ref>\n\nThe table below shows the principal materials used for holographic recording. Note that these do not include the materials used in the [[Holography#Mass replication of holograms|mass replication]] of an existing hologram, which are discussed in the next section. The resolution limit given in the table indicates the maximal number of interference lines/mm of the gratings. The required exposure, expressed as milli[[joule]]s (mJ) of photon energy impacting the surface area, is for a long exposure time. Short exposure times (less than {{frac|1|1000}} of a second, such as with a pulsed laser) require much higher exposure energies, due to [[reciprocity failure]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ General properties of recording materials for holography<ref>Hariharan, (2002), Table 6.1, p50</ref>\n|-\n!

Embossing, which is similar to the method used to stamp out plastic discs from a master in audio recording, involves copying this surface relief pattern by impressing it onto another material.\n\nThe first step in the embossing process is to make a stamper by [[Electrophoretic deposition|electrodeposition]] of [[nickel]] on the relief image recorded on the photoresist or photothermoplastic. When the nickel layer is thick enough, it is separated from the master hologram and mounted on a metal backing plate. The material used to make embossed copies consists of a [[polyester]] base film, a resin separation layer and a [[thermoplastic]] film constituting the holographic layer.\n\nThe embossing process can be carried out with a simple heated press. The bottom layer of the duplicating film (the thermoplastic layer) is heated above its softening point and pressed against the stamper, so that it takes up its shape. This shape is retained when the film is cooled and removed from the press. In order to permit the viewing of embossed holograms in reflection, an additional reflecting layer of aluminum is usually added on the hologram recording layer. This method is particularly suited to mass production.\n\nThe first book to feature a hologram on the front cover was ''The Skook'' (Warner Books, 1984) by [[JP Miller]], featuring an illustration by Miller. The first record album cover to have a hologram was \"UB44\", produced in 1982 for the British group UB40 by Advanced Holographics in Loughborough. This featured a 5.75\" square embossed hologram showing a 3D image of the letters UB carved out of polystyrene to look like stone and the numbers 44 hovering in space on the picture plane. On the inner sleeve was an explanation of the holographic process and instructions on how to light the hologram. ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'' published the first magazine with a hologram cover in March 1984.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://press.nationalgeographic.com/milestones/ |title=National Geographic Milestones |website=National Geographic Society}}</ref> Embossed holograms are used widely on credit cards, banknotes, and high value products for authentication purposes.<ref>Toal Vincent, 2012, Introcution to Holography, CRC Press, {{ISBN|978-1-4398-1868-8}}</ref>\n\nIt is possible to print holograms directly into steel using a sheet explosive charge to create the required surface relief.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.physorg.com/news124039000.html |title=Holograms with explosive power |publisher=Physorg.com |accessdate=2012-04-21}}</ref> The [[Royal Canadian Mint]] produces holographic gold and silver coinage through a complex stamping process.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mint.ca/store/coin/150-lunar-hologram-coin-year-of-the-rabbit-2011-prod990012|title = Lunar Holographic Coins|accessdate = 2011-09-14}}</ref>\n\nA hologram can be copied optically by illuminating it with a laser beam, and locating a second hologram plate so that it is illuminated both by the reconstructed object beam, and the illuminating beam. Stability and coherence requirements are significantly reduced if the two plates are located very close together.<ref>Harris JR, Sherman GC and Billings BH, 1966, Copying hologram, Applied Optics, 5, 665\u20136</ref> An [[refractive index|index]] matching fluid is often used between the plates to minimize spurious interference between the plates. Uniform illumination can be obtained by scanning point-by-point or with a beam shaped into a thin line.\n\n==Reconstructing and viewing the holographic image==\n[[File:Holographic autoportrait, Sofia.jpg|thumb|Holographic self-portrait, exhibited at the National Polytechnic Museum, Sofia]]\n\nWhen the hologram plate is illuminated by a laser beam identical to the reference beam which was used to record the hologram, an exact reconstruction of the original object wavefront is obtained. An imaging system (an eye or a camera) located in the reconstructed beam 'sees' exactly the same scene as it would have done when viewing the original. When the lens is moved, the image changes in the same way as it would have done when the object was in place. If several objects were present when the hologram was recorded, the reconstructed objects move relative to one another, i.e. exhibit [[parallax]], in the same way as the original objects would have done. It was very common in the early days of holography to use a chess board as the object and then take photographs at several different angles using the reconstructed light to show how the relative positions of the chess pieces appeared to change.\n\nA holographic image can also be obtained using a different laser beam configuration to the original recording object beam, but the reconstructed image will not match the original exactly.<ref>Hariharan, (2002), Section 2.3, p17</ref> When a laser is used to reconstruct the hologram, the image is [[speckle pattern|speckled]] just as the original image will have been. This can be a major drawback in viewing a hologram.\n\nWhite light consists of light of a wide range of wavelengths. Normally, if a hologram is illuminated by a white light source, each wavelength can be considered to generate its own holographic reconstruction, and these will vary in size, angle, and distance. These will be superimposed, and the summed image will wipe out any information about the original scene, as if superimposing a set of photographs of the same object of different sizes and orientations. However, a holographic image can be obtained using [[Electromagnetic spectrum#Visible radiation (light)|white light]] in specific circumstances, e.g. with volume holograms and rainbow holograms. The white light source used to view these holograms should always approximate to a point source, i.e. a spot light or the sun. An extended source (e.g. a fluorescent lamp) will not reconstruct a hologram since its light is incident at each point at a wide range of angles, giving multiple reconstructions which will \"wipe\" one another out.\n\nWhite light reconstructions do not contain speckles.\n\n===Volume holograms===\n{{main|Volume hologram}}\n\nA reflection-type volume hologram can give an acceptably clear reconstructed image using a white light source, as the hologram structure itself effectively filters out light of wavelengths outside a relatively narrow range. In theory, the result should be an image of approximately the same colour as the laser light used to make the hologram. In practice, with recording media that require chemical processing, there is typically a compaction of the structure due to the processing and a consequent colour shift to a shorter wavelength. Such a hologram recorded in a silver halide gelatin emulsion by red laser light will usually display a green image. Deliberate temporary alteration of the emulsion thickness before exposure, or permanent alteration after processing, has been used by artists to produce unusual colours and multicoloured effects.\n\n===Rainbow holograms===\n{{main|Rainbow hologram}}\n[[File:Rainbow hologram.jpeg|thumb|Rainbow hologram showing the change in colour in the vertical direction]]\nIn this method, parallax in the vertical plane is sacrificed to allow a bright, well-defined, [[color gradient|gradiently colored]] reconstructed image to be obtained using white light. The rainbow holography recording process usually begins with a standard transmission hologram and copies it using a horizontal slit to eliminate vertical [[parallax]] in the output image. The viewer is therefore effectively viewing the holographic image through a narrow horizontal slit, but the slit has been expanded into a window by the same [[Dispersion (optics)|dispersion]] that would otherwise smear the entire image. Horizontal parallax information is preserved but movement in the vertical direction results in a color shift rather than altered vertical perspective.<ref>Hariharan, (2002), Section 7.4, p63</ref> Because perspective effects are reproduced along one axis only, the subject will appear variously stretched or squashed when the hologram is not viewed at an optimum distance; this distortion may go unnoticed when there is not much depth, but can be severe when the distance of the subject from the plane of the hologram is very substantial. [[Stereopsis]] and horizontal motion parallax, two relatively powerful cues to depth, are preserved.\n\nThe holograms found on [[credit cards]] are examples of rainbow holograms. These are technically transmission holograms mounted onto a reflective surface like a [[PET film (biaxially oriented)|metalized polyethylene terephthalate]] substrate commonly known as [[polyethylene terephthalate|PET]].\n\n===Fidelity of the reconstructed beam===\n[[File:broken hologram.jpg|thumb|Reconstructions from two parts of a broken hologram. Note the different viewpoints required to see the whole object]]\nTo replicate the original object beam exactly, the reconstructing reference beam must be identical to the original reference beam and the recording medium must be able to fully resolve the interference pattern formed between the object and reference beams.<ref>S. Koreshev, A. Gromov, O. Nikanorov, [http://ntv.ifmo.ru/en/journal/120/journal_120.htm \"Modernized Software Complex for Synthesis and Reconstruction of Fresnel Holograms-Projectors\"], Scientific and Technical Journal of Information Technologies, Mechanics and Optics, Number 6, Volume 12, 2012</ref> Exact reconstruction is required in [[holographic interferometry]], where the holographically reconstructed wavefront [[Interference (wave propagation)|interferes]] with the wavefront coming from the actual object, giving a null fringe if there has been no movement of the object and mapping out the displacement if the object has moved. This requires very precise relocation of the developed holographic plate.\n\nAny change in the shape, orientation or wavelength of the reference beam gives rise to aberrations in the reconstructed image. For instance, the reconstructed image is magnified if the laser used to reconstruct the hologram has a longer wavelength than the original laser. Nonetheless, good reconstruction is obtained using a laser of a different wavelength, quasi-monochromatic light or white light, in the right circumstances.\n\nSince each point in the object illuminates all of the hologram, the whole object can be reconstructed from a small part of the hologram. Thus, a hologram can be broken up into small pieces and each one will enable the whole of the original object to be imaged. One does, however, lose information and the [[optical resolution|spatial resolution]] gets worse as the size of the hologram is decreased \u2014 the image becomes \"fuzzier\". The field of view is also reduced, and the viewer will have to change position to see different parts of the scene.\n\n==Applications==\n\n===Art===\nEarly on, artists saw the potential of holography as a medium and gained access to science laboratories to create their work. Holographic art is often the result of collaborations between scientists and artists, although some holographers would regard themselves as both an artist and a scientist.\n\n[[Salvador Dal\u00ed]] claimed to have been the first to employ holography artistically. He was certainly the first and best-known surrealist to do so, but the 1972 New York exhibit of Dal\u00ed holograms had been preceded by the holographic art exhibition that was held at the [[Cranbrook Academy of Art]] in Michigan in 1968 and by the one at the Finch College gallery in New York in 1970, which attracted national media attention.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://holophile.com/history.htm |title=The History and Development of Holography|publisher=Holophile.com |accessdate=2012-04-21}}</ref> In Great Britain, [[Margaret Benyon]] began using holography as an artistic medium in the late 1960s and had a solo exhibition at the [[University of Nottingham]] art gallery in 1969.<ref name=Coyle>{{Cite book| publisher = John Libbey and Company| isbn = 978-0-86196-266-2| pages = 65\u201388| editors = Philip Hayward (ed.)| last = Coyle| first = Rebecca| title = Culture, Technology & Creativity in the Late Twentieth Century| chapter = Holography \u2013 Art in the space of technology| location = London, England| date = 1990| chapterurl = https://books.google.ca/books?id=yLq3rM2at3cC&pg=PA67}}</ref> This was followed in 1970 by a solo show at the [[Lisson Gallery]] in London, which was billed as the \"first London expo of holograms and stereoscopic paintings\".<ref name=\"poster\">{{cite web|title=Margaret Benyon Holography|url=http://www.lissongallery.com/exhibitions/margaret-benyon|website=Lisson Gallery|accessdate=4 February 2016}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 1970s, a number of art studios and schools were established, each with their particular approach to holography. Notably, there was the San Francisco School of Holography established by [[Lloyd Cross]], The Museum of Holography in New York founded by Rosemary (Posy) H. Jackson, the Royal College of Art in London and the [[Lake Forest College]] Symposiums organised by [[Tung Jeong]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Integraf |url=http://www.integraf.com/tung_jeong.htm |title=Dr. Tung J. Jeong Biography |publisher=Integraf.com |accessdate=2012-04-21}}</ref> None of these studios still exist; however, there is the Center for the Holographic Arts in New York<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.holocenter.org |title=holocenter |publisher=holocenter |accessdate=2012-04-21}}</ref> and the HOLOcenter in Seoul, which offers artists a place to create and exhibit work.\n\nDuring the 1980s, many artists who worked with holography helped the diffusion of this so-called \"new medium\" in the art world, such as Harriet Casdin-Silver of the United States, [[Dieter Jung (artist)|Dieter Jung]] of Germany, and [[Moys\u00e9s Baumstein]] of [[Brazil]], each one searching for a proper \"language\" to use with the three-dimensional work, avoiding the simple holographic reproduction of a sculpture or object. For instance, in Brazil, many concrete poets (Augusto de Campos, D\u00e9cio Pignatari, Julio Plaza and Jos\u00e9 Wagner Garcia, associated with [[Moys\u00e9s Baumstein]]) found in holography a way to express themselves and to renew [[Concrete Poetry]].\n\nA small but active group of artists still integrate holographic elements into their work.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.universal-hologram.com/ |title=The Universal Hologram |website=Cherry Optical Holography}}</ref> Some are associated with novel holographic techniques; for example, artist Matt Brand<ref>Holographic metalwork http://www.zintaglio.com</ref> employed computational mirror design to eliminate image distortion from [[specular holography]].\n\nThe MIT Museum<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/museum/collections/holography.html |title=MIT Museum: Collections \u2013 Holography |publisher=Web.mit.edu |accessdate=2012-04-21}}</ref> and Jonathan Ross<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jrholocollection.com/ |title=The Jonathan Ross Hologram Collection |publisher=Jrholocollection.com |accessdate=2012-04-21}}</ref> both have extensive collections of holography and on-line catalogues of art holograms.\n\n===Data storage===\n{{Main|Holographic memory}}\n\nHolography can be put to a variety of uses other than recording images. [[Holographic data storage]] is a technique that can store information at high density inside crystals or photopolymers. The ability to store large amounts of information in some kind of medium is of great importance, as many electronic products incorporate storage devices. As current storage techniques such as [[Blu-ray Disc]] reach the limit of possible data density (due to the [[diffraction]]-limited size of the writing beams), holographic storage has the potential to become the next generation of popular storage media. The advantage of this type of data storage is that the volume of the recording media is used instead of just the surface.\nCurrently available [[spatial light modulator|SLMs]] can produce about 1000 different images a second at 1024\u00d71024-bit resolution. With the right type of medium (probably polymers rather than something like [[lithium niobate|LiNbO<sub>3</sub>]]), this would result in about one-[[gigabit per second|gigabit-per-second]] writing speed.{{Citation needed |reason=Probably polymers is a broad statement, and speed claim for theoretical medium needs some kind of cited material.|date=October 2018}} Read speeds can surpass this, and experts{{Who|date=October 2018}} believe one-[[terabit per second|terabit-per-second]] readout is possible.\n\nIn 2005, companies such as [[Optware]] and [[Maxell]] produced a 120mm disc that uses a holographic layer to store data to a potential 3.9[[terabyte|TB]], a format called [[Holographic Versatile Disc]]. As of September 2014, no commercial product has been released.\n\nAnother company, [[InPhase Technologies]], was developing a competing format, but went bankrupt in 2011 and all its assets were sold to Akonia Holographics, LLC.\n\nWhile many holographic data storage models have used \"page-based\" storage, where each recorded hologram holds a large amount of data, more recent research into using submicrometre-sized \"microholograms\" has resulted in several potential [[3D optical data storage]] solutions. While this approach to data storage can not attain the high data rates of page-based storage, the tolerances, technological hurdles, and cost of producing a commercial product are significantly lower.\n\n===Dynamic holography===\nIn static holography, recording, developing and reconstructing occur sequentially, and a permanent hologram is produced.\n\nThere also exist holographic materials that do not need the developing process and can record a hologram in a very short time. This allows one to use holography to perform some simple operations in an all-optical way. Examples of applications of such real-time holograms include [[phase-conjugate mirror]]s (\"time-reversal\" of light), optical cache memories, [[image processing]] (pattern recognition of time-varying images), and [[optical computing]].\n\nThe amount of processed information can be very high (terabits/s), since the operation is performed in parallel on a whole image. This compensates for the fact that the recording time, which is in the order of a [[microsecond]], is still very long compared to the processing time of an electronic computer. The optical processing performed by a dynamic hologram is also much less flexible than electronic processing. On one side, one has to perform the operation always on the whole image, and on the other side, the operation a hologram can perform is basically either a multiplication or a phase conjugation. In optics, addition and [[Fourier transform]] are already easily performed in linear materials, the latter simply by a lens. This enables some applications, such as a device that compares images in an optical way.<ref>R. Ryf et al. [http://ol.osa.org/abstract.cfm?id=65530 High-frame-rate joint Fourier-transform correlator based on Sn<sub>2</sub>P<sub>2</sub>S<sub>6</sub> crystal], Optics Letters '''26''', 1666\u20131668 (2001)</ref>\n\nThe search for novel [[:Category:Nonlinear optical materials|nonlinear optical materials]] for dynamic holography is an active area of research. The most common materials are [[photorefraction|photorefractive crystals]], but in [[semiconductor]]s or [[Heterojunction|semiconductor heterostructures]] (such as [[quantum well]]s), atomic vapors and gases, [[plasma (physics)|plasmas]] and even liquids, it was possible to generate holograms.\n\nA particularly promising application is [[optical phase conjugation]]. It allows the removal of the wavefront distortions a light beam receives when passing through an aberrating medium, by sending it back through the same aberrating medium with a conjugated phase. This is useful, for example, in free-space optical communications to compensate for atmospheric turbulence (the phenomenon that gives rise to the twinkling of starlight).\n\n===Hobbyist use===\n[[File:Contest3.jpg|thumb|''Peace Within Reach'', a Denisyuk DCG hologram by amateur Dave Battin]]\n\nSince the beginning of holography, amateur experimenters have explored its uses.\n\nIn 1971, [[Lloyd Cross]] opened the San Francisco School of Holography and taught amateurs how to make holograms using only a small (typically 5&nbsp;mW) [[helium-neon laser]] and inexpensive home-made equipment. Holography had been supposed to require a very expensive metal [[optical table]] set-up to lock all the involved elements down in place and damp any vibrations that could blur the interference fringes and ruin the hologram. Cross's home-brew alternative was a [[sandpit|sandbox]] made of a [[cinder block]] retaining wall on a plywood base, supported on stacks of old tires to isolate it from ground vibrations, and filled with sand that had been washed to remove dust. The laser was securely mounted atop the cinder block wall. The mirrors and simple lenses needed for directing, splitting and expanding the laser beam were affixed to short lengths of PVC pipe, which were stuck into the sand at the desired locations. The subject and the [[photographic plate]] holder were similarly supported within the sandbox. The holographer turned off the room light, blocked the laser beam near its source using a small [[relay]]-controlled shutter, loaded a plate into the holder in the dark, left the room, waited a few minutes to let everything settle, then made the exposure by remotely operating the laser shutter.\n\nMany of these holographers would go on to produce art holograms. In 1983, Fred Unterseher, a co-founder of the San Francisco School of Holography and a well-known holographic artist, published the ''Holography Handbook'', an easy-to-read guide to making holograms at home. This brought in a new wave of holographers and provided simple methods for using the then-available AGFA [[silver halide]] recording materials.\n\nIn 2000, [[Frank DeFreitas]] published the ''Shoebox Holography Book'' and introduced the use of inexpensive [[laser pointer]]s to countless [[hobby]]ists. For many years, it had been assumed that certain characteristics of semiconductor [[laser diodes]] made them virtually useless for creating holograms, but when they were eventually put to the test of practical experiment, it was found that not only was this untrue, but that some actually provided a [[coherence length]] much greater than that of traditional helium-neon gas lasers. This was a very important development for amateurs, as the price of red laser diodes had dropped from hundreds of dollars in the early 1980s to about $5 after they entered the mass market as a component of [[DVD]] players in the late 1990s. Now, there are thousands of amateur holographers worldwide.\n\nBy late 2000, holography kits with inexpensive laser pointer diodes entered the mainstream consumer market. These kits enabled students, teachers, and hobbyists to make several kinds of holograms without specialized equipment, and became popular gift items by 2005.<ref name=\"IEEE\">Stephen Cass: ''[https://spectrum.ieee.org/consumer-electronics/gaming/holiday-gifts-2005 Holiday Gifts 2005 Gifts and gadgets for technophiles of all ages: Do-It Yourself-3-D]''.

The holography community was surprised at the amazing sensitivity of DCG to green [[light]]. It had been assumed that this sensitivity would be uselessly slight or non-existent. Jeff Blyth responded with the G307 formulation of DCG to increase the speed and sensitivity to these new lasers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.holowiki.com/index.php/G307_DCG_Formula |title=A Holography FAQ |publisher=HoloWiki |date=2011-02-15 |accessdate=2012-04-21 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101106135632/http://www.holowiki.com/index.php/G307_DCG_Formula |archivedate=6 November 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nKodak and Agfa, the former major suppliers of holography-quality silver halide plates and films, are no longer in the market. While other manufacturers have helped fill the void, many amateurs are now making their own materials.

Measuring techniques included within acoustic holography are becoming increasingly popular in various fields, most notably those of transportation, vehicle and aircraft design, and NVH. The general idea of acoustic holography has led to different versions such as near-field acoustic holography (NAH) and statistically optimal near-field acoustic holography (SONAH).

A hologram is a photographic recording of a [[light field]], rather than an [[image]] formed by a [[Lens (optics)|lens]]. The holographic medium, i.e., the object produced by a holographic process (which itself may be referred to as a hologram) is usually unintelligible when viewed under [[Diffuse reflection|diffuse ambient light]]. It is an encoding of the light field as an [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]] pattern of variations in the [[opacity (optics)|opacity]], [[density]], or surface profile of the photographic medium. When suitably lit, the interference pattern [[Diffraction|diffracts]] the light into an accurate reproduction of the original light field, and the objects that were in it exhibit visual [[Depth perception|depth cues]] such as [[parallax]] and [[perspective (visual)|perspective]] that change realistically with the relative position of the observer. That is, the view of the image from different angles represents the subject viewed from similar angles.In this sense, holograms do not simply produce the illusion of depth but are truly three-dimensional images.\n\nIn its pure form, holography requires the use of [[laser]] light for illuminating the subject and for viewing the finished hologram. A [[Microscopic scale|microscopic]] level of detail throughout the recorded scene can be reproduced. In common practice, however, major image quality compromises are made to eliminate the need for laser illumination to view the hologram, and in some cases, to make it. Holographic portraiture often resorts to a non-holographic intermediate imaging procedure, to avoid the hazardous high-powered [[Laser#Pulsed operation|pulsed lasers]] otherwise needed to optically \"freeze\" moving subjects as perfectly as the extremely motion-intolerant holographic recording process requires. Holograms can now also be entirely computer-generated to show objects or scenes that never existed.\n\nHolography is distinct from [[lenticular lens|lenticular]] and other earlier [[autostereoscopy|autostereoscopic]] 3D display technologies, which can produce superficially similar results but are based on conventional lens imaging. Images requiring the aid of [[Stereoscopy|special glasses or other intermediate optics]], stage illusions such as [[Pepper's Ghost]] and other unusual, baffling, or seemingly magical images are often incorrectly called holograms.\n\nIt was invented by Dennis Gabor in 1948.\n\n==Overview and history==\nThe [[Magyars|Hungarian]]-[[British people|British]] physicist [[Dennis Gabor]] (in Hungarian: ''G\u00e1bor D\u00e9nes'')<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Gabor | first1 = Dennis | authorlink = Dennis Gabor | year = 1948 | title = A new microscopic principle | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 161 | issue = 4098| pages = 777\u20138 | doi=10.1038/161777a0|bibcode = 1948Natur.161..777G | pmid=18860291}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|doi = 10.1098/rspa.1949.0075|first = Dennis|last = Gabor|year = 1949|title = Microscopy by reconstructed wavefronts|journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society|volume = 197|pages = 454\u2013487|issue = 1051|bibcode = 1949RSPSA.197..454G }}</ref> was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 1971 \"for his invention and development of the holographic method\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1971/ |title=The Nobel Prize in Physics 1971 |publisher=Nobelprize.org |accessdate=2012-04-21}}</ref>\nHis work, done in the late 1940s, was built on pioneering work in the field of X-ray microscopy by other scientists including [[Mieczys\u0142aw Wolfke]] in 1920 and [[William Lawrence Bragg]] in 1939.<ref>Hariharan, (1996), Section 1.2, p4-5</ref> The discovery was an unexpected result of research into improving [[electron microscope]]s at the [[British Thomson-Houston]] (BTH) Company in [[Rugby, Warwickshire|Rugby]], England, and the company filed a patent in December 1947 (patent GB685286).

The object in the hologram is a toy van. It is no more possible to discern the subject of a hologram from this pattern than it is to identify what music has been recorded by looking at a [[compact disc|CD]] surface. Note that the hologram is described by the [[speckle pattern]], rather than the \"wavy\" line pattern.]]\n\nHolography is a technique that enables a light field (which is generally the result of a light source scattered off objects) to be recorded and later reconstructed when the original light field is no longer present, due to the absence of the original objects.<ref>Hariharan, (2002), Section 1, p1</ref> Holography can be thought of as somewhat similar to [[sound recording]], whereby a sound field created by vibrating matter like [[musical instrument]]s or [[vocal cords]], is encoded in such a way that it can be reproduced later, without the presence of the original vibrating matter. However, it is even more similar to [[Ambisonics|Ambisonic]] sound recording in which any listening angle of a sound field can be reproduced in the reproduction.\n\n===Laser===\nIn laser holography, the hologram is recorded using a source of [[laser]] light, which is very pure in its color and orderly in its composition. Various setups may be used, and several types of holograms can be made, but all involve the interaction of light coming from different directions and producing a microscopic interference pattern which a [[photographic plate|plate]], film, or other medium [[photography|photographically]] records.\n\nIn one common arrangement, the laser beam is split into two, one known as the [[signal beam|object beam]]<!-- the traditional term, despite the redirect that results --> and the other as the [[reference beam]]. The object beam is expanded by passing it through a lens and used to illuminate the subject. The recording medium is located where this light, after being reflected or scattered by the subject, will strike it. The edges of the medium will ultimately serve as a window through which the subject is seen, so its location is chosen with that in mind. The reference beam is expanded and made to shine directly on the medium, where it interacts with the light coming from the subject to create the desired interference pattern.\n\nLike conventional photography, holography requires an appropriate [[Exposure (photography)|exposure]] time to correctly affect the recording medium. Unlike conventional photography, during the exposure the light source, the optical elements, the recording medium, and the subject must all remain perfectly motionless relative to each other, to within about a quarter of the wavelength of the light, or the interference pattern will be blurred and the hologram spoiled. With living subjects and some unstable materials, that is only possible if a very intense and extremely brief pulse of laser light is used, a hazardous procedure which is rare and rarely done outside of scientific and industrial laboratory settings. Exposures lasting several seconds to several minutes, using a much lower-powered continuously operating laser, are typical.\n\n===Apparatus===\n\nA hologram can be made by shining part of the light beam directly into the recording medium, and the other part onto the object in such a way that some of the scattered light falls onto the recording medium. A more flexible arrangement for recording a hologram requires the laser beam to be aimed through a series of elements that change it in different ways. The first element is a [[beam splitter]] that divides the beam into two identical beams, each aimed in different directions:\n* One beam (known as the ''illumination'' or ''object beam'') is spread using [[Lens (optics)|lenses]] and directed onto the scene using [[mirror]]s. Some of the light scattered (reflected) from the scene then falls onto the recording medium.\n* The second beam (known as the ''reference beam'') is also spread through the use of lenses, but is directed so that it doesn't come in contact with the scene, and instead travels directly onto the recording medium.\n\nSeveral different materials can be used as the recording medium. One of the most common is a film very similar to [[photographic film]] ([[silver halide]] [[photographic emulsion]]), but with a much higher concentration of light-reactive grains, making it capable of the much higher [[Optical resolution|resolution]] that holograms require. A layer of this recording medium (e.g., silver halide) is attached to a transparent substrate, which is commonly glass, but may also be plastic.\n\n===Process===\nWhen the two laser beams reach the recording medium, their light waves intersect and [[Interference (wave propagation)|interfere]] with each other. It is this interference pattern that is imprinted on the recording medium. The pattern itself is seemingly random, as it represents the way in which the scene's light ''interfered'' with the original light source \u2014 but not the original light source itself. The interference pattern can be considered an [[encoded]] version of the scene, requiring a particular key \u2014 the original light source \u2014 in order to view its contents.\n\nThis missing key is provided later by shining a laser, identical to the one used to record the hologram, onto the developed film. When this beam illuminates the hologram, it is [[diffraction|diffracted]] by the hologram's surface pattern. This produces a light field identical to the one originally produced by the scene and scattered onto the hologram.\n\n===Comparison with photography===\nHolography may be better understood via an examination of its differences from ordinary [[photography]]:\n* A hologram represents a recording of information regarding the light that came from the original scene as scattered in a range of directions rather than from only one direction, as in a photograph. This allows the scene to be viewed from a range of different angles, as if it were still present.\n* A photograph can be recorded using normal light sources (sunlight or electric lighting) whereas a laser is required to record a hologram.\n* A lens is required in photography to record the image, whereas in holography, the light from the object is scattered directly onto the recording medium.\n* A holographic recording requires a second light beam (the reference beam) to be directed onto the recording medium.\n* A photograph can be viewed in a wide range of lighting conditions, whereas holograms can only be viewed with very specific forms of illumination.\n* When a photograph is cut in half, each piece shows half of the scene. When a hologram is cut in half, the whole scene can still be seen in each piece. This is because, whereas each point in a [[photograph]] only represents light scattered from a single point in the scene, ''each point'' on a holographic recording includes information about light scattered from ''every point'' in the scene. It can be thought of as viewing a street outside a house through a {{convert|4|x|4|ft|cm|abbr=on|order=flip}} window, then through a {{convert|2|x|4|ft|cm|-1|abbr=on|order=flip}} window. One can see all of the same things through the smaller window (by moving the head to change the viewing angle), but the viewer can see more ''at once'' through the {{convert|4|ft|cm|abbr=on|order=flip}} window.\n* A photograph is a two-dimensional representation that can only reproduce a rudimentary three-dimensional effect, whereas the reproduced viewing range of a hologram adds many more [[Depth perception|depth perception cues]] that were present in the original scene. These cues are recognized by the [[human brain]] and translated into the same perception of a three-dimensional image as when the original scene might have been viewed.\n* A photograph clearly maps out the light field of the original scene. The developed hologram's surface consists of a very fine, seemingly random pattern, which appears to bear no relationship to the scene it recorded.\n\n==Physics of holography==\nFor a better understanding of the process, it is necessary to understand [[Interference (optics)|interference]] and [[diffraction]]. Interference occurs when one or more [[wavefronts]] are superimposed. [[Diffraction]] occurs when a wavefront encounters an object. The process of producing a holographic reconstruction is explained below purely in terms of interference and diffraction. It is somewhat simplified but is accurate enough to give an understanding of how the holographic process works.\n\nFor those unfamiliar with these concepts, it is worthwhile to read those articles before reading further in this article.\n\n===Plane wavefronts===\nA [[diffraction grating]] is a structure with a repeating pattern. A simple example is a metal plate with slits cut at regular intervals. A light wave that is incident on a grating is split into several waves; the direction of these diffracted waves is determined by the grating spacing and the wavelength of the light.\n\nA simple hologram can be made by superimposing two [[plane wave]]s from the same light source on a holographic recording medium. The two waves interfere, giving a [[Interference (optics)#Between two plane waves|straight-line fringe pattern]] whose intensity varies sinusoidally across the medium. The spacing of the fringe pattern is determined by the angle between the two waves, and by the wavelength of the light.\n\nThe recorded light pattern is a diffraction grating. When it is illuminated by only one of the waves used to create it, it can be shown that one of the diffracted waves emerges at the same angle as that at which the second wave was originally incident, so that the second wave has been 'reconstructed'. Thus, the recorded light pattern is a holographic recording as defined above.\n\n===Point sources===\n[[File:Zonenplatte Cosinus.png|upright|thumb|Sinusoidal zone plate]]\nIf the recording medium is illuminated with a point source and a normally incident plane wave, the resulting pattern is a [[Zone plate|sinusoidal zone plate]], which acts as a negative [[Fresnel lens]] whose focal length is equal to the separation of the point source and the recording plane.\n\nWhen a plane wave-front illuminates a negative lens, it is expanded into a wave that appears to diverge from the focal point of the lens. Thus, when the recorded pattern is illuminated with the original plane wave, some of the light is diffracted into a diverging beam equivalent to the original spherical wave; a holographic recording of the point source has been created.\n\nWhen the plane wave is incident at a non-normal angle at the time of recording, the pattern formed is more complex, but still acts as a negative lens if it is illuminated at the original angle.\n\n===Complex objects===\nTo record a hologram of a complex object, a laser beam is first split into two beams of light. One beam illuminates the object, which then scatters light onto the recording medium. According to [[diffraction]] theory, each point in the object acts as a point source of light so the recording medium can be considered to be illuminated by a set of point sources located at varying distances from the medium.\n\nThe second (reference) beam illuminates the recording medium directly. Each point source wave interferes with the reference beam, giving rise to its own sinusoidal zone plate in the recording medium. The resulting pattern is the sum of all these 'zone plates', which combine to produce a random ([[Speckle pattern|speckle]]) pattern as in the photograph above.\n\nWhen the hologram is illuminated by the original reference beam, each of the individual zone plates reconstructs the object wave that produced it, and these individual wavefronts are combined to reconstruct the whole of the object beam. The viewer perceives a wavefront that is identical with the wavefront scattered from the object onto the recording medium, so that it appears that the object is still in place even if it has been removed.\n\n===Mathematical model===\nA single-frequency light wave can be modeled by a [[complex number]], '''U''', which represents the [[electric]] or [[magnetic field]] of the [[electromagnetic radiation#Properties|light wave]]. The [[amplitude]] and [[Phase (waves)|phase]] of the light are represented by the [[Polar form|absolute value]] and [[Polar form|angle]] of the complex number. The object and reference waves at any point in the holographic system are given by '''U'''<sub>O</sub> and '''U'''<sub>R</sub>. The combined beam is given by '''U'''<sub>O</sub> + '''U'''<sub>R</sub>. The energy of the combined beams is proportional to the square of magnitude of the combined waves as\n\n:<math>\\left|U_\\text{O} + U_\\text{R}\\right|^2 = U_\\text{O} U_\\text{R}^* + \\left|U_\\text{R}\\right|^2 + \\left|U_\\text{O}\\right|^2 + U_\\text{O}^* U_\\text{R}</math>\n\nIf a photographic plate is exposed to the two beams and then developed, its transmittance, '''T''', is proportional to the light energy that was incident on the plate and is given by\n\n:<math>T = kU_\\text{O} U_\\text{R}^* + k\\left|U_\\text{R}\\right|^2 + k\\left|U_\\text{O}\\right|^2 + kU_\\text{O}^* U_\\text{R}</math>,\n\nwhere ''k'' is a constant.\n\nWhen the developed plate is illuminated by the reference beam, the light transmitted through the plate, '''U'''<sub>H</sub>, is equal to the transmittance, '''T''', multiplied by the reference beam amplitude, '''U'''<sub>R</sub>, giving\n\n:<math>U_H = TU_\\text{R} = kU_\\text{O} \\left|U_\\text{R}\\right|^2 + k\\left|U_\\text{R}\\right|^2 U_\\text{R} + k\\left|U_\\text{O}\\right|^2 U_\\text{R} + kU_\\text{O}^* U_\\text{R}^2</math>\n\nIt can be seen that '''U'''<sub>H</sub> has four terms, each representing a light beam emerging from the hologram. The first of these is proportional to '''U'''<sub>O</sub>. This is the reconstructed object beam, which enables a viewer to 'see' the original object even when it is no longer present in the field of view.\n\nThe second and third beams are modified versions of the reference beam. The fourth term is the \"conjugate object beam\". It has the reverse curvature to the object beam itself and forms a [[real image]] of the object in the space beyond the holographic plate.\n\nWhen the reference and object beams are incident on the holographic recording medium at significantly different angles, the virtual, real, and reference wavefronts all emerge at different angles, enabling the reconstructed object to be seen clearly.\n\n==Recording a hologram==\n\n===Items required===\n\n[[File:Holography setup.jpeg|thumb|An optical table being used to make a hologram]]\nTo make a hologram, the following are required:\n* a suitable object or set of objects\n* part of the laser beam to be directed so that it illuminates the object (the object beam) and another part so that it illuminates the recording medium directly (the reference beam), enabling the reference beam and the light which is scattered from the object onto the recording medium to form an interference pattern\n* a recording medium which converts this interference pattern into an optical element which modifies either the amplitude or the phase of an incident light beam according to the intensity of the interference pattern.\n* a laser beam that produces [[Coherence (physics)|coherent]] light with one [[wavelength]].\n* an environment which provides sufficient mechanical and thermal stability that the interference pattern is stable during the time in which the interference pattern is recorded<ref>Hariharan, (2002), Section 7,1. p60</ref>\n\nThese requirements are inter-related, and it is essential to understand the nature of optical interference to see this. [[Interference (optics)|Interference]] is the variation in [[intensity (physics)|intensity]] which can occur when two [[light waves]] are superimposed. The intensity of the maxima exceeds the sum of the individual intensities of the two beams, and the intensity at the minima is less than this and may be zero. The interference pattern maps the relative phase between the two waves, and any change in the relative phases causes the interference pattern to move across the field of view. If the relative phase of the two waves changes by one cycle, then the pattern drifts by one whole fringe. One phase cycle corresponds to a change in the relative distances travelled by the two beams of one wavelength. Since the wavelength of light is of the order of 0.5&nbsp;\u03bcm, it can be seen that very small changes in the optical paths travelled by either of the beams in the holographic recording system lead to movement of the interference pattern which is the holographic recording. Such changes can be caused by relative movements of any of the optical components or the object itself, and also by local changes in air-temperature. It is essential that any such changes are significantly less than the wavelength of light if a clear well-defined recording of the interference is to be created.\n\nThe exposure time required to record the hologram depends on the laser power available, on the particular medium used and on the size and nature of the object(s) to be recorded, just as in conventional photography. This determines the stability requirements. Exposure times of several minutes are typical when using quite powerful gas lasers and silver halide emulsions. All the elements within the optical system have to be stable to fractions of a \u03bcm over that period. It is possible to make holograms of much less stable objects by using a [[Laser pulse|pulsed laser]] which produces a large amount of energy in a very short time (\u03bcs or less).<ref>Martinez-Hurtado et al. {{doi|10.1021/la102693m}}</ref> These systems have been used to produce holograms of live people. A holographic portrait of Dennis Gabor was produced in 1971 using a pulsed ruby laser.<ref>Hariharan, (2002), Figure 4.5, p44</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://webmuseum.mit.edu/browser.php?m=objects&kv=67243&i=14558|title=Photograph of Dennis Gabor standing beside his holographic portrait|publisher=MIT|accessdate=2011-09-16|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120927132803/http://webmuseum.mit.edu/browser.php?m=objects&kv=67243&i=14558|archivedate=27 September 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThus, the laser power, recording medium sensitivity, recording time and mechanical and thermal stability requirements are all interlinked. Generally, the smaller the object, the more compact the optical layout, so that the stability requirements are significantly less than when making holograms of large objects.\n\nAnother very important laser parameter is its [[Coherence (physics)#Temporal coherence|coherence]].<ref>Hariharan, (2002), Section 4.2, p40</ref> This can be envisaged by considering a laser producing a sine wave whose frequency drifts over time; the coherence length can then be considered to be the distance over which it maintains a single frequency. This is important because two waves of different frequencies do not produce a stable interference pattern. The coherence length of the laser determines the depth of field which can be recorded in the scene. A good holography laser will typically have a coherence length of several meters, ample for a deep hologram.\n\nThe objects that form the scene must, in general, have optically rough surfaces so that they scatter light over a wide range of angles. A specularly reflecting (or shiny) surface reflects the light in only one direction at each point on its surface, so in general, most of the light will not be incident on the recording medium. A hologram of a shiny object can be made by locating it very close to the recording plate.<ref>Hariharan, (2002), Figure 7.2, p62</ref>\n\n===Hologram classifications===\n\nThere are three important properties of a hologram which are defined in this section. A given hologram will have one or other of each of these three properties, e.g. an amplitude modulated, thin, transmission hologram, or a phase modulated, volume, reflection hologram.\n\n====Amplitude and phase modulation holograms====\n\nAn amplitude modulation hologram is one where the amplitude of light diffracted by the hologram is proportional to the intensity of the recorded light. A straightforward example of this is [[photographic emulsion]] on a transparent substrate. The emulsion is exposed to the interference pattern, and is subsequently developed giving a transmittance which varies with the intensity of the pattern \u2013 the more light that fell on the plate at a given point, the darker the developed plate at that point.\n\nA phase hologram is made by changing either the thickness or the [[refractive index]] of the material in proportion to the intensity of the holographic interference pattern. This is a [[Grating equation|phase grating]] and it can be shown that when such a plate is illuminated by the original reference beam, it reconstructs the original object wavefront. The efficiency (i.e., the fraction of the illuminated object beam which is converted into the reconstructed object beam) is greater for phase than for amplitude modulated holograms.\n\n====Thin holograms and thick (volume) holograms====\n\nA thin hologram is one where the thickness of the recording medium is much less than the spacing of the interference fringes which make up the holographic recording. The thickness of a thin hologram can be down to 60&nbsp;nm by using a topological insulator material Sb<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>3</sub> thin film.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Yue|first=Zengji|last2=Xue|first2=Gaolei|last3=Liu|first3=Juan|last4=Wang|first4=Yongtian|last5=Gu|first5=Min|date=2017-05-18|title=Nanometric holograms based on a topological insulator material|journal=Nature Communications|language=en|volume=8|pages=ncomms15354|doi=10.1038/ncomms15354|pmc=5454374|pmid=28516906|bibcode=2017NatCo...815354Y}}</ref> Ultrathin holograms hold the potential to be integrated with everyday consumer electronics like smartphones.\n\nA thick or [[volume hologram]] is one where the thickness of the recording medium is greater than the spacing of the interference pattern. The recorded hologram is now a three dimensional structure, and it can be shown that incident light is diffracted by the grating only at a particular angle, known as the [[Bragg's law|Bragg angle]].<ref>Lipson, (2011), Seection 12.5.4, p443</ref> If the hologram is illuminated with a light source incident at the original reference beam angle but a broad spectrum of wavelengths; reconstruction occurs only at the wavelength of the original laser used. If the angle of illumination is changed, reconstruction will occur at a different wavelength and the colour of the re-constructed scene changes. A volume hologram effectively acts as a colour filter.\n\n====Transmission and reflection holograms====\nA transmission hologram is one where the object and reference beams are incident on the recording medium from the same side. In practice, several more mirrors may be used to direct the beams in the required directions.\n\nNormally, transmission holograms can only be reconstructed using a laser or a quasi-monochromatic source, but a particular type of transmission hologram, known as a rainbow hologram, can be viewed with white light.\n\nIn a reflection hologram, the object and reference beams are incident on the plate from opposite sides of the plate. The reconstructed object is then viewed from the same side of the plate as that at which the re-constructing beam is incident.\n\nOnly volume holograms can be used to make reflection holograms, as only a very low intensity diffracted beam would be reflected by a thin hologram.\n\nExamples of full-color reflection holograms of mineral specimens:\n<gallery mode=packed>\nElbaite on Quartz.JPG|Hologram of Elbaite on Quartz\nMiniature Tanzanite on Matrix.JPG|Hologram of Tanzanite on Matrix\nMulticoloured Elbaite through Quartz.JPG|Hologram of Tourmaline on Quartz\nAmethyst on Quartz.JPG|Hologram of Amethyst on Quartz\n</gallery>\n\n===Holographic recording media===\n\nThe recording medium has to convert the original interference pattern into an optical element that modifies either the [[amplitude]] or the [[phase (waves)|phase]] of an incident light beam in proportion to the intensity of the original light field.\n\nThe recording medium should be able to resolve fully all the fringes arising from interference between object and reference beam. These fringe spacings can range from tens of [[micrometers]] to less than one micrometer, i.e. spatial frequencies ranging from a few hundred to several thousand cycles/mm, and ideally, the recording medium should have a response which is flat over this range. Photographic film has a very low or even zero response at the frequencies involved and cannot be used to make a hologram \u2013 for example, the resolution of Kodak's professional black and white film<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kodak.com/eknec/documents/59/0900688a80300559/EpubBW400CN4036.pdf|title=Kodak black and white professional film&#124;|accessdate = 2011-09-14}}</ref> starts falling off at 20 lines/mm \u2014 it is unlikely that any reconstructed beam could be obtained using this film.\n\nIf the response is not flat over the range of spatial frequencies in the interference pattern, then the resolution of the reconstructed image may also be degraded.<ref>Hariharan, (1996), Section 6.4, p88</ref><ref>Kozma A & Zelenka JS, (1970), Effect of film resolution and size in holography, Journal of the Optical Society of America, 60, 34\u201343</ref>\n\nThe table below shows the principal materials used for holographic recording. Note that these do not include the materials used in the [[Holography#Mass replication of holograms|mass replication]] of an existing hologram, which are discussed in the next section. The resolution limit given in the table indicates the maximal number of interference lines/mm of the gratings. The required exposure, expressed as milli[[joule]]s (mJ) of photon energy impacting the surface area, is for a long exposure time. Short exposure times (less than {{frac|1|1000}} of a second, such as with a pulsed laser) require much higher exposure energies, due to [[reciprocity failure]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ General properties of recording materials for holography<ref>Hariharan, (2002), Table 6.1, p50</ref>\n|-\n!

Embossing, which is similar to the method used to stamp out plastic discs from a master in audio recording, involves copying this surface relief pattern by impressing it onto another material.\n\nThe first step in the embossing process is to make a stamper by [[Electrophoretic deposition|electrodeposition]] of [[nickel]] on the relief image recorded on the photoresist or photothermoplastic. When the nickel layer is thick enough, it is separated from the master hologram and mounted on a metal backing plate. The material used to make embossed copies consists of a [[polyester]] base film, a resin separation layer and a [[thermoplastic]] film constituting the holographic layer.\n\nThe embossing process can be carried out with a simple heated press. The bottom layer of the duplicating film (the thermoplastic layer) is heated above its softening point and pressed against the stamper, so that it takes up its shape. This shape is retained when the film is cooled and removed from the press. In order to permit the viewing of embossed holograms in reflection, an additional reflecting layer of aluminum is usually added on the hologram recording layer. This method is particularly suited to mass production.\n\nThe first book to feature a hologram on the front cover was ''The Skook'' (Warner Books, 1984) by [[JP Miller]], featuring an illustration by Miller. The first record album cover to have a hologram was \"UB44\", produced in 1982 for the British group UB40 by Advanced Holographics in Loughborough. This featured a 5.75\" square embossed hologram showing a 3D image of the letters UB carved out of polystyrene to look like stone and the numbers 44 hovering in space on the picture plane. On the inner sleeve was an explanation of the holographic process and instructions on how to light the hologram. ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'' published the first magazine with a hologram cover in March 1984.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://press.nationalgeographic.com/milestones/ |title=National Geographic Milestones |website=National Geographic Society}}</ref> Embossed holograms are used widely on credit cards, banknotes, and high value products for authentication purposes.<ref>Toal Vincent, 2012, Introcution to Holography, CRC Press, {{ISBN|978-1-4398-1868-8}}</ref>\n\nIt is possible to print holograms directly into steel using a sheet explosive charge to create the required surface relief.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.physorg.com/news124039000.html |title=Holograms with explosive power |publisher=Physorg.com |accessdate=2012-04-21}}</ref> The [[Royal Canadian Mint]] produces holographic gold and silver coinage through a complex stamping process.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mint.ca/store/coin/150-lunar-hologram-coin-year-of-the-rabbit-2011-prod990012|title = Lunar Holographic Coins|accessdate = 2011-09-14}}</ref>\n\nA hologram can be copied optically by illuminating it with a laser beam, and locating a second hologram plate so that it is illuminated both by the reconstructed object beam, and the illuminating beam. Stability and coherence requirements are significantly reduced if the two plates are located very close together.<ref>Harris JR, Sherman GC and Billings BH, 1966, Copying hologram, Applied Optics, 5, 665\u20136</ref> An [[refractive index|index]] matching fluid is often used between the plates to minimize spurious interference between the plates. Uniform illumination can be obtained by scanning point-by-point or with a beam shaped into a thin line.\n\n==Reconstructing and viewing the holographic image==\n[[File:Holographic autoportrait, Sofia.jpg|thumb|Holographic self-portrait, exhibited at the National Polytechnic Museum, Sofia]]\n\nWhen the hologram plate is illuminated by a laser beam identical to the reference beam which was used to record the hologram, an exact reconstruction of the original object wavefront is obtained. An imaging system (an eye or a camera) located in the reconstructed beam 'sees' exactly the same scene as it would have done when viewing the original. When the lens is moved, the image changes in the same way as it would have done when the object was in place. If several objects were present when the hologram was recorded, the reconstructed objects move relative to one another, i.e. exhibit [[parallax]], in the same way as the original objects would have done. It was very common in the early days of holography to use a chess board as the object and then take photographs at several different angles using the reconstructed light to show how the relative positions of the chess pieces appeared to change.\n\nA holographic image can also be obtained using a different laser beam configuration to the original recording object beam, but the reconstructed image will not match the original exactly.<ref>Hariharan, (2002), Section 2.3, p17</ref> When a laser is used to reconstruct the hologram, the image is [[speckle pattern|speckled]] just as the original image will have been. This can be a major drawback in viewing a hologram.\n\nWhite light consists of light of a wide range of wavelengths. Normally, if a hologram is illuminated by a white light source, each wavelength can be considered to generate its own holographic reconstruction, and these will vary in size, angle, and distance. These will be superimposed, and the summed image will wipe out any information about the original scene, as if superimposing a set of photographs of the same object of different sizes and orientations. However, a holographic image can be obtained using [[Electromagnetic spectrum#Visible radiation (light)|white light]] in specific circumstances, e.g. with volume holograms and rainbow holograms. The white light source used to view these holograms should always approximate to a point source, i.e. a spot light or the sun. An extended source (e.g. a fluorescent lamp) will not reconstruct a hologram since its light is incident at each point at a wide range of angles, giving multiple reconstructions which will \"wipe\" one another out.\n\nWhite light reconstructions do not contain speckles.\n\n===Volume holograms===\n{{main|Volume hologram}}\n\nA reflection-type volume hologram can give an acceptably clear reconstructed image using a white light source, as the hologram structure itself effectively filters out light of wavelengths outside a relatively narrow range. In theory, the result should be an image of approximately the same colour as the laser light used to make the hologram. In practice, with recording media that require chemical processing, there is typically a compaction of the structure due to the processing and a consequent colour shift to a shorter wavelength. Such a hologram recorded in a silver halide gelatin emulsion by red laser light will usually display a green image. Deliberate temporary alteration of the emulsion thickness before exposure, or permanent alteration after processing, has been used by artists to produce unusual colours and multicoloured effects.\n\n===Rainbow holograms===\n{{main|Rainbow hologram}}\n[[File:Rainbow hologram.jpeg|thumb|Rainbow hologram showing the change in colour in the vertical direction]]\nIn this method, parallax in the vertical plane is sacrificed to allow a bright, well-defined, [[color gradient|gradiently colored]] reconstructed image to be obtained using white light. The rainbow holography recording process usually begins with a standard transmission hologram and copies it using a horizontal slit to eliminate vertical [[parallax]] in the output image. The viewer is therefore effectively viewing the holographic image through a narrow horizontal slit, but the slit has been expanded into a window by the same [[Dispersion (optics)|dispersion]] that would otherwise smear the entire image. Horizontal parallax information is preserved but movement in the vertical direction results in a color shift rather than altered vertical perspective.<ref>Hariharan, (2002), Section 7.4, p63</ref> Because perspective effects are reproduced along one axis only, the subject will appear variously stretched or squashed when the hologram is not viewed at an optimum distance; this distortion may go unnoticed when there is not much depth, but can be severe when the distance of the subject from the plane of the hologram is very substantial. [[Stereopsis]] and horizontal motion parallax, two relatively powerful cues to depth, are preserved.\n\nThe holograms found on [[credit cards]] are examples of rainbow holograms. These are technically transmission holograms mounted onto a reflective surface like a [[PET film (biaxially oriented)|metalized polyethylene terephthalate]] substrate commonly known as [[polyethylene terephthalate|PET]].\n\n===Fidelity of the reconstructed beam===\n[[File:broken hologram.jpg|thumb|Reconstructions from two parts of a broken hologram. Note the different viewpoints required to see the whole object]]\nTo replicate the original object beam exactly, the reconstructing reference beam must be identical to the original reference beam and the recording medium must be able to fully resolve the interference pattern formed between the object and reference beams.<ref>S. Koreshev, A. Gromov, O. Nikanorov, [http://ntv.ifmo.ru/en/journal/120/journal_120.htm \"Modernized Software Complex for Synthesis and Reconstruction of Fresnel Holograms-Projectors\"], Scientific and Technical Journal of Information Technologies, Mechanics and Optics, Number 6, Volume 12, 2012</ref> Exact reconstruction is required in [[holographic interferometry]], where the holographically reconstructed wavefront [[Interference (wave propagation)|interferes]] with the wavefront coming from the actual object, giving a null fringe if there has been no movement of the object and mapping out the displacement if the object has moved. This requires very precise relocation of the developed holographic plate.\n\nAny change in the shape, orientation or wavelength of the reference beam gives rise to aberrations in the reconstructed image. For instance, the reconstructed image is magnified if the laser used to reconstruct the hologram has a longer wavelength than the original laser. Nonetheless, good reconstruction is obtained using a laser of a different wavelength, quasi-monochromatic light or white light, in the right circumstances.\n\nSince each point in the object illuminates all of the hologram, the whole object can be reconstructed from a small part of the hologram. Thus, a hologram can be broken up into small pieces and each one will enable the whole of the original object to be imaged. One does, however, lose information and the [[optical resolution|spatial resolution]] gets worse as the size of the hologram is decreased \u2014 the image becomes \"fuzzier\". The field of view is also reduced, and the viewer will have to change position to see different parts of the scene.\n\n==Applications==\n\n===Art===\nEarly on, artists saw the potential of holography as a medium and gained access to science laboratories to create their work. Holographic art is often the result of collaborations between scientists and artists, although some holographers would regard themselves as both an artist and a scientist.\n\n[[Salvador Dal\u00ed]] claimed to have been the first to employ holography artistically. He was certainly the first and best-known surrealist to do so, but the 1972 New York exhibit of Dal\u00ed holograms had been preceded by the holographic art exhibition that was held at the [[Cranbrook Academy of Art]] in Michigan in 1968 and by the one at the Finch College gallery in New York in 1970, which attracted national media attention.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://holophile.com/history.htm |title=The History and Development of Holography|publisher=Holophile.com |accessdate=2012-04-21}}</ref> In Great Britain, [[Margaret Benyon]] began using holography as an artistic medium in the late 1960s and had a solo exhibition at the [[University of Nottingham]] art gallery in 1969.<ref name=Coyle>{{Cite book| publisher = John Libbey and Company| isbn = 978-0-86196-266-2| pages = 65\u201388| editors = Philip Hayward (ed.)| last = Coyle| first = Rebecca| title = Culture, Technology & Creativity in the Late Twentieth Century| chapter = Holography \u2013 Art in the space of technology| location = London, England| date = 1990| chapterurl = https://books.google.ca/books?id=yLq3rM2at3cC&pg=PA67}}</ref> This was followed in 1970 by a solo show at the [[Lisson Gallery]] in London, which was billed as the \"first London expo of holograms and stereoscopic paintings\".<ref name=\"poster\">{{cite web|title=Margaret Benyon Holography|url=http://www.lissongallery.com/exhibitions/margaret-benyon|website=Lisson Gallery|accessdate=4 February 2016}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 1970s, a number of art studios and schools were established, each with their particular approach to holography. Notably, there was the San Francisco School of Holography established by [[Lloyd Cross]], The Museum of Holography in New York founded by Rosemary (Posy) H. Jackson, the Royal College of Art in London and the [[Lake Forest College]] Symposiums organised by [[Tung Jeong]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Integraf |url=http://www.integraf.com/tung_jeong.htm |title=Dr. Tung J. Jeong Biography |publisher=Integraf.com |accessdate=2012-04-21}}</ref> None of these studios still exist; however, there is the Center for the Holographic Arts in New York<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.holocenter.org |title=holocenter |publisher=holocenter |accessdate=2012-04-21}}</ref> and the HOLOcenter in Seoul, which offers artists a place to create and exhibit work.\n\nDuring the 1980s, many artists who worked with holography helped the diffusion of this so-called \"new medium\" in the art world, such as Harriet Casdin-Silver of the United States, [[Dieter Jung (artist)|Dieter Jung]] of Germany, and [[Moys\u00e9s Baumstein]] of [[Brazil]], each one searching for a proper \"language\" to use with the three-dimensional work, avoiding the simple holographic reproduction of a sculpture or object. For instance, in Brazil, many concrete poets (Augusto de Campos, D\u00e9cio Pignatari, Julio Plaza and Jos\u00e9 Wagner Garcia, associated with [[Moys\u00e9s Baumstein]]) found in holography a way to express themselves and to renew [[Concrete Poetry]].\n\nA small but active group of artists still integrate holographic elements into their work.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.universal-hologram.com/ |title=The Universal Hologram |website=Cherry Optical Holography}}</ref> Some are associated with novel holographic techniques; for example, artist Matt Brand<ref>Holographic metalwork http://www.zintaglio.com</ref> employed computational mirror design to eliminate image distortion from [[specular holography]].\n\nThe MIT Museum<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/museum/collections/holography.html |title=MIT Museum: Collections \u2013 Holography |publisher=Web.mit.edu |accessdate=2012-04-21}}</ref> and Jonathan Ross<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jrholocollection.com/ |title=The Jonathan Ross Hologram Collection |publisher=Jrholocollection.com |accessdate=2012-04-21}}</ref> both have extensive collections of holography and on-line catalogues of art holograms.\n\n===Data storage===\n{{Main|Holographic memory}}\n\nHolography can be put to a variety of uses other than recording images. [[Holographic data storage]] is a technique that can store information at high density inside crystals or photopolymers. The ability to store large amounts of information in some kind of medium is of great importance, as many electronic products incorporate storage devices. As current storage techniques such as [[Blu-ray Disc]] reach the limit of possible data density (due to the [[diffraction]]-limited size of the writing beams), holographic storage has the potential to become the next generation of popular storage media. The advantage of this type of data storage is that the volume of the recording media is used instead of just the surface.\nCurrently available [[spatial light modulator|SLMs]] can produce about 1000 different images a second at 1024\u00d71024-bit resolution. With the right type of medium (probably polymers rather than something like [[lithium niobate|LiNbO<sub>3</sub>]]), this would result in about one-[[gigabit per second|gigabit-per-second]] writing speed.{{Citation needed |reason=Probably polymers is a broad statement, and speed claim for theoretical medium needs some kind of cited material.|date=October 2018}} Read speeds can surpass this, and experts{{Who|date=October 2018}} believe one-[[terabit per second|terabit-per-second]] readout is possible.\n\nIn 2005, companies such as [[Optware]] and [[Maxell]] produced a 120mm disc that uses a holographic layer to store data to a potential 3.9[[terabyte|TB]], a format called [[Holographic Versatile Disc]]. As of September 2014, no commercial product has been released.\n\nAnother company, [[InPhase Technologies]], was developing a competing format, but went bankrupt in 2011 and all its assets were sold to Akonia Holographics, LLC.\n\nWhile many holographic data storage models have used \"page-based\" storage, where each recorded hologram holds a large amount of data, more recent research into using submicrometre-sized \"microholograms\" has resulted in several potential [[3D optical data storage]] solutions. While this approach to data storage can not attain the high data rates of page-based storage, the tolerances, technological hurdles, and cost of producing a commercial product are significantly lower.\n\n===Dynamic holography===\nIn static holography, recording, developing and reconstructing occur sequentially, and a permanent hologram is produced.\n\nThere also exist holographic materials that do not need the developing process and can record a hologram in a very short time. This allows one to use holography to perform some simple operations in an all-optical way. Examples of applications of such real-time holograms include [[phase-conjugate mirror]]s (\"time-reversal\" of light), optical cache memories, [[image processing]] (pattern recognition of time-varying images), and [[optical computing]].\n\nThe amount of processed information can be very high (terabits/s), since the operation is performed in parallel on a whole image. This compensates for the fact that the recording time, which is in the order of a [[microsecond]], is still very long compared to the processing time of an electronic computer. The optical processing performed by a dynamic hologram is also much less flexible than electronic processing. On one side, one has to perform the operation always on the whole image, and on the other side, the operation a hologram can perform is basically either a multiplication or a phase conjugation. In optics, addition and [[Fourier transform]] are already easily performed in linear materials, the latter simply by a lens. This enables some applications, such as a device that compares images in an optical way.<ref>R. Ryf et al. [http://ol.osa.org/abstract.cfm?id=65530 High-frame-rate joint Fourier-transform correlator based on Sn<sub>2</sub>P<sub>2</sub>S<sub>6</sub> crystal], Optics Letters '''26''', 1666\u20131668 (2001)</ref>\n\nThe search for novel [[:Category:Nonlinear optical materials|nonlinear optical materials]] for dynamic holography is an active area of research. The most common materials are [[photorefraction|photorefractive crystals]], but in [[semiconductor]]s or [[Heterojunction|semiconductor heterostructures]] (such as [[quantum well]]s), atomic vapors and gases, [[plasma (physics)|plasmas]] and even liquids, it was possible to generate holograms.\n\nA particularly promising application is [[optical phase conjugation]]. It allows the removal of the wavefront distortions a light beam receives when passing through an aberrating medium, by sending it back through the same aberrating medium with a conjugated phase. This is useful, for example, in free-space optical communications to compensate for atmospheric turbulence (the phenomenon that gives rise to the twinkling of starlight).\n\n===Hobbyist use===\n[[File:Contest3.jpg|thumb|''Peace Within Reach'', a Denisyuk DCG hologram by amateur Dave Battin]]\n\nSince the beginning of holography, amateur experimenters have explored its uses.\n\nIn 1971, [[Lloyd Cross]] opened the San Francisco School of Holography and taught amateurs how to make holograms using only a small (typically 5&nbsp;mW) [[helium-neon laser]] and inexpensive home-made equipment. Holography had been supposed to require a very expensive metal [[optical table]] set-up to lock all the involved elements down in place and damp any vibrations that could blur the interference fringes and ruin the hologram. Cross's home-brew alternative was a [[sandpit|sandbox]] made of a [[cinder block]] retaining wall on a plywood base, supported on stacks of old tires to isolate it from ground vibrations, and filled with sand that had been washed to remove dust. The laser was securely mounted atop the cinder block wall. The mirrors and simple lenses needed for directing, splitting and expanding the laser beam were affixed to short lengths of PVC pipe, which were stuck into the sand at the desired locations. The subject and the [[photographic plate]] holder were similarly supported within the sandbox. The holographer turned off the room light, blocked the laser beam near its source using a small [[relay]]-controlled shutter, loaded a plate into the holder in the dark, left the room, waited a few minutes to let everything settle, then made the exposure by remotely operating the laser shutter.\n\nMany of these holographers would go on to produce art holograms. In 1983, Fred Unterseher, a co-founder of the San Francisco School of Holography and a well-known holographic artist, published the ''Holography Handbook'', an easy-to-read guide to making holograms at home. This brought in a new wave of holographers and provided simple methods for using the then-available AGFA [[silver halide]] recording materials.\n\nIn 2000, [[Frank DeFreitas]] published the ''Shoebox Holography Book'' and introduced the use of inexpensive [[laser pointer]]s to countless [[hobby]]ists. For many years, it had been assumed that certain characteristics of semiconductor [[laser diodes]] made them virtually useless for creating holograms, but when they were eventually put to the test of practical experiment, it was found that not only was this untrue, but that some actually provided a [[coherence length]] much greater than that of traditional helium-neon gas lasers. This was a very important development for amateurs, as the price of red laser diodes had dropped from hundreds of dollars in the early 1980s to about $5 after they entered the mass market as a component of [[DVD]] players in the late 1990s. Now, there are thousands of amateur holographers worldwide.\n\nBy late 2000, holography kits with inexpensive laser pointer diodes entered the mainstream consumer market. These kits enabled students, teachers, and hobbyists to make several kinds of holograms without specialized equipment, and became popular gift items by 2005.<ref name=\"IEEE\">Stephen Cass: ''[https://spectrum.ieee.org/consumer-electronics/gaming/holiday-gifts-2005 Holiday Gifts 2005 Gifts and gadgets for technophiles of all ages: Do-It Yourself-3-D]''.

The holography community was surprised at the amazing sensitivity of DCG to green [[light]]. It had been assumed that this sensitivity would be uselessly slight or non-existent. Jeff Blyth responded with the G307 formulation of DCG to increase the speed and sensitivity to these new lasers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.holowiki.com/index.php/G307_DCG_Formula |title=A Holography FAQ |publisher=HoloWiki |date=2011-02-15 |accessdate=2012-04-21 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101106135632/http://www.holowiki.com/index.php/G307_DCG_Formula |archivedate=6 November 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nKodak and Agfa, the former major suppliers of holography-quality silver halide plates and films, are no longer in the market.
