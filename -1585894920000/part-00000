In April 2004, they filmed the ''Soluna'' [[Television pilot|pilot]] which aired on UPN. UPN declined to pick up the series after the pilot.\n\nSoluna disbanded in late 2004, and Olivo concentrated on her career as an actress and solo musician.\n\nIn 2008, Olivo appeared in the dance single titled \"Deja Vu\" with an album release under Dauman Music which became a top 40 billboard dance chart  hit with remixes by Dj Escape known for several remixed hits for Beyonce. That same year, she appeared nude painted in head to toe silver on the cover of [[M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce]]'s ''[[Saints of Los Angeles]]'' album. Olivo is also on the cover of two well-known romance novels.\n\nOlivo appeared on the cover of the June 2009 issue of ''Playboy'' magazine. Inside, she appears in seven fully nude photos, shot by fashion photographer [[Terry Richardson]].<ref>{{cite magazine|authorlink1= Playboy Enterprises|title= Playboy June Issue|year=2009|magazine=Playboy Magazine}}</ref>\n\n===Stage and screen===\nThe ''Soluna'' pilot opened many doors for Olivo, allowing her the opportunity to return to her roots in the theater when she performed the lead female role in a new musical ''Hotel C'est L'Amour'', at [[Blank Theatre|The Blank Theatre]] in [[Los Angeles]]. In 2007, Olivo was nominated for an [[LA Weekly Theater Award]] for originating the role of \"Marie\" in this production.\n\nOlivo recently starred in the new Broadway musical ''[[Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark]]'' as a swing and understudy for the lead role of \"[[Arachne]]\". Previews began on November 28, 2010. When [[Natalie Mendoza]], who starred as Arachne, suffered a concussion at that first preview, Olivo played the role for several weeks in December 2010. The physically demanding role involves aerial sequences, including being spun upside-down.<ref>Healy, Patrick.

In April 2004, they filmed the ''Soluna'' [[Television pilot|pilot]] which aired on UPN. UPN declined to pick up the series after the pilot.\n\nSoluna disbanded in late 2004, and Olivo concentrated on her career as an actress and solo musician.\n\nIn 2008, Olivo appeared in the dance single titled \"Deja Vu\" with an album release under Dauman Music which became a top 40 billboard dance chart  hit with remixes by Dj Escape known for several remixed hits for Beyonce. That same year, she appeared nude painted in head to toe silver on the cover of [[M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce]]'s ''[[Saints of Los Angeles]]'' album. Olivo is also on the cover of two well-known romance novels.\n\nOlivo appeared on the cover of the June 2009 issue of ''Playboy'' magazine. Inside, she appears in seven fully nude photos, shot by fashion photographer [[Terry Richardson]].<ref>{{cite magazine|authorlink1= Playboy Enterprises|title= Playboy June Issue|year=2009|magazine=Playboy Magazine}}</ref>\n\n===Stage and screen===\nThe ''Soluna'' pilot opened many doors for Olivo, allowing her the opportunity to return to her roots in the theater when she performed the lead female role in a new musical ''Hotel C'est L'Amour'', at [[Blank Theatre|The Blank Theatre]] in [[Los Angeles]]. In 2007, Olivo was nominated for an [[LA Weekly Theater Award]] for originating the role of \"Marie\" in this production.\n\nOlivo recently starred in the new Broadway musical ''[[Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark]]'' as a swing and understudy for the lead role of \"[[Arachne]]\". Previews began on November 28, 2010. When [[Natalie Mendoza]], who starred as Arachne, suffered a concussion at that first preview, Olivo played the role for several weeks in December 2010. The physically demanding role involves aerial sequences, including being spun upside-down.<ref>Healy, Patrick.
