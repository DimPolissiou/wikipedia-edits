The film featured a vaudeville dancer performing a Butterfly Dance. Jenkins and his new partner [[Thomas Armat]] modified the Phantoscope for exhibitions in temporary theaters at the Cotton States Exposition in the fall of 1895. The Phantoscope was later sold to [[Thomas Edison]], who changed the name of the projector to Edison's Vitascope.

Mark]] and his brother [[Moe Mark]] added what they called Edison's [[Vitascope Theater]] (entered through [[Edisonia Hall]]), which they opened to the general public on October 19, 1896 in collaboration with [[Rudolf Wagner]], who had moved to Buffalo after spending several years working at the Edison laboratories. This 72-seat plush theater was designed from scratch solely to show motion pictures.\n\nTerry Ramseye, in his book, ''A Million and One Nights'' (1926) [p.&nbsp;276], notes that this \"was one of the earliest permanently located and exclusively motion-picture exhibitions.\" According to the ''Buffalo News'' (Wednesday, November 2, 1932), \"There were seats for about 90 persons [actually 72] and the admission was three cents.

Harris]] and Harry Davis opened a five-cents-admission movie theater in a [[Pittsburgh]] storefront, naming it the [[Nickelodeon (movie theater)|Nickelodeon]] and setting the style for the first common type of movie theater. By 1908 there were thousands of storefront Nickelodeons, Gems and Bijous across North America. A few theaters from the nickelodeon era are still showing films today.\n\nThe 1913 opening of the Regent Theater in New York City signaled a new respectability for the medium, and the start of the two-decade heyday of American cinema design. The million dollar [[Mark Strand Theatre]] at 47th Street and Broadway in New York City opened in 1914 by [[Mitchell Mark]] was the archetypical movie palace. The ornate [[Al. Ringling Theatre]] was built in Baraboo, WI by Al Ringling, one of the founders of the Ringling Bros. Circus, for the then-incredible sum of $100,000. Los Angeles showman [[Sid Grauman]] continued the trend of theater-as-destination with his ornate \"[[Million Dollar Theater]]\", using the same design firm as Ringling. It opened on Broadway in [[downtown Los Angeles]] in 1918.\n\nIn 1915, the tremendous success of ''[[The Birth of a Nation]]'' helped to establish the supremacy of [[feature film]]s,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.moviejustice.com/vault/index.php?p=getitem&db_id=4&item_id=27;|title=MJ Movie Reviews \u2013 Birth of a Nation, The (1915) by Dan DeVore<!-- Bot generated title -->|publisher=|accessdate=2 May 2018}}</ref> which forced the owners of five-cent theaters to increase the ticket price   to ten cents or more, then either remodel to provide a more comfortable and pleasant environment or relocate to a bigger and better auditorium, bringing the nickelodeon era to an end.<ref>[http://ct.essortment.com/nickelodeonshi_rqtl.htm The Nickelodeon's history<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080821033132/http://ct.essortment.com/nickelodeonshi_rqtl.htm |date=2008-08-21 }}</ref>\n\n==Post 1920s: the modern era==\nIn the next ten years, as movie revenues exploded, independent promoters and movie studios (who owned their own proprietary chains until an [[Competition law|antitrust]] ruling in 1948) raced to build the most lavish, elaborate, attractive theaters.\n\nThese forms morphed into a unique architectural genre\u2014the '''[[movie palace]]'''\u2014a unique and extreme architectural genre which boasted a luxurious design, a giant screen, and, beginning in 1953, [[stereophonic sound]]. The movie chains were also among the first industries to install [[air conditioning]] systems which gave the theaters an additional lure of comfort in the summer period. In 1931, a seat with a pivoted back was designed to allow people to remain seated while other patrons easily passed in front of them. This type of seat became standard in almost all US movie theaters.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=9ycDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA34&dq=Popular+Science+motor+gun+boat&hl=en&ei=HTLuTPyyFsOOnwe36dH2Cg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=7&ved=0CEUQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&q=Popular%20Science%20motor%20gun%20boat&f=true \"Theater Chair Has Adjustable Back\", March 1931, Popular Science] bottom of page 34</ref>\n\nSeveral [[movie studio]]s achieved [[vertical integration]] by acquiring and constructing theater chains. The so-called \"Big Five\" theater chains of the 1920s and 1930s were all owned by studios: [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]], [[Warner Bros.|Warner]], [[Loews Cineplex Entertainment|Loews]] (which owned [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]), [[20th Century Fox|Fox]], and [[RKO Pictures|RKO]]. All were broken up as a result of the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]]'s ruling in the 1948 ''[[United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc.]]'' [[Competition law|anti-trust]] case.\n\nIn the 1970s, \"[[adult movie theater]]s\" became ubiquitous in some areas. However, the introduction of the low-cost [[VHS]] video system for home televisions has decommissioned many porno cinemas as well as many 'second-run' theaters.\n\nPeople can pay to watch movies at home after a few short months following their theatrical release, through [[cable television]] or [[streaming media]]: [[pay-per-view]] (PPV) and [[video on demand]] (VOD). Initially, home video contributed to an industry wide slump in the late 1980s (see [[disruptive technology]]), not to mention the decline of the 'Dollar Cinema' (where first-run films are pulled from circulation to play at reduced rates for the remainder of their run). The theater industry responded by building larger auditoriums with [[stadium seating]] layouts, installing more screens (to allow for more variety and more show times), upgrading sound systems and installing more amenities and higher-quality food and drink. The growing popularity of [[high-definition television]] sets, along with [[HD DVD]] and [[Blu-ray Disc]] players may also contribute to the decline in cinema attendance, although there seems to be little evidence of this at the moment.\n\n==Movie theater culture in U.S.==\nMovie theaters are associated with [[dating]], [[popcorn]] and expensive treats.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}\n\n===Intimacy===\n[[File:Abandoned MiamiWay Theater, North Miami, Florida.jpg|thumb|right|Abandoned theater in [[North Miami, Florida]]]]\n[[File:Cinema Museum, London object 82.JPG|thumb|Usher's uniform, [[Cinema Museum (London)]]]]\n[[File:Cinema Museum, London object 47.JPG|thumb|An [[usherette tray]] for selling snacks]]\n\nSometimes couples go to a movie theater for the additional reason that it provides the possibility of intimacy, where the dark provides some privacy (with additional privacy in the back-row). This kind of intimacy is considered by some a lesser form of [[public display of affection]]. Compared with being together in a room without other people, it may also be reassuring for one or both of the couple (and for parents) that the intimacy is necessarily limited.\n\n[[Armrest|Arm rests]] pose a hindrance to intimacy for some people. Some theaters have love seats: seats for two without an armrest in the middle. The most modern theaters have movable armrests throughout the theater that when down can hold a food container as well as act as an armrest or partition between the seats and when up allow closer contact between the couple. Some theaters such as the [[Speakeasy Theaters|Parkway]] in [[Oakland, California]] have sofas for greater comfort.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parkway-speakeasy.com/images/album/a15/theater1.jpg|title=Sharing on : business, product, services, reviews, life, trend and much more.. -|website=Sharing on : business, product, services, reviews, life, trend and much more..|accessdate=2 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Foyer area, food and drinks===\nMovie theaters usually sell various [[snack food]]s and drinks at [[Concession stand|retail counters or kiosks]]. Sometimes it can be a self-service where one pays at the counter till, and/or a coin-operated machine. Sometimes the area of sale is more like a self-service shop or kiosk (it is not suitable for consuming the goods), and one pays at the check-out between the shop and the area with the screens. Foods usually served at movie theaters include [[popcorn]], [[soft drink]]s, [[nachos]], [[hot dog]]s, [[ice cream]]s and a wide range of [[confectionery]]. At most theaters, people are allowed to select their own sweets (known as \"[[pick 'n' mix|pick and mix]]\".)\n\nThe concessions for buying snacks and drinks often represent the theater's primary source of profit (snacks make up 20% of revenue but 40% of profits in the United States theaters, with a box of popcorn generating a profit of 85%)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://conversation.which.co.uk/consumer-rights/cinema-snacks-expensive-prices-popcorn/ |title=Sky-high cinema snack prices \u2013 how much is too much? |publisher=Conversation.which.co.uk |date=2012-03-24 |accessdate=2012-11-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Tuttle |first=Brad |url=http://moneyland.time.com/2009/12/07/movie-theaters-make-85-profit-at-concession-stands/ |title=Movie Theaters Make 85% Profit at Concession Stands &#124; TIME.com |publisher=Moneyland.time.com |date=2009-12-07 |accessdate=2012-11-04}}</ref> since most of the ticket revenue goes to the film distributor (and onward to the movie studio). Bringing one's own food and drinks may be forbidden (although not always strictly enforced) in order to maintain a [[captive market]], so theaters charge prices often threefold or higher than nearby stores, while popcorn has been marked up 900% according to ''[[CNN]]''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Tuttle |first=Brad |url=http://moneyland.time.com/2012/03/19/man-sues-movie-theater-for-charging-too-much-for-fountain-sodas/ |title=Why Does Movie-Theater Popcorn, Soda, Candy Cost So Much? &#124; TIME.com |publisher=Moneyland.time.com |date=2012-03-19 |accessdate=2012-11-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/galleries/2010/news/1001/gallery.americas_biggest_ripoffs/2.html |title=America's Biggest Rip-offs \u2013 Movie theater popcorn \u2013 900% markup (2) |publisher=CNNMoney.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-04}}</ref> Some movie theaters forbid eating and drinking inside the viewing room (restricting such activities to the foyer), while others encourage it by fitting [[cup holder]]s on the arm rests (on the front side of the arm rests of one's own chair, or the back side of the arm rests in front) and selling large portions of [[popcorn]] and soft drinks. According to a report by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, \"Theaters, it's been said, are really in the popcorn and candy business. The showing of films is just an excuse to gather a crowd and try to sell them buttery snacks and sugary drinks.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Tuttle |first=Brad |url=http://moneyland.time.com/2012/03/19/man-sues-movie-theater-for-charging-too-much-for-fountain-sodas/#ixzz25FhSUwIF |title=Why Does Movie-Theater Popcorn, Soda, Candy Cost So Much? |publisher=Moneyland.time.com |date=2012-03-19 |accessdate=2012-11-04}}</ref> This is not a new perspective on the financial importance of food and theaters.\nRetail is currently a huge area of expansion with many companies in the U.S. offering a wider range of snacks, including [[hot dog]]s and [[nachos]]. Some movie theaters feature a wider selection than simply snacks and popcorn. These \"dine-in\" theaters allow patrons to purchase \"meals\" (ranging from pizza slices to hamburgers and more) that can be consumed while watching the movie. Many theaters have embraced the \"brew and view\" concept, serving alcoholic beverages, in addition to snacks and popcorn. Some movie theaters such as the [[Living Room Theaters]] or [[Alamo Drafthouse Cinema|Alamo Drafthouse]] offer full restaurant service at one's seat, though this is not as widespread. [[McMenamins]] is a chain of [[restaurant]]/[[brewpub]] establishments in the U.S. states of [[Oregon]] and [[Washington (state)|Washington]], many of which have full movie theaters. By the mid 1940s in some smaller theaters popcorn alone was paying the overheads, even sometimes bringing in more revenue than ticket sales. One theater company in Kansas City had about 4000 acres producing popcorn, and an unnamed person commented \"Find a good popcorn location and build a theater around it.\"<ref>Smith, Andrew F. (1999).  [https://archive.org/details/poppedculturesoc00smit/page/57 <!-- quote=Breakfast cereal, breakfast. --> ''Popped Culture: The Social History of Popcorn in America''].

Owner of [[Sony Pictures]], Michael Lynton, has been one of the chief arguers over this, and has wanted cinemas worldwide to stop providing this junk food and instead provide healthier alternatives, like crudit\u00e9s, smoothies, nuts, granola bars and additive-free air-popped popcorn.\n\n===Altercations===\nPatrons are typically angered by cellphone use, talking, and other disturbances during the viewing. Although violence in American movie theaters is uncommon, there have been several notable cases of violence that occurred in movie theaters.\n\nIn 1989, screenings of ''[[Harlem Nights]]'' across the country lead to gunfire and fistfights. Two people were killed in a shooting in [[Southfield, Michigan]], and a teenage male was killed in a shooting at a theater in [[Richmond, California]]. The violence lead to controversy for the movie.\n\nIn May 1998, eight people were shot and injured in a gang-related attack during a screening of ''[[I Got the Hook Up]]'' at a theater in [[Bakersfield, California]].<ref>Reiss, Randy.

Feeble, flickering films of travel scenes were the usual fare.\" The theater remained open for two years, making it the first permanent movie theater in the world.\n\nThe State Theater in [[Washington, Iowa]] is the oldest continuously operating movie theater in the world.<ref name=tm>{{Cite web |url=http://thetheatremuseum.com/newsletter_37_2352351707.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-03-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906131904/http://thetheatremuseum.com/newsletter_37_2352351707.pdf |archive-date=2015-09-06 |url-status=dead }}</ref> It showed its first films in 1897,<ref name=tm/> and was inducted into the Guinness Book of World Records on April 21, 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fridleytheatres.com/washington.html|title=Fridley Theatres - State|website=www.fridleytheatres.com|accessdate=2 May 2018}}</ref> It is still in operation as of January 1, 2020.\n[[File:Vitascope Theater Buffalo Nov 1897 ad.jpg|thumb|November 7, 1897 ad for the Vitascope Theater in [[Buffalo, New York]], one of the first theaters created especially to show motion pictures.

Harris]] and Harry Davis opened a five-cents-admission movie theater in a [[Pittsburgh]] storefront, naming it the [[Nickelodeon (movie theater)|Nickelodeon]] and setting the style for the first common type of movie theater. By 1908 there were thousands of storefront Nickelodeons, Gems and Bijous across North America. A few theaters from the nickelodeon era are still showing films today.\n\nThe 1913 opening of the Regent Theater in New York City signaled a new respectability for the medium, and the start of the two-decade heyday of American cinema design. The million dollar [[Mark Strand Theatre]] at 47th Street and Broadway in New York City opened in 1914 by [[Mitchell Mark]] was the archetypical movie palace. The ornate [[Al. Ringling Theatre]] was built in Baraboo, WI by Al Ringling, one of the founders of the Ringling Bros. Circus, for the then-incredible sum of $100,000. Los Angeles showman [[Sid Grauman]] continued the trend of theater-as-destination with his ornate \"[[Million Dollar Theater]]\", using the same design firm as Ringling. It opened on Broadway in [[downtown Los Angeles]] in 1918.\n\nIn 1915, the tremendous success of ''[[The Birth of a Nation]]'' helped to establish the supremacy of [[feature film]]s,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.moviejustice.com/vault/index.php?p=getitem&db_id=4&item_id=27;|title=MJ Movie Reviews \u2013 Birth of a Nation, The (1915) by Dan DeVore<!-- Bot generated title -->|publisher=|accessdate=2 May 2018}}</ref> which forced the owners of five-cent theaters to increase the ticket price   to ten cents or more, then either remodel to provide a more comfortable and pleasant environment or relocate to a bigger and better auditorium, bringing the nickelodeon era to an end.<ref>[http://ct.essortment.com/nickelodeonshi_rqtl.htm The Nickelodeon's history<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080821033132/http://ct.essortment.com/nickelodeonshi_rqtl.htm |date=2008-08-21 }}</ref>\n\n==Post 1920s: the modern era==\nIn the next ten years, as movie revenues exploded, independent promoters and movie studios (who owned their own proprietary chains until an [[Competition law|antitrust]] ruling in 1948) raced to build the most lavish, elaborate, attractive theaters.\n\nThese forms morphed into a unique architectural genre\u2014the '''[[movie palace]]'''\u2014a unique and extreme architectural genre which boasted a luxurious design, a giant screen, and, beginning in 1953, [[stereophonic sound]]. The movie chains were also among the first industries to install [[air conditioning]] systems which gave the theaters an additional lure of comfort in the summer period. In 1931, a seat with a pivoted back was designed to allow people to remain seated while other patrons easily passed in front of them. This type of seat became standard in almost all US movie theaters.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=9ycDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA34&dq=Popular+Science+motor+gun+boat&hl=en&ei=HTLuTPyyFsOOnwe36dH2Cg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=7&ved=0CEUQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&q=Popular%20Science%20motor%20gun%20boat&f=true \"Theater Chair Has Adjustable Back\", March 1931, Popular Science] bottom of page 34</ref>\n\nSeveral [[movie studio]]s achieved [[vertical integration]] by acquiring and constructing theater chains. The so-called \"Big Five\" theater chains of the 1920s and 1930s were all owned by studios: [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]], [[Warner Bros.|Warner]], [[Loews Cineplex Entertainment|Loews]] (which owned [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]), [[20th Century Fox|Fox]], and [[RKO Pictures|RKO]]. All were broken up as a result of the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]]'s ruling in the 1948 ''[[United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc.]]'' [[Competition law|anti-trust]] case.\n\nIn the 1970s, \"[[adult movie theater]]s\" became ubiquitous in some areas. However, the introduction of the low-cost [[VHS]] video system for home televisions has decommissioned many porno cinemas as well as many 'second-run' theaters.\n\nPeople can pay to watch movies at home after a few short months following their theatrical release, through [[cable television]] or [[streaming media]]: [[pay-per-view]] (PPV) and [[video on demand]] (VOD). Initially, home video contributed to an industry wide slump in the late 1980s (see [[disruptive technology]]), not to mention the decline of the 'Dollar Cinema' (where first-run films are pulled from circulation to play at reduced rates for the remainder of their run). The theater industry responded by building larger auditoriums with [[stadium seating]] layouts, installing more screens (to allow for more variety and more show times), upgrading sound systems and installing more amenities and higher-quality food and drink. The growing popularity of [[high-definition television]] sets, along with [[HD DVD]] and [[Blu-ray Disc]] players may also contribute to the decline in cinema attendance, although there seems to be little evidence of this at the moment.\n\n==Movie theater culture in U.S.==\nMovie theaters are associated with [[dating]], [[popcorn]] and expensive treats.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}\n\n===Intimacy===\n[[File:Abandoned MiamiWay Theater, North Miami, Florida.jpg|thumb|right|Abandoned theater in [[North Miami, Florida]]]]\n[[File:Cinema Museum, London object 82.JPG|thumb|Usher's uniform, [[Cinema Museum (London)]]]]\n[[File:Cinema Museum, London object 47.JPG|thumb|An [[usherette tray]] for selling snacks]]\n\nSometimes couples go to a movie theater for the additional reason that it provides the possibility of intimacy, where the dark provides some privacy (with additional privacy in the back-row). This kind of intimacy is considered by some a lesser form of [[public display of affection]]. Compared with being together in a room without other people, it may also be reassuring for one or both of the couple (and for parents) that the intimacy is necessarily limited.\n\n[[Armrest|Arm rests]] pose a hindrance to intimacy for some people. Some theaters have love seats: seats for two without an armrest in the middle. The most modern theaters have movable armrests throughout the theater that when down can hold a food container as well as act as an armrest or partition between the seats and when up allow closer contact between the couple. Some theaters such as the [[Speakeasy Theaters|Parkway]] in [[Oakland, California]] have sofas for greater comfort.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parkway-speakeasy.com/images/album/a15/theater1.jpg|title=Sharing on : business, product, services, reviews, life, trend and much more.. -|website=Sharing on : business, product, services, reviews, life, trend and much more..|accessdate=2 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Foyer area, food and drinks===\nMovie theaters usually sell various [[snack food]]s and drinks at [[Concession stand|retail counters or kiosks]]. Sometimes it can be a self-service where one pays at the counter till, and/or a coin-operated machine. Sometimes the area of sale is more like a self-service shop or kiosk (it is not suitable for consuming the goods), and one pays at the check-out between the shop and the area with the screens. Foods usually served at movie theaters include [[popcorn]], [[soft drink]]s, [[nachos]], [[hot dog]]s, [[ice cream]]s and a wide range of [[confectionery]]. At most theaters, people are allowed to select their own sweets (known as \"[[pick 'n' mix|pick and mix]]\".)\n\nThe concessions for buying snacks and drinks often represent the theater's primary source of profit (snacks make up 20% of revenue but 40% of profits in the United States theaters, with a box of popcorn generating a profit of 85%)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://conversation.which.co.uk/consumer-rights/cinema-snacks-expensive-prices-popcorn/ |title=Sky-high cinema snack prices \u2013 how much is too much? |publisher=Conversation.which.co.uk |date=2012-03-24 |accessdate=2012-11-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Tuttle |first=Brad |url=http://moneyland.time.com/2009/12/07/movie-theaters-make-85-profit-at-concession-stands/ |title=Movie Theaters Make 85% Profit at Concession Stands &#124; TIME.com |publisher=Moneyland.time.com |date=2009-12-07 |accessdate=2012-11-04}}</ref> since most of the ticket revenue goes to the film distributor (and onward to the movie studio).

According to a report by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, \"Theaters, it's been said, are really in the popcorn and candy business. The showing of films is just an excuse to gather a crowd and try to sell them buttery snacks and sugary drinks.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Tuttle |first=Brad |url=http://moneyland.time.com/2012/03/19/man-sues-movie-theater-for-charging-too-much-for-fountain-sodas/#ixzz25FhSUwIF |title=Why Does Movie-Theater Popcorn, Soda, Candy Cost So Much? |publisher=Moneyland.time.com |date=2012-03-19 |accessdate=2012-11-04}}</ref> This is not a new perspective on the financial importance of food and theaters.\nRetail is currently a huge area of expansion with many companies in the U.S. offering a wider range of snacks, including [[hot dog]]s and [[nachos]]. Some movie theaters feature a wider selection than simply snacks and popcorn. These \"dine-in\" theaters allow patrons to purchase \"meals\" (ranging from pizza slices to hamburgers and more) that can be consumed while watching the movie. Many theaters have embraced the \"brew and view\" concept, serving alcoholic beverages, in addition to snacks and popcorn. Some movie theaters such as the [[Living Room Theaters]] or [[Alamo Drafthouse Cinema|Alamo Drafthouse]] offer full restaurant service at one's seat, though this is not as widespread. [[McMenamins]] is a chain of [[restaurant]]/[[brewpub]] establishments in the U.S. states of [[Oregon]] and [[Washington (state)|Washington]], many of which have full movie theaters. By the mid 1940s in some smaller theaters popcorn alone was paying the overheads, even sometimes bringing in more revenue than ticket sales. One theater company in Kansas City had about 4000 acres producing popcorn, and an unnamed person commented \"Find a good popcorn location and build a theater around it.\"<ref>Smith, Andrew F. (1999).  [https://archive.org/details/poppedculturesoc00smit/page/57 <!-- quote=Breakfast cereal, breakfast. --> ''Popped Culture: The Social History of Popcorn in America''].

Owner of [[Sony Pictures]], Michael Lynton, has been one of the chief arguers over this, and has wanted cinemas worldwide to stop providing this junk food and instead provide healthier alternatives, like crudit\u00e9s, smoothies, nuts, granola bars and additive-free air-popped popcorn.\n\n===Altercations===\nPatrons are typically angered by cellphone use, talking, and other disturbances during the viewing. Although violence in American movie theaters is uncommon, there have been several notable cases of violence that occurred in movie theaters.\n\nIn 1989, screenings of ''[[Harlem Nights]]'' across the country lead to gunfire and fistfights. Two people were killed in a shooting in [[Southfield, Michigan]], and a teenage male was killed in a shooting at a theater in [[Richmond, California]]. The violence lead to controversy for the movie.\n\nIn May 1998, eight people were shot and injured in a gang-related attack during a screening of ''[[I Got the Hook Up]]'' at a theater in [[Bakersfield, California]].<ref>Reiss, Randy.

Navajo is spoken primarily in the [[Southwestern United States]], especially in the [[Navajo Nation]]. It is one of the most widely spoken [[Indigenous languages of the Americas#Northern America|Native American language]]s and is the most widely spoken north of the [[Mexico\u2013United States border]], with almost 170,000 Americans speaking Navajo at home as of 2011. The language has struggled to keep a healthy speaker base, although this problem has been alleviated to some extent by extensive education programs on the Navajo Nation.\n\nThe language has a fairly large phoneme inventory; it includes several uncommon consonants that are not found in English. Its four basic vowels are distinguished for [[Nasal vowel|nasality]], [[Vowel length|length]], and [[tone (linguistics)|tone]]. It has both [[agglutinative language|agglutinative]] and [[fusional language|fusional]] elements: it relies on affixes to modify verbs, and nouns are typically created from multiple morphemes, but in both cases these morphemes are fused irregularly and beyond easy recognition. Basic [[word order]] is [[subject\u2013object\u2013verb]], though it is highly flexible to pragmatic factors. Verbs are conjugated for [[grammatical aspect|aspect]] and [[grammatical mood|mood]], and given affixes for the person and number of both [[subject (grammar)|subjects]] and [[object (grammar)|objects]], as well as a host of other variables.\n\nThe language's orthography, which was developed in the late 1930s after a series of prior attempts, is based on the [[Latin script]]. Most Navajo vocabulary is Athabaskan in origin, as the language has been conservative with loanwords since its early stages.\n\n==Nomenclature==\n\nThe word ''Navajo'' is an [[exonym]]: it comes from the [[Tewa language|Tewa]] word ''Navahu'', which combines the roots ''nava'' (\"field\") and ''hu'' (\"valley\") to mean \"large field\". It was borrowed into [[Spanish language|Spanish]] to refer to an area of present-day northwestern [[New Mexico]], and later into English for the [[Navajo]] tribe and their language.<ref>{{cite dictionary|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Navajo&allowed_in_frame=0|dictionary=Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=August 1, 2014|last=Harper|first=Douglas|title=Navajo|date=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810035022/http://etymonline.com/index.php?term=Navajo&allowed_in_frame=0|archivedate=August 10, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> The alternative spelling ''Navaho'' is considered antiquated; even anthropologist [[Berard Haile]] spelled it with a \"j\" in accordance with contemporary usage despite his personal objections.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bahr|2004|p=xxxv}}</ref> The Navajo refer to themselves as the ''Din\u00e9'' (\"People\"), with their language known as ''Din\u00e9 bizaad'' (\"People's language\")<ref>{{Harvnb|Minahan|2013|p=260}}</ref> or ''Naabeeh\u00f3 bizaad''.\n\n==Classification==\nNavajo is an [[Athabaskan languages|Athabaskan language]], and along with Apache languages, make up the southernmost branch of the family. Most of the other Athabaskan languages are located in Alaska and along the North American Pacific coast.\n\nMost languages in the Athabaskan family have [[tone (linguistics)|tone]]. However, this feature evolved independently in all subgroups; [[Athabaskan languages#Proto-Athabaskan|Proto-Athabaskan]] had no tones.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hargus|Rice|2005|p=139}}</ref> In each case, tone evolved from [[glottalic consonant]]s at the ends of morphemes; however, the progression of these consonants into tones has not been consistent, with some related morphemes being pronounced with high tones in some Athabaskan languages and low tones in others. It has been posited that Navajo and [[Chipewyan language|Chipewyan]], which have no common ancestor more recent than Proto-Athabaskan and possess many pairs of corresponding but opposite tones, evolved from different dialects of Proto-Athabaskan that pronounced these glottalic consonants differently.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hargus|Rice|2005|p=138}}</ref> Proto-Athabaskan diverged fully into separate languages circa 500 BCE.<ref>{{Harvnb|Johansen|Ritzker|2007|p=333}}</ref>\n\nNavajo is most closely related to [[Western Apache language|Western Apache]], with which it shares a similar tonal scheme<ref>{{Harvnb|Hargus|Rice|2005|p=209}}</ref> and more than 92 percent of its vocabulary. It is estimated that the [[Apache]]ean linguistic groups separated and became established as distinct societies, of which the Navajo were one, somewhere between 1300 and 1525.<ref>{{Harvnb|Levy|1998|p=25}}</ref> As a member of the Western Apachean group, Navajo's closest relative is the [[Mescalero-Chiricahua language]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Johansen|Ritzker|2007|p=334}}</ref> Navajo is generally considered [[mutual intelligibility|mutually intelligible]] with all other Apachean languages.<ref>{{Harvnb|Koenig|2005|p=9}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:NavajoSigns.png|thumb|right|upright=1.59|Examples of written Navajo on public signs.

In 1936, linguist [[Edward Sapir]] showed how the arrival of the Navajo people in the new arid climate among the corn agriculturalists of the Pueblo area was reflected in their language by tracing the changing meanings of words from Proto-Athabaskan to Navajo. For example, the word *''d\u00e8:'', which in Proto-Athabaskan meant \"horn\" and \"dipper made from animal horn\", in Navajo came to mean \"gourd\" or \"dipper made from gourd\". Likewise, the Proto-Athabaskan word *''\u026b-y\u00e1xs'' \"snow lies on the ground\" in Navajo became ''s\u00e0s'' \"corn lies on the ground\". Similarly, the Navajo word for \"corn\" is ''n\u00e0:-d\u0105:'', derived from two Proto-Athabaskan roots meaning \"enemy\" and \"food\", suggesting that the Navajo originally considered corn to be \"food of the enemy\" when they first arrived among the Pueblo people.<ref>Sapir, E.

When the [[United States]] annexed these territories in 1848 following the [[Mexican\u2013American War]],<ref name=\"Minahan 2013 261\"/> the English-speaking settlers allowed{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Navajo children to attend their schools. In some cases, the United States established separate schools for Navajo and other Native American children. In the late 19th century, it founded boarding schools, often operated by religious missionary groups. In efforts to [[acculturate]] the children, school authorities insisted that they learn to speak English and practice Christianity. Students routinely had their mouths washed out with lye soap as a punishment if they did speak Navajo.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/video/the-warrior-tradition-fkaz4h/|title=The Warrior Tradition &#124; The Warrior Tradition|via=www.pbs.org|access-date=2020-03-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191115052715/https://www.pbs.org/video/the-warrior-tradition-fkaz4h/|archive-date=2019-11-15|url-status=live}}</ref> Consequently, when these students grew up and had children of their own, they often did not teach them Navajo, in order to prevent them from being punished.<ref name=\"Johansen Ritzker 421\"/>\n\n[[Robert W.

It helped spread education among Navajo speakers.<ref name=\"Minahan 2013 262\">{{Harvnb|Minahan|2013|p=262}}</ref> In 1943 the men collaborated on ''The Navajo Language'', a dictionary organized by the roots of the language.<ref name=\"hargus\"/> In [[World War II]], the United States military used speakers of Navajo as [[code talker]]s&nbsp;\u2013 to transmit top-secret military messages over telephone and radio in a code based on Navajo. The language was considered ideal because of its grammar, which differs strongly from that of [[German language|German]] and [[Japanese language|Japanese]], and because no published Navajo dictionaries existed at the time.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/06/us/chester-nez-dies-at-93-his-native-tongue-helped-to-win-a-war-of-words.html?_r=1|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=June 5, 2014|title=Chester Nez, 93, Dies; Navajo Words Washed From Mouth Helped Win War|last=Fox|first=Margalit|accessdate=August 11, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140812203623/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/06/us/chester-nez-dies-at-93-his-native-tongue-helped-to-win-a-war-of-words.html?_r=1|archive-date=August 12, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nDespite gaining new scholarly attention and being documented, the language declined in use. By the 1960s, indigenous languages of the United States had been declining in use for some time. Native American language use began to decline more quickly in this decade as paved roads were built and English-language radio was broadcast to tribal areas. Navajo was no exception, although its large speaker pool\u2014larger than that of any other Native language in the United States\u2014gave it more staying power than most.<ref name=\"Johansen Ritzker 422\">{{Harvnb|Johansen|Ritzker|2007|p=422}}</ref> Adding to the language's decline, federal acts passed in the 1950s to increase educational opportunities for Navajo children had resulted in pervasive use of English in their schools.<ref name=\"Kroskrity Field 2009 38\"/>\n\n===Revitalization and current status===\nIn 1968, U.S. President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] signed the [[Bilingual Education Act]], which provided funds for educating young students who are not native English speakers. The Act had mainly been intended for Spanish-speaking children\u2014particularly [[Mexican Americans]]\u2014but it applied to all recognized linguistic minorities. Many Native American tribes seized the chance to establish their own bilingual education programs. However, qualified teachers who were fluent in Native languages were scarce, and these programs were largely unsuccessful.<ref name=\"Johansen Ritzker 422\"/>\n\nHowever, data collected in 1980 showed that 85 percent of Navajo first-graders were bilingual, compared to 62 percent of Navajo of all ages&nbsp;\u2013 early evidence of a resurgence of use of their traditional language among younger people.<ref>{{Harvnb|Koenig|2005|p=8}}</ref> In 1984, to counteract the language's historical decline, the [[Navajo Nation Council]] decreed that the Navajo language would be available and comprehensive for students of all grade levels in schools of the [[Navajo Nation]].<ref name=\"Johansen Ritzker 422\"/> This effort was aided by the fact that, largely due to the work of Young and Morgan, Navajo is one of the best-documented Native American languages.

To say 'give me some hay', the Navajo verb ''n\u00ed\u0142jool'' (Non-Compact Matter) must be used, while for 'give me a cigarette' the verb ''n\u00edt\u012f\u012fh'' (SSO) must be used.\nNavajo also contains a separate system of [[Navajo grammar#Classifiers (transitivity prefixes)|classifiers]] that generally marks for [[Voice (grammar)|voice]]. There are four classifiers: ''\u00d8-'', ''[[wikt:\u0142-#Navajo|\u0142-]]'', ''[[wikt:d-#Navajo|d-]]'', and ''[[wikt:l-#Navajo|l-]]'', placed between the personal prefixes and the verbal stem. The ''\u0142-'' classifier indicates causation (transitivity increase), e.g. ''yib\u00e9\u00e9zh'' (''yi-\u00d8-b\u00e9\u00e9zh'') 'it's boiling'  vs. ''yi\u0142b\u00e9\u00e9zh'' (''yi-\u0142-b\u00e9\u00e9zh'') 'he's boiling it'. The ''d-'' and ''l-'' classifiers indicate passive voice (transitivity reduction), e.g. ''yiz\u00e9\u00e9s'' (''yi-\u00d8-z\u00e9\u00e9s'') 'he's singeing it' vs. ''yid\u00e9\u00e9s'' (''yi-d-z\u00e9\u00e9s'') 'it's being singed' . The ''d-'' classifier is used to detransitivize verbs with ''\u00d8-'', while ''l-'' is used for verbs with ''\u0142-''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Faltz|1998|pp=40\u201341}}</ref>\n\n===Nouns===\nNouns are not required to form a complete Navajo sentence. Besides the extensive information that can be communicated with a verb, Navajo speakers may alternate between the third and fourth person to distinguish between two already specified actors, similarly to how speakers of languages with [[grammatical gender]] may repeatedly use pronouns.<ref name=\"Kozak 2013 161\">{{Harvnb|Kozak|2013|p=161}}</ref>\n\nMost nouns are not inflected for number,<ref name=\"Young Morgan 1992 882\"/> and plurality is usually encoded directly in the verb through the use of various prefixes or aspects, though this is by no means mandatory.

However, initial glottal stops are usually not marked.<ref name=\"Faltz 1998 3\"/> The [[voiceless glottal fricative]] ({{IPA|/h/}}) is normally written as ''h'', but appears as ''x'' after the consonants ''s'', ''z'', and digraphs ending in ''h'' to avoid phonological ambiguity.<ref name=\"Faltz 1998 5\"/><ref>{{Harvnb|McDonough|2003|p=85}}</ref> The [[voiced velar fricative]] is written as ''y'' before ''i'' and ''e'' (where it is palatalized {{IPA|/\u029d/}}), as ''w'' before ''o'' (where it is labialized {{IPA|/\u0263\u02b7/}}), and as ''gh'' before ''a''.<ref>{{Harvnb|McDonough|2003|p=160}}</ref>\n\nNavajo represents nasalized vowels with an [[ogonek]] ( \u02db ), sometimes described as a reverse [[cedilla]]; and represents the [[voiceless alveolar lateral fricative]] ({{IPA|/\u026c/}}) with a barred ''L'' (capital ''\u0141'', lowercase ''\u0142'').<ref name=\"Spolsky 2009 86\">{{Harvnb|Spolsky|2009|p=86}}</ref> The ogonek is placed centrally under a vowel, but it was imported from [[Polish orthography|Polish]] and [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]], which do not use it under certain vowels such as ''o'' or any vowels with accent marks.  For example, in proper Navajo writing, the ogonek below lowercase ''a'' is written centered below the letter, whereas fonts for ''a'' with ogonek intended for Polish and Lithuanian such as those used in common Web browsers render the ogonek connected to the bottom right of the letter.  As of 2017, no Unicode font has been developed to properly accommodate Navajo typography.

Navajo is spoken primarily in the [[Southwestern United States]], especially in the [[Navajo Nation]]. It is one of the most widely spoken [[Indigenous languages of the Americas#Northern America|Native American language]]s and is the most widely spoken north of the [[Mexico\u2013United States border]], with almost 170,000 Americans speaking Navajo at home as of 2011. The language has struggled to keep a healthy speaker base, although this problem has been alleviated to some extent by extensive education programs on the Navajo Nation.\n\nThe language has a fairly large phoneme inventory; it includes several uncommon consonants that are not found in English. Its four basic vowels are distinguished for [[Nasal vowel|nasality]], [[Vowel length|length]], and [[tone (linguistics)|tone]]. It has both [[agglutinative language|agglutinative]] and [[fusional language|fusional]] elements: it relies on affixes to modify verbs, and nouns are typically created from multiple morphemes, but in both cases these morphemes are fused irregularly and beyond easy recognition. Basic [[word order]] is [[subject\u2013object\u2013verb]], though it is highly flexible to pragmatic factors. Verbs are conjugated for [[grammatical aspect|aspect]] and [[grammatical mood|mood]], and given affixes for the person and number of both [[subject (grammar)|subjects]] and [[object (grammar)|objects]], as well as a host of other variables.\n\nThe language's orthography, which was developed in the late 1930s after a series of prior attempts, is based on the [[Latin script]]. Most Navajo vocabulary is Athabaskan in origin, as the language has been conservative with loanwords since its early stages.\n\n==Nomenclature==\n\nThe word ''Navajo'' is an [[exonym]]: it comes from the [[Tewa language|Tewa]] word ''Navahu'', which combines the roots ''nava'' (\"field\") and ''hu'' (\"valley\") to mean \"large field\". It was borrowed into [[Spanish language|Spanish]] to refer to an area of present-day northwestern [[New Mexico]], and later into English for the [[Navajo]] tribe and their language.<ref>{{cite dictionary|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Navajo&allowed_in_frame=0|dictionary=Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=August 1, 2014|last=Harper|first=Douglas|title=Navajo|date=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810035022/http://etymonline.com/index.php?term=Navajo&allowed_in_frame=0|archivedate=August 10, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> The alternative spelling ''Navaho'' is considered antiquated; even anthropologist [[Berard Haile]] spelled it with a \"j\" in accordance with contemporary usage despite his personal objections.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bahr|2004|p=xxxv}}</ref> The Navajo refer to themselves as the ''Din\u00e9'' (\"People\"), with their language known as ''Din\u00e9 bizaad'' (\"People's language\")<ref>{{Harvnb|Minahan|2013|p=260}}</ref> or ''Naabeeh\u00f3 bizaad''.\n\n==Classification==\nNavajo is an [[Athabaskan languages|Athabaskan language]], and along with Apache languages, make up the southernmost branch of the family. Most of the other Athabaskan languages are located in Alaska and along the North American Pacific coast.\n\nMost languages in the Athabaskan family have [[tone (linguistics)|tone]]. However, this feature evolved independently in all subgroups; [[Athabaskan languages#Proto-Athabaskan|Proto-Athabaskan]] had no tones.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hargus|Rice|2005|p=139}}</ref> In each case, tone evolved from [[glottalic consonant]]s at the ends of morphemes; however, the progression of these consonants into tones has not been consistent, with some related morphemes being pronounced with high tones in some Athabaskan languages and low tones in others. It has been posited that Navajo and [[Chipewyan language|Chipewyan]], which have no common ancestor more recent than Proto-Athabaskan and possess many pairs of corresponding but opposite tones, evolved from different dialects of Proto-Athabaskan that pronounced these glottalic consonants differently.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hargus|Rice|2005|p=138}}</ref> Proto-Athabaskan diverged fully into separate languages circa 500 BCE.<ref>{{Harvnb|Johansen|Ritzker|2007|p=333}}</ref>\n\nNavajo is most closely related to [[Western Apache language|Western Apache]], with which it shares a similar tonal scheme<ref>{{Harvnb|Hargus|Rice|2005|p=209}}</ref> and more than 92 percent of its vocabulary. It is estimated that the [[Apache]]ean linguistic groups separated and became established as distinct societies, of which the Navajo were one, somewhere between 1300 and 1525.<ref>{{Harvnb|Levy|1998|p=25}}</ref> As a member of the Western Apachean group, Navajo's closest relative is the [[Mescalero-Chiricahua language]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Johansen|Ritzker|2007|p=334}}</ref> Navajo is generally considered [[mutual intelligibility|mutually intelligible]] with all other Apachean languages.<ref>{{Harvnb|Koenig|2005|p=9}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:NavajoSigns.png|thumb|right|upright=1.59|Examples of written Navajo on public signs.

Handbook of North American Indians, 10, 489-501.</ref> Archaeological finds considered to be proto-Navajo have been located in the far northern New Mexico around the La Plata, Animas and Pine rivers, dating to around 1500. In 1936, linguist [[Edward Sapir]] showed how the arrival of the Navajo people in the new arid climate among the corn agriculturalists of the Pueblo area was reflected in their language by tracing the changing meanings of words from Proto-Athabaskan to Navajo. For example, the word *''d\u00e8:'', which in Proto-Athabaskan meant \"horn\" and \"dipper made from animal horn\", in Navajo came to mean \"gourd\" or \"dipper made from gourd\". Likewise, the Proto-Athabaskan word *''\u026b-y\u00e1xs'' \"snow lies on the ground\" in Navajo became ''s\u00e0s'' \"corn lies on the ground\". Similarly, the Navajo word for \"corn\" is ''n\u00e0:-d\u0105:'', derived from two Proto-Athabaskan roots meaning \"enemy\" and \"food\", suggesting that the Navajo originally considered corn to be \"food of the enemy\" when they first arrived among the Pueblo people.<ref>Sapir, E.

When the [[United States]] annexed these territories in 1848 following the [[Mexican\u2013American War]],<ref name=\"Minahan 2013 261\"/> the English-speaking settlers allowed{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Navajo children to attend their schools. In some cases, the United States established separate schools for Navajo and other Native American children. In the late 19th century, it founded boarding schools, often operated by religious missionary groups. In efforts to [[acculturate]] the children, school authorities insisted that they learn to speak English and practice Christianity. Students routinely had their mouths washed out with lye soap as a punishment if they did speak Navajo.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/video/the-warrior-tradition-fkaz4h/|title=The Warrior Tradition &#124; The Warrior Tradition|via=www.pbs.org|access-date=2020-03-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191115052715/https://www.pbs.org/video/the-warrior-tradition-fkaz4h/|archive-date=2019-11-15|url-status=live}}</ref> Consequently, when these students grew up and had children of their own, they often did not teach them Navajo, in order to prevent them from being punished.<ref name=\"Johansen Ritzker 421\"/>\n\n[[Robert W.

By the 1960s, indigenous languages of the United States had been declining in use for some time. Native American language use began to decline more quickly in this decade as paved roads were built and English-language radio was broadcast to tribal areas. Navajo was no exception, although its large speaker pool\u2014larger than that of any other Native language in the United States\u2014gave it more staying power than most.<ref name=\"Johansen Ritzker 422\">{{Harvnb|Johansen|Ritzker|2007|p=422}}</ref> Adding to the language's decline, federal acts passed in the 1950s to increase educational opportunities for Navajo children had resulted in pervasive use of English in their schools.<ref name=\"Kroskrity Field 2009 38\"/>\n\n===Revitalization and current status===\nIn 1968, U.S. President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] signed the [[Bilingual Education Act]], which provided funds for educating young students who are not native English speakers.

To say 'give me some hay', the Navajo verb ''n\u00ed\u0142jool'' (Non-Compact Matter) must be used, while for 'give me a cigarette' the verb ''n\u00edt\u012f\u012fh'' (SSO) must be used.\nNavajo also contains a separate system of [[Navajo grammar#Classifiers (transitivity prefixes)|classifiers]] that generally marks for [[Voice (grammar)|voice]]. There are four classifiers: ''\u00d8-'', ''[[wikt:\u0142-#Navajo|\u0142-]]'', ''[[wikt:d-#Navajo|d-]]'', and ''[[wikt:l-#Navajo|l-]]'', placed between the personal prefixes and the verbal stem. The ''\u0142-'' classifier indicates causation (transitivity increase), e.g. ''yib\u00e9\u00e9zh'' (''yi-\u00d8-b\u00e9\u00e9zh'') 'it's boiling'  vs. ''yi\u0142b\u00e9\u00e9zh'' (''yi-\u0142-b\u00e9\u00e9zh'') 'he's boiling it'. The ''d-'' and ''l-'' classifiers indicate passive voice (transitivity reduction), e.g. ''yiz\u00e9\u00e9s'' (''yi-\u00d8-z\u00e9\u00e9s'') 'he's singeing it' vs. ''yid\u00e9\u00e9s'' (''yi-d-z\u00e9\u00e9s'') 'it's being singed' . The ''d-'' classifier is used to detransitivize verbs with ''\u00d8-'', while ''l-'' is used for verbs with ''\u0142-''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Faltz|1998|pp=40\u201341}}</ref>\n\n===Nouns===\nNouns are not required to form a complete Navajo sentence. Besides the extensive information that can be communicated with a verb, Navajo speakers may alternate between the third and fourth person to distinguish between two already specified actors, similarly to how speakers of languages with [[grammatical gender]] may repeatedly use pronouns.<ref name=\"Kozak 2013 161\">{{Harvnb|Kozak|2013|p=161}}</ref>\n\nMost nouns are not inflected for number,<ref name=\"Young Morgan 1992 882\"/> and plurality is usually encoded directly in the verb through the use of various prefixes or aspects, though this is by no means mandatory. In the following example, the verb on the right is used with the plural prefix ''da-''  and switches to the distributive aspect.\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n{{interlinear| lang = nv| glossing3=yes\n|Kin \u00e1sh\u0142\u00e9\u00e9h.\n|kin \u00e1-{{gcl|\u00d8|empty morpheme}}-sh-\u0142\u00e9\u00e9h\n|house make-3.OBJ-1.SUBJ-make.MOM.{{gcl|IMPF|imperfective mode}}\n|'I build a house.'}}\n{{col-2}}\n{{interlinear| lang = nv| glossing3=yes\n|Kin \u00e1daashle\u02bc.\n|kin \u00e1-da-{{gcl|\u00d8|empty morpheme}}-sh-\u0142e\u02bc\n|house make-'''PL'''-3.OBJ-1.SUBJ-make.'''{{gcl|DIST|distributive aspect}}'''.{{gcl|IMPF|imperfective mode}}\n|'I build houses.'}}\n{{col-end}}\n\nSome verbal roots encode number in their lexical definition (see classificatory verbs above).

However, initial glottal stops are usually not marked.<ref name=\"Faltz 1998 3\"/> The [[voiceless glottal fricative]] ({{IPA|/h/}}) is normally written as ''h'', but appears as ''x'' after the consonants ''s'', ''z'', and digraphs ending in ''h'' to avoid phonological ambiguity.<ref name=\"Faltz 1998 5\"/><ref>{{Harvnb|McDonough|2003|p=85}}</ref> The [[voiced velar fricative]] is written as ''y'' before ''i'' and ''e'' (where it is palatalized {{IPA|/\u029d/}}), as ''w'' before ''o'' (where it is labialized {{IPA|/\u0263\u02b7/}}), and as ''gh'' before ''a''.<ref>{{Harvnb|McDonough|2003|p=160}}</ref>\n\nNavajo represents nasalized vowels with an [[ogonek]] ( \u02db ), sometimes described as a reverse [[cedilla]]; and represents the [[voiceless alveolar lateral fricative]] ({{IPA|/\u026c/}}) with a barred ''L'' (capital ''\u0141'', lowercase ''\u0142'').<ref name=\"Spolsky 2009 86\">{{Harvnb|Spolsky|2009|p=86}}</ref> The ogonek is placed centrally under a vowel, but it was imported from [[Polish orthography|Polish]] and [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]], which do not use it under certain vowels such as ''o'' or any vowels with accent marks.  For example, in proper Navajo writing, the ogonek below lowercase ''a'' is written centered below the letter, whereas fonts for ''a'' with ogonek intended for Polish and Lithuanian such as those used in common Web browsers render the ogonek connected to the bottom right of the letter.  As of 2017, no Unicode font has been developed to properly accommodate Navajo typography.

The enlistment draft is held in early-April annually. On the draftee selection day, those who are called up for the draft report to their selection center at 07:00. During roll call, eligible draftees can request to volunteer to serve, or they may choose to stay for the lottery. Those who volunteer then undergo physical and mental health examinations including a urine test for drugs.<ref name=\"BP-20180420\">{{cite news|last1=Laohong|first1=King-Oua|title=12,000 draftees 'on drugs'|url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/news/general/1448931/12-000-draftees-on-drugs|accessdate=20 April 2018|work=Bangkok Post|date=20 April 2018}}</ref> The results of the urine test for drugs are entered into a Narcotics Control Board database. In 2018, of the first 182,910 men entered in the database, 12,209 men, or 6.7 percent, tested positive for drugs: 11,139 for [[methamphetamine]], 750 for [[marijuana]], and the remainder for other drugs. Over 3,000 of those who tested positive will serve in the military where they will receive drug rehabilitation treatment. Those who tested positive, but who were not drafted, will undergo a 13-day rehabilitation regimen in their home provinces.<ref name=\"BP-20180420\" />  Those who do not pass the physical and mental health examinations are promptly discharged. The enlisting volunteers then choose the service branch (Royal Thai Army, Royal Thai Navy, or Royal Thai Air Force) and the reporting date of their choice, and receive documentation of the year's draft selection, and an enlistment order to report for basic training with notification details of the reporting time and location. The enlistees are then dismissed for the day until the enlistment day that they have to report for basic training.\n\nAfter the enlisting volunteers are dismissed for the day, the lottery process begins. Each selection center has a set quota, and the number of individuals conscripted through the lottery at each selection center will be the quota subtracted by the number of volunteers. Those who choose to proceed with the lottery then undergo the same physical and mental health exams as the volunteers, with the same procedure for dismissal for those who do not pass the health exams. Each man who stays for the lottery draws a card out of an opaque box. Those who draw a black card are discharged from their military service requirement and are issued the letter of exemption. Those who draw a red card are required to serve in the branch starting from the induction date as specified on the card. Those with higher educational qualification can request reduction of service obligation. In 2018, the Royal Thai Armed Forces called up more than 500,000 men for selection. The combined quota was approximately 104,000 men: 80,000 men for the [[Royal Thai Army]], 16,000 for the [[Royal Thai Navy]], and 8,700 for the [[Royal Thai Air Force]]. On selection day, there were 44,800 men who volunteered to serve. After accepting the volunteers and dismissing those who were deemed ineligible, there remained a quota of approximately 60,000 slots for approximately 450,000 men who entered the draft lottery, i.e., the overall probability of drawing a red card in the lottery was approximately 13%.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Nanuam|first1=Wassana|title=Image, pay draw volunteers for armed service| url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/news/general/1446206/image-pay-draw-volunteers-for-armed-service|accessdate=15 April 2018|work=Bangkok Post|date=15 April 2018}}</ref> In 2017, 103,097 men participated in the draft between 1\u201312 April. The armed forces needed only 77,000 conscripts per annum. It has not been uncommon for some selection centers to not have to conduct the balloting lottery at all, because the quota were fortunately met by the enlisting volunteers. In such instances, those who decided not to volunteer and stay for the lottery were all issued with a certificate of exemption.\n\nLength of service varies by whether a person volunteers to enlist and their educational background. The advantageous benefit of serving a shortened period of time are of course given to the volunteers who voluntarily enlist. Those without a high school diploma are required to serve 2 years regardless of whether they volunteer. High school graduates who volunteer are required to serve one year, while high school graduates who draw red cards are required to serve two years. Those with associate degree or higher who volunteer are required to serve for six months, while those with associate degree or higher who draw red cards can request reduction in time of service to one year. University students can request for deferment of conscription until they are awarded their diploma or reach 26 years of age.\n\nAll conscripts are in the grade of Private / Seaman / Aircraftman (OR-1) for the entire length of service, regardless of educational qualification. There are wage increases after completion of basic training and with time-in-grade.

It refers to the military forces of the [[Sukhothai Kingdom]], the [[Ayutthaya Kingdom]], the [[Thonburi Kingdom]] and the early [[Rattanakosin Kingdom]] in chronological order. The Siamese army was one of the dominant armed forces in Southeast Asia. As Thailand has never been colonized by a European power, the Royal Thai Armed Forces boasts one of the longest and uninterrupted military traditions in Asia.\n\nThe army was organized into a small standing army of a few thousand, which defended the capital and the palace, and a much larger [[conscription]]-based wartime army. Conscription was based on the \"ahmudan\" system, which required local chiefs to supply, in times of war, a predetermined quota of men from their jurisdiction on the basis of population. The wartime army also consisted of [[war elephants|elephantry]], [[cavalry]], [[artillery]], and [[navy|naval]] units.\n\nIn 1852, the Royal Siamese Armed Forces came into existence as permanent force at the behest of King [[Mongkut]], who needed a [[Europe]]an trained military force to thwart any Western threat and any attempts at colonialisation. By 1887, during the next reign of King [[Chulalongkorn]], a permanent military command in the [[Kalahom|''Kalahom'' Department]] was established. The office of ''Kalahom'', as a permanent office of war department, was established by King [[Borommatrailokkanat]] (1431\u20131488) in the mid-15th century during the [[Ayutthaya Kingdom]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080624075931/http://aarm2007.rta.mi.th/history_royal_th.htm The Royal Thai Army.

The only three foreign incursions into Thai territory were the [[Franco-Siamese War]], the [[Japanese invasion of Thailand]] in December 1941, and in the 1980s with [[Vietnam]]ese incursions into Thailand that led to several battles with the Thai Army. Operations on foreign territory were either territorial wars (such as the [[Laos Civil War]]) or conflicts mandated by the [[United Nations]].\n\n====Franco-Siamese War (1893)====\nWith the rapid expansion of the [[French Third Republic|French]] [[French colonial empire|Empire]] into [[Indochina]], conflicts necessarily occurred. War became inevitable when a French mission led by [[Auguste Pavie]] to King [[Chulalongkorn]] to try to bring [[Laos]] under French rule ended in failure. The French colonialists invaded Siam from the northeast and sent two warships to fight their way past the river forts and train their guns on the Grand Palace in [[Bangkok]] (the [[Paknam Incident]]). They also declared a blockade of Bangkok, which almost brought them into conflict with the British Navy. Siam was forced to accept the French [[ultimatum]] and surrendered Laos to France, also allowing French troops to occupy the Thai province of [[Chantaburi]] for several decades.<ref>[http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2005/11/02/headlines/data/headlines_19040213.html Legacy of the Paknam clash] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090421214229/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2005/11/02/headlines/data/headlines_19040213.html |date=21 April 2009 }}. nationmultimedia.com. 2 November 2005</ref>\n\n[[Image:Firstworldwar.jpg|thumb|230px|right|The Siamese Expeditionary Force in Paris, 1919.]]\n\n====World War I (1917\u20131918)====\n{{main|Siam in World War I}}\n\nKing [[Vajiravudh]] on 22 July 1917 declared war on the [[Central Powers]] and joined the [[Entente Powers]] on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]].

By playing the British Empire against Japan, Prime Minister Phibunsongkhram was able to maintain a degree of neutrality for some time. However, this ended in the early hours of 8 December 1941, when Japan launched a [[Japanese invasion of Thailand|surprise attack]] on Thailand at nine places along the coastline and from French Indo-China. The greatly outnumbered Thai forces put up resistance, but were soon overwhelmed. By 07:30, Phibun ordered an end to hostilities, though resistance continued for at least another day until all units could be notified. Phibun signed an [[armistice]] with Japan that allowed the empire to move its troops through Thai territory. Impressed by Japan's easy defeat of the British military in Malaya, Phibun formally made Thailand part of the [[Axis powers|Axis]] by declaring war on the United Kingdom and the United States, though the Regent refused to sign it in the young king's name. (The Thai ambassador to Washington refused to deliver the declaration, and the United States continued to consider Thailand an occupied country.) An active and foreign-assisted underground resistance movement, the [[Free Thai]], was largely successful and helped Thailand to rehabilitate after the war and be treated as an occupied nation rather than a defeated enemy.<ref>[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+th0031) Thailand].

Lcweb2.loc.gov. Retrieved on 18 January 2012.</ref> Many Thai military uniforms reflect historical foreign influences. For example, most of the distinctive service uniforms were patterned on those of the US, but lower ranking enlisted navy personnel wear uniforms resembling those of their French counterparts. The early influence of British advisers to the Thai royal court and the historical role of the military in royal pomp and ceremony contributed to the splendor of formal dress uniforms worn by high-ranking officers and guards of honour on ceremonial occasions.\n\n[[File:Royal Thai Army Band in the royal guard dress.jpg|thumb|230px|The [[Royal Thai Army]] Band in uniforms of various [[King's Guard (Thailand)|royal guards]] unit, ranked in the shape of the [[flag of Thailand]]]]\n\nThe rank structures of the three armed services are similar to those of the respective branches of the US Armed Forces, although the Thai system has fewer NCO and warrant officer designations. The king, as head of state and constitutional head of the armed forces, commissions all officers. Appointments to NCO ranks are authorised by the minister of defence. In theory, the authority and responsibilities of officers of various ranks correspond to those of their US counterparts. However, because of a perennial surplus of senior officers\u2014in 1987 there were some 600 generals and admirals in a total force of about 273,000\u2014Thai staff positions are often held by officers of higher rank than would be the case in the US or other Western military establishments.\n\nThai military personnel are highly conscious of rank distinctions and of the duties, obligations, and benefits they entail. Relationships among officers of different grades and among officers, NCOs, and the enlisted ranks are governed by military tradition in a society where observance of differences in status are highly formalised. The social distance between officers and NCOs is widened by the fact that officers usually are college or military academy graduates, while most NCOs have not gone beyond secondary school.

The enlistees are then dismissed for the day until the enlistment day that they have to report for basic training.\n\nAfter the enlisting volunteers are dismissed for the day, the lottery process begins. Each selection center has a set quota, and the number of individuals conscripted through the lottery at each selection center will be the quota subtracted by the number of volunteers. Those who choose to proceed with the lottery then undergo the same physical and mental health exams as the volunteers, with the same procedure for dismissal for those who do not pass the health exams. Each man who stays for the lottery draws a card out of an opaque box. Those who draw a black card are discharged from their military service requirement and are issued the letter of exemption. Those who draw a red card are required to serve in the branch starting from the induction date as specified on the card. Those with higher educational qualification can request reduction of service obligation. In 2018, the Royal Thai Armed Forces called up more than 500,000 men for selection. The combined quota was approximately 104,000 men: 80,000 men for the [[Royal Thai Army]], 16,000 for the [[Royal Thai Navy]], and 8,700 for the [[Royal Thai Air Force]]. On selection day, there were 44,800 men who volunteered to serve. After accepting the volunteers and dismissing those who were deemed ineligible, there remained a quota of approximately 60,000 slots for approximately 450,000 men who entered the draft lottery, i.e., the overall probability of drawing a red card in the lottery was approximately 13%.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Nanuam|first1=Wassana|title=Image, pay draw volunteers for armed service| url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/news/general/1446206/image-pay-draw-volunteers-for-armed-service|accessdate=15 April 2018|work=Bangkok Post|date=15 April 2018}}</ref> In 2017, 103,097 men participated in the draft between 1\u201312 April. The armed forces needed only 77,000 conscripts per annum. It has not been uncommon for some selection centers to not have to conduct the balloting lottery at all, because the quota were fortunately met by the enlisting volunteers. In such instances, those who decided not to volunteer and stay for the lottery were all issued with a certificate of exemption.\n\nLength of service varies by whether a person volunteers to enlist and their educational background. The advantageous benefit of serving a shortened period of time are of course given to the volunteers who voluntarily enlist. Those without a high school diploma are required to serve 2 years regardless of whether they volunteer. High school graduates who volunteer are required to serve one year, while high school graduates who draw red cards are required to serve two years. Those with associate degree or higher who volunteer are required to serve for six months, while those with associate degree or higher who draw red cards can request reduction in time of service to one year. University students can request for deferment of conscription until they are awarded their diploma or reach 26 years of age.\n\nAll conscripts are in the grade of Private / Seaman / Aircraftman (OR-1) for the entire length of service, regardless of educational qualification. There are wage increases after completion of basic training and with time-in-grade.

It refers to the military forces of the [[Sukhothai Kingdom]], the [[Ayutthaya Kingdom]], the [[Thonburi Kingdom]] and the early [[Rattanakosin Kingdom]] in chronological order. The Siamese army was one of the dominant armed forces in Southeast Asia. As Thailand has never been colonized by a European power, the Royal Thai Armed Forces boasts one of the longest and uninterrupted military traditions in Asia.\n\nThe army was organized into a small standing army of a few thousand, which defended the capital and the palace, and a much larger [[conscription]]-based wartime army. Conscription was based on the \"ahmudan\" system, which required local chiefs to supply, in times of war, a predetermined quota of men from their jurisdiction on the basis of population. The wartime army also consisted of [[war elephants|elephantry]], [[cavalry]], [[artillery]], and [[navy|naval]] units.\n\nIn 1852, the Royal Siamese Armed Forces came into existence as permanent force at the behest of King [[Mongkut]], who needed a [[Europe]]an trained military force to thwart any Western threat and any attempts at colonialisation. By 1887, during the next reign of King [[Chulalongkorn]], a permanent military command in the [[Kalahom|''Kalahom'' Department]] was established. The office of ''Kalahom'', as a permanent office of war department, was established by King [[Borommatrailokkanat]] (1431\u20131488) in the mid-15th century during the [[Ayutthaya Kingdom]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080624075931/http://aarm2007.rta.mi.th/history_royal_th.htm The Royal Thai Army.

However, most these were within [[Southeast Asia]]. The only three foreign incursions into Thai territory were the [[Franco-Siamese War]], the [[Japanese invasion of Thailand]] in December 1941, and in the 1980s with [[Vietnam]]ese incursions into Thailand that led to several battles with the Thai Army. Operations on foreign territory were either territorial wars (such as the [[Laos Civil War]]) or conflicts mandated by the [[United Nations]].\n\n====Franco-Siamese War (1893)====\nWith the rapid expansion of the [[French Third Republic|French]] [[French colonial empire|Empire]] into [[Indochina]], conflicts necessarily occurred. War became inevitable when a French mission led by [[Auguste Pavie]] to King [[Chulalongkorn]] to try to bring [[Laos]] under French rule ended in failure. The French colonialists invaded Siam from the northeast and sent two warships to fight their way past the river forts and train their guns on the Grand Palace in [[Bangkok]] (the [[Paknam Incident]]). They also declared a blockade of Bangkok, which almost brought them into conflict with the British Navy. Siam was forced to accept the French [[ultimatum]] and surrendered Laos to France, also allowing French troops to occupy the Thai province of [[Chantaburi]] for several decades.<ref>[http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2005/11/02/headlines/data/headlines_19040213.html Legacy of the Paknam clash] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090421214229/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2005/11/02/headlines/data/headlines_19040213.html |date=21 April 2009 }}. nationmultimedia.com. 2 November 2005</ref>\n\n[[Image:Firstworldwar.jpg|thumb|230px|right|The Siamese Expeditionary Force in Paris, 1919.]]\n\n====World War I (1917\u20131918)====\n{{main|Siam in World War I}}\n\nKing [[Vajiravudh]] on 22 July 1917 declared war on the [[Central Powers]] and joined the [[Entente Powers]] on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]].

By playing the British Empire against Japan, Prime Minister Phibunsongkhram was able to maintain a degree of neutrality for some time. However, this ended in the early hours of 8 December 1941, when Japan launched a [[Japanese invasion of Thailand|surprise attack]] on Thailand at nine places along the coastline and from French Indo-China. The greatly outnumbered Thai forces put up resistance, but were soon overwhelmed. By 07:30, Phibun ordered an end to hostilities, though resistance continued for at least another day until all units could be notified. Phibun signed an [[armistice]] with Japan that allowed the empire to move its troops through Thai territory. Impressed by Japan's easy defeat of the British military in Malaya, Phibun formally made Thailand part of the [[Axis powers|Axis]] by declaring war on the United Kingdom and the United States, though the Regent refused to sign it in the young king's name. (The Thai ambassador to Washington refused to deliver the declaration, and the United States continued to consider Thailand an occupied country.) An active and foreign-assisted underground resistance movement, the [[Free Thai]], was largely successful and helped Thailand to rehabilitate after the war and be treated as an occupied nation rather than a defeated enemy.<ref>[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+th0031) Thailand].

For example, most of the distinctive service uniforms were patterned on those of the US, but lower ranking enlisted navy personnel wear uniforms resembling those of their French counterparts. The early influence of British advisers to the Thai royal court and the historical role of the military in royal pomp and ceremony contributed to the splendor of formal dress uniforms worn by high-ranking officers and guards of honour on ceremonial occasions.\n\n[[File:Royal Thai Army Band in the royal guard dress.jpg|thumb|230px|The [[Royal Thai Army]] Band in uniforms of various [[King's Guard (Thailand)|royal guards]] unit, ranked in the shape of the [[flag of Thailand]]]]\n\nThe rank structures of the three armed services are similar to those of the respective branches of the US Armed Forces, although the Thai system has fewer NCO and warrant officer designations. The king, as head of state and constitutional head of the armed forces, commissions all officers. Appointments to NCO ranks are authorised by the minister of defence. In theory, the authority and responsibilities of officers of various ranks correspond to those of their US counterparts. However, because of a perennial surplus of senior officers\u2014in 1987 there were some 600 generals and admirals in a total force of about 273,000\u2014Thai staff positions are often held by officers of higher rank than would be the case in the US or other Western military establishments.\n\nThai military personnel are highly conscious of rank distinctions and of the duties, obligations, and benefits they entail. Relationships among officers of different grades and among officers, NCOs, and the enlisted ranks are governed by military tradition in a society where observance of differences in status are highly formalised. The social distance between officers and NCOs is widened by the fact that officers usually are college or military academy graduates, while most NCOs have not gone beyond secondary school. There is a wider gap between officers and conscripts, most of whom have even less formal education, service experience, or specialised training.\n\nFormal honours and symbols of merit occupy an important place in Thai military tradition. The government grants numerous awards, and outstanding acts of heroism, courage, and meritorious service receive prompt recognition.\n\n===Officer and enlisted rank insignia===\n{| style=\"border:1px solid #8888aa; background-color:#f7f8ff; padding:5px; font-size:95%; margin: 0px 12px 12px 0px;\"\n{{Ranks and Insignia of Non NATO Armies/OF/Blank}}\n{{Ranks and Insignia of Non NATO Armies/OF/Thailand}}\n{{Ranks and Insignia of Non NATO Navies/OF/Thailand}}\n{{Ranks and Insignia of Non NATO Air Forces/OF/Thailand}}\n|}\n{| style=\"border:1px solid #8888aa; background-color:#f7f8ff; padding:5px; font-size:95%; margin: 0px 12px 12px 0px;\"\n{{Ranks and Insignia of Non NATO Armies/OR/Blank}}\n{{Ranks and insignia of Non NATO Armies/OR/Thailand}}\n{{Ranks and Insignia of Non NATO Navies/OR/Thailand}}\n{{Ranks and Insignia of Non NATO Air Forces/OR/Thailand}}\n|}\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nFile:Thai soldiers and Type 85 APCs during 2010 Thai political protests.jpg|RTA troops take cover next to a [[Type 85 AFV]] near the Red Shirt barricade at [[Chulalongkorn Hospital]]\nFile:2010 0513 silom 11.JPG|Soldiers with riot shields at a barricade on [[Silom Road]] and Soi Convent\nFile:2010 0513 saladaeng station 02.JPG|Soldiers beneath Saladaeng BTS station, Silom Road\nFile:2010 0513 silom 07.JPG|Soldiers and a helmeted journalist buy water and food, Silom Road\nFile:2014 0526 Thailand coup Chang Phueak Gate Chiang Mai 02.jpg|Troops at Chang Phueak Gate, [[Chiang Mai]], days after the [[2014 Thai coup d'\u00e9tat]]\nFile:2014 0526 Thailand coup Chang Phueak Gate Chiang Mai 01.jpg|Troops at Chang Phueak Gate, Chiang Mai\nFile:Defense.gov News Photo 110211-M-VX252-046 - Royal Thai and U.S. Marines discuss how to eliminate hostile forces firing on them from a building during a mock mechanized raid on Feb. 11 2011.jpg|[[Royal Thai Marine Corps|Royal Thai]] and [[US Marines]] eliminating hostile forces during a mock raid, 11 February 2011\nFile:USMC-110213-M-GT770-027.jpg|Royal Thai Special Forces service member clears a building during a mock raid, [[Cobra Gold]], 2011\nFile:USMC-110213-M-GT770-017.jpg|Royal Thai Special Forces clear a building during a mock raid, Cobra Gold, 2011\nFile:Thai service members participate in a rivierine subject matter expert exchange with U.S. Sailors in the Nakhon Nayok River as part of Cooperation Afloat Readiness and Training (CARAT) 2013 in Thailand June 8 130608-N-RG360-224.jpg|Thai troops in a riverine exercise with US sailors on the Nakhon Nayok River, [[Cooperation Afloat Readiness and Training]] (CARAT), 8 June 2013\nFile:Rtaf All FlighterJet.jpg|RTAF fighters: [[JAS 39 Gripen]], [[F-16|F-16 ADF]], [[Northrop F-5|F-5]], [[Alpha jet]], [[Aero L-39 Albatros|L-39]] and [[SAAB-340]]\nFile:HTMS Naresuan in Hong Kong.JPG|RTN frigate [[HTMS Naresuan]] FFG-421 moored in [[Victoria Harbour]], Hong Kong\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Border Patrol Police]]\n* [[King's Guard (Thailand)]]\n* [[List of flags of the Royal Thai Armed Forces]]\n* [[Military ranks of the Thai armed forces]]\n* [[Royal Thai Air Force]]\n* [[Royal Thai Police]]\n* [[Territorial Defence Student]]\n* [[Thahan Phran]]\n* [[Underwater Demolition Assault Unit]]\n* [[Volunteer Defense Corps (Thailand)]]\n\n==References==\n{{loc}}\n{{reflist|35em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Osornprasop, Sutayut. \"Thailand and the Secret War in Laos\", 1960\u20131974 (in) Albert Lau (ed.), ''Southeast Asia and the Cold War''.

He is one of the prominent representatives of the \"[[Bongo Flava]]\" Tanzanian hip hop subgenre, which mixes elements from both Western hip hop and the Tanzanian tradition (including [[swahili language|swahili]] lyrics as well as an activist attitude towards Tanzanian social issues such as [[HIV]]/AIDS, wealth, inequality, and political corruption).<ref>[http://www.afropop.org/explore/album_review/ID/2604/Bongo+Flava:+Swahili+Rap+from+Tanzania Bongo Flava: Swahili Rap from Tanzania<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051217023910/http://www.afropop.org/explore/album_review/ID/2604/Bongo+Flava%3A+Swahili+Rap+From+Tanzania |date=2005-12-17 }}</ref>\n\n== Biography ==\nHe started rapping in 1989 as a member of the group Hard Blasters, best known for their hit \"Chemsha Bongo\" (then he used stage name ''Nigga J'') from their first album, \"Funga Kazi\".

The song continues with a chorus saying the words \"Ndio Mzee\" which means \"Yes Sir\".  This represents the brainwashing of the public as politicians make these false promises over and over.
