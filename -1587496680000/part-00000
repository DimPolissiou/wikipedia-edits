The battle was fought on 12 April 1782 off the east coast of [[Ceylon]], near a rocky islet called Providien, south of [[Trincomalee]].<ref name=cunat128>Cunat, p.128</ref>\n\n==Background==\n\nIn 1778, France had entered the [[American Revolutionary War]]; and in 1780 Britain declared war on the [[Dutch Republic]] after the Dutch refused to stop trading military supplies with France and America. The British had rapidly gained control over most French and Dutch outposts in India when news of these events reached India, spawning the [[Second Anglo-Mysore War]] in the process.\n\nIn March 1781, French Admiral [[Pierre Andre de Suffren Saint Tropez|Bailli de Suffren]] was dispatched on a mission to provide military assistance to French colonies in [[India]], leading a fleet of five ships, seven transports, and a corvette to escort the transports from [[Brest, France|Brest]]. After a [[Battle of Porto Praya|happenstance battle]] with the British fleet at [[Porto Praya]] in the [[Cape Verde Islands]] in April, the French fleet stopped at the Dutch-controlled [[Cape of Good Hope]] in October. Troops were left to assist the Dutch in defence of that colony while the fleet was reinforced by additional ships with command transferred to the elderly Admiral [[Thomas d'Estienne d'Orves]]. The French fleet sailed on to \u00cele de France (now [[Mauritius]]), arriving at [[Port Louis, Mauritius|Port Louis]] in December. They then sailed for India with transports that carried nearly 3,000 men under the command of the Comte du Chemin. D'Orves died in February 1782, shortly before the fleet arrived off the Indian coast, and Suffren resumed command.\n\nSuffren first sailed for [[Chennai|Madras]], hoping to surprise the British stronghold. When he found the fleet of [[Edward Hughes (admiral)|Sir Edward Hughes]] anchored there on 15 February 1782, he turned south with the intent of landing troops at [[Parangipettai|Porto Novo]], hoping to march up the coast and recapture French and Dutch holdings on the way. Hughes raised anchor and sailed after Suffren. In the [[Battle of Sadras]], both fleets suffered damage without loss of ships, but the French were able to safely land troops at Porto Novo to assist the Mysoreans. Suffren made repairs to his fleet at [[Pondicherry (city)|Pondicherry]] after that battle; on 23 February, he sailed out to find Hughes, who had gone to [[Trincomalee]] for repairs.\n\nOn 8 April, Hughes' fleet was spotted heading for Trincomalee. Suffren gave chase, but was unable to close for three days. Hughes had to change course on 12 April to continue toward Trincomalee, which gave Suffren the advantage of the wind.\n\n==Battle==\nThe battle lines engaged at about 12:30&nbsp;pm.  Initially, some of Suffren's captains hesitated, not immediately joining in the line (as had also happened at Sadras), but eventually ten of his twelve ships were engaged against the eleven British ships.  ''[[HMS Monmouth (1772)|Monmouth]]'' was the first ship to quit the British line after being dismasted, and ''Superb'' also suffered significant damage in the early rounds.  Hughes was able to regain advantage by ordering his fleet to [[Jibe (sailing)|wear ship]], and the battle began to turn against the French.  Around 6&nbsp;pm, a storm arose; the combatants, close to a [[lee shore]], broke off the battle to attend to the risks the storm presented. Darkness from the storm and then nightfall precluded further battle that day.\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe fleets had anchored near enough to each other that Suffren again positioned for battle. Hughes, however, had a convoy to protect, and sailed for Trincomalee. Suffren sailed south and anchored at [[Batticaloa]], which was still under Dutch control, where he spent six weeks for repairs and resupply. While there, he received orders to sail to \u00cele de France (Mauritius) to escort another troop convoy. Suffren chose to disregard this order, as the risk posed by Hughes to French operations required his full strength, and he could not trust his captains. The captains of ''Vengeur'' and ''Art\u00e9sien'', the two ships that stayed out of the action, were reported for their failure to obey orders, and his second-in-command was intriguing with some of the other captains against him.\n\n== Order of battle ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top;\"\n!colspan=\"11\" bgcolor=\"white\"|French

The battle was fought on 12 April 1782 off the east coast of [[Ceylon]], near a rocky islet called Providien, south of [[Trincomalee]].<ref name=cunat128>Cunat, p.128</ref>\n\n==Background==\n\nIn 1778, France had entered the [[American Revolutionary War]]; and in 1780 Britain declared war on the [[Dutch Republic]] after the Dutch refused to stop trading military supplies with France and America. The British had rapidly gained control over most French and Dutch outposts in India when news of these events reached India, spawning the [[Second Anglo-Mysore War]] in the process.\n\nIn March 1781, French Admiral [[Pierre Andre de Suffren Saint Tropez|Bailli de Suffren]] was dispatched on a mission to provide military assistance to French colonies in [[India]], leading a fleet of five ships, seven transports, and a corvette to escort the transports from [[Brest, France|Brest]]. After a [[Battle of Porto Praya|happenstance battle]] with the British fleet at [[Porto Praya]] in the [[Cape Verde Islands]] in April, the French fleet stopped at the Dutch-controlled [[Cape of Good Hope]] in October. Troops were left to assist the Dutch in defence of that colony while the fleet was reinforced by additional ships with command transferred to the elderly Admiral [[Thomas d'Estienne d'Orves]]. The French fleet sailed on to \u00cele de France (now [[Mauritius]]), arriving at [[Port Louis, Mauritius|Port Louis]] in December. They then sailed for India with transports that carried nearly 3,000 men under the command of the Comte du Chemin. D'Orves died in February 1782, shortly before the fleet arrived off the Indian coast, and Suffren resumed command.\n\nSuffren first sailed for [[Chennai|Madras]], hoping to surprise the British stronghold. When he found the fleet of [[Edward Hughes (admiral)|Sir Edward Hughes]] anchored there on 15 February 1782, he turned south with the intent of landing troops at [[Parangipettai|Porto Novo]], hoping to march up the coast and recapture French and Dutch holdings on the way. Hughes raised anchor and sailed after Suffren. In the [[Battle of Sadras]], both fleets suffered damage without loss of ships, but the French were able to safely land troops at Porto Novo to assist the Mysoreans. Suffren made repairs to his fleet at [[Pondicherry (city)|Pondicherry]] after that battle; on 23 February, he sailed out to find Hughes, who had gone to [[Trincomalee]] for repairs.\n\nOn 8 April, Hughes' fleet was spotted heading for Trincomalee. Suffren gave chase, but was unable to close for three days. Hughes had to change course on 12 April to continue toward Trincomalee, which gave Suffren the advantage of the wind.\n\n==Battle==\nThe battle lines engaged at about 12:30&nbsp;pm.  Initially, some of Suffren's captains hesitated, not immediately joining in the line (as had also happened at Sadras), but eventually ten of his twelve ships were engaged against the eleven British ships.  ''[[HMS Monmouth (1772)|Monmouth]]'' was the first ship to quit the British line after being dismasted, and ''Superb'' also suffered significant damage in the early rounds.  Hughes was able to regain advantage by ordering his fleet to [[Jibe (sailing)|wear ship]], and the battle began to turn against the French.  Around 6&nbsp;pm, a storm arose; the combatants, close to a [[lee shore]], broke off the battle to attend to the risks the storm presented. Darkness from the storm and then nightfall precluded further battle that day.\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe fleets had anchored near enough to each other that Suffren again positioned for battle. Hughes, however, had a convoy to protect, and sailed for Trincomalee. Suffren sailed south and anchored at [[Batticaloa]], which was still under Dutch control, where he spent six weeks for repairs and resupply. While there, he received orders to sail to \u00cele de France (Mauritius) to escort another troop convoy. Suffren chose to disregard this order, as the risk posed by Hughes to French operations required his full strength, and he could not trust his captains. The captains of ''Vengeur'' and ''Art\u00e9sien'', the two ships that stayed out of the action, were reported for their failure to obey orders, and his second-in-command was intriguing with some of the other captains against him.\n\n== Order of battle ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top;\"\n!colspan=\"11\" bgcolor=\"white\"|Captain

It is the capital of the [[Loiret]] [[Departments of France|department]] and of the [[Centre-Val de Loire]] [[Regions of France|region]].\n\nOrl\u00e9ans is located on the [[Loire River]] where the river curves south towards the [[Massif Central]]. In 2015, the city had 114,644 inhabitants, and the population of the urban area was 433,337. \n[[\u00cele d'Orl\u00e9ans]] in Quebec, Canada is named after Orleans in France as are [[Orl\u00e9ans, Ontario]] and [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]]. (French: ''La Nouvelle-Orl\u00e9ans'')\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Orl\u00e9ans Pont George V 01.jpg|thumb|left|[[George V Bridge, Orl\u00e9ans|Pont George-V]]|270px]]\n[[File:ORLEANS From Flight ORY-MAD 737 EC-LQX (7951291066).jpg|thumb|left|Orl\u00e9ans from above|270px]]\nOrl\u00e9ans is located in the northern bend of the [[Loire]], which crosses from east to west. Orl\u00e9ans belongs to the [[Loire Valley|vall\u00e9e de la Loire]] sector between [[Sully-sur-Loire]] and [[Chalonnes-sur-Loire]], which was in 2000 inscribed by [[UNESCO]] as a [[World Heritage site|World Heritage Site]]. The capital of [[Orl\u00e9anais]], 120 kilometres southwest of Paris, is bordered to the north by the [[Beauce, France|Beauce]] region, more specifically the [[Forest of Orl\u00e9ans|Orl\u00e9ans Forest]] (French: ''for\u00eat d'Orl\u00e9ans'') and Orl\u00e9ans-la-Source neighbourhood, and the [[Sologne]] region to the south.\n\nFive bridges in the city cross the Loire River: Pont de l'Europe, Pont du Mar\u00e9chal Joffre (also called Pont Neuf), [[George V Bridge, Orl\u00e9ans|Pont George-V]] (also called Pont Royal, carrying the commune [[trams|tramway]]), Pont Ren\u00e9-Thinat and Pont de Vierzon (rail bridge).\n\nTo the north of the Loire (''rive droite'') is to be found a small hill ({{Convert|102|m|abbr=on}} at the pont Georges-V, {{Convert|110|m|abbr=on}} at the Place du Martroi) which gently rises to {{Convert|125|m|abbr=on}} at la Croix Fleury, at the limits of [[Fleury-les-Aubrais]]. Conversely, the south (on the ''rive gauche'') has a gentle [[depression (geology)|depression]] to about {{Convert|95|m|abbr=on}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]] (at Saint-Marceau) between the Loire and the Loiret, designated a \"zone inondable\" (flood-risk zone).\n\nAt the end of the 1960s, the Orl\u00e9ans-la-Source neighbourhood was created, {{Convert|12|km|mi|0}}to the south of the original commune and separated from it by the Val d'Orl\u00e9ans and the [[Loiret River]] (whose source is in the [[Parc Floral de la Source]]). This quarter's altitude varies from about {{Convert|100|to|110|m|abbr=on}}.\n\n===The Loire and navigation===\nIn Orl\u00e9ans, the Loire is separated by a submerged [[dike (construction)|dike]] known as the ''dhuis'' into the ''Grande Loire'' to the north, no longer navigable, and the ''Petite Loire'' to the south. This dike is just one part of a vast system of construction that previously allowed the Loire to remain navigable to this point.\n\nThe Loire was formerly an important navigation and trading route. With the increase in size of ocean-going ships, large ships can now navigate the [[estuary]] only up to about [[Nantes]].\n\nBoats on the river were traditionally flat-bottomed boats, with large but foldable masts so the sails could gather wind from above the river banks, but the masts could be lowered in order to allow the boats to pass under bridges. these vessels are known as ''gabarre,'' ''futreau,'' and so on, and may be viewed by tourists near pont Royal.\n\nThe river's irregular flow strongly limits traffic on it, in particular at its ascent, though this can be overcome by boats being given a tow.\n[[File:La Loire \u00e0 Orl\u00e9ans.jpg|thumb|The Loire as it flows through Orl\u00e9ans|400px]]\nAn ''Inexplosible''-type paddle steamer owned by the mairie was put in place in August 2007, facing Place de la Loire and containing a bar.\n\nEvery two years, the Festival de Loire recalls the role played by the river in the commune's history.\n\nOn the river's north bank, near the town centre, is the [[Canal d'Orl\u00e9ans]], which connects to the [[Canal du Loing]] and the [[Canal de Briare]] at [[Buges]] near [[Montargis]]. The canal is no longer used along its whole length. Its route within Orl\u00e9ans runs parallel to the river, separated from it by a wall or ''muret'', with a promenade along the top. Its last [[canal pound|pound]] was transformed into an outdoor swimming pool in the 1960s, then filled in. It was reopened in 2007 for the \"f\u00eates de Loire.\" There are plans to revive use of the canal for recreation and install a pleasure-boat port there.\n\n===Climate===\nOrl\u00e9ans experiences an [[oceanic climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Cfb''), similar to much of central France.\n\n{{Orl\u00e9ans weatherbox}}\n\n==History==\n{{see also|Timeline of Orl\u00e9ans}}\n\n===Prehistory and Roman Empire===\n:''See also [[Cenabum]], Aureliana Civitas.''\n'''Cenabum''' was a [[Gauls|Gallic]] stronghold, one of the principal towns of the tribe of the [[Carnutes]] where the [[Druid]]s held their annual assembly. The [[Carnutes]] were massacred and the city was destroyed by [[Julius Caesar]] in 52 BC,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0001:book=7:chapter=28|title=C. Julius Caesar, Gallic War, Book 7, chapter 28|website=www.perseus.tufts.edu|access-date=2018-02-16}}</ref> then a new city was built on its ruins by settlers from the [[Aurelia (gens)|gens Aurelia]] who named the city, '''civitas Aurelianorum''' (\"city of the Aurelii\"), after themselves. The name later evolved into Orl\u00e9ans.<ref>For an exact etymology, see ''Cenabum, Aurelianis, Orl\u00e9ans'' de Jacques Debal (Coll. Galliae civitates, Lyon, PUL, 1996)</ref>\n\nIn 442 Flavius Aetius, the Roman commander in Gaul, requested [[Goar]], head of the [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] tribe of [[Alans]] in the region to come to Orleans and control the rebellious natives and the Visigoths. Accompanying the [[Vandals]], the Alans crossed the Loire in 408. One of their groups, under [[Goar]], joined the Roman forces of [[Flavius Aetius]] to fight [[Attila]] when he invaded Gaul in 451, taking part in the [[Battle of Ch\u00e2lons]] under their king [[Sangiban]]. Goar established his capital in Orl\u00e9ans. His successors later took possession of the estates in the region between Orl\u00e9ans and Paris. Installed in Orl\u00e9ans and along the Loire, they were unruly (killing the town's senators when they felt they had been paid too slowly or too little) and resented by the local inhabitants. Many inhabitants around the present city have names bearing witness to the Alan presence \u2013 Allaines. Also many places in the region bear names of Alan origin.<ref>[http://www.marres.education/alans.htm marres.education]. Accessed January 2016.</ref>\n\n===Early Middle Ages===\nIn the [[Merovingian]] era, the city was capital of the Kingdom of Orl\u00e9ans following [[Clovis I]]'s division of the kingdom, then under the [[House of Capet|Capetian]]s it became the capital of a [[Count of Orl\u00e9ans|county]] then [[Duke of Orl\u00e9ans|duchy]] held in [[appanage]] by the house of [[duke of Orl\u00e9ans|Valois-Orl\u00e9ans]]. The Valois-Orl\u00e9ans family later acceded to the throne of France via [[Louis XII]] then [[Francis I of France|Francis I]]. In 1108, one of the few consecrations of a French monarch to occur outside of [[Reims]] occurred at Orl\u00e9ans, when [[Louis VI of France]] was consecrated in [[Orl\u00e9ans cathedral]] by [[Daimbert, Archbishop of Sens|Daimbert]], [[archbishop of Sens]].\n\n===High Middle Ages===\n[[File:View of Orl\u00e9ans 1428 - Project Gutenberg etext 19488.jpg|thumb|left|Orl\u00e9ans in September 1428, the time of the [[Siege of Orl\u00e9ans]].]]\nThe city was always a strategic point on the Loire, for it was sited at the river's most northerly point, and thus its closest point to Paris. There were few bridges over the dangerous [[river Loire]], but Orl\u00e9ans had one of them, and so became \u2013 with [[Rouen]] and Paris \u2013 one of medieval France's three richest cities.\n[[File:Vigiles du roi Charles VII 18.JPG|thumbnail|250px|15th-century depiction of the French troops attacking an English fort at the siege of Orl\u00e9ans]]\nOn the south bank the \"[[Fortress|ch\u00e2telet]] des Tourelles\" protected access to the bridge. This was the site of the [[Siege of Orl\u00e9ans|battle]] on 8 May 1429 which allowed [[Joan of Arc]] to enter and lift the siege of the [[Plantagenets]] during the [[Hundred Years' War]], with the help of the royal generals [[Jean de Dunois|Dunois]] and Florent d'[[Illiers-Combray|Illiers]]. The city's inhabitants have continued to remain faithful and grateful to her to this day, calling her \"la pucelle d'Orl\u00e9ans\" (the maid of Orl\u00e9ans), offering her a middle-class house in the city, and contributing to her ransom when she was taken prisoner.\n[[File:Orleans Monument Joan of Arc.jpg|thumb|Statue of [[Joan of Arc]], Place du Martroi]]\n\n===1453 to 1699===\n[[File:1581-Aurelia Franciae civitas ad Ligeri flu.JPG|thumb|''Aurelia Franciae civitas ad Ligeri flu. sita'' (1581)]]\n[[File:H\u00f4tel Groslot, Orl\u00e9ans, France, 2012..JPG|thumb|The Renaissance H\u00f4tel Groslot]]\nOnce the [[Hundred Years' War]] was over, the city recovered its former prosperity. The bridge brought in tolls and taxes, as did the merchants passing through the city. King [[Louis XI]] also greatly contributed to its prosperity, revitalising agriculture in the surrounding area (particularly the exceptionally fertile land around [[Beauce, France|Beauce]]) and relaunching [[saffron]] farming at [[Pithiviers]]. Later, during the [[Renaissance]], the city benefited from its becoming fashionable for rich [[ch\u00e2telain]]s to travel along the Loire valley (a fashion begun by the king himself, whose royal domains included the nearby ch\u00e2teaus at [[Chambord, Loir-et-Cher|Chambord]], [[Amboise]], [[Blois]], and [[Ch\u00e2teau de Chenonceau|Chenonceau]]).\n\nThe [[University of Orl\u00e9ans]] also contributed to the city's prestige. Specializing in law, it was highly regarded throughout Europe. [[John Calvin]] was received and accommodated there (and wrote part of his reforming theses during his stay), and in return [[Henry VIII of England]] (who had drawn on Calvin's work in his separation from Rome) offered to fund a scholarship at the university. Many other Protestants were sheltered by the city. Jean-Baptiste Poquelin, better known by his pseudonym [[Moli\u00e8re]], also studied law at the University, but was expelled for attending a carnival contrary to university rules.\n\nFrom 13 December 1560 to 31 January 1561, the [[Estates General (France)|French States-General]] after the death of [[Francis II of France]], the eldest son of [[Catherine de M\u00e9dicis]] and [[Henry II of France|Henry II]]. He died in the H\u00f4tel Groslot in Orl\u00e9ans, with his queen [[Mary, Queen of Scots|Mary]] at his side.\n\nThe [[Orl\u00e9ans Cathedral|cathedral]] was rebuilt several times. The present structure had its first stone laid by [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]], and work on it took a century. It thus is a mix of late Renaissance and early [[Rococo|Louis XIV]] styles, and one of the last cathedrals to be built in France.\n\n===1700\u20131900===\nWhen France colonised America, the territory it conquered was immense, including the whole [[Mississippi River]] (whose first European name was the River [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert|Colbert]]), from its mouth to its source at the borders of Canada. Its capital was named ''[[New Orleans|la Nouvelle-Orl\u00e9ans]]'' in honour of [[Louis XV]]'s regent, the [[Philippe II, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans|duke of Orl\u00e9ans]], and was settled with French inhabitants against the threat from British troops to the north-east.\n\nThe Dukes of Orl\u00e9ans hardly ever visited their city since, as brothers or cousins of the king, they took such a major role in court life that they could hardly ever leave. The duchy of Orl\u00e9ans was the largest of the French duchies, starting at [[Arpajon]], continuing to [[Chartres]], [[Vend\u00f4me]], [[Blois]], [[Vierzon]], and [[Montargis]]. The duke's son bore the title ''duke of Chartres''. Inheritances from great families and marriage alliances allowed them to accumulate huge wealth, and one of them, [[Louis Philippe II, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans|Philippe \u00c9galit\u00e9]], is sometimes said to have been the richest man in the world at the time. His son, [[Louis-Philippe of France|Louis-Philippe I]], inherited the Penthi\u00e8vre and Cond\u00e9 family fortunes.\n\n1852 saw the creation of the ''Compagnies ferroviaires Paris-Orl\u00e9ans'' and its famous [[gare d'Orsay]] in Paris. In the [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870, the city again became strategically important thanks to its geographical position, and was occupied by the [[Prussia]]ns on 13 October that year. The ''[[arm\u00e9e de la Loire]]'' was formed under the orders of [[Louis d'Aurelle de Paladines|General d'Aurelle de Paladines]] and based itself not far from Orl\u00e9ans at [[Beauce, France|Beauce]].\n\n===1900 to present===\n[[File:US Army medics in Orleans, France 1944-08-19.JPEG|thumb|210px|US Army medics in Orl\u00e9ans, 1944]]\nDuring the [[Second World War]], the German army made the ''Orl\u00e9ans Fleury-les-Aubrais'' railway station one of their central logistical rail hubs. The Pont Georges V was renamed \"pont des Tourelles\".<ref>World-wide current events of 16 May 1941, available on the site of the [[Institut national de l'audiovisuel|INA]] ([http://www.ina.fr/archivespourtous/index.php?vue=notice&id_notice=AFE85000506 direct link]).</ref> A transit camp for deportees was built at [[Beaune-la-Rolande]]. During the Liberation, the American Air Force heavily bombed the city and the train station, causing much damage. The city was one of the first to be rebuilt after the war: the reconstruction plan and city improvement initiated by Jean K\u00e9risel and Jean Royer was adopted as early as 1943, and work began as early as the start of 1945. This reconstruction in part identically reproduced what had been lost, such as Royale and its arcades, but also used innovative prefabrication techniques, such as \u00eelot 4 under the direction of the architect [[Pol Abraham]].<ref>Joseph Abram, ''L'architecture moderne en France, du chaos \u00e0 la croissance'', tome 2, \u00e9d. Picard, 1999, pp. 28 et 37\u201338</ref>\n\nThe big city of former times is today an average-sized city of 250,000 inhabitants. It is still using its strategically central position less than an hour from the French capital to attract businesses interested in reducing transport costs.\n\n===Heraldry===\n\nAccording to [[Victor Adolphe Malte-Brun]] in ''La France Illustr\u00e9e'', 1882, Orl\u00e9ans's arms are \"[[gules]], three caillous in ''c\u0153urs de lys'' [[argent]], and on a chief [[Azure (heraldry)|azure]], three fleurs de lys [[or (heraldry)|Or]].\"  Charle Grandmaison, in the ''Dictionnaire H\u00e9raldique'' of 1861, states that it is \"Or, with three hearts in gules\", without the chief of France. Sometimes, in faulty designs, we find it described \"gules, three fleurs de lys argent, and on a chief azure three fleurs de lys Or.\"<ref>[[Grand Larousse encyclop\u00e9dique]] in 10 volumes, 163</ref>\n\nThe design shown left shows 3 \"c\u0153urs de lys\" (heart of a lily), seen from above. This \"c\u0153urs de lys\" is therefore not a true lily, which would have 6 [[tepal]]s, but a hypothetical aerial view of a symbolic lily. It has probably also been stylised more and more in heraldry, as in the heart in a pack of cards. Certain authors solve the problem by calling this symbol a \"[[tiercefeuille]]\", defined as a stemless [[clover]] leaf, with one leaf at the top and two below, thus making this coat of arms \"gules, with three reversed tiercefeuilles in argent, etc\".\n\n===Motto===\n\"Hoc vernant lilia corde\" (granted by [[Louis XII]], then [[duke of Orl\u00e9ans]]), meaning \"It is by this heart that lilies flourish\" or \"This heart makes lilies flourish\", referring to the [[fleur de lys]], symbol of the French royal family.\n\n==Transport==\n\n===Public transport===\nTAO manages buses and tram lines in Orl\u00e9ans.

The historical center dating back to the 15th century extends far beyond the limits of the pedestrian sector that has been extensively restored in the past few years. In fact it corresponds to the portion of the modern city which is enclosed by the Boulevards.

southwest of [[Paris]]. It is the capital of the [[Loiret]] [[Departments of France|department]] and of the [[Centre-Val de Loire]] [[Regions of France|region]].\n\nOrl\u00e9ans is located on the [[Loire River]] where the river curves south towards the [[Massif Central]]. In 2015, the city had 114,644 inhabitants, and the population of the urban area was 433,337. \n[[\u00cele d'Orl\u00e9ans]] in Quebec, Canada is named after Orleans in France as are [[Orl\u00e9ans, Ontario]] and [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]]. (French: ''La Nouvelle-Orl\u00e9ans'')\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Orl\u00e9ans Pont George V 01.jpg|thumb|left|[[George V Bridge, Orl\u00e9ans|Pont George-V]]|270px]]\n[[File:ORLEANS From Flight ORY-MAD 737 EC-LQX (7951291066).jpg|thumb|left|Orl\u00e9ans from above|270px]]\nOrl\u00e9ans is located in the northern bend of the [[Loire]], which crosses from east to west. Orl\u00e9ans belongs to the [[Loire Valley|vall\u00e9e de la Loire]] sector between [[Sully-sur-Loire]] and [[Chalonnes-sur-Loire]], which was in 2000 inscribed by [[UNESCO]] as a [[World Heritage site|World Heritage Site]]. The capital of [[Orl\u00e9anais]], 120 kilometres southwest of Paris, is bordered to the north by the [[Beauce, France|Beauce]] region, more specifically the [[Forest of Orl\u00e9ans|Orl\u00e9ans Forest]] (French: ''for\u00eat d'Orl\u00e9ans'') and Orl\u00e9ans-la-Source neighbourhood, and the [[Sologne]] region to the south.\n\nFive bridges in the city cross the Loire River: Pont de l'Europe, Pont du Mar\u00e9chal Joffre (also called Pont Neuf), [[George V Bridge, Orl\u00e9ans|Pont George-V]] (also called Pont Royal, carrying the commune [[trams|tramway]]), Pont Ren\u00e9-Thinat and Pont de Vierzon (rail bridge).\n\nTo the north of the Loire (''rive droite'') is to be found a small hill ({{Convert|102|m|abbr=on}} at the pont Georges-V, {{Convert|110|m|abbr=on}} at the Place du Martroi) which gently rises to {{Convert|125|m|abbr=on}} at la Croix Fleury, at the limits of [[Fleury-les-Aubrais]]. Conversely, the south (on the ''rive gauche'') has a gentle [[depression (geology)|depression]] to about {{Convert|95|m|abbr=on}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]] (at Saint-Marceau) between the Loire and the Loiret, designated a \"zone inondable\" (flood-risk zone).\n\nAt the end of the 1960s, the Orl\u00e9ans-la-Source neighbourhood was created, {{Convert|12|km|mi|0}}to the south of the original commune and separated from it by the Val d'Orl\u00e9ans and the [[Loiret River]] (whose source is in the [[Parc Floral de la Source]]). This quarter's altitude varies from about {{Convert|100|to|110|m|abbr=on}}.\n\n===The Loire and navigation===\nIn Orl\u00e9ans, the Loire is separated by a submerged [[dike (construction)|dike]] known as the ''dhuis'' into the ''Grande Loire'' to the north, no longer navigable, and the ''Petite Loire'' to the south. This dike is just one part of a vast system of construction that previously allowed the Loire to remain navigable to this point.\n\nThe Loire was formerly an important navigation and trading route. With the increase in size of ocean-going ships, large ships can now navigate the [[estuary]] only up to about [[Nantes]].\n\nBoats on the river were traditionally flat-bottomed boats, with large but foldable masts so the sails could gather wind from above the river banks, but the masts could be lowered in order to allow the boats to pass under bridges. these vessels are known as ''gabarre,'' ''futreau,'' and so on, and may be viewed by tourists near pont Royal.\n\nThe river's irregular flow strongly limits traffic on it, in particular at its ascent, though this can be overcome by boats being given a tow.\n[[File:La Loire \u00e0 Orl\u00e9ans.jpg|thumb|The Loire as it flows through Orl\u00e9ans|400px]]\nAn ''Inexplosible''-type paddle steamer owned by the mairie was put in place in August 2007, facing Place de la Loire and containing a bar.\n\nEvery two years, the Festival de Loire recalls the role played by the river in the commune's history.\n\nOn the river's north bank, near the town centre, is the [[Canal d'Orl\u00e9ans]], which connects to the [[Canal du Loing]] and the [[Canal de Briare]] at [[Buges]] near [[Montargis]]. The canal is no longer used along its whole length. Its route within Orl\u00e9ans runs parallel to the river, separated from it by a wall or ''muret'', with a promenade along the top. Its last [[canal pound|pound]] was transformed into an outdoor swimming pool in the 1960s, then filled in. It was reopened in 2007 for the \"f\u00eates de Loire.\" There are plans to revive use of the canal for recreation and install a pleasure-boat port there.\n\n===Climate===\nOrl\u00e9ans experiences an [[oceanic climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Cfb''), similar to much of central France.\n\n{{Orl\u00e9ans weatherbox}}\n\n==History==\n{{see also|Timeline of Orl\u00e9ans}}\n\n===Prehistory and Roman Empire===\n:''See also [[Cenabum]], Aureliana Civitas.''\n'''Cenabum''' was a [[Gauls|Gallic]] stronghold, one of the principal towns of the tribe of the [[Carnutes]] where the [[Druid]]s held their annual assembly. The [[Carnutes]] were massacred and the city was destroyed by [[Julius Caesar]] in 52 BC,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0001:book=7:chapter=28|title=C. Julius Caesar, Gallic War, Book 7, chapter 28|website=www.perseus.tufts.edu|access-date=2018-02-16}}</ref> then a new city was built on its ruins by settlers from the [[Aurelia (gens)|gens Aurelia]] who named the city, '''civitas Aurelianorum''' (\"city of the Aurelii\"), after themselves. The name later evolved into Orl\u00e9ans.<ref>For an exact etymology, see ''Cenabum, Aurelianis, Orl\u00e9ans'' de Jacques Debal (Coll. Galliae civitates, Lyon, PUL, 1996)</ref>\n\nIn 442 Flavius Aetius, the Roman commander in Gaul, requested [[Goar]], head of the [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] tribe of [[Alans]] in the region to come to Orleans and control the rebellious natives and the Visigoths. Accompanying the [[Vandals]], the Alans crossed the Loire in 408. One of their groups, under [[Goar]], joined the Roman forces of [[Flavius Aetius]] to fight [[Attila]] when he invaded Gaul in 451, taking part in the [[Battle of Ch\u00e2lons]] under their king [[Sangiban]]. Goar established his capital in Orl\u00e9ans. His successors later took possession of the estates in the region between Orl\u00e9ans and Paris. Installed in Orl\u00e9ans and along the Loire, they were unruly (killing the town's senators when they felt they had been paid too slowly or too little) and resented by the local inhabitants. Many inhabitants around the present city have names bearing witness to the Alan presence \u2013 Allaines. Also many places in the region bear names of Alan origin.<ref>[http://www.marres.education/alans.htm marres.education]. Accessed January 2016.</ref>\n\n===Early Middle Ages===\nIn the [[Merovingian]] era, the city was capital of the Kingdom of Orl\u00e9ans following [[Clovis I]]'s division of the kingdom, then under the [[House of Capet|Capetian]]s it became the capital of a [[Count of Orl\u00e9ans|county]] then [[Duke of Orl\u00e9ans|duchy]] held in [[appanage]] by the house of [[duke of Orl\u00e9ans|Valois-Orl\u00e9ans]]. The Valois-Orl\u00e9ans family later acceded to the throne of France via [[Louis XII]] then [[Francis I of France|Francis I]]. In 1108, one of the few consecrations of a French monarch to occur outside of [[Reims]] occurred at Orl\u00e9ans, when [[Louis VI of France]] was consecrated in [[Orl\u00e9ans cathedral]] by [[Daimbert, Archbishop of Sens|Daimbert]], [[archbishop of Sens]].\n\n===High Middle Ages===\n[[File:View of Orl\u00e9ans 1428 - Project Gutenberg etext 19488.jpg|thumb|left|Orl\u00e9ans in September 1428, the time of the [[Siege of Orl\u00e9ans]].]]\nThe city was always a strategic point on the Loire, for it was sited at the river's most northerly point, and thus its closest point to Paris. There were few bridges over the dangerous [[river Loire]], but Orl\u00e9ans had one of them, and so became \u2013 with [[Rouen]] and Paris \u2013 one of medieval France's three richest cities.\n[[File:Vigiles du roi Charles VII 18.JPG|thumbnail|250px|15th-century depiction of the French troops attacking an English fort at the siege of Orl\u00e9ans]]\nOn the south bank the \"[[Fortress|ch\u00e2telet]] des Tourelles\" protected access to the bridge. This was the site of the [[Siege of Orl\u00e9ans|battle]] on 8 May 1429 which allowed [[Joan of Arc]] to enter and lift the siege of the [[Plantagenets]] during the [[Hundred Years' War]], with the help of the royal generals [[Jean de Dunois|Dunois]] and Florent d'[[Illiers-Combray|Illiers]]. The city's inhabitants have continued to remain faithful and grateful to her to this day, calling her \"la pucelle d'Orl\u00e9ans\" (the maid of Orl\u00e9ans), offering her a middle-class house in the city, and contributing to her ransom when she was taken prisoner.\n[[File:Orleans Monument Joan of Arc.jpg|thumb|Statue of [[Joan of Arc]], Place du Martroi]]\n\n===1453 to 1699===\n[[File:1581-Aurelia Franciae civitas ad Ligeri flu.JPG|thumb|''Aurelia Franciae civitas ad Ligeri flu. sita'' (1581)]]\n[[File:H\u00f4tel Groslot, Orl\u00e9ans, France, 2012..JPG|thumb|The Renaissance H\u00f4tel Groslot]]\nOnce the [[Hundred Years' War]] was over, the city recovered its former prosperity. The bridge brought in tolls and taxes, as did the merchants passing through the city. King [[Louis XI]] also greatly contributed to its prosperity, revitalising agriculture in the surrounding area (particularly the exceptionally fertile land around [[Beauce, France|Beauce]]) and relaunching [[saffron]] farming at [[Pithiviers]]. Later, during the [[Renaissance]], the city benefited from its becoming fashionable for rich [[ch\u00e2telain]]s to travel along the Loire valley (a fashion begun by the king himself, whose royal domains included the nearby ch\u00e2teaus at [[Chambord, Loir-et-Cher|Chambord]], [[Amboise]], [[Blois]], and [[Ch\u00e2teau de Chenonceau|Chenonceau]]).\n\nThe [[University of Orl\u00e9ans]] also contributed to the city's prestige. Specializing in law, it was highly regarded throughout Europe. [[John Calvin]] was received and accommodated there (and wrote part of his reforming theses during his stay), and in return [[Henry VIII of England]] (who had drawn on Calvin's work in his separation from Rome) offered to fund a scholarship at the university. Many other Protestants were sheltered by the city. Jean-Baptiste Poquelin, better known by his pseudonym [[Moli\u00e8re]], also studied law at the University, but was expelled for attending a carnival contrary to university rules.\n\nFrom 13 December 1560 to 31 January 1561, the [[Estates General (France)|French States-General]] after the death of [[Francis II of France]], the eldest son of [[Catherine de M\u00e9dicis]] and [[Henry II of France|Henry II]]. He died in the H\u00f4tel Groslot in Orl\u00e9ans, with his queen [[Mary, Queen of Scots|Mary]] at his side.\n\nThe [[Orl\u00e9ans Cathedral|cathedral]] was rebuilt several times. The present structure had its first stone laid by [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]], and work on it took a century. It thus is a mix of late Renaissance and early [[Rococo|Louis XIV]] styles, and one of the last cathedrals to be built in France.\n\n===1700\u20131900===\nWhen France colonised America, the territory it conquered was immense, including the whole [[Mississippi River]] (whose first European name was the River [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert|Colbert]]), from its mouth to its source at the borders of Canada. Its capital was named ''[[New Orleans|la Nouvelle-Orl\u00e9ans]]'' in honour of [[Louis XV]]'s regent, the [[Philippe II, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans|duke of Orl\u00e9ans]], and was settled with French inhabitants against the threat from British troops to the north-east.\n\nThe Dukes of Orl\u00e9ans hardly ever visited their city since, as brothers or cousins of the king, they took such a major role in court life that they could hardly ever leave. The duchy of Orl\u00e9ans was the largest of the French duchies, starting at [[Arpajon]], continuing to [[Chartres]], [[Vend\u00f4me]], [[Blois]], [[Vierzon]], and [[Montargis]]. The duke's son bore the title ''duke of Chartres''. Inheritances from great families and marriage alliances allowed them to accumulate huge wealth, and one of them, [[Louis Philippe II, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans|Philippe \u00c9galit\u00e9]], is sometimes said to have been the richest man in the world at the time. His son, [[Louis-Philippe of France|Louis-Philippe I]], inherited the Penthi\u00e8vre and Cond\u00e9 family fortunes.\n\n1852 saw the creation of the ''Compagnies ferroviaires Paris-Orl\u00e9ans'' and its famous [[gare d'Orsay]] in Paris. In the [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870, the city again became strategically important thanks to its geographical position, and was occupied by the [[Prussia]]ns on 13 October that year. The ''[[arm\u00e9e de la Loire]]'' was formed under the orders of [[Louis d'Aurelle de Paladines|General d'Aurelle de Paladines]] and based itself not far from Orl\u00e9ans at [[Beauce, France|Beauce]].\n\n===1900 to present===\n[[File:US Army medics in Orleans, France 1944-08-19.JPEG|thumb|210px|US Army medics in Orl\u00e9ans, 1944]]\nDuring the [[Second World War]], the German army made the ''Orl\u00e9ans Fleury-les-Aubrais'' railway station one of their central logistical rail hubs. The Pont Georges V was renamed \"pont des Tourelles\".<ref>World-wide current events of 16 May 1941, available on the site of the [[Institut national de l'audiovisuel|INA]] ([http://www.ina.fr/archivespourtous/index.php?vue=notice&id_notice=AFE85000506 direct link]).</ref> A transit camp for deportees was built at [[Beaune-la-Rolande]]. During the Liberation, the American Air Force heavily bombed the city and the train station, causing much damage. The city was one of the first to be rebuilt after the war: the reconstruction plan and city improvement initiated by Jean K\u00e9risel and Jean Royer was adopted as early as 1943, and work began as early as the start of 1945. This reconstruction in part identically reproduced what had been lost, such as Royale and its arcades, but also used innovative prefabrication techniques, such as \u00eelot 4 under the direction of the architect [[Pol Abraham]].<ref>Joseph Abram, ''L'architecture moderne en France, du chaos \u00e0 la croissance'', tome 2, \u00e9d. Picard, 1999, pp. 28 et 37\u201338</ref>\n\nThe big city of former times is today an average-sized city of 250,000 inhabitants. It is still using its strategically central position less than an hour from the French capital to attract businesses interested in reducing transport costs.\n\n===Heraldry===\n\nAccording to [[Victor Adolphe Malte-Brun]] in ''La France Illustr\u00e9e'', 1882, Orl\u00e9ans's arms are \"[[gules]], three caillous in ''c\u0153urs de lys'' [[argent]], and on a chief [[Azure (heraldry)|azure]], three fleurs de lys [[or (heraldry)|Or]].\"  Charle Grandmaison, in the ''Dictionnaire H\u00e9raldique'' of 1861, states that it is \"Or, with three hearts in gules\", without the chief of France. Sometimes, in faulty designs, we find it described \"gules, three fleurs de lys argent, and on a chief azure three fleurs de lys Or.\"<ref>[[Grand Larousse encyclop\u00e9dique]] in 10 volumes, 163</ref>\n\nThe design shown left shows 3 \"c\u0153urs de lys\" (heart of a lily), seen from above. This \"c\u0153urs de lys\" is therefore not a true lily, which would have 6 [[tepal]]s, but a hypothetical aerial view of a symbolic lily. It has probably also been stylised more and more in heraldry, as in the heart in a pack of cards. Certain authors solve the problem by calling this symbol a \"[[tiercefeuille]]\", defined as a stemless [[clover]] leaf, with one leaf at the top and two below, thus making this coat of arms \"gules, with three reversed tiercefeuilles in argent, etc\".\n\n===Motto===\n\"Hoc vernant lilia corde\" (granted by [[Louis XII]], then [[duke of Orl\u00e9ans]]), meaning \"It is by this heart that lilies flourish\" or \"This heart makes lilies flourish\", referring to the [[fleur de lys]], symbol of the French royal family.\n\n==Transport==\n\n===Public transport===\nTAO manages buses and tram lines in Orl\u00e9ans.

Built between 1751 and 1760, at the request of [[Daniel-Charles Trudaine]], administrator and [[civil engineer]]. It was renamed in honour of [[King George V]] after the [[World War II]] out of respect of [[British Empire in World War II|Britain's role in the war]].\n* The ''Pont des Tourelles'', built in 1140 and demolished in 1760, was the first stone-made bridge of Orl\u00e9ans.

[[Napoleon|Napol\u00e9on]] stayed there. It is nowadays housing the international center for research, part of [[University of Orl\u00e9ans]]. \n* The courthouse (18th to 20th centuries)\n* The \"''salle de l'Institut''\", located on the \"place Sainte Croix\", is a small concert hall which can be converted in a ball room. Its acoustincs is remarkable\n* ''Mansions, rue de la Bretonnerie''. This street concentrates many particular mansions, of all styles and ages (15th to 20th centuries). High society members, politicians, barristers, doctors... continue to live there.\n* ''Mansions, rue d'Alsace-Lorraine'', 19th century bourgeoisie style houses.\n* Statue ''La Baigneuse'' by Paul Belmondo, aside the rue Royale (1955).\n* Statue of Calvin, by Daniel Leclercq, facing the Calvinist temple (2009).<ref>[http://www.bonnenouvelle.ch/20081112785/breves/les-francais-erigent-une-statue-de-calvin.html Les Fran\u00e7ais \u00e9rigent une statue de Calvin] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706222552/http://www.bonnenouvelle.ch/20081112785/breves/les-francais-erigent-une-statue-de-calvin.html |date=6 July 2011 }}, sur le site Bonnenouvelle.ch.</ref>\n* The ''FRAC Centre'' building named \"Les turbulences\", an advanced piece of architecture covered with L.E.Ds.\n\u2022 Many historical houses and mansions (hundreds) can still be admired in the city center which is one of the largest in France due to the great importance of the city until the 20th century. The historical center dating back to the 15th century extends far beyond the limits of the pedestrian sector that has been extensively restored in the past few years. In fact it corresponds to the portion of the modern city which is enclosed by the Boulevards. Many historical monuments remain in the non-pedestrian sectors of the city (for example, at rue Notre-Dame-de-Recouvrance, at rue des Carmes, at rue de la Bretonnerie, at Square Saint-Aignan).\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nEntr\u00e9e campo santo.jpg|Campo Santo.\nOrleans2.jpg|Place Sainte-Croix.\nH\u00f4pital_Orl\u00e9ans_Porte_Madeleine_01.jpg|<center>Hospital Madeleine.</center>\nOrl\u00e9ans_Tour_Blanche_1.jpg|<center>The White Tower.</center>\nOrl\u00e9ans_place_du_Ch\u00e2telet_2.jpg|<center>Old town.</center>\nOrl\u00e9ans_\u00e9glise_Saint-Paterne_1.jpg|<center>Saint-Paterne.</center>\nOrl\u00e9ans - cath\u00e9drale, ext\u00e9rieur (18).jpg|<center>Orl\u00e9ans Cathedral.</center>\nJoan of Arc statue, Place du Martroi, Orl\u00e9ans1.JPG|<center>Statue of Joan of Arc.</center>\n</gallery>\n\n===Museums===\nMuseums in Orl\u00e9ans:<ref>{{cite web|author=Patrice Gabin |url=http://www.tourisme-orleans.com/musees-orleans.php?id=27 |title=Orl\u00e9ans tourisme : mus\u00e9es \u00e0 Orl\u00e9ans (Orl\u00e9ans tourism: Museums in Orl\u00e9ans)|publisher=Web.archive.org |date=13 October 2007 |accessdate=6 April 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013041602/http://www.tourisme-orleans.com/musees-orleans.php?id=27 |archivedate=13 October 2007}}</ref>\n* [[Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts d'Orl\u00e9ans]]\n* [[Charles Peguy]] Centre\n* [[Joan of Arc]]'s House\n* Fine Arts Museum\n* City Historical and Archeological Museum\n* Natural Science Museum\n\n===Parks===\nParks in Orl\u00e9ans:<ref>{{cite web|author=Patrice Gabin |url=http://www.tourisme-orleans.com/parcs-jardins-orleans.php |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013134308/http://www.tourisme-orleans.com/parcs-jardins-orleans.php |archivedate=13 October 2007 |title=Park and Gardens in Orl\u00e9ans |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=13 October 2007 |accessdate=6 April 2011}}</ref>\n* [[Parc Floral de la Source]]\n* Motte Sanguin garden\n* Charpenterie garden\n* Botanic garden\n* Anjorrant park\n* Charbonni\u00e8re park\n* Moins Roux park\n* [[Louis Pasteur|Pasteur]] park\n\n===Media===\n* TV network: [http://www.orleanstv.fr/?id=910 Orl\u00e9ans TV]\n* Newspaper: [http://www.larep.com/accueil.html La R\u00e9publique du Centre] ''(the Republic of the Centre)''\n\n===Music===\n*Annual week-long classical music festival Semaines musicales internationales d'Orl\u00e9ans, founded in 1968.<ref>[https://www.idref.fr/05019691X \"Festivals de musique \u2013 France\"], Identifiants et r\u00e9f\u00e9rentials, retrieved 6 May 2018</ref>\n* [[Burning Heads]]\n\n===Sport===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2012}}\nOrl\u00e9ans has a [[basketball]] team: [[Orl\u00e9ans Loiret Basket]] which is in the [[Ligue Nationale de Basketball|French first division]].

To enhance mobility it was announced that the Army will receive the [[Agrale Marru\u00e1]] which appeared at the 25th Independence celebration parade in 2015 and are primarily used by the [[Namibian Special Forces]].<ref name=\"defenceweb.co.za\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.defenceweb.co.za/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=37339:namibia-defence-force-orders-marrua-vehicles&catid=50:Land&Itemid=105|title=Namibia Defence Force orders Marrua vehicles {{!}} defenceWeb|last=Martin|first=Guy|website=www.defenceweb.co.za|language=en-gb|access-date=2017-07-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150105132138/http://www.defenceweb.co.za/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=37339:namibia-defence-force-orders-marrua-vehicles&catid=50:Land&Itemid=105|archive-date=5 January 2015|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

As Viren informs Zafar that he will be extradited back to India for his crimes, Zafar's men enter his holding cell, led by '''Hamid Gul''' ([[Jaaved Jaffrey]]), killing all guards around them, with Zafar then killing Viren by shooting him and then burning him. As Zafar escapes in a helicopter waiting on the roof, he puts a $5&nbsp;million reward for someone to steal the [[Koh-i-Noor]] diamond from the [[Tower of London]], but with one condition \u2013 the thief must be Indian, to hold up a new extradition treaty between India and UK. Soon after, a man named '''Rajveer Nanda''' ([[Hrithik Roshan]]) steals it, and when Zafar's men, led by '''Shoaib Hakhsar''' ([[Ankur Vikal]]) are informed of the theft, they travel to Rajveer for the deal. Although they initially travel with the $5&nbsp;million reward, Rajveer informs them that he now wants $20&nbsp;million for the deal. Following the disdain of the comment made by Rajveer, a fight breaks out between Rajveer and Zafar's men after which Rajveer flies away. After Rajveer escapes, a CCTV footage of him is captured, showing that he is in [[Shimla]]. Following an escape, he sees a young lady, '''Harleen Sahni''' ([[Katrina Kaif]]) sitting in a restaurant, who is there waiting for her internet date, \"Vickie Kapoor\", to show up. Rajveer enters the restaurant posing as \"Vickie\" and woos her over. He convinces Harleen to use the bathroom and while she is in there, Rajveer fights the remaining men who came searching for him and leaves the restaurant, much to the dismay of Harleen. As she drives home, Harleen accidentally runs over Rajveer, who asks her to stitch up a gunshot wound sustained during the fight. Rajveer then gives Harleen drugged water, with her complying with what he says about a few government officials, informing her about where to find guns underneath some car seat and what they will say about him.\n\nThe next day indeed, some government officials led by '''Zorawar Sood''' ([[Pawan Malhotra]]) visit Harleen at her bank and threaten her to come with them. They tell her that if she does not accompany them, then they will reveal everything to her colleagues. Harleen decides to go with them to the police station. In the car, Zorawar tells her that they are not going to the station but they are taking her to a safe place instead. Harleen remembers about the gun that Rajveer had told her of. She engages the other official in small talk and finds the gun. She threatens both the officers to stop the car and let her go. At the same time, Rajveer appears on a bike and a chase sequence ensues. Both Rajveer and Harleen find a car and escape. When Rajveer goes out to shoot the goons, Harleen escapes and then bumps into her boss, Karan. She tells him about Rajveer and how random people are firing at her. Rajveer follows her. Karan tries to protect Harleen from Rajveer. He annoys Rajveer and gets shot by him in the leg. Harleen is exasperated but leaves with Rajveer again lest he shoots any more people.\n\nIn the car, Harleen and Rajveer get into an argument. Harleen states that she wants to go home and that she had made a huge mistake by trusting him. Rajveer angrily decides to let Harleen go and hands over the car keys to her. He tells her that he has no other motive than protecting her. She feels guilty and decides to stick to him. They begin to drive again in silence. Rajveer checks a location on his phone which Harleen notices. He then tells her that he has not killed an innocent person before this and does not want her to die. He tries to convince her to come with him for dinner.\n\nThey go to [[Pizza Hut]] where Rajveer realises that he has no money to buy food. They get into an argument about it. He teases Harleen about her internet dating and she slaps him. He threatens to shoot the server and she eventually pays for the pizza. Harleen asks him about the crime that he has committed and Rajveer shows her the Koh-i-Noor much to her surprise. She has a hard time believing that he is indeed a thief. As she comes to know about Rajveer, they realise that they were followed by Zorawar who says he has the restaurant surrounded with his men and will not be afraid to shoot Rajveer if needed to. As the officials convince Harleen to go with them, Rajveer tells Harleen that he cannot let her go with them. He shoots her with a tranquilizer dart and they both jump out of a window and escape.\n\nHarleen slips in and out of consciousness as Rajveer continues to take her to safety. She wakes up in a beach shack wearing a bikini top and shorts. She angrily asks Rajveer as to who changed her clothes and he confesses that he did it. She is angry beyond words. She beats him and bites his hand. Harleen then takes Rajveer's phone to call her grandmother, unbeknownst to her it allows the government officials to track their position. After a shootout occurs between Rajveer and the government officials, he escapes with Harleen with a help of a sea bob and a fly board.\n\nHarleen wakes up the next morning in [[Prague]]. As Rajveer was able to successfully lead the escape of them both, Harleen now entrusts Rajveer, subsequently falling in love with him. When Rajveer goes out of his hotel with Harleen, he sees that they are wanted by [[Interpol]]. Some policemen come at the moment and, in the process of concealing their faces, Rajveer and Harleen end up sharing a passionate kiss. Rajveer tracks Hamid Gul at a casino. Although he was to go alone, Harleen insists to take her along, to which he agrees. Staging a ploy for Gul's attention, Harleen and Gul meet in the hallway, where he tells her that a romantic candlelit champagne drink is waiting for her on the roof of the casino. Following this, Rajveer visits Gul at the top of the casino, and a fight ensues regarding the whereabouts of Zafar and he ultimately kills Gul. In the meantime, Harleen spots Zorawar and is taken to the Indian Embassy in Prague, where Zorawar says that Rajveer actually came to Prague to find Gul, and gives her a tracking device. Harleen is asked to get the Koh-i-Noor back. That night, Rajveer picks up Harleen at the entrance of a hotel where they had been saying, and they begin walking through a bridge, where Harleen says that the trust between them is broken, and that she knows about Gul's murder. Rajveer activates the tracking device himself, allowing the officials to surround them. Rajveer gives the Koh-i-Noor to Harleen and jumps from the bridge, but is shot, and is assumed dead.\n\nHarleen then returns home and remembers the address location that Rajveer was viewing on his phone. At the address, she meets Rajveer's father '''Pankaj''' ([[Kanwaljit Singh (actor)|Kanwaljit Singh]]) and his mother '''Shikha''' ([[Deepti Naval]]). At the house, Harleen sees photos of Rajveer and Viren, who are later revealed to be brothers and Shikha reveals their back stories. Although it is confirmed that Viren was murdered, Pankaj says that he does not believe in the story the army told him, saying that '''Jaiwant \"Jai\" Nanda''', Viren's brother, who is disguised as '''Rajveer''', had drowned despite being a swimming champion in his youth, as he was the only student who was able to cross the lake in only one breath. On her way home, Harleen is kidnapped by someone and next lands up in a fortress, where she meets Zafar, who learns and reveals that the diamond was a fake. Zorawar is then revealed to be Zafar's right-hand man, and gives Harleen a truth serum drug to reveal the location of the real diamond. Harleen deduces that Rajveer would have survived and is coming to kill Zafar. Jaiwant, in the meantime, is revealed to have actually survived, and silently kills every guard posted outside and places time bombs in every corner and enters the room. Zafar then orders his men to beat Rajveer but before Zafar is able to kill him Rajveer informs that the Koh-i-Noor was not stolen at all and it was a joint operation between the [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] and the [[Research and Analysis Wing|Indian Secret Service]] to get Zafar. The time bombs go off and destroy the castle, but Zafar manages to escape and captures Harleen again after making Rajveer crash. As they escape with her, Jaiwant follows them with a [[Formula One car|F1 car]] and catches up to them. Zafar enters a flight with Harleen. Killing the rest of Zafar's men including Zorawar, Jaiwant shoots at the flight blades evidently grounding the plane. He soon boards the plane and a final bout takes place between him and Zafar. After throwing him to the flames, Jaiwant frees Harleen. When they are escaping from the aircraft, Zafar emerges from the flames again and shoots Rajveer. Jaiwant pushes Harleen out of the aircraft and a second bullet hits him. He then grabs the axe and charges towards Zafar and kills him. When the aircraft is about to explode, he jumps out.\n\nHe loses consciousness and is about to drown when Harleen grabs his hand. The authorities air lift an injured and unconscious Jaiwant and Harleen.\n\nJaiwant then wakes up in hospital, where his commandant Narayanan ([[Vikram Gokhale]]) is sitting across him waiting for him to wake up. He congratulates Rajveer for successfully completing the mission. He rues about the fact that Viren was murdered and that Pankaj and Shikha will never get to see him again. Also, he informs Rajveer that Harleen has been sent back to her home and he has to forget about her because she can become a threat to his life and also his weakness. Rajveer is also told that he will be shifted to a safe facility the next day. After Narayanan leaves, a nurse arrives and gives Jaiwant a medicine to drink. As soon as he gulps down the medicine, he feels giddy and asks the nurse about it. The nurse turns around and removes her mask revealing that she is actually Harleen and the medicine was a sedative meant to knock Jaiwant out. A surprised Jaiwant tries to say her name but Harleen asks him to keep quiet. Jaiwant faints and Harleen escapes from the hospital along with him. He continues to slip in and out of consciousness until the next morning. He wakes up and Harleen tells him that his one-day has arrived. Jaiwant realises that she has brought him to his house. He silently thanks her, and they both reunite with Pankaj and Shikha.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Hrithik Roshan]] as Jaiwant \"Jai\" Nanda a.k.a.

As Viren informs Zafar that he will be extradited back to India for his crimes, Zafar's men enter his holding cell, led by Hamid Gul ([[Jaaved Jaffrey]]), killing all guards around them, with Zafar then killing Viren by shooting him and then burning him. As Zafar escapes in a helicopter waiting on the roof, he puts a $5&nbsp;million rewards for someone to steal the [[Koh-i-Noor]] diamond from the [[Tower of London]], but with one condition \u2013 the thief must be Indian, to hold up a new extradition treaty between India and UK. Soon after, a man named Rajveer Nanda ([[Hrithik Roshan]]) steals it, and when Zafar's men, led by Shoaib Hakhsar ([[Ankur Vikal]]) are informed of the theft, they travel to Rajveer for the deal. Although they initially travel with the $5&nbsp; million reward, Rajveer informs them that he now wants $20&nbsp; million for the deal. Following the disdain of the comment made by Rajveer, a fight breaks out between Rajveer and Zafar's men after which Rajveer flies away. After Rajveer escapes, a CCTV footage of him is captured, showing that he is in [[Shimla]]. Following an escape, he sees a young lady, Harleen Sahni ([[Katrina Kaif]]) sitting in a restaurant, who is there waiting for her internet date, \"Vickie Kapoor\", to show up. Rajveer enters the restaurant posing as \"Vickie\" and woos her over. He convinces Harleen to use the bathroom and while she is in there, Rajveer fights the remaining men who came searching for him and leaves the restaurant, much to the dismay of Harleen. As she drives home, Harleen accidentally runs over Rajveer, who asks her to stitch up a gunshot wound sustained during the fight. Rajveer then gives Harleen drugged water, with her complying with what he says about a few government officials, informing her about where to find guns underneath some car seat and what they will say about him.\n\nThe next day indeed, some government officials led by Zorawar Kalra ([[Pawan Malhotra]]) visit Harleen at her bank and threaten her to come with them. They tell her that if she does not accompany them, then they will reveal everything to her colleagues. Harleen decides to go with them to the police station. In the car, Zorawar tells her that they are not going to the station but they are taking her to a safe place instead. Harleen remembers about the gun that Rajveer had told her of. She engages the other official in small talk and finds the gun. She threatens both the officers to stop the car and let her go. At the same time, Rajveer appears on a bike and a chase sequence ensues. Both Rajveer and Harleen find a car and escape. When Rajveer goes out to shoot the goons, Harleen escapes and then bumps into her boss, Karan. She tells him about Rajveer and how random people are firing at her. Rajveer follows her. Karan tries to protect Harleen from Rajveer. He annoys Rajveer and gets shot by him in the leg. Harleen is exasperated but leaves with Rajveer again lest he shoots any more people.\n\nIn the car, Harleen and Rajveer get into an argument. Harleen states that she wants to go home and that she had made a huge mistake by trusting him. Rajveer angrily decides to let Harleen go and hands over the car keys to her. He tells her that he has no other motive than protecting her. She feels guilty and decides to stick to him. They begin to drive again in silence. Rajveer checks a location on his phone which Harleen notices. He then tells her that he has not killed an innocent person before this and does not want her to die. He tries to convince her to come with him for dinner.\n\nThey go to a restaurant where Rajveer realises that he has no money to buy food. They get into an argument about it. He teases Harleen about her internet dating and she slaps him. He threatens to shoot the server and she eventually pays for the pizza. Harleen asks him about the crime that he has committed and Rajveer shows her the Koh-i-Noor much to her surprise. She has a hard time believing that he is indeed a thief. As she comes to know about Rajveer, they realise that they were followed by Zorawar who says he has the restaurant surrounded with his men and will not be afraid to shoot Rajveer if needed to. As the officials convince Harleen to go with them, Rajveer tells Harleen that he cannot let her go with them. He shoots her with a tranquilizer dart and they both jump out of a window and escape.\n\nHarleen slips in and out of consciousness as Rajveer continues to take her to safety. She wakes up in a beach shack wearing a bikini top and shorts. She angrily asks Rajveer as to who changed her clothes and he confesses that he did it. She is angry beyond words. She beats him and bites his hand. Harleen then takes Rajveer's phone to call her grandmother, unbeknownst to her it allows the government officials to track their position. After a shootout occurs between Rajveer and the government officials, he escapes with Harleen with a help of a sea bob and a fly board.\n\nHarleen wakes up the next morning in [[Prague]]. As Rajveer was able to successfully lead the escape of them both, Harleen now entrusts Rajveer, subsequently falling in love with him. When Rajveer goes out of his hotel with Harleen, he sees that they are wanted by [[Interpol]]. Some policemen come at the moment and, in the process of concealing their faces, Rajveer and Harleen end up sharing a passionate kiss. Rajveer tracks Hamid Gul at a casino. Although he was to go alone, Harleen insists to take her along, to which he agrees. Staging a ploy for Gul's attention, Harleen and Gul meet in the hallway, where he tells her that a romantic candlelit champagne drink is waiting for her on the roof of the casino. Following this, Rajveer visits Gul at the top of the casino, and a fight ensues regarding the whereabouts of Zafar and he ultimately kills Gul. In the meantime, Harleen spots Zorawar and is taken to the Indian Embassy in Prague, where Zorawar says that Rajveer actually came to Prague to find Gul, and gives her a tracking device. Harleen is asked to get the Koh-i-Noor back. That night, Rajveer picks up Harleen at the entrance of a hotel where they had been staying, and they begin walking through a bridge, where Harleen says that the trust between them is broken, and that she knows about Gul's murder. Rajveer activates the tracking device himself, allowing the officials to surround them. Rajveer gives the Koh-i-Noor to Harleen and jumps from the bridge, but is shot, and is assumed dead.\n\nHarleen then returns home and remembers the address location that Rajveer was viewing on his phone. At the address, she meets Rajveer's father Pankaj ([[Kanwaljit Singh (actor)|Kanwaljit Singh]]) and his mother Shikha ([[Deepti Naval]]). At the house, Harleen sees photos of Rajveer and Viren, who are later revealed to be brothers and Shikha reveals their back stories. Although it is confirmed that Viren was murdered, Pankaj says that he does not believe in the story the army told him, saying that Jaiwant \"Jai\" Nanda, Viren's brother, who is disguised as Rajveer, had drowned despite being a swimming champion in his youth, as he was the only student who was able to cross the lake in only one breath. On her way home, Harleen is kidnapped by someone and next lands up in a fortress, where she meets Zafar, who learns and reveals that the diamond was a fake. Zorawar is then revealed to be Zafar's right-hand man, and gives Harleen a truth serum drug to reveal the location of the real diamond. Harleen deduces that Rajveer would have survived and is coming to kill Zafar. Jaiwant, in the meantime, is revealed to have actually survived, and silently kills every guard posted outside and places time bombs in every corner and enters the room. Zafar then orders his men to beat Rajveer but before Zafar is able to kill him Rajveer informs that the Koh-i-Noor was not stolen at all and it was a joint operation between the [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] and the [[Research and Analysis Wing|Indian Secret Service]] to get Zafar. The time bombs go off and destroy the castle, but Zafar manages to escape and captures Harleen again after making Rajveer crash. As they escape with her, Jaiwant follows them with a [[Formula One car|F1 car]] and catches up to them. Zafar enters a flight with Harleen. Killing the rest of Zafar's men including Zorawar, Jaiwant shoots at the flight blades evidently grounding the plane. He soon boards the plane and a final bout takes place between him and Zafar. After throwing him to the flames, Jaiwant frees Harleen. When they are escaping from the aircraft, Zafar emerges from the flames again and shoots Rajveer. Jaiwant pushes Harleen out of the aircraft and a second bullet hits him. He then grabs the axe and charges towards Zafar and kills him. When the aircraft is about to explode, he jumps out.\n\nHe loses consciousness and is about to drown when Harleen grabs his hand. The authorities air lift an injured and unconscious Jaiwant and Harleen.\n\nJaiwant then wakes up in hospital, where his commandant Narayanan ([[Vikram Gokhale]]) is sitting across him waiting for him to wake up. He congratulates Rajveer for successfully completing the mission. He rues about the fact that Viren was murdered and that Pankaj and Shikha will never get to see him again. Also, he informs Rajveer that Harleen has been sent back to her home and he has to forget about her because she can become a threat to his life and also his weakness. Rajveer is also told that he will be shifted to a safe facility the next day. After Narayanan leaves, a nurse arrives and gives Jaiwant a medicine to drink. As soon as he gulps down the medicine, he feels giddy and asks the nurse about it. The nurse turns around and removes her mask revealing that she is actually Harleen and the medicine was a sedative meant to knock Jaiwant out. A surprised Jaiwant tries to say her name but Harleen asks him to keep quiet. Jaiwant faints and Harleen escapes from the hospital along with him. He continues to slip in and out of consciousness until the next morning. He wakes up and Harleen tells him that his one-day has arrived. Jaiwant realises that she has brought him to his house. He silently thanks her, and they both reunite with Pankaj and Shikha.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Hrithik Roshan]] as '''Jaiwant \"Jai\" Nanda''' a.k.a.
