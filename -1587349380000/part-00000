''Missouri'' was the last battleship commissioned by the United States and is best remembered as the site of the [[Surrender of Japan|surrender of the Empire of Japan]], which ended [[World War II]].\n\n''Missouri'' was ordered in 1940 and commissioned in June 1944. In the [[Pacific War|Pacific Theater]] of World War II she fought in the battles of [[Battle of Iwo Jima|Iwo Jima]] and [[Battle of Okinawa|Okinawa]] and shelled the Japanese home islands, and she fought in the [[Korean War]] from 1950 to 1953. She was decommissioned in 1955 into the [[United States Navy reserve fleets]] (the \"Mothball Fleet\"), but reactivated and modernized in 1984 as part of the [[600-ship Navy]] plan, and provided fire support during [[Operation Desert Storm]] in January/February 1991.\n\n''Missouri'' received a total of 11 [[battle star]]s for service in World War II, Korea, and the Persian Gulf, and was finally decommissioned on 31 March 1992 after serving a total of 17 years of active service, but remained on the [[Naval Vessel Register]] until her name was struck in January 1995.

She departed Hawaii on 2 January 1945 and arrived in [[Ulithi]], West [[Caroline Islands]] on 13 January. There she was temporary headquarters ship for [[Vice Admiral]] [[Marc A. Mitscher]]. The battleship put to sea on 27 January to serve in the screen of the {{USS|Lexington|CV-16|2}} carrier task group of Mitscher's [[Fast Carrier Task Force|TF 58]], and on 16 February the task force's [[aircraft carrier]]s launched the first naval air strikes against Japan since the famed [[Doolittle raid]], which had been launched from the carrier {{USS|Hornet|CV-8|2}} in April 1942.<ref name=\"DANFS\" />\n\n''Missouri'' then steamed with the carriers to [[Iwo Jima]] where her main guns provided direct and continuous support to the [[Battle of Iwo Jima|invasion landings]] begun on 19 February. After TF 58 returned to Ulithi on 5 March, ''Missouri'' was assigned to the {{USS|Yorktown|CV-10|2}} carrier task group. On 14 March, ''Missouri'' departed Ulithi in the screen of the fast carriers and steamed to the Japanese mainland. During strikes against targets along the coast of the [[Seto Inland Sea|Inland Sea]] of Japan beginning on 18 March, ''Missouri'' shot down four Japanese aircraft.<ref name=\"DANFS\" />\n\nRaids against [[airfield]]s and [[naval base]]s near the Inland Sea and southwestern [[Honsh\u016b]] continued. When the carrier {{USS|Franklin|CV-13|2}} incurred battle damage, the ''Missouri''{{'}}s carrier task group provided cover for the ''Franklin's'' retirement toward Ulithi until 22 March, then set course for pre-invasion strikes and [[bombardment]] of [[Okinawa]].<ref name=\"DANFS\" />\n\n''Missouri'' joined the fast battleships of TF 58 in bombarding the southeast coast of Okinawa on 24 March, an action intended to draw enemy strength from the west coast beaches that would be the actual site of invasion landings.

Some topside fittings were smashed, but ''Missouri'' suffered no major damage. Her fleet again struck Ky\u016bsh\u016b on 8 June, then hit hard in a coordinated air-surface bombardment before retiring towards [[Leyte (island)|Leyte]]. She arrived at [[San Pedro Bay (Philippines)|San Pedro Bay]], Leyte on 13 June, after almost three months of continuous operations in support of the [[Battle of Okinawa|Okinawa campaign]].<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\nHere she rejoined the powerful 3rd Fleet in strikes at the heart of Japan from within its home waters. The fleet set a northerly course on 8 July to approach the Japanese main island, Honsh\u016b. Raids took Tokyo by surprise on 10 July, followed by more devastation at the juncture of [[Honsh\u016b]] and [[Hokkaid\u014d]], the second-largest Japanese island, on 13\u201314 July. For the first time, naval gunfire destroyed a major installation within the home islands when ''Missouri'' [[Allied naval bombardments of Japan during World War II|joined in a shore bombardment]] on 15 July that severely damaged the Nihon Steel Co. and the Wanishi Ironworks at [[Muroran, Hokkaido]].<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\nDuring the nights of 17 and 18 July, ''Missouri'' bombarded industrial targets in Honsh\u016b.

the [[United States Navy]] to be named after the [[U.S. state]] of [[Missouri]]. ''Missouri'' was the last battleship commissioned by the United States and is best remembered as the site of the [[Surrender of Japan|surrender of the Empire of Japan]], which ended [[World War II]].\n\n''Missouri'' was ordered in 1940 and commissioned in June 1944. In the [[Pacific War|Pacific Theater]] of World War II she fought in the battles of [[Battle of Iwo Jima|Iwo Jima]] and [[Battle of Okinawa|Okinawa]] and shelled the Japanese home islands, and she fought in the [[Korean War]] from 1950 to 1953. She was decommissioned in 1955 into the [[United States Navy reserve fleets]] (the \"Mothball Fleet\"), but reactivated and modernized in 1984 as part of the [[600-ship Navy]] plan, and provided fire support during [[Operation Desert Storm]] in January/February 1991.\n\n''Missouri'' received a total of 11 [[battle star]]s for service in World War II, Korea, and the Persian Gulf, and was finally decommissioned on 31 March 1992 after serving a total of 17 years of active service, but remained on the [[Naval Vessel Register]] until her name was struck in January 1995. In 1998, she was donated to the USS ''Missouri'' Memorial Association and became a [[museum ship]] at [[Pearl Harbor]].\n\n== Construction ==\n{{Main|Iowa-class battleship|Armament of the Iowa-class battleship}}\n\n''Missouri'' was one of the {{sclass-|Iowa|battleship|0}} \"[[fast battleship]]\" designs planned in 1938 by the Preliminary Design Branch at the [[Bureau of Construction and Repair]].

She departed Hawaii on 2 January 1945 and arrived in [[Ulithi]], West [[Caroline Islands]] on 13 January. There she was temporary headquarters ship for [[Vice Admiral]] [[Marc A. Mitscher]]. The battleship put to sea on 27 January to serve in the screen of the {{USS|Lexington|CV-16|2}} carrier task group of Mitscher's [[Fast Carrier Task Force|TF 58]], and on 16 February the task force's [[aircraft carrier]]s launched the first naval air strikes against Japan since the famed [[Doolittle raid]], which had been launched from the carrier {{USS|Hornet|CV-8|2}} in April 1942.<ref name=\"DANFS\" />\n\n''Missouri'' then steamed with the carriers to [[Iwo Jima]] where her main guns provided direct and continuous support to the [[Battle of Iwo Jima|invasion landings]] begun on 19 February. After TF 58 returned to Ulithi on 5 March, ''Missouri'' was assigned to the {{USS|Yorktown|CV-10|2}} carrier task group. On 14 March, ''Missouri'' departed Ulithi in the screen of the fast carriers and steamed to the Japanese mainland. During strikes against targets along the coast of the [[Seto Inland Sea|Inland Sea]] of Japan beginning on 18 March, ''Missouri'' shot down four Japanese aircraft.<ref name=\"DANFS\" />\n\nRaids against [[airfield]]s and [[naval base]]s near the Inland Sea and southwestern [[Honsh\u016b]] continued. When the carrier {{USS|Franklin|CV-13|2}} incurred battle damage, the ''Missouri''{{'}}s carrier task group provided cover for the ''Franklin's'' retirement toward Ulithi until 22 March, then set course for pre-invasion strikes and [[bombardment]] of [[Okinawa]].<ref name=\"DANFS\" />\n\n''Missouri'' joined the fast battleships of TF 58 in bombarding the southeast coast of Okinawa on 24 March, an action intended to draw enemy strength from the west coast beaches that would be the actual site of invasion landings.

She arrived at [[San Pedro Bay (Philippines)|San Pedro Bay]], Leyte on 13 June, after almost three months of continuous operations in support of the [[Battle of Okinawa|Okinawa campaign]].<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\nHere she rejoined the powerful 3rd Fleet in strikes at the heart of Japan from within its home waters. The fleet set a northerly course on 8 July to approach the Japanese main island, Honsh\u016b. Raids took Tokyo by surprise on 10 July, followed by more devastation at the juncture of [[Honsh\u016b]] and [[Hokkaid\u014d]], the second-largest Japanese island, on 13\u201314 July. For the first time, naval gunfire destroyed a major installation within the home islands when ''Missouri'' [[Allied naval bombardments of Japan during World War II|joined in a shore bombardment]] on 15 July that severely damaged the Nihon Steel Co. and the Wanishi Ironworks at [[Muroran, Hokkaido]].<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\nDuring the nights of 17 and 18 July, ''Missouri'' bombarded industrial targets in Honsh\u016b.

He then ran back to his retreating regiment carrying both flags safely from the battlefield. It was for this action he was awarded the Medal of Honor. More than half of Allen\u2019s regiment were killed or wounded in the battle.\n\n==Later years==\n[[File:Nathaniel Allen grave marker.jpg|thumb|Grave marker in the Acton [[Woodlawn Cemetery (Acton, Massachusetts)|Woodlawn Cemetery]]]]\nAfter the Civil War ended, Nathaniel returned to Boston where he continued his old trade as a watchmaker.
