In 1935, the National Loan and Investment Board (NLIB) was created to coordinate and manage various government trust funds such as the Postal Savings Fund and the Teacher's Retirement Fund. \n\nIn 1939, the NLIB was abolished and its functions were transferred to a new body, the Agricultural and Industrial Bank (AIB). AIB continued operations until the outbreak of [[World War II]]. \n\nIn 1947, the government created the Rehabilitation Finance Corporation (RFC) under R.A. No. 85 which absorbed the assets and took over the functions of the AIB. The RFC provided [[Credit (finance)|credit]] facilities for the development of agriculture, [[commerce]] and [[industry]] and the reconstruction of properties damaged by the war. \n\nIn 1958, the RFC was reorganized into the modern-day DBP.\u00a0 The change in corporate name marked the shift from rehabilitation to broader activities.\n\nWith an initial [[Financial capital|capital]] of P500-million, DBP set to work on expanding its facilities and operations to accelerate efforts towards promoting national economic development. The bank established a nationwide branch network and tapped local and foreign resources to complement its capital. It also borrowed money directly from international finance institutions.\n\nIn the late 1970s up to the early 1980s, however, its viability was undermined by numerous non-performing accounts. \n\nIn 1986, former Philippine President Corazon Aquino issued Executive Order No. 81<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/1986/12/03/executive-order-no-81-s-1986/|title=Executive Order No. 81, s. 1986 {{!}} GOVPH|website=Official Gazette of the Republic of the Philippines|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-16}}</ref>, which reorganized the bank and gave it a new charter. All non-performing assets and liabilities were subsequently transferred to the government. DBP undertook an institutional strengthening program, including a thorough revision of its credit process, as well as employee training programs towards the intensive implementation of its new lending thrusts. DBP likewise reopened its lending windows for housing, agriculture and SMEs.\n\nIn 1995, DBP was granted an expanded banking license and attained universal banking status.\n\nFormer Philippine President Fidel Ramos signed Republic Act 8523 in 1998, amending DBP\u2019s 1986 charter. Among the major provisions incorporated in the new DBP charter were the increase of authorized capital stock from P5-billion to P35-billion, and the creation of the position of President and CEO.\n\nIn February 2016, former Philippine President [[Benigno Aquino III]] approved the merger of DBP with state-owned [[Land Bank of the Philippines|Land Bank]] of the Philippines, with pending approval from the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas and written consent of the Philippine Deposit Insurance Corporation.\u00a0 However, as of September 2016, the proposed DBP-Landbank merger has been canceled for implementation by the Governance Commission for GOCCs (GCG).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/813359/duterte-administration-stops-dbp-landmark-merger|title=Duterte administration stops DBP-Land Bank merger|last=Vera|first=Ben O. de|website=newsinfo.inquirer.net|language=en|access-date=2019-04-16}}</ref>\n\n==Organization==\nThe affairs and business of DBP are directed and its properties managed and preserved and its corporate powers exercised by a board of directors consisting of nine members, all appointed by the President of the Philippines.

In [[northern Kentucky]] plus Louisville and Lexington, [[Cincinnati chili]] is a popular [[fast food]]. [[Northern Kentucky]] and the [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]] area are also home to a pronounced [[German-American]] population, translating into northern-like preferences for beer and European [[sausages]]. However, the remainder of the state's cuisine tends to be thoroughly Southern, preferring breakfast meats like [[country ham]], ground pork sausage and as their beverage of choice, the state's renowned [[bourbon whiskey]]. Some common desserts are [[chess pie]], [[pecan pie]], [[blackberry]] [[cobbler (food)|cobbler]] and [[bread pudding]].\n\n==History==\nPioneer and missionary author [[Timothy Flint]] wrote that the Kentuckians ate [[persimon]], venison, wild turkey, [[sweet potato]] and \"pies smoked on the table\" washed down with [[maple beer]] and [[Madeira wine]] when game with plentiful, and \"hog and homily\" in lean times.\nFood prices were low and money hard to come by in the intervening years between settlement and admission to the [[United States|Union]]. Salt was quite costly, but sweeteners like honey and maple were more commonly available. Prices for staple foodstuffs such as beef, mutton, pork, geese, chicken, turkey, butter and flour are known from [[Gilbert Imlay]]'s account.<ref name=\"moore\">{{cite book |last1=Moore |first1=Arthur K. |title=The Frontier Mind: A Cultural Analysis of the Kentucky Frontiersman |date=1957 |publisher=University of Kentucky Press |page=58-60}}</ref> \n\nHomes in the frontier lands of Kentucky were often unfloored, the shelters ranged between humble [[lean-to]]s and more sturdy cabins. Only in the better cabins were [[hearth]]s made with stone. [[Daniel Drake]], a Cincinnati born physician, described his 18th century Kentucky home:<ref name=\"moore\"/>\n<blockquote>\"I know of no scene in civilized life more primitive than such a cabin hearth as that of my mother.

In [[northern Kentucky]] plus Louisville and Lexington, [[Cincinnati chili]] is a popular [[fast food]]. [[Northern Kentucky]] and the [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]] area are also home to a pronounced [[German-American]] population, translating into northern-like preferences for beer and European [[sausages]]. However, the remainder of the state's cuisine tends to be thoroughly Southern, preferring breakfast meats like [[country ham]], ground pork sausage and as their beverage of choice, the state's renowned [[bourbon whiskey]]. Some common desserts are [[chess pie]], [[pecan pie]], [[blackberry]] [[cobbler (food)|cobbler]] and [[bread pudding]].\n\n==History==\nPioneer and missionary author [[Timothy Flint]] wrote that the Kentuckians ate [[persimon]], venison, wild turkey, [[sweet potato]] and \"pies smoked on the table\" washed down with [[maple beer]] and [[Madeira wine]] when game with plentiful, and \"hog and homily\" in lean times.\nFood prices were low and money hard to come by in the intervening years between settlement and admission to the [[United States|Union]]. Salt was quite costly, but sweeteners like honey and maple were more commonly available. Prices for staple foodstuffs such as beef, mutton, pork, geese, chicken, turkey, butter and flour are known from [[Gilbert Imlay]]'s account.<ref name=\"moore\">{{cite book |last1=Moore |first1=Arthur K. |title=The Frontier Mind: A Cultural Analysis of the Kentucky Frontiersman |date=1957 |publisher=University of Kentucky Press |page=58-60}}</ref> \n\nHomes in the frontier lands of Kentucky, often unfloored, ranged between humble [[lean-to]]s and more sturdy cabins.

Sometimes referring to God and sometimes the mighty when used to refer to the God of Israel, El is almost always qualified by additional words that further define the meaning that distinguishes him from [[false god]]s. A common title of God in the Hebrew Bible is Elohim (Hebrew: \u05d0\u05dc\u05d4\u05d9\u05dd). The root ''[[Eloah]]'' (\u05d0\u05dc\u05d4) is used in poetry and late prose (e.g., the [[Book of Job]]) and ending with the masculine plural suffix \"-im\" \u05d9\u05dd creating a word like ''[[baal|ba`alim]]'' (\"owner(s)\" and ''[[adon]]im'' (\"lord(s), master(s)\") that may also indicate a singular identity.\n\nIn the [[Book of Exodus]], God commands Moses to tell the people that 'I AM' sent him, and this is revered as one of the most important names of God according to [[Pentateuch|Mosaic]] tradition.\n\n{{quote|Moses said to God, \u201cSuppose I go to the Israelites and say to them, \u2018The God of your fathers has sent me to you,\u2019 and they ask me, \u2018What is his name?\u2019 Then what shall I tell them?\u201d God said to Moses, \u201c''I am who I am.''

The resulting substitute made from [[Mater lectionis|semivowels and glottals]], known as the tetragrammaton, is not ordinarily permitted to be pronounced aloud, even in prayer. The prohibition on misuse (not use) of this name is the primary subject of the command not to [[Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain|take the name of the Lord in vain]].\n\nInstead of pronouncing YHWH during [[prayer]], Jews say \"[[Adonai]]\" (\"Lord\"). ''[[Halakha]]'' requires that secondary rules be placed around the primary law, to reduce the chance that the main law will be broken. As such, it is common religious practice to restrict the use of the word \"Adonai\" to prayer only. In conversation, many Jewish people, even when not speaking Hebrew, will call God ''[[Names of God in Judaism#HaShem|HaShem]]'' (\u05d4\u05e9\u05dd), which is Hebrew for \"the Name\" (this appears in {{Bibleref2|Leviticus|24:11}}).\n\nAlmost all [[Orthodox Jews]] avoid using either Yahweh or Jehovah altogether on the basis that the actual pronunciation of the tetragrammaton has been lost in antiquity. Many use the term ''HaShem'' as an indirect reference, or they use \"God\" or \"The Lord\" instead.\n\n=== Christianity ===\n{{Main|Names of God in Christianity}}\n{{Further|Jehovah}}\n{{See also|Names and titles of Jesus in the New Testament}}\nSome [[biblical scholar]]s say YHWH was most likely pronounced ''Yahweh''.<ref name=WGPlaut-YHWH /> References, such as ''The New [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'', validate the above by offering additional specifics to its (Christian) reconstruction out of Greek sources:\n<blockquote>Early Christian writers, such as Clement of Alexandria in the 2nd century, had used a form like Yahweh, and claim that this pronunciation of the tetragrammaton was never really lost.

A Christian writer of the sixteenth century who was unaware of this substitution transcribed the word as he saw it, namely as [[Jehovah]], and this error has since entered many Christian Bibles [5]. 5. Only rarely has the pronunciation Jehovah been given scholarly endorsement; one exception is J. Neubauer, ''Bibelwissenschaftliche Irrungen'' (Berlin: Louis Lamm, 1917), who bases his opinion on [[Jerusalem Talmud]] San.. 10:1, describing the controversy between the Rabbanites and the Samaritans over the proniunciation.

God has many names in Islam, the Qur'an says (translation) to Him Belong the Best Names (Lahu Al-Asma' Al-Husna), examples like [[Ar-Rahman]] (The Entirely Merciful), Ar-Rahim (The Especially Merciful).

In all vedic texts, God has been revered by the name Param Brahma, Brahmana (not to confuse with the caste), Parmatma (Supreme Soul), Parampita (Supreme Father), Parmaeshwara (The Ultimate Governor). Besides, There are multiple names for God's Various Forms worshiped as Demigod Deities (Devata and Devi)  in [[Hinduism]]. Some of the popular names for these Deities in Hinduism are:\n* [[Krishna]]/[[Vishnu|Maha Vishnu]]/[[Hari]], \u0915\u0943\u0937\u094d\u0923 Krishna is recognised as the complete and or as the Supreme God in his own right.

According to Jain doctrine, the universe and its constituents (soul, matter, space, time, and principles of motion) have [[Jainism and non-creationism|always existed]]. All the constituents and actions are governed by universal natural laws and an immaterial entity like God cannot create a material entity like the universe. Jainism offers an elaborate [[Jain cosmology|cosmology]], including heavenly beings (''devas''), but these beings are not viewed as creators; they are subject to suffering and change like all other living beings, and must eventually die.\n\nJains define godliness as the inherent quality of any soul characterizing infinite bliss, infinite power, [[Kevala Jnana|Perfect knowledge]] and Perfect peace. However, these qualities of a soul are subdued due to [[Karma in Jainism|karmas]] of the soul. One who achieves this state of soul through [[Ratnatraya|right belief, right knowledge and right conduct]] can be termed as god. This perfection of soul is called ''[[Kevala Jnana|Kaivalya]]'' (Omniscience). A liberated soul thus becomes a god \u2013 liberated of miseries, cycles of rebirth, world, ''karmas'' and finally liberated of body as well. This is called ''[[Nirvana (Jainism)|nirvana]]'' or ''[[Moksa (Jainism)|moksha]]''.\n\nIf godliness is defined as the state of having freed one's soul from karmas and the attainment of [[enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]]/Nirvana and a god as one who exists in such a state, then those who have achieved such a state can be termed gods/''[[Tirthankara]]''. Thus, [[Rishabha (Jain tirthankar)|Rishabhanatha]] was god/''Tirthankara'' but he was not the only ''Tirthankara''; there were many other ''Tirthankara''. However, the quality of godliness is one and the same in all of them.\n\nJainism does not teach the dependency on any supreme being for enlightenment. The Tirthankara is a guide and teacher who points the way to enlightenment, but the struggle for enlightenment is one's own. Moral rewards and sufferings are not the work of a divine being, but a result of an innate moral order in the [[cosmos]]; a self-regulating mechanism whereby the individual reaps the fruits of his own actions through the workings of the karmas.\n\nJains believe that to attain enlightenment and ultimately liberation from all karmic bonding, one must practice the ethical principles not only in thought, but also in words (speech) and action. Such a practice through lifelong work towards oneself is called as observing the ''[[Mahavrata]]'' (\"Great Vows\").\n\nGods can be thus categorized into embodied gods also known as ''[[Tirthankara|T\u012brthankaras]] and [[Arihant (Jainism)|Arihanta]]s'' or ordinary ''[[Kevala J\u00f1\u0101na|Kevalis]]'', and non-embodied formless gods who are called ''[[Siddha]]s''. Jainism considers the ''dev\u012bs'' and ''devas'' to be souls who dwell in heavens owing to meritorious deeds in their past lives. These souls are in heavens for a fixed lifespan and even they have to undergo reincarnation as humans to achieve ''moksha''.\n\n==Sikhism==\n{{Main|God in Sikhism}}\nThere are multiple names for God in Sikhism. Some of the popular names for God in Sikhism are:\n* [[Akal Purakh]], meaning ''timeless being''.\n* [[Ik Onkar]], ''One Creator'', found at the beginning of the Sikh [[Mul Mantar]].\n* [[Nirankar]], meaning ''formless''\n* [[Satnam]] meaning ''True Name'', some are of the opinion that this is a name for God in itself, others believe that this is an adjective used to describe the \"Gurmantar\", Waheguru.\n* [[Waheguru]], meaning ''Wonderful Teacher bringing light to remove darkness,'' this name is considered the greatest among Sikhs, and it is known as ''Gurmantar'', the Guru's Word. Waheguru is the only way to meet God in Sikhism.\n* ''D\u0101t\u0101'' or ''D\u0101t\u0101r'', meaning ''the Giver''\n* ''Kart\u0101'' or ''Kart\u0101r'', meaning ''the Doer''\n* ''Di\u0101l'', meaning ''compassionate'' \n* ''Kirp\u0101l'', meaning ''benevolent''\n\nIn the Sikh scripture, both Hindu and Muslim names of the Supreme Being are also commonly employed, expressing different aspects of the divine Name. For instance, names like [[Rama|Ram]] (pervading), [[Hari]] (shining), [[Parameshwara (God)|Parmeshwar]] (supreme lord), and Jagdish (world lord) refer to Hindu terms, while names like [[Allah]] (Arabic for God), [[Khuda]] (Persian for God), [[Rahim]] (merciful), [[Karim]] (generous), and [[Sahib]] (lord) are of Muslim origin.<ref>Pashaura Singh (2014), in The Oxford Handbook of Sikh Studies (Editors: Pashaura Singh, Louis E. Fenech), Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0199699308}}, page 228</ref>\n\nGod, according to [[Guru Nanak]], is beyond full comprehension by [[human]]s; has endless number of virtues; takes on innumerable forms, but is formless; and can be called by an infinite number of names thus \"Your Names are so many, and Your Forms are endless.

Sometimes referring to God and sometimes the mighty when used to refer to the God of Israel, El is almost always qualified by additional words that further define the meaning that distinguishes him from [[false god]]s. A common title of God in the Hebrew Bible is Elohim (Hebrew: \u05d0\u05dc\u05d4\u05d9\u05dd). The root ''[[Eloah]]'' (\u05d0\u05dc\u05d4) is used in poetry and late prose (e.g., the [[Book of Job]]) and ending with the masculine plural suffix \"-im\" \u05d9\u05dd creating a word like ''[[baal|ba`alim]]'' (\"owner(s)\" and ''[[adon]]im'' (\"lord(s), master(s)\") that may also indicate a singular identity.\n\nIn the [[Book of Exodus]], God commands Moses to tell the people that 'I AM' sent him, and this is revered as one of the most important names of God according to [[Pentateuch|Mosaic]] tradition.\n\n{{quote|Moses said to God, \u201cSuppose I go to the Israelites and say to them, \u2018The God of your fathers has sent me to you,\u2019 and they ask me, \u2018What is his name?\u2019 Then what shall I tell them?\u201d God said to Moses, \u201c''I am who I am.''

The resulting substitute made from [[Mater lectionis|semivowels and glottals]], known as the tetragrammaton, is not ordinarily permitted to be pronounced aloud, even in prayer. The prohibition on misuse (not use) of this name is the primary subject of the command not to [[Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain|take the name of the Lord in vain]].\n\nInstead of pronouncing YHWH during [[prayer]], Jews say \"[[Adonai]]\" (\"Lord\"). ''[[Halakha]]'' requires that secondary rules be placed around the primary law, to reduce the chance that the main law will be broken. As such, it is common religious practice to restrict the use of the word \"Adonai\" to prayer only. In conversation, many Jewish people, even when not speaking Hebrew, will call God ''[[Names of God in Judaism#HaShem|HaShem]]'' (\u05d4\u05e9\u05dd), which is Hebrew for \"the Name\" (this appears in {{Bibleref2|Leviticus|24:11}}).\n\nAlmost all [[Orthodox Jews]] avoid using either Yahweh or Jehovah altogether on the basis that the actual pronunciation of the tetragrammaton has been lost in antiquity. Many use the term ''HaShem'' as an indirect reference, or they use \"God\" or \"The Lord\" instead.\n\n=== Christianity ===\n{{Main|Names of God in Christianity}}\n{{Further|Jehovah}}\n{{See also|Names and titles of Jesus in the New Testament}}\nSome [[biblical scholar]]s say YHWH was most likely pronounced ''Yahweh''.<ref name=WGPlaut-YHWH /> References, such as ''The New [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'', validate the above by offering additional specifics to its (Christian) reconstruction out of Greek sources:\n<blockquote>Early Christian writers, such as Clement of Alexandria in the 2nd century, had used a form like Yahweh, and claim that this pronunciation of the tetragrammaton was never really lost.

A Christian writer of the sixteenth century who was unaware of this substitution transcribed the word as he saw it, namely as [[Jehovah]], and this error has since entered many Christian Bibles [5]. 5. Only rarely has the pronunciation Jehovah been given scholarly endorsement; one exception is J. Neubauer, ''Bibelwissenschaftliche Irrungen'' (Berlin: Louis Lamm, 1917), who bases his opinion on [[Jerusalem Talmud]] San.. 10:1, describing the controversy between the Rabbanites and the Samaritans over the proniunciation.

More specifically, it has been used as a term for God by [[Muslims]] (both Arab and non-Arab) and [[Arab Christians]]. God has many names in Islam, the Qur'an says (translation) to Him Belong the Best Names (Lahu Al-Asma' Al-Husna), examples like [[Ar-Rahman]] (The Entirely Merciful), Ar-Rahim (The Especially Merciful). Beside these Arabic names, Muslims of non-Arab origins may also sometimes use other names in their own languages to refer to God, such as [[#xoda<!-- explained above -->|Khuda]] in [[Farsi|Persian]], [[Bengali language|Bengali]] and [[Urdu]].

In all vedic texts, God has been revered by the name Param Brahma, Brahmana (not to confuse with the caste), Parmatma (Supreme Soul), Parampita (Supreme Father), Parmaeshwara (The Ultimate Governor). Besides, There are multiple names for God's Various Forms worshiped as Demigod Deities (Devata and Devi)  in [[Hinduism]]. Some of the popular names for these Deities in Hinduism are:\n* [[Krishna]]/[[Vishnu|Maha Vishnu]]/[[Hari]]/Ranganatha, \u0915\u0943\u0937\u094d\u0923 Krishna is recognised as the complete and or as the Supreme God in his own right. Krishna is one of the most widely revered and popular of all Hindu deities and proprietor of all other demigods.\n* [[Bhagavan]]/Prabhu, \u092d\u0917\u0935\u093e\u0928 the most frequently used name for God in [[Hinduism]].\n* [[Brahman]],\u092c\u094d\u0930\u0939\u094d\u092e\u0928\u094d the unchanging reality amidst and beyond the world, which cannot be exactly defined.\n* [[Isvara]] \u0908\u0936\u094d\u0935\u0930 is a theological concept in Hinduism translating to \"lord,\" applied to the \"Supreme Being\" or God in the monotheistic sense, or as an Ishta-deva in monistic thought.\n* [[Brahma]], \u092c\u094d\u0930\u0939\u094d\u092e\u093e is the Hindu god of creation and one of the [[Trimurti]].\n* [[Visnu|Maha Visnu]]/[[Visnu|Adi Narayan]] \u0935\u093f\u0937\u094d\u0923\u0941 is the Supreme God of [[Vaishnavism]], Maha Vishnu is the Para Brahman And one of the three main sects of Hinduism.\n* [[Shiva|Siva]] \u0936\u093f\u0935 is the Supreme God of [[Shaivism]], one of the three main sects of Hinduism\n* [[Shakti]] \u0936\u0915\u094d\u0924\u093f represents the dynamic forces that are thought to move through the entire [[universe]] in [[Hinduism]]. And is the supreme God(dess) in [[Shaktism]]<ref>Sacred Sanskrit words, p.111</ref> \n*\nAdditionally, most Hindu demigods have a collection of 108 names. Each collection of 108 names is known as that demigod's Astottara Satanamavali, which is chanted during pujas or prayer. Gods with 108 names include Krishna, [[Ganesha]], [[Vishnu]], [[Shiva]], [[Lakshmi]].\n\nThe Mahabharata, (Anusasana Parva) book 13, (S-149) lists the thousand names of the one god Vasudeva (Krishna).<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Mahabharata, Book 13: Anusasana Parva: Section CXLIX |url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m13/m13b114.htm |website=sacred-texts.com |accessdate = 2015-10-20}}</ref> That collection is known as the [[Vishnu Sahasranaamam]].\n\n===Arya Samaj===\n{{Main|Satyarth Prakash}}\n[[Maharishi Dayanand]] in his book ''Vaghasiya Ayush'' has listed 100 names of God each representing some property or attribute thereof mentioning \u201cOm or [[Aum]]\u201d as God's personal and natural name.

According to Jain doctrine, the universe and its constituents (soul, matter, space, time, and principles of motion) have [[Jainism and non-creationism|always existed]]. All the constituents and actions are governed by universal natural laws and an immaterial entity like God cannot create a material entity like the universe. Jainism offers an elaborate [[Jain cosmology|cosmology]], including heavenly beings (''devas''), but these beings are not viewed as creators; they are subject to suffering and change like all other living beings, and must eventually die.\n\nJains define godliness as the inherent quality of any soul characterizing infinite bliss, infinite power, [[Kevala Jnana|Perfect knowledge]] and Perfect peace. However, these qualities of a soul are subdued due to [[Karma in Jainism|karmas]] of the soul. One who achieves this state of soul through [[Ratnatraya|right belief, right knowledge and right conduct]] can be termed as god. This perfection of soul is called ''[[Kevala Jnana|Kaivalya]]'' (Omniscience). A liberated soul thus becomes a god \u2013 liberated of miseries, cycles of rebirth, world, ''karmas'' and finally liberated of body as well. This is called ''[[Nirvana (Jainism)|nirvana]]'' or ''[[Moksa (Jainism)|moksha]]''.\n\nIf godliness is defined as the state of having freed one's soul from karmas and the attainment of [[enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]]/Nirvana and a god as one who exists in such a state, then those who have achieved such a state can be termed gods/''[[Tirthankara]]''. Thus, [[Rishabha (Jain tirthankar)|Rishabhanatha]] was god/''Tirthankara'' but he was not the only ''Tirthankara''; there were many other ''Tirthankara''. However, the quality of godliness is one and the same in all of them.\n\nJainism does not teach the dependency on any supreme being for enlightenment. The Tirthankara is a guide and teacher who points the way to enlightenment, but the struggle for enlightenment is one's own. Moral rewards and sufferings are not the work of a divine being, but a result of an innate moral order in the [[cosmos]]; a self-regulating mechanism whereby the individual reaps the fruits of his own actions through the workings of the karmas.\n\nJains believe that to attain enlightenment and ultimately liberation from all karmic bonding, one must practice the ethical principles not only in thought, but also in words (speech) and action. Such a practice through lifelong work towards oneself is called as observing the ''[[Mahavrata]]'' (\"Great Vows\").\n\nGods can be thus categorized into embodied gods also known as ''[[Tirthankara|T\u012brthankaras]] and [[Arihant (Jainism)|Arihanta]]s'' or ordinary ''[[Kevala J\u00f1\u0101na|Kevalis]]'', and non-embodied formless gods who are called ''[[Siddha]]s''. Jainism considers the ''dev\u012bs'' and ''devas'' to be souls who dwell in heavens owing to meritorious deeds in their past lives. These souls are in heavens for a fixed lifespan and even they have to undergo reincarnation as humans to achieve ''moksha''.\n\n==Sikhism==\n{{Main|God in Sikhism}}\nThere are multiple names for God in Sikhism. Some of the popular names for God in Sikhism are:\n* [[Akal Purakh]], meaning ''timeless being''.\n* [[Ik Onkar]], ''One Creator'', found at the beginning of the Sikh [[Mul Mantar]].\n* [[Nirankar]], meaning ''formless''\n* [[Satnam]] meaning ''True Name'', some are of the opinion that this is a name for God in itself, others believe that this is an adjective used to describe the \"Gurmantar\", Waheguru.\n* [[Waheguru]], meaning ''Wonderful Teacher bringing light to remove darkness,'' this name is considered the greatest among Sikhs, and it is known as ''Gurmantar'', the Guru's Word. Waheguru is the only way to meet God in Sikhism.\n* ''D\u0101t\u0101'' or ''D\u0101t\u0101r'', meaning ''the Giver''\n* ''Kart\u0101'' or ''Kart\u0101r'', meaning ''the Doer''\n* ''Di\u0101l'', meaning ''compassionate'' \n* ''Kirp\u0101l'', meaning ''benevolent''\n\nIn the Sikh scripture, both Hindu and Muslim names of the Supreme Being are also commonly employed, expressing different aspects of the divine Name. For instance, names like [[Rama|Ram]] (pervading), [[Hari]] (shining), [[Parameshwara (God)|Parmeshwar]] (supreme lord), and Jagdish (world lord) refer to Hindu terms, while names like [[Allah]] (Arabic for God), [[Khuda]] (Persian for God), [[Rahim]] (merciful), [[Karim]] (generous), and [[Sahib]] (lord) are of Muslim origin.<ref>Pashaura Singh (2014), in The Oxford Handbook of Sikh Studies (Editors: Pashaura Singh, Louis E. Fenech), Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0199699308}}, page 228</ref>\n\nGod, according to [[Guru Nanak]], is beyond full comprehension by [[human]]s; has endless number of virtues; takes on innumerable forms, but is formless; and can be called by an infinite number of names thus \"Your Names are so many, and Your Forms are endless. No one can tell how many Glorious Virtues You have.\"<ref>''Guru Granth Sahib'' p. 358</ref>\n\nThe word [[Allah]] (\u0a05\u0a32\u0a39\u0a41) is used 12 times in the Guru Granth Sahib by Sheikh Farid. Guru Nanak Dev, Guru Arjan Dev and Bhagat Kabeer used the word 18 times.\n\n==Zoroastrianism==\n{{Main|101 Names of God}}\nIn [[Zoroastrianism]],  101 names of God ([[Pazand]] ''Sad-o-yak nam-i-khoda'') is a list of names of God ([[Ahura Mazda]]).
