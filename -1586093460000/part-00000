The team also reached the quarter-final stage of the [[1964 European Nations' Cup]], where they lost to the eventual champions [[Spain national football team|Spain]].\n\nUnder the guidance of [[Jack Charlton]], the team enjoyed its most successful era, reaching their highest [[FIFA World Rankings|FIFA world ranking]] ever at sixth in August 1993, and qualifying for [[UEFA Euro 1988]] in their first appearance at the [[UEFA European Championship]], reaching the quarter-finals of the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]] in their first ever appearance at the finals, as well as making the last 16 at the [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994 edition]]. Charlton's successor [[Mick McCarthy]] lost out on the next two major tournaments but ultimately qualified for the [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002 World Cup]], making it to the last 16. Under [[Giovanni Trapattoni]], the team narrowly lost out on qualification for the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010]] World Cup during a [[2009 Republic of Ireland v France football matches|controversial play-off]], but went on to qualify for [[UEFA Euro 2012|Euro 2012]].\n\nThe team failed to qualify for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014 World Cup]] in Brazil, marking the end of Trapattoni's tenure as manager. The Republic of Ireland also fell to a record low FIFA ranking of 59th, then a record low of 70th in June 2014.<ref>[https://www.fifa.com/worldranking/rankingtable/index.html FIFA Rankings] FIFA.

In 1920, Ireland [[Partition of Ireland|was partitioned]] into [[Northern Ireland]] and the [[Irish Free State]] (the latter in turn becoming [[\u00c9ire]] or Ireland after adopting [[Constitution of Ireland|a new Constitution]] in 1937, followed by [[Republic of Ireland Act 1948|declaring itself a republic]] in 1949.) Following the initial political upheavals surrounding Partition, a [[Dublin]]-based organisation calling itself the Football Association of the Irish Free State (FAIFS) split from the IFA in 1921 and began organising [[League of Ireland|its own league]] and national football team.<ref>{{Cite book| title=Football Association of Ireland: 75 years | first=Peter | last=Byrne | year=1996 | location=Dublin | publisher=Sportsworld | isbn = 1-900110-06-7 | page=22}}</ref>\n\nIn 1923, the FAIFS was recognised by [[FIFA]] as the governing body of football in the Irish Free State<ref>{{cite book|title=Football Association of Ireland: 75 years|first=Peter|last=Byrne|year=1996|location=Dublin|publisher=Sportsworld|isbn=1-900110-06-7|page=22}}</ref> and at the [[Ireland at the 1924 Summer Olympics|1924 Summer Olympics]], the Irish Free State made their international debut.

In subsequent years, the status of the Olympic Games football competition was downgraded and as a result, this game is widely regarded as the Irish Free State's first official game. On 25 February 1934, the Irish Free State made their [[FIFA World Cup]] debut, drawing 4\u20134 with [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]] at Dalymount Park in a [[1934 FIFA World Cup qualification|1934 FIFA World Cup qualifier]]. [[Paddy Moore]] scored all four of the Free State's goals and became the first player ever to score four goals in a World Cup game.<ref name=\"soccer-ireland.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.soccer-ireland.com/irish-football-results/1940-1959.htm |title=Republic of Ireland Soccer Team Match Results : Result of Irish Football Matches 1940 to 1959 |website=Soccer-Ireland.com |accessdate=26 June 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Ireland (1937\u20131952)===\nAfter 1936, they reverted to the designation \"Football Association of Ireland\" and began to refer to their team as ''\u00c9ire'' or \"Ireland\". During this entire period, there were two Irish international football teams, chosen by two rival Associations. Both Associations, the Northern Ireland-based IFA and the Irish Free State-based FAI claimed jurisdiction over the whole of Ireland and considered themselves entitled to select players from the entire island. At least 38 [[Dual Irish international footballers|dual internationals]] were selected to represent both teams,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nifootball.blogspot.com/2006/10/dual-internationalists.html|title=List of Dual Internationalists|publisher=Northern Ireland's Footballing Greats|first=Jonny|last=Dewart|date=23 October 2006}}</ref> however the overwhelming majority of these were Southerners who also agreed to play for the IFA team, with only a bare handful \"crossing the border\" in the other direction.\n\nA [[England v Ireland (1949)|2\u20130 win]] over [[England national football team|England]] at [[Goodison Park]] on 21 September 1949 was the first time England suffered a home defeat by a team outside the [[Home Nations|Home Countries]] of [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]], [[Wales national football team|Wales]] and the [[Ireland national football team (IFA)|Ireland]] team run by the Belfast-based [[Irish Football Association|Irish FA]]. FIFA eventually intervened when both teams entered [[1950 FIFA World Cup qualification|1950 World Cup qualification]], the first time they had entered the same competition. Four players \u2013 [[Tom Aherne]], [[Reg Ryan]], [[Davy Walsh]], [[Con Martin]] \u2013 actually played for the two different teams in the same FIFA World Cup tournament.<ref>Ryan, op. cit. pg 59.</ref> All four players concerned had been born in the Irish Free State and made their full international debut in FAI colours before agreeing to represent the IFA team. This may have alarmed the FAI, since they subsequently lobbied FIFA to prevent the IFA from picking Southern-born players (as well as attempting to exert pressure on the players themselves, sometimes through their clubs). FIFA's response was to restrict the eligibility of players on the basis of the (political) border, further ruling in 1953 that neither team could be referred to as ''Ireland'' in competitions which both teams were eligible to enter; i.e., initially the FIFA World Cup and subsequently the European Nations Cup (now the UEFA European Football Championship). FIFA decreed that the FAI team officially be called the ''Republic of Ireland'' while the IFA team was to be named [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]].<ref>Byrne, op. cit., pg 68.</ref>\n\n===Republic of Ireland (1953\u20131968)===\nIn 1953, FIFA renamed the team from \"Ireland\" to \"Republic of Ireland\". The [[1958 FIFA World Cup|1958 World Cup]] qualifiers saw the Republic of Ireland drawn with England. In their home game against England, [[Alf Ringstead]] put the hosts 1\u20130 up before [[John Atyeo]] equalised in the last minute to salvage a 1\u20131 draw for England. Under the rules of the day, a win for the Republic of Ireland would have meant a play-off with England for a place in the World Cup.<ref name=\"soccer-ireland.com\" />\n\nAfter reaching the quarter-finals of the [[1964 European Nations' Cup]], the Republic of Ireland were drawn to face [[Spain national football team|Spain]] and [[Syria national football team|Syria]] in [[1966 FIFA World Cup qualification|1966 World Cup qualifying]]. Despite Syria's withdrawal, this was still considered a qualifying group with the Irish winning 1\u20130 at home and losing 4\u20131 away.

This was the first instance of a player born outside the Republic being selected to play for the national team due to having an Irish parent. Since then, many of the Republic's most prominent players have been born in England, including [[Mark Lawrenson]], [[David O'Leary]], [[John Aldridge]], [[Tony Cascarino]] and [[David Kelly (association footballer)|David Kelly]]. A number of players born in Scotland, including [[Ray Houghton]], have since represented the Republic due to having Irish parentage. The selection rules were later relaxed to allow for the selection of players with an Irish grandparent.\n\n===Wilderness (1969\u20131985)===\nIn 1969, the FAI appointed [[Mick Meagan]] as the first permanent manager of the national side. His two years in charge were marked by exceptionally poor results, however with the team losing five out of six matches and gaining just one point in their [[1970 FIFA World Cup qualification|1970 World Cup qualification]], and doing no better in the [[UEFA Euro 1972]] qualifiers, leading to his dismissal. His replacement, [[Liam Tuohy (footballer)|Liam Tuohy]], did a somewhat better in the [[1974 FIFA World Cup qualification|1974 qualification]], and more importantly oversaw major improvements to the national team's training facilities and persuaded many English club sides to end their policies of not releasing Irish players for international games during the domestic season. Ultimately, however, the team still failed to qualify for the World Cup, and Tuohy resigned following a dispute over his wages. [[Johnny Giles]] became the side's first player-manager in the 1970s. This was followed by the debut of a young [[Liam Brady]] and results improved markedly.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soccer-ireland.com/irish-football-results/1970-1979.htm |title=Republic of Ireland Soccer Results: Result of all Irish Football Matches 1970 to 1979 |website=Soccer-Ireland.com |accessdate=26 June 2016}}</ref> The side missed out on the [[1978 FIFA World Cup|1978 World Cup]] by two points, having defeated [[France national football team|France]] at home during [[1978 FIFA World Cup qualification|qualification]].

Between 1924 and 1936, the team competed as the '''Irish Free State''' and from then until 1950, it was referred to by the FAI as '''\u00c9ire''' or '''Ireland'''. In 1953, [[FIFA]] decreed that for competitive matches in tournaments that both Irish teams may enter, the FAI team would be officially called the Republic of Ireland while the [[Irish Football Association|IFA]] team was to be named [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nifootball.blogspot.com/2010/03/northern-ireland-programmes-1882-1889.html|title=NIFG: Northern Ireland Programmes 1968\u20131972|publisher=Northern Ireland's Footballing Greats|first=Jonny|last=Dewart|date=27 March 2010|accessdate=26 June 2016}}</ref> Northern Ireland was allowed to use the title Ireland by FIFA in the Home International Competition until it was discontinued in 1984. The Republic of Ireland was the first nation from outside the United Kingdom to [[1949 England v Ireland football match|defeat]] [[England national football team|England]] at home in a fixture played at [[Goodison Park]], [[Liverpool]], in 1949. The team also reached the quarter-final stage of the [[1964 European Nations' Cup]], where they lost to the eventual champions [[Spain national football team|Spain]].\n\nUnder the guidance of [[Jack Charlton]], the team enjoyed its most successful era, reaching their highest [[FIFA World Rankings|FIFA world ranking]] ever at sixth in August 1993, and qualifying for [[UEFA Euro 1988]] in their first appearance at the [[UEFA European Championship]], reaching the quarter-finals of the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]] in their first ever appearance at the finals, as well as making the last 16 at the [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994 edition]]. Charlton's successor [[Mick McCarthy]] lost out on the next two major tournaments but ultimately qualified for the [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002 World Cup]], making it to the last 16. Under [[Giovanni Trapattoni]], the team narrowly lost out on qualification for the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010]] World Cup during a [[2009 Republic of Ireland v France football matches|controversial play-off]], but went on to qualify for [[UEFA Euro 2012|Euro 2012]].\n\nThe team failed to qualify for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014 World Cup]] in Brazil, marking the end of Trapattoni's tenure as manager. The Republic of Ireland also fell to a record low FIFA ranking of 59th, then a record low of 70th in June 2014.<ref>[https://www.fifa.com/worldranking/rankingtable/index.html FIFA Rankings] FIFA. Retrieved 13 March 2014.</ref> For the next [[UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying|Euro qualifying campaign]] under manager Martin O'Neill, the Republic of Ireland finished third behind [[Germany national football team|Germany]] and [[Poland national football team|Poland]], but went on to qualify for [[UEFA Euro 2016|Euro 2016]] after a 3\u20131 aggregate win over [[Bosnia and Herzegovina national football team|Bosnia and Herzegovina]] in the play-offs. ''The Boys in Green'' reached the Round of 16 stage at that tournament and were knocked out by the hosts and eventual runners-up [[France national football team|France]] after losing 2\u20131.\n\n==History==\n\n===Irish Free State (1924\u20131936)===\nBetween 1882 and 1924, Ireland was represented by [[Ireland national football team (IFA)|a single national football team]] organised by the [[Belfast]]-based [[Irish Football Association]] (IFA). In 1920, Ireland [[Partition of Ireland|was partitioned]] into [[Northern Ireland]] and the [[Irish Free State]] (the latter in turn becoming [[\u00c9ire]] or Ireland after adopting [[Constitution of Ireland|a new Constitution]] in 1937, followed by [[Republic of Ireland Act 1948|declaring itself a republic]] in 1949.) Following the initial political upheavals surrounding Partition, a [[Dublin]]-based organisation calling itself the Football Association of the Irish Free State (FAIFS) split from the IFA in 1921 and began organising [[League of Ireland|its own league]] and national football team.<ref>{{Cite book| title=Football Association of Ireland: 75 years | first=Peter | last=Byrne | year=1996 | location=Dublin | publisher=Sportsworld | isbn = 1-900110-06-7 | page=22}}</ref>\n\nIn 1923, the FAIFS was recognised by [[FIFA]] as the governing body of football in the Irish Free State<ref>{{cite book|title=Football Association of Ireland: 75 years|first=Peter|last=Byrne|year=1996|location=Dublin|publisher=Sportsworld|isbn=1-900110-06-7|page=22}}</ref> and at the [[Ireland at the 1924 Summer Olympics|1924 Summer Olympics]], the Irish Free State made their international debut.

In subsequent years, the status of the Olympic Games football competition was downgraded and as a result, this game is widely regarded as the Irish Free State's first official game. On 25 February 1934, the Irish Free State made their [[FIFA World Cup]] debut, drawing 4\u20134 with [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]] at Dalymount Park in a [[1934 FIFA World Cup qualification|1934 FIFA World Cup qualifier]]. [[Paddy Moore]] scored all four of the Free State's goals and became the first player ever to score four goals in a World Cup game.<ref name=\"soccer-ireland.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.soccer-ireland.com/irish-football-results/1940-1959.htm |title=Republic of Ireland Soccer Team Match Results : Result of Irish Football Matches 1940 to 1959 |website=Soccer-Ireland.com |accessdate=26 June 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Ireland (1937\u20131952)===\nAfter 1936, they reverted to the designation \"Football Association of Ireland\" and began to refer to their team as ''\u00c9ire'' or \"Ireland\". During this entire period, there were two Irish international football teams, chosen by two rival Associations. Both Associations, the Northern Ireland-based IFA and the Irish Free State-based FAI claimed jurisdiction over the whole of Ireland and considered themselves entitled to select players from the entire island. At least 38 [[Dual Irish international footballers|dual internationals]] were selected to represent both teams,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nifootball.blogspot.com/2006/10/dual-internationalists.html|title=List of Dual Internationalists|publisher=Northern Ireland's Footballing Greats|first=Jonny|last=Dewart|date=23 October 2006}}</ref> however the overwhelming majority of these were Southerners who also agreed to play for the IFA team, with only a bare handful \"crossing the border\" in the other direction.\n\nA [[England v Ireland (1949)|2\u20130 win]] over [[England national football team|England]] at [[Goodison Park]] on 21 September 1949 was the first time England suffered a home defeat by a team outside the [[Home Nations|Home Countries]] of [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]], [[Wales national football team|Wales]] and the [[Ireland national football team (IFA)|Ireland]] team run by the Belfast-based [[Irish Football Association|Irish FA]]. FIFA eventually intervened when both teams entered [[1950 FIFA World Cup qualification|1950 World Cup qualification]], the first time they had entered the same competition. Four players \u2013 [[Tom Aherne]], [[Reg Ryan]], [[Davy Walsh]], [[Con Martin]] \u2013 actually played for the two different teams in the same FIFA World Cup tournament.<ref>Ryan, op. cit. pg 59.</ref> All four players concerned had been born in the Irish Free State and made their full international debut in FAI colours before agreeing to represent the IFA team. This may have alarmed the FAI, since they subsequently lobbied FIFA to prevent the IFA from picking Southern-born players (as well as attempting to exert pressure on the players themselves, sometimes through their clubs). FIFA's response was to restrict the eligibility of players on the basis of the (political) border, further ruling in 1953 that neither team could be referred to as ''Ireland'' in competitions which both teams were eligible to enter; i.e., initially the FIFA World Cup and subsequently the European Nations Cup (now the UEFA European Football Championship). FIFA decreed that the FAI team officially be called the ''Republic of Ireland'' while the IFA team was to be named [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]].<ref>Byrne, op. cit., pg 68.</ref>\n\n===Republic of Ireland (1953\u20131968)===\nIn 1953, FIFA renamed the team from \"Ireland\" to \"Republic of Ireland\". The [[1958 FIFA World Cup|1958 World Cup]] qualifiers saw the Republic of Ireland drawn with England. In their home game against England, [[Alf Ringstead]] put the hosts 1\u20130 up before [[John Atyeo]] equalised in the last minute to salvage a 1\u20131 draw for England. Under the rules of the day, a win for the Republic of Ireland would have meant a play-off with England for a place in the World Cup.<ref name=\"soccer-ireland.com\" />\n\nAfter reaching the quarter-finals of the [[1964 European Nations' Cup]], the Republic of Ireland were drawn to face [[Spain national football team|Spain]] and [[Syria national football team|Syria]] in [[1966 FIFA World Cup qualification|1966 World Cup qualifying]]. Despite Syria's withdrawal, this was still considered a qualifying group with the Irish winning 1\u20130 at home and losing 4\u20131 away.

This was the first instance of a player born outside the Republic being selected to play for the national team due to having an Irish parent. Since then, many of the Republic's most prominent players have been born in England, including [[Mark Lawrenson]], [[David O'Leary]], [[John Aldridge]], [[Tony Cascarino]] and [[David Kelly (association footballer)|David Kelly]]. A number of players born in Scotland, including [[Ray Houghton]], have since represented the Republic due to having Irish parentage. The selection rules were later relaxed to allow for the selection of players with an Irish grandparent.\n\n===Wilderness (1969\u20131985)===\nIn 1969, the FAI appointed [[Mick Meagan]] as the first permanent manager of the national side. His two years in charge were marked by exceptionally poor results, however with the team losing five out of six matches and gaining just one point in their [[1970 FIFA World Cup qualification|1970 World Cup qualification]], and doing no better in the [[UEFA Euro 1972]] qualifiers, leading to his dismissal. His replacement, [[Liam Tuohy (footballer)|Liam Tuohy]], did a somewhat better in the [[1974 FIFA World Cup qualification|1974 qualification]], and more importantly oversaw major improvements to the national team's training facilities and persuaded many English club sides to end their policies of not releasing Irish players for international games during the domestic season.

The Republic of Ireland have also played home matches in [[Tolka Park]] (twice) and the [[RDS Arena]] in Dublin as well at the [[Mardyke]] and [[Flower Lodge]] grounds in Cork. These games in Cork were, until 2009, the only two home Irish internationals played outside of Dublin. During the construction of the [[Aviva Stadium]], two friendly games were played in [[Thomond Park]], [[Limerick]], in 2009.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.examiner.ie/breakingnews/sport/trap-aussies-gave-us-a-severe-lesson-422438.html|title=Trap: Aussies gave us 'a severe lesson'|date=13 August 2009|accessdate=13 August 2009|work=Irish Examiner}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2009/0908/live_ireland_southafrica.html|title=Rep of Ireland 1\u20130 South Africa \u2013 Matchtracker|date=8 September 2009|accessdate=8 September 2009|publisher=RT\u00c9 Sport|first=Ed|last=Leahy|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090909220720/http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2009/0908/live_ireland_southafrica.html|archivedate=9 September 2009}}</ref> Two further friendlies were played in the RDS Arena in May 2010.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/irish/8701396.stm|title=Republic of Ireland 2\u20131 Paraguay|date=25 May 2010|accessdate=25 May 2010|publisher=BBC Sport}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/algeria/7779724/Republic-of-Ireland-3-Algeria-0-match-report.html|first=Mark|last=Ogden|title=Republic of Ireland 3 Algeria 0 : match report|date=28 May 2010|accessdate=28 May 2010|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph}}</ref> Ireland played a friendly against [[Belarus national football team|Belarus]] in Cork's 7,000 capacity [[Turners Cross (stadium)|Turners Cross]] stadium in May 2016.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/sport/soccer/euro-2016/euro-2016-teams/republic-of-ireland/irelands-euro-2016-warmup-ends-with-a-whimper-as-belarus-win-in-cork-34762798.html|title=Ireland's Euro 2016 warm-up ends with a whimper as Belarus win in Cork|first=Miguel|last=Delaney|work=Irish Independent|date=31 May 2016|accessdate=1 September 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Media coverage===\nIreland matches currently broadcast by [[Raidi\u00f3 Teilif\u00eds \u00c9ireann]] (RT\u00c9) (qualifiers only), [[Sky Sports]], and highlights on [[Virgin Media Television (Ireland)|Virgin Media Television]].
