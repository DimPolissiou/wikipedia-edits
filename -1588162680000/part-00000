In fact, all three years he was at Colorado he was named to the All-Big 8 First Team.  Because of his dominant play, he was not only named to the 1970s Big 8 All-Decade First Team, but in 1996 he was named to the AP's All-time Big 8 Conference Basketball first team along with [[Wayman Tisdale]] ([[Oklahoma Sooners men's basketball|Oklahoma]]), [[Danny Manning]] ([[Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball|Kansas]]), [[Jo Jo White]] (Kansas) and [[Rolando Blackman]] ([[Kansas State Wildcats men's basketball|Kansas State]]).<ref>Media Guide: Honor Roll http://www.cubuffs.com/fls/600/mbb/2011-12_Info_Guide/110-117_honor_roll.pdf?DB_OEM_ID=600 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150524165324/http://www.cubuffs.com/fls/600/mbb/2011-12_Info_Guide/110-117_honor_roll.pdf?DB_OEM_ID=600 |date=2015-05-24 }}</ref>\n\nColorado has retired the #20 that he wore while in Boulder.\n\n===Individual talents lead the way===\nThe lackluster results of Walseth's latter tenure would become the norm for Colorado over the next two decades. From 1977-78 to 1995-96, the Buffs would only have four winning seasons, and only once would even get to .500 in Big Eight play.\n\nWhile the Buffs struggled record-wise in the '80s and early '90s, they did have a few individual standouts that brought the team national attention.  From 1980\u201384, the Buffs were led by [[Jay Humphries]], an exciting guard who made his mark all over CU's record book in just those three seasons.  On offense, he became the school's all-time [[Assist (basketball)|assist]] leader and also finished fourth all-time in scoring.  Even with that though, Humphries was best known for his defense.

He finished his time as the number three scorer in school history and is still in the top 10 for assists in school history.  Wise & Vandiver led the team on their run to the 1991 NIT Final Four.  It was the school's first postseason appearance since 1969, and when it was said & done, they got to cut down the nets in front of a standing room only crowd at the Events Center before heading to the NIT Final Four in NYC where they ended up third.\n\nThe next player to make his mark on the record books was [[Donnie Boyce]].  The Illinois product spent four years at CU and when he left he was the school's all-time leading scorer with 1,995 points.  He was the first Buff to lead the team in scoring all four years at CU, and only the second Buff to ever do it.  While Boyce was lighting it up, the team struggled.  It appeared that Boyce was finally going to get to play in a postseason tournament in 1995, but he broke his leg in the opening round of the Big Eight Tournament against Oklahoma.  The team went on to earn an NIT bid\u2013their first postseason bid of any sort since 1969\u2013but he was unable to play.\n\n===The Chauncey Billups years===\nThe most beloved player in school history, [[Chauncey Billups]] is usually the first person that people think of when they think Colorado basketball. The three-time winner of Colorado's Mr. Basketball award and a member of the [[McDonald's All-American]] team his senior year, the Denver native could have gone anywhere in the nation to play college ball.<ref>JockBio: Chauncey Billups Biography http://www.jockbio.com/Bios/Billups/Billups_bio.html</ref> Even though it was obvious he wouldn't be staying for the entire four years due to a pro career calling his name, he had no shortage of suitors. With all of that, he decided to stay close to home and enroll at CU.\n\nIn his first year at Colorado, he set a school record for points scored by a freshman and was named to the Big 8 All-Freshman team as well as the All-Big 8 Conference Second Team and the Kansas City Star Big 8 team\u2014an honor that was voted on by the players themselves. Unfortunately, Chauncey's first year in Boulder was filled only with individual accolades as the team underperformed and head coach Joe Harrington was relieved of duties. His sophomore year however, Chauncey was able to get the team going. Behind new head coach Ricardo Patton, and in a new conference (the [[Big 12 Conference]]), Chauncey at one point had led the Buffs to a 14\u20133 record and the #18 ranking in the nation. This team would make the Buffs' first NCAA Tournament appearance in 28 years, and notched their first winning conference record in 24 years. They would upset [[Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball|Indiana]] in the first round before losing to [[North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball|North Carolina]] in the second round. For his work, Chauncey was named not only to the All-[[Big 12 Conference]] First Team, but was named an All-American as well.  Chauncey declared for the [[1997 NBA draft|NBA Draft]], where he was picked third overall by the [[Boston Celtics]], and he went on to play 17 years in the NBA.\n\n===The Buffs enter The Big 12===\nOnce Chauncey left, the Buffs were faced with a rough conference slate, but still managed to have some success behind head coach [[Ricardo Patton]].  Players such as [[Jaquay Walls]] (Big 12 All-Newcomer Team) and Jamahl Mosley helped lead the team to back-to-back NIT bids, but things started to improve once [[David Harrison (basketball)|David Harrison]] showed up on campus for the 2001\u201302 season.  Harrison was named to the Big 12 All-Freshman team and lead the school in scoring, while also setting a school record with a field goal percentage of 63.8% \u2013 good enough for third nationally.<ref>Media Guide: Basketball History/Polls http://www.cubuffs.com/fls/600/mbb/2011-12_Info_Guide/66-71_history_polls.pdf?DB_OEM_ID=600 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131230233434/http://www.cubuffs.com/fls/600/mbb/2011-12_Info_Guide/66-71_history_polls.pdf?DB_OEM_ID=600 |date=2013-12-30 }}</ref>  Harrison had help though in the form of [[St\u00e9phane Pelle]]. Pelle was the first player in 11 years to average a double-double, putting up 12.8 points and 10.8 rebounds per game in the 2001\u201302 season.  The next season, with Harrison & Pelle down low and Michel Morandais coming in to form on the wing, the Buffs won 20 games and capped it off with an NCAA Tournament bid.  They made the NIT the next season after Harrison left early to go into the NBA Draft.\n\n===New all-time scoring leaders===\n[[Richard Roby]] stepped on the CU campus in 2004 and became the first freshman since Chauncey Billups to lead the team in scoring and he ended up joining Donnie Boyce as the only Buffs to lead the team in scoring all four years on campus.  In his sophomore season, Roby & the Buffs won twenty games and ended up in the NIT Tournament, while also being named to the All-Big 12 First Team.  Unfortunately, he was faced with a freshmen laden team the next season, as there were eight first year players (a school record) on the 2006\u201307 squad.  The next season showed improvement and the Buffs became the first team in Big 12 history to be a 12 seed and upset a number 5 seed ([[Baylor Bears basketball|Baylor]]) in the Big 12 Tournament.<ref>Media Guide: Basketball History/Polls http://www.cubuffs.com/fls/600/mbb/2011-12_Info_Guide/66-71_history_polls.pdf?DB_OEM_ID=600 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131230233434/http://www.cubuffs.com/fls/600/mbb/2011-12_Info_Guide/66-71_history_polls.pdf?DB_OEM_ID=600 |date=2013-12-30 }}</ref>  When he finally graduated from CU, he left the school as the all-time leading scorer with 2,001 points\u2014a record that still stands to this day.\n\nBut it is a record that is shared, because during his senior year, he shared time on the floor with a freshman named [[Cory Higgins]] who would one day tie him as the school's all-time leading scorer.  Higgins was more than just a scorer though as during his sophomore year he was one of only 13 players nationally to lead or finish second on his team in five major statistical categories\u2014points, rebounds, assists, steals and blocked shots.<ref>Media Guide: Basketball History/Polls http://www.cubuffs.com/fls/600/mbb/2011-12_Info_Guide/66-71_history_polls.pdf?DB_OEM_ID=600 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131230233434/http://www.cubuffs.com/fls/600/mbb/2011-12_Info_Guide/66-71_history_polls.pdf?DB_OEM_ID=600 |date=2013-12-30 }}</ref>  Higgins also found a way to rank nationally in steals, free throw percentage and scoring as well.

In his first season in Boulder, Boyle led the Buffs to a school-record 18 home wins and their highest Big 12 finish (t-5th) since 2005\u201306. CU ranked first in the Big 12 and fifth nationally in free throw percentage (77.8) for the 2010\u201311 season. Boyle's efficient attack also ranked 12th nationally in scoring (79.6 ppg) and 19th nationally in field goal percentage (47.3).\n\nBoyle earned National Coach of the Week honors (Hoops Report, Jan. 10\u201316) after leading the Buffs to a 3\u20130 conference start, including wins over No. 9/8 Missouri and No. 21/20 Kansas State. The win over the Wildcats gave CU its first road win over a nationally ranked opponent since defeating No. 20 Texas Tech in January 1997. For the season, CU defeated four ranked teams, including a comeback of 22 points down (ranking second all-time in school history) to upset No. 5/5 Texas, 91\u201389.<ref>Tad Boyle CUBUFFS.com BIO {{cite web |url=http://www.cubuffs.com/ViewArticle.dbml?SPSID=3897&SPID=257&DB_LANG=C&DB_OEM_ID=600&ATCLID=204940904&Q_SEASON=2011 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-03-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110829152526/http://www.cubuffs.com/ViewArticle.dbml?SPSID=3897&SPID=257&DB_LANG=C&DB_OEM_ID=600&ATCLID=204940904&Q_SEASON=2011 |archivedate=2011-08-29 }}</ref> Despite having a very solid season and getting to the semi-finals of the conference tournament, Boyle and the Buffs were snubbed of a bid in the NCAA tournament.

He was able turn all of this into his second 24 win season in a row, a Pac-12 tournament championship and a trip to the NCAA Tournament as a #11 seed where CU advanced to the round of 32 for the first time in 15 years after beating #6 seed [[UNLV Runnin' Rebels basketball|UNLV]] 68\u201364 in Albuquerque.

The CEC opened in 1979 and the first game played there was the CU Men's Basketball team hosting the USSR basketball team.  The largest crowd ever to witness a game was on December 5, 2012 when 11,708 people watched CU play [[Colorado State Rams#Basketball|CSU]] (CU won the game 70\u201361).   The facility has also hosted its fair share of concerts as Bob Dylan, U2 and Stevie Wonder are some of the artists to have performed there.<ref>Coors Event Center History http://www.cubuffs.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=600&ATCLID=119110</ref>\n\nThe facility was originally named the CU Events/Conference Center and cost $7.7 million to build.  In September 1990, it was renamed the Coors Event Center to honor a $5 million gift from the Adolph Coors Foundation.

From 1980\u201384, the Buffs were led by [[Jay Humphries]], an exciting guard who made his mark all over CU's record book in just those three seasons.  On offense, he became the school's all-time [[Assist (basketball)|assist]] leader and also finished fourth all-time in scoring.  Even with that though, Humphries was best known for his defense.

It was the school's first postseason appearance since 1969, and when it was said & done, they got to cut down the nets in front of a standing room only crowd at the Events Center before heading to the NIT Final Four in NYC where they ended up third.\n\nThe next player to make his mark on the record books was [[Donnie Boyce]].  The Illinois product spent four years at CU and when he left he was the school's all-time leading scorer with 1,995 points.  He was the first Buff to lead the team in scoring all four years at CU, and only the second Buff to ever do it.  While Boyce was lighting it up, the team struggled.  It appeared that Boyce was finally going to get to play in a postseason tournament in 1995, but he broke his leg in the opening round of the Big Eight Tournament against Oklahoma.  The team went on to earn an NIT bid\u2013their first postseason bid of any sort since 1969\u2013but he was unable to play.\n\n===The Chauncey Billups years===\nThe most beloved player in school history, [[Chauncey Billups]] is usually the first person that people think of when they think Colorado basketball. The three-time winner of Colorado's Mr. Basketball award and a member of the [[McDonald's All-American]] team his senior year, the Denver native could have gone anywhere in the nation to play college ball.<ref>JockBio: Chauncey Billups Biography http://www.jockbio.com/Bios/Billups/Billups_bio.html</ref> Even though it was obvious he wouldn't be staying for the entire four years due to a pro career calling his name, he had no shortage of suitors. With all of that, he decided to stay close to home and enroll at CU.\n\nIn his first year at Colorado, he set a school record for points scored by a freshman and was named to the Big 8 All-Freshman team as well as the All-Big 8 Conference Second Team and the Kansas City Star Big 8 team\u2014an honor that was voted on by the players themselves. Unfortunately, Chauncey's first year in Boulder was filled only with individual accolades as the team underperformed and head coach Joe Harrington was relieved of duties. His sophomore year however, Chauncey was able to get the team going. Behind new head coach Ricardo Patton, and in a new conference (the [[Big 12 Conference]]), Chauncey at one point had led the Buffs to a 14\u20133 record and the #18 ranking in the nation. This team would make the Buffs' first NCAA Tournament appearance in 28 years, and notched their first winning conference record in 24 years. They would upset [[Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball|Indiana]] in the first round before losing to [[North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball|North Carolina]] in the second round. For his work, Chauncey was named not only to the All-[[Big 12 Conference]] First Team, but was named an All-American as well.  Chauncey declared for the [[1997 NBA draft|NBA Draft]], where he was picked third overall by the [[Boston Celtics]], and he went on to play 17 years in the NBA.\n\n===The Buffs enter The Big 12===\nOnce Chauncey left, the Buffs were faced with a rough conference slate, but still managed to have some success behind head coach [[Ricardo Patton]].  Players such as [[Jaquay Walls]] (Big 12 All-Newcomer Team) and Jamahl Mosley helped lead the team to back-to-back NIT bids, but things started to improve once [[David Harrison (basketball)|David Harrison]] showed up on campus for the 2001\u201302 season.

Pelle was the first player in 11 years to average a double-double, putting up 12.8 points and 10.8 rebounds per game in the 2001\u201302 season.  The next season, with Harrison & Pelle down low and Michel Morandais coming in to form on the wing, the Buffs won 20 games and capped it off with an NCAA Tournament bid.  They made the NIT the next season after Harrison left early to go into the NBA Draft.\n\n===New all-time scoring leaders===\n[[Richard Roby]] stepped on the CU campus in 2004 and became the first freshman since Chauncey Billups to lead the team in scoring and he ended up joining Donnie Boyce as the only Buffs to lead the team in scoring all four years on campus.  In his sophomore season, Roby & the Buffs won twenty games and ended up in the NIT Tournament, while also being named to the All-Big 12 First Team.  Unfortunately, he was faced with a freshmen laden team the next season, as there were eight first year players (a school record) on the 2006\u201307 squad.  The next season showed improvement and the Buffs became the first team in Big 12 history to be a 12 seed and upset a number 5 seed ([[Baylor Bears basketball|Baylor]]) in the Big 12 Tournament.<ref>Media Guide: Basketball History/Polls http://www.cubuffs.com/fls/600/mbb/2011-12_Info_Guide/66-71_history_polls.pdf?DB_OEM_ID=600 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131230233434/http://www.cubuffs.com/fls/600/mbb/2011-12_Info_Guide/66-71_history_polls.pdf?DB_OEM_ID=600 |date=2013-12-30 }}</ref>  When he finally graduated from CU, he left the school as the all-time leading scorer with 2,001 points\u2014a record that still stands to this day.\n\nBut it is a record that is shared, because during his senior year, he shared time on the floor with a freshman named [[Cory Higgins]] who would one day tie him as the school's all-time leading scorer.  Higgins was more than just a scorer though as during his sophomore year he was one of only 13 players nationally to lead or finish second on his team in five major statistical categories\u2014points, rebounds, assists, steals and blocked shots.<ref>Media Guide: Basketball History/Polls http://www.cubuffs.com/fls/600/mbb/2011-12_Info_Guide/66-71_history_polls.pdf?DB_OEM_ID=600 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131230233434/http://www.cubuffs.com/fls/600/mbb/2011-12_Info_Guide/66-71_history_polls.pdf?DB_OEM_ID=600 |date=2013-12-30 }}</ref>  Higgins also found a way to rank nationally in steals, free throw percentage and scoring as well.  For his junior year, Higgins got some more help with the arrival of freshman guard [[Alec Burks]].  Higgins & Burks became the first tandem to net over 500 points in the same season since the 1990\u201391 campaign<ref>Media Guide: Basketball History/Polls http://www.cubuffs.com/fls/600/mbb/2011-12_Info_Guide/66-71_history_polls.pdf?DB_OEM_ID=600 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131230233434/http://www.cubuffs.com/fls/600/mbb/2011-12_Info_Guide/66-71_history_polls.pdf?DB_OEM_ID=600 |date=2013-12-30 }}</ref> and were rewarded as Higgins was named to the All-Big 12 Third Team and Burks was named All-Big 12 Freshman of the Year.\n\n===The Tad Boyle era===\n[[Tad Boyle]] was named the 18th coach in University of Colorado men's basketball history on April 19, 2010. In his first season in Boulder, Boyle led the Buffs to a school-record 18 home wins and their highest Big 12 finish (t-5th) since 2005\u201306. CU ranked first in the Big 12 and fifth nationally in free throw percentage (77.8) for the 2010\u201311 season. Boyle's efficient attack also ranked 12th nationally in scoring (79.6 ppg) and 19th nationally in field goal percentage (47.3).\n\nBoyle earned National Coach of the Week honors (Hoops Report, Jan. 10\u201316) after leading the Buffs to a 3\u20130 conference start, including wins over No. 9/8 Missouri and No. 21/20 Kansas State. The win over the Wildcats gave CU its first road win over a nationally ranked opponent since defeating No. 20 Texas Tech in January 1997. For the season, CU defeated four ranked teams, including a comeback of 22 points down (ranking second all-time in school history) to upset No. 5/5 Texas, 91\u201389.<ref>Tad Boyle CUBUFFS.com BIO {{cite web |url=http://www.cubuffs.com/ViewArticle.dbml?SPSID=3897&SPID=257&DB_LANG=C&DB_OEM_ID=600&ATCLID=204940904&Q_SEASON=2011 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-03-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110829152526/http://www.cubuffs.com/ViewArticle.dbml?SPSID=3897&SPID=257&DB_LANG=C&DB_OEM_ID=600&ATCLID=204940904&Q_SEASON=2011 |archivedate=2011-08-29 }}</ref> Despite having a very solid season and getting to the semi-finals of the conference tournament, Boyle and the Buffs were snubbed of a bid in the NCAA tournament. CU ended up making it all the way to the NIT semi-finals but lost to [[Alabama Crimson Tide men's basketball|Alabama]].\n\nIn his second season at the helm Tad faced an uphill battle, losing 4 starters, 78% of the scoring and most notably Alec Burks to the NBA (#12 overall pick to the [[Utah Jazz]]). He was able turn all of this into his second 24 win season in a row, a Pac-12 tournament championship and a trip to the NCAA Tournament as a #11 seed where CU advanced to the round of 32 for the first time in 15 years after beating #6 seed [[UNLV Runnin' Rebels basketball|UNLV]] 68\u201364 in Albuquerque. CU's magical run was ended by Baylor in the round of 32, but in just two seasons, Boyle became the most successful post-season coach in the history of Colorado Basketball.\n\n===The AllBuffs.com All-Time Men's Basketball Team===\nThe users on AllBuffs.com had a vote in the summer of 2012 to decide who they considered to be the members of the [https://archive.is/20130116110904/http://www.allbuffs.com/entry.php/182-The-AllBuffs-All-Time-Men-s-Basketball-Team \"All-Time Men's Basketball Team\"] at the University of Colorado.

The first one was in 2008 when the Buffs became the first #12 seed to upset a #5 seed as they beat Baylor in the opening round.  The other one was during their last year in the conference when they beat Iowa State in the opening round and followed that up with their third win of the season over Kansas State before falling just short to Kansas in the semi-finals.\n\n===Pac-12 Conference Tournament===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
