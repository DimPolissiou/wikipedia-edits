[[Historic counties of England|Historically within the]] [[West Riding of Yorkshire]], it has a population of 18,895 according to the 2011 Census.<ref name=\":popstats:\" />\nHorsforth was considered to have the [[largest village in England|largest population of any village in the United Kingdom]] during the latter part of the 19th century. It became part of the City of Leeds metropolitan borough in 1974. In 1999 the community created a civil parish to cover the area, which voted to rename itself a [[town council]]. The area sits within the [[Horsforth (ward)|Horsforth]] [[Ward (electoral subdivision)|ward]] of [[Leeds City Council]], which also includes the southern part of [[Rawdon, West Yorkshire|Rawdon]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.leeds.gov.uk/docs/Horsforth%20ward.pdf | title = Horsforth Ward | publisher = Leeds City Council | year = 2015}}{{dl|date=April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Horsforth Museum.jpg|thumb|left|Horsforth Museum]]\n[[File:HorsforthHomeFront.JPG|thumb|left|The Home Front: Second World War display in Horsforth Museum]]\nHorsforth was recorded in the ''[[Domesday Book]]'' of 1086 as ''Horseford'', ''Horseforde'', ''Hoseforde''; but late-ninth-century coins with the legend ''ORSNA FORD'' and ''OHSNA FORD'' may have come from Horsforth. The name derives from Old English ''hors'' or, to judge from the coins, *''horsa'' ('horse') in the genitive plural form ''horsa''/''horsna'' + ''ford'' '[[ford (river)|ford]]', thus meaning 'horses' ford'.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Watts|first1=Victor|last2=Gelling|first2=John|title=The Cambridge dictionary of English place-names : based on the collections of the English Place-Name Society|date=2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York|isbn=9780521362092|page=3|edition=1}}</ref> This refers to a river crossing on the [[River Aire]] that was subsequently used to transport woollen goods to and from [[Pudsey]], [[Shipley, West Yorkshire|Shipley]] and [[Bradford]]. The original ford was situated off Calverley Lane, but was replaced by a stone footbridge at the turn of the 19th century.\n\nThe three unnamed [[Anglo-Saxons|Saxon]] [[thegns]] that held the land at the [[Norman Conquest|Conquest]] gave way to the king who granted it to lesser [[Normans|Norman]] nobles,<ref>{{cite web|title=Horsforth CA|url=http://www.leeds.gov.uk/docs/horsforth%20caa%20for%20full%20designation-final%20version%20adjusted.pdf|website=Leeds City Council|publisher=LCC|accessdate=26 November 2015|page=5|date=10 November 2008}}</ref> but not long after most of the village came under the control of [[Kirkstall Abbey]], a [[Cistercian]] house founded in 1152 on the bank of the River Aire downstream of Horsforth.\n\nAfter the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] in 1539, Horsforth was partitioned and sold to five families, one of them \u2013 the Stanhopes \u2013 achieved supremacy and controlled the village for the next 300 years. The estate record of the Stanhopes is regarded as one of the most extensive and important collections of its kind, complementing the extensive medieval record associated with Kirkstall Abbey.\n\nUntil the mid 19th century, Horsforth was an agricultural community but it expanded rapidly with the growth of the nearby industrial centre of Leeds. A tannery business was founded at Woodside in about 1820 by the Watson family. It was on the eastern edge of their small farm, and memorialised by ''Tanhouse Hill Lane''. The business became a soap manufacturer and moved to Whitehall Road in Leeds in 1861 and under the chairmanship of [[Joseph Watson, 1st Baron Manton|Joseph Watson junior]], created [[Baron Manton]] in 1922, as Joseph Watson & Sons Ltd, became the largest soap supplier to the northeast of England, second in size nationally only to [[Lever Brothers]].<ref>Wilson, Charles. History of Unilever, London, 1954. Vol.1</ref> Industrially, Horsforth has a history of producing high-quality stone from its quarries. Not only did it supply [[Kirkstall Abbey]] with building materials and millstones in the medieval period, it provided the stone for [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough's]] seafront and sent sandstone from Golden Bank Quarry as far afield as [[Egypt]]. Situated on Horsforth Beck (Oil Mill Beck) were mills serving the textile trade.\n\nBetween 1861 and 1862, there was an outbreak of [[typhoid]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=htEDAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA406&dq=horsforth&as_brr=1&output=html |title=Epidemiological Society of London, '&#39;Transactions'&#39; (in GoogleBooks) |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=10 January 2012}}</ref>\n\nHorsforth was historically a [[Township (England)|township]] in the parish of [[Guiseley]].  It became a separate civil parish in 1866.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/unit/10434233/relationships|title=Horsforth CP/Ch through time - Census tables with data for the Parish-level Unit|author=|date=|website=www.visionofbritain.org.uk|accessdate=8 April 2018}}</ref>  In the late-19th century it achieved note as the village with the largest population in England. Railways, turnpike roads, tramways and the nearby canal made it a focus for almost all forms of public and commercial transport and it became a dormitory suburb of Leeds. The civil parish became Horsforth [[Urban district (Great Britain and Ireland)|Urban District]] in 1894.  The parish and urban district were abolished in 1974 and merged into the new [[City of Leeds]] metropolitan district. In 1999 Horsforth became a civil parish and a [[Parish councils in England|parish council]] was created, which exercised its right to declare Horsforth a town.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.horsforthtowncouncil.gov.uk/Horsforth-TC/Horsforth_Town_Council_17751.aspx | title=Horsforth Town Council | accessdate = 28 July 2015}}</ref>\n\nHorsforth Village Museum<ref name=HM>{{cite web|url=http://www.ukattraction.com/yorkshire/horsforth-museum.htm |title=Horsforth Museum, Leeds \u2013 Yorkshire |publisher=UK Attraction |accessdate=10 January 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302002845/http://www.ukattraction.com/yorkshire/horsforth-museum.htm |archivedate=2 March 2012 |df=dmy }}</ref> has collections and displays illustrating aspects of life set against the backdrop of the changing role of the village.\n\nDuring the [[Second World War]] the \u00a3241,000 required to build the corvette HMS ''Aubrietia'' was raised entirely by the people of Horsforth.

[[Historic counties of England|Historically within the]] [[West Riding of Yorkshire]], it has a population of 18,895 according to the 2011 Census.<ref name=\":popstats:\" />\nHorsforth was considered to have the [[largest village in England|largest population of any village in the United Kingdom]] during the latter part of the 19th century. It became part of the City of Leeds metropolitan borough in 1974. In 1999 the community created a civil parish to cover the area, which voted to rename itself a [[town council]]. The area sits within the [[Horsforth (ward)|Horsforth]] [[Ward (electoral subdivision)|ward]] of [[Leeds City Council]], which also includes the southern part of [[Rawdon, West Yorkshire|Rawdon]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.leeds.gov.uk/docs/Horsforth%20ward.pdf | title = Horsforth Ward | publisher = Leeds City Council | year = 2015}}{{dl|date=April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Horsforth Museum.jpg|thumb|left|Horsforth Museum]]\n[[File:HorsforthHomeFront.JPG|thumb|left|The Home Front: Second World War display in Horsforth Museum]]\nHorsforth was recorded in the ''[[Domesday Book]]'' of 1086 as ''Horseford'', ''Horseforde'', ''Hoseforde''; but late-ninth-century coins with the legend ''ORSNA FORD'' and ''OHSNA FORD'' may have come from Horsforth. The name derives from Old English ''hors'' or, to judge from the coins, *''horsa'' ('horse') in the genitive plural form ''horsa''/''horsna'' + ''ford'' '[[ford (river)|ford]]', thus meaning 'horses' ford'.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Watts|first1=Victor|last2=Gelling|first2=John|title=The Cambridge dictionary of English place-names : based on the collections of the English Place-Name Society|date=2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York|isbn=9780521362092|page=3|edition=1}}</ref> This refers to a river crossing on the [[River Aire]] that was subsequently used to transport woollen goods to and from [[Pudsey]], [[Shipley, West Yorkshire|Shipley]] and [[Bradford]]. The original ford was situated off Calverley Lane, but was replaced by a stone footbridge at the turn of the 19th century.\n\nThe three unnamed [[Anglo-Saxons|Saxon]] [[thegns]] that held the land at the [[Norman Conquest|Conquest]] gave way to the king who granted it to lesser [[Normans|Norman]] nobles,<ref>{{cite web|title=Horsforth CA|url=http://www.leeds.gov.uk/docs/horsforth%20caa%20for%20full%20designation-final%20version%20adjusted.pdf|website=Leeds City Council|publisher=LCC|accessdate=26 November 2015|page=5|date=10 November 2008}}</ref> but not long after most of the village came under the control of [[Kirkstall Abbey]], a [[Cistercian]] house founded in 1152 on the bank of the River Aire downstream of Horsforth.\n\nAfter the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] in 1539, Horsforth was partitioned and sold to five families, one of them \u2013 the Stanhopes \u2013 achieved supremacy and controlled the village for the next 300 years. The estate record of the Stanhopes is regarded as one of the most extensive and important collections of its kind, complementing the extensive medieval record associated with Kirkstall Abbey.\n\nUntil the mid 19th century, Horsforth was an agricultural community but it expanded rapidly with the growth of the nearby industrial centre of Leeds. A tannery business was founded at Woodside in about 1820 by the Watson family. It was on the eastern edge of their small farm, and memorialised by ''Tanhouse Hill Lane''. The business became a soap manufacturer and moved to Whitehall Road in Leeds in 1861 and under the chairmanship of [[Joseph Watson, 1st Baron Manton|Joseph Watson junior]], created [[Baron Manton]] in 1922, as Joseph Watson & Sons Ltd, became the largest soap supplier to the northeast of England, second in size nationally only to [[Lever Brothers]].<ref>Wilson, Charles. History of Unilever, London, 1954. Vol.1</ref> Industrially, Horsforth has a history of producing high-quality stone from its quarries. Not only did it supply [[Kirkstall Abbey]] with building materials and millstones in the medieval period, it provided the stone for [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough's]] seafront and sent sandstone from Golden Bank Quarry as far afield as [[Egypt]]. Situated on Horsforth Beck (Oil Mill Beck) were mills serving the textile trade.\n\nBetween 1861 and 1862, there was an outbreak of [[typhoid]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=htEDAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA406&dq=horsforth&as_brr=1&output=html |title=Epidemiological Society of London, '&#39;Transactions'&#39; (in GoogleBooks) |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=10 January 2012}}</ref>\n\nHorsforth was historically a [[Township (England)|township]] in the parish of [[Guiseley]].

Railways, turnpike roads, tramways and the nearby canal made it a focus for almost all forms of public and commercial transport and it became a dormitory suburb of Leeds. The civil parish became Horsforth [[Urban district (Great Britain and Ireland)|Urban District]] in 1894.  The parish and urban district were abolished in 1974 and merged into the new [[City of Leeds]] metropolitan district. In 1999 Horsforth became a civil parish and a [[Parish councils in England|parish council]] was created, which exercised its right to declare Horsforth a town.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.horsforthtowncouncil.gov.uk/Horsforth-TC/Horsforth_Town_Council_17751.aspx | title=Horsforth Town Council | accessdate = 28 July 2015}}</ref>\n\nHorsforth Village Museum<ref name=HM>{{cite web|url=http://www.ukattraction.com/yorkshire/horsforth-museum.htm |title=Horsforth Museum, Leeds \u2013 Yorkshire |publisher=UK Attraction |accessdate=10 January 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302002845/http://www.ukattraction.com/yorkshire/horsforth-museum.htm |archivedate=2 March 2012 |df=dmy }}</ref> has collections and displays illustrating aspects of life set against the backdrop of the changing role of the village.\n\nDuring the [[Second World War]] the \u00a3241,000 required to build the corvette HMS ''Aubrietia'' was raised entirely by the people of Horsforth.

It became one of the last [[boomtown]]s in the [[American frontier]]. The town grew significantly into the mid-1880s as the local [[Silver mining|mines]] produced $40 to $85 million in silver [[bullion]], the largest productive silver district in Arizona. Its population grew from 100 to around 14,000 in less than seven years. It is best known as the site of the [[Gunfight at the O.K. Corral]] and presently draws most of its revenue from tourism.\n\nThe town was established on a [[mesa]] above the Goodenough Mine. Within two years of its founding, although far distant from any other [[metropolitan area]], Tombstone had a bowling alley, four churches, an [[Ice house (building)|ice house]], a school, two banks, three newspapers, and an ice cream parlor, alongside 110 saloons, 14 gambling halls, and numerous [[dance hall]]s and [[brothel]]s. All of these businesses were situated among and atop many silver mines. The gentlemen and ladies of Tombstone attended operas presented by visiting acting troupes at the [[Schieffelin Hall]] opera house, while the [[miner]]s and [[cowboy]]s saw shows at the [[Bird Cage Theatre]] and brothel.\n\nUnder the surface were tensions that grew into deadly conflict. The mining capitalists and the townspeople were largely [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] from the [[Union (American Civil War)|Northern states]]. Many of the ranchers (some of whom\u2014like the [[Newman Haynes Clanton|Clantons]]\u2014were also [[cattle rustler|rustler]]s or other criminal varieties) were [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] sympathizers and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]]. The booming city was only {{convert|30|mi}} from the U.S.\u2013Mexico border and was an open market for [[cattle raiding|cattle stolen]] from ranches in [[Sonora]], Mexico, by a loosely organized band of [[outlaw]]s known as [[Cochise County Cowboys|The Cowboys]]. The Earp brothers\u2014[[Wyatt Earp|Wyatt]], [[Virgil Earp|Virgil]] and [[Morgan Earp|Morgan]]\u2014as well as [[Doc Holliday]], arrived in December 1879 and mid-1880. The Earps had ongoing conflicts with Cowboys [[Ike Clanton|Ike]] and [[Billy Clanton]], [[Frank McLaury|Frank]] and [[Tom McLaury]], and [[Billy Claiborne]]. The Cowboys repeatedly threatened the Earps over many months until the conflict escalated into a shootout on October 26, 1881. The historic gunfight is often portrayed as occurring at the [[O.K. Corral (building)|O.K. Corral]], though it actually occurred a short distance away in an empty lot on Fremont Street.\n\nIn the mid-1880s, the silver mines penetrated the water table and the mining companies made significant investments in specialized pumps. A fire in 1886 destroyed the Grand Central [[Hoist (device)|hoist]] and the [[Pumping station|pumping plant]], and it was unprofitable to rebuild the costly pumps. The city nearly became a [[ghost town]], saved only because it was the Cochise County [[county seat|seat]] until 1929. The city's population dwindled to a low of 646 in 1910, but grew to 1,380 by 2010.<ref name=\"Census 2010\">{{cite web| url=http://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/DEC/10_DP/G001/1600000US0474400| archive-url=https://archive.today/20200212180650/http://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/DEC/10_DP/G001/1600000US0474400| url-status=dead| archive-date=February 12, 2020| title=Geographic Identifiers: 2010 Demographic Profile Data (G001): Tombstone city, Arizona| publisher=U.S. Census Bureau, American Factfinder| accessdate=June 12, 2014}}</ref> Tombstone has frequently been noted on lists of [[Place names considered unusual|unusual place names]].<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0Ia7Rga26OkC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA5#v=onepage&q&f=false | title=You Live Where?: Interesting and Unusual Facts about where We Live | publisher=iUniverse | author=Thompson, George E. | year=2009 | pages=5}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yzk9g9TuMNYC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA15#v=onepage&q&f=false | title=A Place Called Peculiar: Stories about Unusual American Place-Names | publisher=Courier Dover Publications | author=Gallant, Frank K. | year=2012 | pages=15}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Tombstone (probably in 1881).jpg|thumb|left|Tombstone in 1881 by [[C.

In addition, because many of the lawsuits required expert analysis of the underground, many geologists and engineers found employment in Tombstone and settled there.

The classic Cochise County Courthouse and adjacent gallows yard in Tombstone are preserved as a museum.\n\n[[File:Saloon girls on Allen Street.jpg|Saloon ladies on Allen Street in 2006|thumb|left]]\n\nCurrently, [[tourism]] and western memorabilia are the main commercial enterprises; a July 2005 [[CNN]] article notes that Tombstone receives approximately 450,000 tourist visitors each year. This is about 300 tourists/year for each permanent resident. In contrast to its heyday, when it featured saloons open 24 hours and numerous houses of prostitution, Tombstone is now a staid community with few businesses open late. Tombstone and surrounding areas have a variety of lodging options, restaurants, and attractions. The town is located near other historic sites of interest, including [[Bisbee, Arizona|Bisbee]] and the [[San Pedro Riparian National Conservation Area|San Pedro Riparian area]].{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} Tombstone is a short drive away from [[Sierra Vista, Arizona|Sierra Vista]], which is considered the shopping hub of Cochise County.<ref>{{cite web |last=Hess |first=Bill |title=Hobby Lobby celebrates enthusiastic opening |url=http://www.svherald.com/content/bill-hess/2013/09/09/359184 |work=Sierra Vista Herald |publisher=Wick Communications |accessdate=September 14, 2013 }}</ref>\n\nEast Allen Street is the center of Tombstone's tourist attractions, featuring three blocks of shaded boardwalks lined with gift shops, saloons, and eateries.

The [[Rosa banksiae|Lady Banksia rose]] originated in Scotland. Mary Gee was the wife of mining engineer Henry Gee, who worked for the Vizina Mining Co. Mary's family sent the homesick bride a box of rooted cuttings from her home country. She planted one of the roses by the patio of the Vizina Mining Company's boarding house, the first adobe building in town, located at 4th and Toughnut Street across from the later site of the railroad depot. She and Henry lived in the boarding house when they first arrived in Tombstone.<ref name=plantguide/><ref name=rosey/>\n\nThe building was later renamed the Cochise House Hotel, and from 1909 to 1936 it was known as the Arcade Hotel.  By the 1930s, the rose bush had grown to shade the entire patio and became a popular site for tourists.  The hotel was later renamed the Rose Tree Inn and then the Rose Tree Inn Museum. The museum curator tells visitors that all Banks roses growing in the U.S. today are descendants of the Tombstone rose.<ref name=plantguide>{{cite web|title=Lady Banks Rose Rosa banksiae|url=http://www.botanical-journeys-plant-guides.com/lady-banks-rose.html|accessdate=26 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 1940, the Lady Banksia rose covered about {{convert|4000|sqft|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite book|title=Arizona: A State Guide |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=er6V4QzaeyMC&pg=PA249&lpg=PA249|publisher=North American Book Dist LLC |date=January 1, 1940 |page=249}}</ref> {{asof|2014}}, the rose bush covered more than {{convert|8000|sqft|abbr=on}} of the roof and garden trellis of the inn, and has a {{convert|12|ft|abbr=on}} circumference trunk.

It became one of the last [[boomtown]]s in the [[American frontier]]. The town grew significantly into the mid-1880s as the local [[Silver mining|mines]] produced $40 to $85 million in silver [[bullion]], the largest productive silver district in Arizona. Its population grew from 100 to around 14,000 in less than seven years. It is best known as the site of the [[Gunfight at the O.K. Corral]] and presently draws most of its revenue from tourism.\n\nThe town was established on a [[mesa]] above the Goodenough Mine. Within two years of its founding, although far distant from any other [[metropolitan area]], Tombstone had a bowling alley, four churches, an [[Ice house (building)|ice house]], a school, two banks, three newspapers, and an ice cream parlor, alongside 110 saloons, 14 gambling halls, and numerous [[dance hall]]s and [[brothel]]s. All of these businesses were situated among and atop many silver mines. The gentlemen and ladies of Tombstone attended operas presented by visiting acting troupes at the [[Schieffelin Hall]] opera house, while the [[miner]]s and [[cowboy]]s saw shows at the [[Bird Cage Theatre]] and brothel.\n\nUnder the surface were tensions that grew into deadly conflict. The mining capitalists and the townspeople were largely [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] from the [[Union (American Civil War)|Northern states]]. Many of the ranchers (some of whom\u2014like the [[Newman Haynes Clanton|Clantons]]\u2014were also [[rustler]]s or other criminal varieties) were [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] sympathizers and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]]. The booming city was only {{convert|30|mi}} from the U.S.\u2013Mexico border and was an open market for [[cattle raiding|cattle stolen]] from ranches in [[Sonora]], Mexico, by a loosely organized band of [[outlaw]]s known as [[Cochise County Cowboys|The Cowboys]]. The Earp brothers\u2014[[Wyatt Earp|Wyatt]], [[Virgil Earp|Virgil]] and [[Morgan Earp|Morgan]]\u2014as well as [[Doc Holliday]], arrived in December 1879 and mid-1880. The Earps had ongoing conflicts with Cowboys [[Ike Clanton|Ike]] and [[Billy Clanton]], [[Frank McLaury|Frank]] and [[Tom McLaury]], and [[Billy Claiborne]]. The Cowboys repeatedly threatened the Earps over many months until the conflict escalated into a shootout on October 26, 1881. The historic gunfight is often portrayed as occurring at the [[O.K. Corral (building)|O.K. Corral]], though it actually occurred a short distance away in an empty lot on Fremont Street.\n\nIn the mid-1880s, the silver mines penetrated the water table and the mining companies made significant investments in specialized pumps. A fire in 1886 destroyed the Grand Central [[Hoist (device)|hoist]] and the [[Pumping station|pumping plant]], and it was unprofitable to rebuild the costly pumps. The city nearly became a [[ghost town]], saved only because it was the Cochise County [[county seat|seat]] until 1929. The city's population dwindled to a low of 646 in 1910, but grew to 1,380 by 2010.<ref name=\"Census 2010\">{{cite web| url=http://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/DEC/10_DP/G001/1600000US0474400| archive-url=https://archive.today/20200212180650/http://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/DEC/10_DP/G001/1600000US0474400| url-status=dead| archive-date=February 12, 2020| title=Geographic Identifiers: 2010 Demographic Profile Data (G001): Tombstone city, Arizona| publisher=U.S. Census Bureau, American Factfinder| accessdate=June 12, 2014}}</ref> Tombstone has frequently been noted on lists of [[Place names considered unusual|unusual place names]].<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0Ia7Rga26OkC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA5#v=onepage&q&f=false | title=You Live Where?: Interesting and Unusual Facts about where We Live | publisher=iUniverse | author=Thompson, George E. | year=2009 | pages=5}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yzk9g9TuMNYC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA15#v=onepage&q&f=false | title=A Place Called Peculiar: Stories about Unusual American Place-Names | publisher=Courier Dover Publications | author=Gallant, Frank K. | year=2012 | pages=15}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Tombstone (probably in 1881).jpg|thumb|left|Tombstone in 1881 by [[C.

Former Territorial Governor [[Anson P. K.

Lots were immediately sold on Allen Street for $5.00 each. The town soon had some 40 cabins and about 100 residents. At the town's founding in March 1879, it took its name from Schieffelin's initial mining claim. By fall 1879, a few thousand hardy souls were living in a canvas and matchstick camp perched amidst the richest silver strike in the Arizona Territory.<ref name=nhlsnom/>\n\nWhen [[Cochise County, Arizona|Cochise County]] was formed from the eastern portion of Pima County on February 1, 1881, Tombstone became the new [[county seat]]. [[Telegraph]] service to the town was established that same month.

The mine and business owners, miners, townspeople and city lawmen including the Earps were largely [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] from the [[Union (American Civil War)|Northern states]].

The Mexican government taxed these items heavily and smugglers earned a handsome profit by sneaking these products across the border. The illegal cross-border smuggling contributed to the lawlessness of the region. Many of these crimes were carried out by outlaw elements labeled \"[[Cochise County Cowboys|Cow-boys]]\", a loosely organized band of friends and acquaintances who teamed up for various crimes and came to each other's aid.

Deputy U.S. Marshal [[Virgil Earp]] and his temporary deputies and brothers [[Wyatt Earp]] and [[Morgan Earp]] pursued the Cowboys suspected of the murders. This set off a chain of events that culminated on October 26, 1881, in a gunfight in a vacant lot owned by famous photographer C. S. Fly near, not in or at the O. K.

Two months later on the evening of December 28, 1881, [[Virgil Earp]] was ambushed and seriously wounded on the streets of Tombstone by hidden assailants shooting from the second story of an unfinished building. Although identified, the suspects provided witnesses who supplied alibis, and the men were not prosecuted. On March 18, 1882, [[Morgan Earp]] was killed by a shot that struck his spine as Wyatt looked on late at night while Morgan was playing billiards at 10:00&nbsp;p.m. at Campbell & Hatch on Tombstone's main drag \u2014 Allen Street \u2014 in the heart of its still current downtown. Once again, the assailants were named but escaped arrest due to legal technicalities. Wyatt Earp, concluding that legal justice was out of reach, but with warrants obtained via the U. S. Marshal's Office, led a [[posse comitatus (common law)|posse]] that pursued and killed four of the men they held responsible on what became known as the [[Earp Vendetta Ride]].<ref name=\"historynet\">{{cite web |url=http://www.historynet.com/wyatt-earps-vendetta-posse.htm |title=Wyatt Earp's Vendetta Posse |date=January 29, 2007 |accessdate=February 18, 2011}}</ref>\n\nAfter the Earp family left Arizona in early 1882, shortly after the attempted murder of Tombstone Marshal Virgil Earp on 28 December 1881, following the infamous gunfight of 26 October 1881, and murder of Deputy Marshal Morgan Earp on 18 March 1882, much of the Cowboy related crime subsided.

As a result, [[lawyer]]s began to settle in Tombstone and became even wealthier than the miners and those who financed the mining. In addition, because many of the lawsuits required expert analysis of the underground, many geologists and engineers found employment in Tombstone and settled there. In the end, a thorough mapping of the area was completed by experts which resulted in maps documenting Tombstone's mining claims better than any other mining district of the West.<ref>Faulk, O.

As the fastest growing [[boomtown]] in the American Southwest, the silver industry and attendant wealth attracted many professionals and merchants who brought their wives and families. With them came churches and ministers. They brought a [[Victorian America|Victorian]] sensibility and became the town's elite.

It destroyed the Grand Hotel and the Tivoli Saloon before it jumped Fremont Street, destroying more than 100 businesses and most of the business district. Lacking enough water to put out the flames, buildings in the fire's path were dynamited to deny the fire fuel.

The fire was so intense that the metal components of the Cornish engine melted and warped. The headworks of the main mine shaft were also destroyed. Shortly afterward, the price of silver slid to 90 cents an ounce. The mines that remained operational laid off workers.

Tombstone was saved from becoming a [[ghost town]] partly because it remained the Cochise County seat until 1929, when county residents voted to move county offices to nearby [[Bisbee, Arizona|Bisbee]]. The classic Cochise County Courthouse and adjacent gallows yard in Tombstone are preserved as a museum.\n\n[[File:Saloon girls on Allen Street.jpg|Saloon ladies on Allen Street in 2006|thumb|left]]\n\nCurrently, [[tourism]] and western memorabilia are the main commercial enterprises; a July 2005 [[CNN]] article notes that Tombstone receives approximately 450,000 tourist visitors each year. This is about 300 tourists/year for each permanent resident. In contrast to its heyday, when it featured saloons open 24 hours and numerous houses of prostitution, Tombstone is now a staid community with few businesses open late.

The [[Rosa banksiae|Lady Banksia rose]] originated in Scotland. Mary Gee was the wife of mining engineer Henry Gee, who worked for the Vizina Mining Co. Mary's family sent the homesick bride a box of rooted cuttings from her home country. She planted one of the roses by the patio of the Vizina Mining Company's boarding house, the first adobe building in town, located at 4th and Toughnut Street across from the later site of the railroad depot.

During the field testing of the [[Mini E]], which has an accelerator that recharges the battery in this way, and consists of brakes that only apply to the rear wheels, BMW has learned that drivers tend to rely on the engine brake: around 75% of all deceleration maneuvers are initiated without the brake pedal in urban traffic areas.<ref name=Wards0510/> BMW also expected the i3 to use the same type of battery and powertrain that is being tested in the [[BMW ActiveE]] trials.<ref name=\"AutoMag2010\">{{cite web|url=http://www.automobilemag.com/green/news/1005_rich_steinberg_interview/|title=Green: Rich Steinberg Interview: Electric Bimmer Man|publisher=[[Automobile Magazine]]|author=Joe Lorio|date=May 2010|accessdate=13 February 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe [[concept car|prototype]] presented at the [[International Motor Show Germany#2011|2011 International Motor Show Germany]] had a {{convert|22|kWh|abbr=on}} [[lithium-ion battery]] pack that is expected to deliver between {{Convert|80|to|100|mi|abbr=on|order=flip}} and the battery was fully charged in about four hours with the 240-volt charging unit.

The school had maintained its own campus, faculty, and degree program since 1869, and it has become more ecumenical beginning in the mid-19th century. Since the 1970s, it has been affiliated with the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]] [[Berkeley Divinity School]] and has housed the [[Yale Institute of Sacred Music|Institute of Sacred Music]], which offers separate degree programs. In July 2017, a two-year process of formal affiliation was completed, with the addition of [[Andover Newton Seminary at Yale Divinity School|Andover Newton Seminary]] joining the school.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Divinity College at Yale before 1870, Memories of Yale life and men, 1854-1899 (1903).jpg|thumb|200px|The Divinity College dormitory on the [[Old Campus (Yale University)|Old Campus]], completed in 1836]]\nTheological education was the earliest academic purpose of Yale University. When [[Yale College]] was founded in 1701, it was as a college of religious training for [[Congregationalist]] ministers in [[Connecticut Colony]], designated in its charter as a school \"wherein Youth may be instructed in the Arts & Sciences who through the blessing of Almighty God may be fitted for Publick employment both in Church & Civil State.\"  A professorship of divinity was established in 1746. In 1817, the occupant of the divinity chair, [[Eleazar Thompson Fitch]], supported a student request to endow a theological curriculum, and five years later a separate {{nowrap|'''Yale Theological Seminary'''}}<ref>{{citation |title=History of Higher Education Annual: 1997 |p=[https://books.google.com.hk/books?id=vgQaGJt9OTQC&pg=PA94 94] }}.</ref> was founded by the [[Yale Corporation]].<ref name=\"Catalogue\">{{cite book |title=A General Catalogue of the Divinity School of Yale College: A Brief Biographical Record of Its Members in The First Half Century of Its Existence as A Distinct Department |url=https://archive.org/details/generalcatalogue00yalerich |publisher=Tuttle, Morehouse, & Taylor |year=1873 |location=New Haven}}</ref> In the same motion, [[Second Great Awakening]] theologian [[Nathaniel William Taylor]] was appointed to become the first Dwight Professor of Didactic Theology.<ref name=\"YUL\">{{cite web |title=Yale Divinity School Milestones, 1822-2012 |publisher=Yale University Library |date=23 October 2012 |url=http://divinity-adhoc.library.yale.edu/Exhibits/YDSMilestones.htm |accessdate=16 November 2015}}</ref> Taylor was considered the \"central figure\" in the school's founding, and he was joined in 1826 by [[Josiah Willard Gibbs, Sr.]], a scholar of sacred languages and lexicographer [[Chauncey A. Goodrich]] in 1839.<ref name=\"YUL\"/> A dedicated student dormitory, Divinity College, was completed on the college's [[Old Campus (Yale University)|Old Campus]] in 1836, but the department had no permanent classrooms or offices until several years after the end of the [[American Civil War]].\n\n[[File:Old Divinity School, Yale University, New Haven, Conn.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Divinity Hall, occupied from 1870 to 1931, viewed from the [[New Haven Green]].]]\nAfter a significant period of enrollment decline, the school began fundraising from alumni for new faculty and facilities.<ref name=\"YUL\"/> Divinity Hall was constructed on the present-day site of [[Calhoun College|Grace Hopper College]] between 1869 and 1871, featuring two classroom wings and a chapel.<ref name=\"YUL\"/>  Around the time of the new campus' construction came the arrival of new faculty, including [[James M.

While Berkeley retains its [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopal Church]] connection, its students are admitted by and fully enrolled as members of Yale Divinity School. [[The Jonathan Edwards Center at Yale University]], a division of the Divinity School, maintains a large collection of primary source materials about [[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Jonathan Edwards]], a 1720 Yale alumnus. The Yale Institute of Sacred Music (ISM) is jointly-affiliated with the Divinity School and School of Music. It offers programs in choral conducting, organ performance, voice, and church music studies, and in liturgical studies and religion and the arts.\n\nIn May 2016, [[Andover Newton Theological School]] president [[Martin Copenhaver]] announced that Andover Newton would begin a process of formal affiliation with the Divinity School over the next two years. In the 2016\u201317 academic year, a cohort of faculty relocated to New Haven teaching students and launching pilot initiatives focused on congregational ministry education, while Andover Newton continued to operate in Massachusetts over the next two years. In July 2017, a formal affiliation was signed, resulting in smaller Andover Newton functioning as a unit within Yale Divinity School, similar to its arrangement with Berkeley.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://divinity.yale.edu/news/yds-and-andover-newton-sign-historic-agreement|title=YDS and Andover Newton sign historic agreement|date=July 20, 2017|website=Yale Divinity School}}</ref>\n\n== Leadership ==\n[[Gregory E.

The school had maintained its own campus, faculty, and degree program since 1869, and it has become more ecumenical beginning in the mid-19th century. Since the 1970s, it has been affiliated with the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]] [[Berkeley Divinity School]] and has housed the [[Yale Institute of Sacred Music|Institute of Sacred Music]], which offers separate degree programs. In July 2017, a two-year process of formal affiliation was completed, with the addition of [[Andover Newton Seminary at Yale Divinity School|Andover Newton Seminary]] joining the school.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Divinity College at Yale before 1870, Memories of Yale life and men, 1854-1899 (1903).jpg|thumb|200px|The Divinity College dormitory on the [[Old Campus (Yale University)|Old Campus]], completed in 1836]]\nTheological education was the earliest academic purpose of Yale University. When [[Yale College]] was founded in 1701, it was as a college of religious training for [[Congregationalist]] ministers in [[Connecticut Colony]], designated in its charter as a school \"wherein Youth may be instructed in the Arts & Sciences who through the blessing of Almighty God may be fitted for Publick employment both in Church & Civil State.\"  A professorship of divinity was established in 1746. In 1817, the occupant of the divinity chair, [[Eleazar Thompson Fitch]], supported a student request to endow a theological curriculum, and five years later a separate {{nowrap|'''Yale Theological Seminary'''}}<ref>{{citation |title=History of Higher Education Annual: 1997 |p=[https://books.google.com.hk/books?id=vgQaGJt9OTQC&pg=PA94 94] }}.</ref> was founded by the [[Yale Corporation]].<ref name=\"Catalogue\">{{cite book |title=A General Catalogue of the Divinity School of Yale College: A Brief Biographical Record of Its Members in The First Half Century of Its Existence as A Distinct Department |url=https://archive.org/details/generalcatalogue00yalerich |publisher=Tuttle, Morehouse, & Taylor |year=1873 |location=New Haven}}</ref> In the same motion, [[Second Great Awakening]] theologian [[Nathaniel William Taylor]] was appointed to become the first Dwight Professor of Didactic Theology.<ref name=\"YUL\">{{cite web |title=Yale Divinity School Milestones, 1822-2012 |publisher=Yale University Library |date=23 October 2012 |url=http://divinity-adhoc.library.yale.edu/Exhibits/YDSMilestones.htm |accessdate=16 November 2015}}</ref> Taylor was considered the \"central figure\" in the school's founding, and he was joined in 1826 by [[Josiah Willard Gibbs, Sr.]], a scholar of sacred languages and lexicographer [[Chauncey A. Goodrich]] in 1839.<ref name=\"YUL\"/> A dedicated student dormitory, Divinity College, was completed on the college's [[Old Campus (Yale University)|Old Campus]] in 1836, but the department had no permanent classrooms or offices until several years after the end of the [[American Civil War]].\n\n[[File:Old Divinity School, Yale University, New Haven, Conn.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Divinity Hall, occupied from 1870 to 1931, viewed from the [[New Haven Green]].]]\nAfter a significant period of enrollment decline, the school began fundraising from alumni for new faculty and facilities.<ref name=\"YUL\"/> Divinity Hall was constructed on the present-day site of [[Calhoun College|Grace Hopper College]] between 1869 and 1871, featuring two classroom wings and a chapel.<ref name=\"YUL\"/>  Around the time of the new campus' construction came the arrival of new faculty, including [[James M. Hoppin]], [[George Edward Day (language scholar)|George Edward Day]], [[George Park Fisher]], and [[Leonard Bacon]].<ref name=\"YUL\"/> The first Bachelor of Divinity (B.D.) was conferred in 1867, and the department became a separate School of Divinity in 1869.<ref name=\"Catalogue\"/> The school remained across from Old Campus until 1929, when a new campus was constructed on the northern edge of the university campus, at the top of [[Prospect Hill, New Haven|Prospect Hill]].\n\n[[Berkeley Divinity School]] affiliated with Yale Divinity School in 1971, and in the same year the university replaced the B.D. with a [[Master of Divinity]] program.  While Berkeley retains its [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopal Church]] connection, its students are admitted by and fully enrolled as members of Yale Divinity School. [[The Jonathan Edwards Center at Yale University]], a division of the Divinity School, maintains a large collection of primary source materials about [[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Jonathan Edwards]], a 1720 Yale alumnus. The Yale Institute of Sacred Music (ISM) is jointly-affiliated with the Divinity School and School of Music. It offers programs in choral conducting, organ performance, voice, and church music studies, and in liturgical studies and religion and the arts.\n\nIn May 2016, [[Andover Newton Theological School]] president [[Martin Copenhaver]] announced that Andover Newton would begin a process of formal affiliation with the Divinity School over the next two years. In the 2016\u201317 academic year, a cohort of faculty relocated to New Haven teaching students and launching pilot initiatives focused on congregational ministry education, while Andover Newton continued to operate in Massachusetts over the next two years. In July 2017, a formal affiliation was signed, resulting in smaller Andover Newton functioning as a unit within Yale Divinity School, similar to its arrangement with Berkeley.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://divinity.yale.edu/news/yds-and-andover-newton-sign-historic-agreement|title=YDS and Andover Newton sign historic agreement|date=July 20, 2017|website=Yale Divinity School}}</ref>\n\n== Leadership ==\n[[Gregory E.

The Shades moved to [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], where the band's name changed to \"Little Daddy & the Bachelors\". They recorded a single, \"Too Much Monkey Business\" / \"Junior's Jerk\". Together with bandmember Bobby Taylor, Chong opened a Vancouver nightclub in 1963.  Formerly the Alma Theatre, they called it \"Blue Balls\". They brought in the [[Ike & Tina Turner]] Revue, which had never been to Vancouver before.

They recorded their debut album, an [[eponymous]] release, and their debut single, the Tommy Chong co-composition, \"Does Your Mama Know About Me,\" which peaked at number 29 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].<ref name=\"allmusic\" /> While on tour in Chicago for a short time, the band followed opening act [[the Jackson 5]].

Chong was fired by [[Chris Clark (singer)|Chris Clark]] and Motown producer [[Johnny Bristol]] for arriving late to the gig. Later, when Berry Gordy told Chong that he wasn't fired after all, that it had been a mistake, Chong said he wanted to stay fired. \"I said I want to become a Berry Gordy, I don't want to just work for a Berry Gordy.

It premiered theatrically at the New York Film Forum in New York City and won awards. His time in prison was also a main point in his book, \"The I Chong\".\n\n===Controversy===\n[[File:Tommy Chong by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|Chong in 2006]]\nWhile government officials denied that Chong was treated any differently from the other defendants, supporters felt his celebrity status was being used against him. Chong's publicist [[Brandie Knight]] said the Chong family was shocked by the raid. \"We've done everything the right way, and the government is saying there is no right way,\" Knight said.<ref>{{cite news|title=U.S. raids firms selling items used by pot smokers / Ashcroft blames Internet for paraphernalia|url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2003-02-25/news/17477256_1_operation-headhunter-head-shops-bongs/2|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110301163234/http://articles.sfgate.com/2003-02-25/news/17477256_1_operation-headhunter-head-shops-bongs|archivedate=March 1, 2011| newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]}}</ref> Supporters started the \"Free Tommy Chong!\" movement that called for his release. They questioned why Chong was prosecuted rather than his son Paris Chong, who was CEO of the business. They also pointed to the disparity in sentences between Chong's and those of other defendants and the DEA tactics used in the investigation.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\nParis Chong had started Nice Dreams in 1999. He was never charged with his crimes in relation to the investigation as part of a plea bargain. When asked why the government had focused on Chong rather than his son the CEO, US Attorney Mary Beth Buchanan said that \"Tommy Chong was the more responsible corporate officer because he financed and marketed the product.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n\nOf the 55 people who were subjects of the investigation, Chong was the only one without previous convictions who received jail time.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" /> When questioned on the sentencing, U.S. Attorney Mary Beth Buchanan noted that Chong had never gone to trial and made a plea bargain. She said, \"He was a relatively new player, but he had the ability to market products like no other.\"<ref name=\"Tommy Chong's Bongs\">{{cite magazine |author=Greg Beato | title=Tommy Chong's Bongs| date=May 2004 | magazine= Reason Magazine| url= http://www.reason.com/news/show/29137.html}}</ref>\n\nDuring its investigation of Nice Dreams, federal agents posed as head-shop owners from [[Beaver County, Pennsylvania|Beaver County]] in western Pennsylvania. They asked Paris Chong to sell them [[Water pipe percolator|pipes]] through the mail to a fictitious shop in the town of [[Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania|Beaver Falls]], {{convert|31|mi|km}} from Pittsburgh. Paris Chong had been prohibited from selling to Pittsburgh or anywhere in [[Western Pennsylvania]] because of the successful federal prosecution of Akhil Kumar Mishra and his wife, Rajeshwari, who had two head shops in the city.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" /> Accounts differ as to who in Nice Dreams went against Chong's prohibition, or even if it had been made up by the defense, but the sales did take place to the agents. This enabled the U.S. Attorney to show jurisdiction in Pennsylvania for Chong's illegal activities, as opposed to California, which was the base for Nice Dreams.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n\n===Aftermath===\nIn December 2004, Chong was to appear in an off-Broadway show entitled ''[[The Marijuana-Logues]]'', a parody of [[Eve Ensler]]'s ''[[The Vagina Monologues]]''. His parole officer barred him from the show and the tour was cancelled, as audience members were smoking pot during performances.

The search was one of nine conducted for [[Operation True Test]], an investigation being led by Buchanan, still the U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Pennsylvania. It targeted companies that sell so-called \"masking products,\" intended to help drug-users pass employer drug tests. No federal law bans such products; they are regulated on a state-by-state basis.

The tour was called ''Light Up America and Canada'' and ''The Felimony Tour'', which referred to major expenses of each. In October 2008, they appeared on ''[[The Howard Stern Show]]'' , the ''[[Opie and Anthony]]'' Show,  and the ''[[Ron and Fez]]'' Show on [[Sirius radio|SIRIUS]]/[[XM Satellite Radio]]. On March 1, 2010, they hosted ''[[WWE Raw]]'' in [[Oklahoma City]]. On March 13, 2011, Cheech & Chong were guest stars on ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode \"[[A Midsummer's Nice Dream]]\", where, during a reunion tour, Homer briefly replaced Chong before the pair reconciled.\n\n[[Cheech Marin]] appeared in Tommy Chong's first dance in the season opener of ''[[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. season 19)|Dancing with the Stars]]'', on September 15, 2014. Around this same time, Cheech and Chong appeared together on the internet-based, pro-marijuana show, [[Getting Doug With High]].\n\n==Personal life==\nIn 1960, Chong married Maxine Sneed in Canada. She is of [[Black Canadian]] and [[Cherokee]] descent. They have two daughters, [[Rae Dawn Chong|Rae Dawn]] (b. 1961) and [[Robbi Chong]] (b. 1965). They divorced in 1970.\n\nIn 1975, Chong married [[Shelby Chong|Shelby Fiddis]] in Los Angeles.

Chong was fired by [[Chris Clark (singer)|Chris Clark]] and Motown producer [[Johnny Bristol]] for arriving late to the gig. Later, when Berry Gordy told Chong that he wasn't fired after all, that it had been a mistake, Chong said he wanted to stay fired. \"I said I want to become a Berry Gordy, I don't want to just work for a Berry Gordy.

He admitted to distributing 7,500 bongs and water pipes on the Internet through Nice Dreams, a family company.
