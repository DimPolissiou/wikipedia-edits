Loughran even achieved a Newspaper Decision over fistic phenom [[Harry Greb]], whom he first met at age 19. As a light heavyweight, he defeated two future world heavyweight champions: [[Max Baer (boxer)|Max Baer]] and [[James J. Braddock]]. Loughran finally fought [[Primo Carnera]] for the heavyweight title but lost a decision.<ref name=\"boxer\"/>\n\nIn an interview late in life, Loughran said his loss to Carnera was a pre-arranged ''fait accompli'': \"I had to knock him out to win, I had to agree to that\".  Footage of the fight is limited and scarce, but Loughran contended he had Carnera in trouble in Rounds 4 and 10, \"but then, when I couldn't finish him, I knew the thing was over\". The decision a foregone conclusion, Tommy Loughran told Peter Heller in April, 1972, \"I beat (Carnera), no question about it\".<ref name=\"Heller\">{{cite book|last1=Heller|first1=Peter|title=In This Corner...!|origyear=1973|location=New York, NY|oclc=803908275|date=1974|publisher=Dell}}</ref>\n\n==Later life==\n[[File:Tommy Loughran Historical Marker 2400 S 17th St Philadelphia PA (DSC 3572).jpg|thumb|left|Historical Marker, 2400 S. 17th St. Philadelphia PA]]\nOn August 22, 1957, he refereed [[Floyd Patterson]]'s defense of his heavyweight title vs. 1956 Olympic gold medalist [[Pete Rademacher]], at [[Sick's Stadium]], [[Seattle]]. The fight was notable in that Rademacher was the first and only fighter to challenge for the heavyweight crown in his professional debut. There were several knockdowns in the fight; Tommy counted out the challenger at 2:57 of the 6th round.\n\nIn the 1960s Loughran retired from having been a long-time, successful broker on Wall Street, where he had dealt in commodities (sugar). He became a keynote speaker, appearing at dinners and banquets, his message an attempt to promote and strengthen the image of boxers and boxing at what for the sport was a troubled time.<ref name=\"Heller\"/> In addition, Tommy lent color commentary to at least one championship bout, [[Carlos Ortiz]] vs. Johnny Bizarro in Pittsburgh, June 20, 1966.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\nIn 2006, the Pennsylvania Historical &amp; Museum Commission raised a historical marker in front of St. Monica's Roman Catholic Church, in his old neighborhood, and reads in part: He boxed during the \"Golden Age of Boxing\" in many weight classes, beating 10 champs in his 18-year career. The \"Philly Phantom\" had a scientific style, built on precision and maneuverability rather than brute force. Considered a gentleman both in and out of the ring. Loughran was devoted to his neighborhood and church here.<ref>[https://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?marker=81590 Historical Marker Database]</ref>\n\n==Notable bouts==\n{| border=\"1\" class=\"wikitable\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"7\"|\n|-  style=\"text-align:center; background:#e3e3e3;\"\n|  style=\"border-style:none none solid solid; \"|'''Result'''\n|  style=\"border-style:none none solid solid; \"|'''Opponent'''\n|  style=\"border-style:none none solid solid; \"|'''Type'''\n|  style=\"border-style:none none solid solid; \"|'''Rd., Time'''\n|  style=\"border-style:none none solid solid; \"|'''Date'''\n|  style=\"border-style:none none solid solid; \"|'''Location'''\n|  style=\"border-style:none none solid solid; \"|'''Notes<ref name=\"boxer\">[http://boxrec.com/list_bouts.php?human_id=11326&cat=boxer&pageID=3 Tommy Loughran's Professional Boxing Record].

Loughran even achieved a Newspaper Decision over fistic phenom [[Harry Greb]], whom he first met at age 19. As a light heavyweight, he defeated two future world heavyweight champions: [[Max Baer (boxer)|Max Baer]] and [[James J. Braddock]]. Loughran finally fought [[Primo Carnera]] for the heavyweight title but lost a decision.<ref name=\"boxer\"/>\n\nIn an interview late in life, Loughran said his loss to Carnera was a pre-arranged ''fait accompli'': \"I had to knock him out to win, I had to agree to that\".  Footage of the fight is limited and scarce, but Loughran contended he had Carnera in trouble in Rounds 4 and 10, \"but then, when I couldn't finish him, I knew the thing was over\". The decision a foregone conclusion, Tommy Loughran told Peter Heller in April, 1972, \"I beat (Carnera), no question about it\".<ref name=\"Heller\">{{cite book|last1=Heller|first1=Peter|title=In This Corner...!|origyear=1973|location=New York, NY|oclc=803908275|date=1974|publisher=Dell}}</ref>\n\n==Later life==\n[[File:Tommy Loughran Historical Marker 2400 S 17th St Philadelphia PA (DSC 3572).jpg|thumb|left|Historical Marker, 2400 S. 17th St. Philadelphia PA]]\nOn August 22, 1957, he refereed [[Floyd Patterson]]'s defense of his heavyweight title vs. 1956 Olympic gold medalist [[Pete Rademacher]], at [[Sick's Stadium]], [[Seattle]]. The fight was notable in that Rademacher was the first and only fighter to challenged for the heavyweight crown in his professional debut. There were several knockdowns in the fight; Tommy counted out the challenger at 2:57 of the 6th round.\n\nIn the 1960s Loughran retired from having been a long-time, successful broker on Wall Street, where he had dealt in commodities (sugar). He became a keynote speaker, appearing at dinners and banquets, his message an attempt to promote and strengthen the image of boxers and boxing at what for the sport was a troubled time.<ref name=\"Heller\"/> In addition, Tommy lent color commentary to at least one championship bout, [[Carlos Ortiz]] vs. Johnny Bizarro in Pittsburgh, June 20, 1966.{{cn|date=June 2017}}\n\nIn 2006, the Pennsylvania Historical &amp; Museum Commission raised a historical marker in front of St. Monica's Roman Catholic Church, in his old neighborhood, and reads in part: He boxed during the \"Golden Age of Boxing\" in many weight classes, beating 10 champs in his 18-year career. The \"Philly Phantom\" had a scientific style, built on precision and maneuverability rather than brute force. Considered a gentleman both in and out of the ring. Loughran was devoted to his neighborhood and church here.<ref>[https://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?marker=81590 Historical Marker Database]</ref>\n\n==Notable bouts==\n{| border=\"1\" class=\"wikitable\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"7\"|\n|-  style=\"text-align:center; background:#e3e3e3;\"\n|  style=\"border-style:none none solid solid; \"|'''Result'''\n|  style=\"border-style:none none solid solid; \"|'''Opponent'''\n|  style=\"border-style:none none solid solid; \"|'''Type'''\n|  style=\"border-style:none none solid solid; \"|'''Rd., Time'''\n|  style=\"border-style:none none solid solid; \"|'''Date'''\n|  style=\"border-style:none none solid solid; \"|'''Location'''\n|  style=\"border-style:none none solid solid; \"|'''Notes<ref name=\"boxer\">[http://boxrec.com/list_bouts.php?human_id=11326&cat=boxer&pageID=3 Tommy Loughran's Professional Boxing Record].

He's told that everyone has been eaten<ref name=\":1\" /> by the girl's father, who is the councilman of Sau-ghara, the big town. At first, the man refuses to believe the, and when he tries to go out, is met with a zombie woman who attacks him. The boy rescues him, and back in the safe house, he decides to save the children and alert the local authorities. When he gets out and enters a school, he sees the principal behaving strangely. The principal suddenly runs away. The children explain that some people, in order to save themselves from getting eaten, started eating others too as the creatures do not eat those who also eat human flesh. As the man watches, the school principal convulses on the ground. The girl's father, who resembles a hairy bear-like creature enters their room. The creature, who has poor vision, is unable to detect the presence of the man and the children until the girl, overcome with love for her father, goes near him, only to be killed and eaten by him. The other two, stunned, don't move for a day, and the monster leaves. The boy has an idea that they take the remains of the girl's body and cover their faces with it so that the zombies will believe that they too are eaters and let them go. The entire place is under surveillance by the girl's father and upon seeing the pair, he checks them personally. He grows suspicious of the boy, who in reaction, eats some of the flesh of the girl. The monster turns to the man, who holds himself, but gets scared and starts running, resulting in him being chased by the zombies. On the way, he falls into a trap. He is thrown the girl's hand, so that he can demonstrate he is one of the creatures .The man refuses to do so, and screams as the girl's father pounces on him, only to wake up from what is supposedly a dream. The man is then confused as he wakes up in the same trap he fell into, and runs towards Bees-ghara. Finding the place deserted and burning, he assumes the worst and cries that he failed to save the children. At the same time, a car comes, full of people who resembled the earlier zombies.The man is taken by them and they tell him that they are people of Sau-ghara and that nobody lives in Bees-ghara after they burned it down because it was a very inferior place.\n\n==== Story 4 - directed by ''[[Karan Johar]]'' ====\nIra ([[Mrunal Thakur]]) agrees to have an arranged marriage with the handsome and wealthy Dhruv ([[Avinash Tiwary]]) who dwells in a house his grandmother built. On the first night after her wedding, she sees her husband seemingly talking to the grandmother who died 20 years ago. Each night after that, the grandmother comes to bid good night to Dhruv, who seems to be the only one who can see her.\n\nIn spite of being an adult, he enjoys playing peek-a-boo with the dead grandmother. Ira questions the maid Shanti (Heeba Shah), and learns that when Dhruv was playing peek-a-boo with her, he accidentally pushed her down the stairs. The grandmother was severely incapacitated and in terrible pain. Despite this, she would make it a point to visit Dhruv each night to wish him a good night. The conversation ends before Ira can learn the circumstances of the grandmother's passing. One night Ira gets tired of Dhruv's attachment to his dead grandmother and storms into her room, still preserved as a shrine her, and screams at the grandmother to leave them alone. The next day, at breakfast, Shanti helps Ira stir her oatmeal. Midway through breakfast, Ira starts having severe stomach cramps and is helped to her bed by Shanti. As Ira lies writhing in pain, Shanti completes their earlier conversation, telling Ira that the grandmother had begged Shanti to put an end to her pain. Being the obedient maid that she is, she mixed castor seeds into her breakfast; thereby, poisoning her to death.\n\nThe viewer is led to understand that Shanti did the same for Ira. Ira wakes up into a brightly lit room and sees the grandmother hovering over her. Confused, Ira asks how it is that she can now see her. She lets Ira know that this is because Ira is now in her world, implying that Ira is dead. Ira then turns her head to see other human forms while the grandmother tells her that those are the others who, like Ira, did not believe in her presence.\n\n== Cast ==\n\n'''Zoya Akhtar's segment'''\n*[[Janhvi Kapoor]] as Sameera\n*[[Surekha Sikri]] as Mrs. Malik\n*[[Vijay Varma]] as Guddu\n\n'''Anurag Kashyap's segment'''\n*[[Sobhita Dhulipala]] as Neha\n*Sagar Arya as Neha's husband\n*Zachary Braz as Ansh\n*Pavail Gulati as Ansh's father\n\n'''Dibakar Banerjee's segment'''\n*Sukant Goel as Visitor\n*Aditya Shetty as Little Boy\n*Eva Ameet Pardeshi as Little Girl\n*[[Gulshan Devaiah]] as girl's Daddy\n\n'''Karan Johar's segment'''\n*[[Mrunal Thakur]] as Ira\n*[[Avinash Tiwary]] as Dhruv\n*[[Jyoti Subhash]] as Dhruv's Granny\n*[[Kitu Gidwani]] as Dhruv's Mother\n*Sumit Tandon as Dhruv's Father\n*Namrata Chopra as Ira's Mother\n*Kusha Kapila as Misha\n*Shataf Figar as Ira's Father\n*Heeba N Shah as Shanti\n\n== Production ==\nIn April 2019, it was announced that [[Anurag Kashyap]], [[Zoya Akhtar]], [[Dibakar Banerjee]], and [[Karan Johar]] will be reuniting again after ''[[Bombay Talkies (film)|Bombay Talkies]]'' and ''[[Lust Stories]]'' for a horror film for [[Netflix]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.financialexpress.com/entertainment/spine-chilling-netflixs-ghost-stories-karan-johar-sanaullah-ansari-dibakar-banerjee-anurag-kashyap-to-reunite/1548761/ |title=Spine chilling!

The grandmother was severely incapacitated and in terrible pain. Despite this, she would make it a point to visit Dhruv each night to wish him a good night. The conversation ends before Ira can learn the circumstances of the grandmother's passing. One night Ira gets tired of Dhruv's attachment to his dead grandmother and storms into her room, still preserved as a shrine her, and screams at the grandmother to leave them alone. The next day, at breakfast, Shanti helps Ira stir her oatmeal. Midway through breakfast, Ira starts having severe stomach cramps and is helped to her bed by Shanti. As Ira lies writhing in pain, Shanti completes their earlier conversation, telling Ira that the grandmother had begged Shanti to put an end to her pain. Being the obedient maid that she is, she mixed castor seeds into her breakfast; thereby, poisoning her to death.\n\nThe viewer is led to understand that Shanti did the same for Ira. Ira wakes up into a brightly lit room and sees the grandmother hovering over her. Confused, Ira asks how it is that she can now see her. She lets Ira know that this is because Ira is now in her world, implying that Ira is dead. Ira then turns her head to see other human forms while the grandmother tells her that those are the others who, like Ira, did not believe in her presence.\n\n== Cast ==\n\n'''Zoya Akhtar's segment'''\n*[[Janhvi Kapoor]] as Sameera\n*[[Surekha Sikri]] as Mrs. Malik\n*[[Vijay Varma]] as Guddu\n\n'''Anurag Kashyap's segment'''\n*[[Sobhita Dhulipala]] as Neha\n*Sagar Arya as Neha's husband\n*Zachary Braz as Ansh\n*Pavail Gulati as Ansh's father\n\n'''Dibakar Banerjee's segment'''\n*Sukant Goel as Visitor\n*Aditya Shetty as Little Boy\n*Eva Ameet Pardeshi as Little Girl\n*[[Gulshan Devaiah]] as girl's Daddy\n\n'''Karan Johar's segment'''\n*[[Mrunal Thakur]] as Ira\n*[[Avinash Tiwary]] as Dhruv\n*[[Jyoti Subhash]] as Dhruv's Granny\n*[[Kitu Gidwani]] as Dhruv's Mother\n*Sumit Tandon as Dhruv's Father\n*Namrata Chopra as Ira's Mother\n*Kusha Kapila as Misha\n*Shataf Figar as Ira's Father\n*Heeba N Shah as Shanti\n\n== Production ==\nIn April 2019, it was announced that [[Anurag Kashyap]], [[Zoya Akhtar]], [[Dibakar Banerjee]], and [[Karan Johar]] will be reuniting again after ''[[Bombay Talkies (film)|Bombay Talkies]]'' and ''[[Lust Stories]]'' for a horror film for [[Netflix]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.financialexpress.com/entertainment/spine-chilling-netflixs-ghost-stories-karan-johar-sanaullah-ansari-dibakar-banerjee-anurag-kashyap-to-reunite/1548761/ |title=Spine chilling!
