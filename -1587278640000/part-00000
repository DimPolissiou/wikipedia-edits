He spent most of his life in Italy, and is one of the earliest important artists, apart from his contemporaries in [[Dutch Golden Age painting]], to concentrate on [[landscape painting]].  His landscapes are usually turned into the [[hierarchy of genres|more prestigious genre]] of [[history painting]]s by the addition of a few small figures, typically representing a scene from the Bible or [[classical mythology]].\n\nBy the end of the 1630s he was established as the leading landscapist in Italy, and enjoyed large fees for his work. These gradually became larger, but with fewer figures, more carefully painted, and produced at a lower rate.<ref name=\"auto\">Kitson, 6</ref> He was not generally an innovator in landscape painting, except in introducing the Sun into many paintings, which had been rare before.  He is now thought of as a French painter, but was born in the independent [[Duchy of Lorraine]],<ref>technically part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]</ref> and almost all his painting was done in Italy; before the late 19th century he was regarded as a painter of the \"Roman School\".<ref name=\"auto\"/> His patrons were also mostly Italian, but after his death he became very popular with English collectors, and the UK retains a high proportion of his works.<ref>Kitson, 6, 9\u201310</ref>\n\n[[File:F0087 Louvre Gellee port au soleil couchant- INV4715 rwk.jpg|thumb|270px|''Seaport at sunset'' (1639), [[Louvre]]]]\nHe was a prolific creator of drawings in pen and very often monochrome [[watercolour]] \"wash\", usually brown but sometimes grey. Chalk is sometimes used for under-drawing, and white highlighting in various media may be employed, much less often other colours such as pink.  These fall into three fairly distinct groups. Firstly there are large numbers of sketches, mostly of landscapes, and apparently very often done at the scene; these have been greatly admired, and influenced other artists. Then there are studies for paintings, of various degrees of finish, many clearly done before or during the process of painting, but others perhaps after that was complete.<ref>Kitson, 8, 32\u201351; Sonnabend & Whiteley, 57\u201383; Fry, 158\u2013160; [https://archive.org/details/drawingsofclaude00lorruoft The drawings of Claude : with an essay by Roger E.

Both Sandrart and Baldinucci knew the painter personally, but at periods some 50 years apart, respectively at the start of his career and shortly before his death.  Sandrart knew him well and lived with him for a while, while Baldinucci was probably not intimate with him, and derived much of his information from Claude's nephew, who lived with the artist.<ref>Sonnabend, Whiteley, 2011, 9.</ref>\n\nClaude's tombstone gives 1600 as his year of birth, but contemporary sources indicate a later date, circa 1604 or 1605.<ref>Sonnabend, Whiteley, 2011, 18.</ref> He was born in the small village of [[Chamagne]], [[Vosges Mountains|Vosges]], then part of the [[Duchy of Lorraine]]. He was the third of five sons of Jean Gell\u00e9e and Anne Padose.\n\nAccording to Baldinucci, Claude's parents both died when he was twelve years old, and he then lived at [[Freiburg]] with an elder brother (Jean Gell\u00e9e). Jean was an artist in inlay and taught Claude the rudiments of drawing. Claude then travelled to Italy, first working for {{ill|Goffredo Wals|fr}} in [[Naples]], then joining the workshop of [[Agostino Tassi]] in Rome.\n\nSandrart's account of Claude's early years, however, is quite different, and modern scholars generally prefer this, or attempt to combine the two. According to Sandrart, Claude did not do well at the village school and was apprenticed to a pastry baker. With a company of fellow cooks and bakers (Lorraine had a high reputation for [[p\u00e2tisserie]]), Claude travelled to Rome and was eventually employed as servant and cook by Tassi, who at some point converted him into an apprentice and taught him drawing and painting. Both Wals and Tassi were landscapists, the former very obscure and producing small works, while Tassi (best known as the rapist of [[Artemisia Gentileschi]]) had a large workshop specializing in [[fresco]] schemes in palaces.<ref>Sonnabend & Whiteley, 9\u201310</ref>\n\nWhile the details of Claude's pre-1620s life remain unclear, most modern scholars agree that he was apprenticed to Wals around 1620\u20131622, and to Tassi from circa 1622/23 to 1625. Finally, Baldinucci reports that in 1625 Claude undertook a voyage back to Lorraine to train with [[Claude Deruet]], working on the backgrounds of a lost fresco scheme, but left his studio comparatively soon, in 1626 or 1627. He returned to Rome and settled in a house in the Via Margutta, near the [[Spanish Steps]] and [[Trinita dei Monti]], remaining in that neighbourhood for the rest of his life.<ref name=\"SonnabendWhiteley\">Sonnabend, Whiteley, 2011, 19.</ref>\n\nOn his travels, Claude briefly stayed in [[Marseilles]], [[Genoa]], and [[Venice]], and had the opportunity to study nature in France, Italy, and [[Bavaria]]. Sandrart met Claude in the late 1620s and reported that by then the artist had a habit of sketching outdoors, particularly at dawn and at dusk, making oil studies on the spot. The first dated painting by Claude, ''Landscape with Cattle and Peasants'' ([[Philadelphia Museum of Art]]) from 1629,<ref name=\"auto2\">Kitson, 13</ref> already shows well-developed style and technique. In the next few years his reputation was growing steadily, as evidenced by commissions from the French ambassador in Rome (1633) and the King of Spain (1634\u201335). Baldinucci reported that a particularly important commission came from [[Guido Bentivoglio|Cardinal Bentivoglio]], who was impressed by the two landscapes Claude painted for him, and recommended the artist to [[Pope Urban VIII]].<ref>Sonnabend, Whiteley, 2011, 28.</ref> Four paintings were made for the Pope in 1635\u20131638, two large and two small on copper.<ref>Kitson, Nos. 9, 10 and 14, all these now in England, the fourth in France.</ref>\n\nFrom this point, Claude's reputation was secured. He went on to fulfill many important commissions, both Italian and international. About 1636 he started cataloguing his works, making pen and wash drawings of nearly all his pictures as they were completed, although not always variant versions, and on the back of most drawings he wrote the name of the purchaser, not always sufficiently clearly to identify them now.  This volume Claude named the ''[[Liber Veritatis]]'' (Book of Truth).<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nIn 1650 Claude moved to a neighboring house in Via Paolina (today Via del Babuino), where he lived until his death. The artist never married, but adopted an orphan child, Agnese, in 1658; she may well have been Claude's own daughter with a servant of the same name. Sons of Claude's brothers joined the household in 1662 (Jean, son of Denis Gell\u00e9e) and around 1680 (Joseph, son of Melchior Gell\u00e9e).<ref name=\"SonnabendWhiteley\"/> In 1663 Claude, who suffered much from [[gout]],<ref>Sonnabend, Whiteley, 2011, 15.</ref> fell seriously ill, his condition becoming so serious that he drafted a will, but he managed to recover. He painted less after 1670, but works completed after that date include important pictures such as ''Coast View with Perseus and the Origin of Coral'' (1674), painted for the celebrated collector Cardinal [[Camillo Massimo]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lelorrain.louvre.fr/en/html/ll22.html|title=Claude Lorrain / Coast View with Perseus and the Origin of Coral|first=gaspard from|last=freelancis|publisher=}}</ref> and ''[[Ascanius Shooting the Stag of Sylvia]]'', Claude's last painting, commissioned by Prince [[Lorenzo Onofrio Colonna]], his most important patron in his last years.<ref>Kitson, 31; Wine (1994), 101</ref> The artist died in his house on 23 November 1682. He was originally buried in Trinita dei Monti, but his remains were moved in 1840 to [[San Luigi dei Francesi]].<ref name=\"SonnabendWhiteley\"/>\n\nAt his death, he owned only four of his paintings, but most of his drawings.  Apart from the ''Liber Veritatis'' many of these were in bound volumes, the inventory mentioning 12 bound books and a large \"case\" or folder of loose sheets. Five or six large bound volumes were left to his heirs including a ''Tivoli Book'', ''Campagna Book'', ''Early Sketchbook'', and an \"animal album\", all now broken up and dispersed, though as the sheets were numbered their contents have been largely reconstructed by scholars.<ref>Sonnabend & Whiteley, 59; Kitson, 34\u201335</ref>\n\n==Style and subjects==\n[[File:Claude Lorrain - An Artist Studying from Nature - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''An Artist Studying from Nature'', 1639 ([[Cincinnati Art Museum]])]]\n\n===Influences===\nClaude's choice of both style and subject matter grew out of a tradition of landscape painting in Italy, mostly Rome, led by northern artists trained in the style of [[Northern Mannerism]]. [[Matthijs Bril]] had arrived in Rome from [[Antwerp]] around 1575, and was soon joined by his brother [[Paul Bril|Paul]]. Both specialized in landscapes, initially as backgrounds in large [[fresco]]s, a route apparently also taken by Lorrain some decades later. Matthijz died at 33 but Paul remained active in Rome until after Claude's arrival there, although any meeting between them has not been recorded. [[Hans Rottenhammer]] and [[Adam Elsheimer]] were other northern landscapists associated with Bril, who had left Rome long before.\n\nThese artists introduced the genre of small [[cabinet picture]]s, often on copper, where the figures were dominated by their landscape surroundings, which were very often dense woodland placed not far behind figures in the foreground.  Paul Bril had begun to paint larger pictures where the size and balance between the elements, and the type of landscape used, is closer to Claude's work in the future, with an extensive open view behind much of the width of the picture.\n\nAlong with other seventeenth-century artists working in Rome, Claude was also influenced by the new interest in the genre of landscape that emerged in the mid-to-late sixteenth century within the Veneto; starting with the Venetian born painter [[Domenico Campagnola]] and the Dutch artist resident in both Padua and Venice, [[Lambert Sustris]]. Interest in landscape first emerged in Rome in the work of their Brescian pupil [[Girolamo Muziano]], who earned the nickname in the city of Il giovane dei paesi (the young man of the landscapes).<ref>Patrizia Tosini, Girolamo Muziano: dalla Maniera alla Natura, 1532\u20131592 (Ugo Bozzi Editore: 2008), pp. 17\u201377. </ref>  Following the integration of this tradition with other Northern sources, Bolognese artists such as [[Domenichino]], who was in Rome from 1602, painted a number of \"Landscape with...\" subjects, drawn from mythology, religion and literature, as well as genre scenes.  These usually have an open vista in one part of the composition, as well as a steep hill in another. Even when the action between the few small figures is violent, the landscape gives an impression of serenity.  The compositions are careful and balanced, and look forward to Claude's.  The ''[[Landscape with the Flight into Egypt (Carracci)|Landscape with the Flight into Egypt]]'' by [[Annibale Carracci]] (c. 1604) is one of the best Italian landscapes of the start of the century,<ref>Wine (2001), 33, 63; Wine (1994), 22\u201324</ref> but perhaps more a forerunner of Poussin than Claude.\n\n===Early works===\n[[File:'Landscape with a Piping Shepherd' by Claude Lorrain, c. 1629-32, Norton Simon Museum.JPG|thumb|''Landscape with a Piping Shepherd'', c. 1629\u20131632]]\n\nClaude's earliest paintings draw from both these groups, being mostly rather smaller than later. [[Agostino Tassi]] may have been a pupil of Paul Bril, and his influence is especially evident in Claude's earliest works, at a larger size, while some small works of about 1631 recall Elsheimer.<ref name=\"auto2\"/> Initially Claude often includes more figures than was typical of his predecessors, despite his figure drawing being generally recognised as \"notoriously feeble\", as [[Roger Fry]] put it.<ref>Fry, 155</ref>\n\nMore often than later, the figures were mere genre [[staffage]]: shepherds, travellers, and sailors, as appropriate for the scene. In the early 1630s the first religious and mythological subjects appear, with a [[Flight into Egypt]] probably of 1631,<ref>Kitson, 13, [[Duke of Rutland]]</ref> and a [[Judgement of Paris]],<ref>Kitson, 14\u201315</ref> both very common subjects in the \"Landscape with..\" genre.  The pair to the latter is a very early harbour scene, already with tall classical buildings, a type of composition Claude was to use for the rest of his career.<ref>Kitson, 15; Sonnabend & Whiteley, Nos. 1 and 2; both [[Duke of Buccleuch]]</ref>\n\n==Figures and other non-landscape elements==\n[[File:Ascanius Shooting the Stag of Sylvia 1682 Claude Lorrain.jpg|thumb|300px|left|''[[Landscape with Ascanius Shooting the Stag of Sylvia]]'' (1682), Claude's last painting]]\n\n===Figures===\nAlthough virtually every painting contains figures, even if only a shepherd, their weakness has always been recognised, not least by Claude himself; according to Baldinucci he joked that he charged for his landscapes, but gave the figures for free. According to Sandrart he had made considerable efforts to improve, but without success; certainly there are numerous studies, typically for groups of figures, among his drawings. It has often been thought that he handed the figures in some works over to others to paint, but it is now generally agreed that there are few such cases.  Baldinucci mentions [[Filippo Lauri]] in this context, but he was only born in 1623, and can only have taken on such work from the 1640s at best.<ref>Wine (1994), 12\u201314; Wine (2001), 124 (and note); Blunt, 275, n. 243</ref> The rider in the small ''Landscape with an Imaginary View of Tivoli'' in the [[Courtauld Gallery]] in London, LV 67 and dated 1642, is one of the last of his figures to wear contemporary dress.  Thereafter all of them wore \"pastoral dress\" or the 17th-century idea of ancient dress.<ref>Kitson, 20</ref>\n\nIn his last years his figures tend to become ever more elongated, a process taken to an extreme in his last painting, ''[[Ascanius Shooting the Stag of Sylvia]]'', of which even its owner, the [[Ashmolean Museum]], says \"The hunters are impossibly elongated \u2013 Ascanius, in particular, is absurdly top-heavy\".<ref>[http://www.ashmolean.org/assets/docs/Exhibitions/AshmoleanPressImagesClaudeLorrain.pdf Ashmolean Press summary] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160417112057/http://www.ashmolean.org/assets/docs/Exhibitions/AshmoleanPressImagesClaudeLorrain.pdf |date=17 April 2016 }} for ''Claude Lorrain: The Enchanted Landscape'' in 2011</ref> Its pendant ''View of Carthage with Dido and Aeneas'' (1676, [[Kunsthalle, Hamburg]]) has figures almost as extreme.  With the mid-20th fashion for medical diagnosis through art, it was suggested that Claude had developed an optical condition accounting for such effects, but this has been rejected by doctors and critics alike.\n\n===Architecture===\nClaude only rarely painted topographical scenes showing the Renaissance and Baroque Roman architecture still being created in his lifetime, but often borrowed from it to work up imaginary buildings. Most of the buildings near the foreground of his paintings are grand imagined temples and palaces in a generally classical style, but without the attempt at archaeological rigour seen in Poussin's equivalents. Elements are borrowed and worked up from real buildings, both ancient and modern, and in the absence of much knowledge of what an ancient palace facade looked like, his palaces are more like the late Renaissance Roman palaces many of his clients lived in.  Buildings that are less clearly seen, such as the towers that often emerge above trees in his backgrounds, are often more like the vernacular and medieval buildings he would have seen around Rome.\n\nOne example of a semi-topographic painting with \"modern\" buildings (there are rather more such drawings)<ref>e.g., to mention just those with identifiable buildings, Kitson, #s 39, 62, 63, 70, 71, 72</ref> is ''A View of Rome'' (1632, NG 1319), which seems to represent the view from the roof of Claude's house, including his parish church and initial burialplace of Santa Trinita del Monte, and other buildings such as the [[Quirinal Palace]].  This view takes up the left-hand side of the painting, but on the right, behind a group of genre figures in modern dress (uniquely for Claude, these represent a scene of prostitution in the Dutch [[Merry Company]] tradition), is a statue of Apollo and a [[Roman temple]] portico, both of which are either wholly imaginary or at least not placed in their actual locations.<ref>Wine (2001), 122; [https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/claude-a-view-in-rome image on NG page]</ref>\n[[File:Claude Lorrain 008.jpg|right|thumb|''[[The Embarkation of the Queen of Sheba]]'' (1648), [[National Gallery]]]]\n\nIn a generic ''Seaport'' in the National Gallery (1644, NG5) a palace facade expanding on the gateway built about 1570 between the [[Farnese Gardens]] and the [[Roman Forum]] is next door to the [[Arch of Titus]], here apparently part of another palace.<ref>Wine (1994), 70</ref> Behind that Claude repeats a palace he had used before, that borrows from several buildings in and around Rome, including the [[Villa Farnesina]] and the [[Palazzo Senatorio]].<ref>Wine (2001), 50\u201352; [[:File:A Seaport by Claude.jpg|Image]]</ref> It is pointless to question how [[Ascanius]] finds in [[Latium]] a large stone temple in a fully developed [[Corinthian order]], that has evidently been crumbling into ruins for several centuries.\n\n===Shipping===\nClaude's lack of interest in avoiding anachronism is perhaps seen most clearly in the ships in his harbour scenes.  Whether the subject, and the dress of the figures, is supposed to be contemporary, mythogical or from Roman or medieval history, the large ships are usually the same up-to-date merchant vessels.

Print.</ref>\n\nIn Rome, [[Paul Bril|Bril]], [[Girolamo Muziano]] and [[Federico Zuccaro]] and later [[Elsheimer]], [[Annibale Carracci]] and [[Domenichino]] made landscape vistas pre-eminent in some of their drawings and paintings (as well as [[Da Vinci]] in his private drawings [https://web.archive.org/web/20080205001934/http://www.royalcollection.org.uk/eGallery/object.asp?theme=LANDSCAPE&object=912409&row=0] or [[Baldassarre Peruzzi]] in his decorative frescoes of ''[[vedute]]''); but it might be argued that not until Claude's generation, did landscape completely reflect an aesthetic viewpoint which was seen as completely autonomous in its moral purpose within the cultural world of Rome.\n\nIn this matter of the importance of landscape, Claude was prescient. Living in a pre-Romantic era, he did not depict those uninhabited panoramas that were to be esteemed in later centuries, such as with [[Salvatore Rosa]]. He painted a pastoral world of fields and valleys not distant from castles and towns. If the ocean horizon is represented, it is from the setting of a busy port. Perhaps to feed the public need for paintings with noble themes, his pictures include demigods, heroes and saints, even though his abundant drawings and sketchbooks prove that he was more interested in [[scenography]].\n\nClaude Lorrain was described as kind to his pupils and hard-working; keenly observant, but an unlettered man until his death.\n\n[[John Constable]] described Claude as \"the most perfect landscape painter the world ever saw\", and declared that in Claude's landscape \"all is lovely \u2013 all amiable \u2013 all is amenity and repose; the calm sunshine of the heart\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nga.gov.au/Exhibition/CONSTABLE/Detail.cfm?IRN=143208|title=CONSTABLE : impressions of land, sea and sky \u2013 John CONSTABLE  \u2013 Landscape with goatherd and goats, after Claude|first=National Gallery of|last=Australia|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Claude Glass==\nThe [[Claude glass]], named after Lorrain in England although there is no indication he used or knew of it or anything similar, gave a framed and dark-tinted reflection of a real view, that was supposed to help artists produce works of art similar to his, and tourists to adjust views to a Claudian formula. [[William Gilpin (priest)|William Gilpin]], the inventor of the picturesque ideal, advocated the use of a Claude glass saying, \"they give the object of nature a soft, mellow tinge like the colouring of that Master.\"\n\nClaude glasses were widely used by tourists and amateur artists, who quickly became the targets of satire.

He spent most of his life in Italy, and is one of the earliest important artists, apart from his contemporaries in [[Dutch Golden Age painting]], to concentrate on [[landscape painting]].  His landscapes are usually turned into the [[hierarchy of genres|more prestigious genre]] of [[history painting]]s by the addition of a few small figures, typically representing a scene from the Bible or [[classical mythology]].\n\nBy the end of the 1630s he was established as the leading landscapist in Italy, and enjoyed large fees for his work. These gradually became larger, but with fewer figures, more carefully painted, and produced at a lower rate.<ref name=\"auto\">Kitson, 6</ref> He was not generally an innovator in landscape painting, except in introducing the Sun into many paintings, which had been rare before.  He is now thought of as a French painter, but was born in the independent [[Duchy of Lorraine]],<ref>technically part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]</ref> and almost all his painting was done in Italy; before the late 19th century he was regarded as a painter of the \"Roman School\".<ref name=\"auto\"/> His patrons were also mostly Italian, but after his death he became very popular with English collectors, and the UK retains a high proportion of his works.<ref>Kitson, 6, 9\u201310</ref>\n\n[[File:F0087 Louvre Gellee port au soleil couchant- INV4715 rwk.jpg|thumb|270px|''Seaport at sunset'' (1639), [[Louvre]]]]\nHe was a prolific creator of drawings in pen and very often monochrome [[watercolour]] \"wash\", usually brown but sometimes grey. Chalk is sometimes used for under-drawing, and white highlighting in various media may be employed, much less often other colours such as pink.  These fall into three fairly distinct groups. Firstly there are large numbers of sketches, mostly of landscapes, and apparently very often done at the scene; these have been greatly admired, and influenced other artists. Then there are studies for paintings, of various degrees of finish, many clearly done before or during the process of painting, but others perhaps after that was complete.<ref>Kitson, 8, 32\u201351; Sonnabend & Whiteley, 57\u201383; Fry, 158\u2013160; [https://archive.org/details/drawingsofclaude00lorruoft The drawings of Claude : with an essay by Roger E.

Both Sandrart and Baldinucci knew the painter personally, but at periods some 50 years apart, respectively at the start of his career and shortly before his death.  Sandrart knew him well and lived with him for a while, while Baldinucci was probably not intimate with him, and derived much of his information from Claude's nephew, who lived with the artist.<ref>Sonnabend, Whiteley, 2011, 9.</ref>\n\nClaude's tombstone gives 1600 as his year of birth, but contemporary sources indicate a later date, circa 1604 or 1605.<ref>Sonnabend, Whiteley, 2011, 18.</ref> He was born in the small village of [[Chamagne]], [[Vosges Mountains|Vosges]], then part of the [[Duchy of Lorraine]]. He was the third of five sons of Jean Gell\u00e9e and Anne Padose.\n\nAccording to Baldinucci, Claude's parents both died when he was twelve years old, and he then lived at [[Freiburg]] with an elder brother (Jean Gell\u00e9e). Jean was an artist in inlay and taught Claude the rudiments of drawing. Claude then travelled to Italy, first working for {{ill|Goffredo Wals|fr}} in [[Naples]], then joining the workshop of [[Agostino Tassi]] in Rome.\n\nSandrart's account of Claude's early years, however, is quite different, and modern scholars generally prefer this, or attempt to combine the two. According to Sandrart, Claude did not do well at the village school and was apprenticed to a pastry baker. With a company of fellow cooks and bakers (Lorraine had a high reputation for [[p\u00e2tisserie]]), Claude travelled to Rome and was eventually employed as servant and cook by Tassi, who at some point converted him into an apprentice and taught him drawing and painting. Both Wals and Tassi were landscapists, the former very obscure and producing small works, while Tassi (best known as the rapist of [[Artemisia Gentileschi]]) had a large workshop specializing in [[fresco]] schemes in palaces.<ref>Sonnabend & Whiteley, 9\u201310</ref>\n\nWhile the details of Claude's pre-1620s life remain unclear, most modern scholars agree that he was apprenticed to Wals around 1620\u20131622, and to Tassi from circa 1622/23 to 1625. Finally, Baldinucci reports that in 1625 Claude undertook a voyage back to Lorraine to train with [[Claude Deruet]], working on the backgrounds of a lost fresco scheme, but left his studio comparatively soon, in 1626 or 1627. He returned to Rome and settled in a house in the Via Margutta, near the [[Spanish Steps]] and [[Trinita dei Monti]], remaining in that neighbourhood for the rest of his life.<ref name=\"SonnabendWhiteley\">Sonnabend, Whiteley, 2011, 19.</ref>\n\nOn his travels, Claude briefly stayed in [[Marseilles]], [[Genoa]], and [[Venice]], and had the opportunity to study nature in France, Italy, and [[Bavaria]]. Sandrart met Claude in the late 1620s and reported that by then the artist had a habit of sketching outdoors, particularly at dawn and at dusk, making oil studies on the spot. The first dated painting by Claude, ''Landscape with Cattle and Peasants'' ([[Philadelphia Museum of Art]]) from 1629,<ref name=\"auto2\">Kitson, 13</ref> already shows well-developed style and technique. In the next few years his reputation was growing steadily, as evidenced by commissions from the French ambassador in Rome (1633) and the King of Spain (1634\u201335). Baldinucci reported that a particularly important commission came from [[Guido Bentivoglio|Cardinal Bentivoglio]], who was impressed by the two landscapes Claude painted for him, and recommended the artist to [[Pope Urban VIII]].<ref>Sonnabend, Whiteley, 2011, 28.</ref> Four paintings were made for the Pope in 1635\u20131638, two large and two small on copper.<ref>Kitson, Nos. 9, 10 and 14, all these now in England, the fourth in France.</ref>\n\nFrom this point, Claude's reputation was secured. He went on to fulfill many important commissions, both Italian and international. About 1636 he started cataloguing his works, making pen and wash drawings of nearly all his pictures as they were completed, although not always variant versions, and on the back of most drawings he wrote the name of the purchaser, not always sufficiently clearly to identify them now.  This volume Claude named the ''[[Liber Veritatis]]'' (Book of Truth).<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nIn 1650 Claude moved to a neighboring house in Via Paolina (today Via del Babuino), where he lived until his death. The artist never married, but adopted an orphan child, Agnese, in 1658; she may well have been Claude's own daughter with a servant of the same name. Sons of Claude's brothers joined the household in 1662 (Jean, son of Denis Gell\u00e9e) and around 1680 (Joseph, son of Melchior Gell\u00e9e).<ref name=\"SonnabendWhiteley\"/> In 1663 Claude, who suffered much from [[gout]],<ref>Sonnabend, Whiteley, 2011, 15.</ref> fell seriously ill, his condition becoming so serious that he drafted a will, but he managed to recover. He painted less after 1670, but works completed after that date include important pictures such as ''Coast View with Perseus and the Origin of Coral'' (1674), painted for the celebrated collector Cardinal [[Camillo Massimo]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lelorrain.louvre.fr/en/html/ll22.html|title=Claude Lorrain / Coast View with Perseus and the Origin of Coral|first=gaspard from|last=freelancis|publisher=}}</ref> and ''[[Ascanius Shooting the Stag of Sylvia]]'', Claude's last painting, commissioned by Prince [[Lorenzo Onofrio Colonna]], his most important patron in his last years.<ref>Kitson, 31; Wine (1994), 101</ref> The artist died in his house on 23 November 1682. He was originally buried in Trinita dei Monti, but his remains were moved in 1840 to [[San Luigi dei Francesi]].<ref name=\"SonnabendWhiteley\"/>\n\nAt his death, he owned only four of his paintings, but most of his drawings.  Apart from the ''Liber Veritatis'' many of these were in bound volumes, the inventory mentioning 12 bound books and a large \"case\" or folder of loose sheets. Five or six large bound volumes were left to his heirs including a ''Tivoli Book'', ''Campagna Book'', ''Early Sketchbook'', and an \"animal album\", all now broken up and dispersed, though as the sheets were numbered their contents have been largely reconstructed by scholars.<ref>Sonnabend & Whiteley, 59; Kitson, 34\u201335</ref>\n\n==Style and subjects==\n[[File:Claude Lorrain - An Artist Studying from Nature - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''An Artist Studying from Nature'', 1639 ([[Cincinnati Art Museum]])]]\n\n===Influences===\nClaude's choice of both style and subject matter grew out of a tradition of landscape painting in Italy, mostly Rome, led by northern artists trained in the style of [[Northern Mannerism]]. [[Matthijs Bril]] had arrived in Rome from [[Antwerp]] around 1575, and was soon joined by his brother [[Paul Bril|Paul]]. Both specialized in landscapes, initially as backgrounds in large [[fresco]]s, a route apparently also taken by Lorrain some decades later. Matthijz died at 33 but Paul remained active in Rome until after Claude's arrival there, although any meeting between them has not been recorded. [[Hans Rottenhammer]] and [[Adam Elsheimer]] were other northern landscapists associated with Bril, who had left Rome long before.\n\nThese artists introduced the genre of small [[cabinet picture]]s, often on copper, where the figures were dominated by their landscape surroundings, which were very often dense woodland placed not far behind figures in the foreground.  Paul Bril had begun to paint larger pictures where the size and balance between the elements, and the type of landscape used, is closer to Claude's work in the future, with an extensive open view behind much of the width of the picture.\n\nAlong with other seventeenth-century artists working in Rome, Claude was also influenced by the new interest in the genre of landscape that emerged in the mid-to-late sixteenth century within the Veneto; starting with the Venetian born painter [[Domenico Campagnola]] and the Dutch artist resident in both Padua and Venice, [[Lambert Sustris]]. Interest in landscape first emerged in Rome in the work of their Brescian pupil [[Girolamo Muziano]], who earned the nickname in the city of Il giovane dei paesi (the young man of the landscapes).<ref>Patrizia Tosini, Girolamo Muziano: dalla Maniera alla Natura, 1532\u20131592 (Ugo Bozzi Editore: 2008), pp. 17\u201377. </ref>  Following the integration of this tradition with other Northern sources, Bolognese artists such as [[Domenichino]], who was in Rome from 1602, painted a number of \"Landscape with...\" subjects, drawn from mythology, religion and literature, as well as genre scenes.  These usually have an open vista in one part of the composition, as well as a steep hill in another. Even when the action between the few small figures is violent, the landscape gives an impression of serenity.  The compositions are careful and balanced, and look forward to Claude's.  The ''[[Landscape with the Flight into Egypt (Carracci)|Landscape with the Flight into Egypt]]'' by [[Annibale Carracci]] (c. 1604) is one of the best Italian landscapes of the start of the century,<ref>Wine (2001), 33, 63; Wine (1994), 22\u201324</ref> but perhaps more a forerunner of Poussin than Claude.\n\n===Early works===\n[[File:'Landscape with a Piping Shepherd' by Claude Lorrain, c. 1629-32, Norton Simon Museum.JPG|thumb|''Landscape with a Piping Shepherd'', c. 1629\u20131632]]\n\nClaude's earliest paintings draw from both these groups, being mostly rather smaller than later. [[Agostino Tassi]] may have been a pupil of Paul Bril, and his influence is especially evident in Claude's earliest works, at a larger size, while some small works of about 1631 recall Elsheimer.<ref name=\"auto2\"/> Initially Claude often includes more figures than was typical of his predecessors, despite his figure drawing being generally recognised as \"notoriously feeble\", as [[Roger Fry]] put it.<ref>Fry, 155</ref>\n\nMore often than later, the figures were mere genre [[staffage]]: shepherds, travellers, and sailors, as appropriate for the scene. In the early 1630s the first religious and mythological subjects appear, with a [[Flight into Egypt]] probably of 1631,<ref>Kitson, 13, [[Duke of Rutland]]</ref> and a [[Judgement of Paris]],<ref>Kitson, 14\u201315</ref> both very common subjects in the \"Landscape with..\" genre.  The pair to the latter is a very early harbour scene, already with tall classical buildings, a type of composition Claude was to use for the rest of his career.<ref>Kitson, 15; Sonnabend & Whiteley, Nos. 1 and 2; both [[Duke of Buccleuch]]</ref>\n\n==Figures and other non-landscape elements==\n[[File:Ascanius Shooting the Stag of Sylvia 1682 Claude Lorrain.jpg|thumb|300px|left|''[[Landscape with Ascanius Shooting the Stag of Sylvia]]'' (1682), Claude's last painting]]\n\n===Figures===\nAlthough virtually every painting contains figures, even if only a shepherd, their weakness has always been recognised, not least by Claude himself; according to Baldinucci he joked that he charged for his landscapes, but gave the figures for free. According to Sandrart he had made considerable efforts to improve, but without success; certainly there are numerous studies, typically for groups of figures, among his drawings. It has often been thought that he handed the figures in some works over to others to paint, but it is now generally agreed that there are few such cases.  Baldinucci mentions [[Filippo Lauri]] in this context, but he was only born in 1623, and can only have taken on such work from the 1640s at best.<ref>Wine (1994), 12\u201314; Wine (2001), 124 (and note); Blunt, 275, n. 243</ref> The rider in the small ''Landscape with an Imaginary View of Tivoli'' in the [[Courtauld Gallery]] in London, LV 67 and dated 1642, is one of the last of his figures to wear contemporary dress.  Thereafter all of them wore \"pastoral dress\" or the 17th-century idea of ancient dress.<ref>Kitson, 20</ref>\n\nIn his last years his figures tend to become ever more elongated, a process taken to an extreme in his last painting, ''[[Ascanius Shooting the Stag of Sylvia]]'', of which even its owner, the [[Ashmolean Museum]], says \"The hunters are impossibly elongated \u2013 Ascanius, in particular, is absurdly top-heavy\".<ref>[http://www.ashmolean.org/assets/docs/Exhibitions/AshmoleanPressImagesClaudeLorrain.pdf Ashmolean Press summary] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160417112057/http://www.ashmolean.org/assets/docs/Exhibitions/AshmoleanPressImagesClaudeLorrain.pdf |date=17 April 2016 }} for ''Claude Lorrain: The Enchanted Landscape'' in 2011</ref> Its pendant ''View of Carthage with Dido and Aeneas'' (1676, [[Kunsthalle, Hamburg]]) has figures almost as extreme.  With the mid-20th fashion for medical diagnosis through art, it was suggested that Claude had developed an optical condition accounting for such effects, but this has been rejected by doctors and critics alike.\n\n===Architecture===\nClaude only rarely painted topographical scenes showing the Renaissance and Baroque Roman architecture still being created in his lifetime, but often borrowed from it to work up imaginary buildings. Most of the buildings near the foreground of his paintings are grand imagined temples and palaces in a generally classical style, but without the attempt at archaeological rigour seen in Poussin's equivalents. Elements are borrowed and worked up from real buildings, both ancient and modern, and in the absence of much knowledge of what an ancient palace facade looked like, his palaces are more like the late Renaissance Roman palaces many of his clients lived in.  Buildings that are less clearly seen, such as the towers that often emerge above trees in his backgrounds, are often more like the vernacular and medieval buildings he would have seen around Rome.\n\nOne example of a semi-topographic painting with \"modern\" buildings (there are rather more such drawings)<ref>e.g., to mention just those with identifiable buildings, Kitson, #s 39, 62, 63, 70, 71, 72</ref> is ''A View of Rome'' (1632, NG 1319), which seems to represent the view from the roof of Claude's house, including his parish church and initial burialplace of Santa Trinita del Monte, and other buildings such as the [[Quirinal Palace]].  This view takes up the left-hand side of the painting, but on the right, behind a group of genre figures in modern dress (uniquely for Claude, these represent a scene of prostitution in the Dutch [[Merry Company]] tradition), is a statue of Apollo and a [[Roman temple]] portico, both of which are either wholly imaginary or at least not placed in their actual locations.<ref>Wine (2001), 122; [https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/claude-a-view-in-rome image on NG page]</ref> \n[[File:Claude Lorrain 008.jpg|right|thumb|''[[The Embarkation of the Queen of Sheba]]'' (1648), [[National Gallery]]]]\n\nIn a generic ''Seaport'' in the National Gallery (1644, NG5) a palace facade expanding on the gateway built about 1570 between the [[Farnese Gardens]] and the [[Roman Forum]] is next door to the [[Arch of Titus]], here apparently part of another palace.<ref>Wine (1994), 70</ref> Behind that Claude repeats a palace he had used before, that borrows from several buildings in and around Rome, including the [[Villa Farnesina]] and the [[Palazzo Senatorio]].<ref>Wine (2001), 50\u201352; [[:File:A Seaport by Claude.jpg|Image]]</ref> It is pointless to question how [[Ascanius]] finds in [[Latium]] a large stone temple in a fully developed [[Corinthian order]], that has evidently been crumbling into ruins for several centuries.\n\n===Shipping===\nClaude's lack of interest in avoiding anachronism is perhaps seen most clearly in the ships in his harbour scenes.  Whether the subject, and the dress of the figures, is supposed to be contemporary, mythogical or from Roman or medieval history, the large ships are usually the same up-to-date merchant vessels. Some large rowed galleys are seen, as in ''Landscape with the Arrival of Aeneas before the City of Pallanteum'' (one of the \"Altieri Claudes\", [[Anglesey Abbey]]), where Virgil's text specifies galleys.<ref>Wine (1994), 99</ref> Ships in the background are more likely to attempt to reflect an ancient setting; in the London ''[[Seaport with the Embarkation of the Queen of Sheba]]'' (1648, NG 14) the ship at the centre of the composition is modern, the others less so.<ref>Wine (2001), 86</ref>\n\n==Critical assessment and legacy==\n[[File:Claude Lorrain - View of the Campagna - WGA04990.jpg|thumb|Wash drawing of a ''view of the Campagna'']]\nAs seen in his painting ''The Embarkation of the Queen of Sheba'', Claude was innovative in including the Sun itself as a source of light in his paintings.<ref>Buchholz, E. L., S. Kaeppele, K. Hille, and I. Stotland. ''Art, a world history''. Harry N. Abrams, 232. Print.</ref>\n\nIn Rome, [[Paul Bril|Bril]], [[Girolamo Muziano]] and [[Federico Zuccaro]] and later [[Elsheimer]], [[Annibale Carracci]] and [[Domenichino]] made landscape vistas pre-eminent in some of their drawings and paintings (as well as [[Da Vinci]] in his private drawings [https://web.archive.org/web/20080205001934/http://www.royalcollection.org.uk/eGallery/object.asp?theme=LANDSCAPE&object=912409&row=0] or [[Baldassarre Peruzzi]] in his decorative frescoes of ''[[vedute]]''); but it might be argued that not until Claude's generation, did landscape completely reflect an aesthetic viewpoint which was seen as completely autonomous in its moral purpose within the cultural world of Rome. \n\nIn this matter of the importance of landscape, Claude was prescient. Living in a pre-Romantic era, he did not depict those uninhabited panoramas that were to be esteemed in later centuries, such as with [[Salvatore Rosa]]. He painted a pastoral world of fields and valleys not distant from castles and towns. If the ocean horizon is represented, it is from the setting of a busy port. Perhaps to feed the public need for paintings with noble themes, his pictures include demigods, heroes and saints, even though his abundant drawings and sketchbooks prove that he was more interested in [[scenography]].\n\nClaude Lorrain was described as kind to his pupils and hard-working; keenly observant, but an unlettered man until his death.\n\n[[John Constable]] described Claude as \"the most perfect landscape painter the world ever saw\", and declared that in Claude's landscape \"all is lovely \u2013 all amiable \u2013 all is amenity and repose; the calm sunshine of the heart\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nga.gov.au/Exhibition/CONSTABLE/Detail.cfm?IRN=143208|title=CONSTABLE : impressions of land, sea and sky \u2013 John CONSTABLE  \u2013 Landscape with goatherd and goats, after Claude|first=National Gallery of|last=Australia|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Claude Glass==\nThe [[Claude glass]], named after Lorrain in England although there is no indication he used or knew of it or anything similar, gave a framed and dark-tinted reflection of a real view, that was supposed to help artists produce works of art similar to his, and tourists to adjust views to a Claudian formula. [[William Gilpin (priest)|William Gilpin]], the inventor of the picturesque ideal, advocated the use of a Claude glass saying, \"they give the object of nature a soft, mellow tinge like the colouring of that Master.\"\n\nClaude glasses were widely used by tourists and amateur artists, who quickly became the targets of satire. [[Hugh Sykes Davies]] observed their facing away from the object they wished to paint, commenting, \"It is very typical of their attitude to Nature that such a position should be desirable.\"<ref>James Buzard (2002). \"The Grand Tour and after 1660\u20131840,\" in ''The Cambridge Companion to Travel Writing''. {{ISBN|0-521-78140-X}}</ref>\n\n==Selected works==\n[[File:Claude Lorrain 014.jpg|thumb|''Landscape with Apollo Guarding the Herds of Admetus and Mercury stealing them'' (1645), [[Doria Pamphilj Gallery]]]]\n[[File:Coast scene with a battle on a bridge by Claude Lorrain.jpg|thumb|300px|right|''[[Liber Veritatis]]'' 137, ''Coast scene with a battle on a bridge '', of which two painted versions are known]]\n[[File:The enchanted castle.jpg|thumb|300px|right|''[[Landscape with Psyche Outside the Palace of Cupid]] (The Enchanted Castle)'' (1664), [[National Gallery]]]]\n*''Landscape with Merchants (The Shipwreck)'' (1630) <small>- [[National Gallery of Art]], Washington, D.C.</small>\n* [[The Flight into Egypt (Lorrain)|''The Flight into Egypt'']] (1635)<small> oil on canvas.

During the [[British Raj]], the town of [[Cooch Behar]] was the seat of a [[princely state]] of [[Koch Bihar]], ruled by the Koch dynasty.\n\n==Etymology==\n{{main| Etymology of Cooch Behar}}\nThe name ''Cooch Behar'' is derived from the name of the Koch or ''[[Rajbongshi people|Rajbongshi]]'' tribes indigenous to this region for many centuries.<ref>{{cite book |last= Pal |first= Dr. Nripendra Nath |title= Itikathai Cooch Behar (A brief history of Cooch Behar) |year=2000 |publisher=Anima Prakashani |location=Kolkata | pages = 11\u201312}}</ref> The word ''behar'' is derived from {{lang-sa| \u0935\u093f\u0939\u093e\u0930}} ''[[vihara]]''.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Maharaja-Jagaddipendra-Narayan.jpg|right|thumb|Maharaja Nripendra Narayan]]\n\n===Early period===\n{{See also|Koch dynasty|Kamarupa Kingdom}}\n\nCooch Behar formed part of the [[Kamarupa Kingdom]] of Assam from the 4th to the 12th centuries. In the 12th century, the area became a part of the [[Kamata Kingdom]], first ruled by the [[Khen dynasty]] from their capital at Kamatapur. The Khens were an indigenous tribe, and they ruled till about 1498 [[Common Era|CE]], when they fell to [[Alauddin Hussain Shah]], the independent Pathan Sultan of [[Gaur, West Bengal|Gour]]. The new invaders fought with the local [[Bhuyan chieftains]] and the [[Ahom kingdom|Ahom]] king [[Suhungmung]] and lost control of the region. During this time, the Koch tribe became very powerful and proclaimed itself ''Kamateshwar'' (Lord of Kamata) and established the Koch dynasty.\n\nThe first important Koch ruler was [[Biswa Singha]], who came to power in 1510 or 1530 CE.<ref name=\"web2\">[http://coochbehar.nic.in/HTMfiles/royal_history.html Royal history of Cooch Behar]. Coochbehar.nic.in (1 January 1950). Retrieved on 18 July 2015.</ref> Under his son, [[Nara Narayan]], the Kamata Kingdom reached its zenith.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://coochbehar.gov.in/HTMfiles/royal_history.html |title=Royal History of Cooch Behar |accessdate=22 October 2006}}</ref> Nara Narayan's younger brother, Shukladhwaj ([[Chilarai]]), was a noted military general who undertook expeditions to expand the kingdom. He became governor of its eastern portion.\n\nAfter Chilarai's death, his son [[Raghudev]] became governor of this portion. Since Nara Narayan did not have a son, Raghudev was seen as the heir apparent. However, a late child of Nara Narayan removed Raghudev's claim to the throne. To placate him, Nara Narayan had to anoint Raghudev as a vassal chief of the portion of the kingdom east of the [[Sankosh river]]. This area came to be known as [[Koch Hajo]]. After the death of Nara Narayan in 1584, Raghudev declared independence. The kingdom ruled by the son of Nara Narayan, [[Lakshmi Narayan]], came to be known as Cooch Behar. The division of the Kamata Kingdom into Koch Behar and Koch Hajo was permanent. Koch Behar aligned itself with the [[Mughal Empire]] and finally joined the India as a part of the West Bengal, whereas remnants of the Koch Hajo rulers aligned themselves with the Ahom kingdom and the region became a part of [[Assam]].\n\nAs the early capital of the Koch Kingdom, Cooch Behar's location was not static and became stable only when shifted to Cooch Behar town. Maharaja [[Rup Narayan]], on the advice of an unknown saint, transferred the capital from [[Attharokotha]] to [[Guriahati]] (now called Cooch Behar town) on the banks of the [[Torsa river]] between 1693 and 1714. After this, the capital was always in or near its present location.\n\nIn 1661 CE, Maharaja [[Pran Narayan]] planned to expand his kingdom. However, [[Mir Jumla II|Mir Jumla]], the [[subedar]] of [[Bengal]] under the Mughal emperor [[Aurangazeb]], attacked Cooch Behar and conquered the territory, meeting almost no resistance.<ref>{{cite book |last= Pal |first=Dr. Nripendra Nath |title= Itikathai Cooch Behar (A brief history of Cooch Behar) |year=2000 |publisher=Anima Prakashani |location=Kolkata | page = 68}}</ref>\nThe town of Cooch Behar was subsequently named Alamgirnagar.<ref name=\"bnpedia1\">{{cite book |last=Bhattacharyya |first=PK |year=2012 |chapter=Kamata-Koch Behar |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Kamata-Koch_Behar |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]}}</ref> Maharaja Pran Narayan regained his kingdom within a few days.\n\n===British Raj===\n[[Image:1907-bengal-sikkim3.jpg|left|thumb|1907 Map of Bengal with Sikkim]]\n{{main|Koch Bihar}}\nIn 1772\u20131773, the king of [[Bhutan]] attacked and captured Cooch Behar.

Bengal]], India, as well as the district's namesake town. During the [[British Raj]], the town of [[Cooch Behar]] was the seat of a [[princely state]] of [[Koch Bihar]], ruled by the Koch dynasty.\n\n==Etymology==\n{{main| Etymology of Cooch Behar}}\nThe name ''Cooch Behar'' is derived from the name of the Koch or ''[[Rajbongshi people|Rajbongshi]]'' tribes indigenous to this region for many centuries.<ref>{{cite book |last= Pal |first= Dr. Nripendra Nath |title= Itikathai Cooch Behar (A brief history of Cooch Behar) |year=2000 |publisher=Anima Prakashani |location=Kolkata | pages = 11\u201312}}</ref> The word ''behar'' is derived from {{lang-sa| \u0935\u093f\u0939\u093e\u0930}} ''[[vihara]]''.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Maharaja-Jagaddipendra-Narayan.jpg|right|thumb|Maharaja Nripendra Narayan]]\n\n===Early period===\n{{See also|Koch dynasty|Kamarupa Kingdom}}\n\nCooch Behar formed part of the [[Kamarupa Kingdom]] of Assam from the 4th to the 12th centuries. In the 12th century, the area became a part of the [[Kamata Kingdom]], first ruled by the [[Khen dynasty]] from their capital at Kamatapur. The Khens were an indigenous tribe, and they ruled till about 1498 [[Common Era|CE]], when they fell to [[Alauddin Hussain Shah]], the independent Pathan Sultan of [[Gaur, West Bengal|Gour]]. The new invaders fought with the local [[Bhuyan chieftains]] and the [[Ahom kingdom|Ahom]] king [[Suhungmung]] and lost control of the region. During this time, the Koch tribe became very powerful and proclaimed itself ''Kamateshwar'' (Lord of Kamata) and established the Koch dynasty.\n\nThe first important Koch ruler was [[Biswa Singha]], who came to power in 1510 or 1530 CE.<ref name=\"web2\">[http://coochbehar.nic.in/HTMfiles/royal_history.html Royal history of Cooch Behar].

He became governor of its eastern portion.\n\nAfter Chilarai's death, his son [[Raghudev]] became governor of this portion. Since Nara Narayan did not have a son, Raghudev was seen as the heir apparent. However, a late child of Nara Narayan removed Raghudev's claim to the throne. To placate him, Nara Narayan had to anoint Raghudev as a vassal chief of the portion of the kingdom east of the [[Sankosh river]]. This area came to be known as [[Koch Hajo]]. After the death of Nara Narayan in 1584, Raghudev declared independence. The kingdom ruled by the son of Nara Narayan, [[Lakshmi Narayan]], came to be known as Cooch Behar. The division of the Kamata Kingdom into Koch Behar and Koch Hajo was permanent. Koch Behar aligned itself with the [[Mughal Empire]] and finally joined the India as a part of the West Bengal, whereas remnants of the Koch Hajo rulers aligned themselves with the Ahom kingdom and the region became a part of [[Assam]].\n\nAs the early capital of the Koch Kingdom, Cooch Behar's location was not static and became stable only when shifted to Cooch Behar town. Maharaja [[Rup Narayan]], on the advice of an unknown saint, transferred the capital from [[Attharokotha]] to [[Guriahati]] (now called Cooch Behar town) on the banks of the [[Torsa river]] between 1693 and 1714. After this, the capital was always in or near its present location.\n\nIn 1661 CE, Maharaja [[Pran Narayan]] planned to expand his kingdom. However, [[Mir Jumla II|Mir Jumla]], the [[subedar]] of [[Bengal]] under the Mughal emperor [[Aurangazeb]], attacked Cooch Behar and conquered the territory, meeting almost no resistance.<ref>{{cite book |last= Pal |first=Dr. Nripendra Nath |title= Itikathai Cooch Behar (A brief history of Cooch Behar) |year=2000 |publisher=Anima Prakashani |location=Kolkata | page = 68}}</ref>\nThe town of Cooch Behar was subsequently named Alamgirnagar.<ref name=\"bnpedia1\">{{cite book |last=Bhattacharyya |first=PK |year=2012 |chapter=Kamata-Koch Behar |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Kamata-Koch_Behar |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]}}</ref> Maharaja Pran Narayan regained his kingdom within a few days.\n\n===British Raj===\n[[Image:1907-bengal-sikkim3.jpg|left|thumb|1907 Map of Bengal with Sikkim]]\n{{main|Koch Bihar}}\nIn 1772\u20131773, the king of [[Bhutan]] attacked and captured Cooch Behar.

Along with his brother [[Albert Roux|Albert]], he opened [[Le Gavroche]], later to become the first three [[Michelin star]]red restaurant in Britain, and [[The Waterside Inn]], which was the first restaurant outside France to hold three stars for 25 years.\n\nRoux followed his brother into becoming a [[pastry chef]], and again to England in order to open their first restaurant.

He was decorated during a period of National Service for France during the 1960s.\n\nHe founded the [[Roux Brothers Scholarship]] along with Albert in 1984, and worked as a consultant for companies such as [[British Airways]] and [[Celebrity Cruises]] over the years. After he and his brother split the business in 1986, Roux took the Waterside Inn, which he handed over to his son, [[Alain Roux|Alain]], in 2002. He remained an active [[food writer]] and appeared on television shows such as ''[[Saturday Kitchen]]'', ''[[MasterChef (UK TV series)|MasterChef]]'' and the Roux family-centric series ''The Roux Legacy'', and on the ''[[Woman's Hour]]'' programme on [[BBC Radio 4]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04hz49k|title=Woman's Hour, BBC Radio 4|work=BBC|accessdate=27 September 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nMichel Roux was born on 19 April 1941 in [[Charolles]], [[Sa\u00f4ne-et-Loire]], in a room above his grandfather's [[charcuterie]]<ref>{{Cite news|last=Grimes|first=William|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/14/obituaries/michel-roux-dead.html|title=Michel Roux, 78, Dies; Helped Bring French Cuisine to London|date=14 March 2020|work=The New York Times|access-date=16 April 2020|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> (a delicatessen specializing in meat products). He moved to Paris with his family after the war, where his father Michel set up his own charcuterie, after not taking over the family business in Charolles.

Roux's tasks at the [[p\u00e2tisserie]] included making up to sixty [[galette des rois|galettes des rois]] over the course of three days for [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]]. Albert found Roux further employment as his apprenticeship ended. As Albert was working at the British Embassy in Paris as a [[sous chef]], Roux joined him there as the pastry chef for the Embassy. He moved on from there to become a chef in [[Philippe de Rothschild]]'s service, while Albert moved to England to work there.<ref name=zesouffle/> \n\nBetween 1960 and 1962, Roux served his [[Conscription in France|French National Service]].

CPI-M cadres were also involved in the \"state terror\".

Her father died when she was six weeks old, after which her mother added to the family income by selling real estate. Dilling's brother, Lafayette Harding Kirkpatrick, who was seven years her senior, became wealthy by the age of 23 after developing properties in [[Hawaii]]. Dilling had an [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopalian]] upbringing, and attended a [[Catholic]] girls' school.{{efn-lr|[[Academy of Our Lady (Chicago)]]}} She was highly religious, and was known to send her friends 40-page letters about the Bible. Prone to bouts of depression, she went on vacations in the US, Canada, and Europe with her mother.<ref name=\"Jeansonne, p8\"/>\n\nIn 1912, she enrolled at the [[University of Chicago]], where she studied music and languages, intending to become an orchestral musician. She studied the harp under Walfried Singer, the [[Chicago Symphony]]'s harpist. She left after three years before graduating, lonely and bitterly disillusioned.<ref name=\"Jeansonne, p8\">Jeansonne, 8</ref> In 1918, she married Albert Dilling, an engineer studying law who attended the same Episcopalian church as Elizabeth. The couple were well off financially, thanks to Elizabeth's inherited money and Albert's job as chief engineer for the Chicago Sewerage District. They lived in [[Wilmette]], a Chicago suburb, and had two children, Kirkpatrick in 1920, and Elizabeth Jane in 1925.<ref name=\"Jeansonne, p8\"/><ref>Dye, 8</ref>\n\nThe family traveled abroad at least ten times between 1923 and 1939, experiences that focused Dilling's political outlook and served to convince her of American superiority.<ref name=\"Jeansonne, p9\">Jeansonne, 9</ref> In 1923, they visited Britain, France and Italy. Offended by the lack of gratitude from the British for American intervention in [[World War I|World War&nbsp;I]], Dilling vowed to oppose any future American involvement in European conflict.<ref name=\"Jeansonne, p9\"/><ref name=\"Erickson, 474\u2013475\">Erickson, 474\u2013475</ref>  They spent a month in the Soviet Union in 1931, where local guides, who Dilling claimed were Jews, told her that communism would take over the world and showed her a map of the US in which the cities were renamed after Soviet heroes. She documented her travels in [[home movies]], filming such scenes as bathers swimming nude in a river beneath a [[Moscow]] church. She was appalled by communism's \"atheism, sex degeneracy, broken homes [and] class hatred.\"<ref name=\"Jeansonne, p9\"/><ref name=\"Erickson, 474\u2013475\"/>\n\nDilling visited Germany in 1931 and, when she returned in 1938, noted a \"great improvement of conditions\".<ref name=\"Jeansonne, p9\"/>  She attended [[Nazi Party]] meetings, and the German government paid her expenses.<ref name=\"Jeansonne, p9\"/> She wrote that \"The German people under [[Hitler]] are contented and happy.&nbsp;... don't believe the stories you hear that this man has not done a great good for this country.\"{{efn-lr|Dilling's perception of Hitler shifted after the war. In the June 1954 ''Patriotic Research Bulletin,'' she states: \"Evidence piles up and up that Hitler himself was not only of Jewish ancestry, but had Jewish financing from the very beginning ... At no time did Hitler disturb the great Jewish bankers who own and run German industry.\"<ref>Jeansonne 67</ref>}}<ref name=\"Jeansonne, p9\"/> In 1938, she toured [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]], where she filmed what she described as Jewish immigrants ruining the country.

We were taken behind the scenes by friends working for the Soviet Government and saw deplorable conditions, first hand. We were appalled, not only at the forced labor, the squalid crowded living quarters, the breadline ration card workers\u2019 stores, the mothers pushing wheelbarrows and begging children of the State nurseries besieging us. The open virulent anti-Christ campaign, every-where, was a shock. In public places were the tirades by loud speaker, in Russian, (our friends translated). Atheist cartoons representing Christ as a villain, a drunk, and the object of a cannibalistic orgy ([[Holy Communion]]): as an oppressor of labor; again as trash being dumped from a wheelbarrow by the Soviet [[Five-year plans for the national economy of the Soviet Union|Five-Year-Plan]] \u2013 these lurid cartoons filled the big bulletin boards in the churches our Soviet guides took us to visit.|''The Plot against Christianity'', 1954<ref>Dye, 10</ref>}}\n\nDilling's political activism was spurred by the \"bitter opposition\" she encountered upon her return to Illinois in 1931, \"against my telling the truth about Russia&nbsp;... from suburbanite 'intellectual' friends and from my own Episcopal minister.\"<ref>Erickson 475</ref> She began public speaking as a hobby, following her doctor's advice. Iris McCord, a Chicago radio broadcaster who taught at the [[Moody Bible Institute]], arranged for her to address local church groups. Within a year Dilling was touring the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]], the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]] and occasionally the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]], accompanied by her husband. She showed her home movies of the Soviet Union and made the same speech several times a week to audiences sometimes as large as several hundred, hosted by organizations such as the [[Daughters of the American Revolution]] (DAR) and the [[American Legion]].<ref name=\"Jeansonne, p10\">Jeansonne, 10</ref><ref name=\"Erickson, p478\">Erickson 478</ref>\n\nIn 1932, Dilling co-founded the Paul Reveres, an anti-communist organization with headquarters in Chicago which eventually had 200 local chapters.<ref>Goldstein 113</ref> She left in 1934, after a dispute with the co-founder Col. Edwin Marshall Hadley, and it folded soon after due to lack of interest. With McCord's encouragement, her lectures were published in a local Wilmette newspaper in 1932, and then collected in a pamphlet entitled ''Red Revolution: Do We Want It Here?'' Dilling claimed that the DAR printed and distributed thousands of copies.<ref name=\"Jeansonne, p10\"/><ref name=\"Erickson, p478\"/>\n[[File:The Red Network.jpg|thumb|''The Red Network'', 1934]]\n\nBeginning in early 1933, Dilling spent twelve to eighteen hours a day for eighteen months researching and cataloging suspected subversives. Her sources included the 1920 four-volume report of the [[Lusk Committee|Joint Legislative Committee to Investigate Seditious Activities]], and Representative [[Hamilton Fish III|Hamilton Fish]]'s 1931 report of an anti-communist investigation. The result was ''The Red Network\u2014A Who's Who and Handbook of Radicalism for Patriots,'' hailed with irony in ''[[The New Republic]]'' as a \"handy, compact reference work\". The first half of the 352-page book was a collection of essays, mostly copied from ''Red Revolution''. The second half contained descriptions of more than 1,300 \"Reds\" (including international figures such as [[Albert Einstein]] and [[Chiang Kai-shek]]), and more than 460 organizations described as \"Communist, Radical Pacifist, Anarchist, Socialist, [or] [[I.W.W.]] controlled\".<ref name=\"Jeansonne, p12\">Jeansonne, 12</ref><ref>Erickson, 478</ref>\n{{quote|Far more than the [[Spider-Web chart]] of the 1920s \u2013 a chart composed by a member of the DAR that plotted suspected red-affiliated organisations with progressive individuals \u2013 ''The Red Network'' revealed the power of \"guilt by association,\" a tactic that would be used all too often by future Red baiters with devastating effectiveness.|Christine K. Erickson, ''Journal of American Studies'', 2002<ref>Erickson 488</ref>}}\n\nThe book was reprinted eight times and sold more than 16,000 copies by 1941. Thousands more were given away. It was sold in Chicago book stores and by mail order from Dilling's house. It was distributed by the [[KKK]], the [[Knights of the White Camellia]], the [[German-American Bund]], and the [[Aryan Bookstores]]. Subscribers to [[Gerald Winrod]]'s new journal, ''The Revealer,'' received a copy; [[Christian fundamentalism|fundamentalist]] preacher [[William Bell Riley|W. B. Riley]], president of the [[University of Northwestern \u2013 St. Paul|Northwest Bible Training School]], claimed he had given away hundreds of copies; and it was advertised and sold by the Moody Bible Institute. It was endorsed by officials in the DAR and the American Legion. Copies were bought by the [[Pinkerton Detective Agency]], the [[New York Police Department]], the [[Chicago Police Department]], and the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]. A [[Los Angeles]] arms manufacturer bought and distributed 150 copies, and a [[tear gas]] manufacturer bought 1,500 copies, which it distributed to the [[Standard Oil Company]], the [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]], and hundreds of police departments.<ref name=\"Jeansonne, p12\"/><ref>Erickson, 480</ref>\n\nIn 1935, Dilling returned to her ''alma mater'' to accuse such people as university president [[Robert Maynard Hutchins]], educational reformer [[John Dewey]], activist [[Jane Addams]], and [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republican]] Senator [[William Borah]] of being communist sympathizers.<ref>Boyer 272\u2013273</ref> Retail tycoon [[Charles R. Walgreen]] asked for her help to obtain a public hearing after his niece complained that professors at the university were communists. They demanded the closure of the university. The [[Illinois Legislature|Illinois legislature]] convened to discuss the matter, ultimately deciding that the claims were unfounded. Dilling delivered a frenetic half-hour speech at the [[Illinois General Assembly]], with calls from the audience to \"kill every communist\".<ref>Jeansonne 11</ref> She declared, \"It is certain that the University of Chicago is diseased with Communism and that its contagion is a menace to the community and the Nation.\"<ref>Boyer 273</ref>\n \nDilling's next book, ''The Roosevelt Red Record and Its Background,'' published two weeks before the [[1936 United States presidential election|1936 presidential election]], was less successful. Like much of her later writing, it was largely a disjointed series of quotations. President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s \"Jew Deal\" (as many{{who|date=September 2017}} including Dilling were calling the New Deal) was already a central theme of ''The Red Network,'' and it was already being debated elsewhere. Dilling later claimed that the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] was founded largely thanks to her two books. She wrote a pamphlet attacking Borah, entitled ''Borah: \"Borer from Within\" the G.O.P.'', fearing that if he won the presidential nomination voters would be forced to choose between two communists. She distributed 5,000 copies at the [[1936 Republican National Convention|Republican National Convention]], and claimed credit for his defeat.{{efn-lr|Historian Glen Jeansonne notes: \"Of all the ultraright women leaders, Dilling was the most critical of [[Eleanor Roosevelt]]. In ''The Roosevelt Red Record and Its Background'' (Chicago: self-published, 1936), Dilling devoted more space to criticizing Eleanor Roosevelt than she devoted to denouncing Franklin Roosevelt. Among her charges were that Eleanor entertained prostitutes, fraternized with Blacks, joined communist organisations, neglected her children, dominated her weak husband, and associated with Jews. Perhaps there was no better litmus test of a woman's political ideology than a woman's opinion of Eleanor Roosevelt.\"<ref>Jeansonne 80</ref>}}<ref name=\"Erickson, pp480-482\">Erickson, 480\u2013482</ref><ref>Jeansonne, 13\u201314, 68</ref><ref name=\"Frederickson 833\">Frederickson 833</ref>\n\nIn 1938, Dilling founded the Patriotic Research Bureau, a vast archive in Chicago with a staff of \"Christian women and girls\" from the Moody Bible Institute. She began regular publication of the ''Patriotic Research Bulletin,'' a newsletter outlining her political and personal views, which she mailed free of charge to her supporters. Editions were often 25 to 30 pages long, with a youthful photograph of the author on the cover conveying a personal touch.<ref name=\"Erickson, pp480-482\"/> The masthead of early issues reads: \"Patriotic Research Bureau. For the defense of Christianity and Americanism\".<ref>{{cite book |title=Dilling bulletin |work=[[WorldCat]] |publisher=[[OCLC]] |oclc = 13771155}}</ref>\n\nDilling was paid $5,000 in 1939 by industrialist [[Henry Ford]] to investigate communism at the [[University of Michigan]].<ref>Jeansonne 12</ref> As well as distributing his antisemitic newspaper ''[[The Dearborn Independent]]'' during the 1920s, Ford was a financial supporter of dozens of antisemitic propagandists.<ref>Jeansonne 16</ref> Dilling discovered hundreds of books at the [[University of Michigan Library|university library]] written by \"radicals\".<ref>Erickson 482</ref> Her 96-page report stated that the university was \"typical of those American colleges which have permitted Marxist-bitten, professional theorists to inoculate wholesome American youths with their collectivist propaganda.\" She reached a similar conclusion when the [[Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce]] paid her to investigate [[UCLA]], and when she investigated her children's universities, [[Cornell University|Cornell]] and [[Northwestern University|Northwestern]].<ref>Goldstein 114</ref>\n\nIn 1940, hoping to influence the [[1940 United States presidential election|presidential election]], Dilling published ''The Octopus,'' setting out her theories of [[Jewish Bolshevism|Jewish Communism]]. The book was published under the pseudonym \"Rev. Frank Woodruff Johnson\". [[Avedis Derounian]] reported Dilling claiming that \"The Jews can never prove that I'm anti-Semitic, I'm too clever for them.\" Her husband feared that allegations of antisemitism would damage his law practice.<ref>Jeansonne, 13\u201314</ref> She admitted that she was the author at her divorce trial in 1942. She explained that she wrote the book as a response to [[B'nai B'rith]]. She stated: \"It airs their dirty lying attempts to shut every Christian mouth and prevent anyone from getting a fair trial in this country\" (for which she was cited for [[contempt of court|contempt]]).<ref>Jeansonne 35</ref>\n\n==Isolationism==\n{{quote|Besides relying on a gendered appeal to patriotic duty, Dilling enjoyed portraying herself as a helpless victim confronted by diabolical evil. One telling example was when a federal subpoena in 1941, issued by the Justice Department, ordered her to Washington DC to explain her alleged affiliations with Nazi sympathizers. She described her experiences at the \"New Deal O.G.P.U.,\" an unsubtle reference to Stalin's secret police, in the format of a play, in which she acted the part of the victim interrogated by an agent of the New Deal. The dramatic scene overflowed with \"sinister glower[s],\" \"sarcastic questions\" and \"long harangue[s].\" The victim, \"a bit weary with the endless hectoring,\" answered unfair questions with righteous indignation. Throughout this little skit, Dilling downplayed her public role and denied the accusation that she was \"an important woman\" and that her \"name carr[ied] weight.\" A sincere act of humility this was not, but it did reveal Dilling's inclination for martyrdom and self-importance, as well as a talent for propaganda.|Erickson, 2002{{efn-lr|Quoting ''Patriotic Research Bulletin'', October 1941<ref name=\"Erickson 484\">Erickson 484</ref>}}<ref name=\"Erickson 484\">Erickson 484</ref>}}\n\nDilling was a central figure in a mass movement of [[isolationist]] women's groups, which opposed US involvement in World War II from a \"[[maternalist]]\" perspective. The membership of these groups in 1941 was between one and six million.<ref>Mcenaney 48</ref><ref>Jeansonne 5, 72</ref><ref name=\"Erickson 485\">Erickson 485</ref> According to historian Kari Frederickson: \"They argued that war was the antithesis of nurturant motherhood, and that as women they had a particular stake in preventing American involvement in the European conflict. ... they intertwined their maternalist arguments with appeals that were right-wing, anti-Roosevelt, anti-British, anti-communist and anti-Semitic.\"<ref name=\"Frederickson 825\u2013826\"/>\n\nThe movement was strongest in the [[Midwest]], a [[conservative]] stronghold with a culture of antisemitism, which had long resented the political dominance of the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]]. Chicago was the base of [[far-right]] activists [[Charles E. Coughlin]], [[Gerald L. K. Smith]] and [[Lyrl Clark Van Hyning]], as well as the [[America First Committee]], which had 850,000 members by 1941. Dilling spoke at America First meetings, and was involved in the founding of Van Hyning's \"We the Mothers Mobilize for America\", a highly active group with 150,000 members who were tasked with infiltrating other organizations. The ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', the newspaper with the highest circulation in the region, was strongly isolationist. It treated Dilling as a trusted expert on anti-communism and continued to support her after she was charged with sedition.{{efn-lr|According to historian Glen Jeansonne: \"Although the committee repudiated the support of fascist sympathizers, its membership included partisans of far-right organizations such as Coughlin's, Smith's, and the mothers' groups. The mothers' movement and the committee recruited members from each other.

R. 1776\". Hundreds of these activists picketed the [[United States Capitol|Capitol]] for two weeks in February 1941. Dilling was arrested when she led a sit-down strike with at least 25 other protesters in the corridor outside the office of 84-year-old Senator [[Carter Glass]]. After a sensational trial lasting six days, she wept as she was found guilty of [[disorderly conduct]] and fined $25.<ref name=\"Erickson 485\"/><ref>Jeansonne 33\u201334</ref> Glass called for the FBI to investigate the women's groups, and stated in ''[[The New York Times]]'' on March 7 that the women had caused \"a noisy disorder of which any self-respecting fishwife would be ashamed. I likewise believe that it would be pertinent to inquire whether they are mothers.

Weinshenk stated that Albert was concerned he could be implicated in such an investigation. In May, an uncontested divorce was agreed. Albert blamed Weinshenk and B'nai B'rith for his allegations and Dilling dropped her libel suit. In June however they decided not to divorce. Albert acted as her lawyer at her sedition trial.

The charges and list of defendants were extended in January 1943. The charges were again extended in January 1944. The judge, [[Edward C.

Her father died when she was six weeks old, after which her mother added to the family income by selling real estate. Dilling's brother, Lafayette Harding Kirkpatrick, who was seven years her senior, became wealthy by the age of 23 after developing properties in [[Hawaii]]. Dilling had an [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopalian]] upbringing, and attended a [[Catholic]] girls' school.{{efn-lr|[[Academy of Our Lady (Chicago)]]}} She was highly religious, and was known to send her friends 40-page letters about the Bible. Prone to bouts of depression, she went on vacations in the US, Canada, and Europe with her mother.<ref name=\"Jeansonne, p8\"/>\n\nIn 1912, she enrolled at the [[University of Chicago]], where she studied music and languages, intending to become an orchestral musician. She studied the harp under Walfried Singer, the [[Chicago Symphony]]'s harpist. She left after three years before graduating, lonely and bitterly disillusioned.<ref name=\"Jeansonne, p8\">Jeansonne, 8</ref> In 1918, she married Albert Dilling, an engineer studying law who attended the same Episcopalian church as Elizabeth.

Iris McCord, a Chicago radio broadcaster who taught at the [[Moody Bible Institute]], arranged for her to address local church groups. Within a year Dilling was touring the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]], the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]] and occasionally the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]], accompanied by her husband. She showed her home movies of the Soviet Union and made the same speech several times a week to audiences sometimes as large as several hundred, hosted by organizations such as the [[Daughters of the American Revolution]] (DAR) and the [[American Legion]].<ref name=\"Jeansonne, p10\">Jeansonne, 10</ref><ref name=\"Erickson, p478\">Erickson 478</ref>\n\nIn 1932, Dilling co-founded the Paul Reveres, an anti-communist organization with headquarters in Chicago which eventually had 200 local chapters.<ref>Goldstein 113</ref> She left in 1934, after a dispute with the co-founder Col. Edwin Marshall Hadley, and it folded soon after due to lack of interest.

Her sources included the 1920 four-volume report of the [[Lusk Committee|Joint Legislative Committee to Investigate Seditious Activities]], and Representative [[Hamilton Fish III|Hamilton Fish]]'s 1931 report of an anti-communist investigation. The result was ''The Red Network\u2014A Who's Who and Handbook of Radicalism for Patriots,'' hailed with irony in ''[[The New Republic]]'' as a \"handy, compact reference work\". The first half of the 352-page book was a collection of essays, mostly copied from ''Red Revolution''. The second half contained descriptions of more than 1,300 \"Reds\" (including international figures such as [[Albert Einstein]] and [[Chiang Kai-shek]]), and more than 460 organizations described as \"Communist, Radical Pacifist, Anarchist, Socialist, [or] [[I.W.W.]] controlled\".<ref name=\"Jeansonne, p12\">Jeansonne, 12</ref><ref>Erickson, 478</ref>\n{{quote|Far more than the [[Spider-Web chart]] of the 1920s \u2013 a chart composed by a member of the DAR that plotted suspected red-affiliated organisations with progressive individuals \u2013 ''The Red Network'' revealed the power of \"guilt by association,\" a tactic that would be used all too often by future Red baiters with devastating effectiveness.|Christine K.

It was sold in Chicago book stores and by mail order from Dilling's house. It was distributed by the [[KKK]], the [[Knights of the White Camellia]], the [[German-American Bund]], and the [[Aryan Bookstores]]. Subscribers to [[Gerald Winrod]]'s new journal, ''The Revealer,'' received a copy; [[Christian fundamentalism|fundamentalist]] preacher [[William Bell Riley|W. B. Riley]], president of the [[University of Northwestern \u2013 St. Paul|Northwest Bible Training School]], claimed he had given away hundreds of copies; and it was advertised and sold by the Moody Bible Institute. It was endorsed by officials in the DAR and the American Legion. Copies were bought by the [[Pinkerton Detective Agency]], the [[New York Police Department]], the [[Chicago Police Department]], and the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]. A [[Los Angeles]] arms manufacturer bought and distributed 150 copies, and a [[tear gas]] manufacturer bought 1,500 copies, which it distributed to the [[Standard Oil Company]], the [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]], and hundreds of police departments.<ref name=\"Jeansonne, p12\"/><ref>Erickson, 480</ref>\n\nIn 1935, Dilling returned to her ''alma mater'' to accuse such people as university president [[Robert Maynard Hutchins]], educational reformer [[John Dewey]], activist [[Jane Addams]], and [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republican]] Senator [[William Borah]] of being communist sympathizers.<ref>Boyer 272\u2013273</ref> Retail tycoon [[Charles R. Walgreen]] asked for her help to obtain a public hearing after his niece complained that professors at the university were communists. They demanded the closure of the university. The [[Illinois Legislature|Illinois legislature]] convened to discuss the matter, ultimately deciding that the claims were unfounded. Dilling delivered a frenetic half-hour speech at the [[Illinois General Assembly]], with calls from the audience to \"kill every communist\".<ref>Jeansonne 11</ref> She declared, \"It is certain that the University of Chicago is diseased with Communism and that its contagion is a menace to the community and the Nation.\"<ref>Boyer 273</ref>\n \nDilling's next book, ''The Roosevelt Red Record and Its Background,'' published two weeks before the [[1936 United States presidential election|1936 presidential election]], was less successful. Like much of her later writing, it was largely a disjointed series of quotations. President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s \"Jew Deal\" (as many{{who|date=September 2017}} including Dilling were calling the New Deal) was already a central theme of ''The Red Network,'' and it was already being debated elsewhere. Dilling later claimed that the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] was founded largely thanks to her two books. She wrote a pamphlet attacking Borah, entitled ''Borah: \"Borer from Within\" the G.O.P.'', fearing that if he won the presidential nomination voters would be forced to choose between two communists. She distributed 5,000 copies at the [[1936 Republican National Convention|Republican National Convention]], and claimed credit for his defeat.{{efn-lr|Historian Glen Jeansonne notes: \"Of all the ultraright women leaders, Dilling was the most critical of [[Eleanor Roosevelt]]. In ''The Roosevelt Red Record and Its Background'' (Chicago: self-published, 1936), Dilling devoted more space to criticizing Eleanor Roosevelt than she devoted to denouncing Franklin Roosevelt. Among her charges were that Eleanor entertained prostitutes, fraternized with Blacks, joined communist organisations, neglected her children, dominated her weak husband, and associated with Jews. Perhaps there was no better litmus test of a woman's political ideology than a woman's opinion of Eleanor Roosevelt.\"<ref>Jeansonne 80</ref>}}<ref name=\"Erickson, pp480-482\">Erickson, 480\u2013482</ref><ref>Jeansonne, 13\u201314, 68</ref><ref name=\"Frederickson 833\">Frederickson 833</ref>\n\nIn 1938, Dilling founded the Patriotic Research Bureau, a vast archive in Chicago with a staff of \"Christian women and girls\" from the Moody Bible Institute. She began regular publication of the ''Patriotic Research Bulletin,'' a newsletter outlining her political and personal views, which she mailed free of charge to her supporters. Editions were often 25 to 30 pages long, with a youthful photograph of the author on the cover conveying a personal touch.<ref name=\"Erickson, pp480-482\"/> The masthead of early issues reads: \"Patriotic Research Bureau.

The book was published under the pseudonym \"Rev. Frank Woodruff Johnson\". [[Avedis Derounian]] reported Dilling claiming that \"The Jews can never prove that I'm anti-Semitic, I'm too clever for them.\" Her husband feared that allegations of antisemitism would damage his law practice.<ref>Jeansonne, 13\u201314</ref> She admitted that she was the author at her divorce trial in 1942. She explained that she wrote the book as a response to [[B'nai B'rith]].

One telling example was when a federal subpoena in 1941, issued by the Justice Department, ordered her to Washington DC to explain her alleged affiliations with Nazi sympathizers. She described her experiences at the \"New Deal O.G.P.U.,\" an unsubtle reference to Stalin's secret police, in the format of a play, in which she acted the part of the victim interrogated by an agent of the New Deal. The dramatic scene overflowed with \"sinister glower[s],\" \"sarcastic questions\" and \"long harangue[s].\" The victim, \"a bit weary with the endless hectoring,\" answered unfair questions with righteous indignation. Throughout this little skit, Dilling downplayed her public role and denied the accusation that she was \"an important woman\" and that her \"name carr[ied] weight.\" A sincere act of humility this was not, but it did reveal Dilling's inclination for martyrdom and self-importance, as well as a talent for propaganda.|Erickson, 2002{{efn-lr|Quoting ''Patriotic Research Bulletin'', October 1941<ref name=\"Erickson 484\">Erickson 484</ref>}}<ref name=\"Erickson 484\">Erickson 484</ref>}}\n\nDilling was a central figure in a mass movement of [[isolationist]] women's groups, which opposed US involvement in World War II from a \"[[maternalist]]\" perspective.

Chicago was the base of [[far-right]] activists [[Charles E. Coughlin]], [[Gerald L. K. Smith]] and [[Lyrl Clark Van Hyning]], as well as the [[America First Committee]], which had 850,000 members by 1941. Dilling spoke at America First meetings, and was involved in the founding of Van Hyning's \"We the Mothers Mobilize for America\", a highly active group with 150,000 members who were tasked with infiltrating other organizations. The ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', the newspaper with the highest circulation in the region, was strongly isolationist. It treated Dilling as a trusted expert on anti-communism and continued to support her after she was charged with sedition.{{efn-lr|According to historian Glen Jeansonne: \"Although the committee repudiated the support of fascist sympathizers, its membership included partisans of far-right organizations such as Coughlin's, Smith's, and the mothers' groups.

Dilling was arrested when she led a sit-down strike with at least 25 other protesters in the corridor outside the office of 84-year-old Senator [[Carter Glass]].

Weinshenk stated that Albert was concerned he could be implicated in such an investigation. In May, an uncontested divorce was agreed.
