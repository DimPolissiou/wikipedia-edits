Andrew Leahey of ''[[AllMusic]]'' gave a review: Released toward the end of the show\u2019s second season, this soundtrack features nine songs performed by the cast of ''Sonny with a Chance''. Lovato, who plays title character Allison \"Sonny\" Munroe, gets the most air time, singing lead on four songs (including the theme \"So Far, So Great\") and leaving co-stars Tiffany Thornton and Sterling Knight with two tunes apiece. Allstar Weekend, a Disney-affiliated emo band with ties to the show, also contribute a song. Thornton and Knight both deserve kudos for co-writing their own tunes, but that doesn\u2019t overshadow the fact that most of the material here is formulaic pop/rock, stripped of anything unique or different from other Disney albums. The vocals are Auto-Tuned, a move that smooths out the natural quirks in each singer\u2019s voice, and the music is played by a group of session musicians who aren\u2019t even listed in the credits. None of that really matters, of course\u2014the kids who watch ''Sonny with a Chance'' don\u2019t give a hoot about the name of the soundtrack\u2019s bass player\u2014but it doesn\u2019t reflect well on Lovato, who has the most to lose as an aspiring musician when albums like this are released.<ref name=\"allmusic.com\"/>\n\n==Commercial performance==\nThe soundtrack debuted number 163 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard 200|200]], making Lovato's lowest debut and peaking soundtrack there.<ref name=Billboard>[{{BillboardURLbyName|artist=soundtrack|chart=all}} ''Sonny with a Chance'' (soundtrack) Billboard listing]</ref> It has also debuted at number 3 on the US [[Kid Albums]] and at number 8 on the US [[Top Soundtracks]].<ref name=\"Billboard\"/>\n\n==Track listing==\nStandard edition\n{{Track listing\n| extra_column    = Artist\n| title1          = [[Me, Myself and Time]]\n| length1         = 3:47\n| writer1         = [[Antonina Armato]], [[Tim James (music producer)|Tim James]], Devrim Karaoglu\n| extra1          = [[Demi Lovato]]\n| title2          = Hanging\n| length2         = 2:58\n| writer2         = [[The Matrix (production team)|Lauren Christy]], [[The Matrix (production team)|Graham Edwards]], [[The Matrix (production team)|Scott Spock]], Knight\n| extra2          = [[Sterling Knight]]\n| title3          = Kiss Me\n| length3         = 3:34\n| writer3         = Adrian Gurvitz, Thornton\n| extra3          = [[Tiffany Thornton]]\n| title4          = What to Do\n| length4         = 3:03\n| writer4         = Jeannie Lurie, Aris Archontis, Chen Neeman\n| extra4          = Demi Lovato\n| title5          = How We Do This\n| length5         = 2:52\n| writer5         = Christy, Edwards, Spock, Knight\n| extra5          = Sterling Knight\n| title6          = Work of Art\n| length6         = 2:56\n| writer6         = [[Adam Anders]], Nikki Hasman, Pam Sheyne\n| extra6          = Demi Lovato\n| title7          = Come Down with Love\n| length7         = 3:05\n| writer7         = Zachary Porter, Nathan Darmody, Mike Daly\n| extra7          = [[Allstar Weekend]]\n| title8          = Sure Feels Like Love\n| length8         = 3:43\n| writer8         = Marshall Altman, Jeff Cohen, Thornton\n| extra8          = Tiffany Thornton\n| title9          = So Far So Great\n| length9         = 2:14\n| writer9         = Lurie, Archontis, Neeman\n| extra9          = Demi Lovato\n}}\n{{Track listing\n| headline        = Brazilian and Polish edition bonus tracks\n| collapsed       = yes\n| extra_column    = Artist\n| title10         = Meet You Later\n| length10        = 2:59\n| extra10         = Andressa Andreatto\n| title11         = Time to Shine\n| length11        = 2:29\n| extra11         = Agnieszka Mrozi\u0144ska\n}}\n\n==Charts==\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Chart (2011)\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"|Peak<br />position\n|-\n|US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]<ref name=\"Billboard\"/>\n|align=\"center\"|163\n|-\n|US Kid Albums\n|align=\"center\"|3\n|-\n|US Top Soundtracks\n|align=\"center\"|8\n|}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n{{Sonny with a Chance}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sonny with a Chance (Soundtrack)}}\n[[Category:Sonny with a Chance|Soundtrack]]\n[[Category:2010 soundtracks]]\n[[Category:Television soundtracks]]\n[[Category:Walt Disney Records soundtracks]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox album\n| name       = Sonny with a Chance\n| type       = Soundtrack\n| artist     = Various artists\n| cover      = Sonny With a Chance soundtrack.jpg\n| alt        =\n| released   = October 5, 2010\n| recorded   = 2008\u20132010\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = [[Pop music|Pop]], [[pop rock]]\n| length     = 28:22\n| label      = [[Walt Disney Records|Walt Disney]]\n| producer   = Various artists\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n}}\n'''''Sonny with a Chance''''' is the [[soundtrack album]] from the [[Disney Channel Original Series]] [[Sonny with a Chance|of the same name]].

Oklahoma City did not make any major moves in the off-season, other than drafting [[James Harden (basketball)|James Harden]] from [[Arizona State University]] with the third overall pick in the [[2009 NBA draft|NBA Draft]]. The Thunder selected [[Rodrigue Beaubois]] with the 25th pick in the 2009 draft before immediately trading him to the [[Dallas Mavericks]] for the 24th pick, center [[Byron Mullens]] from [[Ohio State University]]. The team then added veteran center [[Etan Thomas]] and guard [[Kevin Ollie]]. The last major change to their roster occurred on December 22, 2009, when the team traded for [[Eric Maynor]] from the [[Utah Jazz]]. Maynor immediately supplanted Ollie as the backup point guard.\n\nFrom the outset the young team looked determined and cohesive. The increasing leadership of [[Kevin Durant]], along with the growing experience of the Thunder's younger players, including future [[NBA Most Valuable Player Award|MVP]]s [[Russell Westbrook]] and [[James Harden]], were signs of the Thunder's improvement. The 2009\u201310 season included several victories over the NBA's elite teams, including a 28-point blowout over the [[Eastern Conference (NBA)|Eastern Conference]] champion [[Orlando Magic]] and a 16-point blowout of the reigning NBA champion [[Los Angeles Lakers]]. Road victories over the [[San Antonio Spurs]], [[Utah Jazz]], [[Miami Heat]], [[Boston Celtics]] and [[Dallas Mavericks]] further enhanced their reputation. Though they hovered around .500 for the first half of the season, they went on a 9-game winning streak that sent them into serious playoff contention. Kevin Durant became the youngest player in league history to win the scoring title, averaging 30.1 points per game while playing in all 82 games.\n\n{{multiple image\n | width1 = 144\n | image1 = Russell Westbrook.jpg\n | caption1 = [[Russell Westbrook]]\n | image2 = James Harden 2.jpg\n | width2 = 123\n | caption2 = [[James Harden]]\n | width3 = 93\n | image3 = Kevin Durant 2.jpg\n | caption3 = [[Kevin Durant]]\n | image4 = Serge_Ibaka_Feb_2014.jpg\n | width4 = 145\n | caption4 = [[Serge Ibaka]]\n | image5 = Kendrick_Perkins.jpg\n | caption5 = [[Kendrick Perkins]]\n | width5 = 123\n}}\n\nThe Thunder finished 50\u201332, more than doubling their win total from the previous season.

He missed 16 games, during which Oklahoma City went 4\u201312. During the middle of the season Westbrook and Durant both came back, and similarly suffered more injuries.

Westbrook also had to undergo surgery in early March, to repair a fracture in the zygomatic arch bone of his right cheek. Several days later he returned and recorded several triple-doubles on his way to Western Conference Player of the Month honors from February to April. He also won the 2014\u20132015 NBA scoring title.

The Thunder selected [[Rodrigue Beaubois]] with the 25th pick in the 2009 draft before immediately trading him to the [[Dallas Mavericks]] for the 24th pick, center [[Byron Mullens]] from [[Ohio State University]]. The team then added veteran center [[Etan Thomas]] and guard [[Kevin Ollie]]. The last major change to their roster occurred on December 22, 2009, when the team traded for [[Eric Maynor]] from the [[Utah Jazz]]. Maynor immediately supplanted Ollie as the backup point guard.\n\nFrom the outset the young team looked determined and cohesive. The increasing leadership of [[Kevin Durant]], along with the growing experience of the Thunder's younger players, including future [[NBA Most Valuable Player Award|MVP]]s [[Russell Westbrook]] and [[James Harden]], were signs of the Thunder's improvement.

Road victories over the [[San Antonio Spurs]], [[Utah Jazz]], [[Miami Heat]], [[Boston Celtics]] and [[Dallas Mavericks]] further enhanced their reputation. Though they hovered around .500 for the first half of the season, they went on a 9-game winning streak that sent them into serious playoff contention.

They re-signed [[forward (basketball)|forward]] [[Serge Ibaka]] to a four-year, $48 million extension. After failing to sign [[James Harden]] to an extension that was reportedly worth four years and $52 million, the team decided to trade Harden rather than having to pay the luxury tax penalty. On October 27, 2012, the Thunder traded Harden along with [[center (basketball)|center]] [[Cole Aldrich]] and forwards [[Daequan Cook]] and [[Lazar Hayward]] to the [[Houston Rockets]] for [[Kevin Martin (basketball, born 1983)|Kevin Martin]], [[Jeremy Lamb]], first round draft picks from [[Toronto Raptors|Toronto]] and [[Dallas Mavericks|Dallas]], and one second round draft pick. Martin took over Harden's sixth-man role for the season. The Thunder finished with a 60\u201322 regular season, taking both the Northwest division title and top seed of the Western Conference. In the first round of the playoffs, they faced the 8th-seeded Houston Rockets, featuring former team member James Harden. In game two of the series, [[Russell Westbrook]] was struck by Rockets point guard [[Patrick Beverley]], and fell down with an injury and missed the rest of the playoffs after having knee surgery. Without the team's second-leading scorer, the Thunder, who had a 3\u20130 lead, lost the next two games to bring the series to 3\u20132. In game 6, the Thunder defeated the Rockets to advance to the second round, facing a rematch of the 2011 second round, with the Memphis Grizzlies. The Thunder lost the series 4\u20131, losing four straight games after winning Game 1 at home.\n\n====2013\u201314 season====\n{{Main|2013\u201314 Oklahoma City Thunder season}}\n[[File:Steven Adams (32049572304).jpg|thumb|right|The Thunder selected [[Steven Adams]] as the 12th pick in the [[2013 NBA Draft]].]]\nIn the [[2013 NBA draft]], the Thunder selected 12th pick [[Steven Adams]], traded for the 26th pick [[Andr\u00e9 Roberson|Andre Roberson]], and selected 47th pick [[Grant Jerrett]]. [[Kevin Martin (basketball, born 1983)|Kevin Martin]] was not re-signed, and he opted to join the Timberwolves, while the team were only able add free agent [[Ryan Gomes]], and re-sign [[Derek Fisher]], to conclude their off-season movements. The team finished second in the Western conference with a 59\u201323 record. They met the Memphis Grizzlies for the third time in the playoffs, which set a record for most consecutive overtimes in a playoff series, with four. Oklahoma City prevailed in seven games to play the [[Los Angeles Clippers]] in the semi-finals, whom they defeated in six games. Their final playoff opponent, in the Western Conference Finals, was the San Antonio Spurs, with the Spurs winning, 4\u20132.\n\n====2014\u20132016====\n{{Main|2014\u201315 Oklahoma City Thunder season|2015\u201316 Oklahoma City Thunder season}}\nWith the 21st and 29th picks in the 2014 NBA draft, the Thunder selected [[Mitch McGary]] from Michigan and [[Josh Huestis]] from Stanford. \"He brings energy, passion, and great basketball IQ and toughness what we value\" said Presti on drafting McGary.{{Cite quote|date=April 2016}} Oklahoma City also signed [[Semaj Christon]] in the draft.{{Clarify|reason=What does \"signed in the draft\" mean?|date=April 2016}} On July 3, the Thunder signed [[Sebastian Telfair]]. But they lost shooting guard [[Thabo Sefolosha]] as his contract expired and he agreed to a three-year, $12 million contract with the [[Atlanta Hawks]]. Several weeks before the season started, the Thunder suffered a setback as Durant was diagnosed with a [[Jones fracture]] in his right foot and missed the first 17 games of the season. During the opening game against the [[Portland Trail Blazers]], Westbrook scored 38 points, but found himself sidelined due to a small fracture in his right hand. He missed 16 games, during which Oklahoma City went 4\u201312. During the middle of the season Westbrook and Durant both came back, and similarly suffered more injuries. Durant was ruled out of the rest of the season in March, deciding to have foot surgery. Westbrook also had to undergo surgery in early March, to repair a fracture in the zygomatic arch bone of his right cheek. Several days later he returned and recorded several triple-doubles on his way to Western Conference Player of the Month honors from February to April. He also won the 2014\u20132015 NBA scoring title. However, despite the effort, the Thunder missed the playoffs due to a tiebreaker with the [[New Orleans Pelicans]], and Westbrook fell short of the MVP award, finishing fourth in voting. They finished with a 45\u201337 record. On April 22, 2015, [[Scott Brooks]] was fired as the Thunder head coach. [[Billy Donovan]] was hired on April 30, 2015.

On April 2, 2017, Westbrook tied Oscar Robertson's record for most triple-doubles in an NBA season (41); he broke the record on April 9 against the [[Denver Nuggets]], marking his 42nd triple-double of the season. Westbrook, in that game, also hit the game winning buzzer beater from 36 feet, ending the Nuggets' playoffs hopes and securing the Thunder's 3rd seed matchup with the [[Houston Rockets]] in the NBA playoffs. Oklahoma City lost the playoff series in the first round to the Houston Rockets 4\u20131.

The name \"Sturnidae\" comes from the [[Latin]] word for starling, ''sturnus''. Many Asian species, particularly the larger ones, are called [[myna]]s, and many African species are known as [[Lamprotornis|glossy starlings]] because of their [[iridescence|iridescent]] [[Feather|plumage]]. Starlings are native to [[Europe]], [[Asia]] and [[Africa]], as well as northern [[Australia]] and the islands of the tropical [[Pacific]]. Several European and Asian species have been introduced to these areas as well as [[North America]], [[Hawaii]] and [[New Zealand]], where they generally compete for habitats with native birds and are considered to be [[invasive species]]. The starling species familiar to most people in Europe and North America is the [[common starling]], and throughout much of [[Asia]] and the Pacific, the [[common myna]] is indeed common.\n\nStarlings have strong feet, their flight is strong and direct, and they are very [[gregarious]]. Their preferred habitat is fairly open country, and they eat [[insect]]s and [[fruit]]. Several species live around human habitation and are effectively [[omnivore]]s. Many species search for prey such as [[Beetle#Development|grub]]s by \"open-bill probing\", that is, forcefully opening the bill after inserting it into a crevice, thus expanding the hole and exposing the prey; this behaviour is referred to by the German verb ''zirkeln'' (pronounced {{IPA-de|\u02c8ts\u026a\u0281kl\u0329n|}}).<ref>{{cite journal |author1=East R.  |author2=R.

Most species nest in holes and lay blue or white [[bird egg|eggs]].\n\nStarlings have diverse and complex vocalizations and have been known to embed sounds from their surroundings into their own calls, including [[car alarm]]s and human speech patterns. The birds can recognize particular individuals by their calls and are the subject of research into the evolution of [[human language]].<ref>{{ cite web | last=Zimmer | first=Carl | date=2 May 2006 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/02/science/02song.html | title=Starlings' listening skills may shed light on language evolution | work=The New York Times | accessdate=14 January 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Starling (5503763150).jpg|thumb|[[Common starling]] (''Sturnus vulgaris'') has [[iridescent]] [[plumage]]]]\nStarlings are medium-sized [[passerines]].<ref name = \"HBW\">{{cite book|first=Adrian|last=Craig |first2=Chris |last2=Feare|editor1=del Hoyo, Josep |editor2=Elliott, Andrew |editor3=Christie, David |contribution=Family Sturnidae (Starlings)|title=Handbook of the Birds of the World.

The largest starling, going on standard measurements and perhaps weight, is the [[Nias hill myna]] (''Gracula robusta'').

The plumage of the starling is often brightly coloured due to [[iridescence]]; this colour is derived from the structure of the feathers, not from any pigment. Some species of Asian starling have [[Crest (feathers)|crests]] or erectile feathers on the crest. Other ornamentation includes elongated tail feathers and brightly coloured bare areas on the face. These colours can be derived from pigments, or, as in the [[Bali starling]], structural colour, caused by light scattering off parallel collagen fibres. The irises of many species are red and yellow, although those of younger birds are much darker.<ref name = \"HBW\"/>\n\n==Distribution, habitat and movements==\n[[File:Chestnut-tailed Starling I IMG 2508.jpg|thumb|[[Chestnut-tailed starling]] is a partial migrant over much of the east of its range, but its movements are poorly understood]]\nStarlings inhabit a wide range of habitats from the [[Arctic Circle]] to the [[Equator]]. In fact the only habitat they do not typically occupy is the driest sandy deserts. The family is naturally absent from the Americas and from large parts of Australia but is present over the majority of Europe, Africa and Asia. The genus ''[[Aplonis]]'' has also spread widely across the islands of the Pacific reaching [[Polynesia]], [[Melanesia]] and [[Micronesia]]<ref name = \"HBW\"/> (in addition one species in the genus ''[[Mino (bird)|Mino]]'' has reached the [[Solomon Islands]]<ref>{{cite book|last=Doughty|first=Chris |author2=Day, Nicholas |author3=Andrew Plant|title=Birds of the Solomons, Vanuatu & New Caledonia|publisher=Christopher Helm|location=London|year=1999|isbn=978-0-7136-4690-0}}</ref>). It is also a species of this genus that is the only starling found in northern Australia.<ref name = \"HBW\"/>\n\nAsian species are most common in evergreen forests; 39 species found in Asia are predominantly forest birds as opposed to 24 found in more open or human modified environments. In contrast to this, African species are more likely to be found in open woodlands and savannah; 33 species are open area specialists compared to 13 true forest species. The high diversity of species found in Asia and Africa is not matched by Europe, which has one widespread (and very common) species and two more restricted species. The [[European starling]] is both highly widespread and extremely catholic in its habitat, occupying most types of open habitat. Like many other starling species it has also adapted readily to human-modified habitat, including farmland, orchards, plantations and urban areas.<ref name = \"HBW\"/>\n\nSome species of starling are [[bird migration|migratory]], either entirely, like the [[Shelley's starling]], which breeds in [[Ethiopia]] and northern [[Somalia]] and migrates to [[Kenya]], [[Tanzania]] and southern Somalia, or the [[white-shouldered starling]], which is migratory in part of its range but is resident in others.<ref name = \"HBW\"/>\n\nThe [[European starling]] was purposefully introduced to North America in 1890\u20131891 by the [[American Acclimatization Society]], an organization dedicated to introducing European flora and fauna into North America for cultural and economic reasons.  [[Eugene Schieffelin]], chairman at the time, allegedly decided all birds mentioned by [[William Shakespeare]] should be in North America (the bird had been mentioned in [[Henry IV, Part 1]]). A hundred of them were released from New York's [[Central Park]].<ref name=\"Mirsky\">{{cite journal |url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=call-of-the-reviled|date=May 23, 2008 |journal=Scientific American |title=Shakespeare to blame for introduction of European starlings to U.S |first1=Steve |last1=Mirsky |accessdate=November 14, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Behaviour==\n[[File:Spectacular Starlings at Newport Wetlands Nature Reserve, Cymru, Wales.webm|thumb|[[Swarm behaviour|Murmuration]] of common starlings at [[Newport Wetlands Nature Reserve]], [[Wales]]]]\nThe starlings are generally a highly social family. Most species associate in flocks of varying sizes throughout the year. A [[murmuration]] describes both the [[flocking (behavior)|flocking]] of starlings, as well as their consequentially large flight formations. These flocks may include other species of starlings and sometimes species from other families. This sociality is particularly evident in their roosting behaviour; in the non-breeding season some roosts can number in the thousands of birds.<ref name = \"HBW\"/>\n\n===Mimic ===\nStarlings imitate a variety of avian species and have a repertoire of about 15\u201320 distinct imitations. They also imitate a few sounds other than those of wild birds. The calls of abundant species or calls that are simple in frequency structure and show little amplitude modulation are preferentially imitated. There are local dialects of mimicked sounds.<ref name = \"HBW\"/>\n\n===Diet and feeding===\n[[File:Aplonis opaca.jpg|thumb|[[Micronesian starling]]s have been observed feeding on the eggs of [[seabird]]s]]\nThe diets of the starlings are usually dominated by fruits and insects. Many species are important dispersers of seeds in continents Asia and Africa, for example [[Santalum album|white sandalwood]], [[Ficus benghalensis|Indian Banyan]]. In addition to trees they are also important dispersers of [[parasite|parasitic]] [[mistletoe]]s.

In addition, [[biogeography]] virtually rules out a close relationship of Philippine creepers and treecreepers, as neither the latter nor their close relatives seem have ever reached the [[Wallacea]], let alone the [[Philippines]]. Nonetheless, their inclusion in the Sturnidae is not entirely final and eventually they may remain a separate family.\n\nGenus sequence follows traditional treatments. This is apparently not entirely correct, with ''Scissirostrum'' closer to ''Aplonis'' than to ''Gracula'' for example, and ''[[Acridotheres]]'' among the most advanced genera.

The name \"Sturnidae\" comes from the [[Latin]] word for starling, ''sturnus''. Many Asian species, particularly the larger ones, are called [[myna]]s, and many African species are known as [[Lamprotornis|glossy starlings]] because of their [[iridescence|iridescent]] [[Feather|plumage]]. Starlings are native to [[Europe]], [[Asia]] and [[Africa]], as well as northern [[Australia]] and the islands of the tropical [[Pacific]]. Several European and Asian species have been introduced to these areas as well as [[North America]], [[Hawaii]] and [[New Zealand]], where they generally compete for habitats with native birds and are considered to be [[invasive species]]. The starling species familiar to most people in Europe and North America is the [[common starling]], and throughout much of [[Asia]] and the Pacific, the [[common myna]] is indeed common.\n\nStarlings have strong feet, their flight is strong and direct, and they are very [[gregarious]]. Their preferred habitat is fairly open country, and they eat [[insect]]s and [[fruit]]. Several species live around human habitation and are effectively [[omnivore]]s. Many species search for prey such as [[Beetle#Development|grub]]s by \"open-bill probing\", that is, forcefully opening the bill after inserting it into a crevice, thus expanding the hole and exposing the prey; this behaviour is referred to by the German verb ''zirkeln'' (pronounced {{IPA-de|\u02c8ts\u026a\u0281kl\u0329n|}}).<ref>{{cite journal |author1=East R.  |author2=R.

The plumage of the starling is often brightly coloured due to [[iridescence]]; this colour is derived from the structure of the feathers, not from any pigment. Some species of Asian starling have [[Crest (feathers)|crests]] or erectile feathers on the crest. Other ornamentation includes elongated tail feathers and brightly coloured bare areas on the face. These colours can be derived from pigments, or, as in the [[Bali starling]], structural colour, caused by light scattering off parallel collagen fibres. The irises of many species are red and yellow, although those of younger birds are much darker.<ref name = \"HBW\"/>\n\n==Distribution, habitat and movements==\n[[File:Chestnut-tailed Starling I IMG 2508.jpg|thumb|[[Chestnut-tailed starling]] is a partial migrant over much of the east of its range, but its movements are poorly understood]]\nStarlings inhabit a wide range of habitats from the [[Arctic Circle]] to the [[Equator]]. In fact the only habitat they do not typically occupy is the driest sandy deserts. The family is naturally absent from the Americas and from large parts of Australia but is present over the majority of Europe, Africa and Asia. The genus ''[[Aplonis]]'' has also spread widely across the islands of the Pacific reaching [[Polynesia]], [[Melanesia]] and [[Micronesia]]<ref name = \"HBW\"/> (in addition one species in the genus ''[[Mino (bird)|Mino]]'' has reached the [[Solomon Islands]]<ref>{{cite book|last=Doughty|first=Chris |author2=Day, Nicholas |author3=Andrew Plant|title=Birds of the Solomons, Vanuatu & New Caledonia|publisher=Christopher Helm|location=London|year=1999|isbn=978-0-7136-4690-0}}</ref>). It is also a species of this genus that is the only starling found in northern Australia.<ref name = \"HBW\"/>\n\nAsian species are most common in evergreen forests; 39 species found in Asia are predominantly forest birds as opposed to 24 found in more open or human modified environments. In contrast to this, African species are more likely to be found in open woodlands and savannah; 33 species are open area specialists compared to 13 true forest species. The high diversity of species found in Asia and Africa is not matched by Europe, which has one widespread (and very common) species and two more restricted species. The [[European starling]] is both highly widespread and extremely catholic in its habitat, occupying most types of open habitat. Like many other starling species it has also adapted readily to human-modified habitat, including farmland, orchards, plantations and urban areas.<ref name = \"HBW\"/>\n\nSome species of starling are [[bird migration|migratory]], either entirely, like the [[Shelley's starling]], which breeds in [[Ethiopia]] and northern [[Somalia]] and migrates to [[Kenya]], [[Tanzania]] and southern Somalia, or the [[white-shouldered starling]], which is migratory in part of its range but is resident in others.<ref name = \"HBW\"/>\n\nThe [[European starling]] was purposefully introduced to North America in 1890\u20131891 by the [[American Acclimatization Society]], an organization dedicated to introducing European flora and fauna into North America for cultural and economic reasons.  [[Eugene Schieffelin]], chairman at the time, allegedly decided all birds mentioned by [[William Shakespeare]] should be in North America (the bird had been mentioned in [[Henry IV, Part 1]]).

Most species associate in flocks of varying sizes throughout the year. A [[murmuration]] describes both the [[flocking (behavior)|flocking]] of starlings, as well as their consequentially large flight formations. These flocks may include other species of starlings and sometimes species from other families. This sociality is particularly evident in their roosting behaviour; in the non-breeding season some roosts can number in the thousands of birds.<ref name = \"HBW\"/>\n\n===Mimic ===\nStarlings imitate a variety of avian species and have a repertoire of about 15\u201320 distinct imitations. They also imitate a few sounds other than those of wild birds. The calls of abundant species or calls that are simple in frequency structure and show little amplitude modulation are preferentially imitated. There are local dialects of mimicked sounds.<ref name = \"HBW\"/>\n\n===Diet and feeding===\n[[File:Aplonis opaca.jpg|thumb|[[Micronesian starling]]s have been observed feeding on the eggs of [[seabird]]s]]\nThe diets of the starlings are usually dominated by fruits and insects. Many species are important dispersers of seeds in continents Asia and Africa, for example [[Santalum album|white sandalwood]], [[Ficus benghalensis|Indian Banyan]]. In addition to trees they are also important dispersers of [[parasite|parasitic]] [[mistletoe]]s. In South Africa, the [[red-winged starling]] is an important disperser of the [[introduced species|introduced]] ''[[Acacia cyclops]]''.

The all-inclusive Sturnidae grouping conveys little information about [[biogeography]], and obscures the evolutionary distinctness of the three lineages. Establishing a valid name for the [[clade]] consisting of Sibley/Monroe's \"pan-Sturnidae\" would nonetheless be desirable to contrast them with the other major lineages of Muscicapoidea.\n\nStarlings probably originated in the general area of [[East Asia]], perhaps towards the southwestern [[Pacific]], as evidenced by the number of [[plesiomorph]]ic lineages to occur there. Expansion into Africa appears to have occurred later, as most [[Synapomorphy|derived]] forms are found there.

Given the overall evidence for origin of most [[Passeri]] families in the first half of the [[Miocene]], it appears to be not too far off the mark however.<ref name=zuccon/>\n\nAs of 2007, recent studies<ref name=zuccon/><ref name=cibois/> identified two major [[clade]]s of this family, corresponding to the generally drab, often striped, largish \"atypical [[myna]]s\" and other mainly Asian-Pacific lineages, and the often smaller, sometimes highly [[apomorph]]ic [[taxa]] which are most common in Africa and the Palearctic, usually have metallic coloration, and in a number of species also bright [[carotinoid]] plumage colors on the underside. Inside this latter group, there is a clade consisting of species which, again, are usually not too brightly colored, and which consists of the \"typical\" myna-''[[Sturnus]]'' assemblage.\n\nThe [[Philippine creeper]]s, a single genus of three species of [[treecreeper]]-like birds appear to be highly [[apomorph]]ic members of the more initial radiation of the Sturnidae.<ref name=zuccon/> While this may seem odd at first glance, their placement has always been contentious. In addition, [[biogeography]] virtually rules out a close relationship of Philippine creepers and treecreepers, as neither the latter nor their close relatives seem have ever reached the [[Wallacea]], let alone the [[Philippines]]. Nonetheless, their inclusion in the Sturnidae is not entirely final and eventually they may remain a separate family.\n\nGenus sequence follows traditional treatments. This is apparently not entirely correct, with ''Scissirostrum'' closer to ''Aplonis'' than to ''Gracula'' for example, and ''[[Acridotheres]]'' among the most advanced genera. Too few taxa have yet been studied as regards their relationships however, and thus a change in sequence has to wait on further studies.\n\nAs of 2009, the review by Lovette & Rubenstein (2008) is the most recent work on the phylogeny of the group.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Lovette, I., McCleery, B., Talaba, A., & Rubenstein, D. |year=2008 |title=A complete species-level molecular phylogeny for the \"Eurasian\" starlings (Sturnidae: Sturnus, Acridotheres, and allies): Recent diversification in a highly social and dispersive avian group |journal=Molecular Phylogenetics & Evolution |volume=47 |issue=1 |pages=251\u2013260 |doi=10.1016/j.ympev.2008.01.020 |url=http://www.dustinrubenstein.com/webpage/PUBLICATIONS_files/MPE2008.pdf |pmid=18321732 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205083032/http://www.dustinrubenstein.com/webpage/PUBLICATIONS_files/MPE2008.pdf |archivedate=February 5, 2009 }}</ref>\n\n===Oriental-Australasian clade===\n[[File:Polynesian Starling.jpg|thumb|[[Polynesian starling]], ''Aplonis tabuensis'', ranges from the [[Solomon Islands]] to [[Tonga]]]]\n* '''Genus ''[[Rhabdornis]]'''''\u2014Philippine creepers (three species)\n* '''Genus ''[[Aplonis]]'''''\u2014Pacific starlings (c. 20 living species, 4\u20135 recently [[extinct]])\n* '''Genus ''[[Mino (bird)|Mino]]'''''\n** [[Yellow-faced myna]], ''Mino dumontii''\n** [[Golden myna]], ''Mino anais''\n** [[Long-tailed myna]], ''Mino kreffti''\n* '''Genus ''[[Basilornis]]'''''\n** [[Sulawesi myna]], ''Basilornis celebensis''\n** [[Helmeted myna]], ''Basilornis galeatus''\n** [[Long-crested myna]], ''Basilornis corythaix''\n** [[Apo myna]], ''Basilornis mirandus''\n[[File:Beo.jpg|thumbnail|[[Hill myna]]s, ''[[Gracula]]'' species]]<!-- Check which species this is. -->\n* '''Genus ''[[Sarcops]]'''''\u2014Coleto\n* '''Genus ''[[Streptocitta]]'''''\n** [[White-necked myna]], ''Streptocitta albicollis''\n** [[Bare-eyed myna]], ''Streptocitta albertinae''\n* '''Genus ''[[Enodes]]'''''\u2014fiery-browed myna\n* '''Genus ''[[Scissirostrum]]'''''\u2014finch-billed myna\n* '''Genus ''[[Ampeliceps]]'''''\u2014golden-crested myna\n* '''Genus ''[[Gracula]]'''''\u2014hill mynas (five species)\n* '''Genus ''[[Leucopsar]]'''''\u2014Bali myna\n\n===Afrotropical-Palearctic clade===\n[[File:Lamprotornis nitens, Kruger.jpg|thumbnail|right|[[Cape starling]] (''Lamprotornis nitens'')]]\n* '''Genus ''[[Acridotheres]]'''''\u2014typical mynas (10 species)\n* '''Genus ''[[Spodiopsar]]''''' (2 species)\n* '''Genus ''[[Hylopsar]]''''' (2 species)\n* '''Genus ''[[Agropsar]]''''' (sometimes included in ''Sturnus'' or ''Sturnia'') (2 species)\n* '''Genus ''[[Sturnia]]''''' (sometimes included in ''Sturnus'')\n** [[White-shouldered starling]], ''Sturnia sinensis''\n** [[Chestnut-tailed starling]], ''Sturnia malabarica''\n** [[White-headed starling]], ''Sturnia erythropygia''\n** [[Malabar starling]], ''Sturnia blythii''\n** [[Brahminy starling]], ''Sturnia pagodarum''\n* '''Genus ''[[Sturnus]]'''''\u2014typical starlings (2 species)\n** [[Common starling]], ''Sturnus vulgaris''\n** [[Spotless starling]], ''Sturnus unicolor''\n[[File:CIMG0623.JPG|thumb|African [[superb starling]]]]\n* '''Genus ''[[Rosy starling|Pastor]]'''''\u2014 rosy starling\n* '''Genus ''[[Gracupica]]'''''\u2014 2 species\n* '''Genus ''[[Sturnornis]]'''''\u2014white-faced starling\n* '''Genus ''[[Creatophora]]'''''\u2014wattled starling\n* '''Genus ''[[Notopholia]]''''' -black-bellied starling\n* '''Genus ''[[Lamprotornis]]'''''\u2014typical glossy-starlings (20 species;
