It celebrated its centenary in 2009. Four representative matches had been played in 1908 as players in Auckland attempted to showcase the new code to both Auckland residents and those elsewhere.\n\n==First Meeting==\nA meeting of players was held on Monday 12 July where it was decided to call for another meeting the following Monday and to invite all interested parties to attend. The ultimate aim was to form a league. It was also stated that \"three clubs will be formed, two in the city and one at the North Shore\".<ref>{{cite news \n| title =The Northern Union Game/A Forward Movement\n| page = 4\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume=XLVI| issue=14112\n| date = 14 July 1909\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19090714.2.9.1\n| accessdate = 1 October 2019}}</ref> The meeting was duly held on 19 July at the Chamber of Commerce on Swanson Street. Mr. A.E. Glover, M.P., occupied the chair, and there was a large attendance of around 150 supporters and players. They were to affiliate with the Northern Union and hold a practice match on the following Saturday. \"Mr. R. Eagleton offered the league the use of three suitable playing grounds in Epsom\". The ground was located near Potters Paddock which was later converted into Alexandra Racecourse.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =Past Glories of the Domain/Old-Time Sports Grounds\n| page = 56\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume=XLVI| issue=14112\n| date = 14 July 1930\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19300507.2.199.83\n| accessdate = 12 October 2019}}</ref> Elections for officers were also held with 14 appointments made.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =The Northern Union Game/Auckland Rugby Football League\n| page = 7\n| work=[[Auckland Star]]| volume=LXI| issue=106\n| date = 7 May 1909\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19090720.2.99.1\n| accessdate = 1 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n==North Shore Albions Are Formed==\nA further meeting was held at North Shore on the Wednesday evening at the Council Chambers in Devonport with 40 in attendance, and a club was formed. It was noted that they had the playing numbers for two teams and they had \"taken the pick of the amateur players of the district club\". The club would be called [[North Shore Albions]]. On the Thursday night a preliminary meeting was held in the city with 20 players attending with the goal of forming a club that was either a city team or a combination of a city and [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby]] team, while a [[Newton Rangers|Newton club]] was also aimed to be formed the following week as there was \"considerable dissatisfaction among the members at the management of the Auckland Union\".<ref>{{cite news \n| title =The Northern Union Game/Rapid Developments/Clubs Being Formed\n| page = 8\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume=XLVI| issue=14120\n| date = 23 July 1909\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19090723.2.106.1\n| accessdate = 1 October 2019}}</ref> It was decided to play a match on the Saturday between the [[North Shore Albions|North Shore]] team and the city team. The match was duly played between North Shore and [[City Rovers|City]] and resulted in a win to the former by 44 points to 22.\n\nChairman of the league, D.W. McLean spoke with a representative of ''[[The New Zealand Herald]]'' and was reported as saying the following; \"no payment would be made for playing, but the men when away from home would be recompensed for lost time. They would provide players with uniforms free in order that a team might take the field in a regulation costume, not in varied coloured pants and stockings, as is often seen even in rep. Rugby matches. Their meetings would be open to the press and full information will be given to the public of all moneys received and expended...\". He \"spoke enthusiastically of the possibilities of the new code, from which he contended the rougher elements of rugby had been removed, this providing a game which was full of bright play and sparkling situations. The liability of getting hurt had been greatly reduced by the removal of scrums and line-out play\". It was also reported that several prominent players, questioned about why they had left the Rugby Union game said that \"they were tired of the unequalness of the contests under the present system.

McLean spoke with a representative of ''[[The New Zealand Herald]]'' and was reported as saying the following; \"no payment would be made for playing, but the men when away from home would be recompensed for lost time. They would provide players with uniforms free in order that a team might take the field in a regulation costume, not in varied coloured pants and stockings, as is often seen even in rep. Rugby matches. Their meetings would be open to the press and full information will be given to the public of all moneys received and expended...\". He \"spoke enthusiastically of the possibilities of the new code, from which he contended the rougher elements of rugby had been removed, this providing a game which was full of bright play and sparkling situations. The liability of getting hurt had been greatly reduced by the removal of scrums and line-out play\". It was also reported that several prominent players, questioned about why they had left the Rugby Union game said that \"they were tired of the unequalness of the contests under the present system.

By 1935, CBF and the Jewish Refugees Committee (JRC) were funding a programme that placed Jewish scholars in British universities willing to take on faculty members and graduate students. The two programmes placed more than 200 refugees at universities, including [[Ernst Chain]], whose subsequent work on [[penicillin]] earned him a [[Nobel Prize]].<ref name=\"Men of Vision\" /> In 1936, [[Robert Waley Cohen]] and the other CBF leadership were angered at the placement of [[Youth Aliyah]] emigrants into non-religious environments in Palestine.<ref>Gottlieb, Amy Zahl. ''Men of Vision: Anglo-Jewry's Aid to Victims of the Nazi Regime, 1933-1945''. London: Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 1998,p.130</ref>\n\nCBF coordinated with the [[American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee]] (JDC) in 1936 to create the Council for German Jewry, which carried out much of the pre-war operations to emigrate German Jews.<ref name=\"The Long Horizon\" />  The two organisations aimed to raise \u00a33m that would resettle 66,000 German Jews.<ref>Gottlieb, Amy Zahl.

London: Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 1998,p.68</ref>\n\nResulting from the German-Austrian [[Anschluss]] in 1938, thousands of new refugees in Austria looked to emigrate. Due to the volume of need for refugees, the Council for German Jewry, represented by [[Norman Bentwich]], attended the [[\u00c9vian Conference]] in France to push world leaders for less restrictive immigration policies, but they were largely ignored.<ref name=\"Men of Vision\" />  The advent of [[Kristallnacht]] later in that year exacerbated the refugee crisis, leaving the JDC overwhelmed in both financial and human resource capacity. The Council for German Jewry was eventually able to persuade the UK [[Home Office]] to admit Jews regardless of financial backing, and consequently 68,000 Jews registered before the start of war. For its part, CBF worked with the NGO [[Save the Children]] to establish the Inter-Aid Committee, which helped 471 Jewish and Christian children go to boarding schools in Britain.<ref name=\"Men of Vision\" />\n\n==Kindertransport==\n{{Main|Kindertransport}}\nIn November 1938, Jewish leaders met with British Prime Minister [[Neville Chamberlain]] to advocate for allowing [[German Jewish]] children to immigrate to the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]]. This led the subject of children's immigration to Great Britain to be discussed in the next Cabinet meeting, and the UK changed its policy to allow for admittance of Jewish children with largely no paperwork.<ref name=\"Men of Vision\" />  Having secured government support, CBF started the Kindertransport effort by establishing the Movement for Care of Children from Germany; together with the Baldwin Fund (headed by ex-Prime Minister [[Stanley Baldwin]]) the Movement raised \u00a3545,000 (\u00a328.8 million in 2013 GBP) for Kindertransport. The Movement also identified thousands of Jewish and non-Jewish families from across Britain to host Jewish children during the war years. Additionally, it set up unused summer camps on the south coast of England to house refugees waiting for homes, and coordinated with Dutch organisations to transport children from Germany to the UK. Their efforts were aided by [[Gertruida Wijsmuller-Meijer]], a member of the Netherlands Children's Refugee Committee, who met with eventual [[Final Solution]] administrator [[Adolf Eichmann]] and persuaded him to permit unaccompanied children to go to Britain. By the outbreak of war, the Movement had evacuated 9,354 children from Germany, 90% of them Jewish.<ref name=\"Men of Vision\" />\n\n==Activities during World War II==\nThough evacuation attempts halted with the outbreak of war, CBF continued to support children who had already been evacuated and started new projects. CBF ensured that children were being educated in Jewish contexts, and together with the Movement, they took pains to ensure that every child could get religious education in the religion of her parents. After the war, CBF helped refugees to file claims to recover their families\u2019 property.<ref name=\"Men of Vision\" />  Additionally, CBF and the Council for German Jewry leased a property with two campsites for \u00a3350 a year in 1939, renovating them within six months and opening up a camp for young German men at risk of deportation, the [http://www.kitchenercamp.co.uk/ Kitchener Camp] at Richborough. Over 3,500 men and hundreds of their wives were in residence when war broke out, many of whom would have surely perished in the Holocaust. The camp was disbanded by 1940 as many of the men enlisted, fighting for Britain. The Richborough men ended up in the British company that was [[Dunkirk evacuation|evacuated from Dunkirk]] in 1940.<ref name=\"Men of Vision\" />\n\n==Post war years==\nCBF set up and financed the Jewish Committee for Relief Abroad to help administer aid and support to Jewish survivors of Nazi-occupied areas, which was especially instrumental in the liberation of the [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp]]. In 1947, Movement children were granted British citizenship, and CBF helped file claims to recover refugees\u2019 families\u2019 property. In addition, CBF supported 732 orphaned [https://www.worldjewishrelief.org/about-us/the-boys child Holocaust survivors] in their relocation to Britain after the war, initially to Windermere, and later to 22 hostels around the country.

By 1935, CBF and the Jewish Refugees Committee (JRC) were funding a programme that placed Jewish scholars in British universities willing to take on faculty members and graduate students. The two programmes placed more than 200 refugees at universities, including [[Ernst Chain]], whose subsequent work on [[penicillin]] earned him a [[Nobel Prize]].<ref name=\"Men of Vision\" /> In 1936, [[Robert Waley Cohen]] and the other CBF leadership were angered at the placement of [[Youth Aliyah]] emigrants into non-religious environments in Palestine.<ref>Gottlieb, Amy Zahl.

London: Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 1998,p.130</ref>\n\nCBF coordinated with the [[American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee]] (JDC) in 1936 to create the Council for German Jewry, which carried out much of the pre-war operations to emigrate German Jews.<ref name=\"The Long Horizon\" />  The two organisations aimed to raise \u00a33m that would resettle 66,000 German Jews.<ref>Gottlieb, Amy Zahl.

London: Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 1998,p.68</ref>\n\nResulting from the German-Austrian [[Anschluss]] in 1938, thousands of new refugees in Austria looked to emigrate. Due to the volume of need for refugees, the Council for German Jewry, represented by [[Norman Bentwich]], attended the [[\u00c9vian Conference]] in France to push world leaders for less restrictive immigration policies, but they were largely ignored.<ref name=\"Men of Vision\" />  The advent of [[Kristallnacht]] later in that year exacerbated the refugee crisis, leaving the JDC overwhelmed in both financial and human resource capacity. The Council for German Jewry was eventually able to persuade the UK [[Home Office]] to admit Jews regardless of financial backing, and consequently 68,000 Jews registered before the start of war. For its part, CBF worked with the NGO [[Save the Children]] to establish the Inter-Aid Committee, which helped 471 Jewish and Christian children go to boarding schools in Britain.<ref name=\"Men of Vision\" />\n\n==Kindertransport==\n{{Main|Kindertransport}}\nIn November 1938, Jewish leaders met with British Prime Minister [[Neville Chamberlain]] to advocate for allowing [[German Jewish]] children to immigrate to the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]]. This led the subject of children's immigration to Great Britain to be discussed in the next Cabinet meeting, and the UK changed its policy to allow for admittance of Jewish children with largely no paperwork.<ref name=\"Men of Vision\" />  Having secured government support, CBF started the Kindertransport effort by establishing the Movement for Care of Children from Germany; together with the Baldwin Fund (headed by ex-Prime Minister [[Stanley Baldwin]]) the Movement raised \u00a3545,000 (\u00a328.8 million in 2013 GBP) for Kindertransport. The Movement also identified thousands of Jewish and non-Jewish families from across Britain to host Jewish children during the war years. Additionally, it set up unused summer camps on the south coast of England to house refugees waiting for homes, and coordinated with Dutch organisations to transport children from Germany to the UK. Their efforts were aided by [[Gertruida Wijsmuller-Meijer]], a member of the Netherlands Children's Refugee Committee, who met with eventual [[Final Solution]] administrator [[Adolf Eichmann]] and persuaded him to permit unaccompanied children to go to Britain. By the outbreak of war, the Movement had evacuated 9,354 children from Germany, 90% of them Jewish.<ref name=\"Men of Vision\" />\n\n==Activities during World War II==\nThough evacuation attempts halted with the outbreak of war, CBF continued to support children who had already been evacuated and started new projects. CBF ensured that children were being educated in Jewish contexts, and together with the Movement, they took pains to ensure that every child could get religious education in the religion of her parents. After the war, CBF helped refugees to file claims to recover their families\u2019 property.<ref name=\"Men of Vision\" />  Additionally, CBF and the Council for German Jewry leased a property with two campsites for \u00a3350 a year in 1939, renovating them within six months and opening up a camp for young German men at risk of deportation, the [http://www.kitchenercamp.co.uk/ Kitchener Camp] at Richborough. Over 3,500 men and hundreds of their wives were in residence when war broke out, many of whom would have surely perished in the Holocaust. The camp was disbanded by 1940 as many of the men enlisted, fighting for Britain. The Richborough men ended up in the British company that was [[Dunkirk evacuation|evacuated from Dunkirk]] in 1940.<ref name=\"Men of Vision\" />\n\n==Post war years==\nCBF set up and financed the Jewish Committee for Relief Abroad to help administer aid and support to Jewish survivors of Nazi-occupied areas, which was especially instrumental in the liberation of the [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp]]. In 1947, Movement children were granted British citizenship, and CBF helped file claims to recover refugees\u2019 families\u2019 property. In addition, CBF supported 732 orphaned [https://www.worldjewishrelief.org/about-us/the-boys child Holocaust survivors] in their relocation to Britain after the war, initially to Windermere, and later to 22 hostels around the country.
