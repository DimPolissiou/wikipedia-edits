Their relationship is not very well-documented, but the evidence that they enjoyed each other's company and greatly respected each other's work is strong, and suggests that the elder Haydn acted in at least a minor capacity as a mentor to Mozart. Six string quartets by Mozart are partly dedicated to Haydn (K. 387, 421, 428, 458, 464, 465), the [[Haydn Quartets (Mozart)|\"Haydn\" Quartets]].\n\n==Background==\nHaydn was already a fairly well-known young composer in Mozart's childhood. His six string quartets [[String Quartets, Op. 20 (Haydn)|Opus 20]] (1772), called the \"Sun\" Quartets from the drawing of the sun on the cover of the first edition, were widely circulated and are conjectured (for instance, by [[Charles Rosen]]){{sfn|Rosen|1998|p=264}} to have been the inspiration for the [[Viennese Quartets (Mozart)|six early string quartets K. 168\u2013173]] the 17-year-old Mozart wrote during a 1773 visit to Vienna.{{efn|See {{harvnb|Brown|1992}} for dates and K. numbers.

Haydn's presence was required most of the time at the palace of [[Eszterh\u00e1za]] in Hungary some distance from Vienna, where his employer and patron Prince [[Nikolaus Esterh\u00e1zy]] preferred to live. During the winter months, the Prince moved to the [[Schloss Esterh\u00e1zy|ancestral palace]] of his family in [[Eisenstadt]], bringing Haydn with him. In these periods it was often feasible for Haydn to make brief visits to Vienna, about 40&nbsp;km away.{{efn|For a listing of occasions when Haydn visited Vienna around this time, see {{harvnb|Larsen|1980|pp=53\u201355}}}}\n\n==Meeting==\nAs [[David Wyn Jones|Jones]] notes, there were various points in the 1770s and early 1780s when Haydn and Mozart might have met, Haydn visiting Vienna from his normal work venues of Esterh\u00e1za and Eisenstadt, Mozart from [[Salzburg]]. The earliest at which it is ''likely'' they would have met is 22 and 23 December 1783, at a performance sponsored by the Vienna [[Tonk\u00fcnstler-Societ\u00e4t]], a charitable organization for musicians. On the program were works by both Haydn (Jones: \"a symphony and a chorus, both probably from [the oratorio] ''[[Il ritorno di Tobia]]''\") and Mozart (\"a new concert aria, probably 'Misero! o sogno!' [K. 431], and, on the first night, a piano concerto.\"){{sfn|Jones|2009|p=245}}\n\nAt the time of this meeting, Haydn was the most celebrated composer in Europe.

(Many, if not most, now believe that Dittersdorf actually played first violin, given his world-class technique, and Haydn second.)\n\nThe composer [[Maximilian Stadler]] also remembered chamber music performances in which Haydn and Mozart participated: the two of them took the viola parts in performances of Mozart's string quintets, K. [[String Quintet No. 3 (Mozart)|515]], [[String Quintet No. 4 (Mozart)|516]], and [[String Quintet No. 5 (Mozart)|593]].{{sfn|Jones|2006|p=213}}\n\n==Haydn's view of Mozart==\nHaydn freely praised Mozart, without jealousy, to his friends.

In one passage from his biography he says:\n<blockquote>High esteem for true merit, and regard for the individual, influenced his judgment of works of art. He was always very touched when he spoke of the two Haydns or other great masters.{{sfn|Niemetschek|1798|p=68}}</blockquote>\nBy \"Haydns\", Niemetschek refers also to Joseph's now quite underrated brother [[Michael Haydn|Michael]], who was both Leopold and W. A. Mozart's friend and colleague during his many years in Salzburg as organist-choirmaster of the cathedral there.\n\nAn often-retold anecdote from Niemetschek is the following:\n<blockquote>At a private party a new work of Joseph Haydn was being performed. Besides Mozart there were a number of other musicians present, among them a certain man who was never known to praise anyone but himself. He was standing next to Mozart and found fault with one thing after another. For a while Mozart listened patiently; when he could bear it no longer and the fault-finder once more conceitedly declared: \"I would not have done that\", Mozart retorted: \"Neither would I, but do you know why?  Because neither of us could have thought of anything so appropriate.{{sfn|Niemetschek|1798|p=69}}</blockquote>\nNiemetschek concludes, \"By this remark he made for himself yet another irreconcilable enemy.\"\n\n==The \"Haydn\" quartets==\nMozart's [[Haydn Quartets (Mozart)|\"Haydn\" quartets]] (K. 387, 421, 428, 458, 464 and 465) were written during the early years of their friendship, and were published in 1785. They are thought to be stylistically influenced by Haydn's [[String Quartets, Op. 33 (Haydn)|Opus 33]] series, which had appeared in 1781. Mozart's dedication of these six quartets to Haydn was rather unusual, at a time when dedicatees were usually aristocrats:\n<blockquote>A father who had decided to send his sons out into the great world thought it his duty to entrust them to the protection and guidance of a man who was very celebrated at the time, and who happened moreover to be his best friend. In the same way I send my six sons to you ... Please, then, receive them kindly and be to them a father, guide, and friend! ... I entreat you, however, to be indulgent to those faults which may have escaped a father's partial eye, and in spite of them, to continue your generous friendship towards one who so highly appreciates it.<ref>Bernard Jacobson (1995) in CD#13 of the ''Best of [[The Complete Mozart Edition]]'' [Germany: Philips].</ref></blockquote>\n\nHaydn in turn was very impressed with Mozart's new work. He heard the new quartets for the first time at a social occasion on 15 January 1785, at which Mozart performed the quartets with \"my dear friend Haydn and other good friends\".{{sfn|Webster|Feder|2001|loc=section 3.4}}{{efn|{{harvnb|Deutsch|1965|p=234}} suggests that on this evening only the first three of the quartets were played.}} At a second occasion, on 12 February, the last three were performed.{{efn|{{harvnb|Deutsch|1965|p=236}} identifies the four players as having probably been the composer, his father [[Leopold Mozart|Leopold]] and two Barons: Anton and Bartholom\u00e4us Tinti, who were Masonic brothers of Mozart.}} Mozart's father [[Leopold Mozart|Leopold]] was present, having come from Salzburg to visit. At that time Haydn made a remark to Leopold that is now widely quoted:\n<blockquote>Before God and as an honest man I tell you that your son is the greatest composer known to me either in person or by name; he has taste, and, furthermore, the most profound knowledge of composition.{{efn|Leopold Mozart's 16 February 1785 letter to his daughter Maria Anna (\"Ich sage Ihnen vor Gott, als ein ehrlicher Mann, ihr Sohn ist der gr\u00f6\u00dfte Componist, den ich von Person und den Nahmen nach kenne: er hat Geschmack, und \u00fcber das die gr\u00f6\u00dfte Compositionswissenschaft.\")}}</blockquote>\n\nMozart would have likely appreciated this testimony, in light of his father's frequently-expressed doubts about his career path.\n\n==Freemasonry==\n{{See also|Mozart and Freemasonry}}\nIt may have been Mozart who was responsible for bringing Haydn into [[Freemasonry]].{{efn|{{harvnb|Thomson|1976|p=28}} writes, \"[T]he close friendship between the two composers makes it almost certain that this was due to Mozart's influence\".}} Mozart joined the lodge called \"Zur Wohlt\u00e4tigkeit\" (\"Beneficence\") on 14 December 1784, and Haydn applied to the lodge \"{{ill|Zur wahren Eintracht|de}}\" (\"True Concord\") on 29 December 1784. Lodge records show that Mozart frequently attended \"Zur wahren Eintracht\" as a visitor.{{sfn|Deutsch|1965|loc=multiple listings.}} Haydn's admission ceremony was held on 11 February 1785; Mozart could not attend due to a concert that night.<ref name=\"Larsen 54\"/>  Although Mozart remained an enthusiastic Mason, Haydn did not; in fact, there is no evidence that he ever attended a meeting after his admittance ceremony,<ref name=\"Larsen 54\"/> and he was dropped from the lodge's rolls in 1787.\n\n==Haydn as Mozart's mentor==\nMozart in many ways did not need a mentor by the time he met Haydn; he was already rather successful and for most of his life up to then had been under the very active tutelage of his father Leopold. However, two aspects of the historical record suggest that Haydn did in some sense take Mozart under his wing and offer him advice.\n\nFirst, during the early Vienna years, when Mozart was influenced by [[Baron van Swieten]] to take up the study of Baroque [[counterpoint]], Haydn lent him his personal copy of the famous counterpoint textbook ''Gradus ad Parnassum'', by [[Johann Joseph Fux]], which was heavily covered with Haydn's personal annotations.{{sfn|White|2006}}\n\nIn addition, like many other younger musicians, Mozart addressed Haydn with the honorific term \"Papa\".{{efn|Haydn noted this to [[Georg August Griesinger]] in 1797; {{harvnb|Deutsch|1965|p=489}}. See also the following section.}} For details of this form of address, see [[Papa Haydn]].\n\n==Form of address==\nThe [[German language]] has two sets of second person pronouns, one (''Sie'', ''Ihnen'', ''Ihr'', etc.) for relatively formal relationships, the other (''du'', ''dich'', ''dir'', etc.) for more intimate relationships (''see [[T\u2013V distinction in the world's languages#Sie and du|T-V distinction]]''). [[Otto Jahn]], in his 1856 Mozart biography, reported that Haydn and Mozart used the informal ''du'' forms in conversation, a practice unusual at the time for two people of such different ages, hence evidence for a close friendship.<ref>{{harvnb|Jahn|1856|p=315}}: \"Auch dutzten sie sich ... \u2013 das war damals bei solchen Altersunterschied ungleich seltner als heutzutage und hatte deshalb auch mehr zu sagen,\" \"They also used 'du' with each other, that was at the time more unusual for such a difference in age than it is nowadays, and thus says more.\"</ref> Jahn relied on the testimony of Mozart's sister-in-law [[Sophie Haibel]] as well as Haydn's friend and biographer [[Georg August Griesinger]].\n\n==Haydn's departure for London==\nHaydn last saw Mozart in the days before he departed for London in December 1790. The oft-retold tale of their last interactions can be found in the biography of [[Albert Christoph Dies]], who interviewed the elderly Haydn 15 years after the event:{{sfn|Dies|1810|pp=119\u2013120}}\n<blockquote>[Haydn's patron] Prince Anton Esterh\u00e1zy granted permission for the journey at once, but it was not right as far as Haydn's friends were concerned ... they reminded him of his age (sixty years),{{efn|Haydn was actually 58 in 1790.}} of the discomforts of a long journey, and of many other things to shake his resolve. But in vain! Mozart especially took pains to say, \"Papa!\" as he usually called him, \"you have had no training for the great world, and you speak too few languages.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" replied Haydn, \"my language is understood all over the world!\"...\n\nWhen Haydn had settled ... his household affairs, he fixed his departure and left on 15 December [1790],{{efn|The original reads 1791, an error.}} in company with [[Johann Peter Salomon|Salomon]]. Mozart on this day never left his friend Haydn. He dined with him, and said at the moment of parting, \"We are probably saying our last farewell in this life.\" Tears welled from the eyes of both. Haydn was deeply moved, for he applied Mozart's words to himself, and the possibility never occurred to him that the thread of Mozart's life could be cut off by the inexorable [[Parcae]] within the following year.</blockquote>\n\n[[Georg August Griesinger|Griesinger]] gives a different (and probably less romanticized) account of the same occasion:{{sfn|Griesinger|1810|pp=22\u201323}}\n<blockquote>Mozart said to Haydn, at a happy meal with Salomon, \"You will not bear it very long and will probably soon come back again, because you are no longer young.\" \"But I am still vigorous and in good health,\" answered Haydn. He was at that time almost 59, and didn't find it necessary to hide his age. But for  Mozart's early death on 5 December 1791, he would have taken Haydn's place in Salomon's concerts in 1794.</blockquote>\n\n==Mozart's death==\nHaydn, still in London a year later when the news of Mozart's death reached him, was distraught; he wrote to their mutual friend [[Michael Puchberg]], \"For some time I was quite beside myself over his death, and could not believe that Providence should so quickly have called away an irreplaceable man into the next world\".{{sfn|Hughes|1970|p=78}}{{efn|For Haydn's friendship with Puchberg see {{harvnb|Webster|Feder|2001|loc=section iii.4}}.}} Haydn wrote to [[Constanze Mozart]] offering musical instruction to her son when he reached the appropriate age, and later followed through on his offer.{{sfn|Hughes|1970|p=78}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist|45em}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n*{{cite journal|last=Brown|first=Peter|year=1992|title=Haydn and Mozart's 1773 Stay in Vienna: Weeding a Musicological Garden|journal=[[The Journal of Musicology]]|pages=192\u2013230|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book|last=Deutsch|first=Otto Erich|authorlink=Otto Erich Deutsch|title=Mozart: A Documentary Biography|url=https://archive.org/details/mozartdocumentar0000deut|url-access=registration|publisher=[[Stanford University]] Press|year=1965|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book|last=Dies|first=Albert Christoph|authorlink=Albert Christoph Dies|year=1810|title=Biographical Accounts of Joseph Haydn|translator=Vernon Gotwals|series=''Haydn: Two Contemporary Portraits''|location=Milwaukee|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book|last1=Geiringer|first1=Karl|author1link=Karl Geiringer|author2=Irene Geiringer|title=Haydn: A Creative Life in Music|publisher=University of California Press|edition=3rd|year=1982|pages=xii, 403|isbn=0-520-04316-2|ref={{harvid|Geiringer|1982}}|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/haydncreativelif00geir_0}}\n*{{cite book|last=Griesinger|first=Georg August|authorlink=Georg August Griesinger|year=1810|title=Biographical Notes Concerning Joseph Haydn|translator=Vernon Gotwals|series=Haydn: Two Contemporary Portraits|location=Milwaukee|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press, Breitkopf und H\u00e4rtel|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book|last=Jahn|first=Otto|authorlink=Otto Jahn|year=1856|title=W.

They are thought to be stylistically influenced by Haydn's [[String Quartets, Op. 33 (Haydn)|Opus 33]] series, which had appeared in 1781. Mozart's dedication of these six quartets to Haydn was rather unusual, at a time when dedicatees were usually aristocrats:\n<blockquote>A father who had decided to send his sons out into the great world thought it his duty to entrust them to the protection and guidance of a man who was very celebrated at the time, and who happened moreover to be his best friend. In the same way I send my six sons to you ... Please, then, receive them kindly and be to them a father, guide, and friend! ... I entreat you, however, to be indulgent to those faults which may have escaped a father's partial eye, and in spite of them, to continue your generous friendship towards one who so highly appreciates it.<ref>Bernard Jacobson (1995) in CD#13 of the ''Best of [[The Complete Mozart Edition]]'' [Germany: Philips].</ref></blockquote>\n\nHaydn in turn was very impressed with Mozart's new work. He heard the new quartets for the first time at a social occasion on 15 January 1785, at which Mozart performed the quartets with \"my dear friend Haydn and other good friends\".{{sfn|Webster|Feder|2001|loc=section 3.4}}{{efn|{{harvnb|Deutsch|1965|p=234}} suggests that on this evening only the first three of the quartets were played.}} At a second occasion, on 12 February, the last three were performed.{{efn|{{harvnb|Deutsch|1965|p=236}} identifies the four players as having probably been the composer, his father [[Leopold Mozart|Leopold]] and two Barons: Anton and Bartholom\u00e4us Tinti, who were Masonic brothers of Mozart.}} Mozart's father [[Leopold Mozart|Leopold]] was present, having come from Salzburg to visit. At that time Haydn made a remark to Leopold that is now widely quoted:\n<blockquote>Before God and as an honest man I tell you that your son is the greatest composer known to me either in person or by name; he has taste, and, furthermore, the most profound knowledge of composition.{{efn|Leopold Mozart's 16 February 1785 letter to his daughter Maria Anna (\"Ich sage Ihnen vor Gott, als ein ehrlicher Mann, ihr Sohn ist der gr\u00f6\u00dfte Componist, den ich von Person und den Nahmen nach kenne: er hat Geschmack, und \u00fcber das die gr\u00f6\u00dfte Compositionswissenschaft.\")}}</blockquote>\n\nMozart would have likely appreciated this testimony, in light of his father's frequently-expressed doubts about his career path.\n\n==Freemasonry==\n{{See also|Mozart and Freemasonry}}\nIt may have been Mozart who was responsible for bringing Haydn into [[Freemasonry]].{{efn|{{harvnb|Thomson|1976|p=28}} writes, \"[T]he close friendship between the two composers makes it almost certain that this was due to Mozart's influence\".}} Mozart joined the lodge called \"Zur Wohlt\u00e4tigkeit\" (\"Beneficence\") on 14 December 1784, and Haydn applied to the lodge \"{{ill|Zur wahren Eintracht|de}}\" (\"True Concord\") on 29 December 1784. Lodge records show that Mozart frequently attended \"Zur wahren Eintracht\" as a visitor.{{sfn|Deutsch|1965|loc=multiple listings.}} Haydn's admission ceremony was held on 11 February 1785; Mozart could not attend due to a concert that night.<ref name=\"Larsen 54\"/>  Although Mozart remained an enthusiastic Mason, Haydn did not; in fact, there is no evidence that he ever attended a meeting after his admittance ceremony,<ref name=\"Larsen 54\"/> and he was dropped from the lodge's rolls in 1787.\n\n==Haydn as Mozart's mentor==\nMozart in many ways did not need a mentor by the time he met Haydn; he was already rather successful and for most of his life up to then had been under the very active tutelage of his father Leopold. However, two aspects of the historical record suggest that Haydn did in some sense take Mozart under his wing and offer him advice.\n\nFirst, during the early Vienna years, when Mozart was influenced by [[Baron van Swieten]] to take up the study of Baroque [[counterpoint]], Haydn lent him his personal copy of the famous counterpoint textbook ''Gradus ad Parnassum'', by [[Johann Joseph Fux]], which was heavily covered with Haydn's personal annotations.{{sfn|White|2006}}\n\nIn addition, like many other younger musicians, Mozart addressed Haydn with the honorific term \"Papa\".{{efn|Haydn noted this to [[Georg August Griesinger]] in 1797; {{harvnb|Deutsch|1965|p=489}}. See also the following section.}} For details of this form of address, see [[Papa Haydn]].\n\n==Form of address==\nThe [[German language]] has two sets of second person pronouns, one (''Sie'', ''Ihnen'', ''Ihr'', etc.) for relatively formal relationships, the other (''du'', ''dich'', ''dir'', etc.) for more intimate relationships (''see [[T\u2013V distinction in the world's languages#Sie and du|T-V distinction]]''). [[Otto Jahn]], in his 1856 Mozart biography, reported that Haydn and Mozart used the informal ''du'' forms in conversation, a practice unusual at the time for two people of such different ages, hence evidence for a close friendship.<ref>{{harvnb|Jahn|1856|p=315}}: \"Auch dutzten sie sich ... \u2013 das war damals bei solchen Altersunterschied ungleich seltner als heutzutage und hatte deshalb auch mehr zu sagen,\" \"They also used 'du' with each other, that was at the time more unusual for such a difference in age than it is nowadays, and thus says more.\"</ref> Jahn relied on the testimony of Mozart's sister-in-law [[Sophie Haibel]] as well as Haydn's friend and biographer [[Georg August Griesinger]].\n\n==Haydn's departure for London==\nHaydn last saw Mozart in the days before he departed for London in December 1790. The oft-retold tale of their last interactions can be found in the biography of [[Albert Christoph Dies]], who interviewed the elderly Haydn 15 years after the event:{{sfn|Dies|1810|pp=119\u2013120}}\n<blockquote>[Haydn's patron] Prince Anton Esterh\u00e1zy granted permission for the journey at once, but it was not right as far as Haydn's friends were concerned ... they reminded him of his age (sixty years),{{efn|Haydn was actually 58 in 1790.}} of the discomforts of a long journey, and of many other things to shake his resolve. But in vain! Mozart especially took pains to say, \"Papa!\" as he usually called him, \"you have had no training for the great world, and you speak too few languages.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" replied Haydn, \"my language is understood all over the world!\"...\n\nWhen Haydn had settled ... his household affairs, he fixed his departure and left on 15 December [1790],{{efn|The original reads 1791, an error.}} in company with [[Johann Peter Salomon|Salomon]]. Mozart on this day never left his friend Haydn. He dined with him, and said at the moment of parting, \"We are probably saying our last farewell in this life.\" Tears welled from the eyes of both. Haydn was deeply moved, for he applied Mozart's words to himself, and the possibility never occurred to him that the thread of Mozart's life could be cut off by the inexorable [[Parcae]] within the following year.</blockquote>\n\n[[Georg August Griesinger|Griesinger]] gives a different (and probably less romanticized) account of the same occasion:{{sfn|Griesinger|1810|pp=22\u201323}}\n<blockquote>Mozart said to Haydn, at a happy meal with Salomon, \"You will not bear it very long and will probably soon come back again, because you are no longer young.\" \"But I am still vigorous and in good health,\" answered Haydn. He was at that time almost 59, and didn't find it necessary to hide his age. But for  Mozart's early death on 5 December 1791, he would have taken Haydn's place in Salomon's concerts in 1794.</blockquote>\n\n==Mozart's death==\nHaydn, still in London a year later when the news of Mozart's death reached him, was distraught; he wrote to their mutual friend [[Michael Puchberg]], \"For some time I was quite beside myself over his death, and could not believe that Providence should so quickly have called away an irreplaceable man into the next world\".{{sfn|Hughes|1970|p=78}}{{efn|For Haydn's friendship with Puchberg see {{harvnb|Webster|Feder|2001|loc=section iii.4}}.}} Haydn wrote to [[Constanze Mozart]] offering musical instruction to her son when he reached the appropriate age, and later followed through on his offer.{{sfn|Hughes|1970|p=78}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist|45em}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n*{{cite journal|last=Brown|first=Peter|year=1992|title=Haydn and Mozart's 1773 Stay in Vienna: Weeding a Musicological Garden|journal=[[The Journal of Musicology]]|pages=192\u2013230|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book|last=Deutsch|first=Otto Erich|authorlink=Otto Erich Deutsch|title=Mozart: A Documentary Biography|url=https://archive.org/details/mozartdocumentar0000deut|url-access=registration|publisher=[[Stanford University]] Press|year=1965|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book|last=Dies|first=Albert Christoph|authorlink=Albert Christoph Dies|year=1810|title=Biographical Accounts of Joseph Haydn|translator=Vernon Gotwals|series=''Haydn: Two Contemporary Portraits''|location=Milwaukee|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book|last1=Geiringer|first1=Karl|author1link=Karl Geiringer|author2=Irene Geiringer|title=Haydn: A Creative Life in Music|publisher=University of California Press|edition=3rd|year=1982|pages=xii, 403|isbn=0-520-04316-2|ref={{harvid|Geiringer|1982}}|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/haydncreativelif00geir_0}}\n*{{cite book|last=Griesinger|first=Georg August|authorlink=Georg August Griesinger|year=1810|title=Biographical Notes Concerning Joseph Haydn|translator=Vernon Gotwals|series=Haydn: Two Contemporary Portraits|location=Milwaukee|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press, Breitkopf und H\u00e4rtel|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book|last=Jahn|first=Otto|authorlink=Otto Jahn|year=1856|title=W.
