At the height of his fame on ''Diff'rent Strokes'', he earned $100,000 per episode.

They are native only to the island of [[Madagascar]]. Most existing lemurs are small, have a pointed snout, large eyes, and a long tail. They chiefly live in trees ([[arboreal]]), and are active at night ([[nocturnal]]).  \n\nLemurs share resemblance with other primates, but evolved independently from [[monkey]]s and [[ape]]s. Due to Madagascar's highly seasonal climate, [[Evolution of lemurs|lemur evolution]] has produced a level of [[species diversity]] rivaling that of any other primate group. Until shortly after humans arrived on the island around 2,000&nbsp;years ago, there were lemurs as large as a male [[gorilla]]. Most species have been discovered or promoted to full species status since the 1990s; however, lemur [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic classification]] is controversial and depends on which [[Species problem|species concept]] is used. \n\nLemurs range in weight from the {{convert|30|g|oz|adj=on}} [[mouse lemur]] to the {{convert|9|kg|lb|adj=on}} [[indri]]. Lemurs share many common basal primate traits, such as divergent [[digit (anatomy)|digits]] on their hands and feet, and [[nail (anatomy)|nails]] instead of [[claw]]s (in most species). However, their [[Brain-to-body mass ratio|brain-to-body size ratio]] is smaller than that of [[Anthropoidea|anthropoid]] primates. As with all [[strepsirrhine]] primates, they have a \"wet nose\" ([[rhinarium]]). Lemurs are generally the most social of the strepsirrhine primates, and communicate more with scents and vocalizations than with visual signals. Lemurs have a relatively low [[basal metabolic rate]], and as a result may exhibit [[dormancy]] such as [[hibernation]] or [[torpor]]. They also have [[seasonal breeder|seasonal breeding]] and [[dominance (ethology)|female social dominance]]. Most eat a wide variety of fruits and leaves, while some are specialists. Two species of lemurs may coexist in the same forest due to different diets. \n\nLemur research during the 18th and 19th centuries focused on taxonomy and specimen collection. Modern studies of lemur ecology and behavior did not begin in earnest until the 1950s and 1960s. Initially hindered by political issues on Madagascar during the mid-1970s, field studies resumed in the 1980s. Lemurs are important for research because their mix of ancestral characteristics and traits shared with anthropoid primates can yield insights on primate and [[human evolution]]. Many lemur species are threatened with extinction due to habitat loss and hunting. Many lemur species have already gone extinct in the last 2000 years due to human activity, and are collectively referred to as the \"[[Subfossil lemur|subfossil lemurs]]\". Although local traditions generally help protect lemurs and their forests, [[Illegal logging in Madagascar|illegal logging]], widespread poverty, and political instability hinder and undermine conservation efforts. Because of these threats and their declining numbers, the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN) considers lemurs to be the world's most endangered mammals, noting that {{as of|2013|lc=y}} up to 90% of all lemur species face extinction within the next 20 to 25&nbsp;years.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name lemur is derived from the [[Latin]]  ''[[lemures]]'',{{Sfn|Garbutt|2007|pp=85\u201386}} which refers to specters or ghosts that were [[exorcism|exorcised]] during the [[Lemuria (festival)|Lemuria festival]] of ancient Rome.<ref name=\"ley196608\">{{Cite magazine\n |last=Ley\n |first=Willy\n |author=\n |last2=\n |first2=\n |last3=\n |first3=\n |date=August 1966\n |title=Scherazade's Island\n |department=For Your Information\n |url=https://archive.org/stream/Galaxy_v24n06_1966-08#page/n45/mode/2up\n |magazine=Galaxy Science Fiction\n |pages=45\u201355\n |type=\n}}</ref>{{R|2008Lux}}\n\n[[Carl Linnaeus]], the founder of modern [[binomial nomenclature]], gave lemurs their name as early as 1758, when he used it in the [[10th edition of Systema Naturae|10th edition of ''Systema Naturae'']]. He included three species under the genus ''Lemur'': ''Lemur tardigradus'' (the [[red slender loris]], now known as ''Loris tardigradus''), ''Lemur catta'' (the [[ring-tailed lemur]]), and ''Lemur volans'' (the [[Philippine flying lemur|Philippine colugo]], now known as ''Cynocephalus volans'').{{Sfn|Linnaeus|1758|pp=29\u201330}}\n\n{{Quote box\n |quote = ''Lemures dixi hos, quod noctu imprimis obambulant, hominibus quodanmodo similes, & lento passu vagantur.''<br />[I call them lemurs, because they go around mainly by night, in a certain way similar to humans, and roam with a slow pace.]\n |source = [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]], ''Museum Adolphi Friderici Regis''{{Sfn|Linnaeus|1754|p=4}}<br />in reference to the [[red slender loris]]{{R|2012Dunkel_et_al}}\n |width = 25%\n |align = right\n}}\nAlthough the term \"lemur\" was first intended for [[slender loris]]es, it was soon limited to the [[endemic]] Malagasy primates, which have been known as \"lemurs\" ever since.{{Sfn|Tattersall|1982|pp=43\u201344}} According to Linnaeus' own explanation, the name was selected because of the nocturnal activity and slow movements of the slender loris.{{R|2012Dunkel_et_al}} Being familiar with the works of [[Virgil]] and [[Ovid]] and seeing an analogy that fit with his naming scheme, Linnaeus adapted the term \"lemur\" for these nocturnal primates.{{Sfn|Blunt|Stearn|2002|p=252}} \n\nIt was noted in 2012 that it has been commonly and falsely assumed that Linnaeus was referring to the ghost-like appearance, [[Tapetum lucidum|reflective eyes]], and ghostly cries of lemurs.{{R|2012Dunkel_et_al}} It has also been speculated that Linnaeus may also have known that some Malagasy people have held legends that lemurs are the souls of their ancestors,{{Sfn|Nield|2007|p=41}} but this is unlikely given that the name was selected for slender lorises from India.{{R|2012Dunkel_et_al}}\n\n==Evolution==\n{{Main|Evolution of lemurs}}\n\nLemurs are primates belonging to the suborder [[Strepsirrhini]]. Like other strepsirrhine [[primate]]s, such as [[loris]]es, [[potto]]s, and [[galago]]s, they share ancestral (or [[Cladistics#plesiomorphy|plesiomorphic]]) traits with early primates. In this regard, lemurs are popularly confused with ancestral primates; however, lemurs did not give rise to monkeys and apes ([[simian]]s). Instead, they evolved independently in isolation on [[Madagascar]].{{R|1997Kay}} All modern strepsirrhines including lemurs are traditionally thought to have evolved from early primates known as [[adapiformes|adapiforms]] during the [[Eocene]] (56 to 34&nbsp;[[Year#Symbols y and yr|mya]]) or [[Paleocene]] (66 to 56&nbsp;mya).{{R|1997Kay}}{{Sfn|Gould|Sauther|2006|pp=vii\u2013xiii}}{{Sfn|Sussman|2003|pp=149\u2013229}} Adapiforms, however, lack a specialized arrangement of teeth, known as a [[toothcomb]], which nearly all living strepsirrhines possess.{{Sfn|Ankel-Simons|2007|pp=392\u2013514}}{{Sfn|Preston-Mafham|1991|pp=141\u2013188}}{{Sfn|Tattersall|2006|pp=3\u201318}} A more recent [[hypothesis]] is that lemurs descended from lorisoids (loris-like) primates.

Based on its anatomy, researchers have found support for classifying the genus ''Daubentonia'' as a specialized [[indriidae|indriid]], a [[Cladistics|sister group]] to all strepsirrhines, and as an indeterminate taxon within the order Primates.{{Sfn|Yoder|2003|pp=1242\u20131247}} Molecular tests have now shown Daubentoniidae is basal to all Lemuriformes,{{Sfn|Yoder|2003|pp=1242\u20131247}}{{R|1996YoderVilgalys}} and in 2008, Russell Mittermeier, Colin Groves, and others ignored addressing higher-level taxonomy by defining lemurs as monophyletic and containing five living families, including Daubentoniidae.{{R|2008MittermeierGroves}}\n\nRelationships among lemur families have also proven to be problematic and have yet to be definitively resolved.{{Sfn|Yoder|2003|pp=1242\u20131247}} To further complicate the issue, several [[Paleogene]] fossil primates from outside Madagascar, such as ''[[Bugtilemur]]'', have been classified as lemurs.{{R|2001Marivaux}} However, scientific consensus does not accept these assignments based on genetic evidence,{{Sfn|Yoder|2003|pp=1242\u20131247}}{{R|1996YoderVilgalys}} and therefore it is generally accepted that the Malagasy primates are monophyletic.{{Sfn|Yoder|2003|pp=1242\u20131247}}{{R|2008Horvath|2008Orlando}} Another area of contention is the relationship between the sportive lemurs and the extinct [[koala lemur]]s (Megaladapidae).

The most noticeable revisions included the gradual split of a broadly defined genus ''Lemur'' into separate genera for the [[ring-tailed lemur]], [[ruffed lemur]]s, and [[True lemur|brown lemurs]] due to a host of morphological differences.{{LoM2 Sfn|pp=209\u2013323}}{{Sfn|Garbutt|2007|pp=137\u2013175}}\n\nDue to several taxonomic revisions by Russell Mittermeier, Colin Groves, and others, the number of recognized lemur species has grown from 33 species and subspecies in 1994 to approximately 100 in 2008.{{R|2007Yoder|2008MittermeierGroves}}{{LoM2 Sfn|pp=85\u201388}} With continuing [[cytogenetics|cytogenetic]] and [[molecular genetics|molecular genetic]] research, as well as ongoing [[field study|field studies]], particularly with [[cryptic species]] such as mouse lemurs, the number of recognized lemur species is likely to keep growing.{{R|2007Yoder}} However, the rapid increase in the number of recognized species has had its critics among taxonomists and lemur researchers. Since classifications ultimately depend on the [[Species#Definitions of species|species concept]] used, [[conservation movement|conservationists]] often favor definitions that result in the splitting of genetically distinct populations into separate species to gain added environmental protection.

Although trends frequently distinguish the smaller, nocturnal lemurs from the larger, diurnal lemurs, there are often exceptions that help exemplify the unique and diverse nature of these Malagasy primates.\n\n===Diet===\n[[File:Microcebus murinus -Artis Zoo, Amsterdam, Netherlands-8c.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A tiny mouse lemur holds a cut piece of fruit in its hands and eats|[[Mouse lemur]]s primarily eat fruit, although their diet also includes insects.]]\nLemur diets are highly variable and demonstrate a high degree of plasticity,{{Sfn|Birkinshaw|Colquhoun|2003|pp=1207\u20131220}} although general trends suggest that the smallest species primarily consume fruit and insects ([[omnivore|omnivory]]), while the larger species are more [[herbivore|herbivorous]], consuming mostly plant material.{{Sfn|Sussman|2003|pp=257\u2013269}} As with all primates, hungry lemurs might eat anything that is edible, whether or not the item is one of their preferred foods.{{Sfn|Ankel-Simons|2007|pp=392\u2013514}} For instance, the ring-tailed lemur eats insects and small [[vertebrate]]s when necessary{{Sfn|Sussman|2003|pp=257\u2013269}}{{LoM2 Sfn|pp=209\u2013323}} and as a result it is commonly viewed as an opportunistic omnivore.{{Sfn|Cuozzo|Yamashita|2006|pp=67\u201396}} [[Coquerel's giant mouse lemur]] (''Mirza coquereli'') is mostly [[frugivore|frugivorous]], but will consume insect secretions during the dry season.{{Sfn|Sussman|2003|pp=257\u2013269}}\n\nA common assumption in [[mammalogy]] is that small mammals cannot subsist entirely on plant material and must have a high-calorie diet in order to survive. As a result, it was thought that the diet of tiny primates must be high in protein-containing insects ([[insectivore|insectivory]]). Research has shown, however, that mouse lemurs, the smallest living primates, consume more fruit than insects, contradicting the popular hypothesis.{{Sfn|Ankel-Simons|2007|pp=392\u2013514}}{{Sfn|Sussman|2003|pp=257\u2013269}}\n\nPlant material makes up the majority of most lemur diets. Members of at least 109 of all known plant families in Madagascar (55%) are exploited by lemurs. Since lemurs are primarily arboreal, most of these exploited species are [[woody plant]]s, including [[tree]]s, [[shrub]]s, or [[liana]]s. Only the ring-tailed lemur, the [[bamboo lemur]]s (genus ''Hapalemur''), and the [[black-and-white ruffed lemur]] (''Varecia variegata'') are known to consume [[herb]]s. While Madagascar is rich in [[fern]] diversity, these plants are rarely eaten by lemurs. One possible reason for this is that ferns lack flowers, fruits, and seeds\u2014common food items in lemur diets. They also occur close to the ground, while lemurs spend most of their time in the trees. Lastly, ferns have an unpleasant taste due to the high content of [[tannin]]s in their [[frond]]s. Likewise, [[mangrove]]s appear to be rarely exploited by lemurs due to their high tannin content.{{Sfn|Birkinshaw|Colquhoun|2003|pp=1207\u20131220}} Some lemurs appear to have evolved responses against common plant defenses, however, such as tannins and alkaloids.{{Sfn|Powzyk|Mowry|2006|pp=353\u2013368}} The [[golden bamboo lemur]] (''Hapalemur aureus''), for instance, eats giant bamboo (''[[Cathariostachys madagascariensis]]''), which contains high levels of [[cyanide]]. This lemur can consume twelve times the typically lethal dose for most mammals on a daily basis; the physiological mechanisms that protect it from cyanide poisoning are unknown.{{Sfn|Sussman|2003|pp=149\u2013229}} At the [[Duke Lemur Center]] (DLC) in the United States, lemurs that roam the outdoor enclosures have been observed eating [[poison ivy]] (''Taxicodendron radicans''), yet have shown no ill effects.{{Sfn|Ankel-Simons|2007|pp=284\u2013391}}\n\n[[File:Prolemur simus Cedric Girard-Buttoz.jpg|thumb|right|upright|alt=A brown-colored lemur clings to a shaft of giant bamboo while eating a fragment in its hands.|Up to 95% of the [[greater bamboo lemur]]'s diet consists of bamboo.{{LoM2 Sfn|pp=209\u2013323}}]]\nMany of the larger lemur species consume leaves ([[folivore|folivory]]),{{Sfn|Birkinshaw|Colquhoun|2003|pp=1207\u20131220}} particularly the indriids.{{Sfn|Garbutt|2007|pp=176\u2013204}} However, some smaller lemurs such as [[sportive lemur]]s (genus ''Lepilemur'') and [[woolly lemur]]s (genus ''Avahi'') also primarily eat leaves, making them the smallest primates that do so.{{Sfn|Thalmann|Ganzhorn|2003|pp=1336\u20131340}} The smallest of the lemurs generally do not eat much leaf matter.{{Sfn|Birkinshaw|Colquhoun|2003|pp=1207\u20131220}} Collectively, lemurs have been documented consuming leaves from at least 82 native plant families and 15 alien plant families. Lemurs tend to be selective in their consumption of the part of the leaf or shoot as well as its age. Often, young leaves are preferred over mature leaves.{{Sfn|Birkinshaw|Colquhoun|2003|pp=1207\u20131220}}\n\nMany lemurs that eat leaves tend to do so during times of fruit scarcity, sometimes suffering weight loss as a result.{{Sfn|Wright|2006|pp=385\u2013402}} Most lemur species, including most of the smallest lemurs and excluding some of the indriids, predominantly eat fruit ([[frugivore|frugivory]]) when available. Collectively, lemurs have been documented consuming fruit from at least 86&nbsp;native plant families and 15&nbsp;alien plant families. As with most tropical fruit eaters, the lemur diet is dominated by fruit from ''[[Ficus]]'' (fig) species.{{Sfn|Birkinshaw|Colquhoun|2003|pp=1207\u20131220}} In many anthropoid primates, fruit is a primary source of [[vitamin C]], but unlike anthropoid primates, lemurs (and all strepsirrhines) can synthesize their own vitamin C.{{R|1969Nakajima}} Historically, captive lemur diets high in vitamin C-rich fruits have been thought to cause [[hemosiderosis]], a type of [[iron overload|iron overload disorder]], since vitamin C increases iron absorption. Although lemurs in captivity have been shown to be prone to hemosiderosis, the frequency of the disease varies across institutions and may depend on the diet, husbandry protocols, and genetic stock. Assumptions about the problem need to be tested separately for each species.{{R|2006Williams}} The ring-tailed lemur, for instance, seems to be less prone to the disorder than other lemur species.{{R|2006Glenn}}\n\nOnly eight species of lemur are known to be [[seed predation|seed predators]] (granivores), but this may be under-reported since most observations only report fruit consumption and do not investigate whether the seeds are consumed as well. These lemurs include some indriids, such as the [[diademed sifaka]] (''Propithecus diadema''), the [[golden-crowned sifaka]] (''Propithecus tattersalli''), the indri,{{Sfn|Sussman|2003|pp=149\u2013229}}{{Sfn|Richard|2003|pp=1345\u20131348}} and the aye-aye. The aye-aye, which specializes in structurally defended resources, can chew through ''[[Canarium]]'' seeds, which are harder than the seeds that [[New World monkey]]s are known to break open.{{Sfn|Sterling|McCreless|2006|pp=159\u2013184}} At least 36&nbsp;genera from 23&nbsp;families of plants are targeted by lemur seed predators.{{Sfn|Birkinshaw|Colquhoun|2003|pp=1207\u20131220}}\n\n[[Inflorescence]]s (clusters of flowers) of at least 60&nbsp;plant families are eaten by lemurs ranging in size from the tiny mouse lemurs to the relatively large ruffed lemurs. If the flowers are not exploited, sometimes the nectar is consumed ([[nectarivore|nectarivory]]) along with the pollen ([[palynivore|palynivory]]). At least 24&nbsp;native species from 17&nbsp;plant families are targeted for nectar or pollen consumption.{{Sfn|Birkinshaw|Colquhoun|2003|pp=1207\u20131220}}\n\nBark and plant exudates such as [[tree sap]] are consumed by a few lemur species. The exploitation of exudates has been reported in 18 plant species and only in the dry regions in the south and west of Madagascar. Only the [[Masoala fork-marked lemur]] (''Phaner furcifer'') and Coquerel's giant mouse lemur regularly consume tree sap. Bark has never been reported as an important food item in lemur diets, but at least four species eat it: the aye-aye, the [[red-tailed sportive lemur]] (''Lepilemur ruficaudatus''), the [[common brown lemur]] (''Eulemur fulvus''), and [[Verreaux's sifaka]] (''Propithecus verreauxi''). Most bark feeding is directly linked to exudate feeding, except for the aye-aye's bark feeding on ''[[Afzelia bijuga]]'' (genus ''[[Afzelia]]'') at [[Nosy Mangabe]] in the northeast.{{Sfn|Birkinshaw|Colquhoun|2003|pp=1207\u20131220}}\n\nSoil consumption ([[geophagy]]) has also been reported and likely helps with [[digestion]], provides minerals and salts, and helps absorb toxins. Sifakas have been observed eating soil from [[termite]] mounds, possibly adding beneficial [[Gut flora|intestinal flora]] to aid the digestion of [[cellulose]] from their folivorous diet.{{Sfn|Ankel-Simons|2007|pp=284\u2013391}}\n\n===Social systems===\n[[File:CHEIROGALEUS-1.JPG|thumb|upright|alt=A small squirrel-like lemur, with a long, slender body and a thick tail, looks over its shoulder from a palm tree.|[[Dwarf lemur]]s are solitary but social, foraging alone but often sleeping in groups.]]\n\nLemurs are social and live in groups that usually include fewer than 15&nbsp;individuals.{{Sfn|Sussman|2003|pp=149\u2013229}} Observed [[social organisation|social organization]] patterns include \"[[solitary but social]]\", \"[[Fission-fusion society|fission-fusion]]\", \"[[pair bond]]s\", and \"[[multi-male group]]\".{{Sfn|Sussman|2003|pp=3\u201337}} Nocturnal lemurs are mostly solitary but social, foraging alone at night but often nesting in groups during the day. The degree of socialization varies by species, gender, location, and season.{{Sfn|Sussman|2003|pp=107\u2013148}}{{Sfn|Sussman|2003|pp=257\u2013269}} In many nocturnal species, for instance, the females, along with their young, will share nests with other females and possibly one male, whose larger [[home range]] happens to overlap one or more female nesting groups. In [[sportive lemur]]s and [[fork-marked lemur]]s, one or two females may share a home range, possibly with a male. In addition to sharing nests, they will also interact vocally or physically with their range-mate while they forage at night.{{Sfn|Sussman|2003|pp=257\u2013269}} Diurnal lemurs exhibit many of the social systems seen in monkeys and apes,{{Sfn|Sussman|2003|pp=149\u2013229}}{{Sfn|Sussman|2003|pp=257\u2013269}} living in relatively permanent and cohesive social groups. Multi-male groups are the most common, just as they are in most anthropoid primates. [[True lemur]]s utilize this social system, often living in groups of ten or less. Ruffed lemurs have been shown to live in fission-fusion societies,{{Sfn|Sussman|2003|pp=257\u2013269}} and Indri forms pair bonds.{{Sfn|Sussman|2003|pp=3\u201337}}\n\nSome lemurs exhibit female [[philopatry]], where females stay within their natal range and the males migrate upon reaching maturity, and in other species both sexes will migrate.{{Sfn|Sussman|2003|pp=149\u2013229}} In some cases, female philopatry may help explain the evolution of female-bonded multi-male groups, such as those of the ring-tailed lemur, [[Milne-Edwards' sifaka]] (''Propithecus edwardsi''), and the Verreaux's sifaka. Their ancestors may have been more solitary, with females that lived in mother-daughter pairs (or dyads). Over time, these dyads may have allied themselves with other neighboring mother-daughter dyads in order to defend more distributed resources in a wide home range. If this is true, then multi-male groups in lemurs may differ fundamentally in their internal structure from those in [[catarrhini|catarrhine]] primates (Old World monkeys and apes).{{R|1998Jolly}}\n\n[[File:Lemur catta 002.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Two adult ring-tailed lemurs lick each other's face while a juvenile moves around on its mother's back.|Social grooming serves many functions for social lemurs.]]\n\nThe presence of female [[dominance (ethology)|social dominance]] sets lemurs apart from most other primates and mammals;{{Sfn|Sussman|2003|pp=149\u2013229}}{{Sfn|Sussman|2003|pp=257\u2013269}}{{Sfn|Rowe|1996|p=27}}{{R|2008Dunham}} in most primate societies, males are dominant unless females band together to form coalitions that displace them.{{R|1990Young}} However, many ''Eulemur'' species are exceptions{{Sfn|Sussman|2003|pp=257\u2013269}}{{Sfn|Overdorff|Johnson|2003|pp=1320\u20131324}} and the [[greater bamboo lemur]] (''Prolemur simus'') does not exhibit female dominance.{{Sfn|Tan|2006|pp=369\u2013382}} When females are dominant within a group, the way they maintain dominance varies. Ring-tailed lemur males act submissively with or without signs of female aggression. Male [[crowned lemur]]s (''Eulemur coronatus''), on the other hand, will only act submissively when females act aggressively towards them. Female aggression is often associated with, but not limited to, feeding.{{R|2002Digby}}\n\nThere have been many hypotheses that have attempted to explain why lemurs exhibit female social dominance while other primates with similar social structures do not,{{Sfn|Sussman|2003|pp=149\u2013229}}{{R|2008Dunham}} but no consensus has been reached after decades of research. The dominant view in the literature states that female dominance is an advantageous trait given the high costs of reproduction and the scarcity of resources available.{{R|2008Dunham}} Indeed, female dominance has been shown to be linked to increased maternal investment.{{R|1990Young}} However, when reproductive costs and extreme seasonality of resources were compared across primates, other primates demonstrated male dominance under conditions that were similar to or more challenging than those faced by lemurs. In 2008, a new hypothesis revised this model using simple [[game theory]]. It was argued that when two individuals were equally matched in fighting capacity, the one with the most need would win the conflict since it would have the most to lose. Consequently, the female, with higher resource needs for pregnancy, lactation, and maternal care, was more likely to win in resource conflicts with equally sized males. This, however, assumed monomorphism between sexes.{{R|2008Dunham}} The following year, a new hypothesis was proposed to explain monomorphism, stating that because most female lemurs are only sexually receptive for a day or two each year, males can utilize a more passive form of mate guarding: [[Mating plug|copulatory plugs]], which block the female reproductive tract, preventing other males from successfully mating with her, and thus reducing the need for aggression and the evolutionary drive for sexual dimorphism.{{R|2009Dunham}}\n\nIn general, levels of [[agonistic behaviour|agonism]] (or aggression) tend to correlate with relative canine height. The ring-tailed lemur has long, sharp upper canine teeth in both sexes, and it also exhibits high levels of agonism. The Indri, on the other hand, has smaller canines and exhibits lower levels of aggression.{{Sfn|Godfrey|Jungers|Schwartz|2006|pp=41\u201364}} When neighboring groups of the same species defend their territories, the conflict can take the form of ritualized defense. In sifakas, these ritualized combats involve staring, growling, scent-marking, and leaping to occupy certain sections of the tree. The indri defends its home range with ritualized \"singing\" battles.{{Sfn|Sussman|2003|pp=149\u2013229}}\n\nLike other primates, lemurs groom socially ([[Social grooming|allogroom]]) to ease tensions and solidify relationships. They groom in greeting, when waking up, when settling in for sleep, between mother and infant, in juvenile relations, and for sexual advances.{{R|1966Jolly}} Unlike anthropoid primates, who part the fur with the hands and pick out particles with the fingers or mouth, lemurs groom with their tongue and scraping with their toothcomb.{{Sfn|Sussman|2003|pp=149\u2013229}}{{R|1966Jolly}} Despite the differences in technique, lemurs groom with the same frequency and for the same reasons as anthropoids.{{R|1966Jolly}}\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Activity patterns===\nThe [[Chronobiology|biological rhythm]] can vary from nocturnal in smaller lemurs to diurnal in most larger lemurs.

Some lemurs [[defecation|defecate]] in specific areas, otherwise known as [[latrine behavior]]. Although many animals exhibit this behavior, it is a rare trait among primates. Latrine behavior can represent territorial marking and aid in interspecies signaling.{{Sfn|Ankel-Simons|2007|pp=392\u2013514}}\n\nCompared to other mammals, primates in general are very vocal, and lemurs are no exception.{{Sfn|Ankel-Simons|2007|pp=392\u2013514}} Some lemur species have extensive vocal repertoires, including the ring-tailed lemur and ruffed lemurs.{{Sfn|Jolly|2003|pp=1329\u20131331}}{{Sfn|Vasey|2003|pp=1332\u20131336}} Some of the most common calls among lemurs are predator alarm calls. Lemurs not only respond to alarm calls of their own species, but also alarm calls of other species and those of non-predatory birds.

Reaching out and touching another individual in this species has been shown to be a submissive behavior, done by younger or submissive animals towards older and more dominant members of the troop. Allogrooming, however, appears to occur more frequently between higher ranking individuals, a shared trait with other primate species.{{R|1985Hosey}} Unlike anthropoid primates, lemur grooming seems to be more intimate and mutual, often directly reciprocated.

The breeding season is also affected by geographical location. For example, mouse lemurs give birth between September and October in their native habitat in the [[Southern Hemisphere]], but from May through June in the captive settings in the [[Northern Hemisphere]].{{Sfn|Ankel-Simons|2007|pp=521\u2013532}}\n\n[[File:Avahi laniger 002.jpg|thumb|right|upright|alt=A baby woolly lemur clings to its mother's back as she clings to a tree.|[[Woolly lemur]]s are nocturnal and typically give birth to one offspring, which they carry with them while foraging.]]\n[[Scent]] factors heavily into lemur reproduction.

When transported, the infants either cling to the mother's fur or are carried in the mouth by the scruff. In some species, such as bamboo lemurs, infants are carried by mouth until they are able to cling to their mother's fur.{{Sfn|Mutschler|Tan|2003|pp=1324\u20131329}} Species that park their offspring include nocturnal species (e.g. mouse lemurs, sportive lemurs, and dwarf lemurs), bamboo lemurs, and ruffed lemurs.{{Sfn|Sussman|2003|pp=107\u2013148}}{{Sfn|Mutschler|Tan|2003|pp=1324\u20131329}} In the case of the ruffed lemurs, the young are [[altricial]] and the mothers build nests for them, much like the smaller, nocturnal lemur species.{{Sfn|Sussman|2003|pp=149\u2013229}} Woolly lemurs are unusual for nocturnal lemurs because they live in cohesive family groups and carry their single offspring with them rather than parking them.{{Sfn|Garbutt|2007|pp=176\u2013204}}{{Sfn|Thalmann|2003|pp=1340\u20131342}} [[Alloparenting]] (multiple or group parenting) has been reported in all lemur families except the sportive lemurs and aye-aye.

This helps them to recover rapidly from a population crash.{{Sfn|Jolly|2003|pp=1329\u20131331}} In captivity, lemurs can live twice as long as they do in the wild, benefiting from consistent nutrition that meets their dietary requirements, medical advancements, and improved understanding of their housing requirements. In 1960, it was thought that lemurs could live between 23 and 25 years. We now know that the larger species can live for more than 30 years without showing signs of aging ([[senescence]]) and still be capable of reproduction.{{Sfn|Ankel-Simons|2007|pp=521\u2013532}}\n\n===Cognitive abilities and tool use===\nLemurs have traditionally been regarded as being less intelligent than anthropoid primates,{{r|1976Ehrlich_et_al}} with [[monkey]]s and apes often described as having more cunning, guile, and deceptiveness.{{Sfn|Preston-Mafham|1991|pp=141\u2013188}} Many lemur species, such as sifakas and the ring-tailed lemur, have scored lower on tests designed for monkeys while performing as well as monkeys on other tests.{{Sfn|Preston-Mafham|1991|pp=141\u2013188}}{{R|1966Jolly}} These comparisons may not be fair since lemurs prefer to manipulate objects with their mouths (rather than their hands) and only take interest in objects when in captivity.{{R|1966Jolly}} Recent studies have shown that lemurs exhibit levels of technical intelligence on par with many other primates, although they manipulate objects less often.{{Sfn|Fichtel|Kappeler|2010|p=413}} [[Tool use by animals|Tool use]] has not been witnessed by lemurs in the wild, although in captivity the common brown lemur and the ring-tailed lemur have been demonstrated to be able to understand and use tools.{{Sfn|Ankel-Simons|2007|pp=392\u2013514}}\n\nA few lemurs have been noted to have relatively large brains. The extinct ''Hadropithecus'' was as large as a large male [[baboon]] and had a comparably sized brain, giving it the largest brain size relative to body size among all prosimians.{{R|ScienceDaily_29Jul08}} The aye-aye also has a large brain-to-body ratio, which may indicate a higher level of intelligence.{{Sfn|Rowe|1996|p=27}} However, despite having a built-in tool in the form of its thin, elongated middle finger, which it uses to fish for insect grubs, the aye-aye has tested poorly in the use of extraneous tools.{{Sfn|Ankel-Simons|2007|pp=392\u2013514}}\n\n==Ecology==\n<!-- Coming soon: {{main|Lemur ecology}} -->\n:''See above: [[#Diet|Diet]], [[#Metabolism|Metabolism]], [[#Activity patterns|Activity patterns]], and [[#Locomotion|Locomotion]]''\n{{Multiple image|direction=vertical|align=right|image1=Cryptoprocta Ferox.JPG|image2=Polyboroides radiatus.jpg|width=200|caption2=The [[Fossa (animal)|fossa]] (above) and the [[Madagascan harrier-hawk]] (below) are predators of many lemur species.{{Sfn|Goodman|2003|pp=1221\u20131228}}|alt1=A cat-like predator with a long, slender body stands on a rock.|alt2=A gray-feathered hawk with red face and a striped underside stands perched on a branch, looking to its right.}}\n\nMadagascar not only contains two radically different [[climate|climatic zones]], the rainforests of the east and the dry regions of the west,{{Sfn|Sussman|2003|pp=149\u2013229}} but also swings from extended drought to [[cyclone]]-generated floods.{{Sfn|Jolly|Sussman|2006|pp=19\u201340}} These climatic and geographical challenges, along with poor soils, low plant productivity, wide ranges of [[ecosystem]] complexity, and a lack of regularly fruiting trees (such as [[Ficus|fig trees]]) have driven the evolution of lemurs' immense morphological and behavioral diversity.{{Sfn|Gould|Sauther|2006|pp=vii\u2013xiii}}{{Sfn|Sussman|2003|pp=149\u2013229}}{{Sfn|Godfrey|Jungers|Schwartz|2006|pp=41\u201364}}{{Sfn|Wright|2006|pp=385\u2013402}} Their survival has required the ability to endure the persistent extremes, not yearly averages.{{Sfn|Jolly|Sussman|2006|pp=19\u201340}}\n\nLemurs have either presently or formerly filled the [[ecological niche]]s normally occupied by monkeys, squirrels, [[woodpecker]]s, and grazing [[ungulate]]s.{{Sfn|Preston-Mafham|1991|pp=141\u2013188}} With the diversity of adaptations for specific ecological niches, habitat selections among lemur families and some genera are often very distinct, thus minimizing [[competition (biology)|competition]].{{Sfn|Sussman|2003|pp=149\u2013229}} In nocturnal lemurs from the more seasonal forests in the west, up to five species can coexist during the wet season due to high food abundance. However, to endure the extreme dry season, three of the five species utilize different dietary patterns and their underlying physiological traits to allow them to coexist: fork-marked lemurs feed on tree gum, sportive lemurs feed on leaves, and giant mouse lemurs sometimes feed on insect secretions. The other two species, the gray mouse lemur and the fat-tailed dwarf lemur (''Cheirogaleus medius''), avoid competition through reduced activity. The gray mouse lemur uses bouts of torpor, while the fat-tailed dwarf lemur hibernates completely.{{Sfn|Sussman|2003|pp=107\u2013148}} Similarly, on the east coast entire genera focus on specific food to avoid too much niche overlap. True lemurs and ruffed lemurs are frugivorous, indriids are folivorous, and bamboo lemurs specialize in bamboo and other grasses. Once again, seasonal dietary differences as well as subtle differences in [[substrate (biology)|substrate]] preferences, [[Tropical rainforest#Layers|forest strata]] used, activity cycle, and social organization enable lemur species to coexist, although this time the species are more closely related and have similar niches.{{Sfn|Sussman|2003|pp=149\u2013229}} A classic example involves [[Niche differentiation|resource partitioning]] between three species of bamboo lemur that live in close proximity in small forested areas: the golden bamboo lemur, the greater bamboo lemur, and the [[eastern lesser bamboo lemur]] (''Hapalemur griseus'').

When lemurs exploit nectar, they may act as pollinators as long as the functional parts of the flower are not damaged.{{Sfn|Birkinshaw|Colquhoun|2003|pp=1207\u20131220}} In fact, several unrelated Malagasy flowering plants demonstrate lemur-specific pollination traits, and studies indicate that some diurnal species, such as the red-bellied lemur and the ruffed lemurs, act as major pollinators.{{Sfn|Sussman|2003|pp=149\u2013229}} Two examples of plant species that rely on lemurs for pollination include traveller's palm (''[[Ravenala madagascariensis]]''){{Sfn|Garbutt|2007|pp=137\u2013175}} and a species of [[legume]]-like liana, ''[[Strongylodon|Strongylodon cravieniae]]''.{{Sfn|Sussman|2003|pp=149\u2013229}} [[Seed dispersal]] is another service lemurs provide.

Around 1703 merchants and sailors began bringing lemurs back to Europe, at which time [[James Petiver]], an apothecary in London, described and illustrated the mongoose lemur. Starting in 1751, the London illustrator [[George Edwards (naturalist)|George Edwards]] began describing and illustrating some lemur species, of which a few were included in various editions of ''[[Systema Naturae]]'' by Carl Linnaeus. In the 1760s and 1770s, French naturalists [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon]] and [[Louis-Jean-Marie Daubenton]] began describing the anatomy of several lemur species. The first traveling naturalist to comment on lemurs was [[Philibert Commer\u00e7on]] in 1771, although it was [[Pierre Sonnerat]] who recorded a greater variety of lemur species during his travels.{{Sfn|Jolly|Sussman|2006|pp=19\u201340}}{{LoM2 Sfn|pp=27\u201336}}\n\nDuring the 19th century, there was an explosion of new lemur descriptions and names, which later took decades to sort out. During this time, professional collectors gathered specimens for [[museum]]s, [[menagerie]]s, and [[Cabinet of curiosities|cabinets]]. Some of the major collectors were [[Johann Maria Hildebrandt]] and [[Charles Immanuel Forsyth Major]]. From these collections, as well as increasing observations of lemurs in their natural habitats, museum [[systematics|systematists]] including [[Albert G\u00fcnther]] and [[John Edward Gray]] continued to contribute new names for new lemur species. However, the most notable contributions from this century includes the work of [[Alfred Grandidier]], a naturalist and explorer who devoted himself to the study of Madagascar's natural history and local people. With the help of [[Alphonse Milne-Edwards]], most of the diurnal lemurs were illustrated at this time. However, lemur taxonomic nomenclature took its modern form in the 1920s and 1930s, being standardized by [[Ernst Schwarz (zoologist)|Ernst Schwarz]] in 1931.{{Sfn|Jolly|Sussman|2006|pp=19\u201340}}{{LoM2 Sfn|pp=27\u201336}}\n\nAlthough lemur taxonomy had developed, it was not until the 1950s and 1960s that the in-situ (or on-site) study of lemur behavior and ecology began to blossom. [[Jean-Jacques Petter]] and [[Arlette Petter-Rousseaux]] toured Madagascar in 1956 and 1957, surveying many of its lemur species and making important observations about their social groupings and reproduction. In 1960, the year of Madagascar's independence, [[David Attenborough]] introduced lemurs to the West with a commercial film. Under the guidance of [[John Buettner-Janusch]], who founded the [[Duke Lemur Center]] in 1966, [[Alison Jolly]] traveled to Madagascar in 1962 to study the diet and social behavior of the ring-tailed lemur and Verreaux's sifaka at [[Berenty Private Reserve]]. The Petters and Jolly spawned a new era of interest in lemur ecology and behavior and were shortly followed by anthropologists such as [[Alison Richard]], [[Robert Sussman]], [[Ian Tattersall]], and many others. Following the political turmoil of the mid-1970s and Madagascar's revolution, field studies resumed in the 1980s, thanks in part to the renewed involvement of the Duke Lemur Center under the direction of [[Elwyn L. Simons]] and the conservation efforts of [[Patricia Wright]].{{Sfn|Sussman|2003|pp=149\u2013229}}{{Sfn|Jolly|Sussman|2006|pp=19\u201340}}{{LoM2 Sfn|pp=27\u201336}} In the decades that followed, huge strides have been made in lemur studies and many new species have been discovered.{{Sfn|Garbutt|2007|pp=85\u201386}}\n\nEx situ research (or off-site research) is also popular among researchers looking to answer questions that are difficult to test in the field. For example, efforts to [[Full genome sequencing|sequence the genome]] of the gray mouse lemur will help researchers understand which genetic traits set primates apart from other mammals and will ultimately help understand what genomic traits set humans apart from other primates.{{R|2007Yoder}} One of the foremost lemur research facilities is the Duke Lemur Center (DLC) in [[Durham, North Carolina]].

Lemurs are also thought to impart their qualities, good or bad, onto human babies.{{Sfn|Ruud|1970|pp=97\u2013101}} In general, ''fady'' extend beyond a sense of the forbidden, but can include events that bring bad luck.{{R|2001Simons}}\n\nOne example of lemur ''fady'' told around 1970 comes from [[Ambatofinandrahana]] in the [[Fianarantsoa Province]]. According to the account, a man brought a lemur home in a trap, but alive.

There are also stories of an indri that helped a human down from a tree, so they are seen as benefactors.{{Sfn|Ruud|1970|pp=97\u2013101}} Other lemur ''fady'' include the belief that a wife will have ugly children if her husband kills a [[woolly lemur]], or that if a pregnant woman eats a dwarf lemur, her baby will get its beautiful, round eyes.{{Sfn|Ruud|1970|pp=97\u2013101}}\n\nLemurs have also become popular in [[Western culture]] in recent years. The original 2005 animated film ''[[Madagascar (2005 film)|Madagascar]]'' was seen by an estimated 100&nbsp;million people in theaters and 200\u2013300&nbsp;million people on DVD worldwide.{{LoM2 Sfn|pp=85\u201388}} Prior to this movie, ''[[Zoboomafoo]]'', a [[Public Broadcasting Service]] (PBS) children's television series from 1999 to 2001,{{R|WashingtonTimes1021}} helped to popularize sifakas by featuring a live [[Coquerel's sifaka]] from the Duke Lemur Center as well as a puppet.{{R|USAToday0330}} A twenty-episode series called ''Lemur Kingdom'' (in the United States) or ''[[Lemur Street]]'' (in the United Kingdom and Canada) aired in 2008 on [[Animal Planet]]. It combined the typical animal [[documentary film|documentary]] with [[dramatic programming|dramatic narration]] to tell the story of two groups of ring-tailed lemurs at Berenty Private Reserve.{{R|NYDailyNews0208|WashingtonPost0208|AfricaNews1228|TGAM0208}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n==References==\n=== Citations ===\n<!------------------------------------------------------------\nThis article uses list-defined references in conjunction with\nthe {{r}} and {{Sfn}} templates to keep the body text clean.\nPlease follow existing examples within the text and refer to\n\nthe following documentation pages if needed:\n\nList-defined references:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:LDR\n\nTemplate {{r}}:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:R\n\nTemplate {{Sfn}}:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Sfn\n\nSee http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Footnotes for a\ndiscussion of different citation methods and how to generate\nfootnotes using the <ref> tags.\n------------------------------------------------------------->\n{{Reflist|30em|refs=\n<!-- Journal sources -->\n<ref name=\"IUCN\">{{cite web | url = http://www.iucnredlist.org | title = IUCN 2014 | year = 2012 | work =[[IUCN Red List|IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.]] Version 2014.3 | publisher = [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] | accessdate = 12 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"2012Dunkel_et_al\">{{cite journal | last1 = Dunkel | first1 = A.R. | last2 = Zijlstra | first2 = J.S. | last3 = Groves | first3 = C.P. | title = Giant rabbits, marmosets, and British comedies: etymology of lemur names, part 1 | url = http://www.aeecl.org/lemurnews/lemurnews2011_16.pdf | journal = Lemur News | volume = 16 | year = 2012 | issn = 1608-1439 | pages = 64\u201370}}</ref>\n\n<!--unused<ref name=\"2012McLain\">{{Cite journal | last1 = McLain | first1 = A.

They are native only to the island of [[Madagascar]]. Most existing lemurs are small, have a pointed snout, large eyes, and a long tail. They chiefly live in trees ([[arboreal]]), and are active at night ([[nocturnal]]).  \n\nLemurs share resemblance with other primates, but evolved independently from [[monkey]]s and [[ape]]s. Due to Madagascar's highly seasonal climate, [[Evolution of lemurs|lemur evolution]] has produced a level of [[species diversity]] rivaling that of any other primate group. Until shortly after humans arrived on the island around 2,000&nbsp;years ago, there were lemurs as large as a male [[gorilla]]. Most species have been discovered or promoted to full species status since the 1990s; however, lemur [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic classification]] is controversial and depends on which [[Species problem|species concept]] is used. \n\nLemurs range in weight from the {{convert|30|g|oz|adj=on}} [[mouse lemur]] to the {{convert|9|kg|lb|adj=on}} [[indri]]. Lemurs share many common basal primate traits, such as divergent [[digit (anatomy)|digits]] on their hands and feet, and [[nail (anatomy)|nails]] instead of [[claw]]s (in most species). However, their [[Brain-to-body mass ratio|brain-to-body size ratio]] is smaller than that of [[Anthropoidea|anthropoid]] primates. As with all [[strepsirrhine]] primates, they have a \"wet nose\" ([[rhinarium]]). Lemurs are generally the most social of the strepsirrhine primates, and communicate more with scents and vocalizations than with visual signals. Lemurs have a relatively low [[basal metabolic rate]], and as a result may exhibit [[dormancy]] such as [[hibernation]] or [[torpor]]. They also have [[seasonal breeder|seasonal breeding]] and [[dominance (ethology)|female social dominance]]. Most eat a wide variety of fruits and leaves, while some are specialists. Two species of lemurs may coexist in the same forest due to different diets. \n\nLemur research during the 18th and 19th centuries focused on taxonomy and specimen collection. Modern studies of lemur ecology and behavior did not begin in earnest until the 1950s and 1960s. Initially hindered by political issues on Madagascar during the mid-1970s, field studies resumed in the 1980s. Lemurs are important for research because their mix of ancestral characteristics and traits shared with anthropoid primates can yield insights on primate and [[human evolution]]. Many lemur species are threatened with extinction due to habitat loss and hunting. Many lemur species have already gone extinct in the last 2000 years due to human activity, and are collectively referred to as the \"[[Subfossil lemur|subfossil lemurs]]\". Although local traditions generally help protect lemurs and their forests, [[Illegal logging in Madagascar|illegal logging]], widespread poverty, and political instability hinder and undermine conservation efforts. Because of these threats and their declining numbers, the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN) considers lemurs to be the world's most endangered mammals, noting that {{as of|2013|lc=y}} up to 90% of all lemur species face extinction within the next 20 to 25&nbsp;years.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name lemur is derived from the [[Latin]]  ''[[lemures]]'',{{Sfn|Garbutt|2007|pp=85\u201386}} which refers to specters or ghosts that were [[exorcism|exorcised]] during the [[Lemuria (festival)|Lemuria festival]] of ancient Rome.<ref name=\"ley196608\">{{Cite magazine\n |last=Ley\n |first=Willy\n |author=\n |last2=\n |first2=\n |last3=\n |first3=\n |date=August 1966\n |title=Scherazade's Island\n |department=For Your Information\n |url=https://archive.org/stream/Galaxy_v24n06_1966-08#page/n45/mode/2up\n |magazine=Galaxy Science Fiction\n |pages=45\u201355\n |type=\n}}</ref>{{R|2008Lux}}\n\n[[Carl Linnaeus]], the founder of modern [[binomial nomenclature]], gave lemurs their name as early as 1758, when he used it in the [[10th edition of Systema Naturae|10th edition of ''Systema Naturae'']]. He included three species under the genus ''Lemur'': ''Lemur tardigradus'' (the [[red slender loris]], now known as ''Loris tardigradus''), ''Lemur catta'' (the [[ring-tailed lemur]]), and ''Lemur volans'' (the [[Philippine flying lemur|Philippine colugo]], now known as ''Cynocephalus volans'').{{Sfn|Linnaeus|1758|pp=29\u201330}}\n\n{{Quote box\n |quote = ''Lemures dixi hos, quod noctu imprimis obambulant, hominibus quodanmodo similes, & lento passu vagantur.''<br />[I call them lemurs, because they go around mainly by night, in a certain way similar to humans, and roam with a slow pace.]\n |source = [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]], ''Museum Adolphi Friderici Regis''{{Sfn|Linnaeus|1754|p=4}}<br />in reference to the [[red slender loris]]{{R|2012Dunkel_et_al}}\n |width = 25%\n |align = right\n}}\nAlthough the term \"lemur\" was first intended for [[slender loris]]es, it was soon limited to the [[endemic]] Malagasy primates, which have been known as \"lemurs\" ever since.{{Sfn|Tattersall|1982|pp=43\u201344}} According to Linnaeus' own explanation, the name was selected because of the nocturnal activity and slow movements of the slender loris.{{R|2012Dunkel_et_al}} Being familiar with the works of [[Virgil]] and [[Ovid]] and seeing an analogy that fit with his naming scheme, Linnaeus adapted the term \"lemur\" for these nocturnal primates.{{Sfn|Blunt|Stearn|2002|p=252}} \n\nIt was noted in 2012 that it has been commonly and falsely assumed that Linnaeus was referring to the ghost-like appearance, [[Tapetum lucidum|reflective eyes]], and ghostly cries of lemurs.{{R|2012Dunkel_et_al}} It has also been speculated that Linnaeus may also have known that some Malagasy people have held legends that lemurs are the souls of their ancestors,{{Sfn|Nield|2007|p=41}} but this is unlikely given that the name was selected for slender lorises from India.{{R|2012Dunkel_et_al}}\n\n==Evolution==\n{{Main|Evolution of lemurs}}\n\nLemurs are primates belonging to the suborder [[Strepsirrhini]]. Like other strepsirrhine [[primate]]s, such as [[loris]]es, [[potto]]s, and [[galago]]s, they share ancestral (or [[Cladistics#plesiomorphy|plesiomorphic]]) traits with early primates. In this regard, lemurs are popularly confused with ancestral primates; however, lemurs did not give rise to monkeys and apes ([[simian]]s).

Differences in diet, social systems, activity patterns, locomotion, communication, predator avoidance tactics, breeding systems, and intelligence levels help define lemur taxa and set individual species apart from the rest. Although trends frequently distinguish the smaller, nocturnal lemurs from the larger, diurnal lemurs, there are often exceptions that help exemplify the unique and diverse nature of these Malagasy primates.\n\n===Diet===\n[[File:Microcebus murinus -Artis Zoo, Amsterdam, Netherlands-8c.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A tiny mouse lemur holds a cut piece of fruit in its hands and eats|[[Mouse lemur]]s primarily eat fruit, although their diet also includes insects.]]\nLemur diets are highly variable and demonstrate a high degree of plasticity,{{Sfn|Birkinshaw|Colquhoun|2003|pp=1207\u20131220}} although general trends suggest that the smallest species primarily consume fruit and insects ([[omnivore|omnivory]]), while the larger species are more [[herbivore|herbivorous]], consuming mostly plant material.{{Sfn|Sussman|2003|pp=257\u2013269}} As with all primates, hungry lemurs might eat anything that is edible, whether or not the item is one of their preferred foods.{{Sfn|Ankel-Simons|2007|pp=392\u2013514}} For instance, the ring-tailed lemur eats insects and small [[vertebrate]]s when necessary{{Sfn|Sussman|2003|pp=257\u2013269}}{{LoM2 Sfn|pp=209\u2013323}} and as a result it is commonly viewed as an opportunistic omnivore.{{Sfn|Cuozzo|Yamashita|2006|pp=67\u201396}} [[Coquerel's giant mouse lemur]] (''Mirza coquereli'') is mostly [[frugivore|frugivorous]], but will consume insect secretions during the dry season.{{Sfn|Sussman|2003|pp=257\u2013269}}\n\nA common assumption in [[mammalogy]] is that small mammals cannot subsist entirely on plant material and must have a high-calorie diet in order to survive. As a result, it was thought that the diet of tiny primates must be high in protein-containing insects ([[insectivore|insectivory]]). Research has shown, however, that mouse lemurs, the smallest living primates, consume more fruit than insects, contradicting the popular hypothesis.{{Sfn|Ankel-Simons|2007|pp=392\u2013514}}{{Sfn|Sussman|2003|pp=257\u2013269}}\n\nPlant material makes up the majority of most lemur diets. Members of at least 109 of all known plant families in Madagascar (55%) are exploited by lemurs. Since lemurs are primarily arboreal, most of these exploited species are [[woody plant]]s, including [[tree]]s, [[shrub]]s, or [[liana]]s. Only the ring-tailed lemur, the [[bamboo lemur]]s (genus ''Hapalemur''), and the [[black-and-white ruffed lemur]] (''Varecia variegata'') are known to consume [[herb]]s. While Madagascar is rich in [[fern]] diversity, these plants are rarely eaten by lemurs. One possible reason for this is that ferns lack flowers, fruits, and seeds\u2014common food items in lemur diets. They also occur close to the ground, while lemurs spend most of their time in the trees. Lastly, ferns have an unpleasant taste due to the high content of [[tannin]]s in their [[frond]]s. Likewise, [[mangrove]]s appear to be rarely exploited by lemurs due to their high tannin content.{{Sfn|Birkinshaw|Colquhoun|2003|pp=1207\u20131220}} Some lemurs appear to have evolved responses against common plant defenses, however, such as tannins and alkaloids.{{Sfn|Powzyk|Mowry|2006|pp=353\u2013368}} The [[golden bamboo lemur]] (''Hapalemur aureus''), for instance, eats giant bamboo (''[[Cathariostachys madagascariensis]]''), which contains high levels of [[cyanide]]. This lemur can consume twelve times the typically lethal dose for most mammals on a daily basis; the physiological mechanisms that protect it from cyanide poisoning are unknown.{{Sfn|Sussman|2003|pp=149\u2013229}} At the [[Duke Lemur Center]] (DLC) in the United States, lemurs that roam the outdoor enclosures have been observed eating [[poison ivy]] (''Taxicodendron radicans''), yet have shown no ill effects.{{Sfn|Ankel-Simons|2007|pp=284\u2013391}}\n\n[[File:Prolemur simus Cedric Girard-Buttoz.jpg|thumb|right|upright|alt=A brown-colored lemur clings to a shaft of giant bamboo while eating a fragment in its hands.|Up to 95% of the [[greater bamboo lemur]]'s diet consists of bamboo.{{LoM2 Sfn|pp=209\u2013323}}]]\nMany of the larger lemur species consume leaves ([[folivore|folivory]]),{{Sfn|Birkinshaw|Colquhoun|2003|pp=1207\u20131220}} particularly the indriids.{{Sfn|Garbutt|2007|pp=176\u2013204}} However, some smaller lemurs such as [[sportive lemur]]s (genus ''Lepilemur'') and [[woolly lemur]]s (genus ''Avahi'') also primarily eat leaves, making them the smallest primates that do so.{{Sfn|Thalmann|Ganzhorn|2003|pp=1336\u20131340}} The smallest of the lemurs generally do not eat much leaf matter.{{Sfn|Birkinshaw|Colquhoun|2003|pp=1207\u20131220}} Collectively, lemurs have been documented consuming leaves from at least 82 native plant families and 15 alien plant families. Lemurs tend to be selective in their consumption of the part of the leaf or shoot as well as its age. Often, young leaves are preferred over mature leaves.{{Sfn|Birkinshaw|Colquhoun|2003|pp=1207\u20131220}}\n\nMany lemurs that eat leaves tend to do so during times of fruit scarcity, sometimes suffering weight loss as a result.{{Sfn|Wright|2006|pp=385\u2013402}} Most lemur species, including most of the smallest lemurs and excluding some of the indriids, predominantly eat fruit ([[frugivore|frugivory]]) when available. Collectively, lemurs have been documented consuming fruit from at least 86&nbsp;native plant families and 15&nbsp;alien plant families. As with most tropical fruit eaters, the lemur diet is dominated by fruit from ''[[Ficus]]'' (fig) species.{{Sfn|Birkinshaw|Colquhoun|2003|pp=1207\u20131220}} In many anthropoid primates, fruit is a primary source of [[vitamin C]], but unlike anthropoid primates, lemurs (and all strepsirrhines) can synthesize their own vitamin C.{{R|1969Nakajima}} Historically, captive lemur diets high in vitamin C-rich fruits have been thought to cause [[hemosiderosis]], a type of [[iron overload|iron overload disorder]], since vitamin C increases iron absorption. Although lemurs in captivity have been shown to be prone to hemosiderosis, the frequency of the disease varies across institutions and may depend on the diet, husbandry protocols, and genetic stock. Assumptions about the problem need to be tested separately for each species.{{R|2006Williams}} The ring-tailed lemur, for instance, seems to be less prone to the disorder than other lemur species.{{R|2006Glenn}}\n\nOnly eight species of lemur are known to be [[seed predation|seed predators]] (granivores), but this may be under-reported since most observations only report fruit consumption and do not investigate whether the seeds are consumed as well. These lemurs include some indriids, such as the [[diademed sifaka]] (''Propithecus diadema''), the [[golden-crowned sifaka]] (''Propithecus tattersalli''), the indri,{{Sfn|Sussman|2003|pp=149\u2013229}}{{Sfn|Richard|2003|pp=1345\u20131348}} and the aye-aye. The aye-aye, which specializes in structurally defended resources, can chew through ''[[Canarium]]'' seeds, which are harder than the seeds that [[New World monkey]]s are known to break open.{{Sfn|Sterling|McCreless|2006|pp=159\u2013184}} At least 36&nbsp;genera from 23&nbsp;families of plants are targeted by lemur seed predators.{{Sfn|Birkinshaw|Colquhoun|2003|pp=1207\u20131220}}\n\n[[Inflorescence]]s (clusters of flowers) of at least 60&nbsp;plant families are eaten by lemurs ranging in size from the tiny mouse lemurs to the relatively large ruffed lemurs. If the flowers are not exploited, sometimes the nectar is consumed ([[nectarivore|nectarivory]]) along with the pollen ([[palynivore|palynivory]]). At least 24&nbsp;native species from 17&nbsp;plant families are targeted for nectar or pollen consumption.{{Sfn|Birkinshaw|Colquhoun|2003|pp=1207\u20131220}}\n\nBark and plant exudates such as [[tree sap]] are consumed by a few lemur species. The exploitation of exudates has been reported in 18 plant species and only in the dry regions in the south and west of Madagascar. Only the [[Masoala fork-marked lemur]] (''Phaner furcifer'') and Coquerel's giant mouse lemur regularly consume tree sap. Bark has never been reported as an important food item in lemur diets, but at least four species eat it: the aye-aye, the [[red-tailed sportive lemur]] (''Lepilemur ruficaudatus''), the [[common brown lemur]] (''Eulemur fulvus''), and [[Verreaux's sifaka]] (''Propithecus verreauxi''). Most bark feeding is directly linked to exudate feeding, except for the aye-aye's bark feeding on ''[[Afzelia bijuga]]'' (genus ''[[Afzelia]]'') at [[Nosy Mangabe]] in the northeast.{{Sfn|Birkinshaw|Colquhoun|2003|pp=1207\u20131220}}\n\nSoil consumption ([[geophagy]]) has also been reported and likely helps with [[digestion]], provides minerals and salts, and helps absorb toxins. Sifakas have been observed eating soil from [[termite]] mounds, possibly adding beneficial [[Gut flora|intestinal flora]] to aid the digestion of [[cellulose]] from their folivorous diet.{{Sfn|Ankel-Simons|2007|pp=284\u2013391}}\n\n===Social systems===\n[[File:CHEIROGALEUS-1.JPG|thumb|upright|alt=A small squirrel-like lemur, with a long, slender body and a thick tail, looks over its shoulder from a palm tree.|[[Dwarf lemur]]s are solitary but social, foraging alone but often sleeping in groups.]]\n\nLemurs are social and live in groups that usually include fewer than 15&nbsp;individuals.{{Sfn|Sussman|2003|pp=149\u2013229}} Observed [[social organisation|social organization]] patterns include \"[[solitary but social]]\", \"[[Fission-fusion society|fission-fusion]]\", \"[[pair bond]]s\", and \"[[multi-male group]]\".{{Sfn|Sussman|2003|pp=3\u201337}} Nocturnal lemurs are mostly solitary but social, foraging alone at night but often nesting in groups during the day. The degree of socialization varies by species, gender, location, and season.{{Sfn|Sussman|2003|pp=107\u2013148}}{{Sfn|Sussman|2003|pp=257\u2013269}} In many nocturnal species, for instance, the females, along with their young, will share nests with other females and possibly one male, whose larger [[home range]] happens to overlap one or more female nesting groups. In [[sportive lemur]]s and [[fork-marked lemur]]s, one or two females may share a home range, possibly with a male. In addition to sharing nests, they will also interact vocally or physically with their range-mate while they forage at night.{{Sfn|Sussman|2003|pp=257\u2013269}} Diurnal lemurs exhibit many of the social systems seen in monkeys and apes,{{Sfn|Sussman|2003|pp=149\u2013229}}{{Sfn|Sussman|2003|pp=257\u2013269}} living in relatively permanent and cohesive social groups. Multi-male groups are the most common, just as they are in most anthropoid primates. [[True lemur]]s utilize this social system, often living in groups of ten or less. Ruffed lemurs have been shown to live in fission-fusion societies,{{Sfn|Sussman|2003|pp=257\u2013269}} and Indri forms pair bonds.{{Sfn|Sussman|2003|pp=3\u201337}}\n\nSome lemurs exhibit female [[philopatry]], where females stay within their natal range and the males migrate upon reaching maturity, and in other species both sexes will migrate.{{Sfn|Sussman|2003|pp=149\u2013229}} In some cases, female philopatry may help explain the evolution of female-bonded multi-male groups, such as those of the ring-tailed lemur, [[Milne-Edwards' sifaka]] (''Propithecus edwardsi''), and the Verreaux's sifaka. Their ancestors may have been more solitary, with females that lived in mother-daughter pairs (or dyads). Over time, these dyads may have allied themselves with other neighboring mother-daughter dyads in order to defend more distributed resources in a wide home range. If this is true, then multi-male groups in lemurs may differ fundamentally in their internal structure from those in [[catarrhini|catarrhine]] primates (Old World monkeys and apes).{{R|1998Jolly}}\n\n[[File:Lemur catta 002.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Two adult ring-tailed lemurs lick each other's face while a juvenile moves around on its mother's back.|Social grooming serves many functions for social lemurs.]]\n\nThe presence of female [[dominance (ethology)|social dominance]] sets lemurs apart from most other primates and mammals;{{Sfn|Sussman|2003|pp=149\u2013229}}{{Sfn|Sussman|2003|pp=257\u2013269}}{{Sfn|Rowe|1996|p=27}}{{R|2008Dunham}} in most primate societies, males are dominant unless females band together to form coalitions that displace them.{{R|1990Young}} However, many ''Eulemur'' species are exceptions{{Sfn|Sussman|2003|pp=257\u2013269}}{{Sfn|Overdorff|Johnson|2003|pp=1320\u20131324}} and the [[greater bamboo lemur]] (''Prolemur simus'') does not exhibit female dominance.{{Sfn|Tan|2006|pp=369\u2013382}} When females are dominant within a group, the way they maintain dominance varies. Ring-tailed lemur males act submissively with or without signs of female aggression. Male [[crowned lemur]]s (''Eulemur coronatus''), on the other hand, will only act submissively when females act aggressively towards them. Female aggression is often associated with, but not limited to, feeding.{{R|2002Digby}}\n\nThere have been many hypotheses that have attempted to explain why lemurs exhibit female social dominance while other primates with similar social structures do not,{{Sfn|Sussman|2003|pp=149\u2013229}}{{R|2008Dunham}} but no consensus has been reached after decades of research. The dominant view in the literature states that female dominance is an advantageous trait given the high costs of reproduction and the scarcity of resources available.{{R|2008Dunham}} Indeed, female dominance has been shown to be linked to increased maternal investment.{{R|1990Young}} However, when reproductive costs and extreme seasonality of resources were compared across primates, other primates demonstrated male dominance under conditions that were similar to or more challenging than those faced by lemurs. In 2008, a new hypothesis revised this model using simple [[game theory]]. It was argued that when two individuals were equally matched in fighting capacity, the one with the most need would win the conflict since it would have the most to lose. Consequently, the female, with higher resource needs for pregnancy, lactation, and maternal care, was more likely to win in resource conflicts with equally sized males. This, however, assumed monomorphism between sexes.{{R|2008Dunham}} The following year, a new hypothesis was proposed to explain monomorphism, stating that because most female lemurs are only sexually receptive for a day or two each year, males can utilize a more passive form of mate guarding: [[Mating plug|copulatory plugs]], which block the female reproductive tract, preventing other males from successfully mating with her, and thus reducing the need for aggression and the evolutionary drive for sexual dimorphism.{{R|2009Dunham}}\n\nIn general, levels of [[agonistic behaviour|agonism]] (or aggression) tend to correlate with relative canine height. The ring-tailed lemur has long, sharp upper canine teeth in both sexes, and it also exhibits high levels of agonism. The Indri, on the other hand, has smaller canines and exhibits lower levels of aggression.{{Sfn|Godfrey|Jungers|Schwartz|2006|pp=41\u201364}} When neighboring groups of the same species defend their territories, the conflict can take the form of ritualized defense. In sifakas, these ritualized combats involve staring, growling, scent-marking, and leaping to occupy certain sections of the tree. The indri defends its home range with ritualized \"singing\" battles.{{Sfn|Sussman|2003|pp=149\u2013229}}\n\nLike other primates, lemurs groom socially ([[Social grooming|allogroom]]) to ease tensions and solidify relationships. They groom in greeting, when waking up, when settling in for sleep, between mother and infant, in juvenile relations, and for sexual advances.{{R|1966Jolly}} Unlike anthropoid primates, who part the fur with the hands and pick out particles with the fingers or mouth, lemurs groom with their tongue and scraping with their toothcomb.{{Sfn|Sussman|2003|pp=149\u2013229}}{{R|1966Jolly}} Despite the differences in technique, lemurs groom with the same frequency and for the same reasons as anthropoids.{{R|1966Jolly}}\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Activity patterns===\nThe [[Chronobiology|biological rhythm]] can vary from nocturnal in smaller lemurs to diurnal in most larger lemurs.

Some lemurs [[defecation|defecate]] in specific areas, otherwise known as [[latrine behavior]]. Although many animals exhibit this behavior, it is a rare trait among primates. Latrine behavior can represent territorial marking and aid in interspecies signaling.{{Sfn|Ankel-Simons|2007|pp=392\u2013514}}\n\nCompared to other mammals, primates in general are very vocal, and lemurs are no exception.{{Sfn|Ankel-Simons|2007|pp=392\u2013514}} Some lemur species have extensive vocal repertoires, including the ring-tailed lemur and ruffed lemurs.{{Sfn|Jolly|2003|pp=1329\u20131331}}{{Sfn|Vasey|2003|pp=1332\u20131336}} Some of the most common calls among lemurs are predator alarm calls.

However, to endure the extreme dry season, three of the five species utilize different dietary patterns and their underlying physiological traits to allow them to coexist: fork-marked lemurs feed on tree gum, sportive lemurs feed on leaves, and giant mouse lemurs sometimes feed on insect secretions. The other two species, the gray mouse lemur and the fat-tailed dwarf lemur (''Cheirogaleus medius''), avoid competition through reduced activity. The gray mouse lemur uses bouts of torpor, while the fat-tailed dwarf lemur hibernates completely.{{Sfn|Sussman|2003|pp=107\u2013148}} Similarly, on the east coast entire genera focus on specific food to avoid too much niche overlap. True lemurs and ruffed lemurs are frugivorous, indriids are folivorous, and bamboo lemurs specialize in bamboo and other grasses. Once again, seasonal dietary differences as well as subtle differences in [[substrate (biology)|substrate]] preferences, [[Tropical rainforest#Layers|forest strata]] used, activity cycle, and social organization enable lemur species to coexist, although this time the species are more closely related and have similar niches.{{Sfn|Sussman|2003|pp=149\u2013229}} A classic example involves [[Niche differentiation|resource partitioning]] between three species of bamboo lemur that live in close proximity in small forested areas: the golden bamboo lemur, the greater bamboo lemur, and the [[eastern lesser bamboo lemur]] (''Hapalemur griseus'').

[[Alison Jolly]] began her research here in 1962.]]\nLemurs are mentioned in sailors' voyage logs as far back as 1608 and in 1658 that at least seven lemur species were described in detail by the French merchant, [[\u00c9tienne de Flacourt]], who may also have been the only westerner to see and chronicle the existence of a giant (now extinct) lemur, which he called the ''[[Subfossil lemur#Lingering populations|tretretretre]]''. Around 1703 merchants and sailors began bringing lemurs back to Europe, at which time [[James Petiver]], an apothecary in London, described and illustrated the mongoose lemur. Starting in 1751, the London illustrator [[George Edwards (naturalist)|George Edwards]] began describing and illustrating some lemur species, of which a few were included in various editions of ''[[Systema Naturae]]'' by Carl Linnaeus. In the 1760s and 1770s, French naturalists [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon]] and [[Louis-Jean-Marie Daubenton]] began describing the anatomy of several lemur species. The first traveling naturalist to comment on lemurs was [[Philibert Commer\u00e7on]] in 1771, although it was [[Pierre Sonnerat]] who recorded a greater variety of lemur species during his travels.{{Sfn|Jolly|Sussman|2006|pp=19\u201340}}{{LoM2 Sfn|pp=27\u201336}}\n\nDuring the 19th century, there was an explosion of new lemur descriptions and names, which later took decades to sort out. During this time, professional collectors gathered specimens for [[museum]]s, [[menagerie]]s, and [[Cabinet of curiosities|cabinets]]. Some of the major collectors were [[Johann Maria Hildebrandt]] and [[Charles Immanuel Forsyth Major]]. From these collections, as well as increasing observations of lemurs in their natural habitats, museum [[systematics|systematists]] including [[Albert G\u00fcnther]] and [[John Edward Gray]] continued to contribute new names for new lemur species. However, the most notable contributions from this century includes the work of [[Alfred Grandidier]], a naturalist and explorer who devoted himself to the study of Madagascar's natural history and local people. With the help of [[Alphonse Milne-Edwards]], most of the diurnal lemurs were illustrated at this time. However, lemur taxonomic nomenclature took its modern form in the 1920s and 1930s, being standardized by [[Ernst Schwarz (zoologist)|Ernst Schwarz]] in 1931.{{Sfn|Jolly|Sussman|2006|pp=19\u201340}}{{LoM2 Sfn|pp=27\u201336}}\n\nAlthough lemur taxonomy had developed, it was not until the 1950s and 1960s that the in-situ (or on-site) study of lemur behavior and ecology began to blossom. [[Jean-Jacques Petter]] and [[Arlette Petter-Rousseaux]] toured Madagascar in 1956 and 1957, surveying many of its lemur species and making important observations about their social groupings and reproduction. In 1960, the year of Madagascar's independence, [[David Attenborough]] introduced lemurs to the West with a commercial film. Under the guidance of [[John Buettner-Janusch]], who founded the [[Duke Lemur Center]] in 1966, [[Alison Jolly]] traveled to Madagascar in 1962 to study the diet and social behavior of the ring-tailed lemur and Verreaux's sifaka at [[Berenty Private Reserve]]. The Petters and Jolly spawned a new era of interest in lemur ecology and behavior and were shortly followed by anthropologists such as [[Alison Richard]], [[Robert Sussman]], [[Ian Tattersall]], and many others. Following the political turmoil of the mid-1970s and Madagascar's revolution, field studies resumed in the 1980s, thanks in part to the renewed involvement of the Duke Lemur Center under the direction of [[Elwyn L. Simons]] and the conservation efforts of [[Patricia Wright]].{{Sfn|Sussman|2003|pp=149\u2013229}}{{Sfn|Jolly|Sussman|2006|pp=19\u201340}}{{LoM2 Sfn|pp=27\u201336}} In the decades that followed, huge strides have been made in lemur studies and many new species have been discovered.{{Sfn|Garbutt|2007|pp=85\u201386}}\n\nEx situ research (or off-site research) is also popular among researchers looking to answer questions that are difficult to test in the field. For example, efforts to [[Full genome sequencing|sequence the genome]] of the gray mouse lemur will help researchers understand which genetic traits set primates apart from other mammals and will ultimately help understand what genomic traits set humans apart from other primates.{{R|2007Yoder}} One of the foremost lemur research facilities is the Duke Lemur Center (DLC) in [[Durham, North Carolina]].

This international NGO supports Madagascar's [[Parc Ivoloina]], helps protect [[Betampona Reserve]] and other protected areas, and promotes field research, breeding programs, conservation planning, and education in zoos.{{Sfn|Sargent|Anderson|2003|pp=1543\u20131545}} One of their major projects involved the release of captive black-and-white ruffed lemurs, designed to help restock the dwindling population within Betampona Reserve.{{Sfn|Sargent|Anderson|2003|pp=1543\u20131545}}{{Sfn|Britt|Iambana|Welch|Katz|2003|pp=1545\u20131551}}\n\n[[Habitat corridor]]s are needed for linking these protected areas so that small populations are not isolated.{{Sfn|Mittermeier|Konstant|Rylands|2003|pp=1538\u20131543}} In {{Nowrap|September 2003}} in [[Durban]], South Africa, Madagascar's former president [[Marc Ravalomanana]] promised to triple the size of the island's protected areas in five years.{{LoM2 Sfn|pp=15\u201317}} This became known as the \"Durban Vision\".{{LoM2 Sfn|pp=52\u201384}} In June&nbsp;2007, the [[World Heritage Committee]] included a sizable portion of Madagascar's eastern rainforests as a new [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]].{{R|2007Yoder}}\n\nDebt relief may help Madagascar protect its biodiversity.{{R|ScienceDaily_14Jun08}} With the [[2009 Malagasy political crisis|political crisis]] in 2009, [[Illegal logging in Madagascar|illegal logging]] has proliferated and now threatens rainforests in the northeast, including its lemur inhabitants and the ecotourism that the local communities rely upon.{{R|2009eStandardsForum}}\n\nCaptive lemur populations are maintained locally and outside of Madagascar in many zoos, although the diversity of species is limited.

It has a very short tail and its face, hands, and upper back are black while the rest of it is white.|The [[indri]] is known locally as ''babakoto'', which translates to \"Ancestor of Man\".]]\n\nIn Malagasy culture lemurs, and animals in general, have [[soul]]s (''ambiroa'') which can get revenge if mocked while alive or if killed in a cruel fashion. Because of this, lemurs, like many other elements of daily life, have been a source of [[taboo]]s, known locally as ''fady'', which can be based around stories with four basic principles. A village or region may believe that a certain type of lemur may be the [[ancestor]] of the clan. They may also believe that a lemur's spirit may get revenge. Alternatively, the animal may appear as a benefactor. Lemurs are also thought to impart their qualities, good or bad, onto human babies.{{Sfn|Ruud|1970|pp=97\u2013101}} In general, ''fady'' extend beyond a sense of the forbidden, but can include events that bring bad luck.{{R|2001Simons}}\n\nOne example of lemur ''fady'' told around 1970 comes from [[Ambatofinandrahana]] in the [[Fianarantsoa Province]]. According to the account, a man brought a lemur home in a trap, but alive. His children wanted to keep the lemur as a pet, but when the father told them it was not a domestic animal, the children asked to kill it. After the children tortured the lemur, it eventually died and was eaten. A short time later, all the children died of illness. As a result, the father declared that anyone who tortures lemurs for fun shall \"be destroyed and have no descendants.\"{{Sfn|Ruud|1970|pp=97\u2013101}}\n\n''Fady'' can not only help protect lemurs and their forests under stable [[socioeconomics|socioeconomic situations]], but they can also lead to discrimination and persecution if a lemur is known to bring bad fortune, for instance, if it walks through town.{{Sfn|Goodman|Ganzhorn|Rakotondravony|2003|pp=1159\u20131186}}{{Sfn|Ruud|1970|pp=97\u2013101}} In other ways, ''fady'' does not protect all lemurs equally. For example, although the hunting and eating of certain species may be taboo, other species may not share that same protection and are therefore targeted instead.{{Sfn|Sussman|2003|pp=149\u2013229}}{{Sfn|Ruud|1970|pp=97\u2013101}} ''Fady'' can vary from village to village within the same region.{{Sfn|Sterling|2003|pp=1348\u20131351}} If people move to a new village or region, their ''fady'' may not apply to the lemur species that are locally present, making them available for consumption. ''Fady'' restrictions on lemur meat can be relaxed in times of famine and drought.{{Sfn|Goodman|Ganzhorn|Rakotondravony|2003|pp=1159\u20131186}}\n\nThe aye-aye is almost universally viewed unfavorably across Madagascar,{{R|2001Simons}} though the tales vary from village to village and region to region. If people see an aye-aye, they may kill it and hang the corpse on a pole near a road outside of town (so others can carry the bad fortunes away) or burn their village and move.{{Sfn|Garbutt|2007|pp=205\u2013207}}{{Sfn|Sterling|2003|pp=1348\u20131351}} The superstitions behind aye-aye ''fady'' include beliefs that they kill and eat chickens or people, that they kill people in their sleep by cutting their aortic vein,{{Sfn|Goodman|Ganzhorn|Rakotondravony|2003|pp=1159\u20131186}} that they embody ancestral spirits,{{Sfn|Sterling|2003|pp=1348\u20131351}} or that they warn of illness, death, or bad luck in the family.{{Sfn|Ankel-Simons|2007|pp=48\u2013161}}{{Sfn|Garbutt|2007|pp=205\u2013207}} As of 1970, the people of the [[Marolambo]] District in the [[Toamasina Province]] feared the aye-aye because they believed it had supernatural powers. Because of this, no one was allowed to mock, kill, or eat one.{{Sfn|Ruud|1970|pp=97\u2013101}}\n\nThere are also widespread ''fady'' about indri and sifakas. They are often protected from hunting and consumption because of their resemblance to humans and their ancestors, mostly due to their large size and upright or [[orthograde posture]]. The resemblance is even stronger for indri, which lack the long tail of most living lemurs.{{Sfn|Thalmann|Powzyk|2003|pp=1342\u20131345}}{{Sfn|Irwin|2006|pp=305\u2013326}} Known locally as ''babakoto'' (\"Ancestor of Man\"), the indri is sometimes seen as the progenitor of the family or clan. There are also stories of an indri that helped a human down from a tree, so they are seen as benefactors.{{Sfn|Ruud|1970|pp=97\u2013101}} Other lemur ''fady'' include the belief that a wife will have ugly children if her husband kills a [[woolly lemur]], or that if a pregnant woman eats a dwarf lemur, her baby will get its beautiful, round eyes.{{Sfn|Ruud|1970|pp=97\u2013101}}\n\nLemurs have also become popular in [[Western culture]] in recent years. The original 2005 animated film ''[[Madagascar (2005 film)|Madagascar]]'' was seen by an estimated 100&nbsp;million people in theaters and 200\u2013300&nbsp;million people on DVD worldwide.{{LoM2 Sfn|pp=85\u201388}} Prior to this movie, ''[[Zoboomafoo]]'', a [[Public Broadcasting Service]] (PBS) children's television series from 1999 to 2001,{{R|WashingtonTimes1021}} helped to popularize sifakas by featuring a live [[Coquerel's sifaka]] from the Duke Lemur Center as well as a puppet.{{R|USAToday0330}} A twenty-episode series called ''Lemur Kingdom'' (in the United States) or ''[[Lemur Street]]'' (in the United Kingdom and Canada) aired in 2008 on [[Animal Planet]]. It combined the typical animal [[documentary film|documentary]] with [[dramatic programming|dramatic narration]] to tell the story of two groups of ring-tailed lemurs at Berenty Private Reserve.{{R|NYDailyNews0208|WashingtonPost0208|AfricaNews1228|TGAM0208}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n==References==\n=== Citations ===\n<!------------------------------------------------------------\nThis article uses list-defined references in conjunction with\nthe {{r}} and {{Sfn}} templates to keep the body text clean.\nPlease follow existing examples within the text and refer to\n\nthe following documentation pages if needed:\n\nList-defined references:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:LDR\n\nTemplate {{r}}:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:R\n\nTemplate {{Sfn}}:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Sfn\n\nSee http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Footnotes for a\ndiscussion of different citation methods and how to generate\nfootnotes using the <ref> tags.\n------------------------------------------------------------->\n{{Reflist|30em|refs=\n<!-- Journal sources -->\n<ref name=\"IUCN\">{{cite web | url = http://www.iucnredlist.org | title = IUCN 2014 | year = 2012 | work =[[IUCN Red List|IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.]] Version 2014.3 | publisher = [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] | accessdate = 12 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"2012Dunkel_et_al\">{{cite journal | last1 = Dunkel | first1 = A.R. | last2 = Zijlstra | first2 = J.S. | last3 = Groves | first3 = C.P. | title = Giant rabbits, marmosets, and British comedies: etymology of lemur names, part 1 | url = http://www.aeecl.org/lemurnews/lemurnews2011_16.pdf | journal = Lemur News | volume = 16 | year = 2012 | issn = 1608-1439 | pages = 64\u201370}}</ref>\n\n<!--unused<ref name=\"2012McLain\">{{Cite journal | last1 = McLain | first1 = A.

However, it is also fed to smaller domesticated animals such as [[Domestic rabbit|rabbits]] and [[guinea pig]]s. [[Domestic pig|Pigs]] may also be fed hay, but they do not [[Digestion|digest]] it as efficiently as [[herbivore]]s.\n\nHay can be used as animal [[fodder]] when or where there is not enough [[pasture]] or [[rangeland]] on which to [[Grazing|graze]] an animal, when grazing is not feasible due to weather (such as during the winter), or when lush pasture by itself would be too rich for the health of the animal. It is also fed when an animal is unable to access pasture, e.g. the animal is being kept in a [[stable]] or [[barn]].\n\n==Composition==\nCommonly used plants for hay include mixtures of [[pasture|grasses]] such as [[ryegrass]] (''Lolium'' species), [[Timothy-grass|timothy]], [[Bromus|brome]], [[fescue]], [[Cynodon|Bermuda grass]], [[orchard grass]], and other species, depending on region. Hay may also include [[legume]]s, such as [[alfalfa]] (lucerne) and [[clover]]s ([[Trifolium pratense|red]], [[Trifolium repens|white]] and [[Subterranean clover|subterranean]]). Legumes in hay are ideally cut pre-bloom. Other pasture [[forb]]s are also sometimes a part of the mix, though these plants are not necessarily desired as certain forbs are toxic to some animals.\n\n[[Oat]], [[barley]], and [[wheat]] plant materials are occasionally cut green and made into hay for animal [[fodder]]; however they are more usually used in the form of [[straw]], a harvest byproduct where the stems and dead leaves are baled after the grain has been harvested and [[Threshing|threshed]]. Straw is used mainly for animal bedding. Although straw is also used as fodder, particularly as a source of [[dietary fiber]], it has lower nutritional value than hay.\n\nIt is the leaf and seed material in the hay that determines its quality, because they contain more of the [[nutrition]] value for the animal than the stems do.<ref name=\"Deere-1957\">{{Citation |author=Deere and Company |authorlink=John Deere |year=1957 |title=The Operation, Care, and Repair of Farm Machinery |edition=28th |chapter=23: Hay conditioners |publisher=Deere and Company |location=Moline, Illinois, USA |oclc=965865819 |asin=B000FNB7WM |postscript=.}}</ref>{{rp|194}} Farmers try to harvest hay at the point when the seed heads are not quite ripe and the leaf is at its maximum when the grass is mowed in the field. The cut material is allowed to dry so that the bulk of the moisture is removed but the leafy material is still robust enough to be picked up from the ground by machinery and processed into storage in bales, stacks or pits. Methods of haymaking thus aim to minimize the shattering and falling away of the leaves during handling.<ref name=\"Deere-1957\"/>{{rp|194}} \n[[File:GrassHay1.jpg|thumb|left|upright|1.5|Close view of loose grass hay.<!--fluffed out from a newly-opened bale-->]]\n\n{{Anchor|Weather, especially at harvesting}}\nHay is very sensitive to weather conditions, especially when it is harvested. In drought conditions, both seed and leaf production are stunted, making hay that has a high ratio of dry coarse stems that have very low nutritional values. If the weather is too wet, the cut hay may spoil in the field before it can be baled. Thus the biggest challenge and risk for farmers in producing hay crops is the weather, especially the weather of the particular few weeks when the plants are at the best age/maturity for hay. A lucky break in the weather often moves the haymaking tasks (such as mowing, tedding, and baling) to the top priority on the farm's to-do list. This is reflected in the [[idiom]] ''to [[wikt:make hay while the sun shines|make hay while the sun shines]]''. Hay that was too wet at cutting may develop rot and mold after being baled, creating the potential for toxins to form in the feed, which could make the animals sick.\n\nAfter harvest, hay also has to be stored in a manner to prevent it from getting wet. Mold and spoilage reduce nutritional value and may cause illness in animals.  A [[symbiotic]] fungus in [[fescue]] may cause illness in horses and cattle.<ref>{{Citation|url=http://www.uaex.edu/Other_Areas/publications/PDF/FSA-3042.pdf\n|publisher=[[University of Arkansas]] Division of Agriculture |title=Managing Fescue for Horses FSA3042 |quote=Cattle grazing fescue often develop a chronic, unthrifty condition, especially apparent during the summer months. In addition, some cattle occasionally develop lameness and lose portions of their feet and tails during fall and winter. Some mares grazing fescue have reproductive problems during the last trimester of pregnancy. |first1=Steven M.|last1=Jones|first2=Mark|last2=Russell}}</ref>\n[[File:Round hay bale, partially eaten.jpg|right|thumb |Poor quality hay is dry, bleached out and coarse-stemmed. Sometimes, hay stored outdoors will look like this on the outside but still be green inside the bale. A dried, bleached or coarse bale is still edible and provides some nutritional value as long as it is dry and not moldy, dusty, or rotting.]]\n\nThe successful harvest of maximum yields of high-quality hay is entirely dependent on the coincident occurrence of optimum crop, field, and weather conditions. When this occurs, there may be a period of intense activity on the hay farm while harvest proceeds until weather conditions become unfavourable.\n\n==Feeding hay==\n[[File:Freshly cut hay in alpine meadows in the mountainous region of Buryatia.jpg|thumb|Freshly cut hay in alpine meadows in the mountainous region of Buryatia]]\n{{Main|Equine nutrition|Cattle feeding|Sheep husbandry}}\n{{See also|Fodder|Ruminant|Cecum}}\nHay or grass is the foundation of the diet for all grazing animals and can provide as much as 100% of the [[fodder]] required for an animal. Hay is usually fed to an animal in place of allowing the animal to graze on grasses in a [[pasture]], particularly in the winter or during times when drought or other conditions make pasture unavailable. Animals that can eat hay vary in the types of grasses suitable for consumption, the ways they consume hay, and how they digest it. Therefore, different types of animals require hay that consists of similar plants to what they would eat while grazing, and likewise, plants that are toxic to an animal in pasture are also toxic if they are dried into hay.\n[[File:HorsesAndHay.jpg|left|thumb|upright=1.10|Horses eating hay]]\n\nMost animals are fed hay in two daily feedings, morning and evening. However, this schedule is more for the convenience of humans, as most grazing animals on pasture naturally consume [[fodder]] in multiple feedings throughout the day. Some animals, especially those being raised for meat, may be given enough hay that they simply are able to eat all day. Other animals, especially those that are ridden or driven as [[working animal]]s, are only free to eat when not working, and may be given a more limited amount of hay to prevent them from getting too fat. The proper amount of hay and the type of hay required varies somewhat between different species. <!-- and is too complex to fully explain here, hence the \"main\" tags, add more if needed--> Some animals are also fed concentrated feeds such as [[grain]] or vitamin supplements in addition to hay. In most cases, hay or pasture [[forage]] must make up 50% or more of the diet by weight.\n\nOne of the most significant differences in hay digestion is between [[ruminant]] animals, such as [[cattle]] and [[sheep]]; and nonruminant, [[hindgut fermentation|hindgut fermentors]], such as [[horse]]s. Both types of animals can digest [[cellulose]] in grass and hay, but do so by different mechanisms. Because of the four-chambered stomach of cattle, they are often able to break down older forage and have more tolerance of mold and changes in diet. <!--please verify this statement, I am over-generalizing, I know--> The single-chambered stomach and [[cecum]] or \"hindgut\" of the horse uses bacterial processes to break down cellulose that are more sensitive to changes in feeds and the presence of mold or other toxins, requiring horses to be fed hay of a more consistent type and quality.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.agry.purdue.edu/Ext/forages/publications/ID-190.htm |title=Selecting Hay for Horses |publisher=Agry.purdue.edu |date=1914-06-30 |accessdate=2012-02-23}}</ref>\n[[File:Hayfield in fall.jpg|thumb|These round bales have been left in the field for many months, perhaps more than a year, exposed to weather, and appear to be rotting.

Thus quantity of hay is important for cattle, who can effectively digest hay of low quality if fed in sufficient amounts. <!--hope that is accurate, fix if it is not--><!-- someone also please add how much hay cattle can eat in a day (i.e. compared to how horses can consume 2.5% of their weight per day)--> Sheep will eat between two and four percent of their body weight per day in dry feed, such as hay,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sheepandgoat.com/articles/feedingsmallruminants.html |last=Schoenian |first=Susan |title=An Introduction to Feeding Small Ruminants |work=Western Maryland Research & Education Center |publisher=Maryland Cooperative Extension Service |accessdate=2007-11-12}}</ref> and are very efficient at obtaining the most nutrition possible from three to five pounds per day of hay or other forage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ext.vt.edu/pubs/sheep/410-853/410-853.html|title=Information on Feeding sheep|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071114183337/http://www.ext.vt.edu/pubs/sheep/410-853/410-853.html|archivedate=2007-11-14}}</ref> They require three to four hours per day to eat enough hay to meet their nutritional requirements.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ag.ansc.purdue.edu/sheep/articles/strchhay.html |author=Mike Neary and Keith Johnson |title=Stretching Hay Supplies |work=Indiana Sheep Tales Vol. 2 |year=1991 |publisher=Purdue University |accessdate=2007-11-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012221311/http://ag.ansc.purdue.edu/sheep/articles/strchhay.html |archivedate=2007-10-12 }}</ref>\n\nUnlike ruminants, horses digest food in small portions throughout the day, and can only use approximately 2.5% of their body weight in feed in any 24-hour period.

Hayfields do not have to be reseeded each year in the way that [[grain]] crops are, but regular fertilizing is usually desirable, and overseeding a field every few years helps increase yield.\n\nMethods and the terminology to describe the steps of making hay have varied greatly throughout history, and many regional variations still exist today. However, whether done by hand or by modern mechanized equipment, tall grass and legumes at the proper stage of maturity must be cut, then allowed to dry (preferably by the sun), then raked into long, narrow piles known as [[windrow]]s. Next, the cured hay is gathered up in some form (usually by some type of baling process) and placed for storage into a haystack or into a [[barn]] or shed to protect it from moisture and rot.\n\nDuring the growing season, which is spring and early summer in [[temperate]] [[climate]]s, grass grows at a fast pace. It is at its greatest nutritive value when all leaves are fully developed and seed or flower heads are just a bit short of full maturity. When growth is at a maximum in the pasture or field, if judged correctly, it is cut. Grass hay cut too early will not cure as easily due to high moisture content, plus it will produce a lower yield per acre than longer, more mature grass. But hay cut too late is coarser, lower in resale value and has lost some of its nutrients. There is usually about a two-week \"window\" of time in which grass is at its ideal stage for harvesting hay. The time for cutting [[alfalfa]] hay is ideally done when plants reach maximum height and are producing flower buds or just beginning to bloom, cutting during or after full bloom results in lower nutritional value of the hay.\n\nHay can be raked into rows as it is cut, then turned periodically to dry, particularly if a modern [[swather]] is used. Or, especially with older equipment or methods, the hay is cut and allowed to lie spread out in the field until it is dry, then raked into rows for processing into bales afterwards. During the drying period, which can take several days, the process is usually sped up by turning the cut hay over with a [[hay rake]] or spreading it out with a [[tedder (machine)|tedder]]. If it rains while the hay is drying, turning the windrow can also allow it to dry faster. However, turning the hay too often or too roughly can also cause drying leaf matter to fall off, reducing the nutrients available to animals. Drying can also be sped up by mechanized processes, such as use of a [[Conditioner (farming)|hay conditioner]], or by use of chemicals sprayed onto the hay to speed [[evaporation]] of moisture, though these are more expensive techniques, not in general use except in areas where there is a combination of modern technology, high prices for hay, and too much rain for hay to dry properly.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=University of Wisconsin-Extension |url=http://www.uwex.edu/ces/forage/wfc/proceedings2003/equipment.htm |author=K.

In some places, depending on geography, region, climate, and culture, hay is gathered loose and stacked without being baled first.\n\nHay must be fully dried when baled and kept dry in storage. If hay is baled while too moist or becomes wet while in storage, there is a significant risk of [[spontaneous combustion]].<ref name=\"CFA\">{{cite web |url=http://www.cfa.vic.gov.au/firesafety/bushfire/documents/Preventing_Haystack_Fires.pdf |title=Preventing Haystack Fires |accessdate=2011-11-10 |date=December 2008 |publisher=Country Fire Authority (CFA) Victoria, Australia |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321132235/http://cfa.vic.gov.au/firesafety/bushfire/documents/Preventing_Haystack_Fires.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-21 }}</ref> Hay stored outside must be stacked in such a way that moisture contact is minimal. Some stacks are arranged in such a manner that the hay itself \"sheds\" water when it falls. Other methods of stacking use the first layers or bales of hay as a cover to protect the rest. To completely keep out moisture, outside haystacks can also be covered by tarps, and many round bales are partially wrapped in plastic as part of the baling process. Hay is also stored under a roof when resources permit. It is frequently placed inside sheds, or stacked inside of a [[barn]]. On the other hand, care must also be taken that hay is never exposed to any possible source of heat or flame, as dry hay and the dust it produces are highly [[flammable]].\n[[File:Breviarium Grimani - Juni detail.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|left|Haymakers, from the ''[[Grimani Breviary]]'', c. 1510.]]\n[[File:Haymaking NLW3364567.jpg|thumb|Haymaking in Wales {{circa|1885}}]]\n[[File:July 1903 - on the Gaisberg, nr Salzburg.JPG|thumb|July 1903 - on the Gaisberg, near Salzburg]]\n[[File:Haying.jpg|thumb|Two men loading hay on a truck in [[Massachusetts]], 1936.]]\n\n===Early methods===\nEarly farmers noticed that growing fields produced more [[fodder]] in the spring than the animals could consume, and that cutting the grass in the summer, allowing it to dry and storing it for the winter provided their [[domestication|domesticated]] animals with better quality nutrition than simply allowing them to dig through snow in the winter to find dried grass. Therefore, some fields were \"shut up\" for hay.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n[[File:190x Hay Harvesting .jpg|thumb|Early 1900s harvesting the hay]]\nUp to the end of the 19th century, grass and legumes were not often grown together because crops were rotated.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} However, by the 20th century, good forage management techniques demonstrated that highly productive pastures were a mix of grasses and legumes, so compromises were made when it was time to mow. Later still, some farmers grew crops, like straight [[alfalfa]] (lucerne), for special-purpose hay such as that fed to [[dairy cattle]].\n\nMuch hay was originally cut by [[scythe]] by teams of workers, dried in the field and gathered loose on [[wagon]]s. Later, haying would be done by horse-drawn implements such as [[mower]]s. With the invention of [[agricultural machinery]] such as the [[tractor]] and the [[baler]], most hay production became [[mechanization|mechanized]] by the 1930s.\n\nAfter hay was cut and had dried, the hay was raked or ''rowed up'' by raking it into a linear heap by hand or with a horse-drawn implement. Turning hay, when needed, originally was done by hand with a fork or rake. Once the dried hay was rowed up, [[pitch fork]]s were used to pile it loose, originally onto a horse-drawn [[cart]] or [[wagon]], later onto a [[truck]] or tractor-drawn trailer, for which a sweep could be used instead of pitch forks.\n[[File:Boerderij Diermenseweg 3 - Putten - 4.jpg|thumb|A [[hay barrack]]. The roof is moved up and down as the hay level changes.]]\n[[File:Hay scow.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.85|Late 19th century hay boat with small square bales]]\nLoose hay was taken to an area designated for storage\u2014usually a slightly raised area for drainage\u2014and built into a hay stack. The stack was made waterproof as it was built (a skilled task) and the hay would compress under its own weight and cure by the release of heat from the residual moisture in the hay and from the compression forces. The stack was fenced from the rest of the paddock in a ''rick yard'', and often thatched or sheeted to keep it dry. When needed, slices of hay would be cut using a [[hay knife]] and fed out to animals each day.\n\nOn some farms the loose hay was stored in a [[hay barrack|barrack]], [[shed]], or [[barn]], normally in such a way that it would compress down and cure. Hay could be stored in a specially designed barn with little internal structure to allow more room for the [[Barn#Uses|hay loft]]. Alternatively, an upper storey of a cow-shed or stable was used, with hatches in the floor to allow hay to be thrown down into hay-racks below.\n\nDepending on region, the term \"hay rick\" could refer to the machine for cutting hay, the hay stack or the wagon used to collect the hay.\n\nHay baling began with the invention of the first [[hay press]] in about 1850.<ref>John T. Schlebecker, \u201cWhereby We Thrive: A History of American Farming, 1607-1972,\u201d [[Iowa State University]] Press, 1975, p 198</ref>   Hay was baled for easier handling and to reduce space required for storage and shipment.  The first bales weighed about 300 lb.  The original machines were of the vertical design similar to the one photographed by [[Greene Co. Historical Society]].  They used a horse driven screw press mechanism or a dropped weight to compress the hay.  The first patent went to HL Emery for a horse powered, screw operated hay press in 1853.  Other models were reported as early as 1843 built by PK Dederick's Sons of [[Albany, NY]], or Samuel Hewitt of [[Switzerland County, Ohio]].<ref>https://www.farmcollector.com/implements/hay-press-zmhz12fzbea</ref>  Later horizontal machines were devised.  One was the \u201cPerpetual Press\u201d made by PK Dederick of [[Albany, NY]], in 1872.  They could be powered by steam engines by about 1882. The continuous hay baler arrived in 1914.\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Modern mechanized techniques==\n[[File:RoundAndSquare.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|left|Different balers can produce hay bales in different sizes and shapes. Here two different balers were used to create both large round bales and small square bales.]]\nModern mechanized hay production today is usually performed by a number of machines. While small operations use a [[tractor]] to pull various implements for mowing and raking, larger operations use specialized machines such as a [[mower]] or a [[swather]], which are designed to cut the hay and arrange it into a windrow in one step. [[Baler]]s are usually pulled by a tractor, with larger balers requiring more powerful tractors.\n\nMobile [[baler]]s, machines which gather and bale hay in one process, were first developed around 1940. The first balers produced rectangular bales small enough for a person to lift, usually between {{convert|70|and|100|lb|kg}} each. The size and shape made it possible for people to pick bales up, stack them on a vehicle for transport to a storage area, then build a haystack by hand. However, to save labor and increase safety, loaders and stackers were also developed to mechanise the transport of small bales from the field to the haystack. Later in the 20th century, balers were developed capable of producing large bales that weigh up to {{convert|3000|lb|kg}}.<ref>{{cite web |first=William G. |last=Hires |title=Large Round Bales: Management |work=Publication no.

The basic idea is that it decreases drying time, particularly in humid climates or if rain interferes with haying. Usually, a salt solution is sprayed over the top of the hay (generally alfalfa) that helps to dry the hay. Conditioning can also refer to the rollers inside a swather that crimps the alfalfa to help squeeze out the moisture.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}\n\n===Fertilization and weed control===\nModern hay production often relies on artificial fertilizer and herbicides. Traditionally, [[manure]] has been used on hayfields, but modern chemical fertilizers are used today as well. Hay that is to be certified as weed-free for use in [[wilderness area]]s must often be sprayed with chemical herbicides to keep unwanted weeds from the field, and sometimes even non-certified hayfields are sprayed to limit the production of [[noxious weed]]s. However, organic forms of fertilization and weed control are required for hay grown for consumption by animals whose meat will ultimately be certified organic. To that end, compost and field rotation can enhance soil fertility, and regular mowing of fields in the growth phase of the hay will often reduce the prevalence of undesired weeds. In recent times, some producers have experimented with human [[sewage sludge]] to grow hay. This is not a certified organic method and no warning labels are mandated by EPA.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ams.usda.gov/AMSv1.0/getfile?dDocName=STELDEV3004446|title=Certified Organic Requirements}}</ref> One concern with hay grown on human sewage sludge is that the hay can take up heavy metals, which are then consumed by animals.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0048-9697(91)90377-Q | pmid=2063180 | volume=100 | title=The behaviour of heavy metals in sewage sludge-amended soils | journal=Science of the Total Environment | pages=151\u2013176| year=1991 | last1=Alloway | first1=Brian J. | last2=Jackson | first2=Andrew P. }}</ref> [[Molybdenum]] poisoning is a particular concern in [[ruminant]]s such as cows and goats, and there have been animal deaths.<ref>{{cite web|title=Molybdenum Poisoning: Introduction|url=http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm/bc/212100.htm}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soil.ncsu.edu/about/century/micronutrient.html|title=Metal uptake by plants|access-date=2013-08-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121122122956/http://www.soil.ncsu.edu/about/century/micronutrient.html|archive-date=2012-11-22|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sludgenews.org/resources/documents/McElmurrayTestimony.pdf|title=Contamination on McElmurray farm from human sewage sludge fertilizer}}</ref> Another concern is with a herbicide known as [[aminopyralid]], which can pass through the digestive tract in animals, making their resulting manure toxic to many plants and thus unsuitable as fertilizer for food crops.<ref>{{cite web|last=Pleasant |first=Barbara |url=http://www.motherearthnews.com/Grow-It/Milestone-Herbicide-Contamination-Creates-Dangerous-Toxic-Compost.aspx |title=Milestone Herbicide Creates Killer Compost |publisher=Motherearthnews.com |date=2009-07-24 |accessdate=2012-02-23}}</ref> Aminopyralid and related herbicides can persist in the environment for several years.\n\n==Baling==\n{{See also|Baler}}\n\n===Small bales===\n[[File:Grass hay by David Shankbone.jpg|right|thumb|When possible, hay, especially small square bales like these, should be stored under cover and protected from [[precipitation]].]]\n\nSmall bales are still produced today. While balers for small bales are still manufactured, as well as loaders and stackers, there are some farms that still use equipment manufactured over 50 years ago, kept in good repair. The small bale remains part of overall [[ranch]] lore and tradition with [[Hay buck|\"hay bucking\"]] competitions still held for fun at many [[rodeo]]s and county [[fair]]s.\n\nSmall square bales are stacked in a criss-crossed fashion sometimes called a \"rick\" or \"hayrick\". Rain tends to wash nutrition out of hay and can cause spoilage or mold. Hay in small square bales is particularly susceptible to this, and is therefore often stored in a hayshed or protected by [[tarpaulin]]s. If this is not done, the top two layers of the stack are often lost to rot and mold, and if the stack is not arranged in a proper hayrick, moisture can seep even deeper into the stack. The rounded shape and tighter compaction of small (and large) round bales makes them less susceptible to spoilage, as the water is less likely to penetrate into the bale. The addition of net wrap, which is not used on square bales, offers even greater weather resistance.\n\nPeople who keep small numbers of animals may prefer small bales that can be handled by one person without machinery. There is also a risk that hay bales may be moldy, or contain decaying carcasses of small creatures that were accidentally killed by baling equipment and swept up into the bale, which can produce toxins such as [[botulinum toxin]]. Both can be deadly to non-[[ruminant]] herbivores, such as [[horse]]s, and when this occurs, the entire contaminated bale generally is thrown out, another reason some people continue to support the market for small bales.\n\n===Large bales===\n[[File:Round bale 3066.jpg|right|thumb|Round bales are harder to handle than square bales but compress the hay more tightly. This round bale is partially covered with net wrap, which is an alternative to [[twine]].]]\nFarmers who need to make large amounts of hay are likely to choose balers which produce much larger bales, maximizing the amount of hay which is protected from the elements. Large bales come in two types, round and square. Large square bales, which can weigh up to {{convert|1000|kg|lb}}, can be stacked and are easier to transport on trucks. Large round bales, which typically weigh {{convert|300|to(-)|400|kg|lb}}, are more moisture-resistant, and pack the hay more densely (especially at the center). Round bales are quickly fed with the use of mechanized equipment.\n\nThe ratio of volume to surface area makes it possible for many dry-area farmers to leave large bales outside until they are consumed. Wet-area farmers and those in climates with heavy snowfall can stack round bales under a shed or tarp, but can also use a light but durable plastic wrap that partially encloses bales left outside. The wrap repels moisture, but leaves the ends of the bale exposed so that the hay itself can \"breathe\" and does not begin to ferment. However, when it is possible to store round bales under a shed, they last longer and less hay is lost to rot and moisture.<ref>{{cite web |first=Edward B. |last=Rayburn |title=Round Bale Storage Costs |publisher=West Virginia University Extension Service |url=http://www.caf.wvu.edu/~forage/roundbale.htm |accessdate=2007-05-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070404143403/http://www.caf.wvu.edu/~forage/roundbale.htm |archivedate=2007-04-04 }}</ref>\n\n===Haylage===\n[[File:Heuballen Plastik Steiermark.jpg|left|thumb|A completely wrapped [[silage]] bale in [[Austria]].]]\nFor animals that eat [[silage]], a [[bale wrapper]] may be used to seal a round bale completely and trigger the fermentation process.

The term \"loose\" means not pressed or baled, but it doesn't necessarily mean a light, fluffy lay of randomly oriented stems. Especially in wet climates, such as those of Britain, the degree of shedding of rainwater by the stack's outer surface is an important factor, and the stacking of loose hay was developed into a skilled-labor task that in its more advanced forms even involved [[thatching]] the top. In many stacking methods (with or without thatched tops), stems were oriented in sheaves, which were laid in oriented sequence.\n\nWith the advent of large bales since the 1960s, today hay is often stored outdoors because the outer surface of the large bale performs the weather-shedding function. The large bales can also be stacked, which allows a given degree of exposed [[surface area]] to count for a larger volume of protected interior hay.

Hazards include the danger of having a poorly constructed stack collapse, causing either falls to people on the stack or injuries to people on the ground who are struck by falling bales. Large round hay bales present a particular danger to those who handle them, because they can weigh over {{convert|1000|lb}} and cannot be moved without special equipment. Nonetheless, because they are cylindrical in shape, and thus can roll easily, it is not uncommon for them to fall from stacks or roll off the equipment used to handle them.

However, it is also fed to smaller domesticated animals such as [[Domestic rabbit|rabbits]] and [[guinea pig]]s. [[Domestic pig|Pigs]] may also be fed hay, but they do not [[Digestion|digest]] it as efficiently as [[herbivore]]s.\n\nHay can be used as animal [[fodder]] when or where there is not enough [[pasture]] or [[rangeland]] on which to [[Grazing|graze]] an animal, when grazing is not feasible due to weather (such as during the winter), or when lush pasture by itself would be too rich for the health of the animal. It is also fed when an animal is unable to access pasture, e.g. the animal is being kept in a [[stable]] or [[barn]].\n\n==Composition==\nCommonly used plants for hay include mixtures of [[pasture|grasses]] such as [[ryegrass]] (''Lolium'' species), [[Timothy-grass|timothy]], [[Bromus|brome]], [[fescue]], [[Cynodon|Bermuda grass]], [[orchard grass]], and other species, depending on region. Hay may also include [[legume]]s, such as [[alfalfa]] (lucerne) and [[clover]]s ([[Trifolium pratense|red]], [[Trifolium repens|white]] and [[Subterranean clover|subterranean]]). Legumes in hay are ideally cut pre-bloom. Other pasture [[forb]]s are also sometimes a part of the mix, though these plants are not necessarily desired as certain forbs are toxic to some animals.\n\n[[Oat]], [[barley]], and [[wheat]] plant materials are occasionally cut green and made into hay for animal [[fodder]]; however they are more usually used in the form of [[straw]], a harvest byproduct where the stems and dead leaves are baled after the grain has been harvested and [[Threshing|threshed]]. Straw is used mainly for animal bedding. Although straw is also used as fodder, particularly as a source of [[dietary fiber]], it has lower nutritional value than hay.\n\nIt is the leaf and seed material in the hay that determines its quality, because they contain more of the [[nutrition]] value for the animal than the stems do.<ref name=\"Deere-1957\">{{Citation |author=Deere and Company |authorlink=John Deere |year=1957 |title=The Operation, Care, and Repair of Farm Machinery |edition=28th |chapter=23: Hay conditioners |publisher=Deere and Company |location=Moline, Illinois, USA |oclc=965865819 |asin=B000FNB7WM |postscript=.}}</ref>{{rp|194}} Farmers try to harvest hay at the point when the seed heads are not quite ripe and the leaf is at its maximum when the grass is mowed in the field. The cut material is allowed to dry so that the bulk of the moisture is removed but the leafy material is still robust enough to be picked up from the ground by machinery and processed into storage in bales, stacks or pits. Methods of haymaking thus aim to minimize the shattering and falling away of the leaves during handling.<ref name=\"Deere-1957\"/>{{rp|194}} \n[[File:GrassHay1.jpg|thumb|left|upright|1.5|Close view of loose grass hay.<!--fluffed out from a newly-opened bale-->]]\n\n{{Anchor|Weather, especially at harvesting}}\nHay is very sensitive to weather conditions, especially when it is harvested. In drought conditions, both seed and leaf production are stunted, making hay that has a high ratio of dry coarse stems that have very low nutritional values. If the weather is too wet, the cut hay may spoil in the field before it can be baled. Thus the biggest challenge and risk for farmers in producing hay crops is the weather, especially the weather of the particular few weeks when the plants are at the best age/maturity for hay. A lucky break in the weather often moves the haymaking tasks (such as mowing, tedding, and baling) to the top priority on the farm's to-do list. This is reflected in the [[idiom]] ''to [[wikt:make hay while the sun shines|make hay while the sun shines]]''. Hay that was too wet at cutting may develop rot and mold after being baled, creating the potential for toxins to form in the feed, which could make the animals sick.\n\nAfter harvest, hay also has to be stored in a manner to prevent it from getting wet. Mold and spoilage reduce nutritional value and may cause illness in animals.  A [[symbiotic]] fungus in [[fescue]] may cause illness in horses and cattle.<ref>{{Citation|url=http://www.uaex.edu/Other_Areas/publications/PDF/FSA-3042.pdf\n|publisher=[[University of Arkansas]] Division of Agriculture |title=Managing Fescue for Horses FSA3042 |quote=Cattle grazing fescue often develop a chronic, unthrifty condition, especially apparent during the summer months.

Sometimes, hay stored outdoors will look like this on the outside but still be green inside the bale. A dried, bleached or coarse bale is still edible and provides some nutritional value as long as it is dry and not moldy, dusty, or rotting.]]\n\nThe successful harvest of maximum yields of high-quality hay is entirely dependent on the coincident occurrence of optimum crop, field, and weather conditions. When this occurs, there may be a period of intense activity on the hay farm while harvest proceeds until weather conditions become unfavourable.\n\n==Feeding hay==\n[[File:Freshly cut hay in alpine meadows in the mountainous region of Buryatia.jpg|thumb|Freshly cut hay in alpine meadows in the mountainous region of Buryatia]]\n{{Main|Equine nutrition|Cattle feeding|Sheep husbandry}}\n{{See also|Fodder|Ruminant|Cecum}}\nHay or grass is the foundation of the diet for all grazing animals and can provide as much as 100% of the [[fodder]] required for an animal. Hay is usually fed to an animal in place of allowing the animal to graze on grasses in a [[pasture]], particularly in the winter or during times when drought or other conditions make pasture unavailable. Animals that can eat hay vary in the types of grasses suitable for consumption, the ways they consume hay, and how they digest it. Therefore, different types of animals require hay that consists of similar plants to what they would eat while grazing, and likewise, plants that are toxic to an animal in pasture are also toxic if they are dried into hay.\n[[File:HorsesAndHay.jpg|left|thumb|upright=1.10|Horses eating hay]]\n\nMost animals are fed hay in two daily feedings, morning and evening. However, this schedule is more for the convenience of humans, as most grazing animals on pasture naturally consume [[fodder]] in multiple feedings throughout the day. Some animals, especially those being raised for meat, may be given enough hay that they simply are able to eat all day. Other animals, especially those that are ridden or driven as [[working animal]]s, are only free to eat when not working, and may be given a more limited amount of hay to prevent them from getting too fat. The proper amount of hay and the type of hay required varies somewhat between different species. <!-- and is too complex to fully explain here, hence the \"main\" tags, add more if needed--> Some animals are also fed concentrated feeds such as [[grain]] or vitamin supplements in addition to hay. In most cases, hay or pasture [[forage]] must make up 50% or more of the diet by weight.\n\nOne of the most significant differences in hay digestion is between [[ruminant]] animals, such as [[cattle]] and [[sheep]]; and nonruminant, [[hindgut fermentation|hindgut fermentors]], such as [[horse]]s. Both types of animals can digest [[cellulose]] in grass and hay, but do so by different mechanisms. Because of the four-chambered stomach of cattle, they are often able to break down older forage and have more tolerance of mold and changes in diet. <!--please verify this statement, I am over-generalizing, I know--> The single-chambered stomach and [[cecum]] or \"hindgut\" of the horse uses bacterial processes to break down cellulose that are more sensitive to changes in feeds and the presence of mold or other toxins, requiring horses to be fed hay of a more consistent type and quality.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.agry.purdue.edu/Ext/forages/publications/ID-190.htm |title=Selecting Hay for Horses |publisher=Agry.purdue.edu |date=1914-06-30 |accessdate=2012-02-23}}</ref>\n[[File:Hayfield in fall.jpg|thumb|These round bales have been left in the field for many months, perhaps more than a year, exposed to weather, and appear to be rotting.

Thus quantity of hay is important for cattle, who can effectively digest hay of low quality if fed in sufficient amounts. <!--hope that is accurate, fix if it is not--><!-- someone also please add how much hay cattle can eat in a day (i.e. compared to how horses can consume 2.5% of their weight per day)--> Sheep will eat between two and four percent of their body weight per day in dry feed, such as hay,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sheepandgoat.com/articles/feedingsmallruminants.html |last=Schoenian |first=Susan |title=An Introduction to Feeding Small Ruminants |work=Western Maryland Research & Education Center |publisher=Maryland Cooperative Extension Service |accessdate=2007-11-12}}</ref> and are very efficient at obtaining the most nutrition possible from three to five pounds per day of hay or other forage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ext.vt.edu/pubs/sheep/410-853/410-853.html|title=Information on Feeding sheep|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071114183337/http://www.ext.vt.edu/pubs/sheep/410-853/410-853.html|archivedate=2007-11-14}}</ref> They require three to four hours per day to eat enough hay to meet their nutritional requirements.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ag.ansc.purdue.edu/sheep/articles/strchhay.html |author=Mike Neary and Keith Johnson |title=Stretching Hay Supplies |work=Indiana Sheep Tales Vol. 2 |year=1991 |publisher=Purdue University |accessdate=2007-11-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012221311/http://ag.ansc.purdue.edu/sheep/articles/strchhay.html |archivedate=2007-10-12 }}</ref>\n\nUnlike ruminants, horses digest food in small portions throughout the day, and can only use approximately 2.5% of their body weight in feed in any 24-hour period.

Hayfields do not have to be reseeded each year in the way that [[grain]] crops are, but regular fertilizing is usually desirable, and overseeding a field every few years helps increase yield.\n\nMethods and the terminology to describe the steps of making hay have varied greatly throughout history, and many regional variations still exist today. However, whether done by hand or by modern mechanized equipment, tall grass and legumes at the proper stage of maturity must be cut, then allowed to dry (preferably by the sun), then raked into long, narrow piles known as [[windrow]]s. Next, the cured hay is gathered up in some form (usually by some type of baling process) and placed for storage into a haystack or into a [[barn]] or shed to protect it from moisture and rot.\n\nDuring the growing season, which is spring and early summer in [[temperate]] [[climate]]s, grass grows at a fast pace. It is at its greatest nutritive value when all leaves are fully developed and seed or flower heads are just a bit short of full maturity. When growth is at a maximum in the pasture or field, if judged correctly, it is cut. Grass hay cut too early will not cure as easily due to high moisture content, plus it will produce a lower yield per acre than longer, more mature grass. But hay cut too late is coarser, lower in resale value and has lost some of its nutrients. There is usually about a two-week \"window\" of time in which grass is at its ideal stage for harvesting hay. The time for cutting [[alfalfa]] hay is ideally done when plants reach maximum height and are producing flower buds or just beginning to bloom, cutting during or after full bloom results in lower nutritional value of the hay.\n\nHay can be raked into rows as it is cut, then turned periodically to dry, particularly if a modern [[swather]] is used. Or, especially with older equipment or methods, the hay is cut and allowed to lie spread out in the field until it is dry, then raked into rows for processing into bales afterwards. During the drying period, which can take several days, the process is usually sped up by turning the cut hay over with a [[hay rake]] or spreading it out with a [[tedder (machine)|tedder]]. If it rains while the hay is drying, turning the windrow can also allow it to dry faster. However, turning the hay too often or too roughly can also cause drying leaf matter to fall off, reducing the nutrients available to animals. Drying can also be sped up by mechanized processes, such as use of a [[Conditioner (farming)|hay conditioner]], or by use of chemicals sprayed onto the hay to speed [[evaporation]] of moisture, though these are more expensive techniques, not in general use except in areas where there is a combination of modern technology, high prices for hay, and too much rain for hay to dry properly.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=University of Wisconsin-Extension |url=http://www.uwex.edu/ces/forage/wfc/proceedings2003/equipment.htm |author=K.

In some places, depending on geography, region, climate, and culture, hay is gathered loose and stacked without being baled first.\n\nHay must be fully dried when baled and kept dry in storage. If hay is baled while too moist or becomes wet while in storage, there is a significant risk of [[spontaneous combustion]].<ref name=\"CFA\">{{cite web |url=http://www.cfa.vic.gov.au/firesafety/bushfire/documents/Preventing_Haystack_Fires.pdf |title=Preventing Haystack Fires |accessdate=2011-11-10 |date=December 2008 |publisher=Country Fire Authority (CFA) Victoria, Australia |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321132235/http://cfa.vic.gov.au/firesafety/bushfire/documents/Preventing_Haystack_Fires.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-21 }}</ref> Hay stored outside must be stacked in such a way that moisture contact is minimal. Some stacks are arranged in such a manner that the hay itself \"sheds\" water when it falls. Other methods of stacking use the first layers or bales of hay as a cover to protect the rest. To completely keep out moisture, outside haystacks can also be covered by tarps, and many round bales are partially wrapped in plastic as part of the baling process. Hay is also stored under a roof when resources permit. It is frequently placed inside sheds, or stacked inside of a [[barn]]. On the other hand, care must also be taken that hay is never exposed to any possible source of heat or flame, as dry hay and the dust it produces are highly [[flammable]].\n[[File:Breviarium Grimani - Juni detail.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|left|Haymakers, from the ''[[Grimani Breviary]]'', c. 1510.]]\n[[File:Haymaking NLW3364567.jpg|thumb|Haymaking in Wales {{circa|1885}}]]\n[[File:July 1903 - on the Gaisberg, nr Salzburg.JPG|thumb|July 1903 - on the Gaisberg, near Salzburg]]\n[[File:Haying.jpg|thumb|Two men loading hay on a truck in [[Massachusetts]], 1936.]]\n\n===Early methods===\nEarly farmers noticed that growing fields produced more [[fodder]] in the spring than the animals could consume, and that cutting the grass in the summer, allowing it to dry and storing it for the winter provided their [[domestication|domesticated]] animals with better quality nutrition than simply allowing them to dig through snow in the winter to find dried grass. Therefore, some fields were \"shut up\" for hay.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n[[File:190x Hay Harvesting .jpg|thumb|Early 1900s harvesting the hay]]\nUp to the end of the 19th century, grass and legumes were not often grown together because crops were rotated.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} However, by the 20th century, good forage management techniques demonstrated that highly productive pastures were a mix of grasses and legumes, so compromises were made when it was time to mow. Later still, some farmers grew crops, like straight [[alfalfa]] (lucerne), for special-purpose hay such as that fed to [[dairy cattle]].\n\nMuch hay was originally cut by [[scythe]] by teams of workers, dried in the field and gathered loose on [[wagon]]s. Later, haying would be done by horse-drawn implements such as [[mower]]s. With the invention of [[agricultural machinery]] such as the [[tractor]] and the [[baler]], most hay production became [[mechanization|mechanized]] by the 1930s.\n\nAfter hay was cut and had dried, the hay was raked or ''rowed up'' by raking it into a linear heap by hand or with a horse-drawn implement. Turning hay, when needed, originally was done by hand with a fork or rake. Once the dried hay was rowed up, [[pitch fork]]s were used to pile it loose, originally onto a horse-drawn [[cart]] or [[wagon]], later onto a [[truck]] or tractor-drawn trailer, for which a sweep could be used instead of pitch forks.\n[[File:Boerderij Diermenseweg 3 - Putten - 4.jpg|thumb|A [[hay barrack]]. The roof is moved up and down as the hay level changes.]]\n[[File:Hay scow.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.85|Late 19th century hay boat with small square bales]]\nLoose hay was taken to an area designated for storage\u2014usually a slightly raised area for drainage\u2014and built into a hay stack. The stack was made waterproof as it was built (a skilled task) and the hay would compress under its own weight and cure by the release of heat from the residual moisture in the hay and from the compression forces. The stack was fenced from the rest of the paddock in a ''rick yard'', and often thatched or sheeted to keep it dry. When needed, slices of hay would be cut using a [[hay knife]] and fed out to animals each day.\n\nOn some farms the loose hay was stored in a [[hay barrack|barrack]], [[shed]], or [[barn]], normally in such a way that it would compress down and cure. Hay could be stored in a specially designed barn with little internal structure to allow more room for the [[Barn#Uses|hay loft]]. Alternatively, an upper storey of a cow-shed or stable was used, with hatches in the floor to allow hay to be thrown down into hay-racks below.\n\nDepending on region, the term \"hay rick\" could refer to the machine for cutting hay, the hay stack or the wagon used to collect the hay.\n\nHay baling began with the invention of the first [[hay press]] in about 1850.<ref>John T. Schlebecker, \u201cWhereby We Thrive: A History of American Farming, 1607-1972,\u201d [[Iowa State University]] Press, 1975, p 198</ref>   Hay was baled for easier handling and to reduce space required for storage and shipment.  The first bales weighed about 300 lb.  The original machines were of the vertical design similar to the one photographed by [[Greene Co. Historical Society]].  They used a horse driven screw press mechanism or a dropped weight to compress the hay.  The first patent went to HL Emery for a horse powered, screw operated hay press in 1853.  Other models were reported as early as 1843 built by PK Dederick's Sons of [[Albany, NY]], or Samuel Hewitt of [[Switzerland County, Ohio]].<ref>https://www.farmcollector.com/implements/hay-press-zmhz12fzbea</ref>  Later horizontal machines were devised.  One was the \u201cPerpetual Press\u201d made by PK Dederick of [[Albany, NY]], in 1872.  They could be powered by steam engines by about 1882. The continuous hay baler arrived in 1914.\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Modern mechanized techniques==\n[[File:RoundAndSquare.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|left|Different balers can produce hay bales in different sizes and shapes. Here two different balers were used to create both large round bales and small square bales.]]\nModern mechanized hay production today is usually performed by a number of machines. While small operations use a [[tractor]] to pull various implements for mowing and raking, larger operations use specialized machines such as a [[mower]] or a [[swather]], which are designed to cut the hay and arrange it into a windrow in one step. [[Baler]]s are usually pulled by a tractor, with larger balers requiring more powerful tractors.\n\nMobile [[baler]]s, machines which gather and bale hay in one process, were first developed around 1940. The first balers produced rectangular bales small enough for a person to lift, usually between {{convert|70|and|100|lb|kg}} each. The size and shape made it possible for people to pick bales up, stack them on a vehicle for transport to a storage area, then build a haystack by hand. However, to save labor and increase safety, loaders and stackers were also developed to mechanise the transport of small bales from the field to the haystack. Later in the 20th century, balers were developed capable of producing large bales that weigh up to {{convert|3000|lb|kg}}.<ref>{{cite web |first=William G. |last=Hires |title=Large Round Bales: Management |work=Publication no.

The basic idea is that it decreases drying time, particularly in humid climates or if rain interferes with haying. Usually, a salt solution is sprayed over the top of the hay (generally alfalfa) that helps to dry the hay. Conditioning can also refer to the rollers inside a swather that crimps the alfalfa to help squeeze out the moisture.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}\n\n===Fertilization and weed control===\nModern hay production often relies on artificial fertilizer and herbicides. Traditionally, [[manure]] has been used on hayfields, but modern chemical fertilizers are used today as well. Hay that is to be certified as weed-free for use in [[wilderness area]]s must often be sprayed with chemical herbicides to keep unwanted weeds from the field, and sometimes even non-certified hayfields are sprayed to limit the production of [[noxious weed]]s. However, organic forms of fertilization and weed control are required for hay grown for consumption by animals whose meat will ultimately be certified organic. To that end, compost and field rotation can enhance soil fertility, and regular mowing of fields in the growth phase of the hay will often reduce the prevalence of undesired weeds. In recent times, some producers have experimented with human [[sewage sludge]] to grow hay. This is not a certified organic method and no warning labels are mandated by EPA.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ams.usda.gov/AMSv1.0/getfile?dDocName=STELDEV3004446|title=Certified Organic Requirements}}</ref> One concern with hay grown on human sewage sludge is that the hay can take up heavy metals, which are then consumed by animals.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0048-9697(91)90377-Q | pmid=2063180 | volume=100 | title=The behaviour of heavy metals in sewage sludge-amended soils | journal=Science of the Total Environment | pages=151\u2013176| year=1991 | last1=Alloway | first1=Brian J. | last2=Jackson | first2=Andrew P. }}</ref> [[Molybdenum]] poisoning is a particular concern in [[ruminant]]s such as cows and goats, and there have been animal deaths.<ref>{{cite web|title=Molybdenum Poisoning: Introduction|url=http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm/bc/212100.htm}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soil.ncsu.edu/about/century/micronutrient.html|title=Metal uptake by plants|access-date=2013-08-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121122122956/http://www.soil.ncsu.edu/about/century/micronutrient.html|archive-date=2012-11-22|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sludgenews.org/resources/documents/McElmurrayTestimony.pdf|title=Contamination on McElmurray farm from human sewage sludge fertilizer}}</ref> Another concern is with a herbicide known as [[aminopyralid]], which can pass through the digestive tract in animals, making their resulting manure toxic to many plants and thus unsuitable as fertilizer for food crops.<ref>{{cite web|last=Pleasant |first=Barbara |url=http://www.motherearthnews.com/Grow-It/Milestone-Herbicide-Contamination-Creates-Dangerous-Toxic-Compost.aspx |title=Milestone Herbicide Creates Killer Compost |publisher=Motherearthnews.com |date=2009-07-24 |accessdate=2012-02-23}}</ref> Aminopyralid and related herbicides can persist in the environment for several years.\n\n==Baling==\n{{See also|Baler}}\n\n===Small bales===\n[[File:Grass hay by David Shankbone.jpg|right|thumb|When possible, hay, especially small square bales like these, should be stored under cover and protected from [[precipitation]].]]\n\nSmall bales are still produced today. While balers for small bales are still manufactured, as well as loaders and stackers, there are some farms that still use equipment manufactured over 50 years ago, kept in good repair. The small bale remains part of overall [[ranch]] lore and tradition with [[Hay buck|\"hay bucking\"]] competitions still held for fun at many [[rodeo]]s and county [[fair]]s.\n\nSmall square bales are stacked in a criss-crossed fashion sometimes called a \"rick\" or \"hayrick\". Rain tends to wash nutrition out of hay and can cause spoilage or mold. Hay in small square bales is particularly susceptible to this, and is therefore often stored in a hayshed or protected by [[tarpaulin]]s. If this is not done, the top two layers of the stack are often lost to rot and mold, and if the stack is not arranged in a proper hayrick, moisture can seep even deeper into the stack. The rounded shape and tighter compaction of small (and large) round bales makes them less susceptible to spoilage, as the water is less likely to penetrate into the bale. The addition of net wrap, which is not used on square bales, offers even greater weather resistance.\n\nPeople who keep small numbers of animals may prefer small bales that can be handled by one person without machinery. There is also a risk that hay bales may be moldy, or contain decaying carcasses of small creatures that were accidentally killed by baling equipment and swept up into the bale, which can produce toxins such as [[botulinum toxin]]. Both can be deadly to non-[[ruminant]] herbivores, such as [[horse]]s, and when this occurs, the entire contaminated bale generally is thrown out, another reason some people continue to support the market for small bales.\n\n===Large bales===\n[[File:Round bale 3066.jpg|right|thumb|Round bales are harder to handle than square bales but compress the hay more tightly. This round bale is partially covered with net wrap, which is an alternative to [[twine]].]]\nFarmers who need to make large amounts of hay are likely to choose balers which produce much larger bales, maximizing the amount of hay which is protected from the elements. Large bales come in two types, round and square. Large square bales, which can weigh up to {{convert|1000|kg|lb}}, can be stacked and are easier to transport on trucks. Large round bales, which typically weigh {{convert|300|to(-)|400|kg|lb}}, are more moisture-resistant, and pack the hay more densely (especially at the center). Round bales are quickly fed with the use of mechanized equipment.\n\nThe ratio of volume to surface area makes it possible for many dry-area farmers to leave large bales outside until they are consumed. Wet-area farmers and those in climates with heavy snowfall can stack round bales under a shed or tarp, but can also use a light but durable plastic wrap that partially encloses bales left outside. The wrap repels moisture, but leaves the ends of the bale exposed so that the hay itself can \"breathe\" and does not begin to ferment. However, when it is possible to store round bales under a shed, they last longer and less hay is lost to rot and moisture.<ref>{{cite web |first=Edward B. |last=Rayburn |title=Round Bale Storage Costs |publisher=West Virginia University Extension Service |url=http://www.caf.wvu.edu/~forage/roundbale.htm |accessdate=2007-05-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070404143403/http://www.caf.wvu.edu/~forage/roundbale.htm |archivedate=2007-04-04 }}</ref>\n\n===Haylage===\n[[File:Heuballen Plastik Steiermark.jpg|left|thumb|A completely wrapped [[silage]] bale in [[Austria]].]]\nFor animals that eat [[silage]], a [[bale wrapper]] may be used to seal a round bale completely and trigger the fermentation process.

The term \"loose\" means not pressed or baled, but it doesn't necessarily mean a light, fluffy lay of randomly oriented stems. Especially in wet climates, such as those of Britain, the degree of shedding of rainwater by the stack's outer surface is an important factor, and the stacking of loose hay was developed into a skilled-labor task that in its more advanced forms even involved [[thatching]] the top. In many stacking methods (with or without thatched tops), stems were oriented in sheaves, which were laid in oriented sequence.\n\nWith the advent of large bales since the 1960s, today hay is often stored outdoors because the outer surface of the large bale performs the weather-shedding function. The large bales can also be stacked, which allows a given degree of exposed [[surface area]] to count for a larger volume of protected interior hay. Plastic [[tarpaulin]]s are sometimes used to shed the rain, with a goal of reduced hay wastage, but the cost of the tarpaulins must be weighed against the cost of the hay spoilage percentage difference; it may not be worth the cost, or the plastic's environmental footprint.\n\nAfter World War II, British farmers found that the [[supply and demand|demand outstripped supply]] for skilled farm laborers experienced in the thatching of haystacks.<ref name=\"Henderson-1944\">{{Citation |last=Henderson |first=George |year=2013 |orig-year=1944 |title=The Farming Ladder |edition=Kindle |url= |isbn= |oclc= |asin=B0090KZEA2 |postscript=.}}</ref> This no doubt contributed to the pressure for baling in large bales to increasingly replace stacking, which was happening anyway as haymaking technology (like other farm technology) continued toward extensive mechanization with one-man operation of many tasks.

Haystacks produce internal heat due to bacterial fermentation. If hay is stacked with wet grass, the heat produced can be sufficient to ignite the hay causing a fire.

Hay is considered fully dry when it reaches 20% moisture. Combustion problems typically occur within five days to seven days of baling. A bale cooler than {{convert|120|F|C}} is in little danger, but bales between {{convert|120|and|140|F|C}} need to be removed from a barn or structure and separated so that they can cool off.

Hazards include the danger of having a poorly constructed stack collapse, causing either falls to people on the stack or injuries to people on the ground who are struck by falling bales. Large round hay bales present a particular danger to those who handle them, because they can weigh over {{convert|1000|lb}} and cannot be moved without special equipment. Nonetheless, because they are cylindrical in shape, and thus can roll easily, it is not uncommon for them to fall from stacks or roll off the equipment used to handle them.  From 1992 to 1998, 74 farm workers in the [[United States]] were killed in large round hay bale accidents, usually when bales were being moved from one location to another, such as when feeding animals.<ref name=\"danger\">{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2001-146/|title=Hazards Associated with Using Farm Tractors to Move Large Bales|accessdate=September 10, 2004}}</ref><ref name=\"Minnesota\">{{cite web|url=http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/279/9/647|title=JAMA - Fatalities Associated With Large Round Hay Bales\u2014Minnesota, 1994-1996|accessdate=September 10, 2004}}</ref>\n\nHay is generally one of the safest feeds to provide to [[domesticated]] grazing [[herbivore]]s. However, some precautions are needed. Amount must be monitored so that animals do not get too fat or too thin. Supplemental feed may be required for [[working animal]]s with high energy requirements. Animals who eat spoiled hay may develop a variety of illnesses, from coughs related to dust and [[mold]], to various other illnesses, the most serious of which may be [[botulism]], which can occur if a small animal, such as a rodent or snake, is killed by the baling equipment, then rots inside the bale, causing a toxin to form. Some animals are sensitive to particular [[fungi]] or molds that may grow on living plants. For example, an [[endophytic]] [[fungus]] that sometimes grows on [[fescue]] can cause [[abortion]] in pregnant [[mare (horse)|mares]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.omafra.gov.on.ca/english/livestock/horses/facts/05-061.htm|title=Abortion in Horses|last1=Wright|first1=Bob|last2=Kenney|first2=Dan|publisher=Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food, and Rural Affairs}}<!--Fact Sheet no. 05-061--></ref> Some plants themselves may also be toxic to some animals.

It honored musical achievement of 2007 in which albums were released between October 1, 2006 through September 30, 2007. The primary ceremonies were televised in the US on [[CBS]]; however, as has become the custom, most of the awards were handed out during a pre-telecast portion of the show held at the [[Los Angeles Convention Center]] and broadcast on [[XM Satellite Radio]]. Two nights prior to the show [[Aretha Franklin]] was honored as the [[MusiCares]] Person of the Year.\n\nThe year's big winner was [[Amy Winehouse]]: the 24-year-old singer had recently entered a [[drug rehabilitation]] program and did not come to Los Angeles. American officials initially refused her a work visa; they reversed the decision, but by then it was too late for her to make the trip from the UK.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/09/arts/09arts-ALLOWEDINWIN_BRF.html|title=Allowed In, Winehouse Chooses to Stay Home|first=Jeff|last=Leeds|date=9 February 2008|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=1 August 2017}}</ref>  She became the fifth female solo artist to get five awards in one night, alongside [[Lauryn Hill]], [[Norah Jones]], [[Alicia Keys]], [[Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles|Beyonc\u00e9]] and [[ Billie Eilish]].\n\nThe golden anniversary of the Grammys and NARAS was noted in references and performances throughout this year's ceremony. [[Alicia Keys]] was the evening's opening musician, singing and playing piano alongside archived video and audio of [[Frank Sinatra]].

One of the trustees asked Ford Foundation Vice President Mitchell Sviridoff \"what he would do if he had $25 million to spend on helping declining cities.\" Sviridoff responded that he would \"identify competent leaders in 50 to 100 communities around the nation and give them as much money and support as possible.\" <ref name=\"Teltsch\">{{cite news|last=Teltsch|first=Kathleen|title=Funds Are Packaged to Aid Communities|newspaper=New York Times|date=July 6, 1981}}</ref> Sviridoff went on to become LISC's first president. [[Robert D. Lilley (businessman)|Robert D. Lilley]], a former president of [[AT&T]], was chosen to be the first chair of LISC\u2019s board.\n\nLISC was founded in December 1979 and formally announced in May 1980, with $10 million in capital from the Ford Foundation, [[Aetna]], Continental Illinois Bank, [[International Harvester]], [[Levi Strauss & Co.]], and [[Prudential Insurance]].<ref>{{cite news| title=Contl. Illinois is Among Sponsors of Community Development Aid Panel|newspaper=The American Banker|date=May 23, 1980}}</ref>  LISC made its first loans and grants to 27 community organizations in December 1980.

In addition to banks and foundations, LISC began raising capital from private corporations like [[Macy\u2019s]], [[CBS]], [[Metlife]], and [[Time, Inc]]. LISC\u2019s investments in the Bronx helped stabilize the borough after the \u201c[[Bronx is burning]]\u201d era of the 1970s.

In the view of some analysts, the relatively conservative [[government-sponsored enterprise]]s (GSEs) policed mortgage originators and maintained relatively high underwriting standards prior to 2003. However, as market power shifted from securitizers to originators and as intense competition from private securitizers undermined GSE power, mortgage standards declined and risky loans proliferated.

This pool of money had roughly doubled in size from 2000 to 2007, yet the supply of relatively safe, income generating investments had not grown as fast.

Financing these deficits required the country to borrow large sums from abroad, much of it from countries running trade surpluses. These were mainly the emerging economies in Asia and oil-exporting nations. The [[balance of payments]] [[identity (mathematics)|identity]] requires that a country (such as the US) running a [[Current account (balance of payments)|current account]] deficit also have a [[capital account]] (investment) surplus of the same amount. Hence large and growing amounts of foreign funds (capital) flowed into the US to finance its imports.\n\nAll of this created demand for various types of financial assets, raising the prices of those assets while lowering interest rates. Foreign investors had these funds to lend either because they had very high personal savings rates (as high as 40% in China) or because of high oil prices.

Too many consumers attempting to save (or pay down debt) simultaneously is called the [[paradox of thrift]] and can cause or deepen a recession. Economist [[Hyman Minsky]] also described a \"paradox of deleveraging\" as financial institutions that have too much leverage (debt relative to equity) cannot all de-leverage simultaneously without significant declines in the value of their assets.<ref name=\"Yellen on Minsky\" />\n\nIn April 2009, US Federal Reserve vice-chair [[Janet Yellen]] discussed these paradoxes:\n\n<blockquote>Once this massive credit crunch hit, it didn't take long before we were in a recession. The recession, in turn, deepened the credit crunch as demand and employment fell, and credit losses of financial institutions surged. Indeed, we have been in the grips of precisely this adverse feedback loop for more than a year. A process of balance sheet deleveraging has spread to nearly every corner of the economy. Consumers are pulling back on purchases, especially on durable goods, to build their savings. Businesses are cancelling planned investments and laying off workers to preserve cash. And, financial institutions are shrinking assets to bolster capital and improve their chances of weathering the current storm. Once again, Minsky understood this dynamic. He spoke of the paradox of deleveraging, in which precautions that may be smart for individuals and firms\u2014and indeed essential to return the economy to a normal state\u2014nevertheless magnify the distress of the economy as a whole.<ref name=\"Yellen on Minsky\" /></blockquote>\n\n===Financial innovation and complexity===\n[[File:CDO - FCIC and IMF Diagram.png|thumb|upright=1.35|right|IMF Diagram of CDO and RMBS]]\nThe term [[financial innovation]] refers to the ongoing development of financial products designed to achieve particular client objectives, such as offsetting a particular risk exposure (such as the default of a borrower) or to assist with obtaining financing. Examples pertinent to this crisis included: the [[adjustable-rate mortgage]]; the bundling of subprime mortgages into [[Mortgage-backed security|mortgage-backed securities]] (MBS) or [[collateralized debt obligation]]s (CDO) for sale to investors, a type of [[securitization]]; and a form of credit insurance called credit default swaps (CDS). The usage of these products expanded dramatically in the years leading up to the crisis. These products vary in complexity and the ease with which they can be valued on the books of financial institutions.{{Citation needed|reason=No source|date=September 2019}}\n\nCDO issuance grew from an estimated $20 billion in Q1 2004 to its peak of over $180 billion by Q1 2007, then declined back under $20 billion by Q1 2008. Further, the credit quality of CDO's declined from 2000 to 2007, as the level of subprime and other non-prime mortgage debt increased from 5% to 36% of CDO assets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hks.harvard.edu/m-rcbg/students/dunlop/2009-CDOmeltdown.pdf|title=2010 CDO Thesis|accessdate=April 22, 2011}}</ref> As described in the section on subprime lending, the CDS and portfolio of CDS called [[synthetic CDO]] enabled a theoretically infinite amount to be wagered on the finite value of housing loans outstanding, provided that buyers and sellers of the derivatives could be found.

It multiplied the number of actors connected to a single mortgage (including mortgage brokers, specialized originators, the securitizers and their due diligence firms, managing agents and trading desks, and finally investors, insurances and providers of repo funding). With increasing distance from the underlying asset these actors relied more and more on indirect information (including FICO scores on creditworthiness, appraisals and due diligence checks by third party organizations, and most importantly the computer models of rating agencies and risk management desks). Instead of spreading risk this provided the ground for fraudulent acts, misjudgments and finally market collapse.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fcic.law.stanford.edu/resource/staff-data-projects/story-of-a-security|title=Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission \u2013 story of a security|accessdate=June 6, 2011}}</ref>\n\n[[Martin Wolf]] further wrote in June 2009 that certain financial innovations enabled firms to circumvent regulations, such as off-balance sheet financing that affects the leverage or capital cushion reported by major banks, stating: \"... an enormous part of what banks did in the early part of this decade\u2014the off-balance-sheet vehicles, the derivatives and the 'shadow banking system' itself\u2014was to find a way round regulation.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/095722f6-6028-11de-a09b-00144feabdc0.html|title=FT Martin Wolf \u2013 Reform of Regulation and Incentives|work=Financial Times|date=June 23, 2009|accessdate=May 1, 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Incorrect pricing of risk===\n[[File:AIG Protester on Pine Street.jpg|thumb|A protester on [[Wall Street]] in the wake of the [[AIG bonus payments controversy]] is interviewed by news media.]]\n\nMortgage risks were underestimated by almost all institutions in the chain from originator to investor by underweighting the possibility of falling housing prices based on historical trends of the past 50 years.

Several scholars have argued that a lack of transparency about banks' risk exposures prevented markets from correctly pricing risk before the crisis, enabled the mortgage market to grow larger than it otherwise would have, and made the financial crisis far more disruptive than it would have been if risk levels had been disclosed in a straightforward, readily understandable format.{{Citation needed|reason=No source|date=September 2019}}\n\nFor a variety of reasons, market participants did not accurately measure the risk inherent with financial innovation such as MBS and CDOs or understand its effect on the overall stability of the financial system.<ref name=\"Declaration of G20\" /> For example, the pricing model for CDOs clearly did not reflect the level of risk they introduced into the system. Banks estimated that $450 billion of CDO were sold between \"late 2005 to the middle of 2007\"; among the $102 billion of those that had been liquidated, JPMorgan estimated that the average recovery rate for \"high quality\" CDOs was approximately 32&nbsp;cents on the dollar, while the recovery rate for [[mezzanine capital|mezzanine]] CDO was approximately five cents for every dollar.<ref name=\"TPMBLOG1\">{{cite web|date=March 2, 2009|url=http://tpmcafe.talkingpointsmemo.com/talk/blogs/paulw/2009/03/the-power-of-belief.php|title=paulw's Blog &#124; Talking Points Memo &#124; The power of belief|publisher=Tpmcafe.talkingpointsmemo.com|accessdate=November 11, 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090406005046/http://tpmcafe.talkingpointsmemo.com/talk/blogs/paulw/2009/03/the-power-of-belief.php|archivedate=April 6, 2009|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nAnother example relates to [[AIG]], which insured obligations of various financial institutions through the usage of credit default swaps. The basic CDS transaction involved AIG receiving a premium in exchange for a promise to pay money to party A in the event party B defaulted. However, AIG did not have the financial strength to support its many CDS commitments as the crisis progressed and was taken over by the government in September 2008. US taxpayers provided over $180&nbsp;billion in government support to AIG during 2008 and early 2009, through which the money flowed to various counterparties to CDS transactions, including many large global financial institutions.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601109&sid=aKKRHZsxRvWs&refer=home|title=Bloomberg-Credit Swap Disclosure Obscures True Financial Risk|publisher=Bloomberg L.P.|date=November 6, 2008|accessdate=February 27, 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68F8QZzuT?url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=aKKRHZsxRvWs&refer=home|archivedate=June 7, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Byrnes|first=Nanette|url=http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/content/mar2009/db20090316_859460.htm?chan=top+news_top+news+index+-+temp_top+story|title=Business Week-Who's Who on AIG List of Counterparties|work=BusinessWeek|date=March 17, 2009|accessdate=May 1, 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission]] (FCIC) made the major government study of the crisis.

Professional investment managers generally are compensated based on the volume of client [[assets under management]]. There is, therefore, an incentive for asset managers to expand their assets under management in order to maximize their compensation. As the glut in global investment capital caused the yields on credit assets to decline, asset managers were faced with the choice of either investing in assets where returns did not reflect true credit risk or returning funds to clients. Many asset managers continued to invest client funds in over-priced (under-yielding) investments, to the detriment of their clients, so they could maintain their assets under management. They supported this choice with a \"plausible deniability\" of the risks associated with subprime-based credit assets because the loss experience with early \"vintages\" of subprime loans was so low.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Calomiris|first=Charles|title=The Subprime Turmoil: What's Old, What's New, and What's Next|journal=Journal of Structured Finance|volume=15|issue=1|pages=6\u201352|date=Spring 2009|url=http://www.kansascityfed.org/publicat/sympos/2008/Calomiris.03.12.09.pdf|doi=10.3905/JSF.2009.15.1.006|accessdate=August 19, 2010|citeseerx=10.1.1.628.2224|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101125175710/http://kansascityfed.org/publicat/sympos/2008/Calomiris.03.12.09.pdf|archive-date=November 25, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nDespite the dominance of the above formula, there are documented attempts of the financial industry, occurring before the crisis, to address the formula limitations, specifically the lack of dependence dynamics and the poor representation of extreme events.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lipton, A., and A.

These entities became critical to the credit markets underpinning the financial system, but were not subject to the same regulatory controls. Further, these entities were vulnerable because of [[asset liability mismatch|maturity mismatch]], meaning that they borrowed short-term in liquid markets to purchase long-term, illiquid and risky assets. This meant that disruptions in credit markets would make them subject to rapid deleveraging, selling their long-term assets at depressed prices. He described the significance of these entities:\n\n{{quote|In early 2007, asset-backed commercial paper conduits, in structured investment vehicles, in auction-rate preferred securities, tender option bonds and variable rate demand notes, had a combined asset size of roughly $2.2&nbsp;trillion.

These Marxist economists do not point to low wages or underconsumption as the cause of the crisis, but instead point to capitalism's long-term tendency of the [[rate of profit]] to fall as the underlying cause of crises generally. From this point of view, the problem was the inability of capital to grow or accumulate at sufficient rates through productive investment alone. Low rates of profit in productive sectors led to speculative investment in riskier assets, where there was potential for greater return on investment. The speculative frenzy of the late 90s and 2000s was, in this view, a consequence of a rising organic composition of capital, expressed through the fall in the rate of profit. According to Michael Roberts, the fall in the rate of profit \"eventually triggered the credit crunch of 2007 when credit could no longer support profits\".<ref>{{cite web|last=Roberts|first=Michael|url=https://thenextrecession.wordpress.com/2011/07/03/carchedi-foster-and-the-causes-of-crisis/|title=Carchedi, Foster, and the causes of crisis|accessdate=December 13, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 2005, [[John C.

This strategy resulted in rapid growth and a high concentration of risky assets. From its inception as a savings association in 2000, IndyMac grew to the seventh largest savings and loan and ninth largest originator of mortgage loans in the United States. During 2006, IndyMac originated over $90 billion of mortgages.\n\nIndyMac's aggressive growth strategy, use of Alt-A and other nontraditional loan products, insufficient underwriting, credit concentrations in residential real estate in the [[California]] and [[Florida]] markets\u2014states, alongside Nevada and Arizona, where the [[United States housing bubble|housing bubble]] was most pronounced\u2014and heavy reliance on costly funds borrowed from a [[Federal Home Loan Bank]] (FHLB) and from brokered deposits, led to its demise when the mortgage market declined in 2007.\n\nIndyMac often made loans without verification of the borrower's income or assets, and to borrowers with poor credit histories. Appraisals obtained by IndyMac on underlying collateral were often questionable as well. As an Alt-A lender, IndyMac's business model was to offer loan products to fit the borrower's needs, using an extensive array of risky option-[[Adjustable-rate mortgage|adjustable-rate-mortgages]] (option ARMs), subprime loans, 80/20 loans, and other nontraditional products. Ultimately, loans were made to many borrowers who simply could not afford to make their payments. The thrift remained profitable only as long as it was able to sell those loans in the [[secondary mortgage market]].  IndyMac resisted efforts to regulate its involvement in those loans or tighten their issuing criteria: see the comment by Ruthann Melbourne, Chief Risk Officer, to the regulating agencies.<ref name=\"ustreas.gov\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ustreas.gov/inspector-general/audit-reports/2009/oig09032.pdf|title=Audit Report - SAFETY AND SOUNDNESS: Material Loss Review of IndyMac Bank, FSB|accessdate=March 18, 2010 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090419101451/http://www.ustreas.gov/inspector-general/audit-reports/2009/oig09032.pdf|archivedate=April 19, 2009}} Audit Report Office of Inspector General</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fdic.gov/news/news/press/2009/pr09001.html|title=FDIC: Press Releases - PR-1-2009 1/2/2009|website=fdic.gov|accessdate=July 11, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://files.ots.treas.gov/comments/20478116-56b7-4810-938b-60b7688f9652.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=February 24, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120216201626/http://files.ots.treas.gov/comments/20478116-56b7-4810-938b-60b7688f9652.pdf |archivedate=February 16, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nMay 12, 2008, in a small note in the \"Capital\" section of its what would become its last [[10-Q]] released before receivership, IndyMac revealed\u2014but did not admit\u2014that it was no longer a well-capitalized institution and that it was headed for insolvency.\n\nIndyMac reported that during April 2008, [[Moody's]] and [[Standard & Poor's]] downgraded the ratings on a significant number of [[Mortgage-backed security]] (MBS) bonds\u2014including $160 million issued by IndyMac that the bank retained in its MBS portfolio. IndyMac concluded that these downgrades would have harmed the Company's risk-based capital ratio as of June 30, 2008.

Tens of millions of homeowners who had substantial equity in their homes two years ago have little or nothing today. Businesses are facing the worst downturn since the Great Depression. This matters for credit decisions. A homeowner with equity in her home is very unlikely to default on a car loan or credit card debt. They will draw on this equity rather than lose their car and/or have a default placed on their credit record. On the other hand, a homeowner who has no equity is a serious default risk.

With generally good balance of payments positions coming into the crisis or with alternative sources of financing for their large current account deficits, such as remittances, Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) or foreign aid, Arab countries were able to avoid going to the market in the latter part of 2008. This group is in the best position to absorb the economic shocks. They entered the crisis in exceptionally strong positions. This gives them a significant cushion against the global downturn. The greatest effect of the global economic crisis will come in the form of lower oil prices, which remains the single most important determinant of economic performance. Steadily declining oil prices would force them to draw down reserves and cut down on investments. Significantly lower oil prices could cause a reversal of economic performance as has been the case in past oil shocks.

This appreciation in value led large numbers of homeowners (subprime or not) to borrow against their homes as an apparent windfall.

Thus, policymakers did not immediately recognize the increasingly important role played by financial institutions such as investment banks and [[hedge funds]], also known as the [[shadow banking system]].

In the view of some analysts, the relatively conservative [[government-sponsored enterprise]]s (GSEs) policed mortgage originators and maintained relatively high underwriting standards prior to 2003. However, as market power shifted from securitizers to originators and as intense competition from private securitizers undermined GSE power, mortgage standards declined and risky loans proliferated. The worst loans were originated in 2004\u20132007, the years of the most intense competition between securitizers and the lowest market share for the GSEs.\n\n[[File:U.S. Home Ownership and Subprime Origination Share.png|thumb|upright=1.6|US subprime lending expanded dramatically 2004\u20132006]]\n\nAs well as easy credit conditions, there is evidence that competitive pressures contributed to an increase in the amount of subprime lending during the years preceding the crisis.

This pool of money had roughly doubled in size from 2000 to 2007, yet the supply of relatively safe, income generating investments had not grown as fast. Investment banks on Wall Street answered this demand with products such as the [[mortgage-backed security]] and the [[collateralized debt obligation]] that were assigned safe [[Credit rating|ratings]] by the [[credit rating agencies and the subprime crisis|credit rating agencies]].<ref name=\"This American Life\">{{cite web|author=This American Life|url=http://www.pri.org/business/giant-pool-of-money.html|title=NPR-The Giant Pool of Money|publisher=Pri.org|accessdate=May 1, 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100415153017/http://www.pri.org/business/giant-pool-of-money.html|archivedate=April 15, 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn effect, Wall Street connected this pool of money to the mortgage market in the US, with enormous fees accruing to those throughout the mortgage [[supply chain]], from the mortgage broker selling the loans to small banks that funded the brokers and the large investment banks behind them. By approximately 2003, the supply of mortgages originated at traditional lending standards had been exhausted, and continued strong demand began to drive down lending standards.<ref name=\"This American Life\" />\n\nThe collateralized debt obligation in particular enabled financial institutions to obtain investor funds to finance subprime and other lending, extending or increasing the housing bubble and generating large fees. This essentially places cash payments from multiple mortgages or other debt obligations into a single pool from which specific securities draw in a specific sequence of priority.

Financing these deficits required the country to borrow large sums from abroad, much of it from countries running trade surpluses. These were mainly the emerging economies in Asia and oil-exporting nations. The [[balance of payments]] [[identity (mathematics)|identity]] requires that a country (such as the US) running a [[Current account (balance of payments)|current account]] deficit also have a [[capital account]] (investment) surplus of the same amount. Hence large and growing amounts of foreign funds (capital) flowed into the US to finance its imports.\n\nAll of this created demand for various types of financial assets, raising the prices of those assets while lowering interest rates. Foreign investors had these funds to lend either because they had very high personal savings rates (as high as 40% in China) or because of high oil prices.

Too many consumers attempting to save (or pay down debt) simultaneously is called the [[paradox of thrift]] and can cause or deepen a recession. Economist [[Hyman Minsky]] also described a \"paradox of deleveraging\" as financial institutions that have too much leverage (debt relative to equity) cannot all de-leverage simultaneously without significant declines in the value of their assets.<ref name=\"Yellen on Minsky\" />\n\nIn April 2009, US Federal Reserve vice-chair [[Janet Yellen]] discussed these paradoxes:\n\n<blockquote>Once this massive credit crunch hit, it didn't take long before we were in a recession. The recession, in turn, deepened the credit crunch as demand and employment fell, and credit losses of financial institutions surged. Indeed, we have been in the grips of precisely this adverse feedback loop for more than a year. A process of balance sheet deleveraging has spread to nearly every corner of the economy. Consumers are pulling back on purchases, especially on durable goods, to build their savings. Businesses are cancelling planned investments and laying off workers to preserve cash. And, financial institutions are shrinking assets to bolster capital and improve their chances of weathering the current storm. Once again, Minsky understood this dynamic. He spoke of the paradox of deleveraging, in which precautions that may be smart for individuals and firms\u2014and indeed essential to return the economy to a normal state\u2014nevertheless magnify the distress of the economy as a whole.<ref name=\"Yellen on Minsky\" /></blockquote>\n\n===Financial innovation and complexity===\n[[File:CDO - FCIC and IMF Diagram.png|thumb|upright=1.35|right|IMF Diagram of CDO and RMBS]]\nThe term [[financial innovation]] refers to the ongoing development of financial products designed to achieve particular client objectives, such as offsetting a particular risk exposure (such as the default of a borrower) or to assist with obtaining financing. Examples pertinent to this crisis included: the [[adjustable-rate mortgage]]; the bundling of subprime mortgages into [[Mortgage-backed security|mortgage-backed securities]] (MBS) or [[collateralized debt obligation]]s (CDO) for sale to investors, a type of [[securitization]]; and a form of credit insurance called credit default swaps (CDS). The usage of these products expanded dramatically in the years leading up to the crisis. These products vary in complexity and the ease with which they can be valued on the books of financial institutions.{{Citation needed|reason=No source|date=September 2019}}\n\nCDO issuance grew from an estimated $20 billion in Q1 2004 to its peak of over $180 billion by Q1 2007, then declined back under $20 billion by Q1 2008. Further, the credit quality of CDO's declined from 2000 to 2007, as the level of subprime and other non-prime mortgage debt increased from 5% to 36% of CDO assets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hks.harvard.edu/m-rcbg/students/dunlop/2009-CDOmeltdown.pdf|title=2010 CDO Thesis|accessdate=April 22, 2011}}</ref> As described in the section on subprime lending, the CDS and portfolio of CDS called [[synthetic CDO]] enabled a theoretically infinite amount to be wagered on the finite value of housing loans outstanding, provided that buyers and sellers of the derivatives could be found.

It multiplied the number of actors connected to a single mortgage (including mortgage brokers, specialized originators, the securitizers and their due diligence firms, managing agents and trading desks, and finally investors, insurances and providers of repo funding).

Professional investment managers generally are compensated based on the volume of client [[assets under management]]. There is, therefore, an incentive for asset managers to expand their assets under management in order to maximize their compensation. As the glut in global investment capital caused the yields on credit assets to decline, asset managers were faced with the choice of either investing in assets where returns did not reflect true credit risk or returning funds to clients. Many asset managers continued to invest client funds in over-priced (under-yielding) investments, to the detriment of their clients, so they could maintain their assets under management. They supported this choice with a \"plausible deniability\" of the risks associated with subprime-based credit assets because the loss experience with early \"vintages\" of subprime loans was so low.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Calomiris|first=Charles|title=The Subprime Turmoil: What's Old, What's New, and What's Next|journal=Journal of Structured Finance|volume=15|issue=1|pages=6\u201352|date=Spring 2009|url=http://www.kansascityfed.org/publicat/sympos/2008/Calomiris.03.12.09.pdf|doi=10.3905/JSF.2009.15.1.006|accessdate=August 19, 2010|citeseerx=10.1.1.628.2224|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101125175710/http://kansascityfed.org/publicat/sympos/2008/Calomiris.03.12.09.pdf|archive-date=November 25, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nDespite the dominance of the above formula, there are documented attempts of the financial industry, occurring before the crisis, to address the formula limitations, specifically the lack of dependence dynamics and the poor representation of extreme events.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lipton, A., and A.

These entities became critical to the credit markets underpinning the financial system, but were not subject to the same regulatory controls. Further, these entities were vulnerable because of [[asset liability mismatch|maturity mismatch]], meaning that they borrowed short-term in liquid markets to purchase long-term, illiquid and risky assets. This meant that disruptions in credit markets would make them subject to rapid deleveraging, selling their long-term assets at depressed prices. He described the significance of these entities:\n\n{{quote|In early 2007, asset-backed commercial paper conduits, in structured investment vehicles, in auction-rate preferred securities, tender option bonds and variable rate demand notes, had a combined asset size of roughly $2.2&nbsp;trillion.

These Marxist economists do not point to low wages or underconsumption as the cause of the crisis, but instead point to capitalism's long-term tendency of the [[rate of profit]] to fall as the underlying cause of crises generally. From this point of view, the problem was the inability of capital to grow or accumulate at sufficient rates through productive investment alone. Low rates of profit in productive sectors led to speculative investment in riskier assets, where there was potential for greater return on investment. The speculative frenzy of the late 90s and 2000s was, in this view, a consequence of a rising organic composition of capital, expressed through the fall in the rate of profit.

This strategy resulted in rapid growth and a high concentration of risky assets. From its inception as a savings association in 2000, IndyMac grew to the seventh largest savings and loan and ninth largest originator of mortgage loans in the United States. During 2006, IndyMac originated over $90 billion of mortgages.\n\nIndyMac's aggressive growth strategy, use of Alt-A and other nontraditional loan products, insufficient underwriting, credit concentrations in residential real estate in the [[California]] and [[Florida]] markets\u2014states, alongside Nevada and Arizona, where the [[United States housing bubble|housing bubble]] was most pronounced\u2014and heavy reliance on costly funds borrowed from a [[Federal Home Loan Bank]] (FHLB) and from brokered deposits, led to its demise when the mortgage market declined in 2007.\n\nIndyMac often made loans without verification of the borrower's income or assets, and to borrowers with poor credit histories. Appraisals obtained by IndyMac on underlying collateral were often questionable as well. As an Alt-A lender, IndyMac's business model was to offer loan products to fit the borrower's needs, using an extensive array of risky option-[[Adjustable-rate mortgage|adjustable-rate-mortgages]] (option ARMs), subprime loans, 80/20 loans, and other nontraditional products.

With generally good balance of payments positions coming into the crisis or with alternative sources of financing for their large current account deficits, such as remittances, Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) or foreign aid, Arab countries were able to avoid going to the market in the latter part of 2008. This group is in the best position to absorb the economic shocks. They entered the crisis in exceptionally strong positions. This gives them a significant cushion against the global downturn. The greatest effect of the global economic crisis will come in the form of lower oil prices, which remains the single most important determinant of economic performance. Steadily declining oil prices would force them to draw down reserves and cut down on investments. Significantly lower oil prices could cause a reversal of economic performance as has been the case in past oil shocks.
