[[Hajduk Split]] won the league title.\n\nA total of 18 teams competed in the league, with the [[1977\u201378 Yugoslav First League|defending champions]] [[FK Partizan|Partizan]] nearly relegated, finishing the season in the 15th place one point clear of the relegation zone. [[HNK Hajduk Split|Hajduk Split]] and [[NK Dinamo Zagreb|Dinamo Zagreb]] both finished the season on 50 points, but Hajduk won the championship having the better goal difference. However, there was a controversy in the first round when [[HNK Rijeka|Rijeka]] defeated Dinamo 2\u20131 at [[Stadion Kantrida|Kantrida]]. Dinamo claimed that [[Edmond Tomi\u0107]], who joined Rijeka that season from [[KF Liria|Lirija]], didn't serve a one-match suspension following two yellow cards received while playing for his former club. They appealed and after two months it has been decided to award the match 3\u20130 to Dinamo. After several appeals from both sides, in spring 1979 [[Football Association of Yugoslavia]] ruled in favour of Rijeka. The case was brought to Employment Appeal Tribunal, which four years later ruled Dinamo as champions.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ezadar.hr/clanak/neodigrana-utakmica-rijeka-dinamo-novi-slucaja-tomic |title=Neodigrana utakmica Rijeka \u2013 Dinamo, novi Slu\u010daja Tomi\u0107? |last=ts/eZd |first= |date=2 November 2008 |work=ezadar.hr |language=Croatian |accessdate=21 March 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe season began on 12 August 1978 and concluded on 17 June 1979. This was the third and last national title win for Hajduk under the guidance of manager [[Tomislav Ivi\u0107]], who previously led the club to four consecutive [[Yugoslav Cup]] wins in 1972, 1973, 1974 and 1976 (not contested in 1975). Striker [[Du\u0161an Savi\u0107]] of [[Red Star Belgrade|Red Star]] was the top goalscorer with 24 goals. This was the second achievement for Savi\u0107, who previously topped the scoring table in the [[1974\u201375 Yugoslav First League|1974\u201375 season]]. [[HNK Rijeka|Rijeka]] entered the [[1979\u201380 European Cup Winners' Cup]], after defeating [[FK Partizan|Partizan]] in the final of [[Yugoslav Cup]] with an aggregate score 2\u20131.\n\n==Teams==\nA total of eighteen teams contested the league, including sixteen sides from the [[1977\u201378 Yugoslav First League|1977\u201378 season]] and two sides promoted from the 1977\u201378 [[Yugoslav Second League]] (YSL) as winners of the two second level divisions East and West. The league was contested in a [[double round robin]] format, with each club playing every other club twice, for a total of 34 rounds. Two points were awarded for wins and one point for draws.\n\n[[NK \u010celik Zenica|\u010celik Zenica]] and [[FK Trep\u010da|Trep\u010da Kosovska Mitrovica]] were relegated from the [[1977\u201378 Yugoslav First League]] after finishing the season in bottom two places of the league table. The two clubs promoted to top level were [[FK Napredak Kru\u0161evac|Napredak Kru\u0161evac]] and [[FK \u017deljezni\u010dar Sarajevo|\u017deljezni\u010dar Sarajevo]].\n\n{{Location map+ |Yugoslavia

football]] competition of [[SFR Yugoslavia]], since its establishment in 1946. [[Hajduk Split]] won the league title.\n\nA total of 18 teams competed in the league, with the [[1977\u201378 Yugoslav First League|defending champions]] [[FK Partizan|Partizan]] nearly relegated, finishing the season in the 15th place one point clear of the relegation zone. [[HNK Hajduk Split|Hajduk Split]] and [[NK Dinamo Zagreb|Dinamo Zagreb]] both finished the season on 50 points, but Hajduk won the championship having the better goal difference. However, there was a controversy in the first round when [[HNK Rijeka|Rijeka]] defeated Dinamo 2\u20131 at [[Stadion Kantrida|Kantrida]]. Dinamo claimed that [[Edmond Tomi\u0107]], who joined Rijeka that season from [[KF Liria|Lirija]], didn't serve a one-match suspension following two yellow cards received while playing for his former club. They appealed and after two months it has been decided to award the match 3\u20130 to Dinamo. After several appeals from both sides, in spring 1979 [[Football Association of Yugoslavia]] ruled in favour of Rijeka. The case was brought to Employment Appeal Tribunal, which four years later ruled Dinamo as champions.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ezadar.hr/clanak/neodigrana-utakmica-rijeka-dinamo-novi-slucaja-tomic |title=Neodigrana utakmica Rijeka \u2013 Dinamo, novi Slu\u010daja Tomi\u0107? |last=ts/eZd |first= |date=2 November 2008 |work=ezadar.hr |language=Croatian |accessdate=21 March 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe season began on 12 August 1978 and concluded on 17 June 1979. This was the third and last national title win for Hajduk under the guidance of manager [[Tomislav Ivi\u0107]], who previously led the club to four consecutive [[Yugoslav Cup]] wins in 1972, 1973, 1974 and 1976 (not contested in 1975). Striker [[Du\u0161an Savi\u0107]] of [[Red Star Belgrade|Red Star]] was the top goalscorer with 24 goals. This was the second achievement for Savi\u0107, who previously topped the scoring table in the [[1974\u201375 Yugoslav First League|1974\u201375 season]]. [[HNK Rijeka|Rijeka]] entered the [[1979\u201380 European Cup Winners' Cup]], after defeating [[FK Partizan|Partizan]] in the final of [[Yugoslav Cup]] with an aggregate score 2\u20131.\n\n==Teams==\nA total of eighteen teams contested the league, including sixteen sides from the [[1977\u201378 Yugoslav First League|1977\u201378 season]] and two sides promoted from the 1977\u201378 [[Yugoslav Second League]] (YSL) as winners of the two second level divisions East and West. The league was contested in a [[double round robin]] format, with each club playing every other club twice, for a total of 34 rounds. Two points were awarded for wins and one point for draws.\n\n[[NK \u010celik Zenica|\u010celik Zenica]] and [[FK Trep\u010da|Trep\u010da Kosovska Mitrovica]] were relegated from the [[1977\u201378 Yugoslav First League]] after finishing the season in bottom two places of the league table. The two clubs promoted to top level were [[FK Napredak Kru\u0161evac|Napredak Kru\u0161evac]] and [[FK \u017deljezni\u010dar Sarajevo|\u017deljezni\u010dar Sarajevo]].\n\n{{Location map+ |Yugoslavia

An entry in the ''[[Super Mario]]'' series, it follows [[Mario]] and Cappy, a sentient hat that allows Mario to control other characters and objects, as they journey across various worlds to save [[Princess Peach]] from his nemesis [[Bowser (character)|Bowser]], who plans to forcibly marry her. In contrast to the linear gameplay of prior entries, the game returns to the primarily open-ended, exploration-based gameplay featured in ''[[Super Mario 64]]'' and ''[[Super Mario Sunshine]]''.\n\nThe game was developed by Nintendo's [[Entertainment Planning & Development]] division, and began development soon after the release of ''[[Super Mario 3D World]]'' in 2013. Various ideas were suggested during development, and to incorporate them all, the team decided to employ a [[Sandbox game|sandbox]]-style of gameplay. Unlike previous installments such as ''[[New Super Mario Bros.]]'' and ''Super Mario 3D World'', which were aimed at a casual audience, the team designed ''Super Mario Odyssey'' to appeal to the series' core fans.

With Mario gone, Bowser stomps on Mario's cap and lets it drift into the ship's rear propellers, shredding it to pieces. A piece of the hat is grabbed by Cappy, one of the Cap Kingdom's sentient hat-like creatures; he explains to Mario that Bowser also kidnapped his sister Tiara to be used as Peach's wedding [[tiara]]. Cappy joins Mario and takes the shape of Mario's cap, providing him with the ability to temporarily capture other creatures and objects and utilize their abilities. They travel to the nearby Cascade Kingdom, recover an airship, the ''Odyssey'', and begin pursuing Bowser.\n\nMario and Cappy explore the various kingdoms to collect Power Moons to fuel the ''Odyssey'' and battle the Broodals, who steal items including a dress, a cake, and a bouquet from each kingdom to set up Bowser's wedding. Eventually, they catch up to Bowser in his own kingdom and defeat the Broodals for good. However, Bowser subsequently departs for his wedding on the [[Moon]]. Mario and Cappy fly the Odyssey to the Moon's surface and confront Bowser inside a [[cathedral]]. The two sides battle in a cavern, which Mario wins. He frees Peach and Tiara, but the cavern begins to collapse. Mario captures an unconscious Bowser and escapes to the surface with Peach and Tiara. After Peach thanks Mario for his help, Bowser regains consciousness and decides to properly propose to Peach, causing Mario to do the same in haste. Overwhelmed, Peach ends up rejecting both of them. Peach, Cappy and Tiara board the ''Odyssey''.  The rivals are both broken until Peach tells Mario that it's time to go home. Mario boards the ship just in time, leaving Bowser stranded on the Moon.

An entry in the ''[[Super Mario]]'' series, it follows [[Mario]] and Cappy, a sentient hat that allows Mario to control other characters and objects, as they journey across various worlds to save [[Princess Peach]] from his nemesis [[Bowser (character)|Bowser]], who plans to forcibly marry her. In contrast to the linear gameplay of prior entries, the game returns to the primarily open-ended, exploration-based gameplay featured in ''[[Super Mario 64]]'' and ''[[Super Mario Sunshine]]''.\n\nThe game was developed by Nintendo's [[Entertainment Planning & Development]] division, and began development soon after the release of ''[[Super Mario 3D World]]'' in 2013. Various ideas were suggested during development, and to incorporate them all, the team decided to employ a [[Sandbox game|sandbox]]-style of gameplay. Unlike previous installments such as ''[[New Super Mario Bros.]]'' and ''Super Mario 3D World'', which were aimed at a casual audience, the team designed ''Super Mario Odyssey'' to appeal to the series' core fans. The game also features a vocal [[theme song]], \"Jump Up, Super Star!\", a first for the series.\n\n''Super Mario Odyssey'' received universal acclaim from critics who called it one of the best games in the series, as well as one of the greatest games of all time, with particular praise towards its inventiveness and originality.<!-- Do not add that some said it was the best of all time, this is not sourced anywhere in the article.--> It also won numerous awards, including for [[game of the year]]. The game was also a commercial success, selling over 16.59 million copies by December 2019, which makes it one of the [[best-selling Switch games]].\n\n==Gameplay==\n{{multiple image\n| image1 = Super Mario Odyssey, Seaside Kingdom.png\n| caption1 = The player navigates the Seaside Kingdom as [[Mario]], controlling a [[Goomba]] Tower using Cappy's capture ability\n| image2 = Super Mario Odyssey, Cascade Kingdom.png\n| caption2 = A 2D zone in the Cascade Kingdom, one of many [[Side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] sections that imitate the gameplay and visuals of the original ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]''\n| width = 250\n| direction = vertical\n| align = left\n\n}}\n''Super Mario Odyssey'' is a [[platform game]] in which players control [[Mario]] as he travels across many different worlds, known as \"Kingdoms\", on the hat-shaped ship ''Odyssey'', to rescue [[Princess Peach]] from [[Bowser (character)|Bowser]], who plans to forcibly marry her.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Orland|first1=Kyle|title=Super Mario Odyssey brings Mario to Nintendo Switch, the \"real world\"|url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/01/super-mario-odyssey-brings-mario-to-nintendo-switch-the-real-world/|access-date=January 13, 2017|work=Ars Technica|date=January 12, 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170113052211/http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/01/super-mario-odyssey-brings-mario-to-nintendo-switch-the-real-world/|archive-date=January 13, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Tamburro|first1=Paul|title=Super Mario Odyssey is Going to be the Weirdest Mario Game Yet - CraveOnline|url=http://www.craveonline.com/entertainment/1277815-super-mario-odyssey-going-weirdest-mario-game-yet|access-date=June 13, 2017|work=CraveOnline|date=June 13, 2017|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170807233404/http://www.craveonline.com/entertainment/1277815-super-mario-odyssey-going-weirdest-mario-game-yet|archive-date=August 7, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The Kingdoms in the game return to the exploration-based level design featured in ''[[Super Mario 64]]''.<ref name=Business>{{cite news|last1=Gilbert|first1=Ben|title=Forget about that 'Super Mario' game on your iPhone \u2014 this is the new Mario game you're looking for|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/super-mario-odyssey-nintendo-switch-photos-video-2017-1/#its-used-to-great-effect-in-gameplay-in-this-instance-mario-throws-his-hat-and-it-floats-in-mid-air-thus-providing-a-platform-where-mario-can-bounce-to-more-sturdy-footing-11|access-date=January 15, 2017|work=Business Insider|date=January 14, 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170114202720/http://www.businessinsider.com/super-mario-odyssey-nintendo-switch-photos-video-2017-1/#its-used-to-great-effect-in-gameplay-in-this-instance-mario-throws-his-hat-and-it-floats-in-mid-air-thus-providing-a-platform-where-mario-can-bounce-to-more-sturdy-footing-11|archive-date=January 14, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Staff|first1=Paste|title=Super Mario Odyssey Announced for the Nintendo Switch|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2017/01/super-mario-odyssey-announced-for-the-nintendo-swi.html|access-date=January 15, 2017|work=Paste Magazine|date=January 13, 2017|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170116174524/https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2017/01/super-mario-odyssey-announced-for-the-nintendo-swi.html|archive-date=January 16, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref name=Location>{{cite news|last1=Plante|first1=Chris|title=Super Mario Odyssey is an open world sandbox game for Nintendo Switch|url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/12/14257408/nintendo-new-super-mario-odyssey-announced-switch|access-date=January 13, 2017|work=The Verge|date=January 12, 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170114015639/http://www.theverge.com/2017/1/12/14257408/nintendo-new-super-mario-odyssey-announced-switch|archive-date=January 14, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Each Kingdom has Mario searching for and clearing various objectives in order to obtain [[Item (gaming)|items]] known as Power Moons, which can power up the ''Odyssey'' and grant access to new Kingdoms.

[[Mario]] attempts to rescue her but is thrown off the ship and falls into the neighboring Cap Kingdom. With Mario gone, Bowser stomps on Mario's cap and lets it drift into the ship's rear propellers, shredding it to pieces. A piece of the hat is grabbed by Cappy, one of the Cap Kingdom's sentient hat-like creatures; he explains to Mario that Bowser also kidnapped his sister Tiara to be used as Peach's wedding [[tiara]]. Cappy joins Mario and takes the shape of Mario's cap, providing him with the ability to temporarily capture other creatures and objects and utilize their abilities. They travel to the nearby Cascade Kingdom, recover an airship, the ''Odyssey'', and begin pursuing Bowser.\n\nMario and Cappy explore the various kingdoms to collect Power Moons to fuel the ''Odyssey'' and battle the Broodals, who steal items including a dress, a cake, and a bouquet from each kingdom to set up Bowser's wedding. Eventually, they catch up to Bowser in his own kingdom and defeat the Broodals for good. However, Bowser subsequently departs for his wedding on the [[Moon]]. Mario and Cappy fly the Odyssey to the Moon's surface and confront Bowser inside a [[cathedral]]. The two sides battle in a cavern, which Mario wins. He frees Peach and Tiara, but the cavern begins to collapse. Mario captures an unconscious Bowser and escapes to the surface with Peach and Tiara. After Peach thanks Mario for his help, Bowser regains consciousness and decides to properly propose to Peach, causing Mario to do the same in haste. Overwhelmed, Peach ends up rejecting both of them. Peach, Cappy and Tiara board the ''Odyssey''.  The rivals are both broken until Peach tells Mario that it's time to go home. Mario boards the ship just in time, leaving Bowser stranded on the Moon. In the epilogue, Mario returns to the Mushroom Kingdom, where he discovers Peach has packed her bags and left for parts unknown without the knowledge of her servants.\n\n== Development ==\n[[File:Yoshiaki Koizumi at E3 2013 (cropped).JPG|thumb|200px|Longtime Nintendo designer [[Yoshiaki Koizumi]] served as the lead producer of the game|alt=Yoshiaki Koizumi]]\nThe game's development began after ''[[Super Mario 3D World]]'' released in late 2013, and was created by the same development team with assistance from [[1-Up Studio]].{{r|Kotaku: E3 preview}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/04/08/next-3d-mario-game-in-development|title=Next 3D Mario Game in Development|last=Campbell|first=Evan|date=April 8, 2014|website=IGN|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160130102701/http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/04/08/next-3d-mario-game-in-development|archive-date=January 30, 2016|url-status=live|access-date=June 11, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Stevens |first1=Colin |title=The State of Nintendo\u2019s Development Teams |url=https://www.hardcoregamer.com/2018/05/16/the-state-of-nintendos-development-teams/299202/ |website=Hardcore Gamer |accessdate=12 August 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180812213913/https://www.hardcoregamer.com/2018/05/16/the-state-of-nintendos-development-teams/299202/ |archive-date=August 12, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> Under director Kenta Motokura, the team experimented to find fun concepts based on the series' \"theme of surprise\".

The constitution of [[Namibia]] defines the role of the military as ''\"defending the territory and national interests.\"''\n\nNamibia's military was born from the integration of the formerly belligerent [[People's Liberation Army of Namibia]] (PLAN), military wing of the [[South West African People's Organization]], and the [[South West African Territorial Force]] (SWATF) - a security arm of the former South African administration. The British formulated the force integration plan and began training the NDF, which consists of five battalions and a small headquarters element.<ref>http://www.satruth.co.za/peace.htm. Retrieved June 2009</ref> The [[United Nations Transitional Assistance Group]] (UNTAG)'s [[Military of Kenya|Kenyan]] infantry battalion remained in Namibia for three months after independence to assist in training the NDF and stabilize the north. [[Martin Shalli]] and [[Charles Namoloh|Charles 'Ho Chi Minh' Namoloh]] were involved in the negotiations that allowed the Kenyan infantry battalion to remain for that period.\n\n==Purpose==\nThe main roles of the Namibian Defence Force are to ensure the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the country by guarding against external aggression, both conventional and unconventional; prevent violation of Namibia's territorial integrity; and provide assistance to civil authorities in guarding and protecting government buildings and key installations as provided in the Defence Act.<ref>Namibian Ministry of Defence, [http://www.op.gov.na/Decade_peace/mod.htm Ministry of Defence - Introduction]. Retrieved September 2009</ref>\n\nDefence spending and percentage of GDP included $90 million in 1997/98, 2.6% of GDP. The 73.1 million figure in 2002 was 2.4% of GDP. These figures are almost certainly [[CIA World Factbook]] estimates.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Namibian Army WZ523 APC.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Army W523 APC]]\nMajor General A W Dennis, CB, OBE (rtd), [[British Army]], previously Director of Military Assistance Overseas, made the following comments on the initial phase in Namibia at a conference in Pretoria, South Africa on 6 August 1992:<ref>Alasdair Dennis, \"[http://www.issafrica.org/pubs/ASR/SADR5/Dennis.html The Integration of Guerrilla Armies into Conventional Forces: Lessons Learnt from BMATT in Africa] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051229050948/http://www.issafrica.org/Pubs/ASR/SADR5/Dennis.html |date=29 December 2005 }},\" South African Defence Review 5 (1992). Retrieved June 2012. Paper presented at a conference on Changing Dynamics: Military-Strategic Issues for a Future South Africa, hosted by the Institute for Defence Politics in conjunction with the Hanns Seidel Foundation, CSIR conference centre, Pretoria, 6 August 1992.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>You will no doubt recall that the Angola accords were signed in Luanda on 22 December 1988. In November 1989 SWAPO won 57% of the votes in the Namibian General Election and immediately requested the help of a British Military Advisory and Training Team following independence on 21 March 1990. The team, initially 55 strong, was duly deployed on 26 March 1990 and the first leaders cadre, for the 1st and 2nd Battalions, was run from 17 April to 2 June. By 1 July, the 1st Battalion, about 1 000 men strong, accompanied by 5 BMATT Advisors, had deployed to the northern border. By November 1990, only four months later, the 5th Battalion had deployed and in early 1991 the 21st Guards Battalion had also been formed, four staff courses had been run, support weapons and logistics training was well advanced (indeed a logistics battalion deployed as early as July 1990) and an operational test exercise had been conducted. In addition the Ministry of Defence, a mixture of civilian and military personnel, was operating as a department of state. No-one would pretend that everything was working perfectly, nevertheless, a great deal had been achieved in the first year following independence. Most people would probably agree that at some 7 500 strong the Army is unnecessarily large, but sensible plans will need to be made for the employment of any surplus soldiers before they are discharged. Integration has not been easy to achieve, at least in part, because of the need to use several interpreters to cope with the wide variety of languages involved. Battalions are made up of approximately 70% ex-PLAN and 30% ex-SWATF. This mixture could have proved explosive but hounded by their BMATT instructors they united in a common task (or perhaps in the face of a common enemy!) and soon realised that they could work well together. At the higher levels, integration has been more patchy, at least in part because of the departure of most white South African and SWATF officers. But the Government's intentions seem clear in that it decided to split the four MOD directorates evenly, appointing two white and two black (ex PLAN) directors. In all this, BMATT Namibia has played a role remarkably similar to that of BMATT Zimbabwe.</blockquote>\n[[File:Namibian Air Force K-8.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Air Force K-8]]\nIn August 1999, a separatist Lozi faction in the [[Caprivi Strip]] launched a coup attempt (see [[Caprivi conflict]]) which was summarily put down by the Namibian Defence Force.<ref>Source [[Lonely Planet]]</ref> The army has conducted security operations along the northern border with [[Angola]].

The constitution of [[Namibia]] defines the role of the military as ''\"defending the territory and national interests.\"''\n\nNamibia's military was born from the integration of the formerly belligerent [[People's Liberation Army of Namibia]] (PLAN), military wing of the [[South West African People's Organization]], and the [[South West African Territorial Force]] (SWATF) - a security arm of the former South African administration. The British formulated the force integration plan and began training the NDF, which consists of five battalions and a small headquarters element.<ref>http://www.satruth.co.za/peace.htm.

Paper presented at a conference on Changing Dynamics: Military-Strategic Issues for a Future South Africa, hosted by the Institute for Defence Politics in conjunction with the Hanns Seidel Foundation, CSIR conference centre, Pretoria, 6 August 1992.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>You will no doubt recall that the Angola accords were signed in Luanda on 22 December 1988. In November 1989 SWAPO won 57% of the votes in the Namibian General Election and immediately requested the help of a British Military Advisory and Training Team following independence on 21 March 1990. The team, initially 55 strong, was duly deployed on 26 March 1990 and the first leaders cadre, for the 1st and 2nd Battalions, was run from 17 April to 2 June. By 1 July, the 1st Battalion, about 1 000 men strong, accompanied by 5 BMATT Advisors, had deployed to the northern border. By November 1990, only four months later, the 5th Battalion had deployed and in early 1991 the 21st Guards Battalion had also been formed, four staff courses had been run, support weapons and logistics training was well advanced (indeed a logistics battalion deployed as early as July 1990) and an operational test exercise had been conducted. In addition the Ministry of Defence, a mixture of civilian and military personnel, was operating as a department of state. No-one would pretend that everything was working perfectly, nevertheless, a great deal had been achieved in the first year following independence. Most people would probably agree that at some 7 500 strong the Army is unnecessarily large, but sensible plans will need to be made for the employment of any surplus soldiers before they are discharged. Integration has not been easy to achieve, at least in part, because of the need to use several interpreters to cope with the wide variety of languages involved. Battalions are made up of approximately 70% ex-PLAN and 30% ex-SWATF. This mixture could have proved explosive but hounded by their BMATT instructors they united in a common task (or perhaps in the face of a common enemy!) and soon realised that they could work well together. At the higher levels, integration has been more patchy, at least in part because of the departure of most white South African and SWATF officers. But the Government's intentions seem clear in that it decided to split the four MOD directorates evenly, appointing two white and two black (ex PLAN) directors. In all this, BMATT Namibia has played a role remarkably similar to that of BMATT Zimbabwe.</blockquote>\n[[File:Namibian Air Force K-8.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Air Force K-8]]\nIn August 1999, a separatist Lozi faction in the [[Caprivi Strip]] launched a coup attempt (see [[Caprivi conflict]]) which was summarily put down by the Namibian Defence Force.<ref>Source [[Lonely Planet]]</ref> The army has conducted security operations along the northern border with [[Angola]].

He later came to the United States; after opening a small ice cream store on [[Decatur Street (New Orleans)|Decatur Street]], in 1905 he opened a larger ice cream parlor in the 500 block of Ursulines Street in the [[French Quarter]].  In 1921 the establishment moved to a larger space at 617 Ursulines, a white-tiled space with ceiling fans, modeled after fashionable parlors in Palermo.  (The pastry and coffee shop Croissant d'Or now occupies this site, complete with its tiled walls.) This area of the French Quarter was an ethnic Italian neighborhood at the time, but the Italian population moved away over the years.<ref name=\"Scoop\"/><ref name=\"SFAInterview\"/>\n\nAngelo Brocato died in 1946.
