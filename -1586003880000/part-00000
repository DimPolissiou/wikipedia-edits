It features [[Mark Williams (actor)|Mark Williams]] as the eponymous [[crime]]-solving [[Roman Catholic]] [[priest]]. The series is loosely based on [[Father Brown|short stories]] by [[G. K. Chesterton]]. Apart from soap operas, it is the third-longest-running daytime drama series on BBC TV,  after ''[[Doctors (2000 TV series)|Doctors]]'' and ''[[Moving On (TV series)|Moving On]]''.\n\nThe ninth series has been commissioned for broadcast in 2021.<ref>{{cite press release |title=BBC Studios is recommissioned to produce more series of daytime crime dramas |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/bbcstudios/2019/shakespeare-hathaway-father-brown |date=9 September 2019 |access-date=2019-11-14 |website=BBC Media Centre |publisher=[[BBC]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191114205344/https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/bbcstudios/2019/shakespeare-hathaway-father-brown |archive-date=2019-11-14 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe series is set during the mid-1950s, in the fictional [[Cotswold]] village Kembleford, where Father Brown, priest at St Mary's Catholic Church, solves murder cases. A bumbling [[police inspector]], who often arrests the wrong suspect, gets annoyed by Father Brown's success.\n\nFather Brown uses the distinctive skills of his close friends as well as his own wits to solve cases, occasionally to the neglect of his more mundane parish duties. His [[vocation]] as a priest often gives him an insight to the truth, so that justice (but sometimes, not the letter of the law) may be served. His commitment to obeying the [[Seal of the Confessional (Catholic Church)|Seal of the Confessional]] often presents unique circumstances. The time period is when Britain was still struggling with [[Rationing in the United Kingdom#Post-Second World War|deprivations and other hardships]] in the aftermath of the [[Second World War]]. At that time the country still applied the [[death penalty]] as a sentence for [[capital crime]]s such as [[murder]]. Father Brown opposes capital punishment.\n\n==Characters==\n* [[Father Brown]] \u2013 [[Mark Williams (actor)|Mark Williams]] (2013\u2013present): a slightly crumpled, shambolic and mild-mannered Roman Catholic priest who, by appearance, is easily forgotten. His apparent innocence belies a playful wit and a razor-sharp intellect. His greatest strength, both as a priest and as a detective of crime, is his love and understanding of other people. He's not there to judge, but to save souls. He is also a [[World War I]] veteran who served in the [[Gloucestershire Regiment]].\n* Mrs Bridgette McCarthy ''n\u00e9e Maguire'' \u2013 [[Sorcha Cusack]] (2013\u2013present): the Irish [[parish]] secretary at St Mary's. She checks the facts for Father Brown, acts as his confidante on official Church business and everything else, defends him from the ire of the congregation, and makes sure he eats. She has a tendency to brag about her award-winning strawberry scones. Mrs McCarthy is a frequent gossip \u2013 though claims she is not \u2013 and often at odds with Lady Felicia, although she and Lady Felicia eventually admit to being close friends. She is married, but leaves her husband after he returns from having lived with another woman following the war.\n* Felicia, Lady Montague ''n\u00e9e Windermere'' \u2013 [[Nancy Carroll (British actress)|Nancy Carroll]] (2013\u20132016 as a lead character): a bored [[socialite]] and [[Countess]], apparently{{weasel inline|date=September 2019}} from an old [[recusancy|recusant]] family, with a roving eye when her husband, Monty, is away. She is a staunch supporter of Father Brown and frequent [[Archenemy|nemesis]] of Mrs McCarthy, despite a grudging respect between the women. She left at the start of Series 5 after her husband was appointed [[Governor of Northern Rhodesia]], but made a guest appearance in Series 6, ''The Face of the Enemy'', in Series 7 in two episodes (''The Great Train Robbery'' and ''The Honourable Thief''), and in Series 8, ''The Celestial Choir''.\n* Sidney \"Sid\" Carter \u2013 [[Alex Price]] (2013\u20132016 as a lead character): An [[Jack Dawkins|artful dodger]], Sid is an occasional [[black market]]eer, part-time crook and informant who becomes Lady Felicia's chauffeur. Father Brown makes him the church [[handyman]] while trying to keep him on the straight and narrow. His skills and links to the criminal underworld of Kembleford are often needed to solve a case. Originally a regular character, but made guest appearances in Series 5, ''The Sins of Others'', 2016 Christmas Special, ''The Tree of Truth'', Series 6, ''The Face of the Enemy'' and Series 8, ''The River Corrupted''.\n* Zuzanna \"Susie\" Jasinski \u2013 Kasia Koleczek (2013): Father Brown's part-time housekeeper, who lives in a nearby post-war [[Polish Resettlement Corps|Polish resettlement camp]]. Her true first name was revealed in the episode ''The Eye of Apollo\".\n* Lady Penelope \"Bunty\" Windermere \u2013 [[Emer Kenny]] (2017\u2013present): the wayward niece of Lady Felicia seeking refuge after being photographed leaving a sleazy nightclub with a married man and cited in divorce proceedings.\n* Inspector Valentine \u2013 [[Hugo Speer]] (2013\u20132014): head of the local police force, finds himself constantly torn between secret admiration for Father Brown and deep frustration with him. He would like to collaborate, but has been burnt once too often by Brown's unorthodox moral code. Nevertheless, he comes to respect his methods and even admits, upon his departure, that he might miss Father Brown. Valentine returns in the final episode of Series 8, \"\"The Tower of Lost Souls\"\n* Inspector Sullivan \u2013 [[Tom Chambers (actor)|Tom Chambers]] (2014\u20132015): replaced Inspector Valentine, who was promoted to Detective Chief Inspector and went to London at the start of the second series. A somewhat arrogant, complacent man, Sullivan is even more exasperated by Father Brown's meddling but is eventually won over. He made a guest appearance as a Special Branch officer in Series 7, \"The Sacrifice of Tantalus\" under the alias of Inspector Truman. He also  appears in the final episode of Series 8, \"The Tower of Lost Souls\"\n* Inspector Gerry Mallory<!--forename revealed in episode #7.6, The Sacrifice of Tantalus--> \u2013 [[Jack Deam]] (2016\u2013present): the replacement for Inspector Sullivan. Like his predecessors, he is often exasperated by Father Brown, whom he sarcastically refers to as \"Padre\". However, he is a far more zealous (and occasionally resourceful) detective, and chases after leads with great enthusiasm, even when they lead him to the wrong conclusion.\n* Sergeant Albright \u2013 Keith Osborn (2013\u20132014): played [[dogsbody]] to Inspectors Valentine and Sullivan.\n* Sergeant Daniel Goodfellow<!--forename revealed in episode #7.6, The Sacrifice of Tantalus--> \u2013 [[John Burton (actor)|John Burton]] (2014\u2013present): continued playing the [[dogsbody]] for the Inspector with increasing involvement. Credited in the opening beginning in series 5.\n* [[Flambeau (character)|M. Hercule Flambeau]] \u2013 [[John Light (actor)|John Light]] (2013\u2013present): nemesis of Father Brown; jewel and art thief, seems to be without conscience. He and Father Brown have encountered each other at least once in every series; in series four he reveals he has a daughter, Marianne Delacroix, whom he had never met.\n\n===Recurring roles===\n* Bishop Talbot \u2013 [[Malcolm Storry]] (2013\u20132015): he appeared in three episodes. Talbot is Father Brown's superior and doesn't like his sleuthing, but respects him for solving the mysteries. In \"The Daughter of Autolycus\", his death was mentioned. He is succeeded by Bishop Reynard ([[Michael Pennington]]).\n* Harold \"Blind 'Arry\" Slow \u2013 [[Alan Williams (actor)|Alan Williams]] (2017\u2013present): he appeared in four episodes. 'Arry is the rag and bone man for Kembleford and also a drunk. In ''The Darkest Noon'' he mentioned that he got the name \"Blind 'Arry\" after being gassed in [[World War I]] and he also mentions he was a [[Sapper]].\n* Professor Hilary Ambrose \u2013 [[James Laurenson]] (2014\u2013present): he has appeared in two episodes. Ambrose is a theological scholar and friend of Father Brown.\n* Canon Damien Fox \u2013 Roger May (2016\u2013present): he appeared in two episodes. Fox is part of the Diocese and reports to Bishop Reynard.\n* Katherine Corven \u2013 [[Kate O'Flynn]] (2017\u20132018): she appeared in two episodes. In \"The Eagle and the Daw\", she was in prison for murdering her husband. Father Brown had helped to convict her and was awaiting her execution. In \"The Jackdaw's Revenge\", she was cleared of the murder of her husband when someone else confessed to the murder; later in the episode she died from a gunshot.\n* Daniel Whittaker \u2013 [[Daniel Flynn (actor)|Daniel Flynn]] (2015\u2013present): he appeared in two episodes.  Whittaker is a ruthless [[MI5]] agent who blackmails Lady Felicia. In The Man in the Shadows\", he had Sid arrested on false charges after he entered a MI5 room. In \"The Face of the Enemy\", he compelled Lady Felicia to steal (by substitution) a roll of film from one of her lovers, an alleged Soviet spy, and had her arrested on false charges. Father Brown persuaded him to let her go.\n* Marianne Delacroix - [[Gina Bramhill]] (2016-present). Flambeau's daughter equally adept at theft. Two episodes.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Father Brown (TV series) 2013) Main cast.JPG|275px|thumb|(Series One cast) Nancy Carroll, Sorcha Cusack, Mark Williams, Hugo Speer, Kasia Koleczek, and Alex Price]]\n\n===Main===\n<!-- Cast listed in order of credits, and in order of appearance on TV series, as per [[WP:TVCAST]] -->\n* [[Mark Williams (actor)|Mark Williams]] as [[Father Brown]]\n* [[Sorcha Cusack]] as Mrs Bridgette McCarthy \n* [[Hugo Speer]] as Inspector Valentine (Series 1\u2013Series 2, Episode 1: Series 8, episode 10)\n* [[Nancy Carroll (British actress)|Nancy Carroll]] as Lady Felicia Montague (Series 1\u2013Series 5, Episode 2; Series 6, Episode 1 and 5; Series 7, Episode 1 and 10; Series 8, Episode 1)\n* [[Alex Price]] as Sid Carter (Series 1\u20134; Series 5, Episode 11; Series 6, Episode 1 and 5; Series 8, episode 7)\n* Kasia Koleczek as Susie Jasinski (Series 1)\n* Keith Osborn as Sergeant Albright (Series 1\u20132)\n* [[Tom Chambers (actor)|Tom Chambers]] as Inspector Sullivan (Series 2\u20133; Series 7, Episode 6; Series 8, episode 10)\n* [[John Burton (actor)|John Burton]] as Sergeant Daniel Goodfellow<!--forename revealed in episode #7.6, The Sacrifice of Tantalus--> (Series 2\u2013present)\n* [[Jack Deam]] as Inspector Gerry Mallory<!--forename revealed in episode #7.6, The Sacrifice of Tantalus--> (Series 4\u2013present)\n* [[Emer Kenny]] as Penelope (Bunty) Windermere (Series 5\u2013present)\n* [[John Light (actor)|John Light]] as [[Flambeau (character)|M.

In some countries, [[Netflix]] was airing the programme in later years; by 2018, five series were available.<ref name=\"netflix.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.netflix.com/ca/title/80023644|title=Father Brown - Netflix|author=|date=|website=www.netflix.com}}</ref>\n\n===Conception===\nBBC Daytime wanted a home-grown detective show for the afternoons on BBC One. Initially, original ideas from writers were pitched, but the BBC wanted something that was less of a risk and was already well known. Father Brown had not been filmed for British television since the 1970s with [[Kenneth More]]. Executive Producer John Yorke came up with the idea after hearing a radio documentary about G. K. Chesterton presented by [[Ann Widdecombe]].\n\nWriters were given the choice of adapting an existing story or coming up with an original idea. Half of the first ten episodes made were loosely based on Chesterton stories. The Chesterton stories were set all over the world and at different times, but a decision was made to anchor the stories in a fixed place and time.\n\nThe Cotswolds was chosen because it had few modern buildings and was close to the production base in Birmingham. The 1950s was chosen because the detective could solve puzzles using his mind and knowledge of human nature instead of relying on modern technology. Despite this, the script sometimes includes anachronistic language (e.g., \"secure the crime scene\", \"mojo\"). The lead writers, Rachel Flowerday and Tahsin Guner, created the supporting characters. Other writers contributed stand-alone scripts that were not part of a story arc.<ref>{{cite web|last=Meyrick|first=Ceri|title=Father Brown: Your Question answered |url=http://pastoffences.wordpress.com/2012/10/18/father-brown-with-mark-williams-your-questions-answered-by-the-bbc-producer/ |publisher=Past Offences |access-date=2014-01-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140101024807/http://pastoffences.wordpress.com/2012/10/18/father-brown-with-mark-williams-your-questions-answered-by-the-bbc-producer/ |archive-date=2014-01-01 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nSignificant changes were made in some of the episodes ostensibly based on the original works, including \"The Hammer of God\", \"The Wrong Shape\", and \"The Eye of Apollo\".\n\n===Filming===\n[[File:St Peter and St Paul, Blockley.jpg|thumb|[[Church of St Peter and St Paul, Blockley]]]]\nFilming takes place in the [[Gloucestershire]] village of [[Blockley]] using the [[Church of St Peter and St Paul, Blockley]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.blockleychurch.org.uk/notices.htm|title=St Peter and St Paul Church News |access-date=2016-04-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160423071633/http://www.blockleychurch.org.uk/notices.htm |archive-date=2016-04-23 |url-status=live}}</ref> ([[Church of England]]) as the St Mary [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] church of the series and the vicarage transformed into the presbytery for Father Brown's residence.<ref>{{cite news |title=TV series filmed in Cotswolds |url=http://www.cotswoldjournal.co.uk/news/9774502.TV_series_filmed_in_Cotswolds/ |newspaper=Cotswold Journal |location=Worcester |publisher=[[Newsquest]] |date=2012-06-23 |access-date=2014-01-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203045846/http://www.cotswoldjournal.co.uk/news/9774502.TV_series_filmed_in_Cotswolds/ |archive-date=2014-02-03 |url-status=live}}</ref> Other villages used are [[Winchcombe]], [[Upper Slaughter]], [[Kemerton]] and [[Guiting Power]].

It features [[Mark Williams]] as the eponymous [[crime]]-solving [[Roman Catholic]] [[priest]]. The series is loosely based on [[Father Brown|short stories]] by [[G. K. Chesterton]]. Apart from soap operas, it is the third-longest-running daytime drama series on BBC TV,  after ''[[Doctors (2000 TV series)|Doctors]]'' and ''[[Moving On (TV series)|Moving On]]''.\n\nThe ninth series has been commissioned for broadcast in 2021.<ref>{{cite press release |title=BBC Studios is recommissioned to produce more series of daytime crime dramas |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/bbcstudios/2019/shakespeare-hathaway-father-brown |date=9 September 2019 |access-date=2019-11-14 |website=BBC Media Centre |publisher=[[BBC]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191114205344/https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/bbcstudios/2019/shakespeare-hathaway-father-brown |archive-date=2019-11-14 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe series is set during the mid-1950s, in the fictional [[Cotswold]] village Kembleford, where Father Brown, priest at St Mary's Catholic Church, solves murder cases. A bumbling [[police inspector]], who often arrests the wrong suspect, gets annoyed by Father Brown's success.\n\nFather Brown uses the distinctive skills of his close friends as well as his own wits to solve cases, occasionally to the neglect of his more mundane parish duties. His [[vocation]] as a priest often gives him an insight to the truth, so that justice (but sometimes, not the letter of the law) may be served. His commitment to obeying the [[Seal of the Confessional (Catholic Church)|Seal of the Confessional]] often presents unique circumstances. The time period is when Britain was still struggling with [[Rationing in the United Kingdom#Post-Second World War|deprivations and other hardships]] in the aftermath of the [[Second World War]]. At that time the country still applied the [[death penalty]] as a sentence for [[capital crime]]s such as [[murder]]. Father Brown opposes capital punishment.\n\n==Characters==\n* [[Father Brown]] \u2013 [[Mark Williams (actor)|Mark Williams]] (2013\u2013present): a slightly crumpled, shambolic and mild-mannered Roman Catholic priest who, by appearance, is easily forgotten. His apparent innocence belies a playful wit and a razor-sharp intellect. His greatest strength, both as a priest and as a detective of crime, is his love and understanding of other people. He's not there to judge, but to save souls. He is also a [[World War I]] veteran who served in the [[Gloucestershire Regiment]].\n* Mrs Bridgette McCarthy ''n\u00e9e Maguire'' \u2013 [[Sorcha Cusack]] (2013\u2013present): the Irish [[parish]] secretary at St Mary's. She checks the facts for Father Brown, acts as his confidante on official Church business and everything else, defends him from the ire of the congregation, and makes sure he eats. She has a tendency to brag about her award-winning strawberry scones. Mrs McCarthy is a frequent gossip \u2013 though claims she is not \u2013 and often at odds with Lady Felicia, although she and Lady Felicia eventually admit to being close friends. She is married, but leaves her husband after he returns from having lived with another woman following the war.\n* Felicia, Lady Montague ''n\u00e9e Windermere'' \u2013 [[Nancy Carroll (British actress)|Nancy Carroll]] (2013\u20132016 as a lead character): a bored [[socialite]] and [[Countess]], apparently{{weasel inline|date=September 2019}} from an old [[recusancy|recusant]] family, with a roving eye when her husband, Monty, is away. She is a staunch supporter of Father Brown and frequent [[Archenemy|nemesis]] of Mrs McCarthy, despite a grudging respect between the women. She left at the start of Series 5 after her husband was appointed [[Governor of Northern Rhodesia]], but made a guest appearance in Series 6, ''The Face of the Enemy'', in Series 7 in two episodes (''The Great Train Robbery'' and ''The Honourable Thief''), and in Series 8, ''The Celestial Choir''.\n* Sidney \"Sid\" Carter \u2013 [[Alex Price]] (2013\u20132016 as a lead character): An [[Jack Dawkins|artful dodger]], Sid is an occasional [[black market]]eer, part-time crook and informant who becomes Lady Felicia's chauffeur. Father Brown makes him the church [[handyman]] while trying to keep him on the straight and narrow. His skills and links to the criminal underworld of Kembleford are often needed to solve a case. Originally a regular character, but made guest appearances in Series 5, ''The Sins of Others'', 2016 Christmas Special, ''The Tree of Truth'', Series 6, ''The Face of the Enemy'' and Series 8, ''The River Corrupted''.\n* Zuzanna \"Susie\" Jasinski \u2013 Kasia Koleczek (2013): Father Brown's part-time housekeeper, who lives in a nearby post-war [[Polish Resettlement Corps|Polish resettlement camp]]. Her true first name was revealed in the episode ''The Eye of Apollo\".\n* Lady Penelope \"Bunty\" Windermere \u2013 [[Emer Kenny]] (2017\u2013present): the wayward niece of Lady Felicia seeking refuge after being photographed leaving a sleazy nightclub with a married man and cited in divorce proceedings.\n* Inspector Valentine \u2013 [[Hugo Speer]] (2013\u20132014): head of the local police force, finds himself constantly torn between secret admiration for Father Brown and deep frustration with him. He would like to collaborate, but has been burnt once too often by Brown's unorthodox moral code. Nevertheless, he comes to respect his methods and even admits, upon his departure, that he might miss Father Brown. Valentine returns in the final episode of Series 8, \"\"The Tower of Lost Souls\"\n* Inspector Sullivan \u2013 [[Tom Chambers (actor)|Tom Chambers]] (2014\u20132015): replaced Inspector Valentine, who was promoted to Detective Chief Inspector and went to London at the start of the second series. A somewhat arrogant, complacent man, Sullivan is even more exasperated by Father Brown's meddling but is eventually won over. He made a guest appearance as a Special Branch officer in Series 7, \"The Sacrifice of Tantalus\" under the alias of Inspector Truman. He also  appears in the final episode of Series 8, \"The Tower of Lost Souls\"\n* Inspector Gerry Mallory<!--forename revealed in episode #7.6, The Sacrifice of Tantalus--> \u2013 [[Jack Deam]] (2016\u2013present): the replacement for Inspector Sullivan. Like his predecessors, he is often exasperated by Father Brown, whom he sarcastically refers to as \"Padre\". However, he is a far more zealous (and occasionally resourceful) detective, and chases after leads with great enthusiasm, even when they lead him to the wrong conclusion.\n* Sergeant Albright \u2013 Keith Osborn (2013\u20132014): played [[dogsbody]] to Inspectors Valentine and Sullivan.\n* Sergeant Daniel Goodfellow<!--forename revealed in episode #7.6, The Sacrifice of Tantalus--> \u2013 [[John Burton (actor)|John Burton]] (2014\u2013present): continued playing the [[dogsbody]] for the Inspector with increasing involvement. Credited in the opening beginning in series 5.\n* [[Flambeau (character)|M. Hercule Flambeau]] \u2013 [[John Light (actor)|John Light]] (2013\u2013present): nemesis of Father Brown; jewel and art thief, seems to be without conscience. He and Father Brown have encountered each other at least once in every series; in series four he reveals he has a daughter, Marianne Delacroix, whom he had never met.\n\n===Recurring roles===\n* Bishop Talbot \u2013 [[Malcolm Storry]] (2013\u20132015): he appeared in three episodes. Talbot is Father Brown's superior and doesn't like his sleuthing, but respects him for solving the mysteries. In \"The Daughter of Autolycus\", his death was mentioned. He is succeeded by Bishop Reynard ([[Michael Pennington]]).\n* Harold \"Blind 'Arry\" Slow \u2013 [[Alan Williams (actor)|Alan Williams]] (2017\u2013present): he appeared in four episodes. 'Arry is the rag and bone man for Kembleford and also a drunk. In ''The Darkest Noon'' he mentioned that he got the name \"Blind 'Arry\" after being gassed in [[World War I]] and he also mentions he was a [[Sapper]].\n* Professor Hilary Ambrose \u2013 [[James Laurenson]] (2014\u2013present): he has appeared in two episodes.

In \"The Eagle and the Daw\", she was in prison for murdering her husband. Father Brown had helped to convict her and was awaiting her execution. In \"The Jackdaw's Revenge\", she was cleared of the murder of her husband when someone else confessed to the murder; later in the episode she died from a gunshot.\n* Daniel Whittaker \u2013 [[Daniel Flynn (actor)|Daniel Flynn]] (2015\u2013present): he appeared in two episodes.  Whittaker is a ruthless [[MI5]] agent who blackmails Lady Felicia. In The Man in the Shadows\", he had Sid arrested on false charges after he entered a MI5 room.

In some countries, [[Netflix]] was airing the programme in later years; by 2018, five series were available.<ref name=\"netflix.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.netflix.com/ca/title/80023644|title=Father Brown - Netflix|author=|date=|website=www.netflix.com}}</ref>\n\n===Conception===\nBBC Daytime wanted a home-grown detective show for the afternoons on BBC One. Initially, original ideas from writers were pitched, but the BBC wanted something that was less of a risk and was already well known. Father Brown had not been filmed for British television since the 1970s with [[Kenneth More]]. Executive Producer John Yorke came up with the idea after hearing a radio documentary about G. K. Chesterton presented by [[Ann Widdecombe]].\n\nWriters were given the choice of adapting an existing story or coming up with an original idea. Half of the first ten episodes made were loosely based on Chesterton stories. The Chesterton stories were set all over the world and at different times, but a decision was made to anchor the stories in a fixed place and time.\n\nThe Cotswolds was chosen because it had few modern buildings and was close to the production base in Birmingham. The 1950s was chosen because the detective could solve puzzles using his mind and knowledge of human nature instead of relying on modern technology. Despite this, the script sometimes includes anachronistic language (e.g., \"secure the crime scene\", \"mojo\"). The lead writers, Rachel Flowerday and Tahsin Guner, created the supporting characters. Other writers contributed stand-alone scripts that were not part of a story arc.<ref>{{cite web|last=Meyrick|first=Ceri|title=Father Brown: Your Question answered |url=http://pastoffences.wordpress.com/2012/10/18/father-brown-with-mark-williams-your-questions-answered-by-the-bbc-producer/ |publisher=Past Offences |access-date=2014-01-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140101024807/http://pastoffences.wordpress.com/2012/10/18/father-brown-with-mark-williams-your-questions-answered-by-the-bbc-producer/ |archive-date=2014-01-01 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nSignificant changes were made in some of the episodes ostensibly based on the original works, including \"The Hammer of God\", \"The Wrong Shape\", and \"The Eye of Apollo\".\n\n===Filming===\n[[File:St Peter and St Paul, Blockley.jpg|thumb|[[Church of St Peter and St Paul, Blockley]]]]\nFilming takes place in the [[Gloucestershire]] village of [[Blockley]] using the [[Church of St Peter and St Paul, Blockley]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.blockleychurch.org.uk/notices.htm|title=St Peter and St Paul Church News |access-date=2016-04-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160423071633/http://www.blockleychurch.org.uk/notices.htm |archive-date=2016-04-23 |url-status=live}}</ref> ([[Church of England]]) as the St Mary [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] church of the series and the vicarage transformed into the presbytery for Father Brown's residence.<ref>{{cite news |title=TV series filmed in Cotswolds |url=http://www.cotswoldjournal.co.uk/news/9774502.TV_series_filmed_in_Cotswolds/ |newspaper=Cotswold Journal |location=Worcester |publisher=[[Newsquest]] |date=2012-06-23 |access-date=2014-01-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203045846/http://www.cotswoldjournal.co.uk/news/9774502.TV_series_filmed_in_Cotswolds/ |archive-date=2014-02-03 |url-status=live}}</ref> Other villages used are [[Winchcombe]], [[Upper Slaughter]], [[Kemerton]] and [[Guiting Power]].

extradition bill|the Fugitive Offenders amendment bill]] by the [[Hong Kong government]].<ref name=\"bbc_49317695\" /><ref name=\"hkfp_20190213_trojanhorse\" /> Had it been enacted, the bill would have allowed the [[extradition]] of wanted criminal fugitives to territories with which [[Hong Kong]] does not currently have extradition agreements, including [[Mainland China]] and [[Taiwan]].<ref name=\"nyt_20190610_whatis\" /> This led to concerns by some that the bill would subject Hong Kong residents and visitors to the jurisdiction and [[Law of the People's Republic of China|legal system of Mainland China]], thereby undermining [[One country, two systems|the region's autonomy]] and people's civil liberties,<ref name=\"reuters_20190524_eudiplomaticnote\" /><ref name=\"eji_20190523\" /><ref name=\"hkfp_20190522_chrispatten\" /><ref name=\"scmp_3004067\" />  and infringe on privacy and [[Freedom of speech by country|freedom of speech]] laws. As the protests progressed, the protesters laid out five key demands, namely the withdrawal of the bill, investigation into [[Allegations of Hong Kong Police Force misconduct surrounding the 2019 Hong Kong protests|alleged police brutality and misconduct]], the release of all arrested protesters, retraction of the official characterisation of the protests as \"riots\", and [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Chief Executive]] [[Carrie Lam]]'s resignation along with the introduction of [[universal suffrage]] for election of the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]] and for the [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Chief Executive]].<ref name=\"hkfp_20190904_billwithdrawn\" /><ref name=\"abc_66464962\" />\n\nDespite a demonstration attended by hundreds of thousands on 9 June 2019, the government persisted with the bill.<ref name=\"time_5603754\" /><ref name=\"vox_18658650\" /> Protesters gathered outside the [[Legislative Council Complex]] to stall the bill's second reading on 12 June 2019,<ref name=\"scmp_3013797\" /><ref name=\"cnbc_20190610\" /><ref name=\"nyt_20190610_carriestandfast\" /><ref name=\"bloomberg_20190610_pursuebill\" /> resulting in an [[612 Incident|intense standoff]] between the protesters and the police who deployed [[tear gas]] and [[rubber bullet]]s.<ref name=\"time_20190613_battlefront\" /> An even bigger protest took place on 16 June 2019, just one day after the suspension of the bill, as protesters insisted on the complete withdrawal of the bill and reacted to the perceived excessive use of force by the police on 12 June 2019.<ref name=\"scmp_3014695\" /> The anniversary of the handover on 1 July 2019 saw the [[storming of the Legislative Council Complex]],<ref name=\"hkfp_20190701_occupychamber\" /> and subsequent protests throughout the summer spread to different districts.<ref name=\"nyt_20190722_trainstation\" /> The police's inaction when suspected triad members [[2019 Yuen Long attack|assaulted protesters and commuters in Yuen Long]] on 21 July 2019,<ref name=\"bbc_49074532\" /> the [[2019 Prince Edward station attack|police storming of Prince Edward station]] on 31 August 2019, and the large-scale demonstrations during the [[70th anniversary of the People's Republic of China]] on 1 October, caused further escalation of the protests.<ref name=\"amnesty_20190901_policeprotest\" />\n\nLam eventually withdrew the bill on 4 September 2019,<ref name=\"cnn_20190904_withdrawbill\" /><ref name=\"guardian_20190719_extraditionbill\" /><ref name=\"bbc_48917796\" /> but still refused to concede on the other four demands. Claiming to curb further protests, Lam invoked the [[Emergency Regulations Ordinance]] on 4 October 2019 to implement an [[anti-mask law]], to counterproductive effect.<ref name=\"rthk_1484040\" /> As the protests dragged on, confrontations escalated as both sides became increasingly violent.

As there is no extradition treaty with Taiwan (because the [[government of China]] does not recognise its [[Political status of Taiwan|sovereignty]]), the Hong Kong government proposed an amendment to the Fugitive Offenders Ordinance ({{cite Hong Kong ordinance|503}}) and Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Ordinance ({{cite Hong Kong ordinance|525}}) to establish a mechanism for case-by-case transfers of fugitives, on the order of the [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Chief Executive]], to any jurisdiction with which the city lacks a formal extradition treaty.<ref name=\"scmp_3004067\" /> One such jurisdiction would be mainland China.\n\nThe inclusion of mainland China in the amendment is of concern to different sectors of Hong Kong society. Pro-democracy advocates fear the removal of the separation of the region's jurisdiction from mainland Chinese laws administered by the [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]], thereby eroding the \"[[one country, two systems]]\" principle in practice since the 1997 handover. In addition, Hong Kong citizens also lacked confidence in China's judiciary system and human rights protection due to its history of suppressing political dissidents.<ref name=theconversation118753>{{cite web|url=https://theconversation.com/mass-protests-protect-hong-kongs-legal-autonomy-from-china-for-now-118753|title=Mass protests protect Hong Kong's legal autonomy from China \u2013 for now|first=Kelly|last=Chernin|work=[[The Conversation]]|date=18 June 2019|accessdate=14 January 2020}}</ref> Opponents of the bill urged the Hong Kong government to explore other avenues, such as establishing an extradition arrangement solely with Taiwan, and to [[Sunset provision|sunset]] the arrangement immediately after the surrender of the suspect.<ref name=\"scmp_3004067\" /><ref name=\"scmp_3006463\" />\n\nA [[Reuters]] report claims that the Beijing officials had been pushing for an extradition law for 20 years. [[Xiao Jianhua]], a Chinese billionaire residing in Hong Kong, was allegedly abducted by Chinese agents across the border in January 2017 as a spillover of China's [[paramount leader]] and [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|general secretary]] [[Xi Jinping]]'s mass [[Anti-corruption campaign under Xi Jinping|anti-graft campaign]]. The incident was widely reported in Hong Kong, sparking fear among residents. That same year, the [[Central Commission for Discipline Inspection]] (CCDI), the [[Chinese Communist Party]]'s internal anti-corruption body, began pressing Beijing officials in charge of Hong Kong affairs about the urgent need for an extradition arrangement, which it thought to be less damaging politically than kidnapping for snaring fugitive mainlanders in Hong Kong.<ref name=\"reuters_20191220_hkrevolt\"/>\n\n===Underlying causes===\nThe 2019\u201320 Hong Kong protests came four and a half years after the [[Umbrella Revolution]] of 2014, which began after the [[2014 NPCSC Decision on Hong Kong|decision of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress]] (NPCSC) regarding [[2014 Hong Kong electoral reform|proposed reforms to the Hong Kong electoral system]] which were largely seen as restrictive. However, the movement ended in failure as the government offered no concessions.<ref name=\"bbc_48655474\" /> Since then, [[democratic development in Hong Kong|democratic development]] has stalled: only half of the seats in the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]] remain directly elected, and the Chief Executive of Hong Kong continues to be voted by the small-circle [[Election Committee]]. The [[2017 imprisonment of Hong Kong democracy activists]] further dashed the city's hope of meaningful political reform.<ref name=\"time_5661211\" /> Citizens began to fear the loss of the \"high degree of autonomy\" as provided for in the [[Hong Kong Basic Law]], as the government of the People's Republic of China appeared to be increasingly and overtly interfering with Hong Kong's affairs. Notably, the [[Hong Kong Legislative Council oath-taking controversy|Legislative Council oath-taking controversy]] ended with the disqualification of six lawmakers following a ruling by the NPCSC; the [[Causeway Bay Books disappearances]] sparked concerns over state-sanctioned rendition and [[extrajudicial detention]].<ref name=\"bbc_48607723\" /><ref name=\"time_5661211\" /> Another example considered to represent Hong Kong losing its freedoms is its steady fall on the [[Economist Intelligence Unit|Economist Intelligence Unit's]] [[Democracy Index]]. Despite [[universal suffrage]] being part of Hong Kong's [[Hong Kong Basic Law|basic law]], in the 2019 report Hong Kong was scored 6.02/10, classing it in the index as a \"[[Illiberal democracy|flawed democracy]]\", being only 0.02 points off a [[hybrid regime]]. Hong Kong was also only scored 3.59/10 for Electoral process and pluralism, this was the lowest score in the category for a flawed democracy and scoring lower than some [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] countries.

With the approach of 2047, when the Basic Law is set to expire, and along with it the constitutional guarantees enshrined within it, sentiments of an uncertain future have driven youth to join the protests against the extradition bill.<ref name=\"bbc_48655474\" /> For some protesters, the Umbrella Revolution was an inspiration that brought about a political awakening.<ref name=\"bbc_48655474\" /> Others, who felt that peaceful methods were ineffective, resorted to increasingly radical methods to express their views.<ref name=\"mingpao_1566064531\" /><ref name=\"hkfp_20190728_democracyfighters\" /> Media has noted that unlike the 2014 protests, protesters in 2019 were driven by a sense of desperation rather than hope,<ref name=\"guardian_20190702_moodhardens\" /><ref name=\"cnn_20190702_protestsdesperation\" /> and that the aims of the protests had evolved from withdrawing the bill to fighting for greater freedom and liberties.<ref name=\"time_20190815_summerunrest\" />\n\nThe unaffordability of housing prices was also cited as an underlying cause of anger among [[Hong Kongers]].<ref name=\"economist_20190822_unaffordablehousing\" /><ref name=\"aljazeera_190801151538867\" /> Hong Kong is \"the world's most expensive city to buy a home\".<ref name=\"cnbc_20190412_averageprice\" /> This is because, unlike the comparable [[city-state]] of Singapore, Hong Kong has not secured affordable or public housing for the city's population.<ref name=\"scmp_3020789\" /> That is due to the fact that since the [[British Hong Kong|colonial period]], the city's politics have largely been ruled by the business elite.<ref name=\"scmp_1618427\" /> That has also meant a few powerful families having significant influence over [[property development]], with the construction of commercial properties on key real estate with limited competition.<ref name=\"scmp_3025260\" /> Furthermore, a significant amount of the local government's revenue is made from land sales to developers.<ref name=\"scmp_2125469\" />\n\n== Objectives ==\nInitially, protesters solely demanded the withdrawal of the extradition bill. Following an escalation in the severity of policing tactics against demonstrators on 12 June, the objective of the protesters has been to achieve the following five demands (under the slogan \"Five demands, not one less\"):<ref name=\"focustw_20190627_urgeg20\" />\n* '''Complete withdrawal of the extradition bill from the legislative process''': Although the chief executive announced indefinite suspension of the bill on 15 June, reading on it may be quickly resumed. The bill was \"pending resumption of second reading\" in the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|legislative council]]. The bill was formally withdrawn on 23 October.<ref name=\"reuters_20191023_officiallykilled\" />\n* '''Retraction of the \"riot\" characterisation''': The government originally characterised the 12 June protest as \"riots\". Later the description was amended to say there were \"some\" protesters who rioted. However, protesters contest the existence of acts of rioting during the 12 June protest. Through the government's characterization of the protests as \"riots\", any protester who was arrested could spend up to 10 years in prison.\n* '''Release and exoneration of arrested protesters''': Protesters consider the arrests to be politically motivated; they also question the legitimacy of police arresting protesters at hospitals through access to their confidential medical data in breach of patient privacy.\n* '''Establishment of an independent commission of inquiry into police conduct and use of force during the protests''': Civic groups felt that the level of violence used by the police on 12 June, specifically those against protesters who were not committing any offences when they were set upon, was unjustified; police performing stop-and-search on numerous passers-by near the protest site without probable cause was also considered abusive.<ref name=\"rfa_06112019114440\" /> Some officers' failure to display or show their police identification number or warrant card despite being required to do so by the Police General Orders<!-- PGO is technically not law --> is seen to be a breakdown of accountability.<ref name=\"standnews_20190627\" /> The existing watchdog, the [[Independent Police Complaints Council]], lacks independence, and its functioning relies on police co-operation. As the number of allegations of police brutality and misconduct continued to increase, some Hong Kong protesters began to call for the disbandment of the police force.<ref name=\"scmp_3030211\" />\n* '''Resignation of [[Carrie Lam]] and the implementation of universal suffrage for [[Hong Kong legislative elections|Legislative Council elections]] and for the election of the [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Chief Executive]]''':<ref name=\"nyt_20190708_moredemocracy\" /> Currently, the chief executive is selected by the 1,200-member [[Election Committee]], and 30 of the 70 legislative council seats are filled by representatives from different sectors of the economy, forming the majority of the so-called [[Functional constituency (Hong Kong)|functional constituencies]], most of which have few electors.\n\n==History==\n===Early demonstrations===\n{{Main|Timeline of the 2019\u201320 Hong Kong protests (March\u2013June 2019)}}\n\n[[File:Harcourt Road tear smoke view1 20190612.jpg|left|thumb|The police used [[tear gas]] to disperse protesters gathering outside the Legislative Council Complex on 12 June.]]\nA sit-in by [[Demosist\u014d]] held at the [[Central Government Complex (Hong Kong)|Central Government Complex]] on 15 March was the first protest against the extradition bill.<ref name=\"now_340955\" /> The [[Civil Human Rights Front]] (CHRF), a platform for 50 [[pro-democracy camp (Hong Kong)|pro-democracy groups]], launched a protest march against the bill on 31 March 2019 and another on 28 April 2019.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190331_12000protest\" /> The anti-extradition issue attracted more attention when pro-democratic lawmakers in the legislative council launched a [[filibuster]] campaign against the bill.

The panel reiterated their criticisms of the IPCC, while the IPCC chairman [[Anthony Neoh]] said that the suggestions by the expert panel have exceeded the \"statutory functions\" of the police watchdog.<ref name=\"rthk_1496472\"/><ref name=\"rthk_1497054\"/>\n\nThe police modified the Police General Orders by removing the sentence \"officers will be accountable for their own actions\" ahead of the 1 October confrontation. Police commanders reportedly ignored the wrongdoings and the unlawful behaviours of frontline riot police and refused to use any of the disciplinary measure to avoid upsetting them. As of December 2019, no officer has been suspended for their actions. The lack of prosecution against officers sparked fears that the police cannot be held accountable for their actions and that they are immune to any legal consequence; as of 24 December 2019, no police have been charged or prosecuted over protest-related actions.<ref name=\"WPost Police misconduct\"/>\n\n==Impacts==\n===Effects on economy===\n[[File:Hong Kong IMG 20190726 161256 (48379850001).jpg|thumb|left|Protest at the [[Hong Kong International Airport]] on 26 July 2019.]]\n\nOfficial total statistics showed that Hong Kong had slipped into recession as its economy had shrunk in the second and third quarters of 2019.<ref name=\"bi_20191029_retailersdestroyed\"/> Retail sales have declined and consumers' appetite for spending has decreased.<ref name=\"scmp_3017580\"/> During the days of protests, protesters brought \"mixed fortunes\" to the businesses according to the ''[[South China Morning Post]]''. Some restaurants saw their customers cancelling their bookings and some banks and shops were forced to shut their doors. Supplies for goods were also halted and obstructed due to the protest. Meanwhile, some shops prospered as nearby protesters bought food and other commodities.<ref name=\"scmp_3014240\"/> Due to lower consumer spending, several luxury brands delayed the opening of their shops.<ref name=scmp3038400>{{cite web|url=https://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/fashion-beauty/article/3038400/chanel-rimowa-delay-new-stores-prada-moving-out-sales|title=Chanel, Rimowa delay new stores, Prada moving out, sales plummet at Moncler, Gucci \u2013 will Hong Kong become city of 'ghost malls'?|first=Vincenzo|last=La Torre|work=[[South China Morning Post]]|date=20 November 2019|accessdate=19 February 2020}}</ref> Protest supplies such as gas masks were running low in stock in both Hong Kong and Taiwan.<ref name=\"asiatimes_20190813_gasmasks\"/>\n\nThe protests also affected property owners. Fearing the instability in Hong Kong, some investors abandoned the purchases of land. Desire to purchase properties also declined, as overall property transactions declined by 24% when compared with the Umbrella Revolution. Property developers were forced to reduce the selling price.<ref name=\"scmp_3024412\"/> Trade shows reported decreased attendance and revenue, and many firms cancelled their events in Hong Kong.<ref name=\"scmp_3037982\"/> The [[Hang Seng Index]] declined by at least 4.8% from 9 June to late August. As interest in trading waned, companies that had already applied for [[initial public offering]]s (IPO) in Hong Kong urged their bankers to put their listing on hold. August 2019 recorded only one IPO, which was the lowest since 2012, and two large IPOs were shelved respectively in June and July. [[Fitch Ratings]] downgraded Hong Kong's sovereignty rating from AA+ to AA due to doubts over the government's ability to maintain the \"one country, two systems\" principle; the outlook of the city was similarly lowered from \"stable\" to \"negative\".<ref name=\"scmp_3026109\"/>\n\nTourism was also affected. The number of visitors travelling to Hong Kong declined by 40% in August 2019 compared to August 2018,<ref name=\"reuters_20190909_40%plunge\"/> while the decline was 31.9% for the days during and after [[National Day of the People's Republic of China|National Day]].<ref name=\"cnn_20191010_holidaydip\"/> As a consequence, both the tourist sector and the food and beverage industry saw an increased unemployment rate.<ref name=\"scmp_3024412\"/><ref name=\"scmp_3034595\"/> Flight bookings also declined, with airlines cutting or reducing their services.<ref name=\"scmp_3038102\"/> During the airport protests on 12 and 13 August 2019, the [[Airport Authority Hong Kong|Airport Authority]] cancelled numerous flights, which resulted in an estimated US$76&nbsp;million loss according to aviation experts.<ref name=\"cna_11842026\"/> [[Hong Kong Disneyland]] also revealed that there were fewer guests visiting. Many mainland tourists avoided travelling to Hong Kong due to safety concerns. Various countries have since issued travel warnings to Hong Kong.<ref name=\"bbc_49276259\"/>\n\n===Effects on society===\n[[Carrie Lam as Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Lam's administration]] received criticisms for its performance during the protests. Carrie Lam's perceived arrogance,<ref name=\"standardhk_129761\"/> her extended absence, reluctance to engage in dialogue with protesters, and subpar performance at press conferences,<ref name=\"ft_20190830_policefurious\"/> were believed to have enabled the protests to escalate.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190707_missingleader\"/> At a press conference on 5 August, Lam explained her absence from the public eye in the preceding two weeks by the risks for organisers regarding possible disruption of public events and press conferences by protesters.<ref name=\"scmp_3021459\"/> According to polls conducted by the Hong Kong Public Opinion Research Institute, Lam's approval ratings declined to 22.3 in October, lowest among all chief executives, and her performance was categorised as \"disastrous\" alongside [[Secretary for Security]] [[John Lee (government official)|John Lee]] and [[Secretary for Justice (Hong Kong)|Secretary for Justice]] [[Teresa Cheng (politician)|Teresa Cheng]], prompting institute director [[Robert Chung]] to describe the situation as \"dire\".<ref name=\"hkfp_20191009_ratingplunges\"/> [[Ma Ngok]], a political scientist, remarked that the government \"has lost the trust of a whole generation\" and predicted that the youths would remain angry at both the government and the police \"for years to come\".<ref name=\"guardian_20190811_lacktrust\"/> According to ''[[The Diplomat]]'', there was also the emergence of the concept of \"mutually assured destruction\" ({{zh|labels=no|t=\u652c\u7092}}) where protesters became more radical to compel the administration to concede, while the establishment waited for their increase in aggressiveness so that they can justify the greater militarisation of the police and dismissed the protesters as \"insurgents\" and their demands.<ref name=\"diplomat_20190906_madrhetoric\"/> Rifts within the government were also formed with Lennon Walls being set up in government offices and civil servants organising rallies.<ref name=\"scmp_3020206\"/>\n\n[[File:P1120823 (49001440122).jpg|thumb|left|A riot police officer held up a blue flag warning the protesters

name=\"standardhk_132961\"/> In October, a survey conducted by CUHK revealed that more than 50% of the respondents were deeply dissatisfied with the police's performance.<ref name=\"independent_9158061\"/> According to some reports, the police's aggressive behaviours and tactics have caused them to become a symbol that represented hostility and suppression and police's actions on the protesters has resulted in a breakdown of citizens' trust towards the police.<ref name=\"aljazeera_191101070008742\"/><ref name=\"atlantic_597205\"/><ref name=\"hkfp_20180628_lostgoodwill\"/> Citizens were also concerned about the police's ability to regulate and control itself and feared about its abuse of power.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190910_offdutybatons\"/> The suspected acts of police brutality have turned some politically neutral citizens to become more sympathetic with the young protesters.<ref name=\"wsj_11567458226\"/> Fearing Hong Kong changing into a [[police state]], some citizens were actively considering emigration.<ref name=\"cnn_20191008_hkleave\"/> For the police, some lower-ranking officers reported feeling \"lost and confused\", citing \"a lack of leadership\" during important moments,<ref name=\"reuters_20190717_underpressure\"/> and was reportedly discontent with the government, as its extended absence left the police to be the only group to clash with the protesters, resulting in the two groups developing immense mutual hatred for each other.<ref name=\"ft_20190830_policefurious\"/> The police has cancelled foot patrol due to fear that they may be attacked,<ref name=\"scmp_3025140\"/> and issued extendable batons to off-duty officers.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190910_offdutybatons\"/> Frontline officers and protesters have insulted each other with degradative terms.<ref name=\"wp_20191104_insultsdangerous\"/><ref name=\"coconutshk_20190826\"/><ref name=\"scmp_3025159\"/> Police officers also reported being \"physically and mentally\" tired, as they faced the risks of being [[doxed]], [[cyberbullying|cyberbullied]], and distanced by their family members.<ref name=\"cnn_20190815_policeside\"/> The police's relations with journalists,<ref name=\"scmp_3017673\"/> social workers,<ref

strained.\n\nTo cope with the ongoing protests, on 15 November 2019, the police had appointed no more than 100 [[Correctional Services Department]] officers as special constables to assist the police force.<ref name=\"scmp_3038039\"/> Due to internal redeployment of staff within the force to deal with the protests, anti-crime operations were \"smaller and less frequent than in the past\".

The police later backed down on the claim, saying that among the protesters, only five of them rioted. Protesters have since demanded the government to fully retract the riot characterisation.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190618_backdown\"/> Lam's analogy as Hong Kong people's mother attracted criticisms after the violent crackdown on 12 June.<ref name=\"standardhk_129667\"/>\n\nLam announced the suspension of the bill on 15 June,<ref name=\"scmp_3014669\"/> and officially apologised to the public on 18 June two days after another massive march.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190618_sincereapologies\"/> In early July, Lam reiterated that the bill \"had passed away\" and reaffirmed that all efforts to amend the law had ceased, though her use of language was thought to be ambiguous.<ref name=\"guardian_20190709_deadbill\"/> During July and August, the government insisted that it would not make any concessions, and that Lam could still lead the government despite calls asking her to resign.

However, protesters and democrats had previously affirmed that all the five core demands must be answered.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190904_billwithdrawn\"/> Her concession was described as \"too little, too late\", as the conflicts would not have escalated if she had withdrawn the bill during the early stage of the protest.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190904_toolittle\" /><ref name=\"medium_20190907_govburn\"/> The first dialogue session was held on 26 September.

conference, Carrie Lam used a Cantonese phrase to say the proposed legislation was 'reaching the end of its life.' Her government suspended the progress of the bill after demonstrations last month ... 'We suspended it and we have no timetable,' Lam said. 'What I said today is not very different from before, but maybe people want to hear a very firm response ... the bill has actually died. So people won't need to worry that there will be renewed discussions on the bill in the current legislature.' Protesters rejected her remarks and promised to continue the demonstrations. Figo Chan Ho-wun of the Civil Human Rights Front said: 'I urge Carrie Lam not to use words to deceive us.

extradition bill|the Fugitive Offenders amendment bill]] by the [[Hong Kong government]].<ref name=\"bbc_49317695\" /><ref name=\"hkfp_20190213_trojanhorse\" /> Had it been enacted, the bill would have allowed the [[extradition]] of wanted criminal fugitives to territories with which [[Hong Kong]] does not currently have extradition agreements, including [[Mainland China]] and [[Taiwan]].<ref name=\"nyt_20190610_whatis\" /> This led to concerns by some that the bill would subject Hong Kong residents and visitors to the jurisdiction and [[Law of the People's Republic of China|legal system

/><ref name=\"hkfp_20190522_chrispatten\" /><ref name=\"scmp_3004067\" />  and infringe on privacy and [[Freedom of speech by country|freedom of speech]] laws. As the protests progressed, the protesters laid out five key demands, namely the withdrawal of the bill, investigation into [[Allegations of Hong Kong Police Force misconduct surrounding the 2019 Hong Kong protests|alleged police brutality and misconduct]], the release of all arrested protesters, retraction of the official characterisation of the protests as \"riots\", and [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Chief Executive]] [[Carrie Lam]]'s resignation along with the introduction of [[universal suffrage]] for election of the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]] and for the [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Chief Executive]].<ref name=\"hkfp_20190904_billwithdrawn\" /><ref name=\"abc_66464962\" />\n\nDespite a demonstration attended by hundreds of thousands on 9 June 2019, the government persisted with the bill.<ref name=\"time_5603754\" /><ref name=\"vox_18658650\" /> Protesters gathered outside the [[Legislative Council Complex]] to stall the bill's second reading on 12 June 2019,<ref name=\"scmp_3013797\" /><ref name=\"cnbc_20190610\" /><ref name=\"nyt_20190610_carriestandfast\" /><ref name=\"bloomberg_20190610_pursuebill\" /> resulting in an [[612 Incident|intense standoff]] between the protesters and the police who deployed [[tear gas]] and [[rubber bullet]]s.<ref name=\"time_20190613_battlefront\" /> An even bigger protest took place on 16 June 2019, just one day after the suspension of the bill, as protesters insisted on the complete withdrawal of the bill and reacted to the perceived excessive use of force by the police on 12 June 2019.<ref name=\"scmp_3014695\" /> The anniversary of the handover on 1 July 2019 saw the [[storming of the Legislative Council Complex]],<ref name=\"hkfp_20190701_occupychamber\" /> and subsequent protests throughout the summer spread to different districts.<ref name=\"nyt_20190722_trainstation\" /> The police's inaction when suspected triad members [[2019 Yuen Long attack|assaulted protesters and commuters in Yuen Long]] on 21 July 2019,<ref name=\"bbc_49074532\" /> the [[2019 Prince Edward station attack|police storming of Prince Edward station]] on 31 August 2019, and the large-scale demonstrations during the [[70th anniversary of the People's Republic of China]] on 1 October, caused further escalation of the protests.<ref name=\"amnesty_20190901_policeprotest\" />\n\nLam eventually withdrew the bill on 4 September 2019,<ref name=\"cnn_20190904_withdrawbill\" /><ref name=\"guardian_20190719_extraditionbill\" /><ref name=\"bbc_48917796\" /> but still refused to concede on the other four demands. Claiming to curb further protests, Lam invoked the [[Emergency Regulations Ordinance]] on 4 October 2019 to implement an [[anti-mask law]], to counterproductive effect.<ref name=\"rthk_1484040\" /> As the protests dragged on, confrontations escalated as both sides became increasingly violent.

As there is no extradition treaty with Taiwan (because the [[government of China]] does not recognise its [[Political status of Taiwan|sovereignty]]), the Hong Kong government proposed an amendment to the Fugitive Offenders Ordinance ({{cite Hong Kong ordinance|503}}) and Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Ordinance ({{cite Hong Kong ordinance|525}}) to establish a mechanism for case-by-case transfers of fugitives, on the order of the [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Chief Executive]], to any jurisdiction with which the city lacks a formal extradition treaty.<ref name=\"scmp_3004067\" /> One such jurisdiction would be mainland China.\n\nThe inclusion of mainland China in the amendment is of concern to different sectors of Hong Kong society. Pro-democracy advocates fear the removal of the separation of the region's jurisdiction from mainland Chinese laws administered by the [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]], thereby eroding the \"[[one country, two systems]]\" principle in practice since the 1997 handover. In addition, Hong Kong citizens also lacked confidence in China's judiciary system and human rights protection due to its history of suppressing political dissidents.<ref name=theconversation118753>{{cite web|url=https://theconversation.com/mass-protests-protect-hong-kongs-legal-autonomy-from-china-for-now-118753|title=Mass protests protect Hong Kong's legal autonomy from China \u2013 for now|first=Kelly|last=Chernin|work=[[The Conversation]]|date=18 June 2019|accessdate=14 January 2020}}</ref> Opponents of the bill urged the Hong Kong government to explore other avenues, such as establishing an extradition arrangement solely with Taiwan, and to [[Sunset provision|sunset]] the arrangement immediately after the surrender of the suspect.<ref name=\"scmp_3004067\" /><ref name=\"scmp_3006463\" />\n\nA [[Reuters]] report claims that the Beijing officials had been pushing for an extradition law for 20 years. [[Xiao Jianhua]], a Chinese billionaire residing in Hong Kong was allegedly abducted by Chinese agents across the border in January 2017 as a spillover of China's [[paramount leader]] and [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|general secretary]] [[Xi Jinping]]'s mass [[Anti-corruption campaign under Xi Jinping|anti-graft campaign]]. The incident was widely reported in Hong Kong, sparking fear among residents. That same year, the [[Central Commission for Discipline Inspection]] (CCDI), the [[Chinese Communist Party]]'s internal anti-corruption body, began pressing Beijing officials in charge of Hong Kong affairs about the urgent need for an extradition arrangement, which it thought to be less damaging politically than kidnapping for snaring fugitive mainlanders in Hong Kong.<ref name=\"reuters_20191220_hkrevolt\"/>\n\n===Underlying causes===\nThe 2019\u201320 Hong Kong protests came four and a half years after the [[Umbrella Revolution]] of 2014, which began after the [[2014 NPCSC Decision on Hong Kong|decision of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress]] (NPCSC) regarding [[2014 Hong Kong electoral reform|proposed reforms to the Hong Kong electoral system]] which were largely seen as restrictive. However, the movement ended in failure as the government offered no concessions.<ref name=\"bbc_48655474\" /> Since then, [[democratic development in Hong Kong|democratic development]] has stalled: only half of the seats in the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]] remain directly elected, and the Chief Executive of Hong Kong continues to be voted by the small-circle [[Election Committee]]. The [[2017 imprisonment of Hong Kong democracy activists]] further dashed the city's hope of meaningful political reform.<ref name=\"time_5661211\" /> Citizens began to fear the loss of the \"high degree of autonomy\" as provided for in the [[Hong Kong Basic Law]], as the government of the People's Republic of China appeared to be increasingly and overtly interfering with Hong Kong's affairs. Notably, the [[Hong Kong Legislative Council oath-taking controversy|Legislative Council oath-taking controversy]] ended with the disqualification of six lawmakers following a ruling by the NPCSC; the [[Causeway Bay Books disappearances]] sparked concerns over state-sanctioned rendition and [[extrajudicial detention]].<ref name=\"bbc_48607723\" /><ref name=\"time_5661211\" /> Another example considered to represent Hong Kong losing its freedoms is its steady fall on the [[Economist Intelligence Unit|Economist Intelligence Unit's]] [[Democracy Index]]. Despite [[universal suffrage]] being part of Hong Kong's [[Hong Kong Basic Law|basic law]], in the 2019 report Hong Kong was scored 6.02/10, classing it in the index as a \"[[Illiberal democracy|flawed democracy]]\", being only 0.02 points off a [[hybrid regime]]. Hong Kong was also only scored 3.59/10 for Electoral process and pluralism, this was the lowest score in the category for a flawed democracy and scoring lower than some [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] countries.

With the approach of 2047, when the Basic Law is set to expire, and along with it the constitutional guarantees enshrined within it, sentiments of an uncertain future have driven youth to join the protests against the extradition bill.<ref name=\"bbc_48655474\" /> For some protesters, the Umbrella Revolution was an inspiration that brought about a political awakening.<ref name=\"bbc_48655474\" /> Others, who felt that peaceful methods were ineffective, resorted to increasingly radical methods to express their views.<ref name=\"mingpao_1566064531\" /><ref name=\"hkfp_20190728_democracyfighters\" /> Media has noted that unlike the 2014 protests, protesters in 2019 were driven by a sense of desperation rather than hope,<ref name=\"guardian_20190702_moodhardens\" /><ref name=\"cnn_20190702_protestsdesperation\" /> and that the aims of the protests had evolved from withdrawing the bill to fighting for greater freedom and liberties.<ref name=\"time_20190815_summerunrest\" />\n\nThe unaffordability of housing prices was also cited as an underlying cause of anger among [[Hong Kongers]].<ref name=\"economist_20190822_unaffordablehousing\" /><ref name=\"aljazeera_190801151538867\" /> Hong Kong is \"the world's most expensive city to buy a home\".<ref name=\"cnbc_20190412_averageprice\" /> This is because, unlike the comparable [[city-state]] of Singapore, Hong Kong has not secured affordable or public housing for the city's population.<ref name=\"scmp_3020789\" /> That is due to the fact that since the [[British Hong Kong|colonial period]], the city's politics have largely been ruled by the business elite.<ref name=\"scmp_1618427\" /> That has also meant a few powerful families having significant influence over [[property development]], with the construction of commercial properties on key real estate with limited competition.<ref name=\"scmp_3025260\" /> Furthermore, a significant amount of the local government's revenue is made from land sales to developers.<ref name=\"scmp_2125469\" />\n\n== Objectives ==\nInitially, protesters solely demanded the withdrawal of the extradition bill. Following an escalation in the severity of policing tactics against demonstrators on 12 June, the objective of the protesters has been to achieve the following five demands (under the slogan \"Five demands, not one less\"):<ref name=\"focustw_20190627_urgeg20\" />\n* '''Complete withdrawal of the extradition bill from the legislative process''': Although the chief executive announced indefinite suspension of the bill on 15 June, reading on it may be quickly resumed. The bill was \"pending resumption of second reading\" in the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|legislative council]]. The bill was formally withdrawn on 23 October.<ref name=\"reuters_20191023_officiallykilled\" />\n* '''Retraction of the \"riot\" characterisation''': The government originally characterised the 12 June protest as \"riots\". Later the description was amended to say there were \"some\" protesters who rioted. However, protesters contest the existence of acts of rioting during the 12 June protest. Through the government's characterization of the protests as \"riots\", any protester who was arrested could spend up to 10 years in prison.\n* '''Release and exoneration of arrested protesters''': Protesters consider the arrests to be politically motivated; they also question the legitimacy of police arresting protesters at hospitals through access to their confidential medical data in breach of patient privacy.\n* '''Establishment of an independent commission of inquiry into police conduct and use of force during the protests''': Civic groups felt that the level of violence used by the police on 12 June, specifically those against protesters who were not committing any offences when they were set upon, was unjustified; police performing stop-and-search on numerous passers-by near the protest site without probable cause was also considered abusive.<ref name=\"rfa_06112019114440\" /> Some officers' failure to display or show their police identification number or warrant card despite being required to do so by the Police General Orders<!-- PGO is technically not law --> is seen to be a breakdown of accountability.<ref name=\"standnews_20190627\" /> The existing watchdog, the [[Independent Police Complaints Council]], lacks independence, and its functioning relies on police co-operation. As the number of allegations of police brutality and misconduct continued to increase, some Hong Kong protesters began to call for the disbandment of the police force.<ref name=\"scmp_3030211\" />\n* '''Resignation of [[Carrie Lam]] and the implementation of universal suffrage for [[Hong Kong legislative elections|Legislative Council elections]] and for the election of the [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Chief Executive]]''':<ref name=\"nyt_20190708_moredemocracy\" /> Currently, the chief executive is selected by the 1,200-member [[Election Committee]], and 30 of the 70 legislative council seats are filled by representatives from different sectors of the economy, forming the majority of the so-called [[Functional constituency (Hong Kong)|functional constituencies]], most of which have few electors.\n\n==History==\n===Early demonstrations===\n{{Main|Timeline of the 2019\u201320 Hong Kong protests (March\u2013June 2019)}}\n\n[[File:Harcourt Road tear smoke view1 20190612.jpg|left|thumb|The police used [[tear gas]] to disperse protesters gathering outside the Legislative Council Complex on 12 June.]]\nA sit-in by [[Demosist\u014d]] held at the [[Central Government Complex (Hong Kong)|Central Government Complex]] on 15 March was the first protest against the extradition bill.<ref name=\"now_340955\" /> The [[Civil Human Rights Front]] (CHRF), a platform for 50 [[pro-democracy camp (Hong Kong)|pro-democracy groups]], launched a protest march against the bill on 31 March 2019 and another on 28 April 2019.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190331_12000protest\" /> The anti-extradition issue attracted more attention when pro-democratic lawmakers in the legislative council launched a [[filibuster]] campaign against the bill.

The panel reiterated their criticisms of the IPCC, while the IPCC chairman [[Anthony Neoh]] said that the suggestions by the expert panel have exceeded the \"statutory functions\" of the police watchdog.<ref name=\"rthk_1496472\"/><ref name=\"rthk_1497054\"/>\n\nThe police modified the Police General Orders by removing the sentence \"officers will be accountable for their own actions\" ahead of the 1 October confrontation. Police commanders reportedly ignored the wrongdoings and the unlawful behaviours of frontline riot police and refused to use any of the disciplinary measure to avoid upsetting them. As of December 2019, no officer has been suspended for their actions. The lack of prosecution against officers sparked fears that the police cannot be held accountable for their actions and that they are immune to any legal consequence; as of 24 December 2019, no police have been charged or prosecuted over protest-related actions.<ref name=\"WPost Police misconduct\"/>\n\n==Impacts==\n===Effects on economy===\n[[File:Hong Kong IMG 20190726 161256 (48379850001).jpg|thumb|left|Protest at the [[Hong Kong International Airport]] on 26 July 2019.]]\n\nOfficial total statistics showed that Hong Kong had slipped into recession as its economy had shrunk in the second and third quarters of 2019.<ref name=\"bi_20191029_retailersdestroyed\"/> Retail sales have declined and consumers' appetite for spending has decreased.<ref name=\"scmp_3017580\"/> During the days of protests, protesters brought \"mixed fortunes\" to the businesses according to the ''[[South China Morning Post]]''. Some restaurants saw their customers cancelling their bookings and some banks and shops were forced to shut their doors. Supplies for goods were also halted and obstructed due to the protest. Meanwhile, some shops prospered as nearby protesters bought food and other commodities.<ref name=\"scmp_3014240\"/> Due to lower consumer spending, several luxury brands delayed the opening of their shops.<ref name=scmp3038400>{{cite web|url=https://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/fashion-beauty/article/3038400/chanel-rimowa-delay-new-stores-prada-moving-out-sales|title=Chanel, Rimowa delay new stores, Prada moving out, sales plummet at Moncler, Gucci \u2013 will Hong Kong become city of 'ghost malls'?|first=Vincenzo|last=La Torre|work=[[South China Morning Post]]|date=20 November 2019|accessdate=19 February 2020}}</ref> Protest supplies such as gas masks were running low in stock in both Hong Kong and Taiwan.<ref name=\"asiatimes_20190813_gasmasks\"/>\n\nThe protests also affected property owners. Fearing the instability in Hong Kong, some investors abandoned the purchases of land. Desire to purchase properties also declined, as overall property transactions declined by 24% when compared with the Umbrella Revolution. Property developers were forced to reduce the selling price.<ref name=\"scmp_3024412\"/> Trade shows reported decreased attendance and revenue, and many firms cancelled their events in Hong Kong.<ref name=\"scmp_3037982\"/> The [[Hang Seng Index]] declined by at least 4.8% from 9 June to late August. As interest in trading waned, companies that had already applied for [[initial public offering]]s (IPO) in Hong Kong urged their bankers to put their listing on hold. August 2019 recorded only one IPO, which was the lowest since 2012, and two large IPOs were shelved respectively in June and July. [[Fitch Ratings]] downgraded Hong Kong's sovereignty rating from AA+ to AA due to doubts over the government's ability to maintain the \"one country, two systems\" principle; the outlook of the city was similarly lowered from \"stable\" to \"negative\".<ref name=\"scmp_3026109\"/>\n\nTourism was also affected. The number of visitors travelling to Hong Kong declined by 40% in August 2019 compared to August 2018,<ref name=\"reuters_20190909_40%plunge\"/> while the decline was 31.9% for the days during and after [[National Day of the People's Republic of China|National Day]].<ref name=\"cnn_20191010_holidaydip\"/> As a consequence, both the tourist sector and the food and beverage industry saw an increased unemployment rate.<ref name=\"scmp_3024412\"/><ref name=\"scmp_3034595\"/> Flight bookings also declined, with airlines cutting or reducing their services.<ref name=\"scmp_3038102\"/> During the airport protests on 12 and 13 August 2019, the [[Airport Authority Hong Kong|Airport Authority]] cancelled numerous flights, which resulted in an estimated US$76&nbsp;million loss according to aviation experts.<ref name=\"cna_11842026\"/> [[Hong Kong Disneyland]] also revealed that there were fewer guests visiting. Many mainland tourists avoided travelling to Hong Kong due to safety concerns. Various countries have since issued travel warnings to Hong Kong.<ref name=\"bbc_49276259\"/>\n\n===Effects on society===\n[[Carrie Lam as Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Lam's administration]] received criticisms for its performance during the protests. Carrie Lam's perceived arrogance,<ref name=\"standardhk_129761\"/> her extended absence, reluctance to engage in dialogue with protesters, and subpar performance at press conferences,<ref name=\"ft_20190830_policefurious\"/> were believed to have enabled the protests to escalate.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190707_missingleader\"/> At a press conference on 5 August, Lam explained her absence from the public eye in the preceding two weeks by the risks for organisers regarding possible disruption of public events and press conferences by protesters.<ref name=\"scmp_3021459\"/> According to polls conducted by the Hong Kong Public Opinion Research Institute, Lam's approval ratings declined to 22.3 in October, lowest among all chief executives, and her performance was categorised as \"disastrous\" alongside [[Secretary for Security]] [[John Lee (government official)|John Lee]] and [[Secretary for Justice (Hong Kong)|Secretary for Justice]] [[Teresa Cheng (politician)|Teresa Cheng]], prompting institute director [[Robert Chung]] to describe the situation as \"dire\".<ref name=\"hkfp_20191009_ratingplunges\"/> [[Ma Ngok]], a political scientist, remarked that the government \"has lost the trust of a whole generation\" and predicted that the youths would remain angry at both the government and the police \"for years to come\".<ref name=\"guardian_20190811_lacktrust\"/> According to ''[[The Diplomat]]'', there was also the emergence of the concept of \"mutually assured destruction\" ({{zh|labels=no|t=\u652c\u7092}}) where protesters became more radical to compel the administration to concede, while the establishment waited for their increase in aggressiveness so that they can justify the greater militarisation of the police and dismissed the protesters as \"insurgents\" and their demands.<ref name=\"diplomat_20190906_madrhetoric\"/> Rifts within the government were also formed with Lennon Walls being set up in government offices and civil servants organising rallies.<ref name=\"scmp_3020206\"/>\n\n[[File:P1120823 (49001440122).jpg|thumb|left|A riot police officer held up a blue flag warning the protesters

name=\"standardhk_132961\"/> In October, a survey conducted by CUHK revealed that more than 50% of the respondents were deeply dissatisfied with the police's performance.<ref name=\"independent_9158061\"/> According to some reports, the police's aggressive behaviours and tactics have caused them to become a symbol that represented hostility and suppression and police's actions on the protesters has resulted in a breakdown of citizens' trust towards the police.<ref name=\"aljazeera_191101070008742\"/><ref name=\"atlantic_597205\"/><ref name=\"hkfp_20180628_lostgoodwill\"/> Citizens were also concerned about the police's ability to regulate and control itself and feared about its abuse of power.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190910_offdutybatons\"/> The suspected acts of police brutality have turned some politically neutral citizens to become more sympathetic with the young protesters.<ref name=\"wsj_11567458226\"/> Fearing Hong Kong changing into a [[police state]], some citizens were actively considering emigration.<ref name=\"cnn_20191008_hkleave\"/> For the police, some lower-ranking officers reported feeling \"lost and confused\", citing \"a lack of leadership\" during important moments,<ref name=\"reuters_20190717_underpressure\"/> and was reportedly discontent with the government, as its extended absence left the police to be the only group to clash with the protesters, resulting in the two groups developing immense mutual hatred for each other.<ref name=\"ft_20190830_policefurious\"/> The police has cancelled foot patrol due to fear that they may be attacked,<ref name=\"scmp_3025140\"/> and issued extendable batons to off-duty officers.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190910_offdutybatons\"/> Frontline officers and protesters have insulted each other with degradative terms.<ref name=\"wp_20191104_insultsdangerous\"/><ref name=\"coconutshk_20190826\"/><ref name=\"scmp_3025159\"/> Police officers also reported being \"physically and mentally\" tired, as they faced the risks of being [[doxed]], [[cyberbullying|cyberbullied]], and distanced by their family members.<ref name=\"cnn_20190815_policeside\"/> The police's relations with journalists,<ref name=\"scmp_3017673\"/> social workers,<ref

strained.\n\nTo cope with the ongoing protests, on 15 November 2019, the police had appointed no more than 100 [[Correctional Services Department]] officers as special constables to assist the police force.<ref name=\"scmp_3038039\"/> Due to internal redeployment of staff within the force to deal with the protests, anti-crime operations were \"smaller and less frequent than in the past\".

The police later backed down on the claim, saying that among the protesters, only five of them rioted. Protesters have since demanded the government to fully retract the riot characterisation.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190618_backdown\"/> Lam's analogy as Hong Kong people's mother attracted criticisms after the violent crackdown on 12 June.<ref name=\"standardhk_129667\"/>\n\nLam announced the suspension of the bill on 15 June,<ref name=\"scmp_3014669\"/> and officially apologised to the public on 18 June two days after another massive march.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190618_sincereapologies\"/> In early July, Lam reiterated that the bill \"had passed away\" and reaffirmed that all efforts to amend the law had ceased, though her use of language was thought to be ambiguous.<ref name=\"guardian_20190709_deadbill\"/> During July and August, the government insisted that it would not make any concessions, and that Lam could still lead the government despite calls asking her to resign.

However, protesters and democrats had previously affirmed that all the five core demands must be answered.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190904_billwithdrawn\"/> Her concession was described as \"too little, too late\", as the conflicts would not have escalated if she had withdrawn the bill during the early stage of the protest.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190904_toolittle\" /><ref name=\"medium_20190907_govburn\"/> The first dialogue session was held on 26 September.

conference, Carrie Lam used a Cantonese phrase to say the proposed legislation was 'reaching the end of its life.' Her government suspended the progress of the bill after demonstrations last month ... 'We suspended it and we have no timetable,' Lam said. 'What I said today is not very different from before, but maybe people want to hear a very firm response ... the bill has actually died. So people won't need to worry that there will be renewed discussions on the bill in the current legislature.' Protesters rejected her remarks and promised to continue the demonstrations. Figo Chan Ho-wun of the Civil Human Rights Front said: 'I urge Carrie Lam not to use words to deceive us.

It is based on the 1958 novel [[Dr. No (novel)|of the same name]] by [[Ian Fleming]]. Starring [[Sean Connery]], [[Ursula Andress]], [[Joseph Wiseman]], and [[Jack Lord]], it is the first film in the [[List of James Bond films|''James Bond'' series]], and was adapted by [[Richard Maibaum]], [[Johanna Harwood]], and [[Berkely Mather]]. The film was produced by [[Harry Saltzman]] and [[Albert R. Broccoli]], a partnership that continued until 1975.\n\nIn the film, [[James Bond filmography|James Bond]] is sent to [[Colony of Jamaica|Jamaica]] to investigate the disappearance of a fellow British agent. The trail leads him to the underground base of [[Julius No|Dr. No]], who is plotting to disrupt an early American space launch from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station|Cape Canaveral]] with a radio beam weapon. Although it was the first of the Bond books to be made into a film, ''Dr. No'' was not the first of Fleming's novels. ''[[Casino Royale (novel)|Casino Royale]]'' was the debut for the character; however, the film makes a few references to threads from earlier books. This film makes reference to later books in the series as well, such as the criminal organisation [[SPECTRE]], which was not introduced until the 1961 novel ''[[Thunderball (novel)|Thunderball]]''.\n\nProduced on a low budget, ''Dr. No'' was a financial success. While the film received a mixed critical reaction upon release, it has gained a reputation over time as one of the series' best instalments.<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THE SPELLING OF INSTALMENTS - this is an article written in British English and retains the correct spelling --> ''Dr. No'' also launched a genre of \"secret agent\" films that flourished in the 1960s. The film also spawned a [[Dr. No (comics)|comic book adaptation]] and [[Dr. No (soundtrack)|soundtrack album]] as part of its promotion and marketing.\n\nMany of the iconic aspects of a typical James Bond film were established in ''Dr. No'': the film begins with an introduction to the character through the [[Gun barrel sequence|view of a gun barrel]] and a highly stylised main title sequence, both of which were created by [[Maurice Binder]].<ref>{{cite episode |date=2 April 2020 |title=Spies |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000gwzj |series=Mark Kermode's Secrets of Cinema |series-link=Mark Kermode's Secrets of Cinema |network=BBC |station=BBC Four |series-number=2 |number=3 |time=13:26 |access-date=3 April 2020}}</ref> It also established the iconic \"James Bond\" theme music. [[Production designer]] [[Ken Adam]] established an elaborate visual style that is one of the hallmarks of the film series.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- ATTENTION!

They steal documents related to \"Crab Key\" and \"Doctor No\". In response, [[M (James Bond)|M]], the head of MI6, instructs agent [[James Bond filmography|James Bond]] to investigate Strangways' disappearance and to determine whether it is related to his co-operation with the American [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) on a case involving the disruption of rocket launches from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station|Cape Canaveral]] by [[Radar jamming and deception|radio jamming]].\n\nOn his arrival at Kingston Airport, Bond is picked up by a chauffeur claiming to have been sent to take him to [[King's House, Jamaica|Government House]]. Bond determines him to be an enemy agent and, after having him evade a car pursuing them, bests him in a fight. Bond starts to interrogate the chauffeur, who kills himself with a [[cyanide]] capsule hidden in a cigarette.\n\nAt Strangways' house, Bond sees a photograph of a boatman with Strangways. Bond locates the boatman, named [[Quarrel (James Bond)|Quarrel]], whom he recognises as the driver of the car that followed him. Bond, after overpowering Quarrel and his friend Puss Feller, meets Quarrel's passenger, [[Felix Leiter]], a CIA agent on the same mission as Bond. The CIA has traced the radio jamming signal to Jamaica but has not determined its exact origin. Quarrel, who is assisting Leiter, reveals that he had been guiding Strangways around the nearby islands to collect mineral samples. He also mentions the reclusive Dr. No, the owner of Crab Key, an island rigorously protected against trespassers by an armed security force.\n\nIn Strangways' house, Bond finds a receipt from Professor R.J. Dent concerning rock samples. Bond meets Dent, who claims he [[wikt:assay|assayed]] the samples for Strangways and determined them to be ordinary rocks. Dent subsequently visits Dr. No, who expresses displeasure at Dent's failure to kill Bond, as well as by visiting him in daylight, and orders him to try again with a [[tarantula]], which is released into Bond's bedroom at night. Bond survives, kills the poisonous spider and sets a trap for Dent, whom he interrogates and kills.\n\nUsing a [[Geiger counter]], Bond detects [[radioactive]] traces in Quarrel's boat where Strangways' mineral samples had been. Bond convinces a reluctant Quarrel to take him to Crab Key. There Bond meets the beautiful [[Honey Rider|Honey Ryder]], dressed only in a [[White bikini of Ursula Andress|white bikini]], who is collecting shells. Ryder leads Bond and Quarrel inland to an open swamp contaminated by radiation. After nightfall, they are attacked by the \"dragon\" of Crab Key, which is, in reality, a [[flamethrower]]-equipped tank. In the resulting battle, Quarrel is incinerated and killed, while Bond and Ryder are kidnapped, decontaminated in Dr. No's lair, and rendered unconscious with drugged coffee.\n\nUpon waking, they are escorted to dine with Dr. No, a Chinese-German criminal scientist who has [[Prosthesis|prosthetic]] metal hands due to radiation exposure. He reveals that he is a former member of a Chinese crime [[Tong (organization)|Tong]], from whom he stole ten million dollars, and is now an operative of the secret organisation  [[SPECTRE]] ('''SP'''ecial '''E'''xecutive for '''C'''ounter-intelligence, '''T'''errorism, '''R'''evenge, and '''E'''xtortion), after being rejected by both the Americans and the Soviets. He plans to disrupt the [[Project Mercury]] space launch from Cape Canaveral with his radio beam. He tries to recruit Bond into SPECTRE but fails. After dinner, Ryder is taken away and Bond is beaten by the guards.\n\nBond is imprisoned in a holding cell but escapes by crawling through an air vent which is heated and then flooded. Disguising himself as a worker, he finds his way to Dr. No's control centre, which contains a nuclear [[pool reactor]]. As the American rocket lifts off, Bond overloads the reactor and knocks Dr. No into the reactor pool, killing him, as the scientist is unable to climb out due to his metal hands. Bond finds and frees Ryder, and the two escape the island in a boat as the entire lair explodes. After the boat runs out of fuel, they are rescued by Leiter, who arrives on a [[Royal Navy]] ship. As Bond and Ryder kiss, Bond lets go of the ship's tow rope.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col|colwidth=35em}}\n\n* [[Sean Connery]] as [[James Bond filmography|James Bond]], a British MI6 agent, codename 007.\n* [[Ursula Andress]] as [[Honey Ryder]], A local shell diver, making a living by selling Jamaican seashells to dealers in Miami.\n**Andress' spoken dialogue was dubbed by [[Nikki van der Zyl]]<ref name=\"Dr. No 1962 - Cast\">{{cite web|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/455547/credits.html|title=Dr. No (1962) \u2013 Cast|work=[[Screenonline]]|publisher=[[British Film Institute]]|accessdate=9 June 2011}}</ref>, and her singing voice was dubbed by [[Diana Coupland]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6136408.stm|title=Actress Diana Coupland dies at 74|date=10 November 2006|accessdate=7 June 2011|work=BBC News}}</ref> Both were uncredited.\n* [[Joseph Wiseman]] as [[Julius No|Dr. Julius No]], a reclusive member of [[SPECTRE]]\n* [[Jack Lord]] as [[Felix Leiter]], a [[CIA]] operative sent to liaise with James Bond while he is in Kingston.\n* [[Bernard Lee]] as [[M (James Bond)|M]]: The head of the British Secret Service.\n* [[Anthony Dawson]] as Professor R.J.

Instead, [[Albert R. Broccoli|Albert R. \"Cubby\" Broccoli]] wanted the rights to the novels and attempted to buy them from Saltzman. Saltzman did not want to sell the rights to Broccoli and instead, they formed a partnership to make the films. A number of Hollywood film studios did not want to fund the films, finding them \"too British\" or \"too blatantly sexual\".{{sfn|Pfeiffer|Worrall|1998|p=13}} Eventually the two received authorisation from [[United Artists]] to produce ''Dr. No'', to be released in 1962. Saltzman and Broccoli created two companies: [[Danjaq]], which was to hold the rights to the films, and [[Eon Productions]], which was to produce them.<ref name=\"Inside Dr. No documentary\"/> The partnership between Broccoli and Saltzman lasted until 1975 when tensions during the filming of ''[[The Man with the Golden Gun (film)|The Man with the Golden Gun]]'' led to an acrimonious split and Saltzman sold his shares of Danjaq to United Artists.<ref name=\"DNB: A.

They finally signed [[Terence Young (director)|Terence Young]] who had a long background with Broccoli's [[Warwick Films]] as the director. Broccoli and Saltzman felt that Young would be able to make a real impression of James Bond and transfer the essence of the character from book to film. Young imposed many stylistic choices for the character which continued throughout the film series.<ref name=\"Inside Dr. No documentary\"/> Young also decided to inject much humour, as he considered that \"a lot of things in this film, the sex, and violence, and so on if played straight, a) would be objectionable, and b) we're never gonna go past the censors; but the moment you [[Taking the piss|take the mickey out]], put the [[tongue-in-cheek|tongue out in the cheek]], it seems to disarm.\"<ref>{{cite video|last=Young|first=Terence|authorlink=Terence Young (director)|title=Audio commentary |location=Dr. No (Ultimate Edition, 2006) |year=1999|medium=DVD |publisher=[[MGM Home Entertainment]]}}</ref>\n\nThe producers asked United Artists for financing, but the studio would only put up $1 million.

My budget was \u00a314,500. I filled three stages at Pinewood full of sets while they were filming in Jamaica. It wasn't a real aquarium in Dr. No's apartment. It was a disaster to tell you the truth because we had so little money. We decided to use a rear-projection screen and get some stock footage of fish. What we didn't realise was because we didn't have much money the only stock footage they could buy was of goldfish-sized fish, so we had to blow up the size and put a line in the dialogue with Bond talking about the magnification. I didn't see any reason why Dr. No shouldn't have good taste so we mixed contemporary furniture and antiques.

Mankowitz eventually had his name removed from the credits after viewing early rushes, as he feared it would be a disaster.<ref name=\"Inside Dr. No documentary\" /> [[Johanna Harwood]] and thriller writer [[Berkely Mather]] then worked on Maibaum's script.{{sfn| McGilligan |1986|p=286}} Terence Young described Harwood as a [[script doctor]] who helped put elements more in tune with a British character.<ref name=comm/> Harwood stated in an interview in a ''Cinema Retro'' special on the making of the film that she had been a screenwriter of several of Harry Saltzman's projects; she claimed both her screenplays for ''Dr. No'' and her screenplay for ''From Russia with Love'' had followed Fleming's novels closely.<ref>''Johanna Harwood Interview'' ''Movie Classics # 4'' Solo Publishing 2012</ref>\n\nDuring the series' decades-long history only a few of the films have remained substantially true to their source material; ''Dr. No'' has many similarities to the novel and follows its basic plot, but there are a few notable omissions. Major elements from the novel that are missing from the film include Bond's fight with a [[giant squid]], and the escape from Dr. No's complex using the dragon-disguised swamp buggy. Elements of the novel that were significantly changed for the film include the use of a (non-venomous) tarantula spider instead of a [[centipede]]; Dr. No's secret complex being disguised as a [[bauxite]] mine instead of a [[guano]] quarry; Dr. No's plot to disrupt [[NASA]] space launches from Cape Canaveral using a radio beam instead of disrupting US missile testing on Turks Island; the method of Dr. No's death by boiling in overheating [[nuclear reactor|reactor]] coolant rather than a burial under a chute of guano, and the introduction of SPECTRE, an organisation absent from the book.{{sfn|Smith|2002|p=19}} Components absent from the novel but added to the film include the introduction of the Bond character in a gambling casino, the introduction of Bond's semi-regular girlfriend Sylvia Trench, a fight scene with an enemy chauffeur, a fight scene to introduce Quarrel, the seduction of Miss Taro, Bond's recurring CIA ally Felix Leiter, Dr. No's partner in crime Professor Dent and Bond's controversial cold-blooded killing of this character.{{sfn|Smith|2002|p=19}}\n\nSometimes episodes in the novel retained in the film's altered narrative introduce elements of absurdity into the plot. Bond's \"escape\" from his cell via the air shaft, for instance, originally conceived as a ruse of Dr. No's to test Bond's skill and endurance, becomes an authentic break-out in the film. Features carried over from the novel's obstacle course, however, such as the torrent of water and scalding surface, have no logical justification in the script. Such incongruities recurred in subsequent Bond films.{{sfn|Smith|2002|p=19}}\n\n=== Casting ===\n\n==== James Bond ====\nWhile producers Broccoli and Saltzman originally sought [[Cary Grant]] for the role, they discarded the idea as Grant would be committed to only one feature film, and the producers decided to go after someone who could be part of a series.<ref name=\"Inside Dr. No documentary\"/> [[Richard Johnson (actor)|Richard Johnson]] has claimed to have been the first choice of the director, but he turned it down because he already had a contract with MGM and was intending to leave.<ref>{{cite web|title=Richard Johnson Interview|url=http://www.cinemaretro.com/index.php?/archives/1524-RICHARD-JOHNSON-ON-DECLINING-THE-ROLE-OF-JAMES-BOND.html|work=[[Cinema Retro]]|accessdate=13 June 2011}}</ref> Another actor purported to have been considered for the role was [[Patrick McGoohan]] on the strength of his portrayal of spy [[John Drake (Danger Man)|John Drake]] in the television series ''[[Danger Man]]'': McGoohan turned down the role.<ref>{{cite news|last=Barker|first=Dennis|title=Obituary: Patrick McGoohan|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2009/jan/14/television2|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|location=London|date=14 January 2009}}</ref> Another potential Bond included [[David Niven]], who played the character in the 1967 parody ''[[Casino Royale (1967 film)|Casino Royale]]''.{{sfn|Macintyre|2008|p=202}}\n\nThere are several [[wikt:apocryphal|apocryphal]] stories as to whom Ian Fleming personally wanted.

While this is untrue, the contest itself did exist, and six finalists were chosen and screen-tested by Broccoli, Saltzman, and Fleming.

It is based on the 1958 novel [[Dr. No (novel)|of the same name]] by [[Ian Fleming]]. Starring [[Sean Connery]], [[Ursula Andress]], [[Joseph Wiseman]], and [[Jack Lord]], it is the first film in the [[List of James Bond films|''James Bond'' series]], and was adapted by [[Richard Maibaum]], [[Johanna Harwood]], and [[Berkely Mather]]. The film was produced by [[Harry Saltzman]] and [[Albert R. Broccoli]], a partnership that continued until 1975.\n\nIn the film, [[James Bond filmography|James Bond]] is sent to [[Colony of Jamaica|Jamaica]] to investigate the disappearance of a fellow British agent. The trail leads him to the underground base of [[Julius No|Dr. No]], who is plotting to disrupt an early American space launch from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station|Cape Canaveral]] with a radio beam weapon. Although it was the first of the Bond books to be made into a film, ''Dr. No'' was not the first of Fleming's novels. ''[[Casino Royale (novel)|Casino Royale]]'' was the debut for the character; however, the film makes a few references to threads from earlier books. This film makes reference to later books in the series as well, such as the criminal organisation [[SPECTRE]], which was not introduced until the 1961 novel ''[[Thunderball (novel)|Thunderball]]''.\n\nProduced on a low budget, ''Dr. No'' was a financial success. While the film received a mixed critical reaction upon release, it has gained a reputation over time as one of the series' best instalments.<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THE SPELLING OF INSTALMENTS - this is an article written in British English and retains the correct spelling --> ''Dr. No'' also launched a genre of \"secret agent\" films that flourished in the 1960s. The film also spawned a [[Dr. No (comics)|comic book adaptation]] and [[Dr. No (soundtrack)|soundtrack album]] as part of its promotion and marketing.\n\nMany of the iconic aspects of a typical James Bond film were established in ''Dr. No'': the film begins with an introduction to the character through the [[Gun barrel sequence|view of a gun barrel]] and a highly stylised main title sequence, both of which were created by [[Maurice Binder]].<ref>{{cite episode |date=2 April 2020 |title=Spies |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000gwzj |series=Mark Kermode's Secrets of Cinema |series-link=Mark Kermode's Secrets of Cinema |network=BBC |station=BBC Four |series-number=2 |number=3 |time=13:26 |access-date=3 April 2020}}</ref> It also established the iconic \"James Bond\" theme music. [[Production designer]] [[Ken Adam]] established an elaborate visual style that is one of the hallmarks of the film series.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- ATTENTION!

They steal documents related to \"Crab Key\" and \"Doctor No\". In response, [[M (James Bond)|M]], the head of MI6, instructs agent [[James Bond filmography|James Bond]] to investigate Strangways' disappearance and to determine whether it is related to his co-operation with the American [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) on a case involving the disruption of rocket launches from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station|Cape Canaveral]] by [[Radar jamming and deception|radio jamming]].\n\nOn his arrival at Kingston Airport, Bond is picked up by a chauffeur claiming to have been sent to take him to [[King's House, Jamaica|Government House]]. Bond determines him to be an enemy agent and, after having him evade a car pursuing them, bests him in a fight. Bond starts to interrogate the chauffeur, who kills himself with a [[cyanide]] capsule hidden in a cigarette.\n\nAt Strangways' house, Bond sees a photograph of a boatman with Strangways. Bond locates the boatman, named [[Quarrel (James Bond)|Quarrel]], whom he recognises as the driver of the car that followed him. Bond, after overpowering Quarrel and his friend Puss Feller, meets Quarrel's passenger, [[Felix Leiter]], a CIA agent on the same mission as Bond. The CIA has traced the radio jamming signal to Jamaica but has not determined its exact origin. Quarrel, who is assisting Leiter, reveals that he had been guiding Strangways around the nearby islands to collect mineral samples. He also mentions the reclusive Dr. No, the owner of Crab Key, an island rigorously protected against trespassers by an armed security force.\n\nIn Strangways' house, Bond finds a receipt from Professor R.J. Dent concerning rock samples. Bond meets Dent, who claims he [[wikt:assay|assayed]] the samples for Strangways and determined them to be ordinary rocks. Dent subsequently visits Dr. No, who expresses displeasure at Dent's failure to kill Bond, as well as by visiting him in daylight, and orders him to try again with a [[tarantula]], which is released into Bond's bedroom at night. Bond survives, kills the poisonous spider and sets a trap for Dent, whom he interrogates and kills.\n\nUsing a [[Geiger counter]], Bond detects [[radioactive]] traces in Quarrel's boat where Strangways' mineral samples had been. Bond convinces a reluctant Quarrel to take him to Crab Key. There Bond meets the beautiful [[Honey Rider|Honey Ryder]], dressed only in a [[White bikini of Ursula Andress|white bikini]], who is collecting shells. Ryder leads Bond and Quarrel inland to an open swamp contaminated by radiation. After nightfall, they are attacked by the \"dragon\" of Crab Key, which is, in reality, a [[flamethrower]]-equipped tank. In the resulting battle, Quarrel is incinerated and killed, while Bond and Ryder are kidnapped, decontaminated in Dr. No's lair, and rendered unconscious with drugged coffee.\n\nUpon waking, they are escorted to dine with Dr. No, a Chinese-German criminal scientist who has [[Prosthesis|prosthetic]] metal hands due to radiation exposure. He reveals that he is a former member of a Chinese crime [[Tong (organization)|Tong]], from whom he stole ten million dollars, and is now an operative of the secret organisation  [[SPECTRE]] ('''SP'''ecial '''E'''xecutive for '''C'''ounter-intelligence, '''T'''errorism, '''R'''evenge, and '''E'''xtortion), after being rejected by both the Americans and the Soviets. He plans to disrupt the [[Project Mercury]] space launch from Cape Canaveral with his radio beam. He tries to recruit Bond into SPECTRE but fails. After dinner, Ryder is taken away and Bond is beaten by the guards.\n\nBond is imprisoned in a holding cell but escapes by crawling through an air vent which is heated and then flooded. Disguising himself as a worker, he finds his way to Dr. No's control centre, which contains a nuclear [[pool reactor]]. As the American rocket lifts off, Bond overloads the reactor and knocks Dr. No into the reactor pool, killing him, as the scientist is unable to climb out due to his metal hands. Bond finds and frees Ryder, and the two escape the island in a boat as the entire lair explodes. After the boat runs out of fuel, they are rescued by Leiter, who arrives on a [[Royal Navy]] ship. As Bond and Ryder kiss, Bond lets go of the ship's tow rope.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col|colwidth=35em}}\n\n* [[Sean Connery]] as [[James Bond filmography|James Bond]], a British MI6 agent, codename 007.\n* [[Ursula Andress]] as [[Honey Ryder]], A local shell diver, making a living by selling Jamaican seashells to dealers in Miami.\n**Andress' spoken dialogue was dubbed by [[Nikki van der Zyl]]<ref name=\"Dr. No 1962 - Cast\">{{cite web|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/455547/credits.html|title=Dr. No (1962) \u2013 Cast|work=[[Screenonline]]|publisher=[[British Film Institute]]|accessdate=9 June 2011}}</ref>, and her singing voice was dubbed by [[Diana Coupland]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6136408.stm|title=Actress Diana Coupland dies at 74|date=10 November 2006|accessdate=7 June 2011|work=BBC News}}</ref> Both were uncredited.\n* [[Joseph Wiseman]] as [[Julius No|Dr. Julius No]], a reclusive member of [[SPECTRE]]\n* [[Jack Lord]] as [[Felix Leiter]], a [[CIA]] operative sent to liaise with James Bond while he is in Kingston.\n* [[Bernard Lee]] as [[M (James Bond)|M]]: The head of the British Secret Service.\n* [[Anthony Dawson]] as Professor R.J.

[[Milton Reid]], who would later starred in [[The Spy Who Loved Me (film)|''The Spy Who Loved Me'']], appears as one of Dr. No's guards.\n\n== Production ==\nWhen [[Harry Saltzman]] gained the rights for the novel, he initially did not go through with the project. Instead, [[Albert R. Broccoli|Albert R. \"Cubby\" Broccoli]] wanted the rights to the novels and attempted to buy them from Saltzman. Saltzman did not want to sell the rights to Broccoli and instead, they formed a partnership to make the films. A number of Hollywood film studios did not want to fund the films, finding them \"too British\" or \"too blatantly sexual\".{{sfn|Pfeiffer|Worrall|1998|p=13}} Eventually the two received authorisation from [[United Artists]] to produce ''Dr. No'', to be released in 1962. Saltzman and Broccoli created two companies: [[Danjaq]], which was to hold the rights to the films, and [[Eon Productions]], which was to produce them.<ref name=\"Inside Dr. No documentary\"/> The partnership between Broccoli and Saltzman lasted until 1975 when tensions during the filming of ''[[The Man with the Golden Gun (film)|The Man with the Golden Gun]]'' led to an acrimonious split and Saltzman sold his shares of Danjaq to United Artists.<ref name=\"DNB: A.

They finally signed [[Terence Young (director)|Terence Young]] who had a long background with Broccoli's [[Warwick Films]] as the director. Broccoli and Saltzman felt that Young would be able to make a real impression of James Bond and transfer the essence of the character from book to film. Young imposed many stylistic choices for the character which continued throughout the film series.<ref name=\"Inside Dr. No documentary\"/> Young also decided to inject much humour, as he considered that \"a lot of things in this film, the sex, and violence, and so on if played straight, a) would be objectionable, and b) we're never gonna go past the censors; but the moment you [[Taking the piss|take the mickey out]], put the [[tongue-in-cheek|tongue out in the cheek]], it seems to disarm.\"<ref>{{cite video|last=Young|first=Terence|authorlink=Terence Young (director)|title=Audio commentary |location=Dr. No (Ultimate Edition, 2006) |year=1999|medium=DVD |publisher=[[MGM Home Entertainment]]}}</ref>\n\nThe producers asked United Artists for financing, but the studio would only put up $1 million. Later, the UK arm of United Artists provided an extra $100,000 to create the climax where Dr. No's base explodes.<ref name=\"comm\"/> As a result of the low budget, only one [[Sound editor (filmmaking)|sound editor]] was hired (normally there are two, for sound effects and dialogue),<ref>{{cite video|people=Wanstall, Norman |title=Audio commentary|location=Dr. No (Ultimate Edition, 2006)|year=1999 |medium=DVD |publisher=[[MGM Home Entertainment]]}}</ref> and many pieces of scenery were made in cheaper ways, with M's office featuring cardboard paintings and a door covered in a leather-like plastic, the room where Dent meets Dr. No costing only \u00a3745 to build,<ref>{{cite video|authorlink=Ken Adam|last=Adam|first=Ken|title=Audio commentary|location=Dr. No (Ultimate Edition, 2006)|year=1999|medium=DVD |publisher=[[MGM Home Entertainment]]}}</ref> and the aquarium in Dr. No's base being magnified stock footage of goldfish.<ref name=drill/> Furthermore, when art director [[Syd Cain]] found out his name was not in the credits, Broccoli gave him a golden pen to compensate, saying that he did not want to spend money making the credits again.<ref>{{cite video|authorlink=Syd Cain|last=Cain|first=Syd|title=Audio commentary|location=From Russia With Love (Ultimate Edition, 2006)|year=1999|medium=DVD |publisher=[[MGM Home Entertainment]]}}</ref> Production designer [[Ken Adam]] later told UK daily newspaper ''[[The Guardian]]'' in 2005: \n\n<blockquote>The budget for ''Dr No'' was under $1m for the whole picture. My budget was \u00a314,500. I filled three stages at Pinewood full of sets while they were filming in Jamaica. It wasn't a real aquarium in Dr. No's apartment. It was a disaster to tell you the truth because we had so little money. We decided to use a rear-projection screen and get some stock footage of fish. What we didn't realise was because we didn't have much money the only stock footage they could buy was of goldfish-sized fish, so we had to blow up the size and put a line in the dialogue with Bond talking about the magnification. I didn't see any reason why Dr. No shouldn't have good taste so we mixed contemporary furniture and antiques. We thought it would be fun for him to have some stolen art so we used Goya's [[Portrait of the Duke of Wellington]], which was still missing at the time. I got hold of a slide from the National Gallery - this was on the Friday, shooting began on the Monday - and I painted a Goya over the weekend. It was pretty good so they used it for publicity purposes but, just like the real one, it got stolen while it was on display.<ref name=\"The Guardian 17 September 2005\">{{cite news |last= Dee |first= Johnny |title= Licensed to drill |url= https://www.theguardian.com/film/2005/sep/17/culture.features| date= 17 September 2005 |newspaper= [[The Guardian]] |location=London| accessdate=10 March 2016 }}</ref></blockquote>\n\n=== Writing ===\nBroccoli had originally hired [[Richard Maibaum]] and his friend [[Wolf Mankowitz]] to write ''Dr. No''{{'}}s screenplay, partly because of Mankowitz's help in brokering the deal between Broccoli and Saltzman.{{Sfn|Broccoli|1998|p=158}} An initial draft of the screenplay was rejected because the scriptwriters had made the villain, Dr. No, a monkey.{{Sfn|Broccoli|1998|p=159}}{{sfn|Smith|2002|p=19}} Mankowitz left the film, and Maibaum then undertook a second version of the story, more closely in line with the novel.

Major elements from the novel that are missing from the film include Bond's fight with a [[giant squid]], and the escape from Dr. No's complex using the dragon-disguised swamp buggy. Elements of the novel that were significantly changed for the film include the use of a (non-venomous) tarantula spider instead of a [[centipede]]; Dr. No's secret complex being disguised as a [[bauxite]] mine instead of a [[guano]] quarry; Dr. No's plot to disrupt [[NASA]] space launches from Cape Canaveral using a radio beam instead of disrupting US missile testing on Turks Island; the method of Dr. No's death by boiling in overheating [[nuclear reactor|reactor]] coolant rather than a burial under a chute of guano, and the introduction of SPECTRE, an organisation absent from the book.{{sfn|Smith|2002|p=19}} Components absent from the novel but added to the film include the introduction of the Bond character in a gambling casino, the introduction of Bond's semi-regular girlfriend Sylvia Trench, a fight scene with an enemy chauffeur, a fight scene to introduce Quarrel, the seduction of Miss Taro, Bond's recurring CIA ally Felix Leiter, Dr. No's partner in crime Professor Dent and Bond's controversial cold-blooded killing of this character.{{sfn|Smith|2002|p=19}}\n\nSometimes episodes in the novel retained in the film's altered narrative introduce elements of absurdity into the plot. Bond's \"escape\" from his cell via the air shaft, for instance, originally conceived as a ruse of Dr. No's to test Bond's skill and endurance, becomes an authentic break-out in the film. Features carried over from the novel's obstacle course, however, such as the torrent of water and scalding surface, have no logical justification in the script. Such incongruities recurred in subsequent Bond films.{{sfn|Smith|2002|p=19}}\n\n=== Casting ===\n\n==== James Bond ====\nWhile producers Broccoli and Saltzman originally sought [[Cary Grant]] for the role, they discarded the idea as Grant would be committed to only one feature film, and the producers decided to go after someone who could be part of a series.<ref name=\"Inside Dr. No documentary\"/> [[Richard Johnson (actor)|Richard Johnson]] has claimed to have been the first choice of the director, but he turned it down because he already had a contract with MGM and was intending to leave.<ref>{{cite web|title=Richard Johnson Interview|url=http://www.cinemaretro.com/index.php?/archives/1524-RICHARD-JOHNSON-ON-DECLINING-THE-ROLE-OF-JAMES-BOND.html|work=[[Cinema Retro]]|accessdate=13 June 2011}}</ref> Another actor purported to have been considered for the role was [[Patrick McGoohan]] on the strength of his portrayal of spy [[John Drake (Danger Man)|John Drake]] in the television series ''[[Danger Man]]'': McGoohan turned down the role.<ref>{{cite news|last=Barker|first=Dennis|title=Obituary: Patrick McGoohan|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2009/jan/14/television2|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|location=London|date=14 January 2009}}</ref> Another potential Bond included [[David Niven]], who played the character in the 1967 parody ''[[Casino Royale (1967 film)|Casino Royale]]''.{{sfn|Macintyre|2008|p=202}}\n\nThere are several [[wikt:apocryphal|apocryphal]] stories as to whom Ian Fleming personally wanted.

His work is held in museum collections worldwide and he has twice been named a [[Turner Prize]] nominee. Moving from London to New York in 1975, Scully helped lead the transition from [[Minimalism (visual arts)|Minimalism]] to [[Emotional abstraction]] in painting, abandoning the reduced vocabulary of Minimalism in favor of a return to metaphor and spirituality in art.\n\nScully has also been a lecturer and professor at a number of universities and is highly regarded for his writing and teachings, collected in the 2016 book, ''Inner: The Collected Writings and Selected Interviews of Sean Scully.''\n\n==Early life==\nSean Scully was born in Dublin, Ireland in 1945.

During the summer of that year, Scully started producing small multi-panel works on found pieces of wood while staying in [[Montauk, New York|Montauk]] at the Edward Albee artist\u2019s colony. These works were titled ''Ridge'', ''Plum'', and ''Bear'' after the islands that surround Long Island. He also began applying a combination of rigid geometry and expressive texture and color to larger paintings that year. A prime example of this was ''Heart of Darkness'', inspired by the [[Heart of Darkness|1899 novella of the same name]].<ref name=\":2\" /> Scully began collaborating with Mohammad O. Khalil in 1983, this was the first time he had collaborated with a printmaker and was the start of a career-long commitment to [[printmaking]].\n\nIn 1984, the [[Museum of Modern Art]] included Scully in their International Survey of Recent Painting and Sculpture. The following year Scully\u2019s first American solo museum exhibition was held at the Museum of Art, [[Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh|Carnegie Institute]] in 1985, and traveled to the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]]. Other major museums also began to acquire Scully\u2019s large-scale paintings, despite the dominant trend of the time tending towards [[Postmodernism]]. Scully\u2019s paintings from this period are heavy and physical in terms of both size and aesthetic, and make use of large-scale stretchers.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Bl9DLQ3a8t4C&pg=PA157&dq=sean+scully#v=onepage&q=sean%20scully&f=false|title=Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth|last3=Auping|first3=Michael|last4=Karnes|first4=Andrea|last5=Thistlethwaite|first5=Mark Edward|date=2002|publisher=Third Millennium Information Ltd|isbn=978-1-903942-14-7|location=|pages=157|language=en}}</ref>\n\nBy 1987, Scully's work became less complex, flatter and smaller in scale, and began to include lighter color palettes beginning with ''Pale Fire'' in 1988. The same year, while experimenting with watercolors on a beach in Mexico, Scully created the first image that would become an extended meditation on architecture and light with the ''Wall of Light'' series.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=sPGdBxzaWj0C&lpg=RA3-PA405&dq=sean%20scully%20ikon&pg=RA3-PA405#v=onepage&q=sean%20scully%20ikon&f=false|title=The Grove Encyclopedia of American Art|last=Marter|first=Joan M.|date=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-533579-8|language=en}}</ref> In 1989 the [[Whitechapel Gallery]] in London held a solo exhibition for Scully, which then traveled to Palacio Vel\u00e1zquez in Madrid and to the [[St\u00e4dtische Galerie im Lenbachhaus]] in Munich.

By 1991 Scully expanded the use of steel, setting oil on linen insets into large steel panels. He also began the regular use of a checkerboard motif at this time, first hinted at in his ''Taped and Hidden Drawing'' paintings of the mid 1970s. In 1992, while teaching at Harvard University, Sean Scully revisited Morocco to film the BBC documentary ''The Artist's Journey: Sean Scully on Henri Matisse'', with [[Henri Matisse|Matisse]] having visited Morocco in 1912 - 1913. 1993 saw the first exhibition of ''The Catherine Paintings'', at the [[Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth]], Texas.

His work is held in museum collections worldwide and he has twice been named a [[Turner Prize]] nominee. Moving from London to New York in 1975, Scully helped lead the transition from [[Minimalism (visual arts)|Minimalism]] to [[Emotional abstraction]] in painting, abandoning the reduced vocabulary of Minimalism in favor of a return to metaphor and spirituality in art.\n\nScully has also been a lecturer and professor at a number of universities and is highly regarded for his writing and teachings, collected in the 2016 book, ''Inner: The Collected Writings and Selected Interviews of Sean Scully.''\n\n==Early life==\nSean Scully was born in Dublin, Ireland in 1945.

During the summer of that year, Scully started producing small multi-panel works on found pieces of wood while staying in [[Montauk, New York|Montauk]] at the Edward Albee artist\u2019s colony. These works were titled ''Ridge'', ''Plum'', and ''Bear'' after the islands that surround Long Island. He also began applying a combination of rigid geometry and expressive texture and color to larger paintings that year. A prime example of this was ''Heart of Darkness'', inspired by the [[Heart of Darkness|1899 novella of the same name]].<ref name=\":2\" /> Scully began collaborating with Mohammad O. Khalil in 1983, this was the first time he had collaborated with a printmaker and was the start of a career-long commitment to [[printmaking]].\n\nIn 1984, the [[Museum of Modern Art]] included Scully in their International Survey of Recent Painting and Sculpture. The following year Scully\u2019s first American solo museum exhibition was held at the Museum of Art, [[Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh|Carnegie Institute]] in 1985, and traveled to the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]]. Other major museums also began to acquire Scully\u2019s large-scale paintings, despite the dominant trend of the time tending towards [[Postmodernism]].

In 1992, while teaching at Harvard University, Sean Scully revisited Morocco to film the BBC documentary ''The Artist's Journey: Sean Scully on Henri Matisse'', with [[Henri Matisse|Matisse]] having visited Morocco in 1912 - 1913. 1993 saw the first exhibition of ''The Catherine Paintings'', at the [[Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth]], Texas. In 1994 he opened a second studio in [[Barcelona]], and he returned to Morocco in 1995, to spend more time in the country.

He visited [[Santo Domingo]] in 1999, resulting in the photography portfolio ''Santa Domingo for Nen\u00e9''. That year, Scully\u2019s prints were given a retrospective at the [[Graphische Sammlung Albertina]], in Vienna, Austria, and the Mus\u00e9e du Dessin et de l\u2019Estampe Originale in [[Gravelines]].

Furthermore, the Constitution provides that each original state is entitled to at least six Senators. However, neither of these provisions applies to any newly admitted states, or to territories. Pursuant to an Act of Parliament passed in 1973, Senators are elected to represent the territories.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/sota1973408/ |title=Senate (Representation of Territories) Act 1973.

This number increased to ten from the [[1949 Australian federal election|1949 election]], and was increased again to twelve from the [[1984 Australian federal election|1984 election]]. The system for electing Senators has changed several times since [[Federation of Australia|Federation]]. The original arrangement used a [[first-past-the-post voting|first-past-the-post]] [[Plurality-at-large voting|block voting]] or \"winner takes all\" system, on a state-by-state basis. This was replaced in 1919 by [[preferential block voting]]. Block voting tended to produce [[Landslide victory|landslide]] majorities and even \"wipe-outs\". For instance, from 1920 to 1923 the [[Nationalist Party (Australia)|Nationalist Party]] had 35 of the 36 Senators, and from 1947 to 1950, the [[Australian Labor Party]] had 33 of the 36 Senators.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Sawer, Marian |author2=Miskin, Sarah |lastauthoramp=yes | title =Papers on Parliament No. 34 Representation and Institutional Change: 50 Years of Proportional Representation in the Senate | publisher = Department of the Senate | year = 1999 | url = http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Senate/Powers_practice_n_procedures/pops/pop34 | id = | isbn = 0-642-71061-9 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1948, [[single transferable vote]] [[proportional representation]] on a state-by-state basis became the method for electing Senators.

If the previous Senator was a member of a particular political party the replacement must come from the same party, but the State Parliament may choose not to fill the vacancy, in which case Section 11 requires the Senate to proceed regardless. If the State Parliament happens to be in recess when the vacancy occurs, the Constitution provides that the State Governor can appoint someone to fill the place until fourteen days after the State Parliament resumes sitting. The State Parliament can also be recalled to ratify a replacement.\n\n===House of Representatives===\n[[File:2016-ballot-paper-Higgins.png|thumb|right|2016 House of Representatives ballot paper used in the [[Division of Higgins]]]]\nThe lower house of the Australian Parliament, the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], is made up of single member electorates with roughly the same population. As is convention in the [[Westminster system]], the party or coalition of parties that has the majority in this House forms the Government with the leader of that party or coalition becoming the Prime Minister. If the government loses the confidence of the House, they are expected to call a new election or resign.\n\nParliament may determine the number of members of the House of Representatives but the Constitution provides that this number must be \"as nearly as practicable, twice the number of Senators\"; this requirement is commonly called the \"nexus provision\". Hence, the House presently consists of 150 members. Each state is allocated seats based on its population; however, each original state, regardless of size, is guaranteed at least five seats. The Constitution does not guarantee representation for the territories. Parliament granted a seat to the [[Northern Territory]] in 1922, and to the Australian Capital Territory in 1948; these territorial representatives, however, had only limited voting rights until 1968.<ref>{{cite web|title=Northern Territory Representation Act 1922 |work=Documenting a Democracy |url=http://www.foundingdocs.gov.au/item-sdid-63.html |accessdate=22 March 2017}}</ref> Federal electorates have their boundaries redrawn or redistributed whenever a state or territory has its number of seats adjusted, if electorates are not generally matched by population size or if seven years have passed since the most recent redistribution.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/rp/rp1617/Redist45thParl |title=Electoral Redistributions during the 45th Parliament |author=Barber, Stephen |date=25 August 2016 |accessdate=22 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1901 to 1949, the House consisted of either 74 or 75 members (the Senate had 36).

Compulsory voting was not on the platform of either the [[Stanley Bruce]]-led Nationalist/Country party coalition government or the [[Matthew Charlton]]-led Labor opposition. The actual initiative for change was made by [[Herbert Payne]], a backbench Tasmanian [[Nationalist Party (Australia)|Nationalist]] Senator who on 16 July 1924 introduced a [[private member's bill|private Senator's bill]] in the Senate.

The presiding officer of the Senate is called the [[President of the Senate (Australia)|President]]; that of the House of Representatives is the [[Speaker of the Australian House of Representatives|Speaker]].

The quorum of the Senate is one-quarter of the total membership (nineteen); that of the House of Representatives is one-fifth of the total membership (thirty). In theory, if a quorum is not present, then a House may not continue to meet. In practice, members usually agree not to notice that a quorum is not present, so that debates on routine bills can continue without other members having to be present.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}} Sometimes the Opposition will \"[[quorum call|call a quorum]]\" as a tactic to annoy the Government or delay proceedings, particularly when the Opposition feels it has been unfairly treated in the House. The session of the relevant House is suspended until a quorum is present.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}} It is the responsibility of the Government [[whip (politics)|whips]] to ensure that, when a quorum is called, enough Government members are present to make up a quorum.\n\nBoth Houses may determine motions by [[voice vote]]: the presiding officer puts the question, and, after listening to shouts of \"Aye\" and \"No\" from the members, announces the result. The announcement of the presiding officer settles the question, unless at least two members demand a \"[[Division of the assembly|division]]\", or a recorded vote. In that case the bells are rung throughout Parliament House summoning Senators or Members to the chamber. During a division, members who favour the motion move to the right side of the chamber, whereas those opposed move to the left. They are then counted by the \"tellers\" (Government and Opposition whips), and the motion is passed or defeated accordingly. In the Senate, in order not to deprive a state of a vote in what is supposed to be a states' house, the President is permitted a vote along with other Senators (however, that right is rarely exercised); in the case of a tie, the President does not have a casting vote and the motion fails.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Senate/Powers_practice_n_procedures/Senate_Briefs/Brief06 |title=Senate Brief \u2013 No. 6 \u2013 The President of the Senate|work=Department of the Senate |accessdate=29 March 2017}}</ref> In the House of Representatives, the Speaker does not vote, except in the case of a tie (see [[casting vote]]).<ref name=spe />\n\nMost legislation is introduced into the House of Representatives and goes through a number of stages to become a law.

This is followed by a consideration in detail stage, where the House can explore the bill in detail and make any amendments. This is finally followed by a [[third reading]], where the bill is either passed or rejected by the House. If passed, the legislation is then sent to the Senate, which has a similar structure of debate and passage except that the consideration in detail stage is replaced by a [[committee of the whole]].

The Governor-General appoints as [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] the leader of the party that has a majority of seats in or control of the House of Representatives and the Ministers are then appointed by the Governor-General as had been designated by the Prime Minister from his or her party or coalition of parties.\n\nThese ministers then meet in a council known as [[Cabinet of Australia|Cabinet]]. Cabinet meetings are strictly private and occur once a week where vital issues are discussed and policy formulated. The Constitution does not recognise the Cabinet as a legal entity; it exists solely by convention. Its decisions do not in and of themselves have legal force. However, it serves as the practical expression of the [[Federal Executive Council (Australia)|Federal Executive Council]], which is Australia's highest formal governmental body.<ref name=Handbook>{{cite web|title=Federal Executive Council Handbook|url=https://www.dpmc.gov.au/resource-centre/government/federal-executive-council-handbook-2017 |publisher=Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet|accessdate=3 March 2017}}</ref> In practice, the Federal Executive Council meets solely to endorse and give legal force to decisions already made by the Cabinet. All members of the Cabinet are members of the Executive Council. While the Governor-General is nominal presiding officer, she or he almost never attends Executive Council meetings.

From a comparative governmental perspective, the Australian Senate exhibits distinctive characteristics. Unlike upper Houses in other [[Westminster system]] governments, the Senate is not a vestigial body with limited legislative power. Rather it was intended to play \u2013 and does play \u2013 an active role in legislation. Rather than being modelled solely after the [[House of Lords]], as the [[Senate of Canada|Canadian Senate]] was, the Australian Senate was in part modelled after the [[United States Senate]], by giving equal representation to each state. The Constitution intended to give less populous states added voice in a Federal legislature, while also providing for the revising role of an upper house in the Westminster system.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Senate/Powers_practice_n_procedures/Odgers_Australian_Senate_Practice/Chapter_01#h02 |title=Odgers' Australian Senate Practice Fourteenth Edition Chapter 1 \u2013 The Senate and its constitutional role \u2013 The Senate, bicameralism and federalism|year=2017 |accessdate=17 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nOne of the functions of the Senate, both directly and through its committees, is to scrutinise government activity. The vigour of this scrutiny has been fuelled for many years by the fact that the party in government has seldom had a majority in the Senate. Whereas in the House of Representatives the government's majority has sometimes limited that chamber's capacity to implement executive scrutiny, the opposition and minor parties have been able to use their Senate numbers as a basis for conducting inquiries into government operations.<ref>{{cite book| last = Bach| first = Stanley| authorlink =| title = Platypus and Parliament: The Australian Senate in Theory and Practice | publisher = Department of the Senate| year = 2003| url =http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Senate/Powers_practice_n_procedures/platparl| pp = 352| isbn = 0-642-71291-3}}</ref>\n\nThe constitutional text denies the Senate the power to originate or amend appropriation bills, in deference to the conventions of the classical Westminster system. Under a traditional Westminster system, the executive government is responsible for its use of public funds to the lower house, which has the power to bring down a government by [[Loss of supply|blocking its access to supply]] \u2013 i.e. [[revenue]] appropriated through taxation. The arrangement as expressed in the Australian Constitution, however, still leaves the Senate with the power to reject supply bills or defer their passage \u2013 undoubtedly one of the Senate's most powerful abilities.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Senate/Powers_practice_n_procedures/Odgers_Australian_Senate_Practice/Chapter_01#h08 |title=Odgers' Australian Senate Practice Fourteenth Edition Chapter 1 \u2013 The Senate and its constitutional role \u2013 Legislative powers|year=2017 |accessdate=17 March 2017}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|text=Because of the federal nature of our Constitution and because of its provisions the Senate undoubtedly has constitutional power to refuse or defer supply to the Government. Because of the principles of responsible government a Prime Minister who cannot obtain supply, including money for carrying on the ordinary services of government, must either advise a general election or resign. If he refuses to do this I have the authority and indeed the duty under the Constitution to withdraw his Commission as Prime Minister. The position in Australia is quite different from a position in the United Kingdom. Here the confidence of both Houses on supply is necessary to ensure its provision. In United Kingdom the confidence of the House of Commons alone is necessary. But both here and in the United Kingdom the duty of the Prime Minister is the same in a most important aspect \u2013 if he cannot get supply he must resign or advise an election.|author=Governor-General [[John Kerr (governor-general)|Sir John Kerr]]|source=Statement (dated 11 November 1975)<ref name=kerr>{{cite web|last1=Kerr|first1=John|title=Statement from John Kerr (dated 11 November 1975) explaining his decisions.|url=http://whitlamdismissal.com/documents/kerr-statement.shtml|website=WhitlamDismissal.com|accessdate=11 January 2017}}</ref>}}\n\nThe ability to block supply was the origin of the [[1975 Australian constitutional crisis]]. The [[Parliamentary opposition|Opposition]] used its numbers in the Senate to defer supply bills, refusing to deal with them until an election was called for both Houses of Parliament, an election which it hoped to win. The [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] of the day, [[Gough Whitlam]], contested the legitimacy of the blocking and refused to resign. The crisis brought to a head two Westminster conventions that, under the Australian constitutional system, were in conflict \u2013 firstly, that a government may continue to govern for as long as it has the support of the [[lower house]], and secondly, that a government that no longer has access to supply must either resign or be dismissed. The crisis was resolved in November 1975 when Governor-General [[John Kerr (governor-general)|Sir John Kerr]] dismissed Whitlam's government and appointed a caretaker government on condition that elections for both Houses of parliament be held.<ref name=kerr/> This action in itself was a source of controversy and debate continues on the proper usage of the Senate's ability to block supply and on whether such a power should even exist.<ref>{{cite book| last = Bach| first = Stanley| authorlink =| title = Platypus and Parliament: The Australian Senate in Theory and Practice | publisher = Department of the Senate| year = 2003| url =http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Senate/Powers_practice_n_procedures/platparl| pp = 300| isbn = 0-642-71291-3}}</ref>\n\nThe blocking of supply alone cannot force a double dissolution.

The proceedings of parliamentary committees, wherever they meet, are also covered by privilege, and this extends to witnesses before such committees.\n\nFrom the beginning of Federation until 1987, Parliamentary privilege operated under Section 49 of the Constitution, which established the privileges of both Houses and their members to be the same as the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]] at the time of the Constitution's enactment. The Parliament was also given the power to amend its privileges.<ref name=\"con49\"/> In 1987, the Parliament passed the \"Parliamentary Privileges Act\", which clarified the meaning and extent of privilege as well as how the Parliament deals with breaches.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Senate/Powers_practice_n_procedures/Odgers_Australian_Senate_Practice/Chapter_02 |title=Odgers' Australian Senate Practice Fourteenth Edition Chapter 2 \u2013 Parliamentary privilege: immunities and powers of the Senate|year=2017 |accessdate=19 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nThere is a legal offence called [[contempt of Parliament]].

In the meantime, [[John Smith Murdoch]], the Commonwealth's Chief Architect, worked on the design as part of his official duties.

The opening ceremonies were both splendid and incongruous, given the sparsely built nature of Canberra of the time and its small population. The building was extensively decorated with British Empire and Australian flags and bunting. Temporary stands were erected bordering the lawns in front of the Parliament and these were filled with crowds.

Furthermore, the Constitution provides that each original state is entitled to at least six Senators. However, neither of these provisions applies to any newly admitted states, or to territories. Pursuant to an Act of Parliament passed in 1973, Senators are elected to represent the territories.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/sota1973408/ |title=Senate (Representation of Territories) Act 1973.

This number increased to ten from the [[1949 Australian federal election|1949 election]], and was increased again to twelve from the [[1984 Australian federal election|1984 election]]. The system for electing Senators has changed several times since [[Federation of Australia|Federation]]. The original arrangement used a [[first-past-the-post voting|first-past-the-post]] [[Plurality-at-large voting|block voting]] or \"winner takes all\" system, on a state-by-state basis. This was replaced in 1919 by [[preferential block voting]]. Block voting tended to produce [[Landslide victory|landslide]] majorities and even \"wipe-outs\". For instance, from 1920 to 1923 the [[Nationalist Party (Australia)|Nationalist Party]] had 35 of the 36 Senators, and from 1947 to 1950, the [[Australian Labor Party]] had 33 of the 36 Senators.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Sawer, Marian |author2=Miskin, Sarah |lastauthoramp=yes | title =Papers on Parliament No. 34 Representation and Institutional Change: 50 Years of Proportional Representation in the Senate | publisher = Department of the Senate | year = 1999 | url = http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Senate/Powers_practice_n_procedures/pops/pop34 | id = | isbn = 0-642-71061-9 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1948, [[single transferable vote]] [[proportional representation]] on a state-by-state basis became the method for electing Senators.

If the previous Senator was a member of a particular political party the replacement must come from the same party, but the State Parliament may choose not to fill the vacancy, in which case Section 11 requires the Senate to proceed regardless. If the State Parliament happens to be in recess when the vacancy occurs, the Constitution provides that the State Governor can appoint someone to fill the place until fourteen days after the State Parliament resumes sitting. The State Parliament can also be recalled to ratify a replacement.\n\n===House of Representatives===\n[[File:2016-ballot-paper-Higgins.png|thumb|right|2016 House of Representatives ballot paper used in the [[Division of Higgins]]]]\nThe lower house of the Australian Parliament, the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], is made up of single member electorates with roughly the same population. As is convention in the [[Westminster system]], the party or coalition of parties that has the majority in this House forms the Government with the leader of that party or coalition becoming the Prime Minister. If the government loses the confidence of the House, they are expected to call a new election or resign.\n\nParliament may determine the number of members of the House of Representatives but the Constitution provides that this number must be \"as nearly as practicable, twice the number of Senators\"; this requirement is commonly called the \"nexus provision\". Hence, the House presently consists of 150 members. Each state is allocated seats based on its population; however, each original state, regardless of size, is guaranteed at least five seats. The Constitution does not guarantee representation for the territories. Parliament granted a seat to the [[Northern Territory]] in 1922, and to the Australian Capital Territory in 1948; these territorial representatives, however, had only limited voting rights until 1968.<ref>{{cite web|title=Northern Territory Representation Act 1922 |work=Documenting a Democracy |url=http://www.foundingdocs.gov.au/item-sdid-63.html |accessdate=22 March 2017}}</ref> Federal electorates have their boundaries redrawn or redistributed whenever a state or territory has its number of seats adjusted, if electorates are not generally matched by population size or if seven years have passed since the most recent redistribution.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/rp/rp1617/Redist45thParl |title=Electoral Redistributions during the 45th Parliament |author=Barber, Stephen |date=25 August 2016 |accessdate=22 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1901 to 1949, the House consisted of either 74 or 75 members (the Senate had 36).

The immediate justification for compulsory voting was the low voter turnout (59.38%) at the [[1922 Australian federal election|1922 federal election]], down from 71.59% at the [[1919 Australian federal election|1919 federal election]]. Compulsory voting was not on the platform of either the [[Stanley Bruce]]-led Nationalist/Country party coalition government or the [[Matthew Charlton]]-led Labor opposition. The actual initiative for change was made by [[Herbert Payne]], a backbench Tasmanian [[Nationalist Party (Australia)|Nationalist]] Senator who on 16 July 1924 introduced a [[private member's bill|private Senator's bill]] in the Senate. Payne's bill was passed with little debate (the House of Representatives agreeing to it in less than an hour), and in neither house was a division required, hence no votes were recorded against the bill.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mind-trek.com/writ-dtf/votehoax/c-puplic.htm |title=\"The case for compulsory voting\"; by Chris Puplick |publisher=Mind-trek.com |date=30 June 1997 |accessdate=16 June 2010}}</ref> The [[1925 Australian federal election|1925 federal election]] was the first to be conducted under compulsory voting, which saw the turnout figure rise to 91.4%.

The presiding officer of the Senate is called the [[President of the Senate (Australia)|President]]; that of the House of Representatives is the [[Speaker of the Australian House of Representatives|Speaker]]. Elections for these positions are by secret ballot. Both offices are conventionally filled by members of the governing party, but the presiding officers are expected to oversee debate and enforce the rules in an impartial manner.<ref name=spe>{{cite web |url=http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/House_of_Representatives/Powers_practice_and_procedure/Practice6/Practice6HTML?file=Chapter6 |title=House of Representatives Practice, 6th Ed \u2013 Chapter 6 \u2013 The Speaker, Deputy Speakers and officers |year=2015 |accessdate=23 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe Constitution authorises Parliament to set the [[quorum]] for each chamber. The quorum of the Senate is one-quarter of the total membership (nineteen); that of the House of Representatives is one-fifth of the total membership (thirty). In theory, if a quorum is not present, then a House may not continue to meet. In practice, members usually agree not to notice that a quorum is not present, so that debates on routine bills can continue without other members having to be present.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}} Sometimes the Opposition will \"[[quorum call|call a quorum]]\" as a tactic to annoy the Government or delay proceedings, particularly when the Opposition feels it has been unfairly treated in the House. The session of the relevant House is suspended until a quorum is present.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}} It is the responsibility of the Government [[whip (politics)|whips]] to ensure that, when a quorum is called, enough Government members are present to make up a quorum.\n\nBoth Houses may determine motions by [[voice vote]]: the presiding officer puts the question, and, after listening to shouts of \"Aye\" and \"No\" from the members, announces the result. The announcement of the presiding officer settles the question, unless at least two members demand a \"[[Division of the assembly|division]]\", or a recorded vote. In that case the bells are rung throughout Parliament House summoning Senators or Members to the chamber. During a division, members who favour the motion move to the right side of the chamber, whereas those opposed move to the left. They are then counted by the \"tellers\" (Government and Opposition whips), and the motion is passed or defeated accordingly. In the Senate, in order not to deprive a state of a vote in what is supposed to be a states' house, the President is permitted a vote along with other Senators (however, that right is rarely exercised); in the case of a tie, the President does not have a casting vote and the motion fails.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Senate/Powers_practice_n_procedures/Senate_Briefs/Brief06 |title=Senate Brief \u2013 No. 6 \u2013 The President of the Senate|work=Department of the Senate |accessdate=29 March 2017}}</ref> In the House of Representatives, the Speaker does not vote, except in the case of a tie (see [[casting vote]]).<ref name=spe />\n\nMost legislation is introduced into the House of Representatives and goes through a number of stages to become a law.

The legislation can then be considered by a House committee, which reports back to the House on any recommendations. This is followed by a consideration in detail stage, where the House can explore the bill in detail and make any amendments. This is finally followed by a [[third reading]], where the bill is either passed or rejected by the House. If passed, the legislation is then sent to the Senate, which has a similar structure of debate and passage except that the consideration in detail stage is replaced by a [[committee of the whole]]. Once a bill has been passed by both Houses in the same form, it is then presented to the Governor-General for [[royal assent]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.peo.gov.au/uploads/peo/docs/fact-sheets/making_law.pdf |title=Fact Sheet \u2013 Making a Law |work=Parliamentary Education Office |accessdate=23 March 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Functions==\n[[File:Constitution of Australia.jpg|left|thumb|The [[Constitution of Australia]], where the functions and powers of Parliament are outlined]]\nThe principal function of the Parliament is to pass laws, or legislation.

Because all seats are contested in the same election, it is easier for smaller parties to win seats under the single transferable vote system: the [[Election threshold|quota]] for the election of each senator in each Australian state in a full Senate election is 7.69% of the vote, while in a normal half-Senate election the quota is 14.28%.<ref>{{cite web |first= Damon |last= Muller| url=http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/FlagPost/2016/April/Double_Dissolutions |title=FlagPost \u2013 (Almost) everything you need to know about double dissolution elections|publisher=Australian Parliamentary Library|year=2016 |accessdate=29 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nIf the conflict continues after such an election, the Governor-General may convene a [[Joint Sitting of the Australian Parliament of 1974|joint sitting of both Houses]] to consider the bill or bills, including any amendments which have been previously proposed in either House, or any new amendments. If a bill is passed by an [[absolute majority]] of the total membership of the joint sitting, it is treated as though it had been passed separately by both Houses, and is presented for royal assent. With proportional representation, and the small majorities in the Senate compared to the generally larger majorities in the House of Representatives, and the requirement that the number of members of the House be \"nearly as practicable\" twice that of the Senate, a joint sitting after a double dissolution is more likely than not to lead to a victory for the House over the Senate. This provision has only been invoked on one occasion, after the [[1974 Australian federal election|election]] following the 1974 double dissolution.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/House_of_Representatives/Powers_practice_and_procedure/Practice6/Practice6HTML?file=Chapter13&section=04 |title=House of Representatives Practice, 6th Ed \u2013 Chapter 13 \u2013 Disagreements between the Houses \u2013 JOINT SITTING |year=2015 |accessdate=3 March 2017}}</ref> However, there are other occasions when the two Houses meet as one: see [[Joint meetings of the Australian Parliament]].\n\n==Committees==\n{{see also|Australian Senate committees|Australian House of Representatives committees}}\n[[Image:AustralianSenateCommitteeRm.JPG|thumb|left|A Senate committee room in Parliament House, Canberra]]\n[[File:Australian Parliament Parliamentary Committees.webm|thumb|A short video on Australian Parliamentary Committees]]\nIn addition to the work of the main chambers, both the Senate and the House of Representatives also have a large number of committees which deal with matters referred to them by their respective Houses.

There are a number of ways that witnesses can be found in contempt, these include; refusing to appear before a committee when summoned, refusing to answer a question during a hearing or to produce a document, or later being found to have lied to or misled a committee.

Cabinet meetings are strictly private and occur once a week where vital issues are discussed and policy formulated. The Constitution does not recognise the Cabinet as a legal entity; it exists solely by convention. Its decisions do not in and of themselves have legal force.

From a comparative governmental perspective, the Australian Senate exhibits distinctive characteristics. Unlike upper Houses in other [[Westminster system]] governments, the Senate is not a vestigial body with limited legislative power. Rather it was intended to play \u2013 and does play \u2013 an active role in legislation. Rather than being modelled solely after the [[House of Lords]], as the [[Senate of Canada|Canadian Senate]] was, the Australian Senate was in part modelled after the [[United States Senate]], by giving equal representation to each state. The Constitution intended to give less populous states added voice in a Federal legislature, while also providing for the revising role of an upper house in the Westminster system.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Senate/Powers_practice_n_procedures/Odgers_Australian_Senate_Practice/Chapter_01#h02 |title=Odgers' Australian Senate Practice Fourteenth Edition Chapter 1 \u2013 The Senate and its constitutional role \u2013 The Senate, bicameralism and federalism|year=2017 |accessdate=17 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nOne of the functions of the Senate, both directly and through its committees, is to scrutinise government activity. The vigour of this scrutiny has been fuelled for many years by the fact that the party in government has seldom had a majority in the Senate. Whereas in the House of Representatives the government's majority has sometimes limited that chamber's capacity to implement executive scrutiny, the opposition and minor parties have been able to use their Senate numbers as a basis for conducting inquiries into government operations.<ref>{{cite book| last = Bach| first = Stanley| authorlink =| title = Platypus and Parliament: The Australian Senate in Theory and Practice | publisher = Department of the Senate| year = 2003| url =http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Senate/Powers_practice_n_procedures/platparl| pp = 352| isbn = 0-642-71291-3}}</ref>\n\nThe constitutional text denies the Senate the power to originate or amend appropriation bills, in deference to the conventions of the classical Westminster system. Under a traditional Westminster system, the executive government is responsible for its use of public funds to the lower house, which has the power to bring down a government by [[Loss of supply|blocking its access to supply]] \u2013 i.e. [[revenue]] appropriated through taxation. The arrangement as expressed in the Australian Constitution, however, still leaves the Senate with the power to reject supply bills or defer their passage \u2013 undoubtedly one of the Senate's most powerful abilities.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Senate/Powers_practice_n_procedures/Odgers_Australian_Senate_Practice/Chapter_01#h08 |title=Odgers' Australian Senate Practice Fourteenth Edition Chapter 1 \u2013 The Senate and its constitutional role \u2013 Legislative powers|year=2017 |accessdate=17 March 2017}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|text=Because of the federal nature of our Constitution and because of its provisions the Senate undoubtedly has constitutional power to refuse or defer supply to the Government. Because of the principles of responsible government a Prime Minister who cannot obtain supply, including money for carrying on the ordinary services of government, must either advise a general election or resign. If he refuses to do this I have the authority and indeed the duty under the Constitution to withdraw his Commission as Prime Minister. The position in Australia is quite different from a position in the United Kingdom. Here the confidence of both Houses on supply is necessary to ensure its provision. In United Kingdom the confidence of the House of Commons alone is necessary. But both here and in the United Kingdom the duty of the Prime Minister is the same in a most important aspect \u2013 if he cannot get supply he must resign or advise an election.|author=Governor-General [[John Kerr (governor-general)|Sir John Kerr]]|source=Statement (dated 11 November 1975)<ref name=kerr>{{cite web|last1=Kerr|first1=John|title=Statement from John Kerr (dated 11 November 1975) explaining his decisions.|url=http://whitlamdismissal.com/documents/kerr-statement.shtml|website=WhitlamDismissal.com|accessdate=11 January 2017}}</ref>}}\n\nThe ability to block supply was the origin of the [[1975 Australian constitutional crisis]]. The [[Parliamentary opposition|Opposition]] used its numbers in the Senate to defer supply bills, refusing to deal with them until an election was called for both Houses of Parliament, an election which it hoped to win. The [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] of the day, [[Gough Whitlam]], contested the legitimacy of the blocking and refused to resign. The crisis brought to a head two Westminster conventions that, under the Australian constitutional system, were in conflict \u2013 firstly, that a government may continue to govern for as long as it has the support of the [[lower house]], and secondly, that a government that no longer has access to supply must either resign or be dismissed. The crisis was resolved in November 1975 when Governor-General [[John Kerr (governor-general)|Sir John Kerr]] dismissed Whitlam's government and appointed a caretaker government on condition that elections for both Houses of parliament be held.<ref name=kerr/> This action in itself was a source of controversy and debate continues on the proper usage of the Senate's ability to block supply and on whether such a power should even exist.<ref>{{cite book| last = Bach| first = Stanley| authorlink =| title = Platypus and Parliament: The Australian Senate in Theory and Practice | publisher = Department of the Senate| year = 2003| url =http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Senate/Powers_practice_n_procedures/platparl| pp = 300| isbn = 0-642-71291-3}}</ref>\n\nThe blocking of supply alone cannot force a double dissolution.
