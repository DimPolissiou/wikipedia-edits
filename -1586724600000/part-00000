It mainly consists of archive footage, with Curtis narrating. The series was originally broadcast in the United Kingdom in 2004.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/cc3b6876ce754703b8db7fe6731a4943|title=The Power of Nightmares: 1/3: Baby It's Cold Outside |date=14 October 2004|work=[[BBC Genome]] |publisher=BBC |accessdate=19 October 2015}}</ref> It has subsequently been aired in multiple countries and shown at various film festivals, including the [[2005 Cannes Film Festival]].\n\nThe film compares the rise of the [[Neoconservatism|neoconservative]] movement in the United States and the [[Islamist terrorism|radical]] [[Islamism|Islamist]] movement, drawing comparisons between their origins, and remarking on similarities between the two groups. More controversially, it argues that radical [[Islamism]] as a massive, sinister organisation, specifically in the form of [[al-Qaeda]], is a myth, or [[noble lie]], perpetuated by leaders of many countries\u2014and particularly neoconservatives in the U.S.\u2014in a renewed attempt to unite and inspire their people after the ultimate failure of [[utopia]]n ideas.\n\n''The Power of Nightmares'' was praised by film critics in Britain and the United States. Its message and content have also been the subject of various critiques and criticisms from [[conservatism|conservatives]] and [[progressivism|progressives]].\n\n== Synopsis ==\n\n=== Part 1. \"Baby It's Cold Outside\" ===\nThe first part of the series explains the origins of [[Islamism]] and [[neoconservatism]]. It shows [[Egypt]]ian civil servant [[Sayyid Qutb]], depicted as the founder of modern Islamist thinking, visiting the U.S. to learn about its education system, then becoming disgusted at what he judged as the corruption of morals and virtues in [[Western world|western society]] through [[individualism]]. When he returns to Egypt, he is disturbed by [[westernization|westernisation]] under [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] and becomes convinced that in order to save his own society, it must be completely restructured along the lines of [[Sharia|Islamic law]] while still using western [[technology]]. He then becomes convinced that his vision can only be accomplished through use of an elite \"vanguard\" to lead a revolution against the established order. Qutb becomes a leader of the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] and, after being tortured in one of Nasser's jails, comes to believe that western-influenced leaders can be justifiably killed to remove their corruption. Qutb is [[Death penalty|executed]] in 1966, but he influences [[Ayman al-Zawahiri]], the future mentor of [[Osama bin Laden]], to start his own secret Islamist group. Inspired by the [[1979 Iranian revolution]], Zawahiri and his allies [[Assassination|assassinate]] Egyptian president [[Anwar Al-Sadat]] in 1981 in the hopes of starting their own revolution. However, the revolution does not materialise, and Zawahiri comes to believe that a majority of Muslims have been corrupted, not only by their western-inspired leaders, but Muslims themselves have been affected by [[jahilliyah]] and thus may be legitimate targets of violence if they refuse to join his cause. They continued to believe that a vanguard was necessary to rise up and overthrow the corrupt regime and replace it with a 'pure' Islamist state.\n\nAt the same time in the [[United States]], a group of disillusioned liberals, including [[Irving Kristol]] and [[Paul Wolfowitz]], look to the political thinking of [[Leo Strauss]] after the perceived failure of [[Lyndon Johnson|President Johnson's]] \"[[Great Society]]\". They conclude that an emphasis on individual liberty was the undoing of Johnson's plans. They envisioned restructuring America by uniting the American people against a common evil, and set about creating a mythical enemy. These factions, the neoconservatives, came to power during the 1980s under the [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] administration, with their allies [[Dick Cheney]] and [[Donald Rumsfeld]]. They alleged that the Soviet Union was not following the terms of a disarmament treaty between the two countries, and together with the outcomes of \"[[Team B]]\", they built a case using dubious evidence and methods to prove it to Ronald Reagan.\n\n=== Part 2. \"The Phantom Victory\" ===\nIn the second part, Islamist factions, rapidly falling under the more radical influence of Zawahiri and his rich [[Saudi Arabia|Saudi]] acolyte [[Osama bin Laden]], join the neoconservative-influenced Reagan administration to combat the [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War|Soviet Union's invasion]] of [[Afghanistan]]. When the Soviets eventually pull out of Afghanistan, and when the [[Eastern Bloc]] [[Revolutions of 1989|begins to collapse]] in 1989, both the Islamists and the neoconservatives believe they are the primary architects of the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|Soviet Union's demise]]. Curtis argues that the Soviet Union was on the verge of collapsing anyway. However, the Islamists see it quite differently. In their triumph, they believe they have the power to create 'pure' Islamic states in Egypt and [[Algeria]]. Attempts to create such Islamic states are blocked by force. The Islamists then try to foment revolutions in Egypt and Algeria by using terrorism to scare the people into rising up against their leaders. But the people are terrified by the violence, and the Algerian government exploits that fear as a way to hang on to power. In the end, the Islamists declare the entire populations of the countries to be thoroughly contaminated by western values. Finally, in Algeria, they begin to turn on each other, each believing that members of other terrorist groups are not true Muslims.\n\nIn America, neoconservative aspirations to use the United States' military power to further destroy evildoers are thrown off track by the election of [[George H. W. Bush]] to the [[President of the United States|presidency]], followed by the election in 1992 of [[Bill Clinton]] which left them totally out of power. The neoconservatives, along with their [[Christian right|conservative Christian]] allies, attempt to demonize Clinton throughout his presidency with various real and fabricated stories of corruption and immorality. To their disappointment, the American people do not turn against Clinton. Meanwhile, Islamist attempts at revolution end in massive bloodshed, leaving the Islamists without popular support. Zawahiri and bin Laden flee to the relative safety of [[Afghanistan]] and declare a new strategy. To fight Western-inspired moral decay, they must deal a blow to its source: the United States.\n\n=== Part 3. \"The Shadows in the Cave\" ===\n[[File:National Park Service 9-11 Statue of Liberty and WTC fire.jpg|thumb|200px|The neoconservatives use the [[September 11 attacks|11 September attacks]], with al-Fadl's description of al-Qaeda, to launch the [[War on Terror]].]]\nThe final part addresses the actual rise of [[al-Qaeda]]. Curtis argues that, after their failed revolutions, bin Laden and Zawahiri had little or no popular support, let alone a serious complex organisation of terrorists, and were dependent on independent operatives to carry out their new call for [[jihad]]. However, the film argues that in order to prosecute bin Laden [[trial in absentia|''in absentia'']] for the [[1998 U.S. embassy bombings]], U.S. prosecutors had to prove that he is the head of a criminal organisation responsible for the bombings. They find a former associate of bin Laden, [[Jamal al-Fadl]], and pay him to testify that bin Laden is the head of a massive terrorist organisation called \"al-Qaeda\". With the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11 attacks]], neoconservatives in the new [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] administration of [[George W. Bush]] use this invented concept of an organisation to justify another crusade against a new enemy, culminating in the launch of the [[War on Terror]].\n\nAfter the [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|American invasion of Afghanistan]] fails to uproot the alleged terrorist organisation, the Bush administration focuses inwards, searching unsuccessfully for terrorist [[sleeper cell]]s in America. In 2003, they extend the War on Terror to a war on general perceived evils with the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion of Iraq]]. The ideas and tactics also spread to the United Kingdom, where [[Tony Blair]] uses the threat of terrorism to give him a new [[moral authority]]. The repercussions of the neoconservative strategy are also explored, with an investigation of indefinitely-detained terrorist suspects in [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp|Guantanamo Bay]], many allegedly taken on the word of the anti-[[Taliban]] [[United Islamic Front for the Salvation of Afghanistan|Northern Alliance]] without actual investigation on the part of the United States military, and other forms of \"[[Preemptive war|preemption]]\" against non-existent and unlikely threats made simply on the grounds that the parties involved had the potential to become a threat. Curtis specifically attempts to allay fears of a [[dirty bomb]] attack, and concludes by reassuring viewers that politicians will eventually have to concede that some threats are exaggerated and others have no foundation in reality. He says, \"In an age when all the grand ideas have lost credibility, fear of a phantom enemy is all the politicians have left to maintain their power.\"\n\n==Contributors==\n{{Columns-list|colwidth=20em|\n* [[John Calvert (scholar)|John Calvert]], historian of Islamism\n* Prof. [[Harvey Mansfield]], Straussian philosopher, [[Harvard University]]\n* Prof. [[Stanley Rosen]], pupil of [[Leo Strauss]], 1949\n* [[Azzam Tamimi|Dr Azzam Tamimi]], Institute of Islamic Political Thought\n* General Fouad Allam, interrogator, Interior Ministry 1958\u201387\n* Roxanne Euben, political scientist\n* [[Irving Kristol]], American journalist\n* [[William Kristol]], Chief of Staff to the Vice President 1988\u201392\n* Prof. [[Stephen Holmes (academic)|Stephen Holmes]], political philosopher\n* [[Henry Kissinger]] (interviewed 1975)\n* [[Melvin Goodman]], Head of Office, Soviet Affairs, CIA 1976\u201387\n* Prof. [[Richard Pipes]], adviser to President Reagan 1980\u201383\n* [[Anne Hessing Cahn|Dr Anne Cahn]], [[Arms Control and Disarmament Agency]] 1977\u201380\n* Omar Azzam, cousin of [[Ayman al-Zawahiri]], Egyptian al-Qaeda leader\n* [[Kamal Habib|Dr Kamal Habib]], founder member of Islamic Jihad\n* [[Gilles Kepel]], historian of Islamist Movement\n* [[Paul Weyrich]], religious activist; member of Republican Party\n* [[Michael Ledeen]], Special Adviser to the US Secretary of State 1981\u201382\n* [[John P.

It mainly consists of archive footage, with Curtis narrating. The series was originally broadcast in the United Kingdom in 2004.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/cc3b6876ce754703b8db7fe6731a4943|title=The Power of Nightmares: 1/3: Baby It's Cold Outside |date=14 October 2004|work=[[BBC Genome]] |publisher=BBC |accessdate=19 October 2015}}</ref> It has subsequently been aired in multiple countries and shown at various film festivals, including the [[2005 Cannes Film Festival]].\n\nThe film compares the rise of the [[Neoconservatism|neoconservative]] movement in the United States and the [[Islamist terrorism|radical]] [[Islamism|Islamist]] movement, drawing comparisons between their origins, and remarking on similarities between the two groups. More controversially, it argues that radical [[Islamism]] as a massive, sinister organisation, specifically in the form of [[al-Qaeda]], is a myth, or [[noble lie]], perpetuated by leaders of many countries\u2014and particularly neoconservatives in the U.S.\u2014in a renewed attempt to unite and inspire their people after the ultimate failure of [[utopia]]n ideas.\n\n''The Power of Nightmares'' was praised by film critics in Britain and the United States. Its message and content have also been the subject of various critiques and criticisms from [[conservatism|conservatives]] and [[progressivism|progressives]].\n\n== Synopsis ==\n\n=== Part 1. \"Baby It's Cold Outside\" ===\nThe first part of the series explains the origins of [[Islamism]] and [[neoconservatism]]. It shows [[Egypt]]ian civil servant [[Sayyid Qutb]], depicted as the founder of modern Islamist thinking, visiting the U.S. to learn about its education system, then becoming disgusted at what he judged as the corruption of morals and virtues in [[Western world|western society]] through [[individualism]]. When he returns to Egypt, he is disturbed by [[westernization|westernisation]] under [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] and becomes convinced that in order to save his own society, it must be completely restructured along the lines of [[Sharia|Islamic law]] while still using western [[technology]]. He then becomes convinced that his vision can only be accomplished through use of an elite \"vanguard\" to lead a revolution against the established order. Qutb becomes a leader of the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] and, after being tortured in one of Nasser's jails, comes to believe that western-influenced leaders can be justifiably killed to remove their corruption. Qutb is [[Death penalty|executed]] in 1966, but he influences [[Ayman al-Zawahiri]], the future mentor of [[Osama bin Laden]], to start his own secret Islamist group. Inspired by the [[1979 Iranian revolution]], Zawahiri and his allies [[Assassination|assassinate]] Egyptian president [[Anwar Al-Sadat]] in 1981 in the hopes of starting their own revolution. However, the revolution does not materialise, and Zawahiri comes to believe that a majority of Muslims have been corrupted, not only by their western-inspired leaders, but Muslims themselves have been affected by [[jahilliyah]] and thus may be legitimate targets of violence if they refuse to join his cause. They continued to believe that a vanguard was necessary to rise up and overthrow the corrupt regime and replace it with a 'pure' Islamist state.\n\nAt the same time in the [[United States]], a group of disillusioned liberals, including [[Irving Kristol]] and [[Paul Wolfowitz]], look to the political thinking of [[Leo Strauss]] after the perceived failure of [[Lyndon Johnson|President Johnson's]] \"[[Great Society]]\". They conclude that an emphasis on individual liberty was the undoing of Johnson's plans. They envisioned restructuring America by uniting the American people against a common evil, and set about creating a mythical enemy. These factions, the neoconservatives, came to power during the 1980s under the [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] administration, with their allies [[Dick Cheney]] and [[Donald Rumsfeld]]. They alleged that the Soviet Union was not following the terms of a disarmament treaty between the two countries, and together with the outcomes of \"[[Team B]]\", they built a case using dubious evidence and methods to prove it to Ronald Reagan.\n\n=== Part 2. \"The Phantom Victory\" ===\nIn the second part, Islamist factions, rapidly falling under the more radical influence of Zawahiri and his rich [[Saudi Arabia|Saudi]] acolyte [[Osama bin Laden]], join the neoconservative-influenced Reagan administration to combat the [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War|Soviet Union's invasion]] of [[Afghanistan]]. When the Soviets eventually pull out of Afghanistan, and when the [[Eastern Bloc]] [[Revolutions of 1989|begins to collapse]] in 1989, both the Islamists and the neoconservatives believe they are the primary architects of the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|Soviet Union's demise]]. Curtis argues that the Soviet Union was on the verge of collapsing anyway. However, the Islamists see it quite differently. In their triumph, they believe they have the power to create 'pure' Islamic states in Egypt and [[Algeria]]. Attempts to create such Islamic states are blocked by force. The Islamists then try to foment revolutions in Egypt and Algeria by using terrorism to scare the people into rising up against their leaders. But the people are terrified by the violence, and the Algerian government exploits that fear as a way to hang on to power. In the end, the Islamists declare the entire populations of the countries to be thoroughly contaminated by western values. Finally, in Algeria, they begin to turn on each other, each believing that members of other terrorist groups are not true Muslims.\n\nIn America, neoconservative aspirations to use the United States' military power to further destroy evildoers are thrown off track by the election of [[George H. W. Bush]] to the [[President of the United States|presidency]], followed by the election in 1992 of [[Bill Clinton]] which left them totally out of power. The neoconservatives, along with their [[Christian right|conservative Christian]] allies, attempt to demonize Clinton throughout his presidency with various real and fabricated stories of corruption and immorality. To their disappointment, the American people do not turn against Clinton. Meanwhile, Islamist attempts at revolution end in massive bloodshed, leaving the Islamists without popular support. Zawahiri and bin Laden flee to the relative safety of [[Afghanistan]] and declare a new strategy. To fight Western-inspired moral decay, they must deal a blow to its source: the United States.\n\n=== Part 3. \"The Shadows in the Cave\" ===\n[[File:National Park Service 9-11 Statue of Liberty and WTC fire.jpg|thumb|200px|The neoconservatives use the [[September 11 attacks|11 September attacks]], with al-Fadl's description of al-Qaeda, to launch the [[War on Terror]].]]\nThe final part addresses the actual rise of [[al-Qaeda]]. Curtis argues that, after their failed revolutions, bin Laden and Zawahiri had little or no popular support, let alone a serious complex organisation of terrorists, and were dependent on independent operatives to carry out their new call for [[jihad]]. However, the film argues that in order to prosecute bin Laden [[trial in absentia|''in absentia'']] for the [[1998 U.S. embassy bombings]], U.S. prosecutors had to prove that he is the head of a criminal organisation responsible for the bombings. They find a former associate of bin Laden, [[Jamal al-Fadl]], and pay him to testify that bin Laden is the head of a massive terrorist organisation called \"al-Qaeda\". With the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11 attacks]], neoconservatives in the new [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] administration of [[George W. Bush]] use this invented concept of an organisation to justify another crusade against a new enemy, culminating in the launch of the [[War on Terror]].\n\nAfter the [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|American invasion of Afghanistan]] fails to uproot the alleged terrorist organisation, the Bush administration focuses inwards, searching unsuccessfully for terrorist [[sleeper cell]]s in America. In 2003, they extend the War on Terror to a war on general perceived evils with the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion of Iraq]]. The ideas and tactics also spread to the United Kingdom, where [[Tony Blair]] uses the threat of terrorism to give him a new [[moral authority]]. The repercussions of the neoconservative strategy are also explored, with an investigation of indefinitely-detained terrorist suspects in [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp|Guantanamo Bay]], many allegedly taken on the word of the anti-[[Taliban]] [[United Islamic Front for the Salvation of Afghanistan|Northern Alliance]] without actual investigation on the part of the United States military, and other forms of \"[[Preemptive war|preemption]]\" against non-existent and unlikely threats made simply on the grounds that the parties involved had the potential to become a threat. Curtis specifically attempts to allay fears of a [[dirty bomb]] attack, and concludes by reassuring viewers that politicians will eventually have to concede that some threats are exaggerated and others have no foundation in reality. He says, \"In an age when all the grand ideas have lost credibility, fear of a phantom enemy is all the politicians have left to maintain their power.\"\n\n==Contributors==\n{{Columns-list|colwidth=20em|\n* [[John Calvert (scholar)|John Calvert]], historian of Islamism\n* Prof. [[Harvey Mansfield]], Straussian philosopher, [[Harvard University]]\n* Prof. [[Stanley Rosen]], pupil of [[Leo Strauss]], 1949\n* [[Azzam Tamimi|Dr Azzam Tamimi]], Institute of Islamic Political Thought\n* General Fouad Allam, interrogator, Interior Ministry 1958\u201387\n* Roxanne Euben, political scientist\n* [[Irving Kristol]], American journalist\n* [[William Kristol]], Chief of Staff to the Vice President 1988\u201392\n* Prof. [[Stephen Holmes (academic)|Stephen Holmes]], political philosopher\n* [[Henry Kissinger]] (interviewed 1975)\n* [[Melvin Goodman]], Head of Office, Soviet Affairs, CIA 1976\u201387\n* Prof. [[Richard Pipes]], adviser to President Reagan 1980\u201383\n* [[Anne Hessing Cahn|Dr Anne Cahn]], [[Arms Control and Disarmament Agency]] 1977\u201380\n* Omar Azzam, cousin of [[Ayman al-Zawahiri]], Egyptian al-Qaeda leader\n* [[Kamal Habib|Dr Kamal Habib]], founder member of Islamic Jihad\n* [[Gilles Kepel]], historian of Islamist Movement\n* [[Paul Weyrich]], religious activist; member of Republican Party\n* [[Michael Ledeen]], Special Adviser to the US Secretary of State 1981\u201382\n* [[John P.

[[Jason Burke]], author of ''[[Al-Qaeda: Casting a Shadow of Terror]]'', comments in ''The Shadows in the Cave'' on the failure to expose a massive terrorist network in Afghanistan. Additional interviews with major figures are added to drive the film's narrative. Neoconservatives [[William Kristol|William]] and [[Irving Kristol]], [[Richard Pipes]], [[Richard Perle]] and [[Michael Ledeen]] are invited to provide a neoconservative view of the film's subject. The history of Islamism is discussed by the Institute of Islamic Political Thought's [[Azzam Tamimi]], political scientist Roxanne Euben, and Islamist [[Abdullah Anas]].\n\nThe film's soundtrack includes at least two pieces of music from the films of [[John Carpenter]], who Curtis credited as inspiration for his soundtrack arrangement techniques,<ref name=\"GC\"/> as well as tracks from [[Brian Eno]]'s ''[[Another Green World]]''.

Accessed October 26, 2007.</ref> a village near [[Pe\u0107]], at the time part of the [[Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo|Kosovo-Metohija Province]] of [[PR Serbia]], [[FPR Yugoslavia]].\n\n==Military career==\nAfter Agim \u00c7eku finished the secondary military school in [[Belgrade]], he attended the [[Zadar]] Military Academy. Shortly afterwards, he joined the [[Yugoslav People's Army]] (JNA) as an artillery captain. In 1991 the [[Yugoslav wars]] broke out and he deserted from the JNA and joined the [[Croatian National Guard]] (which transformed into the Croatian Army), when the Republic of Croatia [[Croatian War of Independence|fought a war]] in [[Breakup of Yugoslavia|breaking away]] from Yugoslavia. The Croatian Army fought the Serb breakaway [[Republic of Serbian Krajina]]. He participated in several military operations, he first was in [[Operation Maslenica]] when he was the head of [[Velebit]]'s artillery section, from January to February 1993, [[Operation Medak pocket]] near Gospi\u0107, in which he was wounded, and [[Operation Storm]] in August 1995 that captured most of the Krajina territory. Subsequently, he continued the advance as head of Croatian forces into the Republic of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] fighting in western Bosnia against the forces of the [[Republika Srpska|Serb Republic]] in [[Operation Maestral]].\n\nAfter the war the Croatian Army was reformed and President [[Franjo Tu\u0111man]] named \u00c7eku commanding officer of the Fifth District Region in [[Rijeka]]. In 1998 he filed a request for retirement in order to go to Kosovo to join the ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) that fought Serbian rule, which was officially fulfilled in February 1999 with his resignation.\n\n==Kosovo War==\n\u00c7eku had developed contacts with the KLA in the mid-1990s. When war broke out in Kosovo, the KLA initially did very badly against the Yugoslav forces, due in part to poor leadership under senior commander [[Sylejman Selimi]], a militarily inexperienced individual who had been given the post largely because of his influence in the [[Drenica]] region (the KLA's heartland).\n\nIn May 1999, \u00c7eku was appointed the KLA's chief of staff, replacing Selimi. He immediately set about reorganising the KLA and implementing a proper military structure within the organization. In the closing days of the Kosovo War, the KLA began providing systematic intelligence to [[NATO]] as well as mounting attacks to lure Serbian forces into the open, enabling NATO warplanes to bomb them. According to reports at the time, \u00c7eku was the principal liaison between NATO and the KLA.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}\n\n==Kosovo Protection Corps==\nFollowing the end of the war in June 1999, \u00c7eku oversaw the demilitarisation of the KLA and its transformation into the [[Kosovo Protection Corps]] (KPC), an ostensibly civilian organization charged with disaster response, demining, search and response and humanitarian projects.  Although the international community insisted the KPC was a civilian organization, \u00c7eku and its membership said they believed the KPC should evolve into the future army of an independent Kosovo.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} \u00c7eku managed ably many difficult challenges for the KPC, including allegations that its members were supporting the [[2001 insurgency in the Republic of Macedonia|ethnic Albanian insurgency in Macedonia in 2001]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}\n\n==Political career==\nOn 10 March 2006, \u00c7eku was elected [[Prime Minister of Kosovo]] by the [[Kosovo Assembly]]. After being sworn in, he declared his support for Kosovo independence, whilst promising to protect the rights of the Serbian minority.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4794258.stm \"New Kosovo PM wants independence\"], ''BBC News'', March 10, 2006.

Shortly afterwards, he joined the [[Yugoslav People's Army]] (JNA) as an artillery captain. In 1991 the [[Yugoslav wars]] broke out and he deserted from the JNA and joined the [[Croatian National Guard]] (which transformed into the Croatian Army), when the Republic of Croatia [[Croatian War of Independence|fought a war]] in [[Breakup of Yugoslavia|breaking away]] from Yugoslavia. The Croatian Army fought the Serb breakaway [[Republic of Serbian Krajina]]. He participated in several military operations, he first was in [[Operation Maslenica]] when he was the head of [[Velebit]]'s artillery section, from January to February 1993, [[Operation Medak pocket]] near Gospi\u0107, in which he was wounded, and [[Operation Storm]] in August 1995 that captured most of the Krajina territory. Subsequently, he continued the advance as head of Croatian forces into the Republic of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] fighting in western Bosnia against the forces of the [[Republika Srpska|Serb Republic]] in [[Operation Maestral]].\n\nAfter the war the Croatian Army was reformed and President [[Franjo Tu\u0111man]] named \u00c7eku commanding officer of the Fifth District Region in [[Rijeka]]. In 1998 he filed a request for retirement in order to go to Kosovo to join the ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) that fought Serbian rule, which was officially fulfilled in February 1999 with his resignation.\n\n==Kosovo War==\n\u00c7eku had developed contacts with the KLA in the mid-1990s. When war broke out in Kosovo, the KLA initially did very badly against the Yugoslav forces, due in part to poor leadership under senior commander [[Sylejman Selimi]], a militarily inexperienced individual who had been given the post largely because of his influence in the [[Drenica]] region (the KLA's heartland).\n\nIn May 1999, \u00c7eku was appointed the KLA's chief of staff, replacing Selimi. He immediately set about reorganising the KLA and implementing a proper military structure within the organization. In the closing days of the Kosovo War, the KLA began providing systematic intelligence to [[NATO]] as well as mounting attacks to lure Serbian forces into the open, enabling NATO warplanes to bomb them. According to reports at the time, \u00c7eku was the principal liaison between NATO and the KLA.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}\n\n==Kosovo Protection Corps==\nFollowing the end of the war in June 1999, \u00c7eku oversaw the demilitarisation of the KLA and its transformation into the [[Kosovo Protection Corps]] (KPC), an ostensibly civilian organization charged with disaster response, demining, search and response and humanitarian projects.  Although the international community insisted the KPC was a civilian organization, \u00c7eku and its membership said they believed the KPC should evolve into the future army of an independent Kosovo.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} \u00c7eku managed ably many difficult challenges for the KPC, including allegations that its members were supporting the [[2001 insurgency in the Republic of Macedonia|ethnic Albanian insurgency in Macedonia in 2001]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}\n\n==Political career==\nOn 10 March 2006, \u00c7eku was elected [[Prime Minister of Kosovo]] by the [[Kosovo Assembly]].

The wax, which adheres to the hair as it hardens, is then covered with small strips of cloth. When the wax hardens sufficiently, the cloth is pulled off quickly, removing the hair from its roots as the wax is pulled away.

It is a form of [[luminescence]]. In most cases, the emitted light has a longer [[wavelength]], and therefore lower energy, than the absorbed radiation. The most striking example of fluorescence occurs when the absorbed radiation is in the [[ultraviolet]] region of the [[Spectrum#Electromagnetic spectrum|spectrum]], and thus invisible to the human eye, while the emitted light is in the visible region, which gives the fluorescent substance a distinct color that can be seen only when exposed to [[UV light]]. Fluorescent materials cease to glow nearly immediately when the radiation source stops, unlike [[phosphorescence|phosphorescent]] materials, which continue to emit light for some time after.\n\nFluorescence has many practical applications, including [[mineralogy]], [[gemology]], [[medicine]], chemical sensors ([[fluorescence spectroscopy]]), [[fluorescent labelling]], [[dye]]s, biological detectors, and cosmic-ray detection. Its most common everyday application is in energy-saving [[fluorescent lamp]]s and [[LED lamps]], where fluorescent coatings are used to convert short-wavelength UV light or blue light into longer-wavelength yellow light, thereby mimicking the [[Color temperature|warm light]] of energy-inefficient [[incandescent lamp]]s. Fluorescence also occurs frequently in nature in some minerals and in various biological forms in many branches of the animal kingdom.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Lignum nephriticum - cup of Philippine lignum nephriticum, Pterocarpus indicus, and flask containing its fluorescent solution Hi.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''[[Lignum nephriticum]]'' cup made from the wood of the narra tree (''[[Pterocarpus indicus]]''), and a flask containing its fluorescent [[Solution (chemistry)|solution]]]]\n[[File:Matlaline structure.svg|thumb|right|Matlaline, the fluorescent substance in the wood of the tree ''Eysenhardtia polystachya'']]\nAn early observation of fluorescence was described in 1560 by [[Bernardino de Sahag\u00fan]] and in 1565 by [[Nicol\u00e1s Monardes]] in the [[infusion]] known as ''[[lignum nephriticum]]'' ([[Latin]] for \"kidney wood\").

The specific frequencies of exciting and emitted lights are dependent on the particular system.\n\nS<sub>0</sub> is called the ground state of the [[fluorophore]] (fluorescent molecule), and S<sub>1</sub> is its first (electronically) excited singlet state.\n\nA molecule in S<sub>1</sub> can relax by various competing pathways. It can undergo ''non-radiative'' [[Photoluminescence#Relaxation|relaxation]] in which the excitation energy is dissipated as [[heat]] (vibrations) to the solvent. Excited organic molecules can also relax via conversion to a [[triplet state]], which may subsequently relax via [[phosphorescence]], or by a secondary non-radiative relaxation step.\n\nRelaxation from S<sub>1</sub> can also occur through interaction with a second molecule through [[Quenching (fluorescence)|fluorescence quenching]]. Molecular [[oxygen]] (O<sub>2</sub>) is an extremely efficient quencher of fluorescence just because of its unusual triplet ground state.\n\nIn most cases, the emitted light has a longer wavelength, and therefore lower energy, than the absorbed radiation; this phenomenon is known as the [[Stokes shift]]. However, when the absorbed electromagnetic radiation is intense, it is possible for one [[electron]] to absorb two [[photon]]s; this [[two-photon absorption]] can lead to emission of radiation having a shorter wavelength than the absorbed radiation. The emitted radiation may also be of the same wavelength as the absorbed radiation, termed \"resonance fluorescence\".<ref>Holler, F. James; Skoog, Douglas A. and Crouch, Stanley R. (2006) ''Principles Of Instrumental Analysis''. Cengage Learning. {{ISBN|0495012017}}</ref>\n\nMolecules that are excited through light absorption or via a different process (e.g. as the product of a reaction) can transfer energy to a second 'sensitized' molecule, which is converted to its excited state and can then fluoresce.\n\n===Quantum yield===\nThe fluorescence [[quantum yield]] gives the efficiency of the fluorescence process. It is defined as the ratio of the number of photons emitted to the number of photons absorbed.<ref>[[#Lakowicz|Lakowicz]], p. 10</ref><ref>Valeur, Bernard, Berberan-Santos, Mario (2012). ''Molecular Fluorescence: Principles and Applications''. Wiley-VCH. {{ISBN|978-3-527-32837-6}}. p. 64</ref>\n\n: <math> \\Phi = \\frac {\\text{Number of photons emitted}} {\\text{Number of photons absorbed}} </math>\n\nThe maximum possible fluorescence quantum yield is 1.0 (100%); each [[photon]] absorbed results in a photon emitted. Compounds with quantum yields of 0.10 are still considered quite fluorescent. Another way to define the quantum yield of fluorescence is by the rate of excited state decay:\n\n: <math> \\Phi = \\frac{ { k}_{ f} }{ \\sum_{i}{ k}_{i } } </math>\n\nwhere <math>{ k}_{ f}</math> is the rate constant of [[spontaneous emission]] of radiation and\n\n:<math> \\sum_{i}{ k}_{i } </math>\n\nis the sum of all rates of excited state decay. Other rates of excited state decay are caused by mechanisms other than photon emission and are, therefore, often called \"non-radiative rates\", which can include:\ndynamic collisional quenching, near-field dipole-dipole interaction (or [[resonance energy transfer]]), internal conversion, and [[intersystem crossing]]. Thus, if the rate of any pathway changes, both the excited state lifetime and the fluorescence quantum yield will be affected.\n\nFluorescence quantum yields are measured by comparison to a standard. The [[quinine]] salt ''quinine sulfate'' in a [[sulfuric acid]] solution is a common fluorescence standard.\n\n===Lifetime===\n[[File:Jablonski Diagram of Fluorescence Only.png|thumb|[[Jablonski diagram]]. After an electron absorbs a high-energy photon the system is excited electronically and vibrationally. The system relaxes vibrationally, and eventually fluoresces at a longer wavelength.]]\n\nThe fluorescence lifetime refers to the average time the molecule stays in its excited state before emitting a photon. Fluorescence typically follows [[first-order kinetics]]:\n\n:<math> \\left[S_1 \\right] = \\left[S_1 \\right]_0 e^{-\\Gamma t} </math>\n\nwhere <math>\\left[S_1 \\right]</math> is the concentration of excited state molecules at time <math>t</math>, <math>\\left[S_1 \\right]_0</math> is the initial concentration and [[Gamma|<math>\\Gamma</math>]] is the decay rate or the inverse of the fluorescence lifetime. This is an instance of [[exponential decay]]. Various radiative and non-radiative processes can de-populate the excited state. In such case the total decay rate is the sum over all rates:\n\n:<math> \\Gamma_{tot}=\\Gamma_{rad} + \\Gamma_{nrad} </math>\n\nwhere <math>\\Gamma_{tot}</math> is the total decay rate, <math>\\Gamma_{rad}</math> the radiative decay rate and <math>\\Gamma_{nrad}</math> the non-radiative decay rate. It is similar to a first-order chemical reaction in which the first-order rate constant is the sum of all of the rates (a parallel kinetic model). If the rate of spontaneous emission, or any of the other rates are fast, the lifetime is short. For commonly used fluorescent compounds, typical excited state decay times for photon emissions with energies from the [[Ultraviolet|UV]] to [[near infrared]] are within the range of 0.5 to 20 [[nanoseconds]]. The fluorescence lifetime is an important parameter for practical applications of fluorescence such as [[fluorescence resonance energy transfer]] and [[fluorescence-lifetime imaging microscopy]].\n\n===Jablonski diagram===\nThe [[Jablonski diagram]] describes most of the relaxation mechanisms for excited state molecules. The diagram alongside shows how fluorescence occurs due to the relaxation of certain excited electrons of a molecule.<ref name=\"mehta\">[http://pharmaxchange.info/press/2013/03/animation-for-the-principle-of-fluorescence-and-uv-visible-absorbance/ \"Animation for the Principle of Fluorescence and UV-Visible Absorbance\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130609034835/http://pharmaxchange.info/press/2013/03/animation-for-the-principle-of-fluorescence-and-uv-visible-absorbance/ |date=9 June 2013 }}.

The transition moment is dependent on the physical orientation of the fluorophore molecule. For fluorophores in solution this means that the intensity and polarization of the emitted light is dependent on rotational diffusion. Therefore, anisotropy measurements can be used to investigate how freely a fluorescent molecule moves in a particular environment.\n\nFluorescence anisotropy can be defined quantitatively as\n:<math>r = {I_\\parallel - I_\\perp \\over I_\\parallel + 2I_\\perp}</math>\nwhere <math>I_\\parallel</math> is the emitted intensity parallel to polarization of the excitation light and <math>I_\\perp</math> is the emitted intensity perpendicular to the polarization of the excitation light.<ref>Valeur, Bernard, Berberan-Santos, Mario (2012).

This phenomenon was termed \"Farbenglut\" by [[Hermann von Helmholtz]] and \"fluorence\" by Ralph M. Evans. It is generally thought to be related to the high brightness of the color relative to what it would be as a component of white. Fluorescence shifts energy in the incident illumination from shorter wavelengths to longer (such as blue to yellow) and thus can make the fluorescent color appear brighter (more saturated) than it could possibly be by reflection alone.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Schieber|first1=Frank|title=Modeling the Appearance of Fluorescent Colors|journal=Proceedings of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society Annual Meeting|date=October 2001|volume=45|issue=18|pages=1324\u20131327|doi=10.1177/154193120104501802|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/8f47b05cbee68135fead67f33c487ca9b43bd280}}</ref>\n\n==Rules==\nThere are several general [[rule of thumb|rules]] that deal with fluorescence. Each of the following rules has exceptions but they are useful guidelines for understanding fluorescence (these rules do not necessarily apply to [[two-photon absorption]]).\n\n===Kasha's rule===\n[[Kasha's rule]] dictates that the quantum yield of luminescence is independent of the wavelength of exciting radiation.<ref>[[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry|IUPAC]]. [http://goldbook.iupac.org/K03371.html Kasha\u2013Vavilov rule \u2013 Compendium of Chemical Terminology, 2nd ed.

Blackwell Scientific Publications, Oxford, 1997.</ref> This occurs because excited molecules usually decay to the lowest vibrational level of the excited state before fluorescence emission takes place. The Kasha\u2013Vavilov rule does not always apply and is violated severely in many simple molecules. A somewhat more reliable statement, although still with exceptions, would be that the fluorescence spectrum shows very little dependence on the wavelength of exciting radiation.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hai |first1=Q |title=Suppression of Kasha's rule as a mechanism for fluorescent molecular rotors and aggregation-induced emission |journal=Nature Chemistry |date=2017 |volume=9 |issue=1}}</ref>\n\n===Mirror image rule===\nFor many fluorophores the absorption spectrum is a mirror image of the emission spectrum.<ref>[[#Lakowicz|Lakowicz]], pp. 6\u20138</ref> This is known as the mirror image rule and is related to the [[Franck\u2013Condon principle]] which states that electronic transitions are vertical, that is energy changes without distance changing as can be represented with a vertical line in Jablonski diagram. This means the nucleus does not move and the vibration levels of the excited state resemble the vibration levels of the ground state.\n\n===Stokes shift===\n{{main|Stokes shift}}\nIn general, emitted fluorescence light has a longer wavelength and lower energy than the absorbed light.<ref>[[#Lakowicz|Lakowicz]], pp. 6\u20137</ref> This phenomenon, known as [[Stokes shift]], is due to energy loss between the time a photon is absorbed and when a new one is emitted. The causes and magnitude of Stokes shift can be complex and are dependent on the fluorophore and its environment. However, there are some common causes. It is frequently due to non-radiative decay to the lowest vibrational energy level of the excited state. Another factor is that the emission of fluorescence frequently leaves a fluorophore in a higher vibrational level of the ground state.\n\n==In nature==\n{{main|Fluorescence in the life sciences}}\nThere are many natural compounds that exhibit fluorescence, and they have a number of applications. Some deep-sea animals, such as the [[greeneye]], have fluorescent structures.\n\n=== vs. bioluminescence and biophosphorescence===\n====Fluorescence====\nFluorescence is the temporary absorption of [[electromagnetic radiation|electromagnetic]] wavelengths from the [[visible light]] spectrum by fluorescent molecules, and the subsequent emission of light at a lower energy level. When it occurs in a living organism, it is sometimes called biofluorescence. This causes the light that is emitted to be a different color than the light that is absorbed. Stimulating light excites an [[electron]], raising energy to an unstable level. This instability is unfavorable, so the energized electron is returned to a stable state almost as immediately as it becomes unstable. This return to stability corresponds with the release of excess energy in the form of fluorescence light. This emission of light is only observable when the stimulant light is still providing light to the organism/object and is typically yellow, pink, orange, red, green, or purple. Fluorescence is often confused with the following forms of biotic light, bioluminescence and biophosphorescence.<ref name=\"Fluorescence in marine organisms\">{{cite web|title=Fluorescence in marine organisms|url=http://gestaltswitchexpeditions.com/fluorescence-in-marine-orga/|website=Gestalt Switch Expeditions|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150221070425/http://www.gestaltswitchexpeditions.com/fluorescence-in-marine-orga/|archivedate=21 February 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Pumpkin toadlets that live in the Brazilian Atlantic forest are fluorescent.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.business-standard.com/article/pti-stories/fluorescence-discovered-in-tiny-brazilian-frogs-119032900584_1.html|title=Fluorescence discovered in tiny Brazilian frogs|last=India|first=Press Trust of|date=2019-03-29|work=Business Standard India|access-date=2019-03-30}}</ref>\n\n=====New Form of Biofluorescence=====\n\nIn a study published in the journal, iScience, a new form of biofluorescence described in two species of sharks, wherein it was due to undescribed group of brominated tryptophan-kynurenine small molecule metabolites.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Park|first=Hyun Bong|last2=Lam|first2=Yick Chong|last3=Gaffney|first3=Jean P.|last4=Weaver|first4=James C.|last5=Krivoshik|first5=Sara Rose|last6=Hamchand|first6=Randy|last7=Pieribone|first7=Vincent|last8=Gruber|first8=David F.|last9=Crawford|first9=Jason M.|date=2019-09-27|title=Bright Green Biofluorescence in Sharks Derives from Bromo-Kynurenine Metabolism|url=https://www.cell.com/iscience/abstract/S2589-0042(19)30244-5|journal=iScience|language=English|volume=19|pages=1291\u20131336|doi=10.1016/j.isci.2019.07.019|issn=2589-0042|pmid=31402257|pmc=6831821}}</ref>\n\n====Bioluminescence====\n[[Bioluminescence]] differs from fluorescence in that it is the natural production of light by chemical reactions within an organism, whereas fluorescence is the absorption and reemission of light from the environment.<ref name=\"Fluorescence in marine organisms\"/> A firefly and anglerfish are two example of bioluminescent organisms.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://earthnworld.com/top-10-amazing-bioluminescent-animals-planet-earth/|title=Top 10 Amazing Bioluminescent Animals on Planet Earth|last=Utsav|date=2017-12-02|website=Earth and World|language=en-US|access-date=2019-03-30}}</ref>\n\n====Phosphorescence====\n[[Phosphorescence|Biophosphorescence]] is similar to fluorescence in its requirement of light wavelengths as a provider of excitation energy.

Therefore, warm colors from the visual light spectrum appear less vibrant at increasing depths. Water scatters light of shorter wavelengths above violet, meaning cooler colors dominate the visual field in the [[photic zone]]. Light intensity decreases 10 fold with every 75 m of depth, so at depths of 75 m, light is 10% as intense as it is on the surface, and is only 1% as intense at 150 m as it is on the surface. Because the water filters out the wavelengths and intensity of water reaching certain depths, different proteins, because of the wavelengths and intensities of light they are capable of absorbing, are better suited to different depths. Theoretically, some fish eyes can detect light as deep as 1000 m. At these depths of the aphotic zone, the only sources of light are organisms themselves, giving off light through chemical reactions in a process called bioluminescence.\n\nFluorescence is simply defined as the absorption of electromagnetic radiation at one [[wavelength]] and its reemission at another, lower energy wavelength.<ref name=\"sparks\" /> Thus any type of fluorescence depends on the presence of external sources of light. Biologically functional fluorescence is found in the photic zone, where there is not only enough light to cause fluorescence, but enough light for other organisms to detect it. <ref name=\"Mazel2017\">{{cite journal|last1=Mazel|first1=Charles|title=Method for Determining the Contribution of Fluorescence to an Optical Signature, with Implications for Postulating a Visual Function|journal=Frontiers in Marine Science|volume=4|year=2017|issn=2296-7745|doi=10.3389/fmars.2017.00266}}</ref>\nThe visual field in the photic zone is naturally blue, so colors of fluorescence can be detected as bright reds, oranges, yellows, and greens. Green is the most commonly found color in the marine spectrum, yellow the second most, orange the third, and red is the rarest. Fluorescence can occur in organisms in the aphotic zone as a byproduct of that same organism's bioluminescence. Some fluorescence in the aphotic zone is merely a byproduct of the organism's tissue biochemistry and does not have a functional purpose.

[[Ruby|Rubies]], [[emerald]]s, and [[diamonds]] exhibit red fluorescence under long-wave UV, blue and sometimes green light; diamonds also emit light under [[X-ray]] radiation.\n\nFluorescence in minerals is caused by a wide range of activators. In some cases, the concentration of the activator must be restricted to below a certain level, to prevent quenching of the fluorescent emission. Furthermore, the mineral must be free of impurities such as iron or copper, to prevent quenching of possible fluorescence. Divalent [[manganese]], in concentrations of up to several percent, is responsible for the red or orange fluorescence of [[calcite]], the green fluorescence of [[willemite]], the yellow fluorescence of [[esperite]], and the orange fluorescence of [[wollastonite]] and [[clinohedrite]]. Hexavalent [[uranium]], in the form of the [[uranyl cation]], fluoresces at all concentrations in a yellow green, and is the cause of fluorescence of minerals such as [[autunite]] or [[andersonite]], and, at low concentration, is the cause of the fluorescence of such materials as some samples of [[hyalite]] opal. Trivalent [[chromium]] at low concentration is the source of the red fluorescence of [[ruby]]. Divalent [[europium]] is the source of the blue fluorescence, when seen in the mineral [[fluorite]]. Trivalent [[lanthanide]]s such as [[terbium]] and [[dysprosium]] are the principal activators of the creamy yellow fluorescence exhibited by the [[yttrofluorite]] variety of the mineral fluorite, and contribute to the orange fluorescence of [[zircon]]. [[Powellite]] ([[calcium molybdate]]) and [[scheelite]] (calcium tungstate) fluoresce intrinsically in yellow and blue, respectively. When present together in solid solution, energy is transferred from the higher-energy [[tungsten]] to the lower-energy [[molybdenum]], such that fairly low levels of [[molybdenum]] are sufficient to cause a yellow emission for [[scheelite]], instead of blue. Low-iron [[sphalerite]] (zinc sulfide), fluoresces and phosphoresces in a range of colors, influenced by the presence of various trace impurities.\n\nCrude oil ([[petroleum]]) fluoresces in a range of colors, from dull-brown for heavy oils and tars through to bright-yellowish and bluish-white for very light oils and condensates. This phenomenon is used in [[oil exploration]] drilling to identify very small amounts of oil in drill cuttings and core samples.\n\n====Organic liquids====\nOrganic solutions such [[anthracene]] or [[stilbene]], dissolved in [[benzene]] or [[toluene]], fluoresce with [[ultraviolet]] or [[gamma ray]] [[irradiation]]. The decay times of this fluorescence are on the order of nanoseconds, since the duration of the light depends on the lifetime of the excited states of the fluorescent material, in this case anthracene or stilbene.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1088/0370-1328/79/3/306|title = The Fluorescence and Scintillation Decay Times of Crystalline Anthracene|journal = Proceedings of the Physical Society|volume = 79|issue = 3|pages = 494\u2013496|year = 1962|last1 = Birks|first1 = J.

An electric discharge in the tube causes the mercury atoms to emit mostly ultraviolet light. The tube is lined with a coating of a fluorescent material, called the ''[[phosphor]]'', which absorbs ultraviolet light and re-emits visible light. Fluorescent [[lighting]] is more energy-efficient than [[incandescent]] lighting elements. However, the uneven [[spectrum]] of traditional fluorescent lamps may cause certain colors to appear different than when illuminated by incandescent light or [[daylight]]. The mercury vapor emission spectrum is dominated by a short-wave UV line at 254&nbsp;nm (which provides most of the energy to the phosphors), accompanied by visible light emission at 436&nbsp;nm (blue), 546&nbsp;nm (green) and 579&nbsp;nm (yellow-orange). These three lines can be observed superimposed on the white continuum using a hand spectroscope, for light emitted by the usual white fluorescent tubes. These same visible lines, accompanied by the emission lines of trivalent europium and trivalent terbium, and further accompanied by the emission continuum of divalent europium in the blue region, comprise the more discontinuous light emission of the modern trichromatic phosphor systems used in many [[compact fluorescent lamp]] and traditional lamps where better color rendition is a goal.<ref name=\"How Fluorescent Lamps Work\">{{cite web|last=Harris|first=Tom|title=How Fluorescent Lamps Work|url=http://home.howstuffworks.com/fluorescent-lamp.htm|work=HowStuffWorks|publisher=Discovery Communications|accessdate=27 June 2010|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100706040948/http://home.howstuffworks.com/fluorescent-lamp.htm|archivedate=6 July 2010|df=dmy-all|date=2001-12-07}}</ref>\n\nFluorescent lights were first available to the public at the [[1939 New York World's Fair]].

Also, [[Thin layer chromatography|TLC]] plates can be visualized if the compounds or a coloring reagent is fluorescent. Fluorescence is most effective when there is a larger ratio of atoms at lower energy levels in a [[Boltzmann distribution]]. There is, then, a higher probability of excitement and release of photons by lower-energy atoms, making analysis more efficient.\n\n===Spectroscopy===\n{{Main|Fluorescence spectroscopy}}\nUsually the setup of a fluorescence assay involves a light source, which may emit many different wavelengths of light. In general, a single wavelength is required for proper analysis, so, in order to selectively filter the light, it is passed through an excitation monochromator, and then that chosen wavelength is passed through the sample cell. After absorption and re-emission of the energy, many wavelengths may emerge due to [[Stokes shift]] and various [[electron transition]]s. To separate and analyze them, the fluorescent radiation is passed through an emission [[monochromator]], and observed selectively by a detector.<ref>{{cite book|author=Harris, Daniel C.|title=Exploring chemical analysis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x5eEW76lizEC|date=2004|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=978-0-7167-0571-0|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160731220213/https://books.google.com/books?id=x5eEW76lizEC|archivedate=31 July 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Biochemistry and medicine===\n{{Main|Fluorescence in the life sciences}}\n[[Image:FluorescentCells.jpg|thumb|right|[[Endothelium|Endothelial cells]] under the microscope with three separate channels marking specific cellular components]]\nFluorescence in the life sciences is used generally as a non-destructive way of tracking or analysis of biological molecules by means of the fluorescent emission at a specific frequency where there is no background from the excitation light, as relatively few cellular components are naturally fluorescent (called intrinsic or [[autofluorescence]]).\nIn fact, a [[protein]] or other component can be \"labelled\" with an extrinsic [[fluorophore]], a fluorescent [[dye]] that can be a small molecule, protein, or quantum dot, finding a large use in many biological applications.<ref>[[#Lakowicz|Lakowicz]], p. xxvi</ref>\n\nThe quantification of a dye is done with a [[spectrofluorometer]] and finds additional applications in:\n\n====Microscopy====\n* When scanning the fluorescence intensity across a plane one has [[fluorescence microscope|fluorescence microscopy]] of tissues, cells, or subcellular structures, which is accomplished by labeling an antibody with a fluorophore and allowing the antibody to find its target antigen within the sample.

It is a form of [[luminescence]]. In most cases, the emitted light has a longer [[wavelength]], and therefore lower energy, than the absorbed radiation. The most striking example of fluorescence occurs when the absorbed radiation is in the [[ultraviolet]] region of the [[Spectrum#Electromagnetic spectrum|spectrum]], and thus invisible to the human eye, while the emitted light is in the visible region, which gives the fluorescent substance a distinct color that can be seen only when exposed to [[UV light]]. Fluorescent materials cease to glow nearly immediately when the radiation source stops, unlike [[phosphorescence|phosphorescent]] materials, which continue to emit light for some time after.\n\nFluorescence has many practical applications, including [[mineralogy]], [[gemology]], [[medicine]], chemical sensors ([[fluorescence spectroscopy]]), [[fluorescent labelling]], [[dye]]s, biological detectors, and cosmic-ray detection. Its most common everyday application is in energy-saving [[fluorescent lamp]]s and [[LED lamps]], where fluorescent coatings are used to convert short-wavelength UV light or blue light into longer-wavelength yellow light, thereby mimicking the [[Color temperature|warm light]] of energy-inefficient [[incandescent lamp]]s. Fluorescence also occurs frequently in nature in some minerals and in various biological forms in many branches of the animal kingdom.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Lignum nephriticum - cup of Philippine lignum nephriticum, Pterocarpus indicus, and flask containing its fluorescent solution Hi.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''[[Lignum nephriticum]]'' cup made from the wood of the narra tree (''[[Pterocarpus indicus]]''), and a flask containing its fluorescent [[Solution (chemistry)|solution]]]]\n[[File:Matlaline structure.svg|thumb|right|Matlaline, the fluorescent substance in the wood of the tree ''Eysenhardtia polystachya'']]\nAn early observation of fluorescence was described in 1560 by [[Bernardino de Sahag\u00fan]] and in 1565 by [[Nicol\u00e1s Monardes]] in the [[infusion]] known as ''[[lignum nephriticum]]'' ([[Latin]] for \"kidney wood\").

The specific frequencies of exciting and emitted lights are dependent on the particular system.\n\nS<sub>0</sub> is called the ground state of the [[fluorophore]] (fluorescent molecule), and S<sub>1</sub> is its first (electronically) excited singlet state.\n\nA molecule in S<sub>1</sub> can relax by various competing pathways. It can undergo ''non-radiative'' [[Photoluminescence#Relaxation|relaxation]] in which the excitation energy is dissipated as [[heat]] (vibrations) to the solvent. Excited organic molecules can also relax via conversion to a [[triplet state]], which may subsequently relax via [[phosphorescence]], or by a secondary non-radiative relaxation step.\n\nRelaxation from S<sub>1</sub> can also occur through interaction with a second molecule through [[Quenching (fluorescence)|fluorescence quenching]]. Molecular [[oxygen]] (O<sub>2</sub>) is an extremely efficient quencher of fluorescence just because of its unusual triplet ground state.\n\nIn most cases, the emitted light has a longer wavelength, and therefore lower energy, than the absorbed radiation; this phenomenon is known as the [[Stokes shift]]. However, when the absorbed electromagnetic radiation is intense, it is possible for one [[electron]] to absorb two [[photon]]s; this [[two-photon absorption]] can lead to emission of radiation having a shorter wavelength than the absorbed radiation. The emitted radiation may also be of the same wavelength as the absorbed radiation, termed \"resonance fluorescence\".<ref>Holler, F. James; Skoog, Douglas A. and Crouch, Stanley R. (2006) ''Principles Of Instrumental Analysis''. Cengage Learning. {{ISBN|0495012017}}</ref>\n\nMolecules that are excited through light absorption or via a different process (e.g. as the product of a reaction) can transfer energy to a second 'sensitized' molecule, which is converted to its excited state and can then fluoresce.\n\n===Quantum yield===\nThe fluorescence [[quantum yield]] gives the efficiency of the fluorescence process. It is defined as the ratio of the number of photons emitted to the number of photons absorbed.<ref>[[#Lakowicz|Lakowicz]], p. 10</ref><ref>Valeur, Bernard, Berberan-Santos, Mario (2012). ''Molecular Fluorescence: Principles and Applications''. Wiley-VCH. {{ISBN|978-3-527-32837-6}}. p. 64</ref>\n\n: <math> \\Phi = \\frac {\\text{Number of photons emitted}} {\\text{Number of photons absorbed}} </math>\n\nThe maximum possible fluorescence quantum yield is 1.0 (100%); each [[photon]] absorbed results in a photon emitted. Compounds with quantum yields of 0.10 are still considered quite fluorescent. Another way to define the quantum yield of fluorescence is by the rate of excited state decay:\n\n: <math> \\Phi = \\frac{ { k}_{ f} }{ \\sum_{i}{ k}_{i } } </math>\n\nwhere <math>{ k}_{ f}</math> is the rate constant of [[spontaneous emission]] of radiation and\n\n:<math> \\sum_{i}{ k}_{i } </math>\n\nis the sum of all rates of excited state decay. Other rates of excited state decay are caused by mechanisms other than photon emission and are, therefore, often called \"non-radiative rates\", which can include:\ndynamic collisional quenching, near-field dipole-dipole interaction (or [[resonance energy transfer]]), internal conversion, and [[intersystem crossing]]. Thus, if the rate of any pathway changes, both the excited state lifetime and the fluorescence quantum yield will be affected.\n\nFluorescence quantum yields are measured by comparison to a standard. The [[quinine]] salt ''quinine sulfate'' in a [[sulfuric acid]] solution is a common fluorescence standard.\n\n===Lifetime===\n[[File:Jablonski Diagram of Fluorescence Only.png|thumb|[[Jablonski diagram]]. After an electron absorbs a high-energy photon the system is excited electronically and vibrationally. The system relaxes vibrationally, and eventually fluoresces at a longer wavelength.]]\n\nThe fluorescence lifetime refers to the average time the molecule stays in its excited state before emitting a photon. Fluorescence typically follows [[first-order kinetics]]:\n\n:<math> \\left[S_1 \\right] = \\left[S_1 \\right]_0 e^{-\\Gamma t} </math>\n\nwhere <math>\\left[S_1 \\right]</math> is the concentration of excited state molecules at time <math>t</math>, <math>\\left[S_1 \\right]_0</math> is the initial concentration and [[Gamma|<math>\\Gamma</math>]] is the decay rate or the inverse of the fluorescence lifetime. This is an instance of [[exponential decay]]. Various radiative and non-radiative processes can de-populate the excited state. In such case the total decay rate is the sum over all rates:\n\n:<math> \\Gamma_{tot}=\\Gamma_{rad} + \\Gamma_{nrad} </math>\n\nwhere <math>\\Gamma_{tot}</math> is the total decay rate, <math>\\Gamma_{rad}</math> the radiative decay rate and <math>\\Gamma_{nrad}</math> the non-radiative decay rate. It is similar to a first-order chemical reaction in which the first-order rate constant is the sum of all of the rates (a parallel kinetic model). If the rate of spontaneous emission, or any of the other rates are fast, the lifetime is short. For commonly used fluorescent compounds, typical excited state decay times for photon emissions with energies from the [[Ultraviolet|UV]] to [[near infrared]] are within the range of 0.5 to 20 [[nanoseconds]]. The fluorescence lifetime is an important parameter for practical applications of fluorescence such as [[fluorescence resonance energy transfer]] and [[fluorescence-lifetime imaging microscopy]].\n\n===Jablonski diagram===\nThe [[Jablonski diagram]] describes most of the relaxation mechanisms for excited state molecules. The diagram alongside shows how fluorescence occurs due to the relaxation of certain excited electrons of a molecule.<ref name=\"mehta\">[http://pharmaxchange.info/press/2013/03/animation-for-the-principle-of-fluorescence-and-uv-visible-absorbance/ \"Animation for the Principle of Fluorescence and UV-Visible Absorbance\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130609034835/http://pharmaxchange.info/press/2013/03/animation-for-the-principle-of-fluorescence-and-uv-visible-absorbance/ |date=9 June 2013 }}.

The transition moment is dependent on the physical orientation of the fluorophore molecule. For fluorophores in solution this means that the intensity and polarization of the emitted light is dependent on rotational diffusion. Therefore, anisotropy measurements can be used to investigate how freely a fluorescent molecule moves in a particular environment.\n\nFluorescence anisotropy can be defined quantitatively as\n:<math>r = {I_\\parallel - I_\\perp \\over I_\\parallel + 2I_\\perp}</math>\nwhere <math>I_\\parallel</math> is the emitted intensity parallel to polarization of the excitation light and <math>I_\\perp</math> is the emitted intensity perpendicular to the polarization of the excitation light.<ref>Valeur, Bernard, Berberan-Santos, Mario (2012).

This phenomenon was termed \"Farbenglut\" by [[Hermann von Helmholtz]] and \"fluorence\" by Ralph M. Evans. It is generally thought to be related to the high brightness of the color relative to what it would be as a component of white. Fluorescence shifts energy in the incident illumination from shorter wavelengths to longer (such as blue to yellow) and thus can make the fluorescent color appear brighter (more saturated) than it could possibly be by reflection alone.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Schieber|first1=Frank|title=Modeling the Appearance of Fluorescent Colors|journal=Proceedings of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society Annual Meeting|date=October 2001|volume=45|issue=18|pages=1324\u20131327|doi=10.1177/154193120104501802|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/8f47b05cbee68135fead67f33c487ca9b43bd280}}</ref>\n\n==Rules==\nThere are several general [[rule of thumb|rules]] that deal with fluorescence. Each of the following rules has exceptions but they are useful guidelines for understanding fluorescence (these rules do not necessarily apply to [[two-photon absorption]]).\n\n===Kasha's rule===\n[[Kasha's rule]] dictates that the quantum yield of luminescence is independent of the wavelength of exciting radiation.<ref>[[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry|IUPAC]]. [http://goldbook.iupac.org/K03371.html Kasha\u2013Vavilov rule \u2013 Compendium of Chemical Terminology, 2nd ed.

Blackwell Scientific Publications, Oxford, 1997.</ref> This occurs because excited molecules usually decay to the lowest vibrational level of the excited state before fluorescence emission takes place. The Kasha\u2013Vavilov rule does not always apply and is violated severely in many simple molecules. A somewhat more reliable statement, although still with exceptions, would be that the fluorescence spectrum shows very little dependence on the wavelength of exciting radiation.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hai |first1=Q |title=Suppression of Kasha's rule as a mechanism for fluorescent molecular rotors and aggregation-induced emission |journal=Nature Chemistry |date=2017 |volume=9 |issue=1}}</ref>\n\n===Mirror image rule===\nFor many fluorophores the absorption spectrum is a mirror image of the emission spectrum.<ref>[[#Lakowicz|Lakowicz]], pp. 6\u20138</ref> This is known as the mirror image rule and is related to the [[Franck\u2013Condon principle]] which states that electronic transitions are vertical, that is energy changes without distance changing as can be represented with a vertical line in Jablonski diagram. This means the nucleus does not move and the vibration levels of the excited state resemble the vibration levels of the ground state.\n\n===Stokes shift===\n{{main|Stokes shift}}\nIn general, emitted fluorescence light has a longer wavelength and lower energy than the absorbed light.<ref>[[#Lakowicz|Lakowicz]], pp. 6\u20137</ref> This phenomenon, known as [[Stokes shift]], is due to energy loss between the time a photon is absorbed and when a new one is emitted. The causes and magnitude of Stokes shift can be complex and are dependent on the fluorophore and its environment. However, there are some common causes. It is frequently due to non-radiative decay to the lowest vibrational energy level of the excited state. Another factor is that the emission of fluorescence frequently leaves a fluorophore in a higher vibrational level of the ground state.\n\n==In nature==\n{{main|Fluorescence in the life sciences}}\nThere are many natural compounds that exhibit fluorescence, and they have a number of applications. Some deep-sea animals, such as the [[greeneye]], have fluorescent structures.\n\n=== vs. bioluminescence and biophosphorescence===\n====Fluorescence====\nFluorescence is the temporary absorption of [[electromagnetic radiation|electromagnetic]] wavelengths from the [[visible light]] spectrum by fluorescent molecules, and the subsequent emission of light at a lower energy level. When it occurs in a living organism, it is sometimes called biofluorescence. This causes the light that is emitted to be a different color than the light that is absorbed. Stimulating light excites an [[electron]], raising energy to an unstable level. This instability is unfavorable, so the energized electron is returned to a stable state almost as immediately as it becomes unstable. This return to stability corresponds with the release of excess energy in the form of fluorescence light. This emission of light is only observable when the stimulant light is still providing light to the organism/object and is typically yellow, pink, orange, red, green, or purple. Fluorescence is often confused with the following forms of biotic light, bioluminescence and biophosphorescence.<ref name=\"Fluorescence in marine organisms\">{{cite web|title=Fluorescence in marine organisms|url=http://gestaltswitchexpeditions.com/fluorescence-in-marine-orga/|website=Gestalt Switch Expeditions|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150221070425/http://www.gestaltswitchexpeditions.com/fluorescence-in-marine-orga/|archivedate=21 February 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Pumpkin toadlets that live in the Brazilian Atlantic forest are fluorescent.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.business-standard.com/article/pti-stories/fluorescence-discovered-in-tiny-brazilian-frogs-119032900584_1.html|title=Fluorescence discovered in tiny Brazilian frogs|last=India|first=Press Trust of|date=2019-03-29|work=Business Standard India|access-date=2019-03-30}}</ref>\n\n=====New Form of Biofluorescence=====\n\nIn a study published in the journal, iScience, a new form of biofluorescence described in two species of sharks, wherein it was due to undescribed group of brominated tryptophan-kynurenine small molecule metabolites.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Park|first=Hyun Bong|last2=Lam|first2=Yick Chong|last3=Gaffney|first3=Jean P.|last4=Weaver|first4=James C.|last5=Krivoshik|first5=Sara Rose|last6=Hamchand|first6=Randy|last7=Pieribone|first7=Vincent|last8=Gruber|first8=David F.|last9=Crawford|first9=Jason M.|date=2019-09-27|title=Bright Green Biofluorescence in Sharks Derives from Bromo-Kynurenine Metabolism|url=https://www.cell.com/iscience/abstract/S2589-0042(19)30244-5|journal=iScience|language=English|volume=19|pages=1291\u20131336|doi=10.1016/j.isci.2019.07.019|issn=2589-0042|pmid=31402257|pmc=6831821}}</ref>\n\n====Bioluminescence====\n[[Bioluminescence]] differs from fluorescence in that it is the natural production of light by chemical reactions within an organism, whereas fluorescence is the absorption and reemission of light from the environment.<ref name=\"Fluorescence in marine organisms\"/> A firefly and anglerfish are two example of bioluminescent organisms.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://earthnworld.com/top-10-amazing-bioluminescent-animals-planet-earth/|title=Top 10 Amazing Bioluminescent Animals on Planet Earth|last=Utsav|date=2017-12-02|website=Earth and World|language=en-US|access-date=2019-03-30}}</ref>\n\n====Phosphorescence====\n[[Phosphorescence|Biophosphorescence]] is similar to fluorescence in its requirement of light wavelengths as a provider of excitation energy.

Therefore, warm colors from the visual light spectrum appear less vibrant at increasing depths. Water scatters light of shorter wavelengths above violet, meaning cooler colors dominate the visual field in the [[photic zone]]. Light intensity decreases 10 fold with every 75 m of depth, so at depths of 75 m, light is 10% as intense as it is on the surface, and is only 1% as intense at 150 m as it is on the surface. Because the water filters out the wavelengths and intensity of water reaching certain depths, different proteins, because of the wavelengths and intensities of light they are capable of absorbing, are better suited to different depths. Theoretically, some fish eyes can detect light as deep as 1000 m. At these depths of the aphotic zone, the only sources of light are organisms themselves, giving off light through chemical reactions in a process called bioluminescence.\n\nFluorescence is simply defined as the absorption of electromagnetic radiation at one [[wavelength]] and its reemission at another, lower energy wavelength.<ref name=\"sparks\" /> Thus any type of fluorescence depends on the presence of external sources of light.

Therefore, individuals exhibiting strong fluorescence may be honest indicators of high individual quality, since they can deal with the associated costs.<ref>{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1126/science.295.5552.92| pmid = 11778040| title = Fluorescent Signaling in Parrots| journal = Science| volume = 295| issue = 5552| page = 92| year = 2002| last1 = Arnold| first1 = K.

Remarkably, spiders are the only known group in which fluorescence is \u201ctaxonomically widespread, variably expressed, evolutionarily labile, and probably under selection and potentially of ecological importance for intraspecific and interspecific signaling\". A study by Andrews et al. (2007) reveals that fluorescence has evolved multiple times across spider taxa, with novel fluorophores evolving during spider diversification. In some spiders, ultraviolet cues are important for predator-prey interactions, intraspecific communication, and camouflaging with matching fluorescent flowers. Differing ecological contexts could favor inhibition or enhancement of fluorescence expression, depending upon whether fluorescence helps spiders be cryptic or makes them more conspicuous to predators. Therefore, natural selection could be acting on expression of fluorescence across spider species.<ref>{{Cite journal\n | pmid = 17412670\n| pmc = 2104643\n| year = 2007\n| last1 = Andrews\n| first1 = K\n| title = Spiders fluoresce variably across many taxa\n| journal = Biology Letters\n| volume = 3\n| issue = 3\n| pages = 265\u20137\n| last2 = Reed\n| first2 = S.

[[Ruby|Rubies]], [[emerald]]s, and [[diamonds]] exhibit red fluorescence under long-wave UV, blue and sometimes green light; diamonds also emit light under [[X-ray]] radiation.\n\nFluorescence in minerals is caused by a wide range of activators. In some cases, the concentration of the activator must be restricted to below a certain level, to prevent quenching of the fluorescent emission. Furthermore, the mineral must be free of impurities such as iron or copper, to prevent quenching of possible fluorescence. Divalent [[manganese]], in concentrations of up to several percent, is responsible for the red or orange fluorescence of [[calcite]], the green fluorescence of [[willemite]], the yellow fluorescence of [[esperite]], and the orange fluorescence of [[wollastonite]] and [[clinohedrite]]. Hexavalent [[uranium]], in the form of the [[uranyl cation]], fluoresces at all concentrations in a yellow green, and is the cause of fluorescence of minerals such as [[autunite]] or [[andersonite]], and, at low concentration, is the cause of the fluorescence of such materials as some samples of [[hyalite]] opal. Trivalent [[chromium]] at low concentration is the source of the red fluorescence of [[ruby]]. Divalent [[europium]] is the source of the blue fluorescence, when seen in the mineral [[fluorite]]. Trivalent [[lanthanide]]s such as [[terbium]] and [[dysprosium]] are the principal activators of the creamy yellow fluorescence exhibited by the [[yttrofluorite]] variety of the mineral fluorite, and contribute to the orange fluorescence of [[zircon]]. [[Powellite]] ([[calcium molybdate]]) and [[scheelite]] (calcium tungstate) fluoresce intrinsically in yellow and blue, respectively. When present together in solid solution, energy is transferred from the higher-energy [[tungsten]] to the lower-energy [[molybdenum]], such that fairly low levels of [[molybdenum]] are sufficient to cause a yellow emission for [[scheelite]], instead of blue. Low-iron [[sphalerite]] (zinc sulfide), fluoresces and phosphoresces in a range of colors, influenced by the presence of various trace impurities.\n\nCrude oil ([[petroleum]]) fluoresces in a range of colors, from dull-brown for heavy oils and tars through to bright-yellowish and bluish-white for very light oils and condensates. This phenomenon is used in [[oil exploration]] drilling to identify very small amounts of oil in drill cuttings and core samples.\n\n====Organic liquids====\nOrganic solutions such [[anthracene]] or [[stilbene]], dissolved in [[benzene]] or [[toluene]], fluoresce with [[ultraviolet]] or [[gamma ray]] [[irradiation]].

An electric discharge in the tube causes the mercury atoms to emit mostly ultraviolet light. The tube is lined with a coating of a fluorescent material, called the ''[[phosphor]]'', which absorbs ultraviolet light and re-emits visible light. Fluorescent [[lighting]] is more energy-efficient than [[incandescent]] lighting elements. However, the uneven [[spectrum]] of traditional fluorescent lamps may cause certain colors to appear different than when illuminated by incandescent light or [[daylight]]. The mercury vapor emission spectrum is dominated by a short-wave UV line at 254&nbsp;nm (which provides most of the energy to the phosphors), accompanied by visible light emission at 436&nbsp;nm (blue), 546&nbsp;nm (green) and 579&nbsp;nm (yellow-orange). These three lines can be observed superimposed on the white continuum using a hand spectroscope, for light emitted by the usual white fluorescent tubes. These same visible lines, accompanied by the emission lines of trivalent europium and trivalent terbium, and further accompanied by the emission continuum of divalent europium in the blue region, comprise the more discontinuous light emission of the modern trichromatic phosphor systems used in many [[compact fluorescent lamp]] and traditional lamps where better color rendition is a goal.<ref name=\"How Fluorescent Lamps Work\">{{cite web|last=Harris|first=Tom|title=How Fluorescent Lamps Work|url=http://home.howstuffworks.com/fluorescent-lamp.htm|work=HowStuffWorks|publisher=Discovery Communications|accessdate=27 June 2010|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100706040948/http://home.howstuffworks.com/fluorescent-lamp.htm|archivedate=6 July 2010|df=dmy-all|date=2001-12-07}}</ref>\n\nFluorescent lights were first available to the public at the [[1939 New York World's Fair]].

Also, [[Thin layer chromatography|TLC]] plates can be visualized if the compounds or a coloring reagent is fluorescent. Fluorescence is most effective when there is a larger ratio of atoms at lower energy levels in a [[Boltzmann distribution]]. There is, then, a higher probability of excitement and release of photons by lower-energy atoms, making analysis more efficient.\n\n===Spectroscopy===\n{{Main|Fluorescence spectroscopy}}\nUsually the setup of a fluorescence assay involves a light source, which may emit many different wavelengths of light. In general, a single wavelength is required for proper analysis, so, in order to selectively filter the light, it is passed through an excitation monochromator, and then that chosen wavelength is passed through the sample cell. After absorption and re-emission of the energy, many wavelengths may emerge due to [[Stokes shift]] and various [[electron transition]]s. To separate and analyze them, the fluorescent radiation is passed through an emission [[monochromator]], and observed selectively by a detector.<ref>{{cite book|author=Harris, Daniel C.|title=Exploring chemical analysis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x5eEW76lizEC|date=2004|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=978-0-7167-0571-0|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160731220213/https://books.google.com/books?id=x5eEW76lizEC|archivedate=31 July 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Biochemistry and medicine===\n{{Main|Fluorescence in the life sciences}}\n[[Image:FluorescentCells.jpg|thumb|right|[[Endothelium|Endothelial cells]] under the microscope with three separate channels marking specific cellular components]]\nFluorescence in the life sciences is used generally as a non-destructive way of tracking or analysis of biological molecules by means of the fluorescent emission at a specific frequency where there is no background from the excitation light, as relatively few cellular components are naturally fluorescent (called intrinsic or [[autofluorescence]]).\nIn fact, a [[protein]] or other component can be \"labelled\" with an extrinsic [[fluorophore]], a fluorescent [[dye]] that can be a small molecule, protein, or quantum dot, finding a large use in many biological applications.<ref>[[#Lakowicz|Lakowicz]], p. xxvi</ref>\n\nThe quantification of a dye is done with a [[spectrofluorometer]] and finds additional applications in:\n\n====Microscopy====\n* When scanning the fluorescence intensity across a plane one has [[fluorescence microscope|fluorescence microscopy]] of tissues, cells, or subcellular structures, which is accomplished by labeling an antibody with a fluorophore and allowing the antibody to find its target antigen within the sample.
