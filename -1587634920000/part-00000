First, researchers aim to build a whole virus vaccine. The use of such a virus, be it [[inactivated vaccine|inactive]] or dead, aims to elicit a prompt [[immune response]] of the human body to a new infection with COVID\u201119. A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitises the immune system to certain subunits of the virus. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on the S-spike protein that helps the virus intrude the [[ACE2 enzyme]] receptor. A third strategy is that of the nucleic acid vaccines ([[DNA vaccination|DNA]] or [[RNA vaccines]], a novel technique for creating a vaccination).

The battle was fought at the same time as the [[Siege of Calais (1940)|Siege of Calais]], just before [[Operation Dynamo]], the evacuation of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) through [[Dunkirk]]. After the Franco-British counter-attack at the [[Battle of Arras (1940)|Battle of Arras]] on 21 May German units were held ready to resist a resumption of the attack on 22 May, despite the protests of General [[Heinz Guderian]], the commander of XIX Corps, who wanted to rush north up the Channel coast to capture Boulogne, Calais and Dunkirk. An attack by part of XIX Corps was not authorised until {{nowrap|12:40 p.m.}} on 22 May, by when the Allied troops at Boulogne had been reinforced from England by most of the [[20th Independent Infantry Brigade (Guards)|20th Guards Brigade]].\n\nThe Guards had time to dig in around the port before the [[2nd Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|2nd Panzer Division]], which had been delayed by French troops at [[Samer]], attacked the perimeter held by the Irish Guards at around {{nowrap|5:00 p.m.}} and were driven off after an hour of fighting. The Welsh Guards front was attacked at {{nowrap|8:00 p.m.}} and again at dusk before cutting off a party of the Irish at {{nowrap|10:00 p.m.}} At dawn on 23 May, the German attacks resumed, eventually pushing the defenders back into the town. About eighty light bombers of the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) flew in the defence of Boulogne.\n\nRoyal Navy ships shot their way into and out of the harbour and with French navy destroyers, bombarded German positions as wounded and non-combatants were embarked and a navy demolition party landed. During a lull in the afternoon of 23 May, the {{lang|de|[[Luftwaffe]]}} bombed the harbour, despite being intercepted by RAF fighters. At {{nowrap|6:30 p.m.}} the Guards Brigade was ordered to re-embark and the British destroyers ran the gauntlet of German tanks and artillery to evacuate them. The French defenders around the Citadel above the lower town could not be contacted and only in the morning of 24 May did General Lanquetot realise that the British had gone, which led to reproaches.\n\nThe French and remaining British troops held out until 25 May and then surrendered. Guderian wrote that the halt order and then the retention of considerable forces to guard against Allied counter-attacks, had forfeited an opportunity quickly to capture the [[Channel Ports]] and destroy the Allied forces in northern France and Belgium. An advance on Dunkirk began on 23 May but the next day was halted until 27 May; Dunkirk was not captured until 4 June, by when most of the BEF and many French and Belgian troops had escaped.\n\n==Background==\n\n===Boulogne===\n\n{{main|Boulogne-sur-Mer}}\n[[File:C\u00f4te d'Opale topographic map-fr.svg|thumb|{{centre|Map of the {{lang|fr|C\u00f4te d'Opale}}}}]]\nBoulogne-sur-Mer, [[Calais]], [[Dunkirk]] and [[Dieppe, Seine-Maritime|Dieppe]], are [[Channel Ports]] on the French side at the narrowest part of the English Channel. Boulogne is at the mouth of the fast-flowing [[Liane (river)|Liane]] river, which meanders through a valley. The harbour is on a level area of ground on either side of the river, well built-up and with steep roads uphill to the old town ({{lang|fr|Haute Ville}} or the Citadel). The rolling hills make for hidden approaches to the port and offer commanding high ground to an attacker, particularly the Mont St. Lambert ridge.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=155}} During the [[Phoney War]] {{nowrap|(September 1939 \u2013 10 May 1940)}}, the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) had been supplied through ports further to the west, such as [[Le Havre]] and [[Cherbourg]] but the Channel Ports came into use once mine barrages had been laid  in the [[English Channel]] in late 1939, to reduce the demand for ships and escorts. When leave from the BEF began in December, Boulogne was used for communication and for troop movements.{{sfnm|1a1=Ellis|1y=2004|1p=16|2a1=Bond|2a2=Taylor|2y=2001|2p=130}}\n\n===Battle of France===\n\n{{see also|Order of battle for the Battle of France|British Expeditionary Force order of battle (1940)}}\nOn 10 May 1940, the Germans began {{lang|de|[[Manstein Plan|Fall Gelb]]}} (Case Yellow) the offensive against France, Belgium and the Netherlands. Within a few days, the Germans achieved a breakthrough against the centre of the French front near [[Sedan, France|Sedan]] and drove westwards down the Somme river valley. As the BEF withdrew through Belgium into northern France, fewer supply troops were needed as the lines of communication shortened. The British began to withdraw surplus manpower through Boulogne and Calais and on 17 May, General [[Douglas Brownrigg]], the Adjutant-General of the BEF, moved the Rear General Headquarters (GHQ) from [[Arras]] to Boulogne without informing his French liaison officers.{{sfn|Sebag-Montefiore|2006|pp=188, 190}}{{efn|Relations among Franco-British commanders had been good until the German breakthrough on the Meuse, after which the British staff officers became apprehensive that they might be cut off from the coast, began slighting the liaison officers and withheld information.

The importance of holding the Channel Ports as the only means of supply and if necessary, evacuation, became vital for the Allies.{{sfnm|1a1=Churchill|1y=1949|1p=53|2a1=Ellis|2y=2004|2p=153}} Early in the morning of 21 May, Dutfoy ordered the naval garrison of {{nowrap|1,100 men}} to retire behind the medieval walls of the {{lang|de|Haute Ville}} (Old Town or Citadel), east of the Liane river.{{sfn|Sebag-Montefiore|2006|p=190}}\n\nAfter hearing alarmist reports of the approach of a large German force, apparently from General Jean Pelissier de F\u00e9ligonde, who had commanded a unit attacked by German tanks at Hesdin, {{convert|30|mi|km|abbr=on}} to the south-east of the port, Dutfoy ordered his men to disable the [[Coastal artillery]] in the forts and to head for the harbour for evacuation. Dutfoy left for Dunkirk and discipline broke down, looting took place and civilians waiting for places on evacuation ships began to panic until the commander in charge of the sea front threatened people with a gun. The commander decamped at {{nowrap|10:00 a.m.}} and the [[Touch hole|spiking]] of the naval guns continued until the order was questioned. Admiral Leclerc in Dunkirk was contacted, who ordered the remaining guns to be preserved for the defence of the town and visited Boulogne early on 22 May. Leclerc ordered the sailors to fight it out and wait for relief by the French and British armies.{{sfn|Sebag-Montefiore|2006|pp=190\u2013191}} Admiral [[Jean-Marie Charles Abrial|Jean Abrial]] at Dunkirk ordered\n\n{{quote|You are to die at your posts one by one rather than give in.{{sfn|Sebag-Montefiore|2006|pp=190\u2013192}}}}\n\n==Prelude==\n\n===Allied defensive preparations===\n\n{{see also|Siege of Calais (1940)#Siege of Calais|l1=Siege of Calais}}\n\n[[File:Map commune FR insee code 62160.png|thumb|{{centre|Modern map of Boulogne and vicinity (commune FR insee code 62160)}}]]\nA detachment of [[Royal Marines]] arrived in Boulogne in the early morning of 21 May.{{sfn|Jackson|2002|p=39}} Part of the [[20th Independent Infantry Brigade (Guards)|20th Guards Brigade]] ([[Brigadier]] [[William Fox-Pitt (British Army)|William Fox-Pitt]]), consisting of the 2nd Battalion, [[Welsh Guards]] and 2nd Battalion, [[Irish Guards]], was training at [[Camberley]] on 21 May, when ordered to embark for France.{{sfn|Thompson|2009|p=147}} With the brigade anti-tank company and a battery of 69th Anti-Tank Regiment, [[Royal Artillery]], the Guards arrived in Boulogne on the morning of 22 May on three merchant ships and the [[destroyer]] {{HMS|Vimy||6}}, escorted by the destroyers {{HMS|Whitshed|D77|6}} and {{HMS|Vimiera|1917|6}}.{{sfn|Thompson|2009|pp=147\u2013148}} The French [[21st Infantry Division (France)|21st Infantry Division]] (General [[Pierre Louis F\u00e9lix Lanquetot]]) was to hold a line between [[Samer]] and [[Desvres]], about {{convert|10|mi|km|abbr=on}} south of the town, where three battalions had already arrived.

The southern column made contact first in the early afternoon of 22 May, against the headquarters company of the French 48th Infantry Regiment, the only troops of the 21st Division who were between the Germans and Boulogne. The French clerks, drivers and signallers set up two {{nowrap|75 mm field}} guns and two {{nowrap|25 mm anti-tank}} guns to cover the cross-roads at [[Nesles]], where they delayed the Germans for almost two hours, until they were outflanked.{{sfn|Sebag-Montefiore|2006|p=192}} The column arrived at the outskirts of Boulogne in the evening and began shelling and probing the Irish Guards positions south of the town. The Irish knocked out the leading German tank and repulsed later attacks despite the Germans overrunning one of their forward platoons.

The 800 men of the AMPC force were rushed into the gap between the two Guards battalions and another 150 were sent to reinforce the Welsh Guards.

The battle was fought at the same time as the [[Siege of Calais (1940)|Siege of Calais]], just before [[Operation Dynamo]], the evacuation of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) through [[Dunkirk]]. After the Franco-British counter-attack at the [[Battle of Arras (1940)|Battle of Arras]] on 21 May German units were held ready to resist a resumption of the attack on 22 May, despite the protests of General [[Heinz Guderian]], the commander of XIX Corps, who wanted to rush north up the Channel coast to capture Boulogne, Calais and Dunkirk. An attack by part of XIX Corps was not authorised until {{nowrap|12:40 p.m.}} on 22 May, by when the Allied troops at Boulogne had been reinforced from England by most of the [[20th Independent Infantry Brigade (Guards)|20th Guards Brigade]].\n\nThe Guards had time to dig in around the port before the [[2nd Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|2nd Panzer Division]], which had been delayed by French troops at [[Samer]], attacked the perimeter held by the Irish Guards at around {{nowrap|5:00 p.m.}} and were driven off after an hour of fighting. The Welsh Guards front was attacked at {{nowrap|8:00 p.m.}} and again at dusk before cutting off a party of the Irish at {{nowrap|10:00 p.m.}} At dawn on 23 May, the German attacks resumed, eventually pushing the defenders back into the town. About eighty light bombers of the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) flew in the defence of Boulogne. \n\nRoyal Navy ships shot their way into and out of the harbour and with French navy destroyers, bombarded German positions as wounded and non-combatants were embarked and a navy demolition party landed. During a lull in the afternoon of 23 May, the {{lang|de|[[Luftwaffe]]}} bombed the harbour, despite being intercepted by RAF fighters. At {{nowrap|6:30 p.m.}} the Guards Brigade was ordered to re-embark and the British destroyers ran the gauntlet of German tanks and artillery to evacuate them. The French defenders around the Citadel above the lower town could not be contacted and only in the morning of 24 May did General Lanquetot realise that the British had gone, which led to reproaches.\n\nThe French and remaining British troops held out until 25 May and then surrendered. Guderian wrote that the halt order and then the retention of considerable forces to guard against Allied counter-attacks, had forfeited an opportunity quickly to capture the [[Channel Ports]] and destroy the Allied forces in northern France and Belgium. An advance on Dunkirk began on 23 May but the next day was halted until 27 May; Dunkirk was not captured until 4 June, by when most of the BEF and many French and Belgian troops had escaped.\n\n==Background==\n\n===Boulogne===\n\n{{main|Boulogne-sur-Mer}}\n[[File:C\u00f4te d'Opale topographic map-fr.svg|thumb|{{centre|Map of the {{lang|fr|C\u00f4te d'Opale}}}}]]\nBoulogne-sur-Mer, [[Calais]], [[Dunkirk]] and [[Dieppe, Seine-Maritime|Dieppe]], are [[Channel Ports]] on the French side at the narrowest part of the English Channel. Boulogne is at the mouth of the fast-flowing [[Liane (river)|Liane]] river, which meanders through a valley. The harbour is on a level area of ground on either side of the river, well built-up and with steep roads uphill to the old town ({{lang|fr|Haute Ville}} or the Citadel). The rolling hills make for hidden approaches to the port and offer commanding high ground to an attacker, particularly the Mont St. Lambert ridge.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=155}} During the [[Phoney War]] {{nowrap|(September 1939 \u2013 10 May 1940)}}, the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) had been supplied through ports further to the west, such as [[Le Havre]] and [[Cherbourg]] but the Channel Ports came into use once mine barrages had been laid  in the [[English Channel]] in late 1939, to reduce the demand for ships and escorts. When leave from the BEF began in December, Boulogne was used for communication and for troop movements.{{sfnm|1a1=Ellis|1y=2004|1p=16|2a1=Bond|2a2=Taylor|2y=2001|2p=130}}\n\n===Battle of France===\n\n{{see also|Order of battle for the Battle of France|British Expeditionary Force order of battle (1940)}}\nOn 10 May 1940, the Germans began {{lang|de|[[Manstein Plan|Fall Gelb]]}} (Case Yellow) the offensive against France, Belgium and the Netherlands. Within a few days, the Germans achieved a breakthrough against the centre of the French front near [[Sedan, France|Sedan]] and drove westwards down the Somme river valley. As the BEF withdrew through Belgium into northern France, fewer supply troops were needed as the lines of communication shortened. The British began to withdraw surplus manpower through Boulogne and Calais and on 17 May, General [[Douglas Brownrigg]], the Adjutant-General of the BEF, moved the Rear General Headquarters (GHQ) from [[Arras]] to Boulogne without informing his French liaison officers.{{sfn|Sebag-Montefiore|2006|pp=188, 190}}{{efn|Relations among Franco-British commanders had been good until the German breakthrough on the Meuse, after which the British staff officers became apprehensive that they might be cut off from the coast, began slighting the liaison officers and withheld information. The French liaison party left Boulogne after a {{lang|de|Luftwaffe}} air raid on the night of {{nowrap|19/20 May}} and reached Abbeville just before the Germans.{{sfn|Sebag-Montefiore|2006|pp=188, 190}}}} The Germans captured [[Abbeville]] at the mouth of the [[Somme River]] on 21 May, cutting off the Allied troops in Northern France and Belgium from their bases south of the river.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=153}}\n\nThe defence of Boulogne was the responsibility of the [[French Navy]] ({{lang|fr|Marine Nationale}}), which manned some 19th-century forts under the command of Commandant Dutfoy de Mont de Benque.{{sfn|Sebag-Montefiore|2006|p=190}} To protect Boulogne from air attack, eight [[QF 3.7-inch AA gun|3.7-inch anti-aircraft]] guns of the 2nd Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, eight machine-guns of the 58th Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment and a battery of the 2nd Searchlight Regiment had arrived from England on 20 May; the French had two {{nowrap|75 mm field}} guns, two {{nowrap|25 mm anti-tank}} guns and two tanks, one of which was unserviceable.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|pp=153, 385}} On 20 May, the leading elements of the German [[XIX Army Corps (Germany)|XIX Corps]], (General [[Heinz Guderian]]), reached Abbeville. The importance of holding the Channel Ports as the only means of supply and if necessary, evacuation, became vital for the Allies.{{sfnm|1a1=Churchill|1y=1949|1p=53|2a1=Ellis|2y=2004|2p=153}} Early in the morning of 21 May, Dutfoy ordered the naval garrison of {{nowrap|1,100 men}} to retire behind the medieval walls of the {{lang|de|Haute Ville}} (Old Town or Citadel), east of the Liane river.{{sfn|Sebag-Montefiore|2006|p=190}}\n\nAfter hearing alarmist reports of the approach of a large German force, apparently from General Jean Pelissier de F\u00e9ligonde, who had commanded a unit attacked by German tanks at Hesdin, {{convert|30|mi|km|abbr=on}} to the south-east of the port, Dutfoy ordered his men to disable the [[Coastal artillery]] in the forts and to head for the harbour for evacuation. Dutfoy left for Dunkirk and discipline broke down, looting took place and civilians waiting for places on evacuation ships began to panic until the commander in charge of the sea front threatened people with a gun. The commander decamped at {{nowrap|10:00 a.m.}} and the [[Touch hole|spiking]] of the naval guns continued until the order was questioned. Admiral Leclerc in Dunkirk was contacted, who ordered the remaining guns to be preserved for the defence of the town and visited Boulogne early on 22 May. Leclerc ordered the sailors to fight it out and wait for relief by the French and British armies.{{sfn|Sebag-Montefiore|2006|pp=190\u2013191}} Admiral [[Jean-Marie Charles Abrial|Jean Abrial]] at Dunkirk ordered\n\n{{quote|You are to die at your posts one by one rather than give in.{{sfn|Sebag-Montefiore|2006|pp=190\u2013192}}}}\n\n==Prelude==\n\n===Allied defensive preparations===\n\n{{see also|Siege of Calais (1940)#Siege of Calais|l1=Siege of Calais}}\n\n[[File:Map commune FR insee code 62160.png|thumb|{{centre|Modern map of Boulogne and vicinity (commune FR insee code 62160)}}]]\nA detachment of [[Royal Marines]] arrived in Boulogne in the early morning of 21 May.{{sfn|Jackson|2002|p=39}} Part of the [[20th Independent Infantry Brigade (Guards)|20th Guards Brigade]] ([[Brigadier]] [[William Fox-Pitt (British Army)|William Fox-Pitt]]), consisting of the 2nd Battalion, [[Welsh Guards]] and 2nd Battalion, [[Irish Guards]], was training at [[Camberley]] on 21 May, when ordered to embark for France.{{sfn|Thompson|2009|p=147}} With the brigade anti-tank company and a battery of 69th Anti-Tank Regiment, [[Royal Artillery]], the Guards arrived in Boulogne on the morning of 22 May on three merchant ships and the [[destroyer]] {{HMS|Vimy||6}}, escorted by the destroyers {{HMS|Whitshed|D77|6}} and {{HMS|Vimiera|1917|6}}.{{sfn|Thompson|2009|pp=147\u2013148}} The French [[21st Infantry Division (France)|21st Infantry Division]] (General [[Pierre Louis F\u00e9lix Lanquetot]]) was to hold a line between [[Samer]] and [[Desvres]], about {{convert|10|mi|km|abbr=on}} south of the town, where three battalions had already arrived. Further British reinforcements, including a regiment of [[cruiser tank]]s, were expected from Calais on the following day.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=154}}\n\nFox-Pitt deployed his men on the high ground outside the town, liaising with Lanquetot who organised the French troops in the town. The Irish Guards held the right flank to the south-west from the river at St. L\u00e9onard to the sea at Le Portel and the Welsh Guards the left flank north-east of the river on the west slopes of Mont Lambert ridge and high ground through St. Martin Boulogne, which made a defensive perimeter of {{cvt|6|mi|km|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Thompson|2009|p=148}} Road blocks had been established by a party of about fifty men of the 7th [[Queen's Own Royal West Kent Regiment|Royal West Kents]] from [[Albert, Somme|Albert]], about 100 men of the 262nd Field Company [[Royal Engineers]] and anti-aircraft crew held the right flank of the Welsh Guards, along the roads approaching from the south.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=155}} Fox-Pitt had left a gap in the perimeter between the Welsh left flank and the coast for the reinforcements expected from Calais.{{sfn|Thompson|2009|p=50}} There were 1,500 men of No 5 Group [[Auxiliary Military Pioneer Corps]] (AMPC) in the town awaiting evacuation, a mixture of recalled reservists and part-trained troops working as labourers.{{sfn|Jackson|2002|p=39}} Under French command were the fort garrisons and some French and Belgian training units of limited military value.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|pp=153\u2013154}} Lanquetot had told Fox-Pitt that the French forces in Boulogne were \"folded up\" which Fox-Pitt inferred meant that they ready to give up.{{sfn|Thompson|2009|p=150}}\n\n===German offensive preparations===\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1980-004-32, Heinz Guderian in Bouillon, Frankreich.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|{{centre|Guderian during the Battle of France}}]]\nThe Franco-British counter-attack at Arras led the Germans to continue to attack north towards the Channel Ports, rather than south over the Somme and late on 21 May, ''[[Oberkommando des Heeres]]'' (OKH) ordered ''Panzergruppe Kleist'' to advance about {{convert|50|mi|km|abbr=on}} north, to capture Boulogne and Calais.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=155}} Apprehension about another counter-attack led to the XV Corps (General [[Hermann Hoth]]) being held back, a division of the XLI Corps (Major-General [[Georg-Hans Reinhardt]]) being moved eastwards and the [[10th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|10th Panzer Division]] (Lieutenant-General [[Ferdinand Schaal]]) of XIX Corps was detached to guard against a counter-attack from the south. Parts of the [[1st Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|1st Panzer Division]] (Lieutenant-General [[Friedrich Kirchner]]) and [[2nd Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|2nd Panzer Division]] (Lieutenant-General [[Rudolf Veiel]]) were also held back to defend bridgeheads over the Somme.{{sfn|Cooper|1978|pp=227\u2013228}} The 2nd Panzer Division was ordered to advance to Boulogne on a line from [[Baincthun]] to Samer, with the 1st Panzer Division as a flank guard on the right, advancing to Desvres and [[Marquise, Pas-de-Calais|Marquise]] in case of a counter-attack from Calais.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=155}}\n\n==Battle==\n\n===22 May===\nThe 2nd Panzer Division formed two columns, one to circle round the town and attack from the north. The southern column made contact first in the early afternoon of 22 May, against the headquarters company of the French 48th Infantry Regiment, the only troops of the 21st Division who were between the Germans and Boulogne. The French clerks, drivers and signallers set up two {{nowrap|75 mm field}} guns and two {{nowrap|25 mm anti-tank}} guns to cover the cross-roads at [[Nesles]], where they delayed the Germans for almost two hours, until they were outflanked.{{sfn|Sebag-Montefiore|2006|p=192}} The column arrived at the outskirts of Boulogne in the evening and began shelling and probing the Irish Guards positions south of the town. The Irish knocked out the leading German tank and repulsed later attacks despite the Germans overrunning one of their forward platoons. In the early hours, the Germans attacked the Welsh Guards positions along the coast from the north-east as they began to envelop the town but were forced back each time.{{sfn|Thompson|2009|p=150}} Brownrigg, with Fox-Pitt's only communication link with England, departed with his staff at {{nowrap|3:00 a.m.}} on the destroyer {{HMS|Verity|D63|6}}, without informing the Guards. Only a few troops of the 21st Infantry Division were able take up its blocking positions near Desvres before the German advance reached them. The French managed to delay the 1st Panzer Division here for much of 22 May before Fox-Pitt was told at {{nowrap|4:00 a.m.}} that the French had fallen back to Boulogne by German tanks.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=156}} Most of the 21st Infantry Division, en route to Boulogne by train, was ambushed by German tanks and dispersed.{{sfn|Windsor Lewis|1940|nopp=y}}\n\n===23 May===\n[[File:HMS Venomous WWI IWM P 1975.jpg|thumb|{{centre|HMS ''Venomous'', one of the World War I vintage British destroyers used in the evacuation}}]]\nAn hour after dawn, [[Fort de la Cr\u00e8che]] near Wimereux, north of Boulogne, was captured by German troops. The possibility of reinforcement from Calais was thwarted by the appearance of German armour at the northern perimeter. Fox-Pitt realised that he would have to defend the port with only the two Guards battalions and the assorted French and British troops already there.{{sfn|Thompson|2009|p=150}} The AMPC was hastily combed for men with military experience and armed with rifles taken from the others. The 800 men of the AMPC force were rushed into the gap between the two Guards battalions and another 150 were sent to reinforce the Welsh Guards. The anti-aircraft gunners guarding the southern roads destroyed two German tanks with their 3.7-inch anti-aircraft guns and then retired.{{sfn|Thompson|2009|p=50}}\n\nThe Germans launched a pincer attack on the positions of the Welsh and Irish Guards and by {{nowrap|10:00 a.m.,}} the attack from the south, backed up by artillery and air support, had made the open slopes around the town untenable and forced the Guards back into the town.{{sfn|Thompson|2009|p=151}} [[8th Air Corps (Germany)|''Fliegerkorps'' VIII]] ({{lang|de|[[Generalmajor]]}} [[Wolfram Freiherr von Richthofen]]) sent {{lang|de|Stukas}} to destroy the fortifications at Boulogne which was of great help to the army{{sfn|Corum|2008|p=207}} ''Vimy'' arrived at noon with a naval demolition party and Force Buttercup, a [[Royal Marine]] shore party and began to embark wounded and the AMPC.

The retention of the 10th Panzer Division in reserve during the attacks on Boulogne and Calais, meant that the Aa Canal could not be attacked simultaneously. Had the panzers not been delayed, the preparations of the 20th Guards Brigade might have been interrupted. The long, exposed flank of [[Army Group A]], the uncertain German hold on Amiens and Abbeville and Allied possession of Arras, meant that the situation on 22 May could have changed.

Typically a practitioner will use an instrument such as a pendulum to perform analysis based on a map or photograph.\n\nThe practical application of radiesthesia is directed toward providing individual and environmental benefits, including:\n\n* Diagnosis of infirmities\n\n* Detection of underground water\n\n* Detection of underground mineral sources\n\n* Detection of the Earth\u2019s [[telluric current]]s and magnetic fields\n\n* Location of lost objects \n\n* Location of missing individuals or livestock \n\nA distinction may be made in the application of radiesthesic  techniques in the detection of physical phenomena eg water, minerals, objects, changed cell condition and using these techniques for analysis of supposed subtle energy fields or the \u2018aura\u2019 of an individual \n\nResearchers have cited an involuntary bodily reaction ie [[ideomotor phenomenon]] as the initiator of the movement seen occurring in instruments such as dowsing rods or a pendulum. It is this reactive movement which typically acts as the indicator of the location of the state change of the subject under investigation.\n\n== External Links ==\n\n* [http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/ideomotor.html Ray Hyman.

''Bos indicus'' (or ''[[Bos taurus indicus]]'') cattle, commonly called zebu, are adapted to hot climates and originated in the tropical parts of the world such as sub-Saharan Africa, India, China, and Southeast Asia.  ''Bos taurus'' (or ''[[Bos taurus taurus]]''), typically referred to as \"taurine\" cattle, are generally adapted to cooler climates and include almost all cattle breeds originating from Europe, the Mediterranean region, and northern Asia. Both species were likely present since ancient times in northern Africa and the Middle East, where both natural and human-caused hybridization likely occurred. Today, ''Taurus/indicus'' hybrids are widely bred in many warmer regions, combining characteristics of both the ancestral types (such as the [[Sanga cattle]] of Africa, or Brangus [a portmanteau of Brahma and Angus] in warmer regions of the United States).\n\nIn some parts of the world further species of cattle are found (both as wild and domesticated animals), and some of these are related so closely to taurine and indicus cattle that inter[[species]] [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrids]] have been bred.  Examples include the [[Dwarf Lulu]] cattle of the mountains of [[Nepal]] with [[yak]] blood,<ref>{{cite journal|title=Mitochondrial DNA analysis of Nepalese domestic dwarf cattle Lulu|last=Takeda|first=K.|author2=Satoh M. |author3=Neopane S.P. |author4=Kuwar B.S. |author5=Joshi H.D. |author6=Shrestha N.P. |author7=Fujise H. |author8=Tasai M. |author9=Tagami T. |author10= Hanada H. |journal=Animal Science Journal|volume=75|issue=2|date=April 2004|pages=103\u2013110(8)|doi=10.1111/j.1740-0929.2004.00163.x}}</ref> the [[Beefalo]] of North America with [[bison]] genes, the [[Selembu]] breed of [[India]] and [[Bhutan]] with [[gayal]] genes.

''Bos indicus'' (or ''[[Bos taurus indicus]]'') cattle, commonly called zebu, are adapted to hot climates and originated in the tropical parts of the world such as sub-Saharan Africa, India, China, and Southeast Asia.  ''Bos taurus'' (or ''[[Bos taurus taurus]]''), typically referred to as \"taurine\" cattle, are generally adapted to cooler climates and include almost all cattle breeds originating from Europe, the Mediterranean region, and northern Asia. Both species were likely present since ancient times in northern Africa and the Middle East, where both natural and human-caused hybridization likely occurred. Today, ''Taurus/indicus'' hybrids are widely bred in many warmer regions, combining characteristics of both the ancestral types (such as the [[Sanga cattle]] of Africa, or Brangus [a portmanteau of Brahma and Angus] in warmer regions of the United States).\n\nIn some parts of the world further species of cattle are found (both as wild and domesticated animals), and some of these are related so closely to taurine and indicus cattle that inter[[species]] [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrids]] have been bred.  Examples include the [[Dwarf Lulu]] cattle of the mountains of [[Nepal]] with [[yak]] blood,<ref>{{cite journal|title=Mitochondrial DNA analysis of Nepalese domestic dwarf cattle Lulu|last=Takeda|first=K.|author2=Satoh M. |author3=Neopane S.P. |author4=Kuwar B.S. |author5=Joshi H.D. |author6=Shrestha N.P. |author7=Fujise H. |author8=Tasai M. |author9=Tagami T. |author10= Hanada H. |journal=Animal Science Journal|volume=75|issue=2|date=April 2004|pages=103\u2013110(8)|doi=10.1111/j.1740-0929.2004.00163.x}}</ref> the [[Beefalo]] of North America with [[bison]] genes, the [[Selembu]] breed of [[India]] and [[Bhutan]] with [[gayal]] genes.

In emphasizing the magnitude of the difference between the two alternative definitions, Williamson has argued (see {{section link||Origins of policy agenda}} and {{section link||Broad sense}} below) that his ten original, narrowly defined prescriptions have largely acquired the status of \"motherhood and apple pie\" (i.e., are broadly taken for granted), whereas the subsequent broader definition, representing a form of neoliberal manifesto, \"never enjoyed a consensus [in Washington] or anywhere much else\" and can reasonably be said to be dead.\n\nDiscussion of the Washington Consensus has long been contentious. Partly this reflects a lack of agreement over what is meant by the term, but there are also substantive differences over the merits and consequences of the policy prescriptions involved. Some critics take issue with the original Consensus's emphasis on the opening of developing countries to global markets, and/or with what they see as an excessive focus on strengthening the influence of domestic market forces, arguably at the expense of key functions of the state. For other commentators, the issue is more what is ''missing'', including such areas as institution-building and targeted efforts to improve opportunities for the weakest in society.\n\n==History==\n\n===Original sense: Williamson's Ten Points===\nThe concept and name of the Washington Consensus were first presented in 1989 by [[John Williamson (economist)|John Williamson]], an economist from the [[Institute for International Economics]], an international economic [[think tank]] based in Washington, D.C.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iie.com/content/?ID=1#topic3 |title=A Guide To John Williamson's Writing |last1=Williamson |first1=John |website=www.piie.com |publisher=[[Peterson Institute for International Economics]] |accessdate=April 24, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150705172400/http://www.iie.com/content/?ID=1#topic3 |archivedate=July 5, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Williamson used the term to summarize commonly shared themes among policy advice by Washington-based institutions at the time, such as the International Monetary Fund, World Bank, and U.S. Treasury Department, which were believed to be necessary for the recovery of countries in Latin America from the economic and financial crises of the 1980s.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nThe consensus as originally stated by Williamson included ten broad sets of relatively specific policy recommendations:<ref name=\"piie.com\"/>\n# [[Fiscal policy]] discipline, with avoidance of large fiscal deficits relative to GDP;\n# Redirection of public spending from subsidies (\"especially indiscriminate subsidies\") toward broad-based provision of key pro-growth, pro-poor services like primary education, [[primary health care]] and infrastructure investment;\n# [[Tax reform]], broadening the tax base and adopting moderate marginal tax rates;\n# [[Interest rate]]s that are market determined and positive (but moderate) in real terms;\n# Competitive [[exchange rate]]s;\n# [[Trade liberalization]]: liberalization of imports, with particular emphasis on elimination of quantitative restrictions (licensing, etc.); any trade protection to be provided by low and relatively uniform [[tariff]]s;\n# Liberalization of inward [[foreign direct investment]];\n# [[Privatization]] of [[State-owned enterprise|state enterprise]]s;\n# [[Deregulation]]: abolition of regulations that impede market entry or restrict competition, except for those justified on safety, environmental and consumer protection grounds, and prudential oversight of [[financial institution]]s;\n# Legal security for [[property right]]s.\n\n===Origins of policy agenda===\nAlthough Williamson's label of the ''Washington'' Consensus draws attention to the role of the Washington-based agencies in promoting the above agenda, a number of authors have stressed that Latin American policy-makers arrived at their own packages of policy reforms primarily based on their own analysis of their countries' situations. Thus, according to [[Joseph Stanislaw]] and [[Daniel Yergin]], authors of ''[[The Commanding Heights]]'', the policy prescriptions described in the Washington Consensus were \"developed in Latin America, by Latin Americans, in response to what was happening both within and outside the region.\"<ref name=\"Yergin and Stanislaw\">{{cite book|last1=Yergin|first1=Daniel|last2=Stanislaw|first2=Joseph|authorlink1=Daniel Yergin|authorlink2=Joseph Stanislaw|title=The Commanding Heights: The Battle for the World Economy|date=2002|publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]]|location=New York City|isbn=9780743229630|page=[https://archive.org/details/commandingheight00yerg_1/page/237 237]|url=https://archive.org/details/commandingheight00yerg_1|url-access=registration|accessdate=July 3, 2015}}</ref> Joseph Stiglitz has written that \"the Washington Consensus policies were designed to respond to the very real problems in Latin America and made considerable sense\" (though Stiglitz has at times been an outspoken critic of IMF policies as applied to developing nations).<ref>Joseph Stiglitz, ''Globalization and its Discontents'' (2002), p. 53.</ref> In view of the implication conveyed by the term Washington Consensus that the policies were largely external in origin, Stanislaw and Yergin report that the term's creator, John Williamson, has \"regretted the term ever since\", stating \"it is difficult to think of a less diplomatic label.\"<ref name=\"Yergin and Stanislaw\"/>\n\nA 2010 paper by [[Nancy Birdsall]], [[Augusto de la Torre]], and [[Felipe Valencia Caicedo]] likewise suggests that the policies in the original consensus were largely a creation of Latin American politicians and technocrats, with Williamson's role having been to gather the ten points in one place for the first time, rather than to \"create\" the package of policies.<ref name = \"damaged\">{{cite web\n|url= http://www.cgdev.org/content/publications/detail/1424155\n|title= The Washington Consensus: Assessing a Damaged Brand\u2014Working Paper 213\n|publisher= [[Center for Global Development]]\n|author1=Nancy Birdsall |author2=Augusto de la Torre |author3=Felipe Valencia Caicedo  |last-author-amp=yes |date = April 6, 2010\n|accessdate=2010-11-17}}\n</ref>\n\nIn Williamson's own words from 2002:\n\n{{quote|<poem>It is difficult even for the creator of the term to deny that the phrase \"Washington Consensus\" is a damaged brand name (Na\u00edm 2002).

There are people who cannot utter the term without foaming at the mouth.\n\nMy own view is of course quite different. The basic ideas that I attempted to summarize in the Washington Consensus have continued to gain wider acceptance over the past decade, to the point where [[Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva|Lula]] has had to endorse most of them in order to be electable. For the most part they are motherhood and apple pie, which is why they commanded a consensus.<ref name=Williamson2002/></poem>}}\n\n===Broad sense===\nWilliamson recognizes that the term has commonly been used with a different meaning from his original prescription; he opposes the alternative use of the term, which became common after his initial formulation, to cover a broader market fundamentalism or \"[[neoliberal]]\" agenda.<ref>Mois\u00e9s Na\u00edm, [http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/seminar/1999/reforms/Naim.HTM ''Fads and Fashion in Economic Reforms: Washington Consensus or Washington Confusion?''].

He argues that one of the least controversial prescriptions, the redirection of spending to infrastructure, health care, and education, has often been neglected. He also argues that, while the prescriptions were focused on reducing certain functions of government (e.g., as an owner of productive enterprises), they would also strengthen government's ability to undertake other actions such as supporting education and health. Williamson says that he does not endorse market fundamentalism, and believes that the Consensus prescriptions, if implemented correctly, would benefit the poor.<ref name=Williamson2000 /> In a book edited with Pedro-Pablo Kuczynski in 2003, Williamson laid out an expanded reform agenda, emphasizing crisis-proofing of economies, \"second-generation\" reforms, and policies addressing inequality and social issues (Kuczynski and Williamson, 2003).{{Full citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nAs noted, in spite of Williamson's reservations, the term Washington Consensus has been used more broadly to describe the general shift towards free market policies that followed the [[Post-war displacement of Keynesianism|displacement of Keynesianism]] in the 1970s. In this broad sense the Washington Consensus is sometimes considered to have begun at about 1980.<ref name = \"GPE\">{{Cite book\n  | editor = John Ravenhill\n  | author1 = Eric Helleiner\n  | author2 = Louis W.

He attributes this limited impact to three factors: (a) the Consensus ''per se'' placed no special emphasis on mechanisms for avoiding economic crises, which have proved very damaging; (b) the reforms\u2014both those listed in his article and, ''a fortiori'', those actually implemented\u2014were incomplete; and (c) the reforms cited were insufficiently ambitious with respect to targeting improvements in income distribution, and need to be complemented by stronger efforts in this direction.

The crisis had multiple origins: the drastic rise in the price of imported oil following the emergence of [[OPEC]], mounting levels of external debt, the rise in US (and hence international) interest rates, and\u2014consequent to the foregoing problems\u2014loss of access to additional foreign credit. The import-substitution policies that had been pursued by many developing country governments in Latin America and elsewhere for several decades had left their economies ill-equipped to expand exports at all quickly to pay for the additional cost of imported oil (by contrast, many countries in East Asia, which had followed more [[export-oriented industrialization|export-oriented strategies]], found it comparatively easy to expand exports still further, and as such managed to accommodate the external shocks with much less economic and social disruption). Unable either to expand external borrowing further or to ramp up export earnings easily, many Latin American countries faced no obvious sustainable alternatives to reducing overall domestic demand via greater fiscal discipline, while in parallel adopting policies to reduce protectionism and increase their economies' export orientation.<ref>See e.g., Patrice Franko, \"The Puzzle of Latin American Development\" (3rd edition, 2007), or Michael Read, \"Forgotten Continent\" (2007).</ref>\n\n==Trade liberalization==\nThe Washington Consensus, as framed by Williamson, envisaged a largely ''unilateral'' process of trade reform, by which countries would lower their non-tariff (especially) and tariff barriers to imports. Many countries, including the majority of those in Latin America, have indeed undertaken significant unilateral trade liberalization over subsequent years, opening their economies to greater import competition while simultaneously increasing the share of exports in their GDP (in parallel, Latin America's share in global trade has also increased).{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nA separate agenda\u2014only tangentially related to the Washington Consensus as framed by Williamson\u2014concerns various programs for ''multilateral'' trade liberalization, whether at the global (WTO) or regional level, including the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) and [[DR-CAFTA]] agreements.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n==Criticism==\nMost criticism has been focused on trade liberalization and the elimination of subsidies, and criticism has been particularly strident in the agriculture sector.

Other Latin American countries with governments of the left, including Brazil, Chile and Peru, in practice adopted the bulk of the policies included in Williamson's list, even though they criticized the market fundamentalism that these are often associated with. Also critical of the policies as actually promoted by the IMF have been some US economists, such as [[Joseph Stiglitz]] and [[Dani Rodrik]], who have challenged what are sometimes described as the 'fundamentalist' policies of the IMF and the [[US Treasury]] for what Stiglitz calls a 'one size fits all' treatment of individual economies.

Kuntz asserts in his research about the health care system of Yugoslavia before and after the war that the economic pressure Yugoslavs faced as a result of the high-interest, short-term commercial loans the government took under great internal , and external, pressure for liberalization helped to fuel the discontent within the ethnic groups throughout the republic.<ref>{{Cite journal |pmc = 1448556|year = 2004|last1 = Kunitz|first1 = S.

This helped ignite the push for independence for both republics in the coming years. These nations leaving the Yugoslavian SFR blew a catastrophic blow to the GDP of the remaining republics. This new economic reality was one of total desperation and in its wake arose fierce nationalism in the ethnic groups of Yugoslavia. Most notably, it saw the rise of radical, racist Serb leaders into the Bosnian government.\n\nThese leaders shared the desire to create a greater Serbia via the ethnic cleansing of the Croats, Slovenes, and Bosniaks who lived throughout the republic. Extremist Bosnia-Serbs began using the turmoil and economic hardship to encourage hatred and violence against non-Serb ethnicities. This would culminate in the first European genocide since the Holocaust as radical Bosnian-Serbs leaders in both civilian and military roles used centuries-old prejudices against Bosniak Muslims to justify a series of large-scale massacres to remove the Bosniak communities.  \n\nKuntz identifies that there is a link between Western economic policies and a noticeable increase in the ethnic tensions that would engulf the entire country. \n\n===Anti-globalization movement===\nMany critics of [[trade liberalization]], such as [[Noam Chomsky]], [[Tariq Ali]], [[Susan George (political scientist)|Susan George]], and [[Naomi Klein]], see the Washington Consensus as a way to open the [[labor market]] of underdeveloped economies to exploitation by companies from more developed economies. The prescribed reductions in tariffs and other [[trade barrier]]s allow the free movement of goods across borders according to [[market forces]], but labor is not permitted to move freely due to the requirements of a [[Visa (document)|visa]] or a work permit. This creates an economic climate where goods are manufactured using cheap labor in underdeveloped economies and then exported to rich First World economies for sale at what the critics argue are huge markups, with the balance of the markup said to accrue to large multinational corporations. The criticism is that workers in the [[Third World]] economy nevertheless remain poor, as any pay raises they may have received over what they made before trade liberalization are said to be offset by inflation, whereas workers in the First World country become unemployed, while the wealthy owners of the multinational grow even more wealthy.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Profit over people : neoliberalism and global order|last=Noam.|first=Chomsky|date=1999|publisher=Seven Stories Press|isbn=9781888363821|oclc=39505718}}</ref>\n\n[[Anti-globalization movement|Anti-globalism]] critics further claim that First World countries impose what the critics describe as the consensus's neoliberal policies on economically vulnerable countries through organizations such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund and by political pressure and bribery. They argue that the Washington Consensus has not, in fact, led to any great economic boom in Latin America, but rather to severe economic crises and the accumulation of crippling [[external debt]]s that render the target country beholden to the First World.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nMany of the policy prescriptions (e.g., the privatization of state industries, tax reform, and deregulation) are criticized as mechanisms for ensuring the development of a small, wealthy, indigenous elite in the Third World who will rise to political power and also have a vested interest in maintaining the local status quo of labor exploitation.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nSome specific factual premises of the critique as phrased above (especially on the macroeconomic side) are not accepted by defenders, or indeed all critics, of the Washington Consensus. To take a few examples,<ref>\"Statistical Yearbook for Latin America and the Caribbean\" (annual). UN Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean.</ref> inflation in many developing countries is now at its lowest levels for many decades (low single figures for very much of Latin America). Workers in some factories created by foreign investment are found typically to receive higher wages and better working conditions than exist in many of their own countries' domestically owned workplaces. Economic growth in much of Latin America in the last few years has been at historically high rates, and debt levels, relative to the size of these economies, are on average significantly lower than they were several years ago.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\nDespite these macroeconomic advances, poverty and inequality remain at high levels in Latin America. About one of every three people\u2014165&nbsp;million in total\u2014still live on less than $2 a day. Roughly a third of the population has no access to electricity or basic sanitation, and an estimated 10 million children suffer from malnutrition. These problems are not, however, new: Latin America was the most economically unequal region in the world in 1950, and has continued to be so ever since, during periods both of state-directed import-substitution and (subsequently) of market-oriented liberalization.<ref>Michael Read, \"Forgotten Continent\" (2007), page 156.</ref>\n\nSome socialist political leaders in Latin America have been vocal and well-known critics of the Washington Consensus, such as the late Venezuelan President [[Hugo Ch\u00e1vez]], Cuban ex-President [[Fidel Castro]], Bolivian President [[Evo Morales]], and [[Rafael Correa]], President of [[Ecuador]]. In Argentina, too, the recent [[Justicialist Party]] government of [[N\u00e9stor Kirchner]] and [[Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner]] undertook policy measures which represented a repudiation of at least some Consensus policies (see Continuing Controversy below). With the exception of Castro, these leaders have maintained and expanded some successful policies commonly associated with the Washington Consensus, such as macroeconomic stability and property rights protection. But many have also proposed and implemented policies directly opposed to the Washington Consensus: under Chavez, for example, Venezuela partially nationalized the state-run oil company, [[PDVSA|Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela S.A]] (PdVSA), and with the help of the company's assets developed several social programs to help the country's poor. These programs have been credited with the dramatic improvement in quality of life during Chavez's presidency: the poverty rate dropped from 48.6% in 2002 to 29.5% in 2011, while access to education and healthcare was significantly increased.<ref>Charlie Devereux and Raymond Colitt, [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-03-07/venezuelans-quality-of-life-improved-in-un-index-under-chavez.html Venezuelans\u2019 Quality of Life Improved in UN Index Under Chavez.] Bloomberg News May 7, 2013.</ref>\n\nOthers on the Latin American left take a different approach.  Governments led by the Socialist Party of [[Chile]], by [[Alan Garc\u00eda]] in Peru, by [[Tabar\u00e9 V\u00e1zquez]] in Uruguay, and by [[Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva]] in Brazil, have in practice maintained a high degree of continuity with the economic policies described under the Washington Consensus (debt-paying, protection to foreign investment, financial reforms, etc.). But governments of this type have simultaneously sought to supplement these policies by measures directly targeted at improving productivity and helping the poor, such as education reforms and subsidies to poor families conditioned on their children staying in school.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n===Neo-Keynesian criticisms===\n[[Neo-Keynesian economics|Neo-Keynesian]] and [[Post-Keynesian economics|post-Keynesian]] critics of the Consensus{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} have argued that the underlying policies were incorrectly laid down and are too rigid to be able to succeed. For example, flexible [[labor law]]s were supposed to [[job creation|create new jobs]], but economic evidence from Latin America is inconclusive on this point.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} In addition, some argue that the package of policies does not take into account economic and cultural differences between countries.{{by whom|date=July 2015}} Some critics have argued that this set of policies should be implemented, if at all, during a period of rapid economic growth and not\u2014as often is the case\u2014during an [[economic crisis]].{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n[[Mois\u00e9s Na\u00edm]], chief editor of ''[[Foreign Policy]]'', has made the argument that there was no consensus in the first place.

This definition leaves some room for debate over specific public spending programs. One area of public controversy has focused on the issues of subsidies to farmers for fertilizers and other modern farm inputs: on the one hand, these can be criticized as subsidies, on the other, it may be argued that they generate positive externalities that might justify the subsidy involved.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nSome critics of the Washington Consensus cite Malawi's experience with [[agricultural subsidy|agricultural subsidies]], for example, as exemplifying perceived flaws in the package's prescriptions. For decades, the World Bank and donor nations pressed [[Malawi]], a predominantly rural country in Africa, to cut back or eliminate government fertilizer subsidies to farmers. World Bank experts also urged the country to have Malawi farmers shift to growing cash crops for export and to use foreign exchange earnings to import food.<ref name=\"nytimes.com\">New York Times, 2007 December 2, \"[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/02/world/africa/02malawi.html?em&ex=1196744400&en=8dc6209db5ec0efe&ei=5087%0A Ending Famine, Simply by Ignoring the Experts]\"</ref> For years, Malawi hovered on the brink of famine; after a particularly disastrous corn harvest in 2005, almost five million of its 13 million people needed emergency food aid. Malawi's newly elected president [[Bingu wa Mutharika]] then decided to reverse policy. Introduction of deep fertilizer subsidies (and lesser ones for seed), abetted by good rains, helped farmers produce record-breaking corn harvests in 2006 and 2007; according to government reports, corn production leapt from 1.2&nbsp;million metric tons in 2005 to 2.7&nbsp;million in 2006 and 3.4&nbsp;million in 2007.  The prevalence of acute child hunger has fallen sharply and Malawi recently turned away emergency food aid.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_cleansing_in_the_Bosnian_War\nIn a commentary on the Malawi experience prepared for the [[Center for Global Development]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cgdev.org/blog/value-rejecting-expert-advice |title=Global Development: Views from the Center: The Value of Rejecting Expert Advice |author=Vijaya Ramachandran |date=July 7, 2012 |website=cgdev.org |publisher=Center for Global Development |access-date=April 24, 2015}}</ref> development economists Vijaya Ramachandran and Peter Timmer argue that fertilizer subsidies in parts of Africa (and Indonesia) can have benefits that substantially exceed their costs. They caution, however, that how the subsidy is operated is crucial to its long-term success, and warn against allowing fertilizer distribution to become a monopoly.  Ramachandran and Timmer also stress that African farmers need more than just input subsidies\u2014they need better research to develop new inputs and new seeds, as well as better transport and energy infrastructure. The World Bank reportedly now sometimes supports the temporary use of fertilizer subsidies aimed at the poor and carried out in a way that fosters private markets: \"In Malawi, Bank officials say they generally support Malawi's policy, though they criticize the government for not having a strategy to eventually end the subsidies, question whether its 2007 corn production estimates are inflated and say there is still a lot of room for improvement in how the subsidy is carried out\".<ref name=\"nytimes.com\"/>\n\n==Continuing controversy==\n\nMost Latin American countries continue to struggle with high poverty and [[underemployment]]. Chile has been offered as an example of a Consensus success story, and countries such as [[El Salvador]] and Panama have also shown some positive signs of economic development. Brazil, despite relatively modest rates of aggregate growth, has seen important progress in recent years in the reduction of poverty. This is counterweight, since the last two Brazilian [[Dilma Rousseff|socialist presidents]] have adjusted modest socialist reforms.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nJoseph Stiglitz has argued that the Chilean success story owes a lot to state ownership of key industries, particularly [[Codelco|its]] copper industry, and [[currency intervention]]s stabilizing capital flows. Many other economists, though, argue that Chile's economic success is largely due to its combination of sound macroeconomics and market-oriented policies (though the country's relatively strong public institutions, including one of the better public school systems in the region, also deserve some credit).<ref>See, e.g., Martinez and Diaz, \"Chile: the Great Transformation\" (1995).</ref>\n\nThere have been claims of discrepancies between the Washington Consensus as propounded by Williamson, and the policies actually implemented with the endorsement of the Washington institutions themselves. For example, the Washington Consensus stated a need for investment in education, but the policies of fiscal discipline promoted by the International Monetary Fund have sometimes in practice led countries to cut back public spending on social programs, including such areas as basic education. Those familiar with the work of the IMF respond that, at a certain stage, countries near bankruptcy have to cut back their public spending one way or another to live within their means.<ref>[http://econ161.berkeley.edu/Politics/Fischer_Asia.html Stanley Fischer on the IMF and East Asia<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Washington may argue for enlightened choices among different public spending priorities, but in the last analysis it is domestically elected political leaders who ultimately have to make the tough political choices.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n==Missing elements==\nA significant body of economists and policy-makers argues that what was wrong with the Washington Consensus as originally formulated by Williamson had less to do with what was ''included'' than with what was ''missing''.<ref>See, as examples representative of a much more extensive literature, e.g., Birdsall and de la Torre. ''Washington Contentious'' (2003); Kuczynski and Williamson (eds.), ''After the Washington Consensus'' (2003).</ref> This view asserts that countries such as Brazil, Chile, Peru and Uruguay, largely governed by parties of the left in recent years, did not\u2014whatever their rhetoric\u2014in practice abandon most of the substantive elements of the Consensus. Countries that have achieved macroeconomic stability through fiscal and monetary discipline have been loath to abandon it: Lula, the former President of Brazil (and former leader of the [[Workers' Party (Brazil)|Workers' Party of Brazil]]), has stated explicitly that the defeat of [[hyperinflation]]<ref>http://www.econ.puc-rio.br/gfranco/How%20Brazil%20Beat%20Hyperinflation.htm</ref> was among the most important positive contributions of the years of his presidency to the welfare of the country's poor, although the remaining influence of his policies on tackling poverty and maintaining a steady low rate of inflation are being discussed and doubted in the wake of the Brazilian Economic Crisis currently occurring in Brazil.<ref>https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-10-06/imf-says-brazil-economy-to-shrink-3-in-2015-on-political-crisis</ref>\n\nThese economists and policy-makers would, however, overwhelmingly agree that the Washington Consensus was ''incomplete'', and that countries in Latin America and elsewhere need to move beyond \"first generation\" macroeconomic and trade reforms to a stronger focus on [[productivity]]-boosting reforms and direct programs to support the poor.<ref>See, e.g., Birdsall and de la Torre, ''Washington Contentious'' (2003); de Ferranti and Ody, [http://www.brookings.edu/views/papers/20060803.pdf ''Key Economic and Social Challenges for Latin America''] (2006):</ref> This includes improving the investment climate and eliminating [[red tape]] (especially for smaller firms), strengthening institutions (in areas like justice systems), fighting poverty directly via the types of [[Conditional Cash Transfer]] programs adopted by countries like Mexico and Brazil, improving the quality of primary and secondary education, boosting countries' effectiveness at developing and absorbing technology, and addressing the special needs of historically disadvantaged groups including [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous peoples]] and [[Afro-Latin American|Afro-descendant]] populations across Latin America.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n==Alternative usage vis-\u00e0-vis foreign policy==\nIn early 2008, the term \"Washington Consensus\" was used in a different sense as a metric for analyzing American [[mainstream media]] coverage of U.S. [[foreign policy]] generally and Middle East policy specifically. Marda Dunsky writes, \"Time and again, with exceedingly rare exceptions, the media repeat without question, and fail to challenge the \"Washington consensus\"\u2014the official mind-set of US governments on Middle East peacemaking over time.\"<ref>Marda Dunsky, ''Pens and Swords: How the Mainstream Media Report the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict'', 2008, [[Columbia University Press]], {{ISBN|978-0-231-13349-4}}, p.36</ref> According to syndicated columnist [[William Pfaff]], Beltway centrism in American mainstream media coverage of foreign affairs is the rule rather than the exception: \"Coverage of international affairs in the US is almost entirely Washington-driven.

In emphasizing the magnitude of the difference between the two alternative definitions, Williamson has argued (see {{section link||Origins of policy agenda}} and {{section link||Broad sense}} below) that his ten original, narrowly defined prescriptions have largely acquired the status of \"motherhood and apple pie\" (i.e., are broadly taken for granted), whereas the subsequent broader definition, representing a form of neoliberal manifesto, \"never enjoyed a consensus [in Washington] or anywhere much else\" and can reasonably be said to be dead.\n\nDiscussion of the Washington Consensus has long been contentious. Partly this reflects a lack of agreement over what is meant by the term, but there are also substantive differences over the merits and consequences of the policy prescriptions involved. Some critics take issue with the original Consensus's emphasis on the opening of developing countries to global markets, and/or with what they see as an excessive focus on strengthening the influence of domestic market forces, arguably at the expense of key functions of the state. For other commentators, the issue is more what is ''missing'', including such areas as institution-building and targeted efforts to improve opportunities for the weakest in society.\n\n==History==\n\n===Original sense: Williamson's Ten Points===\nThe concept and name of the Washington Consensus were first presented in 1989 by [[John Williamson (economist)|John Williamson]], an economist from the [[Institute for International Economics]], an international economic [[think tank]] based in Washington, D.C.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iie.com/content/?ID=1#topic3 |title=A Guide To John Williamson's Writing |last1=Williamson |first1=John |website=www.piie.com |publisher=[[Peterson Institute for International Economics]] |accessdate=April 24, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150705172400/http://www.iie.com/content/?ID=1#topic3 |archivedate=July 5, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Williamson used the term to summarize commonly shared themes among policy advice by Washington-based institutions at the time, such as the International Monetary Fund, World Bank, and U.S. Treasury Department, which were believed to be necessary for the recovery of countries in Latin America from the economic and financial crises of the 1980s.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nThe consensus as originally stated by Williamson included ten broad sets of relatively specific policy recommendations:<ref name=\"piie.com\"/>\n# [[Fiscal policy]] discipline, with avoidance of large fiscal deficits relative to GDP;\n# Redirection of public spending from subsidies (\"especially indiscriminate subsidies\") toward broad-based provision of key pro-growth, pro-poor services like primary education, [[primary health care]] and infrastructure investment;\n# [[Tax reform]], broadening the tax base and adopting moderate marginal tax rates;\n# [[Interest rate]]s that are market determined and positive (but moderate) in real terms;\n# Competitive [[exchange rate]]s;\n# [[Trade liberalization]]: liberalization of imports, with particular emphasis on elimination of quantitative restrictions (licensing, etc.); any trade protection to be provided by low and relatively uniform [[tariff]]s;\n# Liberalization of inward [[foreign direct investment]];\n# [[Privatization]] of [[State-owned enterprise|state enterprise]]s;\n# [[Deregulation]]: abolition of regulations that impede market entry or restrict competition, except for those justified on safety, environmental and consumer protection grounds, and prudential oversight of [[financial institution]]s;\n# Legal security for [[property right]]s.\n\n===Origins of policy agenda===\nAlthough Williamson's label of the ''Washington'' Consensus draws attention to the role of the Washington-based agencies in promoting the above agenda, a number of authors have stressed that Latin American policy-makers arrived at their own packages of policy reforms primarily based on their own analysis of their countries' situations.

He argues that one of the least controversial prescriptions, the redirection of spending to infrastructure, health care, and education, has often been neglected. He also argues that, while the prescriptions were focused on reducing certain functions of government (e.g., as an owner of productive enterprises), they would also strengthen government's ability to undertake other actions such as supporting education and health. Williamson says that he does not endorse market fundamentalism, and believes that the Consensus prescriptions, if implemented correctly, would benefit the poor.<ref name=Williamson2000 /> In a book edited with Pedro-Pablo Kuczynski in 2003, Williamson laid out an expanded reform agenda, emphasizing crisis-proofing of economies, \"second-generation\" reforms, and policies addressing inequality and social issues (Kuczynski and Williamson, 2003).{{Full citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nAs noted, in spite of Williamson's reservations, the term Washington Consensus has been used more broadly to describe the general shift towards free market policies that followed the [[Post-war displacement of Keynesianism|displacement of Keynesianism]] in the 1970s.

He attributes this limited impact to three factors: (a) the Consensus ''per se'' placed no special emphasis on mechanisms for avoiding economic crises, which have proved very damaging; (b) the reforms\u2014both those listed in his article and, ''a fortiori'', those actually implemented\u2014were incomplete; and (c) the reforms cited were insufficiently ambitious with respect to targeting improvements in income distribution, and need to be complemented by stronger efforts in this direction.

The crisis had multiple origins: the drastic rise in the price of imported oil following the emergence of [[OPEC]], mounting levels of external debt, the rise in US (and hence international) interest rates, and\u2014consequent to the foregoing problems\u2014loss of access to additional foreign credit. The import-substitution policies that had been pursued by many developing country governments in Latin America and elsewhere for several decades had left their economies ill-equipped to expand exports at all quickly to pay for the additional cost of imported oil (by contrast, many countries in East Asia, which had followed more [[export-oriented industrialization|export-oriented strategies]], found it comparatively easy to expand exports still further, and as such managed to accommodate the external shocks with much less economic and social disruption). Unable either to expand external borrowing further or to ramp up export earnings easily, many Latin American countries faced no obvious sustainable alternatives to reducing overall domestic demand via greater fiscal discipline, while in parallel adopting policies to reduce protectionism and increase their economies' export orientation.<ref>See e.g., Patrice Franko, \"The Puzzle of Latin American Development\" (3rd edition, 2007), or Michael Read, \"Forgotten Continent\" (2007).</ref>\n\n==Trade liberalization==\nThe Washington Consensus, as framed by Williamson, envisaged a largely ''unilateral'' process of trade reform, by which countries would lower their non-tariff (especially) and tariff barriers to imports. Many countries, including the majority of those in Latin America, have indeed undertaken significant unilateral trade liberalization over subsequent years, opening their economies to greater import competition while simultaneously increasing the share of exports in their GDP (in parallel, Latin America's share in global trade has also increased).{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nA separate agenda\u2014only tangentially related to the Washington Consensus as framed by Williamson\u2014concerns various programs for ''multilateral'' trade liberalization, whether at the global (WTO) or regional level, including the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) and [[DR-CAFTA]] agreements.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n==Criticism==\nMost criticism has been focused on trade liberalization and the elimination of subsidies, and criticism has been particularly strident in the agriculture sector. In nations with substantial natural resources, though, criticism has tended to focus on privatization of industries exploiting these resources.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nAs of the 2000s, several Latin American countries were led by socialist or other left wing governments, some of which\u2014including Argentina and Venezuela\u2014have campaigned for (and to some degree adopted) policies contrary to the Washington Consensus policies. Other Latin American countries with governments of the left, including Brazil, Chile and Peru, in practice adopted the bulk of the policies included in Williamson's list, even though they criticized the market fundamentalism that these are often associated with. Also critical of the policies as actually promoted by the IMF have been some US economists, such as [[Joseph Stiglitz]] and [[Dani Rodrik]], who have challenged what are sometimes described as the 'fundamentalist' policies of the IMF and the [[US Treasury]] for what Stiglitz calls a 'one size fits all' treatment of individual economies.

Kuntz asserts in his research about the health care system of Yugoslavia before and after the war that the economic pressure Yugoslavs faced as a result of the high-interest, short-term commercial loans the government took under great internal , and external, pressure for liberalization helped to fuel the discontent within the ethnic groups throughout the republic.<ref>{{Cite journal |pmc = 1448556|year = 2004|last1 = Kunitz|first1 = S.

This helped ignite the push for independence for both republics in the coming years. These nations leaving the Yugoslavian SFR blew a catastrophic blow to the GDP of the remaining republics. This new economic reality was one of total desperation and in its wake arose fierce nationalism in the ethnic groups of Yugoslavia. Most notably, it saw the rise of radical, racist Serb leaders into the Bosnian government.\n\nThese leaders shared the desire to create a greater Serbia via the ethnic cleansing of the Croats, Slovenes, and Bosniaks who lived throughout the republic. Extremist Bosnia-Serbs began using the turmoil and economic hardship to encourage hatred and violence against non-Serb ethnicities. This would culminate in the first European genocide since the Holocaust as radical Bosnian-Serbs leaders in both civilian and military roles used centuries-old prejudices against Bosniak Muslims to justify a series of large-scale massacres to remove the Bosniak communities.  \n\nKuntz identifies that there is a link between Western economic policies and a noticeable increase in the ethnic tensions that would engulf the entire country. \n\n===Anti-globalization movement===\nMany critics of [[trade liberalization]], such as [[Noam Chomsky]], [[Tariq Ali]], [[Susan George (political scientist)|Susan George]], and [[Naomi Klein]], see the Washington Consensus as a way to open the [[labor market]] of underdeveloped economies to exploitation by companies from more developed economies. The prescribed reductions in tariffs and other [[trade barrier]]s allow the free movement of goods across borders according to [[market forces]], but labor is not permitted to move freely due to the requirements of a [[Visa (document)|visa]] or a work permit. This creates an economic climate where goods are manufactured using cheap labor in underdeveloped economies and then exported to rich First World economies for sale at what the critics argue are huge markups, with the balance of the markup said to accrue to large multinational corporations. The criticism is that workers in the [[Third World]] economy nevertheless remain poor, as any pay raises they may have received over what they made before trade liberalization are said to be offset by inflation, whereas workers in the First World country become unemployed, while the wealthy owners of the multinational grow even more wealthy.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Profit over people : neoliberalism and global order|last=Noam.|first=Chomsky|date=1999|publisher=Seven Stories Press|isbn=9781888363821|oclc=39505718}}</ref>\n\n[[Anti-globalization movement|Anti-globalism]] critics further claim that First World countries impose what the critics describe as the consensus's neoliberal policies on economically vulnerable countries through organizations such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund and by political pressure and bribery. They argue that the Washington Consensus has not, in fact, led to any great economic boom in Latin America, but rather to severe economic crises and the accumulation of crippling [[external debt]]s that render the target country beholden to the First World.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nMany of the policy prescriptions (e.g., the privatization of state industries, tax reform, and deregulation) are criticized as mechanisms for ensuring the development of a small, wealthy, indigenous elite in the Third World who will rise to political power and also have a vested interest in maintaining the local status quo of labor exploitation.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nSome specific factual premises of the critique as phrased above (especially on the macroeconomic side) are not accepted by defenders, or indeed all critics, of the Washington Consensus. To take a few examples,<ref>\"Statistical Yearbook for Latin America and the Caribbean\" (annual). UN Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean.</ref> inflation in many developing countries is now at its lowest levels for many decades (low single figures for very much of Latin America). Workers in some factories created by foreign investment are found typically to receive higher wages and better working conditions than exist in many of their own countries' domestically owned workplaces. Economic growth in much of Latin America in the last few years has been at historically high rates, and debt levels, relative to the size of these economies, are on average significantly lower than they were several years ago.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\nDespite these macroeconomic advances, poverty and inequality remain at high levels in Latin America. About one of every three people\u2014165&nbsp;million in total\u2014still live on less than $2 a day. Roughly a third of the population has no access to electricity or basic sanitation, and an estimated 10 million children suffer from malnutrition. These problems are not, however, new: Latin America was the most economically unequal region in the world in 1950, and has continued to be so ever since, during periods both of state-directed import-substitution and (subsequently) of market-oriented liberalization.<ref>Michael Read, \"Forgotten Continent\" (2007), page 156.</ref>\n\nSome socialist political leaders in Latin America have been vocal and well-known critics of the Washington Consensus, such as the late Venezuelan President [[Hugo Ch\u00e1vez]], Cuban ex-President [[Fidel Castro]], Bolivian President [[Evo Morales]], and [[Rafael Correa]], President of [[Ecuador]]. In Argentina, too, the recent [[Justicialist Party]] government of [[N\u00e9stor Kirchner]] and [[Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner]] undertook policy measures which represented a repudiation of at least some Consensus policies (see Continuing Controversy below). With the exception of Castro, these leaders have maintained and expanded some successful policies commonly associated with the Washington Consensus, such as macroeconomic stability and property rights protection. But many have also proposed and implemented policies directly opposed to the Washington Consensus: under Chavez, for example, Venezuela partially nationalized the state-run oil company, [[PDVSA|Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela S.A]] (PdVSA), and with the help of the company's assets developed several social programs to help the country's poor. These programs have been credited with the dramatic improvement in quality of life during Chavez's presidency: the poverty rate dropped from 48.6% in 2002 to 29.5% in 2011, while access to education and healthcare was significantly increased.<ref>Charlie Devereux and Raymond Colitt, [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-03-07/venezuelans-quality-of-life-improved-in-un-index-under-chavez.html Venezuelans\u2019 Quality of Life Improved in UN Index Under Chavez.] Bloomberg News May 7, 2013.</ref>\n\nOthers on the Latin American left take a different approach.  Governments led by the Socialist Party of [[Chile]], by [[Alan Garc\u00eda]] in Peru, by [[Tabar\u00e9 V\u00e1zquez]] in Uruguay, and by [[Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva]] in Brazil, have in practice maintained a high degree of continuity with the economic policies described under the Washington Consensus (debt-paying, protection to foreign investment, financial reforms, etc.). But governments of this type have simultaneously sought to supplement these policies by measures directly targeted at improving productivity and helping the poor, such as education reforms and subsidies to poor families conditioned on their children staying in school.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n===Neo-Keynesian criticisms===\n[[Neo-Keynesian economics|Neo-Keynesian]] and [[Post-Keynesian economics|post-Keynesian]] critics of the Consensus{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} have argued that the underlying policies were incorrectly laid down and are too rigid to be able to succeed. For example, flexible [[labor law]]s were supposed to [[job creation|create new jobs]], but economic evidence from Latin America is inconclusive on this point.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} In addition, some argue that the package of policies does not take into account economic and cultural differences between countries.{{by whom|date=July 2015}} Some critics have argued that this set of policies should be implemented, if at all, during a period of rapid economic growth and not\u2014as often is the case\u2014during an [[economic crisis]].{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n[[Mois\u00e9s Na\u00edm]], chief editor of ''[[Foreign Policy]]'', has made the argument that there was no consensus in the first place.

Argentina's former Deputy Foreign Minister [[Jorge Taiana]], in an interview with the state news agency [[T\u00e9lam]] on August 16, 2005, attacked the Washington Consensus.

The country's adoption of an idiosyncratic fixed exchange rate regime (the [[convertibility plan]]), which became increasingly uncompetitive, together with its failure to achieve effective control over its fiscal accounts, both ran counter to central provisions of the Consensus, and paved the way directly for the ultimate macroeconomic collapse.

This definition leaves some room for debate over specific public spending programs. One area of public controversy has focused on the issues of subsidies to farmers for fertilizers and other modern farm inputs: on the one hand, these can be criticized as subsidies, on the other, it may be argued that they generate positive externalities that might justify the subsidy involved.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nSome critics of the Washington Consensus cite Malawi's experience with [[agricultural subsidy|agricultural subsidies]], for example, as exemplifying perceived flaws in the package's prescriptions. For decades, the World Bank and donor nations pressed [[Malawi]], a predominantly rural country in Africa, to cut back or eliminate government fertilizer subsidies to farmers. World Bank experts also urged the country to have Malawi farmers shift to growing cash crops for export and to use foreign exchange earnings to import food.<ref name=\"nytimes.com\">New York Times, 2007 December 2, \"[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/02/world/africa/02malawi.html?em&ex=1196744400&en=8dc6209db5ec0efe&ei=5087%0A Ending Famine, Simply by Ignoring the Experts]\"</ref> For years, Malawi hovered on the brink of famine; after a particularly disastrous corn harvest in 2005, almost five million of its 13 million people needed emergency food aid. Malawi's newly elected president [[Bingu wa Mutharika]] then decided to reverse policy.

They caution, however, that how the subsidy is operated is crucial to its long-term success, and warn against allowing fertilizer distribution to become a monopoly.  Ramachandran and Timmer also stress that African farmers need more than just input subsidies\u2014they need better research to develop new inputs and new seeds, as well as better transport and energy infrastructure. The World Bank reportedly now sometimes supports the temporary use of fertilizer subsidies aimed at the poor and carried out in a way that fosters private markets: \"In Malawi, Bank officials say they generally support Malawi's policy, though they criticize the government for not having a strategy to eventually end the subsidies, question whether its 2007 corn production estimates are inflated and say there is still a lot of room for improvement in how the subsidy is carried out\".<ref name=\"nytimes.com\"/>\n\n==Continuing controversy==\n\nMost Latin American countries continue to struggle with high poverty and [[underemployment]]. Chile has been offered as an example of a Consensus success story, and countries such as [[El Salvador]] and Panama have also shown some positive signs of economic development. Brazil, despite relatively modest rates of aggregate growth, has seen important progress in recent years in the reduction of poverty. This is counterweight, since the last two Brazilian [[Dilma Rousseff|socialist presidents]] have adjusted modest socialist reforms.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nJoseph Stiglitz has argued that the Chilean success story owes a lot to state ownership of key industries, particularly [[Codelco|its]] copper industry, and [[currency intervention]]s stabilizing capital flows. Many other economists, though, argue that Chile's economic success is largely due to its combination of sound macroeconomics and market-oriented policies (though the country's relatively strong public institutions, including one of the better public school systems in the region, also deserve some credit).<ref>See, e.g., Martinez and Diaz, \"Chile: the Great Transformation\" (1995).</ref>\n\nThere have been claims of discrepancies between the Washington Consensus as propounded by Williamson, and the policies actually implemented with the endorsement of the Washington institutions themselves. For example, the Washington Consensus stated a need for investment in education, but the policies of fiscal discipline promoted by the International Monetary Fund have sometimes in practice led countries to cut back public spending on social programs, including such areas as basic education. Those familiar with the work of the IMF respond that, at a certain stage, countries near bankruptcy have to cut back their public spending one way or another to live within their means.<ref>[http://econ161.berkeley.edu/Politics/Fischer_Asia.html Stanley Fischer on the IMF and East Asia<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Washington may argue for enlightened choices among different public spending priorities, but in the last analysis it is domestically elected political leaders who ultimately have to make the tough political choices.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n==Missing elements==\nA significant body of economists and policy-makers argues that what was wrong with the Washington Consensus as originally formulated by Williamson had less to do with what was ''included'' than with what was ''missing''.<ref>See, as examples representative of a much more extensive literature, e.g., Birdsall and de la Torre.

Designed to allow cannons to hit enemy ships at water level, Fort Point is the only one of its kind in the west. It was originally constructed under the leadership of Spanish Lieutenant Jose Joaquin Moraga. Moraga had been sent up from Monterey, about 100 miles south of San Francisco, to build fortifications in the San Francisco Bay in order to secure Spanish control over the whole area. In 1792, he built a Presidio style fort, which had sufficient fortifications, but was clearly not strong enough to truly act as the main defense of the harbor.\n\nIn 1796, Moraga redesigned the fort and gave it the name, Castillo de San Joaqu\u00edn. Unfortunately, the fort was built from adobe brick and constructed on sand, meaning that the adobe cracked when one of the cannons was fired and that each winter the Fort would be heavily damaged from the weather. After the Mexican Revolution in 1821, the Spanish were forced to abandon all of posts in California, including the Castillo. Once the fort was abandoned, the Mexican government attempted to maintain it and others of its kind, but the young government simply did not have the resources to do so. All of the forts in California were abandoned by 1835.\n\nAfter California was granted statehood in 1850, the fort still sat unused until 1856, when the United States government allotted $500,000 (about $14 million in today\u2019s money) to install fortifications in California. The people in charge of the fortifications decided to rebuild The Castillo de San Joaqu\u00edn, but using much more modern materials and building techniques. The fort was built on a granite foundation with masonry walls 12 feet thick. The fort was loaded with weapons and renamed Fort Point. At the time, the fort was incredibly impressive and served as the main fortification protecting the San Francisco bay. It was also the most powerful heavily fortified fort on the west coast when it was built. However, after the civil war, masonry forts of its type were rendered technologically obsolete, leaving Fort Point as simply a testament to San Francisco\u2019s pre-Civil War military might.\n\n== The Golden Gate Bridge ==\n\nThe Golden Gate Bridge is the most instantly recognizable structure in the city of San Francisco. The bridge spans almost two miles across the Golden Gate, the narrow strait where San Francisco Bay opens to meet the Pacific Ocean, connecting the city with Marin County, California.\n\nThe concept of a Golden Gate Bridge started with a journalist named James Wilking. Wilking promoted the idea that a bridge across the Golden Gate would bring many benefits. The idea for this bridge had surfaced forty years earlier, but over time people had lost interest, at least until Wilking revived the idea. In 1919, authorities commissioned Joseph Strauss to conduct a survey of the proposed site for the bridge. The main argument in favor of the bridge\u2019s construction was that it would help encourage development north of San Francisco.\n\nStrauss became fascinated with the bridge, and began drawing up plans and making calculations for the bridge\u2019s construction. After 10 years of planning, the Golden Gate Bridge Company was formed and Strauss was appointed chief engineer for the project. Engineers Charles Ellis and Irving Morrow also joined the project, with Ellis being appointed as the San Francisco representative. These three men can be credited for the design elements featured in the Golden Gate today.\n\nBy 1930, the Golden Gate project had gained sufficient support from the public to ensure passage of a 35 million bond to finance the construction of the bridge. Construction of the bridge started in 1933 and would last until May 27, 1937. It was the longest suspension bridge in the world, and was considered a masterful feat of architectural engineering, designed to hold 5,700 lb/ft on its roadway and 2,000 lb/ft on its walkways.<gallery mode=\"slideshow\">\nFile:Golden Gate 1.jpg|[[Golden Gate Bridge]]\nFile:SanFrancisco1851a.jpg|1851 San Francisco\nFile:SF Chinatown CA.jpg|San Francisco's [[Chinatown, San Francisco|Chinatown]] is the oldest and one of the largest in North America.\nFile:Ambassador.jpg|An example of the architecture closer to downtown.\n</gallery>[[File:Lombardst.jpeg|thumb|upright|left|Cars navigate [[Lombard Street (San Francisco)|Lombard Street]] to descend [[Russian Hill, San Francisco|Russian Hill]].]]\n[[File:Conservatory of Flowers, San Francisco, front, 2007.jpg|thumb|The [[Conservatory of Flowers]] (front entrance) in [[Golden Gate Park]]]]\n[[File:Colin Campbell Cooper - Palace of Fine Arts, San Francisco.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Palace of Fine Arts]] at the 1915 [[Panama-Pacific International Exposition (1915)|Panama-Pacific Exposition]], painted by [[Colin Campbell Cooper]]]]\n\n[[File:Chinatown San Francisco17.jpg|thumb|[[Chinatown]]]]\n\n[[File:Haight Ashbury11.JPG|thumb|left|200px|These Victorian [[rowhouse]]s are in the [[Haight-Ashbury]] neighborhood of San Francisco, California]]\n\n==See also==\n* [[History of San Francisco]]\n* [[Neighborhoods in San Francisco]]\n* [[List of tallest buildings in San Francisco]]\n* [[Painted ladies|Painted Ladies]]\n* [[William Abbenseth]], photographer of San Francisco architecture\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://goldengatebridge.org/research/documents/researchpaper_50th.pdf Golden Gate Bridge] \n* [http://www.greatbuildings.com/places/sf_area.html Great Buildings Online: Architecture of the San Francisco Bay Area]\n* [http://www.sfheritage.org/ San Francisco Architectural Heritage, SF nonprofit]\n* [http://www.friendsof1800.org/LANDMARKS/landmarks.html List of Official SF Landmarks at Friends of 1800 Market website]\n* [http://www.noehill.com/sf/landmarks/default.aspx?content=Local&sequence=name List of SF Landmarks with Photos at NoeHill.com]\n* [http://sfpl4.sfpl.org/librarylocations/sfhistory/sfphoto.htm San Francisco Historical Photograph Collection at SF Main Library] \n* {{HowStuffWorks\n |page   = san-francisco-city-guide4\n |name   = San Francisco Architecture & Landmarks\n |author = [[Amy Westervelt]]\n}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080914220542/http://www.classicsfproperties.com/Architecture/architecture.htm San Francisco Architecture]  Profiles on individuals and firms practicing during the first 100 years of San Francisco's growth.\n* [http://www.sfcityguides.org/descriptions.html  Rising Steel: Two Centuries Of San Francisco Architecture] (From ''San Francisco City Guides: Walking Tour Descriptions'')\n\n{{Architecture of North America}}\n{{Architecture in the United States}}\n\n[[Category:Architecture in California]]\n[[Category:Architecture in the San Francisco Bay Area]]\n[[Category:Culture of San Francisco]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:Queen Anne House.jpg|thumbnail|right|250px|The [[C.
