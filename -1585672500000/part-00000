{"title_page": "Cosine similarity", "text_new": "{{Short description|measure of similarity between vectors of an inner product space}}\n\n'''Cosine similarity''' is a [[measure of similarity]] between two non-zero vectors of an [[inner product space]] that measures the [[cosine]] of the angle between them. The cosine of 0\u00b0 is 1, and it is less than 1 for any angle in the interval {{math|(0, \u03c0]}} [[radian]]s. It is thus a judgment of orientation and not magnitude: two vectors with the same orientation have a cosine similarity of 1, two vectors oriented at 90\u00b0 relative to each other have a similarity of 0, and two vectors diametrically opposed have a similarity of -1, independent of their magnitude. The cosine similarity is particularly used in positive space, where the outcome is neatly bounded in <math>[0,1]</math>. The name derives from the term \"direction cosine\": in this case, [[unit vector]]s are maximally \"similar\" if they're parallel and maximally \"dissimilar\" if they're [[orthogonal]] (perpendicular). This is analogous to the cosine, which is unity (maximum value) when the segments subtend a zero angle and zero (uncorrelated) when the segments are perpendicular.\n\nThese bounds apply for any number of dimensions, and the cosine similarity is most commonly used in high-dimensional positive spaces. For example, in [[information retrieval]] and [[text mining]], each term is notionally assigned a different dimension and a document is characterised by a vector where the value in each dimension corresponds to the number of times the term appears in the document. Cosine similarity then gives a useful measure of how similar two documents are likely to be in terms of their subject matter.<ref>[[Amit Singhal|Singhal, Amit]] (2001). \"[http://singhal.info/ieee2001.pdf Modern Information Retrieval: A Brief Overview]\". ''Bulletin of the IEEE Computer Society Technical Committee on Data Engineering'' 24 (4): 35\u201343.</ref>\n\nThe technique is also used to measure cohesion within clusters in the field of [[data mining]].<ref>P.-N. Tan, M. Steinbach & V. Kumar, ''Introduction to Data Mining'', Addison-Wesley (2005), {{ISBN|0-321-32136-7}}, chapter 8; page 500.</ref>\n\nThe term cosine distance is often used for the complement in positive space, that is: <math>D_C(A,B) = 1 - S_C(A,B),</math> where <math>D_C</math> is the cosine distance and <math>S_C</math> is the cosine similarity. It is important to note, however, that this is not a proper [[distance metric]] as it does not have the [[triangle inequality]] property\u2014or, more formally, the [[Schwarz inequality]]\u2014and it violates the coincidence axiom; to repair the triangle inequality property while maintaining the same ordering, it is necessary to convert to angular distance (see below).\n\nOne advantage of cosine similarity is its [[Computational complexity|low-complexity]], especially for [[Sparse matrix|sparse vectors]]: only the non-zero dimensions need to be considered.\n\nOther names of cosine similarity are ''Orchini'' similarity and the ''Tucker'' coefficient of congruence; ''Ochiai'' similarity (see below) is cosine similarity applied to binary data.\n\n==Definition==\n\nThe cosine of two non-zero vectors can be derived by using the [[Euclidean vector#Dot product|Euclidean dot product]] formula:\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{A}\\cdot\\mathbf{B}\n=\\left\\|\\mathbf{A}\\right\\|\\left\\|\\mathbf{B}\\right\\|\\cos\\theta</math>\n\nGiven two [[Vector (geometric)|vectors]] of attributes, ''A'' and ''B'', the cosine similarity, {{math|cos(\u03b8)}}, is represented using a [[dot product]] and [[Magnitude (mathematics)#Euclidean vector space|magnitude]] as\n\n:<math>\\text{similarity} = \\cos(\\theta) = {\\mathbf{A} \\cdot \\mathbf{B} \\over \\|\\mathbf{A}\\| \\|\\mathbf{B}\\|} = \\frac{ \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n}{A_i  B_i} }{ \\sqrt{\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n}{A_i^2}}  \\sqrt{\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n}{B_i^2}} },</math>\n\nwhere <math>A_i</math> and <math>B_i</math> are [[Euclidean vector#Decomposition|components]] of vector <math>A</math> and <math>B</math> respectively.\n\nThe resulting similarity ranges from &minus;1 meaning exactly opposite, to 1 meaning exactly the same, with 0 indicating [[orthogonality]] or [[decorrelation]], while in-between values indicate intermediate similarity or dissimilarity.\n\nFor [[Approximate string matching|text matching]], the attribute vectors ''A'' and ''B'' are usually the [[tf\u2013idf|term frequency]] vectors of the documents. Cosine similarity can be seen as a method of [[Normalization (statistics)|normalizing]] document length during comparison.\n\nIn the case of [[information retrieval]], the cosine similarity of two documents will range from 0 to 1, since the term frequencies (using [[tf\u2013idf]] weights) cannot be negative. The angle between two term frequency vectors cannot be greater than&nbsp;90\u00b0.\n\nIf the attribute vectors are normalized by subtracting the vector means (e.g., <math>A - \\bar{A}</math>), the measure is called the centered cosine similarity and is equivalent to the [[Pearson correlation coefficient]]. For an example of centering, <math>\\text{if}\\, A = [A_1, A_2]^T, \\text{ then } \\bar{A} = \\left[\\frac{(A_1+A_2)}{2},\\frac{(A_1+A_2)}{2}\\right]^T, \\text{ so } A-\\bar{A}=  \\left[\\frac{(A_1-A_2)}{2},\\frac{(-A_1+A_2)}{2}\\right]^T.</math>\n\n=== Angular distance and similarity ===\n\nThe term \"cosine similarity\" is sometimes used to refer to a different definition of similarity provided below. However the most common use of \"cosine similarity\" is as defined above and the similarity and distance metrics defined below are referred to as \"angular similarity\" and \"angular distance\" respectively. The normalized angle between the vectors is a formal [[distance metric]] and can be calculated from the similarity score defined above {{citation needed|date=December 2015}}. This angular distance metric can then be used to compute a similarity function bounded between 0 and 1, inclusive.\n\nWhen the vector elements may be positive or negative:\n\n:<math>\\text{angular distance} = \\frac{ \\cos^{-1}( \\text{cosine similarity} ) }{ \\pi } </math>\n\n:<math>\\text{angular similarity} = 1 - \\text{angular distance} </math>\n\nOr, if the vector elements are always positive:\n\n:<math>\\text{angular distance} = \\frac{ 2 \\cdot \\cos^{-1}( \\text{cosine similarity} ) }{ \\pi }</math>\n\n:<math>\\text{angular similarity} = 1 - \\text{angular distance}</math>\n\nAlthough the term \"cosine similarity\" has been used for this angular distance, the term is used as the cosine of the angle only as a convenient mechanism for calculating the angle itself and is no part of the meaning. The advantage of the angular similarity coefficient is that, when used as a difference coefficient (by subtracting it from 1) the resulting function is a proper [[distance metric]], which is not the case for the first meaning. However, for most uses this is not an important property. For any use where only the relative ordering of similarity or distance within a set of vectors is important, then which function is used is immaterial as the resulting order will be unaffected by the choice.\n\n=== Confusion with \"Tanimoto\" coefficient ===\n\nThe cosine similarity may be easily confused with the Tanimoto metric, a specialised similarity coefficient with a similar algebraic form:\n\n:<math>T(A,B) = {A \\cdot B \\over \\|A\\|^2 +\\|B\\|^2 - A \\cdot B}</math>\n\nIn fact, this algebraic form [[Jaccard index#Tanimoto Similarity and Distance|was first defined by Tanimoto]] as a mechanism for calculating the [[Jaccard coefficient]] in the case where the sets being compared are represented as [[bit vector]]s.

Features such as words, [[n-grams|''n''-grams]], or syntactic ''n''-grams<ref>{{cite book|last1=Sidorov|first1=Grigori|title=Advances in Computational Intelligence|volume=7630|last2=Velasquez |first2=Francisco|last3= Stamatatos|first3= Efstathios |last4=Gelbukh|first4=Alexander|last5=Chanona-Hern\u00e1ndez|first5=Liliana|publisher=LNAI 7630|isbn=978-3-642-37798-3|pages=1\u201311|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-37798-3_1|series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|year=2013}}</ref> can be quite similar, though formally they are considered as different features in the VSM. For example, words \u201cplay\u201d and \u201cgame\u201d are different words and thus mapped to different points in VSM; yet they are semantically related. In case of ''n''-grams or syntactic ''n''-grams, [[Levenshtein distance]] can be applied (in fact, Levenshtein distance can be applied to words as well).\n\nFor calculating soft cosine, the matrix {{math|'''s'''}} is used to indicate similarity between features. It can be calculated through Levenshtein distance, [[WordNet]] similarity, or other [[similarity measure]]s. Then we just multiply by this matrix.\n\nGiven two {{math|''N''}}-dimension vectors <math>a</math> and <math>b</math>, the soft cosine similarity is calculated as follows:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n    \\operatorname{soft\\_cosine}_1(a,b)=\n    \\frac{\\sum\\nolimits_{i,j}^N s_{ij}a_ib_j}{\\sqrt{\\sum\\nolimits_{i,j}^N s_{ij}a_ia_j}\\sqrt{\\sum\\nolimits_{i,j}^N s_{ij}b_ib_j}},\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nwhere {{math|''s<sub>ij</sub>'' {{=}} similarity(feature<sub>''i''</sub>, feature<sub>''j''</sub>)}}.\n\nIf there is no similarity between features ({{math|''s<sub>ii</sub>'' {{=}} 1}}, {{math|''s<sub>ij</sub>'' {{=}} 0}} for {{math|''i'' \u2260 ''j''}}), the given equation is equivalent to the conventional cosine similarity formula.\n\nThe [[time complexity]] of this measure is quadratic, which makes it applicable to real-world tasks.

The cosine of 0\u00b0 is 1, and it is less than 1 for any angle in the interval {{math|(0, \u03c0]}} [[radian]]s. It is thus a judgment of orientation and not magnitude: two vectors with the same orientation have a cosine similarity of 1, two vectors oriented at 90\u00b0 relative to each other have a similarity of 0, and two vectors diametrically opposed have a similarity of -1, independent of their magnitude. The cosine similarity is particularly used in positive space, where the outcome is neatly bounded in <math>[0,1]</math>. The name derives from the term \"direction cosine\": in this case, [[unit vector]]s are maximally \"similar\" if they're parallel and maximally \"dissimilar\" if they're [[orthogonal]] (perpendicular). This is analogous to the cosine, which is unity (maximum value) when the segments subtend a zero angle and zero (uncorrelated) when the segments are perpendicular.\n\nThese bounds apply for any number of dimensions, and the cosine similarity is most commonly used in high-dimensional positive spaces. For example, in [[information retrieval]] and [[text mining]], each term is notionally assigned a different dimension and a document is characterised by a vector where the value in each dimension corresponds to the number of times the term appears in the document. Cosine similarity then gives a useful measure of how similar two documents are likely to be in terms of their subject matter.<ref>[[Amit Singhal|Singhal, Amit]] (2001). \"[http://singhal.info/ieee2001.pdf Modern Information Retrieval: A Brief Overview]\".

Kumar, ''Introduction to Data Mining'', Addison-Wesley (2005), {{ISBN|0-321-32136-7}}, chapter 8; page 500.</ref>\n\nThe term cosine distance is often used for the complement in positive space, that is: <math>D_C(A,B) = 1 - S_C(A,B),</math> where <math>D_C</math> is the cosine distance and <math>S_C</math> is the cosine similarity. It is important to note, however, that this is not a proper [[distance metric]] as it does not have the [[triangle inequality]] property\u2014or, more formally, the [[Schwarz inequality]]\u2014and it violates the coincidence axiom; to repair the triangle inequality property while maintaining the same ordering, it is necessary to convert to angular distance (see below).\n\nOne advantage of cosine similarity is its [[Computational complexity|low-complexity]], especially for [[Sparse matrix|sparse vectors]]: only the non-zero dimensions need to be considered.\n\nOther names of cosine similarity are ''Orchini'' similarity and the ''Tucker'' coefficient of congruence; ''Ochiai'' similarity (see below) is cosine similarity applied to binary data.\n\n==Definition==\n\nThe cosine of two non-zero vectors can be derived by using the [[Euclidean vector#Dot product|Euclidean dot product]] formula:\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{A}\\cdot\\mathbf{B}\n=\\left\\|\\mathbf{A}\\right\\|\\left\\|\\mathbf{B}\\right\\|\\cos\\theta</math>\n\nGiven two [[Vector (geometric)|vectors]] of attributes, ''A'' and ''B'', the cosine similarity, {{math|cos(\u03b8)}}, is represented using a [[dot product]] and [[Magnitude (mathematics)#Euclidean vector space|magnitude]] as\n\n:<math>\\text{similarity} = \\cos(\\theta) = {\\mathbf{A} \\cdot \\mathbf{B} \\over \\|\\mathbf{A}\\| \\|\\mathbf{B}\\|} = \\frac{ \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n}{A_i  B_i} }{ \\sqrt{\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n}{A_i^2}}  \\sqrt{\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n}{B_i^2}} },</math>\n\nwhere <math>A_i</math> and <math>B_i</math> are [[Euclidean vector#Decomposition|components]] of vector <math>A</math> and <math>B</math> respectively.\n\nThe resulting similarity ranges from &minus;1 meaning exactly opposite, to 1 meaning exactly the same, with 0 indicating [[orthogonality]] or [[decorrelation]], while in-between values indicate intermediate similarity or dissimilarity.\n\nFor [[Approximate string matching|text matching]], the attribute vectors ''A'' and ''B'' are usually the [[tf\u2013idf|term frequency]] vectors of the documents. Cosine similarity can be seen as a method of [[Normalization (statistics)|normalizing]] document length during comparison.\n\nIn the case of [[information retrieval]], the cosine similarity of two documents will range from 0 to 1, since the term frequencies (using [[tf\u2013idf]] weights) cannot be negative. The angle between two term frequency vectors cannot be greater than&nbsp;90\u00b0.\n\nIf the attribute vectors are normalized by subtracting the vector means (e.g., <math>A - \\bar{A}</math>), the measure is called the centered cosine similarity and is equivalent to the [[Pearson correlation coefficient]]. For an example of centering, <math>\\text{if}\\, A = [A_1, A_2]^T, \\text{ then } \\bar{A} = \\left[\\frac{(A_1+A_2)}{2},\\frac{(A_1+A_2)}{2}\\right]^T, \\text{ so } A-\\bar{A}=  \\left[\\frac{(A_1-A_2)}{2},\\frac{(-A_1+A_2)}{2}\\right]^T.</math>\n\n=== Angular distance and similarity ===\n\nThe term \"cosine similarity\" is sometimes used to refer to a different definition of similarity provided below.

Features such as words, [[n-grams|''n''-grams]], or syntactic ''n''-grams<ref>{{cite book|last1=Sidorov|first1=Grigori|title=Advances in Computational Intelligence|volume=7630|last2=Velasquez |first2=Francisco|last3= Stamatatos|first3= Efstathios |last4=Gelbukh|first4=Alexander|last5=Chanona-Hern\u00e1ndez|first5=Liliana|publisher=LNAI 7630|isbn=978-3-642-37798-3|pages=1\u201311|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-37798-3_1|series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|year=2013}}</ref> can be quite similar, though formally they are considered as different features in the VSM. For example, words \u201cplay\u201d and \u201cgame\u201d are different words and thus mapped to different points in VSM; yet they are semantically related. In case of ''n''-grams or syntactic ''n''-grams, [[Levenshtein distance]] can be applied (in fact, Levenshtein distance can be applied to words as well).\n\nFor calculating soft cosine, the matrix {{math|'''s'''}} is used to indicate similarity between features. It can be calculated through Levenshtein distance, [[WordNet]] similarity, or other [[similarity measure]]s. Then we just multiply by this matrix.\n\nGiven two {{math|''N''}}-dimension vectors <math>a</math> and <math>b</math>, the soft cosine similarity is calculated as follows:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n    \\operatorname{soft\\_cosine}_1(a,b)=\n    \\frac{\\sum\\nolimits_{i,j}^N s_{ij}a_ib_j}{\\sqrt{\\sum\\nolimits_{i,j}^N s_{ij}a_ia_j}\\sqrt{\\sum\\nolimits_{i,j}^N s_{ij}b_ib_j}},\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nwhere {{math|''s<sub>ij</sub>'' {{=}} similarity(feature<sub>''i''</sub>, feature<sub>''j''</sub>)}}.\n\nIf there is no similarity between features ({{math|''s<sub>ii</sub>'' {{=}} 1}}, {{math|''s<sub>ij</sub>'' {{=}} 0}} for {{math|''i'' \u2260 ''j''}}), the given equation is equivalent to the conventional cosine similarity formula.\n\nThe [[time complexity]] of this measure is quadratic, which makes it applicable to real-world tasks. Note that the complexity can be reduced to subquadratic.<ref>{{cite conference | last1 = Novotn\u00fd | first1 = V\u00edt | conference = The 27th ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management | date = 2018 | location = Torun, Italy | title = Implementation Notes for the Soft Cosine Measure | arxiv = 1808.09407 | pages = 1639\u20131642 | publisher = Association for Computing Machinery | doi = 10.1145/3269206.3269317 | isbn = 978-1-4503-6014-2 }}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[S\u00f8rensen\u2013Dice coefficient]]\n* [[Hamming distance]]\n* [[Correlation]]\n* [[Jaccard index]]\n* [[SimRank]]\n* [[Information retrieval]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://mathforum.org/kb/message.jspa?messageID=5658016&tstart=0 Weighted cosine measure]\n* [http://blog.christianperone.com/?p=2497 A tutorial on cosine similarity using Python]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cosine Similarity}}\n[[Category:Information retrieval techniques]]\n[[Category:Similarity and distance measures]]\n", "name_user": "Deacon Vorbis", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eProperties:\\top -> \\mathsf{T}", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity"}

The Roman world was largely free from large-scale conflict for more than two centuries, despite continuous wars of imperial expansion on the Empire's frontiers and the year-long civil war known as the \"[[Year of the Four Emperors]]\" over the imperial succession.\n\nAugustus was born '''Gaius Octavius''' into an old and wealthy [[equites|equestrian branch]] of the [[plebs|plebeian]] [[Octavia (gens)|''gens'' Octavia]]. His maternal great-uncle [[Julius Caesar]] was [[assassination of Julius Caesar|assassinated]] in 44 BC, and Octavius was named in Caesar's will as his [[Adoption in ancient Rome|adopted]] son and heir. Along with [[Mark Antony]] and [[Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (triumvir)|Marcus Lepidus]], he formed the [[Second Triumvirate]] to defeat the assassins of Caesar. Following their victory at the [[Battle of Philippi]], the Triumvirate divided the [[Roman Republic]] among themselves and ruled as ''de facto'' [[Roman dictator|dictators]]. The Triumvirate was eventually torn apart by the competing ambitions of its members. Lepidus was driven into exile and stripped of his position, and Antony committed suicide following his defeat at the [[Battle of Actium]] by Octavian in 31 BC.\n\nAfter the demise of the Second Triumvirate, Augustus restored the outward fa\u00e7ade of the free Republic, with governmental power vested in the [[Roman Senate]], the [[Roman magistrate|executive magistrates]], and the [[Roman assemblies|legislative assemblies]]. In reality, however, he retained his autocratic power over the Republic. By law, Augustus held a collection of powers granted to him for life by the Senate, including [[commander-in-chief|supreme military command]], and those of [[tribune]] and [[Roman censor|censor]]. It took several years for Augustus to develop the framework within which a formally republican state could be led under his sole rule. He rejected monarchical titles, and instead called himself ''[[Princeps]] Civitatis'' (\"First Citizen\"). The resulting [[Constitution of the Roman Empire|constitutional framework]] became known as the Principate, the [[History of the Roman Empire|first phase of the Roman Empire]].\n\nAugustus dramatically enlarged the Empire, annexing [[Egypt (Roman province)|Egypt]], [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatia]], [[Pannonia]], [[Noricum]], and [[Raetia]], expanding possessions in [[Africa (Roman province)|Africa]], and completing the conquest of [[Hispania]], but suffered a [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest|major setback]] in [[Germania]]. Beyond the frontiers, he secured the Empire with a buffer region of [[client state]]s and made peace with the [[Parthian Empire]] through diplomacy. He reformed the Roman system of taxation, developed [[Roman roads|networks of roads]] with an [[cursus publicus|official courier system]], established a [[standing army]], established the [[Praetorian Guard]], created official [[cohortes urbanae|police]] and [[vigiles|fire-fighting services]] for Rome, and rebuilt much of the city during his reign. Augustus died in AD 14 at the age of 75, probably from natural causes. However, there were unconfirmed rumors that his wife [[Livia]] poisoned him. He was succeeded as emperor by his adopted son (also stepson and former son-in-law) [[Tiberius]].\n\n== Name ==\nAs a consequence of [[Roman naming conventions|Roman customs]], society, and personal preference, Augustus ({{IPAc-en|\u0254\u02d0|\u02c8|\u0261|\u028c|s|t|\u0259|s|,_|\u0259|\u02c8|-}} {{respell|aw|GUST|\u0259s|,_|\u0259|-}}, {{IPA-la|au\u032f\u02c8\u0261\u028ast\u028as|classical}}) was known by many names throughout his life:\n* '''Gaius Octavius''' ({{IPAc-en|\u0252|k|\u02c8|t|e\u026a|v|i|\u0259|s}} {{respell|ok|TAY|vee|\u0259s}}): He received his [[Given name|birth name]], after his [[Gaius Octavius (praetor 61 BC)|biological father]], in 63 BC. \"[[Gaius (praenomen)|Gaius]]\" was his [[praenomen]], while \"[[Octavia (gens)|Octavius]]\" was his [[Nomen (Roman name)|nomen]].

Mark Antony later used the examples of these battles as a means to belittle Octavian, as both battles were decisively won with the use of Antony's forces. In addition to claiming responsibility for both victories, Antony also branded Octavian as a coward for handing over his direct military control to [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa]] instead.<ref name=\"eck 17 18\">Eck (2003), 17\u201318.</ref>\n\nAfter Philippi, a new territorial arrangement was made among the members of the Second Triumvirate. [[Gaul]] and the province of Hispania were placed in the hands of Octavian. Antony traveled east to Egypt where he allied himself with Queen [[Cleopatra VII of Egypt|Cleopatra VII]], the former lover of Julius Caesar and mother of Caesar's infant son [[Caesarion]]. Lepidus was left with the [[Africa Province|province of Africa]], stymied by Antony, who conceded Hispania to Octavian instead.<ref name=\"eck 18\">Eck (2003), 18.</ref>\n\nOctavian was left to decide where in Italy to settle the tens of thousands of veterans of the Macedonian campaign, whom the triumvirs had promised to discharge. The tens of thousands who had fought on the republican side with Brutus and Cassius could easily ally with a political opponent of Octavian if not appeased, and they also required land.<ref name=\"eck 18\" /> There was no more government-controlled land to allot as settlements for their soldiers, so Octavian had to choose one of two options: alienating many Roman citizens by confiscating their land, or alienating many Roman soldiers who could mount a considerable opposition against him in the Roman heartland. Octavian chose the former.<ref name=\"eck 18 19\">Eck (2003), 18\u201319.</ref> There were as many as eighteen Roman towns affected by the new settlements, with entire populations driven out or at least given partial evictions.<ref name=\"eck 19\">Eck (2003), 19.</ref>\n\n==== Rebellion and marriage alliances ====\n\nThere was widespread dissatisfaction with Octavian over these settlements of his soldiers, and this encouraged many to rally at the side of [[Lucius Antonius (brother of Mark Antony)|Lucius Antonius]], who was brother of Mark Antony and supported by a majority in the Senate. Meanwhile, Octavian asked for a divorce from [[Claudia Pulchra (wife of Augustus)|Clodia Pulchra]], the daughter of [[Fulvia]] (Mark Antony's wife) and her first husband [[Publius Clodius Pulcher]]. He returned Clodia to her mother, claiming that their marriage had never been consummated. Fulvia decided to take action. Together with Lucius Antonius, she raised an army in Italy to fight for Antony's rights against Octavian. Lucius and Fulvia took a political and martial gamble in opposing Octavian, however, since the Roman army still depended on the triumvirs for their salaries. Lucius and his allies ended up in a defensive siege at [[Perusia]] (modern [[Perugia]]), where Octavian [[Perusine War|forced them into surrender]] in early 40&nbsp;BC.<ref name=\"eck 19\" />\n[[File:Domus-augusti-2.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|left|Fresco paintings inside the [[House of Augustus]], his residence during his reign as emperor.]]\n\nLucius and his army were spared, due to his kinship with Antony, the strongman of the East, while Fulvia was exiled to [[Sicyon]].<ref name=\"rowell 32\">Rowell (1962), 32.</ref> Octavian showed no mercy, however, for the mass of allies loyal to Lucius; on 15 March, the anniversary of Julius Caesar's assassination, he had 300 Roman senators and equestrians executed for allying with Lucius.<ref name=\"eck 20\">Eck (2003), 20.</ref> Perusia also was pillaged and burned as a warning for others.<ref name=\"rowell 32\" /> This bloody event sullied Octavian's reputation and was criticized by many, such as Augustan poet [[Sextus Propertius]].<ref name=\"eck 20\" />\n\n[[Sextus Pompeius]], the son of Pompey and still a renegade general following Julius Caesar's victory over his father, had established himself in [[Sicily]] and [[Sardinia]] as part of an agreement reached with the Second Triumvirate in 39&nbsp;BC.<ref>Scullard (1982), 162</ref> Both Antony and Octavian were vying for an alliance with Pompeius. Octavian succeeded in a temporary alliance in 40&nbsp;BC when he married [[Scribonia (wife of Augustus)|Scribonia]], a sister or daughter of Pompeius's father-in-law [[Lucius Scribonius Libo]]. Scribonia gave birth to Octavian's only natural child, [[Julia the Elder|Julia]], the same day that he divorced her to marry [[Livia|Livia Drusilla]], little more than a year after their marriage.<ref name=\"eck 20\" />\n\nWhile in Egypt, Antony had been engaged in an affair with [[Cleopatra VII|Cleopatra]] and had fathered three children with her.{{#tag:ref|These were [[Alexander Helios]], [[Cleopatra Selene II]], and [[Ptolemy Philadelphus (Cleopatra)|Ptolemy Philadelphus]].|group=\"nb\"}} Aware of his deteriorating relationship with Octavian, Antony left Cleopatra; he sailed to Italy in 40&nbsp;BC with a large force to oppose Octavian, laying siege to Brundisium. This new conflict proved untenable for both Octavian and Antony, however. Their centurions, who had become important figures politically, refused to fight due to their Caesarian cause, while the legions under their command followed suit. Meanwhile, in Sicyon, Antony's wife Fulvia died of a sudden illness while Antony was en route to meet her.

As Lepidus and Octavian accepted the surrender of Pompeius's troops, Lepidus attempted to claim Sicily for himself, ordering Octavian to leave.

Augustus prepared to hand down his [[Seal (device)#Signet rings|signet ring]] to his favored general Agrippa. However, Augustus handed over to his co-consul Piso all of his official documents, an account of public finances, and authority over listed troops in the provinces while Augustus's supposedly favored nephew Marcellus came away empty-handed.<ref name=\"ccaa 25\">Eder (2005), 25.</ref><ref name=\"eck 56\">Eck (2003), 56.</ref> This was a surprise to many who believed Augustus would have named an heir to his position as an unofficial emperor.<ref name=\"ccaa 38\">Gruen (2005), 38.</ref>\n\nAugustus bestowed only properties and possessions to his designated heirs, as an obvious system of institutionalized imperial inheritance would have provoked resistance and hostility among the republican-minded Romans fearful of monarchy.<ref name=\"ccaa 38 39\">Gruen (2005), 38\u201339.</ref> With regards to the Principate, it was obvious to Augustus that Marcellus was not ready to take on his position;<ref name=\"Stern, Gaius p. 23\">Stern, Gaius, ''Women, children, and senators on the Ara Pacis Augustae: A study of Augustus's vision of a new world order in 13 BC'', p. 23</ref> nonetheless, by giving his signet ring to Agrippa, Augustus intended to signal to the legions that Agrippa was to be his successor, and that constitutional procedure notwithstanding, they should continue to obey Agrippa.<ref>Holland, pp. 294\u201395; Southern, p. 108</ref>\n\n[[File:Cameo August BM Gem3577.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Blacas Cameo]] showing Augustus wearing a ''[[gorgoneion]]'' on a three layered [[sardonyx]] cameo, AD 20\u201350]]\nSoon after his bout of illness subsided, Augustus gave up his consulship. The only other times Augustus would serve as consul would be in the years 5 and 2&nbsp;BC,<ref name=\"eck 56\" /><ref name=\"ccaa 26\">Eder (2005), 26.</ref> both times to introduce his grandsons into public life.<ref name=\"Davies, p. 259\" /> This was a clever ploy by Augustus; ceasing to serve as one of two annually elected consuls allowed aspiring senators a better chance to attain the consular position, while allowing Augustus to exercise wider patronage within the senatorial class.<ref name=\"ccaa 36\" /> Although Augustus had resigned as consul, he desired to retain his consular ''[[imperium]]'' not just in his provinces but throughout the empire. This desire, as well as the Marcus Primus Affair, led to a second compromise between him and the Senate known as the Second Settlement.<ref name=\"eck 57\">Eck (2003), 57.</ref>\n\n=== Primary reasons for the Second settlement ===\nThe primary reasons for the Second Settlement were as follows. First, after Augustus relinquished the annual consulship, he was no longer in an official position to rule the state, yet his dominant position remained unchanged over his Roman, 'imperial' provinces where he was still a [[proconsul]].<ref name=\"eck 56\" /><ref name=\"ccaa 37\">Gruen (2005), 37.</ref> When he annually held the office of consul, he had the power to intervene with the affairs of the other provincial proconsuls appointed by the Senate throughout the empire, when he deemed necessary.<ref name=\"eck 56 57\">Eck (2003), 56\u201357.</ref>\n\nA second problem later arose showing the need for the Second Settlement in what became known as the \"Marcus Primus Affair\".<ref name=\"Southern p. 109\">Southern, p. 109; Holland, p. 299</ref> In late 24 or early 23&nbsp;BC, charges were brought against Marcus Primus, the former proconsul (governor) of Macedonia, for waging a war without prior approval of the Senate on the [[Odrysian]] kingdom of [[Thrace]], whose king was a Roman ally.<ref>Wells, p. 53</ref> He was defended by [[Lucius Lucinius Varro Murena]], who told the trial that his client had received specific instructions from Augustus, ordering him to attack the client state.<ref name=\"Southern, p. 108\">Southern, p. 108</ref> Later, Primus testified that the orders came from the recently deceased Marcellus.<ref>Holland, p. 300</ref>\n\nSuch orders, had they been given, would have been considered a breach of the Senate's prerogative under the Constitutional settlement of 27 BC and its aftermath\u2014i.e., before Augustus was granted ''imperium proconsulare maius''\u2014as Macedonia was a Senatorial province under the Senate's jurisdiction, not an imperial province under the authority of Augustus. Such an action would have ripped away the veneer of Republican restoration as promoted by Augustus, and exposed his fraud of merely being the first citizen, a first among equals.<ref name=\"Southern, p. 108\" /> Even worse, the involvement of Marcellus provided some measure of proof that Augustus's policy was to have the youth take his place as Princeps, instituting a form of monarchy&nbsp;\u2013 accusations that had already played out.<ref name=\"Stern, Gaius p. 23\" />\n[[File:Augusto come giove, 00-50 dc circa.JPG|thumb|upright|Augustus as [[Jove]], holding a scepter and orb (first half of 1st century AD)]]\n\nThe situation was so serious that Augustus himself appeared at the trial, even though he had not been called as a witness. Under oath, Augustus declared that he gave no such order.<ref>Syme, p. 333</ref> Murena disbelieved Augustus's testimony and resented his attempt to subvert the trial by using his ''[[auctoritas]]''. He rudely demanded to know why Augustus had turned up to a trial to which he had not been called; Augustus replied that he came in the public interest.<ref>Syme, p. 333; Holland, p. 300; Southern, p. 108</ref> Although Primus was found guilty, some jurors voted to acquit, meaning that not everybody believed Augustus's testimony, an insult to the 'August One'.<ref>Wells, p. 53; Raaflaub, p. 426</ref>\n\nThe Second Constitutional Settlement was completed in part to allay confusion and formalize Augustus's legal authority to intervene in Senatorial provinces. The Senate granted Augustus a form of general ''imperium proconsulare'', or proconsular imperium (power) that applied throughout the empire, not solely to his provinces. Moreover, the Senate augmented Augustus's proconsular imperium into ''imperium proconsulare maius'', or proconsular imperium applicable throughout the empire that was more (maius) or greater than that held by the other proconsuls. This in effect gave Augustus constitutional power superior to all other proconsuls in the empire.<ref name=\"eck 57\" /> Augustus stayed in Rome during the renewal process and provided veterans with lavish donations to gain their support, thereby ensuring that his status of proconsular imperium maius was renewed in 13&nbsp;BC.<ref name=\"ccaa 26\" />\n\n=== Additional powers ===\nDuring the second settlement, Augustus was also granted the power of a [[tribune of the plebs|tribune]] (''tribunicia potestas'') for life, though not the official title of tribune.<ref name=\"eck 57\" /> For some years, Augustus had been awarded ''tribunicia sacrosanctitas'', the immunity given to a [[Tribune of the Plebs]]. Now he decided to assume the full powers of the magistracy, renewed annually, in perpetuity. Legally, it was closed to [[Patrician (Ancient Rome)|patricians]], a status that Augustus had acquired some years earlier when adopted by Julius Caesar.<ref name=\"ccaa 36\">Gruen (2005), 36.</ref>\n\nThis power allowed him to convene the Senate and people at will and lay business before them, to veto the actions of either the Assembly or the Senate, to preside over elections, and to speak first at any meeting.<ref name=\"ccaa 26\" /><ref name=\"eck 57 58\">Eck (2003), 57\u201358.</ref> Also included in Augustus's tribunician authority were powers usually reserved for the [[Roman censor]]; these included the right to supervise public morals and scrutinize laws to ensure that they were in the public interest, as well as the ability to hold a [[census]] and determine the membership of the Senate.<ref name=\"eck 59\">Eck (2003), 59.</ref>\n\nWith the powers of a censor, Augustus appealed to virtues of Roman patriotism by banning all attire but the classic toga while entering the Forum.<ref name=\"ccaa 30\">Eder (2005), 30.</ref> There was no precedent within the Roman system for combining the powers of the tribune and the censor into a single position, nor was Augustus ever elected to the office of censor.<ref name=\"bunson 80\">Bunson (1994), 80.</ref> Julius Caesar had been granted similar powers, wherein he was charged with supervising the morals of the state. However, this position did not extend to the censor's ability to hold a census and determine the Senate's roster. The office of the ''tribunus plebis'' began to lose its prestige due to Augustus's amassing of tribunal powers, so he revived its importance by making it a mandatory appointment for any plebeian desiring the [[praetor]]ship.<ref name=\"bunson 427\">Bunson (1994), 427.</ref>\n\n[[File:August Labicana Massimo Inv56230 n2.jpg|thumb|[[Via Labicana Augustus|Head of Augustus]] as [[Pontifex Maximus]], Roman artwork of the late Augustan period, last decade of the 1st century BC]]\nAugustus was granted sole ''imperium'' within the city of Rome itself, in addition to being granted proconsular imperium maius and tribunician authority for life. Traditionally, proconsuls (Roman province governors) lost their proconsular \"imperium\" when they crossed the Pomerium \u2013 the sacred boundary of Rome \u2013 and entered the city. In these situations, Augustus would have power as part of his tribunician authority but his constitutional imperium within the Pomerium would be less than that of a serving consul. That would mean that, when he was in the city, he might not be the constitutional magistrate with the most authority. Thanks to his prestige or ''auctoritas'', his wishes would usually be obeyed, but there might be some difficulty. To fill this power vacuum, the Senate voted that Augustus's imperium proconsulare maius (superior proconsular power) should not lapse when he was inside the city walls. All armed forces in the city had formerly been under the control of the urban praetors and consuls, but this situation now placed them under the sole authority of Augustus.<ref name=\"eck 60\">Eck (2003), 60.</ref>\n\nIn addition, the credit was given to Augustus for each subsequent Roman military victory after this time, because the majority of Rome's armies were stationed in imperial provinces commanded by Augustus through the [[legatus]] who were deputies of the princeps in the provinces. Moreover, if a battle was fought in a Senatorial province, Augustus's proconsular imperium maius allowed him to take command of (or credit for) any major military victory. This meant that Augustus was the only individual able to receive a [[Roman triumph|triumph]], a tradition that began with Romulus, Rome's first King and first triumphant general. [[Lucius Cornelius Balbus the Younger|Lucius Cornelius Balbus]] was the last man outside Augustus's family to receive this award, in 19&nbsp;BC.<ref name=\"eck 61\">Eck (2003), 61.</ref> Tiberius, Augustus's eldest stepson by Livia, was the only other general to receive a triumph\u2014for victories in Germania in 7&nbsp;BC.<ref name=\"eck 117\">Eck (2003), 117.</ref>\n\n=== Conspiracy ===\n[[File:Augustus MAN Napoli Inv6040.jpg|thumb|left|A colossal statue of Augustus from the [[Sodales Augustales|Augusteum]] of [[Herculaneum]], seated and wearing a [[laurel wreath]].]]\nMany of the political subtleties of the Second Settlement seem to have evaded the comprehension of the Plebeian class, who were Augustus's greatest supporters and clientele. This caused them to insist upon Augustus's participation in imperial affairs from time to time. Augustus failed to stand for election as consul in 22&nbsp;BC, and fears arose once again that he was being forced from power by the aristocratic Senate. In 22, 21, and 19&nbsp;BC, the people rioted in response, and only allowed a single consul to be elected for each of those years, ostensibly to leave the other position open for Augustus.<ref>Dio [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/54*.html#1 54.1], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/54*.html#6 6], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/54*.html#10 10].</ref>\n\nLikewise, there was a food shortage in Rome in 22&nbsp;BC which sparked panic, while many urban plebs called for Augustus to take on dictatorial powers to personally oversee the crisis. After a theatrical display of refusal before the Senate, Augustus finally accepted authority over Rome's grain supply \"by virtue of his proconsular ''imperium''\", and ended the crisis almost immediately.<ref name=\"ccaa 26\" /> It was not until AD 8 that a food crisis of this sort prompted Augustus to establish a ''praefectus annonae'', a permanent prefect who was in charge of procuring food supplies for Rome.<ref name=\"eck 78\">Eck (2003), 78.</ref>\n\nThere were some who were concerned by the expansion of powers granted to Augustus by the Second Settlement, and this came to a head with the apparent conspiracy of Fannius Caepio.<ref name=\"Southern p. 109\"/> Some time prior to 1 September 22 BC, a certain Castricius provided Augustus with information about a conspiracy led by Fannius Caepio.<ref>Swan, p. 241; Syme, p. 483</ref> [[Lucius Lucinius Varro Murena|Murena]], the outspoken Consul who defended Primus in the Marcus Primus Affair, was named among the conspirators. The conspirators were tried in absentia with Tiberius acting as prosecutor; the jury found them guilty, but it was not a unanimous verdict.<ref>Wells, p. 53; Holland, p. 301</ref> All the accused were sentenced to death for treason and executed as soon as they were captured\u2014without ever giving testimony in their defence.<ref>Davies, p. 260; Holland, p. 301</ref> Augustus ensured that the facade of Republican government continued with an effective cover-up of the events.<ref>Holland, p. 301</ref>\n\nIn 19&nbsp;BC, the Senate granted Augustus a form of 'general consular imperium', which was probably 'imperium consulare maius', like the proconsular powers that he received in 23 BC. Like his tribune authority, the consular powers were another instance of gaining power from offices that he did not actually hold.<ref name=\"ccaa 43\" /> In addition, Augustus was allowed to wear the consul's insignia in public and before the Senate,<ref name=\"eck 60\" /> as well as to sit in the symbolic chair between the two consuls and hold the [[fasces]], an emblem of consular authority.<ref name=\"ccaa 43\">Gruen (2005), 43.</ref> This seems to have assuaged the populace; regardless of whether or not Augustus was a consul, the importance was that he both appeared as one before the people and could exercise consular power if necessary. On 6 March 12&nbsp;BC, after the death of [[Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (triumvir)|Lepidus]], he additionally took up the position of pontifex maximus, the high priest of the college of the Pontiffs, the most important position in Roman religion.<ref>Bowersock (1990), p. 380. The date is provided by inscribed calendars; see also Augustus, ''[[Res Gestae Divi Augusti|Res Gestae]]'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Augustus/Res_Gestae/2*.html#10 10.2]. Dio [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/54*.html#27.2 27.2] reports this under 13&nbsp;BC, probably as the year in which Lepidus died (Bowersock (1990), p. 383).</ref><ref name=\"ccaa 28\">Eder (2005), 28.</ref> On 5 February 2&nbsp;BC, Augustus was also given the title ''[[pater patriae]]'', or \"father of the country\".<ref>Mackay (2004), 186.</ref><ref name=\"eck 129\">Eck (2003), 129.</ref>\n\n=== Stability and staying power ===\nA final reason for the Second Settlement was to give the Principate constitutional stability and staying power in case something happened to Princeps Augustus. His illness of early 23 BC and the Caepio conspiracy showed that the regime's existence hung by the thin thread of the life of one man, Augustus himself, who suffered from several severe and dangerous illnesses throughout his life.<ref>[[The Twelve Caesars|Suetonius]], ''Augustus'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Augustus*.html#81 81].</ref> If he were to die from natural causes or fall victim to assassination, Rome could be subjected to another round of civil war. The memories of Pharsalus, the Ides of March, the proscriptions, Philippi, and Actium, barely twenty-five years distant, were still vivid in the minds of many citizens. Proconsular imperium was conferred upon [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa|Agrippa]] for five years, similar to Augustus's power, in order to accomplish this constitutional stability. The exact nature of the grant is uncertain but it probably covered Augustus's imperial provinces, east and west, perhaps lacking authority over the provinces of the Senate. That came later, as did the jealously guarded tribunicia potestas.<ref>Syme (1939), 337\u2013338.</ref> Augustus's accumulation of powers were now complete. In fact, he dated his 'reign' from the completion of the Second Settlement, 1 July 23 BC.<ref>Everett (2006), 217.</ref>\n\n== War and expansion ==\n{{Main|Wars of Augustus}}\n{{Further|Roman\u2013Persian relations}}\n[[File:Hermann warrior.jpg|thumb|''The victorious advance of [[Arminius|Hermann]]'', depiction of the 9 AD [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest]], by [[Peter Janssen]], 1873]]\n\nAugustus chose ''Imperator'' (\"victorious commander\") to be his first name, since he wanted to make an emphatically clear connection between himself and the notion of victory, and consequently became known as ''Imperator Caesar Divi Filius Augustus''. By the year 13, Augustus boasted 21 occasions where his troops proclaimed \"imperator\" as his title after a successful battle. Almost the entire fourth chapter in his publicly released memoirs of achievements known as the ''Res Gestae'' was devoted to his military victories and honors.<ref name=\"eck 93\">Eck (2003), 93.</ref>\n\nAugustus also promoted the ideal of a superior Roman civilization with a task of ruling the world (to the extent to which the Romans knew it), a sentiment embodied in words that the contemporary poet [[Virgil]] attributes to a legendary ancestor of Augustus: ''tu regere imperio populos, Romane, memento''\u2014\"Roman, remember by your strength to rule the Earth's peoples!\"<ref name=\"ccaa 30\" /> The impulse for [[expansionism]] was apparently prominent among all classes at Rome, and it is accorded divine sanction by Virgil's Jupiter in Book 1 of the ''[[Aeneid]]'', where Jupiter promises Rome ''imperium sine fine'', \"sovereignty without end\".<ref name=\"eck 95\">Eck (2003), 95.</ref>\n\nBy the end of his reign, the armies of Augustus had conquered northern Hispania (modern Spain and Portugal) and the [[Alps|Alpine]] regions of [[Raetia]] and [[Noricum]] (modern Switzerland, Bavaria, Austria, Slovenia), [[Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum]] and [[Pannonia]] (modern Albania, Croatia, Hungary, Serbia, etc.), and had extended the borders of the [[Africa Province]] to the east and south. [[Iudaea Province|Judea]] was added to the [[Syria (Roman province)|province of Syria]] when Augustus deposed [[Herod Archelaus]], successor to [[client state|client king]] [[Herod the Great]] (73\u20134&nbsp;BC). Syria (like Egypt after Antony) was governed by a high prefect of the equestrian class rather than by a proconsul or legate of Augustus.<ref name=\"eck 94\">Eck (2003), 94.</ref>\n[[File:Tiberius NyCarlsberg01.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Bust of [[Tiberius]], a successful military commander under Augustus before he was designated as his heir and successor]]\n\nAgain, no military effort was needed in 25&nbsp;BC when [[Galatia]] (modern Turkey) was converted to a Roman province shortly after [[Amyntas of Galatia]] was killed by an avenging widow of a slain prince from Homonada.<ref name=\"eck 94\" /> The rebellious tribes of [[Asturias]] and  [[Cantabria]] in modern-day Spain were [[Cantabrian Wars|finally quelled in 19&nbsp;BC]], and the territory fell under the provinces of Hispania and [[Lusitania]].

From the book ''Romanorum Imperatorum effigies'' (1583), preserved in the Municipal Library of Trento (Italy)]]\n\nThe illness of Augustus in 23&nbsp;BC brought the problem of succession to the forefront of political issues and the public. To ensure stability, he needed to designate an heir to his unique position in Roman society and government. This was to be achieved in small, undramatic, and incremental ways that did not stir senatorial fears of monarchy. If someone was to succeed to Augustus's unofficial position of power, he would have to earn it through his own publicly proven merits.<ref name=\"ccaa 50\">Gruen (2005), 50.</ref>\n\nSome Augustan historians argue that indications pointed toward his sister's son [[Marcus Claudius Marcellus (Julio-Claudian dynasty)|Marcellus]], who had been quickly married to Augustus's daughter [[Julia the Elder]].<ref name=\"eck 114 115\">Eck (2003), 114\u2013115.</ref> Other historians dispute this due to Augustus's will being read aloud to the Senate while he was seriously ill in 23&nbsp;BC,<ref name=\"eck 115\">Eck (2003), 115.</ref> instead indicating a preference for Marcus Agrippa, who was Augustus's second in charge and arguably the only one of his associates who could have controlled the legions and held the Empire together.<ref name=\"ccaa 44\" />\n\nAfter the death of Marcellus in 23&nbsp;BC, Augustus married his daughter to Agrippa. This union produced five children, three sons and two daughters: [[Gaius Caesar]], [[Lucius Caesar]], [[Vipsania Julia]], [[Agrippina the Elder]], and [[Agrippa Postumus|Postumus Agrippa]], so named because he was born after Marcus Agrippa died. Shortly after the Second Settlement, Agrippa was granted a five-year term of administering the eastern half of the Empire with the ''imperium'' of a proconsul and the same ''tribunicia potestas'' granted to Augustus (although not trumping Augustus's authority), his seat of governance stationed at [[Samos]] in the eastern [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]].<ref name=\"ccaa 44\">Gruen (2005), 44.</ref><ref name=\"eck 58\">Eck (2003), 58.</ref> This granting of power showed Augustus's favor for Agrippa, but it was also a measure to please members of his Caesarian party by allowing one of their members to share a considerable amount of power with him.<ref name=\"eck 58\" />\n[[File:Augustuksen mauseleomi.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Mausoleum of Augustus]]]]\n\nAugustus's intent became apparent to make Gaius and Lucius Caesar his heirs when he adopted them as his own children.<ref>Syme (1939), 416\u2013417.</ref> He took the consulship in 5 and 2&nbsp;BC so that he could personally usher them into their political careers,<ref>Scullard (1982), 217.</ref> and they were nominated for the consulships of AD 1 and 4.<ref>Syme (1939), 417.</ref> Augustus also showed favor to his stepsons, Livia's children from her first marriage [[Nero Claudius Drusus Germanicus]] (henceforth referred to as Drusus) and [[Tiberius|Tiberius Claudius]] (henceforth Tiberius), granting them military commands and public office, though seeming to favor Drusus. After Agrippa died in 12&nbsp;BC, Tiberius was ordered to divorce his own wife [[Vipsania Agrippina]] and marry Agrippa's widow, Augustus's daughter Julia\u2014as soon as a period of mourning for Agrippa had ended.<ref name=\"eck 116\">Eck (2003), 116.</ref> Drusus's marriage to Augustus's niece [[Antonia Minor|Antonia]] was considered an unbreakable affair, whereas Vipsania was \"only\" the daughter of the late Agrippa from his first marriage.<ref name=\"eck 116\" />\n\nTiberius shared in Augustus's tribune powers as of 6&nbsp;BC, but shortly thereafter went into retirement, reportedly wanting no further role in politics while he exiled himself to [[Rhodes]].<ref name=\"eck 117\" /><ref name=\"ccaa 46\">Gruen (2005), 46.</ref> No specific reason is known for his departure, though it could have been a combination of reasons, including a failing marriage with Julia,<ref name=\"eck 117\" /><ref name=\"ccaa 46\" /> as well as a sense of envy and exclusion over Augustus's apparent favouring of his young grandchildren-turned-sons Gaius and Lucius.

Then applaud as I exit\"\u2014referring to the play-acting and regal authority that he had put on as emperor. Publicly, though, his last words were, \"Behold, I found Rome of clay, and leave her to you of marble.\" An enormous funerary procession of mourners traveled with Augustus's body from Nola to Rome, and on the day of his burial all public and private businesses closed for the day.<ref name=\"eck 123\" /> Tiberius and his son Drusus delivered the eulogy while standing atop two ''[[rostra]]''.

Both his adoptive surname, Caesar, and his title ''Augustus'' became the permanent titles of the rulers of the Roman Empire for fourteen centuries after his death, in use both at [[Rome|Old Rome]] and at [[Constantinople|New Rome]]. In many languages, ''Caesar'' became the word for ''Emperor'', as in the German ''[[Kaiser]]'' and in the Bulgarian and subsequently Russian ''[[Tsar]]'' (sometimes Csar or Czar). The cult of ''Divus Augustus'' continued until the state religion of the Empire was changed to [[Christianity]] in 391 by [[Theodosius I]]. Consequently, there are many excellent statues and busts of the first emperor. He had composed an account of his achievements, the ''[[Res Gestae Divi Augusti]]'', to be inscribed in bronze in front of [[Mausoleum of Augustus|his mausoleum]].<ref>Suetonius, ''Augustus'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Augustus*.html#101.4 101.4].</ref> Copies of the text were inscribed throughout the Empire upon his death.<ref name=\"eck 1 2\">Eck (2003), 1\u20132</ref> The inscriptions in Latin featured translations in Greek beside it, and were inscribed on many public edifices, such as the temple in [[Ankara]] dubbed the ''Monumentum Ancyranum'', called the \"queen of inscriptions\" by historian [[Theodor Mommsen]].<ref name=\"eck 2\">Eck (2003), 2.</ref>\n\nThe ''Res Gestae'' is the only work to have survived from antiquity, though Augustus is also known to have composed poems entitled ''Sicily'', ''Epiphanus'', and ''Ajax'', an autobiography of 13 books, a philosophical treatise, and a written rebuttal to Brutus's ''Eulogy of Cato''.<ref name=\"bunson 47\">Bunson (1994), 47.</ref> Historians are able to analyze excerpts of letters penned by Augustus, preserved in other works, to others for additional facts or clues about his personal life.<ref name=\"shaw-smith 213\">Shaw-Smith (1971), 213.</ref><ref>Bourne (1918), 53\u201366.</ref>\n\nMany consider Augustus to be Rome's greatest emperor; his policies certainly extended the Empire's life span and initiated the celebrated ''Pax Romana'' or ''Pax Augusta''. The Roman Senate wished subsequent emperors to \"[[Felicior Augusto, melior Traiano|be more fortunate than Augustus and better than Trajan]]\". Augustus was intelligent, decisive, and a shrewd politician, but he was not perhaps as charismatic as Julius Caesar and was influenced on occasion by Livia (sometimes for the worse). Nevertheless, his legacy proved more enduring. The city of Rome was utterly transformed under Augustus, with Rome's first institutionalized [[History of criminal justice|police force]], [[fire fighting]] force, and the establishment of the municipal [[prefect]] as a permanent office. The police force was divided into cohorts of 500 men each, while the units of firemen ranged from 500 to 1,000 men each, with 7 units assigned to 14 divided city sectors.<ref name=\"eck 79\" />\n\nA ''[[praefectus vigilum]]'', or \"Prefect of the Watch\" was put in charge of the [[vigiles]], Rome's fire brigade and police.<ref name=\"bunson 345\">Bunson (1994), 345.</ref> With Rome's civil wars at an end, Augustus was also able to create a [[standing army]] for the Roman Empire, fixed at a size of 28 legions of about 170,000 soldiers.<ref name=\"eck 85 86\">Eck (2003), 85\u201387.</ref> This was supported by numerous [[auxiliaries (Roman military)|auxiliary]] units of 500 non-citizen soldiers each, often recruited from recently conquered areas.<ref name=\"eck 86\">Eck (2003), 86.</ref>\n\nWith his finances securing the maintenance of roads throughout Italy, Augustus also installed an official [[courier]] system of relay stations overseen by a military officer known as the ''praefectus vehiculorum''.<ref name=\"eck 81\" /> Besides the advent of swifter communication among Italian polities, his extensive building of roads throughout Italy also allowed Rome's armies to march swiftly and at an unprecedented pace across the country.<ref name=\"chisholm 122\">Chisholm (1981), 122.</ref> In the year 6 Augustus established the ''[[aerarium militare]]'', donating 170 million sesterces to the new military treasury that provided for both active and retired soldiers.<ref name=\"bunson 6\">Bunson (1994), 6.</ref>\n\nOne of the most enduring institutions of Augustus was the establishment of the Praetorian Guard in 27&nbsp;BC, originally a personal bodyguard unit on the battlefield that evolved into an imperial guard as well as an important political force in Rome.<ref name=\"bunson 341\">Bunson (1994), 341.</ref> They had the power to intimidate the Senate, install new emperors, and depose ones they disliked; the last emperor they served was [[Maxentius]], as it was [[Constantine I]] who disbanded them in the early 4th century and destroyed their barracks, the [[Castra Praetoria]].<ref name=\"bunson 341 342\">Bunson (1994), 341\u2013342.</ref>\n\n[[File:Augustus-in-Kalabsha.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Augustus in an Egyptian-style depiction, a stone carving of the [[New Kalabsha|Kalabsha Temple]] in [[Nubia]]]]\nAlthough the most powerful individual in the Roman Empire, Augustus wished to embody the spirit of Republican virtue and norms. He also wanted to relate to and connect with the concerns of the plebs and lay people. He achieved this through various means of generosity and a cutting back of lavish excess. In the year 29&nbsp;BC, Augustus gave 400 sesterces (equal to 1/10 of a Roman pound of gold) each to 250,000 citizens, 1,000 sesterces each to 120,000 veterans in the colonies, and spent 700 million sesterces in purchasing land for his soldiers to settle upon.<ref name=\"ccaa 23\" /> He also restored 82 different temples to display his care for the [[Roman mythology|Roman pantheon]] of deities.<ref name=\"ccaa 23\">Eder (2005), 23.</ref> In 28&nbsp;BC, he melted down 80 silver statues erected in his likeness and in honor of him, an attempt of his to appear frugal and modest.<ref name=\"ccaa 23\" />\n\n[[File:KujulaKadphisesCoinAugustusImitation.jpg|thumb|left|Coin of [[Kushan]] ruler [[Kujula Kadphises]], in the style of Roman emperor Augustus.

As [[Tacitus]] wrote, the younger generations alive in AD 14 had never known any form of government other than the Principate.<ref>Tacitus, ''[[Annals (Tacitus)|Annals]]'' [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 1#3|I.3]]</ref> Had Augustus died earlier (in 23&nbsp;BC, for instance), matters might have turned out differently. The attrition of the civil wars on the old Republican oligarchy and the longevity of Augustus, therefore, must be seen as major contributing factors in the transformation of the Roman state into a [[de facto]] monarchy in these years. Augustus's own experience, his patience, his tact, and his political acumen also played their parts. He directed the future of the Empire down many lasting paths, from the existence of a standing professional army stationed at or near the frontiers, to the dynastic principle so often employed in the imperial succession, to the embellishment of the capital at the emperor's expense. Augustus's ultimate legacy was the peace and prosperity the Empire enjoyed for the next two centuries under the system he initiated. His memory was enshrined in the political ethos of the Imperial age as a paradigm of the good emperor. Every Emperor of Rome adopted his name, Caesar Augustus, which gradually lost its character as a name and eventually became a title.<ref name=\"eck 124\" /> The Augustan era poets Virgil and Horace praised Augustus as a defender of Rome, an upholder of moral justice, and an individual who bore the brunt of responsibility in maintaining the empire.<ref name=\"kelsall 120\">Kelsall (1976), 120.</ref>\n\nHowever, for his rule of Rome and establishing the principate, Augustus has also been subjected to criticism throughout the ages. The contemporary Roman jurist [[Marcus Antistius Labeo]] (d. AD 10/11), fond of the days of pre-Augustan republican [[liberty]] in which he had been born, openly criticized the Augustan regime. In the beginning of his ''[[Annals (Tacitus)|Annals]]'', the Roman historian [[Tacitus]] (c. 56\u2013c.117) wrote that Augustus had cunningly subverted Republican Rome into a position of slavery. He continued to say that, with Augustus's death and swearing of loyalty to Tiberius, the people of Rome simply traded one slaveholder for another.<ref name=\"starr 5\">Starr (1952), 5.</ref> Tacitus, however, records two contradictory but common views of Augustus:\n\n{{quote|Intelligent people praised or criticized him in varying ways. One opinion was as follows. Filial duty and a national emergency, in which there was no place for law-abiding conduct, had driven him to civil war\u2014and this can neither be initiated nor maintained by decent methods. He had made many concessions to Anthony and to Lepidus for the sake of vengeance on his father's murderers. When Lepidus grew old and lazy, and Anthony's self-indulgence got the better of him, the only possible cure for the distracted country had been government by one man. However, Augustus had put the state in order not by making himself king or dictator, but by creating the Principate. The Empire's frontiers were on the ocean, or distant rivers. Armies, provinces, fleets, the whole system was interrelated. Roman citizens were protected by the law. Provincials were decently treated. Rome itself had been lavishly beautified. Force had been sparingly used\u2014merely to preserve peace for the majority.<ref>Tacitus, The Annals, I 9</ref>}}\n[[File:Augustus Bronze X23322 NAMAthens.jpg|thumb|upright|Fragment of a bronze equestrian statue of Augustus, 1st century AD, [[National Archaeological Museum of Athens]]]]\n[[File:VirgilAeneidVI.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Virgil]] reading the [[Aeneid]] to Augustus and Octavia'', by [[Jean-Joseph Taillasson]], 1787]]\nAccording to the second opposing opinion:\n{{quote|filial duty and national crisis had been merely pretexts.

The story of his career shows that Augustus was indeed ruthless, cruel, and ambitious for himself. This was only in part a personal trait, for upper-class Romans were educated to compete with one another and to excel. However, he combined an overriding concern for his personal interests with a deep-seated patriotism, based on a nostalgia of Rome's antique virtues. In his capacity as ''princeps'', selfishness and selflessness coexisted in his mind. While fighting for dominance, he paid little attention to legality or to the normal civilities of political life. He was devious, untrustworthy, and bloodthirsty. But once he had established his authority, he governed efficiently and justly, generally allowed freedom of speech, and promoted the rule of law. He was immensely hardworking and tried as hard as any [[Democracy in Ancient Rome|democratic]] parliamentarian to treat his senatorial colleagues with respect and sensitivity. He suffered from no delusions of grandeur.<ref>[[Anthony Everitt|Everitt]] (2006), 324\u2013325.</ref>}}\n\nTacitus was of the belief that [[Nerva]] (r. 96\u201398) successfully \"mingled two formerly alien ideas, principate and liberty\".<ref name=\"starr 6\">Starr (1952), 6.</ref> The 3rd-century historian Cassius Dio acknowledged Augustus as a benign, moderate ruler, yet like most other historians after the death of Augustus, Dio viewed Augustus as an [[Autocracy|autocrat]].<ref name=\"starr 5\" /> The poet [[Marcus Annaeus Lucanus]] (AD 39\u201365) was of the opinion that Caesar's victory over Pompey and the fall of [[Cato the Younger]] (95 BC\u201346&nbsp;BC) marked the end of traditional liberty in Rome; historian Chester G.

In his criticism of Augustus, the admiral and historian [[Thomas Gordon (Royal Scots Navy officer)|Thomas Gordon]] (1658\u20131741) compared Augustus to the puritanical tyrant [[Oliver Cromwell]] (1599\u20131658).<ref name=\"kelsall 118\">Kelsall (1976), 118.</ref> Thomas Gordon and the French political philosopher [[Montesquieu]] (1689\u20131755) both remarked that Augustus was a coward in battle.<ref name=\"kelsall 119\">Kelsall (1976), 119.</ref> In his ''Memoirs of the Court of Augustus'', the Scottish scholar [[Thomas Blackwell (scholar)|Thomas Blackwell]] (1701\u20131757) deemed Augustus a [[Machiavelli]]an ruler, \"a bloodthirsty vindicative usurper\", \"wicked and worthless\", \"a mean spirit\", and a \"tyrant\".<ref name=\"kelsall 119\" />\n\n=== Revenue reforms ===\n[[File:AugustusCoinPudukottaiHoardIndia.jpg|thumb|left|Coin of Augustus found at the [[Pudukottai]] hoard, from an [[ancient Tamil country]], [[Pandyan Kingdom]] of present-day [[Tamil Nadu]] in India, a testimony to [[Indo-Roman trade]].

Augustus brought a far greater portion of the Empire's expanded land base under consistent, direct taxation from Rome, instead of exacting varying, intermittent, and somewhat arbitrary tributes from each local province as Augustus's predecessors had done. This reform greatly increased Rome's net revenue from its territorial acquisitions, stabilized its flow, and regularized the financial relationship between Rome and the provinces, rather than provoking fresh resentments with each new arbitrary exaction of tribute.<ref name=\"eck 83 84\">Eck (2003), 83\u201384.</ref>\n\nThe measures of taxation in the reign of Augustus were determined by population census, with fixed quotas for each province. Citizens of Rome and Italy paid indirect taxes, while direct taxes were exacted from the provinces. Indirect taxes included a 4% tax on the price of slaves, a 1% tax on goods sold at auction, and a 5% tax on the inheritance of estates valued at over 100,000 sesterces by persons other than the [[next of kin]].<ref name=\"bunson 404\">Bunson (1994), 404.</ref>\n\n[[File:HymiariteKingdomAugustusImitation1stCenturyCE.jpg|thumb|left|1st century coin of the [[Himyarite]] Kingdom, southern coast of the [[Arabian peninsula]].

Private contractors who collected taxes for the State were the norm in the Republican era. Some of them were powerful enough to influence the number of votes for men running for offices in Rome. These tax farmers called publicans were infamous for their depredations, great private wealth, and the right to tax local areas.<ref name=\"eck 83 84\" />\n\nThe use of Egypt's immense land rents to finance the Empire's operations resulted from Augustus's conquest of Egypt and the shift to a Roman form of government.<ref name=\"bunson 144\">Bunson (1994), 144.</ref> As it was effectively considered Augustus's private property rather than a province of the Empire, it became part of each succeeding emperor's patrimonium.<ref name=\"bunson 144 145\">Bunson (1994), 144\u2013145.</ref> Instead of a legate or proconsul, Augustus installed a prefect from the equestrian class to administer Egypt and maintain its lucrative seaports; this position became the highest political achievement for any equestrian besides becoming [[Praetorian prefect|Prefect of the Praetorian Guard]].<ref name=\"bunson 145\">Bunson (1994), 145.</ref> The highly productive agricultural land of Egypt yielded enormous revenues that were available to Augustus and his successors to pay for public works and military expeditions.<ref name=\"bunson 144\" /> During his reign the [[Venatio|circus games]] resulted in the killing of 3,500 [[North African elephant|elephants]].<ref name=\"Woolf2007\">{{cite book|author=Greg Woolf|title=Ancient civilizations: the illustrated guide to belief, mythology, and art|url=https://books.google.com/?id=94NuSg3tlsgC&dq=ancient+civilizations+the+illustrated+guide+mythology&q=3%2C500+elephants|year=2007|publisher=Barnes & Noble|isbn=978-1-4351-0121-0|page=397}}</ref>\n\n=== Month of August ===\nThe month of August (Latin: ''Augustus'') is named after Augustus; until his time it was called [[Sextilis]] (named so because it had been the sixth month of the original [[Roman calendar]] and the Latin word for six is ''sex'').

Sextilis in fact had 31 days before it was renamed, and it was not chosen for its length (see [[Julian calendar]]). According to a ''senatus consultum'' quoted by [[Macrobius]], Sextilis was renamed to honor Augustus because several of the most significant events in his rise to power, culminating in the fall of Alexandria, fell in that month.<ref>Macrobius, ''Saturnalia'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Macrobius/Saturnalia/1*.html#12.35 1.12.35].</ref>\n\n=== Building projects ===\n{{Main|:Category:Augustan building projects}}\n{{Further|Vitruvius|De architectura}}\n[[File:RomaAraPacisDecorazioneVegetale.jpg|thumb|Close up on the sculpted detail of the [[Ara Pacis]] (Altar of Peace), 13&nbsp;BC to 9 BC]]\n\nOn his deathbed, Augustus boasted \"I found a Rome of bricks; I leave to you one of marble.\" Although there is some truth in the literal meaning of this, Cassius Dio asserts that it was a metaphor for the Empire's strength.<ref name=\"dio 56.30.3\">Dio [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/56*.html#30 56.30.3]</ref> [[Marble]] could be found in buildings of Rome before Augustus, but it was not extensively used as a building material until the reign of Augustus.<ref name=\"bunson 34\" />\n\nAlthough this did not apply to the [[Suburra|Subura]] slums, which were still as rickety and fire-prone as ever, he did leave a mark on the monumental topography of the centre and of the [[Campus Martius]], with the [[Ara Pacis]] (Altar of Peace) and monumental sundial, whose central [[gnomon]] was an [[obelisks of Rome|obelisk]] taken from Egypt.<ref name=\"eck 122\">Eck (2003), 122.</ref> The [[relief]] sculptures decorating the Ara Pacis visually augmented the written record of Augustus's triumphs in the ''Res Gestae''.

This came about because it was overseen by Agrippa when he served as aedile, and was even funded by him afterwards when he was a private citizen paying at his own expense. In that year, Augustus arranged a system where the Senate designated three of its members as prime commissioners in charge of the water supply and to ensure that Rome's aqueducts did not fall into disrepair.<ref name=\"eck 79\">Eck (2003), 79.</ref>\n\nIn the late Augustan era, the commission of five senators called the ''curatores locorum publicorum iudicandorum'' (translated as \"Supervisors of Public Property\") was put in charge of maintaining public buildings and temples of the state cult.<ref name=\"eck 79\" /> Augustus created the senatorial group of the ''curatores viarum'' (translated as \"Supervisors for Roads\") for the upkeep of roads; this senatorial commission worked with local officials and contractors to organize regular repairs.<ref name=\"eck 81\">Eck (2003), 81.</ref>\n\nThe [[Corinthian order]] of architectural style originating from ancient Greece was the dominant architectural style in the age of Augustus and the imperial phase of Rome. Suetonius once commented that Rome was unworthy of its status as an imperial capital, yet Augustus and Agrippa set out to dismantle this sentiment by transforming the appearance of Rome upon the classical Greek model.<ref name=\"bunson 34\">Bunson (1994), 34.</ref>\n\n== Physical appearance and official images ==\n[[File:SFEC BritMus Roman Modification1.jpg|thumb|The [[Mero\u00eb Head]] of Augustus, bronze [[Roman portraiture]] bust from [[Mero\u00eb]], [[Kingdom of Kush]] ([[Nubia]], modern Sudan), 27\u201325 BC]]\nHis biographer Suetonius, writing about a century after Augustus's death, described his appearance as: \"...&nbsp;unusually handsome and exceedingly graceful at all periods of his life, though he cared nothing for personal adornment. He was so far from being particular about the dressing of his hair, that he would have several barbers working in a hurry at the same time, and as for his beard he now had it clipped and now shaved, while at the very same time he would either be reading or writing something&nbsp;... He had clear, bright eyes&nbsp;... His teeth were wide apart, small, and ill-kept; his hair was slightly curly and inclined to golden; his eyebrows met. His ears were of moderate size, and his nose projected a little at the top and then bent ever so slightly inward. His complexion was between dark and fair. He was short of stature, although Julius Marathus, his freedman and keeper of his records, says that he was five feet and nine inches (just under 5 ft. 7 in., or 1.70 meters, in modern height measurements), but this was concealed by the fine proportion and symmetry of his figure, and was noticeable only by comparison with some taller person standing beside him...\",<ref>Suetonius, ''Augustus'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Augustus*.html#79 79], translated by [[John Carew Rolfe|J.

He first appeared on [[Ancient Roman coinage|coins]] at the age of 19, and from about 29 BC \"the explosion in the number of Augustan portraits attests a concerted propaganda campaign aimed at dominating all aspects of civil, religious, economic and military life with Augustus's person.\"<ref>Walker and Burnett, pp. 1, 18, 25 (quoted)</ref> The early images did indeed depict a young man, but although there were gradual changes his images remained youthful until he died in his seventies, by which time they had \"a distanced air of ageless majesty\".<ref>Smith, 186</ref> Among the best known of many surviving portraits are the [[Augustus of Prima Porta]], the image on the Ara Pacis, and the [[Via Labicana Augustus]], which shows him as a priest.

The Roman world was largely free from large-scale conflict for more than two centuries, despite continuous wars of imperial expansion on the Empire's frontiers and the year-long civil war known as the \"[[Year of the Four Emperors]]\" over the imperial succession.\n\nAugustus was born '''Gaius Octavius''' into an old and wealthy [[equites|equestrian branch]] of the [[plebs|plebeian]] [[Octavia (gens)|''gens'' Octavia]]. His maternal great-uncle [[Julius Caesar]] was [[assassination of Julius Caesar|assassinated]] in 44 BC, and Octavius was named in Caesar's will as his [[Adoption in ancient Rome|adopted]] son and heir. Along with [[Mark Antony]] and [[Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (triumvir)|Marcus Lepidus]], he formed the [[Second Triumvirate]] to defeat the assassins of Caesar. Following their victory at the [[Battle of Philippi]], the Triumvirate divided the [[Roman Republic]] among themselves and ruled as ''de facto'' [[Roman dictator|dictators]]. The Triumvirate was eventually torn apart by the competing ambitions of its members. Lepidus was driven into exile and stripped of his position, and Antony committed suicide following his defeat at the [[Battle of Actium]] by Octavian in 31 BC.\n\nAfter the demise of the Second Triumvirate, Augustus restored the outward fa\u00e7ade of the free Republic, with governmental power vested in the [[Roman Senate]], the [[Roman magistrate|executive magistrates]], and the [[Roman assemblies|legislative assemblies]]. In reality, however, he retained his autocratic power over the Republic. By law, Augustus held a collection of powers granted to him for life by the Senate, including [[commander-in-chief|supreme military command]], and those of [[tribune]] and [[Roman censor|censor]]. It took several years for Augustus to develop the framework within which a formally republican state could be led under his sole rule. He rejected monarchical titles, and instead called himself ''[[Princeps]] Civitatis'' (\"First Citizen\"). The resulting [[Constitution of the Roman Empire|constitutional framework]] became known as the Principate, the [[History of the Roman Empire|first phase of the Roman Empire]].\n\nAugustus dramatically enlarged the Empire, annexing [[Egypt (Roman province)|Egypt]], [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatia]], [[Pannonia]], [[Noricum]], and [[Raetia]], expanding possessions in [[Africa (Roman province)|Africa]], and completing the conquest of [[Hispania]], but suffered a [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest|major setback]] in [[Germania]]. Beyond the frontiers, he secured the Empire with a buffer region of [[client state]]s and made peace with the [[Parthian Empire]] through diplomacy. He reformed the Roman system of taxation, developed [[Roman roads|networks of roads]] with an [[cursus publicus|official courier system]], established a [[standing army]], established the [[Praetorian Guard]], created official [[cohortes urbanae|police]] and [[vigiles|fire-fighting services]] for Rome, and rebuilt much of the city during his reign. Augustus died in AD 14 at the age of 75, probably from natural causes. However, there were unconfirmed rumors that his wife [[Livia]] poisoned him. He was succeeded as emperor by his adopted son (also stepson and former son-in-law) [[Tiberius]].\n\n== Name ==\nAs a consequence of [[Roman naming conventions|Roman customs]], society, and personal preference, Augustus ({{IPAc-en|\u0254\u02d0|\u02c8|\u0261|\u028c|s|t|\u0259|s|,_|\u0259|\u02c8|-}} {{respell|aw|GUST|\u0259s|,_|\u0259|-}}, {{IPA-la|au\u032f\u02c8\u0261\u028ast\u028as|classical}}) was known by many names throughout his life:\n* '''Gaius Octavius''' ({{IPAc-en|\u0252|k|\u02c8|t|e\u026a|v|i|\u0259|s}} {{respell|ok|TAY|vee|\u0259s}}): He received his [[Given name|birth name]], after his [[Gaius Octavius (praetor 61 BC)|biological father]], in 63 BC. \"[[Gaius (praenomen)|Gaius]]\" was his [[praenomen]], while \"[[Octavia (gens)|Octavius]]\" was his [[Nomen (Roman name)|nomen]].

Mark Antony later used the examples of these battles as a means to belittle Octavian, as both battles were decisively won with the use of Antony's forces. In addition to claiming responsibility for both victories, Antony also branded Octavian as a coward for handing over his direct military control to [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa]] instead.<ref name=\"eck 17 18\">Eck (2003), 17\u201318.</ref>\n\nAfter Philippi, a new territorial arrangement was made among the members of the Second Triumvirate. [[Gaul]] and the province of Hispania were placed in the hands of Octavian. Antony traveled east to Egypt where he allied himself with Queen [[Cleopatra VII of Egypt|Cleopatra VII]], the former lover of Julius Caesar and mother of Caesar's infant son [[Caesarion]]. Lepidus was left with the [[Africa Province|province of Africa]], stymied by Antony, who conceded Hispania to Octavian instead.<ref name=\"eck 18\">Eck (2003), 18.</ref>\n\nOctavian was left to decide where in Italy to settle the tens of thousands of veterans of the Macedonian campaign, whom the triumvirs had promised to discharge. The tens of thousands who had fought on the republican side with Brutus and Cassius could easily ally with a political opponent of Octavian if not appeased, and they also required land.<ref name=\"eck 18\" /> There was no more government-controlled land to allot as settlements for their soldiers, so Octavian had to choose one of two options: alienating many Roman citizens by confiscating their land, or alienating many Roman soldiers who could mount a considerable opposition against him in the Roman heartland. Octavian chose the former.<ref name=\"eck 18 19\">Eck (2003), 18\u201319.</ref> There were as many as eighteen Roman towns affected by the new settlements, with entire populations driven out or at least given partial evictions.<ref name=\"eck 19\">Eck (2003), 19.</ref>\n\n==== Rebellion and marriage alliances ====\n\nThere was widespread dissatisfaction with Octavian over these settlements of his soldiers, and this encouraged many to rally at the side of [[Lucius Antonius (brother of Mark Antony)|Lucius Antonius]], who was brother of Mark Antony and supported by a majority in the Senate. Meanwhile, Octavian asked for a divorce from [[Claudia Pulchra (wife of Augustus)|Clodia Pulchra]], the daughter of [[Fulvia]] (Mark Antony's wife) and her first husband [[Publius Clodius Pulcher]]. He returned Clodia to her mother, claiming that their marriage had never been consummated. Fulvia decided to take action. Together with Lucius Antonius, she raised an army in Italy to fight for Antony's rights against Octavian. Lucius and Fulvia took a political and martial gamble in opposing Octavian, however, since the Roman army still depended on the triumvirs for their salaries. Lucius and his allies ended up in a defensive siege at [[Perusia]] (modern [[Perugia]]), where Octavian [[Perusine War|forced them into surrender]] in early 40&nbsp;BC.<ref name=\"eck 19\" />\n[[File:Domus-augusti-2.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|left|Fresco paintings inside the [[House of Augustus]], his residence during his reign as emperor.]]\n\nLucius and his army were spared, due to his kinship with Antony, the strongman of the East, while Fulvia was exiled to [[Sicyon]].<ref name=\"rowell 32\">Rowell (1962), 32.</ref> Octavian showed no mercy, however, for the mass of allies loyal to Lucius; on 15 March, the anniversary of Julius Caesar's assassination, he had 300 Roman senators and equestrians executed for allying with Lucius.<ref name=\"eck 20\">Eck (2003), 20.</ref> Perusia also was pillaged and burned as a warning for others.<ref name=\"rowell 32\" /> This bloody event sullied Octavian's reputation and was criticized by many, such as Augustan poet [[Sextus Propertius]].<ref name=\"eck 20\" />\n\n[[Sextus Pompeius]], the son of Pompey and still a renegade general following Julius Caesar's victory over his father, had established himself in [[Sicily]] and [[Sardinia]] as part of an agreement reached with the Second Triumvirate in 39&nbsp;BC.<ref>Scullard (1982), 162</ref> Both Antony and Octavian were vying for an alliance with Pompeius. Octavian succeeded in a temporary alliance in 40&nbsp;BC when he married [[Scribonia (wife of Augustus)|Scribonia]], a sister or daughter of Pompeius's father-in-law [[Lucius Scribonius Libo]]. Scribonia gave birth to Octavian's only natural child, [[Julia the Elder|Julia]], the same day that he divorced her to marry [[Livia|Livia Drusilla]], little more than a year after their marriage.<ref name=\"eck 20\" />\n\nWhile in Egypt, Antony had been engaged in an affair with [[Cleopatra VII|Cleopatra]] and had fathered three children with her.{{#tag:ref|These were [[Alexander Helios]], [[Cleopatra Selene II]], and [[Ptolemy Philadelphus (Cleopatra)|Ptolemy Philadelphus]].|group=\"nb\"}} Aware of his deteriorating relationship with Octavian, Antony left Cleopatra; he sailed to Italy in 40&nbsp;BC with a large force to oppose Octavian, laying siege to Brundisium. This new conflict proved untenable for both Octavian and Antony, however. Their centurions, who had become important figures politically, refused to fight due to their Caesarian cause, while the legions under their command followed suit. Meanwhile, in Sicyon, Antony's wife Fulvia died of a sudden illness while Antony was en route to meet her.

The [[Italian Peninsula]] was left open to all for the recruitment of soldiers, but in reality, this provision was useless for Antony in the East.

At the same time, Octavian could not simply give up his authority without risking further civil wars among the Roman generals and, even if he desired no position of authority whatsoever, his position demanded that he look to the well-being of the city of Rome and the [[Roman province]]s. Octavian's aims from this point forward were to return Rome to a state of stability, traditional legality, and civility by lifting the overt political pressure imposed on the courts of law and ensuring free elections\u2014in name at least.<ref name=\"eck 44 45\">Eck (2003), 44\u201345.</ref>\n\n=== First settlement ===\n{{Main|Constitution of the Roman Empire|History of the Constitution of the Roman Empire}}\n\nIn 27 BC, Octavian made a show of returning full power to the Roman Senate and relinquishing his control of the Roman provinces and their armies. Under his consulship, however, the Senate had little power in initiating legislation by introducing [[Bill (proposed law)|bills]] for senatorial debate. Octavian was no longer in direct control of the provinces and their armies, but he retained the loyalty of active duty soldiers and veterans alike. The careers of many clients and adherents depended on his [[patronage]], as his financial power was unrivaled in the Roman Republic.<ref name=\"eck 45\">Eck (2003), 45.</ref> Historian [[Werner Eck]] states:\n\n{{bquote|The sum of his power derived first of all from various powers of office delegated to him by the Senate and people, secondly from his immense private fortune, and thirdly from numerous patron-client relationships he established with individuals and groups throughout the Empire.

He failed to encourage enough senators to finance the building and maintenance of networks of roads in Italy in 20 BC, but he undertook direct responsibility for them.

Scullard, however, Octavian's power was based on the exercise of \"a predominant military power and&nbsp;... the ultimate sanction of his authority was force, however much the fact was disguised.\"<ref name = \"Scullard_p211\">Scullard (1982), 211.</ref> The Senate proposed to Octavian, the victor of Rome's civil wars, that he once again assume command of the provinces. The Senate's proposal was a ratification of Octavian's extra-constitutional power. Through the Senate, Octavian was able to continue the appearance of a still-functional [[constitution of the Roman Republic|constitution]]. Feigning reluctance, he accepted a ten-year responsibility of overseeing provinces that were considered chaotic.<ref name=\"eck 46\">Eck (2003), 46.</ref><ref>Scullard (1982), 210.</ref>\n\nThe provinces ceded to Augustus for that ten-year period comprised much of the conquered Roman world, including all of Hispania and Gaul, [[Syria (Roman province)|Syria]], [[Cilicia]], [[Cyprus]], and [[\u00c6gyptus|Egypt]].<ref name=\"eck 46\" /><ref name=\"ccaa 34\">Gruen (2005), 34.</ref> Moreover, command of these provinces provided Octavian with control over the majority of Rome's legions.<ref name=\"ccaa 34\" /><ref name=\"eck 47\">Eck (2003), 47.</ref>\n\nWhile Octavian acted as consul in Rome, he dispatched senators to the provinces under his command as his representatives to manage provincial affairs and ensure that his orders were carried out.

With this title, he boasted his familial link to deified Julius Caesar, and the use of ''[[Imperator]]'' signified a permanent link to the Roman tradition of victory.

Augustus prepared to hand down his [[Seal (device)#Signet rings|signet ring]] to his favored general Agrippa. However, Augustus handed over to his co-consul Piso all of his official documents, an account of public finances, and authority over listed troops in the provinces while Augustus's supposedly favored nephew Marcellus came away empty-handed.<ref name=\"ccaa 25\">Eder (2005), 25.</ref><ref name=\"eck 56\">Eck (2003), 56.</ref> This was a surprise to many who believed Augustus would have named an heir to his position as an unofficial emperor.<ref name=\"ccaa 38\">Gruen (2005), 38.</ref>\n\nAugustus bestowed only properties and possessions to his designated heirs, as an obvious system of institutionalized imperial inheritance would have provoked resistance and hostility among the republican-minded Romans fearful of monarchy.<ref name=\"ccaa 38 39\">Gruen (2005), 38\u201339.</ref> With regards to the Principate, it was obvious to Augustus that Marcellus was not ready to take on his position;<ref name=\"Stern, Gaius p. 23\">Stern, Gaius, ''Women, children, and senators on the Ara Pacis Augustae: A study of Augustus's vision of a new world order in 13 BC'', p. 23</ref> nonetheless, by giving his signet ring to Agrippa, Augustus intended to signal to the legions that Agrippa was to be his successor, and that constitutional procedure notwithstanding, they should continue to obey Agrippa.<ref>Holland, pp. 294\u201395; Southern, p. 108</ref>\n\n[[File:Cameo August BM Gem3577.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Blacas Cameo]] showing Augustus wearing a ''[[gorgoneion]]'' on a three layered [[sardonyx]] cameo, AD 20\u201350]]\nSoon after his bout of illness subsided, Augustus gave up his consulship. The only other times Augustus would serve as consul would be in the years 5 and 2&nbsp;BC,<ref name=\"eck 56\" /><ref name=\"ccaa 26\">Eder (2005), 26.</ref> both times to introduce his grandsons into public life.<ref name=\"Davies, p. 259\" /> This was a clever ploy by Augustus; ceasing to serve as one of two annually elected consuls allowed aspiring senators a better chance to attain the consular position, while allowing Augustus to exercise wider patronage within the senatorial class.<ref name=\"ccaa 36\" /> Although Augustus had resigned as consul, he desired to retain his consular ''[[imperium]]'' not just in his provinces but throughout the empire. This desire, as well as the Marcus Primus Affair, led to a second compromise between him and the Senate known as the Second Settlement.<ref name=\"eck 57\">Eck (2003), 57.</ref>\n\n=== Primary reasons for the Second settlement ===\nThe primary reasons for the Second Settlement were as follows. First, after Augustus relinquished the annual consulship, he was no longer in an official position to rule the state, yet his dominant position remained unchanged over his Roman, 'imperial' provinces where he was still a [[proconsul]].<ref name=\"eck 56\" /><ref name=\"ccaa 37\">Gruen (2005), 37.</ref> When he annually held the office of consul, he had the power to intervene with the affairs of the other provincial proconsuls appointed by the Senate throughout the empire, when he deemed necessary.<ref name=\"eck 56 57\">Eck (2003), 56\u201357.</ref>\n\nA second problem later arose showing the need for the Second Settlement in what became known as the \"Marcus Primus Affair\".<ref name=\"Southern p. 109\">Southern, p. 109; Holland, p. 299</ref> In late 24 or early 23&nbsp;BC, charges were brought against Marcus Primus, the former proconsul (governor) of Macedonia, for waging a war without prior approval of the Senate on the [[Odrysian]] kingdom of [[Thrace]], whose king was a Roman ally.<ref>Wells, p. 53</ref> He was defended by [[Lucius Lucinius Varro Murena]], who told the trial that his client had received specific instructions from Augustus, ordering him to attack the client state.<ref name=\"Southern, p. 108\">Southern, p. 108</ref> Later, Primus testified that the orders came from the recently deceased Marcellus.<ref>Holland, p. 300</ref>\n\nSuch orders, had they been given, would have been considered a breach of the Senate's prerogative under the Constitutional settlement of 27 BC and its aftermath\u2014i.e., before Augustus was granted ''imperium proconsulare maius''\u2014as Macedonia was a Senatorial province under the Senate's jurisdiction, not an imperial province under the authority of Augustus. Such an action would have ripped away the veneer of Republican restoration as promoted by Augustus, and exposed his fraud of merely being the first citizen, a first among equals.<ref name=\"Southern, p. 108\" /> Even worse, the involvement of Marcellus provided some measure of proof that Augustus's policy was to have the youth take his place as Princeps, instituting a form of monarchy&nbsp;\u2013 accusations that had already played out.<ref name=\"Stern, Gaius p. 23\" />\n[[File:Augusto come giove, 00-50 dc circa.JPG|thumb|upright|Augustus as [[Jove]], holding a scepter and orb (first half of 1st century AD)]]\n\nThe situation was so serious that Augustus himself appeared at the trial, even though he had not been called as a witness. Under oath, Augustus declared that he gave no such order.<ref>Syme, p. 333</ref> Murena disbelieved Augustus's testimony and resented his attempt to subvert the trial by using his ''[[auctoritas]]''. He rudely demanded to know why Augustus had turned up to a trial to which he had not been called; Augustus replied that he came in the public interest.<ref>Syme, p. 333; Holland, p. 300; Southern, p. 108</ref> Although Primus was found guilty, some jurors voted to acquit, meaning that not everybody believed Augustus's testimony, an insult to the 'August One'.<ref>Wells, p. 53; Raaflaub, p. 426</ref>\n\nThe Second Constitutional Settlement was completed in part to allay confusion and formalize Augustus's legal authority to intervene in Senatorial provinces. The Senate granted Augustus a form of general ''imperium proconsulare'', or proconsular imperium (power) that applied throughout the empire, not solely to his provinces. Moreover, the Senate augmented Augustus's proconsular imperium into ''imperium proconsulare maius'', or proconsular imperium applicable throughout the empire that was more (maius) or greater than that held by the other proconsuls. This in effect gave Augustus constitutional power superior to all other proconsuls in the empire.<ref name=\"eck 57\" /> Augustus stayed in Rome during the renewal process and provided veterans with lavish donations to gain their support, thereby ensuring that his status of proconsular imperium maius was renewed in 13&nbsp;BC.<ref name=\"ccaa 26\" />\n\n=== Additional powers ===\nDuring the second settlement, Augustus was also granted the power of a [[tribune of the plebs|tribune]] (''tribunicia potestas'') for life, though not the official title of tribune.<ref name=\"eck 57\" /> For some years, Augustus had been awarded ''tribunicia sacrosanctitas'', the immunity given to a [[Tribune of the Plebs]]. Now he decided to assume the full powers of the magistracy, renewed annually, in perpetuity. Legally, it was closed to [[Patrician (Ancient Rome)|patricians]], a status that Augustus had acquired some years earlier when adopted by Julius Caesar.<ref name=\"ccaa 36\">Gruen (2005), 36.</ref>\n\nThis power allowed him to convene the Senate and people at will and lay business before them, to veto the actions of either the Assembly or the Senate, to preside over elections, and to speak first at any meeting.<ref name=\"ccaa 26\" /><ref name=\"eck 57 58\">Eck (2003), 57\u201358.</ref> Also included in Augustus's tribunician authority were powers usually reserved for the [[Roman censor]]; these included the right to supervise public morals and scrutinize laws to ensure that they were in the public interest, as well as the ability to hold a [[census]] and determine the membership of the Senate.<ref name=\"eck 59\">Eck (2003), 59.</ref>\n\nWith the powers of a censor, Augustus appealed to virtues of Roman patriotism by banning all attire but the classic toga while entering the Forum.<ref name=\"ccaa 30\">Eder (2005), 30.</ref> There was no precedent within the Roman system for combining the powers of the tribune and the censor into a single position, nor was Augustus ever elected to the office of censor.<ref name=\"bunson 80\">Bunson (1994), 80.</ref> Julius Caesar had been granted similar powers, wherein he was charged with supervising the morals of the state. However, this position did not extend to the censor's ability to hold a census and determine the Senate's roster. The office of the ''tribunus plebis'' began to lose its prestige due to Augustus's amassing of tribunal powers, so he revived its importance by making it a mandatory appointment for any plebeian desiring the [[praetor]]ship.<ref name=\"bunson 427\">Bunson (1994), 427.</ref>\n\n[[File:August Labicana Massimo Inv56230 n2.jpg|thumb|[[Via Labicana Augustus|Head of Augustus]] as [[Pontifex Maximus]], Roman artwork of the late Augustan period, last decade of the 1st century BC]]\nAugustus was granted sole ''imperium'' within the city of Rome itself, in addition to being granted proconsular imperium maius and tribunician authority for life. Traditionally, proconsuls (Roman province governors) lost their proconsular \"imperium\" when they crossed the Pomerium \u2013 the sacred boundary of Rome \u2013 and entered the city. In these situations, Augustus would have power as part of his tribunician authority but his constitutional imperium within the Pomerium would be less than that of a serving consul. That would mean that, when he was in the city, he might not be the constitutional magistrate with the most authority. Thanks to his prestige or ''auctoritas'', his wishes would usually be obeyed, but there might be some difficulty. To fill this power vacuum, the Senate voted that Augustus's imperium proconsulare maius (superior proconsular power) should not lapse when he was inside the city walls. All armed forces in the city had formerly been under the control of the urban praetors and consuls, but this situation now placed them under the sole authority of Augustus.<ref name=\"eck 60\">Eck (2003), 60.</ref>\n\nIn addition, the credit was given to Augustus for each subsequent Roman military victory after this time, because the majority of Rome's armies were stationed in imperial provinces commanded by Augustus through the [[legatus]] who were deputies of the princeps in the provinces. Moreover, if a battle was fought in a Senatorial province, Augustus's proconsular imperium maius allowed him to take command of (or credit for) any major military victory. This meant that Augustus was the only individual able to receive a [[Roman triumph|triumph]], a tradition that began with Romulus, Rome's first King and first triumphant general. [[Lucius Cornelius Balbus the Younger|Lucius Cornelius Balbus]] was the last man outside Augustus's family to receive this award, in 19&nbsp;BC.<ref name=\"eck 61\">Eck (2003), 61.</ref> Tiberius, Augustus's eldest stepson by Livia, was the only other general to receive a triumph\u2014for victories in Germania in 7&nbsp;BC.<ref name=\"eck 117\">Eck (2003), 117.</ref>\n\n=== Conspiracy ===\n[[File:Augustus MAN Napoli Inv6040.jpg|thumb|left|A colossal statue of Augustus from the [[Sodales Augustales|Augusteum]] of [[Herculaneum]], seated and wearing a [[laurel wreath]].]]\nMany of the political subtleties of the Second Settlement seem to have evaded the comprehension of the Plebeian class, who were Augustus's greatest supporters and clientele. This caused them to insist upon Augustus's participation in imperial affairs from time to time. Augustus failed to stand for election as consul in 22&nbsp;BC, and fears arose once again that he was being forced from power by the aristocratic Senate. In 22, 21, and 19&nbsp;BC, the people rioted in response, and only allowed a single consul to be elected for each of those years, ostensibly to leave the other position open for Augustus.<ref>Dio [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/54*.html#1 54.1], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/54*.html#6 6], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/54*.html#10 10].</ref>\n\nLikewise, there was a food shortage in Rome in 22&nbsp;BC which sparked panic, while many urban plebs called for Augustus to take on dictatorial powers to personally oversee the crisis. After a theatrical display of refusal before the Senate, Augustus finally accepted authority over Rome's grain supply \"by virtue of his proconsular ''imperium''\", and ended the crisis almost immediately.<ref name=\"ccaa 26\" /> It was not until AD 8 that a food crisis of this sort prompted Augustus to establish a ''praefectus annonae'', a permanent prefect who was in charge of procuring food supplies for Rome.<ref name=\"eck 78\">Eck (2003), 78.</ref>\n\nThere were some who were concerned by the expansion of powers granted to Augustus by the Second Settlement, and this came to a head with the apparent conspiracy of Fannius Caepio.<ref name=\"Southern p. 109\"/> Some time prior to 1 September 22 BC, a certain Castricius provided Augustus with information about a conspiracy led by Fannius Caepio.<ref>Swan, p. 241; Syme, p. 483</ref> [[Lucius Lucinius Varro Murena|Murena]], the outspoken Consul who defended Primus in the Marcus Primus Affair, was named among the conspirators.

Like his tribune authority, the consular powers were another instance of gaining power from offices that he did not actually hold.<ref name=\"ccaa 43\" /> In addition, Augustus was allowed to wear the consul's insignia in public and before the Senate,<ref name=\"eck 60\" /> as well as to sit in the symbolic chair between the two consuls and hold the [[fasces]], an emblem of consular authority.<ref name=\"ccaa 43\">Gruen (2005), 43.</ref> This seems to have assuaged the populace; regardless of whether or not Augustus was a consul, the importance was that he both appeared as one before the people and could exercise consular power if necessary.

His illness of early 23 BC and the Caepio conspiracy showed that the regime's existence hung by the thin thread of the life of one man, Augustus himself, who suffered from several severe and dangerous illnesses throughout his life.<ref>[[The Twelve Caesars|Suetonius]], ''Augustus'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Augustus*.html#81 81].</ref> If he were to die from natural causes or fall victim to assassination, Rome could be subjected to another round of civil war. The memories of Pharsalus, the Ides of March, the proscriptions, Philippi, and Actium, barely twenty-five years distant, were still vivid in the minds of many citizens. Proconsular imperium was conferred upon [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa|Agrippa]] for five years, similar to Augustus's power, in order to accomplish this constitutional stability. The exact nature of the grant is uncertain but it probably covered Augustus's imperial provinces, east and west, perhaps lacking authority over the provinces of the Senate. That came later, as did the jealously guarded tribunicia potestas.<ref>Syme (1939), 337\u2013338.</ref> Augustus's accumulation of powers were now complete. In fact, he dated his 'reign' from the completion of the Second Settlement, 1 July 23 BC.<ref>Everett (2006), 217.</ref>\n\n== War and expansion ==\n{{Main|Wars of Augustus}}\n{{Further|Roman\u2013Persian relations}}\n[[File:Hermann warrior.jpg|thumb|''The victorious advance of [[Arminius|Hermann]]'', depiction of the 9 AD [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest]], by [[Peter Janssen]], 1873]]\n\nAugustus chose ''Imperator'' (\"victorious commander\") to be his first name, since he wanted to make an emphatically clear connection between himself and the notion of victory, and consequently became known as ''Imperator Caesar Divi Filius Augustus''. By the year 13, Augustus boasted 21 occasions where his troops proclaimed \"imperator\" as his title after a successful battle. Almost the entire fourth chapter in his publicly released memoirs of achievements known as the ''Res Gestae'' was devoted to his military victories and honors.<ref name=\"eck 93\">Eck (2003), 93.</ref>\n\nAugustus also promoted the ideal of a superior Roman civilization with a task of ruling the world (to the extent to which the Romans knew it), a sentiment embodied in words that the contemporary poet [[Virgil]] attributes to a legendary ancestor of Augustus: ''tu regere imperio populos, Romane, memento''\u2014\"Roman, remember by your strength to rule the Earth's peoples!\"<ref name=\"ccaa 30\" /> The impulse for [[expansionism]] was apparently prominent among all classes at Rome, and it is accorded divine sanction by Virgil's Jupiter in Book 1 of the ''[[Aeneid]]'', where Jupiter promises Rome ''imperium sine fine'', \"sovereignty without end\".<ref name=\"eck 95\">Eck (2003), 95.</ref>\n\nBy the end of his reign, the armies of Augustus had conquered northern Hispania (modern Spain and Portugal) and the [[Alps|Alpine]] regions of [[Raetia]] and [[Noricum]] (modern Switzerland, Bavaria, Austria, Slovenia), [[Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum]] and [[Pannonia]] (modern Albania, Croatia, Hungary, Serbia, etc.), and had extended the borders of the [[Africa Province]] to the east and south. [[Iudaea Province|Judea]] was added to the [[Syria (Roman province)|province of Syria]] when Augustus deposed [[Herod Archelaus]], successor to [[client state|client king]] [[Herod the Great]] (73\u20134&nbsp;BC).

From the book ''Romanorum Imperatorum effigies'' (1583), preserved in the Municipal Library of Trento (Italy)]]\n\nThe illness of Augustus in 23&nbsp;BC brought the problem of succession to the forefront of political issues and the public. To ensure stability, he needed to designate an heir to his unique position in Roman society and government. This was to be achieved in small, undramatic, and incremental ways that did not stir senatorial fears of monarchy. If someone was to succeed to Augustus's unofficial position of power, he would have to earn it through his own publicly proven merits.<ref name=\"ccaa 50\">Gruen (2005), 50.</ref>\n\nSome Augustan historians argue that indications pointed toward his sister's son [[Marcus Claudius Marcellus (Julio-Claudian dynasty)|Marcellus]], who had been quickly married to Augustus's daughter [[Julia the Elder]].<ref name=\"eck 114 115\">Eck (2003), 114\u2013115.</ref> Other historians dispute this due to Augustus's will being read aloud to the Senate while he was seriously ill in 23&nbsp;BC,<ref name=\"eck 115\">Eck (2003), 115.</ref> instead indicating a preference for Marcus Agrippa, who was Augustus's second in charge and arguably the only one of his associates who could have controlled the legions and held the Empire together.<ref name=\"ccaa 44\" />\n\nAfter the death of Marcellus in 23&nbsp;BC, Augustus married his daughter to Agrippa. This union produced five children, three sons and two daughters: [[Gaius Caesar]], [[Lucius Caesar]], [[Vipsania Julia]], [[Agrippina the Elder]], and [[Agrippa Postumus|Postumus Agrippa]], so named because he was born after Marcus Agrippa died. Shortly after the Second Settlement, Agrippa was granted a five-year term of administering the eastern half of the Empire with the ''imperium'' of a proconsul and the same ''tribunicia potestas'' granted to Augustus (although not trumping Augustus's authority), his seat of governance stationed at [[Samos]] in the eastern [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]].<ref name=\"ccaa 44\">Gruen (2005), 44.</ref><ref name=\"eck 58\">Eck (2003), 58.</ref> This granting of power showed Augustus's favor for Agrippa, but it was also a measure to please members of his Caesarian party by allowing one of their members to share a considerable amount of power with him.<ref name=\"eck 58\" />\n[[File:Augustuksen mauseleomi.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Mausoleum of Augustus]]]]\n\nAugustus's intent became apparent to make Gaius and Lucius Caesar his heirs when he adopted them as his own children.<ref>Syme (1939), 416\u2013417.</ref> He took the consulship in 5 and 2&nbsp;BC so that he could personally usher them into their political careers,<ref>Scullard (1982), 217.</ref> and they were nominated for the consulships of AD 1 and 4.<ref>Syme (1939), 417.</ref> Augustus also showed favor to his stepsons, Livia's children from her first marriage [[Nero Claudius Drusus Germanicus]] (henceforth referred to as Drusus) and [[Tiberius|Tiberius Claudius]] (henceforth Tiberius), granting them military commands and public office, though seeming to favor Drusus. After Agrippa died in 12&nbsp;BC, Tiberius was ordered to divorce his own wife [[Vipsania Agrippina]] and marry Agrippa's widow, Augustus's daughter Julia\u2014as soon as a period of mourning for Agrippa had ended.<ref name=\"eck 116\">Eck (2003), 116.</ref> Drusus's marriage to Augustus's niece [[Antonia Minor|Antonia]] was considered an unbreakable affair, whereas Vipsania was \"only\" the daughter of the late Agrippa from his first marriage.<ref name=\"eck 116\" />\n\nTiberius shared in Augustus's tribune powers as of 6&nbsp;BC, but shortly thereafter went into retirement, reportedly wanting no further role in politics while he exiled himself to [[Rhodes]].<ref name=\"eck 117\" /><ref name=\"ccaa 46\">Gruen (2005), 46.</ref> No specific reason is known for his departure, though it could have been a combination of reasons, including a failing marriage with Julia,<ref name=\"eck 117\" /><ref name=\"ccaa 46\" /> as well as a sense of envy and exclusion over Augustus's apparent favouring of his young grandchildren-turned-sons Gaius and Lucius. (Gaius and Lucius joined the college of priests at an early age, were presented to spectators in a more favorable light, and were introduced to the army in Gaul.)<ref name=\"eck 117 118\">Eck (2003), 117\u2013118.</ref><ref name=\"ccaa 46 47\">Gruen (2005), 46\u201347.</ref>\n\nAfter the early deaths of both Lucius and Gaius in AD 2 and 4 respectively, and the earlier death of his brother Drusus (9&nbsp;BC), Tiberius was recalled to Rome in June AD 4, where he was adopted by Augustus on the condition that he, in turn, adopt his nephew [[Germanicus]].<ref name=\"eck 119\">Eck (2003), 119.</ref> This continued the tradition of presenting at least two generations of heirs.<ref name=\"eck 116\" /> In that year, Tiberius was also granted the powers of a tribune and proconsul, emissaries from foreign kings had to pay their respects to him, and by AD 13 was awarded with his second triumph and equal level of ''imperium'' with that of Augustus.<ref name=\"eck 119 120\">Eck (2003), 119\u2013120.</ref>\n[[File:Great Cameo of France CdM Paris Bab264 white background.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|right|The deified Augustus hovers over Tiberius and other Julio-Claudians in the [[Great Cameo of France]]]]\n\nThe only other possible claimant as heir was Postumus Agrippa, who had been exiled by Augustus in AD 7, his banishment made permanent by senatorial decree, and Augustus officially disowned him. He certainly fell out of Augustus's favor as an heir; the historian Erich S. Gruen notes various contemporary sources that state Postumus Agrippa was a \"vulgar young man, brutal and brutish, and of depraved character\".<ref name=\"ccaa 49\">Gruen (2005), 49.</ref>\n\nOn 19 August AD 14, Augustus died while visiting [[Nola]] where his father had died.

Livia had long been the target of similar rumors of poisoning on the behalf of her son, most or all of which are unlikely to have been true.<ref name=\"Everitt\">{{cite book | title=Agustus: The Life of rome's First Emperor| last=Everitt| first=Anthony| date=2006| pages=312\u201320| publisher=Random House| location=New York| isbn=978-0-8129-7058-6}}</ref>\n\nAlternatively, it is possible that Livia did supply a poisoned fig (she did cultivate a variety of fig named for her that Augustus is said to have enjoyed), but did so as a means of assisted suicide rather than murder. Augustus's health had been in decline in the months immediately before his death, and he had made significant preparations for a smooth transition in power, having at last reluctantly settled on Tiberius as his choice of heir.<ref name=\"eck 123\">Eck (2003), 123.</ref> It is likely that Augustus was not expected to return alive from Nola, but it seems that his health improved once there; it has therefore been speculated that Augustus and Livia conspired to end his life at the anticipated time, having committed all political process to accepting Tiberius, in order to not endanger that transition.<ref name=\"Everitt\"/>\n\nAugustus's famous last words were, \"Have I played the part well? Then applaud as I exit\"\u2014referring to the play-acting and regal authority that he had put on as emperor. Publicly, though, his last words were, \"Behold, I found Rome of clay, and leave her to you of marble.\" An enormous funerary procession of mourners traveled with Augustus's body from Nola to Rome, and on the day of his burial all public and private businesses closed for the day.<ref name=\"eck 123\" /> Tiberius and his son Drusus delivered the eulogy while standing atop two ''[[rostra]]''. Augustus's body was coffin-bound and cremated on a pyre close to [[Mausoleum of Augustus|his mausoleum]].

Shotter states that Augustus's policy of favoring the Julian family line over the Claudian might have afforded Tiberius sufficient cause to show open disdain for Augustus after the latter's death; instead, Tiberius was always quick to rebuke those who criticized Augustus.<ref>Shotter (1966), 210\u2013212.</ref> Shotter suggests that Augustus's deification obliged Tiberius to suppress any open resentment that he might have harbored, coupled with Tiberius's \"extremely conservative\" attitude towards religion.<ref name=\"shotter 211\">Shotter (1966), 211.</ref> Also, historian R.

Both his adoptive surname, Caesar, and his title ''Augustus'' became the permanent titles of the rulers of the Roman Empire for fourteen centuries after his death, in use both at [[Rome|Old Rome]] and at [[Constantinople|New Rome]]. In many languages, ''Caesar'' became the word for ''Emperor'', as in the German ''[[Kaiser]]'' and in the Bulgarian and subsequently Russian ''[[Tsar]]'' (sometimes Csar or Czar). The cult of ''Divus Augustus'' continued until the state religion of the Empire was changed to [[Christianity]] in 391 by [[Theodosius I]]. Consequently, there are many excellent statues and busts of the first emperor. He had composed an account of his achievements, the ''[[Res Gestae Divi Augusti]]'', to be inscribed in bronze in front of [[Mausoleum of Augustus|his mausoleum]].<ref>Suetonius, ''Augustus'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Augustus*.html#101.4 101.4].</ref> Copies of the text were inscribed throughout the Empire upon his death.<ref name=\"eck 1 2\">Eck (2003), 1\u20132</ref> The inscriptions in Latin featured translations in Greek beside it, and were inscribed on many public edifices, such as the temple in [[Ankara]] dubbed the ''Monumentum Ancyranum'', called the \"queen of inscriptions\" by historian [[Theodor Mommsen]].<ref name=\"eck 2\">Eck (2003), 2.</ref>\n\nThe ''Res Gestae'' is the only work to have survived from antiquity, though Augustus is also known to have composed poems entitled ''Sicily'', ''Epiphanus'', and ''Ajax'', an autobiography of 13 books, a philosophical treatise, and a written rebuttal to Brutus's ''Eulogy of Cato''.<ref name=\"bunson 47\">Bunson (1994), 47.</ref> Historians are able to analyze excerpts of letters penned by Augustus, preserved in other works, to others for additional facts or clues about his personal life.<ref name=\"shaw-smith 213\">Shaw-Smith (1971), 213.</ref><ref>Bourne (1918), 53\u201366.</ref>\n\nMany consider Augustus to be Rome's greatest emperor; his policies certainly extended the Empire's life span and initiated the celebrated ''Pax Romana'' or ''Pax Augusta''. The Roman Senate wished subsequent emperors to \"[[Felicior Augusto, melior Traiano|be more fortunate than Augustus and better than Trajan]]\". Augustus was intelligent, decisive, and a shrewd politician, but he was not perhaps as charismatic as Julius Caesar and was influenced on occasion by Livia (sometimes for the worse). Nevertheless, his legacy proved more enduring. The city of Rome was utterly transformed under Augustus, with Rome's first institutionalized [[History of criminal justice|police force]], [[fire fighting]] force, and the establishment of the municipal [[prefect]] as a permanent office. The police force was divided into cohorts of 500 men each, while the units of firemen ranged from 500 to 1,000 men each, with 7 units assigned to 14 divided city sectors.<ref name=\"eck 79\" />\n\nA ''[[praefectus vigilum]]'', or \"Prefect of the Watch\" was put in charge of the [[vigiles]], Rome's fire brigade and police.<ref name=\"bunson 345\">Bunson (1994), 345.</ref> With Rome's civil wars at an end, Augustus was also able to create a [[standing army]] for the Roman Empire, fixed at a size of 28 legions of about 170,000 soldiers.<ref name=\"eck 85 86\">Eck (2003), 85\u201387.</ref> This was supported by numerous [[auxiliaries (Roman military)|auxiliary]] units of 500 non-citizen soldiers each, often recruited from recently conquered areas.<ref name=\"eck 86\">Eck (2003), 86.</ref>\n\nWith his finances securing the maintenance of roads throughout Italy, Augustus also installed an official [[courier]] system of relay stations overseen by a military officer known as the ''praefectus vehiculorum''.<ref name=\"eck 81\" /> Besides the advent of swifter communication among Italian polities, his extensive building of roads throughout Italy also allowed Rome's armies to march swiftly and at an unprecedented pace across the country.<ref name=\"chisholm 122\">Chisholm (1981), 122.</ref> In the year 6 Augustus established the ''[[aerarium militare]]'', donating 170 million sesterces to the new military treasury that provided for both active and retired soldiers.<ref name=\"bunson 6\">Bunson (1994), 6.</ref>\n\nOne of the most enduring institutions of Augustus was the establishment of the Praetorian Guard in 27&nbsp;BC, originally a personal bodyguard unit on the battlefield that evolved into an imperial guard as well as an important political force in Rome.<ref name=\"bunson 341\">Bunson (1994), 341.</ref> They had the power to intimidate the Senate, install new emperors, and depose ones they disliked; the last emperor they served was [[Maxentius]], as it was [[Constantine I]] who disbanded them in the early 4th century and destroyed their barracks, the [[Castra Praetoria]].<ref name=\"bunson 341 342\">Bunson (1994), 341\u2013342.</ref>\n\n[[File:Augustus-in-Kalabsha.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Augustus in an Egyptian-style depiction, a stone carving of the [[New Kalabsha|Kalabsha Temple]] in [[Nubia]]]]\nAlthough the most powerful individual in the Roman Empire, Augustus wished to embody the spirit of Republican virtue and norms. He also wanted to relate to and connect with the concerns of the plebs and lay people. He achieved this through various means of generosity and a cutting back of lavish excess. In the year 29&nbsp;BC, Augustus gave 400 sesterces (equal to 1/10 of a Roman pound of gold) each to 250,000 citizens, 1,000 sesterces each to 120,000 veterans in the colonies, and spent 700 million sesterces in purchasing land for his soldiers to settle upon.<ref name=\"ccaa 23\" /> He also restored 82 different temples to display his care for the [[Roman mythology|Roman pantheon]] of deities.<ref name=\"ccaa 23\">Eder (2005), 23.</ref> In 28&nbsp;BC, he melted down 80 silver statues erected in his likeness and in honor of him, an attempt of his to appear frugal and modest.<ref name=\"ccaa 23\" />\n\n[[File:KujulaKadphisesCoinAugustusImitation.jpg|thumb|left|Coin of [[Kushan]] ruler [[Kujula Kadphises]], in the style of Roman emperor Augustus.

As [[Tacitus]] wrote, the younger generations alive in AD 14 had never known any form of government other than the Principate.<ref>Tacitus, ''[[Annals (Tacitus)|Annals]]'' [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 1#3|I.3]]</ref> Had Augustus died earlier (in 23&nbsp;BC, for instance), matters might have turned out differently. The attrition of the civil wars on the old Republican oligarchy and the longevity of Augustus, therefore, must be seen as major contributing factors in the transformation of the Roman state into a [[de facto]] monarchy in these years. Augustus's own experience, his patience, his tact, and his political acumen also played their parts. He directed the future of the Empire down many lasting paths, from the existence of a standing professional army stationed at or near the frontiers, to the dynastic principle so often employed in the imperial succession, to the embellishment of the capital at the emperor's expense. Augustus's ultimate legacy was the peace and prosperity the Empire enjoyed for the next two centuries under the system he initiated. His memory was enshrined in the political ethos of the Imperial age as a paradigm of the good emperor. Every Emperor of Rome adopted his name, Caesar Augustus, which gradually lost its character as a name and eventually became a title.<ref name=\"eck 124\" /> The Augustan era poets Virgil and Horace praised Augustus as a defender of Rome, an upholder of moral justice, and an individual who bore the brunt of responsibility in maintaining the empire.<ref name=\"kelsall 120\">Kelsall (1976), 120.</ref>\n\nHowever, for his rule of Rome and establishing the principate, Augustus has also been subjected to criticism throughout the ages. The contemporary Roman jurist [[Marcus Antistius Labeo]] (d. AD 10/11), fond of the days of pre-Augustan republican [[liberty]] in which he had been born, openly criticized the Augustan regime. In the beginning of his ''[[Annals (Tacitus)|Annals]]'', the Roman historian [[Tacitus]] (c. 56\u2013c.117) wrote that Augustus had cunningly subverted Republican Rome into a position of slavery. He continued to say that, with Augustus's death and swearing of loyalty to Tiberius, the people of Rome simply traded one slaveholder for another.<ref name=\"starr 5\">Starr (1952), 5.</ref> Tacitus, however, records two contradictory but common views of Augustus:\n\n{{quote|Intelligent people praised or criticized him in varying ways. One opinion was as follows. Filial duty and a national emergency, in which there was no place for law-abiding conduct, had driven him to civil war\u2014and this can neither be initiated nor maintained by decent methods. He had made many concessions to Anthony and to Lepidus for the sake of vengeance on his father's murderers. When Lepidus grew old and lazy, and Anthony's self-indulgence got the better of him, the only possible cure for the distracted country had been government by one man. However, Augustus had put the state in order not by making himself king or dictator, but by creating the Principate. The Empire's frontiers were on the ocean, or distant rivers. Armies, provinces, fleets, the whole system was interrelated. Roman citizens were protected by the law. Provincials were decently treated. Rome itself had been lavishly beautified. Force had been sparingly used\u2014merely to preserve peace for the majority.<ref>Tacitus, The Annals, I 9</ref>}}\n[[File:Augustus Bronze X23322 NAMAthens.jpg|thumb|upright|Fragment of a bronze equestrian statue of Augustus, 1st century AD, [[National Archaeological Museum of Athens]]]]\n[[File:VirgilAeneidVI.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Virgil]] reading the [[Aeneid]] to Augustus and Octavia'', by [[Jean-Joseph Taillasson]], 1787]]\nAccording to the second opposing opinion:\n{{quote|filial duty and national crisis had been merely pretexts.

The story of his career shows that Augustus was indeed ruthless, cruel, and ambitious for himself. This was only in part a personal trait, for upper-class Romans were educated to compete with one another and to excel. However, he combined an overriding concern for his personal interests with a deep-seated patriotism, based on a nostalgia of Rome's antique virtues. In his capacity as ''princeps'', selfishness and selflessness coexisted in his mind. While fighting for dominance, he paid little attention to legality or to the normal civilities of political life. He was devious, untrustworthy, and bloodthirsty. But once he had established his authority, he governed efficiently and justly, generally allowed freedom of speech, and promoted the rule of law. He was immensely hardworking and tried as hard as any [[Democracy in Ancient Rome|democratic]] parliamentarian to treat his senatorial colleagues with respect and sensitivity. He suffered from no delusions of grandeur.<ref>[[Anthony Everitt|Everitt]] (2006), 324\u2013325.</ref>}}\n\nTacitus was of the belief that [[Nerva]] (r. 96\u201398) successfully \"mingled two formerly alien ideas, principate and liberty\".<ref name=\"starr 6\">Starr (1952), 6.</ref> The 3rd-century historian Cassius Dio acknowledged Augustus as a benign, moderate ruler, yet like most other historians after the death of Augustus, Dio viewed Augustus as an [[Autocracy|autocrat]].<ref name=\"starr 5\" /> The poet [[Marcus Annaeus Lucanus]] (AD 39\u201365) was of the opinion that Caesar's victory over Pompey and the fall of [[Cato the Younger]] (95 BC\u201346&nbsp;BC) marked the end of traditional liberty in Rome; historian Chester G. Starr, Jr. writes of his avoidance of criticizing Augustus, \"perhaps Augustus was too sacred a figure to accuse directly.\"<ref name=\"starr 6\" />\n\nThe [[Anglo-Irish]] writer [[Jonathan Swift]] (1667\u20131745), in his ''Discourse on the Contests and Dissentions in Athens and Rome'', criticized Augustus for installing tyranny over Rome, and likened what he believed [[United Kingdom|Great Britain]]'s virtuous [[constitutional monarchy]] to Rome's moral Republic of the 2nd century BC. In his criticism of Augustus, the admiral and historian [[Thomas Gordon (Royal Scots Navy officer)|Thomas Gordon]] (1658\u20131741) compared Augustus to the puritanical tyrant [[Oliver Cromwell]] (1599\u20131658).<ref name=\"kelsall 118\">Kelsall (1976), 118.</ref> Thomas Gordon and the French political philosopher [[Montesquieu]] (1689\u20131755) both remarked that Augustus was a coward in battle.<ref name=\"kelsall 119\">Kelsall (1976), 119.</ref> In his ''Memoirs of the Court of Augustus'', the Scottish scholar [[Thomas Blackwell (scholar)|Thomas Blackwell]] (1701\u20131757) deemed Augustus a [[Machiavelli]]an ruler, \"a bloodthirsty vindicative usurper\", \"wicked and worthless\", \"a mean spirit\", and a \"tyrant\".<ref name=\"kelsall 119\" />\n\n=== Revenue reforms ===\n[[File:AugustusCoinPudukottaiHoardIndia.jpg|thumb|left|Coin of Augustus found at the [[Pudukottai]] hoard, from an [[ancient Tamil country]], [[Pandyan Kingdom]] of present-day [[Tamil Nadu]] in India, a testimony to [[Indo-Roman trade]].

Augustus brought a far greater portion of the Empire's expanded land base under consistent, direct taxation from Rome, instead of exacting varying, intermittent, and somewhat arbitrary tributes from each local province as Augustus's predecessors had done. This reform greatly increased Rome's net revenue from its territorial acquisitions, stabilized its flow, and regularized the financial relationship between Rome and the provinces, rather than provoking fresh resentments with each new arbitrary exaction of tribute.<ref name=\"eck 83 84\">Eck (2003), 83\u201384.</ref>\n\nThe measures of taxation in the reign of Augustus were determined by population census, with fixed quotas for each province. Citizens of Rome and Italy paid indirect taxes, while direct taxes were exacted from the provinces. Indirect taxes included a 4% tax on the price of slaves, a 1% tax on goods sold at auction, and a 5% tax on the inheritance of estates valued at over 100,000 sesterces by persons other than the [[next of kin]].<ref name=\"bunson 404\">Bunson (1994), 404.</ref>\n\n[[File:HymiariteKingdomAugustusImitation1stCenturyCE.jpg|thumb|left|1st century coin of the [[Himyarite]] Kingdom, southern coast of the [[Arabian peninsula]]. This is also an imitation of a coin of Augustus.]]\n\nAn equally important reform was the abolition of private [[tax farming]], which was replaced by salaried civil service tax collectors. Private contractors who collected taxes for the State were the norm in the Republican era. Some of them were powerful enough to influence the number of votes for men running for offices in Rome. These tax farmers called publicans were infamous for their depredations, great private wealth, and the right to tax local areas.<ref name=\"eck 83 84\" />\n\nThe use of Egypt's immense land rents to finance the Empire's operations resulted from Augustus's conquest of Egypt and the shift to a Roman form of government.<ref name=\"bunson 144\">Bunson (1994), 144.</ref> As it was effectively considered Augustus's private property rather than a province of the Empire, it became part of each succeeding emperor's patrimonium.<ref name=\"bunson 144 145\">Bunson (1994), 144\u2013145.</ref> Instead of a legate or proconsul, Augustus installed a prefect from the equestrian class to administer Egypt and maintain its lucrative seaports; this position became the highest political achievement for any equestrian besides becoming [[Praetorian prefect|Prefect of the Praetorian Guard]].<ref name=\"bunson 145\">Bunson (1994), 145.</ref> The highly productive agricultural land of Egypt yielded enormous revenues that were available to Augustus and his successors to pay for public works and military expeditions.<ref name=\"bunson 144\" /> During his reign the [[Venatio|circus games]] resulted in the killing of 3,500 [[North African elephant|elephants]].<ref name=\"Woolf2007\">{{cite book|author=Greg Woolf|title=Ancient civilizations: the illustrated guide to belief, mythology, and art|url=https://books.google.com/?id=94NuSg3tlsgC&dq=ancient+civilizations+the+illustrated+guide+mythology&q=3%2C500+elephants|year=2007|publisher=Barnes & Noble|isbn=978-1-4351-0121-0|page=397}}</ref>\n\n=== Month of August ===\nThe month of August (Latin: ''Augustus'') is named after Augustus; until his time it was called [[Sextilis]] (named so because it had been the sixth month of the original [[Roman calendar]] and the Latin word for six is ''sex''). Commonly repeated lore has it that August has 31 days because Augustus wanted his month to match the length of Julius Caesar's July, but this is an invention of the 13th century scholar [[Johannes de Sacrobosco]]. Sextilis in fact had 31 days before it was renamed, and it was not chosen for its length (see [[Julian calendar]]). According to a ''senatus consultum'' quoted by [[Macrobius]], Sextilis was renamed to honor Augustus because several of the most significant events in his rise to power, culminating in the fall of Alexandria, fell in that month.<ref>Macrobius, ''Saturnalia'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Macrobius/Saturnalia/1*.html#12.35 1.12.35].</ref>\n\n=== Building projects ===\n{{Main|:Category:Augustan building projects}}\n{{Further|Vitruvius|De architectura}}\n[[File:RomaAraPacisDecorazioneVegetale.jpg|thumb|Close up on the sculpted detail of the [[Ara Pacis]] (Altar of Peace), 13&nbsp;BC to 9 BC]]\n\nOn his deathbed, Augustus boasted \"I found a Rome of bricks; I leave to you one of marble.\" Although there is some truth in the literal meaning of this, Cassius Dio asserts that it was a metaphor for the Empire's strength.<ref name=\"dio 56.30.3\">Dio [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/56*.html#30 56.30.3]</ref> [[Marble]] could be found in buildings of Rome before Augustus, but it was not extensively used as a building material until the reign of Augustus.<ref name=\"bunson 34\" />\n\nAlthough this did not apply to the [[Suburra|Subura]] slums, which were still as rickety and fire-prone as ever, he did leave a mark on the monumental topography of the centre and of the [[Campus Martius]], with the [[Ara Pacis]] (Altar of Peace) and monumental sundial, whose central [[gnomon]] was an [[obelisks of Rome|obelisk]] taken from Egypt.<ref name=\"eck 122\">Eck (2003), 122.</ref> The [[relief]] sculptures decorating the Ara Pacis visually augmented the written record of Augustus's triumphs in the ''Res Gestae''.

Even his [[Mausoleum of Augustus]] was built before his death to house members of his family.<ref name=\"eck 118 121\">Eck (2003), 118\u2013121</ref> To celebrate his victory at the Battle of Actium, the [[Arch of Augustus, Rome|Arch of Augustus]] was built in 29&nbsp;BC near the entrance of the [[Temple of Castor and Pollux]], and widened in 19&nbsp;BC to include a triple-arch design.<ref name=\"bunson 34\" />\n\n[[File:Vienne-RomanTemple2.JPG|thumb|The Temple of Augustus and [[Livia]] in [[Vienne, Is\u00e8re|Vienne]], late 1st century BC]]\nAfter the death of Agrippa in 12&nbsp;BC, a solution had to be found in maintaining Rome's water supply system. This came about because it was overseen by Agrippa when he served as aedile, and was even funded by him afterwards when he was a private citizen paying at his own expense. In that year, Augustus arranged a system where the Senate designated three of its members as prime commissioners in charge of the water supply and to ensure that Rome's aqueducts did not fall into disrepair.<ref name=\"eck 79\">Eck (2003), 79.</ref>\n\nIn the late Augustan era, the commission of five senators called the ''curatores locorum publicorum iudicandorum'' (translated as \"Supervisors of Public Property\") was put in charge of maintaining public buildings and temples of the state cult.<ref name=\"eck 79\" /> Augustus created the senatorial group of the ''curatores viarum'' (translated as \"Supervisors for Roads\") for the upkeep of roads; this senatorial commission worked with local officials and contractors to organize regular repairs.<ref name=\"eck 81\">Eck (2003), 81.</ref>\n\nThe [[Corinthian order]] of architectural style originating from ancient Greece was the dominant architectural style in the age of Augustus and the imperial phase of Rome. Suetonius once commented that Rome was unworthy of its status as an imperial capital, yet Augustus and Agrippa set out to dismantle this sentiment by transforming the appearance of Rome upon the classical Greek model.<ref name=\"bunson 34\">Bunson (1994), 34.</ref>\n\n== Physical appearance and official images ==\n[[File:SFEC BritMus Roman Modification1.jpg|thumb|The [[Mero\u00eb Head]] of Augustus, bronze [[Roman portraiture]] bust from [[Mero\u00eb]], [[Kingdom of Kush]] ([[Nubia]], modern Sudan), 27\u201325 BC]]\nHis biographer Suetonius, writing about a century after Augustus's death, described his appearance as: \"...&nbsp;unusually handsome and exceedingly graceful at all periods of his life, though he cared nothing for personal adornment.

His ears were of moderate size, and his nose projected a little at the top and then bent ever so slightly inward. His complexion was between dark and fair. He was short of stature, although Julius Marathus, his freedman and keeper of his records, says that he was five feet and nine inches (just under 5 ft. 7 in., or 1.70 meters, in modern height measurements), but this was concealed by the fine proportion and symmetry of his figure, and was noticeable only by comparison with some taller person standing beside him...\",<ref>Suetonius, ''Augustus'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Augustus*.html#79 79], translated by [[John Carew Rolfe|J.

It features the Japanese comedian [[Takeshi Kitano]] (also known as Beat Takeshi) as a Count who owns a castle and sets up difficult challenges for players (or a volunteer army) to get to him. The show has become a [[Cult following#Cult fans and media|cult television]] hit around the world.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.asianweek.com/2008/09/13/cool-japan-why-japanese-remakes-are-so-popular-on-american-tv-and-where-we%E2%80%99re-getting-it-wrong/ |title=Cool Japan: Why Japanese remakes are so popular on American TV, and where we\u2019re getting it wrong |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080915232726/http://www.asianweek.com/2008/09/13/cool-japan-why-japanese-remakes-are-so-popular-on-american-tv-and-where-we%E2%80%99re-getting-it-wrong/ |archivedate=2008-09-15}}</ref> A special live \"revival\" was broadcast on April 2, 2005, for TBS's 50th anniversary celebrations.\n\n==Original ''Takeshi's Castle''==\n\nThe original show involved between 86 and 142 contestants whom General Tani ([[Hayato Tani]]) \"forced\" into a series of physical challenges, in some ways similar to those in ''[[It's a Knockout]]'', eliminating many of the contestants. Each show finished with a \"Final Showdown\" in which Count Takeshi (Kitano) was faced by the remaining contestants. In early episodes they would storm the castle set itself in a short-range [[water gun]] assault. Later episodes introduced carts with paper rings, and eventually [[laser]]s and light-sensitive targets. If the contestant's gun penetrated the paper ring or hit the sensor on Takeshi's cart, against such weapons as a large water gun and a laser-armed plane, Takeshi's cart was deactivated, the castle was \"taken\" and the game \"won\". The player who stopped Takeshi won 1 million [[Japanese yen|yen]] (which, at the time, was roughly equivalent to [[United States dollar|$]]8,000 US or \u00a35,000 sterling). There were eight winners during the show's run.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}\n\nThe series featured extensive landscaping of a fixed campus at TBS-owned Midoriyama (Green Mountain) Studios that included large man-made lakes and extensive permanent obstacles in [[Yokohama|Yokohama, Japan]].

It originally aired in the mid to late 1980s where it became a cult hit.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} The show was syndicated to multiple TV stations across different countries, which was a common practise at the time for localised foreign programmes. Various public stations may re-run the show on non-specific occasions. Other than the voice-over commentary and the opening/closing themes, the episodes were largely retained as originally aired in Japan. Commentary was provided by Lebanese television personality Riad Sharara ({{lang|ar|\u0631\u064a\u0627\u0636 \u0634\u0631\u0627\u0631\u0629}}), then later by [[Jamal Rayyan]] ({{lang|ar|\u062c\u0645\u0627\u0644 \u0631\u064a\u0627\u0646}}), who is currently a well known news broadcaster in [[Al Jazeera]]'s Arabic TV news channel.

This has since been cancelled and/or finished. The show was hosted by two housemates from [[Big Brother 2 (Australia)|series two of Australian Big Brother]] Shannon Cleary and Nathan Morris. It also featured a crossdressing Geisha girl named Beryl. Some episodes featured a special guest third host, including Greg Fleet. Highlights appeared in Australia on the television program ''World's Weirdest TV''. The American version ''MXC'' currently airs on [[Fox8]] (an Australian cable network). The Australian writer and critic [[Clive James]] was once a celebrity contestant on the original show.\n\n===Brazil===\n{{BRA}} &mdash; During the 1990s, a version was aired by [[Rede Globo]], called '''Olimp\u00edadas do [[Fausto Silva|Faust\u00e3o]]''' (Portuguese for \"Faust\u00e3o's Olympics\"), as an insert in Fausto Silva's Sunday-afternoon variety show ''[[Doming\u00e3o do Faust\u00e3o]]''. In 1994, rival [[Sistema Brasileiro de Televis\u00e3o|SBT]] copied that version, and a legal action by Globo and SBT stopped the broadcasting.<ref>[http://www.idcid.org.br/GrupoEst_docs/BrazilianIPcases%20-%20final.pdf]{{dead link|date=March 2018}}</ref> On June 1, 2008, SBT Keshi remake reappeared on TV, now licensed, remaking Faust\u00e3o's known games (as Bridge Ball and The Run Way), not-seen in Globo games (as Skittles and Ride the Wave), and original games (cross a balance beam after spin, or cross a small bridge using a crank-kart). The games are a segment named \"Playtime\" in the \"Programa Silvio Santos\".\n\n{{Further|List of original challenges in Brazilian Takeshi's Castle}}\n\n===Czech Republic===\n{{CZE}} &mdash; It was shown by the name ''Take\u0161iho hrad'' ([[Czech language|Czech]]), with comedic voice-over by two Czech comedians. The commentary was mostly fictional. The show was popular among young viewers.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} The Czech TV channel also broadcast the show to Slovak Republic where it gained some popularity{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} as well. In 2011 was ''Take\u0161iho hrad'' broadcast on channel ''[[Prima Cool]]'' with a new single-voice comment.\n\n===Denmark===\n{{DEN}} &mdash; The [[Denmark|Danish]] TV station [[TV 2 Zulu]] bought the rights to air the Challenge version in Denmark, thus making the Danish broadcast identical to that in Britain.\n\n===Finland===\n{{FIN}} &mdash; On January 7, 2008, the television channel [[Jim (TV channel)|Jim]] started airing the UK version of the program. The comments are subtitled in Finnish. The show is titled '''Hullut japanilaiset'''.\n\n===France===\n{{FRA}} &mdash; A shortened version given a comedic{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} voiceover by comedians [[Vincent Desagnat]] and [[Benjamin Morgaine]] has been shown on the [[W9 (TV channel)|W9]] TV channel since October 2006, in a program called \"Menu W9\" (which also presented a shortened version of [[Sushi TV]] on its first season, now replaced by [[Sasuke (TV series)|Sasuke]]). It has been also broadcast on the channel [[M6 (TV channel)|M6]] which shown 2 episodes per day at 6.50 p.m from Tuesday to Friday. The voices were those of the late sport presenter [[Thierry Roland]] and [[Moon Dailly]].\n\n===Germany===\n{{GER}} &mdash; A dubbed version of the show aired on [[Sport1 (Germany)|DSF]] in 1999. This version was released on a DVD box set with 12 selected episodes. Two more volumes were planned but were presumably canceled. A German dubbed version of the 2002 UK edit airs from July 3, 2007 on [[RTL II]]. There also exists an adaptation called [[Entern oder Kentern]] (engl.: Board or Capsize) with almost the same games but pirates as antagonists and celebrities as Team Captains. This version was aired on [[RTL Television|RTL]] in summer 2007. Shorter versions of episodes with comical commentary air on Comedy Central.\n\n===Greece===\n{{GRE}} &mdash; A version airs on [[Skai TV]] by the name \"\u03a4\u03bf \u03ba\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03a4\u03b1\u03ba\u03ad\u03c3\u03b9\"(=Takeshi's Castle). It has been dubbed by Kostas Papageorgiou and Akindynos Gkikas.\n\n===India===\n{{IND}} &mdash; A shortened version of the show is aired on the [[Pogo (TV channel)|Pogo TV]] channel from 1 March 2005 with [[Hindi]] dubbing by [[Javed Jaffrey]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indiantelevision.com/headlines/y2k5/feb/feb254.htm|title=Pogo premiers Japanese game show 'Takeshi's Castle'|date=24 February 2005|accessdate=3 March 2018}}</ref> The show was also experimentally voiced by Indian comedians [[Raju Srivastav]], [[Sunil Pal]], [[Navin Prabhakar]] and [[Ahsaan Qureshi]] for a short duration.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indiantelevision.com/headlines/y2k6/mar/mar350.htm|title=Pogo lines up rib-tickling fare|date=March 27, 2006|accessdate=September 22, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Indonesia===\n{{IDN}} &mdash; The original Japanese show was being re-broadcast (with Indonesian dubs) on [[GTV (Indonesia)|GTV]] channel during the 1990s and early 2000s. In 2017, [[MNCTV]] acquired the license to remake the show which was later known as ''Takeshi's Castle Indonesia'' (a.k.a. Benteng Takeshi Indonesia) with a grand prize of Rp100.000.000,-. After two successful seasons, the show was originally planned to enter its third season in 2018; however, due to a drug case involving Reza Bukan (the cast of King Takeshi at that time) the launch of the third season was delayed until mid-2019.\n\nThe main cast of Takeshi's Castle Indonesia includes Fero Walandouw (as the Captain), Nabila Putri, Poppy Sovia, and Desi JKT48 (as Vice-Captains in Season 1, 2, and 3 respectively), Lee Jong Hoon (as the Reporter), and Reza Bukan and Kenta (as King Takeshi in season 1-2 and 3 respectively).\n\n===Iran===\n{{IRN}} &mdash; It was aired by the name ''Masir-e Talaa'ee'' ({{lang-fa|\u0645\u0633\u06cc\u0631 \u0637\u0644\u0627\u06cc\u06cc}}) (when translated it means \"Golden Path\"), on Iran's [[IRIB TV3|Channel 3]] on years 2009 and 2010. It was hosted by Morteza and Mostafa Hosseini, the brothers of the refugee host [[Seyed Mohammad Hosseini (showman)|Mohammad Hosseini]].\n\n===Italy===\n{{ITA}} &mdash; Renamed '''Mai dire Banzai''' (Never Say: Banzai!) it first aired in 1989 on [[Italia 1]]. A reedited version interspersed with clips of another Japanese gameshow called [[Za Gaman]], it was given a comedic voiceover by [[Gialappa's Band]], who changed Kitano's and Saburo Ishikura's names to Gennaro Olivieri and Guido Pancaldi, historically [[Swiss Italian]] judges in [[Jeux Sans Fronti\u00e8res|Games Without Frontiers]]. They also renamed in absurdist comical ways the other figures of the show like calling the in-game reporter 'Pokoto Pokoto', the martially-attire'd host 'General Putzersthoefen' and so on. Gialappa's Band making fun of the duty-bound, stoic stereotype of Japan, described the games and tasks as traditional Japanese past-times and thus rather mundane and humdrum by Japanese standards, introducing a veil of [[Non sequitur (literary device)|non sequitur]] to the show which is lacking in English language versions. \nThe show gained new popularity in the [[2000s (decade)|2000s]], when it started being broadcast on various satellite and terrestrial channels with the original title and using the half-hour episodes of the UK shortened version, with independent voiceover (superimposed to the still audible Japanese tack) done by various Italian comedians. As of 2008, this version is broadcast on [[GXT]] with the voiceover done by [[Trio Medusa]] (previously the show was commentated on by [[Marco Marzocca]] with [[Stefano Sarcinelli]] and still before by duo [[Lillo & Greg]]); shortly after it was re-aired by local broadcasters and by [[K2 (TV channel)|K2]]. From 10 January 2011, the series is re-transmitted in Italy on [[Cartoon Network (Italy)|Cartoon Network]] and the voiceover is done by Roberto Stocchi e Francesca Draghetti.\n\n===Lithuania===\n{{LTU}} &mdash; The show was aired by the name \"Take\u0161i pilis\", featuring [[Fumito Tomoi]] (a Japanese person living in Lithuania at the time), who dubbed the show in a comic way with his broken Lithuanian. The show was very popular.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}\n\n===Malaysia===\n{{MYS}} &mdash; The Japanese version was aired over [[NTV7]] in early 2000s, although edited to be shortened to half an hour. The broadcast was added with Malay overdub commentary (the original Japanese audio track is still audible in background). Sometimes in earlier versions, the unoverdubbed parts will be subtitled in Malay. The show was known as ''Istana Takeshi'' in Malaysia.\n\nAs of June 2010, the show is airing again using the [[Most Extreme Elimination Challenge|American]] version with Malay subtitles on [[TV9 (Malaysia)|TV9]] but still called Istana Takeshi instead of MXC.\n\n===Mexico===\n{{MEX}} &mdash; The Japanese version on [[XHDF|Azteca 13]] of [[TV Azteca]] in 1993 and [[XHIMT|Azteca 7]] of [[TV Azteca]] was aired in Mexico, which, like the Spanish, has its own stories and invented by giving voices teams.\n\nDue to the success of the American edits of Banzuke and Ninja Warrior/Sasuke on [[XHIMT|Azteca 7]], on May 4, 2015, the program was broadcast by [[XHGC|Canal 5]] of [[Televisa]], under the name \"Castillo Takeshi\" and narrated by two presenters from [[Televisa]] using the British edit as basis for their own edit. Possibly due to the upscaling from PAL to HD, it had a poor quality image, making it look even older than it was. It took the time slot where ABC's Wipeout had been broadcast since 2014. After just three weeks, the show was replaced by ABC's Wipeout, which has had a longer more successful run on Mexican TV.\n\n===Netherlands===\n{{NLD}} &mdash; The British cut of the show aired on August 15, 2009 on [[Comedy Central (Netherlands)|Comedy Central]], with Dutch voice-over provided by sports commentator Ronald van Dam and actor/comedian Ruben van der Meer.\nTakeshi's Castle Thailand in its UK format commenced airing on March 22, 2018 with commentary by actress/singer [[Katja Schuurman]] and vocalist Pepijn Lanen.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comedycentral.nl/nieuws/115088-takeshi-s-castle-terug-op-comedy-central|title=Takeshi's Castle terug op Comedy Central|publisher=Comedy Central|language=nl}}</ref>\n\n===Philippines===\n{{Infobox television\n| show_name = Takeshi's Castle\n| genre = [[Game show]]\n| picture_format = [[480i]] ([[SDTV]])\n| runtime = 30 minutes (60 minutes in IBC and SBN broadcasts)\n| creator = Tokyo Broadcasting System\n| executive_producer = [[Wilma Galvante]]\n| presenter = {{plainlist|\n* [[Joey de Leon]]\n* [[Ryan Yllana]]}}\n| country = [[Philippines]]\n| location = Philippines\n| language = [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]]\n| network = {{plainlist|\n* [[Intercontinental Broadcasting Corporation|IBC]]\n* [[Q (TV network)|Q]]\n* [[GMA Network]]}}\n| company = GMA Entertainment TV\n| camera = [[Multiple-camera setup]]\n| first_aired = October 1990 (IBC) - October 2007\n| last_aired = April 2008\n}}\n\n{{PHL}} - It was first shown on the [[Intercontinental Broadcasting Corporation]] TV network in October 1990 as a [[Filipino language|Filipino]]-dubbed show. Later episodes contained interludes shot on a studio with actors [[Anjo Yllana]] as Takesh and [[Smokey Manoloto]] as \"Iwakura\" providing the commentary with a gravelly Japanese accent, which was later dropped in favor of their natural voices. The Filipino production crew also developed on their relationship, with Iwakura often trying to trick Takeshi on several occasions. One episode which resulted in the contestants' victory was even written as Takeshi's worst [[nightmare]]; when Iwakura finally wakes him up, Takeshi is so [[Psychological trauma|traumatized]] that he asks to call off a scheduled taping. Makers of the malt drink brand [[Ovaltine]] created an in-show mini contest as part of a product endorsement deal in 1991. In this version, the names given to most of the challenges are translated from their original Japanese such as \"Devil's Maze\" for the Honeycomb and Square Mazes, \"Flying Mushroom\" for Mushroom Trip, and \"Sumo Wrestling\" for Sumo Rings.\n\nThe IBC episodes of Takeshi's Castle were later rerun on [[Southern Broadcasting Network|SBN]] during 1993 and 1994. The show was not edited as before at IBC.\n\n''Takeshi's Castle'' enjoyed a revival in the Philippines in 2006. This time around, comedians [[Joey de Leon]] and [[Ryan Yllana]] (Anjo's younger brother) provide the commentary as fictional characters shogun Shintaro \"Taru\" Gokoyami who is Takeshi's right-hand man and sumo wrestler Kakawate Takehome, the leader of the Takeshi Gundan, fictional in the sense that there are no such characters in the original cast. Initially, the two provide play-by-play commentary, but they as well as some added characters reduced themselves to skits and commentary in between clips of the show. Later, as part of Q's first anniversary, Anjo finally appeared alongside the new cast, reprising his role as \"prince\" Takeshi.\nDue to Takeshi's Castle's competitive ratings, the management of GMA Network (which produces shows for its sister network Q) decided to move the show from its original station in an evening slot, now to the early afternoon weekend slot of GMA. Takeshi's Castle is aired on a weekly basis as opposed to the weekdays airing on Q, and is aired before Eat Bulaga on Saturdays and before SOP on Sundays. This is done to increase and improve the ratings of the succeeding shows. ''Takeshi's Castle'' started to air on GMA on December 23, 2006 with same hosts. The show aired on its last episode on May 9, 2007, and after a long break of TV experience, Joey and Ryan assumed new personalities as Master GT (later Tirso Potter) and Captain B respectively. It was temporarily replaced by \"[[Just Joking]]\" which starred also Joey De Leon and Ryan Yllana and other casts. On August 15, 2007, \"Takeshi's Castle\" returned on air once again with all new episodes and Mike \"Pekto\" Nacua (Cookie), John Feir (Belli) and Love A\u00f1over (replacement when either Cookie or Belli was not in) become commentators. The show aired at Saturdays 11:30&nbsp;a.m. before \"[[Eat Bulaga!]]\", and Sundays 11:15&nbsp;a.m. before [[SOP (Philippine TV series)|SOP Rules]].\nOn GMA's regional networks, a [[Cebuano language|Cebuano]]-dubbed show now on [[DYSS-TV|GMA Cebu]] & [[DXMJ-TV|Davao]] from Saturdays and Sundays in the Morning by Cebuano version from title called '''Takeshi's Castle Wala Gyud sa Isaysay Banzai!''' (Never Say Banzai!).\n\n===Portugal===\n{{POR}} &mdash; A version called '''Nunca Digas Banzai''' (Portuguese for \"Never Say Banzai\", based on the Italian name for it, '''Mai Dire Banzai''') aired on [[Sociedade Independente de Comunica\u00e7\u00e3o|SIC]] starting in 1994, where it reached some popularity.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} Voiceovers were provided by two hosts, [[Jos\u00e9 Carlos Malato]] and Jo\u00e3o Carlos Vaz. Takeshi and Ishikura were renamed \"Fujimoto\" and \"Fujicarro\" (a play on the Portuguese words for \"[motor]bike\" and \"car\" using the Japanese word [[wikt:fuji|Fuji]]), and the Portuguese hosts made no attempt to interpret the reality of the show, instead using the contestants as surrogates for the satirical comments about Portuguese public figures, in a similar style to MXC.\n\n===Russia===\n{{RUS}} - The series were featured in [[Ren TV]] project show \"The Best Shows of the World\" (\u041b\u0443\u0447\u0448\u0438\u0435 \u0448\u043e\u0443 \u043c\u0438\u0440\u0430) in the early 2000s and due to positive public reaction were aired on the regular basis on its own, named \"Takeshi Kitano's Castle\" (\u0417\u0430\u043c\u043e\u043a \u0422\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0448\u0438 \u041a\u0438\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043e). Show was translated and aired on [[2\u00d72 (TV channel)|2x2]] channel as \"Japanese amusements\" (\u042f\u043f\u043e\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u0431\u0430\u0432\u044b) during 2011-2012 and in 2013-2014. The format of the show is the translated commentary version of UK adaptation.\n\n===Serbia===\n{{SRB}} - Show started with showing on FOX TV in January 2010 named ''Take\u0161i''.\n\n===Singapore===\n\n{{SGP}} - The show first debut in the early-1990s on Singapore's free-to-air channel, Channel 8, as \"100 Wars\" ({{zh|\u767e\u6230\u767e\u52dd}}), as the program was acquired from Taiwan. In the mid 1990s till early 2000s, re-runs of the show aired on Saturdays at 1.30 pm in the afternoon, following the News on Channel 8.\n\n===Slovakia===\n{{SVK}} &mdash; During the 2011-2012 was [https://web.archive.org/web/20120713005200/http://www.joj.sk/takesiho-hrad/takesiho-hrad-o-relacii.html Take\u0161iho hrad] ([[Slovak language|Slovak]]) broadcast on channel [http://plus.joj.sk/ Joj Plus] with a single-voice Slovak comment.\n\n===South Africa===\n{{RSA}}\n\u2014\nThe show was broadcast daily on the Sony MAX channel, Channel 128 on [[DStv]]. It was the condensed version of the original series with commentary provided by Craig Charles. It began broadcasting in 2009 and was a huge hit with viewers. Due to its popularity the show has been aired to a broader audience on [[South African Broadcasting Corporation|SABC]] 2.\n\n===Spain===\n{{ESP}} &mdash; The program aired in the 1990s as '''Humor Amarillo''' (when translated it means \"Yellow Humour\" or \"Yellow Comedy\") on TV channel [[Telecinco]]. Comedians Juan Herrera and [[Miguel \u00c1ngel Coll]] (son of [[Jos\u00e9 Luis Coll]]) commented on the images; this version of the show has achieved cult status and there are some fansites and web petitions for returns. In fact, the Spanish version created some terms now familiar to either ''Takeshi's Castle'' or ''Humor Amarillo'', like \"El Laberinto del Chinotauro\" (literally ''The Chinesetaur Labyrinth'', name for any of the maze challenges), \"Los ca\u00f1ones de Nakasone\" (parody of \"Guns of Navarone\" Spanish title), \"Las Zamburguesas\" (for Skipping Stones),\"Gacela Thompson\" (\"Thompson Gazelle\"), a pathetic businessman character, and \"Chino Cudeiro\" (The Chinese Cudeiro, as the name started to be assigned when appeared a player with a red T-shirt with the inscription \"Cudeiro, Galicia, Espa\u00f1a\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://los80.lacoctelera.net/post/2005/11/25/humor-amarillo |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-07 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140107164658/http://los80.lacoctelera.net/post/2005/11/25/humor-amarillo |archivedate=2014-01-07}}</ref>), the name assigned to a random player that always \"dies\", one of the most popular characters in Spain. On January 28, 2006, a second version dubbed by [[Fernando Costilla]] and [[Paco Bravo]] premiered on Spanish TV channel [[Cuatro (TV channel)|Cuatro]]. They have shown every one of the original Japanese episodes, with the last one being shown on June 9, 2007, ending with a special message by the Spanish commentators.\nThe 2006 version is currently being rebroadcast on the [[Telecinco]]-owned channel [[Energy (TV channel)|Energy]].\n\nThese two versions had in common that it was naturally assumed that the dubbing was completely unrelated to the original dialogues, to the point that sometimes the references to the actual contest were really few. The commentators could turn the contestants into mushroom seekers, or people looking for a new apartment. Alongside the spectacular hits suffered by the contestants and the show's peculiar aesthetic, this helped boost its popularity.\n\n===Taiwan===\n{{TWN}} &mdash; A gameshow called ''100 Wars, 100 Victories'' ({{zh|\u767e\u6230\u767e\u52dd}})  on [[Chinese Television System|CTS]] was formed from the original show, similar to how ''MXC Almost Live'' was formed.\n\n===Thailand===\n{{THA}} &mdash; Takeshi's Castle was dubbed and shown on Channel 5 in 1988 - 1995. The title was changed to \"Hod, Mun, Ha\" (\u0e42\u0e2b\u0e14 \u0e21\u0e31\u0e19 \u0e2e\u0e32), or \"Cruel, Thrilling, Fun\".\n\nIn 2007, the unedited original series with bilingual soundtrack (Thai & Japanese) was aired on X-ZYTE channel on [[TrueVisions]] cable TV every Sunday and rerun several times throughout a week.\n\nIn 2014, [[Channel 7 (Thailand)]] bought the rights to remake the show. \"\u0e42\u0e2b\u0e14 \u0e21\u0e31\u0e19 \u0e2e\u0e32 Takeshi's Castle Thailand\" first aired on 20 July, with a new episode airing most Sundays. The show's format is identical to the one used in the original show, but with a few minor changes. Shogun Takeshi (Note Chernyim) has kept Princess Woosenko (Woonsen Virithipa Pakdeeprasong) as a prisoner in his castle. General Shahkrit (Shahkrit Yamnarm) attempts to rescue the princess from the castle by sending his army of contestants through Shogun's challenges (remade challenges include Slippery Wall, Avalanche, Honeycomb Maze, Skipping Stones, Slip Way, Sumo Rings, Wet Paint, and Tug Of War), and the last remaining contestants battle against Shogun's guards in the Showdown. Any winners receive the 1,000,000 Thai-baht cash prize, the cash prize is rolled over to the next episode if there are no winners\n\nLater on, the show reduced the number of competitors to 20, and then 12 in current shows. With the rules format changing, the competitors don't get eliminated throughout the show, but instead work as a team. The competitors are given, by Shogun Takeshi, 10 carts and the Shogun has no guard carts at the beginning of the episode. The competitors then play 5 challenges before the Showdown. In the first challenge, usually involved all the competitors playing at the same time, every single competitors must pass the challenge, while the subsequent challenges needs at most 5 passes in order to be credited as a win. Winning a challenge will cause the situation remaining unchanged, while losing the first challenge takes one cart away from the competitors team and one cart added to Shogun's team in Showdown. In subsequent challenges, one car is taken away and added to Shogun's team if less than 5 competitors passed, two cars are taken if less than 3 competitors passed. In current shows, with 12 competitors, two cars are taken away if less than 3 competitors passed, while 3 passes are credit with a win, and no cars are taken away. Losing a challenge also results in a punishment for the competitors in various ways, usually messy and painful. In Showdown, the team sends out two competitors per one cart they have to battle with Shogun's guards. Succeeding in Battle awards all competitors a share of 5,000,000 baht cash prize, but the prize is remain the same in all episodes.\n\n===Ukraine===\n{{UKR}} \u2014 Show was translated and aired on [[QTV (Ukraine)|QTV]] channel as \u00abLaughter with Takeshi Kitano\u00bb (\u0420\u0435\u0433\u043e\u0442\u043d\u044f \u0437 \u0422\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0448\u0456 \u041a\u0456\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043e) during 2008-2010.\n\n===United Kingdom===\n{{Infobox television |\n|show_name = '''Takeshi's Castle'''\n|image = [[File:Takeshi's Castel Comedy.jpg|220 px]]\n|picture_format = [[576i]] ([[Aspect ratio (image)#4:3|4:3]] [[Standard-definition television|SDTV]])\n|runtime = 30 minutes<br>60 minutes (specials)\n|creator = Tokyo Broadcasting System\n|writer = Ben Mole <br> Craig Charles <br> Alex Mole <br> Frederick Hutton Mills\n|editor = Anna Skidmore <br> Eion Martin <br> Duncan Armstrong <br> Colm O'Rourke <br> Andrew Trussler\n|director =\n|executive_producer = Ben Mole (2002\u20132004) <br> Sophie Hodgkins (2013)\n|starring =\n|narrated = [[Craig Charles]] (2002\u20132004)<br>[[Dick & Dom]] (2013)<br>[[Jonathan Ross]] (2017\u20132018) <br>[[Roman Kemp]] (2018) <br>[[Guz Khan]] (2019-)\n|country = {{flag|United Kingdom}}\n|language = English\n|network = [[Challenge (TV channel)|Challenge]] (2002\u20132004, 2013)<br>[[Comedy Central (UK and Ireland)|Comedy Central]] (2017\u2013)\n|company = [[Living TV Group|Flextech]]/Black Mole Films (2002\u20132004)<br>[[BSkyB|Sky]]/TBS (2013)\n|first_aired = '''Original series'''<br> 9 November 2002\u20131 January 2004 <br> '''First revived series''' <br> 8\u201329 March 2013 <br> '''Second revived series''' <br> 26 October 2017\u2013present \n|num_episodes = '''Original series''' <br> 145 (inc. 10 Specials and 13 Best Ofs) <br> '''First revived series''' <br> 6\n|list_episodes =\n|theme_music_composer = Jonathan Czerwik\n|opentheme = \"Takeshi's Castle\" <br> by Jonathan Czerwik\n|endtheme = \"Takeshi's Castle\" Shortened Instrumental\n|preceded_by =\n|followed_by =\n|website = http://www.challenge.co.uk/takeshis-castle/\n}}\n\n{{UK}} &mdash; The show was first introduced to British audiences in the late 1980s, when it was featured semi-regularly as part of LWT's ''[[...on Television|Tarrant on TV]]'', in which broadcaster [[Chris Tarrant]] showcased a variety of unusual television programmes from around the world. One of the series' previous hosts, [[Clive James]], appeared in an original Japanese episode as an international contestant - with behind the scenes footage shown as part of his two-part ITV documentary ''...in Japan'' in 1987.\n\n''Takeshi's Castle'' would become more well-known later when a condensed version of the original series proved an unexpected hit when it premiered on Challenge on 9 November 2002, regularly dominating the top ten programmes on the channel each week.\n\nThe UK format did not follow the original Japanese format - instead presenting each sequence of games as comic martial challenges leading to the final game wherein contestants not so far eliminated try to storm Takeshi's Castle. Each episode in the original run was narrated by [[Craig Charles]], who also coined the term \"Keshi Heads\" to describe avid fans of the show. A typical episode of the UK format of Takeshi's Castle has about eight games, followed by the final Showdown. After each event, a 'Ridiculous Replay' is shown, highlighting the most entertaining attempt. Challenge decided to edit out the comedy sketches between Takeshi and Higashi to allow more (or fewer) games to be shown during the half-hour block.\n\nMore series were commissioned and shown over the next few months, culminating in a series of hour-long specials in the Autumn of 2003, and a special highlights show, ''The A-Z of Takeshi's Castle'', broadcast on January 1, 2004 which showed some of the best clips of the best games as the last original series finale. Repeats still air regularly to this day on [[Challenge (TV channel)|Challenge]], with an average of 130,000 viewers an episode. On 3 September 2005, ''MXC'' aired for the first time in the UK on Challenge.\n\nOn 9 May 2007, ''[[The Paul O'Grady Show]]'' had their own mini ''Takeshi's Castle'' challenge, including 'Knock Knock', 'Bite the Bun', a \"Bridge Ball\" adaptation called 'Balancing Act' and the 'Slippery Wall'. The UK TV series returned to Challenge after a hiatus on 7 September 2009 with a modified opening sequence (to fit with Flextech rebranding to [[Living TV Group|Virgin Media Television]]).\n\nIn February 2010, a [http://www.keshiheads.co.uk/takeshi2012.html campaign] was launched by fansite [http://www.keshiheads.co.uk Keshi Heads] in an attempt to bring a brand new series of ''Takeshi's Castle'' to Challenge within its 10th anniversary year on the channel (November 2012-13). It was suggested by campaigners that these new episodes would feature never-before-seen games (previously completely cut from other episodes), and feature five Japanese episodes new to the UK, including the Pilot and an International Special which have never been seen on TV since their original airings in Japan.\n\nOn 13 December 2012, [https://twitter.com/ChallengeTV/status/279182737548664832 Challenge announced] that they had signed a deal for \"unseen bits of Takeshi's Castle\". The new series, named ''Takeshi's Castle Rebooted'', which aired from 8 to 29 March 2013, featured games and episodes suggested by the Keshi Heads website in their campaign. Despite Craig Charles [https://twitter.com/CCfunkandsoul/status/302811280010514433 agreeing to return for the new series], Challenge brought in [[Richard McCourt]] and [[Dominic Wood]] ([[Dick and Dom]]) as the new voiceovers. Hayato Tani also filmed presentation links for the new series.\n\n''Rebooted'' disappointed fans, with many complaining about Charles' replacement as voiceover.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} Challenge reportedly received more negative comments about ''Rebooted'', on their social media accounts, than any other show in the channel's history, with the series never once reaching its weekly top ten ratings.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} The original episodes returned to Challenge after ''Rebooted'' ended its run. In contrast to the newly produced series, these entered the weekly top ten rating shows almost instantly upon their return. ''Rebooted'' has since been repeated in off-peak timeslots.\n\nA new series of ''Takeshi's Castle'' aired on [[Comedy Central (UK and Ireland)|Comedy Central]], with [[Jonathan Ross]] as voiceover.<ref>\"[http://www.digitalspy.com/tv/news/a839650/takeshis-castle-returning-without-craig-charles/ Takeshi's Castle is returning to UK television, but Craig Charles will be replaced as commentator]\", Digital Spy</ref> This version used footage from the Thailand series.

The show has been broadcast in Canada, Australia and New Zealand.\n\nTwo attempts were made to Americanize the format:\n\n*On July 28, 1990, [[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX]] aired a special half-hour version of the original show premise entitled ''King of the Mountain'' which was packaged by Fox Square Productions and was hosted by John Mulrooney and Judy Toll. This version used the same games, but had only 10 competitors and no costumed characters to impede the players' progress. This American attempt only taped two episodes on July 24, 1988, and only one aired. Footage from the show was also used on episode 106 of Takeshi's Castle.\n*On June 16, 1993, [[CBS]] aired the second attempt, entitled ''Storm the Castle''. This hour-long version, which was packaged by [[Vin Di Bona]] Productions and hosted by [[Michael Burger]] and [[Nely Gal\u00e1n]], pitted 30 families against each other and against well-known [[monster]]s (such as [[Beetlejuice]]) in a quest to win $15,000. Unlike ''Mountain'', ''Storm'' had a few exclusive games not seen anywhere else. ''Storm'', like ''Mountain'', only lasted a single episode. The show was notable as future NFL player [[Christian Fauria]] appeared with his family.\n\n===Vietnam===\n{{VIE}} - The Vietnamese show ''\u0110\u1ea1i N\u00e1o Th\u00e0nh Takeshi'' produced under license, with the first episode airing March 25, 2017 in prime time on [[Vietnam Television|VTV3]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vtv.vn/truyen-hinh/gameshow-dai-nao-thanh-takeshi-chinh-thuc-ra-mat-khan-gia-20170324112007781.htm|title=Gameshow \u0110\u1ea1i n\u00e1o th\u00e0nh Takeshi ch\u00ednh th\u1ee9c ra m\u1eaft kh\u00e1n gi\u1ea3|publisher=Vietnam Television|accessdate=25 March 2017}}</ref> The program features famous Vietnamese artists, with warlords Takeshi played by Tr\u1ea5n Th\u00e0nh and Sharkito by Tr\u01b0\u01a1ng Th\u1ebf Vinh, and Princess Woonsenko played by Di\u1ec5m My 9X.

Each show finished with a \"Final Showdown\" in which Count Takeshi (Kitano) was faced by the remaining contestants. In early episodes they would storm the castle set itself in a short-range [[water gun]] assault. Later episodes introduced carts with paper rings, and eventually [[laser]]s and light-sensitive targets. If the contestant's gun penetrated the paper ring or hit the sensor on Takeshi's cart, against such weapons as a large water gun and a laser-armed plane, Takeshi's cart was deactivated, the castle was \"taken\" and the game \"won\". The player who stopped Takeshi won 1 million [[Japanese yen|yen]] (which, at the time, was roughly equivalent to [[United States dollar|$]]8,000 US or \u00a35,000 sterling). There were eight winners during the show's run.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}\n\nThe series featured extensive landscaping of a fixed campus at TBS-owned Midoriyama (Green Mountain) Studios that included large man-made lakes and extensive permanent obstacles in [[Yokohama|Yokohama, Japan]]. The final regular episode aired on April 14, 1989 followed by 4 one-off specials up until October 19, 1990.

It originally aired in the mid to late 1980s where it became a cult hit.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} The show was syndicated to multiple TV stations across different countries, which was a common practise at the time for localised foreign programmes. Various public stations may re-run the show on non-specific occasions. Other than the voice-over commentary and the opening/closing themes, the episodes were largely retained as originally aired in Japan. Commentary was provided by Lebanese television personality Riad Sharara ({{lang|ar|\u0631\u064a\u0627\u0636 \u0634\u0631\u0627\u0631\u0629}}), then later by [[Jamal Rayyan]] ({{lang|ar|\u062c\u0645\u0627\u0644 \u0631\u064a\u0627\u0646}}), who is currently a well known news broadcaster in [[Al Jazeera]]'s Arabic TV news channel.

This has since been cancelled and/or finished. The show was hosted by two housemates from [[Big Brother 2 (Australia)|series two of Australian Big Brother]] Shannon Cleary and Nathan Morris. It also featured a crossdressing Geisha girl named Beryl. Some episodes featured a special guest third host, including Greg Fleet. Highlights appeared in Australia on the television program ''World's Weirdest TV''. The American version ''MXC'' currently airs on [[Fox8]] (an Australian cable network). The Australian writer and critic [[Clive James]] was once a celebrity contestant on the original show.\n\n===Brazil===\n{{BRA}} &mdash; During the 1990s, a version was aired by [[Rede Globo]], called '''Olimp\u00edadas do [[Fausto Silva|Faust\u00e3o]]''' (Portuguese for \"Faust\u00e3o's Olympics\"), as an insert in Fausto Silva's Sunday-afternoon variety show ''[[Doming\u00e3o do Faust\u00e3o]]''. In 1994, rival [[Sistema Brasileiro de Televis\u00e3o|SBT]] copied that version, and a legal action by Globo and SBT stopped the broadcasting.<ref>[http://www.idcid.org.br/GrupoEst_docs/BrazilianIPcases%20-%20final.pdf]{{dead link|date=March 2018}}</ref> On June 1, 2008, SBT Keshi remake reappeared on TV, now licensed, remaking Faust\u00e3o's known games (as Bridge Ball and The Run Way), not-seen in Globo games (as Skittles and Ride the Wave), and original games (cross a balance beam after spin, or cross a small bridge using a crank-kart). The games are a segment named \"Playtime\" in the \"Programa Silvio Santos\".\n\n{{Further|List of original challenges in Brazilian Takeshi's Castle}}\n\n===Czech Republic===\n{{CZE}} &mdash; It was shown by the name ''Take\u0161iho hrad'' ([[Czech language|Czech]]), with comedic voice-over by two Czech comedians. The commentary was mostly fictional. The show was popular among young viewers.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} The Czech TV channel also broadcast the show to Slovak Republic where it gained some popularity{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} as well. In 2011 was ''Take\u0161iho hrad'' broadcast on channel ''[[Prima Cool]]'' with a new single-voice comment.\n\n===Denmark===\n{{DEN}} &mdash; The [[Denmark|Danish]] TV station [[TV 2 Zulu]] bought the rights to air the Challenge version in Denmark, thus making the Danish broadcast identical to that in Britain.\n\n===Finland===\n{{FIN}} &mdash; On January 7, 2008, the television channel [[Jim (TV channel)|Jim]] started airing the UK version of the program. The comments are subtitled in Finnish. The show is titled '''Hullut japanilaiset'''.\n\n===France===\n{{FRA}} &mdash; A shortened version given a comedic{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} voiceover by comedians [[Vincent Desagnat]] and [[Benjamin Morgaine]] has been shown on the [[W9 (TV channel)|W9]] TV channel since October 2006, in a program called \"Menu W9\" (which also presented a shortened version of [[Sushi TV]] on its first season, now replaced by [[Sasuke (TV series)|Sasuke]]). It has been also broadcast on the channel [[M6 (TV channel)|M6]] which shown 2 episodes per day at 6.50 p.m from Tuesday to Friday. The voices were those of the late sport presenter [[Thierry Roland]] and [[Moon Dailly]].\n\n===Germany===\n{{GER}} &mdash; A dubbed version of the show aired on [[Sport1 (Germany)|DSF]] in 1999. This version was released on a DVD box set with 12 selected episodes. Two more volumes were planned but were presumably canceled. A German dubbed version of the 2002 UK edit airs from July 3, 2007 on [[RTL II]]. There also exists an adaptation called [[Entern oder Kentern]] (engl.: Board or Capsize) with almost the same games but pirates as antagonists and celebrities as Team Captains. This version was aired on [[RTL Television|RTL]] in summer 2007. Shorter versions of episodes with comical commentary air on Comedy Central.\n\n===Greece===\n{{GRE}} &mdash; A version airs on [[Skai TV]] by the name \"\u03a4\u03bf \u03ba\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03a4\u03b1\u03ba\u03ad\u03c3\u03b9\"(=Takeshi's Castle). It has been dubbed by Kostas Papageorgiou and Akindynos Gkikas.\n\n===India===\n{{IND}} &mdash; A shortened version of the show is aired on the [[Pogo (TV channel)|Pogo TV]] channel from 1 March 2005 with [[Hindi]] dubbing by [[Javed Jaffrey]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indiantelevision.com/headlines/y2k5/feb/feb254.htm|title=Pogo premiers Japanese game show 'Takeshi's Castle'|date=24 February 2005|accessdate=3 March 2018}}</ref> The show was also experimentally voiced by Indian comedians [[Raju Srivastav]], [[Sunil Pal]], [[Navin Prabhakar]] and [[Ahsaan Qureshi]] for a short duration.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indiantelevision.com/headlines/y2k6/mar/mar350.htm|title=Pogo lines up rib-tickling fare|date=March 27, 2006|accessdate=September 22, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Indonesia===\n{{IDN}} &mdash; The original Japanese show was being re-broadcast (with Indonesian dubs) on [[GTV (Indonesia)|GTV]] channel during the 1990s and early 2000s. In 2017, [[MNCTV]] acquired the license to remake the show which was later known as ''Takeshi's Castle Indonesia'' (a.k.a. Benteng Takeshi Indonesia) with a grand prize of Rp100.000.000,-. After two successful seasons, the show was originally planned to enter its third season in 2018; however, due to a drug case involving Reza Bukan (the cast of King Takeshi at that time) the launch of the third season was delayed until mid-2019.\n\nThe main cast of Takeshi's Castle Indonesia includes Fero Walandouw (as the Captain), Nabila Putri, Poppy Sovia, and Desi JKT48 (as Vice-Captains in Season 1, 2, and 3 respectively), Lee Jong Hoon (as the Reporter), and Reza Bukan and Kenta (as King Takeshi in season 1-2 and 3 respectively).\n\n===Iran===\n{{IRN}} &mdash; It was aired by the name ''Masir-e Talaa'ee'' ({{lang-fa|\u0645\u0633\u06cc\u0631 \u0637\u0644\u0627\u06cc\u06cc}}) (when translated it means \"Golden Path\"), on Iran's [[IRIB TV3|Channel 3]] on years 2009 and 2010. It was hosted by Morteza and Mostafa Hosseini, the brothers of the refugee host [[Seyed Mohammad Hosseini (showman)|Mohammad Hosseini]].\n\n===Italy===\n{{ITA}} &mdash; Renamed '''Mai dire Banzai''' (Never Say: Banzai!) it first aired in 1989 on [[Italia 1]]. A reedited version interspersed with clips of another Japanese gameshow called [[Za Gaman]], it was given a comedic voiceover by [[Gialappa's Band]], who changed Kitano's and Saburo Ishikura's names to Gennaro Olivieri and Guido Pancaldi, historically [[Swiss Italian]] judges in [[Jeux Sans Fronti\u00e8res|Games Without Frontiers]]. They also renamed in absurdist comical ways the other figures of the show like calling the in-game reporter 'Pokoto Pokoto', the martially-attire'd host 'General Putzersthoefen' and so on. Gialappa's Band making fun of the duty-bound, stoic stereotype of Japan, described the games and tasks as traditional Japanese past-times and thus rather mundane and humdrum by Japanese standards, introducing a veil of [[Non sequitur (literary device)|non sequitur]] to the show which is lacking in English language versions. \nThe show gained new popularity in the [[2000s (decade)|2000s]], when it started being broadcast on various satellite and terrestrial channels with the original title and using the half-hour episodes of the UK shortened version, with independent voiceover (superimposed to the still audible Japanese tack) done by various Italian comedians. As of 2008, this version is broadcast on [[GXT]] with the voiceover done by [[Trio Medusa]] (previously the show was commentated on by [[Marco Marzocca]] with [[Stefano Sarcinelli]] and still before by duo [[Lillo & Greg]]); shortly after it was re-aired by local broadcasters and by [[K2 (TV channel)|K2]]. From 10 January 2011, the series is re-transmitted in Italy on [[Cartoon Network (Italy)|Cartoon Network]] and the voiceover is done by Roberto Stocchi e Francesca Draghetti.\n\n===Lithuania===\n{{LTU}} &mdash; The show was aired by the name \"Take\u0161i pilis\", featuring [[Fumito Tomoi]] (a Japanese person living in Lithuania at the time), who dubbed the show in a comic way with his broken Lithuanian. The show was very popular.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}\n\n===Malaysia===\n{{MYS}} &mdash; The Japanese version was aired over [[NTV7]] in early 2000s, although edited to be shortened to half an hour. The broadcast was added with Malay overdub commentary (the original Japanese audio track is still audible in background). Sometimes in earlier versions, the unoverdubbed parts will be subtitled in Malay. The show was known as ''Istana Takeshi'' in Malaysia.\n\nAs of June 2010, the show is airing again using the [[Most Extreme Elimination Challenge|American]] version with Malay subtitles on [[TV9 (Malaysia)|TV9]] but still called Istana Takeshi instead of MXC.\n\n===Mexico===\n{{MEX}} &mdash; The Japanese version on [[XHDF|Azteca 13]] of [[TV Azteca]] in 1993 and [[XHIMT|Azteca 7]] of [[TV Azteca]] was aired in Mexico, which, like the Spanish, has its own stories and invented by giving voices teams.\n\nDue to the success of the American edits of Banzuke and Ninja Warrior/Sasuke on [[XHIMT|Azteca 7]], on May 4, 2015, the program was broadcast by [[XHGC|Canal 5]] of [[Televisa]], under the name \"Castillo Takeshi\" and narrated by two presenters from [[Televisa]] using the British edit as basis for their own edit. Possibly due to the upscaling from PAL to HD, it had a poor quality image, making it look even older than it was. It took the time slot where ABC's Wipeout had been broadcast since 2014. After just three weeks, the show was replaced by ABC's Wipeout, which has had a longer more successful run on Mexican TV.\n\n===Netherlands===\n{{NLD}} &mdash; The British cut of the show aired on August 15, 2009 on [[Comedy Central (Netherlands)|Comedy Central]], with Dutch voice-over provided by sports commentator Ronald van Dam and actor/comedian Ruben van der Meer.\nTakeshi's Castle Thailand in its UK format commenced airing on March 22, 2018 with commentary by actress/singer [[Katja Schuurman]] and vocalist Pepijn Lanen.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comedycentral.nl/nieuws/115088-takeshi-s-castle-terug-op-comedy-central|title=Takeshi's Castle terug op Comedy Central|publisher=Comedy Central|language=nl}}</ref>\n\n===Philippines===\n{{Infobox television\n| show_name = Takeshi's Castle\n| genre = [[Game show]]\n| picture_format = [[480i]] ([[SDTV]])\n| runtime = 30 minutes (60 minutes in IBC and SBN broadcasts)\n| creator = Tokyo Broadcasting System\n| executive_producer = [[Wilma Galvante]]\n| presenter = {{plainlist|\n* [[Joey de Leon]]\n* [[Ryan Yllana]]}}\n| country = [[Philippines]]\n| location = Philippines\n| language = [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]]\n| network = {{plainlist|\n* [[Intercontinental Broadcasting Corporation|IBC]]\n* [[Q (TV network)|Q]]\n* [[GMA Network]]}}\n| company = GMA Entertainment TV\n| camera = [[Multiple-camera setup]]\n| first_aired = October 1990 (IBC) - October 2007\n| last_aired = April 2008\n}}\n\n{{PHL}} - It was first shown on the [[Intercontinental Broadcasting Corporation]] TV network in October 1990 as a [[Filipino language|Filipino]]-dubbed show. Later episodes contained interludes shot on a studio with actors [[Anjo Yllana]] as Takesh and [[Smokey Manoloto]] as \"Iwakura\" providing the commentary with a gravelly Japanese accent, which was later dropped in favor of their natural voices. The Filipino production crew also developed on their relationship, with Iwakura often trying to trick Takeshi on several occasions. One episode which resulted in the contestants' victory was even written as Takeshi's worst [[nightmare]]; when Iwakura finally wakes him up, Takeshi is so [[Psychological trauma|traumatized]] that he asks to call off a scheduled taping. Makers of the malt drink brand [[Ovaltine]] created an in-show mini contest as part of a product endorsement deal in 1991. In this version, the names given to most of the challenges are translated from their original Japanese such as \"Devil's Maze\" for the Honeycomb and Square Mazes, \"Flying Mushroom\" for Mushroom Trip, and \"Sumo Wrestling\" for Sumo Rings.\n\nThe IBC episodes of Takeshi's Castle were later rerun on [[Southern Broadcasting Network|SBN]] during 1993 and 1994. The show was not edited as before at IBC.\n\n''Takeshi's Castle'' enjoyed a revival in the Philippines in 2006. This time around, comedians [[Joey de Leon]] and [[Ryan Yllana]] (Anjo's younger brother) provide the commentary as fictional characters shogun Shintaro \"Taru\" Gokoyami who is Takeshi's right-hand man and sumo wrestler Kakawate Takehome, the leader of the Takeshi Gundan, fictional in the sense that there are no such characters in the original cast. Initially, the two provide play-by-play commentary, but they as well as some added characters reduced themselves to skits and commentary in between clips of the show. Later, as part of Q's first anniversary, Anjo finally appeared alongside the new cast, reprising his role as \"prince\" Takeshi.\nDue to Takeshi's Castle's competitive ratings, the management of GMA Network (which produces shows for its sister network Q) decided to move the show from its original station in an evening slot, now to the early afternoon weekend slot of GMA. Takeshi's Castle is aired on a weekly basis as opposed to the weekdays airing on Q, and is aired before Eat Bulaga on Saturdays and before SOP on Sundays. This is done to increase and improve the ratings of the succeeding shows. ''Takeshi's Castle'' started to air on GMA on December 23, 2006 with same hosts. The show aired on its last episode on May 9, 2007, and after a long break of TV experience, Joey and Ryan assumed new personalities as Master GT (later Tirso Potter) and Captain B respectively. It was temporarily replaced by \"[[Just Joking]]\" which starred also Joey De Leon and Ryan Yllana and other casts. On August 15, 2007, \"Takeshi's Castle\" returned on air once again with all new episodes and Mike \"Pekto\" Nacua (Cookie), John Feir (Belli) and Love A\u00f1over (replacement when either Cookie or Belli was not in) become commentators. The show aired at Saturdays 11:30&nbsp;a.m. before \"[[Eat Bulaga!]]\", and Sundays 11:15&nbsp;a.m. before [[SOP (Philippine TV series)|SOP Rules]].\nOn GMA's regional networks, a [[Cebuano language|Cebuano]]-dubbed show now on [[DYSS-TV|GMA Cebu]] & [[DXMJ-TV|Davao]] from Saturdays and Sundays in the Morning by Cebuano version from title called '''Takeshi's Castle Wala Gyud sa Isaysay Banzai!''' (Never Say Banzai!).\n\n===Portugal===\n{{POR}} &mdash; A version called '''Nunca Digas Banzai''' (Portuguese for \"Never Say Banzai\", based on the Italian name for it, '''Mai Dire Banzai''') aired on [[Sociedade Independente de Comunica\u00e7\u00e3o|SIC]] starting in 1994, where it reached some popularity.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} Voiceovers were provided by two hosts, [[Jos\u00e9 Carlos Malato]] and Jo\u00e3o Carlos Vaz. Takeshi and Ishikura were renamed \"Fujimoto\" and \"Fujicarro\" (a play on the Portuguese words for \"[motor]bike\" and \"car\" using the Japanese word [[wikt:fuji|Fuji]]), and the Portuguese hosts made no attempt to interpret the reality of the show, instead using the contestants as surrogates for the satirical comments about Portuguese public figures, in a similar style to MXC.\n\n===Russia===\n{{RUS}} - The series were featured in [[Ren TV]] project show \"The Best Shows of the World\" (\u041b\u0443\u0447\u0448\u0438\u0435 \u0448\u043e\u0443 \u043c\u0438\u0440\u0430) in the early 2000s and due to positive public reaction were aired on the regular basis on its own, named \"Takeshi Kitano's Castle\" (\u0417\u0430\u043c\u043e\u043a \u0422\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0448\u0438 \u041a\u0438\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043e).

The format of the show is the translated commentary version of UK adaptation.\n\n===Serbia===\n{{SRB}} - Show started with showing on FOX TV in January 2010 named ''Take\u0161i''.\n\n===Singapore===\n\n{{SGP}} - The show first debut in the early-1990s on Singapore's free-to-air channel, Channel 8, as \"100 Wars\" ({{zh|\u767e\u6230\u767e\u52dd}}), as the program was acquired from Taiwan. In the mid 1990s till early 2000's, re-runs of the show aired on Saturdays at 1.30 pm in the afternoon, following the News on Channel 8.\n\n===Slovakia===\n{{SVK}} &mdash; During the 2011-2012 was [https://web.archive.org/web/20120713005200/http://www.joj.sk/takesiho-hrad/takesiho-hrad-o-relacii.html Take\u0161iho hrad] ([[Slovak language|Slovak]]) broadcast on channel [http://plus.joj.sk/ Joj Plus] with a single-voice Slovak comment.\n\n===South Africa===\n{{RSA}}\n\u2014\nThe show was broadcast daily on the Sony MAX channel, Channel 128 on [[DStv]]. It was the condensed version of the original series with commentary provided by Craig Charles. It began broadcasting in 2009 and was a huge hit with viewers. Due to its popularity the show has been aired to a broader audience on [[South African Broadcasting Corporation|SABC]] 2.\n\n===Spain===\n{{ESP}} &mdash; The program aired in the 1990s as '''Humor Amarillo''' (when translated it means \"Yellow Humour\" or \"Yellow Comedy\") on TV channel [[Telecinco]]. Comedians Juan Herrera and [[Miguel \u00c1ngel Coll]] (son of [[Jos\u00e9 Luis Coll]]) commented on the images; this version of the show has achieved cult status and there are some fansites and web petitions for returns. In fact, the Spanish version created some terms now familiar to either ''Takeshi's Castle'' or ''Humor Amarillo'', like \"El Laberinto del Chinotauro\" (literally ''The Chinesetaur Labyrinth'', name for any of the maze challenges), \"Los ca\u00f1ones de Nakasone\" (parody of \"Guns of Navarone\" Spanish title), \"Las Zamburguesas\" (for Skipping Stones),\"Gacela Thompson\" (\"Thompson Gazelle\"), a pathetic businessman character, and \"Chino Cudeiro\" (The Chinese Cudeiro, as the name started to be assigned when appeared a player with a red T-shirt with the inscription \"Cudeiro, Galicia, Espa\u00f1a\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://los80.lacoctelera.net/post/2005/11/25/humor-amarillo |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-07 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140107164658/http://los80.lacoctelera.net/post/2005/11/25/humor-amarillo |archivedate=2014-01-07}}</ref>), the name assigned to a random player that always \"dies\", one of the most popular characters in Spain. On January 28, 2006, a second version dubbed by [[Fernando Costilla]] and [[Paco Bravo]] premiered on Spanish TV channel [[Cuatro (TV channel)|Cuatro]]. They have shown every one of the original Japanese episodes, with the last one being shown on June 9, 2007, ending with a special message by the Spanish commentators.\nThe 2006 version is currently being rebroadcast on the [[Telecinco]]-owned channel [[Energy (TV channel)|Energy]].\n\nThese two versions had in common that it was naturally assumed that the dubbing was completely unrelated to the original dialogues, to the point that sometimes the references to the actual contest were really few. The commentators could turn the contestants into mushroom seekers, or people looking for a new apartment. Alongside the spectacular hits suffered by the contestants and the show's peculiar aesthetic, this helped boost its popularity.\n\n===Taiwan===\n{{TWN}} &mdash; A gameshow called ''100 Wars, 100 Victories'' ({{zh|\u767e\u6230\u767e\u52dd}})  on [[Chinese Television System|CTS]] was formed from the original show, similar to how ''MXC Almost Live'' was formed.\n\n===Thailand===\n{{THA}} &mdash; Takeshi's Castle was dubbed and shown on Channel 5 in 1988 - 1995. The title was changed to \"Hod, Mun, Ha\" (\u0e42\u0e2b\u0e14 \u0e21\u0e31\u0e19 \u0e2e\u0e32), or \"Cruel, Thrilling, Fun\".\n\nIn 2007, the unedited original series with bilingual soundtrack (Thai & Japanese) was aired on X-ZYTE channel on [[TrueVisions]] cable TV every Sunday and rerun several times throughout a week.\n\nIn 2014, [[Channel 7 (Thailand)]] bought the rights to remake the show. \"\u0e42\u0e2b\u0e14 \u0e21\u0e31\u0e19 \u0e2e\u0e32 Takeshi's Castle Thailand\" first aired on 20 July, with a new episode airing most Sundays. The show's format is identical to the one used in the original show, but with a few minor changes. Shogun Takeshi (Note Chernyim) has kept Princess Woosenko (Woonsen Virithipa Pakdeeprasong) as a prisoner in his castle. General Shahkrit (Shahkrit Yamnarm) attempts to rescue the princess from the castle by sending his army of contestants through Shogun's challenges (remade challenges include Slippery Wall, Avalanche, Honeycomb Maze, Skipping Stones, Slip Way, Sumo Rings, Wet Paint, and Tug Of War), and the last remaining contestants battle against Shogun's guards in the Showdown. Any winners receive the 1,000,000 Thai-baht cash prize, the cash prize is rolled over to the next episode if there are no winners\n\nLater on, the show reduced the number of competitors to 20, and then 12 in current shows. With the rules format changing, the competitors don't get eliminated throughout the show, but instead work as a team. The competitors are given, by Shogun Takeshi, 10 carts and the Shogun has no guard carts at the beginning of the episode. The competitors then play 5 challenges before the Showdown. In the first challenge, usually involved all the competitors playing at the same time, every single competitors must pass the challenge, while the subsequent challenges needs at most 5 passes in order to be credited as a win. Winning a challenge will cause the situation remaining unchanged, while losing the first challenge takes one cart away from the competitors team and one cart added to Shogun's team in Showdown. In subsequent challenges, one car is taken away and added to Shogun's team if less than 5 competitors passed, two cars are taken if less than 3 competitors passed. In current shows, with 12 competitors, two cars are taken away if less than 3 competitors passed, while 3 passes are credit with a win, and no cars are taken away. Losing a challenge also results in a punishment for the competitors in various ways, usually messy and painful. In Showdown, the team sends out two competitors per one cart they have to battle with Shogun's guards. Succeeding in Battle awards all competitors a share of 5,000,000 baht cash prize, but the prize is remain the same in all episodes.\n\n===Ukraine===\n{{UKR}} \u2014 Show was translated and aired on [[QTV (Ukraine)|QTV]] channel as \u00abLaughter with Takeshi Kitano\u00bb (\u0420\u0435\u0433\u043e\u0442\u043d\u044f \u0437 \u0422\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0448\u0456 \u041a\u0456\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043e) during 2008-2010.\n\n===United Kingdom===\n{{Infobox television |\n|show_name = '''Takeshi's Castle'''\n|image = [[File:Takeshi's Castel Comedy.jpg|220 px]]\n|picture_format = [[576i]] ([[Aspect ratio (image)#4:3|4:3]] [[Standard-definition television|SDTV]])\n|runtime = 30 minutes<br>60 minutes (specials)\n|creator = Tokyo Broadcasting System\n|writer = Ben Mole <br> Craig Charles <br> Alex Mole <br> Frederick Hutton Mills\n|editor = Anna Skidmore <br> Eion Martin <br> Duncan Armstrong <br> Colm O'Rourke <br> Andrew Trussler\n|director =\n|executive_producer = Ben Mole (2002\u20132004) <br> Sophie Hodgkins (2013)\n|starring =\n|narrated = [[Craig Charles]] (2002\u20132004)<br>[[Dick & Dom]] (2013)<br>[[Jonathan Ross]] (2017\u20132018) <br>[[Roman Kemp]] (2018) <br>[[Guz Khan]] (2019-)\n|country = {{flag|United Kingdom}}\n|language = English\n|network = [[Challenge (TV channel)|Challenge]] (2002\u20132004, 2013)<br>[[Comedy Central (UK and Ireland)|Comedy Central]] (2017\u2013)\n|company = [[Living TV Group|Flextech]]/Black Mole Films (2002\u20132004)<br>[[BSkyB|Sky]]/TBS (2013)\n|first_aired = '''Original series'''<br> 9 November 2002\u20131 January 2004 <br> '''First revived series''' <br> 8\u201329 March 2013 <br> '''Second revived series''' <br> 26 October 2017\u2013present \n|num_episodes = '''Original series''' <br> 145 (inc. 10 Specials and 13 Best Ofs) <br> '''First revived series''' <br> 6\n|list_episodes =\n|theme_music_composer = Jonathan Czerwik\n|opentheme = \"Takeshi's Castle\" <br> by Jonathan Czerwik\n|endtheme = \"Takeshi's Castle\" Shortened Instrumental\n|preceded_by =\n|followed_by =\n|website = http://www.challenge.co.uk/takeshis-castle/\n}}\n\n{{UK}} &mdash; The show was first introduced to British audiences in the late 1980s, when it was featured semi-regularly as part of LWT's ''[[...on Television|Tarrant on TV]]'', in which broadcaster [[Chris Tarrant]] showcased a variety of unusual television programmes from around the world. One of the series' previous hosts, [[Clive James]], appeared in an original Japanese episode as an international contestant - with behind the scenes footage shown as part of his two-part ITV documentary ''...in Japan'' in 1987.\n\n''Takeshi's Castle'' would become more well-known later when a condensed version of the original series proved an unexpected hit when it premiered on Challenge on 9 November 2002, regularly dominating the top ten programmes on the channel each week.\n\nThe UK format did not follow the original Japanese format - instead presenting each sequence of games as comic martial challenges leading to the final game wherein contestants not so far eliminated try to storm Takeshi's Castle. Each episode in the original run was narrated by [[Craig Charles]], who also coined the term \"Keshi Heads\" to describe avid fans of the show. A typical episode of the UK format of Takeshi's Castle has about eight games, followed by the final Showdown. After each event, a 'Ridiculous Replay' is shown, highlighting the most entertaining attempt. Challenge decided to edit out the comedy sketches between Takeshi and Higashi to allow more (or fewer) games to be shown during the half-hour block.\n\nMore series were commissioned and shown over the next few months, culminating in a series of hour-long specials in the Autumn of 2003, and a special highlights show, ''The A-Z of Takeshi's Castle'', broadcast on January 1, 2004 which showed some of the best clips of the best games as the last original series finale. Repeats still air regularly to this day on [[Challenge (TV channel)|Challenge]], with an average of 130,000 viewers an episode. On 3 September 2005, ''MXC'' aired for the first time in the UK on Challenge.\n\nOn 9 May 2007, ''[[The Paul O'Grady Show]]'' had their own mini ''Takeshi's Castle'' challenge, including 'Knock Knock', 'Bite the Bun', a \"Bridge Ball\" adaptation called 'Balancing Act' and the 'Slippery Wall'. The UK TV series returned to Challenge after a hiatus on 7 September 2009 with a modified opening sequence (to fit with Flextech rebranding to [[Living TV Group|Virgin Media Television]]).\n\nIn February 2010, a [http://www.keshiheads.co.uk/takeshi2012.html campaign] was launched by fansite [http://www.keshiheads.co.uk Keshi Heads] in an attempt to bring a brand new series of ''Takeshi's Castle'' to Challenge within its 10th anniversary year on the channel (November 2012-13). It was suggested by campaigners that these new episodes would feature never-before-seen games (previously completely cut from other episodes), and feature five Japanese episodes new to the UK, including the Pilot and an International Special which have never been seen on TV since their original airings in Japan.\n\nOn 13 December 2012, [https://twitter.com/ChallengeTV/status/279182737548664832 Challenge announced] that they had signed a deal for \"unseen bits of Takeshi's Castle\". The new series, named ''Takeshi's Castle Rebooted'', which aired from 8 to 29 March 2013, featured games and episodes suggested by the Keshi Heads website in their campaign. Despite Craig Charles [https://twitter.com/CCfunkandsoul/status/302811280010514433 agreeing to return for the new series], Challenge brought in [[Richard McCourt]] and [[Dominic Wood]] ([[Dick and Dom]]) as the new voiceovers. Hayato Tani also filmed presentation links for the new series.\n\n''Rebooted'' disappointed fans, with many complaining about Charles' replacement as voiceover.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} Challenge reportedly received more negative comments about ''Rebooted'', on their social media accounts, than any other show in the channel's history, with the series never once reaching its weekly top ten ratings.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} The original episodes returned to Challenge after ''Rebooted'' ended its run. In contrast to the newly produced series, these entered the weekly top ten rating shows almost instantly upon their return. ''Rebooted'' has since been repeated in off-peak timeslots.\n\nA new series of ''Takeshi's Castle'' aired on [[Comedy Central (UK and Ireland)|Comedy Central]], with [[Jonathan Ross]] as voiceover.<ref>\"[http://www.digitalspy.com/tv/news/a839650/takeshis-castle-returning-without-craig-charles/ Takeshi's Castle is returning to UK television, but Craig Charles will be replaced as commentator]\", Digital Spy</ref> This version used footage from the Thailand series.

The show has been broadcast in Canada, Australia and New Zealand.\n\nTwo attempts were made to Americanize the format:\n\n*On July 28, 1990, [[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX]] aired a special half-hour version of the original show premise entitled ''King of the Mountain'' which was packaged by Fox Square Productions and was hosted by John Mulrooney and Judy Toll. This version used the same games, but had only 10 competitors and no costumed characters to impede the players' progress. This American attempt only taped two episodes on July 24, 1988, and only one aired. Footage from the show was also used on episode 106 of Takeshi's Castle.\n*On June 16, 1993, [[CBS]] aired the second attempt, entitled ''Storm the Castle''. This hour-long version, which was packaged by [[Vin Di Bona]] Productions and hosted by [[Michael Burger]] and [[Nely Gal\u00e1n]], pitted 30 families against each other and against well-known [[monster]]s (such as [[Beetlejuice]]) in a quest to win $15,000. Unlike ''Mountain'', ''Storm'' had a few exclusive games not seen anywhere else. ''Storm'', like ''Mountain'', only lasted a single episode. The show was notable as future NFL player [[Christian Fauria]] appeared with his family.\n\n===Vietnam===\n{{VIE}} - The Vietnamese show ''\u0110\u1ea1i N\u00e1o Th\u00e0nh Takeshi'' produced under license, with the first episode airing March 25, 2017 in prime time on [[Vietnam Television|VTV3]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vtv.vn/truyen-hinh/gameshow-dai-nao-thanh-takeshi-chinh-thuc-ra-mat-khan-gia-20170324112007781.htm|title=Gameshow \u0110\u1ea1i n\u00e1o th\u00e0nh Takeshi ch\u00ednh th\u1ee9c ra m\u1eaft kh\u00e1n gi\u1ea3|publisher=Vietnam Television|accessdate=25 March 2017}}</ref> The program features famous Vietnamese artists, with warlords Takeshi played by Tr\u1ea5n Th\u00e0nh and Sharkito by Tr\u01b0\u01a1ng Th\u1ebf Vinh, and Princess Woonsenko played by Di\u1ec5m My 9X.

The Show Down in front of the castle takes place in boats equipped with water spray nozzle weapons and paper disc targets.\n\n==In other media==\n*A [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Famicom]] game with the same name was released in 1987 by [[Bandai]].
