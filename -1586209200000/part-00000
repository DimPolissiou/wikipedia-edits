Turkey's association with the United States began in 1947 when the [[United States Congress]] designated Turkey, under the provisions of the \"Truman Doctrine\", as the recipient of special economic and military assistance intended to help it resist threats from the [[Soviet Union]]. In support of overall United States Cold War strategy, Turkey contributed personnel to the United Nations forces in the [[Korean War]] (1950\u201353), joined NATO in 1952.

As the Turkish government would not submit to the Soviet Union's requests, tensions arose in the region, leading to a show of naval force on the side of the Soviets. Since British assistance to Turkey had ended in 1947, the U.S. dispatched military aid to ensure that Turkey would retain chief control of the passage.

In response to the failed [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]] of 1961 and the presence of American [[PGM-19 Jupiter|Jupiter ballistic missiles]] in Italy and Turkey, Soviet leader [[Nikita Khrushchev]] agreed to Cuba's request to place nuclear missiles on the island to deter a future invasion. An agreement was reached between [[John F. Kennedy]] and Khrushchev. Publicly, the Soviets would dismantle their offensive weapons in Cuba, in exchange for a US public declaration and agreement to avoid invading Cuba again. Secretly, the United States agreed that it would dismantle all US-built [[PGM-19 Jupiter|Jupiter MRBMs]], which had been deployed in Turkey against the Soviet Union.\n\nIn 2017, in [[The Putin Interviews|\"The Putin interviews\"]] claimed that the placement of Russian missiles in Cuba was a Russian reaction to the earlier stationing of American missiles in Turkey in 1961\u201362.

The [[EOKA|National Organisation of Cypriot Fighters]] (EOKA), a [[Greek Cypriot]] right-wing nationalist [[guerrilla]] organisation, began an armed campaign in support of the end of [[United Kingdom|British]] colonial rule and the [[Enosis|unification of Cyprus and Greece]] (''Enosis'') in 1955. Opposition to ''Enosis'' from [[Turkish Cypriot]]s led to the formation of the [[Turkish Resistance Organisation]] (TMT) in support of the [[Taksim (politics)|partition of Cyprus]]. In the mid-1960s relations worsened between Greek and Turkish communities on Cyprus. Britain wanted to hand the crisis and a peacekeeping role to either NATO or UN forces. [[Presidency of Lyndon B. Johnson|US President Lyndon B. Johnson]] tried to prevent either a Greek or Turkish invasion of Cyprus and war between them. American diplomat [[George Ball (diplomat)|George Ball]] found [[Makarios III|Archbishop Makarios]], president of Cyprus, difficult to deal with. He took a hard-line and rejected advice.\n\nThe Americans secretly talked to General [[Georgios Grivas]], leader of the [[EOKA]] guerrilla organisation. Invasion and war did not happen then, but the U.S. alienated both the Greek and the Turkish governments and had driven Makarios closer to the Russians and Egyptians.<ref>H. W.

In doing so, Turkey claimed to protect the safety of Turkish Cypriots under the [[Treaty of Guarantee (1960)|Treaty of Guarantee]]. As a result of the military operation, Turkish forces took control of the northern third of Cyprus and divided the island along what became known as the [[Green Line (Cyprus)|Green Line]] monitored by the United Nations.\n\nTurkey, only 75&nbsp;km away, had repeatedly claimed, for decades before the invasion and frequently afterwards, that Cyprus was of vital strategic importance to it. Ankara has defied a host of UN resolutions demanding the withdrawal of its occupation troops from the island. About 142,000 Greek Cypriots living in the north \u2013 nearly one quarter of the population of Cyprus \u2013 were forcibly expelled from the occupied northern part of the island where they constituted 80% of the population.

It was in this period that the [[Turkish Aerospace Industries]] (TAI) was established and started to build [[F-16 Fighting Falcon]] jets under licence in Turkey. Washington also demonstrated its support of \u00d6zal's market-oriented economic policies and efforts to open the Turkish economy to international trade by pushing for acceptance of an [[International Monetary Fund]] program to provide economic assistance to Turkey. Furthermore, the United States, unlike [[Europe]]an countries, did not persistently and publicly criticize Turkey over allegations of [[human rights violations]].

President \u00d6zal believed Turkey's future security depended on the continuation of a strong relationship with the United States.\n\nThe Gulf War [President \u00d6zal] modified the main principles of Turkish foreign policy towards the Middle East, which were non-interference in intra-Arab disputes and the Middle Eastern affairs. The role Turkey played during Gulf War showed to the public that it was one of the key actors in the region. For the specialists, Turkey was already recognized because of the issues of water, and the Kurdish question.<ref>Karaosmanoglu, A.

Turkey's economic ties to Iraq were extensive and their disruption hurt the country. Turkey lost approximately $60 billion by closing [[Kirkuk\u2013Ceyhan Oil Pipeline]] during the conflict. At the run-up to the war Chief of the Turkish General Staff General [[Necip Torumtay]] resigned out of disagreement in involvement of Turkish ground forces to the conflict.<ref name=\"Michael Robert Hickok 2000\"/> This prevented Turkey's active military engagement.  Turkey allowed United Nations forces ([[United Nations Security Council Resolution 665|UN SC Resolution 665]]) to fly missions from its air bases. In so doing, Turkey remained a platform for the US attacks against Iraq for the rest of the conflict. Turkey played a role in the war by tying down a sizeable proportion of the Iraqi army on the [[Turkey\u2013Iraq border]].\n\nAfter the war, Turkey continued to support major United States initiatives in the region, including the creation of a safe zone for the Iraqi Kurds over northern Iraq. [[Turkey's migrant crisis#Influx from Gulf War|Turkey received heavy Iraqi Kurdish refugees]] following [[1991 uprisings in Iraq]] (1 March \u2013 5 April 1991). The [[Iraqi no-fly zones]] were two no-fly zones (NFZs) that were proclaimed by the United States, United Kingdom, and France to create safe zones for the internally displaced people after the war. The US and UK claimed authorization for the NFZ based on [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 688]], though not in the text. The United States stated that the NFZs were intended to protect the ethnic Kurdish minority in northern Iraq and Shiite Muslims in the south. Turkey opened its Incirlik and Diyarbakir air bases and involved in the ground support and intelligence operations for the northern NFZ which was initially part of [[Operation Provide Comfort]] relief operations which was followed on by [[Operation Northern Watch]].\n\nNFZs also enabled a safe heaven for PKK. Turkey performed cross-border operations into northern Iraq between 12 October and 1 November 1992 [[Operation Northern Iraq]], between 20 March and 4 May 1995 [[Operation Steel]], between 12 May and 7 July 1997 [[Operation Hammer (1997)|Operation Hammer]], between 25 September and 15 October 1997 [[Operation Dawn (1997)|Operation Dawn]]. In September 1998, [[Massoud Barzani|Barzani]] and [[Jalal Talabani|Talabani]] signed the U.S.-mediated Washington Agreement establishing a formal peace treaty. In the agreement, the parties agreed to share revenue, share power, and deny the use of northern Iraq to the PKK.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thewashingtoninstitute.org/templateC05.php?CID=1219 |title=Kurdish Agreement Signals New U.S. Commitment |publisher=The Washington Institute for Near East Policy |date=29 September 1998 |accessdate=28 January 2013}}</ref> President [[Bill Clinton]] signed the [[Iraq Liberation Act]] into law, providing for military assistance to Iraqi opposition groups, including the PUK and KDP.\n\nThe United States' use of Turkish military installations during the bombing of Iraq in 1991 led to antiwar demonstrations in several Turkish cities, and sporadic attacks on United States facilities continued in 1992 and 1993.\n\n===Clinton administration (1993\u20132001)===\nNevertheless, among Turkey's political elite, a consensus had emerged by January 1995 that Turkey's security depended on remaining a [[Strategic alliance|strategic ally]] of the United States.

Turkey's association with the United States began in 1947 when the [[United States Congress]] designated Turkey, under the provisions of the \"Truman Doctrine\", as the recipient of special economic and military assistance intended to help it resist threats from the [[Soviet Union]]. In support of overall United States Cold War strategy, Turkey contributed personnel to the United Nations forces in the [[Korean War]] (1950\u201353), joined NATO in 1952.

As the Turkish government would not submit to the Soviet Union's requests, tensions arose in the region, leading to a show of naval force on the side of the Soviets. Since British assistance to Turkey had ended in 1947, the U.S. dispatched military aid to ensure that Turkey would retain chief control of the passage.

In response to the failed [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]] of 1961 and the presence of American [[PGM-19 Jupiter|Jupiter ballistic missiles]] in Italy and Turkey, Soviet leader [[Nikita Khrushchev]] agreed to Cuba's request to place nuclear missiles on the island to deter a future invasion. An agreement was reached between [[John F. Kennedy]] and Khrushchev. Publicly, the Soviets would dismantle their offensive weapons in Cuba, in exchange for a US public declaration and agreement to avoid invading Cuba again. Secretly, the United States agreed that it would dismantle all US-built [[PGM-19 Jupiter|Jupiter MRBMs]], which had been deployed in Turkey against the Soviet Union.\n\nIn 2017, in [[The Putin Interviews|\"The Putin interviews\"]] claimed that the placement of Russian missiles in Cuba was a Russian reaction to the earlier stationing of American missiles in Turkey in 1961\u201362.

The [[EOKA|National Organisation of Cypriot Fighters]] (EOKA), a [[Greek Cypriot]] right-wing nationalist [[guerrilla]] organisation, began an armed campaign in support of the end of [[United Kingdom|British]] colonial rule and the [[Enosis|unification of Cyprus and Greece]] (''Enosis'') in 1955. Opposition to ''Enosis'' from [[Turkish Cypriot]]s led to the formation of the [[Turkish Resistance Organisation]] (TMT) in support of the [[Taksim (politics)|partition of Cyprus]]. In the mid-1960s relations worsened between Greek and Turkish communities on Cyprus. Britain wanted to hand the crisis and a peacekeeping role to either NATO or UN forces. [[Presidency of Lyndon B. Johnson|US President Lyndon B. Johnson]] tried to prevent either a Greek or Turkish invasion of Cyprus and war between them. American diplomat [[George Ball (diplomat)|George Ball]] found [[Makarios III|Archbishop Makarios]], president of Cyprus, difficult to deal with. He took a hard-line and rejected advice.\n\nThe Americans secretly talked to General [[Georgios Grivas]], leader of the [[EOKA]] guerrilla organisation. Invasion and war did not happen then, but the U.S. alienated both the Greek and the Turkish governments and had driven Makarios closer to the Russians and Egyptians.<ref>H. W.

In doing so, Turkey claimed to protect the safety of Turkish Cypriots under the [[Treaty of Guarantee (1960)|Treaty of Guarantee]]. As a result of the military operation, Turkish forces took control of the northern third of Cyprus and divided the island along what became known as the [[Green Line (Cyprus)|Green Line]] monitored by the United Nations.\n\nTurkey, only 75&nbsp;km away, had repeatedly claimed, for decades before the invasion and frequently afterwards, that Cyprus was of vital strategic importance to it. Ankara has defied a host of UN resolutions demanding the withdrawal of its occupation troops from the island. About 142,000 Greek Cypriots living in the north \u2013 nearly one quarter of the population of Cyprus \u2013 were forcibly expelled from the occupied northern part of the island where they constituted 80% of the population.

It was in this period that the [[Turkish Aerospace Industries]] (TAI) was established and started to build [[F-16 Fighting Falcon]] jets under licence in Turkey. Washington also demonstrated its support of \u00d6zal's market-oriented economic policies and efforts to open the Turkish economy to international trade by pushing for acceptance of an [[International Monetary Fund]] program to provide economic assistance to Turkey. Furthermore, the United States, unlike [[Europe]]an countries, did not persistently and publicly criticize Turkey over allegations of [[human rights violations]].

President \u00d6zal believed Turkey's future security depended on the continuation of a strong relationship with the United States.\n\nThe Gulf War [President \u00d6zal] modified the main principles of Turkish foreign policy towards the Middle East, which were non-interference in intra-Arab disputes and the Middle Eastern affairs. The role Turkey played during Gulf War showed to the public that it was one of the key actors in the region. For the specialists, Turkey was already recognized because of the issues of water, and the Kurdish question.<ref>Karaosmanoglu, A.

Turkey's economic ties to Iraq were extensive and their disruption hurt the country. Turkey lost approximately $60 billion by closing [[Kirkuk\u2013Ceyhan Oil Pipeline]] during the conflict. At the run-up to the war Chief of the Turkish General Staff General [[Necip Torumtay]] resigned out of disagreement in involvement of Turkish ground forces to the conflict.<ref name=\"Michael Robert Hickok 2000\"/> This prevented Turkey's active military engagement.  Turkey allowed United Nations forces ([[United Nations Security Council Resolution 665|UN SC Resolution 665]]) to fly missions from its air bases. In so doing, Turkey remained a platform for the US attacks against Iraq for the rest of the conflict. Turkey played a role in the war by tying down a sizeable proportion of the Iraqi army on the [[Turkey\u2013Iraq border]].\n\nAfter the war, Turkey continued to support major United States initiatives in the region, including the creation of a safe zone for the Iraqi Kurds over northern Iraq. [[Turkey's migrant crisis#Influx from Gulf War|Turkey received heavy Iraqi Kurdish refugees]] following [[1991 uprisings in Iraq]] (1 March \u2013 5 April 1991). The [[Iraqi no-fly zones]] were two no-fly zones (NFZs) that were proclaimed by the United States, United Kingdom, and France to create safe zones for the internally displaced people after the war. The US and UK claimed authorization for the NFZ based on [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 688]], though not in the text. The United States stated that the NFZs were intended to protect the ethnic Kurdish minority in northern Iraq and Shiite Muslims in the south. Turkey opened its Incirlik and Diyarbakir air bases and involved in the ground support and intelligence operations for the northern NFZ which was initially part of [[Operation Provide Comfort]] relief operations which was followed on by [[Operation Northern Watch]].\n\nNFZs also enabled a safe heaven for PKK. Turkey performed cross-border operations into northern Iraq between 12 October and 1 November 1992 [[Operation Northern Iraq]], between 20 March and 4 May 1995 [[Operation Steel]], between 12 May and 7 July 1997 [[Operation Hammer (1997)|Operation Hammer]], between 25 September and 15 October 1997 [[Operation Dawn (1997)|Operation Dawn]]. In September 1998, [[Massoud Barzani|Barzani]] and [[Jalal Talabani|Talabani]] signed the U.S.-mediated Washington Agreement establishing a formal peace treaty. In the agreement, the parties agreed to share revenue, share power, and deny the use of northern Iraq to the PKK.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thewashingtoninstitute.org/templateC05.php?CID=1219 |title=Kurdish Agreement Signals New U.S. Commitment |publisher=The Washington Institute for Near East Policy |date=29 September 1998 |accessdate=28 January 2013}}</ref> President [[Bill Clinton]] signed the [[Iraq Liberation Act]] into law, providing for military assistance to Iraqi opposition groups, including the PUK and KDP.\n\nThe United States' use of Turkish military installations during the bombing of Iraq in 1991 led to antiwar demonstrations in several Turkish cities, and sporadic attacks on United States facilities continued in 1992 and 1993.\n\n===Clinton administration (1993\u20132001)===\nNevertheless, among Turkey's political elite, a consensus had emerged by January 1995 that Turkey's security depended on remaining a [[Strategic alliance|strategic ally]] of the United States.

The team's first home was [[Tampa Stadium]], which had recently been expanded to seat just over 72,000 fans.\n\n==John McKay and early frustration (1976 to 1978)==\nThe Buccaneers joined the [[National Football League|NFL]] as members of the [[AFC West]] in 1976. The following year, they were moved to the [[NFC Central]], while the other 1976 expansion team, the [[Seattle Seahawks]], switched conferences with Tampa Bay and joined the AFC West. This realignment was dictated by the league as part of the 1976 expansion plan, so that both teams could play each other twice and every other NFL franchise once during their first two seasons.\n\nLongtime [[USC Trojans football|USC]] coach [[John McKay (football coach)|John McKay]] was recruited as the team's first head coach. McKay had never been a fan of the NFL and turned down three previous offers for a coaching position, but was finally convinced after being offered a $3 million contract and the challenge of building a new team from scratch. He stressed a five-year plan that relied on veteran players, quality draft picks, and patience. However, [[1976 NFL Expansion Draft|the expansion draft]] prior to the entrance of the Bucs and Seahawks into the league was not as generous as it would become for later NFL expansion teams, so the Buccaneers were saddled with aging veterans and castoffs from other teams. Despite McKay's coaching, the Bucs often appeared incompetent, with missed tackles, fumbled snaps, and a frustrating inability to score, and the patience of fans and local media soon wore thin. McKay was also criticized for relying too much on the USC playbook\u2014for example, the \u201cstudent body right\u201d rushing play\u2014not to mention choosing [[running back]] [[Ricky Bell (running back)|Ricky Bell]] over future NFL Hall of Famer [[Tony Dorsett]] in the [[1977 NFL Draft]].\n\nThis frustration, and even anger, that Buccaneer fans targeted at McKay \u2013 which prompted the brief popularity of bumper stickers that proclaimed \u201cThrow McKay in the Bay\u201d \u2013 stemmed from the team's notorious 26-game regular season losing streak, including a then-record 0\u201314 season (a record since broken by [[2008 Detroit Lions season|the 2008 Detroit Lions]] and [[2017 Cleveland Browns season|2017 Cleveland Browns]] who each finished 0\u201316). [[1976 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|The 1976 Bucs]] are widely considered one of the worst NFL teams of all time. They were shut out five times and scored only 125 points the entire season, an average of nine per game, while giving up 412. The Buccaneers suffered so many injuries that they were forced to hire players off the street and from the [[Canadian Football League|CFL]]. The team became the butt of many jokes, especially from [[Johnny Carson]] on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson|The Tonight Show]]'', but also from fans themselves, who late into the 1977 season, wore bags on their heads and encouraged the team to \u201cgo for 0\u201d, as in zero wins. After a particularly dismal effort during the streak, coach McKay gave perhaps the quintessential comment on the team's plight. In a post-game press conference, ''[[Tampa Tribune]]'' sports editor [[Tom McEwen (sportswriter)|Tom McEwen]] asked McKay about the execution of his team's offensive line. McKay responded,{{cquote|I\u2019m in favor of it.}}Another choice quotation that summed up his frustration at the time:{{cquote|We can\u2019t win at home, we can\u2019t win on the road, so we were going to petition the league for a neutral site.}}\n\n[[1977 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|The 1977 season]] started even worse as the Buccaneers were shut out six times. In Week 13 the Bucs finally managed to win their first regular-season game (the team had beaten [[1976 Atlanta Falcons season|the Atlanta Falcons]] 17\u20133 in a 1976 pre-season game), defeating [[1977 New Orleans Saints season|the New Orleans Saints]] on the road 33\u201314. The win was highlighted by three [[interception]]s returned for touchdowns, an NFL record at the time. (The team would later equal this feat 25 years later when they defeated [[2002 Oakland Raiders season|the Oakland Raiders]] in [[Super Bowl XXXVII]].) Saints QB [[Archie Manning]] had said that it would be a disgrace to lose to Tampa Bay, and after the game was over the Buccaneers players taunted him by chanting \u201cIt\u2019s disgraceful!\u201d. Manning to this day disputes the charge that he said this. Others have noted that clever coach McKay may have made the statement up to motivate the team.  After being greeted by 8,000 cheering fans when the team arrived back in Tampa late that evening after the game, the Bucs followed up the victory with a win at home over [[1977 St. Louis Cardinals (NFL) season|the St. Louis Cardinals]] during the final week of the season. Afterwards, a mob of fans ran onto the field and tore down the goalposts.\n\nThe [[1978 NFL season|1978 season]] was [[1978 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|another losing campaign]], but it was highlighted by the presence of [[rookie]] [[quarterback]] [[Doug Williams (quarterback)|Doug Williams]]. Despite a season-ending injury in which his mouth had to be wired shut, he showed enough potential to give Bucs fans hope for the future. His leadership and often electrifying play would transform the team much sooner than anyone expected. Injuries led to a 5\u201311 record, but for the first time the Buccaneers began to resemble a real team.\n\n==A brief period of success (1979 to 1982)==\nThe Bucs\u2019 situation improved rapidly in [[1979 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season| 1979]]. With the maturation of quarterback [[Doug Williams (quarterback)|Doug Williams]], the first 1,000-yard rushing season from running back [[Ricky Bell (running back)|Ricky Bell]], and a smothering, league-leading defense led by future NFL [[Pro Football Hall of Fame|Hall of Famer]] [[Lee Roy Selmon]], the Bucs kicked off the season with five consecutive victories, a stunning performance that landed them on the cover of ''[[Sports Illustrated]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dynamic.si.cnn.com/si_online/covers/issues/1979/1001.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-06-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070612064801/http://dynamic.si.cnn.com/si_online/covers/issues/1979/1001.html |archivedate=2007-06-12 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:1986 Jeno's Pizza - 20 - Cecil Johnson.jpg|thumb|right|The Buccaneers defeated the Eagles in their first playoff appearance in [[1979-80 NFL playoffs|1979]] after suffering three consecutive losing seasons.]]\nWith four games left in the season, the Bucs only needed to win one of them to make the [[1979\u201380 NFL playoffs|playoffs]], and did so in their final contest at home against [[1979 Kansas City Chiefs season|the Kansas City Chiefs]], which was played in the worst downpour in Bucs history. Finishing with a 10\u20136 record, the Bucs had their first winning season, and indeed won the Central Division in a tiebreaker over [[1979 Chicago Bears season|the Chicago Bears]].

The Bucs lost to the Rams 9\u20130, thanks to great defense by the Rams. In only their fourth season, the Bucs seemed on the verge of fulfilling McKay's five-year plan.\n\nInjuries plagued the team again [[1980 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|in 1980]], and the Bucs were limited to five wins, ten losses, and one tie against the also injury-plagued [[1980 Green Bay Packers season|Packers]].\n\n[[File:1986 Jeno's Pizza - 19 - Ricky Bell crop.jpg|thumb|left|Bucs' running back Ricky Bell rushing the ball during the 1979 NFC Divisional Playoff Game.]]\nThe Bucs made the [[1981\u201382 NFL playoffs|playoffs]] again despite mediocre performance in [[1981 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|the 1981 season]], winning a weak division and entering the first round during the [[1982 NFL strike|strike-shortened]] [[1982 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|1982 season]]. The 1981 season came down to a thrilling final game at [[1981 Detroit Lions season|Detroit]]. The winner would take the Central Division crown and the loser would miss the playoffs. The Lions had not lost at home all season. Although the Bucs trailed early, an 84-yard touchdown bomb from QB Williams to WR [[Kevin House]] and a fumble recovery for a touchdown by [[David Logan (American football)|David Logan]] sealed the shocking win for the Bucs. [[1981 Dallas Cowboys season|The Dallas Cowboys]] rewarded the Bucs\u2019 efforts with a 38\u20130 blowout in the divisional round of the playoffs.\n\nThe 1982 season started just as poorly, as the Buccaneers went 0\u20133 before a players\u2019 strike shut down the NFL for seven weeks. When the league resumed play, the Bucs were nicknamed the \u201cCardiac Kids\u201d for winning five of their next six games all in the final moments to go 5\u20134 and qualify for the [[1982\u201383 NFL playoffs|expanded playoff slate]]. In the first round, the Bucs once again faced the [[1982 Dallas Cowboys season|Cowboys]] at home in [[Texas Stadium|Dallas]], but the Bucs put up a much better fight, actually leading the game at the half but lost 30\u201317.\n\nThe Bucs did not return to the playoffs, nor have another non-losing season under Culverhouse's ownership.\n\n==The worst team in the league (1983 to 1996)==\nDoug Williams was the lowest-paid starting quarterback in the NFL during the 1982 season, and his salary of $120,000 was less than several backups. At the end of the season, Williams asked for a raise to $600,000 per season\u2014a reasonable sum at that time, given Williams\u2019 past performance and his market value. However, Culverhouse would not offer more than $400,000 despite McKay's protests. Feeling that Culverhouse was unwilling to pay him a salary befitting his status as an NFL starter, Williams bolted to the [[United States Football League|USFL]], where he played two seasons for [[Arizona Outlaws|the Oklahoma Outlaws]]. Without Williams, the Bucs appeared to be a rudderless team. [[1983 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|The Bucs]] started the [[1983 NFL season|next season]] by losing their first nine games, knocking them out of playoff contention. They finished with a 2\u201314 record, the first of an NFL-record 12 consecutive seasons with ten or more losses. Many Bucs fans blamed Williams\u2019 departure for this seemingly endless streak of futility, and the fact that Williams later returned to the NFL and led [[1987 Washington Redskins season|the Washington Redskins]] to victory in [[Super Bowl XXII]] only deepened the frustration among Bucs fans.\n\nIt can be argued that the team's lengthy woes were primarily due to how Culverhouse ran the organization. Culverhouse kept the team's payroll among the lowest in the league, which prompted few quality players to sign with the team. The ones who did rarely stayed long. Selmon, the Bucs\u2019 first draft pick in 1976 and the first Hall of Famer to have earned his credentials primarily in Tampa Bay, was the only real star who had a long tenure with the team. The Bucs suffered from several missteps in the NFL Draft, the most notorious of which was the team's selection of [[Bo Jackson]] as the #1 overall pick when he openly stated he would never play for them. In [[1977 NFL Draft|the 1977 draft]] the Bucs had passed on future Hall of Fame running back [[Tony Dorsett]] with the No. 1 overall pick in favor of [[Ricky Bell (running back)|Ricky Bell]], who had played for McKay at USC, while they subsequently traded away picks that turned into eventual Hall of Famers [[Dan Hampton]] and [[Irving Fryar]]. The franchise also frequently traded or gave up on quality players who went on to greater success on other teams. The most notable examples were all quarterbacks: Williams; [[Steve Young (American football)|Steve Young]], who was traded to [[1987 San Francisco 49ers season|the San Francisco 49ers]] after the Bucs drafted [[Vinny Testaverde]] first overall in the [[1987 NFL Draft|1987 draft]], only to become a [[Super Bowl MVP]] and [[Pro Football Hall of Fame|Hall of Famer]] with San Francisco; and Testaverde, whom the Bucs let walk to [[1992 Cleveland Browns season|the Cleveland Browns]] via [[Free agent|free agency]] in 1992.\n\nThe front-office woes affected the team regardless of who was brought in to coach. After McKay stepped down at the end of [[1984 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|the 1984 season]], [[Leeman Bennett]], who had coached the [[Atlanta Falcons]] to their first-ever playoff win, was hired.  After two disastrous 2\u201314 seasons, he was replaced by former [[New York Giants]] and [[Alabama Crimson Tide football|University of Alabama]] head coach [[Ray Perkins (wide receiver)|Ray Perkins]]. Perkins brought back much-needed discipline and \u201cthree-a-day\u201d practices, but this proved too much of a good thing.  The team was so physically drained by game day that the losses continued to pile up, and Perkins was fired before the end of [[1990 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|the 1990 season]].  Offensive coordinator [[Richard Williamson (American football)|Richard Williamson]] was elevated to head coach, and after his brief success in the final remaining games, he retained his head coaching position for the following year. The momentum didn't last, however, and Williamson was fired after [[1991 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|the 1991 season]] when the team went 3\u201313.\n\nLargely due to the Bucs\u2019 wretched showings on the field, attendances were typically among the lowest in the league. Usually, the only times that games attracted crowds anywhere near capacity were when [[History of the Chicago Bears|the Chicago Bears]] and [[History of the Green Bay Packers|Green Bay Packers]] came to town and brought thousands of their fans with them. Both teams had large followings in Tampa Bay due to the large number of Midwestern expatriates in the area. As a result, most Bucs home games were blacked out locally: at one point, 32 home games in a row from 1982 to 1986 \u2013 all or part of five seasons \u2013 were not televised locally.\n\nIt wasn't until the hiring of [[Sam Wyche]] that Bucs fans had reason for optimism. Wyche had coached the Cincinnati Bengals to [[Super Bowl XXIII|a Super Bowl appearance]], when Cincinnati might have won if not for a fourth quarter comeback engineered by 49ers QB [[Joe Montana]]. Wyche did not have immediate success in Tampa, and even his bold \u201cfive-dash-two\u201d (indicating five wins and two losses) declaration in his final season with the Bucs proved premature. However, Wyche deserves credit for drafting three key players who would later prove to be the core of the team's renewed success on defense \u2013 [[Warren Sapp]], [[Derrick Brooks]] and [[John Lynch (American football)|John Lynch]].\n\nThings only really began to change, however, after Culverhouse died of [[lung cancer]] in 1994.\n\n==New ownership, Tony Dungy, and a return to contention (1996 to 2001)==\nDespite the profitability of the Buccaneers in the 1980s, Culverhouse's death revealed a team close to [[bankruptcy]], which surprised many observers. His son, [[Miami, Florida|Miami]] attorney Hugh Culverhouse, Jr., practically forced the trustees of his father's estate to sell the team, which cast doubt on the future of the Buccaneers in Tampa. Interested parties included [[New York Yankees]] owner [[George Steinbrenner]] and [[Baltimore Orioles]] owner [[Peter Angelos]], the latter of whom publicly declared he would move the team to [[Baltimore]],<ref>\u2018NFL: Angelos Makes Tampa Offer \u2013 Oriole Owner Wants Bucs in Baltimore\u2019; ''[[Seattle Times]]'', January 9, 1995, p.

There was also talk of moving the Buccaneers to nearby [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]],<ref>Henderson, Joe; Fay, Bill and Yasinskas, Pat; \u2018Bucs go shopping Orlando officials say it is one of at least two cities the Buccaneers are considering as a new home if a stadium is not built in Tampa\u2019; ''Tampa Tribune'', November 2, 1995, p. 1</ref> but mayor [[Glenda Hood]] ruled out razing the [[Camping World Stadium|Citrus Bowl]] to build an NFL stadium.<ref>\u2018Orlando Won\u2019t Build to Land Bucs\u2019; ''USA Today'', December 3, 1995, p.

D1</ref>\n\nHowever, in a last-minute surprise, [[Malcolm Glazer]] outbid both of them for $192 million, the highest sale price for a professional sports franchise up to that point. Glazer immediately placed his sons [[Bryan Glazer|Bryan]], Edward, and [[Joel Glazer|Joel]] in charge of the team's financial affairs, and the family's deep pockets and serious commitment to fielding a winning team \u2014 in Tampa \u2014 allowed the Bucs to finally become competitive. The team's performance dramatically improved when the Glazers hired [[List of Minnesota Vikings seasons|Minnesota Vikings]] defensive coordinator [[Tony Dungy]] as head coach, jettisoned the old \u201ccreamsicle\u201d uniforms, and convinced [[Hillsborough County, Florida|Hillsborough County]] voters to raise [[sales taxes]] to partially fund the construction of [[Raymond James Stadium]].<ref>\u2018Bucs Gain Support for New Stadium\u2019; ''[[Washington Post]]'', April 2, 1996, p. D3</ref>\n\n===1996 season: Dungy\u2019s first year===\n{{main article|1996 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season}}\n\nDuring Dungy's first season in [[1996 NFL season|1996]], the team continued to struggle, starting the season 1&ndash;8. However, in the second half of the season they finished 5&ndash;2, primarily due to the performance of a defense ranked seventh in the NFL led by [[Hardy Nickerson]] and the maturing of Wyche's draftees Brooks, Lynch and Sapp.  Dungy, widely renowned for his somber, even-tempered personality, quickly brought balance and morale to the team. [[Defensive coordinator]] [[Monte Kiffin]] developed and refined their trademark [[Tampa 2]] defensive scheme, which became the foundation for Tampa Bay's future success, not to mention a blueprint copied by other teams in the NFL, including [[history of the Chicago Bears|the Chicago Bears]] and [[History of the St. Louis Rams|the St. Louis Rams]].\n\n===The 1997 season: Back to the playoffs===\n{{main article|1997 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season}}\n\nEverything finally came together in [[1997 NFL season|1997]]. The team started the season 5&ndash;0, picking up where they left off the previous year, and this quick start once again landed them on the cover of ''Sports Illustrated''\u2014not once, but twice.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dynamic.si.cnn.com/si_online/covers/issues/1997/0908.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-03-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070212122458/http://dynamic.si.cnn.com/si_online/covers/issues/1997/0908.html |archivedate=2007-02-12 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://dynamic.si.cnn.com/si_online/covers/issues/1997/0929.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-03-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070212122508/http://dynamic.si.cnn.com/si_online/covers/issues/1997/0929.html |archivedate=2007-02-12 }}</ref>  The Bucs went 10&ndash;6 for their first winning season and playoff appearance since 1982, as a wild-card team. In the Bucs\u2019 final home game at [[Houlihan's Stadium]] (formerly Tampa Stadium), the team defeated [[1997 Detroit Lions season|the Detroit Lions]] 20&ndash;10 for only the second playoff win in franchise history. They lost at [[Lambeau Field]] to the eventual NFC champion [[1997 Green Bay Packers season|Green Bay Packers]] 21&ndash;7. Still, there was reason for optimism, and the expectations were high for the following season.\n\n===1998 to 2001: \u201cThe New Sombrero\u201d===\nThe [[1998 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|1998 season]], the first to be played in the newly constructed [[Raymond James Stadium]], saw the [[1998 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|Bucs]] lose several close games en route to a disappointing 8\u20138 record.  The [[1999 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|1999 season]] saw much better fortunes.  On the strength of the NFL's number one overall defense and a surprising performance by rookie QB [[Shaun King (American football)|Shaun King]], the [[1999 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|Bucs]] finished the season with an 11&ndash;5 record and won their third NFC Central championship. They edged the [[1999 Washington Redskins season|Washington Redskins]] 14&ndash;13 in the [[NFL playoffs, 1999\u20132000|Divisional round]], before losing to the eventual Super Bowl champion [[1999 St. Louis Rams season|St. Louis Rams]] in an unusually low-scoring NFC Championship Game, 11&ndash;6.  The Bucs\u2019 loss was controversial, highlighted by the unusual reversal of a pass from King to WR [[Bert Emanuel]].  Despite the fact that Emanuel clearly controlled the ball at every point during the catch, booth replay official [[Jerry Markbreit]] ordered a review of the call. Referee [[Bill Carollo]] determined that the nose of the ball had touched the ground as he brought it into his body.  The resulting reversal all but ended the Bucs' hopes of mounting a game-winning drive. In league meetings later that year, NFL later changed the rules regarding what constituted an [[incomplete pass]], which was a backhanded admission that the reversal was incorrect.\n\n===Offensive woes===\nIn spite of Dungy's success at coaching Tampa Bay into a winner, one of the consistent criticisms from the media and from fans\u2014and later, from players including [[Warren Sapp]]\u2014was that the defense was expected to shoulder too much of the responsibility for winning games.  Beyond fullback [[Mike Alstott]] and running back [[Warrick Dunn]]\u2014who served as a one-two punch ground attack\u2014and [[wide receiver]] [[Keyshawn Johnson]], the team was otherwise underwhelming on offense.  Despite the ongoing criticism, Dungy remained staunchly loyal to his coaching staff, but at the conclusion of the 1999 season, [[General Manager (American football)|general manager]] [[Rich McKay]] forced Dungy to fire [[offensive coordinator]] [[Mike Shula]].  He was replaced by former [[List of Minnesota Vikings seasons|Minnesota Vikings]] and [[List of Tennessee Titans seasons|Tennessee Titans]] offensive coordinator [[Les Steckel]] in 2000, and the result was the Bucs' highest-scoring season ever, another 10&ndash;6 record, and another trip to the playoffs as a wild card. despite his transformation of the team's offense, Steckel's [[drill sergeant]] approach to coaching (he was a [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]] in the [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]]) was a poor fit for the franchise. He was fired at the end of the season, after the Bucs lost 21&ndash;3 to the [[2000 Philadelphia Eagles season|Philadelphia Eagles]].\n\nRather than choose from the pool of strong offensive coordinators available at the end of the 2000 campaign (including former Redskins coach [[Norv Turner]]), Dungy decided to elevate his receivers coach [[Clyde Christensen]] to the position. It can be argued that this controversial decision was the final nail in the coffin for Dungy's tenure. Although the [[2001 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|team]] achieved a 9&ndash;7 winning record in [[2001 NFL season|2001]], they barely made it into the playoffs as the lowest-seeded wild card.  To add insult to injury, the Bucs were once again blown out by the Eagles\u2014this time, 31&ndash;9.\n\nFrustrated with the team's inability to reach the Super Bowl despite a league-dominating defense, Malcolm Glazer fired Dungy the following day\u2014a decision that created more controversy among devoted players and fans.  Despite whatever weaknesses that may have been ascribed to him, Dungy was highly respected around the league as a man of solid character and a coach to whom players were fiercely loyal.  Dungy went on to coach the Colts to the [[Super Bowl XLI]] championship against the [[2006 Chicago Bears season|Chicago Bears]], in the process becoming the first [[African-American]] head coach to win the Super Bowl.\n\n==Jon Gruden, the Super Bowl, and beyond (2002 to 2008)==\nDungy was soon hired as the head coach of [[2002 Indianapolis Colts season|the Indianapolis Colts]], while the Bucs mounted a prolonged and much-maligned search for his replacement.  Several potential candidates were offered the job, including [[Florida Gators football|University of Florida]] head coach [[Steve Spurrier]], [[Bill Parcells]] and [[List of Baltimore Ravens seasons|Baltimore Ravens]] defensive coordinator [[Marvin Lewis]]. Spurrier jumped to the Redskins when he was offered the most lucrative salary package ever offered to an NFL head coach, and Parcells eventually passed on the Bucs\u2019 offer\u2014the second time he had done so in the history of the franchise.  Bucs general manager Rich McKay threw his support behind Lewis, and his hiring appeared so certain that the Ravens held a going-away party for him.<ref>Harry, Chris. [http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2002-02-09/sports/0202090250_1_marvin-lewis-glazers-mckay This is Ridiculous!] ''[[Orlando Sentinel]]'', 2002-02-09.</ref> The Glazer brothers were so displeased with the selection of a yet another defensive-minded coach that they overruled McKay and took control of the candidate search themselves. They made it clear that their top choice was [[Jon Gruden]]. The problem was that he was still under contract to the [[Oakland Raiders]].\n\nWhile talks with the Raiders were secretly underway, the Glazers publicly pursued another respected offensive mind, [[San Francisco 49ers]] head coach [[Steve Mariucci]].  Just when initial reports indicated that Mariucci had agreed to become both the Bucs' head coach and general manager, Raiders owner [[Al Davis]] agreed to release Jon Gruden to Tampa Bay.  Observers suggested that the Glazers' offer to Mariucci was merely a clever bargaining tactic: since Davis' large ego is well documented, it was very likely he wouldn't allow such a blockbuster trade to take place so near his turf.  If the tactic didn't work, then the Bucs would still get the type of head coach the Glazers desired.\n\nThe Glazers\u2019 shrewd move eventually paid off in acquiring Gruden, but it cost the team dearly.  The team hired Gruden away from the Raiders on February 20, 2002, but the price was four [[NFL Draft|draft]] picks, including the Bucs' first and second round picks in 2002, their first round pick in 2003, and their second round selection in 2004, along with $8 million in cash; the league as a result prohibited any further trading of draft picks for coaches. Gruden, who was frustrated by the limitation of his coaching authority by Davis, was more than pleased to return to Tampa Bay, as his parents lived nearby, and he had spent part of his childhood in Tampa in the early 1980s when his father had worked as a Bucs running back coach and director of player personnel.\n\n===The 2002 season: Super Bowl champions===\nUpon his arrival in Tampa, Gruden immediately went to work, acquiring former [[2001 Jacksonville Jaguars season|Jacksonville Jaguars]] WR [[Keenan McCardell]], and RB [[Michael Pittman]] from [[2001 Arizona Cardinals season|the Arizona Cardinals]]. The Bucs needed to improve their sluggish offense, as the league's sweeping realignment sent the Bucs to the new [[NFC South]] division, along with [[2002 Atlanta Falcons season|the Atlanta Falcons]], [[2002 Carolina Panthers season|Carolina Panthers]] and [[2002 New Orleans Saints season|New Orleans Saints]].\n\nThe offensive retooling worked, and combined with the league's top defense, the 2002 campaign was the Buccaneers\u2019 most successful season to date.  They won the NFC South title with a 12\u20134 record\u2014the team's best ever\u2014then defeated the [[2002 San Francisco 49ers season|San Francisco 49ers]] in what became coach [[Steve Mariucci]]\u2019s last game with that franchise. In a surprising upset, the Bucs won their first NFC Championship on the road against the [[2002 Philadelphia Eagles season|Eagles]] in the last NFL game ever played at [[Veterans Stadium]]. [[Cornerback]] [[Ronde Barber]] capped off the win by intercepting a [[Donovan McNabb]] pass and returning it 92 yards for a touchdown late in the fourth quarter. Philadelphia fans could only watch in stunned silence.\n\nThe Bucs went on to rout Gruden\u2019s former team, the [[2002 Oakland Raiders season|Oakland Raiders]], by a score of 48\u201321 in [[Super Bowl XXXVII]]. Gruden\u2019s familiarity with the Raiders\u2019 players and playbook paid off, as [[John Lynch (American football)|John Lynch]] and other Bucs players recognized some of Oakland's formations and plays at crucial points in the game.<ref>http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/inside_game/peter_king/news/2003/02/03/mmqb/</ref> The Bucs became the first team to win the Super Bowl without any picks in the first two rounds of the previous spring's [[2002 NFL Draft|NFL Draft]], having traded these picks to the [[Oakland Raiders]] for the rights to acquire Gruden. Gruden became the youngest head coach to win a Super Bowl.\n\n===2003 and 2004: Front-office tensions===\nSoon after the Super Bowl victory, a growing number of press reports indicated Gruden's lack of patience with general manager McKay. McKay was a major architect of the Bucs rebuilding effort over the previous ten years, and he, like Gruden, had long-established ties to the [[Tampa Bay area]]. However, during the 2003 season, the Gruden-McKay relationship deteriorated as the Bucs struggled on the field. In November, Keyshawn Johnson was deactivated by the team ten games into the season for his conduct, which included sideline arguments with Bucs coaches and players. Johnson was eventually traded to the [[Dallas Cowboys]] for wide receiver [[Joey Galloway]].\n\nJohnson's unusual deactivation was a definitive sign that Gruden had indeed gained control. In December, the Glazers allowed McKay to leave the Bucs before the end of the regular season, and he promptly joined the Falcons as president and general manager. Thus, McKay watched his first game as a Falcons executive sitting next to owner [[Arthur Blank]] in a Raymond James Stadium skybox. The [[2003 Atlanta Falcons season|Falcons]] defeated the [[2003 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|Bucs]] 30\u201328, another sign of how the season had spiraled downward.  Despite opening the season with a Monday night win over the Eagles in Philadelphia's new stadium, [[Lincoln Financial Field]], the Bucs finished the season 7\u20139. Combined with the [[2003 Oakland Raiders season|Raiders']] dismal 4-12 performance, neither Super Bowl team reached the [[2003\u201304 NFL playoffs|playoffs]] that year.\n\nBefore the 2004 training camp, personnel issues and the salary cap became primary concerns. Gruden successfully lobbied the Glazers to hire his former general manager from Oakland, [[Bruce Allen (American football)|Bruce Allen]]. After Allen's arrival in the Bucs' front office, the team announced that it would not resign two of their best defensive players\u2014John Lynch and Warren Sapp\u2014before the regular season even started. Both of their contracts were expiring, and younger players could fill their positions. Lynch was released after medical exams indicated ongoing injury problems. Many Bucs fans were stunned by the move, as Lynch was a very popular player whose aggressive, intelligent play earned him several [[Pro Bowl]] appearances.  He was also well regarded for his philanthropic work in the Tampa Bay area.  Lynch was quickly signed by the [[Denver Broncos]], where he had consecutive injury-free Pro Bowl seasons.  Sapp signed with the Oakland Raiders, where he played in a limited role in 2004, and sat out much of the 2005 season with injuries.  Since wide receiver Keenan McCardell refused to play until he was given a better contract or traded, he was sent to the [[San Diego Chargers]] for draft compensation.\n\nThe distracted Bucs began the [[2004 NFL season|2004 season]] with a 1\u20135 record, their worst start since Gruden arrived.  The fading accuracy of [[placekicker|kicker]] [[Martin Gramatica]] didn't help matters, as the team lost many close games en route to a 5\u201311 record, making the Bucs the first NFL team to follow up a Super Bowl championship with back-to-back losing seasons.  The lone highlights of 2004 were the high-quality play of rookie wide receiver [[Michael Clayton (American football)|Michael Clayton]] and the return of Doug Williams, who joined the Bucs front office as a personnel executive.\n\n===The 2005 season: Another division crown===\n{{main article|2005 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season}}\n\nIn the [[2005 NFL season|2005 season]], the Bucs returned to their winning ways. The Buccaneers selected [[Carnell Williams|Carnell \u201cCadillac\u201d Williams]] in the first round of the [[2005 NFL Draft|2005 draft]], and the rookie would provide a running game the Buccaneers hadn't possessed since the days of [[James Wilder Sr.]] in the 1980s.  Williams set the NFL record for most yards rushing in his first three games with 474, and was named as the AP's 2005 Offensive Rookie of the Year. His shoes and gloves from the third game of the season are now on display in the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]].\n\n<!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:Th 2pts.jpg|frame|right|The replay of the controversial 2-Point Conversion was deemed inconclusive]] -->\nWith their 2005 campaign marking the Buccaneers' 30th Season in the NFL, the team won their first four games before entering a midseason slump hampered by a season-ending injury to starting QB [[Brian Griese]] during a win over the [[2005 Miami Dolphins season|Miami Dolphins]]. Replacement starter [[Chris Simms]] struggled early as the Bucs lost games to the [[2005 San Francisco 49ers season|San Francisco 49ers]] and [[2005 Carolina Panthers season|Carolina Panthers]], but Simms came into his own when he led the team to a last-minute win over the [[2005 Washington Redskins season|Washington Redskins]] in a 36\u201335 thriller to break that slump. In a gutsy move, Gruden went for the win with a [[two-point conversion]] plunge by [[fullback (American football)|fullback]] [[Mike Alstott]].  A booth review of that play was inconclusive, and Redskins coach [[Joe Gibbs]] stated after the game his belief that Alstott had not scored.\n\nThe Bucs followed up with important wins over their NFC South division rivals, sweeping both the [[2005 New Orleans Saints season|New Orleans Saints]] and [[2005 Atlanta Falcons season|Atlanta Falcons]], as well as defeating the Panthers in a rare victory at Carolina.  Even with a tough loss against the [[2005 Chicago Bears season|Chicago Bears]] and a humiliating [[shutout]] against the [[2005 New England Patriots season|New England Patriots]], the Bucs finished 11\u20135 and won the NFC South by virtue of a tie-breaker over the Panthers. The Bucs' 30th Anniversary season would end on a sour note, as they lost 17\u201310 at home to the Redskins in the wild-card round. A late Bucs touchdown could have tied the game, but the play was ruled incomplete when a [[instant replay|booth review]] upheld the [[Referee (American football)|referee]]\u2019s decision.\n\nThe Bucs sent three veteran players to the [[2006 Pro Bowl]], including cornerback [[Ronde Barber]] and [[Punter (football position)|punter]] [[Josh Bidwell]]. [[Outside linebacker]] [[Derrick Brooks]] was named the Pro Bowl MVP, with a 59-yard interception return for a touchdown.\n\n===2006===\n{{main article|2006 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season}}\n\nAfter winning their division in 2005, the Bucs suffered through an abysmal [[2006 NFL season|2006 season]]. The season was plagued by injuries, with starters such as G [[Dan Buenning]], WR [[Michael Clayton (American football)|Michael Clayton]], RB [[Carnell Williams]], DE [[Simeon Rice]], CB [[Brian Kelly (cornerback)|Brian Kelly]], and QB [[Chris Simms]] all being placed on injured reserve at some point in the season. The season also saw a lot of rookies starting for the Bucs, such as QB [[Bruce Gradkowski]], T [[Jeremy Trueblood]], and G [[Davin Joseph]]. The league schedule was also unfriendly to the Bucs, scheduling them for 3 games (two of them away games) within 11 days of each other. \n\nThere was more to the lost season than just injuries however, as most of the players put on injured reserve had been done so after the team's 0\u20133 start, and offensive shutouts in the first two games in which no touchdowns were scored by the Buccaneers. The departure of several key defensive coaches and assistants didn't bode well with players, who complained to some in the media of not being able to hear coaches in team meetings.\n\nInconsistent and unorganized are how some players referred to one of the newcomers, who most players had a hard time making the transition from long-time favorites [[Rod Marinelli]] and others. Some believe the problems in 2006 were rooted in recent years mistakes, lack of [[salary cap]] room to bring in high impact free agents, lack of top 50 draft picks over the last 5 or 6 years due to trades, and maybe even a failure to properly assess talent resulting in a lack of contribution from second day draft picks in recent history.\n\nThe Bucs started off the season 0\u20133, with QB Chris Simms throwing only one touchdown against seven interceptions. In the third game of the season, a last-minute loss to the [[2006 Carolina Panthers season|Carolina Panthers]], Simms's spleen was ruptured, and he was placed on injured reserve for the rest of the season. After their bye week, the Bucs elected to start rookie quarterback [[Bruce Gradkowski]], a 6th round pick from [[Toledo Rockets football|Toledo]].\n\nGradkowski started off performing decently. People who in hindsight claim the Bucs should have started the more experienced [[Tim Rattay]] forget the Bucs nearly upset the [[2006 New Orleans Saints season|New Orleans Saints]], and then went on to win two narrow victories: one, against the [[2006 Cincinnati Bengals season|Cincinnati Bengals]], winning on an overturned call resulting in a touchdown; and another against the [[Philadelphia Eagles]], thanks to [[Matt Bryant]]\u2019s 62-yard field goal. After these victories, though, Gradkowski\u2019s performance declined. After a 3\u201317 loss to [[2006 New York Giants season|the New York Giants]] in heavy winds, the Bucs proceeded to lose five of their next six games, leading them to a record of 3\u201310 (0\u20136 in their division). In the loss to [[2006 Atlanta Falcons season|the Atlanta Falcons]], Gradkowski was replaced in the 4th quarter by Rattay.\n\nIn the first half of the Bucs\u2019 next game, against the [[2006 Chicago Bears season|Chicago Bears]], Gradkowski was again replaced by Rattay, who led the team from a 24\u20133 deficit to a score of 31\u201331, with three touchdowns in the fourth quarter. However, the Bucs then lost the game in overtime, 34\u201331. Rattay was then named the new starting quarterback for the last two games for the season. The Bucs finished their season with a 4\u201312 record, tied for third worst in the NFL.\n\nThe Bucs sent three players to the [[2007 Pro Bowl]], cornerback [[Ronde Barber]], tight end/long snapper [[Dave Moore (American football player)|Dave Moore]] (A \u201cNeed\u201d player according to Saints coach [[Sean Payton]]), and late addition outside linebacker [[Derrick Brooks]] (as an injury replacement). This would be Brooks' 10th consecutive Pro Bowl and 10th Pro Bowl overall.\n\n===2007: A return to grace===\n2007 began well for the Buccaneers, as they made a splash in the off season signing veteran quarterback [[Jeff Garcia]], linebackers [[Cato June]] and [[Patrick Chukwurah]], and former New York Jets fullback [[B.J. Askew]]. However, they suffered heavy losses also, releasing three-time pro bowl defensive end [[Simeon Rice]] and starting middle linebacker [[Shelton Quarles]], both of whom spent the majority of their career in Tampa Bay. Further disappointment came in the form of a neck injury sustained by 6-time pro bowler and 12-year veteran fullback [[Mike Alstott]] in a preseason match against the [[New England Patriots]]. The injury placed Alstott on injured reserve for the rest of the season, and ultimately led to his retirement in January 2008.\n\nThe [[2007 NFL season|regular season]] began with a crushing 20\u20136 loss to the [[2007 Seattle Seahawks season|Seattle Seahawks]] in [[Qwest Field]]. But by week 6 the Bucs had turned their fortunes around and had a record of 4\u20132, including home victories against division rivals the [[2007 Carolina Panthers season|Carolina Panthers]] and the [[2007 New Orleans Saints season|New Orleans Saints]]. Running Back Carnell \u201cCadillac\u201d Williams suffered a season-ending torn [[patellar tendon]] in a week 4 home victory over the Panthers, which contributed to a 33-14 blowout loss to former Bucs head coach Tony Dungy's [[2007 Indianapolis Colts season|Indianapolis Colts]] the next week. The Buccaneers' misfortune against non-divisional teams was countered as the season progressed by their domination of the [[NFC South]]. In week 15, [[Micheal Spurlock]] recorded the first ever kick return touchdown ever scored by a Tampa Bay Buccaneer in a home victory against the [[2007 Atlanta Falcons season|Atlanta Falcons]]. They won all but one of their divisional games and, at the peak of their success, had a record of 9\u20135. Many factors contributed to this, such as the problems faced by Atlanta, whose star quarterback [[Michael Vick]] had been arrested on dog fighting charges in the preseason, and the season-ending [[Anterior cruciate ligament|ACL]] tear suffered by New Orleans running back [[Deuce McAllister]]. they finished off the season on a low point, however, but still won the NFC South division, and qualified for a [[2007\u201308 NFL playoffs|playoff spot]] at 9\u20137.\n\nTampa Bay were set to host the [[2007 New York Giants season|New York Giants]] at Raymond James Stadium for their second home playoff game in three seasons. They began well opening up the scoreboard with the first touchdown of the game, which was a 1-yard [[Earnest Graham]] run. However, the Giants outscored the Bucs 24-0 until the last three minutes of play, when Jeff Garcia completed a touchdown pass to [[Alex Smith]] to bring the Bucs back to just a ten-point deficit, although an interception by [[R.W. McQuarters]] with two minutes left, sealed the victory for Giants. In the end the Buccaneers had been held to 271 yards of total offense and 3 turnovers, and lost the game 24\u201314.\n\n===2008===\nOn January 28, the Buccaneers re-signed head coach Jon Gruden and GM Bruce Allen through the 2011 season. Also during the offseason, the Buccaneers expressed interest in acquiring QB Brett Favre from Green Bay, but he eventually signed with the New York Jets instead. The 2008 regular season began with a loss to New Orleans, followed by three wins, a loss to Denver, two more wins, a defeat in Dallas, and four wins over the Chiefs, Vikings, Lions, and Saints. At 9\u20133, the Buccaneers were close to guaranteeing their place in the playoffs, with 4 games remaining in the season. However, they fell to Carolina on Monday Night Football, which ended their chances of successfully repeating as division champions. They next lost to Atlanta in overtime, followed by their first home loss of the season to San Diego.\n\nThe final week of the season still held playoff hopes, although it would take a Buccaneers win over Oakland coupled with a Dallas loss. The Buccaneers couldn't hold their 4th quarter lead against the Raiders, and lost 31\u201324. Adding insult to injury, Dallas lost their final game against Philadelphia, giving the Eagles the final wild card playoff spot over Dallas and the Bucs. Having finished 9\u20137 and missing the playoffs, Jon Gruden was fired January 16, 2009, almost one year to the date he received a contract-extension. GM Bruce Allen was fired on the same date as well. This would usher in a wholesale change of coaches and players leading up to the 2009 season, with [[Raheem Morris]] being elevated to head coach on January 17.\n\n==A Coaching Carousel and Out of the Playoffs (2009 onwards)==\n===Raheem Morris era (2009 to 2011)===\n===2009===\nAlthough the 2008 season was a disappointment, 2009 would prove a disaster for the Buccaneers. The team lost seven consecutive matches, including an international series game with New England in London. Finally, in Week 9, the team donned its orange-and-white throwback uniforms and hosted the Packers. Green Bay was struggling with a weak O-line, and the Buccaneers swept to victory 38\u201328 after a pair of touchdown passes by rookie QB [[Josh Freeman]]. Afterwards, the losses resumed as Tampa Bay dropped four games in a row against Miami, New Orleans, Atlanta, Carolina, and New York before they brought down Seattle in Week 15, followed by New Orleans. The team lost the season ender against Atlanta to finish 3\u201313.\n\n===2010===\nThe poor 2009 record of Tampa Bay was in part due to a youthful, inexperienced team (barring a few exceptions such as 35-year-old CB Ronde Barber, the last remaining member of the 2002 Super Bowl team), and it was hoped that they would improve with time. The Buccaneers got off to a 2\u20130 start in 2010 by beating Cleveland and Carolina, but both proved weak opponents and they could never handle Pittsburgh, a team only two years removed from its 2008 Super Bowl win, losing 38\u201313. Following their bye week, they beat the Bengals in Cincinnati 24\u201321.  After the road victory in Cincinnati, the Bucs came home to face the defending Super Bowl champion Saints, who were struggling after a loss to the Arizona Cardinals in which the Cardinals did not score an offensive touchdown, but capitalized on New Orleans turnovers.  A victory would have helped the Bucs towards first place in the NFC South; however, they were blown out 31\u20136.  The next week saw another home deficit against the St. Louis Rams with the Bucs trailing 6\u201317 at halftime.  Strong defense shut down the Rams\u2019 offense in the second half, and with two field goals and a late touchdown pass to Carnell \u201cCadillac\u201d Williams, the Bucs topped the Rams 18\u201317.  After the game with the team standing at 4\u20132, head coach Raheem Morris would famously state, \u201cWe\u2019re the best team in the NFC.\u201d<ref>http://www.pewterreport.com/index.php?option=com_k2&view=item&id=6262:morris-explains-best-team-in-nfc-remark</ref>  The following week, the Bucs would make good on Morris's claim by defeating the Arizona Cardinals on the road in a game where they led 31\u201314,  fell behind late 35\u201331, then retook the lead 38\u201335 and sealed the victory with an [[Aqib Talib]] interception of Cardinals quarterback [[Derek Anderson (American football)|Derek Anderson]] near the end zone.  With the Bucs and the Atlanta Falcons tied for first place in the division at 5\u20132, a matchup in Atlanta gave the Bucs a chance to take sole possession of first place.  Trailing 27\u201314 in the second half, Bucs returner Micheal Spurlock returned a Falcons kickoff for a touchdown to put the Bucs within a touchdown of the lead.  The game came down to fourth down attempt to score from the Falcons 1 yard-line. Rookie running back [[LeGarrette Blount]] was stopped up the middle and gave the Falcons the close victory.  Following the tough loss, the Bucs came home and defeated the Carolina Panthers 31\u201316 before going on the road against the San Francisco 49ers and pitching a 21\u20130 shutout.  The next week, the Bucs road game against [[2010 Baltimore Ravens season|the Baltimore Ravens]], their fourth game away from Raymond James Stadium in five weeks, was moved to a late start, and the Bucs lost a hard-fought defensive struggle 17\u201310. Finally returning home the next week, the team sported their throwback creamsicle uniforms and honored coach John McKay at halftime in a home contest against the Falcons on national television. With a great defensive performance and two interceptions of Falcons quarterback [[Matt Ryan (American football)|Matt Ryan]], it seemed the Bucs would get revenge on the Falcons for their loss four weeks ago, leading 24\u201314 deep in the second half.  But Falcons returner [[Eric Weems]] returned a kick for a touchdown and the Falcons scored offensively to take a 28\u201324 lead.  Quarterback Josh Freeman attempted the late comeback as he had against the Browns, Bengals, Rams, and Cardinals, but was denied with a [[Brent Grimes]] interception.  At 7\u20135, the Bucs\u2019 playoff hopes seemed less assured, and the team had yet to defeat an opponent with a winning record, while several key starters had been lost for the season.  In a rainy outing at Washington, the Bucs prevailed 17\u201316 thanks to a botched extra-point attempt by the Redskins, but lost to the Detroit Lions at home in overtime to break the Lions' historic road losing streak.  Needing help to make the playoffs as a wild-card team, the Bucs routed the eventual NFC West champion Seattle Seahawks 38\u201315 in Tampa.  With the last week of the regular season on the slate, the Bucs needed to defeat the New Orleans Saints in the [[Louisiana Superdome|Superdome]], then hope for the defeats of the Green Bay Packers and the New York Giants by the Chicago Bears and Washington Redskins, respectively, as both teams held playoff tiebreakers over the Buccaneers.  The Saints planned to fight the Bucs equally hard, as a victory and a Falcons loss to the Carolina Panthers would give them the #1 seed in the NFC.  The game was close and hard-fought throughout the first half, but two key turnovers by the Bucs defense, a [[Barrett Ruud]] forced fumble of Saints running back [[Julius Jones]] near the Bucs' goal line and an interception of Saints quarterback [[Drew Brees]] near the end of the half, gave the Bucs the slight edge.  A Saints field goal in the fourth quarter cut the Tampa Bay lead to 20\u201313, but with the Falcons holding a large lead over the Panthers, Saints coach [[Sean Payton]] chose to sit Brees and put in backup [[Chase Daniel]].  The Bucs held on and won the game 23\u201313,<ref>http://espn.go.com/nfl/team/schedule/_/name/tb/year/2010/tampa-bay-buccaneers</ref> finishing the season with a 10\u20136 record, their best since 2005.  However, the Packers and Giants both won close games as well, thus sending the eventual Super Bowl champion Packers to the playoffs.  For the second time in three years, the Bucs had finished with a winning record, yet missed the playoffs.  The season marked a 7-game improvement over the previous one, and was highlighted by the superb play of second-year quarterback Josh Freeman and a strong rookie class led by [[Gerald McCoy]], [[Arrelious Benn]], [[Mike Williams (wide receiver, born 1987)|Mike Williams]], [[Cody Grimm]], and [[LeGarrette Blount]].  No Buccaneers were selected to the Pro Bowl, but left tackle [[Donald Penn]] did play in the game as a replacement for Green Bay's [[Chad Clifton]], marking Penn's first appearance.  Raheem Morris finished second in AP NFL Coach of the Year voting, and Mike Williams finished second in Offensive Rookie of the Year voting.\n\n===2011===\nThe Buccaneers went into 2011 with high expectations, but they ended up not materializing. Things began on an ominous note when they lost at home in Week 1 to the Lions, who had beaten them the previous December and denied them a playoff appearance. At the bye in Week 7, the Bucs were 4\u20133 and looked promising to make a postseason push. All of that changed rapidly when they abruptly collapsed and ended up not winning another game for the rest of the season for the longest losing streak in franchise history since 1977. On January 2, 2012, Morris was fired as head coach of the Buccaneers after a 4\u201312 season, including losing their last ten games.<ref>{{cite news |title=Bucs fire coach Raheem Morris |url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/7413905/tampa-bay-buccaneers-fire-coach-raheem-morris-10-game-losing-skid |publisher=[[ESPN.com]] |date=January 2, 2012 |accessdate=2012-01-02}}</ref>\n\n===2012 and 2013: Greg Schiano era===\n[[File:JaguarsBucs2011.JPG|thumbnail|left|The Bucs vs the [[Jacksonville Jaguars]]]]\nAbout three weeks after firing [[Raheem Morris]], the Buccaneers hired [[Greg Schiano]] from [[Rutgers Scarlet Knights football|Rutgers]] as the new head coach. During his introductory conference he stated \u201cThere will be Buccaneer men, and there will be a Buccaneer Way.\u201d The phrase ''\u201cThe Buccaneer Way\u201d'' became a slogan amongst fans and local media, describing the new regime and attitude. The team filled out the coaching staff with new faces, including [[Mike Sullivan (American football coach)|Mike Sullivan]], [[Bill Sheridan]], and [[Butch Davis]]. In 2013, [[Dave Wannstedt]] was also added as special teams coach. In the first day of free agency, the club signed top prospects [[Vincent Jackson]] and [[Carl Nicks (American football)|Carl Nicks]], as well as [[Eric Wright (cornerback, born 1985)|Eric Wright]]. The $140 million committed to the team during that 24-hour period is considered the largest investment the Glazer family has put into the team going back almost a decade.\n\nThe team would finish the [[2012 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|2012 season]] at 7\u20139, notably ranking first in rushing defense. Furthermore, the rushing offense was highlighted by the breakout performance of [[Doug Martin (running back)|Doug Martin]]. After two seasons of game day local television blackouts, the improved team began seeing increased attendance and attention, and some blackouts lifted. Six games were blacked out in 2012. For the three-year period of 2010-2012 the Bucs led the NFL in local television blackouts with 19 (Cincinnati was second with 11).  Schiano's strict and regimented coaching style, however, drew criticism at the end of the game against the Giants, ordering his defense to continue to aggressively tackle the offense as the quarterback was taking a knee to end the game.\n\nComing into the [[2013 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|2013 season]], fans and analysts had better than average expectations for Tampa Bay. They were expected to improve their record, and potentially make a playoffs run. The predictions proved unfounded, as numerous issues on and off the field saw the team collapse. During training camp, a reported rift began to divide Schiano and quarterback Josh Freeman. After an 0\u20133 start, Freeman was benched, and ultimately released. Schiano started rookie [[Mike Glennon]], but the team continued to lose. The fans' confidence of Schiano began to decay rapidly, and after an 0\u20138 start, the team finally got its first win of the season on a Monday night against Miami. A brief win streak saw improvements with Glennon at quarterback, and [[Bobby Rainey]] took over at running back with stellar numbers after [[Doug Martin (running back)|Doug Martin]] went down with a shoulder injury. There were no blackouts in 2013, as the Glazers bought up the necessary tickets for two of the games to get to the 85% threshold needed to prevent local blackouts.\n\nDespite some individual improvements, and some impressive performances by members of the defense, the team dropped the last three games of the season, and finished 4\u201312. The team ranked last or near the bottom in almost every offensive category. On December 30, 2013, Schiano and general manager [[Mark Dominik]] were fired.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/eye-on-football/24391908/report-greg-schiano-and-gm-mark-dominik-fired-by-buccaneers|title=Greg Schiano and GM Mark Dominik fired by Buccaneers|publisher=[[CBS Sports]]|date=December 30, 2013|accessdate=December 30, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===2014 and 2015: Lovie Smith and Jason Licht era===\n[[File:Buccaneers at Browns 2014.jpg|thumb|right|2014 marked the first season under coach Lovie Smith.]]\nOn January 1, 2014, [[Lovie Smith]] was hired as the new head coach of the Buccaneers, replacing [[Greg Schiano]]. Smith had previously spent 5 seasons with the Buccaneers from 1996 to 2001 coaching the linebackers under [[Tony Dungy]]. During his first news conference with the Bucs, Smith talked about restoring the quality of the team from the late 1990s and early 2000s: \u201cThere was a certain brand of football you expected from us\u201d, Smith said. \u201cYou know we would be relentless. There was a brand of football that you got from us each week at Raymond James Stadium. It was hard for opponents to come in and win. We have gotten away from that a little bit, and it\u2019s time ... for us to become a relevant team again.\"\n\nOn January 21, 2014, [[Jason Licht]] was hired as the new general manager, replacing [[Mark Dominik]]. He was officially introduced at One Buc Place on January 23, 2014. In his first news conference, Licht talked about his philosophy:{{cquote|Our philosophy is going to be to build through the draft.

Those predictions soon went away after the Bucs began the season 0\u20133, including a 56\u201314 blowout against [[2014 Atlanta Falcons season|the Atlanta Falcons]] on Thursday Night Football. McCown was injured in that game, and second year quarterback [[Mike Glennon]] was named the starter. His first start of the 2014 season ended with the Bucs earning their first victory of the season in Pittsburgh against the Steelers 27\u201324. The Bucs lost the next 4 games, two overtime loses against [[2014 New Orleans Saints season|the New Orleans Saints]] and [[2014 Minnesota Vikings season|the Minnesota Vikings]], one blowout against [[2015 Baltimore Ravens season|the Baltimore Ravens]] and a 5-point loss against [[2014 Cleveland Browns season|the Cleveland Browns]]. Going into week 10 at 1\u20138, McCown returned as the starter. Mathematically, the Bucs were still in playoff contention only being 3 games out of first place in the division. McCown's first game back ended with a 27\u201317 loss to the Falcons but won the following week in a 27\u20137 blowout against the struggling [[2014 Washington Redskins season|Washington Redskins]]. The Bucs would lose the next three games and were officially knocked out of playoff contention in week 14. The Bucs would finish 2\u201314, winning two fewer games than the previous season and securing the first-overall draft pick in the [[2015 NFL draft]].\n\nDespite the team's record, first-round draft pick wide receiver [[Mike Evans (wide receiver)|Mike Evans]] had more than 1,000 receiving yards and he became the youngest NFL player to record more than 200 receiving yards in a single game. Vincent Jackson also had more than 1,000 yards receiving, which represented Tampa Bay's first pair of 1,000 yard receivers in a season. Second-year CB Johnthan Banks led the team with 4 interceptions and had 50 tackles. Danny Lansanah flourished in the Tampa 2 system with 81 tackles, 1.5 QB sacks, and 3 interceptions, with 2 of those interceptions returned for touchdowns for the 2014 season. Jacquies Smith, who was signed from Buffalo after waiving rookie DE Scott Solomon a month into the season, had 17 combined tackles, 13 solo tackles, 6.5 sacks, and 1 forced fumble in only 8 starts for 2014.\n\nAfter the conclusion of the 2014 season, Tampa Bay hired [[Ben Steele]] to become the team's new offensive quality control coach as well as former [[Atlanta Falcons]] offensive coordinator, [[Dirk Koetter]], to be their new offensive coordinator after parting ways with QB coach and interim offensive coordinator [[Marcus Arroyo]]. Having a 2\u201314 record, tied for worst in the NFL, Tampa gained the 1st overall pick in the 2015 NFL draft. They also made some headlines when they released QB [[Josh McCown]] on February 11, 2015 to save $5.25 million in cap space. With the first overall pick in the NFL draft, the Buccaneers selected [[Jameis Winston]] from Florida State. Throughout the offseason, there was much debate whether the Buccaneers should pick Jameis, or Oregon QB [[Marcus Mariota]].\n\nOn January 6, 2016, Smith was fired by the Buccaneers after posting a record of 8\u201324 in his two seasons, including a 6\u201310 record in the 2015 season.\n\n=== 2016-2018: Dirk Koetter era ===\nOn January 15, 2016, Dirk Koetter was promoted from Offensive Coordinator to become the new head coach of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. <ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.buccaneers.com/news/dirk-koetter-named-buccaneers-head-coach-16700643|title=Dirk Koetter Named Buccaneers Head Coach |date=January 15, 2016|publisher=Buccaneers.com}}</ref>\n\nInitially the Buccaneers had success with Koetter as their head coach when they finished 9-7 for their first winning season since 2010.

The team's first home was [[Tampa Stadium]], which had recently been expanded to seat just over 72,000 fans.\n\n==John McKay and early frustration (1976 to 1978)==\nThe Buccaneers joined the [[National Football League|NFL]] as members of the [[AFC West]] in 1976. The following year, they were moved to the [[NFC Central]], while the other 1976 expansion team, the [[Seattle Seahawks]], switched conferences with Tampa Bay and joined the AFC West. This realignment was dictated by the league as part of the 1976 expansion plan, so that both teams could play each other twice and every other NFL franchise once during their first two seasons.\n\nLongtime [[USC Trojans football|USC]] coach [[John McKay (football coach)|John McKay]] was recruited as the team's first head coach. McKay had never been a fan of the NFL and turned down three previous offers for a coaching position, but was finally convinced after being offered a $3 million contract and the challenge of building a new team from scratch. He stressed a five-year plan that relied on veteran players, quality draft picks, and patience. However, [[1976 NFL Expansion Draft|the expansion draft]] prior to the entrance of the Bucs and Seahawks into the league was not as generous as it would become for later NFL expansion teams, so the Buccaneers were saddled with aging veterans and castoffs from other teams. Despite McKay's coaching, the Bucs often appeared incompetent, with missed tackles, fumbled snaps, and a frustrating inability to score, and the patience of fans and local media soon wore thin. McKay was also criticized for relying too much on the USC playbook\u2014for example, the \u201cstudent body right\u201d rushing play\u2014not to mention choosing [[running back]] [[Ricky Bell (running back)|Ricky Bell]] over future NFL Hall of Famer [[Tony Dorsett]] in the [[1977 NFL Draft]].\n\nThis frustration, and even anger, that Buccaneer fans targeted at McKay \u2013 which prompted the brief popularity of bumper stickers that proclaimed \u201cThrow McKay in the Bay\u201d \u2013 stemmed from the team's notorious 26-game regular season losing streak, including a then-record 0\u201314 season (a record since broken by [[2008 Detroit Lions season|the 2008 Detroit Lions]] and [[2017 Cleveland Browns season|2017 Cleveland Browns]] who each finished 0\u201316). [[1976 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|The 1976 Bucs]] are widely considered one of the worst NFL teams of all time. They were shut out five times and scored only 125 points the entire season, an average of nine per game, while giving up 412. The Buccaneers suffered so many injuries that they were forced to hire players off the street and from the [[Canadian Football League|CFL]]. The team became the butt of many jokes, especially from [[Johnny Carson]] on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson|The Tonight Show]]'', but also from fans themselves, who late into the 1977 season, wore bags on their heads and encouraged the team to \u201cgo for 0\u201d, as in zero wins. After a particularly dismal effort during the streak, coach McKay gave perhaps the quintessential comment on the team's plight. In a post-game press conference, ''[[Tampa Tribune]]'' sports editor [[Tom McEwen (sportswriter)|Tom McEwen]] asked McKay about the execution of his team's offensive line. McKay responded,{{cquote|I\u2019m in favor of it.}}Another choice quotation that summed up his frustration at the time:{{cquote|We can\u2019t win at home, we can\u2019t win on the road, so we were going to petition the league for a neutral site.}}\n\n[[1977 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|The 1977 season]] started even worse as the Buccaneers were shut out six times. In Week 13 the Bucs finally managed to win their first regular-season game (the team had beaten [[1976 Atlanta Falcons season|the Atlanta Falcons]] 17\u20133 in a 1976 pre-season game), defeating [[1977 New Orleans Saints season|the New Orleans Saints]] on the road 33\u201314. The win was highlighted by three [[interception]]s returned for touchdowns, an NFL record at the time. (The team would later equal this feat 25 years later when they defeated [[2002 Oakland Raiders season|the Oakland Raiders]] in [[Super Bowl XXXVII]].) Saints QB [[Archie Manning]] had said that it would be a disgrace to lose to Tampa Bay, and after the game was over the Buccaneers players taunted him by chanting \u201cIt\u2019s disgraceful!\u201d. Manning to this day disputes the charge that he said this. Others have noted that clever coach McKay may have made the statement up to motivate the team.  After being greeted by 8,000 cheering fans when the team arrived back in Tampa late that evening after the game, the Bucs followed up the victory with a win at home over [[1977 St. Louis Cardinals (NFL) season|the St. Louis Cardinals]] during the final week of the season. Afterwards, a mob of fans ran onto the field and tore down the goalposts.\n\nThe [[1978 NFL season|1978 season]] was [[1978 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|another losing campaign]], but it was highlighted by the presence of [[rookie]] [[quarterback]] [[Doug Williams (quarterback)|Doug Williams]]. Despite a season-ending injury in which his mouth had to be wired shut, he showed enough potential to give Bucs fans hope for the future. His leadership and often electrifying play would transform the team much sooner than anyone expected. Injuries led to a 5\u201311 record, but for the first time the Buccaneers began to resemble a real team.\n\n==A brief period of success (1979 to 1982)==\nThe Bucs\u2019 situation improved rapidly in [[1979 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season| 1979]]. With the maturation of quarterback [[Doug Williams (quarterback)|Doug Williams]], the first 1,000-yard rushing season from running back [[Ricky Bell (running back)|Ricky Bell]], and a smothering, league-leading defense led by future NFL [[Pro Football Hall of Fame|Hall of Famer]] [[Lee Roy Selmon]], the Bucs kicked off the season with five consecutive victories, a stunning performance that landed them on the cover of ''[[Sports Illustrated]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dynamic.si.cnn.com/si_online/covers/issues/1979/1001.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-06-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070612064801/http://dynamic.si.cnn.com/si_online/covers/issues/1979/1001.html |archivedate=2007-06-12 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:1986 Jeno's Pizza - 20 - Cecil Johnson.jpg|thumb|right|The Buccaneers defeated the Eagles in their first playoff appearance in [[1979-80 NFL playoffs|1979]] after suffering three consecutive losing seasons.]]\nWith four games left in the season, the Bucs only needed to win one of them to make the [[1979\u201380 NFL playoffs|playoffs]], and did so in their final contest at home against [[1979 Kansas City Chiefs season|the Kansas City Chiefs]], which was played in the worst downpour in Bucs history. Finishing with a 10\u20136 record, the Bucs had their first winning season, and indeed won the Central Division in a tiebreaker over [[1979 Chicago Bears season|the Chicago Bears]]. In an upset, the Bucs defeated [[1979 Philadelphia Eagles season|the Philadelphia Eagles]] 24\u201317 in the divisional round of [[1979\u201380 NFL playoffs|the playoffs]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dynamic.si.cnn.com/si_online/covers/issues/1980/0107.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-03-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070612064908/http://dynamic.si.cnn.com/si_online/covers/issues/1980/0107.html |archivedate=2007-06-12 }}</ref> Because the [[1979 Los Angeles Rams season|Los Angeles Rams]] defeated the [[1979 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]] in the other NFC playoff game, the Bucs hosted the [[NFC Championship Game]] the following week in Tampa. The Bucs lost to the Rams 9\u20130, thanks to great defense by the Rams. In only their fourth season, the Bucs seemed on the verge of fulfilling McKay's five-year plan.\n\nInjuries plagued the team again [[1980 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|in 1980]], and the Bucs were limited to five wins, ten losses, and one tie against the also injury-plagued [[1980 Green Bay Packers season|Packers]].\n\n[[File:1986 Jeno's Pizza - 19 - Ricky Bell crop.jpg|thumb|left|Bucs' running back Ricky Bell rushing the ball during the 1979 NFC Divisional Playoff Game.]]\nThe Bucs made the [[1981\u201382 NFL playoffs|playoffs]] again despite mediocre performance in [[1981 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|the 1981 season]], winning a weak division and entering the first round during the [[1982 NFL strike|strike-shortened]] [[1982 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|1982 season]]. The 1981 season came down to a thrilling final game at [[1981 Detroit Lions season|Detroit]]. The winner would take the Central Division crown and the loser would miss the playoffs. The Lions had not lost at home all season. Although the Bucs trailed early, an 84-yard touchdown bomb from QB Williams to WR [[Kevin House]] and a fumble recovery for a touchdown by [[David Logan (American football)|David Logan]] sealed the shocking win for the Bucs. [[1981 Dallas Cowboys season|The Dallas Cowboys]] rewarded the Bucs\u2019 efforts with a 38\u20130 blowout in the divisional round of the playoffs.\n\nThe 1982 season started just as poorly, as the Buccaneers went 0\u20133 before a players\u2019 strike shut down the NFL for seven weeks. When the league resumed play, the Bucs were nicknamed the \u201cCardiac Kids\u201d for winning five of their next six games all in the final moments to go 5\u20134 and qualify for the [[1982\u201383 NFL playoffs|expanded playoff slate]]. In the first round, the Bucs once again faced the [[1982 Dallas Cowboys season|Cowboys]] at home in [[Texas Stadium|Dallas]], but the Bucs put up a much better fight, actually leading the game at the half but lost 30-17.\n\nThe Bucs did not return to the playoffs, nor have another non-losing season under Culverhouse's ownership.\n\n==The worst team in the league (1983 to 1996)==\nDoug Williams was the lowest-paid starting quarterback in the NFL during the 1982 season, and his salary of $120,000 was less than several backups. At the end of the season, Williams asked for a raise to $600,000 per season\u2014a reasonable sum at that time, given Williams\u2019 past performance and his market value. However, Culverhouse would not offer more than $400,000 despite McKay's protests. Feeling that Culverhouse was unwilling to pay him a salary befitting his status as an NFL starter, Williams bolted to the [[United States Football League|USFL]], where he played two seasons for [[Arizona Outlaws|the Oklahoma Outlaws]]. Without Williams, the Bucs appeared to be a rudderless team. [[1983 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|The Bucs]] started the [[1983 NFL season|next season]] by losing their first nine games, knocking them out of playoff contention. They finished with a 2\u201314 record, the first of an NFL-record 12 consecutive seasons with ten or more losses. Many Bucs fans blamed Williams\u2019 departure for this seemingly endless streak of futility, and the fact that Williams later returned to the NFL and led [[1987 Washington Redskins season|the Washington Redskins]] to victory in [[Super Bowl XXII]] only deepened the frustration among Bucs fans.\n\nIt can be argued that the team's lengthy woes were primarily due to how Culverhouse ran the organization. Culverhouse kept the team's payroll among the lowest in the league, which prompted few quality players to sign with the team. The ones who did rarely stayed long. Selmon, the Bucs\u2019 first draft pick in 1976 and the first Hall of Famer to have earned his credentials primarily in Tampa Bay, was the only real star who had a long tenure with the team. The Bucs suffered from several missteps in the NFL Draft, the most notorious of which was the team's selection of [[Bo Jackson]] as the #1 overall pick when he openly stated he would never play for them. In [[1977 NFL Draft|the 1977 draft]] the Bucs had passed on future Hall of Fame running back [[Tony Dorsett]] with the No. 1 overall pick in favor of [[Ricky Bell (running back)|Ricky Bell]], who had played for McKay at USC, while they subsequently traded away picks that turned into eventual Hall of Famers [[Dan Hampton]] and [[Irving Fryar]]. The franchise also frequently traded or gave up on quality players who went on to greater success on other teams. The most notable examples were all quarterbacks: Williams; [[Steve Young (American football)|Steve Young]], who was traded to [[1987 San Francisco 49ers season|the San Francisco 49ers]] after the Bucs drafted [[Vinny Testaverde]] first overall in the [[1987 NFL Draft|1987 draft]], only to become a [[Super Bowl MVP]] and [[Pro Football Hall of Fame|Hall of Famer]] with San Francisco; and Testaverde, whom the Bucs let walk to [[1992 Cleveland Browns season|the Cleveland Browns]] via [[Free agent|free agency]] in 1992.\n\nThe front-office woes affected the team regardless of who was brought in to coach. After McKay stepped down at the end of [[1984 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|the 1984 season]], [[Leeman Bennett]], who had coached the [[Atlanta Falcons]] to their first-ever playoff win, was hired.  After two disastrous 2\u201314 seasons, he was replaced by former [[New York Giants]] and [[Alabama Crimson Tide football|University of Alabama]] head coach [[Ray Perkins (wide receiver)|Ray Perkins]]. Perkins brought back much-needed discipline and \u201cthree-a-day\u201d practices, but this proved too much of a good thing.  The team was so physically drained by game day that the losses continued to pile up, and Perkins was fired before the end of [[1990 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|the 1990 season]].  Offensive coordinator [[Richard Williamson (American football)|Richard Williamson]] was elevated to head coach, and after his brief success in the final remaining games, he retained his head coaching position for the following year. The momentum didn\u2019t last, however, and Williamson was fired after [[1991 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|the 1991 season]] when the team went 3\u201313.\n\nLargely due to the Bucs\u2019 wretched showings on the field, attendances were typically among the lowest in the league. Usually, the only times that games attracted crowds anywhere near capacity were when [[History of the Chicago Bears|the Chicago Bears]] and [[History of the Green Bay Packers|Green Bay Packers]] came to town and brought thousands of their fans with them. Both teams had large followings in Tampa Bay due to the large number of Midwestern expatriates in the area. As a result, most Bucs home games were blacked out locally: at one point, 32 home games in a row from 1982 to 1986 \u2013 all or part of five seasons \u2013 were not televised locally.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until the hiring of [[Sam Wyche]] that Bucs fans had reason for optimism. Wyche had coached the Cincinnati Bengals to [[Super Bowl XXIII|a Super Bowl appearance]], when Cincinnati might have won if not for a fourth quarter comeback engineered by 49ers QB [[Joe Montana]]. Wyche did not have immediate success in Tampa, and even his bold \u201cfive-dash-two\u201d (indicating five wins and two losses) declaration in his final season with the Bucs proved premature. However, Wyche deserves credit for drafting three key players who would later prove to be the core of the team's renewed success on defense \u2013 [[Warren Sapp]], [[Derrick Brooks]] and [[John Lynch (American football)|John Lynch]].\n\nThings only really began to change, however, after Culverhouse died of [[lung cancer]] in 1994.\n\n==New ownership, Tony Dungy, and a return to contention (1996 to 2001)==\nDespite the profitability of the Buccaneers in the 1980s, Culverhouse's death revealed a team close to [[bankruptcy]], which surprised many observers. His son, [[Miami, Florida|Miami]] attorney Hugh Culverhouse, Jr., practically forced the trustees of his father's estate to sell the team, which cast doubt on the future of the Buccaneers in Tampa. Interested parties included [[New York Yankees]] owner [[George Steinbrenner]] and [[Baltimore Orioles]] owner [[Peter Angelos]], the latter of whom publicly declared he would move the team to [[Baltimore]],<ref>\u2018NFL: Angelos Makes Tampa Offer \u2013 Oriole Owner Wants Bucs in Baltimore\u2019; ''[[Seattle Times]]'', January 9, 1995, p.

There was also talk of moving the Buccaneers to nearby [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]],<ref>Henderson, Joe; Fay, Bill and Yasinskas, Pat; \u2018Bucs go shopping Orlando officials say it is one of at least two cities the Buccaneers are considering as a new home if a stadium is not built in Tampa\u2019; ''Tampa Tribune'', November 2, 1995, p. 1</ref> but mayor [[Glenda Hood]] ruled out razing the [[Camping World Stadium|Citrus Bowl]] to build an NFL stadium.<ref>\u2018Orlando Won\u2019t Build to Land Bucs\u2019; ''USA Today'', December 3, 1995, p.

Glazer immediately placed his sons [[Bryan Glazer|Bryan]], Edward, and [[Joel Glazer|Joel]] in charge of the team's financial affairs, and the family's deep pockets and serious commitment to fielding a winning team \u2014 in Tampa \u2014 allowed the Bucs to finally become competitive. The team's performance dramatically improved when the Glazers hired [[List of Minnesota Vikings seasons|Minnesota Vikings]] defensive coordinator [[Tony Dungy]] as head coach, jettisoned the old \u201ccreamsicle\u201d uniforms, and convinced [[Hillsborough County, Florida|Hillsborough County]] voters to raise [[sales taxes]] to partially fund the construction of [[Raymond James Stadium]].<ref>\u2018Bucs Gain Support for New Stadium\u2019; ''[[Washington Post]]'', April 2, 1996, p.

However, in the second half of the season they finished 5&ndash;2, primarily due to the performance of a defense ranked seventh in the NFL led by [[Hardy Nickerson]] and the maturing of Wyche's draftees Brooks, Lynch and Sapp.  Dungy, widely renowned for his somber, even-tempered personality, quickly brought balance and morale to the team. [[Defensive coordinator]] [[Monte Kiffin]] developed and refined their trademark [[Tampa 2]] defensive scheme, which became the foundation for Tampa Bay's future success, not to mention a blueprint copied by other teams in the NFL, including [[history of the Chicago Bears|the Chicago Bears]] and [[History of the St. Louis Rams|the St. Louis Rams]].\n\n===The 1997 season: Back to the playoffs===\n{{main article|1997 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season}}\n\nEverything finally came together in [[1997 NFL season|1997]].

In the Bucs\u2019 final home game at [[Houlihan's Stadium]] (formerly Tampa Stadium), the team defeated [[1997 Detroit Lions season|the Detroit Lions]] 20&ndash;10 for only the second playoff win in franchise history. They lost at [[Lambeau Field]] to the eventual NFC champion [[1997 Green Bay Packers season|Green Bay Packers]] 21&ndash;7. Still, there was reason for optimism, and the expectations were high for the following season.\n\n===1998 to 2001: \u201cThe New Sombrero\u201d===\nThe [[1998 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|1998 season]], the first to be played in the newly constructed [[Raymond James Stadium]], saw the [[1998 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|Bucs]] lose several close games en route to a disappointing 8\u20138 record.  The [[1999 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|1999 season]] saw much better fortunes.  On the strength of the NFL's number one overall defense and a surprising performance by rookie QB [[Shaun King (American football)|Shaun King]], the [[1999 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|Bucs]] finished the season with an 11&ndash;5 record and won their third NFC Central championship. They edged the [[1999 Washington Redskins season|Washington Redskins]] 14&ndash;13 in the [[NFL playoffs, 1999\u20132000|Divisional round]], before losing to the eventual Super Bowl champion [[1999 St. Louis Rams season|St. Louis Rams]] in an unusually low-scoring NFC Championship Game, 11&ndash;6.  The Bucs\u2019 loss was controversial, highlighted by the unusual reversal of a pass from King to WR [[Bert Emanuel]].  Despite the fact that Emanuel clearly controlled the ball at every point during the catch, booth replay official [[Jerry Markbreit]] ordered a review of the call. Referee [[Bill Carollo]] determined that the nose of the ball had touched the ground as he brought it into his body.  The resulting reversal all but ended the Bucs' hopes of mounting a game-winning drive. In league meetings later that year, NFL later changed the rules regarding what constituted an [[incomplete pass]], which was a backhanded admission that the reversal was incorrect.\n\n===Offensive woes===\nIn spite of Dungy's success at coaching Tampa Bay into a winner, one of the consistent criticisms from the media and from fans\u2014and later, from players including [[Warren Sapp]]\u2014was that the defense was expected to shoulder too much of the responsibility for winning games.  Beyond fullback [[Mike Alstott]] and running back [[Warrick Dunn]]\u2014who served as a one-two punch ground attack\u2014and [[wide receiver]] [[Keyshawn Johnson]], the team was otherwise underwhelming on offense.  Despite the ongoing criticism, Dungy remained staunchly loyal to his coaching staff, but at the conclusion of the 1999 season, [[General Manager (American football)|general manager]] [[Rich McKay]] forced Dungy to fire [[offensive coordinator]] [[Mike Shula]].  He was replaced by former [[List of Minnesota Vikings seasons|Minnesota Vikings]] and [[List of Tennessee Titans seasons|Tennessee Titans]] offensive coordinator [[Les Steckel]] in 2000, and the result was the Bucs' highest-scoring season ever, another 10&ndash;6 record, and another trip to the playoffs as a wild card. despite his transformation of the team's offense, Steckel's [[drill sergeant]] approach to coaching (he was a [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]] in the [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]]) was a poor fit for the franchise. He was fired at the end of the season, after the Bucs lost 21&ndash;3 to the [[2000 Philadelphia Eagles season|Philadelphia Eagles]].\n\nRather than choose from the pool of strong offensive coordinators available at the end of the 2000 campaign (including former Redskins coach [[Norv Turner]]), Dungy decided to elevate his receivers coach [[Clyde Christensen]] to the position. It can be argued that this controversial decision was the final nail in the coffin for Dungy's tenure. Although the [[2001 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|team]] achieved a 9&ndash;7 winning record in [[2001 NFL season|2001]], they barely made it into the playoffs as the lowest-seeded wild card.  To add insult to injury, the Bucs were once again blown out by the Eagles\u2014this time, 31&ndash;9.\n\nFrustrated with the team's inability to reach the Super Bowl despite a league-dominating defense, Malcolm Glazer fired Dungy the following day\u2014a decision that created more controversy among devoted players and fans.  Despite whatever weaknesses that may have been ascribed to him, Dungy was highly respected around the league as a man of solid character and a coach to whom players were fiercely loyal.  Dungy went on to coach the Colts to the [[Super Bowl XLI]] championship against the [[2006 Chicago Bears season|Chicago Bears]], in the process becoming the first [[African-American]] head coach to win the Super Bowl.\n\n==Jon Gruden, the Super Bowl, and beyond (2002 to 2008)==\nDungy was soon hired as the head coach of [[2002 Indianapolis Colts season|the Indianapolis Colts]], while the Bucs mounted a prolonged and much-maligned search for his replacement.  Several potential candidates were offered the job, including [[Florida Gators football|University of Florida]] head coach [[Steve Spurrier]], [[Bill Parcells]] and [[List of Baltimore Ravens seasons|Baltimore Ravens]] defensive coordinator [[Marvin Lewis]]. Spurrier jumped to the Redskins when he was offered the most lucrative salary package ever offered to an NFL head coach, and Parcells eventually passed on the Bucs\u2019 offer\u2014the second time he had done so in the history of the franchise.  Bucs general manager Rich McKay threw his support behind Lewis, and his hiring appeared so certain that the Ravens held a going-away party for him.<ref>Harry, Chris. [http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2002-02-09/sports/0202090250_1_marvin-lewis-glazers-mckay This is Ridiculous!] ''[[Orlando Sentinel]]'', 2002-02-09.</ref> The Glazer brothers were so displeased with the selection of a yet another defensive-minded coach that they overruled McKay and took control of the candidate search themselves. They made it clear that their top choice was [[Jon Gruden]]. The problem was that he was still under contract to the [[Oakland Raiders]].\n\nWhile talks with the Raiders were secretly underway, the Glazers publicly pursued another respected offensive mind, [[San Francisco 49ers]] head coach [[Steve Mariucci]].  Just when initial reports indicated that Mariucci had agreed to become both the Bucs' head coach and general manager, Raiders owner [[Al Davis]] agreed to release Jon Gruden to Tampa Bay.  Observers suggested that the Glazers' offer to Mariucci was merely a clever bargaining tactic: since Davis' large ego is well documented, it was very likely he wouldn't allow such a blockbuster trade to take place so near his turf.  If the tactic didn't work, then the Bucs would still get the type of head coach the Glazers desired.\n\nThe Glazers\u2019 shrewd move eventually paid off in acquiring Gruden, but it cost the team dearly.  The team hired Gruden away from the Raiders on February 20, 2002, but the price was four [[NFL Draft|draft]] picks, including the Bucs' first and second round picks in 2002, their first round pick in 2003, and their second round selection in 2004, along with $8 million in cash; the league as a result prohibited any further trading of draft picks for coaches. Gruden, who was frustrated by the limitation of his coaching authority by Davis, was more than pleased to return to Tampa Bay, as his parents lived nearby, and he had spent part of his childhood in Tampa in the early 1980s when his father had worked as a Bucs running back coach and director of player personnel.\n\n===The 2002 season: Super Bowl champions===\nUpon his arrival in Tampa, Gruden immediately went to work, acquiring former [[2001 Jacksonville Jaguars season|Jacksonville Jaguars]] WR [[Keenan McCardell]], and RB [[Michael Pittman]] from [[2001 Arizona Cardinals season|the Arizona Cardinals]]. The Bucs needed to improve their sluggish offense, as the league's sweeping realignment sent the Bucs to the new [[NFC South]] division, along with [[2002 Atlanta Falcons season|the Atlanta Falcons]], [[2002 Carolina Panthers season|Carolina Panthers]] and [[2002 New Orleans Saints season|New Orleans Saints]].\n\nThe offensive retooling worked, and combined with the league's top defense, the 2002 campaign was the Buccaneers\u2019 most successful season to date.  They won the NFC South title with a 12\u20134 record\u2014the team's best ever\u2014then defeated the [[2002 San Francisco 49ers season|San Francisco 49ers]] in what became coach [[Steve Mariucci]]\u2019s last game with that franchise. In a surprising upset, the Bucs won their first NFC Championship on the road against the [[2002 Philadelphia Eagles season|Eagles]] in the last NFL game ever played at [[Veterans Stadium]]. [[Cornerback]] [[Ronde Barber]] capped off the win by intercepting a [[Donovan McNabb]] pass and returning it 92 yards for a touchdown late in the fourth quarter. Philadelphia fans could only watch in stunned silence.\n\nThe Bucs went on to rout Gruden\u2019s former team, the [[2002 Oakland Raiders season|Oakland Raiders]], by a score of 48\u201321 in [[Super Bowl XXXVII]]. Gruden\u2019s familiarity with the Raiders\u2019 players and playbook paid off, as [[John Lynch (American football)|John Lynch]] and other Bucs players recognized some of Oakland's formations and plays at crucial points in the game.<ref>http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/inside_game/peter_king/news/2003/02/03/mmqb/</ref> The Bucs became the first team to win the Super Bowl without any picks in the first two rounds of the previous spring's [[2002 NFL Draft|NFL Draft]], having traded these picks to the [[Oakland Raiders]] for the rights to acquire Gruden. Gruden became the youngest head coach to win a Super Bowl.\n\n===2003 and 2004: Front-office tensions===\nSoon after the Super Bowl victory, a growing number of press reports indicated Gruden's lack of patience with general manager McKay. McKay was a major architect of the Bucs rebuilding effort over the previous ten years, and he, like Gruden, had long-established ties to the [[Tampa Bay area]]. However, during the 2003 season, the Gruden-McKay relationship deteriorated as the Bucs struggled on the field. In November, Keyshawn Johnson was deactivated by the team ten games into the season for his conduct, which included sideline arguments with Bucs coaches and players. Johnson was eventually traded to the [[Dallas Cowboys]] for wide receiver [[Joey Galloway]].\n\nJohnson's unusual deactivation was a definitive sign that Gruden had indeed gained control. In December, the Glazers allowed McKay to leave the Bucs before the end of the regular season, and he promptly joined the Falcons as president and general manager. Thus, McKay watched his first game as a Falcons executive sitting next to owner [[Arthur Blank]] in a Raymond James Stadium skybox. The [[2003 Atlanta Falcons season|Falcons]] defeated the [[2003 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|Bucs]] 30\u201328, another sign of how the season had spiraled downward.  Despite opening the season with a Monday night win over the Eagles in Philadelphia's new stadium, [[Lincoln Financial Field]], the Bucs finished the season 7\u20139. Combined with the [[2003 Oakland Raiders season|Raiders']] dismal 4-12 performance, neither Super Bowl team reached the [[2003\u201304 NFL playoffs|playoffs]] that year.\n\nBefore the 2004 training camp, personnel issues and the salary cap became primary concerns. Gruden successfully lobbied the Glazers to hire his former general manager from Oakland, [[Bruce Allen (American football)|Bruce Allen]]. After Allen's arrival in the Bucs' front office, the team announced that it would not resign two of their best defensive players\u2014John Lynch and Warren Sapp\u2014before the regular season even started. Both of their contracts were expiring, and younger players could fill their positions. Lynch was released after medical exams indicated ongoing injury problems. Many Bucs fans were stunned by the move, as Lynch was a very popular player whose aggressive, intelligent play earned him several [[Pro Bowl]] appearances.  He was also well regarded for his philanthropic work in the Tampa Bay area.  Lynch was quickly signed by the [[Denver Broncos]], where he had consecutive injury-free Pro Bowl seasons.  Sapp signed with the Oakland Raiders, where he played in a limited role in 2004, and sat out much of the 2005 season with injuries.  Since wide receiver Keenan McCardell refused to play until he was given a better contract or traded, he was sent to the [[San Diego Chargers]] for draft compensation.\n\nThe distracted Bucs began the [[2004 NFL season|2004 season]] with a 1\u20135 record, their worst start since Gruden arrived.  The fading accuracy of [[placekicker|kicker]] [[Martin Gramatica]] didn't help matters, as the team lost many close games en route to a 5\u201311 record, making the Bucs the first NFL team to follow up a Super Bowl championship with back-to-back losing seasons.  The lone highlights of 2004 were the high-quality play of rookie wide receiver [[Michael Clayton (American football)|Michael Clayton]] and the return of Doug Williams, who joined the Bucs front office as a personnel executive.\n\n===The 2005 season: Another division crown===\n{{main article|2005 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season}}\n\nIn the [[2005 NFL season|2005 season]], the Bucs returned to their winning ways. The Buccaneers selected [[Carnell Williams|Carnell \u201cCadillac\u201d Williams]] in the first round of the [[2005 NFL Draft|2005 draft]], and the rookie would provide a running game the Buccaneers hadn't possessed since the days of [[James Wilder Sr.]] in the 1980s.  Williams set the NFL record for most yards rushing in his first three games with 474, and was named as the AP's 2005 Offensive Rookie of the Year. His shoes and gloves from the third game of the season are now on display in the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]].\n\n<!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:Th 2pts.jpg|frame|right|The replay of the controversial 2-Point Conversion was deemed inconclusive]] -->\nWith their 2005 campaign marking the Buccaneers' 30th Season in the NFL, the team won their first four games before entering a midseason slump hampered by a season-ending injury to starting QB [[Brian Griese]] during a win over the [[2005 Miami Dolphins season|Miami Dolphins]]. Replacement starter [[Chris Simms]] struggled early as the Bucs lost games to the [[2005 San Francisco 49ers season|San Francisco 49ers]] and [[2005 Carolina Panthers season|Carolina Panthers]], but Simms came into his own when he led the team to a last-minute win over the [[2005 Washington Redskins season|Washington Redskins]] in a 36\u201335 thriller to break that slump. In a gutsy move, Gruden went for the win with a [[two-point conversion]] plunge by [[fullback (American football)|fullback]] [[Mike Alstott]].  A booth review of that play was inconclusive, and Redskins coach [[Joe Gibbs]] stated after the game his belief that Alstott had not scored.\n\nThe Bucs followed up with important wins over their NFC South division rivals, sweeping both the [[2005 New Orleans Saints season|New Orleans Saints]] and [[2005 Atlanta Falcons season|Atlanta Falcons]], as well as defeating the Panthers in a rare victory at Carolina.  Even with a tough loss against the [[2005 Chicago Bears season|Chicago Bears]] and a humiliating [[shutout]] against the [[2005 New England Patriots season|New England Patriots]], the Bucs finished 11\u20135 and won the NFC South by virtue of a tie-breaker over the Panthers. The Bucs' 30th Anniversary season would end on a sour note, as they lost 17-10 at home to the Redskins in the wild-card round. A late Bucs touchdown could have tied the game, but the play was ruled incomplete when a [[instant replay|booth review]] upheld the [[Referee (American football)|referee]]\u2019s decision.\n\nThe Bucs sent three veteran players to the [[2006 Pro Bowl]], including cornerback [[Ronde Barber]] and [[Punter (football position)|punter]] [[Josh Bidwell]]. [[Outside linebacker]] [[Derrick Brooks]] was named the Pro Bowl MVP, with a 59-yard interception return for a touchdown.\n\n===2006===\n{{main article|2006 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season}}\n\nAfter winning their division in 2005, the Bucs suffered through an abysmal [[2006 NFL season|2006 season]]. The season was plagued by injuries, with starters such as G [[Dan Buenning]], WR [[Michael Clayton (American football)|Michael Clayton]], RB [[Carnell Williams]], DE [[Simeon Rice]], CB [[Brian Kelly (cornerback)|Brian Kelly]], and QB [[Chris Simms]] all being placed on injured reserve at some point in the season. The season also saw a lot of rookies starting for the Bucs, such as QB [[Bruce Gradkowski]], T [[Jeremy Trueblood]], and G [[Davin Joseph]]. The league schedule was also unfriendly to the Bucs, scheduling them for 3 games (two of them away games) within 11 days of each other. \n\nThere was more to the lost season than just injuries however, as most of the players put on injured reserve had been done so after the team's 0\u20133 start, and offensive shutouts in the first two games in which no touchdowns were scored by the Buccaneers. The departure of several key defensive coaches and assistants didn't bode well with players, who complained to some in the media of not being able to hear coaches in team meetings.\n\nInconsistent and unorganized are how some players referred to one of the newcomers, who most players had a hard time making the transition from long-time favorites [[Rod Marinelli]] and others. Some believe the problems in 2006 were rooted in recent years mistakes, lack of [[salary cap]] room to bring in high impact free agents, lack of top 50 draft picks over the last 5 or 6 years due to trades, and maybe even a failure to properly assess talent resulting in a lack of contribution from second day draft picks in recent history.\n\nThe Bucs started off the season 0\u20133, with QB Chris Simms throwing only one touchdown against seven interceptions. In the third game of the season, a last-minute loss to the [[2006 Carolina Panthers season|Carolina Panthers]], Simms's spleen was ruptured, and he was placed on injured reserve for the rest of the season. After their bye week, the Bucs elected to start rookie quarterback [[Bruce Gradkowski]], a 6th round pick from [[Toledo Rockets football|Toledo]].\n\nGradkowski started off performing decently. People who in hindsight claim the Bucs should have started the more experienced [[Tim Rattay]] forget the Bucs nearly upset the [[2006 New Orleans Saints season|New Orleans Saints]], and then went on to win two narrow victories: one, against the [[2006 Cincinnati Bengals season|Cincinnati Bengals]], winning on an overturned call resulting in a touchdown; and another against the [[Philadelphia Eagles]], thanks to [[Matt Bryant]]\u2019s 62-yard field goal. After these victories, though, Gradkowski\u2019s performance declined. After a 3\u201317 loss to [[2006 New York Giants season|the New York Giants]] in heavy winds, the Bucs proceeded to lose five of their next six games, leading them to a record of 3\u201310 (0\u20136 in their division). In the loss to [[2006 Atlanta Falcons season|the Atlanta Falcons]], Gradkowski was replaced in the 4th quarter by Rattay.\n\nIn the first half of the Bucs\u2019 next game, against the [[2006 Chicago Bears season|Chicago Bears]], Gradkowski was again replaced by Rattay, who led the team from a 24\u20133 deficit to a score of 31\u201331, with three touchdowns in the fourth quarter. However, the Bucs then lost the game in overtime, 34\u201331. Rattay was then named the new starting quarterback for the last two games for the season. The Bucs finished their season with a 4\u201312 record, tied for third worst in the NFL.\n\nThe Bucs sent three players to the [[2007 Pro Bowl]], cornerback [[Ronde Barber]], tight end/long snapper [[Dave Moore (American football player)|Dave Moore]] (A \u201cNeed\u201d player according to Saints coach [[Sean Payton]]), and late addition outside linebacker [[Derrick Brooks]] (as an injury replacement). This would be Brooks' 10th consecutive Pro Bowl and 10th Pro Bowl overall.\n\n===2007: A return to grace===\n2007 began well for the Buccaneers, as they made a splash in the off season signing veteran quarterback [[Jeff Garcia]], linebackers [[Cato June]] and [[Patrick Chukwurah]], and former New York Jets fullback [[B.J. Askew]]. However, they suffered heavy losses also, releasing three-time pro bowl defensive end [[Simeon Rice]] and starting middle linebacker [[Shelton Quarles]], both of whom spent the majority of their career in Tampa Bay. Further disappointment came in the form of a neck injury sustained by 6-time pro bowler and 12-year veteran fullback [[Mike Alstott]] in a preseason match against the [[New England Patriots]]. The injury placed Alstott on injured reserve for the rest of the season, and ultimately led to his retirement in January 2008.\n\nThe [[2007 NFL season|regular season]] began with a crushing 20\u20136 loss to the [[2007 Seattle Seahawks season|Seattle Seahawks]] in [[Qwest Field]]. But by week 6 the Bucs had turned their fortunes around and had a record of 4\u20132, including home victories against division rivals the [[2007 Carolina Panthers season|Carolina Panthers]] and the [[2007 New Orleans Saints season|New Orleans Saints]]. Running Back Carnell \u201cCadillac\u201d Williams suffered a season-ending torn [[patellar tendon]] in a week 4 home victory over the Panthers, which contributed to a 33-14 blowout loss to former Bucs head coach Tony Dungy's [[2007 Indianapolis Colts season|Indianapolis Colts]] the next week. The Buccaneers' misfortune against non-divisional teams was countered as the season progressed by their domination of the [[NFC South]]. In week 15, [[Micheal Spurlock]] recorded the first ever kick return touchdown ever scored by a Tampa Bay Buccaneer in a home victory against the [[2007 Atlanta Falcons season|Atlanta Falcons]]. They won all but one of their divisional games and, at the peak of their success, had a record of 9\u20135. Many factors contributed to this, such as the problems faced by Atlanta, whose star quarterback [[Michael Vick]] had been arrested on dog fighting charges in the preseason, and the season-ending [[Anterior cruciate ligament|ACL]] tear suffered by New Orleans running back [[Deuce McAllister]]. they finished off the season on a low point, however, but still won the NFC South division, and qualified for a [[2007\u201308 NFL playoffs|playoff spot]] at 9\u20137.\n\nTampa Bay were set to host the [[2007 New York Giants season|New York Giants]] at Raymond James Stadium for their second home playoff game in three seasons. They began well opening up the scoreboard with the first touchdown of the game, which was a 1-yard [[Earnest Graham]] run. However, the Giants outscored the Bucs 24-0 until the last three minutes of play, when Jeff Garcia completed a touchdown pass to [[Alex Smith]] to bring the Bucs back to just a ten-point deficit, although an interception by [[R.W. McQuarters]] with two minutes left, sealed the victory for Giants. In the end the Buccaneers had been held to 271 yards of total offense and 3 turnovers, and lost the game 24\u201314.\n\n===2008===\nOn January 28, the Buccaneers re-signed head coach Jon Gruden and GM Bruce Allen through the 2011 season. Also during the offseason, the Buccaneers expressed interest in acquiring QB Brett Favre from Green Bay, but he eventually signed with the New York Jets instead. The 2008 regular season began with a loss to New Orleans, followed by three wins, a loss to Denver, two more wins, a defeat in Dallas, and four wins over the Chiefs, Vikings, Lions, and Saints. At 9\u20133, the Buccaneers were close to guaranteeing their place in the playoffs, with 4 games remaining in the season. However, they fell to Carolina on Monday Night Football, which ended their chances of successfully repeating as division champions. They next lost to Atlanta in overtime, followed by their first home loss of the season to San Diego.\n\nThe final week of the season still held playoff hopes, although it would take a Buccaneers win over Oakland coupled with a Dallas loss. The Buccaneers couldn't hold their 4th quarter lead against the Raiders, and lost 31\u201324. Adding insult to injury, Dallas lost their final game against Philadelphia, giving the Eagles the final wild card playoff spot over Dallas and the Bucs. Having finished 9\u20137 and missing the playoffs, Jon Gruden was fired January 16, 2009, almost one year to the date he received a contract-extension. GM Bruce Allen was fired on the same date as well. This would usher in a wholesale change of coaches and players leading up to the 2009 season, with [[Raheem Morris]] being elevated to head coach on January 17.\n\n==A Coaching Carousel and Out of the Playoffs (2009 onwards)==\n===Raheem Morris era (2009 to 2011)===\n===2009===\nAlthough the 2008 season was a disappointment, 2009 would prove a disaster for the Buccaneers. The team lost seven consecutive matches, including an international series game with New England in London. Finally, in Week 9, the team donned its orange-and-white throwback uniforms and hosted the Packers. Green Bay was struggling with a weak O-line, and the Buccaneers swept to victory 38\u201328 after a pair of touchdown passes by rookie QB [[Josh Freeman]]. Afterwards, the losses resumed as Tampa Bay dropped four games in a row against Miami, New Orleans, Atlanta, Carolina, and New York before they brought down Seattle in Week 15, followed by New Orleans. The team lost the season ender against Atlanta to finish 3\u201313.\n\n===2010===\nThe poor 2009 record of Tampa Bay was in part due to a youthful, inexperienced team (barring a few exceptions such as 35-year-old CB Ronde Barber, the last remaining member of the 2002 Super Bowl team), and it was hoped that they would improve with time. The Buccaneers got off to a 2\u20130 start in 2010 by beating Cleveland and Carolina, but both proved weak opponents and they could never handle Pittsburgh, a team only two years removed from its 2008 Super Bowl win, losing 38\u201313. Following their bye week, they beat the Bengals in Cincinnati 24\u201321.  After the road victory in Cincinnati, the Bucs came home to face the defending Super Bowl champion Saints, who were struggling after a loss to the Arizona Cardinals in which the Cardinals did not score an offensive touchdown, but capitalized on New Orleans turnovers.  A victory would have helped the Bucs towards first place in the NFC South; however, they were blown out 31\u20136.  The next week saw another home deficit against the St. Louis Rams with the Bucs trailing 6\u201317 at halftime.  Strong defense shut down the Rams\u2019 offense in the second half, and with two field goals and a late touchdown pass to Carnell \u201cCadillac\u201d Williams, the Bucs topped the Rams 18\u201317.  After the game with the team standing at 4\u20132, head coach Raheem Morris would famously state, \u201cWe\u2019re the best team in the NFC.\u201d<ref>http://www.pewterreport.com/index.php?option=com_k2&view=item&id=6262:morris-explains-best-team-in-nfc-remark</ref>  The following week, the Bucs would make good on Morris's claim by defeating the Arizona Cardinals on the road in a game where they led 31\u201314,  fell behind late 35\u201331, then retook the lead 38\u201335 and sealed the victory with an [[Aqib Talib]] interception of Cardinals quarterback [[Derek Anderson (American football)|Derek Anderson]] near the end zone.  With the Bucs and the Atlanta Falcons tied for first place in the division at 5\u20132, a matchup in Atlanta gave the Bucs a chance to take sole possession of first place.  Trailing 27\u201314 in the second half, Bucs returner Micheal Spurlock returned a Falcons kickoff for a touchdown to put the Bucs within a touchdown of the lead.  The game came down to fourth down attempt to score from the Falcons 1 yard-line. Rookie running back [[LeGarrette Blount]] was stopped up the middle and gave the Falcons the close victory.  Following the tough loss, the Bucs came home and defeated the Carolina Panthers 31\u201316 before going on the road against the San Francisco 49ers and pitching a 21\u20130 shutout.  The next week, the Bucs road game against [[2010 Baltimore Ravens season|the Baltimore Ravens]], their fourth game away from Raymond James Stadium in five weeks, was moved to a late start, and the Bucs lost a hard-fought defensive struggle 17\u201310. Finally returning home the next week, the team sported their throwback creamsicle uniforms and honored coach John McKay at halftime in a home contest against the Falcons on national television. With a great defensive performance and two interceptions of Falcons quarterback [[Matt Ryan (American football)|Matt Ryan]], it seemed the Bucs would get revenge on the Falcons for their loss four weeks ago, leading 24\u201314 deep in the second half.  But Falcons returner [[Eric Weems]] returned a kick for a touchdown and the Falcons scored offensively to take a 28\u201324 lead.  Quarterback Josh Freeman attempted the late comeback as he had against the Browns, Bengals, Rams, and Cardinals, but was denied with a [[Brent Grimes]] interception.  At 7\u20135, the Bucs\u2019 playoff hopes seemed less assured, and the team had yet to defeat an opponent with a winning record, while several key starters had been lost for the season.  In a rainy outing at Washington, the Bucs prevailed 17\u201316 thanks to a botched extra-point attempt by the Redskins, but lost to the Detroit Lions at home in overtime to break the Lions' historic road losing streak.  Needing help to make the playoffs as a wild-card team, the Bucs routed the eventual NFC West champion Seattle Seahawks 38\u201315 in Tampa.  With the last week of the regular season on the slate, the Bucs needed to defeat the New Orleans Saints in the [[Louisiana Superdome|Superdome]], then hope for the defeats of the Green Bay Packers and the New York Giants by the Chicago Bears and Washington Redskins, respectively, as both teams held playoff tiebreakers over the Buccaneers.  The Saints planned to fight the Bucs equally hard, as a victory and a Falcons loss to the Carolina Panthers would give them the #1 seed in the NFC.  The game was close and hard-fought throughout the first half, but two key turnovers by the Bucs defense, a [[Barrett Ruud]] forced fumble of Saints running back [[Julius Jones]] near the Bucs' goal line and an interception of Saints quarterback [[Drew Brees]] near the end of the half, gave the Bucs the slight edge.  A Saints field goal in the fourth quarter cut the Tampa Bay lead to 20\u201313, but with the Falcons holding a large lead over the Panthers, Saints coach [[Sean Payton]] chose to sit Brees and put in backup [[Chase Daniel]].  The Bucs held on and won the game 23\u201313,<ref>http://espn.go.com/nfl/team/schedule/_/name/tb/year/2010/tampa-bay-buccaneers</ref> finishing the season with a 10\u20136 record, their best since 2005.  However, the Packers and Giants both won close games as well, thus sending the eventual Super Bowl champion Packers to the playoffs.  For the second time in three years, the Bucs had finished with a winning record, yet missed the playoffs.  The season marked a 7-game improvement over the previous one, and was highlighted by the superb play of second-year quarterback Josh Freeman and a strong rookie class led by [[Gerald McCoy]], [[Arrelious Benn]], [[Mike Williams (wide receiver, born 1987)|Mike Williams]], [[Cody Grimm]], and [[LeGarrette Blount]].  No Buccaneers were selected to the Pro Bowl, but left tackle [[Donald Penn]] did play in the game as a replacement for Green Bay's [[Chad Clifton]], marking Penn's first appearance.  Raheem Morris finished second in AP NFL Coach of the Year voting, and Mike Williams finished second in Offensive Rookie of the Year voting.\n\n===2011===\nThe Buccaneers went into 2011 with high expectations, but they ended up not materializing. Things began on an ominous note when they lost at home in Week 1 to the Lions, who had beaten them the previous December and denied them a playoff appearance. At the bye in Week 7, the Bucs were 4\u20133 and looked promising to make a postseason push. All of that changed rapidly when they abruptly collapsed and ended up not winning another game for the rest of the season for the longest losing streak in franchise history since 1977. On January 2, 2012, Morris was fired as head coach of the Buccaneers after a 4\u201312 season, including losing their last ten games.<ref>{{cite news |title=Bucs fire coach Raheem Morris |url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/7413905/tampa-bay-buccaneers-fire-coach-raheem-morris-10-game-losing-skid |publisher=[[ESPN.com]] |date=January 2, 2012 |accessdate=2012-01-02}}</ref>\n\n===2012 and 2013: Greg Schiano era===\n[[File:JaguarsBucs2011.JPG|thumbnail|left|The Bucs vs the [[Jacksonville Jaguars]]]]\nAbout three weeks after firing [[Raheem Morris]], the Buccaneers hired [[Greg Schiano]] from [[Rutgers Scarlet Knights football|Rutgers]] as the new head coach. During his introductory conference he stated \u201cThere will be Buccaneer men, and there will be a Buccaneer Way.\u201d The phrase ''\u201cThe Buccaneer Way\u201d'' became a slogan amongst fans and local media, describing the new regime and attitude. The team filled out the coaching staff with new faces, including [[Mike Sullivan (American football coach)|Mike Sullivan]], [[Bill Sheridan]], and [[Butch Davis]]. In 2013, [[Dave Wannstedt]] was also added as special teams coach. In the first day of free agency, the club signed top prospects [[Vincent Jackson]] and [[Carl Nicks (American football)|Carl Nicks]], as well as [[Eric Wright (cornerback, born 1985)|Eric Wright]]. The $140 million committed to the team during that 24-hour period is considered the largest investment the Glazer family has put into the team going back almost a decade.\n\nThe team would finish the [[2012 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|2012 season]] at 7\u20139, notably ranking first in rushing defense. Furthermore, the rushing offense was highlighted by the breakout performance of [[Doug Martin (running back)|Doug Martin]]. After two seasons of game day local television blackouts, the improved team began seeing increased attendance and attention, and some blackouts lifted. Six games were blacked out in 2012. For the three-year period of 2010-2012 the Bucs led the NFL in local television blackouts with 19 (Cincinnati was second with 11).  Schiano's strict and regimented coaching style, however, drew criticism at the end of the game against the Giants, ordering his defense to continue to aggressively tackle the offense as the quarterback was taking a knee to end the game.\n\nComing into the [[2013 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|2013 season]], fans and analysts had better than average expectations for Tampa Bay. They were expected to improve their record, and potentially make a playoffs run. The predictions proved unfounded, as numerous issues on and off the field saw the team collapse. During training camp, a reported rift began to divide Schiano and quarterback Josh Freeman. After an 0\u20133 start, Freeman was benched, and ultimately released. Schiano started rookie [[Mike Glennon]], but the team continued to lose. The fans' confidence of Schiano began to decay rapidly, and after an 0\u20138 start, the team finally got its first win of the season on a Monday night against Miami. A brief win streak saw improvements with Glennon at quarterback, and [[Bobby Rainey]] took over at running back with stellar numbers after [[Doug Martin (running back)|Doug Martin]] went down with a shoulder injury. There were no blackouts in 2013, as the Glazers bought up the necessary tickets for two of the games to get to the 85% threshold needed to prevent local blackouts.\n\nDespite some individual improvements, and some impressive performances by members of the defense, the team dropped the last three games of the season, and finished 4\u201312. The team ranked last or near the bottom in almost every offensive category. On December 30, 2013, Schiano and general manager [[Mark Dominik]] were fired.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/eye-on-football/24391908/report-greg-schiano-and-gm-mark-dominik-fired-by-buccaneers|title=Greg Schiano and GM Mark Dominik fired by Buccaneers|publisher=[[CBS Sports]]|date=December 30, 2013|accessdate=December 30, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===2014 and 2015: Lovie Smith and Jason Licht era===\n[[File:Buccaneers at Browns 2014.jpg|thumb|right|2014 marked the first season under coach Lovie Smith.]]\nOn January 1, 2014, [[Lovie Smith]] was hired as the new head coach of the Buccaneers, replacing [[Greg Schiano]]. Smith had previously spent 5 seasons with the Buccaneers from 1996 to 2001 coaching the linebackers under [[Tony Dungy]]. During his first news conference with the Bucs, Smith talked about restoring the quality of the team from the late 1990s and early 2000s: \u201cThere was a certain brand of football you expected from us\u201d, Smith said. \u201cYou know we would be relentless. There was a brand of football that you got from us each week at Raymond James Stadium. It was hard for opponents to come in and win. We have gotten away from that a little bit, and it\u2019s time ... for us to become a relevant team again.\"\n\nOn January 21, 2014, [[Jason Licht]] was hired as the new general manager, replacing [[Mark Dominik]]. He was officially introduced at One Buc Place on January 23, 2014. In his first news conference, Licht talked about his philosophy:{{cquote|Our philosophy is going to be to build through the draft. That\u2019s where we find our stars. That\u2019s where we find the next generation. But also in the short term and long term we\u2019re going to supplement our roster through free agency but we\u2019re going to look for value. We\u2019re going to spend wisely.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Brown|first1=Rick|title=Licht: Building Through the Draft and Free Agency|url=http://bucsscene.blogs.theledger.com/14780/licht-building-through-the-draft-and-free-agency/|website=TheLedger.com|accessdate=June 23, 2014|date=January 23, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150910021320/http://bucsscene.blogs.theledger.com/14780/licht-building-through-the-draft-and-free-agency/|archive-date=September 10, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>}}\n\nReflecting the team's fresh start, the Buccaneers began to wear new uniforms for the [[2014 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|2014 season]].<ref name=\"NewUniDesign2014\">{{cite web|title=New Uniform Design Unveiled|url=http://www.buccaneers.com/news/article-1/New-Uniform-Design-Unveiled/b8944519-d276-482a-a9e7-d800fabb9401|publisher=Tampa Bay Buccaneers|date=March 3, 2014|accessdate=July 14, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140310183136/http://www.buccaneers.com/news/article-1/New-Uniform-Design-Unveiled/b8944519-d276-482a-a9e7-d800fabb9401|archive-date=March 10, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nAfter signing veteran free agent [[Josh McCown]] and many more free agents, many analysts predicted that the Buccaneers could be the surprise team of the year and possibly make a playoff run. Those predictions soon went away after the Bucs began the season 0\u20133, including a 56\u201314 blowout against [[2014 Atlanta Falcons season|the Atlanta Falcons]] on Thursday Night Football. McCown was injured in that game, and second year quarterback [[Mike Glennon]] was named the starter. His first start of the 2014 season ended with the Bucs earning their first victory of the season in Pittsburgh against the Steelers 27\u201324. The Bucs lost the next 4 games, two overtime loses against [[2014 New Orleans Saints season|the New Orleans Saints]] and [[2014 Minnesota Vikings season|the Minnesota Vikings]], one blowout against [[2015 Baltimore Ravens season|the Baltimore Ravens]] and a 5-point loss against [[2014 Cleveland Browns season|the Cleveland Browns]]. Going into week 10 at 1\u20138, McCown returned as the starter. Mathematically, the Bucs were still in playoff contention only being 3 games out of first place in the division. McCown's first game back ended with a 27\u201317 loss to the Falcons but won the following week in a 27\u20137 blowout against the struggling [[2014 Washington Redskins season|Washington Redskins]]. The Bucs would lose the next three games and were officially knocked out of playoff contention in week 14. The Bucs would finish 2\u201314, winning two fewer games than the previous season and securing the first-overall draft pick in the [[2015 NFL draft]].\n\nDespite the team's record, first-round draft pick wide receiver [[Mike Evans (wide receiver)|Mike Evans]] had more than 1,000 receiving yards and he became the youngest NFL player to record more than 200 receiving yards in a single game. Vincent Jackson also had more than 1,000 yards receiving, which represented Tampa Bay's first pair of 1,000 yard receivers in a season. Second-year CB Johnthan Banks led the team with 4 interceptions and had 50 tackles. Danny Lansanah flourished in the Tampa 2 system with 81 tackles, 1.5 QB sacks, and 3 interceptions, with 2 of those interceptions returned for touchdowns for the 2014 season. Jacquies Smith, who was signed from Buffalo after waiving rookie DE Scott Solomon a month into the season, had 17 combined tackles, 13 solo tackles, 6.5 sacks, and 1 forced fumble in only 8 starts for 2014.\n\nAfter the conclusion of the 2014 season, Tampa Bay hired [[Ben Steele]] to become the team's new offensive quality control coach as well as former [[Atlanta Falcons]] offensive coordinator, [[Dirk Koetter]], to be their new offensive coordinator after parting ways with QB coach and interim offensive coordinator [[Marcus Arroyo]]. Having a 2\u201314 record, tied for worst in the NFL, Tampa gained the 1st overall pick in the 2015 NFL draft. They also made some headlines when they released QB [[Josh McCown]] on February 11, 2015 to save $5.25 million in cap space. With the first overall pick in the NFL draft, the Buccaneers selected [[Jameis Winston]] from Florida State. Throughout the offseason, there was much debate whether the Buccaneers should pick Jameis, or Oregon QB [[Marcus Mariota]].\n\nOn January 6, 2016, Smith was fired by the Buccaneers after posting a record of 8\u201324 in his two seasons, including a 6\u201310 record in the 2015 season.\n\n=== 2016-2018: Dirk Koetter era ===\nOn January 15, 2016, Dirk Koetter was promoted from Offensive Coordinator to become the new head coach of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. <ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.buccaneers.com/news/dirk-koetter-named-buccaneers-head-coach-16700643|title=Dirk Koetter Named Buccaneers Head Coach |date=January 15, 2016|publisher=Buccaneers.com}}</ref>\n\nInitially the Buccaneers had success with Koetter as their head coach when they finished 9-7 for their first winning season since 2010. However, the Buccaneers would only win ten games in the next two seasons; and on December 30, 2018, the Buccaneers would fire Koetter as their head coach. <ref>{{cite news|url=https://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2018/12/30/report-dirk-koetter-fired-by-buccaneers/|title=Dirk Koetter fired by Buccaneers |date=December 30, 2018|publisher=PFT}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n{{Tampa Bay Buccaneers}}\n{{NFL team history}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:History Of The Tampa Bay Buccaneers}}\n[[Category:Tampa Bay Buccaneers]]\n[[Category:History of Tampa, Florida|Tampa Bay Buccaneers]]\n[[Category:National Football League history by team|Tampa Bay Buccaneers]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: didn\u2019t \u2192 didn't (2), 17-10 \u2192 17\u201310, 30-17 \u2192 30\u201317", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Tampa_Bay_Buccaneers"}
