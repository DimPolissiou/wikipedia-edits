It is one of the governing parties for the [[Caltrain]] commuter rail line that serves the county.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Santa Clara VTA logo.svg|thumb|VTA's old logo, which was used from December 1996 to January 2017.]]\n\n===Founding of Santa Clara County Transit District===\nIn 1969, Santa Clara County had three private bus companies, all of which were in serious financial trouble: Peninsula Transit, San Jose [[National City Lines|City Lines]], and Peerless Stages.{{sfnp|McCaleb|1994|p=12}} The [[California Legislature]] passed a Santa Clara County Transit District Act in 1969.{{sfnp|McCaleb|1994|p=12}} However, the Act did not supply any funding for the new district. The formation of the Santa Clara County Transit District was rejected in 1969 and 1970 before it was finally approved by county voters on June 6, 1972.{{sfnp|McCaleb|1994|p=12}} The SCCTD took over the operations of the three old bus companies on January 1, 1973.{{sfnp|McCaleb|1994|p=12}}\n\nOn September 26, 1974, the county Board of Supervisors dissolved the Public Works Department.{{sfnp|McCaleb|1994|p=16}} Non-transit operations went into a new General Services Agency, while transit operations were placed into a new Santa Clara County Transportation Agency.{{sfnp|McCaleb|1994|p=16}}\n\nIn its early years the Santa Clara County Transportation District approached the task of replacing the bus fleet it inherited from its predecessors, which was in need of upgrades and repair.

In 1977, the primary Overhaul and Repair Facility was built at the Cerone Yard. Also in 1977, County Supervisors decided to change the bus fleet from propane to diesel and ordered 102 buses.

In December 1978, the SCCTD approved an [[affirmative action]] plan for the Transportation Agency. After a long legal battle, the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] by a 6-3 majority upheld the [[gender]] component of the plan against a [[civil rights]] challenge on March 25, 1987.<ref>{{ussc|name=Johnson v.

For convenience, the acronym was later shortened to VTA.\n\nIn 1996, voters approved a half-cent general county sales tax, Measure B, and a companion list of transportation projects recommended to be funded with Measure B, called '''(1996) Measure A'''. The two measures were designed to adhere to the rule in the [[California Constitution|California State Constitution]] that requires a two-thirds [[supermajority]] to pass any special purpose sales tax, but only a majority vote to pass a general sales tax. The measure was challenged, but in 1998, the [[California Supreme Court]] ruled that the two measure system was valid.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sccgov.org/measureb/about.htm |title=Measure B Transportation Improvement Program (PRG) |publisher=County of Santa Clara }}{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The tax was to be collected for ten years.\n\n====2000 Measure A and VTA's BART Silicon Valley Extension====\nIn 2000, voters approved a 30-year extension of the 1996 [[sales tax]] to fund the [[Silicon Valley BART extension]], which will eventually extend [[Bay Area Rapid Transit]] from its prior terminus in Fremont to [[Santa Clara, California|Santa Clara]]. '''2000 Measure A''' also includes funding for light rail extensions, bus service expansion, expansion and [[Electrification of Caltrain|electrification of Caltrain service]],<ref name=\"vta.org\">http://www.vta.org/2000_measure_a/index.html</ref> and connections from [[San Jose International Airport]] to [[BART]], [[Caltrain]] and VTA light rail. The measure was placed on the ballot by the VTA and does not include funding specifically for highway projects. The measure passed with 70% of the vote. Revenues from the sales tax would not begin being collected until April 2006.\n\nAfter 2000, due to the [[dot-com bubble|dot-com bust]], existing revenue sources declined and VTA was forced to cut service and increase fares. VTA introduced a series of fare increases between 1998 and 2005.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.vtaridersunion.org/ffa/farechange1996-2005.html |title= History of VTA Fare Hikes - 1996 to 2005 |accessdate= 2008-03-30 |publisher= Santa Clara VTA Riders Union |year= 2005 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080217002432/http://www.vtaridersunion.org/ffa/farechange1996-2005.html |archive-date= 2008-02-17 |url-status= dead }}</ref> VTA's [[Farebox recovery ratio|farebox recovery]] is approximately 13% and the Authority is focused on increasing the ratio.

In this role VTA makes decisions on what local projects can utilize federal and state funding, and manage sales tax revenue that is specified for VTA usages, such as '''1987 Measure A''' and '''2000 Measure A''' sales tax measures.\n\n==Transit services==\nVTA operates three [[light rail]] lines, a number of [[bus]] lines, and [[paratransit]] service. VTA is a member agency of [[Peninsula Corridor Joint Powers Board]] that manages [[Caltrain]] commuter rail, providing one-third of annual operating funds and all the funding for specific improvement projects within Santa Clara County. VTA is also a member agency of Capitol Corridor Joint Powers Authority that manages [[Capitol Corridor]] intercity rail service.\n\nAs VTA covers Santa Clara County in general, it serves the major core city of [[San Jose, California|San Jose]] (where VTA is based and headquartered), with service to the other municipalities of [[Campbell, California|Campbell]], [[Cupertino, California|Cupertino]], [[Gilroy, California|Gilroy]], [[Los Altos, California|Los Altos]], [[Los Altos Hills, California|Los Altos Hills]], [[Los Gatos, California|Los Gatos]], [[Milpitas, California|Milpitas]], [[Monte Sereno, California|Monte Sereno]], [[Morgan Hill, California|Morgan Hill]], [[Mountain View, California|Mountain View]], [[Palo Alto, California|Palo Alto]], [[Santa Clara, California|Santa Clara]], [[Saratoga, California|Saratoga]] and [[Sunnyvale, California|Sunnyvale]]. Only Campbell, Milpitas, Mountain View, San Jose, Santa Clara and Sunnyvale are served by light rail.

Line 22 is the only line with 24-hour, 7 days-per-week service, including [[night bus service]] as part of the regional [[All-Nighter Network]].

Modeled after the [[Metro Rapid]] service in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], rapid bus Line 522 follows most of the Line 22 route, and features limited stops, headway based schedules, low floor fleet, and signal priority along El Camino Real. However, the current rapid bus service by VTA does not fully qualify as BRT, due to the lack of separate ticketing stations and platforms, distinctive vehicles, and special lanes (which make BRT mimic more of a light rail or tram route, instead of a bus route). Rather, it serves as a temporary rapid bus service until VTA officially opens a BRT transit corridor along the same route, which will upgrade the current 522 route.\n\n====Future====\n{{Santa Clara\u2013Alum Rock|collapse=yes}}\n{{update-section|date=March 2017}}\nVTA plans to add distinctive vehicles, separate bus-exclusive lanes on Alum Rock Avenue, El Camino Real, and Stevens Creek Road, ticketing platforms separate from other buses, and possible amentities such as wait time for successive BRT buses by 2016 (making BRT behave more like a light rail or tram system, instead of bus service). This would also upgrade the existing 522 bus service to official BRT, and rename the entire VTA-operated BRT service to VTA Rapid, differentiating it from VTA's buses division.\n\nVTA plans to split BRT into three separate lines. Construction is expected to commence in 2012, complete in 2013 on the line going east from SAP Center to [[Eastridge Center|Eastridge Mall]] via Santa Clara/Alum Rock, and in 2015 on the second line, which will go from SAP Center to Palo Alto along the El Camino Real. VTA will also construct a similar additional route along a third line, which will run from downtown San Jose to De Anza College on the Stevens Creek corridor (complementing regular route 23 service). This route is scheduled to open in 2017. Buses will operate with five-minute headways on the line east of SAP Center, and on ten-minute headways west of SAP Center.<ref>http://www.vta.org/valleyrapid/faqs/index.html</ref>\n\n===Paratransit===\n[[Paratransit]] service is door-to-door shuttle service available to disabled people that meet the requirements of the 1990 [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990]]. [http://www.mvtransit.com/ MV Transportation ], a for profit agency, is the contract paratransit broker for VTA.\n\n===Future SJC\u2013Diridon\u2013DAC connector===\nVTA released a request for information in July 2019 to solicit concepts for a grade-separated system that would connect [[Diridon Station]] with the [[San Jose International Airport]] (SJC), a distance of approximately {{convert|3|mi}}.

In December 1978, the SCCTD approved an [[affirmative action]] plan for the Transportation Agency.

For convenience, the acronym was later shortened to VTA.\n\nIn 1996, voters approved a half-cent general county sales tax, Measure B, and a companion list of transportation projects recommended to be funded with Measure B, called '''(1996) Measure A'''. The two measures were designed to adhere to the rule in the [[California Constitution|California State Constitution]] that requires a two-thirds [[supermajority]] to pass any special purpose sales tax, but only a majority vote to pass a general sales tax. The measure was challenged, but in 1998, the [[California Supreme Court]] ruled that the two measure system was valid.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sccgov.org/measureb/about.htm |title=Measure B Transportation Improvement Program (PRG) |publisher=County of Santa Clara }}{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The tax was to be collected for ten years.\n\n====2000 Measure A and VTA's BART Silicon Valley Extension====\nIn 2000, voters approved a 30-year extension of the 1996 [[sales tax]] to fund the [[Silicon Valley BART extension]], which will eventually extend [[Bay Area Rapid Transit]] from its prior terminus in Fremont to [[Santa Clara, California|Santa Clara]].

The measure was placed on the ballot by the VTA and does not include funding specifically for highway projects. The measure passed with 70% of the vote. Revenues from the sales tax would not begin being collected until April 2006.\n\nAfter 2000, due to the [[dot-com bubble|dot-com bust]], existing revenue sources declined and VTA was forced to cut service and increase fares. VTA introduced a series of fare increases between 1998 and 2005.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.vtaridersunion.org/ffa/farechange1996-2005.html |title= History of VTA Fare Hikes - 1996 to 2005 |accessdate= 2008-03-30 |publisher= Santa Clara VTA Riders Union |year= 2005 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080217002432/http://www.vtaridersunion.org/ffa/farechange1996-2005.html |archive-date= 2008-02-17 |url-status= dead }}</ref> VTA's [[Farebox recovery ratio|farebox recovery]] is approximately 13% and the Authority is focused on increasing the ratio.

In this role VTA makes decisions on what local projects can utilize federal and state funding, and manage sales tax revenue that is specified for VTA usages, such as '''1987 Measure A''' and '''2000 Measure A''' sales tax measures.\n\n==Transit services==\nVTA operates three [[light rail]] lines, a number of [[bus]] lines, and [[paratransit]] service. VTA is a member agency of [[Peninsula Corridor Joint Powers Board]] that manages [[Caltrain]] commuter rail, providing one-third of annual operating funds and all the funding for specific improvement projects within Santa Clara County. VTA is also a member agency of Capitol Corridor Joint Powers Authority that manages [[Capitol Corridor]] intercity rail service.\n\nAs VTA covers Santa Clara County in general, it serves the major core city of [[San Jose, California|San Jose]] (where VTA is based and headquartered), with service to the other municipalities of [[Campbell, California|Campbell]], [[Cupertino, California|Cupertino]], [[Gilroy, California|Gilroy]], [[Los Altos, California|Los Altos]], [[Los Altos Hills, California|Los Altos Hills]], [[Los Gatos, California|Los Gatos]], [[Milpitas, California|Milpitas]], [[Monte Sereno, California|Monte Sereno]], [[Morgan Hill, California|Morgan Hill]], [[Mountain View, California|Mountain View]], [[Palo Alto, California|Palo Alto]], [[Santa Clara, California|Santa Clara]], [[Saratoga, California|Saratoga]] and [[Sunnyvale, California|Sunnyvale]]. Only Campbell, Milpitas, Mountain View, San Jose, Santa Clara and Sunnyvale are served by light rail. Express bus service is provided to nearby [[Fremont, California|Fremont]] where it connects with BART; it partners with [[Highway 17 Express]] to provide service to [[Santa Cruz, California|Santa Cruz]] and partners with [[Dumbarton Express]] to provide transbay service between [[Union City, California|Union City]] and [[Stanford University]].\n\n===Light rail===\n{{Main|Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority light rail}}\n[[Image:VTA Tasman Station (August 11th, 2005).jpg|thumb|right|200px|VTA low-floor light rail vehicle at Tasman Station on the Santa Teresa line]]\n\n===Bus routes===\n{{See also|List of Santa Clara VTA bus routes}}\n[[File:Santa Clara VTA bus.jpg|thumb|right|200px|VTA bus arriving at [[Foothill College]] in [[Los Altos Hills, California|Los Altos Hills]]]]\nVTA operates 50 regularly operating [[bus]] routes as of January 2020, including 37 regular bus routes, 3 rapid limited stop routes, and 10 express routes. Many of these routes connect to VTA light rail service and [[Caltrain]] stations. In addition, VTA operates a special service for Levi's Stadium events, 8 school trip services, and 8 free shuttle routes connecting to ACE commuter rail services. VTA also provides express bus service, including express bus service to [[Bay Area Rapid Transit|BART]] in [[Fremont, California|Fremont]].\n\nVTA's longest and most-used bus route is the 22, which connects VTA's [[Eastridge Transit Center]] in [[East San Jose]] with the [[Caltrain]] station in [[Palo Alto, California|Palo Alto]], which serves as a transfer point for [[SamTrans]] [[bus]]es from [[San Mateo County]]. Line 22 is the only line with 24-hour, 7 days-per-week service, including [[night bus service]] as part of the regional [[All-Nighter Network]]. One side effect of Line 22's 24-hour schedule is that it doubles as a moving homeless shelter.<ref>Jane Lii, \"Refuge On The Road: Homeless Find Nighttime Haven &mdash; The No. 22 Bus From Menlo Park To San Jose\", ''[[San Jose Mercury News]]'', 9 January 2000, 1A.</ref><ref>Cathy Newman, \"Silicon Valley: Inside the Dream Incubator\", ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'' 200, no. 6 (December 2001): 52-76.</ref> Line 22's fleet of coaches primarily consists of [[articulated bus|articulated]] [[low floor]]buses.\n\nOn January 14, 2008, VTA implemented major updates in its bus service. Some routes became part of a community bus network that utilizes shorter buses and charges a cheaper fee than standard bus service. Others became part of a core network with headways of 15 minutes or less. Additionally, some bus routes underwent changes in routing, while other, less-used routes were deleted completely. The agency completed another bus service redesign on December 28, 2019. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vta.org/newbusservice/index.html |title= New Bus Service |accessdate=2008-03-30 |publisher= Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080227065654/http://www.vta.org/newbusservice/index.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-02-27}}</ref>\n\n===BRT (Bus Rapid Transit)===\n\n====Current Service====\n[[File:BRT stop King Rd San Jose.jpg|thumb|right|King station along Rapid 522]]\n\nOn July 5, 2005, VTA implemented its first rapid bus line along the VTA's busiest corridor. Modeled after the [[Metro Rapid]] service in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], rapid bus Line 522 follows most of the Line 22 route, and features limited stops, headway based schedules, low floor fleet, and signal priority along El Camino Real. However, the current rapid bus service by VTA does not fully qualify as BRT, due to the lack of separate ticketing stations and platforms, distinctive vehicles, and special lanes (which make BRT mimic more of a light rail or tram route, instead of a bus route). Rather, it serves as a temporary rapid bus service until VTA officially opens a BRT transit corridor along the same route, which will upgrade the current 522 route.\n\n====Future====\n{{Santa Clara\u2013Alum Rock|collapse=yes}}\n{{update-section|date=March 2017}}\nVTA plans to add distinctive vehicles, separate bus-exclusive lanes on Alum Rock Avenue, El Camino Real, and Stevens Creek Road, ticketing platforms separate from other buses, and possible amentities such as wait time for successive BRT buses by 2016 (making BRT behave more like a light rail or tram system, instead of bus service). This would also upgrade the existing 522 bus service to official BRT, and rename the entire VTA-operated BRT service to VTA Rapid, differentiating it from VTA's buses division.\n\nVTA plans to split BRT into three separate lines. Construction is expected to commence in 2012, complete in 2013 on the line going east from SAP Center to [[Eastridge Center|Eastridge Mall]] via Santa Clara/Alum Rock, and in 2015 on the second line, which will go from SAP Center to Palo Alto along the El Camino Real. VTA will also construct a similar additional route along a third line, which will run from downtown San Jose to De Anza College on the Stevens Creek corridor (complementing regular route 23 service). This route is scheduled to open in 2017. Buses will operate with five-minute headways on the line east of SAP Center, and on ten-minute headways west of SAP Center.<ref>http://www.vta.org/valleyrapid/faqs/index.html</ref>\n\n===Paratransit===\n[[Paratransit]] service is door-to-door shuttle service available to disabled people that meet the requirements of the 1990 [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990]]. [http://www.mvtransit.com/ MV Transportation ], a for profit agency, is the contract paratransit broker for VTA.\n\n===Future SJC\u2013Diridon\u2013DAC connector===\nVTA released a request for information in July 2019 to solicit concepts for a grade-separated system that would connect [[Diridon Station]] with the [[San Jose International Airport]] (SJC), a distance of approximately {{convert|3|mi}}. Potential SJC airport connector alignments include either an underground route following existing streets, or an aerial route partially along [[California State Route 87|State Route 87]]. The RFI also asked potential bidders to design a continuation to [[De Anza College]] along [[Stevens Creek Boulevard]]. One major goal of the RFI was to determine if new technologies could be used to deliver a solution \"at significantly lower costs than traditional transit projects.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.vta.org/blog/connecting-san-jose-airport-transit |title=Connecting San Jose Airport With Transit |author=Ross, Stacey Hendler |date=July 2, 2019 |publisher=Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority |website=Headways [blog] |accessdate=19 August 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bidsync.com/bidsync-app-web/vendor/links/BidDetail.xhtml?bidid=2044862&roundId=null |title=Bid #RFI 2019-DOT-PPD-4 - New Transit Options: Airport-Diridon-Stevens Creek Transit Connection |publisher=City of San Jose |website=BidSync |accessdate=19 August 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Vintage trolley service===\nVTA operates a vintage trolley service seasonally.

The [[New Flyer Xcelsior]] XDE60 articulated buses were added to the fleet in early 2015, and are primarily used on BRT services. More [[Gillig Low Floor]] hybrid buses were added in January 2017. These buses are the first to feature VTA's new logo and paint scheme, and are planned for the complete replacement of the Gillig Phantoms, as well as the older non-hybrid low floor buses. Also, in late 2017 and early 2018, VTA added additional Gillig Low Floor hybrid buses (customized with BRT-styled headlamps), as well as [[Proterra, Inc.]] Catalyst battery electric buses. VTA received a newer batch of XDE60 buses, which will use VTA's current livery featured on 2017 Gilligs (as opposed with older articulated buses), primarily for replacing the older D60LF buses.\n\n==Highway improvement==\nBesides providing transit services to residents of Santa Clara County, VTA also manages countywide highway projects that use county sales tax revenues, in conjunction with [[California Department of Transportation|Caltrans]]. In this role, VTA was responsible for several highway projects such as widening portions of [[U.S. Route 101 in California|US 101]] between San Jose and [[Morgan Hill, California|Morgan Hill]], and [[Interstate 880 in California|Interstate 880]] within Santa Clara County. VTA will also be the leading agency in [[California State Route 152|SR 152]]/[[California State Route 156|SR 156]] interchange and future widening projects.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|San Francisco Bay Area}}\n* [[AC Transit]]\n* [[Altamont Corridor Express]]\n* [[Bay Area Rapid Transit]]\n* [[California Fuel Cell Partnership]]\n* [[Caltrain]]\n* [[Electric bus]]\n* [[Bus rapid transit]]\n* [[SamTrans]]\n* [[San Francisco Municipal Railway]]\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book |last=McCaleb |first=Charles S. |date=1994 |title=Rails, Roads & Runways: The 20-Year Saga of Santa Clara County's Transportation Agency |location=San Jose, CA |publisher=Santa Clara County Transportation Agency |isbn=978-0-9644-4660-1|ref=harv}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority}}\n*[http://www.vta.org/ VTA]\n*[http://outreach1.org/ Outreach]\n*[http://www.svtransitusers.org/ Silicon Valley Transit Users] - A public transit advocate and watchdog group not affiliated with VTA\n*[http://vtawatch.blogspot.com/ VTA Watch]\n*[http://www.transcoalition.org/ Transportation and Land Use Coalition]\n*[http://bayrailalliance.org/ BayRail Alliance]\n*[http://www.transitunlimited.org/VTA_bus_routes List of VTA bus routes and descriptions]\n\n{{Santa Clara VTA}}\n{{Caltrain}}\n{{San Francisco Bay Area Public Transit}}\n{{USLightRail}}\n\n[[Category:Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority| ]]\n[[Category:Public transportation in Santa Clara County, California]]\n[[Category:Bus transportation in California]]\n[[Category:Passenger rail transportation in California]]\n[[Category:Intermodal transportation authorities in California]]\n[[Category:1973 establishments in California]]\n[[Category:Government agencies established in 1973]]\n", "name_user": "The CA Navigator", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eFares", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Clara_Valley_Transportation_Authority"}
