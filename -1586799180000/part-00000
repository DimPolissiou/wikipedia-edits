Roosevelt announced his so-called [[Judiciary Reorganization Bill of 1937|court-packing plan]] in 1936. As Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Sumners discreetly worked in opposition. When the plan's bill was in trouble, Sumners reportedly said, \"Boys, here's where I cash in my chips,\" referring to his waning support for the President.<ref name=\"TexasHandbook\" />  Ultimately, Chairman Sumners came out formally against the Court-packing plan. He and two other Texans, Vice President [[John Nance Garner]] and Senator [[Tom Connally|Thomas T. Connally]], led the fight against the court plan because they saw the president\u2019s request as a symbolic desire for unlimited power. Sumners, as chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, decided that the reorganization bill would not come up in his committee, because he wanted to avoid it being sent to and passing in the full House. He traveled around the country making speeches about constitutional government. The bill never left his committee.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/jzc01|title=COURT-PACKING PLAN OF 1937|last=PATENAUDE|first=LIONEL V.|date=2010-06-12|website=tshaonline.org|language=en|access-date=2019-01-15}}</ref>\n\nHe faced two serious opponents in the 1938 election, but was re-elected and was not seriously challenged again.\n\nIn 1945, Sumners responded strongly to the lynching of Jesse James Payne, a prisoner in custody of Sheriff Lonnie T.

Less than a decade after he challenged the Dyer Anti-Lynching Bill, Sumners wrote in response to lynchings in Mississippi in 1931, \u201cWhat we want to do is to have a meeting to oppose lynchings in Mississippi and to see if we can get Mississippi to do something about it, and if we can get other states to become more effective in suppressing lynchings.\u201d<ref>Personal letter to Mrs. Jessie Danie Ames, May 12, 1931, Dallas Historical Society, HWS Collection, D-75.8    </ref>\n\nIn the wake of the lynchings of Roosevelt Townes and Robert McDaniels in 1937, Sumners was asked to speak about anti-lynching legislation to the Mississippi Council of Southern Women for the Prevention of Lynching, but declined, writing, \u201cIt has occurred to me that it would not be good strategy for me to make an address on the subject suggested at the Public Meeting to be held by your Council at [[Jackson, Mississippi|Jackson]] on May 27<sup>th</sup>.  The meeting would be construed as being opposed to anti-lynching legislation; whereas, to be effective it should be a meeting opposed to lynching. This suggestion is very important\u2026everything should indicate that you are trying to stop mob violence and that this is the whole purpose of the meeting.\u201d<ref>Personal letter to Mrs. L. W. Alford, Chairman of the Mississippi Council of Southern Women for the Prevention of Lynching, May 4, 1937, Dallas Historical Society, HWS Collection, D-75.8.</ref>\n\nIn reference to the 1937 lynchings, an outraged Sumners sent the Governor of Mississippi a telegram that stated \u201cIf the press reports are even approximately correct, and they seem to be, these lynchings, both with regard to lynchers and the officers involved, were as dastardly a crime as cowardice could devise and brutality execute. It is the sort of thing which makes it hard for us who are trying to protect the governmental sovereignty of the states.  It will be effectively seized upon as a demonstration of the ability of states to govern. As one Southern man to another, I hope I will not be considered impertinent by stating candidly my own reaction and that is that the State of Mississippi cannot escape this reflection upon its governmental capacity, in fact cannot escape in effect becoming an accessory after the fact unless it is able to and does bring these lynchers and officers to speedy and adequate punishment.\u201d<ref>Western Union Telegram to Honorable Hugh White, Governor of Mississippi, April 14, 1937, Dallas Historical Society, HWS Collection, D-97.6.</ref> Sumners called for justice against anyone involved in the now-infamous lynchings including the sheriffs, writing, \u201cThe turning over of a prisoner, regardless of the crime charged against him, for execution by some agency other than that provided by the laws of the country is a confession of unfitness to govern.\u201d<ref>Personal letter to Attorney General of Alabama, A. A. Carmichael, May 25, 1937, DHS, HWS Collection, D-75.8.</ref>\n\n==Final years==\nAfter leaving Congress, Sumners was the Director of Research for the [[Southwestern Legal Foundation]]. Sumners formed the Hatton W. Sumners Foundation in 1949, which still awards loans and scholarships to worthy students.

Roosevelt announced his so-called [[Judiciary Reorganization Bill of 1937|court-packing plan]] in 1936. As Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Sumners discreetly worked in opposition. When the plan's bill was in trouble, Sumners reportedly said, \"Boys, here's where I cash in my chips,\" referring to his waning support for the President.<ref name=\"TexasHandbook\" />  Ultimately, Chairman Sumners came out formally against the Court-packing plan. He and two other Texans, Vice President [[John Nance Garner]] and Senator [[Tom Connally|Thomas T. Connally]], led the fight against the court plan because they saw the president\u2019s request as a symbolic desire for unlimited power. Sumners, as chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, decided that the reorganization bill would not come up in his committee, because he wanted to avoid it being sent to and passing in the full House. He traveled around the country making speeches about constitutional government. The bill never left his committee.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/jzc01|title=COURT-PACKING PLAN OF 1937|last=PATENAUDE|first=LIONEL V.|date=2010-06-12|website=tshaonline.org|language=en|access-date=2019-01-15}}</ref>\n\nHe faced two serious opponents in the 1938 election, but was re-elected and was not seriously challenged again.\n\nIn 1945, Sumners responded strongly to the lynching of Jesse James Payne, a prisoner in custody of Sheriff Lonnie T.

Less than a decade after he challenged the Dyer Anti-Lynching Bill, Sumners wrote in response to lynchings in Mississippi in 1931, \u201cWhat we want to do is to have a meeting to oppose lynchings in Mississippi and to see if we can get Mississippi to do something about it, and if we can get other states to become more effective in suppressing lynchings.\u201d<ref>Personal letter to Mrs. Jessie Danie Ames, May 12, 1931, Dallas Historical Society, HWS Collection, D-75.8    </ref>\n\nIn the wake of the lynchings of Roosevelt Townes and Robert McDaniels in 1937, Sumners was asked to speak about anti-lynching legislation to the Mississippi Council of Southern Women for the Prevention of Lynching, but declined, writing, \u201cIt has occurred to me that it would not be good strategy for me to make an address on the subject suggested at the Public Meeting to be held by your Council at [[Jackson, Mississippi|Jackson]] on May 27<sup>th</sup>.  The meeting would be construed as being opposed to anti-lynching legislation; whereas, to be effective it should be a meeting opposed to lynching. This suggestion is very important\u2026everything should indicate that you are trying to stop mob violence and that this is the whole purpose of the meeting.\u201d<ref>Personal letter to Mrs. L. W. Alford, Chairman of the Mississippi Council of Southern Women for the Prevention of Lynching, May 4, 1937, Dallas Historical Society, HWS Collection, D-75.8.</ref>\n\nIn reference to the 1937 lynchings, an outraged Sumners sent the Governor of Mississippi a telegram that stated \u201cIf the press reports are even approximately correct, and they seem to be, these lynchings, both with regard to lynchers and the officers involved, were as dastardly a crime as cowardice could devise and brutality execute. It is the sort of thing which makes it hard for us who are trying to protect the governmental sovereignty of the states.  It will be effectively seized upon as a demonstration of the ability of states to govern. As one Southern man to another, I hope I will not be considered impertinent by stating candidly my own reaction and that is that the State of Mississippi cannot escape this reflection upon its governmental capacity, in fact cannot escape in effect becoming an accessory after the fact unless it is able to and does bring these lynchers and officers to speedy and adequate punishment.\u201d<ref>Western Union Telegram to Honorable Hugh White, Governor of Mississippi, April 14, 1937, Dallas Historical Society, HWS Collection, D-97.6.</ref> Sumners called for justice against anyone involved in the now-infamous lynchings including the sheriffs, writing, \u201cThe turning over of a prisoner, regardless of the crime charged against him, for execution by some agency other than that provided by the laws of the country is a confession of unfitness to govern.\u201d<ref>Personal letter to Attorney General of Alabama, A. A. Carmichael, May 25, 1937, DHS, HWS Collection, D-75.8.</ref>\n\n==Final years==\nAfter leaving Congress, Sumners was the Director of Research for the [[Southwestern Legal Foundation]].

In the early 19th century, the   Potawatomi had a village in present-day [[Thiensville, Wisconsin|Thiensville]] located on Pigeon Creek, north of Freistadt Road.

Eventually the Potawatomi who evaded forced removal gathered in northern Wisconsin, where they formed the [[Forest County Potawatomi Community]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Potawatomi History|url=https://www.mpm.edu/content/wirp/ICW-152|publisher=Milwaukee Public Museum|accessdate=February 20, 2020}}</ref>\n\nWhite trappers, explorers, and traders used the Milwaukee River through the middle of what is now Mequon as a means of transportation. The first permanent white settlers arrived in the mid-1830s from New York, England, and Ireland. One of the first settlers was John Weston, who settled near present-day Thiensville in 1837 and served as the first postmaster of the Town of Mequon. One of the oldest surviving buildings from this period is the [[Isham Day House]], constructed in 1839 on the west bank of the river. The first [[Germans]] arrived in 1839, and in the 1840s Germans became the largest ethnic group in Mequon and Ozaukee County.<ref>{{cite web|title=Early history of Ozaukee County, Wisconsin|url=http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/WI/WI-idx?type=div&did=WI.OzEarlyHist.i0034&isize=M|publisher=University of Wisconsin-Madison Libraries|accessdate=2020-01-03}}</ref>\n\n===Freistadt===\nIn October 1839, a party of twenty German families from [[Province of Pomerania (1815\u20131945)|Pomerania]], [[Prussia]], settled the Freistadt community in the western part of the Town of Mequon. They were [[Old Lutherans]] who had resisted the Prussian government's attempts to take control over the Protestant churches through the [[Prussian Union of Churches]].<ref>Ozaukee County.

It was the first Lutheran church in Wisconsin. In 1845, what would become the [[Lutheran Synod of Buffalo]] was organized in Freistadt. However, the Freistadt church became a part of the [[Lutheran Church\u2013Missouri Synod]] in 1848.<ref>{{cite web|title=Early history of Ozaukee County, Wisconsin|url=http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/WI/WI-idx?type=turn&entity=WI.OzEarlyHist.p0103&id=WI.OzEarlyHist&isize=M|publisher=University of Wisconsin-Madison Libraries|accessdate=2020-01-03}}</ref> The wooden church was replaced with a limestone building in 1884.<ref>{{cite web|title=Property Record: 10729 W Freistadt Rd.|url=https://www.wisconsinhistory.org/Records/Property/HI13485|publisher=Wisconsin Historical Society|accessdate=2020-01-03}}</ref>\n\n===Thiensville===\nJoachim Heinrich Thien moved to the area in 1842 from [[Oldenburg]], [[Prussia]], and helped design a plan for the settlement that would become [[Thiensville, Wisconsin|Thiensville]]. A year later he employed a group of Native American laborers to construct a dam and a canal. He then built a sawmill and a store. Thien hosted the first town meeting for the Town of Mequon in 1846,<ref name= \"corrigan\"/> and in 1857 he established the volunteer fire department and served as its first captain.\n\nThien was a [[Freethought|freethinker]], as were many of the early German settlers. The influence of the freethinker societies kept formal churches out of the village until 1919, when St. Cecilia Catholic Church was built.<ref>{{cite web|title=Encyclopedia of Milwaukee: Village of Thiensville|url=https://emke.uwm.edu/entry/village-of-thiensville/|publisher=University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee|accessdate=2020-01-03}}</ref>\n\nThiensville grew in part because of its location on the [[Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad|Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul Railway]], which was constructed in the early 1870s. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Thiensville was one of the most concentrated communities in the Town of Mequon. While most of Mequon was quite rural, Theinsville functioned as a downtown area with stores, mills, and professional services. The village of Theinsville incorporated in 1910.\n\nIn 1945, eighty German [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] from Camp Fredonia in [[Little Kohler, Wisconsin]] were contracted to work at the Herbert A.

Between 1950 and 1960, the population increased by roughly 110%, from 4,065 to 8,543. With growth came the risk that municipalities such as Thiensville or [[Milwaukee]] would try to annex land from the Town of Mequon, as happened to the Milwaukee County's [[Lake, Milwaukee County, Wisconsin|Town of Lake]] in 1954 and [[Granville, Milwaukee|Town of Granville]] in 1956. With a 1957 population of about 7,500, Mequon incorporated as a city under the terms of Wisconsin statute 66.0215, also known as \"The Oak Creek Law,\" which had been crafted to prevent suburban towns from being annexed by other municipalities.<ref>[http://nxt.legis.state.wi.us/nxt/gateway.dll?f=templates&fn=default.htm&vid=WI:Default&d=stats&jd=66.0215 Wisconsin Legislature Data<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref name=\"Encyclopedia\">{{cite web|title=Encyclopedia of Milwaukee: City of Mequon|url=https://emke.uwm.edu/entry/city-of-mequon/|publisher=University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee|accessdate=2020-01-03}}</ref>\n\nThe city continued to grow with the construction of [[Interstate 43]] in the mid-1960s, making travel to Milwaukee easier.

There is also a large [[Larix laricina|tamarack]] swamp along the Little Menomonee River.

The first permanent white settlers arrived in the mid-1830s from New York, England, and Ireland. One of the first settlers was John Weston, who settled near present-day Thiensville in 1837 and served as the first postmaster of the Town of Mequon. One of the oldest surviving buildings from this period is the [[Isham Day House]], constructed in 1839 on the west bank of the river. The first [[Germans]] arrived in 1839, and in the 1840s Germans became the largest ethnic group in Mequon and Ozaukee County.<ref>{{cite web|title=Early history of Ozaukee County, Wisconsin|url=http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/WI/WI-idx?type=div&did=WI.OzEarlyHist.i0034&isize=M|publisher=University of Wisconsin-Madison Libraries|accessdate=2020-01-03}}</ref>\n\n===Freistadt===\nIn October 1839, a party of twenty German families from [[Province of Pomerania (1815\u20131945)|Pomerania]], [[Prussia]], settled the Freistadt community in the western part of the Town of Mequon.

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Thiensville was one of the most concentrated communities in the Town of Mequon.

Between 1950 and 1960, the population increased by roughly 110%, from 4,065 to 8,543. With growth came the risk that municipalities such as Thiensville or [[Milwaukee]] would try to annex land from the Town of Mequon, as happened to the Milwaukee County's [[Lake, Milwaukee County, Wisconsin|Town of Lake]] in 1954 and [[Granville, Milwaukee|Town of Granville]] in 1956. With a 1957 population of about 7,500, Mequon incorporated as a city under the terms of Wisconsin statute 66.0215, also known as \"The Oak Creek Law,\" which had been crafted to prevent suburban towns from being annexed by other municipalities.<ref>[http://nxt.legis.state.wi.us/nxt/gateway.dll?f=templates&fn=default.htm&vid=WI:Default&d=stats&jd=66.0215 Wisconsin Legislature Data<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref name=\"Encyclopedia\">{{cite web|title=Encyclopedia of Milwaukee: City of Mequon|url=https://emke.uwm.edu/entry/city-of-mequon/|publisher=University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee|accessdate=2020-01-03}}</ref>\n\nThe city continued to grow with the construction of [[Interstate 43]] in the mid-1960s, making travel to Milwaukee easier.

[[Pakistan]] geologically overlaps both with the [[Indian Plate|Indian]] and the [[Eurasian Plate|Eurasian]] [[plate tectonics|tectonic plates]] where its [[Sindh]] and [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]] provinces lie on the north-western corner of the Indian plate while [[Balochistan, Pakistan|Balochistan]] and most of the [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] lie within the Eurasian plate which mainly comprises the [[Iranian Plateau]]. [[Gilgit-Baltistan]] and [[Azad Kashmir]] lie along the edge of the Indian plate and hence are prone to violent [[earthquake]]s where the two tectonic plates collide.\n\nPakistan is bordered by [[India]] to the east, [[Afghanistan]] to the northwest and [[Iran]] to the west while [[China]] borders the country in the northeast. The nation is geopolitically placed within some of the most controversial regional boundaries which share disputes and have many-a-times escalated military tensions between the nations, e.g., that of [[Kashmir]] with India and the [[Durand Line]] with Afghanistan. Its western borders include the [[Khyber Pass]] and [[Bolan Pass]] that have served as traditional migration routes between Central [[Eurasia]] and [[South Asia]].\n\nAt {{convert|881,913|km2}}, Pakistan is the 33rd largest country by area, little more than twice the size of the US state of [[California]], and slightly larger than the Canadian province of [[Alberta]]. {{cn|date=November 2019}}\n\n==International boundaries==\n[[Image:Pakistan 2002 CIA map.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|International and provincial boundaries of Pakistan]]\n[[Image:Pakistan relief location map.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|International boundaries of Pakistani terrain]]\nPakistan shares its borders with four neighboring countries \u2013 [[People's Republic of China]], [[Afghanistan]], [[India]], and [[Iran]] while [[Tajikistan]] is separated by thin [[Wakhan Corridor]]\u2013 adding up to about {{convert|6975|km|mi|1|abbr=on}} in length (excluding the coastal areas).\n\nPakistan borders Afghanistan at the [[Durand Line]], {{convert|2430|km|mi|1|abbr=on}}, which runs from the [[Hindu Kush]] and the [[Pamir Mountains]]. A narrow strip of Afghanistan territory called the [[Wakhan Corridor]] extends between Pakistan and [[Tajikistan]]. From the eastern tip of the Wakhan Corridor starts the Sino-Pak border between the [[People's Republic of China]] and Pakistan spanning about {{convert|510|km|mi|1|abbr=on}}. It carries on south-eastward and ends near the [[Karakoram Pass]]. This line was determined from 1961 to 1965 in a series of agreements between China and Pakistan and finally on 03-03-1963 both the governments, of [[Islamabad]] and [[Beijing]], formally agreed. It is understood that if the dispute over Kashmir is resolved, the border would need to be discussed again.<ref name=\"CITEREFPakistanGeography\">{{cite web\n|url=http://countrystudies.us/pakistan/23.htm\n|title=Pakistan: Geography\n|publisher=US Country Studies\n|accessdate=2008-05-05}}</ref>\n\nThe boundary with [[Iran]], {{convert|909|km|mi|1|abbr=on}}, was first delimited by a British commission in the same year as the Durand Line was demarcated, separating Iran from what was then British India's [[Baluchistan (Chief Commissioners Province)|Baluchistan]] province.<ref name=\"CITEREFPakistanGeography\"/> Modern Iran has a province named [[Sistan va Baluchistan]] that borders Pakistan and has [[Baloch people|Baluchis]] in an ethnic majority. In 1957 Pakistan signed a frontier agreement with Iran in [[Rawalpindi]] according to which the border was officially declared and the two countries haven't had this border as a subject of serious dispute at all.\n<!--[[Image:Earthquake Information for Pakistan.gif|thumb|Map depicting tectonic plates shows Indian and Eurasian tectonic plate divide throughout Pakistan and Kashmir where earthquake activity is common.]]-->\nThe [[Northern Areas]] has five of the world's seventeen highest [[mountain|peaks]] along with highest range of mountains the [[Karakoram]] and [[Himalayas]]. It also has such extensive [[glacier]]s that it has sometimes been called the \"[[Siachen Glacier|Third Pole]]\". The international border-line has been a matter of pivotal dispute between Pakistan and India ever since 1947, and the [[Siachen Glacier]] in northern Kashmir has been an important arena for fighting between the two sides since 1984, although far more soldiers have died of exposure to the cold than from any skirmishes in the conflict between their National Armies facing each other.\n\nThe Pakistan-India [[ceasefire]] [[border|line]] runs from the Karakoram Pass west-southwest to a point about 130 kilometers northwest of Lahore. This line, about 770 kilometers long, was arranged with [[United Nations]] (UNO) assistance at the end of the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947\u201348. The ceasefire line came into effect on January 1, 1949, after eighteen months of fighting between Indian forces and Pakistani forces and was last adjusted and agreed upon by the two countries according to the [[Shimla Agreement]] of July 2, 1972 between [[Indira Gandhi]] and [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]]. Since then, it has been generally known as the Line of Control or the (LoC).\n\nThe [[India\u2013Pakistan border]] continues irregularly southward for about 1,280 kilometers, following the [[Radcliffe line]], named for Sir [[Cyril Radcliffe, 1st Viscount Radcliffe|Cyril Radcliffe]], the head of the British Boundary Commission on the division of the [[Punjab Province (British India)|Punjab]] and [[Bengal]] provinces of [[British India]] on 13 August 1947.\n\nThe southern borders are far less contentious than those in northern Pakistan (Kashmir). The Thar Desert in the province of [[Sindh]] is separated in the south from the salt flats of the Rann of Kachchh (Kutch) by a boundary that was first delineated in 1923\u201324. After independence and dissolution of Empire, Independent and free Pakistan contested the southern boundary of Sindh, and a succession of border incidents resulted. They were less dangerous and less widespread, however, than the conflict that erupted in Kashmir in the Indo-Pakistani War of August 1965 started with this decisive core of issues. These southern hostilities were ended by British mediation during Harold Wilson's era, and both sides accepted the award of the Indo-Pakistan Western Boundary Case Tribunal designated by the UN secretary general himself. The tribunal made its award on February 19, 1968; delimiting a line of 403 kilometers that was later demarcated by joint survey teams, Of its original claim of some 9,100 square kilometers, Pakistan was awarded only about 780 square kilometers. Beyond the western terminus of the tribunal's award, the final stretch of Pakistan's border with India is about 80 kilometers long, running east and southeast of Sindh to an inlet of the [[Arabian Sea]].\n\n===Maritime claims===\n;Contiguous zone\n:{{convert|12|nmi}}\n;Continental shelf\n:{{convert|200|nmi}}, or to the edge of the [[continental margin]]\n;[[Exclusive economic zone]]\n:{{convert|290,000|km2|mi2|abbr=on}}\n;Territorial sea\n:{{convert|12|nmi}}\n\n{{Borders of Pakistan}}\n\n==Geographical regions==\n[[Image:Pakistan Topography.png|thumb|Topography of Pakistan]]\nPakistan is divided into three major geographic areas: the northern highlands; the [[Indus River]] plain, with two major subdivisions corresponding roughly to the provinces of [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]] and [[Sindh]]; and the Balochistan [[Plateau]]. Some geographers designate additional major regions. For example, the mountain ranges along the western border with [[Afghanistan]] are sometimes described separately from the Balochistan Plateau, and on the eastern border with India, south of the [[Sutlej River]], the [[Thar Desert]] may be considered separately from the Indus Plain. Nevertheless, the country may conveniently be visualized in general terms as divided in three by an imaginary line drawn eastward from the [[Khyber Pass]] and another drawn southwest from [[Islamabad]] down the middle of the country. Roughly, then, the northern highlands are north of the imaginary east-west line; the Balochistan Plateau is to the west of the imaginary southwest line; and the Indus Plain lies to the east of that line.\n\n===The northern highlands===\nThe northern highlands include parts of the Hindu Kush, the [[Karakoram]] Range, and the [[Himalayas]]. This area includes such famous peaks as [[K2]]<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic-art/312055/69374/K2-in-the-Karakoram-Range-northern-Baltistan-Northern-Areas-Pak K2] \u2013 Britannica.com</ref> (Mount Godwin Austen, at 8,611 meters the second highest peak in the world). More than one-half of the summits are over 4,500 meters, and more than fifty peaks reach above 6,500 meters. Travel through the area is difficult and dangerous, although the government is attempting to develop certain areas into tourist and trekking sites. Because of their rugged topography and the rigors of the climate, the northern highlands and the [[Himalayas]] to the east have been formidable barriers to movement into Pakistan throughout history.\n[[Image:K2 8611.jpg|thumb|[[K2]], at 8,619 metres (28,251 ft), is the world's second highest peak]]\n\nSouth of the northern highlands and west of the [[Indus River]] plain are the Safed Koh Range along the Afghanistan border and the Sulaiman Range and Kirthar Range, which define the western extent of the province of Sindh and reach almost to the southern coast. The lower reaches are far more arid than those in the north, and they branch into ranges that run generally to the southwest across the province Balochistan. North-south valleys in Balochistan and Sindh have restricted the migration of peoples along the Makran Coast on the Arabian Sea east toward the plains.\n\nSeveral large passes cut the ranges along the border with [[Afghanistan]]. Among them are the [[Khojak Pass]], about eighty kilometres northwest of Quetta in Balochistan; the Khyber Pass, forty kilometres west of [[Peshawar]] and leading to [[Kabul]]; and the [[Broghol]] Pass in the far north, providing access to the [[Wakhan Corridor]].\n\nLess than one-fifth of Pakistan's land area has the potential for intensive [[agriculture|agricultural]] use. Nearly all of the arable land is actively cultivated, but outputs are low by world standards. Cultivation is sparse in the northern mountains, the southern deserts, and the western [[plateau]]s, but the [[Indus River]] basin in Punjab and northern Sindh has [[fertility|fertile]] soil that enables Pakistan to feed its population under usual climatic conditions.\n\n===The Indus plain===\n{{Main|Indo-Gangetic plain}}\nThe name Indus comes from the Sanskrit word hindu, meaning ocean, from which also come the words Sindh, Hindu, and India. The Indus, one of the great rivers of the world, rises in southwestern [[Tibet]] only about 160 kilometres west of the source of the [[Sutlej River]], which first flows through [[Punjab, India]] and joins the [[Indus]] in [[Pakistani Punjab]], and the [[Brahmaputra]], which runs eastward before turning southwest and flowing through [[India]] and, [[Bangladesh]]. The catchment area of the Indus is estimated at almost 1 million square kilometres, and all of Pakistan's major rivers\u2014the Kabul, Jhelum, and Chenab\u2014flow into it. The Indus River basin is a large, fertile alluvial plain formed by silt from the Indus. This area has been inhabited by agricultural civilizations for at least 5,000 years.\n\n===Baluchistan===\n[[Image:NEO sulaiman big.jpg|thumb|Satellite image of the Sulaiman Range]]\n{{Main|Balochistan, Pakistan}}\nBalochistan is located at the eastern edge of the Iranian plateau and in the border region between Southwest, Central, and South Asia. It is geographically the largest of the four provinces at 347,190&nbsp;km\u00b2 or (134,051 square miles) of Pakistani territory; and composes 48% of the total land area of Pakistan. The population density is very low due to the mountainous terrain and scarcity of water. The southern region is known as [[Makran]]. The central region is known as [[Kalat (princely state)|Kalat]].\n\nThe [[Sulaiman Mountains]] dominate the northeast corner and the Bolan Pass is a natural route into Afghanistan towards Kandahar. Much of the province south of the [[Quetta]] region is sparse desert terrain with pockets of inhabitable towns mostly near rivers and streams. The largest desert is the [[Kharan Desert]] which occupies the most of [[Kharan District]].\n\nThis area is subject to frequent [[seismology|seismic]] disturbances because the [[plate tectonics|tectonic plate]] under the Indian plate hits the plate under Eurasia as it continues to move northward and to push the Himalayas ever higher. The region surrounding Quetta is highly prone to [[earthquake]]s. A severe quake in 1931 was followed by one of more destructive force in 1935. The small city of [[Quetta]] was almost completely destroyed, and the adjacent military cantonment was heavily damaged. At least 20,000 people were killed. Tremors continue in the vicinity of [[Quetta]]; the most recent major [[october 2005 kashmir earthquake|earthquake]] in which nearly 10,0000 people died and [[2008 Balochistan earthquake|earthquake]]<ref>Center for the Observation and Modeling of Earthquakes and Tectonics (COMET), 2005. Locating the Kashmir Fault, http://comet.nerc.ac. uk/news_kashmir.html</ref> occurred in October 2008 in which 30,000 people were killed. In January 1991 a severe earthquake destroyed entire villages in the [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa]], but far fewer people were killed in the quake than died in 1935. A major earthquake centred in the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa's Kohistan District in 1965 also caused heavy damage.\n\n==Climate==\n{{Main|Climate of Pakistan}}\n[[File:Pakistan map of K\u00f6ppen climate classification.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|Pakistan map of K\u00f6ppen climate classification zones]]\n[[Image:Pakistan.A2005097.0615.1km.jpg|thumb|Dust storm over Pakistan and surrounding countries, April 7, 2005]]\nPakistan lies in the [[temperate]] zone, immediately above the [[tropic of cancer]]. The climate varies from [[tropical]] to temperate. [[Arid]] conditions exist in the coastal south, characterized by a [[monsoon]] season with adequate rainfall and a dry season with lesser rainfall, while abundant rainfall is experienced by the province of [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]], and wide variations between extremes of temperature at given locations. Rainfall varies from as little as less than 10&nbsp;inches a year to over 150&nbsp;inches a year, in various parts of the nation. These generalizations should not, however, obscure the distinct differences existing among particular locations. For example, the coastal area along the Arabian Sea is usually warm, whereas the frozen snow-covered ridges of the [[Karakoram]] Range and of other mountains of the far north are so cold year round that they are only accessible by world-class climbers for a few weeks in May and June of each year.\n\nPakistan has four seasons: a cool, dry winter marked by mild temperatures from December through February; a hot, dry spring from March through May; the summer rainy season, or southwest monsoon period, from June through September; and the retreating monsoon period of October and November. The onset and duration of these seasons vary somewhat according to location.\n\nThe climate in the capital city of [[Islamabad]] varies from an average daily low of {{convert|5|\u00b0C|1}} in January to an average daily high of {{convert|40|\u00b0C}} in June. Half of the annual rainfall occurs in July and August, averaging about {{convert|300|mm|in|2}} in each of those two months. The remainder of the year has significantly less rain, amounting to about {{convert|100|mm|in|2}} per month. [[Hail]]storms are common in early spring.\n\nPakistan's largest city, [[Karachi]], which is also the country's [[Industry|industrial]] center, is more humid than Islamabad but gets significantly lesser rainfall. Only July and August average more than {{convert|50|mm|in|2}} of rainfall in the Karachi area; the remaining months are exceedingly dry with little rainfall. The temperature is also more uniform in Karachi than in Islamabad, ranging from an average daily low of {{convert|13|\u00b0C|1}} during winter evenings to an average daily high of {{convert|34|\u00b0C|1}} on summer days. Although the summer temperatures do not get as high as those in Punjab, the high humidity causes the residents a great deal of discomfort.\n\n===Water resources===\n{{Main|Water resources management in Pakistan}}\n{{Main|Water supply and sanitation in Pakistan}}\nHydrological power is a renewable resource which benefits Pakistan a lot. After the Indus Water Treaty on 1960 World Bank decided that River Sutlej, Ravi and Beas water will be used by India and River Indus, Jhelum and Chenab water will be used by Pakistan. Pakistan was told to build two dams, one tarbela and second Mangla, five barrages, eight link canals, and one gated siphon. For this, India was told to participate 60%, whereas Pakistan, 40%. Pakistan is considering to develop wind turbines to fulfill the demand for electricity. Solar power is now slowly flourishing but it is still installed on a small scale.\n \nPakistan largest river is known as the Indus River which flows from Tibet/China and enters Pakistan through Gilgit Baltistan. The Indus River system is divided into two plains. The Upper Indus Plain starts from northern Pakistan and ends up at Mithankot. The Indus has tributaries on both western and eastern side. The Indus' eastern tributaries are the Jhelum, Chenab, Sutlej, Ravi and Beas. These four rivers flow in Punjab and meet at Panjnad where they are known as Panjnad river. The Indus' western tributaries are the Swat, Kabul, Kurrram, Tochi, Gomal, Zhob rivers. These rivers join the Indus at KPK. At Mithankot these rivers finally meet with the River Indus. After this the Indus flows alone through the Lower Indus Plain. Lower Indus Plain starts from Mithankot up to Thatta where the Indus meets with the Arabian Sea. This place is also known as Indus Delta.\n\n===Fuel resources===\n{{Main|Fuel extraction in Pakistan}}\nPakistan has extensive energy resources, including fairly sizable [[natural gas]] reserves, [[petroleum]] oil reserves, [[coal]] fields and large [[hydropower]] potential.\n\n===Agriculture===\n{{Main|Agriculture in Pakistan}}\nAbout 26% of Pakistan's total land area is under cultivation and is watered by one of the largest irrigation systems in the world. The most important crops are [[tobacco]], [[cotton]], [[wheat]], [[rice]], [[sugarcane]], [[maize]], [[sorghum]], [[millets]], [[pulse]]s, [[vegetable oil|oil seeds]], [[barley]], [[fruit]]s and [[vegetable]]s, which together account for more than 75% of the value of total crop output.<ref>Environment of Pakistan pg213.\"Major crop output\" line 13</ref>\n\n===Fishery===\n{{Main|Fishing in Pakistan}}\n[[Fishery]] and [[fishing industry]] plays an important role in the national economy of [[Pakistan]]. With a coastline of about 1046&nbsp;km, Pakistan has enough fishery resources that remain to be fully developed. It is also a major source of export earning.\n\n===Forestry===\n{{Main|Forestry in Pakistan}}\nAbout only 4.1% of land in Pakistan is covered with forests. The forests of Pakistan are a main source of food, [[lumber]], [[paper]], [[fuel wood]], [[latex]], [[medicinal plant|medicine]] as well as used for purposes of [[wildlife]] conservation and [[Eco tourism]].\n\n===Mining===\n{{Main|Mining in Pakistan}}\nThe Salt Range in the [[Potwar Plateau]] has large deposits of [[rock salt]]. Pakistan has extensive mineral resources, including fairly sizable reserves of [[gypsum]], [[limestone]], [[chromite]]s, [[iron ore]], [[halite|rock salt]], [[silver]], [[gold]], precious stones, [[gemstone|gem]]s, [[marble]]s, [[tile]]s, [[copper]], [[sulfur]], [[fire clay]] and silica sand.\n\n==Environment and conservation==\n{{Main|Environmental issues in Pakistan}}\nThe environmental issues is a great problem for the nature and nation of Pakistan and has been disturbing the balance between economic development and environmental protection. As Pakistan is a large importer of both exhaustible and renewable natural resources and a large consumer of [[fossil fuel]]s, the Ministry of Environment of [[Government of Pakistan]] takes responsibility to conserve and [[Environmentalism|protect the environment]].\n\n'''Current issues''': water pollution from raw sewage, industrial wastes, and agricultural runoff; limited natural fresh water resources; a majority of the population does not have access to potable water; [[deforestation]]; [[soil erosion]]; [[desertification]].\n\n===Natural disasters===\n{{Main|List of natural disasters in Pakistan}}\nPakistan is subject to frequent [[earthquake]]s which are often severe (especially in north and west) and severe [[flood]]ing along the Indus after heavy rains (July and August). [[Landslide]]s are common in the northern mountains.\n\n===Protected areas===\n{{Main|Protected areas of Pakistan}}\nThere are 15 [[National Parks|national parks]], 72 [[Wildlife Sanctuary|wildlife sanctuaries]], 66 [[game reserve]]s, 9 marine and littoral protected areas, 19 protected [[Ramsar convention|wetlands]] and a number of other protected [[grassland]]s, [[shrubland]]s, [[woodland]]s and [[natural monument]]s.\n\n===International agreements===\nPakistan is a party to several international agreements related to environment and climate, the most prominent among them are:\n\n{| width=\"100%\" bgcolor=\"#fff4f4\"\n!align=\"center\" colspan=\"2\"|Treaties and Agreements\n|-align=\"center\"\n!align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"| Specific Regions and [[Sea]]s\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|<small> [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea|Law of the Sea]], Ship Pollution ([[MARPOL 73/78]])</small>\n|-align=\"center\"\n!align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"| [[Earth's atmosphere|Atmosphere]] and [[Climate]]\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|<small>[[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change|Climate Change]], [[Montreal Protocol|Ozone Layer Protection]], [[Partial Test Ban Treaty|Nuclear Test Ban]]</small>\n|-align=\"center\"\n!align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"| [[Biodiversity]], [[environment (biophysical)|Environment]], and [[Forest]]s\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|<small>[[United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification|Desertification]], [[CITES|Endangered Species]], [[Environmental Modification Convention|Environmental Modification]], [[Ramsar Convention|Wetland]]s, [[Convention on Fishing and Conservation of Living Resources of the High Seas|Marine Life Conservation]]</small>\n|-align=\"center\"\n!align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"| [[Waste]]s\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|<small>[[Basel Convention|Hazardous Wastes]]</small>\n|-align=\"center\"\n!align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"| [[River]]s\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|<small>[[Indus Waters Treaty]]</small>\n|}\n\n== Suffix of regions and towns ==\nParts of region and settlement names:\n\n* [[-abad]] ({{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|  \u0640 \u0622\u0628\u0627\u062f }}}}) means settled place.

[[Pakistan]] geologically overlaps both with the [[Indian Plate|Indian]] and the [[Eurasian Plate|Eurasian]] [[plate tectonics|tectonic plates]] where its [[Sindh]] and [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]] provinces lie on the north-western corner of the Indian plate while [[Balochistan, Pakistan|Balochistan]] and most of the [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] lie within the Eurasian plate which mainly comprises the [[Iranian Plateau]]. [[Gilgit-Baltistan]] and [[Azad Kashmir]] lie along the edge of the Indian plate and hence are prone to violent [[earthquake]]s where the two tectonic plates collide.\n\nPakistan is bordered by [[India]] to the east, [[Afghanistan]] to the northwest and [[Iran]] to the west while [[China]] borders the country in the northeast. The nation is geopolitically placed within some of the most controversial regional boundaries which share disputes and have many-a-times escalated military tensions between the nations, e.g., that of [[Kashmir]] with India and the [[Durand Line]] with Afghanistan. Its western borders include the [[Khyber Pass]] and [[Bolan Pass]] that have served as traditional migration routes between Central [[Eurasia]] and [[South Asia]].\n\nAt {{convert|881,913|km2}}, Pakistan is the 33rd largest country by area, little more than twice the size of the US state of [[California]], and slightly larger than the Canadian province of [[Alberta]]. {{cn|date=November 2019}}\n\n==International boundaries==\n[[Image:Pakistan 2002 CIA map.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|International and provincial boundaries of Pakistan]]\n[[Image:Pakistan relief location map.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|International boundaries of Pakistani terrain]]\nPakistan shares its borders with four neighboring countries \u2013 [[People's Republic of China]], [[Afghanistan]], [[India]], and [[Iran]] while [[Tajikistan]] is separated by thin [[Wakhan Corridor]]\u2013 adding up to about {{convert|6975|km|mi|1|abbr=on}} in length (excluding the coastal areas).\n\nPakistan borders Afghanistan at the [[Durand Line]], {{convert|2430|km|mi|1|abbr=on}}, which runs from the [[Hindu Kush]] and the [[Pamir Mountains]]. A narrow strip of Afghanistan territory called the [[Wakhan Corridor]] extends between Pakistan and [[Tajikistan]]. From the eastern tip of the Wakhan Corridor starts the Sino-Pak border between the [[People's Republic of China]] and Pakistan spanning about {{convert|510|km|mi|1|abbr=on}}. It carries on south-eastward and ends near the [[Karakoram Pass]]. This line was determined from 1961 to 1965 in a series of agreements between China and Pakistan and finally on 03-03-1963 both the governments, of [[Islamabad]] and [[Beijing]], formally agreed. It is understood that if the dispute over Kashmir is resolved, the border would need to be discussed again.<ref name=\"CITEREFPakistanGeography\">{{cite web\n|url=http://countrystudies.us/pakistan/23.htm\n|title=Pakistan: Geography\n|publisher=US Country Studies\n|accessdate=2008-05-05}}</ref>\n\nThe boundary with [[Iran]], {{convert|909|km|mi|1|abbr=on}}, was first delimited by a British commission in the same year as the Durand Line was demarcated, separating Iran from what was then British India's [[Baluchistan (Chief Commissioners Province)|Baluchistan]] province.<ref name=\"CITEREFPakistanGeography\"/> Modern Iran has a province named [[Sistan va Baluchistan]] that borders Pakistan and has [[Baloch people|Baluchis]] in an ethnic majority. In 1957 Pakistan signed a frontier agreement with Iran in [[Rawalpindi]] according to which the border was officially declared and the two countries haven't had this border as a subject of serious dispute at all.\n<!--[[Image:Earthquake Information for Pakistan.gif|thumb|Map depicting tectonic plates shows Indian and Eurasian tectonic plate divide throughout Pakistan and Kashmir where earthquake activity is common.]]-->\nThe [[Northern Areas]] has five of the world's seventeen highest [[mountain|peaks]] along with highest range of mountains the [[Karakoram]] and [[Himalayas]]. It also has such extensive [[glacier]]s that it has sometimes been called the \"[[Siachen Glacier|Third Pole]]\". The international border-line has been a matter of pivotal dispute between Pakistan and India ever since 1947, and the [[Siachen Glacier]] in northern Kashmir has been an important arena for fighting between the two sides since 1984, although far more soldiers have died of exposure to the cold than from any skirmishes in the conflict between their National Armies facing each other.\n\nThe Pakistan-India [[ceasefire]] [[border|line]] runs from the Karakoram Pass west-southwest to a point about 130 kilometers northwest of Lahore. This line, about 770 kilometers long, was arranged with [[United Nations]] (UNO) assistance at the end of the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947\u201348. The ceasefire line came into effect on January 1, 1949, after eighteen months of fighting between Indian forces and Pakistani forces and was last adjusted and agreed upon by the two countries according to the [[Shimla Agreement]] of July 2, 1972 between [[Indira Gandhi]] and [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]]. Since then, it has been generally known as the Line of Control or the (LoC).\n\nThe [[India\u2013Pakistan border]] continues irregularly southward for about 1,280 kilometers, following the [[Radcliffe line]], named for Sir [[Cyril Radcliffe, 1st Viscount Radcliffe|Cyril Radcliffe]], the head of the British Boundary Commission on the division of the [[Punjab Province (British India)|Punjab]] and [[Bengal]] provinces of [[British India]] on 13 August 1947.\n\nThe southern borders are far less contentious than those in northern Pakistan (Kashmir). The Thar Desert in the province of [[Sindh]] is separated in the south from the salt flats of the Rann of Kachchh (Kutch) by a boundary that was first delineated in 1923\u201324. After independence and dissolution of Empire, Independent and free Pakistan contested the southern boundary of Sindh, and a succession of border incidents resulted. They were less dangerous and less widespread, however, than the conflict that erupted in Kashmir in the Indo-Pakistani War of August 1965 started with this decisive core of issues. These southern hostilities were ended by British mediation during Harold Wilson's era, and both sides accepted the award of the Indo-Pakistan Western Boundary Case Tribunal designated by the UN secretary general himself. The tribunal made its award on February 19, 1968; delimiting a line of 403 kilometers that was later demarcated by joint survey teams, Of its original claim of some 9,100 square kilometers, Pakistan was awarded only about 780 square kilometers. Beyond the western terminus of the tribunal's award, the final stretch of Pakistan's border with India is about 80 kilometers long, running east and southeast of Sindh to an inlet of the [[Arabian Sea]].\n\n===Maritime claims===\n;Contiguous zone\n:{{convert|12|nmi}}\n;Continental shelf\n:{{convert|200|nmi}}, or to the edge of the [[continental margin]]\n;[[Exclusive economic zone]]\n:{{convert|290,000|km2|mi2|abbr=on}}\n;Territorial sea\n:{{convert|12|nmi}}\n\n{{Borders of Pakistan}}\n\n==Geographical regions==\n[[Image:Pakistan Topography.png|thumb|Topography of Pakistan]]\nPakistan is divided into three major geographic areas: the northern highlands; the [[Indus River]] plain, with two major subdivisions corresponding roughly to the provinces of [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]] and [[Sindh]]; and the Balochistan [[Plateau]]. Some geographers designate additional major regions. For example, the mountain ranges along the western border with [[Afghanistan]] are sometimes described separately from the Balochistan Plateau, and on the eastern border with India, south of the [[Sutlej River]], the [[Thar Desert]] may be considered separately from the Indus Plain. Nevertheless, the country may conveniently be visualized in general terms as divided in three by an imaginary line drawn eastward from the [[Khyber Pass]] and another drawn southwest from [[Islamabad]] down the middle of the country. Roughly, then, the northern highlands are north of the imaginary east-west line; the Balochistan Plateau is to the west of the imaginary southwest line; and the Indus Plain lies to the east of that line.\n\n===The northern highlands===\nThe northern highlands include parts of the Hindu Kush, the [[Karakoram]] Range, and the [[Himalayas]]. This area includes such famous peaks as [[K2]]<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic-art/312055/69374/K2-in-the-Karakoram-Range-northern-Baltistan-Northern-Areas-Pak K2] \u2013 Britannica.com</ref> (Mount Godwin Austen, at 8,611 meters the second highest peak in the world). More than one-half of the summits are over 4,500 meters, and more than fifty peaks reach above 6,500 meters. Travel through the area is difficult and dangerous, although the government is attempting to develop certain areas into tourist and trekking sites. Because of their rugged topography and the rigors of the climate, the northern highlands and the [[Himalayas]] to the east have been formidable barriers to movement into Pakistan throughout history.\n[[Image:K2 8611.jpg|thumb|[[K2]], at 8,619 metres (28,251 ft), is the world's second highest peak]]\n\nSouth of the northern highlands and west of the [[Indus River]] plain are the Safed Koh Range along the Afghanistan border and the Sulaiman Range and Kirthar Range, which define the western extent of the province of Sindh and reach almost to the southern coast. The lower reaches are far more arid than those in the north, and they branch into ranges that run generally to the southwest across the province Balochistan. North-south valleys in Balochistan and Sindh have restricted the migration of peoples along the Makran Coast on the Arabian Sea east toward the plains.\n\nSeveral large passes cut the ranges along the border with [[Afghanistan]]. Among them are the [[Khojak Pass]], about eighty kilometres northwest of Quetta in Balochistan; the Khyber Pass, forty kilometres west of [[Peshawar]] and leading to [[Kabul]]; and the [[Broghol]] Pass in the far north, providing access to the [[Wakhan Corridor]].\n\nLess than one-fifth of Pakistan's land area has the potential for intensive [[agriculture|agricultural]] use. Nearly all of the arable land is actively cultivated, but outputs are low by world standards. Cultivation is sparse in the northern mountains, the southern deserts, and the western [[plateau]]s, but the [[Indus River]] basin in Punjab and northern Sindh has [[fertility|fertile]] soil that enables Pakistan to feed its population under usual climatic conditions.\n\n===The Indus plain===\n{{Main|Indo-Gangetic plain}}\nThe name Indus comes from the Sanskrit word hindu, meaning ocean, from which also come the words Sindh, Hindu, and India. The Indus, one of the great rivers of the world, rises in southwestern [[Tibet]] only about 160 kilometres west of the source of the [[Sutlej River]], which first flows through [[Punjab, India]] and joins the [[Indus]] in [[Pakistani Punjab]], and the [[Brahmaputra]], which runs eastward before turning southwest and flowing through [[India]] and, [[Bangladesh]]. The catchment area of the Indus is estimated at almost 1 million square kilometres, and all of Pakistan's major rivers\u2014the Kabul, Jhelum and, Chenab\u2014flow into it. The Indus River basin is a large, fertile alluvial plain formed by silt from the Indus. This area has been inhabited by agricultural civilizations for at least 5,000 years.\n\n===Baluchistan===\n[[Image:NEO sulaiman big.jpg|thumb|Satellite image of the Sulaiman Range]]\n{{Main|Balochistan, Pakistan}}\nBalochistan is located at the eastern edge of the Iranian plateau and in the border region between Southwest, Central, and South Asia. It is geographically the largest of the four provinces at 347,190&nbsp;km\u00b2 or (134,051 square miles) of Pakistani territory; and composes 48% of the total land area of Pakistan. The population density is very low due to the mountainous terrain and scarcity of water. The southern region is known as [[Makran]]. The central region is known as [[Kalat (princely state)|Kalat]].\n\nThe [[Sulaiman Mountains]] dominate the northeast corner and the Bolan Pass is a natural route into Afghanistan towards Kandahar. Much of the province south of the [[Quetta]] region is sparse desert terrain with pockets of inhabitable towns mostly near rivers and streams. The largest desert is the [[Kharan Desert]] which occupies the most of [[Kharan District]].\n\nThis area is subject to frequent [[seismology|seismic]] disturbances because the [[plate tectonics|tectonic plate]] under the Indian plate hits the plate under Eurasia as it continues to move northward and to push the Himalayas ever higher. The region surrounding Quetta is highly prone to [[earthquake]]s. A severe quake in 1931 was followed by one of more destructive force in 1935. The small city of [[Quetta]] was almost completely destroyed, and the adjacent military cantonment was heavily damaged. At least 20,000 people were killed. Tremors continue in the vicinity of [[Quetta]]; the most recent major [[october 2005 kashmir earthquake|earthquake]] in which nearly 10,0000 people died and [[2008 Balochistan earthquake|earthquake]]<ref>Center for the Observation and Modeling of Earthquakes and Tectonics (COMET), 2005. Locating the Kashmir Fault, http://comet.nerc.ac. uk/news_kashmir.html</ref> occurred in October 2008 in which 30,000 people were killed. In January 1991 a severe earthquake destroyed entire villages in the [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa]], but far fewer people were killed in the quake than died in 1935. A major earthquake centred in the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa's Kohistan District in 1965 also caused heavy damage.\n\n==Climate==\n{{Main|Climate of Pakistan}}\n[[File:Pakistan map of K\u00f6ppen climate classification.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|Pakistan map of K\u00f6ppen climate classification zones]]\n[[Image:Pakistan.A2005097.0615.1km.jpg|thumb|Dust storm over Pakistan and surrounding countries, April 7, 2005]]\nPakistan lies in the [[temperate]] zone, immediately above the [[tropic of cancer]]. The climate varies from [[tropical]] to temperate. [[Arid]] conditions exist in the coastal south, characterized by a [[monsoon]] season with adequate rainfall and a dry season with lesser rainfall, while abundant rainfall is experienced by the province of [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]], and wide variations between extremes of temperature at given locations. Rainfall varies from as little as less than 10&nbsp;inches a year to over 150&nbsp;inches a year, in various parts of the nation. These generalizations should not, however, obscure the distinct differences existing among particular locations. For example, the coastal area along the Arabian Sea is usually warm, whereas the frozen snow-covered ridges of the [[Karakoram]] Range and of other mountains of the far north are so cold year round that they are only accessible by world-class climbers for a few weeks in May and June of each year.\n\nPakistan has four seasons: a cool, dry winter marked by mild temperatures from December through February; a hot, dry spring from March through May; the summer rainy season, or southwest monsoon period, from June through September; and the retreating monsoon period of October and November. The onset and duration of these seasons vary somewhat according to location.\n\nThe climate in the capital city of [[Islamabad]] varies from an average daily low of {{convert|5|\u00b0C|1}} in January to an average daily high of {{convert|40|\u00b0C}} in June. Half of the annual rainfall occurs in July and August, averaging about {{convert|300|mm|in|2}} in each of those two months. The remainder of the year has significantly less rain, amounting to about {{convert|100|mm|in|2}} per month. [[Hail]]storms are common in early spring.\n\nPakistan's largest city, [[Karachi]], which is also the country's [[Industry|industrial]] center, is more humid than Islamabad but gets significantly lesser rainfall. Only July and August average more than {{convert|50|mm|in|2}} of rainfall in the Karachi area; the remaining months are exceedingly dry with little rainfall. The temperature is also more uniform in Karachi than in Islamabad, ranging from an average daily low of {{convert|13|\u00b0C|1}} during winter evenings to an average daily high of {{convert|34|\u00b0C|1}} on summer days. Although the summer temperatures do not get as high as those in Punjab, the high humidity causes the residents a great deal of discomfort.\n\n===Water resources===\n{{Main|Water resources management in Pakistan}}\n{{Main|Water supply and sanitation in Pakistan}}\nHydrological power is a renewable resource which benefits Pakistan a lot. After the Indus Water Treaty on 1960 World Bank decided that River Sutlej, Ravi and Beas water will be used by India and River Indus, Jhelum and Chenab water will be used by Pakistan. Pakistan was told to build two dams, one tarbela and second Mangla, five barrages, eight link canals, and one gated siphon. For this, India was told to participate 60%, whereas Pakistan, 40%. Pakistan is considering to develop wind turbines to fulfill the demand for electricity. Solar power is now slowly flourishing but it is still installed on a small scale.\n \nPakistan largest river is known as the Indus River which flows from Tibet/China and enters Pakistan through Gilgit Baltistan. The Indus River system is divided into two plains. The Upper Indus Plain starts from northern Pakistan and ends up at Mithankot. The Indus has tributaries on both western and eastern side. The Indus' eastern tributaries are the Jhelum, Chenab, Sutlej, Ravi and Beas. These four rivers flow in Punjab and meet at Panjnad where they are known as Panjnad river. The Indus' western tributaries are the Swat, Kabul, Kurrram, Tochi, Gomal, Zhob rivers. These rivers join the Indus at KPK. At Mithankot these rivers finally meet with the River Indus. After this the Indus flows alone through the Lower Indus Plain. Lower Indus Plain starts from Mithankot up to Thatta where the Indus meets with the Arabian Sea. This place is also known as Indus Delta.\n\n===Fuel resources===\n{{Main|Fuel extraction in Pakistan}}\nPakistan has extensive energy resources, including fairly sizable [[natural gas]] reserves, [[petroleum]] oil reserves, [[coal]] fields and large [[hydropower]] potential.\n\n===Agriculture===\n{{Main|Agriculture in Pakistan}}\nAbout 26% of Pakistan's total land area is under cultivation and is watered by one of the largest irrigation systems in the world. The most important crops are [[tobacco]], [[cotton]], [[wheat]], [[rice]], [[sugarcane]], [[maize]], [[sorghum]], [[millets]], [[pulse]]s, [[vegetable oil|oil seeds]], [[barley]], [[fruit]]s and [[vegetable]]s, which together account for more than 75% of the value of total crop output.<ref>Environment of Pakistan pg213.\"Major crop output\" line 13</ref>\n\n===Fishery===\n{{Main|Fishing in Pakistan}}\n[[Fishery]] and [[fishing industry]] plays an important role in the national economy of [[Pakistan]]. With a coastline of about 1046&nbsp;km, Pakistan has enough fishery resources that remain to be fully developed. It is also a major source of export earning.\n\n===Forestry===\n{{Main|Forestry in Pakistan}}\nAbout only 4.1% of land in Pakistan is covered with forests. The forests of Pakistan are a main source of food, [[lumber]], [[paper]], [[fuel wood]], [[latex]], [[medicinal plant|medicine]] as well as used for purposes of [[wildlife]] conservation and [[Eco tourism]].\n\n===Mining===\n{{Main|Mining in Pakistan}}\nThe Salt Range in the [[Potwar Plateau]] has large deposits of [[rock salt]]. Pakistan has extensive mineral resources, including fairly sizable reserves of [[gypsum]], [[limestone]], [[chromite]]s, [[iron ore]], [[halite|rock salt]], [[silver]], [[gold]], precious stones, [[gemstone|gem]]s, [[marble]]s, [[tile]]s, [[copper]], [[sulfur]], [[fire clay]] and silica sand.\n\n==Environment and conservation==\n{{Main|Environmental issues in Pakistan}}\nThe environmental issues is a great problem for the nature and nation of Pakistan and has been disturbing the balance between economic development and environmental protection. As Pakistan is a large importer of both exhaustible and renewable natural resources and a large consumer of [[fossil fuel]]s, the Ministry of Environment of [[Government of Pakistan]] takes responsibility to conserve and [[Environmentalism|protect the environment]].\n\n'''Current issues''': water pollution from raw sewage, industrial wastes, and agricultural runoff; limited natural fresh water resources; a majority of the population does not have access to potable water; [[deforestation]]; [[soil erosion]]; [[desertification]].\n\n===Natural disasters===\n{{Main|List of natural disasters in Pakistan}}\nPakistan is subject to frequent [[earthquake]]s which are often severe (especially in north and west) and severe [[flood]]ing along the Indus after heavy rains (July and August). [[Landslide]]s are common in the northern mountains.\n\n===Protected areas===\n{{Main|Protected areas of Pakistan}}\nThere are 15 [[National Parks|national parks]], 72 [[Wildlife Sanctuary|wildlife sanctuaries]], 66 [[game reserve]]s, 9 marine and littoral protected areas, 19 protected [[Ramsar convention|wetlands]] and a number of other protected [[grassland]]s, [[shrubland]]s, [[woodland]]s and [[natural monument]]s.\n\n===International agreements===\nPakistan is a party to several international agreements related to environment and climate, the most prominent among them are:\n\n{| width=\"100%\" bgcolor=\"#fff4f4\"\n!align=\"center\" colspan=\"2\"|Treaties and Agreements\n|-align=\"center\"\n!align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"| Specific Regions and [[Sea]]s\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|<small> [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea|Law of the Sea]], Ship Pollution ([[MARPOL 73/78]])</small>\n|-align=\"center\"\n!align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"| [[Earth's atmosphere|Atmosphere]] and [[Climate]]\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|<small>[[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change|Climate Change]], [[Montreal Protocol|Ozone Layer Protection]], [[Partial Test Ban Treaty|Nuclear Test Ban]]</small>\n|-align=\"center\"\n!align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"| [[Biodiversity]], [[environment (biophysical)|Environment]], and [[Forest]]s\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|<small>[[United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification|Desertification]], [[CITES|Endangered Species]], [[Environmental Modification Convention|Environmental Modification]], [[Ramsar Convention|Wetland]]s, [[Convention on Fishing and Conservation of Living Resources of the High Seas|Marine Life Conservation]]</small>\n|-align=\"center\"\n!align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"| [[Waste]]s\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|<small>[[Basel Convention|Hazardous Wastes]]</small>\n|-align=\"center\"\n!align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"| [[River]]s\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|<small>[[Indus Waters Treaty]]</small>\n|}\n\n== Suffix of regions and towns ==\nParts of region and settlement names:\n\n* [[-abad]] ({{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|  \u0640 \u0622\u0628\u0627\u062f }}}}) means settled place.

They discuss the day's latest headlines, while usually tying in the show's theme of motherhood or at least parenthood, such as by giving their opinions \"through the eyes of mothers.\" The show also contains celebrity interviews and segments for mothers and parents in general.\n\n''The Talk'' is broadcast before a live studio audience at the [[CBS Studio Center]] in [[Studio City, California]] each Monday through Friday at 11:00 a.m. [[Pacific Time Zone|Pacific Time]], and airs live on most CBS [[owned-and-operated station]]s and [[network affiliate|affiliates]] in the [[Eastern United States|Eastern]] and [[Central United States]] at 2:00 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time]]. The program is broadcast on [[broadcast delay|tape delay]] elsewhere from the [[Mountain Time Zone]] westward. The Friday shows are recorded on Thursday afternoons at 1:00&nbsp;pm PT for broadcast the next day. Friday shows are taped before the same studio audience in attendance for the earlier live Thursday broadcast.\n\n==Format==\n''The Talk'' has a format similar in style to [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[The View (U.S. TV series)|The View]]''.  The opening segment of the broadcast is known as \"Everybody Talks\" and usually runs a combined 12 to 25 minutes over multiple segments, depending on the number of stories featured and the number of guests.  It is followed by topical discussion segments, involves the five-female host panel discussing current news items, typically focusing on [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] headlines, offbeat stories, and celebrity news. The program also actively incorporates [[social media]] to allow viewers to provide their opinions on the stories discussed through [[Twitter]] (using the hashtag #EverybodyTalks, or alternately the abbreviated #EVBT).  In season five, the program began allowing viewers to use [[Instagram]] to record and upload videos using the aforementioned hashtags, with one or two videos being selected to air on the live broadcasts.<ref>{{cite press release|title=CBS's \"The Talk\" Kicks Off Season 5 Monday, Sept. 8!|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2014/09/02/cbss-the-talk-kicks-off-season-5-monday-sept-8-45010/20140902cbs01/|publisher=CBS|via=The Futon Critic|date=September 2, 2014|accessdate=July 27, 2015}}</ref>\n\nOn most editions, the \"Top Talker\" serves as the final segment of the topical discussion, featuring a rotating set of contributors - most of whom are correspondents/hosts of entertainment-related newsmagazine programs or magazines or hosts of local or syndicated radio programs - providing detailed analysis of a single trending, usually celebrity-related, story. Following the \"Everybody Talks\" segment, all five hosts interview one or two featured celebrity guests; most of these interviews are conducted at the set's roundtable. Musical performances are also occasionally included.\n\nThe show also regularly has a cooking segment two to four times each week, with two of the panelists - rotating between any combination of Chen, Underwood, Gilbert, or Osbourne - assisting in the preparation of the featured recipes with the guest chef. Product giveaways are also done once per week, as part of a segment showcasing fashion/beauty products and electronics that are given away to studio audience members for attending the show, and are often tied into online [[Deal of the day|flash sale]]s where the viewing audience can purchase the products offered at a reduced price.\n\nTo conclude the show through season 9, each episode signed-off with one of the co-hosts, primarily the moderator, saying \"Remember, it's always the right time to have ''The Talk!''\". With the start of season 10 the sign-off \"Let's Talk Tomorrow!\" or \"Let's Talk Later\" (used on Friday) is used.\n\n==Development==\nIn December 2009, CBS announced the cancellation of ''[[As the World Turns]]'' after 54 years, and was looking for a program to replace the long-running [[soap opera]] in its time slot. Sara Gilbert approached CBS about producing a pilot that would feature six women talking about the day's headlines with opinions told through \"the eyes of mothers.\"<ref name = Mothers />\n\nOn July 21, 2010, CBS announced that it had picked up the show (by then, given the title ''The Talk''), beating out several other contenders, including a cooking show featuring [[Emeril Lagasse]]; ''Say It Now'', a talk show featuring [[Valerie Bertinelli]] and [[Rove McManus]]; and a revamped version of the classic game show ''[[Pyramid (game show)|Pyramid]]'', hosted by [[Andy Richter]].<ref name=Mothers>{{cite web|title=Sara Gilbert talk show to replace veteran CBS soap|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2010/07/21/us-gilbert-idUSTRE66K5XA20100721|author=Georg Szalai|agency=[[Reuters]]|accessdate=September 19, 2012|date=July 21, 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn the 4 weeks prior to the show's debut, new episodes of ''[[The Price Is Right (U.S. game show)|The Price Is Right]]'' and ''[[Let's Make a Deal]]'', as well as repeats of ''[[The Young and the Restless]]'', aired in the timeslot vacated by ''As the World Turns''.\n\n==Co-hosts==\n\n=== Timeline ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width:\"100%\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Co-host !!  colspan=10 style=text-align:center; | Seasons\n|-\n!! width=\"80\" | 1 !! width=\"80\" | 2 !! width=\"80\" | 3 !! width=\"80\" | 4 !! width=\"80\" | 5 !! width=\"80\"| 6 !! width=\"80\" | 7 !! width=\"80\" |8 !! width=\"80\" | 9 !! width=\"80\" | 10\n|-\n| {{nowrap|[[Julie Chen]]}} || colspan=\"8\" {{yes|}} || colspan=\"2\" {{n/a|}}\n|-\n| {{nowrap|[[Sara Gilbert]]}} || colspan=\"9\" {{yes|}} || colspan=\"1\" {{n/a|}}\n|-\n| {{nowrap|[[Sharon Osbourne]]}} || colspan=\"10\" {{yes|}}\n|-\n| {{nowrap|[[Marissa Jaret Winokur]]}} || colspan=\"1\" {{yes|}} || colspan=\"9\" {{n/a|}}\n|-\n| {{nowrap|[[Holly Robinson Peete]]}} || colspan=\"1\" {{yes|}} || colspan=\"9\" {{n/a|}}\n|-\n| {{nowrap|[[Leah Remini]]}} || colspan=\"1\" {{yes|}} || colspan=\"9\" {{n/a|}}\n|-\n| {{nowrap|[[Aisha Tyler]]}} || colspan=\"1\" {{n/a|}} || colspan=\"6\" {{yes|}} || colspan=\"3\" {{n/a|}}\n|-\n| {{nowrap|[[Sheryl Underwood]]}} || colspan=\"1\" {{n/a|}} || colspan=\"9\" {{yes|}}\n|-\n| {{nowrap|[[Eve (rapper)|Eve]]}} || colspan=\"7\" {{n/a|}} || colspan=\"3\" {{yes|}}\n|-\n| {{nowrap|[[Carrie Ann Inaba]]}} || colspan=\"8\" {{n/a|}} || colspan=\"2\" {{yes|}}\n|-\n| {{nowrap|[[Marie Osmond]]}} || colspan=\"9\" {{n/a|}} || colspan=\"1\" {{yes|}}\n|}\n\n===Season 1===\nThe original panel consisted of [[Sara Gilbert]], known for her role on the TV series ''[[Roseanne]]''; [[Holly Robinson Peete]], known for her roles on the TV series ''[[21 Jump Street]]'' and ''[[Hangin' with Mr. Cooper]]''; [[Leah Remini]], known for her role as Carrie Heffernan in the 1998\u20132007 CBS sitcom ''[[The King of Queens]]''; ''[[Big Brother (U.S.)|Big Brother]]'' hostess [[Julie Chen]]; and former talk show hostess/''[[The X Factor (UK TV series)|X Factor]]'' judge [[Sharon Osbourne]], the wife of rocker [[Ozzy Osbourne]].

They discuss the day's latest headlines, while usually tying in the show's theme of motherhood or at least parenthood, such as by giving their opinions \"through the eyes of mothers.\" The show also contains celebrity interviews and segments for mothers and parents in general.\n\n''The Talk'' is broadcast before a live studio audience at the [[CBS Studio Center]] in [[Studio City, California]] each Monday through Friday at 11:00 a.m. [[Pacific Time Zone|Pacific Time]], and airs live on most CBS [[owned-and-operated station]]s and [[network affiliate|affiliates]] in the [[Eastern United States|Eastern]] and [[Central United States]] at 2:00 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time]]. The program is broadcast on [[broadcast delay|tape delay]] elsewhere from the [[Mountain Time Zone]] westward. The Friday shows are recorded on Thursday afternoons at 1:00&nbsp;pm PT for broadcast the next day. Friday shows are taped before the same studio audience in attendance for the earlier live Thursday broadcast.\n\n==Format==\n''The Talk'' has a format similar in style to [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[The View (U.S. TV series)|The View]]''.  The opening segment of the broadcast is known as \"Everybody Talks\" and usually runs a combined 12 to 25 minutes over multiple segments, depending on the number of stories featured and the number of guests.  It is followed by topical discussion segments, involves the five-female host panel discussing current news items, typically focusing on [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] headlines, offbeat stories, and celebrity news. The program also actively incorporates [[social media]] to allow viewers to provide their opinions on the stories discussed through [[Twitter]] (using the hashtag #EverybodyTalks, or alternately the abbreviated #EVBT).  In season five, the program began allowing viewers to use [[Instagram]] to record and upload videos using the aforementioned hashtags, with one or two videos being selected to air on the live broadcasts.<ref>{{cite press release|title=CBS's \"The Talk\" Kicks Off Season 5 Monday, Sept. 8!|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2014/09/02/cbss-the-talk-kicks-off-season-5-monday-sept-8-45010/20140902cbs01/|publisher=CBS|via=The Futon Critic|date=September 2, 2014|accessdate=July 27, 2015}}</ref>\n\nOn most editions, the \"Top Talker\" serves as the final segment of the topical discussion, featuring a rotating set of contributors - most of whom are correspondents/hosts of entertainment-related newsmagazine programs or magazines or hosts of local or syndicated radio programs - providing detailed analysis of a single trending, usually celebrity-related, story. Following the \"Everybody Talks\" segment, all five hosts interview one or two featured celebrity guests; most of these interviews are conducted at the set's roundtable. Musical performances are also occasionally included.\n\nThe show also regularly has a cooking segment two to four times each week, with two of the panelists - rotating between any combination of Chen, Underwood, Gilbert, or Osbourne - assisting in the preparation of the featured recipes with the guest chef. Product giveaways are also done once per week, as part of a segment showcasing fashion/beauty products and electronics that are given away to studio audience members for attending the show, and are often tied into online [[Deal of the day|flash sale]]s where the viewing audience can purchase the products offered at a reduced price.\n\nTo conclude the show through season 9, each episode signed-off with one of the co-hosts, primarily the moderator, saying \"Remember, it's always the right time to have ''The Talk!''\". With the start of season 10 the sign-off \"Let's Talk Tomorrow!\" or \"Let's Talk Later\" (used on Friday) is used.\n\n==Development==\nIn December 2009, CBS announced the cancellation of ''[[As the World Turns]]'' after 54 years, and was looking for a program to replace the long-running [[soap opera]] in its time slot. Sara Gilbert approached CBS about producing a pilot that would feature six women talking about the day's headlines with opinions told through \"the eyes of mothers.\"<ref name = Mothers />\n\nOn July 21, 2010, CBS announced that it had picked up the show (by then, given the title ''The Talk''), beating out several other contenders, including a cooking show featuring [[Emeril Lagasse]]; ''Say It Now'', a talk show featuring [[Valerie Bertinelli]] and [[Rove McManus]]; and a revamped version of the classic game show ''[[Pyramid (game show)|Pyramid]]'', hosted by [[Andy Richter]].<ref name=Mothers>{{cite web|title=Sara Gilbert talk show to replace veteran CBS soap|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2010/07/21/us-gilbert-idUSTRE66K5XA20100721|author=Georg Szalai|agency=[[Reuters]]|accessdate=September 19, 2012|date=July 21, 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn the 4 weeks prior to the show's debut, new episodes of ''[[The Price Is Right (U.S. game show)|The Price Is Right]]'' and ''[[Let's Make a Deal]]'', as well as repeats of ''[[The Young and the Restless]]'', aired in the timeslot vacated by ''As the World Turns''.\n\n==Co-hosts==\n\n=== Timeline ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width:\"100%\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Co-host !!  colspan=10 style=text-align:center; | Seasons\n|-\n!! width=\"80\" | 1 !! width=\"80\" | 2 !! width=\"80\" | 3 !! width=\"80\" | 4 !! width=\"80\" | 5 !! width=\"80\"| 6 !! width=\"80\" | 7 !! width=\"80\" |8 !! width=\"80\" | 9 !! width=\"80\" | 10\n|-\n| {{nowrap|[[Julie Chen]]}} || colspan=\"8\" {{yes|}} || colspan=\"2\" {{n/a|}}\n|-\n| {{nowrap|[[Sara Gilbert]]}} || colspan=\"9\" {{yes|}} || colspan=\"1\" {{n/a|}}\n|-\n| {{nowrap|[[Sharon Osbourne]]}} || colspan=\"10\" {{yes|}}\n|-\n| {{nowrap|[[Marissa Jaret Winokur]]}} || colspan=\"1\" {{yes|}} || colspan=\"9\" {{n/a|}}\n|-\n| {{nowrap|[[Holly Robinson Peete]]}} || colspan=\"1\" {{yes|}} || colspan=\"9\" {{n/a|}}\n|-\n| {{nowrap|[[Leah Remini]]}} || colspan=\"1\" {{yes|}} || colspan=\"9\" {{n/a|}}\n|-\n| {{nowrap|[[Aisha Tyler]]}} || colspan=\"1\" {{n/a|}} || colspan=\"6\" {{yes|}} || colspan=\"3\" {{n/a|}}\n|-\n| {{nowrap|[[Sheryl Underwood]]}} || colspan=\"1\" {{n/a|}} || colspan=\"9\" {{yes|}}\n|-\n| {{nowrap|[[Eve (rapper)|Eve]]}} || colspan=\"7\" {{n/a|}} || colspan=\"3\" {{yes|}}\n|-\n| {{nowrap|[[Carrie Ann Inaba]]}} || colspan=\"8\" {{n/a|}} || colspan=\"2\" {{yes|}}\n|-\n| {{nowrap|[[Marie Osmond]]}} || colspan=\"9\" {{n/a|}} || colspan=\"1\" {{yes|}}\n|}\n\n===Season 1===\nThe original panel consisted of [[Sara Gilbert]], known for her role on the TV series ''[[Roseanne]]''; [[Holly Robinson Peete]], known for her roles on the TV series ''[[21 Jump Street]]'' and ''[[Hangin' with Mr. Cooper]]''; [[Leah Remini]], known for her role as Carrie Heffernan in the 1998\u20132007 CBS sitcom ''[[The King of Queens]]''; ''[[Big Brother (U.S.)|Big Brother]]'' hostess [[Julie Chen]]; and former talk show hostess/''[[The X Factor (UK TV series)|X Factor]]'' judge [[Sharon Osbourne]], the wife of rocker [[Ozzy Osbourne]].

However some species are omnivorous, like raccoons and bears, and quite few species like [[panda]]s are specialized herbivores. Its members are formally referred to as '''carnivorans''', whereas the word \"carnivore\" (often popularly applied to members of this group) can refer to any meat-eating organism. With at least 279 extant species found on every major landmass and in a variety of habitats, ranging the cold polar regions to the hyper-arid region of the [[Sahara Desert]] to the open seas even, Carnivora is the fifth largest order of mammals and one of the more successful members of the group. They come in a huge array of different body plans in contrasting shapes and sizes.  The smallest carnivoran is the [[least weasel]] (''Mustela nivalis''), which can weigh as little as 25 g (0.88&nbsp;oz) and 11&nbsp;cm (4.3&nbsp;in), as the largest is the [[southern elephant seal]] (''Mirounga leonina''), whose adult males weigh up to 5,000&nbsp;kg (11,000&nbsp;lb) and measure up to 6.7&nbsp;m (22&nbsp;ft) in length. All species of carnivorans are descended from a group of mammals which were related to today's [[pangolin]]s, having appeared in [[North America]] 6 million years after the [[Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event]].<ref name=\"hunter2018\"/><ref name=Polly/> These early ancestors of carnivorans would have resembled small weasel or genet-like mammals, occupying a nocturnal shift on the forest floor or in the trees, as other groups of mammals like the [[mesonychian]]s and [[creodont]]s were occupying the top faunivorous niche. However, by the time [[Miocene]] epoch appeared, most if not all of the major lineages and families of carnivorans had diversified and took over this niche.\n\nCarnivora can be divided into two subclades: the cat-like [[Feliformia]] and the dog-like [[Caniformia]] which are differentiated based on the structure of their ear bones and cranial features. The feliforms include families such as the [[cat]]s, the [[hyena]]s, the [[mongoose]]s and the [[civet]]s. Majority of feliform species are found in the [[Old World]], though the cats and [[Chasmaporthetes|one extinct genus of hyena]] have successfully diversified into the [[Americas]]. The caniforms include the [[Canidae|dog]]s, [[bear]]s, [[raccoon]]s, [[weasel]]s, and [[pinniped]]s. Members of this group are found worldwide and with incredible diversity in their diet, behavior, and morphology. Despite this the two groups of carnivorans share several unique traits, one being the presence of the [[carnassial]] teeth. In carnivorans the carnassial pair is made up by the fourth upper premolar and the first lower molar teeth. There is variation among the carnassial pair depending on the family. Some species are [[cursorial]] and the foot posture in terrestrial species is either [[digitigrade]] or [[plantigrade]]. In pinnipeds the feet have become flippers where the locomotion is unique in each of the pinniped families.\n\nCarnivorans are arguably after primates the group of mammals most fascinated or of interest to humans. The [[dog]] is noteworthy for not only being the first species of carnivoran to be domesticated, but also the first species of any organism. In the last 10 to 12,000 years humans have selectively bred dogs for a variety of different tasks and today there are well over 400 breeds. The [[cat]] is another domesticated carnivoran and it is today considered one of the most successful species on the planet, due to their close proximity to humans and the popularity of cats as pets. Many other species popular, often part of the [[charismatic megafauna]] where every major civilization has incorporated a species of carnivoran into their culture such as the [[lion]], viewed as royalty. Yet many species such as [[wolves]] and the [[big cat]]s have been hunted and persecution, with some places they have been extirpated. Habitat loss and human encroachment as well as [[climate change]] have been the primary cause of many species to go into decline. Most species need large adequate amount of territory and plenty of food resources in order to survive, and the decline of both of them are the primary reasons of decline. Four species of carnivorans have gone extinct since the 1600s: [[Falkland Island Wolf]] (''Dusicyon australis'') in 1876; the [[Sea Mink]] (''Neovison macrodon'') in 1894; the [[Japanese Sea Lion]] (''Zalophus japonicus'') in 1951 and the [[Caribbean Monk Seal]] (''Neomonachus tropicalis'') in 1952.<ref name=\"hunter2018\">{{cite book | last1 = Hunter | first1 = L. | year = 2018 | title = Field Guide to Carnivores of the World.  | url = | publisher = Bloomsbury Wildlife | pages = 1\u2013271 |isbn = 1472950798}}</ref> Some species such as the [[red fox]] (''Vulpes vulpes'') and [[stoat]] (''Mustela erminea'') have been introduced to [[Australasia]] that have caused many native species to become endangered or even extinct.<ref>{{cite web|title= 100 of the World's Worst Invasive Species | url = http://www.issg.org/database/species/ecology.asp?si=98&fr=1&sts=&lang=EN |publisher=Invasive Species Specialist Group}}</ref>\n\n==Systematics==\n===Evolution===\n[[Image:Tapocyon robustus.jpg|thumb|Life reconstruction of ''[[Tapocyon]] robustus'', a species of [[Miacidae|miacid]]]]\n\nThe order Carnivora belongs to a group of mammals known as [[Laurasiatheria]], which also includes other groups such as [[bat]]s and [[ungulate]]s.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Waddell | first1 = Peter J.| last2 = Okada | first2 = Norihiro| last3 = Hasegawa | first3 = Masami| doi = 10.1093/sysbio/48.1.1 | title = Towards Resolving the Interordinal Relationships of Placental Mammals | journal = [[Systematic Biology]] | volume = 48 | issue = 1 | pages = 1\u20135 | year = 1999 | pmid = 12078634| pmc = | doi-access = free }}</ref><ref name=Tsagkogeorga2013>{{cite journal |last1=Tsagkogeorga |first1=G |last2=Parker |first2=J |last3=Stupka |first3=E |last4=Cotton |first4=J.A. |last5=Rossiter |first5=S.J. |year=2013 |title=Phylogenomic analyses elucidate the evolutionary relationships of bats |journal=Current Biology |volume=23 |issue=22 |pages=2262\u20132267 |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2013.09.014 |pmid=24184098|doi-access=free }}</ref> Within this group the carnivorans are placed in the clade [[Ferae]].

The miacoids were small, gennet-like carnivoramorphs that occupy a variety of niches such as terrestrial and arboreal habitats. Recent studies have shown a supporting amount of evidence that Miacoidea is an evolutionary grade of canivoramorphs that, while viverravids are monophyletic basal group, the miacids are paraphyletic in respect to Carnivora (as shown in the phylogeny below).<ref name = Bryant2004>Bryant, H.N., and M.

The canines are thick and incredibly stress resistant.

In terrestrial carnivorans the feet have soft pads. The feet can either be [[digitgrade]] seen in cats, hyenas and dogs or [[plantigrade]] seen in bears, skunks, raccoons, weasels, civets and mongooses. In pinnipeds the limbs have been modified into [[Flipper (anatomy)|flippers]]. Unlike other [[marine mammal]]s, such as [[cetacean]]s and [[sirenian]]s which have fully functional [[tail]]s to help them swim, pinnipeds use their limbs underwater for [[Animal locomotion|locomotion]]. In [[earless seal]]s they use their back flippers; sea lions and fur seals use their front flippers, and the [[walrus]] use all of their limbs. This resulted in pinnipeds having significantly shorter tails. Aside from the pinnipeds, dogs, bears, hyenas, and cats have distinct and recognizable appearances. Dogs are usually [[cursorial]] mammals and are gracile in appearance, often relying on their teeth to hold to prey; bears are much larger and rely on their physical strength to forage for food. Cats in comparison to dogs and bears have much longer and stronger frontlimbs armed with retractable [[claws]] to hold on to prey. Hyenas are dog-like feliforms that have sloping backs due to their front legs being longer than their hindlegs. The raccoon family as well as the [[red panda]] are small, bear-like carnivorans with long tails. The other small carnivoran families [[Nandiniidae]], [[Prionodontidae]], [[Viverridae]], [[Herpestidae]], Eupleridae, [[Mephitidae]] and Mustelidae have through [[convergent evolution]] maintained the small, ancestral appearance of the miacoids, though there is some variation seen such as the robust and stout physicality of [[badger]]s and the [[wolverine]] (''Gulo gulo'').<ref name=\"WalkersCarnivores\"/>\n\nDepending on the environment the species is, the length and density of their [[fur]] varies. In warm climate species the fur is often short in length and lighter. In comparison to cold climate species the fur is either dense or long, often with an oily substance to keep them warm. The pelage coloration comes in many colors, often including black, white, orange, yellow, red, and many shades of gray and brown. There can be colored patterns too, such striped, spotted, blotched, banded, or otherwise boldly patterned. There seems to be a correlation between habitat and color pattern as for example spotted or banded species tend to be found in heavily forested environments.<ref name=\"WalkersCarnivores\"/> Some species like the grey wolf is a [[polymorphism (biology)|polymorphic]] species with different individual variation in colors. The [[arctic fox]] (''Vulpes lagopus'') and the [[stoat]] (''Mustela erminea'') the fur goes from white and dense in the winter to brown and sparse in the summer. In pinnipeds, [[polar bear]]s, and sea otters have a thick insulating layer of blubber to help maintain their body temperature.\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[List of carnivorans by population]]\n* [[List of species in order Carnivora]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikispecies|Carnivora}}\n{{Wikibooks|Dichotomous Key|Carnivora}}\n{{EB1911 poster|Carnivora}}\n* [http://brainmaps.org/index.php?p=datasets-species#carnivore High-Resolution Images of Carnivore Brains]{{cbignore|bot=medic}}\n\n{{Mammals}}\n{{Carnivora}}\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q25306}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Carnivorans| ]]\n[[Category:Mammal orders]]\n[[Category:Extant Lutetian first appearances]]\n[[Category:Taxa named by Thomas Edward Bowdich]]\n", "text_old": "{{About||information on all meat-eating organisms|Carnivore|the alternative medicine \"Carnivora\"|Venus flytrap#In alternative medicine}}\n{{more footnotes|date=August 2015}}\n{{Automatic taxobox\n|name = Carnivorans\n|fossil_range = {{Geological range|42|0}}[[Middle Eocene]]-[[Holocene]]<ref name=Heinrich2008/>\n|image = <imagemap>\nFile:Carnivora_portraits.jpg|300px\nrect 580 485 0 0 [[Cheetah]]\nrect 582 0 1191 485 [[Grizzly bear]]\n\nrect 0 486 577 972 [[Spotted Hyaena]]\nrect 581 487 1190 971 [[Wolf]]\n\nrect 0 975 577 1387 [[Binturong]]\nrect 582 974 1190 1388 [[Raccoon]]\n\nrect 0 1392 577 1805 [[Indian grey mongoose]]\nrect 581 1391 1188 1807 [[American mink]]\n\nrect 0 1811 577 2231 [[Fossa (animal)|Fossa]]\nrect 581 1810 1190 2231 [[Walrus]]\n</imagemap>\n\n|image_upright = 1.15\n|image_caption = Various carnivorans, with [[feliform]]s to the left, and [[caniform]]s to the right\n|taxon = Carnivora\n|authority = [[Thomas Edward Bowdich|Bowdich]], 1821<ref name=\"Bowditch, T.

However some species are omnivorous, like raccoons and bears, and quite few species like [[panda]]s are specialized herbivores. Its members are formally referred to as '''carnivorans''', whereas the word \"carnivore\" (often popularly applied to members of this group) can refer to any meat-eating organism. With at least 279 extant species found on every major landmass and in a variety of habitats, ranging the cold polar regions to the hyper-arid region of the [[Sahara Desert]] to the open seas even, Carnivora is the fifth largest order of mammals and one of the more successful members of the group. They come in a huge array of different body plans in contrasting shapes and sizes.  The smallest carnivoran is the [[least weasel]] (''Mustela nivalis''), which can weigh as little as 25 g (0.88&nbsp;oz) and 11&nbsp;cm (4.3&nbsp;in), as the largest is the [[southern elephant seal]] (''Mirounga leonina''), whose adult males weigh up to 5,000&nbsp;kg (11,000&nbsp;lb) and measure up to 6.7&nbsp;m (22&nbsp;ft) in length. All species of carnivorans are descended from a group of mammals which were related to today's [[pangolin]]s, having appeared in [[North America]] 6 million years after the [[Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event]].<ref name=\"hunter2018\"/><ref name=Polly/> These early ancestors of carnivorans would have resembled small weasel or genet-like mammals, occupying a nocturnal shift on the forest floor or in the trees, as other groups of mammals like the [[mesonychian]]s and [[creodont]]s were occupying the top faunivorous niche. However, by the time [[Miocene]] epoch appeared, most if not all of the major lineages and families of carnivorans had diversified and took over this niche.\n\nCarnivora can be divided into two subclades: the cat-like [[Feliformia]] and the dog-like [[Caniformia]] which are differentiated based on the structure of their ear bones and cranial features. The feliforms include families such as the [[cat]]s, the [[hyena]]s, the [[mongoose]]s and the [[civet]]s. Majority of feliform species are found in the [[Old World]], though the cats and [[Chasmaporthetes|one extinct genus of hyena]] have successfully diversified into the [[Americas]]. The caniforms include the [[Canidae|dog]]s, [[bear]]s, [[raccoon]]s, [[weasel]]s, and [[pinniped]]s. Members of this group are found worldwide and with incredible diversity in their diet, behavior, and morphology. Despite this the two groups of carnivorans share several unique traits, one being the presence of the [[carnassial]] teeth. In carnivorans the carnassial pair is made up by the fourth upper premolar and the first lower molar teeth. There is variation among the carnassial pair depending on the family. Some species are [[cursorial]] and the foot posture in terrestrial species is either [[digitigrade]] or [[plantigrade]]. In pinnipeds the feet have become flippers where the locomotion is unique in each of the pinniped families.\n\nCarnivorans are arguably after primates the group of mammals most fascinated or of interest to humans. The [[dog]] is noteworthy for not only being the first species of carnivoran to be domesticated, but also the first species of any organism. In the last 10 to 12,000 years humans have selectively bred dogs for a variety of different tasks and today there are well over 400 breeds. The [[cat]] is another domesticated carnivoran and it is today considered one of the most successful species on the planet, due to their close proximity to humans and the popularity of cats as pets. Many other species popular, often part of the [[charismatic megafauna]] where every major civilization has incorporated a species of carnivoran into their culture such as the [[lion]], viewed as royalty. Yet many species such as [[wolves]] and the [[big cat]]s have been hunted and persecution, with some places they have been extirpated. Habitat loss and human encroachment as well as [[climate change]] have been the primary cause of many species to go into decline. Most species need large adequate amount of territory and plenty of food resources in order to survive, and the decline of both of them are the primary reasons of decline.

The canines are thick and incredibly stress resistant. All of the terrestrial species of carnivorans have three [[incisor]]s on the top and bottom row of the dentition (the exception being is the [[sea otter]] (''Enhydra lutris'') which only has two lower incisor teeth).<ref name=\"WalkersCarnivores\"/><ref name=\"MammalogyCarnivores\"/> The third [[molar (tooth)|molar]] has been lost. The carnassial pair is made up by the fourth upper premolar and the first lower molar teeth. Like most mammals the dentition is [[heterodont]] in nature, though in some species like the [[aardwolf]] (''Proteles cristata'') the teeth have been greatly reduced and the cheek teeth are specialised for eating insects. In pinnipeds the teeth are [[homodont]] as they have evolved to grasp or to catch fish, and the cheek teeth are often lost.<ref name=\"MammalogyCarnivores\"/> In bears and raccoons the carnassial pair is secondarily reduced.<ref name=\"MammalogyCarnivores\"/> The skulls are heavily built with a strong [[zygomatic arch]].<ref name=\"MammalogyCarnivores\"/> Often a [[sagittal crest]] is present, sometimes more evident in sexual dimorphic species like [[sea lion]]s and [[fur seal]]s, though it has also been greatly reduced seen in some small carnivorans.<ref name=\"MammalogyCarnivores\">{{cite book | last1 = Vaughan | first1 = T.

In terrestrial carnivorans the feet have soft pads. The feet can either be [[digitgrade]] seen in cats, hyenas and dogs or [[plantigrade]] seen in bears, skunks, raccoons, weasels, civets and mongooses. In pinnipeds the limbs have been modified into [[flippers]]. Unlike other [[marine mammal]]s, such as [[cetacean]]s and [[sirenian]]s which have fully functional [[tail]]s to help them swim, pinnipeds use their limbs underwater for [[Animal locomotion|locomotion]]. In [[earless seal]]s they use their back flippers; sea lions and fur seals use their front flippers, and the [[walrus]] use all of their limbs. This resulted in pinnipeds having significantly shorter tails. Aside from the pinnipeds, dogs, bears, hyenas, and cats have distinct and recognizable appearances. Dogs are usually [[cursorial]] mammals and are gracile in appearance, often relying on their teeth to hold to prey; bears are much larger and rely on their physical strength to forage for food. Cats in comparison to dogs and bears have much longer and stronger frontlimbs armed with retractable [[claws]] to hold on to prey. Hyenas are dog-like feliforms that have sloping backs due to their front legs being longer than their hindlegs. The raccoon family as well as the [[red panda]] are small, bear-like carnivorans with long tails. The other small carnivoran families [[Nandiniidae]], [[Prionodontidae]], [[Viverridae]], [[Herpestidae]], Eupleridae, [[Mephitidae]] and Mustelidae have through [[convergent evolution]] maintained the small, ancestral appearance of the miacoids, though there is some variation seen such as the robust and stout physicality of [[badger]]s and the [[wolverine]] (''Gulo gulo'').<ref name=\"WalkersCarnivores\"/>\n\nDepending on the environment the species is, the length and density of their [[fur]] varies. In warm climate species the fur is often short in length and lighter. In comparison to cold climate species the fur is either dense or long, often with an oily substance to keep them warm. The pelage coloration comes in many colors, often including black, white, orange, yellow, red, and many shades of gray and brown. There can be colored patterns too, such striped, spotted, blotched, banded, or otherwise boldly patterned. There seems to be a correlation between habitat and color pattern as for example spotted or banded species tend to be found in heavily forested environments.<ref name=\"WalkersCarnivores\"/> Some species like the grey wolf is a [[polymorphism (biology)|polymorphic]] species with different individual variation in colors. The [[arctic fox]] (''Vulpes lagopus'') and the [[stoat]] (''Mustela erminea'') the fur goes from white and dense in the winter to brown and sparse in the summer. In pinnipeds, [[polar bear]]s, and sea otters have a thick insulating layer of blubber to help maintain their body temperature.\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[List of carnivorans by population]]\n* [[List of species in order Carnivora]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikispecies|Carnivora}}\n{{Wikibooks|Dichotomous Key|Carnivora}}\n{{EB1911 poster|Carnivora}}\n* [http://brainmaps.org/index.php?p=datasets-species#carnivore High-Resolution Images of Carnivore Brains]{{cbignore|bot=medic}}\n\n{{Mammals}}\n{{Carnivora}}\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q25306}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Carnivorans| ]]\n[[Category:Mammal orders]]\n[[Category:Extant Lutetian first appearances]]\n[[Category:Taxa named by Thomas Edward Bowdich]]\n", "name_user": "Rodw", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguating links toFlipper(link changed toFlipper (anatomy)) usingDisamAssist.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnivora"}

After graduating from Antsla Secondary School in 1970, he started studying at the [[Tallinn University of Technology|Tallinn Polytechnic Institute's Department of Engineering]]. He graduated as an Electrical Engineer in 1975. Between 1975 and 1977, he worked as an Electrical Engineer in [[M\u00e4rjamaa]].\n\n==Ordained ministry==\nAlthough he grew up in a religious family where his father was a clergyman, in the fall of 1972 he refrained from involving in any religious aspects. Until then, his life had been closely associated with church and music. Nevertheless, in 1977 he enrolled at the [[Institute of Theology of the Estonian Evangelical Lutheran Church]] to study theology from where he graduated on January 6, 1987. He was ordained priest on September 6, 1978. Throughout the years Luhamets has been involved in music, playing the instrument and singing as an integral part of his spiritual work. After ordination, he was assigned as pastor of the congregations in [[Kuressaare]] where he till 1989. He later became pastor of [[P\u00f5ltsamaa]] Church and in 1991 became Dean of the Viljandi deanery.
