Starting his career at the now-defunct game company [[Cavia (company)|Cavia]], he became known for his work on the [[action role-playing video game]] series ''[[Drakengard]]'' and its two spin-offs: ''[[Nier (video game)|Nier]]'' and its sequel, ''[[Nier: Automata]]''. Yoko was born in [[Nagoya]], [[Aichi Prefecture|Aichi]], and studied at the [[Kobe Design University]] in the 1990s. While initially not intending to pursue a career in video games, after working at Namco and Sony, he joined Cavia and became the director and scenario writer for the first ''Drakengard'' game. He has since worked extensively on every game in the series (except ''Drakengard 2''), as well as on mobile titles after becoming a freelancer after Cavia's absorption into [[AQ Interactive]].\n\nYoko has become known for his style of game design, incorporating unconventional design choices and stories. One of the main aspects of his work is exploring the darker aspects of people, such as why they are driven to kill each other, although he typically does not share a common opinion on his story's dark natures.

Starting his career at the now-defunct game company [[Cavia (company)|Cavia]], he became known for his work on the [[action role-playing video game]] series ''[[Drakengard]]'' and its two spin-offs: ''[[Nier (video game)|Nier]]'' and its sequel, ''[[Nier: Automata]]''. Yoko was born in [[Nagoya]], [[Aichi Prefecture|Aichi]], and studied at the [[Kobe Design University]] in the 1990s. While initially not intending to pursue a career in video games, after working at Namco and Sony, he joined Cavia and became the director and scenario writer for the first ''Drakengard'' game. He has since worked extensively on every game in the series (except ''Drakengard 2''), as well as on mobile titles after becoming a freelancer after Cavia's absorption into [[AQ Interactive]].\n\nYoko has become known for his style of game design, incorporating unconventional design choices and stories. One of the main aspects of his work is exploring the darker aspects of people, such as why they are driven to kill each other, although he typically does not share a common opinion on his story's dark natures. His writing technique, described as \"backwards scriptwriting,\" involves outlining the ending of the story first and building the narrative backward from that point. Due to his disdain from being photographed, he generally wears a mask when giving interviews or presenting games.\n\n==Biography==\nYoko Taro was born in [[Nagoya]], [[Aichi Prefecture|Aichi]], on June 6, 1970.<ref name=\"BukkoroYoko\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bukkoro.com/about_member.html|title=BUKKORO / ABOUT|publisher=Bukkoro.com|accessdate=2014-07-26|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140726100840/http://www.bukkoro.com/_about/index.html|archivedate=2014-07-26|url-status=live}}</ref> Yoko's parents were often absent at their jobs, so he was mostly raised by his grandmother, who left a strong impression on him.<ref name=\"YokoFamily\">{{cite web|url=http://ameblo.jp/yokota6/entry-11503448652.html|title=\u3010\u65e5\u8a18\u3011\u304a\u3070\u3042\u3061\u3083\u3093\u304c\u6b7b\u3093\u3060\u3002|publisher=Diary of Taro Yoko (blog)|last=Yoko|first=Taro|date=2013-04-02|accessdate=2014-07-26}}</ref> During his youth, he heard about an incident that would influence his later work as a scenario writer: while an acquaintance was in a shopping street with a group of friends, one of them who was walking along a high building roof slipped and died from the fall.

It is also referred to as '''[[biohazard]] remediation''', and '''forensic cleanup''', because crime scenes are only a portion of the situations in which biohazard cleaning is needed. Incidents which may require this type of cleanup include accidents, [[suicide]] (or attempted suicide), [[homicide]]s, and [[decomposition]] after unattended death, as well as mass trauma, [[industrial accident]]s, infectious disease contamination, animal biohazard contamination (e.g. [[feces]] or blood) or [[Hazardous waste|regulated waste]] transport, treatment, and disposal.\n\n==Usage==\nTelevision productions like ''[[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation]]'' have added to the popularity of the term \"crime scene cleanup\". Australia, Canada and England have added it to their professional cleaning terminology.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.csc-scc.gc.ca/publications/005007-5503-eng.shtml |title= Satisfying Justice: A compendium of initiatives, programs and legislative measures|author=<!--Not stated--> |date=15 Aug 2008 |website=csc-scc.gc.ca |publisher= [[Correctional Service of Canada|Correctional Services Canada]]|access-date= 25 Mar 2018}}</ref> As a profession, it is growing in popularity because of media exposure and the growth of training programs worldwide.<ref>{{cite news |last=Gregory |first= Ted|date=16 Aug 2016 |title=Business is booming for crime-scene cleaners |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-crime-scene-cleaners-met-20160814-story.html |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |location= Chicago, IL, USA|access-date= 25 Mar 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe generic terms for ''crime scene cleanup'' include trauma [[cleaner|cleaning]], crime and trauma scene [[decontamination]] (\"CTS Decon\"), [[biohazard]] remediation, [[biohazard]] removal, and [[blood]] cleanup.

There are many different sub-segments, named primarily after additional collateral, contingency, or preconditions, regarding the presence of non-blood borne organics, toxic irritants (e.g., tear gas) or [[disease vector]]s. However, it is the legality of charging a fee for mitigating potentially harmful biohazard situations that differentiates a registered crime or trauma practitioner from any general restoration, carpet cleaning, janitorial or housekeeping service.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.inc.com/aj-agrawal/3-dirty-markets-that-produce-big-time-dollars.html|title=3 Dirty Markets That Produce Big Time Dollars|date=22 January 2016|accessdate=30 January 2016|work=Inc.com|author=AJ Agarwal}}</ref>\n\n\n'''Corona Virus and Pathogen Disinfection'''\nWith concerns about [[Ebola]] contamination in the United States in the past and now with the outbreak of the [[Corona virus]] [[covid-19]] crime scene cleanup companies such as Exit Biohazard and Crime Scene Cleanup http://exitcleanup.com located in the New Orleans area of Louisiana a hot spot for the corona virus, have been also Disinfecting homes and businesses to kill the corona virus and help curb the spread of it.

With suicide cleanup cases, there is typically biohazardous materials everywhere, including human blood, brain matter, and other bodily fluids. When cleaning biohazardous materials it's important to know the health risks associated with exposure to human blood. \n\nHuman blood can carry deadly diseases like HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B, and Hepatitis C.<ref>{{cite web |title=Blood Borne Infectious Diseases: HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C |url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/bbp/default.html |website=CDC Center for Disease Control and Prevention |accessdate=5 August 2019}}</ref> When cleaning up blood it's important to treat every blood spill as if the substance is infected. By using these precautions it will provide an extra layer of safety.\n\n==Business==\n\nCrime scene cleanup began primarily as a local or regional [[small business]] activity but maturity and consolidation has created some larger entities in the industry; only a few nationwide companies exist, although some national [[carpet cleaning]] and [[Building restoration|restoration]] companies franchises have added crime scene cleanup and biohazard removal to their services. Due to the legal and ethical complications, crime scene cleanup is often its own business entity or a separate division. Crime scene clean up businesses are usually started by firefighters or paramedics[http://www.crimesceneintervention.com 1].\n\n==Regulatory requirements==\nWhile the field of crime scene cleanup is not specifically regulated as a class, most if not all of the activities performed by biohazard cleanup teams in the United States are regulated or fall under best practice guidelines from governing and advisory bodies such as [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]], [[NIOSH]], [[Department of Transportation|DOT]], and [[EPA]]. Those who hire a crime scene cleanup company should make sure that they are properly trained in applicable federal and state regulations and can provide documentation of proper biohazardous waste disposal from licensed [[medical waste]] transportation and disposal companies. If in California or Florida the client should confirm that the company is registered with the state Department of Health. A few states such as California, New York and Florida are the only states that explicitly require registration or licensing for crime scene cleanup. Other states may require biohazardous waste transport permits from the DOT.\n\nIn the US, OSHA requires that exposure to blood-borne pathogens be limited as much as possible due to the assumption that the blood and biological material is infectious. Most actions taken to limit exposure fall under cross-contamination protocols, which provide that certain actions be taken to avoid further spreading the contamination throughout otherwise clean areas. CTS De-con companies should have in place, an exposure control plan before beginning work on any trauma scene. Under employee safety and cross-contamination protocols, [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]]'s bloodborne pathogens regulations pertain to bioremediation.\n\nIn the UK, biohazards are regulated in part by HSE.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hse.gov.uk/biosafety/|title=Biosafety and microbiological containment|work=hse.gov.uk}}</ref>\nCanada has published Canadian Biosafety Standards and Guidelines.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://canadianbiosafetystandards.collaboration.gc.ca/|title=Canadian Biosafety Standards and Guidelines|work=collaboration.gc.ca}}</ref>\n\n==Methods==\nThe [[crime]] scene cleaners' work begins when the [[coroner]]'s office or other official, government body releases the \"scene\" to the owner or other responsible parties. Only when the investigation has completely terminated on the [[contaminated]] scene may the [[cleaner|cleaning]] companies begin their task.\n\n[[Standard operating procedures]] for the crime scene cleanup field often include military-like methods for the decontamination of internal and external environments. [[Universal precautions]] recognized worldwide are the cautionary rule-of-thumb for this field of professional cleaning. For example, the personnel involved in the cleanup are expected to wear shoe covers, liquid impermeable coveralls, and protective eyewear.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A Practical Guide for the Law Enforcement and Security Manager: A Theoretical and Experiential Approach|last=Smith|first=Jim|publisher=Charles Thomas Publishers|year=2004|isbn=0398074623|location=Springfield|pages=119}}</ref> Wearing protective gloves and the use of specifically rated cleaning agents are also mandatory policies to ensure that the infectious agents such as [[hepatitis]] and [[HIV]] are killed.<ref>Smith, p. 119.</ref> There are organizations who stress the avoidance of cleaning areas that officers cannot properly see to avoid accidental wounds such as needle puncture.\n\nCleaning methods for removing and sanitizing biohazards vary from practitioner to practitioner. Some organizations are working to create a \"Standard of Clean\" such as ISSA's K12 Standard, which includes use of quantifiable testing methods such as [[ATP test]]ing.\n\n==Organizations==\nThe first specialty trade organization for this field of cleaning was the ''American BioRecovery Association'' (ABRA).{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} The largest association dedicated to the crime scene cleanup industry is the [[National Crime Scene Cleanup Association]] (NCSCA).

It is also referred to as '''[[biohazard]] remediation''', and '''forensic cleanup''', because crime scenes are only a portion of the situations in which biohazard cleaning is needed. Incidents which may require this type of cleanup include accidents, [[suicide]] (or attempted suicide), [[homicide]]s, and [[decomposition]] after unattended death, as well as mass trauma, [[industrial accident]]s, infectious disease contamination, animal biohazard contamination (e.g. [[feces]] or blood) or [[Hazardous waste|regulated waste]] transport, treatment, and disposal.\n\n==Usage==\nTelevision productions like ''[[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation]]'' have added to the popularity of the term \"crime scene cleanup\".

With suicide cleanup cases, there is typically biohazardous materials everywhere, including human blood, brain matter, and other bodily fluids. When cleaning biohazardous materials it's important to know the health risks associated with exposure to human blood. \n\nHuman blood can carry deadly diseases like HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B, and Hepatitis C.<ref>{{cite web |title=Blood Borne Infectious Diseases: HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C |url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/bbp/default.html |website=CDC Center for Disease Control and Prevention |accessdate=5 August 2019}}</ref> When cleaning up blood it's important to treat every blood spill as if the substance is infected. By using these precautions it will provide an extra layer of safety.\n\n==Business==\n\nCrime scene cleanup began primarily as a local or regional [[small business]] activity but maturity and consolidation has created some larger entities in the industry; only a few nationwide companies exist, although some national [[carpet cleaning]] and [[Building restoration|restoration]] companies franchises have added crime scene cleanup and biohazard removal to their services. Due to the legal and ethical complications, crime scene cleanup is often its own business entity or a separate division. Crime scene clean up businesses are usually started by firefighters or paramedics[http://www.crimesceneintervention.com 1].\n\n==Regulatory requirements==\nWhile the field of crime scene cleanup is not specifically regulated as a class, most if not all of the activities performed by biohazard cleanup teams in the United States are regulated or fall under best practice guidelines from governing and advisory bodies such as [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]], [[NIOSH]], [[Department of Transportation|DOT]], and [[EPA]]. Those who hire a crime scene cleanup company should make sure that they are properly trained in applicable federal and state regulations and can provide documentation of proper biohazardous waste disposal from licensed [[medical waste]] transportation and disposal companies. If in California or Florida the client should confirm that the company is registered with the state Department of Health. A few states such as California, New York and Florida are the only states that explicitly require registration or licensing for crime scene cleanup. Other states may require biohazardous waste transport permits from the DOT.\n\nIn the US, OSHA requires that exposure to blood-borne pathogens be limited as much as possible due to the assumption that the blood and biological material is infectious. Most actions taken to limit exposure fall under cross-contamination protocols, which provide that certain actions be taken to avoid further spreading the contamination throughout otherwise clean areas. CTS De-con companies should have in place, an exposure control plan before beginning work on any trauma scene. Under employee safety and cross-contamination protocols, [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]]'s bloodborne pathogens regulations pertain to bioremediation.\n\nIn the UK, biohazards are regulated in part by HSE.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hse.gov.uk/biosafety/|title=Biosafety and microbiological containment|work=hse.gov.uk}}</ref>\nCanada has published Canadian Biosafety Standards and Guidelines.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://canadianbiosafetystandards.collaboration.gc.ca/|title=Canadian Biosafety Standards and Guidelines|work=collaboration.gc.ca}}</ref>\n\n==Methods==\nThe [[crime]] scene cleaners' work begins when the [[coroner]]'s office or other official, government body releases the \"scene\" to the owner or other responsible parties. Only when the investigation has completely terminated on the [[contaminated]] scene may the [[cleaner|cleaning]] companies begin their task.\n\n[[Standard operating procedures]] for the crime scene cleanup field often include military-like methods for the decontamination of internal and external environments. [[Universal precautions]] recognized worldwide are the cautionary rule-of-thumb for this field of professional cleaning. For example, the personnel involved in the cleanup are expected to wear shoe covers, liquid impermeable coveralls, and protective eyewear.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A Practical Guide for the Law Enforcement and Security Manager: A Theoretical and Experiential Approach|last=Smith|first=Jim|publisher=Charles Thomas Publishers|year=2004|isbn=0398074623|location=Springfield|pages=119}}</ref> Wearing protective gloves and the use of specifically rated cleaning agents are also mandatory policies to ensure that the infectious agents such as [[hepatitis]] and [[HIV]] are killed.<ref>Smith, p. 119.</ref> There are organizations who stress the avoidance of cleaning areas that officers cannot properly see to avoid accidental wounds such as needle puncture.\n\nCleaning methods for removing and sanitizing biohazards vary from practitioner to practitioner. Some organizations are working to create a \"Standard of Clean\" such as ISSA's K12 Standard, which includes use of quantifiable testing methods such as [[ATP test]]ing.\n\n==Organizations==\nThe first specialty trade organization for this field of cleaning was the ''American BioRecovery Association'' (ABRA).{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} The largest association dedicated to the crime scene cleanup industry is the [[National Crime Scene Cleanup Association]] (NCSCA).

Coyote was also an actor, writer and director with the [[San Francisco Mime Troupe]]; his prominence in the San Francisco [[counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]] scene led to his being interviewed for the book ''Voices from the Love Generation''. He acted in and directed the first cross-country tour of ''The Minstrel Show'', and his play ''Olive Pits'', co-authored with Mime Troupe member [[Peter Berg (bioregionalist)|Peter Berg]], won the troupe an [[Obie Award]] from ''[[The Village Voice]]''.

Kennedy]]'s \"peace race\". Kennedy invited the group into the [[White House]], the first time protesters had ever been so recognized, and they met for several hours with [[McGeorge Bundy]].

A few years later, he came across ''Coyote's Journal'', a poetry magazine, and recognized its logo as the same paw-prints he had seen during his drug-induced experience. This caused him to change his name to Coyote, after meeting [[Rolling Thunder (person)|Rolling Thunder]] (John Pope), a self-styled [[Shamanism|shaman]], who believed the experience was spiritually significant.<ref>\"Krassner reviews 'Sleeping Where I Fall' by Peter Coyote\" (Sep/Oct 1999) ''[[Tikkun (magazine)|Tikkun]]'' Vol.14 No.5 pp. 71-74</ref>\n\n==Countercultural activities==\nAfter a short apprenticeship at the San Francisco [[Actor's Workshop]], he joined the [[San Francisco Mime Troupe]], a radical political street theater whose members were arrested for performing in parks without permits. Coyote acted, wrote scripts, and directed in the Mime Troupe. Coyote directed the first cross-country tour of ''The Minstrel Show, Civil Rights in a Cracker Barrel.\n\nFrom 1967 to 1975, Coyote was a prominent member of the San Francisco Haight-Ashbury [[counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]] community and a founding member, along with [[Emmett Grogan]], Peter Berg, Judy Goldhaft, Kent Minault, Nina Blasenheim, David Simpson, Jane Lapiner, and Billy Murcott, of the [[Diggers (theater)|Diggers]], an anarchist group known for operating anonymously and without money.<ref name=\"diggers\">{{cite web|url=http://www.diggers.org/overview.htm |title=Overview: who were (are) the Diggers? |publisher=Diggers.org |date= |accessdate=2016-03-14}}</ref> They created provocative \"theater\" events designed to heighten awareness of problems associated with the notion of private property, consumerism, and identification with one's work. They fed nearly 600 people a day for \"free\", asking only that people pass through a six-foot by six-foot square known as The Free Frame of Reference. They ran a Free Store, (where not only the goods, but the management roles were free), a Free Medical Clinic, and even a short-lived Free Bank.<ref name=\"diggers\"/> The Diggers evolved into a group known as the Free Family, which established chains of communes around the [[Pacific Northwest]] and [[Southwestern United States|Southwest]]. Coyote was the best known resident of the [[Black Bear Ranch]] commune in [[Siskiyou County, California]].\n\nHe was a friend of [[Rolling Thunder (person)|Rolling Thunder]], a purported Shoshone Medicine man. He has also been a friend of [[Leonard Peltier]], a Native American activist and member of the [[American Indian Movement]] (AIM) since the 1960s and, along with author [[Peter Mathiessen]], is one of Peltier's two non-native advisers.\n\nOf this period of his life, Coyote wrote the book in ''Sleeping Where I Fall.''\n\n==Discovering Zen==\nCoyote had first discovered [[Zen]] in his teens via the works of [[Jack Kerouac]], [[Gary Snyder]], and other [[Beat Generation|Beats]]. Coyote met Snyder with the Diggers and was impressed with Snyder's \"gravitas and elegance, his care and deliberation\".\n\nBeginning in 1975, Coyote undertook meditation practice and eventually became a dedicated practitioner of American Zen Buddhism, moving into the [[San Francisco Zen Center]].<ref name=\"sweep\"/><ref name=\"zenbones\">{{cite web|url=http://www.petercoyote.com/zenflesh.html |title=Zen Flesh, Zen Bones |publisher=Petercoyote.com |date= |accessdate=2016-03-14}}</ref> He was later ordained a lay priest in the [[S\u014dt\u014d]] tradition and was ordained as a Zen Priest in 2015.\n\nCoyote performed [[audiobook]] recordings of [[Shunryu Suzuki]]'s ''[[Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind]]'', [[Paul Reps]]'s ''[[Zen Flesh, Zen Bones]]'' as well as narrating the documentary ''Inquiry into the Great Matter: A History of Zen Buddhism''.\n\n== San Francisco Arts Commission and the California Arts Council ==\nIn keeping with his dedication to community-based art, Peter Coyote was employed in the early 1970s by the [[San Francisco Arts Commission]] in the historical Neighborhood Arts Program (NAP), with funding from the [[Comprehensive Employment and Training Act]] (CETA, Pub.L. 93\u2013203), a United States federal law enacted by Congress, signed into law by President Richard Nixon in 1973, to train workers and provide them with jobs in the public service.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/R?d095:FLD001:@4(Manpower+training+programs) |title=Manpower training programs, The Library of Congress |publisher=Thomas.loc.gov |date= |accessdate=2016-03-14}}</ref> The San Francisco Arts Commission's Neighborhood Arts/CETA Program was the first in the country to use CETA funds to hire artists to work in service to a city.<ref>{{YouTube|O8awBsmvtnc}}</ref> From this position, Coyote was appointed by [[Jerry Brown|Governor Jerry Brown]] to be a member of the [[California Arts Council]], the state agency which determines art policy for the state. He served on the CAC from 1975 to 1983. After his first year, Coyote was elected chairman by his peers three years in a row. During his tenure as chairman, the Council's overhead expenses dropped from 50% to 15%, the lowest in the State, and the Arts Council budget rose from $1 million to $16 million. His council introduced the idea of artists as \"creative problem solvers.\" By paying artists to \"solve problems for the state\" rather than to make art, they bypassed the objections of many conservative lawmakers. Coyote engineered relationships with 14 departments of the State of California, which began to use artists in a variety of capacities, paying 50 cents on the dollar for it. The policy and the council were an immense success, giving Coyote the confidence (after 12 years in the counterculture) to try his hand at mainstream film-acting.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}\n\n==Film and television acting==\nIn 1978, Coyote began acting again (\"to shake the rust out\") appearing in plays at San Francisco's award-winning [[Magic Theatre]]. While playing the lead in the world premiere of [[Sam Shepard]]'s ''[[True West (play)|True West]]'', a Hollywood agent approached him, and his film career began with ''[[Die Laughing (film)|Die Laughing]]'' (1980). He gave supporting performances in ''[[Tell Me a Riddle (film)|Tell Me a Riddle]]'' (1980), ''[[Southern Comfort (1981 film)|Southern Comfort]]'' (1981) and as the mysterious scientist \"Keys\" in ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'' (1982). He was seriously considered for the role of [[Indiana Jones]] in ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'' (1981), and auditioned for the part. Coyote's first starring role was in the science fiction adventure ''[[Timerider: The Adventure of Lyle Swann]]'' (1982). He also starred in ''[[Jagged Edge (film)|Jagged Edge]]'' (1985) and ''[[Outrageous Fortune (film)|Outrageous Fortune]]'' (1987). Since then, he has made more than 120 films for theaters and television and has played starring roles for many directors, including [[Roman Polanski]] (''[[Bitter Moon]]''), [[Pedro Almod\u00f3var]] (''[[Kika (1993 film)|Kika]]''), [[Martin Ritt]] (''[[Cross Creek (film)|Cross Creek]]''), [[Jean-Paul Rappeneau]] (''[[Bon Voyage (2003 film)|Bon Voyage]]''), [[Diane Kurys]] (''[[A Man in Love (1987 film)|A Man in Love]]'') and [[Walter Salles]] (''[[A Grande Arte|Exposure]]''). For his 1990 guest appearance on the television series ''[[Road to Avonlea]]'', he received his first [[Primetime Emmy Award]] nomination.\n\n[[Leonard Maltin]] once wrote, \"Coyote's no rubber-stamp leading man\", but he seems comfortable with that. \"I'm a [[Zen]] Buddhist student first, actor second\", Coyote has said. \"If I can't reconcile the two lives, I'll stop acting. I spend more time off-screen than on.\" In addition to his movie work in more recent films such as ''[[Sphere (1998 film)|Sphere]]'', ''[[A Walk to Remember]]'', and ''[[Erin Brockovich (film)|Erin Brockovich]]'', Coyote has also appeared in many made-for-TV movies and miniseries, and he does commercial voice-overs. Coyote was cast in lead roles on several television series: ''[[The 4400]]'' in 2004 and ''[[The Inside (TV series)|The Inside]]'' in 2005. After ''The Inside'' was canceled, Coyote returned to ''The 4400'' as a special guest star for their two-part season finale, then joined the cast of [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s series ''[[Commander in Chief (TV series)|Commander in Chief]]'' as the [[Vice President of the United States]], and the next year did a four episode turn as [[Sally Field]]'s disreputable boyfriend in ''[[Brothers & Sisters (2006 TV series)|Brothers & Sisters]]''.\n\n==Narration==\nIn 2005, Coyote served as the narrator for several prominent projects including the documentary film ''[[Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room]]'' and the ''[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]]''-produced [[PBS]] documentary based on [[Jared Diamond]]'s ''[[Guns, Germs, and Steel]]''. He also narrated an episode of the series ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'' in April 2006. In 2008, he narrated ''[[Torturing Democracy]]'', a documentary produced by [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] which details the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|George W. Bush administration]]'s use of \"[[enhanced interrogation techniques]]\" in the [[War on Terror]]. He also narrated the 12-hour [[Ken Burns]] series on the [[The National Parks: America's Best Idea|National Parks]], and 15 episodes for the ''[[National Geographic Explorer]]'' series. In 2010 he narrated the documentary ''Solitary Confinement'' on the effect of long-term isolation, with footage taken from [[Colorado State Penitentiary]] where all prisoners are held this way. In 2014, he appeared in the [[TNT (American TV network)|TNT]] television series ''[[Perception (American TV series)|Perception]]'', as the father of the main character, Dr. Daniel Pierce, and narrated Burns' [[The Roosevelts (miniseries)|''The Roosevelts: An Intimate History'']]; the latter saw him win his first [[Primetime Emmy Award]]. In 2019, he narrated Burns' PBS documentary ''[[Country Music (miniseries)]]''.<ref>https://www.pbs.org/kenburns/country-music/</ref>\n\n==Writing==\nCoyote's [[left-wing politics]] are evident in his articles for ''[[Mother Jones magazine|Mother Jones]]'' magazine, some of which he wrote as a delegate to the [[1996 Democratic National Convention]]; in his disagreements with [[David Horowitz (conservative writer)|David Horowitz]]; and in his autobiography ''Sleeping Where I Fall''. In 2006, he developed a political television show for [[Link TV]] called \"The Active Opposition\" and in 2007 created ''Outside the Box with Peter Coyote'' starting on Link TV's special, Special: ''The End of Oil \u2013 Part 2''.\n\nMany of Coyote's stories from the 1967 to 1975 [[counter-culture]] period are included in his memoir, ''Sleeping Where I Fall,'' published by [[Counterpoint Press]] in April 1998. One of the stories incorporated into his book is \"Carla's Story,\" about a 16-year-old mother who lived communally with Coyote, and who, after learning of her husband's murder, became a drug addict, then a prostitute, had her children stolen, and continued to spiral downhill until she turned her life around. This story was published in ''[[Zyzzyva (magazine)|Zyzzyva]]'', and awarded the 1993\u20131994 [[Pushcart Prize]]. He also states he was a close friend of singer [[Janis Joplin]].

He served on the CAC from 1975 to 1983. After his first year, Coyote was elected chairman by his peers three years in a row. During his tenure as chairman, the Council's overhead expenses dropped from 50% to 15%, the lowest in the State, and the Arts Council budget rose from $1 million to $16 million. His council introduced the idea of artists as \"creative problem solvers.\" By paying artists to \"solve problems for the state\" rather than to make art, they bypassed the objections of many conservative lawmakers. Coyote engineered relationships with 14 departments of the State of California, which began to use artists in a variety of capacities, paying 50 cents on the dollar for it. The policy and the council were an immense success, giving Coyote the confidence (after 12 years in the counterculture) to try his hand at mainstream film-acting.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}\n\n==Film and television acting==\nIn 1978, Coyote began acting again (\"to shake the rust out\") appearing in plays at San Francisco's award-winning [[Magic Theatre]]. While playing the lead in the world premiere of [[Sam Shepard]]'s ''[[True West (play)|True West]]'', a Hollywood agent approached him, and his film career began with ''[[Die Laughing (film)|Die Laughing]]'' (1980). He gave supporting performances in ''[[Tell Me a Riddle (film)|Tell Me a Riddle]]'' (1980), ''[[Southern Comfort (1981 film)|Southern Comfort]]'' (1981) and as the mysterious scientist \"Keys\" in ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'' (1982). He was seriously considered for the role of [[Indiana Jones]] in ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'' (1981), and auditioned for the part. Coyote's first starring role was in the science fiction adventure ''[[Timerider: The Adventure of Lyle Swann]]'' (1982). He also starred in ''[[Jagged Edge (film)|Jagged Edge]]'' (1985) and ''[[Outrageous Fortune (film)|Outrageous Fortune]]'' (1987). Since then, he has made more than 120 films for theaters and television and has played starring roles for many directors, including [[Roman Polanski]] (''[[Bitter Moon]]''), [[Pedro Almod\u00f3var]] (''[[Kika (1993 film)|Kika]]''), [[Martin Ritt]] (''[[Cross Creek (film)|Cross Creek]]''), [[Jean-Paul Rappeneau]] (''[[Bon Voyage (2003 film)|Bon Voyage]]''), [[Diane Kurys]] (''[[A Man in Love (1987 film)|A Man in Love]]'') and [[Walter Salles]] (''[[A Grande Arte|Exposure]]''). For his 1990 guest appearance on the television series ''[[Road to Avonlea]]'', he received his first [[Primetime Emmy Award]] nomination.\n\n[[Leonard Maltin]] once wrote, \"Coyote's no rubber-stamp leading man\", but he seems comfortable with that. \"I'm a [[Zen]] Buddhist student first, actor second\", Coyote has said. \"If I can't reconcile the two lives, I'll stop acting. I spend more time off-screen than on.\" In addition to his movie work in more recent films such as ''[[Sphere (1998 film)|Sphere]]'', ''[[A Walk to Remember]]'', and ''[[Erin Brockovich (film)|Erin Brockovich]]'', Coyote has also appeared in many made-for-TV movies and miniseries, and he does commercial voice-overs. Coyote was cast in lead roles on several television series: ''[[The 4400]]'' in 2004 and ''[[The Inside (TV series)|The Inside]]'' in 2005. After ''The Inside'' was canceled, Coyote returned to ''The 4400'' as a special guest star for their two-part season finale, then joined the cast of [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s series ''[[Commander in Chief (TV series)|Commander in Chief]]'' as the [[Vice President of the United States]], and the next year did a four episode turn as [[Sally Field]]'s disreputable boyfriend in ''[[Brothers & Sisters (2006 TV series)|Brothers & Sisters]]''.\n\n==Narration==\nIn 2005, Coyote served as the narrator for several prominent projects including the documentary film ''[[Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room]]'' and the ''[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]]''-produced [[PBS]] documentary based on [[Jared Diamond]]'s ''[[Guns, Germs, and Steel]]''. He also narrated an episode of the series ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'' in April 2006. In 2008, he narrated ''[[Torturing Democracy]]'', a documentary produced by [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] which details the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|George W. Bush administration]]'s use of \"[[enhanced interrogation techniques]]\" in the [[War on Terror]]. He also narrated the 12-hour [[Ken Burns]] series on the [[The National Parks: America's Best Idea|National Parks]], and 15 episodes for the ''[[National Geographic Explorer]]'' series. In 2010 he narrated the documentary ''Solitary Confinement'' on the effect of long-term isolation, with footage taken from [[Colorado State Penitentiary]] where all prisoners are held this way. In 2014, he appeared in the [[TNT (American TV network)|TNT]] television series ''[[Perception (American TV series)|Perception]]'', as the father of the main character, Dr. Daniel Pierce, and narrated Burns' [[The Roosevelts (miniseries)|''The Roosevelts: An Intimate History'']]; the latter saw him win his first [[Primetime Emmy Award]]. In 2019, he narrated Burns' PBS documentary ''[[Country Music (miniseries)]]''.<ref>https://www.pbs.org/kenburns/country-music/</ref>\n\n==Writing==\nCoyote's [[left-wing politics]] are evident in his articles for ''[[Mother Jones magazine|Mother Jones]]'' magazine, some of which he wrote as a delegate to the [[1996 Democratic National Convention]]; in his disagreements with [[David Horowitz (conservative writer)|David Horowitz]]; and in his autobiography ''Sleeping Where I Fall''. In 2006, he developed a political television show for [[Link TV]] called \"The Active Opposition\" and in 2007 created ''Outside the Box with Peter Coyote'' starting on Link TV's special, Special: ''The End of Oil \u2013 Part 2''.\n\nMany of Coyote's stories from the 1967 to 1975 [[counter-culture]] period are included in his memoir, ''Sleeping Where I Fall,'' published by [[Counterpoint Press]] in April 1998. One of the stories incorporated into his book is \"Carla's Story,\" about a 16-year-old mother who lived communally with Coyote, and who, after learning of her husband's murder, became a drug addict, then a prostitute, had her children stolen, and continued to spiral downhill until she turned her life around. This story was published in ''[[Zyzzyva (magazine)|Zyzzyva]]'', and awarded the 1993\u20131994 [[Pushcart Prize]]. He also states he was a close friend of singer [[Janis Joplin]].
