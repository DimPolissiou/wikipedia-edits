Since then more than 4 million batteries have been recycled through that program and the mobile battery service.

Using several different types of tests, AAA recreated real-world driving conditions to illustrate the difference in fuel economy, and the EPA incorporated AAA\u2019s testing into their new procedures. The more accurate testing resulted in a reduction of miles per gallon claims between 5 and 25 percent, beginning with 2008 model year vehicles.<ref>{{cite web |title=New EPA Fuel Economy Ratings |url=http://www.gassavers.org/showthread.php?t=2209 |publisher=GasSavers.org |date=November 17, 2006 |accessdate=September 29, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726074031/http://www.gassavers.org/showthread.php?t=2209 |archive-date=July 26, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nAs fuel prices rise, consumers often see increased marketing of fuel additives as a way to boost fuel economy. AAA has tested many of these products and has never found one that provides significant savings for consumers. AAA has warned consumers repeatedly against products that make such claims and encourages motorists to develop instead fuel-conserving driving habits, such as reducing the weight of the vehicle by removing unnecessary objects from the trunk, instituting smooth stops and starts, and reducing their speed.<ref>{{cite web |title=AAA: Steer Clear of \"Fuel-Saving\" Additives |url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2006/05/aaa_steer_clear.html |publisher=Green Car Congress |date=May 26, 2006 |accessdate=September 29, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101021082115/http://www.greencarcongress.com/2006/05/aaa_steer_clear.html| archivedate= October 21, 2010 | url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIt is generally understood that the benefits of fuel conservation for consumers include financial savings, improved road safety and a healthier environment. To assist motorists in becoming more conscious about saving fuel, AAA published its first Gas Watcher\u2019s Guide in the 1970s during the oil crisis. The annual guide provides information on a variety of factors that affect fuel economy, such as modifying driving behavior, keeping a vehicle well maintained, choosing the proper fuel, and choosing the most fuel-efficient vehicle for a family\u2019s needs.<ref>{{cite web |title=AAA 2010 Gas Watcher's Guide |url=https://midatlantic.aaa.com/-/media/Files/PGA/Gas/GasWatchersGuide2010d-(2).ashx |date=March 12, 2010 |accessdate=March 4, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180304231541/https://midatlantic.aaa.com/-/media/Files/PGA/Gas/GasWatchersGuide2010d-(2).ashx |archive-date=March 4, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nOver the years, AAA has encouraged consumers to use public transportation by including these transportation options in its travel guidebooks. AAA has also called on government to invest adequately in a multi-modal transportation system that is widely accessible and affordable. In comments to the National Journal, AAA President and CEO Robert L. Darbelnet said that funding for high-speed rail from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act is a \u201cdrop in the bucket\u201d of what is needed, and that those funds would be well spent if, going forward, additional sources of investment could be identified.<ref>{{cite news |first=Lisa |last=Caruso |title=Is Obama Spending The High-Speed Rail Money Wisely? |url=http://transportation.nationaljournal.com/2010/02/is-obama-spending-the-highspee.php |publisher=National Journal&nbsp;\u2013 Expert Blogs: Transportation |date=February 1, 2010 |accessdate=September 29, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100818235541/http://transportation.nationaljournal.com/2010/02/is-obama-spending-the-highspee.php| archivedate= August 18, 2010 | url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to encouraging fuel efficiency and conservation, AAA and other organizations initiated National Car Care Month during the 1980s to publicize the fact that poorly maintained vehicles contribute to excessive energy consumption and air pollution.

With support from agencies such as the National Park Service, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Environmental Protection Agency and others, AAA produced travel tips and public service messages encouraging travelers to help protect America's scenic areas and respect the environment. Topics included reducing congestion and pollution, conserving energy, disposing of litter and enjoying wildlife at a distance. The prevailing theme was that heavy use or abuse of a site damages the quality of the experience for everyone and sometimes even results in the closure of parks and recreation areas. The message was simple but effective.<ref>{{cite news |first=Steve |last=Carlic |title=Ecotourism focuses on appreciating nature |url=http://blog.syracuse.com/green/2009/01/ecotourism_focuses_on_apprecia.html |newspaper=The Post-Standard |date=January 26, 2009 |accessdate=October 6, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401195404/http://blog.syracuse.com/green/2009/01/ecotourism_focuses_on_apprecia.html |archive-date=April 1, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Greener Driving |url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1992-06-29/business/9206270816_1_greener-driving-conserving-fuel-environmental-tips |newspaper=Orlando Sentinel |date=June 29, 1992 |accessdate=October 6, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120829174712/http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1992-06-29/business/9206270816_1_greener-driving-conserving-fuel-environmental-tips |archive-date=August 29, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Green Travel on Vacation&nbsp;\u2013 with Style |url=http://www.travelsense.org/tips/greentravel.cfm |publisher=Travel Sense |accessdate=October 6, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101005060444/http://www.travelsense.org/tips/greentravel.cfm |archivedate=October 5, 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn 2016, AAA introduced a [http://exchangeev.aaa.com/ new website] focused on [[Hybrid electric vehicle|hybrid]] and [[electric vehicle]]s, and offers mobile charging aid for stranded EVs, similar to fuel-starved piston cars.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://electrek.co/2016/09/06/aaa-ev-emergency-charging-truck/|title=AAA says that its emergency electric vehicle charging trucks served \"thousands\" of EVs without power|work=Electrek|accessdate=September 6, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160910081813/https://electrek.co/2016/09/06/aaa-ev-emergency-charging-truck/|archive-date=September 10, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAAA clubs have also been a part of the organization\u2019s century-long environmental advocacy efforts including:\n* In 1919, alarmed by rapid destruction of California\u2019s giant [[redwood tree]]s at the hands of commercial loggers, AAA's California State Automobile Association launched a multiyear publicity and lobbying campaign.

AAA said that more research needed to be done on the potential harmful effects prior to increasing the ethanol content in fuel.<ref>{{cite web |title=AAA Calls for the EPA to Reject Petition to Increase Ethanol Content in Gasoline to 15 Percent |url=http://www.theautochannel.com/news/2009/07/22/470887.html |publisher=TheAutoChannel.com |date=July 22, 2009 |accessdate=October 8, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101220224047/http://theautochannel.com/news/2009/07/22/470887.html |archive-date=December 20, 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIn another instance, AAA supported the overall goal of the Clean Air Act, but objected to several specific provisions in the legislation, requesting clarification of the proposed state inspection and maintenance program provision and asking that the implementation guidelines be fully evaluated prior to enactment. According to a Washington Times article,{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}} which referred to research by Energy & Environment Analysis Inc., tightening federal emissions standards had led to a role reversal for the automobile, making it less of a contributor to smog. Instead, stationary emission sources such as factories, as well as heavy and utility vehicles were more of a threat to air quality and would be appropriate targets in the battle against smog. \u201cHowever, by primarily emphasizing vehicle regulations in the 1970s and ignoring gasoline regulations EPA actually caused fuels to become dirtier, effectively undermining a significant portion of any gains achieved through the tighter control of vehicles.\u201d <ref>{{cite web |first=Michael |last=Gough |title=Clearing the Air on EPA's New Emissions Proposal |url=http://cei.org/studies-point/clearing-air-epa%E2%80%99s-new-emissions-proposal |publisher=[[Competitive Enterprise Institute]] |date=May 10, 1999 |accessdate=October 8, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003190049/http://cei.org/studies-point/clearing-air-epa%E2%80%99s-new-emissions-proposal |archive-date=October 3, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Matthew L. |last=Wald |title=Gasoline Prices to Rise in Many Areas |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/09/us/gasoline-prices-to-rise-in-many-areas.html?scp=1&sq=%22clean-air%20rules%22%20AND%20%22American%20Automobile%20Association%22&st=cse |work=The New York Times |date=November 9, 1994 |accessdate=October 8, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150725132124/http://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/09/us/gasoline-prices-to-rise-in-many-areas.html?scp=1&sq=%22clean-air%20rules%22%20AND%20%22American%20Automobile%20Association%22&st=cse |archive-date=July 25, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |first=Eric |last=Peters |title=A Catalytic Con Job |publisher=Investor's Business Daily |date=December 16, 1998 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |first=Michael |last=Koontz |title=Clean Air and Transportation: The Facts may Surprise You |url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/publications/publicroads/98julaug/clean.cfm |publisher=[[Federal Highway Administration]] |date=July\u2013August 1998 |accessdate=October 8, 2010 |journal= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111021143543/http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/publications/publicroads/98julaug/clean.cfm |archive-date=October 21, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nAnd more recently, although AAA supports the manufacture and use of hybrid vehicles, research by the British Columbia Automobile Association in 2010 shows that they do not result in significant financial savings for consumers, although they are often marketed that way.<ref>{{cite news|title=Hybrid gas savings no deal says report |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/hybrid-gas-savings-no-deal-says-report-1.869323 |publisher=CBC News |date=July 22, 2010 |accessdate=October 8, 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100724230928/http://www.cbc.ca/consumer/story/2010/07/22/con-hybrid-costs.html |archivedate=July 24, 2010 }}</ref>\n\nIn response to these concerns, several competing organizations have emerged, including [[Better World Club]].

Using several different types of tests, AAA recreated real-world driving conditions to illustrate the difference in fuel economy, and the EPA incorporated AAA\u2019s testing into their new procedures. The more accurate testing resulted in a reduction of miles per gallon claims between 5 and 25 percent, beginning with 2008 model year vehicles.<ref>{{cite web |title=New EPA Fuel Economy Ratings |url=http://www.gassavers.org/showthread.php?t=2209 |publisher=GasSavers.org |date=November 17, 2006 |accessdate=September 29, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726074031/http://www.gassavers.org/showthread.php?t=2209 |archive-date=July 26, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nAs fuel prices rise, consumers often see increased marketing of fuel additives as a way to boost fuel economy. AAA has tested many of these products and has never found one that provides significant savings for consumers. AAA has warned consumers repeatedly against products that make such claims and encourages motorists to develop instead fuel-conserving driving habits, such as reducing the weight of the vehicle by removing unnecessary objects from the trunk, instituting smooth stops and starts, and reducing their speed.<ref>{{cite web |title=AAA: Steer Clear of \"Fuel-Saving\" Additives |url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2006/05/aaa_steer_clear.html |publisher=Green Car Congress |date=May 26, 2006 |accessdate=September 29, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101021082115/http://www.greencarcongress.com/2006/05/aaa_steer_clear.html| archivedate= October 21, 2010 | url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIt is generally understood that the benefits of fuel conservation for consumers include financial savings, improved road safety and a healthier environment. To assist motorists in becoming more conscious about saving fuel, AAA published its first Gas Watcher\u2019s Guide in the 1970s during the oil crisis. The annual guide provides information on a variety of factors that affect fuel economy, such as modifying driving behavior, keeping a vehicle well maintained, choosing the proper fuel, and choosing the most fuel-efficient vehicle for a family\u2019s needs.<ref>{{cite web |title=AAA 2010 Gas Watcher's Guide |url=https://midatlantic.aaa.com/-/media/Files/PGA/Gas/GasWatchersGuide2010d-(2).ashx |date=March 12, 2010 |accessdate=March 4, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180304231541/https://midatlantic.aaa.com/-/media/Files/PGA/Gas/GasWatchersGuide2010d-(2).ashx |archive-date=March 4, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nOver the years, AAA has encouraged consumers to use public transportation by including these transportation options in its travel guidebooks. AAA has also called on government to invest adequately in a multi-modal transportation system that is widely accessible and affordable. In comments to the National Journal, AAA President and CEO Robert L. Darbelnet said that funding for high-speed rail from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act is a \u201cdrop in the bucket\u201d of what is needed, and that those funds would be well spent if, going forward, additional sources of investment could be identified.<ref>{{cite news |first=Lisa |last=Caruso |title=Is Obama Spending The High-Speed Rail Money Wisely? |url=http://transportation.nationaljournal.com/2010/02/is-obama-spending-the-highspee.php |publisher=National Journal&nbsp;\u2013 Expert Blogs: Transportation |date=February 1, 2010 |accessdate=September 29, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100818235541/http://transportation.nationaljournal.com/2010/02/is-obama-spending-the-highspee.php| archivedate= August 18, 2010 | url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to encouraging fuel efficiency and conservation, AAA and other organizations initiated National Car Care Month during the 1980s to publicize the fact that poorly maintained vehicles contribute to excessive energy consumption and air pollution.

With support from agencies such as the National Park Service, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Environmental Protection Agency and others, AAA produced travel tips and public service messages encouraging travelers to help protect America's scenic areas and respect the environment. Topics included reducing congestion and pollution, conserving energy, disposing of litter and enjoying wildlife at a distance. The prevailing theme was that heavy use or abuse of a site damages the quality of the experience for everyone and sometimes even results in the closure of parks and recreation areas.

For instance, in 2009, AAA asked the EPA not to increase the allowable ethanol content in gasoline from 10 percent to 15 percent, citing several concerns affecting vehicle emissions, engine performance, system component damage, and vehicle warranty agreements, among others. AAA said that more research needed to be done on the potential harmful effects prior to increasing the ethanol content in fuel.<ref>{{cite web |title=AAA Calls for the EPA to Reject Petition to Increase Ethanol Content in Gasoline to 15 Percent |url=http://www.theautochannel.com/news/2009/07/22/470887.html |publisher=TheAutoChannel.com |date=July 22, 2009 |accessdate=October 8, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101220224047/http://theautochannel.com/news/2009/07/22/470887.html |archive-date=December 20, 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIn another instance, AAA supported the overall goal of the Clean Air Act, but objected to several specific provisions in the legislation, requesting clarification of the proposed state inspection and maintenance program provision and asking that the implementation guidelines be fully evaluated prior to enactment. According to a Washington Times article,{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}} which referred to research by Energy & Environment Analysis Inc., tightening federal emissions standards had led to a role reversal for the automobile, making it less of a contributor to smog. Instead, stationary emission sources such as factories, as well as heavy and utility vehicles were more of a threat to air quality and would be appropriate targets in the battle against smog. \u201cHowever, by primarily emphasizing vehicle regulations in the 1970s and ignoring gasoline regulations EPA actually caused fuels to become dirtier, effectively undermining a significant portion of any gains achieved through the tighter control of vehicles.\u201d <ref>{{cite web |first=Michael |last=Gough |title=Clearing the Air on EPA's New Emissions Proposal |url=http://cei.org/studies-point/clearing-air-epa%E2%80%99s-new-emissions-proposal |publisher=[[Competitive Enterprise Institute]] |date=May 10, 1999 |accessdate=October 8, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003190049/http://cei.org/studies-point/clearing-air-epa%E2%80%99s-new-emissions-proposal |archive-date=October 3, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Matthew L. |last=Wald |title=Gasoline Prices to Rise in Many Areas |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/09/us/gasoline-prices-to-rise-in-many-areas.html?scp=1&sq=%22clean-air%20rules%22%20AND%20%22American%20Automobile%20Association%22&st=cse |work=The New York Times |date=November 9, 1994 |accessdate=October 8, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150725132124/http://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/09/us/gasoline-prices-to-rise-in-many-areas.html?scp=1&sq=%22clean-air%20rules%22%20AND%20%22American%20Automobile%20Association%22&st=cse |archive-date=July 25, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |first=Eric |last=Peters |title=A Catalytic Con Job |publisher=Investor's Business Daily |date=December 16, 1998 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |first=Michael |last=Koontz |title=Clean Air and Transportation: The Facts may Surprise You |url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/publications/publicroads/98julaug/clean.cfm |publisher=[[Federal Highway Administration]] |date=July\u2013August 1998 |accessdate=October 8, 2010 |journal= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111021143543/http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/publications/publicroads/98julaug/clean.cfm |archive-date=October 21, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nAnd more recently, although AAA supports the manufacture and use of hybrid vehicles, research by the British Columbia Automobile Association in 2010 shows that they do not result in significant financial savings for consumers, although they are often marketed that way.<ref>{{cite news|title=Hybrid gas savings no deal says report |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/hybrid-gas-savings-no-deal-says-report-1.869323 |publisher=CBC News |date=July 22, 2010 |accessdate=October 8, 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100724230928/http://www.cbc.ca/consumer/story/2010/07/22/con-hybrid-costs.html |archivedate=July 24, 2010 }}</ref>\n\nIn response to these concerns, several competing organizations have emerged, including [[Better World Club]].

The match ended via a disqualification win for Owens, as Rollins attacked him with the ring bell. Owens then taunted Rollins to face him again in a [[no disqualification match]], which was accepted.

A hearse arrived at the cemetery to The Undertaker's theme music, however, Styles emerged from the casket. The Undertaker then arrived riding a motorcycle (reminiscent of his [[The Undertaker#American Bad Ass (2000\u20132001)|\"American Bad Ass\" gimmick]]) to the tune of [[Metallica]]'s \"[[Now That We're Dead]]\". Halfway through the match, Styles' O.C. teammates Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson appeared in an attempt to assist Styles, but The Undertaker fought them off. The Undertaker then fought a group of druids before Styles gained the upper hand again. Styles attacked Undertaker with a spade which caused Undertaker to fall in the grave. As Styles was preparing to drop dirt on Undertaker to bury him and win, Undertaker appeared behind Styles and started to attack him. Undertaker and Styles fought all over the graveyard and atop the warehouse rooftop. Undertaker then fought Gallows and Anderson on the rooftop.

The match ended via a disqualification win for Owens, as Rollins attacked him with the ring bell. Owens then taunted Rollins to face him again in a [[no disqualification match]], which was accepted.

A hearse arrived at the cemetery to The Undertaker's theme music, however, Styles emerged from the casket. The Undertaker then arrived riding a motorcycle (reminiscent of his [[The Undertaker#American Bad Ass (2000\u20132001)|\"American Bad Ass\" gimmick]]) to the tune of [[Metallica]]'s \"[[Now That We're Dead]]\". Halfway through the match, Styles' O.C. teammates Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson appeared in an attempt to assist Styles, but The Undertaker fought them off. The Undertaker then fought a group of druids before Styles gained the upper hand again. Styles attacked Undertaker with a spade which caused Undertaker to fall in the grave. As Styles was preparing to drop dirt on Undertaker to bury him and win, Undertaker appeared behind Styles and started to attack him. Undertaker and Styles fought all over the graveyard and atop the warehouse rooftop. Undertaker then fought Gallows and Anderson on the rooftop.
