The VI also has its own 25-metre [[swimming pool]] and synthetic track for [[100 metres]] sprint events, making it the only school in the region with these facilities at that time.\n\n== Student life ==\nIt is a rule that all freshman students are required to join at least one uniform body, take on an active role in one of the school's 50 clubs and to participate in a least one sport.\n\n== Rivalry ==\nThe VI has its rivals, both in Kuala Lumpur and nationally. [[St. John's Institution, Kuala Lumpur|St. John's Institution]] and [[Methodist Boys' School (Kuala Lumpur)|MBSSKL]] are the VI's traditional regional archrivals for the past 101 years. This rivalry can be observed during sports tournaments between these three schools. Nationally, the VI also enjoys a rivalry with two elite institutions\u2014the [[Royal Military College, Kuala Lumpur]] and the [[Malay College Kuala Kangsar]]. The rivalry with the former is apparent in football and rugby MSSKL state level tournaments and the rivalry with the latter is evident in the Sultan Azlan Shah Cup, a football playoff between the premier schools of [[Kuala Lumpur]] and [[Kuala Kangsar]], [[Perak]].\n\n=== Traditions and heritage ===\nThe prefect disciplinary system is very much similar to the traditions first laid out by the school's second headmaster, Major Richard Sidney ([http://www.viweb.mysite.com/FirstPref.htm VI First Prefects]).\n\nDetention classes and community service are still the common penalties for misdemeanours in the VI, while such traditions are no longer in practice in many Malaysian schools.\n\nThe VI is also home to the oldest cadet corps in the country, the Victoria Institution Cadet Corps, the oldest cadet corps band in the country, the Victoria Institution Cadet Corps Band, and the oldest scout group in the country, the First Kuala Lumpur Scout Troop. The First Kuala Lumpur Scout Troop split into two troops in 1933 thus establishing the First Kuala Lumpur Scout Troop and the Second Kuala Lumpur Scout Troop. The official name of the Second Kuala Lumpur Scout Troop today is the Victoria Scout Group.\n\nThe VI has annual events such as the Military Tattoo (performance by marching bands and cadets), Scouts' Campfire (rescue act by senior scouts), Annual Sports Carnival, Speech Days, and Science Fairs. The Victoria Institution is the only school in Malaysia that has its own Edinburgh-styled [[Edinburgh Military Tattoo|Military Tattoo]].\n\nThe school also has its own school magazine and school newspaper. The magazine, The Victorian, is published annually for the benefit of the students. The school newspaper is a periodical, The Seladang (the name derived from the seladang head in the school crest).\n\n=== Sports ===\nThe VI participates in the Bangsar zone at district level and in the MSSKL (Kuala Lumpur School Sports Council) tournament at the state level. Among the sports that the VI participates in are [[soccer|football]], [[rugby union]], [[cricket]], [[basketball]], [[waterpolo]], [[badminton]], [[archery]], [[field hockey|Hockey]], [[team handball|handball]], [[volleyball]], [[sport of athletics|athletics]], [[tennis]] and [[table-tennis]]. VI is the defending champion in football and waterpolo at the state level.\n\nThe VI meets the [[MCKK]] in football for the [[Azlan Shah|Sultan Azlan Shah]] Cup every year with the venue alternating each year between the two schools. Because of its strong tradition in sports, the VI has produced many Malaysian sportsmen including [[Mokhtar Dahari]], [[Misbun Sidek]], [[Rashid Sidek]], Shahrin Majid, [[Razif Sidek]], [[Jalani Sidek]], [[Rahman Sidek]], [[Foo Kok Keong]], Dr Samani Abdul Ghani and [[Mani Jegathesan|Tan Sri Dr Mani Jegathesan]].\n\nThe school's cricket ground first witnessed an international match when [[Ireland cricket team|Ireland]] played [[Gibraltar cricket team|Gibraltar]] in the [[1997 ICC Trophy]], which was hosted by Malaysia. Eight matches in that competition were played at the school premises.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/17/1339_icct.html|title=ICC Trophy Matches played on the Victoria Institution, Kuala Lumpur|publisher=CricketArchive|accessdate=6 October 2011}}</ref> The ground also played host to three [[List A cricket|List A]] fixtures played in the [[Cricket at the 1998 Commonwealth Games|cricket competition at the 1998 Commonwealth Games]]. These fixtures saw [[Pakistan national cricket team|Pakistan]] play [[Scotland cricket team|Scotland]], [[Canada national cricket team|Canada]] played [[India national cricket team|India]], and [[Malaysia national cricket team|Malaysia]] play [[Jamaica national cricket team|Jamaica]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/17/1339_a.html|title=List A Matches played on Victoria Institute, Kuala Lumpur|publisher=CricketArchive|accessdate=6 October 2011}}</ref>\n\n=== Motto ===\n\n{{'}}''Be Yet Wiser; To be a Scholar, Sportsman and a Gentleman''{{'}}\n\nStrictly, the school has no official motto at all. The first motto is actually that of the school newspaper, \"The Seladang\", founded in October 1953. It was selected by the first editor, R. Nithiahnanthan, and displayed on its front-page banner under the head of the seladang taken from the school crest. Over time the motto seems to have been hijacked as that of the school. The motto is derived from the Biblical proverb, \"Give instruction to a wise man and he will be yet wiser.\" See http://viweb.school/seladang.htm.\n\n\"To be a scholar, sportsman and a gentlemen\" was actually quoted from an interview in the school magazine \"The Victorian\", with the then headmaster, Mr V. Murugasu, in the late 1960s, in which the headmaster expressed his belief in what all Victorians should aspire to be.\n\nOver time these two aphorisms seem to have been accepted as school mottos, although there have been no official declarations as such.\n\n=== Houses ===\nThere are eight [[house system|sport houses]] in the VI. The sports houses compete against each other on [[sports day]]. The Victoria Institution Sports Day has been held since 1897, and is widely regarded as a citywide event, with huge crowds converging on the Victoria Institution field in the early days. The [[house system|houses]] are named after the founders, benefactors and even supporters of the school. Initially there were ten houses, including two which do not exist today\u2014Nugent Walsh House and Steve Harper House. After the school premises were moved to the present Petaling Hill and the VI became a secondary school, there were only five houses\u2014Shaw, Treacher, Yap Kwan Seng, Hepponstall and Thamboosamy\u2014because of the fewer number of students. However, after the war, with increased demand for education, three new houses were added\u2014Rodger, Davidson and Loke Yew\u2014making the total eight. The present houses are:\n* [[K. Thamboosamy|Thamboosamy]], green\n* Lee Kuan Yew (formerly known as Hepponstall, named after the first unofficial Principal of VI), yellow\n* [[Sultan Abdul Samad]] (formerly known as Davidson, named after the Infant School supervisor, Elizabeth Davidson), purple\n* [[Rodger]], orange\n* [[Loke Yew]], brown\n* Shaw, red\n* [[Yap Kwan Seng]], light blue\n* Treacher, dark blue\n\n== Alumni Association ==\nThe [[Alumni]] Association of the VI is known as the VIOBA (Victoria Institution Old Boys' Association) and was founded in 1922. The games competition between the Current Victorians and the Old Boys is known as 'Daniel Shield' and this tournament is held every year. There is a similar Alumni Association in Singapore, the VIOBA Singapore.\n\n==Notable alumni==\n* [[Hassanal Bolkiah|Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah]], [[List of Sultans of Brunei|Sultan Of Brunei]]\n* [[Ismail Mohd Ali]], First Governor of Bank Negara Malaysia\n* [[Ananda Krishnan]], businessman and Malaysia's 2nd richest man\n* [[Francis Yeoh]], Managing Director of [[YTL Corporation]]\n* [[Syed Amin Aljeffri]], Malaysian entrepreneur\n*[[Mohamed Hashim bin Mohd Ali]], General (Rtd), former Supreme Commander, [[Chief of Defence Forces (Malaysia)|Chief of Staff]] of the Malaysian Armed Forces\n* [[Mokhtar Dahari]], former [[Malaysia national football team|Malaysian Football]] International\n* [[Lall Singh]], former [[Indian cricket team|Indian]] [[Test cricket]]er\n* [[Raja Petra Kamarudin]], political activist, founder of the [http://malaysia-today.net Malaysia Today] website\n* [[Sinnathamby Rajaratnam|S.

The VI also has its own 25-metre [[swimming pool]] and synthetic track for [[100 metres]] sprint events, making it the only school in the region with these facilities at that time.\n\n== Student life ==\nIt is a rule that all freshman students are required to join at least one uniform body, take on an active role in one of the school's 50 clubs and to participate in a least one sport.\n\n== Rivalry ==\nThe VI has its rivals, both in Kuala Lumpur and nationally. [[St. John's Institution, Kuala Lumpur|St. John's Institution]] and [[Methodist Boys' School (Kuala Lumpur)|MBSSKL]] are the VI's traditional regional archrivals for the past 101 years. This rivalry can be observed during sports tournaments between these three schools. Nationally, the VI also enjoys a rivalry with two elite institutions\u2014the [[Royal Military College, Kuala Lumpur]] and the [[Malay College Kuala Kangsar]]. The rivalry with the former is apparent in football and rugby MSSKL state level tournaments and the rivalry with the latter is evident in the Sultan Azlan Shah Cup, a football playoff between the premier schools of [[Kuala Lumpur]] and [[Kuala Kangsar]], [[Perak]].\n\n=== Traditions and heritage ===\nThe prefect disciplinary system is very much similar to the traditions first laid out by the school's second headmaster, Major Richard Sidney ([http://www.viweb.mysite.com/FirstPref.htm VI First Prefects]).\n\nDetention classes and community service are still the common penalties for misdemeanours in the VI, while such traditions are no longer in practice in many Malaysian schools.\n\nThe VI is also home to the oldest cadet corps in the country, the Victoria Institution Cadet Corps, the oldest cadet corps band in the country, the Victoria Institution Cadet Corps Band, and the oldest scout group in the country, the First Kuala Lumpur Scout Troop. The First Kuala Lumpur Scout Troop split into two troops in 1933 thus establishing the First Kuala Lumpur Scout Troop and the Second Kuala Lumpur Scout Troop. The official name of the Second Kuala Lumpur Scout Troop today is the Victoria Scout Group.\n\nThe VI has annual events such as the Military Tattoo (performance by marching bands and cadets), Scouts' Campfire (rescue act by senior scouts), Annual Sports Carnival, Speech Days, and Science Fairs. The Victoria Institution is the only school in Malaysia that has its own Edinburgh-styled [[Edinburgh Military Tattoo|Military Tattoo]].\n\nThe school also has its own school magazine and school newspaper. The magazine, The Victorian, is published annually for the benefit of the students. The school newspaper is a periodical, The Seladang (the name derived from the seladang head in the school crest).\n\n=== Sports ===\nThe VI participates in the Bangsar zone at district level and in the MSSKL (Kuala Lumpur School Sports Council) tournament at the state level. Among the sports that the VI participates in are [[soccer|football]], [[rugby union]], [[cricket]], [[basketball]], [[waterpolo]], [[badminton]], [[archery]], [[field hockey|Hockey]], [[team handball|handball]], [[volleyball]], [[sport of athletics|athletics]], [[tennis]] and [[table-tennis]]. VI is the defending champion in football and waterpolo at the state level.\n\nThe VI meets the [[MCKK]] in football for the [[Azlan Shah|Sultan Azlan Shah]] Cup every year with the venue alternating each year between the two schools. Because of its strong tradition in sports, the VI has produced many Malaysian sportsmen including [[Mokhtar Dahari]], [[Misbun Sidek]], [[Rashid Sidek]], Shahrin Majid, [[Razif Sidek]], [[Jalani Sidek]], [[Rahman Sidek]], [[Foo Kok Keong]], Dr Samani Abdul Ghani and [[Mani Jegathesan|Tan Sri Dr Mani Jegathesan]].\n\nThe school's cricket ground first witnessed an international match when [[Ireland cricket team|Ireland]] played [[Gibraltar cricket team|Gibraltar]] in the [[1997 ICC Trophy]], which was hosted by Malaysia. Eight matches in that competition were played at the school premises.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/17/1339_icct.html|title=ICC Trophy Matches played on the Victoria Institution, Kuala Lumpur|publisher=CricketArchive|accessdate=6 October 2011}}</ref> The ground also played host to three [[List A cricket|List A]] fixtures played in the [[Cricket at the 1998 Commonwealth Games|cricket competition at the 1998 Commonwealth Games]]. These fixtures saw [[Pakistan national cricket team|Pakistan]] play [[Scotland cricket team|Scotland]], [[Canada national cricket team|Canada]] played [[India national cricket team|India]], and [[Malaysia national cricket team|Malaysia]] play [[Jamaica national cricket team|Jamaica]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/17/1339_a.html|title=List A Matches played on Victoria Institute, Kuala Lumpur|publisher=CricketArchive|accessdate=6 October 2011}}</ref>\n\n=== Motto ===\n\n{{'}}''Be Yet Wiser; To be a Scholar, Sportsman and a Gentleman''{{'}}\n\nStrictly, the school has no official motto at all. The first motto is actually that of the school newspaper, \"The Seladang\", founded in October 1953. It was selected by the first editor, R. Nithiahnanthan, and displayed on its front-page banner under the head of the seladang taken from the school crest. Over time the motto seems to have been hijacked as that of the school. The motto is derived from the Biblical proverb, \"Give instruction to a wise man and he will be yet wiser.\" See http://viweb.school/seladang.htm.\n\n\"To be a scholar, sportsman and a gentlemen\" was actually quoted from an interview in the school magazine \"The Victorian\", with the then headmaster, Mr V. Murugasu, in the late 1960s, in which the headmaster expressed his belief in what all Victorians should aspire to be.\n\nOver time these two aphorisms seem to have been accepted as school mottos, although there have been no official declarations as such.\n\n=== Houses ===\nThere are eight [[house system|sport houses]] in the VI. The sports houses compete against each other on [[sports day]]. The Victoria Institution Sports Day has been held since 1897, and is widely regarded as a citywide event, with huge crowds converging on the Victoria Institution field in the early days. The [[house system|houses]] are named after the founders, benefactors and even supporters of the school. Initially there were ten houses, including two which do not exist today\u2014Nugent Walsh House and Steve Harper House. After the school premises were moved to the present Petaling Hill and the VI became a secondary school, there were only five houses\u2014Shaw, Treacher, Yap Kwan Seng, Hepponstall and Thamboosamy\u2014because of the fewer number of students. However, after the war, with increased demand for education, three new houses were added\u2014Rodger, Davidson and Loke Yew\u2014making the total eight. The present houses are:\n* [[K. Thamboosamy|Thamboosamy]], green\n* Lee Kuan Yew (formerly known as Hepponstall, named after the first unofficial Principal of VI), yellow\n* [[Sultan Abdul Samad]] (formerly known as Davidson, named after the Infant School supervisor, Elizabeth Davidson), purple\n* [[Rodger]], orange\n* [[Loke Yew]], brown\n* Shaw, red\n* [[Yap Kwan Seng]], light blue\n* Treacher, dark blue\n\n== Alumni Association ==\nThe [[Alumni]] Association of the VI is known as the VIOBA (Victoria Institution Old Boys' Association) and was founded in 1922. The games competition between the Current Victorians and the Old Boys is known as 'Daniel Shield' and this tournament is held every year. There is a similar Alumni Association in Singapore, the VIOBA Singapore.\n\n==Notable alumni==\n* [[Hassanal Bolkiah|Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah]], [[List of Sultans of Brunei|Sultan Of Brunei]]\n* [[Ismail Mohd Ali]], First Governor of Bank Negara Malaysia\n* [[Ananda Krishnan]], businessman and Malaysia's 2nd richest man\n* [[Francis Yeoh]], Managing Director of [[YTL Corporation]]\n* [[Syed Amin Aljeffri]], Malaysian entrepreneur\n*[[Mohamed Hashim bin Mohd Ali]], General (Rtd), former Supreme Commander, [[Chief of Defence Forces (Malaysia)|Chief of Staff]] of the Malaysian Armed Forces\n* [[Mokhtar Dahari]], former [[Malaysia national football team|Malaysian Football]] International\n* [[Lall Singh]], former [[Indian cricket team|Indian]] [[Test cricket]]er\n* [[Raja Petra Kamarudin]], political activist, founder of the [http://malaysia-today.net Malaysia Today] website\n* [[Sinnathamby Rajaratnam|S.

On December 1, 1936, as part of the publicity campaign for the new program, Joseph L. Fay of the Social Security Administration selected a record from the top of the first stack of 1,000 records and announced that the first Social Security number in history was assigned to John David Sweeney, Jr., of [[New Rochelle, New York]]. However, since the Social Security numbers were not assigned in chronological order, Sweeney did not receive the lowest Social Security number, 001-01-0001. That distinction belongs to Grace D.

A few duplications did occur when prenumbered cards were sent out to regional SSA offices and (originally) Post Offices. \n\nEmployee, patient, student, and [[Credit history|credit]] records are sometimes indexed by Social Security number.\n\nThe [[Military of the United States|U.S. Armed Forces]] has used the Social Security number as an identification number for Army and Air Force personnel since July 1, 1969, the Navy and Marine Corps for their personnel since January 1, 1972, and the Coast Guard for their personnel since October 1, 1974.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.archives.gov/personnel-records-center/social-security-numbers |publisher=National Archives |access-date=October 19, 2018 |title=Service Numbers and Social Security Numbers|date=2016-08-15 }}</ref> Previously, the United States military used a much more complicated system of [[Service number (United States)|service numbers]] that varied by service.\n\nBeginning in June 2011, DOD began removing the Social Security number from military identification cards.

The most common type contains the cardholder's name and number.  Such cards are issued to U.S. citizens and U.S. permanent residents. There are also two restricted types of Social Security cards:\n* One reads \"not valid for employment.\" Such cards cannot be used as proof of work authorization, and are not acceptable as a List C document on the I-9 form.\n* The other reads \"valid for work only with DHS authorization\", or the older, \"valid for work only with INS authorization.\" These cards are issued to people who have temporary work authorization in the U.S.  They can satisfy the I-9 requirement, if they are accompanied by a work authorization card.\n\nIn 2004 Congress passed The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act; parts of which mandated that the Social Security Administration redesign the Social Security Number (SSN) Card to prevent forgery. From April 2006 through August 2007, [[Social Security Administration]] (SSA) and [[United States Government Publishing Office|Government Printing Office]] (GPO) employees were assigned to redesign the Social Security Number Card to the specifications of the Interagency Task Force created by the Commissioner of Social Security in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security.\n\nThe new SSN card design utilizes both covert and overt security features created by the SSA and GPO design teams.\n\n== Identity theft ==\n[[File:Dog Tag WWII P.jpg|thumb|[[Dog tag]] from [[World War II]] (possibly Army-Air Corps), labeled \"P\" for [[Protestant]].]]\n\nMany citizens and [[privacy]] advocates are concerned about the disclosure and processing of Social Security numbers.  Furthermore, researchers at [[Carnegie Mellon University]] have demonstrated an algorithm that uses publicly available personal information to reconstruct a given SSN.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/science/2009/07/social-insecurity-numbers-open-to-hacking/ |first=John |last=Timmer |publisher=Ars Technica |date=July 17, 2009 |access-date=October 19, 2018 |title=New algorithm guesses SSNs using date and place of birth}}</ref>\n\nThe SSN is frequently used by those involved in [[identity theft]], since it is interconnected with many other forms of identification, and because people asking for it treat it as an [[authentication|authenticator]]. Financial institutions generally require an SSN to set up [[bank account]]s, [[credit card]]s, and loans\u2014partly because they assume that no one except the person it was issued to knows it.\n\nExacerbating the problem of using the Social Security number as an identifier is the fact that the Social Security card contains no [[Biometrics|biometric]] identifiers of any sort, making it essentially impossible to tell whether a person using a certain SSN truly belongs to someone without relying on other documentation (which may itself have been falsely procured through use of the fraudulent SSN). Congress has proposed federal laws that restrict the use of SSNs for identification and bans their use for a number of commercial purposes\u2014e.g., rental applications.<ref>{{cite web |access-date=October 19, 2018 |publisher=News.cnet.com |last=Broache |title=Congress may slap restrictions on SSN use - CNET News |url=http://news.cnet.com/Congress+may+slap+restrictions+on+SSN+use/2100-7348_3-6071441.html?tag=nefd.top |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120711052547/http://news.cnet.com/Congress-may-slap-restrictions-on-SSN-use/2100-7348_3-6071441.html |archive-date=2012-07-11 |first=Anne}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) offers alternatives to SSNs in some places where providing untrusted parties with identification numbers is essential. Tax return preparers must obtain and use a [[Preparer Tax Identification Number]] (PTIN) to include on their client's tax returns (as part of signature requirements). Day care services have tax benefits, and even a sole proprietor should give parents an EIN (employer identification number) to use on their tax return.\n\nThe Social Security Administration has suggested that, if asked to provide his or her Social Security number, a citizen should ask which law requires its use.<ref name=\"howcaniprotect\"/> In accordance with \u00a77213 of the [[9/11 Commission Implementation Act of 2004]] and {{USCFR|20|422|103|(e)(2)}}, the number of replacement Social Security cards per person is generally limited to three per calendar year and ten in a [[life]]time.<ref name=\"howcaniprotect\">{{cite web |url=https://www.ssa.gov/pubs/10002.html |publisher=Social Security Administration |access-date=October 19, 2018 |title=Your Social Security Number And Card, \"How can I protect my Social Security number?\"}}</ref>\n\nIdentity confusion has also occurred because of the use of local Social Security numbers by the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and the Republic of Palau, whose numbers overlap with those of residents of New Hampshire and Maine.<ref>{{cite news |access-date=October 19, 2018 |publisher=The Plain Dealer |first=Bill |last=Meyer |title=How many Americans' Social Security numbers were officially duplicated for Pacific islanders? |url=https://www.cleveland.com/nation/index.ssf/2009/08/how_many_americans_social_secu.html |date=August 17, 2009}}</ref>\n\n== Replacement numbers ==\n\nA person can request a new Social Security number, but only under certain conditions;<ref>{{cite web |title=Can I change my Social Security number?|url=https://faq.ssa.gov/en-us/Topic/article/KA-02220 |website=Social Security Administration |access-date=October 19, 2018}}</ref>\n\n* Where sequential numbers assigned to members of the same family are causing problems.\n* In the event of duplicates having been issued.\n*In cases where the person has been a victim of domestic violence or harassment, and there is a clear need to change their number for their personal safety.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ssa.gov/pubs/EN-05-10093.pdf |website=Social Security Administration |access-date=October 19, 2018 |title=New Numbers for Domestic Violence Victims }}</ref>\n*When a person has been a victim of identity theft, and their Social Security number continues to be problematic.\n* Where a person has a demonstrable religious objection to a number (such as certain Christians being averse to the number [[Number of the Beast|666]]).\n\nFor all of these conditions, credible third-party evidence such as a restraining order or police report is required.\n\n== Structure ==\n\nThe Social Security number is a nine-digit number in the format \"AAA-GG-SSSS\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ssa.gov/history/ssn/geocard.html |access-date=October 19, 2018 |author=Social Security Administration |title=The SSN Numbering Scheme}}</ref> The number is divided into three parts: the first three digits, known as the ''area number'' because they were formerly assigned by geographical region; the middle two digits, known as the ''group number''; and the final four digits, known as the ''serial number.''\n\nOn June 25, 2011, the SSA changed the SSN assignment process to \"SSN randomization\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ssa.gov/employer/randomization.html |publisher=Socialsecurity.gov |access-date=October 19, 2018 |title=Social Security Number Randomization}}</ref> SSN randomization affected the SSN assignment process in the following ways:\n\n# It eliminated the geographical significance of the first three digits of the SSN, referred to as the area number, by no longer allocating specific numbers by state for assignment to individuals.\n# It eliminated the significance of the highest group number assigned for each area number, and, as a result, the High Group List is frozen in time and can be used for validation of only those SSNs issued prior to the randomization implementation date (see section \"Valid SSNs\").\n# Previously unassigned area numbers have been introduced for assignment, excluding area numbers 000, 666 and 900\u2013999.\nBecause [[Individual Taxpayer Identification Number]]s (ITINs) are issued by the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS), they were not affected by this SSA change.\n\n=== Historical structure ===\nPrior to the 2011 randomization process, the first three digits or [[#List of Social Security Area Numbers|area number]] were assigned by geographical region. Prior to 1973, cards were issued in local Social Security offices around the country and the area number represented the office code where the card was issued. This did not necessarily have to be in the area where the applicant lived, since a person could apply for their card in any Social Security office. Beginning in 1973, when the SSA began assigning SSNs and issuing cards centrally from [[Baltimore]], the area number was assigned based on the [[ZIP Code]] in the mailing address provided on the application for the original Social Security card. The applicant's mailing address did not have to be the same as their place of residence. Thus, the area number did not necessarily represent the state of residence of the applicant regardless of whether the card was issued prior to, or after, 1973.\n\nGenerally, numbers were assigned beginning in the [[Northeastern United States|northeast]] and moving south and westward, so that people applying from addresses on the east coast had the lowest numbers and those on the west coast had the highest numbers. As the areas assigned to a locality were exhausted, new areas from the pool were assigned, so some states had noncontiguous groups of numbers.\n\nThe middle two digits or ''group number'' range from 01 to 99. Even before SSN randomization, the group numbers were not assigned consecutively within an area. Instead, for administrative reasons, group numbers were issued in the following order:<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ssa.gov/history/ssn/geocard.html |publisher=SocialSecurity.gov |access-date=October 19, 2018 |title=The SSN Numbering Scheme}}</ref>\n\n#  odd numbers from 01 through 09\n#  even numbers from 10 through 98\n#  even numbers from 02 through 08\n#  odd numbers from 11 through 99\n\nAs an example, group number 98 would be issued before 11.\n\nThe last four digits are ''serial numbers''. Before SSN randomization took effect, they represented a straight numerical sequence of digits from 0001 to 9999 within the group.\n\n===  Valid SSNs  ===\n\nPrior to June 25, 2011, a valid SSN could not have an area number between 734 and 749, or above 772, the highest area number the Social Security Administration had allocated. Effective June 25, 2011, the SSA assigns SSNs randomly and allows for the assignment of area numbers between 734 and 749 and above 772 through the 800s.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ssa.gov/employer/stateweb.htm |publisher=Social Security Administration |access-date=October 19, 2018 |title=Social Security Number Allocations}}</ref>  This should not be confused with Tax Identification Numbers (TINs), which include additional area numbers.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/taxpayer-identification-numbers-tin |title=Taxpayer Identification Numbers (TIN) |publisher=Internal Revenue Service |date=May 2, 2018 |access-date=October 19, 2018}}</ref>\n\nSome special numbers are never allocated:\n*  Numbers with all zeros in any digit group (''000''-##-####, ###-''00''-####, ###-##-''0000'').<ref name=\"FAQInvalid\">{{cite web |url=https://www.ssa.gov/employer/randomization.html |publisher=Social Security Administration |access-date=October 19, 2018 |title=Social Security Number Randomization}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |access-date=October 19, 2018 |publisher=United States Social Security Administration |title=RM 10201.035 Invalid Social Security Numbers (SSNs) |url=https://secure.ssa.gov/apps10/poms.nsf/lnx/0110201035 |work=Program Operations Manual System (POMS) |date=June 23, 2011}}</ref>\n*  Numbers with 666 or 900\u2013999 ([[Individual Taxpayer Identification Number]]) in the first digit group.<ref name=\"FAQInvalid\" />\n\nUntil 2011, the SSA published the last group number used for each area number.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ssa.gov/employer/ssnvhighgroup.htm |publisher=Social Security Administration |access-date=October 19, 2018 |title=High Group List And Other Ways To Determine If An SSN Is Valid}}</ref> Since group numbers were allocated in a regular pattern, it was possible to identify an unissued SSN that contained an invalid group number.

It has issued over 450 million since the start of the program, and at a use rate of about 5.5 million per year. It says it has enough to last several generations without reuse or changing the number of digits.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ssa.gov/history/hfaq.html |publisher=United States Social Security Administration |access-date=October 19, 2018 |title=Q20: Are Social Security numbers reused after a person dies?}}</ref> However, there have been instances where multiple individuals have been inadvertently assigned the same Social Security number.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pcworld.com/article/3004654/government/a-tale-of-two-women-same-birthday-same-social-security-number-same-big-data-mess.html |publisher=PC World |first=Katherine |last=Noyes |date=November 12, 2015 |access-date=October 19, 2018 |title=A tale of two women: same birthday, same Social Security number, same big-data mess}}</ref>\n\n== SSNs used in advertising ==\n[[File:Walletssn2.gif|thumb|The promotional [[Social Security card]] as distributed by the [[F.W. Woolworth Company]]]]\n\nSome SSNs used in advertising have rendered those numbers invalid. One famous instance of this occurred in 1938 when the [[E. H. Ferree Company]] in [[Lockport (city), New York|Lockport, New York]], decided to promote its product by showing how a Social Security card would fit into its [[wallet]]s. A sample card, used for display purposes, was placed in each wallet, which was sold by [[F.W. Woolworth Company|Woolworth]] and other department stores across the country; the wallet manufacturer's vice president and treasurer Douglas Patterson used the actual SSN of his secretary, Hilda Schrader Whitcher.\n\nEven though the card was printed in red (the real card is printed in blue) and had \"Specimen\" printed across the front, many people used Whitcher's SSN as their own. The Social Security Administration's account of the incident also claims that the fake card was half the size of a real card, despite a miniature card's being useless for its purpose and despite  Whitcher's holding two cards of apparently identical size in the accompanying photograph. Over time, the number that appeared (078-05-1120) has been claimed by a total of over 40,000 people as their own.<ref name=\"Misused\">{{cite web |url=https://www.ssa.gov/history/ssn/misused.html |title=Social Security Cards Issued by Woolworth |publisher=Social Security Administration |access-date=October 19, 2018}}</ref> The SSA initiated an advertising campaign stating that it was incorrect to use the number (Hilda Whitcher was issued a new SSN). However, the number was found to be in use by 12 individuals as late as 1977.<ref name=\"Misused\" />\n\nMore recently, [[Todd Davis]] distributed his SSN in advertisements for his company's [[LifeLock]] identity theft protection service, which allowed his identity to be stolen over a dozen times.<ref name=\"13times\">{{cite web |access-date=October 19, 2018 |last=Zetter |title=LifeLock CEO's Identity Stolen 13 Times |url=https://www.wired.com/2010/05/lifelock-identity-theft/ |work=Wired |date=May 18, 2010 |first=Kim}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |access-date=October 19, 2018 |work=ComputerWorld |date=May 19, 2010 |first=Jaikumar |last=Vijayan |title=LifeLock CEO said to be victim of identity theft 13 times |url=https://www.computerworld.com/article/2517761/data-privacy/lifelock-ceo-said-to-be-victim-of-identity-theft-13-times.html}}</ref>\n\n==List of Social Security Area Numbers==\nList showing the geographical location of the first three digits of the social security numbers assigned in the [[United States]] and its territories from 1973 until June 25, 2011.

On December 1, 1936, as part of the publicity campaign for the new program, Joseph L. Fay of the Social Security Administration selected a record from the top of the first stack of 1,000 records and announced that the first Social Security number in history was assigned to John David Sweeney, Jr., of [[New Rochelle, New York]]. However, since the Social Security numbers were not assigned in chronological order, Sweeney did not receive the lowest Social Security number, 001-01-0001. That distinction belongs to Grace D.

It has since come to be used as an identifier for individuals within the United States, although rare errors occur where duplicates do exist.  As numbers are now assigned by the central issuing office of the SSA, it is unlikely that duplication will ever occur again. A few duplications did occur when prenumbered cards were sent out to regional SSA offices and (originally) Post Offices. \n\nEmployee, patient, student, and [[Credit history|credit]] records are sometimes indexed by Social Security number.\n\nThe [[Military of the United States|U.S. Armed Forces]] has used the Social Security number as an identification number for Army and Air Force personnel since July 1, 1969, the Navy and Marine Corps for their personnel since January 1, 1972, and the Coast Guard for their personnel since October 1, 1974.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.archives.gov/personnel-records-center/social-security-numbers |publisher=National Archives |access-date=October 19, 2018 |title=Service Numbers and Social Security Numbers|date=2016-08-15 }}</ref> Previously, the United States military used a much more complicated system of [[Service number (United States)|service numbers]] that varied by service.\n\nBeginning in June 2011, DOD began removing the Social Security number from military identification cards.

The most common type contains the cardholder's name and number.  Such cards are issued to U.S. citizens and U.S. permanent residents. There are also two restricted types of Social Security cards:\n* One reads \"not valid for employment.\" Such cards cannot be used as proof of work authorization, and are not acceptable as a List C document on the I-9 form.\n* The other reads \"valid for work only with DHS authorization\", or the older, \"valid for work only with INS authorization.\" These cards are issued to people who have temporary work authorization in the U.S.  They can satisfy the I-9 requirement, if they are accompanied by a work authorization card.\n\nIn 2004 Congress passed The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act; parts of which mandated that the Social Security Administration redesign the Social Security Number (SSN) Card to prevent forgery. From April 2006 through August 2007, [[Social Security Administration]] (SSA) and [[United States Government Publishing Office|Government Printing Office]] (GPO) employees were assigned to redesign the Social Security Number Card to the specifications of the Interagency Task Force created by the Commissioner of Social Security in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security.\n\nThe new SSN card design utilizes both covert and overt security features created by the SSA and GPO design teams.\n\n== Identity theft ==\n[[File:Dog Tag WWII P.jpg|thumb|[[Dog tag]] from [[World War II]] (possibly Army-Air Corps), labeled \"P\" for [[Protestant]].]]\n\nMany citizens and [[privacy]] advocates are concerned about the disclosure and processing of Social Security numbers.  Furthermore, researchers at [[Carnegie Mellon University]] have demonstrated an algorithm that uses publicly available personal information to reconstruct a given SSN.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/science/2009/07/social-insecurity-numbers-open-to-hacking/ |first=John |last=Timmer |publisher=Ars Technica |date=July 17, 2009 |access-date=October 19, 2018 |title=New algorithm guesses SSNs using date and place of birth}}</ref>\n\nThe SSN is frequently used by those involved in [[identity theft]], since it is interconnected with many other forms of identification, and because people asking for it treat it as an [[authentication|authenticator]]. Financial institutions generally require an SSN to set up [[bank account]]s, [[credit card]]s, and loans\u2014partly because they assume that no one except the person it was issued to knows it.\n\nExacerbating the problem of using the Social Security number as an identifier is the fact that the Social Security card contains no [[Biometrics|biometric]] identifiers of any sort, making it essentially impossible to tell whether a person using a certain SSN truly belongs to someone without relying on other documentation (which may itself have been falsely procured through use of the fraudulent SSN). Congress has proposed federal laws that restrict the use of SSNs for identification and bans their use for a number of commercial purposes\u2014e.g., rental applications.<ref>{{cite web |access-date=October 19, 2018 |publisher=News.cnet.com |last=Broache |title=Congress may slap restrictions on SSN use - CNET News |url=http://news.cnet.com/Congress+may+slap+restrictions+on+SSN+use/2100-7348_3-6071441.html?tag=nefd.top |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120711052547/http://news.cnet.com/Congress-may-slap-restrictions-on-SSN-use/2100-7348_3-6071441.html |archive-date=2012-07-11 |first=Anne}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) offers alternatives to SSNs in some places where providing untrusted parties with identification numbers is essential. Tax return preparers must obtain and use a [[Preparer Tax Identification Number]] (PTIN) to include on their client's tax returns (as part of signature requirements). Day care services have tax benefits, and even a sole proprietor should give parents an EIN (employer identification number) to use on their tax return.\n\nThe Social Security Administration has suggested that, if asked to provide his or her Social Security number, a citizen should ask which law requires its use.<ref name=\"howcaniprotect\"/> In accordance with \u00a77213 of the [[9/11 Commission Implementation Act of 2004]] and {{USCFR|20|422|103|(e)(2)}}, the number of replacement Social Security cards per person is generally limited to three per calendar year and ten in a [[life]]time.<ref name=\"howcaniprotect\">{{cite web |url=https://www.ssa.gov/pubs/10002.html |publisher=Social Security Administration |access-date=October 19, 2018 |title=Your Social Security Number And Card, \"How can I protect my Social Security number?\"}}</ref>\n\nIdentity confusion has also occurred because of the use of local Social Security numbers by the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and the Republic of Palau, whose numbers overlap with those of residents of New Hampshire and Maine.<ref>{{cite news |access-date=October 19, 2018 |publisher=The Plain Dealer |first=Bill |last=Meyer |title=How many Americans' Social Security numbers were officially duplicated for Pacific islanders? |url=https://www.cleveland.com/nation/index.ssf/2009/08/how_many_americans_social_secu.html |date=August 17, 2009}}</ref>\n\n== Replacement numbers ==\n\nA person can request a new Social Security number, but only under certain conditions;<ref>{{cite web |title=Can I change my Social Security number?|url=https://faq.ssa.gov/en-us/Topic/article/KA-02220 |website=Social Security Administration |access-date=October 19, 2018}}</ref>\n\n* Where sequential numbers assigned to members of the same family are causing problems.\n* In the event of duplicates having been issued.\n*In cases where the person has been a victim of domestic violence or harassment, and there is a clear need to change their number for their personal safety.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ssa.gov/pubs/EN-05-10093.pdf |website=Social Security Administration |access-date=October 19, 2018 |title=New Numbers for Domestic Violence Victims }}</ref>\n*When a person has been a victim of identity theft, and their Social Security number continues to be problematic.\n* Where a person has a demonstrable religious objection to a number (such as certain Christians being averse to the number [[Number of the Beast|666]]).\n\nFor all of these conditions, credible third-party evidence such as a restraining order or police report is required.\n\n== Structure ==\n\nThe Social Security number is a nine-digit number in the format \"AAA-GG-SSSS\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ssa.gov/history/ssn/geocard.html |access-date=October 19, 2018 |author=Social Security Administration |title=The SSN Numbering Scheme}}</ref> The number is divided into three parts: the first three digits, known as the ''area number'' because they were formerly assigned by geographical region; the middle two digits, known as the ''group number''; and the final four digits, known as the ''serial number.''\n\nOn June 25, 2011, the SSA changed the SSN assignment process to \"SSN randomization\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ssa.gov/employer/randomization.html |publisher=Socialsecurity.gov |access-date=October 19, 2018 |title=Social Security Number Randomization}}</ref> SSN randomization affected the SSN assignment process in the following ways:\n\n# It eliminated the geographical significance of the first three digits of the SSN, referred to as the area number, by no longer allocating specific numbers by state for assignment to individuals.\n# It eliminated the significance of the highest group number assigned for each area number, and, as a result, the High Group List is frozen in time and can be used for validation of only those SSNs issued prior to the randomization implementation date (see section \"Valid SSNs\").\n# Previously unassigned area numbers have been introduced for assignment, excluding area numbers 000, 666 and 900\u2013999.\nBecause [[Individual Taxpayer Identification Number]]s (ITINs) are issued by the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS), they were not affected by this SSA change.\n\n=== Historical structure ===\nPrior to the 2011 randomization process, the first three digits or [[#List of Social Security Area Numbers|area number]] were assigned by geographical region. Prior to 1973, cards were issued in local Social Security offices around the country and the area number represented the office code where the card was issued. This did not necessarily have to be in the area where the applicant lived, since a person could apply for their card in any Social Security office. Beginning in 1973, when the SSA began assigning SSNs and issuing cards centrally from [[Baltimore]], the area number was assigned based on the [[ZIP Code]] in the mailing address provided on the application for the original Social Security card. The applicant's mailing address did not have to be the same as their place of residence. Thus, the area number did not necessarily represent the state of residence of the applicant regardless of whether the card was issued prior to, or after, 1973.\n\nGenerally, numbers were assigned beginning in the [[Northeastern United States|northeast]] and moving south and westward, so that people applying from addresses on the east coast had the lowest numbers and those on the west coast had the highest numbers. As the areas assigned to a locality were exhausted, new areas from the pool were assigned, so some states had noncontiguous groups of numbers.\n\nThe middle two digits or ''group number'' range from 01 to 99. Even before SSN randomization, the group numbers were not assigned consecutively within an area. Instead, for administrative reasons, group numbers were issued in the following order:<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ssa.gov/history/ssn/geocard.html |publisher=SocialSecurity.gov |access-date=October 19, 2018 |title=The SSN Numbering Scheme}}</ref>\n\n#  odd numbers from 01 through 09\n#  even numbers from 10 through 98\n#  even numbers from 02 through 08\n#  odd numbers from 11 through 99\n\nAs an example, group number 98 would be issued before 11.\n\nThe last four digits are ''serial numbers''. Before SSN randomization took effect, they represented a straight numerical sequence of digits from 0001 to 9999 within the group.\n\n===  Valid SSNs  ===\n\nPrior to June 25, 2011, a valid SSN could not have an area number between 734 and 749, or above 772, the highest area number the Social Security Administration had allocated. Effective June 25, 2011, the SSA assigns SSNs randomly and allows for the assignment of area numbers between 734 and 749 and above 772 through the 800s.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ssa.gov/employer/stateweb.htm |publisher=Social Security Administration |access-date=October 19, 2018 |title=Social Security Number Allocations}}</ref>  This should not be confused with Tax Identification Numbers (TINs), which include additional area numbers.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/taxpayer-identification-numbers-tin |title=Taxpayer Identification Numbers (TIN) |publisher=Internal Revenue Service |date=May 2, 2018 |access-date=October 19, 2018}}</ref>\n\nSome special numbers are never allocated:\n*  Numbers with all zeros in any digit group (''000''-##-####, ###-''00''-####, ###-##-''0000'').<ref name=\"FAQInvalid\">{{cite web |url=https://www.ssa.gov/employer/randomization.html |publisher=Social Security Administration |access-date=October 19, 2018 |title=Social Security Number Randomization}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |access-date=October 19, 2018 |publisher=United States Social Security Administration |title=RM 10201.035 Invalid Social Security Numbers (SSNs) |url=https://secure.ssa.gov/apps10/poms.nsf/lnx/0110201035 |work=Program Operations Manual System (POMS) |date=June 23, 2011}}</ref>\n*  Numbers with 666 or 900\u2013999 ([[Individual Taxpayer Identification Number]]) in the first digit group.<ref name=\"FAQInvalid\" />\n\nUntil 2011, the SSA published the last group number used for each area number.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ssa.gov/employer/ssnvhighgroup.htm |publisher=Social Security Administration |access-date=October 19, 2018 |title=High Group List And Other Ways To Determine If An SSN Is Valid}}</ref> Since group numbers were allocated in a regular pattern, it was possible to identify an unissued SSN that contained an invalid group number. Now numbers are assigned randomly, and fraudulent SSNs are not easily detectable with publicly available information. Many online services, however, provide SSN validation.\n\nUnlike many similar numbers, no [[check digit]] is included.\n\n===Exhaustion and re-use===\n\nThe Social Security Administration does not reuse Social Security numbers. It has issued over 450 million since the start of the program, and at a use rate of about 5.5 million per year. It says it has enough to last several generations without reuse or changing the number of digits.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ssa.gov/history/hfaq.html |publisher=United States Social Security Administration |access-date=October 19, 2018 |title=Q20: Are Social Security numbers reused after a person dies?}}</ref> However, there have been instances where multiple individuals have been inadvertently assigned the same Social Security number.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pcworld.com/article/3004654/government/a-tale-of-two-women-same-birthday-same-social-security-number-same-big-data-mess.html |publisher=PC World |first=Katherine |last=Noyes |date=November 12, 2015 |access-date=October 19, 2018 |title=A tale of two women: same birthday, same Social Security number, same big-data mess}}</ref>\n\n== SSNs used in advertising ==\n[[File:Walletssn2.gif|thumb|The promotional [[Social Security card]] as distributed by the [[F.W. Woolworth Company]]]]\n\nSome SSNs used in advertising have rendered those numbers invalid. One famous instance of this occurred in 1938 when the [[E. H. Ferree Company]] in [[Lockport (city), New York|Lockport, New York]], decided to promote its product by showing how a Social Security card would fit into its [[wallet]]s. A sample card, used for display purposes, was placed in each wallet, which was sold by [[F.W. Woolworth Company|Woolworth]] and other department stores across the country; the wallet manufacturer's vice president and treasurer Douglas Patterson used the actual SSN of his secretary, Hilda Schrader Whitcher.\n\nEven though the card was printed in red (the real card is printed in blue) and had \"Specimen\" printed across the front, many people used Whitcher's SSN as their own. The Social Security Administration's account of the incident also claims that the fake card was half the size of a real card, despite a miniature card's being useless for its purpose and despite  Whitcher's holding two cards of apparently identical size in the accompanying photograph. Over time, the number that appeared (078-05-1120) has been claimed by a total of over 40,000 people as their own.<ref name=\"Misused\">{{cite web |url=https://www.ssa.gov/history/ssn/misused.html |title=Social Security Cards Issued by Woolworth |publisher=Social Security Administration |access-date=October 19, 2018}}</ref> The SSA initiated an advertising campaign stating that it was incorrect to use the number (Hilda Whitcher was issued a new SSN).

His mother was Sarah Wheeler, daughter of [[Jonas Wheeler (bishop)|Jonas Wheeler]], [[Bishop of Ossory]] and his wife Martha Tucker; Sarah was  the widow of Mathew Tyrrell.\n\nHe graduated from [[Trinity College Dublin]] in 1666. Although he had originally intended to become a soldier, he later  resolved on a legal career instead, and entered [[Middle Temple]] in 1669. He seems to have been  an exceptionally unruly student: he  was fined for breaking down doors and for gambling at Christmas.\n\nHe was called to the [[Irish Bar]] about 1672 and became Commissioner of Revenue Appeals in 1677. After the [[Glorious Revolution|Revolution of 1688]] he lived for a time in England.\n\nHe was appointed [[Serjeant-at-law (Ireland)|Prime Serjeant]] on 29 December 1692 and represented the borough of [[Galway Borough (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|Galway]] in the [[Irish House of Commons]] from 1692 to 1693. In 1693 he was  made [[Recorder of Dublin]].\n\n==Judge==\n\nHe was raised to the  High Court bench as a Puisne Baron of the Irish [[Exchequer of Ireland|Court of Exchequer]] in 1695, and on 31 December 1696 was made  one of the Commissioners of the [[Great Seal of the Realm|Great Seal of Ireland]], pending the appointment of [[John Methuen (diplomat)|John Methuen]] as [[Lord Chancellor of Ireland]] in 1697. He became [[Chief Baron of the Exchequer (Ireland)|Chief Baron of the Exchequer]] on 27 December 1703, holding the office until his death. His elevation to the Bench was said to be part of an effort to remove judges  who were suspected of [[Tory]] or pro-Catholic views; but it is perhaps  surprising that Donnellan, who was a descendant of an Old Irish, [[Irish language|Gaelic]]-speaking family which had several  [[Roman Catholic]] members, was not suspected of   Catholic and Tory sympathies himself.\n\nIn 1698 the Irish born writer and publisher [[John Dunton]], on a visit to Dublin, gave a favourable verdict on the Irish judiciary, including Donnellan: \"men whose reputation is such that no one complains of them\".\n\n==Family==\n\nHe married twice; little is known of his first wife, who died before 1688, leaving one surviving son, James. He remarried Martha Ussher, daughter of Christopher Ussher, who outlived him by many years, and married secondly Phillip Perceval, brother of the 1st [[Earl of Egmont]]. Nehemiah and Martha had two sons, Nehemiah, MP for [[Tipperary (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|Tipperary]], and Christopher, and two daughters, Katherine and [[Anne Donnellan|Anne]] (died 1762).\n\nHis daughter Anne is remembered today as the friend of most of the leading Irish writers of her time, and for founding the Donnellan Lectures at Trinity College Dublin. Her sister Katherine married [[Robert Clayton (bishop)|Robert Clayton]], [[Bishop of Cork and Ross]]. The artist and letter writer [[Mary Delaney]] wrote an unflattering sketch of Katherine  as \"giving herself the airs of a Queen\" after her husband was made a bishop. She may well have come to regret his promotion, as his religious opinions were so unorthodox as to raise doubts as to whether he was a [[Christians|Christian]] at all. [[Horace Walpole]] said unkindly that Clayton's  writings seemed calculated to destroy anyone's  Christian faith, and it seems that only his sudden death in 1758  averted an inquiry by his fellow bishops into charges of [[heresy]].\n\n[[File:Robert and Katherine Clayton.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Robert Clayton and his wife Katherine, daughter of Nehemiah Donnellan]]\n\n==References==\n* Ball, Francis Elrington   ''The Judges in Ireland 1221-1921''  John Murray London 1926\n* Joseph Haydn and Horace Ockerby, ''The Book of Dignities'', 3rd edition, London 1894 (reprinted Bath 1969)\n* Gerard, Frances  ''Picturesque Dublin Old and New'' Hutchinson and Co London 1898\n* http://www.leighrayment.com/commons/irelandcommons.htm\n* http://www.ballyd.com/history/baron.html\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Donnellan, Nehemiah}}\n[[Category:1649 births]]\n[[Category:1705 deaths]]\n[[Category:Irish MPs 1692\u20131693]]\n[[Category:Lawyers from Dublin (city)\u200e]]\n[[Category:People from County Galway]]\n[[Category:Members of the Middle Temple]]\n[[Category:Chief Barons of the Irish Exchequer]]\n[[Category:Recorders of Dublin]]\n[[Category:Members of the Parliament of Ireland (pre-1801) for County Galway constituencies]]\n[[Category:Serjeants-at-law (Ireland)]]\n", "text_old": "{{other uses|Nehemiah Donnellan (disambiguation)}}\n{{short description|Irish judge}}\n\n'''Nehemiah Donnellan''' (1649 &ndash; 25 December 1705) was an Irish lawyer and [[judge]].\n\n==Early life==\n\nHe was the son of Sir [[James Donnellan]], [[Chief Justice of the Irish Common Pleas]]  and grandson of [[Nehemiah Donnellan]], [[Archbishop of Tuam]] and Elizabeth O'Donnell.
