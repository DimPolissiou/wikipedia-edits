The earliest reported case in which he was engaged was tried in the Queen's Bench in Hilary term 1597\u20138, when he acted as junior to the attorney-general, [[Edward Coke|Coke]]. In 1604 he was selected by the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] to state objections to the adoption of the new style of king of Great Britain in the conference with the [[House of Lords|lords]].\n\n==Involvement in leading trials==\nHis name does not appear in the official list of returns to parliament after 1597. He was certainly, however, the member for [[Saltash (UK Parliament constituency)|Saltash]] in 1614, and was elected [[Speaker of the British House of Commons|speaker]] (7 April). He was knighted in June, and took the degree of [[serjeant-at-law]] in July of the following year. In the address with which, according to custom, he opened the session in 1614, he enlarged upon the length of the royal pedigree, to which he gave a fabulous extension.\n\nIn January 1614\u201315 Crewe was appointed one of the commissioners for the examination, under [[torture]], of  the [[Puritan]] minister Edmond Peacham for [[high treason]], in that his attacks, which were never published,  on the King and his ministers could be construed as incitement to [[regicide]] and [[rebellion]]. Peacham refused to speak even after being tortured on the [[rack (torture)|rack]].  Crewe concurred with the advice of the majority of the High Court judges that Peacham's unpublished writings clearly amounted to treason, although Coke in a celebrated ruling  called ''Peacham's Case'' vehemently disagreed. Peacham was sent down to [[Somersetshire]] to stand his trial at the [[assizes]]. Crewe prosecuted, and Peacham was convicted. He was sentenced to death but allowed to die in prison.\n\nCrewe's  professional reputation was somewhat damaged by the [[Leicester boy]] Witch Trials, where he sat as an extra judge of assize.  Nine women were hanged on the evidence of a young boy called John Smith  whom Crewe, and his colleague Sir [[Humphrey Winch]], found entirely credible, but whom [[James VI of Scotland|King James]] soon after declared to be a fraud.\n\nCrewe was a member of the commission which tried Richard Weston for the murder of Sir [[Thomas Overbury]] in 1615, and was concerned with [[Francis Bacon|Bacon]] and Montague in the prosecution of the [[Robert Carr, 1st Earl of Somerset|Earl]] and [[Frances Carr, Countess of Somerset|Countess]] of Somerset as accessories before the fact  to Overbury's  murder in the following year. In 1621 he conducted the prosecution of [[Henry Yelverton (attorney-general)|Henry Yelverton]], the [[Attorney General for England and Wales|attorney-general]], for certain alleged misdemeanours in connection with patents. The same year Crewe prosecuted Sir [[Francis Mitchell]] for alleged corrupt practices in executing 'the commission concerning gold and silver thread,' conducted the impeachment of [[Sir John Bennet]], judge of the [[Prerogative court]], for corruption in his office, and materially contributed to the settlement of an important point in the law of impeachment. Edward Floyde, having published a libel on the [[Elizabeth of Bohemia|Princess Palatine]], was impeached by the [[British House of Commons|commons]], and sentenced to the pillory. The [[House of Lords|lords]] disputed the right of the [[British House of Commons|commons]] to pass sentence upon the offender on two grounds : (1) that he was not a member of their house ; (2) that the offence did not touch their privileges. At the conference which followed Crewe adduced a precedent from the reign of [[Henry IV of England|Henry IV]] in support of the contention of the [[House of Lords|lords]], and the [[British House of Commons|commons]] being able to produce no counter-precedent the question was quietly settled by the [[British House of Commons|commons]] entering in the journal a minute to the effect that the proceedings against Floyde should not become a precedent. In 1624 Crewe presented part of the case against [[Lionel Cranfield, 1st Earl of Middlesex|Lionel Cranfield, earl of Middlesex]], on his impeachment. The same year he was appointed [[serjeant-at-law|king's serjeant]].\n\n==Lord Chief Justice==\n[[File:Sir Randall Crewe LCJ.jpg|thumb|left|Crewe as Lord Chief Justice]]\nThe following year (26 January 1625) he was created [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales|chief justice of the king's bench]] by King [[James I of England|James I]]. On 9 November 1626, he was removed by [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] for having refused to subscribe a document affirming the legality of forced loans. All his colleagues seem to have concurred with him, but he alone was punished.\n\n===The Oxford peerage case===\nThe Crewe family is said to be among the most ancient in the kingdom, a fact the importance of which is not likely to have been underrated by Sir Ranulph, if we may judge by his eloquent prologue to the [[Earl of Oxford|Oxford]] peerage case, decided 1625, which is one of the few passages of really fine prose to be found in the Law Reports. \"Time\" he said, \"hath his revolutions, and there must be an end to all temporal things, {{lang|la|finis rerum}}\". \"Where,\" he asks, \"is [[Bohun family|Bohun]], where's [[House of Mowbray|Mowbray]], where's [[House of Mortimer|Mortimer]]? Nay, which is more and most of all, where is [[House of Plantagenet|Plantagenet]]? They are entombed in the urns and sepulchres of mortality. And yet let the name and dignity of [[de Vere family|De Vere]] stand so long as it pleaseth God.\"\n\n==Retirement==\nFrom a letter written by him to the [[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham|Duke of Buckingham]] (28 June 1628) it seems that he hoped to receive some compensation through Buckingham's support. On the assassination of Buckingham (24 August 1628) Crewe urged his suit upon the [[Charles I of England|king]] himself, but without success. After the impeachment in 1641 of the judges who had affirmed the legality of [[Ship money]], [[Denzil Holles, 1st Baron Holles|Denzil Holles]] moved the [[House of Lords]] to petition the [[Charles I of England|king]] to compensate Crewe, who seems to have passed the rest of his days in retirement, partly in London, and partly at his seat, Crewe Hall, [[Barthomley]], Cheshire, built by him upon an estate said to have belonged to his ancestors, which he purchased from [[Edward Coke|Coke]] in 1608. Crewe Hall was garrisoned for the parliament, taken by Byron in December 1643, and retaken in the following February. A letter from Crewe to Sir Richard Browne at Paris, under date 10 April 1644, describing the growing exasperation of 'this plus quam civile bellum,' as he called it, and the devastation of the country, is preserved in the British Museum, and is printed in the Fairfax Correspondence. Crewe died at Westminster on 3 January 1645\u20136, and was buried on 5 June in a chapel built by himself at [[Barthomley]].\n\n==Private life==\n[[File:Julia Fasey, Lady Crewe by Peter Lely.jpg|thumb|Crewe's second wife, Julia Fasey ([[Peter Lely]])]]\nHe married twice:\n#on 20 July 1598, Julia, daughter and coheiress of John Clipsby or Clippesby of Clippesby, Norfolk, who died on 29 July 1603 ;\n#on 12 April 1607, Julia, daughter of Edward Fasey of London, relict of Sir Thomas Hesketh, knight, who died on 10 August 1629.

However, Schreibvogel, local volunteers, and Red Oak police were quickly overwhelmed by the task of corralling the large and fast-running birds, several of which died. Schreibvogel and another man resorted to killing emus with shotguns and were accused of animal cruelty by police.  However, since the emus were considered [[livestock]], they could lawfully be killed humanely in Texas, and a [[Grand juries in the United States|grand jury]] declined to indict Schreibvogel.  Most surviving birds ultimately wound up at Texas ranches.<ref name=DMN_3Apr20/>\n\nIn 2000, Schreibvogel acquired his first tigers (two abandoned tigers).<ref name=\":0\" /> To feed his growing zoo of [[big cat]]s, he took in horses that were donated to him.

He adjudicated on nearly a hundred cases in the House of Lords and the Privy Council; his final case before retirement was ''[[Delaware v City of Westminster]]'', in October 2001.\n\n==Legal philosophy and influence on the law==\nCooke is New Zealand's best known jurist, and is regarded as perhaps the finest judge which the country has produced.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Elias|first1=Sian|title=Eulogy for the Lord Cooke of Thorndon|url=https://www.courtsofnz.govt.nz/from/speeches-and-papers/#speechpaper-list-2006|website=Courts of New Zealand|publisher=Supreme Court|accessdate=1 April 2016}}</ref>  He is most widely known for his contribution to the development of [[administrative law]] (both in New Zealand and internationally) and his influence in the development of legal recognition for the [[Treaty of Waitangi]].\n\nCooke was a champion of the need to develop independent jurisprudence for New Zealand. In 1956, having recently returned from the United Kingdom, he criticised New Zealand's judiciary for its \"unquestioning compliance\" with English case law.<ref>Cooke, Robin \"The Supreme Tribunal of the British Commonwealth?\" (1956) 32 NZLJ 233, p 235</ref> By 1988, Lord Cooke was pleased to be able to report that \"in virtually every major field of law New Zealand law is radically, or at least very considerably, different from English law\".<ref>Cooke, Robin \"Fundamentals\" [1988] NZLJ 158, p 158</ref> This change was thanks in part to his own efforts. Yet Lord Cooke did not believe that different jurisdictions had nothing to learn from each other. Rather, he believed that \"[c]ommon denominators may be usefully sought, as long as the process is not compelled from outside and the national ethos is allowed its own weight.\"<ref>Lord Cooke \"The Dream of an International Common Law\" in Cheryl Saunders (ed) ''Courts of Final Jurisdiction: The Mason Court in Australia'' (Federation Press, Sydney, 1996) 136, p 143</ref>\n\n===Administrative law jurisprudence===\nLord Cooke took what could be considered a [[natural law]] approach to public law, often seeking to assert a right for the courts to intervene where none was prescribed in legislation. In ''Fraser v State Services Commission'' he famously made the comment that \"it is arguable that some common law rights may go so deep that even Parliament cannot be accepted by the Courts to have destroyed them.\"<ref>''Fraser v State Services Commission'' [1984] 1 NZLR 116, p 121</ref><ref>And used a very similar phrase in [[Taylor v New Zealand Poultry Board]]</ref> This view contradicted the dominant [[parliamentary supremacy]] theories of [[Albert Venn Dicey|A. V. Dicey]], which had guided common law courts since the late 19th century. However, Cooke's position recalled a similar opinion expressed by the famous 17th century English jurist, [[Sir Edward Coke]].\n\nIn ''Bulk Gas Users Group v Attorney-General'', the then Justice Cooke delivered the leading judgment of the Court of Appeal.<ref>''Bulk Gas Users Group v Attorney-General'' [1983] NZLR 129</ref>  Cooke held that a [[ouster clause|privative clause]] in the Commerce Act 1975 did not prevent the courts from reviewing a decision made by the Secretary of Energy.  He observed that \"the Courts of general jurisdiction will be slow to conclude\" that they are not permitted to rule on a question of law. This reluctance to accept the ouster of the court's jurisdiction was characteristic of Cooke's views on the importance of the courts' role in upholding the rule of law.\n\nHe took a similar approach in 1985, when he delivered the judgment of the Court of Appeal in the case of ''Finnigan v New Zealand Rugby Football Union'' allowing the appeal of lawyers seeking an injunction against the [[New Zealand Rugby Union|NZRFU]]'s proposed tour of South Africa.<ref>''Finnigan v New Zealand Rugby Football Union'' [1985] 2 NZLR 159.</ref>  The proposed tour followed the controversial [[1981 Springbok Tour]], and was cancelled after the High Court re-heard the case in light of the Court of Appeal's judgment.\n\nPerhaps the most famous public law case which Cooke decided came before him when he was President of the [[Court of Appeal of New Zealand|Court of Appeal]]. In ''[[Simpson v Attorney-General]]'' (commonly referred to as ''Baigent's case''), the Court held that it is implicit in the [[New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990]] that breaches of human rights by public officials could result in a claim for [[damages]] \u2014 even though there is no such provision in the Act itself. In the case, the Police had mistakenly carried out a search warrant at the wrong address. Because the occupant of the house was not charged with any crime, there was no obvious remedy for the Police's illegal search (exclusion of improperly obtained evidence being the usual remedy applied in Bill of Rights Act cases). In delivering the leading judgment, President Cooke remarked that \"we [the Court] would fail in our duty if we did not give an effective remedy to a person whose legislatively affirmed rights have been infringed\".\n\n===Treaty of Waitangi jurisprudence===\nIn 1987, Cooke delivered the judgment of the Court of Appeal in the landmark case of [[New Zealand Maori Council v Attorney-General|''New Zealand Maori Council'' v ''Attorney-General'']], which sought to clarify what Parliament meant by section 9 of the State Owned Enterprises Act 1986. The Act stated \"Nothing in this act shall permit the Crown to act in a manner that is inconsistent with the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi\", but what those principles might be was left to the courts to decide.  The [[Treaty of Waitangi#.22Principles of the Treaty.22|principles elicited by President Cooke]] gave legal recognition to the special relationship between the Crown and Maori. Cooke held that \"the Treaty created an enduring relationship of a fiduciary nature akin to a partnership, each party accepting a positive duty to act in good faith, fairly, reasonably and honourably towards the other\". This principle of partnership continues to shape the legal relations between the Crown and Maori to this day.<ref>''Paki v Attorney-General (No 2)'' [2014] NZSC 118, [2015] 1 NZLR 67</ref>\n\n===Legal commentary===\nLord Cooke's often bold views occasionally drew criticism. In one noteworthy example, some of Australia's most senior judges co-wrote the Preface of ''Meagher, Gummow and Lehane\u2019s Equity, Doctrines and Remedies'', where they blamed \"Lord Cooke's misguided endeavours\" for what they saw as the Court of Appeal's unprincipled decisions concerning the merger of common law and [[Equity (law)|equitable]] doctrines in New Zealand. The authors went on to remark \"[t]hat one man could, in a few years, cause such destruction exposes the fragility of contemporary legal systems and the need for vigilant exposure and rooting out of error\".<ref>Preface - Fourth Edition, ''Meager, Gummow and Lehane's Equity, Doctrines and Remedies'', p xi</ref> However, not all their colleagues shared such concerns. [[Michael Kirby (judge)|Justice Kirby]] (of the [[High Court of Australia]]), in his 2008 W A Lee Lecture, noted that Lord Cooke's supposedly \"heretical\" views had in fact been accepted by many prominent jurists in the United Kingdom, including the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Kirby|first1=Michael|title=W A Lee Equity Lecture: Equity's Australian Isolationism|url=http://www.hcourt.gov.au/assets/publications/speeches/former-justices/kirbyj/kirbyj_19nov08.pdf|website=High Court of Australia|accessdate=1 April 2016}}</ref> He took issue with the tone of the ''Meagher'' Preface, remarking that \"those familiar with the successive 'rooting out' of heretics in England under the later Tudors will recognise the ''genre'' of this denunciatory writing. Burning at the professional stake would seem too kind a fate for such doctrinal rascals.\"\n\nCooke himself had a formidable extrajudicial and academic presence. From 1992 until 1996, Cooke was General Editor of ''[[The Laws of New Zealand]]'' and selected the original authors for the different titles.<ref>Sir Robin Cooke, \"Preface\", Introduction, ''The Laws of New Zealand'', Butterworths, Wellington, 1992, p. v.</ref> He was also a prolific contributor to legal journals, including the ''[[Law Quarterly Review]]'', ''[[Cambridge Law Journal]]'' and ''[[New Zealand Law Journal]]''.\n\nIn 1996, Lord Cooke delivered the 47th [[Hamlyn Lectures|Hamlyn Lecture Series]], entitled ''Turning Points of the Common Law''.<ref>{{cite

2006) was a New Zealand judge and later a British [[Lords of Appeal in Ordinary|Law Lord]] and member of the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]].  He is widely considered one of New Zealand's most influential jurists, and is the only New Zealand judge to have sat in the [[House of Lords]]. He was a Non-Permanent Judge of the [[Court of Final Appeal (Hong Kong)|Court of Final Appeal]] of [[Hong Kong]] from 1997 to 2006.<ref>'Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal - Former Judges - The Right Honourable Lord COOKE of Thorndon (Deceased)' <http://www.hkcfa.hk/en/about/who/judges/former/index_id_37.html> accessed 3 June 2016</ref>\n\n==Early life and education==\nThe son of [[High Court of New Zealand|Supreme Court]] Justice Philip Brunskill Cooke {{post-nominals|country=GBR|KC|MC}} and his wife Valmai, Lord Cooke was born in [[Wellington]], and attended [[Wanganui Collegiate School]]. He graduated with a [[Master of Laws|LL.M.]] degree from [[Victoria University of Wellington|Victoria University College]], and subsequently studied at [[Clare College, Cambridge]] as a Research Fellow. While on a travelling scholarship, Lord Cooke was awarded a [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge)|MA]] degree in 1954 from [[Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge|Gonville and Caius College]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] and subsequently a PhD degree in 1955.\n\nIn 1952 he married Annette Miller, with whom he would have three sons.\n\n==Legal career==\nCooke was admitted to the New Zealand bar in 1950, and was also admitted to the English bar as a [[barrister]] of [[Inner Temple]] in 1954. He practised law in New Zealand as a barrister for almost twenty years, and was appointed as a [[List of King's and Queen's Counsel in New Zealand|Queen's Counsel]] in 1964. In 1972 he was appointed as a Judge of the (former) New Zealand Supreme Court (now High Court). He held this position until 1976 when he was elevated to the [[New Zealand Court of Appeal]] (at that time the country's highest local court). In 1986, he was appointed as President of that Court \u2013 a position he was to hold for the next 10 years. On his retirement from the Court of Appeal in 1996 Cook was granted a British [[life peerage]] as [[Baron]] Cooke of [[Thorndon, New Zealand|Thorndon]],<ref name=peerage /> (a suburb of [[Wellington]]) in New Zealand and of [[Cambridge]] in the County of Cambridgeshire,<ref name=seat /> becoming a member of the [[Appellate Committee]] of the House of Lords where he sat as a Lord of Appeal (Law Lord) until his retirement in 2001. He also sat (from time to time) as President in the Courts of Appeal of [[Samoa]], the [[Cook Islands]] and [[Kiribati]]; as well as being a Non-Permanent Judge on the [[Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal]] and a Judge of the [[Supreme Court of Fiji]].\n\nCooke was the only [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] judge in the past century to sit in the Appellate Committee of the House of Lords on United Kingdom appeals.

[[Michael Kirby (judge)|Justice Kirby]] (of the [[High Court of Australia]]), in his 2008 W A Lee Lecture, noted that Lord Cooke's supposedly \"heretical\" views had in fact been accepted by many prominent jurists in the United Kingdom, including the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Kirby|first1=Michael|title=W A Lee Equity Lecture: Equity's Australian Isolationism|url=http://www.hcourt.gov.au/assets/publications/speeches/former-justices/kirbyj/kirbyj_19nov08.pdf|website=High Court of Australia|accessdate=1 April 2016}}</ref> He took issue with the tone of the ''Meagher'' Preface, remarking that \"those familiar with the successive 'rooting out' of heretics in England under the later Tudors will recognise the ''genre'' of this denunciatory writing. Burning at the professional stake would seem too kind a fate for such doctrinal rascals.\"\n\nCooke himself had a formidable extrajudicial and academic presence. From 1992 until 1996, Cooke was General Editor of ''[[The Laws of New Zealand]]'' and selected the original authors for the different titles.<ref>Sir Robin Cooke, \"Preface\", Introduction, ''The Laws of New Zealand'', Butterworths, Wellington, 1992, p. v.</ref> He was also a prolific contributor to legal journals, including the ''[[Law Quarterly Review]]'', ''[[Cambridge Law Journal]]'' and ''[[New Zealand Law Journal]]''.\n\nIn 1996, Lord Cooke delivered the 47th [[Hamlyn Lectures|Hamlyn Lecture Series]], entitled ''Turning Points of the Common Law''.<ref>{{cite

Colin Gillies.\nHe was born on 18 May 1813. \nHis elder brother, Peter Blackburn, represented Stirlingshire in the conservative interest in the parliament of 1859\u201365. \nHis younger brother was the mathematician [[Hugh Blackburn]]. {{sfn|Rigg|1901}}\nThe future judge was educated at [[Eton College|Eton]] and [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], in which university he graduated B.A. (eighth wrangler) in 1835, and proceeded M.A. in 1838.<ref>{{acad|id=BLKN831C|name=Blackburn, Colin}}</ref> \nIn 1870, he received the honorary degree of LL.D. from the University of Edinburgh. \nAdmitted on 20 April 1835, student at [[Lincoln's Inn]], he migrated thence to the [[Inner Temple]], where he was called to the bar on 23 November 1838, and elected honorary bencher on 13 April 1877. {{sfn|Rigg|1901}}\n \nFor some years after his call, he went the northern circuit in a briefless or almost briefless condition. He had no professional connection, no turn for politics, no political interest, none of the advantages of person and address which make for success in advocacy, and though his well-earned repute as a legal author led to his occasional employment in weighty mercantile cases, he was still a stuff gownsman, and better known in the courts as a reporter than as a pleader, when on the transference of Sir [[William Erle]] from the [[Queen's Bench]] to the chief-justiceship of the common pleas, [[John Campbell, 1st Baron Campbell|Lord Campbell]] startled the profession by selecting him for the vacant [[Puisne Justice|puisne judgeship]]. \nHe was appointed justice on 27 June 1859, and on 2 November following, was invested with the coif.

He was author of a masterly ''Treatise on the Effect of the Contract of Sale on the Legal Rights of Property and Possession in Goods. Wares, and Merchandise,'' London, 1845, 8vo, which held its own as the standard text-book on the subject until displaced by the more comprehensive work of Benjamin. A new edition, revised by [[J. C.

As a reporter Blackburn collaborated with [[Thomas Flower Ellis]]. {{sfn|Rigg|1901}}\n\nThough greatly respected he does not seem to have been popular; according to a well-known story he informed a colleague that he intended to retire in vacation to avoid the trouble of a retirement dinner \u2014 the colleague cheerfully replied that this was quite unnecessary since no-one would have turned up to the dinner anyway.<ref>Sir John Hollam  ''Jottings of an Old Solicitor'' London 1906</ref>\n\nHe was the author of a valuable work on the ''Law of Sales'' <ref>'[[The Times]]'', 10 January 1896; E Manson, ''Builders of our Law'' (1904).</ref>\n\n==Judgements==\n[[File:Colin Blackburn, Vanity Fair, 1881-11-19.jpg|thumb|\"a lord of appeal\".

He was author of a masterly ''Treatise on the Effect of the Contract of Sale on the Legal Rights of Property and Possession in Goods. Wares, and Merchandise,'' London, 1845, 8vo, which held its own as the standard text-book on the subject until displaced by the more comprehensive work of Benjamin. A new edition, revised by [[J. C. Graham]], appeared in 1885. As a reporter Blackburn collaborated with [[Thomas Flower Ellis]]. {{sfn|Rigg|1901}}\n\nThough greatly respected he does not seem to have been popular; according to a well-known story he informed a colleague that he intended to retire in vacation to avoid the trouble of a retirement dinner \u2014 the colleague cheerfully replied that this was quite unnecessary since no-one would have turned up to the dinner anyway.<ref>Sir John Hollam  ''Jottings of an Old Solicitor'' London 1906</ref>\n\nHe was the author of a valuable work on the ''Law of Sales'' <ref>'[[The Times]]'', 10 January 1896; E Manson, ''Builders of our Law'' (1904).</ref>\n\n==Judgements==\n[[File:Colin Blackburn, Vanity Fair, 1881-11-19.jpg|thumb|\"a lord of appeal\".
