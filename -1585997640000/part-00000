A section of the copula density function was taken along the line u=v, and c( u, u; \u03c4 ) plotted for different values of \u03c4. The following plots illustrate c( u, u; \u03c4 ) against u and \u03c4, using expressions in TABLE 2. Note that the tie up with the autocorrelation as given in TABLE 3 for asymptotic values of u, is clearly visible on the plots for the higher values of u (while the uv plane exists for u,v \u0454 (0, 1), the line u=v extends to <math>\\sqrt2</math> = 1.414 ).\n\n'''FIGURE''' '''1''' '''(a-d)''' shows plots of the sections of the copula density functions c( u, u; \u03c4 ) against different values of u and \u03c4 \u0454 (0, 5), using expressions given in TABLE 2. Figure 1 (a) and 1 (b) represent the plot for a Gaussian stochastic processes with correlation functions  \u03c1( \u03c4 ) = exp( 0.1 \u03c4 ) , and \u03c1( \u03c4 ) = exp( 0.1 \u03c4 ) . cos<sup>2</sup>( \u03c0 0.9 \u03c4 ), respectively; while figures 1 (c) and 1(d) represents the plot for a Exponentially distributed stochastic process with correlation functions \u03c1( \u03c4 ) = exp( 0.1 \u03c4 ) , and \u03c1( \u03c4 ) = exp( 0.1 \u03c4 ) . cos<sup>2</sup>( \u03c0 0.9 \u03c4 ), respectively.\n\nFrom the above figures it may be observed that for large values of u, c( u, u; \u03c4 ) reflects the two different autocorrelation functions \u03c1( \u03c4 ) very distinctively as noted by the curves along the xz axis. These graphs verify the results given in TABLE 3.\n[[File:CopulaFigure2.png|thumb|300x300px|Figure 2: Plots of section along the symmetry line for copula density functions of simulated Gaussian stochastic process with embedded autocorrelation functions.|alt=]]\n\nTo reinforce these results, 50,000 data points of a Gaussian second order stationary time series were simulated with specified autocorrelations, and the copulas density functions c( u, v; \u03c4 ) were computed. Their values were plotted within a (+0.05, -0.05) band around u=v, for different values of \u03c4, and the following results were obtained. Two separate autocorrelation values were chosen,\n\n(i) \u03c1( \u03c4 ) = exp( -\u03b1 \u03c4 )\n\n(ii) \u03c1( \u03c4 ) = exp( -\u03b1 \u03c4 ) . cos<sup>2</sup>( \u03c0 f \u03c4 )\n\nand the results superimposed to illustrate that the correlations are embedded in the copula density functions. The superposition of the results on the same graph are all the more effective, as the envelope of the second correlation is the same as the first correlation, and the results are immediately evident, thus verifying the theoretical expressions included in TABLE 3.\n\n'''FIGURE''' '''2''' shows section along the u=v line for copula density functions of Simulated Gaussian Stochastic process with autocorrelations in \u03c1( \u03c4 ) = exp( 0.1 \u03c4 ) , and \u03c1( \u03c4 ) = exp( -\u03b1 \u03c4 ) . cos<sup>2</sup>( \u03c0 0.9 \u03c4 ), respectively.\n\n== Advance applications of copula in medical imaging ==\nConsidering image as a two-dimensional signal, please refer to these article for further reading on advanced applications of copula in medical imaging <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/search/searchresult.jsp?newsearch=true&queryText=copula|title=IEEE|last=|first=|date=|website=IEEE|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Probabilistic models]]\n", "name_user": "Earthianyogi", "label": "safe", "comment": "reference correction", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copula_in_Signal_Processing"}

Most of these games were commercially released long after the end of the console's official life span in North America where production was seized by end of 2001, although Sega of America still offered support and had some games scheduled for release (but was the division at Sega who released the fewest titles after 2002, pretty much limited to ''[[NFL 2K2]]'' and other games in the 2K genre) and so games kept being released for quite some time still after first announcing the move to [[Third party developer|3rd party Development]], unlike 1st party titles of other regions like ''[[Puyo Pop Fever|Puyo Puyo Fever]]'' being released in 2004 in Japan and a select few more in Europe, seeing as the Dreamcast was launched approximately 1.5 years later in Europe compared to Japan and 13 months later than North America, thus the last region the console was released in at 20th of October of 2000. Meanwhile, in Japan, the console was released in November of 1998, lasting with official support and console sales as well as hardware peripherals and games both developed and published by studios at[[Sega of Japan]], from 1998 through 2007, almost giving the [[Sixth generation of video game consoles|6th generation console]] 10 years of official support in the region.    \n\nIn comparison, the [[Xbox 360]] had already been launched when Sega still was publishing games for the Dreamcast (and other platforms) in Japan.    \n\nHowever, most of the time, the online [[Dreamcast game library|Sega Direct store]] was the only place to find new consoles which had been produced recently, often with special color variations such as Black and other limited edition collector items, and after the last official released title published by Sega of Japan, ''[[Karous]]'' (2007) hit store shelves, indie developers poured the console with commercially available games from all over the world, often with very tight time frames between each release generally, making the console in some ways, matter again well into the [[Seventh generation of video game consoles|7th generation of consoles]].    \n\nConsequently, these games are unlicensed by [[Sega]], [[Sega|although completely legal]] if created with a [[development environment]] which is not licensed by Sega as the games are not published by Sega, which always is mentioned during the license boot screen if they are, but which can be modified in the disc's [[Bin cue|IP. BIN]] to state that the software is NOT. All of these independent releases makes Dreamcast's titles that is still receiving 9 new game titles by 2020 already announced, thus making it more common than most release schedules since 2001 in at least North America.{{clarify|date=March 2020}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thedreamcastjunkyard.co.uk/2020/01/new-dreamcast-games-coming-in-2020.html|title=New Dreamcast Games Coming In 2020|last=Charnock|first=Tom|access-date=2020-03-04}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2018/01/14/sega-dreamcast-saturn-genesis-accessories/|title=Retro-bit brought brand-new Sega accessories to CES|website=Engadget|language=en|access-date=2020-03-04}}</ref> \n\n[[IGN]] reopened their Dreamcast section in 2006<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IGN|title=Wiki - IGN|last=Wiki|first=Pedia|date=30 March 2006|website=Wikipedia|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=4 March 2020}}</ref> as Sega was publishing games like ''[[Under Defeat]]'' in 2005.   \n\nThe Dreamcast's unlicenced games are produced and printed on regular [[compact disc]]s (CD) using the [[MIL-CD|Mil-CD]] format created in-house by Sega, which is just a normal CD unlike its native games format, the [[GD-ROM]], aimed at karaoke and interactive content on regular CDs in general. Unlike the GD-ROMs though, which can hold up to 1.2GB of data, a CD-ROM can hold around 50% of that, and it would not be legal to develop games on a proprietary storage medium without permission or a license, and so to release independent titles for the Dreamcast legally, even selling them at retailers<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.play-asia.com/another-world-hd/13/70bx63|title=Another World HD|website=Playasia|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-05}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://videogamesnewyork.com/flashback-quest-for-identity-sega-dreamcast/|title=FlashBack: Quest for Identity (Sega Dreamcast)|website=Videogamesnewyork|language=en|access-date=2020-03-05}}</ref>, which is what differs most Dreamcast releases of today with 'homebrew' by definition, as the Dreamcast does not require modifications of any sort <ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.techopedia.com/definition/10649/homebrew|title=What is Homebrew? - Definition from Techopedia|website=Techopedia.com|language=en|access-date=2020-03-05}}</ref> as opposed to consoles requiring mod chips or other user-made modifications using a proprietary piece of software and or hardware like the original [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] and its sequel, the Xbox 360, and that the Dreamcast titles state during the boot-up of the game that it is not published nor licensed by Sega, which all modern releases for the Dreamcast as of 2020 since 2004 has been doing to be able to sell them at retailers. Josh Prod among a few of the most serious and active studios, publishing exceptionally many high-quality titles after buying the right to have them ported, often by the studio owning those right also developing or porting them, which will boot on any Dreamcast, only some consoles manufactured between up until 2007 where Sega removed the MIL-CD support from the BIOS; console manufacturing in Japan was restarted to meet demand although no official numbers exist, probably in limited or few print runs but either way was selling new consoles and hardware through all of 2007. However, removing the [[MIL-CD]] compatible code in the [[BIOS]], which since has been dumped and is of version 1.022; the last one to have been found so far, prevents owners of these consoles from playing games released on CD-Roms. While the last officially Sega published game was released, titled ''[[Karous]]'', on the 3rd of March in 2007, which also has seen an unofficially translated version (ie actual 'homebrew') was made and released online in 2019, while a lot more titles were consistently released in Japan up until that point. ''[[Triggerheart Exelica|Trigger Heart Exelica]]'' was one of them, along with ''[[Under Defeat]] (''2005), ''[[Puyo Pop Fever|Puyo Puyo Fever]]'' (2004) to name a few. However, those owning a console with the latest BIOS version, does not have the ability to out of the box, but have to replace their GD-ROM drive with an optical drive emulator, solder in a new or additional BIOS ROM chip to have the ability to boot up a game released on CD-ROM, like the upcoming ''[[Arcade Racing Legend]]''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.obscuregamers.com/threads/new-indie-dreamcast-3d-racing-game-by-joshprod-called-arcade-racing-legends-has-a-playable-demo-out-and-kickstarter-is-live.607/|title=Dreamcast - New Indie Dreamcast 3D Racing game by JoshProd called Arcade Racing Legends has a playable demo out and kickstarter is live|website=ObscureGamers - Prototopia|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-05}}</ref> by Josh Prod due for release in 2020 after a [[Kickstarter]] campaign.   \n\nReleasing games on half the size of the native format, however, can be a problem, depending on the game. Copies of games from [[Giga (disambiguation)|GDs]] through Dreamshell to an SD-card or through the official broadband adapter, subsequently burnt to a blank CD, will results, or rather, can result in having to remove content which is often the case to make them fit on standard CDs, which depending on region can even be a felony. Thus making the independently released titles for Dreamcast which can be bought at most retailers, different from homebrew in that a completely stock console, will most likely boot the game, as with ''[[GameShark|Gameshark]]'', ''[[Action Replay]]'', ''[[Codebreaker (video game)|CodeBreaker]]'' and ''[[Bleemcast]]'' to name a few. The Japanese consoles not supporting MIL-CD will often tell you (in Japanese) on one side of the outer box.    \n\nThe reason for releasing games on CDs instead of the native format is mostly because the GD-ROM format is no longer marketed by Sega, thus difficult to get a hold of, nor did it ever have a commercially available blank counterpart and would have made independent titles such those published by IP owner and publishing studio known as JoshProd<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thedreamcastjunkyard.co.uk/2018/01/2018-dreamcast-releases-teased-by.html|title=2018 Dreamcast Releases Teased By JoshProd|last=Charnock|first=Tom|access-date=2020-03-04}}</ref> which is by far the company with most independent titles released so far[https://m.facebook.com/joshprod/].     \n\nAnother reason is that there is actual copy protection in place which has yet to be defeated without using the rare 'System Disc 2' - a disc by Sega for developers that unlocks the protection, making it possible to boot games burnt on GD-R discs, the blank GD-ROM equivalent to blank CD-R discs.   \n\nGames are mostly released in standard CD or [[DVD]] jewel cases, or more recently, styled as a retail Dreamcast case depending on region (where Japan had what may look like a DVD case). The regional style of the cases is a purely cosmetic option, because all independent titles released on [[CD-ROM]] are [[region-free]] as [[MIL-CD|Mil-CDs]] in general cannot be region locked, while GD-Rom based games indeed are, requiring one of many commercially released boot discs like the GameShark, CodeBreaker and others, which enable all regions to boot. Problems may arise when using this method because of PAL games on games where no option of 60Hz is available in most of all PAL games released, being the first console to support PAL60 video output<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/PAL_region|title=PAL region - Wikipedia|website=en.m.wikipedia.org|language=en|access-date=2020-03-05}}</ref> but which is implemented on a per-game basis as the Dreamcast itself does not contain an operating system, thus making games from regions other than PAL, which always run at 60Hz, making the game not run at its intended full speed and may feature horizontal borders around the screen. The PS2 is notorious for not having many 60Hz games in PAL regions. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/PAL_region|title=PAL region - Wikipedia|website=en.m.wikipedia.org|language=en|access-date=2020-03-05}}</ref>  \n\nMost of the games currently in development and most of the many recently released, have all been developed using the open source and free [[Software development kit|SDK]] known as [[KallistiOS]], or an equally legal alternative, providing about the same functionality as Sega's own SDK [[Video game developer|developers]] have claimed, stating the Dreamcast is very developer friendly,<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/2013/8/7/4599588/why-did-the-dreamcast-fail-segas-marketing-veteran-looks-back|title=Why did the Dreamcast fail?

It is, however, starting to gain a cult following, as the system is becoming harder to find. In fact, although Dreamcast was officially discontinued in January 2001, Sega continued to produce the console for a short time afterward due to rising demand in Japan, especially among collectors and hardcore fans. \n\nIn 2007, the same year Sega officially published the last official game for the Dreamcast, titled ''[[Karous]]''; released in the spring, made a profit from Consumer hardware products, with a profit margin of over 1000 million Japanese Yen\u00a5<ref name=\":0\" /> <ref name=\":0\" />the [[PlayStation 2|PS2]] - which on the contrary, needs modifications to run indie games or unlicensed code, which means making software for the PS2 actual homebrew, correct, while with the Dreamcast - does not require anything to be done to boot released games, thus making the phrase homebrew, incorrect according to dictionaries as well as the underlying meaning of the word, implying at least somewhat the implication of illegal activities. <ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\"Gamasutra: Dream Alive p1\" />\n\nSo the restart of console and hardware production although at very limited runs<ref name=\":2\" />atleast made profit at one point, that is, in the year of 2007, when Sega made over 1000 million \u00a5 in profit<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\"Gamasutra: Dream Alive p1\" /> and has now partnered with Retro-bit to create new wireless controllers as well as new, cabled ones, already in store shelves as of March 2020, while its whole library of online games brought back thanks to the Dcserv-project probably also had an impact, as few other consoles have had the same happen. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171109025102/http://www.dreamcastlive.net/blogs/post/Alien-Front-Online-Resurrected/|title=Dreamcast Live - Alien Front Online Resurrected!|date=2017-11-09|website=web.archive.org|access-date=2020-03-04}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170613170046/http://www.dreamcastlive.net/blogs/post/Interview-with-Petter3k-of-DCSERV/|title=Dreamcast Live - Interview with Petter3k of DCSERV|date=2017-06-13|website=web.archive.org|access-date=2020-03-04}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thedreamcastjunkyard.co.uk/2014/12/toy-racer-dial-up-connection-in-works.html|title=Toy Racer Dial-Up Connection In The Works|last=Charnock|first=Tom|access-date=2020-03-04}}</ref>\n\nNevertheless, the games for Dreamcast in store shelves as of today and the years after 2007-2008 - 2020 are far from 'homebrew' and what has been released since 2007 are nothing more or less than indie productions from smaller sized studios for other platforms and are often multi-platform releases by serious companies. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141204232812/http://www.edge-online.com/news/death-dreamcast-official/|title=Death of the Dreamcast Official - Edge Online|date=2014-12-04|website=web.archive.org|access-date=2020-03-05}}</ref> \n\nWhile in North America, production ended already by the year 2001, shipments of consoles to Europe however, continued well into 2003 and even 2004.

Most of these games were commercially released long after the end of the console's official life span in North America where production was seized by end of 2001, although Sega of America still offered support and had some games scheduled for release (but was the division at Sega who released the fewest titles after 2002, pretty much limited to ''[[NFL 2K2]]'' and other games in the 2K genre) and so games kept being released for quite some time still after first announcing the move to [[Third party developer|3rd party Development]], unlike 1st party titles of other regions like ''[[Puyo Pop Fever|Puyo Puyo Fever]]'' being released in 2004 in Japan and a select few more in Europe, seeing as the Dreamcast was launched approximately 1.5 years later in Europe compared to Japan and 13 months later than North America, thus the last region the console was released in at 20th of October of 2000. Meanwhile, in Japan, the console was released in November of 1998, lasting with official support and console sales as well as hardware peripherals and games both developed and published by studios at[[Sega of Japan]], from 1998 through 2007, almost giving the [[Sixth generation of video game consoles|6th generation console]] 10 years of official support in the region.    \n\nIn comparison, the [[Xbox 360]] had already been launched when Sega still was publishing games for the Dreamcast (and other platforms) in Japan.    \n\nHowever, most of the time, the online [[Dreamcast game library|Sega Direct store]] was the only place to find new consoles which had been produced recently, often with special color variations such as Black and other limited edition collector items, and after the last official released title published by Sega of Japan, ''[[Karous]]'' (2007) hit store shelves, indie developers poured the console with commercially available games from all over the world, often with very tight time frames between each release generally, making the console in some ways, matter again well into the [[Seventh generation of video game consoles|7th generation of consoles]].    \n\nConsequently, these games are unlicensed by [[Sega]], [[Sega|although completely legal]] if created with a [[development environment]] which is not licensed by Sega as the games are not published by Sega, which always is mentioned during the license boot screen if they are, but which can be modified in the disc's [[Bin cue|IP. BIN]] to state that the software is NOT. All of these independent releases makes Dreamcast's titles that is still receiving 9 new game titles by 2020 already announced, thus making it more common than most release schedules since 2001 in at least North America.{{clarify|date=March 2020}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thedreamcastjunkyard.co.uk/2020/01/new-dreamcast-games-coming-in-2020.html|title=New Dreamcast Games Coming In 2020|last=Charnock|first=Tom|access-date=2020-03-04}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2018/01/14/sega-dreamcast-saturn-genesis-accessories/|title=Retro-bit brought brand-new Sega accessories to CES|website=Engadget|language=en|access-date=2020-03-04}}</ref> \n\n[[IGN]] reopened their Dreamcast section in 2006<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IGN|title=Wiki - IGN|last=Wiki|first=Pedia|date=30 March 2006|website=Wikipedia|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=4 March 2020}}</ref> as Sega was publishing games like ''[[Under Defeat]]'' in 2005.   \n\nThe Dreamcast's unlicenced games are produced and printed on regular [[compact disc]]s (CD) using the [[MIL-CD|Mil-CD]] format created in-house by Sega, which is just a normal CD unlike its native games format, the [[GD-ROM]], aimed at karaoke and interactive content on regular CDs in general. Unlike the GD-ROMs though, which can hold up to 1.2GB of data, a CD-ROM can hold around 50% of that, and it would not be legal to develop games on a proprietary storage medium without permission or a license, and so to release independent titles for the Dreamcast legally, even selling them at retailers<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.play-asia.com/another-world-hd/13/70bx63|title=Another World HD|website=Playasia|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-05}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://videogamesnewyork.com/flashback-quest-for-identity-sega-dreamcast/|title=FlashBack: Quest for Identity (Sega Dreamcast)|website=Videogamesnewyork|language=en|access-date=2020-03-05}}</ref>, which is what differs most Dreamcast releases of today with 'homebrew' by definition, as the Dreamcast does not require modifications of any sort <ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.techopedia.com/definition/10649/homebrew|title=What is Homebrew? - Definition from Techopedia|website=Techopedia.com|language=en|access-date=2020-03-05}}</ref> as opposed to consoles requiring mod chips or other user-made modifications using a proprietary piece of software and or hardware like the original [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] and its sequel, the Xbox 360, and that the Dreamcast titles state during the boot-up of the game that it is not published nor licensed by Sega, which all modern releases for the Dreamcast as of 2020 since 2004 has been doing to be able to sell them at retailers. Josh Prod among a few of the most serious and active studios, publishing exceptionally many high-quality titles after buying the right to have them ported, often by the studio owning those right also developing or porting them, which will boot on any Dreamcast, only some consoles manufactured between up until 2007 where Sega removed the MIL-CD support from the BIOS; console manufacturing in Japan was restarted to meet demand although no official numbers exist, probably in limited or few print runs but either way was selling new consoles and hardware through all of 2007. However, removing the [[MIL-CD]] compatible code in the [[BIOS]], which since has been dumped and is of version 1.022; the last one to have been found so far, prevents owners of these consoles from playing games released on CD-Roms. While the last officially Sega published game was released, titled ''[[Karous]]'', on the 3rd of March in 2007, which also has seen an unofficially translated version (ie actual 'homebrew') was made and released online in 2019, while a lot more titles were consistently released in Japan up until that point. ''[[Triggerheart Exelica|Trigger Heart Exelica]]'' was one of them, along with ''[[Under Defeat]] (''2005), ''[[Puyo Pop Fever|Puyo Puyo Fever]]'' (2004) to name a few. However, those owning a console with the latest BIOS version, does not have the ability to out of the box, but have to replace their GD-ROM drive with an optical drive emulator, solder in a new or additional BIOS ROM chip to have the ability to boot up a game released on CD-ROM, like the upcoming ''[[Arcade Racing Legend]]''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.obscuregamers.com/threads/new-indie-dreamcast-3d-racing-game-by-joshprod-called-arcade-racing-legends-has-a-playable-demo-out-and-kickstarter-is-live.607/|title=Dreamcast - New Indie Dreamcast 3D Racing game by JoshProd called Arcade Racing Legends has a playable demo out and kickstarter is live|website=ObscureGamers - Prototopia|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-05}}</ref> by Josh Prod due for release in 2020 after a [[Kickstarter]] campaign.   \n\nReleasing games on half the size of the native format, however, can be a problem, depending on the game. Copies of games from [[Giga (disambiguation)|GDs]] through Dreamshell to an SD-card or through the official broadband adapter, subsequently burnt to a blank CD, will results, or rather, can result in having to remove content which is often the case to make them fit on standard CDs, which depending on region can even be a felony. Thus making the independently released titles for Dreamcast which can be bought at most retailers, different from homebrew in that a completely stock console, will most likely boot the game, as with ''[[GameShark|Gameshark]]'', ''[[Action Replay]]'', ''[[Codebreaker (video game)|CodeBreaker]]'' and ''[[Bleemcast]]'' to name a few. The Japanese consoles not supporting MIL-CD will often tell you (in Japanese) on one side of the outer box.    \n\nThe reason for releasing games on CDs instead of the native format is mostly because the GD-ROM format is no longer marketed by Sega, thus difficult to get a hold of, nor did it ever have a commercially available blank counterpart and would have made independent titles such those published by IP owner and publishing studio known as JoshProd<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thedreamcastjunkyard.co.uk/2018/01/2018-dreamcast-releases-teased-by.html|title=2018 Dreamcast Releases Teased By JoshProd|last=Charnock|first=Tom|access-date=2020-03-04}}</ref> which is by far the company with most independent titles released so far[https://m.facebook.com/joshprod/].     \n\nAnother reason is that there is actual copy protection in place which has yet to be defeated without using the rare 'System Disc 2' - a disc by Sega for developers that unlocks the protection, making it possible to boot games burnt on GD-R discs, the blank GD-ROM equivalent to blank CD-R discs.   \n\nGames are mostly released in standard CD or [[DVD]] jewel cases, or more recently, styled as a retail Dreamcast case depending on region (where Japan had what may look like a DVD case). The regional style of the cases is a purely cosmetic option, because all independent titles released on [[CD-ROM]] are [[region-free]] as [[MIL-CD|Mil-CDs]] in general cannot be region locked, while GD-Rom based games indeed are, requiring one of many commercially released boot discs like the GameShark, CodeBreaker and others, which enable all regions to boot.

It is, however, starting to gain a cult following, as the system is becoming harder to find. In fact, although Dreamcast was officially discontinued in January 2001, Sega continued to produce the console for a short time afterward due to rising demand in Japan, especially among collectors and hardcore fans. \n\nIn 2007, the same year Sega officially published the last official game for the Dreamcast, titled ''[[Karous]]''; released in the spring, made a profit from Consumer hardware products, with a profit margin of over 1000 million Japanese Yen\u00a5<ref name=\":0\" /> <ref name=\":0\" />the [[PlayStation 2|PS2]] - which on the contrary, needs modifications to run indie games or unlicensed code, which means making software for the PS2 actual homebrew, correct, while with the Dreamcast - does not require anything to be done to boot released games, thus making the phrase homebrew, incorrect according to dictionaries as well as the underlying meaning of the word, implying at least somewhat the implication of illegal activities. <ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\"Gamasutra: Dream Alive p1\" />\n\nSo the restart of console and hardware production although at very limited runs<ref name=\":2\" />atleast made profit at one point, that is, in the year of 2007, when Sega made over 1000 million \u00a5 in profit<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\"Gamasutra: Dream Alive p1\" /> and has now partnered with Retro-bit to create new wireless controllers as well as new, cabled ones, already in store shelves as of March 2020, while its whole library of online games brought back thanks to the Dcserv-project probably also had an impact, as few other consoles have had the same happen. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171109025102/http://www.dreamcastlive.net/blogs/post/Alien-Front-Online-Resurrected/|title=Dreamcast Live - Alien Front Online Resurrected!|date=2017-11-09|website=web.archive.org|access-date=2020-03-04}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170613170046/http://www.dreamcastlive.net/blogs/post/Interview-with-Petter3k-of-DCSERV/|title=Dreamcast Live - Interview with Petter3k of DCSERV|date=2017-06-13|website=web.archive.org|access-date=2020-03-04}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thedreamcastjunkyard.co.uk/2014/12/toy-racer-dial-up-connection-in-works.html|title=Toy Racer Dial-Up Connection In The Works|last=Charnock|first=Tom|access-date=2020-03-04}}</ref>\n\nNevertheless, the games for Dreamcast in store shelves as of today and the years after 2007-2008 - 2020 are far from 'homebrew' and what has been released since 2007 are nothing more or less than indie productions from smaller sized studios for other platforms and are often multi-platform releases by serious companies. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141204232812/http://www.edge-online.com/news/death-dreamcast-official/|title=Death of the Dreamcast Official - Edge Online|date=2014-12-04|website=web.archive.org|access-date=2020-03-05}}</ref> \n\nWhile in North America, production ended already by the year 2001, shipments of consoles to Europe however, continued well into 2003 and even 2004.

It follows the ''[[Big Brother (TV series)|Big Brother]]'' format, which was first developed by [[Endemol]] in the Netherlands. Over thirteen years, ''Bigg Boss'' has rolled out thirteen seasons and one spin-off version.\n\n==Overview==\n\n===Concept===\n''Bigg Boss'' is a reality show based on the original [[Big Brother (Netherlands)|Dutch ''Big Brother'']] format developed by [[John de Mol]]. A number of contestants (known as \"housemates\") live in a [[bespoke|purpose-built]] house and are isolated from the rest of the world. Each week, housemates nominate two of their peers for [[eviction]], and the housemates who receives the most nominations would face a public [[vote]]. Of these, one would eventually leave, having been \"evicted\" from the House. However, there were exceptions to this process as dictated by ''Bigg Boss''. In the final week, there were three housemates remaining, and the public voted for who they wanted to win. The housemates in the Indian version are primarily celebrities with the exception of one who is a non-celebrity selected via auditions. Housemates are overseen by a mysterious person known as 'Bigg Boss', whose only presence in the house is through his voice.<ref name=\"bb\">{{cite web |title=Bigg Boss |url=http://endemol.co.in/what-we-do/non-fiction/big-boss/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100728225652/http://endemol.co.in/what-we-do/non-fiction/big-boss/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=28 July 2010 |publisher=Endemol |accessdate=20 December 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===The house===\nA ''Bigg Boss'' House is built for every season. The house was earlier located in the tourist place of [[Lonavla]], [[Pune]] district of [[Maharashtra]], however the house for the fifth season was located [[ND Studios, Karjat|ND Studios]] in [[Karjat]].<ref>{{cite web | title = What the Bigg Boss house is going to be like this season|work= Rediff.com Movies | url = http://www.rediff.com/movies/slide-show/slide-show-1-what-the-bigg-boss-house-is-going-to-be-like/20110930.htm |date=30 September 2011| accessdate = 2014-09-03 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = Shweta gets b'day {{sic|nolink=y|suprise}} on Bigg Boss|work=MiD DAY| url = http://www.mid-day.com/articles/shweta-gets-bday-suprise-on-bigg-boss/97131 |date=5 Oct 2010| accessdate = 2014-09-03 }}</ref> The house is well-furnished and decorated. It has all kinds of modern amenities, but just one or two bedrooms and four toilet bath rooms. There is a garden, pool, activity area and gym in the House. There is also a Confession Room, where the housemates may be called in by ''Bigg Boss'' for any kind of conversation, and for the nomination process.<ref name=\"rediff\">{{cite web|title=What really goes on in Bigg Boss house?|url=http://movies.rediff.com/slide-show/2009/oct/08/slide-show-1-sneak-peek-into-bigg-boss-house.htm|publisher=[[Rediff]]|accessdate=20 December 2010|author=Rajul Hegde|date=8 October 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe House has no TV connection, no telephones, no Internet connection, clocks, pen or paper.<ref name=\"bb\"/>\n\n===Rules===\nWhile all the rules have never been told to the audience, the most prominent ones are clearly seen. The inmates are not permitted to talk in any other language than [[Hindi]]. They are not supposed to tamper with any of the electronic equipment or any other thing in the House.

It follows the ''[[Big Brother (TV series)|Big Brother]]'' format, which was first developed by [[Endemol]] in the Netherlands. Over thirteen years, ''Bigg Boss'' has rolled out thirteen seasons and one spin-off version.\n\n==Overview==\n\n===Concept===\n''Bigg Boss'' is a reality show based on the original [[Big Brother (Netherlands)|Dutch ''Big Brother'']] format developed by [[John de Mol]]. A number of contestants (known as \"housemates\") live in a [[bespoke|purpose-built]] house and are isolated from the rest of the world. Each week, housemates nominate two of their peers for [[eviction]], and the housemates who receives the most nominations would face a public [[vote]]. Of these, one would eventually leave, having been \"evicted\" from the House. However, there were exceptions to this process as dictated by ''Bigg Boss''.

First, researchers aim to build a whole virus vaccine. The use of such a virus, be it [[inactivated vaccine|inactive]] or dead, aims to elicit a prompt [[immune response]] of the human body to a new infection with COVID-19. A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitises the immune system to certain subunits of the virus. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on the S-spike protein that helps the virus intrude the [[ACE2 enzyme]] receptor. A third strategy is that of the nucleic acid vaccines ([[DNA vaccination|DNA]] or [[RNA vaccines]], a novel technique for creating a vaccination). Experimental vaccines from any of these strategies would have to be tested for safety and efficacy.<ref name=\"Chen Strych Hotez Bottazzi p.\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Chen WH, Strych U, Hotez PJ, Bottazzi ME | title=The SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine Pipeline: an Overview | journal=Current Tropical Medicine Reports | date=3 March 2020 | pages=1\u20134 |doi=10.1007/s40475-020-00201-6 |doi-access=free | pmid=32219057 | pmc=7094941 | name-list-format = vanc}}</ref>\n\nOn 16 March 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine started with four volunteers in [[Seattle]].

Guildford's [[wikt:electorate|electorate]] was the largest of the county and this aimed to reduce it. Two wards split between the two constituencies: [[Bramley, Surrey|Bramley]]; and [[Busbridge]] and [[Hascombe]], afterwards entirely in South West Surrey; and the ward '[[Alfold]], [[Cranleigh]] Rural and Ellens Green' was split, so it was consolidated into Guildford for the 2010 general election. The net effect was to increase the number of voters in South West Surrey and reduce the number in Guildford.<ref name=offd>{{Cite web |url=http://www.official-documents.gov.uk/document/cm70/7032/7032_iv.pdf |title=2010 post-revision map non-metropolitan areas and unitary authorities of England |access-date=2013-03-19 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6I5t6P5t1?url=http://www.official-documents.gov.uk/document/cm70/7032/7032_iv.pdf |archive-date=2013-07-14 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nA public review was called, dealing primarily with objections to receiving the rest of Bramley. Many petitioned to argue that the village's links, especially transport, were mainly with Guildford rather than the towns of [[Godalming]] (or [[Farnham]]). The precedent of the previous review was cited, when a proposal to move Bramley out of Guildford and into [[Mole Valley (UK Parliament constituency)|Mole Valley]] was rejected after local opposition. However, the review felt that this did not justify splitting the ward (something the Boundary Commission seeks to avoid completely) and that the other parts of the ward had strong links to Godalming. Furthermore, it cited the point that, in the previous review, Bramley Parish Council had stated that if it were to be moved it would prefer to be moved to South West Surrey and thus argued that the previous objection had accommodated a preferred progressive change towards being wholly in South West Surrey if necessary to equalise electorates.\n\n==History==\nThe constituency was created in 1983, largely replacing the former seat of [[Farnham (UK Parliament constituency)|Farnham]]. It has been consistently won by the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], though the majority dropped to a mere 861 votes in [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001]], leaving it as the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]]' third target constituency by [[swing (politics)|swing]] required.

constituencies|recommendations implemented by Parliament for 2010]] saw the realignment of the boundary with [[Guildford (UK Parliament constituency)|Guildford]] in order to bring it in line with adjustment of local government wards. Guildford's [[wikt:electorate|electorate]] was the largest of the county and this aimed to reduce it. Two wards split between the two constituencies: [[Bramley, Surrey|Bramley]]; and [[Busbridge]] and [[Hascombe]], afterwards entirely in South West Surrey; and the ward '[[Alfold]], [[Cranleigh]] Rural and Ellens Green' was split, so it was consolidated into Guildford for the 2010 general election. The net effect was to increase the number of voters in South West Surrey and reduce the number in Guildford.<ref name=offd>{{Cite web |url=http://www.official-documents.gov.uk/document/cm70/7032/7032_iv.pdf |title=2010 post-revision map non-metropolitan areas and unitary authorities of England |access-date=2013-03-19 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6I5t6P5t1?url=http://www.official-documents.gov.uk/document/cm70/7032/7032_iv.pdf |archive-date=2013-07-14 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nA public review was called, dealing primarily with objections to receiving the rest of Bramley. Many petitioned to argue that the village's links, especially transport, were mainly with Guildford rather than the towns of [[Godalming]] (or [[Farnham]]). The precedent of the previous review was cited, when a proposal to move Bramley out of Guildford and into [[Mole Valley (UK Parliament constituency)|Mole Valley]] was rejected after local opposition. However, the review felt that this did not justify splitting the ward (something the Boundary Commission seeks to avoid completely) and that the other parts of the ward had strong links to Godalming.
