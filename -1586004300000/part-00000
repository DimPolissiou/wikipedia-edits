Despite being executed in 1979 by Islamic Revolutionaries, he is widely lauded as the \"father of the Iranian Air Force\" along with general [[Mohammad Amir Khatami|Mohammad Khatami]] and general [[ Amir Hossein Rabii ]] , for modernizing the Air Force to become a potent and powerful force whose advanced equipment and training they acquired for Iran, such as the [[F-14 Tomcat]], would save Iran's crucial infrastructure during the [[Iran\u2013Iraq War]]. He was the Leader of the [[Golden Crown]], the first and national aerobatics display Iranian team. He is nicknamed as the \"blue eyed general of Iran\".\n\n==Early life and education==\nJahanbani was born into a family with a long military history. His father, [[Amanullah Jahanbani]], was a lieutenant general, who served in the [[Persian Cossack Brigade]] with [[Reza Shah Pahlavi]]. He was a [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar]] prince, great grandson of [[Fath Ali Shah]].<ref name=qajar>{{cite web|title=The Qajar Dynasty|url=http://www.royalark.net/Persia/qajar17.htm|publisher=Royal Ark|accessdate=25 November 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Centers of Power in Iran|url=http://2001-2009.state.gov/documents/organization/70712.pdf|author=CIA|accessdate=5 August 2013|date=May 1972}}</ref> Nader's mother, Helen Kasminsky, was from the [[Russians|Russian]] aristocracy in [[Petrograd]]. He had one sister, Mehremonir and two brothers, Parviz, who was an officer in the Imperial Iranian Marines, and [[Khosrow Jahanbani|Khosrow]], who married [[Shahnaz Pahlavi]].<ref name=qajar />\n\nNader Jahanbani had two children from two wives, a son, Anushiravan, from his first wife, Azar Etessam, and a daughter, Golnar, from his second wife, Farah Zangeneh. Both children live in the United States.\n\nAmanullah was imprisoned when Nader Jahanbani was 12, but after [[Reza Shah]] died, he was released and made a senator by [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]]. By then, his father sent him to the Russian Air Force Academy, from which he graduated as a foreign cadet, and entered the IIAF in 1950 with the rank of first lieutenant.\n\nIn 1951, Jahanbani was selected to be sent to [[F\u00fcrstenfeldbruck Air Base]] in [[Germany]] to attend the jet pilot training school to become a pilot for the first Iranian jet fighter aircraft, the [[F-84 Thunderjet]], which was scheduled for delivery in 1955, along with 15 other pilots. Upon completion of the training, 10 pilots returned to Iran while Jahanbani, along with four others, continued their training to become instructors upon return to Iran.<ref name=gcrown/>\n\n==Career==\nAfter completing the Jet Instructor pilot course and returning to Iran, Jahanbani formed Iran's first aerobatic team, called the [[Golden Crown]] (Taje Talaii) together with other officers, including Mohammad Amir Khatami and [[Amir Hossein Rabi'i]].<ref name=gcrown>{{cite web|title=Golden Crown History|url=http://www.iiaf.net/goldencrown/goldenhist.html|work=IIAF|accessdate=31 July 2013}}</ref>\n\nJahanbani played a crucial role in the Iranian Air Force during the 1960s and 1970s by helping to create an effective air force.<ref name=MafinezamMehrabi2008>{{cite book|author1=Alidad Mafinezam|author2=Aria Mehrabi|title=Iran and Its Place Among Nations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PO_s9H5QTp4C&pg=PA35|accessdate=31 July 2013|year=2008|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-275-99926-1|pages=35}}</ref> He served as the Deputy Commander of the Air Force. As such, he worked hard to inculcate world-class air to air combat skills among the iranian fighter pilots. This work, led by Jahanbani, on improving the pilots  habilities, would prove crucial to the iranian air force in the later [[ Iran-Iraq war ]], when the  [[Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force| IRIAF ]] pilots clearly prevailed over its iraqi counterparts.    <ref name=omid/><ref>{{cite web|title=Law And Human Rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran|url=http://www.ihrv.org/inf/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/law_and_human_rights_in_the_islamic_republic_of_iran_february_through_september19791.pdf|work=Amnesty International|accessdate=3 August 2013|format=Report|date=13 March 1980|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924033336/http://www.ihrv.org/inf/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/law_and_human_rights_in_the_islamic_republic_of_iran_february_through_september19791.pdf|archivedate=24 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> He was also general secretary of the National Sports Federation.<ref name=omid/><ref name=sapia1>{{cite web|title=Pictures|url=http://saipa.us/poutzsh.jpg|publisher=Sapia|accessdate=7 November 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008092038/http://saipa.us/poutzsh.jpg|archivedate=8 October 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Death==\nWhen the Shah declared martial law in response to [[Iranian Revolution|mounting protests]] in 1978, and put military officers in charge, Jahanbani was not one of the military commanders, since he had very little experience with internal security affairs. As a result, when the Shah fled, despite the urging of his family, his friends in the [[US Air Force]], as well as the Shah himself and his daughter [[Shahnaz Pahlavi|Shahnaz]] (who was his sister in-law), Jahanbani falsely thought that he was safe from possible purges and retaliation against the security officials who suppressed the protests, as well as his belief that Iran's powerful air force would be a testament of his loyalty to the country, not the Shah himself.\n\nKhomeini subsequently ordered the Revolutionary Guards to arrest Jahanbani, among others, at the Air Force headquarters at Doshan Tappeh. He was one of the first of the Shah's generals to be arrested, and was sent to a court run by the infamous [[Sadegh Khalkhali]].\n\nHe was charged and convicted with:\n<blockquote> Association with the Shah's idolatrous regime; Corruption on earth; Unspecified anti-revolutionary offense; War on God, God's Prophet, and the deputy of the Twelfth Imam</blockquote>\n\nHe was taken to [[Qasr Prison]] and in the early hours of 13 March 1979 he was shot in the courtyard of the prison.<ref name=iiaf>{{cite web|title=IIAF Personnel killed by Islamic Regime between 1979 - Present|url=http://www.iiaf.net/history/commemorates.html|work=Imperial Iranian Air Force|accessdate=30 July 2013}}</ref> His last words were \"long live Iran\".<ref name=omid>{{cite web|title=Mr. Nader Jahanbani|url=http://www.iranrights.org/english/memorial-case--3611.php|publisher=OMID|accessdate=15 March 2013}}</ref>\n\nEmpress Farah Pahlavi wrote:\n\n<blockquote>\"A bit later, I managed to contact by phone a dear friend whose husband, Air Force Lieutenant General Nader Jahanbani, had just been executed. Insulted by one of the guardians of the revolution, he had the courage to slap him in the face before dying. She was sobbing and I, who should have been able to find words to comfort her, could do nothing but cry with her. That evening, in despair, I wrote these few lines in my notebook: \"I don't feel I have the strength in me to go on fighting. I would prefer to die for my country with honor rather than be dragged toward death by the depression that is overtaking me.

Despite being executed in 1979 by Islamic Revolutionaries, he is widely lauded as the \"father of the Iranian Air Force\" along with general [[Mohammad Amir Khatami|Mohammad Khatami]] and general [[ Amir Hossein Rabii ]] , for modernizing the Air Force to become a potent and powerful force whose advanced equipment and training they acquired for Iran, such as the [[F-14 Tomcat]], would save Iran's crucial infrastructure during the [[Iran\u2013Iraq War]]. He was the Leader of the [[Golden Crown]], the first and national aerobatics display Iranian team. He is nicknamed as the \"blue eyed general of Iran\".\n\n==Early life and education==\nJahanbani was born into a family with a long military history. His father, [[Amanullah Jahanbani]], was a lieutenant general, who served in the [[Persian Cossack Brigade]] with [[Reza Shah Pahlavi]]. He was a [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar]] prince, great grandson of [[Fath Ali Shah]].<ref name=qajar>{{cite web|title=The Qajar Dynasty|url=http://www.royalark.net/Persia/qajar17.htm|publisher=Royal Ark|accessdate=25 November 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Centers of Power in Iran|url=http://2001-2009.state.gov/documents/organization/70712.pdf|author=CIA|accessdate=5 August 2013|date=May 1972}}</ref> Nader's mother, Helen Kasminsky, was from the [[Russians|Russian]] aristocracy in [[Petrograd]]. He had one sister, Mehremonir and two brothers, Parviz, who was an officer in the Imperial Iranian Marines, and [[Khosrow Jahanbani|Khosrow]], who married [[Shahnaz Pahlavi]].<ref name=qajar />\n\nNader Jahanbani had two children from two wives, a son, Anushiravan, from his first wife, Azar Etessam, and a daughter, Golnar, from his second wife, Farah Zangeneh. Both children live in the United States.\n\nAmanullah was imprisoned when Nader Jahanbani was 12, but after [[Reza Shah]] died, he was released and made a senator by [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]]. By then, his father sent him to the Russian Air Force Academy, from which he graduated as a foreign cadet, and entered the IIAF in 1950 with the rank of first lieutenant.\n\nIn 1951, Jahanbani was selected to be sent to [[F\u00fcrstenfeldbruck Air Base]] in [[Germany]] to attend the jet pilot training school to become a pilot for the first Iranian jet fighter aircraft, the [[F-84 Thunderjet]], which was scheduled for delivery in 1955, along with 15 other pilots. Upon completion of the training, 10 pilots returned to Iran while Jahanbani, along with four others, continued their training to become instructors upon return to Iran.<ref name=gcrown/>\n\n==Career==\nAfter completing the Jet Instructor pilot course and returning to Iran, Jahanbani formed Iran's first aerobatic team, called the [[Golden Crown]] (Taje Talaii) together with other officers, including Mohammad Amir Khatami and [[Amir Hossein Rabi'i]].<ref name=gcrown>{{cite web|title=Golden Crown History|url=http://www.iiaf.net/goldencrown/goldenhist.html|work=IIAF|accessdate=31 July 2013}}</ref>\n\nJahanbani played a crucial role in the Iranian Air Force during the 1960s and 1970s by helping to create an effective air force.<ref name=MafinezamMehrabi2008>{{cite book|author1=Alidad Mafinezam|author2=Aria Mehrabi|title=Iran and Its Place Among Nations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PO_s9H5QTp4C&pg=PA35|accessdate=31 July 2013|year=2008|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-275-99926-1|pages=35}}</ref> He served as the Deputy Commander of the Air Force. As such, he worked hard to inculcate world-class air to air combat skills among the iranian fighter pilots. This work, led by Jahanbani, on improving the pilots  habilities, would prove crucial to the iranian air force in the later [[ Iran-Iraq war ]], when the  [[ IRIAF ]] pilots clearly prevailed over its iraqi counterparts.    <ref name=omid/><ref>{{cite web|title=Law And Human Rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran|url=http://www.ihrv.org/inf/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/law_and_human_rights_in_the_islamic_republic_of_iran_february_through_september19791.pdf|work=Amnesty International|accessdate=3 August 2013|format=Report|date=13 March 1980|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924033336/http://www.ihrv.org/inf/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/law_and_human_rights_in_the_islamic_republic_of_iran_february_through_september19791.pdf|archivedate=24 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> He was also general secretary of the National Sports Federation.<ref name=omid/><ref name=sapia1>{{cite web|title=Pictures|url=http://saipa.us/poutzsh.jpg|publisher=Sapia|accessdate=7 November 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008092038/http://saipa.us/poutzsh.jpg|archivedate=8 October 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Death==\nWhen the Shah declared martial law in response to [[Iranian Revolution|mounting protests]] in 1978, and put military officers in charge, Jahanbani was not one of the military commanders, since he had very little experience with internal security affairs. As a result, when the Shah fled, despite the urging of his family, his friends in the [[US Air Force]], as well as the Shah himself and his daughter [[Shahnaz Pahlavi|Shahnaz]] (who was his sister in-law), Jahanbani falsely thought that he was safe from possible purges and retaliation against the security officials who suppressed the protests, as well as his belief that Iran's powerful air force would be a testament of his loyalty to the country, not the Shah himself.\n\nKhomeini subsequently ordered the Revolutionary Guards to arrest Jahanbani, among others, at the Air Force headquarters at Doshan Tappeh. He was one of the first of the Shah's generals to be arrested, and was sent to a court run by the infamous [[Sadegh Khalkhali]].\n\nHe was charged and convicted with:\n<blockquote> Association with the Shah's idolatrous regime; Corruption on earth; Unspecified anti-revolutionary offense; War on God, God's Prophet, and the deputy of the Twelfth Imam</blockquote>\n\nHe was taken to [[Qasr Prison]] and in the early hours of 13 March 1979 he was shot in the courtyard of the prison.<ref name=iiaf>{{cite web|title=IIAF Personnel killed by Islamic Regime between 1979 - Present|url=http://www.iiaf.net/history/commemorates.html|work=Imperial Iranian Air Force|accessdate=30 July 2013}}</ref> His last words were \"long live Iran\".<ref name=omid>{{cite web|title=Mr. Nader Jahanbani|url=http://www.iranrights.org/english/memorial-case--3611.php|publisher=OMID|accessdate=15 March 2013}}</ref>\n\nEmpress Farah Pahlavi wrote:\n\n<blockquote>\"A bit later, I managed to contact by phone a dear friend whose husband, Air Force Lieutenant General Nader Jahanbani, had just been executed.

The present Air Force came into being in the early 1980s when the former [[Imperial Iranian Air Force]] was renamed. It's one of the few air forces in the Middle East, with experience in a conventional war, having fought the [[Iran-Iraq War]] in the 80s. It has carried out major  operations like [[Operation Kaman 99]], the [[H-3 airstrike]], and the first attack on a nuclear reactor in history, in [[Operation Scorch Sword]]. It has also produced the last two [[fighter aces]] of the contemporary era, with [[Jalil Zandi]] (11 kills) and [[Shahram Rostami]] (6 kills), both flying the [[F-14 Tomcat]] jet. Evolving from its experiences in that conflict, the IRIAF has developed real battle tested tactics and a cadre of skillful pilots. Many of them, veterans of the 8 year war and nowadays senior generals, form the core of today's IRIAF command.\n\nThe Air Force has attempted with some success to maintain in service the large number of American-built aircraft which Iran acquired during the [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi|Shah]]'s regime. The Air Force has turned to purchases of Russian and Chinese aircraft, as well as pressing ex-[[Iraq]]i aircraft into service, and indigenously built aircraft, in order to maintain a capable force. As of June 2019, the Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force possesses 350 fighters, making it the ninth most powerful air arm in the world, as per Global Firepower.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/06/27/iran-s-trying-to-rebuild-its-air-force|title=Iran\u2019s Trying to Rebuild Its Air Force|first=David|last=Axe|date=27 June 2016|publisher=|via=www.thedailybeast.com}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of the Iranian Air Force}}\nThe IRIAF came into being when the former [[Imperial Iranian Air Force]] (IIAF) was renamed following the Islamic Revolution in Iran, in February 1979. The British publishing company Orbis' ''Warplane'' partwork magazine seems to indicate the renaming did not actually take place until after the [[Iran\u2013Iraq War]] had broken out.\n\nThis \"new\" Iranian air force largely inherited the equipment and structure of the former IIAF, even losing most of its leading officers in the course of post-revolutionary chaos, as well as due to the prosecution of those considered as loyal to the Shah, pro-U.S. or elsewhere by the new government in Tehran.\n\nDue to strained relations with the west, Iran had to procure new equipment from [[Brazil]], Russia and the People's Republic of China. Since the Revolution, the exact composition of the IRIAF is hard to determine, but estimates do exist. Many aircraft belonging to the [[Iraqi Air Force]] took refuge in Iran during the [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]] in 1991, and many were put into service with the IRIAF or taken apart for spare parts.\n\nDue to the continuous spare parts shortages faced by the air force, a decision was made in the late 1980s to develop a local aerospace industry to support the air force.\n\nIn 2002, Iran with the co-operation of [[Ukraine]], successfully started the manufacture of the Iran-140; a licence-built version of the [[Antonov]] [[Antonov An-140|An-140]] transport aircraft. Simultaneously, Iran began construction of two domestically produced fighters, upgraded using technology from the [[F-14 Tomcat]] and the [[F-5 Freedom Fighter|F-5 Tiger II]]. The fighters have been named the [[Azarakhsh]] and the [[Shafaq]].\n\nSince then the country has also become self-sufficient in the manufacture of helicopters. The country claims that it is capable of producing the U.S. [[AH-1 Cobra]] gunship. Additionally, Iran also produces [[Bell Helicopter]] [[Bell 212]] and [[Bell 206]] helicopters in serial production. These are known respectively as the [[Shabaviz 2-75]] and the Shabaviz 206.\n\n===Iran\u2013Iraq War (1980\u201388)===\n[[File:C-130 Iran 1988 DN-SN-89-02586.JPEG|thumb|An IRIAF C-130 ''Hercules'' in 1988]]\n\nA series of purges and forced retirements resulted in the manpower of the service being halved between February 1979 and July 1980, leaving the IRIAF ill-prepared for the [[Iran\u2013Iraq War]] (also called the \"1st Persian Gulf War\"). The sudden Iraqi air strikes against eight major Iranian airbases and four other military installations, launched on the afternoon of 22 September 1980, came as a complete surprise and caused a shock in the IRIAF.\n\nThe Iranians retaliated with operation Kaman-99 which involved 206 F-4, F-5 and F-14 aircraft.\n\nOn 23 September 1980, Iran launched [[Operation Kaman 99]] as 40 [[McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II#Armament|F-4 Phantoms, armed with]] [[Mark 82]], Mark 83 and Mark 84 bombs and AGM-65 Maverick missiles, took off from Hamadan. After refueling in mid-air the Phantoms reached the Iraqi capital Baghdad, where they attacked: al-Rashid, [[al-Habbaniyah airbase|al-Habbaniyah ]] and [[al-Kut airbase]]s.\n\nMeanwhile, eight More F-4s took off from Tehran and launched a second attack on the [[al-Rashid airbase]].\n\nIran proceeded to launch 58 F-5E Tiger IIs from Tabriz, which were sent to attack Mosul Airbase. After the attack on Mosul Airbase, another 50 F-5Es were dispatched to strike Nasiriyah Airbase, which was heavily damaged.\n\nAs all 148 Iranian F-4s and F-5s had been sent for a bombing raid on Iraq, 60 F-14 Tomcats were scrambled to defend Iranian airspace against a possible Iraqi retaliation. Iranian F-14s managed to down 2 Iraqi MiG-21s (1 MiG-21RF and 1 MiG-21MF) and 3 Iraqi MiG-23s (MiG-23MS), an Iranian F-5E also shot down an Iraqi Su-20 during the operation. Iraqi MiG-23s managed to down 2 F-5Es, while Iraqi MiG-21s also downed 2 F-5Es. Iraqis also by mistake shot down one of their own Il-76MD strategic airlifters with a SA-3 SAM.\n\nThe Iraqis however were well prepared for the attack and had flown over most of their air force to other Arab countries, such as Saudi Arabia, this made sure that most of the Iraqi Air Force survived the operation.\n\nSaddam Hussein and the Iraqi military were dealt a heavy blow when Iranian Air Force vulnerabilities failed to materialize. All Iraqi airbases near Iran were out of order for weeks and, according to Iran, Iraq's aerial efficiency was reduced by 55%. This allowed Iranians to regroup and prepare for the upcoming Iraqi invasion.\n\nAlthough the readiness rates of the IRIAF significantly increased in the following months, its overall role and influence declined, as the clerical government prioritized resources for the [[Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps]] (IRGC) militias and simultaneously attempted to develop a separate air arm for this service.\n\nAfter the successful liberation of most Iranian areas captured by the Iraqis in the first half of 1982, the situation of the IRIAF changed completely. From an air arm that was offensive by nature, it was largely relegated to air defense and relatively infrequent bombing attacks against targets of industrial and military significance inside Iraq. Simultaneously, the IRIAF had to learn how to maintain and keep operational its large fleet of U.S.-built aircraft and helicopters without outside help, due to American sanctions. Relying primarily on antiquated equipment purchased from the US in the 1970s, the Iranians began establishing their own aerospace industry; their efforts in this remained largely unrecognized until recently.\n\n[[File:Iranian Lockheed P-3F Orion in flight over the Strait of Hormuz on 1 August 1994 (6491410).jpg|thumb|right|A P-3F Orion of the Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force]]\nDuring 1984 and 1985, the IRIAF found itself confronted by an ever-better organized and equipped opponent, as the Iraqi Air force\u2014reinforced by deliveries of advanced fighter-bombers from France and the Soviet Union\u2014launched numerous offensives against Iranian air bases, military bases, industrial infrastructures, powerplants, oil-export hubs, and population centers. These became better known as \"The Tanker War\" and \"The War of the Cities\". To defend against an increasing number of Iraqi air strikes, the IRIAF leaned heavily on its large fleet of Grumman [[F-14 Tomcat]] interceptor fighters. Tomcats were mainly deployed in defense of the strategically important Khark Island (main hub for Iranian oil exports), and Tehran. Over 300 air-to-air engagements against IQAF fighters, fighter-bombers, and bombers, were fought in these areas alone between 1980 and 1988.{{citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n\nConfronted with the fact that it could not obtain replacements for equipment lost in what became a war of attrition against Iraq, the IRIAF remained defense-orientated for the rest of the conflict, conserving its surviving assets as a \"force in being\". From mid 1987, the IRIAF found itself confronted also with U.S. Navy fighters over the Persian Gulf. A number of confrontations that occurred between July 1987 and August 1988 stretched available IRIAF assets to the limit, exhausting its capability to defend Iranian air space against Iraqi air strikes. Despite limitations and sanctions, the IRIAF achieved an extremely successful rate in air to air combat against iraqi jets, to the point that in air to air engagements, Iran\u2019s kill ratio was roughly 5:1, which is only surpassed by the Israelis against Syria in 1982 and the US in the Gulf war in 1991. Very often, air engagements consisted of 1-2 Iranian fighters engaging 4, or even 8 Iraqi fighters and winning. It got to the point where Iraq ordered its pilots to avoid air to air engagements (especially with the F-14).<ref>{{cite book|url=https://kavehfarrokh.com/book-review/books-on-the-history-of-the-iranian-air-force-by-farzad-bishop-and-tom-cooper-2/|title=Iranian F-14 Tomcat Units in Combat (Combat Aurcraft 49)|publisher=Osprey Publishing|year=2004|isbn=978-1841767871|first1=Tom|last1=Cooper|first2=Farzad|last2=Bishop}}</ref> Many other iranian [[ fighter pilots ]] , claimed world records during the war, such as General Yadollah Khalili, who holds the worldwide record of the longest straight flight in a [[ fighter plane ]] , having flown an [[ F-14 ]] non-stop for 11 hours, thus having had to do [[ aerial refuelling ]] 8 times during the process.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6vGT5TByDc</ref> As a result of this war, the  IRIAF  developed proven tactics and skillful battle tested pilots, thus becoming one of the most experienced air arms in the region.\n\nOne of the most notable [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] fighter pilot was [[Jalil Zandi]]. His fame came as a [[F-14 Tomcat]] [[Aviator|pilot]] ace. He has been reliably credited with shooting down 11 [[Iraq]]i fighter jets. Other notable pilots include [[Shahram Rostami]], [[Hossein Khalatbari]], [[Abbas Doran]], [[Ghafour Jeddi]] and [[Ali Eghbali Dogahe]] among many others.\n\n===Post Iran\u2013Iraq War===\n[[File:Iranian Air Force Hercules Habibi.jpg|thumb|An Iranian [[C-130]] ''Hercules'' in 2010]]\n\nImmediately after the end of the Iran\u2013Iraq War, the IRIAF was partially rebuilt through limited purchases of [[MiG-29]] fighters and [[Su-24]] bombers from the Soviet Union, as well as [[F-7 Skybolt|F-7]]M  and FT-7 fighters from China. While providing needed reinforcement to the Iranian Air Force, these types never replaced the older, U.S.-built F-4 Phantoms, F-14s (the IRIAF is now the only air arm in the world using the fighter), or F-5s. Instead, the IRIAF continued its efforts to keep these types in service, and began a number of projects to refurbish and upgrade them.\n\n===1990s===\nDuring the 1991 [[Persian Gulf War]], numerous Iraqi pilots flew Iraqi Air Force aircraft to Iran to avoid destruction by coalition forces. The Iranians impounded these aircraft and never returned them, putting them in service in the IRIAF<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/381277.stm|work=BBC|title=World: Middle East Iran 'makes own warplane'|date=29 June 1999|access-date=16 March 2020}}</ref> and claiming them as reparations for the Iran\u2013Iraq War. The aircraft included several [[Mirage F1]]s, [[MiG-23]]s, MiG-29s, [[Su-20]]s, [[Su-17|Su-22Ms]], Su-24s, [[Su-25]]s and a number of [[Il-76]]s, including the secret, one-off AEW-AWACS Il-76 \"ADNAN 1\" prototype.\n\nEven after the cease-fire with Iraq, the IRIAF carried out several air raids against [[Kurdish separatism in Iran|Kurdish]] bases in [[Northern Iraq]]. The first of such raids was conducted using eight F-4s armed with rockets and cluster bombs on 6 April 1992 against [[People's Mujahedin of Iran]]'s [[Camp Ashraf]]. During this event one F-4 was shot down by either insurgent or Iraqi military AAA and both pilots (Lt. Col Amini and Cpt. Sharifi) were captured and not freed until 1998. Despite threats of response, Iraq wasn't able to retaliate due to its own fight against Kurdish separatist guerrillas and the [[Iraqi no-fly zones|Western-imposed no-fly zones]] that crippled and limited its air force's operations.<ref name=\"nytimes\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/06/world/iran-strafes-rebels-in-iraq-jet-downed.html|title=Iran Strafes Rebels in Iraq - Jet Downed|work=The New York Times|accessdate=2015-02-07}}</ref><ref name=\"ejection-history\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ejection-history.org.uk/Country-By-Country/iranian_f_4_phantom_losses.htm|title=iranian_F_4_Phantom_LOSSES|publisher=ejection-history.org.uk|accessdate=2015-02-07|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150710211447/http://www.ejection-history.org.uk/country-by-country/iranian_f_4_phantom_losses.htm|archivedate=2015-07-10}}</ref>\n\nIn 2007, Iraq asked Iran to return some of the scores of Iraqi fighter plans that flew there ahead of the Gulf War in 1991.<ref name=\"reuters.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iraq-airforce-idUSCOL54415720070805|title=Iraq air force wants Iran to give back its planes|date=5 August 2007|publisher=|via=www.reuters.com}}</ref> And as of 2014, Iran was receptive to the demands and was working on refurbishing an unspecified number of jets.<ref name=\"scmp.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.scmp.com/news/world/article/1542427/new-us-planes-slow-arrive-iraq-seeks-remnants-saddams-air-force-bomb-isil|title=With new US planes slow to arrive, Iraq seeks remnants of Saddam's air force to bomb ISIL|date=28 June 2014|website=South China Morning Post}}</ref><ref name=\"washingtonpost.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2014/06/27/be172f43-cf98-4677-8e6d-4d64a5ae5e1d_story.html|title=Iraq cobbling together makeshift air force to fight ISIS|first=Loveday|last=Morris|date=27 June 2014|access-date=16 March 2020|work=The Washington Post}}</ref> In late 2014, Iran returned 130 military aircraft to Iraq.<ref name=\"middleeastmonitor.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20140623-iran-returns-military-aircraft-to-iraq-after-20-years/|title=Iran returns military aircraft to Iraq after 20 years|date=23 June 2014|website=Middle East Monitor}}</ref>\n\n===2000s===\nIn 2006, after Iranian media published a series of reports suggesting that [[Venezuela]] was interested in selling its 21 [[F-16 Fighting Falcon]]s to Iran,<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090216034033/http://www.aftabnews.ir/vdciwwa5.t1a5z2bcct.html \u0686\u0627\u0648\u0632: \u062c\u0646\u06af\u0646\u062f\u0647 \u0647\u0627\u06cc \u0627\u0641 \u2013 \u06f1\u06f6 \u0631\u0627 \u0627\u062d\u062a\u0645\u0627\u0644\u0627 \u0628\u0647 \u0627\u06cc\u0631\u0627\u0646 \u0645\u06cc \u0641\u0631\u0648\u0634\u06cc\u0645] (Aftab News)</ref> a [[Hugo Chavez]] adviser confirmed to the [[Associated Press]] that \"Venezuela's military is considering selling its fleet of U.S.-made F-16 fighter jets to another country, possibly Iran, in response to a U.S. ban on arms sales to President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez's government\".

A video released by [[Aljazeera]] seemed to show an Iranian [[F-4 Phantom II]] bombing some [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIS]] buildings in [[Diyala Governorate]].<ref>[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/12/01/us-iran-iraq_n_6251894.html Iran Bombing Islamic State In Iraq, U.S. Official Confirms] ''[[Huffington Post]]''</ref>\n\n==Current composition==\nThe IRIAF composition has changed very little since 1979. The first, limited re-location of several units\u2014including disbandment of some and establishment of new squadrons\u2014occurred in late 1980, when the F-4D fleet was concentrated at Shiraz, two squadrons of F-4Es moved from Shiraz to Hamedan, and a squadron of F-14 Tomcats deployed to Mehrabad. Other deployments during the war with Iraq were mainly of temporary character, even if a major re-organization of existing air-defense assets\u2014foremost SAM and AAA units\u2014was undertaken in 1985. There has been no major re-organization during all of the 1990s, either.\n\n[[File:HESA Azarakhsh displayed in Vahdati Airbase.jpg|thumb|left|HESA Azarakhsh]]\nEquipment, capabilities, and combat performance of the IRIAF strongly influenced the development of the Iraqi Air Force (IQAF), during the 1980s, but also that of the [[United Arab Emirates Air Force]], in the 1990s and the most recent times.\n\nIn 2013, Iran changed the status of its airports and former Tac Air Bases in combined airfields according to its current policy of having limited fixed units stationed as IRIAF's new policy is using composite units. These composite units may be stationed at any airfield and may be moved overnight to any other airfield at short notice. Therefore, all combined airfields are or will be accommodated with basic cross-service capabilities to handle all IRIAF aircraft.\n\nWhile Iran has been under sanctions since 1979 and these sanctions have become more intense after the country started its nuclear program, Iran has become one of only a handful of countries capable of servicing and overhauling its own military and civilian aircraft. However, less tension in the current (2015) international situation led to a decrease of the sanctions, and the Iranian government is now capable again in ordering a new fleet of civilian aircraft replacing the aged types.\n\n[[File:Mirage F1BQ of IRIAF.jpg|thumb|A Mirage F1BQ landing]]\n[[File:Iran Air Force Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-29UB Sharifi.jpg|thumb|A MiG-29UB of the Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force in 2011.]]\n[[File:A Sukhoi Su-24MK of IRIAF flighting over Shiraz.jpg|thumb|right|An Su-24MK of the IRIAF flying over Shahid Dastghaib International Airport.]]\n\n===Jane's Sentinel estimate of units 1993===\n''Source: Jane's Sentinel, Islamic Republic of Iran, 1993, p.&nbsp;27 \u2013 not complete''\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Tactical Air Base\n!Location\n!Type\n!Unit\n|-\n|TAB 1\n|[[Mehrabad International Airport|Mehrabad]]\n|F-5E\n|squadron\n|-\n|\n|Mehrabad\n|F-7M\n|squadron\n|-\n|\n|Mehrabad\n|F-14A/MiG-29\n|squadron\n|-\n|\n|Mehrabad\n|C-130H/Il-76\n|squadron\n|-\n|\n|Mehrabad\n|F 27/Falcom\n|squadron\n|-\n|TAB 2\n|[[Tabriz Air Base|Tabriz]]\n|F-4D/E\n|squadron\n|-\n|\n|Tabriz\n|[[F-5E]]\n|squadron\n|-\n|\n|Tabriz\n|F-7M\n|squadron\n|-\n|\n|Tabriz\n|[[C-130]]H\n|flight\n|-\n|TAB 3\n|[[Hamadan Air Base|Hamadan]]\n|F-6\n|squadron\n|-\n|\n|Hamadan\n|F-7M\n|squadron\n|-\n|TAB 4\n|[[Dezful Air Base|Dezful]]\n|F-4D/E\n|squadron\n|-\n|TAB 4\n|Dezful\n|F-5E\n|squadron\n|-\n|TAB 5\n|not identified\n|\n|\n|-\n|TAB 6\n|[[Bushehr Air Base|Bushehr]]\n|[[F-4 Phantom II|F-4D/E]]\n|squadron\n|-\n|\n|Bushehr\n|[[Chengdu J-7|F-7M]]\n|flight\n|-\n|\n|Bushehr\n|[[C-130]]H\n|flight\n|-\n|TAB 7\n|[[Shiraz Air Base|Shiraz]]\n|[[Northrop F-5]]\n|squadron\n|-\n|\n|Shiraz\n|[[F-14]]A/[[MiG-29]]\n|squadron\n|-\n|\n|Shiraz\n|[[C-130]]H/[[Il-76]]\n|squadron\n|-\n|\n|Shiraz\n|[[Fokker F27 Friendship|F-27]]\n|flight\n|}\n* 71 ASW Squadron ([[Lockheed P-3 Orion]]) Shiraz\n\n==Alleged purchases==\n\n===Su-30===\nIt is reported that Israeli defense officials were investigating a potential Iran\u2013Russia deal, in which Iran would pay $1&nbsp;billion for a dozen squadrons\u2019 worth of Su-30 jets.<ref name=\"globalsecurity.org\">{{cite web|author=John Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/iran/airforce.htm |title=Iran Air Force |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |date= |accessdate=2013-04-22}}</ref> Iran and Russia have both denied this and have rejected these claims as propaganda.<ref>[[DEBKAfile]] [http://www.debka.com/headline.php?hid=4449 DEBKA Reports: Iran buys 250 long-distance Sukhoi fighter-bombers, 20 fuel tankers, from Russia] 1 August 2007</ref><ref>''Navy Times'' [http://www.navytimes.com/news/2007/07/navy_iran_fighters_070730w/ Reports: Iran may buy 250 jets from Russia] 1 August 2007</ref><ref>defensetech [http://www.defensetech.org/archives/003636.html Iran's New Fighter?] 2 August 2007</ref> In a broadcast the Mehr News Agency reported that they (the reporters) saw a dozen Su-30s in a maneuver that took place on 15 and 16 September 2008; further the report reads: \"In this joint maneuver of the IRIAF and the AFAGIR which is called the 'Guardians of the Nations Skies' the Air Forces of Iran have tested domestically developed systems as well as newly purchased systems (from Russia and China).\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mehrnews.com/fa/newsdetail.aspx?NewsID=751789 |title=Iran, world, political, sport, economic news and headlines |publisher=MehrNews.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-22}}</ref>\n\n===J-10===\nThe Russian news agency [[RIA Novosti|Novosti]] reported that ''Business & Financial Markets'' said Iran has signed a deal with China to buy two squadrons/24 of [[Chengdu J-10|J-10]] fighter planes with Russian-made [[AL-31]]FN engines.

Some of these facilities have since seen full-scale deployments of IRIAF units, and it now appears that at least two became permanent \"Tactical Fighter Bases\" (TFBs). These are the first such bases established since 1979. Except new airfields, with Chinese support, the IRIAF constructed also a number of new early warning radar sites around the country. Its ability to control the national airspace, however, remains limited\u2014mainly due to the rugged terrain and lack of airborne early warning assets.\n\nAside from maintaining 14 TFBs, the IRIAF operates numerous temporary detachments on several minor airfields around the country. Ex-Iraqi Mirage F.1EQs, usually based at TFB.14, near Mashhad, were frequently seen over the Persian Gulf, in 2005 and 2006.\n\n==Missiles and rockets==\n[[File:Fakour-90 missile.jpg|thumb|[[Fakour-90]] missile (yellow) on display at the Eqtedar-40 defence exhibition]]\nOn 8 March 2009, Iran declared that it has successfully armed some of its front-line fighter jets with domestically manufactured long-range [[air-to-surface missiles]], which are capable of hitting targets within a range of more than 110 kilometers at sea.<ref>[http://www.presstv.ir/detail.aspx?id=87932&sectionid=351020101 Iranian jets will fire long-range missiles], [[PressTV]], Retrieved on 8 March 2009.</ref>\n\n==Major operations==\n* [[Iran\u2013Iraq War]]\n** [[Operation Kaman 99]], Iran's biggest air raid during Iran\u2013Iraq war with a strength of more than 140 aircraft.\n** [[Operation Scorch Sword]] An Iranian airstrike on an Iraqi nuclear reactor under construction.\n** [[H-3 airstrike]], IRIAF's boldest operation in Iraq\n** [[Operation Pearl]], a successful joint operation by Iranian air force and navy in Persian Gulf against the Iraqi air force and navy.\n** [[Operation Sultan 10]], an operation to disturb delivery and training of new French fighter planes to Iraqi airforce during the Iran\u2013Iraq war.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Flying ace]]\n* [[F-14 Tomcat operational history]]\n* [[Iranian aerial victories during the Iran\u2013Iraq war]]\n* [[Iraqi aerial victories during the Iran\u2013Iraq war]]\n* [[List of aces of aces]]\n\n==References==\n;Notes\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Air force of Iran}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20160507132820/http://nahaja.aja.ir/Portal/Home/ Official site of the Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force]\n* [http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/iran/airforce.htm Globalsecurity.org]\n\n{{Iran Military}}\n{{air forces}}\n{{NAHAJA Commanders}}\n{{IIAF Commanders}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Islamic Republic Of Iran Air Force}}\n[[Category:Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force| ]]\n[[Category:Military units and formations established in 1979]]\n[[Category:1979 establishments in Iran]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|Air Force of Iran's regular military|Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps' similar force|Aerospace Force of the Army of the Guardians of the Islamic Revolution}}\n{{pp|small=yes}}\n{{short description|Air warfare branch of Iran's regular military}}\n{{Infobox military unit\n|unit_name= Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force\n|native_name=\u0646\u06cc\u0631\u0648\u06cc \u0647\u0648\u0627\u06cc\u06cc \u0627\u0631\u062a\u0634 \u062c\u0645\u0647\u0648\u0631\u06cc \u0627\u0633\u0644\u0627\u0645\u06cc \u0627\u06cc\u0631\u0627\u0646\u200e\n|image= [[File:IRI.Army Air Force Seal.svg|centre|210px]]\n|caption= \n|start_date={{Start date and age|1925}}\n|country= {{flagu|Iran}}\n|type= [[Air force]]\n|role= [[Aerial warfare]]\n|size= 37,000 ([[Middle East Institute|MEI]] 2011 estimate)<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.mei.edu/content/artesh-iran%E2%80%99s-marginalized-and-under-armed-conventional-military|title=The Artesh: Iran\u2019s Marginalized and Under-Armed Conventional Military|access-date=December 15, 2015|publisher=[[Middle East Institute]]|date= November 15, 2011|author=Hossein Aryan}}</ref>\n|command_structure=[[Islamic Republic of Iran Army|Artesh]]\n|garrison= [[Tehran]]\n|garrison_label=\n|motto={{lang-fa|\u0628\u0644\u0646\u062f \u0622\u0633\u0645\u0627\u0646 \u062c\u0627\u06cc\u06af\u0627\u0647 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0633\u062a}}<br>\"''Skyhigh Is My Place''\"\n|nickname={{lang-fa|\u062a\u06cc\u0632\u067e\u0631\u0648\u0627\u0632\u0627\u0646}}, ''Tizparvazan''<br>\"Fastflyers\"\n|patron=\n|colors= {{Color box|#3F00FF}} [[Ultramarine|Ultramarine Blue]]\n|colors_label=\n|march=18 April\n|mascot=[[Eagle]]\n|equipment=741 aircraft/helicopters\n|equipment_label=\n|battles= {{plainlist|\n* [[Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran|Anglo-Soviet invasion]]\n* [[Joint Operation Arvand]]\n* [[Dhofar War]]\n* [[Iran\u2013Iraq War]]\n* [[2014 military intervention against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|Military intervention against ISIS]]\n}}\n|anniversaries=8 February (Air Force Day)\n|battle_honours=\n<!-- Commanders -->\n|commander1= Brig Gen.

The present Air Force came into being in the early 1980s when the former [[Imperial Iranian Air Force]] was renamed. It's one of the few air forces in the Middle East, with experience in a conventional war, having fought the [[Iran-Iraq War]] in the 80s. It has carried out major  operations like [[Operation Kaman 99]], the [[H-3 airstrike]], and the first attack on a nuclear reactor in history, in [[Operation Scorch Sword]]. It has also produced the last two [[fighter aces]] of the contemporary era, with [[Jalil Zandi]] (11 kills) and [[Shahram Rostami]] (6 kills), both flying the [[F-14 Tomcat]] jet. Evolving from its experiences in that conflict, the IRIAF has developed real battle tested tactics and a cadre of skillful pilots. Many of them, veterans of the 8 year war and nowadays senior generals, form the core of today's IRIAF command.\n\nThe Air Force has attempted with some success to maintain in service the large number of American-built aircraft which Iran acquired during the [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi|Shah]]'s regime. The Air Force has turned to purchases of Russian and Chinese aircraft, as well as pressing ex-[[Iraq]]i aircraft into service, and indigenously built aircraft, in order to maintain a capable force. As of June 2019, the Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force possesses 350 fighters, making it the ninth most powerful air arm in the world, as per Global Firepower.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/06/27/iran-s-trying-to-rebuild-its-air-force|title=Iran\u2019s Trying to Rebuild Its Air Force|first=David|last=Axe|date=27 June 2016|publisher=|via=www.thedailybeast.com}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of the Iranian Air Force}}\nThe IRIAF came into being when the former [[Imperial Iranian Air Force]] (IIAF) was renamed following the Islamic Revolution in Iran, in February 1979. The British publishing company Orbis' ''Warplane'' partwork magazine seems to indicate the renaming did not actually take place until after the [[Iran\u2013Iraq War]] had broken out.\n\nThis \"new\" Iranian air force largely inherited the equipment and structure of the former IIAF, even losing most of its leading officers in the course of post-revolutionary chaos, as well as due to the prosecution of those considered as loyal to the Shah, pro-U.S. or elsewhere by the new government in Tehran.\n\nDue to strained relations with the west, Iran had to procure new equipment from [[Brazil]], Russia and the People's Republic of China. Since the Revolution, the exact composition of the IRIAF is hard to determine, but estimates do exist. Many aircraft belonging to the [[Iraqi Air Force]] took refuge in Iran during the [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]] in 1991, and many were put into service with the IRIAF or taken apart for spare parts.\n\nDue to the continuous spare parts shortages faced by the air force, a decision was made in the late 1980s to develop a local aerospace industry to support the air force.\n\nIn 2002, Iran with the co-operation of [[Ukraine]], successfully started the manufacture of the Iran-140; a licence-built version of the [[Antonov]] [[Antonov An-140|An-140]] transport aircraft. Simultaneously, Iran began construction of two domestically produced fighters, upgraded using technology from the [[F-14 Tomcat]] and the [[F-5 Freedom Fighter|F-5 Tiger II]]. The fighters have been named the [[Azarakhsh]] and the [[Shafaq]].\n\nSince then the country has also become self-sufficient in the manufacture of helicopters. The country claims that it is capable of producing the U.S. [[AH-1 Cobra]] gunship. Additionally, Iran also produces [[Bell Helicopter]] [[Bell 212]] and [[Bell 206]] helicopters in serial production. These are known respectively as the [[Shabaviz 2-75]] and the Shabaviz 206.\n\n===Iran\u2013Iraq War (1980\u201388)===\n[[File:C-130 Iran 1988 DN-SN-89-02586.JPEG|thumb|An IRIAF C-130 ''Hercules'' in 1988]]\n\nA series of purges and forced retirements resulted in the manpower of the service being halved between February 1979 and July 1980, leaving the IRIAF ill-prepared for the [[Iran\u2013Iraq War]] (also called the \"1st Persian Gulf War\"). The sudden Iraqi air strikes against eight major Iranian airbases and four other military installations, launched on the afternoon of 22 September 1980, came as a complete surprise and caused a shock in the IRIAF.\n\nThe Iranians retaliated with operation Kaman-99 which involved 206 F-4, F-5 and F-14 aircraft.\n\nOn 23 September 1980, Iran launched [[Operation Kaman 99]] as 40 [[McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II#Armament|F-4 Phantoms, armed with]] [[Mark 82]], Mark 83 and Mark 84 bombs and AGM-65 Maverick missiles, took off from Hamadan. After refueling in mid-air the Phantoms reached the Iraqi capital Baghdad, where they attacked: al-Rashid, [[al-Habbaniyah airbase|al-Habbaniyah ]] and [[al-Kut airbase]]s.\n\nMeanwhile, eight More F-4s took off from Tehran and launched a second attack on the [[al-Rashid airbase]].\n\nIran proceeded to launch 58 F-5E Tiger IIs from Tabriz, which were sent to attack Mosul Airbase. After the attack on Mosul Airbase, another 50 F-5Es were dispatched to strike Nasiriyah Airbase, which was heavily damaged.\n\nAs all 148 Iranian F-4s and F-5s had been sent for a bombing raid on Iraq, 60 F-14 Tomcats were scrambled to defend Iranian airspace against a possible Iraqi retaliation. Iranian F-14s managed to down 2 Iraqi MiG-21s (1 MiG-21RF and 1 MiG-21MF) and 3 Iraqi MiG-23s (MiG-23MS), an Iranian F-5E also shot down an Iraqi Su-20 during the operation. Iraqi MiG-23s managed to down 2 F-5Es, while Iraqi MiG-21s also downed 2 F-5Es. Iraqis also by mistake shot down one of their own Il-76MD strategic airlifters with a SA-3 SAM.\n\nThe Iraqis however were well prepared for the attack and had flown over most of their air force to other Arab countries, such as Saudi Arabia, this made sure that most of the Iraqi Air Force survived the operation.\n\nSaddam Hussein and the Iraqi military were dealt a heavy blow when Iranian Air Force vulnerabilities failed to materialize. All Iraqi airbases near Iran were out of order for weeks and, according to Iran, Iraq's aerial efficiency was reduced by 55%. This allowed Iranians to regroup and prepare for the upcoming Iraqi invasion.\n\nAlthough the readiness rates of the IRIAF significantly increased in the following months, its overall role and influence declined, as the clerical government prioritized resources for the [[Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps]] (IRGC) militias and simultaneously attempted to develop a separate air arm for this service.\n\nAfter the successful liberation of most Iranian areas captured by the Iraqis in the first half of 1982, the situation of the IRIAF changed completely. From an air arm that was offensive by nature, it was largely relegated to air defense and relatively infrequent bombing attacks against targets of industrial and military significance inside Iraq. Simultaneously, the IRIAF had to learn how to maintain and keep operational its large fleet of U.S.-built aircraft and helicopters without outside help, due to American sanctions. Relying primarily on antiquated equipment purchased from the US in the 1970s, the Iranians began establishing their own aerospace industry; their efforts in this remained largely unrecognized until recently.\n\n[[File:Iranian Lockheed P-3F Orion in flight over the Strait of Hormuz on 1 August 1994 (6491410).jpg|thumb|right|A P-3F Orion of the Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force]]\nDuring 1984 and 1985, the IRIAF found itself confronted by an ever-better organized and equipped opponent, as the Iraqi Air force\u2014reinforced by deliveries of advanced fighter-bombers from France and the Soviet Union\u2014launched numerous offensives against Iranian air bases, military bases, industrial infrastructures, powerplants, oil-export hubs, and population centers. These became better known as \"The Tanker War\" and \"The War of the Cities\". To defend against an increasing number of Iraqi air strikes, the IRIAF leaned heavily on its large fleet of Grumman [[F-14 Tomcat]] interceptor fighters. Tomcats were mainly deployed in defense of the strategically important Khark Island (main hub for Iranian oil exports), and Tehran. Over 300 air-to-air engagements against IQAF fighters, fighter-bombers, and bombers, were fought in these areas alone between 1980 and 1988.{{citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n\nConfronted with the fact that it could not obtain replacements for equipment lost in what became a war of attrition against Iraq, the IRIAF remained defense-orientated for the rest of the conflict, conserving its surviving assets as a \"force in being\". From mid 1987, the IRIAF found itself confronted also with U.S. Navy fighters over the Persian Gulf. A number of confrontations that occurred between July 1987 and August 1988 stretched available IRIAF assets to the limit, exhausting its capability to defend Iranian air space against Iraqi air strikes. Despite limitations and sanctions, the IRIAF achieved an extremely successful rate in air to air combat against iraqi jets, to the point that in air to air engagements, Iran\u2019s kill ratio was roughly 5:1, which is only surpassed by the Israelis against Syria in 1982 and the US in the Gulf war in 1991. Very often, air engagements consisted of 1-2 Iranian fighters engaging 4, or even 8 Iraqi fighters and winning. It got to the point where Iraq ordered its pilots to avoid air to air engagements (especially with the F-14).<ref>{{cite book|url=https://kavehfarrokh.com/book-review/books-on-the-history-of-the-iranian-air-force-by-farzad-bishop-and-tom-cooper-2/|title=Iranian F-14 Tomcat Units in Combat (Combat Aurcraft 49)|publisher=Osprey Publishing|year=2004|isbn=978-1841767871|first1=Tom|last1=Cooper|first2=Farzad|last2=Bishop}}</ref> Many other iranian [[ fighter pilots ]] , claimed world records during the war, such as General Yadollah Khalili, who holds the worldwide record of the longest straight flight in a [[ fighter plane ]] , having flown an [[ F-14 ]] non-stop for 11 hours, thus having had to do [[ aerial refuelling ]] 8 times during the process.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6vGT5TByDc</ref> As a result of this war, the [[ IRIAF ]] developed proven tactics and skillful battle tested pilots, thus becoming one of the most experienced air arms in the region.\n\nOne of the most notable [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] fighter pilot was [[Jalil Zandi]]. His fame came as a [[F-14 Tomcat]] [[Aviator|pilot]] ace. He has been reliably credited with shooting down 11 [[Iraq]]i fighter jets. Other notable pilots include [[Shahram Rostami]], [[Hossein Khalatbari]], [[Abbas Doran]], [[Ghafour Jeddi]] and [[Ali Eghbali Dogahe]] among many others.\n\n===Post Iran\u2013Iraq War===\n[[File:Iranian Air Force Hercules Habibi.jpg|thumb|An Iranian [[C-130]] ''Hercules'' in 2010]]\n\nImmediately after the end of the Iran\u2013Iraq War, the IRIAF was partially rebuilt through limited purchases of [[MiG-29]] fighters and [[Su-24]] bombers from the Soviet Union, as well as [[F-7 Skybolt|F-7]]M  and FT-7 fighters from China. While providing needed reinforcement to the Iranian Air Force, these types never replaced the older, U.S.-built F-4 Phantoms, F-14s (the IRIAF is now the only air arm in the world using the fighter), or F-5s. Instead, the IRIAF continued its efforts to keep these types in service, and began a number of projects to refurbish and upgrade them.\n\n===1990s===\nDuring the 1991 [[Persian Gulf War]], numerous Iraqi pilots flew Iraqi Air Force aircraft to Iran to avoid destruction by coalition forces. The Iranians impounded these aircraft and never returned them, putting them in service in the IRIAF<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/381277.stm|work=BBC|title=World: Middle East Iran 'makes own warplane'|date=29 June 1999|access-date=16 March 2020}}</ref> and claiming them as reparations for the Iran\u2013Iraq War. The aircraft included several [[Mirage F1]]s, [[MiG-23]]s, MiG-29s, [[Su-20]]s, [[Su-17|Su-22Ms]], Su-24s, [[Su-25]]s and a number of [[Il-76]]s, including the secret, one-off AEW-AWACS Il-76 \"ADNAN 1\" prototype.\n\nEven after the cease-fire with Iraq, the IRIAF carried out several air raids against [[Kurdish separatism in Iran|Kurdish]] bases in [[Northern Iraq]]. The first of such raids was conducted using eight F-4s armed with rockets and cluster bombs on 6 April 1992 against [[People's Mujahedin of Iran]]'s [[Camp Ashraf]]. During this event one F-4 was shot down by either insurgent or Iraqi military AAA and both pilots (Lt. Col Amini and Cpt. Sharifi) were captured and not freed until 1998. Despite threats of response, Iraq wasn't able to retaliate due to its own fight against Kurdish separatist guerrillas and the [[Iraqi no-fly zones|Western-imposed no-fly zones]] that crippled and limited its air force's operations.<ref name=\"nytimes\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/06/world/iran-strafes-rebels-in-iraq-jet-downed.html|title=Iran Strafes Rebels in Iraq - Jet Downed|work=The New York Times|accessdate=2015-02-07}}</ref><ref name=\"ejection-history\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ejection-history.org.uk/Country-By-Country/iranian_f_4_phantom_losses.htm|title=iranian_F_4_Phantom_LOSSES|publisher=ejection-history.org.uk|accessdate=2015-02-07|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150710211447/http://www.ejection-history.org.uk/country-by-country/iranian_f_4_phantom_losses.htm|archivedate=2015-07-10}}</ref>\n\nIn 2007, Iraq asked Iran to return some of the scores of Iraqi fighter plans that flew there ahead of the Gulf War in 1991.<ref name=\"reuters.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iraq-airforce-idUSCOL54415720070805|title=Iraq air force wants Iran to give back its planes|date=5 August 2007|publisher=|via=www.reuters.com}}</ref> And as of 2014, Iran was receptive to the demands and was working on refurbishing an unspecified number of jets.<ref name=\"scmp.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.scmp.com/news/world/article/1542427/new-us-planes-slow-arrive-iraq-seeks-remnants-saddams-air-force-bomb-isil|title=With new US planes slow to arrive, Iraq seeks remnants of Saddam's air force to bomb ISIL|date=28 June 2014|website=South China Morning Post}}</ref><ref name=\"washingtonpost.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2014/06/27/be172f43-cf98-4677-8e6d-4d64a5ae5e1d_story.html|title=Iraq cobbling together makeshift air force to fight ISIS|first=Loveday|last=Morris|date=27 June 2014|access-date=16 March 2020|work=The Washington Post}}</ref> In late 2014, Iran returned 130 military aircraft to Iraq.<ref name=\"middleeastmonitor.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20140623-iran-returns-military-aircraft-to-iraq-after-20-years/|title=Iran returns military aircraft to Iraq after 20 years|date=23 June 2014|website=Middle East Monitor}}</ref>\n\n===2000s===\nIn 2006, after Iranian media published a series of reports suggesting that [[Venezuela]] was interested in selling its 21 [[F-16 Fighting Falcon]]s to Iran,<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090216034033/http://www.aftabnews.ir/vdciwwa5.t1a5z2bcct.html \u0686\u0627\u0648\u0632: \u062c\u0646\u06af\u0646\u062f\u0647 \u0647\u0627\u06cc \u0627\u0641 \u2013 \u06f1\u06f6 \u0631\u0627 \u0627\u062d\u062a\u0645\u0627\u0644\u0627 \u0628\u0647 \u0627\u06cc\u0631\u0627\u0646 \u0645\u06cc \u0641\u0631\u0648\u0634\u06cc\u0645] (Aftab News)</ref> a [[Hugo Chavez]] adviser confirmed to the [[Associated Press]] that \"Venezuela's military is considering selling its fleet of U.S.-made F-16 fighter jets to another country, possibly Iran, in response to a U.S. ban on arms sales to President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez's government\".

A video released by [[Aljazeera]] seemed to show an Iranian [[F-4 Phantom II]] bombing some [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIS]] buildings in [[Diyala Governorate]].<ref>[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/12/01/us-iran-iraq_n_6251894.html Iran Bombing Islamic State In Iraq, U.S. Official Confirms] ''[[Huffington Post]]''</ref>\n\n==Current composition==\nThe IRIAF composition has changed very little since 1979. The first, limited re-location of several units\u2014including disbandment of some and establishment of new squadrons\u2014occurred in late 1980, when the F-4D fleet was concentrated at Shiraz, two squadrons of F-4Es moved from Shiraz to Hamedan, and a squadron of F-14 Tomcats deployed to Mehrabad. Other deployments during the war with Iraq were mainly of temporary character, even if a major re-organization of existing air-defense assets\u2014foremost SAM and AAA units\u2014was undertaken in 1985. There has been no major re-organization during all of the 1990s, either.\n\n[[File:HESA Azarakhsh displayed in Vahdati Airbase.jpg|thumb|left|HESA Azarakhsh]]\nEquipment, capabilities, and combat performance of the IRIAF strongly influenced the development of the Iraqi Air Force (IQAF), during the 1980s, but also that of the [[United Arab Emirates Air Force]], in the 1990s and the most recent times.\n\nIn 2013, Iran changed the status of its airports and former Tac Air Bases in combined airfields according to its current policy of having limited fixed units stationed as IRIAF's new policy is using composite units. These composite units may be stationed at any airfield and may be moved overnight to any other airfield at short notice. Therefore, all combined airfields are or will be accommodated with basic cross-service capabilities to handle all IRIAF aircraft.\n\nWhile Iran has been under sanctions since 1979 and these sanctions have become more intense after the country started its nuclear program, Iran has become one of only a handful of countries capable of servicing and overhauling its own military and civilian aircraft. However, less tension in the current (2015) international situation led to a decrease of the sanctions, and the Iranian government is now capable again in ordering a new fleet of civilian aircraft replacing the aged types.\n\n[[File:Mirage F1BQ of IRIAF.jpg|thumb|A Mirage F1BQ landing]]\n[[File:Iran Air Force Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-29UB Sharifi.jpg|thumb|A MiG-29UB of the Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force in 2011.]]\n[[File:A Sukhoi Su-24MK of IRIAF flighting over Shiraz.jpg|thumb|right|An Su-24MK of the IRIAF flying over Shahid Dastghaib International Airport.]]\n\n===Jane's Sentinel estimate of units 1993===\n''Source: Jane's Sentinel, Islamic Republic of Iran, 1993, p.&nbsp;27 \u2013 not complete''\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Tactical Air Base\n!Location\n!Type\n!Unit\n|-\n|TAB 1\n|[[Mehrabad International Airport|Mehrabad]]\n|F-5E\n|squadron\n|-\n|\n|Mehrabad\n|F-7M\n|squadron\n|-\n|\n|Mehrabad\n|F-14A/MiG-29\n|squadron\n|-\n|\n|Mehrabad\n|C-130H/Il-76\n|squadron\n|-\n|\n|Mehrabad\n|F 27/Falcom\n|squadron\n|-\n|TAB 2\n|[[Tabriz Air Base|Tabriz]]\n|F-4D/E\n|squadron\n|-\n|\n|Tabriz\n|[[F-5E]]\n|squadron\n|-\n|\n|Tabriz\n|F-7M\n|squadron\n|-\n|\n|Tabriz\n|[[C-130]]H\n|flight\n|-\n|TAB 3\n|[[Hamadan Air Base|Hamadan]]\n|F-6\n|squadron\n|-\n|\n|Hamadan\n|F-7M\n|squadron\n|-\n|TAB 4\n|[[Dezful Air Base|Dezful]]\n|F-4D/E\n|squadron\n|-\n|TAB 4\n|Dezful\n|F-5E\n|squadron\n|-\n|TAB 5\n|not identified\n|\n|\n|-\n|TAB 6\n|[[Bushehr Air Base|Bushehr]]\n|[[F-4 Phantom II|F-4D/E]]\n|squadron\n|-\n|\n|Bushehr\n|[[Chengdu J-7|F-7M]]\n|flight\n|-\n|\n|Bushehr\n|[[C-130]]H\n|flight\n|-\n|TAB 7\n|[[Shiraz Air Base|Shiraz]]\n|[[Northrop F-5]]\n|squadron\n|-\n|\n|Shiraz\n|[[F-14]]A/[[MiG-29]]\n|squadron\n|-\n|\n|Shiraz\n|[[C-130]]H/[[Il-76]]\n|squadron\n|-\n|\n|Shiraz\n|[[Fokker F27 Friendship|F-27]]\n|flight\n|}\n* 71 ASW Squadron ([[Lockheed P-3 Orion]]) Shiraz\n\n==Alleged purchases==\n\n===Su-30===\nIt is reported that Israeli defense officials were investigating a potential Iran\u2013Russia deal, in which Iran would pay $1&nbsp;billion for a dozen squadrons\u2019 worth of Su-30 jets.<ref name=\"globalsecurity.org\">{{cite web|author=John Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/iran/airforce.htm |title=Iran Air Force |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |date= |accessdate=2013-04-22}}</ref> Iran and Russia have both denied this and have rejected these claims as propaganda.<ref>[[DEBKAfile]] [http://www.debka.com/headline.php?hid=4449 DEBKA Reports: Iran buys 250 long-distance Sukhoi fighter-bombers, 20 fuel tankers, from Russia] 1 August 2007</ref><ref>''Navy Times'' [http://www.navytimes.com/news/2007/07/navy_iran_fighters_070730w/ Reports: Iran may buy 250 jets from Russia] 1 August 2007</ref><ref>defensetech [http://www.defensetech.org/archives/003636.html Iran's New Fighter?] 2 August 2007</ref> In a broadcast the Mehr News Agency reported that they (the reporters) saw a dozen Su-30s in a maneuver that took place on 15 and 16 September 2008; further the report reads: \"In this joint maneuver of the IRIAF and the AFAGIR which is called the 'Guardians of the Nations Skies' the Air Forces of Iran have tested domestically developed systems as well as newly purchased systems (from Russia and China).\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mehrnews.com/fa/newsdetail.aspx?NewsID=751789 |title=Iran, world, political, sport, economic news and headlines |publisher=MehrNews.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-22}}</ref>\n\n===J-10===\nThe Russian news agency [[RIA Novosti|Novosti]] reported that ''Business & Financial Markets'' said Iran has signed a deal with China to buy two squadrons/24 of [[Chengdu J-10|J-10]] fighter planes with Russian-made [[AL-31]]FN engines.

Some of these facilities have since seen full-scale deployments of IRIAF units, and it now appears that at least two became permanent \"Tactical Fighter Bases\" (TFBs). These are the first such bases established since 1979. Except new airfields, with Chinese support, the IRIAF constructed also a number of new early warning radar sites around the country. Its ability to control the national airspace, however, remains limited\u2014mainly due to the rugged terrain and lack of airborne early warning assets.\n\nAside from maintaining 14 TFBs, the IRIAF operates numerous temporary detachments on several minor airfields around the country. Ex-Iraqi Mirage F.1EQs, usually based at TFB.14, near Mashhad, were frequently seen over the Persian Gulf, in 2005 and 2006.\n\n==Missiles and rockets==\n[[File:Fakour-90 missile.jpg|thumb|[[Fakour-90]] missile (yellow) on display at the Eqtedar-40 defence exhibition]]\nOn 8 March 2009, Iran declared that it has successfully armed some of its front-line fighter jets with domestically manufactured long-range [[air-to-surface missiles]], which are capable of hitting targets within a range of more than 110 kilometers at sea.<ref>[http://www.presstv.ir/detail.aspx?id=87932&sectionid=351020101 Iranian jets will fire long-range missiles], [[PressTV]], Retrieved on 8 March 2009.</ref>\n\n==Major operations==\n* [[Iran\u2013Iraq War]]\n** [[Operation Kaman 99]], Iran's biggest air raid during Iran\u2013Iraq war with a strength of more than 140 aircraft.\n** [[Operation Scorch Sword]] An Iranian airstrike on an Iraqi nuclear reactor under construction.\n** [[H-3 airstrike]], IRIAF's boldest operation in Iraq\n** [[Operation Pearl]], a successful joint operation by Iranian air force and navy in Persian Gulf against the Iraqi air force and navy.\n** [[Operation Sultan 10]], an operation to disturb delivery and training of new French fighter planes to Iraqi airforce during the Iran\u2013Iraq war.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Flying ace]]\n* [[F-14 Tomcat operational history]]\n* [[Iranian aerial victories during the Iran\u2013Iraq war]]\n* [[Iraqi aerial victories during the Iran\u2013Iraq war]]\n* [[List of aces of aces]]\n\n==References==\n;Notes\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Air force of Iran}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20160507132820/http://nahaja.aja.ir/Portal/Home/ Official site of the Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force]\n* [http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/iran/airforce.htm Globalsecurity.org]\n\n{{Iran Military}}\n{{air forces}}\n{{NAHAJA Commanders}}\n{{IIAF Commanders}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Islamic Republic Of Iran Air Force}}\n[[Category:Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force| ]]\n[[Category:Military units and formations established in 1979]]\n[[Category:1979 establishments in Iran]]\n", "name_user": "Rodw", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguating links toIRIAF(link removed) usingDisamAssist.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_Republic_of_Iran_Air_Force"}

His \"highly provisional\" estimate (see right) relies on a [[Roman economy#Demography|low-count]] of the Roman population of only 44 million at the time of the death of [[Augustus]] in 14 AD. [[Italia (Roman Empire)|Italia]] is considered to have been the richest region, due to tax transfers from the [[Roman province|provinces]] and the concentration of elite income in the heartland; its NDI per capita is estimated at having been between 40%<ref name=\"Lo Cascio, Malanima 2009, 391\u2013401\"/> and 66%<ref name=\"Maddison 2007, pp. 47\u201351\"/> higher than in the rest of the empire. Besides Italy, the wealthiest province was [[Egypt (Roman province)|Egypt]], in terms of NDI per capita.<ref>Maddison 2007, p. 55, table 1.14</ref>\n\nThe European NDI per capita was higher than in the Asian and African provinces if Italy is included, but without it, the rest of Europe had a lower NDI per capita than the Asian and African provinces.<ref name=\"Maddison 2007, 54, table 1.12\"/> The [[Hellenistic]] Eastern provinces ([[Roman Greece|Greece]], [[Asia (Roman province)|Asia Minor]], [[Roman Syria|Syria]], Egypt) were about 20% wealthier than their mostly Latin-speaking Western counterparts, with Egypt alone being about 28% wealthier. However, Italia, which was not administered as a province, enjoyed a higher per capita income than any one of them.<ref>Maddison 2007, p. 57, table 1.14</ref>\n\n===Taxation===\nTaxation under the Empire amounted to about 5% of the Empire's [[Roman gross domestic product|gross product]].<ref name=\"m183\">[[Roman Empire#Morris|Morris]], p. 183.</ref> The typical tax rate paid by individuals ranged from 2 to 5%.<ref name=\"Ando p. 187\">[[#Potter2009|Potter (2009)]], p. 187.</ref> The tax code was \"bewildering\" in its complicated system of [[direct taxation|direct]] and [[indirect taxes]], some paid in cash and some [[barter|in kind]]. Taxes might be specific to a province, or kinds of properties such as [[fishery|fisheries]] or [[salt evaporation pond]]s; they might be in effect for a limited time.<ref>[[#Potter2009|Potter (2009)]], pp. 185\u2013187.</ref> Tax collection was justified by the need to maintain the military,<ref name=\"Hopkins p. 184\">[[#Morris|Morris]], p. 184.</ref><ref>[[#Potter2009|Potter (2009)]], p. 185</ref> and taxpayers sometimes got a refund if the army captured a surplus of booty.<ref>[[#Potter2009|Potter (2009)]], p. 185.</ref> In-kind taxes were accepted from less-[[monetization|monetized]] areas, particularly those who could supply grain or goods to army camps.<ref name=\"administration188\">[[#Potter2009|Potter (2009)]], p. 188.</ref>\n\n[[File:Nile river02 pushkin.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Personification of the River Nile and his children, from the [[Serapeum|Temple of Serapis and Isis]] in Rome (1st century AD)]]\nThe primary source of direct tax revenue was individuals, who paid a [[Tax per head|poll tax]] and a tax on their land, construed as a tax on its produce or productive capacity.<ref name=\"Ando p. 187\"/> Supplemental forms could be filed by those eligible for certain exemptions; for example, Egyptian farmers could register fields as fallow and tax-exempt depending on flood patterns of the [[Nile]].<ref name=\"Ando p. 186\">[[#Potter2009|Potter (2009)]], p. 186.</ref> Tax obligations were determined by the census, which required each head of household to appear before the presiding official and provide a head count of his household, as well as an accounting of property he owned that was suitable for agriculture or habitation.<ref name=\"Ando p. 186\"/>\n\nA major source of indirect-tax revenue was the ''portoria'', customs and tolls on imports and exports, including among provinces.<ref name=\"Ando p. 187\"/> Special taxes were levied on the slave trade. Towards the end of his reign, Augustus instituted a 4% tax on the sale of slaves,<ref>[[Cassius Dio]] 55.31.4.</ref> which Nero shifted from the purchaser to the dealers, who responded by raising their prices.<ref>[[Tacitus]], ''Annales'' 13.31.2.</ref> An owner who manumitted a slave paid a \"freedom tax\", calculated at 5% of value.<ref>This was the ''vicesima libertatis,'' \"the twentieth for freedom\"; [[#Potter2009|Potter (2009)]], p. 187.</ref>\n\nAn [[inheritance tax]] of 5% was assessed when Roman citizens above a certain net worth left property to anyone but members of their immediate family. Revenues from the estate tax and from a 1% sales tax on auctions went towards the veterans' pension fund ''([[aerarium militare]])''.<ref name=\"Ando p. 187\"/>\n\nLow taxes helped the Roman aristocracy increase their wealth, which equalled or exceeded the revenues of the central government. An emperor sometimes replenished his treasury by confiscating the estates of the \"super-rich\", but in the later period, the [[tax resistance|resistance]] of the wealthy to paying taxes was one of the factors contributing to the collapse of the Empire.<ref name=\"Hopkins p. 184\"/>\n\n==State revenues==\n\nWith the conclusion of the [[Third Mithridatic War]] in 63 BC, the [[Roman Republic]] now incorporated the [[Kingdom of Pontus]], [[Cilicia]], most of [[Syria]], and the island of [[Crete]] into its growing dominion, as well as turning the [[Hasmonean dynasty|Kingdom of Judea]] into a [[client state]].<ref name=\"mclaughlin 2014 p6\"/> The Roman historian [[Plutarch]] records that after [[Pompey]]'s return to Rome as a renowned conqueror of [[Eastern Mediterranean|the east]], tablets were presented showing that state revenues had increased from 50 million [[denarii]] to 85 million, an increase from 200 to 340 million [[sesterces]] from new taxes levied.<ref name=\"mclaughlin 2014 p6\">Raoul McLaughlin (2014).

Both [[Cicero]] and [[Strabo]] related how at the beginning of the reign of [[Ptolemy XII Auletes]] (80-51 BC) his kingdom received an annual revenue of 12,500 [[Talent (measurement)|talents]], the equivalent of 75 million denarii, or 300 million sesterces.<ref name=\"mclaughlin 2014 p6\"/> Hence, with the Roman conquest of Egypt in the [[Final War of the Roman Republic]] (32-30 BC) and transformation of Egypt into a [[Roman province]], one would readily assume a considerable increase in state revenues was made. The revenues garnered in Egypt in 80 BC alone was seven times the amount of tax money contemporary [[Roman Gaul]] offered to the Roman coffers following its conquest by [[Julius Caesar]], a mere 40 million sesterces.<ref name=\"mclaughlin 2014 p6\"/> Yet this was roughly the same amount of taxes Rome was able to levy from Egypt (i.e. 40 million sesterces) after its conquest by [[Octavian]], bringing the total figure for state revenues up to 420 million (which included 40 million from newly conquered Egypt, 40 million from Gaul, and 340 million from all other provinces).<ref>Raoul McLaughlin (2014).

''Aircraft'' includes [[airplane|fixed-wing]] and [[helicopter|rotary-wing]] types, morphable wings, wing-less lifting bodies, as well as [[aerostat|lighter-than-air craft]] such as [[Balloon (aeronautics)|hot air balloons]] and [[airship]]s.\n\nAviation began in the 18th century with the development of the [[hot air balloon]], an apparatus capable of atmospheric displacement through [[buoyancy]]. Some of the most significant advancements in aviation technology came with the controlled gliding flying of [[Otto Lilienthal]] in 1896; then a large step in significance came with the construction of the first powered airplane by the [[Wright brothers]] in the early 1900s. Since that time, aviation has been technologically revolutionized by the introduction of the [[jet aircraft|jet]] which permitted a major form of transport throughout the world.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word ''aviation'' was coined by the French writer and former naval officer Gabriel La Landelle in 1863.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/bub_gb_pA9-D4QETAoC#page/n7/mode/2up|title=Aviation ou Navigation aerienne par G. de La Landelle}}</ref> He derived the term from the verb ''avier'' (an unsuccessful [[neologism]] for \"to fly\"), itself derived from the Latin word ''avis'' (\"bird\") and the suffix ''-ation''.{{sfn|Cassard|2008|p=77}}\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of aviation}}\n\n===Early beginnings===\n\nThere are early legends of human flight such as the stories of [[Icarus]] in Greek myth, [[Jamshid]] and [[Shah]] [[Kay K\u0101vus]] in Persian myth,<ref>''The Sh\u00e1hn\u00e1ma of Firdaus\u00ed''.

Ltd</ref> and the flying automaton of [[Archytas]] of [[Taranto|Tarentum]] (428\u2013347 BC).{{sfn|Berliner|1996|p=28}} Later, somewhat more credible claims of short-distance human flights appear, such as the winged flights of [[Abbas ibn Firnas]] (810\u2013887), [[Eilmer of Malmesbury]] (11th century), and the hot-air Passarola of [[Bartholomeu Louren\u00e7o de Gusm\u00e3o]] (1685\u20131724).\n\n===Lighter than air===\n[[File:Hindenburg at lakehurst.jpg|thumb|[[LZ 129 Hindenburg]] at [[Lakehurst Naval Air Station]], 1936]]\nThe modern age of aviation began with the first untethered human lighter-than-air flight on November 21, 1783, of a [[hot air balloon]] designed by the [[Montgolfier brothers]]. The practicality of balloons was limited because they could only travel downwind. It was immediately recognized that a steerable, or [[Airship|dirigible]], balloon was required. [[Jean-Pierre Blanchard]] flew the first human-powered dirigible in 1784 and crossed the English Channel in one in 1785.\n\n[[Rigid airship]]s became the first aircraft to transport passengers and cargo over great distances. The best known aircraft of this type were manufactured by the German [[Zeppelin]] company.\n\nThe most successful Zeppelin was the [[LZ 127 Graf Zeppelin|Graf Zeppelin]]. It flew over one million miles, including an around-the-world flight in August 1929. However, the dominance of the Zeppelins over the airplanes of that period, which had a range of only a few hundred miles, was diminishing as airplane design advanced. The \"Golden Age\" of the airships ended on May 6, 1937 when the [[LZ 129 Hindenburg|Hindenburg]] caught fire, killing 36 people. The cause of the Hindenburg accident was initially blamed on the use of hydrogen instead of helium as the lift gas. An internal investigation by the manufacturer revealed that the coating used in the material covering the frame was highly flammable and allowed static electricity to build up in the airship.{{sfn|De Angelis|1997|pages=87\u2013101}} Changes to the coating formulation reduced the risk of further Hindenburg type accidents.

One of the most successful designs of this period was the [[Douglas DC-3]], which became the first [[airliner]] to be profitable carrying passengers exclusively, starting the modern era of passenger airline service. By the beginning of World War II, many towns and cities had built airports, and there were numerous qualified pilots available. The war brought many innovations to aviation, including the first [[turbojet|jet]] aircraft and the first liquid-fueled [[rocket]]s.\n\n[[File:Helios cthomas.jpg|thumb|left|[[NASA]]'s [[Helios Prototype|Helios]] researches [[solar power]]ed flight.]]\nAfter World War II, especially in North America, there was a boom in [[general aviation]], both private and commercial, as thousands of pilots were released from military service and many inexpensive war-surplus transport and training aircraft became available. Manufacturers such as [[Cessna]], [[Piper Aircraft|Piper]], and [[Beechcraft]] expanded production to provide light aircraft for the new middle-class market.\n\nBy the 1950s, the development of civil jets grew, beginning with the [[de Havilland Comet]], though the first widely used passenger jet was the [[Boeing 707]], because it was much more economical than other aircraft at that time. At the same time, [[gas turbine|turboprop]] propulsion began to appear for smaller commuter planes, making it possible to serve small-volume routes in a much wider range of weather conditions.\n\nSince the 1960s [[composite material]] airframes and quieter, more efficient engines have become available, and [[Concorde]] provided [[supersonic transport|supersonic passenger service]] for more than two decades, but the most important lasting innovations have taken place in instrumentation and control. The arrival of [[transistor|solid-state]] electronics, the [[Global Positioning System]], [[communications satellite|satellite communications]], and increasingly small and powerful computers and [[light-emitting diode|LED]] displays, have dramatically changed the cockpits of [[airliner]]s and, increasingly, of smaller aircraft as well. Pilots can navigate much more accurately and view terrain, obstructions, and other nearby aircraft on a map or through [[synthetic vision]], even at night or in low visibility.\n\nOn June 21, 2004, [[SpaceShipOne]] became the first privately funded aircraft to make a [[spaceflight]], opening the possibility of an aviation market capable of leaving the Earth's atmosphere. Meanwhile, flying prototypes of aircraft powered by alternative fuels, such as [[ethanol]], [[electricity]], and even [[solar energy]], are becoming more common.\n\n==Operations of aircraft==\n\n===Civil aviation===\n{{Main|Civil aviation}} \nCivil aviation includes all non-military flying, both [[general aviation]] and [[scheduled air transport]].\n\n====Air transport====\n{{Main|Airline}}\n[[File:Northwest Airlines A330-323 (N805NW) landing at London Gatwick Airport.jpg|thumb|right|[[Northwest Airlines]] [[Airbus A330|Airbus A330-323]]]]\n\nThere are five major manufacturers of civil transport aircraft (in alphabetical order):\n* [[Airbus]], based in Europe\n* [[Boeing]], based in the United States\n* [[Bombardier Aerospace|Bombardier]], based in Canada\n* [[Embraer]], based in Brazil\n* [[United Aircraft Corporation]], based in Russia\n\nBoeing, Airbus, [[Ilyushin]] and [[Tupolev]] concentrate on wide-body and narrow-body jet [[airliner]]s, while Bombardier, Embraer and [[Sukhoi]] concentrate on [[regional airliner]]s.

Since then, [[open skies]] agreements have resulted in increased competition and choice for consumers, coupled with falling prices for airlines. The combination of high fuel prices, low fares, high salaries, and crises such as the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] and the [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome|SARS epidemic]] have driven many older airlines to government-bailouts, bankruptcy or mergers. At the same time, [[low-cost carrier]]s such as [[Ryanair]], [[Southwest Airlines|Southwest]] and [[WestJet]] have flourished.\n\n====General aviation====\n{{Main|General aviation}}\n[[File:cessna.120.g-btbw.arp.jpg|thumb|right|1947 [[Cessna 120]]]]\n\n''General aviation'' includes all non-scheduled civil flying, both [[private aviation|private]] and [[commercial aviation|commercial]]. General aviation may include business flights, [[air charter]], private aviation, flight training, [[hot air balloon|ballooning]], [[paragliding]], [[parachuting]], [[Glider (sailplane)|gliding]], [[hang gliding]], [[aerial photography]], [[powered hang glider|foot-launched powered hang gliders]], air ambulance, crop dusting, charter flights, [[traffic reporting]], police air patrols and forest fire fighting.\n\nEach country regulates aviation differently, but general aviation usually falls under different regulations depending on whether it is private or commercial and on the type of equipment involved.\n\nMany small aircraft manufacturers serve the general aviation market, with a focus on private aviation and flight training.\n\nThe most important recent developments for small aircraft (which form the bulk of the GA fleet) have been the introduction of advanced [[avionics]] (including [[Global Positioning System|GPS]]) that were formerly found only in large [[airliner]]s, and the introduction of [[composite material]]s to make small aircraft lighter and faster. [[Ultralight aviation|Ultralight]] and [[homebuilt aircraft]] have also become increasingly popular for recreational use, since in most countries that allow private aviation, they are much less expensive and less heavily regulated than certified aircraft.\n\n===Military aviation===\n{{Main|Military aviation|Aerial warfare}}\nSimple [[balloon (aeronautics)|balloons]] were used as surveillance aircraft as early as the 18th century. Over the years, [[military aircraft]] have been built to meet ever increasing capability requirements. Manufacturers of military aircraft compete for contracts to supply their government's arsenal. Aircraft are selected based on factors like cost, performance, and the speed of production.\n[[File:Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird.jpg|thumb|The [[Lockheed SR-71]] remains unsurpassed in many areas of performance.]]\n\n====Types of military aviation====\n* [[Fighter aircraft]]'s primary function is to destroy other aircraft. (e.g. [[Sopwith Camel]], [[A6M Zero]], [[McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle|F-15]], [[MiG-29]], [[Su-27]], and [[F-22]]).\n* [[Ground attack|Ground attack aircraft]] are used against [[Tactical bombing|tactical]] earth-bound targets. (e.g. [[Junkers Ju 87|Junkers Stuka]], [[A-10 Thunderbolt II|A-10]], [[Ilyushin Il-2|Il-2]], [[J-22 Orao]], [[AH-64]] and [[Sukhoi Su-25|Su-25]]).\n* [[Bomber]]s are generally used against more [[Strategic bombing|strategic]] targets, such as factories and oil fields. (e.g. [[Zeppelin]], [[Tu-95]], [[Dassault Mirage IV|Mirage IV]], and [[B-52 Stratofortress|B-52]]).\n* [[Military transport aircraft|Transport aircraft]] are used to transport hardware and personnel. (e.g. [[C-17 Globemaster III]], [[C-130 Hercules]] and [[Mil Mi-26]]).\n* [[Surveillance aircraft|Surveillance]] and [[Aerial reconnaissance|reconnaissance]] aircraft obtain information about enemy forces. (e.g. [[Rumpler Taube]], [[de Havilland Mosquito|Mosquito]], [[Lockheed U-2|U-2]], [[Bell OH-58 Kiowa|OH-58]] and [[MiG-25R]]).\n* [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)]] are used primarily as reconnaissance fixed-wing aircraft, though many also carry payloads. Cargo aircraft are in development.  (e.g. [[RQ-7|RQ-7B Shadow]], [[MQ-8|MQ-8 Fire Scout]], and [[MQ-1C|MQ-1C Gray Eagle]]).\n* [[Missile]]s deliver warheads, normally explosives, but also things like leaflets.\n\n=== Air safety ===\n{{main|Aviation safety}}\nAviation safety means the state of an aviation system or organization in which risks associated with aviation activities, related to, or in direct support of the operation of aircraft, are reduced and controlled to an acceptable level. It encompasses the theory, practice, investigation, and categorization of flight failures, and the prevention of such failures through regulation, education, and training. It can also be applied in the context of campaigns that inform the public as to the safety of air travel.\n\n==Aviation accidents and incidents==\n{{main|Aviation accidents and incidents}}\n[[File:crash.arp.600pix.jpg|thumb|right|upright|A [[United States Air Force Thunderbirds|USAF Thunderbird]] pilot [[Ejection seat|ejecting]] from his [[F-16]] aircraft at an [[air show]] in 2003]]\n\nAn ''aviation accident'' is defined by the [[Convention on International Civil Aviation]] Annex 13 as an occurrence associated with the operation of an aircraft which takes place between the time any person boards the aircraft with the intention of flight until such time as all such persons have disembarked, in which a person is fatally or seriously injured, the aircraft sustains damage or structural failure or the aircraft is missing or is completely inaccessible.<ref>{{cite web|author=The Investigation Process Research Resource Site|title=International Investigation Standards|url=http://www.iprr.org/manuals/Annex13.html|accessdate=7 May 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120427102210/http://www.iprr.org/manuals/Annex13.html|archivedate=27 April 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe first fatal aviation accident occurred in a [[Wright Model A]] aircraft at [[Fort Myer|Fort Myer, Virginia, USA]], on September 17, 1908, resulting in injury to the pilot, [[Orville Wright]], and death of the passenger, Signal Corps Lieutenant [[Thomas Selfridge]].<ref>{{cite web|author=About.com Inventors|title=Wright Brothers \u2013 First Fatal Airplane Crash in 1908|url=http://inventors.about.com/od/weirdmuseums/ig/Wright-Brothers/First-Fatal-Airplane-Crash.htm|accessdate=7 May 2012}}</ref>\n\nAn ''aviation incident'' is defined as an occurrence, other than an accident, associated with the operation of an aircraft that affects or could affect the safety of operations.<ref name=\"AirSafe.com\">{{cite web|last=AirSafe.com|title=Definitions of Key Terms Used by AirSafe.com|url=http://www.airsafe.com/events/define.htm|accessdate=7 May 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120420172922/http://www.airsafe.com/events/define.htm|archivedate=20 April 2012}}</ref>\n\nAn accident in which the damage to the aircraft is such that it must be written off, or in which the plane is destroyed, is called a ''hull loss accident''.<ref name=\"AirSafe.com\"/>\n\n==Air traffic control==\n{{Main|Air traffic control}}\n[[File:Towers Schiphol small.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Air traffic control tower]]s at [[Amsterdam Airport]]]]\n\nAir traffic control (ATC) involves communication with aircraft to help maintain separation&nbsp;\u2013 that is, they ensure that aircraft are sufficiently far enough apart horizontally or vertically for no risk of collision. Controllers may co-ordinate position reports provided by pilots, or in high traffic areas (such as the United States) they may use [[radar]] to see aircraft positions.\n\nThere are generally four different types of ATC:\n* center controllers, who control aircraft en route between airports\n* control towers (including tower, ground control, clearance delivery, and other services), which control aircraft within a small distance (typically 10\u201315&nbsp;km horizontal, and 1,000 m vertical) of an airport.\n* oceanic controllers, who control aircraft over international waters between continents, generally without radar service.\n* terminal controllers, who control aircraft in a wider area (typically 50\u201380&nbsp;km) around busy airports.\n\nATC is especially important for aircraft flying under [[instrument flight rules]] (IFR), when they may be in weather conditions that do not allow the pilots to see other aircraft. However, in very high-traffic areas, especially near major airports, aircraft flying under [[visual flight rules]] (VFR) are also required to follow instructions from ATC.\n\nIn addition to separation from other aircraft, ATC may provide weather advisories, terrain separation, navigation assistance, and other services to pilots, depending on their workload.\n\nATC do not control all flights. The majority of VFR (Visual Flight Rules) flights in North America are not required to contact ATC (unless they are passing through a busy terminal area or using a major airport), and in many areas, such as northern Canada and low altitude in northern Scotland, Air traffic control services are not available even for IFR flights at lower altitudes.\n\n==Environmental impact==\n{{Main|Environmental impact of aviation}}\n\nLike all activities involving [[combustion]], operating powered aircraft (from airliners to hot air balloons) releases [[soot]] and other pollutants into the atmosphere. [[Greenhouse gas]]es such as [[carbon dioxide]] (CO<sub>2</sub>) are also produced. In addition, there are environmental impacts specific to aviation: for instance, [[File:Contrails.jpg|thumb|Water vapor [[Condensation trails|contrails]] left by high-altitude jet [[airliner]]s.

Some of the most significant advancements in aviation technology came with the controlled gliding flying of [[Otto Lilienthal]] in 1896; then a large step in significance came with the construction of the first powered airplane by the [[Wright brothers]] in the early 1900s. Since that time, aviation has been technologically revolutionized by the introduction of the [[jet aircraft|jet]] which permitted a major form of transport throughout the world.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word ''aviation'' was coined by the French writer and former naval officer Gabriel La Landelle in 1863.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/bub_gb_pA9-D4QETAoC#page/n7/mode/2up|title=Aviation ou Navigation aerienne par G. de La Landelle}}</ref> He derived the term from the verb ''avier'' (an unsuccessful [[neologism]] for \"to fly\"), itself derived from the Latin word ''avis'' (\"bird\") and the suffix ''-ation''.{{sfn|Cassard|2008|p=77}}\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of aviation}}\n\n===Early beginnings===\n\nThere are early legends of human flight such as the stories of [[Icarus]] in Greek myth, [[Jamshid]] and [[Shah]] [[Kay K\u0101vus]] in Persian myth,<ref>''The Sh\u00e1hn\u00e1ma of Firdaus\u00ed''.

The practicality of balloons was limited because they could only travel downwind. It was immediately recognized that a steerable, or [[Airship|dirigible]], balloon was required. [[Jean-Pierre Blanchard]] flew the first human-powered dirigible in 1784 and crossed the English Channel in one in 1785.\n\n[[Rigid airship]]s became the first aircraft to transport passengers and cargo over great distances. The best known aircraft of this type were manufactured by the German [[Zeppelin]] company.\n\nThe most successful Zeppelin was the [[LZ 127 Graf Zeppelin|Graf Zeppelin]]. It flew over one million miles, including an around-the-world flight in August 1929. However, the dominance of the Zeppelins over the airplanes of that period, which had a range of only a few hundred miles, was diminishing as airplane design advanced. The \"Golden Age\" of the airships ended on May 6, 1937 when the [[LZ 129 Hindenburg|Hindenburg]] caught fire, killing 36 people. The cause of the Hindenburg accident was initially blamed on the use of hydrogen instead of helium as the lift gas. An internal investigation by the manufacturer revealed that the coating used in the material covering the frame was highly flammable and allowed static electricity to build up in the airship.{{sfn|De Angelis|1997|pages=87\u2013101}} Changes to the coating formulation reduced the risk of further Hindenburg type accidents. Although there have been periodic initiatives to revive their use, airships have seen only niche application since that time.\n\n===Heavier than air===\nIn 1799, Sir [[George Cayley]] set forth the concept of the modern airplane as a fixed-wing flying machine with separate systems for lift, propulsion, and control.<ref>{{cite web\n |title       = Aviation History\n |url         = http://www.aviation-history.com/early/cayley.htm\n |accessdate  = 2009-07-26\n |url-status     = live\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20090413155148/http://aviation-history.com/early/cayley.htm\n |archivedate = 2009-04-13\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite encyclopedia\n |title       = Sir George Carley (British Inventor and Scientist)\n |url         = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/100795/Sir-George-Cayley-6th-Baronet\n |encyclopedia   = Britannica\n |accessdate  = 2009-07-26\n |quote       = English pioneer of aerial navigation and aeronautical engineering and designer of the first successful glider to carry a human being aloft.\n |url-status     = live\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20090311002545/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/100795/Sir-George-Cayley-6th-Baronet\n |archivedate = 2009-03-11\n}}</ref> Early dirigible developments included machine-powered propulsion ([[Henri Giffard]], 1852), rigid frames ([[David Schwarz (aviation inventor)|David Schwarz]], 1896) and improved speed and maneuverability ([[Alberto Santos-Dumont]], 1901)\n\n[[File:First flight2.jpg|thumb|First powered and controlled flight by the [[Wright brothers]], December 17, 1903]]\nThere are [[Early flying machines|many competing claims]] for the earliest powered, heavier-than-air flight.

One of the most successful designs of this period was the [[Douglas DC-3]], which became the first [[airliner]] to be profitable carrying passengers exclusively, starting the modern era of passenger airline service. By the beginning of World War II, many towns and cities had built airports, and there were numerous qualified pilots available. The war brought many innovations to aviation, including the first [[turbojet|jet]] aircraft and the first liquid-fueled [[rocket]]s.\n\n[[File:Helios cthomas.jpg|thumb|left|[[NASA]]'s [[Helios Prototype|Helios]] researches [[solar power]]ed flight.]]\nAfter World War II, especially in North America, there was a boom in [[general aviation]], both private and commercial, as thousands of pilots were released from military service and many inexpensive war-surplus transport and training aircraft became available. Manufacturers such as [[Cessna]], [[Piper Aircraft|Piper]], and [[Beechcraft]] expanded production to provide light aircraft for the new middle-class market.\n\nBy the 1950s, the development of civil jets grew, beginning with the [[de Havilland Comet]], though the first widely used passenger jet was the [[Boeing 707]], because it was much more economical than other aircraft at that time. At the same time, [[gas turbine|turboprop]] propulsion began to appear for smaller commuter planes, making it possible to serve small-volume routes in a much wider range of weather conditions.\n\nSince the 1960s [[composite material]] airframes and quieter, more efficient engines have become available, and [[Concorde]] provided [[supersonic transport|supersonic passenger service]] for more than two decades, but the most important lasting innovations have taken place in instrumentation and control. The arrival of [[transistor|solid-state]] electronics, the [[Global Positioning System]], [[communications satellite|satellite communications]], and increasingly small and powerful computers and [[light-emitting diode|LED]] displays, have dramatically changed the cockpits of [[airliner]]s and, increasingly, of smaller aircraft as well. Pilots can navigate much more accurately and view terrain, obstructions, and other nearby aircraft on a map or through [[synthetic vision]], even at night or in low visibility.\n\nOn June 21, 2004, [[SpaceShipOne]] became the first privately funded aircraft to make a [[spaceflight]], opening the possibility of an aviation market capable of leaving the Earth's atmosphere. Meanwhile, flying prototypes of aircraft powered by alternative fuels, such as [[ethanol]], [[electricity]], and even [[solar energy]], are becoming more common.\n\n==Operations of aircraft==\n\n===Civil aviation===\n{{Main|Civil aviation}} \nCivil aviation includes all non-military flying, both [[general aviation]] and [[scheduled air transport]].\n\n====Air transport====\n{{Main|Airline}}\n[[File:Northwest Airlines A330-323 (N805NW) landing at London Gatwick Airport.jpg|thumb|right|[[Northwest Airlines]] [[Airbus A330|Airbus A330-323]]]]\n\nThere are five major manufacturers of civil transport aircraft (in alphabetical order):\n* [[Airbus]], based in Europe\n* [[Boeing]], based in the United States\n* [[Bombardier Aerospace|Bombardier]], based in Canada\n* [[Embraer]], based in Brazil\n* [[United Aircraft Corporation]], based in Russia\n\nBoeing, Airbus, [[Ilyushin]] and [[Tupolev]] concentrate on wide-body and narrow-body jet [[airliner]]s, while Bombardier, Embraer and [[Sukhoi]] concentrate on [[regional airliner]]s.

Since then, [[open skies]] agreements have resulted in increased competition and choice for consumers, coupled with falling prices for airlines. The combination of high fuel prices, low fares, high salaries, and crises such as the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] and the [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome|SARS epidemic]] have driven many older airlines to government-bailouts, bankruptcy or mergers. At the same time, [[low-cost carrier]]s such as [[Ryanair]], [[Southwest Airlines|Southwest]] and [[WestJet]] have flourished.\n\n====General aviation====\n{{Main|General aviation}}\n[[File:cessna.120.g-btbw.arp.jpg|thumb|right|1947 [[Cessna 120]]]]\n\n''General aviation'' includes all non-scheduled civil flying, both [[private aviation|private]] and [[commercial aviation|commercial]]. General aviation may include business flights, [[air charter]], private aviation, flight training, [[hot air balloon|ballooning]], [[paragliding]], [[parachuting]], [[Glider (sailplane)|gliding]], [[hang gliding]], [[aerial photography]], [[powered hang glider|foot-launched powered hang gliders]], air ambulance, crop dusting, charter flights, [[traffic reporting]], police air patrols and forest fire fighting.\n\nEach country regulates aviation differently, but general aviation usually falls under different regulations depending on whether it is private or commercial and on the type of equipment involved.\n\nMany small aircraft manufacturers serve the general aviation market, with a focus on private aviation and flight training.\n\nThe most important recent developments for small aircraft (which form the bulk of the GA fleet) have been the introduction of advanced [[avionics]] (including [[Global Positioning System|GPS]]) that were formerly found only in large [[airliner]]s, and the introduction of [[composite material]]s to make small aircraft lighter and faster. [[Ultralight aviation|Ultralight]] and [[homebuilt aircraft]] have also become increasingly popular for recreational use, since in most countries that allow private aviation, they are much less expensive and less heavily regulated than certified aircraft.\n\n===Military aviation===\n{{Main|Military aviation|Aerial warfare}}\nSimple [[balloon (aeronautics)|balloons]] were used as surveillance aircraft as early as the 18th century. Over the years, [[military aircraft]] have been built to meet ever increasing capability requirements. Manufacturers of military aircraft compete for contracts to supply their government's arsenal. Aircraft are selected based on factors like cost, performance, and the speed of production.\n[[File:Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird.jpg|thumb|The [[Lockheed SR-71]] remains unsurpassed in many areas of performance.]]\n\n====Types of military aviation====\n* [[Fighter aircraft]]'s primary function is to destroy other aircraft. (e.g. [[Sopwith Camel]], [[A6M Zero]], [[McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle|F-15]], [[MiG-29]], [[Su-27]], and [[F-22]]).\n* [[Ground attack|Ground attack aircraft]] are used against [[Tactical bombing|tactical]] earth-bound targets. (e.g. [[Junkers Ju 87|Junkers Stuka]], [[A-10 Thunderbolt II|A-10]], [[Ilyushin Il-2|Il-2]], [[J-22 Orao]], [[AH-64]] and [[Sukhoi Su-25|Su-25]]).\n* [[Bomber]]s are generally used against more [[Strategic bombing|strategic]] targets, such as factories and oil fields. (e.g. [[Zeppelin]], [[Tu-95]], [[Dassault Mirage IV|Mirage IV]], and [[B-52 Stratofortress|B-52]]).\n* [[Military transport aircraft|Transport aircraft]] are used to transport hardware and personnel. (e.g. [[C-17 Globemaster III]], [[C-130 Hercules]] and [[Mil Mi-26]]).\n* [[Surveillance aircraft|Surveillance]] and [[Aerial reconnaissance|reconnaissance]] aircraft obtain information about enemy forces. (e.g. [[Rumpler Taube]], [[de Havilland Mosquito|Mosquito]], [[Lockheed U-2|U-2]], [[Bell OH-58 Kiowa|OH-58]] and [[MiG-25R]]).\n* [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)]] are used primarily as reconnaissance fixed-wing aircraft, though many also carry payloads. Cargo aircraft are in development.  (e.g. [[RQ-7|RQ-7B Shadow]], [[MQ-8|MQ-8 Fire Scout]], and [[MQ-1C|MQ-1C Gray Eagle]]).\n* [[Missile]]s deliver warheads, normally explosives, but also things like leaflets.\n\n=== Air safety ===\n{{main|Aviation safety}}\nAviation safety means the state of an aviation system or organization in which risks associated with aviation activities, related to, or in direct support of the operation of aircraft, are reduced and controlled to an acceptable level. It encompasses the theory, practice, investigation, and categorization of flight failures, and the prevention of such failures through regulation, education, and training. It can also be applied in the context of campaigns that inform the public as to the safety of air travel.\n\n==Aviation accidents and incidents==\n{{main|Aviation accidents and incidents}}\n[[File:crash.arp.600pix.jpg|thumb|right|upright|A [[United States Air Force Thunderbirds|USAF Thunderbird]] pilot [[Ejection seat|ejecting]] from his [[F-16]] aircraft at an [[air show]] in 2003]]\n\nAn ''aviation accident'' is defined by the [[Convention on International Civil Aviation]] Annex 13 as an occurrence associated with the operation of an aircraft which takes place between the time any person boards the aircraft with the intention of flight until such time as all such persons have disembarked, in which a person is fatally or seriously injured, the aircraft sustains damage or structural failure or the aircraft is missing or is completely inaccessible.<ref>{{cite web|author=The Investigation Process Research Resource Site|title=International Investigation Standards|url=http://www.iprr.org/manuals/Annex13.html|accessdate=7 May 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120427102210/http://www.iprr.org/manuals/Annex13.html|archivedate=27 April 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe first fatal aviation accident occurred in a [[Wright Model A]] aircraft at [[Fort Myer|Fort Myer, Virginia, USA]], on September 17, 1908, resulting in injury to the pilot, [[Orville Wright]], and death of the passenger, Signal Corps Lieutenant [[Thomas Selfridge]].<ref>{{cite web|author=About.com Inventors|title=Wright Brothers \u2013 First Fatal Airplane Crash in 1908|url=http://inventors.about.com/od/weirdmuseums/ig/Wright-Brothers/First-Fatal-Airplane-Crash.htm|accessdate=7 May 2012}}</ref>\n\nAn ''aviation incident'' is defined as an occurrence, other than an accident, associated with the operation of an aircraft that affects or could affect the safety of operations.<ref name=\"AirSafe.com\">{{cite web|last=AirSafe.com|title=Definitions of Key Terms Used by AirSafe.com|url=http://www.airsafe.com/events/define.htm|accessdate=7 May 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120420172922/http://www.airsafe.com/events/define.htm|archivedate=20 April 2012}}</ref>\n\nAn accident in which the damage to the aircraft is such that it must be written off, or in which the plane is destroyed, is called a ''hull loss accident''.<ref name=\"AirSafe.com\"/>\n\n==Air traffic control==\n{{Main|Air traffic control}}\n[[File:Towers Schiphol small.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Air traffic control tower]]s at [[Amsterdam Airport]]]]\n\nAir traffic control (ATC) involves communication with aircraft to help maintain separation&nbsp;\u2013 that is, they ensure that aircraft are sufficiently far enough apart horizontally or vertically for no risk of collision. Controllers may co-ordinate position reports provided by pilots, or in high traffic areas (such as the United States) they may use [[radar]] to see aircraft positions.\n\nThere are generally four different types of ATC:\n* center controllers, who control aircraft en route between airports\n* control towers (including tower, ground control, clearance delivery, and other services), which control aircraft within a small distance (typically 10\u201315&nbsp;km horizontal, and 1,000 m vertical) of an airport.\n* oceanic controllers, who control aircraft over international waters between continents, generally without radar service.\n* terminal controllers, who control aircraft in a wider area (typically 50\u201380&nbsp;km) around busy airports.\n\nATC is especially important for aircraft flying under [[instrument flight rules]] (IFR), when they may be in weather conditions that do not allow the pilots to see other aircraft. However, in very high-traffic areas, especially near major airports, aircraft flying under [[visual flight rules]] (VFR) are also required to follow instructions from ATC.\n\nIn addition to separation from other aircraft, ATC may provide weather advisories, terrain separation, navigation assistance, and other services to pilots, depending on their workload.\n\nATC do not control all flights. The majority of VFR (Visual Flight Rules) flights in North America are not required to contact ATC (unless they are passing through a busy terminal area or using a major airport), and in many areas, such as northern Canada and low altitude in northern Scotland, Air traffic control services are not available even for IFR flights at lower altitudes.\n\n==Environmental impact==\n{{Main|Environmental impact of aviation}}\n\nLike all activities involving [[combustion]], operating powered aircraft (from airliners to hot air balloons) releases [[soot]] and other pollutants into the atmosphere. [[Greenhouse gas]]es such as [[carbon dioxide]] (CO<sub>2</sub>) are also produced. In addition, there are environmental impacts specific to aviation: for instance, [[File:Contrails.jpg|thumb|Water vapor [[Condensation trails|contrails]] left by high-altitude jet [[airliner]]s.
