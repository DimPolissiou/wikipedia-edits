They were wartime organizations only, in the peacetime the fronts were normally disbanded and their armies organized back into [[military district|military ''districts'']]. \nUsually a single district formed a single front at the start of the hostilities, or when hostilities were anticipated. Some military districts could not form a front.

The reason for that is in the Soviet military doctrine. With the reform of 1935 it was established that in case of a war the peacetime military districts on the border would split upon mobilisation each into a Front Command (taking control of the district's peacetime military formations) and a Military District Command (which stayed behind with the mission to mobilise the reserve formations and put them at the disposal of the Fronts as replacement troops). In that sense the Air Armies were under Air Force command in peacetime, but under the command of the Frontal HQs in wartime and the Fronts were commanded by Ground Forces generals. The entire front might report either to the [[Stavka]] or to a [[theatre of military operations]] (TVD). A Front was mobilised for a specific operation, after which it could be reformed and tasked with another operation (including a change of the Front's designation) or it could be disbanded with its formations dispersed among the other active Fronts and its HQ reintegrated into its original Military District HQ.\n\nThe Soviet and Russian military doctrine calls the different levels in the command chain (including the Fronts) Organs of Military Control (''{{Lang-ru|\u041e\u0440\u0433\u0430\u043d\u044b \u0432\u043e\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0443\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f}}'').\n{| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\"\n|+Organs of Military Control\n!Level\n!Peacetime\n!Peacetime and wartime\n!Function\n!Examples\n|-\n|Highest political control\n|'''Main Military Council'''  (''{{Lang-ru|\u0413\u043b\u0430\u0432\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0432\u043e\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0441\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0442 \u0420\u041a\u041a\u0410}}'')\n| rowspan=\"2\" |[[Stavka|'''Stavka of the Supreme Main Command''']] (''{{Lang-ru|\u0421\u0442\u0430\u0432\u043a\u0430 \u0432\u0435\u0440\u0445\u043e\u0432\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0433\u043b\u0430\u0432\u043d\u043e\u043a\u043e\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f}}'')\n\n* [[General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation#History|'''General Staff''']]\n|Exercises supreme party control over the armed forces.

They were wartime organizations only, in the peacetime the fronts were normally disbanded and their armies organized back into [[military district|military ''districts'']]. \nUsually a single district formed a single front at the start of the hostilities, or when hostilities were anticipated. Some military districts could not form a front. Fronts were also formed during the [[Polish-Soviet War]] of 1920.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nThe main fronts during the Russian Civil War and Polish-Soviet War were :\n*[[Northern Front (RSFSR)|Northern Front]] (15 September 1918 - 19 February 1919) \n*[[Western Front (RSFSR)|Western Front]] (12 February 1919 - 8 April 1924)\n*[[Southwestern Front (RSFSR)|Southwestern Front]] (10 January 1920 - 5 December 1920)\n*[[Southern Front (RSFSR)|Southern Front]] (September 1918 \u2013 January 1920 and September \u2013 December 1920)\n*[[Southeastern Front (RSFSR)|Southeastern Front]] (30 September 1919 - 16 January 1920).\n*[[Eastern Front (RSFSR)|Eastern Front]] (13 June 1918 - 15 January 1920) \n*[[Turkestan Front]] (23 February 1919 \u2013 4 June 1926)\n*[[Ukrainian Front (RSFSR)|Ukrainian Front]] (January - June 1919)\n*[[Caspian-Caucasian Front]] (8 December 1918 - 13 March 1919) \n*[[Caucasian Front (RSFSR)|Caucasian Front]] (16 January 1920 - 29 May 1921)\n\n== Soviet fronts in World War II ==\n{{very long section|date=June 2015}}\nAn interesting and important distinction between [[army group]]s and fronts is that a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] front typically had its own army-sized tactical fixed-wing air organization.<ref>[[Viktor Suvorov]], [[Inside the Soviet Army]]: [http://militera.lib.ru/research/suvorov12/03.html Fronts], Hamish Hamilton, 198x</ref> This [[air army]] was directly subordinated to the front commander (typically a ground commander). The reason for that is in the Soviet military doctrine. With the reform of 1935 it was established that in case of a war the peacetime military districts on the border would split upon mobilisation each into a Front Command (taking control of the district's peacetime military formations) and a Military District Command (which stayed behind with the mission to mobilise the reserve formations and put them at the disposal of the Fronts as replacement troops).

Though there was no front ever established during peacetime the basic building blocks were maintained the established Military Districts. A front generally comprised 3-4 Combined Arms Armies and 1-2 Tank Armies though there was no set organization.<ref>US Army FM 100-2-3 The Soviet Army: Troops, Organization, and Equipment</ref>\n\n== Poland ==\nA number of fronts were created by the [[Second Polish Republic]] from 1918 to 1939, among them being the [[Polish Southern Front]]. See [[:pl:Kategoria:Fronty polskie]]. In addition, the creation of a Polish Front was considered to group the First and Second Armies of the [[Polish Armed Forces in the East]] in 1944, and during the Warsaw Pact period, a Polish Front was created, seemingly as a mobilization-only organization.\n\n==Citations and notes==\n{{reflist}}\n<!--Use for footnotes containing source page citations or short commentary on the main text-->\n\n==References==\n* [[John Erickson (historian)|John Erickson]], The Road to Stalingrad: Stalin's War with Germany, Weidenfeld & Nicolson, London, 1975\n* [[David Glantz]], Colossus Reborn: The Red Army at War 1941-43, University Press of Kansas, 2005\n\n<!--Any links that have not been cited in the article, but related to the article subject area-->\n<!--===========================({{NoMoreLinks}})===============================-->\n<!--| DO NOT ADD MORE LINKS TO THIS ARTICLE.

She was introduced as a potential adoptive child for [[Anna Windass|Anna]] ([[Debbie Rush]]) and [[Eddie Windass]] ([[Steve Huison]]) in the episode aired on 24 January 2011. Faye's early storylines have included being adopted by Anna and Eddie, being the victim and perpetrator of bullying, contacting her birth father [[Tim Metcalfe (Coronation Street)|Tim Metcalfe]] ([[Joe Duttine]]) and accusing Anna of abusing her. Her later storylines include her falling pregnant at the age of 12 and keeping it secret from her family. Faye's struggling to bond with her daughter, [[Miley Windass|Miley]]  (Erin, Eilah and Elsie Halliwell) results in her giving her up to [[Jackson Hodge]] ([[Rhys Cadman]]) and reuniting with her as well as developing a relationship with [[Seb Franklin]] (Harry Visinoni).\n\n==Storylines==\nFaye is introduced to [[Eddie Windass|Eddie]] ([[Steve Huison]]) and [[Anna Windass]] ([[Debbie Rush]]) by her social worker, [[List of Coronation Street characters (2010)#Hilary Pugsley|Hilary Pugsley]] ([[Caroline Pegg]]). After several visits, Faye begins to like the Windasses but the adoption is threatened by the revelation that their son, [[Gary Windass|Gary]] ([[Mikey North]]), has been discharged from the army and will be living with them. Despite this, Faye stays the night at the Windasses' for the first time in February. When Faye visits in March, she is annoyed to discover that Eddie and Anna have been searching her bag and she storms out in a mood. Gary, however, speaks to Faye and convinces her that they can be trusted. When Faye stays overnight, Eddie accidentally washes Faye's blanket, she is furious and tells him that it is the only thing that she has to remember her mother by before insisting on returning to her foster home. Faye later moves in with the Windass family permanently. When Faye and Anna visit neighbour, [[Fiz Brown|Fiz Stape]] ([[Jenny McAlpine]]) and her baby [[Hope Stape|Hope]], Faye steals a bag containing \u00a3500 that Fiz is keeping secret from husband, [[John Stape|John]] ([[Graeme Hawley]]). Faye gives Anna the bag as a gift but Anna finds the money and insists Faye tell her where she got it from. Faye admits that she stole it and a box of chocolates from The Kabin and earrings from her foster home that she also gave Anna, making Anna and Eddie worry about Faye's behaviour. Soon after, Anna and Eddie learn from Hilary that Faye's mother has died from a heroin overdose and she urges them to tell Faye. Anna wants to tell her after a picnic that she and Faye had planned but Eddie accidentally tells her. When Eddie leaves for Germany, Faye thinks it is her fault that he left but Anna reassures her that she is not to blame. When [[Katy Armstrong]] ([[Georgia May Foote]]) falls pregnant, Faye tells her father, [[Owen Armstrong|Owen]] ([[Ian Puleston-Davies]]), making Katy think Anna told him so Anna asks Faye if she was responsible but she denies it. In November 2011, Faye's adoption becomes official but her happiness is short-lived when she discovers that Owen is dating Anna. Faye is scared that Owen will not want her around but Gary, Owen and Anna promise her that nothing will change. Faye wins the role of Mary in the Bessie Street Primary Nativity, but she suffers an onset of nerves before the play and refuses to participate so Katy takes over and gives birth to her son, [[Joseph Brown (Coronation Street)|Joseph Brown]], during the production.\n\nFaye kills Owen's fish and when he discovers that she was responsible, he smacks her across the back of her legs. Faye tells Anna what happened and she breaks up with Owen. He and Anna later reconcile but she warns him that he has to make amends with Faye too, which he does and life settles down again. In February 2012, Faye realised that Katy had left Joseph at home alone and convinced Katy to let her look after him whilst she went out to buy nappies. Faye made herself cheese on toast while she was away, but while emptying the bin she accidentally locked herself out with the grill-pan on. Admitting she needed help, she told Owen and Anna. They rescued Joseph from his cot and Owen insisted the baby stay with him but Chesney overruled him and Katy was persuaded to come home and to talk to people if she needed help in future. Faye is bullied by [[List of Coronation Street characters (2012)#Lindsay Hayward|Lindsay Hayward]] (Eleni Foskett) for being adopted. Anna notices that Faye is more withdrawn and on checking her computer, finds evidence of bullying and promptly takes it to the school. Headmaster [[Brian Packham]] ([[Peter Gunn (actor)|Peter Gunn]]) takes it seriously, but worries, when he discovers the bully's identity, as Lindsay's grandmother, is head of the board of governors. He then tries to dismiss it as childish pranks, leading Anna to remove Faye from school. Knowing what would be expected if the bully was any other child, Brian reports it and Lindsay is suspended. Brian asks Faye to give the school another chance on the promise that Lindsay will be closely watched, which she does.\n\nAnna discovers that Faye is in touch with her birth father [[Tim Metcalfe (Coronation Street)|Tim Metcalfe]] ([[Joe Duttine]]), who she hasn't seen since she was two years old. Neither Anna nor Owen are happy with the situation and trying to stop her contacting Tim, Owen even destroys her computer but when Tim learns of this and sees Owen's temper in action himself, he warns Anna that if she persists in trying to keep him out of Faye's life, he will report Faye's family life as unsafe to Social Services. Worried about losing Faye, Anna reluctantly gave in as she had also been advised by her social worker that there was no reason not to allow him access. Faye tells Anna she wants to live with her dad. Anna confronts Tim about it and Tim says he has no idea about the situation. When Anna comes to pick Faye up again, she refuses to budge, so Anna drags her back home, kicking and screaming. When Faye returns, she screams to Anna and Owen that she hates them and smashes a cupboard and some ornaments. Still upset and livid at Anna, she makes a shocking allegation to Brian about Anna hitting her. However, when she gets interviewed by the police, she admits she made it up as she doesn't want Anna going to prison. She explains to Anna that while she will love her forever, she feels different with her father. Anna asks Tim if Faye can live with him temporarily, Tim still doesn't think it's a good idea, but after some persuasion, he agrees, much to Faye's delight. Tim takes up a temporary job up in [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] and Faye is supposed to stay with Anna. Unknown to Anna, Faye is staying in the flat alone. Owen soon discovers Faye on her own when [[Sophie Webster]] ([[Brooke Vincent]]) reveals Faye tried to shoplift. In July 2013, Faye decides to go back to Anna's to live. Anna tells Owen to warn Tim off. Owen acts friendly but then grabs Tim's hand and threatens him to leave Weatherfield. In the end, Owen and Anna agree to let Tim stay, and he starts a relationship with [[Sally Webster]] ([[Sally Dynevor]]).\n\nFaye starts Weatherfield High School and makes friends with a girl named [[List of Coronation Street characters (2013)#Grace Piper|Grace Piper]] (Ella-Grace Gregoire) who appears to be innocent, but actually is a troublemaker who tries to get Faye to become like her. However, Grace soon shows her true colours and encourages Faye to throw stones at [[Mary Taylor (Coronation Street)|Mary Taylor]]'s ([[Patti Clare]]) caravan and to torment [[Nick Tilsley]] ([[Ben Price]]), who has recently suffered brain damage. Grace then forces Faye to put [[Simon Barlow]] ([[Alex Bain (actor)|Alex Bain]]) into a dress and films the incident. Although Faye initially denies any wrongdoing, the video is soon found by [[Peter Barlow (Coronation Street)|Peter Barlow]] ([[Chris Gascoyne]]) and Faye is forced to admit the truth. When the police become involved, Faye admits that Grace has been forcing her to do things by threatening not to be her friend anymore. Faye is given a caution and tells Anna that she and Grace are no longer friends. Anna reassures her she'll be able to make new friends and she can start to show people she is not really a bully. Faye returns home drunk after attending a bowling party. Owen and Gary get into a conflict about the parental responsibility of Faye. Several weeks later, Owen turns bankrupt and debt collectors take the furniture from the Windass' house. As Christmas approaches, Faye and her family move into Peter's old flat. In December 2014, Owen and Gary fight when Katy makes a snide comment about Gary, leading to Gary accidentally breaking Faye's headphones, as part of a Christmas present from her family. A remorseful Gary promises to make it up to Faye by buying her some new ones.\n\nFaye mentions to [[Craig Tinker]] (Colson Smith) that she is being bullied by some girls in her year, as she says that they mock her about her weight. She continues to miss school and starve herself, and after [[Audrey Roberts]] ([[Sue Nicholls]]) spots Faye in the shopping precinct when she should be in school, Anna pushes Craig to tell her what's happening. Faye tells Anna she was at the precinct to work on a school project, but Katy sees her in the park and catches her trying to smoke when a packet of cigarettes fall out of her bag. Katy is worried for Faye, but sympathetic when Faye reveals she thinks smoking will make her thin. Katy agrees not to tell Anna, but Anna and Owen have already found out that Faye is bunking off school. Faye eventually confesses about the bullying, explaining she kept silent out of fear that Anna would \"make a fuss about her\". After looking up Faye's symptoms online to find out what's going on with her weight, Craig is suspicious that Faye may be pregnant. Faye takes a pregnancy test, which confirms she is pregnant. Faye is scared and terrified, with only Craig there to support her. Faye watches a birthing video, which worries her. She confides in Craig about her plan to abandon her baby as soon as she gives birth. During her parents' evening, Faye comes face-to-face with the father of her baby, [[Jackson Hodge]] ([[Rhys Cadman]]) and she runs out of the school hall, upset. Faye has a plan to give birth in [[Dev Alahan]]'s ([[Jimmi Harkishin]]) old flat above the shop and abandon the baby as she planned at the start. Faye and Craig intend on staying in the flat until Faye is ready to give birth, but she goes into labour unexpectedly and feeling scared, she tells Craig to get Anna and Owen. Sophie hears Faye crying in pain and she comes into the flat to find Faye on the floor and in labour. Owen and Anna arrive in time and they discover that Faye is close to giving birth. Faye gives birth to a baby girl whom she names [[Miley Windass|Miley]], after singer [[Miley Cyrus]]. After the baby is born, Faye refuses to meet, let alone look at her own daughter. Faye and the baby come home from hospital after Faye is interviewed by the police, who she tells about the father is a boy from school. Faye confides in Sophie, revealing to her that the father of her baby is Jackson, who she liked and was devastated to discover that Jackson never liked her back. Faye has the courage to tell Anna about Jackson being the baby's father and Anna arranges a meeting with Jackson and his parents the next day. After accusing Craig of getting Faye pregnant and hitting [[Kirk Sutherland]] ([[Andrew Whyment]]), Owen is arrested for assault after being reported. The aftermath of Faye's pregnancy and the baby's birth is the main gossip around the street. Owen is let off with a caution after his attack on Kirk and he comes home the next day. Faye comes face-to-face once again with Jackson when he and his parents arrive on Anna's doorstep. Anna breaks the news to the family that Faye has given birth and Jackson is the father of Faye's baby. When Jackson denies being near Faye, let alone having a one-night stand with her, Faye angrily confronts Jackson to tell the truth, but he refuses. Jackson and his family leave after Jackson's mother makes cruel remarks about Faye.\n\nFaye receives a visit from the social worker, who asks Faye how she feels about taking on maternal responsibility of the baby, as she is very young. Faye admits that she is not ready to be a mother and she wants her baby to be adopted, devastating Anna, who blames Faye's outburst on Owen. As Faye comes to terms with her decisions on the baby's upbringing, she discovers that Owen and Anna have split up for good and Owen announces to a distraught Faye that he is leaving Weatherfield to go and live in Scotland. Faye very slowly learns how to care for her daughter and she names her baby girl Miley.\n\nFaye continues to struggle with the responsibility of Miley, as she allows her mother to care for Miley. When Tim allows Faye to go on a school trip, Faye returns afterwards and Anna arrives at the school with Miley and angrily confronts her daughter, as she tells Faye that it is time for her to get her priorities straight and focus on the upbringing of Miley. Now, with the support of Miley's paternal family, Faye slowly learns how to care for her daughter. At Miley's christening, all is proven too much for Faye when she breaks down and admits to her father that she is not ready to be a mother so young. The christening is cancelled by Tim, who is offered a solution to keep Faye and Miley happy; for the Hodges to gain the care of Miley to prevent her from being adopted, as Faye no longer wants Miley to be a part of her life. Tim and Anna discuss the options with Faye, who admits that she could never hate or blame Miley for the recent events, but she does love her and wants what is best for her. In the end, Miley's grandmother collects her and the Windasses are devastated as Miley leaves their family for good. Miley goes on holiday with the Hodges to [[Canada]] and when they are due back, Tim tells Anna that their house was up to let. Anna contacts Josie and eventually manages to get hold of her and Anna and Tim discover that they aren't coming back from Canada. Anna and Tim tell Faye and they later ask her if she wants Miley back, but Faye decides that Miley should remain in Canada with the Hodges.\n\nAfter keeping their relationship secret, Anna and [[Kevin Webster]] ([[Michael Le Vell]]) tell Faye they are dating. Faye offers to babysit Jake and her boyfriend, [[Seb Franklin]] (Harry Visinoni), visits. Anna and Kevin walk in on Faye and Seb and Anna has a go at Faye. Kevin gets Anna to make up with Faye and invite Seb to join them for a family meal. Seb impresses Faye's family and the pair later share a kiss. Faye struggles with Anna being in hospital with severe burns and she drinks alcohol. Seb tells Faye that Craig threatened him. Faye steals [[Pat Phelan (Coronation Street)|Pat Phelan]]'s (Connor McIntyre) phone to impress Seb and Anna is furious with Faye for taking it. Faye is taken to a gig by Gary with his girlfriend's, [[Sarah Platt]]'s ([[Tina O'Brien]]), daughter [[Bethany Platt]] ([[Lucy Fallon]]). Bethany lays seductively on Gary's bed and Faye catches her. Bethany gives Faye vodka to keep quiet, but Faye drops hints at dinner. Bethany admits to giving Faye the vodka when she is drunk. Anna is furious when Faye spends her birthday money on a tattoo and Seb supplied her with a fake ID. Faye is taken to the hospital with Gary and Izzy when the tattoo becomes infected and Faye sees Miley and Jackson. Faye takes Jackson and Miley home to see Anna and Tim. Seb assaults Jackson, as he is jealous at his closeness with Faye, and is arrested. Anna forbids Faye from seeing Seb, but Faye's stepsister, [[Rosie Webster]] ([[Helen Flanagan]]), gets Faye to talk to him.\n\nFaye is upset when Seb is sentenced to four months imprisonment and persuades Phelan to take her to visit Seb. Anna catches Faye in Phelan's van and Anna drives the van away with Faye inside. Faye and Anna argue about Faye's relationship with Seb and about Phelan and Faye runs off. Anna reluctantly agrees to Faye moving in with Gary and Izzy in the short term. Anna, Tim and Kevin discover Faye has had sex with Seb when a condom wrapper is found in the bin. Tim forces Seb to break up with Faye, but they meet up and agree to keep their relationship secret. Faye is upset when Seb breaks up with her, but they get back together when an injured Seb, claiming he has been in a fight, worries he will be sent back to young offenders and wants to be with Faye. Faye packs a bag and Seb finds out she has planned for them to run away to stop him going to young offenders, but Seb is not happy with her idea. Anna, Tim and Kevin are worried when Faye has left her phone and is planning to go to Dublin. Seb admits his stepfather was responsible for causing the injury. Seb attempts to steal a car, but when the owners show up, he flees and Faye is caught and collected from the police station by Tim and Kevin.\n\nAfter weeks of Anna helping Seb with his family, Faye accuses Seb of having an affair with Anna after finding texts between the pair and when he takes Faye to see his house, they find his mother, [[Abi Franklin]] ([[Sally Carman]]), unconscious after overdosing. Faye and Seb are angry at Anna after social services take Seb's brother and sister into care, accusing Anna of phoning them. Faye is distraught when Seb falls off a ladder. Anna and Tim find out that Seb may have [[HIV]] from his ex-girlfriend, which Faye might have. Seb tells Anna that he and Faye never have unprotected sex, but a condom did split. Faye calls the police on Anna after Seb says Anna pushed him and Faye is told about Seb having HIV and that she requires a test by Anna, Tim and Sally. Faye's result is negative whilst Seb is positive and Faye is determined to stand by Seb. Sally allows Seb to move in with her and admits she called social services, but Seb understands Sally's reasons and decides to stay. Anna is arrested by the police again when Pat convinces Seb that she was responsible. Prior to her bail hearing, Gary is annoyed that Faye is starting to believe Phelan and Anna is refused bail. Faye refuses to live with Tim or Gary, choosing to stay with Seb at Pat's. Faye refuses to listen to Gary's negative views on Phelan, but he tells Faye that Pat raped Anna once. Gary explains that Pat forced Anna to have sex as he put their family in debt and was overworking him and Owen, but Faye does not believe it was rape. When Anna collapses in prison, she is taken to hospital but escapes when the prison guard is occupied. Faye notices Phelan's gleeful reaction and confronts him over what happened between him and Anna. Faye breaks up with Seb when he refuses to believe Anna did not push him, siding with Phelan. When Anna arranges to meet Gary in the park, Seb overhears and reports it to Phelan, who calls the police and Faye and Gary ask Craig to warn Anna of police presence, which Craig reluctantly does. Anna escapes and hides in [[Roy Cropper]]'s ([[David Neilson]]) flat and Faye and Gary are reunited with Anna when [[David Platt (Coronation Street)|David Platt]] ([[Jack P. Shepherd]]) catches her there but agrees to keep quiet. Anna accidentally hits [[Eileen Grimshaw|Eileen Phelan]] ([[Sue Cleaver]]) over the head when she tries to find proof at the yard that Phelan is lying and when he returns, he calls the police and Anna flees with Faye. Anna and Faye are tracked down by the police and Faye is taken back to Gary. At Anna's trial, Seb tells the court Anna was not responsible for his injuries, but she is found guilty and sent to prison. Seb disappears and Faye figures out he staying with Phelan's daughter, [[Nicola Rubinstein]] ([[Nicola Thorp]]), and Phelan follows Faye, who tells Phelan she is seeking advice from Nicola on bullying. Tim moves Faye away from Weatherfield to stay with his father, [[Geoff Metcalfe]] ([[Ian Bartholomew]]). Eventually, Faye returns to the street to live with Tim and Sally.\n\n==Casting==\nThe character of Faye is created as a potential adoptive child for Anna and Eddie Windass. The casting of Ellie Leach was announced in January 2011. Of her casting, her cousin, co-star [[Brooke Vincent]], said \"I am chuffed to bits for her. She has made me so happy.

She was introduced as a potential adoptive child for [[Anna Windass|Anna]] ([[Debbie Rush]]) and [[Eddie Windass]] ([[Steve Huison]]) in the episode aired on 24 January 2011. Faye's early storylines have included being adopted by Anna and Eddie, being the victim and perpetrator of bullying, contacting her birth father [[Tim Metcalfe (Coronation Street)|Tim Metcalfe]] ([[Joe Duttine]]) and accusing Anna of abusing her. Her later storylines include her falling pregnant at the age of 12 and keeping it secret from her family. Faye's struggling to bond with her daughter, [[Miley Windass|Miley]]  (Erin, Eilah and Elsie Halliwell) results in her giving her up to [[Jackson Hodge]] ([[Rhys Cadman]]) and reuniting with her as well as developing a relationship with [[Seb Franklin]] (Harry Visinoni).\n\n==Storylines==\nFaye is introduced to [[Eddie Windass|Eddie]] ([[Steve Huison]]) and [[Anna Windass]] ([[Debbie Rush]]) by her social worker, [[List of Coronation Street characters (2010)#Hilary Pugsley|Hilary Pugsley]] ([[Caroline Pegg]]). After several visits, Faye begins to like the Windasses but the adoption is threatened by the revelation that their son, [[Gary Windass|Gary]] ([[Mikey North]]), has been discharged from the army and will be living with them. Despite this, Faye stays the night at the Windasses' for the first time in February. When Faye visits in March, she is annoyed to discover that Eddie and Anna have been searching her bag and she storms out in a mood. Gary, however, speaks to Faye and convinces her that they can be trusted. When Faye stays overnight, Eddie accidentally washes Faye's blanket, she is furious and tells him that it is the only thing that she has to remember her mother by before insisting on returning to her foster home. Faye later moves in with the Windass family permanently. When Faye and Anna visit neighbour, [[Fiz Brown|Fiz Stape]] ([[Jenny McAlpine]]) and her baby [[Hope Stape|Hope]], Faye steals a bag containing \u00a3500 that Fiz is keeping secret from husband, [[John Stape|John]] ([[Graeme Hawley]]). Faye gives Anna the bag as a gift but Anna finds the money and insists Faye tell her where she got it from. Faye admits that she stole it and a box of chocolates from The Kabin and earrings from her foster home that she also gave Anna, making Anna and Eddie worry about Faye's behaviour. Soon after, Anna and Eddie learn from Hilary that Faye's mother has died from a heroin overdose and she urges them to tell Faye. Anna wants to tell her after a picnic that she and Faye had planned but Eddie accidentally tells her. When Eddie leaves for Germany, Faye thinks it is her fault that he left but Anna reassures her that she is not to blame. When [[Katy Armstrong]] ([[Georgia May Foote]]) falls pregnant, Faye tells her father, [[Owen Armstrong|Owen]] ([[Ian Puleston-Davies]]), making Katy think Anna told him so Anna asks Faye if she was responsible but she denies it. In November 2011, Faye's adoption becomes official but her happiness is short-lived when she discovers that Owen is dating Anna. Faye is scared that Owen will not want her around but Gary, Owen and Anna promise her that nothing will change. Faye wins the role of Mary in the Bessie Street Primary Nativity, but she suffers an onset of nerves before the play and refuses to participate so Katy takes over and gives birth to her son, [[Joseph Brown (Coronation Street)|Joseph Brown]], during the production.\n\nFaye kills Owen's fish and when he discovers that she was responsible, he smacks her across the back of her legs. Faye tells Anna what happened and she breaks up with Owen. He and Anna later reconcile but she warns him that he has to make amends with Faye too, which he does and life settles down again. In February 2012, Faye realised that Katy had left Joseph at home alone and convinced Katy to let her look after him whilst she went out to buy nappies. Faye made herself cheese on toast while she was away, but while emptying the bin she accidentally locked herself out with the grill-pan on. Admitting she needed help, she told Owen and Anna. They rescued Joseph from his cot and Owen insisted the baby stay with him but Chesney overruled him and Katy was persuaded to come home and to talk to people if she needed help in future. Faye is bullied by [[List of Coronation Street characters (2012)#Lindsay Hayward|Lindsay Hayward]] (Eleni Foskett) for being adopted. Anna notices that Faye is more withdrawn and on checking her computer, finds evidence of bullying and promptly takes it to the school. Headmaster [[Brian Packham]] ([[Peter Gunn (actor)|Peter Gunn]]) takes it seriously, but worries, when he discovers the bully's identity, as Lindsay's grandmother, is head of the board of governors. He then tries to dismiss it as childish pranks, leading Anna to remove Faye from school. Knowing what would be expected if the bully was any other child, Brian reports it and Lindsay is suspended. Brian asks Faye to give the school another chance on the promise that Lindsay will be closely watched, which she does.\n\nAnna discovers that Faye is in touch with her birth father [[Tim Metcalfe (Coronation Street)|Tim Metcalfe]] ([[Joe Duttine]]), who she hasn't seen since she was two years old. Neither Anna nor Owen are happy with the situation and trying to stop her contacting Tim, Owen even destroys her computer but when Tim learns of this and sees Owen's temper in action himself, he warns Anna that if she persists in trying to keep him out of Faye's life, he will report Faye's family life as unsafe to Social Services. Worried about losing Faye, Anna reluctantly gave in as she had also been advised by her social worker that there was no reason not to allow him access. Faye tells Anna she wants to live with her dad. Anna confronts Tim about it and Tim says he has no idea about the situation. When Anna comes to pick Faye up again, she refuses to budge, so Anna drags her back home, kicking and screaming. When Faye returns, she screams to Anna and Owen that she hates them and smashes a cupboard and some ornaments. Still upset and livid at Anna, she makes a shocking allegation to Brian about Anna hitting her. However, when she gets interviewed by the police, she admits she made it up as she doesn't want Anna going to prison. She explains to Anna that while she will love her forever, she feels different with her father. Anna asks Tim if Faye can live with him temporarily, Tim still doesn't think it's a good idea, but after some persuasion, he agrees, much to Faye's delight. Tim takes up a temporary job up in [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] and Faye is supposed to stay with Anna. Unknown to Anna, Faye is staying in the flat alone. Owen soon discovers Faye on her own when [[Sophie Webster]] ([[Brooke Vincent]]) reveals Faye tried to shoplift. In July 2013, Faye decides to go back to Anna's to live. Anna tells Owen to warn Tim off. Owen acts friendly but then grabs Tim's hand and threatens him to leave Weatherfield. In the end, Owen and Anna agree to let Tim stay, and he starts a relationship with [[Sally Webster]] ([[Sally Dynevor]]).\n\nFaye starts Weatherfield High School and makes friends with a girl named [[List of Coronation Street characters (2013)#Grace Piper|Grace Piper]] (Ella-Grace Gregoire) who appears to be innocent, but actually is a troublemaker who tries to get Faye to become like her. However, Grace soon shows her true colours and encourages Faye to throw stones at [[Mary Taylor (Coronation Street)|Mary Taylor]]'s ([[Patti Clare]]) caravan and to torment [[Nick Tilsley]] ([[Ben Price]]), who has recently suffered brain damage. Grace then forces Faye to put [[Simon Barlow]] ([[Alex Bain (actor)|Alex Bain]]) into a dress and films the incident. Although Faye initially denies any wrongdoing, the video is soon found by [[Peter Barlow (Coronation Street)|Peter Barlow]] ([[Chris Gascoyne]]) and Faye is forced to admit the truth. When the police become involved, Faye admits that Grace has been forcing her to do things by threatening not to be her friend anymore. Faye is given a caution and tells Anna that she and Grace are no longer friends. Anna reassures her she'll be able to make new friends and she can start to show people she is not really a bully. Faye returns home drunk after attending a bowling party. Owen and Gary get into a conflict about the parental responsibility of Faye. Several weeks later, Owen turns bankrupt and debt collectors take the furniture from the Windass' house. As Christmas approaches, Faye and her family move into Peter's old flat. In December 2014, Owen and Gary fight when Katy makes a snide comment about Gary, leading to Gary accidentally breaking Faye's headphones, as part of a Christmas present from her family. A remorseful Gary promises to make it up to Faye by buying her some new ones.\n\nFaye mentions to [[Craig Tinker]] (Colson Smith) that she is being bullied by some girls in her year, as she says that they mock her about her weight. She continues to miss school and starve herself, and after [[Audrey Roberts]] ([[Sue Nicholls]]) spots Faye in the shopping precinct when she should be in school, Anna pushes Craig to tell her what's happening. Faye tells Anna she was at the precinct to work on a school project, but Katy sees her in the park and catches her trying to smoke when a packet of cigarettes fall out of her bag. Katy is worried for Faye, but sympathetic when Faye reveals she thinks smoking will make her thin. Katy agrees not to tell Anna, but Anna and Owen have already found out that Faye is bunking off school. Faye eventually confesses about the bullying, explaining she kept silent out of fear that Anna would \"make a fuss about her\". After looking up Faye's symptoms online to find out what's going on with her weight, Craig is suspicious that Faye may be pregnant. Faye takes a pregnancy test, which confirms she is pregnant. Faye is scared and terrified, with only Craig there to support her. Faye watches a birthing video, which worries her. She confides in Craig about her plan to abandon her baby as soon as she gives birth. During her parents' evening, Faye comes face-to-face with the father of her baby, [[Jackson Hodge]] ([[Rhys Cadman]]) and she runs out of the school hall, upset. Faye has a plan to give birth in [[Dev Alahan]]'s ([[Jimmi Harkishin]]) old flat above the shop and abandon the baby as she planned at the start. Faye and Craig intend on staying in the flat until Faye is ready to give birth, but she goes into labour unexpectedly and feeling scared, she tells Craig to get Anna and Owen. Sophie hears Faye crying in pain and she comes into the flat to find Faye on the floor and in labour. Owen and Anna arrive in time and they discover that Faye is close to giving birth. Faye gives birth to a baby girl whom she names [[Miley Windass|Miley]], after singer [[Miley Cyrus]]. After the baby is born, Faye refuses to meet, let alone look at her own daughter. Faye and the baby come home from hospital after Faye is interviewed by the police, who she tells about the father is a boy from school. Faye confides in Sophie, revealing to her that the father of her baby is Jackson, who she liked and was devastated to discover that Jackson never liked her back. Faye has the courage to tell Anna about Jackson being the baby's father and Anna arranges a meeting with Jackson and his parents the next day. After accusing Craig of getting Faye pregnant and hitting [[Kirk Sutherland]] ([[Andrew Whyment]]), Owen is arrested for assault after being reported. The aftermath of Faye's pregnancy and the baby's birth is the main gossip around the street. Owen is let off with a caution after his attack on Kirk and he comes home the next day. Faye comes face-to-face once again with Jackson when he and his parents arrive on Anna's doorstep. Anna breaks the news to the family that Faye has given birth and Jackson is the father of Faye's baby. When Jackson denies being near Faye, let alone having a one-night stand with her, Faye angrily confronts Jackson to tell the truth, but he refuses. Jackson and his family leave after Jackson's mother makes cruel remarks about Faye.\n\nFaye receives a visit from the social worker, who asks Faye how she feels about taking on maternal responsibility of the baby, as she is very young. Faye admits that she is not ready to be a mother and she wants her baby to be adopted, devastating Anna, who blames Faye's outburst on Owen. As Faye comes to terms with her decisions on the baby's upbringing, she discovers that Owen and Anna have split up for good and Owen announces to a distraught Faye that he is leaving Weatherfield to go and live in Scotland. Faye very slowly learns how to care for her daughter and she names her baby girl Miley.\n\nFaye continues to struggle with the responsibility of Miley, as she allows her mother to care for Miley. When Tim allows Faye to go on a school trip, Faye returns afterwards and Anna arrives at the school with Miley and angrily confronts her daughter, as she tells Faye that it is time for her to get her priorities straight and focus on the upbringing of Miley. Now, with the support of Miley's paternal family, Faye slowly learns how to care for her daughter. At Miley's christening, all is proven too much for Faye when she breaks down and admits to her father that she is not ready to be a mother so young. The christening is cancelled by Tim, who is offered a solution to keep Faye and Miley happy; for the Hodges to gain the care of Miley to prevent her from being adopted, as Faye no longer wants Miley to be a part of her life. Tim and Anna discuss the options with Faye, who admits that she could never hate or blame Miley for the recent events, but she does love her and wants what is best for her. In the end, Miley's grandmother collects her and the Windasses are devastated as Miley leaves their family for good. Miley goes on holiday with the Hodges to [[Canada]] and when they are due back, Tim tells Anna that their house was up to let. Anna contacts Josie and eventually manages to get hold of her and Anna and Tim discover that they aren't coming back from Canada. Anna and Tim tell Faye and they later ask her if she wants Miley back, but Faye decides that Miley should remain in Canada with the Hodges.\n\nAfter keeping their relationship secret, Anna and [[Kevin Webster]] ([[Michael Le Vell]]) tell Faye they are dating. Faye offers to babysit Jake and her boyfriend, [[Seb Franklin]] (Harry Visinoni), visits. Anna and Kevin walk in on Faye and Seb and Anna has a go at Faye. Kevin gets Anna to make up with Faye and invite Seb to join them for a family meal. Seb impresses Faye's family and the pair later share a kiss. Faye struggles with Anna being in hospital with severe burns and she drinks alcohol. Seb tells Faye that Craig threatened him. Faye steals [[Pat Phelan (Coronation Street)|Pat Phelan]]'s (Connor McIntyre) phone to impress Seb and Anna is furious with Faye for taking it. Faye is taken to a gig by Gary with his girlfriend's, [[Sarah Platt]]'s ([[Tina O'Brien]]), daughter [[Bethany Platt]] ([[Lucy Fallon]]). Bethany lays seductively on Gary's bed and Faye catches her. Bethany gives Faye vodka to keep quiet, but Faye drops hints at dinner. Bethany admits to giving Faye the vodka when she is drunk. Anna is furious when Faye spends her birthday money on a tattoo and Seb supplied her with a fake ID. Faye is taken to the hospital with Gary and Izzy when the tattoo becomes infected and Faye sees Miley and Jackson. Faye takes Jackson and Miley home to see Anna and Tim. Seb assaults Jackson, as he is jealous at his closeness with Faye, and is arrested. Anna forbids Faye from seeing Seb, but Faye's stepsister, [[Rosie Webster]] ([[Helen Flanagan]]), gets Faye to talk to him.\n\nFaye is upset when Seb is sentenced to four months imprisonment and persuades Phelan to take her to visit Seb. Anna catches Faye in Phelan's van and Anna drives the van away with Faye inside. Faye and Anna argue about Faye's relationship with Seb and about Phelan and Faye runs off. Anna reluctantly agrees to Faye moving in with Gary and Izzy in the short term. Anna, Tim and Kevin discover Faye has had sex with Seb when a condom wrapper is found in the bin. Tim forces Seb to break up with Faye, but they meet up and agree to keep their relationship secret. Faye is upset when Seb breaks up with her, but they get back together when an injured Seb, claiming he has been in a fight, worries he will be sent back to young offenders and wants to be with Faye. Faye packs a bag and Seb finds out she has planned for them to run away to stop him going to young offenders, but Seb is not happy with her idea. Anna, Tim and Kevin are worried when Faye has left her phone and is planning to go to Dublin. Seb admits his stepfather was responsible for causing the injury. Seb attempts to steal a car, but when the owners show up, he flees and Faye is caught and collected from the police station by Tim and Kevin.\n\nAfter weeks of Anna helping Seb with his family, Faye accuses Seb of having an affair with Anna after finding texts between the pair and when he takes Faye to see his house, they find his mother, [[Abi Franklin]] ([[Sally Carman]]), unconscious after overdosing. Faye and Seb are angry at Anna after social services take Seb's brother and sister into care, accusing Anna of phoning them. Faye is distraught when Seb falls off a ladder. Anna and Tim find out that Seb may have [[HIV]] from his ex-girlfriend, which Faye might have. Seb tells Anna that he and Faye never have unprotected sex, but a condom did split. Faye calls the police on Anna after Seb says Anna pushed him and Faye is told about Seb having HIV and that she requires a test by Anna, Tim and Sally. Faye's result is negative whilst Seb is positive and Faye is determined to stand by Seb. Sally allows Seb to move in with her and admits she called social services, but Seb understands Sally's reasons and decides to stay. Anna is arrested by the police again when Pat convinces Seb that she was responsible. Prior to her bail hearing, Gary is annoyed that Faye is starting to believe Phelan and Anna is refused bail. Faye refuses to live with Tim or Gary, choosing to stay with Seb at Pat's. Faye refuses to listen to Gary's negative views on Phelan, but he tells Faye that Pat raped Anna once. Gary explains that Pat forced Anna to have sex as he put their family in debt and was overworking him and Owen, but Faye does not believe it was rape. When Anna collapses in prison, she is taken to hospital but escapes when the prison guard is occupied. Faye notices Phelan's gleeful reaction and confronts him over what happened between him and Anna. Faye breaks up with Seb when he refuses to believe Anna did not push him, siding with Phelan. When Anna arranges to meet Gary in the park, Seb overhears and reports it to Phelan, who calls the police and Faye and Gary ask Craig to warn Anna of police presence, which Craig reluctantly does. Anna escapes and hides in [[Roy Cropper]]'s ([[David Neilson]]) flat and Faye and Gary are reunited with Anna when [[David Platt (Coronation Street)|David Platt]] ([[Jack P. Shepherd]]) catches her there but agrees to keep quiet. Anna accidentally hits [[Eileen Grimshaw|Eileen Phelan]] ([[Sue Cleaver]]) over the head when she tries to find proof at the yard that Phelan is lying and when he returns, he calls the police and Anna flees with Faye. Anna and Faye are tracked down by the police and Faye is taken back to Gary. At Anna's trial, Seb tells the court Anna was not responsible for his injuries, but she is found guilty and sent to prison. Seb disappears and Faye figures out he staying with Phelan's daughter, [[Nicola Rubinstein]] ([[Nicola Thorp]]), and Phelan follows Faye, who tells Phelan she is seeking advice from Nicola on bullying. Tim moves Faye away from Weatherfield to stay with his father, [[Geoff Metcalfe]] ([[Ian Bartholomew]]). Eventually, Faye returns to the street to live with Tim and Sally.\n\n==Casting==\nThe character of Faye is created as a potential adoptive child for Anna and Eddie Windass. The casting of Ellie Leach was announced in January 2011. Of her casting, her cousin, co-star [[Brooke Vincent]], said \"I am chuffed to bits for her. She has made me so happy.
