{"title_page": "Translation studies", "text_new": "{{For|a journal|Translation Studies (journal)}}\n{{Translation sidebar}}\n\n'''Translation studies''' is an academic interdiscipline dealing with the systematic study of the theory, description and application of [[translation]], [[interpreting]], and [[Language localisation|localization]]. As an interdiscipline, Translation Studies borrows much from the various fields of study that support translation. These include [[comparative literature]], [[computer science]], [[history]], [[linguistics]], [[philology]], [[philosophy]], [[semiotics]], and [[terminology]].\n\nThe term ''translation studies'' was coined by the Amsterdam-based American scholars[[James pS. Holmes]] in his paper \"The name and nature of translation studies\",<ref>[[James S. Holmes|Holmes, James S.]] (1972/1988). ''The Name and Nature of Translation Studies''. In Holmes, ''Translated! Papers on Literary Translation and Translation Studies'', Amsterdam: Rodopi, pp. 67\u201380.</ref> which is considered a foundational statement for the discipline.<ref>Munday, Jeremy. 2008. ''Introducing Translation Studies''. London and New York: Routledge. pp. 4</ref> In English, writers occasionally use the term '''translatology''' (and less commonly '''traductology''') to refer to translation studies, and the corresponding French term for the discipline is usually ''traductologie'' (as in the  Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Fran\u00e7aise de Traductologie). In the United States there is a preference for the term ''Translation and Interpreting Studies'' (as in the [http://www.atisa.org/ American Translation and Interpreting Studies Association]), although European tradition includes interpreting within translation studies (as in the [[European Society for Translation Studies]]).\n\n==History==\n===Early studies===\nHistorically, translation studies has long been ''prescriptive'' (telling translators how to translate), to the point that discussions of translation that were not prescriptive were generally not considered to be about translation at all. When historians of translation studies trace early Western thought about translation, for example, they most often set the beginning at [[Cicero]]'s remarks on how he used translation from Greek to Latin to improve his oratorical abilities\u2014an early description of what [[Jerome]] ended up calling [[sense-for-sense translation]]. The descriptive history of interpreters in Egypt provided by [[Herodotus]] several centuries earlier is typically not thought of as translation studies\u2014presumably because it does not tell translators how to translate. In [[China]], the discussion on [[Chinese translation theory|how to translate]] originated with the translation of [[Silk Road transmission of Buddhism|Buddhist sutras]] during the [[Han Dynasty]].\n\n===Calls for an academic discipline===\nIn 1958, at the Second Congress of Slavists in Moscow, the debate between linguistic and literary approaches to translation reached a point where it was proposed that the best thing might be to have a separate science that was able to study all forms of translation, without being wholly within Linguistics or wholly within Literary Studies.<ref>Cary, Edmond. 1959. '\"Murimi James\". Introduction \u00e0 la th\u00e9orie de la traduction.\" Babel 5, p. 19n.</ref> Within Comparative Literature, translation workshops were promoted in the 1960s in some American universities like the [[University of Iowa]] and [[Princeton University|Princeton]].<ref>Munday, Jeremy. 2008. ''Introducing Translation Studies''. London and New York: Routledge. pp. 8</ref>\nDuring the 1950s and 1960s, systematic linguistic-oriented studies of translation began to appear. In 1958, the French linguists [[Jean-Paul Vinay]] and Jean Darbelnet carried out a contrastive comparison of French and English.<ref>Vinay, Jean-Paul and J.Darbelnet. 1958/1995. ''Comparative Stylistics of French and English: A Methodology for Translation''. Amsterdam and Philadelphia: John Benjamins.</ref> In 1964, [[Eugene Nida]] published ''Toward a Science of Translating'', a manual for [[Bible translation]] influenced to some extent by [[Zellig Harris|Harris]]'s [[transformational grammar]].<ref>Nida, Eugene. 1964. ''Toward a Science of Translating''. Leiden: Murimi James.</ref> In 1965, [[J. C. Catford]] theorized translation from a linguistic perspective.<ref>Catford, J.C., (1965). ''A Linguistic Theory of Translation''. London: Longman.</ref> In the 1960s and early 1970s, the Czech scholar [[Ji\u0159\u00ed Lev\u00fd]] and the Slovak scholars [[Anton Popovi\u010d]] and Franti\u0161ek Miko worked on the stylistics of literary translation.<ref>[[Ji\u0159\u00ed Lev\u00fd|Lev\u00fd, Ji\u0159\u00ed]] (1967). ''Translation as a Decision Process''. In ''To Honor Roman Jakobson''. The Hague: Mouton, II, pp.&nbsp;1171\u20131182.</ref>\n\nThese initial steps toward research on literary translation were collected in James S. Holmes' paper at the Third International Congress of Applied Linguistics held in [[Copenhagen]] in 1972. In that paper, \"The name and nature of translation studies\", Holmes asked for the consolidation of a separate discipline and proposed a classification of the field. A visual \"map\" of Holmes' proposal would later be presented by [[Gideon Toury]] in his 1995 ''Descriptive Translation Studies and beyond''.<ref>[[Gideon Toury|Toury, Gideon]] (1995). ''Descriptive Translation Studies and beyond''. Amsterdam and Philadelphia: John Benjamins.</ref>\n\nPrior to the 1990s, translation scholars tended to form particular schools of thought, particularly within the prescriptive, descriptive, and Skopos paradigms. Since the \"cultural turn\" in the 1990s, the discipline has tended to divide into separate fields of inquiry, where research projects run parallel to each other, borrowing methodologies from each other and from other academic disciplines.\n\n==Schools of thought==\nThe main schools of thought on the level of research have tended to cluster around key theoretical concepts, most of which have become objects of debate.\n\n===Equivalence===\nThrough to the 1950s and 1960s, discussions in translation studies tended to concern how best to attain \"equivalence\". The term \"equivalence\" had two distinct meanings, corresponding to different schools of thought. In the Russian tradition, \"equivalence\" was usually a one-to-one correspondence between linguistic forms, or a pair of authorized technical terms or phrases, such that \"equivalence\" was opposed to a range of \"substitutions\". However, in the French tradition of Vinay and Darbelnet, drawing on [[Charles Bally|Bally]], \"equivalence\" was the attainment of equal functional value, generally requiring ''changes'' in form. [[J. C. Catford|Catford]]'s notion of equivalence in 1965 was as in the French tradition. In the course of the 1970s, Russian theorists adopted the wider sense of \"equivalence\" as something ''resulting'' from [[linguistic transformation]]s.\n\nAt about the same time, the ''[[The Interpretive Theory of Translation|Interpretive Theory of Translation]]''<ref>Lederer Marianne (2003). ''Translation \u2013 The Interpretive Model'', Manchester: St. Jerome.</ref> introduced the notion of deverbalized sense into translation studies, drawing a distinction between word correspondences and sense equivalences, and showing the difference between dictionary definitions of words and phrases (word correspondences) and the sense of texts or fragments thereof in a given context (sense equivalences).\n\nThe discussions of equivalence accompanied typologies of translation solutions (also called \"procedures\", \"techniques\" or \"strategies\"), as in Fedorov (1953) and Vinay and Darbelnet (1958). In 1958 Loh Dianyang's ''Translation: Its Principles and Techniques'' (\u82f1\u6c49\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u6280\u5de7) drew on Fedorov and English linguistics to present a typology of translation solutions between Chinese and English.\n\nIn these traditions, discussions of the ways to attain equivalence have mostly been prescriptive and have been related to translator training.\n\n===Descriptive translation studies===\nDescriptive translation studies <!-- I deleted the parenthesis because the term \"descriptive translation studies\" was not coined by Toury. It goes back to at least Holmes' 1975 essay, \"The Name and Nature of Translation Studies\", where the term \"descriptive translation studies\" is used: \"The two branches of pure translation studies concerning themselves with these objectives can be designated descriptive translation studies (DTS) or translation description (TD) and theoretical translation studies (ThTS) or translation theory (TTh).\" - Holmes, James S 1988 (1975). \"The Name and Nature of Translation Studies\". In: James S Holmes 1988. Translated!: Papers on Literary Translation and Translation Studies. Amsterdam: Rodopi, pp. 66-80. https://www.tau.ac.il/tarbut/tirgum/holmes75.htm. -->aims at building an empirical descriptive discipline, to fill one section of the Holmes map. The idea that scientific methodology could be applicable to cultural products had been developed by the Russian Formalists in the early years of the 20th century, and had been recovered by various researchers in [[comparative literature|Comparative Literature]]. It was now applied to literary translation. Part of this application was the theory of polysystems (Even-Zohar 1990<ref>Even-Zohar, I. (1990b) \"Polysystem theory,\" Poetics Today 11(1): 9-26 LINK</ref>) in which translated literature is seen as a sub-system of the receiving or target literary system. Gideon Toury bases his theory on the need to consider translations as \"facts of the target culture\" for the purposes of research. The concepts of \"manipulation\"<ref>Hermans, T. (ed.) .1985. 'The Manipulation of Literature: Studies in Literary Translation'. London and Sydney: Croom Helm.</ref> and \"patronage\"<ref>Lefevere, A. 1992. 'Translation, Rewriting, and the Manipulation of Literary Fame'. London and New York: Routledge.</ref> have also been developed in relation to literary translations.\n\n===''Skopos'' theory===\nAnother paradigm shift in translation theory can be dated from 1984 in Europe. That year saw the publication of two books in German: ''Foundation for a General Theory of Translation'' by [[Katharina Reiss]] (also written Rei\u00df) and [[Hans Vermeer]],<ref>[[Katharina Reiss|Reiss, Katharina]] (1989). \"Text Types, Translation Types and Translation Assessment.\" In: Chesterman, Andrew (ed.) (1989). ''Readings in Translation Theory''. Helsinki: Finn Lectura</ref> and ''Translatorial Action'' (Translatorisches Handeln) by Justa Holz-M\u00e4ntt\u00e4ri.<ref>Pym, Anthony. 2008. Exploring Translation Theories. London and New York: Routledge. 47</ref> From these two came what is known as   [[Skopos theory]], which gives priority to the purpose to be fulfilled by the translation instead of prioritizing equivalence.\n\n===Cultural translation===\nThe cultural turn meant still another step forward in the development of the discipline. It was sketched by [[Susan Bassnett]] and [[Andr\u00e9 Lefevere]] in ''Translation - History - Culture'', and quickly represented by the exchanges between translation studies and other area studies and concepts: [[gender studies]], cannibalism, post-colonialism<ref>[[Douglas Robinson (academic)|Robinson, Douglas]]. (1997). ''Translation and Empire: Postcolonial Theories Explained.'' Manchester: St. Jerome.</ref> or cultural studies, among others.\n\nThe concept of ''cultural translation'' largely ensues from [[Homi K. Bhabha|Homi Bhabha]]'s reading of [[Salman Rushdie]] in ''The Location of Culture''.<ref>London and New York: Routledge, 1994.</ref> [[Cultural translation]] is a concept used in [[cultural studies]] to denote the process of transformation, linguistic or otherwise, in a given [[culture]]. The concept uses linguistic translation as a tool or metaphor in analyzing the nature of transformation and interchange in cultures. \"Nonetheless, despite the fact that translation brings cultures nearer, in each translation, there will be a definite deformation between cultures.\".{{clarify|reason=what does this quotation refer to?|date=September 2017}}\n\n==Fields of inquiry==\n===Translation history===\nTranslation history concerns the history of translators as a professional and social group, as well as the history of translations as indicators of the way cultures develop, interact, and may die. Some principles for translation history have been proposed by Lieven D'hulst<ref>D'hulst, L. (2014). Essais d'histoire de la traduction. Avatars de Janus. Paris: Classiques Garnier.</ref> and [[Anthony Pym|Pym]].<ref>Pym, Anthony. 1998/2014. Method in Translation History. London and New York: Routledge.</ref> Major projects in translation history have included the [https://global.oup.com/academic/content/series/o/oxford-history-of-literary-translation-in-english-hlte/?cc=es&lang=en& Oxford History of Literary Translation in English] and [http://editions-verdier.fr/livre/histoire-des-traductions-en-langue-francaise/ Histoire des traductions en langue fran\u00e7aise].\n\nHistorical anthologies of translation theories have been compiled by [[Douglas Robinson (academic)|Robinson]] (2002)<ref>Robinson, Douglas, ed.

Anthology on Chinese Discourse on Translation. Manchester: Saint Jerome.</ref> for Chinese.\n\n===Sociologies of translation===\nThe sociology of translation includes the study of who translators are, what their forms of work are (workplace studies), and what data on translations can say about the movements of ideas between languages.\n\n===Postcolonial translation studies===\nPostcolonial studies look at translations between a metropolis and former colonies, or within complex former colonies.<ref>Robinson, Douglas. 1997. Translation and Empire: Postcolonial Approaches Explained. Manchester: St. Jerome.</ref> They radically question the assumption that translation occurs between cultures and languages that are radically separated.\n\n===Gender studies===\nGender studies look at the sexuality of translators,<ref>von Flotow, Luise. 2011. Translating women. Ottawa: University of Ottawa Press.</ref> at the gendered nature of the texts they translate,<ref>Simon, Sherry. 1996. Gender in translation. London and New York: Routledge; Von Flotow, Luise. 1997. Translation and gender: translating in the \"era of feminism\" . Manchester: St. Jerome;</ref> at the possibly gendered translation processes employed, and at the gendered metaphors used to describe translation. Pioneering studies are by Luise von Flotow, {{Interlanguage link multi|Sherry Simon|de}}, and Keith Harvey.<ref>Harvey, Keith. 1998. \"Translating Camp Talk,\" in Translation and Minority, ed. Lawrence Venuti (Manchester,: St. Jerome), 295-320.</ref> The effacement or inability to efface threatening forms of same-sex sexuality is a topic taken up, when for instance ancient writers are translated by Renaissance thinkers in a Christian context.<ref>Reeser, Todd W. 2016. ''Setting Plato Straight: Translating Ancient Sexuality in the Renaissance''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press.</ref>\n\n===Ethics===\nIn the field of ethics, much discussed publications have been the essays of [[Antoine Berman]] and [[Lawrence Venuti]] that differ in some aspects but agree on the idea of emphasizing the differences between source and target language and culture when translating. Both are interested in how the \"cultural other [...] can best preserve [...] that otherness\".<ref>[[Lawrence Venuti|Venuti, Lawrence]] (1995). ''The Translator's Invisibility: A History of Translation''. London and New York: Routledge. P. 306. ([http://www.freewebs.com/dennis_rusu/the%20translator 's%20invisibility.%20history%20of%20translation.pdf Read full version here]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }})</ref> In more recent studies scholars have applied [[Emmanuel Levinas]]\u2019 philosophical work on ethics and subjectivity on this issue.<ref>Larkosh, Christopher (2004): \"Levinas, Latin American Thought and the Futures of Translational Ethics.\" [[TTR: traduction, terminologie, r\u00e9daction]].  Vol. 17, n\u00ba 2, 27-44</ref> As his publications have been interpreted in different ways, various conclusions on his concept of ethical responsibility have been drawn from this. Some have come to the assumption that the idea of translation itself could be ethically doubtful, while others receive it as a call for considering the relationship between [[author]] or text and [[Translation#Translators|translator]] as more interpersonal, thus making it an equal and reciprocal process.\n\nParallel to these studies the general recognition of the translator's responsibility has increased. More and more translators and interpreters are being seen as active participants in geopolitical conflicts, which raises the question of how to act ethically independent from their own identity or judgement. This leads to the conclusion that translating and interpreting cannot be considered solely as a process of [[language transfer]], but also as socially and politically directed activities.<ref>Inghilleri, Moira; Maier, Carol. 2001. \"Ethics.\" In: ''Routledge Encyclopedia of Translation Studies.'' New York & London: Routledge.</ref>\n\nThere is general agreement on the need for an ethical [[Ethical code#Code of practice (professional ethics)|code of practice]] providing some guiding principles to reduce uncertainties and improve professionalism, as having been stated in other disciplines (for example [[military medical ethics]] or [[legal ethics]]). However, as there is still no clear understanding of the concept of [[ethics]] in this field, opinions about the particular appearance of such a code vary considerably.\n\n===Audiovisual translation studies===\n[[Multimedia translation|Audiovisual translation]] studies (AVT) is concerned with [[translation]] that takes place in audio and/or visual settings, such as the cinema, television, video games and also some live events such as opera performances.<ref>Pedersen, Jan. 2010. \"Audiovisual Translation \u2013 In General and in Scandinavia\".</ref> The common denominator for studies in this field is that translation is carried out on multiple semiotic systems, as the translated texts (so-called polysemiotic texts<ref>Gottlieb, Henrik. 2001. Screen Translation: Six studies in subtitling, dubbing and voice-over.</ref>) have messages that are conveyed through more than one [[semiotic]] channel, i.e. not just through the written or spoken word, but also via sound and/or images.<ref>P\u00e9rez-Gonz\u00e1lez. Luis. 2014. Audiovisual Translation \u2013 Theories, Methods and Issues. London & New York: Routledge</ref> The main translation modes under study are [[subtitling]], [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbing]] and [[voice-over]], but also [[surtitling]] for the opera and theatre.<ref>Vervecken, Anika. 2012. \"Surtitling for the Stage and Directors\u2019 Attitude: Room for Change\".</ref>\n\nMedia accessibility studies is often considered a part of this field as well,<ref>Remael, Aline, Pilar Orero & Mary Carroll. 2012. Audiovisual Translation and Media Accessibility at the Crossroads: Media for All 3. Amsterdam & New York: Rodopi.</ref> with [[Audio description | audio description for the blind and partially sighted]] and [[subtitling#SDH|subtitles for the deaf or hard-of-hearing]] being the main objects of study. The various conditions and constraints imposed by the different media forms and translation modes, which influence how translation is carried out, are often at the heart of most studies of the product or process of AVT. Many researchers in the field of AVT Studies are organized in the European Association for Studies in Screen Translation ([[ESIST]]), as are many practitioners in the field.\n\n===Non-professional translation===\nNon-professional translation refers to the translation activities performed by translators who are not working professionally, usually in ways made possible by the Internet.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite journal|last1=O'Hagan|first1=Minako|title=Community Translation: Translation as a social activity and its possible consequences in the advent of Web 2.0 and beyond|journal=Linguistica Antverpiensia|date=2011|volume=10|url=https://lans-tts.uantwerpen.be/index.php/LANS-TTS/article/view/275}}</ref> These practices have mushroomed with the recent [[democratization of technology]] and the popularization of the Internet. Volunteer translation initiatives have emerged all around the world, and deal with the translations of various types of written and multimedia products.\n\nNormally, it is not required for volunteers to have been trained in translation, but trained translators could also participate, such as the case of Translators without Borders.<ref>{{cite web|title=Translators without Borders|url=https://twb.translationcenter.org/}}</ref>\n\nDepending on the feature that each scholar considers the most important, different terms have been used to label ''non-professional translation''. O'Hagan has used ''user-generated translation'',<ref>{{cite journal|last1=O'Hagan|first1=Minako|title=.

These practices are mostly supported by a strong and consolidated fan base, although larger non-professional translation projects normally apply [[Crowdsourcing]] models and are controlled by companies or organizations. Since 2008 [[Facebook]] has used [[crowdsourcing]] to have its website translated by its users, and [[TED conference]] has set up the open translation project TED Translators<ref>{{cite web|title=TED Open Translation Project|url=https://www.ted.com/about/programs-initiatives/ted-translators}}</ref> in which volunteers use the Amara<ref>{{cite web|title=Amara|url=https://amara.org/}}</ref> platform to create subtitles online for TED talks.\n\n===Localization===\nStudies of [[language localization|localization]] concern the way the contemporary language industries translate and adapt (\"localize\") technical texts across languages, tailoring them for a specific \"[[Locale (computer software)|locale]]\" (a target location defined by language variety and various cultural parameters). Localization usually concerns software, product documentation, websites and [[Game localization|video games]], where the technological component is key.\n\nA key concept in localization is [[localization and internationalization|internationalization]], in which the start product is stripped of its culture-specific features in such a way that it can be simultaneously localized into several languages.\n\n===Translator education===\n===Interpreting Studies===\nThe discipline of Interpreting Studies is often referred to as the sister of Translation Studies. This is due to the similarities between the two disciplines, consisting in the transfer of ideas from one language into another. Indeed, interpreting as an activity was long seen as a specialized form of translation, before scientifically founded Interpreting Studies emancipated gradually from Translation Studies in the second half of the 20th century. While they were strongly oriented towards the theoretic framework of Translation Studies,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kade|first1=Otto|title=Zufall und Ges\u00e4tzm\u00e4\u00dfigkeit in der \u00dcbersetzung|date=1968|publisher=Leipzig Verl.

Interpreting Studies have developed several approaches and undergone various paradigm shifts,<ref>{{cite journal|last1=P\u00f6chhacker|first1=Franz|title=The turns of Interpreting Studies|journal=Efforts and Models in Interpreting and Translation Research: A Tribute to Daniel Gile|date=2009|issue=ed.

In 1995, a study of 60 countries revealed there were 250 bodies at university level offering courses in translation or interpreting.<ref>Caminade, M. and A.

The visibility acquired by translation has also led to the development of national and international associations of translation studies. Ten of these associations formed the [http://www.est-translationstudies.org/news/2016_INTISA.html International Network of Translation and Interpreting Studies Associations (INTISA)] in September 2016.\n\nThe growing variety of paradigms is mentioned as one of the possible sources of conflict in the discipline. As early as 1999, the conceptual gap between non-essentialist and empirical approaches came up for debate at the Vic Forum on Training Translators and Interpreters: New Directions for the Millennium. The discussants, Rosemary Arrojo and [[Andrew Chesterman]], explicitly sought common shared ground for both approaches.<ref>Chesterman, A. and R. Arrojo (2000), \u2018Shared ground in translation studies\u2019, ''Target'' 12.1:151\u201360.</ref>\n\nInterdisciplinarity has made the creation of new paradigms possible, as most of the developed theories grew from contact with other disciplines like linguistics, comparative literature, cultural studies, philosophy, sociology or historiography. At the same time, it might have provoked the fragmentation of translation studies as a discipline on its own right.<ref>Gile, Daniel. 2004 \"Translation research versus interpreting research: kinship, differences and prospects for partnership\".

As the prescriptivism of the earlier studies gives room to descriptivism and theorization, professionals see less applicability of the studies. At the same time, university research assessment places little if any importance on translation practice.<ref>Munday 2010. p.15.</ref>\n\nTranslation studies has shown a tendency to broaden its fields of inquiry, and this trend may be expected to continue.

As an interdiscipline, Translation Studies borrows much from the various fields of study that support translation. These include [[comparative literature]], [[computer science]], [[history]], [[linguistics]], [[philology]], [[philosophy]], [[semiotics]], and [[terminology]].\n\nThe term ''translation studies'' was coined by the Amsterdam-based American scholar [[James S. Holmes]] in his paper \"The name and nature of translation studies\",<ref>[[James S. Holmes|Holmes, James S.]] (1972/1988). ''The Name and Nature of Translation Studies''. In Holmes, ''Translated! Papers on Literary Translation and Translation Studies'', Amsterdam: Rodopi, pp. 67\u201380.</ref> which is considered a foundational statement for the discipline.<ref>Munday, Jeremy. 2008. ''Introducing Translation Studies''. London and New York: Routledge. pp. 4</ref> In English, writers occasionally use the term '''translatology''' (and less commonly '''traductology''') to refer to translation studies, and the corresponding French term for the discipline is usually ''traductologie'' (as in the  Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Fran\u00e7aise de Traductologie). In the United States there is a preference for the term ''Translation and Interpreting Studies'' (as in the [http://www.atisa.org/ American Translation and Interpreting Studies Association]), although European tradition includes interpreting within translation studies (as in the [[European Society for Translation Studies]]).\n\n==History==\n===Early studies===\nHistorically, translation studies has long been ''prescriptive'' (telling translators how to translate), to the point that discussions of translation that were not prescriptive were generally not considered to be about translation at all. When historians of translation studies trace early Western thought about translation, for example, they most often set the beginning at [[Cicero]]'s remarks on how he used translation from Greek to Latin to improve his oratorical abilities\u2014an early description of what [[Jerome]] ended up calling [[sense-for-sense translation]]. The descriptive history of interpreters in Egypt provided by [[Herodotus]] several centuries earlier is typically not thought of as translation studies\u2014presumably because it does not tell translators how to translate. In [[China]], the discussion on [[Chinese translation theory|how to translate]] originated with the translation of [[Silk Road transmission of Buddhism|Buddhist sutras]] during the [[Han Dynasty]].\n\n===Calls for an academic discipline===\nIn 1958, at the Second Congress of Slavists in Moscow, the debate between linguistic and literary approaches to translation reached a point where it was proposed that the best thing might be to have a separate science that was able to study all forms of translation, without being wholly within Linguistics or wholly within Literary Studies.<ref>Cary, Edmond. 1959. '\"Murimi James\". Introduction \u00e0 la th\u00e9orie de la traduction.\" Babel 5, p. 19n.</ref> Within Comparative Literature, translation workshops were promoted in the 1960s in some American universities like the [[University of Iowa]] and [[Princeton University|Princeton]].<ref>Munday, Jeremy. 2008. ''Introducing Translation Studies''. London and New York: Routledge. pp. 8</ref>\nDuring the 1950s and 1960s, systematic linguistic-oriented studies of translation began to appear. In 1958, the French linguists [[Jean-Paul Vinay]] and Jean Darbelnet carried out a contrastive comparison of French and English.<ref>Vinay, Jean-Paul and J.Darbelnet. 1958/1995. ''Comparative Stylistics of French and English: A Methodology for Translation''. Amsterdam and Philadelphia: John Benjamins.</ref> In 1964, [[Eugene Nida]] published ''Toward a Science of Translating'', a manual for [[Bible translation]] influenced to some extent by [[Zellig Harris|Harris]]'s [[transformational grammar]].<ref>Nida, Eugene. 1964. ''Toward a Science of Translating''. Leiden: Murimi James.</ref> In 1965, [[J. C. Catford]] theorized translation from a linguistic perspective.<ref>Catford, J.C., (1965). ''A Linguistic Theory of Translation''. London: Longman.</ref> In the 1960s and early 1970s, the Czech scholar [[Ji\u0159\u00ed Lev\u00fd]] and the Slovak scholars [[Anton Popovi\u010d]] and Franti\u0161ek Miko worked on the stylistics of literary translation.<ref>[[Ji\u0159\u00ed Lev\u00fd|Lev\u00fd, Ji\u0159\u00ed]] (1967). ''Translation as a Decision Process''. In ''To Honor Roman Jakobson''. The Hague: Mouton, II, pp.&nbsp;1171\u20131182.</ref>\n\nThese initial steps toward research on literary translation were collected in James S. Holmes' paper at the Third International Congress of Applied Linguistics held in [[Copenhagen]] in 1972. In that paper, \"The name and nature of translation studies\", Holmes asked for the consolidation of a separate discipline and proposed a classification of the field. A visual \"map\" of Holmes' proposal would later be presented by [[Gideon Toury]] in his 1995 ''Descriptive Translation Studies and beyond''.<ref>[[Gideon Toury|Toury, Gideon]] (1995). ''Descriptive Translation Studies and beyond''. Amsterdam and Philadelphia: John Benjamins.</ref>\n\nPrior to the 1990s, translation scholars tended to form particular schools of thought, particularly within the prescriptive, descriptive, and Skopos paradigms. Since the \"cultural turn\" in the 1990s, the discipline has tended to divide into separate fields of inquiry, where research projects run parallel to each other, borrowing methodologies from each other and from other academic disciplines.\n\n==Schools of thought==\nThe main schools of thought on the level of research have tended to cluster around key theoretical concepts, most of which have become objects of debate.\n\n===Equivalence===\nThrough to the 1950s and 1960s, discussions in translation studies tended to concern how best to attain \"equivalence\". The term \"equivalence\" had two distinct meanings, corresponding to different schools of thought. In the Russian tradition, \"equivalence\" was usually a one-to-one correspondence between linguistic forms, or a pair of authorized technical terms or phrases, such that \"equivalence\" was opposed to a range of \"substitutions\". However, in the French tradition of Vinay and Darbelnet, drawing on [[Charles Bally|Bally]], \"equivalence\" was the attainment of equal functional value, generally requiring ''changes'' in form. [[J. C. Catford|Catford]]'s notion of equivalence in 1965 was as in the French tradition. In the course of the 1970s, Russian theorists adopted the wider sense of \"equivalence\" as something ''resulting'' from [[linguistic transformation]]s.\n\nAt about the same time, the ''[[The Interpretive Theory of Translation|Interpretive Theory of Translation]]''<ref>Lederer Marianne (2003). ''Translation \u2013 The Interpretive Model'', Manchester: St. Jerome.</ref> introduced the notion of deverbalized sense into translation studies, drawing a distinction between word correspondences and sense equivalences, and showing the difference between dictionary definitions of words and phrases (word correspondences) and the sense of texts or fragments thereof in a given context (sense equivalences).\n\nThe discussions of equivalence accompanied typologies of translation solutions (also called \"procedures\", \"techniques\" or \"strategies\"), as in Fedorov (1953) and Vinay and Darbelnet (1958). In 1958 Loh Dianyang's ''Translation: Its Principles and Techniques'' (\u82f1\u6c49\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u6280\u5de7) drew on Fedorov and English linguistics to present a typology of translation solutions between Chinese and English.\n\nIn these traditions, discussions of the ways to attain equivalence have mostly been prescriptive and have been related to translator training.\n\n===Descriptive translation studies===\nDescriptive translation studies <!-- I deleted the parenthesis because the term \"descriptive translation studies\" was not coined by Toury. It goes back to at least Holmes' 1975 essay, \"The Name and Nature of Translation Studies\", where the term \"descriptive translation studies\" is used: \"The two branches of pure translation studies concerning themselves with these objectives can be designated descriptive translation studies (DTS) or translation description (TD) and theoretical translation studies (ThTS) or translation theory (TTh).\" - Holmes, James S 1988 (1975). \"The Name and Nature of Translation Studies\". In: James S Holmes 1988. Translated!: Papers on Literary Translation and Translation Studies. Amsterdam: Rodopi, pp. 66-80. https://www.tau.ac.il/tarbut/tirgum/holmes75.htm. -->aims at building an empirical descriptive discipline, to fill one section of the Holmes map. The idea that scientific methodology could be applicable to cultural products had been developed by the Russian Formalists in the early years of the 20th century, and had been recovered by various researchers in [[comparative literature|Comparative Literature]]. It was now applied to literary translation. Part of this application was the theory of polysystems (Even-Zohar 1990<ref>Even-Zohar, I. (1990b) \"Polysystem theory,\" Poetics Today 11(1): 9-26 LINK</ref>) in which translated literature is seen as a sub-system of the receiving or target literary system. Gideon Toury bases his theory on the need to consider translations as \"facts of the target culture\" for the purposes of research. The concepts of \"manipulation\"<ref>Hermans, T. (ed.) .1985. 'The Manipulation of Literature: Studies in Literary Translation'. London and Sydney: Croom Helm.</ref> and \"patronage\"<ref>Lefevere, A. 1992. 'Translation, Rewriting, and the Manipulation of Literary Fame'. London and New York: Routledge.</ref> have also been developed in relation to literary translations.\n\n===''Skopos'' theory===\nAnother paradigm shift in translation theory can be dated from 1984 in Europe. That year saw the publication of two books in German: ''Foundation for a General Theory of Translation'' by [[Katharina Reiss]] (also written Rei\u00df) and [[Hans Vermeer]],<ref>[[Katharina Reiss|Reiss, Katharina]] (1989). \"Text Types, Translation Types and Translation Assessment.\" In: Chesterman, Andrew (ed.) (1989). ''Readings in Translation Theory''. Helsinki: Finn Lectura</ref> and ''Translatorial Action'' (Translatorisches Handeln) by Justa Holz-M\u00e4ntt\u00e4ri.<ref>Pym, Anthony. 2008. Exploring Translation Theories. London and New York: Routledge. 47</ref> From these two came what is known as   [[Skopos theory]], which gives priority to the purpose to be fulfilled by the translation instead of prioritizing equivalence.\n\n===Cultural translation===\nThe cultural turn meant still another step forward in the development of the discipline. It was sketched by [[Susan Bassnett]] and [[Andr\u00e9 Lefevere]] in ''Translation - History - Culture'', and quickly represented by the exchanges between translation studies and other area studies and concepts: [[gender studies]], cannibalism, post-colonialism<ref>[[Douglas Robinson (academic)|Robinson, Douglas]]. (1997). ''Translation and Empire: Postcolonial Theories Explained.'' Manchester: St. Jerome.</ref> or cultural studies, among others.\n\nThe concept of ''cultural translation'' largely ensues from [[Homi K. Bhabha|Homi Bhabha]]'s reading of [[Salman Rushdie]] in ''The Location of Culture''.<ref>London and New York: Routledge, 1994.</ref> [[Cultural translation]] is a concept used in [[cultural studies]] to denote the process of transformation, linguistic or otherwise, in a given [[culture]]. The concept uses linguistic translation as a tool or metaphor in analyzing the nature of transformation and interchange in cultures. \"Nonetheless, despite the fact that translation brings cultures nearer, in each translation, there will be a definite deformation between cultures.\".{{clarify|reason=what does this quotation refer to?|date=September 2017}}\n\n==Fields of inquiry==\n===Translation history===\nTranslation history concerns the history of translators as a professional and social group, as well as the history of translations as indicators of the way cultures develop, interact, and may die. Some principles for translation history have been proposed by Lieven D'hulst<ref>D'hulst, L. (2014). Essais d'histoire de la traduction. Avatars de Janus. Paris: Classiques Garnier.</ref> and [[Anthony Pym|Pym]].<ref>Pym, Anthony. 1998/2014. Method in Translation History.

Translation and Empire: Postcolonial Approaches Explained. Manchester: St. Jerome.</ref> They radically question the assumption that translation occurs between cultures and languages that are radically separated.\n\n===Gender studies===\nGender studies look at the sexuality of translators,<ref>von Flotow, Luise. 2011.

''Setting Plato Straight: Translating Ancient Sexuality in the Renaissance''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press.</ref>\n\n===Ethics===\nIn the field of ethics, much discussed publications have been the essays of [[Antoine Berman]] and [[Lawrence Venuti]] that differ in some aspects but agree on the idea of emphasizing the differences between source and target language and culture when translating. Both are interested in how the \"cultural other [...] can best preserve [...] that otherness\".<ref>[[Lawrence Venuti|Venuti, Lawrence]] (1995). ''The Translator's Invisibility: A History of Translation''. London and New York: Routledge. P. 306.

Vol. 17, n\u00ba 2, 27-44</ref> As his publications have been interpreted in different ways, various conclusions on his concept of ethical responsibility have been drawn from this. Some have come to the assumption that the idea of translation itself could be ethically doubtful, while others receive it as a call for considering the relationship between [[author]] or text and [[Translation#Translators|translator]] as more interpersonal, thus making it an equal and reciprocal process.\n\nParallel to these studies the general recognition of the translator's responsibility has increased. More and more translators and interpreters are being seen as active participants in geopolitical conflicts, which raises the question of how to act ethically independent from their own identity or judgement. This leads to the conclusion that translating and interpreting cannot be considered solely as a process of [[language transfer]], but also as socially and politically directed activities.<ref>Inghilleri, Moira; Maier, Carol. 2001. \"Ethics.\" In: ''Routledge Encyclopedia of Translation Studies.'' New York & London: Routledge.</ref>\n\nThere is general agreement on the need for an ethical [[Ethical code#Code of practice (professional ethics)|code of practice]] providing some guiding principles to reduce uncertainties and improve professionalism, as having been stated in other disciplines (for example [[military medical ethics]] or [[legal ethics]]). However, as there is still no clear understanding of the concept of [[ethics]] in this field, opinions about the particular appearance of such a code vary considerably.\n\n===Audiovisual translation studies===\n[[Multimedia translation|Audiovisual translation]] studies (AVT) is concerned with [[translation]] that takes place in audio and/or visual settings, such as the cinema, television, video games and also some live events such as opera performances.<ref>Pedersen, Jan. 2010. \"Audiovisual Translation \u2013 In General and in Scandinavia\".</ref> The common denominator for studies in this field is that translation is carried out on multiple semiotic systems, as the translated texts (so-called polysemiotic texts<ref>Gottlieb, Henrik. 2001. Screen Translation: Six studies in subtitling, dubbing and voice-over.</ref>) have messages that are conveyed through more than one [[semiotic]] channel, i.e. not just through the written or spoken word, but also via sound and/or images.<ref>P\u00e9rez-Gonz\u00e1lez. Luis. 2014. Audiovisual Translation \u2013 Theories, Methods and Issues. London & New York: Routledge</ref> The main translation modes under study are [[subtitling]], [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbing]] and [[voice-over]], but also [[surtitling]] for the opera and theatre.<ref>Vervecken, Anika. 2012. \"Surtitling for the Stage and Directors\u2019 Attitude: Room for Change\".</ref>\n\nMedia accessibility studies is often considered a part of this field as well,<ref>Remael, Aline, Pilar Orero & Mary Carroll. 2012. Audiovisual Translation and Media Accessibility at the Crossroads: Media for All 3. Amsterdam & New York: Rodopi.</ref> with [[Audio description | audio description for the blind and partially sighted]] and [[subtitling#SDH|subtitles for the deaf or hard-of-hearing]] being the main objects of study. The various conditions and constraints imposed by the different media forms and translation modes, which influence how translation is carried out, are often at the heart of most studies of the product or process of AVT. Many researchers in the field of AVT Studies are organized in the European Association for Studies in Screen Translation ([[ESIST]]), as are many practitioners in the field.\n\n===Non-professional translation===\nNon-professional translation refers to the translation activities performed by translators who are not working professionally, usually in ways made possible by the Internet.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite journal|last1=O'Hagan|first1=Minako|title=Community Translation: Translation as a social activity and its possible consequences in the advent of Web 2.0 and beyond|journal=Linguistica Antverpiensia|date=2011|volume=10|url=https://lans-tts.uantwerpen.be/index.php/LANS-TTS/article/view/275}}</ref> These practices have mushroomed with the recent [[democratization of technology]] and the popularization of the Internet.

These practices are mostly supported by a strong and consolidated fan base, although larger non-professional translation projects normally apply [[Crowdsourcing]] models and are controlled by companies or organizations.

Localization usually concerns software, product documentation, websites and [[Game localization|video games]], where the technological component is key.\n\nA key concept in localization is [[localization and internationalization|internationalization]], in which the start product is stripped of its culture-specific features in such a way that it can be simultaneously localized into several languages.\n\n===Translator education===\n===Interpreting Studies===\nThe discipline of Interpreting Studies is often referred to as the sister of Translation Studies. This is due to the similarities between the two disciplines, consisting in the transfer of ideas from one language into another. Indeed, interpreting as an activity was long seen as a specialized form of translation, before scientifically founded Interpreting Studies emancipated gradually from Translation Studies in the second half of the 20th century. While they were strongly oriented towards the theoretic framework of Translation Studies,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kade|first1=Otto|title=Zufall und Ges\u00e4tzm\u00e4\u00dfigkeit in der \u00dcbersetzung|date=1968|publisher=Leipzig Verl.

Interpreting Studies have developed several approaches and undergone various paradigm shifts,<ref>{{cite journal|last1=P\u00f6chhacker|first1=Franz|title=The turns of Interpreting Studies|journal=Efforts and Models in Interpreting and Translation Research: A Tribute to Daniel Gile|date=2009|issue=ed.

In 1995, a study of 60 countries revealed there were 250 bodies at university level offering courses in translation or interpreting.<ref>Caminade, M. and A. Pym. 1995. \"Les formations en traduction et interpretation. Essai de recensement mondial\". In ''Traduire''. Paris: Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Fran\u00e7aise des Traducteurs</ref> In 2013, the same database listed 501 translator-training institutions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.est-translationstudies.org/resources/tti/tti.htm|title=Translator-Training Institutions|author=|date=|website=www.est-translationstudies.org|accessdate=19 April 2018}}</ref> Accordingly, there has been a growth in [http://usuaris.tinet.cat/apym/conferences/index.html conferences on translation], [http://www.est-translationstudies.org/resources/journals_index.html translation journals] and translation-related publications. The visibility acquired by translation has also led to the development of national and international associations of translation studies. Ten of these associations formed the [http://www.est-translationstudies.org/news/2016_INTISA.html International Network of Translation and Interpreting Studies Associations (INTISA)] in September 2016.\n\nThe growing variety of paradigms is mentioned as one of the possible sources of conflict in the discipline. As early as 1999, the conceptual gap between non-essentialist and empirical approaches came up for debate at the Vic Forum on Training Translators and Interpreters: New Directions for the Millennium. The discussants, Rosemary Arrojo and [[Andrew Chesterman]], explicitly sought common shared ground for both approaches.<ref>Chesterman, A. and R. Arrojo (2000), \u2018Shared ground in translation studies\u2019, ''Target'' 12.1:151\u201360.</ref>\n\nInterdisciplinarity has made the creation of new paradigms possible, as most of the developed theories grew from contact with other disciplines like linguistics, comparative literature, cultural studies, philosophy, sociology or historiography. At the same time, it might have provoked the fragmentation of translation studies as a discipline on its own right.<ref>Gile, Daniel. 2004 \"Translation research versus interpreting research: kinship, differences and prospects for partnership\". In Christina Sch\u00e4ffner (ed.), \u2018Translation Research and Interpreting Research: Traditions, Gaps and Synergies\u2019. Clevedon: Multilingual Matters. pp. 10\u201334.</ref>\n\nA second source of conflict rises from the breach between theory and practice. As the prescriptivism of the earlier studies gives room to descriptivism and theorization, professionals see less applicability of the studies. At the same time, university research assessment places little if any importance on translation practice.<ref>Munday 2010. p.15.</ref>\n\nTranslation studies has shown a tendency to broaden its fields of inquiry, and this trend may be expected to continue. This particularly concerns extensions into [http://www.adaptation.uk.com/ adaptation studies], intralingual translation, translation between semiotic systems (image to text to music, for example), and translation as the form of all interpretation and thus of all understanding, as suggested in [[On Linguistic Aspects of Translation|the work of Roman Jakobson]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[European Society for Translation Studies]]\n*[[International Doctorate in Translation Studies]]\n*[[Language interpretation]]\n*[[Skopos theory]]\n*[[Translation]]\n*[[Translation criticism]]\n*[[Translation project]]\n*[[:Category:Translation scholars|Translation scholars]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* [[Mona Baker|Baker, Mona]] ed.

It occurred in 1813, following [[Captain (naval)|Captain]] [[David Porter (naval officer)|David Porter]]'s decision to sail his fleet to the island for repairs before continuing his [[commerce raiding|raid]] against British shipping. Upon arrival, the Americans became involved in a tribal war and allied themselves with the [[Te I'i]] people against the [[Happah]] and [[Tai Pi (province)|Tai Pi]] clans.<ref name=\"HistoryNet\">{{cite web|url=http://www.historynet.com/war-of-1812-commodore-david-porter-and-the-essex-in-the-south-pacific.htm|title=War of 1812: Commodore David Porter and the Essex in the South Pacific|work=Military History Magazine|publisher=History Net/Weider History Network|date=June 1994}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\nOperations in the Pacific began in early 1813 when Captain Porter entered the Pacific, via [[Cape Horn]], in the thirty-two gun [[frigate]] {{USS|Essex|1799|6}}. Originally Porter was assigned to rendezvous with two other warships but both encountered enemy resistance before their meeting and Porter went around the Horn alone. The mission was to harass the British whaling industry off South America and around the [[Gal\u00e1pagos Islands]]. For months the Americans cruised the [[Pacific Ocean|South Seas]] and they [[Action off James Island|captured]] several British whalers that they placed under navy command. By October 1813, ''Essex'' was in serious need of repairs so Porter decided to head for Nuku Hiva, an island in the [[Marquesas]], fearing that a British squadron would find him if he chose to take refuge in a South American port. The American fleet that went to the Marquesas included USS ''Essex'' and the liberated American whaler ''Barclay'', and nine captured British whalers: {{ship||Seringapatam|1799 ship|2}} (22 guns), ''Greenwich'' (10 guns), {{ship||Montezuma|1804 ship|2}} (18 guns), ''[[Essex Junior]]'' (16 guns), {{ship||Hector|1809 ship|2}} (11 guns), ''Charlton'' (10 guns), {{ship||Sir Andrew Hammond|1800 ship|2}}, and ''Catherine'' and {{ship||New Zealander|1808 ship|2}}, both of eight guns. In total, Captain Porter had just over 200 [[United States Navy]] officers and sailors, accompanied by a small detachment of no more than twenty [[United States Marine Corps|marines]] under the command of [[Lieutenant]] [[John M. Gamble]]. One of the sailors was the young [[midshipman]] [[David Farragut]], later the first United States Navy [[admiral]]. (Porter's son [[David Dixon Porter]] was the second U.S. Navy admiral.) Additionally, many of the prisoners from the prize enemy ships were Americans and they volunteered for service; some of the British captives too volunteered.<ref name=\"HistoryNet\" />\n\n==Campaign==\n===Founding of Madisonville===\nPorter arrived off Nuku Hiva, on October 25, 1813 and he renamed it Madison's Island after United States President [[James Madison]]. Then Porter began making preparations to establish the first American naval base in the Pacific, as well as a small [[colony]], named [[Madisonville, Nuku Hiva|Madisonville]], to house the sailors. The small [[Fort Madison, Nuku Hiva|Fort Madison]], of four guns, was also constructed on a hill next to [[Massachusetts Bay, Nuku Hiva|Massachusetts Bay]] where an official flag raising ceremony took place on November 19, a seventeen gun salute was fired and some sort of message was buried in the ground for future Europeans to find, should they attempt to colonize the island after Porter and his men left. The declaration stated that the Te I'is were subjects of the United States and that the latter had officially laid claim to the island which Porter hoped would become an important naval base. In this time the sailors also scraped the [[copper sheathing|copper bottom]] hull of ''Essex'' and used smoke to drive out over 1,000 rats hiding in her works. The Americans described the native warriors as being tall and copper colored, with tattoos over their entire bodies. They wore loin cloths and some had capes made of tree bark; the warriors also carried large clubs or spears. The women were clothed in similar fashion to the men, and friendly to the sailors. A half-naked Englishman named Wilson was found to be living on the island, and had been for many years. He served as interpreter between the Americans and the native [[tribal chief|chiefs]].<ref>Boot, pp. 31-34</ref>\n\n===Downes Expedition===\n[[File:Nuku Hiva warrior 1813.jpg|150px|left|thumb|''A warrior of Nuku Hiva'' by [[Wilhelm Gottlieb Tilesius von Tilenau]], 1813]]\nNuku Hiva, at the time, was inhabited by many tribes of indigenous peoples, separated in villages by mountain peaks thousands of feet high. The area of land around Massachusetts Bay, which became the town of Madisonville, was controlled by Chief Gattanewa of the Te I'i and in return for rights to build the base, Gattanewa demanded that the Americans become his allies and help fight the war against the Happah. While the majority of the Americans were still building their settlement, [[Lieutenant]] [[John Downes (naval officer)|John Downes]], Marine Lieutenant John Gamble and a platoon of forty Marines, were ordered to proceed to an in-land [[redoubt]], located high in the mountains. The main effort of this expedition dragged along a wheeled 6 pound cannon for added effect. The amazement of the aboriginals at gunpowder weapons had already been noted upon their landing on the island. Several hundred Te I'i warriors accompanied the expedition which left the coast in the first week of November. After a journey through the jungle Downes and his men found the fort occupied by 3,000 to 4,000 hostiles. The Te I'i and their American allies attacked; during the fighting a rock hit Downes in the stomach, hurting him. A sailor was wounded by a spear to the neck, but he apparently survived. Lt. Gamble was singled out by a heavily built Happah warrior, who charged at him with a wooden club. Drawing his Mameluke sword Gamble blocked the club from knocking him unconscious as another Marine, seeing Gamble struggling, leveled his musket at the Happah's head. The shot, fired from only a foot away, nearly decapitated the warrior.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\nThe assault on the fort was successful and Downes reported that his men had killed five enemies and that the Te I'i massacred the wounded with clubs. Lieutenant Downes also said that he was very surprised that his allies did not eat the dead; instead they used their bones to make necklaces and fan handles. Over the next few days the chiefs of the Happah arrived at the coast to settle a peace agreement. One of the stipulations required the Happah to fight alongside the Te I'i and Americans in another operation against the Tai Pi.<ref>Boot, pp. 34-35</ref>\n\n===Porter expedition===\nNot long after subduing the Happah, the Tai Pi declared war on the Te I'i, the Happah, and the Americans. Thus followed one of the most significant amphibious landings in the history of American operations in the Pacific during the 1800s. It was unopposed but Captain Porter's fleet, combined with around 5,000 friendly warriors, in at least 200 [[canoe|war-canoe]]s, attacked the Tai Pi-held coastline. After that, thirty-six officers and men with a cannon, personally commanded by Porter, led the expedition to a fortress with seven-foot-high walls. A battle began when the Tai Pis ambushed the column in the jungle near the fort. Porter wrote \"''We entered the bushes, and at every instant assailed by spears and stones, which came from different parties in the ambuscade. We could hear the snapping of the slings, the whistling of the stones, and the spears came quivering by us, but we could not percieve [sic] from whom they came.''\" Skirmishing broke out and the expedition continued forward, encountering heavier resistance the farther they went. The column eventually made it to the fort where a pitched battle began that would last for hours. The Te I'is and Happahs provided the brunt of the attack while the Americans picked off enemy warriors with their muskets; the cannon was aimed at the fortifications. Upon arrival, a Marine sergeant notified Lt. Gamble and Capt. Porter of the hopelessness of their situation. The Marines in his squad were down to three or four cartridges of ammunition. Lt. Gamble and four men were given permission to run back to the beach for a resupply but upon their arrival the situation with their natives allies had deteriorated.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\nThousands of Tai Pis occupied the heavily defended position and they managed to repel the native attacks. Near the end of the engagement, the Te I'is and Happahs fled, leaving the thirty-six Americans to fend for themselves. Capt. Porter notified Lt. Gamble to order his Marines to cover the retreat back to the beach. Gamble positioned his men at the edge of a bush for one last decisive volley to ensure a strong enemy force did not pursue them. The American force lost one man killed and two wounded. One of the casualties was Lieutenant Downes, who suffered a badly broken leg. \"''We returned to the beach much fatigued and harassed with marching and fighting,''\" said Porter, who then sailed back to Madisonville.<ref>Boot, pp. 35\u201336</ref>\n\n===Battle of Typee Valley===\n[[File:Atlas pittoresque pl 054.jpg|right|thumb|200px|''An 1846 lithograph of Nuka Hiva.'']]\nOnce word spread that Porter and his allies had been defeated, the Te I'i and the Happah warriors began to turn on the Americans which led them to fear that Madisonville would be overrun and the inhabitants massacred. Porter wrote; \"''I had now no alternative, but to prove our superiority by a successful attack upon the Typees.''\" Porter organized and led most of his men on a second mission into enemy territory, this time overland to [[Typee Valley]] and with limited assistance from the Te I'i. The valley is a dense nine miles across by three miles and was the heartland of the Tai Pi where their villages were located and where they harvested [[coconut]] and [[breadfruit]]. By making a detour to avoid the heavily defended fort near the coast, Porter could make a surprise attack and use terrain and his superior weapons to their advantage. During one night the column marched to the top of a ridge overlooking the valley but because the Americans were exhausted from a long march, Porter decided to wait until the next morning to attack. The following day was rainy and windy according to reports, moisture had temporarily ruined the gunpowder, so the expedition spent another day resting and waiting for the powder to dry. Finally on November 30, the expedition launched their attack and soon after the Americans and Te I'is found themselves in another ambush which they fought off. After that Captain Porter sent the Tai Pi leaders a message advising them to cease hostilities at once or else their villages would be burned. The captain waited for some time and when it became apparent that the message had been ignored, the advance was continued. American forces and the Te I'is eventually won the day when night came and the enemy disengaged. There were no American casualties.<ref>Boot, pp. 36-37</ref>\n\nPorter claimed he took no pleasure in conquering a \"''happy and heroic people''\" and he described the aftermath of the battle as \"''a scene of desolation and horror''\". The captain also wrote that he left behind a \"''line of smoking ruins''\" when he started the return march to Madisonville. Tai Pi emissaries were not far behind and they brought the Americans \"''countless''\" [[hog (swine)|hog]]s as a peace offering. A British magazine later said that Porter was guilty of <blockquote> \"''wantonly murdering unoffending savages''\" to which the captain replied; \"''Many may censure my conduct as wanton and unjust.... But let such reflect on our peculiar situation--a handful of men residing among numerous war-like tribes, liable every moment to be attacked by them and all cut off; our only hopes on safety was in convincing them of our great superiority over them and from what we have already seen, we must either attack them or be attacked.... Wars are not always just, and are rarely free from excesses--my conscience acquits me of any injustice, and no excesses were committed but what the Typees had in their power to stop by ceasing hostilities.''\"<ref name=autogenerated1>Boot, p. 37</ref></blockquote>\n\n===''Seringapatam'' Mutiny===\nBy 9 December 1813, USS ''Essex'' was repaired and ready for sailing. The sailors were not happy about leaving their Marquesan girlfriends and Porter had to suppress one [[mutiny]] by declaring that he \"''would at once put a match to the magazine, and blow them all to eternity.''\" A former Royal Navy sailor by the name of Robert White, was brought before Porter, having been accused of mutinous talk about ''Essex Junior''. White denied the accusations, now confirmed by other sailors, infuriating Porter. Porter thus drew his sword, face turning red, and yelled: \"Run you scoundrel! Run for your life!\" White ran off, jumped overboard, and swam to a nearby canoe.<ref>''Gamble of the Marines'', Raymond J Toner USN</ref>\n\nThe remaining 250 crew members remained loyal and ''Essex'' made sail on 9 December 1813 to continue raiding. Most of the fleet left, though ''Sir Andrew Hammond'', ''Seringapatam'', and ''Greenwich'' remained at Nuku Hiva with Lieutenant John Gamble, two midshipmen, nineteen sailors and six prisoners, with the prisoners and some of the sailors being British nationals.\n\nThe situation was quiet until on 7 May 1814, the British sailors among the [[garrison]] mutinied. First they released the six prisoners and then attacked Fort Madison before taking over ''Seringapatam'' and getting away. Gamble was wounded in the foot and he was left adrift in a small boat with four others but they eventually made it to ''Sir Andrew Hammond''. Meanwhile the British interpreter Wilson was arousing trouble with the Te I'i by telling them that Porter would not come back. A few days later on 9 May, six of the American sailors were attacked on the beach by the Te I'i; a sixteen-year-old midshipman was killed along with four sailors while two others escaped, one of whom was wounded. Meanwhile, Gamble was alone on his ship, recovering from his wounded foot, when two war-canoes approached for an attack. The cannon of the ship were pre-loaded so single handedly Gamble limped from gun to gun, firing them as fast as possible, until the enemy fell back. On the next morning he gave the order to evacuate Madisonville, there being only eight men left on shore and all were either wounded or ill. Thus ended the existence of America's first naval base and colony in the Pacific Ocean. Captain Porter never returned to the island due to his capture by the British at the [[Battle of Valpara\u00edso]] on March 28, 1814.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\n==Post-script==\nThe mutineers sailed ''Seringapatam'' to [[New South Wales]].

It occurred in 1813, following [[Captain (naval)|Captain]] [[David Porter (naval officer)|David Porter]]'s decision to sail his fleet to the island for repairs before continuing his [[commerce raiding|raid]] against British shipping. Upon arrival, the Americans became involved in a tribal war and allied themselves with the [[Te I'i]] people against the [[Happah]] and [[Tai Pi (province)|Tai Pi]] clans.<ref name=\"HistoryNet\">{{cite web|url=http://www.historynet.com/war-of-1812-commodore-david-porter-and-the-essex-in-the-south-pacific.htm|title=War of 1812: Commodore David Porter and the Essex in the South Pacific|work=Military History Magazine|publisher=History Net/Weider History Network|date=June 1994}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\nOperations in the Pacific began in early 1813 when Captain Porter entered the Pacific, via [[Cape Horn]], in the thirty-two gun [[frigate]] {{USS|Essex|1799|6}}. Originally Porter was assigned to rendezvous with two other warships but both encountered enemy resistance before their meeting and Porter went around the Horn alone. The mission was to harass the British whaling industry off South America and around the [[Gal\u00e1pagos Islands]]. For months the Americans cruised the [[Pacific Ocean|South Seas]] and they [[Action off James Island|captured]] several British whalers that they placed under navy command. By October 1813, ''Essex'' was in serious need of repairs so Porter decided to head for Nuku Hiva, an island in the [[Marquesas]], fearing that a British squadron would find him if he chose to take refuge in a South American port. The American fleet that went to the Marquesas included USS ''Essex'' and the liberated American whaler ''Barclay'', and nine captured British whalers: {{ship||Seringapatam|1799 ship|2}} (22 guns), ''Greenwich'' (10 guns), {{ship||Montezuma|1804 ship|2}} (18 guns), ''[[Essex Junior]]'' (16 guns), {{ship||Hector|1809 ship|2}} (11 guns), ''Charlton'' (10 guns), {{ship||Sir Andrew Hammond|1800 ship|2}}, and ''Catherine'' and {{ship||New Zealander|1808 ship|2}}, both of eight guns. In total, Captain Porter had just over 200 [[United States Navy]] officers and sailors, accompanied by a small detachment of no more than twenty [[United States Marine Corps|marines]] under the command of [[Lieutenant]] [[John M. Gamble]]. One of the sailors was the young [[midshipman]] [[David Farragut]], later the first United States Navy [[admiral]]. (Porter's son [[David Dixon Porter]] was the second U.S. Navy admiral.) Additionally, many of the prisoners from the prize enemy ships were Americans and they volunteered for service; some of the British captives too volunteered.<ref name=\"HistoryNet\" />\n\n==Campaign==\n===Founding of Madisonville===\nPorter arrived off Nuku Hiva, on October 25, 1813 and he renamed it Madison's Island after United States President [[James Madison]]. Then Porter began making preparations to establish the first American naval base in the Pacific, as well as a small [[colony]], named [[Madisonville, Nuku Hiva|Madisonville]], to house the sailors. The small [[Fort Madison, Nuku Hiva|Fort Madison]], of four guns, was also constructed on a hill next to [[Massachusetts Bay, Nuku Hiva|Massachusetts Bay]] where an official flag raising ceremony took place on November 19, a seventeen gun salute was fired and some sort of message was buried in the ground for future Europeans to find, should they attempt to colonize the island after Porter and his men left. The declaration stated that the Te I'is were subjects of the United States and that the latter had officially laid claim to the island which Porter hoped would become an important naval base. In this time the sailors also scraped the [[copper sheathing|copper bottom]] hull of ''Essex'' and used smoke to drive out over 1,000 rats hiding in her works. The Americans described the native warriors as being tall and copper colored, with tattoos over their entire bodies. They wore loin cloths and some had capes made of tree bark; the warriors also carried large clubs or spears. The women were clothed in similar fashion to the men, and friendly to the sailors. A half-naked Englishman named Wilson was found to be living on the island, and had been for many years. He served as interpreter between the Americans and the native [[tribal chief|chiefs]].<ref>Boot, pp. 31-34</ref>\n\n===Downes Expedition===\n[[File:Nuku Hiva warrior 1813.jpg|150px|left|thumb|''A warrior of Nuku Hiva'' by [[Wilhelm Gottlieb Tilesius von Tilenau]], 1813]]\nNuku Hiva, at the time, was inhabited by many tribes of indigenous peoples, separated in villages by mountain peaks thousands of feet high. The area of land around Massachusetts Bay, which became the town of Madisonville, was controlled by Chief Gattanewa of the Te I'i and in return for rights to build the base, Gattanewa demanded that the Americans become his allies and help fight the war against the Happah. While the majority of the Americans were still building their settlement, [[Lieutenant]] [[John Downes (naval officer)|John Downes]], Marine Lieutenant John Gamble and a platoon of forty Marines, were ordered to proceed to an in-land [[redoubt]], located high in the mountains. The main effort of this expedition dragged along a wheeled 6 pound cannon for added effect. The amazement of the aboriginals at gunpowder weapons had already been noted upon their landing on the island. Several hundred Te I'i warriors accompanied the expedition which left the coast in the first week of November. After a journey through the jungle Downes and his men found the fort occupied by 3,000 to 4,000 hostiles. The Te I'i and their American allies attacked; during the fighting a rock hit Downes in the stomach, hurting him. A sailor was wounded by a spear to the neck, but he apparently survived. Lt. Gamble was singled out by a heavily built Happah warrior, who charged at him with a wooden club. Drawing his Mameluke sword Gamble blocked the club from knocking him unconscious as another Marine, seeing Gamble struggling, leveled his musket at the Happah's head. The shot, fired from only a foot away, nearly decapitated the warrior.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\nThe assault on the fort was successful and Downes reported that his men had killed five enemies and that the Te I'i massacred the wounded with clubs. Lieutenant Downes also said that he was very surprised that his allies did not eat the dead; instead they used their bones to make necklaces and fan handles. Over the next few days the chiefs of the Happah arrived at the coast to settle a peace agreement. One of the stipulations required the Happah to fight alongside the Te I'i and Americans in another operation against the Tai Pi.<ref>Boot, pp. 34-35</ref>\n\n===Porter expedition===\nNot long after subduing the Happah, the Tai Pi declared war on the Te I'i, the Happah, and the Americans. Thus followed one of the most significant amphibious landings in the history of American operations in the Pacific during the 1800s. It was unopposed but Captain Porter's fleet, combined with around 5,000 friendly warriors, in at least 200 [[canoe|war-canoe]]s, attacked the Tai Pi-held coastline. After that, thirty-six officers and men with a cannon, personally commanded by Porter, led the expedition to a fortress with seven-foot-high walls. A battle began when the Tai Pis ambushed the column in the jungle near the fort. Porter wrote \"''We entered the bushes, and at every instant assailed by spears and stones, which came from different parties in the ambuscade. We could hear the snapping of the slings, the whistling of the stones, and the spears came quivering by us, but we could not percieve [sic] from whom they came.''\" Skirmishing broke out and the expedition continued forward, encountering heavier resistance the farther they went. The column eventually made it to the fort where a pitched battle began that would last for hours. The Te I'is and Happahs provided the brunt of the attack while the Americans picked off enemy warriors with their muskets; the cannon was aimed at the fortifications. Upon arrival, a Marine sergeant notified Lt. Gamble and Capt. Porter of the hopelessness of their situation. The Marines in his squad were down to three or four cartridges of ammunition. Lt. Gamble and four men were given permission to run back to the beach for a resupply but upon their arrival the situation with their natives allies had deteriorated.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\nThousands of Tai Pis occupied the heavily defended position and they managed to repel the native attacks. Near the end of the engagement, the Te I'is and Happahs fled, leaving the thirty-six Americans to fend for themselves. Capt. Porter notified Lt. Gamble to order his Marines to cover the retreat back to the beach. Gamble positioned his men at the edge of a bush for one last decisive volley to ensure a strong enemy force did not pursue them. The American force lost one man killed and two wounded. One of the casualties was Lieutenant Downes, who suffered a badly broken leg. \"''We returned to the beach much fatigued and harassed with marching and fighting,''\" said Porter, who then sailed back to Madisonville.<ref>Boot, pp. 35\u201336</ref>\n\n===Battle of Typee Valley===\n[[File:Atlas pittoresque pl 054.jpg|right|thumb|200px|''An 1846 lithograph of Nuka Hiva.'']]\nOnce word spread that Porter and his allies had been defeated, the Te I'i and the Happah warriors began to turn on the Americans which led them to fear that Madisonville would be overrun and the inhabitants massacred. Porter wrote; \"''I had now no alternative, but to prove our superiority by a successful attack upon the Typees.''\" Porter organized and led most of his men on a second mission into enemy territory, this time overland to [[Typee Valley]] and with limited assistance from the Te I'i. The valley is a dense nine miles across by three miles and was the heartland of the Tai Pi where their villages were located and where they harvested [[coconut]] and [[breadfruit]]. By making a detour to avoid the heavily defended fort near the coast, Porter could make a surprise attack and use terrain and his superior weapons to their advantage. During one night the column marched to the top of a ridge overlooking the valley but because the Americans were exhausted from a long march, Porter decided to wait until the next morning to attack. The following day was rainy and windy according to reports, moisture had temporarily ruined the gunpowder, so the expedition spent another day resting and waiting for the powder to dry. Finally on November 30, the expedition launched their attack and soon after the Americans and Te I'is found themselves in another ambush which they fought off. After that Captain Porter sent the Tai Pi leaders a message advising them to cease hostilities at once or else their villages would be burned. The captain waited for some time and when it became apparent that the message had been ignored, the advance was continued. American forces and the Te I'is eventually won the day when night came and the enemy disengaged. There were no American casualties<ref>Boot, pp. 36-37</ref>\n\nPorter claimed he took no pleasure in conquering a \"''happy and heroic people''\" and he described the aftermath of the battle as \"''a scene of desolation and horror''\". The captain also wrote that he left behind a \"''line of smoking ruins''\" when he started the return march to Madisonville. Tai Pi emissaries were not far behind and they brought the Americans \"''countless''\" [[hog (swine)|hog]]s as a peace offering. A British magazine later said that Porter was guilty of <blockquote> \"''wantonly murdering unoffending savages''\" to which the captain replied; \"''Many may censure my conduct as wanton and unjust.... But let such reflect on our peculiar situation--a handful of men residing among numerous war-like tribes, liable every moment to be attacked by them and all cut off; our only hopes on safety was in convincing them of our great superiority over them and from what we have already seen, we must either attack them or be attacked.... Wars are not always just, and are rarely free from excesses--my conscience acquits me of any injustice, and no excesses were committed but what the Typees had in their power to stop by ceasing hostilities.''\"<ref name=autogenerated1>Boot, p. 37</ref></blockquote>\n\n===''Seringapatam'' Mutiny===\nBy 9 December 1813, USS ''Essex'' was repaired and ready for sailing. The sailors were not happy about leaving their Marquesan girlfriends and Porter had to suppress one [[mutiny]] by declaring that he \"''would at once put a match to the magazine, and blow them all to eternity.''\" A former Royal Navy sailor by the name of Robert White, was brought before Porter, having been accused of mutinous talk about ''Essex Junior''. White denied the accusations, now confirmed by other sailors, infuriating Porter. Porter thus drew his sword, face turning red, and yelled: \"Run you scoundrel! Run for your life!\" White ran off, jumped overboard, and swam to a nearby canoe.<ref>''Gamble of the Marines'', Raymond J Toner USN</ref>\n\nThe remaining 250 crew members remained loyal and ''Essex'' made sail on 9 December 1813 to continue raiding. Most of the fleet left, though ''Sir Andrew Hammond'', ''Seringapatam'', and ''Greenwich'' remained at Nuku Hiva with Lieutenant John Gamble, two midshipmen, nineteen sailors and six prisoners, with the prisoners and some of the sailors being British nationals.\n\nThe situation was quiet until on 7 May 1814, the British sailors among the [[garrison]] mutinied. First they released the six prisoners and then attacked Fort Madison before taking over ''Seringapatam'' and getting away. Gamble was wounded in the foot and he was left adrift in a small boat with four others but they eventually made it to ''Sir Andrew Hammond''. Meanwhile the British interpreter Wilson was arousing trouble with the Te I'i by telling them that Porter would not come back. A few days later on 9 May, six of the American sailors were attacked on the beach by the Te I'i; a sixteen-year-old midshipman was killed along with four sailors while two others escaped, one of whom was wounded. Meanwhile, Gamble was alone on his ship, recovering from his wounded foot, when two war-canoes approached for an attack. The cannon of the ship were pre-loaded so single handedly Gamble limped from gun to gun, firing them as fast as possible, until the enemy fell back. On the next morning he gave the order to evacuate Madisonville, there being only eight men left on shore and all were either wounded or ill. Thus ended the existence of America's first naval base and colony in the Pacific Ocean. Captain Porter never returned to the island due to his capture by the British at the [[Battle of Valpara\u00edso]] on March 28, 1814.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\n==Post-script==\nThe mutineers sailed ''Seringapatam'' to [[New South Wales]].

He was mentored by Ann Prewitt and created puzzles, including the whale mask, and other interactive projects for the hands-on children's space.

He was particularly interested in visiting Buddhist temples and gardens in [[Kyoto]] and [[Nara, Nara|Nara]]. During his final trip to Japan shortly after his diagnosis, Doncourt visited Sanj\u016bsangen-d\u014d, a Buddhist temple of the Tendai sect in the Higashiyama district of Kyoto, several times. He produced a detailed drawing in the Hall of the Lotus King, where1,001 statues and their guardians stand. That drawing became the basis for his final painting, a large canvas portraying multiple rows of golden Kannon with a guardian statue in the foreground. The specific guardian Doncourt chose to focus on is named Sakara Ryu-o (literally the Sakara King of Dragons). He relied on memory alone to recreate the colors.  In September 2019, a kindred spirit, Lisa Schell, and her friend, an editor from the ''Kyoto Visitor\u2019s Guide'', expressed interest in using Doncourt\u2019s painting for the cover of an upcoming issue, with an accompanying article about 'the immortal force of compassion and mercy' that inspired him at Sanj\u016bsangen-d\u014d.

His lifelong friend, Chuck Bernklau, contributed the magical photographic images on the back covers of ''House in the Woods'' and ''Lantern.''  Renowned artist Peter Zokosky painted the cover of ''The Mortal Coil'' album (2014). His girlfriend at the time, Lisa Schell, painted the cover for ''Stained Glass Stories'' (1978). \n\n=== American Museum of Natural History (1992 \u2013 2016) === \nIn 1992, Doncourt became an Education Department volunteer in the early days of the ''Discovery Room'' at AMNH. He was mentored by Ann Prewitt and created puzzles, including the whale mask, and other interactive projects for the hands-on children's space. After that, he was hired to build models for the ''Structures & Culture Moveable Museum,'' and was subsequently offered a position with the Exhibition Department. He helped renovate the ''Hall of Ocean Life'' and built some exhibits for it.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.boxdioramas.com/american-museum-of-natural-history|title=American Museum of Natural History|website=Box Dioramas.com|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-15}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/learning/students/pop/20030204snaptuesday.html|title=Rescuing the Diorama From the Fate of the Dodo|website=archive.nytimes.com|access-date=2020-02-15}}</ref> Doncourt was also part of the team that built the 28-foot-long [[Quetzalcoatlus]] for the show ''Pterosaurs: Flight in the Age of Dinosaurs'' in 2014.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Stapinski|first=Helene|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/01/science/behind-the-scenes-at-pterosaurs-flight-in-the-age-of-dinosaurs.html|title=Fleshing Out the Bones|date=2014-03-31|work=The New York Times|access-date=2020-02-15|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> He was a Preparator, or Exhibitions Artist until he retired as Senior Principal Preparator in 2016.<ref name=\":1\" /> \n\nWhile with the AMNH, Doncourt also worked on [[diorama]]<nowiki/>s. He taught the public course ''The Art of the Diorama'', where students learned how a museum diorama is created and how diorama and wildlife arts are instrumental to wildlife conservation.<ref name=\":5\" /> He continued teaching this course until shortly before his death in March 2019.\n\nAnother aspect of Doncourt\u2019s work at AMNH, starting in 2002, was the traveling show program. He became part of a team that was sent to various locations to set up shows that he had worked on. He also served as a consultant with other museums on diorama restoration, as in 2018, when he helped restore the ''Hall of Fishes'' in the [[Vanderbilt Museum]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://tbrnewsmedia.com/tag/thomas-doncourt/|title=Thomas Doncourt {{!}} TBR News Media|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-15}}</ref>\n\n== Cover Art for the ''Kyoto Visitor\u2019s Guide''== \nBetween the years 2000 and 2017, Doncourt traveled to Japan four times. He was particularly interested in visiting Buddhist temples and gardens in [[Kyoto]] and [[Nara, Nara|Nara]]. During his final trip to Japan shortly after his diagnosis, Doncourt visited Sanj\u016bsangen-d\u014d, a Buddhist temple of the Tendai sect in the Higashiyama district of Kyoto, several times. He produced a detailed drawing in the Hall of the Lotus King, where1,001 statues and their guardians stand. That drawing became the basis for his final painting, a large canvas portraying multiple rows of golden Kannon with a guardian statue in the foreground. The specific guardian Doncourt chose to focus on is named Sakara Ryu-o (literally the Sakara King of Dragons). He relied on memory alone to recreate the colors.  In September 2019, a kindred spirit, Lisa Schell, and her friend, an editor from the ''Kyoto Visitor\u2019s Guide'', expressed interest in using Doncourt\u2019s painting for the cover of an upcoming issue, with an accompanying article about 'the immortal force of compassion and mercy' that inspired him at Sanj\u016bsangen-d\u014d. The magazine offered Doncourt's estate an opportunity to showcase his artwork, and his lyrics about the nearby Philosopher\u2019s Path.<ref name=\":2\" /> The issue was published in February 2020.  \n \n== Discography == \n* 1978: Cathedral - ''Stained Glass Stories'', Delta Records<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/de/artist/1441714-Cathedral-3|title=Cathedral (3)|website=Discogs|language=de|access-date=2020-02-15}}</ref>\n* 2002: Thomas Doncourt - ''Fauve,'' self released<ref>{{Citation|title=Fauve by Thomas Doncourt|url=https://rateyourmusic.com/release/album/thomas_doncourt/fauve/|access-date=2020-02-15}}</ref>\n* 2007: Cathedral - ''The Bridge'', self released<ref name=\":8\" /> \n* 2009: FauveMuseum - ''Blacklight,'' self released<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/FauveMuseum-Blacklight/release/5544720|title=FauveMuseum - Blacklight|website=Discogs|language=en|access-date=2020-02-15}}</ref>\n* 2014: Tom Doncourt - ''The Mortal Coil,'' self released<ref name=\":6\" /> \n* 2015: Tom Doncourt - ''The Moon Will Rise,'' self released<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/de/artist/1441713-Tom-Doncourt|title=Tom Doncourt|website=Discogs|language=de|access-date=2020-02-15}}</ref>\n* 2017: Tom Doncourt - ''House in the Woods,'' self released<ref name=\":7\" /> \n* 2018: Tom Doncourt & Nadia Ratsimandresy - ''Ratsimandresy & Doncourt, Volume 1'', self released<ref>{{Citation|title=\u266b Ratsimandresy & Doncourt, Vol. 1 - Tom Doncourt.
