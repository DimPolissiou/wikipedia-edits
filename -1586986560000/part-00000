The country continued to be widely considered a [[superpower]] until the [[Suez crisis]] of 1956, and this embarrassing incident coupled with the loss of the [[British Empire|empire]] left the UK's dominant role in global affairs to be gradually diminished.

The UK had been a member state of the [[European Union]] (and a member of its predecessors) since 1973.  However, due to the outcome of a 2016 [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|membership referendum]], proceedings to withdraw from the EU [[United Kingdom invocation of Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union|began in 2017]] and concluded when the UK formally left the EU on 31 January 2020.

British foreign policy initially focused on achieving a [[Balance of power (international relations)|balance of power]] within Europe, with no one country achieving dominance over the affairs of the continent. This was a major reason behind the British wars against Napoleon, and the UK's involvement in the First and Second World Wars.\n\nThe chief enemy of the British, from the [[Hundred Years' War]] until the defeat of [[Napoleon]] (1337-1815) was [[History of France|France]], a larger country with a more powerful army. The British were generally [[British military history|successful in their many wars]], with the notable exception of the [[American War of Independence]] (1775\u20131783), when Britain, without any major allies, was defeated by the colonials who had the support of France, the Netherlands and Spain. A favoured diplomatic strategy was subsidising the armies of continental allies, such as [[Prussia]], thereby turning London's enormous financial power to military advantage. Britain relied heavily on its [[History of the Royal Navy|Royal Navy]] for security, seeking to keep it the most powerful fleet afloat with a full complement of bases across the globe. British dominance of the seas was vital to the formation of the British Empire, which was achieved through the maintenance of a Navy larger than the next two largest Navies combined for the majority of the 19th and early 20th centuries, prior to the entry of the United States into the Second World War.\n\n===1814\u20131914===\n{{Main|History of the foreign relations of the United Kingdom#1814-1914}}\n{{Further|International relations of the Great Powers (1814\u20131919)}}\n[[File:Arthur Mees Flags of A Free Empire 1910 Cornell CUL PJM 1167 01.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Map of the [[British Empire]] (as of 1910).

Britain supported the American solution through the [[Dawes Plan]]  and the [[Young Plan]], whereby Germany paid its reparations using money borrowed from New York banks.<ref>Patrick O. Cohrs, ''The unfinished peace after world war 1: America, Britain and the stabilization of Europe, 1919-1932'' (2006).</ref> The [[Great Depression]] starting in 1929 put enormous pressure on the British economy. Britain move toward imperial preference, which meant low tariffs among the Commonwealth of Nations, and higher barriers toward trade with outside countries.  The flow of money from New York dried up, and the system of reparations and payment of debt died in 1931.\n\nIn domestic British politics, the emerging Labour Party had a distinctive and suspicious foreign policy based on pacifism. Its leaders believed that peace was impossible because of capitalism, secret diplomacy, and the trade in armaments. That is it stressed material factors that ignored the psychological memories of the Great War, and the highly emotional tensions regarding nationalism and the boundaries of the countries.  Nevertheless, party leader [[Ramsay MacDonald]] spent much of his attention on European policies.<ref>Henry R.

The League of Nations proved disappointing to its supporters; it was unable to resolve any of the threats posed by the dictators.

The cumulative costs of fighting two world wars, however, placed a heavy burden upon the UK economy, and after 1945 the British Empire gradually began to disintegrate, with many territories granted independence. By the mid-to-late 1950s, the UK's status as a superpower had been largely diminished by the rise of the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]]. Many former colonial territories joined the \"Commonwealth of Nations,\" an organisation of fully independent nations now with equal status to the UK.<ref>Lawrence James, ''The Rise and Fall of the British Empire'' (2001)</ref>  Britain finally turned its attention to the continent, joining the European Union.<ref>Stephen Wall, ''A Stranger in Europe: Britain and the EU from Thatcher to Blair'' (2008)</ref>\n\nPractically all the colonies became independent. Britain reduced its involvements in the Middle east, with the humiliating [[Suez Crisis]] of 1956 marking the end of its status as a superpower. However Britain did forge close military ties with the United States, France, and traditional foes such as Germany, in the [[NATO]] military alliance.

In 1949 the Irish Houses of Parliament passed the Republic of Ireland Act, making the Republic of Ireland officially fully independent; the country withdrew from the Commonwealth. Under the [[Ireland Act 1949]] Irish citizens are treated as though they are Commonwealth citizens and not aliens for the purposes of law.

The long-standing relationship formally began in 1901 when the six British [[Crown colonies]] in Australia federated, and the Commonwealth of Australia was formed as a [[Dominion]] of the [[British Empire]]. Australia fought alongside Britain in World War I, notably at [[Gallipoli]], and again in World War II.  [[Andrew Fisher]], Australian prime minister from 1914 to 1916, declared that Australia would defend the United Kingdom \"to the last man and the last shilling.\" Until 1949, the United Kingdom and Australia shared a common [[nationality law|nationality code]].  The final constitutional ties between United Kingdom and Australia ended in 1986 with the passing of the [[Australia Act 1986]]. Currently, more than 4% of the Australian population was born in the UK, giving strong mutual relations.

The country continued to be widely considered a [[superpower]] until the [[Suez crisis]] of 1956, and this embarrassing incident coupled with the loss of the [[British Empire|empire]] left the UK's dominant role in global affairs to be gradually diminished. Nevertheless, the United Kingdom remains a [[great power]] and a [[United Nations Security Council#Permanent members|permanent member]] of the [[United Nations Security Council]], a founding member of the [[G7]], [[G8]], [[G-20 major economies|G20]], [[NATO]], [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]], [[World Trade Organization|WTO]], [[Council of Europe]], [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|OSCE]], and the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], which is a legacy of the British Empire. The UK had been a member state of the [[European Union]] (and a member of its predecessors) since 1973.  However, due to the outcome of a 2016 [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|membership referendum]], proceedings to withdraw from the EU [[United Kingdom invocation of Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union|began in 2017]] and concluded when the UK formally left the EU on 31 January 2020.

British foreign policy initially focused on achieving a [[Balance of power (international relations)|balance of power]] within Europe, with no one country achieving dominance over the affairs of the continent. This was a major reason behind the British wars against Napoleon, and the UK's involvement in the First and Second World Wars.\n\nThe chief enemy of the British, from the [[Hundred Years' War]] until the defeat of [[Napoleon]] (1337-1815) was [[History of France|France]], a larger country with a more powerful army. The British were generally [[British military history|successful in their many wars]], with the notable exception of the [[American War of Independence]] (1775\u20131783), when Britain, without any major allies, was defeated by the colonials who had the support of France, the Netherlands and Spain. A favoured diplomatic strategy was subsidising the armies of continental allies, such as [[Prussia]], thereby turning London's enormous financial power to military advantage. Britain relied heavily on its [[History of the Royal Navy|Royal Navy]] for security, seeking to keep it the most powerful fleet afloat with a full complement of bases across the globe. British dominance of the seas was vital to the formation of the British Empire, which was achieved through the maintenance of a Navy larger than the next two largest Navies combined for the majority of the 19th and early 20th centuries, prior to the entry of the United States into the Second World War.\n\n===1814\u20131914===\n{{Main|History of the foreign relations of the United Kingdom#1814-1914}}\n{{Further|International relations of the Great Powers (1814\u20131919)}}\n[[File:Arthur Mees Flags of A Free Empire 1910 Cornell CUL PJM 1167 01.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Map of the [[British Empire]] (as of 1910).

By 1933 disarmament had collapsed and the issue became rearming for a war against Germany.<ref>Raymond G.

Britain supported the American solution through the [[Dawes Plan]]  and the [[Young Plan]], whereby Germany paid its reparations using money borrowed from New York banks.<ref>Patrick O. Cohrs, ''The unfinished peace after world war 1: America, Britain and the stabilization of Europe, 1919-1932'' (2006).</ref> The [[Great Depression]] starting in 1929 put enormous pressure on the British economy. Britain move toward imperial preference, which meant low tariffs among the Commonwealth of Nations, and higher barriers toward trade with outside countries.  The flow of money from New York dried up, and the system of reparations and payment of debt died in 1931.\n\nIn domestic British politics, the emerging Labour Party had a distinctive and suspicious foreign policy based on pacifism. Its leaders believed that peace was impossible because of capitalism, secret diplomacy, and the trade in armaments. That is it stressed material factors that ignored the psychological memories of the Great War, and the highly emotional tensions regarding nationalism and the boundaries of the countries.  Nevertheless, party leader [[Ramsay MacDonald]] spent much of his attention on European policies.<ref>Henry R.

The League of Nations proved disappointing to its supporters; it was unable to resolve any of the threats posed by the dictators.  British policy was to \"appease\" them in the hopes they would be satiated. By 1938 it was clear that war was looming, and that Germany had the world's most powerful military. The final act of appeasement came when Britain and France sacrificed [[Czechoslovakia]] to Hitler's demands at the [[Munich Agreement]] of 1938.<ref>[[David Faber (politician)|David Faber]], ''Munich, 1938: Appeasement and World War II'' (2010)</ref> Instead of satiation Hitler menaced Poland, and at last Prime Minister [[Neville Chamberlain]] dropped appeasement and stood firm in promising to defend Poland.

The cumulative costs of fighting two world wars, however, placed a heavy burden upon the UK economy, and after 1945 the British Empire gradually began to disintegrate, with many territories granted independence. By the mid-to-late 1950s, the UK's status as a superpower had been largely diminished by the rise of the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]]. Many former colonial territories joined the \"Commonwealth of Nations,\" an organisation of fully independent nations now with equal status to the UK.<ref>Lawrence James, ''The Rise and Fall of the British Empire'' (2001)</ref>  Britain finally turned its attention to the continent, joining the European Union.<ref>Stephen Wall, ''A Stranger in Europe: Britain and the EU from Thatcher to Blair'' (2008)</ref>\n\nPractically all the colonies became independent. Britain reduced its involvements in the Middle east, with the humiliating [[Suez Crisis]] of 1956 marking the end of its status as a superpower. However Britain did forge close military ties with the United States, France, and traditional foes such as Germany, in the [[NATO]] military alliance. After years of debate (and rebuffs), Britain joined the [[European Economic Community|Common Market]] in 1973; it is now the [[History of the European Union|European Union]].<ref>Andrew Marr, ''A History of Modern Britain'' (2009)</ref> However it did not merge financially, and kept the pound separate from the Euro, which kept it partly isolated from the EU [[European sovereign debt crisis|financial crisis of 2011]].<ref>Stephen Wall, ''A Stranger in Europe: Britain and the EU from Thatcher to Blair'' (Oxford University Press, 2008)</ref> As of 23 June 2016, the UK has voted to leave the EU.<ref>Andrew Gamble,  \"Better Off Out?

In 1949 the Irish Houses of Parliament passed the Republic of Ireland Act, making the Republic of Ireland officially fully independent; the country withdrew from the Commonwealth. Under the [[Ireland Act 1949]] Irish citizens are treated as though they are Commonwealth citizens and not aliens for the purposes of law. Until 1998, the Republic of Ireland claimed Northern Ireland, but this was rescinded under the [[Belfast Agreement]] through an amendment of the Irish Constitution, which now states an aspiration to peaceful unity.

The long-standing relationship formally began in 1901 when the six British [[Crown colonies]] in Australia federated, and the Commonwealth of Australia was formed as a [[Dominion]] of the [[British Empire]]. Australia fought alongside Britain in World War I, notably at [[Gallipoli]], and again in World War II.  [[Andrew Fisher]], Australian prime minister from 1914 to 1916, declared that Australia would defend the United Kingdom \"to the last man and the last shilling.\" Until 1949, the United Kingdom and Australia shared a common [[nationality law|nationality code]].  The final constitutional ties between United Kingdom and Australia ended in 1986 with the passing of the [[Australia Act 1986]]. Currently, more than 4% of the Australian population was born in the UK, giving strong mutual relations.

Released worldwide on December 1, 2017, it is the third installment in the ''[[Xenoblade Chronicles]]'' series, and the seventh main entry in the ''[[Xeno (series)|Xeno]]'' meta series; although it features a different setting and characters than the first ''[[Xenoblade Chronicles (video game)|Xenoblade Chronicles]]'', it marks a return to a story-driven game, unlike the previous game in the series, ''[[Xenoblade Chronicles X]]'', which was oriented towards [[open world]] exploration.\n\n''Xenoblade Chronicles 2'' takes place in Alrest, a world covered in a sea of clouds. Humans live on top of and inside living creatures known as Titans, together with Blades, powerful beings that can be summoned by certain humans named Drivers, and to whom they are tied for the rest of the Driver's life. After he is hired for a salvaging mission, a young Driver named Rex is killed, but revived by a legendary Blade named Pyra on the promise of taking her to Elysium, a fabled paradise at the top of the World Tree. Together with other Drivers and Blades, the duo, caught in a war between countries, attempts to reach the World Tree, while being chased by Torna, an elusive faction seeking to capture Pyra.\n\nDevelopment of ''Xenoblade Chronicles 2'' began shortly before the launch of ''Xenoblade Chronicles X''. Several key people from previous ''Xenoblade Chronicles'' games returned including franchise creator, executive director and co-writer [[Tetsuya Takahashi]] and directors Koh Kojima and Genki Yokota. Using their experience from ''X'', the team wanted to develop a story-driven game in the style of the original ''Xenoblade Chronicles''. The soundtrack was composed and arranged by [[Yasunori Mitsuda]], ACE, Kenji Hiramatsu, and Manami Kiyota. The main characters were drawn by Masatsugu Saito, best known for his work in ''[[Expelled from Paradise]]'', while [[Tetsuya Nomura]] designed the characters of Torna; many guest artists were hired to design the Blades unrelated to the main story. Gameplay-wise, ''Xenoblade Chronicles 2'' is similar to previous entries, with the notable addition of the Blades, three of whom the player can switch between during a battle; most Blades in the game are optional, and must be \"awakened\" from a Core Crystal, resulting in a randomly selected Blade becoming tied to a specific Driver, who can use them in combat.\n\nThe game was first announced alongside the [[Nintendo Switch]] reveal presentation in 2017, with a worldwide release date planned for the same year. Similarly to the original ''Xenoblade Chronicles'', the game's localization was handled by Nintendo of Europe. Unlike the controversy surrounding ''Xenoblade Chronicles X'', the game does not feature any sort of censorship between different versions. Upon release the game received generally positive reviews, with most praise going to its story, combat, music, environments, and amount of content. At over 1.7 million copies sold as of June 2019, it is the best-selling title in the ''Xeno'' series, and Monolith Soft's most commercially successful game. A large story-based [[downloadable content]] (DLC) addition taking place 500 years before the main game and featuring its own game mechanics, titled ''[[Xenoblade Chronicles 2: Torna \u2013 The Golden Country]]'', was released in September 2018.\n\n== Gameplay ==\nAkin to previous ''Xenoblade'' games, ''Xenoblade Chronicles 2'' is an [[action role-playing game]] (ARPG) where the player controls a main character out of a [[Party (role-playing games)|party]] of three.<ref name=\"Euro1\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2017/01/12/xenoblade-chronicles-2-is-first-japanese-role-playing-game-for-the-nintendo-switch/|title=Xenoblade Chronicles 2 is the first big Japanese role-playing game for the Nintendo Switch |work=[[VentureBeat]]|first=Dean|last=Takahashi|date=January 12, 2017|accessdate=January 14, 2017|url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170118070628/http://venturebeat.com/2017/01/12/xenoblade-chronicles-2-is-first-japanese-role-playing-game-for-the-nintendo-switch/ |archivedate=January 18, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"GI XBC2 p.2\">{{cite web|last=Wallace|first=Kimberley|title=Xenoblade Chronicles 2: Big World, Big Battles, Big Changes|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/games/xenoblade_chronicles_2/b/switch/archive/2017/11/07/xenoblade-chronicles-2-hands-on-feature.aspx?PostPageIndex=2|website=[[Game Informer]]|date=November 7, 2017|accessdate=December 14, 2017|page=2}}</ref> The game employs an [[open world]] design, with a day-and-night time cycle that often affects in-game events, including quests, enemy strength, and [[Item (gaming)|item]] availability. Unlike previous entries ''Xenoblade Chronicles'' & ''Xenoblade Chronicles X'', which consisted of a cohesive open world through which player could journey uninterrupted, the game takes place on several Titans, between whom the player travels via a Fast Travel option.\n\nThe biggest change to gameplay mechanics comes from Blades, sentient beings summoned from \"Core Crystals\" who provide their summoners - called Drivers - weapons in combat and make up the player's party (separate from the character party). Each character can only have three Blades active at a time. The Blade equipped on a Driver determines their class, and Blade weapon types are divided into three main categories: Attacker, Healer, and Tank. Blades support their Driver in the form of buffs and special attacks performed by both a Driver and their Blade. Buffs and other upgrades can be unlocked through a Blade's Affinity Chart. A Blade is tied to their Driver, and cannot usually be used by another; however, a rare item called the Overdrive Protocol allows the player to change a Blade's affiliated Driver.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.rpgsite.net/feature/6433-xenoblade-chronicles-2-blades-guide-unlocking-new-blades-upgrading-blades-overdrive-protocol-and-the-best-blades-explained | title=Xenoblade Chronicles 2 Blades Guide: unlocking new blades, upgrading blades, overdrive protocol and the best blades explained | work=RPGSite | first= | last= | date=December 16, 2017 | accessdate=February 23, 2018}}</ref> \n\nThere are a total of 40 distinctly unique \"rare\" blades to collect throughout the base game with an additional 11 being obtainable either through DLC packs or New Game Plus in later patches. Each Driver has a Blade automatically assigned to them when they join the party, who are also a part of the game's story. Most of the game's Blades are not a part of the main story, and can be assigned to any Driver; among those is [[KOS-MOS]] from the ''Xeno'' sub-series ''[[Xenosaga]]''.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://gematsu.com/2017/11/xenoblade-chronicles-2-adds-kos-mos-re-xenosaga-rare-blade | title=Xenoblade Chronicles 2 adds KOS-MOS Re: from Xenosaga as Rare Blade | work=Gematsu| first=Sal | last=Romano | date=November 30, 2017 | accessdate=February 21, 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Synopsis ==\n=== Setting ===\nThe game is set in Alrest, which has no continental landmasses, but instead is made of a sea topped with clouds, called the \"Cloud Sea\" and inhabited by massive creatures known as titans on which smaller creatures reside. Legends claim humanity once lived atop the World Tree in a paradise called Elysium with their creator, the Architect, but they were exiled for unknown reasons and given the Titans to live on. Blades are powerful beings summoned from \"Core Crystals\" who channel power into their weapons through a force called ether. Their masters are called Drivers; when a Driver dies, their Blade reverts to a Core Crystal and loses their memory. After some time, another Driver can awaken them so long as the crystal is intact. At the game's start, the nation-states of Mor Ardain and Uraya are on the brink of war.\n\n=== Plot ===\nRex, an orphaned salvager who collects treasure from below the Cloud Sea for money, is hired by Argentum Trade Guild Chairman Bana to aid the Drivers Jin, Malos, and Nia, part of a group named Torna, in the salvage of an ancient ship. In the ship, they find Pyra, a legendary Blade known as an Aegis. When Rex reaches out to touch Pyra's sword, Jin fatally stabs him. Rex awakens on a field with Pyra, who reveals they are in a memory of her old home Elysium. She asks him to bring her to Elysium and in exchange gives him half of her Core Crystal to revive him. With help from his Titan companion Gramps and Nia, who has defected from Torna, Rex escapes to the Titan Gormott, but Gramps is wounded and reverts to his larval stage. Soon after, they arrive in Gormott's capital Torigoth and are joined by the Nopon Driver Tora and his artificial Blade Poppi. The group try to get to the World Tree, but are stopped by the Artifice Ophion and swallowed by the Titan Uraya.\n\nAfter the group battles the mercenary Driver Vandham while escaping Uraya's stomach, he joins the party and Rex begins to look to him as a mentor. The group later learns that Jin and Malos are the leaders of Torna, a terrorist group named after a Titan destroyed in the Aegis War 500 years ago. Led by Jin, who is revealed to have fought against Malos 500 years ago, and Malos, later revealed as an Aegis, they seek to destroy humanity by unleashing the Artifice Aion on the World Tree and killing the Architect. During a battle with Malos and fellow Torna member; Akhos, Vandham is killed and Pyra unveils her true form Mythra. They have shared memory and consider themselves sisters, switching back and forth as needed.\n\nThe group's search for a way past Ophion leads them to join forces with M\u00f3rag, the Ardainian emperor Niall's elder sister; and Zeke, prince of Tantal on the Titan Genbu. Malos's Driver Amalthus later summons the party to Indol, which controls Core Crystal distribution. After Amalthus attempts peace talks between Uraya and Mor Ardain, the group stops Bana's attempt to kill Niall.\n\nLater on, in Tantal, the group battles Jin, who forces Pyra to surrender. While Gramps leads the group to the third Aegis sword to save Pyra, Malos siphons Pyra's power to regain his full strength. After the group finds the third sword, phantoms of Addam nearly kill Rex. To save him, Nia reveals herself as a Flesh Eater (a Blade made human by devouring his Driver, which every member of Torna except Malos is), and Addam's spirit deems Rex worthy of the third sword. The group confronts Jin and Malos at the Cliffs of Morytha near the World Tree, during which Rex unlocks Pyra and Mythra's true form Pneuma. Rex, now matched with Jin's power, forces Malos to summon Ophion, who knocks the group into the abyss beneath the World Tree.\n\nIn the Land of Morytha, under the Cloud Sea, the group is forced to work with a weakened Jin. Soon after, Amalthus, revealed to be just as bent on wiping out humanity and the reason for Malos' malicious nature,  attacks the World Tree by controlling various Titans. The group severs his connection to the Titans, only for him to kill all Torna members except Malos and Jin, the later of which defeats him before dying redeemed. The group arrives in Elysium and meet the Architect, a scientist named Klaus. He explains that, long ago, he discovered a device called the Conduit that sends objects into different dimensions, the use of which split his body in two and destroyed the old world.{{efn|The Architect's other half was sent to an alternate dimension, the setting of [[Xenoblade Chronicles|the first ''Xenoblade Chronicles'']].}}\n\nSensing that his other half is about to die, which will result in his own death, Klaus sends the group to stop Malos, who has obtained Aion. After Malos's defeat and death, Klaus dies, but not before granting Rex and the party \"one final gift.\" Klaus's death causes the Conduit to shut off; without the Conduit, the World Tree begins to crumble, which will destroy Alrest. Pneuma helps the group escape, but sacrifices herself to detonate the World Tree. The group barely survives when Gramps, thanks to Pneuma, returns to his adult form and flies everyone down to Alrest. As part of Klaus's \"last gift\", the Cloud Sea fades to reveal a new world and the Titans merge to form a new landmass. Afterwards, Pyra and Mythra are revived in separate bodies and reunite with Rex.\n\n== Development ==\nThe game is the third title in [[Monolith Soft]]'s ''[[Xenoblade Chronicles]]'' series, following the original ''[[Xenoblade Chronicles (video game)|Xenoblade Chronicles]]'' and ''[[Xenoblade Chronicles X]]''.<ref name=\"GameInformerPrev1\">{{cite web|last=Wallace|first=Kimberley|title=Xenoblade Chronicles 2: Big World, Big Battles, Big Changes|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/games/xenoblade_chronicles_2/b/switch/archive/2017/11/07/xenoblade-chronicles-2-hands-on-feature.aspx?PostPageIndex=1|website=[[Game Informer]]|date=November 7, 2017|accessdate=December 14, 2017|page=1}}</ref> Plans for the game began as early as July 2014, during the latter half of development of ''Xenoblade Chronicles X'', out of the negative fan reaction from changes implemented in the title.<ref name=\"SilOrigins\">{{cite web|author=Sato|title=Xenoblade Chronicles 2 Devs Explain Why There Are So Many Female Rare Blades|url=http://www.siliconera.com/2017/11/28/xenoblade-chronicles-2-devs-talk-many-female-rare-blades-super-rare/|website=Siliconera|date=November 28, 2017|accessdate=November 28, 2017}}</ref> While the original ''Xenoblade Chronicles'' followed the typical structure of a general story-driven [[JRPG]], ''Xenoblade Chronicles X'' received far less emphasis on story, and was organized in more of a mission-based structure, focused primarily on exploring the game's massive [[open world]].<ref name=\"GameInformerPrev1\"/> The development grew impatient upon hearing the fanbase complain about the changes, and started work on another story-driven title.<ref name=\"SilOrigins\"/> Because the gameplay was more of a continuation of the first title, they decided to title it ''Xenoblade Chronicles 2''.<ref name=\"SilOrigins\"/> Initial work on the game was difficult because the [[technical specifications]] of the [[Nintendo Switch]] were not yet finalized or known yet,<ref name=\"SilOrigins\"/> but once it was finalized, the game featured a shorter development period compared to the prior titles, with executive director [[Tetsuya Takahashi]] citing being able to use the technological foundation established in ''Xenoblade Chronicles X'' as a means of speeding up development time.<ref name=\"TimeMag1\"/><ref name=\"Gem1\">{{cite web|url=https://gematsu.com/2017/01/xenoblade-chronicles-2-announced-switch |title=Xenoblade Chronicles 2 announced for Switch |work=Gematsu |first=Sal |last=Romano |date=January 12, 2017 |accessdate=January 14, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170116152646/https://gematsu.com/2017/01/xenoblade-chronicles-2-announced-switch |archivedate=January 16, 2017 }}</ref> Another motivating factor was the agreement made by the team with [[Nintendo]] specifically to deliver the game early on in the Nintendo Switch's lifecycle.<ref name=\"TimeMag1\">{{cite web|first=Matt |last=Peckham |title=Why 'Xenoblade Chronicles 2' Has a Character Designed by Tetsuya Nomura  |url=http://time.com/4848935/xenoblade-chronicles-2-interview/ |website=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=July 7, 2017 |accessdate=July 28, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nOne of Monolith Soft's objectives for the game was to give the characters a wider range of facial expressions compared to past ''Xenoblade'' titles.

Though Blades change up how you fight in ''Chronicles 2'', the game spills over with the traits that make the first ''Chronicles'' game a stand-out experience. More story, more enemies to scrap with, more landscapes to tread across. ''Chronicles 2'' is a dialogue-heavy game, but there are many points where Monolith Soft lets its environments narrate the seriousness of Alrest's plight.\" She highly praised the game's story, stating \"The narrative explores patriotism, war, environmental decline, refugees, and examines the little people who get caught in the crush when big powers scrap with one another.

He stated: \"''Xenoblade 2'' consistently displays a frustrating lack of respect for the player\u2019s time. Everything takes significantly longer than it needs to, in part because the game contains such an overwhelming number of features. It can take dozens of minutes to navigate the clunky menus, sort through all of the characters\u2019 upgrades, and manage a collection of ''[[Pok\u00e9mon]]''-like Blades.\" He was also critical of the story, calling it \"an unsubtle script that stomps all over even the most interesting story scenes\".

Released worldwide on December 1, 2017, it is the third installment in the ''[[Xenoblade Chronicles]]'' series, and the seventh main entry in the ''[[Xeno (series)|Xeno]]'' meta series; although it features a different setting and characters than the first ''[[Xenoblade Chronicles (video game)|Xenoblade Chronicles]]'', it marks a return to a story-driven game, unlike the previous game in the series, ''[[Xenoblade Chronicles X]]'', which was oriented towards [[open world]] exploration.\n\n''Xenoblade Chronicles 2'' takes place in Alrest, a world covered in a sea of clouds. Humans live on top of and inside living creatures known as Titans, together with Blades, powerful beings that can be summoned by certain humans named Drivers, and to whom they are tied for the rest of the Driver's life. After he is hired for a salvaging mission, a young Driver named Rex is killed, but revived by a legendary Blade named Pyra on the promise of taking her to Elysium, a fabled paradise at the top of the World Tree. Together with other Drivers and Blades, the duo, caught in a war between countries, attempts to reach the World Tree, while being chased by Torna, an elusive faction seeking to capture Pyra.\n\nDevelopment of ''Xenoblade Chronicles 2'' began shortly before the launch of ''Xenoblade Chronicles X''. Several key people from previous ''Xenoblade Chronicles'' games returned including franchise creator, executive director and co-writer [[Tetsuya Takahashi]] and directors Koh Kojima and Genki Yokota. Using their experience from ''X'', the team wanted to develop a story-driven game in the style of the original ''Xenoblade Chronicles''. The soundtrack was composed and arranged by [[Yasunori Mitsuda]], ACE, Kenji Hiramatsu, and Manami Kiyota. The main characters were drawn by Masatsugu Saito, best known for his work in ''[[Expelled from Paradise]]'', while [[Tetsuya Nomura]] designed the characters of Torna; many guest artists were hired to design the Blades unrelated to the main story. Gameplay-wise, ''Xenoblade Chronicles 2'' is similar to previous entries, with the notable addition of the Blades, three of whom the player can switch between during a battle; most Blades in the game are optional, and must be \"awakened\" from a Core Crystal, resulting in a randomly selected Blade becoming tied to a specific Driver, who can use them in combat.\n\nThe game was first announced alongside the [[Nintendo Switch]] reveal presentation in 2017, with a worldwide release date planned for the same year. Similarly to the original ''Xenoblade Chronicles'', the game's localization was handled by Nintendo of Europe. Unlike the controversy surrounding ''Xenoblade Chronicles X'', the game does not feature any sort of censorship between different versions. Upon release the game received generally positive reviews, with most praise going to its story, combat, music, environments, and amount of content. At over 1.7 million copies sold as of June 2019, it is the best-selling title in the ''Xeno'' series, and Monolith Soft's most commercially successful game. A large story-based [[downloadable content]] (DLC) addition taking place 500 years before the main game and featuring its own game mechanics, titled ''[[Xenoblade Chronicles 2: Torna \u2013 The Golden Country]]'', was released in September 2018.\n\n== Gameplay ==\nAkin to previous ''Xenoblade'' games, ''Xenoblade Chronicles 2'' is an [[action role-playing game]] (ARPG) where the player controls a main character out of a [[Party (role-playing games)|party]] of three.<ref name=\"Euro1\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2017/01/12/xenoblade-chronicles-2-is-first-japanese-role-playing-game-for-the-nintendo-switch/|title=Xenoblade Chronicles 2 is the first big Japanese role-playing game for the Nintendo Switch |work=[[VentureBeat]]|first=Dean|last=Takahashi|date=January 12, 2017|accessdate=January 14, 2017|url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170118070628/http://venturebeat.com/2017/01/12/xenoblade-chronicles-2-is-first-japanese-role-playing-game-for-the-nintendo-switch/ |archivedate=January 18, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"GI XBC2 p.2\">{{cite web|last=Wallace|first=Kimberley|title=Xenoblade Chronicles 2: Big World, Big Battles, Big Changes|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/games/xenoblade_chronicles_2/b/switch/archive/2017/11/07/xenoblade-chronicles-2-hands-on-feature.aspx?PostPageIndex=2|website=[[Game Informer]]|date=November 7, 2017|accessdate=December 14, 2017|page=2}}</ref> The game employs an [[open world]] design, with a day-and-night time cycle that often affects in-game events, including quests, enemy strength, and [[Item (gaming)|item]] availability. Unlike previous entries ''Xenoblade Chronicles'' & ''Xenoblade Chronicles X'', which consisted of a cohesive open world through which player could journey uninterrupted, the game takes place on several Titans, between whom the player travels via a Fast Travel option.\n\nThe biggest change to gameplay mechanics comes from Blades, sentient beings summoned from \"Core Crystals\" who provide their summoners - called Drivers - weapons in combat and make up the player's party (separate from the character party). Each character can only have three Blades active at a time. The Blade equipped on a Driver determines their class, and Blade weapon types are divided into three main categories: Attacker, Healer, and Tank. Blades support their Driver in the form of buffs and special attacks performed by both a Driver and their Blade. Buffs and other upgrades can be unlocked through a Blade's Affinity Chart. A Blade is tied to their Driver, and cannot usually be used by another; however, a rare item called the Overdrive Protocol allows the player to change a Blade's affiliated Driver.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.rpgsite.net/feature/6433-xenoblade-chronicles-2-blades-guide-unlocking-new-blades-upgrading-blades-overdrive-protocol-and-the-best-blades-explained | title=Xenoblade Chronicles 2 Blades Guide: unlocking new blades, upgrading blades, overdrive protocol and the best blades explained | work=RPGSite | first= | last= | date=December 16, 2017 | accessdate=February 23, 2018}}</ref> \n\nThere are a total of 40 distinctly unique \"rare\" blades to collect throughout the base game with an additional 11 being obtainable either through DLC packs or New Game Plus in later patches. Each Driver has a Blade automatically assigned to them when they join the party, who are also a part of the game's story. Most of the game's Blades are not a part of the main story, and can be assigned to any Driver; among those is [[KOS-MOS]] from the ''Xeno'' sub-series ''[[Xenosaga]]''.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://gematsu.com/2017/11/xenoblade-chronicles-2-adds-kos-mos-re-xenosaga-rare-blade | title=Xenoblade Chronicles 2 adds KOS-MOS Re: from Xenosaga as Rare Blade | work=Gematsu| first=Sal | last=Romano | date=November 30, 2017 | accessdate=February 21, 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Synopsis ==\n=== Setting ===\nThe game is set in Alrest, which has no continental landmasses, but instead is made of a sea topped with clouds, called the \"Cloud Sea\" and inhabited by massive creatures known as titans on which smaller creatures reside. Legends claim humanity once lived atop the World Tree in a paradise called Elysium with their creator, the Architect, but they were exiled for unknown reasons and given the Titans to live on. Blades are powerful beings summoned from \"Core Crystals\" who channel power into their weapons through a force called ether. Their masters are called Drivers; when a Driver dies, their Blade reverts to a Core Crystal and lose their memory. After some time, another Driver can awaken them so long as the crystal is intact. At the game's start, the nation-states of Mor Ardain and Uraya are on the brink of war.\n\n=== Plot ===\nRex, an orphaned salvager who collects treasure from below the Cloud Sea for money, is hired by Argentum Trade Guild Chairman Bana to aid the Drivers Jin, Malos, and Nia, part of a group named Torna, in the salvage of an ancient ship. In the ship, they find Pyra, a legendary Blade known as an Aegis. When Rex reaches out to touch Pyra's sword, Jin fatally stabs him. Rex awakens on a field with Pyra, who reveals they are in a memory of her old home Elysium. She asks him to bring her to Elysium and in exchange gives him half of her Core Crystal to revive him. With help from his Titan companion Gramps and Nia, who has defected from Torna, Rex escapes to the Titan Gormott, but Gramps is wounded and reverts to his larval stage. Soon after, they arrive in Gormott's capital Torigoth and are joined by the Nopon Driver Tora and his artificial Blade Poppi. The group try to get to the World Tree, but are stopped by the Artifice Ophion and swallowed by the Titan Uraya.\n\nAfter the group battles the mercenary Driver Vandham while escaping Uraya's stomach, he joins the party and Rex begins to look to him as a mentor. The group later learns that Jin and Malos are the leaders of Torna, a terrorist group named after a Titan destroyed in the Aegis War 500 years ago. Led by Jin, who is revealed to have fought against Malos 500 years ago, and Malos, later revealed as an Aegis, they seek to destroy humanity by unleashing the Artifice Aion on the World Tree and killing the Architect. During a battle with Malos and fellow Torna member; Akhos, Vandham is killed and Pyra unveils her true form Mythra. They have shared memory and consider themselves sisters, switching back and forth as needed.\n\nThe group's search for a way past Ophion leads them to join forces with M\u00f3rag, the Ardainian emperor Niall's elder sister; and Zeke, prince of Tantal on the Titan Genbu. Malos's Driver Amalthus later summons the party to Indol, which controls Core Crystal distribution. After Amalthus attempts peace talks between Uraya and Mor Ardain, the group stops Bana's attempt to kill Niall.\n\nLater on, in Tantal, the group battles Jin, who forces Pyra to surrender. While Gramps leads the group to the third Aegis sword to save Pyra, Malos siphons Pyra's power to regain his full strength. After the group finds the third sword, phantoms of Addam nearly kill Rex. To save him, Nia reveals herself as a Flesh Eater (a Blade made human by devouring his Driver, which every member of Torna except Malos is), and Addam's spirit deems Rex worthy of the third sword. The group confronts Jin and Malos at the Cliffs of Morytha near the World Tree, during which Rex unlocks Pyra and Mythra's true form Pneuma. Rex, now matched with Jin's power, forces Malos to summon Ophion, who knocks the group into the abyss beneath the World Tree.\n\nIn the Land of Morytha, under the Cloud Sea, the group is forced to work with a weakened Jin. Soon after, Amalthus, revealed to be just as bent on wiping out humanity and the reason for Malos' malicious nature,  attacks the World Tree by controlling various Titans. The group severs his connection to the Titans, only for him to kill all Torna members except Malos and Jin, the later of which defeats him before dying redeemed. The group arrives in Elysium and meet the Architect, a scientist named Klaus. He explains that, long ago, he discovered a device called the Conduit that sends objects into different dimensions, the use of which split his body in two and destroyed the old world.{{efn|The Architect's other half was sent to an alternate dimension, the setting of [[Xenoblade Chronicles|the first ''Xenoblade Chronicles'']].}}\n\nSensing that his other half is about to die, which will result in his own death, Klaus sends the group to stop Malos, who has obtained Aion. After Malos's defeat and death, Klaus dies, but not before granting Rex and the party \"one final gift.\" Klaus's death causes the Conduit to shut off; without the Conduit, the World Tree begins to crumble, which will destroy Alrest. Pneuma helps the group escape, but sacrifices herself to detonate the World Tree. The group barely survives when Gramps, thanks to Pneuma, returns to his adult form and flies everyone down to Alrest. As part of Klaus's \"last gift\", the Cloud Sea fades to reveal a new world and the Titans merge to form a new landmass. Afterwards, Pyra and Mythra are revived in separate bodies and reunite with Rex.\n\n== Development ==\nThe game is the third title in [[Monolith Soft]]'s ''[[Xenoblade Chronicles]]'' series, following the original ''[[Xenoblade Chronicles (video game)|Xenoblade Chronicles]]'' and ''[[Xenoblade Chronicles X]]''.<ref name=\"GameInformerPrev1\">{{cite web|last=Wallace|first=Kimberley|title=Xenoblade Chronicles 2: Big World, Big Battles, Big Changes|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/games/xenoblade_chronicles_2/b/switch/archive/2017/11/07/xenoblade-chronicles-2-hands-on-feature.aspx?PostPageIndex=1|website=[[Game Informer]]|date=November 7, 2017|accessdate=December 14, 2017|page=1}}</ref> Plans for the game began as early as July 2014, during the latter half of development of ''Xenoblade Chronicles X'', out of the negative fan reaction from changes implemented in the title.<ref name=\"SilOrigins\">{{cite web|author=Sato|title=Xenoblade Chronicles 2 Devs Explain Why There Are So Many Female Rare Blades|url=http://www.siliconera.com/2017/11/28/xenoblade-chronicles-2-devs-talk-many-female-rare-blades-super-rare/|website=Siliconera|date=November 28, 2017|accessdate=November 28, 2017}}</ref> While the original ''Xenoblade Chronicles'' followed the typical structure of a general story-driven [[JRPG]], ''Xenoblade Chronicles X'' received far less emphasis on story, and was organized in more of a mission-based structure, focused primarily on exploring the game's massive [[open world]].<ref name=\"GameInformerPrev1\"/> The development grew impatient upon hearing the fanbase complain about the changes, and started work on another story-driven title.<ref name=\"SilOrigins\"/> Because the gameplay was more of a continuation of the first title, they decided to title it ''Xenoblade Chronicles 2''.<ref name=\"SilOrigins\"/> Initial work on the game was difficult because the [[technical specifications]] of the [[Nintendo Switch]] were not yet finalized or known yet,<ref name=\"SilOrigins\"/> but once it was finalized, the game featured a shorter development period compared to the prior titles, with executive director [[Tetsuya Takahashi]] citing being able to use the technological foundation established in ''Xenoblade Chronicles X'' as a means of speeding up development time.<ref name=\"TimeMag1\"/><ref name=\"Gem1\">{{cite web|url=https://gematsu.com/2017/01/xenoblade-chronicles-2-announced-switch |title=Xenoblade Chronicles 2 announced for Switch |work=Gematsu |first=Sal |last=Romano |date=January 12, 2017 |accessdate=January 14, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170116152646/https://gematsu.com/2017/01/xenoblade-chronicles-2-announced-switch |archivedate=January 16, 2017 }}</ref> Another motivating factor was the agreement made by the team with [[Nintendo]] specifically to deliver the game early on in the Nintendo Switch's lifecycle.<ref name=\"TimeMag1\">{{cite web|first=Matt |last=Peckham |title=Why 'Xenoblade Chronicles 2' Has a Character Designed by Tetsuya Nomura  |url=http://time.com/4848935/xenoblade-chronicles-2-interview/ |website=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=July 7, 2017 |accessdate=July 28, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nOne of Monolith Soft's objectives for the game was to give the characters a wider range of facial expressions compared to past ''Xenoblade'' titles.

More story, more enemies to scrap with, more landscapes to tread across.

He stated: \"''Xenoblade 2'' consistently displays a frustrating lack of respect for the player\u2019s time.

The only difference in their analytic representations is the complex amplitude (phasor). A linear combination of such functions can be factored into the product of a linear combination of phasors (known as '''phasor arithmetic''') and the time/frequency dependent factor that they all have in common.\n\nThe origin of the term phasor rightfully suggests that a (diagrammatic) calculus somewhat similar to that possible for [[Euclidean vector|vectors]] is possible for phasors as well.<ref name=\"Hindmarsh2014\"/> An important additional feature of the phasor transform is that [[derivative|differentiation]] and [[integral|integration]] of sinusoidal signals (having constant amplitude, period and phase) corresponds to simple algebraic operations on the phasors; the phasor transform thus allows the [[Network analysis (electrical circuits)|analysis]] (calculation) of the [[alternating current|AC]] [[steady state (electronics)|steady state]] of [[RLC circuit]]s by solving simple [[algebraic equation]]s (albeit with complex coefficients) in the phasor domain instead of solving [[differential equation]]s (with real coefficients) in the time domain.<ref name=\"Eccles2011\">{{cite book|author=William J.

In particular it is ''not'' the shorthand notation for another phasor.  Multiplying a phasor current by an impedance produces a phasor voltage.  But the product of two phasors (or squaring a phasor) would represent the product of two sinusoids, which is a non-linear operation that produces new frequency components. Phasor notation can only represent systems with one frequency, such as a linear system stimulated by a sinusoid.\n\n=== Addition ===\n[[File:sumafasores.gif|thumb|right|The sum of phasors as addition of rotating vectors]]The sum of multiple phasors produces another phasor.

The time and frequency dependence can be suppressed and re-inserted into the outcome as long as the only operations used in between are ones that produce another phasor. In [[angle notation]], the operation shown above is written\n:<math>A_1 \\angle \\theta_1 + A_2 \\angle \\theta_2 = A_3 \\angle \\theta_3. \\, </math>\n\nAnother way to view addition is that two '''vectors''' with coordinates {{nowrap|[&nbsp;''A''<sub>1</sub> cos(''\u03c9t'' + ''\u03b8''<sub>1</sub>), ''A''<sub>1</sub> sin(''\u03c9t'' + ''\u03b8''<sub>1</sub>)&nbsp;]}} and {{nowrap|[&nbsp;''A''<sub>2</sub> cos(''\u03c9t'' + ''\u03b8''<sub>2</sub>), ''A''<sub>2</sub> sin(''\u03c9t'' + ''\u03b8''<sub>2</sub>)&nbsp;]}} are [[vector (geometric)#Vector addition and subtraction|added vectorially]] to produce a resultant vector with coordinates {{nowrap|[&nbsp;''A''<sub>3</sub> cos(''\u03c9t'' + ''\u03b8''<sub>3</sub>), ''A''<sub>3</sub> sin(''\u03c9t'' + ''\u03b8''<sub>3</sub>)&nbsp;]}}. (see animation)\n\n[[Image:destructive interference.png|thumb|right|Phasor diagram of three waves in perfect destructive interference]]\nIn physics, this sort of addition occurs when sinusoids [[Interference (wave propagation)|interfere]] with each other, constructively or destructively.  The static vector concept provides useful insight into questions like this: \"''What phase difference would be required between three identical sinusoids for perfect cancellation?''\" In this case, simply imagine taking three vectors of equal length and placing them head to tail such that the last head matches up with the first tail.  Clearly, the shape which satisfies these conditions is an equilateral [[triangle]], so the angle between each phasor to the next is 120\u00b0 ({{frac|3{{pi}}|2}}&nbsp;radians), or one third of a wavelength {{frac|{{var|\u03bb}}|3}}. So the phase difference between each wave must also be 120\u00b0, as is the case in [[three-phase power]]\n\nIn other words, what this shows is that\n:<math>\\cos(\\omega t) + \\cos(\\omega t + 2\\pi/3) + \\cos(\\omega t -2\\pi/3) = 0.\\,</math>\n\nIn the example of three waves, the phase difference between the first and the last wave was 240&nbsp;degrees, while for two waves destructive interference happens at 180 degrees. In the limit of many waves, the phasors must form a circle for destructive interference, so that the first phasor is nearly parallel with the last. This means that for many sources, destructive interference happens when the first and last wave differ by 360 degrees, a full wavelength <math>\\lambda</math>. This is why in single slit [[diffraction]], the minima occur when [[light]] from the far edge travels a full wavelength further than the light from the near edge.\n\nAs the single vector rotates in an anti-clockwise direction, its tip at point A will rotate one complete revolution of 360\u00b0 or 2{{pi}}&nbsp;radians representing one complete cycle. If the length of its moving tip is transferred at different angular intervals in time to a graph as shown above, a sinusoidal waveform would be drawn starting at the left with zero time. Each position along the horizontal axis indicates the time that has elapsed since zero time, ''t''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0. When the vector is horizontal the tip of the vector represents the angles at 0\u00b0, 180\u00b0, and at 360\u00b0.\n\nLikewise, when the tip of the vector is vertical it represents the positive peak value, (&nbsp;+''A''<sub>max</sub>&nbsp;) at 90\u00b0 or {{frac|{{pi}}|2}} and the negative peak value, (&nbsp;&minus;''A''<sub>max</sub>&nbsp;) at 270\u00b0 or {{frac|3{{pi}}|2}}. Then the time axis of the waveform represents the angle either in degrees or radians through which the phasor has moved. So we can say that a phasor represent a scaled voltage or current value of a rotating vector which is \u201cfrozen\u201d at some point in time, (&nbsp;''t''&nbsp;) and in our example above, this is at an angle of 30\u00b0.\n\nSometimes when we are analysing alternating waveforms we may need to know the position of the phasor, representing the alternating quantity at some particular instant in time especially when we want to compare two different waveforms on the same axis. For example, voltage and current. We have assumed in the waveform above that the waveform starts at time ''t''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 with a corresponding phase angle in either degrees or radians.\n\nBut if a second waveform starts to the left or to the right of this zero point, or if we want to represent in phasor notation the relationship between the two waveforms, then we will need to take into account this phase difference, {{var|\u03a6}} of the waveform. Consider the diagram below from the previous Phase Difference tutorial.\n\n=== Differentiation and integration ===\nThe time derivative or integral of a phasor produces another phasor.{{efn|\nThis results from <math>\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d} t}(e^{i \\omega t}) = i \\omega e^{i \\omega t}</math>,\n\nwhich means that the [[complex exponential]] is the [[eigenfunction]] of the [[derivative]] operation.\n}}  For example:\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\operatorname{Re}\\left\\{\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d} t}(A e^{i\\theta} \\cdot e^{i\\omega t})\\right\\}= \\operatorname{Re}\\{A e^{i\\theta} \\cdot i\\omega e^{i\\omega t}\\} = \\operatorname{Re}\\{A e^{i\\theta} \\cdot e^{i\\pi/2} \\omega e^{i\\omega t}\\} = \\operatorname{Re}\\{\\omega A e^{i(\\theta + \\pi/2)} \\cdot e^{i\\omega t}\\} = \\omega A\\cdot \\cos(\\omega t + \\theta + \\pi/2)\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nTherefore, in phasor representation, the time derivative of a sinusoid becomes just multiplication by the constant <math>i \\omega = (e^{i\\pi/2} \\cdot \\omega)\\,</math>.\n\nSimilarly, integrating a phasor corresponds to multiplication by <math>\\frac{1}{i\\omega} = \\frac{e^{-i\\pi/2}}{\\omega}\\,</math>. The time-dependent factor, <math>e^{i\\omega t}\\,</math>, is unaffected.\n\nWhen we solve a [[linear differential equation]] with phasor arithmetic, we are merely factoring <math>e^{i\\omega t}\\,</math> out of all terms of the equation, and reinserting it into the answer. For example, consider the following differential equation for the voltage across the capacitor in an [[RC circuit]]:\n:<math>\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\ v_C(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t} + \\frac{1}{RC}v_C(t) = \\frac{1}{RC}v_S(t)</math>\n\nWhen the voltage source in this circuit is sinusoidal:\n:<math>v_S(t) = V_P\\cdot \\cos(\\omega t + \\theta),\\,</math>\n\nwe may substitute <math>\n\\begin{align}\nv_S(t) &= \\operatorname{Re} \\{V_s \\cdot e^{i\\omega t}\\} \\\\\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n:<math>v_C(t) = \\operatorname{Re} \\{V_c \\cdot e^{i\\omega t}\\},</math>\n\nwhere phasor <math>V_s = V_P e^{i\\theta}\\,</math>, and phasor <math>V_c\\,</math> is the unknown quantity to be determined.\n\nIn the phasor shorthand notation, the differential equation reduces to\n:<math>i \\omega V_c + \\frac{1}{RC} V_c = \\frac{1}{RC}V_s</math>&nbsp;{{efn|\n;Proof:\n{{NumBlk|:|\n<math>\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\ \\operatorname{Re} \\{V_c \\cdot e^{i\\omega t}\\}}{\\mathrm{d}t} + \\frac{1}{RC}\\operatorname{Re} \\{V_c \\cdot e^{i\\omega t}\\} = \\frac{1}{RC}\\operatorname{Re} \\{V_s \\cdot e^{i\\omega t}\\}</math>\n|{{EquationRef|Eq.1}}}}\n\nSince this must hold for all <math>t\\,</math>, specifically: <math>t - \\frac{\\pi}{2\\omega }\\,</math>, it follows that\n{{NumBlk|:|\n<math>\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\ \\operatorname{Im} \\{V_c \\cdot e^{i\\omega t}\\}}{\\mathrm{d}t} + \\frac{1}{RC}\\operatorname{Im} \\{V_c \\cdot e^{i\\omega t}\\} = \\frac{1}{RC}\\operatorname{Im} \\{V_s \\cdot e^{i\\omega t}\\}</math>\n|{{EquationRef|Eq.2}}}}\n\nIt is also readily seen that\n:<math>\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\ \\operatorname{Re} \\{V_c \\cdot e^{i\\omega t}\\}}{\\mathrm{d}t} \n= \\operatorname{Re} \\left\\{ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\left( V_c \\cdot e^{i\\omega t}\\right)}{\\mathrm{d}t} \\right\\}\n= \\operatorname{Re} \\left\\{ i\\omega V_c \\cdot e^{i\\omega t} \\right\\}</math>\n\n:<math>\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\ \\operatorname{Im} \\{V_c \\cdot e^{i\\omega t}\\}}{\\mathrm{d}t} \n= \\operatorname{Im} \\left\\{ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\left( V_c \\cdot e^{i\\omega t}\\right)}{\\mathrm{d}t} \\right\\}\n= \\operatorname{Im} \\left\\{ i\\omega V_c \\cdot e^{i\\omega t} \\right\\}</math>\n\n\nSubstituting these into &nbsp;{{EquationNote|Eq.1}} and &nbsp;{{EquationNote|Eq.2}}, multiplying &nbsp;{{EquationNote|Eq.2}} by <math>i,\\,</math>&nbsp; and adding both equations gives\n:<math>i\\omega V_c \\cdot e^{i\\omega t} + \\frac{1}{RC}V_c \\cdot e^{i\\omega t} = \\frac{1}{RC}V_s \\cdot e^{i\\omega t}</math>\n\n:<math>\\left(i\\omega V_c + \\frac{1}{RC}V_c \\right) \\cdot e^{i\\omega t} = \\left( \\frac{1}{RC}V_s\\right) \\cdot e^{i\\omega t}</math>\n\n:<math>i\\omega V_c + \\frac{1}{RC}V_c = \\frac{1}{RC}V_s \\quad\\quad(\\mathrm{QED})</math>\n}}\n\nSolving for the phasor capacitor voltage gives\n:<math>\nV_c = \\frac{1}{1 + i \\omega RC} \\cdot (V_s) = \\frac{1-i\\omega R C}{1+(\\omega R C)^2} \\cdot (V_P e^{i\\theta})\\,\n</math>\n\nAs we have seen, the factor multiplying <math>V_s\\,</math> represents differences of the amplitude and phase of <math>v_C(t)\\,</math>&nbsp; relative to <math>V_P\\,</math>&nbsp; and <math>\\theta\\,</math>.\n\nIn polar coordinate form, it is\n:<math>\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 + (\\omega RC)^2}}\\cdot e^{-i \\phi(\\omega)},\\text{ where }\\phi(\\omega) = \\arctan(\\omega RC).\\,</math>\n\nTherefore\n:<math>v_C(t) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 + (\\omega RC)^2}}\\cdot V_P \\cos(\\omega t + \\theta- \\phi(\\omega))</math>\n\n== Applications ==\n\n=== Circuit laws ===\n\nWith phasors, the techniques for solving [[Direct current|DC]] circuits can be applied to solve AC circuits.  A list of the basic laws is given below.\n\n* '''Ohm's law for resistors:''' a resistor has no time delays and therefore doesn't change the phase of a signal therefore ''V''=''IR'' remains valid.\n* '''Ohm's law for resistors, inductors, and capacitors:''' ''V''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''IZ'' where ''Z'' is the complex [[electrical impedance|impedance]]. <!-- we probably want a justification of this somewhere-->\n* In an AC circuit we have real power (''P'') which is a representation of the average power into the circuit and reactive power (''Q'') which indicates power flowing back and forth. We can also define the [[complex power]] ''S''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''P''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''jQ'' and the apparent power which is the magnitude of ''S''. The power law for an AC circuit expressed in phasors is then ''S''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''VI''<sup>*</sup> (where ''I''<sup>*</sup> is the [[complex conjugate]] of ''I'', and the magnitudes of the voltage and current phasors ''V'' and ''I'' are the [[Root mean square#Definition|RMS]] values of the voltage and current, respectively).\n* [[Kirchhoff's circuit laws]] work with phasors in complex form\n\nGiven this we can apply the techniques of [[analysis of resistive circuits]] with phasors to analyze single frequency AC circuits containing resistors, capacitors, and inductors. Multiple frequency linear AC circuits and AC circuits with different waveforms can be analyzed to find voltages and currents by transforming all waveforms to sine wave components with magnitude and phase then analyzing each frequency separately, as allowed by the [[superposition theorem]]. This solution method applies only to inputs that are sinusoidal and for solutions that are in steady state, i.e., after all transients have died out.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Introduction to electromagnetic compatibility|last=Clayton|first=Paul|publisher=Wiley|year=2008|isbn=978-81-265-2875-2|location=|pages=861}}</ref>\n\nThe concept is frequently involved in representing an [[electrical impedance]]. In this case, the phase angle is the [[phase difference]] between the voltage applied to the impedance and the current driven through it.\n\n===Power engineering===\nIn analysis of [[three phase]] AC power systems, usually a set of phasors is defined as the three complex cube roots of unity, graphically represented as unit magnitudes at angles of 0, 120 and 240 degrees. By treating polyphase AC circuit quantities as phasors, balanced circuits can be simplified and unbalanced circuits can be treated as an algebraic combination of [[symmetrical components]]. This approach greatly simplifies the work required in electrical calculations of voltage drop, power flow, and short-circuit currents. In the context of power systems analysis, the phase angle is often given in [[Degree (angle)|degree]]s, and the magnitude in [[Root Mean Square|rms]] value rather than the peak amplitude of the sinusoid.\n\nThe technique of [[synchrophasor]]s uses digital instruments to measure the phasors representing transmission system voltages at widespread points in a transmission network.  Differences among the phasors indicate power flow and system stability.\n\n=== Telecommunications: analog modulations ===\n\nThe rotating frame picture using phasor can be a powerful tool to understand analog modulations such as [[amplitude modulation]] (and its variants <ref name=IJRES>de Oliveira, H.M. and Nunes, F.D.

The only difference in their analytic representations is the complex amplitude (phasor). A linear combination of such functions can be factored into the product of a linear combination of phasors (known as '''phasor arithmetic''') and the time/frequency dependent factor that they all have in common.\n\nThe origin of the term phasor rightfully suggests that a (diagrammatic) calculus somewhat similar to that possible for [[Euclidean vector|vectors]] is possible for phasors as well.<ref name=\"Hindmarsh2014\"/> An important additional feature of the phasor transform is that [[derivative|differentiation]] and [[integral|integration]] of sinusoidal signals (having constant amplitude, period and phase) corresponds to simple algebraic operations on the phasors; the phasor transform thus allows the [[Network analysis (electrical circuits)|analysis]] (calculation) of the [[alternating current|AC]] [[steady state (electronics)|steady state]] of [[RLC circuit]]s by solving simple [[algebraic equation]]s (albeit with complex coefficients) in the phasor domain instead of solving [[differential equation]]s (with real coefficients) in the time domain.<ref name=\"Eccles2011\">{{cite book|author=William J.

But the product of two phasors (or squaring a phasor) would represent the product of two sinusoids, which is a non-linear operation that produces new frequency components. Phasor notation can only represent systems with one frequency, such as a linear system stimulated by a sinusoid.\n\n=== Addition ===\n[[File:sumafasores.gif|thumb|right|The sum of phasors as addition of rotating vectors]]The sum of multiple phasors produces another phasor.

The time and frequency dependence can be suppressed and re-inserted into the outcome as long as the only operations used in between are ones that produce another phasor. In [[angle notation]], the operation shown above is written\n:<math>A_1 \\angle \\theta_1 + A_2 \\angle \\theta_2 = A_3 \\angle \\theta_3. \\, </math>\n\nAnother way to view addition is that two '''vectors''' with coordinates {{nowrap|[&nbsp;''A''<sub>1</sub> cos(''\u03c9t'' + ''\u03b8''<sub>1</sub>), ''A''<sub>1</sub> sin(''\u03c9t'' + ''\u03b8''<sub>1</sub>)&nbsp;]}} and {{nowrap|[&nbsp;''A''<sub>2</sub> cos(''\u03c9t'' + ''\u03b8''<sub>2</sub>), ''A''<sub>2</sub> sin(''\u03c9t'' + ''\u03b8''<sub>2</sub>)&nbsp;]}} are [[vector (geometric)#Vector addition and subtraction|added vectorially]] to produce a resultant vector with coordinates {{nowrap|[&nbsp;''A''<sub>3</sub> cos(''\u03c9t'' + ''\u03b8''<sub>3</sub>), ''A''<sub>3</sub> sin(''\u03c9t'' + ''\u03b8''<sub>3</sub>)&nbsp;]}}. (see animation)\n\n[[Image:destructive interference.png|thumb|right|Phasor diagram of three waves in perfect destructive interference]]\nIn physics, this sort of addition occurs when sinusoids [[Interference (wave propagation)|interfere]] with each other, constructively or destructively.  The static vector concept provides useful insight into questions like this: \"''What phase difference would be required between three identical sinusoids for perfect cancellation?''\" In this case, simply imagine taking three vectors of equal length and placing them head to tail such that the last head matches up with the first tail.  Clearly, the shape which satisfies these conditions is an equilateral [[triangle]], so the angle between each phasor to the next is 120\u00b0 ({{frac|3{{pi}}|2}}&nbsp;radians), or one third of a wavelength {{frac|{{var|\u03bb}}|3}}. So the phase difference between each wave must also be 120\u00b0, as is the case in [[three-phase power]]\n\nIn other words, what this shows is that\n:<math>\\cos(\\omega t) + \\cos(\\omega t + 2\\pi/3) + \\cos(\\omega t -2\\pi/3) = 0.\\,</math>\n\nIn the example of three waves, the phase difference between the first and the last wave was 240&nbsp;degrees, while for two waves destructive interference happens at 180 degrees. In the limit of many waves, the phasors must form a circle for destructive interference, so that the first phasor is nearly parallel with the last. This means that for many sources, destructive interference happens when the first and last wave differ by 360 degrees, a full wavelength <math>\\lambda</math>. This is why in single slit [[diffraction]], the minima occur when [[light]] from the far edge travels a full wavelength further than the light from the near edge.\n\nAs the single vector rotates in an anti-clockwise direction, its tip at point A will rotate one complete revolution of 360\u00b0 or 2{{pi}}&nbsp;radians representing one complete cycle. If the length of its moving tip is transferred at different angular intervals in time to a graph as shown above, a sinusoidal waveform would be drawn starting at the left with zero time. Each position along the horizontal axis indicates the time that has elapsed since zero time, ''t''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0. When the vector is horizontal the tip of the vector represents the angles at 0\u00b0, 180\u00b0, and at 360\u00b0.\n\nLikewise, when the tip of the vector is vertical it represents the positive peak value, (&nbsp;+''A''<sub>max</sub>&nbsp;) at 90\u00b0 or {{frac|{{pi}}|2}} and the negative peak value, (&nbsp;&minus;''A''<sub>max</sub>&nbsp;) at 270\u00b0 or {{frac|3{{pi}}|2}}. Then the time axis of the waveform represents the angle either in degrees or radians through which the phasor has moved. So we can say that a phasor represent a scaled voltage or current value of a rotating vector which is \u201cfrozen\u201d at some point in time, (&nbsp;''t''&nbsp;) and in our example above, this is at an angle of 30\u00b0.\n\nSometimes when we are analysing alternating waveforms we may need to know the position of the phasor, representing the alternating quantity at some particular instant in time especially when we want to compare two different waveforms on the same axis. For example, voltage and current. We have assumed in the waveform above that the waveform starts at time ''t''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 with a corresponding phase angle in either degrees or radians.\n\nBut if a second waveform starts to the left or to the right of this zero point, or if we want to represent in phasor notation the relationship between the two waveforms, then we will need to take into account this phase difference, {{var|\u03a6}} of the waveform. Consider the diagram below from the previous Phase Difference tutorial.\n\n=== Differentiation and integration ===\nThe time derivative or integral of a phasor produces another phasor.{{efn|\nThis results from <math>\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d} t}(e^{i \\omega t}) = i \\omega e^{i \\omega t}</math>,\n\nwhich means that the [[complex exponential]] is the [[eigenfunction]] of the [[derivative]] operation.\n}}  For example:\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\operatorname{Re}\\left\\{\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d} t}(A e^{i\\theta} \\cdot e^{i\\omega t})\\right\\}= \\operatorname{Re}\\{A e^{i\\theta} \\cdot i\\omega e^{i\\omega t}\\} = \\operatorname{Re}\\{A e^{i\\theta} \\cdot e^{i\\pi/2} \\omega e^{i\\omega t}\\} = \\operatorname{Re}\\{\\omega A e^{i(\\theta + \\pi/2)} \\cdot e^{i\\omega t}\\} = \\omega A\\cdot \\cos(\\omega t + \\theta + \\pi/2)\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nTherefore, in phasor representation, the time derivative of a sinusoid becomes just multiplication by the constant <math>i \\omega = (e^{i\\pi/2} \\cdot \\omega)\\,</math>.\n\nSimilarly, integrating a phasor corresponds to multiplication by <math>\\frac{1}{i\\omega} = \\frac{e^{-i\\pi/2}}{\\omega}\\,</math>. The time-dependent factor, <math>e^{i\\omega t}\\,</math>, is unaffected.\n\nWhen we solve a [[linear differential equation]] with phasor arithmetic, we are merely factoring <math>e^{i\\omega t}\\,</math> out of all terms of the equation, and reinserting it into the answer. For example, consider the following differential equation for the voltage across the capacitor in an [[RC circuit]]:\n:<math>\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\ v_C(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t} + \\frac{1}{RC}v_C(t) = \\frac{1}{RC}v_S(t)</math>\n\nWhen the voltage source in this circuit is sinusoidal:\n:<math>v_S(t) = V_P\\cdot \\cos(\\omega t + \\theta),\\,</math>\n\nwe may substitute <math>\n\\begin{align}\nv_S(t) &= \\operatorname{Re} \\{V_s \\cdot e^{i\\omega t}\\} \\\\\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n:<math>v_C(t) = \\operatorname{Re} \\{V_c \\cdot e^{i\\omega t}\\},</math>\n\nwhere phasor <math>V_s = V_P e^{i\\theta}\\,</math>, and phasor <math>V_c\\,</math> is the unknown quantity to be determined.\n\nIn the phasor shorthand notation, the differential equation reduces to\n:<math>i \\omega V_c + \\frac{1}{RC} V_c = \\frac{1}{RC}V_s</math>&nbsp;{{efn|\n;Proof:\n{{NumBlk|:|\n<math>\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\ \\operatorname{Re} \\{V_c \\cdot e^{i\\omega t}\\}}{\\mathrm{d}t} + \\frac{1}{RC}\\operatorname{Re} \\{V_c \\cdot e^{i\\omega t}\\} = \\frac{1}{RC}\\operatorname{Re} \\{V_s \\cdot e^{i\\omega t}\\}</math>\n|{{EquationRef|Eq.1}}}}\n\nSince this must hold for all <math>t\\,</math>, specifically: <math>t - \\frac{\\pi}{2\\omega }\\,</math>, it follows that\n{{NumBlk|:|\n<math>\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\ \\operatorname{Im} \\{V_c \\cdot e^{i\\omega t}\\}}{\\mathrm{d}t} + \\frac{1}{RC}\\operatorname{Im} \\{V_c \\cdot e^{i\\omega t}\\} = \\frac{1}{RC}\\operatorname{Im} \\{V_s \\cdot e^{i\\omega t}\\}</math>\n|{{EquationRef|Eq.2}}}}\n\nIt is also readily seen that\n:<math>\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\ \\operatorname{Re} \\{V_c \\cdot e^{i\\omega t}\\}}{\\mathrm{d}t} \n= \\operatorname{Re} \\left\\{ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\left( V_c \\cdot e^{i\\omega t}\\right)}{\\mathrm{d}t} \\right\\}\n= \\operatorname{Re} \\left\\{ i\\omega V_c \\cdot e^{i\\omega t} \\right\\}</math>\n\n:<math>\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\ \\operatorname{Im} \\{V_c \\cdot e^{i\\omega t}\\}}{\\mathrm{d}t} \n= \\operatorname{Im} \\left\\{ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\left( V_c \\cdot e^{i\\omega t}\\right)}{\\mathrm{d}t} \\right\\}\n= \\operatorname{Im} \\left\\{ i\\omega V_c \\cdot e^{i\\omega t} \\right\\}</math>\n\n\nSubstituting these into &nbsp;{{EquationNote|Eq.1}} and &nbsp;{{EquationNote|Eq.2}}, multiplying &nbsp;{{EquationNote|Eq.2}} by <math>i,\\,</math>&nbsp; and adding both equations gives\n:<math>i\\omega V_c \\cdot e^{i\\omega t} + \\frac{1}{RC}V_c \\cdot e^{i\\omega t} = \\frac{1}{RC}V_s \\cdot e^{i\\omega t}</math>\n\n:<math>\\left(i\\omega V_c + \\frac{1}{RC}V_c \\right) \\cdot e^{i\\omega t} = \\left( \\frac{1}{RC}V_s\\right) \\cdot e^{i\\omega t}</math>\n\n:<math>i\\omega V_c + \\frac{1}{RC}V_c = \\frac{1}{RC}V_s \\quad\\quad(\\mathrm{QED})</math>\n}}\n\nSolving for the phasor capacitor voltage gives\n:<math>\nV_c = \\frac{1}{1 + i \\omega RC} \\cdot (V_s) = \\frac{1-i\\omega R C}{1+(\\omega R C)^2} \\cdot (V_P e^{i\\theta})\\,\n</math>\n\nAs we have seen, the factor multiplying <math>V_s\\,</math> represents differences of the amplitude and phase of <math>v_C(t)\\,</math>&nbsp; relative to <math>V_P\\,</math>&nbsp; and <math>\\theta\\,</math>.\n\nIn polar coordinate form, it is\n:<math>\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 + (\\omega RC)^2}}\\cdot e^{-i \\phi(\\omega)},\\text{ where }\\phi(\\omega) = \\arctan(\\omega RC).\\,</math>\n\nTherefore\n:<math>v_C(t) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 + (\\omega RC)^2}}\\cdot V_P \\cos(\\omega t + \\theta- \\phi(\\omega))</math>\n\n== Applications ==\n\n=== Circuit laws ===\n\nWith phasors, the techniques for solving [[Direct current|DC]] circuits can be applied to solve AC circuits.  A list of the basic laws is given below.\n\n* '''Ohm's law for resistors:''' a resistor has no time delays and therefore doesn't change the phase of a signal therefore ''V''=''IR'' remains valid.\n* '''Ohm's law for resistors, inductors, and capacitors:''' ''V''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''IZ'' where ''Z'' is the complex [[electrical impedance|impedance]]. <!-- we probably want a justification of this somewhere-->\n* In an AC circuit we have real power (''P'') which is a representation of the average power into the circuit and reactive power (''Q'') which indicates power flowing back and forth. We can also define the [[complex power]] ''S''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''P''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''jQ'' and the apparent power which is the magnitude of ''S''. The power law for an AC circuit expressed in phasors is then ''S''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''VI''<sup>*</sup> (where ''I''<sup>*</sup> is the [[complex conjugate]] of ''I'', and the magnitudes of the voltage and current phasors ''V'' and ''I'' are the [[Root mean square#Definition|RMS]] values of the voltage and current, respectively).\n* [[Kirchhoff's circuit laws]] work with phasors in complex form\n\nGiven this we can apply the techniques of [[analysis of resistive circuits]] with phasors to analyze single frequency AC circuits containing resistors, capacitors, and inductors. Multiple frequency linear AC circuits and AC circuits with different waveforms can be analyzed to find voltages and currents by transforming all waveforms to sine wave components with magnitude and phase then analyzing each frequency separately, as allowed by the [[superposition theorem]]. This solution method applies only to inputs that are sinusoidal and for solutions that are in steady state, i.e., after all transients have died out.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Introduction to electromagnetic compatibility|last=Clayton|first=Paul|publisher=Wiley|year=2008|isbn=978-81-265-2875-2|location=|pages=861}}</ref>\n\nThe concept is frequently involved in representing an [[electrical impedance]]. In this case, the phase angle is the [[phase difference]] between the voltage applied to the impedance and the current driven through it.\n\n===Power engineering===\nIn analysis of [[three phase]] AC power systems, usually a set of phasors is defined as the three complex cube roots of unity, graphically represented as unit magnitudes at angles of 0, 120 and 240 degrees. By treating polyphase AC circuit quantities as phasors, balanced circuits can be simplified and unbalanced circuits can be treated as an algebraic combination of [[symmetrical components]]. This approach greatly simplifies the work required in electrical calculations of voltage drop, power flow, and short-circuit currents. In the context of power systems analysis, the phase angle is often given in [[Degree (angle)|degree]]s, and the magnitude in [[Root Mean Square|rms]] value rather than the peak amplitude of the sinusoid.\n\nThe technique of [[synchrophasor]]s uses digital instruments to measure the phasors representing transmission system voltages at widespread points in a transmission network.  Differences among the phasors indicate power flow and system stability.\n\n=== Telecommunications: analog modulations ===\n\nThe rotating frame picture using phasor can be a powerful tool to understand analog modulations such as [[amplitude modulation]] (and its variants <ref name=IJRES>de Oliveira, H.M. and Nunes, F.D.

Joyce is a very caring and strong-willed woman who works as a retail clerk at Melvald's General Store in downtown Hawkins. She was born and raised in Hawkins and she attended Hawkins High School with the future chief of police, Jim Hopper, and her Season Two love interest, Bob Newby (who is later unfortunately killed by a demogorgon). In Season Three, she is planning to sell her house and move out of Hawkins, much to the dismay of Hopper who tries to convince her to go on a date with him. Even though she does have feelings for him, Joyce tries to avoid getting in another relationship. She is mainly more interested in figuring out why the magnets in her house keep falling off her fridge (to the extent that she does not show up to the date that they had planned together) and while investigating the reason behind this, she and Hopper uncover a Russian conspiracy. After infiltrating a Russian lab beneath the new Starcourt Mall, where the Russians have opened another portal into the Upside Down, Joyce is forced to close the portal by turning off the Russian machine used to open it with Hopper in the room, and Hopper ends up being \u201ckilled\u201d. Joyce becomes a mother figure to Eleven after taking her in when Hopper died. The Byers Family and Eleven move out of Hawkins three months after Hopper's death.\n\n===Jim Hopper===\n{{Main|Jim Hopper (Stranger Things)}}\nJim Hopper (portrayed by [[David Harbour]]<ref name=\"RyderHarbour\"/>), nicknamed \"Hop\", is the Hawkins chief of police. Hopper has lived in Hawkins nearly all his life, having attended high school with Joyce and Bob. Hopper divorced after his young daughter Sarah died of cancer, which caused him to lapse into alcoholism. Eventually, he grows to be more responsible, saving Will from the Demogorgon as well as taking Eleven in as his adopted daughter. In Season 3, he tries to break up El and Mike since their relationship is moving too fast for him, while trying to win over Joyce romantically. Through Joyce, he once again gets involved in an investigation regarding the supernatural, which leads them to uncover a Russian conspiracy. He is \"killed\" by an explosion caused by a Russian machine used to open a portal to the Upside Down. In a trailer for the fourth season, he is shown alive in Russia.\n\n===Mike Wheeler===\n{{Main|Mike Wheeler (Stranger Things)}}\nMichael \"Mike\" Wheeler (portrayed by [[Finn Wolfhard]]<ref name=\"YoungCast\">{{cite web |url=https://deadline.com/2015/08/duffer-bros-netflix-series-stranger-things-young-cast-1201502552/ |title=Duffer Bros.

Mike is an intelligent and conscientious student who is committed to his friends. In their ''[[Dungeons and Dragons]]'' party, Mike is their paladin and usually plays the role of Dungeon Master. He develops romantic feelings for Eleven (or El, as Mike and his friends prefer to call her). In Season Two, it is revealed that he has developed a more rebellious streak, likely stemming from missing Eleven. He is the first one Will reveals his apparent flashbacks to the Upside Down to and he accompanies Will, Joyce, and Bob to the lab when Will's health deteriorates. When Eleven reappears, he is joyous, but angry at Hopper for keeping her hidden for the past year. A month later, the two attend the Snow Ball together and share a kiss. The next summer, the two are dating, but Hopper manages to separate them as he thinks they are spending too much time together. With additional meddling from Max, Eleven eventually breaks up with Mike, but the two later get back together. Mike has openly said that he loves Eleven, and nearly confesses to her but struggles to find the right words. When Eleven moves away with the Byers, Mike promises her to keep in contact and schedules visits at Thanksgiving and Christmas. Eleven then tells Mike that she loves him, too.\n\n===Eleven<span id=\"Jane Hopper\"></span><span id=\"Jane Ives\"></span>===\n{{Main|Eleven (Stranger Things)}}\nEleven (portrayed by [[Millie Bobby Brown]]<ref name=\"YoungCast\" />) was born as Jane Ives, daughter of Terry Ives and Andrew Rich (who died in Vietnam), and grew up in Hawkins Lab where she was experimented on by scientists until the beginning of season one. Eleven has telekinetic and telepathic powers, which allow her to control things with her mind. She escaped the lab and befriended Dustin, Will, Mike, and Lucas. In the ''Dungeons and Dragons'' party, she is the mage. In season two, Jim Hopper became a father figure to Eleven while searching for her biological mother, culminating in her adoption by Hopper at the end of the season and was named Jane Hopper. In season three, she is dating Mike, to Hopper's chagrin, and is pursued by the Mind Flayer that had been let loose by the Russians opening a gateway to the Upside Down. After Hopper disappears when the portal is closed, she reads a speech that Hopper wrote to control things between El and Mike but never actually talked to them both about. At the end of season three, she confesses to Mike that she loves him. Joyce takes Eleven in after Hopper \u201cdies\u201d and Eleven leaves Hawkins with the Byers family.\n\n===Dustin Henderson===\n{{Main|Dustin Henderson}}\nDustin Henderson (portrayed by [[Gaten Matarazzo]]),<ref name=\"YoungCast\" /> a friend of Mike, Will and Lucas, is a highly intelligent and studious boy whose [[Cleidocranial dysostosis|cleidocranial dysplasia]] causes him to [[lisp]]. In their ''Dungeons and Dragons'' party, Dustin is the bard and has arguably the most extensive knowledge of the game, particularly the monsters. He had a crush on Nancy Wheeler, while both he and Lucas had feelings for Max in the second season, but Lucas and Max ultimately end up together. He befriends Steve Harrington in the second season, who gives him advice on how to make girls like him. Prior to Season Three, Dustin spends a month at a science camp and, thanks to Steve's advice, he is able to get a girlfriend, Suzie, that he claims is a genius and is \"hotter than [[Phoebe Cates]].\" Dustin's friends are skeptical whether she actually exists as he is unable to get in contact with her over his makeshift radio tower. Dustin instead discovers the coded Russian transmission and goes to Steve with the information instead of his friends due to their skepticism over Suzie. He later proves Suzie's existence when he contacts her for [[Planck's constant]].\n\n===Lucas Sinclair===\nLucas Charles Sinclair (portrayed by [[Caleb McLaughlin]]<ref name=\"YoungCast\" />) is a friend of Mike, Will and Dustin, and older brother to Erica. Lucas is initially wary of Eleven, yet befriends her later on. In Season Two, he becomes a love interest for Max. In their ''Dungeons and Dragons'' party, Lucas is the ranger. He is very skilled with the use of a slingshot, which the party calls \"The Wrist Rocket\"; in the first two seasons, the slingshot is used for comedic effect as a hopeless last-minute defense, but in the third season, is used to actually save the team from danger.\n\n===Nancy Wheeler===\n{{Main|Nancy Wheeler}}\nNancy Wheeler (portrayed by [[Natalia Dyer]]<ref name=\"YoungCast\" />) is the teenage daughter of Karen and Ted, older sister of Mike Wheeler and Holly Wheeler. Nancy is initially something of an outcast at school until popular student Steve Harrington takes an interest in her. Their relationship lasts until the beginning of season two when she starts dating Jonathan Byers after a little help from conspiracy theorist Murray Bauman. She is very proficient with firearms, despite a noticeable lack of training or practice. She has been seen using pistols, revolvers, rifles and shotguns. In the third season, Nancy and Jonathan work as interns at the ''Hawkins Post'', where Nancy is subject to sexist harassment from her male superiors. She and Jonathan are eventually fired for pursuing a story against their editor's wishes, but Nancy continues to investigate the case, which leads her to multiple encounters with the Flayed being controlled by the Mind Flayer from the Upside Down.\n\n===Jonathan Byers===\nJonathan Byers (portrayed by [[Charlie Heaton]]<ref name=\"YoungCast\" />), the older brother of Will Byers and the son of Joyce Byers, is quiet and considered an outsider at school.

They both become interns at the ''Hawkins Post'' in Season 3, but are eventually fired by their editor. He moves out of Hawkins with Joyce, Will, and Eleven at the end of Season 3.\n\n===Karen Wheeler===\nKaren Wheeler (portrayed by [[Cara Buono]]<ref name=\"Buono\">{{cite web |url=https://deadline.com/2015/09/cara-buono-cast-netflix-stranger-things-dean-cain-lady-dynamite-1201511834/ |title=Cara Buono Joins Netflix's 'Stranger Things'; Dean Cain In 'Lady Dynamite' |last=Petski |first=Denise |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |date=September 1, 2015 |accessdate=July 17, 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160726092406/http://deadline.com/2015/09/cara-buono-cast-netflix-stranger-things-dean-cain-lady-dynamite-1201511834/ |archivedate=July 26, 2016}}</ref>) is the mother of Nancy, Mike, and toddler Holly, and wife of Ted. She is a loving mother who remains largely clueless about her children's activities.

She encourages Nancy to continue pursuing a story she was fired for working on against her editor's orders.\n\n===Martin Brenner===\nMartin Brenner (portrayed by [[Matthew Modine]]<ref name=\"Modine\">{{cite web |url=https://www.thewrap.com/netflixs-stranger-things-adds-matthew-modine-to-cast-exclusive/ |title=Netflix's 'Stranger Things' Adds Matthew Modine to Cast (Exclusive) |last=Linda |first=Ge |website=[[TheWrap]] |date=October 27, 2015 |accessdate=July 17, 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160704001518/http://www.thewrap.com/netflixs-stranger-things-adds-matthew-modine-to-cast-exclusive/ |archivedate=July 4, 2016}}</ref>) is the head scientist of Hawkins Laboratory and the experiments performed there. He is a callous and manipulative scientist, having abducted Eleven from her mother, whom he later subjected to electroshock therapy to destroy the woman's mind. Brenner then put Eleven through numerous before (project INDIGO) before she escapes after using her abilities to establish a link to the Upside Down. He and his team hunt for her throughout Hawkins while covering up the actions of the Demogorgon they unknowingly let loose. Brenner is apparently killed by the Demogorgon in the first-season finale, though a former worker named Ray assumed Brenner is still alive during his attempt to plea for his life to Eleven and Kali (eight).\n\n===Will Byers===\nWill Byers (portrayed by [[Noah Schnapp]]<ref name=\"YoungCast\" />), the younger brother of Jonathan Byers and the son of Joyce Byers, is a shy, kind, and often timid boy.

In season three, his friends' preoccupations with their girlfriends leads to Will feeling like the odd-man-out; although it has been suggested multiple times in the show, in season 3 Mike heavily implies that Will could be [[gay]]. His link to the Mind Flayer helps the group detect when it, or one of the Flayed, are active. At the end of the season he moves out of Hawkins with his mother, brother and Eleven.\n\n===Max Mayfield<span id=\"Mad Max\"></span><span id=\"Max Mayfield\"></span>===\nMaxine \"Max\" Mayfield (portrayed by [[Sadie Sink]]) is Billy's younger stepsister, an avid skateboarder, and the [[tomboy]] of the group who catches the attention of both Lucas and Dustin.

Zoomer.\" In season three, she and Lucas are dating, and she and Eleven become close friends. She is also shown to be a fan of Wonder Woman comics.\n\n===Steve Harrington===\n{{Main|Steve Harrington}}\nSteve Harrington (portrayed by [[Joe Keery]]) is a popular student at the high school.

Joyce is a very caring and strong-willed woman who works as a retail clerk at Melvald's General Store in downtown Hawkins. She was born and raised in Hawkins and she attended Hawkins High School with the future chief of police, Jim Hopper, and her Season Two love interest, Bob Newby (who is later unfortunately killed by a demogorgon). In Season Three, she is planning to sell her house and move out of Hawkins, much to the dismay of Hopper who tries to convince her to go on a date with him. Even though she does have feelings for him, Joyce tries to avoid getting in another relationship. She is mainly more interested in figuring out why the magnets in her house keep falling off her fridge (to the extent that she does not show up to the date that they had planned together) and while investigating the reason behind this, she and Hopper uncover a Russian conspiracy. After infiltrating a Russian lab beneath the new Starcourt Mall, where the Russians have opened another portal into the Upside Down, Joyce is forced to close the portal by turning off the Russian machine used to open it with Hopper in the room, and Hopper ends up being \u201ckilled\u201d. Joyce becomes a mother figure to Eleven after taking her in when Hopper died. The Byers Family and Eleven move out of Hawkins three months after Hopper's death.\n\n===Jim Hopper===\n{{Main|Jim Hopper (Stranger Things)}}\nJim Hopper (portrayed by [[David Harbour]]<ref name=\"RyderHarbour\"/>), nicknamed \"Hop\", is the Hawkins chief of police. Hopper has lived in Hawkins nearly all his life, having attended high school with Joyce and Bob. Hopper divorced after his young daughter Sarah died of cancer, which caused him to lapse into alcoholism. Eventually, he grows to be more responsible, saving Will from the Demogorgon as well as taking Eleven in as his adopted daughter. In Season 3, he tries to break up El and Mike since their relationship is moving too fast for him, while trying to win over Joyce romantically. Through Joyce, he once again gets involved in an investigation regarding the supernatural, which leads them to uncover a Russian conspiracy. He is \"killed\" by an explosion caused by a Russian machine used to open a portal to the Upside Down. In a trailer for the fourth season, he is shown alive in Russia.\n\n===Mike Wheeler===\n{{Main|Mike Wheeler (Stranger Things)}}\nMichael \"Mike\" Wheeler (portrayed by [[Finn Wolfhard]]<ref name=\"YoungCast\">{{cite web |url=https://deadline.com/2015/08/duffer-bros-netflix-series-stranger-things-young-cast-1201502552/ |title=Duffer Bros.

Mike is an intelligent and conscientious student who is committed to his friends. In their ''[[Dungeons and Dragons]]'' party, Mike is their paladin and usually plays the role of Dungeon Master. He develops romantic feelings for Eleven (or El, as Mike and his friends prefer to call her). In Season Two, it is revealed that he has developed a more rebellious streak, likely stemming from missing Eleven. He is the first one Will reveals his apparent flashbacks to the Upside Down to and he accompanies Will, Joyce, and Bob to the lab when Will's health deteriorates. When Eleven reappears, he is joyous, but angry at Hopper for keeping her hidden for the past year. A month later, the two attend the Snow Ball together and share a kiss. The next summer, the two are dating, but Hopper manages to separate them as he thinks they are spending too much time together. With additional meddling from Max, Eleven eventually breaks up with Mike, but the two later get back together. Mike has openly said that he loves Eleven, and nearly confesses to her but struggles to find the right words. When Eleven moves away with the Byers, Mike promises her to keep in contact and schedules visits at Thanksgiving and Christmas. Eleven then tells Mike that she loves him, too.\n\n===Eleven<span id=\"Jane Hopper\"></span><span id=\"Jane Ives\"></span>===\n{{Main|Eleven (Stranger Things)}}\nEleven (portrayed by [[Millie Bobby Brown]]<ref name=\"YoungCast\" />) was born as Jane Ives, daughter of Terry Ives and Andrew Rich (who died in Vietnam), and grew up in Hawkins Lab where she was experimented on by scientists until the beginning of season one. Eleven has telekinetic and telepathic powers, which allow her to control things with her mind. She escaped the lab and befriended Dustin, Will, Mike, and Lucas. In the ''Dungeons and Dragons'' party, she is the mage. In season two, Jim Hopper became a father figure to Eleven while searching for her biological mother, culminating in her adoption by Hopper at the end of the season and was named Jane Hopper. In season three, she is dating Mike, to Hopper's chagrin, and is pursued by the Mind Flayer that had been let loose by the Russians opening a gateway to the Upside Down. After Hopper disappears when the portal is closed, she reads a speech that Hopper wrote to control things between El and Mike but never actually talked to them both about. At the end of season three, she confesses to Mike that she loves him. Joyce takes Eleven in after Hopper \u201cdies\u201d and Eleven leaves Hawkins with the Byers family.\n\n===Dustin Henderson===\n{{Main|Dustin Henderson}}\nDustin Henderson (portrayed by [[Gaten Matarazzo]a friend of Mike, Will and Lucas, is a highly intelligent and studious boy whose [[Cleidocranial dysostosis|cleidocranial dysplasia]] causes him to [[lisp]]. In their ''Dungeons and Dragons'' party, Dustin is the bard and has arguably the most extensive knowledge of the game, particularly the monsters. He had a crush on Nancy Wheeler, while both he and Lucas had feelings for Max in the second season, but Lucas and Max ultimately end up together. He befriends Steve Harrington in the second season, who gives him advice on how to make girls like him. Prior to Season Three, Dustin spends a month at a science camp and, thanks to Steve's advice, he is able to get a girlfriend, Suzie, that he claims is a genius and is \"hotter than [[Phoebe Cates]].\" Dustin's friends are skeptical whether she actually exists as he is unable to get in contact with her over his makeshift radio tower. Dustin instead discovers the coded Russian transmission and goes to Steve with the information instead of his friends due to their skepticism over Suzie. He later proves Suzie's existence when he contacts her for [[Planck's constant]].\n\n===Lucas Sinclair===\nLucas Charles Sinclair (portrayed by [[Caleb McLaughlin]]<ref name=\"YoungCast\" />) is a friend of Mike, Will and Dustin, and older brother to Erica. Lucas is initially wary of Eleven, yet befriends her later on. In Season Two, he becomes a love interest for Max. In their ''Dungeons and Dragons'' party, Lucas is the ranger. He is very skilled with the use of a slingshot, which the party calls \"The Wrist Rocket\"; in the first two seasons, the slingshot is used for comedic effect as a hopeless last-minute defense, but in the third season, is used to actually save the team from danger.\n\n===Nancy Wheeler===\n{{Main|Nancy Wheeler}}\nNancy Wheeler (portrayed by [[Natalia Dyer]]<ref name=\"YoungCast\" />) is the teenage daughter of Karen and Ted, older sister of Mike Wheeler and Holly Wheeler. Nancy is initially something of an outcast at school until popular student Steve Harrington takes an interest in her. Their relationship lasts until the beginning of season two when she starts dating Jonathan Byers after a little help from conspiracy theorist Murray Bauman. She is very proficient with firearms, despite a noticeable lack of training or practice. She has been seen using pistols, revolvers, rifles and shotguns. In the third season, Nancy and Jonathan work as interns at the ''Hawkins Post'', where Nancy is subject to sexist harassment from her male superiors. She and Jonathan are eventually fired for pursuing a story against their editor's wishes, but Nancy continues to investigate the case, which leads her to multiple encounters with the Flayed being controlled by the Mind Flayer from the Upside Down.\n\n===Jonathan Byers===\nJonathan Byers (portrayed by [[Charlie Heaton]]<ref name=\"YoungCast\" />), the older brother of Will Byers and the son of Joyce Byers, is quiet and considered an outsider at school. He is an aspiring photographer, and very close with his mother and brother. He starts dating Nancy at the end of Season 2. They both become interns at the ''Hawkins Post'' in Season 3, but are eventually fired by their editor. He moves out of Hawkins with Joyce, Will, and Eleven at the end of Season 3.\n\n===Karen Wheeler===\nKaren Wheeler (portrayed by [[Cara Buono]]<ref name=\"Buono\">{{cite web |url=https://deadline.com/2015/09/cara-buono-cast-netflix-stranger-things-dean-cain-lady-dynamite-1201511834/ |title=Cara Buono Joins Netflix's 'Stranger Things'; Dean Cain In 'Lady Dynamite' |last=Petski |first=Denise |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |date=September 1, 2015 |accessdate=July 17, 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160726092406/http://deadline.com/2015/09/cara-buono-cast-netflix-stranger-things-dean-cain-lady-dynamite-1201511834/ |archivedate=July 26, 2016}}</ref>) is the mother of Nancy, Mike, and toddler Holly, and wife of Ted. She is a loving mother who remains largely clueless about her children's activities.

[[Immunodeficiency|Immunocompromised]] people are also at higher risk. Pontiac fever most commonly occurs in those who are otherwise healthy.\n\nThe most useful diagnostic tests detect the bacteria in [[sputum|coughed-up mucus]], find ''Legionella'' antigens in urine samples, or allow comparison of ''Legionella'' antibody levels in two blood samples taken 3\u20136 weeks apart. A urine antigen test is simple, quick, and very reliable, but only detects ''L. pneumophila'' serogroup 1, which accounts for 70% of disease caused by ''L. pneumophila'', which means use of the urine antigen test alone may miss as many as 30% of cases.<ref name=\"FieldsBenson2002\">{{cite journal |last1=Fields |first1=B.

However, it does not identify the specific subtypes, so it cannot be used to match the person with the environmental source of infection. The ''Legionella'' bacteria can be cultured from sputum or other respiratory samples. ''Legionella'' spp. stain poorly with Gram stain, stains positive with silver, and is cultured on charcoal yeast extract with iron and cysteine ([[CYE agar]]).\n\nA significant under-reporting problem occurs with legionellosis. Even in countries with effective health services and readily available diagnostic testing, about 90% of cases of Legionnaires' disease are missed. This is partly due to the disease being a relatively rare form of pneumonia, which many clinicians may not have encountered before, thus may misdiagnose. A further issue is that people with legionellosis can present with a wide range of symptoms, some of which (such as diarrhea) may distract clinicians from making a correct diagnosis.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Makin, T |title=Legionella bacteria and solar pre-heating of water for domestic purposes |journal=UK Water Regulations Advisory Scheme Report |page=4 |date=January 2008 |url=http://www.wras.co.uk/PDF_Files/Preheated_Water_Report.pdf |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305211608/https://www.wras.co.uk/PDF_Files/Preheated_Water_Report.pdf |archivedate=2016-03-05 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Prevention==\nAlthough the risk of Legionnaires' disease being spread by large-scale water systems cannot be eliminated, it can be greatly reduced by writing and enforcing a highly detailed, systematic [[water safety plan]] appropriate for the specific  facility involved (office building, hospital, hotel, spa, cruise ship, etc.)<ref name=\"WHO 2007\"/> Some of the elements that such a plan may include are:\n* Keep water temperature either above or below the {{convert|20|-|50|C}} range in which the ''Legionella'' bacterium thrives.\n* Prevent [[Water stagnation|stagnation]], for example, by removing from a network of pipes any sections that have no outlet (dead ends). Where stagnation is unavoidable, as when a wing of a hotel is closed for the off-season, systems must be thoroughly disinfected just prior to resuming normal operation.\n* Prevent the buildup of [[biofilm]], for example, by not using (or by replacing) construction materials that encourage its development, and by reducing the quantity of nutrients for bacterial growth that enter the system.\n* Periodically disinfect the system, by high heat or a chemical [[biocide]], and use [[Water chlorination|chlorination]] where appropriate. Treatment of water with [[copper-silver ionization]] or [[ultraviolet light]] may also be effective.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Almeida D, Cristovam E, Caldeira D, Ferreira JJ, Marques T  |title=Are there effective interventions to prevent hospital-acquired Legionnaires' disease or to reduce environmental reservoirs of Legionella in hospitals?

Current treatments of choice are the respiratory tract quinolones ([[levofloxacin]], [[moxifloxacin]], [[gemifloxacin]]) or newer macrolides ([[azithromycin]], [[clarithromycin]], [[roxithromycin]]). The antibiotics used most frequently have been levofloxacin, [[doxycycline]], and azithromycin.\n\nMacrolides (azithromycin) are used in all age groups, while tetracyclines (doxycycline) are prescribed for children above the age of 12 and quinolones (levofloxacin) above the age of 18. [[Rifampicin]] can be used in combination with a quinolone or macrolide. Whether rifampicin is an effective antibiotic to take for treatment is uncertain. The [[Infectious Diseases Society of America]] does not recommend the use of rifampicin with added regimens. Tetracyclines and [[erythromycin]] led to improved outcomes compared to other antibiotics in the original American Legion outbreak. These antibiotics are effective because they have excellent intracellular penetration in ''Legionella''-infected cells. The recommended treatment is 5\u201310 days of levofloxacin or 3\u20135 days of azithromycin, but in people who are immunocompromised, have severe disease, or other pre-existing health conditions, longer antibiotic use may be necessary.<ref name=\"pmid26231463\"/> During outbreaks, prophylactic antibiotics have been used to prevent Legionnaires' disease in high-risk individuals who have possibly been exposed.<ref name=\"pmid26231463\"/>\n\nThe mortality at the original American Legion convention in 1976 was high (29 deaths in 182 infected individuals<ref name=Winn1988>{{cite journal |vauthors=Winn WC |title=Legionnaires disease: Historical perspective |journal=Clinical Microbiology Reviews |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=60\u201381 |year=1988 |pmid=3060246 |pmc=358030 |doi=10.1128/cmr.1.1.60}}</ref>) because the antibiotics used (including [[penicillin]]s, [[cephalosporin]]s, and [[aminoglycoside]]s) had poor intracellular penetration.

However, it does not identify the specific subtypes, so it cannot be used to match the person with the environmental source of infection. The ''Legionella'' bacteria can be cultured from sputum or other respiratory samples. ''Legionella'' spp. stain poorly with Gram stain, stains positive with silver, and is cultured on charcoal yeast extract with iron and cysteine ([[CYE agar]]).\n\nA significant under-reporting problem occurs with legionellosis. Even in countries with effective health services and readily available diagnostic testing, about 90% of cases of Legionnaires' disease are missed. This is partly due to the disease being a relatively rare form of pneumonia, which many clinicians may not have encountered before, thus may misdiagnose. A further issue is that people with legionellosis can present with a wide range of symptoms, some of which (such as diarrhea) may distract clinicians from making a correct diagnosis.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Makin, T |title=Legionella bacteria and solar pre-heating of water for domestic purposes |journal=UK Water Regulations Advisory Scheme Report |page=4 |date=January 2008 |url=http://www.wras.co.uk/PDF_Files/Preheated_Water_Report.pdf |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305211608/https://www.wras.co.uk/PDF_Files/Preheated_Water_Report.pdf |archivedate=2016-03-05 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Prevention==\nAlthough the risk of Legionnaires' disease being spread by large-scale water systems cannot be eliminated, it can be greatly reduced by writing and enforcing a highly detailed, systematic [[water safety plan]] appropriate for the specific  facility involved (office building, hospital, hotel, spa, cruise ship, etc.)<ref name=\"WHO 2007\"/> Some of the elements that such a plan may include are:\n* Keep water temperature either above or below the {{convert|20|-|50|C}} range in which the ''Legionella'' bacterium thrives.\n* Prevent [[Water stagnation|stagnation]], for example, by removing from a network of pipes any sections that have no outlet (dead ends). Where stagnation is unavoidable, as when a wing of a hotel is closed for the off-season, systems must be thoroughly disinfected just prior to resuming normal operation.\n* Prevent the buildup of [[biofilm]], for example, by not using (or by replacing) construction materials that encourage its development, and by reducing the quantity of nutrients for bacterial growth that enter the system.\n* Periodically disinfect the system, by high heat or a chemical [[biocide]], and use [[Water chlorination|chlorination]] where appropriate.

Current treatments of choice are the respiratory tract quinolones ([[levofloxacin]], [[moxifloxacin]], [[gemifloxacin]]) or newer macrolides ([[azithromycin]], [[clarithromycin]], [[roxithromycin]]). The antibiotics used most frequently have been levofloxacin, [[doxycycline]], and azithromycin.\n\nMacrolides (azithromycin) are used in all age groups, while tetracyclines (doxycycline) are prescribed for children above the age of 12 and quinolones (levofloxacin) above the age of 18. [[Rifampicin]] can be used in combination with a quinolone or macrolide. Whether rifampicin is an effective antibiotic to take for treatment is uncertain. The [[Infectious Diseases Society of America]] does not recommend the use of rifampicin with added regimens. Tetracyclines and [[erythromycin]] led to improved outcomes compared to other antibiotics in the original American Legion outbreak. These antibiotics are effective because they have excellent intracellular penetration in ''Legionella''-infected cells.

Subdistrict]] on the north coast of [[East Timor]], 152&nbsp;km to the west of [[Dili]], the nation's capital. It has a population of 4,730 (Stand 2006). It is the capital of the [[Oecusse District|Oecusse]] [[exclave]] (former Oecussi-Ambeno).\n\nThe name literally means \"beach of Makassar,\" alluding to the erstwhile trade with [[Makasar|Makassar]] in [[Sulawesi]] (Celebes). Locally Pante Macassar is known also as \"Oecussi,\" which literally means \"water cannon,\" and was the name of one of the two original kingdoms that form the enclave. The other was [[Ambeno]]. During the Portuguese colonisation, the city was also known as ''Vila Taveiro.''\n\n[[Lifau]], in the outskirts of the present city, was the place where the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] first disembarked on [[Timor]] and was the first capital of [[Portuguese Timor]]. It remained the capital until 1769, when it was transferred to [[Dili]] because of constant attacks from the ''Topasses''.\n\nDue to its distance from the remainder of [[East Timor]], Oecussi-Ambeno, and specifically Pante Macassar, became the first territory occupied by [[Indonesia]] on November 29, 1975.\n\nIn 1999, in the tumult that accompanied the referendum for independence, Pante Macassar was particularly affected by the destructiveness of the pro-integration militias, supported by the Indonesian army. Sixty-five civilian supporters of independence were hanged, and 90 percent of the buildings were burned down.\n\nToday, the city has only a few dozen houses next to a beach with crystal-clear water, surrounded by palms. Crime is practically unknown. The only radio station works only occasionally due to an old transmitter, and electricity is limited to five hours at night. Twice a week, the isolation is briefly interrupted when a ferry boat from [[Dili]] arrives, for a journey that takes 12 hours.\n\n==References==\n*
