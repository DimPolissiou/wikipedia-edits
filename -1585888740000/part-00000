Brown is perhaps best known for her work in the 1980s, where she often played a quintessential [[valley girl]] character. Much of her comedy has revolved around the mocking of famous people (with a strong and frequently revisited focus on [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]).\n\n==Career==\nJulie Brown began her career performing in nightclubs.<ref name=TI>{{cite web|title=Julie Brown|publisher=[[The Improv]]|url=http://improv.com/comedian.cfm?id=7551|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161018203119/http://improv.com/comedian.cfm?id=7551|archivedate=2016-10-18}}</ref>  She started working on television with a guest spot on the sitcom ''[[Happy Days]]''. She also appeared in the 1981 cult film ''[[Bloody Birthday]]''. After a small role in the [[Clint Eastwood]] comedy film ''[[Any Which Way You Can]]'', comedian [[Lily Tomlin]] saw Brown at a [[comedy club]] and gave her her first big break, a part in her [[1981 in film|1981 film]] ''[[The Incredible Shrinking Woman]]''.<ref name=TI/> Tomlin and Brown eventually became close friends. A string of guest starring appearances in a variety of television shows followed, including: ''[[Laverne & Shirley]]'', ''[[Buffalo Bill (TV series)|Buffalo Bill]]'', ''[[The Jeffersons]]'' and ''[[Newhart]]''.  Brown also appeared in short films such as \"Five Minutes, Miss Brown\".<ref>{{cite video|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HM05GRSvC8|publisher=[[YouTube]]|title=Five Minutes, Miss Brown}}</ref>\n\nIn 1984, she released her first [[Extended play|EP]], a five-song album called ''[[Goddess in Progress]]''.<ref name=LT>{{cite web|work=[[The Los Angeles Times]]|title=Valley Girl Is Only One Shade of Julie Brown|date=February 8, 1990|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-02-08/entertainment/ca-387_1_julie-brown}}</ref> The album, parodies of popular '80s music combined with her valley girl personality, was quickly discovered by the [[Dr. Demento]] Show. The songs \"[[Earth Girls Are Easy (Soundtrack)|'Cause I'm a Blonde]]\" and \"[[The Homecoming Queen's Got a Gun]]\" were given radio airplay across the world. The latter was a spoof on stereotypical 1950s' [[teen tragedy song]]s, with [[Cheerleading|cheerleader]]s' heads and [[pompon|pompoms]] being blown to pieces.\n\nIn 1987, Brown released her first full-length album, ''[[Trapped in the Body of a White Girl]]''.<ref>{{cite web |work=[[People (magazine)|People]] |date=November 2, 1987 |title=Picks and Pans Review: Trapped in the Body of a White Girl Vol. 28 No. 18 |url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20097470,00.html}}</ref> The album highlighted her comedic talent and [[valley girl]] personality. The album's highlights were \"[[I Like 'em Big and Stupid]]\" and she reprised \"[[The Homecoming Queen's Got a Gun]]\". (The album was reissued on CD in 2010 by Collector's Choice Music on its Noble Rot label.)<ref>{{YouTube|b8hxCpAdCJI|''The Homecoming Queen's Got a Gun''}}</ref> [[Music video]]s were recorded and received heavy airplay on [[MTV]]. In 1989, Brown starred in that cable network's comedy and music-video show ''[[Just Say Julie]]''.<ref name=LT/> She played the role of a demanding, controlling, and pessimistic glamour-puss from the valley, making fun of popular music acts while at the same time introducing their music videos. (She was also known as \"Miss Julie Brown\" at the time to differentiate her from [[Downtown Julie Brown]], who was on the network at the same time.)\n\nBrown's film career began in 1988 with the release of the film ''[[Earth Girls Are Easy]]'', written, [[film producer|produced]] by, and starring Brown,<ref>{{cite web|title=Earth Girls Are Easy (1989) Review/Film; On Shaving, Furry Aliens Turn Into Valley Guys|first=Caryn|last=James|date=May 12, 1989|work=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=950DEFD6163DF931A25756C0A96F948260}}</ref> it was based loosely on a song by the same name from her debut EP. The film also starred [[Jeff Goldblum]] and [[Geena Davis]]. Brown cast then-unknown comedians [[Jim Carrey]] and [[Damon Wayans]]. In 1990 Brown had a brief part in the movie ''[[The Spirit of '76 (1990 film)|The Spirit of '76]]'', as an intellectual stripper.\n\n[[Image:Julie Brown 2 by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|left|Brown performing in 2008 at [[The Public Theater]] in [[New York City]].]]\n[[NBC]] commissioned a half-hour [[television pilot|pilot]], ultimately unsold and airing Sunday, July 28, 1991, at 7 p.m. [[North American Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time]], titled ''The Julie Show''. Created by Brown, [[Charlie Coffey (writer)|Charlie Coffey]], and [[television director|director]] and [[executive producer]] [[David Mirkin]], it was a comedy about actress Julie Robbins (Brown), who in this initial story, goes to great lengths to land an interview with teen singer Kiki (played by Kim Walker) in the hopes of getting hired as a tabloid-TV celebrity journalist. Developed under the working title ''The Julie Brown Show'', it also starred [[Marian Mercer]] as Julie's mother, June; [[DeLane Matthews]] as Debra Deacon, a reporter on the fictional series ''Inside Scoop''; [[Susan Messing]] as Julie's roommate Cheryl; and [[Kevin O'Rourke]] as ''Inside Scoop'' producer Tony Barnow. Brown was also a producer, with John Ziffren, and performed and co-wrote the [[theme song]]. Walker, Don Sparks, Robin Angers, and Deborah Driggs were guest performers in this production from Mirkinvision and [[New World Communications|New World Television]].<ref>[[Frank Lovece|Lovece, Frank]]. ''The Television Yearbook 1990-91'' (Perigee Books / Putnam Publishing, 1991), p. 267</ref>\n\nAnother pilot was filmed for CBS, ''Julie Brown: The Show'', and featured a similar theme, in which Brown was the hostess of a talk show and she would interview actual celebrity guests, interspersed with scripted scenarios. The pilot was aired but the show was not picked up; years later it leaked onto the Internet.\n\nIn 1992, Brown starred in her own [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] [[sketch comedy]] show, ''[[The Edge (TV series)|The Edge]]''; two of its regulars, [[Jennifer Aniston]] and [[Wayne Knight]], later became sitcom stars, while [[Tom Kenny]] went on to voice ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]''.

(Brown's co-star was [[Kathy Griffin]].)\n\nBrown followed with another satire, ''[[Attack of the 5 Ft. 2 In. Women|Attack of the 5 Ft. 2 Women]]'', which lampooned the violence of [[ice skater]] [[Tonya Harding]] toward rival [[Nancy Kerrigan]], as well as that of widely publicized [[castration|castrator]] [[John and Lorena Bobbitt|Lorena Bobbitt]].<ref>{{Citation|last=Brown|first=Julie|title=Attack of the 5 Ft. 2 Women|date=1994-08-21|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109167/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_45|last2=Wenk|first2=Richard|accessdate=2016-10-11}}</ref>\n\nShe has continued to make television guest appearances and contributed voices to various [[cartoon]]s, including ''[[Animaniacs]]'' (as the voice of Minerva Mink),'' '' ''[[Aladdin (TV series)|Aladdin]]'' as bratty [[mermaid]] Saleen, and as the original voice of [[Zatanna]] in the ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' cartoon. Prior to this she also guest starred on a ''[[Tiny Toon Adventures]]'' episode as Julie Bruin, a cartoon bear version of herself, in which she guest starred in her own segment ''Just Say Julie Bruin'', a reference to her music video show. The ''Just Say Julie Bruin'' cartoon also was a music video show and in her segment [[Elmer Fudd]] guest starred as Fuddonna, parody of Madonna and a reference to Julie Brown herself regularly mocking her.\n\nBrown appeared as Coach Millie Stoeger in the film ''[[Clueless (film)|Clueless]]'', reprising that role on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC's]] 1996-1999 [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] TV series, for which she was also a writer, producer and director. Two regulars from the series, [[Donald Faison]] and [[Elisa Donovan]], later found similarly successful roles, as would featured player [[Christina Milian]] who had a recurring role on the series during its [[UPN]] years.  In 1998, Brown appeared in the parody movie ''[[Plump Fiction]]''. In 2000, she created the series ''[[Strip Mall]]'' for the [[Comedy Central]] network; it ran two seasons.\n\nSince 2004, Brown has been a commentator on [[E!]] network specials, including ''101 Reasons the '90s Ruled'', ''101 Most Starlicious Makeovers'', ''101 Most Awesome Moments in Entertainment'', and ''50 Most Outrageous TV Moments''.\n\nIn 2005, Brown purchased the rights to her ''Trapped'' album back from the record label and reissued it herself.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} She also self-released a single, \"[[I Want to Be Gay]]\". In late 2007, she also purchased the rights to her 1984 E.P.

Brown also joined the cast of the Canadian television series, ''[[Paradise Falls]]'', that same year.\n\nIn late 2008 Brown began releasing one-track digital singles, starting with [https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/the-ex-beauty-queens-got-a-gun/id295395743 \"The Ex-Beauty Queen's Got a Gun\"]; it was a rewrite of \"Homecoming Queen\" with lyrics about [[Sarah Palin]]. This was first aired in September, 2008 on ''[[Stephanie Miller Show|The Stephanie Miller Show]].'' In 2011 she released an album ''Smell The Glamour'', which features satires of [[Lady Gaga]], [[Kesha]] and updated versions of her ''Medusa'' songs.\n\nIn the 2010-2011 television season, Brown began a recurring role as Paula Norwood, a neighbor and friend of the Heck family, on the ABC comedy ''[[The Middle (TV series)|The Middle]]''. From 2010 to 2015 she was a writer for ''[[Melissa & Joey]]'', and played a gym teacher in one episode of the show.

Brown is perhaps best known for her work in the 1980s, where she often played a quintessential [[valley girl]] character. Much of her comedy has revolved around the mocking of famous people (with a strong and frequently revisited focus on [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]).\n\n==Career==\nJulie Brown began her career performing in nightclubs.<ref name=TI>{{cite web|title=Julie Brown|publisher=[[The Improv]]|url=http://improv.com/comedian.cfm?id=7551|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161018203119/http://improv.com/comedian.cfm?id=7551|archivedate=2016-10-18}}</ref>  She started working on television with a guest spot on the sitcom ''[[Happy Days]]''. She also appeared in the 1981 cult film ''[[Bloody Birthday]]''. After a small role in the [[Clint Eastwood]] comedy film ''[[Any Which Way You Can]]'', comedian [[Lily Tomlin]] saw Brown at a [[comedy club]] and gave her her first big break, a part in her [[1981 in film|1981 film]] ''[[The Incredible Shrinking Woman]]''.<ref name=TI/> Tomlin and Brown eventually became close friends. A string of guest starring appearances in a variety of television shows followed, including: ''[[Laverne & Shirley]]'', ''[[Buffalo Bill (TV series)|Buffalo Bill]]'', ''[[The Jeffersons]]'' and ''[[Newhart]]''.  Brown also appeared in short films such as \"Five Minutes, Miss Brown\".<ref>{{cite video|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HM05GRSvC8|publisher=[[YouTube]]|title=Five Minutes, Miss Brown}}</ref>\n\nIn 1984, she released her first [[Extended play|EP]], a five-song album called ''[[Goddess in Progress]]''.<ref name=LT>{{cite web|work=[[The Los Angeles Times]]|title=Valley Girl Is Only One Shade of Julie Brown|date=February 8, 1990|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-02-08/entertainment/ca-387_1_julie-brown}}</ref> The album, parodies of popular '80s music combined with her valley girl personality, was quickly discovered by the [[Dr. Demento]] Show. The songs \"[[Earth Girls Are Easy (Soundtrack)|'Cause I'm a Blonde]]\" and \"[[The Homecoming Queen's Got a Gun]]\" were given radio airplay across the world. The latter was a spoof on stereotypical 1950s' [[teen tragedy song]]s, with [[Cheerleading|cheerleader]]s' heads and [[pompon|pompoms]] being blown to pieces.\n\nIn 1987, Brown released her first full-length album, ''[[Trapped in the Body of a White Girl]]''.<ref>{{cite web |work=[[People (magazine)|People]] |date=November 2, 1987 |title=Picks and Pans Review: Trapped in the Body of a White Girl Vol. 28 No. 18 |url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20097470,00.html}}</ref> The album highlighted her comedic talent and [[valley girl]] personality. The album's highlights were \"[[I Like 'em Big and Stupid]]\" and she reprised \"[[The Homecoming Queen's Got a Gun]]\". (The album was reissued on CD in 2010 by Collector's Choice Music on its Noble Rot label.)<ref>{{YouTube|b8hxCpAdCJI|''The Homecoming Queen's Got a Gun''}}</ref> [[Music video]]s were recorded and received heavy airplay on [[MTV]]. In 1989, Brown starred in that cable network's comedy and music-video show ''[[Just Say Julie]]''.<ref name=LT/> She played the role of a demanding, controlling, and pessimistic glamour-puss from the valley, making fun of popular music acts while at the same time introducing their music videos. (She was also known as \"Miss Julie Brown\" at the time to differentiate her from [[Downtown Julie Brown]], who was on the network at the same time.)\n\nBrown's film career began in 1988 with the release of the film ''[[Earth Girls Are Easy]]'', written, [[film producer|produced]] by, and starring Brown,<ref>{{cite web|title=Earth Girls Are Easy (1989) Review/Film; On Shaving, Furry Aliens Turn Into Valley Guys|first=Caryn|last=James|date=May 12, 1989|work=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=950DEFD6163DF931A25756C0A96F948260}}</ref> it was based loosely on a song by the same name from her debut EP. The film also starred [[Jeff Goldblum]] and [[Geena Davis]]. Brown cast then-unknown comedians [[Jim Carrey]] and [[Damon Wayans]]. In 1990 Brown had a brief part in the movie ''[[The Spirit of '76 (1990 film)|The Spirit of '76]]'', as an intellectual stripper.\n\n[[Image:Julie Brown 2 by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|left|Brown performing in 2008 at [[The Public Theater]] in [[New York City]].]]\n[[NBC]] commissioned a half-hour [[television pilot|pilot]], ultimately unsold and airing Sunday, July 28, 1991, at 7 p.m. [[North American Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time]], titled ''The Julie Show''. Created by Brown, [[Charlie Coffey (writer)|Charlie Coffey]], and [[television director|director]] and [[executive producer]] [[David Mirkin]], it was a comedy about actress Julie Robbins (Brown), who in this initial story, goes to great lengths to land an interview with teen singer Kiki (played by Kim Walker) in the hopes of getting hired as a tabloid-TV celebrity journalist. Developed under the working title ''The Julie Brown Show'', it also starred [[Marian Mercer]] as Julie's mother, June; [[DeLane Matthews]] as Debra Deacon, a reporter on the fictional series ''Inside Scoop''; [[Susan Messing]] as Julie's roommate Cheryl; and [[Kevin O'Rourke]] as ''Inside Scoop'' producer Tony Barnow. Brown was also a producer, with John Ziffren, and performed and co-wrote the [[theme song]]. Walker, Don Sparks, Robin Angers, and Deborah Driggs were guest performers in this production from Mirkinvision and [[New World Communications|New World Television]].<ref>[[Frank Lovece|Lovece, Frank]]. ''The Television Yearbook 1990-91'' (Perigee Books / Putnam Publishing, 1991), p. 267</ref>\n\nAnother pilot was filmed for CBS, ''Julie Brown: The Show'', and featured a similar theme, in which Brown was the hostess of a talk show and she would interview actual celebrity guests, interspersed with scripted scenarios. The pilot was aired but the show was not picked up; years later it leaked onto the Internet.\n\nIn 1992, Brown starred in her own [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] [[sketch comedy]] show, ''[[The Edge (TV series)|The Edge]]''; two of its regulars, [[Jennifer Aniston]] and [[Wayne Knight]], later became sitcom stars, while [[Tom Kenny]] went on to voice ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]''.

(Brown's co-star was [[Kathy Griffin]].)\n\nBrown followed with another satire, ''[[Attack of the 5 Ft. 2 In. Women|Attack of the 5 Ft. 2 Women]]'', which lampooned the violence of [[ice skater]] [[Tonya Harding]] toward rival [[Nancy Kerrigan]], as well as that of widely publicized [[castration|castrator]] [[John and Lorena Bobbitt|Lorena Bobbitt]].<ref>{{Citation|last=Brown|first=Julie|title=Attack of the 5 Ft. 2 Women|date=1994-08-21|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109167/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_45|last2=Wenk|first2=Richard|accessdate=2016-10-11}}</ref>\n\nShe has continued to make television guest appearances and contributed voices to various [[cartoon]]s, including ''[[Animaniacs]]'' (as the voice of Minerva Mink),'' '' ''[[Aladdin (TV series)|Aladdin]]'' as bratty [[mermaid]] Saleen, and as the original voice of [[Zatanna]] in the ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' cartoon. Prior to this she also guest starred on a ''[[Tiny Toon Adventures]]'' episode as Julie Bruin, a cartoon bear version of herself, in which she guest starred in her own segment ''Just Say Julie Bruin'', a reference to her music video show. The ''Just Say Julie Bruin'' cartoon also was a music video show and in her segment [[Elmer Fudd]] guest starred as Fuddonna, parody of Madonna and a reference to Julie Brown herself regularly mocking her.\n\nBrown appeared as Coach Millie Stoeger in the film ''[[Clueless (film)|Clueless]]'', reprising that role on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC's]] 1996-1999 [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] TV series, for which she was also a writer, producer and director. Two regulars from the series, [[Donald Faison]] and [[Elisa Donovan]], later found similarly successful roles, as would featured player [[Christina Milian]] who had a recurring role on the series during its [[UPN]] years.  In 1998, Brown appeared in the parody movie ''[[Plump Fiction]]''. In 2000, she created the series ''[[Strip Mall]]'' for the [[Comedy Central]] network; it ran two seasons.\n\nSince 2004, Brown has been a commentator on [[E!]] network specials, including ''101 Reasons the '90s Ruled'', ''101 Most Starlicious Makeovers'', ''101 Most Awesome Moments in Entertainment'', and ''50 Most Outrageous TV Moments''.\n\nIn 2005, Brown purchased the rights to her ''Trapped'' album back from the record label and reissued it herself.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} She also self-released a single, \"[[I Want to Be Gay]]\". In late 2007, she also purchased the rights to her 1984 E.P.

Brown also joined the cast of the Canadian television series, ''[[Paradise Falls]]'', that same year.\n\nIn late 2008 Brown began releasing one-track digital singles, starting with [https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/the-ex-beauty-queens-got-a-gun/id295395743 \"The Ex-Beauty Queen's Got a Gun\"]; it was a rewrite of \"Homecoming Queen\" with lyrics about [[Sarah Palin]]. This was first aired in September, 2008 on ''[[Stephanie Miller Show|The Stephanie Miller Show]].'' In 2011 she released an album ''Smell The Glamour'', which features satires of [[Lady Gaga]], [[Kesha]] and updated versions of her ''Medusa'' songs.\n\nIn the 2010-2011 television season, Brown began a recurring role as Paula Norwood, a neighbor and friend of the Heck family, on the ABC comedy ''[[The Middle (TV series)|The Middle]]''. From 2010 to 2015 she was a writer for ''[[Melissa & Joey]]'', and played a gym teacher in one episode of the show.
