Polanski's first feature film, it features three characters in a story of rivalry and sexual tension.\n\n''Knife in the Water'' has garnered acclaim from film critics since its release, and is one of Polanski's best-reviewed works.\n\n==Plot==\nAndrzej ([[Leon Niemczyk]]) and Krystyna (Jolanta Umecka) are driving to a lake to go sailing when they come upon a young man ([[Zygmunt Malanowicz]]) hitchhiking in the middle of the road. After nearly hitting him, Andrzej invites the young man along. When they arrive at the lake, instead of leaving the young man behind, Andrzej invites him to go sailing with them. The young man accepts the offer, and, not knowing much about sailing, must learn many hard lessons from Andrzej.\n\nMeanwhile, tension gradually builds between Andrzej and the hitchhiker as they vie for the attentions of Krystyna. The title refers to the major turning point in the film when Andrzej taunts the young man with the latter's treasured pocket knife, which is accidentally lost overboard. A fight ensues between Andrzej and the hitchhiker and the latter falls into the water. Andrzej and his wife search for him, but cannot find him and assume that he has drowned, since earlier he said that he could not swim. Andrzej and his wife quarrel about what to do, and Andrzej swims to shore to fetch the police. When the young man realizes that Andrzej has gone he comes out from hiding behind a buoy on the lake and swims to the yacht. There he sees Krystyna naked drying off. He boards the yacht and Krystyna tells him he is as bad as Andrzej but sexual attraction wins out and they have sex, off screen. Krystyna sails back to the dock, the man jumps off and goes on his way before Andrzej appears and takes charge again. He wants to go to the police to report the young man missing. Krystyna tells him that the young man returned and she was unfaithful. Andrzej does not know what to believe and at the road junction the car does not move.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Leon Niemczyk]] as Andrzej\n* [[Jolanta Umecka]] as Krystyna\n* [[Zygmunt Malanowicz]] as Young Boy\n\n==Production==\n''Knife in the Water'' was shot by Roman Polanski in 1961 using only three actors. It marked Polanski's debut as a feature-length director. Two of the actors (Jolanta Umecka, who plays Krystyna and Zygmunt Malanowicz, who plays the young man) had virtually no previous professional acting experience. [[Krzysztof Komeda]] composed the film's music and the featured saxophonist was [[Bernt Rosengren]].\n\nBeing filmed on the water (in the [[Poland|Polish]] Lake District ''[[Masuria]]''), and largely within the confines of a sailboat and liferaft, the film was technically difficult. While the sailboat was large enough for the three actors, it was quite cramped for the film crew, who often had to hang over the side of the boat with safety harnesses in order to shoot.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.criterion.com/current/posts/901-knife-in-the-water|title=Knife in the Water|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Critical reception==\n''Knife in the Water'' was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]] at the [[36th Academy Awards|1963 Academy Awards]],<ref name=\"Oscars1964\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1964 |title=The 36th Academy Awards (1964) Nominees and Winners |accessdate=2011-11-03|work=oscars.org}}</ref> the first Polish motion picture to receive this kind of recognition.

The squadron finally received some British [[Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5]]s, mostly armed with a single fuselage-mounted Vickers machine gun, and flew two missions in November 1918 days before the war ended.  The first patrol was uneventful and the other patrol targeted a truck convoy in [[Metz]] with 20 lb bombs hand-dropped from their S.E. 5a aircraft. The unit returned to the United States in the spring of 1919 and was [[demobilized]] in June.\n\n===Defense of the Panama Canal===\n[[File:25th Bombardment Squadron Keystone Bomber.jpg|thumb|Squadron Keystone LB-6 in Panama, 1933]]\nThe '''25th Squadron''' (Bombardment) was organized on 1 October 1921 at [[Mitchel Field]], New York, although it is not clear whether it was equipped before moving to [[France Field]] in the [[Panama Canal Zone]] in April 1922, where the [[Panama Canal Department]] assigned it to the [[6th Composite Group]].<ref name=Conaway>{{cite web|url= http://www.planesandpilotsofww2.totalh.net/panama/25thbshistorytem.htm |last1=Conaway|first1=William|title=VI Bomber Command in Defense of the Panama Canal 1941\u201345: Unit Histories: 25th Bombardment Squadron|publisher=planesandpilotsof wwii.totalh.net|url-status=dead|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131031113408/http://www.planesandpilotsofww2.totalh.net/panama/25thbshistorytem.htm |archivedate=31 October 2013|accessdate=10 April 2018}}</ref> It flew various biplane bombers to defend the [[Panama Canal]].

The squadron also flew mercy mission to Chile following the devastating [[1939 Chill\u00e1n earthquake]] in January and February 1939.<ref name=Clay/>\n\n[[File: 25th Bombardment Squadron B-10s.jpg|thumb|Squadron Martin B-10 in Panama, 1935\u20131940]]\nThe squadron equipped with [[Douglas B-18 Bolo]]s and became the '''25th Bombardment Squadron''' (Medium) on 6 December 1939 .<ref name=Conaway/> The squadron had an opportunity to put its new, long-legged aircraft to the test in October 1939, when two Peruvian flyers, en route from the United States to [[Lima, Peru]] on a long-distance flight, were reported missing between the Canal Zone and Peru.  Although eventually found to have made an emergency forced landing in Ecuador, three B-18s of the squadron conducted extensive searches of the area along the 80th meridian some 250 miles to sea. The aircraft carried enough fuel for a flight of 11 hours duration.  On 20 November 1940, the unit became the '''25th Bombardment Squadron''' (Heavy)<ref name=25SRSfacts/> in anticipation of the receipt of [[Boeing B-17E Flying Fortress]]es.  By 25 August 1941, with its pre-war strength at but five B-18s, the Squadron was finally re-equipped with B-17E Flying Fortresses.\n\n===World War II===\n====Antisubmarine campaign====\n[[File: Boeing B-17E Fortress 41-2504 Panama 1942.jpg|thumb|Squadron B-17E Flying Fortress in Panama, 1942]]\nAfter the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], the squadron left its long time home at France Field for [[Rio Hato Airport]], Panama.  Little more than a month later, it began operations from [[Salinas Airfield]], Ecuador and the [[Galapagos Islands]] (shuttling patrols back and forth) with four of the B-17Es, flying antisubmarine patrols over the Pacific approaches to the Panama Canal.  These aircraft being joined by a B-18 by February.  The main body of the Squadron left Salinas by 15 February and returned to [[Howard Field]] in early 1943, although a detachment was still in Ecuador as late as 30 June.\n\nOn 12 May 1943, the squadron was transferred to the [[40th Bombardment Group]] and, the following month, the main body of the squadron, which had been at Howard Field only briefly in the spring of 1943, ended its 21 years of service in the Canal Zone, and moved to the United States.\n\n====Strategic attacks on Japan====\n[[File:25th Bombardment Squadron - B-29 Superfortress.jpg|thumb|Squadron B-29 Superfortress at Chakulia Airfield, India<ref group=note>Aircraft is Boeing B-29-10-BW Superfortress, serial 42-6331.

The aircraft was lost in combat, 1 December 1944.</ref>]]\nThe 25th was stationed at [[Pratt Army Air Field]], Kansas in July 1943 and remanned with new personnel.  It received prototype and early production-model [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress]] very heavy bombers.  It trained under [[Second Air Force]] for an extended period due to [[Boeing]] technicians making modifications to its B-29 aircraft.  It deployed with the new [[XX Bomber Command]] as part of the [[58th Bombardment Wing]] to the [[China-Burma-India Theater]], flying to bases in India via South Atlantic ferrying route; across central Africa and Arabia to [[Karachi]].  Additional modifications to its B-29s were necessary in India to accommodate very high ground temperatures (115&nbsp;\u00b0F).\n\nFrom airfields in eastern India, engaged in very long range bombardment raids on Japan.  The squadron participated in the first American Air Force attack on the Japanese Home Islands since the 1942 [[Doolittle raid]] on 15/16 June 1944, attacking the Imperial Iron and Steel Works at [[Yawata]] on [[Kyushu]] by using its forward staging base at [[Hsinching Airfield]] (A-1), China, for refueling.<ref name=\"B-29\">Mann, {{page needed|date=April 2018}}</ref> It performed a total of nine missions to Japan, also engaged in very long range attacks against enemy targets in Thailand, Manchuria, Borneo, Formosa, Burma, Malaya, Japanese-occupied China, [[Singapore]], [[Saigon]] and [[Cam Rahn Bay]], French Indochina.  It also engaged in aerial mining of Japanese-occupied seaports in Thailand, Malaya and French Indochina.<ref name=\"B-29\"/>\n\nThe advance of American forces in the Central Pacific though the [[Northern Mariana Islands]] made new airfields available within the effective bombing range of Japan.  It moved to [[West Field (Tinian)]] in April 1945, becoming part of the new [[XXI Bomber Command]].  From the Marianas, it engaged in very long range strategic attacks on Japan, its first mission being on 5 May 1945 against the Hiro Naval Aircraft Factory in [[Kure]].  Air attacks over Japan were initially high-altitude daylight bombing missions against industrial, transportation and military targets, largely ineffective due to high upper level winds dispersing bombs over a wide area.  By July, began low-level large area night incendiary raids on urban areas, and dropped mines in Japanese shipping lanes. Continued aerial assaults until the Japanese Capitulation in August 1945, final combat mission taking place on 9/10 August attacking the [[Hikari, Yamaguchi|Hikari]] Naval Arsenal.<ref name=\"B-29\"/>\n\nAfter [[V-J Day]], the squadron dropped food and supplies to Allied prisoners in Japan, Korea, and Formosa, and took part in show-of-force missions.  The squadron returned to the United States in November 1945 and was inactivated at [[Davis-Monthan Field]], Arizona in the fall of 1946.<ref name=25SRSfacts/>\n\n===Strategic bombardment===\n[[File: 25th BS Smoky Hill AFB Kansas flight line.jpg|thumb|Squadron B-47s on Smoky Hill AFB flight line in 1956]]\nThe squadron was reactivated at [[Smoky Hill Air Force Base]], Kansasin 1952 as [[Strategic Air Command]] expanded its bomber force.  The 25th initially received what were by then second-line B-29s for training and organization.  The propeller-driven B-29s were replaced with new [[Boeing B-47E Stratojet]] swept-wing medium bombers in 1954, capable of flying at high subsonic speeds and primarily designed for penetrating the airspace of the Soviet Union. In the 1960s, the B-47 was considered to be reaching obsolescence and was being phased out of SAC's strategic arsenal. The 25th began sending aircraft to other B-47 wings as replacements in early 1964 and was one of the last SAC squadrons equipped with the Stratojet.  The squadron inactivated in September 1964 when the last B-47 aircraft was retired from SAC.\n\n===Strategic weapons training===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:25th STS Strategic Weapons Center.jpeg|thumb|25 STS's $5.4M Strategic Weapons Center at Ellsworth AFB in 1989]] -->\nThe 25th was reactivated in 1988 as a SAC training squadron.  From 1988 to 1992, the 25th supervised SAC [[Boeing B-52H Stratofortress]] bomber crew training and, from 1992 to 1995, [[Air Combat Command]] B-52H and then [[Rockwell B-1 Lancer]] bomber crew training at [[Ellsworth Air Force Base]], South Dakota.

The squadron finally received some British [[Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5]]s, mostly armed with a single fuselage-mounted Vickers machine gun, and flew two missions in November 1918 days before the war ended.  The first patrol was uneventful and the other patrol targeted a truck convoy in [[Metz]] with 20 lb bombs hand-dropped from their S.E. 5a aircraft.

Although eventually found to have made an emergency forced landing in Ecuador, three B-18s of the squadron conducted extensive searches of the area along the 80th meridian some 250 miles to sea. The aircraft carried enough fuel for a flight of 11 hours duration.  On 20 November 1940, the unit became the '''25th Bombardment Squadron''' (Heavy)<ref name=25SRSfacts/> in anticipation of the receipt of [[Boeing B-17E Flying Fortress]]es.  By 25 August 1941, with its pre-war strength at but five B-18s, the Squadron was finally re-equipped with B-17E Flying Fortresses.\n\n===World War II===\n====Antisubmarine campaign====\n[[File: Boeing B-17E Fortress 41-2504 Panama 1942.jpg|thumb|Squadron B-17E Flying Fortress in Panama, 1942]]\nAfter the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], the squadron left its long time home at France Field for [[Rio Hato Airport]], Panama.  Little more than a month later, it began operations from [[Salinas Airfield]], Ecuador and the [[Galapagos Islands]] (shuttling patrols back and forth) with four of the B-17Es, flying antisubmarine patrols over the Pacific approaches to the Panama Canal.  These aircraft being joined by a B-18 by February.  The main body of the Squadron left Salinas by 15 February and returned to [[Howard Field]] in early 1943, although a detachment was still in Ecuador as late as 30 June.\n\nOn 12 May 1943, the squadron was transferred to the [[40th Bombardment Group]] and, the following month, the main body of the squadron, which had been at Howard Field only briefly in the spring of 1943, ended its 21 years of service in the Canal Zone, and moved to the United States.\n\n====Strategic attacks on Japan====\n[[File:25th Bombardment Squadron - B-29 Superfortress.jpg|thumb|Squadron B-29 Superfortress at Chakulia Airfield, India<ref group=note>Aircraft is Boeing B-29-10-BW Superfortress, serial 42-6331.

It received prototype and early production-model [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress]] very heavy bombers.  It trained under [[Second Air Force]] for an extended period due to [[Boeing]] technicians making modifications to its B-29 aircraft.  It deployed with the new [[XX Bomber Command]] as part of the [[58th Bombardment Wing]] to the [[China-Burma-India Theater]], flying to bases in India via South Atlantic ferrying route; across central Africa and Arabia to [[Karachi]].  Additional modifications to its B-29s were necessary in India to accommodate very high ground temperatures (115&nbsp;\u00b0F).\n\nFrom airfields in eastern India, engaged in very long range bombardment raids on Japan.  The squadron participated in the first American Air Force attack on the Japanese Home Islands since the 1942 [[Doolittle raid]] on 15/16 June 1944, attacking the Imperial Iron and Steel Works at [[Yawata]] on [[Kyushu]] by using its forward staging base at [[Hsinching Airfield]] (A-1), China, for refueling.<ref name=\"B-29\">Mann, {{page needed|date=April 2018}}</ref> It performed a total of nine missions to Japan, also engaged in very long range attacks against enemy targets in Thailand, Manchuria, Borneo, Formosa, Burma, Malaya, Japanese-occupied China, [[Singapore]], [[Saigon]] and [[Cam Rahn Bay]], French Indochina.  It also engaged in aerial mining of Japanese-occupied seaports in Thailand, Malaya and French Indochina.<ref name=\"B-29\"/>\n\nThe advance of American forces in the Central Pacific though the [[Northern Mariana Islands]] made new airfields available within the effective bombing range of Japan.  It moved to [[West Field (Tinian)]] in April 1945, becoming part of the new [[XXI Bomber Command]].  From the Marianas, it engaged in very long range strategic attacks on Japan, its first mission being on 5 May 1945 against the Hiro Naval Aircraft Factory in [[Kure]].  Air attacks over Japan were initially high-altitude daylight bombing missions against industrial, transportation and military targets, largely ineffective due to high upper level winds dispersing bombs over a wide area.  By July, began low-level large area night incendiary raids on urban areas, and dropped mines in Japanese shipping lanes. Continued aerial assaults until the Japanese Capitulation in August 1945, final combat mission taking place on 9/10 August attacking the [[Hikari, Yamaguchi|Hikari]] Naval Arsenal.<ref name=\"B-29\"/>\n\nAfter [[V-J Day]], the squadron dropped food and supplies to Allied prisoners in Japan, Korea, and Formosa, and took part in show-of-force missions.  The squadron returned to the United States in November 1945 and was inactivated at [[Davis-Monthan Field]], Arizona in the fall of 1946.<ref name=25SRSfacts/>\n\n===Strategic bombardment===\n[[File: 25th BS Smoky Hill AFB Kansas flight line.jpg|thumb|Squadron B-47s on Smoky Hill AFB flight line in 1956]]\nThe squadron was reactivated at [[Smoky Hill Air Force Base]], Kansasin 1952 as [[Strategic Air Command]] expanded its bomber force.  The 25th initially received what were by then second-line B-29s for training and organization.  The propeller-driven B-29s were replaced with new [[Boeing B-47E Stratojet]] swept-wing medium bombers in 1954, capable of flying at high subsonic speeds and primarily designed for penetrating the airspace of the Soviet Union. In the 1960s, the B-47 was considered to be reaching obsolescence and was being phased out of SAC's strategic arsenal. The 25th began sending aircraft to other B-47 wings as replacements in early 1964 and was one of the last SAC squadrons equipped with the Stratojet.  The squadron inactivated in September 1964 when the last B-47 aircraft was retired from SAC.\n\n===Strategic weapons training===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:25th STS Strategic Weapons Center.jpeg|thumb|25 STS's $5.4M Strategic Weapons Center at Ellsworth AFB in 1989]] -->\nThe 25th was reactivated in 1988 as a SAC training squadron.

{"title_page": "Makholokoe Tribes", "text_new": "{{no footnotes|date=September 2019}}\n\n== Kholokoe Tribe ==\n\n=== Classification ===\nMakgolokoe/Makholokoe/Makgolokwe/Bakholokoe refers to the '''[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tswana_people Bakgatla Tribe]''' of Morena Khetsi/Kgetsi son for Morena Tabane. The Ba/Ma-kholokoe are found in the Easter Free State (Harrismith, Wetsieshoek, Vrede, Kestel, etc.), Kwazulu/Natal(Nqutu) and Mpumalanga (Daggakraal, Amersfoort) as their historical residence. The Ba/Ma-kholokoe are the descendants of the originally Bantu-Speaking tribes from the central Congo region who migrated Southwards around 600 AD. They are the offspring of Bakgatla Chief Tabane and Mathulare daughter of the Bafokeng Chief. Tabane fathered five sons, Diale, Kgetsi, Kgwadi (Motl\u00f4kwa), Matsibolo/Matsiboho, and Mosia (in order of their birth). Each broke away to form Bapedi, Ba/Ma-kholokwe, Batl\u00f4kwa, Maphuthing and Basia respectively. Ba/Ma-kholokoe demonstrated linguistic and cultural characteristics that distinguished them from other Bantu-speakers of southern Africa, with their language showing a merger of South Sotho and [[Nguni language]]s. Other practices included totemism (Ba/Ma-kholokoe totem is Phuthi - Duiker, some still hold on to the fowl, while others the porcupine), the preferential marriage of paternal cousins, and an architectural style characterized by a round hut with a conical thatch roof. The senior house of Ba/Ma-Kholokoe is the house of Moduli/Molupi, they are the Makholokoe a Letseba \"letseba le letsebilae ke mang, le Mokholoane a shoele a sa le tsebe\". Tabane first son from his senior wife Matlaisane remained with the Bakgatla ba Mot\u0161ha group, after Tabane concurred the Ba-Venda nation he married a Ba-Venda wife and fathered a son called Davhana who fathered Vele.\n\n=== History (Nalane) ===\n \nThe traditions of the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolong_tribe Barolong kingdoms] indicate that at some time in the past up until the leadership battles of the 14th Century they were all under the same rule of a line of kings who claimed descent from a common ancestor, Morolong. Following the death of Morolong's 4th generation great- grandson Masilo there was a leadership crisis that resulted in the formation of the Ba-Hurutshe and Ba-Kwena clans. Ba/Ma-kholokoe claim lineage from the Ba-Hurutshe clan and traced their early ancestry to Mokgatla, the founder of the BaKgatla and his 4th generation great grandson Tabane. \n\nAround 1560 Kgetsi/Khetsi(Lekholokoe) son of Tabane married Mabale and fathered Moloi, Moloi married Maleseha and fathered Hlabathe, Hlabathe fathered Sehoala/Sehoele, Sehoala married Malekoesa and fathered Tjale, Tjale fathered Tsholedi, Tsholedi married Malekunya and fathered Motsoane, Motsoane fathered Mokholoane, fathered Matsemela who married Madiale and fathered the five known houses of Kholokoe Leubane, Maphale, Tsele, Motaoane and with Matsholedi fathered Lehasa. \n\nBefore the birth of Kgetsi/Khetsi, his father Tabane with other Bakgatla lived around \"Thaba tsa Mohale\" known today as [[Magaliesberg]], during the 1600s Kgetsi/Khetsi took his group and moved eastwards and North of Lekoa (Vaal) settling near Seratoe today [[Standerton]], at a mountain which since their occupation became Thaba Kholokoe.  This is where Ba/Ma-kholokoe lived for over 200 years, about eight to nine generations until the attacks of Matiwane in 1822, Mzilikazi in 1823 and is considered the birthplace of Ba/Ma-khlokoe. Some of the Ba/Ma-kholokoe Kings/Chief that lived in Thaba Kholokoe:\n- Kgetsi\n- Moloi\n- Hlabate\n- Sehoaba/Sehoele\n- Tyale\n- Tsholedi\n- Motsoane\n- Mokholoane\n- Matsemela\nFrom Thaba Kholokoe Ba/Ma-kholokoe spread to many areas around the Free State and Natal. One group under the leadership of Morena Wetsi (Oetsi) settled in today's Wetsieshoek, where many Ba/Ma-kholokoe were killed inside a [[Witsie's Cave (Lekhalong la Witsie)|cave]] during a war against the Boers. The kinship/chieftaincy of Bakholokoe has always been marked by disagreement and internal feuds, living the legacy for this leadership still in question to this day. \n\nAlthough many consider the totem of Ba/Ma-kholokoe as a [[:nso:Phuti|Phuthi]] (duiker), it is believed that this small antelope led Bakholokoe to safety during a war, there are some that say the Ba/Ma-Kholokoe totem is a porcupine [[Porcupine]].\n\n=== Land (Naha) ===\n \nAlthough one would love to hear the anecdotal side of the Ba-Kholokoe Tribe history, it is unfortunately heavily clouded by the ever-present and festering issue of land and property dispossession and subsequent brutal oppression and painful suffering of the Ba/Ma-Kholokoe Tribe, first from the Dutch \u2015Boer\u2016 Government (Volksraad) of the Free State, and subsequently from the British Orange River Colony Administration and even in the modern times, especially under the Bantustan (Native Homelands) system of the nineteen seventy's and the nineteen eighty's, during which period people like the late Qwaqwa Homeland Prime Minister T.K.Mopeli, ruthlessly sought to and nearly achieved destroying the BaKholokoe Tribe! Much of the history written today states that Qwaqwa formerly known as Wetsieshoek was residence to only two Basotho tribes Bakoena and Batlokoa completely ignoring the presence of Ba/Ma-Kholokoe.\n\nLike many other tribes, Bakholokoe were dispossessed of their land leading to their traditional leaders, the Batlokoa traditional leaders and the then secretary of Bakholokoe traditional council  [[Josiah_Tshangana_Gumede|JT Gumede]] going to England in 1906 to protest the Bakhlokoe and Batlokoa losing their ancestral land to the former Boer republics. \n\nAs early as 1837 the Ba/Ma-Kholokoe tribe was already resident in the northern Free State around the Maluti region, Northern Natal around the Klip River region and the Vaal River region, notably the areas of the Witsieshoek district and the Harrismith district. In 1856 the Ba-Kholokoe, under Morena Wetsi, were forcefully dispossessed of this part of their territory by the Free State Dutch Government, on wholly unjustifiable pretenses, only two years after the Convention of Bloemfontein of 1854.\n\nIn 1866 Commandant C. de Villiers, also popularly known as Masoothonyane, who was then in charge of the Thaba Nchu, i.e. Harrismith district, and a member of the Volksraad, requested the tribes to assist the Free State Government in the war against Moshoeshoe. They rendered military service as the Free Burgher Natives, and their armed contingents were known as the \u2015Witlaps\u2016 and the \u2015Ringhals\u2016. The services were rendered firstly in consideration to secure and confirm the Tribes in free possession of the lands they then occupied, and secondly after successful conclusion of that war in 1868, for the payment of 9450 head of cattle to Commandant De Villiers acting for his Government, he agreed to the enlargement of the lands occupied by the Tribes. He, De Villiers actually promised them that the land, approximately 2130 square miles (551 667 hectares) - which the tribes were already occupying, would be secured for them. This is war talk, since in a way he was indirectly saying that this land that they were occupying could at any time be expropriated, if need be by forceful declaration and action, from them. \n\nAt least up to and according to the guarantees of the Proclamation of 1848, no land occupied by these Tribes had been encroached by any Europeans, so De Villiers appeared to be acting in good faith as based on that Proclamation. After the conclusion of the war in 1868, for the payment of 9450 cattle, it was agreed that all the land occupied mainly by two tribes, BaTlokoa and Ba-Kholokoe, who assisted Commandant De Villiers and the Boers in the war against Moshoeshoe, would then be given to them, after it has also been enlarged. There were three payments which were made for the purchase of three different areas of the land: 2450 cattle paid for the Halspruit area, made by the BaTlokoa tribe, 4000 cattle paid for the Klip Rivier area, the land situated in the Vrede and Harrismith Districts, also made by the BaTlokoa tribe, and 3000 cattle paid for the Mill River Valley in the Harrismith district, made by the Ba-Kholokoe tribe. The payments for the land of the Ba-Tlokoa tribe were made by Morena Lesisa Tsotetsi, who was representing heirs of Morena Letika and Morena Lesala, both who were the late Marena (Chiefs) of the Ba-Tlokoa tribe. He paid the combined 6450 cattle for both the Halspruit and Klip Rivier areas, which were largely occupied by the Ba-Tlokoa tribe. The Halspruit area was home to the Ba-Tlokoa tribe under the late Morena Lesala, and the Klip Rivier area was under the late Morena Letika, both of whom were now represented by Morena Lesisa. The payment for the Mill River Valley land, which covered both Thabantsu and Witsieshoek districts of the Ba-Kholokoe Tribe was made by Morena Letlatsa Moloi, who was representing heirs of the Late Morena Hlomise, son of the late Morena Oetsi (\u2015Witsie\u2016) of the Ba/Ma-Kholokoe Tribe. However, in 1888 the Ba/Ma-Kholokoe Tribe, after having received notice to leave the land, were forcibly evicted without any compensation. The struggle to regain their land had begun. \n\nChief Letlatsa Moloi of the Ba/Ma-Kholokoe Tribe became a thorn in the flesh for Captain John Quayle Dickson, the Advisor for Native Affairs in the British Colonial Orange Free State government. On the 5th of September 1903, Captain John Quayle Dickson wrote to Sir Harry Smith from his office in Bloemfontein indicating that he had visited Thabantsu (Harrismith) where he and the Regional Magistrate of the Thaba Nchu territory had personally met and informed Paramount Chief Letlasa of the Ba-Kholokoe Tribe that from then onwards he would be granted no special privileges whatsoever, and that he was now stripped of his position as one of the well-known and respected Morena oa Ba-Kholokoe, declaring him to be \u2015just another Native\u2016, and therefore from then in his opinion Paramount Chief Letlatsa will give no further trouble. Yet more trouble from the cheated and dispossessed tribes was coming! The boundaries of these areas were well defined as verified at the inquiry held in Harrismith by Captain John Quayle Dickson, Advisor for Native affairs, and Magistrate Leary, as reported in Captain Dickson's letter of 23rd June 1906. A Mr. F Van Reenen also testified to the fact that Commander De Villiers had cheated these native Chiefs in dealing with them, and when this was brought to the knowledge of the Free State government, it forced his resignation from the Volksraad.\n\n=== Battles fought by Ba/Ma-Kholokoe ===\n\nSome of the history states that Ba/Ma-Kholokoe were not great warriors but according to the battles fought, won and lost the Ba/Ma-Kholokoe were as good warriors as any other tribe that lived in that era. Many Battles were fought at Thaba Kholokoe, with Mzilikazi have attacked Ba/Ma-Kholokoe a number of times.\n\nIn 1821 the [https://www.wdl.org/en/item/3269/view/1/231/ battle between (Mahlapo) of Chief Mofeli and Ba/Ma-Kholokoe] under Chief Polane saw Polane and his Son Selotolotsa Killed, alongside many others and their cattle were taken.\n\n[http://wiredspace.wits.ac.za/bitstream/handle/10539/9701/Appendix%201-11.pdf?sequence=2&isAllowed=y In 1856/7 the battle of Ba/Ma-Kholokoe under Chief Wetsi/Oetsi] and the Boers saw many Ba/Makholokoe killed in the cave while Wetsi managed to escape to Lesotho.\n\n=== Genealogical tree of Ba/Ma-kholokoe ===\n\n[[File:New Makholokoe (2).png|thumb|Updated family tree]]\n[[File:Genealogy Bakgatla.jpg|thumb|Genealogy of Bakgatla from Morolong]]\n\n=== Some of the notable Ba/Ma-kholokoe ===\n\n* [[Precious_Moloi-Motsepe|Dr Precious Moloi Motsepe]]\n* [[Teboho Moloi]]\n* Dr Matholela Lucas Moloi\n* Pabi Moloi\n* [[Timothy Moloi]]\n* Nchakha Moloi\n* Vusi Moloi\n* Godfrey Moloi\n* Lehasa Moloi\n* [[Lerato Moloi]]\n* Onicca Moloi\n* Nana Moloi\n* [[Thabo Moloi]]\n=== Sources ===\n\n* DIE MAKHOLOKOE STAMHOOFDE, DIE GEKOSE STAMHOOF \u2013\nLETSITSA (II) \u2013 MOJALEFA OA BORENA BA MAKHOLOKOE\u2016, as\nrecorded in 1429 by the QWAQWA PRINTERS.

The Ba/Ma-kholokoe are found in the Easter Free State (Harrismith, Wetsieshoek, Vrede, Kestel, etc.), Kwazulu/Natal(Nqutu) and Mpumalanga (Daggakraal, Amersfoort) as their historical residence. The Ba/Ma-kholokoe are the descendants of the originally Bantu-Speaking tribes from the central Congo region who migrated Southwards around 600 AD. They are the offspring of Bakgatla Chief Tabane and Mathulare daughter of the Bafokeng Chief. Tabane fathered five sons, Diale, Kgetsi, Kgwadi (Motl\u00f4kwa), Matsibolo/Matsiboho, and Mosia (in order of their birth).

This is where Ba/Ma-kholokoe lived for over 200 years, about eight to nine generations until the attacks of Matiwane in 1822, Mzilikazi in 1823 and is considered the birthplace of Ba/Ma-khlokoe. Some of the Ba/Ma-kholokoe Kings/Chief that lived in Thaba Kholokoe:\n- Kgetsi\n- Moloi\n- Hlabate\n- Sehoaba/Sehoele\n- Tyale\n- Tsholedi\n- Motsoane\n- Mokholoane\n- Matsemela\nFrom Thaba Kholokoe Ba/Ma-kholokoe spread to many areas around the Free State and Natal. One group under the leadership of Morena Wetsi (Oetsi) settled in today's Wetsieshoek, where many Ba/Ma-kholokoe were killed inside a [[Witsie's Cave (Lekhalong la Witsie)|cave]] during a war against the Boers. The kinship/chieftaincy of Bakholokoe has always been marked by disagreement and internal feuds, living the legacy for this leadership still in question to this day. \n\nAlthough many consider the totem of Ba/Ma-kholokoe as a [[:nso:Phuti|Phuthi]] (duiker), it is believed that this small antelope led Bakholokoe to safety during a war, there are some that say the Ba/Ma-Kholokoe totem is a porcupine [[Porcupine]].\n\n=== Land (Naha) ===\n \nAlthough one would love to hear the anecdotal side of the Ba-Kholokoe Tribe history, it is unfortunately heavily clouded by the ever-present and festering issue of land and property dispossession and subsequent brutal oppression and painful suffering of the Ba/Ma-Kholokoe Tribe, first from the Dutch \u2015Boer\u2016 Government (Volksraad) of the Free State, and subsequently from the British Orange River Colony Administration and even in the modern times, especially under the Bantustan (Native Homelands) system of the nineteen seventy's and the nineteen eighty's, during which period people like the late Qwaqwa Homeland Prime Minister T.K.Mopeli, ruthlessly sought to and nearly achieved destroying the BaKholokoe Tribe!

In 1856 the Ba-Kholokoe, under Morena Wetsi, were forcefully dispossessed of this part of their territory by the Free State Dutch Government, on wholly unjustifiable pretenses, only two years after the Convention of Bloemfontein of 1854.\n\nIn 1866 Commandant C. de Villiers, also popularly known as Masoothonyane, who was then in charge of the Thaba Nchu, i.e. Harrismith district, and a member of the Volksraad, requested the tribes to assist the Free State Government in the war against Moshoeshoe. They rendered military service as the Free Burgher Natives, and their armed contingents were known as the \u2015Witlaps\u2016 and the \u2015Ringhals\u2016. The services were rendered firstly in consideration to secure and confirm the Tribes in free possession of the lands they then occupied, and secondly after successful conclusion of that war in 1868, for the payment of 9450 head of cattle to Commandant De Villiers acting for his Government, he agreed to the enlargement of the lands occupied by the Tribes. He, De Villiers actually promised them that the land, approximately 2130 square miles (551 667 hectares) - which the tribes were already occupying, would be secured for them. This is war talk, since in a way he was indirectly saying that this land that they were occupying could at any time be expropriated, if need be by forceful declaration and action, from them. \n\nAt least up to and according to the guarantees of the Proclamation of 1848, no land occupied by these Tribes had been encroached by any Europeans, so De Villiers appeared to be acting in good faith as based on that Proclamation. After the conclusion of the war in 1868, for the payment of 9450 cattle, it was agreed that all the land occupied mainly by two tribes, BaTlokoa and Ba-Kholokoe, who assisted Commandant De Villiers and the Boers in the war against Moshoeshoe, would then be given to them, after it has also been enlarged. There were three payments which were made for the purchase of three different areas of the land: 2450 cattle paid for the Halspruit area, made by the BaTlokoa tribe, 4000 cattle paid for the Klip Rivier area, the land situated in the Vrede and Harrismith Districts, also made by the BaTlokoa tribe, and 3000 cattle paid for the Mill River Valley in the Harrismith district, made by the Ba-Kholokoe tribe. The payments for the land of the Ba-Tlokoa tribe were made by Morena Lesisa Tsotetsi, who was representing heirs of Morena Letika and Morena Lesala, both who were the late Marena (Chiefs) of the Ba-Tlokoa tribe. He paid the combined 6450 cattle for both the Halspruit and Klip Rivier areas, which were largely occupied by the Ba-Tlokoa tribe. The Halspruit area was home to the Ba-Tlokoa tribe under the late Morena Lesala, and the Klip Rivier area was under the late Morena Letika, both of whom were now represented by Morena Lesisa. The payment for the Mill River Valley land, which covered both Thabantsu and Witsieshoek districts of the Ba-Kholokoe Tribe was made by Morena Letlatsa Moloi, who was representing heirs of the Late Morena Hlomise, son of the late Morena Oetsi (\u2015Witsie\u2016) of the Ba/Ma-Kholokoe Tribe. However, in 1888 the Ba/Ma-Kholokoe Tribe, after having received notice to leave the land, were forcibly evicted without any compensation. The struggle to regain their land had begun. \n\nChief Letlatsa Moloi of the Ba/Ma-Kholokoe Tribe became a thorn in the flesh for Captain John Quayle Dickson, the Advisor for Native Affairs in the British Colonial Orange Free State government. On the 5th of September 1903, Captain John Quayle Dickson wrote to Sir Harry Smith from his office in Bloemfontein indicating that he had visited Thabantsu (Harrismith) where he and the Regional Magistrate of the Thaba Nchu territory had personally met and informed Paramount Chief Letlasa of the Ba-Kholokoe Tribe that from then onwards he would be granted no special privileges whatsoever, and that he was now stripped of his position as one of the well-known and respected Morena oa Ba-Kholokoe, declaring him to be \u2015just another Native\u2016, and therefore from then in his opinion Paramount Chief Letlatsa will give no further trouble. Yet more trouble from the cheated and dispossessed tribes was coming! The boundaries of these areas were well defined as verified at the inquiry held in Harrismith by Captain John Quayle Dickson, Advisor for Native affairs, and Magistrate Leary, as reported in Captain Dickson's letter of 23rd June 1906. A Mr. F Van Reenen also testified to the fact that Commander De Villiers had cheated these native Chiefs in dealing with them, and when this was brought to the knowledge of the Free State government, it forced his resignation from the Volksraad.\n\n=== Battles fought by Ba/Ma-Kholokoe ===\n\nSome of the history states that Ba/Ma-Kholokoe were not great warriors but according to the battles fought, won and lost the Ba/Ma-Kholokoe were as good warriors as any other tribe that lived in that era. Many Battles were fought at Thaba Kholokoe, with Mzilikazi have attacked Ba/Ma-Kholokoe a number of times.\n\nIn 1821 the [https://www.wdl.org/en/item/3269/view/1/231/ battle between (Mahlapo) of Chief Mofeli and Ba/Ma-Kholokoe] under Chief Polane saw Polane and his Son Selotolotsa Killed, alongside many others and their cattle were taken.\n\n[http://wiredspace.wits.ac.za/bitstream/handle/10539/9701/Appendix%201-11.pdf?sequence=2&isAllowed=y In 1856/7 the battle of Ba/Ma-Kholokoe under Chief Wetsi/Oetsi] and the Boers saw many Ba/Makholokoe killed in the cave while Wetsi managed to escape to Lesotho.\n\n=== Genealogical tree of Ba/Ma-kholokoe ===\n\n[[File:New Makholokoe (2).png|thumb|Updated family tree]]\n[[File:Genealogy Bakgatla.jpg|thumb|Genealogy of Bakgatla from Morolong]]\n\n=== Some of the notable Ba/Ma-kholokoe ===\n\n* [[Precious_Moloi-Motsepe|Dr Precious Moloi Motsepe]]\n* [[Teboho Moloi]]\n* Dr Matholela Lucas Moloi\n* Pabi Moloi\n* [[Timothy Moloi]]\n* Nchakha Moloi\n* Vusi Moloi\n* Godfrey Moloi\n* Lehasa Moloi\n* [[Lerato Moloi]]\n* Onicca Moloi\n* Nana Moloi\n* [[Thabo Moloi]]\n=== Sources ===\n\n* DIE MAKHOLOKOE STAMHOOFDE, DIE GEKOSE STAMHOOF \u2013\nLETSITSA (II) \u2013 MOJALEFA OA BORENA BA MAKHOLOKOE\u2016, as\nrecorded in 1429 by the QWAQWA PRINTERS.

Food should not only consist of pellets, so a mix of seeds and other hamster-safe ingredients is best. Treats are not important to hamster's health but will increase their trust in you if hand-fed.\n\nTreats such as sunflower seeds and yogurt drops are great for hamsters; though do be aware that yogurt drops must only be given at most once a week because of the amount of sugar in them. Any more than once a week is too much sugar for a hamster.{{sfn|Field|1999|p=26}}\n\nHamsters will drink up to 10ml of water for every 100g of hamster bodyweight.{{sfn|Field|1999|p=26}} Nursing mother hamsters will want extra water.{{sfn|Field|1999|p=26}} It can be difficult to provide fresh water to hamsters in a water dish because they are likely to soil the dish with bedding and need it changed twice daily.{{sfn|Logsdail|2002|p=30}} Water bowls are very easy to clean, and have a very natural drinking angle.

Food should not only consist of pellets, so a mix of seeds and other hamster-safe ingredients is best. Treats are not important to hamster's health but will increase their trust in you if hand-fed.\n\nTreats such as sunflower seeds and yogurt drops are great for hamsters; though do be aware that yogurt drops must only be given at most once a week because of the amount of sugar in them.
