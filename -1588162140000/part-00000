And in practice in many democratic socialist countries, it has not extended to many large corporations.{{sfn|Sargent|2008|p=117}}}}\n\nAnother example is the [[Democratic Socialists of America]] (DSA), with the organisation defining socialism as a decentralised socially-owned economy and rejecting [[Central planning|centralised]], [[Soviet-type economic planning]], writing: {{quote|Social ownership could take many forms, such as worker-owned cooperatives or publicly owned enterprises managed by workers and consumer representatives. Democratic socialists favour as much decentralisation as possible. While the large concentrations of capital in industries such as energy and steel may necessitate some form of state ownership, many consumer-goods industries might be best run as cooperatives.\n\nDemocratic socialists have long rejected the belief that the whole economy should be centrally planned. While we believe that democratic planning can shape major social investments like mass transit, housing, and energy, market mechanisms are needed to determine the demand for many consumer goods.{{sfn|Democratic Socialists of America (FAQ)|loc=\"Doesn't socialism mean that the government will own and run everything?\"}}}}\n\nThe DSA has been critical of self-described socialist states, arguing that \"[j]ust because their bureaucratic elites called them \"socialist\" did not make it so; they also called their regimes \"democratic\".{{sfn|Democratic Socialists of America (FAQ)|loc=\"Hasn't socialism been discredited by the collapse of Communism in the USSR and Eastern Europe?\"}} While ultimately committed to instituting socialism, the DSA focuses the bulk of its political activities on reforms within capitalism, arguing: \"As we are unlikely to see an immediate end to capitalism tomorrow, DSA fights for reforms today that will weaken the power of corporations and increase the power of working people\".{{sfn|Democratic Socialists of America (About)}}\n\nLabour Party politician Peter Hain, who identify with libertarian socialism,{{sfnm|1a1=Hain|1y=1995|2a1=Hain|2y=2000}} gives the following definition: {{quote|Democratic socialism should mean an active, democratically accountable state to underpin individual freedom and deliver the conditions for everyone to be empowered regardless of who they are or what their income is. It should be complemented by decentralisation and empowerment to achieve increased democracy and social justice. [...]\n\nToday democratic socialism's task is to recover the high ground on democracy and freedom through maximum decentralisation of control, ownership and decision making. For socialism can only be achieved if it springs from below by popular demand. The task of socialist government should be an enabling one, not an enforcing one. Its mission is to disperse rather than to concentrate power, with a pluralist notion of democracy at its heart.{{sfn|Hain|2015|pp=133\u2013148}}}}\n\n[[Tony Benn]], another prominent left-wing Labour Party politician,{{sfnm|1a1=Hall|1y=2011|1p=45|2a1=White|2y=2014}} described democratic socialism as a socialism that is \"open, libertarian, pluralistic, humane and democratic; nothing whatever in common with the harsh, centralised, dictatorial and mechanistic images which are purposely presented by our opponents and a tiny group of people who control the mass media in Britain\".{{sfn|Benn|Mullin|1979}}\n\nDemocratic socialism sometimes refers to policies within capitalism as opposed to an ideology that aims to transcend and replace capitalism, although this is not always the case. Robert M. Page, a [[Reader (academic rank)|reader]] in Democratic Socialism and Social Policy at the [[University of Birmingham]], wrote about transformative democratic socialism to refer to the politics of Labour Party [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Clement Attlee]] and its [[Attlee ministry|government]] (a strong [[welfare state]], [[Redistribution of income and wealth|fiscal redistribution]] and some degree of [[public ownership]]) and revisionist democratic socialism as developed by Labour Party politician Anthony Crosland and Labour Party Prime Minister [[Harold Wilson]], arguing: {{quote|The most influential revisionist Labour thinker, Anthony Crosland, contended that a more \"benevolent\" form of capitalism had emerged since the Second World War. [...] According to Crosland, it was now possible to achieve greater equality in society without the need for \"fundamental\" economic transformation. For Crosland, a more meaningful form of equality could be achieved if the growth dividend derived from effective management of the economy was invested in \"pro-poor\" public services rather than through fiscal redistribution.{{sfn|Page|2007}}}}\n\nThe [[Socialist International]], of which almost all democratic socialist, labourist and social democratic parties are members, declares the goal of the development of democratic socialism.{{sfn|Busky|2000|p=8}} Some tendencies of democratic socialism advocate for [[social revolution]] in order to transition to [[socialism]], distinguishing it from some forms of [[social democracy]].{{sfnm|1a1=Edelstein|1y=1993|2a1=Alt|2a2=Chambers|2a3=Garrett|2a4=Kurian|2y=2010|2p=401|3a1=Abjorensen|3y=2019|3p=115}} In Soviet politics, democratic socialism is the version of the Soviet Union model that was reformed in a democratic way.

[[Eugene V.

Instead, he contends that the [[Social class|class differences]] and [[Income inequality|unequal distribution of income]] and [[economic power]] that result from private ownership of industry enable the interests of the dominant class to skew the [[Market (economics)|market]] in their favour, either in the form of [[monopoly]] and [[market power]], or by utilising their [[wealth]] and [[resources]] to legislate government policies that benefit their specific business interests. Additionally, Van\u011bk states that workers in a socialist economy based on cooperative and self-managed enterprises have stronger incentives to maximise productivity because they would receive a share of the profits based on the overall performance of their enterprise, in addition to receiving their fixed wage or salary.{{sfn|Perkins|2016}} Many [[Pre-Marx socialists|pre-Marxian]] and [[Proto-socialism|proto-socialists]] were fervent anti-capitalists just as they were supporters of the free market, including the British philosopher [[Thomas Hodgskin]], the French [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualist]] thinker and [[anarchist]] philosopher [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] and the American philosophers [[Benjamin Tucker]] and [[Lysander Spooner]], among others.{{sfn|Braudel|1979}} Although capitalism has been commonly conflated with the free market, there is a similar ''[[laissez-faire]]'' economic theory and system associated with socialism called [[left-wing laissez-faire]]{{sfnm|1a1=Manley 2014 (Part One)|2a1=Manley 2014 (Part Two)}} to distinguish it from [[laissez-faire capitalism]].{{sfnm|1a1=Carson|1y=2009|2a1=Chartier|2a2=Johnson|2y=2011}}\n\nOne example of this democratic market socialist tendency is mutualism, a democratic and libertarian socialist theory developed by Proudhon in the 18th century, from which [[individualist anarchism]] emerged.

[[Kennington Common]], London, 1848]]\nSocialist [[Socialist economics|models]] and [[Types of socialism|ideas]] espousing [[Common ownership|common]] or [[public ownership]] have existed since [[Ancient history|antiquity]], but the first self-conscious [[History of socialism|socialist movements]] developed in the 1820s and 1830s. Western European [[social critic]]s, including [[Robert Owen]], [[Charles Fourier]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], [[Louis Blanc]], [[Charles Hall (economist)|Charles Hall]] and [[Henri de Saint-Simon]] were the first modern socialists who criticised the excessive poverty and inequality generated by the [[Industrial Revolution]]. The term was first used in English in the British ''Cooperative Magazine'' in 1827 and came to be associated with the followers of the Owen such as the [[Rochdale Pioneers]], who founded the [[co-operative movement]]. Owen's followers stressed both [[participatory democracy]] and economic socialisation in the form of consumer [[co-operative]]s, [[credit unions]] and [[Mutual aid (organization)|mutual aid]] societies. In the case of the [[Owenites]], they also overlapped with a number of other [[working-class]] and [[labour movement]]s such as the [[Chartism|Chartists]] in the United Kingdom.{{sfn|Vincent|2010|p=88}}\n\n[[Fenner Brockway]] identified three early democratic socialist groups during the [[English Civil War]] in his book ''Britain's First Socialists'', namely the [[Levellers]], who were pioneers of political democracy and the sovereignty of the people; the [[Agitators]], who were the pioneers of [[Workers' control|participatory control by the ranks at their workplace]]; and the [[Diggers]], who were pioneers of communal ownership, [[cooperation]] and [[egalitarianism]].{{sfnm|1a1=Brockway|1y=1980|2a1=Hain|2y=1995|2p=12}} The philosophy and tradition of the Diggers and the Levellers was continued in the period described by [[E.

Leaders in the movement also called for a more equitable distribution of income and better living conditions for the working classes. The very first [[trade union]]s and [[consumers' cooperative]] societies also emerged in the hinterland of the Chartist movement as a way of bolstering the fight for these demands.{{sfn|Brandal|Bratberg|Thorsen|2013|p=20}} The first advocates of socialism favoured social levelling in order to create a [[meritocratic]] or [[technocratic]] society based on individual talent as opposed to aristocratic privilege. Saint-Simon is regarded as the first individual to coin the term socialism.{{sfn|Smitha}} Saint-Simon was fascinated by the enormous potential of science and technology and advocated a socialist society that would eliminate the disorderly aspects of [[capitalism]] and would be based on [[equal opportunities]].{{sfn|Australian National University (Birth of the Socialist Idea)}} He advocated the creation of a society in which each person was [[To each according to his contribution|ranked according to his or her capacities and rewarded according to his or her work]].{{sfn|Smitha}} The key focus of Saint-Simon's socialism was on administrative efficiency and industrialism and a belief that science was the key to the progress of human civilisation.{{sfn|Newman|2005}} This was accompanied by a desire to implement a rationally organised economy based on planning and geared towards large-scale scientific progress and material progress, embodying a desire for a more directed or [[planned economy]].{{sfn|Smitha}} The British political philosopher [[John Stuart Mill]] also came to advocate a form of [[Liberal socialism|economic socialism within a liberal context]].

In 1889 (the centennial of the French Revolution of 1789), the [[Second International]] was founded, with 384 delegates from twenty countries representing about 300 labour and socialist organisations.{{sfn|''Marxist History''}} It was termed the Socialist International and [[Friedrich Engels]] was elected honorary president at the third congress in 1893. [[Anarchists]] were ejected and not allowed in mainly due to pressure from [[Marxists]].{{sfn|Woodcock|1962|pp=263\u2013264}} It has been argued that at some point the Second International turned \"into a battleground over the issue of [[Libertarian socialism|libertarian]] versus [[Authoritarian socialism|authoritarian]] socialism. Not only did they effectively present themselves as champions of minority rights; they also provoked the German Marxists into demonstrating a dictatorial intolerance which was a factor in preventing the British labour movement from following the Marxist direction indicated by such leaders as [[Henry Hyndman|H.

Reformism arose as an alternative to revolution, with leading social democrat [[Eduard Bernstein]] proposing the concept of evolutionary socialism. Revolutionary socialists, encompassing multiple social and political movements that may define revolution differently from one another, quickly targeted the nascent ideology of reformism and [[Rosa Luxemburg]] condemned Bernstein's ''[[Eduard Bernstein#Opinions|Evolutionary Socialism]]'' in her 1900 essay titled ''[[Social Reform or Revolution?]]'' The Social Democratic Party of Germany became the largest and most powerful socialist party in Europe despite being an illegal organisation until the [[anti-socialist laws]] were officially repealed in 1890. In the [[1893 German federal election|1893 federal elections]], the party gained about 1,787,000 votes, a quarter of the total votes cast according to Engels. In 1895, the year of his death, Engels highlighted ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'''s emphasis on winning as a first step the \"battle of democracy\".{{sfnm|1a1=Engels|1a2=Marx|1y=1848|1p=52|2a1=Steger|2y=1997|2pp=247\u2013259|3a1=Steger|3y=1999|3pp=181\u2013196}}\n\nIn his introduction to the 1895 edition of Karl Marx's ''[[The Class Struggles in France 1848\u20131850|The Class Struggles in France]]'', Engels attempted to resolve the division between gradualist [[Reformist socialism|reformist]] and [[Revolutionary socialism|revolutionary]] socialists in the Marxist movement by declaring that he was in favour of short-term tactics of electoral politics that included gradualist and evolutionary socialist policies while maintaining his belief that [[revolutionary]] seizure of power by the [[proletariat]] should remain a key goal of the socialist movement. In spite of this attempt by Engels to merge gradualism and revolution, his effort only diluted the distinction of gradualism and revolution and had the effect of strengthening the position of the [[Revisionism (Marxism)|revisionists]].{{sfn|Steger|1999|pp=181\u2013196}} Engels' statements in the French newspaper ''Le Figaro'' in which he argued that \"revolution\" and the \"so-called socialist society\" were not fixed concepts, but rather constantly changing social phenomena and said that this made \"us [socialists] all evolutionists\", increased the public perception that Engels was gravitating towards evolutionary socialism. Engels also wrote that it would be \"suicidal\" to talk about a revolutionary seizure of power at a time when the historical circumstances favoured a parliamentary road to power which he predicted could happen \"as early as 1898\".{{sfnm|1a1=Steger|1y=1997|1pp=247\u2013259|2a1=Steger|2y=1999|2pp=181\u2013196}}\n\nEngels' stance of openly accepting gradualist, evolutionary and parliamentary tactics while claiming that the historical circumstances did not favour revolution caused confusion among political commentators and the public. Bernstein interpreted this as indicating that Engels was moving towards accepting parliamentary reformist and gradualist stances, but he ignored that Engels' stances were tactical as a response to the particular circumstances at that time and that Engels was still committed to revolutionary socialism. Engels was deeply distressed when he discovered that his introduction to a new edition of ''The Class Struggles in France'' had been edited by Bernstein and [[Karl Kautsky]] in a manner which left the impression that he had become a proponent of a peaceful road to socialism.{{sfn|Steger|1999|pp=181\u2013196}}\n\nOn 1 April 1895, four months before his death, Engels wrote to Kautsky as follows: {{quote|I was amazed to see today in the ''Vorw\u00e4rts'' an excerpt from my 'Introduction' that had been printed without my knowledge and tricked out in such a way as to present me as a peace-loving proponent of legality [at all costs].

In February 1917, revolution broke out in Russia in which workers, soldiers and peasants established [[Soviet (council)|soviets]], the monarchy was forced into exile fell and a [[Provisional Government of Russia, 1917|provisional government]] was formed until the election of a [[constituent assembly]]. [[Alexander Kerensky]], a Russian lawyer and revolutionary, became a key political figure in the [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917. After the [[February Revolution]], he joined the newly formed [[Russian Provisional Government]], first as [[Justice ministry|Minister of Justice]], then as [[Minister of War]] and after July as the government's [[List of heads of government of Russia#Russian Provisional Republic|second]] [[Prime Minister of Russia|Minister-Chairman]]. A leader of the moderate-socialist [[Trudoviks|Trudovik]] faction of the [[Socialist Revolutionary Party]], he was also the vice-chairman of the powerful [[Petrograd Soviet]]. After failing to sign a peace treaty with the German Empire which led to massive popular unrest against Kerensky's cabinet, his government was overthrown on 7 November by the [[Bolshevik]]s led by [[Vladimir Lenin]] in the [[October Revolution]]. Soon after the October Revolution, the Constituent Assembly elected Socialist-Revolutionary leader [[Victor Chernov]] as President of a Russian Republic, but it rejected the Bolshevik proposal that endorsed the Soviet decrees on land, peace and workers' control and acknowledged the power of the Soviets of Workers', Soldiers' and Peasants' Deputies.{{sfn|Docherty|Lamb|2006}} As a result, the Bolsheviks declared on the next day that the assembly was elected based on outdated party lists{{sfn|Lenin|1964|p=429}} and the [[All-Russian Central Executive Committee]] of the Soviets promptly dissolved it.{{sfnm|1a1=Lenin|1y=1964|1p=429|2a1=Payne|2y=1964|2pp=425\u2013440}}\n\nAt a conference held on 27 February 1921 in Vienna, parties which did not want to be a part of the [[Communist International]] or the resurrected Second International formed the [[International Working Union of Socialist Parties]] (IWUSP).{{sfn|Docherty|Lamb|2006|p=177}} The ISC and the IWUSP eventually joined to form the LSI in May 1923 at a meeting held Hamburg.{{sfn|Docherty|Lamb|2006|p=197}} Left-wing groups which did not agree to the centralisation and abandonment of the soviets by the [[Bolshevik Party]] led [[left-wing uprisings against the Bolsheviks]].

For their part, the social democrats pointed to the dislocation and chaos caused by revolution and later the growing authoritarianism of the [[communist parties]] after they achieved power. When the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] applied to affiliate with the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] in 1920, it was turned down.

These socialist internationals sought to steer a centrist course between the revolutionaries and the social democrats of the Second International and the perceived anti-democratic Communist International. In contrast, the social democrats of the Second International were seen as insufficiently socialist and had been compromised by their support for World War I. The key movements within the IWUSP were the [[Austromarxists]] and the British [[Independent Labour Party]] while the main forces in the London Bureau were the Independent Labour Party and the [[Workers' Party of Marxist Unification]].{{sfnm|1a1=Polasky|1y=1995|2a1=Wagner|2y=1996}}\n\n=== Mid-20th century ===\n[[File:Clement Attlee.png|thumb|left|[[Clement Attlee]], [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]]]]\nAfter World War II, democratic socialist, labourist and social democratic governments introduced [[social reform]]s and [[wealth redistribution]] via [[welfare state]] [[Social welfare|social programmes]] and [[progressive taxation]].

For another, socialism leads to a tug of war between the state, bent on enforcing its economic monopoly, and the ordinary citizen, equally determined to evade it; the result is repression and the creation of specialized repressive organs.{{sfn|Barrett|1978}}}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{cols|colwidth=21em}}\n* [[Democratic capitalism]]\n* [[Democratic liberalism]]\n* [[Democratic Socialist Party]]\n* [[International Group of Democratic Socialists]]\n* [[List of anti-capitalist and communist parties with national parliamentary representation]]\n* [[List of democratic socialist parties that have governed]]\n* [[List of democratic socialist parties and organizations]]\n* [[List of democratic socialists]]\n* [[List of Labour parties]]\n* [[List of left-wing political parties]]\n* [[List of social democratic parties]]\n* [[List of social democrats]]\n* [[Republican democracy]]\n* [[Social Democratic Party]]\n* [[Socialist Party]]\n* [[Soviet democracy]]\n* [[Workers' council]]\n{{colend}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n==== Books ====\n{{refbegin|40em|indent=yes}}\n: {{cite book|last=Abjorensen|first=Norman|date=15 June 2019|title=Historical Dictionary of Democracy|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=9781538120743|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite book|last1=Adam|first1=Christopher|last2=Egervari|first2=Tibor|last3=Laczko|first3=Leslie|last4=Young|first4=Judy|year=2010|title=The 1956 Hungarian Revolution: Hungarian and Canadian Perspectives|publisher=University of Ottawa Press|isbn=9780776607054|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite book|last=Adams|first=Ian|year=1998|title=Ideology and Politics in Britain Today|edition=illustrated, reprint|series=Politics Today|location=Manchester, England|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=9780719050565}}\n: {{cite book|last=Adams|first=Ian|year=1999|title=Political Ideology Today|series=Politics Today|chapter=Social democracy to New Labour|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=9780719050565|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite book|last=Agust\u00edn|first=\u00d3scar Garc\u00eda|year=2020|title=Left-Wing Populism: The Politics of the People|publisher=Emerald Group Publishing|isbn=9781839092039|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite book|last1=Alistair|first1=Mason|last2=Pyper|first2=Hugh|year=2000|editor-last=Hastings|editor-first=Adrian|title=The Oxford Companion to Christian Thought|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780198600244|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite book|last=Almeida|first=Dimitri|year=2012|title=The Impact of European Integration on Political Parties: Beyond the Permissive Consensus|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780415693745|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite book|last1=Anderson|first1=Gary L.|last2=Herr|first2=Kathryn G.|year=2007|title=Encyclopedia of Activism and Social Justice|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=9781412918121|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite book|last1=Appel|first1=Hilary|last2=Orenstein|first2=Mitchell A.|year=2018|title=From Triumph to Crisis: Neoliberal Economic Reform in Postcommunist Countries|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781108435055|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite book|last=Arora|first=N.

description|type of socialism that advocates democracy and social ownership}}\n{{socialism sidebar|variants}}\n{{social democracy sidebar|variants}}\n'''Democratic socialism''' is a [[political philosophy]] supporting [[political democracy]] within a [[socially owned]] economy,{{sfnm|1a1=Sinclair|1y=1918|2a1=Busky|2y=2000|2p=7|3a1=Abjorensen|3y=2019|3p=115}} with a particular emphasis on [[workers' self-management]] and [[Workplace democracy|democratic control of economic institutions]]{{sfn|Edelstein|1993}} within a [[market socialist economy]] or some form of a [[decentralised planned]] [[socialist economy]].{{sfn|Anderson|Herr|2007|p=448}} Some democratic socialists argue that [[capitalism]] is inherently incompatible with the values of [[freedom]], [[Egalitarianism|equality]] and [[solidarity]] and that these [[Ideal (ethics)|ideals]] can only be achieved through the realisation of a socialist society.{{sfn|Alt|Chambers|Garrett|Kurian|2010|p=401}} Although most democratic socialists seek a gradual transition to [[socialism]],{{sfnm|1a1=Busky|1y=2000|1p=10|2a2=Heywood|2y=2012|2p=97}} democratic socialism can support either [[revolutionary]] or [[reformist]] politics as means to establish socialism.{{sfnm|1a1=Alt|1a2=Chambers|1a3=Garrett|1a4=Kurian|1y=2010|1p=401|2a1=Abjorensen|2y=2019|2p=115}} As a term, it was popularised by social democrats who were opposed to the [[authoritarian socialist]] development in Russia and elsewhere during the 20th century.{{sfnm|1a1=Williams|1y=1985|1p=289|2a1=Foley|2y=1994|2p=23|3a1=Eatwell|3a2=Wright|3y=1999|3p=80|4a1=Busky|4y=2000|4pp=7\u20138}}\n\nThe origins of democratic socialism can be traced to 19th-century utopian socialist thinkers and the British [[Chartism|Chartist]] movement that somewhat differed in their goals yet all shared the essence of democratic decision making and [[public

[[Eugene V.

Instead, he contends that the [[Social class|class differences]] and [[Income inequality|unequal distribution of income]] and [[economic power]] that result from private ownership of industry enable the interests of the dominant class to skew the [[Market (economics)|market]] in their favour, either in the form of [[monopoly]] and [[market power]], or by utilising their [[wealth]] and [[resources]] to legislate government policies that benefit their specific business interests. Additionally, Van\u011bk states that workers in a socialist economy based on cooperative and self-managed enterprises have stronger incentives to maximise productivity because they would receive a share of the profits based on the overall performance of their enterprise, in addition to receiving their fixed wage or salary.{{sfn|Perkins|2016}} Many [[Pre-Marx socialists|pre-Marxian]] and [[Proto-socialism|proto-socialists]] were fervent anti-capitalists just as they were supporters of the free market, including the British philosopher [[Thomas Hodgskin]], the French [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualist]] thinker and [[anarchist]] philosopher [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] and the American philosophers [[Benjamin Tucker]] and [[Lysander Spooner]], among others.{{sfn|Braudel|1979}} Although capitalism has been commonly conflated with the free market, there is a similar ''[[laissez-faire]]'' economic theory and system associated with socialism called [[left-wing laissez-faire]]{{sfnm|1a1=Manley 2014 (Part One)|2a1=Manley 2014 (Part Two)}} to distinguish it from [[laissez-faire capitalism]].{{sfnm|1a1=Carson|1y=2009|2a1=Chartier|2a2=Johnson|2y=2011}}\n\nOne example of this democratic market socialist tendency is mutualism, a democratic and libertarian socialist theory developed by Proudhon in the 18th century, from which [[individualist anarchism]] emerged.

McNally criticises market socialists for believing in the possibility of fair markets based on equal exchanges to be achieved by purging parasitical elements from the market economy such as private ownership of the means of production, arguing that market socialism is an oxymoron when socialism is defined as an end to [[wage labour]].{{sfn|McNally|1993}}\n\n=== Implementation ===\nWhile ''socialism'' is commonly used to describe Marxism\u2013Leninism and affiliated states and governments, there have also been several [[List of anarchist communities|anarchist]] and [[List of socialist states#Ephemeral|socialist]] societies that followed democratic socialist principles, encompassing [[Anti-authoritarianism|anti-authoritarian]] and democratic [[anti-capitalism]].{{sfn|Waxman|2018}} The most notable historical examples are the [[Paris Commune]], the various [[Soviet republic (system of government)|soviet republics]] established in the post-World War I period, early Soviet Russia before the abolition of [[Soviet (council)|soviet councils]] by the [[Bolsheviks]], [[Revolutionary Catalonia]] as noted by [[George Orwell]]{{sfn|Orwell|1980|pp=4\u20136}} and more recently [[Rojava]] in northern [[Syria]].{{sfn|Ramnath|2019|p=691}} Other examples include the [[kibbutzim]] in modern-day [[Israel]],{{sfn|Goldenberg|Wekerle|1972|pp=224\u2013232}} [[Marinaleda]] in [[Spain]],{{sfn|Hancox|2013}} the [[Rebel Zapatista Autonomous Municipalities|Zapatistas]] of [[EZLN]] in [[Chiapas]]{{sfnm|1a1=Esteva|1y=2013|2a1=Vidal|2y=2018}} and to some extent the [[workers' self-management]] policies within the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] and [[Cuba]].{{sfn|Al Jazeera|2019}} However, the best known example is that of [[Presidential Republic (1925\u20131973)|Chile]] under [[President of Chile|President]] [[Salvador Allende]],{{sfnm|1a1=Mabry|1y=1975|2a1=BBC|2y=2003|3a1=Patsouras|3y=2005|3p=265|5a1=Winn|5y=2004|5p=16}} who was violently overthrown in a [[1973 Chilean coup d'\u00e9tat|military coup]] funded and backed by the [[CIA]] in 1973.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=7}}\n\nWhen [[nationalisation]] of large industries was relatively widespread during the [[Keynesian]] [[post-war consensus]], it was not uncommon for some political commentators to describe several European countries as democratic socialist states seeking to move their countries toward a [[socialist economy]].{{sfnm|1a1=Barrett|1y=1978|2a1=Heilbroner|2y=1991|2pp=96\u2013110|3a1=Kendall|3y=2011|3p=125|4a1=Li|4y=2015|4p=69}} In 1956, leading British [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] politician [[Anthony Crosland]] claimed that capitalism had been abolished in Britain, although others such as Welshman [[Aneurin Bevan]], Minister of Health in the first [[Attlee ministry|post-war Labour government]] and the architect of the [[National Health Service]], disputed the claim that Britain was a socialist state.{{sfnm|1a1=Socialist Party of Great Britain|1y=1958|2a1=Crosland|2y=2006|2pp=9, 89}} For Crosland and others who supported his views, Britain was a socialist state.

[[Kennington Common]], London, 1848]]\nSocialist [[Socialist economics|models]] and [[Types of socialism|ideas]] espousing [[Common ownership|common]] or [[public ownership]] have existed since [[Ancient history|antiquity]], but the first self-conscious [[History of socialism|socialist movements]] developed in the 1820s and 1830s. Western European [[social critic]]s, including [[Robert Owen]], [[Charles Fourier]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], [[Louis Blanc]], [[Charles Hall (economist)|Charles Hall]] and [[Henri de Saint-Simon]] were the first modern socialists who criticised the excessive poverty and inequality generated by the [[Industrial Revolution]]. The term was first used in English in the British ''Cooperative Magazine'' in 1827 and came to be associated with the followers of the Owen such as the [[Rochdale Pioneers]], who founded the [[co-operative movement]]. Owen's followers stressed both [[participatory democracy]] and economic socialisation in the form of consumer [[co-operative]]s, [[credit unions]] and [[Mutual aid (organization)|mutual aid]] societies. In the case of the [[Owenites]], they also overlapped with a number of other [[working-class]] and [[labour movement]]s such as the [[Chartism|Chartists]] in the United Kingdom.{{sfn|Vincent|2010|p=88}}\n\n[[Fenner Brockway]] identified three early democratic socialist groups during the [[English Civil War]] in his book ''Britain's First Socialists'', namely the [[Levellers]], who were pioneers of political democracy and the sovereignty of the people; the [[Agitators]], who were the pioneers of [[Workers' control|participatory control by the ranks at their workplace]]; and the [[Diggers]], who were pioneers of communal ownership, [[cooperation]] and [[egalitarianism]].{{sfnm|1a1=Brockway|1y=1980|2a1=Hain|2y=1995|2p=12}} The philosophy and tradition of the Diggers and the Levellers was continued in the period described by [[E. P. Thompson]] in ''[[The Making of the English Working Class]]'' by [[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobin]] groups like the [[London Corresponding Society]] and by polemicists such as [[Thomas Paine]].{{sfn|Monahan|2015}} Their concern for both [[democracy]] and [[social justice]] marked them out as key precursors of democratic socialism.{{sfnm|1a1=Thompson|1y=1963|2a1=Thrale|2y=1983|3a1=Taylor|3y=2007}} Democratic socialism also has its origins in the [[Revolutions of 1848]] and the French [[The Mountain (1849)|Democratic Socialists]], although [[Karl Marx]] disliked the movement because he viewed it as a party dominated by the middle class and associated to them the word ''Sozialdemokrat'', the first recorded use of the term [[social democracy]].{{sfn|Aspalter|2001|p=53}}\n\nThe Chartists gathered significant numbers around the [[People's Charter of 1838]] which demanded the extension of [[Universal manhood suffrage|suffrage to all male adults]]. Leaders in the movement also called for a more equitable distribution of income and better living conditions for the working classes. The very first [[trade union]]s and [[consumers' cooperative]] societies also emerged in the hinterland of the Chartist movement as a way of bolstering the fight for these demands.{{sfn|Brandal|Bratberg|Thorsen|2013|p=20}} The first advocates of socialism favoured social levelling in order to create a [[meritocratic]] or [[technocratic]] society based on individual talent as opposed to aristocratic privilege. Saint-Simon is regarded as the first individual to coin the term socialism.{{sfn|Smitha}} Saint-Simon was fascinated by the enormous potential of science and technology and advocated a socialist society that would eliminate the disorderly aspects of [[capitalism]] and would be based on [[equal opportunities]].{{sfn|Australian National University (Birth of the Socialist Idea)}} He advocated the creation of a society in which each person was [[To each according to his contribution|ranked according to his or her capacities and rewarded according to his or her work]].{{sfn|Smitha}} The key focus of Saint-Simon's socialism was on administrative efficiency and industrialism and a belief that science was the key to the progress of human civilisation.{{sfn|Newman|2005}} This was accompanied by a desire to implement a rationally organised economy based on planning and geared towards large-scale scientific progress and material progress, embodying a desire for a more directed or [[planned economy]].{{sfn|Smitha}} The British political philosopher [[John Stuart Mill]] also came to advocate a form of [[Liberal socialism|economic socialism within a liberal context]]. In later editions of ''[[Principles of Political Economy]]'' (1848), Mill would argue that \"as far as economic theory was concerned, there is nothing in principle in economic theory that precludes an economic order based on socialist policies\".{{sfnm|1a1=Wilson|1y=2007|2a1=Baum|2y=2007}} Similarly, the American social reformer [[Henry George]]{{sfn|Sargent|2008|p=118}} and his [[geoist]] movement influenced the development of democratic socialism,{{sfnm|1a1=Jones|1y=1988|1pp=473\u2013491|2a1=Busky|2y=2000|2p=150|3a1=Corfe|3y=2000|3p=153|4a1=Hudson|4y=2003}} especially in relation to British socialism{{sfn|Freeden|Sargent|Stears|2013|p=356}} and Fabianism,{{sfn|Gay|1952|p=95}} along with Mill and the German [[historical school of economics]].{{sfnm|1a1=Salvadori|1y=1968|1p=252|2a1=Kloppenberg|2y=1986|2p=471}}\n\n[[File:jameskeirhardie.jpg|thumb|[[James Keir Hardie]], an early democratic socialist who founded the British [[Independent Labour Party]]]]\nIn the United Kingdom, the democratic socialist tradition was represented by [[William Morris]]'s [[Socialist League (UK, 1885)|Socialist League]] and in the 1880s by the [[Fabian Society]] and later the [[Independent Labour Party]] founded by [[Keir Hardie]] in the 1890s, of which writer [[George Orwell]] would later become a prominent member.{{sfnm|1a1=Thompson|1y=1977|2a1=James|2a2=Jowitt|2a3=Laybourn|2y=1992|3a1=Reisman 1996 ('''3''')|4a1=Busky|4y=2000|4pp=83\u201385; 91\u2013109|4loc=\"Democratic Socialism in Great Britain and Ireland\"}} In the early 1920s, the [[guild socialism]] of [[G. D. H.

Originally, the Fabian Society was committed to the establishment of a [[socialist economy]], alongside a commitment to [[British imperialism]] and [[colonialism]] as a progressive and modernising force.{{sfn|Day|Gaido|2011|p=249}} Today, the society functions primarily as a [[think tank]] and is one of the fifteen [[Socialist society (Labour Party)|socialist societies]] affiliated with the Labour Party. Similar societies exist in Australia (the [[Australian Fabian Society]]), in Canada (the [[Douglas-Coldwell Foundation]] and the now disbanded [[League for Social Reconstruction]]) and in New Zealand. In 1889 (the centennial of the French Revolution of 1789), the [[Second International]] was founded, with 384 delegates from twenty countries representing about 300 labour and socialist organisations.{{sfn|''Marxist History''}} It was termed the Socialist International and [[Friedrich Engels]] was elected honorary president at the third congress in 1893. [[Anarchists]] were ejected and not allowed in mainly due to pressure from [[Marxists]].{{sfn|Woodcock|1962|pp=263\u2013264}} It has been argued that at some point the Second International turned \"into a battleground over the issue of [[Libertarian socialism|libertarian]] versus [[Authoritarian socialism|authoritarian]] socialism. Not only did they effectively present themselves as champions of minority rights; they also provoked the German Marxists into demonstrating a dictatorial intolerance which was a factor in preventing the British labour movement from following the Marxist direction indicated by such leaders as [[Henry Hyndman|H. M. Hyndman]]\".{{sfn|Woodcock|1962|p=263}}\n\n[[File:Bernstein Eduard 1895.jpg|thumb|left|[[Eduard Bernstein]], a socialist theorist within the [[German Social Democratic Party]] who proposed that socialism could be achieved by peaceful means through incremental legislative reforms in democratic societies]]\nIn Germany, democratic socialism became a prominent movement at the end of the 19th century, when the Eisenach's [[Social Democratic Workers' Party of Germany]] merged with Lassalle's [[General German Workers' Association]] in 1875 to form the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]]. Reformism arose as an alternative to revolution, with leading social democrat [[Eduard Bernstein]] proposing the concept of evolutionary socialism. Revolutionary socialists, encompassing multiple social and political movements that may define revolution differently from one another, quickly targeted the nascent ideology of reformism and [[Rosa Luxemburg]] condemned Bernstein's ''[[Eduard Bernstein#Opinions|Evolutionary Socialism]]'' in her 1900 essay titled ''[[Social Reform or Revolution?]]'' The Social Democratic Party of Germany became the largest and most powerful socialist party in Europe despite being an illegal organisation until the [[anti-socialist laws]] were officially repealed in 1890. In the [[1893 German federal election|1893 federal elections]], the party gained about 1,787,000 votes, a quarter of the total votes cast according to Engels. In 1895, the year of his death, Engels highlighted ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'''s emphasis on winning as a first step the \"battle of democracy\".{{sfnm|1a1=Engels|1a2=Marx|1y=1848|1p=52|2a1=Steger|2y=1997|2pp=247\u2013259|3a1=Steger|3y=1999|3pp=181\u2013196}}\n\nIn his introduction to the 1895 edition of Karl Marx's ''[[The Class Struggles in France 1848\u20131850|The Class Struggles in France]]'', Engels attempted to resolve the division between gradualist [[Reformist socialism|reformist]] and [[Revolutionary socialism|revolutionary]] socialists in the Marxist movement by declaring that he was in favour of short-term tactics of electoral politics that included gradualist and evolutionary socialist policies while maintaining his belief that [[revolutionary]] seizure of power by the [[proletariat]] should remain a key goal of the socialist movement. In spite of this attempt by Engels to merge gradualism and revolution, his effort only diluted the distinction of gradualism and revolution and had the effect of strengthening the position of the [[Revisionism (Marxism)|revisionists]].{{sfn|Steger|1999|pp=181\u2013196}} Engels' statements in the French newspaper ''Le Figaro'' in which he argued that \"revolution\" and the \"so-called socialist society\" were not fixed concepts, but rather constantly changing social phenomena and said that this made \"us [socialists] all evolutionists\", increased the public perception that Engels was gravitating towards evolutionary socialism. Engels also wrote that it would be \"suicidal\" to talk about a revolutionary seizure of power at a time when the historical circumstances favoured a parliamentary road to power which he predicted could happen \"as early as 1898\".{{sfnm|1a1=Steger|1y=1997|1pp=247\u2013259|2a1=Steger|2y=1999|2pp=181\u2013196}}\n\nEngels' stance of openly accepting gradualist, evolutionary and parliamentary tactics while claiming that the historical circumstances did not favour revolution caused confusion among political commentators and the public. Bernstein interpreted this as indicating that Engels was moving towards accepting parliamentary reformist and gradualist stances, but he ignored that Engels' stances were tactical as a response to the particular circumstances at that time and that Engels was still committed to revolutionary socialism. Engels was deeply distressed when he discovered that his introduction to a new edition of ''The Class Struggles in France'' had been edited by Bernstein and [[Karl Kautsky]] in a manner which left the impression that he had become a proponent of a peaceful road to socialism.{{sfn|Steger|1999|pp=181\u2013196}}\n\nOn 1 April 1895, four months before his death, Engels wrote to Kautsky as follows: {{quote|I was amazed to see today in the ''Vorw\u00e4rts'' an excerpt from my 'Introduction' that had been printed without my knowledge and tricked out in such a way as to present me as a peace-loving proponent of legality [at all costs]. Which is all the more reason why I should like it to appear in its entirety in the ''Neue Zeit'' in order that this disgraceful impression may be erased. I shall leave Liebknecht in no doubt as to what I think about it and the same applies to those who, irrespective of who they may be, gave him this opportunity of perverting my views and, what's more, without so much as a word to me about it.{{sfn|Engels|2004|p=86}}}}\n\n=== Early 20th century ===\n[[File:Eugene V.

Soon after the October Revolution, the Constituent Assembly elected Socialist-Revolutionary leader [[Victor Chernov]] as President of a Russian Republic, but it rejected the Bolshevik proposal that endorsed the Soviet decrees on land, peace and workers' control and acknowledged the power of the Soviets of Workers', Soldiers' and Peasants' Deputies.{{sfn|Docherty|Lamb|2006}} As a result, the Bolsheviks declared on the next day that the assembly was elected based on outdated party lists{{sfn|Lenin|1964|p=429}} and the [[All-Russian Central Executive Committee]] of the Soviets promptly dissolved it.{{sfnm|1a1=Lenin|1y=1964|1p=429|2a1=Payne|2y=1964|2pp=425\u2013440}}\n\nAt a conference held on 27 February 1921 in Vienna, parties which did not want to be a part of the [[Communist International]] or the resurrected Second International formed the [[International Working Union of Socialist Parties]] (IWUSP).{{sfn|Docherty|Lamb|2006|p=177}} The ISC and the IWUSP eventually joined to form the LSI in May 1923 at a meeting held Hamburg.{{sfn|Docherty|Lamb|2006|p=197}} Left-wing groups which did not agree to the centralisation and abandonment of the soviets by the [[Bolshevik Party]] led [[left-wing uprisings against the Bolsheviks]].

Trained as a dancer, Loy devoted herself fully to an acting career following a few minor roles in [[silent film]]s. She was originally typecast in exotic roles, often as a [[femme fatale|vamp]] or a woman of Asian descent, but her career prospects improved greatly following her portrayal of [[Nick and Nora Charles|Nora Charles]] in ''[[The Thin Man (film)|The Thin Man]]'' (1934).{{Sfn|Curtis|2011|page=333}}\n\nBorn in [[Helena, Montana]], Loy was raised in rural [[Radersburg, Montana|Radersburg]] during her early childhood, before relocating to [[Los Angeles]] with her mother in her early adolescence. There, she began studying dance, and trained extensively throughout her high school education. She was discovered by production designer [[Natacha Rambova]], who helped facilitate film auditions for her, and she began obtaining small roles in the late 1920s, mainly portraying vamps. Her role in ''The Thin Man'' helped elevate her reputation as a versatile actress, and she reprised the role of [[Nora Charles]] five more times.\n\nLoy's career began to slow in the 1940s, and she appeared in only a few films in the 1950s, including a lead role in the comedy ''[[Cheaper by the Dozen (1950 film)|Cheaper by the Dozen]]'' (1950), as well as supporting parts in ''[[The Ambassador's Daughter (1956 film)|The Ambassador's Daughter]]'' (1956) and the drama ''[[Lonelyhearts]]'' (1958). She appeared in only eight films between 1960 and 1981, after which she retired from acting.\n\nAlthough Loy was never nominated for an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]], in March 1991 she received an [[Academy Honorary Award|Honorary Academy Award]] in recognition of her life's work both onscreen and off, including serving as assistant to the director of military and naval welfare for the [[Red Cross]] during [[World War II]], and a member-at-large of the U.S. Commission to [[UNESCO]].

Although her mother tried to persuade her husband to move to California permanently, he preferred ranch life and the three eventually returned to Montana. Soon afterward, Loy's mother needed a [[hysterectomy]] and insisted Los Angeles was a safer place to have it done, so she, Loy, and Loy's brother David moved to [[Santa Monica neighborhoods#Ocean Park Neighborhood|Ocean Park]], where Loy began to take dancing lessons.{{sfn|Leider|2011|p=22}} After the family returned to Montana, Loy continued her dancing lessons, and at the age of 12, Myrna Williams made her stage debut performing a dance she had choreographed based on \"The Blue Bird\" from the ''Rose Dream'' operetta<ref>Willis, Gertruce Knox and Mrs. R.R.

She obtained work at [[Grauman's Egyptian Theatre]], where she performed in what were called prologues, elaborate musical sequences that were related to and served as preliminary entertainment before the feature film. During this period, Loy saw [[Eleonora Duse]] in the play ''Thy Will Be Done'', and the simple acting techniques she employed made such an impact on Loy that she tried to emulate them throughout her career.{{sfn|Kotsilibas-Davis|Loy|1987|pages=33\u201334}}\n\n===1925\u20131932: Career beginnings===\n[[File:Myrna-Loy-1925.jpg|thumb|In its September 1925 issue, ''[[Motion Picture Magazine|Motion Picture]]'' magazine featured two Henry Waxman photographs of Loy, costumed by [[Adrian (costume designer)|Adrian]], as she appeared in ''[[What Price Beauty?]]'' ]]\n\nWhile Loy was dancing in prologues at the [[Grauman's Egyptian Theatre]], portrait photographer Henry Waxman took several pictures of her that were noticed by [[Rudolph Valentino]] when the actor went to Waxman's studio for a sitting.{{sfn|Leider|2011|pages=34\u201338}} Valentino was looking for a leading lady for ''[[Cobra (1925 film)|Cobra]]'', the first independent project he and his wife [[Natacha Rambova]] were producing.{{sfn|Leider|2011|pages=47\u201348}} Loy tested for the role, which went to [[Gertrude Olmstead]] instead, but soon after she was hired as an [[Extra (actor)|extra]] for ''[[Pretty Ladies]]'' (1925), in which she and fellow newcomer [[Joan Crawford]] were among a bevy of chorus girls dangling from an elaborate chandelier.{{sfn|Kotsilibas-Davis|Loy|1987|pages=37\u201341}}\n\nRambova hired Loy for a small but showy role opposite [[Nita Naldi]] in ''[[What Price Beauty?]]'', a film she was producing. Shot in May 1925, the film remained unreleased for three years; but [[Film still|stills]] of Loy in her exotic makeup and costume appeared in ''[[Motion Picture Magazine|Motion Picture]]'' magazine and led to a contract with [[Warner Bros.]] There, her surname was changed from Williams to Loy.{{sfn|Kotsilibas-Davis|Loy|1987|pages=42\u201343}}\n\nLoy's [[silent film]] roles were mainly as a vamp or ''[[femme fatale]]'', and she frequently portrayed characters of Asian or Eurasian background in films such as ''[[Across the Pacific (1926 film)|Across the Pacific]]'' (1926), ''[[A Girl in Every Port (1928 film)|A Girl in Every Port]]'' (1928), ''[[The Crimson City]]'' (1928), ''[[The Black Watch]]'' (1929), and ''[[The Desert Song (1929 film)|The Desert Song]]'' (1929), which she later recalled \"kind of solidified my exotic non-American image.\"{{sfn|Kotsilibas-Davis|Loy|1987|p=66}} In 1930 she appeared in ''[[The Great Divide (1929 film)|The Great Divide]]''. It took years for her to overcome this stereotype, and as late as 1932, she was cast as a villainous Eurasian in ''[[Thirteen Women]]'' (1932). She also played, opposite [[Boris Karloff]], the depraved sadistic daughter of the title character in ''[[The Mask of Fu Manchu]]'' (1932).\n\nIn 1932, Loy began dating producer [[Arthur Hornblow Jr.]], when he was still married to his wife, Juliette Crosby.{{sfn|Leider|2011|p=92}} \nPrior to that, Loy appeared in small roles in ''[[The Jazz Singer]]'' and a number of early lavish [[Technicolor]] musicals, including ''[[The Show of Shows]]'', ''[[The Bride of the Regiment]]'', and ''[[Under a Texas Moon (film)|Under a Texas Moon]]''. As a result, she became associated with musical roles, and when they began to lose favor with the public, her career went into a slump. In 1934, Loy appeared in ''[[Manhattan Melodrama]]'' with [[Clark Gable]] and [[William Powell]]. When gangster [[John Dillinger]] was shot to death after leaving a screening of the film at the [[Biograph Theater]] in Chicago, the film received widespread publicity, with some newspapers reporting that Loy had been Dillinger's favorite actress.{{sfn|Kotsilibas-Davis|Loy|1987|p=97}}\n\n===1933\u20131938: Rise to stardom===\n[[File:Thin-Man-Loy-Powell-Skippy.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Loy, [[William Powell]] and [[Skippy (dog)|Asta]] in ''[[The Thin Man (film)|The Thin Man]]'' (1934)]]\nAfter appearing with [[Ram\u00f3n Novarro]] in ''[[The Barbarian (1933 film)|The Barbarian]]'' (1933), Loy was cast as [[Nick and Nora Charles|Nora Charles]] in the 1934 film ''[[The Thin Man (film)|The Thin Man]]''. Director [[W. S. Van Dyke]] chose Loy after he detected a wit and sense of humor that her previous films had not revealed.

Loy received excellent reviews and was acclaimed for her comedic skills. Her costar [[William Powell]] and she proved to be a popular screen couple and appeared in 14 films together, [[William Powell and Myrna Loy|one of the most prolific pairings]] in [[Hollywood]] history.

Such films as ''[[Wife vs. Secretary]]'' (1936) with Clark Gable and [[Jean Harlow]], and ''[[Petticoat Fever]]'' (1936) with [[Robert Montgomery (actor)|Robert Montgomery]] gave her opportunity to develop comedic skills. She made four films in close succession with William Powell: ''[[Libeled Lady]]'' (1936), which also starred Jean Harlow and [[Spencer Tracy]]; ''[[The Great Ziegfeld]]'' (1936), in which she played [[Billie Burke]] opposite Powell's [[Florenz Ziegfeld]]; the second Thin Man film, ''[[After the Thin Man]]'' (1936), with Powell and [[James Stewart]]; and the romantic comedy ''[[Double Wedding]]'' (1937).

While working for MGM, Loy was outspoken about the studio's casting hierarchy, especially based on [[race (human categorization)|race]], and was quoted as saying: \"Why does every black person in the movies have to play a servant?

Her role in ''The Thin Man'' helped elevate her reputation as a versatile actress, and she reprised the role of [[Nora Charles]] five more times.\n\nLoy's career began to slow in the 1940s, and she appeared in only a few films in the 1950s, including a lead role in the comedy ''[[Cheaper by the Dozen (1950 film)|Cheaper by the Dozen]]'' (1950), as well as supporting parts in ''[[The Ambassador's Daughter (1956 film)|The Ambassador's Daughter]]'' (1956) and the drama ''[[Lonelyhearts]]'' (1958). She appeared in only eight films between 1960 and 1981, after which she retired from acting.\n\nAlthough Loy was never nominated for an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]], in March 1991 she received an [[Academy Honorary Award|Honorary Academy Award]] in recognition of her life's work both onscreen and off, including serving as assistant to the director of military and naval welfare for the [[Red Cross]] during [[World War II]], and a member-at-large of the U.S. Commission to [[UNESCO]].

As a result, she became associated with musical roles, and when they began to lose favor with the public, her career went into a slump. In 1934, Loy appeared in ''[[Manhattan Melodrama]]'' with [[Clark Gable]] and [[William Powell]].
