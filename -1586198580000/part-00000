This is a primary variable because it limits maximum acceleration, controls steering response speed, and has some stability effects. Intuition suggests that we use a long wheelbase for high-speed stability, and a short wheelbase for quick turning in lower speed going. Actually, that works in the reverse; at high speeds, gyro effects slow the steering down, so we need a short wheelbase to make the bike steer. High-speed circuits require taller gearing, which prevents the bike from [[Wheelie|wheelying]] much even with the short wheelbase. On lower speed going, a longer wheelbase is useful to allow use of more acceleration without lifting the front wheel. This is why big-engined Sportbikes have longer wheelbases.<br>'''SINGLE PURPOSE SETUPS:'''<br>'''A.

This is a primary variable because it limits maximum acceleration, controls steering response speed, and has some stability effects. Intuition suggests that we use a long wheelbase for high-speed stability, and a short wheelbase for quick turning in lower speed going. Actually, that works in the reverse; at high speeds, gyro effects slow the steering down, so we need a short wheelbase to make the bike steer. High-speed circuits require taller gearing, which prevents the bike from [[Wheelie|wheelying]] much even with the short wheelbase. On lower speed going, a longer wheelbase is useful to allow use of more acceleration without lifting the front wheel. This is why big-engined Sportbikes have longer wheelbases.<br>'''SINGLE PURPOSE SETUPS:'''<br>'''A.

F & R tires are equal sizes to carry equal loads.<br>'''D.

Nonetheless, by present day standards in Europe, North America and the rest of the developed world, sport bikes are usually divided into three, four, or five rough categories, reflecting vaguely similar [[engine displacement]], [[horsepower]], price and intended use, with a good measure of subjective opinion and simplification.
