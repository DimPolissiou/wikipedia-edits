The Spanish built a [[Spanish Formosa|settlement in the north]] for a brief period but were driven out by the Dutch in 1642.\n\nIn 1662, [[Koxinga]], a loyalist of the [[Ming dynasty]] who had lost control of mainland China in 1644, defeated the Dutch and established a [[Kingdom of Tungning|base of operations]] on the island. His forces were defeated by the [[Qing dynasty]] in 1683, and parts of Taiwan became increasingly [[Taiwan under Qing rule|integrated into the Qing empire]]. Following the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] in 1895, the Qing [[1895 Japanese Conquest of Taiwan|ceded the island]], along with [[Penghu]], to the [[Empire of Japan]]. Taiwan produced rice and sugar to be exported to the Empire of Japan, and also served as a base for the [[South-East Asian theatre of World War II|Japanese invasion of Southeast Asia]] and [[Pacific War|the Pacific]] during World War II. [[Education in the Empire of Japan|Japanese imperial education]] was implemented in [[Taiwan]] and many Taiwanese also fought for Japan during the war.\n\nIn 1945, following the end of [[World War II]], the [[nationalist government]] of the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]] (ROC), led by the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT), took control of Taiwan. In 1949, after losing control of [[mainland China]] in the [[Chinese Civil War]], the ROC government under the KMT [[Chinese Nationalist Party retreat to Taiwan|withdrew to Taiwan]] and [[Chiang Kai-shek]] declared [[martial law]]. The KMT ruled Taiwan (along with the Islands of Kinmen, [[Wuqiu, Kinmen|Wuqiu]] and the Matsu on the opposite side of the [[Taiwan Strait]]) as a [[single-party state]] for forty years, until democratic reforms in the 1980s, which led to the first-ever [[1996 Republic of China presidential election|direct presidential election]] in 1996.

The first punitive expedition was against the villages of Baccloan and Mattauw, north of [[Fort Provintia|Saccam]] near Tayowan. The Mattauw campaign had been easier than expected and the tribe submitted after having their village razed by fire. The campaign also served as a threat to other villages from Tirossen (modern [[Chiayi]]) to Lonkjiaow ([[Hengchun]]). The [[Lamey Island Massacre|1636 punitive attack]] on [[Lamay Island]] in response to the killing of the shipwrecked crews of the ''Beverwijck'' and the ''Golden Lion'' ended ten years later with the entire aboriginal population of 1100 removed from the island including 327 Lamayans killed in a cave, having been trapped there by the Dutch and suffocated in the fumes and smoke pumped into the cave by the Dutch and their allied aborigines from Saccam, Soulang and Pangsoya.{{sfnp|Blusse|Everts|2000}} The men were forced into slavery in [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]] ([[Java]]) and the women and children became servants and wives for the Dutch officers.

Other parts of the deer were sold to Han traders for meat and medical use. The Dutch paid aborigines for the deer brought to them and tried to manage the deer stocks to keep up with demand. The Dutch also employed Han to farm [[sugarcane]] and rice for export. Some of these rice and sugarcane products reached as far as the markets of [[Persia]].

In response to raids by Zheng Jing and in an effort to starve out the forces in Taiwan, the Qing decreed to relocate all of the southern coastal towns and ports that had been the targets of raids by the Zheng fleet and thus provided supplies for the resistance. This measure largely backfired, and between 1662 and 1664, six major waves of immigration occurred from these coastal towns to Taiwan, spurred by the severe hardships incurred from the Qing relocation policy. In a move to take advantage of this Qing misstep, Zheng Jing promoted immigration to Taiwan by promising free eastern land cultivation and ownership for peasants in exchange for [[compulsory military service]] by all males in case the island was in danger of a Qing invasion.\n\n== Qing rule ==\n{{Main|Taiwan under Qing rule}}\n[[File:\u9e7f\u6e2f\u9f8d\u5c71\u5bfa\u5c71\u9580.jpg|thumb|right|Main gate of [[Lukang Longshan Temple]], built in 1786]]\n\n===Initial immigration restriction===\nIn 1683, following a naval engagement with Admiral [[Shi Lang]], one of Koxinga's father's trusted friends, Koxinga's grandson [[Zheng Keshuang]], surrendered to the [[Qing dynasty]].\n\nThere has been much confusion about Taiwan's association with the rumored \"Island of Dogs,\" \"Island of Women,\" etc., which were thought, by Han literati, to lie beyond the seas. Taiwan was officially regarded by the [[Kangxi Emperor]] as \"a ball of mud beyond the pale of civilization\" and did not appear on any map of the imperial domain until 1683.{{sfnp|Teng|2004|pp=34\u201359}} The act of presenting a map to the emperor was equal to presenting the lands of the empire. It took several more years before the Qing court would recognize Taiwan as part of the Qing realm. Prior to the Qing dynasty, China was conceived as a land [[Four Seas|bound by mountains, rivers and seas]]. The idea of an island as a part of China was unfathomable to the Han prior to the Qing frontier expansion effort of the 17th century.{{sfnp|Teng|2004|pp=34\u201349, 177\u2013179}}\n\nDespite the expense of the military and diplomatic campaign that brought Taiwan into the imperial realm, the general sentiment in [[Beijing]] was ambivalent. The point of the campaign had been to destroy the Zheng-family regime, not to conquer the island.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} The Kangxi Emperor expressed the sentiment that Taiwan was \"the size of a pellet; taking it is no gain; not taking it is no loss\" (\u5f48\u4e38\u4e4b\u5730\u3002\u5f97\u4e4b\u7121\u6240\u52a0\uff0c\u4e0d\u5f97\u7121\u6240\u640d).

The Koxinga reign had continued the tax systems of the Dutch, established schools and religious temples.\n\nFrom 1683, the [[Qing dynasty]] ruled the island as [[Taiwan Prefecture]] and in 1875 divided the island into two prefectures, north and south. In 1887, the island was declared as a separate [[Taiwan Province#Qing Dynasty|Fokien-Taiwan Province]].\n\nThe Qing authorities tried to limit immigration to Taiwan and barred families from traveling to Taiwan to ensure the immigrants would return to their families and ancestral graves. [[Illegal immigration]] continued, but many of the men had few prospects in war-weary Fujian and thus married locally, resulting in the idiom \"has [[Names of China#Tang|Tangshan]]{{efn|1=Tangshan means \"Chinese\".}} father, no Tangshan mother\" ({{zh|t=\u6709\u5510\u5c71\u516c\uff0c\u7121\u5510\u5c71\u5abd|poj=\u016a Tn\u0302g-soa\u207f kong, b\u00f4 Tn\u0302g-soa\u207f m\u00e1}}).<ref>{{holodict|60161}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Tai |first=Pao-tsun |title=The Concise History of Taiwan |edition=Chinese-English bilingual |year=2007 |publisher=Taiwan Historica |location=Nantou City |isbn=9789860109504 |page=52}}</ref> The Qing tried to protect aboriginal land claims, but also sought to turn them into tax paying subjects. Chinese and tax paying aborigines were barred from entering the wilderness which covered most of the island for the fear of raising the ire of the non taxpaying, highland aborigines and inciting [[rebellion]]. A border was constructed along the western plain, built using pits and mounds of earth, called \"earth cows\", to discourage [[squatting]].\n\n===Early Han settlers===\nFrom 1683 to around 1760, the Qing government limited immigration to Taiwan. Such restriction was relaxed following the 1760s and by 1811 there were more than two million Chinese immigrants on Taiwan. In 1875 [[Taipeh Prefecture]] was established, under the jurisdiction of Fujian Province. Also, there had been various conflicts between Chinese immigrants. Most conflicts were between Han from Fujian and Han from [[Guangdong]], between people from different areas of Fujian, between Han and [[Hakka people|Hakka]] settlers, or simply between people of different surnames engaged in clan feuds. Because of the strong provincial loyalties held by these immigrants, the Qing government felt Taiwan was somewhat difficult to govern. Taiwan was also plagued by foreign invasions.{{By whom|date=December 2018}}\n\nGiven the strategic and commercial value of Taiwan, there were British suggestions in 1840 and 1841 to seize the island.<ref name=\"Tsai2014\">{{cite book|author=Shih-Shan Henry Tsai|title=Maritime Taiwan: Historical Encounters with the East and the West|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vUbfBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA66|date=2009|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-46517-1|pages=66\u201367}}</ref><ref name=\"Gordon2009\">{{cite book|author=Leonard H.

The brig ''Ann'' also became shipwrecked in March 1842. Most of the crew were Indian [[lascar]]s. Survivors from both ships were transferred by authorities to the capital [[Tainan]]. The Taiwan Qing commanders, Ta-hung-ah and Yao Ying, filed a disingenuous report to the emperor, claiming to have defended against an attack from the Keelung fort. In October 1841, [[HMS Nimrod (1828)|HMS ''Nimrod'']] sailed to Keelung to search for the ''Nerbudda'' survivors, but after Captain Joseph Pearse found out that they were sent south for imprisonment, he ordered the bombardment of the harbour and destroyed 27 sets of cannon before returning to Hong Kong. Most of the survivors\u2014over 130 from the ''Nerbudda'' and 54 from the ''Ann''\u2014were [[Nerbudda incident|executed in Tainan]] in August 1842.<ref name=\"Tsai2014\" />\n\nThe Aboriginals often slaughtered the shipwrecked crews of Western ships. In 1867 the entire American crew of the ''Rover'' were massacred by aboriginals in the [[Rover incident|''Rover'' incident]]. When the Americans launched the punitive [[Formosa Expedition]] in retaliation, the aboriginals defeated the Americans and forced them to retreat, killing an American marine while suffering no casualties themselves.\n\nDuring the [[Sino-French War]], the French attempted an invasion of Taiwan during the [[Keelung Campaign]] in 1884. [[Liu Mingchuan]], who was leading the defense of Taiwan, recruited Aboriginals to serve alongside the Chinese soldiers in fighting against the French. The French were defeated at the [[Battle of Tamsui]] and the Qing forces pinned the French down at Keelung in an eight-month-long campaign before the French withdrew. Because of these incursions, the Qing government began constructing a series of coastal defenses and in 1885, work commenced to make Taiwan a province, with Liu Mingchuan serving as the first governor. He divided Taiwan into eleven counties and tried to improve relations with the aborigines. He also developed a railway from [[Taipei]] to [[Hsinchu]], established a mine in Keelung, and built an arsenal to improve Taiwan's defensive capability against foreigners.\n\nFollowing a shipwreck of a [[Ryukyu Kingdom|Ryukyuan]] vessel on the southeastern tip of Taiwan in winter of 1871, in which the heads of 54 crew members were taken by the aboriginal Taiwanese [[Paiwan people]] in the [[Mudan incident (1871)|Mudan incident]], the Japanese sought to use this incident as a pretext to have the Qing formally acknowledge Japanese sovereignty over the [[Ryukyu Islands]] as Japanese territory and to test reactions to potential expansion into Taiwan. According to records from Japanese documents, {{Interlanguage link multi|Mao Changxi|zh|3=\u6bdb\u6636\u7199}} and {{Interlanguage link multi|Dong Xun|zh|3=\u8463\u6042}}, the [[Qing]] ministers at [[Zongli Yamen]] who handled the complaints from Japanese envoy {{Interlanguage link multi|Yanagihara Sakimitsu|ja|3=\u67f3\u539f\u524d\u5149}}, replied first that they had heard only of a massacre of Ryukyuans, not of Japanese, and quickly noted that Ryukyu was under [[List of tributaries of Imperial China|Chinese suzerainty]], and therefore this issue was not Japan's business. In addition, the governor-general of the Qing province [[Fujian]] had rescued the survivors of the massacre and returned them safely to Ryukyu. The Qing authorities explained that there were two kinds of aborigines on Taiwan: those governed by the Qing, and those unnaturalized \"raw barbarians&nbsp;... beyond the reach of Qing government and customs.\" They indirectly hinted that foreigners traveling in those areas settled by indigenous people must exercise caution.\n\nAfter the Yanagihara-Yamen interview, the Japanese took their explanation to mean that the Qing government had not opposed Japan's claims to sovereignty over the Ryukyu Islands, disclaimed any jurisdiction over Aboriginal Taiwanese, and had indeed consented to Japan's expedition to Taiwan.{{sfnp|Leung|1983|p=270}} The Qing dynasty made it clear to the Japanese that Taiwan was definitely within Qing jurisdiction, even though part of that island's aboriginal population was not yet under the influence of Chinese culture. The Qing also pointed to similar cases all over the world where an aboriginal population within a national boundary was not completely [[Subjugated mentality|subjugated]] by the [[dominant culture]] of that country.\n\nThe Japanese nevertheless launched [[Taiwan Expedition of 1874|an expedition]] to Mutan village with a force of 3600 soldiers in 1874. The number of killed [[Paiwan people|Paiwan]] was about thirty, and that for the Japanese was six. Eventually, the Japanese withdrew after being paid a massive [[indemnity]] by the Qing. This incident caused the Qing to re-think the importance of Taiwan in their maritime defense strategy and greater importance was placed on gaining control over the wilderness regions.\n\nOn the eve of the [[First Sino-Japanese War]], about 45 percent of the island was administered under direct Qing administration while the remaining was lightly populated by [[Taiwanese aborigines|Aborigines]].{{sfnp|Morris|2002|pp=5\u20136}} In a population of around 2.5 million, about 2.3 million were [[Han Chinese]] and the remaining two hundred thousand were classified as members of various indigenous tribes.\n\n===End of Qing Rule===\n[[Image:1896 map of Taiwan.png|thumb|250px|1896 map of Formosa, revised by Rev.

Some were goaded by [[Chinese nationalism]], while others contained nascent Taiwanese self-determination.{{sfnp|Zhang|1998|p=514}} Rebellions were often caused by a combination of the effects of unequal colonial policies on local elites and extant [[Millenarianism|millenarian]] beliefs of the local Taiwanese and plains Aborigines. Aboriginal resistance to the heavy-handed Japanese policies of acculturation and pacification lasted up until the early 1930s.{{sfnp|Katz|2005}} The last major Aboriginal rebellion, the [[Musha Incident|Musha (Wushe) Uprising]] in late 1930 by the [[Atayal people]] angry over their treatment while laboring in the burdensome job of [[camphor]] extraction, launched the last headhunting party in which over 150 Japanese officials were killed and beheaded during the opening ceremonies of a school.

The second group of Taiwanese were eager to become imperial subjects, believing that such action would lead to equal status with Japanese nationals. The third group was influenced by [[Taiwan independence]] and tried to get rid of the Japanese colonials to establish a native Taiwanese rule. The fourth group on the other hand were influenced by [[Chinese nationalism]] and fought for the return of Taiwan to Chinese rule. From 1897 onwards, this last group staged many rebellions, the most famous one being led by {{Interlanguage link multi|Luo Fuxing|zh|3=\u7f85\u798f\u661f}}, who was arrested and executed along with two hundred of his comrades in 1913. Luo himself was a member of the [[Tongmenghui]], an organization founded by [[Sun Yat-sen]] and was the precursor to the [[Kuomintang]].{{sfnp|Zhang|1998|p=515}} Several strategies of resistance were undertaken.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://scholarworks.umass.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1095&context=theses |title= The turtle woman's voices: Multilingual strategies of resistance and assimilation in Taiwan under Japanese colonial rule |author= HUANG-WEN LAI|date=2015 |format=pdf published=2007|accessdate=11 November 2015 |pages=113|citation= }}</ref>\n\n===Modern development===\n[[Image:Bank of Taiwan Head Office Building 1940.jpg|thumb|left|Bank of Taiwan established in 1897 headquartered in Taihoku (Taipei).]]\nInitial infrastructural development took place quickly. The [[Bank of Taiwan]] was established in 1899 to encourage Japanese [[private sector]]s, including [[Mitsubishi]] and the [[Mitsui|Mitsui Group]], to invest in Taiwan. In 1900, the third [[Governor-General of Taiwan]] passed a budget which initiated the building of [[Rail transport in Taiwan|Taiwan's railroad system]] from Kirun ([[Keelung]]) to Takao ([[Kaohsiung]]). By 1905 the island had electric power supplied by water power in [[Sun-Moon Lake]], and in subsequent years Taiwan was considered the second-most developed region of East Asia (after Japan). By 1905, Taiwan was financially self-sufficient and had been weaned off of subsidies from Japan's central government.\n\nUnder the governor [[Shimpei Goto]]'s rule, many major public works projects were completed. The [[Rail transport in Taiwan|Taiwan rail system]] connecting the south and the north and the modernizations of Kirun ([[Keelung]]) and Takao ([[Kaohsiung]]) ports were completed to facilitate transport and shipping of raw material and agricultural products.{{sfnp|Takekoshi|1907}} Exports increased by fourfold. 55% of agricultural land was covered by dam-supported [[irrigation]] systems. Food production had increased fourfold and [[Sugarcane|sugar cane]] production had increased 15-fold between 1895 and 1925 and Taiwan became a major foodbasket serving Japan's industrial economy. A health care system was widely established and [[infectious diseases]] were almost completely eradicated. The average lifespan for a Taiwanese resident would become 60 years by 1945.{{sfnp|Kerr|1966}}\n\n[[File:Chiayi City Historical Relic Museum 20060121.jpg|thumb|right|[[Kagi Shrine]], one of many Shinto shrines built in Taiwan.]]\nIn October 1935, the Governor-General of Taiwan held an \"[[The Taiwan Exposition: In Commemoration of the First Forty Years of Colonial Rule|Exposition to Commemorate the 40th Anniversary of the Beginning of Administration in Taiwan]]\", which served as a showcase for the achievements of Taiwan's modernization process under Japanese rule. This attracted worldwide attention, including the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]]'s [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) regime which sent the Japanese-educated [[Chen Yi (Kuomintang)|Chen Yi]] to attend the affair. He expressed his admiration about the efficiency of Japanese government in developing Taiwan, and commented on how lucky the Taiwanese were to live under such effective administration. Somewhat ironically, Chen Yi would later become the ROC's first Chief Executive of Taiwan, who would be infamous for the corruption that occurred under his watch.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nThe later period of Japanese rule saw a local elite educated and organized. During the 1930s several home rule groups were created at a time when others around the world sought to end colonialism. In 1935, the Taiwanese elected their first group of local legislators. By March 1945, the Japanese legislative branch hastily modified election laws to allow Taiwanese representation in the [[Japanese Diet]].{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n===World War II===\n[[File:Takasago Volunteer Corps.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Takasago Volunteers]] were a unit of the Japanese Army recruited from Taiwanese aboriginal tribes.]]\nAs Japan embarked on [[Japanese invasion of China|full-scale war in China]] in 1937, it expanded Taiwan's industrial capacity to manufacture war material. By 1939, industrial production had exceeded agricultural production in Taiwan. At the same time, the \"[[K\u014dminka movement (Taiwan)|''k\u014dminka'']]\" imperialization project was put under way to instill the \"Japanese Spirit\" in Taiwanese residents, and ensure the Taiwanese would remain loyal subjects of the Japanese Emperor ready to make sacrifices during wartime. Measures including Japanese-language education, the option of adopting Japanese names, and the worship of Japanese religion were instituted. In 1943, 94% of the children received 6-year compulsory education. From 1937 to 1945, 126,750 Taiwanese joined and served in the [[Imperial Japanese Army|military of the Japanese Empire]], while a further 80,433 were conscripted between 1942 and 1945. Of the sum total, 30,304, or 15%, died in [[Japan in World War II|Japan's war in Asia]].\n\nThe [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] operated heavily out of Taiwan. The \"[[The Japanese Navy Taiwan and South Pacific Mandate political project|South Strike Group]]\" was based out of the [[Taihoku Imperial University]] (now National Taiwan University) in Taiwan. Many of the Japanese forces participating in the [[Aerial Battle of Taiwan-Okinawa]] were based in Taiwan. Important Japanese military bases and industrial centers throughout Taiwan, like [[Takao, Taiwan|Takao]] (now Kaohsiung), were targets of heavy American bombing.\n\nIn 1942, after the United States entered the war against Japan and on the side of China, the Chinese government under the [[KMT]] renounced all treaties signed with Japan before that date and made Taiwan's return to China (as with [[Manchuria]], ruled as the Japanese [[Puppet States of WWII|wartime puppet state]] of \"[[Manchukuo]]\") one of the wartime objectives. In the [[1943 Cairo Declaration|Cairo Declaration]] of 1943, the [[Allies of World War II|Allied Powers]] declared the return of [[Taiwan (island)|Taiwan]] (including the [[Pescadores]]) to the Republic of China as one of several Allied demands. In 1945, Japan unconditionally surrendered with signing of the [[Japanese Instrument of Surrender|instrument of surrender]] and ended its rule in Taiwan as the territory was put under the administrative control of the Republic of China government in 1945 by the [[United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration]].<ref name=\"unhcr.org\">{{cite web |url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country,,,,TWN,,4954ce6323,0.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728144641/http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country,,,,TWN,,4954ce6323,0.html |archivedate=2011-07-28 }} UNHCR</ref><ref>{{cite news\n|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2013/06/09/2003564336\n|title=CIA report shows Taiwan concerns\n|work=Taipei Times |date=9 Jun 2013 |page=1 |last=Lowther |first=William\n|quote=[Quoting from a declassified CIA report on Taiwan written in March 1949] From the legal standpoint, Taiwan is not part of the Republic of China.

Anti-[[Mainland Chinese|mainlander]] violence flared on February 28, 1947, prompted by an incident in which a cigarette seller was injured and a passerby was indiscriminately shot dead by Nationalist authorities.{{sfnp|Kerr|1966|pp=254\u2013255}} During the ensuing crackdown by the KMT administration in what became known as the [[February 28 Incident]], tens of thousands of people were killed or arrested, and the incident became a [[taboo]] topic of discussion for the entire [[martial law]] era.\n\nFrom the 1930s onward the [[Chinese Civil War]] was underway in mainland China between [[Chiang Kai-shek]]'s ROC government and the [[Communist Party of China]] led by [[Mao Zedong]]. When the Communists gained complete control of Mainland China in 1949, two million refugees, predominantly from the Nationalist government, military, and business community, [[Chinese Nationalist Party retreat to Taiwan|fled to Taiwan]]. On October 1, 1949 the [[People's Republic of China]] (P.R.C.) was founded in mainland China by the victorious communists; several months before, Chiang Kai-shek had established a provisional ROC capital in [[Taipei]] and moved his government there from [[Nanjing]]. Under Nationalist rule, the mainlanders dominated the government and civil services.{{sfnp|Gates|1981}}\n\n{{See also|Chinese Nationalist Party retreat to Taiwan}}\n\n===Economic development===\n[[Image:Taiwan-1M-Yuan.jpg|thumb|80px|The [[Chinese Civil War]] led to severe inflation.

This gave way to the reconstruction process and new reforms.\n\nThe KMT took control of Taiwan's monopolies that had been owned by the Japanese prior to World War II. They nationalized approximately 17% of Taiwan's [[GNP]] and voided Japanese bond certificates held by Taiwanese investors.{{sfnp|Singh|2010|p=50}} These real estate holdings as well as American aid such as the [[China Aid Act]] and the [[Sino-American Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction]] helped to ensure that Taiwan would recover quickly from war. The Kuomintang government also moved the entire [[official gold reserves|gold reserve]] from the Chinese mainland to Taiwan,{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} and used this reserve to back the newly issued [[New Taiwan dollar]] to stabilize the new currency and put a stop to [[hyperinflation]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Li|first=Shih-hui|date=2005|title=The Currency Conversion in Postwar Taiwan: Gold Standard from 1949 to 1950|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/43213319|journal=The Kyoto Economic Review|volume=74|issue=2 (157)|pages=191\u2013203|issn=1349-6786}}</ref>\n\nThe KMT authorities implemented a far-reaching and highly successful [[land reform]] program on Taiwan during the 1950s. The [[375 Rent Reduction Act]] alleviated tax burden on peasants and another act redistributed land among small farmers and compensated large landowners with commodities certificates and stock in state-owned industries. Although this left some large landowners impoverished, others turned their compensation into capital and started commercial and industrial enterprises. These entrepreneurs were to become Taiwan's first [[Industrial capitalism|industrial capitalists]]. Together with businessmen who fled from mainland China, they once again revived Taiwan's prosperity previously ceased along with Japanese withdrawal and managed Taiwan's transition from an agricultural to a commercial, industrial economy.\n\nFrom 1950 to 1965, Taiwan received a total of $1.5 billion in economic aid and $2.4 billion in military aid from the United States. In 1965 all American aid ceased when Taiwan had established a solid financial base.{{sfnp|Chan|1997}} Having accomplished that, [[President of the Republic of China|ROC president]] [[Chiang Ching-kuo]]<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://taiwanpedia.culture.tw/en/content?ID=3933 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-07-19 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130419042325/http://taiwanpedia.culture.tw/en/content?ID=3933 |archive-date=2013-04-19 |url-status=dead }}</ref> (the son of [[Chiang Kai-shek]]) started state projects such as the [[Ten Major Construction Projects]] that provided the infrastructure for building a strong export-driven economy. Taiwan has developed steadily into a major international trading power with more than $218 billion in two-way trade and one of the highest [[foreign exchange reserves]] in the world. Tremendous prosperity on the island was accompanied by economic and social stability. Taiwan's phenomenal economic development earned it a spot as one of the [[Four Asian Tigers]].\n\n=== Democratic reforms ===\nUntil the early 1970s, the Republic of China was recognized as the sole legitimate government of China by the United Nations and most Western nations; who refused to recognize the [[People's Republic of China]] on account of the [[Cold War]]. The KMT ruled Taiwan under [[martial law]] until the late 1980s, with the stated goal of being vigilant against Communist infiltration and preparing to retake mainland China. Therefore, political dissent was not tolerated.\n\nThe late 1970s and early 1980s were a turbulent time for Chinese people born in Taiwan, as many of the people who had originally been oppressed and left behind by economic changes became members of the Taiwan's new middle class. Free enterprise had allowed native Taiwanese to gain a powerful bargaining chip in their demands for respect for their basic human rights. The [[Kaohsiung Incident]] would be a major turning point for democracy in Taiwan.\n\nTaiwan also faced setbacks in the international sphere. In 1971, the ROC government walked out of the United Nations shortly before it recognized the PRC government in Beijing as the legitimate holder of China's seat in the United Nations. The ROC had been offered dual representation,{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} but Chiang Kai-shek demanded to retain a seat on the [[United Nations Security Council|UN Security Council]], which was not acceptable to the PRC.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} Chiang expressed his decision in his famous \"[[the sky is not big enough for two suns]]\" speech.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018|reason=Text of this speech should be linked}} In October 1971, [[China and the United Nations|Resolution 2758]] was passed by the UN General Assembly and \"the representatives of Chiang Kai-shek\" (and thus the ROC) were expelled from the UN and replaced as \"China\" by the PRC. In 1979, the United States switched recognition from Taipei to Beijing.\n\nChiang Kai-shek died in April 1975, and was succeeded to the presidency by [[Yen Chia-kan]] while his son [[Chiang Ching-kuo]] succeeded to the leadership of the Kuomintang (opting to take the title \"Chairman\" rather than the elder Chiang's title of \"Director-General\"). Formerly the head of the feared [[secret police]], Chiang Ching-kuo recognized gaining foreign support to securing the ROC's future security required reform. His administration saw a gradual loosening of political controls, a transition towards democracy, and moves toward [[Taiwanization]] of the regime.{{sfnp|Hu|2005|pp=26\u201327}} Opponents of the Nationalists were no longer forbidden to hold meetings or publish papers. Though opposition political parties were still illegal, when the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] was established as the first opposition party in 1986, President Chiang decided against dissolving the group or persecuting its leaders. Its candidates officially ran in elections as independents in the [[Tangwai movement]]. In the following year, Chiang ended martial law and allowed family visits to [[mainland China]].{{sfnp|Hu|2005|pp=32\u201343}} Chiang selected [[Lee Teng-hui]], a Taiwan born technocrat to be his vice president; the first in the line of succession to the presidency. The move followed other reforms giving more power to native born citizens and calmed anti-KMT sentiments.{{sfnp|Hu|2005|pp=33\u201334}}\n\nAfter Chiang Ching-kuo died in 1988, his successor, President [[Lee Teng-hui]], continued to democratize the government. Lee transferred more government authority to Taiwanese born citizens, and Taiwan underwent a process of [[Taiwanization]]. In this localization process, local culture and history was promoted over a pan-China viewpoint. Lee's reforms included printing banknotes from the Central Bank instead of the usual Provincial Bank of Taiwan. He also largely suspended the operation of the [[Taiwan Provincial Government]]. In 1991 the [[Legislative Yuan]] and [[National Assembly (Republic of China)|National Assembly]] elected in 1947 were forced to resign. These groups were originally created to represent mainland China constituencies. The restrictions on the use of [[Languages of Taiwan|Taiwanese languages]] in the broadcast media and in schools were also lifted.\n\nHowever, Lee failed to crack down on the massive corruption that pervaded the government and many KMT loyalists felt that Lee betrayed the ROC by taking reforms too far, while those in the opposition felt he did not take reforms far enough.\n\n===Democratic period===\nLee ran as the incumbent in Taiwan's first direct [[1996 Republic of China presidential election|presidential election in 1996]] against DPP candidate and former dissident, Peng Min-ming. This election prompted the PRC to conduct a series of missile tests in the [[Taiwan Strait]] to intimidate the Taiwanese electorate so that electorates would vote for other pro-unification candidates, [[Chen Li-an]] and [[Lin Yang-kang]]. The aggressive tactic prompted U.S. President [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]] to invoke the [[Taiwan Relations Act]] and dispatch two aircraft carrier battle groups into the region off Taiwan's southern coast to monitor the situation, and PRC's missile tests were forced to end earlier than planned. This incident is known as the [[Third Taiwan Strait Crisis|1996 Taiwan Straits Crisis]].{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nOne of Lee's final acts as president was to declare on German radio that the ROC and the PRC have a [[Special state-to-state relations|special state to state relationship]]. Lee's statement was met with the PRC's People's Army conducting military drills in Fujian and a frightening island-wide [[Power outage|blackout]] in Taiwan, causing many to fear an attack or cyberattack.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nThe [[2000 ROC presidential election|2000 presidential election]] marked the end of the Kuomintang (KMT) rule. DPP candidate [[Chen Shui-bian]] won a three-way race that saw the [[Pan-Blue]] vote split by independent [[James Soong]] (formerly of the Kuomintang) and Kuomintang candidate [[Lien Chan]]. Chen garnered 39% of the vote.<ref>Asia Society, \"Opposition Wins Taiwan Election,\" (2000)</ref> After the election, Soong formed the [[People First Party (Republic of China)|People First Party]] (PFP).{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\n[[2004 Taiwan presidential election|In 2004]], President Chen was re-elected to a second four-year term after an assassination attempt which occurred the day before the election. Two shots were fired, with one bullet grazing the President's belly after penetrating the windshield of a jeep and several layers of clothing and the other bullet penetrated the windshield and hitting the vice president's knee cast. (She was wearing a knee cast due to an earlier injury.) Police investigators have said that the most likely suspect is believed to have been [[Chen Yi-hsiung]], who was later found dead.<ref>Reuters, \"Taiwan election shooting suspect dead,\" (2005)</ref> Their injuries were not life-threatening, but the incident is believed by Pan-Blue to have gained them enough sympathy to influence the result.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nThat incident might also have given president Chen the ability to declare a state of emergency and martial law, which allegedly prevented the police and military, which were strongly Pan-Blue,{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} from voting. Lien refused to concede, alleging voting irregularities. Kuomintang and PFP supporters held mass protests throughout the following weeks. Subsequently, Kuomintang and PFP took the case to the court. The [[High Court of Taiwan|High Court]] ordered a recount and found no evidence to support the accusation made by Kuomintang and PFP. The Court decided that the election result was legitimate and valid.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nDuring the [[2004 Taiwan legislative election|legislative elections]] held on December 8, 2004, the Kuomintang-PFP dominated Pan-Blue alliance gained a slim majority in the elections which resulted in President Chen resigning as DPP chairman. The cabinet of Premier [[Yu Shyi-kun]] resigned, and [[Frank Hsieh]] assumed premiership on January 25, 2005.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nIn a move that some{{Who|date=December 2018}} saw as a reaction to Chen's re-election, the People's Republic of China enacted a proposed [[National Unification Promotion Law of the People's Republic of China (proposed)|anti-secession law]] that allows the [[use of force]] on Taiwan and the Republic of China government if it formally declares independence. However, this law was met with overwhelming protest from nearly all political parties and public figures of the Republic of China and disapproval from the western countries. Negotiations in January in [[Macau]] between the aviation authorities from both the Republic of China and People's Republic of China resulted in direct [[Cross-Strait charter|cross-strait charter flights]] between mainland China and Taiwan during the [[Chinese New Year|Chinese Lunar New Year]] Period.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nIn a twist of events, President Chen and PFP Chairman Soong held a summit and the independence-leaning president indicated that eventual [[Chinese unification|reunification with mainland China]] would be an option. Against the anti-secession law proposed by the People's Republic of China, President Chen held a video conference with the [[European Parliament]] in [[Brussels]] urging the [[European Union]] not to lift the arms embargo on the People's Republic of China.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nDomestic politics during the Chen administration were largely a political stalemate as the Kuomintang and PFP together held a pan-Blue majority in the legislature. Among the many items that made little progress due to the political stalemate were a stalled arms procurement bill, which would have advanced defense capabilities of the Republic of China through the purchase of weaponry, such as sub-hunting [[P-3 Orion]]s, from the US government, and banking reform legislation, which would have helped in the consolidation of the many banks in the Republic of China, none of which hold even 10% shares of the local market. The [[president of the Republic of China]], unlike the president of the United States, does not wield [[veto power]], providing him with little to no leverage in negotiating with an opposition legislature, regardless of how slim the majority.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nThe constitution was [[Additional Articles of the Constitution of the Republic of China|further amended]] in 2005, creating a two-vote electoral system, with [[single member plurality]] seats and [[proportional representation|proportional representative]] seats, and abolishing the National Assembly, transferring most of its former powers to the [[Legislative Yuan]], and leaving further amendment voting to public referendums. The issue of formally declaring the [[Taiwan independence|independence of Taiwan]] is also a constant constitutional question. Arms purchases from the United States are still a controversial political question, with the [[Pan-Green Coalition]] camp favoring the purchase, and the [[Pan-Blue Coalition]] opposing it.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n\nRecent allegations about [[political corruption|corruption]] inside the [[First Family]] had led to three [[Recall election|recall motions]] votes in the [[Legislative Yuan]] aimed at ousting President [[Chen Shui-bian]]. All of them had failed since the Pan-Blue Coalition lacked the [[two-thirds majority]] required to complete the process and the [[political parties]] voted according to political lines. The [[First Lady]], [[Wu Shu-chen]] was prosecuted for corruption, namely illegally using state funds for personal reasons.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nThe president faced similar accusations as his wife, but was protected from prosecution by presidential [[Legal immunity|immunity]]. He had promised to resign if his wife was found guilty. However, after his wife fainted in the preparation hearing, she had sought and obtained absence of leave from the Court 16 times citing health concerns before President Chen Shui-bian's term was complete.<ref>[http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/national/national%20news/2008/09/18/175153/Former-first.htm Former first lady Wu to appear in court], ''China Post''</ref>\n\nIn December 2006, municipal and mayoral elections were held in [[Taipei]] and [[Kaohsiung]]. The [[KMT]] retained a clear majority in the capital, while the [[Democratic Progressive Party|DPP]] and the KMT obtained very close results in the southern city of [[Kaohsiung]]. [[Huang Chun-ying]] lost to [[Chen Chu]] by a margin of 0.14 percent; 378,303 votes to 379,417 votes, making [[Chen Chu]] the first female mayor of a [[Special municipality (Taiwan)|special municipality]] in the Republic of China. In 2007, the ROC applied for membership in the United Nations under the name \"Taiwan\", and was rejected by the General Assembly.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nIn 2007, President Chen proposed a policy of [[Four Wants and One Without]], which in substance states that Taiwan wants independence; Taiwan wants the rectification of its name; Taiwan wants a new constitution; Taiwan wants development; and Taiwanese politics is without [[Left\u2013right political spectrum|the question of left or right]], but only the question of [[Chinese unification|unification]] or [[Taiwan independence movement|independence]]. The reception of this proposed policy in Taiwanese general public was unclear. It, however, was met with a cold reception by both the PRC and the United States. The PRC Foreign Minister emphasised that the [[Anti-Secession Law]] was not a piece of [[Unenforceable|unenforceable legislation]], while the US Department of State spokesman Sean McCormack described Chen's policy as \"unhelpful\".<ref>{{cite web | title=US Says Taiwanese President's Independence Remarks 'Unhelpful'|date=2007-03-05 | publisher=Voice of America | url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/taiwan/2007/taiwan-070305-voa02.htm}}</ref>\n\nThe KMT also retained control of the legislature in the [[2008 Republic of China legislative election|Legislative Yuan elections in January 2008]]. In the [[2008 Republic of China presidential election|presidential election in May 2008]], KMT candidate [[Ma Ying-jeou]] ran on a platform supporting friendlier relations with mainland China and economic reforms, and defeated DPP candidate [[Frank Hsieh]] with 58.48% of the vote.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nOn the same day President Chen left office, losing presidential immunity, the Supreme Prosecutor's Office announced that they were launching an inquiry into corruption charges regarding Chen.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7409956.stm Taiwan ex-leader faces graft case]</ref> Later in 2008, members of his administration, including [[Chiou I-jen]], a former National Security Council secretary-general, and Yeh Sheng-mao, former director-general of the Ministry of Justice's Investigation Bureau, were arrested on [[Chen Shui-bian corruption charges|corruption charges]].

In the end, the government agreed to put on hold the ratification of an agreement with China which they had pushed through without proper debate. This event had far reaching consequences, and changed the mood of the electorate. In the [[2016 Republic of China general election|combined elections in January 2016]] the opposition candidate for President, [[Tsai Ing-wen]], of the DPP won with 56% of the vote, and the opposition DPP was catapulted into an outright majority in the parliament. The election marked the first time a non-KMT party won a majority in the legislature.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nThe elections held on November 24, 2018 resulted in a major setback for the DPP majority and led to President [[Tsai Ing-wen]] resignation as leader of the party.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Bush |first1=Richard C. |title=Taiwan\u2019s local elections, explained |url=https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2018/12/05/taiwans-local-elections-explained/ |website=Brookings |publisher=[[Brookings Institutution]] |accessdate=8 December 2018 |date=5 December 2018}}</ref> The DPP lost a total of nine legislative seats, giving the KMT control of the majority of the 22 seats.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Hsiao |first1=Russell |title=The Global Taiwan Brief Volume 3, Issue 23 |url=http://globaltaiwan.org/2018/11/vol-3-issue-23/#KharisTempleman11282018 |website=Global Taiwan Institute |publisher=Global Taiwan Institute |date=28 November 2018}}</ref> KMT mayoral candidates won in [[New Taipei City]], [[Taichung]] and [[Kaohsiung]], the latter of which has been a political stronghold for the DPP for 20 years.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Horton |first1=Chris |title=Taiwan\u2019s President Quits as Party Chief After Stinging Losses in Local Races |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/24/world/asia/taiwan-election-results.html |website=The New York Times |publisher=The New York Times |accessdate=8 December 2018 |date=24 November 2018}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Geography of Taiwan]]\n* [[Timeline of Taiwanese history]]\n* [[Economic history of Taiwan]]\n* [[Taiwanese indigenous peoples]]\n* [[Han Taiwanese]]\n* [[Foreign relations of the Republic of China]]\n* [[History of Asia]], [[History of East Asia|East Asia]], [[History of China|China]], & [[History of Japan|Japan]]\n* [[Japanese expansionism]] & [[Japanese opium policy in Taiwan (1895\u20131945)|Taiwanese opium policy]]\n* [[Dutch Empire]]\n* ''[[Understanding Taiwan]]''\n* [[Military dependents' village]]\n* [[Politics of the Republic of China]]\n* [[Political status of Taiwan]]\n* [[Taiwan independence movement]] & [[Chinese unification]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{citation | last1=Bird | first1=Michael I. | last2=Hope | first2=Geoffrey | last3=Taylor | first3=David | title=Populating PEP II: the dispersal of humans and agriculture through Austral-Asia and Oceania | journal=Quaternary International | year=2004 | volume=118\u2013119 | pages=145\u2013163 | doi=10.1016/s1040-6182(03)00135-6 | url=http://palaeoworks.anu.edu.au/pubs/Birdetal04.pdf | postscript=. | access-date=2007-04-12 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140212013511/http://palaeoworks.anu.edu.au/pubs/Birdetal04.pdf | archive-date=2014-02-12 | url-status=dead }}\n* {{citation\n  | last=Blusse | first=Leonard\n  | last2=Everts | first2=Natalie | year=2000\n  | title=The Formosan Encounter: Notes on Formosa's Aboriginal Society \u2013 A selection of Documents from Dutch Archival Sources Vol. I & II\n  | publisher=[[Shung Ye Museum of Formosan Aborigines]] | place=Taipei\n  | isbn=957-99767-2-4\n}} and {{ISBN|957-99767-7-5}}.\n* {{citation\n  | last=Blust | first=Robert | authorlink=Robert Blust\n  | year=1999\n  | title=Selected papers from the Eighth International Conference on Austronesian Linguistics\n  | contribution=Subgrouping, circularity and extinction: some issues in Austronesian comparative linguistics\n  | editor1=E.

The Spanish built a [[Spanish Formosa|settlement in the north]] for a brief period but were driven out by the Dutch in 1642.\n\nIn 1662, [[Koxinga]], a loyalist of the [[Ming dynasty]] who had lost control of mainland China in 1644, defeated the Dutch and established a [[Kingdom of Tungning|base of operations]] on the island. His forces were defeated by the [[Qing dynasty]] in 1683, and parts of Taiwan became increasingly [[Taiwan under Qing rule|integrated into the Qing empire]]. Following the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] in 1895, the Qing [[1895 Japanese Conquest of Taiwan|ceded the island]], along with [[Penghu]], to the [[Empire of Japan]]. Taiwan produced rice and sugar to be exported to the Empire of Japan, and also served as a base for the [[South-East Asian theatre of World War II|Japanese invasion of Southeast Asia]] and [[Pacific War|the Pacific]] during World War II. [[Education in the Empire of Japan|Japanese imperial education]] was implemented in [[Taiwan]] and many Taiwanese also fought for Japan during the war.\n\nIn 1945, following the end of [[World War II]], the [[nationalist government]] of the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]] (ROC), led by the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT), took control of Taiwan. In 1949, after losing control of [[mainland China]] in the [[Chinese Civil War]], the ROC government under the KMT [[Chinese Nationalist Party retreat to Taiwan|withdrew to Taiwan]] and [[Chiang Kai-shek]] declared [[martial law]]. The KMT ruled Taiwan (along with the Islands of Kinmen, [[Wuqiu, Kinmen|Wuqiu]] and the Matsu on the opposite side of the [[Taiwan Strait]]) as a [[single-party state]] for forty years, until democratic reforms in the 1980s, which led to the first-ever [[1996 Republic of China presidential election|direct presidential election]] in 1996. During the post-war period, Taiwan experienced rapid industrialization and economic growth known as the \"[[Taiwan Miracle]]\", and was known as one of the \"[[Four Asian Tigers]]\".\n\n==From prehistory until the 16th century==\n{{Main|Prehistory of Taiwan}}\n{{location map+|Taiwan|caption=Taiwan, with early sites, and the {{convert|abbr=on|130|km|mi|adj=mid|-wide|0}} Taiwan Strait|AlternativeMap=Taiwan relief location map.png|width=200|float=right|places=\n  {{location map~|Taiwan|lat_deg=26.338889|lon_deg=120.22|position=bottom|label_size=75|mark=Brown pog.svg|label=Liang Island}}\n  {{location map~|Taiwan|lat_deg=23.02|lon_deg=120.42|position=left|label_size=75|mark=Brown pog.svg|label=Zuojhen}}\n  {{location map~|Taiwan|lat_deg=23.32|lon_deg=121.45|position=bottom|label_size=75|mark=Brown pog.svg|label=Changbin}}\n  {{location map~|Taiwan|lat_deg=21.9|lon_deg=120.85|position=right|label_size=75|mark=Brown pog.svg|label=Eluanbi}}\n  {{location map~|Taiwan|lat_deg=25.15|lon_deg=121.4|position=top|label_size=75|mark=Orange pog.svg|label=Dapenkeng}}\n}}\nIn the [[Late Pleistocene]], sea levels were about 140 m lower than in the present day, exposing the floor of the shallow [[Taiwan Strait]] as a land bridge that was crossed by mainland fauna.{{sfnp|Chang|1989}} The oldest evidence of human presence on Taiwan consists of three cranial fragments and a molar tooth found at Chouqu and Gangzilin, in [[Zuojhen District]], Tainan.

This measure largely backfired, and between 1662 and 1664, six major waves of immigration occurred from these coastal towns to Taiwan, spurred by the severe hardships incurred from the Qing relocation policy.

Such restriction was relaxed following the 1760s and by 1811 there were more than two million Chinese immigrants on Taiwan. In 1875 [[Taipeh Prefecture]] was established, under the jurisdiction of Fujian Province. Also, there had been various conflicts between Chinese immigrants. Most conflicts were between Han from Fujian and Han from [[Guangdong]], between people from different areas of Fujian, between Han and [[Hakka people|Hakka]] settlers, or simply between people of different surnames engaged in clan feuds. Because of the strong provincial loyalties held by these immigrants, the Qing government felt Taiwan was somewhat difficult to govern.

The brig ''Ann'' also became shipwrecked in March 1842. Most of the crew were Indian [[lascar]]s. Survivors from both ships were transferred by authorities to the capital [[Tainan]]. The Taiwan Qing commanders, Ta-hung-ah and Yao Ying, filed a disingenuous report to the emperor, claiming to have defended against an attack from the Keelung fort. In October 1841, [[HMS Nimrod (1828)|HMS ''Nimrod'']] sailed to Keelung to search for the ''Nerbudda'' survivors, but after Captain Joseph Pearse found out that they were sent south for imprisonment, he ordered the bombardment of the harbour and destroyed 27 sets of cannon before returning to Hong Kong.

In 1867 the entire American crew of the ''Rover'' were massacred by aboriginals in the [[Rover incident|''Rover'' incident]]. When the Americans launched the punitive [[Formosa Expedition]] in retaliation, the aboriginals defeated the Americans and forced them to retreat, killing an American marine while suffering no casualties themselves.\n\nDuring the [[Sino-French War]], the French attempted an invasion of Taiwan during the [[Keelung Campaign]] in 1884. [[Liu Mingchuan]], who was leading the defense of Taiwan, recruited Aboriginals to serve alongside the Chinese soldiers in fighting against the French. The French were defeated at the [[Battle of Tamsui]] and the Qing forces pinned the French down at Keelung in an eight-month-long campaign before the French withdrew. Because of these incursions, the Qing government began constructing a series of coastal defenses and in 1885, work commenced to make Taiwan a province, with Liu Mingchuan serving as the first governor. He divided Taiwan into eleven counties and tried to improve relations with the aborigines. He also developed a railway from [[Taipei]] to [[Hsinchu]], established a mine in Keelung, and built an arsenal to improve Taiwan's defensive capability against foreigners.\n\nFollowing a shipwreck of a [[Ryukyu Kingdom|Ryukyuan]] vessel on the southeastern tip of Taiwan in winter of 1871, in which the heads of 54 crew members were taken by the aboriginal Taiwanese [[Paiwan people]] in the [[Mudan incident (1871)|Mudan incident]], the Japanese sought to use this incident as a pretext to have the Qing formally acknowledge Japanese sovereignty over the [[Ryukyu Islands]] as Japanese territory and to test reactions to potential expansion into Taiwan. According to records from Japanese documents, {{Interlanguage link multi|Mao Changxi|zh|3=\u6bdb\u6636\u7199}} and {{Interlanguage link multi|Dong Xun|zh|3=\u8463\u6042}}, the [[Qing]] ministers at [[Zongli Yamen]] who handled the complaints from Japanese envoy {{Interlanguage link multi|Yanagihara Sakimitsu|ja|3=\u67f3\u539f\u524d\u5149}}, replied first that they had heard only of a massacre of Ryukyuans, not of Japanese, and quickly noted that Ryukyu was under [[List of tributaries of Imperial China|Chinese suzerainty]], and therefore this issue was not Japan's business. In addition, the governor-general of the Qing province [[Fujian]] had rescued the survivors of the massacre and returned them safely to Ryukyu. The Qing authorities explained that there were two kinds of aborigines on Taiwan: those governed by the Qing, and those unnaturalized \"raw barbarians&nbsp;... beyond the reach of Qing government and customs.\" They indirectly hinted that foreigners traveling in those areas settled by indigenous people must exercise caution.\n\nAfter the Yanagihara-Yamen interview, the Japanese took their explanation to mean that the Qing government had not opposed Japan's claims to sovereignty over the Ryukyu Islands, disclaimed any jurisdiction over Aboriginal Taiwanese, and had indeed consented to Japan's expedition to Taiwan.{{sfnp|Leung|1983|p=270}} The Qing dynasty made it clear to the Japanese that Taiwan was definitely within Qing jurisdiction, even though part of that island's aboriginal population was not yet under the influence of Chinese culture. The Qing also pointed to similar cases all over the world where an aboriginal population within a national boundary was not completely [[Subjugated mentality|subjugated]] by the [[dominant culture]] of that country.\n\nThe Japanese nevertheless launched [[Taiwan Expedition of 1874|an expedition]] to Mutan village with a force of 3600 soldiers in 1874. The number of killed [[Paiwan people|Paiwan]] was about thirty, and that for the Japanese was six. Eventually, the Japanese withdrew after being paid a massive [[indemnity]] by the Qing. This incident caused the Qing to re-think the importance of Taiwan in their maritime defense strategy and greater importance was placed on gaining control over the wilderness regions.\n\nOn the eve of the [[First Sino-Japanese War]], about 45 percent of the island was administered under direct Qing administration while the remaining was lightly populated by [[Taiwanese aborigines|Aborigines]].{{sfnp|Morris|2002|pp=5\u20136}} In a population of around 2.5 million, about 2.3 million were [[Han Chinese]] and the remaining two hundred thousand were classified as members of various indigenous tribes.\n\n===End of Qing Rule===\n[[Image:1896 map of Taiwan.png|thumb|250px|1896 map of Formosa, revised by Rev.

Some were goaded by [[Chinese nationalism]], while others contained nascent Taiwanese self-determination.{{sfnp|Zhang|1998|p=514}} Rebellions were often caused by a combination of the effects of unequal colonial policies on local elites and extant [[Millenarianism|millenarian]] beliefs of the local Taiwanese and plains Aborigines. Aboriginal resistance to the heavy-handed Japanese policies of acculturation and pacification lasted up until the early 1930s.{{sfnp|Katz|2005}} The last major Aboriginal rebellion, the [[Musha incident|Musha (Wushe) Uprising]] in late 1930 by the [[Atayal people]] angry over their treatment while laboring in the burdensome job of [[camphor]] extraction, launched the last headhunting party in which over 150 Japanese officials were killed and beheaded during the opening ceremonies of a school.

Some felt that the safety of personal life and property was of utmost importance and went along with the Japanese colonial authorities. The second group of Taiwanese were eager to become imperial subjects, believing that such action would lead to equal status with Japanese nationals. The third group was influenced by [[Taiwan independence]] and tried to get rid of the Japanese colonials to establish a native Taiwanese rule. The fourth group on the other hand were influenced by [[Chinese nationalism]] and fought for the return of Taiwan to Chinese rule. From 1897 onwards, this last group staged many rebellions, the most famous one being led by {{Interlanguage link multi|Luo Fuxing|zh|3=\u7f85\u798f\u661f}}, who was arrested and executed along with two hundred of his comrades in 1913.

The [[Bank of Taiwan]] was established in 1899 to encourage Japanese [[private sector]]s, including [[Mitsubishi]] and the [[Mitsui|Mitsui Group]], to invest in Taiwan. In 1900, the third [[Governor-General of Taiwan]] passed a budget which initiated the building of [[Rail transport in Taiwan|Taiwan's railroad system]] from Kirun ([[Keelung]]) to Takao ([[Kaohsiung]]). By 1905 the island had electric power supplied by water power in [[Sun-Moon Lake]], and in subsequent years Taiwan was considered the second-most developed region of East Asia (after Japan). By 1905, Taiwan was financially self-sufficient and had been weaned off of subsidies from Japan's central government.\n\nUnder the governor [[Shimpei Goto]]'s rule, many major public works projects were completed. The [[Rail transport in Taiwan|Taiwan rail system]] connecting the south and the north and the modernizations of Kirun ([[Keelung]]) and Takao ([[Kaohsiung]]) ports were completed to facilitate transport and shipping of raw material and agricultural products.{{sfnp|Takekoshi|1907}} Exports increased by fourfold. 55% of agricultural land was covered by dam-supported [[irrigation]] systems. Food production had increased fourfold and [[Sugarcane|sugar cane]] production had increased 15-fold between 1895 and 1925 and Taiwan became a major foodbasket serving Japan's industrial economy. A health care system was widely established and [[infectious diseases]] were almost completely eradicated. The average lifespan for a Taiwanese resident would become 60 years by 1945.{{sfnp|Kerr|1966}}\n\n[[File:Chiayi City Historical Relic Museum 20060121.jpg|thumb|right|[[Kagi Shrine]], one of many Shinto shrines built in Taiwan.]]\nIn October 1935, the Governor-General of Taiwan held an \"[[The Taiwan Exposition: In Commemoration of the First Forty Years of Colonial Rule|Exposition to Commemorate the 40th Anniversary of the Beginning of Administration in Taiwan]]\", which served as a showcase for the achievements of Taiwan's modernization process under Japanese rule. This attracted worldwide attention, including the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]]'s [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) regime which sent the Japanese-educated [[Chen Yi (Kuomintang)|Chen Yi]] to attend the affair. He expressed his admiration about the efficiency of Japanese government in developing Taiwan, and commented on how lucky the Taiwanese were to live under such effective administration. Somewhat ironically, Chen Yi would later become the ROC's first Chief Executive of Taiwan, who would be infamous for the corruption that occurred under his watch.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nThe later period of Japanese rule saw a local elite educated and organized. During the 1930s several home rule groups were created at a time when others around the world sought to end colonialism. In 1935, the Taiwanese elected their first group of local legislators. By March 1945, the Japanese legislative branch hastily modified election laws to allow Taiwanese representation in the [[Japanese Diet]].{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n===World War II===\n[[File:Takasago Volunteer Corps.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Takasago Volunteers]] were a unit of the Japanese Army recruited from Taiwanese aboriginal tribes.]]\nAs Japan embarked on [[Japanese invasion of China|full-scale war in China]] in 1937, it expanded Taiwan's industrial capacity to manufacture war material. By 1939, industrial production had exceeded agricultural production in Taiwan. At the same time, the \"[[K\u014dminka movement (Taiwan)|''k\u014dminka'']]\" imperialization project was put under way to instill the \"Japanese Spirit\" in Taiwanese residents, and ensure the Taiwanese would remain loyal subjects of the Japanese Emperor ready to make sacrifices during wartime. Measures including Japanese-language education, the option of adopting Japanese names, and the worship of Japanese religion were instituted. In 1943, 94% of the children received 6-year compulsory education. From 1937 to 1945, 126,750 Taiwanese joined and served in the [[Imperial Japanese Army|military of the Japanese Empire]], while a further 80,433 were conscripted between 1942 and 1945. Of the sum total, 30,304, or 15%, died in [[Japan in World War II|Japan's war in Asia]].\n\nThe [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] operated heavily out of Taiwan. The \"[[The Japanese Navy Taiwan and South Pacific Mandate political project|South Strike Group]]\" was based out of the [[Taihoku Imperial University]] (now National Taiwan University) in Taiwan. Many of the Japanese forces participating in the [[Aerial Battle of Taiwan-Okinawa]] were based in Taiwan. Important Japanese military bases and industrial centers throughout Taiwan, like [[Takao, Taiwan|Takao]] (now Kaohsiung), were targets of heavy American bombing.\n\nIn 1942, after the United States entered the war against Japan and on the side of China, the Chinese government under the [[KMT]] renounced all treaties signed with Japan before that date and made Taiwan's return to China (as with [[Manchuria]], ruled as the Japanese [[Puppet States of WWII|wartime puppet state]] of \"[[Manchukuo]]\") one of the wartime objectives. In the [[1943 Cairo Declaration|Cairo Declaration]] of 1943, the [[Allies of World War II|Allied Powers]] declared the return of [[Taiwan (island)|Taiwan]] (including the [[Pescadores]]) to the Republic of China as one of several Allied demands. In 1945, Japan unconditionally surrendered with signing of the [[Japanese Instrument of Surrender|instrument of surrender]] and ended its rule in Taiwan as the territory was put under the administrative control of the Republic of China government in 1945 by the [[United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration]].<ref name=\"unhcr.org\">{{cite web |url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country,,,,TWN,,4954ce6323,0.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728144641/http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country,,,,TWN,,4954ce6323,0.html |archivedate=2011-07-28 }} UNHCR</ref><ref>{{cite news\n|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2013/06/09/2003564336\n|title=CIA report shows Taiwan concerns\n|work=Taipei Times |date=9 Jun 2013 |page=1 |last=Lowther |first=William\n|quote=[Quoting from a declassified CIA report on Taiwan written in March 1949] From the legal standpoint, Taiwan is not part of the Republic of China.

Together with businessmen who fled from mainland China, they once again revived Taiwan's prosperity previously ceased along with Japanese withdrawal and managed Taiwan's transition from an agricultural to a commercial, industrial economy.\n\nFrom 1950 to 1965, Taiwan received a total of $1.5 billion in economic aid and $2.4 billion in military aid from the United States. In 1965 all American aid ceased when Taiwan had established a solid financial base.{{sfnp|Chan|1997}} Having accomplished that, [[President of the Republic of China|ROC president]] [[Chiang Ching-kuo]]<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://taiwanpedia.culture.tw/en/content?ID=3933 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-07-19 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130419042325/http://taiwanpedia.culture.tw/en/content?ID=3933 |archive-date=2013-04-19 |url-status=dead }}</ref> (the son of [[Chiang Kai-shek]]) started state projects such as the [[Ten Major Construction Projects]] that provided the infrastructure for building a strong export-driven economy. Taiwan has developed steadily into a major international trading power with more than $218 billion in two-way trade and one of the highest [[foreign exchange reserves]] in the world. Tremendous prosperity on the island was accompanied by economic and social stability. Taiwan's phenomenal economic development earned it a spot as one of the [[Four Asian Tigers]].\n\n=== Democratic reforms ===\nUntil the early 1970s, the Republic of China was recognized as the sole legitimate government of China by the United Nations and most Western nations; who refused to recognize the [[People's Republic of China]] on account of the [[Cold War]]. The KMT ruled Taiwan under [[martial law]] until the late 1980s, with the stated goal of being vigilant against Communist infiltration and preparing to retake mainland China. Therefore, political dissent was not tolerated.\n\nThe late 1970s and early 1980s were a turbulent time for Chinese people born in Taiwan, as many of the people who had originally been oppressed and left behind by economic changes became members of the Taiwan's new middle class. Free enterprise had allowed native Taiwanese to gain a powerful bargaining chip in their demands for respect for their basic human rights. The [[Kaohsiung Incident]] would be a major turning point for democracy in Taiwan.\n\nTaiwan also faced setbacks in the international sphere. In 1971, the ROC government walked out of the United Nations shortly before it recognized the PRC government in Beijing as the legitimate holder of China's seat in the United Nations. The ROC had been offered dual representation,{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} but Chiang Kai-shek demanded to retain a seat on the [[United Nations Security Council|UN Security Council]], which was not acceptable to the PRC.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} Chiang expressed his decision in his famous \"[[the sky is not big enough for two suns]]\" speech.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018|reason=Text of this speech should be linked}} In October 1971, [[China and the United Nations|Resolution 2758]] was passed by the UN General Assembly and \"the representatives of Chiang Kai-shek\" (and thus the ROC) were expelled from the UN and replaced as \"China\" by the PRC. In 1979, the United States switched recognition from Taipei to Beijing.\n\nChiang Kai-shek died in April 1975, and was succeeded to the presidency by [[Yen Chia-kan]] while his son [[Chiang Ching-kuo]] succeeded to the leadership of the Kuomintang (opting to take the title \"Chairman\" rather than the elder Chiang's title of \"Director-General\"). Formerly the head of the feared [[secret police]], Chiang Ching-kuo recognized gaining foreign support to securing the ROC's future security required reform. His administration saw a gradual loosening of political controls, a transition towards democracy, and moves toward [[Taiwanization]] of the regime.{{sfnp|Hu|2005|pp=26\u201327}} Opponents of the Nationalists were no longer forbidden to hold meetings or publish papers. Though opposition political parties were still illegal, when the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] was established as the first opposition party in 1986, President Chiang decided against dissolving the group or persecuting its leaders. Its candidates officially ran in elections as independents in the [[Tangwai movement]]. In the following year, Chiang ended martial law and allowed family visits to [[mainland China]].{{sfnp|Hu|2005|pp=32\u201343}} Chiang selected [[Lee Teng-hui]], a Taiwan born technocrat to be his vice president; the first in the line of succession to the presidency. The move followed other reforms giving more power to native born citizens and calmed anti-KMT sentiments.{{sfnp|Hu|2005|pp=33\u201334}}\n\nAfter Chiang Ching-kuo died in 1988, his successor, President [[Lee Teng-hui]], continued to democratize the government. Lee transferred more government authority to Taiwanese born citizens, and Taiwan underwent a process of [[Taiwanization]]. In this localization process, local culture and history was promoted over a pan-China viewpoint. Lee's reforms included printing banknotes from the Central Bank instead of the usual Provincial Bank of Taiwan. He also largely suspended the operation of the [[Taiwan Provincial Government]]. In 1991 the [[Legislative Yuan]] and [[National Assembly (Republic of China)|National Assembly]] elected in 1947 were forced to resign. These groups were originally created to represent mainland China constituencies. The restrictions on the use of [[Languages of Taiwan|Taiwanese languages]] in the broadcast media and in schools were also lifted.\n\nHowever, Lee failed to crack down on the massive corruption that pervaded the government and many KMT loyalists felt that Lee betrayed the ROC by taking reforms too far, while those in the opposition felt he did not take reforms far enough.\n\n===Democratic period===\nLee ran as the incumbent in Taiwan's first direct [[1996 Republic of China presidential election|presidential election in 1996]] against DPP candidate and former dissident, Peng Min-ming. This election prompted the PRC to conduct a series of missile tests in the [[Taiwan Strait]] to intimidate the Taiwanese electorate so that electorates would vote for other pro-unification candidates, [[Chen Li-an]] and [[Lin Yang-kang]]. The aggressive tactic prompted U.S. President [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]] to invoke the [[Taiwan Relations Act]] and dispatch two aircraft carrier battle groups into the region off Taiwan's southern coast to monitor the situation, and PRC's missile tests were forced to end earlier than planned. This incident is known as the [[Third Taiwan Strait Crisis|1996 Taiwan Straits Crisis]].{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nOne of Lee's final acts as president was to declare on German radio that the ROC and the PRC have a [[Special state-to-state relations|special state to state relationship]]. Lee's statement was met with the PRC's People's Army conducting military drills in Fujian and a frightening island-wide [[Power outage|blackout]] in Taiwan, causing many to fear an attack or cyberattack.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nThe [[2000 ROC presidential election|2000 presidential election]] marked the end of the Kuomintang (KMT) rule. DPP candidate [[Chen Shui-bian]] won a three-way race that saw the [[Pan-Blue]] vote split by independent [[James Soong]] (formerly of the Kuomintang) and Kuomintang candidate [[Lien Chan]]. Chen garnered 39% of the vote.<ref>Asia Society, \"Opposition Wins Taiwan Election,\" (2000)</ref> After the election, Soong formed the [[People First Party (Republic of China)|People First Party]] (PFP).{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\n[[2004 Taiwan presidential election|In 2004]], President Chen was re-elected to a second four-year term after an assassination attempt which occurred the day before the election. Two shots were fired, with one bullet grazing the President's belly after penetrating the windshield of a jeep and several layers of clothing and the other bullet penetrated the windshield and hitting the vice president's knee cast. (She was wearing a knee cast due to an earlier injury.) Police investigators have said that the most likely suspect is believed to have been [[Chen Yi-hsiung]], who was later found dead.<ref>Reuters, \"Taiwan election shooting suspect dead,\" (2005)</ref> Their injuries were not life-threatening, but the incident is believed by Pan-Blue to have gained them enough sympathy to influence the result.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nThat incident might also have given president Chen the ability to declare a state of emergency and martial law, which allegedly prevented the police and military, which were strongly Pan-Blue,{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} from voting. Lien refused to concede, alleging voting irregularities. Kuomintang and PFP supporters held mass protests throughout the following weeks. Subsequently, Kuomintang and PFP took the case to the court. The [[High Court of Taiwan|High Court]] ordered a recount and found no evidence to support the accusation made by Kuomintang and PFP. The Court decided that the election result was legitimate and valid.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nDuring the [[2004 Taiwan legislative election|legislative elections]] held on December 8, 2004, the Kuomintang-PFP dominated Pan-Blue alliance gained a slim majority in the elections which resulted in President Chen resigning as DPP chairman. The cabinet of Premier [[Yu Shyi-kun]] resigned, and [[Frank Hsieh]] assumed premiership on January 25, 2005.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nIn a move that some{{Who|date=December 2018}} saw as a reaction to Chen's re-election, the People's Republic of China enacted a proposed [[National Unification Promotion Law of the People's Republic of China (proposed)|anti-secession law]] that allows the [[use of force]] on Taiwan and the Republic of China government if it formally declares independence. However, this law was met with overwhelming protest from nearly all political parties and public figures of the Republic of China and disapproval from the western countries. Negotiations in January in [[Macau]] between the aviation authorities from both the Republic of China and People's Republic of China resulted in direct [[Cross-Strait charter|cross-strait charter flights]] between mainland China and Taiwan during the [[Chinese New Year|Chinese Lunar New Year]] Period.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nIn a twist of events, President Chen and PFP Chairman Soong held a summit and the independence-leaning president indicated that eventual [[Chinese unification|reunification with mainland China]] would be an option. Against the anti-secession law proposed by the People's Republic of China, President Chen held a video conference with the [[European Parliament]] in [[Brussels]] urging the [[European Union]] not to lift the arms embargo on the People's Republic of China.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nDomestic politics during the Chen administration were largely a political stalemate as the Kuomintang and PFP together held a pan-Blue majority in the legislature. Among the many items that made little progress due to the political stalemate were a stalled arms procurement bill, which would have advanced defense capabilities of the Republic of China through the purchase of weaponry, such as sub-hunting [[P-3 Orion]]s, from the US government, and banking reform legislation, which would have helped in the consolidation of the many banks in the Republic of China, none of which hold even 10% shares of the local market. The [[president of the Republic of China]], unlike the president of the United States, does not wield [[veto power]], providing him with little to no leverage in negotiating with an opposition legislature, regardless of how slim the majority.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nThe constitution was [[Additional Articles of the Constitution of the Republic of China|further amended]] in 2005, creating a two-vote electoral system, with [[single member plurality]] seats and [[proportional representation|proportional representative]] seats, and abolishing the National Assembly, transferring most of its former powers to the [[Legislative Yuan]], and leaving further amendment voting to public referendums. The issue of formally declaring the [[Taiwan independence|independence of Taiwan]] is also a constant constitutional question. Arms purchases from the United States are still a controversial political question, with the [[Pan-Green Coalition]] camp favoring the purchase, and the [[Pan-Blue Coalition]] opposing it.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n\nRecent allegations about [[political corruption|corruption]] inside the [[First Family]] had led to three [[Recall election|recall motions]] votes in the [[Legislative Yuan]] aimed at ousting President [[Chen Shui-bian]]. All of them had failed since the Pan-Blue Coalition lacked the [[two-thirds majority]] required to complete the process and the [[political parties]] voted according to political lines. The [[First Lady]], [[Wu Shu-chen]] was prosecuted for corruption, namely illegally using state funds for personal reasons.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nThe president faced similar accusations as his wife, but was protected from prosecution by presidential [[Legal immunity|immunity]]. He had promised to resign if his wife was found guilty. However, after his wife fainted in the preparation hearing, she had sought and obtained absence of leave from the Court 16 times citing health concerns before President Chen Shui-bian's term was complete.<ref>[http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/national/national%20news/2008/09/18/175153/Former-first.htm Former first lady Wu to appear in court], ''China Post''</ref>\n\nIn December 2006, municipal and mayoral elections were held in [[Taipei]] and [[Kaohsiung]]. The [[KMT]] retained a clear majority in the capital, while the [[Democratic Progressive Party|DPP]] and the KMT obtained very close results in the southern city of [[Kaohsiung]]. [[Huang Chun-ying]] lost to [[Chen Chu]] by a margin of 0.14 percent; 378,303 votes to 379,417 votes, making [[Chen Chu]] the first female mayor of a [[Special municipality (Taiwan)|special municipality]] in the Republic of China. In 2007, the ROC applied for membership in the United Nations under the name \"Taiwan\", and was rejected by the General Assembly.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nIn 2007, President Chen proposed a policy of [[Four Wants and One Without]], which in substance states that Taiwan wants independence; Taiwan wants the rectification of its name; Taiwan wants a new constitution; Taiwan wants development; and Taiwanese politics is without [[Left\u2013right political spectrum|the question of left or right]], but only the question of [[Chinese unification|unification]] or [[Taiwan independence movement|independence]]. The reception of this proposed policy in Taiwanese general public was unclear. It, however, was met with a cold reception by both the PRC and the United States. The PRC Foreign Minister emphasised that the [[Anti-Secession Law]] was not a piece of [[Unenforceable|unenforceable legislation]], while the US Department of State spokesman Sean McCormack described Chen's policy as \"unhelpful\".<ref>{{cite web | title=US Says Taiwanese President's Independence Remarks 'Unhelpful'|date=2007-03-05 | publisher=Voice of America | url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/taiwan/2007/taiwan-070305-voa02.htm}}</ref>\n\nThe KMT also retained control of the legislature in the [[2008 Republic of China legislative election|Legislative Yuan elections in January 2008]]. In the [[2008 Republic of China presidential election|presidential election in May 2008]], KMT candidate [[Ma Ying-jeou]] ran on a platform supporting friendlier relations with mainland China and economic reforms, and defeated DPP candidate [[Frank Hsieh]] with 58.48% of the vote.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nOn the same day President Chen left office, losing presidential immunity, the Supreme Prosecutor's Office announced that they were launching an inquiry into corruption charges regarding Chen.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7409956.stm Taiwan ex-leader faces graft case]</ref> Later in 2008, members of his administration, including [[Chiou I-jen]], a former National Security Council secretary-general, and Yeh Sheng-mao, former director-general of the Ministry of Justice's Investigation Bureau, were arrested on [[Chen Shui-bian corruption charges|corruption charges]].

In the end, the government agreed to put on hold the ratification of an agreement with China which they had pushed through without proper debate. This event had far reaching consequences, and changed the mood of the electorate. In the [[2016 Republic of China general election|combined elections in January 2016]] the opposition candidate for President, [[Tsai Ing-wen]], of the DPP won with 56% of the vote, and the opposition DPP was catapulted into an outright majority in the parliament.

He died at the age of 19, fatally shot in a duel with [[George Eacker]] at [[Weehawken, New Jersey|Weehawken]], [[New Jersey]].\n\n==Birth and early childhood==\nPhilip Hamilton was born in Albany, New York, on January 22, 1782. His father, Alexander Hamilton, was the first U.S. Secretary of the Treasury and one of the [[Founding Fathers of the United States]]. His mother, Elizabeth Schuyler Hamilton, was the daughter of [[Philip Schuyler]], for whom he was named.\n\nAlexander Hamilton wrote that Philip's birth was \"attended with all the [[omen]]s of future greatness,\"<ref name=pbs/> and continued to express high expectations and hopes for the future of his firstborn:\n{{Cquote \n|text=You reproach me with not having said enough about our little stranger. When I wrote last I was not sufficiently acquainted with him to give you his character. I may now assure you... [h]e is truly a very fine young gentleman, the most agreeable in his conversation and manners of any I ever knew\u2014nor less remarkable for his intelligence and sweetness of temper. You are not to imagine by my beginning with his mental qualifications that he is defective in personal. It is agreed on all hands, that he is handsome, his features are good, his eye is not only sprightly and expressive but it is full of benignity. His attitude in sitting is by connoisseurs esteemed graceful and he has a method of waving his hand that announces the future orator. He stands however rather awkwardly and his legs have not all the delicate slimness of his fathers. It is feared He may never excel as much in dancing which is probably the only accomplishment in which he will not be a model. If he has any fault in manners, he laughs too much. He has now passed his Seventh Month.<ref name=meade/>\n|author=[[Alexander Hamilton]]\n|source=Letter to [[Richard Kidder Meade (colonel)|Richard Kidder Meade]], August 27, 1782, describing a 7-month old Philip Hamilton\n}}\n\n==Education==\nLate in 1791, at the age of nine, Philip was sent to attend a [[boarding school]] in [[Trenton, New Jersey]], studying with William Frazer, an [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]] clergyman and rector of [[St. Michael's Church, Trenton, New Jersey|St. Michael's Church]].<ref name=papers-v17/><ref name=papers-v18/> In early December that year, his father wrote encouragingly from Philadelphia: {{blockquote |quote=Your Master also informs me that you recited a lesson the first day you began, very much to his satisfaction. I expect every letter from him will give me a fresh proof of your progress. For I know that you can do a great deal, if you please, and I am sure you have too much spirit not to exert yourself, that you may make us every day more and more proud of you.<ref name=pbs/><ref name=Ham1791/> }} By 1794, his younger brother [[Alexander Hamilton Jr.|Alexander Jr.]], then eight years old, joined him at the boarding school.<ref name=papers-v17/><ref name=papers-v18/>\n\nPhilip enrolled in [[Columbia College (New York)|Columbia College]], where his knowledge and enthusiasm were compared to that of his father, already a renowned alumnus. [[Robert Troup]], a family friend who had been Alexander Hamilton's college roommate, wrote that Philip \"was very promising in genius and acquirements, and Hamilton formed high expectations of his future greatness!\"<ref name=founders-king/> Troup wrote privately, however, that despite Hamilton's certainty that Philip was destined for greatness, \"alas Philip is a sad [[Rake (character)|rake]] and I have serious doubts whether he would ever be an honour to his family or his country.\"<ref name=Locke1971/><ref name=Fleming1999/>\n\nPhilip graduated with honors from Columbia College in 1800,<ref name=\"appleton\" /> and went on to study law. His father prescribed rigorous study routines, including waking for study at 6 o'clock every day from April through September, and not later than 7 o'clock for the rest of the year, after which, \"From the time he is dressed in the morning til nine o'clock (the time for breakfast excluded) he is to read law.\"<ref name=pbs/>\n\n== Duel and death ==\nOn July 4, 1801, a New York lawyer named [[George Eacker]] gave an [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] speech hosted by a New York State Militia brigade and by the [[Tammany Society]].<ref name=Eacker1801/> The Tammany Society, better known as [[Tammany Hall]], was a [[Democratic-Republican party]] political organization that [[Aaron Burr]] had built into a [[political machine]].<ref name=Golway2014/> In the speech, Eacker reportedly said that Alexander Hamilton would not be opposed to overthrowing [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s presidency by force.<ref name=pbs2/>\n\nFour months later, on November 20, 1801, Philip and a friend named [[Stephen Price (theatre manager)|Stephen Price]] encountered Eacker while attending a play at the [[Park Theatre (Manhattan)|Park Theatre]].<ref name=Rush1801/><ref name=Donohue/><ref name=Todd1897/> Philip confronted Eacker about the speech, and in the ensuing disturbance, Eacker was heard to call Philip and Price \"damned rascals\".<ref name=pbs2/> In response to the verbal hostilities and Eacker's insult, the two formally challenged Eacker to a [[duel]]. Acquaintances wrote that Alexander Hamilton counseled his son, telling him to engage in a [[Deloping|delope]], throwing away his first shot.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\n[[File:Weehawken dueling grounds sign IMG 6353.JPG|thumb|This plaque marks the location in Weehawken, New Jersey, where Philip Hamilton and his father Alexander engaged in their respective duels.]]\nThe duel took place in Weehawken, New Jersey, the same place where the elder Hamilton would later be mortally wounded in a [[Hamilton-Burr duel|duel with Burr]]. Eacker faced Philip and Price separately, dueling Price the day after the challenge, and Philip the following day. In Eacker's duel with Price, neither party was injured, but four shots were fired.<ref name=Winfield205/> The next day, November 23, 1801, Philip took his father's advice, and refused to raise his pistol to fire after he and Eacker had counted ten paces and faced each other. Eacker, following suit, did not shoot either. For the first minute, both men stood, doing nothing, both refusing to shoot. After a minute, Eacker finally raised his pistol, and Philip did the same. Eacker shot and struck Philip above his right hip. The bullet went through his body and lodged in his left arm. In what may have been an involuntary [[spasm]], Philip also fired his pistol before he hit the ground, but this bullet did nothing.\n\nAs Philip fell on the ground bleeding, he displayed, as described by both sides, exemplary poise and dignity. \"His manner on the ground was calm and composed beyond expression,\" the ''[[New York Post]]'' reported. \"The idea of his own danger seemed to be lost in anticipation of the satisfaction which he might receive from the final triumph of his generous moderation.\"<ref name=Chernow/> Philip was then rushed across the river to the home of his aunt, [[Angelica Schuyler Church]], in [[Manhattan]]. She wrote, \"His conduct was extraordinary during this trial.\"<ref name=achurch-letter/>\n\nUpon hearing of the events, Alexander Hamilton rushed to the home of Dr. [[David Hosack]], the same physician who would later attend him after his own fatal duel in 1804. Hamilton wished to inform Hosack of the possible need for his medical services. Hosack's family told Hamilton that he, having already heard about the duel, had already left for the home of John and Angelica Church, Philip's aunt and uncle, where Philip had been taken. Hosack wrote that when Alexander had arrived at the Hosacks' home, he \"was so much overcome by his anxiety that he fainted and remained some time in my family before he was sufficiently recovered to proceed\" to the Church home to see his son. When Hamilton arrived, he observed the pale and ashen appearance of Philip's face and tested his pulse. According to Hosack, \"he instantly turned from the bed and, taking me by the hand, which he grasped with all the agony of grief, he exclaimed in a tone and manner that can never be effaced from my memory, 'Doctor, I despair.'\"<ref name=\"Chernow\" /> Philip's mother was three months pregnant at this time, and upon her arrival, she and Hamilton stayed beside Philip through the night. After making a profession of faith, Philip died at 5:00{{nbsp}}am, fourteen hours after the initial wound.\n\nPhilip was buried on a stormy day, with many mourners in attendance. It was reported that as Hamilton approached his son's grave, he had to be held up by friends and family, due to grief.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} Philip's unmarked grave is near the graves of his parents, in the churchyard of [[Trinity Church (Manhattan)|Trinity Church]] in [[New York City]].<ref name=Sullivan2016/>\n\n== Aftermath ==\nFollowing Philip's death, his family fell into disarray. His 17-year-old sister, [[Angelica Hamilton]], suffered a [[mental breakdown]] from which she never recovered; her mental state deteriorated until she became only intermittently lucid, and she sometimes could not even recognize family members. She spent the rest of her life in a state described as \"eternal childhood,\" often talking to her brother as if he were still alive.<ref name=Chernow/>\n\nFriends of the family wrote that Philip's parents never went back to their old selves after the death of their son {{fact|date=April 2020}}. On June 2, 1802, Elizabeth gave birth to their youngest child, with whom she was pregnant at the time of Philip's death.

He died at the age of 19, fatally shot in a duel with [[George Eacker]] at [[Weehawken, New Jersey|Weehawken]], [[New Jersey]].\n\n==Birth and early childhood==\nPhilip Hamilton was born in Albany, New York, on January 22, 1782. His father, Alexander Hamilton, was the first U.S. Secretary of the Treasury and one of the [[Founding Fathers of the United States]]. His mother, Elizabeth Schuyler Hamilton, was the daughter of [[Philip Schuyler]], for whom he was named.\n\nAlexander Hamilton wrote that Philip's birth was \"attended with all the [[omen]]s of future greatness,\"<ref name=pbs/> and continued to express high expectations and hopes for the future of his firstborn:\n{{Cquote \n|text=You reproach me with not having said enough about our little stranger. When I wrote last I was not sufficiently acquainted with him to give you his character. I may now assure you... [h]e is truly a very fine young gentleman, the most agreeable in his conversation and manners of any I ever knew\u2014nor less remarkable for his intelligence and sweetness of temper. You are not to imagine by my beginning with his mental qualifications that he is defective in personal. It is agreed on all hands, that he is handsome, his features are good, his eye is not only sprightly and expressive but it is full of benignity. His attitude in sitting is by connoisseurs esteemed graceful and he has a method of waving his hand that announces the future orator. He stands however rather awkwardly and his legs have not all the delicate slimness of his fathers. It is feared He may never excel as much in dancing which is probably the only accomplishment in which he will not be a model. If he has any fault in manners, he laughs too much. He has now passed his Seventh Month.<ref name=meade/>\n|author=[[Alexander Hamilton]]\n|source=Letter to [[Richard Kidder Meade (colonel)|Richard Kidder Meade]], August 27, 1782, describing a 7-month old Philip Hamilton\n}}\n\n==Education==\nLate in 1791, at the age of nine, Philip was sent to attend a [[boarding school]] in [[Trenton, New Jersey]], studying with William Frazer, an [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]] clergyman and rector of [[St. Michael's Church, Trenton, New Jersey|St. Michael's Church]].<ref name=papers-v17/><ref name=papers-v18/> In early December that year, his father wrote encouragingly from Philadelphia: {{blockquote |quote=Your Master also informs me that you recited a lesson the first day you began, very much to his satisfaction. I expect every letter from him will give me a fresh proof of your progress. For I know that you can do a great deal, if you please, and I am sure you have too much spirit not to exert yourself, that you may make us every day more and more proud of you.<ref name=pbs/><ref name=Ham1791/> }} By 1794, his younger brother [[Alexander Hamilton Jr.|Alexander Jr.]], then eight years old, joined him at the boarding school.<ref name=papers-v17/><ref name=papers-v18/>\n\nPhilip enrolled in [[Columbia College (New York)|Columbia College]], where his knowledge and enthusiasm were compared to that of his father, already a renowned alumnus. [[Robert Troup]], a family friend who had been Alexander Hamilton's college roommate, wrote that Philip \"was very promising in genius and acquirements, and Hamilton formed high expectations of his future greatness!\"<ref name=founders-king/> Troup wrote privately, however, that despite Hamilton's certainty that Philip was destined for greatness, \"alas Philip is a sad [[Rake (character)|rake]] and I have serious doubts whether he would ever be an honour to his family or his country.\"<ref name=Locke1971/><ref name=Fleming1999/>\n\nPhilip graduated with honors from Columbia College in 1800,<ref name=\"appleton\" /> and went on to study law. His father prescribed rigorous study routines, including waking for study at 6 o'clock every day from April through September, and not later than 7 o'clock for the rest of the year, after which, \"From the time he is dressed in the morning til nine o'clock (the time for breakfast excluded) he is to read law.\"<ref name=pbs/>\n\n== Duel and death ==\nOn July 4, 1801, a New York lawyer named [[George Eacker]] gave an [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] speech hosted by a New York State Militia brigade and by the [[Tammany Society]].<ref name=Eacker1801/> The Tammany Society, better known as [[Tammany Hall]], was a [[Democratic-Republican party]] political organization that [[Aaron Burr]] had built into a [[political machine]].<ref name=Golway2014/> In the speech, Eacker reportedly said that Alexander Hamilton would not be opposed to overthrowing [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s presidency by force.<ref name=pbs2/>\n\nFour months later, on November 20, 1801, Philip and a friend named [[Stephen Price (theatre manager)|Stephen Price]] encountered Eacker while attending a play at the [[Park Theatre (Manhattan)|Park Theatre]].<ref name=Rush1801/><ref name=Donohue/><ref name=Todd1897/> Philip confronted Eacker about the speech, and in the ensuing disturbance, Eacker was heard to call Philip and Price \"damned rascals\".<ref name=pbs2/> In response to the verbal hostilities and Eacker's insult, the two formally challenged Eacker to a [[duel]]. Acquaintances wrote that Alexander Hamilton counseled his son, telling him to engage in a [[Deloping|delope]], throwing away his first shot.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\n[[File:Weehawken dueling grounds sign IMG 6353.JPG|thumb|This plaque marks the location in Weehawken, New Jersey, where Philip Hamilton and his father Alexander engaged in their respective duels.]]\nThe duel took place in Weehawken, New Jersey, the same place where the elder Hamilton would later be mortally wounded in a [[Hamilton-Burr duel|duel with Burr]]. Eacker faced Philip and Price separately, dueling Price the day after the challenge, and Philip the following day. In Eacker's duel with Price, neither party was injured, but four shots were fired.<ref name=Winfield205/> The next day, November 23, 1801, Philip took his father's advice, and refused to raise his pistol to fire after he and Eacker had counted ten paces and faced each other. Eacker, following suit, did not shoot either. For the first minute, both men stood, doing nothing, both refusing to shoot. After a minute, Eacker finally raised his pistol, and Philip did the same. Eacker shot and struck Philip above his right hip. The bullet went through his body and lodged in his left arm. In what may have been an involuntary [[spasm]], Philip also fired his pistol before he hit the ground, but this bullet did nothing.\n\nAs Philip fell on the ground bleeding, he displayed, as described by both sides, exemplary poise and dignity. \"His manner on the ground was calm and composed beyond expression,\" the ''[[New York Post]]'' reported. \"The idea of his own danger seemed to be lost in anticipation of the satisfaction which he might receive from the final triumph of his generous moderation.\"<ref name=Chernow/> Philip was then rushed across the river to the home of his aunt, [[Angelica Schuyler Church]], in [[Manhattan]]. She wrote, \"His conduct was extraordinary during this trial.\"<ref name=achurch-letter/>\n\nUpon hearing of the events, Alexander Hamilton rushed to the home of Dr. [[David Hosack]], the same physician who would later attend him after his own fatal duel in 1804. Hamilton wished to inform Hosack of the possible need for his medical services. Hosack's family told Hamilton that he, having already heard about the duel, had already left for the home of John and Angelica Church, Philip's aunt and uncle, where Philip had been taken. Hosack wrote that when Alexander had arrived at the Hosacks' home, he \"was so much overcome by his anxiety that he fainted and remained some time in my family before he was sufficiently recovered to proceed\" to the Church home to see his son. When Hamilton arrived, he observed the pale and ashen appearance of Philip's face and tested his pulse. According to Hosack, \"he instantly turned from the bed and, taking me by the hand, which he grasped with all the agony of grief, he exclaimed in a tone and manner that can never be effaced from my memory, 'Doctor, I despair.'\"<ref name=\"Chernow\" /> Philip's mother was three months pregnant at this time, and upon her arrival, she and Hamilton stayed beside Philip through the night. After making a profession of faith, Philip died at 5:00{{nbsp}}am, fourteen hours after the initial wound.\n\nPhilip was buried on a stormy day, with many mourners in attendance. It was reported that as Hamilton approached his son's grave, he had to be held up by friends and family, due to grief.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} Philip's unmarked grave is near the graves of his parents, in the churchyard of [[Trinity Church (Manhattan)|Trinity Church]] in [[New York City]].<ref name=Sullivan2016/>\n\n== Aftermath ==\nFollowing Philip's death, his family fell into disarray. His 17-year-old sister, [[Angelica Hamilton]], suffered a [[mental breakdown]] from which she never recovered; her mental state deteriorated until she became only intermittently lucid, and she sometimes could not even recognize family members. She spent the rest of her life in a state described as \"eternal childhood,\" often talking to her brother as if he were still alive.<ref name=Chernow/>\n\nFriends of the family wrote that Philip's parents never went back to their old selves after the death of their son {{fact|date=April 2020}}. On June 2, 1802, Elizabeth gave birth to their youngest child, with whom she was pregnant at the time of Philip's death. They named the baby [[Philip Hamilton (the second)|Philip Hamilton]], in memory of his older brother.\n\n== In popular culture ==\nIn the 2015 [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] musical ''[[Hamilton (musical)|Hamilton]]'', the role of Philip was originated by [[Anthony Ramos (actor)|Anthony Ramos]].<ref name=IBDB/>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em|refs=\n<ref name=AllanHamilton>{{cite book |first=Allan McLane |last=Hamilton |year=1910 |title=The Intimate Life of Alexander Hamilton |url={{GBurl|id=3TYOAAAAIAAJ|pg=PA210-IA1}} |nopp=y |page=Illustration facing p. 210 |quote=Philip Hamilton (The First) \u2013 Age 20 }}</ref>\n<ref name=Golway2014>{{cite book |last=Golway |first=Terry |title=Machine Made: Tammany Hall and the Creation of Modern American Politics |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Um7nAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA6 |year=2014 |publisher=W.

The Dutch, who desired to control the Johor-Riau Empire, feared losing momentum because of the absence of mere regalia. They therefore ordered Timmerman Tyssen, the Dutch Governor of Malacca, to seize Penyengat in October 1822 and remove the royal regalia from Tengku Hamidah by force. The regalia was then stored in the crown prince's fort in Tanjung Pinang. Engku Puteri was reported to have written a letter to [[Godert van der Capellen|Van Der Capellen]], the Dutch Governor in Batavia, about this issue.

Non-violence and [[Nonviolent resistance|passive resistance]] measures were adopted by the association. The main method of the movement was to hold symbolic boycotts. The Dutch then branded the movement as a passive resistance ([[Dutch language|Dutch]]: ''leidelek verset''), and passive acts such as ignoring the raising of the Dutch flag were met with anger by the [[History of Jakarta|Batavia]]-based ''Raad van Indie'' (Dutch East Indies Council) and the Advisor on Native Affairs, [[Christiaan Snouck Hurgronje]]. Hurgronje wrote a secret letter to the ''Raad van Indie'', advocating that the sultanate and association be crushed as resistance in the earlier [[Aceh War]] had been. Hurgronje justified this with several arguments, among which were that since 1902 the members of the Roesidijah Klub would gather around the royal court and refuse to raise the Dutch flag on government vessels. The Dutch Colonial Resident in Riau, A.L. Van Hasselt advised the [[Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies]] that the Sultan was an opponent to the Dutch and immersed with a group of hardcore resistant.

Dutch direct rule over the Riau Archipelago began in 1913, and the province was administered as part of the Residency of Riau and Dependencies ([[Dutch language|Dutch]]: ''Residentie Riouw en Onderhoorigheden''). The Dutch Residency consisted of [[Tanjung Pinang]], [[Lingga Regency|Lingga]], the [[Riau]] mainland and [[Indragiri River|Indragiri]], while the [[Tudjuh Archipelago]] was administered separately as part of the Pulau-Tujuh Division ([[Dutch language|Dutch]]: ''Afdeeling Poelau-Toedjoeh'').<ref name=\"hubert-herald1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hubert-herald.nl/IndoRiau.htm|title=Riau|date=11 November 2010|publisher=Hubert de Vries|location=[[Amsterdam]]|language=}}</ref>\n\n=== Japanese occupation and Independence ===\n{{Main|Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies|Indonesian National Revolution}}\nWhen [[South-East Asian theatre of World War II|World War II]] broke out, the Dutch initially seemed reluctant to defend their territories in the [[Dutch East Indies|East Indies]].

M. Hassan entitled \"The Singapore heir to the [[Riau Archipelago|Rhio Islands]]\" published in ''[[The Straits Times]]''.]]\nIn the aftermath of the war and the struggle against Dutch rule, several exile associations collectively known as the ''Gerakan Kesultanan Riau'' (Riau Sultanate Movement) emerged in Singapore, planning for a restoration. Some of the groups dated from as early as the dissolution of the sultanate, but started to gain momentum following the post-world war confusion and politics. From the ashes of political uncertainty and fragility in the East Indies following the [[Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies#End of the occupation|World War II]], a [[royalist]] faction known as the Association of the Indigenous Riau Malays ([[Malay language|Malay]]: ''Persatoean Melayu Riouw Sedjati'') (PMRS)  emerged to call for the restoration of the Riau-Lingga Sultanate. The council was financially backed by rich Riau Malay \u00e9migr\u00e9s and Chinese merchants who hoped to obtain tin concession. Initially founded in High Street, Singapore, the association moved to Tanjung Pinang, Riau with the unprecedented approval by the Dutch administrators. Based in Tanjung Pinang, the group managed to gain the consent of the Dutch for [[self-governance]] in the region with the foundation of the Riouw Council ([[Dutch language|Dutch]]: ''Riouw Raad'', [[Malay language|Malay]]: ''Dewan Riouw''). The Riouw Council was the [[devolved]] national [[unicameral]] legislature of Riau, a position equivalent to a [[Parliament]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tanjungpinangpos.co.id/2013/58742/gerakan-sultan-riau-1946-1950-habis/|title=Gerakan Sultan Riau|date=9 February 2013|publisher=Tanjung Pinang Post|location=Tanjung Pinang|language=Indonesian}}</ref>\n\nAfter establishing itself in Tanjung Pinang, the group formed a new organisation known as ''Djawatan Koewasa Pengoeroes Rakjat Riow'' (The Council of Riau People Administration), with the members hailing from [[Tudjuh Archipelago]], [[Great Karimun]], [[Lingga Islands|Lingga]] and [[Singkep]]. This group strongly advocated the restoration of the Riau-Lingga Sultanate after the status of Indonesia became official. The leader of the council, Raja Abdullah, claimed that Riau Malays were neglected at the expense of the non-Riau Indonesians who dominated the upper ranks of the Riau civil administration. By restoring the monarch, they believed the position of Riau Malays would be guarded. The royalist association met with resistance from the [[Republicanism|republican]] group led by Dr. Iljas Datuk Batuah that sent delegates to Singapore to counter the propaganda of sultanate supporters. Based on Indonesian archive records, Dr. Iljas gained approvals from non-Malay newcomers to Riau, including [[Minang people|Minang]], [[Javanese people|Javanese]], [[Palembang]], and [[Batak people]]. He later formed a group known as the ''Badan Kedaulatan Indonesia Riouw'' (BKRI) (Indonesian Riau Sovereign Body) on 8 October 1945. The organisation sought to absorb the Riau Archipelago into the then-[[Indonesian National Revolution|newly independent Indonesia]], as the archipelago was still retained by the Dutch. BKRI hoped that the new administration under [[Soekarno]] would give the [[pribumis]] a fair chance to run the local government.\n\nThe royalist association would not give any public support to the Indonesian movement, as is evident in its refusal to display the ''Bendera Merah-Putih'' ([[Indonesian Flag]]) during the [[Proclamation of Indonesian Independence|Indonesian Independence Day]] celebration on 17 August 1947 in Singapore. This led republicans to call the royalists 'pro-Dutch'. The royalists however, maintained that Riau was a Dutch territory and that only the Dutch could support it. The Dutch countered the claims of the BKRI by granting [[Autonomous administrative division|autonomous rule]] to the Riau Council, in which links with the Dutch would be maintained while a restored sultanate would play a secondary role. The Council, created following the decree of the Governor General of the East Indies on 12 July 1947, was inaugurated on 4 August 1947, and represented a major step forward in the revival of the monarchy system. Several key members of the PMRS were elected to the Riau Council alongside their BKRI rivals, the [[Kapitan Cina|Chinese kapitans]] from Tanjung Pinang and Pulau Tujuh, local Malay leaders of Lingga and Dutch Officials in Tanjung Pinang. On 23 January 1948, the states of the Bangka Council, the Belitung Council, and the Riau Council merged to form the ''Bangka Belitung and Riau Federation''.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=f3iIDAAAQBAJ&pg=PT85&lpg=PT85&dq=federasi+bangka+belitung+dan+riau#v=onepage&q=federasi%20bangka%20belitung%20dan%20riau&f=false|title=Antara Daerah dan Negara: Indonesia Tahun 1950-an|last=Bemmelen|first=Sita van|last2=Raben|first2=Remco|date=2011|publisher=Yayasan Pustaka Obor Indonesia|isbn=9789794617724|language=id}}</ref>\n\nThe call for revival of the sultanate continued throughout the period of autonomous rule under the Riau Council, although the influence of republicanism also continued to strengthen. The appeal of revival began to subside following the dissolution of the ''Bangka Belitung and Riau Federation'' on 4 April 1950. After the official withdrawal by the Dutch in 1950, the Riau Archipelago became ''Keresidenan Riau'' under [[Sumatra|Central Sumatra Province]] following the absorption by the [[United States of Indonesia]]. Being one of the last territories merged into Indonesia, Riau was known as the ''daerah-daerah pulihan'' (recovered regions), and the Riau area became a province in August 1957.\n\nThe leader of Riau forces, Major Raja Muhammad Yunus, who led the bid to reestablish the sultanate apart from Indonesia fled into exile in Johor after his ill attempt.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ck13DAAAQBAJ&pg=PA250&lpg=PA250&dq=Raja+Muhammad+Yunus+riau#v=onepage&q=Raja%20Muhammad%20Yunus%20riau&f=false|title=The SIJORI Cross-Border Region: Transnational Politics, Economics, and Culture|last=Hutchinson|first=Francis E.|last2=Chong|first2=Terence|date=2016-06-14|publisher=ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute|isbn=9789814695589|language=en}}</ref> The [[Geopolitical|geopolitical roots]] of the Riau Archipelago had molded her nationalist position to be sandwiched between the kindred [[Monarchism|monarchist]] Peninsular [[Ethnic Malays#Malay nationalism|Malay Nationalism]] observed across the border in [[British Malaya]] with the [[Republicanism|pro-republic]] and pan-ethnic [[Indonesian National Awakening|Indonesian Nationalism]] manifested in her own [[Dutch East Indies]] domain.\n\n=== Contemporary era ===\n{{Main|Indonesia\u2013Malaysia confrontation}}\nAfter the war, from 1950 the Riau archipelago was a duty-free zone till the [[Indonesia\u2013Malaysia confrontation|Indonesia-Malaysia confrontation]] in 1963.

The sultanate was headed by a [[Sultan]].The Sultan, who was a Malay, acted as [[Head of State]] while the ''Dipertuan Muda/Yamtuan Muda'' (deputy ruler or Viceroy), a position held by the [[Bugis]] ruling elite, served as the [[Head of Government]].  The sultan's royal palace was located in [[Penyengat Island|Penyengat Inderasakti]], while the ''Yang Dipertuan Muda'' resided in [[Daik]], Lingga. After becoming a Dutch protectorate, a Dutch resident was installed as an adviser to the sultan. For the hereditary position of the Sultan, the sultan was fully subjected under the influence of the [[Dutch East Indies]] authority. Albeit he is [[de jure]] on the apex of the monarchy system, he is under the direct control of the Dutch Resident in [[Tanjung Pinang]]. All matters pertaining the administration of the sultanate including the appointment of the Sultan and the ''Yang Dipertuan Muda,'' must be made within the knowledge and even the consent of the Dutch Resident.\n\nAfter the Dutch fully annexed the sultanate, a Dutch resident was posted in Tanjung Pinang, heading the Residency of Riau and Dependencies.

The province shares maritime border with [[Vietnam]] and [[Cambodia]] to the north, the province of [[Bangka Belitung Islands]] and [[Jambi]] in the south, [[East Malaysia]], [[Brunei]] and the province of [[West Kalimantan]] in the east and [[Peninsular Malaysia]], [[Singapore]] and mainland [[Riau]] in the west.\n\nThe island of [[Batam]], which lies within the central core group of islands (the Riau Archipelago), contains a majority of the province's population. Since becoming part of an economic zone with Singapore in 2006, it has experienced high population growth rates. Other highly populated islands in the Riau Archipelago include [[Bintan Island|Bintan]] and [[Great Karimun|Karimun]], while the archipelago also includes islands such as [[Bulan Island|Bulan]] and [[Kundur Island|Kundur]]. There are around 3,200 islands in the province, which has its capital at [[Tanjung Pinang]] in the south of Bintan Island. The Riau Islands province includes the [[Lingga Islands]] to the south of the main [[Riau Archipelago]], while to the northeast lies the [[Tudjuh Archipelago]], between [[Borneo]] and mainland [[Malaysia]]; the Tudjuh Archipelago consists of four distinct groups \u2014 the [[Anambas Islands]], [[Natuna Islands]], [[Tambelan Archipelago|Tambelan]] islands and [[Badas Islands]] \u2014 which were attached to the new province, though not geographically part of the Riau Archipelago.

In November to February monsoon winds comes from the north and between June to December the monsoon winds comes from the south. During the northern monsoon the wind velocity at sea could range from 20-30 knots, on land the wind can range from 3-15 knots. This causes potentially extreme weather in the Riau Islands with rainfall of about 150-200 millimeters and wave height between 1.2 meters up to 3 meters.\nAs in most other province of Indonesia, the Riau Islands has a [[tropical rainforest climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Af'') bordering on a tropical monsoon climate. The climate is very much dictated by the surrounding sea and the prevailing wind system. It has high average temperature and high average rainfall.

It is depends on the different between seawater level in northern part of [[Andaman Sea]] and southern part of Malacca Strait. Since seawater level in [[Pacific Ocean]] is always higher than in [[Indian Ocean|Indian Oceans]], the seawater level in [[South China Sea]] is also higher than in Andaman Sea through out the year resulted in Malacca Strait there is a current, which flow to Northwest direction through out the year. In November to April, during the Northeast monsoon, Andaman Sea\u2019s current goes to the north. Therefore majority of water masses are transported to the north. Consequent of this, during these months, Andaman Sea\u2019s water masses will be empty, and sea water level will be low or the different from South China Sea\u2019s sea water level will be higher. This sea water level reaches to maximum in February to March, while the different of sea water level between Northern and southern parts of Strait is about 50 cm, which resulted current velocity is about 12 cm/sec to Northwest.<ref name=\":8\" /> \n\nConversely, during the southwest monsoon, May to October, most of the currents in western part of [[Andaman Sea]] go to east and south, therefore water masses will be gathering in Andaman Sea. This resulted in that sea water level increases in northern part of [[Strait of Malacca|Malacca Strait]], and the different of sea water level to [[South China Sea]]\u2019s water level will be small, although in southern part of the Strait the sea water level is still higher. During this season, the water current in Malacca Strait flows to the north, with speed is little bit lower. Current velocity reaches to maximum in around [[July]] to [[August]], with speed about 5 cm/sec. Oceanographic pattern is likely to affect the water quality and reef corals in the study sites. Strong wind during the wet monsoon period, for example, could cause water turbulence which affecting on high sediment, especially in coastal areas, and this might be worse with the high sediment run off from surrounding rivers and/or reclamation areas, such as happened in [[Batam]].

During the period 2011-2014, the economic performance of the Riau Islands had an average growth rate of 6.31%.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nIn 2017, the manufacturing sector formed the largest GDP per share in the province, forming around 36.8% of the total GDP per share of the province.<ref name=\"GDP by province 2017\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.bps.go.id/publication/download.html?nrbvfeve=YzM5NjA5ZDdlYmU4NWI3OGM1N2E4NWE2&xzmn=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYnBzLmdvLmlkL3B1YmxpY2F0aW9uLzIwMTgvMDcvMjcvYzM5NjA5ZDdlYmU4NWI3OGM1N2E4NWE2L3Byb2R1ay1kb21lc3Rpay1yZWdpb25hbC1icnV0by1wcm92aW5zaS1wcm92aW5zaS1kaS1pbmRvbmVzaWEtbWVudXJ1dC1sYXBhbmdhbi11c2FoYS0yMDEzLTIwMTcuaHRtbA%3D%3D&twoadfnoarfeauf=MjAxOS0xMC0xNyAxNTo0Mjo1MA%3D%3D|title=Gross Regional Domestic Product of Indonesia by Industry|author=Statistics Indonesia|date=27 July 2018|website=|publisher=|url-status=live|archive-url=|access-date=17 October 2019|author-link=Statistics Indonesia}}</ref> Based on the main commodities, [[Fossil fuel|mineral fuels]], machinery and electrical equipment remain the mainstay trade of the Riau Islands. This type of commodity has not changed significantly compared to previous years. This needs to be considered given the expansion of the market must also be accompanied by an expansion of commodities both in quality and type.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\nThe second largest sector is the [[Construction|construction industry]], forming around 18% of the total GDP sector.<ref name=\"GDP by province 2017\" /> The development of the number of construction businesses in the Riau Islands fluctuated considerably during the period 2008-2010. In 2010 the number of construction companies in the province was 1,570, with the value of construction completed (revenue) of Rp 5,483 billion. Number of National Labor Force Survey Results show that the number of residents working in the construction sector has fluctuated from time to time. As many as 43,232 people were recorded in February 2009, then decreased in February 2010 to 29,932 people, again increased in August 2010 to 50,833 people, then decreased in February 2011 to 58,211 and again increased in August 2011 to 59,755 people. Because the Riau Islands is a new developing province and almost half of the existing human resources come from outside the Riau Islands, this has caused housing needs in the Riau Islands to be out of proportion to their availability. This condition also seems to have caused housing costs to rise in the Riau Islands relatively faster than in other regions. The results of the National Socio-Economic Survey show that on average the expenditure per capita of the population for rental costs/housing contracts is the highest type of expenditure for non-food commodities, and the figure tends to increase every year. This fact is in line with the increasing frequency of commodity rental prices in the Riau Islands.<ref name=\":6\" />\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Indamming van de groeve Sultan Singkep Tin Maatschappij Riouw TMnr 10007347.jpg|left|thumb|Tin mining in [[Singkep]], Lingga Islands]]\nThe third largest sector is the [[mining]] industry.<ref name=\"GDP by province 2017\" /> Riau Islands is the largest [[bauxite]] producing region in Indonesia. This can be seen from the number of bauxite mining companies. Since 2008, the number of bauxite mining companies has always been the highest compared to other mining companies, although the number has always dropped from 2008-2010. In 2009 the number of bauxite companies fell by 37 companies to 32 in 2010. This decline also had an impact on the decline in the number of workers and output produced by this sector. The [[tin]] company is the second largest company in the Riau Islands after bauxite. Tin companies also have the same situation as bauxite companies that are experiencing a decline. The tin company which initially had 25 companies in 2009 decreased to 22 companies in 2010.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\nA small but significant sector in the province is the agriculture sector, forming around 3.5% of the total GDP sector.<ref name=\"GDP by province 2017\" /> Despite having limited agricultural land, and production of food crops (mainly [[rice]]), the Riau Islands have not been able to meet the needs food for its population. This problem is caused by rice productivity that is still low. [[Cassava]] plants have the highest productivity, then [[sweet potato]] and rice plants are ranked third. In 2011, rice productivity in the Riau Islands reached 3.16 tons per hectare, far below the productivity of cassava and sweet potatoes, which amounted to 10.83 tons per hectare and 7.75 tons per hectare, respectively. When viewed from the harvested area and rice production in 2011, it experienced a very small increase as well as productivity. Rice productivity in 2010 was 3.15 tons per hectare, cassava was 10.82 tons per hectare and sweet potatoes was 7.72 tons per hectare. The increase in productivity of rice and cassava was only 0.01 tons per hectare and sweet potatoes was 0.03 tons per hectare. [[Maize|Corn]] and [[peanut]] crops are food crops in Riau Islands with low productivity during 2010-2011. Whereas for corn productivity in 2010 amounted to 2.13 tons per hectare decreased to 2.12 tons per hectare in 2011. While for peanuts the productivity remained, at 0.92 tons per hectare. Decrease in corn productivity is due to the harvested area for maize also has decreased, besides it is also the effect of pests that cause disruption of corn pests.<ref name=\":6\" /> Plantation and horticultural crops are types of plants that are quite potential to be cultivated in Riau Islands. This is based on the high price of agricultural products produced by these two types of businesses. As shown by the NTP (Farmer Exchange Rate) data, only estate and horticultural farmers have almost certainly an index value above 100. This condition is of course caused by the still higher price of goods produced by farmers compared to the price of goods needed, both for consumption and the cost of production. Production of [[Natural rubber|rubber]] plants in 2011 experienced a very high increase of 118 percent. While [[coconut]] plants experienced a very small increase of 2.4 percent. As for fruit production, in 2011, only [[jackfruit]] and [[banana]] increased, where [[jackfruit]] production increased by 5 percent and banana production increased by 50 percent, compared to production in 2010. As for the production of [[pineapple]], [[durian]], [[Orange (fruit)|orange]] and [[rambutan]] decreased in 2011.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\nThe island of [[Natuna Regency|Natuna]] located in the north-eastern part of the province is home to the largest [[natural gas field]] in Indonesia (estimated to 1.3 billion m<sup>3</sup>).

It served as the ''[[lingua franca]]'' of the province.\n\nThe [[Karimun Regency]] has several dialects namely the Kundur dialect and the Bintan-Karimun dialect. In general, it uses the Johor-Riau dialect. The main characteristic of this dialect is the suffix \"A\" which sounds as \"E\". The word /saya/ and /apa/ (\"I\" and \"What\" respectively) will be pronounced as /saye/ and /ape/ in the Johor-Riau dialect, which is similar to the Malay used in [[Peninsular Malaysia]]. The dialects used in the [[Bintan Regency]] are the Bintan-Karimun dialect, the Malang Rapat-Kelong dialect which is used in Malang Rapat village and Kelong village and the Mantang Lama dialect in Mantang Lama Village in Kijang. The word pronunciation is similar to the Malay used in Tanjung Pinang and Karimun. The Malay used in the [[Lingga Regency]] is also similar to the Malay used in the Karimun and BIitan Regency. The variety of Malay spoken in the province's northernmost regencies, [[Anambas Islands Regency|Anambas]] and [[Natuna Regency|Natuna]], is not only mutually unintelligible to the standard Indonesian language, but also mutually unintelligible to the Malay varieties spoken in Bintan and Karimun. The Anambas Malay dialect slightly resembles the [[Pontianak Malay]] dialect spoken in [[West Kalimantan]] and the Belitung Malay dialect spoken in [[Bangka Belitung Islands|Bangka-Belitung]], especially their vocabulary and phonology. For example, ''kitak'' or ''ketak'' which means you, ''wan'' which means grandma and ''suduk'' which means spoon are both used in Anambas and Pontianak. The Natuna Malay people spoke a dialect of Malay that is influenced by [[Terengganu Malay]] and [[Pahang Malay]] that are spoken in the Malaysian states of [[Terengganu]] and [[Pahang]] respectively, as most of the people living there trace their origins from the eastern coast of the [[Malay Peninsula]]. Historically, the Anambas and Natuna Malays spoke the [[Terengganu Malay]], but its speakers (mostly elderly) are rapidly diminishing and replaced by the local Malay dialects on the islands.<ref>[http://www.mstar.com.my/lain-lain/rencana/2013/12/07/kepulauan-natuna-bergeografikan-malaysia-berdaulatkan-indonesia/ The Natuna Islands: Geographically Malaysian, politically Indonesian], mstar.com.my. 7 December 2013 (in Malay)</ref> The ''[[Orang Laut|Orang laut]]'' people also spoke their own variety of Malay which is still related to the Malay spoken in the Batam-Bintan area.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.genpi.co/hits-style/7443/kepulauan-riau-beda-tempat-lain-dialek-melayunya|title=GenPI.co|website=GenPI.co|language=id|access-date=2019-08-14}}</ref>\n\nTraditionally, the Malay language is written in [[Jawi script]] (locally known in Indonesia as \"Arab-Melayu\"), an Arabic-based writing.<ref>{{cite book|title=How complex are isolating languages?|last=Gil|first=David|publisher=Benjamins|year=2008|editor1-last=Miestamo|editor1-first=Matti|series=Language complexity: Typology, contact, change (Studies in Language Companion Series 94)|location=Amsterdam|pages=109\u2013131|editor2-last=Sinnem\u00e4ki|editor2-first=Kaius|editor3-last=Karlsson|editor3-first=Fred}}</ref> However, the use of Jawi is diminishing rapidly, being replaced by the [[Latin script]] introduced by the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] during the [[Dutch East Indies|colonial era]].

The Riau Islands Hokkien is related  to the Hokkien spoken in mainland Riau, such as the town of [[Bagansiapiapi]] and [[Selat Panjang]], as well as the Hokkien spoken in Central and Southern [[Peninsular Malaysia]] and [[Singapore]]. Together, they are known as the [[Southern Malaysia Hokkien]]. This dialect is based on the [[Quanzhou dialect]], which originated from the city of [[Quanzhou]] in [[Fujian]], [[China]]. It is markedly distinct from [[Penang Hokkien]] and [[Medan Hokkien]], which are based on [[Zhangzhou dialect]], another Hokkien dialect originated from the city of [[Zhangzhou]], also in Fujian. Other varieties of Chinese are also spoken in the province, such as [[Teochew dialect|Teochew]], [[Hainanese]], [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]] and [[Cantonese]], albeit to a lesser extent compared to Hokkien. Hokkien serves as the ''lingua franca'' of the Chinese people in the Riau Islands. Most of the Chinese varieties spoken in the region has been greatly influenced by [[Malay language|Malay]] and [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]], especially their vocabulary.\n\nOther ethnic groups who migrated from other parts of Indonesia brought their own language, such as the [[Javanese language]] spoken by the [[Javanese people|Javanese]], [[Minangkabau language]] spoken by the [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]] and different varieties of [[Batak languages|Batak]] spoken by different sub-groups of the [[Batak]] people.\n\n[[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] is widely used as the national language. Most formal [[education]], and nearly all national [[mass media]], [[governance]], [[Public administration|administration]], [[judiciary]], and other forms of communication in the Riau Islands, are conducted in Indonesian. It is also used for inter-ethnic communication. Indonesian is spoken as the first language in major cities such as [[Batam]] and [[Tanjung Pinang]], while it is spoken as a second language elsewhere in the province. The [[Chinese Indonesians|Chinese people]] in the Riau Islands uses Indonesian as their third language, with Hokkien or other [[Varieties of Chinese|Chinese varieties]] being used as their first language and the local Riau Malay as their second language.\n\n=== Religion ===\n{{bar box|width=250px|barwidth=100px|title=Religion in the Riau Islands (2016)<ref name=\"Kemenag2016\">{{cite web| title = Riau Islands Religion Profile in 2016 | work =  [[Ministry of Religious Affairs (Indonesia)|Indonesian Ministry of Religious Affairs]] | year = 2016 |url = https://kepri.kemenag.go.id/public/files/040920170319221988430497.pdf}}</ref>|titlebar=#ddd|left1=Religion|right1=Percent|float=right|bars=\n{{bar percent|[[Islam]]|Green|77.56}}\n{{bar percent|[[Christianity]]|Violet|14.67}}\n{{bar percent|[[Buddhism]]|Yellow|7.55}}\n{{bar percent|[[Confucianism]]|Black|0.17}}\n{{bar percent|[[Hinduism]]|Magenta|0.05}}}}The local Malay people of the Riau region since ancient times and even until the present-day is considered as a society that is accommodating, friendly, and welcome to immigrants who come to bring new cultures and religions, both from within and outside the country. The example are immigrants from [[India]] with [[Hinduism]], from [[China]] with [[Buddhism]] and [[Confucianism]], from [[Europe]] with [[Christianity]] and [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]], as well as other migrants from various ethnic groups in the [[Nusantara]] archipelago.  Based on the composition of the population of the Riau Islands which is full of diversity with different socio-cultural, linguistic and religious backgrounds, it is basically an asset for the Riau Archipelago itself. The religions embraced by the inhabitants of the province are very diverse, including [[Islam]], [[Protestantism]], [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]], [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], and [[Confucianism]].\n\nAs of 2016, [[Islam]] is the dominant religion in the province, forming 77.56% of the total population. [[Islam]] is generally adhered by the ethnic [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malays]], [[Javanese people|Javanese]], [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]], [[Banjar people|Banjars]], [[Bugis]], [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] and some [[Batak]] sub-group. Islam has entered the region since at least the [[12th century]]. Contact between the indigenous population and Muslim traders from the [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabian peninsula]], [[Iran|Persia]] and India did occur for the first time in the northern Sumatra region because of its strategic position to traders stopover at that time. This condition strengthens the indication that the [[Islamization]] process is expected to have taken place since the contact took place so that a community was formed where the Arabs who settled in the village were married to local residents thus forming Muslim communities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://media.neliti.com/media/publications/164474-ID-islamisasi-di-riau-kajian-sejarah-dan-bu.pdf|title=Islamization in Riau: Historical and Cultural Study of the entry and the development of Islam in Kuntu Kampar|last=Roza|first=Ellya|last2=Yasnel|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=1 October 2019}}</ref> [[Islam]] is generally adhered by the ethnic [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malays]], [[Javanese people|Javanese]], [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]], [[Banjar people|Banjars]], [[Bugis]], [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] and some [[Batak]] sub-group. Several Muslim organizations in Indonesia has branches in the Riau Islands, such as [[Muhammadiyah]] and the [[Nahdlatul Ulama]].\n\n[[Christianity]] forms the second-largest religion group in the province, forming around 14.67% of the total population. The two largest Christian domination in the Riau Islands are [[Protestantism]] and [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]], forming around 12.21% and 2.46% of the total population respectively. Most of the people who adhered Protestantism are from [[Batak]] sub-groups (specifically [[Toba Batak people|Batak Toba]], [[Karo people (Indonesia)|Karo]] and [[Simalungun people|Simalungun]]), [[Nias people|Nias]], [[Chinese Indonesians|Chinese]], and immigrants from [[North Sulawesi]], [[Maluku Islands|Maluku]] and [[Western New Guinea|Papua]], while most of the people who adhered Catholicism are immigrants from [[East Nusa Tenggara]]. The province does not has its own Catholic [[Diocese]]. Instead, it is served by the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Pangkal-Pinang]], which is based in [[Pangkal Pinang|Pangkal-Pinang]], [[Bangka Belitung Islands]].\n\n[[Buddhism]] and [[Confucianism]] forms a significant minority in the province, forming around 7.55% and 0.17% respectively. They are mostly adhered by the Chinese. Lastly, [[Hinduism]] only forms around 0.05% of the total population, which is mostly adhered by [[Balinese people|Balinese]] immigrants and [[Indian Indonesians|Indonesians of Indian descent]].\n\n== Culture ==\nThe culture of the Riau Islands is strongly influenced by the culture of the [[Malay culture|Malays]] and the Chinese people. Some ethnic groups, for example Javanese, Balinese, Bugis, Batak, and European culture also influenced the culture of the province. The culture of the Riau Islands is also influenced by the [[Islamic culture|culture of Islam]]. The Malay people that inhabits Riau Islands is also overwhelmingly adhered to Islam. In addition to Islam, the culture of the Riau Islands has also been influenced by the other religions, such as [[Buddhism]], [[Christianity]] and [[Confucianism]]. However, as the Riau Islands is considered as the home of the Malay people and part of the [[Malay world]], the culture of the Riau Islands mostly relate to the culture of the Malay people themselves.\n\nWhat is typical of the Malay people is the designation of a nickname for a specific person in a family. The first child in a Malay family is called ''long'' or ''sulung'', the second child is called ''ngah''/''ongah'', the third child is called ''cik'' and the youngest child is called ''cu/ucu''. The nickname is usually followed by a word that describes the physical characteristics of the person concerned, for example ''cik'' ''itam,'' which means a third child with a dark/black characteristic. This culture can only be found in the Riau Malay community, both in the Riau Islands as well as mainland Riau.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ilmuseni.com/seni-budaya/kebudayaan-suku-melayu|title=Kebudayaan Suku Melayu yang Paling Fenomenal|last=Antono|first=Agil|date=2017-12-28|website=IlmuSeni.com|language=id|access-date=2019-10-02}}</ref>\n\nA typical Riau Malay ''[[Kampong|kampung]]'' (village) are led by a village chief called the ''penghulu''. Presently, the ''penghulu'' is a village administrator chosen based on government regulations. Besides the ''penghulu'' there is also a leader in the religious sector called ''[[imam]]''. This ''imam'' takes care of all matters relating to religion, such as religious studies and lessons, marriage/ divorce/reconciliation, the distribution of inheritance, collection of [[zakat]] and others. Thus the ''penghulu'' accompanied by the ''imam'' are the leader of the ''kampung''.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web |last=Annisa|first=Pahlevi|title=Kebudayaan-melayu-riau |url=https://www.academia.edu/7535760 |website=Academia |language=id}}</ref>\n\nIn the ''kampung'', most of the local people knew each other, because the villagers had a strong sense of attachment to each other. Harmony is a characteristic of the community of these ''kampung''. The existence of harmony is not caused by external coercion in the form of harsh sanctions, but it does arise from a conscience that is influenced by the norms that live in the community. Starting from the movements, attitudes and traits are influenced by these factors. Avoiding things that can cause disgrace and shame is a motivating factor for continuing to act and be kind to others and such feelings are stronger than feelings of sin. All actions must be maintained so as not to cause \"discordant eyes\", \"discordant ears\", \"discordant manners\".<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Arts and Performance===\n[[File:Joget-Dangkong.jpg|thumb|A troupe of local Riau Malay dancers performing the [[Joget|Joget Lambak]]. (taken in the late 19th century)]]\nVarious forms and types of arts found in the Riau region, namely theater, dance, music, singing, and literature. Artists in urban areas generally feel alien to traditional arts. Therefore, an appreciative link is needed by introducing all types and forms of traditional arts in urban areas. Thus, contemporary art that grows, lives, and develops in urban areas will have a solid and tidy foundation in contributing to national art.\n\nIn the late 1890s, the Rusydiah Club was founded, an association for scholars, writers, and cultural figures.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/323835285|title=The Rushdiah Club: Its roles in Malay Societies, 1892-1940|last=Zakariya|first=Hafiz|last2=Oktasari|first2=Wiwin|date=2017-12-29|isbn=9789674186319}}</ref> This association was established in the Riau Islands, precisely on [[Penyengat Island]] which at that time was the center of the government of the [[Riau-Lingga Sultanate|Sultanate of Riau-Lingga]]. In essence, this association is a cultural institution that includes art, performance and literature. Its activities began with the commemoration of Islamic holidays, such as [[Mawlid|Maulud Nabi]], [[Isra and Mi'raj|Isra-Mikraj]], [[History of the Quran|Nuzulul Quran]], [[Eid al-Fitr|Eid al-Fit]]<nowiki/>r, [[Eid al-Adha]], and others which later developed to the publication of books by members of the association. All activities are supported by royal facilities in the form of the Marah Ahmadi Khanah Polar library and two [[Jawi alphabet|Jawi]] printing presses, namely Mathba\u2018at al Ahmadiyah and Mathba\u2018at al Riauwiyah.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kebudayaan.kemdikbud.go.id/bpnbkepri/makam-merah-dan-alias-wello/|title=Makam Merah dan Alias Wello|last=dediarman|date=2016-12-29|website=Balai Pelestarian Nilai Budaya Kepulauan Riau|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-02}}</ref> The Rusydiah Klub is the first association of scholars in Indonesia. This association is not mentioned in national history, because of the lack of careful collection of historical material, or maybe because there is no input from those who know much about it. Rusydiah Club left behind a valuable heritage of creativity in the form of books of literature, religion, history and linguistics.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nThe Riau region has long been an area of trade traffic in neighboring countries, so Riau has given birth to diverse cultural figures and colors. This is a burden, as well as a historical-geographical blessing. Riau seems to be a field of association of various artistic potentials, in which there are cultural influences in neighboring countries and other Indonesian cultures. Riau Malay art is very diverse, because small groups that exist in the community are also developing.<ref name=\":2\" /> The fact shows, the arts in Riau and the arts in Malay countries such as [[Malaysia]], [[Singapore]] and [[Brunei|Brunei Darussalam]] mutually complement and influence each other. Likewise, Malay cultural regions such as [[Sultanate of Deli|Deli]], [[Sultanate of Langkat|Langkat]], [[Serdang Malays|Serdang]] and [[Asahan Sultanate|Asahan]] in [[North Sumatra]], [[Jambi]], [[West Kalimantan]], and others, were also affected by the [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]], [[Mandailing people|Mandailing]], [[Buginese people|Bugis]] and [[Javanese people|Javanese]] cultures. Cultures influence that come from outside Indonesia such as [[India]] ([[Hindus|Hindu]]-[[Buddhism|Buddhist]]), [[Arabs|Arabic]] ([[Islam]]), [[Chinese culture|Chinese]], and [[Thai culture|Siamese]] influence. The flexibility of Malay culture is in line with the historical development and geographical location of Riau, making Riau very rich with a variety of artistic expressions. The development of Malay culture in Riau, in turn, can enrich national culture.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n''[[Baju Kurung|Baju kurung]]'' is one of the traditional clothes of the Malay community in [[Brunei]], [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], [[Singapore]], and [[southern Thailand]]. ''[[Baju Kurung|Baju kurung]]'' is often associated with women. The hallmark of the clothes brackets is the loose design on the holes in the arms, abdomen, and chest. When worn, the bottom of the clothes bracket is parallel to the groin, but for rare cases there are also those that extend to knee level. Shirt brackets are not fitted with buttons, but are almost similar to t-shirts. Shirt brackets are also not collared, each end is crochet. Some parts are often decorated with gold embroidery. At first, the clothes of the brackets were usually worn for the great ceremony of Malay by women in the kingdom, used together with ''[[songket]]'' cloth to be used as a scabbard, various gold jewelry, and a small bag or fan. Since the majority of Malay communities embraced [[Islam]], many women who wear clothes in brackets match them with the [[hijab]], although there are also those who do not use them. Now the clothes of brackets are widely worn by ordinary people, used by children to read the [[Quran]], or ladies to go to the market, without including accessories that seem luxurious.\n\nHowever, the main traditional dress of the people of the Riau Islands is the ''[[Kebaya]] Labuh'' and the ''Teluk Belanga.''<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.raparapa.co/pakaian-adat/|title=34 Pakaian Adat di Indonesia, Kekayaan yang Masih Dilestarikan|last=Raparapa|date=2017-01-13|website=Raparapa|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-17}}</ref> The ''[[Kebaya]] Labuh a''re specifically worn by women. It is typically worn at the time of traditional ceremonies and official events of the local community. The hallmark of ''Kebaya Labuh'' and ''Teluk Belangga'' traditional clothing is the length of the kebaya to cover the knees with the shape of the kebaya looking wide and open. ''Kebaya Labuh'' is often combined with [[batik]] cloth such as cual fabric. For the wedding, the groom wore a head covering called ''[[Tengkolok|Tanjak]]''. The spindle is a rectangular [[songket]] that is folded into a headband. A distinctive feature of the ''Teluk Belanga'' custom clothing is a plain color paired with shades of color, a sheath worn over the knee that acts as a scarf, a headband made of songket cloth called the ''tanjak''. The custom attire of ''Kebaya Labuh'' and ''Teluk Belangga'' is complemented by a headdress called a peak which is a head covering made of square ''songket'' shaped like songkok or peci.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bp-guide.id/AXOkKPew|title=9+ Ragam Baju Adat Sumatera Yang Keren dan Wajib Kamu Tahu (2018)|website=BP Guide - Temukan hadiah terbaikmu|language=id|access-date=2019-04-18}}</ref> Typically, the skirt is only used for formal ceremonies or events such as feasts and custom ceremonies. However, these decorations are usually only worn on formal occasions such as death or marriage. Occasionally, ''Teluk Belangga'' clothing is usually accompanied by a ''[[Songkok|peci]]''. For women, the ''Kebaya Labuh'' is usually combined with batik and also with a scarf.\n[[File:Raiyani Muharramah-Silat pengantin.jpg|thumb|Malay men performing the ''Silat Pengantin'' traditional dance in a wedding ceremony at [[Lingga Regency|Lingga Islands]]]]\nThe ''[[Mak yong]]'' is one of the traditional dances that can be found in the Riau Islands. ''Mak Yong'' is a traditional theatrical art of the Malay community which is still sustainable today. Although it is not often performed, every service is always welcomed by enthusiastic residents, especially those who love Malay culture and native art. ''Mak Yong'' performances are usually performed by groups of dancers and musicians, who combine various religious elements, theatrical, dance, music, vocals and texts. The main characters are male and female, both are performed by female dancers. The ''Mak yong'' performance is accompanied by musical instruments such as fiddle and drums.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://kepri-travel.kepriprov.go.id/item/makyong/|title=MAKYONG {{!}} Wonderful Kepri - Official Site|language=id-ID|access-date=2019-10-04}}</ref> In the Riau Islands region, the ''Mak Yong'' oral tradition has been exhibited since several centuries ago and has spread to [[Bangka Island|Bangka]], [[Johor]], [[Malacca]] and [[Penang]]. In the Riau Islands, this oral tradition developed rapidly during the sultanate era. ''Mak yong'' theater performing arts is played with dances, songs and jokes that are intertwined in a story line, the players are 20 people, women wearing glittering costumes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kebudayaan.kemdikbud.go.id/ditwdb/makyong-kepulauan-riau-seni-pertujukkan/|title=Makyong Kepulauan Riau, Seni Pertujukkan|last=ditwdb|date=2019-04-30|website=Direktorat Warisan dan Diplomasi Budaya|language=id-ID|access-date=2019-10-04}}</ref>\n\n''[[Zapin]]'' is a Malay traditional dance that can be found in both the Riau Islands and mainland. This dance is one of several types of Malay dance that still exists today. According to history, in the beginning this dance was a dance of entertainment in the palace after being brought from [[Hadhramaut|Hadramaut]] in [[Yemen]] by Arab traders in the early [[16th century|16th century.]] At that time the country of [[Johor]] became a substitute for the role of [[Malacca]] as an international port in the 16th century. This can be seen from the development of ''Zapin'' dance creations that are identical with Malay culture and in terms of rhyming. Artists and culture are able to make traditional art, not stopping but full of dynamics that are always acceptable in every circumstance. This traditional dance is both educational and entertaining, and is used as an Islamic [[Dawah|da'wah]] medium through ''Zapin'' songs that are sung. The accompanying music consists of fiddles, tambourines, drums and small drum percussion instruments called [[Mirwas|marwas]] or maracas. The ''Zapin'' dance focuses more on teamwork rather than individual efforts. Before the 1960s, ''Zapin'' was only performed by male dancers but now it is usually danced by female dancers or both male and female.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kebudayaan.kemdikbud.go.id/bpnbkepri/tari-zapin/|title=Tari Zapin|last=dediarman|date=2014-06-08|website=Balai Pelestarian Nilai Budaya Kepulauan Riau|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-04}}</ref>\n\nThe ''Malemang'' dance is a traditional Riau dance by the people of [[Bintan Island|Bintan]]. It originated back in the [[12th century]] in Tanjungpisau. Originally, it was only performed at the Royal Palace of the Kingdom of Bentan in Bukit Batu, Bintan. As the kingdom collapsed, this dance became a folk entertainment show. At present, ''Malemang'' Dance is displayed in various events, including festivals. In the show, the dancers demonstrate their ability to take something (handkerchief, change, etc.). They do this by flexing (standing up, bending backwards). From this skill then this dance is called ''malemang'' or ''melemang''. In Tanjungpisau, this dance is better known as the ''Melemang Bintan Penaga'' Dance.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://blogkulo.com/daftar-10-tarian-daerah-riau-kepri/|title=Daftar 10 Nama Tarian Daerah Riau & Kepulauan Riau untuk Anda Ketahui|last=Kulo|first=oleh Blog|date=2019-05-25|website=Blog Kulo|language=id-ID|access-date=2019-10-04}}</ref>\n\n===Architecture===\n[[File:TMII Riau Pavilion Malay House 02.jpg|thumb|A typical Malay traditional house in the [[Taman Mini Indonesia Indah]], Jakarta]]\nIn [[Malay culture]], the art of development also has characteristics that are reflected in the symbols of traditional houses that are full of meaning. At present, Malay traditional houses can still be found in several regions in the [[Riau Archipelago]], [[Peninsular Malaysia]], [[Brunei]] and other [[Malay world|Malay-populated countries]]. In traditional Malay society, a house is an intact building that can be used as a family residence, meeting place and shelter for anyone in need. Therefore, traditional Malay houses are generally large, usually with six poles, six porch poles and twelve poles or porch houses. Of the several forms of the house, all are almost identical, both stairs, doors, walls and room layout are identical. In addition to being large, the Malay house is also always in the form of a stage or a house with a hole, facing towards the sunrise. In general, the types of Malay houses include dwellings, halls, houses of worship and storage houses. The naming is adjusted to the function of each building.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gpswisataindonesia.info/2013/12/rumah-adat-riau-dan-kepulauan-riau/|title=Rumah Adat Riau dan Kepulauan Riau|last=admin|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-03}}</ref>\n\nRiau Malay traditional house buildings are generally given a variety of decorations, starting from the door, window, ventilation to the top of the roof of the building, the decoration is adjusted to the meaning of each carving.  Additionally, these houses are also given a pattern. The pattern of a [[Riau Malays|Riau Malay]] house is largely derived from nature, consisting of flora, fauna, and space objects. These things are designed in certain forms, either in their original form such as backdrops, forest flowers, or in abstracted or modified forms so that they no longer appear in their original form, but simply use their name.\n\nThe ''Limas Potong'' house is one of the traditional houses of the Malays inhabiting the [[Riau Archipelago]].<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://situsbudaya.id/rumah-limas-potong-batam/|title=Rumah Limas Potong Batam|date=2017-11-30|website=Informasi Situs Budaya Indonesia|language=id-ID|access-date=2019-10-03}}</ref> ''Limas Potong'' is a stilt house, like a traditional house in [[Sumatra]] in general.

The doors, windows and pillars on the front of the house are painted in white oil. ''Limas Potong'' has five main parts, namely terrace, front room, center, back (bed), and kitchen. The front of the house is used to display historical photographs of this traditional house, the living room contains a typical Malay bridal diorama, and the back is a room that contains a mosquito net that integrates with the kitchen.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nOne of the most famous traditional house of the people of the Riau Islands is the ''Belah Bubung'' traditional house. This house is also known as the ''Rabung'' house or the ''Bumbung Melayu'' house. The name ''Belah Bubung'' was given by the Malays because the shape of the roof was split. The size of the house built is determined by the ability of its owner, the richer a person is, the bigger the house and the more variety of decoration. However, wealth is not an absolute determinant. The most important consideration in making a home is harmony with the owner. To determine whether or not a house is compatible, the owner calculates the size of the house by cubits, from one to five. The veins are: snake swimming, pursuing ripples, ripples climbing beetles shelter, debt out of debt changed debt, and five debt has not been affected. The best measure is if it is right on the count of ripples to climb the shade beetle.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n===Traditional weapon===\n''Badik Tumbuk Lado'' is a traditional weapon originating from the Riau Islands. ''[[Badik]]'' itself is a term for traditional weapons which is known among the Bugis community and some regions in [[Sumatra]]. Meanwhile, Tumbuk Lada is a traditional weapon of the [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay people]]. No wonder the ''Badik Tumbuk Lado'' has similarities with weapons from other Malay-populated region. The Riau Islands are inhabited by various races and ethnicity. However, the majority of indigenous people are Malay people. Therefore, the culture of the Riau region has a lot in common with other indigenous Malay regions.  ''Badik Tumbuk Lado'' is a type of stabbing weapon measuring 27 to 29 cm and its width is around 3.5 to 4 cm. This weapon is not only used by the people of [[Jambi]], and also has similarities with the [[Buginese people|Buginese]] ''Badik'', it only differs in the shape and motive of the holster. Not only domestically, Malaysia also has the same traditional weapons, both in name and form. This is inseparable from the background of Malay communities spread throughout [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], the [[Philippines]], [[Vietnam]] and along the Malay peninsula. Similar to the ''[[Kris|keris]]'', ''badik'' is also one of the identities that characterizes the Malay people. Until now the ''Badik Tumbuk Lado'' is still used by the people of the Riau islands to do production work such as farming or hunting. Some local customs also still maintain the ''badik'' as a complement to men's custom clothing.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gpswisataindonesia.info/2014/09/senjata-tradisional-kepulauan-riau/|title=Senjata Tradisional Kepulauan Riau|last=admin|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-04}}</ref>\n\nThe ''Jenawi'' is a type of sword that became the most popular traditional weapon in the Riau area. This sword was often used by Malay warlords in the face of his enemies. The sword has a length of about 1 meter so it is often used for close combat. ''Jenawi'' sword is similar to a typical Japanese [[katana]]. Historians and cultural experts argue that this weapon originated from ancient Japan which experienced acculturation with Malay culture. Regardless of this opinion, the sword of genius remains a Malay people's identity on the national scene.\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n{{Main|Malay cuisine}}\n[[File:Nasi Lemak Sambal Cumi in Indonesia 2.jpg|thumb|[[Nasi lemak|Nasi Lemak]] Sambal Cumi, a variety of Nasi Lemak that can be found in the Riau Islands ]]\nCuisine in the Riau Islands are mostly similar to the one in [[Peninsular Malaysia]], owing to its similar culture.

The Riau islands traditional nasi lemak is quite similar to Malaysian version; it comes as a platter of coconut rice wrapped in banana leaf, with cucumber slices, small dried anchovies (''ikan bilis''), roasted peanuts, hard boiled egg, and hot spicy sauce (''sambal'').<ref name=\"Kepri\" /> The Riau islands version however, comes with an addition of small fish locally known as ''ikan tamban'', usually fried with ''[[sambal]]'' chili paste and very crispy, the whole fish is edible.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://batam.tribunnews.com/2015/05/28/kedai-kopi-jalan-bintan-hadir-dengan-konsep-berbeda|title=Kedai Kopi Jalan Bintan Hadir dengan Konsep Berbeda|author=Aminuddin|date=28 May 2015|newspaper=Tribunnews|accessdate=8 June 2015|language=Indonesian}}</ref> [[Prawn|Prawns]] and [[Squid|squids]] are also commonly stir-fried in chili paste as ''sambal udang'' or ''sambal cumi''. \n\n<br /><gallery class=\"center\" mode=\"packed\" caption=\"Cuisine of the Riau Islands\">\nFile:Nasi Campur Tionghoa-Indonesia Khas Kepulauan Riau.jpg|''Nasi Campur'', commonly consumed by the Chinese community in the Riau Islands\nFile:Sop Ikan Batam.jpg|''Sop Ikan Batam'' (Batam Fish Soup), a dish native to the city of [[Batam]]\nFile:Sop Ikan Asam Pedas Batam.jpg|''[[Asam pedas|Sop Asam Pedas]],'' a Malay-Minangkabau dish \nFile:Siput Gonggong.jpg|''Siput Gongong'', a common dish in Batam made of ''[[Laevistrombus canarium]]''\n</gallery>[[File:Johor laksa.JPG|left|thumb|[[Laksa]] Johor in Malaysia, similar to the one found in the Riau Islands]]Another notable dish that can be found in the Riau Islands is the [[laksa]]. Laksa or Lakse in local dialect is a kind of noodle food mixed with typical Chinese and Malay spice blend. Lakse has a round white and slightly thick noodle shape. The name of lakse is taken from Sanskrit which has a lot meaning. It shows that lute noodle is made with various spices. Lakse in the Riau Islands presented in several kinds, one of which is a typical Anambas lakse which is included in the category of lakse curry with a fatty and spicy sauce and rich in spices. One of the most typical mackerel soups of Batam, popularly known as the Batam Fish Soup ([[Indonesian language|Indonesian]]: ''Sup Ikan Batam''). This Batam Fish soup is served with a slice of mackerel fish that had previously been separated from its bones. This piece of fish is smeared with egg whites to remove the fishy smell, then cooked with spices and mixed with starfruit and green tomatoes. Pieces of white or green mustard greens are also incorporated into this soup.\n\nThe [[Bak kut teh]] (\u8089\u9aa8\u8336) is another dish found in the Riau Islands, usually consumed by the Chinese people in the province. the dish can only be found in the region as well as neighboring Singapore and Malaysia. Bak kut teh means meat tea bone. ''Bak kut'' itself is pork ribs, while the word ''teh'', which means tea in [[Hokkien]], comes from either the dish brown sauce which is similar to the color of a tea, or that it was originally served with tea to mollify the taste.. This gravy is a pork broth, with spices such as garlic and strong pepper.\n\nSnacks and drinks such as the [[teh tarik]] and [[curry puff]] can also be found in the province. Teh Tarik is not originally an original beverage from the Riau Islands. This drink is familiar in Southeast Asia especially easily found in [[Malaysia]] and [[Singapore]]. However, in the Riau Islands, such as [[Batam]], [[Tanjung Pinang]] and Tanjung Balai Karimun, this drink is commonly availabe everywhere.The condition of the Riau Islands, which is close to Malaysia and Singapore has made Teh Tarik to spread around the Riau Islands.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kebudayaan.kemdikbud.go.id/bpnbkepri/teh-tarik-ala-kepri/|title=Teh Tarik Ala Kepri|last=dediarman|date=2018-12-20|website=Balai Pelestarian Nilai Budaya Kepulauan Riau|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-21}}</ref> Curry puff, also known as ''epok-epok'' in the local Riau Islands Malay, is a famous local snack that can be commonly found everywhere in the province.

The reluctant Abdul Rahman, believing he was not the rightful heir, decided to move from Lingga to [[Terengganu]], claiming that he wanted to celebrate his marriage. The Dutch, who desired to control the Johor-Riau Empire, feared losing momentum because of the absence of mere regalia. They therefore ordered Timmerman Tyssen, the Dutch Governor of Malacca, to seize Penyengat in October 1822 and remove the royal regalia from Tengku Hamidah by force. The regalia was then stored in the crown prince's fort in Tanjung Pinang. Engku Puteri was reported to have written a letter to [[Godert van der Capellen|Van Der Capellen]], the Dutch Governor in Batavia, about this issue. With the royal regalia in Dutch hands, Abdul Rahman was invited from Terengganu and proclaimed as the Sultan of Johor, Riau-Lingga and Pahang on 27 November 1822. Hence, the legitimate ruler of the Johor-Riau Empire was now Abdul Rahman, rather than the British-backed Hussein.{{sfn|Trcocki, 2007}}\n\nThis led to the [[Partition (politics)|partition]] of Johor-Riau under the Anglo-Dutch treaty of 1824, by which the region north of the [[Singapore Strait]] including the island of Singapore and Johor were to be under British influence, while the south of the strait along with Riau and Lingga were to be controlled by the Dutch.

Hurgronje wrote a secret letter to the ''Raad van Indie'', advocating that the sultanate and association be crushed as resistance in the earlier [[Aceh War]] had been. Hurgronje justified this with several arguments, among which were that since 1902 the members of the Roesidijah Klub would gather around the royal court and refuse to raise the Dutch flag on government vessels. The Dutch Colonial Resident in Riau, A.L. Van Hasselt advised the [[Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies]] that the Sultan was an opponent to the Dutch and immersed with a group of hardcore resistant.

Dutch direct rule over the Riau Archipelago began in 1913, and the province was administered as part of the Residency of Riau and Dependencies ([[Dutch language|Dutch]]: ''Residentie Riouw en Onderhoorigheden''). The Dutch Residency consisted of [[Tanjung Pinang]], [[Lingga Regency|Lingga]], the [[Riau]] mainland and [[Indragiri River|Indragiri]], while the [[Tudjuh Archipelago]] was administered separately as part of the Pulau-Tujuh Division ([[Dutch language|Dutch]]: ''Afdeeling Poelau-Toedjoeh'').<ref name=\"hubert-herald1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hubert-herald.nl/IndoRiau.htm|title=Riau|date=11 November 2010|publisher=Hubert de Vries|location=[[Amsterdam]]|language=}}</ref>\n\n=== Japanese occupation and Independence ===\n{{Main|Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies|Indonesian National Revolution}}\nWhen [[South-East Asian theatre of World War II|World War II]] broke out, the Dutch initially seemed reluctant to defend their territories in the [[Dutch East Indies|East Indies]].

M. Hassan entitled \"The Singapore heir to the [[Riau Archipelago|Rhio Islands]]\" published in ''[[The Straits Times]]''.]]\nIn the aftermath of the war and the struggle against Dutch rule, several exile associations collectively known as the ''Gerakan Kesultanan Riau'' (Riau Sultanate Movement) emerged in Singapore, planning for a restoration. Some of the groups dated from as early as the dissolution of the sultanate, but started to gain momentum following the post-world war confusion and politics. From the ashes of political uncertainty and fragility in the East Indies following the [[Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies#End of the occupation|World War II]], a [[royalist]] faction known as the Association of the Indigenous Riau Malays ([[Malay language|Malay]]: ''Persatoean Melayu Riouw Sedjati'') (PMRS)  emerged to call for the restoration of the Riau-Lingga Sultanate. The council was financially backed by rich Riau Malay \u00e9migr\u00e9s and Chinese merchants who hoped to obtain tin concession. Initially founded in High Street, Singapore, the association moved to Tanjung Pinang, Riau with the unprecedented approval by the Dutch administrators. Based in Tanjung Pinang, the group managed to gain the consent of the Dutch for [[self-governance]] in the region with the foundation of the Riouw Council ([[Dutch language|Dutch]]: ''Riouw Raad'', [[Malay language|Malay]]: ''Dewan Riouw''). The Riouw Council was the [[devolved]] national [[unicameral]] legislature of Riau, a position equivalent to a [[Parliament]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tanjungpinangpos.co.id/2013/58742/gerakan-sultan-riau-1946-1950-habis/|title=Gerakan Sultan Riau|date=9 February 2013|publisher=Tanjung Pinang Post|location=Tanjung Pinang|language=Indonesian}}</ref>\n\nAfter establishing itself in Tanjung Pinang, the group formed a new organisation known as ''Djawatan Koewasa Pengoeroes Rakjat Riow'' (The Council of Riau People Administration), with the members hailing from [[Tudjuh Archipelago]], [[Great Karimun]], [[Lingga Islands|Lingga]] and [[Singkep]]. This group strongly advocated the restoration of the Riau-Lingga Sultanate after the status of Indonesia became official. The leader of the council, Raja Abdullah, claimed that Riau Malays were neglected at the expense of the non-Riau Indonesians who dominated the upper ranks of the Riau civil administration. By restoring the monarch, they believed the position of Riau Malays would be guarded. The royalist association met with resistance from the [[Republicanism|republican]] group led by Dr. Iljas Datuk Batuah that sent delegates to Singapore to counter the propaganda of sultanate supporters. Based on Indonesian archive records, Dr. Iljas gained approvals from non-Malay newcomers to Riau, including [[Minang people|Minang]], [[Javanese people|Javanese]], [[Palembang]], and [[Batak people]]. He later formed a group known as the ''Badan Kedaulatan Indonesia Riouw'' (BKRI) (Indonesian Riau Sovereign Body) on 8 October 1945. The organisation sought to absorb the Riau Archipelago into the then-[[Indonesian National Revolution|newly independent Indonesia]], as the archipelago was still retained by the Dutch. BKRI hoped that the new administration under [[Soekarno]] would give the [[pribumis]] a fair chance to run the local government.\n\nThe royalist association would not give any public support to the Indonesian movement, as is evident in its refusal to display the ''Bendera Merah-Putih'' ([[Indonesian Flag]]) during the [[Proclamation of Indonesian Independence|Indonesian Independence Day]] celebration on 17 August 1947 in Singapore. This led republicans to call the royalists 'pro-Dutch'. The royalists however, maintained that Riau was a Dutch territory and that only the Dutch could support it. The Dutch countered the claims of the BKRI by granting [[Autonomous administrative division|autonomous rule]] to the Riau Council, in which links with the Dutch would be maintained while a restored sultanate would play a secondary role. The Council, created following the decree of the Governor General of the East Indies on 12 July 1947, was inaugurated on 4 August 1947, and represented a major step forward in the revival of the monarchy system. Several key members of the PMRS were elected to the Riau Council alongside their BKRI rivals, the [[Kapitan Cina|Chinese kapitans]] from Tanjung Pinang and Pulau Tujuh, local Malay leaders of Lingga and Dutch Officials in Tanjung Pinang. On 23 January 1948, the states of the Bangka Council, the Belitung Council, and the Riau Council merged to form the ''Bangka Belitung and Riau Federation''.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=f3iIDAAAQBAJ&pg=PT85&lpg=PT85&dq=federasi+bangka+belitung+dan+riau#v=onepage&q=federasi%20bangka%20belitung%20dan%20riau&f=false|title=Antara Daerah dan Negara: Indonesia Tahun 1950-an|last=Bemmelen|first=Sita van|last2=Raben|first2=Remco|date=2011|publisher=Yayasan Pustaka Obor Indonesia|isbn=9789794617724|language=id}}</ref>\n\nThe call for revival of the sultanate continued throughout the period of autonomous rule under the Riau Council, although the influence of republicanism also continued to strengthen. The appeal of revival began to subside following the dissolution of the ''Bangka Belitung and Riau Federation'' on 4 April 1950. After the official withdrawal by the Dutch in 1950, the Riau Archipelago became ''Keresidenan Riau'' under [[Sumatra|Central Sumatra Province]] following the absorption by the [[United States of Indonesia]]. Being one of the last territories merged into Indonesia, Riau was known as the ''daerah-daerah pulihan'' (recovered regions), and the Riau area became a province in August 1957.\n\nThe leader of Riau forces, Major Raja Muhammad Yunus, who led the bid to reestablish the sultanate apart from Indonesia fled into exile in Johor after his ill attempt.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ck13DAAAQBAJ&pg=PA250&lpg=PA250&dq=Raja+Muhammad+Yunus+riau#v=onepage&q=Raja%20Muhammad%20Yunus%20riau&f=false|title=The SIJORI Cross-Border Region: Transnational Politics, Economics, and Culture|last=Hutchinson|first=Francis E.|last2=Chong|first2=Terence|date=2016-06-14|publisher=ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute|isbn=9789814695589|language=en}}</ref> The [[Geopolitical|geopolitical roots]] of the Riau Archipelago had molded her nationalist position to be sandwiched between the kindred [[Monarchism|monarchist]] Peninsular [[Ethnic Malays#Malay nationalism|Malay Nationalism]] observed across the border in [[British Malaya]] with the [[Republicanism|pro-republic]] and pan-ethnic [[Indonesian National Awakening|Indonesian Nationalism]] manifested in her own [[Dutch East Indies]] domain.\n\n=== Contemporary era ===\n{{Main|Indonesia\u2013Malaysia confrontation}}\nAfter the war, from 1950 the Riau archipelago was a duty-free zone till the [[Indonesia\u2013Malaysia confrontation|Indonesia-Malaysia confrontation]] in 1963.

With [[Batam]] island receiving most of the industrial investments and dramatically developing into a regional industrial centre, it attracted hundreds of thousands of non-Malay Indonesian migrants, changing forever the demographic balance in the archipelago.

The sultan's royal palace was located in [[Penyengat Island|Penyengat Inderasakti]], while the ''Yang Dipertuan Muda'' resided in [[Daik]], Lingga. After becoming a Dutch protectorate, a Dutch resident was installed as an adviser to the sultan. For the hereditary position of the Sultan, the sultan was fully subjected under the influence of the [[Dutch East Indies]] authority.

The province shares maritime border with [[Vietnam]] and [[Cambodia]] to the north, the province of [[Bangka Belitung Islands]] and [[Jambi]] in the south, [[East Malaysia]], [[Brunei]] and the province of [[West Kalimantan]] in the east and [[Peninsular Malaysia]], [[Singapore]] and mainland [[Riau]] in the west.\n\nThe island of [[Batam]], which lies within the central core group of islands (the Riau Archipelago), contains a majority of the province's population. Since becoming part of an economic zone with Singapore in 2006, it has experienced high population growth rates. Other highly populated islands in the Riau Archipelago include [[Bintan Island|Bintan]] and [[Great Karimun|Karimun]], while the archipelago also includes islands such as [[Bulan Island|Bulan]] and [[Kundur Island|Kundur]]. There are around 3,200 islands in the province, which has its capital at [[Tanjung Pinang]] in the south of Bintan Island. The Riau Islands province includes the [[Lingga Islands]] to the south of the main [[Riau Archipelago]], while to the northeast lies the [[Tudjuh Archipelago]], between [[Borneo]] and mainland [[Malaysia]]; the Tudjuh Archipelago consists of four distinct groups \u2014 the [[Anambas Islands]], [[Natuna Islands]], [[Tambelan Archipelago|Tambelan]] islands and [[Badas Islands]] \u2014 which were attached to the new province, though not geographically part of the Riau Archipelago.

It is depends on the different between seawater level in northern part of [[Andaman Sea]] and southern part of Malacca Strait. Since seawater level in [[Pacific Ocean]] is always higher than in [[Indian Ocean|Indian Oceans]], the seawater level in [[South China Sea]] is also higher than in Andaman Sea through out the year resulted in Malacca Strait there is a current, which flow to Northwest direction through out the year. In November to April, during the Northeast monsoon, Andaman Sea\u2019s current goes to the north. Therefore majority of water masses are transported to the north. Consequent of this, during these months, Andaman Sea\u2019s water masses will be empty, and sea water level will be low or the different from South China Sea\u2019s sea water level will be higher. This sea water level reaches to maximum in February to March, while the different of sea water level between Northern and southern parts of Strait is about 50 cm, which resulted current velocity is about 12 cm/sec to Northwest.<ref name=\":8\" /> \n\nConversely, during the southwest monsoon, May to October, most of the currents in western part of [[Andaman Sea]] go to east and south, therefore water masses will be gathering in Andaman Sea. This resulted in that sea water level increases in northern part of [[Strait of Malacca|Malacca Strait]], and the different of sea water level to [[South China Sea]]\u2019s water level will be small, although in southern part of the Strait the sea water level is still higher. During this season, the water current in Malacca Strait flows to the north, with speed is little bit lower. Current velocity reaches to maximum in around [[July]] to [[August]], with speed about 5 cm/sec. Oceanographic pattern is likely to affect the water quality and reef corals in the study sites. Strong wind during the wet monsoon period, for example, could cause water turbulence which affecting on high sediment, especially in coastal areas, and this might be worse with the high sediment run off from surrounding rivers and/or reclamation areas, such as happened in [[Batam]].

However, the strategic geographical location will not provide benefits if the Riau Islands do not have competitiveness. This is because skilled workers and investors are more interested in areas that have competitiveness than regions that are not competitive. Therefore, increasing competitiveness is a necessity to attract investors, both foreign and domestic, to invest in the economic development of the Riau Islands.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=http://setnas-asean.id/site/uploads/document/journals/file/59b0f338090d8-17-cluster-ekonomi-stisipol-raja-haji.pdf|title=Riau Islands in facing the ASEAN economic community|last=Karim|first=Zamzami A.|last2=Rianto|first2=Faizal|date=|website=|publisher=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=17 October 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe economic growth rate of Riau Islands Province in 2005 was 6.57%.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite web|url=https://barenlitbangkepri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Kajian_dan_Analisis_SDM-2005-2013.pdf|title=Kajian dan Analisis Sumber Daya Manusia (Tinjauan IPM) Provinsi Kepulauan Riau Tahun 2005-2013|last=|first=|authorlink=|date=1 September 2014|website=|publisher=[[Statistics Indonesia]]|location=[[Tanjungpinang]]|language=Indonesian|trans-title=Study and Analysis of Human Resources (HDI review) in the Riau Islands 2005-2013|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=17 October 2019}}</ref> Sectors that grew well (faster than the total [[Gross regional domestic product|GRDP]] growth) in 2005 included the transportation and communication sector (8.51%), the manufacturing sector (7.41%), the financial sector, leasing, and corporate services (6.89%), the service sector (6.77%), and the trade, hotel and restaurant sector (6.69%). GRDP Per capita of the Riau Islands in the last five years (2001-2005) tends to increase. In 2001 the GRDP per capita (above the prevailing price - without oil and gas) was Rp. 22,808 million, and in 2005 it increased to Rp.29,348 million.

The manufacturing sector contributes more than 35% and the processing industry accounts for 15.26% of the economy in Riau Islands with oil and gas commodities. In addition to the mining sector, community economic activities are dominant in the agriculture, plantation and forestry sectors. Riau Islands economic growth continued to decline in the period 2011-2014, then increased in 2014. During the period 2011-2014, the economic performance of the Riau Islands had an average growth rate of 6.31%.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nIn 2017, the manufacturing sector formed the largest GDP per share in the province, forming around 36.8% of the total GDP per share of the province.<ref name=\"GDP by province 2017\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.bps.go.id/publication/download.html?nrbvfeve=YzM5NjA5ZDdlYmU4NWI3OGM1N2E4NWE2&xzmn=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYnBzLmdvLmlkL3B1YmxpY2F0aW9uLzIwMTgvMDcvMjcvYzM5NjA5ZDdlYmU4NWI3OGM1N2E4NWE2L3Byb2R1ay1kb21lc3Rpay1yZWdpb25hbC1icnV0by1wcm92aW5zaS1wcm92aW5zaS1kaS1pbmRvbmVzaWEtbWVudXJ1dC1sYXBhbmdhbi11c2FoYS0yMDEzLTIwMTcuaHRtbA%3D%3D&twoadfnoarfeauf=MjAxOS0xMC0xNyAxNTo0Mjo1MA%3D%3D|title=Gross Regional Domestic Product of Indonesia by Industry|author=Statistics Indonesia|date=27 July 2018|website=|publisher=|url-status=live|archive-url=|access-date=17 October 2019|author-link=Statistics Indonesia}}</ref> Based on the main commodities, [[Fossil fuel|mineral fuels]], machinery and electrical equipment remain the mainstay trade of the Riau Islands. This type of commodity has not changed significantly compared to previous years. This needs to be considered given the expansion of the market must also be accompanied by an expansion of commodities both in quality and type.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\nThe second largest sector is the [[Construction|construction industry]], forming around 18% of the total GDP sector.<ref name=\"GDP by province 2017\" /> The development of the number of construction businesses in the Riau Islands fluctuated considerably during the period 2008-2010. In 2010 the number of construction companies in the province was 1,570, with the value of construction completed (revenue) of Rp 5,483 billion. Number of National Labor Force Survey Results show that the number of residents working in the construction sector has fluctuated from time to time. As many as 43,232 people were recorded in February 2009, then decreased in February 2010 to 29,932 people, again increased in August 2010 to 50,833 people, then decreased in February 2011 to 58,211 and again increased in August 2011 to 59,755 people. Because the Riau Islands is a new developing province and almost half of the existing human resources come from outside the Riau Islands, this has caused housing needs in the Riau Islands to be out of proportion to their availability. This condition also seems to have caused housing costs to rise in the Riau Islands relatively faster than in other regions. The results of the National Socio-Economic Survey show that on average the expenditure per capita of the population for rental costs/housing contracts is the highest type of expenditure for non-food commodities, and the figure tends to increase every year. This fact is in line with the increasing frequency of commodity rental prices in the Riau Islands.<ref name=\":6\" />\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Indamming van de groeve Sultan Singkep Tin Maatschappij Riouw TMnr 10007347.jpg|left|thumb|Tin mining in [[Singkep]], Lingga Islands]]\nThe third largest sector is the [[mining]] industry.<ref name=\"GDP by province 2017\" /> Riau Islands is the largest [[bauxite]] producing region in Indonesia. This can be seen from the number of bauxite mining companies. Since 2008, the number of bauxite mining companies has always been the highest compared to other mining companies, although the number has always dropped from 2008-2010. In 2009 the number of bauxite companies fell by 37 companies to 32 in 2010. This decline also had an impact on the decline in the number of workers and output produced by this sector. The [[tin]] company is the second largest company in the Riau Islands after bauxite. Tin companies also have the same situation as bauxite companies that are experiencing a decline. The tin company which initially had 25 companies in 2009 decreased to 22 companies in 2010.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\nA small but significant sector in the province is the agriculture sector, forming around 3.5% of the total GDP sector.<ref name=\"GDP by province 2017\" /> Despite having limited agricultural land, and production of food crops (mainly [[rice]]), the Riau Islands have not been able to meet the needs food for its population. This problem is caused by rice productivity that is still low. [[Cassava]] plants have the highest productivity, then [[sweet potato]] and rice plants are ranked third. In 2011, rice productivity in the Riau Islands reached 3.16 tons per hectare, far below the productivity of cassava and sweet potatoes, which amounted to 10.83 tons per hectare and 7.75 tons per hectare, respectively. When viewed from the harvested area and rice production in 2011, it experienced a very small increase as well as productivity. Rice productivity in 2010 was 3.15 tons per hectare, cassava was 10.82 tons per hectare and sweet potatoes was 7.72 tons per hectare. The increase in productivity of rice and cassava was only 0.01 tons per hectare and sweet potatoes was 0.03 tons per hectare. [[Maize|Corn]] and [[peanut]] crops are food crops in Riau Islands with low productivity during 2010-2011. Whereas for corn productivity in 2010 amounted to 2.13 tons per hectare decreased to 2.12 tons per hectare in 2011. While for peanuts the productivity remained, at 0.92 tons per hectare. Decrease in corn productivity is due to the harvested area for maize also has decreased, besides it is also the effect of pests that cause disruption of corn pests.<ref name=\":6\" /> Plantation and horticultural crops are types of plants that are quite potential to be cultivated in Riau Islands. This is based on the high price of agricultural products produced by these two types of businesses. As shown by the NTP (Farmer Exchange Rate) data, only estate and horticultural farmers have almost certainly an index value above 100. This condition is of course caused by the still higher price of goods produced by farmers compared to the price of goods needed, both for consumption and the cost of production. Production of [[Natural rubber|rubber]] plants in 2011 experienced a very high increase of 118 percent. While [[coconut]] plants experienced a very small increase of 2.4 percent. As for fruit production, in 2011, only [[jackfruit]] and [[banana]] increased, where [[jackfruit]] production increased by 5 percent and banana production increased by 50 percent, compared to production in 2010.

The capital of the Riau Islands, [[Tanjung Pinang]], is one of the city that has the largest percentage of ethnic Chinese population among other cities in Indonesia, amounting to 58.86% of the total population. Until now the majority of Tanjung Pinang's economy is driven by the ethnic Chinese community. They not only controlled the small or medium-scale economy, but also developed into large-scale businesses such as shipbuilding, housing, restaurants and hospitality. In addition to moving in the economy, there are some who become politicians, people's representatives, political figures and even civil servants.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kebudayaan.kemdikbud.go.id/bpnbkepri/menelusuri-jejak-etnis-tionghoa-di-tanjungpinang/|title=Menelusuri Jejak Etnis Tionghoa di Tanjungpinang|last=dediarman|date=2019-02-06|website=Balai Pelestarian Nilai Budaya Kepulauan Riau|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-14}}</ref> Most of the Chinese in Tanjung Pinang, as well as the Riau Islands in a whole trace their ancestors from [[Fujian]], hence most of them are of [[Hoklo people|Hokkien]] origin, while significant population of [[Teochew people|Teochew]] and [[Cantonese people|Cantonese]] origins also exist in the Riau Islands.\n\n=== Language ===\n[[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] is the official language of the state, as well as the province.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_protect/---protrav/---ilo_aids/documents/legaldocument/wcms_174556.pdf|title=The 1945 Constitution of the Republic of Indonesia, as amended by the First Amendment of 1999, the Second Amendment of 2000, the Third Amendment of 2001 and the Fourth Amendment of 2002.|last=|first=|date=18 August 1945|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> However, several [[varieties of Malay]] are spoken in the province.

It served as the ''[[lingua franca]]'' of the province.\n\nThe [[Karimun Regency]] has several dialects namely the Kundur dialect and the Bintan-Karimun dialect. In general, it uses the Johor-Riau dialect. The main characteristic of this dialect is the suffix \"A\" which sounds as \"E\". The word /saya/ and /apa/ (\"I\" and \"What\" respectively) will be pronounced as /saye/ and /ape/ in the Johor-Riau dialect, which is similar to the Malay used in [[Peninsular Malaysia]]. The dialects used in the [[Bintan Regency]] are the Bintan-Karimun dialect, the Malang Rapat-Kelong dialect which is used in Malang Rapat village and Kelong village and the Mantang Lama dialect in Mantang Lama Village in Kijang. The word pronunciation is similar to the Malay used in Tanjung Pinang and Karimun. The Malay used in the [[Lingga Regency]] is also similar to the Malay used in the Karimun and BIitan Regency. The variety of Malay spoken in the province's northernmost regencies, [[Anambas Islands Regency|Anambas]] and [[Natuna Regency|Natuna]], is not only mutually unintelligible to the standard Indonesian language, but also mutually unintelligible to the Malay varieties spoken in Bintan and Karimun. The Anambas Malay dialect slightly resembles the [[Pontianak Malay]] dialect spoken in [[West Kalimantan]] and the Belitung Malay dialect spoken in [[Bangka Belitung Islands|Bangka-Belitung]], especially their vocabulary and phonology. For example, ''kitak'' or ''ketak'' which means you, ''wan'' which means grandma and ''suduk'' which means spoon are both used in Anambas and Pontianak. The Natuna Malay people spoke a dialect of Malay that is influenced by [[Terengganu Malay]] and [[Pahang Malay]] that are spoken in the Malaysian states of [[Terengganu]] and [[Pahang]] respectively, as most of the people living there trace their origins from the eastern coast of the [[Malay Peninsula]]. Historically, the Anambas and Natuna Malays spoke the [[Terengganu Malay]], but its speakers (mostly elderly) are rapidly diminishing and replaced by the local Malay dialects on the islands.<ref>[http://www.mstar.com.my/lain-lain/rencana/2013/12/07/kepulauan-natuna-bergeografikan-malaysia-berdaulatkan-indonesia/ The Natuna Islands: Geographically Malaysian, politically Indonesian], mstar.com.my. 7 December 2013 (in Malay)</ref> The ''[[Orang Laut|Orang laut]]'' people also spoke their own variety of Malay which is still related to the Malay spoken in the Batam-Bintan area.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.genpi.co/hits-style/7443/kepulauan-riau-beda-tempat-lain-dialek-melayunya|title=GenPI.co|website=GenPI.co|language=id|access-date=2019-08-14}}</ref>\n\nTraditionally, the Malay language is written in [[Jawi script]] (locally known in Indonesia as \"Arab-Melayu\"), an Arabic-based writing.<ref>{{cite book|title=How complex are isolating languages?|last=Gil|first=David|publisher=Benjamins|year=2008|editor1-last=Miestamo|editor1-first=Matti|series=Language complexity: Typology, contact, change (Studies in Language Companion Series 94)|location=Amsterdam|pages=109\u2013131|editor2-last=Sinnem\u00e4ki|editor2-first=Kaius|editor3-last=Karlsson|editor3-first=Fred}}</ref> However, the use of Jawi is diminishing rapidly, being replaced by the [[Latin script]] introduced by the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] during the [[Dutch East Indies|colonial era]].

The Riau Islands Hokkien is related  to the Hokkien spoken in mainland Riau, such as the town of [[Bagansiapiapi]] and [[Selat Panjang]], as well as the Hokkien spoken in Central and Southern [[Peninsular Malaysia]] and [[Singapore]]. Together, they are known as the [[Southern Malaysia Hokkien]]. This dialect is based on the [[Quanzhou dialect]], which originated from the city of [[Quanzhou]] in [[Fujian]], [[China]]. It is markedly distinct from [[Penang Hokkien]] and [[Medan Hokkien]], which are based on [[Zhangzhou dialect]], another Hokkien dialect originated from the city of [[Zhangzhou]], also in Fujian. Other varieties of Chinese are also spoken in the province, such as [[Teochew dialect|Teochew]], [[Hainanese]], [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]] and [[Cantonese]], albeit to a lesser extent compared to Hokkien. Hokkien serves as the ''lingua franca'' of the Chinese people in the Riau Islands. Most of the Chinese varieties spoken in the region has been greatly influenced by [[Malay language|Malay]] and [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]], especially their vocabulary.\n\nOther ethnic groups who migrated from other parts of Indonesia brought their own language, such as the [[Javanese language]] spoken by the [[Javanese people|Javanese]], [[Minangkabau language]] spoken by the [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]] and different varieties of [[Batak languages|Batak]] spoken by different sub-groups of the [[Batak]] people.\n\n[[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] is widely used as the national language. Most formal [[education]], and nearly all national [[mass media]], [[governance]], [[Public administration|administration]], [[judiciary]], and other forms of communication in the Riau Islands, are conducted in Indonesian. It is also used for inter-ethnic communication. Indonesian is spoken as the first language in major cities such as [[Batam]] and [[Tanjung Pinang]], while it is spoken as a second language elsewhere in the province. The [[Chinese Indonesians|Chinese people]] in the Riau Islands uses Indonesian as their third language, with Hokkien or other [[Varieties of Chinese|Chinese varieties]] being used as their first language and the local Riau Malay as their second language.\n\n=== Religion ===\n{{bar box|width=250px|barwidth=100px|title=Religion in the Riau Islands (2016)<ref name=\"Kemenag2016\">{{cite web| title = Riau Islands Religion Profile in 2016 | work =  [[Ministry of Religious Affairs (Indonesia)|Indonesian Ministry of Religious Affairs]] | year = 2016 |url = https://kepri.kemenag.go.id/public/files/040920170319221988430497.pdf}}</ref>|titlebar=#ddd|left1=Religion|right1=Percent|float=right|bars=\n{{bar percent|[[Islam]]|Green|77.56}}\n{{bar percent|[[Christianity]]|Violet|14.67}}\n{{bar percent|[[Buddhism]]|Yellow|7.55}}\n{{bar percent|[[Confucianism]]|Black|0.17}}\n{{bar percent|[[Hinduism]]|Magenta|0.05}}}}The local Malay people of the Riau region since ancient times and even until the present-day is considered as a society that is accommodating, friendly, and welcome to immigrants who come to bring new cultures and religions, both from within and outside the country. The example are immigrants from [[India]] with [[Hinduism]], from [[China]] with [[Buddhism]] and [[Confucianism]], from [[Europe]] with [[Christianity]] and [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]], as well as other migrants from various ethnic groups in the [[Nusantara]] archipelago.  Based on the composition of the population of the Riau Islands which is full of diversity with different socio-cultural, linguistic and religious backgrounds, it is basically an asset for the Riau Archipelago itself. The religions embraced by the inhabitants of the province are very diverse, including [[Islam]], [[Protestantism]], [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]], [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], and [[Confucianism]].\n\nAs of 2016, [[Islam]] is the dominant religion in the province, forming 77.56% of the total population. [[Islam]] is generally adhered by the ethnic [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malays]], [[Javanese people|Javanese]], [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]], [[Banjar people|Banjars]], [[Bugis]], [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] and some [[Batak]] sub-group. Islam has entered the region since at least the [[12th century]]. Contact between the indigenous population and Muslim traders from the [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabian peninsula]], [[Iran|Persia]] and India did occur for the first time in the northern Sumatra region because of its strategic position to traders stopover at that time. This condition strengthens the indication that the [[Islamization]] process is expected to have taken place since the contact took place so that a community was formed where the Arabs who settled in the village were married to local residents thus forming Muslim communities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://media.neliti.com/media/publications/164474-ID-islamisasi-di-riau-kajian-sejarah-dan-bu.pdf|title=Islamization in Riau: Historical and Cultural Study of the entry and the development of Islam in Kuntu Kampar|last=Roza|first=Ellya|last2=Yasnel|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=1 October 2019}}</ref> [[Islam]] is generally adhered by the ethnic [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malays]], [[Javanese people|Javanese]], [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]], [[Banjar people|Banjars]], [[Bugis]], [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] and some [[Batak]] sub-group. Several Muslim organizations in Indonesia has branches in the Riau Islands, such as [[Muhammadiyah]] and the [[Nahdlatul Ulama]].\n\n[[Christianity]] forms the second-largest religion group in the province, forming around 14.67% of the total population. The two largest Christian domination in the Riau Islands are [[Protestantism]] and [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]], forming around 12.21% and 2.46% of the total population respectively. Most of the people who adhered Protestantism are from [[Batak]] sub-groups (specifically [[Toba Batak people|Batak Toba]], [[Karo people (Indonesia)|Karo]] and [[Simalungun people|Simalungun]]), [[Nias people|Nias]], [[Chinese Indonesians|Chinese]], and immigrants from [[North Sulawesi]], [[Maluku Islands|Maluku]] and [[Western New Guinea|Papua]], while most of the people who adhered Catholicism are immigrants from [[East Nusa Tenggara]]. The province does not has its own Catholic [[Diocese]]. Instead, it is served by the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Pangkal-Pinang]], which is based in [[Pangkal Pinang|Pangkal-Pinang]], [[Bangka Belitung Islands]].\n\n[[Buddhism]] and [[Confucianism]] forms a significant minority in the province, forming around 7.55% and 0.17% respectively. They are mostly adhered by the Chinese. Lastly, [[Hinduism]] only forms around 0.05% of the total population, which is mostly adhered by [[Balinese people|Balinese]] immigrants and [[Indian Indonesians|Indonesians of Indian descent]].\n\n== Culture ==\nThe culture of the Riau Islands is strongly influenced by the culture of the [[Malay culture|Malays]] and the Chinese people. Some ethnic groups, for example Javanese, Balinese, Bugis, Batak, and European culture also influenced the culture of the province. The culture of the Riau Islands is also influenced by the [[Islamic culture|culture of Islam]]. The Malay people that inhabits Riau Islands is also overwhelmingly adhered to Islam. In addition to Islam, the culture of the Riau Islands has also been influenced by the other religions, such as [[Buddhism]], [[Christianity]] and [[Confucianism]]. However, as the Riau Islands is considered as the home of the Malay people and part of the [[Malay world]], the culture of the Riau Islands mostly relate to the culture of the Malay people themselves.\n\nWhat is typical of the Malay people is the designation of a nickname for a specific person in a family. The first child in a Malay family is called ''long'' or ''sulung'', the second child is called ''ngah''/''ongah'', the third child is called ''cik'' and the youngest child is called ''cu/ucu''. The nickname is usually followed by a word that describes the physical characteristics of the person concerned, for example ''cik'' ''itam,'' which means a third child with a dark/black characteristic. This culture can only be found in the Riau Malay community, both in the Riau Islands as well as mainland Riau.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ilmuseni.com/seni-budaya/kebudayaan-suku-melayu|title=Kebudayaan Suku Melayu yang Paling Fenomenal|last=Antono|first=Agil|date=2017-12-28|website=IlmuSeni.com|language=id|access-date=2019-10-02}}</ref>\n\nA typical Riau Malay ''[[Kampong|kampung]]'' (village) are led by a village chief called the ''penghulu''. Presently, the ''penghulu'' is a village administrator chosen based on government regulations. Besides the ''penghulu'' there is also a leader in the religious sector called ''[[imam]]''. This ''imam'' takes care of all matters relating to religion, such as religious studies and lessons, marriage/ divorce/reconciliation, the distribution of inheritance, collection of [[zakat]] and others. Thus the ''penghulu'' accompanied by the ''imam'' are the leader of the ''kampung''.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web |last=Annisa|first=Pahlevi|title=Kebudayaan-melayu-riau |url=https://www.academia.edu/7535760 |website=Academia |language=id}}</ref>\n\nIn the ''kampung'', most of the local people knew each other, because the villagers had a strong sense of attachment to each other. Harmony is a characteristic of the community of these ''kampung''. The existence of harmony is not caused by external coercion in the form of harsh sanctions, but it does arise from a conscience that is influenced by the norms that live in the community. Starting from the movements, attitudes and traits are influenced by these factors. Avoiding things that can cause disgrace and shame is a motivating factor for continuing to act and be kind to others and such feelings are stronger than feelings of sin. All actions must be maintained so as not to cause \"discordant eyes\", \"discordant ears\", \"discordant manners\".<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Arts and Performance===\n[[File:Joget-Dangkong.jpg|thumb|A troupe of local Riau Malay dancers performing the [[Joget|Joget Lambak]]. (taken in the late 19th century)]]\nVarious forms and types of arts found in the Riau region, namely theater, dance, music, singing, and literature. Artists in urban areas generally feel alien to traditional arts. Therefore, an appreciative link is needed by introducing all types and forms of traditional arts in urban areas. Thus, contemporary art that grows, lives, and develops in urban areas will have a solid and tidy foundation in contributing to national art.\n\nIn the late 1890s, the Rusydiah Club was founded, an association for scholars, writers, and cultural figures.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/323835285|title=The Rushdiah Club: Its roles in Malay Societies, 1892-1940|last=Zakariya|first=Hafiz|last2=Oktasari|first2=Wiwin|date=2017-12-29|isbn=9789674186319}}</ref> This association was established in the Riau Islands, precisely on [[Penyengat Island]] which at that time was the center of the government of the [[Riau-Lingga Sultanate|Sultanate of Riau-Lingga]]. In essence, this association is a cultural institution that includes art, performance and literature. Its activities began with the commemoration of Islamic holidays, such as [[Mawlid|Maulud Nabi]], [[Isra and Mi'raj|Isra-Mikraj]], [[History of the Quran|Nuzulul Quran]], [[Eid al-Fitr|Eid al-Fit]]<nowiki/>r, [[Eid al-Adha]], and others which later developed to the publication of books by members of the association. All activities are supported by royal facilities in the form of the Marah Ahmadi Khanah Polar library and two [[Jawi alphabet|Jawi]] printing presses, namely Mathba\u2018at al Ahmadiyah and Mathba\u2018at al Riauwiyah.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kebudayaan.kemdikbud.go.id/bpnbkepri/makam-merah-dan-alias-wello/|title=Makam Merah dan Alias Wello|last=dediarman|date=2016-12-29|website=Balai Pelestarian Nilai Budaya Kepulauan Riau|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-02}}</ref> The Rusydiah Klub is the first association of scholars in Indonesia. This association is not mentioned in national history, because of the lack of careful collection of historical material, or maybe because there is no input from those who know much about it. Rusydiah Club left behind a valuable heritage of creativity in the form of books of literature, religion, history and linguistics.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nThe Riau region has long been an area of trade traffic in neighboring countries, so Riau has given birth to diverse cultural figures and colors. This is a burden, as well as a historical-geographical blessing. Riau seems to be a field of association of various artistic potentials, in which there are cultural influences in neighboring countries and other Indonesian cultures. Riau Malay art is very diverse, because small groups that exist in the community are also developing.<ref name=\":2\" /> The fact shows, the arts in Riau and the arts in Malay countries such as [[Malaysia]], [[Singapore]] and [[Brunei|Brunei Darussalam]] mutually complement and influence each other. Likewise, Malay cultural regions such as [[Sultanate of Deli|Deli]], [[Sultanate of Langkat|Langkat]], [[Serdang Malays|Serdang]] and [[Asahan Sultanate|Asahan]] in [[North Sumatra]], [[Jambi]], [[West Kalimantan]], and others, were also affected by the [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]], [[Mandailing people|Mandailing]], [[Buginese people|Bugis]] and [[Javanese people|Javanese]] cultures. Cultures influence that come from outside Indonesia such as [[India]] ([[Hindus|Hindu]]-[[Buddhism|Buddhist]]), [[Arabs|Arabic]] ([[Islam]]), [[Chinese culture|Chinese]], and [[Thai culture|Siamese]] influence. The flexibility of Malay culture is in line with the historical development and geographical location of Riau, making Riau very rich with a variety of artistic expressions. The development of Malay culture in Riau, in turn, can enrich national culture.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n''[[Baju Kurung|Baju kurung]]'' is one of the traditional clothes of the Malay community in [[Brunei]], [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], [[Singapore]], and [[southern Thailand]]. ''[[Baju Kurung|Baju kurung]]'' is often associated with women. The hallmark of the clothes brackets is the loose design on the holes in the arms, abdomen, and chest. When worn, the bottom of the clothes bracket is parallel to the groin, but for rare cases there are also those that extend to knee level. Shirt brackets are not fitted with buttons, but are almost similar to t-shirts. Shirt brackets are also not collared, each end is crochet. Some parts are often decorated with gold embroidery. At first, the clothes of the brackets were usually worn for the great ceremony of Malay by women in the kingdom, used together with ''[[songket]]'' cloth to be used as a scabbard, various gold jewelry, and a small bag or fan. Since the majority of Malay communities embraced [[Islam]], many women who wear clothes in brackets match them with the [[hijab]], although there are also those who do not use them. Now the clothes of brackets are widely worn by ordinary people, used by children to read the [[Quran]], or ladies to go to the market, without including accessories that seem luxurious.\n\nHowever, the main traditional dress of the people of the Riau Islands is the ''[[Kebaya]] Labuh'' and the ''Teluk Belanga.''<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.raparapa.co/pakaian-adat/|title=34 Pakaian Adat di Indonesia, Kekayaan yang Masih Dilestarikan|last=Raparapa|date=2017-01-13|website=Raparapa|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-17}}</ref> The ''[[Kebaya]] Labuh a''re specifically worn by women. It is typically worn at the time of traditional ceremonies and official events of the local community. The hallmark of ''Kebaya Labuh'' and ''Teluk Belangga'' traditional clothing is the length of the kebaya to cover the knees with the shape of the kebaya looking wide and open. ''Kebaya Labuh'' is often combined with [[batik]] cloth such as cual fabric. For the wedding, the groom wore a head covering called ''[[Tengkolok|Tanjak]]''. The spindle is a rectangular [[songket]] that is folded into a headband. A distinctive feature of the ''Teluk Belanga'' custom clothing is a plain color paired with shades of color, a sheath worn over the knee that acts as a scarf, a headband made of songket cloth called the ''tanjak''. The custom attire of ''Kebaya Labuh'' and ''Teluk Belangga'' is complemented by a headdress called a peak which is a head covering made of square ''songket'' shaped like songkok or peci.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bp-guide.id/AXOkKPew|title=9+ Ragam Baju Adat Sumatera Yang Keren dan Wajib Kamu Tahu (2018)|website=BP Guide - Temukan hadiah terbaikmu|language=id|access-date=2019-04-18}}</ref> Typically, the skirt is only used for formal ceremonies or events such as feasts and custom ceremonies. However, these decorations are usually only worn on formal occasions such as death or marriage. Occasionally, ''Teluk Belangga'' clothing is usually accompanied by a ''[[Songkok|peci]]''. For women, the ''Kebaya Labuh'' is usually combined with batik and also with a scarf.\n[[File:Raiyani Muharramah-Silat pengantin.jpg|thumb|Malay men performing the ''Silat Pengantin'' traditional dance in a wedding ceremony at [[Lingga Regency|Lingga Islands]]]]\nThe ''[[Mak yong]]'' is one of the traditional dances that can be found in the Riau Islands. ''Mak Yong'' is a traditional theatrical art of the Malay community which is still sustainable today. Although it is not often performed, every service is always welcomed by enthusiastic residents, especially those who love Malay culture and native art. ''Mak Yong'' performances are usually performed by groups of dancers and musicians, who combine various religious elements, theatrical, dance, music, vocals and texts. The main characters are male and female, both are performed by female dancers. The ''Mak yong'' performance is accompanied by musical instruments such as fiddle and drums.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://kepri-travel.kepriprov.go.id/item/makyong/|title=MAKYONG {{!}} Wonderful Kepri - Official Site|language=id-ID|access-date=2019-10-04}}</ref> In the Riau Islands region, the ''Mak Yong'' oral tradition has been exhibited since several centuries ago and has spread to [[Bangka Island|Bangka]], [[Johor]], [[Malacca]] and [[Penang]]. In the Riau Islands, this oral tradition developed rapidly during the sultanate era. ''Mak yong'' theater performing arts is played with dances, songs and jokes that are intertwined in a story line, the players are 20 people, women wearing glittering costumes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kebudayaan.kemdikbud.go.id/ditwdb/makyong-kepulauan-riau-seni-pertujukkan/|title=Makyong Kepulauan Riau, Seni Pertujukkan|last=ditwdb|date=2019-04-30|website=Direktorat Warisan dan Diplomasi Budaya|language=id-ID|access-date=2019-10-04}}</ref>\n\n''[[Zapin]]'' is a Malay traditional dance that can be found in both the Riau Islands and mainland. This dance is one of several types of Malay dance that still exists today. According to history, in the beginning this dance was a dance of entertainment in the palace after being brought from [[Hadhramaut|Hadramaut]] in [[Yemen]] by Arab traders in the early [[16th century|16th century.]] At that time the country of [[Johor]] became a substitute for the role of [[Malacca]] as an international port in the 16th century. This can be seen from the development of ''Zapin'' dance creations that are identical with Malay culture and in terms of rhyming. Artists and culture are able to make traditional art, not stopping but full of dynamics that are always acceptable in every circumstance. This traditional dance is both educational and entertaining, and is used as an Islamic [[Dawah|da'wah]] medium through ''Zapin'' songs that are sung. The accompanying music consists of fiddles, tambourines, drums and small drum percussion instruments called [[Mirwas|marwas]] or maracas. The ''Zapin'' dance focuses more on teamwork rather than individual efforts. Before the 1960s, ''Zapin'' was only performed by male dancers but now it is usually danced by female dancers or both male and female.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kebudayaan.kemdikbud.go.id/bpnbkepri/tari-zapin/|title=Tari Zapin|last=dediarman|date=2014-06-08|website=Balai Pelestarian Nilai Budaya Kepulauan Riau|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-04}}</ref>\n\nThe ''Malemang'' dance is a traditional Riau dance by the people of [[Bintan Island|Bintan]]. It originated back in the [[12th century]] in Tanjungpisau. Originally, it was only performed at the Royal Palace of the Kingdom of Bentan in Bukit Batu, Bintan. As the kingdom collapsed, this dance became a folk entertainment show. At present, ''Malemang'' Dance is displayed in various events, including festivals. In the show, the dancers demonstrate their ability to take something (handkerchief, change, etc.). They do this by flexing (standing up, bending backwards). From this skill then this dance is called ''malemang'' or ''melemang''. In Tanjungpisau, this dance is better known as the ''Melemang Bintan Penaga'' Dance.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://blogkulo.com/daftar-10-tarian-daerah-riau-kepri/|title=Daftar 10 Nama Tarian Daerah Riau & Kepulauan Riau untuk Anda Ketahui|last=Kulo|first=oleh Blog|date=2019-05-25|website=Blog Kulo|language=id-ID|access-date=2019-10-04}}</ref>\n\n===Architecture===\n[[File:TMII Riau Pavilion Malay House 02.jpg|thumb|A typical Malay traditional house in the [[Taman Mini Indonesia Indah]], Jakarta]]\nIn [[Malay culture]], the art of development also has characteristics that are reflected in the symbols of traditional houses that are full of meaning. At present, Malay traditional houses can still be found in several regions in the [[Riau Archipelago]], [[Peninsular Malaysia]], [[Brunei]] and other [[Malay world|Malay-populated countries]]. In traditional Malay society, a house is an intact building that can be used as a family residence, meeting place and shelter for anyone in need. Therefore, traditional Malay houses are generally large, usually with six poles, six porch poles and twelve poles or porch houses. Of the several forms of the house, all are almost identical, both stairs, doors, walls and room layout are identical. In addition to being large, the Malay house is also always in the form of a stage or a house with a hole, facing towards the sunrise. In general, the types of Malay houses include dwellings, halls, houses of worship and storage houses. The naming is adjusted to the function of each building.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gpswisataindonesia.info/2013/12/rumah-adat-riau-dan-kepulauan-riau/|title=Rumah Adat Riau dan Kepulauan Riau|last=admin|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-03}}</ref>\n\nRiau Malay traditional house buildings are generally given a variety of decorations, starting from the door, window, ventilation to the top of the roof of the building, the decoration is adjusted to the meaning of each carving.  Additionally, these houses are also given a pattern. The pattern of a [[Riau Malays|Riau Malay]] house is largely derived from nature, consisting of flora, fauna, and space objects. These things are designed in certain forms, either in their original form such as backdrops, forest flowers, or in abstracted or modified forms so that they no longer appear in their original form, but simply use their name.\n\nThe ''Limas Potong'' house is one of the traditional houses of the Malays inhabiting the [[Riau Archipelago]].<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://situsbudaya.id/rumah-limas-potong-batam/|title=Rumah Limas Potong Batam|date=2017-11-30|website=Informasi Situs Budaya Indonesia|language=id-ID|access-date=2019-10-03}}</ref> ''Limas Potong'' is a stilt house, like a traditional house in [[Sumatra]] in general. Height of about 1.5 meters from the ground surface. The walls of the house are made of brown planks, while the roof is red zinc. The doors, windows and pillars on the front of the house are painted in white oil. ''Limas Potong'' has five main parts, namely terrace, front room, center, back (bed), and kitchen. The front of the house is used to display historical photographs of this traditional house, the living room contains a typical Malay bridal diorama, and the back is a room that contains a mosquito net that integrates with the kitchen.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nOne of the most famous traditional house of the people of the Riau Islands is the ''Belah Bubung'' traditional house. This house is also known as the ''Rabung'' house or the ''Bumbung Melayu'' house. The name ''Belah Bubung'' was given by the Malays because the shape of the roof was split. The size of the house built is determined by the ability of its owner, the richer a person is, the bigger the house and the more variety of decoration. However, wealth is not an absolute determinant. The most important consideration in making a home is harmony with the owner. To determine whether or not a house is compatible, the owner calculates the size of the house by cubits, from one to five. The veins are: snake swimming, pursuing ripples, ripples climbing beetles shelter, debt out of debt changed debt, and five debt has not been affected. The best measure is if it is right on the count of ripples to climb the shade beetle.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n===Traditional weapon===\n''Badik Tumbuk Lado'' is a traditional weapon originating from the Riau Islands. ''[[Badik]]'' itself is a term for traditional weapons which is known among the Bugis community and some regions in [[Sumatra]]. Meanwhile, Tumbuk Lada is a traditional weapon of the [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay people]]. No wonder the ''Badik Tumbuk Lado'' has similarities with weapons from other Malay-populated region. The Riau Islands are inhabited by various races and ethnicity. However, the majority of indigenous people are Malay people. Therefore, the culture of the Riau region has a lot in common with other indigenous Malay regions.  ''Badik Tumbuk Lado'' is a type of stabbing weapon measuring 27 to 29 cm and its width is around 3.5 to 4 cm. This weapon is not only used by the people of [[Jambi]], and also has similarities with the [[Buginese people|Buginese]] ''Badik'', it only differs in the shape and motive of the holster. Not only domestically, Malaysia also has the same traditional weapons, both in name and form. This is inseparable from the background of Malay communities spread throughout [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], the [[Philippines]], [[Vietnam]] and along the Malay peninsula. Similar to the ''[[Kris|keris]]'', ''badik'' is also one of the identities that characterizes the Malay people. Until now the ''Badik Tumbuk Lado'' is still used by the people of the Riau islands to do production work such as farming or hunting. Some local customs also still maintain the ''badik'' as a complement to men's custom clothing.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gpswisataindonesia.info/2014/09/senjata-tradisional-kepulauan-riau/|title=Senjata Tradisional Kepulauan Riau|last=admin|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-04}}</ref>\n\nThe ''Jenawi'' is a type of sword that became the most popular traditional weapon in the Riau area. This sword was often used by Malay warlords in the face of his enemies. The sword has a length of about 1 meter so it is often used for close combat. ''Jenawi'' sword is similar to a typical Japanese [[katana]]. Historians and cultural experts argue that this weapon originated from ancient Japan which experienced acculturation with Malay culture. Regardless of this opinion, the sword of genius remains a Malay people's identity on the national scene.\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n{{Main|Malay cuisine}}\n[[File:Nasi Lemak Sambal Cumi in Indonesia 2.jpg|thumb|[[Nasi lemak|Nasi Lemak]] Sambal Cumi, a variety of Nasi Lemak that can be found in the Riau Islands ]]\nCuisine in the Riau Islands are mostly similar to the one in [[Peninsular Malaysia]], owing to its similar culture.

This piece of fish is smeared with egg whites to remove the fishy smell, then cooked with spices and mixed with starfruit and green tomatoes. Pieces of white or green mustard greens are also incorporated into this soup.\n\nThe [[Bak kut teh]] (\u8089\u9aa8\u8336) is another dish found in the Riau Islands, usually consumed by the Chinese people in the province. the dish can only be found in the region as well as neighboring Singapore and Malaysia. Bak kut teh means meat tea bone. ''Bak kut'' itself is pork ribs, while the word ''teh'', which means tea in [[Hokkien]], comes from either the dish brown sauce which is similar to the color of a tea, or that it was originally served with tea to mollify the taste.. This gravy is a pork broth, with spices such as garlic and strong pepper.\n\nSnacks and drinks such as the [[teh tarik]] and [[curry puff]] can also be found in the province. Teh Tarik is not originally an original beverage from the Riau Islands. This drink is familiar in Southeast Asia especially easily found in [[Malaysia]] and [[Singapore]]. However, in the Riau Islands, such as [[Batam]], [[Tanjung Pinang]] and Tanjung Balai Karimun, this drink is commonly availabe everywhere.The condition of the Riau Islands, which is close to Malaysia and Singapore has made Teh Tarik to spread around the Riau Islands.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kebudayaan.kemdikbud.go.id/bpnbkepri/teh-tarik-ala-kepri/|title=Teh Tarik Ala Kepri|last=dediarman|date=2018-12-20|website=Balai Pelestarian Nilai Budaya Kepulauan Riau|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-21}}</ref> Curry puff, also known as ''epok-epok'' in the local Riau Islands Malay, is a famous local snack that can be commonly found everywhere in the province.
