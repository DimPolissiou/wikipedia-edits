On 11 September 1827 the Irish actress [[Harriet Smithson]] played the part of Ophelia in ''Hamlet''.<ref name=Cairns1969p70>[[#Cairns1969|Cairns, David (1969)]], p. 70.</ref>\n[[File:Harriet Smithson as Ophelia 1827 (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|left|Harriet Smithson as Ophelia (1827)]]\nHer mad scene appeared to owe little to tradition and seemed almost like an improvisation, with several contemporary accounts remarking on her astonishing capacity for mime. Her performances produced an extraordinary reaction: men wept openly in the theater, and when they left were \"convulsed by uncontrollable emotion.\"<ref name=Cairns1969p619>[[#Cairns1969|Cairns, David (1969)]], pp. 619&ndash;620.</ref> The twenty-five-year-old [[Alexandre Dumas, p\u00e8re]], who was about to embark on a major career as a novelist and dramatist, was in the audience and found the performance revelatory, \"far surpassing all my expectations\".<ref name=Cairns1999p247>[[#Cairns1999|Cairns, David (1999)]], p. 247.</ref> The French composer [[Hector Berlioz]] was also present at that opening night performance and later wrote: \"The lightning flash of that sublime discovery opened before me at a stroke the whole heaven of art, illuminating it to its remotest depths. I recognized the meaning of dramatic grandeur, beauty, truth.\"<ref name=Cairns1969p70/> Even the wife of the [[Granville Leveson-Gower, 1st Earl Granville|English ambassador]], Lady Granville, felt compelled to report that the Parisians \"roar over Miss Smithson's Ophelia, and strange to say so did I\".<ref>[[#Cairns1999|Cairns, David (1999)]], p. 248.</ref> (The actress's Irish accent and the lack of power in her voice had hindered her success in London.)<ref name=Cairns1969p619/> It wasn't long before new clothing and hair styles, ''\u00e0 la mode d'Oph\u00e9lie'' and modeled on those of the actress, became all the rage in Paris.<ref name=Fauser/>\n\nNot everything about the performance or the play was considered convincing. The supporting players were conceded to be weak. The large number of corpses on the stage in the final scene was found by many to be laughable. But Hamlet's interaction with the ghost of his father, the play-within-the-play, Hamlet's conflict with his mother, Ophelia's mad scene, and the scene with the gravediggers were all found to be amazing and powerful. The moment in the Play Scene when Claudius rises up and interrupts the proceedings, then rushes from the stage, provoked a long and enthusiastic ovation. The journal ''Pandore'' wrote about \"that English candour which allows everything to be expressed and everything to be depicted, and for which nothing in nature is unworthy of imitation by drama\".<ref name=Cairns1999p247/> Dumas felt the play and the performances provided him \"what I was searching for, what I lacked, what I had to find &ndash; actors forgetting they were on stage [...] actual speech and gesture such as made actors creatures of God, with their own virtues, passions and weaknesses, not wooden, impossible heroes booming sonorous platitudes\".<ref name=Cairns1999p247/>\n\nThe composer Berlioz was soon totally infatuated with Miss Smithson. His love for her, initially unrequited, became an obsession and served as inspiration for his music. His ''[[Symphonie fantastique]]'' (''Fantastic Symphony'', 1830) portrays an opium-induced vision in which the musician's beloved appears as a recurrent musical motif, the ''id\u00e9e fixe'', which like any obsession \"finds its way into every incredible situation [movement]\".<ref>Milder, John (1963).

Besides in music, it also manifested itself in art. [[Auguste Pr\u00e9ault]]'s relief ''Oph\u00e9lie'' (1844) depicted a young woman wading into water with her hair let down and swirling in the current.<ref name=Fauser/>\n\n===French versions of the play===\n[[File:DUMAS PERE.jpg|thumb|Alexandre Dumas, p\u00e8re]]\nBy the early 1840s [[Alexandre Dumas, p\u00e8re|Alexandre Dumas]], who had become a personal friend of Berlioz and Smithson,<ref>[[#Barzun|Barzun, Jacques (1969)]], '''1''': 277, 315.</ref> had achieved international fame with his historical novels and dramas. With the heightened interest in Shakespeare, and in particular ''Hamlet'', that had been aroused by Smithson's performances at the Od\u00e9on, he decided to prepare a new French translation of the play to be presented at his [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Historique]]. An earlier verse translation of ''Hamlet'' into French by [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Ducis]], first performed in 1769, was still being given at the [[Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise]], and Dumas knew the leading role by heart. The Ducis play bore very little resemblance to the Shakespeare original. There were far fewer characters: no ghost, no Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, no players, no gravediggers. There was no duel, and Hamlet did not die at the end. Modifications such as these were necessary to gain performances in the French theaters of his time. Ducis had told the English actor-impresario [[David Garrick]] that a ghost which speaks, itinerant players, and a fencing duel were \"absolutely inadmissible\" on the French stage.<ref>[[#Pemble|Pemble, John (2005)]], p. 97.</ref> Dumas realized that Ducis' play was not the same as the original: Pierre Le Tourneur had published a relatively faithful prose translation, not intended for performance, in 1779. Nevertheless, moral propriety and ''politesse'' dictated that only such highly sanitized versions as that of Ducis could be performed on stage. The French referred to these performing editions as ''imitations'', and most knew that they were highly modified versions of the original. All the same, Ducis was at first accused of polluting French theaters with Shakespeare; only much later was he indicted for mutilating the original.<ref>[[#Pemble|Pemble, John (2005)]], p. 98.</ref>\n\nDumas could not speak or read English well. He needed help, so he selected a younger writer by the name of [[Paul Meurice]] from among his coterie of prot\u00e9g\u00e9s and assistants. Meurice had earlier collaborated with [[Auguste Vacquerie]] on ''Falstaff'', a combination of [[Henry IV, Part 1|Parts I]] and [[Henry IV, Part 2|II of Shakespeare's ''Henry IV'']], which had been presented at the Od\u00e9on in 1842. The Dumas-Meurice ''Hamlet'' was performed at Dumas' Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Historique in 1847 and had an enormous success. (With some alterations the Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise took it into repertory in 1886, and it continued to be performed in France until the middle of the 20th century.)<ref name=Fauser/><ref>[[#Pemble|Pemble, John (2005)]], p. 109.</ref>\n\nThe Dumas-Meurice version was more faithful to Shakespeare and restored much of what was missing from the Ducis version, including Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, the ghost, the duel, and the gravediggers. Still, by modern standards, it was a rather free adaptation of the original. Fortinbras was dropped, and the entire opening scene with the sentinels on the ramparts of the castle was excised. A love scene between Hamlet and Ophelia was added to the first act. Claudius does not send Hamlet to England, so Rosencrantz and Guildenstern do not die. Notably, at the end of the play, as Gertrude, Claudius, and Laertes are dying, the ghost of Hamlet's father reappears and condemns each of the dying characters. To Claudius it says: ''D\u00e9sesp\u00e8re et meurs!'' &ndash; \"Despair and die!\"; to Laertes: ''Prie et meurs!'' &ndash; \"Pray and die!\"; and to the Queen: ''Esp\u00e8re et meure!'' &ndash; \"Hope and die!\". When the wounded Hamlet asks: ''Et quel ch\u00e2timent m'attend donc?'' &ndash; \"And what punishment awaits me?\", the ghost responds: ''Tu vivras!'' &ndash; \"You shall live!\", and the curtain falls.<ref name=Fauser/><ref>[[#Pemble|Pemble, John (2005)]], pp. 109\u2013111.</ref>\n\nDumas explained these \"improvements\" to Shakespeare's play by insisting that the original violated plausibility, transgressed decency, and destroyed the dramatic balance. \"Since Hamlet is not guilty to the same degree as the others, he should not die the same death as the others.\" Four dead bodies would constitute \"the most unpleasant effect.\" Since the ghost appears at the beginning of the play, \"it must necessarily reappear to be present at the end.\"<ref>[[#Pemble|Pemble, John (2005)]], p. 111.</ref>\n\n==Preparation of the libretto==\nThe librettists for the opera of ''Hamlet'', Michel Carr\u00e9 and Jules Barbier, were experienced: they had already provided librettos for Thomas' ''Mignon'' and also for Gounod's ''Faust''.<ref name=Forbes21>[[Elizabeth Forbes (musicologist)|Forbes, Elizabeth]], \"Hamlet\" in [[#HamletCD1993|''Hamlet'' CD Booklet (1993)]], p. 21.</ref> They chose Dumas' version of the play as the basis for their libretto. This was the version with which French audiences of the day were most familiar, and the one against which the opera would be compared and judged.<ref name=Fauser/>\n\nWhen adapting a play for opera, it was imperative to shorten and simplify. Traditionally [[grand opera]] conveys plot in broad brushstrokes; the audience is not particularly interested in its intricacies, or its detours and complexities.<ref>White, Nicholas (2003). \"Fictions and librettos\" in Charlton, David, ed. ''[[Cambridge Companions to Music|The Cambridge Companion to Grand Opera]]'', p. 45. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-521-64683-3}}.</ref> An uncut version of Shakespeare's play had more than 30 characters and could run for over four hours. The libretto reduced the total number of characters to fifteen (counting the four mime players required for the Play scene), and also reduced the number of subplots. Dumas had cut the scene with the sentinels Bernardo and Francisco. Gone also were Voltimand, Cornelius, Osric, and Reynaldo. Like Dumas, Fortinbras was omitted, thus there was no need to mention an invasion from Norway. Dumas omitted the subplot of Hamlet's voyage to England, so Rosencrantz and Guildenstern were also omitted, removing most of the black humor of the play. Polonius' accidental murder in act 4 was excised, and his singing part reduced to only eight measures.<ref name=Fauser/><ref name=Forbes21/><ref name=Salter>Salter, Lionel (1994). [http://www.gramophone.net/Issue/Page/January%201994/99 Review of the recording of ''Hamlet'' with Thomas Hampson]. ''Gramophone'', January 1994.</ref>\n\nThis simplification of characters and subplots focused the drama on Hamlet's predicament and its effects on Oph\u00e9lie and left the opera with essentially 4 main characters: Hamlet and Oph\u00e9lie, Claudius and Gertrude. This constellation of roles preserved the tetradic model and the balance of male and female parts which had become established in French grand opera at the time of Meyerbeer's ''[[Robert le diable]]'' in 1831. The libretto originally specified for these roles one soprano (Oph\u00e9lie), one mezzo-soprano (Gertrude), one tenor (Hamlet), and one baritone or bass (Claudius).<ref name=Fauser/>\n\nOther plot changes, such as making L\u00e4erte less cynical and more positive towards Hamlet early on,<ref name=Gurewitsch/> not only simplified the story but heightened the tragedy of their duel in the Gravediggers Scene. Making Gertrude a co-conspirator alongside Claudius, enhanced the dramatic conflict between Hamlet and Gertrude when Hamlet attempts to coerce a confession from her in the Closet Scene. Making Polonius a co-conspirator, as revealed in the Closet Scene, strengthened Hamlet's motivation in rejecting his marriage to Oph\u00e9lie. This crucial change facilitated the transformation of Shakespeare's Ophelia into the opera's Oph\u00e9lie, a creature who dramatically is almost entirely drawn from the 19th-century, whose madness stems not from the actions of a man who creates an intolerable situation, but rather from a man whose withdrawal leaves an emptiness she is unable to fill. Musically, of course, the Mad Scene was one of those audience-pleasing creations which drew upon well-established operatic tradition.<ref name=Fauser/><ref name=Forbes24>Forbes, Elizabeth, \"Hamlet\" in [[#HamletCD1993|''Hamlet'' CD Booklet (1993)]], p. 24.</ref>\n\nAnother change, the addition of Hamlet's drinking song for the Players in act 2, created another opportunity for an audience-pleasing musical number. It also led to a shortening of his instructions to them before the song<ref name=Forbes21/> and could be justified dramatically as a cover for his ulterior motive in asking them to enact the mime play.<ref name=Tubeuf/> In the final scene, in another simplification of the plot, La\u00ebrte, Polonius, and Gertrude survive. As in the Dumas' play, the ghost returns at the end, but unlike in Dumas, the ghost merely banishes Gertrude to a convent for her role in the conspiracy. Finally, exactly as in Dumas, Hamlet lives and is proclaimed King.<ref name=Tubeuf>[[Andr\u00e9 Tubeuf|Tubeuf, Andr\u00e9]]; Corbier, Annie, trans. \"Synopsis\" in [[#HamletCD1993|''Hamlet'' CD Booklet (1993)]], pp. 30&ndash;32.</ref>\n\n==Composition==\n[[File:Hamlet (opera) by Thomas, Cover of Piano-Vocal Score.jpg|thumb|Cover of the piano-vocal score of Thomas' ''Hamlet'' (1868)]]\nVery little is known concerning the details of the composition of the music. Thomas may have received the libretto around 1859. The original libretto was in four acts, but the requirements of the authorities at that time specified the premiere at the [[Paris Op\u00e9ra]] of at least one 5-act opera per season.<ref name=Fauser/> The inclusion of a ballet was also obligatory.<ref name=Forbes611/> The fourth and final act, which included the Mad Scene and the Gravediggers Scene, was simply split into two. To confer more weight to the new fourth act, the ballet was added between the choral introduction of the Mad Scene and Oph\u00e9lie's recitative and aria.<ref name=Fauser/>\n\nIn 1863 the director of the Op\u00e9ra, [[\u00c9mile Perrin]], wrote in a letter to a minister of state that Thomas had nearly finished writing the music. Later the press conjectured as to the reason for the delay of the opera, suggesting that Thomas had yet to find his ideal Oph\u00e9lie.<ref name=Fauser/> Thomas' opera ''[[Mignon]]'' (1866), an adaptation of Goethe's novel ''[[Wilhelm Meisters Lehrjahre]]'', had been the composer's very effective response to Gounod's earlier Goethe adaption, the opera [[Faust (opera)|''Faust'']], which had premiered in 1859. ''Mignon'' had been performed at the [[Op\u00e9ra-Comique]], and Thomas was under pressure to provide a similar success at the Op\u00e9ra, in particular as several of his earlier productions there had done poorly.<ref name=Forbes726>[[Elizabeth Forbes (musicologist)|Forbes, Elizabeth]], \"Thomas, (Charles Louis) Ambroise\" in [[#NewGroveOpera|Sadie (1992)]] '''4''': 726-727.</ref>\n\nWhen Gounod's Shakespeare adaptation, the opera ''[[Rom\u00e9o et Juliette]]'', appeared at the [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Lyrique]] in 1867, it provided additional impetus for Thomas to finish working on his own adaptation of ''Hamlet''.<ref>Forbes, Elizabeth, \"Hamlet\" in [[#HamletCD1993|''Hamlet'' CD Booklet (1993)]], pp. 20&ndash;21.</ref> According to accounts in the press, it was that same year, at his publisher [[Heugel (music publisher)|Heugel]]'s office in Paris, that Thomas met the Swedish soprano [[Christine Nilsson]], who had just been engaged at the Op\u00e9ra. Thomas finally consented to the scheduling of the premiere. Consistent with this press report, parts of the soprano role were altered around this time with Nilsson's capabilities in mind. Thomas replaced a dialog with the women's chorus in the Mad Scene in act 4 with a Swedish Ballade.<ref name=Fauser/> The ballad is [[Neck_(water_spirit)|Neck\u2019s]] [[Polska]], \"Deep in the sea\u201d (in Swedish N\u00e4ckens Polska, \u201cDjupt i hafvet\u201d) with lyrics by [[Arvid August Afzelius]]. The tune is a traditional Swedish folk tune. The ballad is well known in all the Nordic countries, and is also used the first Danish national play [[Elves' Hill]], Deep in the sea (in Danish Elverh\u00f8j  \u201cDybt i havet\u201d).\nIts use was suggested to Thomas by Nilsson.\n\n\nA tenor suitable for the role of Hamlet could not be found, but an outstanding dramatic baritone, [[Jean-Baptiste Faure]], was available, so Thomas decided to transpose the part, originally written for a tenor, to baritone. In the event, Faure \"achieved a tremendous personal triumph as Hamlet.\"<ref name=Forbes726/>\n\n\n==Performance history==\nThe work was premiered at the [[Paris Op\u00e9ra]] ([[Salle Le Peletier]]) on 9 March 1868.

Claudius places the crown on Gertrude's head. All leave, and Prince Hamlet, son of the late King and Gertrude, enters. He is upset that his mother has remarried so soon. Oph\u00e9lie enters, and they sing a love duet. La\u00ebrte, Oph\u00e9lie's brother, enters. He is being sent to Norway and gives his farewells. He entrusts Oph\u00e9lie to the care of Hamlet. Hamlet refuses to join La\u00ebrte and Oph\u00e9lie as they leave to join the banquet, and goes off in another direction. Courtiers and soldiers, on their way to the banquet, enter the hall. Horatio and Marcellus tell the soldiers that they have seen the ghost of Hamlet's father on the ramparts of the castle the previous night and go off to tell Hamlet.\n\n''Scene 2: The Ramparts''\n\nHoratio and Marcellus meet Hamlet on the ramparts. The Ghost appears, Horatio and Marcellus leave, and the Ghost tells his son that Claudius murdered him with poison. The Ghost commands Hamlet to take vengeance on Claudius, but Gertrude must be spared. The Ghost withdraws. Hamlet draws his sword and swears to avenge his father.\n\n[[File:Christine Nilsson as Ophelia NGO2-607.jpg|thumb|[[Christina Nilsson|Christine Nilsson]] as Oph\u00e9lie]]\n\n===Act 2===\n''Scene 1: The Gardens''\n\nOph\u00e9lie, reading a book, is concerned at Hamlet's new indifference. Hamlet appears in the distance, but leaves without speaking. The Queen enters. Oph\u00e9lie says she would like to leave the court, but the Queen insists she should stay. Oph\u00e9lie leaves the garden and King Claudius enters. Gertrude suspects that Hamlet now knows about the murder of his father, but Claudius says he does not. Hamlet enters and feigns madness. He rejects all overtures of friendship from Claudius, then announces he has engaged a troupe of actors to perform a play that evening. Claudius and Gertrude leave, and the players enter. Hamlet asks them to mime the play ''The Murder of Gonzago'' and then sings a drinking song, playing the fool, so as not to arouse suspicion.\n\n''Scene 2: The Play''\n\nThe King and Queen and the other guests assemble in the castle hall where the stage has been set up. The play begins, and Hamlet narrates. The play tells a story similar to the murder of Hamlet's father. After the \"poison\" is administered, the \"assassin\" places the \"crown\" on his head. Claudius turns pale, rises abruptly, and commands the play to stop and the actors to leave. Hamlet accuses Claudius of the murder of his father, and snatches Claudius' crown from his head. The entire assembly reacts in a grand septet with chorus.\n\n===Act 3===\n''Closet Scene''\n\nIn the Queen's chambers Hamlet delivers the monologue \"To be or not to be\", then hides behind a tapestry. Claudius enters and prays aloud of his remorse. Hamlet, deciding Claudius' soul may be saved, if he is killed while praying, delays yet again. Polonius enters and in his conversation with Claudius reveals his own complicity. The King and Polonius leave, Hamlet emerges, and Gertrude enters with Oph\u00e9lie. The Queen tries to persuade Hamlet to marry Oph\u00e9lie, but Hamlet, realizing he can no longer marry the daughter of the guilty Polonius, refuses. Oph\u00e9lie returns her ring to Hamlet and leaves. Hamlet tries to force Gertrude to confront her guilt, but she resists. As Hamlet threatens her, he sees the Ghost, who reminds him he must spare his mother.\n\n===Act 4===\n''The Mad Scene''\n\nAfter Hamlet's rejection, Oph\u00e9lie has gone mad and drowns herself in the lake.\n\n===Act 5===\n''Gravediggers Scene''\n\nHamlet comes upon two gravediggers digging a new grave. He asks who has died, but they do not know. He sings of remorse for his ill treatment of Oph\u00e9lie. La\u00ebrte, who has returned from Norway and learned of his sister's death and Hamlet's role in it, enters and challenges Hamlet to a duel. They fight, and Hamlet is wounded, but Oph\u00e9lie's funeral procession interrupts the duel. Hamlet finally realizes she is dead. The Ghost appears again and exhorts Hamlet to kill Claudius, which Hamlet does, avenging his father's death. The Ghost affirms Claudius' guilt and Hamlet's innocence. Hamlet, still in despair, is proclaimed King to cries of \"Long live Hamlet! Long live the King!\".\n\n:[In the much shorter \"Covent Garden\" ending the ghost does not appear, and, after Hamlet finally attacks and kills Claudius, he embraces Oph\u00e9lie's body and dies.

The opera begins with a brief prelude approximately three and a half minutes in length.

Introduction, march and chorus.''' The court celebrates the Coronation of Gertrude, widow of King Hamlet; and her marriage to his brother, Claudius (Courtiers: ''Que nos chants montent jusqu'aux cieux'' &ndash; \"Let our songs rise to the skies\"). The new king, Claudius, stands before his throne on a dais, surrounded by the nobles of the court. His court chancellor, Polonius, is nearby. Queen Gertrude enters, approaches the dais, and bows to the King (Courtiers: ''Salut, \u00f4 Reine bien-aim\u00e9e!'' &ndash; \"Greetings, O beloved Queen!\"). Polonius hands the King a crown, which he takes and places on her head (The King: ''\u00d4 toi, qui fus la femme de mon fr\u00e8re'' &ndash; \"O you who were my brother's wife\"). Gertrude comments in an [[aside]] to Claudius that she does not see her son Hamlet. Claudius admonishes her to bear herself as a queen. The courtiers sing of their joy as they celebrate the King and Queen's glorious marriage (Courtiers: ''Le deuil fait place aux chants joyeux'' &ndash; \"Mourning gives way to joyful songs\"). The King and Queen leave the hall followed by the courtiers.\n\n'''2. Recitative and duet.''' Prince Hamlet, son of the late King and Gertrude, enters the empty hall. As Hamlet enters, before he begins singing, the low strings in the orchestra play '''Hamlet's Theme''':<ref name=\"Fauser\"/>\n{| align=\"center\"\n|-\n|[[File:Hamlet's Theme - Ambroise Thomas (piano-vocal score p24).jpg|thumb|500px|Hamlet's Theme from act 1.

Tendresse \u00e9ph\u00e9m\u00e8re!'' &ndash; \"Futile regrets! Ephemeral tenderness!\").\n\nOph\u00e9lie enters. Her entrance is accompanied by '''Oph\u00e9lie's Theme'''. According to the German musicologist Annegret Fauser, Oph\u00e9lie's music contrasts with Hamlet's very regular 8-bar phrase: the 4-bar theme accentuates her nervous character by the use of dotted-note rhythms, a chromatic melody line, and high-range woodwind instruments. The excerpt below ends with 3 bars of florid solo flute music which foreshadows Oph\u00e9lie's [[coloratura]] singing later in the opera.<ref name=Fauser/>\n{| align=\"center\"\n|-\n|[[File:Ophelia's Theme - Hamlet - Ambroise Thomas (piano-vocal score pp26-27).jpg|thumbnail|500px|Oph\u00e9lie's Theme from act 1 (first 4 bars).

Hamlet protests he cannot make promises of love one day, only to forget them the next. His heart is not that of a woman. Oph\u00e9lie is distraught at the insult, and Hamlet begs forgiveness.\n\nThe '''duet''' affirms their love (Hamlet, Oph\u00e9lie: ''Doute de la lumi\u00e8re'' &ndash; \"Doubt that the light\"). The text of the duet is based on Shakespeare's \"Doubt thou the stars are fire\", which is part of a letter from Hamlet to Ophelia which Polonius reads to Gertrude and Claudius. The melody of the vocal line in Hamlet's first phrases has been called the '''Theme of Hamlet's Love for Oph\u00e9lie''' and appears several more times in the opera, with particular poignancy near the end of the Mad Scene (see [[#Mad Scene|below]]).<ref name=Fauser/>\n{| align=\"center\"\n|-\n|[[File:Theme of Hamlet's Love for Ophelia - Ambroise Thomas (piano-vocal score p30).jpg|thumbnail|500px|Theme of Hamlet's Love for Ophelia from act 1.

They reoccur, usually in modified form, whenever significant situations relevant to the ideas they represent present themselves, although without having, in the Wagnerian sense, a [[leitmotiv]]ic function.<ref name=Fauser/>\n\n'''3. Recitative and cavatina of La\u00ebrte.''' Oph\u00e9lie's brother, La\u00ebrte, enters. He tells Hamlet and Oph\u00e9lie that the King is sending him to the court of Norway, and he must leave that very night (unlike in the play where, as Matthew Gurewitsch of ''[[Opera News]]'' has said, he embarks for \"the fleshpots of Paris\").<ref name=Gurewitsch>Gurewitsch, Matthew (March 2010).

Subscription required.</ref> In his cavatina, La\u00ebrte asks Hamlet to watch over his sister while he is gone (La\u00ebrte: ''Pour mon pays, en serviteur fid\u00e8le'' &ndash; \"For my country, in faithful service\"). (In the play Laertes warns Ophelia to be wary of Hamlet's intentions.) Fanfares are heard as servants and pages pass at the back. La\u00ebrte asks Hamlet and Oph\u00e9lie to come with him to the banquet, but Hamlet declines. The couple separates, as La\u00ebrte and Oph\u00e9lie leave for the banquet, and Hamlet goes off in the other direction. More fanfares are heard as lords and ladies enter on their way to the banquet (Lords and Ladies: ''Honneur, honneur au Roi!'' &ndash; \"Honor, honor to the King!\"). They are followed by a group of young officers.\n\n'''4. Chorus of Officers and Pages.''' The officers sing of their hope that the call of pleasure will dispel their current ennui (Officers: ''Nargue de la tristesse!'' &ndash; \"Scoff at sorrow\"). Horatio and Marcellus enter in haste, looking for Hamlet. They tell of having seen the ghost of the late King upon the ramparts the previous night. The skeptical officers respond: \"An absurd illusion! Lies and sorcery!\" Undeterred, Horatio and Marcellus leave to find and warn the young prince. The officers, with the lords and ladies, finish the chorus and depart for the banquet. (Again, this scene is unlike the play in which Horatio, who has not seen the ghost himself but has merely heard of it from the sentinels, reports the news of the ghost's appearance to Hamlet directly, and not to a group of soldiers. For some reason Matthew Gurewitsch finds this change somewhat odd: \"Horatio and a sidekick blab the dread news of the Ghost's appearance to a squadron of frolicking young officers, who are totally unimpressed.\")<ref name=Gurewitsch/>\n\n'''<big>Scene 2</big>'''\n\n''The ramparts.

The five-minute prelude sets the sinister atmosphere of the scene.\n\n'''5. Scene at the ramparts.''' Horatio and Marcellus enter (Horatio: ''Viendra-t-il?'' &ndash; \"Will he come?\") and are soon followed by Hamlet (Hamlet: ''Horatio! n'est-ce point vous?'' &ndash; \"Horatio! is that you?\"). Horatio and Marcellus tell Hamlet that they have seen his father's ghost on the previous night at the stroke of twelve. Fanfares are heard emanating from the banquet hall within the castle, and soon thereafter the bells begin to toll midnight. The ghost appears, and they express their fear.\n\n'''Invocation.''' Hamlet addresses the Ghost (Hamlet: ''Spectre infernal! Image vener\u00e9e!'' &ndash; \"Infernal apparition! Venerated image!\"). The ghost gives a sign indicating that Horatio and Marcellus should withdraw, and Hamlet orders them to do so. The ghost speaks: ''\u00c9coute-moi!'' &ndash; \"Listen to me!\". He identifies himself and commands Hamlet to avenge him. Hamlet asks what is the crime he must avenge, and who has committed it? Sounds of music from within the castle, fanfares, and distant cannon are heard, and the Ghost responds: \"Hark: it is he they are honoring, he who they have proclaimed King! ... The adulterer has defiled my royal residence: and he, to make his treason more complete, spying upon my sleep and taking advantage of the hour, poured poison on my sleeping lips. ... Avenge me, my son! Avenge your father! ... From your mother, though, turn your anger away, we must leave punishment in the care of heaven.\" The ghost withdraws, his parting words: ''Souviens-toi!'' &ndash; \"Remember me!\" Hamlet draws his sword and proclaims his intention to obey the ghost's command (Hamlet: ''Ombre ch\u00e9re, ombre vengeresse, j'exaucerai ton v\u0153u! ... je me souviendrai!'' &ndash; \"Beloved shade, avenging shade, I shall fulfill your command! ... I shall remember!\").

Aria of Oph\u00e9lie.''' Oph\u00e9lie is in the garden with a book in her hand. She laments Hamlet's distance, feeling his look is something like reproach (Oph\u00e9lie: ''Sa main depuis hier n'a pas touch\u00e9 ma main!'' &ndash; \"His hand has not touched mine since yesterday\"). She reads from her book, at first silently, then aloud (Oph\u00e9lie: ''\"Adieu, dit-il, ayez-foi!\"'' &ndash; \"'Adieu, he said, trust me!'\"). Hamlet appears on the other side of the garden. (An [[English horn]] plays the '''Theme of Hamlet's Love'''.) Hamlet sees Oph\u00e9lie and tarries. Again she reads aloud from her book (Oph\u00e9lie: ''\"En vous, cruel, j'avais foi! Je vous aimais, aimez moi!\"'' &ndash; \"'In you, O cruel one, I believed. I loved you! Love me too!'\"), then looks at Hamlet. However, he remains silent, then rushes away. Oph\u00e9lie says ruefully: ''Ah! ce livre a dit vrai!'' &ndash; \"Ah! This book spoke the truth!\" and continues her aria (Oph\u00e9lie: ''Les serments on des ailes!'' &ndash; \"Promises have wings!\").\n\n'''7. Recitative and arioso.''' The Queen comes into the garden hoping to find Hamlet. She sees Oph\u00e9lie's distress and presses her for information as to its cause (The Queen: ''Je croyais pr\u00e8s de vous trouver mon fils'' &ndash; \"I thought to find my son with you\"). Oph\u00e9lie says Hamlet no longer loves her and begs permission to leave the court. In the Queen's arioso, one of the finest numbers in the score,<ref name=Forbes22/> she rejects Oph\u00e9lie's request, saying that the barrier between Oph\u00e9lie and Hamlet comes from another source (The Queen: ''Dans sons regards plus sombre'' &ndash; \"In his sombre expression\"). She argues that Oph\u00e9lie's presence may help cure Hamlet of his madness. Oph\u00e9lie says she shall obey and leaves.\n\n'''8. Duet.''' The King now comes into the garden (The King: ''L'\u00e2me de votre fils est \u00e0 jamais troubl\u00e9e, Madame'' &ndash; \"Your son's soul is ever troubled, Madame\"). The Queen suggests Hamlet may have discovered the truth, but Claudius believes he suspects nothing.\n\nAn extended version of this very short duet appears in the piano-vocal score.<ref>[[#PianoVocalScore|Thomas, Ambroise (1868)]], pp. 107&ndash;117.</ref> Only the initial phrases of this passage are found in the original full score, and the section which begins with the Queen's phrase ''H\u00e9las! Dieu m'\u00e9pargne la honte'' &ndash; \"Alas! may God spare me the shame\" is marked as a possible cut. The scoring of the remainder of the duet was thought lost. The original manuscript with the full score of the duet was recently found at the [[Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France]] in Paris.<ref name=Forbes22/> The uncut duet is performed in the video recording with [[Simon Keenlyside]] as Hamlet.<ref>[[#Videos|DVD with Simon Keenlyside as Hamlet]], Disc 1, Chapter 13 (1:04:17&ndash;1:08:48).</ref> It is included as an appendix in the recording with [[Thomas Hampson]] as Hamlet (see [[#Recordings|Recordings]]).<ref name=Forbes22/>\n\n'''Recitative.''' At the conclusion of the duet Hamlet enters, and the orchestra plays '''Hamlet's Theme'''.<ref>[[#PianoVocalScore|Thomas, Ambroise (1868)]], pp. 118&ndash;120.</ref> When the 8-bar theme has concluded, the King calls to Hamlet (The King: ''Cher Hamlet'' &ndash; \"Dear Hamlet\"), and Hamlet responds \"Sire!\". Claudius asks Hamlet to refer to him as Father, but Hamlet responds that his father is dead. Claudius offers his hand, in Hamlet's father's name. There is a pause as the orchestra begins again to play Hamlet's Theme, and Hamlet responds: \"His is cold and lifeless.\" When the theme has finished, Claudius calls Hamlet \"My son...\", but Hamlet angrily responds: \"My name is Hamlet!\", and starts to walk away. The orchestra begins Hamlet's Theme again, and Gertrude asks whether Hamlet seeks the young and beautiful Oph\u00e9lie, but Hamlet responds that youth and beauty will vanish in a single day. When the orchestra has finished playing Hamlet's Theme, Claudius suggests that Hamlet may wish to travel abroad, to France and Italy, but Hamlet responds he'd rather travel, like the clouds, among the stars, amid bolts of lightning.\n\nThere is a distant sound of festive music. The theme employed is that of the Danish March (which accompanies the entrance of the royal court in the following Play Scene).<ref>[[#PianoVocalScore|Thomas, Ambroise (1868)]], p. 122.</ref> The King tells Hamlet to listen to the sound of the festivities and admonishes him to hold up his head. Hamlet announces he has summoned an itinerant troupe of actors to provide entertainment. Claudius agrees to this, and then says to Gertrude, \"He knows nothing!\", but she replies \"I am afraid!\" as they turn to leave. The orchestra begins to play the theme of '''Hamlet's Promise''', and Hamlet sings: ''Mon p\u00e9re! Patience! Patience!'' &ndash; \"My father! Patience! Patience!\".<ref>[[#PianoVocalScore|Thomas, Ambroise (1868)]], p. 124.</ref>\n\n'''9. Recitative and chorus of comedians.''' Marcellus and Horatio enter with the Players (tenors and basses). Marcellus announces: ''Voici les histrions mand\u00e9s par vous, Seigneur.'' &ndash; \"Here are the actors you sent for, my lord.\" The players sing a chorus (Players: ''Princes sans apanages'' &ndash; \"Princes without privilege\").<ref>This chorus is omitted in the video recording with Simon Keenlyside as Hamlet. See [[#Videos|DVD with Simon Keenlyside as Hamlet]], Disc 1, Chapter 13 (1:14:21).</ref> In an aside Hamlet reveals his true purpose (Hamlet: ''C'est en croyant revoir se dresser sa victime que plus d'un meurtrier a confess\u00e9 son crime'' &ndash; \"In believing he sees his victim rise up, more than one murderer has confessed his crime\"). He asks the players to enact the play ''The Murder of Gonzago'', saying he shall tell them when to pour the poison. He then asks the pages to bring in wine for all.\n\n'''10. ''Chanson Bacchique''.''' Seizing a goblet, Hamlet sings a song in praise of wine (Hamlet: ''\u00d4 vin, dissipe la tristesse qui p\u00e9se sur mon c\u0153ur! \u00c0 moi les r\u00eaves de l'ivresse et le rire moqueur!'' &ndash; \"O wine, dispel the sorrow which weighs on my heart! Give me dreams of euphoria and the mocking laugh!\"). In a florid [[cadenza]] it rises to a high G ([[Scientific pitch notation|G4]]). (An easier version with fewer notes and a lower top note, F ([[Scientific pitch notation|F4]]), is also included in the score.)<ref>[[#PianoVocalScore|Thomas, Ambroise (1868)]], p. 136.</ref> This drinking song, which is not found in Shakespeare, has been the object of much negative criticism.

The royal throne is on the right, a platform for the courtiers on the left; at the back, a small theatre, curtains closed'' (set by [[Charles-Antoine Cambon]])''.''\n\n'''11. Danish march.''' The entrance of the royal court is accompanied by a four-and-a-half minute [[March (music)|march]] in ''[[alla breve]]'' time and [[Ternary form|A-B-A form]] which is introduced with a fanfare. The theme of the A section was first heard near the end of the trio recitative with Claudius, Hamlet, and Gertrude in the first scene of act 2. The King and Queen enter first, followed by Polonius, Oph\u00e9lie, Hamlet, Horatio, Marcellus, and the court.<ref>In the video recording with Simon Keenlyside this scenic transformation occurs with the curtain up. A long banquet table is rolled from the wings at the conclusion of the ''Chanson Bacchique'' as the orchestra finishes playing. Hamlet remains on stage, and after the applause, a truncated version of the march (fanfare and first A section, just under one minute) is heard as Oph\u00e9lie, on the arm of her father Polonius, and Horatio, Marcellus, and the courtiers arrive. The King and Queen arrive last. ([[#Videos|DVD with Simon Keenlyside as Hamlet]], Disc 1, Chapter (1:04:17&ndash;1:08:48).</ref>\n\n'''Recitative and prologue.''' Hamlet asks Oph\u00e9lie if he may sit at her feet (Hamlet: ''Belle, permettez-nous'' &ndash; \"Lady, permit me\"). She responds that his expression frightens and chills her. Hamlet sits, his eyes fixed on the King and Queen. Everyone takes their places, and the curtains of the small theatre are opened. The play is introduced with a short orchestral passage featuring a [[saxophone]] solo. (According to Annegret Fauser this is the first instance of the use of a saxophone in an opera.)<ref>Fauser (1993), p.</ref> In an aside Hamlet asks Marcellus to watch the King (Hamlet: ''Voici l'instant! fixez vos regards sur le Roi, et, si vous le voyez p\u00e2lir, dites-le moi!'' &ndash; \"Now! Fix your gaze on upon the King, and, if he should turn pale, tell me!\").\n\n'''12. Pantomime and finale.''' On the small stage an aged king wearing a crown enters slowly on the arm of a queen whose features and costume are similar to those of Queen Gertrude. Hamlet, whose eyes never leave the face of King Claudius, narrates the action of the mimed play (Hamlet: ''C'est le vieux Roi Gonzague et la Reine Geni\u00e8vre'' &ndash; \"This is the aged King Gonzago and Queen Guinevere\"). The play proceeds as follows: With protestations of love Guinevere leads Gonzago to a lonely spot. The drowsy king soon falls asleep in her arms. The villain enters. She holds out a cup, he seizes it, and pours the fatal potion, then takes the crown and places it on his head.\n\nAt this point Hamlet interrupts his narrative and addresses Claudius directly (Hamlet: ''Sire, vous p\u00e2lissez'' &ndash; \"Sire, you grow pale!\"). Angered and fearful, the King rises (The King: ''Chassez, chassez d'ici ces vils histrions!'' &ndash; \"Expel, expel these vile minstrels!\"). Hamlet, feigning madness, accuses Claudius of the murder of his father (Hamlet: ''C'est lui qui versait le poison!'' &ndash; \"He's the one who poured the poison!\"). Hamlet approaches the King, pushing aside the courtiers who surround him, and snatches the crown from Claudius' head (Hamlet: ''A bas, masque menteur! vaine couronne, \u00e0 bas!'' &ndash; \"Down with the lying mask! Down with the empty crown!\").\n\nThe King, pulling himself together, solemnly declares: ''\u00d4 mortelle offense! Aveugle d\u00e9mence, qui glace tous les c\u0153urs d'effroi!'' &ndash; \"O fatal insult! Blind lunacy, which chills every heart with dread!\" The melody of the vocal line is a variant of the theme of '''Hamlet's Promise'''. Oph\u00e9lie cries out, and the Queen declares her outrage (The Queen: ''Dans sa folle rage, il brave, il outrage'' &ndash; \"In his mad rage, he defies, he offends\"). These utterances of the King and the Queen begin a grand ensemble passage, \"a magnificent septet\",<ref name=Forbes611>Forbes, Elizabeth, \"Hamlet\" in [[#NewGroveOpera|Sadie (1992)]] '''2''': 611.</ref> which builds to a climax in which Hamlet bursts out in \"mad Berlioz-like excitement\"<ref name=Greenfield/> with snatches of the '''''Chanson Bacchique'''''. At the end, Hamlet totally collapses. The King rushes out, followed by the Queen, and the entire court.\n\n===Act 3===\n'''<big>\"Closet Scene\"</big>'''\n\n''A chamber in the Queen's apartments. At the back are two full-length portraits of the two kings. A [[prie-Dieu]]. A lamp burns on a table'' (set by [[\u00c9douard Desplechin]])''.''\n\n'''Entr'acte.''' The act begins with a short but powerful introduction, \"almost Verdian\"<ref name=Salter /> in its effect. Fortissimo French horns play the variant of '''Hamlet's Promise''' (the King's ''\u00d4 mortelle offense!'') which began the septet that closed act 2. The music becomes more agitated, reflecting Hamlet's highly conflicted state of mind. The trumpets sound mutated snippets of the royal court's Danish march.<ref name=Fauser />\n\n'''13. Monologue.''' Hamlet is alone and seated on a couch. He chastises himself for his failure to act (Hamlet: ''J'ai pu frapper le mis\u00e9rable'' &ndash; \"I could have killed the scoundrel.\") This leads to a calmer, more introspective section (Hamlet: ''\u00catre ou ne pas \u00eatre'' &ndash; \"To be or not to be\"), which follows the Shakespeare original closely, although greatly shortened.<ref name=Gurewitsch/><ref name=\"Forbes24\"/> He hears someone approaching (Hamlet: ''Mais qui donc ose ici me suivre? Le Roi!...'' &ndash; \"But who then dares to follow me here? The King!...\"). He hides behind a tapestry (arras).\n\n'''14. Recitative and bass aria.''' The King enters. He muses to himself (The King: ''C'est en vain que j'ai cru me soustraire aux remords.'' &ndash; \"In vain have I thought to escape my remorse.\"). The King kneels at the prie-Dieu and prays aloud (The King: ''Je t'implore, \u00f4 mon fr\u00e8re!'' &ndash; \"I implore you, O my brother!\"). Hamlet overhears and fears Claudius' remorse could yet save his soul. He therefore delays yet again, deciding that Claudius must be dispatched in drunken revels at the court. The King rises. Thinking he has seen a ghost, he calls out for Polonius. Polonius comes rushing in. The King tells him he has seen the ghost of the dead king. Polonius tries to calm the King and warns him to beware lest a word betray them both. The King rushes out followed by Polonius. Hamlet emerges from behind the tapestry (Hamlet: ''Polonius est son complice! le p\u00e8re d'Oph\u00e9lie!'' &ndash; \"Polonius is his accomplice. Ophelia's father!\"). He regrets having overheard this terrible revelation.\n\n[[File:Nellie Melba as Ophelia in Hamlet (opera) - Henri Gervex ON2010-03-12.jpg|thumb|[[Nellie Melba]] as Oph\u00e9lie, by [[Henri Gervex]]]]\n'''15. Trio.''' Oph\u00e9lie enters with the Queen. (The Queen: ''Le voil\u00e0! Je veux lire enfin dans sa pens\u00e9e'' &ndash; \"There he is! I must know what is on his mind\"). The Queen tells Hamlet, the altar awaits him, here is his betrothed. Hamlet looks away, without replying. The Queen persists. Hamlet thinks of Polonius' perfidy (Hamlet: ''Sur moi tombent les cieux avant que cet hymen funeste s'accomplisse!'' &ndash; \"May the heavens fall upon me before such an ill-fated marriage can be solemnized!\"). Oph\u00e9lie asks what he means. He responds: ''Non! Allez dans un clo\u00eetre, allez, Oph\u00e9lie.'' &ndash; \"No! Go to a nunnery, go, Oph\u00e9lie.\"). The Queen asks whether he has forgotten all Oph\u00e9lie's virtues. He replies he now feels nothing in his heart. Oph\u00e9lie despairs (Oph\u00e9lie: ''Cet amor promis \u00e0 genoux'' &ndash; \"The love that on your knees you swore\"). She returns her ring to him ('''Theme of Hamlet's Love'''), and Hamlet weeps. The Queen turns to Oph\u00e9lie saying he weeps, he remembers, he loves you. Hamlet cries out again (Hamlet: ''Non! Allez dans un clo\u00eetre, allez, Oph\u00e9lie'' &ndash; \"No! Go to a nunnery, go, Oph\u00e9lie\"). Each continues to express conflicting feelings in an extended ensemble. Oph\u00e9lie leaves, hiding her tears.\n\n'''16. Duet.''' The Queen warns Hamlet that he has offended his father, and she may be powerless to save his life (The Queen: ''Hamlet, ma douleur est immense!'' &ndash; \"Hamlet, my grief is great!\"). Hamlet asks, who has offended his father? She denies any understanding of his meaning. Hamlet blocks her attempt to leave, tries to force her to confront her guilt (Hamlet: ''Ah! que votre \u00e2me sans refuge pleure sur les devoirs trahis'' &ndash; \"Ah! Let your defenseless heart weep over duties betrayed\"). Hamlet leads his mother to the two portraits and points to the portrait of his father (Hamlet: ''Ici la gr\u00e2ce et la beaut\u00e9 sereines'' &ndash; \"Here are grace and serene beauty\"), then to the other portrait (''L\u00e0, tous les crimes de la terre!'' &ndash; \"There, all crimes of the earth!\"). The Queen begs for mercy, kneeling before Hamlet (The Queen: ''Pardonne, h\u00e9las! ta voix m'accable!'' &ndash; Forgive me, alas! Your voice devastates me!\"). The Queen collapses on a couch. The orchestra repeats the distinctive [[ostinato]] first heard in the Ramparts Scene as the accompaniment to Hamlet's aria (''Spectre infernal!''). The light dims, and the Ghost appears behind the couch, one arm extended toward Hamlet (Ghost: ''Mon fils!'' &ndash; \"My son!\"). Hamlet pulls back in confusion. The Ghost warns Hamlet (Ghost: ''Souviens-toi... mais \u00e9pargne ta m\u00e8re!'' &ndash; \"Do not forget... but spare your mother!\"). As the Ghost vanishes, the orchestra plays the theme of '''Hamlet's Promise''', and the doors close themselves. Hamlet asks his mother not to think he is mad; his rage has calmed. He tells her to repent and sleep in peace, then leaves. She collapses at the foot of the prie-Dieu.\n\nElizabeth Forbes states that the final duet of act 3 represents the climax of the act and the pivotal scene of the entire opera,<ref name=Forbes24 /> and the act as a whole \"is by far the finest of the opera, musically as well as dramatically.\"<ref name=Forbes22 />\n\n===Act 4===\n''A pastoral spot surrounded by trees. At the back, a lake dotted with verdant islets and bordered with willows and rushes. The day breaks and floods the scene with cheerful light'' (set by [[\u00c9douard Desplechin]])''.''\n\n'''17. Entr'acte.'''

A party of young Danish peasants enters, and a spring country festival ensues (Peasants: ''Voici la riante saison'' \u2013 \"The fun season is here\").\n: '''B\u2013F.''' The ballet proper, which lasts about 18 minutes, consists of the following sections:\n:: B. Pas des chasseurs\n:: C. Pantomime\n:: D. Valse-Mazurka\n:: E. Sc\u00e8ne du bouquet \u2013 La Freya\n:: F. Strette finale\n\nThe recording conducted by [[Richard Bonynge]] (with [[Sherrill Milnes]] as Hamlet and [[Joan Sutherland]] as Ophelia) includes the ballet music in its proper place at the beginning of act 4, but omits significant portions of it.<!--\n\n--><ref>Bonynge's recording is based on a production he prepared for Sydney, Australia. The cuts include (page nos. refer to the [[#Scores|piano-vocal score]]): in the \"Danse Villageoise\", the second repeat (pp. 242\u2013243) and 24 bars of the chorus (pp. 247\u2013248); in the \"Pas des chasseurs\", the final 71 bars of 121 total (pp. 253\u2013255) [the recording with Hampson also omits the final 20 bars as given in the vocal score; these may not be in the full score]; in the \"Valse-Mazurke\", the repeated section with the first and second ending (pp. 260\u2013261) as well as the first 16 bars of the following section (p. 262), the first 7 bars at the top of p. 264, the final 20 bars on p. 265, and 6 bars beginning 11 bars from the end (p. 266); in the \"Sc\u00e8ne du bouquet,\" the final 10 bars marked \"Un peu plus lent\" (p. 267); in \"La Freya\", the first four pages (268\u2013271) out of eleven total; and in the \"Strette finale\", only the first 22 bars of the 62-bar Allegro are played before a jump to the section marked \"Moins vite\" on p. 282. In total, these cuts reduce the ballet proper (sections B\u2013F) to less than 15 minutes of music.

The peasants see a young girl approaching (Peasants: ''Mais quelle est cette belle et jeune demoiselle'' \u2013 \"But who is this fair young maiden\").\n\nOph\u00e9lie enters, dressed in a long white gown and with her hair bizarrely adorned with flowers and creepers (Oph\u00e9lie: ''A vos jeux, mes amis, permettez-moi de gr\u00e2ce de prendre part!'' \u2013 \"My friends, please allow me to join in your games!\"). Oph\u00e9lie's opening recitative is interrupted by a [[florid music|florid]] [[cadenza]] with an ascending run up to a [[Trill (music)|trill]] on a [[forte (music)|forte]] A ([[Scientific pitch notation|A5]]).<ref>[[#PianoVocalScore|Thomas, Ambroise (1868)]], p. 287.</ref>\n\n'''Andante.''' Oph\u00e9lie tells the peasants that, should they hear that Hamlet has forgotten her, they should not believe it (Oph\u00e9lie: ''Un doux serment nous lie'' \u2013 \"A tender promise binds us to each other\").

In a more difficult alternative version, the trill on F finishes with an upward leap to forte high D ([[Scientific pitch notation|D6]]) and a quick passage descending to middle B-flat ([[Scientific pitch notation|B{{music|b}}4]]), followed by an upward octave leap to a final forte high B flat ([[Scientific pitch notation|B{{music|b}}5]]) which is held.<ref>[[#PianoVocalScore|Thomas, Ambroise (1868)]], p. 292.</ref>\n{| align=\"center\"\n|-\n|[[File:Final cadenza Valse Mad Scene Hamlet (piano-vocal score p292).jpg|thumbnail|500px|Final cadenza and variant from the Valse ([[#PianoVocalScore|piano-vocal score, p. 292]])]]\n|{{Spaces|10}}\n|}\n\n'''Ballade.''' In the mournful Ballade, Oph\u00e9lie sings about the Willis (water sprite) who lures lovers to their death, dragging them under the water until they drown (Oph\u00e9lie: ''Et maintenant \u00e9coutez ma chanson. P\u00e2le et blonde, dort sous l'onde profonde'' \u2013 \"And now listen to my song. Pale and fair, sleeping under the deep waves\"). (The Ballade replaces Shakespeare's \"Tomorrow is St. Valentine's Day\", the bawdy words of which were probably considered inappropriate at the Op\u00e9ra.)<ref name=Forbes24/> It includes a quantity of coloratura singing, and, in the words of Matthew Gurewitsch, is \"interwoven with a wordless wisp of a refrain, spun out over the nervous pulse of a drum, like birdsong from some undiscovered country.\"<ref name=Gurewitsch/> The Ballade concludes with a coloratura passage that finishes with a run up to a high E ([[Scientific pitch notation|E6]]) and a fortissimo [[Trill (music)|trill]] on A sharp ([[Scientific pitch notation|A5 sharp]]) leading to the final high B ([[Scientific pitch notation|B5]]).<ref name=Forbes24/><ref>[[#PianoVocalScore|Thomas, Ambroise (1868)]], p. 300.</ref>\n\n'''19. Waltz-Ballet.''' A short choral passage (Peasants: ''Sa raison a fui sans retour'' \u2013 \"Her reason has fled, never to return\") introduces an orchestral reprise of the waltz music first heard before the Ballade.\n\n'''20. Finale.''' The final section begins with a soft woodwind chord followed by harp arpeggios with a wordless choral accompaniment ''\u00e0 bouches ferm\u00e9es'' (similar to the \"Humming Chorus\" from Puccini's later opera, ''[[Madama Butterfly]]'') which repeats the theme from ''P\u00e2le et blonde''. Oph\u00e9lie sings: ''Le voil\u00e0! Je crois l'entendre!'' \u2013 \"There he is! I think I hear him!\". As she leans over the water, holding onto the branches of a willow with one hand, and brushing aside the rushes with the other, she repeats some of the words and the melody ('''Theme of Hamlet's Love''')<ref name=Fauser/> from her love duet with Hamlet in act 1 (Oph\u00e9lie: ''Doute de la lumi\u00e8re'' \u2013 \"Doubt that the light illumines\"). One sees her momentarily floating in her white gown, as the current carries her away. (The action follows Gertrude's description of Ophelia's death in Shakespeare's act 4, scene 7.)<ref name=GertrudeActIVSc7>[http://www.lieder.net/lieder/get_text.html?TextId=19190 Getrude's monologue from ''Hamlet'', act 4, scene 7, at \"The Lied and Art Song Texts Page\"].</ref>\n\nAccording to Elizabeth Forbes, the opera's initial success at the Op\u00e9ra was undoubtedly mostly due to the spectacular vocal effects of the \"Mad Scene\" as executed by the original Oph\u00e9lie, [[Christine Nilsson]].<ref name=Forbes24/>\n\n===Act 5===\n''The graveyard near Elsinore.''\n\n'''21. Song of the Gravediggers.''' Two gravediggers are digging a grave (First Gravedigger: ''Dame ou prince, homme ou femme'' &ndash; \"Lady or prince, man or woman\"). '''Hamlet's Theme''' is heard in the orchestra, and he appears in the distance and slowly approaches (both Gravediggers: ''Jeune ou vieux, brune ou blonde'' &ndash; \"Young or old, dark or fair\"). They drink and sing of the pleasures of wine. Hamlet asks for whom the grave is intended. The gravediggers do not remember. (After this shortened version of the gravediggers scene, the action diverges radically from that of the Shakespeare play.)\n\n'''22. Recitative and arioso.''' Hamlet, realizing that Oph\u00e9lie has gone mad, but still unaware that she is dead, begs forgiveness for his ill treatment of her (Hamlet: ''Comme une p\u00e2le fleur'' &ndash; \"Like a delicate flower\").\n\nThe English music critic [[John Steane]], reviewing [[Simon Keenlyside]]'s performance of this aria, wrote:<blockquote>Coming after the grave-diggers' scene, it is a tender yet bitterly repentant elegy on Ophelia's death. The soliloquy has no counterpart in Shakespeare and brings out the best in both Thomas and Keenlyside. From the composer it draws on the graceful French lyricism we know from the tenor solos in ''Mignon'', adding a more complex responsiveness to the opera-Hamlet's simpler nature. For the singer, it provides an opportunity to use the refinement of his art yet rise to phrases, high in the voice, where he can expand the riches of his tones and the most heartfelt of his feelings.<ref>[[John Steane]], ''[[Gramophone (magazine)|Gramophone]]'', September 2003, p. 20.</ref></blockquote>\n\n'''Scene and recitative.''' La\u00ebrte appears in the distance, enveloped in a cape (Hamlet: ''Mais qui marche dans l'ombre? Horatio?'' &ndash; \"Who walks in the shadows? Horatio?\"). Hamlet calls out to him, and La\u00ebrte answers and comes nearer (La\u00ebrte: ''Vous avez fr\u00e9mi, Prince? ... Oui, je suis de retour; c'est moi!'' &ndash; \"Were you afraid, Prince? ... Yes, I have returned; it is I!\"). Knowing of Oph\u00e9lie's death, La\u00ebrte seeks revenge, and challenges Hamlet to a duel. They fight, and Hamlet is wounded.\n\n'''23. Funeral march and chorus.''' A funeral march is heard (Hamlet: ''\u00c9coute! Quel est ce bruit de pas?'' &ndash; \"Listen! What noise is that?\"). He asks La\u00ebrte: \"Who has died?\" La\u00ebrte, in an aside, is amazed that Hamlet still does not know. The funeral procession appears, led by a choir of men and women (Choir: ''Comme la fleur, comme la fleur nouvelle'' &ndash; \"Like a flower, like a fresh flower\"). Oph\u00e9lie's body is carried in; the King and Queen, Polonius, Marcellus, Horatio and the courtiers follow behind.\n\n'''24. Finale.''' Hamlet finally realizes who has died (Hamlet: ''Oph\u00e9lie! ... Morte! glac\u00e9e! \u00d4 crime! Oh! de leurs noirs complots d\u00e9plorable victime!'' &ndash; \"Oph\u00e9lie! ... Dead! Cold! A crime! Oh! Lamentable victim of their black conspiracy!\"). He kneels beside the body of Oph\u00e9lie: \"I have lost you!\" As the grieving Hamlet prepares to kill himself, his father's Ghost appears, visible to everyone. The King cries out \"Mercy!\", and the Ghost responds: \"The hour has passed! You, my son, finish what you have begun!\" Hamlet cries: \"Ah! Strengthen my arm to run him through. Guide my strike!\" He hurls himself upon the King. The King falls. The Queen cries out \"Dieu!\" as the others exclaim: \"The King!\" Hamlet responds: \"No! The murderer! The murderer of my father!\" The Ghost affirms: \"The crime is avenged! The cloister awaits your mother!\" The King dies with the words: ''Je meur maudit!'' &ndash; \"I die accursed!\" The Queen begs God for forgiveness, as the Ghost declares: \"Live for your people, Hamlet! God has made you King.\" Hamlet, in despair, sings: ''Mon \u00e2me est dans la tombe, h\u00e9las! Et je suis Roi!'' &ndash; \"My spirit is in the grave, alas! And I am King!\" Everyone else proclaims: \"Long live Hamlet! Long live the King!\" and the opera ends.\n\n===Alternative endings===\nA shorter version of the Finale, in which Hamlet dies, and the Ghost does not appear, is called \"le d\u00e9nouement du [[Covent Garden Theatre|The\u00e2tre de Covent Garden]]\" (\"the ending for Covent Garden\"). Thomas may have written it in the belief that the English would not accept an adaptation in which Hamlet lives. There is no evidence, however, that it was performed in Thomas's lifetime, either at Covent Garden or anywhere else. It appears in some German vocal scores and is included as an appendix to the recording with [[Thomas Hampson]] as Hamlet.\n\nThere is an additional ending prepared by [[Richard Bonynge]] for a performance in [[Sydney|Sydney, Australia]] in 1982 in which Hamlet dies of his wound suffered in the duel with La\u00ebrte. This ending appears in the recording with [[Sherrill Milnes]] as Hamlet, conducted by Bonynge.<ref name=\"Forbes26\"/>\n\n==Recordings==\n'''Audio'''\n* [[Sherrill Milnes]] (Hamlet); [[Joan Sutherland]] (Oph\u00e9lie); [[James Morris (bass-baritone)|James Morris]] (Claudius); [[G\u00f6sta Winbergh]] (La\u00ebrte); [[Barbara Smith Conrad|Barbara Conrad]] (Gertrude); [[John Tomlinson (bass)|John Tomlinson]] (Ghost); Keith Lewis (Marcellus); Philip Gelling (Horatio); Arwel Huw Morgan (Polonius); Peyo Garazzi (First Gravedigger); Joseph Rouleau (Second Gravedigger); Orchestra and Chorus of [[Welsh National Opera]]; [[Richard Bonynge]] (conductor).

On 11 September 1827 the Irish actress [[Harriet Smithson]] played the part of Ophelia in ''Hamlet''.<ref name=Cairns1969p70>[[#Cairns1969|Cairns, David (1969)]], p. 70.</ref>\n[[File:Harriet Smithson as Ophelia 1827 (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|left|Harriet Smithson as Ophelia (1827)]]\nHer mad scene appeared to owe little to tradition and seemed almost like an improvisation, with several contemporary accounts remarking on her astonishing capacity for mime. Her performances produced an extraordinary reaction: men wept openly in the theater, and when they left were \"convulsed by uncontrollable emotion.\"<ref name=Cairns1969p619>[[#Cairns1969|Cairns, David (1969)]], pp. 619&ndash;620.</ref> The twenty-five-year-old [[Alexandre Dumas, p\u00e8re]], who was about to embark on a major career as a novelist and dramatist, was in the audience and found the performance revelatory, \"far surpassing all my expectations\".<ref name=Cairns1999p247>[[#Cairns1999|Cairns, David (1999)]], p. 247.</ref> The French composer [[Hector Berlioz]] was also present at that opening night performance and later wrote: \"The lightning flash of that sublime discovery opened before me at a stroke the whole heaven of art, illuminating it to its remotest depths. I recognized the meaning of dramatic grandeur, beauty, truth.\"<ref name=Cairns1969p70/> Even the wife of the [[Granville Leveson-Gower, 1st Earl Granville|English ambassador]], Lady Granville, felt compelled to report that the Parisians \"roar over Miss Smithson's Ophelia, and strange to say so did I\".<ref>[[#Cairns1999|Cairns, David (1999)]], p. 248.</ref> (The actress's Irish accent and the lack of power in her voice had hindered her success in London.)<ref name=Cairns1969p619/> It wasn't long before new clothing and hair styles, ''\u00e0 la mode d'Oph\u00e9lie'' and modeled on those of the actress, became all the rage in Paris.<ref name=Fauser/>\n\nNot everything about the performance or the play was considered convincing. The supporting players were conceded to be weak. The large number of corpses on the stage in the final scene was found by many to be laughable. But Hamlet's interaction with the ghost of his father, the play-within-the-play, Hamlet's conflict with his mother, Ophelia's mad scene, and the scene with the gravediggers were all found to be amazing and powerful. The moment in the Play Scene when Claudius rises up and interrupts the proceedings, then rushes from the stage, provoked a long and enthusiastic ovation. The journal ''Pandore'' wrote about \"that English candour which allows everything to be expressed and everything to be depicted, and for which nothing in nature is unworthy of imitation by drama\".<ref name=Cairns1999p247/> Dumas felt the play and the performances provided him \"what I was searching for, what I lacked, what I had to find &ndash; actors forgetting they were on stage [...] actual speech and gesture such as made actors creatures of God, with their own virtues, passions and weaknesses, not wooden, impossible heroes booming sonorous platitudes\".<ref name=Cairns1999p247/>\n\nThe composer Berlioz was soon totally infatuated with Miss Smithson. His love for her, initially unrequited, became an obsession and served as inspiration for his music. His ''[[Symphonie fantastique]]'' (''Fantastic Symphony'', 1830) portrays an opium-induced vision in which the musician's beloved appears as a recurrent musical motif, the ''id\u00e9e fixe'', which like any obsession \"finds its way into every incredible situation [movement]\".<ref>Milder, John (1963).

Besides in music, it also manifested itself in art. [[Auguste Pr\u00e9ault]]'s relief ''Oph\u00e9lie'' (1844) depicted a young woman wading into water with her hair let down and swirling in the current.<ref name=Fauser/>\n\n===French versions of the play===\n[[File:DUMAS PERE.jpg|thumb|Alexandre Dumas, p\u00e8re]]\nBy the early 1840s [[Alexandre Dumas, p\u00e8re|Alexandre Dumas]], who had become a personal friend of Berlioz and Smithson,<ref>[[#Barzun|Barzun, Jacques (1969)]], '''1''': 277, 315.</ref> had achieved international fame with his historical novels and dramas. With the heightened interest in Shakespeare, and in particular ''Hamlet'', that had been aroused by Smithson's performances at the Od\u00e9on, he decided to prepare a new French translation of the play to be presented at his [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Historique]]. An earlier verse translation of ''Hamlet'' into French by [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Ducis]], first performed in 1769, was still being given at the [[Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise]], and Dumas knew the leading role by heart. The Ducis play bore very little resemblance to the Shakespeare original. There were far fewer characters: no ghost, no Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, no players, no gravediggers. There was no duel, and Hamlet did not die at the end. Modifications such as these were necessary to gain performances in the French theaters of his time. Ducis had told the English actor-impresario [[David Garrick]] that a ghost which speaks, itinerant players, and a fencing duel were \"absolutely inadmissible\" on the French stage.<ref>[[#Pemble|Pemble, John (2005)]], p. 97.</ref> Dumas realized that Ducis' play was not the same as the original: Pierre Le Tourneur had published a relatively faithful prose translation, not intended for performance, in 1779. Nevertheless, moral propriety and ''politesse'' dictated that only such highly sanitized versions as that of Ducis could be performed on stage. The French referred to these performing editions as ''imitations'', and most knew that they were highly modified versions of the original. All the same, Ducis was at first accused of polluting French theaters with Shakespeare; only much later was he indicted for mutilating the original.<ref>[[#Pemble|Pemble, John (2005)]], p. 98.</ref>\n\nDumas could not speak or read English well. He needed help, so he selected a younger writer by the name of [[Paul Meurice]] from among his coterie of prot\u00e9g\u00e9s and assistants. Meurice had earlier collaborated with [[Auguste Vacquerie]] on ''Falstaff'', a combination of [[Henry IV, Part 1|Parts I]] and [[Henry IV, Part 2|II of Shakespeare's ''Henry IV'']], which had been presented at the Od\u00e9on in 1842. The Dumas-Meurice ''Hamlet'' was performed at Dumas' Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Historique in 1847 and had an enormous success. (With some alterations the Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise took it into repertory in 1886, and it continued to be performed in France until the middle of the 20th century.)<ref name=Fauser/><ref>[[#Pemble|Pemble, John (2005)]], p. 109.</ref>\n\nThe Dumas-Meurice version was more faithful to Shakespeare and restored much of what was missing from the Ducis version, including Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, the ghost, the duel, and the gravediggers. Still, by modern standards, it was a rather free adaptation of the original. Fortinbras was dropped, and the entire opening scene with the sentinels on the ramparts of the castle was excised. A love scene between Hamlet and Ophelia was added to the first act. Claudius does not send Hamlet to England, so Rosencrantz and Guildenstern do not die. Notably, at the end of the play, as Gertrude, Claudius, and Laertes are dying, the ghost of Hamlet's father reappears and condemns each of the dying characters. To Claudius it says: ''D\u00e9sesp\u00e8re et meurs!'' &ndash; \"Despair and die!\"; to Laertes: ''Prie et meurs!'' &ndash; \"Pray and die!\"; and to the Queen: ''Esp\u00e8re et meure!'' &ndash; \"Hope and die!\". When the wounded Hamlet asks: ''Et quel ch\u00e2timent m'attend donc?'' &ndash; \"And what punishment awaits me?\", the ghost responds: ''Tu vivras!'' &ndash; \"You shall live!\", and the curtain falls.<ref name=Fauser/><ref>[[#Pemble|Pemble, John (2005)]], pp. 109\u2013111.</ref>\n\nDumas explained these \"improvements\" to Shakespeare's play by insisting that the original violated plausibility, transgressed decency, and destroyed the dramatic balance. \"Since Hamlet is not guilty to the same degree as the others, he should not die the same death as the others.\" Four dead bodies would constitute \"the most unpleasant effect.\" Since the ghost appears at the beginning of the play, \"it must necessarily reappear to be present at the end.\"<ref>[[#Pemble|Pemble, John (2005)]], p. 111.</ref>\n\n==Preparation of the libretto==\nThe librettists for the opera of ''Hamlet'', Michel Carr\u00e9 and Jules Barbier, were experienced: they had already provided librettos for Thomas' ''Mignon'' and also for Gounod's ''Faust''.<ref name=Forbes21>[[Elizabeth Forbes (musicologist)|Forbes, Elizabeth]], \"Hamlet\" in [[#HamletCD1993|''Hamlet'' CD Booklet (1993)]], p. 21.</ref> They chose Dumas' version of the play as the basis for their libretto. This was the version with which French audiences of the day were most familiar, and the one against which the opera would be compared and judged.<ref name=Fauser/>\n\nWhen adapting a play for opera, it was imperative to shorten and simplify. Traditionally [[grand opera]] conveys plot in broad brushstrokes; the audience is not particularly interested in its intricacies, or its detours and complexities.<ref>White, Nicholas (2003). \"Fictions and librettos\" in Charlton, David, ed. ''[[Cambridge Companions to Music|The Cambridge Companion to Grand Opera]]'', p. 45. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-521-64683-3}}.</ref> An uncut version of Shakespeare's play had more than 30 characters and could run for over four hours. The libretto reduced the total number of characters to fifteen (counting the four mime players required for the Play scene), and also reduced the number of subplots. Dumas had cut the scene with the sentinels Bernardo and Francisco. Gone also were Voltimand, Cornelius, Osric, and Reynaldo. Like Dumas, Fortinbras was omitted, thus there was no need to mention an invasion from Norway. Dumas omitted the subplot of Hamlet's voyage to England, so Rosencrantz and Guildenstern were also omitted, removing most of the black humor of the play. Polonius' accidental murder in act 4 was excised, and his singing part reduced to only eight measures.<ref name=Fauser/><ref name=Forbes21/><ref name=Salter>Salter, Lionel (1994). [http://www.gramophone.net/Issue/Page/January%201994/99 Review of the recording of ''Hamlet'' with Thomas Hampson]. ''Gramophone'', January 1994.</ref>\n\nThis simplification of characters and subplots focused the drama on Hamlet's predicament and its effects on Oph\u00e9lie and left the opera with essentially 4 main characters: Hamlet and Oph\u00e9lie, Claudius and Gertrude. This constellation of roles preserved the tetradic model and the balance of male and female parts which had become established in French grand opera at the time of Meyerbeer's ''[[Robert le diable]]'' in 1831. The libretto originally specified for these roles one soprano (Oph\u00e9lie), one mezzo-soprano (Gertrude), one tenor (Hamlet), and one baritone or bass (Claudius).<ref name=Fauser/>\n\nOther plot changes, such as making L\u00e4erte less cynical and more positive towards Hamlet early on,<ref name=Gurewitsch/> not only simplified the story but heightened the tragedy of their duel in the Gravediggers Scene. Making Gertrude a co-conspirator alongside Claudius, enhanced the dramatic conflict between Hamlet and Gertrude when Hamlet attempts to coerce a confession from her in the Closet Scene. Making Polonius a co-conspirator, as revealed in the Closet Scene, strengthened Hamlet's motivation in rejecting his marriage to Oph\u00e9lie. This crucial change facilitated the transformation of Shakespeare's Ophelia into the opera's Oph\u00e9lie, a creature who dramatically is almost entirely drawn from the 19th-century, whose madness stems not from the actions of a man who creates an intolerable situation, but rather from a man whose withdrawal leaves an emptiness she is unable to fill. Musically, of course, the Mad Scene was one of those audience-pleasing creations which drew upon well-established operatic tradition.<ref name=Fauser/><ref name=Forbes24>Forbes, Elizabeth, \"Hamlet\" in [[#HamletCD1993|''Hamlet'' CD Booklet (1993)]], p. 24.</ref>\n\nAnother change, the addition of Hamlet's drinking song for the Players in act 2, created another opportunity for an audience-pleasing musical number. It also led to a shortening of his instructions to them before the song<ref name=Forbes21/> and could be justified dramatically as a cover for his ulterior motive in asking them to enact the mime play.<ref name=Tubeuf/> In the final scene, in another simplification of the plot, La\u00ebrte, Polonius, and Gertrude survive. As in the Dumas' play, the ghost returns at the end, but unlike in Dumas, the ghost merely banishes Gertrude to a convent for her role in the conspiracy. Finally, exactly as in Dumas, Hamlet lives and is proclaimed King.<ref name=Tubeuf>[[Andr\u00e9 Tubeuf|Tubeuf, Andr\u00e9]]; Corbier, Annie, trans. \"Synopsis\" in [[#HamletCD1993|''Hamlet'' CD Booklet (1993)]], pp. 30&ndash;32.</ref>\n\n==Composition==\n[[File:Hamlet (opera) by Thomas, Cover of Piano-Vocal Score.jpg|thumb|Cover of the piano-vocal score of Thomas' ''Hamlet'' (1868)]]\nVery little is known concerning the details of the composition of the music. Thomas may have received the libretto around 1859. The original libretto was in four acts, but the requirements of the authorities at that time specified the premiere at the [[Paris Op\u00e9ra]] of at least one 5-act opera per season.<ref name=Fauser/> The inclusion of a ballet was also obligatory.<ref name=Forbes611/> The fourth and final act, which included the Mad Scene and the Gravediggers Scene, was simply split into two. To confer more weight to the new fourth act, the ballet was added between the choral introduction of the Mad Scene and Oph\u00e9lie's recitative and aria.<ref name=Fauser/>\n\nIn 1863 the director of the Op\u00e9ra, [[\u00c9mile Perrin]], wrote in a letter to a minister of state that Thomas had nearly finished writing the music. Later the press conjectured as to the reason for the delay of the opera, suggesting that Thomas had yet to find his ideal Oph\u00e9lie.<ref name=Fauser/> Thomas' opera ''[[Mignon]]'' (1866), an adaptation of Goethe's novel ''[[Wilhelm Meisters Lehrjahre]]'', had been the composer's very effective response to Gounod's earlier Goethe adaption, the opera [[Faust (opera)|''Faust'']], which had premiered in 1859. ''Mignon'' had been performed at the [[Op\u00e9ra-Comique]], and Thomas was under pressure to provide a similar success at the Op\u00e9ra, in particular as several of his earlier productions there had done poorly.<ref name=Forbes726>[[Elizabeth Forbes (musicologist)|Forbes, Elizabeth]], \"Thomas, (Charles Louis) Ambroise\" in [[#NewGroveOpera|Sadie (1992)]] '''4''': 726-727.</ref>\n\nWhen Gounod's Shakespeare adaptation, the opera ''[[Rom\u00e9o et Juliette]]'', appeared at the [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Lyrique]] in 1867, it provided additional impetus for Thomas to finish working on his own adaptation of ''Hamlet''.<ref>Forbes, Elizabeth, \"Hamlet\" in [[#HamletCD1993|''Hamlet'' CD Booklet (1993)]], pp. 20&ndash;21.</ref> According to accounts in the press, it was that same year, at his publisher [[Heugel (music publisher)|Heugel]]'s office in Paris, that Thomas met the Swedish soprano [[Christine Nilsson]], who had just been engaged at the Op\u00e9ra. Thomas finally consented to the scheduling of the premiere. Consistent with this press report, parts of the soprano role were altered around this time with Nilsson's capabilities in mind. Thomas replaced a dialog with the women's chorus in the Mad Scene in act 4 with a Swedish Ballade.<ref name=Fauser/> This Ballade resembles the first movement of [[Grieg]]'s Op. 63 (''Two Nordic Melodies''), and its use was suggested to Thomas by Nilsson.<ref name=Salter />\n\nA tenor suitable for the role of Hamlet could not be found, but an outstanding dramatic baritone, [[Jean-Baptiste Faure]], was available, so Thomas decided to transpose the part, originally written for a tenor, to baritone.

Claudius places the crown on Gertrude's head. All leave, and Prince Hamlet, son of the late King and Gertrude, enters. He is upset that his mother has remarried so soon. Oph\u00e9lie enters, and they sing a love duet. La\u00ebrte, Oph\u00e9lie's brother, enters. He is being sent to Norway and gives his farewells. He entrusts Oph\u00e9lie to the care of Hamlet. Hamlet refuses to join La\u00ebrte and Oph\u00e9lie as they leave to join the banquet, and goes off in another direction. Courtiers and soldiers, on their way to the banquet, enter the hall. Horatio and Marcellus tell the soldiers that they have seen the ghost of Hamlet's father on the ramparts of the castle the previous night and go off to tell Hamlet.\n\n''Scene 2: The Ramparts''\n\nHoratio and Marcellus meet Hamlet on the ramparts. The Ghost appears, Horatio and Marcellus leave, and the Ghost tells his son that Claudius murdered him with poison. The Ghost commands Hamlet to take vengeance on Claudius, but Gertrude must be spared. The Ghost withdraws. Hamlet draws his sword and swears to avenge his father.\n\n[[File:Christine Nilsson as Ophelia NGO2-607.jpg|thumb|[[Christina Nilsson|Christine Nilsson]] as Oph\u00e9lie]]\n\n===Act 2===\n''Scene 1: The Gardens''\n\nOph\u00e9lie, reading a book, is concerned at Hamlet's new indifference. Hamlet appears in the distance, but leaves without speaking. The Queen enters. Oph\u00e9lie says she would like to leave the court, but the Queen insists she should stay. Oph\u00e9lie leaves the garden and King Claudius enters. Gertrude suspects that Hamlet now knows about the murder of his father, but Claudius says he does not. Hamlet enters and feigns madness. He rejects all overtures of friendship from Claudius, then announces he has engaged a troupe of actors to perform a play that evening. Claudius and Gertrude leave, and the players enter. Hamlet asks them to mime the play ''The Murder of Gonzago'' and then sings a drinking song, playing the fool, so as not to arouse suspicion.\n\n''Scene 2: The Play''\n\nThe King and Queen and the other guests assemble in the castle hall where the stage has been set up. The play begins, and Hamlet narrates. The play tells a story similar to the murder of Hamlet's father. After the \"poison\" is administered, the \"assassin\" places the \"crown\" on his head. Claudius turns pale, rises abruptly, and commands the play to stop and the actors to leave. Hamlet accuses Claudius of the murder of his father, and snatches Claudius' crown from his head. The entire assembly reacts in a grand septet with chorus.\n\n===Act 3===\n''Closet Scene''\n\nIn the Queen's chambers Hamlet delivers the monologue \"To be or not to be\", then hides behind a tapestry. Claudius enters and prays aloud of his remorse. Hamlet, deciding Claudius' soul may be saved, if he is killed while praying, delays yet again. Polonius enters and in his conversation with Claudius reveals his own complicity. The King and Polonius leave, Hamlet emerges, and Gertrude enters with Oph\u00e9lie. The Queen tries to persuade Hamlet to marry Oph\u00e9lie, but Hamlet, realizing he can no longer marry the daughter of the guilty Polonius, refuses. Oph\u00e9lie returns her ring to Hamlet and leaves. Hamlet tries to force Gertrude to confront her guilt, but she resists. As Hamlet threatens her, he sees the Ghost, who reminds him he must spare his mother.\n\n===Act 4===\n''The Mad Scene''\n\nAfter Hamlet's rejection, Oph\u00e9lie has gone mad and drowns herself in the lake.\n\n===Act 5===\n''Gravediggers Scene''\n\nHamlet comes upon two gravediggers digging a new grave. He asks who has died, but they do not know. He sings of remorse for his ill treatment of Oph\u00e9lie. La\u00ebrte, who has returned from Norway and learned of his sister's death and Hamlet's role in it, enters and challenges Hamlet to a duel. They fight, and Hamlet is wounded, but Oph\u00e9lie's funeral procession interrupts the duel. Hamlet finally realizes she is dead. The Ghost appears again and exhorts Hamlet to kill Claudius, which Hamlet does, avenging his father's death. The Ghost affirms Claudius' guilt and Hamlet's innocence. Hamlet, still in despair, is proclaimed King to cries of \"Long live Hamlet! Long live the King!\".\n\n:[In the much shorter \"Covent Garden\" ending the ghost does not appear, and, after Hamlet finally attacks and kills Claudius, he embraces Oph\u00e9lie's body and dies.

Introduction, march and chorus.''' The court celebrates the Coronation of Gertrude, widow of King Hamlet; and her marriage to his brother, Claudius (Courtiers: ''Que nos chants montent jusqu'aux cieux'' &ndash; \"Let our songs rise to the skies\"). The new king, Claudius, stands before his throne on a dais, surrounded by the nobles of the court. His court chancellor, Polonius, is nearby. Queen Gertrude enters, approaches the dais, and bows to the King (Courtiers: ''Salut, \u00f4 Reine bien-aim\u00e9e!'' &ndash; \"Greetings, O beloved Queen!\"). Polonius hands the King a crown, which he takes and places on her head (The King: ''\u00d4 toi, qui fus la femme de mon fr\u00e8re'' &ndash; \"O you who were my brother's wife\"). Gertrude comments in an [[aside]] to Claudius that she does not see her son Hamlet. Claudius admonishes her to bear herself as a queen. The courtiers sing of their joy as they celebrate the King and Queen's glorious marriage (Courtiers: ''Le deuil fait place aux chants joyeux'' &ndash; \"Mourning gives way to joyful songs\"). The King and Queen leave the hall followed by the courtiers.\n\n'''2. Recitative and duet.''' Prince Hamlet, son of the late King and Gertrude, enters the empty hall. As Hamlet enters, before he begins singing, the low strings in the orchestra play '''Hamlet's Theme''':<ref name=\"Fauser\"/>\n{| align=\"center\"\n|-\n|[[File:Hamlet's Theme - Ambroise Thomas (piano-vocal score p24).jpg|thumb|500px|Hamlet's Theme from act 1.

Tendresse \u00e9ph\u00e9m\u00e8re!'' &ndash; \"Futile regrets! Ephemeral tenderness!\").\n\nOph\u00e9lie enters. Her entrance is accompanied by '''Oph\u00e9lie's Theme'''. According to the German musicologist Annegret Fauser, Oph\u00e9lie's music contrasts with Hamlet's very regular 8-bar phrase: the 4-bar theme accentuates her nervous character by the use of dotted-note rhythms, a chromatic melody line, and high-range woodwind instruments. The excerpt below ends with 3 bars of florid solo flute music which foreshadows Oph\u00e9lie's [[coloratura]] singing later in the opera.<ref name=Fauser/>\n{| align=\"center\"\n|-\n|[[File:Ophelia's Theme - Hamlet - Ambroise Thomas (piano-vocal score pp26-27).jpg|thumbnail|500px|Oph\u00e9lie's Theme from act 1 (first 4 bars).

Hamlet protests he cannot make promises of love one day, only to forget them the next. His heart is not that of a woman. Oph\u00e9lie is distraught at the insult, and Hamlet begs forgiveness.\n\nThe '''duet''' affirms their love (Hamlet, Oph\u00e9lie: ''Doute de la lumi\u00e8re'' &ndash; \"Doubt that the light\"). The text of the duet is based on Shakespeare's \"Doubt thou the stars are fire\", which is part of a letter from Hamlet to Ophelia which Polonius reads to Gertrude and Claudius. The melody of the vocal line in Hamlet's first phrases has been called the '''Theme of Hamlet's Love for Oph\u00e9lie''' and appears several more times in the opera, with particular poignancy near the end of the Mad Scene (see [[#Mad Scene|below]]).<ref name=Fauser/>\n{| align=\"center\"\n|-\n|[[File:Theme of Hamlet's Love for Ophelia - Ambroise Thomas (piano-vocal score p30).jpg|thumbnail|500px|Theme of Hamlet's Love for Ophelia from act 1.

They reoccur, usually in modified form, whenever significant situations relevant to the ideas they represent present themselves, although without having, in the Wagnerian sense, a [[leitmotiv]]ic function.<ref name=Fauser/>\n\n'''3. Recitative and cavatina of La\u00ebrte.''' Oph\u00e9lie's brother, La\u00ebrte, enters. He tells Hamlet and Oph\u00e9lie that the King is sending him to the court of Norway, and he must leave that very night (unlike in the play where, as Matthew Gurewitsch of ''[[Opera News]]'' has said, he embarks for \"the fleshpots of Paris\").<ref name=Gurewitsch>Gurewitsch, Matthew (March 2010).

(In the play Laertes warns Ophelia to be wary of Hamlet's intentions.) Fanfares are heard as servants and pages pass at the back. La\u00ebrte asks Hamlet and Oph\u00e9lie to come with him to the banquet, but Hamlet declines. The couple separates, as La\u00ebrte and Oph\u00e9lie leave for the banquet, and Hamlet goes off in the other direction. More fanfares are heard as lords and ladies enter on their way to the banquet (Lords and Ladies: ''Honneur, honneur au Roi!'' &ndash; \"Honor, honor to the King!\"). They are followed by a group of young officers.\n\n'''4. Chorus of Officers and Pages.''' The officers sing of their hope that the call of pleasure will dispel their current ennui (Officers: ''Nargue de la tristesse!'' &ndash; \"Scoff at sorrow\"). Horatio and Marcellus enter in haste, looking for Hamlet. They tell of having seen the ghost of the late King upon the ramparts the previous night. The skeptical officers respond: \"An absurd illusion! Lies and sorcery!\" Undeterred, Horatio and Marcellus leave to find and warn the young prince. The officers, with the lords and ladies, finish the chorus and depart for the banquet. (Again, this scene is unlike the play in which Horatio, who has not seen the ghost himself but has merely heard of it from the sentinels, reports the news of the ghost's appearance to Hamlet directly, and not to a group of soldiers. For some reason Matthew Gurewitsch finds this change somewhat odd: \"Horatio and a sidekick blab the dread news of the Ghost's appearance to a squadron of frolicking young officers, who are totally unimpressed.\")<ref name=Gurewitsch/>\n\n'''<big>Scene 2</big>'''\n\n''The ramparts.

The five-minute prelude sets the sinister atmosphere of the scene.\n\n'''5. Scene at the ramparts.''' Horatio and Marcellus enter (Horatio: ''Viendra-t-il?'' &ndash; \"Will he come?\") and are soon followed by Hamlet (Hamlet: ''Horatio! n'est-ce point vous?'' &ndash; \"Horatio! is that you?\"). Horatio and Marcellus tell Hamlet that they have seen his father's ghost on the previous night at the stroke of twelve. Fanfares are heard emanating from the banquet hall within the castle, and soon thereafter the bells begin to toll midnight. The ghost appears, and they express their fear.\n\n'''Invocation.''' Hamlet addresses the Ghost (Hamlet: ''Spectre infernal! Image vener\u00e9e!'' &ndash; \"Infernal apparition! Venerated image!\"). The ghost gives a sign indicating that Horatio and Marcellus should withdraw, and Hamlet orders them to do so. The ghost speaks: ''\u00c9coute-moi!'' &ndash; \"Listen to me!\". He identifies himself and commands Hamlet to avenge him. Hamlet asks what is the crime he must avenge, and who has committed it? Sounds of music from within the castle, fanfares, and distant cannon are heard, and the Ghost responds: \"Hark: it is he they are honoring, he who they have proclaimed King! ... The adulterer has defiled my royal residence: and he, to make his treason more complete, spying upon my sleep and taking advantage of the hour, poured poison on my sleeping lips. ... Avenge me, my son! Avenge your father! ... From your mother, though, turn your anger away, we must leave punishment in the care of heaven.\" The ghost withdraws, his parting words: ''Souviens-toi!'' &ndash; \"Remember me!\" Hamlet draws his sword and proclaims his intention to obey the ghost's command (Hamlet: ''Ombre ch\u00e9re, ombre vengeresse, j'exaucerai ton v\u0153u! ... je me souviendrai!'' &ndash; \"Beloved shade, avenging shade, I shall fulfill your command! ... I shall remember!\").

The second act begins with a musical interlude of about two minutes, which sets the scene in the garden. After some emphatic introductory orchestral chords and horn calls, harp arpeggios lead into the main section which employs the '''Theme of Hamlet's Love''',<ref name=Fauser/> initially played by horn and strings, followed by solo horn accompanied with clarinet and flute figures reminiscent of bird calls.<ref>[[#Scores|Piano-vocal score]], pp. 85&ndash;86; [[#Videos|DVD with Simon Keenlyside as Hamlet]], Disc 1, Chapter 10 (48:23&ndash;50:20).</ref>\n\n'''<big>Scene 1</big>'''\n\n''The castle gardens'' (set designed by [[Charles-Antoine Cambon]])''.''\n\n'''6. Aria of Oph\u00e9lie.''' Oph\u00e9lie is in the garden with a book in her hand. She laments Hamlet's distance, feeling his look is something like reproach (Oph\u00e9lie: ''Sa main depuis hier n'a pas touch\u00e9 ma main!'' &ndash; \"His hand has not touched mine since yesterday\"). She reads from her book, at first silently, then aloud (Oph\u00e9lie: ''\"Adieu, dit-il, ayez-foi!\"'' &ndash; \"'Adieu, he said, trust me!'\"). Hamlet appears on the other side of the garden. (An [[English horn]] plays the '''Theme of Hamlet's Love'''.) Hamlet sees Oph\u00e9lie and tarries. Again she reads aloud from her book (Oph\u00e9lie: ''\"En vous, cruel, j'avais foi! Je vous aimais, aimez moi!\"'' &ndash; \"'In you, O cruel one, I believed. I loved you! Love me too!'\"), then looks at Hamlet. However, he remains silent, then rushes away. Oph\u00e9lie says ruefully: ''Ah! ce livre a dit vrai!'' &ndash; \"Ah! This book spoke the truth!\" and continues her aria (Oph\u00e9lie: ''Les serments on des ailes!'' &ndash; \"Promises have wings!\").\n\n'''7. Recitative and arioso.''' The Queen comes into the garden hoping to find Hamlet. She sees Oph\u00e9lie's distress and presses her for information as to its cause (The Queen: ''Je croyais pr\u00e8s de vous trouver mon fils'' &ndash; \"I thought to find my son with you\"). Oph\u00e9lie says Hamlet no longer loves her and begs permission to leave the court. In the Queen's arioso, one of the finest numbers in the score,<ref name=Forbes22/> she rejects Oph\u00e9lie's request, saying that the barrier between Oph\u00e9lie and Hamlet comes from another source (The Queen: ''Dans sons regards plus sombre'' &ndash; \"In his sombre expression\"). She argues that Oph\u00e9lie's presence may help cure Hamlet of his madness. Oph\u00e9lie says she shall obey and leaves.\n\n'''8. Duet.''' The King now comes into the garden (The King: ''L'\u00e2me de votre fils est \u00e0 jamais troubl\u00e9e, Madame'' &ndash; \"Your son's soul is ever troubled, Madame\"). The Queen suggests Hamlet may have discovered the truth, but Claudius believes he suspects nothing.\n\nAn extended version of this very short duet appears in the piano-vocal score.<ref>[[#PianoVocalScore|Thomas, Ambroise (1868)]], pp. 107&ndash;117.</ref> Only the initial phrases of this passage are found in the original full score, and the section which begins with the Queen's phrase ''H\u00e9las! Dieu m'\u00e9pargne la honte'' &ndash; \"Alas! may God spare me the shame\" is marked as a possible cut. The scoring of the remainder of the duet was thought lost. The original manuscript with the full score of the duet was recently found at the [[Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France]] in Paris.<ref name=Forbes22/> The uncut duet is performed in the video recording with [[Simon Keenlyside]] as Hamlet.<ref>[[#Videos|DVD with Simon Keenlyside as Hamlet]], Disc 1, Chapter 13 (1:04:17&ndash;1:08:48).</ref> It is included as an appendix in the recording with [[Thomas Hampson]] as Hamlet (see [[#Recordings|Recordings]]).<ref name=Forbes22/>\n\n'''Recitative.''' At the conclusion of the duet Hamlet enters, and the orchestra plays '''Hamlet's Theme'''.<ref>[[#PianoVocalScore|Thomas, Ambroise (1868)]], pp. 118&ndash;120.</ref> When the 8-bar theme has concluded, the King calls to Hamlet (The King: ''Cher Hamlet'' &ndash; \"Dear Hamlet\"), and Hamlet responds \"Sire!\". Claudius asks Hamlet to refer to him as Father, but Hamlet responds that his father is dead. Claudius offers his hand, in Hamlet's father's name. There is a pause as the orchestra begins again to play Hamlet's Theme, and Hamlet responds: \"His is cold and lifeless.\" When the theme has finished, Claudius calls Hamlet \"My son...\", but Hamlet angrily responds: \"My name is Hamlet!\", and starts to walk away. The orchestra begins Hamlet's Theme again, and Gertrude asks whether Hamlet seeks the young and beautiful Oph\u00e9lie, but Hamlet responds that youth and beauty will vanish in a single day. When the orchestra has finished playing Hamlet's Theme, Claudius suggests that Hamlet may wish to travel abroad, to France and Italy, but Hamlet responds he'd rather travel, like the clouds, among the stars, amid bolts of lightning.\n\nThere is a distant sound of festive music. The theme employed is that of the Danish March (which accompanies the entrance of the royal court in the following Play Scene).<ref>[[#PianoVocalScore|Thomas, Ambroise (1868)]], p. 122.</ref> The King tells Hamlet to listen to the sound of the festivities and admonishes him to hold up his head. Hamlet announces he has summoned an itinerant troupe of actors to provide entertainment. Claudius agrees to this, and then says to Gertrude, \"He knows nothing!\", but she replies \"I am afraid!\" as they turn to leave. The orchestra begins to play the theme of '''Hamlet's Promise''', and Hamlet sings: ''Mon p\u00e9re! Patience! Patience!'' &ndash; \"My father! Patience! Patience!\".<ref>[[#PianoVocalScore|Thomas, Ambroise (1868)]], p. 124.</ref>\n\n'''9. Recitative and chorus of comedians.''' Marcellus and Horatio enter with the Players (tenors and basses). Marcellus announces: ''Voici les histrions mand\u00e9s par vous, Seigneur.'' &ndash; \"Here are the actors you sent for, my lord.\" The players sing a chorus (Players: ''Princes sans apanages'' &ndash; \"Princes without privilege\").<ref>This chorus is omitted in the video recording with Simon Keenlyside as Hamlet. See [[#Videos|DVD with Simon Keenlyside as Hamlet]], Disc 1, Chapter 13 (1:14:21).</ref> In an aside Hamlet reveals his true purpose (Hamlet: ''C'est en croyant revoir se dresser sa victime que plus d'un meurtrier a confess\u00e9 son crime'' &ndash; \"In believing he sees his victim rise up, more than one murderer has confessed his crime\"). He asks the players to enact the play ''The Murder of Gonzago'', saying he shall tell them when to pour the poison. He then asks the pages to bring in wine for all.\n\n'''10. ''Chanson Bacchique''.''' Seizing a goblet, Hamlet sings a song in praise of wine (Hamlet: ''\u00d4 vin, dissipe la tristesse qui p\u00e9se sur mon c\u0153ur! \u00c0 moi les r\u00eaves de l'ivresse et le rire moqueur!'' &ndash; \"O wine, dispel the sorrow which weighs on my heart! Give me dreams of euphoria and the mocking laugh!\"). In a florid [[cadenza]] it rises to a high G ([[Scientific pitch notation|G4]]). (An easier version with fewer notes and a lower top note, F ([[Scientific pitch notation|F4]]), is also included in the score.)<ref>[[#PianoVocalScore|Thomas, Ambroise (1868)]], p. 136.</ref> This drinking song, which is not found in Shakespeare, has been the object of much negative criticism. [[Edward Greenfield]], on the other hand, has written that \"Thomas brings off a superb dramatic coup with the most memorable of the hero's solos, his drinking song for the players....\"<ref name=Greenfield>Greenfield, Edward (1984). \"Thomas. Hamlet.\" (Review of the recording with [[Joan Sutherland]]), ''Gramophone'' July 1984, p. 152.

The royal throne is on the right, a platform for the courtiers on the left; at the back, a small theatre, curtains closed'' (set by [[Charles-Antoine Cambon]])''.''\n\n'''11. Danish march.''' The entrance of the royal court is accompanied by a four-and-a-half minute [[March (music)|march]] in ''[[alla breve]]'' time and [[Ternary form|A-B-A form]] which is introduced with a fanfare. The theme of the A section was first heard near the end of the trio recitative with Claudius, Hamlet, and Gertrude in the first scene of act 2. The King and Queen enter first, followed by Polonius, Oph\u00e9lie, Hamlet, Horatio, Marcellus, and the court.<ref>In the video recording with Simon Keenlyside this scenic transformation occurs with the curtain up. A long banquet table is rolled from the wings at the conclusion of the ''Chanson Bacchique'' as the orchestra finishes playing. Hamlet remains on stage, and after the applause, a truncated version of the march (fanfare and first A section, just under one minute) is heard as Oph\u00e9lie, on the arm of her father Polonius, and Horatio, Marcellus, and the courtiers arrive. The King and Queen arrive last. ([[#Videos|DVD with Simon Keenlyside as Hamlet]], Disc 1, Chapter (1:04:17&ndash;1:08:48).</ref>\n\n'''Recitative and prologue.''' Hamlet asks Oph\u00e9lie if he may sit at her feet (Hamlet: ''Belle, permettez-nous'' &ndash; \"Lady, permit me\"). She responds that his expression frightens and chills her. Hamlet sits, his eyes fixed on the King and Queen. Everyone takes their places, and the curtains of the small theatre are opened. The play is introduced with a short orchestral passage featuring a [[saxophone]] solo. (According to Annegret Fauser this is the first instance of the use of a saxophone in an opera.)<ref>Fauser (1993), p.</ref> In an aside Hamlet asks Marcellus to watch the King (Hamlet: ''Voici l'instant! fixez vos regards sur le Roi, et, si vous le voyez p\u00e2lir, dites-le moi!'' &ndash; \"Now! Fix your gaze on upon the King, and, if he should turn pale, tell me!\").\n\n'''12. Pantomime and finale.''' On the small stage an aged king wearing a crown enters slowly on the arm of a queen whose features and costume are similar to those of Queen Gertrude. Hamlet, whose eyes never leave the face of King Claudius, narrates the action of the mimed play (Hamlet: ''C'est le vieux Roi Gonzague et la Reine Geni\u00e8vre'' &ndash; \"This is the aged King Gonzago and Queen Guinevere\"). The play proceeds as follows: With protestations of love Guinevere leads Gonzago to a lonely spot. The drowsy king soon falls asleep in her arms. The villain enters. She holds out a cup, he seizes it, and pours the fatal potion, then takes the crown and places it on his head.\n\nAt this point Hamlet interrupts his narrative and addresses Claudius directly (Hamlet: ''Sire, vous p\u00e2lissez'' &ndash; \"Sire, you grow pale!\"). Angered and fearful, the King rises (The King: ''Chassez, chassez d'ici ces vils histrions!'' &ndash; \"Expel, expel these vile minstrels!\"). Hamlet, feigning madness, accuses Claudius of the murder of his father (Hamlet: ''C'est lui qui versait le poison!'' &ndash; \"He's the one who poured the poison!\"). Hamlet approaches the King, pushing aside the courtiers who surround him, and snatches the crown from Claudius' head (Hamlet: ''A bas, masque menteur! vaine couronne, \u00e0 bas!'' &ndash; \"Down with the lying mask! Down with the empty crown!\").\n\nThe King, pulling himself together, solemnly declares: ''\u00d4 mortelle offense! Aveugle d\u00e9mence, qui glace tous les c\u0153urs d'effroi!'' &ndash; \"O fatal insult! Blind lunacy, which chills every heart with dread!\" The melody of the vocal line is a variant of the theme of '''Hamlet's Promise'''. Oph\u00e9lie cries out, and the Queen declares her outrage (The Queen: ''Dans sa folle rage, il brave, il outrage'' &ndash; \"In his mad rage, he defies, he offends\"). These utterances of the King and the Queen begin a grand ensemble passage, \"a magnificent septet\",<ref name=Forbes611>Forbes, Elizabeth, \"Hamlet\" in [[#NewGroveOpera|Sadie (1992)]] '''2''': 611.</ref> which builds to a climax in which Hamlet bursts out in \"mad Berlioz-like excitement\"<ref name=Greenfield/> with snatches of the '''''Chanson Bacchique'''''. At the end, Hamlet totally collapses. The King rushes out, followed by the Queen, and the entire court.\n\n===Act 3===\n'''<big>\"Closet Scene\"</big>'''\n\n''A chamber in the Queen's apartments. At the back are two full-length portraits of the two kings. A [[prie-Dieu]]. A lamp burns on a table'' (set by [[\u00c9douard Desplechin]])''.''\n\n'''Entr'acte.''' The act begins with a short but powerful introduction, \"almost Verdian\"<ref name=Salter /> in its effect. Fortissimo French horns play the variant of '''Hamlet's Promise''' (the King's ''\u00d4 mortelle offense!'') which began the septet that closed act 2. The music becomes more agitated, reflecting Hamlet's highly conflicted state of mind. The trumpets sound mutated snippets of the royal court's Danish march.<ref name=Fauser />\n\n'''13. Monologue.''' Hamlet is alone and seated on a couch. He chastises himself for his failure to act (Hamlet: ''J'ai pu frapper le mis\u00e9rable'' &ndash; \"I could have killed the scoundrel.\") This leads to a calmer, more introspective section (Hamlet: ''\u00catre ou ne pas \u00eatre'' &ndash; \"To be or not to be\"), which follows the Shakespeare original closely, although greatly shortened.<ref name=Gurewitsch/><ref name=\"Forbes24\"/> He hears someone approaching (Hamlet: ''Mais qui donc ose ici me suivre? Le Roi!...'' &ndash; \"But who then dares to follow me here? The King!...\"). He hides behind a tapestry (arras).\n\n'''14. Recitative and bass aria.''' The King enters. He muses to himself (The King: ''C'est en vain que j'ai cru me soustraire aux remords.'' &ndash; \"In vain have I thought to escape my remorse.\"). The King kneels at the prie-Dieu and prays aloud (The King: ''Je t'implore, \u00f4 mon fr\u00e8re!'' &ndash; \"I implore you, O my brother!\"). Hamlet overhears and fears Claudius' remorse could yet save his soul. He therefore delays yet again, deciding that Claudius must be dispatched in drunken revels at the court. The King rises. Thinking he has seen a ghost, he calls out for Polonius. Polonius comes rushing in. The King tells him he has seen the ghost of the dead king. Polonius tries to calm the King and warns him to beware lest a word betray them both. The King rushes out followed by Polonius. Hamlet emerges from behind the tapestry (Hamlet: ''Polonius est son complice! le p\u00e8re d'Oph\u00e9lie!'' &ndash; \"Polonius is his accomplice. Ophelia's father!\"). He regrets having overheard this terrible revelation.\n\n[[File:Nellie Melba as Ophelia in Hamlet (opera) - Henri Gervex ON2010-03-12.jpg|thumb|[[Nellie Melba]] as Oph\u00e9lie, by [[Henri Gervex]]]]\n'''15. Trio.''' Oph\u00e9lie enters with the Queen. (The Queen: ''Le voil\u00e0! Je veux lire enfin dans sa pens\u00e9e'' &ndash; \"There he is! I must know what is on his mind\"). The Queen tells Hamlet, the altar awaits him, here is his betrothed. Hamlet looks away, without replying. The Queen persists. Hamlet thinks of Polonius' perfidy (Hamlet: ''Sur moi tombent les cieux avant que cet hymen funeste s'accomplisse!'' &ndash; \"May the heavens fall upon me before such an ill-fated marriage can be solemnized!\"). Oph\u00e9lie asks what he means. He responds: ''Non! Allez dans un clo\u00eetre, allez, Oph\u00e9lie.'' &ndash; \"No! Go to a nunnery, go, Oph\u00e9lie.\"). The Queen asks whether he has forgotten all Oph\u00e9lie's virtues. He replies he now feels nothing in his heart. Oph\u00e9lie despairs (Oph\u00e9lie: ''Cet amor promis \u00e0 genoux'' &ndash; \"The love that on your knees you swore\"). She returns her ring to him ('''Theme of Hamlet's Love'''), and Hamlet weeps. The Queen turns to Oph\u00e9lie saying he weeps, he remembers, he loves you. Hamlet cries out again (Hamlet: ''Non! Allez dans un clo\u00eetre, allez, Oph\u00e9lie'' &ndash; \"No! Go to a nunnery, go, Oph\u00e9lie\"). Each continues to express conflicting feelings in an extended ensemble. Oph\u00e9lie leaves, hiding her tears.\n\n'''16. Duet.''' The Queen warns Hamlet that he has offended his father, and she may be powerless to save his life (The Queen: ''Hamlet, ma douleur est immense!'' &ndash; \"Hamlet, my grief is great!\"). Hamlet asks, who has offended his father? She denies any understanding of his meaning. Hamlet blocks her attempt to leave, tries to force her to confront her guilt (Hamlet: ''Ah! que votre \u00e2me sans refuge pleure sur les devoirs trahis'' &ndash; \"Ah! Let your defenseless heart weep over duties betrayed\"). Hamlet leads his mother to the two portraits and points to the portrait of his father (Hamlet: ''Ici la gr\u00e2ce et la beaut\u00e9 sereines'' &ndash; \"Here are grace and serene beauty\"), then to the other portrait (''L\u00e0, tous les crimes de la terre!'' &ndash; \"There, all crimes of the earth!\"). The Queen begs for mercy, kneeling before Hamlet (The Queen: ''Pardonne, h\u00e9las! ta voix m'accable!'' &ndash; Forgive me, alas! Your voice devastates me!\"). The Queen collapses on a couch. The orchestra repeats the distinctive [[ostinato]] first heard in the Ramparts Scene as the accompaniment to Hamlet's aria (''Spectre infernal!''). The light dims, and the Ghost appears behind the couch, one arm extended toward Hamlet (Ghost: ''Mon fils!'' &ndash; \"My son!\"). Hamlet pulls back in confusion. The Ghost warns Hamlet (Ghost: ''Souviens-toi... mais \u00e9pargne ta m\u00e8re!'' &ndash; \"Do not forget... but spare your mother!\"). As the Ghost vanishes, the orchestra plays the theme of '''Hamlet's Promise''', and the doors close themselves. Hamlet asks his mother not to think he is mad; his rage has calmed. He tells her to repent and sleep in peace, then leaves. She collapses at the foot of the prie-Dieu.\n\nElizabeth Forbes states that the final duet of act 3 represents the climax of the act and the pivotal scene of the entire opera,<ref name=Forbes24 /> and the act as a whole \"is by far the finest of the opera, musically as well as dramatically.\"<ref name=Forbes22 />\n\n===Act 4===\n''A pastoral spot surrounded by trees. At the back, a lake dotted with verdant islets and bordered with willows and rushes. The day breaks and floods the scene with cheerful light'' (set by [[\u00c9douard Desplechin]])''.''\n\n'''17. Entr'acte.''' A short musical interlude of about two minutes, which features a soft, [[legato]] clarinet solo, introduces the fourth act.\n\n'''Ballet:''' ''La F\u00eate du printemps (Celebration of Spring). Divertissement.''\n\n: '''A. Country dance.''' A party of young Danish peasants enters, and a spring country festival ensues (Peasants: ''Voici la riante saison'' \u2013 \"The fun season is here\").\n: '''B\u2013F.''' The ballet proper, which lasts about 18 minutes, consists of the following sections:\n:: B. Pas des chasseurs\n:: C. Pantomime\n:: D. Valse-Mazurka\n:: E. Sc\u00e8ne du bouquet \u2013 La Freya\n:: F. Strette finale\n\nThe recording conducted by [[Richard Bonynge]] (with [[Sherrill Milnes]] as Hamlet and [[Joan Sutherland]] as Ophelia) includes the ballet music in its proper place at the beginning of act 4, but omits significant portions of it.<!--\n\n--><ref>Bonynge's recording is based on a production he prepared for Sydney, Australia. The cuts include (page nos. refer to the [[#Scores|piano-vocal score]]): in the \"Danse Villageoise\", the second repeat (pp. 242\u2013243) and 24 bars of the chorus (pp. 247\u2013248); in the \"Pas des chasseurs\", the final 71 bars of 121 total (pp. 253\u2013255) [the recording with Hampson also omits the final 20 bars as given in the vocal score; these may not be in the full score]; in the \"Valse-Mazurke\", the repeated section with the first and second ending (pp. 260\u2013261) as well as the first 16 bars of the following section (p. 262), the first 7 bars at the top of p. 264, the final 20 bars on p. 265, and 6 bars beginning 11 bars from the end (p. 266); in the \"Sc\u00e8ne du bouquet,\" the final 10 bars marked \"Un peu plus lent\" (p. 267); in \"La Freya\", the first four pages (268\u2013271) out of eleven total; and in the \"Strette finale\", only the first 22 bars of the 62-bar Allegro are played before a jump to the section marked \"Moins vite\" on p. 282. In total, these cuts reduce the ballet proper (sections B\u2013F) to less than 15 minutes of music.

Oph\u00e9lie's opening recitative is interrupted by a [[florid music|florid]] [[cadenza]] with an ascending run up to a [[Trill (music)|trill]] on a [[forte (music)|forte]] A ([[Scientific pitch notation|A5]]).<ref>[[#PianoVocalScore|Thomas, Ambroise (1868)]], p. 287.</ref>\n\n'''Andante.''' Oph\u00e9lie tells the peasants that, should they hear that Hamlet has forgotten her, they should not believe it (Oph\u00e9lie: ''Un doux serment nous lie'' \u2013 \"A tender promise binds us to each other\").

In a more difficult alternative version, the trill on F finishes with an upward leap to forte high D ([[Scientific pitch notation|D6]]) and a quick passage descending to middle B-flat ([[Scientific pitch notation|B{{music|b}}4]]), followed by an upward octave leap to a final forte high B flat ([[Scientific pitch notation|B{{music|b}}5]]) which is held.<ref>[[#PianoVocalScore|Thomas, Ambroise (1868)]], p. 292.</ref>\n{| align=\"center\"\n|-\n|[[File:Final cadenza Valse Mad Scene Hamlet (piano-vocal score p292).jpg|thumbnail|500px|Final cadenza and variant from the Valse ([[#PianoVocalScore|piano-vocal score, p. 292]])]]\n|{{Spaces|10}}\n|}\n\n'''Ballade.''' In the mournful Ballade, Oph\u00e9lie sings about the Willis (water sprite) who lures lovers to their death, dragging them under the water until they drown (Oph\u00e9lie: ''Et maintenant \u00e9coutez ma chanson. P\u00e2le et blonde, dort sous l'onde profonde'' \u2013 \"And now listen to my song. Pale and fair, sleeping under the deep waves\"). (The Ballade replaces Shakespeare's \"Tomorrow is St. Valentine's Day\", the bawdy words of which were probably considered inappropriate at the Op\u00e9ra.)<ref name=Forbes24/> It includes a quantity of coloratura singing, and, in the words of Matthew Gurewitsch, is \"interwoven with a wordless wisp of a refrain, spun out over the nervous pulse of a drum, like birdsong from some undiscovered country.\"<ref name=Gurewitsch/> The Ballade concludes with a coloratura passage that finishes with a run up to a high E ([[Scientific pitch notation|E6]]) and a fortissimo [[Trill (music)|trill]] on A sharp ([[Scientific pitch notation|A5 sharp]]) leading to the final high B ([[Scientific pitch notation|B5]]).<ref name=Forbes24/><ref>[[#PianoVocalScore|Thomas, Ambroise (1868)]], p. 300.</ref>\n\n'''19.

A short choral passage (Peasants: ''Sa raison a fui sans retour'' \u2013 \"Her reason has fled, never to return\") introduces an orchestral reprise of the waltz music first heard before the Ballade.\n\n'''20. Finale.''' The final section begins with a soft woodwind chord followed by harp arpeggios with a wordless choral accompaniment ''\u00e0 bouches ferm\u00e9es'' (similar to the \"Humming Chorus\" from Puccini's later opera, ''[[Madama Butterfly]]'') which repeats the theme from ''P\u00e2le et blonde''. Oph\u00e9lie sings: ''Le voil\u00e0! Je crois l'entendre!'' \u2013 \"There he is! I think I hear him!\". As she leans over the water, holding onto the branches of a willow with one hand, and brushing aside the rushes with the other, she repeats some of the words and the melody ('''Theme of Hamlet's Love''')<ref name=Fauser/> from her love duet with Hamlet in act 1 (Oph\u00e9lie: ''Doute de la lumi\u00e8re'' \u2013 \"Doubt that the light illumines\"). One sees her momentarily floating in her white gown, as the current carries her away. (The action follows Gertrude's description of Ophelia's death in Shakespeare's act 4, scene 7.)<ref name=GertrudeActIVSc7>[http://www.lieder.net/lieder/get_text.html?TextId=19190 Getrude's monologue from ''Hamlet'', act 4, scene 7, at \"The Lied and Art Song Texts Page\"].</ref>\n\nAccording to Elizabeth Forbes, the opera's initial success at the Op\u00e9ra was undoubtedly mostly due to the spectacular vocal effects of the \"Mad Scene\" as executed by the original Oph\u00e9lie, [[Christine Nilsson]].<ref name=Forbes24/>\n\n===Act 5===\n''The graveyard near Elsinore.''\n\n'''21. Song of the Gravediggers.''' Two gravediggers are digging a grave (First Gravedigger: ''Dame ou prince, homme ou femme'' &ndash; \"Lady or prince, man or woman\"). '''Hamlet's Theme''' is heard in the orchestra, and he appears in the distance and slowly approaches (both Gravediggers: ''Jeune ou vieux, brune ou blonde'' &ndash; \"Young or old, dark or fair\"). They drink and sing of the pleasures of wine. Hamlet asks for whom the grave is intended. The gravediggers do not remember. (After this shortened version of the gravediggers scene, the action diverges radically from that of the Shakespeare play.)\n\n'''22. Recitative and arioso.''' Hamlet, realizing that Oph\u00e9lie has gone mad, but still unaware that she is dead, begs forgiveness for his ill treatment of her (Hamlet: ''Comme une p\u00e2le fleur'' &ndash; \"Like a delicate flower\").\n\nThe English music critic [[John Steane]], reviewing [[Simon Keenlyside]]'s performance of this aria, wrote:<blockquote>Coming after the grave-diggers' scene, it is a tender yet bitterly repentant elegy on Ophelia's death. The soliloquy has no counterpart in Shakespeare and brings out the best in both Thomas and Keenlyside. From the composer it draws on the graceful French lyricism we know from the tenor solos in ''Mignon'', adding a more complex responsiveness to the opera-Hamlet's simpler nature. For the singer, it provides an opportunity to use the refinement of his art yet rise to phrases, high in the voice, where he can expand the riches of his tones and the most heartfelt of his feelings.<ref>[[John Steane]], ''[[Gramophone (magazine)|Gramophone]]'', September 2003, p. 20.</ref></blockquote>\n\n'''Scene and recitative.''' La\u00ebrte appears in the distance, enveloped in a cape (Hamlet: ''Mais qui marche dans l'ombre? Horatio?'' &ndash; \"Who walks in the shadows? Horatio?\"). Hamlet calls out to him, and La\u00ebrte answers and comes nearer (La\u00ebrte: ''Vous avez fr\u00e9mi, Prince? ... Oui, je suis de retour; c'est moi!'' &ndash; \"Were you afraid, Prince? ... Yes, I have returned; it is I!\"). Knowing of Oph\u00e9lie's death, La\u00ebrte seeks revenge, and challenges Hamlet to a duel. They fight, and Hamlet is wounded.\n\n'''23. Funeral march and chorus.''' A funeral march is heard (Hamlet: ''\u00c9coute! Quel est ce bruit de pas?'' &ndash; \"Listen! What noise is that?\"). He asks La\u00ebrte: \"Who has died?\" La\u00ebrte, in an aside, is amazed that Hamlet still does not know. The funeral procession appears, led by a choir of men and women (Choir: ''Comme la fleur, comme la fleur nouvelle'' &ndash; \"Like a flower, like a fresh flower\"). Oph\u00e9lie's body is carried in; the King and Queen, Polonius, Marcellus, Horatio and the courtiers follow behind.\n\n'''24. Finale.''' Hamlet finally realizes who has died (Hamlet: ''Oph\u00e9lie! ... Morte! glac\u00e9e! \u00d4 crime! Oh! de leurs noirs complots d\u00e9plorable victime!'' &ndash; \"Oph\u00e9lie! ... Dead! Cold! A crime! Oh! Lamentable victim of their black conspiracy!\"). He kneels beside the body of Oph\u00e9lie: \"I have lost you!\" As the grieving Hamlet prepares to kill himself, his father's Ghost appears, visible to everyone. The King cries out \"Mercy!\", and the Ghost responds: \"The hour has passed! You, my son, finish what you have begun!\" Hamlet cries: \"Ah! Strengthen my arm to run him through. Guide my strike!\" He hurls himself upon the King. The King falls. The Queen cries out \"Dieu!\" as the others exclaim: \"The King!\" Hamlet responds: \"No! The murderer! The murderer of my father!\" The Ghost affirms: \"The crime is avenged! The cloister awaits your mother!\" The King dies with the words: ''Je meur maudit!'' &ndash; \"I die accursed!\" The Queen begs God for forgiveness, as the Ghost declares: \"Live for your people, Hamlet! God has made you King.\" Hamlet, in despair, sings: ''Mon \u00e2me est dans la tombe, h\u00e9las! Et je suis Roi!'' &ndash; \"My spirit is in the grave, alas! And I am King!\" Everyone else proclaims: \"Long live Hamlet! Long live the King!\" and the opera ends.\n\n===Alternative endings===\nA shorter version of the Finale, in which Hamlet dies, and the Ghost does not appear, is called \"le d\u00e9nouement du [[Covent Garden Theatre|The\u00e2tre de Covent Garden]]\" (\"the ending for Covent Garden\"). Thomas may have written it in the belief that the English would not accept an adaptation in which Hamlet lives. There is no evidence, however, that it was performed in Thomas's lifetime, either at Covent Garden or anywhere else. It appears in some German vocal scores and is included as an appendix to the recording with [[Thomas Hampson]] as Hamlet.\n\nThere is an additional ending prepared by [[Richard Bonynge]] for a performance in [[Sydney|Sydney, Australia]] in 1982 in which Hamlet dies of his wound suffered in the duel with La\u00ebrte. This ending appears in the recording with [[Sherrill Milnes]] as Hamlet, conducted by Bonynge.<ref name=\"Forbes26\"/>\n\n==Recordings==\n'''Audio'''\n* [[Sherrill Milnes]] (Hamlet); [[Joan Sutherland]] (Oph\u00e9lie); [[James Morris (bass-baritone)|James Morris]] (Claudius); [[G\u00f6sta Winbergh]] (La\u00ebrte); [[Barbara Smith Conrad|Barbara Conrad]] (Gertrude); [[John Tomlinson (bass)|John Tomlinson]] (Ghost); Keith Lewis (Marcellus); Philip Gelling (Horatio); Arwel Huw Morgan (Polonius); Peyo Garazzi (First Gravedigger); Joseph Rouleau (Second Gravedigger); Orchestra and Chorus of [[Welsh National Opera]]; [[Richard Bonynge]] (conductor).

They are glass tubes filled with adsorbing materials, such as [[charcoal]] or [[silica gel]], which the air to be sampled passes through. The adsorbing materials remove VOCs from the air that passes through them, and the VOCs can be desorbed and analyzed.

Traditional grab sampling does not do this, since collected samples only represent a single moment in time and multiple grab samples must be taken to observe variation in contaminant concentrations over time.<ref name = Main /> This integrative sampling method can also can result in the detection of chemicals present at such low concentrations that they would be undetected in a grab sample, due to concentration of the chemicals on the sampler over time. As a result, passive sampling has the potential to be a less time-intensive, less expensive and more accurate sampling method than grab sampling.\n\nIn addition, passive samplers are often easy to use and deploy, have no pumps or moving parts, and do not require electricity, since they rely on the [[molecular diffusion]] of contaminants or binding of contaminants to agents within the samplers, unlike active sampling.<ref name = Sigma /> They may also be inexpensive and simple to construct, such as SLMDs, which only require sealed plastic tubing and two chemical components.<ref name = Brumbaugh />\n\nPassive sampling may also more accurately reflect metal concentrations that are [[Bioavailability|bioavailable]] to organisms than other sampling methods. For example, the [[semipermeable membrane devices|SPMD]] sampler uses a semipermeable membrane and [[triolein]] (a [[triglyceride]]), both of which mimic [[toxicant]] uptake by organism fatty tissue.<ref name = POCISSPMD /> However, this depends on the type of passive sampler used, since some samplers, such as peepers, rely solely on molecular diffusion,<ref name = Peeper1 /> which may be too simple to be reflective of the [[Toxicokinetics|complex processes of contaminant uptake]] in an organism.\n\n==Disadvantages==\nSince passive sampling provides information about average contaminant concentrations, all possible concentrations over the sampler deployment time are included in this average value. However, there is no way of finding out the complete range of contaminant concentrations over the deployment time at a single site with only passive sampling.<ref name = Main /> If high and low concentrations of contaminants throughout the sampling period are needed, other sampling methods should be used in conjunction with passive sampling.\n\nNot all passive samplers have universally accurate ways to convert contaminant masses accumulated into water concentrations, which are used in government regulation, such as the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] [[Clean Water Act]].<ref name=\"EPA\">{{cite web |title=National Recommended Water Quality Criteria - Aquatic Life Criteria Table |url=https://www.epa.gov/wqc/national-recommended-water-quality-criteria-aquatic-life-criteria-table |publisher=United States Environmental Protection Agency |accessdate=4 June 2018|date=2015-09-03 }}</ref> With some samplers, as with the DGT, this can be done using equations developed for the samplers, but not all samplers have these. Passive sampler deployment time is also limited depending on the sampler's capacity; for example, SLMDs have been deployed for month-long periods, but may reach saturation and stop sampling much sooner if metal concentrations and water flow rates are high enough.<ref name = Brumbaugh /> However, this issue is avoidable if literature on the relevant passive sampler is examined for background information about sampler capacity and ideal deployment times prior to deployment.\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Environmental monitoring]]\n[[Category:Sampling techniques]]\n", "text_old": "'''Passive sampling''' is an [[environmental monitoring]] technique involving the use of a collecting medium, such as a man-made device or biological [[organism]], to accumulate chemical [[pollutant]]s in the environment over time.

They work by interacting with calcium and magnesium ions in freshwater, which forms a hydrophobic film on the outside the SLMD plastic membrane in which the chelating agent can bind to metals in the sampling water.<ref name = Brumbaugh /> They have been deployed for up to month-long periods in the field, alone or covered by a plastic tube housing to mediate water flow.<ref name=\"Missouri\">{{cite journal |last1=Brumbaugh |first1=William G |last2=May |first2=Thomas W |last3=Besser |first3=John M |last4=Allert |first4=Ann L |last5=Schmitt |first5=Christopher J |title=Assessment of Elemental Concentrations in Streams of the New Lead Belt in Southeastern Missouri, 2002\u201305 |date=2007 |publisher=United States Geological Survey}}</ref> Metal weight accumulated by a SLMD over its deployment period can be calculated and divided by the SLMD deployment time to get an average metal weight accumulated per time unit, but currently, no method has been developed to convert this to an average metal concentration. In addition, SLMD sampling rates greatly vary with water flow rate, which plastic housings can be used to control.<ref name = Brumbaugh /><ref name = Missouri />\n\n==Passive sampling in air==\nPassive sampling can also be accomplished for contaminants in the air, including airborne particles and hazardous vapors and gases. This can be done with man-made devices or with biomonitoring organisms, such as [[Lichen#Effects of air pollution|lichens]].<ref name = LichData /><ref name=\"Lichen\">{{cite journal |last1=Garty |first1=J |title=Biomonitoring Atmospheric Heavy Metals with Lichens: Theory and Application |journal=Critical Reviews in Plant Sciences |date=2001 |volume=20 |issue=4 |pages=309\u2013371 |doi=10.1080/20013591099254 }}</ref>\n\n===Sorbent tubes===\n{{Main|Sorbent tube}}\nSorbent tubes are passive samplers for [[volatile organic compound]]s (VOCs). They are glass tubes filled with adsorbing materials, such as [[charcoal]] or [[silica gel]], which the air to be sampled passes through. The adsorbing materials remove VOCs from the air that passes through them, and the VOCs can be desorbed and analyzed. Air concentrations can be calculated using the amount of air that flowed through the sorbent tube and the amount of contaminants desorbed.<ref name=\"Tubes\">{{cite web |title=Sorbent tubes |url=http://airsamplingsolutions.com/index.php/sorbent-tubes/ |website=Air Sampling Solutions |publisher=Casella |accessdate=3 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Advantages==\nContaminant concentrations from passive sampling reflect average contamination throughout the sampler deployment time, meaning the sample will capture contaminant concentration fluctuations over the whole deployment period. Traditional grab sampling does not do this, since collected samples only represent a single moment in time and multiple grab samples must be taken to observe variation in contaminant concentrations over time.<ref name = Main /> This integrative sampling method can also can result in the detection of chemicals present at such low concentrations that they would be undetected in a grab sample, due to concentration of the chemicals on the sampler over time. As a result, passive sampling has the potential to be a less time-intensive, less expensive and more accurate sampling method than grab sampling.\n\nIn addition, passive samplers are often easy to use and deploy, have no pumps or moving parts, and do not require electricity, since they rely on the [[molecular diffusion]] of contaminants or binding of contaminants to agents within the samplers, unlike active sampling.<ref name = Sigma /> They may also be inexpensive and simple to construct, such as SLMDs, which only require sealed plastic tubing and two chemical components.<ref name = Brumbaugh />\n\nPassive sampling may also more accurately reflect metal concentrations that are [[Bioavailability|bioavailable]] to organisms than other sampling methods. For example, the [[semipermeable membrane devices|SPMD]] sampler uses a semipermeable membrane and [[triolein]] (a [[triglyceride]]), both of which mimic [[toxicant]] uptake by organism fatty tissue.<ref name = POCISSPMD /> However, this depends on the type of passive sampler used, since some samplers, such as peepers, rely solely on molecular diffusion,<ref name = Peeper1 /> which may be too simple to be reflective of the [[Toxicokinetics|complex processes of contaminant uptake]] in an organism.\n\n==Disadvantages==\nSince passive sampling provides information about average contaminant concentrations, all possible concentrations over the sampler deployment time are included in this average value. However, there is no way of finding out the complete range of contaminant concentrations over the deployment time at a single site with only passive sampling.<ref name = Main /> If high and low concentrations of contaminants throughout the sampling period are needed, other sampling methods should be used in conjunction with passive sampling.\n\nNot all passive samplers have universally accurate ways to convert contaminant masses accumulated into water concentrations, which are used in government regulation, such as the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] [[Clean Water Act]].<ref name=\"EPA\">{{cite web |title=National Recommended Water Quality Criteria - Aquatic Life Criteria Table |url=https://www.epa.gov/wqc/national-recommended-water-quality-criteria-aquatic-life-criteria-table |publisher=United States Environmental Protection Agency |accessdate=4 June 2018|date=2015-09-03 }}</ref> With some samplers, as with the DGT, this can be done using equations developed for the samplers, but not all samplers have these. Passive sampler deployment time is also limited depending on the sampler's capacity; for example, SLMDs have been deployed for month-long periods, but may reach saturation and stop sampling much sooner if metal concentrations and water flow rates are high enough.<ref name = Brumbaugh /> However, this issue is avoidable if literature on the relevant passive sampler is examined for background information about sampler capacity and ideal deployment times prior to deployment.\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Environmental monitoring]]\n[[Category:Sampling techniques]]\n", "name_user": "Rjwilmsi", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200etop:Journal cites:,", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_sampling"}

This tetrarchy lasted until c.&nbsp;313, when mutually destructive civil wars eliminated most of the claimants to power, leaving [[Constantine the Great|Constantine]] in control of the western half of the empire, and [[Licinius]] in control of the eastern half.\n\n==Terminology==\nThe term \"'''tetrarchy'''\" (from the {{lang-el|\u03c4\u03b5\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1\u03c1\u03c7\u03af\u03b1}}, ''tetrarchia'', \"leadership of four [people]\"){{efn|Historian [[David Potter (historian)|David Potter]] translates the term as \"[[Gang of Four|gang of four]]\". See idem., ''Constantine the Emperor'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2013), 1.}} describes any form of government where power is divided among four individuals.\n\nAlthough the term \"tetrarch\" was current in antiquity, it was never used of the imperial college under Diocletian. Instead, the term was used to describe independent portions of a kingdom that were ruled under separate leaders.  The [[Tetrarchy (Judea)|tetrarchy of Judaea]], established after the death of [[Herod the Great]], is the most famous example of the antique tetrarchy.  The term was understood in the Latin world as well, where [[Pliny the Elder]] glossed it as follows: \"each is the equivalent of a kingdom, and also part of one\" (''regnorum instar singulae et in regna contribuuntur'').<ref>Qtd. and tr. Leadbetter, ''Galerius'', 3.</ref>\n\nAs used by the ancients, the term describes not only different governments, but also a different system of government from the Diocletianic arrangements.  The Judaean tetrarchy was a set of four independent and distinct states, where each tetrarch ruled a quarter of a kingdom as they saw fit; the Diocletianic tetrarchy was a [[College (canon law)|college]] led by a single supreme leader.  When later authors described the period, this is what they emphasized: [[Ammianus Marcellinus|Ammianus]] had Constantius II admonish [[Constantius Gallus|Gallus]] for disobedience by appealing to the example in submission set by Diocletian's lesser colleagues; his successor Julian compared the Diocletianic tetrarchs to a chorus surrounding a leader, speaking in unison under his command.<ref>Amm. Marc. 14.11.10; Jul. ''Caes''. 315A-B.</ref>  Only [[Lactantius]], a contemporary of Diocletian and a deep ideological opponent of the Diocletianic state, referred to the tetrarchs as a simple multiplicity of rulers.<ref>Leadbetter, ''Galerius'', 3.</ref>\n\nMuch modern scholarship was written without the term.  Although [[Edward Gibbon]] pioneered the description of the Diocletianic government as a \"New Empire\", he never used the term \"tetrarchy\"; neither did [[Theodor Mommsen]].  It did not appear in the literature until used in 1887 by schoolmaster Hermann Schiller in a two-volume handbook on the Roman Empire (''Geschichte der R\u00f6mischen Kaiserzeit''), to wit: \"''die diokletianische Tetrarchie''\".  Even so, the term did not catch on in the literature until [[Otto Seeck]] used it in 1897.<ref>Leadbetter, ''Galerius'', 3\u20134.</ref>\n\n==Creation<!--Linked from 'Byzantine Empire'-->==\nThe first phase, sometimes referred to as the [[diarchy]] (\"rule of two\"), involved the designation of the general [[Maximian]] as co-emperor\u2014firstly as ''[[Caesar (title)|Caesar]]'' (junior emperor) in 285, followed by his promotion to ''[[Augustus (honorific)|Augustus]]'' in 286. [[Diocletian]] took care of matters in the eastern regions of the empire while Maximian similarly took charge of the western regions. In 293, Diocletian thought that more focus was needed on both civic and military problems, so with Maximian's consent, he expanded the imperial college by appointing two ''Caesars'' (one responsible to each ''Augustus'')\u2014[[Galerius]] and [[Constantius Chlorus]].<ref>The chronology has been thoroughly established by Kolb, ''Diocletian'', and Kuhoff, ''Diokletian''.</ref>\n\nIn 305, the senior emperors jointly abdicated and retired, allowing Constantius and Galerius to be elevated in rank to ''Augustus''. They in turn appointed two new Caesars\u2014[[Flavius Valerius Severus|Severus II]] in the west under Constantius, and [[Maximinus II|Maximinus]] in the east under Galerius\u2014thereby creating the second Tetrarchy.\n\n== Regions and capitals ==\n<!--Linked from [[Roman Empire]]-->\n[[File:Tetrarchy map3.jpg|thumb|left|Map of the Roman Empire under the Tetrarchy, showing the dioceses and the four tetrarchs' zones of influence.]]\n\nThe four tetrarchs based themselves not at Rome but in other cities closer to the frontiers, mainly intended as headquarters for the defence of the empire against bordering rivals (notably [[Sassanid dynasty|Sassanian Persia]]) and [[barbarian]]s (mainly Germanic, and an unending sequence of nomadic or displaced tribes from the eastern steppes) at the Rhine and Danube. These centres are known as the tetrarchic capitals. Although Rome ceased to be an operational capital, Rome continued to be nominal capital of the entire Roman Empire, not reduced to the status of a province but under its own, unique Prefect of the City ([[praefectus urbi]], later copied in Constantinople).\n\nThe four tetrarchic capitals were:\n\n*[[Nicomedia]] in northwestern Asia Minor (modern [[Izmit]] in Turkey), a base for defence against invasion from the Balkans and Persia's Sassanids was the capital of Diocletian, the eastern (and most senior) Augustus; in the final reorganisation by Constantine the Great, in 318, the equivalent of his domain, facing the most redoubtable foreign enemy, [[Sassanid Persia]], became the pretorian prefecture Oriens, 'the East', the core of later Byzantium.\n*[[Sirmium]] (modern [[Sremska Mitrovica]] in the [[Vojvodina]] region of modern [[Serbia]], and near [[Belgrade]], on the [[Danube]] border) was the capital of Galerius, the eastern Caesar; this was to become the Balkans-Danube prefecture Illyricum.\n*[[Mediolanum]] (modern [[Milan]], near the Alps) was the capital of Maximian, the western Augustus; his domain became \"Italia et Africa\", with only a short exterior border.\n*[[Augusta Treverorum]] (modern [[Trier]], in Germany) was the capital of Constantius Chlorus, the western Caesar, near the strategic Rhine border; it had been the capital of Gallic emperor [[Tetricus I]]. This quarter became the prefecture Galliae.\n\n[[Aquileia]], a port on the Adriatic coast, and [[Eboracum]] (modern [[York]], in northern England near the Celtic tribes of modern Scotland and Ireland), were also significant centres for Maximian and Constantius respectively.\n\nIn terms of regional jurisdiction there was no precise division among the four tetrarchs, and this period did not see the Roman state actually split up into four distinct sub-empires. Each emperor had his zone of influence within the Roman Empire, but little more, mainly high command in a 'war theater'. Each tetrarch was himself often in the field, while delegating most of the administration to the hierarchic bureaucracy headed by his respective [[Pretorian Prefect]], each supervising several [[Vicarii]], the governors-general in charge of another, lasting new administrative level, the civil [[Roman diocese|diocese]]. For a listing of the provinces, now known as [[eparchy]], within each quarter (known as a praetorian prefecture), see [[Roman province]].\n\nIn the West, the Augustus Maximian controlled the provinces west of the Adriatic Sea and the Syrtis, and within that region his Caesar, Constantius, controlled Gaul and Britain. In the East, the arrangements between the Augustus Diocletian and his Caesar, Galerius, were much more flexible.\n\nHowever, it appears that some contemporary and later writers, such as the Christian author [[Lactantius]], and [[Sextus Aurelius Victor]] (who wrote about fifty years later and from uncertain sources), misunderstood the tetrarchic system in this respect, believing it to have involved a stricter division of territories among the four emperors.\n\n==Public image==\nAlthough power was shared in the tetrarchic system, the public image of the four emperors in the imperial college was carefully managed to give the appearance of a united empire (''patrimonium indivisum''). This was especially important after [[Crisis of the Third Century|the numerous civil wars of the 3rd century]].\n\nThe tetrarchs appeared identical in all official portraits. Coinage dating from the tetrarchic period depicts every emperor with identical features\u2014only the inscriptions on the coins indicate which one of the four emperors is being shown. The Byzantine sculpture ''[[Portrait of the Four Tetrarchs]]'' shows the tetrarchs again with identical features and wearing the same military costume.\n\n==Military successes==\nOne of the greatest problems facing emperors in the Third Century Crisis was that they were only ever able to personally command troops on one front at any one time. While [[Aurelian]] and [[Marcus Aurelius Probus|Probus]] were prepared to accompany their armies thousands of miles between war regions, this was not an ideal solution. Furthermore, it was risky for an emperor to delegate power in his absence to a subordinate general, who might win a victory and then be proclaimed as a rival emperor himself by his troops (which often happened). All members of the imperial college, on the other hand, were of essentially equal rank, despite two being senior emperors and two being junior; their functions and authorities were also equal.\n\nUnder the Tetrarchy a number of important military victories were secured. Both the Dyarchic and the tetrarchic system ensured that an emperor was near to every crisis area to personally direct and remain in control of campaigns simultaneously on more than just one front. After suffering a defeat by the [[Persia]]ns in 296, Galerius crushed [[Narseh]] in 298\u2014reversing a series of Roman defeats throughout the century\u2014capturing members of the imperial household and a substantial amount of booty and gaining a highly favourable peace treaty, which secured peace between the two powers for a generation. Similarly, Constantius defeated the British usurper [[Allectus]], Maximian pacified the Gauls, and Diocletian crushed the revolt of [[Domitius Domitianus|Domitianus]] in [[Egypt]].\n\n==Demise==\n{{Main|Civil wars of the Tetrarchy}}\nWhen in 305 the 20-year term of Diocletian and Maximian ended, both abdicated. Their Caesares, Galerius and Constantius Chlorus, were both raised to the rank of Augustus, and two new Caesares were appointed: [[Maximinus II|Maximinus]] (Caesar to Galerius) and [[Flavius Valerius Severus]] (Caesar to Constantius). These four formed the second tetrarchy.\n\n[[File:Raphael-Constantine at Milvian Bridge.jpg|thumb|200px|''Constantine at the [[battle of the Milvian Bridge]]'', fresco by [[Raphael]], Vatican Rooms.]]\nHowever, the system broke down very quickly thereafter. When Constantius died in 306, Galerius promoted Severus to Augustus while [[Constantine the Great|Constantine]], Constantius' son, was proclaimed Augustus by his father's troops. At the same time, [[Maxentius]], the son of Maximian, who also resented being left out of the new arrangements, defeated Severus before forcing him to abdicate and then arranging his murder in 307. Maxentius and Maximian both then declared themselves Augusti. By 308 there were therefore no fewer than four claimants to the rank of Augustus (Galerius, Constantine, Maximian and Maxentius), and only one to that of Caesar (Maximinus).\n\nIn 308 Galerius, together with the retired emperor Diocletian and the supposedly retired Maximian, called an imperial \"conference\" at [[Carnuntum]] on the River Danube. The council agreed that [[Licinius]] would become Augustus in the West, with Constantine as his Caesar. In the East, Galerius remained Augustus and Maximinus remained his Caesar. Maximian was to retire, and Maxentius was declared a usurper. This agreement proved disastrous: by 308 Maxentius had become ''de facto'' ruler of Italy and Africa even without any imperial rank, and neither Constantine nor Maximinus\u2014who had both been Caesares since 306 and 305 respectively\u2014were prepared to tolerate the promotion of the Augustus Licinius as their superior.\n\nAfter an abortive attempt to placate both Constantine and Maximinus with the meaningless title ''filius Augusti'' (\"son of the Augustus\"), essentially an alternative title for Caesar), they both had to be recognised as Augusti in 309. However, four full Augusti all at odds with each other did not bode well for the tetrarchic system.\n\nBetween 309 and 313 most of the claimants to the imperial office died or were killed in various civil wars. Constantine forced Maximian's suicide in 310. Galerius died naturally in 311. Maxentius was defeated by Constantine at the [[Battle of the Milvian Bridge]] in 312 and subsequently killed. Maximinus committed suicide at [[Tarsus (city)|Tarsus]] in 313 after being defeated in battle by Licinius.\n\nBy 313, therefore, there remained only two emperors: Constantine in the West and Licinius in the East. The tetrarchic system was at an end, although it took until 324 for Constantine to finally defeat Licinius, reunite the two halves of the Roman Empire and declare himself sole Augustus.\n\n==Timeline==\n{| width=100% class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=4| <big>Diarchy</big><br />21 July 285 - 1 March 293\n|-\n!

The fourfold regional division of the empire continued in the form of [[Praetorian prefecture]]s, each of which was overseen by a [[praetorian prefect]] and subdivided into administrative [[Roman diocese|dioceses]], and often reappeared in the title of the military supra-provincial command assigned to a [[magister militum]].\n\nThe pre-existing notion of ''[[consortium imperii]]'', the sharing of imperial power, and the notion that an associate to the throne was the designated successor (possibly conflicting with the notion of hereditary claim by birth or adoption), was to reappear repeatedly.\n\nThe idea of the two halves, the east and the west, re-emerged and eventually resulted in the permanent de facto division into two separate Roman empires after the death of [[Theodosius I]], though it is important to remember that the empire was never formally divided, the emperors of the eastern and western halves legally ruling as one imperial college until the fall of Rome's western empire left Byzantium, the \"second Rome\", sole direct heir.\n\n==Other examples==\n{{Monarchism}}\n*Tetrarchies in the ancient world existed in both [[Thessaly]] (in northern Greece) and [[Galatia]] (in central [[Asia Minor]]; including [[Lycaonia]]) as well as among the British [[Cantiaci]].\n*The constellation of Jewish principalities in the [[Herodian kingdom]] of [[Judea]] was known as a tetrarchy; see [[Tetrarchy (Judea)]].\n*In the novel ''[[The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe]]'', the [[Pevensie]] siblings rule [[Narnia (world)|Narnia]] as a tetrarchy of two kings and two queens.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Notitia dignitatum]], a later document from the imperial chancery\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==Citations==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n<!-- Alphabetic order-->\n*{{cite book\n  | last = Barnes\n  | first = Timothy D. \n  | authorlink = Timothy Barnes\n  | title =Constantine and Eusebius\n  | publisher = [[Harvard University Press]]\n  | year = 1984\n  | pages = \n  | isbn = 0-674-16531-4 }}\n*{{cite book\n  | last = Bowman\n  | first = Alan\n  | title = The Cambridge Ancient History Volume 12, The Crisis of Empire, AD 193\u2013337\n  | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]]\n  | year =2005\n  | pages = \n  | url =\n  | isbn = 0-521-30199-8 }}\n*{{cite book\n  | last = Corcoran\n  | first = Simon \n  | authorlink=Simon Corcoran\n  | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=27XwuaqMmt0C\n  | title = The Empire of the Tetrarchs, Imperial Pronouncements and Government AD 284\u2013324\n  | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]]\n  | year = 2000\n  | isbn =0-19-815304-X }}\n* {{cite book |first=Frank |last=Kolb |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SVe6hD-MG9AC |location=Berlin |publisher=de Gruyter |language=de|title=Diocletian und die Erste Tetrarchie: Improvisation oder Experiment in der Organisation monarchischer Herrschaft? |isbn=9783110846508 |date=2011-07-11 }}\n* {{cite book |last=Kuhoff |first=Wolfgang |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gQnFQgAACAAJ |location=Frankfurt am Main |publisher=Lang |title=Diokletian und die Epoche der Tetrarchie: Das r\u00f6mische Reich zwischen Krisenbew\u00e4ltigung und Neuaufbau (284-313 n.

This tetrarchy lasted until c.&nbsp;313, when mutually destructive civil wars eliminated most of the claimants to power, leaving [[Constantine the Great|Constantine]] in control of the western half of the empire, and [[Licinius]] in control of the eastern half.\n\n==Terminology==\nThe term \"'''tetrarchy'''\" (from the {{lang-el|\u03c4\u03b5\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1\u03c1\u03c7\u03af\u03b1}}, ''tetrarchia'', \"leadership of four [people]\"){{efn|Historian [[David Potter (historian)|David Potter]] translates the term as \"[[Gang of Four|gang of four]]\". See idem., ''Constantine the Emperor'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2013), 1.}} describes any form of government where power is divided among four individuals.\n\nAlthough the term \"tetrarch\" was current in antiquity, it was never used of the imperial college under Diocletian. Instead, the term was used to describe independent portions of a kingdom that were ruled under separate leaders.  The [[Tetrarchy (Judea)|tetrarchy of Judaea]], established after the death of [[Herod the Great]], is the most famous example of the antique tetrarchy.  The term was understood in the Latin world as well, where [[Pliny the Elder]] glossed it as follows: \"each is the equivalent of a kingdom, and also part of one\" (''regnorum instar singulae et in regna contribuuntur'').<ref>Qtd. and tr. Leadbetter, ''Galerius'', 3.</ref>\n\nAs used by the ancients, the term describes not only different governments, but also a different system of government from the Diocletianic arrangements.  The Judaean tetrarchy was a set of four independent and distinct states, where each tetrarch ruled a quarter of a kingdom as they saw fit; the Diocletianic tetrarchy was a [[College (canon law)|college]] led by a single supreme leader.  When later authors described the period, this is what they emphasized: [[Ammianus Marcellinus|Ammianus]] had Constantius II admonish [[Constantius Gallus|Gallus]] for disobedience by appealing to the example in submission set by Diocletian's lesser colleagues; his successor Julian compared the Diocletianic tetrarchs to a chorus surrounding a leader, speaking in unison under his command.<ref>Amm. Marc. 14.11.10; Jul. ''Caes''. 315A-B.</ref>  Only [[Lactantius]], a contemporary of Diocletian and a deep ideological opponent of the Diocletianic state, referred to the tetrarchs as a simple multiplicity of rulers.<ref>Leadbetter, ''Galerius'', 3.</ref>\n\nMuch modern scholarship was written without the term.  Although [[Edward Gibbon]] pioneered the description of the Diocletianic government as a \"New Empire\", he never used the term \"tetrarchy\"; neither did [[Theodor Mommsen]].  It did not appear in the literature until used in 1887 by schoolmaster Hermann Schiller in a two-volume handbook on the Roman Empire (''Geschichte der R\u00f6mischen Kaiserzeit''), to wit: \"''die diokletianische Tetrarchie''\".  Even so, the term did not catch on in the literature until [[Otto Seeck]] used it in 1897.<ref>Leadbetter, ''Galerius'', 3\u20134.</ref>\n\n==Creation<!--Linked from 'Byzantine Empire'-->==\nThe first phase, sometimes referred to as the [[diarchy]] (\"rule of two\"), involved the designation of the general [[Maximian]] as co-emperor\u2014firstly as ''[[Caesar (title)|Caesar]]'' (junior emperor) in 285, followed by his promotion to ''[[Augustus (honorific)|Augustus]]'' in 286. [[Diocletian]] took care of matters in the eastern regions of the empire while Maximian similarly took charge of the western regions. In 293, Diocletian thought that more focus was needed on both civic and military problems, so with Maximian's consent, he expanded the imperial college by appointing two ''Caesars'' (one responsible to each ''Augustus'')\u2014[[Galerius]] and [[Constantius Chlorus]].<ref>The chronology has been thoroughly established by Kolb, ''Diocletian'', and Kuhoff, ''Diokletian''.</ref>\n\nIn 305, the senior emperors jointly abdicated and retired, allowing Constantius and Galerius to be elevated in rank to ''Augustus''. They in turn appointed two new Caesars\u2014[[Flavius Valerius Severus|Severus II]] in the west under Constantius, and [[Maximinus II|Maximinus]] in the east under Galerius\u2014thereby creating the second Tetrarchy.\n\n== Regions and capitals ==\n<!--Linked from [[Roman Empire]]-->\n[[File:Tetrarchy map3.jpg|thumb|left|Map of the Roman Empire under the Tetrarchy, showing the dioceses and the four tetrarchs' zones of influence.]]\n\nThe four tetrarchs based themselves not at Rome but in other cities closer to the frontiers, mainly intended as headquarters for the defence of the empire against bordering rivals (notably [[Sassanid dynasty|Sassanian Persia]]) and [[barbarian]]s (mainly Germanic, and an unending sequence of nomadic or displaced tribes from the eastern steppes) at the Rhine and Danube. These centres are known as the tetrarchic capitals. Although Rome ceased to be an operational capital, Rome continued to be nominal capital of the entire Roman Empire, not reduced to the status of a province but under its own, unique Prefect of the City ([[praefectus urbi]], later copied in Constantinople).\n\nThe four tetrarchic capitals were:\n\n*[[Nicomedia]] in northwestern Asia Minor (modern [[Izmit]] in Turkey), a base for defence against invasion from the Balkans and Persia's Sassanids was the capital of Diocletian, the eastern (and most senior) Augustus; in the final reorganisation by Constantine the Great, in 318, the equivalent of his domain, facing the most redoubtable foreign enemy, [[Sassanid Persia]], became the pretorian prefecture Oriens, 'the East', the core of later Byzantium.\n*[[Sirmium]] (modern [[Sremska Mitrovica]] in the [[Vojvodina]] region of modern [[Serbia]], and near [[Belgrade]], on the [[Danube]] border) was the capital of Galerius, the eastern Caesar; this was to become the Balkans-Danube prefecture Illyricum.\n*[[Mediolanum]] (modern [[Milan]], near the Alps) was the capital of Maximian, the western Augustus; his domain became \"Italia et Africa\", with only a short exterior border.\n*[[Augusta Treverorum]] (modern [[Trier]], in Germany) was the capital of Constantius Chlorus, the western Caesar, near the strategic Rhine border; it had been the capital of Gallic emperor [[Tetricus I]]. This quarter became the prefecture Galliae.\n\n[[Aquileia]], a port on the Adriatic coast, and [[Eboracum]] (modern [[York]], in northern England near the Celtic tribes of modern Scotland and Ireland), were also significant centres for Maximian and Constantius respectively.\n\nIn terms of regional jurisdiction there was no precise division among the four tetrarchs, and this period did not see the Roman state actually split up into four distinct sub-empires. Each emperor had his zone of influence within the Roman Empire, but little more, mainly high command in a 'war theater'. Each tetrarch was himself often in the field, while delegating most of the administration to the hierarchic bureaucracy headed by his respective [[Pretorian Prefect]], each supervising several [[Vicarii]], the governors-general in charge of another, lasting new administrative level, the civil [[Roman diocese|diocese]]. For a listing of the provinces, now known as [[eparchy]], within each quarter (known as a praetorian prefecture), see [[Roman province]].\n\nIn the West, the Augustus Maximian controlled the provinces west of the Adriatic Sea and the Syrtis, and within that region his Caesar, Constantius, controlled Gaul and Britain. In the East, the arrangements between the Augustus Diocletian and his Caesar, Galerius, were much more flexible.\n\nHowever, it appears that some contemporary and later writers, such as the Christian author [[Lactantius]], and [[Sextus Aurelius Victor]] (who wrote about fifty years later and from uncertain sources), misunderstood the tetrarchic system in this respect, believing it to have involved a stricter division of territories among the four emperors.\n\n==Public image==\nAlthough power was shared in the tetrarchic system, the public image of the four emperors in the imperial college was carefully managed to give the appearance of a united empire (''patrimonium indivisum''). This was especially important after [[Crisis of the Third Century|the numerous civil wars of the 3rd century]].\n\nThe tetrarchs appeared identical in all official portraits. Coinage dating from the tetrarchic period depicts every emperor with identical features\u2014only the inscriptions on the coins indicate which one of the four emperors is being shown. The Byzantine sculpture ''[[Portrait of the Four Tetrarchs]]'' shows the tetrarchs again with identical features and wearing the same military costume.\n\n==Military successes==\nOne of the greatest problems facing emperors in the Third Century Crisis was that they were only ever able to personally command troops on one front at any one time. While [[Aurelian]] and [[Marcus Aurelius Probus|Probus]] were prepared to accompany their armies thousands of miles between war regions, this was not an ideal solution. Furthermore, it was risky for an emperor to delegate power in his absence to a subordinate general, who might win a victory and then be proclaimed as a rival emperor himself by his troops (which often happened). All members of the imperial college, on the other hand, were of essentially equal rank, despite two being senior emperors and two being junior; their functions and authorities were also equal.\n\nUnder the Tetrarchy a number of important military victories were secured. Both the Dyarchic and the tetrarchic system ensured that an emperor was near to every crisis area to personally direct and remain in control of campaigns simultaneously on more than just one front. After suffering a defeat by the [[Persia]]ns in 296, Galerius crushed [[Narseh]] in 298\u2014reversing a series of Roman defeats throughout the century\u2014capturing members of the imperial household and a substantial amount of booty and gaining a highly favourable peace treaty, which secured peace between the two powers for a generation. Similarly, Constantius defeated the British usurper [[Allectus]], Maximian pacified the Gauls, and Diocletian crushed the revolt of [[Domitius Domitianus|Domitianus]] in [[Egypt]].\n\n==Demise==\n{{Main|Civil wars of the Tetrarchy}}\nWhen in 305 the 20-year term of Diocletian and Maximian ended, both abdicated. Their Caesares, Galerius and Constantius Chlorus, were both raised to the rank of Augustus, and two new Caesares were appointed: [[Maximinus II|Maximinus]] (Caesar to Galerius) and [[Flavius Valerius Severus]] (Caesar to Constantius). These four formed the second tetrarchy.\n\n[[File:Raphael-Constantine at Milvian Bridge.jpg|thumb|200px|''Constantine at the [[battle of the Milvian Bridge]]'', fresco by [[Raphael]], Vatican Rooms.]]\nHowever, the system broke down very quickly thereafter. When Constantius died in 306, Galerius promoted Severus to Augustus while [[Constantine the Great|Constantine]], Constantius' son, was proclaimed Augustus by his father's troops. At the same time, [[Maxentius]], the son of Maximian, who also resented being left out of the new arrangements, defeated Severus before forcing him to abdicate and then arranging his murder in 307. Maxentius and Maximian both then declared themselves Augusti. By 308 there were therefore no fewer than four claimants to the rank of Augustus (Galerius, Constantine, Maximian and Maxentius), and only one to that of Caesar (Maximinus).\n\nIn 308 Galerius, together with the retired emperor Diocletian and the supposedly retired Maximian, called an imperial \"conference\" at [[Carnuntum]] on the River Danube. The council agreed that [[Licinius]] would become Augustus in the West, with Constantine as his Caesar. In the East, Galerius remained Augustus and Maximinus remained his Caesar. Maximian was to retire, and Maxentius was declared a usurper. This agreement proved disastrous: by 308 Maxentius had become ''de facto'' ruler of Italy and Africa even without any imperial rank, and neither Constantine nor Maximinus\u2014who had both been Caesares since 306 and 305 respectively\u2014were prepared to tolerate the promotion of the Augustus Licinius as their superior.\n\nAfter an abortive attempt to placate both Constantine and Maximinus with the meaningless title ''filius Augusti'' (\"son of the Augustus\"), essentially an alternative title for Caesar), they both had to be recognised as Augusti in 309. However, four full Augusti all at odds with each other did not bode well for the tetrarchic system.\n\nBetween 309 and 313 most of the claimants to the imperial office died or were killed in various civil wars. Constantine forced Maximian's suicide in 310. Galerius died naturally in 311. Maxentius was defeated by Constantine at the [[Battle of the Milvian Bridge]] in 312 and subsequently killed. Maximinus committed suicide at [[Tarsus (city)|Tarsus]] in 313 after being defeated in battle by Licinius.\n\nBy 313, therefore, there remained only two emperors: Constantine in the West and Licinius in the East. The tetrarchic system was at an end, although it took until 324 for Constantine to finally defeat Licinius, reunite the two halves of the Roman Empire and declare himself sole Augustus.\n\n==Timeline==\n{| width=100% class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=4| <big>Diarchy</big><br />21 July 285 - 1 March 293\n|-\n!

This was apparent from coins, though Valens was apparently inferior to Licinius, who soon executed him.

Both ''Augusti'' appoint their own sons as co-emperors, restoring a dynastic system. However, before his death, Licinius appoints the General [[Martinianus]] on 3 July 324 as ''Augustus'' in name only, as Martinianus was intended to replace Constantine in the west.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n\n|-\n\n!                                               !!

The fourfold regional division of the empire continued in the form of [[Praetorian prefecture]]s, each of which was overseen by a [[praetorian prefect]] and subdivided into administrative [[Roman diocese|dioceses]], and often reappeared in the title of the military supra-provincial command assigned to a [[magister militum]].\n\nThe pre-existing notion of ''[[consortium imperii]]'', the sharing of imperial power, and the notion that an associate to the throne was the designated successor (possibly conflicting with the notion of hereditary claim by birth or adoption), was to reappear repeatedly.\n\nThe idea of the two halves, the east and the west, re-emerged and eventually resulted in the permanent de facto division into two separate Roman empires after the death of [[Theodosius I]], though it is important to remember that the empire was never formally divided, the emperors of the eastern and western halves legally ruling as one imperial college until the fall of Rome's western empire left Byzantium, the \"second Rome\", sole direct heir.\n\n==Other examples==\n{{Monarchism}}\n*Tetrarchies in the ancient world existed in both [[Thessaly]] (in northern Greece) and [[Galatia]] (in central [[Asia Minor]]; including [[Lycaonia]]) as well as among the British [[Cantiaci]].\n*The constellation of Jewish principalities in the [[Herodian kingdom]] of [[Judea]] was known as a tetrarchy; see [[Tetrarchy (Judea)]].\n*In the novel ''[[The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe]]'', the [[Pevensie]] siblings rule [[Narnia (world)|Narnia]] as a tetrarchy of two kings and two queens.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Notitia dignitatum]], a later document from the imperial chancery\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==Citations==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n<!-- Alphabetic order-->\n*{{cite book\n  | last = Barnes\n  | first = Timothy D. \n  | authorlink = Timothy Barnes\n  | title =Constantine and Eusebius\n  | publisher = [[Harvard University Press]]\n  | year = 1984\n  | pages = \n  | isbn = 0-674-16531-4 }}\n*{{cite book\n  | last = Bowman\n  | first = Alan\n  | title = The Cambridge Ancient History Volume 12, The Crisis of Empire, AD 193\u2013337\n  | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]]\n  | year =2005\n  | pages = \n  | url =\n  | isbn = 0-521-30199-8 }}\n*{{cite book\n  | last = Corcoran\n  | first = Simon \n  | authorlink=Simon Corcoran\n  | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=27XwuaqMmt0C\n  | title = The Empire of the Tetrarchs, Imperial Pronouncements and Government AD 284\u2013324\n  | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]]\n  | year = 2000\n  | isbn =0-19-815304-X }}\n* {{cite book |first=Frank |last=Kolb |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SVe6hD-MG9AC |location=Berlin |publisher=de Gruyter |language=de|title=Diocletian und die Erste Tetrarchie: Improvisation oder Experiment in der Organisation monarchischer Herrschaft? |isbn=9783110846508 |date=2011-07-11 }}\n* {{cite book |last=Kuhoff |first=Wolfgang |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gQnFQgAACAAJ |location=Frankfurt am Main |publisher=Lang |title=Diokletian und die Epoche der Tetrarchie: Das r\u00f6mische Reich zwischen Krisenbew\u00e4ltigung und Neuaufbau (284-313 n.
