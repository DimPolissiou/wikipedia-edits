Payment of the alms tax, [[Zakat]], as well as its agricultural counterpart, [[Islamic taxes#Ushr|Ushr]], were traditionally private obligations for Muslims in Pakistan. Together they generally represented 2.5% of annual household savings and served as a sort of wealth tax to be redistributed to the Muslim community's poor.<ref>Nelson, Matthew (2008) ''In the Shadow of Shari'ah.''</ref> One of the provisions of the 1973 constitution already stipulated that these taxes should be collected by the government. But [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto|Bhutto]] had made no move to implement it. In 1979, Zia decided to transform what was considered a personal duty of solidarity into a legal obligation. The \"Zakat and Ushr Ordinance\" was issued on 20 June 1980. Its urban component,''zakat'', took effect in 1981, whereas ''ushr'' did not come into effect until 1983. The system by which these taxes were previously levied was replaced by a specific agency to rationalize the collection & distribution of funds, a process that Malik describes as follows:\n\nOn the first day of the fasting month of Ramadan, the Zakat Deducting Agencies (banks,post-offices etc.) by means of deduction at source withdraw 2.5% from all saving accounts above a certain exemption limit (fixed at Rs. 1,000 in the first year of Zakat deduction, 1980). They transfer the Zakat thus collected to the Central Zakat Fund (CZF). This fund is fed also with proceeds from 'voluntary Zakat' and 'donations' and from funds of other institutions. Following certain criteria, the Zakat is then distributed among the Provincial Zakat Funds (PZFs) and the National Zakat Foundation (NZF). Following prescribed quota, the PZFs turn over funds to the Local Zakat Funds (LZFs), to other institutions, to the needy (mustaqhin) and to the National Zakat Foundation.<ref>Malik, Jamal (1996) ''Colonization of Islam''.</ref>\n\nWhile ''ushr'' is distributed in the locality where it was collected, the distribution process of the ''zakat'' shows a whole bureaucratic pyramid in action. Here again, the Islamization policy reinforced state control over religious institutions. Further evidence of this was the Tehsil/Taluka/Subdivisional and Local Committees (Removal of Chairman and Members) Rule (1981), which allowed the state to dismiss the president of a local Zakat Committee, an institution that was previously independent of the state. In 1981, ''Al Zakat'', an influential national monthly publication boasted that 250,000 persons were involved in the new system of collecting and distributing zakat funds.\nThe fiscal dimension of Zia's Islamization policy fostered a rise in sectarianism, a term that in Pakistan denotes the conflict between Sunni and Shia Muslims. As soon as Zia's plans for ''zakat'' and ''ushr'' were made public, Shia leaders objected that according to their jurisprudence of their sect, payment of these taxes was a purely individual choice, a decision made according to one's conscience. In reaction to the promulgation of the law, they orchestrated a massive demonstration in Islamabad which later led them to be exempted from the mandatory tax.The taxes have not been found to have eliminated rural and urban poverty or reduced the inequalities in wealth which had become a traditional feature of Pakistani society.<ref name=talbot-278>{{cite book|last1=Talbot|first1=Ian|title=Pakistan, a Modern History|date=1998|publisher=St.Martin's Press|location=NY|page=278|quote=... the ''ushr'' and ''zakat'' taxes did not eliminate rural and urban poverty or reduce the massive inequalities in wealth which had become a traditional feature of Pakistani society.}}</ref><ref name=Salim-117>{{cite book|last1=Salim|first1=Arskal|title=Challenging the Secular State: The Islamization of Law in Modern Indonesia|date=2008|publisher=University of Hawaii Press.|pages=117\u2013119|url=https://books.google.com/?id=pnUI036m3tUC&pg=PA117&dq=zakat+pakistan#v=onepage&q=zakat%20pakistan&f=false|accessdate=3 December 2014|isbn=9780824832377}}</ref>\n\n===Riba===\n\nZia publicly stated his desire to eliminate interest on loans and securities and create an \"[[Interest-free economy]].\"<ref name=\"Islamic Studies\">{{cite book|last=Mehboob|first=Aurangzaib|title=Islamization of Economy|publisher=Islamic Studies|pages=682\u2013686|chapter-url=http://67.199.47.101/economy/islamisation%20of%20economy.pdf|accessdate=12 August 2012|chapter=Executive Initiative I|year=2002|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150120193323/http://67.199.47.101/economy/islamisation%20of%20economy.pdf|archivedate=20 January 2015}}</ref>\nZia declared that effective 1 July 1979 the affairs of the National Investment Trust, the House Building Finance Corporation, and the Investment Corporation of Pakistan were to be run on an interest-free basis through the adoption of profit-loss sharing (PLS).<ref name=\"CKILE1996: 128-9\">[[#CKILE1996|Kennedy, ''Islamization of Laws and Economy'', 1996]]: p.128-9</ref>\nOn 1 January 1980, approximately 7,000 interest-free counters were opened at all the nationalized commercial banks.<ref name=\"Islamic Studies\" />\n\nIn 1981 interest payments were to be replaced by \"profit and loss\" accounts (though profit was thought to be simply interest by another name).<ref name=jones-16-7>{{cite book|last1=Jones|first1=Owen Bennett|title=Pakistan : eye of the storm|date=2002|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven and London|pages=16\u20137|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ONZpltd6UZ8C&printsec=frontcover&dq=zia+giving+him+a+free+hand+to+ignore+internationally+accepted+human+rights+norms#v=onepage&q&f=false|isbn=978-0300101478}}</ref> The government introduced and encouraged banks to adopt financing schemes based upon ''[[murabaha]]'' and or ''[[musharaka]]''<ref name=\"CKILE1996: 128-9\" />\n\n===Land reforms===\nZia did not consider land reform or trade union activity to be part of Islamic economics.\nIn a statement addressed to the poor and working class he opined: \n<blockquote>It is not for the employers to provide ''roti, kapda, aur makaan'' (bread, clothes and homes) [a reference to a well-known slogan used by Bhutto's PPP].

It has frequently changed or threatened to change because of differences of opinion among the ruling factions. There are inconsistencies\n*Between legal norms and socially observed norms;\n*Between statutory legal norms and the norms applied in practice in the courts (e.g. Hadd is difficult to implement because confession, retraction of confession and strict standards of proof make it difficult to execute);\n*Between different formal legal norms (e.g. non-compliance with the ''Muslim Family Laws Ordinance'' is tolerated by the courts but should be strictly punished under the ''Zina Ordinance'').

Payment of the alms tax, [[Zakat]], as well as its agricultural counterpart, [[Islamic taxes#Ushr|Ushr]], were traditionally private obligations for Muslims in Pakistan. Together they generally represented 2.5% of annual household savings and served as a sort of wealth tax to be redistributed to the Muslim community's poor.<ref>Nelson, Matthew (2008) ''In the Shadow of Shari'ah.''</ref> One of the provisions of the 1973 constitution already stipulated that these taxes should be collected by the government. But [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto|Bhutto]] had made no move to implement it. In 1979, Zia decided to transform what was considered a personal duty of solidarity into a legal obligation. The \"Zakat and Ushr Ordinance\" was issued on 20 June 1980. Its urban component,''zakat'', took effect in 1981, whereas ''ushr'' did not come into effect until 1983. The system by which these taxes were previously levied was replaced by a specific agency to rationalize the collection & distribution of funds, a process that Malik describes as follows:\n\nOn the first day of the fasting month of Ramadan, the Zakat Deducting Agencies (banks,post-offices etc.) by means of deduction at source withdraw 2.5% from all saving accounts above a certain exemption limit (fixed at Rs. 1,000 in the first year of Zakat deduction, 1980). They transfer the Zakat thus collected to the Central Zakat Fund (CZF). This fund is fed also with proceeds from 'voluntary Zakat' and 'donations' and from funds of other institutions. Following certain criteria, the Zakat is then distributed among the Provincial Zakat Funds (PZFs) and the National Zakat Foundation (NZF). Following prescribed quota, the PZFs turn over funds to the Local Zakat Funds (LZFs), to other institutions, to the needy (mustaqhin) and to the National Zakat Foundation.<ref>Malik, Jamal (1996) ''Colonization of Islam''.</ref>\n\nWhile ''ushr'' is distributed in the locality where it was collected, the distribution process of the ''zakat'' shows a whole bureaucratic pyramid in action. Here again, the Islamization policy reinforced state control over religious institutions. Further evidence of this was the Tehsil/Taluka/Subdivisional and Local Committees (Removal of Chairman and Members) Rule (1981), which allowed the state to dismiss the president of a local Zakat Committee, an institution that was previously independent of the state. In 1981, ''Al Zakat'', an influential national monthly publication boasted that 250,000 persons were involved in the new system of collecting and distributing zakat funds.\nThe fiscal dimension of Zia's Islamization policy fostered a rise in sectarianism, a term that in Pakistan denotes the conflict between Sunni and Shia Muslims. As soon as Zia's plans for ''zakat'' and ''ushr'' were made public, Shia leaders objected that according to their jurisprudence of their sect, payment of these taxes was a purely individual choice, a decision made according to one's conscience. In reaction to the promulgation of the law, they orchestrated a massive demonstration in Islamabad which later led them to be exempted from the mandatory tax.The taxes have not been found to have eliminated rural and urban poverty or reduced the inequalities in wealth which had become a traditional feature of Pakistani society.<ref name=talbot-278>{{cite book|last1=Talbot|first1=Ian|title=Pakistan, a Modern History|date=1998|publisher=St.Martin's Press|location=NY|page=278|quote=... the ''ushr'' and ''zakat'' taxes did not eliminate rural and urban poverty or reduce the massive inequalities in wealth which had become a traditional feature of Pakistani society.}}</ref><ref name=Salim-117>{{cite book|last1=Salim|first1=Arskal|title=Challenging the Secular State: The Islamization of Law in Modern Indonesia|date=2008|publisher=University of Hawaii Press.|pages=117\u2013119|url=https://books.google.com/?id=pnUI036m3tUC&pg=PA117&dq=zakat+pakistan#v=onepage&q=zakat%20pakistan&f=false|accessdate=3 December 2014|isbn=9780824832377}}</ref>\n\n===Riba===\n\nZia publicly stated his desire to eliminate interest on loans and securities and create an \"[[Interest-free economy]].\"<ref name=\"Islamic Studies\">{{cite book|last=Mehboob|first=Aurangzaib|title=Islamization of Economy|publisher=Islamic Studies|pages=682\u2013686|chapter-url=http://67.199.47.101/economy/islamisation%20of%20economy.pdf|accessdate=12 August 2012|chapter=Executive Initiative I|year=2002|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150120193323/http://67.199.47.101/economy/islamisation%20of%20economy.pdf|archivedate=20 January 2015}}</ref>\nZia declared that effective 1 July 1979 the affairs of the National Investment Trust, the House Building Finance Corporation, and the Investment Corporation of Pakistan were to be run on an interest-free basis through the adoption of profit-loss sharing (PLS).<ref name=\"CKILE1996: 128-9\">[[#CKILE1996|Kennedy, ''Islamization of Laws and Economy'', 1996]]: p.128-9</ref>\nOn 1 January 1980, approximately 7,000 interest-free counters were opened at all the nationalized commercial banks.<ref name=\"Islamic Studies\" />\n\nIn 1981 interest payments were to be replaced by \"profit and loss\" accounts (though profit was thought to be simply interest by another name).<ref name=jones-16-7>{{cite book|last1=Jones|first1=Owen Bennett|title=Pakistan : eye of the storm|date=2002|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven and London|pages=16\u20137|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ONZpltd6UZ8C&printsec=frontcover&dq=zia+giving+him+a+free+hand+to+ignore+internationally+accepted+human+rights+norms#v=onepage&q&f=false|isbn=978-0300101478}}</ref> The government introduced and encouraged banks to adopt financing schemes based upon ''[[murabaha]]'' and or ''[[musharaka]]''<ref name=\"CKILE1996: 128-9\" />\n\n===Land reforms===\nZia did not consider land reform or trade union activity to be part of Islamic economics.\nIn a statement addressed to the poor and working class he opined: \n<blockquote>It is not for the employers to provide ''roti, kapda, aur makaan'' (bread, clothes and homes) [a reference to a well-known slogan used by Bhutto's PPP].

{"title_page": "Pennsylvania chocolate workers' strike, 1937", "text_new": "[[Hershey, Pennsylvania]] witnessed a six-day sit-down strike of workers at the [[Hershey Chocolate Company|Hershey Chocolate Corporation]] in 1937. The strike ended in violence, as dairy workers and loyal Hershey employees stormed the factory to force out strikers. Eventually, Hershey Corporation workers signed an agreement with the [[American Federation of Labor]] through the [[Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers' International Union|Bakery and Confectionery International Union]], becoming one of the first American candy companies to unionize.<ref>{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Andrew|title=Encyclopedia of Junk Food and Fast Food}}</ref>\n\n== Background ==\n\n=== Changes in the Hershey Corporation ===\nFounded in 1894 by [[Milton Hershey]], the Hershey Chocolate Corporation became one of the richest candy companies in existence. In its first three decades, Hershey, Pennsylvania was an idyllic company town that thrived no matter what was going on in the rest of the country. Hershey was seen as a benevolent employer, providing benefits, retirement plans, and amenities to workers before they were commonplace. All of that changed with the Great Depression and the explosion of the labor movement. \n \nBefore the [[Great Depression|Depression]], Hershey employees were accustomed to a sixty-hour work week, so when they were restricted to forty hour weeks, many had difficulty getting by on their post-Depression paychecks.<ref name=\"brenner\">{{cite book|last=Brenner|first=Joel|title=The Emperors of Chocolate|url=https://archive.org/details/emperorsofchocol00bren|url-access=registration|year=1999}}</ref> Initially, Milton Hershey could legitimately keep tight controls on hours and wages because it was required under the [[National Recovery Administration]] (NRA), but the NRA was later found unconstitutional and could no longer be enforced.\n\nFrom 1930-1936, Milton Hershey had spent more than $10 million on building up Hershey, Pennsylvania, but he reduced hours of his employees and stopped paying annual bonuses.<ref name=\"dantonio\">{{cite book|last=D'Antonio|first=Michael|title=Hershey: Milton S.

Milton Hershey built a town for his workers, attempting to cater to their material and spiritual needs, including entertainment and education. But not everyone was comfortable living in a place where everything was controlled by one man and his executives. This degree of control and entanglement with their personal lives meant that many hiring and firing decisions were made based on individual relationships and favoritism. This disturbed some employees, and made them receptive to [[Congress of Industrial Organizations|CIO]] organizers in 1937.\n\n=== The \u201cChocolate Bar-B\" ===\nIn the last weeks of 1936, a newsletter called \u201cThe Chocolate Bar-B\u201d began to circulate around the chocolate factory. The leaflet aired grievances over low wages, erratic work schedules and recent orders to speed up production.<ref name=\"dantonio\"/>{{rp|208\u2013209}} It insisted that chocolate workers did perform physically demanding labor, with deafening levels of noise and temperatures over 100 degrees.

After the meeting, several hundred Hershey employees formed a local of the United Chocolate Workers Union and within weeks several hundred factory workers had joined.<ref name=\"dantonio\"/>{{rp|211}} When the union first approached Hershey to negotiate, they were met with little resistance. The corporation reported it would raise wages to 60 cents/hour for men and 45 cents/hour for women.<ref name=\"brenner\"/>{{rp|141}}\n\nAfter the initial agreement, Hershey laid off some union organizers as part of what company president William Murrie said to be part of seasonal cutbacks.<ref name=\"nyt\">{{citation|title=SIT-ON-ROOF STRIKE SHUTS HERSHEY PLANT|newspaper=The New York Times|date=April 3, 1937}}</ref> The CIO argued that Hershey violated the promise of job security for union organizers in their March agreement. Union members met back at the firehouse on April 1, 1937 and decided the fishy lay-offs were the final straw.\n\n=== Strike! ===\nOn April 2, 1937 at eleven in the morning, union president Russell \u201cBull\u201d Behman waved a red handkerchief outside the Hershey chocolate factory and signaled the strike was on.<ref name=\"dantonio\"/>{{rp|213}} In a matter of minutes, the machines were switched off and whole buildings went silent. Some sat down at their posts, others went outside to picket, and hundreds took to the roofs of factory buildings along Chocolate Avenue.<ref name=\"nyt\"/> During lunchtime, the workers still loyal to Hershey went home. It is unclear how many actually took part in the strike\u2014organizers claim 1,200 while Hershey executives say 400. Strikers decided they would sit-down in shifts. Food would be supplied by a union kitchen, surveillance cameras would make sure Hershey\u2019s property was not damaged, and smoking was banned in sanitary areas of the factory. The CIO flag flew above the factory, replacing the traditional American flag.\n\nThe first few days of the strike seemed peaceful as strikers smiled for cameras and were optimistic about negotiations. Strikers described the sit-down as \u201cmore like a family squabble than an angry revolution\u201d.<ref name=\"off\"/> But workers were no longer dealing with Milton Hershey, instead they faced new executive William Murrie who was strongly anti-union. Murrie announced the company would not bargain until the strikers left the factory.\n\n=== Got Milk? ===\nHershey\u2019s reputation as a mostly kind corporation meant that strikers faced resistance from many fronts. The chocolate factory had three thousand workers, and the larger corporation employed nearly two thousand people in other areas of the company that wanted nothing to do with the strike.

The strike ended in violence, as dairy workers and loyal Hershey employees stormed the factory to force out strikers. Eventually, Hershey Corporation workers signed an agreement with the [[American Federation of Labor]] through the [[Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers' International Union|Bakery and Confectionery International Union]], becoming one of the first American candy companies to unionize.<ref>{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Andrew|title=Encyclopedia of Junk Food and Fast Food}}</ref>\n\n== Background ==\n\n=== Changes in the Hershey Corporation ===\nFounded in 1894 by [[Milton Hershey]], the Hershey Chocolate Corporation became one of the richest candy companies in existence. In its first three decades, Hershey, Pennsylvania was an idyllic company town that thrived no matter what was going on in the rest of the country. Hershey was seen as a benevolent employer, providing benefits, retirement plans, and amenities to workers before they were commonplace. All of that changed with the Great Depression and the explosion of the labor movement. \n \nBefore the [[Great Depression|Depression]], Hershey employees were accustomed to a sixty-hour work week, so when they were restricted to forty hour weeks, many had difficulty getting by on their post-Depression paychecks.<ref name=\"brenner\">{{cite book|last=Brenner|first=Joel|title=The Emperors of Chocolate|url=https://archive.org/details/emperorsofchocol00bren|url-access=registration|year=1999}}</ref> Initially, Milton Hershey could legitimately keep tight controls on hours and wages because it was required under the [[National Recovery Administration]] (NRA), but the NRA was later found unconstitutional and could no longer be enforced.\n\nFrom 1930-1936, Milton Hershey had spent more than $10 million on building up Hershey, Pennsylvania, but he reduced hours of his employees and stopped paying annual bonuses.<ref name=\"dantonio\">{{cite book|last=D'Antonio|first=Michael|title=Hershey: Milton S. Hershey's Extraordinary Life of Wealth, Empire, and Utopian Dreams|url=https://archive.org/details/hersheymiltonshe00dant|url-access=registration|year=2006}}</ref>{{rp|218\u2013219}} In those six years, the Hershey Chocolate Corporation made more than $37 million in after-tax profits.<ref name=\"brenner\"/>{{rp|139}}\n\n===A Company Town===\nMany Hershey employees also resented the paternalistic attitude of the company. Milton Hershey built a town for his workers, attempting to cater to their material and spiritual needs, including entertainment and education. But not everyone was comfortable living in a place where everything was controlled by one man and his executives. This degree of control and entanglement with their personal lives meant that many hiring and firing decisions were made based on individual relationships and favoritism. This disturbed some employees, and made them receptive to [[Congress of Industrial Organizations|CIO]] organizers in 1937.\n\n=== The \u201cChocolate Bar-B\" ===\nIn the last weeks of 1936, a newsletter called \u201cThe Chocolate Bar-B\u201d began to circulate around the chocolate factory. The leaflet aired grievances over low wages, erratic work schedules and recent orders to speed up production.<ref name=\"dantonio\"/>{{rp|208\u2013209}} It insisted that chocolate workers did perform physically demanding labor, with deafening levels of noise and temperatures over 100 degrees. It scolded the \u201cbig bosses\u201d, Murrie and Hershey, for their \u201chigh salaries and slave-driving methods\u201d.<ref name=\"off\">{{cite book|last=Off|first=Carol|title=Bitter Chocolate: Investigating the Dark Side of the World's Most Seductive Sweet|year=2006|page=91}}</ref> The newsletter was signed by the Communist Party of Hershey, PA and strongly advised the workers to unionize.\n\n== Events of the Strike ==\n\n=== CIO Comes to Town ===\nIn January 1937, Members of the CIO held a secret meeting at a firehouse in [[Palmyra, PA]]. After the meeting, several hundred Hershey employees formed a local of the United Chocolate Workers Union and within weeks several hundred factory workers had joined.<ref name=\"dantonio\"/>{{rp|211}} When the union first approached Hershey to negotiate, they were met with little resistance. The corporation reported it would raise wages to 60 cents/hour for men and 45 cents/hour for women.<ref name=\"brenner\"/>{{rp|141}}\n\nAfter the initial agreement, Hershey laid off some union organizers as part of what company president William Murrie said to be part of seasonal cutbacks.<ref name=\"nyt\">{{citation|title=SIT-ON-ROOF STRIKE SHUTS HERSHEY PLANT|newspaper=The New York Times|date=April 3, 1937}}</ref> The CIO argued that Hershey violated the promise of job security for union organizers in their March agreement. Union members met back at the firehouse on April 1, 1937 and decided the fishy lay-offs were the final straw.\n\n=== Strike! ===\nOn April 2, 1937 at eleven in the morning, union president Russell \u201cBull\u201d Behman waved a red handkerchief outside the Hershey chocolate factory and signaled the strike was on.<ref name=\"dantonio\"/>{{rp|213}} In a matter of minutes, the machines were switched off and whole buildings went silent. Some sat down at their posts, others went outside to picket, and hundreds took to the roofs of factory buildings along Chocolate Avenue.<ref name=\"nyt\"/> During lunchtime, the workers still loyal to Hershey went home. It is unclear how many actually took part in the strike\u2014organizers claim 1,200 while Hershey executives say 400. Strikers decided they would sit-down in shifts. Food would be supplied by a union kitchen, surveillance cameras would make sure Hershey\u2019s property was not damaged, and smoking was banned in sanitary areas of the factory. The CIO flag flew above the factory, replacing the traditional American flag.\n\nThe first few days of the strike seemed peaceful as strikers smiled for cameras and were optimistic about negotiations. Strikers described the sit-down as \u201cmore like a family squabble than an angry revolution\u201d.<ref name=\"off\"/> But workers were no longer dealing with Milton Hershey, instead they faced new executive William Murrie who was strongly anti-union. Murrie announced the company would not bargain until the strikers left the factory.\n\n=== Got Milk? ===\nHershey\u2019s reputation as a mostly kind corporation meant that strikers faced resistance from many fronts. The chocolate factory had three thousand workers, and the larger corporation employed nearly two thousand people in other areas of the company that wanted nothing to do with the strike. The most resistance came from thousands of dairy farmers from surrounding areas who relied on selling their milk to the Hershey factory. They were losing 800,000 pounds of milk per day\u2014enough to supply a city of a million people.<ref name=\"brenner\"/>{{rp|140}} These dairy farmers were natural allies to the anti-union groups because they were losing money each day the factory stayed closed.\n\nOn Monday April 5, the fourth day of the strike, dairy farmers met with strikers to discuss lost milk sales.

While venturing into the woods to fetch a stray arrow, Merida encounters a [[will-o'-the-wisp]]. Soon afterward, Mor'du, a huge demon bear, attacks the family. Merida flees on horseback with Elinor, while Fergus and his men fend off Mor'du, though the fight costs him one of his legs.\n\nTen years later, Merida, now a big sister to identical triplets\u2014Harris, Hubert, and Hamish, discovers that she is to be betrothed to the son of one of her father's allies. Elinor explains that failure to consent to the betrothal could harm Dunbroch, reminding Merida of a legend of a prince whose pride and refusal to follow his father's wishes destroyed his kingdom.\n\nThe allied clan chieftains and their first-born sons arrive to compete in the [[Highland games]] for Merida's hand in marriage. Merida twists the rules, announcing that as her own clan's firstborn she is eligible to compete for her own hand. She easily bests her suitors in an archery contest, shaming the other clans, and after a heated argument with Elinor, runs away into the forest. Wisps appear, leading her to the hut of an elderly witch. Merida bargains for a spell to change her fate, and the witch gives her an enchanted cake.\n\nWhen Merida gives Elinor the cake, it transforms her into a bear, unable to speak but still retaining most of her human consciousness. Merida returns to the witch's cottage with Elinor, only to find it deserted, and discovers a message from the witch: unless Merida is able to \"mend the bond torn by pride\" before the second sunrise, the spell will become permanent. Merida and Elinor are led by the wisps to ancient ruins, where they encounter Mor'du. Realizing that Mor'du was the prince in the legend, Merida vows that she will not let the same thing happen to her mother, and concludes she needs to repair the family tapestry she damaged during their argument.\n\nThey return to the castle to find the clans on the verge of war. Merida intends to relent and declare herself ready to choose a suitor as tradition demands, but Elinor prompts her instead to insist that the firstborns should be allowed to marry in their own time to whomever they choose. The clans agree, breaking tradition but renewing and strengthening their alliance.\n\nMerida sneaks into the tapestry room with Elinor. Elinor, who is losing her humanity, attacks Fergus, but suddenly regains her composure and flees the castle. Mistaking the queen for Mor'du and unable to listen to Merida, Fergus pursues the bear with the other clans, locking Merida in the castle. Merida escapes with the assistance of her brothers, who have also eaten the enchanted cake. They are now bear cubs. Merida repairs the tapestry and rides out after her father. Fergus and the clans capture Elinor, but Merida intervenes and stops her father before Mor'du arrives. Mor'du batters the clan warriors and targets Merida, but Elinor intercedes, holding off Mor'du and causing him to be crushed by a falling [[menhir]]. This releases the [[spirit]] of the prince, who silently thanks Merida for freeing him. Merida covers her mother in the repaired tapestry, but she remains a bear. As the sun rises for the second time, Merida realizes the mistakes she has made and reconciles with Elinor, unknowingly fulfilling the true meaning of the witch's message and reversing the spell's effects.\n\nWith Mor'du gone, Merida and Elinor work together on a new tapestry when they are called to the docks to bid farewell to the other clans, and ride their horses.\n<!-- NOTE: Please do not add the post-credits scene to the plot summary.

The orchestra was conducted by [[James Shearman]]. To bring some of Scotland's native flavor to the music, Doyle used traditional Celtic instruments such as [[bagpipes]], a solo [[fiddle]], [[Cl\u00e0rsach|Celtic harps]], flutes and the [[bodhr\u00e1n]], with an electronically treated [[Hammered dulcimer|dulcimer]] and [[cimbalom]] to give it a more contemporary feel.  \"I employed many classic Scottish dance rhythms such as [[Reel (dance)|reels]], [[jig]]s, and [[Strathspey (dance)|strathspeys]], which not only serve the action but keep it authentic,\" said Doyle.<ref name=\"Soundtrack\">{{cite press release|title=Sounds Of The Highlands; Disney-Pixar's \"Brave\" Transports Moviegoers to Ancient Scotland with Oscar-Nominated Composer Patrick Doyle, Plus Performers Julie Fowlis and Birdy (with Mumford & Sons)|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sounds-of-the-highlands-disney-pixars-brave-transports-moviegoers-to-ancient-scotland-with-oscar-nominated-composer-patrick-doyle-plus-performers-julie-fowlis-and-birdy-with-mumford--sons-152256415.html|accessdate=May 22, 2012|publisher=Walt Disney Records|date=May 21, 2012}}</ref> As part of his research, he spent time in the Hebrides studying \"unaccompanied [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]] [[Hymnbooks of the Church of Scotland#Scots Metrical Psalter .281650.29|psalm singing]].\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Cornwell|first=Tim|title=Scotland's Pixar tale hits the right note|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/Scotland39s-Pixar-tale-hits-the.6793996.jp?articlepage=1|accessdate=September 6, 2011|newspaper=[[The Scotsman]]|date=July 1, 2011}}</ref>\n\nDoyle also composed several songs for the film. The lullaby duet between characters Princess Merida and Queen Elinor entitled \"A Mhaighdean Uasal Bhan (Noble Maiden Fair)\" appears on three occasions in different variations within the fabric of the score, and uniquely includes Gaelic vocals by Emma Thompson and Peigi Barker, the first Disney film with music featuring the language.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} The drinking song \"Song of Mor'du\" (lyrics by Doyle and Steve Purcell) sung by [[Billy Connolly]], Scott Davies, [[Patrick Doyle]], Gordon Neville, [[Alex Norton]] and Carey Wilson, features a rich variety of words, sung authentically in [[Scots (language)|Scots]], which is distinct from Scottish Gaelic. (Scots being a Germanic language, while Scottish Gaelic is Celtic.)\n\nIn addition to Doyle's music, the film features three other original songs; \"Learn Me Right\" written by [[Mumford & Sons]] and performed with [[Birdy (singer)|Birdy]], \"Touch the Sky\" (music by Alex Mandel, lyrics by Mark Andrews & Mandel) and \"Into the Open Air\" (music and lyrics by Alex Mandel). Both \"Touch the Sky\" and \"Into the Open Air\" were performed by [[Julie Fowlis]], as Merida's off-screen musical thoughts. These two tracks were produced by composer and arranger Jim Sutherland, who is also featured as a performer.\n\nAlong with introducing Doyle to a number of specialist Celtic musicians who feature in the score, Sutherland was responsible for discovering the young Gaelic singer Peigi Barker; the voice of Young Merida.\n\n[[Walt Disney Records]] released the soundtrack on both CD album and digital download on June 19, 2012.<ref>{{cite web|title=Amazon.com: Brave: Various Artists, Patrick Doyle, James Shearman: Music|url=https://www.amazon.com/Brave-Various-Artists/dp/B007XSFKAW| publisher = [[Amazon.com]] |accessdate = July 6, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Tartans===\n[[File:DunBroch tartan.jpg|thumb|Clan DunBroch tartan, [[Scottish Tartans Authority|STA]] 10641]]\n\nPixar created three original [[tartan]] patterns for the film for three of the four clans \u2013 DunBroch, Dingwall, and MacGuffin. (Clan Macintosh wears a red tartan similar to the nonfictional [[Clan Mackintosh]].)\n\n[[The Walt Disney Company]] registered the Clan DunBroch tartan with the official [[Scottish Register of Tartans]] upon release of the film. The tartan consists of ocean blue for the [[North Sea]], subdued scarlet for bloodshed during the clan wars, deep green for the [[Scottish Highlands]], navy blue for the eventual unity of the four clans, and gray for the Scottish people. In selecting the color scheme, Pixar took historical considerations, stating that \"[t]here was a concerted effort to use hues that were indicative of the less saturated dyeing techniques [used] during the [[Scotland in the Early Middle Ages|ancient period]] in which the fantasy film is set.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tartanregister.gov.uk/tartanDetails.aspx?ref=10641|title=Tartan Details - The Scottish Register of Tartans|first=National Records of|last=Scotland|accessdate=June 14, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe registration was celebrated at the film's British premiere in [[Edinburgh]], where Scottish First Minister [[Alex Salmond]] presented a certificate to director Mark Andrews. However, Member of the Scottish Parliament [[Alex Johnstone]] criticized the registration (as well as other fiction-based entries such as one for [[Peter Rabbit]]) as \"shallow and irreverent.\" Mr. Johnstone contended that the 2008 legislation that created The Scottish Register of Tartans was intended to prevent such entries and protect Scotland's heritage.<ref>\"[http://www.deadlinenews.co.uk/2013/01/03/scottish-register-of-tartans-criticised-over-approving-disney-designs/ Scottish Register of Tartans criticized after approving Disney designs]\".

It was directed by [[Mark Andrews (filmmaker)|Mark Andrews]] and [[Brenda Chapman]] and co-directed by [[Steve Purcell]]. The story is by Chapman, with the screenplay by Andrews, Purcell, Chapman and [[Irene Mecchi]]. The film was produced by [[Katherine Sarafian]], with [[John Lasseter]], [[Andrew Stanton]], and [[Pete Docter]] as executive producers. The film's voice cast features [[Kelly Macdonald]], [[Billy Connolly]], [[Emma Thompson]], [[Julie Walters]], [[Robbie Coltrane]], [[Kevin McKidd]], and [[Craig Ferguson]]. Set in the [[Scottish Highlands]], the film tells the story of a princess named [[Merida (Disney)|Merida]] who defies an age-old custom, causing chaos in the kingdom by expressing the desire not to be betrothed. Merida is the first, and currently, only Disney princess created by Pixar. The film is also dedicated to [[Steve Jobs]], who died before the film's release.\n\nChapman drew inspiration for the film's story from her relationship with her own daughter. Co-directing with Mark Andrews, Chapman became Pixar's first female director of a feature-length film.<ref name=\"Entertainment Weekly\">{{cite web|url=http://insidemovies.ew.com/2012/08/15/brave-director-brenda-chapman-breaks-silence-getting-taken-off-film-heartbreaking-devastating-distressing/|title='Brave' director Brenda Chapman breaks silence: Getting taken off film 'heartbreaking... devastating... distressing'|date=August 15, 2012}}</ref> To create the most complex visuals possible, Pixar completely rewrote their animation system for the first time in 25 years.<ref>[[Joel Stein|Stein, Joel]] (March 5, 2012).

While venturing into the woods to fetch a stray arrow, Merida encounters a [[will-o'-the-wisp]]. Soon afterward, Mor'du, a huge demon bear, attacks the family. Merida flees on horseback with Elinor, while Fergus and his men fend off Mor'du, though the fight costs him one of his legs.\n\nTen years later, Merida, now a big sister to identical triplets\u2014Harris, Hubert, and Hamish, discovers that she is to be betrothed to the son of one of her father's allies. Elinor explains that failure to consent to the betrothal could harm Dunbroch, reminding Merida of a legend of a prince whose pride and refusal to follow his father's wishes destroyed his kingdom.\n\nThe allied clan chieftains and their first-born sons arrive to compete in the [[Highland games]] for Merida's hand in marriage. Merida twists the rules, announcing that as her own clan's firstborn she is eligible to compete for her own hand. She easily bests her suitors in an archery contest, shaming the other clans, and after a heated argument with Elinor, runs away into the forest. Wisps appear, leading her to the hut of an elderly witch. Merida bargains for a spell to change her fate, and the witch gives her an enchanted cake.\n\nWhen Merida gives Elinor the cake, it transforms her into a bear, unable to speak but still retaining most of her human consciousness. Merida returns to the witch's cottage with Elinor, only to find it deserted, and discovers a message from the witch: unless Merida is able to \"mend the bond torn by pride\" before the second sunrise, the spell will become permanent. Merida and Elinor are led by the wisps to ancient ruins, where they encounter Mor'du. Realizing that Mor'du was the prince in the legend, Merida vows that she will not let the same thing happen to her mother, and concludes she needs to repair the family tapestry she damaged during their argument.\n\nThey return to the castle to find the clans on the verge of war. Merida intends to relent and declare herself ready to choose a suitor as tradition demands, but Elinor prompts her instead to insist that the firstborns should be allowed to marry in their own time to whomever they choose. The clans agree, breaking tradition but renewing and strengthening their alliance.\n\nMerida sneaks into the tapestry room with Elinor. Elinor, who is losing her humanity, attacks Fergus, but suddenly regains her composure and flees the castle. Mistaking the queen for Mor'du and unable to listen to Merida, Fergus pursues the bear with the other clans, locking Merida in the castle. Merida escapes with the assistance of her brothers, who have also eaten the enchanted cake. They are now bear cubs. Merida repairs the tapestry and rides out after her father. Fergus and the clans capture Elinor, but Merida intervenes and stops her father before Mor'du arrives. Mor'du batters the clan warriors and targets Merida, but Elinor intercedes, holding off Mor'du and causing him to be crushed by a falling [[menhir]]. This releases the [[spirit]] of the prince, who silently thanks Merida for freeing him. Merida covers her mother in the repaired tapestry, but she remains a bear. As the sun rises for the second time, Merida realizes the mistakes she has made and reconciles with Elinor, unknowingly fulfilling the true meaning of the witch's message and reversing the spell's effects.\n\nWith Mor'du gone, Merida and Elinor work together on a new tapestry when they are called to the docks to bid farewell to the other clans, and ride their horses.\n<!-- NOTE: Please do not add the post-credits scene to the plot summary.

The orchestra was conducted by [[James Shearman]]. To bring some of Scotland's native flavor to the music, Doyle used traditional Celtic instruments such as [[bagpipes]], a solo [[fiddle]], [[Cl\u00e0rsach|Celtic harps]], flutes and the [[bodhr\u00e1n]], with an electronically treated [[Hammered dulcimer|dulcimer]] and [[cimbalom]] to give it a more contemporary feel.  \"I employed many classic Scottish dance rhythms such as [[Reel (dance)|reels]], [[jig]]s, and [[Strathspey (dance)|strathspeys]], which not only serve the action but keep it authentic,\" said Doyle.<ref name=\"Soundtrack\">{{cite press release|title=Sounds Of The Highlands; Disney-Pixar's \"Brave\" Transports Moviegoers to Ancient Scotland with Oscar-Nominated Composer Patrick Doyle, Plus Performers Julie Fowlis and Birdy (with Mumford & Sons)|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sounds-of-the-highlands-disney-pixars-brave-transports-moviegoers-to-ancient-scotland-with-oscar-nominated-composer-patrick-doyle-plus-performers-julie-fowlis-and-birdy-with-mumford--sons-152256415.html|accessdate=May 22, 2012|publisher=Walt Disney Records|date=May 21, 2012}}</ref> As part of his research, he spent time in the Hebrides studying \"unaccompanied [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]] [[Hymnbooks of the Church of Scotland#Scots Metrical Psalter .281650.29|psalm singing]].\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Cornwell|first=Tim|title=Scotland's Pixar tale hits the right note|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/Scotland39s-Pixar-tale-hits-the.6793996.jp?articlepage=1|accessdate=September 6, 2011|newspaper=[[The Scotsman]]|date=July 1, 2011}}</ref>\n\nDoyle also composed several songs for the film. The lullaby duet between characters Princess Merida and Queen Elinor entitled \"A Mhaighdean Uasal Bhan (Noble Maiden Fair)\" appears on three occasions in different variations within the fabric of the score, and uniquely includes Gaelic vocals by Emma Thompson and Peigi Barker, the first Disney film with music featuring the language.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} The drinking song \"Song of Mor'du\" (lyrics by Doyle and Steve Purcell) sung by [[Billy Connolly]], Scott Davies, [[Patrick Doyle]], Gordon Neville, [[Alex Norton]] and Carey Wilson, features a rich variety of words, sung authentically in [[Scots (language)|Scots]], which is distinct from Scottish Gaelic. (Scots being a Germanic language, while Scottish Gaelic is Celtic.)\n\nIn addition to Doyle's music, the film features three other original songs; \"Learn Me Right\" written by [[Mumford & Sons]] and performed with [[Birdy (singer)|Birdy]], \"Touch the Sky\" (music by Alex Mandel, lyrics by Mark Andrews & Mandel) and \"Into the Open Air\" (music and lyrics by Alex Mandel). Both \"Touch the Sky\" and \"Into the Open Air\" were performed by [[Julie Fowlis]], as Merida's off-screen musical thoughts. These two tracks were produced by composer and arranger Jim Sutherland, who is also featured as a performer.\n\nAlong with introducing Doyle to a number of specialist Celtic musicians who feature in the score, Sutherland was responsible for discovering the young Gaelic singer Peigi Barker; the voice of Young Merida.\n\n[[Walt Disney Records]] released the soundtrack on both CD album and digital download on June 19, 2012.<ref>{{cite web|title=Amazon.com: Brave: Various Artists, Patrick Doyle, James Shearman: Music|url=https://www.amazon.com/Brave-Various-Artists/dp/B007XSFKAW| publisher = [[Amazon.com]] |accessdate = July 6, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Tartans===\n[[File:DunBroch tartan.jpg|thumb|Clan DunBroch tartan, [[Scottish Tartans Authority|STA]] 10641]]\n\nPixar created three original [[tartan]] patterns for the film for three of the four clans \u2013 DunBroch, Dingwall, and MacGuffin.

The main structure is a stone [[ringfort]], thought to have been built by the [[Northern U\u00ed N\u00e9ill]], in the sixth or seventh century [[Common Era|CE]];<ref>Bartlett, Thomas. ''A Military History of Ireland''. p.37</ref> although there is evidence that the site had been in use before the fort was built. It has been identified as the seat of the [[Kings of Ailech|Kingdom of Ailech]] and one of the [[Royal sites of Ireland|royal sites]] of [[Gaelic Ireland]]. The wall is about {{convert|4.5|m|ft}} thick and {{convert|5|m|ft}} high. Inside it has three terraces, which are linked by steps, and two long passages within it. Originally, there would have been buildings inside the ringfort.<!--can we add more info about these buildings?--> Just outside it are the remains of a [[water well|well]] and a [[tumulus]].\n\nBy the 12th century, the Kingdom of Ailech had become embattled and lost a fair amount of territory to the [[Norman invasion of Ireland|invading Normans]]. According to Irish literature, the ringfort was mostly destroyed by [[Muirchertach Ua Briain]], King of Munster, in 1101. Substantial restoration work was carried out in 1870. Today, the site is an [[National monuments of Ireland|Irish National Monument]] and a tourist attraction.\n[[File:Grianan_of_Aileach_scenic_birds_eye_view.png|thumb|Grianan of Aileach fort, [[bird's-eye view]]]]\n[[File:An Grianan fort at sunset 2.jpg|thumb|An Grianan fort at sunset]]\n[[File:A stunning sunset above the fort.jpg|thumb|Sunset over the fort]]\n\n==Description and interpretation==\n[[File:Journal of the Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland (1915) (14779372521).jpg|thumb|Plan of the Grian\u00e1n]]\nThe Grian\u00e1n is located on the western edge of a small group of hills that lie between the upper reaches of [[Lough Swilly]] and [[Lough Foyle]]. Although the hill is comparatively not that high, the summit dominates the neighbouring counties of [[County Londonderry|Londonderry]], [[County Donegal|Donegal]] and [[County Tyrone|Tyrone]]. Located at the edge of the [[Inishowen]] peninsula, it is {{convert|11.25|km|mi|0}} northwest of the ecclesiastical site of [[Derry]]. The histories of the sites are closely linked. There is much legend and historical material related to the Grian\u00e1n of Aileach. The [[Irish annals]] record its destruction in 1101. The main monument on the hill is a stone [[wikt:caiseal|cashel]], restored in the nineteenth century, but probably built in the eighth century CE. The summit's use as an area of settlement may go back much further. A [[tumulus]] at the Grian\u00e1n may date back to the [[Neolithic]] age. A covered well was found near the cashel in the early nineteenth century.\n[[Image:Grainan of aileach.jpg|thumb|right|Interior view of ''Grianan of Aileach'']]\n[[Image:Grianan of Aileach view.Jpg|thumb|right|View from ''Grianan of Aileach'']]\n<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Greenan.JPG|180px|right|thumb|Photographed in 2007 from the air (www.gordondunn.co.uk)]] -->\n[[George Petrie (artist)|George Petrie]] first surveyed the Grian\u00e1n of Aileach in the 1830s.  At this time the cashel was nothing more than a mere ruin. He gives a description of the hill and the monument. The eastern ascent of the hill is described as gradual but within {{convert|30|m}} of the top, it terminated in a circular apex. An ancient road between two ledges of natural rock led to the summit. The cashel was surrounded by three concentric ramparts. Petrie suggests that, in the fashion of other monuments of this type such as [[Navan Fort|Emania]], the whole hill may have been enclosed by many other ramparts. There is no physical or historical evidence for this. The ramparts that remained were made of earth and stone and follow the natural form of the hill with an irregular circular pattern. They ascend above each other creating levelled terraces. The circular apex of the hill within the outermost enclosure contains about {{convert|2.2|ha|acre}}, within the second about  {{convert|1.6|ha|acre}} and within the third about {{convert|4|ha|acre}}. Currently, the innermost bank is very low, worn and heather-covered but traceable for almost its entire circuit.  The other two banks are in a similar state but are untraceable for long sections. Between the inner most rampart and the cashel, the road dwindles in its width and curves slightly to the right. This \"path\" was strengthened on either side by walls. At the time of the survey only the foundation stones of these walls remained. Petrie's plan of the site shows a line of stones leading up to the entrance. These are now gone.\n\nThe ruins of the cashel itself are described as being a circular wall enclosing an area of {{convert|23.6|m|}}  in diameter. The wall had a height of {{convert|1.8|m}} with a breadth varying from {{convert|4.6|m}} to {{convert|3.5|m}}. While not perpendicular, it had an inclination inwards indicating its similarity to most other Irish stone forts.  Petrie suggests that it was probably originally between twice and four times as high as it was when he surveyed it. {{convert|1.5|m}} up on the interior side of the wall, the thickness was {{convert|0.76|m}} due to the presence of terracing. The terrace is reached by flights of steps on either side of the entrance gateway. Fallen stones had covered any other existing stairs. Petrie suggests that there were originally three or four such terraces ascending to the top of the wall.  On each side of the entranceway, there are \"galleries\" within the wall. Their precise purpose is not clear and they do not connect with the entrance. These two wall-passages, one on the south and another from the northeast run towards the gateway, but stop short. Near the north end of the south passage is a small recess in its west wall. At the south end of the north passage there is a seat-stone.\n\n[[Image:Grianan of Aileach Wall Stones.jpg|thumb|Grianan Ailligh wall stones of [[mica schist]].]]\n[[Image:Grianan1878.jpg|thumb|right|The official re-opening of ''Grianan Aileach'' in 1878 following the reconstruction of Dr. Walter Bernard.]]\nThe current hillfort, after the restoration of 1874\u20131878, is substantially different but much of the old structure remains intact. During the restoration, it was found that parts of the original drystone masonry had been preserved under the collapse.  The workers marked, in tar, the undisturbed portions of the cashel and used the collapsed stone to build on this foundation. They supplemented these with other stones from the area to replace those 'removed by King Murdoch O'Brien in 1101'.  The internal diameters of the cashel are 23.6 metres north to south and {{convert|23.2|m}} east to west. The lintel-covered entrance is {{convert|4.65|m}} long, {{convert|1.12|m}} wide and {{convert|1.86|m}} metres high. Before the restoration, the gateway's lintel was not in place. It was{{convert|1.3|m}} wide and {{convert|1.2|m}} high. It leads into the fort from the east. Slight recesses on either side of the entrance way have been filled in.  They were probably to allow double leaves of an original doorway to fold flush against the wall.  The interior rises in three terraces accessible by stairways which are previously mentioned. The outer wall is a dry-stone construction. On each side of the entranceway, there are \"galleries\" within the wall. Their precise purpose is not clear and they do not connect with the entrance. These two wall-passages, one on the south and another from the northeast run towards the gateway, but stop short. The south wall passage entrance is {{convert|45|cm}} wide, {{convert|69|cm}} high and {{convert|1.4|m}} long. It turns through a right angle where it becomes {{convert|50|cm}} wide,{{convert|85|cm}} high and {{convert|20.4|m}} long. Near the north end there is a recess on the west side {{convert|50|cm}} wide, {{convert|1|m}} and {{convert|75|cm}} deep. The northeast gallery entrance is {{convert|65|cm}} wide, {{convert|97|cm}} high and {{convert|1.55|m}} long. It meets the main part of the passage in a T-junction. To the north, the passage is{{convert|70|cm}} wide, {{convert|1.3|m}} high and {{convert|2.5|m}} long. To the south, the passage is {{convert|60|cm}} wide, {{convert|1.4|m}} high and {{convert|8.6|m}} long.  Near the north of end of the south passage is a small recess in its west wall. At the south end of the north passage there is a seat-stone. The interior of the cashel is fairly level but Petrie recorded the remains of a small oblong church measuring {{convert|5|m}} by {{convert|4.3|m}}. The walls were {{convert|61|cm}} thick and not more than {{convert|62|cm}} high. The structure was constructed of mortar but nothing remains of it today. A drain runs through the cashel wall at ground level on the northwest side. It leads from a midden in the western side of the enclosure that was {{convert|1.7|m}} in diameter and one foot deep.\n[[Image:Well of St Patrick Grianan Ailligh.JPG|thumb|St. Patrick's Well south of the Grian\u00e1n of Aileach.]]\n\nThere are many clues that the Grian\u00e1n of Aileach is a multi-period site.  Brian Lacy suggests that the earthen banks surrounding the fort probably represent the defences of a hillfort of the late Bronze Age or Iron Age. Between the two outer banks on the south side of the hill, is the formerly covered spring well which is dedicated to St. Patrick.  Petrie describes the tumulus, between the second and third wall, as being a small mound surrounded by a circle of ten stones. These stones were laid horizontally and converged towards the centre. In Petrie's time, the mound had been excavated but nothing to explain its meaning was discovered.  It was subsequently destroyed but its former position is marked by a heap of broken stones.\n\nDuring the excavation work of the 1870s, Bernard documented the discovery of many artefacts. Behind a niche in the doorway, a large stone {{convert|40|cm}} wide was found. It had a round hole in the centre, 7.6 centimetres (3&nbsp;in) deep and 3.8 centimetres (1.5&nbsp;in) in diameter. A rotten piece of wood was found in the hole. Bernard was unable to decipher its use suggesting only that it could have been a sundial.\n\nBernard discovered many animal bones including sheep, cattle, goats and birds. He found stone items including \"sling-stones\", \"warrior's clubs\" and a \"sugar-loaf-shaped stone with a well-cut base\" {{convert|25|cm|0}} long, {{convert|38|cm}} round base, {{convert|36|cm}} round centre and {{convert|25|cm|0}} round top.  The most interesting stone object was \"a slab of [[sandstone]], chequered into thirty-six squares\", which Lacy believed to be some kind of gaming board. Among the miscellaneous items found were a plough socket, an iron ring, some coins and a bead.\n\n==Morphology==\nThe Grian\u00e1n of Aileach, at its broadest description, is a ringfort. More precisely it is a [[multivallate]] [[wikt:caiseal|cashel]] [[hillfort]].\n\n[[File:An Grianan fort at sunset.jpg|thumb|A Grianan fort at sunset from above]]\n\nA ring fort can be described as a space, usually circular, surrounded by a bank and ditch or simply a rampart of stone. The bank is generally built by piling up inside the fosse the material obtained digging the latter. Ringforts vary considerably in size and style. In more elaborately defended examples, such as Aileach, the defences take up a much greater area than the enclosure itself.\n\nMatthew Stout gives many examples of why the people who built these structures chose a circular formation.  First of all, they had strategic advantages. Circular sites allowed for a broad perspective of the surrounding area and allowed the maximum area to be enclosed relative to the bank constructed. He also comes up with some much more metaphysical theories. He suggests that a circular formation linked the site and its occupants with the circular burial mounds of their ancestors. About a third of all Irish hillforts have mounds or cairns within them.  The Aileach is no exception. He also puts forward the idea that a circular form was favoured because corners could act as a dwelling-place of evil spirits. He bases these claims on [[ethnographic]] comparisons.{{Vague|date=November 2018}} {{Citation needed|reason=Where does he claim this? |date=November 2018}}\n\nRingforts housed families of varying degrees of wealth, so that some of them are more impressive than others. Ringforts do not normally occupy dominant or commanding positions. The only exception to this are the ringforts built in areas of bad drainage where high places are the only suitable spots for habitation.  Raftery names three monuments which he finds hard to categorise as being either a ringfort or a hillfort: Cahirciveen; Carraig Aille; and Lough Gur.  While the places where they sit are areas of natural defence, they may have been built there for drainage purposes. The buildings themselves are not militaristic or defensive in themselves. They were probably family homesteads. The defining characteristic of hillforts is an inbuilt defensive nature.\n\nTherefore, hillforts as a subcategory of the ringfort are defined by their location and style of construction. Hillfort consist of \u2018large hilltop areas on which the summit is enclosed by one (univallate) or multiple ramparts (multivallate) of earth or stone\u2019.  A good example would be [[D\u00fan Aengus]] on [[Inishmore]]. Its defensive nature is explicit due to the system of stone slabs, known as [[chevaux de frise]], planted into the ground outside the fort structure itself.\n\nThe Grian\u00e1n of Aileach, as described in the introductory section, is encircled by three enclosures and is therefore trivallate. The actual living space of ringforts often forms less than 60% of the total monument area.  Contemporary law tracts described a king's principal dwelling to have been a [[univallate]] ringfort.  Increasing a site's defences without a corresponding increase in its functional area demonstrates either a greater need for defence or a display of status. Therefore, a ring fort with two ramparts (bivallate) acts a status symbol. The rarity of trivallate hillforts, such as that at the Grian\u00e1n, shows the importance and status of its occupants rather a need for defence.\n\nStout gives several examples to indicate their symbolic importance simply due to their impracticality as defensive structures.  In general, they were little more than fences to prevent stock from straying and to protect against wild animals.  As siege tools, they were useless. If anything they were built to repel cattle raids.This might not be the case with the Grian\u00e1n of Aileach\n\nWhile the original structure for which the ramparts were built does not exist any more, the cashel of Aileach, while formidable, was probably designed with less of a defensive function in mind but rather it was built as a symbol of royal power. Stone structures appear both eternal and immovable. The cashel was built on this site for the panoramic view rather than for defence. This could be seen as changing the visual emphasis of the ramparts from being defensive terraces to enclosures of royal power and influence.\n\nHillforts are known throughout western Europe but Irish hillforts were not as well developed and never attained the standard of the so-called Celtic [[Oppida]] of [[Continental Europe]] and Britain.  They vary in size but are of a communal rather than single-family residence. Cashels (stone-built ringforts) tend to be much smaller than earthen examples. The average earthen ringfort has an internal diameter of 22 metres in south Donegal; cashels in the same area have an average internal diameter of 20 metres.  The Grian\u00e1n of Aileach, with an average internal diameter of 23.4 metres is larger than the latter and therefore this must be an indication of the wealth and importance of its inhabitants and perhaps it is also an indication of the size of its occupant population. Lacy suggests that the innovative nature of the stone fort of Aileach must have been an unusual site when it was first constructed.  The names Garvan, Frigru/ Rigriu are found in many Irish authorities to be the names of the builders of Aileach.  These characters are linked to the [[Formorians]] and therefore may be nothing more than mythological creations. Lacy believes that the builder may have been [[\u00c1ed Oirdnide]], the victor at the battle of Clo\u00edteach.\n\n==Chronology==\n[[File:Grianan_of_Aileach_scenic_view_01.png|thumb|Grianan of Aileach fort sits on a hilltop in the Inishowen peninsula]]\n\nIt is widely accepted that most ringforts date from the [[Early Christian]] period.  Finds from [[ringforts]] typically include items which date from the second half of the first millennium: a hand-made, bucket shaped pottery style called 'Souterrain Ware', which uses local clays and can be decorated or undecorated; glass beads; bone, bronze and iron pins; and artefacts of bone and metalwork.  The artefacts, which Dr. Bernard found during his excavation of the cashel interior, seem to correspond to the above list of typical items. Indeed, in a recent publication, Brian Lacy comes up with an exact date for its construction which corresponds with this period.  He argues that Aileach is the name of a specific site in antiquity and also the name of the Cen\u00e9l nE\u00f3gain 'homeland' kingdom of Inis Eogian, derived from the place now known as Elaghmore (Aileach M\u00f3r) in County Londonderry.  After the decisive battle of Clo\u00edtech in 789, when the Cen\u00e9l nE\u00f3gain won total control of the over-kingdom of the northern U\u00ed N\u00e9ill, the successful kings relocated to the Grian\u00e1n, building it inside the pre-existing prehistoric hillfort as a visual symbol of their new mastery of all the landscape visible from that commanding view. Stout comes to the conclusion that the majority of Ireland's ringforts were occupied and constructed during a three hundred-year period from the beginning of the seventh century to the end of the ninth century AD.\n\nLacy concludes that Aileach was inhabited by the northern Ui N\u00e9ill dynasty from 789 to about 1050.  This was a period when many of the local kings in Ireland were moving to the towns founded by the Vikings or into more important ecclesiastical sites which by this time seemed to have been functioning as towns following the Vikings' model.\n\n==Distribution==\nBased on the morphology of hillforts, Raftery estimates that there are forty hillforts in Ireland.  However, Lacy suggests that there are fifty forts remaining in Ireland.  Multivallate hillforts are suggested to be confined to the West and South of the country; [[univallate]] forts are to be found in the north and east. The Grian\u00e1n of Aileach is seen as an exception to this pattern.  Raftery suggests that this simple division of distribution might be more blurred after further hillfort study and discovery.<!--Need to update with information from the Hillforts Atlas Project-->\n\nThe distribution of ringforts, in general, is much wider although we are a long way from knowing the exact number which still survive. Ringfort distribution is not even. Areas of low ringfort density correspond to intensely tilled, highly-[[Normans|Normanised]] areas.  The assumption is that during the last eight centuries of tilling, many ringfort sites were destroyed. On this basis, Stout states that there are 45,119 ringforts in Ireland of which 41% have been positively identified as of March 1995.  The mean density for Ireland as a whole is 0.55 per square kilometre. The density goes from below 0.20 per square kilometre in Donegal, Kildare and Dublin to above 1.0 per square kilometre in Roscommon, Limerick and Sligo. The regions of highest density are north Munster, east Connaught/ northwest Leinster and east Ulster. Areas of low density are in northwest Ulster and most of Leinster.\n\nAs one can see, Donegal is an area of low ringfort concentration. It is therefore odd to find a hillfort of the size and scope of Aileach in this area.  The ringfort density of Northwest Ulster as a whole is 0.16 per square kilometre.  Northwest Ulster includes all of Donegal and the western portions of Londonderry and Tyrone. Ringforts are virtually absent from the areas of Derryveagh, the [[Blue Stacks]], Slieve League and Inishowen. Ringforts are rarely found in similarly elevated areas of Londonderry and Tyrone, including the [[Sperrin Mountains]] and west of the Roe River. Due to the inhospitable nature of these areas due to blanket bogs and thin rock, they were sparsely populated. There were pockets of settlement such as southwest Donegal. Ringsforts can be found along the eastern slopes of Derryveagh Mountains, the Roe River valley and the [[Mourne River]] basin. Although some Early Christian settlement is present, the areas as a whole was relatively sparsely settled with ringforts despite the Mourne and Foyle river valleys being extremely suitable for agricultural exploitation.  Other forms of secular settlement are also thinly distributed in the area although several [[souterrains]] have been found. Northwest Ulster maintained a low population density throughout the Early Christian Era. Barrett examined ringforts in southern Donegal.  She identified 124 ringforts in an area reaching from Glen Head to Lough Ekse and south along the county boundary to Bundoran. Thirty-two of the ringforts were cashels and 15% were bivallate sites. Ringfort builders avoided land below 30 metres preferring land between 30 and 60 metres.  Soil quality was statistically proven to be a key determinant of settlement density.  Brown earth and grey-brown podzolic soils were particularly favoured explaining the concentration of sites west of Donegal Bay. The brown earth soils and the podzolic soils of St. John's peninsula also attracted a high proportion of sites. The distribution of ecclesiastical sites corresponds broadly with that of ringforts.\n\n==Function==\nTheories accounting for the function of hillforts range from their use as defensive sites to ceremonial enclosures. The Grian\u00e1n of Aileach could possibly have served both of these purposes and served even more functions.\n\nA number of writers in the nineteenth century suggested that one of the two sites marked as Regia (or royal place) on Ptolemy's map of Ireland, may be identified with the Grian\u00e1n.  The site itself is ancient. Some early texts refer to Aileach as metaphorically being the oldest building in Ireland.\n\nPerhaps the best way to discover the function of this hillfort is to break down its name.  The site of the Grian\u00e1n of Aileach has been known by many names over its long history: Aileach; Aileach Neid; Aileach Frigrinn, Aileach Imchell; Grian\u00e1n Ailigh and Aileach of the Kings.  The word Aileach has a long history and is found both in Ireland and Scotland. Both Petrie and Lacy suggest that it comes from an adjective derived from old Irish \"Ail\", which means a rock, stone or boulder. Lacy conduces that Aileach, therefore, means either stony or stone place. Petrie goes further by saying it means stone house or habitation. In the same vein, Lacy suggests the etymology of the word might derive from \"Ali Theach\" meaning stone house. However, Lacy's primary translation seems more plausible due to the name Aileach originally coming from Aileach M\u00f3r which is mentioned in the chronology section. The name may have come from the rocky nature of the area or possibly acts as a description of the stone cashel itself.\n\nThe word Grian\u00e1n means sunny place. It was appropriated by the early Irish to mean a place with a view. This is probably the sense in which the word was used to describe the Grian\u00e1n under discussion. An earlier theory was that the word meant \"temple of the sun\". This theory has not been substantiated. There is much evidence that the word was constantly used in a figurative sense to signify a distinguished residence or palace.  Perhaps, if interpreted in this sense it may mean that if one is in the presence of a king, one will always be in a sunny place. The best summary one can contrive from the etymological breakdown of the name is that it means \"The Stone Palace of the Sunny View\".\n\nIn the historic period, from the middle of the sixth century, the Grian\u00e1n of Aileach is always thought of as the capital of the northern Ui Neill, the dynasty descended from Niall of the Nine Hostages.  It acted as such up until the twelfth century. However, as it was destroyed in 1050, it was the capital in name only. It was the site where the Kings of Aileach held their inauguration ceremonies. It is written in the Tripartite Life of St. Patrick that Patrick blessed the fortress and left a symbolic flagstone there prophesying that many kings and clerics would come from the place.  This flagstone can no longer be found at the fortress. It is believed that a preserved flagstone at Belmont House School in Derry, called St. Columb's Stone, is the inauguration stone. On one side of the stone, which is 2 metres square, are carved two feet marks. However, there is no substantiating evidence to back this up.\n\nWe can see from this evidence that Grian\u00e1n of Aileach was an extremely important site. It was the secular centre of Northwest Donegal while the ecclesiastical settlement at Derry was the religious centre. Together, they acted as the political hub of the region. Aileach's political and strategic importance was such that the annals report that it was attacked at least three times during its existence. In 674, [[F\u00ednsnechta Fledach]], King of Ireland, destroyed the fort. Perhaps, this was the earlier hillfort that stood on the site before the cashel was built. In 937, during the reign of [[Muirchertach mac N\u00e9ill]], Viking raiders demolished the site.  Vikings had settled at Lough Swilly and Lough Foyle during this period. In 1006, [[Brian Boru]], marched through the territory of the Cenel Conail and the Cenel Eogain and probably came to Aileach.  In 1101, another king of Munster, Muirchertach Ua Briain, came to Inishowen where he proceeded to plunder and ravage the region. He destroyed the Grian\u00e1n of Aileach in revenge for the destruction and demolition of [[Killaloe, County Clare|Kincora]] by [[Domnall Ua Lochlainn]] in 1088.\n\nWhile the main function of this particular hillfort was that of a royal capital, ringforts in general in Ireland functioned as a native version of the common European settlement pattern known as einzelh\u00f6fe: dispersed individual farmsteads.   However, hillforts are of communal rather than single-family importance. It is possible that some ringforts functioned throughout their existence only as cattle enclosures, or with no domestic function. It is unlikely that Aileach was used in such a fashion during or after it ceased to function as a royal fort. The entrance is too low and narrow for cattle to move through. This narrowness of the entrance may be for defensive purposes.\n\nThe only building foundation in the fort, besides the walls, was that of the penal church. Bernard mentions no other foundations. He does mention the finding of some fluted columns which may indicate that there was a stone structure within the fort walls. There is no evidence for any house-like structures though. Circular houses, which are directly associated with the main phase of ringfort occupation, tended to be located towards the centre of the enclosure placing them furthest from an outside attack.  If such a house stood in the fort, any trace of it would have been destroyed while the church was being built.\n\n==Assessment of monument==\nRoyal ringforts would have been surrounded by ringforts of a lower status. This makes the Grian\u00e1n of Aileach an interesting example as no writer has yet mentioned the presence of subordinate ringforts. It would appear that either further archaeological excavation is required to find them or perhaps the Grian\u00e1n is unique in that it may stand alone. As a hillfort, with its more defensive nature, its large size and the surrounding barren landscape, it probably did stand alone. Raftery suggests that perhaps some hillforts were used as places of last refuge.   However, this could not have possibly been the case with Aileach. Without reading the histories of the site, the physical presence of the three ramparts confirms that whoever the occupant, their status was quite, if not uniquely, high. The ramparts are meant to be seen rather than used. Based on the written histories we know that this was the seat of the Ui Neill. Based on the archaeological evidence which indicates that there were large quantities of animal meat consumed and that games were played (the chequered board mentioned above), this hillfort seems to be a place of festival and, if the annals are to be believed, a place of inaugurational ceremony. The presence of the tumulus suggests an ancient basis to this settlement, perhaps even religious in some way. The cold winds (especially during winter) and the high altitude would be uncomfortable for continual residence.\n\nIn the section on distribution, we saw that ringforts in Northwest Ulster were extremely rare. If this was the case during the period, the cashel of Aileach would have been quite a sight to behold for the local population and the fact that a ringfort of its magnitude was even built shows the importance of its occupants. Its relative proximity to Derry shows a conscious attempt to remain connected to that ecclesiastical site.\n\nThe Grian\u00e1n of Aileach probably served the same purpose as Tara. It was a place of festival and ritual inauguration. It seems that by linking St. Patrick into the institution of Aileach, converts were attempting to consolidate it as a site of Christian inauguration while acknowledging their pagan past.  The naming of the holy well after Patrick can be seen as a symbol of continuity of settlement rather than usurpation.\n\n==In mythology==\nIn [[Irish mythology]] and folklore, the ringfort is said to have been originally built by [[the Dagda]], a god and the celebrated king of the [[Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann]], who planned and fought the battle of the second or northern [[Magh Tuireadh]], against the [[Fomorians]]. The fort was erected around the grave of his son [[Aedh]] who had been killed through jealousy by Corrgenn, a [[Connacht]] chieftain. The history of the death of Aedh, and the building of Aileach, is given at length in a poem preserved in the [[Book of Lecan]] which has been printed with an English translation (verse 38 Ordnance Memoir of the parish of Templemore, Dr Perie). The verses regarding the building of this rath follow:\n\n<poem>\n\"Then were brought the two good men\nIn art experts,\n\"Garbhan and Imcheall\", to Eochaid [Daghda],\nThe fair-haired, vindictive; \nhe ordered these a rath to build, Aileach.\"\nAround the gentle youth:\nThat it should be a rath of splendid sections\u2014\nThe finest in Erinn.\nNeid, son of Indai, said to them,\n[He] of the severe mind,\nThat the best hosts in the world could not erect\nA building like Aileach.\nGarbhan the active proceeded to dress\nAnd to cut [the stones];\nImcheall proceeded to set them\nAll around in the house.\nThe building of Aileach's fastness came to an end,\nThough it was a laborious process;\nThe top of the house of the groaning hostages\n\"One stone closed\".\n</poem>\n\nIn a subsequent verse of this poem (verse 54), the author says that Aileach is the senior or father of all the buildings in Erinn. It also states that in later times it was called Aileach Frigrind. According to another poem written by Flann of Monasterboice and preserved in the Book of Leinster, Frigrind was a famous builder who claimed the protection of the monarch Fiacha Sraibhthine who was slain in the battle of Dubh Chomar, in Meath, a.d. 322;<ref name=\"manners\">''Manners and Customs of the Ancient Irish'', p 10., O Curry E.</ref> the monarch gave him the ancient fort of Aileach for his dwelling-place. Here Frigrind built a splendid house of wood for his wife from red yew, carved and emblazoned with gold and bronze; thick set it with shining gems.<ref name=\"manners\"/> It appears clearly from this very ancient poem that not only was the outer Rath, or protective circle, of Aileach built of stone by the two masons Imcheall and Garbhan, but the palace and other houses within the enclosure were also built of stone (nay, even of chipped and cut stone). According to the chronology of the Annals of the Four Masters, Aileach was built seventeen hundred years before the Christian era. Also worth noticing is the fact that Aileach is one of the few spots in Ireland that is marked in its proper place by the geographer Ptolemy of Alexandria, who some say lived in the second century, nearly two hundred years before the time of Frigrind. Ptolemy distinguishes the Rath as a royal residence.<ref name=\"manners\"/>\n\n==Site today==\n[[Image:Ringfort entrance way 2.JPG|thumb|right|View of entrance of ''Grianan of Aileach'' 2007]]\nThe town of [[Burt, County Donegal|Burt]] is the nearest community and the fortress stands mainly intact insofar as its main walls and features are concerned. Portions of the fortress were destroyed over time but much was rebuilt in the nineteenth century with a view towards retaining the historic nature and aesthetics of the fortress. Dr. Bernard is recorded as having directed the restoration work. The site is now owned by the Irish government.\n\nMore restoration work has taken place since 2001 by the [[Office of Public Works]] due to a wall collapse and is the subject of public controversy.  If any dimensional change in the building's architecture has occurred, nothing about it has been published yet. There are some visible signs of its restoration. Large sections of the wall have been replaced. These sections are easily visually differentiated from the original wall by their shape and colour. Some of the upper parts of the wall have been cemented, probably to prevent falling stones. An iron gate has been set into the entrance. In 2007, the entrance corridor was supported by iron girders which have since been removed.\n\n==In popular culture==\n\nThe filmmaker Gerard Lough used the fort as a location for his 2015 film ''[[Night People (2015 film)|Night People]]'' by filming a sequence there over the course of a two-day period at [[Blue hour]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstones.org/place.aspx?p=937&i=15|title=Grian\u00e1n of Aileach|website=www.irishstones.org|accessdate=14 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[Armand Gatti]] filmed a scene at the fort in his 1983 film ''Nous \u00e9tions tous des noms d'arbres'' (\"And our names were names of trees\").<ref name=\"Nous \u00e9tions tous des noms d'arbres (1983)\">{{cite web|title=Nous \u00e9tions tous des noms d'arbres (1983)|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0257974/fullcredits/?ref_=tt_ov_st_sm|publisher=IMDb}}</ref>\n\n==Bibliography==\n*Bernard, Walter, 'Exploration and Restoration of the Ruin of the Grianan of Aileach' in ''PRIA'', Ser. 2 Vol. 9 (1879), pp 415\u201323.

''A Military History of Ireland''. p.37</ref> although there is evidence that the site had been in use before the fort was built. It has been identified as the seat of the [[Kings of Ailech|Kingdom of Ailech]] and one of the [[Royal sites of Ireland|royal sites]] of [[Gaelic Ireland]]. The wall is about {{convert|4.5|m|ft}} thick and {{convert|5|m|ft}} high. Inside it has three terraces, which are linked by steps, and two long passages within it. Originally, there would have been buildings inside the ringfort.<!--can we add more info about these buildings?--> Just outside it are the remains of a [[water well|well]] and a [[tumulus]].\n\nBy the 12th century, the Kingdom of Ailech had become embattled and lost a fair amount of territory to the [[Norman invasion of Ireland|invading Normans]]. According to Irish literature, the ringfort was mostly destroyed by [[Muirchertach Ua Briain]], King of Munster, in 1101. Substantial restoration work was carried out in 1870. Today, the site is an [[National monuments of Ireland|Irish National Monument]] and a tourist attraction.\n[[File:Grianan_of_Aileach_scenic_birds_eye_view.png|thumb|Grianan of Aileach fort, [[bird's-eye view]]]]\n[[File:An Grianan fort at sunset 2.jpg|thumb|An Grianan fort at sunset]]\n[[File:A stunning sunset above the fort.jpg|thumb|Sunset over the fort]]\n\n==Description and interpretation==\n[[File:Journal of the Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland (1915) (14779372521).jpg|thumb|Plan of the Grian\u00e1n]]\nThe Grian\u00e1n is located on the western edge of a small group of hills that lie between the upper reaches of [[Lough Swilly]] and [[Lough Foyle]]. Although the hill is comparatively not that high, the summit dominates the neighbouring counties of [[County Londonderry|Londonderry]], [[County Donegal|Donegal]] and [[County Tyrone|Tyrone]]. Located at the edge of the [[Inishowen]] peninsula, it is {{convert|11.25|km|mi|0}} northwest of the ecclesiastical site of [[Derry]]. The histories of the sites are closely linked. There is much legend and historical material related to the Grian\u00e1n of Aileach. The [[Irish annals]] record its destruction in 1101. The main monument on the hill is a stone [[wikt:caiseal|cashel]], restored in the nineteenth century, but probably built in the eighth century CE. The summit's use as an area of settlement may go back much further. A [[tumulus]] at the Grian\u00e1n may date back to the [[Neolithic]] age. A covered well was found near the cashel in the early nineteenth century.\n[[Image:Grainan of aileach.jpg|thumb|right|Interior view of ''Grianan of Aileach'']]\n[[Image:Grianan of Aileach view.Jpg|thumb|right|View from ''Grianan of Aileach'']]\n<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Greenan.JPG|180px|right|thumb|Photographed in 2007 from the air. (www.gordondunn.co.uk)]] -->\n[[George Petrie (artist)|George Petrie]] first surveyed the Grian\u00e1n of Aileach in the 1830s.  At this time the cashel was nothing more than a mere ruin. He gives a description of the hill and the monument. The eastern ascent of the hill is described as gradual but within {{convert|30|m}} of the top, it terminated in a circular apex. An ancient road between two ledges of natural rock led to the summit. The cashel was surrounded by three concentric ramparts. Petrie suggests that, in the fashion of other monuments of this type such as [[Navan Fort|Emania]], the whole hill may have been enclosed by many other ramparts. There is no physical or historical evidence for this. The ramparts that remained were made of earth and stone and follow the natural form of the hill with an irregular circular pattern. They ascend above each other creating levelled terraces. The circular apex of the hill within the outermost enclosure contains about {{convert|2.2|ha|acre}}, within the second about  {{convert|1.6|ha|acre}} and within the third about {{convert|4|ha|acre}}. Currently, the innermost bank is very low, worn and heather-covered but traceable for almost its entire circuit.  The other two banks are in a similar state but are untraceable for long sections. Between the inner most rampart and the cashel, the road dwindles in its width and curves slightly to the right. This \"path\" was strengthened on either side by walls. At the time of the survey only the foundation stones of these walls remained. Petrie's plan of the site shows a line of stones leading up to the entrance. These are now gone.\n\nThe ruins of the cashel itself are described as being a circular wall enclosing an area of {{convert|23.6|m|}}  in diameter. The wall had a height of {{convert|1.8|m}} with a breadth varying from {{convert|4.6|m}} to {{convert|3.5|m}}. While not perpendicular, it had an inclination inwards indicating its similarity to most other Irish stone forts.  Petrie suggests that it was probably originally between twice and four times as high as it was when he surveyed it. {{convert|1.5|m}} up on the interior side of the wall, the thickness was {{convert|0.76|m}} due to the presence of terracing. The terrace is reached by flights of steps on either side of the entrance gateway. Fallen stones had covered any other existing stairs. Petrie suggests that there were originally three or four such terraces ascending to the top of the wall.  On each side of the entranceway, there are \"galleries\" within the wall. Their precise purpose is not clear and they do not connect with the entrance. These two wall-passages, one on the south and another from the northeast run towards the gateway, but stop short. Near the north end of the south passage is a small recess in its west wall. At the south end of the north passage there is a seat-stone.\n\n[[Image:Grianan of Aileach Wall Stones.jpg|thumb|Grianan Ailligh wall stones of [[mica schist]].]]\n[[Image:Grianan1878.jpg|thumb|right|The official re-opening of ''Grianan Aileach'' in 1878 following the reconstruction of Dr. Walter Bernard.]]\nThe current hillfort, after the restoration of 1874\u20131878, is substantially different but much of the old structure remains intact. During the restoration, it was found that parts of the original drystone masonry had been preserved under the collapse.  The workers marked, in tar, the undisturbed portions of the cashel and used the collapsed stone to build on this foundation. They supplemented these with other stones from the area to replace those 'removed by King Murdoch O'Brien in 1101'.  The internal diameters of the cashel are 23.6 metres north to south and {{convert|23.2|m}} east to west. The lintel-covered entrance is {{convert|4.65|m}} long, {{convert|1.12|m}} wide and {{convert|1.86|m}} metres high. Before the restoration, the gateway's lintel was not in place. It was{{convert|1.3|m}} wide and {{convert|1.2|m}} high. It leads into the fort from the east. Slight recesses on either side of the entrance way have been filled in.  They were probably to allow double leaves of an original doorway to fold flush against the wall.  The interior rises in three terraces accessible by stairways which are previously mentioned. The outer wall is a dry-stone construction. On each side of the entranceway, there are \"galleries\" within the wall. Their precise purpose is not clear and they do not connect with the entrance. These two wall-passages, one on the south and another from the northeast run towards the gateway, but stop short. The south wall passage entrance is {{convert|45|cm}} wide, {{convert|69|cm}} high and {{convert|1.4|m}} long. It turns through a right angle where it becomes {{convert|50|cm}} wide,{{convert|85|cm}} high and {{convert|20.4|m}} long. Near the north end there is a recess on the west side {{convert|50|cm}} wide, {{convert|1|m}} and {{convert|75|cm}} deep. The northeast gallery entrance is {{convert|65|cm}} wide, {{convert|97|cm}} high and {{convert|1.55|m}} long. It meets the main part of the passage in a T-junction. To the north, the passage is{{convert|70|cm}} wide, {{convert|1.3|m}} high and {{convert|2.5|m}} long. To the south, the passage is {{convert|60|cm}} wide, {{convert|1.4|m}} high and {{convert|8.6|m}} long.  Near the north of end of the south passage is a small recess in its west wall. At the south end of the north passage there is a seat-stone. The interior of the cashel is fairly level but Petrie recorded the remains of a small oblong church measuring {{convert|5|m}} by {{convert|4.3|m}}. The walls were {{convert|61|cm}} thick and not more than {{convert|62|cm}} high. The structure was constructed of mortar but nothing remains of it today. A drain runs through the cashel wall at ground level on the northwest side. It leads from a midden in the western side of the enclosure that was {{convert|1.7|m}} in diameter and one foot deep.\n[[Image:Well of St Patrick Grianan Ailligh.JPG|thumb|St. Patrick's Well south of the Grian\u00e1n of Aileach.]]\n\nThere are many clues that the Grian\u00e1n of Aileach is a multi-period site.  Brian Lacy suggests that the earthen banks surrounding the fort probably represent the defences of a hillfort of the late Bronze Age or Iron Age. Between the two outer banks on the south side of the hill, is the formerly covered spring well which is dedicated to St. Patrick.  Petrie describes the tumulus, between the second and third wall, as being a small mound surrounded by a circle of ten stones. These stones were laid horizontally and converged towards the centre. In Petrie's time, the mound had been excavated but nothing to explain its meaning was discovered.  It was subsequently destroyed but its former position is marked by a heap of broken stones.\n\nDuring the excavation work of the 1870s, Bernard documented the discovery of many artefacts. Behind a niche in the doorway, a large stone {{convert|40|cm}} wide was found. It had a round hole in the centre, 7.6 centimetres (3&nbsp;in) deep and 3.8 centimetres (1.5&nbsp;in) in diameter. A rotten piece of wood was found in the hole. Bernard was unable to decipher its use suggesting only that it could have been a sundial.\n\nBernard discovered many animal bones including sheep, cattle, goats and birds. He found stone items including \"sling-stones\", \"warrior's clubs\" and a \"sugar-loaf-shaped stone with a well-cut base\" {{convert|25|cm|0}} long, {{convert|38|cm}} round base, {{convert|36|cm}} round centre and {{convert|25|cm|0}} round top.  The most interesting stone object was \"a slab of [[sandstone]], chequered into thirty-six squares\", which Lacy believed to be some kind of gaming board. Among the miscellaneous items found were a plough socket, an iron ring, some coins and a bead.\n\n==Morphology==\nThe Grian\u00e1n of Aileach, at its broadest description, is a ringfort. More precisely it is a [[multivallate]] [[wikt:caiseal|cashel]] [[hillfort]].\n\n[[File:An Grianan fort at sunset.jpg|thumb|An Grianan fort at sunset from above]]\n\nA ring fort can be described as a space, usually circular, surrounded by a bank and ditch or simply a rampart of stone. The bank is generally built by piling up inside the fosse the material obtained digging the latter. Ringforts vary considerably in size and style. In more elaborately defended examples, such as Aileach, the defences take up a much greater area than the enclosure itself.\n\nMatthew Stout gives many examples of why the people who built these structures chose a circular formation.  First of all, they had strategic advantages. Circular sites allowed for a broad perspective of the surrounding area and allowed the maximum area to be enclosed relative to the bank constructed. He also comes up with some much more metaphysical theories. He suggests that a circular formation linked the site and its occupants with the circular burial mounds of their ancestors. About a third of all Irish hillforts have mounds or cairns within them.  The Aileach is no exception. He also puts forward the idea that a circular form was favoured because corners could act as a dwelling-place of evil spirits. He bases these claims on [[ethnographic]] comparisons.{{Vague|date=November 2018}} {{Citation needed|reason=Where does he claim this? |date=November 2018}}\n\nRingforts housed families of varying degrees of wealth, so that some of them are more impressive than others. Ringforts do not normally occupy dominant or commanding positions. The only exception to this are the ringforts built in areas of bad drainage where high places are the only suitable spots for habitation.  Raftery names three monuments which he finds hard to categorise as being either a ringfort or a hillfort: Cahirciveen; Carraig Aille; and Lough Gur.  While the places where they sit are areas of natural defence, they may have been built there for drainage purposes. The buildings themselves are not militaristic or defensive in themselves. They were probably family homesteads. The defining characteristic of hillforts is an inbuilt defensive nature.\n\nTherefore, hillforts as a subcategory of the ringfort are defined by their location and style of construction. Hillfort consist of \u2018large hilltop areas on which the summit is enclosed by one (univallate) or multiple ramparts (multivallate) of earth or stone\u2019.  A good example would be [[D\u00fan Aengus]] on [[Inishmore]]. Its defensive nature is explicit due to the system of stone slabs, known as [[chevaux de frise]], planted into the ground outside the fort structure itself.\n\nThe Grian\u00e1n of Aileach, as described in the introductory section, is encircled by three enclosures and is therefore trivallate. The actual living space of ringforts often forms less than 60% of the total monument area.  Contemporary law tracts described a king's principle dwelling to have been a [[univallate]] ringfort.  Increasing a site's defences without a corresponding increase in its functional area demonstrates either a greater need for defence or a display of status. Therefore, a ring fort with two ramparts (bivallate) acts a status symbol. The rarity of trivallate hillforts, such as that at the Grian\u00e1n, shows the importance and status of its occupants rather a need for defence.\n\nStout gives several examples to indicate their symbolic importance simply due to their impracticality as defensive structures.  In general, they were little more than fences to prevent stock from straying and to protect against wild animals.  As siege tools, they were useless. If anything they were built to repel cattle raids.This might not be the case with the Grian\u00e1n of Aileach\n\nWhile the original structure for which the ramparts were built does not exist any more, the cashel of Aileach, while formidable, was probably designed with less of a defensive function in mind but rather it was built as a symbol of royal power. Stone structures appear both eternal and immovable. The cashel was built on this site for the panoramic view rather than for defence. This could be seen as changing the visual emphasis of the ramparts from being defensive terraces to enclosures of royal power and influence.\n\nHillforts are known throughout western Europe but Irish hillforts were not as well developed and never attained the standard of the so-called Celtic [[Oppida]] of [[Continental Europe]] and Britain.  They vary in size but are of a communal rather than single-family residence. Cashels (stone built ringforts) tend to be much smaller than earthen examples. The average earthen ringfort has an internal diameter of 22 metres in south Donegal; cashels in the same area have an average internal diameter of 20 metres.  The Grian\u00e1n of Aileach, with an average internal diameter of 23.4 metres is larger than the latter and therefore this must be an indication of the wealth and importance of its inhabitants and perhaps it is also an indication of the size of its occupant population. Lacy suggests that the innovative nature of the stone fort of Aileach must have been an unusual site when it was first constructed.  The names Garvan, Frigru/ Rigriu are found in many Irish authorities to be the names of the builders of Aileach.  These characters are linked to the [[Formorians]] and therefore may be nothing more than mythological creations. Lacy believes that the builder may have been [[\u00c1ed Oirdnide]], the victor at the battle of Clo\u00edteach.\n\n==Chronology==\n[[File:Grianan_of_Aileach_scenic_view_01.png|thumb|Grianan of Aileach fort sits on a hilltop in the Inishowen peninsula]]\n\nIt is widely accepted that most ringforts date from the [[Early Christian]] period.  Finds from [[ringforts]] typically include items which date from the second half of the first millennium: a hand-made, bucket shaped pottery style called 'Souterrain Ware', which uses local clays and can be decorated or undecorated; glass beads; bone, bronze and iron pins; and artefacts of bone and metalwork.  The artefacts, which Dr. Bernard found during his excavation of the cashel interior, seem to correspond to the above list of typical items. Indeed, in a recent publication, Brian Lacy comes up with an exact date for its construction which corresponds with this period.  He argues that Aileach is the name of a specific site in antiquity and also the name of the Cen\u00e9l nE\u00f3gain 'homeland' kingdom of Inis Eogian, derived from the place now known as Elaghmore (Aileach M\u00f3r) in County Londonderry.  After the decisive battle of Clo\u00edtech in 789, when the Cen\u00e9l nE\u00f3gain won total control of the over-kingdom of the northern U\u00ed N\u00e9ill, the successful kings relocated to the Grian\u00e1n, building it inside the pre-existing prehistoric hillfort as a visual symbol of their new mastery of all the landscape visible from that commanding view. Stout comes to the conclusion that the majority of Ireland's ringforts were occupied and constructed during a three hundred-year period from the beginning of the seventh century to the end of the ninth century AD.\n\nLacy concludes that Aileach was inhabited by the northern Ui N\u00e9ill dynasty from 789 to about 1050.  This was a period when many of the local kings in Ireland were moving to the towns founded by the Vikings or into more important ecclesiastical sites which by this time seemed to have been functioning as towns following the Vikings' model.\n\n==Distribution==\nBased on the morphology of hillforts, Raftery estimates that there are forty hillforts in Ireland.  However, Lacy suggests that there are fifty forts remaining in Ireland.  Multivallate hillforts are suggested to be confined to the West and South of the country; [[univallate]] forts are to be found in the north and east. The Grian\u00e1n of Aileach is seen as an exception to this pattern.  Raftery suggests that this simple division of distribution might be more blurred after further hillfort study and discovery.<!--Need to update with information from the Hillforts Atlas Project-->\n\nThe distribution of ringforts in general is much wider although we are a long way from knowing the exact number which still survive. Ringfort distribution is not even. Areas of low ringfort density correspond to intensely tilled, highly-[[Normans|Normanised]] areas.  The assumption is that during the last eight centuries of tilling, many ringfort sites were destroyed. On this basis, Stout states that there are 45,119 ringforts in Ireland of which 41% have been positively identified as of March 1995.  The mean density for Ireland as a whole is 0.55 per square kilometre. The density goes from below 0.20 per square kilometre in Donegal, Kildare and Dublin to above 1.0 per square kilometre in Roscommon, Limerick and Sligo. The regions of highest density are north Munster, east Connaught/ northwest Leinster and east Ulster. Areas of low density are in northwest Ulster and most of Leinster.\n\nAs one can see, Donegal is an area of low ringfort concentration. It is therefore odd to find a hillfort of the size and scope of Aileach in this area.  The ringfort density of Northwest Ulster as a whole is 0.16 per square kilometre.  Northwest Ulster includes all of Donegal and the western portions of Londonderry and Tyrone. Ringforts are virtually absent from the areas of Derryveagh, the [[Blue Stacks]], Slieve League and Inishowen. Ringforts are rarely found in similarly elevated areas of Londonderry and Tyrone, including the [[Sperrin Mountains]] and west of the Roe River. Due to the inhospitable nature of these areas due to blanket bogs and thin rock, they were sparsely populated. There were pockets of settlement such as southwest Donegal. Ringsforts can be found along the eastern slopes of Derryveagh Mountains, the Roe River valley and the [[Mourne River]] basin. Although some Early Christian settlement is present, the areas as a whole was relatively sparsely settled with ringforts despite the Mourne and Foyle river valleys being extremely suitable for agricultural exploitation.  Other forms of secular settlement are also thinly distributed in the area although several [[souterrains]] have been found. Northwest Ulster maintained a low population density throughout the Early Christian Era. Barrett examined ringforts in southern Donegal.  She identified 124 ringforts in an area reaching from Glen Head to Lough Ekse and south along the county boundary to Bundoran. Thirty-two of the ringforts were cashels and 15% were bivallate sites. Ringfort builders avoided land below 30 metres preferring land between 30 and 60 metres.  Soil quality was statistically proven to be a key determinant of settlement density.  Brown earth and grey-brown podzolic soils were particularly favoured explaining the concentration of sites west of Donegal Bay. The brown earth soils and the podzolic soils of St. John's peninsula also attracted a high proportion of sites. The distribution of ecclesiastical sites corresponds broadly with that of ringforts.\n\n==Function==\nTheories accounting for the function of hillforts range from their use as defensive sites to ceremonial enclosures. The Grian\u00e1n of Aileach could possibly have served both of these purposes and served even more functions.\n\nA number of writers in the nineteenth century suggested that one of the two sites marked as Regia (or royal place) on Ptolemy's map of Ireland, may be identified with the Grian\u00e1n.  The site itself is ancient. Some early texts refer to Aileach as metaphorically being the oldest building in Ireland.\n\nPerhaps the best way to discover the function of this hillfort is to break down its name.  The site of the Grian\u00e1n of Aileach has been known by many names over its long history: Aileach; Aileach Neid; Aileach Frigrinn, Aileach Imchell; Grian\u00e1n Ailigh and Aileach of the Kings.  The word Aileach has a long history and is found both in Ireland and Scotland. Both Petrie and Lacy suggest that it comes from an adjective derived from old Irish \"Ail\", which means a rock, stone or boulder. Lacy conduces that Aileach therefore means either stony or stone place. Petrie goes further by saying it means stone house or habitation. In the same vein, Lacy suggests the etymology of the word might derive from \"Ali Theach\" meaning stone house. However, Lacy's primary translation seems more plausible due to the name Aileach originally coming from Aileach M\u00f3r which is mentioned in the chronology section. The name may have come from the rocky nature of the area or possibly acts as a description of the stone cashel itself.\n\nThe word Grian\u00e1n means sunny place. It was appropriated by the early Irish to mean a place with a view. This is probably the sense in which the word was used to describe the Grian\u00e1n under discussion. An earlier theory was that the word meant \"temple of the sun\". This theory has not been substantiated. There is much evidence that the word was constantly used in a figurative sense to signify a distinguished residence or palace.  Perhaps, if interpreted in this sense it may mean that if one is in the presence of a king, one will always be in a sunny place. The best summary one can contrive from the etymological breakdown of the name is that it means \"The Stone Palace of the Sunny View\".\n\nIn the historic period, from the middle of the sixth century, the Grian\u00e1n of Aileach is always thought of as the capital of the northern Ui Neill, the dynasty descended from Niall of the Nine Hostages.  It acted as such up until the twelfth century. However, as it was destroyed in 1050, it was the capital in name only. It was the site where the Kings of Aileach held their inauguration ceremonies. It is written in the Tripartite Life of St. Patrick that Patrick blessed the fortress and left a symbolic flagstone there prophesying that many kings and clerics would come from the place.  This flagstone can no longer be found at the fortress. It is believed that a preserved flagstone at Belmont House School in Derry, called St. Columb's Stone, is the inauguration stone. On one side of the stone, which is 2 metres square, are carved two feet marks. However, there is no substantiating evidence to back this up.\n\nWe can see from this evidence that Grian\u00e1n of Aileach was an extremely important site. It was the secular centre of Northwest Donegal while the ecclesiastical settlement at Derry was the religious centre. Together, they acted as the political hub of the region. Aileach's political and strategic importance was such that the annals report that it was attacked at least three times during its existence. In 674, [[F\u00ednsnechta Fledach]], King of Ireland, destroyed the fort. Perhaps, this was the earlier hillfort that stood on the site before the cashel was built. In 937, during the reign of [[Muirchertach mac N\u00e9ill]], Viking raiders demolished the site.  Vikings had settled at Lough Swilly and Lough Foyle during this period. In 1006, [[Brian Boru]], marched though the territory of the Cenel Conail and the Cenel Eogain and probably came to Aileach.  In 1101, another king of Munster, Muirchertach Ua Briain, came to Inishowen where he proceeded to plunder and ravage the region. He destroyed the Grian\u00e1n of Aileach in revenge for the destruction and demolition of [[Killaloe, County Clare|Kincora]] by [[Domnall Ua Lochlainn]] in 1088.\n\nWhile the main function of this particular hillfort was that of a royal capital, ringforts in general in Ireland functioned as a native version of the common European settlement pattern known as einzelh\u00f6fe: dispersed individual farmsteads.   However, hillforts are of communal rather than single-family importance. It is possible that some ringforts functioned throughout their existence only as cattle enclosures, or with no domestic function. It is unlikely that Aileach was used in such a fashion during or after it ceased to function as a royal fort. The entrance is too low and narrow for cattle to move through. This narrowness of the entrance may be for defensive purposes.\n\nThe only building foundation in the fort, besides the walls, was that of the penal church. Bernard mentions no other foundations. He does mention the finding of some fluted columns which may indicate that there was a stone structure within the fort walls. There is no evidence for any house-like structures though. Circular houses, which are directly associated with the main phase of ringfort occupation, tended to be located towards the centre of the enclosure placing them furthest from an outside attack.  If such a house stood in the fort, any trace of it would have been destroyed while the church was being built.\n\n==Assessment of monument==\nRoyal ringforts would have been surrounded by ringforts of a lower status. This makes the Grian\u00e1n of Aileach an interesting example as no writer has yet mentioned the presence of subordinate ringforts. It would appear that either further archaeological excavation is required to find them or perhaps the Grian\u00e1n is unique in that it may stand alone. As a hillfort, with its more defensive nature, its large size and the surrounding barren landscape, it probably did stand alone. Raftery suggests that perhaps some hillforts were used as places of last refuge.   However, this could not have possibly been the case with Aileach. Without reading the histories of the site, the physical presence of the three ramparts confirms that whoever the occupant, their status was quite, if not uniquely, high. The ramparts are meant to be seen rather than used. Based on the written histories we know that this was the seat of the Ui Neill. Based on the archaeological evidence which indicates that there were large quantities of animal meat consumed and that games were played (the chequered board mentioned above), this hillfort seems to be a place of festival and, if the annals are to be believed, a place of inaugurational ceremony. The presence of the tumulus suggests an ancient basis to this settlement, perhaps even religious in someway. The cold winds (especially during winter) and the high altitude would be uncomfortable for continual residence.\n\nIn the section on distribution, we saw that ringforts in Northwest Ulster were extremely rare. If this was the case during the period, the cashel of Aileach would have been quite a sight to behold for the local population and the fact that a ringfort of its magnitude was even built shows the importance of its occupants. Its relative proximity to Derry shows a conscious attempt to remain connected to that ecclesiastical site.\n\nThe Grian\u00e1n of Aileach probably served the same purpose as Tara. It was a place of festival and ritual inauguration. It seems that by linking St. Patrick into the institution of Aileach, converts were attempting to consolidate it as a site of Christian inauguration while acknowledging their pagan past.  The naming of the holy well after Patrick can be seen as a symbol of continuity of settlement rather than usurpation.\n\n==In mythology==\nIn [[Irish mythology]] and folklore, the ringfort is said to have been originally built by [[the Dagda]], a god and the celebrated king of the [[Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann]], who planned and fought the battle of the second or northern [[Magh Tuireadh]], against the [[Fomorians]]. The fort was erected around the grave of his son [[Aedh]] who had been killed through jealousy by Corrgenn, a [[Connacht]] chieftain. The history of the death of Aedh, and the building of Aileach, is given at length in a poem preserved in the [[Book of Lecan]] which has been printed with an English translation (verse 38 Ordnance Memoir of the parish of Templemore, Dr Perie). The verses regarding the building of this rath follow:\n\n<poem>\n\"Then were brought the two good men\nIn art experts,\n\"Garbhan and Imcheall\", to Eochaid [Daghda],\nThe fair-haired, vindictive; \nhe ordered these a rath to build, Aileach.\"\nAround the gentle youth:\nThat it should be a rath of splendid sections\u2014\nThe finest in Erinn.\nNeid, son of Indai, said to them,\n[He] of the severe mind,\nThat the best hosts in the world could not erect\nA building like Aileach.\nGarbhan the active proceeded to dress\nAnd to cut [the stones];\nImcheall proceeded to set them\nAll around in the house.\nThe building of Aileach's fastness came to an end,\nThough it was a laborious process;\nThe top of the house of the groaning hostages\n\"One stone closed\".\n</poem>\n\nIn a subsequent verse of this poem (verse 54), the author says that Aileach is the senior or father of all the buildings in Erinn. It also states that in later times it was called Aileach Frigrind. According to another poem written by Flann of Monasterboice and preserved in the Book of Leinster, Frigrind was a famous builder who claimed the protection of the monarch Fiacha Sraibhthine who was slain in the battle of Dubh Chomar, in Meath, a.d. 322;<ref name=\"manners\">''Manners and Customs of the Ancient Irish'', p 10., O Curry E.</ref> the monarch gave him the ancient fort of Aileach for his dwelling-place. Here Frigrind built a splendid house of wood for his wife from red yew, carved and emblazoned with gold and bronze; thick set it with shining gems.<ref name=\"manners\"/> It appears clearly from this very ancient poem that not only was the outer Rath, or protective circle, of Aileach built of stone by the two masons Imcheall and Garbhan, but the palace and other houses within the enclosure were also built of stone (nay, even of chipped and cut stone). According to the chronology of the Annals of the Four Masters, Aileach was built seventeen hundred years before the Christian era. Also worth noticing is the fact that Aileach is one of the few spots in Ireland that is marked in its proper place by the geographer Ptolemy of Alexandria, who some say lived in the second century, nearly two hundred years before the time of Frigrind. Ptolemy distinguishes the Rath as a royal residence.<ref name=\"manners\"/>\n\n==Site today==\n[[Image:Ringfort entrance way 2.JPG|thumb|right|View of entrance of ''Grianan of Aileach'' 2007]]\nThe town of [[Burt, County Donegal|Burt]] is the nearest community and the fortress stands mainly intact insofar as its main walls and features are concerned. Portions of the fortress were destroyed over time but much was rebuilt in the nineteenth century with a view towards retaining the historic nature and aesthetics of the fortress. Dr. Bernard is recorded as having directed the restoration work. The site is now owned by the Irish government.\n\nMore restoration work has taken place since 2001 by the [[Office of Public Works]] due to a wall collapse and is the subject of public controversy.  If any dimensional change in the building's architecture has occurred, nothing about it has been published yet. There are some visible signs of its restoration. Large sections of the wall have been replaced. These sections are easily visually differentiated from the original wall by their shape and colour. Some of the upper parts of the wall have been cemented, probably to prevent falling stones. An iron gate has been set into the entrance.
