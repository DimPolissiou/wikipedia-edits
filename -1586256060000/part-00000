Angelica never failed to enchant the famous, intelligent men she met, and in Paris she soon befriended [[Benjamin Franklin]], who was then America's Minister to France.<ref name=Chernow-p204/> She also developed lasting friendships with Franklin's successor, [[Thomas Jefferson]], and with the [[Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette|Marquis de Lafayette]].\n\nAfter a brief visit to New York in 1785, the family sailed for England, taking up residence in London. Now the wife of a very wealthy man, Angelica entered a fashionable social circle that included the Prince of Wales (later [[George IV of the United Kingdom|King George IV]]), Whig party leader [[Charles James Fox]], and playwright [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan]].

Philip named the village [[Angelica (village), New York|Angelica]], after his mother.<ref name=Minard/> By 1803, the village was populated with log cabin homes, including Philip's, and he had erected a sawmill and a gristmill.<ref name=Minard/>{{rp|406}}\n\nPhilip Church married Anna Matilda Stewart in Philadelphia on February 4, 1805.<ref name=LinnEgle1968/> Soon after the wedding, the two settled permanently in the [[Angelica (village), New York|village of Angelica]], where a small whitewashed house (locally known as the \"White House\") had already been built for the couple on the banks of the Genesee River.<ref name=pioneer/>\n\nIn 1806, Angelica and John Barker Church began construction on a thirty-room mansion nearby, called [[Belvidere (Belmont, New York)|Belvidere]], which still stands as a privately owned home on the banks of the Genesee in [[Belmont, New York]], near the town of [[Angelica, New York|Angelica]].<ref name=pioneer/> Although they had intended to make it their summer home, it instead became the residence of Philip and Anna Church when it was partially completed in 1810.<ref name=pioneer/>\n\n==Correspondence and personal life==\n[[File:Detail of miniature portrait by Samuel Shelley, possibly depicting Angelica Church.png|thumb|upright|Detail of miniature portrait by [[Samuel Shelley]], thought to depict Angelica Church]]\nMany examples of Angelica Church's personal correspondence with eminent figures such as [[Thomas Jefferson]], [[Alexander Hamilton]], [[George Washington]], and the [[Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette|Marquis de Lafayette]] are preserved in the Library of Congress and other archives.<ref name=UVa/> In 1996, the [[University of Virginia]] purchased a series of 77 letters, including 13 from Jefferson, that had previously been kept in her family's possession.<ref name=JeffersonLetters/>\n\n===Thomas Jefferson===\nIn a letter to Angelica, Jefferson ardently wrote, \"Think of it, my friend, and let us begin a negotiation on the subject.

Correspondence between the two, now preserved in the [[Library of Congress]], demonstrates the strong friendship and affection between them. Hamilton biographer [[Ron Chernow]] wrote that \"the attraction between Hamilton and Angelica was so potent and obvious that many people assumed they were lovers. At the very least, theirs was a friendship of unusual ardor.\"<ref name=Chernow-p186/>\n\nA letter sent by Angelica to her sister Elizabeth, Hamilton's wife, can be read as evidence of sexual attraction, or merely as joking banter between the sisters. Referring to Alexander Hamilton, Angelica wrote, \"If you were as generous as the old Romans, you would lend him to me for a little while.\"<ref name=PBS/> Angelica's extended absence from America, as well as the sisters' mutual affection and the devotion to Hamilton that the whole Schuyler family demonstrated throughout his life, supports a view that no affair actually took place.<ref name=chernow/> alaverga\n\n==Children==\n{{Anchor|Philip Schuyler Church}}\n<!-- This Anchor tag serves to provide a permanent target for incoming section links.

During this period, Angelica made a visit home in 1789 to attend the inauguration of [[George Washington]] as the first president of the United States.\n\n==Return to America and founding of Angelica, N.Y.==\n[[File:Drawing of Philip Church from the New York Times.png|thumb|upright|[[Philip Schuyler Church]], eldest son of Angelica and John Barker Church]]\nJohn and Angelica Church returned to the United States in May 1797 for a visit, and returned permanently in 1799 to be reunited with the Schuyler family in New York.\n\nIn May 1796, John Barker Church accepted a mortgage on {{convert|100000|acre|ha}} of land in present-day [[Allegany County, New York|Allegany County]] and [[Genesee County, New York]], against a debt owed to him by his friend [[Robert Morris (financier)|Robert Morris]].<ref name=NYT-PhilipChurch/><ref name=Clune/> After Morris failed to pay the mortgage, the Churches' eldest son [[Philip Schuyler Church]] acquired the land in a foreclosure sale in May 1800.<ref name=NYT-PhilipChurch/> To take possession of the land, Philip traveled in 1801 to the area, near the Pennsylvania border, with his surveyor [[Moses Van Campen]] and four others.<ref name=Minard/> Philip Church selected specific acreage for a planned village along the [[Genesee River]], with plots and design to be reminiscent of [[Paris]].<ref name=Minard/> The plan included a circular road enclosing a village park at the center of town, streets radiating from the circular road to form a star, and five churches situated around the circle.

Referring to Alexander Hamilton, Angelica wrote, \"If you were as generous as the old Romans, you would lend him to me for a little while.\"<ref name=PBS/> Angelica's extended absence from America, as well as the sisters' mutual affection and the devotion to Hamilton that the whole Schuyler family demonstrated throughout his life, supports a view that no affair actually took place.<ref name=chernow/>\n\n==Children==\n{{Anchor|Philip Schuyler Church}}\n<!-- This Anchor tag serves to provide a permanent target for incoming section links.

For most of them, the first synthesis step is [[decarboxylation]] of tryptophan to form [[tryptamine]]. [[Dimethyltryptamine]] (DMT) is formed from tryptamine by [[methylation]] with the participation of [[coenzyme]] of [[S-adenosyl methionine]] (SAM). [[Psilocin]] is produced by spontaneous dephosphorylation of [[psilocybin]]<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Fricke|first=Janis|last2=Blei|first2=Felix|last3=Hoffmeister|first3=Dirk|date=2017-09-25|title=Enzymatic Synthesis of Psilocybin|journal=Angewandte Chemie International Edition|language=en|volume=56|issue=40|pages=12352\u201312355|doi=10.1002/anie.201705489|pmid=28763571}}</ref>.\n\nIn the biosynthesis of serotonin, the intermediate product is not tryptamine but 5-hydroxytryptophan, which is in turn decarboxylated to form 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin).<ref name=\"ref14\" />\n\n[[File:Serotonin biosynthesis.png|500px|center]]\n\nBiosynthesis of [[beta carboline|\u03b2-carboline]] alkaloids occurs through the formation of [[Schiff base]] from tryptamine and [[aldehyde]] (or [[keto acid]]) and subsequent intramolecular [[Mannich reaction]], where the C(2) carbon atom of indole serves as a [[Nucleophilic addition reactions|nucleophile]]. Then, the [[aromatic compound|aromaticity]] is restored via the loss of a proton at the C(2) atom. The resulting tetrahydro-\u03b2-carboline skeleton then gradually oxidizes to dihydro-\u03b2-carboline and \u03b2-carboline. In the formation of simple \u03b2-carboline alkaloids, such as harmine and harmaline, [[pyruvic acid]] acts as the keto acid. In the synthesis of monoterpenoid indole alkaloids, [[secologanin]] plays the role of the aldehyde. Pirroloindole alkaloids are synthesized in living organisms in a similar way.<ref>Dewick, pp. 349, 365</ref>\n\n[[File:Beta-carboline moiety biosynthesis.png|500px|center]]\n\nBiosynthesis of ergot alkaloids begins with the alkylation of tryptophan by [[dimethylallyl pyrophosphate]] (DMAPP), where the carbon atom C(4) in the indole nucleus plays the role of the nucleophile. The resulting 4-dimethylallyl-L-tryptophan undergoes N-methylation. Further products of biosynthesis are chanoclavine-I and agroclavine \u2013 the latter is hydroxylated to elymoclavine, which in turn oxidizes into [[paspalic acid]]. In the process of allyl rearrangement, paspalic acid is converted to lysergic acid.<ref>Dewick, pp. 369\u2013370</ref>\n\n[[File:Lysergic acid biosynthesis.png|820px|center]]\n\nBiosynthesis of monoterpenoid indole alkaloids begins with the Mannich reaction of tryptamine and secologanin; it yields [[strictosidine]] which is converted to 4,21-dehydrogeissoschizine. Then, the biosynthesis of most alkaloids containing the unperturbed monoterpenoid part (''Corynanthe'' type) proceeds through cyclization with the formation of cathenamine and subsequent reduction to ajmalicine in the presence of [[nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate]] (NADPH). In the biosynthesis of other alkaloids, [[4,21-dehydrogeissoschizine]] first converts into [[preakuammicine]] (an alkaloid of subtype strychnos, type ''Corynanthe'') which gives rise to other alkaloids of subtype strychnos and of the types ''Iboga'' and ''Aspidosperma''. Bisindole alkaloids vinblastine and [[vincristine]] are produced in the reaction involving catarantine (alkaloid of type ''Iboga'') and vindolin (type ''Aspidosperma'').<ref name=\"ref29\" /><ref>{{cite book|author = Tadhg P.

For most of them, the first synthesis step is [[decarboxylation]] of tryptophan to form [[tryptamine]]. [[Dimethyltryptamine]] (DMT) is formed from tryptamine by [[methylation]] with the participation of [[coenzyme]] of [[S-adenosyl methionine]] (SAM). [[Psilocin]] is produced by spontaneous dephosphorylation of [[psilocybin]]<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Fricke|first=Janis|last2=Blei|first2=Felix|last3=Hoffmeister|first3=Dirk|date=2017-09-25|title=Enzymatic Synthesis of Psilocybin|journal=Angewandte Chemie International Edition|language=en|volume=56|issue=40|pages=12352\u201312355|doi=10.1002/anie.201705489|pmid=28763571}}</ref>.\n\nIn the biosynthesis of serotonin, the intermediate product is not tryptamine but 5-hydroxytryptophan, which is in turn decarboxylated to form 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin).<ref name=\"ref14\" />\n\n[[File:Serotonin biosynthesis.png|500px|center]]\n\nBiosynthesis of [[beta carboline|\u03b2-carboline]] alkaloids occurs through the formation of [[Schiff base]] from tryptamine and [[aldehyde]] (or [[keto acid]]) and subsequent intramolecular [[Mannich reaction]], where the C(2) carbon atom of indole serves as a [[Nucleophilic addition reactions|nucleophile]]. Then, the [[aromatic compound|aromaticity]] is restored via the loss of a proton at the C(2) atom. The resulting tetrahydro-\u03b2-carboline skeleton then gradually oxidizes to dihydro-\u03b2-carboline and \u03b2-carboline. In the formation of simple \u03b2-carboline alkaloids, such as harmine and harmaline, [[pyruvic acid]] acts as the keto acid. In the synthesis of monoterpenoid indole alkaloids, [[secologanin]] plays the role of the aldehyde. Pirroloindole alkaloids are synthesized in living organisms in a similar way.<ref>Dewick, pp. 349, 365</ref>\n\n[[File:Beta-carboline moiety biosynthesis.png|500px|center]]\n\nBiosynthesis of ergot alkaloids begins with the alkylation of tryptophan by [[dimethylallyl pyrophosphate]] (DMAPP), where the carbon atom C(4) in the indole nucleus plays the role of the nucleophile. The resulting 4-dimethylallyl-L-tryptophan undergoes N-methylation. Further products of biosynthesis are chanoclavine-I and agroclavine \u2013 the latter is hydroxylated to elymoclavine, which in turn oxidizes into [[paspalic acid]]. In the process of allyl rearrangement, paspalic acid is converted to lysergic acid.<ref>Dewick, pp. 369\u2013370</ref>\n\n[[File:Lysergic acid biosynthesis.png|820px|center]]\n\nBiosynthesis of monoterpenoid indole alkaloids begins with the Mannich reaction of tryptamine and secologanin; it yields [[strictosidine]] which is converted to 4,21-dehydrogeissoschizine. Then, the biosynthesis of most alkaloids containing the unperturbed monoterpenoid part (''Corynanthe'' type) proceeds through cyclization with the formation of cathenamine and subsequent reduction to ajmalicine in the presence of [[nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate]] (NADPH). In the biosynthesis of other alkaloids, [[4,21-dehydrogeissoschizine]] first converts into [[preakuammicine]] (an alkaloid of subtype strychnos, type ''Corynanthe'') which gives rise to other alkaloids of subtype strychnos and of the types ''Iboga'' and ''Aspidosperma''.

Cross accepted the position and moved to Sydney in 1919.<ref name=\"La Trobe\"/> On 31 July 1920, Cross' first [[comic strip]], ''The Man Who Waited'', was published in ''Smith's Weekly''. That was followed in the next week by the first episode of ''[[The Potts|You & Me]]''. Originally a satire, featuring the characters \"Mr Pott\" and \"Whalesteeth\", designed as a means of offering political comment, it was quickly converted into a domestic humour strip. Cross continued to draw the weekly strip for nineteen years until he left Smith's in late December 1939. The strip was taken over by [[Jim Russell (cartoonist)|Jim Russell]] in 1940 and renamed to ''Mr & Mrs Potts''.<ref name=\"Ryan\"/>\n\nOn 17 November 1924, Cross married a 25-year-old clerk Jessie May Hamilton (d. 1972) at the Waverley Methodist Church in [[Bondi Junction, New South Wales|Bondi Junction]].<ref name=\"ADB\"/>\n\nIn 1928, Cross began another strip in ''Smith's Weekly'', ''Smith's Vaudevillans'', introducing the mis-matched characters of \"Rhubarb\", an alcoholic sailor, and \"Norman\", a [[fop]] who played the [[straight man]] to his drunken partner.<ref name=\"Ryan\"/> Another Stan Cross success was the first \"[[Dad and Dave]]\" cartoons, also for ''Smith's Weekly''.<ref>Blaikie, George ''Remember Smith's Weekly'' Angus & Robertson, London 1967</ref> The strip was a straight adaptation of the [[radio serial]], which commenced in 1936, and ran for 2,276 episodes before finishing in 1951.\n\nDuring his time at ''Smith's Weekly'', Cross established a reputation as a skilled draftsman, particularly in the area of single-panel cartoons.<ref name=\"Ryan\"/> In the 29 July 1933 issue of ''Smith's Weekly'', a Cross cartoon featured two men who had been working on top of a building construction. There has been a mishap, and now one is hanging by his fingers from a girder at a frightening height over a street. His mate, to save himself, has grabbed the trousers of the other, yanking them down over his ankles and, looking directly upwards, is convulsed with laughter, while the other implores: \"For gorsake, stop laughing: this is serious!\".<ref name=\"La Trobe\"/> Editor [[Frank Marien]] immediately dubbed it \"The Funniest Drawing in the World\". Such was the popularity of the cartoon that it was reprinted on a quality paper and distributed throughout Australia, with many also being sent overseas. All through the Depression years, and after, the prints, costing two shillings and sixpence, were framed and hung on walls in work-places, hotel bars, barbers' shops, and even in some shop windows.<ref name=\"La Trobe\"/>\n\nCross became ''Smith's Weekly'''s highest-paid artist and second art editor. Short-run series he devised included: ''Things That Make Stan Cross'' (political and economic criticism), ''Places We Have Never Visited'' (law courts, Parliament, the players' room at a test cricket match, etc.), ''Museum of the Future'' and ''Firsts in Australian History'' (the first barmaid, the first strike, the first football match).<ref name=\"DAAO\"/>\n\nTowards the end of 1939, ''Smith's Weekly'' was in the financial trouble and Cross was induced by [[Keith Murdoch]] to join the Melbourne ''[[The Herald (Melbourne)|Herald]]''. Capitalising on his reputation as a comic strip artist, Cross was asked to create a newly daily strip, and he started his most popular strip, ''[[Wally and the Major|The Winks]]'' on 20 April 1940.<ref name=\"Ryan\"/> For the first three months, the strip employed a domestic comedy theme and was basically a toned down version of ''You & Me''. The characters \"Mr Wink\" reflected the role of Mr Potts, while the tall, thin, long-faced character was similar to \"Whalesteeth\". In the initial stages, the characters were given their own weekly strip, ''Tidley Winks & Wally''.<ref name=\"Ryan\"/>  ''The Winks'' was only moderately popular until Cross decided to change the strip's direction and take the main characters into the Army. Mr Winks became Major Winks on 15 July 1940 and the strip was renamed ''Wally and the Major''.<ref name=\"Ryan\"/> Over the next thirty years in newspapers throughout Australia, New Zealand and Fiji, and in eighteen annual comic books (c.1943\u201360), readers were able to enjoy the extraordinary, knock-about adventures and lifestyle of Private Wally Higgins, Major Winks, Pudden Bensen, and a company of comedy players\u2014in the army in [[World War II]] and, afterwards, on their [[North Queensland]] [[sugarcane]] [[plantation]].<ref name=\"ADB\"/> He continued to produce the strip until failing eyesight forced him to get help with the drawings early in 1970.

Consequently, the majority of the anaerobic lifeforms on Earth died when the atmospheric free-oxygen levels soared in an extinction event called the [[Great Oxidation Event]]. The only lifeforms that survived were either those resistant to the oxidizing and poisonous effects of oxygen, or those sequestered in oxygen-free environments.
