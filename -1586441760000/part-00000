Unlike on the Nintendo 3DS, the eShop was made available on the launch date of the [[Wii U]], although a system update is required in order to access it.<ref>[http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2012/11/wii_u_will_require_day_one_update_for_key_features Wii U Will Require Day One Update for Key Features \u2013 Wii U News @ Nintendo Life].

Retrieved on 23 August 2013.</ref> It is also a [[Computer multitasking|multitasking]] application, which means it is easily accessible even when a game is already running in the background through the system software, though this feature is exclusive to the Wii U and the Nintendo Switch. The Nintendo eShop features downloadable games, demos, applications, streaming videos, consumer rating feedback, and other information on upcoming game releases.\n\n== Features ==\nThe Nintendo eShop icon appears as part of the HOME Menu on the Wii U, Nintendo 3DS, and Nintendo Switch. It requires an Internet connection to access. Initially, the two versions of the Nintendo eShop between the Nintendo 3DS and Wii U were independent of each other. Whilst this still remains largely true, after the implementation of Nintendo Network ID for the Nintendo 3DS, users that register the same ID account between both systems (currently at one time per console) could share certain data between both versions of the eShop, such as a combined funds balance, home address, saved credit and debit card information, [[wish list]] entries, and (formerly) linked Club Nintendo accounts. With the release of the Nintendo Switch version of the Nintendo eShop, balance stored on a Nintendo Network ID can be shared or transferred to a Nintendo Account to be spent on the Nintendo Switch.\n\nThe eShop stores a record of all downloads and purchases, allowing users to re-download previously purchased software at no additional charge, provided the software is still available on the eShop. Downloads can be started immediately, or they can be queued up and be pushed to the console while it is not in use or when the eShop application is not running.<ref name=\"Kotaku\"/> Users upgrading from a [[Nintendo DSi]] system can transfer their previous DSiWare purchases to the Nintendo 3DS, with limited exceptions, such as ''Flipnote Studio'' and the DSi web browser.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.com/consumer/systems/3ds/en_na/gi_index.jsp?menu=applications%20and%20features&submenu=ctr-gi-apps-dsiware-wont-transfer|title=Nintendo 3DS \u2013 General Information|publisher=Nintendo|accessdate=6 August 2011}}</ref> A December 2011 update enabled a similar feature allowing users to transfer their purchases between 3DS systems.<ref>[http://www.ripten.com/2011/10/21/3ds-november-firmware-update-details/ 3DS November Firmware Update Detailed | RipTen Videogame Blog].

The limit on system transfers has since been permanently waived.\n\n=== Currency ===\nUnlike the [[Wii Shop Channel]] and the [[DSi Shop]] services, which use [[Nintendo Points]] for purchases, the Nintendo eShop (on the [[Nintendo 3DS family]], [[Wii U]], and [[Nintendo Switch]]) lists pricing in the appropriate regional currencies, such as [[US dollar|dollars]] and [[euro]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/features/6316665/the-3ds-eshop-what-you-need-to-know/?tag=updates%3Beditor%3Ball%3Btitle%3B4|title=The 3DS eShop: What You Need to Know|author=Giancarlo Varanini|work=GameSpot.com|publisher=CNet|date=2 June 2011|accessdate=7 November 2011}}</ref> Accounts can be funded using either credit cards or prepaid cards purchased in stores.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.com/consumer/systems/3ds/en_na/ht_apps.jsp|title=Nintendo 3DS \u2013 How To \u2013 Applications & Features|work=support.nintendo.com|accessdate=7 November 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn China, Nintendo eShop released on December 10, 2019. However, due to Mainland China version developed by [[Tencent Games]] instead, it can only log in with [[WeChat]] account, and the account can be funded only by [[WeChat Pay]]. Also, with the limited of Chinese Version Nintendo Switch, the online purchase of DLC for games from other regions is disabled.\n\n=== Multitasking ===\nThe Nintendo eShop can be accessed any time via the HOME menu screen, even when a game is already running. This feature, however, is only available on [[Wii U]] and [[Nintendo Switch]]. Background downloading is also possible via [[SpotPass]] while using any other application on the Wii U or Nintendo Switch, and while in Sleep Mode on [[Nintendo 3DS]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Narcisse|first=Evan|title=Nintendo Adding Playable Demos, eShop Web Interface and Sleep Mode Downloads to 3DS|url=http://kotaku.com/5854187/nintendo-adding-playable-demos-eshop-web-interface-and-sleep-mode-downloads-to-3ds|publisher=Kotaku}}</ref> Currently, 10 downloads can be queued at a time. The status of the downloads can be checked on the HOME menu under the \"Download Manager\". If notifications are activated, a pop-up message will appear in the top right corner of the screen to notify the user that a download is finished.\n\n=== Ratings ===\nThe Nintendo eShop supports user reviews of games, applications, and other media. After an eShop title has been acquired and used for at least one hour, users can then submit a review consisting of a crescent range of one to five \"stars\", representing the title's quality. Users can also categorize games by age and gender, and as being suitable for either hardcore or casual gamers. The Wii U had [[Miiverse]] integration for user reviews on the Nintendo eShop.\n\n=== Deluxe Digital Promotion and Nintendo Network Premium ===\n[[File:Nintendo Network Premium Logo.png|thumb|right|220px|Nintendo Network Premium logo]]\n{{main article|Nintendo Network}}\nOn September 13, 2012, during a Japanese [[Nintendo Direct]] presentation, Satoru Iwata introduced a new dimension to Nintendo's online offering, called Deluxe Digital Promotion (North America)/Nintendo Network Premium (Europe, Australia and Japan). It was a loyalty program similar to [[PlayStation Plus]] offered on [[PlayStation Network]] and Xbox Live Gold on [[Xbox Live]].\n\nConsumers who purchase the Wii U Deluxe Pack in North America, or the Wii U Premium Pack in Europe and Japan, will receive a free two-year subscription to this service which lets [[Wii U]] owners receive points for each digital purchase.\n\nMembers who buy games and apps through the Wii U Nintendo eShop will receive ten percent of the price back in the form of [[Nintendo Points]], which can subsequently be put towards future online purchases on both the Wii U and Nintendo 3DS eShop. The promotion was available through March 31, 2015.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\nThe program was discontinued on April 1, 2015 and the URL just leads to a discontinuation message and the reader gets a URL redirecting to Nintendo's official website. The service was never fully implemented beyond its promotional period, albeit succeeding the program [[My Nintendo]] features a similar concept for anyone who links their Nintendo Network ID to their Nintendo Account profile, where users can earn Gold Points via any Nintendo eShop purchase and redeem them for full downloads or discount coupons available.\n\n== List of available content ==\nThe following types of games, applications and media are available to download from the Nintendo eShop (or [[Wii Shop Channel]] in the Wii U's Wii Mode):\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The [[Wii U GamePad|GamePad]] is only compatible with these titles through [[Off-TV Play]].\n\nCurrently, select titles from the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]],  [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|SNES]], [[Nintendo 64]], [[Game Boy Advance]], and [[Nintendo DS]] libraries are available for purchase on the eShop. Most of the Virtual Console library available on the original Wii is also available on Wii U, but only through the implementation of the console's \"[[Wii]] Mode\" and [[Wii Shop Channel]], to access and purchase Virtual Console titles.

Special features in this interpretation of the Virtual Console allow players to create Restore Points, temporarily saving the game state for use later, and the optional ability to view games in their original resolution accompanied with special borders or templates.\n\nGBA Ambassador games like Nintendo DS and DSi games and DSiWare can be displayed at their original screen resolution but don't support: Sleep Mode (Certain GBA games can be put into sleep mode by button combinations or in menu options), Restore Points, Home Menu functionality, SpotPass, StreetPass, Multiplayer, and Auto Brightness (New Nintendo 3DS models only).\n\n== WiiWare ==\n{{main article|WiiWare}}\nWiiWare, for the [[Wii]] [[video game console]], has been available for the [[Wii U]] since launch day, when an update added support for the [[Wii Shop Channel]]'s library of WiiWare games.

With a few exceptions for certain games or applications such as ''[[Flipnote Studio]]'' and the DSi Internet Browser, the majority of existing DSiWare software is available for download on the Nintendo 3DS through the Nintendo eShop. Similar to using [[Nintendo DS]] software, DSiWare can be optionally viewed in its original resolution and [[Nintendo 3DS system software|Home Menu]] functionality, SpotPass, StreetPass, Auto Brightness (New Nintendo 3DS only) and 3D Functionality is disabled whilst DSiWare software is being played.

It requires an Internet connection to access. Initially, the two versions of the Nintendo eShop between the Nintendo 3DS and Wii U were independent of each other. Whilst this still remains largely true, after the implementation of Nintendo Network ID for the Nintendo 3DS, users that register the same ID account between both systems (currently at one time per console) could share certain data between both versions of the eShop, such as a combined funds balance, home address, saved credit and debit card information, [[wish list]] entries, and (formerly) linked Club Nintendo accounts. With the release of the Nintendo Switch version of the Nintendo eShop, balance stored on a Nintendo Network ID can be shared or transferred to a Nintendo Account to be spent on the Nintendo Switch.\n\nThe eShop stores a record of all downloads and purchases, allowing users to re-download previously purchased software at no additional charge, provided the software is still available on the eShop. Downloads can be started immediately, or they can be queued up and be pushed to the console while it is not in use or when the eShop application is not running.<ref name=\"Kotaku\"/> Users upgrading from a [[Nintendo DSi]] system can transfer their previous DSiWare purchases to the Nintendo 3DS, with limited exceptions, such as ''Flipnote Studio'' and the DSi web browser.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.com/consumer/systems/3ds/en_na/gi_index.jsp?menu=applications%20and%20features&submenu=ctr-gi-apps-dsiware-wont-transfer|title=Nintendo 3DS \u2013 General Information|publisher=Nintendo|accessdate=6 August 2011}}</ref> A December 2011 update enabled a similar feature allowing users to transfer their purchases between 3DS systems.<ref>[http://www.ripten.com/2011/10/21/3ds-november-firmware-update-details/ 3DS November Firmware Update Detailed | RipTen Videogame Blog].

The limit on system transfers has since been permanently waived.\n\n=== Currency ===\nUnlike the [[Wii Shop Channel]] and the [[DSi Shop]] services, which use [[Nintendo Points]] for purchases, the Nintendo eShop (on the [[Nintendo 3DS family]], [[Wii U]], and [[Nintendo Switch]]) lists pricing in the appropriate regional currencies, such as [[US dollar|dollars]] and [[euro]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/features/6316665/the-3ds-eshop-what-you-need-to-know/?tag=updates%3Beditor%3Ball%3Btitle%3B4|title=The 3DS eShop: What You Need to Know|author=Giancarlo Varanini|work=GameSpot.com|publisher=CNet|date=2 June 2011|accessdate=7 November 2011}}</ref> Accounts can be funded using either credit cards or prepaid cards purchased in stores.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.com/consumer/systems/3ds/en_na/ht_apps.jsp|title=Nintendo 3DS \u2013 How To \u2013 Applications & Features|work=support.nintendo.com|accessdate=7 November 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn China, Nintendo eShop released on December 10, 2019.

After an eShop title has been acquired and used for at least one hour, users can then submit a review consisting of a crescent range of one to five \"stars\", representing the title's quality. Users can also categorize games by age and gender, and as being suitable for either hardcore or casual gamers. The Wii U had [[Miiverse]] integration for user reviews on the Nintendo eShop.\n\n=== Deluxe Digital Promotion and Nintendo Network Premium ===\n[[File:Nintendo Network Premium Logo.png|thumb|right|220px|Nintendo Network Premium logo]]\n{{main article|Nintendo Network}}\nOn September 13, 2012, during a Japanese [[Nintendo Direct]] presentation, Satoru Iwata introduced a new dimension to Nintendo's online offering, called Deluxe Digital Promotion (North America)/Nintendo Network Premium (Europe, Australia and Japan). It was a loyalty program similar to [[PlayStation Plus]] offered on [[PlayStation Network]] and Xbox Live Gold on [[Xbox Live]].\n\nConsumers who purchase the Wii U Deluxe Pack in North America, or the Wii U Premium Pack in Europe and Japan, will receive a free two-year subscription to this service which lets [[Wii U]] owners receive points for each digital purchase.\n\nMembers who buy games and apps through the Wii U Nintendo eShop will receive ten percent of the price back in the form of [[Nintendo Points]], which can subsequently be put towards future online purchases on both the Wii U and Nintendo 3DS eShop. The promotion was available through March 31, 2015.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\nThe program was discontinued on April 1, 2015 and the URL just leads to a discontinuation message and the reader gets a URL redirecting to Nintendo's official website. The service was never fully implemented beyond its promotional period, albeit succeeding the program [[My Nintendo]] features a similar concept for anyone who links their Nintendo Network ID to their Nintendo Account profile, where users can earn Gold Points via any Nintendo eShop purchase and redeem them for full downloads or discount coupons available.\n\n== List of available content ==\nThe following types of games, applications and media are available to download from the Nintendo eShop (or [[Wii Shop Channel]] in the Wii U's Wii Mode):\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Various titles, which may be sold as retail games in some regions, might be released as download-only software in others for various reasons, such as cost-effective localisation.\n\n==== 3D Classics ====\n{{main article|3D Classics}}\n3D Classics are a series of [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]]/[[Famicom]], [[Arcade game|Arcade]] [[Sega Mega Drive]]/[[Sega Genesis|Genesis]] and [[Sega Master System]]/[[SG-1000]] games remade with added 3D functionality and updated features, although the overall graphics retain their original art style and appearance.

One of the most popular and the longest-running weekly sports series in the history of New Zealand, the show featured some of the country's top wrestlers and international stars from throughout the world during the 1970s and early 1980s.\n\nOn the Mat characterized the \"[[golden age (metaphor)|golden age]]\" of [[professional wrestling in New Zealand]] and made household names of promoter [[Steve Rickard]], [[John da Silva]], [[Robert Bruce (wrestler)|Robert Bruce]] and others during the 1970s. Much of the show's popularity was based on native New Zealanders and foreign wrestlers working together against their common enemies or, sometimes, being pitted against each other. Several New Zealand wrestlers such as [[Tony Garea]], [[Peter Maivia]], [[Siva Afi]] and [[The Bushwhackers|The Sheepherders]], partly from their television appearances, were brought over to the United States where they became major stars during the [[1980s wrestling boom]]. Likewise, wrestlers from the National Wrestling Alliance, [[Stampede Wrestling]], the [[World Wide Wrestling Federation]] and other foreign promotions were regulars on the show.\n\nAs a member of the National Wrestling Alliance, the [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship]] was defended on the show on several occasions, both between North American wrestlers and against New Zealanders, by legendary champions such as [[Harley Race]] and [[Ric Flair|\"The Nature Boy\" Ric Flair]]. Similarly, NWA storylines and feuds were played out on the program that would usually not have been seen in the US. In 1983, for example, the show aired what was a controversial ending to a best 2-of-3 falls match between Ric Flair and [[Mark Lewin]] in [[Auckland]] which saw the NWA World title momentarily change hands but was then returned to Flair via reverse decision. A year later, another NWA title change took place between Flair and Harley Race in [[Wellington]] and [[Geylang|Geylang, Singapore]] though these would not be officially recognized by the NWA for several years.\n\nIts cancellation in the early-1980s signaled the decline and eventual close of All Star Pro-Wrestling by the end of the decade. Apart from the short run of ''The Main Event'' made for TV3 in 1990, locally produced and televised professional wrestling would remain absent in New Zealand until the appearance of [[Impact Pro Wrestling]]'s ''[[IPW Ignition]]'' and Kiwi Pro Wrestling's ''[[Off the Ropes]]'' in the mid-2000s.\n\n==Show history==\n\n===Background===\n{{main|Professional wrestling in New Zealand}}\nIn the years following the [[Second World War]], professional wrestling in New Zealand became extremely popular reaching a high point in the 1950s. The death of longtime [[Dominion Wrestling Union]] promoter Walter Miller in 1959, however, caused the promotion to go into a slump as appearances from foreign wrestlers dwindled to only a small few each year. [[Steve Rickard]], one of its rising stars, continued to run the DWU for two years before starting his own promotion, All Star Pro-Wrestling, in 1962. Another New Zealand wrestler, [[John da Silva]],<ref name=\"Adams\">Adams, Yvette.

Rickard then decided to promote wrestling events full-time with All Star Pro-Wrestling.

According to Rickard, the promotion sold-out the Wellington Winter Show Buildings ten weeks in a row and still had to turn away hundreds more.<ref name=\"Webb\"/> Prior to the [[Television in New Zealand|introduction of television in New Zealand]] in 1960, wrestling had been extremely popular through live radio broadcasts. In the later years of the [[History of professional wrestling in the United States#Television era (1950s to 1970s)|\"television era\" of the 1970s and 80s]], television stations commonly aired professional wrestling, such as ''[[Hollywood Wrestling]]'' or ''[[Wrestling at the Chase]]'', as a source of inexpensive yet popular programing.<ref name=\"Byers\"/>\n\nEncouraged by successful wrestling shows in Australia and the US, Rickard recorded a [[film pilot]] at a cost of $500 using matches from one of his shows at the Wellington Winter Show Buildings in 1973. This included a [[midget wrestling]] match and another with American wrestler [[Harley Race]]. Rickard initially approached [[TV1 (New Zealand)|TV1]] and used the pilot to \"[[pitch (filmmaking)|pitch]]\" the idea for a New Zealand-based professional wrestling program. The network showed little interest in the show and eventually passed on the idea. When [[TV2 (New Zealand)|TV2]] was established two years later, however, Rickard managed to get a meeting with then programme director Kevan Moore. A deal was quickly made and Rickard worked with [[South Pacific Pictures]] to develop and produce this new wrestling program.<ref name=\"NZOS\"/><ref name=\"Gough\">{{cite web |url=http://www.thesellnetwork.com/misc/Globalisation.pdf |title=The Globalisation of Professional Wrestling and its affect on the New Zealand Wrestling Scene |author=Gough, Shanan |date=12 June 2010 |publisher=TheSellNetwork.com |accessdate=2 August 2010}}</ref> Tim Bickerstaff, a popular New Zealand radio personality and television sports writer, was involved in filming early episodes of the show.<ref name=\"Bickerstaff\">{{cite web |url=http://www.xtrasite.co.nz/sport/bickers/past/990219.html |title=Pro Wrestling \u2013 Believe It Or Not |author=Bickerstaff, Tim |date=19 February 1999 |publisher=Xtrasite.co.nz |accessdate=2 August 2010}}</ref>\n\nOn the Mat debuted as a half-hour late night series on [[Television New Zealand]]'s [[TV2 (New Zealand)|TV2]] in early July 1975.<ref name=\"LOTM\">{{cite book|last1=Mancer|first1=John|title=Steve Rickard's Life On the Mat|date=1979|publisher=Rugby Press|location=Auckland|isbn=978-0-9597553-4-3|pages=142|edition=1st}}</ref> The show was hosted by [[colour commentator]] [[Ernie Leonard]] along with Steve Rickard as the [[play-by-play announcer]].

Rickard promoted both Maivia and Afi to appeal to the [[Polynesia]]n market in New Zealand much in the same way [[Vince McMahon, Sr.]] did with [[Bruno Sammartino]] and [[Italian American]]s in New York during the 1960s. In 1978, Afi defeated John da Silva in a tournament final to capture the [[NWA New Zealand Heavyweight Championship]] on 23 April 1978. It was the first time a [[Samoans|Samoan]] wrestler had held the New Zealand championship since 1964.<ref name=\"Titles\"/><ref name=\"NewZealandTitle\"/><ref name=\"Afi\"/> A year later, Miavia won the [[NWA British Empire/Commonwealth Championship (New Zealand version)|NWA British Empire/Commonwealth Championship]] from Ripper Collins in Auckland.<ref name=\"Titles\"/><ref name=\"BCTitle\"/>\n\nAt the start of the show's off-season each year, Rickard and his wrestlers spent the three months on international tours overseas in the [[Middle East]], India, [[Singapore]], [[Malaysia]], [[Pakistan]], [[Thailand]], [[Hong Kong]] and [[Hawaii]].<ref name=\"Webb\"/>\n\n===Height in popularity===\nOn the Mat's success greatly increased attendance for live events throughout the country. Imported talent coming as far away as the United States, Canada, Japan and Australia to challenge local wrestlers, particularly ones that fans could identify with and relate to, kept viewers tuning in each week.<ref name=\"Gough\"/> The show's popularity also brought the first television exposure to New Zealand stars and, due in part to their TV appearances for On the Mat, [[Peter Maivia]], [[Tony Garea]] and [[The Bushwhackers|The Sheepherders]] were all brought to the US where they became major stars in the NWA and the [[World Wide Wrestling Federation]] in the 1970s, and later in the [[World Wrestling Federation]] during the [[1980s wrestling boom]]. WWWF stars such as [[Don Muraco]], [[Toru Tanaka]], [[Mr. Fuji]]<ref name=\"Solomon\"/><ref name=\"Afi\"/> and [[Rocky Johnson]]<ref>Gorman, Jacqueline Laks. ''Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson''. Pleasantville, New York: Gareth Stevens Publishing, 2007. (pg. 13) {{ISBN|0-8368-8200-8}}</ref> also appeared on the show while touring the country.\n\nOriginal storylines, apart from the NWA, were also featured in the show. Robert Bruce, who had originally come to New Zealand as a [[face (professional wrestling)|fan favourite]], \"[[Heel (professional wrestling)|turned heel]]\", reformed as a \"face\" then returned to being a heel within the span of a few weeks. His antics gained himself and others national attention<ref>{{cite news |title=Wrestler, acting agent Bruce dies aged 65 |author=Ihaka, James |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |date=2 March 2009 |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10559577 }}</ref> and enraged crowds so much that he was actually stabbed by an irate fan.<ref>{{cite news |title=Robert Bruce: 'Bad guy' of wrestling spent his life helping others |author=Ihaka, James |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |date=3 March 2009 |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/wrestling/news/article.cfm?c_id=490&objectid=10559601 }}</ref> Rickard's two sons were also involved in the promotion. One episode in 1980 featured a tag team match with [[Ricky Rickard]] as a participant, his brother Tony Rickard refereeing the match and their father Steve Rickard commentating. The show sometimes featured celebrity guests, most notably, radio personality [[Billy T. James]].<ref name=\"Byers\"/>\n\nOn 17 March 1981, Barry Holland officially took over Ernie Leonard's position as head announcer so Leonard could work full-time behind the scenes in his role as producer. Returning from a period of touring [[Southeast Asia]] and [[Africa]], Steve Rickard announced the show was being aired in [[Kenya]], [[Tanzania]], [[Hong Kong]] and [[Malaysia]] as well as the arrivals of [[Abdullah the Butcher]], [[Bret Hart]], and possibly [[Ed Farhat|\"The Original Sheik\" Ed Farhat]]. Also on that episode, Rickard read aloud a letter sent to him by Larry O'Day in which the Australian wrestler taunted Rickard over breaking the leg of his son earlier that year and publicly accepted O'Day's challenge to a match for the [[NWA British Empire/Commonwealth Championship (New Zealand version)|NWA British Empire/Commonwealth Championship]].<ref name=\"Byers\"/> A month after the death of [[Peter Maivia]], the 6 July 1982 edition of \"On the Mat\" was a tribute show in his memory and the promotion broadcast two of his matches.<ref name=\"WAWLI\">{{cite web |url=http://www.wrestlingclassics.com/wawli/New211-220.htm |title=\u2018Laughing Killer\u2019 They All Loved |date=3 July 1982 |work=THE NEW WAWLI (Wrestling As We Liked It) PAPERS No. 211-2001 |publisher=WrestlingClassics.com |accessdate=2 August 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Involvement with the NWA===\nAn official member of the NWA since 1972, many of its top stars were featured on the program when they visited New Zealand. As a result, NWA storylines and feuds not only became part of the show but were usually not seen by fans outside the country. This was especially true of title defences for the [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship]], defended on the show on several occasions, involving both foreign and native New Zealand wrestlers.\n\n[[Peter Maivia]] very nearly won the title from then reigning champion [[Harley Race]] in [[Western Springs]] in 1979,<ref name=\"Solomon\"/> winning the bout via disqualification, and there was a serious concern the estimated 10,000 fans in attendance<ref name=\"Gough\"/> would riot if Maivia did not address the crowd to explain why the NWA did not allow title changes based on a disqualification win.<ref name=\"Gough\"/><ref>''Auckland Star'', 28 February 1979, p. 31.</ref> A 30-minute NWA title match between Race and Rick Martel took up an entire episode of On the Mat.

Although he scored the winning pinfall, and was given the belt, the decision was reversed by referees due to Flair having been tossed over the top rope moments before. Although this was not an illegal move in New Zealand, the bout was under NWA regulations and referees were forced to disqualify Lewin.

The [[World Wrestling Federation]]'s national expansion under [[Vince McMahon]] in the US resulted in the [[National Wrestling Alliance#Decline of the territory system|decline of the National Wrestling Alliance]] and made the top American stars less available to travel outside the US.<ref name=\"Venter\"/> Rickard and [[World Championship Wrestling (Australia)|World Championship Wrestling]] had also long shared the transportation costs of bringing in foreign wrestlers into the Pacific, however, the close of WCW in 1978 resulted in Rickard taking on the full cost himself. Even local stars such as Peter Maivia and Siva Afi, despite their popularity in New Zealand, left the country to compete in the US.<ref name=\"Gough\"/>\n\nThe high costs of running the show, in addition to a worsening economy in New Zealand, forced Rickard to cancel the show in 1984. The final episode aired on 23 July 1984, and featured [[Samoan Joe]], Larry O'Day, Mel Fortuna, Tony Rickard and Rip Morgan.<ref>{{cite news |title=Crazy capers in What's Up, Doc? |work=[[New Straits Times]] |date=23 July 1984 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=8aNUAAAAIBAJ&sjid=6o8DAAAAIBAJ&pg=6722,4818732&dq=samoan-joe+-samoa-joe&hl=en }}</ref> He and All Star Pro-Wrestling attempted a couple of tours during the next two years but the show's cancellation eventually saw the close of his promotion.<ref name=\"Venter\"/>\n\n==Production==\nThe show usually aired on a [[Late night television|late night timeslot]] each week on Tuesdays and was approximately 24\u201325 minutes in length (produced for a 30-minute time-slot) per episode. The first 14 episodes were taped in Auckland, and in Hamilton for a short time, before settling in at the Canterbury Court Stadium in [[Christchurch]]. The final season in 1983\u201384 was shot at the Auckland YMCA. The show was not only a ratings success, it also helped promote live events which sold out town halls and other venues throughout the country on a weekly basis. By the time the show ended, Rickard estimated he had promoted shows in 135 New Zealand cities and towns.<ref name=\"Venter\"/>\n\n===Episode format===\nEach episode opened with a video of the All Star Pro-Wrestlers competing in various matches as well as the show's theme song, before going to an introduction and the opening match. An episode typically featured two to three [[Professional wrestling match types|matches]] (and sometimes footage from a recent live event or match from overseas) as well as [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Promo|post-match interviews]] and [[Vignette (literature)|vignettes]] from wrestlers regarding their upcoming matches or current storylines. Celebrity guests were often invited to the show where they were later interviewed by one of the hosts such as comedian and radio personality [[Billy T. James]] in 1980. The show typically ended after the main event (the final match on an episode) and closed similar to the opening credits.\n\n===Memorable episodes===\n{| border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #FCFDFF; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\"\n!Episode||Date||Rating||Notes\n|-\n|''On the Mat'' Debut\n|July 1975<ref name=\"LOTM\" />\n|N/A\n|{{small|The first ever On the Mat episode.}}\n|-\n|Harley Race NWA World Title defence\n|1979\n|N/A\n|{{small|[[Sivi Afi]] unsuccessfully challenged [[Harley Race]] for the [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship]].}}\n|-\n|''On the Mat'' with Billy T.

Ring Announcer || Dates\n|-\n|Burt Durn\n|1975-c. 1984\n|}\n\n==Revival with \"The Main Event\"==\nIn 1990, Steve Rickard proposed a new wrestling program under a similar format and, supported by Isambard Productions, secured a deal with the newly established [[TV3 (New Zealand)|TV3]] to air \u201cThe Main Event\u201d that year. The show was filmed at ASB Stadium in Auckland and the first episode aired in May. The show's producers attempted to replicate the high production values of the [[World Wrestling Federation]]'s ''[[WWF Superstars of Wrestling]]'', which had premiered on [[TV2 (New Zealand)|TV2]] the previous year to high ratings, but also clashed with the more basic and traditional style of \"On the Mat\".<ref name=\"Gough\"/><ref name=\"Ward\"/>\n\nAiring on a slightly earlier timeslot than ''WWF Superstars'', it was technically not in head-to-head competition, however its attempt to emulate the [[sports entertainment]] aspect of the WWF failed to impress neither the critics nor fans. Gus Forearm, a columnist for the ''[[Sunday News (New Zealand)|Sunday News]]'', wrote \"Okay, it is filmed in New Zealand \u2013 but it lacks any of the gloss and zap we've become used to, thanks to TVNZ's Superstars of Wrestling show and many of the NWA wrestlers on the show simply don\u2019t rate on the Forearm scale of skill\".<ref name=\"Gough\"/>\n\nThe hiring of John Dybvig, a former US basketball coach and commentator, was the main \"heel\" announcer who portrayed a [[Ugly American (epithet)|stereotypical \"loudmouth\" American]].<ref name=\"Ward\"/> His unpopularity, however, did not come from his on-air persona but rather his lack of knowledge about professional wrestling and is believed to have also hurt the show in the long run.<ref name=\"Gough\"/>\n\nA WWF tour of Christchurch, Wellington and Auckland had drawn over 15,000 people and it was expected that the costs of filming such a high-cost show could be offset by profits made from the gate takings at the ASB Stadium but attendance was much less than expected. In the end, The Main Event was unable to compete with the WWF for ratings and was cancelled after 11 episodes.<ref name=\"Gough\"/>\n\nLike the final years of \"On the Mat\", Siva Afi was the main star of the program. Returning from a brief stint in the WWF, it was his first major appearance in the country since 1978.<ref name=\"Gough\"/> On 13 July 1990, he defeated Canadian Stockman for the [[NWA British Empire/Commonwealth Championship (New Zealand version)|NWA British Empire/Commonwealth Championship]] and remained undefeated throughout the series. After The Main Event's cancellation, the NWA British Empire/Commonwealth title was retired after a 60-year history.<ref name=\"BCTitle\"/>\n\n==Legacy==\nOver 20 years after its cancellation, On the Mat has remained the longest-running weekly sports series in New Zealand's history. It has since achieved a [[cult status]] in [[Culture of New Zealand|New Zealand popular culture]] and has been an influencing factor among several New Zealand media personalities. [[Wallace Chapman]], co-host of the political interview show ''[[Back Benches]]'', has said his \"favourite TV moment\" was watching \"On the Mat\" as a child.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tvnz.co.nz/cheers-to-50-years/my-favourite-moment-part-4-3530983 |title='My favourite moment is...'

One of the most popular and the longest-running weekly sports series in the history of New Zealand, the show featured some of the country's top wrestlers and international stars from throughout the world during the 1970s and early 1980s.\n\nOn the Mat characterized the \"[[golden age (metaphor)|golden age]]\" of [[professional wrestling in New Zealand]] and made household names of promoter [[Steve Rickard]], [[John da Silva]], [[Robert Bruce (wrestler)|Robert Bruce]] and others during the 1970s. Much of the show's popularity was based on native New Zealanders and foreign wrestlers working together against their common enemies or, sometimes, being pitted against each other. Several New Zealand wrestlers such as [[Tony Garea]], [[Peter Maivia]], [[Siva Afi]] and [[The Bushwhackers|The Sheepherders]], partly from their television appearances, were brought over to the United States where they became major stars during the [[1980s wrestling boom]]. Likewise, wrestlers from the National Wrestling Alliance, [[Stampede Wrestling]], the [[World Wide Wrestling Federation]] and other foreign promotions were regulars on the show.\n\nAs a member of the National Wrestling Alliance, the [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship]] was defended on the show on several occasions, both between North American wrestlers and against New Zealanders, by legendary champions such as [[Harley Race]] and [[Ric Flair|\"The Nature Boy\" Ric Flair]]. Similarly, NWA storylines and feuds were played out on the program that would usually not have been seen in the US. In 1983, for example, the show aired what was a controversial ending to a best 2-of-3 falls match between Ric Flair and [[Mark Lewin]] in [[Auckland]] which saw the NWA World title momentarily change hands but was then returned to Flair via reverse decision. A year later, another NWA title change took place between Flair and Harley Race in [[Wellington]] and [[Geylang|Geylang, Singapore]] though these would not be officially recognized by the NWA for several years.\n\nIts cancellation in the early-1980s signaled the decline and eventual close of All Star Pro-Wrestling by the end of the decade. Apart from the short run of ''The Main Event'' made for TV3 in 1990, locally produced and televised professional wrestling would remain absent in New Zealand until the appearance of [[Impact Pro Wrestling]]'s ''[[IPW Ignition]]'' and Kiwi Pro Wrestling's ''[[Off the Ropes]]'' in the mid-2000s.\n\n==Show history==\n\n===Background===\n{{main|Professional wrestling in New Zealand}}\nIn the years following the [[Second World War]], professional wrestling in New Zealand became extremely popular reaching a high point in the 1950s. The death of longtime [[Dominion Wrestling Union]] promoter Walter Miller in 1959, however, caused the promotion to go into a slump as appearances from foreign wrestlers dwindled to only a small few each year. [[Steve Rickard]], one of its rising stars, continued to run the DWU for two years before starting his own promotion, All Star Pro-Wrestling, in 1962. Another New Zealand wrestler, [[John da Silva]],<ref name=\"Adams\">Adams, Yvette.

Rickard then decided to promote wrestling events full-time with All Star Pro-Wrestling.

According to Rickard, the promotion sold-out the Wellington Winter Show Buildings ten weeks in a row and still had to turn away hundreds more.<ref name=\"Webb\"/> Prior to the [[Television in New Zealand|introduction of television in New Zealand]] in 1960, wrestling had been extremely popular through live radio broadcasts. In the later years of the [[History of professional wrestling in the United States#Television era (1950s to 1970s)|\"television era\" of the 1970s and 80s]], television stations commonly aired professional wrestling, such as ''[[Hollywood Wrestling]]'' or ''[[Wrestling at the Chase]]'', as a source of inexpensive yet popular programing.<ref name=\"Byers\"/>\n\nEncouraged by successful wrestling shows in Australia and the US, Rickard recorded a [[film pilot]] at a cost of $500 using matches from one of his shows at the Wellington Winter Show Buildings in 1973. This included a [[midget wrestling]] match and another with American wrestler [[Harley Race]]. Rickard initially approached [[TV1 (New Zealand)|TV1]] and used the pilot to \"[[pitch (filmmaking)|pitch]]\" the idea for a New Zealand-based professional wrestling program. The network showed little interest in the show and eventually passed on the idea. When [[TV2 (New Zealand)|TV2]] was established two years later, however, Rickard managed to get a meeting with then programme director Kevan Moore. A deal was quickly made and Rickard worked with [[South Pacific Pictures]] to develop and produce this new wrestling program.<ref name=\"NZOS\"/><ref name=\"Gough\">{{cite web |url=http://www.thesellnetwork.com/misc/Globalisation.pdf |title=The Globalisation of Professional Wrestling and its affect on the New Zealand Wrestling Scene |author=Gough, Shanan |date=12 June 2010 |work= |publisher=TheSellNetwork.com |accessdate=2 August 2010}}</ref> Tim Bickerstaff, a popular New Zealand radio personality and television sports writer, was involved in filming early episodes of the show.<ref name=\"Bickerstaff\">{{cite web |url=http://www.xtrasite.co.nz/sport/bickers/past/990219.html |title=Pro Wrestling \u2013 Believe It Or Not |author=Bickerstaff, Tim |date=19 February 1999 |work= |publisher=Xtrasite.co.nz |accessdate=2 August 2010}}</ref>\n\nOn the Mat debuted as a half-hour late night series on [[Television New Zealand]]'s [[TV2 (New Zealand)|TV2]] in early July 1975.<ref name=\"LOTM\">{{cite book|last1=Mancer|first1=John|title=Steve Rickard's Life On the Mat|date=1979|publisher=Rugby Press|location=Auckland|isbn=978-0-9597553-4-3|pages=142|edition=1st}}</ref> The show was hosted by [[colour commentator]] [[Ernie Leonard]] along with Steve Rickard as the [[play-by-play announcer]].

Rickard promoted both Maivia and Afi to appeal to the [[Polynesia]]n market in New Zealand much in the same way [[Vince McMahon, Sr.]] did with [[Bruno Sammartino]] and [[Italian American]]s in New York during the 1960s. In 1978, Afi defeated John da Silva in a tournament final to capture the [[NWA New Zealand Heavyweight Championship]] on 23 April 1978. It was the first time a [[Samoans|Samoan]] wrestler had held the New Zealand championship since 1964.<ref name=\"Titles\"/><ref name=\"NewZealandTitle\"/><ref name=\"Afi\"/> A year later, Miavia won the [[NWA British Empire/Commonwealth Championship (New Zealand version)|NWA British Empire/Commonwealth Championship]] from Ripper Collins in Auckland.<ref name=\"Titles\"/><ref name=\"BCTitle\"/>\n\nAt the start of the show's off-season each year, Rickard and his wrestlers spent the three months on international tours overseas in the [[Middle East]], India, [[Singapore]], [[Malaysia]], [[Pakistan]], [[Thailand]], [[Hong Kong]] and [[Hawaii]].<ref name=\"Webb\"/>\n\n===Height in popularity===\nOn the Mat's success greatly increased attendance for live events throughout the country. Imported talent coming as far away as the United States, Canada, Japan and Australia to challenge local wrestlers, particularly ones that fans could identify with and relate to, kept viewers tuning in each week.<ref name=\"Gough\"/> The show's popularity also brought the first television exposure to New Zealand stars and, due in part to their TV appearances for On the Mat, [[Peter Maivia]], [[Tony Garea]] and [[The Bushwhackers|The Sheepherders]] were all brought to the US where they became major stars in the NWA and the [[World Wide Wrestling Federation]] in the 1970s, and later in the [[World Wrestling Federation]] during the [[1980s wrestling boom]].

Robert Bruce, who had originally come to New Zealand as a [[face (professional wrestling)|fan favourite]], \"[[Heel (professional wrestling)|turned heel]]\", reformed as a \"face\" then returned to being a heel within the span of a few weeks. His antics gained himself and others national attention<ref>{{cite news |title=Wrestler, acting agent Bruce dies aged 65 |author=Ihaka, James |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |date=2 March 2009 |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10559577 }}</ref> and enraged crowds so much that he was actually stabbed by an irate fan.<ref>{{cite news |title=Robert Bruce: 'Bad guy' of wrestling spent his life helping others |author=Ihaka, James |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |date=3 March 2009 |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/wrestling/news/article.cfm?c_id=490&objectid=10559601 }}</ref> Rickard's two sons were also involved in the promotion. One episode in 1980 featured a tag team match with [[Ricky Rickard]] as a participant, his brother Tony Rickard refereeing the match and their father Steve Rickard commentating. The show sometimes featured celebrity guests, most notably, radio personality [[Billy T. James]].<ref name=\"Byers\"/>\n\nOn 17 March 1981, Barry Holland officially took over Ernie Leonard's position as head announcer so Leonard could work full-time behind the scenes in his role as producer. Returning from a period of touring [[Southeast Asia]] and [[Africa]], Steve Rickard announced the show was being aired in [[Kenya]], [[Tanzania]], [[Hong Kong]] and [[Malaysia]] as well as the arrivals of [[Abdullah the Butcher]], [[Bret Hart]], and possibly [[Ed Farhat|\"The Original Sheik\" Ed Farhat]]. Also on that episode, Rickard read aloud a letter sent to him by Larry O'Day in which the Australian wrestler taunted Rickard over breaking the leg of his son earlier that year and publicly accepted O'Day's challenge to a match for the [[NWA British Empire/Commonwealth Championship (New Zealand version)|NWA British Empire/Commonwealth Championship]].<ref name=\"Byers\"/> A month after the death of [[Peter Maivia]], the 6 July 1982 edition of \"On the Mat\" was a tribute show in his memory and the promotion broadcast two of his matches.<ref name=\"WAWLI\">{{cite web |url=http://www.wrestlingclassics.com/wawli/New211-220.htm |title=\u2018Laughing Killer\u2019 They All Loved |author= |date=3 July 1982 |work=THE NEW WAWLI (Wrestling As We Liked It) PAPERS No. 211-2001 |publisher=WrestlingClassics.com |accessdate=2 August 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Involvement with the NWA===\nAn official member of the NWA since 1972, many of its top stars were featured on the program when they visited New Zealand. As a result, NWA storylines and feuds not only became part of the show but were usually not seen by fans outside the country. This was especially true of title defences for the [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship]], defended on the show on several occasions, involving both foreign and native New Zealand wrestlers.\n\n[[Peter Maivia]] very nearly won the title from then reigning champion [[Harley Race]] in [[Western Springs]] in 1979,<ref name=\"Solomon\"/> winning the bout via disqualification, and there was a serious concern the estimated 10,000 fans in attendance<ref name=\"Gough\"/> would riot if Maivia did not address the crowd to explain why the NWA did not allow title changes based on a disqualification win.<ref name=\"Gough\"/><ref>''Auckland Star'', 28 February 1979, p. 31.</ref> A 30-minute NWA title match between Race and Rick Martel took up an entire episode of On the Mat.

Although he scored the winning pinfall, and was given the belt, the decision was reversed by referees due to Flair having been tossed over the top rope moments before. Although this was not an illegal move in New Zealand, the bout was under NWA regulations and referees were forced to disqualify Lewin.

The [[World Wrestling Federation]]'s national expansion under [[Vince McMahon]] in the US resulted in the [[National Wrestling Alliance#Decline of the territory system|decline of the National Wrestling Alliance]] and made the top American stars less available to travel outside the US.<ref name=\"Venter\"/> Rickard and [[World Championship Wrestling (Australia)|World Championship Wrestling]] had also long shared the transportation costs of bringing in foreign wrestlers into the Pacific, however, the close of WCW in 1978 resulted in Rickard taking on the full cost himself. Even local stars such as Peter Maivia and Siva Afi, despite their popularity in New Zealand, left the country to compete in the US.<ref name=\"Gough\"/>\n\nThe high costs of running the show, in addition to a worsening economy in New Zealand, forced Rickard to cancel the show in 1984. The final episode aired on 23 July 1984, and featured [[Samoan Joe]], Larry O'Day, Mel Fortuna, Tony Rickard and Rip Morgan.<ref>{{cite news |title=Crazy capers in What's Up, Doc? |author= |work=[[New Straits Times]] |date=23 July 1984 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=8aNUAAAAIBAJ&sjid=6o8DAAAAIBAJ&pg=6722,4818732&dq=samoan-joe+-samoa-joe&hl=en }}</ref> He and All Star Pro-Wrestling attempted a couple of tours during the next two years but the show's cancellation eventually saw the close of his promotion.<ref name=\"Venter\"/>\n\n==Production==\nThe show usually aired on a [[Late night television|late night timeslot]] each week on Tuesdays and was approximately 24\u201325 minutes in length (produced for a 30-minute time-slot) per episode. The first 14 episodes were taped in Auckland, and in Hamilton for a short time, before settling in at the Canterbury Court Stadium in [[Christchurch]]. The final season in 1983\u201384 was shot at the Auckland YMCA. The show was not only a ratings success, it also helped promote live events which sold out town halls and other venues throughout the country on a weekly basis.

An episode typically featured two to three [[Professional wrestling match types|matches]] (and sometimes footage from a recent live event or match from overseas) as well as [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Promo|post-match interviews]] and [[Vignette (literature)|vignettes]] from wrestlers regarding their upcoming matches or current storylines. Celebrity guests were often invited to the show where they were later interviewed by one of the hosts such as comedian and radio personality [[Billy T. James]] in 1980.

Ring Announcer || Dates\n|-\n|Burt Durn\n|1975-c. 1984\n|}\n\n==Revival with \"The Main Event\"==\nIn 1990, Steve Rickard proposed a new wrestling program under a similar format and, supported by Isambard Productions, secured a deal with the newly established [[TV3 (New Zealand)|TV3]] to air \u201cThe Main Event\u201d that year. The show was filmed at ASB Stadium in Auckland and the first episode aired in May. The show's producers attempted to replicate the high production values of the [[World Wrestling Federation]]'s ''[[WWF Superstars of Wrestling]]'', which had premiered on [[TV2 (New Zealand)|TV2]] the previous year to high ratings, but also clashed with the more basic and traditional style of \"On the Mat\".<ref name=\"Gough\"/><ref name=\"Ward\"/>\n\nAiring on a slightly earlier timeslot than ''WWF Superstars'', it was technically not in head-to-head competition, however its attempt to emulate the [[sports entertainment]] aspect of the WWF failed to impress neither the critics nor fans. Gus Forearm, a columnist for the ''[[Sunday News (New Zealand)|Sunday News]]'', wrote \"Okay, it is filmed in New Zealand \u2013 but it lacks any of the gloss and zap we've become used to, thanks to TVNZ's Superstars of Wrestling show and many of the NWA wrestlers on the show simply don\u2019t rate on the Forearm scale of skill\".<ref name=\"Gough\"/>\n\nThe hiring of John Dybvig, a former US basketball coach and commentator, was the main \"heel\" announcer who portrayed a [[Ugly American (epithet)|stereotypical \"loudmouth\" American]].<ref name=\"Ward\"/> His unpopularity, however, did not come from his on-air persona but rather his lack of knowledge about professional wrestling and is believed to have also hurt the show in the long run.<ref name=\"Gough\"/>\n\nA WWF tour of Christchurch, Wellington and Auckland had drawn over 15,000 people and it was expected that the costs of filming such a high-cost show could be offset by profits made from the gate takings at the ASB Stadium but attendance was much less than expected. In the end, The Main Event was unable to compete with the WWF for ratings and was cancelled after 11 episodes.<ref name=\"Gough\"/>\n\nLike the final years of \"On the Mat\", Siva Afi was the main star of the program. Returning from a brief stint in the WWF, it was his first major appearance in the country since 1978.<ref name=\"Gough\"/> On 13 July 1990, he defeated Canadian Stockman for the [[NWA British Empire/Commonwealth Championship (New Zealand version)|NWA British Empire/Commonwealth Championship]] and remained undefeated throughout the series. After The Main Event's cancellation, the NWA British Empire/Commonwealth title was retired after a 60-year history.<ref name=\"BCTitle\"/>\n\n==Legacy==\nOver 20 years after its cancellation, On the Mat has remained the longest-running weekly sports series in New Zealand's history. It has since achieved a [[cult status]] in [[Culture of New Zealand|New Zealand popular culture]] and has been an influencing factor among several New Zealand media personalities. [[Wallace Chapman]], co-host of the political interview show ''[[Back Benches]]'', has said his \"favourite TV moment\" was watching \"On the Mat\" as a child.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tvnz.co.nz/cheers-to-50-years/my-favourite-moment-part-4-3530983 |title='My favourite moment is...'

The sand at Forvie is formed from the remains of sediment that was transported by rivers to the coast at the end of the last [[Ice Age]].

The southernmost point of the reserve consists of a sand [[Spit (landform)|spit]] at the point where the River Ythan enters the sea. To the north the sand rests on [[raised beach]]es terraces and glaciated rocks. North of this region is an area where the sand lies on top of a rock plateau, with glacial deposits of varying depths sandwiched between the rock and the sand.<ref name=p9/> The dunes are highly mobile, and can reach up to 20&nbsp;m in height. As there is relatively little plant life on these mobile dunes, they have been likened to the [[Sahara Desert]].<ref name=p10>The Story of Forvie National Nature Reserve. p. 10.</ref>\n\n==Flora and fauna==\n[[File:Roosting waders on the Sands of Forvie National Nature Reserve - geograph.org.uk - 618304.jpg|Roosting waders on the Sands of Forvie|thumb]]\nThe reserve contains large areas of sandy foreshore, mobile and fixed [[dune]]s, dune pasture and lowland heath and the successional development of vegetation.

In 2003 SNH bought 65&nbsp;% of the reserve (653&nbsp;ha), and in 2012 SNH bought the remaining land.<ref name=p22>The Story of Forvie National Nature Reserve. p. 22.</ref>\n\n===During the World Wars===\n{{more citations needed|section|date=January 2019}}\nForvie was active in World Wars I and II, although very few details are recorded on the use of the area. It was incorrectly claimed {{by whom|date=January 2019}} there was a nine-hole golf course from 1900 to the outbreak of World War II. The course built for Lady Cathcart in 1900 was on the west coast island Uist.\n\nThe layout of Forvie and Newburgh could be mistaken for the mouth of the River Don in Aberdeen. With this is mind, defences were put in places around the mouth of the Ythan. These consisted of pill boxes, two gun batteries and anti-tank blocks built by the 143rd Pioneer Corps.  From a review of vulnerable beaches from April\u2013October 1941, Forvie appeared on this list and was identified as \"blocked with mines\". The minefield ran from East to West (WO ref 31/521474 to 538472). These were British Type C land mines weighing about 65&nbsp;lbs each. Following a clear up of the area in July 1944, a number of landmines were unaccounted for due to the shifting sands of the area. Mine clearance altered the area slightly as the Bomb Disposal Unit from the Royal Engineers used a converted Bren gun carrier (known as a wasp) as a flamethrower to scorch vegetation on the mined area. Images of the clearance and the location of the minefield is recorded in a local book covering World War 2 in NE Scotland.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.buchanobserver.co.uk/news/buchan-at-war-book-published-1-4730323|title=Buchan at war book published|newspaper=Buchan Observer|date=2018-04-25|accessdate=2019-01-31}}</ref> Records show on some days 222 mines being dealt with, the actual mine count is unknown but the area took several months to clear. on 27 July 1944, Sapper Harry Dean (28) of 11 coy, Royal Engineers was killed whilst clearing a mine at Forvie. Sapper Dean is buried in Yorkshire <ref>http://www.royalengineersbombdisposal-eod.org.uk/dean_h.html</ref>\n\n[[File:Forvie minefield.jpg|thumb|Minefield start / end from Royal Engineers file in TNA - Kew]]\nForvie sands was used to train the Gordon Highlanders and Highland Light Infantry in desert warfare, in addition to this Forvie Moor was used to train soldiers in the use of grenade, anti-tank grenades and 2\" trench mortars.  Since the war, mortar bombs have been found across the moor.  Craters are still visible in the area. The soldiers training at Forvie were billeted at the Slains Lodge and buildings in Collieston.\n\nOn 3 November 1940, 30 High Explosive Bombs were dropped on Forvie Links by the luftwaffe.  This is listed in the Aberdeenshire Civil Defence register, the craters can be seen in 1941 and 1946 aerial photos.\n\nWhilst soldiers were training there, the moor were off limits to locals. However, on Sundays, the locals could use the moor. During this time, locals collected birds eggs to use as food was rationed, and there was a plentiful supply of rabbits.  On Sunday 30 November 1941, three local boys found an unexploded anti-tank grenade in a rabbit burrow that the army had been demonstrating to the home guard.  One of the boys (Alex Ross), then threw it away where it exploded causing him to lose sight in one eye.\n\nOn 31 March 1941, the British steamer ''Melrose Abbey'' ran aground. On 2 April 1941 she was hit by a drifting sea mine blowing a large hole in her side, and settled on the Ythan river bed. During this time, a machine gun was posted at Forvie Sands to offer some protection for the vessel whilst plans were made to move her as she was a target for passing aircraft. The ship was refloated on 26 July 1941 and towed to Aberdeen for repairs. She was later sunk by U-356 on 27 December 1942 north-east of the Azores. Several websites confirm this sinking, but this disagrees with the information in the reference below, which states that \"As for Melrose Abbey, she was released from the Royal Navy in May 1945 and returned to her former owners, the Associated Humber Lines.\"  The second reference may help to resolve this mix-up of ship names.\n\nBeside the pill box of Forvie, two mobile naval 4\" guns were places and controlled by 942nd Defence battery.\n\nOn 26 January 1942, the ''SS Lesrix'', which was carrying machinery, ran aground off Hackley head during a blizzard. Locals in the community aided in the rescue of some of the crew, although ten crew members were lost. A bronze medal for gallantry was given by the King to one local for his part.\n\nDuring patrols on the beach and cliffs of Forvie, a dinghy was found and this sparked a search for a spy that had been landed by submarine. This spy was caught in the moray area. It was rumoured that Tillery house near Udny had fascist sympathizers, where spies and airmen were told this was a \"safe house\" during the war. Since there were also Norwegian army personnel in the area who patrolled the beaches, the coast guard and home guard were issued with passes to identify themselves to the Norwegian soldiers.\n\nIn 1948, the Forvie area was earmarked to be a bombing and artillery range for the Royal Air Force and Army, as a site further north than the existing area at Lunan Bay near Arbroath. Forvie was to be used for air to ground and dive bombing practice. This involved a gunnery range out at sea and a rifle range on the moor. This proposal was cancelled in 1950; records exist in the National Archives on the proposal.\n\n==Visitors==\nThe Forvie National Nature Reserve is visited by around 35,000 people each year.<ref name=p27>The Story of Forvie National Nature Reserve. p. 27.</ref> Stevenson Forvie Centre near [[Collieston]] at the northern end of the reserve provides information to visitors.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.nnr-scotland.org.uk/reserve.asp?NNRId=27| title=Forvie Nature Reserve| author=Scottish Natural Heritage| accessdate=2007-05-06}}</ref> The centre first opened in the 1980s, and was substantially upgraded in 1998 with funding from [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]] and a bequest from a local resident, Margaret Stevenson, after whom the centre is now named.<ref name=p27/>\n\nTwo waymarked trails to allow visitors to access the reserve.

The sand at Forvie is formed from the remains of sediment that was transported by rivers to the coast at the end of the last [[Ice Age]]. The sediment settled in the sea, but was gradually washed onshore by the action of waves and wind.<ref name=p9>The Story of Forvie National Nature Reserve. p. 9.</ref>\n\nThe sand dunes at Forvie can be divided into three distinct parts. The southernmost point of the reserve consists of a sand [[Spit (landform)|spit]] at the point where the River Ythan enters the sea. To the north the sand rests on [[raised beach]]es terraces and glaciated rocks. North of this region is an area where the sand lies on top of a rock plateau, with glacial deposits of varying depths sandwiched between the rock and the sand.<ref name=p9/> The dunes are highly mobile, and can reach up to 20&nbsp;m in height. As there is relatively little plant life on these mobile dunes, they have been likened to the [[Sahara Desert]].<ref name=p10>The Story of Forvie National Nature Reserve. p. 10.</ref>\n\n==Flora and fauna==\n[[File:Roosting waders on the Sands of Forvie National Nature Reserve - geograph.org.uk - 618304.jpg|Roosting waders on the Sands of Forvie|thumb]]\nThe reserve contains large areas of sandy foreshore, mobile and fixed [[dune]]s, dune pasture and lowland heath and the successional development of vegetation.

Excavations of the village church, which is dedicated to [[St Adamnan]], shown that it was constructed in the 12th-century, and the dating of burials within the church indicate that it had become a ruin by the 15th-century: local folk history tells of a nine-day storm that led to the village being engulfed by sand in August 1413.<ref name=p19/> The parish of Forvie was annexed by the neighbouring parish of [[Slains]] in 1573.<ref>{{Canmore|num=20839|desc=Forvie Church}}</ref>\n\nIn 1959 the Sands of Forvie was declared a [[national nature reserve (Scotland)|national nature reserve]] (NNR) by agreement between the [[Nature Conservancy Council]] (predecessor body of SNH) and the landowners; the NNR was extended in 1979 to include the [[Ythan Estuary]]. In 2003 SNH bought 65&nbsp;% of the reserve (653&nbsp;ha), and in 2012 SNH bought the remaining land.<ref name=p22>The Story of Forvie National Nature Reserve. p. 22.</ref>\n\n===During the World Wars===\n{{more citations needed|section|date=January 2019}}\nForvie was active in World Wars I and II, although very few details are recorded on the use of the area. It was incorrectly claimed {{by whom|date=January 2019}} there was a nine-hole golf course from 1900 to the outbreak of World War II. The course built for Lady Cathcart in 1900 was on the west coast island Uist.\n\nThe layout of Forvie and Newburgh could be mistaken for the mouth of the River Don in Aberdeen. With this is mind, defences were put in places around the mouth of the Ythan. These consisted of pill boxes, two gun batteries and anti-tank blocks built by the 143rd Pioneer Corps.  From a review of vulnerable beaches from April\u2013October 1941, Forvie appeared on this list and was identified as \"blocked with mines\". The minefield ran from East to West (WO ref 31/521474 to 538472). These were British Type C land mines weighing about 65&nbsp;lbs each. Following a clear up of the area in July 1944, a number of landmines were unaccounted for due to the shifting sands of the area. Mine clearance altered the area slightly as the Bomb Disposal Unit from the Royal Engineers used a converted Bren gun carrier (known as a wasp) as a flamethrower to scorch vegetation on the mined area. Images of the clearance and the location of the minefield is recorded in a local book covering World War 2 in NE Scotland.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.buchanobserver.co.uk/news/buchan-at-war-book-published-1-4730323|title=Buchan at war book published|newspaper=Buchan Observer|date=2018-04-25|accessdate=2019-01-31}}</ref> Records show on some days 222 mines being dealt with, the actual mine count is unknown but the area took several months to clear. on 27 July 1944, Sapper Harry Dean (28) of 11 coy, Royal Engineers was killed whilst clearing a mine at Forvie. Sapper Dean is buried in Yorkshire <ref>http://www.royalengineersbombdisposal-eod.org.uk/dean_h.html</ref>\n\n[[File:Forvie minefield.jpg|thumb|Minefield start / end from Royal Engineers file in TNA - Kew]]\nForvie sands was used to train the Gordon Highlanders and Highland Light Infantry in desert warfare, in addition to this Forvie Moor was used to train soldiers in the use of grenade, anti-tank grenades and 2\" trench mortars.  Since the war, mortar bombs have been found across the moor.  Craters are still visible in the area. The soldiers training at Forvie were billeted at the Slains Lodge and buildings in Collieston.\n\nOn 3 November 1940, 30 High Explosive Bombs were dropped on Forvie Links by the luftwaffe.  This is listed in the Aberdeenshire Civil Defence register, the craters can be seen in 1941 and 1946 aerial photos.\n\nWhilst soldiers were training there, the moor were off limits to locals. However, on Sundays, the locals could use the moor. During this time, locals collected birds eggs to use as food was rationed, and there was a plentiful supply of rabbits.  On Sunday 30 November 1941, three local boys found an unexploded anti-tank grenade in a rabbit burrow that the army had been demonstrating to the home guard.  One of the boys (Alex Ross), then threw it away where it exploded causing him to lose sight in one eye.\n\nOn 31 March 1941, the British steamer ''Melrose Abbey'' ran aground. On 2 April 1941 she was hit by a drifting sea mine blowing a large hole in her side, and settled on the Ythan river bed. During this time, a machine gun was posted at Forvie Sands to offer some protection for the vessel whilst plans were made to move her as she was a target for passing aircraft. The ship was refloated on 26 July 1941 and towed to Aberdeen for repairs. She was later sunk by U-356 on 27 December 1942 north-east of the Azores. Several websites confirm this sinking, but this disagrees with the information in the reference below, which states that \"As for Melrose Abbey, she was released from the Royal Navy in May 1945 and returned to her former owners, the Associated Humber Lines.\"  The second reference may help to resolve this mix-up of ship names.\n\nBeside the pill box of Forvie, two mobile naval 4\" guns were places and controlled by 942nd Defence battery.\n\nOn 26 January 1942, the ''SS Lesrix'', which was carrying machinery, ran aground off Hackley head during a blizzard. Locals in the community aided in the rescue of some of the crew, although ten crew members were lost. A bronze medal for gallantry was given by the King to one local for his part.\n\nDuring patrols on the beach and cliffs of Forvie, a dinghy was found and this sparked a search for a spy that had been landed by submarine. This spy was caught in the moray area. It was rumoured that Tillery house near Udny had fascist sympathizers, where spies and airmen were told this was a \"safe house\" during the war. Since there were also Norwegian army personnel in the area who patrolled the beaches, the coast guard and home guard were issued with passes to identify themselves to the Norwegian soldiers.\n\nIn 1948, the Forvie area was earmarked to be a bombing and artillery range for the Royal Air Force and Army, as a site further north than the existing area at Lunan Bay near Arbroath. Forvie was to be used for air to ground and dive bombing practice. This involved a gunnery range out at sea and a rifle range on the moor. This proposal was cancelled in 1950; records exist in the National Archives on the proposal.\n\n==Visitors==\nThe Forvie National Nature Reserve is visited by around 35,000 people each year.<ref name=p27>The Story of Forvie National Nature Reserve. p. 27.</ref> Stevenson Forvie Centre near [[Collieston]] at the northern end of the reserve provides information to visitors.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.nnr-scotland.org.uk/reserve.asp?NNRId=27| title=Forvie Nature Reserve| author=Scottish Natural Heritage| accessdate=2007-05-06}}</ref> The centre first opened in the 1980s, and was substantially upgraded in 1998 with funding from [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]] and a bequest from a local resident, Margaret Stevenson, after whom the centre is now named.<ref name=p27/>\n\nTwo waymarked trails to allow visitors to access the reserve.

He debuted for them in 1919 and became Kiwi number 125<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Kiwis Roll of Honour\n| publisher = New Zealand Rugby League\n| url =https://nzrl.co.nz/kiwis-home/past-kiwis/\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. He played his club rugby league for the [[Grafton Athletic]] and [[Newton Rangers]] teams in the [[Auckland Rugby League]] competition. He later moved to [[Tauranga]] and played for Tauranga and [[Bay of Plenty Steamers|Bay of Plenty]] at rugby union including against the touring [[Springbok national rugby union team|Springbok]] team in 1921.\n\n==Early Life==\nGeorge Iles grew up in [[Christchurch]]. He was the son of Mrs H. Iles and Albert Iles whose parents had come to New Zealand in one of the first \u201cfour ships\u201d which brought settlers to [[Canterbury, New Zealand|Canterbury]]<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Obituary/Mr Albert Iles\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LV, Issue 9359\n| date = 1926-12-09\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19261209.2.9\n| accessdate = 2020-04-09}}</ref>.\nAlbert was a successful sportsman in his own right captaining the Sydenham Football Club in the 1880s and representing [[Canterbury Rugby Football Union|Canterbury]] and [[Rugby Southland|Southland]] for several years. He was also a champion runner. In 1912 the family moved to [[Auckland]] where they lived until 1919 and it was during these years that George made a name for himself as a rugby league player.\n\n==Rugby League Playing Career==\nGeorge Iles began his playing career for [[Grafton Athletic]] with his name first appearing in a team list for their second grade team in 1914 along with his brother Arthur Iles <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Under League Rules/Fixtures and Teams/Grafton Club\n| page = 10\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LI, Issue 15621\n| date = 1914-05-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19140529.2.132.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. The following season he debuted for the Grafton senior team and played in the [[1915 Auckland Rugby League season|Auckland first grade competition]]. He was fortunate to play alongside the likes of New Zealand rugby league legends [[Karl Ifwersen]] and [[Dougie McGregor]], the later having already played for the [[New Zealand national rugby union team|All Blacks]] rugby team<ref>{{cite news\n| title = The League Game Notes and Comments\n| page = 10\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LII, Issue 15915\n| date = 1915-05-12\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19150512.2.124.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. Grafton were to win the Auckland title [[1915 Auckland Rugby League season|this season]].\n\nBoth George and Arthur were to transfer to the [[Newton Rangers]] team for the [[1916 Auckland Rugby League season|1916 season]]. Newton struggled and finished last however Iles did score 7 out of Newton\u2019s 20 tries making him the second highest try scorer for the entire competition. The following year he went even better scoring 12 tries and leading the try scorer lists in the [[1917 Auckland Rugby League season|1917 competition]].\n\nIn 1918 Iles scored 4 tries for Newton and was also elected secretary of the club at their annual meeting<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Newton Rangers Club\n| page = 7\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LV, Issue 16814\n| date = 1918-04-03\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19180403.2.60\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. He gained his first representative jersey when he was selected for the [[Auckland rugby league team|Auckland]] team for, at that time, a very rare representative fixture. During the war years the [[Auckland Rugby League]] had deliberately played almost no representative matches. The match was against [[Canterbury rugby league team|Canterbury]] and played at the [[Auckland Domain]] in front of 10,000 spectators. Auckland won 45-9 with Iles scoring a try in the corner \u201cafter a cross-field run\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Auckland Defeats Canterbury/Forty-Five Points to Nine\n| page =3\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LV, Issue 16956\n| date = 1918-09-16\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19180916.2.15.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>.\n\nOnce again in [[1919 Auckland Rugby League season|1919]] Iles was a prolific try scorer for Newton notching 10 tries in total including tries in the Roope Rooster semi final against [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]], and the semi final replay against the same opponents when the first match was abandoned near the end after Ponsonby fans encroached on the field and refused to move.

Iles was listed to play in the reserves a week later for the Auckland team to play Australia but he did not take the field in an 8-32 loss.\n\n==Rugby Union Playing Career==\nIn 1920 George Iles moved to Tauranga with his family. There because rugby league was barely played he largely played rugby union over the following decade for Tauranga and the [[Bay of Plenty Steamers|Bay of Plenty]] representative team. In July 1920 he played for Tauranga against Grammar Old Boys. It was said \u201cof the Tauranga team the Isles [sic] brothers, three quarters, played well, and if supported by other members of the back division, would have made things a bit more awkward for the visitors. They both handled the ball well\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Grammar Old Boys v Tauranga\n| page = 8\n| publisher = Observer, Volume XL, Issue 45\n| date = 1920-07-10\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/TO19200710.2.13.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.

Iles helped set up the first try to David Werahiko Borell after he initiated a \u201cnice attack\u201d and he did the same for their second and final try when Montgomery \u201csent the ball across to Iles who opened up splendidly, and the ball came across to Borell, who scored near the corner\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Springboks Beat Bay of Plenty\n| page = 3\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume 49, Issue 7781\n| date = 1921-08-25\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19210825.2.13\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.\n\nDespite these fine rugby achievements it appears that Iles had not forgotten his rugby league background. He was part of an effort to establish rugby league in the Tauranga area in 1922. On April 12 he wrote a letter to the [[Bay of Plenty Times]] about the strength of the rugby league code in various places and was writing in response to a query about why rugby league had been started in the area by Mr. Phelan, a past member of the Tauranga rugby selection committee. Iles responded in a lengthy letter \u201cthe answer is the same as that to why the League game was first commenced \u2013 that is dissatisfaction with Rugby management\u201d, he went on to say \u201ctouching on the standard of play in League, as one who has played both codes I give it as my opinion that League is played on a far higher standard in [[Australia]] and [[Auckland]] than Rugby\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Public Opinion/Rival Codes\n| page = 4\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume L, Issue 7961\n| date = 1922-04-13\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220413.2.27\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. At the end of the season on August 28 he wrote another letter suggesting a match between those players who had been selected for the Tauranga rugby union team and those who had not as there had evidently been some controversy over selections<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Football Challenge\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume L, Issue 8075\n| date = 1922-08-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220829.2.5.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. Then in September he again went on the attack, this time in response to the suggestion by rugby supporters that league players were being paid. He was writing as a member of Tauranga Rugby League and challenged \u201cany member of the Rugby Union to produce evidence of proof of any monetary benefits received by players or officers of the Tauranga Rugby League.

He played his club rugby league for the [[Grafton Athletic]] and [[Newton Rangers]] teams in the [[Auckland Rugby League]] competition. He later moved to [[Tauranga]] and played for Tauranga and [[Bay of Plenty Steamers|Bay of Plenty]] at rugby union including against the touring [[Springbok national rugby union team|Springbok]] team in 1921.\n\n==Early Life==\nGeorge Iles grew up in [[Christchurch]]. He was the son of Mrs H. Iles and Albert Iles whose parents had come to New Zealand in one of the first \u201cfour ships\u201d which brought settlers to [[Canterbury, New Zealand|Canterbury]]<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Obituary/Mr Albert Iles\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LV, Issue 9359\n| date = 1926-12-09\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19261209.2.9\n| accessdate = 2020-04-09}}</ref>.\nAlbert was a successful sportsman in his own right captaining the Sydenham Football Club in the 1880s and representing [[Canterbury Rugby Football Union|Canterbury]] and [[Rugby Southland|Southland]] for several years. He was also a champion runner. In 1912 the family moved to [[Auckland]] where they lived until 1919 and it was during these years that George made a name for himself as a rugby league player.\n\n==Rugby League Playing Career==\nGeorge Iles began his playing career for [[Grafton Athletic]] with his name first appearing in a team list for their second grade team in 1914 along with his brother Arthur Iles <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Under League Rules/Fixtures and Teams/Grafton Club\n| page = 10\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LI, Issue 15621\n| date = 1914-05-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19140529.2.132.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.

Grafton were to win the Auckland title [[1915 Auckland Rugby League season|this season]].\n\nBoth George and Arthur were to transfer to the [[Newton Rangers]] team for the [[1916 Auckland Rugby League season|1916 season]]. Newton struggled and finished last however Iles did score 7 out of Newton\u2019s 20 tries making him the second highest try scorer for the entire competition. The following year he went even better scoring 12 tries and leading the try scorer lists in the [[1917 Auckland Rugby League season|1917 competition]].\n\nIn 1918 Iles scored 4 tries for Newton and was also elected secretary of the club at their annual meeting<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Newton Rangers Club\n| page = 7\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LV, Issue 16814\n| date = 1918-04-03\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19180403.2.60\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. He gained his first representative jersey when he was selected for the [[Auckland rugby league team|Auckland]] team for, at that time, a very rare representative fixture. During the war years the [[Auckland Rugby League]] had deliberately played almost no representative matches. The match was against [[Canterbury rugby league team|Canterbury]] and played at the [[Auckland Domain]] in front of 10,000 spectators.

Iles was listed to play in the reserves a week later for the Auckland team to play Australia but he did not take the field in an 8-32 loss.\n\n==Rugby Union Playing Career==\nIn 1920 George Iles moved to Tauranga with his family. There because rugby league was barely played he largely played rugby union over the following decade for Tauranga and the [[Bay of Plenty Steamers|Bay of Plenty]] representative team. In July 1920 he played for Tauranga against Grammar Old Boys. It was said \u201cof the Tauranga team the Isles [sic] brothers, three quarters, played well, and if supported by other members of the back division, would have made things a bit more awkward for the visitors.

The match was played at [[Rotorua]] with 5,000 spectators present to witness the Springboks win by 17 points to 9. Iles helped set up the first try to Borell after he initiated a \u201cnice attack\u201d and he did the same for their second and final try when Montgomery \u201csent the ball across to Iles who opened up splendidly, and the ball came across to Borell, who scored near the corner\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Springboks Beat Bay of Plenty\n| page = 3\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume 49, Issue 7781\n| date = 1921-08-25\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19210825.2.13\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.\n\nDespite these fine rugby achievements it appears that Iles had not forgotten his rugby league background. He was part of an effort to establish rugby league in the Tauranga area in 1922. On April 12 he wrote a letter to the [[Bay of Plenty Times]] about the strength of the rugby league code in various places and was writing in response to a query about why rugby league had been started in the area by Mr. Phelan, a past member of the Tauranga rugby selection committee. Iles responded in a lengthy letter \u201cthe answer is the same as that to why the League game was first commenced \u2013 that is dissatisfaction with Rugby management\u201d, he went on to say \u201ctouching on the standard of play in League, as one who has played both codes I give it as my opinion that League is played on a far higher standard in [[Australia]] and [[Auckland]] than Rugby\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Public Opinion/Rival Codes\n| page = 4\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume L, Issue 7961\n| date = 1922-04-13\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220413.2.27\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.

Then in September he again went on the attack, this time in response to the suggestion by rugby supporters that league players were being paid. He was writing as a member of Tauranga Rugby League and challenged \u201cany member of the Rugby Union to produce evidence of proof of any monetary benefits received by players or officers of the Tauranga Rugby League.

Powers of local governments in these areas may be exercised by special purpose bodies established outside of the local government legislation, as with Victoria's alpine resorts, or directly by state governments. The area covered by local councils in Australia ranges from as small as {{convert|1.5|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} for the [[Shire of Peppermint Grove]] in metropolitan [[Perth]], to the [[Shire of East Pilbara]] in the [[Pilbara]] region of Western Australia, which covers {{convert|380000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, an area larger than Germany or Japan.\n\n==State/territory controlled==\nLocal government in Australia is subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the states or territories.

A 2002 study identified 55 ROCs with the largest involving 18 councils.<ref name=\"lgr\"/>\n\n==Types of local government==\n[[Image:BerriganShireOffice.JPG|thumb|Offices of the [[Berrigan Shire Council]] in [[Berrigan, New South Wales]]]]\nLocal governments are subdivisions of the states and the [[Northern Territory]]. The Australian Capital Territory has no separate local government, and municipal functions in Canberra and the surrounding part of the ACT normally performed by local government are performed there by the territorial government of the [[Australian Capital Territory]]. However the ACT government has no jurisdiction over, or responsibility for, the Jervis Bay part of the ACT.\n\nAlthough they are all essentially identical in function, Australian local governments have a variety of names. The term \"local government area\" is used to refer collectively to all local governments regardless of designation, whilst the local governing body itself is generally known as a council. Today, the styles \"borough\", \"city\", \"district\", \"municipality\", \"region\", \"shire\", \"town\", \"community government\", \"Aboriginal shire\" and \"Island\" are used in addition to areas/councils without a specific style.\n\nIn general, an urban or suburban LGA is called a ''city'', as in the [[City of Canada Bay]] or [[City of Bunbury]], and is governed by a City Council. A rural LGA covering a larger rural area is usually called a ''shire'', as in [[Shire of Mornington Peninsula]] or [[Lachlan Shire]], and is governed by a Shire Council.\n\nSometimes designations other than \"City\" or \"Shire\" are used in the names of LGAs. The word \"Municipality\" occurs in some states: in New South Wales, it is typically used for older urban areas and the word is also used for several towns in South Australia. Some rural areas in South Australia are known as \"District Councils\", while larger towns and small metropolitan centres in [[Queensland]] and [[Western Australia]] simply use the term \"Town\". New South Wales and Queensland have introduced a new term, \"Region\", for LGAs formed by the amalgamation of smaller shires and rural cities. Historically, the word \"Borough\" was common for small towns and metropolitan areas in Victoria, but only the [[Borough of Queenscliffe]] remains. In New South Wales, where the Local Government Act does not require a designation, some local governments are legally known simply as \"Councils\", such as [[Port Macquarie-Hastings Council]], [[Inner West Council]], or [[Federation Council, New South Wales|Federation Council]]. All the LGAs in Tasmania that were previously 'Municipalities' have been renamed 'Councils.'\n\nAlmost all local councils have the same administrative functions and similar political structures, regardless of their naming, and retain a particular designation (\"Shire\", \"Borough\", \"Town\", \"City\") for historical reasons only. They will typically have an elected council and usually a mayor or shire president responsible for chairing meetings of the council. In some councils, the mayor is a directly elected figure, but in most cases the mayor is elected by their fellow [[councillor]]s from among their own number. The powers of mayors vary as well; for example, mayors in Queensland have broad executive functions, whereas mayors in New South Wales are essentially ceremonial figureheads who can only exercise power at the discretion of the council.\n\nMost of the capital city LGAs administer only the central business districts and nearby central suburbs. A notable exception is the [[City of Brisbane]], the most populous LGA in the country, which administers a significant part of the Brisbane metropolitan area. In most cases, when a city's population statistics are used, it is the [[list of cities in Australia by population|statistical division]] population rather than the local government area.\n\n==Constitutional position of local government==\nLocal government powers are determined by state governments, and states have primary responsibility for funding and exclusive responsibility for supervision of local councils.\n\nLocal government is mentioned in the annotated Australian constitution, as a department of the State Governments, and they are mentioned in the constitutions of each of the six states. A [[Australian referendum, 1988 (Local Government)|1988 referendum]] sought to explicitly insert mention of local government in the federal constitution but this was comprehensively defeated. A further referendum was [[Proposed 2013 Australian constitutional referendum|proposed in 2013]], but was cancelled due to the change in the [[2013 Australian federal election|election date]].\n\nFederal government interaction with local councils happens regularly through the provision of federal grants to help fund local government managed projects.\n\n==Powers and functions==\n[[Image:Caboolture Shire Council.JPG|thumb|Offices of the [[Caboolture Shire Council]] in [[Caboolture, Queensland]]]]\nAll local governments are approximately equal in their theoretical powers, although LGAs that encompass large cities such as [[City of Brisbane|Brisbane]] and [[City of Gold Coast|the Gold Coast]] command more resources due to their larger population base. Unlike local governments in many other countries, services such as police, fire protection and schools are provided by state or territory government rather than by local councils.\n\nThe councils' chief responsibility in the first half of the 20th century was the provision of physical infrastructure such as roads, bridges and sewerage.<ref name=\"lciagw\">{{cite book |title=Local Government in a Global World: Australia and Canada in Comparative Perspective |last=Brunet-Jailly |first=Emmanuel |author2=John Francis Martin |year=2010 |publisher=University of Toronto Press |isbn=0802099637 |pages=82\u201384 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EgrrstseiHAC |accessdate=1 July 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160527184832/https://books.google.com/books?id=EgrrstseiHAC |archive-date=27 May 2016 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> From the 1970s the emphasis changed to community facilities such as libraries and parks, maintenance of local roads, town planning and development approvals, and local services such as waste disposal.  Child care, tourism and urban renewal were also beginning to be part of local governments' role.  These are financed by collection of local land taxes known as \"rates,\" and grants from the state and Commonwealth governments. They are caricatured as being concerned only with the \"three Rs\": Rates, Roads and Rubbish.\n\nHowever, the roles of local government areas in Australia have recently expanded as higher levels of government have devolved activities to the third tier.  Examples include the provision of community health services, regional airports and pollution control<ref name=\"lciagw\"/> as well as community safety and accessible transport.<ref name=\"tplgr\"/> The changes in services has been described as a shift from 'services to property' towards 'services to people'.<ref name=\"tplgr\"/> Community expectations of local government in Australia has risen in the 21st century partly as a result of wider participation in [[decision making]] and [[Corporate transparency|transparent]] management practices.<ref name=\"lciagw\"/>\n\nRecent years have seen some State governments devolving additional powers onto LGAs. In Queensland and Western Australia LGAs have been granted the power to independently enact their own local [[subsidiary legislation]], in contrast to the previous system of [[by-laws]]. Councils also have organised their own representative structures such as Local Government Associations and [[Regional Organisations of Councils]].\n\nDoctrines of [[new public management]] have shaped state government legislation towards increased freedoms aiming to allow greater flexibility on the part of local governments.<ref name=\"tplgr\">{{cite book |title=The Theory and Practice of Local Government Reform |last=Dollery |first=Brian E. |author2=Lorenzo Robotti |year=2008 |publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing |isbn=1781956685 |pages=93\u201396 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pF_ncy3Wyn8C |accessdate=1 July 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160501084016/https://books.google.com/books?id=pF_ncy3Wyn8C |archive-date=1 May 2016 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Unincorporated areas==\nUnlike many other countries, Australia has only one level of local government immediately beneath state and territorial governments. Aside from very sparsely populated areas and a few other special cases, almost all of Australia is part of a local government area. Unincorporated areas are often in remote locations, cover vast areas or have very small populations.\n\n===Australian Capital Territory===\nThe [[Australian Capital Territory]] has no municipalities and is in some sense an unincorporated area. The [[Government of the Australian Capital Territory|ACT government]] is directly responsible for matters normally carried out by a local government. However its powers do not extend to the Jervis Bay component of the ACT. Following the creation of ACT self-government in 1989, this area remains under the direct control of the Commonwealth.\n\nMany Canberra districts have community organisations called \"community councils\", but these are not part of the government (though they generally receive government funding). They do not have the power to change laws or policies, and their role is limited to advising government. They are effectively [[residents' association]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.accesscanberra.act.gov.au/app/answers/detail/a_id/246/~/act-community-councils|title=ACT community councils|website=Access Canberra|accessdate=23 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203013326/https://www.accesscanberra.act.gov.au/app/answers/detail/a_id/246/~/act-community-councils|archive-date=3 February 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===New South Wales===\n[[New South Wales]] has 2 unincorporated areas:\n* [[Unincorporated Far West Region]], covering the western one third of the state (other than the City of Broken Hill).

The Australian Capital Territory has no separate local governments; and functions in Canberra and the surrounding area normally performed by state and local governments are performed there by the territorial government of the [[Australian Capital Territory]].\n\nAlthough they are all essentially identical in function, Australian local governments have a variety of names. The term \"local government area\" is used to refer collectively to all local governments regardless of status, whilst the local governing body itself is generally known as a council. Today, the styles \"borough\", \"city\", \"district\", \"municipality\", \"region\", \"shire\", \"town\", \"community government\", \"Aboriginal shire\" and \"Island\" are used in addition to areas/councils without a specific style.\n\nIn general, an urban or suburban LGA is called a ''city'', as in the [[City of Canada Bay]] or [[City of Bunbury]], and is governed by a City Council. A rural LGA covering a larger rural area is usually called a ''shire'', as in [[Shire of Mornington Peninsula]] or [[Lachlan Shire]], and is governed by a Shire Council.\n\nSometimes words other than \"City\" or \"Shire\" will be used in the names of LGAs. The word \"Municipality\" occurs in some states: in New South Wales, it is typically used for older urban areas and the word is also used for several rural towns in South Australia. Some rural areas in South Australia are known as \"District Councils\", while larger rural towns and small metropolitan centres in [[Queensland]] and [[Western Australia]] simply use the term \"Town\". New South Wales and Queensland have introduced a new term, \"Region\", for LGAs formed by the amalgamation of smaller shires and rural cities. Historically, the word \"Borough\" was common for small towns and metropolitan areas in Victoria, but only the [[Borough of Queenscliffe]] remains. In New South Wales, where the ''Local Government Act'' does not require a designation, some local governments are legally known simply as \"Councils\", such as [[Port Macquarie-Hastings Council]], [[Inner West Council]], or [[Federation Council, New South Wales|Federation Council]]. All the LGAs in Tasmania that were previously 'Municipalities' have been renamed 'Councils.'\n\nAlmost all local councils have the same administrative functions and similar political structures, regardless of their naming, and retain a particular designation (\"Shire\", \"Borough\", \"Town\", \"City\") for historical reasons only. They will typically have an elected council and usually a mayor or shire president responsible for chairing meetings of the council. In some councils, the mayor is a directly elected figure, but in most cases the mayor is elected by their fellow [[councillor]]s from among their own number. The powers of mayors vary as well; for example, mayors in Queensland have broad executive functions, whereas mayors in New South Wales are essentially ceremonial figureheads who can only exercise power at the discretion of the council.\n\nMost of the capital city LGAs administer only the central business districts and nearby central suburbs. A notable exception is the [[City of Brisbane]], the most populous LGA in the country, which administers a significant part of the Brisbane metropolitan area. In most cases, when a city's population statistics are used, it is the [[list of cities in Australia by population|statistical division]] population rather than the local government area.\n\n==Constitutional position of local government==\nLocal government powers are determined by state governments, and states have primary responsibility for funding and exclusive responsibility for supervision of local councils.\n\nLocal government is mentioned in the annotated Australian constitution, as a department of the State Governments, and they are mentioned in the constitutions of each of the six states. A [[Australian referendum, 1988 (Local Government)|1988 referendum]] sought to explicitly insert mention of local government in the federal constitution but this was comprehensively defeated. A further referendum was [[Proposed 2013 Australian constitutional referendum|proposed in 2013]], but was cancelled due to the change in the [[2013 Australian federal election|election date]].\n\nFederal government interaction with local councils happens regularly through the provision of federal grants to help fund local government managed projects.\n\n==Powers and functions==\n[[Image:Caboolture Shire Council.JPG|thumb|Offices of the [[Caboolture Shire Council]] in [[Caboolture, Queensland]]]]\nAll local governments are approximately equal in their theoretical powers, although LGAs that encompass large cities such as [[City of Brisbane|Brisbane]] and [[City of Gold Coast|the Gold Coast]] command more resources due to their larger population base. Unlike local governments in many other countries, services such as police, fire protection and schools are provided by state or territory government rather than by local councils.\n\nThe councils' chief responsibility in the first half of the 20th century was the provision of physical infrastructure such as roads, bridges and sewerage.<ref name=\"lciagw\">{{cite book |title=Local Government in a Global World: Australia and Canada in Comparative Perspective |last=Brunet-Jailly |first=Emmanuel |author2=John Francis Martin |year=2010 |publisher=University of Toronto Press |isbn=0802099637 |pages=82\u201384 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EgrrstseiHAC |accessdate=1 July 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160527184832/https://books.google.com/books?id=EgrrstseiHAC |archive-date=27 May 2016 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> From the 1970s the emphasis changed to community facilities such as libraries and parks, maintenance of local roads, town planning and development approvals, and local services such as waste disposal.  Child care, tourism and urban renewal were also beginning to be part of local governments' role.  These are financed by collection of local land taxes known as \"rates,\" and grants from the state and Commonwealth governments. They are caricatured as being concerned only with the \"three Rs\": Rates, Roads and Rubbish.\n\nHowever, the roles of local government areas in Australia have recently expanded as higher levels of government have devolved activities to the third tier.  Examples include the provision of community health services, regional airports and pollution control<ref name=\"lciagw\"/> as well as community safety and accessible transport.<ref name=\"tplgr\"/> The changes in services has been described as a shift from 'services to property' towards 'services to people'.<ref name=\"tplgr\"/> Community expectations of local government in Australia has risen in the 21st century partly as a result of wider participation in [[decision making]] and [[Corporate transparency|transparent]] management practices.<ref name=\"lciagw\"/>\n\nRecent years have seen some State governments devolving additional powers onto LGAs. In Queensland and Western Australia LGAs have been granted the power to independently enact their own local [[subsidiary legislation]], in contrast to the previous system of [[by-laws]]. Councils also have organised their own representative structures such as Local Government Associations and [[Regional Organisations of Councils]].\n\nDoctrines of [[new public management]] have shaped state government legislation towards increased freedoms aiming to allow greater flexibility on the part of local governments.<ref name=\"tplgr\">{{cite book |title=The Theory and Practice of Local Government Reform |last=Dollery |first=Brian E. |author2=Lorenzo Robotti |year=2008 |publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing |isbn=1781956685 |pages=93\u201396 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pF_ncy3Wyn8C |accessdate=1 July 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160501084016/https://books.google.com/books?id=pF_ncy3Wyn8C |archive-date=1 May 2016 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Unincorporated areas==\nUnlike many other countries, Australia has only one level of local government immediately beneath state and territorial governments. Aside from very sparsely populated areas and a few other special cases, almost all of Australia is part of a local government area. Unincorporated areas are often in remote locations, cover vast areas or have very small populations.\n\n===Australian Capital Territory===\nThe [[Australian Capital Territory]] has no municipalities and is in some sense an unincorporated area. The [[Government of the Australian Capital Territory|ACT government]] is directly responsible for matters normally carried out by a local government.\n\nMany ACT districts have community organisations called \"community councils\", but these are not part of the government (though they generally receive government funding). They do not have the power to change laws or policies, and their role is limited to advising government. They are effectively [[residents' association]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.accesscanberra.act.gov.au/app/answers/detail/a_id/246/~/act-community-councils|title=ACT community councils|website=Access Canberra|accessdate=23 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203013326/https://www.accesscanberra.act.gov.au/app/answers/detail/a_id/246/~/act-community-councils|archive-date=3 February 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===New South Wales===\n[[New South Wales]] has 2 unincorporated areas:\n* [[Unincorporated Far West Region]], located in the far north west of the state is sparsely populated.
