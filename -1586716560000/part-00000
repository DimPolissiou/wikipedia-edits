Despite missing the top 40 of the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], \"Changes\" became one of Bowie's best-known songs. The lyrics are often seen as a manifesto for his chameleonic personality, the frequent change of the world today, and frequent reinventions of his musical style throughout the 1970s. This single has been cited as David Bowie's official US debut, despite the fact that the song \"[[The Man Who Sold the World]]\" was released in the US two years prior. \"Changes\" was the last song Bowie performed live on stage before his retirement from live performances at the end of 2006.<ref name=RS1149>{{Citation | last=Gilmore | first=Mikal | title=How Ziggy Stardust Fell to Earth | journal=[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone magazine]] | issue=1149 | date=2 February 2012 | pages=36\u201343, 68}}</ref>\n\nThe song ranked number 128 on the ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' list of the [[500 Greatest Songs of All Time]]. It is one of four of Bowie's songs to be included in [[The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll]]. It was inducted into the [[Grammy Hall of Fame]] in 2016.\n\nIt charted for the first time on the [[UK Singles Chart]] on 15 January 2016 at number 49 following Bowie's death.\n\n==Composition and recording==\n\"Changes\" was written by Bowie in the summer of 1971 and recorded around the same time at [[Trident Studios]] in London.{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=223\u2013225}}{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=140}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=101}} Co-produced by [[Ken Scott]], he recorded it with pianist [[Rick Wakeman]] and the musicians who would later become known as [[the Spiders from Mars]] \u2013 [[Mick Ronson]], [[Trevor Bolder]] and [[Mick Woodmansey|Woody Woodmansey]].{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=232}}{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|pp=40\u201344}} Wakeman was asked to play during the ''[[Hunky Dory]]'' sessions and accepted. He recalled in 1995 that he met Bowie in late June 1971 at [[Haddon Hall]] in [[Bakewell]], [[Derbyshire]], where Bowie played him demos of \"Changes\" and \"[[Life on Mars?]]\" in \"their raw brilliance\". He recalled: \"He [played] the finest selection of songs I have ever heard in one sitting in my entire life...I couldn't wait to get into the studio and record them.\"{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=223}} This unreleased demo,{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=140}} featuring Bowie solely on piano, exhibits more \"enthusiasm\" than \"accuracy\" from the artist, along with containing \"breathy 'huh's'\" to a slightly different lyric: \"now I place myself to face me...the weeks still seem the same\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=101}} Bowie plays a [[saxophone]] solo on the final recording \u2013 one of his earliest \u2013 which he recollected was recorded \"when I was still going through ideas of using melodic saxophone.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=101}} Bowie has said that the track \"started out as a parody of a [[nightclub]] song, a kind of throwaway\".<ref name=\"Raggett AllMusic\">{{cite web |last1=Raggett |first1=Ned |title=\"Changes\" \u2013 David Bowie |url=https://www.allmusic.com/song/changes-mt0052219284 |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |accessdate=11 April 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190704103816/https://www.allmusic.com/song/changes-mt0052219284 |archive-date=4 July 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"Sound + Vision\">Loder, Kurt Loder; Bowie, David (1989). ''[[Sound + Vision (box set)|Sound + Vision]]'': CD liner notes</ref>\n\nMusically, \"Changes\" is built upon a distinct piano riff, featuring the keys going up in a \"diatonic major descent\".{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=140}} According to biographer [[Peter Doggett]], Bowie didn't know the chord changes on guitar or piano, but \"he followed his fingers as they crept, slowly up and down the keyboard, augmenting familiar shapes or simply reproducing them a step or two along the ivories.\"{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=140}} The piano and bass are similar to album track \"Oh! You Pretty Things\", going up and down a C to D scale. Doggett writes: \"It was as if the piano was scared to rest in one place for more than a couple of beats, in case it would be hemmed in or halted. By restlessly moving, it kept its options open and its spirit alive.\"{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=140}} The song's famous chorus, Bowie stuttering the 'ch' at the beginning of the word 'changes',{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=99}} has been compared to the English rock band [[the Who]],<ref>Blake, Mark (ed.) (2007). \"Future Legend\", ''[[Mojo (magazine)|MOJO]] 60 Years of Bowie'': pp.74\u201375</ref> specifically their 1965 song \"[[My Generation]]\" (\"hope I die before I get old\" reads \"pretty soon now you're gonna get older\").{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=101}} Pegg also believes there's a sense of [[Bob Dylan]]'s \"[[The Times They Are a-Changin' (song)|The Times They Are a-Changin']]\" in the lyrics \"time may change me, but I can't trace time\", in that Bowie is speaking up for his own generation against his elders.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=101}} Bowie had previously spoken about this in an interview with ''The Times'' in 1968: \"We feel our parents' generation has lost control, given up, they\u2019re scared of the future. \"I feel it's basically their fault that things are so bad.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=101}} While biographer Andy Buckley calls album track \"Life on Mars?\" a parody of [[Frank Sinatra]]'s \"[[My Way]]\", he calls \"Changes\" an inversion of it, stating, \"[it's] not a valedictory farewell, but a prophetic hello\" in the line \"turn and face the strange\".{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=99}}\n\n{{Listen\n|filename=David_Bowie_-_Changes.ogg\n|title=David Bowie \"Changes\" (1971)\n|description=21 second sample from David Bowie's \"Changes\".\n|pos=left}}\n\nThe lyrics focus on the compulsive nature of artistic reinvention (\"Strange fascination, fascinating me / Changes are taking the pace I'm going through\") and distancing oneself from the rock mainstream (\"Look out, you rock 'n' rollers\").{{sfn|Buckley|2005|pp=98\u201399}} Buckley writes that 'strange fascination' is a phrase that \"not only embodies a continued quest for the new and the bizarre, but also carries with it the force of compulsion, the notion of having to change to afloat artistically.\"{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=98}} Buckley further analysed the lyrics: \"So I turn myself to face me / But I've never caught a glimpse / Of how the others must see the faker / I'm much too fast to take that test\". He writes that these lines elucidate the three most important components in Bowie's quest for stardom.{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=98}} They highlight the themes of identity, the \"mutability\" of character\" and a \"sense of play\" in both first and third person, signaling the creation of Bowie's future persona Ziggy Stardust. Buckley states: \"Bowie plays up the self-made myth of his butterfly nature, his innate ambivalence, and his endless musical, sexual and political vacillation.\"{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=98}} Throughout the 1970s, Bowie had a \"pathological fear\" of repeating himself, both musically and visually. He gave himself the epithet 'faker' and proclaimed himself as \"pop's fraud; the arch-dissembler.\"{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=98}}\n\nThe song has also been interpreted as touting \"Modern Kids as a New Race\",{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|pp=40\u201344}} a theme echoed on the following album track, \"[[Oh! You Pretty Things]]\". ''[[Rolling Stone]]''<nowiki/>'s contemporary review of ''Hunky Dory'' considered that \"Changes\" could be \"construed as a young man's attempt to reckon how he'll react when it's his time to be on the maligned side of the generation schism\".<ref name=\"Rolling Stone review\">{{cite web |first=John |last=Mendelsohn |title=Hunky Dory |journal=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=6 January 1972 |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/hunky-dory-19720106 |access-date=2 April 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141110180003/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/hunky-dory-19720106 |archive-date=10 November 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Release and reception==\n\"Changes\" was released on 17 December 1971 as the opening track on Bowie's fourth studio album ''[[Hunky Dory]]''.<ref>{{Cite AV media notes|title=Hunky Dory|others=[[David Bowie]]|year=1971|publisher=[[RCA Records]]|location=UK|type=liner notes|id=SF 8244}}</ref> It was subsequently released as the first single of the album (and the label itself{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=100}}) on 7 January 1972 by [[RCA Records]] (as RCA 2160) with fellow album track \"[[Andy Warhol (song)|Andy Warhol]]\" as the B-side.<ref name=\"Single liner notes\" /> This single has been cited as David Bowie's official US debut, despite the fact that the song \"[[The Man Who Sold the World]]\" was released in the US two years prior.<ref name=MEMag>\"Watch that Man\" by Tina Clarke, Music Express magazine, March 1990, page 9</ref> Upon release, like the album, it flopped commercially, peaking at number 66 on the US ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' charts and failing to chart in the UK.{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|pp=40\u201344}} Despite this, it became English disc jockey [[Tony Blackburn]]'s record of the week.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=100}} It wasn't until the success of Bowie's following album ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]'' (1972) that recognition was brought upon ''Hunky Dory'' and \"Changes\", which according to Pegg quickly became a \"turntable favorite\" and \"embedded\" itself into the \"pop-culture psyche\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=100}} Commentators have later argued that \"[[Oh!

[[David Bowie]], originally released on the album ''[[Hunky Dory]]'' in December 1971 and as a single on 7 January 1972, the day before Bowie's 25th birthday. Despite missing the top 40 of the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], \"Changes\" became one of Bowie's best-known songs. The lyrics are often seen as a manifesto for his chameleonic personality, the frequent change of the world today, and frequent reinventions of his musical style throughout the 1970s. This single has been cited as David Bowie's official US debut, despite the fact that the song \"[[The Man Who Sold the World]]\" was released in the US two years prior. \"Changes\" was the last song Bowie performed live on stage before his retirement from live performances at the end of 2006.<ref name=RS1149>{{Citation | last=Gilmore | first=Mikal | title=How Ziggy Stardust Fell to Earth | journal=[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone magazine]] | issue=1149 | date=2 February 2012 | pages=36\u201343, 68}}</ref>\n\nThe song ranked number 128 on the ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' list of the [[500 Greatest Songs of All Time]]. It is one of four of Bowie's songs to be included in [[The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll]]. It was inducted into the [[Grammy Hall of Fame]] in 2016.\n\nIt charted for the first time on the [[UK Singles Chart]] on 15 January 2016 at number 49 following Bowie's death.\n\n==Composition and recording==\n\"Changes\" was written by Bowie in the summer of 1971 and recorded around the same time at [[Trident Studios]] in London.{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=223\u2013225}}{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=140}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=101}} Co-produced by [[Ken Scott]], he recorded it with pianist [[Rick Wakeman]] and the musicians who would later become known as [[the Spiders from Mars]] \u2013 [[Mick Ronson]], [[Trevor Bolder]] and [[Mick Woodmansey|Woody Woodmansey]].{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=232}}{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|pp=40\u201344}} Wakeman was asked to play during the ''[[Hunky Dory]]'' sessions and accepted. He recalled in 1995 that he met Bowie in late June 1971 at [[Haddon Hall]] in [[Bakewell]], [[Derbyshire]], where Bowie played him demos of \"Changes\" and \"[[Life on Mars?]]\" in \"their raw brilliance\". He recalled: \"He [played] the finest selection of songs I have ever heard in one sitting in my entire life...I couldn't wait to get into the studio and record them.\"{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=223}} This unreleased demo,{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=140}} featuring Bowie solely on piano, exhibits more \"enthusiasm\" than \"accuracy\" from the artist, along with containing \"breathy 'huh's'\" to a slightly different lyric: \"now I place myself to face me...the weeks still seem the same\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=101}} Bowie plays a [[saxophone]] solo on the final recording \u2013 one of his earliest \u2013 which he recollected was recorded \"when I was still going through ideas of using melodic saxophone.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=101}} Bowie has said that the track \"started out as a parody of a [[nightclub]] song, a kind of throwaway\".<ref name=\"Raggett AllMusic\">{{cite web |last1=Raggett |first1=Ned |title=\"Changes\" \u2013 David Bowie |url=https://www.allmusic.com/song/changes-mt0052219284 |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |accessdate=11 April 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190704103816/https://www.allmusic.com/song/changes-mt0052219284 |archive-date=4 July 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"Sound + Vision\">Loder, Kurt Loder; Bowie, David (1989). ''[[Sound + Vision (box set)|Sound + Vision]]'': CD liner notes</ref>\n\nMusically, \"Changes\" is built upon a distinct piano riff, featuring the keys going up in a \"diatonic major descent\".{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=140}} According to biographer [[Peter Doggett]], Bowie didn't know the chord changes on guitar or piano, but \"he followed his fingers as they crept, slowly up and down the keyboard, augmenting familiar shapes or simply reproducing them a step or two along the ivories.\"{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=140}} The piano and bass are similar to album track \"Oh! You Pretty Things\", going up and down a C to D scale. Doggett writes: \"It was as if the piano was scared to rest in one place for more than a couple of beats, in case it would be hemmed in or halted. By restlessly moving, it kept its options open and its spirit alive.\"{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=140}} The song's famous chorus, Bowie stuttering the 'ch' at the beginning of the word 'changes',{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=99}} has been compared to the English rock band [[the Who]],<ref>Blake, Mark (ed.) (2007). \"Future Legend\", ''[[Mojo (magazine)|MOJO]] 60 Years of Bowie'': pp.74\u201375</ref> specifically their 1965 song \"[[My Generation]]\" (\"hope I die before I get old\" reads \"pretty soon now you're gonna get older\").{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=101}} Pegg also believes there's a sense of [[Bob Dylan]]'s \"[[The Times They Are a-Changin' (song)|The Times They Are a-Changin']]\" in the lyrics \"time may change me, but I can't trace time\", in that Bowie is speaking up for his own generation against his elders.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=101}} Bowie had previously spoken about this in an interview with ''The Times'' in 1968: \"We feel our parents' generation has lost control, given up, they\u2019re scared of the future. \"I feel it's basically their fault that things are so bad.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=101}} While biographer Andy Buckley calls album track \"Life on Mars?\" a parody of [[Frank Sinatra]]'s \"[[My Way]]\", he calls \"Changes\" an inversion of it, stating, \"[it's] not a valedictory farewell, but a prophetic hello\" in the line \"turn and face the strange\".{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=99}}\n\n{{Listen\n|filename=David_Bowie_-_Changes.ogg\n|title=David Bowie \"Changes\" (1971)\n|description=21 second sample from David Bowie's \"Changes\".\n|pos=left}}\n\nThe lyrics focus on the compulsive nature of artistic reinvention (\"Strange fascination, fascinating me / Changes are taking the pace I'm going through\") and distancing oneself from the rock mainstream (\"Look out, you rock 'n' rollers\").{{sfn|Buckley|2005|pp=98\u201399}} Buckley writes that 'strange fascination' is a phrase that \"not only embodies a continued quest for the new and the bizarre, but also carries with it the force of compulsion, the notion of having to change to afloat artistically.\"{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=98}} Buckley further analysed the lyrics: \"So I turn myself to face me / But I've never caught a glimpse / Of how the others must see the faker / I'm much too fast to take that test\". He writes that these lines elucidate the three most important components in Bowie's quest for stardom.{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=98}} They highlight the themes of identity, the \"mutability\" of character\" and a \"sense of play\" in both first and third person, signaling the creation of Bowie's future persona Ziggy Stardust. Buckley states: \"Bowie plays up the self-made myth of his butterfly nature, his innate ambivalence, and his endless musical, sexual and political vacillation.\"{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=98}} Throughout the 1970s, Bowie had a \"pathological fear\" of repeating himself, both musically and visually.

The [[phosphate]] from [[Dorowa]] (to the south-west) are handled by the railways here.\n\n==History==\nInyazura was in the time of steam traction a so-called booking-off depot. Salisbury (now Harare) based traincrews would book off at Inyazura (better known by traincrews as IY) and Inyazura based traincrews would then work the Umtali/Beira trains onwards to Umtali (now Mutare).\n\nAfter the laid down booking off period (usually 12 hours) the rested Salisbury crews would then take the Saisbury bound trains back to their home depot.\n\nWhen diesel traction was introduced on the Salisbury-Umtali section (early 1950s) the booking off system was phased out, Inyazura was closed as a re-crewing depot, and the so-called round trip working was introduced whereby Salisbury  train crews met up with the Umtali train crews at a booked change over place (usually Eagles Nest siding) where the crews handed over trains and locomotives to each other and then returned to their own home depots.\n\n==Economy==\nIn addition to being a booking off station for the railways, Nyazure developed into a service center for the commercial farming enterprises that were developed around it in the 1950s. The old \"Farmers Co-op\" store (referred to as \"Big Store\") was constructed in this period and continued to serve as the farmers' supply center well into the 1980s. Over the same period, Nyazure became the administrative center for Tsungwesi Rural Council which served the then Commercial farming sector. From the 1950s to the 1960s Nyazure was the base for the Margolis family's trading enterprise which extended over most of Chiduku and Buhera Tribal Trust Lands (Communal Lands) where they purchased grain and groundnuts from the small scale growers. Most of the buildings in the settlement were developed during this period. The development of the Harare-Mutare By-pass to the east of the settlement in the 1960s appeared to have taken the \"wind out of the settlement's life\" as road traffic which used to pass through it was diverted away. Most of the services that were previously provided from the settlement could also be provided from Rusape.\n\nNew life has been injected into Nyazure over the past twenty years with the designation of agro-residential plots and a new residential suburb to the south of the settlement. A Central Business District (CBD) has also been designated between the old settlement and the main Harare-Mutare road. A number of private entrepreneurs have already started developing various business outlets in the area. The settlement also serves a much larger farming population following the land redistribution programme which has seen all the commercial farming properties around it sub-dived to accommodate previously landless locals.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Coord|18|43|S|32|10|E|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Populated places in Zimbabwe]]\n[[Category:Populated places in Manicaland Province]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2019}}\n{{Unreferenced|date=December 2009}}\n'''Nyazura''' (formerly Inyazura) (the locals call it Nyazure) is the second largest urban settlement in Makoni District in the province of [[Manicaland]], [[Zimbabwe]] located 72&nbsp;km north-west of [[Mutare]] on the main road and [[railway]] linking [[Harare]] and Mutare.

Muffin, calling himself Napoleon and pretending to be tough, wishes that he could live with the wild dogs that he can hear howling in the distance. The family has a birthday party and one of the decorations is a basket with balloons strapped to it. Out of curiosity, Napoleon hops inside, but the basket, untied from its tether, begins to float away.\n\nNapoleon flies high above the city and heads out to the sea. A [[galah]] named Birdo drops down on the side of his basket and offers to help him get down. Birdo's idea of help is to pop the balloons suspending the basket, causing Napoleon to land unharmed on a beachhead. Napoleon thinks he can finally seek out the wild dogs and heads into a nearby forest, ignoring Birdo's suggestion to return home.\n\nAt night, Napoleon starts to fear being alone. A [[tawny frogmouth|mopoke]] in the forest warns Napoleon of terrible things that can happen to pets in the wild, but Napoleon ignores him as well and continues on his way. He discovers a large tree used by a psychotic cat as a home. The cat spots Napoleon and, thinking he is a mouse, chases him. Napoleon escapes when the mopoke pushes the cat into a pond. The mopoke then warns Napoleon that the cat will not rest until he is dead. As Napoleon runs off, the cat pulls herself from the pond angrily swearing revenge.\n\nThe next morning, Napoleon once again encounters Birdo, who decides to teach Napoleon how to live in the wild.\n\nNapoleon learns about hunting by practising on a group of rabbits, but fails to catch one and ends up  eating moss instead. Birdo's next lessons about friendly and dangerous animals and snowy weather are ignored. A sudden brush fire burns a [[sugarcane]] field, but Napoleon escapes with Birdo's help. The cat returns and attempts to attack Birdo, but fails. Birdo reunites with his lost flock but the cat has found them too; Napoleon saves them with a warning of the cat. Napoleon and Birdo then part ways as Napoleon wants to seek the wild dogs and Birdo wants to rejoin his flock.\n\nNapoleon is saddened when he realises that the howling he has been hearing was just a [[perentie]] lizard. As the area begins to flood, he runs for shelter and discovers two [[dingo]] puppies inside a damp cave and assumes they are lost like him. The water floods in and sweeps away Nancy, one of the pups. Napoleon dives into the water and rescues her. The pups' mother returns and Napoleon realises that he has found the wild dogs.\n\nThe mother agrees to let Napoleon live with her and her pups. While out together, the mother asks why Napoleon wanted to be with the wild dogs. He explains that he always wanted to feel brave by living in the wild, but confesses to being disappointed with the lifestyle. The mother comforts him by reminding him it was his courage that led him out here and helped him save her puppies, which represents the true spirit of the wild dogs. Wanting to go home, Napoleon takes a trip across the landscape in a kangaroo's pouch. Napoleon reaches the shore and discovers that his basket is inhabited by a feisty penguin who resembles his past self, wanting to be a wild and brave creature. That night, Napoleon's plan to sail back to the city with the basket is interrupted by the cat's return. A battle ensues and Napoleon tries multiple times to stop the cat. Before she can kill Napoleon, the cat becomes distracted by the penguin, who taunts her. Napoleon then knocks the cat off the cliff and into the basket, which sails away in the water. On a cliff side, Napoleon sees an image of a wild dog howling, symbolising that he understands his bravery of being a wild dog inside.\n\nBirdo reappears with a sea turtle who takes Napoleon back to the city. Napoleon returns home to his mother, who consents to calling him Napoleon instead of Muffin.\n\n==Voice cast==\n* [[Jamie Croft]] as Napoleon, a [[Golden Retriever]] pup.\n[[Adam Wylie]] voices Napoleon in the US version.\n* [[Philip Quast]] as Birdo, a galah.\n[[Bronson Pinchot]] voices Birdo in the US version.\n* [[Susan Lyons]] as Napoleon's mom, and a Wallaby\n[[Wendy Makkena]] voices Napoleon's mom and a Wallaby in the US version\n* Coralie Sawade as Kids' Mother\n* Brenton Whittle as the Owl, the Frog, the Wombat, a Wallaby, a Desert Mouse\n* [[Anne-Louise Lambert|Anne Lambert]] as the [[Delena cancerides|Spider]], the Earless Wallaby, a Desert Mouse\n* [[Carole Skinner]] as the Cat\n* Lucia Mastrantone as the Lone Lorikeet\n* [[Frank Whitten]] as the Koala\n* Fiona Press as a Wallaby, a Galah, Mother Dingo\n* [[Steven Vidler (actor)|Steven VIdler]] as the Snake, a Galah, a Desert Mouse, and the Sea Turtle\n* [[David Argue]] as a Galah, the Frill Necked Lizard\n* Edward McQueen-Mason as a Galah, and the Echidna\n* [[Stuart Pankin]] as the Perenti Lizard, and Father Penguin\n* Mignon Kent as Nancy, a Dingo pup\n* Michael Wilkop as Sid, a Dingo pup\n* [[Barry Humphries]] ([[Dame Edna Everage]]) as the Kangaroo\n* [[Casey Siemaszko]] as Conan, a Penguin\n* [[Joan Rivers]] as Mother Penguin\n\nVoices for the lorikeets and rabbits include Catherine Lambert, Tracey Canini, Annabel Sims, Neusa Timms, and Debbie Horn.

Given that this state is the most positive state for a human to be in, it is often simplified to mean happiness.

For Aristotle, achieving virtue involves asking the question \"how should I ''be''\u201d rather than \"what should I ''do''.\u201d A fully virtuous person is described as achieving eudaimonia, and therefore would be undeniably happy.

He is best known for his political philosophy, but he proposed two thought experiments directly tied to issues on Philosophy of Happiness.\n\nIn his 1974 book, ''[[Anarchy, State, Utopia]]'', he proposed a [[thought experiment]] where one is given the option to enter a machine that would give the maximum amount of unending hedonistic pleasure for the entirety of one's life. The machine described in his thought experiment is often described as the \"[[Experience machine|Experience Machine]].\" The machine works by giving the participant connected to it the sensation of any experience they desired and is said to produce sensations that are indistinguishable from real life experiences.<ref>Crisp, Roger. \"Hedonism Reconsidered\".

Accessed 18 February 2020.</ref>\n\nNozick outlined the \u201c[[utility monster]]\u201d thought experiment as an attempted criticism to utilitarianism. Utilitarian ethics provides guidance for acting morally, but also to maximizing happiness. The utility monster is a hypothetical being that generates extreme amount of theoretical pleasure units compared to the average person. Consider a situation such as the utility monster receiving fifty units of pleasure from eating a cake versus forty other people receiving only one unit of pleasure per cake eaten. Although each individual receives the same treatment or good, the utility monster somehow generates more than all the other people combined. Given many utilitarian commitments to maximizing utility related to pleasure, the thought experiment is meant to force utilitarians to commit themselves to feeding the utility monster instead of a mass of other people, despite our general intuitions insisting otherwise. The criticism essentially comes in the form of a [[reductio ad absurdum]] criticism by showing that utilitarians adopt a view that is absurd to our moral intuitions, specifically that we should consider the utility monster with much more regard than a number of other people.<ref>Sridharan, Vishnu. \"Utility Monsters and the Distribution of Dharmas: A Reply to Charles Goodman\".

For Aristotle, achieving virtue involves asking the question \"how should I ''be''\u201d rather than \"what should I ''do''.\u201d A fully virtuous person is described as achieving eudaimonia, and therefore would be undeniably happy.

He is best known for his political philosophy, but he proposed two thought experiments directly tied to issues on Philosophy of Happiness.\n\nIn his 1974 book, ''[[Anarchy, State, Utopia]]'', he proposed a [[thought experiment]] where one is given the option to enter a machine that would give the maximum amount of unending hedonistic pleasure for the entirety of one's life. The machine described in his thought experiment is often described as the \"[[Experience machine|Experience Machine]].\" The machine works by giving the participant connected to it the sensation of any experience they desired and is said to produce sensations that are indistinguishable from real life experiences.<ref>Crisp, Roger. \"Hedonism Reconsidered\".

Accessed 18 February 2020.</ref>\n\nNozick outlined the \u201c[[utility monster]]\u201d thought experiment as an attempted criticism to utilitarianism. Utilitarian ethics provides guidance for acting morally, but also to maximizing happiness. The utility monster is a hypothetical being that generates extreme amount of theoretical pleasure units compared to the average person. Consider a situation such as the utility monster receiving fifty units of pleasure from eating a cake versus forty other people receiving only one unit of pleasure per cake eaten. Although each individual receives the same treatment or good, the utility monster somehow generates more than all the other people combined. Given many utilitarian commitments to maximizing utility related to pleasure, the thought experiment is meant to force utilitarians to commit themselves to feeding the utility monster instead of a mass of other people, despite our general intuitions insisting otherwise. The criticism essentially comes in the form of a [[reductio ad absurdum]] criticism by showing that utilitarians adopt a view that is absurd to our moral intuitions, specifically that we should consider the utility monster with much more regard than a number of other people.<ref>Sridharan, Vishnu. \"Utility Monsters and the Distribution of Dharmas: A Reply to Charles Goodman\".

Up to 1969, Ingenheim had been an autonomous borough.\n\n== Geography ==\nThe village lies in the Southern Palatinate, part of it belongs to the nature preserve \"Klingbachtal-Kaiserbachtal\". North of the village centre runs the [[Klingbach]]. The region belongs to the [[Upper Rhine Plain|Northern Rhine Rift Valley]]. Ingenheim lies southwest of the district of Billigheim and south of the district of Appenhofen. Federal road no. 38 connects the village to the central towns of [[Landau | Landau in der Pfalz]] and [[Bad Bergzabern]].\n\nVarious dwelling places, like Dorfm\u00fchle, Friedrichshof, Im alten Grund, Im Peterswingert, Kehlerhof, Luisenhof and St. Georgenhof, are part of Ingenheim as well.\n\n== History ==\nVillage names with the ending \u201c-heim\u201c in the Upper Rhine area are attributed to the time of [[Frankish colonisation]] (5th to 7th century). Ingenheim presumably derives from the personal name Ingo. Therefore, Ingenheim was settled by a person named Ingo.\n\nThe first documented mentions of the village name dates back to 1236 and 1238, when two [[Burgmann]]en of [[Landeck Castle (Palatinate)|Landeck Castle]], a Konrad of Ingenheim and a Heinrich von Ingenheim, acted as witnesses to a gift of goods from the town of [Klingenm\u00fcnster | [M\u00fcnster]] to the [[Klingenm\u00fcnster Abbey]]. The knights of Ingenheim appear quite frequently in documents of this time up to the middle of the 15th century.\n\nThe village Ingenheim was originally a [[fief]] belonging to the Klingenm\u00fcnster Abbey. As such, as a property of Castle Meistersel, half of the village was pawned by Otto von [[Ch\u00e2teau d'Ochsenstein|Ochsenstein]] in 1369 to Konrad Landschad von Steinach. In 1395 Friedrich von Ochsenstein sold the other half to the [[Bishopric of Speyer]]. In the 16th century the village became the property of the barons of Gemmingen and remained in their possession up to the end of the 18th century.\n\nIn 1792, after the [[French Revolution]] (1789), the region became part of [[France]]. Under French administration, Ingenheim belonged from 1794 onwards to the Canton of Landau, which was assigned to the [[Arrondissement of Wissembourg]] in the [[Bas-Rhin]] department (department of the Lower Rhine). In 1804, 798 inhabitants boasted the village.\n\nWhile the Canton of Landau, and therefore Ingenheim as well, was assigned to France during the first [[Treaty of Paris (1814)]], this part of the department of the Lower Rhine located north of the river [[Lauter (Rhine)|Lauter]] came under the sovereign territory of [Austrian Empire | [Austria]] with the second [[Treaty of Paris (1815)]]. The remaining areas of the Palatinate region, formerly belonging to the department of the [[Mont-Tonnerre]], were given to Austria at the [[Congress of Vienna]] in June 1815. With the [[Treaty of Munich (1816)|Treaty of Munich]] in April 1816, the entire [[Palatinate (region)|Palatinate region]] was reassigned from the Austrian Empire to the [[Kingdom of Bavaria]].\n\nUnder Bavarian administration, Ingenheim first remained in the Bavarian Canton of Landau. Due to territorial adjustments in 1817, Ingenheim was reclassified together with 5 additional municipalities to the Canton of Bergzabern, which was assigned to the County Commissariat Bergzabern (from 1862 known as District Administrative of Bergzabern). The municipality of Ingenheim had an autonomous administration. In 1819 and 1925, Daniel Bourquin was mayor of Ingenheim.\n\nDuring the 19th century, Ingenheim was the largest [[Qahal|Jewish community]] in the Palatinate. In the 1830s, a total of 1,631 inhabitants were living in Ingenheim, of which 551 were [[Jews|Jewish]]. The synagogue, which was destroyed in 1938, was built in 1831/1832. From 1869 to 1884, Ingenheim even had a Jewish mayor with Bernhard Roos (1796-1888).\n\nAccording to 1928 official index of towns for the free state of [[Bavaria]], a total of 1,315 inhabitants lived in 277 residential buildings in the rural community of Ingenheim.\n\n531 inhabitants were Catholics, 687 were Protestants, 96 were Jews, and one was designated as \"other\u201c. The municipality covered 554 hectares. There was a Catholic and a Protestant parish, a Catholic, a Protestant, and a Jewish school as well as a post office. The train station \u201cIngenheim-Appenhofen\u201c, on the route of the \u201cKlingbachtalbahn\u201c, was located in Ingenheim. The village mill with its six inhabitants belonged to the municipality as well.\n\nIn the course of the first territorial and administrative reform in Rhineland-Palatinate, the formerly autonomous municipality of Ingenheim, with at that time 1,436 inhabitants, was dissolved on June 7, 1969. Together with the municipalities of Appenhofen, Billigheim and M\u00fchlhofen, the new municipality of [[Billigheim-Ingenheim]] was formed. At the same time, the district Bergzabern was dissolved and the municipality of Billigheim-Ingenheim was assigned to the new district Landau-Bad Bergzabern (renamed to [[S\u00fcdliche Weinstra\u00dfe]] in 1977).\n\n== Transport ==\nBetween 1892 and 1967, Ingenheim was connected to the railway network by the \u201cKlingbachtalbahn\u201c. The corresponding train station \u201cIngenheim-Appenhofen\u201c was located in Ingenheim. The nearest train station since then is Rohrbach.\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.billigheim-ingenheim.de/index.php?id=81 Ortsteile von Billigheim-Ingenheim auf der Homepage der Ortsgemeinde]\n* [http://www.swr.de/landesschau-rp/hierzuland/-/id=100766/nid=100766/did=6686968/z8srtl/ Ortsportr\u00e4t von Ingenheim mit einem Filmbeitrag von Hierzuland, SWR Fernsehen]\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n<!-- <ref name=\"PR\">\n{{Literatur\n| Titel=Handbuch des Rheinischen Particular-Rechts: Entwickelung der Territorial- und Verfassungsverh\u00e4ltnisse der deutschen Staaten an beiden Ufern des Rheins : vom ersten Beginnen der franz\u00f6sischen Revolution bis in die neueste Zeit\n| Autor=Wilhelm von der Nahmer\n| Band=3\n| Seiten=393\n| Verlag=Sauerl\u00e4nder\n| Ort=Frankfurt am Main\n| Datum=1832\n| Online= {{Google Buch|Linktext=online bei Google Books|KeinText=1|BuchID=btNDAAAAcAAJ|Seite=393}}\n}}\n</ref>\n -->\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Municipalities in Rhineland-Palatinate]]\n[[Category:S\u00fcdliche Weinstra\u00dfe]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox Ortsteil einer Gemeinde in Deutschland\n| Name              = Ingenheim\n| Art           = Ortsteil\n| Municipality          = [[Billigheim-Ingenheim]]\n| Ortswappen            = Wappen Ingenheim.png\n| Ortswappen-Beschreibung = Wappen der ehemaligen Gemeinde Ingenheim\n| Bundesland            = Rheinland-Pfalz\n| coordinates       = {{coord|49.136|8.100|format=dms|display=inline,title}}\n| H\u00f6he                  = 150\n| H\u00f6he-Bezug            = DE-NHN\n| Fl\u00e4che                = \n| Fl\u00e4che-Quelle          = \n| Einwohner             = 1455\n| Stand = 1999-12-31<ref>[http://www.klingbachtal.de/bi_homepage/bi_ortsportrait/bi_einwohnerstatistik.html Einwohnerstatistik Billigheim-Ingenheim bei www.klingbachtal.de]</ref>\n| Eingemeindungsdatum   = 1969-06-07\n| PLZ         = 76831\n| Vorwahl              = 06349\n| Poskarte              = Deutschland Rheinland-Pfalz\n| Bild                  = \n| Bild-Beschreibung     = \n}}\n\n[[File:Ingenheim Katholische Kirche 20140306.jpg|thumbnail|upright|Catholic Church St. Bartholomew]]\n[[File:Ingenheim evangelische Kirche 20140306.jpg|thumbnail|upright|Evangelical Church]]\n\n'''Ingenheim''' is a village belonging to the municipality of [[Billigheim-Ingenheim]] in the district [[S\u00fcdliche Weinstra\u00dfe]] (Southern Wine Route) in the [[Rhineland-Palatinate]], [[Germany]]. Up to 1969, Ingenheim had been an autonomous borough.\n\n== Geography ==\nThe village lies in the Southern Palatinate, part of it belongs to the nature preserve \"Klingbachtal-Kaiserbachtal\". North of the village centre runs the [[Klingbach]]. The region belongs to the [[Upper Rhine Plain|Northern Rhine Rift Valley]]. Ingenheim lies southwest of the district of Billigheim and south of the district of Appenhofen. Federal road no. 38 connects the village to the central towns of [[Landau | Landau in der Pfalz]] and [[Bad Bergzabern]].\n\nVarious dwelling places, like Dorfm\u00fchle, Friedrichshof, Im alten Grund, Im Peterswingert, Kehlerhof, Luisenhof and St. Georgenhof, are part of Ingenheim as well.\n\n== History ==\nVillage names with the ending \u201c-heim\u201c in the Upper Rhine area are attributed to the time of [[Frankish colonisation]] (5th to 7th century). Ingenheim presumably derives from the personal name Ingo. Therefore, Ingenheim was settled by a person named Ingo.\n\nThe first documented mentions of the village name dates back to 1236 and 1238, when two [[Burgmann]]en of [[Landeck Castle (Palatinate)|Landeck Castle]], a Konrad of Ingenheim and a Heinrich von Ingenheim, acted as witnesses to a gift of goods from the town of [Klingenm\u00fcnster | [M\u00fcnster]] to the [[Klingenm\u00fcnster Abbey]].
