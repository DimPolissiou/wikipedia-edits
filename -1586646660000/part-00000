Born into a prominent [[Boston]] [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] family, he accepted command of the first all-[[African Americans|black]] regiment (the [[54th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment|54th Massachusetts]]) in the Northeast. Supporting the promised equal treatment for his troops, he encouraged the men to refuse their pay until it was equal to that of [[White Americans|white]] troops' wage. \n\nHe led his regiment at the [[Second Battle of Fort Wagner]] in July 1863. They attacked a beachhead near [[Charleston, South Carolina]], and Shaw was killed while leading his men to the parapet of the Confederate-held fort. Although the regiment was overwhelmed by firing from the defenses and driven back, suffering many casualties, Shaw's leadership and the regiment became legendary. They inspired hundreds of thousands more African Americans to enlist for the Union helping to turn the tide of the war to its ultimate victory.\n\n==Early life and education==\nShaw was born in Boston to [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionists]] Francis George and [[Sarah Blake Sturgis Shaw|Sarah Blake (Sturgis) Shaw]], who were well-known [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] philanthropists and intellectuals of [[Scottish people|Scottish]] descent. The Shaws had the benefit of a large inheritance left by Shaw's merchant grandfather and namesake Robert Gould Shaw (1775\u20131853).<ref name=BCC1897>{{cite book |author=Boston City Council |title=Exercises at the dedication of the monument to Colonel Robert Gould Shaw and the Fifty-fourth regiment of the Massachusetts infantry (May 31, 1897) |publisher=Municipal Printing Office |location=Boston |year=1897 |url=https://archive.org/stream/exercisesatdedic00bosto#page/n7/mode/2up}}</ref> Shaw had four sisters\u2014Anna, [[Josephine Shaw Lowell|Josephine]] (Effie), Susanna, and Ellen (Nellie).<ref>{{cite web|title=Caroline Wells Healey Dall journal, 1862-1865, pages with entries for 6-8 August 1863|url=https://www.masshist.org/online/civilwar/index.php?entry_id=934|website=Massachusetts Historical Society|publisher=Massachusetts Historical Society|access-date=16 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nWhen Shaw was five years old, the family moved to a large estate in [[West Roxbury]], adjacent to [[Brook Farm]]. During his teens he traveled and studied for some years in Europe. In 1847, the family moved to [[Staten Island]], New York, settling among a community of [[Intellectual|literati]] and abolitionists while Shaw attended the [[Fordham Preparatory School|Second Division of St. John's College]], a preparatory school, at [[Fordham University|Fordham]]. These studies were at the behest of his uncle Joseph Coolidge Shaw, who had been ordained as a Roman Catholic priest in 1847. He converted to [[Catholicism]] during a trip to Rome, in which he befriended several members of the [[Oxford Movement]], which had begun in the Anglican Church. Robert began his high school-level education at St. John's in 1850, the same year that Joseph Shaw began studying there for entrance into the [[Jesuits]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.fordhamprep.org/page.cfm?p=4856|title=Fordham Preparatory School: Col Robert Gould Shaw|website=www.fordhamprep.org|access-date=2017-05-09}}</ref>\n\nIn 1851, while Shaw was still at St. John's, his uncle died from [[tuberculosis]]. Aged 13,  Shaw had a difficult time adjusting to his surroundings and wrote several despondent letters home to his mother. In one of his letters, he claimed to be so homesick that he often cried in front of his classmates.<ref name=\":0\" /> While at St. John's, he studied Latin, Greek, French, and Spanish, and practiced playing the violin, which he had begun as a young boy. \n\nHe left St. John's in late 1851 before graduation, as the Shaw family departed for an extended tour of Europe. Shaw entered a boarding school in [[Neuch\u00e2tel]], [[Switzerland]] where he stayed for two years. Afterward, his father transferred him to a school with a less strict system of discipline in [[Hanover]], [[Germany]], hoping that it would better suit his restless temperament.<ref name=\":0\" /> While in Hanover, Shaw enjoyed the greater degree of personal freedom at his new school, on one occasion writing home to his mother, \"It's almost impossible not to drink a good deal, because there is so much good wine here.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nWhile Shaw was studying in Europe, [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]], an abolitionist friend of his parents, published her novel ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'' (1852). Shaw read the book multiple times and was moved by its plot and anti-slavery attitude. Around the same time, Shaw wrote that his patriotism had been bolstered after encountering several instances of anti-Americanism among some Europeans. He expressed interest to his parents in attending [[West Point]] or joining the [[US Navy|Navy]]. Because Shaw had had a longstanding difficulty with taking orders and obeying authority figures, his parents did not view this ambition seriously.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nShaw returned to the United States in 1856. From 1856 until 1859 he attended [[Harvard University]], joining the [[Porcellian Club]],<ref>{{cite book|title=Catalogue of the Porcellian Club of Harvard University|date=1877|publisher=Harvard university.

He had been a member of the class of 1860. Shaw found Harvard no easier to adjust to than any of his previous schools and wrote to his parents about his discontent.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAfter leaving Harvard in 1859, Shaw returned to Staten Island to work with one of his uncles at the mercantile firm Henry P. Sturgis and Company. He found work life at the company office as disagreeable as some of his other experiences.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==American Civil War==\n[[File:Houghton - Shaw - MS Am 1910 (38) - full.jpg|thumb|240px|Letter from Robert Gould Shaw to his father from Camp Andrew, May 1861]]\nWith the outbreak of the [[American Civil War]], Shaw volunteered to serve with the [[7th New York Militia]].

Andrew]] urged enlistment of African Americans as soldiers to fight the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]]. This proposal was broadly opposed. Many men believed that colored troops would lack discipline, be difficult to train, and would break and run in battle. The general attitude in the North was that colored troops would prove to be an embarrassment and hindrance to regular army units.<ref>[[#emilo|Emilo, 1894]], pp.6-10</ref>\n\nAndrew traveled to Washington, DC in early January 1863 to meet with Secretary of War [[Edwin Stanton]] and repeat his argument for the use of colored troops in the Union army. Stanton was won to his side; on 26 January 1863 Stanton issued an order to Andrew to raise further volunteer regiments to fight for the Union, adding the new recruits \"may include persons of African descent, organized into special corps.\"<ref>[[#emilo|Emilo, 1894]], p.2</ref> Andrew immediately set about doing so, and the [[54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry]] began to be formed. \n\nFor the unit's officers, Andrew sought a certain type of white gentleman, \"...young men of military experience, of firm antislavery principles, ambitious, superior to a vulgar contempt for color, and having faith in the capacity of colored men for military service.\"  Most importantly, he wanted men who understood the stakes, that the success or failure of the endeavor would elevate or depress the manner in which the character of colored persons were viewed throughout the world for many years to come.<ref>[[#emilo|Emilo, 1894]], p.3</ref> Andrew wrote to many individuals prominent in the abolitionist movement, including Morris Hallowell of Philadelphia and Francis Shaw of Boston. \n\nTo command the unit, Andrew already had Shaw's son in mind. Andrew wrote to Francis Shaw about the need to find a leader who would accept the responsibility of the command \"...with a full sense of its importance, with an earnest determination for its success.\"<ref>[[#emilo|Emilo, 1894]], p.1</ref> Included in Andrew's letter was a commission for Robert Shaw to take command of the new regiment.<ref>[[#emilo|Emilo, 1894]], p.3</ref>\n\nCarrying the commission, Francis Shaw traveled to Virginia to speak with his son.<ref>[[#emilo|Emilo, 1894]], pp.3-4</ref> Robert Shaw was hesitant to take the post,<ref name=\"ANB\"/> as he did not believe that authorities would send the unit to the front lines, and he did not want to leave his fellow soldiers. Finally he agreed to take the command.<ref>[[#wise|Wise, 1994]], p. 48</ref> On 6 February he telegraphed his father with his decision.<ref>[[#emilo|Emilo, 1894]], p.5</ref> He was 24 years old. The command came with a [[Colonel (United States)|colonelcy]], the rank commensurate with the position of regimental commander. \n\nAndrew had some difficulty finding enough colored volunteers in Massachusetts to form the regiment. Andrew assured recruits that they would receive the standard pay of 13 dollars a month, and that if they were captured, the government of the United States would insist they be treated as any other soldier.<ref>[[#emilo|Emilo, 1894]], p.17</ref> The Boston area provided enough recruits to form the regiment's \"C\" Company.<ref>[[#emilo|Emilo, 1894]], p.10</ref> The remainder of the regiment was formed with black recruits from all across the North.

The intelligence of the men is a great surprise to me. They learn all the details of guard duty and camp service infinitely more readily than most of the Irish that I have had under my command. There is not the least doubt that we will leave the State with as good a regiment as any that has marched.\"<ref>[[#emilo|Emilo, 1894]], p.20</ref></blockquote>Shaw was promoted to [[Major (United States)|major]] on 31 March 1863, and two weeks later on 17 April was made full colonel. On 30 April the regiment drew 950 [[Pattern 1853 Enfield|Enfield rifled muskets]] and swords for non-commissioned officers (NCOs)<ref>[[#emilo|Emilo, 1894]], p.23</ref> By 11 May more troops had arrived in Boston than were required to man the regiment. The [[55th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment|55th Massachusetts]] was begun with the next round of new recruits.<ref>[[#emilo|Emilo, 1894]], p.24</ref>\n\nOn 28 May Shaw led the men of the 54th [[Military parade|through the streets]] of Boston to the docks, where the regiment boarded a transport steamer and sailed south. The regiment was to be used in a Union campaign against [[Charleston, South Carolina]], a major port.<ref name=\"ABT\"/> The 54th arrived at [[Port Royal Island]] on 4 June, and was placed under the overall command of Major General [[David Hunter]].<ref>[[#emilo|Emilo, 1894]], pp.31-37</ref> Initially the regiment was used to provide manual labor at the loading docks, but Colonel Shaw applied for action. Four days later his regiment boarded onto transport and was sent to [[Hilton Head Island, South Carolina|Hilton Head, South Carolina]].<ref>[[#emilo|Emilo, 1894]], p.39</ref> From there they moved further south to [[St. Simons, Georgia|St. Simons Island]], Georgia, which served as their base of operations. \n\nOn 11 June 1863, the 54th was sent with the [[2nd Regiment South Carolina Volunteer Infantry (African Descent)|2nd South Carolina Volunteers]] (who were also of African-American descent) for a raid against the town of [[Darien, Georgia]]. Overall command of the force was with the senior officer, colonel [[James Montgomery (colonel)|James Montgomery]] of the 2nd South Carolina. Upon reaching the town, Montgomery set his troops to looting it. Shaw was outraged by this behavior by Union troops. \n\nHe ordered his troops to limit their seizures to those items that would be useful for the camp, and committed only one company to the task. After the town had been emptied of all valuables and livestock, Montgomery told Shaw, \"I shall burn this town.\" To Shaw the burning of the town appeared to serve no military purpose, and he knew it would create a great hardship to its residents. In a letter to his family he recalled, \"I told him I did not want to take the responsibility of it, and he was only too happy to take all of it on his own shoulders.\"{{sfn|Charles River Editors|2014|p=23}} Montgomery had the town burned to the ground.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unf.edu/floridahistoryonline/montgomery/ |title=\"Montgomery's Raids in Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina\", by William Lee Apthorp, Lt.

Halpine]], seeking clarification of what was required of him. He asked if Montgomery was acting under orders from General Hunter, stating in part \"I am perfectly willing to burn any place which resists, or gives some reason for such a proceeding; but it seems to me barbarous to turn women and children adrift in that way; and if I am only assisting Colonel Montgomery in a private enterprise of his own, it is very distasteful to me.\" It is not clear if Shaw ever received an answer from Halpine, but Montgomery was in fact carrying out a policy supported by Hunter.<ref>[[#emilo|Emilo, 1894]], p.44</ref>\n\n===Second Battle of Fort Wagner===\n[[File:The Storming of Ft Wagner-lithograph by Kurz and Allison 1890.jpg|thumb|The Storming of [[Fort Wagner]]]]\n\nColonel Shaw and the 54th Regiment were placed under the command of General [[Quincy Adams Gillmore]] and sent to [[Charleston, South Carolina]] to take part in the second attempt to defeat the [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] garrison stationed there. The fort was well armed with an assortment of heavy guns and whose overall strength was underestimated by Union command.<ref>[[#emilo87|Emilo, 1887]], p.12</ref>  At [[Second Battle of Fort Wagner|the battle]], July 18, 1863, along with two [[brigade]]s of white troops, the 54th assaulted Confederate batteries at [[Fort Wagner]]. As the unit hesitated in the face of overwhelming Confederate fire, Shaw led his men into battle by shouting, \"Forward, Fifty-Fourth, forward!\" He mounted a [[parapet]] and urged his men forward, but was shot through the chest three times and died almost instantly. According to the Color Sergeant of the 54th, he was shot and killed early in the battle while trying to lead the unit forward and fell on the outside of the fort.<ref>[[#foote|Foote, 1986]], pp. 697-698</ref><ref>[[#emilo|Emilo, 1894]], p.92</ref>  Some Confederate reports claim his body was hit a total of seven times. The battle had continued to 10 p.m. which ended with heavy Union losses. Among the other fatalities was Gen. [[George Crockett Strong]], mortally wounded;  Col. [[Haldimand S. Putnam]] shot and killed instantly;  Col. [[John Lyman Chatfield]], mortally wounded.<ref>[[#emilo|Emilo, 1894]], pp.85-87</ref> Shaw's 54th Regiment suffered the heaviest losses.<ref>[[#emilo87|Emilo, 1887]], p.16</ref> The Confederates buried Shaw in a mass grave with many of his men, an act they intended as an insult.<ref name=Lodge>[[#lodge|Lodge]], pp. 109-110</ref>\n\nTwo sons of [[Fredrick Douglass]], Charles Douglass and his eldest son, [[Lewis Henry Douglass|Lewis Douglass]], belonged to the 54th regiment. Lewis was wounded at the Battle of Fort Wagner shortly after Shaw fell, and barely managed to retreat to safety.<ref>[[#kendrick|Kendrick, 2008]], pp.138-140</ref>\n\nFollowing the battle, commanding Confederate General [[Johnson Hagood (governor)|Johnson Hagood]] returned the bodies of the other Union officers who had died, but left Shaw's where it was, for burial in a mass grave with the black soldiers. Hagood told a captured Union surgeon that \"Had he [Shaw] been in command of white troops ...\" he would have returned Shaw's body, as was customary for officers, instead of burying it with the fallen black soldiers.<ref name=Foote119>Foote 2003, p. 119</ref>\n\nAlthough the gesture was intended as an insult by Hagood, Shaw's friends and family believed it was an honor for him to be buried with his soldiers. Efforts had been made to recover Shaw's body (which had been stripped and robbed prior to burial). His father publicly proclaimed that he was proud to know that his son was buried with his troops, befitting his role as a soldier and a crusader for emancipation.<ref>Buescher, John. \"[http://teachinghistory.org/history-content/ask-a-historian/24185 Robert Gould Shaw].\" [http://www.teachinghistory.org Teachinghistory.org].

Born into a prominent [[Boston]] [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] family, he accepted command of the first all-[[African Americans|black]] regiment (the [[54th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment|54th Massachusetts]]) in the Northeast. Supporting the promised equal treatment for his troops, he encouraged the men to refuse their pay until it was equal to that of [[White Americans|white]] troops' wage. \n\nHe led his regiment at the [[Second Battle of Fort Wagner]] in July 1863. They attacked a beachhead near [[Charleston, South Carolina]], and Shaw was killed while leading his men to the parapet of the Confederate-held fort. Although the regiment was overwhelmed by firing from the defenses and driven back, suffering many casualties, Shaw's leadership and the regiment became legendary. They inspired hundreds of thousands more African Americans to enlist for the Union helping to turn the tide of the war to its ultimate victory.\n\n==Early life and education==\nShaw was born in Boston to [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionists]] Francis George and [[Sarah Blake Sturgis Shaw|Sarah Blake (Sturgis) Shaw]], who were well-known [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] philanthropists and intellectuals of [[Scottish people|Scottish]] descent. The Shaws had the benefit of a large inheritance left by Shaw's merchant grandfather and namesake Robert Gould Shaw (1775\u20131853).<ref name=BCC1897>{{cite book |author=Boston City Council |title=Exercises at the dedication of the monument to Colonel Robert Gould Shaw and the Fifty-fourth regiment of the Massachusetts infantry (May 31, 1897) |publisher=Municipal Printing Office |location=Boston |year=1897 |url=https://archive.org/stream/exercisesatdedic00bosto#page/n7/mode/2up}}</ref> Shaw had four sisters\u2014 Anna, [[Josephine Shaw Lowell|Josephine]] (Effie), Susanna, and Ellen (Nellie).<ref>{{cite web|title=Caroline Wells Healey Dall journal, 1862-1865, pages with entries for 6-8 August 1863|url=https://www.masshist.org/online/civilwar/index.php?entry_id=934|website=Massachusetts Historical Society|publisher=Massachusetts Historical Society|access-date=16 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nWhen Shaw was five years old, the family moved to a large estate in [[West Roxbury]], adjacent to [[Brook Farm]]. During his teens he traveled and studied for some years in Europe. In 1847, the family moved to [[Staten Island]], New York, settling among a community of [[Intellectual|literati]] and abolitionists while Shaw attended the [[Fordham Preparatory School|Second Division of St. John's College]], a preparatory school, at [[Fordham University|Fordham]]. These studies were at the behest of his uncle Joseph Coolidge Shaw, who had been ordained as a Roman Catholic priest in 1847. He converted to [[Catholicism]] during a trip to Rome, in which he befriended several members of the [[Oxford Movement]], which had begun in the Anglican Church. Robert began his high school-level education at St. John's in 1850, the same year that Joseph Shaw began studying there for entrance into the [[Jesuits]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.fordhamprep.org/page.cfm?p=4856|title=Fordham Preparatory School: Col Robert Gould Shaw|website=www.fordhamprep.org|access-date=2017-05-09}}</ref>\n\nIn 1851, while Shaw was still at St. John's, his uncle died from [[tuberculosis]]. Aged 13,  Shaw had a difficult time adjusting to his surroundings and wrote several despondent letters home to his mother. In one of his letters, he claimed to be so homesick that he often cried in front of his classmates.<ref name=\":0\" /> While at St. John's, he studied Latin, Greek, French, and Spanish, and practiced playing the violin, which he had begun as a young boy. \n\nHe left St. John's in late 1851 before graduation, as the Shaw family departed for an extended tour of Europe. Shaw entered a boarding school in [[Neuch\u00e2tel]], [[Switzerland]] where he stayed for two years. Afterward, his father transferred him to a school with a less strict system of discipline in [[Hanover]], [[Germany]], hoping that it would better suit his restless temperament.<ref name=\":0\" /> While in Hanover, Shaw enjoyed the greater degree of personal freedom at his new school, on one occasion writing home to his mother, \"It's almost impossible not to drink a good deal, because there is so much good wine here.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nWhile Shaw was studying in Europe, [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]], an abolitionist friend of his parents, published her novel ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'' (1852). Shaw read the book multiple times and was moved by its plot and anti-slavery attitude. Around the same time, Shaw wrote that his patriotism had been bolstered after encountering several instances of anti-Americanism among some Europeans. He expressed interest to his parents in attending [[West Point]] or joining the [[US Navy|Navy]]. Because Shaw had had a longstanding difficulty with taking orders and obeying authority figures, his parents did not view this ambition seriously.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nShaw returned to the United States in 1856. From 1856 until 1859 he attended [[Harvard University]], joining the [[Porcellian Club]],<ref>{{cite book|title=Catalogue of the Porcellian Club of Harvard University|date=1877|publisher=Harvard university. Porcellian club|location=Boston|page=[https://archive.org/details/catalogueofporce00harv/page/54 54]|url=https://archive.org/details/catalogueofporce00harv|accessdate=16 January 2017}}</ref> and the [[Hasty Pudding Club]],<ref name=\":0\" /> but he withdrew before graduating. He had been a member of the class of 1860. Shaw found Harvard no easier to adjust to than any of his previous schools and wrote to his parents about his discontent.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAfter leaving Harvard in 1859, Shaw returned to Staten Island to work with one of his uncles at the mercantile firm Henry P. Sturgis and Company. He found work life at the company office as disagreeable as some of his other experiences.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==American Civil War==\n[[File:Houghton - Shaw - MS Am 1910 (38) - full.jpg|thumb|240px|Letter from Robert Gould Shaw to his father from Camp Andrew, May 1861]]\nWith the outbreak of the [[American Civil War]], Shaw volunteered to serve with the [[7th New York Militia]].

Andrew]] urged enlistment of African Americans as soldiers to fight the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]]. This proposal was broadly opposed. Many men believed that colored troops would lack discipline, be difficult to train, and would break and run in battle. The general attitude in the North was that colored troops would prove to be an embarrassment and hindrance to regular army units.<ref>[[#emilo|Emilo, 1894]], pp.6-10</ref>\n\nAndrew traveled to Washington, DC in early January 1863 to meet with Secretary of War [[Edwin Stanton]] and repeat his argument for the use of colored troops in the Union army. Stanton was won to his side; on 26 January 1863 Stanton issued an order to Andrew to raise further volunteer regiments to fight for the Union, adding the new recruits \"may include persons of African descent, organized into special corps.\"<ref>[[#emilo|Emilo, 1894]], p.2</ref> Andrew immediately set about doing so, and the [[54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry]] began to be formed. \n\nFor the unit's officers, Andrew sought a certain type of white gentleman, \"...young men of military experience, of firm antislavery principles, ambitious, superior to a vulgar contempt for color, and having faith in the capacity of colored men for military service.\"  Most importantly, he wanted men who understood the stakes, that the success or failure of the endeavor would elevate or depress the manner in which the character of colored persons were viewed throughout the world for many years to come.<ref>[[#emilo|Emilo, 1894]], p.3</ref> Andrew wrote to many individuals prominent in the abolitionist movement, including Morris Hallowell of Philadelphia and Francis Shaw of Boston. \n\nTo command the unit, Andrew already had Shaw's son in mind. Andrew wrote to Francis Shaw about the need to find a leader who would accept the responsibility of the command \"...with a full sense of its importance, with an earnest determination for its success.\"<ref>[[#emilo|Emilo, 1894]], p.1</ref> Included in Andrew's letter was a commission for Robert Shaw to take command of the new regiment.<ref>[[#emilo|Emilo, 1894]], p.3</ref>\n\nCarrying the commission, Francis Shaw traveled to Virginia to speak with his son.<ref>[[#emilo|Emilo, 1894]], pp.3-4</ref> Robert Shaw was hesitant to take the post,<ref name=\"ANB\"/> as he did not believe that authorities would send the unit to the front lines, and he did not want to leave his fellow soldiers. Finally he agreed to take the command.<ref>[[#wise|Wise, 1994]], p. 48</ref> On 6 February he telegraphed his father with his decision.<ref>[[#emilo|Emilo, 1894]], p.5</ref> He was 24 years old. The command came with a [[Colonel (United States)|colonelcy]], the rank commensurate with the position of regimental commander. \n\nAndrew had some difficulty finding enough colored volunteers in Massachusetts to form the regiment. Andrew assured recruits that they would receive the standard pay of 13 dollars a month, and that if they were captured, the government of the United States would insist they be treated as any other soldier.<ref>[[#emilo|Emilo, 1894]], p.17</ref> The Boston area provided enough recruits to form the regiment's \"C\" Company.<ref>[[#emilo|Emilo, 1894]], p.10</ref> The remainder of the regiment was formed with black recruits from all across the North.

The intelligence of the men is a great surprise to me. They learn all the details of guard duty and camp service infinitely more readily than most of the Irish that I have had under my command. There is not the least doubt that we will leave the State with as good a regiment as any that has marched.\"<ref>[[#emilo|Emilo, 1894]], p.20</ref></blockquote>Shaw was promoted to [[Major (United States)|major]] on 31 March 1863, and two weeks later on 17 April was made full colonel. On 30 April the regiment drew 950 [[Pattern 1853 Enfield|Enfield rifled muskets]] and swords for non-commissioned officers (NCOs)<ref>[[#emilo|Emilo, 1894]], p.23</ref> By 11 May more troops had arrived in Boston than were required to man the regiment. The [[55th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment|55th Massachusetts]] was begun with the next round of new recruits.<ref>[[#emilo|Emilo, 1894]], p.24</ref>\n\nOn 28 May Shaw led the men of the 54th [[Military parade|through the streets]] of Boston to the docks, where the regiment boarded a transport steamer and sailed south. The regiment was to be used in a Union campaign against [[Charleston, South Carolina]], a major port.<ref name=\"ABT\"/> The 54th arrived at [[Port Royal Island]] on 4 June, and was placed under the overall command of Major General [[David Hunter]].<ref>[[#emilo|Emilo, 1894]], pp.31-37</ref> Initially the regiment was used to provide manual labor at the loading docks, but Colonel Shaw applied for action. Four days later his regiment boarded onto transport and was sent to [[Hilton Head Island, South Carolina|Hilton Head, South Carolina]].<ref>[[#emilo|Emilo, 1894]], p.39</ref> From there they moved further south to [[St. Simons, Georgia|St. Simons Island]], Georgia, which served as their base of operations. \n\nOn 11 June 1863, the 54th was sent with the [[2nd Regiment South Carolina Volunteer Infantry (African Descent)|2nd South Carolina Volunteers]] (who were also of African-American descent) for a raid against the town of [[Darien, Georgia]]. Overall command of the force was with the senior officer, colonel [[James Montgomery (colonel)|James Montgomery]] of the 2nd South Carolina. Upon reaching the town, Montgomery set his troops to looting it. Shaw was outraged by this behavior by Union troops. \n\nHe ordered his troops to limit their seizures to those items that would be useful for the camp, and committed only one company to the task. After the town had been emptied of all valuables and livestock, Montgomery told Shaw, \"I shall burn this town.\" To Shaw the burning of the town appeared to serve no military purpose, and he knew it would create a great hardship to its residents. In a letter to his family he recalled, \"I told him I did not want to take the responsibility of it, and he was only too happy to take all of it on his own shoulders.\"{{sfn|Charles River Editors|2014|p=23}} Montgomery had the town burned to the ground.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unf.edu/floridahistoryonline/montgomery/ |title=\"Montgomery's Raids in Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina\", by William Lee Apthorp, Lt.

Halpine]], seeking clarification of what was required of him. He asked if Montgomery was acting under orders from General Hunter, stating in part \"I am perfectly willing to burn any place which resists, or gives some reason for such a proceeding; but it seems to me barbarous to turn women and children adrift in that way; and if I am only assisting Colonel Montgomery in a private enterprise of his own, it is very distasteful to me.\" It is not clear if Shaw ever received an answer from Halpine, but Montgomery was in fact carrying out a policy supported by Hunter.<ref>[[#emilo|Emilo, 1894]], p.44</ref>\n\n===Second Battle of Fort Wagner===\n[[File:The Storming of Ft Wagner-lithograph by Kurz and Allison 1890.jpg|thumb|The Storming of [[Fort Wagner]]]]\n\nColonel Shaw and the 54th Regiment were placed under the command of General [[Quincy Adams Gillmore]] and sent to [[Charleston, South Carolina]] to take part in the second attempt to defeat the [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] garrison stationed there. The fort was well armed with an assortment of heavy guns and whose overall strength was underestimated by Union command.<ref>[[#emilo87|Emilo, 1887]], p.12</ref>  At [[Second Battle of Fort Wagner|the battle]], July 18, 1863, along with two [[brigade]]s of white troops, the 54th assaulted Confederate batteries at [[Fort Wagner]]. As the unit hesitated in the face of overwhelming Confederate fire, Shaw led his men into battle by shouting, \"Forward, Fifty-Fourth, forward!\" He mounted a [[parapet]] and urged his men forward, but was shot through the chest three times and died almost instantly. According to the Color Sergeant of the 54th, he was shot and killed early in the battle while trying to lead the unit forward and fell on the outside of the fort.<ref>[[#foote|Foote, 1986]], pp. 697-698</ref><ref>[[#emilo|Emilo, 1894]], p.92</ref>  Some Confederate reports claim his body was hit a total of seven times.

Hagood told a captured Union surgeon that \"Had he [Shaw] been in command of white troops ...\" he would have returned Shaw's body, as was customary for officers, instead of burying it with the fallen black soldiers.<ref name=Foote119>Foote 2003, p. 119</ref>\n\nAlthough the gesture was intended as an insult by Hagood, Shaw's friends and family believed it was an honor for him to be buried with his soldiers. Efforts had been made to recover Shaw's body (which had been stripped and robbed prior to burial). His father publicly proclaimed that he was proud to know that his son was buried with his troops, befitting his role as a soldier and a crusader for emancipation.<ref>Buescher, John. \"[http://teachinghistory.org/history-content/ask-a-historian/24185 Robert Gould Shaw].\" [http://www.teachinghistory.org Teachinghistory.org].

For a brief period during the [[Russian Civil War]] in 1918\u20131920, it served as the capital of the anti-Bolshevik [[Siberian Republic|Russian State]] and held the imperial gold reserves.\n\nOmsk serves as the [[episcopal see]] of the bishop of Omsk and [[Tara, Omsk Oblast|Tara]], as well as the administrative seat of the Imam of Siberia. The mayor is \nOksana Fadina.\n\n==History==\n{{See also|Timeline of Omsk}}\n\nThe wooden fort of Omsk was built in 1716 by a cossack unit led by Ivan Buchholz to protect the expanding Russian frontier along the [[Ishim River|Ishim]] and the [[Irtysh River|Irtysh]] rivers against the [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]] and [[Dzungar people|Dzungar]] nomads of the Steppes.<ref>[http://www.admomsk.ru/web/guest/city/history/timeline Omsk history timeline] (in Russian)</ref> In 1768 Om fortress was relocated. The original [[Tobolsk]] and the restored [[Tara, Omsk Oblast|Tara]] gates, along with the original German Lutheran Church and several public buildings are left from that time. Omsk was granted town status in 1782.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.admomsk.ru/web/en/city/history|title=History of the City of Omsk|website=www.admomsk.ru}}</ref>\n\nIn 1822 Omsk became an administrative capital of Western Siberia and later in 1882 the center of the vast Steppes region (today the northern part of [[Kazakhstan]]) and [[Akmolinsk Oblast (Russian Empire)|Akmolinsk Oblast]], in particular acquiring several churches and cathedrals of various denominations, mosques, a synagogue, the governor-general's mansion, and a military academy.<ref>''Siberia and the Exile System'' {{ISBN|978-1-108-04823-1}} p. 480</ref> But as the frontier receded and its military importance diminished, the town fell into lethargy. For that time Omsk became a major center of the Siberian exile. From 1850 to 1854 [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]] served his sentence in an Omsk [[katorga]] prison.\n\nDevelopment of the city was catalyzed with the construction of the Trans-Siberian Railway in the 1890s that affected significance of Omsk as a logistic hub. Many trade companies established stores and offices in Omsk defining the character of the city center. British, Dutch, and German consulates were established roughly at the same time in order to represent their commercial interests. The pinnacle of development for pre-revolutionary Omsk was the Siberian Exposition of Agriculture and Industry in 1910. Popularity of the World Fairs contributed to the image of Omsk as the \"[[Chicago]] of [[Siberia]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thinkrussia.com/life-arts/trans-siberian-railway-visiting-omsk-entering-siberia|title=''thinkrussia.com''|publisher=}}</ref> Conversely, others find the \"Milwaukee of Siberia\" to be a more fitting comparison.\n\nSoon after the [[October Revolution]], anti-Bolshevik [[White movement|White forces]] seized control of Omsk. The \"[[Provisional All-Russian Government]]\" was established here in 1918, headed by the Arctic explorer and decorated war hero [[Aleksandr Kolchak|Admiral Kolchak]]. Omsk was proclaimed the capital of Russia, and its central bank was tasked with safekeeping the former empire's gold reserves. These were guarded by a garrison of former Czechoslovakian POWs trapped in Siberia by the chaos of [[World War I]] and the subsequent Revolution. {{Citation needed|date=February 2014}} Omsk became a prime target for the [[Red Army]] leadership, which viewed it as a major target of their Siberian campaign and eventually forced Kolchak and his government to abandon the city and retreat along the Trans-Siberian eastward to [[Irkutsk]]. Bolshevik forces entered the city in 1919.\n\n===Soviet period===\n[[File:Omsk Pushkin Library.jpg|thumb|Pushkin State Library|left]]\n\nThe Soviet government preferred the young Novonikolayevsk (later known as [[Novosibirsk]]) as the administrative center of Western Siberia, prompting the mass transfer of administrative, cultural, and educational functions from Omsk. This somewhat stunted Omsk's growth and sparked a continuing rivalry between the two cities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kachaloff.narod.ru/history.htm|title=History of Omsk|website=kachaloff.narod.ru}}</ref> Omsk received new life as a result of [[World War II]]. Because it was both far from the fighting and had a well-developed infrastructure, Omsk provided a perfect haven for much of the industry evacuated away from the frontlines in 1941. Additionally, contingency plans were made to transfer the provisional Soviet capital to Omsk in the event of a German victory during the [[Battle of Moscow]] (October 1941 to January 1942).<ref>[http://www.edb.gov.hk/attachment/en/curriculum-development/kla/pshe/references-and-resources/history/conflict_and_cooperation_source6_eng.pdf Lecture 3:3: \u201cWorld War II\u201d \u2013 The Battle of Moscow], ''edb.gov.hk''</ref> At the end of the war, Omsk remained a major industrial center, subsequently becoming a leader in Soviet military production.\n[[File:Lenmostzakat.jpg|thumb|Leningrad bridge over the Irtysh]]\n\nMilitary industries which moved to Omsk included part of the [[OKMO]] tank-design bureau in 1941, and [[S.M. Kirov Factory no. 185]] from [[Chelyabinsk]], in 1962. The Kirov Factory and [[Omsk Transmash]] design bureau (KBTM) produced [[T-80]] tanks from the 1970s, and were responsible for the [[BTR-T]], [[TOS-1]], and the prototype [[Black Eagle tank]]. Omsk Transmash declared bankruptcy in 2002.\n\nIn the 1950s, following the development of the oil and natural-gas field in Siberia, an oil-refining complex was built, along with an entire \"town of oil workers\", expanding Omsk northward along the [[Irtysh]]. It is currently the largest such complex in Russia. [[Gazprom Neft]], the parent company, is the largest employer in the city, wielding its tax rates as leverage in negotiations with municipal and regional authorities.\n\n===Post-Soviet period===\nFollowing the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], Omsk experienced a period of economic instability and political stagnation. Most of the city's large businesses, which had previously been state owned, were fought over by members of the former party elite, the emerging [[nouveau riche]], and fast growing criminal syndicates. The most notorious cases involved the privatization of [[Sibneft]], a major oil company, which dragged on for several years. Until the end of the 1990s, political life in Omsk was defined by an ongoing feud between the oblast and city authorities. The resulting conflict made at least two points of view available to the public and served as the impetus for some improvements to the city's infrastructure and cultural life. These included the construction of new leisure parks and the renovation of the city's historic center, the establishment of the annual [[Siberian International Marathon]], and of the annual City Days Festival. Despite this, internal political competition drained the Omsk's resources and served as a major obstacle for smooth government operations and city development.\n\n==Geography==\n===Location===\nOmsk is situated on the south of the [[West Siberian Plain]] along the banks of the north-flowing [[Irtysh River|Irtysh]] at its [[confluence]] with the [[Om River]]. The city has an elevation of {{convert|87|m|sp=us}} [[above mean sea level]] at its highest point.\n\nOmsk is an important railroad hub, and is the junction point for the northern and southern branches of the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]]. The city also serves as a major hub for the regional highway network. River-port facilities handle both passengers and freight, giving the city access to navigating the extensive waterways of the [[Irtysh River|Irtysh]] and [[Ob River]]. The waterways connect Omsk with the coal and mineral-mining towns further up the river in [[Kazakhstan]], as well as with the [[petroleum industry|oil, natural gas]] and lumber operations of northern Siberia. Omsk is served by the [[Tsentralny Airport]], which offers access to domestic and international (primarily, German and Kazakh) destinations, making the city an important aviation hub for Siberia and the [[Russian Far East]].\n\nIt is about 450 km north of Kazakhstan's capital [[Nur-Sultan]], and 600 km west of Siberia's largest city [[Novosibirsk]].\n\n===Climate===\nOmsk has a [[humid continental climate]] Dfb characterized by dramatic swings of weather. Average daily temperatures, taken over the past three decades, are {{convert|+20|C}} for July and {{convert|-17|C}} for January, although temperatures can very rarely reach {{convert|+40|C}} in the summer and very rarely drop to {{convert|-45|C}} in the winter. On average, Omsk sees over&nbsp;300 sunny days a year ([[List of cities by sunshine duration|2201 hours]]). The average annual [[precipitation]] is {{convert|415|mm|sp=us}}.\n\n{{Weather box\n|location=Omsk\n|metric first=yes\n|single line=yes\n|Jan record high C=4.2\n|Feb record high C=8.0\n|Mar record high C=14.1\n|Apr record high C=31.3\n|May record high C=35.5\n|Jun record high C=40.1\n|Jul record high C = 40.4\n|Aug record high C = 38.0\n|Sep record high C = 32.9\n|Oct record high C = 27.4\n|Nov record high C = 16.1\n|Dec record high C = 4.5\n|year record high C = 40.4\n|Jan high C = \u221212.0\n|Feb high C = \u221210.3\n|Mar high C = -2.5\n|Apr high C = 9.1\n|May high C = 19.0\n|Jun high C = 23.9\n|Jul high C = 25.3\n|Aug high C = 22.7\n|Sep high C = 15.9\n|Oct high C = 8.1\n|Nov high C = -3.7\n|Dec high C = \u22129.8\n|year high C = 7.1\n|Jan mean C = -16.3\n|Feb mean C = -15.0\n|Mar mean C = -7.3\n|Apr mean C = 3.7\n|May mean C = 12.5\n|Jun mean C = 18.0\n|Jul mean C = 19.6\n|Aug mean C = 16.9\n|Sep mean C = 10.4\n|Oct mean C = 3.5\n|Nov mean C = -7.3\n|Dec mean C = -13.8\n|year mean C = 2.1\n|Jan low C = \u221220.5\n|Feb low C = \u221219.4\n|Mar low C = \u221212.0\n|Apr low C = -1.0\n|May low C = 6.3\n|Jun low C = 12.0\n|Jul low C = 14.2\n|Aug low C = 11.6\n|Sep low C = 5.7\n|Oct low C = -0.3\n|Nov low C = \u221210.5\n|Dec low C = \u221217.9\n|year low C = -2.7\n|Jan record low C = \u221245.1\n|Feb record low C = \u221245.5\n|Mar record low C = \u221241.1\n|Apr record low C = \u221226.4\n|May record low C = \u221212.9\n|Jun record low C = -3.1\n|Jul record low C = 2.1\n|Aug record low C = \u22121.7\n|Sep record low C = \u22127.6\n|Oct record low C = \u221228.1\n|Nov record low C = \u221241.2\n|Dec record low C = \u221244.7\n|year record low C = \u221245.5\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation mm = 23\n|Feb precipitation mm = 18\n|Mar precipitation mm = 17\n|Apr precipitation mm = 21\n|May precipitation mm = 35\n|Jun precipitation mm = 51\n|Jul precipitation mm = 66\n|Aug precipitation mm = 54\n|Sep precipitation mm = 37\n|Oct precipitation mm = 30\n|Nov precipitation mm = 34\n|Dec precipitation mm = 29\n|year precipitation mm = 415\n|Jan humidity = 80\n|Feb humidity = 78\n|Mar humidity = 76\n|Apr humidity = 64\n|May humidity = 54\n|Jun humidity = 60\n|Jul humidity = 68\n|Aug humidity = 70\n|Sep humidity = 70\n|Oct humidity = 74\n|Nov humidity = 81\n|Dec humidity = 81\n|year humidity = 71\n|Jan rain days = 1\n|Feb rain days = 0.4\n|Mar rain days = 3\n|Apr rain days = 10\n|May rain days = 17\n|Jun rain days = 17\n|Jul rain days = 18\n|Aug rain days = 19\n|Sep rain days = 18\n|Oct rain days = 13\n|Nov rain days = 5\n|Dec rain days = 1\n|year rain days = 122\n|Jan snow days = 28\n|Feb snow days = 25\n|Mar snow days = 18\n|Apr snow days = 9\n|May snow days = 2\n|Jun snow days = 0.2\n|Jul snow days = 0\n|Aug snow days = 0\n|Sep snow days = 1\n|Oct snow days = 11\n|Nov snow days = 22\n|Dec snow days = 28\n|year snow days = 144\n|Jan sun = 68\n|Feb sun = 125\n|Mar sun = 184\n|Apr sun = 235\n|May sun = 284\n|Jun sun = 319\n|Jul sun = 321\n|Aug sun = 248\n|Sep sun = 180\n|Oct sun = 105\n|Nov sun = 71\n|Dec sun = 61\n|year sun = 2201\n|source 1 = Pogoda.ru.net<ref name = pogoda >{{cite web\n| url = http://www.pogodaiklimat.ru/climate/28698.htm\n| title = Weather and Climate -

With a population of 1,154,116, it is Russia's second-largest city east of the [[Ural Mountains]] after [[Novosibirsk]], and seventh by size nationally.<ref name=\"2010Census\">{{ru-pop-ref|2010Census}}</ref> Omsk acts as an essential [[transport node]], serving as a train station for [[Trans-Siberian Railway]] and as a staging post for the [[Irtysh River]].\n\nDuring the [[Russian Empire|Imperial]] era, Omsk used to be the seat of the Governor General of Western Siberia and, later, of the Governor General of the [[Steppe]]s. For a brief period during the [[Russian Civil War]] in 1918\u20131920, it served as the capital of the anti-Bolshevik [[Siberian Republic|Russian State]] and held the imperial gold reserves.\n\nOmsk serves as the [[episcopal see]] of the bishop of Omsk and [[Tara, Omsk Oblast|Tara]], as well as the administrative seat of the Imam of Siberia. The mayor is \nOksana Fadina.\n\n==History==\n{{See also|Timeline of Omsk}}\n\nThe wooden fort of Omsk was built in 1716 by a cossack unit led by Ivan Buchholz to protect the expanding Russian frontier along the [[Ishim River|Ishim]] and the [[Irtysh River|Irtysh]] rivers against the [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]] and [[Dzungar people|Dzungar]] nomads of the Steppes.<ref>[http://www.admomsk.ru/web/guest/city/history/timeline Omsk history timeline] (in Russian)</ref> In 1768 Om fortress was relocated. The original [[Tobolsk]] and the restored [[Tara, Omsk Oblast|Tara]] gates, along with the original German Lutheran Church and several public buildings are left from that time. Omsk was granted town status in 1782.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.admomsk.ru/web/en/city/history|title=History of the City of Omsk|website=www.admomsk.ru}}</ref>\n\nIn 1822 Omsk became an administrative capital of Western Siberia and later in 1882 the center of the vast Steppes region (today the northern part of [[Kazakhstan]]) and [[Akmolinsk Oblast (Russian Empire)|Akmolinsk Oblast]], in particular acquiring several churches and cathedrals of various denominations, mosques, a synagogue, the governor-general's mansion, and a military academy.<ref>''Siberia and the Exile System'' {{ISBN|978-1-108-04823-1}} p. 480</ref> But as the frontier receded and its military importance diminished, the town fell into lethargy. For that time Omsk became a major center of the Siberian exile. From 1850 to 1854 [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]] served his sentence in an Omsk [[katorga]] prison.\n\nDevelopment of the city was catalyzed with the construction of the Trans-Siberian Railway in the 1890s that affected significance of Omsk as a logistic hub. Many trade companies established stores and offices in Omsk defining the character of the city center. British, Dutch, and German consulates were established roughly at the same time in order to represent their commercial interests. The pinnacle of development for pre-revolutionary Omsk was the Siberian Exposition of Agriculture and Industry in 1910. Popularity of the World Fairs contributed to the image of Omsk as the \"[[Chicago]] of [[Siberia]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thinkrussia.com/life-arts/trans-siberian-railway-visiting-omsk-entering-siberia|title=''thinkrussia.com''|publisher=}}</ref> Conversely, others find the \"Milwaukee of Siberia\" to be a more fitting comparison.\n\nSoon after the [[October Revolution]], anti-Bolshevik [[White movement|White forces]] seized control of Omsk. The \"[[Provisional All-Russian Government]]\" was established here in 1918, headed by the Arctic explorer and decorated war hero [[Aleksandr Kolchak|Admiral Kolchak]]. Omsk was proclaimed the capital of Russia, and its central bank was tasked with safekeeping the former empire's gold reserves. These were guarded by a garrison of former Czechoslovakian POWs trapped in Siberia by the chaos of [[World War I]] and the subsequent Revolution. {{Citation needed|date=February 2014}} Omsk became a prime target for the [[Red Army]] leadership, which viewed it as a major target of their Siberian campaign and eventually forced Kolchak and his government to abandon the city and retreat along the Trans-Siberian eastward to [[Irkutsk]]. Bolshevik forces entered the city in 1919.\n\n===Soviet period===\n[[File:Omsk Pushkin Library.jpg|thumb|Pushkin State Library|left]]\n\nThe Soviet government preferred the young Novonikolayevsk (later known as [[Novosibirsk]]) as the administrative center of Western Siberia, prompting the mass transfer of administrative, cultural, and educational functions from Omsk. This somewhat stunted Omsk's growth and sparked a continuing rivalry between the two cities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kachaloff.narod.ru/history.htm|title=History of Omsk|website=kachaloff.narod.ru}}</ref> Omsk received new life as a result of [[World War II]]. Because it was both far from the fighting and had a well-developed infrastructure, Omsk provided a perfect haven for much of the industry evacuated away from the frontlines in 1941. Additionally, contingency plans were made to transfer the provisional Soviet capital to Omsk in the event of a German victory during the [[Battle of Moscow]] (October 1941 to January 1942).<ref>[http://www.edb.gov.hk/attachment/en/curriculum-development/kla/pshe/references-and-resources/history/conflict_and_cooperation_source6_eng.pdf Lecture 3:3: \u201cWorld War II\u201d \u2013 The Battle of Moscow], ''edb.gov.hk''</ref> At the end of the war, Omsk remained a major industrial center, subsequently becoming a leader in Soviet military production.\n[[File:Lenmostzakat.jpg|thumb|Leningrad bridge over the Irtysh]]\n\nMilitary industries which moved to Omsk included part of the [[OKMO]] tank-design bureau in 1941, and [[S.M. Kirov Factory no. 185]] from [[Chelyabinsk]], in 1962. The Kirov Factory and [[Omsk Transmash]] design bureau (KBTM) produced [[T-80]] tanks from the 1970s, and were responsible for the [[BTR-T]], [[TOS-1]], and the prototype [[Black Eagle tank]]. Omsk Transmash declared bankruptcy in 2002.\n\nIn the 1950s, following the development of the oil and natural-gas field in Siberia, an oil-refining complex was built, along with an entire \"town of oil workers\", expanding Omsk northward along the [[Irtysh]]. It is currently the largest such complex in Russia. [[Gazprom Neft]], the parent company, is the largest employer in the city, wielding its tax rates as leverage in negotiations with municipal and regional authorities.\n\n===Post-Soviet period===\nFollowing the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], Omsk experienced a period of economic instability and political stagnation. Most of the city's large businesses, which had previously been state owned, were fought over by members of the former party elite, the emerging [[nouveau riche]], and fast growing criminal syndicates. The most notorious cases involved the privatization of [[Sibneft]], a major oil company, which dragged on for several years. Until the end of the 1990s, political life in Omsk was defined by an ongoing feud between the oblast and city authorities. The resulting conflict made at least two points of view available to the public and served as the impetus for some improvements to the city's infrastructure and cultural life. These included the construction of new leisure parks and the renovation of the city's historic center, the establishment of the annual [[Siberian International Marathon]], and of the annual City Days Festival. Despite this, internal political competition drained the Omsk's resources and served as a major obstacle for smooth government operations and city development.\n\n==Geography==\n===Location===\nOmsk is situated on the south of the [[West Siberian Plain]] along the banks of the north-flowing [[Irtysh River|Irtysh]] at its [[confluence]] with the [[Om River]]. The city has an elevation of {{convert|87|m|sp=us}} [[above mean sea level]] at its highest point.\n\nOmsk is an important railroad hub, and is the junction point for the northern and southern branches of the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]]. The city also serves as a major hub for the regional highway network. River-port facilities handle both passengers and freight, giving the city access to navigating the extensive waterways of the [[Irtysh River|Irtysh]] and [[Ob River]]. The waterways connect Omsk with the coal and mineral-mining towns further up the river in [[Kazakhstan]], as well as with the [[petroleum industry|oil, natural gas]] and lumber operations of northern Siberia. Omsk is served by the [[Tsentralny Airport]], which offers access to domestic and international (primarily, German and Kazakh) destinations, making the city an important aviation hub for Siberia and the [[Russian Far East]].\n\nIt is about 450 km north of Kazakhstan's capital [[Nur-Sultan]], and 600 km west of Siberia's largest city [[Novosibirsk]].\n\n===Climate===\nOmsk has a [[humid continental climate]] Dfb characterized by dramatic swings of weather.

The name Assiniboine comes from the term ''Asiniibwaan'', from [[Ojibwe language|Ojibwe]], meaning \"Stone Siouans\". The reason they were called this was that Assiniboine people used heated stone to boil their food. In [[Canada]], Assiniboine people are known as [[Nakoda (Stoney)|Stoney Indians]], while they called themselves [[Nakota|Nakota or Nakoda]], meaning \"allies\"''.''\n\n==Classification==\nThe Dakotan group of the Siouan family has five main divisions: [[Dakota people|Dakota]] (Santee-Sisseton), Dakota (Yankton-Yanktonai), [[Lakota people|Lakota]] (Teton), Nakoda (Assiniboine) and [[Nakoda (Stoney)|Nakoda]] (Stoney).{{sfn|Parks|DeMallie|1992}}<ref name=\":8\">Miller, D., Smith, D., McGeshick, J.

Montana: Montana Historical Society Press.</ref> Along with the closely related [[Stoney language|Stoney]], Assiniboine is an '''n''' variety of the Dakotan languages, meaning its autonym is pronounced with an initial '''n''' (thus: ''Nak\u02b0\u00f3ta'' as opposed to [[Sioux language|''Dak\u02b0\u00f3ta'']] or [[Lakota language|''Lak\u02b0\u00f3ta'']], and ''Nak\u02b0\u00f3da'' or ''Nak\u02b0\u00f3na'' as opposed to ''Dak\u02b0\u00f3d'' or ''Lak\u02b0\u00f3l''). The Assiniboine language is also closely related to the [[Sioux language]] and to the [[Stoney language]] (likewise called Nakoda or Nakota), although they are hardly mutually intelligible.[[File:The Family Tree.png|thumb|The Siouan Family of Languages{{sfn|West|2003}}]]\n\n===Official status===\nThe Assiniboine language is not an government-recognized official language of any state or region where Assiniboine people live.

Many linguists consider [[Assiniboine]] and [[Stoney language|Stoney]] to be dialects. However, they are mutually unintelligible. Parks and DeMallie report that they are not variant forms of a single dialect, but that Assiniboine is closer to the Sioux dialects than it is to Stoney.

As suggested by the name of the system, the variation in pronunciations of certain words follows the D-N-L rule. A typical example is given below:{{sfn|Parks|DeMallie|1992}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|'''English meaning'''\n|'''greasy'''\n|-\n|Santee-Sisseton\n|''sda''\n|-\n|Yankton-Yanktonai\n|''sda''\n|-\n|Teton\n|''sla''\n|-\n|Assiniboine\n|''sna''\n|-\n|Stoney\n|''sna''\n|}\nSantee-Sisseton and Yankton-Yanktonai are languages that belong to the Dakotan group and Teton is a language in the Lakotan group. The table above illustrates a typical variation amongst these three languages. Just as the name of these three tribes suggest, the Dakota language, the Lakota language and the Nakota (Assiniboine) language have respective inclinations towards /d/, /l/, and /n/ in some substitutable consonants.\n\n==== Arguments against the Classification System ====\nSome scholars argue that the D-N-L classification system may not be totally accurate due to the non-rigidness of the substitution form.{{sfn|Parks|DeMallie|1992}} Siouan Indians live on an expansive continuum such that the distinction between different languages does not manifest in a rigid, clear-cutting criterion. Historically, linguists have debated on Yankton-Yanktonai languages and their proper positions into the D-N-L classification system, but the coexistence of /d/ and /n/ phonemes made such classification doubtful. This example of lexical difference between the languages of the Siouan group illustrates another possible distinction besides the D-N-L variations.{{sfn|Parks|DeMallie|1992}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|'''English meaning'''\n|'''horse'''\n|-\n|Santee-Sisseton || s\u00fakataka\n|-\n|Yankton-Yanktonai || sukawaka\n|-\n|Teton || sukawak\u00e1\n|-\n|Assiniboine || s\u00fakataka\n|-\n|Stoney || suwat\u00e1ga\n|}\n\n==Sounds/Phonology==\nThe phonemic inventory has 27 consonants, which includes aspirated, plain, and ejective stops. In addition to this, it has five [[oral vowels]] and three [[nasal vowels]]. It is a structure-preserving language. Assiniboine has no definite or indefinite articles, no nominal case system, and no verbal tense marking. Clauses unmarked are \"realized,\" while clauses marked as \"potential\" by means of verbal enclitic, which is successful in producing a future/non-future distinction. The verbal system is split into active and stative (split-intransitive). The active object pronominal affixes coincide with the stative verbs of the subject pronominal affixes.{{sfn|Cumberland|2005}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"2\"|\n!

Elements order might be different from the canonical SOV, this is not free nor scrambling word order, but instead, the result of topicalization or other movements. Out of context sentences are always interpreted as SOV order even if it sounds odd. For example, 'the man bit the dog', unless an element is moved into a focus\nposition. Focused element sentences are highly marked, and practically, a strange semantic reading is preferred over an interpretation of OSV. For example, the following sentence was interpreted as 'A banana ate the boy' by a native speaker, and to get the OSV reading out of it the object must be stressed, for example if the sentence was given as a reply to the question 'What did the boy eat?'.{{sfn|West|2003|pp=48\u201349}} \n:{{interlinear|lang=asb\n|\u0161k\u00f3\u0161kobena w\u00e3\u017ei hok\u0161\u00edna \u017ee y\u00fada.\n|banana a boy DET ate \n|'A banana ate the boy.'

As suggested by the name of the system, the variation in pronunciations of certain words follows the D-N-L rule. A typical example is given below:{{sfn|Parks|DeMallie|1992}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|'''English meaning'''\n|'''greasy'''\n|-\n|Santee-Sisseton\n|''sda''\n|-\n|Yankton-Yanktonai\n|''sda''\n|-\n|Teton\n|''sla''\n|-\n|Assiniboine\n|''sna''\n|-\n|Stoney\n|''sna''\n|}\nSantee-Sisseton and Yankton-Yanktonai are languages that belong to the Dakotan group and Teton is a language in the Lakotan group. The table above illustrates a typical variation amongst these three languages. Just as the name of these three tribes suggest, the Dakota language, the Lakota language and the Nakota (Assiniboine) language have respective inclinations towards /d/, /l/, and /n/ in some substitutable consonants.\n\n==== Arguments against the Classification System ====\nSome scholars argue that the D-N-L classification system may not be totally accurate due to the non-rigidness of the substitution form.{{sfn|Parks|DeMallie|1992}} Siouan Indians live on an expansive continuum such that the distinction between different languages does not manifest in a rigid, clear-cutting criterion. Historically, linguists have debated on Yankton-Yanktonai languages and their proper positions into the D-N-L classification system, but the coexistence of /d/ and /n/ phonemes made such classification doubtful. This example of lexical difference between the languages of the Siouan group illustrates another possible distinction besides the D-N-L variations.{{sfn|Parks|DeMallie|1992}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|'''English meaning'''\n|'''horse'''\n|-\n|Santee-Sisseton || s\u00fakataka\n|-\n|Yankton-Yanktonai || sukawaka\n|-\n|Teton || sukawak\u00e1\n|-\n|Assiniboine || s\u00fakataka\n|-\n|Stoney || suwat\u00e1ga\n|}\n\n==Sounds/Phonology==\nThe phonemic inventory has 27 consonants, which includes aspirated, plain, and ejective stops. In addition to this, it has five [[oral vowels]] and three [[nasal vowels]]. It is a structure-preserving language. Assiniboine has no definite or indefinite articles, no nominal case system, and no verbal tense marking. Clauses unmarked are \"realized,\" while clauses marked as \"potential\" by means of verbal enclitic, which is successful in producing a future/non-future distinction.

Elements order might be different from the canonical SOV, this is not free nor scrambling word order, but instead, the result of topicalization or other movements. Out of context sentences are always interpreted as SOV order even if it sounds odd. For example, 'the man bit the dog', unless an element is moved into a focus\nposition. Focused element sentences are highly marked, and practically, a strange semantic reading is preferred over an interpretation of OSV. For example, the following sentence was interpreted as 'A banana ate the boy' by a native speaker, and to get the OSV reading out of it the object must be stressed, for example if the sentence was given as a reply to the question 'What did the boy eat?'.{{sfn|West|2003|pp=48\u201349}} \n:{{interlinear|lang=asb\n|\u0161k\u00f3\u0161kobena w\u00e3\u017ei hok\u0161\u00edna \u017ee y\u00fada.\n|banana a boy DET ate \n|'A banana ate the boy.'

[[Suzanne Somers]], [[Kathleen Quinlan]], [[Debralee Scott]] and [[Joe Spano]] also appear in the film.\n\nSet in [[Modesto, California]], in 1962, the film is a study of the [[cruising (driving)|cruising]] and early [[rock and roll|rock 'n' roll]] cultures popular among Lucas's age group at the time. Through a series of [[vignette (literature)|vignettes]], the film tells the story of a group of teenagers and their adventures over the course of a single night.\n\nThe genesis of ''American Graffiti'' was in Lucas' own teenage years in early 1960s Modesto. He was unsuccessful in [[pitch (filmmaking)|pitching]] the concept to financiers and distributors, but found favor at [[Universal Pictures]] after every other major film studio turned him down. Filming was initially set to take place in [[San Rafael, California]], but the production crew was denied permission to shoot beyond a second day. As a result, production was moved to [[Petaluma, California|Petaluma]].\n\n''American Graffiti'' premiered on August 2, 1973, at the [[Locarno International Film Festival]] in Switzerland, and was released on August 11, 1973, in the United States. The film received widespread critical acclaim and was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]].<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhRG1OzbDJs The Sting Wins Best Picture: 1974 Oscars]</ref> Produced on a $777,000 budget,<ref name=\"boxoffice\" /> it has become one of the most profitable films of all time. Since its initial release, ''American Graffiti'' has garnered an estimated return of well over $200 million in box office gross and home video sales, not including merchandising. In 1995 the United States [[Library of Congress]] deemed the film \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" and selected it for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]]. A sequel, ''[[More American Graffiti]]'', was released in 1979.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be set between 400-700 words. -->\nOn their the last evening of [[summer vacation]] in August 1962, recent high school graduates and longtime friends Curt Henderson and Steve Bolander meet two other friends, John Milner, the drag-racing king of the town, and Terry \"The Toad\" Fields, in the parking lot of the local [[Mel's Drive-In]] in [[Modesto, California]]. Curt and Steve are scheduled to travel \"[[Northeastern United States|Back East]]\" the following morning to start college. Despite receiving a $2,000 scholarship from the local [[Loyal Order of Moose|Moose Lodge]], Curt has second thoughts about leaving Modesto. Steve gives Terry his 1958 [[Chevrolet Impala]] to care for until he returns at Christmas. Steve's girlfriend, Laurie, who is also Curt's sister, arrives in her car. Steve suggests to Laurie, who is already glum about him going to college, that they see other people while he is away in order to \"strengthen\" their relationship. Though not openly upset, she is displeased, which affects their interactions the rest of the evening.\n\nCurt accompanies Steve, last year's high school student [[class president]], and Laurie, the current head cheerleader, to the [[First day of school|back-to-high-school]] [[sock hop]]. En route to the dance, Curt sees a beautiful blonde woman driving a white 1956 [[Ford Thunderbird]]: at a stoplight, she mouths the words \"I love you\" before disappearing around a corner. Curt becomes desperate to find her; one of his friends tells him \"The Blonde\" is the [[trophy wife]] of a local jeweler, but Curt doesn't believe it. After leaving the hop, Curt is coerced by a group of [[greaser (subculture)|greasers]] (\"The Pharaohs\") into participating in an initiation rite that involves hooking a chain to a police car and ripping out its back axle. The Pharaohs tell Curt that \"The Blonde\" is a prostitute, but he refuses to accept that as true.\n\nDetermined to get a message to the blonde woman, Curt drives to the radio station to ask the disc jockey \"[[Wolfman Jack]]\", who is omnipresent on the car radios, to read an on air message for her. Inside the station, Curt encounters an employee manning a console of record and cassette players, who tells him The Wolfman doesn't work at the station, and that the shows are pre-taped for replay at multiple stations. The employee accepts the message from Curt and promises to try to have The Wolfman air it. As he's leaving the station, Curt sees the employee talking into the microphone and hears the voice of The Wolfman on the air, so Curt realizes that despite the employee's earlier denials, he really is The Wolfman.\n\nThe Wolfman reads the message for The Blonde, which asks her to meet Curt at Mel's or call him at the phone booth outside. Curt is awakened by the phone's ringing early the next morning. \"The Blonde\" doesn't reveal her identity but says she knows Curt and maybe they'll meet that night if he sees her cruising on her usual street. Curt replies probably not, intimating that he has decided to go to college after all.\n\nTerry in Steve's car, and John in his yellow [[1932 Ford]] Deuce Coup\u00e9 hot rod [[Cruising (driving)|cruise]] the strip of Modesto. Terry, who is normally socially inept, picks up a flirtatious and somewhat rebellious girl named Debbie. John inadvertently picks up Carol, an annoying, precocious 12-year-old who manipulates him into driving her around all night. Another drag racer, the arrogant Bob Falfa, is searching out John in order to challenge him to a race.\n\nSteve and Laurie have a series of arguments and make-ups through the evening. They finally split and as the story lines intertwine, Bob Falfa picks up Laurie in his black [[1955 Chevrolet]] One-Fifty Coup\u00e9. Bob finally finds John and goads him into racing. A parade of cars follows them to \"Paradise Road\" to watch. As Bob takes the lead, a tire blows out and causes him to lose control. His car plunges into a ditch and rolls over. Steve and John leap out of their cars and rush to the wreck while a dazed Bob and Laurie crawl out and stagger away just before it explodes. Distraught, Laurie grips Steve tightly and begs him not to leave her. He assures her that he will stay in Modesto.\n\nAt the airfield later that morning, Curt says goodbye to his parents, Laurie, Steve, John and Terry. As the plane takes off, Curt gazes out the window and sees the white Thunderbird driving in parallel to his plane's flight path.\n\nAn on-screen epilogue reveals that John is killed by a drunk driver in December 1964, Terry is reported [[missing in action]] near [[An L\u1ed9c, B\u00ecnh Ph\u01b0\u1edbc|An L\u1ed9c]] in December [[1965 in the Vietnam War|1965]], Steve is an insurance agent in Modesto and Curt is a writer living in Canada, presumably to [[Draft dodging|avoid the draft]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Richard Dreyfuss]] as Curt Henderson\n* [[Ron Howard|Ronny Howard]] as Steve Bolander\n* [[Paul Le Mat]] as John Milner\n* [[Charles Martin Smith]] as Terry \"The Toad\" Fields\n* [[Cindy Williams]] as Laurie Henderson\n* [[Candy Clark]] as Debbie Dunham\n* [[Mackenzie Phillips]] as Carol Morrison\n* [[Wolfman Jack]] as Disc Jockey\n* [[Bo Hopkins]] as Joe Young\n* [[Manuel Padilla, Jr.]] as Carlos\n* [[Harrison Ford]] as Bob Falfa\n* [[Lynne Marie Stewart]] as Bobbie Tucker\n* [[Terry McGovern (actor)|Terry McGovern]] as [[Wolfman Jack|Mr. Wolfe]]\n* [[Kathleen Quinlan]] as Peg\n* [[Scott Beach]] as Mr. Gordon\n* [[Susan Richardson]] as Judy\n* [[Kay Lenz|Kay Ann Kemper]] as Jane\n* [[Joe Spano]] as Vic\n* [[Debralee Scott]] as Falfa's Girl\n* [[Suzanne Somers]] as \"The Blonde\" in the T-Bird\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Development==\n===Inspiration===\nDuring the production of ''[[THX 1138]]'' (1971), producer [[Francis Ford Coppola]] challenged co-writer/director [[George Lucas]] to write a script that would appeal to mainstream audiences.<ref name=first/> Lucas embraced the idea, using his early 1960s teenage experiences [[cruising (driving)|cruising]] in [[Modesto, California]]. \"Cruising was gone, and I felt compelled to document the whole experience and what [[Silent Generation|my generation]] used as a way of meeting girls,\" Lucas explained.<ref name=first/> As he developed the story in his mind, Lucas included his fascination with Wolfman Jack. Lucas had considered doing a documentary about the Wolfman when he attended the [[USC School of Cinematic Arts]], but he ultimately dropped the idea.<ref name=Whatev>Baxter, pp. 70, 104, 148, 254</ref>\n\nAdding in semiautobiographical connotations, Lucas set the story in his hometown of 1962 Modesto.<ref name=first/> The characters Curt Henderson, John Milner and Terry \"The Toad\" Fields also represent different stages from his younger life. Curt is modeled after Lucas's personality during USC, while Milner is based on Lucas's teenage [[street racing|street-racing]] and junior college years, and [[hot rod]] enthusiasts he had known from the [[Kustom Kulture]] in Modesto. Toad represents Lucas's [[nerd]] years as a freshman in high school, specifically his \"bad luck\" with dating.<ref name=personal/> The filmmaker was also inspired by [[Federico Fellini]]'s ''[[I Vitelloni]]'' (1953).<ref name=York>Baxter, pp. 106\u2013118</ref>\n\nAfter the financial failure of ''THX 1138'', Lucas wanted the film to act as a release for a world-weary audience:<ref name=Sturhahn>Sturhahn, Larry (March 1974). \"The Filming of ''American Graffiti''\".

So I made a film where, essentially, we can get rid of some of those frustrations, the feeling that everything seems futile.<ref name=Sturhahn/>}}\n\n===United Artists===\nAfter [[Warner Bros.]] abandoned Lucas's early version of ''[[Apocalypse Now]]'' (during the post-production of ''THX 1138''), the filmmaker decided to continue developing ''Another Quiet Night in Modesto'', eventually changing its title to ''American Graffiti''.<ref name=\"Whatev\"/> To co-write a 15-page [[film treatment]], Lucas hired [[Willard Huyck]] and [[Gloria Katz]], who also added semiautobiographical material to the story.<ref name=DVD>(DVD) ''The Making of American Graffiti''.

The potential financiers were concerned that [[music licensing]] costs would cause the film to go way over budget. Along with ''[[Easy Rider]]'' (1969), ''American Graffiti'' was one of the first films to eschew a traditional [[film score]] and successfully rely instead on synchronizing a series of popular hit songs with individual scenes.<ref name=Kurtz>{{cite news|author=Ken Plume |url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/376/376873p1.html |title=An Interview with Gary Kurtz |work=[[IGN]] |date=November 11, 2002 |accessdate=April 30, 2009}}</ref>\n\n''THX 1138'' was released in March 1971,<ref name=first>Hearn, pp. 10\u201311, 42\u201347</ref> and Lucas was offered opportunities to direct ''[[Lady Ice]]'', ''[[Tommy (1975 film)|Tommy]]'', or ''[[Hair (film)|Hair]]''. He turned down those offers, determined to pursue his own projects despite his urgent desire to find another film to direct.<ref name=pain/><ref name=sound/> During this time, Lucas conceived the idea for a [[space opera]] (as yet untitled) which later became the basis for his ''[[Star Wars]]'' franchise. At the [[1971 Cannes Film Festival]], ''THX'' was chosen for the [[Directors' Fortnight]] competition. There, Lucas met [[David Picker]], then president of [[United Artists]], who was intrigued by ''American Graffiti'' and Lucas' space opera. Picker decided to give Lucas $10,000 to develop ''Graffiti'' as a screenplay.<ref name=pain/>\n\nLucas planned to spend another five weeks in Europe and hoped that Huyck and Katz would agree to finish the screenplay by the time he returned, but they were about to start on their own film, ''[[Messiah of Evil]]'',<ref name=DVD/> so Lucas hired [[Richard Walter (screenwriter)|Richard Walter]], a colleague from the [[USC School of Cinematic Arts]] for the job. Walter was flattered but initially tried to sell Lucas on a different screenplay called ''Barry and the Persuasions'', a story of [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] teenagers in the late 1950s. Lucas held firm\u2014his was a story about [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] teenagers in the early 1960s. Walter was paid the $10,000, and he began to expand the Lucas/Huyck/Katz treatment into a screenplay.<ref name=pain/>\n\nLucas was dismayed when he returned to America in June 1971 and read Walter's script, which was written in the style and tone of an [[exploitation film]], similar to 1967's ''[[Hot Rods to Hell]]''. \"It was overtly sexual and very fantasy-like, with [[chicken (game)|playing chicken]] and things that kids didn't really do,\" Lucas explained. \"I wanted something that was more like the way I grew up.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.achievement.org/autodoc/page/luc0int-1 |title=A Life Making Movies |author=Staff |work=Academy of Achievement |date=June 19, 1999 |accessdate=April 22, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509145340/http://www.achievement.org/autodoc/page/luc0int-1 |archivedate=May 9, 2008 |url-status = dead}}</ref> Walter's script also had Steve and Laurie going to Nevada to get married without their parents' permission.<ref name=York/> Walter rewrote the screenplay, but Lucas nevertheless fired him due to their creative differences.<ref name=pain/>\n\nAfter paying Walter, Lucas had exhausted his development fund from United Artists. He began writing a script, completing his first draft in just three weeks. Drawing upon his large collection of vintage records, Lucas wrote each scene with a particular song in mind as its musical backdrop.<ref name=pain>Hearn, pp. 52\u201353</ref> The cost of licensing the 75 songs Lucas wanted was one factor in United Artists' ultimate decision to reject the script; the studio also felt it was too experimental\u2014\"a musical montage with no characters\". United Artists also passed on ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'', which Lucas shelved for the time being.<ref name=sound/>\n\n===Universal Pictures===\nLucas spent the rest of 1971 and early 1972 trying to raise financing for the ''American Graffiti'' script.<ref name=sound>Hearn, pp. 54\u201355</ref> During this time, [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], [[Paramount Pictures]], [[20th Century Fox]], and [[Columbia Pictures]] all turned down the opportunity to co-finance and distribute the film.<ref name=\"drugs\" /> Lucas, Huyck and Katz rewrote the second draft together, which, in addition to Modesto, was also set in [[Mill Valley, California|Mill Valley]] and [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]]. Lucas also intended to end ''American Graffiti'' showing a title card detailing the fate of the characters, including the death of Milner and the disappearance of Toad in Vietnam. Huyck and Katz found the ending depressing and were incredulous that Lucas planned to include only the male characters. Lucas argued that mentioning the girls meant adding another title card, which he felt would prolong the ending. Because of this, [[Pauline Kael]] later accused Lucas of [[chauvinism]].<ref name=drugs/>\n\nLucas and producer Gary Kurtz took the script to [[American International Pictures]], who expressed interest, but ultimately believed ''American Graffiti'' was not violent or sexual enough for the studio's standards.<ref name=accept>Baxter, pp. 120\u2013123</ref> Lucas and Kurtz eventually found favor at [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]], who allowed Lucas total [[artistic control]] and the right of [[final cut privilege]] on the condition that he make ''American Graffiti'' on a strict low budget.<ref name=sound/> This forced Lucas to drop the opening scene in which the Blonde Angel, Curt's image of the perfect woman, drives through an empty drive-in cinema in her Ford Thunderbird, her transparency revealing she does not exist.<ref name=change/>\n\nUniversal initially projected a $600,000 budget but added an additional $175,000 once producer [[Francis Ford Coppola]] signed on. This would allow the studio to advertise ''American Graffiti'' as \"from the man who gave you ''[[The Godfather]]'' (1972)\". However, Lucas was forced to concede final-cut privilege. The proposition also gave Universal [[first-look deal|first-look deals]] on Lucas' next two planned projects, ''Star Wars'' and ''[[Radioland Murders]]''.<ref name=accept/> As he continued to work on the script, Lucas encountered difficulties on the Steve and Laurie storyline. Lucas, Katz, and Huyck worked on the third draft together, specifically on the scenes featuring Steve and Laurie.<ref name=title/>\n\nProduction proceeded with virtually no input or interference from Universal since ''American Graffiti'' was a [[low-budget film]], and executive [[Ned Tanen]] had only modest expectations of its commercial success. However, Universal did object to the film's title, not knowing what \"American Graffiti\" meant;<ref name=title/> Lucas was dismayed when some executives assumed he was making an Italian movie about feet.<ref name=drugs/> The studio, therefore, submitted a long list of over 60 alternative titles, with their favorite being ''Another Slow Night in Modesto''<ref name=title/> and Coppola's ''Rock Around the Block''.<ref name=drugs/> They pushed hard to get Lucas to adopt any of the titles, but he was displeased with all the alternatives and persuaded Tanen to keep ''American Graffiti''.<ref name=title>Hearn, pp. 58\u201360</ref>\n\n==Production==\n===Casting===\nThe film's lengthy casting process was overseen by [[Fred Roos]], who worked with producer Francis Ford Coppola on ''The Godfather''.<ref name=DVD/> Because ''American Graffiti'''s main cast was for younger actors, the casting call and notices went through numerous high school drama groups and community theaters in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]].<ref name=personal/> Among the actors was [[Mark Hamill]], the future [[Luke Skywalker]] in Lucas' ''Star Wars'' trilogy.<ref name=change/>\n\nOver 100 unknown actors auditioned for Curt Henderson before [[Richard Dreyfuss]] was cast; George Lucas was impressed with Dreyfuss' thoughtful analysis of the role,<ref name=personal/> and, as a result, offered the actor his choice of Curt or Terry \"The Toad\" Fields.<ref name=change/> Roos, a former casting director on ''[[The Andy Griffith Show]]'', suggested [[Ron Howard]] for Steve Bolander; Howard accepted the role to break out of the mold of his career as a child actor.<ref name=personal>Hearn, pp. 56\u201357</ref> Howard would later appear in the very similar role of [[Richie Cunningham]] on the ''[[Happy Days]]'' sitcom.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cj5LfIhSaoIC&pg=PA184|title=Last Season of Innocence: The Teen Experience in the 1960s By Victor Brooks|quote=Happy Days began airing only a few months after Graffiti came out, and much of the plotline revolved around Howard's character, Richie Cunningham, who was almost an exact clone of Steve in the film.|isbn=9781442209176|last1=Brooks|first1=Victor|year=2012}}</ref> [[Bob Balaban]] turned down Terry out of fear of becoming typecast, a decision he later regretted.

Producer Francis Ford Coppola encouraged Lucas to cast [[Wolfman Jack]] as himself in a [[cameo appearance]]. \"George Lucas and I went through thousands of Wolfman Jack phone calls that were taped with the public,\" Jack reflected. \"The telephone calls [heard on the broadcasts] in the motion picture and on the soundtrack were actual calls with real people.\"<ref name=title/>\n\n===Filming===\nAlthough ''American Graffiti'' is set in 1962 [[Modesto, California]], Lucas believed the city had changed too much in 10 years and initially chose [[San Rafael, California|San Rafael]] as the primary shooting location.<ref name=change/> Filming began on June 26, 1972. However, Lucas soon became frustrated at the time it was taking to fix camera mounts to the cars.<ref name=Wex/> A key member of the production had also been arrested for growing marijuana,<ref name=drugs>Pollock, pp. 105\u2013111</ref> and in addition to already running behind the [[shooting schedule]], the San Rafael City Council immediately became concerned about the disruption that filming caused for local businesses and therefore withdrew permission to shoot beyond a second day.<ref name=Wex/>\n\n[[Petaluma, California|Petaluma]], a similarly small town approximately {{convert|20|mi}} north of San Rafael, was more cooperative, and ''American Graffiti'' moved there without the loss of a single day of shooting. Lucas convinced the San Rafael City Council to allow two further nights of filming for general cruising shots, which he used to evoke as much of the intended location as possible in the finished film. Shooting in Petaluma began June 28 and proceeded at a quick pace.<ref name=Wex/> Lucas mimicked the filmmaking style of [[B movie|B-movie]] producer [[Sam Katzman]] (''[[Rock Around the Clock (film)|Rock Around the Clock]]'' and ''[[Your Cheatin' Heart (film)|Your Cheatin' Heart]]'') in attempting to save money and authenticated low-budget filming methods.<ref name=change/>\n\nIn addition to Petaluma, other locations included [[Mel's Drive-In]] in San Francisco, [[Sonoma, California|Sonoma]], [[Richmond, California|Richmond]], [[Novato, California|Novato]], and the [[Buchanan Field Airport]] in [[Concord, California|Concord]].<ref name=San/> The freshman hop dance was filmed in the Gus Gymnasium, previously known as the Boys Gym, at [[Tamalpais High School]] in [[Mill Valley, California|Mill Valley]].<ref name=locations/>\n\nMore problems ensued during filming: Paul Le Mat was sent to the hospital after an allergic reaction to walnuts.

He believed that Techniscope, an inexpensive way of shooting on [[35mm movie film|35mm film]] and utilizing only half of the film's frame, would give a perfect widescreen format resembling [[16 mm film|16mm]]. Adding to the documentary feel was Lucas's openness for the cast to [[improvisation|improvise]] scenes. He also used [[goof]]s for the final cut, notably Charles Martin Smith's arriving on his scooter to meet Steve outside Mel's Drive-In.<ref name=Verna/> [[Jan D'Alquen and Ron Eveslage]] were hired as the cinematographers, but filming with Techniscope cameras brought lighting problems. As a result, Lucas commissioned help from friend [[Haskell Wexler]], who was credited as the \"visual consultant\".<ref name=Wex>Hearn, pp. 61\u201363</ref>\n\n===Editing===\nLucas had wanted his wife, [[Marcia Lucas|Marcia]], to edit ''American Graffiti'', but Universal executive Ned Tanen insisted on hiring [[Verna Fields]], who had just finished editing [[Steven Spielberg]]'s ''[[The Sugarland Express]]''.<ref>Baxter, pp. 132\u2013135.</ref> Fields worked on the first [[rough cut]] of the film before she left to resume work on ''[[What's Up, Doc? (1972 film)|What's Up, Doc?]]'' After Fields' departure, Lucas struggled with editing the film's story structure. He had originally written the script so that the four (Curt, Steve, John, and Toad) storylines were always presented in the same sequence (an \"ABCD\" plot structure). The first cut of ''American Graffiti'' was three and a half hours long, and in order to whittle the film down to a more manageable two hours, many scenes had to be cut, shortened, or combined. As a result, the film's structure became increasingly loose and no longer adhered to Lucas's original \"ABCD\" presentation.<ref name=Verna/> Lucas completed his final cut of ''American Graffiti'', which ran 112 minutes, in December 1972.<ref name=Jesus/> [[Walter Murch]] assisted Lucas in post-production for [[audio mixing (film and television)|audio mixing]] and [[sound design]] purposes.<ref name=Verna>Hearn, pp. 64\u201366</ref> Murch suggested making Wolfman Jack's radio show the \"backbone\" of the film. \"The Wolfman was an ethereal presence in the lives of young people,\" said producer Gary Kurtz, \"and it was that quality we wanted and obtained in the picture.\"<ref name=\"Marcia\">Baxter, pp. 129\u2013135.</ref>\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Main|41 Original Hits from the Soundtrack of American Graffiti}}\nThe choice of music was crucial to the mood of each scene - it is [[diegetic music]] that the characters themselves can hear and therefore becomes an integral part of the action.<ref>[https://www.filmmusicnotes.com/diegetic-music-non-diegetic-music-and-source-scoring/ Richards, Mark. 'Diegetic Music, Non-Diegetic Music, and \u201cSource Scoring\u201d' in ''Film Music Notes'', 21 April 2013]</ref> But George Lucas had to be realistic about the complexities of copyright clearances and suggested a number of alternative tracks. Universal wanted Lucas and producer Gary Kurtz to hire an orchestra for [[sound-alike]]s. The studio eventually proposed a flat deal that offered every music publisher the same amount of money. This was acceptable to most of the companies representing Lucas' first choices, but not to [[RCA]]\u2014with the consequence that [[Elvis Presley]] is conspicuously absent from the soundtrack.<ref name=sound/> Clearing the [[music licensing]] rights had cost approximately $90,000,<ref name=Marcia /> and as a result, there was no money left for a traditional [[film score]]. \"I used the absence of music, and sound effects, to create the drama,\" Lucas later explained.<ref name=Jesus/>\n\nA [[soundtrack album]] for the film, ''[[41 Original Hits from the Soundtrack of American Graffiti]]'', was issued by [[MCA Records]]. The album contains all the songs used in the film (with the exception of \"Gee\" by the Crows, which was subsequently included on a second soundtrack album), presented in the order in which they appeared in the film.\n\n==Reception==\n===Release===\nDespite unanimous praise at a January 1973 [[test screening]] attended by Universal executive [[Ned Tanen]], the studio told Lucas they wanted to re-edit his original cut of ''American Graffiti''.<ref name=Jesus>Hearn, pp. 67\u201369</ref> Producer Coppola sided with Lucas against Tanen and Universal, offering to \"buy the film\" from the studio and reimburse it for the $775,000 (equivalent to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|0.775|1972|r=1}}}}&nbsp;million in {{Inflation-year|US}}){{Inflation-fn|US}} it had cost to make it.<ref name=San/> [[20th Century Fox]] and [[Paramount Pictures]] made similar offers to the studio.<ref name=Whatev/> Universal refused these offers and told Lucas they planned to have [[William Hornbeck]] re-edit the film.<ref name=France/>\n\nWhen Coppola's ''[[The Godfather]]'' won the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]] in March 1973, Universal relented and agreed to cut only three scenes (about four minutes) from Lucas' cut\u2014an encounter between Toad and a fast-talking car salesman, an argument between Steve and his former teacher Mr. Kroot at the sock hop, and an effort by Bob Falfa to serenade Laurie with \"[[Some Enchanted Evening (song)|Some Enchanted Evening]]\"\u2014but decided that the film was fit for release only as a [[television movie]].<ref name=San/>\n\nHowever, various studio employees who had seen the film began talking it up, and its reputation grew through [[word of mouth]].<ref name=San/> The studio dropped the TV movie idea and began arranging for a [[limited release]] in selected theaters in Los Angeles and New York.<ref name=Kurtz/> Universal presidents [[Sidney Sheinberg]] and [[Lew Wasserman]] heard about the praise the film had been garnering in L.A and New York, and the marketing department amped up its promotion strategy for it,<ref name=Kurtz/> investing an additional $500,000 (equivalent to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|0.5|1973|r=1}}}}&nbsp;million in {{Inflation-year|US}}){{Inflation-fn|US}} in marketing and promotion.<ref name=Whatev/> The film was released in the United States on August 11, 1973<ref name=\"boxoffice\"/> to [[sleeper hit]] reception.<ref name=box/> The film had cost only $1.27 million (equivalent to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|1.27|1972|r=1}}}}&nbsp;million in {{Inflation-year|US}}){{Inflation-fn|US}} to produce and market, but yielded worldwide [[box office]] gross revenues of more than $55 million (equivalent to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|55|1973|r=0}}}}&nbsp;million in {{Inflation-year|US}}){{Inflation-fn|US}}.<ref name=radio/> It had only modest success outside the United States, but became a [[cult film]] in France.<ref name=France/>\n\nUniversal reissued ''Graffiti'' in 1978 and earned an additional $63 million (equivalent to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|63|1978|r=0}}}}&nbsp;million in {{Inflation-year|US}}),{{Inflation-fn|US}} which brought the total revenue for the two releases to $118 million (equivalent to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|118|1978|r=0}}}}&nbsp;million in {{Inflation-year|US}}){{Inflation-fn|US}}.<ref name=Whatev/> The reissue included [[stereophonic sound]]<ref name=radio/> and the additional four minutes the studio had removed from Lucas' original cut.

[[Suzanne Somers]], [[Kathleen Quinlan]], [[Debralee Scott]] and [[Joe Spano]] also appear in the film.\n\nSet in [[Modesto, California]], in 1962, the film is a study of the [[cruising (driving)|cruising]] and early [[rock and roll|rock 'n' roll]] cultures popular among Lucas's age group at the time. Through a series of [[vignette (literature)|vignettes]], the film tells the story of a group of teenagers and their adventures over the course of a single night.\n\nThe genesis of ''American Graffiti'' was in Lucas' own teenage years in early 1960s Modesto. He was unsuccessful in [[pitch (filmmaking)|pitching]] the concept to financiers and distributors, but found favor at [[Universal Pictures]] after every other major film studio turned him down. Filming was initially set to take place in [[San Rafael, California]], but the production crew was denied permission to shoot beyond a second day. As a result, production was moved to [[Petaluma, California|Petaluma]].\n\n''American Graffiti'' premiered on August 2, 1973, at the [[Locarno International Film Festival]] in Switzerland, and was released on August 11, 1973, in the United States. The film received widespread critical acclaim and was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]].<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhRG1OzbDJs The Sting Wins Best Picture: 1974 Oscars]</ref> Produced on a $777,000 budget,<ref name=\"boxoffice\" /> it has become one of the most profitable films of all time. Since its initial release, ''American Graffiti'' has garnered an estimated return of well over $200 million in box office gross and home video sales, not including merchandising. In 1995 the United States [[Library of Congress]] deemed the film \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" and selected it for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]]. A sequel, ''[[More American Graffiti]]'', was released in 1979.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be set between 400-700 words. -->\nOn their the last evening of [[summer vacation]] in August 1962, recent high school graduates and longtime friends Curt Henderson and Steve Bolander meet two other friends, John Milner, the drag-racing king of the town, and Terry \"The Toad\" Fields, in the parking lot of the local [[Mel's Drive-In]] in [[Modesto, California]]. Curt and Steve are scheduled to travel \"[[Northeastern United States|Back East]]\" the following morning to start college. Despite receiving a $2,000 scholarship from the local [[Loyal Order of Moose|Moose Lodge]], Curt has second thoughts about leaving Modesto. Steve gives Terry his 1958 [[Chevrolet Impala]] to care for until he returns at Christmas. Steve's girlfriend, Laurie, who is also Curt's sister, arrives in her car. Steve suggests to Laurie, who is already glum about him going to college, that they see other people while he is away in order to \"strengthen\" their relationship. Though not openly upset, she is displeased, which affects their interactions the rest of the evening.\n\nCurt accompanies Steve, last year's high school student [[class president]], and Laurie, the current head cheerleader, to the [[First day of school|back-to-high-school]] [[sock hop]]. En route to the dance, Curt sees a beautiful blonde woman driving a white 1956 [[Ford Thunderbird]]: at a stoplight, she mouths the words \"I love you\" before disappearing around a corner. Curt becomes desperate to find her; one of his friends tells him \"The Blonde\" is the [[trophy wife]] of a local jeweler, but Curt doesn't believe it. After leaving the hop, Curt is coerced by a group of [[greaser (subculture)|greasers]] (\"The Pharaohs\") into participating in an initiation rite that involves hooking a chain to a police car and ripping out its back axle. The Pharaohs tell Curt that \"The Blonde\" is a prostitute, but he refuses to accept that as true.\n\nDetermined to get a message to the blonde woman, Curt drives to the radio station to ask the disc jockey \"[[Wolfman Jack]]\", who is omnipresent on the car radios, to read an on air message for her. Inside the station, Curt encounters an employee manning a console of record and cassette players, who tells him The Wolfman doesn't work at the station, and that the shows are pre-taped for replay at multiple stations. The employee accepts the message from Curt and promises to try to have The Wolfman air it. As he's leaving the station, Curt sees the employee talking into the microphone and hears the voice of The Wolfman on the air, so Curt realizes that despite the employee's earlier denials, he really is The Wolfman.\n\nThe Wolfman reads the message for The Blonde, which asks her to meet Curt at Mel's or call him at the phone booth outside. Curt is awakened by the phone's ringing early the next morning. \"The Blonde\" doesn't reveal her identity but says she knows Curt and maybe they'll meet that night if he sees her cruising on her usual street. Curt replies probably not, intimating that he has decided to go to college after all.\n\nTerry in Steve's car, and John in his yellow [[1932 Ford]] Deuce Coup\u00e9 hot rod [[Cruising (driving)|cruise]] the strip of Modesto. Terry, who is normally socially inept, picks up a flirtatious and somewhat rebellious girl named Debbie. John inadvertently picks up Carol, an annoying, precocious 12-year-old who manipulates him into driving her around all night. Another drag racer, the arrogant Bob Falfa, is searching out John in order to challenge him to a race.\n\nSteve and Laurie have a series of arguments and make-ups through the evening. They finally split and as the story lines intertwine, Bob Falfa picks up Laurie in his black [[1955 Chevrolet]] One-Fifty Coup\u00e9. Bob finally finds John and goads him into racing. A parade of cars follows them to \"Paradise Road\" to watch. As Bob takes the lead, a tire blows out and causes him to lose control. His car plunges into a ditch and rolls over. Steve and John leap out of their cars and rush to the wreck while a dazed Bob and Laurie crawl out and stagger away just before it explodes. Distraught, Laurie grips Steve tightly and begs him not to leave her. He assures her that he will stay in Modesto.\n\nAt the airfield later that morning, Curt says goodbye to his parents, Laurie, Steve, John and Terry. As the plane takes off, Curt gazes out the window and sees the white Thunderbird driving in parallel to his plane's flight path.\n\nAn on-screen epilogue reveals that John is killed by a drunk driver in December 1964, Terry is reported [[missing in action]] near [[An L\u1ed9c, B\u00ecnh Ph\u01b0\u1edbc|An L\u1ed9c]] in December [[1965 in the Vietnam War|1965]], Steve is an insurance agent in Modesto and Curt is a writer living in Canada, presumably to [[Draft dodging|avoid the draft]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Richard Dreyfuss]] as Curt Henderson\n* [[Ron Howard|Ronny Howard]] as Steve Bolander\n* [[Paul Le Mat]] as John Milner\n* [[Charles Martin Smith]] as Terry \"The Toad\" Fields\n* [[Cindy Williams]] as Laurie Henderson\n* [[Candy Clark]] as Debbie Dunham\n* [[Mackenzie Phillips]] as Carol Morrison\n* [[Wolfman Jack]] as Disc Jockey\n* [[Bo Hopkins]] as Joe Young\n* [[Manuel Padilla, Jr.]] as Carlos\n* [[Harrison Ford]] as Bob Falfa\n* [[Lynne Marie Stewart]] as Bobbie Tucker\n* [[Terry McGovern (actor)|Terry McGovern]] as [[Wolfman Jack|Mr. Wolfe]]\n* [[Kathleen Quinlan]] as Peg\n* [[Scott Beach]] as Mr. Gordon\n* [[Susan Richardson]] as Judy\n* [[Kay Lenz|Kay Ann Kemper]] as Jane\n* [[Joe Spano]] as Vic\n* [[Debralee Scott]] as Falfa's Girl\n* [[Suzanne Somers]] as \"The Blonde\" in the T-Bird\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Development==\n===Inspiration===\nDuring the production of ''[[THX 1138]]'' (1971), producer [[Francis Ford Coppola]] challenged co-writer/director [[George Lucas]] to write a script that would appeal to mainstream audiences.<ref name=first/> Lucas embraced the idea, using his early 1960s teenage experiences [[cruising (driving)|cruising]] in [[Modesto, California]]. \"Cruising was gone, and I felt compelled to document the whole experience and what [[Silent Generation|my generation]] used as a way of meeting girls,\" Lucas explained.<ref name=first/> As he developed the story in his mind, Lucas included his fascination with Wolfman Jack. Lucas had considered doing a documentary about the Wolfman when he attended the [[USC School of Cinematic Arts]], but he ultimately dropped the idea.<ref name=Whatev>Baxter, pp. 70, 104, 148, 254</ref>\n\nAdding in semiautobiographical connotations, Lucas set the story in his hometown of 1962 Modesto.<ref name=first/> The characters Curt Henderson, John Milner and Terry \"The Toad\" Fields also represent different stages from his younger life. Curt is modeled after Lucas's personality during USC, while Milner is based on Lucas's teenage [[street racing|street-racing]] and junior college years, and [[hot rod]] enthusiasts he had known from the [[Kustom Kulture]] in Modesto. Toad represents Lucas's [[nerd]] years as a freshman in high school, specifically his \"bad luck\" with dating.<ref name=personal/> The filmmaker was also inspired by [[Federico Fellini]]'s ''[[I Vitelloni]]'' (1953).<ref name=York>Baxter, pp. 106\u2013118</ref>\n\nAfter the financial failure of ''THX 1138'', Lucas wanted the film to act as a release for a world-weary audience:<ref name=Sturhahn>Sturhahn, Larry (March 1974). \"The Filming of ''American Graffiti''\".

So I made a film where, essentially, we can get rid of some of those frustrations, the feeling that everything seems futile.<ref name=Sturhahn/>}}\n\n===United Artists===\nAfter [[Warner Bros.]] abandoned Lucas's early version of ''[[Apocalypse Now]]'' (during the post-production of ''THX 1138''), the filmmaker decided to continue developing ''Another Quiet Night in Modesto'', eventually changing its title to ''American Graffiti''.<ref name=\"Whatev\"/> To co-write a 15-page [[film treatment]], Lucas hired [[Willard Huyck]] and [[Gloria Katz]], who also added semiautobiographical material to the story.<ref name=DVD>(DVD) ''The Making of American Graffiti''.

The potential financiers were concerned that [[music licensing]] costs would cause the film to go way over budget. Along with ''[[Easy Rider]]'' (1969), ''American Graffiti'' was one of the first films to eschew a traditional [[film score]] and successfully rely instead on synchronizing a series of popular hit songs with individual scenes.<ref name=Kurtz>{{cite news|author=Ken Plume |url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/376/376873p1.html |title=An Interview with Gary Kurtz |work=[[IGN]] |date=November 11, 2002 |accessdate=April 30, 2009}}</ref>\n\n''THX 1138'' was released in March 1971,<ref name=first>Hearn, pp. 10\u201311, 42\u201347</ref> and Lucas was offered opportunities to direct ''[[Lady Ice]]'', ''[[Tommy (1975 film)|Tommy]]'', or ''[[Hair (film)|Hair]]''. He turned down those offers, determined to pursue his own projects despite his urgent desire to find another film to direct.<ref name=pain/><ref name=sound/> During this time, Lucas conceived the idea for a [[space opera]] (as yet untitled) which later became the basis for his ''[[Star Wars]]'' franchise. At the [[1971 Cannes Film Festival]], ''THX'' was chosen for the [[Directors' Fortnight]] competition. There, Lucas met [[David Picker]], then president of [[United Artists]], who was intrigued by ''American Graffiti'' and Lucas' space opera. Picker decided to give Lucas $10,000 to develop ''Graffiti'' as a screenplay.<ref name=pain/>\n\nLucas planned to spend another five weeks in Europe and hoped that Huyck and Katz would agree to finish the screenplay by the time he returned, but they were about to start on their own film, ''[[Messiah of Evil]]'',<ref name=DVD/> so Lucas hired [[Richard Walter (screenwriter)|Richard Walter]], a colleague from the [[USC School of Cinematic Arts]] for the job. Walter was flattered but initially tried to sell Lucas on a different screenplay called ''Barry and the Persuasions'', a story of [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] teenagers in the late 1950s. Lucas held firm\u2014his was a story about [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] teenagers in the early 1960s. Walter was paid the $10,000, and he began to expand the Lucas/Huyck/Katz treatment into a screenplay.<ref name=pain/>\n\nLucas was dismayed when he returned to America in June 1971 and read Walter's script, which was written in the style and tone of an [[exploitation film]], similar to 1967's ''[[Hot Rods to Hell]]''. \"It was overtly sexual and very fantasy-like, with [[chicken (game)|playing chicken]] and things that kids didn't really do,\" Lucas explained. \"I wanted something that was more like the way I grew up.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.achievement.org/autodoc/page/luc0int-1 |title=A Life Making Movies |author=Staff |work=Academy of Achievement |date=June 19, 1999 |accessdate=April 22, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509145340/http://www.achievement.org/autodoc/page/luc0int-1 |archivedate=May 9, 2008 |url-status = dead}}</ref> Walter's script also had Steve and Laurie going to Nevada to get married without their parents' permission.<ref name=York/> Walter rewrote the screenplay, but Lucas nevertheless fired him due to their creative differences.<ref name=pain/>\n\nAfter paying Walter, Lucas had exhausted his development fund from United Artists. He began writing a script, completing his first draft in just three weeks. Drawing upon his large collection of vintage records, Lucas wrote each scene with a particular song in mind as its musical backdrop.<ref name=pain>Hearn, pp. 52\u201353</ref> The cost of licensing the 75 songs Lucas wanted was one factor in United Artists' ultimate decision to reject the script; the studio also felt it was too experimental\u2014\"a musical montage with no characters\". United Artists also passed on ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'', which Lucas shelved for the time being.<ref name=sound/>\n\n===Universal Pictures===\nLucas spent the rest of 1971 and early 1972 trying to raise financing for the ''American Graffiti'' script.<ref name=sound>Hearn, pp. 54\u201355</ref> During this time, [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], [[Paramount Pictures]], [[20th Century Fox]], and [[Columbia Pictures]] all turned down the opportunity to co-finance and distribute the film.<ref name=\"drugs\" /> Lucas, Huyck and Katz rewrote the second draft together, which, in addition to Modesto, was also set in [[Mill Valley, California|Mill Valley]] and [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]]. Lucas also intended to end ''American Graffiti'' showing a title card detailing the fate of the characters, including the death of Milner and the disappearance of Toad in Vietnam. Huyck and Katz found the ending depressing and were incredulous that Lucas planned to include only the male characters. Lucas argued that mentioning the girls meant adding another title card, which he felt would prolong the ending. Because of this, [[Pauline Kael]] later accused Lucas of [[chauvinism]].<ref name=drugs/>\n\nLucas and producer Gary Kurtz took the script to [[American International Pictures]], who expressed interest, but ultimately believed ''American Graffiti'' was not violent or sexual enough for the studio's standards.<ref name=accept>Baxter, pp. 120\u2013123</ref> Lucas and Kurtz eventually found favor at [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]], who allowed Lucas total [[artistic control]] and the right of [[final cut privilege]] on the condition that he make ''American Graffiti'' on a strict low budget.<ref name=sound/> This forced Lucas to drop the opening scene in which the Blonde Angel, Curt's image of the perfect woman, drives through an empty drive-in cinema in her Ford Thunderbird, her transparency revealing she does not exist.<ref name=change/>\n\nUniversal initially projected a $600,000 budget but added an additional $175,000 once producer [[Francis Ford Coppola]] signed on. This would allow the studio to advertise ''American Graffiti'' as \"from the man who gave you ''[[The Godfather]]'' (1972)\". However, Lucas was forced to concede final-cut privilege. The proposition also gave Universal [[first-look deal|first-look deals]] on Lucas' next two planned projects, ''Star Wars'' and ''[[Radioland Murders]]''.<ref name=accept/> As he continued to work on the script, Lucas encountered difficulties on the Steve and Laurie storyline. Lucas, Katz, and Huyck worked on the third draft together, specifically on the scenes featuring Steve and Laurie.<ref name=title/>\n\nProduction proceeded with virtually no input or interference from Universal since ''American Graffiti'' was a [[low-budget film]], and executive [[Ned Tanen]] had only modest expectations of its commercial success. However, Universal did object to the film's title, not knowing what \"American Graffiti\" meant;<ref name=title/> Lucas was dismayed when some executives assumed he was making an Italian movie about feet.<ref name=drugs/> The studio, therefore, submitted a long list of over 60 alternative titles, with their favorite being ''Another Slow Night in Modesto''<ref name=title/> and Coppola's ''Rock Around the Block''.<ref name=drugs/> They pushed hard to get Lucas to adopt any of the titles, but he was displeased with all the alternatives and persuaded Tanen to keep ''American Graffiti''.<ref name=title>Hearn, pp. 58\u201360</ref>\n\n==Production==\n===Casting===\nThe film's lengthy casting process was overseen by [[Fred Roos]], who worked with producer Francis Ford Coppola on ''The Godfather''.<ref name=DVD/> Because ''American Graffiti'''s main cast was for younger actors, the casting call and notices went through numerous high school drama groups and community theaters in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]].<ref name=personal/> Among the actors was [[Mark Hamill]], the future [[Luke Skywalker]] in Lucas' ''Star Wars'' trilogy.<ref name=change/>\n\nOver 100 unknown actors auditioned for Curt Henderson before [[Richard Dreyfuss]] was cast; George Lucas was impressed with Dreyfuss' thoughtful analysis of the role,<ref name=personal/> and, as a result, offered the actor his choice of Curt or Terry \"The Toad\" Fields.<ref name=change/> Roos, a former casting director on ''[[The Andy Griffith Show]]'', suggested [[Ron Howard]] for Steve Bolander; Howard accepted the role to break out of the mold of his career as a child actor.<ref name=personal>Hearn, pp. 56\u201357</ref> Howard would later appear in the very similar role of [[Richie Cunningham]] on the ''[[Happy Days]]'' sitcom.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cj5LfIhSaoIC&pg=PA184|title=Last Season of Innocence: The Teen Experience in the 1960s By Victor Brooks|quote=Happy Days began airing only a few months after Graffiti came out, and much of the plotline revolved around Howard's character, Richie Cunningham, who was almost an exact clone of Steve in the film.|isbn=9781442209176|last1=Brooks|first1=Victor|year=2012}}</ref> [[Bob Balaban]] turned down Terry out of fear of becoming typecast, a decision he later regretted.

Two cameras were used simultaneously in scenes involving conversations between actors in different cars, which resulted in significant production time savings.<ref name=Wex/> After [[CinemaScope]] proved to be too expensive,<ref name=change/> Lucas decided ''American Graffiti'' should have a [[documentary film|documentary]]-like feel, so he shot the film using [[Techniscope]] cameras. He believed that Techniscope, an inexpensive way of shooting on [[35mm movie film|35mm film]] and utilizing only half of the film's frame, would give a perfect widescreen format resembling [[16 mm film|16mm]]. Adding to the documentary feel was Lucas's openness for the cast to [[improvisation|improvise]] scenes. He also used [[goof]]s for the final cut, notably Charles Martin Smith's arriving on his scooter to meet Steve outside Mel's Drive-In.<ref name=Verna/> [[Jan D'Alquen and Ron Eveslage]] were hired as the cinematographers, but filming with Techniscope cameras brought lighting problems. As a result, Lucas commissioned help from friend [[Haskell Wexler]], who was credited as the \"visual consultant\".<ref name=Wex>Hearn, pp. 61\u201363</ref>\n\n===Editing===\nLucas had wanted his wife, [[Marcia Lucas|Marcia]], to edit ''American Graffiti'', but Universal executive Ned Tanen insisted on hiring [[Verna Fields]], who had just finished editing [[Steven Spielberg]]'s ''[[The Sugarland Express]]''.<ref>Baxter, pp. 132\u2013135.</ref> Fields worked on the first [[rough cut]] of the film before she left to resume work on ''[[What's Up, Doc? (1972 film)|What's Up, Doc?]]'' After Fields' departure, Lucas struggled with editing the film's story structure. He had originally written the script so that the four (Curt, Steve, John, and Toad) storylines were always presented in the same sequence (an \"ABCD\" plot structure). The first cut of ''American Graffiti'' was three and a half hours long, and in order to whittle the film down to a more manageable two hours, many scenes had to be cut, shortened, or combined. As a result, the film's structure became increasingly loose and no longer adhered to Lucas's original \"ABCD\" presentation.<ref name=Verna/> Lucas completed his final cut of ''American Graffiti'', which ran 112 minutes, in December 1972.<ref name=Jesus/> [[Walter Murch]] assisted Lucas in post-production for [[audio mixing (film and television)|audio mixing]] and [[sound design]] purposes.<ref name=Verna>Hearn, pp. 64\u201366</ref> Murch suggested making Wolfman Jack's radio show the \"backbone\" of the film. \"The Wolfman was an ethereal presence in the lives of young people,\" said producer Gary Kurtz, \"and it was that quality we wanted and obtained in the picture.\"<ref name=\"Marcia\">Baxter, pp. 129\u2013135.</ref>\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Main|41 Original Hits from the Soundtrack of American Graffiti}}\nThe choice of music was crucial to the mood of each scene - it is [[diegetic music]] that the characters themselves can hear and therefore becomes an integral part of the action. But George Lucas had to be realistic about the complexities of copyright clearances and suggested a number of alternative tracks. Universal wanted Lucas and producer Gary Kurtz to hire an orchestra for [[sound-alike]]s. The studio eventually proposed a flat deal that offered every music publisher the same amount of money. This was acceptable to most of the companies representing Lucas' first choices, but not to [[RCA]]\u2014with the consequence that [[Elvis Presley]] is conspicuously absent from the soundtrack.<ref name=sound/> Clearing the [[music licensing]] rights had cost approximately $90,000,<ref name=Marcia /> and as a result, there was no money left for a traditional [[film score]]. \"I used the absence of music, and sound effects, to create the drama,\" Lucas later explained.<ref name=Jesus/>\n\nA [[soundtrack album]] for the film, ''[[41 Original Hits from the Soundtrack of American Graffiti]]'', was issued by [[MCA Records]]. The album contains all the songs used in the film (with the exception of \"Gee\" by the Crows, which was subsequently included on a second soundtrack album), presented in the order in which they appeared in the film.\n\n==Reception==\n===Release===\nDespite unanimous praise at a January 1973 [[test screening]] attended by Universal executive [[Ned Tanen]], the studio told Lucas they wanted to re-edit his original cut of ''American Graffiti''.<ref name=Jesus>Hearn, pp. 67\u201369</ref> Producer Coppola sided with Lucas against Tanen and Universal, offering to \"buy the film\" from the studio and reimburse it for the $775,000 (equivalent to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|0.775|1972|r=1}}}}&nbsp;million in {{Inflation-year|US}}){{Inflation-fn|US}} it had cost to make it.<ref name=San/> [[20th Century Fox]] and [[Paramount Pictures]] made similar offers to the studio.<ref name=Whatev/> Universal refused these offers and told Lucas they planned to have [[William Hornbeck]] re-edit the film.<ref name=France/>\n\nWhen Coppola's ''[[The Godfather]]'' won the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]] in March 1973, Universal relented and agreed to cut only three scenes (about four minutes) from Lucas' cut\u2014an encounter between Toad and a fast-talking car salesman, an argument between Steve and his former teacher Mr. Kroot at the sock hop, and an effort by Bob Falfa to serenade Laurie with \"[[Some Enchanted Evening (song)|Some Enchanted Evening]]\"\u2014but decided that the film was fit for release only as a [[television movie]].<ref name=San/>\n\nHowever, various studio employees who had seen the film began talking it up, and its reputation grew through [[word of mouth]].<ref name=San/> The studio dropped the TV movie idea and began arranging for a [[limited release]] in selected theaters in Los Angeles and New York.<ref name=Kurtz/> Universal presidents [[Sidney Sheinberg]] and [[Lew Wasserman]] heard about the praise the film had been garnering in L.A and New York, and the marketing department amped up its promotion strategy for it,<ref name=Kurtz/> investing an additional $500,000 (equivalent to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|0.5|1973|r=1}}}}&nbsp;million in {{Inflation-year|US}}){{Inflation-fn|US}} in marketing and promotion.<ref name=Whatev/> The film was released in the United States on August 11, 1973<ref name=\"boxoffice\"/> to [[sleeper hit]] reception.<ref name=box/> The film had cost only $1.27 million (equivalent to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|1.27|1972|r=1}}}}&nbsp;million in {{Inflation-year|US}}){{Inflation-fn|US}} to produce and market, but yielded worldwide [[box office]] gross revenues of more than $55 million (equivalent to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|55|1973|r=0}}}}&nbsp;million in {{Inflation-year|US}}){{Inflation-fn|US}}.<ref name=radio/> It had only modest success outside the United States, but became a [[cult film]] in France.<ref name=France/>\n\nUniversal reissued ''Graffiti'' in 1978 and earned an additional $63 million (equivalent to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|63|1978|r=0}}}}&nbsp;million in {{Inflation-year|US}}),{{Inflation-fn|US}} which brought the total revenue for the two releases to $118 million (equivalent to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|118|1978|r=0}}}}&nbsp;million in {{Inflation-year|US}}){{Inflation-fn|US}}.<ref name=Whatev/> The reissue included [[stereophonic sound]]<ref name=radio/> and the additional four minutes the studio had removed from Lucas' original cut.
