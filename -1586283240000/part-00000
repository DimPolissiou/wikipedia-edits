They made a short experiment with an [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]]-style kit, light blue and white stripes with black shorts, after the [[1978 FIFA World Cup|1978 World Cup]]. This was abandoned after the outbreak of the [[Falklands War]],<ref name=\"Background\" /> and the club returned to blue and white striped tops with blue shorts in the 1980s.

It was still based on the [[Stockport]] coat of arms, though the ''Animo et Fide'' motto was removed, along with a patch of green at the base of the badge; the [[flag of Cheshire]], featuring a sword and three wheatsheaves, replaced the golden lozenges and crosslets in the shield. The medals hanging from the lion's rampant (which represented Cheshire and [[Lancashire]], owing to Stockport's location astride the Mersey which forms the historic border between the two counties) were removed. It also saw the return of a football on the shield. This change was made in part because as of the 2010\u201311 season, Stockport County was sponsored by the Metropolitan Borough Council.<ref name=\"Npower League Two 2010 - 2011 Kits\">{{cite web | url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/English_Football_League/season/2010-2011/league-two.html| title=Npower League Two 2010 \u2013 2011| work=Historical Kits | accessdate=9 September 2013|last=Moor|first=Dave|date=9 September 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe crest was altered in 2011 to re-include the town motto. The new version added two white ribbons \u2013 one at the top, with ''Animo et Fide'', and one at the bottom with ''Stockport County F.C.''. In addition, the football was again removed from the shield. The [[Stockport County Supporters' Co - Operative]] used the blue on white cross symbol from the 1978 badge as the main identifier in their company logo. County's kit was supplied by local manufacturer [[Umbro]] who supplied all three of County's kit for the 2013\u201314 season, replacing [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], thus making County the only senior club in

During the mid-1960s, the Football League introduced a minimum admission price for all clubs in all four divisions, attempting to help boost revenue for lower clubs. It had the desired effect only in small towns miles from big city teams. It had the opposite effect in larger places like Stockport, where lower-league clubs were in relatively close proximity to clubs in higher divisions. Stockport devised a solution, moving all their home games to Friday evening kick-offs, which generated larger crowds and extra business in surrounding pubs and restaurants. Still, during the [[1998\u201399 in English football|1998\u201399]] season, crowds averaged around 20,000 less than local rivals Manchester City, who were a division below Stockport at the time.<ref name=\"Archive : England 1998-1999\">{{cite web | url=http://www.european-football-statistics.co.uk/attn/archive/aveeng99.htm| title=Attendances \u2013 Archive : England 1998\u20131999| publisher=European Football Statistics | accessdate=15 April 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206133246/http://www.european-football-statistics.co.uk/attn/archive/aveeng99.htm |archivedate=6 February 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 2004, the club notably attracted a crowd of more than 20,000 for one of its tour matches in China.

The medals hanging from the lion's rampant (which represented Cheshire and [[Lancashire]], owing to Stockport's location astride the Mersey which forms the historic border between the two counties) were removed. It also saw the return of a football on the shield. This change was made in part because as of the 2010\u201311 season, Stockport County was sponsored by the Metropolitan Borough Council.<ref name=\"Npower League Two 2010 - 2011 Kits\">{{cite web | url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/English_Football_League/season/2010-2011/league-two.html| title=Npower League Two 2010 \u2013 2011| work=Historical Kits | accessdate=9 September 2013|last=Moor|first=Dave|date=9 September 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe crest was altered in 2011 to re-include the town motto.

In addition, the football was again removed from the shield.

During the mid-1960s, the Football League introduced a minimum admission price for all clubs in all four divisions, attempting to help boost revenue for lower clubs. It had the desired effect only in small towns miles from big city teams. It had the opposite effect in larger places like Stockport, where lower-league clubs were in relatively close proximity to clubs in higher divisions. Stockport devised a solution, moving all their home games to Friday evening kick-offs, which generated larger crowds and extra business in surrounding pubs and restaurants. Still, during the [[1998\u201399 in English football|1998\u201399]] season, crowds averaged around 20,000 less than local rivals Manchester City, who were a division below Stockport at the time.<ref name=\"Archive : England 1998-1999\">{{cite web | url=http://www.european-football-statistics.co.uk/attn/archive/aveeng99.htm| title=Attendances \u2013 Archive : England 1998\u20131999| publisher=European Football Statistics | accessdate=15 April 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206133246/http://www.european-football-statistics.co.uk/attn/archive/aveeng99.htm |archivedate=6 February 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 2004, the club notably attracted a crowd of more than 20,000 for one of its tour matches in China. Both Manchester United and Barcelona achieved less in their subsequent tour matches in the country in the same year.<ref name=\"Stockport County scores in China's business league\">{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/1462568/Stockport-County-scores-in-Chinas-business-league.html| title=Stockport County scores in China's business league| work=Telegraph|date=22 May 2004 |last=Spencer|first=Richard|accessdate=9 August 2015}}</ref> Stockport were watched by 22,000 in Yingkou against their then sister side Stockport Tiger Star whom they beat 4\u20130.

That game in particular attracted a large crowd as the town of Stockport supported its team at [[Edgeley Park]]. If Stockport had lost that particular game, they would have been relegated for the second successive season, and more significantly, would have been relegated from [[the Football League]] for the first time, an embarrassment as the team had competed continuously in [[the Football League]] since 1900.

During these games Stockport's away support outnumbering home supporters on a number of occasions. Stockport County had an average away attendance of over 900, the highest in the league.

The couple persistently worked hard for their money to ensure that their children had the upbringing and opportunities they themselves had missed out on. Hann and Bich were thrifty and by 2004 were financially stable enough to purchase a \"large\" house with a two-car garage on a residential street in [[Markham, Ontario|Markham]], a town with a large Asian population.<ref name=LauImmigrantDream/> Bich drove a [[Lexus ES 300]] and Hann drove a [[Mercedes-Benz C-Class (W203)]]. They had accumulated [[Canadian dollar|CAD$]]200,000 in savings.<ref name=Revenge/>\n\nJennifer's parents set many goals for their children and had extremely high expectations of them. Jennifer was made to take piano lessons at the age of four, as well as [[figure skating]] classes where she trained most days during the week. She had hopes of becoming an [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] figure skating champion until she tore a ligament in her knee. Jennifer attended [[Mary Ward Catholic Secondary School]] where she played the [[flute]] in the school band.<ref name=Revenge/> According to her high school friend Karen K. Ho, Hann was seen as \"the classic [[tiger parenting|tiger dad]],\" and Bich was \"his reluctant accomplice.\" The Pans picked Jennifer up when classes ended each day and monitored her extracurricular activities very closely. They never permitted her to date boys while attending high school, or to attend high school dances or [[prom]]s out of fear that these activities would distract her from her academic commitments. Jennifer was not permitted to attend any parties while her parents believed that she was attending university. At the age of 22, \"she had never gone to a club, been drunk, visited a friend's cottage or gone on vacation without her family.\"<ref name=Revenge/> Jennifer and her friends reportedly regarded this upbringing as restrictive and greatly oppressive.<ref name=Revenge/>\n\nDespite her parents' high expectations and the fact that Jennifer had received good grades in lower school, throughout high school her grades were somewhat average (in the 70% range) except for music. Multiple times, she forged [[report card]]s using false templates to show her parents that she had received straight As when she had not. When Jennifer failed calculus class in her senior year of high school, [[Ryerson University]] rescinded her early admission. As she could not bear to be perceived as a failure, she began to lie to those she knew, including her parents, and pretended she was attending university. Instead, she sat in caf\u00e9s, taught as a piano instructor and worked in a restaurant to earn money.

Hann and Bich soon became suspicious when they realized she did not have a hospital ID badge or uniform. On one occasion, Bich followed her daughter to \"work\" and quickly discovered her deception. In a state of shock, Hann wanted to throw Jennifer out of the house, but her mother persuaded him to allow her to stay. As she had not completed high school due to failing [[calculus]], she eventually began working to finish high school completely and was later encouraged by her parents to apply to university. She was, however, forbidden to contact Wong or to go anywhere except to her piano-teaching job. Nevertheless, she and Wong spoke clandestinely during this period.<ref name=Revenge/>\n\nBy the time that Jennifer was 24, Wong had grown weary of trying to pursue a relationship with her. As Jennifer was so daunted and restricted by her parents that she lived at home and only met him in secret, Wong began to date another young woman whom he soon fell in love with.<ref name=Revenge/> Pan quickly invented a new story and told Wong that a man had entered her house, showing what appeared to be a police badge. She then told him that several men had rushed in and [[gang-rape]]d her. After this, she insisted that a bullet was mailed to her, telling Wong that it was sent from his new girlfriend.<ref name=Revenge/>\n\n==Murder==\nIn Spring 2010, Pan was in contact with Andrew Montemayor, a high school friend who, she claims, had boasted in their high school years about robbing people at knife point, an assertion denied by Montemayor. Montemayor introduced her to Ricardo Duncan, a \"[[Goth subculture|goth]] kid\" whom Pan gave $1,500 to kill her father in the parking lot at his workplace. Duncan says that she once gave him $200 for a night out, but that he returned it, and that he rebuffed her when she asked him to kill her parents.<ref name=Revenge/>\n\nPan and Wong were back in contact at this time and according to the police, came up with a plan to hire a professional [[hitman]] for $10,000 to kill her parents, calculating that she would then inherit $500,000.

The couple persistently worked hard for their money to ensure that their children had the upbringing and opportunities they themselves had missed out on. Hann and Bich were thrifty and by 2004 were financially stable enough to purchase a \"large\" house with a two-car garage on a residential street in [[Markham, Ontario|Markham]], a town with a large Asian population.<ref name=LauImmigrantDream/> Bich drove a [[Lexus ES 300]] and Hann drove a [[Mercedes-Benz C-Class (W203)]]. They had accumulated [[Canadian dollar|CAD$]]200,000 in savings.<ref name=Revenge/>\n\nJennifer's parents set many goals for their children and had extremely high expectations of them. Jennifer was made to take piano lessons at the age of four, as well as [[figure skating]] classes where she trained most days during the week. She had hopes of becoming an [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] figure skating champion until she tore a ligament in her knee. Jennifer attended [[Mary Ward Catholic Secondary School]] where she played the [[flute]] in the school band.<ref name=Revenge/> According to her high school friend Karen K. Ho, Hann was seen as \"the classic [[tiger parenting|tiger dad]],\" and Bich was \"his reluctant accomplice.\" The Pans picked Jennifer up when classes ended each day and monitored her extracurricular activities very closely. They never permitted her to date boys while attending high school, or to attend high school dances or [[prom]]s out of fear that these activities would distract her from her academic commitments. Jennifer was not permitted to attend any parties while her parents believed that she was attending university. At the age of 22, \"she had never gone to a club, been drunk, visited a friend's cottage or gone on vacation without her family.\"<ref name=Revenge/> Jennifer and her friends reportedly regarded this upbringing as restrictive and greatly oppressive.<ref name=Revenge/>\n\nDespite her parents' high expectations and the fact that Jennifer had received good grades in lower school, throughout high school her grades were somewhat average (in the 70% range) except for music. Multiple times, she forged [[report card]]s using false templates to show her parents that she had received straight As when she had not. When Jennifer failed calculus class in her senior year of high school, [[Ryerson University]] rescinded her early admission. As she could not bear to be perceived as a failure, she began to lie to those she knew, including her parents, and pretended she was attending university. Instead, she sat in caf\u00e9s, taught as a piano instructor and worked in a restaurant to earn money. In order to maintain the charade, Jennifer told her parents she had won scholarships, later falsely claiming that she had accepted an offer into the pharmacology program at the [[University of Toronto]]. She went to the extent of purchasing second-hand textbooks and watching videos related to pharmacology in order to create notebooks full of purported class notes that she could show her parents. Jennifer also requested permission from her parents to stay near the campus with a friend throughout the week.<ref name=Revenge/>\n\nJennifer was actually staying with her boyfriend,<ref name=Revenge/> Daniel Chi-Kwong Wong,{{#tag:ref|''Daniel Chi-Kwong Wong'': {{zh|first=t,j|t=\u9ec3\u5fd7\u5149|s=\u9ec4\u5fd7\u5149|j=wong4 zi3 gwong1|p=Hu\u00e1ng Zh\u00ecgu\u0101ng|labels=no}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.singtao.ca/toronto/2014-05-10/city1399706077d5044769.html|title=\u7537\u53cb\u7206\u6f58\u5973\u66fe\u906d5\u6f22\u6027\u4fb5 \u8072\u7a31\u6536\u8b66\u544a\u77ed\u8a0a \u77e2\u53e3\u5426\u8a8d\u6d89\u6848|work=[[Sing Tao Daily]]|date=2014-05-10|accessdate=2018-09-18}}</ref>|group=note}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/4th-arrest-in-markham-home-invasion-homicide-1.1038532|agency=[[The Canadian Press]]|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]]|title=4th arrest in Markham home invasion homicide|date=2011-04-26|accessdate=2018-09-18}}</ref> a high school sweetheart whom her parents knew nothing about.<ref name=Revenge/><ref name=\"BrownChineseCubs\">{{cite news|last1=Brown|first1=Vanessa|title=When Chinese cubs turn on their Tiger Parents|url=http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/real-life/true-stories/when-chinese-cubs-turn-on-their-tiger-parents/news-story/36ad884522b2d22ba1e2f88faa5d72ab|accessdate=9 January 2017|work=News.com.au|date=11 December 2016}}</ref><ref>Grimaldi, {{ISBN|1459735269}}, 9781459735262, [[Google Books]] [https://books.google.com/books?id=zomGCwAAQBAJ&pg=PT31 PT 31]: \"[...]commenting on the fact that he was only half Chinese. \"[...]you're [part] Filipino.\"\"</ref> Wong was of mixed Chinese and [[Filipino people|Filipino]] ancestry,<ref name=\"BrownChineseCubs\">{{cite news|last1=Brown|first1=Vanessa|title=When Chinese cubs turn on their Tiger Parents|url=http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/real-life/true-stories/when-chinese-cubs-turn-on-their-tiger-parents/news-story/36ad884522b2d22ba1e2f88faa5d72ab|accessdate=9 January 2017|work=News.com.au|date=11 December 2016}}</ref><ref>Grimaldi, {{ISBN|1459735269}}, 9781459735262, [[Google Books]] [https://books.google.es/books?id=zomGCwAAQBAJ&pg=PT31 PT 31]: \"[...]commenting on the fact that he was only half Chinese. \"[...]you're [part] Filipino.\"\"</ref> resided in [[Ajax, Ontario|Ajax]],<ref name=GillisWendyFifth>{{cite news|author=Gillis, Wendy|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/crime/2011/05/04/fifth_suspect_arrested_in_deadly_markham_home_invasion.html|title=Fifth suspect arrested in deadly Markham home invasion |newspaper=[[Toronto Star]]|date=May 4, 2011|accessdate=September 18, 2018}}</ref> and worked at a [[Boston Pizza]] restaurant.<ref name=GrimaldiPT90>Grimaldi, {{ISBN|1459735269}}, 9781459735262, [https://books.google.cz/books?id=zomGCwAAQBAJ&pg=PT90 PT 90]. \"Daniel Wong is arrested at work in front of his colleagues at Boston Pizza on April 26, 2011.\"</ref> Wong, once a student at Mary Ward, transferred to [[Cardinal Carter Academy]] in North York, Toronto due to low grades<!--\"he was falling behind\"-->, and later studied at [[York University]].<ref name=Revenge/> He was an active marijuana dealer.<ref name=Revenge/><!--\"he had been charged with trafficking after cops found half a pound of weed in his car.\"--><ref name=Dimannoastonishing>{{cite news|last=Dimanno|first=Rosie|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/crime/2014/09/15/the_fantastic_testimony_of_jennifer_pan.html|title=The astonishing testimony of Jennifer Pan|newspaper=[[Toronto Star]]|date=September 15, 2014|accessdate=September 25, 2018|quote=Seven years until Wong \u2014 Pan says he was the one who put her in touch with \u201cHomeboy,\u201d a man he knew through his marijuana dealing}}</ref>\n\n==Adult life==\nWhile pretending to complete her degree at the University of Toronto, Pan told her parents that she had started working as a volunteer at Toronto's [[The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto|Hospital for Sick Children]], known as Sick Kids. Hann and Bich soon became suspicious when they realized she did not have a hospital ID badge or uniform. On one occasion, Bich followed her daughter to \"work\" and quickly discovered her deception. In a state of shock, Hann wanted to throw Jennifer out of the house, but her mother persuaded him to allow her to stay. As she had not completed high school due to failing [[calculus]], she eventually began working to finish high school completely and was later encouraged by her parents to apply to university. She was, however, forbidden to contact Wong or to go anywhere except to her piano-teaching job. Nevertheless, she and Wong spoke clandestinely during this period.<ref name=Revenge/>\n\nBy the time that Jennifer was 24, Wong had grown weary of trying to pursue a relationship with her. As Jennifer was so daunted and restricted by her parents that she lived at home and only met him in secret, Wong began to date another young woman whom he soon fell in love with.<ref name=Revenge/> Pan quickly invented a new story and told Wong that a man had entered her house, showing what appeared to be a police badge. She then told him that several men had rushed in and [[gang-rape]]d her. After this, she insisted that a bullet was mailed to her, telling Wong that it was sent from his new girlfriend.<ref name=Revenge/>\n\n==Murder==\nIn Spring 2010, Pan was in contact with Andrew Montemayor, a high school friend who, she claims, had boasted in their high school years about robbing people at knife point, an assertion denied by Montemayor. Montemayor introduced her to Ricardo Duncan, a \"[[Goth subculture|goth]] kid\" whom Pan gave $1,500 to kill her father in the parking lot at his workplace. Duncan says that she once gave him $200 for a night out, but that he returned it, and that he rebuffed her when she asked him to kill her parents.<ref name=Revenge/>\n\nPan and Wong were back in contact at this time and according to the police, came up with a plan to hire a professional [[hitman]] for $10,000 to kill her parents, calculating that she would then inherit $500,000.

Machapuchare]] from Annapurna Base Camp]]\nThe '''Annapurna Circuit''' is a [[trekking|trek]] within the mountain ranges of central [[Nepal]]. The total length of the route varies between 160\u2013230&nbsp;km (100-145&nbsp;mi), depending on where motor transportation is used and where the trek is ended. This trek crosses two different river valleys and encircles the [[Annapurna Massif]]. The path reaches its highest point at [[Thorung La]] pass (5416m/17769&nbsp;ft), touching the edge of the [[Tibetan plateau]]. Practically all trekkers hike the route anticlockwise, as this way the daily altitude gain is slower, and crossing the high Thorong La pass is easier and safer.\n\nIn addition to the Annapurna Circuit Trek, Annapurna Seven Passes Trek or Annapurna Seven Hills trek is also popular in the region. However, this is less traversed and is off the beaten path trek in the region.   \n\nThe mountain scenery, seen at close quarters includes the Annapurna Massif (Annapurna I-IV), [[Dhaulagiri]], [[Machhapuchhre]], [[Manaslu]], [[Gangapurna]], [[Tilicho Peak]], [[Pisang Peak]], and [[Paungda Danda]].  Numerous other peaks of 6000-8000m in elevation rise from the Annapurna range.\n\nThe trek begins at [[Besisahar]] or Bhulbhule in the [[Marshyangdi]] river valley and concludes in the [[Kali Gandaki Gorge]]. Besisahar can be reached after a seven-hour drive from [[Kathmandu]].  The trail passes along paddy fields and into subtropical forests, several waterfalls and gigantic cliffs, and various villages. \n\nAnnapurna Circuit has often been voted as the best long-distance trek in the world, as it combined, in its old full form, a wide variety of climate zones from tropics at 600 m asl to the arctic at 5416 m asl at the Thorong La pass and cultural variety from Hindu villages at the low foothills to the Tibetan culture of Manang Valley and lower Mustang. Continuing construction of a road has shortened the trail and changed the villages. The Beisahar-Manag road has been built which passes through the trekking trail most of the time.  With construction of the road, mountain biking is becoming popular, with Mustang in particular becoming one of the world's most popular mountain biking destinations.\n\n== Standard trek duration ==\n{{wide image|Annapurna Massif Panorama.jpg|990px|View of Annapurna massif near [[Manang]], [[Nepal]].}}\nThe [https://www.mantraadventure.com/trip/annapurna-circuit-trek/ Annapurna Base Circuit trek] usually takes about 15\u201320 days,<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.alienadv.com/faq/10/Annapurna-Circuit-Trek/|title=Annapurna Circuit Trek|access-date=2016-08-23}}</ref> leaving from Kathmandu with a stopover in [[Pokhara]] before returning to the capital.<ref name=\":0\" /> The trail is moderate to fairly challenging and makes numerous river crossings over steel and wooden [[suspension bridge]]s.

Many trekkers short on time choose to fly out from [[Jomsom Airport]], which shortens the trek by 6 days compared to the original AC.\n\nIt is also possible to continue from Ghorepani to Tadapani, [[Ghandruk]], Landruk and then to Phedi, which follows the old Annapurna Circuit from the time when the road was not yet extended to Beni. This more faithful variation takes three days instead of the shorter one-day exit from Ghorepani to Pokhara outlined above. A popular addition to the AC is a visit to Annapurna Base Camp, ABC (also called [[Annapurna Sanctuary]]). This trail turns to the north from Tadapani and rejoins the old AC at either Ghandruk or Landruk. A visit to the ABC adds about 5 days to the duration of the Annapurna Circuit, slightly less than the normal trek duration to ABC, as trekkers coming from the AC are already acclimatized and \"trail hardened\".\n\nIt is recommended that trekkers take the high trail from [[Pisang]] via [[Ghyaru]] and Ngawal to Manang, as the views are spectacular and the two villages along the route are some of the best preserved samples of Tibetan style villages still in their original state. Sleeping in either of these villages assists with acclimatization, as they are located already higher than Manang. Another side trip gaining popularity is the visit to [[Tilicho Lake|Tilicho Tal]], a lake. There are now lodges along the trail and near the lake at so-called Tilicho Base Camp, so tents are no longer required. If one wishes to cross to Jomsom via the Tilicho route, outdoor camping (and thus a tent) is required.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nepal-dia.de/int__England/EV_Annapurna/EB_Tilicho/eb_tilicho.html|title=Tilicho- Trekking in Nepal Annapurna|website=www.nepal-dia.de|access-date=2016-08-23}}</ref> At certain times of year, snow conditions can make the crossing dangerous or prevent it altogether.\n\nIn October 2014, Seth Wolpin achieved the fastest known time in 72 hours and 4 minutes. He started in Besisahar and finished in Naya Pull, following all New Annapurna Trekking Trails.<ref>http://sethwolpin.com/2014/10/the-annapurna-circuit-going-round-and.html/</ref><ref>http://trailrunningnepal.org/annapurna-circuit-trek-fastest-known-time-fkt/</ref>\n\nIt is reported<ref>http://trailrunningnepal.org/new-annapurna-circuit-fastest-known-time-fkt/</ref> that time has been recently surpassed by Greek athlete and philanthropist Lefteris Paraskevas, who, in May 2017 completed the classic route of the Circuit, from Besisahar to Nayapulin, in 68 hours and 22 minutes.\n\n== Annapurna circuit weather ==\nWhile much of the Himalayas cannot be trekked in the wet season, much of the Annapurna circuit actually sits within a [[rain shadow]]. This means that it is possible to trek most parts of the circuit all year-round, including the monsoon period.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nTrekking in the wet season is often encouraged as hikers avoid the crowds that plague the summer months. However, the days are often damp and many of the views are obscured by cloud.\n\n=== October \u2013 November ===\nThis is the most popular hiking season in Nepal. Due to the recent monsoons, everything along the circuit is refreshed, clean and vibrant. Views are usually clear and the night sky is extremely visible. Though the weather is generally warm, nighttime temperatures drop below freezing. This is the busiest period on the circuit and tea houses book up very quickly.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Best time to trek the Annapurna Circuit - Kandoo Adventures|url = http://www.trekkinginnepal.org/annapurna-circuit-weather/|website = Kandoo Adventures|access-date = 2016-01-19|language = en-gb|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160126171358/http://www.trekkinginnepal.org/annapurna-circuit-weather/|archive-date = 2016-01-26|url-status = dead}}</ref>\n\n=== December \u2013 March ===\nThis is the coldest period on the circuit. Depending on the altitude, day time temperatures will be cold and night time temperatures drop well below freezing. The trade off is that the trails are much less busy. Thorung La Pass, which stands at over 5,400 meters, is often blocked with snow and may be closed for days on end. Unless the snow blocks most trails, tea houses still remain open during this period. Clouds prevail more frequently, but clear days are still common. Towards March the rhododendrons start flowering, which brings hill sides alive with flaming colours. Unfortunately, this period is also when avalanches are most common. Completing the circuit might be possible during December but from January onward it becomes quite challenging and should be avoided unless advised by the locals.\n\n=== April \u2013 May ===\nBecause of the warming weather, April to May is the second most popular trekking season on the Annapurna Circuit.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://trailblazer-guides.com/book/trekking-in-the-annapurna-region/when-to-go|title=Trailblazer Guide Books|website=trailblazer-guides.com|access-date=2016-08-23}}</ref> Most of the snow has dissipated, leaving crystal clear skies. There is often a strange haze that can be seen from the lower altitudes during May. However, this soon passes and cannot be seen from higher up the trail. As the monsoon period builds towards the end of May, the days become hotter and more humid which makes trekking at lower altitude quite uncomfortable.\n\n=== June \u2013 September ===\nThis is the monsoon period. Although there are stories of torrential downpours, mudslides and hordes of leeches, this is rarely the case on the Annapurna Circuit, particular the northern section. Whilst the south section of the Annapurna Circuit near Pokhara does get a lot of rain, the northern parts often receive less than 10% of the precipitation due to the location within a [[rain shadow]]. The upside of trekking in the monsoon period is that many of the flora species flower during this period, making the trek exceptionally beautiful. This is also the time when the Tilicho Lake side trek is relatively easier.\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Annapurna area was opened to foreign trekkers in 1977 after the disputes between CIA backed [[Kham]]pa guerrillas operating from the area into Tibet, and the local populace and Nepal army were settled. The original trek started from the market town of Dhumre situated at the Kathmandu - Pokhara highway and ended in Pokhara, and took about 23 days to complete. Road construction started in early 1980s both from Dhumre to the north and from Pokhara to the west and then up the Kali Gandaki valley. The road has now reached Chamje on the [[Marsyangdi]] river valley and Muktinath on the Kali Gandaki side. Of the trek's original 23 days, only 5 walking days of the trek are now without a motor road. In places new trails and routes have been marked so that the road can be partly avoided. The existence of the road has nevertheless changed the area, appearance, and atmosphere of the villages. The road facilitates transport, increasing the popularity of mountain biking in the area. Since 2011, companies in Muktinath and Jomsom rent out mountain bikes to tourists. As the road sees very little traffic, and one can ride downhill (dirt road and/or single track) from Muktinath to Tatopani and descend almost 3000 meters in 2\u20133 days.\n\nNew areas near Annapurna have been opened for trekkers in the past years, such as Upper Mustang, Naar-Pho Valley, Manaslu and Tsum Valley. Currently, trekking these areas is restricted and subject to extra permits, costs, and other limitations.\n\n==2014 blizzard==\n{{main article|2014 Nepal snowstorm disaster}}\nIn October 2014, a sudden [[blizzard]] killed over 43 people, half of whom were Nepalese.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/16/nepal-blizzard-survivor-deaths-annapurna-refuge Annapurna blizzard]</ref><ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/21/world/asia/nepal-tragedy-reverberates-across-borders.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&version=HpSumSmallMediaHigh&module=second-column-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news&_r=0 Nepalese tragedy]</ref>  It was caused by the tail end of a dying cyclone which had ravaged the eastern coast of India; there were about 350 hikers caught in the blizzard.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/17/world/asia/hikers-blizzard-nepal.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&version=HpSum&module=second-column-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news Hikers caught in blizzard]</ref>\n\n== Communications ==\nMultiple locations of the trek circuit now have an Internet connection.

Machapuchare]] from Annapurna Base Camp]]\nThe '''Annapurna Circuit''' is a [[trekking|trek]] within the mountain ranges of central [[Nepal]]. The total length of the route varies between 160\u2013230&nbsp;km (100-145&nbsp;mi), depending on where motor transportation is used and where the trek is ended. This trek crosses two different river valleys and encircles the [[Annapurna Massif]]. The path reaches its highest point at [[Thorung La]] pass (5416m/17769&nbsp;ft), touching the edge of the [[Tibetan plateau]]. Practically all trekkers hike the route anticlockwise, as this way the daily altitude gain is slower, and crossing the high Thorong La pass is easier and safer.\n\nIn addition to the Annapurna Circuit Trek, Annapurna Seven Passes Trek or Annapurna Seven Hills trek is also popular in the region. However, this is less traversed and is off the beaten path trek in the region.   \n\nThe mountain scenery, seen at close quarters includes the Annapurna Massif (Annapurna I-IV), [[Dhaulagiri]], [[Machhapuchhre]], [[Manaslu]], [[Gangapurna]], [[Tilicho Peak]], [[Pisang Peak]], and [[Paungda Danda]].  Numerous other peaks of 6000-8000m in elevation rise from the Annapurna range.\n\nThe trek begins at [[Besisahar]] or Bhulbhule in the [[Marshyangdi]] river valley and concludes in the [[Kali Gandaki Gorge]]. Besisahar can be reached after a seven-hour drive from [[Kathmandu]].  The trail passes along paddy fields and into subtropical forests, several waterfalls and gigantic cliffs, and various villages. \n\nAnnapurna Circuit has often been voted as the best long-distance trek in the world, as it combined, in its old full form, a wide variety of climate zones from tropics at 600 m asl to the arctic at 5416 m asl at the Thorong La pass and cultural variety from Hindu villages at the low foothills to the Tibetan culture of Manang Valley and lower Mustang. Continuing construction of a road has shortened the trail and changed the villages. The Beisahar-Manag road has been built which passes through the trekking trail most of the time.  With construction of the road, mountain biking is becoming popular, with Mustang in particular becoming one of the world's most popular mountain biking destinations.\n\n== Standard trek duration ==\n{{wide image|Annapurna Massif Panorama.jpg|990px|View of Annapurna massif near [[Manang]], [[Nepal]].}}\nThe [https://www.mantraadventure.com/trip/annapurna-circuit-trek/ Annapurna Base Circuit trek] usually takes about 15\u201320 days,<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.alienadv.com/faq/10/Annapurna-Circuit-Trek/|title=Annapurna Circuit Trek|access-date=2016-08-23}}</ref> leaving from Kathmandu with a stopover in [[Pokhara]] before returning to the capital.<ref name=\":0\" /> The trail is moderate to fairly challenging and makes numerous river crossings over steel and wooden [[suspension bridge]]s.

Many trekkers short on time choose to fly out from [[Jomsom Airport]], which shortens the trek by 6 days compared to the original AC.\n\nIt is also possible to continue from Ghorepani to Tadapani, [[Ghandruk]], Landruk and then to Phedi, which follows the old Annapurna Circuit from the time when the road was not yet extended to Beni. This more faithful variation takes three days instead of the shorter one-day exit from Ghorepani to Pokhara outlined above. A popular addition to the AC is a visit to Annapurna Base Camp, ABC (also called [[Annapurna Sanctuary]]). This trail turns to the north from Tadapani and rejoins the old AC at either Ghandruk or Landruk. A visit to the ABC adds about 5 days to the duration of the Annapurna Circuit, slightly less than the normal trek duration to ABC, as trekkers coming from the AC are already acclimatized and \"trail hardened\".\n\nIt is recommended that trekkers take the high trail from [[Pisang]] via [[Ghyaru]] and Ngawal to Manang, as the views are spectacular and the two villages along the route are some of the best preserved samples of Tibetan style villages still in their original state. Sleeping in either of these villages assists with acclimatization, as they are located already higher than Manang. Another side trip gaining popularity is the visit to [[Tilicho Lake|Tilicho Tal]], a lake. There are now lodges along the trail and near the lake at so-called Tilicho Base Camp, so tents are no longer required. If one wishes to cross to Jomsom via the Tilicho route, outdoor camping (and thus a tent) is required.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nepal-dia.de/int__England/EV_Annapurna/EB_Tilicho/eb_tilicho.html|title=Tilicho- Trekking in Nepal Annapurna|website=www.nepal-dia.de|access-date=2016-08-23}}</ref> At certain times of year, snow conditions can make the crossing dangerous or prevent it altogether.\n\nIn October 2014, Seth Wolpin achieved the fastest known time in 72 hours and 4 minutes. He started in Besisahar and finished in Naya Pull, following all New Annapurna Trekking Trails.<ref>http://sethwolpin.com/2014/10/the-annapurna-circuit-going-round-and.html/</ref><ref>http://trailrunningnepal.org/annapurna-circuit-trek-fastest-known-time-fkt/</ref>\n\nIt is reported<ref>http://trailrunningnepal.org/new-annapurna-circuit-fastest-known-time-fkt/</ref> that, the previous record of the Annapurna Circuit held by Seth Wolpin has been recently surpassed by the Greek athlete and philanthropist Lefteris Paraskevas, who, in May 2017 completed the classic route of the Circuit, from Besisahar to Nayapulin, in 68 hours and 22 minutes, achieving thus a new Fastest Known Time for the route.\n\n== Annapurna circuit weather ==\nWhile much of the Himalayas cannot be trekked in the wet season, much of the Annapurna circuit actually sits within a [[rain shadow]]. This means that it is possible to trek most parts of the circuit all year-round, including the monsoon period.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nTrekking in the wet season is often encouraged as hikers avoid the crowds that plague the summer months. However, the days are often damp and many of the views are obscured by cloud.\n\n=== October \u2013 November ===\nThis is the most popular hiking season in Nepal. Due to the recent monsoons, everything along the circuit is refreshed, clean and vibrant. Views are usually clear and the night sky is extremely visible. Though the weather is generally warm, nighttime temperatures drop below freezing. This is the busiest period on the circuit and tea houses book up very quickly.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Best time to trek the Annapurna Circuit - Kandoo Adventures|url = http://www.trekkinginnepal.org/annapurna-circuit-weather/|website = Kandoo Adventures|access-date = 2016-01-19|language = en-gb|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160126171358/http://www.trekkinginnepal.org/annapurna-circuit-weather/|archive-date = 2016-01-26|url-status = dead}}</ref>\n\n=== December \u2013 March ===\nThis is the coldest period on the circuit. Depending on the altitude, day time temperatures will be cold and night time temperatures drop well below freezing. The trade off is that the trails are much less busy. Thorung La Pass, which stands at over 5,400 meters, is often blocked with snow and may be closed for days on end. Unless the snow blocks most trails, tea houses still remain open during this period. Clouds prevail more frequently, but clear days are still common. Towards March the rhododendrons start flowering, which brings hill sides alive with flaming colours. Unfortunately, this period is also when avalanches are most common. Completing the circuit might be possible during December but from January onward it becomes quite challenging and should be avoided unless advised by the locals.\n\n=== April \u2013 May ===\nBecause of the warming weather, April to May is the second most popular trekking season on the Annapurna Circuit.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://trailblazer-guides.com/book/trekking-in-the-annapurna-region/when-to-go|title=Trailblazer Guide Books|website=trailblazer-guides.com|access-date=2016-08-23}}</ref> Most of the snow has dissipated, leaving crystal clear skies. There is often a strange haze that can be seen from the lower altitudes during May. However, this soon passes and cannot be seen from higher up the trail. As the monsoon period builds towards the end of May, the days become hotter and more humid which makes trekking at lower altitude quite uncomfortable.\n\n=== June \u2013 September ===\nThis is the monsoon period. Although there are stories of torrential downpours, mudslides and hordes of leeches, this is rarely the case on the Annapurna Circuit, particular the northern section. Whilst the south section of the Annapurna Circuit near Pokhara does get a lot of rain, the northern parts often receive less than 10% of the precipitation due to the location within a [[rain shadow]]. The upside of trekking in the monsoon period is that many of the flora species flower during this period, making the trek exceptionally beautiful. This is also the time when the Tilicho Lake side trek is relatively easier.\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Annapurna area was opened to foreign trekkers in 1977 after the disputes between CIA backed [[Kham]]pa guerrillas operating from the area into Tibet, and the local populace and Nepal army were settled. The original trek started from the market town of Dhumre situated at the Kathmandu - Pokhara highway and ended in Pokhara, and took about 23 days to complete. Road construction started in early 1980s both from Dhumre to the north and from Pokhara to the west and then up the Kali Gandaki valley. The road has now reached Chamje on the [[Marsyangdi]] river valley and Muktinath on the Kali Gandaki side. Of the trek's original 23 days, only 5 walking days of the trek are now without a motor road. In places new trails and routes have been marked so that the road can be partly avoided. The existence of the road has nevertheless changed the area, appearance, and atmosphere of the villages. The road facilitates transport, increasing the popularity of mountain biking in the area. Since 2011, companies in Muktinath and Jomsom rent out mountain bikes to tourists. As the road sees very little traffic, and one can ride downhill (dirt road and/or single track) from Muktinath to Tatopani and descend almost 3000 meters in 2\u20133 days.\n\nNew areas near Annapurna have been opened for trekkers in the past years, such as Upper Mustang, Naar-Pho Valley, Manaslu and Tsum Valley. Currently, trekking these areas is restricted and subject to extra permits, costs, and other limitations.\n\n==2014 blizzard==\n{{main article|2014 Nepal snowstorm disaster}}\nIn October 2014, a sudden [[blizzard]] killed over 43 people, half of whom were Nepalese.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/16/nepal-blizzard-survivor-deaths-annapurna-refuge Annapurna blizzard]</ref><ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/21/world/asia/nepal-tragedy-reverberates-across-borders.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&version=HpSumSmallMediaHigh&module=second-column-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news&_r=0 Nepalese tragedy]</ref>  It was caused by the tail end of a dying cyclone which had ravaged the eastern coast of India; there were about 350 hikers caught in the blizzard.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/17/world/asia/hikers-blizzard-nepal.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&version=HpSum&module=second-column-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news Hikers caught in blizzard]</ref>\n\n== Communications ==\nMultiple locations of the trek circuit now have an Internet connection.

They were first recruited during the [[American Civil War]], and by the end of that war in April 1865, the 175 USCT regiments constituted about one-tenth of the manpower of the [[Union Army]]. About 20% of USCT soldiers died, a rate about 35% higher than that for white Union troops. Despite heavy casualties, many fought with distinction, 15 USCT soldiers receiving the [[List of American Civil War Medal of Honor recipients|Medal of Honor]] and numerous others receiving other honors.\n\nThe USCT regiments were precursors to the [[Buffalo Soldier]] regiments in the American [[Old West]].\n\nThis article is fake.

African Americans, mostly escaped slaves, had been recruited into the [[1st Regiment Kansas Volunteer Infantry (African Descent)|1st Kansas Colored Volunteers.]] They accompanied white troops to Missouri to break up Confederate [[guerrilla]] activities based at Hog Island near Butler, Missouri.

The most famous USCT action took place at the [[Battle of the Crater]] during the [[Siege of Petersburg]]. Regiments of USCT suffered heavy casualties attempting to break through [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] lines. Other notable engagements include [[Fort Wagner]], one of their first major tests, and the [[Battle of Nashville]].<ref name=\"cornish173\"/>\n\nUSCT soldiers were among the first Union forces to enter [[Richmond, Virginia]], after its fall in April 1865. The 41st USCT regiment was among those present at the surrender of the [[Army of Northern Virginia]] at [[Appomattox Court House National Historical Park|Appomattox]]. Following the war, USCT regiments served among the occupation troops in former Confederate states.\n\nU.S. Army General [[Ulysses S. Grant]] praised the competent performance and bearing of the USCT, saying at Vicksburg that:\n\n{{quote|Negro troops are easier to preserve discipline among than our white troops ...

The law became a stumbling block for prisoner exchange, as the U.S. government in the [[Lieber Code]] objected to such discriminatory mistreatment of prisoners of war on basis of ethnicity.

In 1867, the Regular Army was set at ten regiments of cavalry and 45 regiments of infantry. The Army was authorized to raise two regiments of black cavalry (the [[9th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|9th]] and [[10th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|10th (Colored) Cavalry)]] and four regiments of black infantry (the [[38th Infantry Regiment (United States)|38th]], [[39th Infantry Regiment (United States)|39th]], [[40th Infantry Regiment (United States)|40th]], and [[41st Infantry Regiment (United States)|41st (Colored) Infantry)]], who were mostly drawn from USCT veterans. The first draft of the bill that the House Committee on Military Affairs sent to the full chamber on March 7, 1866 did not include a provision for regiments of black cavalry; however, this provision was added by Senator [[Benjamin Wade]] prior to the bill's passing.<ref name=\"Schubert\">{{cite book |last=Schubert |first=Frank N. |title=Black Valor: Buffalo Soldiers and the Medal of Honor, 1870-1898 |pp=[https://archive.org/details/blackvalorbuffal00schu/page/4 4-5] |publisher=Scholarly Resources Inc. |date=1997 |isbn=9780842025867 |url=https://archive.org/details/blackvalorbuffal00schu/page/4 }}</ref> In 1869 the Regular Army was kept at ten regiments of cavalry but cut to 25 regiments of Infantry, reducing the black complement to two regiments (the [[24th Infantry Regiment (United States)|24th]] and [[25th Infantry Regiment (United States)|25th (Colored) Infantry)]].\n\nThe two black infantry regiments represented 10 percent of the size of all twenty-five infantry regiments.

Gen.]] [[Benjamin Butler (politician)|Benjamin Butler]]. In 1861 at [[Fort Monroe]] in Virginia, Butler was the first to declare [[refugee]] slaves as [[Contraband (American Civil War)|contraband]] and refused to return them to slaveholders. This became a policy throughout the [[Union Army]]; it started when a few slaves escaped to Butler's lines in 1861. Their owner, a Confederate colonel, came to Butler under a flag of truce and demanded that they be returned to him under the [[Fugitive slave laws#1850 Fugitive Slave Act|Fugitive Slave Act]] of 1850. Butler informed him that since Virginia claimed to have left the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]], the Fugitive Slave Law no longer applied, declaring the slaves to be contraband of war.\n\n[[List of African-American Medal of Honor recipients|Sixteen African-American USCT soldiers]] earned the [[Medal of Honor]], the nation's highest award, for service in the war:<ref>{{cite book|last=Schubert|first=Frank N.|title=Black Valor: Buffalo Soldiers and the Medal of Honor, 1870-1898|pp=[https://archive.org/details/blackvalorbuffal00schu/page/2 2-4]|publisher=Scholarly Resources Inc.|date=1997|isbn=9780842025867|url=https://archive.org/details/blackvalorbuffal00schu/page/2}}</ref>\n* Sergeant [[William Harvey Carney]] of the [[54th Regiment Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry|54th Massachusetts (Colored) Volunteer Infantry]] was awarded the [[Medal of Honor]] for his actions at the [[Second Battle of Fort Wagner|Battle of Fort Wagner]] in July 1863. During the advance, Carney was wounded but still went on. When the color-bearer was shot, Carney grabbed the flagstaff and planted it in the parapet, while the rest of his regiment stormed the fortification. When his regiment was forced to retreat, he was wounded two more times while he carried the colors back to Union lines. He did not relinquish it until he handed it to another soldier of the 54th. Carney received his medal 37 years after the battle.\n* Fourteen African-American soldiers, including Sergeant Major [[Christian Fleetwood]] and Sergeant [[Alfred B. Hilton]] (mortally wounded) of the [[4th United States Colored Infantry Regiment|4th USCT]], were awarded the Medal of Honor for their actions at the [[Battle of Chaffin's Farm]] in September 1864, during the campaign to take Petersburg.\n* Corporal [[Andrew Jackson Smith (Medal of Honor)|Andrew Jackson Smith]] of the 55th Massachusetts (Colored) Volunteer Infantry was recommended for the Medal of Honor for his actions at the [[Battle of Honey Hill]] in November 1864. Smith prevented the regimental colors from falling into enemy hands after the color sergeant was killed.

During the war years, the men had difficulty gaining deserved official recognition for achievement and valor. Often recommendations for decorations were filed away and ignored. Another problem was that the government would mail the award certificate and medal to the recipient, who had to pay the postage due (whether he were white or black).

They were first recruited during the [[American Civil War]], and by the end of that war in April 1865, the 175 USCT regiments constituted about one-tenth of the manpower of the [[Union Army]]. About 20% of USCT soldiers died, a rate about 35% higher than that for white Union troops. Despite heavy casualties, many fought with distinction, 15 USCT soldiers receiving the [[List of American Civil War Medal of Honor recipients|Medal of Honor]] and numerous others receiving other honors.\n\nThe USCT regiments were precursors to the [[Buffalo Soldier]] regiments in the American [[Old West]].\n\n==History==\n{{main|Military history of African Americans in the American Civil War}}\n\n===The Confiscation Act===\n[[File:DutchGapb.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|USCT soldiers at an abandoned farmhouse in [[Dutch Gap]], Virginia, 1864]]\n\nThe [[U.S. Congress]] passed the [[Confiscation Act of 1862]]<ref>Rodriguez, Junius P.

It freed slaves whose owners were in rebellion against the United States, and the [[Militia Act of 1862]] empowered the President to use former slaves in any capacity in the army. President [[Abraham Lincoln]] was concerned with public opinion in the four [[Border states (Civil War)|border states]] that remained in the Union, as they had numerous slaveholders, as well as with northern Democrats who supported the war but were less supportive of abolition than many northern Republicans. Lincoln opposed early efforts to recruit [[African-American ]] soldiers, although he accepted the Army using them as paid workers.

In 1863 a former slave, [[William Henry Singleton]], helped recruit 1,000 former slaves in [[New Bern, North Carolina]] for the [[First North Carolina Colored Volunteers]]. He became a sergeant in the 35th USCT. Freedmen from the [[Freedmen's Colony of Roanoke Island|Roanoke Island Freedmen's Colony]], established in 1863 on the island, also formed part of the Free North Carolina Colored Volunteers (FNCCV) and subsequently the 35th.<ref name=\"CCM\">[http://www.carolinacountry.com/storypages/ourstories/freedmen/freedmen.html \"The Roanoke Island Freedmen's Colony\"]; ''Carolina Country Magazine'', date?, accessed November 10, 2010</ref> Nearly all of the volunteer regiments were converted into USCT units.\n\nIn 1922 Singleton published his memoir (in a [[slave narrative]]) of his journey from slavery to freedom and becoming a Union soldier. Glad to participate in reunions, years later at the age of 95, he marched in a [[Grand Army of the Republic]] (GAR) event in 1938.\n\n===State volunteers===\nFour regiments were considered Regular units, rather than auxiliaries. Their veteran status allowed them to get valuable federal government jobs after the war, from which African Americans had usually been excluded in earlier years. However, the men received no formal recognition for combat honors and awards until the turn of the 20th century.\n\nThese units were:\n* [[5th Regiment Massachusetts Colored Volunteer Cavalry]]\n* [[54th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment|54th Massachusetts (Colored) Volunteer Infantry Regiment]]\n* [[55th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment|55th Massachusetts (Colored) Volunteer Infantry Regiment]]\n* [[29th Connecticut Infantry Regiment (Colored)|29th Connecticut (Colored) Volunteer Infantry Regiment]]\n* [[30th Connecticut Volunteer Infantry Regiment]]\n* [[31st Infantry Regiment, United States Colored Troops|31st Infantry Regiment (Colored)]]\n\n===Corps d'Afrique===\n[[File:Gordon, scourged back, in uniform, 1863.png|thumb|250px|Escaped slave, [[Gordon (slave)|Gordon]] (or \"Whipped Peter\"), in USCT uniform]]\n\nThe Corps d'Afrique, one of many [[List of Louisiana Union Civil War units|Louisiana Union Civil War units]], was formed in [[New Orleans]] after the city was taken and occupied by Union forces. It was formed in part from the [[1st Louisiana Native Guard (United States)|Louisiana Native Guards]]. The Native Guards were former militia units raised in New Orleans, who were property-owning [[free people of color]] (''gens du couleur libres'').<ref>This group of [[mixed-race]] people were descended generally from male native-born Spanish and French colonists (called ''Criolla'' or ''Cr\u00e9ole'') and African slave women, or free African-American women. After the United States made the [[Louisiana Purchase]] (1803), many Americans moved to Louisiana. They ignored the status of the free people of color, grouping them with the mass of blacks, then mostly slaves. (Today the people of color descended from this group are generally referred to as [[Louisiana Creole]]s.)</ref>\n\nFree [[mixed-race]] people had developed as a third class in New Orleans since the colonial years. During the Civil War, many of the free men of color wanted to prove their bravery and loyalty to the Confederacy like other Southern property owners, but the Confederates did not allow them to serve and [[Right to keep and bear arms|confiscated the arms]] of those in the militia. The Confederates believed that enlisting black soldiers would hurt agriculture, as most African Americans were enslaved workers.\n\nFor later units of the Corps d'Afrique, the Union recruited [[freedmen]] from the refugee camps. Liberated from nearby plantations, they and their families had no means to earn a living and no place to go. Local commanders, starved for replacements, started equipping volunteer units with cast-off uniforms and obsolete or captured firearms. The men were treated and paid as auxiliaries, performing guard or picket duties to free up white soldiers for maneuver units. In exchange their families were fed, clothed and housed for free at the Army camps; often schools were set up for them and their children.\n\nDespite class differences between free people of color and freedmen, the troops of the Corps d'Afrique served with distinction, including at the [[Battle of Port Hudson]] and throughout the South. Its units included:\n* 4 Regiments of Louisiana Native Guards (renamed the 1st\u20134th Corps d'Afrique Infantry, later renamed as the 73rd\u201376th US Colored Infantry on April 4, 1864).\n* 1st and 2nd Brigade Marching Bands, Corps d'Afrique (later made into Nos. 1 and 2 Bands, USCT).\n* 1st Regiment of Cavalry (1st Corps d'Afrique Cavalry, later made into the 4th US Colored Cavalry).\n* 22 Regiments of Infantry (1st\u201320th, 22nd, and 26th Corps d'Afrique Infantry, later converted into the 77th\u201379th, 80th\u201383rd, 84th\u201388th, and 89th\u201393rd US Colored Infantry on April 4, 1864).\n* 5 Regiments of Engineers (1st\u20135th Corps d'Afrique Engineers, later converted into the 95th\u201399th US Colored Infantry regiments on April 4, 1864) whose work building [[Bailey's Dam]] saved the Union navy's [[Mississippi River Squadron]].\n* 1 Regiment of Heavy Artillery (later converted into the 10th US Colored (Heavy) Artillery on May 21, 1864).\n\n===Right Wing, XVI Corps (1864)===\nColored troops served as laborers in the 16th Army Corps' [[Quartermaster|Quartermaster's Department]] and [[Pioneer (military)|Pioneer Corps]].\n* Detachment, Quartermaster's Department.\n* [[Pioneer (military)|Pioneer Corps,]] 1st Division ([[Joseph A.

The most famous USCT action took place at the [[Battle of the Crater]] during the [[Siege of Petersburg]]. Regiments of USCT suffered heavy casualties attempting to break through [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] lines. Other notable engagements include [[Fort Wagner]], one of their first major tests, and the [[Battle of Nashville]].<ref name=\"cornish173\"/>\n\nUSCT soldiers were among the first Union forces to enter [[Richmond, Virginia]], after its fall in April 1865.

Following the war, USCT regiments served among the occupation troops in former Confederate states.\n\nU.S. Army General [[Ulysses S.

In 1867, the Regular Army was set at ten regiments of cavalry and 45 regiments of infantry. The Army was authorized to raise two regiments of black cavalry (the [[9th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|9th]] and [[10th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|10th (Colored) Cavalry)]] and four regiments of black infantry (the [[38th Infantry Regiment (United States)|38th]], [[39th Infantry Regiment (United States)|39th]], [[40th Infantry Regiment (United States)|40th]], and [[41st Infantry Regiment (United States)|41st (Colored) Infantry)]], who were mostly drawn from USCT veterans. The first draft of the bill that the House Committee on Military Affairs sent to the full chamber on March 7, 1866 did not include a provision for regiments of black cavalry; however, this provision was added by Senator [[Benjamin Wade]] prior to the bill's passing.<ref name=\"Schubert\">{{cite book |last=Schubert |first=Frank N. |title=Black Valor: Buffalo Soldiers and the Medal of Honor, 1870-1898 |pp=[https://archive.org/details/blackvalorbuffal00schu/page/4 4-5] |publisher=Scholarly Resources Inc. |date=1997 |isbn=9780842025867 |url=https://archive.org/details/blackvalorbuffal00schu/page/4 }}</ref> In 1869 the Regular Army was kept at ten regiments of cavalry but cut to 25 regiments of Infantry, reducing the black complement to two regiments (the [[24th Infantry Regiment (United States)|24th]] and [[25th Infantry Regiment (United States)|25th (Colored) Infantry)]].\n\nThe two black infantry regiments represented 10 percent of the size of all twenty-five infantry regiments.

Civil War, Medal of Honor recipient]]\n\nSoldiers who fought in the [[Army of the James]] were eligible for the [[Butler Medal]], commissioned by that army's commander, [[Major General|Maj. Gen.]] [[Benjamin Butler (politician)|Benjamin Butler]]. In 1861 at [[Fort Monroe]] in Virginia, Butler was the first to declare [[refugee]] slaves as [[Contraband (American Civil War)|contraband]] and refused to return them to slaveholders. This became a policy throughout the [[Union Army]]; it started when a few slaves escaped to Butler's lines in 1861. Their owner, a Confederate colonel, came to Butler under a flag of truce and demanded that they be returned to him under the [[Fugitive slave laws#1850 Fugitive Slave Act|Fugitive Slave Act]] of 1850. Butler informed him that since Virginia claimed to have left the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]], the Fugitive Slave Law no longer applied, declaring the slaves to be contraband of war.\n\n[[List of African-American Medal of Honor recipients|Sixteen African-American USCT soldiers]] earned the [[Medal of Honor]], the nation's highest award, for service in the war:<ref>{{cite book|last=Schubert|first=Frank N.|title=Black Valor: Buffalo Soldiers and the Medal of Honor, 1870-1898|pp=[https://archive.org/details/blackvalorbuffal00schu/page/2 2-4]|publisher=Scholarly Resources Inc.|date=1997|isbn=9780842025867|url=https://archive.org/details/blackvalorbuffal00schu/page/2}}</ref>\n* Sergeant [[William Harvey Carney]] of the [[54th Regiment Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry|54th Massachusetts (Colored) Volunteer Infantry]] was awarded the [[Medal of Honor]] for his actions at the [[Second Battle of Fort Wagner|Battle of Fort Wagner]] in July 1863. During the advance, Carney was wounded but still went on. When the color-bearer was shot, Carney grabbed the flagstaff and planted it in the parapet, while the rest of his regiment stormed the fortification. When his regiment was forced to retreat, he was wounded two more times while he carried the colors back to Union lines. He did not relinquish it until he handed it to another soldier of the 54th. Carney received his medal 37 years after the battle.\n* Fourteen African-American soldiers, including Sergeant Major [[Christian Fleetwood]] and Sergeant [[Alfred B. Hilton]] (mortally wounded) of the [[4th United States Colored Infantry Regiment|4th USCT]], were awarded the Medal of Honor for their actions at the [[Battle of Chaffin's Farm]] in September 1864, during the campaign to take Petersburg.\n* Corporal [[Andrew Jackson Smith (Medal of Honor)|Andrew Jackson Smith]] of the 55th Massachusetts (Colored) Volunteer Infantry was recommended for the Medal of Honor for his actions at the [[Battle of Honey Hill]] in November 1864. Smith prevented the regimental colors from falling into enemy hands after the color sergeant was killed. Due to a lack of official records, he was not awarded the medal until 2001.\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:WilliamCarney.jpeg|thumb|upright=1.2|Sgt.

E. B. Du Bois]]. Since the 1970s and the expansion of historical coverage of minorities, the units and their contributions have been the subject of more books and movies. During the war years, the men had difficulty gaining deserved official recognition for achievement and valor. Often recommendations for decorations were filed away and ignored. Another problem was that the government would mail the award certificate and medal to the recipient, who had to pay the postage due (whether he were white or black). Most former USCT recipients had to return the medals for lack of funds to redeem them.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}.The last USCT soldier Joseph Clovese died in 1951.<ref>[https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/42199181/joseph-clovese Pvt Joseph Clovese 1844-1951]</ref>\n\nThe motion picture ''[[Glory (1989 film)|Glory]]'', starring [[Denzel Washington]], [[Morgan Freeman]] and [[Matthew Broderick]], portrayed the African-American soldiers of the [[54th Massachusetts Regiment|54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry Regiment]].
