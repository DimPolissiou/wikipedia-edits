Shortly after she begins fighting crime, one of her classmates, [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]], attempts to exact revenge on those who bullied him in Midtown High School, becoming Earth-65's version of the [[Lizard (comics)|Lizard]]. Gwen subdues him, but Peter dies towards the end of the battle due to the chemical he used. Spider-Woman is blamed for his death, causing an outcry for her arrest, led by [[J. Jonah Jameson]].

While the Mary Janes are attempting to perform in a concert, [[Rhino (comics)|an assassin]] is sent after Gwen Stacy's father, who is in the audience. As Spider-Woman, she successfully defeats the assassin. During the battle, Captain Stacy holds Spider-Woman at gun point, with Gwen Stacy taking off her mask to reveal who she is to her father.

Murdock and scientist Elsa Brock eventually found a way for Gwen to regain her powers and rid her friend Harry Osborn of the Lizard serum by combining the serum with the isotopes to form the Venom symbiote. She succeeds and ends up bonding to the symbiote, but Murdock allowed Rhino to beat George up in prison after she refused to turn Harry over to the Hand. This caused her to succumb to the symbiote's influence and she began brutally attacking the Hand and other criminals. After realizing how far she was taking it, she revealed her secret identity to the Parkers and her band mates. Ben encouraged Gwen to take revenge on Murdock and she almost succeeded in killing him, but decided against it after finding out that Murdock was testing to see if she could be corrupted by power as he was. The dimensional teleportation device Murdock stole from Gwen then sent her to Earth-617, a reality similar to Earth-616 prior to that Gwen's death. This universe's Gwen helps her with creating a portal back to her own dimension and makes her realize how lucky she is to have her dad still alive. Shortly after returning, she finally defeated Murdock, took full control over the symbiote, revealed her secret identity to the public, and was convicted for one year in a maximum security S.H.I.E.L.D. prison, despite an offer by Captain America to join a black ops team to reduce her sentences.<ref>''Spider-Gwen Vol. 2'' #10-34</ref>\n\n===Ghost-Spider===\nAfter finishing her prison sentence, Gwen tried to return to her normal life of superhero activities, drumming with the Mary Janes, and attempting to rekindle her relationships with Harry and her father. However, it proved to be challenging since she no longer had a secret identity, resulting in being treated either warmly or disdainfully by a number of people in public, as well as attacks by many criminals like the [[Man-Wolf]] against her and her associates. Additionally, her symbiote started acting up and gave her massive headaches while dropping gummy spiders everywhere. Since the symbiote's creator, Elsa Brock, has disappeared from the public, she uses her dimension hopping device to travel to Earth-616 to find Elsa's counterpart, [[Eddie Brock]] aka Venom. She runs into Earth-616 Peter Parker, who volunteers to analyze the symbiote at Empire State University for her. During her visit, she realizes that her secret identity is still intact in this dimension and decides to use it to her advantage.

Murdock and scientist Elsa Brock eventually found a way for Gwen to regain her powers and rid her friend Harry Osborn of the Lizard serum by combining the serum with the isotopes to form the Venom symbiote. She succeeds and ends up bonding to the symbiote, but Murdock allowed Rhino to beat George up in prison after she refused to turn Harry over to the Hand. This caused her to succumb to the symbiote's influence and she began brutally attacking the Hand and other criminals. After realizing how far she was taking it, she revealed her secret identity to the Parkers and her band mates. Ben encouraged Gwen to take revenge on Murdock and she almost succeeded in killing him, but decided against it after finding out that Murdock was testing to see if she could be corrupted by power as he was. The dimensional teleportation device Murdock stole from Gwen then sent her to Earth-617, a reality similar to Earth-616 prior to that Gwen's death. This universe's Gwen helps her with creating a portal back to her own dimension and makes her realize how lucky she is to have her dad still alive. Shortly after returning, she finally defeated Murdock, took full control over the symbiote, revealed her secret identity to the public, and was convicted for one year in a maximum security S.H.I.E.L.D. prison, despite an offer by Captain America to join a black ops team to reduce her sentences.<ref>''Spider-Gwen Vol. 2'' #10-34</ref>\n\n===Ghost-Spider===\nAfter finishing her prison sentence, Gwen tried to return to her normal life of superhero activities, drumming with the Mary Janes, and attempting to rekindle her relationships with Harry and her father. However, it proved to be challenging since she no longer had a secret identity, resulting in being treated either warmly or disdainfully by a number of people in public, as well as attacks by many criminals like the [[Man-Wolf]] against her and her associates. Additionally, her symbiote started acting up and gave her massive headaches while dropping gummy spiders everywhere. Since the symbiote's creator, Elsa Brock, has disappeared from the public, she uses her dimension hopping device to travel to Earth-616 to find Elsa's counterpart, [[Eddie Brock]] aka Venom. She runs into Earth-616 Peter Parker, who volunteers to analyze the symbiote at Empire State University for her. During her visit, she realizes that her secret identity is still intact in this dimension and decides to use it to her advantage. She starts calling herself \"Ghost-Spider\" (since she believes \"death loves Gwen Stacy\") and enrolls in Earth-616's Empire State University to get a college education somewhere where she's not a celebrity.<ref>''Spider-Gwen: Ghost Spider Vol. 1'' #1-10</ref>\n\n===Other appearances===\nSpider-Gwen is depicted as a recurring protagonist in the \"[[Spider-Verse]]\" storyline.

The device causes Gwen to arrive in the dimension one week prior to the accelerator explosion. Following her Spider Sense, she posed as a student at Miles' school where a mishap with his new spider powers causes the right side of her head to be shaved, much to her displeasure. Gwen is later seen in Alchemax, when Miles and Spider-Man are stealing information, that will help send them home. She intervenes in time to secure the data, and save the pair from Doc Ock. Along with the other Spider-People, Gwen is unconvinced that Miles has what it takes to help, and will only be a hindrance. She participates in the final battle at the particle accelerator, where Miles proves himself and helps her and the other Spiders return to their own dimensions. \n*Spider-Gwen will appear in a

enough games to earn a winner's medal. He was also part of the Sheffield Wednesday side that won promotion to the First Division in 1984, after 14 years away. He was sold to West Bromwich Albion a year later and was their top scorer with nine league goals in 1985-86, but was unable to prevent them from being relegated in bottom place with just 4 wins in the league. He was then sold to Manchester City, and was unable to prevent their relegation the following season, although he did help them reach the quarter-finals of the FA Cup in his second campaign there. He was nicknamed \"Imre Banana\" by the City fans, following the [[inflatable banana]] craze which the club's fans helped start that season.\n\nHe left [[Maine Road]] to sign for [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] for a second time in the summer of 1988, and spent two seasons there, before they were relegated to the Second Division and he was sold to newly promoted [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]]. He spent three seasons at [[Elland Road]], but rarely played after his [[1990-91 in English football|1990-91]] first season there, and did not make enough appearances in [[1991-92 in English football|1991-92]] to earn a league title medal. He had loan spells at [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]] and [[Oxford United F.C.|Oxford United]] before dropping down two divisions to sign for [[Rotherham United F.C.|Rotherham United]] in the summer of 1993.\n\nHe spent two seasons at [[Millmoor]], scoring 25 Division Two goals, before brief spells at [[Mansfield Town F.C.|Mansfield Town]] and [[Scunthorpe United F.C.|Scunthorpe United]]. He called time on his professional career in 1995 when he became player-manager of non-league [[Matlock Town F.C.|Matlock Town]], where he spent two years.\n\nIn 1984, he was approached by the Hungarian FA as to his willingness to play for Hungary, but he turned them down, pointing out that they already had good strikers and attacking midfielders.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.leeds-fans.org.uk/leeds/history/77.html\n|title=Leeds United: Season 1991 - 1992: Division One\n|publisher=leeds-fans.org.uk\n|accessdate=10 August 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Post-retirement==\n\nHe became a fully licensed [[FIFA]] Agent in March 2004 and provides commentary on games for both [[PA Sport]] (for the [[Football Live]] project) and [[BBC Radio Sheffield]].<ref name=hattersheroes/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Soccerbase}}\n\n{{Sheffield Wednesday F.C.

After practicing different sports and supported by her father, her mother Ingegerd and her brother Mats, Neumann begun playing golf at the local 9-hole course at Finsp\u00e5ng Golf Club, founded in 1965. She showed early promise and won the unofficial national youth championships, Colgate Cup, in three different levels, as a 12-, 14-, and 16-year old. Neumann has later given a lot of credit, for her successful career, to her local coach since her early years, Pierre Karlstr\u00f6m. Neumann also has showed her loyalty to her first golf club by, three times during the peak of her career in the 90ths, inviting some of the female golf stars of the world, [[Laura Davies]], [[Karrie Webb]], [[Kelly Robbins]] and [[Jane Geddes]] among others, for exhibition matches in Finsp\u00e5ng.<ref>[https://www.finspangsgk.se/se/klubb/historia/lotta-neumann Lotta Neumann] ''Finsp\u00e5ngs Golfklubb'' Historia</ref>\n\n==Amateur career==\nIn 1981, only 15 years of age, she sensationally won the Swedish International Amateur Stroke-Play Championship, one of three major amateur tournaments in Sweden at the time, at J\u00f6nk\u00f6ping Golf Club, with a record aggregate of 282 and a 9-stroke margin. She bettered her personal 72-hole best with 30 strokes and beat the whole Swedish amateur national team, of which some did not even had heard of Neumann before the tournament.

Her father Rune was a former football player and coach of a local girls football team. After practicing different sports and supported by her father, her mother Ingegerd and her brother Mats, Neumann begun playing golf at the local 9-hole course at Finsp\u00e5ng Golf Club, founded in 1965. She showed early promise and won the unofficial national youth championships, Colgate Cup, in three different levels, as a 12-, 14-, and 16-year old. Neumann has later given a lot of credit, for her successful career, to her local coach since her early years, Pierre Karlstr\u00f6m. Neumann also has showed her loyalty to her first golf club by, three times during the peak of her career in the 90ths, inviting some of the female golf stars of the world, [[Laura Davies]], [[Karrie Webb]], [[Kelly Robbins]] and [[Jane Geddes]] among others, for exhibition matches in Finsp\u00e5ng.<ref>[https://www.finspangsgk.se/se/klubb/historia/lotta-neumann Lotta Neumann] ''Finsp\u00e5ngs Golfklubb'' Historia</ref>\n\n==Amateur career==\nIn 1981, only 15 years of age, she sensationally won the Swedish International Amateur Stroke-Play Championship, one of three major amateur tournaments in Sweden at the time, at J\u00f6nk\u00f6ping Golf Club, with a record aggregate of 282 and a 9-stroke margin. She bettered her personal 72-hole best with 30 strokes and beat the whole Swedish amateur national team, of which some did not even had heard of Neumann before the tournament. At the time of her triumph, she wasn't even qualified for the Swedish national junior team, which, the same summer, won the European Lady Junior's Team Championship.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite magazine |url=http://www.http://www.e-magin.se/paper/tnvx7xpn/paper |title=J\u00f6sse Lotta, vilken skr\u00e4ll |language=Swedish |magazine=Svensk Golf |date=July 1981 |pages=25\u201327, 64}}</ref>\n\nThe year after, she successfully defended her stroke-play title and,16 years old, was a member of the national team at the [[Espirito Santo Trophy]] in Geneva, Switzerland.

She won five times in [[Japan]] and the 1995 [[Holden Women's Australian Open|Women's Australian Open]]. Her victory in the 1994 [[Women's British Open|Women\u2019s British Open]] made her the fifth player to win both British and U.S. Open titles, joining [[Laura Davies]], [[Jane Geddes]], [[Betsy King]] and [[Patty Sheehan]].

It is the headquarter of [[Chiplun taluka]] and located on the [[Mumbai]]\u2013[[Goa]] highway (NH-66) (it was earlier numbered as NH-17) in western [[India]]. The city is about 320&nbsp;km south of Mumbai in the Konkan region of Maharashtra. It is a fast developing city in [[Konkan]] with a strong cultural background. The name ''Chiplun'' means \"The abode of Lord [[Parshuram]].\"\n\n== Geography ==\nThe city lies near the source of the [[River Vashishti]]. To the east of the city lie the [[Western Ghats]] and to the west lies [[Guhagar Beach|Guhagar]] taluka which was carved out of Chiplun taluka. The region has a tropical climate. The 'rainy season' \u2014 the [[monsoon]] lasts normally from June until October. The Koyna Hydroelectric Power Project Stages III and IV are situated near Chiplun.\n\n== History ==\nChiplun was believed to have the first home of the Konkanasth or [[Chitpavan]] Brahmans. According to local folklore, after claiming Konkan region from aggressive sea, people were supplied with sixty ponds and sixty gardens by ''Parashuram''.\n\nChiplun was initially ruled by the Satavahanas, Shakas, Kshatrapas, Kalachuris and Rashtrakutas. Later it was invaded by the Kadambas & Traikutas followed by the Delhi Sultanate, Marathas and Peshwas majorly.\n\nIn the seventeenth century it was a great village, very populous and plentifully stored with all provisions. The nearby [[Gowalkot]] was the trade center being the major harbour over Vashishthi River. The ''Paag'' area in town was named so because it was mainly used for war horse stables. The central area in Chiplun, called Markandi, is believed to have taken name from the Yadnya performed there by ''Maharshi Markandeya''.\n\nIn the recent history, when Chhatrapati [[Shivaji]] took over Konkan and established his rein, he won the Gowalkot fort in 1660 and renamed it as ''Govindagad''. During the times of Maratha Empire Chiplun was halting place when travelling towards upper ghat regions of Satara. Shivaji came to Gowalkoat fort in Chiplun to take an update of his Arm forces before going for his coronation at Raigad.\n\nChiplun was taken over later on by means of fort battles including Sambhaji, Tulaj Angre, Chimaji Appa, and Siddi Sat, before taken up by a body of Ramoshis in 1818, but abandoned on the approach of British forces.\n\nDuring this time Bajirao Peshwa, who for some years (1812-1815) came down the Kumbharli pass to visit his palace at Guhagar near Dabhol, built a rest house for himself which is now used as a Government office.\n\n== Demographics ==\nAt the 2011 India [[census]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.censusindia.net/results/town.php?stad=A&state5=999|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040616075334/http://www.censusindia.net/results/town.php?stad=A&state5=999|archivedate=2004-06-16|title= Census of India 2001: Data from the 2001 Census, including cities, villages and towns  (Provisional)|accessdate=2008-11-01|publisher= Census Commission of India}}</ref> Chiplun had a population of 55,139 of which 27,355 are males while 27,784 are females as per report released by Census India 2011.

College are the some of oldest educational institutes in the town catering the need for the [[taluka]]. The town has its own cinema theatre named Pooja Theatre. The city is close to MIDC, Lote which was the Asia's biggest chemical zone in the last decade.\n\nSince the city is on a busy National Highway, it also caters to travellers en route to Goa and Mumbai. It is also a junction for those travelling to the [[Dabhol]] (a shipyard near Chiplun), where a project, 'Sangla Buggla' failed. This led to a rise in local unemployment and created a vacuum among young people during that time. The town links the western coast to the interior parts of Maharashtra.\n\nChiplun was severely devastated in the [[2005 Maharashtra floods]], when 300&nbsp;mm rain fell on 25 July 2005.\n\nIt is a land of traders; it trades in groceries, kokams (red colour fruit, [[Garcinia indica]]) and kokam juices. It also has a great crop of mangoes as it falls in Ratnagiri district which is known for King of Mangoes, [[Alphonso (mango)|Alphonso]].{{citation needed|date=April 2019}} The city has its own \u2018TAJ\u2019 Hotel developed first in Maharashtra near riverview and it is now known as \"Quality Resort The Riverview\".

It is the headquarter of [[Chiplun taluka]] and located on the [[Mumbai]]\u2013[[Goa]] highway (NH-66) (it was earlier numbered as NH-17) in western [[India]]. The city is about 320&nbsp;km south of Mumbai in the Konkan region of Maharashtra. It is a fast developing city in [[Konkan]] with a strong cultural background. The name ''Chiplun'' means \"The abode of Lord [[Parshuram]].\"\n\n== Geography ==\nThe city lies near the source of the [[River Vashishti]]. To the east of the city lie the [[Western Ghats]] and to the west lies [[Guhagar Beach|Guhagar]] taluka which was carved out of Chiplun taluka. The region has a tropical climate. The 'rainy season' \u2014 the [[monsoon]] lasts normally from June until October. The Koyna Hydroelectric Power Project Stages III and IV are situated near Chiplun.\n\n== History ==\nChiplun was believed to have the first home of the Konkanasth or [[Chitpavan]] Brahmans. According to local folklore, after claiming Konkan region from aggressive sea, people were supplied with sixty ponds and sixty gardens by ''Parashuram''.\n\nChiplun was initially ruled by the Satavahanas, Shakas, Kshatrapas, Kalachuris and Rashtrakutas. Later it was invaded by the Kadambas & Traikutas followed by the Delhi Sultanate, Marathas and Peshwas majorly.\n\nIn the seventeenth century it was a great village, very populous and plentifully stored with all provisions. The nearby [[Gowalkot]] was the trade center being the major harbour over Vashishthi River. The ''Paag'' area in town was named so because it was mainly used for war horse stables. The central area in Chiplun, called Markandi, is believed to have taken name from the Yadnya performed there by ''Maharshi Markandeya''.\n\nIn the recent history, when Chhatrapati [[Shivaji]] took over Konkan and established his rein, he won the Gowalkot fort in 1660 and renamed it as ''Govindagad''. During the times of Maratha Empire Chiplun was halting place when travelling towards upper ghat regions of Satara. Shivaji came to Gowalkoat fort in Chiplun to take an update of his Arm forces before going for his coronation at Raigad.\n\nChiplun was taken over later on by means of fort battles including Sambhaji, Tulaj Angre, Chimaji Appa, and Siddi Sat, before taken up by a body of Ramoshis in 1818, but abandoned on the approach of British forces.\n\nDuring this time Bajirao Peshwa, who for some years (1812-1815) came down the Kumbharli pass to visit his palace at Guhagar near Dabhol, built a rest house for himself which is now used as a Government office.\n\n== Demographics ==\nAt the 2011 India [[census]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.censusindia.net/results/town.php?stad=A&state5=999|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040616075334/http://www.censusindia.net/results/town.php?stad=A&state5=999|archivedate=2004-06-16|title= Census of India 2001: Data from the 2001 Census, including cities, villages and towns  (Provisional)|accessdate=2008-11-01|publisher= Census Commission of India}}</ref> Chiplun had a population of 55,139 of which 27,355 are males while 27,784 are females as per report released by Census India 2011.

College are the some of oldest educational institutes in the town catering the need for the [[taluka]]. The town has its own cinema theatre named Pooja Theatre. The city is close to MIDC, Lote which was the Asia's biggest chemical zone in the last decade.\n\nSince the city is on a busy National Highway, it also caters to travellers en route to Goa and Mumbai. It is also a junction for those travelling to the [[Dabhol]] (a shipyard near Chiplun), where a project, 'Sangla Buggla' failed. This led to a rise in local unemployment and created a vacuum among young people during that time. The town links the western coast to the interior parts of Maharashtra.\n\nChiplun was severely devastated in the [[2005 Maharashtra floods]], when 300&nbsp;mm rain fell on 25 July 2005.\n\nIt is a land of traders; it trades in groceries, kokams (red colour fruit, [[Garcinia indica]]) and kokam juices. It also has a great crop of mangoes as it falls in Ratnagiri district which is known for King of Mangoes, [[Alphonso (mango)|Alphonso]].{{citation needed|date=April 2019}} The city has its own \u2018TAJ\u2019 Hotel developed first in Maharashtra near riverview and it is now known as \"Quality Resort The Riverview\".
