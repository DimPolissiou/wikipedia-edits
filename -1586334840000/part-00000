East of the entrance and north of the Parthenon is the temple known as the [[Erechtheum]]. South of the platform that forms the top of the Acropolis there are also the remains of the ancient, though often remodelled, [[Theatre of Dionysus]]. A few hundred metres away, there is the now partially reconstructed [[Odeon of Herodes Atticus]].<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Hadingham |first=Evan |date=February 2008 |title=Unlocking Mysteries of the Parthenon |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history-archaeology/Unlocking-Mysteries-of-the-Parthenon.html |magazine=Smithsonian}}</ref>\n\nAll the valuable ancient artifacts are situated in the [[Acropolis Museum]], which resides on the southern slope of the same rock, 280 metres from the Parthenon.<ref>[http://www.theacropolismuseum.gr/en \"The Acropolis Museum\"].

The goal of the restoration was to reverse the decay of centuries of attrition, pollution, destruction stemming from military use, and misguided past restorations. The project included collection and identification of all stone fragments, even small ones, from the Acropolis and its slopes and the attempt was made to restore as much as possible using reassembled original material ([[anastylosis]]), with new marble from [[Mount Pentelicus]] used sparingly. All restoration was made using [[titanium]] dowels and is designed to be completely reversible, in case future experts decide to change things. A combination of cutting-edge modern technology and extensive research and reinvention of ancient techniques were used.<ref name=umich>[http://www.lsa.umich.edu/UMICH/modgreek/Home/Window%20to%20Greek%20Culture/Lectures%20at%20U-M/LaUM_Mallouchou_restorationacropolis.pdf Fani Mallouchou-Tufano, \"The Restoration of the Athenian Acropolis\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121202215359/http://www.lsa.umich.edu/UMICH/modgreek/Home/Window%20to%20Greek%20Culture/Lectures%20at%20U-M/LaUM_Mallouchou_restorationacropolis.pdf |date=2012-12-02 }}, University of Michigan.

During the festival, a procession (believed to be depicted on the Parthenon frieze) traveled through the city via the Panathenaic Way and culminated on the Acropolis. There, a new robe of woven wool (''[[peplos]]'') was placed on either the statue of Athena Polias in the Erechtheum (during the annual Lesser Panathenaea) or on the statue of [[Athena Parthenos]] in the Parthenon (during the Great Panathenaea, held every four years).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://depthome.brooklyn.cuny.edu/classics/dunkle/athnlife/rligious.htm |title=Panathenaic Festical |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120427153119/http://depthome.brooklyn.cuny.edu/classics/dunkle/athnlife/rligious.htm |archivedate=2012-04-27 }}</ref>\n\nWithin the later tradition of [[Western Civilization]] and [[classicism|classical revival]], the Acropolis, from at least the mid-18th century on, has often been invoked as a key symbol of the Greek legacy and of the glories of [[Classical Greece]].\n\n== Geology ==\nThe Acropolis is a [[klippe]] consisting of two lithostratiagraphic units, the Athens [[schist]] and the overlying Acropolis [[limestone]]. The Athens schist is a soft reddish rock dating from the upper [[Cretaceous]]. The original sediments were deposited in a river delta approximately 70 million years ago. The Acropolis limestone dates from the upper [[Jurassic]] period, predating the underlying Athens schist by 30 million years. The Acropolis limestone was thrust over the Athens schist by compressional tectonic forces, forming a [[nappe]] or overthrust sheet. Erosion of the limestone nappe led to the eventual detachment of the Acropolis, forming the present day feature. Many of the hills in the Athens region were formed by the erosion of the same nappe as the Acropolis. These include the hills of [[Mount Lycabettus|Lykabettos]], [[Areopagus]], and [[Mouseion Hill|Mouseion]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Regueiro y Gonz\u00e1lez-Barros|first=Manuel|last2=Stamatakis|first2=Michael|last3=Laskaridis|first3=Konstantinos|date=2014-11-30|title=The geology of the Acropolis (Athens, Greece)|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/269076024_The_geology_of_the_Acropolis_Athens_Greece|journal=European Geologist|volume=38|pages=45\u201352}}</ref> The marble utilized to construct the buildings of the Acropolis was sourced from the quarries of [[Mount Pentelicus]], a mountain to the northeast of the city.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.artofmaking.ac.uk/explore/materials/8/Pentelic-Marble|title=Material: Pentelic Marble |publisher= Art of Making|website=www.artofmaking.ac.uk|access-date=2018-12-13}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Landscaping of the Acropolis of Athens]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book\n| last                  = Andronicos\n| first                 = Manolis\n| title                 = The Acropolis \n| publisher             = Ekdotike Athenon S.A.\n| year                  = 2005\n| isbn                  = 978-960-213-006-3\n}}\n* {{cite book\n| last1                 = Bouras \n| first1                = Charalampos\n| last2                 = Ioannidou\n| first2                = Maria \n| last3                 = Jenkins\n| first3                = Ian\n| title                 = Acropolis Restored\n| publisher             = British Museum Press\n| year                  = 2012\n| isbn                  = 978-0-86159-187-9\n}}\n* {{cite book|last=Brouskar\u0113|first=Maria S.|title=The monuments of the Acropolis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gj5oAAAAMAAJ|year=1997|publisher=Ministry of Culture, Archeological Receipts Fund|isbn=978-960-214-158-8}}\n* Cohen, Beth.

The goal of the restoration was to reverse the decay of centuries of attrition, pollution, destruction stemming from military use, and misguided past restorations. The project included collection and identification of all stone fragments, even small ones, from the Acropolis and its slopes and the attempt was made to restore as much as possible using reassembled original material ([[anastylosis]]), with new marble from [[Mount Pentelicus]] used sparingly. All restoration was made using [[titanium]] dowels and is designed to be completely reversible, in case future experts decide to change things. A combination of cutting-edge modern technology and extensive research and reinvention of ancient techniques were used.<ref name=umich>[http://www.lsa.umich.edu/UMICH/modgreek/Home/Window%20to%20Greek%20Culture/Lectures%20at%20U-M/LaUM_Mallouchou_restorationacropolis.pdf Fani Mallouchou-Tufano, \"The Restoration of the Athenian Acropolis\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121202215359/http://www.lsa.umich.edu/UMICH/modgreek/Home/Window%20to%20Greek%20Culture/Lectures%20at%20U-M/LaUM_Mallouchou_restorationacropolis.pdf |date=2012-12-02 }}, University of Michigan.

During the festival, a procession (believed to be depicted on the Parthenon frieze) traveled through the city via the Panathenaic Way and culminated on the Acropolis. There, a new robe of woven wool (''[[peplos]]'') was placed on either the statue of Athena Polias in the Erechtheum (during the annual Lesser Panathenaea) or on the statue of [[Athena Parthenos]] in the Parthenon (during the Great Panathenaea, held every four years).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://depthome.brooklyn.cuny.edu/classics/dunkle/athnlife/rligious.htm |title=Panathenaic Festical |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120427153119/http://depthome.brooklyn.cuny.edu/classics/dunkle/athnlife/rligious.htm |archivedate=2012-04-27 }}</ref>\n\nWithin the later tradition of [[Western Civilization]] and [[classicism|classical revival]], the Acropolis, from at least the mid-18th century on, has often been invoked as a key symbol of the Greek legacy and of the glories of [[Classical Greece]].\n\n== Geology ==\nThe Acropolis is a [[klippe]] consisting of two lithostratiagraphic units, the Athens [[schist]] and the overlying Acropolis [[limestone]]. The Athens schist is a soft reddish rock dating from the upper [[Cretaceous]]. The original sediments were deposited in a river delta approximately 70 million years ago. The Acropolis limestone dates from the upper [[Jurassic]] period, predating the underlying Athens schist by 30 million years. The Acropolis limestone was thrust over the Athens schist by compressional tectonic forces, forming a [[nappe]] or overthrust sheet. Erosion of the limestone nappe led to the eventual detachment of the Acropolis, forming the present day feature. Many of the hills in the Athens region were formed by the erosion of the same nappe as the Acropolis. These include the hills of [[Mount Lycabettus|Lykabettos]], [[Areopagus]], and [[Mouseion Hill|Mouseion]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Regueiro y Gonz\u00e1lez-Barros|first=Manuel|last2=Stamatakis|first2=Michael|last3=Laskaridis|first3=Konstantinos|date=2014-11-30|title=The geology of the Acropolis (Athens, Greece)|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/269076024_The_geology_of_the_Acropolis_Athens_Greece|journal=European Geologist|volume=38|pages=45\u201352}}</ref> The marble utilized to construct the buildings of the Acropolis was sourced from the quarries of [[Mount Pentelicus]], a mountain to the northeast of the city.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.artofmaking.ac.uk/explore/materials/8/Pentelic-Marble|title=Material: Pentelic Marble |publisher= Art of Making|website=www.artofmaking.ac.uk|access-date=2018-12-13}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Landscaping of the Acropolis of Athens]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book\n| last                  = Andronicos\n| first                 = Manolis\n| title                 = The Acropolis \n| publisher             = Ekdotike Athenon S.A.\n| year                  = 2005\n| isbn                  = 978-960-213-006-3\n}}\n* {{cite book\n| last1                 = Bouras \n| first1                = Charalampos\n| last2                 = Ioannidou\n| first2                = Maria \n| last3                 = Jenkins\n| first3                = Ian\n| title                 = Acropolis Restored\n| publisher             = British Museum Press\n| year                  = 2012\n| isbn                  = 978-0-86159-187-9\n}}\n* {{cite book|last=Brouskar\u0113|first=Maria S.|title=The monuments of the Acropolis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gj5oAAAAMAAJ|year=1997|publisher=Ministry of Culture, Archeological Receipts Fund|isbn=978-960-214-158-8}}\n* Cohen, Beth.

The film was produced by the Caucaso Factory production company and directed by Enrico Masi. The film mainly follows two individuals and their experiences in the run up to the World Cup and then the Olympics, which culminate in the eviction and demolition of the Vila Aut\u00f3dromo social community and the dispossession of the Universidade Indigena, or Indigenous University, based in the [[Maracan\u00e3 Village|Aldeia Maracan\u00e3]].\n\nThe film is narrated in [[French language|French]] by Marie Christine Elekes but is otherwise in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] with [[English language|English]] [[Subtitle (captioning)|subtitles]].\n\n== Title ==\nThe film's title is taken from a 17th-century [[Millenarianism|millenarianist]] book of the same name written by Portuguese [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] [[Ant\u00f3nio Vieira|Antonio Vieria]] (1608\u20131697) who dedicated his life to the [[Evangelism|evangelisation]] of the indigenous peoples of Brazil. His book prophesied the rise of the Brazilian Empire to be the world's fifth great civilisation, after the [[Assyria]]n, [[Persian Empire|Persian]], [[Rise of Macedon|Greek]] and [[Roman Empire|Roman]] empires. The film references the book and its historical context to highlight the ongoing forced [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]] of Brazil indigenous communities and the marginalisation of indigenous culture.\n\n==Synopsis==\nThe film mainly follows two individuals, Inalva Mendes Brito and Urutau Guajajara, placed at the heart of the negative impacts that resulted from the policies of the [[Federal government of Brazil|Brazilian government]], [[FIFA]] and the [[International Olympic Committee|IOC]] in the run up to Rio de Janeiro's World Cup and Olympic Games.\n\nInalva Mendes Brito is a teacher who lived in the Vila Aut\u00f3dromo, a semi-autonomous community that emerged in the 1970s as a result of a fishermen's colony on Rio de Janeiro's periphery merging with various groups of [[Syndicalism|syndicalists]] who had been persecuted by the [[Brazilian military government|military dictatorship]]. The Vila Aut\u00f3dromo, which won the Urban Age Award for best conciliation project in 2013, was demolished in June 2015 to make way for the [[Rio 2016 Olympic Village|Olympic Park]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/03/forced-evictions-vila-autodromo-rio-olympics-protests|title=Forced evictions in Rio favela for 2016 Olympics trigger violent clashes|last=Watts|first=Jonathan|date=2015-06-03|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2017-01-13}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.db.com/cr/en/concrete-Urban-Age-Award-2013.htm|title=Urban Age Award 2013 \u2013 Deutsche Bank Responsibility \u2013 Deutsche Bank Responsibility|website=www.db.com|access-date=2017-01-13}}</ref> In the film, Mendes Brito stresses the insignificance of financial compensation and the audience witness the emotional moment when she revisits the pile of rubble that used to be her home for the first time since her eviction.\n\nUrutau Guajajara is an indigenous Brazilian [[Linguistics|linguist]] and figurehead of the Universidade Indigena, which is dedicated to the protection of native culture. The film follows his struggle to hold on to his indigenous identity and his eventual eviction from the Aldeia Maracan\u00e3, or [[Maracan\u00e3 Village]], home of the Indigenous University inside the former Museo do Indio (a derelict colonial palace just beside the [[Maracan\u00e3 Stadium]]), prior to the World Cup.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://hyperallergic.com/67768/brazil-evicts-indigenous-people-in-violent-clash-over-sports-stadium/|title=Brazil Evicts Indigenous People in Violent Clash Over Sports Stadium|date=2013-04-01|newspaper=Hyperallergic|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-13}}</ref>\n\nThe film also makes use of interviews with several other Brazilians, both indigenous and European, as well as footage of the Brazilian [[Teacher|educator]] and [[philosopher]], [[Paulo Freire]], at the [[University of Bologna]] in 1989, who explores the significance of language in identity and the role of violence in the relationship between oppressed and oppressor.\n\n==Themes==\n''Hist\u00f3ria do Futuro'' stresses the concept of \u2018neutralisation' i.e. the Brazilian government's attempts to disempower indigenous and impoverished communities via [[oppression]] and/or assimilation.

The film was produced by the Caucaso Factory production company and directed by Enrico Masi. The film mainly follows two individuals and their experiences in the run up to the World Cup and then the Olympics, which culminate in the eviction and demolition of the Vila Aut\u00f3dromo social community and the dispossession of the Universidade Indigena, or Indigenous University, based in the [[Maracan\u00e3 Village|Aldeia Maracan\u00e3]].\n\nThe film is narrated in [[French language|French]] by Marie Christine Elekes but is otherwise in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] with [[English language|English]] [[Subtitle (captioning)|subtitles]].\n\n== Title ==\nThe film's title is taken from a 17th-century [[Millenarianism|millenarianist]] book of the same name written by Portuguese [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] [[Ant\u00f3nio Vieira|Antonio Vieria]] (1608\u20131697) who dedicated his life to the [[Evangelism|evangelisation]] of the indigenous peoples of Brazil. His book prophesied the rise of the Brazilian Empire to be the world's fifth great civilisation, after the [[Assyria]]n, [[Persian Empire|Persian]], [[Rise of Macedon|Greek]] and [[Roman Empire|Roman]] empires. The film references the book and its historical context to highlight the ongoing forced [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]] of Brazil indigenous communities and the marginalisation of indigenous culture.\n\n==Synopsis==\nThe film mainly follows two individuals, Inalva Mendes Brito and Urutau Guajajara, placed at the heart of the negative impacts that resulted from the policies of the [[Federal government of Brazil|Brazilian government]], [[FIFA]] and the [[International Olympic Committee|IOC]] in the run up to Rio de Janeiro's World Cup and Olympic Games.\n\nInalva Mendes Brito is a teacher who lived in the Vila Aut\u00f3dromo, a semi-autonomous community that emerged in the 1970s as a result of a fishermen's colony on Rio de Janeiro's periphery merging with various groups of [[Syndicalism|syndicalists]] who had been persecuted by the [[Brazilian military government|military dictatorship]]. The Vila Aut\u00f3dromo, which won the Urban Age Award for best conciliation project in 2013, was demolished in June 2015 to make way for the [[Rio 2016 Olympic Village|Olympic Park]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/03/forced-evictions-vila-autodromo-rio-olympics-protests|title=Forced evictions in Rio favela for 2016 Olympics trigger violent clashes|last=Watts|first=Jonathan|date=2015-06-03|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2017-01-13}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.db.com/cr/en/concrete-Urban-Age-Award-2013.htm|title=Urban Age Award 2013 \u2013 Deutsche Bank Responsibility \u2013 Deutsche Bank Responsibility|website=www.db.com|access-date=2017-01-13}}</ref> In the film, Mendes Brito stresses the insignificance of financial compensation and the audience witness the emotional moment when she revisits the pile of rubble that used to be her home for the first time since her eviction.\n\nUrutau Guajajara is an indigenous Brazilian [[Linguistics|linguist]] and figurehead of the Universidade Indigena, which is dedicated to the protection of native culture. The film follows his struggle to hold on to his indigenous identity and his eventual eviction from the Aldeia Maracan\u00e3, or [[Maracan\u00e3 Village]], home of the Indigenous University inside the former Museo do Indio (a derelict colonial palace just beside the [[Maracan\u00e3 Stadium]]), prior to the World Cup.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://hyperallergic.com/67768/brazil-evicts-indigenous-people-in-violent-clash-over-sports-stadium/|title=Brazil Evicts Indigenous People in Violent Clash Over Sports Stadium|date=2013-04-01|newspaper=Hyperallergic|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-13}}</ref>\n\nThe film also makes use of interviews with several other Brazilians, both indigenous and European, as well as footage of the Brazilian [[Teacher|educator]] and [[philosopher]], [[Paulo Freire]], at the [[University of Bologna]] in 1989, who explores the significance of language in identity and the role of violence in the relationship between oppressed and oppressor.\n\n==Themes==\n''Hist\u00f3ria do Futuro'' stresses the concept of \u2018neutralisation' i.e. the Brazilian government's attempts to disempower indigenous and impoverished communities via [[oppression]] and/or assimilation.

W. Harper]], is one of the first novels published by an [[African American|African-American]] woman. While following what has been termed the \"sentimental\" conventions of late nineteenth-century writing about women, it also deals with serious social issues of education for women, [[Passing (racial identity)|passing]], [[miscegenation]], [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolition]], [[Reconstruction era (United States)|reconstruction]], [[Temperance movement|temperance]], and social responsibility.\n\n==Characters==\n[[File:Iola Leroy Frontispiece.jpg|351x351px|thumb|left|Frances Harper on the book's [[frontispiece]]]]\n\n===Iola Leroy and family===\n'''Iola Leroy''', the principal character of the novel.\n\n'''Harriet Johnson''', Iola Leroy's grandmother. While a slave of Nancy Johnson, she resists a whipping. As a punishment, she is sold.\n\n'''Robert Johnson'''. He is still a child when separated from his mother Harriet. His enslaver, Nancy Johnson, sees him as a \"pet animal\" (chapter 1) and teaches him to read. As a young man, he becomes the leader of a group of slaves who decide to seek refuge with the Union army during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. He enlists in a colored regiment and is promoted to lieutenant. On account of his white skin, his superiors council him to change to a white regiment for better chances of promotion, but he refuses. After the war, he successfully runs a hardware store.\n\n'''Marie Leroy''', Iola's mother. A small child when brutally separated from her mother Harriet Johnson, she finally becomes the slave of wealthy Eugene Leroy. When Eugene becomes seriously ill, she nurses him back to health. He sets her free, has her educated and marries her in a secret ceremony. Although she is so white that \"no one would suspect that she has one drop of negro blood in her veins\" (chapter IX), the marriage results in the Leroy family becoming social outcasts.\n\n'''Harry Leroy''', Iola's brother. Like Iola, he is educated in a North. The African ancestry of their mother is concealed from the children, and they are not allowed to pass their vacations at home, spending that time instead together with the parents in a northern holiday resort. When he learns that his father has died and his mother and sister are enslaved, he becomes seriously ill from the shock. When he recovers, the Civil War has begun and he decides to enlist in a colored regiment, making the recruiting officer wonder why a white man should want to do that.\n\n'''Dr. Frank Latimer''', the man who Iola finally marries. He was born into slavery as the son of an enslaved mother of predominantly European ancestry and a white man. After emancipation, his mother invested her hard earnings to pay for his studies. He graduated as a medical doctor and afterwards met his white grandmother, the rich mother of his deceased father, who offered to \"adopt him as her heir, if he would ignore his identity with the colored race\" (chapter XXVIII). Although no trace of his African ancestry was visible in his appearance, he declined the offer.\n\n'''Lucille Delany''', the woman who Harry finally marries.\n\n===Other black characters===\n'''Tom Anderson''', friend of Robert Johnson. He seeks refuge with the Union army together with Johnson, causes the commander to set Iola free, joins the army and dies in Iola's care from wounds he received while knowingly sacrificing himself in order to save his comrades.\n\n'''Aunt Linda''', enslaved cook of Nancy Johnson who has a special liking for Robert.\n\n'''Uncle Daniel''', elder friend of Robert Johnson. When Robert and his group seek refuge with the Union army, he stays behind because he doesn't want to break his promise to his absent master.\n\n===White characters===\n'''Dr. Gresham''', military physician. He falls in love with Iola while he still thinks that she is white. When informed that she is \"colored\", his love helps him to overcome his prejudice, and he proposes to Iola at two different points of the story. When rejected for the second time, \"sympathy, love, and admiration were blended in the parting look he gave her\" (chapter 27).\n\n'''Dr. Latrobe''', physician from the South. He is mentioned only in chapters 26, ''Open Questions'', and 28, ''Dr. Latrobe's Mistake''. In a discussion, he voices the view of southern [[White supremacy|white supremacists]].\n\n==Plot summary==\nIn a [[North Carolina]] town which is only identified as \"C\u2014\", a group of slaves led by Robert Johnson seek refuge with the Union army that is approaching in the course of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. Robert's friend Tom Anderson then informs the Union commander of a beautiful young woman held as slave in the neighborhood who is subsequently set free by the commander.\n\nIn a retrospective, the narrative turns to the story of that woman, Iola Leroy. Her father, Eugene Leroy, was a wealthy slaveholder, who had survived a serious illness through the care of a young slave, Marie. He set Marie free, married her and had three children, whose African ancestry was not visible in their outward appearance. The elder children, Ioala and Harry, were educated in the North and their African ancestry (called \"negro blood\" in the book) was hidden from them. When Eugene suddenly died of yellow fever, his cousin, Alfred Lorraine, had a judge declare Marie's manumission illegal. Hence, Marie and her children were legally considered slaves and the heritage fell to Lorraine and other distant relatives. Lorraine sent his agent to the northern seminary where Iola was preparing for her graduation and defending the institution of slavery in discussions with her fellow students. Deceitfully being told that her father was dying, Iola followed the agent to her home, where she learned that she was a slave and was sold away from her mother.\n\nThe narrative then returns to the events following Iola's rescue by the Union army: Robert Johnson and Tom Anderson join the army \"to strike a blow for freedom\", while Iola becomes a nurse in a military hospital. When Robert is entrusted to her care after being wounded, they tell each other their stories which indicate that Robert is the brother of Iola's mother. After the war, they return to \"C\u2014\" to search for Robert's mother, who they recognize when she tells her story during a prayer meeting.\n\nThe family is reunited when they locate Harry who had been fighting in the Union army and met with his and Iola's mother during the war.\n\n==Themes==\nMuch space is given to discussions in which the characters talk about themes such as [[Temperance movement|temperance]], religion, the position of women in society, alleged white superiority, racism and lynchings, and the color line.\n\n'''Temperance''': The damaging effects of alcohol are often discussed in the book. For example, after the war the black characters tell each other of two former masters who took to drink and ended up in the \"[[poorhouse|pore-house]]\" (chapters 18, 19). After Robert Johnson has found his long-lost mother, Aunt Linda pours three glasses of her home-made wine so they can celebrate the event. Robert refuses the wine stating, \"I'm a temperance man\", causing the conversion of Aunt Linda to the temperance idea (chapter 20).\n\n'''Religion''': Prayer plays an important role in the life of the black characters: Iola and Robert discover the first clue of their kinship when Iola sings a special hymn at the bedside of the wounded Robert, which he has learned from his mother (chapter 16). Both find Harriet, their lost grandmother and mother, during a prayer meeting (chapter 20).\n\nWhen Iola's brother Harry learns that his mother and sister have been reduced to slavery, he asks how such a thing is possible in a \"Christian country\". The principal of his school gives the answer: \"Christian in name\" (chapter 14). After the war and the abolition of slavery, in a discussion with her uncle Robert and Dr. Gresham, Iola states that a \"fuller comprehension of the claims of the Gospel of Jesus Christ and their application to our national life\" is the only \"remedy by which our nation can recover from the evil entailed upon her by slavery\", to which both Robert and Gresham agree (chapter 25).\n\nIn the discussions, the characters also mention [[Islam]]. The black pastor, ''Rev. Carmicle'', speaks of the \"imperfect creed\" of \"Mohammedanism\" (chapter 26), but ''Prof. Gradnor'', a black professor from North Carolina, sees Islamic countries as \"civilized\" and compares them favorably with the southern United States, referring to lynchings and stating, \"I know of no civilized country on the globe, Catholic, Protestant, or Mohammedan, where life is less secure than it is in the South\" (chapter 30).\n\n'''Alleged white superiority''': In chapter 17, Iola is teaching black children, when a \"gentleman\" asks to address the class. He talks about the \"achievements of the white race\" and then asks \"how they did it.\" {{quote|\u2033They've got the money,\u2033 chorused the children.\n\u2033But how did they get it ?\u2033\n\u2033They took it from us,\u2033 chimed the youngsters.}}\n\n==Literary significance and criticism==\n''Iola Leroy'' \"may well have [been] influenced\" by [[Harriet Jacobs]]'s 1861 autobiography ''[[Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl]]''.<ref name=\"JacobsXXXI\">J.F.Yellin, Introduction to: H.Jacobs, Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl. Ed. J.F.Yellin, Cambridge 2000, p. xxxi.</ref>\n\n''Iola Leroy'' was for some time cited as the first novel by an African-American author.  Professor [[Henry Louis Gates, Jr.]]'s 1982 discovery of [[Harriet Wilson]]'s ''[[Our Nig]]'' (1859) displaced it from that spot. Later, [[William Wells Brown]]'s 1853 novel ''[[Clotel]], or the President's Daughter'', although first published in England where he was living at the time, came to be viewed as the first novel by an African-American author.\n\nHarper's novel remains important as one of the earliest novels written by an African American and as a fictional work dealing with complex issues of race, class, and politics in the United States. Recent scholarship suggests that Harper's novel provides a sophisticated understanding of citizenship, gender, and community, particularly the way that African Americans developed hybrid forms of ''[[Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft|gemeinschaft and gesellschaft]]'' before, during, and after slavery.<ref>[[Hollis Robbins|Robbins, Hollis]] (ed.), \"Introduction,\" ''Iola Leroy, or, Shadows Uplifted,'' Penguin Classics, 2010.</ref>\n\nThe African-American journalist [[Ida B.

He talks about the \"achievements of the white race\" and then asks \"how they did it.\" {{quote|\u2033They've got the money,\u2033 chorused the children.\n\u2033But how did they get it ?\u2033\n\u2033They took it from us,\u2033 chimed the youngsters.}}\n\n==Literary significance and criticism==\n''Iola Leroy'' \"may well have [been] influenced\" by [[Harriet Jacobs]]'s 1861 autobiography ''[[Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl]]''.<ref name=\"JacobsXXXI\">J.F.Yellin, Introduction to: H.Jacobs, Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl. Ed. J.F.Yellin, Cambridge 2000, p. xxxi.</ref>\n\n''Iola Leroy'' was for some time cited as the first novel by an African-American author.  Professor [[Henry Louis Gates, Jr.]]'s 1982 discovery of [[Harriet Wilson]]'s ''[[Our Nig]]'' (1859) displaced it from that spot. Later, [[William Wells Brown]]'s 1853 novel ''[[Clotel]], or the President's Daughter'', although first published in England where he was living at the time, came to be viewed as the first novel by an African-American author.\n\nHarper's novel remains important as one of the earliest novels written by an African American and as a fictional work dealing with complex issues of race, class, and politics in the United States. Recent scholarship suggests that Harper's novel provides a sophisticated understanding of citizenship, gender, and community, particularly the way that African Americans developed hybrid forms of ''[[Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft|gemeinschaft and gesellschaft]]'' before, during, and after slavery.<ref>[[Hollis Robbins|Robbins, Hollis]] (ed.), \"Introduction,\" ''Iola Leroy, or, Shadows Uplifted,'' Penguin Classics, 2010.</ref>\n\nThe African-American journalist [[Ida B.

The defending champion is [[Stockfish (chess)|Stockfish]], which defeated [[AllieStein]] in the [[TCEC Season 16]] superfinal.\n\nSeason 17 featured for the first time two separate leagues, one for [[GPU]]-based engines and one for [[CPU]]-based engines. TCEC also doubled the computing power available to CPU engines, from 44 cores to 88.\n\n==Overview==\nIn keeping with its identity as a competition run at long time controls on high-end hardware,<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.chessblog.com/2013/08/tcec-computer-chess-championship-new.html|title = TCEC Computer Chess Championship New Season starts August 26th|last = Kosteniuk |first = Alexandra|date = August 15, 2013|website = Chess News Blog|accessdate = October 25, 2013|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131025063745/http://www.chessblog.com/2013/08/tcec-computer-chess-championship-new.html|archivedate = October 25, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url = https://nypost.com/2013/06/09/engine-super-bowl/|title = Engine Super Bowl|last = Soltis|first = Andy|date = June 9, 2013|website = New York Post|accessdate = October 25, 2013}}</ref> TCEC secured a hardware upgrade for the competing CPU engines.<ref name=\"S17Info\">{{citeweb|url=http://www.chessdom.com/tcec-s17-detailed-information/|title=TCEC S17 \u2013 detailed information|publisher=Chessdom|date=21 December 2019}}</ref> Among other changes, the number of cores available is doubled from 44 to 88, the operating system used is now [[Linux]], and Syzygy [[endgame tablebases]] are now cached directly in the RAM for faster access. Because this upgrade advantages CPU engines compared to GPU engines, TCEC split the qualification paths to Premier Division by introducing separate leagues for CPU and GPU engines. While an upgrade to the GPU servers is being secured, the CPU leagues are played first.\n\n===Structure===\nFor CPU engines, there will first be a Qualification League consisting of 16 engines, followed by League 2 (16 engines) and League 1 (16 engines). In the Qualification League the top 6 engines promote. In League 2 the top 4 engines promote. The engines in each league are seeded based on their performances in previous seasons. For GPU engines, there will be one league only, with up to 16 competitors. The top 2 GPU engines will then contest a playoff against the top 4 CPU engines in League 1, with the four highest-placing engines promoting to Premier Division.\n\nPremier Division is also expanded from 8 engines to 10. Six engines - [[Stockfish (chess)|Stockfish]], [[Komodo (chess)|Komodo]], [[Houdini (chess)|Houdini]], [[Leela Chess Zero]], AllieStein, and Stoofvlees - are seeded directly to Premier Division, based on their top 6 finishes in the previous season. Finally, the top two engines in Premier Division qualify for the 100-game superfinal match.\n\n==Results==\n===CPU Qualification League===\nAfter not competing for five seasons, Season 11 Div 3 engine Defenchess trailblazed the qualification league. It scored 18 wins while conceding no losses, finishing 3.5 points clear at the top. It was the only undefeated engine. Demolito and Winter also locked up two of the promotion spots smoothly, but the remaining three slots were closely contested. Among the competitors Igel was the only engine to not lose to Defenchess and Demolito, but it lost to bottom-half engines FabChess and Topple. Comparatively, iCE was whitewashed by Defenchess and Igel, but it turned in a strong performance against its other rivals, losing only one other game to Winter. Pirarucu went through a tense moment when it lost to Winter in the penultimate round; however it pulled out a win with Black against Topple to promote. 7th-placed Minic was in a promotion spot all the way up to the final round, when it lost to Gogobello while iCE beat Counter. This left the two tied at 17.5 points. Minic had the better [[Sonneborn\u2013Berger score]], but it also had one crash, and the number of crashes was the first tiebreak. Nonetheless, in a stroke of good fortune for Minic (and 8th-placed PeSTO), the League Two engines chess22k and [[Fritz (chess)|Fritz]] crashed three times during testing for the division. By TCEC rules, if this happened, the author(s) would have to update the engine or it is disqualified. chess22k's and Fritz's authors were not able to update the engines in time, resulting in Minic and PeSTO promoting as lucky losers.<ref>https://imgur.com/GHNF1Zu</ref>\n\n{{#invoke:Sports table|main|style=WDL\n\n|show_matches=false\n|update=complete\n\n|source=[https://www.tcec-chess.com/archive.html?season=17&div=ql&game=1]\n|for_against_style=none\n|res_col_header=Q\n|result1=WC \n|result2=WC \n|result3=WC \n|result4=WC \n|result5=WC \n|result6=WC \n|col_WC=green1 |text_WC={{nowrap|Advance to League Two}}\n|result7=WB \n|result8=WB \n|col_WB=blue1 |text_WB={{nowrap|Advance to League Two (see text)}}\n|team1=DEF|team2=DEM|team3=WIN|team4=PIR|team5=IGE|team6=ICE|team7=MIN|team8=PES|team9=MAR|team10=GOG|team11=TOP|team12=COU|team13=FAB|team14=TUC|team15=ASY|team16=CHE|\n\n|win_DEF=18 |draw_DEF=12 |loss_DEF=0\n|win_DEM=12 |draw_DEM=17 |loss_DEM=1\n|win_WIN=14 |draw_WIN=12 |loss_WIN=4\n|win_PIR=10 |draw_PIR=16 |loss_PIR=4\n|win_IGE=10 |draw_IGE=16 |loss_IGE=4\n|win_ICE=10 |draw_ICE=15 |loss_ICE=5\n|win_MIN=10 |draw_MIN=15 |loss_MIN=5\n|win_PES=8 |draw_PES=17 |loss_PES=5\n|win_MAR=8 |draw_MAR=16 |loss_MAR=6\n|win_GOG=8 |draw_GOG=14 |loss_GOG=8\n|win_TOP=8 |draw_TOP=12 |loss_TOP=10\n|win_COU=4 |draw_COU=12 |loss_COU=14\n|win_FAB=3 |draw_FAB=14 |loss_FAB=13\n|win_TUC=4 |draw_TUC=9 |loss_TUC=17\n|win_ASY=2 |draw_ASY=13 |loss_ASY=15\n|win_CHE=2 |draw_CHE=8 |loss_CHE=20\n\n|winpoints=1\n|drawpoints=0.5\n|losspoints=0\n\n|team_header=Engine\n|name_DEF=Defenchess |short_DEF=DEF\n|name_DEM=Demolito |short_DEM=DEM\n|name_WIN=Winter |short_WIN=WIN\n|name_PIR=Pirarucu |short_PIR=PIR\n|name_IGE=Igel |short_IGE=IGE\n|name_ICE=iCE |short_ICE=ICE\n|name_MIN=Minic |short_MIN=MIN\n|name_PES=PeSTO |short_PES=PES\n|name_MAR=Marvin |short_MAR=MAR\n|name_GOG=Gogobello |short_GOG=GOG\n|name_TOP=Topple |short_TOP=TOP\n|name_COU=Counter |short_COU=COU\n|name_FAB=FabChess |short_FAB=FAB\n|name_TUC=Tucano |short_TUC=TUC\n|name_ASY=Asymptote |short_ASY=ASY\n|name_CHE=Cheese |short_CHE=CHE\n\n}}\n\n===CPU League Two===\nFormer Premier Division engine Fire won League Two. It had been relegated in [[TCEC Season 16|the previous season]] because its developer had submitted a drastically different neural network-based version that turned out to be significantly weaker. This season, the original, traditional engine played, and it dominated with an undefeated 22/28 (16 wins and 12 draws). It defeated seven engines, including fourth-place Vajolet, 2-0. Second placed Defenchess also turned in a strong performance, finishing with an undefeated 20.5/28 (13 wins and 15 draws). For the other promoted engines, Winter and PeSTO performed surprisingly well, comfortably finishing above their peers in 7th and 8th respectively. The remaining five promoted engines occupied the bottom five spots, and were all relegated along with Wasp (which crashed three times).\n\nAfter the division concluded, in a repeat of testing for League Two, four League One engines either pulled out or did not run on the new Linux operating system, resulting in the 5th-8th placed engines in League One promoting.\n\n{{#invoke:Sports table|main|style=WDL\n\n|show_matches=false\n|update=complete\n\n|source=[https://www.tcec-chess.com/archive.html?season=17&div=l1&game=1], see also [https://tcecbayeselo.chessdom.org/2020/01/25/tcec-season-17-league2-game-240-defenchess-2-3_dev-igel-2-3-1/] for table with Wasp's score zeroed out\n|for_against_style=none\n|res_col_header=Q\n|result1=WC \n|result2=WC \n|result3=WC \n|result4=WC \n|col_WC=green1 |text_WC={{nowrap|Advance to League One}}\n|result5=WB\n|result6=WB\n|result7=WB\n|result8=WB\n|col_WB=blue1|text_WB={{nowrap|Advance to League One (see text)}}\n|team1=FIR|team2=DEF|team3=RUB|team4=VAJ|team5=PED|team6=NEM|team7=WIN|team8=PES|team9=GUL|team10=WAS|team11=TEX|team12=DEM|team13=MIN|team14=ICE|team15=IGE|team16=PIR|\n\n|win_FIR=16|draw_FIR=14 |loss_FIR=0\n|win_DEF=14|draw_DEF=16|loss_DEF=0\n|win_RUB=9 |draw_RUB=19|loss_RUB=2\n|win_VAJ=10 |draw_VAJ=15 |loss_VAJ=5\n|win_PED=7|draw_PED=19 |loss_PED=4\n|win_WIN=6|draw_WIN=18|loss_WIN=6\n|win_PES=6|draw_PES=17|loss_PES=7\n|win_NEM=7 |draw_NEM=15|loss_NEM=8\n|win_GUL=4 |draw_GUL=21 |loss_GUL=5\n|win_WAS=5 |draw_WAS=19 |loss_WAS=6 |status_WAS=D\n|win_DEM=7 |draw_DEM=13 |loss_DEM=10\n|win_TEX=4 |draw_TEX=19 |loss_TEX=7\n|win_MIN=3 |draw_MIN=19 |loss_MIN=8\n|win_ICE=1 |draw_ICE=20 |loss_ICE=9\n|win_IGE=3 |draw_IGE=15 |loss_IGE=12\n|win_PIR=3 |draw_PIR=11 |loss_PIR=16\n\n|winpoints=1\n|drawpoints=0.5\n|losspoints=0\n\n|team_header=Engine\n|name_DEF=Defenchess |short_DEF=DEF\n|name_DEM=Demolito |short_DEM=DEM\n|name_WIN=Winter |short_WIN=WIN\n|name_PIR=Pirarucu |short_PIR=PIR\n|name_IGE=Igel |short_IGE=IGE\n|name_ICE=iCE |short_ICE=ICE\n|name_MIN=Minic |short_MIN=MIN\n|name_PES=PeSTO |short_PES=PES\n|name_FIR=Fire|short_FIR=FIR\n|name_TEX=Texel|short_TEX=TEX\n|name_RUB=RubiChess|short_RUB=RUBP\n|name_NEM=Nemorino|short_NEM=NEM\n|name_GUL=Gull|short_GUL=GUL\n|name_PED=Pedone|short_PED=PED\n|name_WAS=Wasp|short_WAS=WAS\n|name_VAJ=Vajolet|short_VAJ=VAJ\n\n}}\n\n===CPU League One===\nDuring testing for League One, three engines (Booot, Chiron, and ChessBrainVB) did not play because they did not run on [[Wine (software)|Wine]], the [[compatibility layer]] that TCEC is using to run Windows programs on Linux. One further engine (former champion [[Jonny]]) crashed and was not updated in time. As a result, the 5th to 8th-placed engines from League Two, Pedone, Nemorino, Winter and PeSTO, promoted as lucky losers.\n\nIn League One itself, Xiphos, which had just missed out on promotion in Season 16, vaulted to an early lead after scoring five wins with no losses. However, after this bright start, it failed to score more wins. This allowed former Division Premier engine Ethereal to seize first place, in spite of a loss to Komodo MCTS. Fellow competitors Fire and Komodo MCTS also amassed more wins than Xiphos, and by the midway point had overtaken it in the standings. By the final double round robin, Ethereal, Fire and Komodo MCTS had more or less secured a playoff spot. Xiphos, who had yet to lose, was barely holding on to fourth place, with rofChade and Defenchess both breathing down its neck. When it lost a crucial game to Fire, it allowed rofChade to pull even, with Defenchess half a point further back. Xiphos knocked Defenchess out of contention with a head-to-head win, but with rofChade having the superior tiebreaks (by number of wins), it needed to either hope for Fire to beat rofChade or to beat Vajolet in its last game. When both games ended drawn, Xiphos finished fifth, again just missing out on promotion.\n\nFor the other engines, Laser, which had pipped Xiphos to a playoff spot last season, was able to remain unbeaten until the final double round robin. However, it collapsed in that round, losing three games (plus forfeited a fourth due to a crash). Winter scored likely the biggest upset of the league by defeating rofChade once, but the rest of the division was not kind to it and fellow lucky losers Nemorino and PeSTO, with all three engines placing in the bottom four. Former Division Premier engine Fizbo, which had been forced to run at a much slower speed because it was not able to utilize all the hardware available to it, finished solidly last, five points off the pace. \n\n{{#invoke:Sports table|main|style=WDL\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|show_matches=false\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|update=complete\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|source=[https://www.tcec-chess.com/archive.html?season=17&div=cpul1&game=1]\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|for_against_style=none\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|res_col_header=Q\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|result1=WC \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|result2=WC \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|result3=WC \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|result4=WC \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|col_WC=green1 |text_WC={{nowrap|Advance to Playoff}}\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|team1=ETH|team2=FIR|team3=KMC|team4=ROF|team5=XIP|team6=DEF|team7=RUB|team8=AND|team9=LAS|team10=ARA|team11=VAJ|team12=PED|team13=NEM|team14=WIN|team15=PES|team16=FIZ|\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|win_ETH=21|draw_ETH=38 |loss_ETH=1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|win_FIR=18|draw_FIR=42|loss_FIR=0\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|win_KMC=13 |draw_KMC=47|loss_KMC=0\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|win_ROF=13 |draw_ROF=44 |loss_ROF=3\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|win_XIP=11|draw_XIP=48 |loss_XIP=1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|win_DEF=13|draw_DEF=42|loss_DEF=5\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|win_RUB=10|draw_RUB=46|loss_RUB=4\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|win_AND=8 |draw_AND=49|loss_AND=3\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|win_LAS=6 |draw_LAS=50 |loss_LAS=4\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|win_ARA=12 |draw_ARA=37|loss_ARA=11\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|win_PED=9 |draw_PED=37 |loss_PED=14\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|win_VAJ=8 |draw_VAJ=40|loss_VAJ=12\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|win_NEM=6 |draw_NEM=32 |loss_NEM=22\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|win_WIN=6 |draw_WIN=30 |loss_WIN=24\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|win_PES=3 |draw_PES=34 |loss_PES=23\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|win_FIZ=0 |draw_FIZ=30 |loss_FIZ=30\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|winpoints=1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|drawpoints=0.5\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|losspoints=0\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|team_header=Engine\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|name_FIR=Fire |short_FIR=FIR\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|name_PED=Pedone |short_PED=PED\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|name_RUB=RubiChess |short_RUB=RUB\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|name_FIZ=Fizbo |short_FIZ=FIZ\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|name_PES=PeSTO |short_PES=PES\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|name_WIN=Winter |short_WIN=WIN\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|name_NEM=Nemorino |short_NEM=NEM\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|name_AND=Andscacs |short_AND=AND\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|name_ETH=Ethereal|short_ETH=ETH\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|name_VAJ=Vajolet2 |short_VAJ=VAJ\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|name_KMC=KomodoMCTS|short_KMC=KMCP\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|name_DEF=Defenchess|short_DEF=DEF\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|name_LAS=Laser|short_LAS=LAS\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|name_XIP=Xiphos|short_XIP=XIP\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|name_ARA=Arasan|short_ARA=ARA\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|name_ROF=rofChade|short_ROF=ROF\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n}}\n\n===GPU league===\nThe GPU league was cancelled because only two participants met all the uniqueness criteria: ChessFighter and ScorpioNN.{{cn|date=March 2020}} Both engines automatically qualified to play against the top four engines from the CPU league one.\n\n===Playoff===\nFire convincingly won the playoff for Premier Division in spite of no longer being under development. It finished with a +7 score, defeating all its rivals except ScorpioNN at least once. Komodo MCTS and ScorpioNN both lost two games, but finished comfortably in the top four, with wins against rofChade and ChessFighter. League One winner Ethereal stumbled badly in the playoffs, losing first to rofChade and then to Fire. As a result, the final promotion spot was closely contested. In the penultimate round rofChade temporarily pulled even with Ethereal by defeating ChessFighter, but Ethereal drew against Komodo MCTS to remain half a point ahead. It came down to the direct head-to-head encounter in the final round. rofChade needed to defeat Ethereal with the black pieces, which would've let it qualify because of its superior head-to-head score. However, it did not make any headway, and Ethereal squeaked into Premier Division, half a point ahead of rofChade.\n\n{{#invoke:Sports table|main|style=WDL\n\n|show_matches=false\n|update=complete\n\n|source=[https://www.tcec-chess.com/archive.html?season=17&div=playofffordivp&game=1]\n|for_against_style=none\n|res_col_header=Q\n|result1=WC \n|result2=WC \n|result3=WC \n|result4=WC \n|col_WC=green1 |text_WC={{nowrap|Advance to Premier Division}}\n|team1=FIR|team2=KMC|team3=SCO|team4=ETH|team5=ROF|team6=CF\n\n|win_FIR=7 |draw_FIR=13 |loss_DEF=0\n|win_KMC=6 |draw_KMC=12 |loss_KMC=2\n|win_SCO=3 |draw_SCO=15 |loss_SCO=2\n|win_ETH=1 |draw_ETH=17 |loss_ETH=2\n|win_ROF=3 |draw_ROF=12 |loss_ROF=5\n|win_CF=0  |draw_CF=11 |loss_CF=9\n\n|winpoints=1\n|drawpoints=0.5\n|losspoints=0\n\n|team_header=Engine\n|name_FIR=Fire|short_FIR=FIR\n|name_KMC=Komodo MCTS|short_KMC=KMC\n|name_SCO=ScorpioNN |short_SCO=SCO\n|name_ETH=Ethereal|short_ETH=ETH\n|name_ROF=rofChade |short_ROF=ROF\n|name_CF=ChessFighter |short_CF=CF\n}}\n\n===Premier Division===\nIn an unprecedented move, TCEC played all the CPU-CPU matches first, to minimize rental costs for the GPUs.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.chessdom.com/tcec-season-17-premier-division-is-now-live/|title=TCEC Season 17 \u2013 Premier Division is now live!|publisher=Chessdom|date=17 March 2020|accessdate=18 March 2020}}</ref><ref>https://imgur.com/zAHOIMR</ref>\n\nIn the CPU-CPU matches, defending champion [[Stockfish (chess)|Stockfish]] steamrolled its rivals.

Houdini, which had not been updated for over two years, was further handicapped by only being able to make use of 64 of the 176 available [[thread (computing)|threads]], and was last after the double round robin. Komodo MCTS was the only engine not to lose to Stockfish, but it also failed to score any wins. Fellow promoted engine Fire performed surprisingly well, scoring two wins while losing only to Stockfish. Combined with its run through the lower divisions as well as in Season 16, it set a new TCEC record of 124 games without losing.\n\nIn the CPU-GPU and GPU-GPU matches, S15 runner-up AllieStein took an early lead over S15 third-place finisher Lc0, scoring 4 wins to Lc0's 2 in the first round robin. It looked as though the season 15 result, in which AllieStein pipped Lc0 to second place in spite of the latter not losing any games, would be repeated. However, a dramatic second round robin saw Ethereal playing kingmaker. First it defeated AllieStein, then it was defeated by Lc0 after it blundered a 7-man [[endgame tablebase]] draw. After this stroke of good fortune Lc0 went on a winning streak to take the lead, defeating Stoofvlees, Komodo, and Komodo MCTS successively. However Ethereal continued to play kingmaker, this time losing to AllieStein in the reverse game and then defeating Lc0 after the latter blundered in a complicated position (diagram). Lc0 finally effectively eliminated Alliestein with a head-to-head win, which also put her ahead of Stockfish in first place, but the drama was not over as she lost another game to Komodo. This allowed Stockfish the chance to at least tie Lc0 at the top of the standings with a win over Stoofvlees, but it failed to do so. The division ended with Lc0 winning for the first time in spite of losing its first premier division games since [[TCEC Season 14|Season 14]], and with Stockfish failing to finish first for the first time since Season 10. \n\nIn the fight to avoid relegation, Houdini, ScorpioNN and Komodo MCTS were quickly left behind, but the final slot was closely-contested. Fire failed to score any more wins after its initial two, but it also only lost two more games, to AllieStein and Lc0. Ethereal, with its giant-slaying performance against Lc0 and AllieStein, had taken a surprising fourth place, ahead of traditional powerhouse [[Komodo (chess)|Komodo]]. Stoofvlees had played extremely optimistically and suffered losses to the top three competitors as a result, but scored a head-to-head win against both Komodo and Ethereal while not conceding any other losses. By the final games, Ethereal had successfully reached safety, but Komodo was in real danger of relegating after finding itself in a tight position against Lc0. If it lost and Stoofvlees drew with Stockfish in the final game, then it would be relegated because of its inferior head-to-head score amongst the three. However, when Lc0 pushed too hard and blundered in a time scramble, the game turned into a win for Komodo that put it ahead of Ethereal and left Fire to relegate.\n\n{{Chess diagram\n|fen=r1q1rb1k/pb4pp/3p1n1N/2p3Q1/3nP3/P1N1B1P1/1P3PBP/R2R2K1 b - - 4 24|align=tright|header=Ethereal\u2013Leela Chess Zero|footer=In this complicated position, White is in the midst of an attack against Black's king, but has no forced win.

The defending champion is [[Stockfish (chess)|Stockfish]], which defeated [[AllieStein]] in the [[TCEC Season 16]] superfinal.\n\nSeason 17 featured for the first time two separate leagues, one for [[GPU]]-based engines and one for [[CPU]]-based engines. TCEC also doubled the computing power available to CPU engines, from 44 cores to 88.\n\n==Overview==\nIn keeping with its identity as a competition run at long time controls on high-end hardware,<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.chessblog.com/2013/08/tcec-computer-chess-championship-new.html|title = TCEC Computer Chess Championship New Season starts August 26th|last = Kosteniuk |first = Alexandra|date = August 15, 2013|website = Chess News Blog|accessdate = October 25, 2013|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131025063745/http://www.chessblog.com/2013/08/tcec-computer-chess-championship-new.html|archivedate = October 25, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url = https://nypost.com/2013/06/09/engine-super-bowl/|title = Engine Super Bowl|last = Soltis|first = Andy|date = June 9, 2013|website = New York Post|accessdate = October 25, 2013}}</ref> TCEC secured a hardware upgrade for the competing CPU engines.<ref name=\"S17Info\">{{citeweb|url=http://www.chessdom.com/tcec-s17-detailed-information/|title=TCEC S17 \u2013 detailed information|publisher=Chessdom|date=21 December 2019}}</ref> Among other changes, the number of cores available is doubled from 44 to 88, the operating system used is now [[Linux]], and Syzygy [[endgame tablebases]] are now cached directly in the RAM for faster access. Because this upgrade advantages CPU engines compared to GPU engines, TCEC split the qualification paths to Premier Division by introducing separate leagues for CPU and GPU engines. While an upgrade to the GPU servers is being secured, the CPU leagues are played first.\n\n===Structure===\nFor CPU engines, there will first be a Qualification League consisting of 16 engines, followed by League 2 (16 engines) and League 1 (16 engines). In the Qualification League the top 6 engines promote. In League 2 the top 4 engines promote. The engines in each league are seeded based on their performances in previous seasons. For GPU engines, there will be one league only, with up to 16 competitors. The top 2 GPU engines will then contest a playoff against the top 4 CPU engines in League 1, with the four highest-placing engines promoting to Premier Division.\n\nPremier Division is also expanded from 8 engines to 10. Six engines - [[Stockfish (chess)|Stockfish]], [[Komodo (chess)|Komodo]], [[Houdini (chess)|Houdini]], [[Leela Chess Zero]], AllieStein, and Stoofvlees - are seeded directly to Premier Division, based on their top 6 finishes in the previous season. Finally, the top two engines in Premier Division qualify for the 100-game superfinal match.\n\n==Results==\n===CPU Qualification League===\nAfter not competing for five seasons, Season 11 Div 3 engine Defenchess trailblazed the qualification league. It scored 18 wins while conceding no losses, finishing 3.5 points clear at the top. It was the only undefeated engine. Demolito and Winter also locked up two of the promotion spots smoothly, but the remaining three slots were closely contested. Among the competitors Igel was the only engine to not lose to Defenchess and Demolito, but it lost to bottom-half engines FabChess and Topple. Comparatively, iCE was whitewashed by Defenchess and Igel, but it turned in a strong performance against its other rivals, losing only one other game to Winter. Pirarucu went through a tense moment when it lost to Winter in the penultimate round; however it pulled out a win with Black against Topple to promote. 7th-placed Minic was in a promotion spot all the way up to the final round, when it lost to Gogobello while iCE beat Counter. This left the two tied at 17.5 points. Minic had the better [[Sonneborn\u2013Berger score]], but it also had one crash, and the number of crashes was the first tiebreak. Nonetheless, in a stroke of good fortune for Minic (and 8th-placed PeSTO), the League Two engines chess22k and [[Fritz (chess)|Fritz]] crashed three times during testing for the division. By TCEC rules, if this happened, the author(s) would have to update the engine or it is disqualified. chess22k's and Fritz's authors were not able to update the engines in time, resulting in Minic and PeSTO promoting as lucky losers.<ref>https://imgur.com/GHNF1Zu</ref>\n\n{{#invoke:Sports table|main|style=WDL\n\n|show_matches=false\n|update=complete\n\n|source=[https://www.tcec-chess.com/archive.html?season=17&div=ql&game=1]\n|for_against_style=none\n|res_col_header=Q\n|result1=WC \n|result2=WC \n|result3=WC \n|result4=WC \n|result5=WC \n|result6=WC \n|col_WC=green1 |text_WC={{nowrap|Advance to League Two}}\n|result7=WB \n|result8=WB \n|col_WB=blue1 |text_WB={{nowrap|Advance to League Two (see text)}}\n|team1=DEF|team2=DEM|team3=WIN|team4=PIR|team5=IGE|team6=ICE|team7=MIN|team8=PES|team9=MAR|team10=GOG|team11=TOP|team12=COU|team13=FAB|team14=TUC|team15=ASY|team16=CHE|\n\n|win_DEF=18 |draw_DEF=12 |loss_DEF=0\n|win_DEM=12 |draw_DEM=17 |loss_DEM=1\n|win_WIN=14 |draw_WIN=12 |loss_WIN=4\n|win_PIR=10 |draw_PIR=16 |loss_PIR=4\n|win_IGE=10 |draw_IGE=16 |loss_IGE=4\n|win_ICE=10 |draw_ICE=15 |loss_ICE=5\n|win_MIN=10 |draw_MIN=15 |loss_MIN=5\n|win_PES=8 |draw_PES=17 |loss_PES=5\n|win_MAR=8 |draw_MAR=16 |loss_MAR=6\n|win_GOG=8 |draw_GOG=14 |loss_GOG=8\n|win_TOP=8 |draw_TOP=12 |loss_TOP=10\n|win_COU=4 |draw_COU=12 |loss_COU=14\n|win_FAB=3 |draw_FAB=14 |loss_FAB=13\n|win_TUC=4 |draw_TUC=9 |loss_TUC=17\n|win_ASY=2 |draw_ASY=13 |loss_ASY=15\n|win_CHE=2 |draw_CHE=8 |loss_CHE=20\n\n|winpoints=1\n|drawpoints=0.5\n|losspoints=0\n\n|team_header=Engine\n|name_DEF=Defenchess |short_DEF=DEF\n|name_DEM=Demolito |short_DEM=DEM\n|name_WIN=Winter |short_WIN=WIN\n|name_PIR=Pirarucu |short_PIR=PIR\n|name_IGE=Igel |short_IGE=IGE\n|name_ICE=iCE |short_ICE=ICE\n|name_MIN=Minic |short_MIN=MIN\n|name_PES=PeSTO |short_PES=PES\n|name_MAR=Marvin |short_MAR=MAR\n|name_GOG=Gogobello |short_GOG=GOG\n|name_TOP=Topple |short_TOP=TOP\n|name_COU=Counter |short_COU=COU\n|name_FAB=FabChess |short_FAB=FAB\n|name_TUC=Tucano |short_TUC=TUC\n|name_ASY=Asymptote |short_ASY=ASY\n|name_CHE=Cheese |short_CHE=CHE\n\n}}\n\n===CPU League Two===\nFormer Premier Division engine Fire won League Two. It had been relegated in [[TCEC Season 16|the previous season]] because its developer had submitted a drastically different neural network-based version that turned out to be significantly weaker. This season, the original, traditional engine played, and it dominated with an undefeated 22/28 (16 wins and 12 draws). It defeated seven engines, including fourth-place Vajolet, 2-0. Second placed Defenchess also turned in a strong performance, finishing with an undefeated 20.5/28 (13 wins and 15 draws). For the other promoted engines, Winter and PeSTO performed surprisingly well, comfortably finishing above their peers in 7th and 8th respectively. The remaining five promoted engines occupied the bottom five spots, and were all relegated along with Wasp (which crashed three times).\n\nAfter the division concluded, in a repeat of testing for League Two, four League One engines either pulled out or did not run on the new Linux operating system, resulting in the 5th-8th placed engines in League One promoting.\n\n{{#invoke:Sports table|main|style=WDL\n\n|show_matches=false\n|update=complete\n\n|source=[https://www.tcec-chess.com/archive.html?season=17&div=l1&game=1], see also [https://tcecbayeselo.chessdom.org/2020/01/25/tcec-season-17-league2-game-240-defenchess-2-3_dev-igel-2-3-1/] for table with Wasp's score zeroed out\n|for_against_style=none\n|res_col_header=Q\n|result1=WC \n|result2=WC \n|result3=WC \n|result4=WC \n|col_WC=green1 |text_WC={{nowrap|Advance to League One}}\n|result5=WB\n|result6=WB\n|result7=WB\n|result8=WB\n|col_WB=blue1|text_WB={{nowrap|Advance to League One (see text)}}\n|team1=FIR|team2=DEF|team3=RUB|team4=VAJ|team5=PED|team6=NEM|team7=WIN|team8=PES|team9=GUL|team10=WAS|team11=TEX|team12=DEM|team13=MIN|team14=ICE|team15=IGE|team16=PIR|\n\n|win_FIR=16|draw_FIR=14 |loss_FIR=0\n|win_DEF=14|draw_DEF=16|loss_DEF=0\n|win_RUB=9 |draw_RUB=19|loss_RUB=2\n|win_VAJ=10 |draw_VAJ=15 |loss_VAJ=5\n|win_PED=7|draw_PED=19 |loss_PED=4\n|win_WIN=6|draw_WIN=18|loss_WIN=6\n|win_PES=6|draw_PES=17|loss_PES=7\n|win_NEM=7 |draw_NEM=15|loss_NEM=8\n|win_GUL=4 |draw_GUL=21 |loss_GUL=5\n|win_WAS=5 |draw_WAS=19 |loss_WAS=6 |status_WAS=D\n|win_DEM=7 |draw_DEM=13 |loss_DEM=10\n|win_TEX=4 |draw_TEX=19 |loss_TEX=7\n|win_MIN=3 |draw_MIN=19 |loss_MIN=8\n|win_ICE=1 |draw_ICE=20 |loss_ICE=9\n|win_IGE=3 |draw_IGE=15 |loss_IGE=12\n|win_PIR=3 |draw_PIR=11 |loss_PIR=16\n\n|winpoints=1\n|drawpoints=0.5\n|losspoints=0\n\n|team_header=Engine\n|name_DEF=Defenchess |short_DEF=DEF\n|name_DEM=Demolito |short_DEM=DEM\n|name_WIN=Winter |short_WIN=WIN\n|name_PIR=Pirarucu |short_PIR=PIR\n|name_IGE=Igel |short_IGE=IGE\n|name_ICE=iCE |short_ICE=ICE\n|name_MIN=Minic |short_MIN=MIN\n|name_PES=PeSTO |short_PES=PES\n|name_FIR=Fire|short_FIR=FIR\n|name_TEX=Texel|short_TEX=TEX\n|name_RUB=RubiChess|short_RUB=RUBP\n|name_NEM=Nemorino|short_NEM=NEM\n|name_GUL=Gull|short_GUL=GUL\n|name_PED=Pedone|short_PED=PED\n|name_WAS=Wasp|short_WAS=WAS\n|name_VAJ=Vajolet|short_VAJ=VAJ\n\n}}\n\n===CPU League One===\nDuring testing for League One, three engines (Booot, Chiron, and ChessBrainVB) did not play because they did not run on [[Wine (software)|Wine]], the [[compatibility layer]] that TCEC is using to run Windows programs on Linux. One further engine (former champion [[Jonny]]) crashed and was not updated in time. As a result, the 5th to 8th-placed engines from League Two, Pedone, Nemorino, Winter and PeSTO, promoted as lucky losers.\n\nIn League One itself, Xiphos, which had just missed out on promotion in Season 16, vaulted to an early lead after scoring five wins with no losses. However, after this bright start, it failed to score more wins. This allowed former Division Premier engine Ethereal to seize first place, in spite of a loss to Komodo MCTS. Fellow competitors Fire and Komodo MCTS also amassed more wins than Xiphos, and by the midway point had overtaken it in the standings. By the final double round robin, Ethereal, Fire and Komodo MCTS had more or less secured a playoff spot. Xiphos, who had yet to lose, was barely holding on to fourth place, with rofChade and Defenchess both breathing down its neck. When it lost a crucial game to Fire, it allowed rofChade to pull even, with Defenchess half a point further back. Xiphos knocked Defenchess out of contention with a head-to-head win, but with rofChade having the superior tiebreaks (by number of wins), it needed to either hope for Fire to beat rofChade or to beat Vajolet in its last game. When both games ended drawn, Xiphos finished fifth, again just missing out on promotion.\n\nFor the other engines, Laser, which had pipped Xiphos to a playoff spot last season, was able to remain unbeaten until the final double round robin. However, it collapsed in that round, losing three games (plus forfeited a fourth due to a crash). Winter scored likely the biggest upset of the league by defeating rofChade once, but the rest of the division was not kind to it and fellow lucky losers Nemorino and PeSTO, with all three engines placing in the bottom four. Former Division Premier engine Fizbo, which had been forced to run at a much slower speed because it was not able to utilize all the hardware available to it, finished solidly last, five points off the pace. \n\n{{#invoke:Sports table|main|style=WDL\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|show_matches=false\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|update=complete\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|source=[https://www.tcec-chess.com/archive.html?season=17&div=cpul1&game=1]\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|for_against_style=none\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|res_col_header=Q\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|result1=WC \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|result2=WC \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|result3=WC \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|result4=WC \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|col_WC=green1 |text_WC={{nowrap|Advance to Playoff}}\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|team1=ETH|team2=FIR|team3=KMC|team4=ROF|team5=XIP|team6=DEF|team7=RUB|team8=AND|team9=LAS|team10=ARA|team11=VAJ|team12=PED|team13=NEM|team14=WIN|team15=PES|team16=FIZ|\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|win_ETH=21|draw_ETH=38 |loss_ETH=1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|win_FIR=18|draw_FIR=42|loss_FIR=0\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|win_KMC=13 |draw_KMC=47|loss_KMC=0\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|win_ROF=13 |draw_ROF=44 |loss_ROF=3\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|win_XIP=11|draw_XIP=48 |loss_XIP=1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|win_DEF=13|draw_DEF=42|loss_DEF=5\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|win_RUB=10|draw_RUB=46|loss_RUB=4\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|win_AND=8 |draw_AND=49|loss_AND=3\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|win_LAS=6 |draw_LAS=50 |loss_LAS=4\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|win_ARA=12 |draw_ARA=37|loss_ARA=11\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|win_PED=9 |draw_PED=37 |loss_PED=14\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|win_VAJ=8 |draw_VAJ=40|loss_VAJ=12\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|win_NEM=6 |draw_NEM=32 |loss_NEM=22\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|win_WIN=6 |draw_WIN=30 |loss_WIN=24\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|win_PES=3 |draw_PES=34 |loss_PES=23\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|win_FIZ=0 |draw_FIZ=30 |loss_FIZ=30\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|winpoints=1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|drawpoints=0.5\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|losspoints=0\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|team_header=Engine\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|name_FIR=Fire |short_FIR=FIR\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|name_PED=Pedone |short_PED=PED\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|name_RUB=RubiChess |short_RUB=RUB\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|name_FIZ=Fizbo |short_FIZ=FIZ\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|name_PES=PeSTO |short_PES=PES\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|name_WIN=Winter |short_WIN=WIN\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|name_NEM=Nemorino |short_NEM=NEM\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|name_AND=Andscacs |short_AND=AND\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|name_ETH=Ethereal|short_ETH=ETH\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|name_VAJ=Vajolet2 |short_VAJ=VAJ\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|name_KMC=KomodoMCTS|short_KMC=KMCP\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|name_DEF=Defenchess|short_DEF=DEF\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|name_LAS=Laser|short_LAS=LAS\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|name_XIP=Xiphos|short_XIP=XIP\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|name_ARA=Arasan|short_ARA=ARA\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|name_ROF=rofChade|short_ROF=ROF\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n}}\n\n===GPU league===\nThe GPU league was cancelled because only two participants met all the uniqueness criteria: ChessFighter and ScorpioNN.{{cn|date=March 2020}} Both engines automatically qualified to play against the top four engines from the CPU league one.\n\n===Playoff===\nFire convincingly won the playoff for Premier Division in spite of no longer being under development. It finished with a +7 score, defeating all its rivals except ScorpioNN at least once. Komodo MCTS and ScorpioNN both lost two games, but finished comfortably in the top four, with wins against rofChade and ChessFighter. League One winner Ethereal stumbled badly in the playoffs, losing first to rofChade and then to Fire. As a result, the final promotion spot was closely contested. In the penultimate round rofChade temporarily pulled even with Ethereal by defeating ChessFighter, but Ethereal drew against Komodo MCTS to remain half a point ahead. It came down to the direct head-to-head encounter in the final round. rofChade needed to defeat Ethereal with the black pieces, which would've let it qualify because of its superior head-to-head score. However, it did not make any headway, and Ethereal squeaked into Premier Division, half a point ahead of rofChade.\n\n{{#invoke:Sports table|main|style=WDL\n\n|show_matches=false\n|update=complete\n\n|source=[https://www.tcec-chess.com/archive.html?season=17&div=playofffordivp&game=1]\n|for_against_style=none\n|res_col_header=Q\n|result1=WC \n|result2=WC \n|result3=WC \n|result4=WC \n|col_WC=green1 |text_WC={{nowrap|Advance to Premier Division}}\n|team1=FIR|team2=KMC|team3=SCO|team4=ETH|team5=ROF|team6=CF\n\n|win_FIR=7 |draw_FIR=13 |loss_DEF=0\n|win_KMC=6 |draw_KMC=12 |loss_KMC=2\n|win_SCO=3 |draw_SCO=15 |loss_SCO=2\n|win_ETH=1 |draw_ETH=17 |loss_ETH=2\n|win_ROF=3 |draw_ROF=12 |loss_ROF=5\n|win_CF=0  |draw_CF=11 |loss_CF=9\n\n|winpoints=1\n|drawpoints=0.5\n|losspoints=0\n\n|team_header=Engine\n|name_FIR=Fire|short_FIR=FIR\n|name_KMC=Komodo MCTS|short_KMC=KMC\n|name_SCO=ScorpioNN |short_SCO=SCO\n|name_ETH=Ethereal|short_ETH=ETH\n|name_ROF=rofChade |short_ROF=ROF\n|name_CF=ChessFighter |short_CF=CF\n}}\n\n===Premier Division===\nIn an unprecedented move, TCEC played all the CPU-CPU matches first, to minimize rental costs for the GPUs.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.chessdom.com/tcec-season-17-premier-division-is-now-live/|title=TCEC Season 17 \u2013 Premier Division is now live!|publisher=Chessdom|date=17 March 2020|accessdate=18 March 2020}}</ref><ref>https://imgur.com/zAHOIMR</ref>\n\nIn the CPU-CPU matches, defending champion [[Stockfish (chess)|Stockfish]] steamrolled its rivals. It defeated [[Houdini (chess)|Houdini]] and Ethereal twice, scoring six wins in the process, one more than the rest of the division combined. Houdini, which had not been updated for over two years, was further handicapped by only being able to make use of 64 of the 176 available [[thread (computing)|threads]], and was last after the double round robin. Komodo MCTS was the only engine not to lose to Stockfish, but it also failed to score any wins. Fellow promoted engine Fire performed surprisingly well, scoring two wins while losing only to Stockfish. Combined with its run through the lower divisions as well as in Season 16, it set a new TCEC record of 124 games without losing.\n\nIn the CPU-GPU and GPU-GPU matches, S15 runner-up AllieStein took an early lead over S15 third-place finisher Lc0, scoring 4 wins to Lc0's 2 in the first round robin. It looked as though the season 15 result, in which AllieStein pipped Lc0 to second place in spite of the latter not losing any games, would be repeated. However, a dramatic second round robin saw Ethereal playing kingmaker. First it defeated AllieStein, then it was defeated by Lc0 after it blundered a 7-man [[endgame tablebase]] draw. After this stroke of good fortune Lc0 went on a winning streak to take the lead, defeating Stoofvlees, Komodo, and Komodo MCTS successively. However Ethereal continued to play kingmaker, this time losing to AllieStein in the reverse game and then defeating Lc0 after the latter blundered in a complicated position (diagram). Lc0 finally effectively eliminated Alliestein with a head-to-head win, which also put her ahead of Stockfish in first place, but the drama was not over as she lost another game to Komodo. This allowed Stockfish the chance to at least tie Lc0 at the top of the standings with a win over Stoofvlees, but it failed to do so. The division ended with Lc0 winning for the first time in spite of losing its first premier division games since [[TCEC Season 14|Season 14]], and with Stockfish failing to finish first for the first time since Season 10. \n\nIn the fight to avoid relegation, Houdini, ScorpioNN and Komodo MCTS were quickly left behind, but the final slot was closely-contested. Fire failed to score any more wins after its initial two, but it also only lost two more games, to AllieStein and Lc0. Ethereal, with its giant-slaying performance against Lc0 and AllieStein, had taken a surprising fourth place, ahead of traditional powerhouse [[Komodo (chess)|Komodo]]. Stoofvlees had played extremely optimistically and suffered losses to the top three competitors as a result, but scored a head-to-head win against both Komodo and Ethereal while not conceding any other losses. By the final games, Ethereal had successfully reached safety, but Komodo was in real danger of relegating after finding itself in a tight position against Lc0. If it lost and Stoofvlees drew with Stockfish in the final game, then it would be relegated because of its inferior head-to-head score amongst the three. However, when Lc0 pushed too hard and blundered in a time scramble, the game turned into a win for Komodo that put it ahead of Ethereal and left Fire to relegate.\n\n{{Chess diagram\n|fen=r1q1rb1k/pb4pp/3p1n1N/2p3Q1/3nP3/P1N1B1P1/1P3PBP/R2R2K1 b - - 4 24|align=tright|header=Ethereal\u2013Leela Chess Zero|footer=In this complicated position, White is in the midst of an attack against Black's king, but has no forced win.

Spencer's biggest rival is her older sister, Melissa, and the two are constantly fighting over something. Their relationship is often strained by the fact that Spencer has a habit of crushing on Melissa's boyfriends. In the first season, she begins a relationship with fellow student and strained Rosewood student Toby Cavanaugh. Throughout the series, Spencer is revealed to be the biological daughter of Mary Drake and the sister of Charlotte Drake.\n\n===Aria Montgomery===\n{{main|Aria Montgomery}}\nConsidered the \"alternative\" one of the group, '''Aria Montgomery''', portrayed by [[Lucy Hale]], is more outgoing in fashion and what she sees as acceptable behavior. She moves back to Rosewood with her family after living in Iceland for a year. Before Alison's death, she and Alison discovered that Aria's father was having an affair with one of his former students, Meredith, who became his coworker at Hollis College. Alison encourages Aria to tell her mother the truth, but instead, Aria reluctantly agrees to keep her father's secret. On top of that, she finds herself involved with her high school English teacher, Ezra Fitz, after making out with him in a pub bathroom and discovering he was her English teacher on the first day of school.\n\n===Hanna Marin===\n{{main|Hanna Marin}}\nPretty and fierce, '''Hanna Marin''', portrayed by [[Ashley Benson]], is the diva and \"[[it girl]]\" of the group, having taken Alison's place as the most popular girl at Rosewood High. Prior to Alison's death, Hanna suffered from [[Bulimia nervosa|bulimia]], which Alison frequently teased her over. Since her parents divorced, Hanna permanently lives with her mother. She feels betrayed by her father, who has remarried, and she does not get along well with his new wife and daughter. When Hanna's mother falls upon financial hardship, she steals thousands of dollars from the bank she worked at, which Hanna is forced to keep a secret.\n\n===Emily Fields===\n{{main|Emily Fields}}\nThe \"[[Jock (athlete)|jock]]\" of the group, '''Emily Fields''', portrayed by [[Shay Mitchell]], is a highly competitive swimmer, considered the star of Rosewood's swimming team. She is shown as a sweet and shy young. For a short time, Emily lives with Hanna, after her mother moves to Texas to live with Emily's father, who is stationed in Fort Hood. She begins to question her sexuality because of her feeling for Alison, but later accepts the fact that she is a lesbian and starts to date girls. She eventually begins a relationship with Sara Harvey, until she discovers that she is an ally of the antagonist.\n\n===Alison DiLaurentis===\n{{main|Alison DiLaurentis}}\nThe former \"[[Queen bee (sociology)|queen bee]]\" of her clique, '''Alison DiLaurentis''', portrayed by [[Sasha Pieterse]], used to be the most popular girl in school before her disappearance and alleged death. Although she cared for her friends, she enjoyed using their deepest secrets against them to keep them in line. Charming and manipulative, Alison was skilled at finding ways to blackmail everyone, and many people hated her. She knew everybody's secrets, but since she's been gone her friends are beginning to realize how little they really knew about her. She is revealed to be alive and on the run from \"A.\"\n\n===Mona Vanderwaal===\n{{main|Mona Vanderwaal}}\nA former \"unpopular\" girl at Rosewood, '''Mona Vanderwaal''', portrayed by [[Janel Parrish]], longed to be accepted into Alison's group and was continuously mocked by her. After Alison's disappearance, Mona befriended Hanna and they underwent an \"extreme makeover\" together; as a result, they both became popular students. When \"A\" appears, Mona becomes jealous of Hanna rekindling her friendships with the other Liars. She dislikes Caleb and makes attempts to break Hanna and Caleb up, though to no avail. She becomes romantically involved with Noel, much to Hanna's disapproval, but is later dumped by him for Jenna. When \"A\" begins sending Mona threatening notes, she grows closer to the Liars. In the second-season finale, she is in fact revealed to actually be \"A\" when she and Spencer travel to the Lost Woods Resort to uncover \"A\"'s lair. She is committed to a mental institution, Radley, after being diagnosed with [[borderline personality disorder]].\n\n===\"A\"{{anchor|A|A.D.|Uber A}}===\n{{main|A (Pretty Little Liars)}}\nThe main [[antagonist]], \"'''A'''\" is stalking and torturing the Liars in relentless and creative ways and also threatens their friends and family. In the second-season finale, it is revealed that Mona is \"A\". She is also the one who stalked Alison before her disappearance. However, when she is sent to Radley sanitarium, she is visited by CeCe Drake, who offers her a partnership and takes over the team of \"A's\", known as the A-Team. The team consists of Mona, Toby, Spencer, Sara, Lucas, Melissa, Wilden, Jenna, Noel, and Wren. Five years later, Alex Drake takes over and becomes Uber A, known as \"A.D.\", and forms the A.D. Team, consisting of Jenna, Sydney, Aria, Wren, Mona, and Mary.\n\n==Acquaintances of Aria Montgomery==\nThe following characters are all family members and acquaintances of '''Aria Montgomery''', one of the protagonists of the series.\n\n===Family===\n* {{anchor|Ella Montgomery}}'''Ella Montgomery''' ([[Holly Marie Combs]]) (seasons 1 \u2013 7) is Aria's mother, as well as a teacher at Rosewood High. Ella believes in treating her children as friends, not as property. She has mentioned that she doesn't want to push into Aria's private life, and she thinks that Aria should be allowed to keep secrets. Ella was unaware of her husband's affair with a student until \"A\" sent her a letter. After asking Byron to move out, and his refusal, she left the home. Eventually, Aria found out her parents were secretly getting back together, and Ella decides to move back in. When her son, Mike, is depressed, she doesn't feel he needs medication, and remains somewhat in denial about his illness. She finally receives her wake-up call when he attacks her in his bedroom. When Ella found out Aria was dating Ezra, she was angry, but she believed Aria when she said she had broken it off, and tried to win her back her freedom, which Byron didn't think she deserved. Later, she finds out that Aria and Ezra are still together, and decides she is going to try to understand their relationship. Ella is aware of A, and tries to send Aria to a boarding school to get away. Aria is furious, and blackmails her mother into not going through with it. Ella tearfully tells Aria how ashamed she is, and how she doesn't know how to save their relationship. In season 3, she and Byron have divorced and Ella tries to move on with her life not knowing how. Aria creates a profile for her on a dating website under the nickname \"Hot Mamma.\" Ella is furious at Aria but later she likes the idea and starts dating again. She befriends and starts dating the owner of the brew who is much younger than her. In season 4, she leaves Rosewood so she can go live with her boyfriend in Europe but returns at the end of season 4.\n* {{anchor|Byron Montgomery}}'''Byron Montgomery''' ([[Chad Lowe]]) (seasons 1 \u2013 7) is Aria's father and a history professor at Hollis College.

Regretting the affair and wanting them to be a family again, Byron moves the family to Iceland for a year as a sabbatical. The relationship between Byron and Ella becomes strained after A sends her a letter revealing Byron's affair. After spending some time apart, Ella and Byron slowly begin to rebuild their relationship. When Mike becomes depressed, Byron reveals that his brother Scott, who committed suicide, also suffered from mental illness; Byron feels guilty for not doing anything to help his brother. Byron finds out that Ezra is involved in a relationship with Aria after they tell him and Ella and is furious about it. In an effort to get Ezra away from Aria, Byron recommends him for a job in New Orleans. He also plots to send Aria to an all girls boarding school in Vermont. When Aria threatens to reveal his affair to his boss, he backs off from her but gets Ezra fired from Hollis. In season 3, Byron and Ella have divorced and Ella has moved out of the house. Byron starts seeing Meredith again. He informs Aria that Meredith got a job at Rosewood High, were Aria attends and Ella teaches. In the Halloween episode, it is revealed by Garrett that Byron may have seen Alison on the night she died. Alison told him,\"you know what I'm capable of!\"\n* {{anchor|Mike Montgomery}}'''Mike Montgomery''' ([[Cody Christian]]) (seasons 1\u20132, 4\u20136) is Aria's younger brother. A lacrosse player, he suffers from a mental illness, which causes him to burst into fits of anger and later leads him to break into people's houses for fun, before he begins to shut down emotionally and withdraw completely from his family. He blames Aria for the trouble between their parents. Mike accidentally discovered that Jenna and Garrett knew each other when he stole a pot made Jenna from Garrett's house. Mike reveals to Aria that the only reason he punched Ezra was because after Ezra and Aria announced they are a couple, he feared what Byron would have done to hurt Ezra judging by the look on his face and thought, \"better I do it, than him.\" Throughout the rest of the series he appears to have improved after going to a therapist. It does not tell when or if he was still seeing his therapist. He seemed to forgive Aria and their relationship is better. He stopped being rebellious and more focused of his family's problems and helping them out. He is dating Mona Vanderwaal.\n\n===Friends===\n* {{anchor|Holden Strauss}}'''Holden Strauss''' ([[Shane Coffey]]) (seasons 2\u20133, 7) is a childhood friend of Aria's who returns with his family from a year abroad in Portugal in the middle of Season 2. He asks Aria out on a date, and discovers that she only agreed so she could get out of the house unsupervised and try to meet Ezra. Instead of becoming upset, he suggest that they continue the cover, though he remains secretive about what he does during their fake dates. We later find out that his secret is more serious than it seemed at first when he accidentally reveals a very large bruise on his stomach, but he tells Aria not to worry about it. He eventually tells her that he is doing Tae Kwan Do, a Korean martial art, and that his parents forbid him to keep training, that is why he needs a cover. The situation turns out to be more complicated, though, when Ella tells Aria that Holden has a heart condition that could kill him any time. Aria goes to watch one of Holden's fights and she sees how much he loves to fight. In the sixth episode in season 3, he attends the same church party as Hanna and when Emily arrives, he runs into her and sparks a conversation.

He became romantically involved with Aria after the two met at a bar and instantly bonded. When he discovered that Aria was his student, he attempted to break things off, but found himself unable to do so. He broke up with Aria for a little while in order to take time to think about their relationship. He quit his teaching position at Rosewood just before Noel threatened to expose Aria and Ezra's relationship. Ezra later explains to Aria that he was engaged to a girl named Jackie when he was in college, but that she broke it off; Jackie later returns to Rosewood after getting a teaching position at Hollis. Although Ezra loves Aria, he seems to still have some lingering feelings for Jackie, and the two remain close. His relationship with Aria is often strained by the fact that they have to hide that they are together. He confesses to Ella that he loves Aria (though she misunderstands and believes he is talking about Spencer) when he comes to comfort Aria after her arrest. In \"Through Many Danger, Toils, and Snares\" we find out that Aria broke up with Ezra because of Jackie threatening to expose their relationship but they later get back together after Aria explains to Ezra that Jackie was the reason why she broke up with him. Ezra and Aria later tell Byron and Ella that they are a couple which leads him to getting punched by Mike (though it's told he only did it fearing what Byron what would have done instead). Ezra later tells Jackie, who comes into his office trying to convince him it'll never work out for him and Aria due to age difference and the fact she's still a teenager, to get out of his office, saying he will not let her do anything to harm or hurt Aria ever again and that he wants nothing more to do with Jackie herself. Aria continues to attempt to convince her parents to allow her to date Ezra but in the meantime they try to set her up with someone else. When Aria calls Ezra, he tells her not to call him again. The two later rekindle their relationship when Aria leaves him a voice mail telling Ezra that, if he doesn't meet up with her, their relationship is over for good. Ezra turns up at the last minute after a student tells him to 'be bold' and the two kiss in the rain. Aria decides not to tell her friends that the two are back together, hoping that, by keeping it from them, she can also keep it from \"A\". They later have sex in his apartment after Ezra finds out that he has been fired from Hollis. In season 3, Aria and Ezra celebrate their one-year anniversary. Their relationship seems to be going smoothly until Ezra's younger brother Wesley \"Wes\" drops by unexpectedly. Bumps are soon formed in their relationship when Aria learns of Ezra getting his high school girlfriend Maggie pregnant and his mother paying her to disappear from his life, even though he wanted to do the right thing. Aria tracks Maggie down and discovers that she kept the baby, who is now a healthy 7-year-old boy named Malcolm, whom Ezra finds out about from a distraught Spencer. This leads him to leave Rosewood and seek out Maggie and his son; Ezra is back in Rosewood but only one day after he's back he gets a phone call from Maggie; Mrs. Fitzgerald sold Maggie's condo. Maggie asked Ezra if she and Malcolm can stay in Rosewood near him for a couple of days. Later when Spencer is part of the A-team, she picks up Malcolm from his karate class but is actually kidnapping him. Aria frantically tries to find him and when she does he tells her that Aria's friend Alison picked him up. Ezra gets a job at Rosewood High as a substitute teacher. After all the incidents with Malcolm, Aria decides that it is best that her and Ezra break up just after kissing him on the school stairs. In season four Ezra starts teaching full-time at Rosewood High again. After Aria has a dream that Ezra got arrested because of her she decided they should see other people, something Ezra had already suggested. Ezra would still do anything for Aria, as whenever she is having trouble he still steps up to help her. Ezra finds out Malcolm isn't really his son. In the season four summer finale, the Liars find a lair that they believe belongs to \"A\" and we see that Ezra is the owner, leading fans to believe him to be \"A\". However, he reveals in \"Free Fall\" that he is writing a book about Alison. He is also Board Shorts but is not the guy Alison met with at Cape May known as \"Beach Hottie\". He is shot by someone in a black hoodie, whom he claims was Shana, in the season four finale but survives and later rekindles his relationship with Aria and begins helping them out with \"A\".

After the incident Byron did end all ties with Meredith because he felt threatened. But when \"A\" forces Aria to confess it was her, it gives now divorced Byron and Meredith another chance at a relationship. When Aria is forced to confess and apologize to Meredith, she returns the earring \"A\" gave her, which was taken from Alison's grave, only to find out the earring is not hers.

Spencer's biggest rival is her older sister, Melissa, and the two are constantly fighting over something. Their relationship is often strained by the fact that Spencer has a habit of crushing on Melissa's boyfriends. In the first season, she begins a relationship with fellow student and strained Rosewood student Toby Cavanaugh. Throughout the series, Spencer is revealed to be the biological daughter of Mary Drake and the sister of Charlotte Drake.\n\n===Aria Montgomery===\n{{main|Aria Montgomery}}\nConsidered the \"alternative\" one of the group, '''Aria Montgomery''', portrayed by [[Lucy Hale]], is more outgoing in fashion and what she sees as acceptable behavior. She moves back to Rosewood with her family after living in Iceland for a year. Before Alison's death, she and Alison discovered that Aria's father was having an affair with one of his former students, Meredith, who became his coworker at Hollis College. Alison encourages Aria to tell her mother the truth, but instead, Aria reluctantly agrees to keep her father's secret. On top of that, she finds herself involved with her high school English teacher, Ezra Fitz, after making out with him in a pub bathroom and discovering he was her English teacher on the first day of school.\n\n===Hanna Marin===\n{{main|Hanna Marin}}\nPretty and fierce, '''Hanna Marin''', portrayed by [[Ashley Benson]], is the diva and \"[[it girl]]\" of the group, having taken Alison's place as the most popular girl at Rosewood High. Prior to Alison's death, Hanna suffered from [[Bulimia nervosa|bulimia]], which Alison frequently teased her over. Since her parents divorced, Hanna permanently lives with her mother. She feels betrayed by her father, who has remarried, and she does not get along well with his new wife and daughter. When Hanna's mother falls upon financial hardship, she steals thousands of dollars from the bank she worked at, which Hanna is forced to keep a secret.\n\n===Emily Fields===\n{{main|Emily Fields}}\nThe \"[[Jock (athlete)|jock]]\" of the group, '''Emily Fields''', portrayed by [[Shay Mitchell]], is a highly competitive swimmer, considered the star of Rosewood's swimming team. She is shown as a sweet and shy young. For a short time, Emily lives with Hanna, after her mother moves to Texas to live with Emily's father, who is stationed in Fort Hood. She begins to question her sexuality because of her feeling for Alison, but later accepts the fact that she is a lesbian and starts to date girls. She eventually begins a relationship with Sara Harvey, until she discovers that she is an ally of the antagonist.\n\n===Alison DiLaurentis===\n{{main|Alison DiLaurentis}}\nThe former \"[[Queen bee (sociology)|queen bee]]\" of her clique, '''Alison DiLaurentis''', portrayed by [[Sasha Pieterse]], used to be the most popular girl in school before her disappearance and alleged death. Although she cared for her friends, she enjoyed using their deepest secrets against them to keep them in line. Charming and manipulative, Alison was skilled at finding ways to blackmail everyone, and many people hated her. She knew everybody's secrets, but since she's been gone her friends are beginning to realize how little they really knew about her. She is revealed to be alive and on the run from \"A.\"\n\n===Mona Vanderwaal===\n{{main|Mona Vanderwaal}}\nA former \"unpopular\" girl at Rosewood, '''Mona Vanderwaal''', portrayed by [[Janel Parrish]], longed to be accepted into Alison's group and was continuously mocked by her. After Alison's disappearance, Mona befriended Hanna and they underwent an \"extreme makeover\" together; as a result, they both became popular students. When \"A\" appears, Mona becomes jealous of Hanna rekindling her friendships with the other Liars. She dislikes Caleb and makes attempts to break Hanna and Caleb up, though to no avail. She becomes romantically involved with Noel, much to Hanna's disapproval, but is later dumped by him for Jenna. When \"A\" begins sending Mona threatening notes, she grows closer to the Liars. In the second-season finale, she is in fact revealed to actually be \"A\" when she and Spencer travel to the Lost Woods Resort to uncover \"A\"'s lair. She is committed to a mental institution, Radley, after being diagnosed with [[borderline personality disorder]].\n\n===\"A\"{{anchor|A|A.D.|Uber A}}===\n{{main|A (Pretty Little Liars)}}\nThe main [[antagonist]], \"'''A'''\" is stalking and torturing the Liars in relentless and creative ways and also threatens their friends and family. In the second-season finale, it is revealed that Mona is \"A\". She is also the one who stalked Alison before her disappearance. However, when she is sent to Radley sanitarium, she is visited by CeCe Drake, who offers her a partnership and takes over the team of \"A's\", known as the A-Team. The team consists of Mona, Toby, Spencer, Sara, Lucas, Melissa, Wilden, Jenna, Noel, and Wren. Five years later, Alex Drake takes over and becomes Uber A, known as \"A.D.\", and forms the A.D. Team, consisting of Jenna, Sydney, Aria, Wren, Mona, and Mary.\n\n==Acquaintances of Aria Montgomery==\nThe following characters are all family members and acquaintances of '''Aria Montgomery''', one of the protagonists of the series.\n\n===Family===\n* {{anchor|Ella Montgomery}}'''Ella Montgomery''' ([[Holly Marie Combs]]) (seasons 1 \u2013 7) is Aria's mother, as well as a teacher at Rosewood High. Ella believes in treating her children as friends, not as property. She has mentioned that she doesn't want to push into Aria's private life, and she thinks that Aria should be allowed to keep secrets. Ella was unaware of her husband's affair with a student until \"A\" sent her a letter. After asking Byron to move out, and his refusal, she left the home. Eventually, Aria found out her parents were secretly getting back together, and Ella decides to move back in. When her son, Mike, is depressed, she doesn't feel he needs medication, and remains somewhat in denial about his illness. She finally receives her wake-up call when he attacks her in his bedroom. When Ella found out Aria was dating Ezra, she was angry, but she believed Aria when she said she had broken it off, and tried to win her back her freedom, which Byron didn't think she deserved. Later, she finds out that Aria and Ezra are still together, and decides she is going to try to understand their relationship. Ella is aware of A, and tries to send Aria to a boarding school to get away. Aria is furious, and blackmails her mother into not going through with it. Ella tearfully tells Aria how ashamed she is, and how she doesn't know how to save their relationship. In season 3, she and Byron have divorced and Ella tries to move on with her life not knowing how. Aria creates a profile for her on a dating website under the nickname \"Hot Mamma.\" Ella is furious at Aria but later she likes the idea and starts dating again. She befriends and starts dating the owner of the brew who is much younger than her. In season 4, she leaves Rosewood so she can go live with her boyfriend in Europe but returns at the end of season 4.\n* {{anchor|Byron Montgomery}}'''Byron Montgomery''' ([[Chad Lowe]]) (seasons 1 \u2013 7) is Aria's father and a history professor at Hollis College. He asked Aria to keep his affair with a student, Meredith, a secret after Aria witnessed them kissing. Regretting the affair and wanting them to be a family again, Byron moves the family to Iceland for a year as a sabbatical. The relationship between Byron and Ella becomes strained after A sends her a letter revealing Byron's affair. After spending some time apart, Ella and Byron slowly begin to rebuild their relationship. When Mike becomes depressed, Byron reveals that his brother Scott, who committed suicide, also suffered from mental illness; Byron feels guilty for not doing anything to help his brother. Byron finds out that Ezra is involved in a relationship with Aria after they tell him and Ella and is furious about it. In an effort to get Ezra away from Aria, Byron recommends him for a job in New Orleans. He also plots to send Aria to an all girls boarding school in Vermont. When Aria threatens to reveal his affair to his boss, he backs off from her but gets Ezra fired from Hollis. In season 3, Byron and Ella have divorced and Ella has moved out of the house. Byron starts seeing Meredith again. He informs Aria that Meredith got a job at Rosewood High, were Aria attends and Ella teaches. In the Halloween episode, it is revealed by Garrett that Byron may have seen Alison on the night she died. Alison told him,\"you know what I'm capable of!\"\n* {{anchor|Mike Montgomery}}'''Mike Montgomery''' ([[Cody Christian]]) (seasons 1\u20132, 4\u20136) is Aria's younger brother. A lacrosse player, he suffers from a mental illness, which causes him to burst into fits of anger and later leads him to break into people's houses for fun, before he begins to shut down emotionally and withdraw completely from his family. He blames Aria for the trouble between their parents. Mike accidentally discovered that Jenna and Garrett knew each other when he stole a pot made Jenna from Garrett's house. Mike reveals to Aria that the only reason he punched Ezra was because after Ezra and Aria announced they are a couple, he feared what Byron would have done to hurt Ezra judging by the look on his face and thought, \"better I do it, than him.\" Throughout the rest of the series he appears to have improved after going to a therapist. It does not tell when or if he was still seeing his therapist. He seemed to forgive Aria and their relationship is better. He stopped being rebellious and more focused of his family's problems and helping them out. He is dating Mona Vanderwaal.\n\n===Friends===\n* {{anchor|Holden Strauss}}'''Holden Strauss''' ([[Shane Coffey]]) (seasons 2\u20133, 7) is a childhood friend of Aria's who returns with his family from a year abroad in Portugal in the middle of Season 2. He asks Aria out on a date, and discovers that she only agreed so she could get out of the house unsupervised and try to meet Ezra. Instead of becoming upset, he suggest that they continue the cover, though he remains secretive about what he does during their fake dates. We later find out that his secret is more serious than it seemed at first when he accidentally reveals a very large bruise on his stomach, but he tells Aria not to worry about it. He eventually tells her that he is doing Tae Kwan Do, a Korean martial art, and that his parents forbid him to keep training, that is why he needs a cover. The situation turns out to be more complicated, though, when Ella tells Aria that Holden has a heart condition that could kill him any time. Aria goes to watch one of Holden's fights and she sees how much he loves to fight. In the sixth episode in season 3, he attends the same church party as Hanna and when Emily arrives, he runs into her and sparks a conversation.

He quit his teaching position at Rosewood just before Noel threatened to expose Aria and Ezra's relationship.

Prior to Alison's death, she and Jenna had been rivals after Jenna turned down Alison's offer of friendship. Jenna was engaged in a power struggle with Alison before her death; after Jenna's accident, Alison visited her and blackmailed Jenna with the knowledge of her affair with Toby. Jenna claims to know \"exactly what kind of person [Alison] really was,\" hinting that she knows things about Alison that the girls did not. Jenna was a part of the N.A.T. club and later became romantically involved with Garrett Reynolds, as they both worked to \"take down\" the Liars. However, Jenna eventually breaks up with Garrett, and enters into a relationship with Noel Kahn. In the second season, Jenna undergoes surgery to fix her eyesight, and subsequently lies about the success of the surgery, leading everyone to believe she is still blind. The Liars discover that Jenna can see after Emily remembers being in Jenna's car, leading them to confront her. The Liars agree to keep her sight a secret; however, Jenna then reveals to everyone that she can \"now\" see. An accidental witness to Lyndon James' kidnapping of Maya, she leaves town after he discovers this. She returns in the Season 3 finale episode. It is then shown that she is in a relationship with Shana, to whom she reveals that her eyesight is getting worse and she will eventually lose her vision again. She is also linked to Melissa and Darren Wilden. In Season 4, it is revealed Melissa ordered Shana and Jenna to go to the lodge to spy on the Liars to see whom they were meeting, and that they didn't start the fire, Wilden did. At Wilden's funeral, she is shown wearing her sunglasses and holding hands with a man. It is revealed that man was a pilot named Nigel Wright, who flew Red Coat the night of the fire. He claims it was CeCe Drake. Later, he is seen making coffee for someone and says he's sorry and that he \"screwed up\". He also refers to this person as \"babe\", and she is revealed to be none other than Jenna, as we see Jenna's glasses and cane. Jenna was nearly drowned by \"A\"/Red Coat at Emily's birthday party. Shana seemed to believe it was CeCe and left town. Jenna returns in the 100th episode where she is revealed to be a part of Mona Vanderwaal's army and is friends with Sydney Driscoll. It is also revealed that Jenna truly cared for Shana. Sydney was volunteering at Jenna's blind school and when Jenna found out that Alison was returning she called Sydney for help. After Mona's supposed death Sydney and Jenna join Ali's army, believing that she was the one who killed Mona and fearing her. Jenna returns to Rosewood after Charlotte DiLaurentis' murder in 2017 and is now working for Uber A, as well working ''with'' Noel, Sydney, and Sara Harvey. It is also revealed that she was a part of the A-Team. She reveals that she was actually friends with Charlotte after her admission to Welby and was helping her track down Mary Drake. Jenna also knew Archer Dunhill and was working with him, as well. Jenna and Noel lure the Liars to a blind school to kill them, but their plan fails when Noel is killed and Jenna is knocked out by Mary Drake. Uber A rescues Jenna and takes her to an unknown lair, where she was assisting them in their final endgame. After the one year time jump, Jenna became a Life Skills Teacher at Rosewood High. She met with Alex Drake (who was pretending to be Spencer) and recognized her smell from when she was working for her. She called Toby and informed him that she didn't think Spencer was Spencer, leading them  to discover the truth about the twins.\n* {{anchor|Garrett Reynolds}}'''Garrett Reynolds''' ([[Yani Gellman]]) (seasons 1\u20133) is a police officer investigating the case of Alison DiLaurentis' death, who is initially assigned to trail Spencer, a suspect in Alison's death.

He was a member of N.A.T along with Jason and Ian, whom he went to high school with. Garrett and Jenna broke up. Aria and Spencer see Garrett watching them after they talk to the guy who Alison owed money to prior to her murder. Garrett then gets arrested for Alison's murder in front of Melissa.
