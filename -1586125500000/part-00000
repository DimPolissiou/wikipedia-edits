He is plagued by deafness, loneliness and personal trauma.  A new copyist, Anna Holtz ([[Diane Kruger]]) is engaged to help the composer finish preparing the score of his symphony for the first performance.  Anna is a young conservatory student and aspiring composer.  Her understanding of his work is such that she corrects mistakes he has made, while her personality opens a door into his private world.  Beethoven is initially skeptical, but he slowly comes to trust Anna's assistance and eventually grows to rely on her and view her with respect, and even with admiration. \n\nAnna Holtz (as Beethoven always refers to her) is sent to be his copyist, but due to her gender, is constantly thought less of, and is mistaken for a serving girl, maid, and even prostitute. Pushing past, though quite unhappily, from these assumptions, Anna proves herself to Beethoven, not only as a copyist, but also as his friend, and something of his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and heir as far as he is concerned. He gains much admiration of her, after she assists him by directing him, hidden among his musicians, as he simultaneously copies her movements to direct the orchestra during what would turn out to be his final concert. Though Anna agreed to her romantic interest, Martin Bauer, that she would help him complete his symphony, and then immediately leave after showing him her work, she instead continues to assist him as his copyist. After seeing the admiration she has gained from Beethoven, Anna proceeds to show him a piece of music that she composed. Beethoven tactlessly and unknowingly insults her. Anna, more than ready not to return, continues to stay with her great aunt and the nuns at the convent. Anna is surprised when Beethoven, desperate to keep Anna in his employment and under his tutelage, bursts into the convent and begs Anna, on his knees, to come back and work as his equal on both of their music. He begins to teach her about Romanticism, music, and mostly, how to allow her artistic side freedom. Continuing his infuriating behavior, Beethoven smashes the model of Martin's bridge he built for an engineer's competition, thereby ruining Martin as well. Anna, angry, confronts Beethoven, asking him if he had ever considered that she loved Martin. Beethoven replies, \"You don't love him.\" Upon hearing this, Anna angrily asks if she is supposed to love Beethoven instead. Beethoven again replies, \"No. You want to be me.\" From here, Anna agrees that Beethoven did the right thing, and continues to work with him, pushing him past his hardships and failures, and then staying by his bedside until he died. The movie ends though, with Anna finally embracing herself as an artist, unique from all other composers, including Beethoven, and readying herself for a promising future. \n\nThough the film is directed very abstractly, leaving room for the audience to view Anna and Beethoven's relationship as that of a chaste romance, the characters remain very platonic, and could much more easily be viewed as a strong and close friendship, bordering on Beethoven even being viewed as a father figure of Anna's.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Ed Harris]] as [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]\n*[[Diane Kruger]] as Anna Holtz\n*[[Matthew Goode]] as Martin Bauer\n*[[Phyllida Law]] as Mother Canisius\n*[[Joe Anderson (actor)|Joe Anderson]] as Karl van Beethoven\n*[[Ralph Riach]] as Wenzel Schlemmer\n*[[Bill Stewart (actor)|Bill Stewart]] as Rudy\n\n==Artistic license==\nThe working manuscript of the score of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony is attributed to two copyists,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3049061.stm |title=Beethoven's Ninth fetches \u00a32.1m |author=BBC News |date=22 May 2003 |publisher=BBC}}</ref> both of whom were male, not a single female as depicted in the film.

The Netscape web browser interface was identical on any computer. Netscape later experimented with prototypes of a web-based system which would enable users to access and edit their files anywhere across a network, no matter what computer or operating system they happened to be using. This did not escape the attention of [[Microsoft]], which viewed the [[commoditization]] of operating systems as a direct threat to its bottom line, i.e. a move from Windows to another operating system would yield a similar browsing experience thus reducing barriers to change. It is alleged that several Microsoft executives visited the Netscape campus in June 1995 to propose dividing the market (an allegation denied by Microsoft and, if true, would have breached antitrust laws), which would have allowed Microsoft to produce web browser software for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] while leaving all other operating systems to Netscape.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.pub.umich.edu/daily/1998/oct/10-20-98/news/news14.html| title=Government alleges illegal campaign by Microsoft|accessdate=July 14, 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060708210502/http://www.pub.umich.edu/daily/1998/oct/10-20-98/news/news14.html |archivedate = July 8, 2006}}</ref> Netscape refused the proposition.\n\nMicrosoft released version 1.0 of [[Internet Explorer]] as a part of the [[Windows 95]] [[Microsoft Plus!|Plus Pack]] add-on. According to former [[Spyglass, Inc.|Spyglass]] developer [[Eric Sink]], Internet Explorer was based not on NCSA Mosaic as commonly believed, but on a version of Mosaic developed at Spyglass<ref>{{cite web|url=http://biztech.ericsink.com/Browser_Wars.html|title=Memoirs from the Browser Wars|accessdate=July 14, 2006|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517004421/http://biztech.ericsink.com/Browser_Wars.html|archivedate=May 17, 2008|df=mdy-all}}</ref> (which itself was based upon NCSA Mosaic). Microsoft quickly released several successive versions of Internet Explorer, bundling them with Windows, never charging for them, financing their development and marketing with revenues from other areas of the company. This period of time became known as the [[browser wars]], in which Netscape Communicator and Internet Explorer added many new features and went through many version numbers (not always in a logical fashion) in attempts to outdo each other. But Internet Explorer had the upper hand, as the amount of manpower and capital dedicated to it eventually surpassed the resources available in Netscape's entire business. By version 3.0, IE was roughly a feature-for-feature equivalent of Netscape Communicator, and by version 4.0, it was generally considered to be more stable on Windows than on the Macintosh platform. Microsoft also targeted other Netscape products with free workalikes, such as the [[Internet Information Server]] (IIS), a web server which was bundled with Windows NT.\n\nNetscape could not compete with this strategy. In fact, it didn't attempt to. Netscape Navigator was not free to the general public until January 1998,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com/2100-1001-207681.html?legacy=cnet|title=Netscape cuts prices on retail products|author=Alex Lash|first=|date=|website=|publisher=C-Net|accessdate=February 23, 2008}}</ref> while Internet Explorer and IIS have always been free or came bundled with an operating system and/or other applications. Meanwhile, Netscape faced increasing criticism for the bugs in its products; critics claimed that the company suffered from \"[[Creeping featurism|featuritis]]\" \u2013 putting a higher priority on adding new features than on making them work properly. This was particularly true with Netscape Navigator 2, which was only on the market for five months in early 1996 before being replaced by Netscape Navigator 3. The tide of public opinion, having once lauded Netscape as the [[David]] to Microsoft's [[Goliath]], steadily turned negative, especially when Netscape experienced its first bad quarter at the end of 1997 and underwent a large round of layoffs in January 1998. Later, former Netscape executives [[Mike Homer]] and [[Peter Currie (businessman)|Peter Currie]] described the period as \"hectic and crazy\" and that the company was undone by factors both internal and external.<ref name=twsOctE23>{{cite news\n |author=Alan T.

Netscape publicly released the [[source code]] of Netscape Communicator 5.0 in the hopes that it would become a popular open source project. It placed this code under the [[Netscape Public License]], which was similar to the [[GNU General Public License]] but allowed Netscape to continue to publish proprietary work containing the publicly released code. However, after having released the Communicator 5.0 code this way, Netscape proceeded to work on Communicator 5.0 which was focused on improving email and enterprise functionality. It eventually became clear that the Communicator 5.0 browser was too difficult to develop, and open source development was halted on this codebase. Instead, the open source development shifted to a next-generation browser built from scratch. Using the newly built [[Gecko (layout engine)|Gecko]] [[Browser engine|layout engine]], this browser had a much more modular architecture than Communicator 5.0 and was, therefore, easier to develop with a large number of programmers. It also included an XML user interface language named [[XUL]] that allowed single development of a user interface that ran on Windows, Macintosh, and Unix.

Microsoft|antitrust case]] against Microsoft in May 1998. Netscape was not a plaintiff in the case, though its executives were subpoenaed and it contributed much material to the case, including the entire contents of the 'Bad Attitude' internal discussion forum.<ref name=\"wired\">{{cite news | url=https://www.wired.com/news/politics/0,1283,14743,00.html| title=Microsoft Subpoenas Bad Attitude|accessdate=July 14, 2006 | work=Wired| date=September 1, 1998}}</ref> In October 1998, Netscape acquired web directory site [[DMOZ|NewHoo]] for the sum of US$1 million, renamed it the Open Directory Project, and released its database under an [[open content]] license.\n\n===Acquisition by America Online===\n{{More citations needed section|date=October 2008}}\nOn November 24, 1998, [[America Online]] (AOL) announced it would acquire Netscape Communications in a tax-free stock-swap valued at US$4.2 billion.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://news.cnet.com/2100-1023-218360.html| title=AOL buys Netscape for $4.2 billion}}</ref> During this time, Andreessen's view of Netscape changed; to him, it was no longer just a browser, intranet, extranet, or a software company, but rather an amalgamation of products and services.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = Building a Company on Internet Time: Lessons from Netscape|last = Yoffie|first = David B.|date = April 1999|journal = California Management Review|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}</ref> By the time the deal closed on March 17, 1999, it was valued at US$10 billion.<ref name=AOL1999/><ref name=Morn1999/> This merger was ridiculed by many who believed that the two corporate cultures could not possibly mesh; one of its most prominent critics was longtime Netscape developer [[Jamie Zawinski]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.jwz.org/gruntle/aol.html | title=netscape and aol}}</ref> The acquisition was seen as a way for AOL to gain a bargaining chip against Microsoft, to let it become less dependent on the Internet Explorer web browser. Others believed that AOL was interested in Netcenter, or Netscape's web properties, which drew some of the highest traffic worldwide. Eventually, Netscape's server products and its Professional Services group became part of [[iPlanet]], a joint marketing and development alliance between AOL and Sun Microsystems. On November 14, 2000, AOL released Netscape 6, based on the Mozilla 0.6 source code. (Version 5 was skipped.) Unfortunately, Mozilla 0.6 was far from being stable yet, and so the effect of Netscape 6 was to further drive people away from the Netscape brand. It was not until August 2001 that Netscape 6.1 appeared, based on Mozilla 0.9.2 which was significantly more robust. A year later came Netscape 7.0, based on the Mozilla 1.0 core.\n\n=== Disbanding ===\nDuring the acquisition of Netscape by AOL, joint development and marketing of Netscape software products would occur through the Sun-Netscape Alliance. The software, in the newly branded iPlanet, included \"messaging and calendar, collaboration, web, application, directory, and certificate servers\", as well as \"production-ready applications for e-commerce, including commerce exchange, procurement, selling, and billing.\"<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sun-netscape-alliance-announces-new-iplanettm-brand-and-marketing-campaign-73653107.html| title=Sun-Netscape Alliance Announces New iPlanet(TM) Brand and Marketing Campaign| accessdate=July 7, 2012| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120919141754/http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sun-netscape-alliance-announces-new-iplanettm-brand-and-marketing-campaign-73653107.html| archive-date=September 19, 2012| url-status=dead}}</ref> In March 2002, when the alliance was ended, \"iPlanet became a division of Sun...

It featured a green and grey interface. In November 2007, IE had 77.4% of the browser market, Firefox 16.0%, and Netscape 0.6%, according to Net Applications, an Internet metrics firm.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.informationweek.com/news/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=205204433 |title=AOL Kills Netscape's Future, Leaves Firefox to Battle IE |accessdate=December 29, 2007 |author=Gonsalves, Antone |date= December 28, 2007|website=Informationweek.com |publisher=CMP Media LLC}}</ref>  On December 28, 2007, AOL announced that on February 1, 2008 it would drop support for the Netscape web browser and would no longer develop new releases.<ref name=BrowserEndFeb/> The date was later extended to March 1<ref name=BrowserEndMar/> to allow a major security update and to add a tool to assist users in migrating to other browsers.

The first [[beta version]]s were released in 1994 and were called Mosaic and later Mosaic Netscape. Then, a legal challenge from the [[National Center for Supercomputing Applications]] (makers of [[NCSA Mosaic]]), which many of Netscape's founders used to develop, led to the name Netscape Navigator. The company's name also changed from Mosaic Communications Corporation to Netscape Communications Corporation.\n\nThe browser was easily the most advanced available{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} and so was an instant success, becoming a market leader while still in beta.<ref name=\":0\"/> Netscape's feature-count and market share continued to grow rapidly after version 1.0 was released. Version 2.0 added a full email reader called Netscape Mail, thus transforming Netscape from a single-purpose web browser to an [[Internet suite]]. The main distinguishing feature of the email client was its ability to display [[HTML email]]. During this period, the entire suite was called Netscape Navigator.\n\nVersion 3.0 of Netscape (the first beta was codenamed \"Atlas\") was the first to face any serious competition in the form of [[Microsoft]] [[Internet Explorer]] 3.0.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2014/05/10/history-of-netscape/|title=Whatever happened to Netscape?|website=Engadget|access-date=2017-03-22}}</ref>{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} But Netscape remained the most popular browser at that time.\n\nNetscape also released a Gold version of Navigator 3.0 that incorporated [[WYSIWYG]] editing with [[drag and drop]] between web editor and email components.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.intercom.co.cr/www/research/1996/0910.htm|title=Netscape Navigator Gold 3.0 Now Available, Adding Momentum to Netscape Client Software|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020102517/http://www.intercom.co.cr/www/research/1996/0910.htm|archivedate=October 20, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n====Netscape Communicator (versions 4.0\u20134.8)====\n[[Image:OS2 Netscape Communicator 4.61.png|thumb|Netscape Communicator 4.61 for OS/2 Warp]]\n{{Main|Netscape Communicator}}\n\nNetscape 4 addressed the problem of Netscape Navigator being used as both the name of the suite and the browser contained within it by renaming the suite to Netscape Communicator. After five preview releases in 1996\u20131997, Netscape released the final version of Netscape Communicator in June 1997. This version, more or less based on Netscape Navigator 3 Code, updated and added new features. The new suite was successful, despite increasing competition from Internet Explorer (IE) 4.0 and problems with the outdated browser core. IE was slow and unstable on the Mac platform until version 4.5.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} Despite this, Apple entered into an agreement with Microsoft to make IE the default browser on new Mac OS installations, a further blow to Netscape's prestige.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} The Communicator suite was made up of Netscape Navigator, [[Netscape Mail & Newsgroups]], Netscape Address Book and [[Netscape Composer]] (an HTML editor).\n\nOn January 22, 1998, [[Netscape Communications Corporation]] announced that all future versions of its software would be available free of charge and developed by an [[open-source-software movement|open source]] community, Mozilla.<ref>https://blog.lizardwrangler.com/2008/01/22/january-22-1998-the-beginning-of-mozilla/</ref> [[Netscape 5|Netscape Communicator 5.0]] was announced (codenamed \"Gromit\"). However, its release was greatly delayed, and meanwhile, there were newer versions of Internet Explorer, starting with [[Internet Explorer 4|version 4]]. These had more features than the old Netscape version, including better support of [[HTML]] 4, [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]], [[Document Object Model|DOM]], and [[ECMAScript]]; eventually, the more advanced [[Internet Explorer 5.0]] became the market leader.\n\nIn October 1998, Netscape Communicator 4.5 was released. It featured various functionality improvements, especially in the [[Netscape Mail & Newsgroups|Mail and Newsgroups]] component, but did not update the browser core, whose functionality was essentially identical to that of version 4.08. One month later, [[Netscape Communications Corporation]] was bought by [[AOL]]. In November, work on Netscape 5.0 was canceled in favor of developing a [[Rewrite (programming)|completely new program from scratch]].\n\n===Mozilla-based releases===\n\n====Netscape 6 (versions 6.0\u20136.2.3)====\n{{Main|Netscape 6}}\n\nIn 1998, an informal group called the [[Mozilla Organization]] was formed and largely funded by Netscape (the vast majority of programmers working on the code were paid by Netscape) to coordinate the development of Netscape 5 (codenamed \"Gromit\"), which would be based on the Communicator source code. However, the aging Communicator code proved difficult to work with and the decision was taken to scrap Netscape 5 and re-write the source code. The re-written source code was in the form of the [[Mozilla Application Suite|Mozilla]] web browser, on which, with a few additions, Netscape 6 was based.\n\nThis decision meant that Netscape's next major version was severely delayed. In the meantime, Netscape was taken over by AOL who, acting under pressure from the [[Web Standards Project]], forced its new division to release Netscape 6.0 in 2000. The suite again consisted of Netscape Navigator and the other Communicator components, with the addition of a built-in [[AOL Instant Messenger]] client, Netscape Instant Messenger. However, it was clear that Netscape 6 was not yet ready for release and it flopped badly. It was based on Mozilla 0.6, which was not ready to be used by the general public yet due to many serious bugs that would cause it to crash often or render web pages slowly. Later versions of Netscape 6 were much-improved {{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} (especially 6.2.x was regarded as a good release){{who|date=June 2013}}, but the browser still struggled to make an impact on a disappointed community.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}\n\n====Netscape 7 (versions 7.0\u20137.2)====\n{{Main|Netscape 7}}\n\nNetscape 7.0 (based on Mozilla 1.0.1) was released in August 2002 as a direct continuation of Netscape 6 with very similar components. It picked up a few users, but was still very much a minority browser. It did, however, come with the popular [[AOL Radio|Radio@Netscape]] Internet radio client. AOL had decided to deactivate Mozilla's popup-blocker functionality in Netscape 7.0, which created an outrage in the community. AOL reversed the decision and allowed Netscape to reinstate the popup-blocker for Netscape 7.01. Netscape also introduced a new AOL-free-version (without the usual AOL add-ons) of the browser suite. Netscape 7.1 (codenamed \"Buffy\" and based on Mozilla 1.4) was released in June 2003.\n\nIn 2003, AOL closed down its Netscape division and laid-off or reassigned all of Netscape's employees. Mozilla.org continued, however, as the independent [[Mozilla Foundation]], taking on many of Netscape's ex-employees. AOL continued to develop Netscape in-house (with help from [[Sun Microsystems|Sun's]] [[Beijing]] development center<ref name=Beijing/>), but, due to there being no staff committed to it, improvements were minimal. One year later, in August 2004, the last version based on Mozilla was released: Netscape 7.2, based on Mozilla 1.7.2.\n\nAfter an official poll posted on Netscape's community support board in late 2006, speculation arose of the Netscape 7 series of suites being fully supported and updated by Netscape's in-house development team.<ref>[http://community.netscape.com/n/pfx/forum.aspx?tsn=1&nav=messages&webtag=ws-nscpbrowser&tid=6590 Netscape Community Announcement \u2013 Netscape 7.2] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090109014643/http://community.netscape.com/n/pfx/forum.aspx?tsn=1&nav=messages&webtag=ws-nscpbrowser&tid=6590 |date=January 9, 2009 }} Retrieved on February 8, 2007</ref><ref>[http://community.netscape.com/n/pfx/forum.aspx?tsn=1&nav=messages&webtag=ws-nscpbrowser&tid=6303 Netscape Community poll \u2013 Should Netscape continue to update 7.2?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090109100452/http://community.netscape.com/n/pfx/forum.aspx?tsn=1&nav=messages&webtag=ws-nscpbrowser&tid=6303 |date=January 9, 2009 }} Retrieved on February 8, 2007</ref><ref>[http://www.mozillazine.org/talkback.html?article=20397 Mozillazine \u2013 Netscape 9 announced] Retrieved on February 8, 2007</ref> This was not to be.\n\n===Mozilla Firefox-based releases===\n\n====Netscape Browser (version 8.0\u20138.1.3)====\nBetween 2005 and 2007, Netscape's releases became known as ''Netscape Browser''. AOL chose to base Netscape Browser on the relatively successful [[Mozilla Firefox]], a re-written version of Mozilla produced by the Mozilla Foundation. This release is not a full Internet suite as before, but is solely a web browser.\n\nOther controversial decisions include the browser only being released for [[Microsoft Windows]] and featuring both the [[Gecko (layout engine)|Gecko]] [[Web browser engine|rendering engine]] of previous releases and the [[Trident (layout engine)|Trident]] engine used in Internet Explorer, and switching between them based on a \"compatibility list\" that came with the browser. This effectively exposed users to the security vulnerabilities in both and resulted in a completely different user experience based on which site they were on. Examples are handling of right-to-left or bi-directional text, user interface widgets, bugs and web standards violations in Trident, etc. On top of this, Netscape Browser 8 even broke Internet Explorer's ability to open XML files by damaging a [[Windows Registry]] key, and would do so every time it was opened, even if the user fixed it manually.<ref>https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/ie/2005/05/25/netscape-8-and-internet-explorers-xml-rendering/</ref>\n\nAOL's acquisition of Netscape Communications in November

The portal of [https://web.archive.org/web/20070926212815/http://www.netscape.de/ Netscape Germany] was shut down in June 2008.\n\nThe Netscape Blog was written by Netscape employees discussing the latest on Netscape products and services. Netscape NewsQuake (formerly ''Netscape Reports'') is Netscape's news and opinion blog, including video clips and discussions. As of January 2012, no new posts have been made on either of these blogs since August 2008.\n\n===Netscape technologies===\nNetscape created the [[JavaScript]] web page scripting language. It also pioneered the development of [[push technology]], which effectively allowed websites to send regular updates of information (weather, stock updates, package tracking, etc.) directly to a user's desktop (aka \"webtop\"); Netscape's implementation of this was named Netcaster.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} However, businesses quickly recognized the use of push technology to deliver ads to users that annoyed them, so Netcaster was short-lived.\n\nNetscape was notable for its [[cross-platform]] efforts. Its client software continued to be made available for Windows ([[Windows 3.1x|3.1]], [[Windows 95|95]], [[Windows 98|98]], [[Windows NT|NT]]), Macintosh, Linux, [[OS/2]], [[BeOS]], and many versions of Unix including [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]], [[Solaris (operating system)|Sun Solaris]], [[Berkeley Software Design|BSDI]], [[IRIX]], [[IBM AIX]], and [[HP-UX]]. Its server software generally was only available for Unix and Windows NT, though some of its servers were made available on Linux, and a version of Netscape FastTrack Server was made available for Windows 95/98. Today, most of Netscape's server offerings live on as the [[Sun Java System]], formerly under the [[Sun ONE]] branding. Although Netscape Browser 8 was Windows only, multi-platform support exists in the [[Netscape Navigator 9]] series of browsers.<ref name=\"wired\" />\n\n==Current services==\n{{Update|inaccurate=yes|date=October 2009}}\n\n===Netscape Internet Service===\nNetscape ISP is a dial-up Internet service once offered at US$9.95 per month.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.getnetscape.com/ | title=GetNetscape Home Page | accessdate=March 20, 2008}}</ref> The company serves web pages in a compressed format to increase effective speeds up to 1300 kbit/s (average 500 kbit/s).

Netscape ISP is no longer actively marketed, but for a time its advertising was aimed at a younger demographic, e.g., college students, and people just out of school, as an affordable way to gain access to the Internet.\n\n===Netscape.com===\nNetscape always drove lots of traffic from various links included in the browser menus to its web properties. Some say it was very late to leverage this traffic<ref>[http://news.cnet.com/Netscape-late-to-leverage-traffic/2100-1023_3-206685.html Netscape late to leverage traffic - CNET News]. News.cnet.com.

Two continuations of the original Netscape.com portal are available; Compuserve.com, the Web site of [[Compuserve]], and ISP.Netscape.com, the website for Netscape's dial-up discount ISP service, continue to use the Netscape.com layout as it was before June 2006. Of the two, only the latter explicitly uses the Netscape branding.\n\nNetscape.com is currently an AOL Netscape-branded mirror duplicate of the AOL.com portal with the [[URL]], replacing the former social news website in September 2007. The social news site moved to the Propeller.com domain, where it stayed until ending operations in October 2010. It features facilities such as news, sports, horoscopes, dating, movies, music and more. The change has come to much criticism amongst many site users, because the site has effectively become an AOL clone, and simply re-directs to regional AOL portals in some areas across the globe. Netscape's exclusive features, such as the Netscape Blog, Netscape NewsQuake, Netscape Navigator, My Netscape and Netscape Community pages, are less accessible from the AOL Netscape designed portal and in some countries not accessible at all without providing a full URL or completing an [[Internet search]].<ref>[http://community.netscape.com/n/pfx/forum.aspx?webtag=ws-nscpbrowser&nav=messages&tid=9781&tsn= Netscape Community responses] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071015195056/http://community.netscape.com/n/pfx/forum.aspx?webtag=ws-nscpbrowser&nav=messages&tid=9781&tsn= |date=October 15, 2007 }}.

The stock's value soared to US$75 during the first day of trading, nearly a record for first-day gain. The stock closed at US$58.25, which gave Netscape a market value of US$2.9 billion.

The Netscape web browser interface was identical on any computer. Netscape later experimented with prototypes of a web-based system which would enable users to access and edit their files anywhere across a network, no matter what computer or operating system they happened to be using. This did not escape the attention of [[Microsoft]], which viewed the [[commoditization]] of operating systems as a direct threat to its bottom line, i.e. a move from Windows to another operating system would yield a similar browsing experience thus reducing barriers to change. It is alleged that several Microsoft executives visited the Netscape campus in June 1995 to propose dividing the market (an allegation denied by Microsoft and, if true, would have breached antitrust laws), which would have allowed Microsoft to produce web browser software for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] while leaving all other operating systems to Netscape.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.pub.umich.edu/daily/1998/oct/10-20-98/news/news14.html| title=Government alleges illegal campaign by Microsoft|accessdate=July 14, 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060708210502/http://www.pub.umich.edu/daily/1998/oct/10-20-98/news/news14.html |archivedate = July 8, 2006}}</ref> Netscape refused the proposition.\n\nMicrosoft released version 1.0 of [[Internet Explorer]] as a part of the [[Windows 95]] [[Microsoft Plus!|Plus Pack]] add-on. According to former [[Spyglass, Inc.|Spyglass]] developer [[Eric Sink]], Internet Explorer was based not on NCSA Mosaic as commonly believed, but on a version of Mosaic developed at Spyglass<ref>{{cite web|url=http://biztech.ericsink.com/Browser_Wars.html|title=Memoirs from the Browser Wars|accessdate=July 14, 2006|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517004421/http://biztech.ericsink.com/Browser_Wars.html|archivedate=May 17, 2008|df=mdy-all}}</ref> (which itself was based upon NCSA Mosaic). Microsoft quickly released several successive versions of Internet Explorer, bundling them with Windows, never charging for them, financing their development and marketing with revenues from other areas of the company. This period of time became known as the [[browser wars]], in which Netscape Communicator and Internet Explorer added many new features and went through many version numbers (not always in a logical fashion) in attempts to outdo each other. But Internet Explorer had the upper hand, as the amount of manpower and capital dedicated to it eventually surpassed the resources available in Netscape's entire business. By version 3.0, IE was roughly a feature-for-feature equivalent of Netscape Communicator, and by version 4.0, it was generally considered to be more stable on Windows than on the Macintosh platform. Microsoft also targeted other Netscape products with free workalikes, such as the [[Internet Information Server]] (IIS), a web server which was bundled with Windows NT.\n\nNetscape could not compete with this strategy. In fact, it didn't attempt to. Netscape Navigator was not free to the general public until January 1998,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com/2100-1001-207681.html?legacy=cnet|title=Netscape cuts prices on retail products|author=Alex Lash|first=|date=|website=|publisher=C-Net|accessdate=February 23, 2008}}</ref> while Internet Explorer and IIS have always been free or came bundled with an operating system and/or other applications. Meanwhile, Netscape faced increasing criticism for the bugs in its products; critics claimed that the company suffered from \"[[Creeping featurism|featuritis]]\" \u2013 putting a higher priority on adding new features than on making them work properly. This was particularly true with Netscape Navigator 2, which was only on the market for five months in early 1996 before being replaced by Netscape Navigator 3. The tide of public opinion, having once lauded Netscape as the [[David]] to Microsoft's [[Goliath]], steadily turned negative, especially when Netscape experienced its first bad quarter at the end of 1997 and underwent a large round of layoffs in January 1998. Later, former Netscape executives [[Mike Homer]] and [[Peter Currie (businessman)|Peter Currie]] described the period as \"hectic and crazy\" and that the company was undone by factors both internal and external.<ref name=twsOctE23>{{cite news\n |author=Alan T.

Netscape publicly released the [[source code]] of Netscape Communicator 5.0 in the hopes that it would become a popular open source project. It placed this code under the [[Netscape Public License]], which was similar to the [[GNU General Public License]] but allowed Netscape to continue to publish proprietary work containing the publicly released code. However, after having released the Communicator 5.0 code this way, Netscape proceeded to work on Communicator 5.0 which was focused on improving email and enterprise functionality. It eventually became clear that the Communicator 5.0 browser was too difficult to develop, and open source development was halted on this codebase. Instead, the open source development shifted to a next-generation browser built from scratch. Using the newly built [[Gecko (layout engine)|Gecko]] [[Browser engine|layout engine]], this browser had a much more modular architecture than Communicator 5.0 and was, therefore, easier to develop with a large number of programmers. It also included an XML user interface language named [[XUL]] that allowed single development of a user interface that ran on Windows, Macintosh, and Unix.  The slogan for this open sourcing effort, \"Free The Lizard\", carried comedic sexual overtones.<!--Connotation of a man unzipping.-->\n\nThe [[United States Department of Justice]] filed an [[United States v. Microsoft|antitrust case]] against Microsoft in May 1998. Netscape was not a plaintiff in the case, though its executives were subpoenaed and it contributed much material to the case, including the entire contents of the 'Bad Attitude' internal discussion forum.<ref name=\"wired\">{{cite news | url=https://www.wired.com/news/politics/0,1283,14743,00.html| title=Microsoft Subpoenas Bad Attitude|accessdate=July 14, 2006 | work=Wired| date=September 1, 1998}}</ref> In October 1998, Netscape acquired web directory site [[DMOZ|NewHoo]] for the sum of US$1 million, renamed it the Open Directory Project, and released its database under an [[open content]] license.\n\n===Acquisition by America Online===\n{{More citations needed section|date=October 2008}}\nOn November 24, 1998, [[America Online]] (AOL) announced it would acquire Netscape Communications in a tax-free stock-swap valued at US$4.2 billion.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://news.cnet.com/2100-1023-218360.html| title=AOL buys Netscape for $4.2 billion}}</ref> During this time, Andreessen's view of Netscape changed; to him, it was no longer just a browser, intranet, extranet, or a software company, but rather an amalgamation of products and services.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = Building a Company on Internet Time: Lessons from Netscape|last = Yoffie|first = David B.|date = April 1999|journal = California Management Review|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}</ref> By the time the deal closed on March 17, 1999, it was valued at US$10 billion.<ref name=AOL1999/><ref name=Morn1999/> This merger was ridiculed by many who believed that the two corporate cultures could not possibly mesh; one of its most prominent critics was longtime Netscape developer [[Jamie Zawinski]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.jwz.org/gruntle/aol.html | title=netscape and aol}}</ref> The acquisition was seen as a way for AOL to gain a bargaining chip against Microsoft, to let it become less dependent on the Internet Explorer web browser. Others believed that AOL was interested in Netcenter, or Netscape's web properties, which drew some of the highest traffic worldwide. Eventually, Netscape's server products and its Professional Services group became part of [[iPlanet]], a joint marketing and development alliance between AOL and Sun Microsystems. On November 14, 2000, AOL released Netscape 6, based on the Mozilla 0.6 source code. (Version 5 was skipped.) Unfortunately, Mozilla 0.6 was far from being stable yet, and so the effect of Netscape 6 was to further drive people away from the Netscape brand. It was not until August 2001 that Netscape 6.1 appeared, based on Mozilla 0.9.2 which was significantly more robust. A year later came Netscape 7.0, based on the Mozilla 1.0 core.\n\n=== Disbanding ===\nDuring the acquisition of Netscape by AOL, joint development and marketing of Netscape software products would occur through the Sun-Netscape Alliance. The software, in the newly branded iPlanet, included \"messaging and calendar, collaboration, web, application, directory, and certificate servers\", as well as \"production-ready applications for e-commerce, including commerce exchange, procurement, selling, and billing.\"<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sun-netscape-alliance-announces-new-iplanettm-brand-and-marketing-campaign-73653107.html| title=Sun-Netscape Alliance Announces New iPlanet(TM) Brand and Marketing Campaign| accessdate=July 7, 2012| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120919141754/http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sun-netscape-alliance-announces-new-iplanettm-brand-and-marketing-campaign-73653107.html| archive-date=September 19, 2012| url-status=dead}}</ref> In March 2002, when the alliance was ended, \"iPlanet became a division of Sun...

Some content from DevEdge has been republished at the [[Mozilla]] website.\n\nAfter the [[Sun acquisition by Oracle]] in January 2010, Oracle continued to sell iPlanet branded applications, which originated from Netscape.<ref>[http://www.oracle.com/us/products/middleware/application-server/050735.html Oracle Web Tier\"].

The first [[beta version]]s were released in 1994 and were called Mosaic and later Mosaic Netscape. Then, a legal challenge from the [[National Center for Supercomputing Applications]] (makers of [[NCSA Mosaic]]), which many of Netscape's founders used to develop, led to the name Netscape Navigator. The company's name also changed from Mosaic Communications Corporation to Netscape Communications Corporation.\n\nThe browser was easily the most advanced available{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} and so was an instant success, becoming a market leader while still in beta.<ref name=\":0\"/> Netscape's feature-count and market share continued to grow rapidly after version 1.0 was released. Version 2.0 added a full email reader called Netscape Mail, thus transforming Netscape from a single-purpose web browser to an [[Internet suite]]. The main distinguishing feature of the email client was its ability to display [[HTML email]]. During this period, the entire suite was called Netscape Navigator.\n\nVersion 3.0 of Netscape (the first beta was codenamed \"Atlas\") was the first to face any serious competition in the form of [[Microsoft]] [[Internet Explorer]] 3.0.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2014/05/10/history-of-netscape/|title=Whatever happened to Netscape?|website=Engadget|access-date=2017-03-22}}</ref>{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} But Netscape remained the most popular browser at that time.\n\nNetscape also released a Gold version of Navigator 3.0 that incorporated [[WYSIWYG]] editing with [[drag and drop]] between web editor and email components.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.intercom.co.cr/www/research/1996/0910.htm|title=Netscape Navigator Gold 3.0 Now Available, Adding Momentum to Netscape Client Software|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020102517/http://www.intercom.co.cr/www/research/1996/0910.htm|archivedate=October 20, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n====Netscape Communicator (versions 4.0\u20134.8)====\n[[Image:OS2 Netscape Communicator 4.61.png|thumb|Netscape Communicator 4.61 for OS/2 Warp]]\n{{Main|Netscape Communicator}}\n\nNetscape 4 addressed the problem of Netscape Navigator being used as both the name of the suite and the browser contained within it by renaming the suite to Netscape Communicator. After five preview releases in 1996\u20131997, Netscape released the final version of Netscape Communicator in June 1997. This version, more or less based on Netscape Navigator 3 Code, updated and added new features. The new suite was successful, despite increasing competition from Internet Explorer (IE) 4.0 and problems with the outdated browser core. IE was slow and unstable on the Mac platform until version 4.5.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} Despite this, Apple entered into an agreement with Microsoft to make IE the default browser on new Mac OS installations, a further blow to Netscape's prestige.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} The Communicator suite was made up of Netscape Navigator, [[Netscape Mail & Newsgroups]], Netscape Address Book and [[Netscape Composer]] (an HTML editor).\n\nOn January 22, 1998, [[Netscape Communications Corporation]] announced that all future versions of its software would be available free of charge and developed by an [[open-source-software movement|open source]] community, Mozilla.<ref>https://blog.lizardwrangler.com/2008/01/22/january-22-1998-the-beginning-of-mozilla/</ref> [[Netscape 5|Netscape Communicator 5.0]] was announced (codenamed \"Gromit\"). However, its release was greatly delayed, and meanwhile, there were newer versions of Internet Explorer, starting with [[Internet Explorer 4|version 4]]. These had more features than the old Netscape version, including better support of [[HTML]] 4, [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]], [[Document Object Model|DOM]], and [[ECMAScript]]; eventually, the more advanced [[Internet Explorer 5.0]] became the market leader.\n\nIn October 1998, Netscape Communicator 4.5 was released. It featured various functionality improvements, especially in the [[Netscape Mail & Newsgroups|Mail and Newsgroups]] component, but did not update the browser core, whose functionality was essentially identical to that of version 4.08. One month later, [[Netscape Communications Corporation]] was bought by [[AOL]]. In November, work on Netscape 5.0 was canceled in favor of developing a [[Rewrite (programming)|completely new program from scratch]].\n\n===Mozilla-based releases===\n\n====Netscape 6 (versions 6.0\u20136.2.3)====\n{{Main|Netscape 6}}\n\nIn 1998, an informal group called the [[Mozilla Organization]] was formed and largely funded by Netscape (the vast majority of programmers working on the code were paid by Netscape) to coordinate the development of Netscape 5 (codenamed \"Gromit\"), which would be based on the Communicator source code. However, the aging Communicator code proved difficult to work with and the decision was taken to scrap Netscape 5 and re-write the source code. The re-written source code was in the form of the [[Mozilla Application Suite|Mozilla]] web browser, on which, with a few additions, Netscape 6 was based.\n\nThis decision meant that Netscape's next major version was severely delayed. In the meantime, Netscape was taken over by AOL who, acting under pressure from the [[Web Standards Project]], forced its new division to release Netscape 6.0 in 2000. The suite again consisted of Netscape Navigator and the other Communicator components, with the addition of a built-in [[AOL Instant Messenger]] client, Netscape Instant Messenger. However, it was clear that Netscape 6 was not yet ready for release and it flopped badly. It was based on Mozilla 0.6, which was not ready to be used by the general public yet due to many serious bugs that would cause it to crash often or render web pages slowly. Later versions of Netscape 6 were much-improved {{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} (especially 6.2.x was regarded as a good release){{who|date=June 2013}}, but the browser still struggled to make an impact on a disappointed community.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}\n\n====Netscape 7 (versions 7.0\u20137.2)====\n{{Main|Netscape 7}}\n\nNetscape 7.0 (based on Mozilla 1.0.1) was released in August 2002 as a direct continuation of Netscape 6 with very similar components. It picked up a few users, but was still very much a minority browser. It did, however, come with the popular [[AOL Radio|Radio@Netscape]] Internet radio client. AOL had decided to deactivate Mozilla's popup-blocker functionality in Netscape 7.0, which created an outrage in the community. AOL reversed the decision and allowed Netscape to reinstate the popup-blocker for Netscape 7.01. Netscape also introduced a new AOL-free-version (without the usual AOL add-ons) of the browser suite. Netscape 7.1 (codenamed \"Buffy\" and based on Mozilla 1.4) was released in June 2003.\n\nIn 2003, AOL closed down its Netscape division and laid-off or reassigned all of Netscape's employees. Mozilla.org continued, however, as the independent [[Mozilla Foundation]], taking on many of Netscape's ex-employees. AOL continued to develop Netscape in-house (with help from [[Sun Microsystems|Sun's]] [[Beijing]] development center<ref name=Beijing/>), but, due to there being no staff committed to it, improvements were minimal. One year later, in August 2004, the last version based on Mozilla was released: Netscape 7.2, based on Mozilla 1.7.2.\n\nAfter an official poll posted on Netscape's community support board in late 2006, speculation arose of the Netscape 7 series of suites being fully supported and updated by Netscape's in-house development team.<ref>[http://community.netscape.com/n/pfx/forum.aspx?tsn=1&nav=messages&webtag=ws-nscpbrowser&tid=6590 Netscape Community Announcement \u2013 Netscape 7.2] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090109014643/http://community.netscape.com/n/pfx/forum.aspx?tsn=1&nav=messages&webtag=ws-nscpbrowser&tid=6590 |date=January 9, 2009 }} Retrieved on February 8, 2007</ref><ref>[http://community.netscape.com/n/pfx/forum.aspx?tsn=1&nav=messages&webtag=ws-nscpbrowser&tid=6303 Netscape Community poll \u2013 Should Netscape continue to update 7.2?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090109100452/http://community.netscape.com/n/pfx/forum.aspx?tsn=1&nav=messages&webtag=ws-nscpbrowser&tid=6303 |date=January 9, 2009 }} Retrieved on February 8, 2007</ref><ref>[http://www.mozillazine.org/talkback.html?article=20397 Mozillazine \u2013 Netscape 9 announced] Retrieved on February 8, 2007</ref> This was not to be.\n\n===Mozilla Firefox-based releases===\n\n====Netscape Browser (version 8.0\u20138.1.3)====\nBetween 2005 and 2007, Netscape's releases became known as ''Netscape Browser''. AOL chose to base Netscape Browser on the relatively successful [[Mozilla Firefox]], a re-written version of Mozilla produced by the Mozilla Foundation. This release is not a full Internet suite as before, but is solely a web browser.\n\nOther controversial decisions include the browser only being released for [[Microsoft Windows]] and featuring both the [[Gecko (layout engine)|Gecko]] [[Web browser engine|rendering engine]] of previous releases and the [[Trident (layout engine)|Trident]] engine used in Internet Explorer, and switching between them based on a \"compatibility list\" that came with the browser. This effectively exposed users to the security vulnerabilities in both and resulted in a completely different user experience based on which site they were on. Examples are handling of right-to-left or bi-directional text, user interface widgets, bugs and web standards violations in Trident, etc. On top of this, Netscape Browser 8 even broke Internet Explorer's ability to open XML files by damaging a [[Windows Registry]] key, and would do so every time it was opened, even if the user fixed it manually.<ref>https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/ie/2005/05/25/netscape-8-and-internet-explorers-xml-rendering/</ref>\n\nAOL's acquisition of Netscape Communications in November

As of January 2012, no new posts have been made on either of these blogs since August 2008.\n\n===Netscape technologies===\nNetscape created the [[JavaScript]] web page scripting language. It also pioneered the development of [[push technology]], which effectively allowed websites to send regular updates of information (weather, stock updates, package tracking, etc.) directly to a user's desktop (aka \"webtop\"); Netscape's implementation of this was named Netcaster.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} However, businesses quickly recognized the use of push technology to deliver ads to users that annoyed them, so Netcaster was short-lived.\n\nNetscape was notable for its [[cross-platform]] efforts. Its client software continued to be made available for Windows ([[Windows 3.1x|3.1]], [[Windows 95|95]], [[Windows 98|98]], [[Windows NT|NT]]), Macintosh, Linux, [[OS/2]], [[BeOS]], and many versions of Unix including [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]], [[Solaris (operating system)|Sun Solaris]], [[Berkeley Software Design|BSDI]], [[IRIX]], [[IBM AIX]], and [[HP-UX]]. Its server software generally was only available for Unix and Windows NT, though some of its servers were made available on Linux, and a version of Netscape FastTrack Server was made available for Windows 95/98. Today, most of Netscape's server offerings live on as the [[Sun Java System]], formerly under the [[Sun ONE]] branding.

Two continuations of the original Netscape.com portal are available; Compuserve.com, the Web site of [[Compuserve]], and ISP.Netscape.com, the website for Netscape's dial-up discount ISP service, continue to use the Netscape.com layout as it was before June 2006. Of the two, only the latter explicitly uses the Netscape branding.\n\nNetscape.com is currently an AOL Netscape-branded mirror duplicate of the AOL.com portal with the [[URL]], replacing the former social news website in September 2007. The social news site moved to the Propeller.com domain, where it stayed until ending operations in October 2010. It features facilities such as news, sports, horoscopes, dating, movies, music and more. The change has come to much criticism amongst many site users, because the site has effectively become an AOL clone, and simply re-directs to regional AOL portals in some areas across the globe. Netscape's exclusive features, such as the Netscape Blog, Netscape NewsQuake, Netscape Navigator, My Netscape and Netscape Community pages, are less accessible from the AOL Netscape designed portal and in some countries not accessible at all without providing a full URL or completing an [[Internet search]].<ref>[http://community.netscape.com/n/pfx/forum.aspx?webtag=ws-nscpbrowser&nav=messages&tid=9781&tsn= Netscape Community responses] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071015195056/http://community.netscape.com/n/pfx/forum.aspx?webtag=ws-nscpbrowser&nav=messages&tid=9781&tsn= |date=October 15, 2007 }}.

The screenplay was written by [[Howard Barker]]. As acknowledged in the opening credits, the film is based on the 1928 play ''[[Journey's End]]'' by [[R. C. Sherriff]] with additional material from the memoir ''Sagittarius Rising'' by [[Cecil Arthur Lewis|Cecil Lewis]].\n\n''Aces High'' moves the action from the army in the trenches portrayed in ''Journey's End'' to the [[Royal Flying Corps]] (RFC). The film depicts an RFC squadron in the [[World War I|First World War]] during one week of battle, where the high death rate of pilots puts an enormous strain on those remaining.
