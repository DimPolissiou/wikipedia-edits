{"title_page": "British subject", "text_new": "{{EngvarB|date=November 2017}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2017}}\n{{British subjects}}\n{{Short description|Legal term that has evolved over time}}\n\nA '''British subject''' is a member of a class of [[British nationality law|British nationality]] largely granted under limited circumstances to people connected with [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] or [[British Raj|British India]] born before 1949. The term itself has historically had several different meanings, but is currently used to refer to a nationality class which was created to accommodate individuals who held a status previously called ''British subject without citizenship''. Individuals with this nationality are [[British national]]s and [[Commonwealth citizen]]s, but not [[British nationality law|British citizen]]s.\n\nThe status does not automatically grant the holder [[right of abode]] in the [[United Kingdom]] but most British subjects do have this entitlement. About 32,400 British subjects hold active [[British passport]]s with this status and enjoy consular protection when travelling abroad; fewer than 800 do not have right of abode in the UK.<ref>{{harvnb|FOI Letter on Passports}}.</ref>\n\nNationals of this class without right of abode are subject to immigration controls when entering the UK. British subjects without right of abode in the UK who hold no other nationality are effectively [[statelessness|stateless]] as they are not guaranteed the right to enter the country in which they are nationals.\n\n{{TOC limit}}\n\n== Background ==\n\n=== Overview ===\nDuring the development of the British Empire, travel and settlement rights were granted to subjects in Britain's overseas colonies which allowed them to travel and settle in Britain unhindered, in the same way that, for instance, a Scottish person could travel to London and settle there. Into the 1960s, British subjects' travel documents also allowed them to bring related minors, such as siblings or children, into the UK with them.<ref>Gentleman, Amelia. ''The Windrush Betrayal: Exposing the Hostile Environment.'' Guardian Faber Publishing, 2019. Ebook edition. loc. 864, 942, 994, 3676.</ref> These British subjects thus entered the UK legally and settled there legally.\n\nHowever, as the Empire dissolved and the former colonies became independent and developed their own nationality and immigration laws, such rights were progressively revoked for British subjects living in those places. Natives of these former colonies who had settled in the UK were given various cutoff points by which to register and acquire British citizenship. People who missed these cutoff points, despite having emigrated to the UK legally, or having been born and raised in the UK, were reclassified as illegal immigrants. Many were not aware of the cutoff points, believing themselves and their children to have always been British citizens.<ref>Gentleman, ''The Windrush Betrayal'', loc. 737, 968.</ref> Given the lack of identity documents in daily life in Britain, some of these people were not at all aware of their need for registration, or the difficulties involved, until quite late in life, when their old colonial travel documents could no longer be found.<ref> Gentleman, ''The Windrush Betrayal'', loc. 1021, 1112, 1301.</ref> The gradual reclassification of the status of British subjects and their progressive loss of rights thus created a new category of illegal immigrants, often entirely unaware of being such.\n\n=== Development from feudal allegiance ===\n{{See also|History of British nationality law#Early English and British nationality law|History of citizenship#Great Britain}}\n\nBefore the concept of nationality was codified in legislation, inhabitants of English communities owed [[allegiance]] to their [[Feudalism in England|feudal lords]], who were themselves [[vassal]]s of the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|monarch]]. This system of loyalty, indirectly owed to the monarch personally, developed into a general establishment of subjecthood to [[the Crown]].<ref name=\"HistoricalBackgroundP5\">{{harvnb|Historical background information on nationality|p=5}}.</ref> ''[[Calvin's Case]]'' in 1608 established the principle of ''[[jus soli]]'', that all those who were born within Crown dominions and allegiance were natural-born subjects.<ref>{{harvnb|Price|1997|pp=77\u201378}}.</ref> After the [[Acts of Union 1707]], English and Scottish subjects became British subjects.<ref name=\"HistoricalBackgroundP5\" /><ref name=\"Canavan116\">{{harvnb|''Re Canavan'' [2017] HCA 45}}, at para. 116</ref> Natural-born subjects were considered to owe perpetual allegiance to the Crown,<ref name=\"Blackstone1765\">{{harvnb|Blackstone|1765}}.</ref> and could not voluntarily renounce British subject status until it was first permitted in 1870.<ref>{{harvnb|Historical background information on nationality|pp=8\u20139}}.</ref>\n\nPrior to 1708, foreigners could only be [[naturalization|naturalised]] through [[Act of Parliament (UK)|Acts of Parliament]]. Although procedures were created after this point for [[Alien (law)|aliens]] to become subjects, personalised naturalising legislation continued to be enacted until 1975. Additionally, the monarch could personally make any foreigner a subject by [[royal prerogative]].<ref name=\"HistoricalBackgroundP8\">{{harvnb|Historical background information on nationality|p=8}}.</ref> A [[denization|denizen]] created by this method was not an alien but could not pass subject status to children by descent and was barred from Crown service and public office.<ref name=\"Blackstone1765\" /> This mechanism was never used after 1873.<ref>{{harvnb|Historical background information on nationality|p=9}}.</ref>\n\nA distinction was made between subjects who naturalised in the United Kingdom and those who did so in other territories. Individuals who naturalised in the UK were deemed to have received the status by ''imperial naturalisation'' that was valid throughout the Empire, while those in colonies were said to have gone through ''local naturalisation'' and given subject status valid only within the relevant territory.<ref name=\"HistoricalBackgroundP8\" />\n\nBritish subject status was codified in statute law for the first time by the [[History of British nationality law#British Nationality and Status of Aliens Act 1914|British Nationality and Status of Aliens Act 1914]], which formalised the status as a common nationality among the United Kingdom and its [[Dominion]]s. Dominions that adopted this Act as part of their own nationality laws ([[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[Irish Free State|Ireland]], [[Dominion of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]], [[Dominion of New Zealand|New Zealand]], and [[Union of South Africa|South Africa]]) were authorised to grant subject status to aliens by ''imperial naturalisation''.<ref>{{harvnb|Historical background information on nationality|p=10}}.</ref>\n\nDuring this time, British subject status was the principal form of British nationality.<ref name=\"Canavan116\" /> There were certain territories that came under British jurisdiction but were not formally incorporated as Crown territory proper. These included [[protectorate]]s, protected states, [[League of Nations mandate]]s, and [[United Nations trust territory|United Nations trust territories]]. Because they were foreign lands, birth in one of these areas did not automatically confer British subject status. Instead, most people associated with these territories were designated as [[British protected person]]s.<ref name=\"ProtectoratesAndProtectedStates\">{{cite web |title=Protectorates and Protected States |url=https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/258238/pandpstates.pdf |access-date=1 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Transition to Commonwealth citizenship ===\n{{See also|British Nationality Act 1948|Commonwealth citizen}}\n\nFollowing the [[World War I|First World War]], the Dominions developed distinct national identities. Britain formally recognised this at the [[1926 Imperial Conference]], jointly issuing the [[Balfour Declaration of 1926|Balfour Declaration]] with all the Dominion heads of government, which stated that the United Kingdom and Dominions were autonomous and equal to each other within the [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth of Nations]]. Legislative independence of the Dominions was given legal effect after passage and ratification of the [[Statute of Westminster 1931]].<ref>{{harvnb|Karatani|2003|pp=86\u201388}}.</ref> Diverging developments in Dominion nationality laws and ever growing assertions of independence from London culminated with the [[Canadian Citizenship Act 1946|creation of Canadian citizenship in 1946]].<ref>{{harvnb|Karatani|2003|pp=114\u2013115}}.</ref> Combined with the approaching independence of [[Dominion of India|India]] and [[Dominion of Pakistan|Pakistan]] in 1947, nationality law reform was necessary at this point to address ideas that were incompatible with the previous system.<ref>{{harvnb|Karatani|2003|pp=122\u2013126}}.</ref>\n\nThe [[British Nationality Act 1948]] redefined ''British subject'' as any citizen of the United Kingdom, its colonies, or other Commonwealth countries. ''Commonwealth citizen'' was first defined in this Act to have the same meaning.<ref>{{harvnb|British Nationality Act 1948}}.</ref> This alternate term was necessary to retain a number of newly independent countries in the Commonwealth that wished to become republics rather than preserve the monarch as head of state.<ref>{{harvnb|Weis|1979|p=17}}.</ref> The change in naming also indicated a shift in the base theory to this aspect of British nationality; allegiance to the Crown was no longer a requirement to possess British subject status and the common status would be maintained by voluntary agreement among the various members of the Commonwealth.<ref>{{harvnb|Karatani|2003|pp=116\u2013118}}.</ref>\n\nBritish subject/Commonwealth citizen status coexisted with the citizenships of each Commonwealth country. A person born in Australia would be both an Australian citizen and a British subject.<ref name=\"EUIAust\">{{cite web |last=Thwaites |first=Rayner |year=2017 |title=Report on Citizenship Law: Australia |publisher=[[European University Institute]] |page=2 |url=http://cadmus.eui.eu/bitstream/handle/1814/46449/RSCAS_GLOBALCIT_CR_2017_11.pdf |access-date=3 April 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190404005007/http://cadmus.eui.eu/bitstream/handle/1814/46449/RSCAS_GLOBALCIT_CR_2017_11.pdf |archive-date=4 April 2019 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> British subjects under the previous meaning who held that status on 1 January 1949 because of a connection with the United Kingdom or a remaining colony became ''Citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies (CUKC)''. This was the principal form of British nationality during this period of time.<ref>{{harvnb|''Re Canavan'' [2017] HCA 45}}, at para. 101</ref>\n\nThere was also a category of people called ''British subjects without citizenship''. Irish citizens who fulfilled certain requirements could file formal claims with the [[Home Secretary]] to remain British subjects under this definition. Additionally, those who did not qualify for CUKC status or citizenship in other Commonwealth countries, or were connected with a country that had not yet defined citizenship laws, would transitionally remain British subjects in this group.<ref>{{harvnb|Weis|1979|p=18}}.</ref>\n\nAll British subjects initially held an automatic right to settle in the United Kingdom,<ref>{{harvnb|McKay|2008}}.</ref> though non-white immigration into the United Kingdom was systemically discouraged.<ref>{{harvnb|Hansen|1999|p=90}}.</ref> This entitlement was part of a wider initiative to preserve close relationships with certain Dominions and colonies (Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, and [[Southern Rhodesia]]) and to moderate nationalist attitudes within the Commonwealth.<ref>{{harvnb|Hansen|1999|pp=76\u201377}}.</ref> It was thought that only a limited number of non-white colonial migrants would ever seek to settle in the UK.<ref>{{harvnb|Hansen|1999|pp=87\u201389}}.</ref> However, strong economic conditions in Britain after the [[World War II|Second World War]] attracted an unprecedented wave of colonial migration. In response to growing anti-immigration sentiment,<ref>{{harvnb|Hansen|1999|pp=94\u201395}}.</ref> Parliament imposed immigration controls on subjects originating from outside the [[British Islands]] with the [[Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1962]].<ref>{{harvnb|Evans|1972|p=508}}.</ref> The [[Immigration Act 1971]] relaxed controls on patrials, subjects whose parents or grandparents were born in the United Kingdom,<ref>{{harvnb|Evans|1972|p=509}}.</ref> and gave effective preferential treatment to Commonwealth citizens from white-majority countries.<ref>{{harvnb|Paul|1997|p=181}}.</ref>\n\nOutside of the United Kingdom, the legal significance of British subject status varied depending on each Commonwealth country's legislation. At first, British subjects retained in some of these countries eligibility to vote in elections, for preferred paths to citizenship, and for welfare benefits. These privileges were removed on independence in most countries but still retained in some. British subjects were eligible to vote in New Zealand until 1975,<ref>{{harvnb|McMillan|2017|p=31}}.</ref> Canada on the federal level until 1975 (not fully phased out in provinces until 2006),<ref>{{cite report |last=Maas |first=Willem |title=Access to electoral rights: Canada |publisher=[[European University Institute]] |date=July 2015 |pp=13\u201314 |url=https://www.yorku.ca/maas/Maas2015b.pdf |access-date=5 April 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180728190054/http://www.yorku.ca/maas/Maas2015b.pdf |archivedate=28 July 2018 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> and Australia until 1984 (though subjects on the electoral roll in that year are still eligible).<ref>{{harvnb|Chappell|Chesterman|Hill|2009|p=98}}.</ref>\n\nBecause each country now defined ''British subject'' in separate pieces of legislation and these definitions were not always updated or kept at parity, individuals could have been British subjects in one country at a given time but not another. For example, a South African citizen in 1967 would have been considered a British subject in Canada, but not the United Kingdom or South Africa. The country was included in the list of Commonwealth nations in Canadian law,<ref>{{harvnb|Banks|1967|pp=190\u2013191}}.</ref> despite South Africa having left the Commonwealth in 1961 and not rejoining it until 1994.<ref>{{harvnb|Turner|2008|p=45}}.</ref>\n\n=== Redefinition as residual nationality class ===\n{{See also|British Nationality Act 1981}}\n\nBy the 1980s, most colonies of the British Empire had become independent. Parliament updated nationality law to reflect the more modest geographical boundaries of the United Kingdom.<ref>{{harvnb|Paul|1997|pp=182\u2013183}}.</ref> The [[British Nationality Act 1981]] recategorised CUKCs into different nationality groups based on patriality and birthplace. CUKCs with the right of abode in the United Kingdom or were closely connected with the UK, [[Channel Islands]], or [[Isle of Man]] became British citizens while those connected with a remaining colony became [[British Overseas Territories citizen|British Dependent Territories citizens]]. Those who could not be reclassified into either of these statuses and were no longer associated with a British territory became [[British Overseas citizen]]s.<ref name=\"BNA1981\">{{harvnb|British Nationality Act 1981}}.</ref>\n\nWhile all nationals under those categories continue to be Commonwealth citizens, the definition of ''British subject'' was limited to its present meaning. It currently only includes the category of people previously called ''British subjects without citizenship'' as well as women who married such persons and registered for the status.

The term itself has historically had several different meanings, but is currently used to refer to a nationality class which was created to accommodate individuals who held a status previously called ''British subject without citizenship''. Individuals with this nationality are [[British national]]s and [[Commonwealth citizen]]s, but not [[British nationality law|British citizen]]s.\n\nThe status does not automatically grant the holder [[right of abode]] in the [[United Kingdom]] but most British subjects do have this entitlement. About 32,400 British subjects hold active [[British passport]]s with this status and enjoy consular protection when travelling abroad; fewer than 800 do not have right of abode in the UK.<ref>{{harvnb|FOI Letter on Passports}}.</ref>\n\nNationals of this class without right of abode are subject to immigration controls when entering the UK. British subjects without right of abode in the UK who hold no other nationality are effectively [[statelessness|stateless]] as they are not guaranteed the right to enter the country in which they are nationals.\n\n{{TOC limit}}\n\n== Background ==\n\n=== Overview ===\nDuring the development of the British Empire, travel and settlement rights were granted to subjects in Britain's overseas colonies which allowed them to travel and settle in Britain unhindered, in the same way that, for instance, a Scottish person could travel to London and settle there. Into the 1960s, British subjects' travel documents also allowed them to bring related minors, such as siblings or children, into the UK with them.<ref>Gentleman, Amelia. ''The Windrush Betrayal: Exposing the Hostile Environment.'' Guardian Faber Publishing, 2019. Ebook edition. loc. 864, 942, 994, 3676.</ref> These British subjects thus entered the UK legally and settled there legally.\n\nHowever, as the Empire dissolved and the former colonies became independent and developed their own nationality and immigration laws, such rights were progressively revoked for British subjects living in those places. Natives of these former colonies who had settled in the UK were given various cutoff points by which to register and acquire British citizenship. People who missed these cutoff points, despite having emigrated to the UK legally, or having been born and raised in the UK, were reclassified as illegal immigrants. Many were not aware of the cutoff points, believing themselves and their children to have always been British citizens.<ref>Gentleman, ''The Windrush Betrayal'', loc. 737, 968.</ref> Given the lack of identity documents in daily life in Britain, some of these people were not at all aware of their need for registration, or the difficulties involved, until quite late in life, when their old colonial travel documents could no longer be found.<ref> Gentleman, ''The Windrush Betrayal'', loc. 1021, 1112, 1301.</ref> The gradual reclassification of the status of British subjects and their progressive loss of rights thus created a new category of illegal immigrants, often entirely unaware of being such.\n\n=== Development from feudal allegiance ===\n{{See also|History of British nationality law#Early English and British nationality law|History of citizenship#Great Britain}}\n\nBefore the concept of nationality was codified in legislation, inhabitants of English communities owed [[allegiance]] to their [[Feudalism in England|feudal lords]], who were themselves [[vassal]]s of the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|monarch]]. This system of loyalty, indirectly owed to the monarch personally, developed into a general establishment of subjecthood to [[the Crown]].<ref name=\"HistoricalBackgroundP5\">{{harvnb|Historical background information on nationality|p=5}}.</ref> ''[[Calvin's Case]]'' in 1608 established the principle of ''[[jus soli]]'', that all those who were born within Crown dominions and allegiance were natural-born subjects.<ref>{{harvnb|Price|1997|pp=77\u201378}}.</ref> After the [[Acts of Union 1707]], English and Scottish subjects became British subjects.<ref name=\"HistoricalBackgroundP5\" /><ref name=\"Canavan116\">{{harvnb|''Re Canavan'' [2017] HCA 45}}, at para. 116</ref> Natural-born subjects were considered to owe perpetual allegiance to the Crown,<ref name=\"Blackstone1765\">{{harvnb|Blackstone|1765}}.</ref> and could not voluntarily renounce British subject status until it was first permitted in 1870.<ref>{{harvnb|Historical background information on nationality|pp=8\u20139}}.</ref>\n\nPrior to 1708, foreigners could only be [[naturalization|naturalised]] through [[Act of Parliament (UK)|Acts of Parliament]]. Although procedures were created after this point for [[Alien (law)|aliens]] to become subjects, personalised naturalising legislation continued to be enacted until 1975. Additionally, the monarch could personally make any foreigner a subject by [[royal prerogative]].<ref name=\"HistoricalBackgroundP8\">{{harvnb|Historical background information on nationality|p=8}}.</ref> A [[denization|denizen]] created by this method was not an alien but could not pass subject status to children by descent and was barred from Crown service and public office.<ref name=\"Blackstone1765\" /> This mechanism was never used after 1873.<ref>{{harvnb|Historical background information on nationality|p=9}}.</ref>\n\nA distinction was made between subjects who naturalised in the United Kingdom and those who did so in other territories. Individuals who naturalised in the UK were deemed to have received the status by ''imperial naturalisation'' that was valid throughout the Empire, while those in colonies were said to have gone through ''local naturalisation'' and given subject status valid only within the relevant territory.<ref name=\"HistoricalBackgroundP8\" />\n\nBritish subject status was codified in statute law for the first time by the [[History of British nationality law#British Nationality and Status of Aliens Act 1914|British Nationality and Status of Aliens Act 1914]], which formalised the status as a common nationality among the United Kingdom and its [[Dominion]]s. Dominions that adopted this Act as part of their own nationality laws ([[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[Irish Free State|Ireland]], [[Dominion of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]], [[Dominion of New Zealand|New Zealand]], and [[Union of South Africa|South Africa]]) were authorised to grant subject status to aliens by ''imperial naturalisation''.<ref>{{harvnb|Historical background information on nationality|p=10}}.</ref>\n\nDuring this time, British subject status was the principal form of British nationality.<ref name=\"Canavan116\" /> There were certain territories that came under British jurisdiction but were not formally incorporated as Crown territory proper. These included [[protectorate]]s, protected states, [[League of Nations mandate]]s, and [[United Nations trust territory|United Nations trust territories]].

For example, a South African citizen in 1967 would have been considered a British subject in Canada, but not the United Kingdom or South Africa. The country was included in the list of Commonwealth nations in Canadian law,<ref>{{harvnb|Banks|1967|pp=190\u2013191}}.</ref> despite South Africa having left the Commonwealth in 1961 and not rejoining it until 1994.<ref>{{harvnb|Turner|2008|p=45}}.</ref>\n\n=== Redefinition as residual nationality class ===\n{{See also|British Nationality Act 1981}}\n\nBy the 1980s, most colonies of the British Empire had become independent.

He remained her youngest minister for four years.\n\nIn 1983, Mellor was appointed to the Home Office<ref>Daily Telegraph, 10 June</ref> where he was involved in several pieces of ground-breaking \"Law and Order\" legislation, including the pioneering [[Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984]],<ref>[[Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984]]</ref> which amongst other things required police to tape-record all interviews with suspects in order for such evidence to be admissible at trial; The [[Prosecution of Offenders Act 1985]] establishing the [[Crown Prosecution Service]]; legislation enabling the re-investigation of Miscarriages of Justice; and the significant vivisection \"laboratory testing of animals\" welfare legislation the [[Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986]].\n\nThe last Act, prepared by a coalition of animal welfarists and scientists led by [[Andrew Huxley|Sir Andrew Huxley]] (President of the Royal Society), and was jointly launched by them, Mellor, and campaigner [[Michael Balls|Dr Michael Balls]] \u2013 Father of Ed Balls MP (who went on to become the Labour Party's shadow [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]]) \u2013 gave the UK what is still the most advanced framework for the protection of laboratory animals.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\nIn 1987, Mellor was promoted to the [[Foreign Office]] by [[Margaret Thatcher]], and was made responsible for the Middle East, Eastern Europe, and the Soviet Union (before [[revolutions of 1989|the fall of the Iron Curtain]]). In January 1988 during an official visit to [[Israel]] he protested angrily in front of press and TV cameras to an Israeli army colonel about what he saw as the \"excessive\" and brutal way troops were treating local [[Palestinians]]. Mellor's furious demand that it be stopped, and later statement to journalists that the treatment was \"an affront to civilised values\" was broadcast around the world, and caused an international incident for which Mellor refused point blank to apologise. He was later privately [[reprimand]]ed by Thatcher.\n\nHe was briefly [[Minister for Health]] in 1988, where he was responsible for health service reforms, before he was made a [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Councillor]] in 1990 by [[Margaret Thatcher]], shortly before she resigned as Prime Minister.\n\nMellor was briefly [[Minister for the Arts|Arts Minister]] in 1990 before entering [[John Major]]'s new Cabinet as [[Chief Secretary to the Treasury]] in November 1990. He was interviewed in December 1991 on the TV programmne ''Hard News'' following the establishment of the [[Press Complaints Commission|Calcutt Review]] inquiring into Press Standards. Mellor claimed during the interview that \"the press \u2013 the popular press \u2013 is drinking in the Last Chance Saloon\"<ref>quoted in Roy Greenslade Press Gang: How Newspapers Make Profits From Propaganda, London: Macmillan, 2003 [2004], p.539, n.21, p739; Hard News, Channel 4, 21 December 1989, The Times, 22 December 1989, p.5</ref> and called for curbs on the \"sacred cow\" of press freedom.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sirc.org/articles/last_chance_saloon.html |title=Closing time at the Last-Chance Saloon |publisher=Sirc.org |accessdate=12 July 2014}}</ref> The press, coming under heavy criticism at that time, reacted furiously, alleging that he was prejudging Sir David Calcutt's inquiry.\n\nAfter the [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992 general election]] he remained a Cabinet Minister when he was made [[Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport|Secretary of State]] in the newly created [[Department for National Heritage]] (now the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport), during which period he was [[vernacular]]ly known as the \"Minister for Fun\" after comments he made to the waiting press on leaving 10 Downing Street on his appointment.\n\n===Resignation===\nRetaliation from the media for his \"last chance saloon\" comment came in July 1992, when Mellor's former mistress, actress [[Antonia de Sancha]], sold her [[wikt:kiss and tell|kiss and tell]] story of Mellor's [[Affair|extra-marital affair]] with her for \u00a335,000.

He remained her youngest minister for four years.\n\nIn 1983, Mellor was appointed to the Home Office<ref>Daily Telegraph, 10 June</ref> where he was involved in several pieces of ground-breaking \"Law and Order\" legislation, including the pioneering [[Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984]],<ref>[[Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984]]</ref> which amongst other things required police to tape-record all interviews with suspects in order for such evidence to be admissible at trial; The [[Prosecution of Offenders Act 1985]] establishing the [[Crown Prosecution Service]]; legislation enabling the re-investigation of Miscarriages of Justice; and the significant vivisection \"laboratory testing of animals\" welfare legislation the [[Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986]].\n\nThe last Act, prepared by a coalition of animal welfarists and scientists led by [[Andrew Huxley|Sir Andrew Huxley]] (President of the Royal Society), and was jointly launched by them, Mellor, and campaigner [[Michael Balls|Dr Michael Balls]] \u2013 Father of Ed Balls MP (who went on to become the Labour Party's shadow [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]]) \u2013 gave the UK what is still the most advanced framework for the protection of laboratory animals.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\nIn 1987, Mellor was promoted to the [[Foreign Office]] by [[Margaret Thatcher]], and was made responsible for the Middle East, Eastern Europe, and the Soviet Union (before [[revolutions of 1989|the fall of the Iron Curtain]]). In January 1988 during an official visit to [[Israel]] he protested angrily in front of press and TV cameras to an Israeli army colonel about what he saw as the \"excessive\" and brutal way troops were treating local [[Palestinians]].

The age requirement is 17\u201327 as of 2011, though the upper age was previously up to 25. While there has been other Miss Hong Kong pageants in prior years producing notable titleholders such as Judy Dann (1951), Virginia June Lee (1954), Michelle Mok (1958), Laura da Costa (1967) and Mabel Hawkett (1970), the current annual TVB pageant began in 1973. Apart from the top prize winner, first runner-up and second runner-up prizes, the pageant also has other consolation prizes that vary slightly from year to year. Many Miss Hong Kong contestants have gone on to have movie careers as it is quite typical for the top contestants to garner television contracts from TVB.\n*Overseas Recruitment: Applications are available in New York City, Los Angeles, San Francisco, any TVB rental store in the US, Fairchild TV station, Ontario, Richmond, British Columbia, and any TVB rental store in Canada. Delegates have to send in their applications before the deadline. TVB, organizers of the pageant travel to cities in the US and Canada. They include: Los Angeles, San Francisco, Toronto, and Vancouver. TVB would choose a certain amount of delegates to interview and would call them to interview. Besides personal interviews, delegates have to wear swimsuits chosen by themselves and walk around in it. Delegates are chosen and return to Hong Kong in late May to compete.\n* Local Recruitment: Hong Kong. Applications are available in Hong Kong, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, United Kingdom, and Europe. Delegates have to send in their applications before the deadline. Weeks later, primary and secondary interviews are conducted. Top interviewed finalists are chosen and they record a reality TV show (like 2006) to choose the deserving semifinalists to compete. They joined the overseas delegates to form the top event finalists.\n\nThe pageant is traditionally televised into two events, although this is not always necessarily the case in recent years. First, a preliminary event is held where 12 finalists are selected from a group of candidates, the number of which is usually around 20\u201325 (with 30 being the maximum). Then a final event is held, culminating in the announcement of the winner and the first and second runners-up from the 12 finalists. In some years, the field is narrowed down to a final 5, from which the runners-up and winner are chosen. Often several contestants dropped out of the pageant before the televised preliminary, thus there would be a candidate with #30 assigned to her, but only 25 or so contestants.\n\n== Summary of winners

Local contestants coming from [[Malaysia]], Australia, [[New Zealand]], London, and more enter at Hong Kong. In 2006, there was a top 16 contestant from the [[Netherlands]]. The overseas delegates wait for the notification of their regional sponsors of TVB and if they are chosen, they fly to Hong Kong to compete.

The age requirement is 17\u201327 as of 2011, though the upper age was previously up to 25. While there has been other Miss Hong Kong pageants in prior years producing notable titleholders such as Judy Dann (1951), Virginia June Lee (1954), Michelle Mok (1958), Laura da Costa (1967) and Mabel Hawkett (1970), the current annual TVB pageant began in 1973. Apart from the top prize winner, first runner-up and second runner-up prizes, the pageant also has other consolation prizes that vary slightly from year to year. Many Miss Hong Kong contestants have gone on to have movie careers as it is quite typical for the top contestants to garner television contracts from TVB.\n*Overseas Recruitment: Applications are available in New York City, Los Angeles, San Francisco, any TVB rental store in the US, Fairchild TV station, Ontario, Richmond, British Columbia, and any TVB rental store in Canada. Delegates have to send in their applications before the deadline. TVB, organizers of the pageant travel to cities in the US and Canada. They include: Los Angeles, San Francisco, Toronto, and Vancouver. TVB would choose a certain amount of delegates to interview and would call them to interview. Besides personal interviews, delegates have to wear swimsuits chosen by themselves and walk around in it. Delegates are chosen and return to Hong Kong in late May to compete.\n* Local Recruitment: Hong Kong. Applications are available in Hong Kong, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, United Kingdom, and Europe. Delegates have to send in their applications before the deadline. Weeks later, primary and secondary interviews are conducted. Top interviewed finalists are chosen and they record a reality TV show (like 2006) to choose the deserving semifinalists to compete. They joined the overseas delegates to form the top event finalists.\n\nThe pageant is traditionally televised into two events, although this is not always necessarily the case in recent years. First, a preliminary event is held where 12 finalists are selected from a group of candidates, the number of which is usually around 20\u201325 (with 30 being the maximum). Then a final event is held, culminating in the announcement of the winner and the first and second runners-up from the 12 finalists. In some years, the field is narrowed down to a final 5, from which the runners-up and winner are chosen. Often several contestants dropped out of the pageant before the televised preliminary, thus there would be a candidate with #30 assigned to her, but only 25 or so contestants.\n\n== Summary of winners

Local contestants coming from [[Malaysia]], Australia, [[New Zealand]], London, and more enter at Hong Kong. In 2006, there was a top 16 contestant from the [[Netherlands]]. The overseas delegates wait for the notification of their regional sponsors of TVB and if they are chosen, they fly to Hong Kong to compete.

Even though the 2007 pageant had the top 3 all from the US and Canada but Grace Wong and Lorretta Chow travelled to Hong Kong to compete in the pageant, so they are recognised by TVB to be local delegates not overseas delegates.
