This claim stems from the fact that various German-speaking populations had previously arrived on the territory of contemporary Romania in different waves or stages of settlement, initially starting with the [[High Middle Ages]] (see also ''[[Ostsiedlung]]''), firstly to southern and northeastern [[Transylvania]] (some of them even crossing the outer [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathians]] to neighbouring [[Moldavia]] and [[Wallachia]]), then subsequently during the [[Modern history|Modern Age]] in other [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg]]-ruled lands (such as [[Duchy of Bukovina|Bukovina]], at the time part of [[Cisleithania]], or the [[Banat of Temeswar|Banat]]). Eventually, the [[Romanian Old Kingdom]] was also colonized by Germans, firstly in [[Dobruja]] and then gradually in Moldavia and Wallachia.\n\n[[Image:Deutschsieben b\u00fcrgen.svg|250px|right|thumb|Detailed map depicting the traditional settlement areas of the Romanian-Germans in [[Transylvania]] and [[Banat]], two historical regions situated in central, respectively southwestern present-day Romania.]]\n\nTherefore, given their rather complex geographic background, in order to understand their language, culture, customs, and history, the Germans of Romania must be regarded as the following independent sub-groups:\n\n* [[Transylvanian Saxons]] \u2013 the largest and eldest German community on the territory of modern-day Romania (often simply equated with all Romanian-Germans);\n* [[Transylvanian Landler]]s \u2013 expelled Protestants (Evangelical Lutherans) from the region of [[Salzkammergut]], contemporary [[Austria]] to southern Transylvania during the 18th century;\n* Most [[Banat Swabians]] as well as the entirety of the [[Satu Mare Swabians|Sathmar Swabians]]<ref name=\"Barcan\">Monica Barcan, Adalbert Millitz, ''The German Nationality in Romania'' (1978), page 42: \"The Satu Mare Swabians are true Swabians, their place of origin being [[W\u00fcrttemberg]], in the land of [[Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]].

The DFDR/FDGR also adheres to a pro-monarchic stance regarding the matter of monarchy restoration in Romania.\n\nUntil 1 January 2007 (i.e. the date of accession of Romania to the [[European Union]]), the DFDR/FDGR was also an observing member of the [[European Parliament]], briefly affiliated with the [[European People's Party group|European People's Party]] ({{lang-de|Europ\u00e4ische Volkspartei}}), between January and November of the same year.\n\n==Education==\n[[File:Liceul Samuel von Brukenthal.jpg|thumb|Samuel von Brukenthal National College in Sibiu ({{lang-de|Hermannstadt}})]]\n\nIn [[Bucharest]] there are two German-language schools, namely [[Deutsche Schule Bukarest]] and [[Deutsches Goethe-Kolleg Bukarest]].

This claim stems from the fact that various German-speaking populations had previously arrived on the territory of contemporary Romania in different waves or stages of settlement, initially starting with the [[High Middle Ages]] (see also ''[[Ostsiedlung]]''), firstly to southern and northeastern [[Transylvania]] (some of them even crossing the outer [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathians]] to neighbouring [[Moldavia]] and [[Wallachia]]), then subsequently during the [[Modern history|Modern Age]] in other [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg]]-ruled lands (such as [[Duchy of Bukovina|Bukovina]], at the time part of [[Cisleithania]], or the [[Banat of Temeswar|Banat]]).

The forum is a political platform that has a centrist ideology which aims to support the minority rights of the Germans from Romania.\n\nSince 1989, the DFDR/FDGR has competed both in [[Elections in Romania|local and legislative elections]], cooperating in the process with two historical parties of the [[Politics of Romania|Romanian politics]], namely the [[National Liberal Party (Romania)|National Liberal Party]] (PNL) and the [[Christian Democratic National Peasants' Party]] (PN\u021aCD), most notably at local administrative level, in cities such as Sibiu ({{lang-de|Hermannstadt}}), Timi\u0219oara ({{lang-de|Temeschburg}}), or [[Baia Mare]] ({{lang-de|Frauenbach}}). The DFDR/FDGR also adheres to a pro-monarchic stance regarding the matter of monarchy restoration in Romania.\n\nUntil 1 January 2007 (i.e. the date of accession of Romania to the [[European Union]]), the DFDR/FDGR was also an observing member of the [[European Parliament]], briefly affiliated with the [[European People's Party group|European People's Party]] ({{lang-de|Europ\u00e4ische Volkspartei}}), between January and November of the same year.\n\n==Education==\n[[File:Liceul Samuel von Brukenthal.jpg|thumb|Samuel von Brukenthal National College in Sibiu ({{lang-de|Hermannstadt}})]]\n\nIn [[Bucharest]] there are two German-language schools, namely [[Deutsche Schule Bukarest]] and [[Deutsches Goethe-Kolleg Bukarest]].

The following was addressed at the meeting:\n\n* The development of Africa should be for the benefit of Africans and not merely for the profits of Europeans.\n* There should be home rule and a responsible government for British West Africa and the [[British West Indies]].\n* The Abolition of the pretension of a white minority to dominate a black majority in Kenya, [[Rhodesia]] and South Africa.\n* [[Lynching]] and mob law in the US should be suppressed.\n\nBefore the Congress met in London, [[Isaac B\u00e9ton]] of the French Committee wrote a letter to Du Bois, telling him that the French group would not be sending delegates. However, in one of the reports he published in the ''[[Crisis]]'', Du Bois drew on words spoken by [[Ida Gibbs Hunt]] and [[Rayford Logan]] to imply that the French Committee had sent delegates.

Delegates included scholars, intellectuals and political activists who would later go on to become influential leaders in various [[African independence movements]] and [[Civil rights movement|American civil rights movements]]. The presence of 77-year-old [[W. E. B. Du Bois]] was historic, as he had organized the First Pan-African Congress in 1919.\n\nThis Congress is widely considered to have been the most important. Organised by the influential [[Trinidad]]ian pan-Africanist [[George Padmore]] and Ghanaian independence leader [[Kwame Nkrumah]], it was attended by 90 delegates, 26 from Africa. They included many scholars, intellectuals and political activists who would later go on to become influential leaders in various African independence movements and the American civil rights movement, including the [[Kenya]]n independence leader [[Jomo Kenyatta]], American activist and academic [[W.

It demands that the riches of the continent be used for the enlistment of its people. It calls for the financial and economic unification of markets and a new political landscape for the continent. Even though Pan-Africanism as a movement began in 1776, it was the fifth Pan-African congress that advanced Pan-Africanism and applied it to decolonize the African continent.<ref>{{cite web | title=Road to Pan-Africanism|first=Motsoko |last=Pheko| work=The Sowetan| date=15 November 1999 | url=http://www.panafricanperspective.com/pheko.htm}}</ref>\n\nThe people in Manchester were politically conscious and that was one of the reasons why it was selected as the venue for the fifth Pan-African congress. The fifth congress was organized by people of African origin living in Manchester. According to the Mancunian historian Simon Katzenellenboggen it has a great significance as it was an important step towards the end of those imperial powers in Africa. Unlike the four earlier congresses, the fifth one involved people from the African Diaspora, including Afro-Caribbeans and Afro-Americans. Manchester had a significant part to play in helping the African countries to march forward in their fight to independence.<ref>{{cite web |title=It began in Manchester \u2014 Manchester and The Pan-African Movement |publisher=BBC News; Black History Month |date=14 October 2005| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/manchester/content/articles/2005/10/14/151005_pan_african_congress_feature.shtml}}\n</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[First Pan-African Conference]]\n* [[Pan-Africanism]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Pan-African Congress}}\n* [https://snccdigital.org/our-voices/internationalism/part-4/ SNCC Digital Gateway: Organizing 6PAC] Digital documentary website created by the SNCC Legacy Project and Duke University, telling the story of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee & grassroots organizing from the inside-out\n* [http://lucas.leeds.ac.uk/article/remembering-the-fifth-pan-african-congress-christian-hogsbjerg/ \"Remembering the Fifth Pan-African Congress - Christian H\u00f8gsbjerg], ''[[Leeds African Studies Bulletin]]'', 77 (2015\u201316). \n* B.

This meeting was totally unorganized. This meeting also repeated the demands such as self-rule, the problems in the [[African diaspora|Diaspora]] and the African-European relationship. The following was addressed at the meeting:\n\n* The development of Africa should be for the benefit of Africans and not merely for the profits of Europeans.\n* There should be home rule and a responsible government for British West Africa and the [[British West Indies]].\n* The Abolition of the pretension of a white minority to dominate a black majority in Kenya, [[Rhodesia]] and South Africa.\n* [[Lynching]] and mob law in the US should be suppressed.\n\nBefore the Congress met in London, [[Isaac B\u00e9ton]] of the French Committee wrote a letter to Du Bois, telling him that the French group would not be sending delegates. However, in one of the reports he published in the ''[[Crisis]]'', Du Bois drew on words spoken by [[Ida Gibbs Hunt]] and [[Rayford Logan]] to imply that the French Committee had sent delegates. As long-time African-American residents of France, Hunt and Logan had travelled independently to the meeting, and Hunt and B\u00e9ton were perturbed that Du Bois had implied they represented France.<ref>{{cite book|last=Roberts|first=Brian Russell|title=Artistic Ambassadors: Literary and International Representation of the New Negro Era|year=2013|publisher=University of Virginia Press|location=Charlottesville|pages=125\u2013126}}</ref>\n\n== 4th Pan-African Congress ==\nIn 1927, The Fourth Pan-African Congress was held in [[New York City]] and adopted resolutions that were similar to the Third Pan-African Congress meetings.<ref>{{cite web | title=The Pan-African Vision | work=The Story of Africa: Between World Wars (1914\u20131945) | publisher=BBC News | accessdate=16 April 2008| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/africa/features/storyofafrica/13chapter5.shtml }}</ref>\n\n== 5th Pan-African Congress ==\n\n[[File:Manchester-fifth-pan-african-conference-1.jpg|thumb|The commemorating plaque in [[Manchester]]]]\n\nThe Fifth Pan-African Congress was held in [[Manchester]], United Kingdom, from 15th\u201321st October 1945.

There were also a few South Asian delegates in attendance. Delegates included scholars, intellectuals and political activists who would later go on to become influential leaders in various African independence movements and American civil rights movements.

It also  led partially to the creation of the [[Pan-African Federation]], founded in 1946 by Nkrumah and Kenyatta.\n\nThere were 33 delegates from the West Indies and 35 from various British organizations, including the [[West African Students Union]]. The presence of 77-year-old Du Bois was historic, as he had organized the First Pan-African Congress in 1919.\n\nThe British Press scarcely mentioned the conference.

It demands that the riches of the continent be used for the enlistment of its people. It calls for the financial and economic unification of markets and a new political landscape for the continent. Even though Pan-Africanism as a movement began in 1776, it was the fifth Pan-African congress that advanced Pan-Africanism and applied it to decolonize the African continent.<ref>{{cite web | title=Road to Pan-Africanism|first=Motsoko |last=Pheko| work=The Sowetan| date=15 November 1999 | url=http://www.panafricanperspective.com/pheko.htm}}</ref>\n\nThe people in Manchester were politically conscious and that was one of the reasons why it was selected as the venue for the fifth Pan-African congress. The fifth congress was organized by people of African origin living in Manchester. According to the Mancunian historian Simon Katzenellenboggen it has a great significance as it was an important step towards the end of those imperial powers in Africa. Unlike the four earlier congresses, the fifth one involved people from the African Diaspora, including Afro-Caribbeans and Afro-Americans. Manchester had a significant part to play in helping the African countries to march forward in their fight to independence.<ref>{{cite web |title=It began in Manchester \u2014 Manchester and The Pan-African Movement |publisher=BBC News; Black History Month |date=14 October 2005| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/manchester/content/articles/2005/10/14/151005_pan_african_congress_feature.shtml}}\n</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[First Pan-African Conference]]\n* [[Pan-Africanism]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Pan-African Congress}}\n* [https://snccdigital.org/our-voices/internationalism/part-4/ SNCC Digital Gateway: Organizing 6PAC] Digital documentary website created by the SNCC Legacy Project and Duke University, telling the story of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee & grassroots organizing from the inside-out\n* [http://lucas.leeds.ac.uk/article/remembering-the-fifth-pan-african-congress-christian-hogsbjerg/ \"Remembering the Fifth Pan-African Congress - Christian H\u00f8gsbjerg], ''[[Leeds African Studies Bulletin]]'', 77 (2015\u201316). \n* B.
