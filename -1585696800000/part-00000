While observing an exercise designed to evaluate Delta candidates, Scott meets a recruit, Curtis, as well as Sergeant Jacqueline Black, a knife fighting instructor.\n\nScott is drawn into a clandestine operation to find Laura Newton, the [[President of the United States|President]]'s daughter, who is missing. He and Curtis go first to the beach house of one of Laura's professors, with whom she is said to have a relationship. They find neither person there but find two unidentified men who react aggressively, leading Curtis, who has taken up position outside with a sniper's rifle, to shoot the men. Another lead takes them to a bar where girls are recruited as prostitutes, and Scott's team follows a middleman from the bar to a brothel that funnels some of these girls to an international sex slavery ring. The madam gives them a contact number leading to a pay phone.\n\nCalls placed to the pay phone are traced to Tariq Asani, a Lebanese national currently in federal prison. They plan to intercept Asani during a prisoner transport for medical treatment and gain information from him about the sex trafficking operation.\n\nWhen the car carrying Asani and another prisoner stops en route to its destination, Scott shows up and appears to kill the transport guard, then kills the other prisoner who was on death row. He spares Asani when Asani says he can get them on a plane out of the country that night and confirms the sex slavery ring is based in [[Dubai]].\n\nScott stops at a convenience store to relay the information to the team. Curtis provides him with more ammunition, but Asani, waiting in the car, happens to spot the badge of another agent talking with Curtis and opens fire. Curtis is wounded and Scott has to kill Asani.\n\nAs the team prepares an assault in Dubai, a news broadcast reports that Laura and her college professor were discovered drowned while sailing off the coast of [[Martha's Vineyard]]. The rescue operation is called off. Scott returns home, convinced there is no more to be done, but Curtis tracks him down and insists that Laura is alive. He shows Scott an earring that was caught in his sniper's mat from the beach house identical to the earrings Laura is wearing in a news photograph.\n\nWhen they return to the beach house to investigate, Curtis is killed by a sniper positioned on a nearby boat. Scott evades the sniper and when he finds Laura's unique sign on a window in the beach house indicating she was there, he realizes that she may not be dead. He takes his pager and phone apart and finds a tracking device.\n\nHe tries to contact Laura's mother, who is visiting a rehab facility, but he is intercepted by a female [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] agent assigned to guard the [[First Family of the United States|First Family]]. When he shows the agent the earring, the agent, who knows Laura well, explains that for years the President has used visits to his daughter as a cover for extramarital affairs, and that he pulled Laura's Secret Service detail to use as extra protection for himself during the latest trip, leaving her vulnerable to the members of the sex trafficking ring.\n\nScott enlists Sergeant Black to help him rescue the girl from Dubai and turns to Avi, a former Israeli operative. Avi agrees to get him into Dubai and smuggle Laura out concealed in a cargo container at the airport, obtaining weapons for him and support from a local man known as Jones.\n\nJones is killed during the rescue and Scott flees with Laura to a safe house, where he persuades her that although he is alone, he is acting under orders. Correctly guessing that he is really acting on his own, Laura says that King [[Leonidas I|Leonidas]] of [[Sparta]] would respond to requests for help from neighboring kingdoms by sending one man, and decides to trust him.\n\nWhen he takes Laura to the airport to seal her in the cargo container, Scott discovers he is being tracked when he finds a transmitter hidden in his knife. He rushes her out of the container just as his old team arrives to apprehend them. Scott is shot and Laura is captured. Her captor reveals herself as Sgt. Black, who shows her the earring and photos from the Secret Service agent, convincing Laura to stop struggling. A Swedish news crew witnesses the struggle as they are about to board their own plane nearby, and recognize Laura. Black is shot, and a hysterical Laura is hustled to safety aboard the journalists' plane. Scott finds the injured Black, who asks if Laura is now safe, which Scott confirms.\n\nLater, on a London city street, a stubbled Scott is shown watching an evening news broadcast regarding Laura's return on a television in a shop window. The government spins the story of Laura's kidnapping as an opportunity for the President to take action to end the trafficking of American girls as sex slaves. A British man watching alongside Scott says, \"Time to go home,\" and walks away. Scott watches him leave and says, \"Lucky man.\" Scott is then seen walking off into [[Piccadilly Circus]].\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Val Kilmer]] as Robert Scott \n*[[Derek Luke]] as Curtis\n* [[Tia Texada]] as Sergeant Jackie Black\n* [[Kristen Bell]] as Laura Newton\n* [[Johnny Messner (actor)|Johnny Messner]] as Grace\n* [[Ed O'Neill]] as Robert Burch\n* [[William H.

His early years were spent in Dehri, at that time a small city in [[Valsad District]] in the state of [[Gujarat]], where modern conveniences, like electricity, did not yet exist. [[Farming]] was a natural, integral part of life, changing according to the season, but regulated by the [[monsoon]], which signaled the beginning of a new production season.\n\nAs a child, Bhaskar Save learned the value of [[cooperation]]. Like most other local farmers, Save's family grew mainly [[rice]], [[pulses]], and some [[vegetables]]. People often worked together on each other's [[field (agriculture)|fields]] when extra hands were needed to transplant or harvest a [[paddy field]].\n\nOften, he accompanied his father on [[bullock cart]] trips through [[forests]] to neighboring areas. After encountering the [[Warli]] tribe, he was fascinated by their way of life and culture, and particularly awed by their belief that God lived in green trees. Among the Warli, trees were never cut down till they dried and shed all trace of green from their body. It was an idea that struck a chord and was to be applied in his own farming career, since the planting of tree crops was not a part of his family's traditional agricultural practices.\n\nHis formal education included \"Standard 7\" of the old system (equivalent to \"class 10\" today), followed by two years of work towards the Primary Training Certificate. This qualified him to teach in a [[secondary school]] in a neighboring village, which he did for 10 years.<ref>From Chapter 4 of ''The Vision of Natural Farming'' by Bharat Mansata.</ref>\n\nOn 2 February 1951, Bhaskar Save married Maltiben, who has since been his companion. The same year, the Save family began digging their [[water well|well]]. By 1952, the well was completed and a [[waterwheel]] was constructed. After harvesting their monsoon rice, the family grew irrigated winter vegetables. And for the first time in his life, Bhaskar Save used [[chemical fertilizer]], together with [[feces|dung]] manure \u2013 for his vegetable plants. And, in 1953, he used chemicals for his rain-fed [[rice paddy]] as well.\n\nThe harvest he reaped attracted attention from a director of the Gujarat State Fertilizer Corporation who offered Save an agency contract for marketing their chemical fertilizer. His job included instructing farmers in its use, for which he was promised a commission of Rs 5 on every bag of the chemicals he sold. Soon, Save was recognized as a \"model farmer\" for his use of the new technology. Several agricultural scientists from [[Pune]] and elsewhere drew on his experience for conducting their field trials.\n\nBy 1954\u201355, Save had already earned enough money to buy one hectare of land suitable for growing rice to begin his own family farm. This was the first of the plots purchased on which today stands the Save family's Kalpavruksha farm, now a 6 [[hectare]] orchard, in Umbergaon region, a coastal zone of [[South Gujarat]].<ref>[http://savesanghavi.com/kalpavruksh.htm Kalpavruksha Farm] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120623202128/http://savesanghavi.com/kalpavruksh.htm |date=June 23, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nBy 1956, Save reverted to his father's traditional farming methods. However, inspired by both the writings of [[Gandhi]] and [[Vinoba Bhave]], particularly an article by Vinoba on farming practices of certain [[adivasis]], he decided to revert to an organic system on one paddy for experimentation. This called for changing the impounded water several times in one plot (during pauses in the monsoon rains), without using any chemicals. This, too, was successful.\n\nThough his yield declined the first year, so did his expenses and gradually he converted more acreage, which he reserved entirely for organic experimentation. Organic methods of [[crop rotation]], the planting of un-irrigated pulse [[legumes]], like beans, [[gram|Bengal]], [[moong]], and so on after harvesting his organic rice were implemented. He found that winter pulses, which supplied an abundance of atmospheric nitrogen in the soil, grew entirely on the sub-soil moisture still present from the recent monsoon. When the pulses were harvested, cattle were allowed to browse the [[crop residue]] in the field, thereby [[recycling]] their manure to condition the soil as well.\n\nIn 1957, Bhaskar Save built a small home on his new, now present, farm, which had grown to two hectares and moved there with his family. Raising an [[orchard]] was now his major preoccupation, and he wanted to spend more time working and observing. By 1960, he had completely eliminated the use of chemicals on his farm.\n\n== Save's Philosophy of Natural Farming ==\n[[File:Coconut trees (15).JPG|thumb|right|Long-life coconut trees]]\nBhaskar Save developed his system of natural farming after being induced to use chemical fertilizers, which after three years he realized was not returning value to him or his land. He later commented that: \"By ruining the natural fertility of the soil, we actually create artificial 'needs' for more and more external inputs and unnecessary inputs for ourselves, while the results are inferior and more expensive in every way.\"<ref>Bhaskar Save's farming methods and philosophy are detailed in the book, ''The Vision of Natural Farming'' by Bharat Mansata. Mumbai: Earthcare Books, 2010.</ref>\n\nThe concept and practice of [[Natural Farming]] was pioneered by [[Masanobu Fukuoka]] of [[Japan]], who visited Save at his Kalpavruksh farm in 1997<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ft0ylk4sU5M#t=82 ''Natural Farming with Masanobu Fukoka''] A full-length documentary following the legendary Masanobu Fukuoka on a visit to India.</ref> as a special guest to commemorate India's 50 years of independence led by [[Mahatma Gandhi]]. While both men depended on tree crops for the [[sustainability]] of their farms, Save organized his own vision of natural farming far more aggressively around the active [[irrigation]] of his [[orchard|tree crops]], supplemented by grains, vegetables, and livestock, as did Fukuoka. Save is credited with pioneering the ''platform and trench'' system to provide water to his tree crops storing moisture in the soil year round. In the beginning, in order to sustain his farm until the long-life fruit trees matured and yielded value, he integrated short, medium and long-life plant species into his early scheme to rapidly establish complete ground cover and optimize yield.<ref>\"Water-efficient Trench Irrigation for Horticulture\", published in ''Good Practices & Innovative Experiences in the South'', Volume 2, 2001, co-published by [[UNDP]], TWN & [[Zed Books]].</ref> Briefly, Save's polyculture plant categories and natural farming philosophy are based on this pattern:\n\n* '''Short-life span crops''', which refer to annual vegetables, grains, herbs, annual flowers.\n* '''Medium-life span edible crops''', which include flowers, grains, grasses and fruit trees.\n* '''Long-life span crops''', which are perennial vegetables, such as rhubarb, horseradish, asparagus; perennial herbs, some [[alliums]] (leeks, chives, garlic), some members of the [[Brassica]] family (collards and kale); and bramble fruits (raspberry, blueberry, and blackberry), nut trees (filbert, chestnut, almond, or pecan), fruit trees ([[kalpavriksha]], [[chikoo]], and coconut), and some grasses, like alfalfa.\n\n[[File:Manilkara Zapota in HK.JPG|thumb|right|Chikoo or Sapodilla, a long-life evergreen fruit-bearing tree]]\nSave's idea for platforms resulted from a need to grow trees on low-lying paddy fields. To elevate the land, he constructed raised earthen mounds or [[berms]] and was then able to plant his saplings. Initially, he simply broaden the berms between his rice plots, depending solely on the monsoon rains for moisture. Later, he was granted permission by the village [[panchayat]] to excavate at his own expense a village pond on some uncultivated common land near his farm. The soil that was dug out \u2013 as the pond was gradually enlarged and deepened each year \u2013 further served to elevate and expand his \"platforms\" for the trees.\n\nInitially, the saplings of [[coconut]] or [[chikoo]] (long life-span species) were [[intercropped]] only with vegetables (short life-span species). Later, Bhaskar Save integrated other crops like bananas and [[papayas]] (medium life-span) among his chikoos and coconuts \u2013 to optimize the use of the available sunlight until the long-life trees matured and cast thick shade on the ground. Today, 90% of the family's income is earned from chikoo and coconut production.\n\nIn 2006, Bhaskar Save, published an \u201c[[Open Letter]]\u201d to the Minister of Agriculture and other top officials to bring attention to the mounting suicide rate and debt among farmers and to encourage them to abandon their policies of importing and promoting the use of toxic chemical fertilizers that were a source of the problem.<ref>http://greatagriculturalchallenge.wordpress.com/the-great-agricultural-challenge/preface/register/bhaskar-save%E2%80%99s-open-letter/</ref>\n\n== Recognition ==\n\nBeyond the many awards that Bhaskar Save has received, his  reworking of an ancient ''trench and platform'' system for irrigated fruit trees, like [[banana]], chikoo and coconut has been recognized by the [[United Nations]] (2001) and others as one of the most important orchard production systems in the world.

To elevate the land, he constructed raised earthen mounds or [[berms]] and was then able to plant his saplings. Initially, he simply broaden the berms between his rice plots, depending solely on the monsoon rains for moisture. Later, he was granted permission by the village [[panchayat]] to excavate at his own expense a village pond on some uncultivated common land near his farm. The soil that was dug out \u2013 as the pond was gradually enlarged and deepened each year \u2013 further served to elevate and expand his \"platforms\" for the trees.\n\nInitially, the saplings of [[coconut]] or [[chikoo]] (long life-span species) were [[intercropped]] only with vegetables (short life-span species). Later, Bhaskar Save integrated other crops like bananas and [[papayas]] (medium life-span) among his chikoos and coconuts \u2013 to optimize the use of the available sunlight until the long-life trees matured and cast thick shade on the ground. Today, 90% of the family's income is earned from chikoo and coconut production.\n\nIn 2006, Bhaskar Save, published an \u201c[[Open Letter]]\u201d to the Minister of Agriculture and other top officials to bring attention to the mounting suicide rate and debt among farmers and to encourage them to abandon their policies of importing and promoting the use of toxic chemical fertilizers that were a source of the problem.<ref>http://greatagriculturalchallenge.wordpress.com/the-great-agricultural-challenge/preface/register/bhaskar-save%E2%80%99s-open-letter/</ref>\n\n== Recognition ==\n\nBeyond the many awards that Bhaskar Save has received, his  reworking of an ancient ''trench and platform'' system for irrigated fruit trees, like [[banana]], chikoo and coconut has been recognized by the [[United Nations]] (2001) and others as one of the most important orchard production systems in the world.

These vessels may be from either a [[Velamentous cord insertion|velamentous insertion of the umbilical cord]] or may be joining an accessory (succenturiate) placental lobe to the main disk of the placenta. If these fetal vessels rupture the bleeding is from the fetoplacental circulation, and fetal [[exsanguination]] will rapidly occur, leading to fetal death. It is thought that vasa previa arises from an early placenta previa. As the pregnancy progresses, the placenta tissue surrounding the vessels over the cervix undergoes atrophy, and the placenta grows preferentially toward the upper portion of the uterus. This leaves unprotected vessels running over the cervix and in the lower uterine segment. This has been demonstrated using serial ultrasound. Oyelese et al. found that 2/3 of patient with vasa previa at delivery had a low-lying placenta or placenta previa that resolved prior to the time of delivery. \nThere are three types of vasa previa. Types 1 and 2 were described by Catanzarite et al. In Type 1, there is a velamentous insertion with vessels running over the cervix. In Type 2, unprotected vessels run between lobes of a bilobed or succenturiate lobed placenta. In Type 3, a portion of the placenta overlying the cervix undergoes atrophy. In this type, there is a normal placental cord insertion and the placenta has only one lobe. However, vessels at a margin of the placenta are exposed.\n\n===Risk factors===\nVasa previa is seen more commonly with velamentous insertion of the umbilical cord, accessory placental lobes ([[succenturiate placenta|succenturiate]] or [[bilobate placenta]]), multiple gestation, and [[in vitro fertilisation]] pregnancy. In IVF pregnancies, incidences as high as one in 300 have been reported{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}. The reasons for this association are not clear, but disturbed orientation of the [[blastocyst]] at implantation, [[vanishing embryo]]s and the increased frequency of placental morphological variations in IVF pregnancies have all been postulated{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}.\n\n==Diagnosis==\n* The classic triad of the vasa praevia is: membrane rupture, painless vaginal bleeding and fetal [[bradycardia]] or fetal death.\n* Prior to the advent of ultrasound, this diagnosis was most often made after a stillbirth or neonatal death in which the mother had ruptured her membranes, had some bleeding, and delivered an exsanguinated baby. In these cases, examination of the placenta and membranes after delivery would show evidence of a velamentous cord insertion with rupture of the vessels. However, with almost universal use of ultrasound in the developed world, many cases are now detected during pregnancy, giving the opportunity to deliver the baby before this catastrophic rupture of the membranes occurs.  Vasa previa is diagnosed with ultrasound when echolucent linear or tubular structures are found overlying the cervix or in close proximity to it. Transvaginal ultrasound is the preferred modality. Color, power and pulsed wave Doppler should be used to confirm that the structures are fetal vessels. The vessels will demonstrate a fetal arterial or venous waveform.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Lijoi A, Brady J | title = Vasa previa diagnosis and management. | journal = J Am Board Fam Pract | volume = 16 | issue = 6 | pages = 543\u20138 | year = 2003| pmid = 14963081 | doi = 10.3122/jabfm.16.6.543}}''[http://www.jabfm.org/cgi/content/full/16/6/543 Full text]''</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Lee W, Lee V, Kirk J, Sloan C, Smith R, Comstock C | title = Vasa previa: prenatal diagnosis, natural evolution, and clinical outcome. | journal = Obstet Gynecol | volume = 95 | issue = 4 | pages = 572\u20136 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10725492 | doi = 10.1016/S0029-7844(99)00600-6}}</ref>\n*Alkali denaturation test detects the presence of fetal hemoglobin in vaginal blood, as fetal hemoglobin is resistant to denaturation in presence of 1% NaOH.

These tests are no longer widely used in the US, but are sometimes used in other parts of the world.\n* Also detection of fetal hemoglobin in vaginal bleeding is diagnostic.\n\n==Treatment==\nIt is recommended that women with vasa previa should deliver through elective cesarean prior to rupture of the membranes. Given the timing of membrane rupture is difficult to predict, elective cesarean delivery at 35\u201336 weeks is recommended. This gestational age gives a reasonable balance between the risk of death and that of prematurity. Several authorities have recommended hospital admission about 32 weeks. This is to give the patient proximity to the operating room for emergency delivery should the membranes rupture. Because these patients are at risk for preterm delivery, it is recommended that steroids should be given to promote fetal lung maturation.

He tests this theory and examines the boundaries of authority and his friendships. A few years before, a student, John Stanton ([[Michael Shannon]]) was committed to an insane asylum, for reasons unknown to most everybody except the principal. One day he escapes, releasing everyone else from the [[Psychiatric hospital|asylums]] around. Maddox sees this defiance which is the start of his anarchy. Maddox wants to \"help him\" and understand him more so they start a correspondence and Stanton tells him what to do and how to do it. This is includes the erasing of student grades, posting posters/fliers, and locking part of the student body in a room, among other things. Maddox gets his friends involved and challenges authority and gets most of the school behind him, including an administrator for a while.

He tests this theory and examines the boundaries of authority and his friendships. A few years before, a student, John Stanton ([[Michael Shannon]]) was committed to an insane asylum, for reasons unknown to most everybody except the principal. One day he escapes, releasing everyone else from the [[Psychiatric hospital|asylums]] around. Maddox sees this defiance which is the start of his anarchy. Maddox wants to \"help him\" and understand him more so they start a correspondence and Stanton tells him what to do and how to do it. This is includes the erasing of student grades, posting posters/fliers, and locking part of the student body in a room, among other things. Maddox gets his friends involved and challenges authority and gets most of the school behind him, including an administrator for a while. He is so consumed with creating chaos and disorder that his friends start to see the destruction, but they have to save themselves, and him before he can take complete control over the school.<ref>[https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/252769/New-Port-South/overview New Port South - The New York Times].
