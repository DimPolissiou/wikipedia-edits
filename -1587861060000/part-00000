The mausoleum contains the body of Nina Craigmiles, a seven-year-old who died on October 18, 1871, when a horse buggy in which she was riding was struck by a train. Her father, John Craigmiles, constructed the church and mausoleum in Nina's memory. He named the church St. Luke's because the girl died on St. Luke's Day.<ref>Kazek, Kelly (2011).

For example, in the [[United Kingdom|British]] jurisdiction of [[England and Wales]], the power comes from section 24A(2) of the [[Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1984/60/section/24A |title=Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 |publisher=The National Archives, UK |date=16 August 2011 |accessdate=20 April 2014}}</ref> called \"any person arrest\". This [[legislation]] states \"any person\" has these powers, and does not state that they need to be a [[British nationality law|British citizen]].\n\n==Legal and political aspects==\nAnyone who makes a citizen's arrest can find themselves facing possible [[lawsuit]]s or [[criminal charge]]s &ndash; such as charges of [[false imprisonment]], unlawful restraint, [[kidnapping]], or wrongful arrest &ndash; if the wrong person is apprehended or a suspect's [[civil rights]] are violated.<ref>{{cite web|title=REGINA -V- SELF; CACD 25 FEB 1992|url=http://swarb.co.uk/regina-v-self-cacd-25-feb-1992/|website=SWARB.CO.UK|publisher=SWARB.CO.UK|accessdate=2 December 2015}}</ref> This is especially true when [[police force]]s are attempting to determine who an [[aggression|aggressor]] is. Private citizens do not enjoy the same immunity from civil liability when making arrests on other private citizens as do police officers.\n\nThe level of responsibility that a person performing a citizen's arrest may bear depends on the jurisdiction.

Section 55(5) states \"For the purposes of this section, a person is said to be 'found offending' if he does any act, or makes any omission, or conducts or behaves himself, and thereby causes a person who finds him reasonable grounds for believing that he has, in respect of such act, omission, or conduct, committed an offence against this Act.\" There are further provisions in section 301 of the Criminal Code Act 1924 (Tas) that appear to allow a sliding scale of force in executing an arrest.\n\n====Western Australia====\nIt was only in 2004 that the [[Western Australia]]n parliament repealed the provisions of the former section 47 of the Police Act 1892 which allowed any person to arrest without a warrant \"any reputed common [[prostitute]], [[thief]], loose, idle or [[disorderly conduct|disorderly person]], who, within view of such person apprehending, shall offend against this Act, and shall forthwith deliver him to any constable or police officer of the place where he shall have been apprehended, to be taken and conveyed before a Justice, to be dealt with according to law \u2026\" A private citizen would have found it rather difficult to interpret the terms \"loose\" or \"idle\" with any degree of [[legal certainty]].

In other circumstances where, e.g., a property owner (or an agent) arrests a thief in a manner, and in circumstances, disproportionate to the likely harm to the victim, and in clear defiance of the rights of the suspect (for example, to be taken forthwith to a police station), then the court is very likely to find in favour of the suspect (guilty or otherwise).

Both have to wait for the arrival of the police. The person who makes a citizen's arrest has to sign the police forms as a witness and explain the facts.

Section 75 of the Criminal Procedure Law (Enforcement Powers \u2013 Arrest) of 1996 allows anyone to detain a person who is witnessed carrying out certain suspected crimes. The crimes include the following: a felony, theft, a crime of violence and a crime which has caused serious damage to property. A person using these detention powers may use reasonable force if their request is not met as long as they do not cause the suspect bruising. They must hand the suspect over to the police immediately and no later than three hours. Persons whose identity is known or who are not suspected of fleeing may not be detained. The law, which is relatively new, is used by both private individuals and private security but is problematic because it has not yet been interpreted by the courts. In early 2009, a magistrate's court in Jerusalem handed down a verdict convicting two private security officers of assault following a detention of a suspect who assaulted one of them. The court ruled that the guards were not allowed to detain the suspect who was seated in a taxi at the time and should have waited for the police to arrive.\n\n=== Italy ===\nAny private citizen can, according to article 383 of the [[Italian Code of Criminal Procedure]], arrest another person, provided they are caught \"''in flagranza di reato''\" ([[In flagrante delicto]]) and the felony they are caught committing includes mandatory arrest from the police and is \"''perseguibile d'ufficio''\", meaning that the judicial authority, once received the \"''notitia criminis''\" (a crime report), has the duty to commence prosecution, without a party necessarily filing a complaint. The person making the arrest is legally required to hand to police the arrested person and the corpus delicti to the judicial authority, failure to do so could result in the person making the arrest committing a crime.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.brocardi.it/codice-di-procedura-penale/libro-quinto/titolo-vi/art383.html|title=Art. 383 Codice di Procedura Penale|website=Brocardi.it}}</ref>\n\n===Japan===\nIn [[Japan]], Section 213 of the Code of Criminal Procedure allows anyone from civilians to firefighters witnessing any crime in progress to make an arrest.

However, Section 3 of the [[Criminal Law Act 1967]] allows any person to use [[reasonable force]] for the prevention of crime. This would not allow a citizen's arrest before an offence takes place in this sense but would allow any person to use reasonable force to prevent an offence from occurring; for example, restraining a suspected offender who raised a brick in their hand in order to imminently smash a window.\n\n\"Any person\" powers can be used to arrest ''before'' an offence occurs as long as the offence in question falls within the [[Criminal Attempts Act 1981]]. This act creates the offence of an ''attempted'' offence, as long as the offence being attempted is an [[indictable]] one. For this to apply, the offence must actually be in the process of being attempted &nbsp;&ndash;&#32; preparatory steps are not sufficient. For example, putting gloves on to smash a car window would not suffice, but the throwing of a brick at the window would. The definition of what constitutes a \"crime\" was clarified in ''R v Jones (Margaret)''<ref>https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200506/ldjudgmt/jd060329/jones-3.htm</ref> which stated under the S3 CLA1967 meaning, it was held to be any domestic crime in England/Wales. Kent Police have released a brief yet comprehensive [http://library.college.police.uk/docs/APPref/use-of-force-briefing.pdf guide] on reasonable force.<ref>http://library.college.police.uk/docs/APPref/use-of-force-briefing.pdf</ref>\n\nA citizen's arrest is a form of [[lawful custody]] and anyone attempting to flee may be guilty of attempting to [[escape from lawful custody]]. Furthermore, the offence of 'assault with intent to resist arrest or lawful apprehension or detainer of himself' may apply if the arrestee assaulted the arrestor under Section 38 of the [[Offences Against the Person Act 1861]].<ref>http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/24-25/100/section/38</ref> Both assault with intent to resist arrest/lawful apprehension and escaping from lawful custody are indictable, the former being so by the mode of trial of the offence, the latter is a [[common law]] offence and therefore [[indictable]] only. Therefore, these offences - whether fully carried out or merely attempted - are citizen's arrestable in themselves.\n\n(See also - [[Criminal Attempts Act 1981]])\n\nIn addition to the above, a private person may be authorised to execute an [[arrest warrant]], if the [[court]] issuing the warrant has given them the authority to do so.\n\nA citizen's arrest may also be made technically for a warrant for an arrest if the offence listed is indictable as there is no law prohibiting a re-citizen's arrest or the number of times they may be arrested for it nor is there a time limit. The warrant would satisfy the requirement for the arrester to have reasonable grounds to suspect the guilt of the arrestee. For example, if an offender failed to attend [[Crown court]] this would satisfy two conditions for a lawful citizen's arrest at a later date - that the offence ''had'' taken place and that it was obviously indictable by way of being tried in Crown court.\n\n===== Other Powers =====\n\nAlthough not technically citizen's arrest powers, any person also has the power to arrest for a [[common law]] [[breach of the peace]] which also provides any person with a [[power of entry]]. Section 3 [[Criminal Justice Act 1967]] provides any person the power to apprehend a person [[unlawfully at large]] e.g. an offender on a recall to prison or in the circumstances where someone has managed to [[escape from lawful custody]].\n\n{{See also|Breach of the peace#England, Wales and Northern Ireland}}\n\nAny person may arrest an individual/individuals to prevent an occurring, repeated, or an about to occur [[breach of the peace]].

Section 55(5) states \"For the purposes of this section, a person is said to be 'found offending' if he does any act, or makes any omission, or conducts or behaves himself, and thereby causes a person who finds him reasonable grounds for believing that he has, in respect of such act, omission, or conduct, committed an offence against this Act.\" There are further provisions in section 301 of the Criminal Code Act 1924 (Tas) that appear to allow a sliding scale of force in executing an arrest.\n\n====Western Australia====\nIt was only in 2004 that the [[Western Australia]]n parliament repealed the provisions of the former section 47 of the Police Act 1892 which allowed any person to arrest without a warrant \"any reputed common [[prostitute]], [[thief]], loose, idle or [[disorderly conduct|disorderly person]], who, within view of such person apprehending, shall offend against this Act, and shall forthwith deliver him to any constable or police officer of the place where he shall have been apprehended, to be taken and conveyed before a Justice, to be dealt with according to law \u2026\" A private citizen would have found it rather difficult to interpret the terms \"loose\" or \"idle\" with any degree of [[legal certainty]].

In other circumstances where, e.g., a property owner (or an agent) arrests a thief in a manner, and in circumstances, disproportionate to the likely harm to the victim, and in clear defiance of the rights of the suspect (for example, to be taken forthwith to a police station), then the court is very likely to find in favour of the suspect (guilty or otherwise).

Both have to wait for the arrival of the police. The person who makes a citizen's arrest has to sign the police forms as a witness and explain the facts.

Section 75 of the Criminal Procedure Law (Enforcement Powers \u2013 Arrest) of 1996 allows anyone to detain a person who is witnessed carrying out certain suspected crimes. The crimes include the following: a felony, theft, a crime of violence and a crime which has caused serious damage to property. A person using these detention powers may use reasonable force if their request is not met as long as they do not cause the suspect bruising. They must hand the suspect over to the police immediately and no later than three hours. Persons whose identity is known or who are not suspected of fleeing may not be detained. The law, which is relatively new, is used by both private individuals and private security but is problematic because it has not yet been interpreted by the courts. In early 2009, a magistrate's court in Jerusalem handed down a verdict convicting two private security officers of assault following a detention of a suspect who assaulted one of them. The court ruled that the guards were not allowed to detain the suspect who was seated in a taxi at the time and should have waited for the police to arrive.\n\n=== Italy ===\nAny private citizen can, according to article 383 of the [[Italian Code of Criminal Procedure]], arrest another person, provided they are caught \"''in flagranza di reato''\" ([[In flagrante delicto]]) and the felony they are caught committing includes mandatory arrest from the police and is \"''perseguibile d'ufficio''\", meaning that the judicial authority, once received the \"''notitia criminis''\" (a crime report), has the duty to commence prosecution, without a party necessarily filing a complaint. The person making the arrest is legally required to hand to police the arrested person and the corpus delicti to the judicial authority, failure to do so could result in the person making the arrest committing a crime.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.brocardi.it/codice-di-procedura-penale/libro-quinto/titolo-vi/art383.html|title=Art. 383 Codice di Procedura Penale|website=Brocardi.it}}</ref>\n\n===Japan===\nIn [[Japan]], Section 213 of the Code of Criminal Procedure allows anyone from civilians to firefighters witnessing any crime in progress to make an arrest.

However, Section 3 of the [[Criminal Law Act 1967]] allows any person to use [[reasonable force]] for the prevention of crime. This would not allow a citizen's arrest before an offence takes place in this sense but would allow any person to use reasonable force to prevent an offence from occurring; for example, restraining a suspected offender who raised a brick in their hand in order to imminently smash a window.\n\n\"Any person\" powers can be used to arrest ''before'' an offence occurs as long as the offence in question falls within the [[Criminal Attempts Act 1981]]. This act creates the offence of an ''attempted'' offence, as long as the offence being attempted is an [[indictable]] one. For this to apply, the offence must actually be in the process of being attempted &nbsp;&ndash;&#32; preparatory steps are not sufficient. For example, putting gloves on to smash a car window would not suffice, but the throwing of a brick at the window would. The definition of what constitutes a \"crime\" was clarified in ''R v Jones (Margaret)''<ref>https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200506/ldjudgmt/jd060329/jones-3.htm</ref> which stated under the S3 CLA1967 meaning, it was held to be any domestic crime in England/Wales. Kent Police have released a brief yet comprehensive [http://library.college.police.uk/docs/APPref/use-of-force-briefing.pdf guide] on reasonable force.<ref>http://library.college.police.uk/docs/APPref/use-of-force-briefing.pdf</ref>\n\nA citizen's arrest is a form of [[lawful custody]] and anyone attempting to flee may be guilty of attempting to [[escape from lawful custody]]. Furthermore, the offence of 'assault with intent to resist arrest or lawful apprehension or detainer of himself' may apply if the arrestee assaulted the arrestor under Section 38 of the [[Offences Against the Person Act 1861]].<ref>http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/24-25/100/section/38</ref> Both assault with intent to resist arrest/lawful apprehension and escaping from lawful custody are indictable, the former being so by the mode of trial of the offence, the latter is a [[common law]] offence and therefore [[indictable]] only. Therefore, these offences - whether fully carried out or merely attempted - are citizen's arrestable in themselves.\n\n(See also - [[Criminal Attempts Act 1981]])\n\nIn addition to the above, a private person may be authorised to execute an [[arrest warrant]], if the [[court]] issuing the warrant has given them the authority to do so.\n\nA citizen's arrest may also be made technically for a warrant for an arrest if the offence listed is indictable as there is no law prohibiting a re-citizen's arrest or the number of times they may be arrested for it nor is there a time limit. The warrant would satisfy the requirement for the arrester to have reasonable grounds to suspect the guilt of the arrestee. For example, if an offender failed to attend [[Crown court]] this would satisfy two conditions for a lawful citizen's arrest at a later date - that the offence ''had'' taken place and that it was obviously indictable by way of being tried in Crown court.\n\n===== Other Powers =====\n\nAlthough not technically citizen's arrest powers, any person also has the power to arrest for a [[common law]] [[breach of the peace]] which also provides any person with a [[power of entry]]. Section 3 [[Criminal Justice Act 1967]] provides any person the power to apprehend a person [[unlawfully at large]] e.g. an offender on a recall to prison or in the circumstances where someone has managed to [[escape from lawful custody]].\n\n{{See also|Breach of the peace#England, Wales and Northern Ireland}}\n\nAny person may arrest an individual/individuals to prevent an occurring, repeated, or an about to occur [[breach of the peace]].

For example, in Virginia, the statute appears to only permit warrantless arrests by officers listed in the Code.<ref>{{cite web|title=\u00a719.2-81 Arrest Without a Warrant|url=http://law.justia.com/codes/virginia/2006/toc1902000/19.2-81.html|work=Code of Virginia}}</ref> However Virginia courts have upheld warrantless arrests by non-law enforcement personnel for breach of the peace misdemeanors.<ref>{{cite web|title=Edward Thomas WILSON v.

The band originated in the Department of Antioquia, where iconic extreme metal groups have also emerged, such as Parabellum and Masacre. In 2005, he began an alternative musical project called Nybram<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.corporacionculturalnybram.com/|title=Corporaci\u00f3n Cultural Nybram|website=www.corporacionculturalnybram.com|access-date=2020-04-23}}</ref> which focuses its exercise on the research of traditional and native music from local ethnic groups and on narratives with Colombian literary, poetic and cultural heritage content.\n\nIn addition, he has his solo studio project called [[Flagelation]] where he plays all the instruments. This project was born in 2006 in response to a serious fire which devastated Vitam Et Mortem\u2019s rehearsal place, and where all the musicians, except for ''Thanatos'', lost their instruments and amplification equipment. The group was inactive for six months so in this period, Julian writes and publishes his debut solo album \"Prostitute of darkness\" a similar approach to bands like [[Vital Remains]], Nile, [[Hate Eternal]] [[Spawn of Possession|Spawn of Possesion]] and [[Cannibal Corpse]]. He has also joined Death Metal band Hedor as guest singer in 2019.\n\n== Academic Studies And Formation ==\n\nIn 2010 Juli\u00e1n David Trujillo Moreno began his training as a professional singer and musician at the University of Antioquia where he quickly stood out for his innate skills as a composer, thereby achieving a double academic training that was guided by the teachers Jorge L\u00f3pez and Johann Hasler in regards to composition and also by Diver Higuita and Ernesto S\u00e1nchez in singing.\n\nLikewise, he participated in the opera workshop of the University of Antioquia as tenor in different stagings such as: The bat by Johann Strauss, the Verdi Gala and Donizetti's L'elisir d'amore (The Elixir of Love) with the Medell\u00edn Philharmonic Orchestra.
