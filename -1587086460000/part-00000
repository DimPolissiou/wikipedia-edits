It was contested between the [[Western Conference (NHL)|Western Conference]] champion [[Detroit Red Wings]] and the [[Eastern Conference (NHL)|Eastern Conference]] champion [[Pittsburgh Penguins]]. This was Detroit's 23rd appearance in the Final, and its first since winning the Cup in [[2002 Stanley Cup Finals|2002]]. This was Pittsburgh's third appearance in the Final, and its first since winning consecutive Cup championships in [[1991 Stanley Cup Finals|1991]] and [[1992 Stanley Cup Finals|1992]]. The Red Wings defeated the Penguins four games to two to earn the Stanley Cup, marking the most recent professional sports championship for the team and the city of Detroit.

It was broadcast in Canada on [[Hockey Night in Canada|CBC]] in English and on [[R\u00e9seau des Sports|RDS]] in French. In the United Kingdom, all games were aired live on [[Five (channel)|Five]], and on the cable sports channel [[NASN]].

Led by forwards [[Henrik Zetterberg]], [[Pavel Datsyuk]], and [[Johan Franz\u00e9n|Johan Franzen]], Detroit scored 55 goals in the first three rounds of the playoffs. With struggling goaltender [[Dominik Ha\u0161ek|Dominik Hasek]] being replaced mid-series by [[Chris Osgood]], the Red Wings defeated their division rival [[Nashville Predators]] in the Western Conference Quarterfinals, in six games. The team swept the [[Colorado Avalanche]] in the Western Conference Semifinal round, in which Franzen scored nine goals \u2013 tying with the entire Avalanche squad, who also scored nine goals in the series. The Red Wings then defeated the [[Dallas Stars]] in six games to win their fifth [[Clarence S. Campbell Bowl]] in franchise history.\n\nThe [[Pittsburgh Penguins]] entered the championship series after winning the [[Atlantic Division (NHL)|Atlantic Division]] and earning the second-best regular season record in the [[Eastern Conference (NHL)|Eastern Conference]]. The team was led by [[Sidney Crosby]]; missing 29 games throughout the regular season because of an ankle injury, the captain returned to lead the first three rounds of the playoffs in assists, and to tie for the lead in points heading into the Stanley Cup Final. Goaltender [[Marc-Andr\u00e9 Fleury|Marc-Andre Fleury]] recorded three shutouts throughout the playoffs, to lead the league in that category. [[Evgeni Malkin]] and [[Mari\u00e1n Hossa|Marian Hossa]] each recorded nine goals and ten assists throughout the playoffs. The Penguins swept the [[Ottawa Senators]] in the Eastern Conference Quarterfinals, a reversal of [[2007 Stanley Cup playoffs#(4) Ottawa Senators vs. (5) Pittsburgh Penguins|the series of the previous season]] when Ottawa beat Pittsburgh 4\u20131. In the Eastern Conference Semifinals, the Penguins defeated division rival the [[New York Rangers]], in five games. The team won the [[Prince of Wales Trophy]] by defeating another division rival, their [[Flyers\u2013Penguins rivalry|in-state rival]]s, and another fierce [[Flyers\u2013Rangers rivalry|rival]] of the Rangers, the [[Philadelphia Flyers]], also in five games.\n\n==Game summaries==\nThe 2008 Stanley Cup Finals marked the first time that the Detroit Red Wings and the Pittsburgh Penguins met in postseason play, and the first time since the [[1909 World Series]] that professional sports teams from [[Detroit]] and [[Pittsburgh]] met in a postseason series or game.

The remainder of the first period went scoreless, as Pittsburgh failed to capitalize on four consecutive power plays. At 13:01 into the second period, [[Mikael Samuelsson]] gave the Red Wings the unassisted game-winning goal, on a wrap-around. Just over two minutes into the third period, Samuelsson added his second unassisted goal of the game. At 17:18 into the third period, [[Dan Cleary]] scored shorthanded to give the Red Wings a 3\u20130 lead. [[Henrik Zetterberg]] scored on the power-play with 13 seconds remaining.

It was contested between the [[Western Conference (NHL)|Western Conference]] champion [[Detroit Red Wings]] and the [[Eastern Conference (NHL)|Eastern Conference]] champion [[Pittsburgh Penguins]]. This was Detroit's 23rd appearance in the Final, and its first since winning the Cup in [[2002 Stanley Cup Finals|2002]]. This was Pittsburgh's third appearance in the Final, and its first since winning consecutive Cup championships in [[1991 Stanley Cup Finals|1991]] and [[1992 Stanley Cup Finals|1992]]. The Red Wings defeated the Penguins four games to two to earn the Stanley Cup, marking the most recent professional sports championship for the team and the city of Detroit. Detroit's [[Henrik Zetterberg]] was awarded the [[Conn Smythe Trophy]] as the [[Most Valuable Player]] of the playoffs.<ref>{{cite news |title= Detroit Red Wings win Stanley Cup|url=http://www.cbc.ca/sportsnews/story/2008/06/04/det-pit-six.html|publisher= [[CBC.ca|CBC]]|date= June 4, 2008|accessdate=June 4, 2008 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080605135525/http://www.cbc.ca/sportsnews/story/2008/06/04/det-pit-six.html| archivedate= June 5, 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\nThis was Detroit's 11th Stanley Cup title and was also the first Cup Finals between two United States-based NHL teams since [[2003 Stanley Cup Finals|2003]].\n\nIn the United States, [[NHL on Versus|Versus]] televised games one and two, and [[NHL on NBC|NBC]] broadcast the rest of the series. It was broadcast in Canada on [[Hockey Night in Canada|CBC]] in English and on [[R\u00e9seau des Sports|RDS]] in French. In the United Kingdom, all games were aired live on [[Five (channel)|Five]], and on the cable sports channel [[NASN]]. The series was also broadcast by NHL Radio via [[Westwood One (1976\u20132011)|Westwood One]].\n\n==Paths to the Finals==\n{{details|2008 Stanley Cup playoffs}}\nThe [[Detroit Red Wings]] entered the Finals after winning the [[Presidents' Trophy]] as the team that had the best record during the regular season. Led by forwards [[Henrik Zetterberg]], [[Pavel Datsyuk]], and [[Johan Franz\u00e9n|Johan Franzen]], Detroit scored 55 goals in the first three rounds of the playoffs. With struggling goaltender [[Dominik Ha\u0161ek|Dominik Hasek]] being replaced mid-series by [[Chris Osgood]], the Red Wings defeated their division rival [[Nashville Predators]] in the Western Conference Quarterfinals, in six games. The team swept the [[Colorado Avalanche]] in the Western Conference Semifinal round, in which Franzen scored nine goals \u2013 tying with the entire Avalanche squad, who also scored nine goals in the series. The Red Wings then defeated the [[Dallas Stars]] in six games to win their fifth [[Clarence S. Campbell Bowl]] in franchise history.\n\nThe [[Pittsburgh Penguins]] entered the championship series after winning the [[Atlantic Division (NHL)|Atlantic Division]] and earning the second-best regular season record in the [[Eastern Conference (NHL)|Eastern Conference]]. The team was led by [[Sidney Crosby]]; missing 29 games throughout the regular season because of an ankle injury, the captain returned to lead the first three rounds of the playoffs in assists, and to tie for the lead in points heading into the Stanley Cup Final. Goaltender [[Marc-Andr\u00e9 Fleury|Marc-Andre Fleury]] recorded three shutouts throughout the playoffs, to lead the league in that category. [[Evgeni Malkin]] and [[Mari\u00e1n Hossa|Marian Hossa]] each recorded nine goals and ten assists throughout the playoffs. The Penguins swept the [[Ottawa Senators]] in the Eastern Conference Quarterfinals, a reversal of [[2007 Stanley Cup playoffs#(4) Ottawa Senators vs. (5) Pittsburgh Penguins|the series of the previous season]] when Ottawa beat Pittsburgh 4\u20131. In the Eastern Conference Semifinals, the Penguins defeated division rival the [[New York Rangers]], in five games. The team won the [[Prince of Wales Trophy]] by defeating another division rival, their [[Flyers\u2013Penguins rivalry|in-state rival]]s, and another fierce [[Flyers\u2013Rangers rivalry|rival]] of the Rangers, the [[Philadelphia Flyers]], also in five games.\n\n==Game summaries==\nThe 2008 Stanley Cup Finals marked the first time that the Detroit Red Wings and the Pittsburgh Penguins met in postseason play, and the first time since the [[1909 World Series]] that professional sports teams from [[Detroit]] and [[Pittsburgh]] met in a postseason series or game. The Red Wings and Penguins did not play each other during the 2007\u201308 regular season.\n\n===Game one===\n\n{{NHLPlayoffs\n |team1 = [[Pittsburgh Penguins]]\n |team2 = [[Detroit Red Wings]]\n |stadium1 = [[Joe Louis Arena]]\n |date1 = May 24\n |score1 = 0-4\n |won1 = 2\n |recap1 = www.nhl.com/nhl/app?service=page&page=Recap&gameNumber=411&season=20072008&gameType=3\n}}\nPittsburgh's [[Gary Roberts (ice hockey)|Gary Roberts]] and Detroit's [[Chris Chelios]] were both healthy scratches for game one.

Each dropped a puck to their current captains [[Sidney Crosby]] and [[Nicklas Lidstr\u00f6m|Nicklas Lidstrom]], respectively.\n\nAt 15:20 into the first period, a goal scored by Lidstrom was waved off after [[Tomas Holmstr\u00f6m|Tomas Holmstrom]] was called for goaltender interference. The remainder of the first period went scoreless, as Pittsburgh failed to capitalize on four consecutive power plays. At 13:01 into the second period, [[Mikael Samuelsson]] gave the Red Wings the unassisted game-winning goal, on a wrap-around. Just over two minutes into the third period, Samuelsson added his second unassisted goal of the game.

As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], the population of Opelika was 26,401,<ref name=\"Census 2010\"/> and in 2018 the estimated population was 30,555.<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\"/> The [[Auburn, Alabama, metropolitan area|Auburn-Opelika, AL MSA]] with a population of 150,933, along with the [[Columbus, Georgia metropolitan area]], comprises the [[Columbus\u2013Auburn\u2013Opelika, GA\u2013AL CSA|Greater Columbus]] combined statistical area, a region home to 501,649 residents.\n\n[[File:Historic Downtown Marker.jpg|thumb|Opelika's historic downtown]]\n\n==History==\nThe first white settlers in the area now known as Opelika arrived in the late 1830s and established a community called Lebanon. After the removal of the native Creek (Muscogee) peoples by federal troops in 1836\u201337, the area became known as \"Opelika.\" This word taken from the [[Creek language|Muskogee]] language means \"large swamp\".\n\nIn 1848, the Montgomery and West Point Railroad Company extended a rail line from [[Montgomery, Alabama]], to Opelika, and in 1851, completed a connection to [[West Point, Georgia]], thus connecting Opelika with [[Atlanta, Georgia]]. This line was the only direct rail route between [[New Orleans]] and the [[East Coast of the United States|Eastern Seaboard]]. It rapidly became one of the primary trade lines for shipments of raw cotton from [[Southern United States|Southern]] plantations to the North. The Montgomery and West Point was soon joined by a rail connection to [[Columbus, Georgia]], in 1855, and a connection to [[Birmingham, Alabama]], in 1869. Almost overnight, Opelika became a regional hub for commerce.\n\nTo manage this rapid growth, Opelika was incorporated as a town on February 9, 1854, then within [[Russell County, Alabama|Russell County]]. As a result of Opelika's transportation infrastructure, many warehouses for storing cotton and other goods were built. With the onset of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], these warehouses were converted to [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] supply depots. In 1864 and 1865, Union raids commanded by [[Lovell Rousseau]] and [[James H. Wilson]] attacked Opelika, tearing up the railroads and destroying all government property, including Opelika's warehouses.\n\nSoon after the end of the war, the Alabama state legislature created a new county out of parts of [[Macon County, Alabama|Macon]], Russell, [[Chambers County, Alabama|Chambers]], and [[Tallapoosa County, Alabama|Tallapoosa]] Counties to be named after Confederate general [[Robert E. Lee]]. In 1866, citizens of the new \"[[Lee County, Alabama|Lee County]]\" voted Opelika as the county seat. The town was technically unincorporated after having its charter revoked for abetting the rebellion against the United States.\n\nAfter Opelika received a new charter in 1870, rapid growth resumed. The town nearly doubled in size between 1870 and 1900. During this time, Opelika began to gain a reputation as a wild, lawless town.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} Soon after receiving the new charter, city officials attempted to scam outside investors by issuing fake railroad bonds. For this, the town's charter was revoked again in 1872, and the town was administered as a police district by the state legislature for the following year. {{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}\n\nOpelika's downtown was packed with [[bar (establishment)|saloons]] catering to railroad workers and other men. Frequent gunfire in the street by intoxicated patrons resulted in railroads directing their passengers to duck beneath the windows when their trains passed through the town.<ref name=\"nyt\">[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9806E0D6143DE533A25756C1A9649D94639FD7CF \"The Battle Of The Bar-rooms; Murderous Factions Fights In Alabama\u2014Death Of Maloney In Opelika\"], ''New York Times'', 15 December 1882, accessed 4 April 2016.</ref>\n\nIn 1882, two factions claimed to rule the city government, one known as the \"Bar room\" headed by Mayor Dunbar, a saloon keeper, and another known as the \"Citizens\". In a riot in late November\u2013December of that year, a dozen men were wounded. In the end, a few were killed. The Citizens had claimed control of the city via the elections, but Dunbar refused to give up. After continued violence, the state legislature revoked the city's charter and the governor sent in the [[militia]] to restore order. The legislature appointed five commissioners to manage the city,<ref name=\"nyt\"/> a situation that continued until 1899. That year, the legislature restored the city's charter.\n\n===1900 to present===\nIn 1900, local investors founded the Opelika Cotton Mill as the first textile plant in the city, employing 125. The city was located on the [[Atlantic Seaboard fall line|Fall Line]] of the Piedmont, where factories were established to take advantage of water power. Attempts to expand the textile industry in Opelika continued for the next three decades. In 1925, city officials used a $62,500 bribe to induce executives of the Pepperell Manufacturing Co. (now [[WestPoint Home]]) to construct a large mill just outside the city limits.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} From 1930 to 1970, Opelika continued industrialization, becoming a regional economic powerhouse.\n\nIn the 1950s, Opelika attracted the nation's first and largest magnetic tape manufacturing plant. In 1963, tire manufacturer [[Uniroyal]] constructed a massive plant in Opelika. Around the same time, Diversified Products revolutionized the physical fitness equipment industry with products produced in their Opelika plant. By the early 1970s, Opelika's industries employed nearly 10,000 people.\n\nBetween the late 1970s and 2005, nonagricultural employment in the Auburn-Opelika, AL, MSA grew at a slow and steady pace. Of the goods-producing industries, the metropolitan area has experienced the most change in manufacturing, which peaked in employment in the late 1980s. As many jobs moved offshore, employment declined, but this trend appears to be changing, as the number of manufacturing jobs has risen steadily since 2002.\n\nIn the late 1990s, Opelika purchased and developed the Northeast Opelika Industrial Park to increase its base. The {{convert|2200|acre|km2|adj=mid}} park site was purchased with funds from two bond issues, commonly called the 1998A and 1998B issues, totaling $10,280,000. Additional expenditures involved in constructing the Northeast Opelika Industrial Park included $4.3 million transferred from the city's general fund to the Opelika Industrial Development Authority (OIDA) between 1997 and 2000, a $1.9 million federal industrial park access road grant, $2.5 million from Opelika Water Works Board and the City of Opelika to sewer and water the park, $12.1 million from the Alabama Department of Transportation to construct an interchange. Additional expenditures were made by Tallapoosa Electric Cooperative for an electrical substation and by the OIDA for building construction for park tenants. Final expenditures for the land and development of the park totaled about $32 million. Since 1999, two major distribution centers, four tier-one automotive suppliers, Pharmavite, the global leader in the manufacturing and distribution of dietary supplements, and most recently Golden State Foods, one of the biggest service providers to McDonald's restaurants, including liquid products, and its third largest beef supplier in the U.S., have located within the park. The site has also attracted serious interest from automakers [[Audi]], [[Nissan]], and [[Hyundai Motor Group|Hyundai]]. In the summer of 2003, the park was recognized as one of the \"South's Best Automotive Assembly Plant Sites\" by ''Southern Business and Development,'' an industry trade publication.\n\nOpelika has had a related boom in retail development. TigerTown, a {{convert|130|acre|km2|adj=mid}} mixed-use development, is east Alabama's largest retail center with more than {{convert|1000000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} of retail space. Located at the intersection of Interstate 85 and Highway 280 (exit 58) in Opelika and home to more than 70 businesses,  TigerTown's tenants include Home Depot, Target, Best Buy, Starbucks, Olive Garden, Kroger, PETCO, Office Depot, Dick's Sporting Goods, World Market, Hobby Lobby, Kohl's, Bed, Bath and Beyond, T.J. Maxx, Kroger, Old Navy, and more.\n\nOpelika's largest employer is the East Alabama Medical Center, which paid around $119 million in salaries and benefits to more than 2,700 employees in 2009.<ref>[https://www.eamc.org/includes/files/annualreport2009.pdf page 14]</ref>\n\nHistoric downtown Opelika has had an urban design revitalization in association with the national Main Street, Inc. program. With a compact historic district listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]], downtown Opelika has attracted a variety of specialty shops, galleries, antique stores, and restaurants.\n\nWith industrial and retail growth has come an increase in population. From 2000 to 2010, Opelika grew from 23,638 to 26,617.<ref>Opelika population figures as recorded by the US Census Bureau (July 1 estimates base): 2000-23,638, 2001-23,636, 2002-23,579, 2003-23,597, 2004-23,483, 2005-23,804\n.</ref>\n\n[[File:Opelika City Hall Memorial.jpg|thumb|Memorial in front of Opelika City Hall]]\n\n==Law and government==\nOpelika is governed by a [[mayor-council government]], with a mayor and a five-member [[city council]].\n\nThe chief executive official of the city of Opelika is the mayor. The mayor is elected at-large for a four-year term. The mayor has complete executive power in the city, and can appoint and dismiss department heads at will. The current mayor of Opelika is Gary Fuller.\n\nThe Opelika city council is the legislative body of the city. It passes laws and ordinances, and creates citywide policy. The city council is made up of five members, chosen for four-year terms each from one of five districts. Current council members through 2020 are:\n* District 1 - Patricia Jones\n* District 2 - Tiffany Gibson-Pitts\n* District 3 - Dozier Smith T\n* District 4 - Eddie Smith\n* District 5 - David Canon\n\nRecently the city council designated Opelika as a [[City of Character]]. The City of Character program is made to recognize, emphasize and in some cases enforce good character throughout the community as well as mandate character training from [[CharacterFirst!]]. There are 49 character traits emphasized. These traits were designated by [[Bill Gothard]].<ref>[http://www.envisionopelika.org/?p=45 Envision Opelika \u00bb City of Character<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.charactercities.org/aboutus/charactercities/ Character Cities, Counties, and States - International Association of Character Cities<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080118225650/http://www.charactercities.org/aboutus/charactercities/ |date=2008-01-18 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.characterfirst.com/aboutus/#qualities |title=About Us - Character First!<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=2008-01-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071231171401/http://www.characterfirst.com/aboutus/#qualities |archive-date=2007-12-31 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nOpelika is located in north-central [[Lee County, Alabama|Lee County]], and is bordered by [[Auburn, Alabama|Auburn]] to the west. Opelika lies in the southern reaches of the [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont Plateau]], and straddles the divide between the [[Tallapoosa River|Tallapoosa]] and the [[Chattahoochee River|Chattahoochee]] river watersheds.\n\nThe city is located along [[Interstate 85 in Alabama|Interstate 85]], which runs east of the city, with access from exits 58, 60, 62, 64, and 66.\nI-85 leads northeast 101&nbsp;mi (163&nbsp;km) to [[Atlanta]] and southwest 62&nbsp;mi (100&nbsp;km) to [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]]. U.S. Routes [[U.S. Route 280|280]] and [[U.S. Route 431 in Alabama|431]] also run through the city as well, with US 280/431 leading southeast 27&nbsp;mi (43&nbsp;km) to [[Phenix City, Alabama|Phenix City]].

As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], the population of Opelika was 26,401,<ref name=\"Census 2010\"/> and in 2018 the estimated population was 30,555.<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\"/> The [[Auburn, Alabama, metropolitan area|Auburn-Opelika, AL MSA]] with a population of 150,933, along with the [[Columbus, Georgia metropolitan area]], comprises the [[Columbus\u2013Auburn\u2013Opelika, GA\u2013AL CSA|Greater Columbus]] combined statistical area, a region home to 501,649 residents.\n\n[[File:Historic Downtown Marker.jpg|thumb|Opelika's historic downtown]]\n\n==History==\nThe first white settlers in the area now known as Opelika arrived in the late 1830s and established a community called Lebanon. After the removal of the native Creek (Muscogee) peoples by federal troops in 1836\u201337, the area became known as \"Opelika.\" This word taken from the [[Creek language|Muskogee]] language means \"large swamp\".\n\nIn 1848, the Montgomery and West Point Railroad Company extended a rail line from [[Montgomery, Alabama]], to Opelika, and in 1851, completed a connection to [[West Point, Georgia]], thus connecting Opelika with [[Atlanta, Georgia]]. This line was the only direct rail route between [[New Orleans]] and the [[East Coast of the United States|Eastern Seaboard]]. It rapidly became one of the primary trade lines for shipments of raw cotton from [[Southern United States|Southern]] plantations to the North. The Montgomery and West Point was soon joined by a rail connection to [[Columbus, Georgia]], in 1855, and a connection to [[Birmingham, Alabama]], in 1869. Almost overnight, Opelika became a regional hub for commerce.\n\nTo manage this rapid growth, Opelika was incorporated as a town on February 9, 1854, then within [[Russell County, Alabama|Russell County]]. As a result of Opelika's transportation infrastructure, many warehouses for storing cotton and other goods were built. With the onset of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], these warehouses were converted to [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] supply depots. In 1864 and 1865, Union raids commanded by [[Lovell Rousseau]] and [[James H. Wilson]] attacked Opelika, tearing up the railroads and destroying all government property, including Opelika's warehouses.\n\nSoon after the end of the war, the Alabama state legislature created a new county out of parts of [[Macon County, Alabama|Macon]], Russell, [[Chambers County, Alabama|Chambers]], and [[Tallapoosa County, Alabama|Tallapoosa]] Counties to be named after Confederate general [[Robert E. Lee]]. In 1866, citizens of the new \"[[Lee County, Alabama|Lee County]]\" voted Opelika as the county seat. The town was technically unincorporated after having its charter revoked for abetting the rebellion against the United States.\n\nAfter Opelika received a new charter in 1870, rapid growth resumed. The town nearly doubled in size between 1870 and 1900. During this time, Opelika began to gain a reputation as a wild, lawless town.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} Soon after receiving the new charter, city officials attempted to scam outside investors by issuing fake railroad bonds. For this, the town's charter was revoked again in 1872, and the town was administered as a police district by the state legislature for the following year. {{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}\n\nOpelika's downtown was packed with [[bar (establishment)|saloons]] catering to railroad workers and other men. Frequent gunfire in the street by intoxicated patrons resulted in railroads directing their passengers to duck beneath the windows when their trains passed through the town.<ref name=\"nyt\">[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9806E0D6143DE533A25756C1A9649D94639FD7CF \"The Battle Of The Bar-rooms; Murderous Factions Fights In Alabama\u2014Death Of Maloney In Opelika\"], ''New York Times'', 15 December 1882, accessed 4 April 2016.</ref>\n\nIn 1882, two factions claimed to rule the city government, one known as the \"Bar room\" headed by Mayor Dunbar, a saloon keeper, and another known as the \"Citizens\". In a riot in late November\u2013December of that year, a dozen men were wounded. In the end, a few were killed. The Citizens had claimed control of the city via the elections, but Dunbar refused to give up. After continued violence, the state legislature revoked the city's charter and the governor sent in the [[militia]] to restore order. The legislature appointed five commissioners to manage the city,<ref name=\"nyt\"/> a situation that continued until 1899. That year, the legislature restored the city's charter.\n\n===1900 to present===\nIn 1900, local investors founded the Opelika Cotton Mill as the first textile plant in the city, employing 125. The city was located on the [[Atlantic Seaboard fall line|Fall Line]] of the Piedmont, where factories were established to take advantage of water power. Attempts to expand the textile industry in Opelika continued for the next three decades. In 1925, city officials used a $62,500 bribe to induce executives of the Pepperell Manufacturing Co. (now [[WestPoint Home]]) to construct a large mill just outside the city limits.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} From 1930 to 1970, Opelika continued industrialization, becoming a regional economic powerhouse.\n\nIn the 1950s, Opelika attracted the nation's first and largest magnetic tape manufacturing plant. In 1963, tire manufacturer [[Uniroyal]] constructed a massive plant in Opelika. Around the same time, Diversified Products revolutionized the physical fitness equipment industry with products produced in their Opelika plant. By the early 1970s, Opelika's industries employed nearly 10,000 people.\n\nBetween the late 1970s and 2005, nonagricultural employment in the Auburn-Opelika, AL, MSA grew at a slow and steady pace. Of the goods-producing industries, the metropolitan area has experienced the most change in manufacturing, which peaked in employment in the late 1980s. As many jobs moved offshore, employment declined, but this trend appears to be changing, as the number of manufacturing jobs has risen steadily since 2002.\n\nIn the late 1990s, Opelika purchased and developed the Northeast Opelika Industrial Park to increase its base. The {{convert|2200|acre|km2|adj=mid}} park site was purchased with funds from two bond issues, commonly called the 1998A and 1998B issues, totaling $10,280,000. Additional expenditures involved in constructing the Northeast Opelika Industrial Park included $4.3 million transferred from the city's general fund to the Opelika Industrial Development Authority (OIDA) between 1997 and 2000, a $1.9 million federal industrial park access road grant, $2.5 million from Opelika Water Works Board and the City of Opelika to sewer and water the park, $12.1 million from the Alabama Department of Transportation to construct an interchange. Additional expenditures were made by Tallapoosa Electric Cooperative for an electrical substation and by the OIDA for building construction for park tenants. Final expenditures for the land and development of the park totaled about $32 million. Since 1999, two major distribution centers, four tier-one automotive suppliers, Pharmavite, the global leader in the manufacturing and distribution of dietary supplements, and most recently Golden State Foods, one of the biggest service providers to McDonald's restaurants, including liquid products, and its third largest beef supplier in the U.S., have located within the park. The site has also attracted serious interest from automakers [[Audi]], [[Nissan]], and [[Hyundai Motor Group|Hyundai]]. In the summer of 2003, the park was recognized as one of the \"South's Best Automotive Assembly Plant Sites\" by ''Southern Business and Development,'' an industry trade publication.\n\nOpelika has had a related boom in retail development. TigerTown, a {{convert|130|acre|km2|adj=mid}} mixed-use development, is east Alabama's largest retail center with more than {{convert|1000000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} of retail space. Located at the intersection of Interstate 85 and Highway 280 (exit 58) in Opelika and home to more than 70 businesses,  TigerTown's tenants include Home Depot, Target, Best Buy, Starbucks, Olive Garden, Kroger, PETCO, Office Depot, Dick's Sporting Goods, World Market, Hobby Lobby, Kohl's, Bed, Bath and Beyond, T.J. Maxx, Kroger, Old Navy, and more.\n\nOpelika's largest employer is the East Alabama Medical Center, which paid around $119 million in salaries and benefits to more than 2,700 employees in 2009.<ref>[https://www.eamc.org/includes/files/annualreport2009.pdf page 14]</ref>\n\nHistoric downtown Opelika has had an urban design revitalization in association with the national Main Street, Inc. program. With a compact historic district listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]], downtown Opelika has attracted a variety of specialty shops, galleries, antique stores, and restaurants.\n\nWith industrial and retail growth has come an increase in population. From 2000 to 2010, Opelika grew from 23,638 to 26,617.<ref>Opelika population figures as recorded by the US Census Bureau (July 1 estimates base): 2000-23,638, 2001-23,636, 2002-23,579, 2003-23,597, 2004-23,483, 2005-23,804\n.</ref>\n\n[[File:Opelika City Hall Memorial.jpg|thumb|Memorial in front of Opelika City Hall]]\n\n==Law and government==\nOpelika is governed by a [[mayor-council government]], with a mayor and a five-member [[city council]].\n\nThe chief executive official of the city of Opelika is the mayor. The mayor is elected at-large for a four-year term. The mayor has complete executive power in the city, and can appoint and dismiss department heads at will. The current mayor of Opelika is Gary Fuller.\n\nThe Opelika city council is the legislative body of the city. It passes laws and ordinances, and creates citywide policy. The city council is made up of five members, chosen for four-year terms each from one of five districts. Current council members through 2020 are:\n* District 1 - Patricia Jones\n* District 2 - Tiffany Gibson-Pitts\n* District 3 - Dozier Smith T\n* District 4 - Eddie Smith\n* District 5 - David Canon\n\nRecently the city council designated Opelika as a [[City of Character]]. The City of Character program is made to recognize, emphasize and in some cases enforce good character throughout the community as well as mandate character training from [[CharacterFirst!]]. There are 49 character traits emphasized. These traits were designated by [[Bill Gothard]].<ref>[http://www.envisionopelika.org/?p=45 Envision Opelika \u00bb City of Character<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.charactercities.org/aboutus/charactercities/ Character Cities, Counties, and States - International Association of Character Cities<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080118225650/http://www.charactercities.org/aboutus/charactercities/ |date=2008-01-18 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.characterfirst.com/aboutus/#qualities |title=About Us - Character First!<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=2008-01-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071231171401/http://www.characterfirst.com/aboutus/#qualities |archive-date=2007-12-31 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nOpelika is located in north-central [[Lee County, Alabama|Lee County]], and is bordered by [[Auburn, Alabama|Auburn]] to the west. Opelika lies in the southern reaches of the [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont Plateau]], and straddles the divide between the [[Tallapoosa River|Tallapoosa]] and the [[Chattahoochee River|Chattahoochee]] river watersheds.\n\nThe city is located along [[Interstate 85 in Alabama|Interstate 85]], which runs east of the city, with access from exits 58, 60, 62, 64, and 66.\nI-85 leads northeast 101&nbsp;mi (163&nbsp;km) to [[Atlanta]] and southwest 62&nbsp;mi (100&nbsp;km) to [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]]. U.S. Routes [[U.S. Route 280|280]] and [[U.S. Route 431 in Alabama|431]] also run through the city as well, with US 280/431 leading southeast 27&nbsp;mi (43&nbsp;km) to [[Phenix City, Alabama|Phenix City]]. After splitting in the city, US 280 leads northwest 28&nbsp;mi (45&nbsp;km) to [[Dadeville, Alabama|Dadeville]], and US 431 leads north 23&nbsp;mi (37&nbsp;km) to [[LaFayette, Alabama|LaFayette]].\n\nAccording to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|53.4|sqmi|km2}}, of which {{convert|52.8|sqmi|km2}} is land and {{convert|0.7|sqmi|km2}} (1.24%) is water.\n\n==Economy==\nOpelika is located between the Hyundai-Kia automobile manufacturing facilities with the [[Kia Motors]] manufacturing plant about {{convert|18|mi|km}} east on I-85 and the [[Hyundai Motor Manufacturing Alabama|Hyundai Motors]] manufacturing plant about {{convert|67|mi|km}} west on I-85/I-65.\n\nOpelika's economy has shifted away from a traditional basis in [[textile manufacturing]]. Since 2004, the city has experienced revitalization in many segments of the economy, including commercial, residential and industrial activity. Since January 2005, the City of Opelika has announced new industry investments and existing industry expansions totaling 1.407 billion and 3717 additional jobs.<ref>http://www.opelikaeconomicdevelopment.org</ref>\nProjects include a {{convert|170000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} company named [[Daewon]]. Daewon's investment in Opelika totaled $52.5 million, but a $13 million expansion in 2012 brought their total investment in Opelika to $65.5 million. Along with the additional investment of $13 million, they added 32 more jobs, bringing their total number of jobs to 240. As of June 2019, Daewon has invested a total of $108.5 million and the total number of jobs created to 273.\n\n[[File:Northeast Opelika Industrial Park.jpg|thumb|Northeast Opelika Industrial Park]]\n\nAnother major employer is Baxter International Inc.'s plant in Opelika. Previously known as Gambro Renal Products, the Swedish-based manufacturer of dialyzers for kidney dialysis made the largest single initial investment in Lee County's history of $165.5 million in 2005. The company changed its name to Baxter after merging with Baxter International, Inc., an Illinois-based company that manufactures life-sustaining medical products including dialyzers, which act as filters for patients with end stage renal disease. In August 2014, Baxter announced plans for a $300 million expansion of its state-of-the-art facility in Opelika, that added {{convert|230000|sqft|m2}} and several production lines, and created an additional 200 jobs. As of June 2019, Baxter has a total capital investment of $465.5 million and total job creation is 360.\n\nMando America Corp. has also been very successful in Opelika and continues to grow and prosper. An expansion announcement in April 2012 of approximately $24 million brought Mando's total investment in Opelika to nearly $160 million. Along with the $24 million investment, Mando promised 30 more jobs, increasing the total number of employees to over 600 and making them one of the largest employers in Opelika. In June 2013, Mando announced an additional investment of $35 million for equipment and building improvements over the next three years with plans to hire an additional 67 employees to support the expansion.

With a pair of tunnels under the Wellington hills, the deviation alleviated issues with more and heavier freight traffic on the steep and twisting original route where long sections at 1 in 60 gradient required banker engines. The Wellington to Johnsonville section of the original line was retained as the [[Johnsonville Line]] and the Johnsonville to Tawa section closed.\n\nThe sections from Plimmerton to South Junction, north of Pukerua Bay and Muri, and North Junction to Paekakariki were duplicated in 1940. From 24 July 1940 electrification at 1500 V DC of the southern section of the NIMT from Wellington to Paekakariki was completed.  The [[Tawa Flat deviation]] has a long tunnel (Tawa No 2)  not suitable for steam operation because of excessive smoke (although steam trains were temporarily operated in the new deviation from 1935). A Centralised Train Control (CTC) system was installed in 1940, so that new signal boxes were not required and five stations between Tawa and Pukerua Bay no longer had to be continually staffed for Tablet operation; see [[Kapiti Line#Duplication|Kapiti Line]]. Electrification eliminated the need to relieve the steep (1 in 57) gradients from Plimmerton to the Pukerua Bay summit by a deviation to the east and allowed more frequent suburban passenger trains (and allowed suburban electric multiple units to run on this section from September 1949).\n[[File:Electric Locomotives Near Paekakariki.jpg|thumb|[[New Zealand EW class locomotive|EW]]1805 hauling [[New Zealand DC class locomotive|DC]] 4611 near Paekakariki on the electrified Wellington section.

Some tunnels were opened out or bypassed by deviations while in others clearances were increased, and curves eased. The section between [[Ohakune]] and Horopito was realigned with three viaducts replaced to handle higher loads and speeds. The most notable bridge replaced was the curved metal viaduct at Hapuawhenua by a modern concrete structure, though the original has been restored as a tourist attraction.\n\nIn 2009\u201310, the 1.5&nbsp;km section of line between Wellington Junction and Distant Junction was rebuilt from double track to triple track, to ease peak-time congestion.\n\nIn February 2011 duplication between Paekakariki and Waikanae was completed as part of the upgrade and expansion of the Wellington suburban network; see [[Kapiti Line]] for more information.\n\nIn 2012\u201313 four bridges near Rangiriri between Auckland and Hamilton were replaced.

Wellington's urban network is electrified at ([[1500 V DC railway electrification|1500 V DC]]); as formerly used in other sections of the New Zealand  network. In Wellington the operating voltage has been increased to 1700 V DC since the full introduction of the [[New Zealand FP class electric multiple unit|Matangi EMU]], to increase the power available.  \n \nElectrification of the NIMT was mooted by electrical engineer [[Evan Parry]] in the first volume of the ''New Zealand Journal of Science and Technology'' in November 1918. In light of a national coal shortage following [[World War I]], Parry argued that the network was under great strain due to ever-increasing volumes of freight, and the use of steam traction was partly to blame. Parry also noted that there was great potential for cheap hydro-electricity generation in the central North Island to power electrification.\n\nThe first part of the NIMT to be electrified was the [[Wellington]]\u2013[[Paekakariki railway station|Paekakariki]] section via the [[Tawa Flat deviation]] that was completed on 24 July 1940. This was largely to prevent smoke nuisance in the 4.3&nbsp;km No. 2 tunnel, and to provide for banking on the Paekakariki to Pukerua Bay section. Electric traction in this section is now used only by [[Transdev Wellington]] for Metlink suburban passenger services on the [[Kapiti Line]], and was extended to [[Paraparaumu railway station|Paraparaumu]] on 7 May 1983 and [[Waikanae railway station|Waikanae]] on 20 February 2011. Funded by the [[Greater Wellington Regional Council]], the extension to Waikanae coincided with the delivery of new [[New Zealand FP class electric multiple unit|FP class Matangi]] [[electric multiple unit]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kiwirail.co.nz/index.php?page=wellington-projects|title=KiwiRail \u2013 Wellington Projects|date=22 September 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722185555/http://www.kiwirail.co.nz/index.php?page=wellington-projects|archivedate=22 July 2011}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the Second World War railway services suffered due to skill and coal shortages. Skilled staff sought employment opportunities elsewhere in the economy. From 1948 to 1951 the General Manager of the Railways Department, Francis William Aickin, advocated electrification of the entire line, despite protests from his engineering staff. Aickin had previously been Staff Superintendent and Chief Legal Advisor to the Department, and considered using diesel locomotives for trains on the NIMT to be too expensive. He turned his attention to electrification, mainly because he saw that it could relieve the coal situation and prevent high expenditure on imported fuels.\n\nHe commissioned a study into electrification, which concluded that a low-frequency AC system could be cheaper than 1500 V DC, the system in use in Wellington. Aickin sent a technical mission of four senior officers overseas in March 1949 and travelled overseas himself to negotiate a tentative contract with a British construction company. The Chief Mechanical Engineer and Chief Accountant specified and costed the system and Aickin was able to complete a substantial report justifying the NIMT electrification and submit it to the Government.\n\nOfficers from [[New Zealand Treasury]] and the [[New Zealand Ministry of Works|Ministry of Works]] and two experts from [[Sweden]] (Thelander and Edenius) commented on the proposal and in December 1950 the Government granted approval in principle and agreed to appoint Thelander as a consultant. However, Aickin fell out with the then National Government and retired as General Manager in July 1951. With the change in regime, the electrification proposal disappeared.\n\nA key assumption of Aickin's report was that traffic on the NIMT would grow by 50% from 1948 to 1961. Since a diesel-electric locomotive was in fact a travelling power station, the savings through electrification compared to diesel could be regarded as the difference between the cost of buying bulk electrical energy generated substantially from New Zealand resources and the cost of generating electricity in a small plant using imported diesel fuel.\n\nHowever, the Royal Commission on Railways created following Aickin's tenure rejected the report's findings. Aickin's successor, H.C. Lusty, revised the tentative contract with [[English Electric]] to specify [[NZR DF class (1954)|DF]] diesel-electric locomotives. They were later found to be unreliable, and only ten were supplied. 42 [[New Zealand DG and DH class locomotive|DG]] locomotives were supplied instead for secondary lines. For main lines including the NIMT, [[New Zealand DA class locomotive|D<sup>A</sup> class]] diesel-electric locomotives were ordered from General Motors.\n\nThe {{convert|411|km|mi|abbr=on}} section between [[Palmerston North]] and [[Hamilton, New Zealand|Hamilton]] was electrified at 25 kV 50&nbsp;Hz [[alternating current|AC]], opened on 24 June 1988<ref name=\"nzro_winter_1988\">{{cite journal|journal=New Zealand Railway Observer|title=North Island Main Trunk Electrified|date=Autumn 1988|publisher=[[New Zealand Railway and Locomotive Society]]|issn=0028-8624|volume=45| issue =  1|page=49|author=Tom McGavin}}</ref> as one of the [[Robert Muldoon|Muldoon]] [[Third National Government of New Zealand|National Government's]] \"[[Think Big]]\" energy development projects. An overall cost in excess of $100 million had been projected, with some 40% being for the locomotives, but the final cost was about $250 million. The economics of the project was greatly undermined by the fall of the price of oil in the 1980s and the deregulation of land transport, which removed the long-distance monopoly NZR held when the cost-benefit report was written.\n[[File:EF30163+Overlander NearWaiouru 22March2003 JChristianson.jpg|thumb|[[New Zealand EF class locomotive|EF]]30163 hauling The [[Overlander (train)|Overlander]] on the [[25 kV AC railway electrification|25 kV AC]] [[Railway electrification system|electrified]] section in 2003.]]\nThe electrification of the section, which had its genesis in a study group set up in June 1974 to report on measures to be taken to cope with increasing rail traffic volumes, received approval in 1980. This led to a technical study carried out with assistance from the Japanese [[Railway Technical Research Institute]]. The report stated that track capacity would be increased by electrification because such traction is faster and able to move more freight at once. The report stated, for example, that whereas a diesel locomotive could haul 720-tonne trains at {{convert|27|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} up the [[Raurimu Spiral]], an electric locomotive could haul 1100/1200-tonne trains at {{convert|45|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}}, cutting 3\u20135 hours off journey times. Less fuel would be needed and employing regenerative braking in electric locomotives lowers the fuel consumption further.\n\nElectrification's advantages were reflected in the economic evaluation in the report, which showed a rate of return of 18%. Sensitivity analysis showed that this high rate of return gave the project robustness against lower traffic volumes than expected (the return remained positive even if traffic fell), against significant increases in construction cost, and against lower than expected rises in the diesel fuel price.\n\nPart of the project included replacing the copper wire communications system with a new [[fiber optic|fibre optic]] communications cable (due to interference caused by AC power with the DC copper wire system) between Wellington and Auckland. In 1994 New Zealand Rail Limited sold the cable to [[Clear Communications]] for telephone traffic, leasing part of it back for signalling.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://canterbury.cyberplace.org.nz/community/CAFCA/cafca94/sept94.html|title=September 1994&nbsp;decisions|publisher=[[Campaign Against Foreign Control of Aotearoa]]}}</ref>\n\nProposals to [[Auckland railway electrification|electrify the Auckland suburban rail network]] dated back to the 1960s,{{sfn|Churchman & Hurst|2001|p=30}} they mainly coincided with proposals to electrify the NIMT in its entirety.

In 1932 the [[4-8-4]] [[NZR K class (1932)|K class]] was introduced, and later improved in 1939 with the [[NZR Ka class|K<sup>A</sup>]].\n\nThe introduction of the English Electric [[NZR DF class (1954)|D<sup>F</sup> class]] in 1954 began the end of the steam era, and in 1955 with the introduction of the [[New Zealand DA class locomotive|D<sup>A</sup>]] major withdrawals of steam locomotives began. 1972 saw the introduction of [[New Zealand DX class locomotive|D<sup>X</sup>]] locomotives and the [[NZR RM class (Silver Fern)|Silver Fern]] railcars: the latter remained in service between Auckland and Wellington until 1991.\n\nWith electrification and the introduction of the [[New Zealand EF class locomotive|EF class]] electric locomotives in the late 1980s, the DX class was mainly reassigned to other areas of the network, including hauling coal on the [[Midland Line, New Zealand|Midland Line]] in the [[South Island]]. Since then services between Te Rapa and Palmerston North have been worked mainly by the electrics, although some services are still diesel operated, such as those originating from or terminating on other lines, or originating from within the central section, like the paper pulp freight trains from Karioi.\n\nAs of May 2016, regular rolling stock on the NIMT include:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#f9f9f9;\"\n!

The daily \"Express\" left earlier in the evening, followed by the \"Limited\", which had fewer stops for passengers.\n\nBetween 1963 and 1968 daytime trains were called the [[Scenic Daylight]]. In 1968, an [[NZR RM class|RM class]] [[NZR RM class (88 seater)|88-seater]] [[railcar]] was refurbished and repainted in a distinctive blue scheme that led to it being nicknamed the Blue Streak. It initially operated an unsuccessful service between [[Hamilton, New Zealand|Hamilton]] and Auckland in early 1968, and was transferred to the Auckland-Wellington run on 23 September 1968.\n[[File:Tolldc4093.jpg|thumb|A [[New Zealand DC class locomotive|DC]] hauls the now replaced [[Overlander (train)|Overlander]] long-distance passenger train between Auckland and Wellington.]]\nIn 1971 [[New Zealand Railways Department|NZR]] introduced the [[Silver Star (NZR train)|Silver Star]], a luxury sleeper train. The service was not economically viable, and was withdrawn in 1979. Much more successful was the [[NZR RM class (Silver Fern)|Silver Fern]], a daytime [[railcar]] service, introduced in 1972 to replace the \"Blue Streak\". This service was withdrawn in 1991 and replaced by [[Overlander (train)|The Overlander]].\n\nIn conjunction with the introduction of the carriage train Overlander service, the Silver Fern railcars were redeployed to start new services between Tauranga and Auckland \u2013 [[Kaimai Express]], and Auckland and Rotorua \u2013 [[Geyserland Express]], in 1991. In 2000 a new commuter service called the [[Waikato Connection]] was introduced between Hamilton and Auckland and ran in conjunction with the services to Tauranga and Rotorua until all three services were cancelled in 2001.\n\nOn 25 July 2006 Toll announced that the Overlander would cease at the end of September 2006, but on 28 September 2006 the train's continuation on a limited timetable was announced.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/story.cfm?c_id=1&ObjectID=10403445| title=Overlander to continue running| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] | date=28 September 2006| accessdate=15 October 2007}}</ref> It ran daily during the summer months and thrice-weekly for the balance of the year.\n\nIn 2012 KiwiRail announced the Overlander would be replaced by the [[Northern Explorer]], with new [[New Zealand AK class carriage|AK class carriages]] to provide a premium tourist train on a quicker timetable with fewer stops. It commenced on Monday 25 June 2012, and consists of one train running from Auckland to Wellington on Mondays, Thursdays and Saturdays, and Wellington to Auckland on Wednesdays, Fridays and Sundays. It has fewer stops than the Overlander, stopping only at Papakura, Hamilton, [[Otorohanga]], National Park, Ohakune, Palmerston North and Paraparaumu.\n\nThe [[Capital Connection (train)|Capital Connection]] commuter train operates between [[Palmerston North]] and Wellington.\n\nBoth KiwiRail and private enthusiast operators such as the Railway Enthusiasts Society, Mainline Steam and Steam Inc operate charter trains.\n\n===Auckland suburban===\n[[File:Britomart Outside Facade.jpg|thumb|The northern terminus of the NIMT, [[Britomart Transport Centre]].]]\n{{main|Public transport in Auckland|Auckland railway electrification}}\nSuburban trains run on the NIMT at regular intervals as follows:\n\n[[Eastern Line, Auckland|Eastern Line]] (Manukau to Britomart via Glen Innes) trains run on the NIMT between Puhinui and Britomart.\n\n[[Southern Line, Auckland|Southern Line]] (Papakura to Britomart via Otahuhu and Newmarket) trains run on the NIMT from Papakura to [[Westfield Junction]]. They then run on the [[North Auckland Line]] to Newmarket, and the [[Newmarket Line]] to the vicinity of [[Quay Park]], where they rejoin the NIMT only for the short section (about 500 metres) into Britomart. A diesel train shuttle service runs on the NIMT between Pukekohe and Papakura.\n\n[[Onehunga Line]] and [[Western Line, Auckland|Western Line]] trains use the NIMT only for the short section (about 500 metres) from the vicinity of Quay Park into Britomart.\n\n===Wellington suburban===\n[[File:Wellington Railway Station by night.

The [[Tawa Flat deviation]] has a long tunnel (Tawa No 2)  not suitable for steam operation because of excessive smoke (although steam trains were temporarily operated in the new deviation from 1935). A Centralised Train Control (CTC) system was installed in 1940, so that new signal boxes were not required and five stations between Tawa and Pukerua Bay no longer had to be continually staffed for Tablet operation; see [[Kapiti Line#Duplication|Kapiti Line]]. Electrification eliminated the need to relieve the steep (1 in 57) gradients from Plimmerton to the Pukerua Bay summit by a deviation to the east and allowed more frequent suburban passenger trains (and allowed suburban electric multiple units to run on this section from September 1949).\n[[File:Electric Locomotives Near Paekakariki.jpg|thumb|[[New Zealand EW class locomotive|EW]]1805 hauling [[New Zealand DC class locomotive|DC]] 4611 near Paekakariki on the electrified Wellington section.

Wellington's urban network is electrified at ([[1500 V DC railway electrification|1500 V DC]]); as formerly used in other sections of the New Zealand  network. In Wellington the operating voltage has been increased to 1700 V DC since the full introduction of the [[New Zealand FP class electric multiple unit|Matangi EMU]], to increase the power available.  \n \nElectrification of the NIMT was mooted by electrical engineer [[Evan Parry]] in the first volume of the ''New Zealand Journal of Science and Technology'' in November 1918. In light of a national coal shortage following [[World War I]], Parry argued that the network was under great strain due to ever-increasing volumes of freight, and the use of steam traction was partly to blame. Parry also noted that there was great potential for cheap hydro-electricity generation in the central North Island to power electrification.\n\nThe first part of the NIMT to be electrified was the [[Wellington]]\u2013[[Paekakariki railway station|Paekakariki]] section via the [[Tawa Flat deviation]] that was completed on 24 July 1940. This was largely to prevent smoke nuisance in the 4.3&nbsp;km No. 2 tunnel, and to provide for banking on the Paekakariki to Pukerua Bay section. Electric traction in this section is now used only by [[Transdev Wellington]] for Metlink suburban passenger services on the [[Kapiti Line]], and was extended to [[Paraparaumu railway station|Paraparaumu]] on 7 May 1983 and [[Waikanae railway station|Waikanae]] on 20 February 2011. Funded by the [[Greater Wellington Regional Council]], the extension to Waikanae coincided with the delivery of new [[New Zealand FP class electric multiple unit|FP class Matangi]] [[electric multiple unit]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kiwirail.co.nz/index.php?page=wellington-projects|title=KiwiRail \u2013 Wellington Projects|date=22 September 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722185555/http://www.kiwirail.co.nz/index.php?page=wellington-projects|archivedate=22 July 2011}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the Second World War railway services suffered due to skill and coal shortages. Skilled staff sought employment opportunities elsewhere in the economy. From 1948 to 1951 the General Manager of the Railways Department, Francis William Aickin, advocated electrification of the entire line, despite protests from his engineering staff. Aickin had previously been Staff Superintendent and Chief Legal Advisor to the Department, and considered using diesel locomotives for trains on the NIMT to be too expensive. He turned his attention to electrification, mainly because he saw that it could relieve the coal situation and prevent high expenditure on imported fuels.\n\nHe commissioned a study into electrification, which concluded that a low-frequency AC system could be cheaper than 1500 V DC, the system in use in Wellington. Aickin sent a technical mission of four senior officers overseas in March 1949 and travelled overseas himself to negotiate a tentative contract with a British construction company. The Chief Mechanical Engineer and Chief Accountant specified and costed the system and Aickin was able to complete a substantial report justifying the NIMT electrification and submit it to the Government.\n\nOfficers from [[New Zealand Treasury]] and the [[New Zealand Ministry of Works|Ministry of Works]] and two experts from [[Sweden]] (Thelander and Edenius) commented on the proposal and in December 1950 the Government granted approval in principle and agreed to appoint Thelander as a consultant. However, Aickin fell out with the then National Government and retired as General Manager in July 1951. With the change in regime, the electrification proposal disappeared.\n\nA key assumption of Aickin's report was that traffic on the NIMT would grow by 50% from 1948 to 1961. Since a diesel-electric locomotive was in fact a travelling power station, the savings through electrification compared to diesel could be regarded as the difference between the cost of buying bulk electrical energy generated substantially from New Zealand resources and the cost of generating electricity in a small plant using imported diesel fuel.\n\nHowever, the Royal Commission on Railways created following Aickin's tenure rejected the report's findings. Aickin's successor, H.C. Lusty, revised the tentative contract with [[English Electric]] to specify [[NZR DF class (1954)|DF]] diesel-electric locomotives. They were later found to be unreliable, and only ten were supplied. 42 [[New Zealand DG and DH class locomotive|DG]] locomotives were supplied instead for secondary lines. For main lines including the NIMT, [[New Zealand DA class locomotive|D<sup>A</sup> class]] diesel-electric locomotives were ordered from General Motors.\n\nThe {{convert|411|km|mi|abbr=on}} section between [[Palmerston North]] and [[Hamilton, New Zealand|Hamilton]] was electrified at 25 kV 50&nbsp;Hz [[alternating current|AC]], opened on 24 June 1988<ref name=\"nzro_winter_1988\">{{cite journal|journal=New Zealand Railway Observer|title=North Island Main Trunk Electrified|date=Autumn 1988|publisher=[[New Zealand Railway and Locomotive Society]]|issn=0028-8624|volume=45| issue =  1|page=49|author=Tom McGavin}}</ref> as one of the [[Robert Muldoon|Muldoon]] [[Third National Government of New Zealand|National Government's]] \"[[Think Big]]\" energy development projects. An overall cost in excess of $100 million had been projected, with some 40% being for the locomotives, but the final cost was about $250 million. The economics of the project was greatly undermined by the fall of the price of oil in the 1980s and the deregulation of land transport, which removed the long-distance monopoly NZR held when the cost-benefit report was written.\n[[File:EF30163+Overlander NearWaiouru 22March2003 JChristianson.jpg|thumb|[[New Zealand EF class locomotive|EF]]30163 hauling The [[Overlander (train)|Overlander]] on the [[25 kV AC railway electrification|25 kV AC]] [[Railway electrification system|electrified]] section in 2003.]]\nThe electrification of the section, which had its genesis in a study group set up in June 1974 to report on measures to be taken to cope with increasing rail traffic volumes, received approval in 1980. This led to a technical study carried out with assistance from the Japanese [[Railway Technical Research Institute]]. The report stated that track capacity would be increased by electrification because such traction is faster and able to move more freight at once. The report stated, for example, that whereas a diesel locomotive could haul 720-tonne trains at {{convert|27|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} up the [[Raurimu Spiral]], an electric locomotive could haul 1100/1200-tonne trains at {{convert|45|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}}, cutting 3\u20135 hours off journey times. Less fuel would be needed and employing regenerative braking in electric locomotives lowers the fuel consumption further.\n\nElectrification's advantages were reflected in the economic evaluation in the report, which showed a rate of return of 18%. Sensitivity analysis showed that this high rate of return gave the project robustness against lower traffic volumes than expected (the return remained positive even if traffic fell), against significant increases in construction cost, and against lower than expected rises in the diesel fuel price.\n\nPart of the project included replacing the copper wire communications system with a new [[fiber optic|fibre optic]] communications cable (due to interference caused by AC power with the DC copper wire system) between Wellington and Auckland. In 1994 New Zealand Rail Limited sold the cable to [[Clear Communications]] for telephone traffic, leasing part of it back for signalling.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://canterbury.cyberplace.org.nz/community/CAFCA/cafca94/sept94.html|title=September 1994&nbsp;decisions|publisher=[[Campaign Against Foreign Control of Aotearoa]]}}</ref>\n\nProposals to [[Auckland railway electrification|electrify the Auckland suburban rail network]] dated back to the 1960s,{{sfn|Churchman & Hurst|2001|p=30}} they mainly coincided with proposals to electrify the NIMT in its entirety.

In 1932 the [[4-8-4]] [[NZR K class (1932)|K class]] was introduced, and later improved in 1939 with the [[NZR Ka class|K<sup>A</sup>]].\n\nThe introduction of the English Electric [[NZR DF class (1954)|D<sup>F</sup> class]] in 1954 began the end of the steam era, and in 1955 with the introduction of the [[New Zealand DA class locomotive|D<sup>A</sup>]] major withdrawals of steam locomotives began. 1972 saw the introduction of [[New Zealand DX class locomotive|D<sup>X</sup>]] locomotives and the [[NZR RM class (Silver Fern)|Silver Fern]] railcars: the latter remained in service between Auckland and Wellington until 1991.\n\nWith electrification and the introduction of the [[New Zealand EF class locomotive|EF class]] electric locomotives in the late 1980s, the DX class was mainly reassigned to other areas of the network, including hauling coal on the [[Midland Line, New Zealand|Midland Line]] in the [[South Island]]. Since then services between Te Rapa and Palmerston North have been worked mainly by the electrics, although some services are still diesel operated, such as those originating from or terminating on other lines, or originating from within the central section, like the paper pulp freight trains from Karioi.\n\nAs of May 2016, regular rolling stock on the NIMT include:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#f9f9f9;\"\n!

The daily \"Express\" left earlier in the evening, followed by the \"Limited\", which had fewer stops for passengers.\n\nBetween 1963 and 1968 daytime trains were called the [[Scenic Daylight]]. In 1968, an [[NZR RM class|RM class]] [[NZR RM class (88 seater)|88-seater]] [[railcar]] was refurbished and repainted in a distinctive blue scheme that led to it being nicknamed the Blue Streak. It initially operated an unsuccessful service between [[Hamilton, New Zealand|Hamilton]] and Auckland in early 1968, and was transferred to the Auckland-Wellington run on 23 September 1968.\n[[File:Tolldc4093.jpg|thumb|A [[New Zealand DC class locomotive|DC]] hauls the now replaced [[Overlander (train)|Overlander]] long-distance passenger train between Auckland and Wellington.]]\nIn 1971 [[New Zealand Railways Department|NZR]] introduced the [[Silver Star (NZR train)|Silver Star]], a luxury sleeper train. The service was not economically viable, and was withdrawn in 1979. Much more successful was the [[NZR RM class (Silver Fern)|Silver Fern]], a daytime [[railcar]] service, introduced in 1972 to replace the \"Blue Streak\". This service was withdrawn in 1991 and replaced by [[Overlander (train)|The Overlander]].\n\nIn conjunction with the introduction of the carriage train Overlander service, the Silver Fern railcars were redeployed to start new services between Tauranga and Auckland \u2013 [[Kaimai Express]], and Auckland and Rotorua \u2013 [[Geyserland Express]], in 1991. In 2000 a new commuter service called the [[Waikato Connection]] was introduced between Hamilton and Auckland and ran in conjunction with the services to Tauranga and Rotorua until all three services were cancelled in 2001.\n\nOn 25 July 2006 Toll announced that the Overlander would cease at the end of September 2006, but on 28 September 2006 the train's continuation on a limited timetable was announced.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/story.cfm?c_id=1&ObjectID=10403445| title=Overlander to continue running| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] | date=28 September 2006| accessdate=15 October 2007}}</ref> It ran daily during the summer months and thrice-weekly for the balance of the year.\n\nIn 2012 KiwiRail announced the Overlander would be replaced by the [[Northern Explorer]], with new [[New Zealand AK class carriage|AK class carriages]] to provide a premium tourist train on a quicker timetable with fewer stops.

It has fewer stops than the Overlander, stopping only at Papakura, Hamilton, [[Otorohanga]], National Park, Ohakune, Palmerston North and Paraparaumu.\n\nThe [[Capital Connection (train)|Capital Connection]] commuter train operates between [[Palmerston North]] and Wellington.\n\nBoth KiwiRail and private enthusiast operators such as the Railway Enthusiasts Society, Mainline Steam and Steam Inc operate charter trains.\n\n===Auckland suburban===\n[[File:Britomart Outside Facade.jpg|thumb|The northern terminus of the NIMT, [[Britomart Transport Centre]].]]\n{{main|Public transport in Auckland|Auckland railway electrification}}\nSuburban trains run on the NIMT at regular intervals as follows:\n\n[[Eastern Line, Auckland|Eastern Line]] (Manukau to Britomart via Glen Innes) trains run on the NIMT between Puhinui and Britomart.\n\n[[Southern Line, Auckland|Southern Line]] (Papakura to Britomart via Otahuhu and Newmarket) trains run on the NIMT from Papakura to [[Westfield Junction]]. They then run on the [[North Auckland Line]] to Newmarket, and the [[Newmarket Line]] to the vicinity of [[Quay Park]], where they rejoin the NIMT only for the short section (about 500 metres) into Britomart. A diesel train shuttle service runs on the NIMT between Pukekohe and Papakura.\n\n[[Onehunga Line]] and [[Western Line, Auckland|Western Line]] trains use the NIMT only for the short section (about 500 metres) from the vicinity of Quay Park into Britomart.\n\n===Wellington suburban===\n[[File:Wellington Railway Station by night.

Even so, Seabees always bring their toolbox.  One of those tools is the ingenuity Admiral King referenced.  They gained fame for their application of it during WWII.  The UDTs and flamethrowing tanks are declassified top secret examples. Post war they followed with more of the same for the CIA and State Department. Together with their USMC training and ability to appropriate anything, they provide the Navy an unconventional asset found nowhere else in the U.S military.\n\n== Naval construction history ==\n\n'''CB Conceptual Formation'''\n\nIn the early 1930s, the idea of the 1917 Twelfth Regiment was still remembered by the Navy's Civil Engineers.

[[Richmond K. Turner|Kelly Turner]], commander V Amphibious Corps had ordered a review to get a grip on the problem.  VAC found that the only people having any applicable experience with the material were men in the Naval Construction Battalions.  Lt. Thomas C. Crist (CB 10) was in Pearl Harbor from [[Canton Island]]<ref>Lt Crist, \"The MOCK-UP\", Fort Pierce ATB Newspaper, 20 July 1945 , p. 4, Fort Pierce SEAL Archives, Fort Pierce,  FL</ref><ref>UDTs 1 & 2, The Marshall Islands, Kwajalein, Roi-Namur, Eniwetok, U.

His being in Pearl Harbor was pivotal in [[Underwater Demolition Team|UDT]] history.  While there he learned of the Adm. Turner's interest in coral blasting and made contact.  The Admiral tasked Lt. Crist to develop a method for blasting coral under combat conditions and putting together a team to do it.<ref name=\"UDT Cold\"/>  Lt. Crist started by getting men from CB 10.  By December 1, 1943 he had close to 30 officers and 150 enlisted at [[Waipio]] Amphibious Operating Base on Oahu.<ref name=\"UDT Cold\"/>\n\nIn November the Navy had a hard lesson with underwater obstructions, coral, and tides at [[invasion of Tarawa|Tarawa]]. It prompted Adm.

Turner also requested formation of a \"Naval Combat Demolition Training & Experimental Base\" at [[Kihei, Hawaii]].  It was approved, with the lessons of UDT 1 incorporated into the training, making it distinctly different from that at Fort Pierce.  Lt. Crist was briefly the first training officer until when he was made Commander of UDT 3.  When UDT 3 returned from Leyte in November 1944 the team became the training instructors of the school and Lt. Crist was again OIC of training.<ref name=\"viewoftherockies\"/>   Under Lt. Crist the 2-month training course was broken into four 2 week blocks. With an overall emphasis on swimming and reconnaissance the teams also covered night ops, problems of control, small arms, bivouacking, small unit tactics, along with coral and lava blasting.  The team continued instructing until April 1945 when it was sent to Fort Priece to instruct there.  Lt. Crist was promoted to Lt. Cmdr and returned to Hawaii. Team 3 would train teams 12\u201322.<ref name=\"viewoftherockies\"/> Teams 12, 13 and 14 all had men from Team Able.  UDT 14 is called the first \"all fleet team\" even though Seabees from Team Able were attached and the Commander and XO were both CEC (Ltjg. A.B. Onderdonk and Ltjg. C.E. Emery).  UDT 15 was another team formed completely of NCDUs. Teams 12, 13, 14, and 15 were sent to Iwo Jima.

In April the Navy announced it would enlist African Americans in the Seabees. Even so, there were just two regular CBs that were \"[[colored]]\" units, the 34th<ref>Thirty Fourth Naval Construction Battalion, Cmdr Lester M.

Both had white Southern officers and black enlisted. Both battalions experienced problems with that arrangement that led to the replacement of the officers.  The men of the 34th went on a hunger strike which made the news.  The Commander of the 8oth had 19 enlisted discharged with dishonorable discharges for sedition.  The [[NAACP]] and [[Thurgood Marshall]] got 14 of those reversed.  In 1943 the Navy drew up a proposal to raise the number of colored CBs to 5 and require that all non-rated men in the next 24 CBs be colored.  The proposal was approved, but it did not happen.\n\nThe lack of stevedores for unloading ships in combat zones was a huge issue to the Navy.  Authorization for the formation of cargo handling CBs or \"Special CBs\" happened mid-September 1942.<ref name=\"CBHistory\">This week in Seabee History, Sept 17\u201323, Seabee Online Magazine, Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Washington Navy Yard, DC [http://seabeemagazine.navylive.dod live.mil/326-2/]</ref>  By wars end 41 Special CBs had been commissioned of which 15 were \"colored\".

Seabees landed at [[Battle of Inchon|Inchon]] during the assault, installing causeways dealing with enormous tides and enemy fire. Their actions there and elsewheres underscored the necessity of having CBs.  During that war the authorized size of a CB was 550 men. When the truce was declared there was no CB demobilization as there had been at the end of WWII.\n\nDuring the Korea, the U.S. realized the need of an air station in the region. [[Naval Air Station Cubi Point|Cubi Point]] in the Philippines was selected.   Civilian contractors were approached for bids. After seeing the [[Zambales Mountains]] and the maze of jungle, they claimed it could not be done. The Navy then turned to the Seabees. The first to arrive was CBD 1802 to do the surveying. [[Naval Mobile Construction Battalion Three|MCB 3]] arrived on 2 October 1951 to get the project going and was joined by MCB 5 in November. Over the next five years, MCBs 2, 7, 9, 11 and CBD 1803 all contributed to the effort. They leveled a mountain to make way for a nearly {{convert|2|mi|km|adj=mid|long}} runway. NAS Cubi Point turned out to be one of the largest earth-moving projects in the world, equivalent to the construction of the [[Panama Canal]]. Seabees there moved {{convert|20|e6cuyd|e6m3|abbr=off}} of dry fill plus another 15 million that was [[hydraulic fill]]. The $100&nbsp;million facility was commissioned on 25 July 1956, and comprised an air station and an adjacent pier that was capable of docking the Navy's largest carriers.

Barges with a 2.5' [[Draft (hull)|draft]] are loaded and floated to and from a mother container ship, facilitating loading and unloading of containerized cargo at sea.

Loaded barges can then be moved toward the vessel's bow by means of a track to be stowed on one of three decks. Seabee barge carriers can store 38 barges, 12 each on the lower decks and 14 on the upper deck. The 38 barges can hold 160 containers.

The use of USMC organization allowed for smooth co-ordination, integration or interface between NCF and Marine Corps elements.  Additionally, CBs could be deployed individually or in multiples as the project scope and scale dictated. What distinguishes Seabees from [[Combat Engineers]] are the skill sets.

In the October 1944 issue of ''[[Flying (magazine)|Flying]]'' magazine, the Seabees are described as \"a phenomenon of World War II\".<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n29lcdffPWgC&pg=PA261|title=The Seabees |magazine=[[Flying (magazine)|Flying]] |volume=35 |number=4 |date=October 1944 |page=261 |accessdate=18 October 2017 |quote=All in all, the Seabees look like a phenomenon of World War II and will probably die with it.}}</ref> The Seabees now have over 75 years of service without having changed from Adm. Moreell's model.\n\nSince creation Seabees have received all their advanced military training from the Marine Corps.  As  such, it is strictly standard conventional warfare.  Even so, Seabees always bring their toolbox.  One of those tools is the ingenuity Admiral King referenced.  They gained fame for their application of it during WWII.  The UDTs and flamethrowing tanks are declassified top secret examples. Post war they followed with more of the same for the CIA and State Department. Together with their USMC training and ability to appropriate anything, they provide the Navy an unconventional asset found nowhere else in the U.S military.\n\n== Naval construction history ==\n\n'''CB Conceptual Formation'''\n\nIn the early 1930s, the idea of the 1917 Twelfth Regiment was still remembered by the Navy's Civil Engineers.

In April the Navy announced it would enlist African Americans in the Seabees. Even so, there were just two regular CBs that were \"[[colored]]\" units, the 34th<ref>Thirty Fourth Naval Construction Battalion, Cmdr Lester M. Marx, Schwabacher Frey Company, San Francisco, CA, 1946 [https://books.google.com/books?id=znA2e9qPmaUC&pg=PT5]</ref> and 80th<ref>80th Naval Construction Battalion, Bickford Engraving And Electrotype Co. 20 Mathewson St., Providence, RI, 1946 [https://books.google.com/books?id=TVsdVqGsE5kC&pg=PA112]</ref> NCBs. Both had white Southern officers and black enlisted. Both battalions experienced problems with that arrangement that led to the replacement of the officers.  The men of the 34th went on a hunger strike which made the news.  The Commander of the 8oth had 19 enlisted discharged with dishonorable discharges for sedition.  The [[NAACP]] and [[Thurgood Marshall]] got 14 of those reversed.  In 1943 the Navy drew up a proposal to raise the number of colored CBs to 5 and require that all non-rated men in the next 24 CBs be colored.  The proposal was approved, but it did not happen.\n\nThe lack of stevedores for unloading ships in combat zones was a huge issue to the Navy.  Authorization for the formation of cargo handling CBs or \"Special CBs\" happened mid-September 1942.<ref name=\"CBHistory\">This week in Seabee History, Sept 17\u201323, Seabee Online Magazine, Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Washington Navy Yard, DC [http://seabeemagazine.navylive.dod live.mil/326-2/]</ref>  By wars end 41 Special CBs had been commissioned of which 15 were \"colored\".

After seeing the [[Zambales Mountains]] and the maze of jungle, they claimed it could not be done. The Navy then turned to the Seabees. The first to arrive was CBD 1802 to do the surveying. [[Naval Mobile Construction Battalion Three|MCB 3]] arrived on 2 October 1951 to get the project going and was joined by MCB 5 in November. Over the next five years, MCBs 2, 7, 9, 11 and CBD 1803 all contributed to the effort. They leveled a mountain to make way for a nearly {{convert|2|mi|km|adj=mid|long}} runway. NAS Cubi Point turned out to be one of the largest earth-moving projects in the world, equivalent to the construction of the [[Panama Canal]]. Seabees there moved {{convert|20|e6cuyd|e6m3|abbr=off}} of dry fill plus another 15 million that was [[hydraulic fill]]. The $100&nbsp;million facility was commissioned on 25 July 1956, and comprised an air station and an adjacent pier that was capable of docking the Navy's largest carriers. [[Adjusted-for-inflation]], today's price-tag for what the Seabees built at Cubi Point would be $906,871,323.53.\n\n'''Seabee Teams''' also called ''' Civic Action Teams or CAT<ref name=\"seabeemagazine.navylive.dodlive.mil\">{{Cite web|url=https://seabeemagazine.navylive.dodlive.mil/2018/01/04/civic-action-team-building-friendships/|title=Civic Action Team: Building Friendships}}</ref><ref>\"Civil Engineers, Seabees & Bases in Vietnam\", Captain Charles J.

From \"A\" School, trainees most often report to a NMCB or ACB. At those commands new Seabees will go through four-weeks of Expeditionary Combat Skills. ECS is also required for those who report to a unit in the [[Navy Expeditionary Combat Command]]. ECS is basic combat-training in: map reading, combat first aid, conducting recon, and other combat-related skills. Half of each course is spent learning basic marksmanship and qualifying with a [[M16 rifle#M16A2|M16A2]] or [[M16 rifle#M16A3|M16A3]] rifle and the [[Beretta M9|M9 service pistol]]. Those posted to Alfa Company of a NMCB may be assigned to a crew-served weapon: [[Mk 19 grenade launcher|MK 19]] 40mm grenade launcher, the [[M2 Browning|M2HB]] .50-caliber machine gun, or the [[M240 machine gun]]. Many reserve units still field the [[M60 machine gun]]. Until 2012, Seabees wore the [[U.S. Woodland]] camouflage uniform or the [[Desert Camouflage Uniform]], the last U.S. military to do so, but have transitioned to the Navy Working Uniform NWU Type III.

They had been in existence less than four years when this happened and the Navy had not created a Historical Branch or Archive for the NCF.  So, there was no central archive for Seabee history. As time passed, first with Korea and then Vietnam, Construction Battalions were reactivated with the units having no idea what the WWII insignia had been so they made new ones.\n\n==Seabee Combat Warfare Insignia and Peltier Award==\n[[File:Navy Seabee Combat Warfare Specialist Insignia.png|350px|right|thumb|SCW insignia: officer and enlisted]]\nThe military qualification badge for the Seabees is known as the Seabee combat warfare specialist insignia (SCW).

For requirements, see: Fleet Marine Force Warfare Specialist (EFMFWS) Program per [[OPNAV Instruction]] 1414.4B.\n\nThe Peltier Award is given to the \"best of type\" active duty Naval Construction Battalions.

The NCF primarily uses the Seabee barges .  Barges with a 2.5' [[Draft (hull)|draft]] are loaded and floated to and from a mother container ship, facilitating loading and unloading of containerized cargo at sea. These ships have an elevator system for loading the barges out of the water at the stern onto the vessel.   Loaded barges can then be moved toward the vessel's bow by means of a track to be stowed on one of three decks. Seabee barge carriers can store 38 barges, 12 each on the lower decks and 14 on the upper deck. The 38 barges can hold 160 containers.

For example: John said: \"I saw Mary today\". Quotations in oral speech are also signaled by special [[prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] in addition to quotative markers. In written text, quotations are signaled by quotation marks.<ref name=\"sdq bonami\">{{cite web |last1=Bonami |first1=Olivier |last2=Godard |first2=Dani\u00e8le |title=On the Syntax of Direct Quotation in French | date=2008 | url=https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-00751080/document |website=HAL |accessdate=10 April 2020}}</ref> Quotations are also used to present well-known statement parts that are explicitly attributed by [[citation]] to their original source; such statements are marked with ([[punctuation|punctuated]] with) [[quotation mark]]s.\n\nQuotations are often used as a literary device to represent someone's point of view. They are also widely used in spoken language when an interlocutor wishes to present a proposition that they have come to know via hearsay.\n\n\n==Quotations as a literary device==\nA quotation can also refer to the repeated use of units of any other form of expression, especially parts of artistic works: elements of a [[painting]], scenes from a [[film|movie]] or sections from a [[musical composition]].\n\n===Reasons for using quotations as a literary device===\nQuotations are used for a variety of reasons: to illuminate the meaning or to support the arguments of the work in which it is being quoted, to provide direct information about the work being quoted (whether in order to discuss it, positively or negatively), to pay homage to the original work or [[author]], to make the user of the quotation seem well-read, and/or to comply with copyright law.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.elc.edu/english-grammar-lesson-using-quotes/|title=English Grammar Lesson - Using Quotes! - ELC|date=2016-11-16|work=ELC - English Language Center|access-date=2017-10-24|language=en-US}}</ref> Quotations are also commonly printed as a means of inspiration and to invoke philosophical thoughts from the reader. Pragmatically speaking, quotations can also be used as language games (in the Wittgensteinian sense of the term) to manipulate social order and the structure of society.<ref>Capone, A., & Salmani Nodoushan, M.

Of these, ''[[Bartlett's Familiar Quotations]]'', ''[[The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations]]'', ''The [[Columbia University Press|Columbia]] Dictionary of Quotations'', ''[[The Yale Book of Quotations]]'' and ''The [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] Book of Proverbs, Maxims, and Famous Phrases'' are considered among the most reliable and comprehensive sources.  Diaries and calendars often include quotations for entertainment or inspirational purposes, and small, dedicated sections in newspapers and weekly magazines\u2014with recent quotations by leading personalities on current topics\u2014have also become commonplace.\n\n===Misquotations===\n{{further|False attribution}}\n{{See also|List of movie misquotes}}\nMany quotations are routinely incorrect or attributed to the wrong authors, and quotations from obscure or unknown writers are often attributed to far more famous writers. Examples of this are [[Winston Churchill]], to whom many political quotations of uncertain origin are attributed, and [[Oscar Wilde]], to whom anonymous humorous quotations are sometimes attributed.<ref>See ''A Book of Misquotations'', edited by Elizabeth Knowles, Oxford University Press, 2006.</ref>\n\nThe ''Star Trek'' catchphrase \"[[Beam me up, Scotty]]\" did not appear in that form in the original series. Other misquotations include \"[[Just the facts, ma'am]]\" (attributed to [[Jack Webb]]'s character of [[Joe Friday]] on ''[[Dragnet (series)|Dragnet]]''), \"Heavy lies the crown\" from Shakespeare's Play [[Henry IV, Part 2]], \"[[Sherlock Holmes#\"Elementary, my dear Watson\"|Elementary, my dear Watson]]\" (attributed to [[Sherlock Holmes]]; it was, however, said in the films ''[[The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes]]'' and ''[[The Return of Sherlock Holmes (1929 film)|The Return of Sherlock Holmes]]''), \"[[Luke, I am your father]]\" (attributed to [[Darth Vader]] in [[Star Wars]]), \"[[Casablanca (film)#Quotations|Play it again, Sam]]\" (attributed to Ilsa in ''[[Casablanca (film)#Quotations|Casablanca]]''), \"[[Do you feel lucky, punk?]]\" (attributed to [[Dirty Harry (character)|Harry Callahan]] in ''[[Dirty Harry]]'') and \"[[Stinking badges|We don't need no stinkin' badges!]]\" (attributed to Gold Hat in ''[[The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (film)|The Treasure of the Sierra Madre]]'').<ref>The Holmes phrase originated in a radio play.

Instead, they convey the approximative meaning of such an utterance along with the way in which that utterance was produced. From a [[sociolinguistics|sociolinguistic]] perspective, a quotation in spoken discourse can therefore also be defined as \u201ca performance whereby speakers re-enact previous behaviour (speech/thought/sound/voice effect and gesture) while assuming the dramatic role of the original source of this reported behaviour\u201d.<ref name=\"buch\">{{cite book |last1=Buchstaller |first1=Isabelle |title=Quotatives: New Trends and Sociolinguistic Implications |date=2014 |publisher=Wiley Blackwell |isbn=9780470657188 |edition=1st}}</ref>\n\nTraditionally, quotations\u2014more specifically known as direct quotations<ref name=\"clark\" />\u2014have been distinguished from indirect quotations. Direct quotations differ from indirect quotations in that they are reported from the perspective of the experiencer, while indirect quotations are reported from the perspective of the reporting speaker (e.g. ''\"He said: 'I am leaving now'\u201d'' versus ''\"He said (that) he was leaving immediately\"''); are free in their syntactic form, while indirect quotations are subject to language-specific structural requirements (e.g. indirect quotations in many [[Indo-European languages]] are required to have the syntactic form of a [[Well-formedness|well-formed]] declarative [[dependent clause|subordinate clause]]); incorporate extralinguistic material and pragmatic markers, while indirect quotations do not. Crucially, direct quotations have a performative aspect (i.e. occur simultaneously with re-enactments of previous behaviours), which indirect quotations lack.<ref name=\"buch\" /><ref name=\"clark\">{{cite journal |last1=Clark |first1=Herbert |last2=Gerrig |first2=Richard |title=Quotations as Demonstrations |journal=Language |date=December 1990 |volume=66 |issue=4 |pages=764\u2013805 |doi=10.2307/414729 |jstor=414729 |url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Quotations-as-Demonstrations.-Clark-Gerrig/54571a1199be1954678338a879189359fab44182 |accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Reasons for using quotations in spoken discourse===\n\nQuotations are employed in spoken discourse for many reasons. They are often used by speakers to depict stories and events that have occurred in the past to other [[Interlocutor (linguistics)|interlocutors]]. The speaker does not necessarily have to have been an original participant in the story or event. Therefore, they can quote something that they did not hear firsthand. Quotations are also used to express thoughts that have never been uttered aloud prior to being quoted. For example, while telling a story, a speaker quotes inner thoughts that they had during a specific situation. Finally, speakers use quotations to propose future dialogue for participants in a situation that may take place in the future. For example, two friends talk about their 10-year high school reunion that will take place in the future and propose what they would say. While future dialogue can be proposed for a situation that will likely happen, it can also be based on a situation that will not actually take place. In the latter usage, the proposed dialogue only exists in the conversational context.<ref name=\"jessie\">{{cite journal |last1=Sams |first1=Jessie |title=Quoting the unspoken: An analysis of quotations in spoken discourse |journal=Journal of Pragmatics |date=November 2010 |volume=42 |issue=11 |pages=3147\u20133160 |doi=10.1016/j.pragma.2010.04.024 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378216610001220 |accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe quoted material is usually not a verbatim replication of an utterance that someone originally said. Instead, quotations in spoken discourse reproduce what a speaker wishes to communicate to their recipients; quotations demonstrate something that someone said, the manner in which that person said it, and the current speaker\u2019s feelings about what was said.<ref name=\"jessie\" /><ref name=\"clark\" /> In this way, quotations are an especially effective storytelling device; the speaker is able to give a voice to the protagonists in their stories themselves, which allows the speaker\u2019s audience to experience the situation in the way that the speaker themselves experienced it.<ref name=\"buch\" />\n\n===Form of quotation===\n\nIn most languages, quotations in spoken discourse are introduced by a verb of saying and a pronoun. For example, a quotation in English can be introduced by ''\u201cShe said\u201d''. In some languages, there is a discourse marker in addition to the verb of saying that functions as verbal quotation marks.<ref name=\"tracy\"/> For example, Japanese uses the quotative particle (a type of quotative marker) ''to'' along with the conjugated verb of saying ''itta'':\n\nGloss: TOP=Topic Marker DAT=Dative NOM=Nominative COM=complementizer\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! \u3086\u304d !! \u306f !! \u3042\u306a\u305f\u3000!! \u306b\u306f !! \u5f7c\u5973 !! \u304c !! \u597d\u304d !! \u3068 !! \u8a00\u3063\u305f \u3002<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n|-\n| Yuki || wa || anata|| ni wa || kanocho || ga || suki || '''to''' || '''itta''' .\n|-\n| Yuki|| TOP || you || DAT || her || NOM || like || COM || said\n|-\n| colspan=9|\"''Yuki said that you liked her.''\"\n|}\n\nVerbs of saying (also known as quotative verbs) and quotative particles, along with quotative evidentials, are different types of quotative markers, which signal quotations in utterances.<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n\n====Quotative markers====\nQuotative markers are used to mark a section of an utterance as quoted speech (i.e. a quotation). In oral speech, quotative markers act as quotation marks and often include a verb of saying. Depending on the syntax of the language, the quotative appears either directly before or after the reported speech.<ref name=\"tracy\">{{cite book |editor1-last=Tracy |editor1-first=Karen |title=The International Encyclopedia of Language and Social Interaction Volume One |date=2015 |publisher=Wiley Blackwell |location=Chichester, West Sussex, UK |isbn=9781118611463 |pages=1272-1276}}</ref>\n\n==== English ====\nIn English, the verb ''\"be like\"'' or ''\"said\"'' are being used as quotatives in American English. <ref> Frederica Barbieri.

The verb is usually a verb of communication or thought. In spoken Japanese, the use of pronouns and honorific form are commonly seen; yet, honorific form is not an evidence between direct and indirect speech. Thus, Japanese fails to distinguish between direct and indirect speech as shown in the above examples.\n<ref name=\"Coulmas p164\"/>\n<br>\n\n==== Spanish ====\n===== Quotative Verb =====\n\n===Syntax of quotation===\nDifferent versions of quotative verbs, particles, and evidentials can be used to express the same idea with varying nuances, often to frame how the primary speaker, or the person who is quoting, feels about a quotation. The syntax of quotations varies cross-linguistically. A primary speaker may use the tense and linguistic idiosyncrasies of the speech at the time it was uttered in a quotation, independent from the tense in the main clause in some languages, or use the same tense in both the main clause and quotation in other languages. They will also use [[coreference|coreferenced]] pronouns to the direct quotation's first-person subject in the main clause: She<sub>x</sub> said, \"I<sub>x</sub>...\"; they<sub>y</sub> said \"we<sub>y</sub> ...\" In many languages, the primary speaker may also attempt to quote an utterance in the same language the original speaker used, even if an interlocutor does not understand it; however, it is mainly context-dependent such as when telling stories.  <ref name=\"Evans Canonical\">{{cite book |last1=Evans |first1=Nicholas |title=Canonical Morphology and Syntax |date=2012 |publisher=Oxford University Press |chapter=Some problems in the typology of quotation: a canonical approach}}</ref><ref name=\"Klamer report\">{{cite journal |last1=Klamer |first1=Marian |title=How report verbs become quote markers and complementisers |journal=Lingua |date=2000 |volume=110 |issue=2 |pages=69\u201398 |doi=10.1016/S0024-3841(99)00032-7|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024384199000327 | accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"DarcyA Review>{{cite journal |last1=D'Arcy |first1=Alexandra |title=Quotation and advances in understanding syntactic systems |journal=Annual Review of Linguistics |volume=1 |issue=1 |page=43-61 |doi=10.1146/annurev-linguist-030514-125220}}</ref>\n\n=====Quotative verbs=====\nQuotative verbs are lexical verbs that indicate the speech, thoughts, or perceptions of the original speaker.<ref name=\"Evans Canonical\"/><ref name=\"Klamer report\"/>\n\nQuotations can be introduced as the complement to a quotative verb or as the head phrase to an adjunct phrase containing a quotative verb in some languages like English and French.<ref name=\"sdq bonami\"/><ref name=\"DarcyA Review/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! ||Quotation as complement || Quotation as head phrase adjunct <ref name=\"sdq bonami\"/>\n|-\n| English || Marie said, \u201cMy brother has arrived.\u201d || \u201cMy brother has arrived,\" as Marie said.\n|-\n| French || Marie a dit, \u201cMon fr\u00e8re est arriv\u00e9.\u201d || \u201cMon fr\u00e8re est arriv\u00e9,\" comme a dit Marie.\n|}\nEnglish also displays [[verb-second]] (V2) order vestige only in quotation contexts (quotative inversion), requiring the finite verb to appear in the second position of a clause. For example: \"No no no\" ''says'' Harry. <ref name=\"DarcyA Review/>\n\nDirect and indirect quotations are sometimes not distinguishable. Traditionally, English uses an overt complementizer ''that'' after a quotative verb to indicate indirect quotation, but it is also seen to prompt direct quotation in some English varieties like Indian English, Hong Kong English, and Kenyan English.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Hong Kong English || After the movie I just ''said that'' \"Oh Frank I cannot walk.\" <ref name=\"DarcyA Review\"/>\n|-\n| Indian English || Never a husband ''says that'' \"I'll make a cup of tea okay, you sit.

Common patterns of grammaticalization trajectories include verb to complementizer in many African and Asian languages and verb to [[tense-aspect-mood]] markers primarily in African languages, but also in Australian languages and multiple other [[language family|language families]]. <ref name=\"DarcyA Review/><ref name=\"Matsui and Yamamoto\">{{cite journal |last1=Matsui |first1=Tomoko |last2=Yamamoto |first2=Taeko |title=Developing sensitivity to the sources of information: Early use of the Japanese quotative particles tte and to in mother\u2013child conversation |journal=Journal of Pragmatics |date=2013 |volume=59 |issue= |pages=5\u201325 |doi=10.1016/j.pragma.2013.06.008 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378216613001598|accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nJapanese, for example, uses a sentence-final quotative particle ''tte'' verbally to mean \"I heard (quote)\" with some uncertainty.

They are also widely used in spoken language when an interlocutor wishes to present a proposition that they have come to know via hearsay.\n\n\n==Quotations as a literary device==\nA quotation can also refer to the repeated use of units of any other form of expression, especially parts of artistic works: elements of a [[painting]], scenes from a [[film|movie]] or sections from a [[musical composition]].\n\n===Reasons for using quotations as a literary device===\nQuotations are used for a variety of reasons: to illuminate the meaning or to support the arguments of the work in which it is being quoted, to provide direct information about the work being quoted (whether in order to discuss it, positively or negatively), to pay homage to the original work or [[author]], to make the user of the quotation seem well-read, and/or to comply with copyright law.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.elc.edu/english-grammar-lesson-using-quotes/|title=English Grammar Lesson - Using Quotes! - ELC|date=2016-11-16|work=ELC - English Language Center|access-date=2017-10-24|language=en-US}}</ref> Quotations are also commonly printed as a means of inspiration and to invoke philosophical thoughts from the reader. Pragmatically speaking, quotations can also be used as language games (in the Wittgensteinian sense of the term) to manipulate social order and the structure of society.<ref>Capone, A., & Salmani Nodoushan, M. A. (2014). On indirect reports and language games: Evidence from Persian. Rivista Italiana di Filosofia del Linguaggio, 8(2), 26-42.</ref><ref>Salmani Nodoushan, M. A. (2015).

Rivista Italiana di Filosofia del Linguaggio, 9(2), 92-112.</ref>\n\n===Common quotation sources===\nFamous quotations are frequently collected in books that are sometimes called quotation dictionaries or treasuries.  Of these, ''[[Bartlett's Familiar Quotations]]'', ''[[The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations]]'', ''The [[Columbia University Press|Columbia]] Dictionary of Quotations'', ''[[The Yale Book of Quotations]]'' and ''The [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] Book of Proverbs, Maxims, and Famous Phrases'' are considered among the most reliable and comprehensive sources.  Diaries and calendars often include quotations for entertainment or inspirational purposes, and small, dedicated sections in newspapers and weekly magazines\u2014with recent quotations by leading personalities on current topics\u2014have also become commonplace.\n\n===Misquotations===\n{{further|False attribution}}\n{{See also|List of movie misquotes}}\nMany quotations are routinely incorrect or attributed to the wrong authors, and quotations from obscure or unknown writers are often attributed to far more famous writers. Examples of this are [[Winston Churchill]], to whom many political quotations of uncertain origin are attributed, and [[Oscar Wilde]], to whom anonymous humorous quotations are sometimes attributed.<ref>See ''A Book of Misquotations'', edited by Elizabeth Knowles, Oxford University Press, 2006.</ref>\n\nThe ''Star Trek'' catchphrase \"[[Beam me up, Scotty]]\" did not appear in that form in the original series. Other misquotations include \"[[Just the facts, ma'am]]\" (attributed to [[Jack Webb]]'s character of [[Joe Friday]] on ''[[Dragnet (series)|Dragnet]]''), \"Heavy lies the crown\" from Shakespeare's Play [[Henry IV, Part 2]], \"[[Sherlock Holmes#\"Elementary, my dear Watson\"|Elementary, my dear Watson]]\" (attributed to [[Sherlock Holmes]]; it was, however, said in the films ''[[The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes]]'' and ''[[The Return of Sherlock Holmes (1929 film)|The Return of Sherlock Holmes]]''), \"[[Luke, I am your father]]\" (attributed to [[Darth Vader]] in [[Star Wars]]), \"[[Casablanca (film)#Quotations|Play it again, Sam]]\" (attributed to Ilsa in ''[[Casablanca (film)#Quotations|Casablanca]]''), \"[[Do you feel lucky, punk?]]\" (attributed to [[Dirty Harry (character)|Harry Callahan]] in ''[[Dirty Harry]]'') and \"[[Stinking badges|We don't need no stinkin' badges!]]\" (attributed to Gold Hat in ''[[The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (film)|The Treasure of the Sierra Madre]]'').<ref>The Holmes phrase originated in a radio play.

Instead, they convey the approximative meaning of such an utterance along with the way in which that utterance was produced. From a [[sociolinguistics|sociolinguistic]] perspective, a quotation in spoken discourse can therefore also be defined as \u201ca performance whereby speakers re-enact previous behaviour (speech/thought/sound/voice effect and gesture) while assuming the dramatic role of the original source of this reported behaviour\u201d.<ref name=\"buch\">{{cite book |last1=Buchstaller |first1=Isabelle |title=Quotatives: New Trends and Sociolinguistic Implications |date=2014 |publisher=Wiley Blackwell |isbn=9780470657188 |edition=1st}}</ref>\n\nTraditionally, quotations\u2014more specifically known as direct quotations<ref name=\"clark\" />\u2014have been distinguished from indirect quotations. Direct quotations differ from indirect quotations in that they are reported from the perspective of the experiencer, while indirect quotations are reported from the perspective of the reporting speaker (e.g. ''\"He said: 'I am leaving now'\u201d'' versus ''\"He said (that) he was leaving immediately\"''); are free in their syntactic form, while indirect quotations are subject to language-specific structural requirements (e.g. indirect quotations in many [[Indo-European languages]] are required to have the syntactic form of a [[Well-formedness|well-formed]] declarative [[dependent clause|subordinate clause]]); incorporate extralinguistic material and pragmatic markers, while indirect quotations do not. Crucially, direct quotations have a performative aspect (i.e. occur simultaneously with re-enactments of previous behaviours), which indirect quotations lack.<ref name=\"buch\" /><ref name=\"clark\">{{cite journal |last1=Clark |first1=Herbert |last2=Gerrig |first2=Richard |title=Quotations as Demonstrations |journal=Language |date=December 1990 |volume=66 |issue=4 |pages=764\u2013805 |doi=10.2307/414729 |jstor=414729 |url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Quotations-as-Demonstrations.-Clark-Gerrig/54571a1199be1954678338a879189359fab44182 |accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Reasons for using quotations in spoken discourse===\n\nQuotations are employed in spoken discourse for many reasons. They are often used by speakers to depict stories and events that have occurred in the past to other [[Interlocutor (linguistics)|interlocutors]]. The speaker does not necessarily have to have been an original participant in the story or event. Therefore, they can quote something that they did not hear firsthand. Quotations are also used to express thoughts that have never been uttered aloud prior to being quoted. For example, while telling a story, a speaker quotes inner thoughts that they had during a specific situation. Finally, speakers use quotations to propose future dialogue for participants in a situation that may take place in the future. For example, two friends talk about their 10-year high school reunion that will take place in the future and propose what they would say. While future dialogue can be proposed for a situation that will likely happen, it can also be based on a situation that will not actually take place. In the latter usage, the proposed dialogue only exists in the conversational context.<ref name=\"jessie\">{{cite journal |last1=Sams |first1=Jessie |title=Quoting the unspoken: An analysis of quotations in spoken discourse |journal=Journal of Pragmatics |date=November 2010 |volume=42 |issue=11 |pages=3147\u20133160 |doi=10.1016/j.pragma.2010.04.024 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378216610001220 |accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe quoted material is usually not a verbatim replication of an utterance that someone originally said. Instead, quotations in spoken discourse reproduce what a speaker wishes to communicate to their recipients; quotations demonstrate something that someone said, the manner in which that person said it, and the current speaker\u2019s feelings about what was said.<ref name=\"jessie\" /><ref name=\"clark\" /> In this way, quotations are an especially effective storytelling device; the speaker is able to give a voice to the protagonists in their stories themselves, which allows the speaker\u2019s audience to experience the situation in the way that the speaker themselves experienced it.<ref name=\"buch\" />\n\n===Form of quotation===\n\nIn most languages, quotations in spoken discourse are introduced by a verb of saying and a pronoun. For example, a quotation in English can be introduced by ''\u201cShe said\u201d''. In some languages, there is a discourse marker in addition to the verb of saying that functions as verbal quotation marks.<ref name=\"tracy\"/> For example, Japanese uses the quotative particle (a type of quotative marker) ''to'' along with the conjugated verb of saying ''itta'':\n\nGloss: TOP=Topic Marker DAT=Dative NOM=Nominative COM=complementizer\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! \u3086\u304d !! \u306f !! \u3042\u306a\u305f\u3000!! \u306b\u306f !! \u5f7c\u5973 !! \u304c !! \u597d\u304d !! \u3068 !! \u8a00\u3063\u305f \u3002<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n|-\n| Yuki || wa || anata|| ni wa || kanocho || ga || suki || '''to''' || '''itta''' .\n|-\n| Yuki|| TOP || you || DAT || her || NOM || like || COM || said\n|-\n| colspan=9|\"''Yuki said that you liked her.''\"\n|}\n\nVerbs of saying (also known as quotative verbs) and quotative particles, along with quotative evidentials, are different types of quotative markers, which signal quotations in utterances.<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n\n====Quotative markers====\nQuotative markers are used to mark a section of an utterance as quoted speech (i.e. a quotation). In oral speech, quotative markers act as quotation marks and often include a verb of saying.

The verb is usually a verb of communication or thought. In spoken Japanese, the use of pronouns and honorific form are commonly seen; yet, honorific form is not an evidence between direct and indirect speech. Thus, Japanese fails to distinguish between direct and indirect speech as shown in the above examples.\n<ref name=\"Coulmas p164\"/>\n<br>\n\n==== Spanish ====\n===== Quotative Verb =====\n\n===Syntax of quotation===\nDifferent versions of quotative verbs, particles, and evidentials can be used to express the same idea with varying nuances, often to frame how the primary speaker, or the person who is quoting, feels about a quotation. The syntax of quotations varies cross-linguistically. A primary speaker may use the tense and linguistic idiosyncrasies of the speech at the time it was uttered in a quotation, independent from the tense in the main clause in some languages, or use the same tense in both the main clause and quotation in other languages. They will also use [[coreference|coreferenced]] pronouns to the direct quotation's first-person subject in the main clause: She<sub>x</sub> said, \"I<sub>x</sub>...\"; they<sub>y</sub> said \"we<sub>y</sub> ...\" In many languages, the primary speaker may also attempt to quote an utterance in the same language the original speaker used, even if an interlocutor does not understand it; however, it is mainly context-dependent such as when telling stories.  <ref name=\"Evans Canonical\">{{cite book |last1=Evans |first1=Nicholas |title=Canonical Morphology and Syntax |date=2012 |publisher=Oxford University Press |chapter=Some problems in the typology of quotation: a canonical approach}}</ref><ref name=\"Klamer report\">{{cite journal |last1=Klamer |first1=Marian |title=How report verbs become quote markers and complementisers |journal=Lingua |date=2000 |volume=110 |issue=2 |pages=69\u201398 |doi=10.1016/S0024-3841(99)00032-7|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024384199000327 | accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"DarcyA Review>{{cite journal |last1=D'Arcy |first1=Alexandra |title=Quotation and advances in understanding syntactic systems |journal=Annual Review of Linguistics |volume=1 |issue=1 |page=43-61 |doi=10.1146/annurev-linguist-030514-125220}}</ref>\n\n=====Quotative verbs=====\nQuotative verbs are lexical verbs that indicate the speech, thoughts, or perceptions of the original speaker.<ref name=\"Evans Canonical\"/><ref name=\"Klamer report\"/>\n\nQuotations can be introduced as the complement to a quotative verb or as the head phrase to an adjunct phrase containing a quotative verb in some languages like English and French.<ref name=\"sdq bonami\"/><ref name=\"DarcyA Review/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! ||Quotation as complement || Quotation as head phrase adjunct <ref name=\"sdq bonami\"/>\n|-\n| English || Marie said, \u201cMy brother has arrived.\u201d || \u201cMy brother has arrived,\" as Marie said.\n|-\n| French || Marie a dit, \u201cMon fr\u00e8re est arriv\u00e9.\u201d || \u201cMon fr\u00e8re est arriv\u00e9,\" comme a dit Marie.\n|}\nEnglish also displays [[verb-second]] (V2) order vestige only in quotation contexts (quotative inversion), requiring the finite verb to appear in the second position of a clause. For example: \"No no no\" ''says'' Harry. <ref name=\"DarcyA Review/>\n\nDirect and indirect quotations are sometimes not distinguishable. Traditionally, English uses an overt complementizer ''that'' after a quotative verb to indicate indirect quotation, but it is also seen to prompt direct quotation in some English varieties like Indian English, Hong Kong English, and Kenyan English.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Hong Kong English || After the movie I just ''said that'' \"Oh Frank I cannot walk.\" <ref name=\"DarcyA Review\"/>\n|-\n| Indian English || Never a husband ''says that'' \"I'll make a cup of tea okay, you sit. I'll make a cup of tea.\"\n|-\n| Kenyan English || So Kabuwe Abuwe ''told'' us ''that'' \"If it is for wedding I am not going to contribute.\"\n|}\n\n=====Quotative particles=====\nQuotative or hearsay particles are grammatical markers equivalent to full lexical verbs with meanings of ''\"say, mention, tell, etc.\"'' In many languages, they are [[grammaticalization|grammaticalized]] to different extremes from their previously lexical form. Common patterns of grammaticalization trajectories include verb to complementizer in many African and Asian languages and verb to [[tense-aspect-mood]] markers primarily in African languages, but also in Australian languages and multiple other [[language family|language families]]. <ref name=\"DarcyA Review/><ref name=\"Matsui and Yamamoto\">{{cite journal |last1=Matsui |first1=Tomoko |last2=Yamamoto |first2=Taeko |title=Developing sensitivity to the sources of information: Early use of the Japanese quotative particles tte and to in mother\u2013child conversation |journal=Journal of Pragmatics |date=2013 |volume=59 |issue= |pages=5\u201325 |doi=10.1016/j.pragma.2013.06.008 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378216613001598|accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nJapanese, for example, uses a sentence-final quotative particle ''tte'' verbally to mean \"I heard (quote)\" with some uncertainty. In sentence-medial position, ''tte'' is sometimes regarded along with ''to'' to be either a quotative particle or complementizer meaning \"I heard (quote)\" with less uncertainty and often more knowledge of the origin of the quote.\n\nGloss: QP=Quotative Particle FP=Final Particle\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| \u660e\u65e5 || \u6674\u308c\u308b || -\u3063\u3066\u3000<ref name=\"Matsui and Yamamoto\" />\n|-\n| Ashita || hareru || ''tte''.\n|-\n| tomorrow || will-be-fine || QP\n|-\n| colspan=7|\"''It will be fine tomorrow, I heard.''\"\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| \u660e\u65e5 || \u6674\u308c\u308b || -\u3063\u3066/\u3068 || \u8a00\u3063\u3066\u305f\u3000||\u3000\u3088\u3000<ref name=\"Matsui and Yamamoto\" />\n|-\n| Ashita || hareru || ''tte''/''to'' || itteta || yo.\n|-\n| tomorrow || will-be-fine || QP || said || FP\n|-\n| colspan=7|\"''(X) said that it would be fine tomorrow.''\"\n|}\n\nVerbs of saying are highly restricted in Australian languages and almost always immediately proceed the complement verb. \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Languages indicate this in various ways such as through additional words and phrases, prosody, gestures, or required endings of verbs. For example, English can express evidentials with an optional adverb, \"''Allegedly'', Annie pulled the trigger.\" The interlocutor then knows where the source of the quotation is from. <ref name=\"SRL Ev>{{cite journal |last1=San Roque |first1=Lila |title=Evidentiality |journal=Annual Review of Anthropology |date=2019 |volume=48 |issue= |pages=353\u2013370 |doi=10.1146/annurev-anthro-102218-011243 }}</ref> Similar to quotative particles, quotative evidentials are usually [[grammaticalization|grammaticalized]] from full lexical verbs. <ref name=\"Chojnicka Latvian\">{{cite journal |last1=Chojnicka |first1=Joanna |title=Latvian verbs of speaking and their relations to evidentiality |journal=Kalbotyra |issue=69 |page=59-81}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{wikiquote}}\n{{Wikisource portal|Quotations}}\n{{div col}}\n*[[Adage]]\n*[[Aphorism]]\n*[[Block quotation]]\n*[[Epigram]]\n*[[Fallacy of quoting out of context]]\n*[[Saying|Maxim (saying)]]\n*[[Musical quotation]]\n*[[Nested quotation]]\n*[[Proverb]]\n*[[Scare quotes]]\n*[[Sic]]\n*[[Use\u2013mention distinction]]\n*[[Quotation mark]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n<!--===========================({{NoMoreLinks}})===============================\n    | PLEASE BE CAUTIOUS IN ADDING MORE LINKS TO THIS ARTICLE.
