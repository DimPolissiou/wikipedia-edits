It was the first crewed spacecraft to operate exclusively in the airless vacuum of space, and remains the only crewed vehicle to land anywhere beyond Earth.\n\nStructurally and aerodynamically incapable of flight through Earth's atmosphere, the two-stage lunar module was ferried to lunar orbit attached to the [[Apollo command and service module]] (CSM), about twice its mass. Its crew of two flew the complete lunar module from lunar orbit to the Moon's surface.  During takeoff, the spent descent stage was used as a launch pad for the ascent stage which then [[Lunar orbit rendezvous|flew back to the command module]], after which it was also discarded.\n\nOverseen by [[Grumman Aircraft]], the LM's development was plagued with problems that delayed its first uncrewed flight by about ten months and its first crewed flight by about three months. Still, the LM became the most reliable component of the Apollo/Saturn [[space vehicle]].<ref>''Moon Race: The History of Apollo'' DVD, Columbia River Entertainment (Portland, Oregon, 2007)</ref>  The total cost of the LM for development and the units produced was $21.3&nbsp;billion in 2016 dollars, adjusting from a nominal total of $2.2&nbsp;billion<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://georgetyson.com/files/apollostatistics.pdf|title=Apollo by the Numbers|last=Orloff|first=Richard|publisher=[[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]]|year=1996|isbn=|location=|page=22}}</ref> using the NASA New Start Inflation Indices.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/files/2013_NNSI_FY14(1).xlsx|title=NASA New Start Inflation Indices|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=National Aeronautics and Space Administration|access-date=May 23, 2016}}</ref>\n\nTen lunar modules were launched into space. Of these, six landed humans on the Moon from 1969 to 1972. The first two launched were test flights in [[low Earth orbit]]\u2014the first without a crew, the second with one. Another was used by [[Apollo 10]] for a dress rehearsal flight in low lunar orbit, without landing. One lunar module functioned as a lifeboat for the crew of [[Apollo 13]], providing life support and propulsion when their CSM was disabled by an oxygen tank explosion en route to the Moon, forcing the crew to abandon plans for landing.\n\nThe six landed descent stages remain at their landing sites; their corresponding ascent stages crashed into the Moon following use. One ascent stage (Apollo 10's ''Snoopy'') was discarded in a [[heliocentric orbit]] after its descent stage was discarded in lunar orbit.  The other three LMs were burned up in the Earth's atmosphere: the four stages of [[Apollo 5]] and [[Apollo 9]] each re-entered separately, while Apollo 13's ''Aquarius'' re-entered complete, following emergency maneuvers.\n\n==Operational profile==\nAt launch, the lunar module sat directly beneath the [[Apollo command and service module|command and service module]] (CSM) with legs folded, inside the [[Apollo (spacecraft)#Spacecraft\u2013lunar module adapter (SLA)|Spacecraft-to-LM adapter (SLA)]] attached to the [[S-IVB]] third stage of the [[Saturn V]] rocket. There it remained through Earth parking orbit and the [[trans-lunar injection]] (TLI) rocket burn to send the craft toward the Moon.\n\nSoon after TLI, the SLA opened; the CSM separated, turned around, came back to dock with the lunar module, and extracted it from the S-IVB. During the flight to the Moon, the docking hatches were opened and the lunar module pilot entered the LM to temporarily power up and test all systems except propulsion. The lunar module pilot performed the role of an engineering officer, monitoring the systems of both spacecraft.\n\nAfter achieving a lunar parking orbit, the commander and LM pilot entered and powered up the LM, replaced the hatches and docking equipment, unfolded and locked its landing legs, and separated from the CSM, flying independently. The commander operated the flight controls and engine throttle, while the lunar module pilot operated other spacecraft systems and kept the commander informed about systems status and navigational information. After the command module pilot visually inspected the [[Landing gear (spaceflight)|landing gear]], the LM was withdrawn to a safe distance, then rotated until the [[Descent propulsion system|descent engine]] was pointed forward into the direction of travel. A 30-second descent orbit insertion burn was performed to reduce speed and drop the LM's [[perilune]] to within about {{convert|50000|ft|km}} of the surface,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4029/Apollo_11g_Lunar_Orbit_Phase.htm|title=Apollo 11 Lunar Orbit Phase|publisher=}}</ref> about {{convert|260|nmi|km}} uprange of the landing site.\n\n[[File:Earth, Moon and Lunar Module, AS11-44-6643.jpg|thumb|''Eagle'', the lunar module ascent stage of [[Apollo 11]], in orbit above the Moon. Earth is visible in the distance. Photograph by [[Michael Collins (astronaut)|Michael Collins]].]]\n\nAs the craft approached perilune, the [[Pintle injector|descent engine]] was started again to begin powered descent. During this time, the crew flew on their backs, depending on the computer to slow the craft's forward and vertical velocity to near zero. Control was exercised with a combination of engine throttling and attitude thrusters, guided by the computer with the aid of landing radar. During braking, the LM descended to about {{convert|10000|ft|km}}, then, in the final approach phase, down to about {{convert|700|ft|m}}. During final approach, the vehicle pitched over to a near-vertical position, allowing the crew to look forward and down to see the lunar surface for the first time.<ref>\n{{cite book\n| last = Gatland\n| first = Kenneth\n| title = Manned Spacecraft, Second Revision\n| publisher = Macmillan Publishing Co.\n| location = New York\n| year = 1976\n| pages = 194\u2013196\n| isbn = 0-02-542820-9 }}\n</ref>\n\nAstronauts flew Apollo spacecraft manually only during the lunar approach.<ref name=\"agle199809\">{{Cite magazine |last=Agle |first=D.C. |date=September 1998 |title=Flying the Gusmobile |url=https://www.airspacemag.com/flight-today/flying-the-gusmobile-218187/ |magazine=Air & Space |language=en |access-date=2018-12-15}}</ref> The final landing phase began about {{convert|2000|ft|km}} uprange of the targeted landing site. At this point, manual control was enabled for the commander, who had enough [[liquid rocket propellant|propellant]] to hover for up to two minutes to survey where the computer was taking the craft and make any necessary corrections. If necessary, landing could have been aborted at almost any time by jettisoning the descent stage and firing the ascent engine to climb back into orbit for an emergency return to the CSM. Finally, one or more of three {{convert|67.2|in|m|adj=on}} probes extending from footpads on the legs of the lander touched the surface, activating the contact indicator light which signaled the commander to manually shut off the descent engine, allowing the LM to settle onto the surface. On touchdown, the probes would be bent as much as 180 degrees, or even break off. The original design used the probes on all four legs, but starting with the first landing (LM-5 on Apollo 11), the one at the ladder was removed out of concern that the bent probe after landing might puncture an astronaut's suit as he descended or stepped off the ladder.\n\nThe original [[extravehicular activity]] (EVA) plan, up through at least 1966, was for only one astronaut to leave the LM while the other remained inside \"to maintain communications\".<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6UuRCwsGugg&t=3m20s Landing on the Moon], 1966 episode of MIT's ''Science Reporter'' (posted to YouTube by MIT on Jan 20, 2016)<br />Quote:<br />\"While one astronaut explores the area around the LEM, the second remains inside to maintain communications.\"</ref> Communications were eventually deemed to be reliable enough to allow both crew members to walk on the surface, leaving the spacecraft to be only remotely attended by Mission Control.\n\nBeginning with [[Apollo 14]], extra LM propellant was made available for the powered descent and landing, by using the CSM engine to achieve the {{convert|50000|ft|km|adj=on}} perilune. After the spacecraft undocked, the CSM raised and circularized its orbit for the remainder of the mission.\n\nWhen ready to leave the Moon, the LM's ascent engine fired, leaving the descent stage on the Moon's surface. After a few course correction burns, the LM rendezvoused with the CSM and docked to transfer the crew and rock samples. Having completed its job, the ascent stage was separated. The Apollo 10 ascent stage engine was fired until its fuel was used up, sending it past the Moon into a [[heliocentric orbit]].<ref name=\"nasa_apollo10\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/apollo/missions/apollo10.html |title=Apollo 10 |editor-last=Ryba |editor-first=Jeanne |publisher=NASA |accessdate=June 26, 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"disposition\">{{cite web|title=Current locations of the Apollo Command Module Capsules (and Lunar Module crash sites)|url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/lunar/apolloloc.html|website=Apollo: Where are they now?|publisher=NASA|accessdate=27 December 2014}}</ref> The [[Apollo 11]] ascent stage was left in lunar orbit to eventually crash; all subsequent ascent stages (except for Apollo 13) were intentionally steered into the Moon to obtain readings from seismometers placed on the surface.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Joseph Francis Shea.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A 1962 model of the first LEM design, docked to the command and service module. The model is held by [[Joseph Francis Shea|Joseph Shea]], the key engineer behind the adoption of [[lunar orbit rendezvous]] mission logistics.]]\nThe lunar module (originally designated the lunar excursion module, known by the [[Acronym and initialism|acronym]] LEM) was designed after NASA [[Project Apollo#Choosing a mission mode|chose to reach the Moon]] via [[Lunar Orbit Rendezvous]] (LOR) instead of the [[direct ascent]] or [[Earth Orbit Rendezvous]] (EOR) methods. Both direct ascent and EOR would have involved landing a much heavier, complete Apollo spacecraft on the Moon. Once the decision had been made to proceed using LOR, it became necessary to produce a separate craft capable of reaching the lunar surface and ascending back to lunar orbit.\n\n===Contract letting===\nIn July 1962, eleven firms were invited to submit proposals for the LEM. Nine companies responded in September, answering 20 questions posed by the NASA RFP in a 60-page limited technical proposal. [[Grumman Aircraft]] was awarded the contract two months later. Grumman had begun lunar orbit rendezvous studies in the late 1950s and again in 1961. The contract cost was expected to be around $350&nbsp;million. There were initially four major subcontractors: [[Bell Aerosystems]] ([[Ascent Propulsion System|ascent engine]]), [[Hamilton Standard]] (environmental control systems), [[Marquardt Corporation|Marquardt]] (reaction control system) and [[TRW Inc.|TRW's]] [[Space Technology Laboratories]] ([[Descent Propulsion System|descent engine]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4205/ch6-5.html |title=Chariots for Apollo: A History of Manned Lunar Spacecraft; Engines, Large and Small |author1=Courtney G.

A backup navigation tool, the [[Apollo Abort Guidance System|Abort Guidance System]] (AGS), was developed by TRW.\n\n===Design phase===\n[[File:Lunar Lander Model.jpg|thumb|This 1963 model depicts the second LEM design, which gave rise to informal references as \"the bug\".]]\nThe Apollo Lunar Module was chiefly designed by Grumman aerospace engineer [[Thomas J.

The second design invoked the idea of a helicopter cockpit with large curved windows and seats, to improve the astronauts' visibility for hover and landing. This also included a second, forward docking port, allowing the LEM crew to take an active role in docking with the CSM.\n\nAs the program continued, there were numerous redesigns to save weight, improve safety, and fix problems. First to go were the heavy cockpit windows and the seats; the astronauts would stand while flying the LEM, supported by a cable and pulley system, with smaller triangular windows giving them sufficient visibility of the landing site. Later, the redundant forward docking port was removed, which meant the Command Pilot gave up active control of the docking to the Command Module Pilot; he could still see the approaching CSM through a small overhead window. Egress while wearing bulky [[Extra-vehicular activity|Extra-Vehicular Activity]] (EVA) spacesuits was eased by a simpler forward hatch (32 x 32 inches).\n\nThe configuration was frozen in April 1963, when the ascent and descent engine designs were decided. In addition to Rocketdyne, a parallel program for the [[Descent propulsion system|descent engine]]<ref>{{Cite book|last=|first=|url=https://history.nasa.gov/monograph45.pdf|title=REMEMBERING THE GIANTS - Apollo Rocket Propulsion Development - NASA|publisher=NASA|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=73-86}}</ref> was ordered from [[TRW Inc.#Space exploration|Space Technology Laboratories (TRW)]] in July 1963, and by January 1965 the Rocketdyne contract was canceled.\n\nPower was initially to be produced by [[fuel cell]]s built by [[Pratt and Whitney]] similar to the CSM, but in March 1965 these were discarded in favor of an all-battery design.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/craft/lmerical.htm|title=LM Electrical|publisher=[[Encyclopedia Astronautica]]|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100201084039/http://astronautix.com/craft/lmerical.htm|archivedate=2010-02-01}}</ref>\n<!-- {{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} -->\n\nThe initial design had three landing legs, the lightest possible configuration. But as any particular leg would have to carry the weight of the vehicle if it landed at a significant angle, this was also the least stable configuration if one of the legs were damaged during landing. The next landing gear design iteration had five legs and was the most stable configuration for landing on an unknown terrain. That configuration, however, was too heavy and the designers compromised on four landing legs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/craft/lmlggear.htm|title=LM Landing Gear|publisher=Encyclopedia Astronautica|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100201083530/http://astronautix.com/craft/lmlggear.htm|archivedate=2010-02-01}}</ref>\n<!-- {{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} -->\n\nIn June 1966, the name was changed to lunar module (LM), eliminating the word \"excursion\".<ref>{{cite web |title=SP-4402 Origins of NASA Names |url=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4402/ch4.htm |website=NASA History |publisher=NASA |accessdate=January 16, 2015}}</ref><ref>Scheer, Julian W.

Successful testing of two LLRV prototypes at the [[Dryden Flight Research Center]] led in 1966 to three production Lunar Landing Training Vehicles (LLTV) which along with the LLRV's were used to train the astronauts at the Houston Manned Spacecraft Center. This aircraft proved fairly dangerous to fly, as three of the five were destroyed in crashes. It was equipped with a rocket-powered ejection seat, so in each case the pilot survived, including the first man to walk on the Moon, [[Neil Armstrong]].<ref name=\"ugly\">{{cite web|url=https://history.nasa.gov/alsj/alsj-LLRV.html|title=LLRV Monograph|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===Development flights===\n[[File:67-H-1230 Lunar module LTA-2 R.jpg|thumb|The [[Apollo 6]] Lunar Module Test Article (LTA-2R) shortly before being mated with the SLA]]\n\nLM-1 was built to make the first uncrewed flight for propulsion systems testing, launched into low Earth orbit atop a [[Saturn IB]]. This was originally planned for April 1967, to be followed by the first crewed flight later that year. But the LM's development problems had been underestimated, and LM-1's flight was delayed until January 22, 1968, as [[Apollo 5]]. At that time, LM-2 was held in reserve in case the LM-1 flight failed, which did not happen.\n\nLM-3 now became the first crewed LM, again to be flown in low Earth orbit to test all the systems, and practice the separation, rendezvous, and docking planned for Apollo 8 in December 1968. But again, last-minute problems delayed its flight until [[Apollo 9]] on March 3, 1969. A second, higher Earth orbit crewed practice flight had been planned to follow LM-3, but this was canceled to keep the program timeline on track.\n\n[[Apollo 10]] launched on May 18, 1969, using LM-4 for a \"dress rehearsal\" for the lunar landing, practicing all phases of the mission except powered descent initiation through takeoff.

Four days later, the Apollo 11 crew in the Command Module ''Columbia'' splashed down in the Pacific Ocean, completing [[Apollo Program#Background|President John F. Kennedy's goal]]: \"...before this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth\".\n\nThis was followed by landings by [[Apollo 12]] ''(Intrepid)'' and [[Apollo 14]] ''(Antares)''.[[File:Apollo 11 Lunar Module Eagle in landing configuration in lunar orbit from the Command and Service Module Columbia.jpg|thumb|The Apollo 11 lunar module ''Eagle'' in lunar orbit]]In April 1970, the [[Apollo 13]] lunar module ''Aquarius'' played an unexpected role in saving the lives of the three astronauts after an oxygen tank in the [[Apollo command and service module#Service module|service module]] ruptured, disabling the CSM. ''Aquarius'' served as a \"lifeboat\" for the astronauts during their return to Earth. Its [[Pintle injector|descent stage engine]]<ref>{{Cite book|last=|first=|title=REMEMBERING THE GIANTS - Apollo Rocket Propulsion Development - NASA|publisher=NASA|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=73-86}}</ref> was used to replace the crippled CSM Service Propulsion System engine, and its batteries supplied power for the trip home and recharged the Command Module's batteries critical for reentry. The astronauts splashed down safely on April 17, 1970. The LM's systems, designed to support two astronauts for 45 hours (including twice depressurization and repressurization causing loss of oxygen supply), actually stretched to support three astronauts for 90 hours (without depressurization and repressurization and loss of oxygen supply).\n\nHover times were maximized on the last four landing missions by using the Service Module engine to perform the initial descent orbit insertion burn 22 hours before the LM separated from the CSM, a practice begun on Apollo 14. This meant that the complete spacecraft, including the CSM, orbited the Moon with a {{convert|9.1|nmi|km|adj=on}} perilune, enabling the LM to begin its powered descent from that altitude with a full load of descent stage propellant, leaving more reserve propellant for the final approach.

Electrical storage batteries, cooling water, and breathing oxygen were stored in amounts sufficient for a lunar surface stay of 48 hours initially, extended to 75 hours for the later missions.\n\nDuring rest periods while parked on the Moon, the crew would sleep on hammocks slung crosswise in the cabin.\n\nThe return payload included the lunar rock and soil samples collected by the crew (as much as {{convert|238|lb|kg}} on Apollo 17), plus their exposed [[photographic film]].\n\n* Crew: 2\n* Crew cabin volume: {{convert|235|cuft|m3|abbr=on}}\n* Habitable volume: {{convert|160|cuft|m3|abbr=on}}\n* Crew compartment height: {{convert|7|ft|8|in|m|abbr=on}}\n* Crew compartment depth: {{convert|3|ft|6|in|m|abbr=on}}\n* Height: {{convert|9|ft|3.5|in|m|abbr=on}}\n* Width: {{convert|14|ft|1|in|m|abbr=on}}\n* Depth: {{convert|13|ft|3|in|m|abbr=on}}\n* Mass, dry: {{convert|4740|lb|kg|abbr=on}}\n* Mass, gross: {{convert|10300|lb|kg|abbr=on}}\n* Atmosphere: 100% oxygen at {{convert|4.8|psi|kPa|abbr=on}}\n* Water: two {{convert|42.5|lb|kg|adj=on|abbr=on}} storage tanks\n* Coolant: {{convert|25|lb|kg}} of [[ethylene glycol]] / water solution\n* Thermal Control: one active water-ice sublimator\n* RCS propellant mass: {{convert|633|lb|kg|abbr=on}}\n* RCS thrusters: sixteen x {{convert|100|lbf|N|abbr=on}} in four quads\n* RCS propellants: [[Aerozine 50]] fuel / [[Dinitrogen tetroxide|nitrogen tetroxide]] (N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>) oxidizer\n* RCS [[specific impulse]]: {{cvt|290|isp}}\n* APS propellant mass: {{convert|5,187|lb|kg|abbr=on}} stored in two {{convert|36|ft3|m3|adj=on|sigfig=3}} propellant tanks \n* APS engine: [[Bell Aircraft|Bell Aerospace]] [[Ascent Propulsion System|LM Ascent Engine]] (LMAE) and [[Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne|Rocketdyne]] LMAE Injectors\n* APS thrust: {{convert|3,500|lbf|N|abbr=on}} <!-- made consistent with infobox -->\n* APS propellants: Aerozine 50 fuel / nitrogen tetroxide oxidizer\n* APS pressurant: two {{convert|6.4|lb|kg|adj=on|abbr=on}} helium tanks at {{convert|3000|psi|MPa}}\n* APS [[specific impulse]]: {{cvt|311|isp}}\n* APS [[Delta-v|delta-V]]: {{convert|7,280|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}\n* [[Thrust-to-weight ratio]] at liftoff: 2.124 (in lunar gravity)\n* Batteries: two 28\u201332 volt, 296 [[ampere-hour]] [[Silver-zinc batteries]]; {{convert|125|lb|kg|abbr=on}} each\n* Power: 28 V DC, 115 V 400&nbsp;Hz AC\n\n===Descent stage===\n[[File:Scale model of the Apollo Lunar Module.jpg|thumb|Scale model of the Apollo Lunar Module at the [[Euro Space Center]] in Belgium]]\n[[File:Apollo 11 gold reverse.jpeg|thumb|The Lunar Module ''Eagle'' is portrayed on the 2019 United States [[Apollo 11 50th Anniversary commemorative coins (United States)|Apollo 11 50th Anniversary commemorative coins]]]]\nThe descent stage's primary job was to support a powered landing and surface extravehicular activity. When the excursion was over, it served as the launch pad for the ascent stage. Its octagonal shape was supported by four folding landing gear legs, and contained a [[throttle]]able [[Descent Propulsion System]] (DPS) engine with four [[hypergolic propellant]] tanks. A [[continuous-wave radar|continuous-wave]] [[Doppler radar]] antenna was mounted by the engine [[heat shield]] on the bottom surface, to send altitude and rate of descent data to the guidance system and pilot display during the landing. Almost all external surfaces, except for the top, platform, ladder, descent engine and heat shield, were covered in amber, dark (reddish) amber, black, silver, and yellow aluminized [[Kapton]] foil blankets for thermal insulation. The number 1 (front) landing leg had an attached platform (informally known as the \"porch\") in front of the ascent stage's EVA hatch and a ladder, which the astronauts used to ascend and descend between the cabin to the surface. The footpad of each landing leg incorporated a {{convert|67|in|m|adj=mid|-long}} surface contact sensor probe, which signaled the commander to switch off the descent engine. (The probe was omitted from the number 1 leg of every landing mission, to avoid a suit-puncture hazard to the astronauts, as the probes tended to break off and protrude upwards from the surface.)\n\nEquipment for the lunar exploration was carried in the Modular Equipment Stowage Assembly (MESA), a drawer mounted on a hinged panel dropping out of the lefthand forward compartment. Besides the astronaut's surface excavation tools and sample collection boxes, the MESA contained a television camera with a tripod; as the commander opened the MESA by pulling on a lanyard while descending the ladder, the camera was automatically activated to send the first pictures of the astronauts on the surface back to Earth. A [[Lunar Flag Assembly|United States flag]] for the astronauts to erect on the surface was carried in a container mounted on the ladder of each landing mission.\n\nThe Early Apollo Surface Experiments Package (EASEP) (later the [[Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package]] (ALSEP)), was carried in the opposite compartment behind the LM. An external compartment on the right front panel carried a deployable S-band antenna which, when opened looked like an inverted umbrella on a tripod. This was not used on the first landing due to time constraints, and the fact that acceptable communications were being received using the LM's S-band antenna, but was used on Apollo 12 and 14. A hand-pulled [[Modular Equipment Transporter]] (MET), similar in appearance to a golf cart, was carried on Apollo 13 and 14 to facilitate carrying the tools and samples on extended moonwalks. On the extended missions ([[Apollo 15]] and later), the antenna and TV camera were mounted on the [[Lunar Roving Vehicle]], which was carried folded up and mounted on an external panel. Compartments also contained replacement [[Primary Life Support System|Portable Life Support System]] (PLSS) batteries and extra lithium hydroxide canisters on the extended missions.\n\n* Height: {{convert|10|ft|7.2|in|m|abbr=on}} (plus {{convert|5|ft|7.2|in|m|abbr=on}} landing probes)\n* Width/depth, minus landing gear: {{convert|13|ft|10|in|m|abbr=on}}\n* Width/depth, landing gear extended: {{convert|31.0|ft|m|abbr=on}}\n* Mass including propellant: {{convert|22,783|lb|kg|abbr=on}}\n* Water: one {{convert|151|kg|lb|adj=on|abbr=on}} storage tank\n* DPS propellant mass: {{convert|18,000|lb|kg|abbr=on}} stored in four {{convert|67.3|ft3|m3|adj=on|sigfig=4}} propellant tanks\n* DPS engine: [[TRW Inc.|TRW]] [[Descent Propulsion System|LM descent engine (LMDE)]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.astronautix.com/engines/tr201.htm |title=TR-201 for Delta rocket second stage derived from LMDE |date=1972 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706190928/http://astronautix.com/engines/tr201.htm |archivedate=2008-07-06 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=|first=|title=REMEMBERING THE GIANTS - Apollo Rocket Propulsion Development - NASA|publisher=NASA|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=73-86}}</ref>\n* DPS thrust: {{convert|10,125|lbf|N|abbr=on}}, throttleable between 10% and 60% of full thrust\n* DPS propellants: Aerozine 50 fuel / nitrogen tetroxide oxidizer\n* DPS pressurant: one {{convert|49|lb|kg|adj=on}} supercritical helium tank at {{convert|1555|psi|MPa|abbr=on}}\n* DPS [[specific impulse]]: 311 s (3,050 N\u22c5s/kg)\n* DPS [[Delta-v|delta-V]]: {{convert|8,100|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}\n* Batteries: four (Apollo 9-14) or five (Apollo 15-17) 28\u201332 V, 415 A\u22c5h silver-zinc batteries; {{convert|135|lb|kg|abbr=on}} each\n\n==Lunar modules produced==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

This would have been launched on an uncrewed Saturn 1B, and docked with a crewed [[Apollo command and service module|command and service module]], named the Apollo Telescope Mission (ATM).\n\nThis idea was later transferred to the original [[wet workshop]] design for the ''[[Skylab]]'' orbital workshop and renamed the [[Apollo Telescope Mount]] to be docked on a side port of the workshop's multiple docking adapter (MDA). When Skylab changed to a \"dry workshop\" design pre-fabricated on the ground and launched on a Saturn V, the telescope was mounted on a hinged arm and controlled from inside the MDA. Only the octagonal shape of the telescope container, solar panels and the Apollo Telescope Mount name were kept, though there was no longer any association with the LM.\n\n===LM Truck===\nThe Apollo LM Truck (also known as Lunar Payload Module) was a stand-alone LM descent stage intended to deliver up to {{convert|11000|lb|t}} of payload to the Moon for an uncrewed landing. This technique was intended to deliver equipment and supplies to a permanent crewed [[lunar base]]. As originally proposed, it would be launched on a Saturn V with a full Apollo crew to accompany it to lunar orbit and guide it to a landing next to the base; then the base crew would unload the \"truck\" while the orbiting crew returned to Earth.<ref>[http://www.astronautix.com/craft/apotruck.htm Apollo LM Truck on Mark Wade's Encyclopedia Astronautica] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051215210907/http://www.astronautix.com/craft/apotruck.htm |date=2005-12-15 }} \u2013 Description of adapted LM descent stage for the uncrewed transport of cargo to a permanent lunar base.</ref> In later AAP plans, the LPM would have been delivered by an uncrewed lunar ferry vehicle.\n\n==Depiction in film and television==\nThe 1995 Ron Howard film ''[[Apollo 13 (film)|Apollo 13]]'', a dramatization of that mission starring [[Tom Hanks]], [[Kevin Bacon]], and [[Bill Paxton]], was filmed using realistic spacecraft interior reconstructions of the ''Aquarius'' and the Command Module ''Odyssey''.\n\nThe development and construction of the lunar module is dramatized in the 1998 miniseries ''[[From the Earth to the Moon (miniseries)|From the Earth to the Moon]]'' episode entitled [[From the Earth to the Moon (miniseries)#Episodes|\"Spider\"]]. This is in reference to LM-3, used on Apollo 9, which the crew named ''Spider'' after its spidery appearance. The unused LM-13 stood in during the teleplay to depict LM-3 and LM-5, ''Eagle'', used by Apollo 11.\n\n==Media==\n<gallery widths=\"350px\" heights=\"110px\" perrow=\"2\">\nFile:Lunar Module Equipment Locations 1 of 2.jpg|Equipment location plans (1 of 2)\nFile:Lunar Module Equipment Locations 2 of 2.jpg|Equipment location plans (2 of 2)\nFile:Lunar Module Control Displays.jpg|Controls plans\nFile:Lunar Module Landing Gear plans.jpg|Landing Gear plans\n</gallery>\n<gallery widths=\"350px\" heights=\"350px\" perrow=\"2\">\nFile:Apollo 15 landing on the Moon.ogg|[[Apollo 15]] landing on the Moon seen from the perspective of the Lunar Module Pilot.

It was the first crewed spacecraft to operate exclusively in the airless vacuum of space, and remains the only crewed vehicle to land anywhere beyond Earth.\n\nStructurally and aerodynamically incapable of flight through Earth's atmosphere, the two-stage lunar module was ferried to lunar orbit attached to the [[Apollo command and service module]] (CSM), about twice its mass. Its crew of two flew the complete lunar module from lunar orbit to the Moon's surface.  During takeoff, the spent descent stage was used as a launch pad for the ascent stage which then [[Lunar orbit rendezvous|flew back to the command module]], after which it was also discarded.\n\nOverseen by [[Grumman Aircraft]], the LM's development was plagued with problems that delayed its first uncrewed flight by about ten months and its first crewed flight by about three months. Still, the LM became the most reliable component of the Apollo/Saturn [[space vehicle]].<ref>''Moon Race: The History of Apollo'' DVD, Columbia River Entertainment (Portland, Oregon, 2007)</ref>  The total cost of the LM for development and the units produced was $21.3&nbsp;billion in 2016 dollars, adjusting from a nominal total of $2.2&nbsp;billion<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://georgetyson.com/files/apollostatistics.pdf|title=Apollo by the Numbers|last=Orloff|first=Richard|publisher=[[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]]|year=1996|isbn=|location=|page=22}}</ref> using the NASA New Start Inflation Indices.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/files/2013_NNSI_FY14(1).xlsx|title=NASA New Start Inflation Indices|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=National Aeronautics and Space Administration|access-date=May 23, 2016}}</ref>\n\nTen lunar modules were launched into space. Of these, six landed humans on the Moon from 1969 to 1972. The first two launched were test flights in [[low Earth orbit]]\u2014the first without a crew, the second with one. Another was used by [[Apollo 10]] for a dress rehearsal flight in low lunar orbit, without landing. One lunar module functioned as a lifeboat for the crew of [[Apollo 13]], providing life support and propulsion when their CSM was disabled by an oxygen tank explosion en route to the Moon, forcing the crew to abandon plans for landing.\n\nThe six landed descent stages remain at their landing sites; their corresponding ascent stages crashed into the Moon following use. One ascent stage (Apollo 10's ''Snoopy'') was discarded in a [[heliocentric orbit]] after its descent stage was discarded in lunar orbit.  The other three LMs were burned up in the Earth's atmosphere: the four stages of [[Apollo 5]] and [[Apollo 9]] each re-entered separately, while Apollo 13's ''Aquarius'' re-entered complete, following emergency maneuvers.\n\n==Operational profile==\nAt launch, the lunar module sat directly beneath the [[Apollo command and service module|command and service module]] (CSM) with legs folded, inside the [[Apollo (spacecraft)#Spacecraft\u2013lunar module adapter (SLA)|Spacecraft-to-LM adapter (SLA)]] attached to the [[S-IVB]] third stage of the [[Saturn V]] rocket. There it remained through Earth parking orbit and the [[trans-lunar injection]] (TLI) rocket burn to send the craft toward the Moon.\n\nSoon after TLI, the SLA opened; the CSM separated, turned around, came back to dock with the lunar module, and extracted it from the S-IVB. During the flight to the Moon, the docking hatches were opened and the lunar module pilot entered the LM to temporarily power up and test all systems except propulsion. The lunar module pilot performed the role of an engineering officer, monitoring the systems of both spacecraft.\n\nAfter achieving a lunar parking orbit, the commander and LM pilot entered and powered up the LM, replaced the hatches and docking equipment, unfolded and locked its landing legs, and separated from the CSM, flying independently. The commander operated the flight controls and engine throttle, while the lunar module pilot operated other spacecraft systems and kept the commander informed about systems status and navigational information. After the command module pilot visually inspected the [[Landing gear (spaceflight)|landing gear]], the LM was withdrawn to a safe distance, then rotated until the [[Descent propulsion system|descent engine]] was pointed forward into the direction of travel. A 30-second descent orbit insertion burn was performed to reduce speed and drop the LM's [[perilune]] to within about {{convert|50000|ft|km}} of the surface,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4029/Apollo_11g_Lunar_Orbit_Phase.htm|title=Apollo 11 Lunar Orbit Phase|publisher=}}</ref> about {{convert|260|nmi|km}} uprange of the landing site.\n\n[[File:Earth, Moon and Lunar Module, AS11-44-6643.jpg|thumb|''Eagle'', the lunar module ascent stage of [[Apollo 11]], in orbit above the Moon. Earth is visible in the distance. Photograph by [[Michael Collins (astronaut)|Michael Collins]].]]\n\nAs the craft approached perilune, the [[Pintle injector|descent engine]] was started again to begin powered descent. During this time, the crew flew on their backs, depending on the computer to slow the craft's forward and vertical velocity to near zero. Control was exercised with a combination of engine throttling and attitude thrusters, guided by the computer with the aid of landing radar. During braking, the LM descended to about {{convert|10000|ft|km}}, then, in the final approach phase, down to about {{convert|700|ft|m}}. During final approach, the vehicle pitched over to a near-vertical position, allowing the crew to look forward and down to see the lunar surface for the first time.<ref>\n{{cite book\n| last = Gatland\n| first = Kenneth\n| title = Manned Spacecraft, Second Revision\n| publisher = Macmillan Publishing Co.\n| location = New York\n| year = 1976\n| pages = 194\u2013196\n| isbn = 0-02-542820-9 }}\n</ref>\n\nAstronauts flew Apollo spacecraft manually only during the lunar approach.<ref name=\"agle199809\">{{Cite magazine |last=Agle |first=D.C. |date=September 1998 |title=Flying the Gusmobile |url=https://www.airspacemag.com/flight-today/flying-the-gusmobile-218187/ |magazine=Air & Space |language=en |access-date=2018-12-15}}</ref> The final landing phase began about {{convert|2000|ft|km}} uprange of the targeted landing site. At this point, manual control was enabled for the commander, who had enough [[liquid rocket propellant|propellant]] to hover for up to two minutes to survey where the computer was taking the craft and make any necessary corrections. If necessary, landing could have been aborted at almost any time by jettisoning the descent stage and firing the ascent engine to climb back into orbit for an emergency return to the CSM. Finally, one or more of three {{convert|67.2|in|m|adj=on}} probes extending from footpads on the legs of the lander touched the surface, activating the contact indicator light which signaled the commander to manually shut off the descent engine, allowing the LM to settle onto the surface. On touchdown, the probes would be bent as much as 180 degrees, or even break off. The original design used the probes on all four legs, but starting with the first landing (LM-5 on Apollo 11), the one at the ladder was removed out of concern that the bent probe after landing might puncture an astronaut's suit as he descended or stepped off the ladder.\n\nThe original [[extravehicular activity]] (EVA) plan, up through at least 1966, was for only one astronaut to leave the LM while the other remained inside \"to maintain communications\".<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6UuRCwsGugg&t=3m20s Landing on the Moon], 1966 episode of MIT's ''Science Reporter'' (posted to YouTube by MIT on Jan 20, 2016)<br />Quote:<br />\"While one astronaut explores the area around the LEM, the second remains inside to maintain communications.\"</ref> Communications were eventually deemed to be reliable enough to allow both crew members to walk on the surface, leaving the spacecraft to be only remotely attended by Mission Control.\n\nBeginning with [[Apollo 14]], extra LM propellant was made available for the powered descent and landing, by using the CSM engine to achieve the {{convert|50000|ft|km|adj=on}} perilune. After the spacecraft undocked, the CSM raised and circularized its orbit for the remainder of the mission.\n\nWhen ready to leave the Moon, the LM's ascent engine fired, leaving the descent stage on the Moon's surface. After a few course correction burns, the LM rendezvoused with the CSM and docked to transfer the crew and rock samples. Having completed its job, the ascent stage was separated. The Apollo 10 ascent stage engine was fired until its fuel was used up, sending it past the Moon into a [[heliocentric orbit]].<ref name=\"nasa_apollo10\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/apollo/missions/apollo10.html |title=Apollo 10 |editor-last=Ryba |editor-first=Jeanne |publisher=NASA |accessdate=June 26, 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"disposition\">{{cite web|title=Current locations of the Apollo Command Module Capsules (and Lunar Module crash sites)|url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/lunar/apolloloc.html|website=Apollo: Where are they now?|publisher=NASA|accessdate=27 December 2014}}</ref> The [[Apollo 11]] ascent stage was left in lunar orbit to eventually crash; all subsequent ascent stages (except for Apollo 13) were intentionally steered into the Moon to obtain readings from seismometers placed on the surface.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Joseph Francis Shea.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A 1962 model of the first LEM design, docked to the command and service module. The model is held by [[Joseph Francis Shea|Joseph Shea]], the key engineer behind the adoption of [[lunar orbit rendezvous]] mission logistics.]]\nThe lunar module (originally designated the lunar excursion module, known by the [[Acronym and initialism|acronym]] LEM) was designed after NASA [[Project Apollo#Choosing a mission mode|chose to reach the Moon]] via [[Lunar Orbit Rendezvous]] (LOR) instead of the [[direct ascent]] or [[Earth Orbit Rendezvous]] (EOR) methods. Both direct ascent and EOR would have involved landing a much heavier, complete Apollo spacecraft on the Moon. Once the decision had been made to proceed using LOR, it became necessary to produce a separate craft capable of reaching the lunar surface and ascending back to lunar orbit.\n\n===Contract letting===\nIn July 1962, eleven firms were invited to submit proposals for the LEM. Nine companies responded in September, answering 20 questions posed by the NASA RFP in a 60-page limited technical proposal. [[Grumman Aircraft]] was awarded the contract two months later. Grumman had begun lunar orbit rendezvous studies in the late 1950s and again in 1961. The contract cost was expected to be around $350&nbsp;million. There were initially four major subcontractors: [[Bell Aerosystems]] ([[Ascent Propulsion System|ascent engine]]), [[Hamilton Standard]] (environmental control systems), [[Marquardt Corporation|Marquardt]] (reaction control system) and [[TRW Inc.|TRW's]] [[Space Technology Laboratories]] ([[Descent Propulsion System|descent engine]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4205/ch6-5.html |title=Chariots for Apollo: A History of Manned Lunar Spacecraft; Engines, Large and Small |author1=Courtney G.

A backup navigation tool, the [[Apollo Abort Guidance System|Abort Guidance System]] (AGS), was developed by TRW.\n\n===Design phase===\n[[File:Lunar Lander Model.jpg|thumb|This 1963 model depicts the second LEM design, which gave rise to informal references as \"the bug\".]]\nThe Apollo Lunar Module was chiefly designed by Grumman aerospace engineer [[Thomas J.

The second design invoked the idea of a helicopter cockpit with large curved windows and seats, to improve the astronauts' visibility for hover and landing. This also included a second, forward docking port, allowing the LEM crew to take an active role in docking with the CSM.\n\nAs the program continued, there were numerous redesigns to save weight, improve safety, and fix problems. First to go were the heavy cockpit windows and the seats; the astronauts would stand while flying the LEM, supported by a cable and pulley system, with smaller triangular windows giving them sufficient visibility of the landing site. Later, the redundant forward docking port was removed, which meant the Command Pilot gave up active control of the docking to the Command Module Pilot; he could still see the approaching CSM through a small overhead window. Egress while wearing bulky [[Extra-vehicular activity|Extra-Vehicular Activity]] (EVA) spacesuits was eased by a simpler forward hatch (32 x 32 inches).\n\nThe configuration was frozen in April 1963, when the ascent and descent engine designs were decided. In addition to Rocketdyne, a parallel program for the '''descent engine'''<ref>{{Cite book|last=|first=|url=https://history.nasa.gov/monograph45.pdf|title=REMEMBERING THE GIANTS - Apollo Rocket Propulsion Development - NASA|publisher=NASA|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=73-86}}</ref> was ordered from [[TRW Inc.#Space exploration|Space Technology Laboratories (TRW)]] in July 1963, and by January 1965 the Rocketdyne contract was canceled.\n\nPower was initially to be produced by [[fuel cell]]s built by [[Pratt and Whitney]] similar to the CSM, but in March 1965 these were discarded in favor of an all-battery design.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/craft/lmerical.htm|title=LM Electrical|publisher=[[Encyclopedia Astronautica]]|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100201084039/http://astronautix.com/craft/lmerical.htm|archivedate=2010-02-01}}</ref>\n<!-- {{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} -->\n\nThe initial design had three landing legs, the lightest possible configuration. But as any particular leg would have to carry the weight of the vehicle if it landed at a significant angle, this was also the least stable configuration if one of the legs were damaged during landing. The next landing gear design iteration had five legs and was the most stable configuration for landing on an unknown terrain. That configuration, however, was too heavy and the designers compromised on four landing legs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/craft/lmlggear.htm|title=LM Landing Gear|publisher=Encyclopedia Astronautica|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100201083530/http://astronautix.com/craft/lmlggear.htm|archivedate=2010-02-01}}</ref>\n<!-- {{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} -->\n\nIn June 1966, the name was changed to lunar module (LM), eliminating the word \"excursion\".<ref>{{cite web |title=SP-4402 Origins of NASA Names |url=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4402/ch4.htm |website=NASA History |publisher=NASA |accessdate=January 16, 2015}}</ref><ref>Scheer, Julian W.

Successful testing of two LLRV prototypes at the [[Dryden Flight Research Center]] led in 1966 to three production Lunar Landing Training Vehicles (LLTV) which along with the LLRV's were used to train the astronauts at the Houston Manned Spacecraft Center. This aircraft proved fairly dangerous to fly, as three of the five were destroyed in crashes. It was equipped with a rocket-powered ejection seat, so in each case the pilot survived, including the first man to walk on the Moon, [[Neil Armstrong]].<ref name=\"ugly\">{{cite web|url=https://history.nasa.gov/alsj/alsj-LLRV.html|title=LLRV Monograph|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===Development flights===\n[[File:67-H-1230 Lunar module LTA-2 R.jpg|thumb|The [[Apollo 6]] Lunar Module Test Article (LTA-2R) shortly before being mated with the SLA]]\n\nLM-1 was built to make the first uncrewed flight for propulsion systems testing, launched into low Earth orbit atop a [[Saturn IB]]. This was originally planned for April 1967, to be followed by the first crewed flight later that year. But the LM's development problems had been underestimated, and LM-1's flight was delayed until January 22, 1968, as [[Apollo 5]]. At that time, LM-2 was held in reserve in case the LM-1 flight failed, which did not happen.\n\nLM-3 now became the first crewed LM, again to be flown in low Earth orbit to test all the systems, and practice the separation, rendezvous, and docking planned for Apollo 8 in December 1968. But again, last-minute problems delayed its flight until [[Apollo 9]] on March 3, 1969. A second, higher Earth orbit crewed practice flight had been planned to follow LM-3, but this was canceled to keep the program timeline on track.\n\n[[Apollo 10]] launched on May 18, 1969, using LM-4 for a \"dress rehearsal\" for the lunar landing, practicing all phases of the mission except powered descent initiation through takeoff. The LM descended to {{convert|47400|ft|mi km|1}} above the lunar surface, then jettisoned the descent stage and used its ascent engine to return to the CSM.<ref name='chariots11-2'>{{cite book|url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4205/contents.html|title=Chariots for Apollo: A History of Manned Lunar Spacecraft|author1=Courtney G.

Four days later, the Apollo 11 crew in the Command Module ''Columbia'' splashed down in the Pacific Ocean, completing [[Apollo Program#Background|President John F. Kennedy's goal]]: \"...before this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth\".\n\nThis was followed by landings by [[Apollo 12]] ''(Intrepid)'' and [[Apollo 14]] ''(Antares)''.[[File:Apollo 11 Lunar Module Eagle in landing configuration in lunar orbit from the Command and Service Module Columbia.jpg|thumb|The Apollo 11 lunar module ''Eagle'' in lunar orbit]]In April 1970, the [[Apollo 13]] lunar module ''Aquarius'' played an unexpected role in saving the lives of the three astronauts after an oxygen tank in the [[Apollo command and service module#Service module|service module]] ruptured, disabling the CSM. ''Aquarius'' served as a \"lifeboat\" for the astronauts during their return to Earth. Its [[Descent Propulsion System|descent stage engine]] was used to replace the crippled CSM Service Propulsion System engine, and its batteries supplied power for the trip home and recharged the Command Module's batteries critical for reentry. The astronauts splashed down safely on April 17, 1970. The LM's systems, designed to support two astronauts for 45 hours (including twice depressurization and repressurization causing loss of oxygen supply), actually stretched to support three astronauts for 90 hours (without depressurization and repressurization and loss of oxygen supply).\n\nHover times were maximized on the last four landing missions by using the Service Module engine to perform the initial descent orbit insertion burn 22 hours before the LM separated from the CSM, a practice begun on Apollo 14. This meant that the complete spacecraft, including the CSM, orbited the Moon with a {{convert|9.1|nmi|km|adj=on}} perilune, enabling the LM to begin its powered descent from that altitude with a full load of descent stage propellant, leaving more reserve propellant for the final approach.

A forward EVA hatch provided access to and from the lunar surface, while an overhead hatch and docking port provided access to and from the Command Module.\n\nInternal equipment included an environmental control (life support) system; a VHF communications system with two antennas for communication with the Command Module; a [[unified S-band]] system and steerable [[parabolic antenna|parabolic dish antenna]] for communication with Earth; an EVA antenna resembling a miniature parasol which relayed communications from antennas on the astronauts' [[Primary life support system|Portable Life Support System]]s through the LM; [[Apollo PGNCS|primary (PGNCS)]] and [[Apollo Abort Guidance System|backup (AGS)]] guidance and navigation systems; an [[Apollo PGNCS#Optical unit|Alignment Optical Telescope]] for visually determining the spacecraft orientation; rendezvous radar with its own steerable dish antenna; and an system for active thermal control. Electrical storage batteries, cooling water, and breathing oxygen were stored in amounts sufficient for a lunar surface stay of 48 hours initially, extended to 75 hours for the later missions.\n\nDuring rest periods while parked on the Moon, the crew would sleep on hammocks slung crosswise in the cabin.\n\nThe return payload included the lunar rock and soil samples collected by the crew (as much as {{convert|238|lb|kg}} on Apollo 17), plus their exposed [[photographic film]].\n\n* Crew: 2\n* Crew cabin volume: {{convert|235|cuft|m3|abbr=on}}\n* Habitable volume: {{convert|160|cuft|m3|abbr=on}}\n* Crew compartment height: {{convert|7|ft|8|in|m|abbr=on}}\n* Crew compartment depth: {{convert|3|ft|6|in|m|abbr=on}}\n* Height: {{convert|9|ft|3.5|in|m|abbr=on}}\n* Width: {{convert|14|ft|1|in|m|abbr=on}}\n* Depth: {{convert|13|ft|3|in|m|abbr=on}}\n* Mass, dry: {{convert|4740|lb|kg|abbr=on}}\n* Mass, gross: {{convert|10300|lb|kg|abbr=on}}\n* Atmosphere: 100% oxygen at {{convert|4.8|psi|kPa|abbr=on}}\n* Water: two {{convert|42.5|lb|kg|adj=on|abbr=on}} storage tanks\n* Coolant: {{convert|25|lb|kg}} of [[ethylene glycol]] / water solution\n* Thermal Control: one active water-ice sublimator\n* RCS propellant mass: {{convert|633|lb|kg|abbr=on}}\n* RCS thrusters: sixteen x {{convert|100|lbf|N|abbr=on}} in four quads\n* RCS propellants: [[Aerozine 50]] fuel / [[Dinitrogen tetroxide|nitrogen tetroxide]] (N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>) oxidizer\n* RCS [[specific impulse]]: {{cvt|290|isp}}\n* APS propellant mass: {{convert|5,187|lb|kg|abbr=on}} stored in two {{convert|36|ft3|m3|adj=on|sigfig=3}} propellant tanks \n* APS engine: [[Bell Aircraft|Bell Aerospace]] [[Ascent Propulsion System|LM Ascent Engine]] (LMAE) and [[Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne|Rocketdyne]] LMAE Injectors\n* APS thrust: {{convert|3,500|lbf|N|abbr=on}} <!-- made consistent with infobox -->\n* APS propellants: Aerozine 50 fuel / nitrogen tetroxide oxidizer\n* APS pressurant: two {{convert|6.4|lb|kg|adj=on|abbr=on}} helium tanks at {{convert|3000|psi|MPa}}\n* APS [[specific impulse]]: {{cvt|311|isp}}\n* APS [[Delta-v|delta-V]]: {{convert|7,280|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}\n* [[Thrust-to-weight ratio]] at liftoff: 2.124 (in lunar gravity)\n* Batteries: two 28\u201332 volt, 296 [[ampere-hour]] [[Silver-zinc batteries]]; {{convert|125|lb|kg|abbr=on}} each\n* Power: 28 V DC, 115 V 400&nbsp;Hz AC\n\n===Descent stage===\n[[File:Scale model of the Apollo Lunar Module.jpg|thumb|Scale model of the Apollo Lunar Module at the [[Euro Space Center]] in Belgium]]\n[[File:Apollo 11 gold reverse.jpeg|thumb|The Lunar Module ''Eagle'' is portrayed on the 2019 United States [[Apollo 11 50th Anniversary commemorative coins (United States)|Apollo 11 50th Anniversary commemorative coins]]]]\nThe descent stage's primary job was to support a powered landing and surface extravehicular activity. When the excursion was over, it served as the launch pad for the ascent stage. Its octagonal shape was supported by four folding landing gear legs, and contained a [[throttle]]able [[Descent Propulsion System]] (DPS) engine with four [[hypergolic propellant]] tanks. A [[continuous-wave radar|continuous-wave]] [[Doppler radar]] antenna was mounted by the engine [[heat shield]] on the bottom surface, to send altitude and rate of descent data to the guidance system and pilot display during the landing. Almost all external surfaces, except for the top, platform, ladder, descent engine and heat shield, were covered in amber, dark (reddish) amber, black, silver, and yellow aluminized [[Kapton]] foil blankets for thermal insulation. The number 1 (front) landing leg had an attached platform (informally known as the \"porch\") in front of the ascent stage's EVA hatch and a ladder, which the astronauts used to ascend and descend between the cabin to the surface. The footpad of each landing leg incorporated a {{convert|67|in|m|adj=mid|-long}} surface contact sensor probe, which signaled the commander to switch off the descent engine. (The probe was omitted from the number 1 leg of every landing mission, to avoid a suit-puncture hazard to the astronauts, as the probes tended to break off and protrude upwards from the surface.)\n\nEquipment for the lunar exploration was carried in the Modular Equipment Stowage Assembly (MESA), a drawer mounted on a hinged panel dropping out of the lefthand forward compartment. Besides the astronaut's surface excavation tools and sample collection boxes, the MESA contained a television camera with a tripod; as the commander opened the MESA by pulling on a lanyard while descending the ladder, the camera was automatically activated to send the first pictures of the astronauts on the surface back to Earth. A [[Lunar Flag Assembly|United States flag]] for the astronauts to erect on the surface was carried in a container mounted on the ladder of each landing mission.\n\nThe Early Apollo Surface Experiments Package (EASEP) (later the [[Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package]] (ALSEP)), was carried in the opposite compartment behind the LM. An external compartment on the right front panel carried a deployable S-band antenna which, when opened looked like an inverted umbrella on a tripod. This was not used on the first landing due to time constraints, and the fact that acceptable communications were being received using the LM's S-band antenna, but was used on Apollo 12 and 14. A hand-pulled [[Modular Equipment Transporter]] (MET), similar in appearance to a golf cart, was carried on Apollo 13 and 14 to facilitate carrying the tools and samples on extended moonwalks. On the extended missions ([[Apollo 15]] and later), the antenna and TV camera were mounted on the [[Lunar Roving Vehicle]], which was carried folded up and mounted on an external panel. Compartments also contained replacement [[Primary Life Support System|Portable Life Support System]] (PLSS) batteries and extra lithium hydroxide canisters on the extended missions.\n\n* Height: {{convert|10|ft|7.2|in|m|abbr=on}} (plus {{convert|5|ft|7.2|in|m|abbr=on}} landing probes)\n* Width/depth, minus landing gear: {{convert|13|ft|10|in|m|abbr=on}}\n* Width/depth, landing gear extended: {{convert|31.0|ft|m|abbr=on}}\n* Mass including propellant: {{convert|22,783|lb|kg|abbr=on}}\n* Water: one {{convert|151|kg|lb|adj=on|abbr=on}} storage tank\n* DPS propellant mass: {{convert|18,000|lb|kg|abbr=on}} stored in four {{convert|67.3|ft3|m3|adj=on|sigfig=4}} propellant tanks\n* DPS engine: [[TRW Inc.|TRW]] [[Descent Propulsion System|LM descent engine (LMDE)]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.astronautix.com/engines/tr201.htm |title=TR-201 for Delta rocket second stage derived from LMDE |date=1972 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706190928/http://astronautix.com/engines/tr201.htm |archivedate=2008-07-06 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=|first=|title=REMEMBERING THE GIANTS - Apollo Rocket Propulsion Development - NASA|publisher=NASA|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=73-86}}</ref>\n* DPS thrust: {{convert|10,125|lbf|N|abbr=on}}, throttleable between 10% and 60% of full thrust\n* DPS propellants: Aerozine 50 fuel / nitrogen tetroxide oxidizer\n* DPS pressurant: one {{convert|49|lb|kg|adj=on}} supercritical helium tank at {{convert|1555|psi|MPa|abbr=on}}\n* DPS [[specific impulse]]: 311 s (3,050 N\u22c5s/kg)\n* DPS [[Delta-v|delta-V]]: {{convert|8,100|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}\n* Batteries: four (Apollo 9-14) or five (Apollo 15-17) 28\u201332 V, 415 A\u22c5h silver-zinc batteries; {{convert|135|lb|kg|abbr=on}} each\n\n==Lunar modules produced==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

This would have been launched on an uncrewed Saturn 1B, and docked with a crewed [[Apollo command and service module|command and service module]], named the Apollo Telescope Mission (ATM).\n\nThis idea was later transferred to the original [[wet workshop]] design for the ''[[Skylab]]'' orbital workshop and renamed the [[Apollo Telescope Mount]] to be docked on a side port of the workshop's multiple docking adapter (MDA). When Skylab changed to a \"dry workshop\" design pre-fabricated on the ground and launched on a Saturn V, the telescope was mounted on a hinged arm and controlled from inside the MDA. Only the octagonal shape of the telescope container, solar panels and the Apollo Telescope Mount name were kept, though there was no longer any association with the LM.\n\n===LM Truck===\nThe Apollo LM Truck (also known as Lunar Payload Module) was a stand-alone LM descent stage intended to deliver up to {{convert|11000|lb|t}} of payload to the Moon for an uncrewed landing. This technique was intended to deliver equipment and supplies to a permanent crewed [[lunar base]]. As originally proposed, it would be launched on a Saturn V with a full Apollo crew to accompany it to lunar orbit and guide it to a landing next to the base; then the base crew would unload the \"truck\" while the orbiting crew returned to Earth.<ref>[http://www.astronautix.com/craft/apotruck.htm Apollo LM Truck on Mark Wade's Encyclopedia Astronautica] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051215210907/http://www.astronautix.com/craft/apotruck.htm |date=2005-12-15 }} \u2013 Description of adapted LM descent stage for the uncrewed transport of cargo to a permanent lunar base.</ref> In later AAP plans, the LPM would have been delivered by an uncrewed lunar ferry vehicle.\n\n==Depiction in film and television==\nThe 1995 Ron Howard film ''[[Apollo 13 (film)|Apollo 13]]'', a dramatization of that mission starring [[Tom Hanks]], [[Kevin Bacon]], and [[Bill Paxton]], was filmed using realistic spacecraft interior reconstructions of the ''Aquarius'' and the Command Module ''Odyssey''.\n\nThe development and construction of the lunar module is dramatized in the 1998 miniseries ''[[From the Earth to the Moon (miniseries)|From the Earth to the Moon]]'' episode entitled [[From the Earth to the Moon (miniseries)#Episodes|\"Spider\"]]. This is in reference to LM-3, used on Apollo 9, which the crew named ''Spider'' after its spidery appearance. The unused LM-13 stood in during the teleplay to depict LM-3 and LM-5, ''Eagle'', used by Apollo 11.\n\n==Media==\n<gallery widths=\"350px\" heights=\"110px\" perrow=\"2\">\nFile:Lunar Module Equipment Locations 1 of 2.jpg|Equipment location plans (1 of 2)\nFile:Lunar Module Equipment Locations 2 of 2.jpg|Equipment location plans (2 of 2)\nFile:Lunar Module Control Displays.jpg|Controls plans\nFile:Lunar Module Landing Gear plans.jpg|Landing Gear plans\n</gallery>\n<gallery widths=\"350px\" heights=\"350px\" perrow=\"2\">\nFile:Apollo 15 landing on the Moon.ogg|[[Apollo 15]] landing on the Moon seen from the perspective of the Lunar Module Pilot.

In 1946 General Arnold directed Dr. [[Theodore von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n]] the [[RAND Corporation]] to determine the feasibility of a satellite for strategic reconnaissance. In 1946 this study identified nearly all current space mission areas, including intelligence, weather forecasting, communications, and navigation.<ref name=\"auto1\">{{cite web|url=https://media.defense.gov/2010/Oct/01/2001329745/-1/-1/0/AFD-101001-060.pdf|title=The U.S. Air Force in Space 1945 to the Twenty-first Century|publisher=USAF History and Museums Program, United States Air Force|place=Washington, D.C.|date=1998}}</ref>\n\n[[File:General Bernard A Schriever.jpg|thumb|General [[Bernard Schriever]] was the father of the military space program.]]\nAfter the [[United States Air Force]] gained its independence in 1947, General [[Bernard Schriever]] was appointed to head the [[Western Development Division]], made responsible for the Air Force's space and intercontinental ballistic missile programs. It was responsible for developing the Advanced Reconnaissance System, which would have been the Air Force's first satellite constellation. On 4 October 1957 the [[Soviet Union]] launched [[Sputnik 1]], which was the world's first satellite. This event transformed space development overnight, helping the national security establishment understand the importance of the space domain.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nEarly military space development was marked by strong interservice rivalry, with each developing their own proposals for satellites and launch vehicles. The first American satellite was the [[Army Ballistic Missile Agency]]'s [[Explorer 1]] which was launched on the [[Naval Research Laboratory]]'s [[Vanguard (rocket)|Vanguard]] rocket. The Air Force still continued military space development amidst this competition from the Army and Navy. In 1958 the newly formed [[DARPA|Advanced Research Projects Agency]] assumed control over all military space programs, but this centralization was short lived and in gave control back to the services in September 1959. The creation of [[NASA]] in 1958 significantly hampered the Army and Navy's space programs, absorbing the Army's [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] and [[Army Ballistic Missile Agency]] and Navy's [[Project Vanguard]] and [[Minitrack]] satellite tracking network, but only absorbed the Air Force's [[Man in Space Soonest]] program, merging it with [[Project Mercury]].<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nDevelopment of Air Force space systems continued with the [[Missile Defense Alarm System]] (MIDAS) and [[Strategic Air Command]]'s [[Samos (satellite)|SAMOS]] reconnaissance satellites, as well as the [[Thor (rocket family)|Thor]], [[Atlas (rocket family)|Atlas]], and [[Titan (rocket family)|Titan]] space launch vehicles. The Air Force and [[Central Intelligence Agency]] also jointly developed and operated the [[Corona (satellite)|Corona]] reconnaissance satellite. The development of reconnaissance satellites became a national priority after an American [[Lockheed U-2|U-2]] reconnaissance plane was [[1960 U-2 incident|shot down]] over the Soviet Union, making aerial reconnaissance impractical. In 1961 the [[National Reconnaissance Office]] was created as a joint Air Force\u2013CIA activity to manage all spy satellites.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n{{Quote box|width=25em|align=left|bgcolor=#ACE1AF|quote=\"Space science, like nuclear science and all technology, has no conscience of its own.

The relationship between the Air Force space program and NASA continued to grow closer, with agreements being reached to share information and personnel. The Air Force also began development on the crewed [[Boeing X-20 Dyna-Soar]] spaceplane and [[Manned Orbiting Laboratory]], both of which were later canceled as their functions could be carried out by uncrewed systems. General Schriever's advocacy for military space led to the 1961 establishment of [[Air Force Systems Command]] (AFSC), which included a dedicated Space Systems Directorate to centralize all space development, separating it from the missile program. Prior to Air Force Systems Command's creation, spacecraft design, acquisitions, and launch was split between [[Air Material Command]] and Air Force Research and Development Command, however, the new command centralized all of these activities.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nThe Air Force provided space support to forces during the [[Vietnam War]], with a focus on providing space\u2013based weather and communications capabilities. In the 1970s development began on the [[Global Positioning System]], [[Defense Satellite Communications System]], and [[Defense Support Program]] missile warning satellites. The [[Space Shuttle]] also began development, with significant Air Force input. For much of the 1960s and 1970s, Air Force space operations were centralized in [[Aerospace Defense Command]], but it was disestablished in 1980, transferring its space surveillance and missile warning systems to Strategic Air Command. In 1979, Air Force doctrine recognized space as a mission area for the first time, and led to the creation of a space division on the [[Air Staff (United States)|Air Staff]]. Air Force Systems Command also established a deputy commander for space operations.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\n===Air Force Space Command (1982\u20132019)===\n[[File:Air Force Space Command.png|thumb|[[Air Force Space Command]] shield]]\n\nTowards the 1980s, the Air Force began to realize that it was insufficiently organized for military space operations, with assets and responsibilities split across Strategic Air Command, Air Force Systems Command, the [[Aerospace Defense Center]], and the Air Staff. In 1979, the [[United States Air Force Scientific Advisory Board|Air Force Scientific Advisory Board]] concluded that \"currently, the Air Force is inadequately organized for operational exploitation of space and has placed insufficient emphasis on inclusion of space systems in an integrated force study.\" In 1981, the Air Force took a measure to address this discontinuity, establishing the consolidated space operations center in Colorado Springs and began discussing the creation of a space command to centralize its space activities. On 1 September 1982, [[Air Force Space Command]] (AFSPC) was created as an Air Force [[List of major commands of the United States Air Force|major command]].<ref name=\"auto1\"/> Air Force Space Command centralized all space operations, including missile warning, launch operations, satellite control, space domain awareness, and satellite communications.<ref name=\"auto2\"/>\n\nAir Force Space Command was absolutely critical during the [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]], which would later be described as the first space war by Air Force Chief of Staff General [[Merrill McPeak]].

The 2001 Space Commission, chaired by former secretary of defense [[Donald Rumsfeld]] and composed of a number of military, space, and intelligence professionals, was set up to examine the national security space organization of the United States.

The Space Commission came to the conclusion that the Air Force treated space operations as a secondary mission in comparison to air operations, and recommended the creation of a space corps within the Department of the Air Force, and in the long term, creating a military department for space.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://aerospace.csis.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/RumsfeldCommission.pdf|title=Report to the Commission to Assess United States National Security Space Management and Organization|last=U.S. Government|date=10 January 2001|website=csis.org|access-date=11 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[File:President Trump Signs the 2020 NDAA (49259748917).jpg|thumb|right|President [[Donald Trump]] signs the 2020 National Defense Authorization Act, which established the Space Force, in Hangar 6 at [[Joint Base Andrews]], December 20, 2019.

In 1946 General Arnold directed Dr. [[Theodore von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n]] the [[RAND Corporation]] to determine the feasibility of a satellite for strategic reconnaissance. In 1946 this study identified nearly all current space mission areas, including intelligence, weather forecasting, communications, and navigation.<ref name=\"auto1\">{{cite web|url=https://media.defense.gov/2010/Oct/01/2001329745/-1/-1/0/AFD-101001-060.pdf|title=The U.S. Air Force in Space 1945 to the Twenty-first Century|publisher=USAF History and Museums Program, United States Air Force|place=Washington, D.C.|date=1998}}</ref>\n\n[[File:General Bernard A Schriever.jpg|thumb|General [[Bernard Schriever]] was the father of the military space program.]]\nAfter the [[United States Air Force]] gained its independence in 1947, General [[Bernard Schriever]] was appointed to head the [[Western Development Division]], made responsible for the Air Force's space and intercontinental ballistic missile programs. It was responsible for developing the Advanced Reconnaissance System, which would have been the Air Force's first satellite constellation. On 4 October 1957 the [[Soviet Union]] launched [[Sputnik 1]], which was the world's first satellite. This event transformed space development overnight, helping the national security establishment understand the importance of the space domain.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nEarly military space development was marked by strong interservice rivalry, with each developing their own proposals for satellites and launch vehicles. The first American satellite was the [[Army Ballistic Missile Agency]]'s [[Explorer 1]] which was launched on the [[Naval Research Laboratory]]'s [[Vanguard (rocket)|Vanguard]] rocket. The Air Force still continued military space development amidst this competition from the Army and Navy. In 1958 the newly formed [[DARPA|Advanced Research Projects Agency]] assumed control over all military space programs, but this centralization was short lived and in gave control back to the services in September 1959. The creation of [[NASA]] in 1958 significantly hampered the Army and Navy's space programs, absorbing the Army's [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] and [[Army Ballistic Missile Agency]] and Navy's [[Project Vanguard]] and [[Minitrack]] satellite tracking network, but only absorbed the Air Force's [[Man in Space Soonest]] program, merging it with [[Project Mercury]].<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nDevelopment of Air Force space systems continued with the [[Missile Defense Alarm System]] (MIDAS) and [[Strategic Air Command]]'s [[Samos (satellite)|SAMOS]] reconnaissance satellites, as well as the [[Thor (rocket family)|Thor]], [[Atlas (rocket family)|Atlas]], and [[Titan (rocket family)|Titan]] space launch vehicles. The Air Force and [[Central Intelligence Agency]] also jointly developed and operated the [[Corona (satellite)|Corona]] reconnaissance satellite. The development of reconnaissance satellites became a national priority after an American [[Lockheed U-2|U-2]] reconnaissance plane was [[1960 U-2 incident|shot down]] over the Soviet Union, making aerial reconnaissance impractical. In 1961 the [[National Reconnaissance Office]] was created as a joint Air Force\u2013CIA activity to manage all spy satellites.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n{{Quote box|width=25em|align=left|bgcolor=#ACE1AF|quote=\"Space science, like nuclear science and all technology, has no conscience of its own.

The relationship between the Air Force space program and NASA continued to grow closer, with agreements being reached to share information and personnel. The Air Force also began development on the crewed [[Boeing X-20 Dyna-Soar]] spaceplane and [[Manned Orbiting Laboratory]], both of which were later canceled as their functions could be carried out by uncrewed systems. General Schriever's advocacy for military space led to the 1961 establishment of [[Air Force Systems Command]] (AFSC), which included a dedicated Space Systems Directorate to centralize all space development, separating it from the missile program. Prior to Air Force Systems Command's creation, spacecraft design, acquisitions, and launch was split between [[Air Material Command]] and Air Force Research and Development Command, however, the new command centralized all of these activities.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nThe Air Force provided space support to forces during the [[Vietnam War]], with a focus on providing space\u2013based weather and communications capabilities. In the 1970s development began on the [[Global Positioning System]], [[Defense Satellite Communications System]], and [[Defense Support Program]] missile warning satellites. The [[Space Shuttle]] also began development, with significant Air Force input. For much of the 1960s and 1970s, Air Force space operations were centralized in [[Aerospace Defense Command]], but it was disestablished in 1980, transferring its space surveillance and missile warning systems to Strategic Air Command. In 1979, Air Force doctrine recognized space as a mission area for the first time, and led to the creation of a space division on the [[Air Staff (United States)|Air Staff]]. Air Force Systems Command also established a deputy commander for space operations.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\n===Air Force Space Command (1982\u20132019)===\n[[File:Air Force Space Command.png|thumb|[[Air Force Space Command]] shield]]\n\nTowards the 1980s, the Air Force began to realize that it was insufficiently organized for military space operations, with assets and responsibilities split across Strategic Air Command, Air Force Systems Command, the [[Aerospace Defense Center]], and the Air Staff. In 1979, the [[United States Air Force Scientific Advisory Board|Air Force Scientific Advisory Board]] concluded that \"currently, the Air Force is inadequately organized for operational exploitation of space and has placed insufficient emphasis on inclusion of space systems in an integrated force study.\" In 1981, the Air Force took a measure to address this discontinuity, establishing the consolidated space operations center in Colorado Springs and began discussing the creation of a space command to centralize its space activities. On 1 September 1982, [[Air Force Space Command]] (AFSPC) was created as an Air Force [[List of major commands of the United States Air Force|major command]].<ref name=\"auto1\"/> Air Force Space Command centralized all space operations, including missile warning, launch operations, satellite control, space domain awareness, and satellite communications.<ref name=\"auto2\"/>\n\nAir Force Space Command was absolutely critical during the [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]], which would later be described as the first space war by Air Force Chief of Staff General [[Merrill McPeak]]. Specifically, its GPS support enabled the left hook across the Iraq desert.<ref name=\"auto2\"/> Defense Meteorological Support Program satellites provided a significant amount of weather data and over 90% of communications were provided by satellite systems. The Defense Support Program early-warning satellites provided indications of SCUD launches to fielded forces.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nIn the 1990s, AFSPC led the development of the [[Milstar|MILSTAR]] communications satellite constellation and completed the GPS constellation.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> In accordance with the recommendations of the 2001 Space Commission, the [[Space and Missile Systems Center]] was transferred from [[Air Force Material Command]] to Air Force Space Command, becoming its integral research and acquisitions arm. In the aftermath of the [[September 11 attacks]], Air Force Space Command provided space support as part of the [[War on terror|global war on terrorism]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.afspc.af.mil/About-Us/Fact-Sheets/Display/Article/249014/air-force-space-command/|title=Air Force Space Command|website=Air Force Space Command}}</ref>\n\n===Independence (2019\u2013present)===\n[[File:Seal of the United States Space Force.jpg|thumb|U.S. Space Force logo used from 20 December 2019 on public social media accounts<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/USSpaceForceDoD/photos/a.446560887073/10158006856727074/?type=3|title=United States Space Force|website=www.facebook.com|language=en|access-date=2020-01-27}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/spaceforcedod?lang=en|title=United States Space Force (@SpaceForceDoD) {{!}} Twitter|website=twitter.com|language=en|access-date=2020-01-27}}</ref>]]\nThe idea of an independent service for U.S. military space operations had been under consideration by 2001. The 2001 Space Commission, chaired by former secretary of defense [[Donald Rumsfeld]] and composed of a number of military, space, and intelligence professionals, was set up to examine the national security space organization of the United States. The commission itself concluded that the military needed to develop space\u2013specific doctrine, operations concepts, and capabilities \u2013 including the development and deployment of space\u2013based weapons. The Space Commission came to the conclusion that the Air Force treated space operations as a secondary mission in comparison to air operations, and recommended the creation of a space corps within the Department of the Air Force, and in the long term, creating a military department for space.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://aerospace.csis.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/RumsfeldCommission.pdf|title=Report to the Commission to Assess United States National Security Space Management and Organization|last=U.S. Government|date=10 January 2001|website=csis.org|access-date=11 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[File:President Trump Signs the 2020 NDAA (49259748917).jpg|thumb|right|President [[Donald Trump]] signs the 2020 National Defense Authorization Act, which established the Space Force, in Hangar 6 at [[Joint Base Andrews]], December 20, 2019.

During the daytime, a rooster often sits on a high perch, usually {{convert|3|to|5|ft|m|1|abbr=in|order=flip}} off the ground, to serve as a lookout for his group (hence the term \"rooster\"). He sounds a distinctive alarm call if predators are nearby and will frequently crow to assert his territory.\n\n==Crowing==\n[[File:Hanenkraaiwedstrijd.jpg|thumb|A young [[Bergische Kr\u00e4her|Berg crower]] at a crowing contest]]\n[[File:Kr\u00e4hrufBergischerKr\u00e4her.ogg|thumb|The long crowing of a [[Bergische Kr\u00e4her|Berg crower]]]]\n[[File:Rooster crowing small.ogv|thumb|Normal length crowing (with audio)]]\n[[File:Cocks Fighting.jpg|thumb|Two cocks fighting]]\n[[File:Fighting cock Philippines.jpg|thumb|right|A rooster from the [[Philippines]] crowing. Note the characteristic neck bending that always takes place during crowing.]]\nRoosters almost always start crowing before four months of age. Although it is possible for a hen to crow as well, crowing (together with hackles development) is one of the clearest signs of being a rooster.<ref>{{cite web|last=Read|first=Gina|title=Sexing Chickens|url=http://successwithpoultry.blogspot.co.uk/2008/07/sexing-chickens.html|work=Keeping Chickens Newsletter|publisher=keepingchickensnewsletter.com|accessdate=5 July 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe rooster is often portrayed as crowing at the break of dawn (\"cock-a-doodle-doo\"). However, while many roosters crow shortly after waking up, this idea is not exactly true. A rooster can and will crow at any time of the day. Some roosters are especially vociferous, crowing almost constantly, while others only crow a few times a day. These differences are dependent both upon the rooster's breed and individual personality. A rooster can often be seen sitting on fence posts or other objects, where he crows to proclaim his territory.\n\nRoosters have several other calls as well, and can cluck, similar to the hen. Roosters occasionally make a patterned series of clucks to attract hens to a source of food, the same way a mother hen does for her chicks.\n\n===Rooster crowing contests===\nRooster crowing contests are a traditional sport in several countries, such as Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium,<ref>[http://www.nieuwsblad.be/cnt/blsde_20110627_002 Cock crowing contest recognised as National Heritage in Belgium] Stefaan De Groote, ''Het Nieuwsblad'', 27. June 2011 (in Dutch). Accessed October 2015</ref> the United States, [[Indonesia]] and Japan. The oldest contests are held with [[Long-crowing chicken|longcrowers]]. Depending on the breed, either the duration of the crowing or the times the rooster crows within a certain time is measured.\n\n==Capons==\n{{Main|Capon}}\nA capon is a castrated rooster. In the caponization procedure, the bird's [[testis|testes]] are completely removed; a surgical procedure is required for this as the rooster's sexual organs are internal. As a result of this procedure, certain male physical characteristics will experience stunted development:\n*The comb and wattles cease growing after castration, giving a capon's head a dwarfed appearance.\n*The hackle, tail and saddle [[feather]]s grow unusually long.\n\nCaponization also affects the disposition of the bird. Removal of the bird's testes eliminates the male sex [[hormone]]s, lessening the male sex instincts and changing their behaviour: the birds become more docile, less active, and tend not to fight.\n\nThis procedure produces a unique type of poultry meat which is favoured by a specialized market. The meat of normal uncastrated roosters has a tendency to become coarse, stringy and tough as the birds age. This process does not occur in the capon. As caponized roosters grow more slowly than intact males, they accumulate more body fat. The concentration of fat in both the light and dark areas of the capon meat is greater than in that of the uncastrated males. Overall, it is often thought that capon meat is more tender, juicy, and flavorful than regular chicken.\n\n==Cockfighting==\n{{Main|Cockfight}}\n[[File:Cockfighter.jpg|thumb|A fighting cock for sale]]\nA cockfight is a contest held in a ring called a cockpit between two [[gamecock]]s or cocks, with boxing gloves the first use of the word gamecock (denoting use of the cock in game, sport, pastime or entertainment) appearing in 1646.<ref>[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/gamecock gamecock - Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary] \u2013 first use of word \u2013 1646</ref> after the term \"cock of the game\" used by George Wilson, in the earliest known book on the secular sport of [[cockfight]]ing in ''The Commendation of Cocks and Cock Fighting'' in 1607. Gamecocks are not typical farm chickens. The cocks are specially [[bred]] and trained for increased stamina and strength. The comb and [[wattle (anatomy)|wattle]] are removed from a young gamecock because, if left intact, they would be a disadvantage during a match. This process is called [[Dubbing (poultry)|dubbing]]. Sometimes the cocks are given drugs to increase their stamina or thicken their blood, which increases their chances of winning. Cockfighting is considered a traditional sporting event by some, and an example of [[animal cruelty]] by others and is therefore outlawed in most countries.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2002/ALLPOLITICS/11/26/cf.opinion.cockfighting/index.html |title=Should cockfighting be outlawed in Oklahoma? |date=26 November 2002 |accessdate=17 August 2009 |work=CNN |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090619150618/http://archives.cnn.com/2002/ALLPOLITICS/11/26/cf.opinion.cockfighting/index.html |archivedate=19 June 2009}}</ref> Usually wagers are made on the outcome of the match, with the surviving or last-bird-standing being declared the winner.\n\nThere are religious significance and aspects of the rooster and the [[cockfight]] which are exampled by the religious belief of Tabuh Rah, a religious and spiritual cockfight where a rooster is used in religious custom by allowing him to fight against another rooster in the [[Balinese Hinduism]] spiritual appeasement exercise of Tabuh Rah, a form of [[animal sacrifice]], where [[ritual]] fights usually take place outside the [[temple]] and follow an ancient and complex ritual as set out in the sacred lontar manuscripts.<ref>[Indonesia Handbook, 3rd, Joshua Eliot, Liz Capaldi, & Jane Bickersteth], (Footprint \u2013 Travel Guides) 2001</ref> Similarly within the religious schema of Christianity and the cockfight within a religious, spiritual and sacred context, there are numerous representations of the rooster or the cock and the cockfight as a religious vessel found in the [[Catacombs]] from the earliest period<ref name=\"Rev.

On rare occasions, the hen will attempt to fight the cockerel for dominance. Once dominance is established, the cockerel will rarely waltz again. When other cockerels are in the hen yard, this waltz is used significantly more and most cockerels will waltz together if dominance has not been established; either one will back off, or the two cockerels will fight. The cockerel will waltz again if he is taken out of the pen for a period, usually 24 hours, and put back.\n\nSome more aggressive cockerels will drop and extend both wings and puff out all their body feathers to give the hens or other cocks the impression of a larger size, and charge through the hen yard.\n\n==Religion and spiritual belief systems==\n[[File:Rooster (walking).jpg|thumb|Rooster]]\nSince antiquity, the rooster has been, and still is, a sacred animal in some cultures<ref name=\"AdlerLawler\">{{cite magazine |author=Jerry Adler |author2=Andrew Lawler |date=June 2012 |title=How the Chicken Conquered the World |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/how-the-chicken-conquered-the-world-87583657/?no-ist= |magazine=Smithsonian}}</ref> and deeply embedded within various religious belief systems and [[religious worship]].

He sounds a distinctive alarm call if predators are nearby and will frequently crow to assert his territory.\n\n==Crowing==\n[[File:Hanenkraaiwedstrijd.jpg|thumb|A young [[Bergische Kr\u00e4her|Berg crower]] at a crowing contest]]\n[[File:Kr\u00e4hrufBergischerKr\u00e4her.ogg|thumb|The long crowing of a [[Bergische Kr\u00e4her|Berg crower]]]]\n[[File:Rooster crowing small.ogv|thumb|Normal length crowing (with audio)]]\n[[File:Cocks Fighting.jpg|thumb|Two cocks fighting]]\n[[File:Fighting cock Philippines.jpg|thumb|right|A rooster from the [[Philippines]] crowing. Note the characteristic neck bending that always takes place during crowing.]]\nRoosters almost always start crowing before four months of age. Although it is possible for a hen to crow as well, crowing (together with hackles development) is one of the clearest signs of being a rooster.<ref>{{cite web|last=Read|first=Gina|title=Sexing Chickens|url=http://successwithpoultry.blogspot.co.uk/2008/07/sexing-chickens.html|work=Keeping Chickens Newsletter|publisher=keepingchickensnewsletter.com|accessdate=5 July 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe rooster is often portrayed as crowing at the break of dawn (\"cock-a-doodle-doo\"). However, while many roosters crow shortly after waking up, this idea is not exactly true. A rooster can and will crow at any time of the day. Some roosters are especially vociferous, crowing almost constantly, while others only crow a few times a day. These differences are dependent both upon the rooster's breed and individual personality. A rooster can often be seen sitting on fence posts or other objects, where he crows to proclaim his territory.\n\nRoosters have several other calls as well, and can cluck, similar to the hen. Roosters occasionally make a patterned series of clucks to attract hens to a source of food, the same way a mother hen does for her chicks.\n\n===Rooster crowing contests===\nRooster crowing contests are a traditional sport in several countries, such as Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium,<ref>[http://www.nieuwsblad.be/cnt/blsde_20110627_002 Cock crowing contest recognised as National Heritage in Belgium] Stefaan De Groote, ''Het Nieuwsblad'', 27. June 2011 (in Dutch). Accessed October 2015</ref> the United States, [[Indonesia]] and Japan. The oldest contests are held with [[Long-crowing chicken|longcrowers]]. Depending on the breed, either the duration of the crowing or the times the rooster crows within a certain time is measured.\n\n==Capons==\n{{Main|Capon}}\nA capon is a castrated rooster. In the caponization procedure, the bird's [[testis|testes]] are completely removed; a surgical procedure is required for this as the rooster's sexual organs are internal. As a result of this procedure, certain male physical characteristics will experience stunted development:\n*The comb and wattles cease growing after castration, giving a capon's head a dwarfed appearance.\n*The hackle, tail and saddle [[feather]]s grow unusually long.\n\nCaponization also affects the disposition of the bird. Removal of the bird's testes eliminates the male sex [[hormone]]s, lessening the male sex instincts and changing their behaviour: the birds become more docile, less active, and tend not to fight.\n\nThis procedure produces a unique type of poultry meat which is favoured by a specialized market. The meat of normal uncastrated roosters has a tendency to become coarse, stringy and tough as the birds age. This process does not occur in the capon. As caponized roosters grow more slowly than intact males, they accumulate more body fat. The concentration of fat in both the light and dark areas of the capon meat is greater than in that of the uncastrated males. Overall, it is often thought that capon meat is more tender, juicy, and flavorful than regular chicken.\n\n==Cockfighting==\n{{Main|Cockfight}}\n[[File:Cockfighter.jpg|thumb|A fighting cock for sale]]\nA cockfight is a contest held in a ring called a cockpit between two [[gamecock]]s or cocks, with the first use of the word gamecock (denoting use of the cock in game, sport, pastime or entertainment) appearing in 1646.<ref>[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/gamecock gamecock - Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary] \u2013 first use of word \u2013 1646</ref> after the term \"cock of the game\" used by George Wilson, in the earliest known book on the secular sport of [[cockfight]]ing in ''The Commendation of Cocks and Cock Fighting'' in 1607. Gamecocks are not typical farm chickens. The cocks are specially [[bred]] and trained for increased stamina and strength. The comb and [[wattle (anatomy)|wattle]] are removed from a young gamecock because, if left intact, they would be a disadvantage during a match. This process is called [[Dubbing (poultry)|dubbing]]. Sometimes the cocks are given drugs to increase their stamina or thicken their blood, which increases their chances of winning. Cockfighting is considered a traditional sporting event by some, and an example of [[animal cruelty]] by others and is therefore outlawed in most countries.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2002/ALLPOLITICS/11/26/cf.opinion.cockfighting/index.html |title=Should cockfighting be outlawed in Oklahoma? |date=26 November 2002 |accessdate=17 August 2009 |work=CNN |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090619150618/http://archives.cnn.com/2002/ALLPOLITICS/11/26/cf.opinion.cockfighting/index.html |archivedate=19 June 2009}}</ref> Usually wagers are made on the outcome of the match, with the surviving or last-bird-standing being declared the winner.\n\nThere are religious significance and aspects of the rooster and the [[cockfight]] which are exampled by the religious belief of Tabuh Rah, a religious and spiritual cockfight where a rooster is used in religious custom by allowing him to fight against another rooster in the [[Balinese Hinduism]] spiritual appeasement exercise of Tabuh Rah, a form of [[animal sacrifice]], where [[ritual]] fights usually take place outside the [[temple]] and follow an ancient and complex ritual as set out in the sacred lontar manuscripts.<ref>[Indonesia Handbook, 3rd, Joshua Eliot, Liz Capaldi, & Jane Bickersteth], (Footprint \u2013 Travel Guides) 2001</ref> Similarly within the religious schema of Christianity and the cockfight within a religious, spiritual and sacred context, there are numerous representations of the rooster or the cock and the cockfight as a religious vessel found in the [[Catacombs]] from the earliest period<ref name=\"Rev.

On rare occasions, the hen will attempt to fight the cockerel for dominance. Once dominance is established, the cockerel will rarely waltz again. When other cockerels are in the hen yard, this waltz is used significantly more and most cockerels will waltz together if dominance has not been established; either one will back off, or the two cockerels will fight. The cockerel will waltz again if he is taken out of the pen for a period, usually 24 hours, and put back.\n\nSome more aggressive cockerels will drop and extend both wings and puff out all their body feathers to give the hens or other cocks the impression of a larger size, and charge through the hen yard.\n\n==Religion and spiritual belief systems==\n[[File:Rooster (walking).jpg|thumb|Rooster]]\nSince antiquity, the rooster has been, and still is, a sacred animal in some cultures<ref name=\"AdlerLawler\">{{cite magazine |author=Jerry Adler |author2=Andrew Lawler |date=June 2012 |title=How the Chicken Conquered the World |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/how-the-chicken-conquered-the-world-87583657/?no-ist= |magazine=Smithsonian}}</ref> and deeply embedded within various religious belief systems and [[religious worship]].

Old Crow Medicine Show's final version was certified Platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] in April 2013.<ref name=\"oldcrowcert\"/>\n\nThe song has been covered numerous times, notably by [[Nathan Carter]] in 2012 and [[Darius Rucker]] with [[Lady Antebellum]] in 2013. Rucker's version reached No. 1 on the [[Hot Country Songs]] chart and was certified triple Platinum by the RIAA in March 2014.<ref name=\"ruckercert\"/>\n\n==Content==\nThe song describes a [[hitchhiking]] journey south along the eastern coast of the United States from [[New England]] in the northeast through [[Roanoke, Virginia]], with the intended destination of [[Raleigh, North Carolina]], where the narrator hopes to see his lover. As the narrator is walking south of Roanoke, he meets (but does not likely travel far with) a trucker who is traveling from Philadelphia through Virginia westward toward the [[Cumberland Gap]] and [[Johnson City, Tennessee]].\n\nOld Crow Medicine Show's version of the song is in 2/4 [[time signature]], with an approximate tempo of 76 [[half note]]s per minute. It uses the [[I\u2013V\u2013vi\u2013IV]] pattern in the key of [[A major]], with the main chord pattern of A\u2013E\u2013F{{sharp}}m\u2013D.\n\n==Background and writing==\n{{Quote_box\n|width=20%\n|align=right\n|quote=I'd gotten a (Bob) Dylan bootleg in like ninth grade and I let (band co-founder) Ketch (Secor) listen to it, and he wrote the verses because Bob kind of mumbles them and that was it.

What's great about \"Wagon Wheel\" is that it has grown organically. The popularity of it was all based on word of mouth. There was no radio airplay for it. We made a music video for it, but it wasn't \"November Rain\" or anything. No one was like, 'Oh my God, what's this video about?'

He likely got it from a [[Big Bill Broonzy]] recording \"Rockin' Chair Blues\" from 1940 using the phrase \"rock me, baby\". The phrase \"like a wagon wheel\" is used in the 1939 Curtis Jones song \"Roll Me Mama\" that includes the lines \"Now roll me over, just like I'm a wagon wheel\" and \"just like I ain't got no bone\". He re-recorded it in 1963 as \"Roll Me Over\", with some of the lyrics.

He joined Old Crow Medicine Show at the [[Grand Ole Opry]] July 6, 2012, \"for a special rendition of 'Wagon Wheel'\" where the fans \"went crazy over Rucker's cover of the Old Crow Medicine Show hit.\" After this reception he [[Twitter|tweeted]] out: \"Secret out after @opry perf.

It's so different from a lot of his other stuff. It's such a cool record.\"<ref name=Greene /> Rucker also previously had had some experience with crediting Dylan on a song he'd performed. His group [[Hootie and the Blowfish]]'s 1995 hit single \"[[Only Wanna Be With You]]\" quotes an entire verse from Dylan's 1975 song \"[[Idiot Wind]]\". When the record began selling big, the \"Dylan camp\" took issue, and Dylan was ultimately credited as a co-writer. As Rucker remembers, \"They wanted some money, and they got it. We weren't trying to rip anybody off.\"<ref name=Greene />\n\n===Genre===\nFor Rucker it was largely an issue of musical genre and the high school group changing his thinking on it: \"I knew the song, and to me it was such a perfect bluegrass tune that I didn't think I could do it.

However, his position is jeopardized by the arrival of [[Buzz Lightyear]], an astronaut [[action figure]] that Andy gets as a birthday present, who the other toys quickly come to like more than Woody. Not only that, Buzz is convinced he is an actual Space Ranger. Annoyed and very jealous, Woody uses Buzz's belief that he is a Space Ranger against him to try to knock Buzz behind a desk, in hopes of retaining his status as Andy's favorite toy; Buzz instead falls out an open window and [[Mr. Potato Head (Toy Story)|Mr. Potato Head]] and the other toys accuse Woody of getting rid of Buzz on purpose, despite his attempt to convince them of the fact it was just an accident, and they became antagonistic towards him.\n\nWoody's plan initially proves effective, as Andy brings him along to the pizza establishment \"Pizza Planet\"; however, he encounters the antagonized Buzz, who had climbed onto the bumper while the van was pulling out of the driveway and entered through the open sunroof while it stopped at a gas station. Buzz then pushes Woody out of the van in order to get revenge for what Woody had done to him and then they fight. As a result, they both wind up getting left behind, but hitch a ride to Pizza Planet aboard a delivery truck. While Woody tries to reunite himself and Buzz with Andy, Buzz wanders off toward a rocket shaped [[claw machine]] much to Woody's dismay. They both wind up as prizes inside the machine and are snatched by Andy's malicious neighbor [[Sid Phillips (Toy Story)|Sid Phillips]], who likes abusing, destroying, and generally mistreating toys. With Andy's family about to move to a new house, Woody is frantic to plan an escape and encounters all of the toys monstrously reconstructed by Sid, where he discovers that they actually prove quite friendly and hospitable. As the movie carries on, Woody and Buzz race to escape Sid and Buzz discovers that he is an action figure. Woody even tries to get Andy's toys to help them but they refuse after seeing him holding Buzz's arm, believing that Woody murdered Buzz, and Sid makes plans to blow Buzz to bits using a firework rocket. When Sid goes to sleep, Woody sees to best possible opportunity to escape, but Buzz has become depressed over discovering he is just a toy, and so Woody explains to Buzz why it is not a bad thing. During this, Woody realizes he, himself now has nothing left, and tells Buzz to leave him, giving up on going back somewhere he now has no place in. The encouragement, however out of desperation, and most of all, their shared experience of both being at their lowest point, cause Buzz to regain hope, and his following actions to help Woody cause him to do the same. When Sid prepares to blow Buzz up, Woody devises a rescue mission enlisting assistance from Sid's toys, effectively petrifying Sid by coming to life in front of him. Later, when trying to get on board the moving truck containing Andy's other toys, Woody attempts to use [[RC (Toy Story)|RC]] to rescue Buzz from Sid's dog Scud but the other toys (now thinking that Woody had killed RC as well) antagonize him again and throw him off the truck. Buzz and RC pick up Woody and once the other toys realize that Buzz and RC are alive they try to help them get back on board but fail. Buzz and Woody manage to return to Andy and reconcile afterward, and Woody is re-accepted amongst the other toys, sharing the status as Andy's favorite toy with Buzz.\n\nA running gag is that throughout the movie Woody intentionally mispronounces Buzz's last name to mock him and Buzz fails to notice, such as \"Light-beer\" and \"Light-snack\". Woody's romantic interest in the film is [[Bo Peep (Toy Story)|Bo Peep]].\n\n===''Toy Story 2''===\nIn ''[[Toy Story 2]]'', Woody is preparing to go to Cowboy Camp with Andy, but his arm rips during Andy's playtime and Andy decides to leave Woody at home instead. After being placed on the shelf and fearing the worst for his fate, Woody meets a [[squeaky toy]] penguin named [[Wheezy (Toy Story)|Wheezy]], who has also been placed on the shelf after his squeaker broke. [[List of Toy Story characters#Mrs. Davis|Andy's mother]] holds a yard sale and marks Wheezy to be sold. After saving Wheezy with help from Andy's dog, Buster, Woody is stolen by a man named [[Al McWhiggin]], a greedy toy collector. At Al's apartment, Woody discovers his past and legacy as the star of a 1950s Western children's show titled ''Woody's Roundup'', which also starred prospector [[Stinky Pete]], cowgirl [[Jessie (Toy Story)|Jessie]], and Woody's horse [[Bullseye (Toy Story)|Bullseye]]. Woody learns that he and the other ''Roundup'' toys will be shipped to Japan to be displayed in a toy museum, which will only accept the collection if Woody is in it. Stinky Pete is intent to make sure that they get into the museum. It is revealed that Stinky Pete was never sold and had never experienced the love of a child for decades. Al calls a restoration expert to fix Woody's right arm. After that Stinky Pete convinces Woody to go along to Japan and forget Andy. Buzz and a few of the toys from the first film arrive to rescue Woody, who has a change of heart after watching an episode of ''Woody's Roundup'' in which he sings \"[[You've Got a Friend in Me]]\". Stinky Pete manages to prevent Woody from leaving the apartment.\n\nWoody and the other members of the ''Roundup'' gang are packed for shipping to Japan. However, the other toys catch up to Al at the airport and follow Al's luggage into the baggage handling area. Woody's arm tear reopens due to Stinky Pete cutting it with his pickaxe as he threatens Woody to stay in the luggage case. Eventually, Buzz stops Stinky Pete and manages to rescue Woody. Jessie and Bullseye are also rescued. In the ending, after returning home, Woody's arm is fixed by Andy.\n\n===''Toy Story 3''===\nIn ''[[Toy Story 3]]'', Andy is now 17 years old, and preparing to leave for [[college]]. Woody reassures the other toys that they will go into the attic, and tries convince them that they will enjoy their new life there, although Mr Potato Head disagrees. Andy chooses to take Woody with him, and puts the rest of the toys in a garbage bag to be stored in the attic, but Andy's mother mistakes them for garbage, and the toys just manage to escape a garbage truck. Woody tries to convince them that Andy did not intend to throw them away, but they refuse to believe him until much later, when Mrs Potato Head sees Andy searching for his toys through an eye she lost in his room. The toys go to Sunnyside daycare, with Woody being brought along after Mrs Davis closes the rear door of the car while he is trying to talk the others out of going. While the others choose to stay, Woody attempts to return to Andy, using a kite to glide over the heads of the children playing outside and pass over the wall, but is instead found and taken home by a little girl named Bonnie, who attends Sunnyside and is the daughter of the receptionist. At Bonnie's house, he becomes friends with her toys, who are horrified that he came from Sunnyside and tell him about the true nature of the daycare. Later, Woody returns to the daycare, where Andy's toys have been imprisoned by the daycare toys' bitter leader, [[Lotso]], whom Woody had learned about from Bonnie's toys. Woody learns from a Chatter Telephone that the only way to escape is through a garbage chute leading to an outside dumpster. He gathers Andy's other toys and helps them to escape, but in a confrontation with Lotso, is dragged into the dumpster just as the garbage truck arrives. Andy's other toys try to rescue him, but fall into the truck with him. They are brought to a landfill site, where despite their attempts to change his heart by helping him avoid a shredder, Lotso abandons them to their deaths on a conveyor belt headed into an incinerator. Resigned to their fate, they are rescued at the last minute by Andy's [[List of Toy Story characters#Aliens / Little Green Men|Alien toys]]. Woody then starts to think that maybe the attic isn't the best place for the other toys. Back at Andy's house, Woody contrives for all of them to be brought to Bonnie's house, where Andy passes them on to enjoy life with a new owner. Andy describes to Bonnie how he views his old toys and tells her that Woody has \"been my pal for as long as I can remember,\" then states that Woody is his favorite toy because he is loyal and would never give up on anyone which is what makes Woody so special. As Andy drives away to college, Woody says an emotional and final farewell to him, saying \"So long, partner\".\n\n===''Toy Story 4''===\nIn ''[[Toy Story 4]]'', Woody is not being played with as much as he used to, unlike all the other toys. Bonnie is upset about attending her kindergarten orientation and asks her parents if she can bring a toy, but is told that toys cannot go to school. Concerned, Woody decides to secretly go to kindergarten with Bonnie by sneaking into her backpack. In the school trash, Woody finds some leftover craft materials, which Bonnie uses to make [[List of Toy Story characters#Forky|Forky]], a toy spork. After the orientation, Bonnie and her family go on an RV road trip, but Woody has to prevent Forky from throwing himself away, as he believes he is trash.\n\nWhen Forky throws himself out of the window of the moving RV, Woody goes after him and teaches him the joys and responsibilities of being a toy. As they make their way to an RV park, Woody comes across Bo Peep's lamp at an antiques store and soon discovers Bo has now become a nomad adventurer helping lost toys find owners. At the antiques store, Woody meets a doll named Gabby. He escapes from Gabby after she plans to obtain his voice box, though Forky is held captive by Gabby's henchmen. After Woody reunites with Buzz, they and several other toys attempt to rescue Forky. Their plan fails, and Woody is abandoned by his fellow toys following an argument between him and Bo. Woody turns himself in by giving his voice box to Gabby in exchange for Forky, and also because of hearing Gabby's story about her having a defective voice box and never being loved by a child.\n\nAfter a change of heart, Bo and her gang return to retrieve Woody and Forky, and with their help, Gabby is adopted by a lonely girl at a carnival. With the assistance of Bonnie's toys, the RV makes it to the carnival and as Woody prepares to say goodbye to Bo, he becomes hesitant in doing so. At Buzz's and his friends' blessing, Woody decides to stay with Bo for good. He gives his sheriff badge to Jessie, and the rest of Bonnie's toys give him a final farewell hug, as he sets off to help Bo continue her mission of finding new owners for lost toys.\n\n===Other appearances===\nWoody made a cameo in the [[outtake]]s of Pixar's 1998 film ''[[A Bug's Life]]'' as a crew member, clapping the upside-down [[clapperboard]]. Then he appeared in the Andy's room sequence of ''[[Buzz Lightyear of Star Command: The Adventure Begins]]'' where he was voiced by [[Jim Hanks]] (Tom Hanks' brother), and the Andy's room intro of the ''[[Buzz Lightyear of Star Command]]'' television series as a cameo. Later, he appeared in the end credit epilogue of Pixar's 2006 movie ''[[Cars (film)|Cars]]'' as a toy [[station wagon]]. He also appeared in the theatrical shorts ''[[Hawaiian Vacation]]'', ''[[Small Fry (film)|Small Fry]]'', and ''[[Partysaurus Rex]]'', released from 2011 to 2012. He also appears in the television specials ''[[Toy Story of Terror!]]'' (2013) and ''[[Toy Story That Time Forgot]]'' (2014). Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks) has appeared and presented at the [[68th Academy Awards|68th]], the [[72nd Academy Awards|72nd]], and [[88th Academy Awards]]. Woody also appeared in the 2007 film ''[[Meet the Robinsons]]'' along with Jessie and Bullseye. Woody appeared in the 2017 ''[[Family Guy]]'' episode \"[[The Finer Strings]]\" in a cutaway gag set up by [[Stewie Griffin]]. The gag involves him walking in on Buzz and Bo Peep sleeping together. Woody and Buzz appear as pi\u00f1atas in Pixar's 2017 film ''[[Coco (2017 film)|Coco]]''. He also appears in various Disney crossover media, including the ''[[Disney Infinity]]'' series, ''[[Lego The Incredibles]]'' and ''[[Kingdom Hearts III]]''.\n\n==Characteristics==\n\n{{Quote|text=Woody is a passionate guy who throws himself into every action. As soon as he has an instinctive thought like \"I have to help them,\" or \"I have to run away,\" he does it with 100-percent commitment. You gotta love that about anybody. What's great is that I get credit for the way the character and the humor come off. I have kids that are now in college come up to me and say, \"when you told that neighbor kid to play nice, that really meant a lot to me\".|sign=[[Tom Hanks]]|source=<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.magicalmountain.net/disney-news/2346/interview-with-tom-hanks-disney-s-toy-3-woody.ashx |title=Interview With Tom Hanks, Disney's Toy 3 Woody |accessdate=August 15, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100601051203/http://www.magicalmountain.net/disney-news/2346/interview-with-tom-hanks-disney-s-toy-3-woody.ashx |archivedate=June 1, 2010 }}</ref> }}\n\nWoody is an old-fashioned floppy [[pullstring]] cowboy doll. The voice-box that is activated by the pullstring says many simple phrases such as \"Reach for the sky!\", \"You're my favorite deputy!\", \"There's a snake in my boot!\", and \"Somebody's poisoned the waterhole!\". As mentioned in ''Toy Story 2'', his construction includes an \"original hand-painted face, natural dyed-blanket stitched vest,\" and \"hand-stitched poly-vinyl hat.\" Woody wears an empty gun holster at his belt. He is Andy's favorite toy since kindergarten, with a special spot on the bed, and is the leader and the brains of the toys in Andy's room. In ''Toy Story 2'', it is revealed that he starred as the main character from a popular 1950s TV show, ''Woody's Roundup''. When Al is bargaining with Andy's mom in an attempt to take Woody, Andy's mom declines Al's bargain, stating that Woody is \"an old family toy.\" Stinky Pete also directly refers to him as a \"hand-me-down cowboy doll\" later in the movie. ''Toy Story'' director [[John Lasseter]] said \"we always thought\" that Woody was \"kind of a hand-me-down\" to Andy from his father.<ref>{{cite web |title=Woody |url=https://video.disney.com/watch/woody-4bb39ea6cd55da8833003b15 |website=Disney Video |accessdate=January 25, 2019}}</ref> Woody is voiced by [[Tom Hanks]] in the films and by his brother [[Jim Hanks]] on other occasions.\n\nIn the four films, Woody makes two strong friendships with Buzz and Jessie. At first, when Buzz temporarily becomes Andy's favorite toy, Woody tries to push him off the dresser but accidentally knocks him out the window. When found and taken by neighborhood bully Sid, however, Woody and Buzz work together to escape. From this point on, he and Buzz are very close. Although Woody and Jessie argue with each other sometimes, they are still close friends.\n\nIn the mock outtakes of ''Toy Story 2'', Woody is shown to have a more mischievous side towards Buzz, pulling pranks including hiding in a Buzz Lightyear cardboard box to make faces as Buzz walks past the hundreds of ''Buzz Lightyear'' toys on the shelves, drawing on Buzz's helmet, and using Buzz's wings as advertising space for rent when they suddenly pop open.\n\nWoody is named after [[Woody Strode]], a [[character actor]] known for many roles in [[Western (genre)|Western]] films.<ref name=\"Hischak2011\">{{cite book|last=Hischak|first=Thomas S.|title=Disney Voice Actors: A Biographical Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e1RTP8thtR0C&pg=PA94|accessdate=March 21, 2018|date=September 15, 2011|publisher=McFarland|isbn=9780786486946|page=94}}</ref> It was revealed in August 2009 by ''Toy Story 3'' director [[Lee Unkrich]] that Woody's official last name is \"Pride\".<ref name=Pride>{{cite web|url=http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Toy-Story-s-Lee-Unkrich-Reveals-Woody-s-Last-Name-14186.html|title=Toy Story's Lee Unkrich Reveals Woody's Last Name|publisher=Cinema Blend|last=Gomez|first=Tim|date=August 2, 2009|accessdate=January 25, 2019}}</ref> Unkrich stated in his [[Twitter]] feed that \"Woody's actual full name is 'Woody Pride', and has been since the earliest days of developing the original Toy Story.\"<ref>{{cite tweet|author=Lee Unkrich|user=leeunkrich|number=3091420661|date=August 2, 2009|title=Woody's actual full name is \"Woody Pride\", and has been since the earliest days of developing the original Toy Story.}}</ref>\n\n==Pullstring quotes==\nSome of Woody's known pullstring quotes include \"Reach for the sky!\", \"This town ain't big enough for the two of us!\", \"You're my favorite Deputy!\", \"Somebody's poisoned the waterhole!\", and \"There's a snake in my boot!\". This last phrase is an old reference to alcoholic hallucination that was commonly used during the Wild West era; the concept is akin to [[seeing pink elephants]], a later euphemism from the early 20th century.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Jensen Brown|first1=Peter|title=The Colorful History and Etymology of 'Pink Elephant'|url=http://esnpc.blogspot.com/2014/08/the-colorful-history-and-etymology-of.html|website=Early Sports 'n' Pop-Culture History|accessdate=April 12, 2016}}</ref> The euphemism, owing to the franchise's family-friendly approach, was left as an unexplained [[in-joke|inside joke]], and Woody is never seen drunk. In Toy Story 3, a quote that was not used from the first film which was, \"I'd like to join your posse boys, but first I'm gonna sing a little song\", is heard when Woody is in Bonnie's room for the first time. The saying is originally in a deleted scene in the first film set in Sid Philips' room.\n\n==Reception==\nTom Hanks's vocal performance as Sheriff Woody was received positively by film critics.

Woody even tries to get Andy's toys to help them but they refuse after seeing him holding Buzz's arm, believing that Woody murdered Buzz, and Sid makes plans to blow Buzz to bits using a firework rocket. When Sid goes to sleep, Woody sees to best possible opportunity to escape, but Buzz has become depressed over discovering he is just a toy, and so Woody explains to Buzz why it is not a bad thing. During this, Woody realizes he, himself now has nothing left, and tells Buzz to leave him, giving up on going back somewhere he now has no place in. The encouragement, however out of desperation, and most of all, their shared experience of both being at their lowest point, cause Buzz to regain hope, and his following actions to help Woody cause him to do the same. When Sid prepares to blow Buzz up, Woody devises a rescue mission enlisting assistance from Sid's toys, effectively petrifying Sid by coming to life in front of him. Later, when trying to get on board the moving truck containing Andy's other toys, Woody attempts to use [[RC (Toy Story)|RC]] to rescue Buzz from Sid's dog Scud but the other toys (now thinking that Woody had killed RC as well) antagonize him again and throw him off the truck. Buzz and RC pick up Woody and once the other toys realize that Buzz and RC are alive they try to help them get back on board but fail. Buzz and Woody manage to return to Andy and reconcile afterward, and Woody is re-accepted amongst the other toys, sharing the status as Andy's favorite toy with Buzz.\n\nA running gag is that throughout the movie Woody intentionally mispronounces Buzz's last name to mock him and Buzz fails to notice, such as \"Light-beer\" and \"Light-snack\". Woody's romantic interest in the film is [[Bo Peep (Toy Story)|Bo Peep]].\n\n===''Toy Story 2''===\nIn ''[[Toy Story 2]]'', Woody is preparing to go to Cowboy Camp with Andy, but his arm rips during Andy's playtime and Andy decides to leave Woody at home instead. After being placed on the shelf and fearing the worst for his fate, Woody meets a [[squeaky toy]] penguin named [[Wheezy (Toy Story)|Wheezy]], who has also been placed on the shelf after his squeaker broke. [[List of Toy Story characters#Mrs. Davis|Andy's mother]] holds a yard sale and marks Wheezy to be sold. After saving Wheezy with help from Andy's dog, Buster, Woody is stolen by a man named [[Al McWhiggin]], a greedy toy collector. At Al's apartment, Woody discovers his past and legacy as the star of a 1950s Western children's show titled ''Woody's Roundup'', which also starred prospector [[Stinky Pete]], cowgirl [[Jessie (Toy Story)|Jessie]], and Woody's horse [[Bullseye (Toy Story)|Bullseye]]. Woody learns that he and the other ''Roundup'' toys will be shipped to Japan to be displayed in a toy museum, which will only accept the collection if Woody is in it. Stinky Pete is intent to make sure that they get into the museum. It is revealed that Stinky Pete was never sold and had never experienced the love of a child for decades. Al calls a restoration expert to fix Woody's right arm. After that Stinky Pete convinces Woody to go along to Japan and forget Andy. Buzz and a few of the toys from the first film arrive to rescue Woody, who has a change of heart after watching an episode of ''Woody's Roundup'' in which he sings \"[[You've Got a Friend in Me]]\". Stinky Pete manages to prevent Woody from leaving the apartment.\n\nWoody and the other members of the ''Roundup'' gang are packed for shipping to Japan. However, the other toys catch up to Al at the airport and follow Al's luggage into the baggage handling area. Woody's arm tear reopens due to Stinky Pete cutting it with his pickaxe as he threatens Woody to stay in the luggage case. Eventually, Buzz stops Stinky Pete and manages to rescue Woody. Jessie and Bullseye are also rescued. In the ending, after returning home, Woody's arm is fixed by Andy.\n\n===''Toy Story 3''===\nIn ''[[Toy Story 3]]'', Andy is now 17 years old, and preparing to leave for [[college]]. Woody reassures the other toys that they will go into the attic, and tries convince them that they will enjoy their new life there, although Mr Potato Head disagrees. Andy chooses to take Woody with him, and puts the rest of the toys in a garbage bag to be stored in the attic, but Andy's mother mistakes them for garbage, and the toys just manage to escape a garbage truck. Woody tries to convince them that Andy did not intend to throw them away, but they refuse to believe him until much later, when Mrs Potato Head sees Andy searching for his toys through an eye she lost in his room. The toys go to Sunnyside daycare, with Woody being brought along after Mrs Davis closes the rear door of the car while he is trying to talk the others out of going. While the others choose to stay, Woody attempts to return to Andy, using a kite to glide over the heads of the children playing outside and pass over the wall, but is instead found and taken home by a little girl named Bonnie, who attends Sunnyside and is the daughter of the receptionist. At Bonnie's house, he becomes friends with her toys, who are horrified that he came from Sunnyside and tell him about the true nature of the daycare. Later, Woody returns to the daycare, where Andy's toys have been imprisoned by the daycare toys' bitter leader, [[Lotso]], whom Woody had learned about from Bonnie's toys. Woody learns from a Chatter Telephone that the only way to escape is through a garbage chute leading to an outside dumpster. He gathers Andy's other toys and helps them to escape, but in a confrontation with Lotso, is dragged into the dumpster just as the garbage truck arrives. Andy's other toys try to rescue him, but fall into the truck with him. They are brought to a landfill site, where despite their attempts to change his heart by helping him avoid a shredder, Lotso abandons them to their deaths on a conveyor belt headed into an incinerator. Resigned to their fate, they are rescued at the last minute by Andy's [[List of Toy Story characters#Aliens / Little Green Men|Alien toys]]. Woody then starts to think that maybe the attic isn't the best place for the other toys. Back at Andy's house, Woody contrives for all of them to be brought to Bonnie's house, where Andy passes them on to enjoy life with a new owner. Andy describes to Bonnie how he views his old toys and tells her that Woody has \"been my pal for as long as I can remember,\" then states that Woody is his favorite toy because he is loyal and would never give up on anyone which is what makes Woody so special. As Andy drives away to college, Woody says an emotional and final farewell to him, saying \"So long, partner\".\n\n===''Toy Story 4''===\nIn ''[[Toy Story 4]]'', Woody is not being played with as much as he used to, unlike all the other toys. Bonnie is upset about attending her kindergarten orientation and asks her parents if she can bring a toy, but is told that toys cannot go to school. Concerned, Woody decides to secretly go to kindergarten with Bonnie by sneaking into her backpack. In the school trash, Woody finds some leftover craft materials, which Bonnie uses to make [[List of Toy Story characters#Forky|Forky]], a toy spork. After the orientation, Bonnie and her family go on an RV road trip, but Woody has to prevent Forky from throwing himself away, as he believes he is trash.\n\nWhen Forky throws himself out of the window of the moving RV, Woody goes after him and teaches him the joys and responsibilities of being a toy. As they make their way to an RV park, Woody comes across Bo Peep's lamp at an antiques store and soon discovers Bo has now become a nomad adventurer helping lost toys find owners. At the antiques store, Woody meets a doll named Gabby. He escapes from Gabby after she plans to obtain his voice box, though Forky is held captive by Gabby's henchmen. After Woody reunites with Buzz, they and several other toys attempt to rescue Forky. Their plan fails, and Woody is abandoned by his fellow toys following an argument between him and Bo. Woody turns himself in by giving his voice box to Gabby in exchange for Forky, and also because of hearing Gabby's story about her having a defective voice box and never being loved by a child.\n\nAfter a change of heart, Bo and her gang return to retrieve Woody and Forky, and with their help, Gabby is adopted by a lonely girl at a carnival. With the assistance of Bonnie's toys, the RV makes it to the carnival and as Woody prepares to say goodbye to Bo, he becomes hesitant in doing so. At Buzz's and his friends' blessing, Woody decides to stay with Bo for good. He gives his sheriff badge to Jessie, and the rest of Bonnie's toys give him a final farewell hug, as he sets off to help Bo continue her mission of finding new owners for lost toys.\n\n===Other appearances===\nWoody made a cameo in the [[outtake]]s of Pixar's 1998 film ''[[A Bug's Life]]'' as a crew member, clapping the upside-down [[clapperboard]]. Then he appeared in the Andy's room sequence of ''[[Buzz Lightyear of Star Command: The Adventure Begins]]'' where he was voiced by [[Jim Hanks]] (Tom Hanks' brother), and the Andy's room intro of the ''[[Buzz Lightyear of Star Command]]'' television series as a cameo. Later, he appeared in the end credit epilogue of Pixar's 2006 movie ''[[Cars (film)|Cars]]'' as a toy [[station wagon]]. He also appeared in the theatrical shorts ''[[Hawaiian Vacation]]'', ''[[Small Fry (film)|Small Fry]]'', and ''[[Partysaurus Rex]]'', released from 2011 to 2012. He also appears in the television specials ''[[Toy Story of Terror!]]'' (2013) and ''[[Toy Story That Time Forgot]]'' (2014). Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks) has appeared and presented at the [[68th Academy Awards|68th]], the [[72nd Academy Awards|72nd]], and [[88th Academy Awards]]. Woody also appeared in the 2007 film ''[[Meet the Robinsons]]'' along with Jessie and Bullseye. Woody appeared in the 2017 ''[[Family Guy]]'' episode \"[[The Finer Strings]]\" in a cutaway gag set up by [[Stewie Griffin]]. The gag involves him walking in on Buzz and Bo Peep sleeping together. Woody and Buzz appear as pi\u00f1atas in Pixar's 2017 film ''[[Coco (2017 film)|Coco]]''. He also appears in various Disney crossover media, including the ''[[Disney Infinity]]'' series, ''[[Lego The Incredibles]]'' and ''[[Kingdom Hearts III]]''.\n\n==Characteristics==\n\n{{Quote|text=Woody is a passionate guy who throws himself into every action. As soon as he has an instinctive thought like \"I have to help them,\" or \"I have to run away,\" he does it with 100-percent commitment. You gotta love that about anybody. What's great is that I get credit for the way the character and the humor come off. I have kids that are now in college come up to me and say, \"when you told that neighbor kid to play nice, that really meant a lot to me\".|sign=[[Tom Hanks]]|source=<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.magicalmountain.net/disney-news/2346/interview-with-tom-hanks-disney-s-toy-3-woody.ashx |title=Interview With Tom Hanks, Disney's Toy 3 Woody |accessdate=August 15, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100601051203/http://www.magicalmountain.net/disney-news/2346/interview-with-tom-hanks-disney-s-toy-3-woody.ashx |archivedate=June 1, 2010 }}</ref> }}\n\nWoody is an old-fashioned floppy [[pullstring]] cowboy doll. The voice-box that is activated by the pullstring says many simple phrases such as \"Reach for the sky!\", \"You're my favorite deputy!\", \"There's a snake in my boot!\", and \"Somebody's poisoned the waterhole!\". As mentioned in ''Toy Story 2'', his construction includes an \"original hand-painted face, natural dyed-blanket stitched vest,\" and \"hand-stitched poly-vinyl hat.\" Woody wears an empty gun holster at his belt. He is Andy's favorite toy since kindergarten, with a special spot on the bed, and is the leader and the brains of the toys in Andy's room. In ''Toy Story 2'', it is revealed that he starred as the main character from a popular 1950s TV show, ''Woody's Roundup''. When Al is bargaining with Andy's mom in an attempt to take Woody, Andy's mom declines Al's bargain, stating that Woody is \"an old family toy.\" Stinky Pete also directly refers to him as a \"hand-me-down cowboy doll\" later in the movie. ''Toy Story'' director [[John Lasseter]] said \"we always thought\" that Woody was \"kind of a hand-me-down\" to Andy from his father.<ref>{{cite web |title=Woody |url=https://video.disney.com/watch/woody-4bb39ea6cd55da8833003b15 |website=Disney Video |accessdate=January 25, 2019}}</ref> Woody is voiced by [[Tom Hanks]] in the films and by his brother [[Jim Hanks]] on other occasions.\n\nIn the four films, Woody makes two strong friendships with Buzz and Jessie. At first, when Buzz temporarily becomes Andy's favorite toy, Woody tries to push him off the dresser but accidentally knocks him out the window. When found and taken by neighborhood bully Sid, however, Woody and Buzz work together to escape. From this point on, he and Buzz are very close. Although Woody and Jessie argue with each other sometimes, they are still close friends.\n\nIn the mock outtakes of ''Toy Story 2'', Woody is shown to have a more mischievous side towards Buzz, pulling pranks including hiding in a Buzz Lightyear cardboard box to make faces as Buzz walks past the hundreds of ''Buzz Lightyear'' toys on the shelves, drawing on Buzz's helmet, and using Buzz's wings as advertising space for rent when they suddenly pop open.\n\nWoody is named after [[Woody Strode]], a [[character actor]] known for many roles in [[Western (genre)|Western]] films.<ref name=\"Hischak2011\">{{cite book|last=Hischak|first=Thomas S.|title=Disney Voice Actors: A Biographical Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e1RTP8thtR0C&pg=PA94|accessdate=March 21, 2018|date=September 15, 2011|publisher=McFarland|isbn=9780786486946|page=94}}</ref> It was revealed in August 2009 by ''Toy Story 3'' director [[Lee Unkrich]] that Woody's official last name is \"Pride\".<ref name=Pride>{{cite web|url=http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Toy-Story-s-Lee-Unkrich-Reveals-Woody-s-Last-Name-14186.html|title=Toy Story's Lee Unkrich Reveals Woody's Last Name|publisher=Cinema Blend|last=Gomez|first=Tim|date=August 2, 2009|accessdate=January 25, 2019}}</ref> Unkrich stated in his [[Twitter]] feed that \"Woody's actual full name is 'Woody Pride', and has been since the earliest days of developing the original Toy Story.\"<ref>{{cite tweet|author=Lee Unkrich|user=leeunkrich|number=3091420661|date=August 2, 2009|title=Woody's actual full name is \"Woody Pride\", and has been since the earliest days of developing the original Toy Story.}}</ref>\n\n==Pullstring quotes==\nSome of Woody's known pullstring quotes include \"Reach for the sky!\", \"This town ain't big enough for the two of us!\", \"You're my favorite Deputy!\", \"Somebody's poisoned the waterhole!\", and \"There's a snake in my boot!\". This last phrase is an old reference to alcoholic hallucination that was commonly used during the Wild West era; the concept is akin to [[seeing pink elephants]], a later euphemism from the early 20th century.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Jensen Brown|first1=Peter|title=The Colorful History and Etymology of 'Pink Elephant'|url=http://esnpc.blogspot.com/2014/08/the-colorful-history-and-etymology-of.html|website=Early Sports 'n' Pop-Culture History|accessdate=April 12, 2016}}</ref> The euphemism, owing to the franchise's family-friendly approach, was left as an unexplained [[in-joke|inside joke]], and Woody is never seen drunk. In Toy Story 3, a quote that was not used from the first film which was, \"I'd like to join your posse boys, but first I'm gonna sing a little song\", is heard when Woody is in Bonnie's room for the first time. The saying is originally in a deleted scene in the first film set in Sid Philips' room.\n\n==Reception==\nTom Hanks's vocal performance as Sheriff Woody was received positively by film critics.

{"title_page": "Heritage turkey", "text_new": "{{About|a breed of fowl|the archaeology magazine|Heritage Turkey}}\n[[Image:Heritage Turkeys in MD.jpg|thumb|300px|Heritage turkeys of various breeds on a farm in [[Maryland]] ]]\n\nA '''heritage turkey''' is one of a variety of strains of [[domestic turkey]] which retains historic characteristics that are no longer present in the majority of turkeys raised for consumption since the mid-20th century. Heritage turkeys can be differentiated from other domestic turkeys in that they are biologically capable of being raised in a manner that more closely matches the natural behavior and life cycle of [[wild turkey]]s. Heritage turkeys have a relatively long lifespan and a much slower growth rate than turkeys bred for [[Industrial agriculture (animals)|industrial agriculture]], and unlike industrially bred turkeys, can [[reproduce]] without [[artificial insemination]].\n\nMore than ten different [[turkey breeds]] are classified as heritage turkeys, including the [[Auburn (turkey)|Auburn]], [[Buff (turkey)|Buff]], [[Black (turkey)|Black]], [[Bourbon Red]], [[Narragansett (turkey)|Narragansett]], [[Royal Palm (turkey)|Royal Palm]], [[Slate (turkey)|Slate]], [[Standard Bronze]], and [[Midget White]]. Some prominent chefs, farmers, and food critics have also contended that heritage turkey meat tastes better and is more healthful.\n\nDespite increasing interest in heritage turkeys, they are still a tiny minority, perhaps 25,000 raised annually compared to more than 200,000,000 industrial turkeys and 7,000,000 [[wild turkey|turkeys in the wild]], and most heritage breeds are endangered in some respect.\n\n==History==\nFor most of history, turkeys were primarily raised on small [[family farms]] for meat and as a form of [[pest control]] (turkeys are prodigious eaters of insects). But with the advent of [[factory farming]] of [[poultry]], turkeys began to be [[selective breeding|selectively bred]] for increasingly larger size, focusing especially on the production of [[Breast (disambiguation)|breast meat]]. Beginning in the 1920s and continuing in to the 1950s, broad-breasted fowl began to replace all other types of turkey in commercial production. The favorite breed at the time was the [[Broad Breasted Bronze]], which was developed from the [[Standard Bronze]]. In the 1960s producers began to heavily favor turkeys that did not show the dark [[pin feather]]s in their carcass, and thus the [[Broad Breasted White]] grew to dominate the industry, a trend which continues to this day.<ref name=\"Ekarius 2007 pp. 220-221\">Ekarius (2007) pp. 220-221</ref>\n\nTo meet perceived [[consumer demand]] and increase producers' profit margins, the goal in turkey farming became the production of the maximum amount of breast meat at the lowest possible cost. As a result of [[Selective breeding|selection]] for this single trait, 70% of the weight of mass market turkeys is in their breast.<ref name=\"Severson 2007\">Severson (2007)</ref> Consequently, the birds are so heavy that they are completely incapable of reproducing without [[artificial insemination]], and they reach such extreme weights so quickly their overall development fails to keep pace with their rapidly accruing muscle mass, resulting in severe [[immune system]], [[cardiac]], [[respiratory]] and leg problems.<ref name=\"Ekarius 2007 pp. 220-221\"/> \n[[File:Bourbon Red tom close-up.jpg|thumb|Heritage turkeys, like this [[Bourbon Red]] tom, can have a much more striking appearance than the Broad Breasted White.]]\nFor over 35 years, the overwhelming majority of the 280 million turkeys produced in North America each year have been the product of a few genetic strains of Broad Breasted White. The breeding stock for these birds are owned largely by three [[multinational corporation]]s: Hybrid Turkeys of [[Ontario, Canada]], British United Turkeys of America in [[Lewisburg, West Virginia]], and Nicholas Turkey Breeding Farms in [[Sonoma, California]].<ref name=\"Burros 2001\">Burros (2001)</ref>\n\nAlong with the adoption of the Broad Breasted White by industrial producers, other turkey varieties faded in numbers. Other than [[Livestock show|exhibition]] birds and those on a scant few small farms, other turkeys virtually disappeared. By the end of the 20th century, all but the Broad Breasted White were in danger of extinction. Around this time, conservation organizations began to recognize the plight of heritage turkeys; [[The Livestock Conservancy]] considered heritage turkeys to be the most critically endangered of all domestic animals circa 1997. A census conducted by the Conservancy found less than 1,500 total breeding birds (out of all heritage varieties) were left in the country. Some breeds, such as the Narragansett, had less than a dozen individuals left, and many considered most heritage turkeys to be beyond hope.<ref name=\"Ekarius 2007 p. 220\">Ekarius (2007) p. 220</ref>\n\nThe Livestock Conservancy, [[Slow Food USA]], the Society for the Preservation of Poultry Antiquities (SPAA), the Heritage Turkey Foundation, and a few hundred key poultry enthusiasts launched a major effort to restore breeding populations of heritage turkeys in the late 20th century. One man in particular, Frank Reese Jr., has been credited by sources such as [[ABC News]] and ''[[The New York Times]]'' as being instrumental in preserving heritage breeds,<ref name=\"Severson 2007\"/><ref>Gibson (2007)</ref> but small farmers all across the country were also important; strains of heritage turkey kept in genetic isolation for years by family farms preserved heritage breeds for the future.<ref name=\"Mapes 2007\">Mapes (2007)</ref> Primary motivations for the endeavor included a passion for historic breeds and maintaining [[genetic diversity]] among domestic animals which humans depend upon.<ref name=\"Severson 2007\"/> Consumer and restaurant interest was also motivated by a support of [[local food|local]] and [[sustainable]] foods.<ref name=\"Mapes 2007\"/>\n\nIn a 2003 census by the Livestock Conservancy, heritage turkey populations had increased by more than 200 percent. By 2006, the count of heritage turkeys in the U.S. was up to 8,800 breeding birds.<ref name=\"Mapes 2007\"/> Though all but the [[Bourbon Red]] and [[Royal Palm (turkey)|Royal Palm]] are still considered critically endangered, the birds have rebounded significantly.<ref name=\"Ekarius 2007 p. 220\"/>\n\n==Definition==\n[[File:Heritage turkey, thanksgiving.jpg|thumb|right|A heritage turkey prepared for roasting. Note the ratio of breast meat to dark meat is closer to 50/50.]]\nWhile the moniker of heritage turkey is not a government-regulated label like [[organic food]]s, it does have a precise definition. The most notable heritage turkeys today come from specific breeds, such as the Bourbon Red, but any fowl regardless of breed can be defined as a heritage turkey if it meets the criteria mentioned below. Only a few of these are recognized by the [[American Poultry Association]] through inclusion in the ''[[Standard of Perfection]]''.\n\nAlong with the surge in popularity of heritage turkeys, some farmers have (perhaps unknowingly) passed off birds which do not meet the basic definition of true heritage birds in an effort to cash in on the phenomenon. To be a true heritage turkey, birds must meet three specific criteria.\n\n===Naturally mating===\nThe first criterion is that heritage turkeys are able to mate naturally with no intervention from humans, and with expected fertility rates of 70-80%. Hens can lay fertile eggs, and [[brooding|brood]] their clutches to hatching. According to The Livestock Conservancy, birds must be the result of natural reproduction in order to truly be called heritage turkeys.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Definition of a Heritage Turkey, albc-usa.org</ref>\n\n===Long productive lifespan===\nExcept for a few flocks of toms kept for semen production, commercial turkeys generally never live past the point at which they reach market weight. Heritage turkeys are capable of the full normal lifespan of wild turkeys. Breeding hens are commonly productive for 5\u20137 years and breeding toms for 3\u20135 years. They are also more well-suited for outdoor and/or [[free range]] conditions in [[pastured poultry]] operations.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===Slow growth rate===\nAll heritage turkeys have a relatively slow to moderate rate of growth. Turkeys raised in industrial agriculture are slaughtered at 14 to 18 weeks of age, while heritage turkeys reach a marketable weight in about 28 weeks, giving the birds time to develop a strong skeletal structure and healthy organs prior to building muscle mass. This growth rate is identical to that of the commercial varieties of the first half of the 20th century.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n==As food==\n{{Rquote|right|...this represented a completely different order of turkey. Now I understood what turkey was like before the triumph of the Broad Breasted White, and why eating turkey had once been considered a great treat...|[[Michael Pollan]]<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.motherjones.com/news/feature/2003/05/ma_372_01.html |title=Cruising on the Ark of taste |last=Pollan |first=Michael |date=May\u2013June 2003 |work=Mother Jones}}</ref>}}\n\nHeritage means a bird is more than a descendant of earlier breeds with names like Red Bourbon, Narragansett, and Standard Bronze: The American Livestock Breed Conservancy outlines that heritage turkeys must mate naturally, have a slow growth rate that results from a longer lifespan and spend their life outdoors. Heritage turkeys are smaller than their commercially bred counterparts (which are all Broad Breasted Whites) and have a stronger\u2014some say gamy\u2014flavor. Less breast meat and more highly exercised thighs and wings mean heritage turkeys benefit from longer, slower cooking times.\n\nHeritage turkeys have been praised by chefs and food critics alike as being richer in flavor than industrial birds,<ref name=\"Mapes 2007\"/> though the lack of a large amount of breast meat means cooking times and methods may differ substantially from non-heritage birds.<ref>Ness (2005)</ref> Heritage turkeys are closer in taste to wild turkeys, but are several pounds larger. Part of this stated increase in flavor is due to a difference in the maturity between industrial turkeys and heritage ones - if birds are slaughtered at less than four months old, they fail to ever accrue fat layers.<ref name=\"Burros 2001\"/>\n\nDue to their rarity and the length of time involved in their growth, heritage turkeys are also far more expensive than their more common brethren. While turkeys from [[intensive animal farming|factory farms]] may be given away along with other purchases, heritage turkeys can cost upwards of $200 ([[USD]]),<ref name=\"Burros 2001\"/> though prices have fallen in some areas as they become more common.<ref name=\"Mapes 2007\"/>\n\nIn addition to a difference in culinary characteristics, heritage turkeys are often considered to be a more healthful food; as a result of the diet of [[Pastured poultry|pasture-raised turkeys]], heritage meat contains far higher levels of [[omega-3 fatty acids]], which help prevent [[heart disease]].<ref name=\"Burros 2001\"/>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Heirloom plant]]\n* [[Rare breed (agriculture)]]\n*[[ Turkey's drive go carts]]\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book |title=Storey's Illustrated Guide to Poultry Breeds |last=Ekarius |first=Carol |year=2007 |publisher=Storey Publishing |location=210 MAS MoCA Way, North Adams MA 01247  |isbn=978-1-58017-667-5 }}\n* {{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9906E3DD1F3BF932A15752C1A9679C8B63&sec=&spon=&&scp=6&sq=%22heritage%20turkey%22&st=cse|title=The Hunt for a Truly Grand Turkey, One That Nature Built |last=Burros|first=Marian|date=November 21, 2001|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2008-07-20 }}\n* {{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D03E3DD143BF934A35752C1A9619C8B63&sec=&spon=&&scp=4&sq=%22heritage%20turkey%22&st=cse|title=Preservation's Progress |last=Severson|first=Kim|date=November 7, 2007|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2008-07-20 }}\n* {{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/WN/Story?id=3877543&page=1|title=The Man Who Saved Turkeys From Extinction|last=Gibson|first=Charles|author2=Blair Soden|date=November 15, 2007|work=[[ABC News]]|accessdate=2008-07-20 }}\n* {{cite news |url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2005-11-02/food/17398183_1_heritage-turkeys-heritage-foods-usa-poults |title=Consumers gobble up Heritage American turkeys |last=Ness |first=Carol |work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |date=November 2, 2005 }}\n* {{cite news |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/pacificnw10212007/2003957455_pacificpturkeys21.html |title=Pilgrim's Progress |last=Mapes |first=Lynda V. |work=[[Seattle Times]] |date=October 21, 2007 }}\n* {{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=16492683|title=Heritage Turkeys, the Better Holiday Bird |date=November 21, 2007|work=[[National Public Radio]]|accessdate=2008-07-20 }}\n* {{cite web |url=http://www.albc-usa.org/cpl/turkdefinition.html |title=Definition of a Heritage Turkey |work=albc-usa.org |publisher=[[American Livestock Breeds Conservancy]] |accessdate=2008-07-20 }}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite web |url=http://www.albc-usa.org/downloads.html#turkey |title=How to Raise Heritage Turkeys on Pasture |publisher=American Livestock Breeds Conservancy }}\n* {{cite web |url=http://www.amerpoultryassn.com |title=American Standard of Perfection, 1998, A Complete Description of All Recognized Breeds and Varieties of Domestic Poultry |publisher=[[American Poultry Association]] }}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://heritageturkeyfoundation.org/ Heritage Turkey Foundation]\n\n[[Category:Conservation Priority Breeds of the Livestock Conservancy]]\n[[Category:Sustainable agriculture]]\n[[Category:Slow Food]]\n[[Category:Turkey breeds]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|a breed of fowl|the archaeology magazine|Heritage Turkey}}\n[[Image:Heritage Turkeys in MD.jpg|thumb|300px|Heritage turkeys of various breeds on a farm in [[Maryland]] ]]\n\nA '''heritage turkey''' is one of a variety of strains of [[domestic turkey]] which retains historic characteristics that are no longer present in the majority of turkeys raised for consumption since the mid-20th century.

They are also more well-suited for outdoor and/or [[free range]] conditions in [[pastured poultry]] operations.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===Slow growth rate===\nAll heritage turkeys have a relatively slow to moderate rate of growth. Turkeys raised in industrial agriculture are slaughtered at 14 to 18 weeks of age, while heritage turkeys reach a marketable weight in about 28 weeks, giving the birds time to develop a strong skeletal structure and healthy organs prior to building muscle mass. This growth rate is identical to that of the commercial varieties of the first half of the 20th century.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n==As food==\n{{Rquote|right|...this represented a completely different order of turkey. Now I understood what turkey was like before the triumph of the Broad Breasted White, and why eating turkey had once been considered a great treat...|[[Michael Pollan]]<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.motherjones.com/news/feature/2003/05/ma_372_01.html |title=Cruising on the Ark of taste |last=Pollan |first=Michael |date=May\u2013June 2003 |work=Mother Jones}}</ref>}}\n\nHeritage means a bird is more than a descendant of earlier breeds with names like Red Bourbon, Narragansett, and Standard Bronze: The American Livestock Breed Conservancy outlines that heritage turkeys must mate naturally, have a slow growth rate that results from a longer lifespan and spend their life outdoors. Heritage turkeys are smaller than their commercially bred counterparts (which are all Broad Breasted Whites) and have a stronger\u2014some say gamy\u2014flavor. Less breast meat and more highly exercised thighs and wings mean heritage turkeys benefit from longer, slower cooking times.\n\nHeritage turkeys have been praised by chefs and food critics alike as being richer in flavor than industrial birds,<ref name=\"Mapes 2007\"/> though the lack of a large amount of breast meat means cooking times and methods may differ substantially from non-heritage birds.<ref>Ness (2005)</ref> Heritage turkeys are closer in taste to wild turkeys, but are several pounds larger. Part of this stated increase in flavor is due to a difference in the maturity between industrial turkeys and heritage ones - if birds are slaughtered at less than four months old, they fail to ever accrue fat layers.<ref name=\"Burros 2001\"/>\n\nDue to their rarity and the length of time involved in their growth, heritage turkeys are also far more expensive than their more common brethren. While turkeys from [[intensive animal farming|factory farms]] may be given away along with other purchases, heritage turkeys can cost upwards of $200 ([[USD]]),<ref name=\"Burros 2001\"/> though prices have fallen in some areas as they become more common.<ref name=\"Mapes 2007\"/>\n\nIn addition to a difference in culinary characteristics, heritage turkeys are often considered to be a more healthful food; as a result of the diet of [[Pastured poultry|pasture-raised turkeys]], heritage meat contains far higher levels of [[omega-3 fatty acids]], which help prevent [[heart disease]].<ref name=\"Burros 2001\"/>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Heirloom plant]]\n* [[Rare breed (agriculture)]]\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book |title=Storey's Illustrated Guide to Poultry Breeds |last=Ekarius |first=Carol |year=2007 |publisher=Storey Publishing |location=210 MAS MoCA Way, North Adams MA 01247  |isbn=978-1-58017-667-5 }}\n* {{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9906E3DD1F3BF932A15752C1A9679C8B63&sec=&spon=&&scp=6&sq=%22heritage%20turkey%22&st=cse|title=The Hunt for a Truly Grand Turkey, One That Nature Built |last=Burros|first=Marian|date=November 21, 2001|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2008-07-20 }}\n* {{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D03E3DD143BF934A35752C1A9619C8B63&sec=&spon=&&scp=4&sq=%22heritage%20turkey%22&st=cse|title=Preservation's Progress |last=Severson|first=Kim|date=November 7, 2007|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2008-07-20 }}\n* {{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/WN/Story?id=3877543&page=1|title=The Man Who Saved Turkeys From Extinction|last=Gibson|first=Charles|author2=Blair Soden|date=November 15, 2007|work=[[ABC News]]|accessdate=2008-07-20 }}\n* {{cite news |url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2005-11-02/food/17398183_1_heritage-turkeys-heritage-foods-usa-poults |title=Consumers gobble up Heritage American turkeys |last=Ness |first=Carol |work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |date=November 2, 2005 }}\n* {{cite news |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/pacificnw10212007/2003957455_pacificpturkeys21.html |title=Pilgrim's Progress |last=Mapes |first=Lynda V. |work=[[Seattle Times]] |date=October 21, 2007 }}\n* {{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=16492683|title=Heritage Turkeys, the Better Holiday Bird |date=November 21, 2007|work=[[National Public Radio]]|accessdate=2008-07-20 }}\n* {{cite web |url=http://www.albc-usa.org/cpl/turkdefinition.html |title=Definition of a Heritage Turkey |work=albc-usa.org |publisher=[[American Livestock Breeds Conservancy]] |accessdate=2008-07-20 }}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite web |url=http://www.albc-usa.org/downloads.html#turkey |title=How to Raise Heritage Turkeys on Pasture |publisher=American Livestock Breeds Conservancy }}\n* {{cite web |url=http://www.amerpoultryassn.com |title=American Standard of Perfection, 1998, A Complete Description of All Recognized Breeds and Varieties of Domestic Poultry |publisher=[[American Poultry Association]] }}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://heritageturkeyfoundation.org/ Heritage Turkey Foundation]\n\n[[Category:Conservation Priority Breeds of the Livestock Conservancy]]\n[[Category:Sustainable agriculture]]\n[[Category:Slow Food]]\n[[Category:Turkey breeds]]\n", "name_user": "142.165.171.190", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eSee also)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heritage_turkey"}

Amino acids at the surface of the proteins begin losing charge and become neutral, turning the fat micelles from [[hydrophilic]] to [[hydrophobic]] state and causing the liquid to [[Curd|coagulate]]. If the bacteria are left in the milk too long, the pH lowers further, the micelles attain a positive charge, and the mixture returns to liquid form.

It can be used in cooking to make [[cheesecake]] and to thicken sauces and make them creamy. Cream cheese is sometimes used in place of or with [[butter]] (typically two parts cream cheese to one part butter) when making [[cake]]s or [[cookie]]s, and cream cheese frosting.

He served as [[Minister for Foreign Affairs (Germany)|Foreign Minister]] and as [[Vice-Chancellor of Germany|Vice Chancellor]] in [[Kurt Georg Kiesinger]]'s cabinet, and became chancellor in 1969. As chancellor, he maintained West Germany's close alignment with the [[United States]] and focused on strengthening [[European integration]] in western Europe, while launching the new policy of ''[[Ostpolitik]]'' aimed at improving relations with Eastern Europe. Brandt was controversial on both the right wing, for his ''Ostpolitik'', and on the left wing, for his support of American policies, including the [[Vietnam War]], and [[right-wing authoritarian]] regimes. The [[Brandt Report]] became a recognised measure for describing the general [[North-South divide]] in world economics and politics between an affluent North and a poor South. Brandt was also known for his fierce [[anti-communist]] policies at the domestic level, culminating in the ''[[Radikalenerlass]]'' (Anti-Radical Decree) in 1972.\n\nBrandt resigned as chancellor in 1974, after [[G\u00fcnter Guillaume]], one of his closest aides, [[Guillaume Affair|was exposed]] as an agent of the [[Stasi]], the [[GDR|East German]] [[secret service]].\n\n== Early life and the Second World War ==\nWilly Brandt was born Herbert Ernst Carl Frahm in the [[Free City of L\u00fcbeck]] ([[German Empire]]) on 18 December 1913.<ref>{{cite book|last=Jessup|first=John E.|title=An Encyclopedic Dictionary of Conflict and Conflict Resolution, 1945\u20131996|year=1998|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=Westport, CT|page=89|url=https://www.questia.com/read/106899354/an-encyclopedic-dictionary-of-conflict-and-conflict}} {{Subscription required|via=Questia}}</ref> His mother was Martha Frahm (16 March 1894 \u2013 3 August 1969){{citation needed|date=January 2018}} a [[single parent]], who worked as a cashier for a department store.

He left the SPD to join the more left wing [[SAPD|Socialist Workers Party]] (SAP), which was allied to the [[Workers' Party of Marxist Unification|POUM]] in [[Spain]] and the [[Independent Labour Party]] in [[UK|Britain]]. After passing his [[Abitur]] in 1932 at ''Johanneum zu L\u00fcbeck'', he became an apprentice at the shipbroker and ship's agent F.&nbsp;H. Bertling. In 1933, using his connections with the port and its ships, he left Germany for [[Norway]] to escape [[Nazism|Nazi]] persecution. It was at this time that he adopted the [[pseudonym]] '''Willy Brandt''' to avoid detection by Nazi agents. In 1934, he took part in the founding of the [[International Bureau of Revolutionary Youth Organizations]], and was elected to its secretariat.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nBrandt was in Germany from September to December 1936, disguised as a Norwegian student named Gunnar Gaasland. The real Gunnar Gaasland was married to Gertrud Meyer from L\u00fcbeck in a [[marriage of convenience]] to protect her from deportation. Meyer had joined Brandt in Norway in July 1933. In 1937, during the [[Spanish Civil War|Civil War]], Brandt worked in [[Spain]] as a journalist. In 1938, the German government revoked his citizenship, so he applied for [[Norwegian nationality law|Norwegian citizenship]]. In 1940, he was arrested in Norway by occupying German forces, but was not identified as he wore a Norwegian uniform. On his release, he escaped to [[Sweden during World War II|neutral Sweden]]. In August 1940, he became a Norwegian citizen, receiving his passport from the [[Norwegian legation in Stockholm|Norwegian legation]] in [[Stockholm]], where he lived until the end of the war. Willy Brandt lectured in Sweden on 1 December 1940 at [[Bommersvik]] College about problems experienced by the [[social democrats]] in [[Nazi Germany]] and the occupied countries at the start of the [[Second World War]]. In exile in Norway and Sweden, Brandt learned [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] and [[Swedish language|Swedish]]. Brandt spoke Norwegian fluently, and retained a close relationship with Norway.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nIn late 1946, Brandt returned to [[Berlin]], working for the Norwegian government. In 1948, he joined the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD) and became a German citizen again, formally adopting the pseudonym Willy Brandt as his legal name.\n\n== Politician ==\nBrandt was elected to the West German [[Bundestag]] (the federal parliament) in the [[1949 West German federal election]] as a [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] delegate from West Berlin, serving there until 1957. Concurrently, he was elected as an SPD representative to the [[Abgeordnetenhaus of Berlin|Abgeordnetenhaus]] (the state-level parliament) of West Berlin in the [[1950 West Berlin state election]], and served there through 1971.

In Brandt's first year as mayor of Berlin, he also served as the president of the [[Bundesrat of Germany|Bundesrat]] in Bonn. Brandt was an outspoken critic of Soviet repression of the 1956 [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungarian Uprising]] and of [[Nikita Khrushchev]]'s 1958 proposal that Berlin receive the status of a \"[[City-state|free city]]\". He was supported by the influential publisher [[Axel Springer]]. As mayor of West Berlin, Brandt accomplished much in the way of urban development. New hotels, office-blocks and flats were constructed, while both [[Schloss Charlottenburg]] and the [[Reichstag building]] were restored. Sections of the \"Stadtring\" [[Bundesautobahn 100]] [[inner city]] motorway were opened, while a major housing programme was carried out, with roughly 20,000 new dwellings built each year during his time in office.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://spartacus-educational.com/GERbrandtW.htm |title=Willy Brandt : Biography |publisher=Spartacus-Educational.com |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111009112249/http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/GERbrandtW.htm |archivedate=9 October 2011  }}</ref>\n\n[[File:John F.

Kennedy]] saw Brandt as the wave of the future in West Germany and was hoping he would replace [[Konrad Adenauer]] as chancellor following elections later that year.<ref>{{harvp|Kempe|2011|p=98}}</ref> Kennedy made this preference clear by inviting Brandt, the West German opposition leader, to an official meeting at the [[White House]] a month before meeting with Adenauer, the country's leader. The diplomatic snub strained relations between Kennedy and Adenauer further during an especially tense time for Berlin.<ref>{{harvp|Kempe|2011|p=166}}</ref> However, following the building of the Berlin Wall in August 1961, Brandt was disappointed and angry with Kennedy. Speaking in Berlin three days later, Brandt criticized Kennedy, asserting \"Berlin expects more than words. It expects political action.\" He also wrote Kennedy a highly critical public letter in which he warned that the development was liable \"to arouse doubts about the ability of the three [Allied] Powers to react and their determination\" and he called the situation \"a state of accomplished extortion\".<ref>{{harvp|Kempe|2011|pp=375\u2013376}}</ref>\n\nBrandt became the chairman of the SPD in 1964, a post that he retained until 1987, longer than any other party chairman since the founding of the SPD by [[August Bebel]]. Brandt was the SPD candidate for the chancellorship in 1961, but he lost to [[Konrad Adenauer]]'s conservative [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany]] (CDU). In 1965, Brandt ran again, but lost to the popular [[Ludwig Erhard]]. Erhard's government was short-lived, however, and in 1966 a [[grand coalition]] between the SPD and CDU was formed, with Brandt serving as [[foreign minister]] and as the 5th [[Vice-Chancellor of Germany]].\n\n== Chancellor ==\nAt the 1969 elections, again with Brandt as the leading candidate, the SPD became stronger, and after three weeks of negotiations, the SPD [[Social-liberal coalition|formed a coalition]] government with the smaller [[Free Democratic Party of Germany]] (FDP). Brandt was elected [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany]].\n\n=== Foreign policy ===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F037099-0021, K\u00f6ln, Staatsempfang f\u00fcr Pr\u00e4sident Pompidou.jpg|thumb|Willy Brandt with [[France|French]] president [[Georges Pompidou]] in [[Cologne]], 3 July 1972.]]\n\nAs chancellor, Brandt developed his ''[[Neue Ostpolitik]]'' (''New Eastern Policy'') by stages. Brandt was active in creating a degree of rapprochement with [[East Germany]], and also in improving relations with the Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and other [[Eastern Bloc]] (communist) countries.\n\nBrandt introduced his Ostpolitik gradually starting in 1967 with the establishment of diplomatic relations with Romania and making a trade agreement with Czechoslovakia. In 1968 he restored diplomatic relations with Yugoslavia. However the August 1968, Kremlin-controlled invasion of Czechoslovakia by the Warsaw Pact was a profound disappointment. Brandt condemned the invasion and put Ostpolitik on hold while he negotiated a coalition with the Free Democrats. In late 1969 he indicated his readiness to meet with East German leadership on the basis of equality, without preconditions. He also expressed an eagerness to meet with the USSR and Poland to resolve frontier questions that had remained unsettled since 1945. Brandt met with the East German premier [[Willi Stoph]] in 1970. Brandt made a six-point proposal that would involve two separate German states that respected each other's territorial integrity and settle disputes peacefully. They would cooperate as neighbors and the rights of the Four Powers in Berlin would be respected by both of them, and finally that the situation around Berlin would be improved. No agreements were reached at first but talks continued. In 1970 Brandt signed a treaty with the Soviet Union which normalised relations and recognized existing national boundaries. The treaty with Poland in December 1970 accepted the current boundaries, which had long been in dispute. The Berlin question was settled in 1971 to West Germany's satisfaction.  The crowning step came with the Basic Treaty with East Germany.  The status quo was legitimized, relations were formalized  on the basis of equality, and both Germanies joined the United Nations in 1973.<ref>Frank W. Thackeray  and John E. Findling, eds. ''Statesmen Who Changed the World: A Bio-Bibliographical Dictionary of Diplomacy'' (Greenwood, 1993) pp 60-63</ref>\n\n''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine in the U.S. named Brandt as its [[Time Person of the Year|Man of the Year]] for 1970, stating, \"Willy Brandt is in effect seeking to end World War II by bringing about a fresh relationship between East and West. He is trying to accept the real situation in Europe, which has lasted for 25 years, but he is also trying to bring about a new reality in his bold approach to the Soviet Union and the East Bloc.\"<ref>\"Willy Brandt\", ''Time Magazine'', 4 January 1971, [http://www.time.com/time/subscriber/personoftheyear/archive/stories/1970.htmlo online archive].

The [[Foreign policy of the Richard Nixon administration|Nixon policies]] amounted to co-opting Brandt's Ostpolitik.<ref>{{harvp|Juneau|2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 1971, Brandt received the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] for his work in improving [[international relation|relations]] with East Germany, Poland, and the Soviet Union. Brandt negotiated a peace treaty with Poland, and agreements on the boundaries between the two countries, signifying the official and long-delayed end of [[World War II]]. Brandt negotiated parallel treaties and agreements with Czechoslovakia.\n\n[[File:Meeting to discuss US-West German relations - NARA - 194507.tif|thumb|Brandt with U.S. President [[Richard Nixon]] and [[Henry Kissinger]], 2 May 1973]]\nIn West Germany, Brandt's ''Neue Ostpolitik'' was extremely controversial, dividing the populace into two camps. One camp embraced all of the conservative parties, and most notably those West German residents and their families who had been driven west (\"die [[Heimatvertriebenen]]\") by Stalinist [[ethnic cleansing]] from [[Historical Eastern Germany]], especially the part that was given to Poland as a consequence of the end of the war; western [[Czechoslovakia]] (the [[Sudetenland]]); and the rest of Eastern Europe, such as in [[Romania]]. These groups of displaced Germans and their descendants loudly voiced their opposition to Brandt's policy, calling it \"illegal\" and \"high treason\".\n\nA different camp supported and encouraged Brandt's ''Neue Ostpolitik'' as aiming at \"Wandel durch Ann\u00e4herung\" (\"change through [[rapprochement]]\"), encouraging change through a policy of engagement with the (communist) [[Eastern Bloc]], rather than trying to isolate those countries diplomatically and commercially. Brandt's supporters claim that the policy did help to break down the Eastern Bloc's \"[[siege mentality]]\", and also helped to increase its awareness of the contradictions in its brand of Socialism/Communism, which \u2013 together with other events \u2013 eventually led to the downfall of Eastern European Communism.\n\n=== Domestic policies ===\n\n==== Brandt's popularity ====\n[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F064862-0019, Dortmund, SPD-Parteitag, Willy Brandt.jpg|thumb|left|Willy Brandt talking at an [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] meeting in [[Dortmund]], 1983]]\n\nBrandt's predecessor as chancellor, [[Kurt Georg Kiesinger]], had been a member of the Nazi party, and was a more old-fashioned conservative-liberal intellectual. Brandt, having fought the Nazis and having faced down communist Eastern Germany during several crises while he was the mayor of Berlin, became a controversial, but credible, figure in several different factions. As the Minister of Foreign Affairs in Kiesinger's [[grand coalition]] cabinet, Brandt helped to gain further international approval for Western Germany, and he laid the foundation stones for his future ''Neue Ostpolitik''. There was a wide public-opinion gap between Kiesinger and Brandt in the West German polls.\n\nBoth men had come to their own terms with the new baby boomer lifestyles. Kiesinger considered them to be \"a shameful crowd of long-haired drop-outs who needed a bath and someone to discipline them\". On the other hand, Brandt needed a while to get into contact with, and to earn credibility among, the \"[[Ausserparlamentarische Opposition]]\" (APO) (\"the extra-parliamentary opposition\"). The students questioned West German society in general, seeking social, legal, and political reforms. Also, the unrest led to a renaissance of right-wing parties in some of the [[Bundesland (Germany)|Bundeslands]]' (German states under the Bundesrepublik) Parliaments.\n\nBrandt, however, represented a figure of change, and he followed a course of social, legal, and political reforms. In 1969, Brandt gained a small majority by forming a coalition with the FDP. In his first speech before the Bundestag as the chancellor, Brandt set forth his political course of reforms ending the speech with his famous words, \"Wir wollen mehr Demokratie wagen\" (literally: \"Let's dare more democracy\", or more figuratively, \"We want to take a chance on more Democracy\"). This speech made Brandt, as well as the Social Democratic Party, popular among most of the students and other young West German baby-boomers who dreamed of a country that would be more open and more colorful than the frugal and still somewhat-authoritarian Bundesrepublik that had been built after World War II. However, Brandt's ''Neue Ostpolitik'' lost him a large part of the German refugee voters from East Germany, who had been significantly pro-SPD in the postwar years.\n{{Social democracy sidebar |expanded=People}}\n\n=== Chancellor of domestic reform ===\nAlthough Brandt is perhaps best known for his achievements in foreign policy, his government oversaw the implementation of a broad range of social reforms, and was known as a \"Kanzler der inneren Reformen\" ('Chancellor of domestic reform').<ref name=\"Radice\">{{harvp|Radice|Radice|1986}}</ref> According to the historian [[David Childs]], \"Brandt was anxious that his government should be a reforming administration and a number of reforms were embarked upon\".<ref name=\"Childs\">{{harvp|Childs|1992}}</ref> Within a few years, the education budget rose from 16 billion to 50 billion DM, while one out of every three DM spent by the new government was devoted to welfare purposes.

Employees who qualified as disabled and had worked for at least thirty-five years were extended a more generous retirement window, which ranged between the ages of 60 and 62.

In October 1970, FDP deputies [[Erich Mende]], Heinz Starke, and Siegfried Zoglmann crossed the floor to join the CDU. On 23 February 1972, SPD deputy [[Herbert Hupka]], who was also leader of the ''[[Federation of Expellees|Bund der Vertriebenen]]'', joined the CDU in disagreement with Brandt's reconciliatory efforts towards the east. On 23 April 1972, Wilhelm Helms (FDP) left the coalition. The FDP politicians Knud von K\u00fchlmann-Stumm and Gerhard Kienbaum also declared that they would vote against Brandt; thus, Brandt had lost his majority. On 24 April 1972 a [[constructive vote of no confidence]] was proposed and it was voted on three days later. Had this motion passed, CDU leader [[Rainer Barzel]] would have replaced Brandt as chancellor.\n\nOn paper, the opposition now had 250 votes, just one over the 249 needed to oust Brandt. Even Brandt himself believed he was finished, and a number of unions went on strike in anticipation of Brandt's expected defeat on the floor of the Bundestag. To everyone's surprise, the motion failed: Barzel got only 247 votes out of 260 votes cast, two short of what he needed to become Chancellor. There were also 10 votes against the motion and three invalid ballots. Most SPD and FDP deputies abstained, which had the same effect as voting for Brandt. After [[German reunification]], it emerged that the [[Stasi]] had bribed several CDU deputies to abstain from the confidence vote, since East Berlin saw a need for Brandt to stay in power.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\n=== New elections ===\nThough Brandt remained chancellor, he had lost his majority. Subsequent initiatives in parliament, most notably on the budget, failed. Because of this stalemate, the Bundestag was dissolved and new elections were called. During the 1972 campaign, many popular West German artists, intellectuals, writers, actors and professors supported Brandt and the SPD. Among them were [[G\u00fcnter Grass]], [[Walter Jens]], and even the [[soccer]] player [[Paul Breitner]]. Brandt's ''{{Lang|de|Ostpolitik}}'' as well as his reformist domestic policies were popular with parts of the young generation and he led the SPD to its best-ever federal election result in late 1972. The ''{{Lang|de|Willy-Wahl}}'', Brandt's landslide win was the beginning of the end; and Brandt's role in government started to decline.\n\nMany of Brandt's reforms met with resistance from state governments (dominated by CDU/CSU). The spirit of reformist optimism was cut short by the [[1973 oil crisis]] and the major public services strike 1974, which gave Germany's trade unions, led by [[Heinz Kluncker]], a big wage increase but reduced Brandt's financial leeway for further reforms. Brandt was said to be more a dreamer than a manager and was personally haunted by depression. To counter any notions about being sympathetic to Communism or soft on [[left-wing politics|left-wing]] extremists, Brandt implemented tough legislation that barred \"radicals\" from public service (''{{Lang|de|[[Radikalenerlass]]}}'').\n\n=== Guillaume affair ===\n{{main | Guillaume Affair}}\nAround 1973, West German security organizations received information that one of Brandt's personal assistants, [[G\u00fcnter Guillaume]], was a spy for the East German intelligence services. Brandt was asked to continue working as usual, and he agreed to do so, even taking a private vacation with Guillaume. Guillaume was arrested on 24 April 1974, and many{{who|date=August 2015}} blamed Brandt for having a communist spy in his inner circle.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nBrandt resigned from his position as chancellor on 6 May 1974, but he remained a member of the [[Bundestag]] and chairman of the Social Democrats through 1987.\nThis [[espionage]] affair is widely considered to have been just the trigger for Brandt's resignation, not the fundamental cause. As Brandt himself later said, \"I was exhausted, for reasons which had nothing to do with the affair [the Guillaume espionage scandal] going on at the time.\"<ref>quoted in: Gregor Sch\u00f6llgen. [http://www.zeit.de/2003/40/P-Schreiber?page=all ''Der Kanzler und sein Spion'']. In: ''[[Die Zeit]]'' 2003, Vol. 40, 25 September 2003</ref>\nBrandt was dogged by scandals about serial adultery, and reportedly also struggled with alcohol and depression.<ref>{{harvp|Sch\u00f6llgen|2001}}</ref> There was also the economic fallout on West Germany of the [[1973 oil crisis]], which may seem to have given enough stress to finish off Brandt as the Chancellor.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nGuillaume had been an espionage agent for [[East Germany]], who was supervised by [[Markus Wolf]], the head of the \n[[Main Directorate for Reconnaissance]] (''Hauptverwaltung Aufkl\u00e4rung'' or HVA\u2014the foreign intelligence service) of the East German Ministry for State Security. Wolf stated after the reunification that the resignation of Brandt had never been intended, and that the planting and handling of Guillaume had been one of the biggest mistakes of the East German secret services.\n\nBrandt was succeeded as the Chancellor of the Bundesrepublik by his fellow Social Democrat, [[Helmut Schmidt]]. For the rest of his life, Brandt remained suspicious that his fellow Social Democrat (and longtime rival) [[Herbert Wehner]] had been scheming for Brandt's downfall.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}} However, there is scant evidence to corroborate this suspicion.\n\n== Ex-Chancellor ==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F079282-0022, M\u00fcnster, SPD-Parteitag, Willy Brandt.jpg|thumb|upright|Willy Brandt in 1988 at the M\u00fcnster party rally]]\nAfter his term as the Chancellor, Brandt retained his seat in the [[Bundestag]], and he remained the Chairman of the Social Democratic Party through 1987. Beginning in 1987, Brandt stepped down to become the Honorary Chairman of the party. Brandt was also a member of the [[European Parliament]] from 1979 to 1983.\n\n=== Socialist International ===\n[[File:WillyBrandtBerntCarlssonPenttiV\u00e4\u00e4n\u00e4nen.jpg|thumb|left|[[Socialist International]] Congress 1983. Willy Brandt with outgoing general secretary [[Bernt Carlsson]] (left) and new general secretary Pentti V\u00e4\u00e4n\u00e4nen (right)]]\nFor sixteen years, Brandt was the president of the [[Socialist International]] (1976\u201392), during which period the number of Socialist International's mainly European member parties grew until there were more than a hundred socialist, social democratic, and labour political parties around the world. For the first seven years, this growth in SI membership had been prompted by the efforts of the Socialist International's Secretary-General, the Swede [[Bernt Carlsson]]. However, in early 1983, a dispute arose about what Carlsson perceived as the SI president's authoritarian approach. Carlsson then rebuked Brandt saying: \"this is a Socialist International \u2013 not a German International\".\n\nNext, against some vocal opposition, Brandt decided to move the next Socialist International Congress from [[Sydney, Australia]] to [[Portugal]]. Following this SI Congress in April 1983, Brandt retaliated against Carlsson by forcing him to step down from his position. However, the [[Austria]]n [[Prime Minister]], [[Bruno Kreisky]], argued on behalf of Brandt: \"It is a question of whether it is better to be pure or to have greater numbers\".<ref>{{cite journal\n | title = Never at a Loss for Words\n | journal = [[Time (magazine)|Time]]\n | date = 18 April 1983\n | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,953794-1,00.html\n | accessdate = 9 July 2008}}</ref>\nCarlsson was succeeded by the Finn Pentti V\u00e4\u00e4n\u00e4nen as Secretary General of the [[Socialist International]] <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.socialistinternational.org/viewArticle.cfm?ArticleID=8 |title=Progressive Politics For A Fairer World |publisher=Socialist International |accessdate=14 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nDuring Willy Brandt's presidency the SI developed activities and dialogue on a number of International issues. This concerned the East-West conflict and arms race where the SI held high level consultations with the leaderships of the United States and the Soviet Union. The SI met with such leaders as President [[Jimmy Carter]] and Vice-Presidents [[Walter Mondale]] and George Bush. They also met with the Secretaries General Leonid Brezhnev and [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] and with the Soviet President Andrei Gromyko. The SI also developed active contacts to promote dialogue concerning regional conflicts. Those included the Middle East, where they helped to build contacts between Israel and the PLO, and also in Southern Africa and Central America.<ref>{{harvp|V\u00e4\u00e4n\u00e4nen|2012|pp=258\u2013259}}</ref>\n\n=== Brandt Report ===\nIn 1977, Brandt was appointed as the chairman of the Independent Commission for International Developmental Issues. This produced a report in 1980, which called for drastic changes in the global attitude towards development in the Third World. This became known as the [[Brandt Report]].\n\n=== Reunification ===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1990-0316-035, Wismar, SPD-Wahlkundgebung, Willy Brandt.jpg|thumb|left|Willy Brandt giving a speech in [[Wismar]], campaigning for the [[1990 East German general election|only free parliamentary election in East Germany]] (March 1990).]]\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1990-0928-036, Dessau, SPD-Wahlkundgebung, Willy Brandt.jpg|thumb|left|Willy Brandt giving a speech on 28 September 1990, two years before his death.]]\nIn October 1979, Brandt met with the East German dissident, [[Rudolf Bahro]], who had written ''The Alternative''. Bahro and his supporters were attacked by the East German state security organization [[Stasi]], headed by [[Erich Mielke]], for his writings, which had laid the theoretical foundation of a left-wing opposition to the ruling SED party and its dependent allies, and which promoted new and changed parties. All of this is now described as \"change from within\". Brandt had asked for Bahro's release, and Brandt welcomed Bahro's theories, which advanced the debate within his own Social Democratic Party.\n\nOn 11 September 1988, Brandt described the hope for [[German reunification]] as a delusion.<ref>{{cite web|title=Schlaglichter der deutschen Einheit.

Brandt's public statement \"Now grows together what belongs together\", was widely quoted in those days.\n\n=== Hostages in Iraq ===\nOne of Brandt's last public appearances was in flying to [[Baghdad]], [[Iraq]], to free Western hostages held by [[Saddam Hussein]], following the Iraqi invasion of [[Kuwait]] in 1990. Brandt secured the release of a large number of them, and on 9 November 1990, his [[airplane]] landed with 174 freed hostages on board at the [[Frankfurt Airport]].<ref>\"Mideast Tensions\", [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE7DB1238F933A25752C1A966958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=MIDEAST TENSIONS; Buildup in Gulf Seen as a Signal On Use of Force], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 9 November 1990.

Brandt was originally considered one of the leaders of the right wing of the SPD, and earned initial fame as [[Governing Mayor of Berlin|Governing Mayor]] of [[West Berlin]]. He served as [[Minister for Foreign Affairs (Germany)|Foreign Minister]] and as [[Vice-Chancellor of Germany|Vice Chancellor]] in [[Kurt Georg Kiesinger]]'s cabinet, and became chancellor in 1969. As chancellor, he maintained West Germany's close alignment with the [[United States]] and focused on strengthening [[European integration]] in western Europe, while launching the new policy of ''[[Ostpolitik]]'' aimed at improving relations with Eastern Europe. Brandt was controversial on both the right wing, for his ''Ostpolitik'', and on the left wing, for his support of American policies, including the [[Vietnam War]], and [[right-wing authoritarian]] regimes. The [[Brandt Report]] became a recognised measure for describing the general [[North-South divide]] in world economics and politics between an affluent North and a poor South. Brandt was also known for his fierce [[anti-communist]] policies at the domestic level, culminating in the ''[[Radikalenerlass]]'' (Anti-Radical Decree) in 1972.\n\nBrandt resigned as chancellor in 1974, after [[G\u00fcnter Guillaume]], one of his closest aides, [[Guillaume Affair|was exposed]] as an agent of the [[Stasi]], the [[GDR|East German]] [[secret service]].\n\n== Early life and the Second World War ==\nWilly Brandt was born Herbert Ernst Carl Frahm in the [[Free City of L\u00fcbeck]] ([[German Empire]]) on 18 December 1913.<ref>{{cite book|last=Jessup|first=John E.|title=An Encyclopedic Dictionary of Conflict and Conflict Resolution, 1945\u20131996|year=1998|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=Westport, CT|page=89|url=https://www.questia.com/read/106899354/an-encyclopedic-dictionary-of-conflict-and-conflict}} {{Subscription required|via=Questia}}</ref> His mother was Martha Frahm (16 March 1894 \u2013 3 August 1969){{citation needed|date=January 2018}} a [[single parent]], who worked as a cashier for a department store.

As his mother worked six days a week, he was mainly brought up by his mother's stepfather, Ludwig Frahm (1875\u20131935), and his second wife, Dora.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nHe joined the \"Socialist Youth\" in 1929 and the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]] (SPD) in 1930. He left the SPD to join the more left wing [[SAPD|Socialist Workers Party]] (SAP), which was allied to the [[Workers' Party of Marxist Unification|POUM]] in [[Spain]] and the [[Independent Labour Party]] in [[UK|Britain]]. After passing his [[Abitur]] in 1932 at ''Johanneum zu L\u00fcbeck'', he became an apprentice at the shipbroker and ship's agent F.&nbsp;H. Bertling. In 1933, using his connections with the port and its ships, he left Germany for [[Norway]] to escape [[Nazism|Nazi]] persecution. It was at this time that he adopted the [[pseudonym]] '''Willy Brandt''' to avoid detection by Nazi agents. In 1934, he took part in the founding of the [[International Bureau of Revolutionary Youth Organizations]], and was elected to its secretariat.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nBrandt was in Germany from September to December 1936, disguised as a Norwegian student named Gunnar Gaasland. The real Gunnar Gaasland was married to Gertrud Meyer from L\u00fcbeck in a [[marriage of convenience]] to protect her from deportation. Meyer had joined Brandt in Norway in July 1933. In 1937, during the [[Spanish Civil War|Civil War]], Brandt worked in [[Spain]] as a journalist. In 1938, the German government revoked his citizenship, so he applied for [[Norwegian nationality law|Norwegian citizenship]]. In 1940, he was arrested in Norway by occupying German forces, but was not identified as he wore a Norwegian uniform. On his release, he escaped to [[Sweden during World War II|neutral Sweden]]. In August 1940, he became a Norwegian citizen, receiving his passport from the [[Norwegian legation in Stockholm|Norwegian legation]] in [[Stockholm]], where he lived until the end of the war. Willy Brandt lectured in Sweden on 1 December 1940 at [[Bommersvik]] College about problems experienced by the [[social democrats]] in [[Nazi Germany]] and the occupied countries at the start of the [[Second World War]]. In exile in Norway and Sweden, Brandt learned [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] and [[Swedish language|Swedish]]. Brandt spoke Norwegian fluently, and retained a close relationship with Norway.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nIn late 1946, Brandt returned to [[Berlin]], working for the Norwegian government. In 1948, he joined the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD) and became a German citizen again, formally adopting the pseudonym Willy Brandt as his legal name.\n\n== Politician ==\nBrandt was elected to the West German [[Bundestag]] (the federal parliament) in the [[1949 West German federal election]] as a [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] delegate from West Berlin, serving there until 1957. Concurrently, he was elected as an SPD representative to the [[Abgeordnetenhaus of Berlin|Abgeordnetenhaus]] (the state-level parliament) of West Berlin in the [[1950 West Berlin state election]], and served there through 1971. In the [[1969 West German federal election]] he was again elected to the Bundestag, but as a delegate from [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], and remained in the Bundestag as a delegate from that state until his death in 1992.<ref name=\"Noack\">{{cite book |last1=Noack |first1=Hans-Joachim |title=Willy Brandt: Ein Leben, ein Jahrhundert |date=2013 |publisher=Rowohlt |location=Berlin |isbn=978-3871346453}}</ref>\n\nIn 1950, Brandt, while a member of the Bundestag and the editor-in-chief of the ''Berliner Stadtblatt'', received a secret payment of about 170,000 Deutsche Mark from the U.S. government ({{Inflation|DE|170000|1950|fmt=eq|cursign=\u20ac}}).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/inland/historiker-enthuellt-washington-unterstuetzte-willy-brandt-mit-geheimen-zahlungen-14280080.html |title=Washington unterst\u00fctzte Willy Brandt mit geheimen Zahlungen  |newspaper=faz.net}}</ref> He denied any contribution to the topic.\n\n[[File:Willy Brandt (1959).jpg|right|thumb|Brandt in 1959 as [[Governing Mayor of Berlin|Governing Mayor of West Berlin]]]]\n \nFrom 3 October 1957 to 1966, Willy Brandt served as [[Governing Mayor of Berlin|Governing Mayor of West Berlin]], during a period of increasing tension in East-West relations that led to the construction of the [[Berlin Wall]].

Brandt was an outspoken critic of Soviet repression of the 1956 [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungarian Uprising]] and of [[Nikita Khrushchev]]'s 1958 proposal that Berlin receive the status of a \"[[City-state|free city]]\". He was supported by the influential publisher [[Axel Springer]]. As mayor of West Berlin, Brandt accomplished much in the way of urban development. New hotels, office-blocks and flats were constructed, while both [[Schloss Charlottenburg]] and the [[Reichstag building]] were restored. Sections of the \"Stadtring\" [[Bundesautobahn 100]] [[inner city]] motorway were opened, while a major housing programme was carried out, with roughly 20,000 new dwellings built each year during his time in office.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://spartacus-educational.com/GERbrandtW.htm |title=Willy Brandt : Biography |publisher=Spartacus-Educational.com |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111009112249/http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/GERbrandtW.htm |archivedate=9 October 2011  }}</ref>\n\n[[File:John F.

Kennedy]] saw Brandt as the wave of the future in West Germany and was hoping he would replace [[Konrad Adenauer]] as chancellor following elections later that year.<ref>{{harvp|Kempe|2011|p=98}}</ref> Kennedy made this preference clear by inviting Brandt, the West German opposition leader, to an official meeting at the [[White House]] a month before meeting with Adenauer, the country's leader. The diplomatic snub strained relations between Kennedy and Adenauer further during an especially tense time for Berlin.<ref>{{harvp|Kempe|2011|p=166}}</ref> However, following the building of the Berlin Wall in August 1961, Brandt was disappointed and angry with Kennedy. Speaking in Berlin three days later, Brandt criticized Kennedy, asserting \"Berlin expects more than words. It expects political action.\" He also wrote Kennedy a highly critical public letter in which he warned that the development was liable \"to arouse doubts about the ability of the three [Allied] Powers to react and their determination\" and he called the situation \"a state of accomplished extortion\".<ref>{{harvp|Kempe|2011|pp=375\u2013376}}</ref>\n\nBrandt became the chairman of the SPD in 1964, a post that he retained until 1987, longer than any other party chairman since the founding of the SPD by [[August Bebel]]. Brandt was the SPD candidate for the chancellorship in 1961, but he lost to [[Konrad Adenauer]]'s conservative [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany]] (CDU). In 1965, Brandt ran again, but lost to the popular [[Ludwig Erhard]]. Erhard's government was short-lived, however, and in 1966 a [[grand coalition]] between the SPD and CDU was formed, with Brandt serving as [[foreign minister]] and as the 5th [[Vice-Chancellor of Germany]].\n\n== Chancellor ==\nAt the 1969 elections, again with Brandt as the leading candidate, the SPD became stronger, and after three weeks of negotiations, the SPD [[Social-liberal coalition|formed a coalition]] government with the smaller [[Free Democratic Party of Germany]] (FDP). Brandt was elected [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany]].\n\n=== Foreign policy ===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F037099-0021, K\u00f6ln, Staatsempfang f\u00fcr Pr\u00e4sident Pompidou.jpg|thumb|Willy Brandt with [[France|French]] president [[Georges Pompidou]] in [[Cologne]], 3 July 1972.]]\n\nAs chancellor, Brandt developed his ''[[Neue Ostpolitik]]'' (''New Eastern Policy'') by stages. Brandt was active in creating a degree of rapprochement with [[East Germany]], and also in improving relations with the Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and other [[Eastern Bloc]] (communist) countries.\n\nBrandt introduced his Ostpolitik gradually starting in 1967 with the establishment of diplomatic relations with Romania and making a trade agreement with Czechoslovakia. In 1968 he restored diplomatic relations with Yugoslavia. However the August 1968, Kremlin-controlled invasion of Czechoslovakia by the Warsaw Pact was a profound disappointment. Brandt condemned the invasion and put Ostpolitik on hold while he negotiated a coalition with the Free Democrats. In late 1969 he indicated his readiness to meet with East German leadership on the basis of equality, without preconditions. He also expressed an eagerness to meet with the USSR and Poland to resolve frontier questions that had remained unsettled since 1945. Brandt met with the East German premier [[Willi Stoph]] in 1970. Brandt made a six-point proposal that would involve two separate German states that respected each other's territorial integrity and settle disputes peacefully. They would cooperate as neighbors and the rights of the Four Powers in Berlin would be respected by both of them, and finally that the situation around Berlin would be improved. No agreements were reached at first but talks continued. In 1970 Brandt signed a treaty with the Soviet Union which normalised relations and recognized existing national boundaries. The treaty with Poland in December 1970 accepted the current boundaries, which had long been in dispute. The Berlin question was settled in 1971 to West Germany's satisfaction.  The crowning step came with the Basic Treaty with East Germany.  The status quo was legitimized, relations were formalized  on the basis of equality, and both Germanies joined the United Nations in 1973.<ref>Frank W. Thackeray  and John E. Findling, eds. ''Statesmen Who Changed the World: A Bio-Bibliographical Dictionary of Diplomacy'' (Greenwood, 1993) pp 60-63</ref>\n\n''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine in the U.S. named Brandt as its [[Time Person of the Year|Man of the Year]] for 1970, stating, \"Willy Brandt is in effect seeking to end World War II by bringing about a fresh relationship between East and West. He is trying to accept the real situation in Europe, which has lasted for 25 years, but he is also trying to bring about a new reality in his bold approach to the Soviet Union and the East Bloc.\"<ref>\"Willy Brandt\", ''Time Magazine'', 4 January 1971, [http://www.time.com/time/subscriber/personoftheyear/archive/stories/1970.htmlo online archive].

The [[Foreign policy of the Richard Nixon administration|Nixon policies]] amounted to co-opting Brandt's Ostpolitik.<ref>{{harvp|Juneau|2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 1971, Brandt received the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] for his work in improving [[international relation|relations]] with East Germany, Poland, and the Soviet Union. Brandt negotiated a peace treaty with Poland, and agreements on the boundaries between the two countries, signifying the official and long-delayed end of [[World War II]]. Brandt negotiated parallel treaties and agreements with Czechoslovakia.\n\n[[File:Meeting to discuss US-West German relations - NARA - 194507.tif|thumb|Brandt with U.S. President [[Richard Nixon]] and [[Henry Kissinger]], 2 May 1973]]\nIn West Germany, Brandt's ''Neue Ostpolitik'' was extremely controversial, dividing the populace into two camps. One camp embraced all of the conservative parties, and most notably those West German residents and their families who had been driven west (\"die [[Heimatvertriebenen]]\") by Stalinist [[ethnic cleansing]] from [[Historical Eastern Germany]], especially the part that was given to Poland as a consequence of the end of the war; western [[Czechoslovakia]] (the [[Sudetenland]]); and the rest of Eastern Europe, such as in [[Romania]]. These groups of displaced Germans and their descendants loudly voiced their opposition to Brandt's policy, calling it \"illegal\" and \"high treason\".\n\nA different camp supported and encouraged Brandt's ''Neue Ostpolitik'' as aiming at \"Wandel durch Ann\u00e4herung\" (\"change through [[rapprochement]]\"), encouraging change through a policy of engagement with the (communist) [[Eastern Bloc]], rather than trying to isolate those countries diplomatically and commercially. Brandt's supporters claim that the policy did help to break down the Eastern Bloc's \"[[siege mentality]]\", and also helped to increase its awareness of the contradictions in its brand of Socialism/Communism, which \u2013 together with other events \u2013 eventually led to the downfall of Eastern European Communism.\n\n=== Domestic policies ===\n\n==== Brandt's popularity ====\n[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F064862-0019, Dortmund, SPD-Parteitag, Willy Brandt.jpg|thumb|left|Willy Brandt talking at an [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] meeting in [[Dortmund]], 1983]]\n\nBrandt's predecessor as chancellor, [[Kurt Georg Kiesinger]], had been a member of the Nazi party, and was a more old-fashioned conservative-liberal intellectual. Brandt, having fought the Nazis and having faced down communist Eastern Germany during several crises while he was the mayor of Berlin, became a controversial, but credible, figure in several different factions. As the Minister of Foreign Affairs in Kiesinger's [[grand coalition]] cabinet, Brandt helped to gain further international approval for Western Germany, and he laid the foundation stones for his future ''Neue Ostpolitik''. There was a wide public-opinion gap between Kiesinger and Brandt in the West German polls.\n\nBoth men had come to their own terms with the new baby boomer lifestyles. Kiesinger considered them to be \"a shameful crowd of long-haired drop-outs who needed a bath and someone to discipline them\". On the other hand, Brandt needed a while to get into contact with, and to earn credibility among, the \"[[Ausserparlamentarische Opposition]]\" (APO) (\"the extra-parliamentary opposition\"). The students questioned West German society in general, seeking social, legal, and political reforms. Also, the unrest led to a renaissance of right-wing parties in some of the [[Bundesland (Germany)|Bundeslands]]' (German states under the Bundesrepublik) Parliaments.\n\nBrandt, however, represented a figure of change, and he followed a course of social, legal, and political reforms. In 1969, Brandt gained a small majority by forming a coalition with the FDP. In his first speech before the Bundestag as the chancellor, Brandt set forth his political course of reforms ending the speech with his famous words, \"Wir wollen mehr Demokratie wagen\" (literally: \"Let's dare more democracy\", or more figuratively, \"We want to take a chance on more Democracy\"). This speech made Brandt, as well as the Social Democratic Party, popular among most of the students and other young West German baby-boomers who dreamed of a country that would be more open and more colorful than the frugal and still somewhat-authoritarian Bundesrepublik that had been built after World War II. However, Brandt's ''Neue Ostpolitik'' lost him a large part of the German refugee voters from East Germany, who had been significantly pro-SPD in the postwar years.\n{{Social democracy sidebar |expanded=People}}\n\n=== Chancellor of domestic reform ===\nAlthough Brandt is perhaps best known for his achievements in foreign policy, his government oversaw the implementation of a broad range of social reforms, and was known as a \"Kanzler der inneren Reformen\" ('Chancellor of domestic reform').<ref name=\"Radice\">{{harvp|Radice|Radice|1986}}</ref> According to the historian [[David Childs]], \"Brandt was anxious that his government should be a reforming administration and a number of reforms were embarked upon\".<ref name=\"Childs\">{{harvp|Childs|1992}}</ref> Within a few years, the education budget rose from 16 billion to 50 billion DM, while one out of every three DM spent by the new government was devoted to welfare purposes.

In September 1971, an ordinance was published concerning dangerous working materials; safeguarding persons using these materials against the dangers involved.\n\nBy a decree of the Federal Minister for Labour and Social Order, the Federal Institute for Industrial Protection became the Federal Agency for Industrial Protection and Accident Research. Amongst its designated tasks included the promotion of industrial protection, accident prevention on the journey to and from work and accident prevention in the home and leisure activities, the encouragement of training and advanced training in the area of industrial protection, and to promote and coordinate accident research.

The legislation regulated the establishment of so-called \"L\u00e4rmschutzzonen\" (protection areas against aircraft noise) for all 11 international airports and for those 34 military airports used for jet aircraft, and the law also authorised the Federal Department of the Interior to decree protection areas for each of those mentioned airports with approval by the \"Bundesrat\", the representation of the German Federal States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mapcontext.com/autocarto/proceedings/auto-carto-4-vol-1/pdf/automated-cartography-as-an-aid-to-define-protection-areas-against-air-traffic-noise.pdf|title=Automated cartography as an aid to decree protection areas against air traffic noise|author=Theodor M.

In October 1970, FDP deputies [[Erich Mende]], Heinz Starke, and Siegfried Zoglmann crossed the floor to join the CDU. On 23 February 1972, SPD deputy [[Herbert Hupka]], who was also leader of the ''[[Federation of Expellees|Bund der Vertriebenen]]'', joined the CDU in disagreement with Brandt's reconciliatory efforts towards the east. On 23 April 1972, Wilhelm Helms (FDP) left the coalition. The FDP politicians Knud von K\u00fchlmann-Stumm and Gerhard Kienbaum also declared that they would vote against Brandt; thus, Brandt had lost his majority. On 24 April 1972 a [[constructive vote of no confidence]] was proposed and it was voted on three days later. Had this motion passed, CDU leader [[Rainer Barzel]] would have replaced Brandt as chancellor.\n\nOn paper, the opposition now had 250 votes, just one over the 249 needed to oust Brandt. Even Brandt himself believed he was finished, and a number of unions went on strike in anticipation of Brandt's expected defeat on the floor of the Bundestag. To everyone's surprise, the motion failed: Barzel got only 247 votes out of 260 votes cast, two short of what he needed to become Chancellor. There were also 10 votes against the motion and three invalid ballots. Most SPD and FDP deputies abstained, which had the same effect as voting for Brandt. After [[German reunification]], it emerged that the [[Stasi]] had bribed several CDU deputies to abstain from the confidence vote, since East Berlin saw a need for Brandt to stay in power.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\n=== New elections ===\nThough Brandt remained chancellor, he had lost his majority. Subsequent initiatives in parliament, most notably on the budget, failed. Because of this stalemate, the Bundestag was dissolved and new elections were called. During the 1972 campaign, many popular West German artists, intellectuals, writers, actors and professors supported Brandt and the SPD. Among them were [[G\u00fcnter Grass]], [[Walter Jens]], and even the [[soccer]] player [[Paul Breitner]]. Brandt's ''{{Lang|de|Ostpolitik}}'' as well as his reformist domestic policies were popular with parts of the young generation and he led the SPD to its best-ever federal election result in late 1972. The ''{{Lang|de|Willy-Wahl}}'', Brandt's landslide win was the beginning of the end; and Brandt's role in government started to decline.\n\nMany of Brandt's reforms met with resistance from state governments (dominated by CDU/CSU). The spirit of reformist optimism was cut short by the [[1973 oil crisis]] and the major public services strike 1974, which gave Germany's trade unions, led by [[Heinz Kluncker]], a big wage increase but reduced Brandt's financial leeway for further reforms. Brandt was said to be more a dreamer than a manager and was personally haunted by depression. To counter any notions about being sympathetic to Communism or soft on [[left-wing politics|left-wing]] extremists, Brandt implemented tough legislation that barred \"radicals\" from public service (''{{Lang|de|[[Radikalenerlass]]}}'').\n\n=== Guillaume affair ===\n{{main | Guillaume Affair}}\nAround 1973, West German security organizations received information that one of Brandt's personal assistants, [[G\u00fcnter Guillaume]], was a spy for the East German intelligence services. Brandt was asked to continue working as usual, and he agreed to do so, even taking a private vacation with Guillaume. Guillaume was arrested on 24 April 1974, and many{{who|date=August 2015}} blamed Brandt for having a communist spy in his inner circle.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nBrandt resigned from his position as chancellor on 6 May 1974, but he remained a member of the [[Bundestag]] and chairman of the Social Democrats through 1987.\nThis [[espionage]] affair is widely considered to have been just the trigger for Brandt's resignation, not the fundamental cause. As Brandt himself later said, \"I was exhausted, for reasons which had nothing to do with the affair [the Guillaume espionage scandal] going on at the time.\"<ref>quoted in: Gregor Sch\u00f6llgen. [http://www.zeit.de/2003/40/P-Schreiber?page=all ''Der Kanzler und sein Spion'']. In: ''[[Die Zeit]]'' 2003, Vol. 40, 25 September 2003</ref>\nBrandt was dogged by scandals about serial adultery, and reportedly also struggled with alcohol and depression.<ref>{{harvp|Sch\u00f6llgen|2001}}</ref> There was also the economic fallout on West Germany of the [[1973 oil crisis]], which may seem to have given enough stress to finish off Brandt as the Chancellor.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nGuillaume had been an espionage agent for [[East Germany]], who was supervised by [[Markus Wolf]], the head of the \n[[Main Directorate for Reconnaissance]] (''Hauptverwaltung Aufkl\u00e4rung'' or HVA\u2014the foreign intelligence service) of the East German Ministry for State Security. Wolf stated after the reunification that the resignation of Brandt had never been intended, and that the planting and handling of Guillaume had been one of the largest mistakes of the East German secret services.\n\nBrandt was succeeded as the Chancellor of the Bundesrepublik by his fellow Social Democrat, [[Helmut Schmidt]]. For the rest of his life, Brandt remained suspicious that his fellow Social Democrat (and longtime rival) [[Herbert Wehner]] had been scheming for Brandt's downfall.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}} However, there is scant evidence to corroborate this suspicion.\n\n== Ex-Chancellor ==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F079282-0022, M\u00fcnster, SPD-Parteitag, Willy Brandt.jpg|thumb|upright|Willy Brandt in 1988 at the M\u00fcnster party rally]]\nAfter his term as the Chancellor, Brandt retained his seat in the [[Bundestag]], and he remained the Chairman of the Social Democratic Party through 1987. Beginning in 1987, Brandt stepped down to become the Honorary Chairman of the party. Brandt was also a member of the [[European Parliament]] from 1979 to 1983.\n\n=== Socialist International ===\n[[File:WillyBrandtBerntCarlssonPenttiV\u00e4\u00e4n\u00e4nen.jpg|thumb|left|[[Socialist International]] Congress 1983.

For the first seven years, this growth in SI membership had been prompted by the efforts of the Socialist International's Secretary-General, the Swede [[Bernt Carlsson]]. However, in early 1983, a dispute arose about what Carlsson perceived as the SI president's authoritarian approach. Carlsson then rebuked Brandt saying: \"this is a Socialist International \u2013 not a German International\".\n\nNext, against some vocal opposition, Brandt decided to move the next Socialist International Congress from [[Sydney, Australia]] to [[Portugal]]. Following this SI Congress in April 1983, Brandt retaliated against Carlsson by forcing him to step down from his position. However, the [[Austria]]n [[Prime Minister]], [[Bruno Kreisky]], argued on behalf of Brandt: \"It is a question of whether it is better to be pure or to have greater numbers\".<ref>{{cite journal\n | title = Never at a Loss for Words\n | journal = [[Time (magazine)|Time]]\n | date = 18 April 1983\n | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,953794-1,00.html\n | accessdate = 9 July 2008}}</ref>\nCarlsson was succeeded by the Finn Pentti V\u00e4\u00e4n\u00e4nen as Secretary General of the [[Socialist International]] <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.socialistinternational.org/viewArticle.cfm?ArticleID=8 |title=Progressive Politics For A Fairer World |publisher=Socialist International |accessdate=14 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nDuring Willy Brandt's presidency the SI developed activities and dialogue on a number of International issues. This concerned the East-West conflict and arms race where the SI held high level consultations with the leaderships of the United States and the Soviet Union. The SI met with such leaders as President [[Jimmy Carter]] and Vice-Presidents [[Walter Mondale]] and George Bush. They also met with the Secretaries General Leonid Brezhnev and [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] and with the Soviet President Andrei Gromyko. The SI also developed active contacts to promote dialogue concerning regional conflicts. Those included the Middle East, where they helped to build contacts between Israel and the PLO, and also in Southern Africa and Central America.<ref>{{harvp|V\u00e4\u00e4n\u00e4nen|2012|pp=258\u2013259}}</ref>\n\n=== Brandt Report ===\nIn 1977, Brandt was appointed as the chairman of the Independent Commission for International Developmental Issues. This produced a report in 1980, which called for drastic changes in the global attitude towards development in the Third World.

Bahro and his supporters were attacked by the East German state security organization [[Stasi]], headed by [[Erich Mielke]], for his writings, which had laid the theoretical foundation of a left-wing opposition to the ruling SED party and its dependent allies, and which promoted new and changed parties. All of this is now described as \"change from within\".
