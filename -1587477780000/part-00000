For the derivation, different conditions must be taken into account and different equations can be obtained.<ref name=\"Elimelech\">M. Elimelech, J. Gregory, X. Jia, R. A. Williams, ''Particle Deposition and Aggregation Measurement: Modelling and Simulation'' (Boston: 1995).</ref> But some useful assumptions can effectively simplify the process, which are suitable for ordinary conditions. The simplified way to derive it is to add the two parts together.\n\n===van der Waals attraction===\n{{main article|van der Waals force}}\nvan der Waals force is actually the total name of dipole-dipole force, dipole-induced dipole force and dispersion forces,<ref name=\"Jacob\">Jacob N. Israelacvili, ''Intermolecular and Surface Forces'' (London 2007).</ref> in which dispersion forces are the most important part because they are always present.\nAssume that the pair potential between two atoms or small molecules is purely attractive and of the form w = -C/r<sup>n</sup>, where C is a constant for interaction energy, decided by the molecule's property and n = 6 for van der Waals attraction.<ref name=\"London\">London, F. (1937), ''Trans Faraday Soc'', '''33''', 8\u201326.</ref> With another assumption of additivity, the net interaction energy between a molecule and planar surface made up of like molecules will be the sum of the interaction energy between the molecule and every molecule in the surface body.<ref name=\"Jacob\" /> So the net interaction energy for a molecule at a distance D away from the surface will therefore be\n\n: <math>w(D) = -2 \\pi \\, C \\rho _1\\, \\int_{z=D}^{z= \\infty \\,}dz \\int_{x=0}^{x=\\infty \\,}\\frac{xdx}{(z^2+x^2)^3} = \\frac{2 \\pi C \\rho _1}{4}\\int_D^{\\infty }\\frac{dz}{z^4} = - \\frac{ \\pi C \\rho _1  }{ 6 D^3 }</math>\n\nwhere \n**''w''(''r'') is the interaction energy between the molecule and the surface\n**<math> \\rho_1 </math> is the number density of the surface.\n**''z'' is the axis perpendicular with the surface and passes across the molecule. ''z'' = D at the point where the molecule is and z = 0 at the surface.\n**''x'' is the axis perpendicular with z axis, where ''x'' = 0 at the intersection.\n\nThen the interaction energy of a large sphere of radius R and a flat surface can be calculated as\n\n: <math>W(D) = -\\frac{2 \\pi C \\rho _1 \\rho _2}{12} \\int_{z=0}^{z=2R}\\frac {(2R-z)zdz}{(D+z)^3} \\approx  -\\frac{ \\pi ^2 C \\rho _1 \\rho _2 R}{6D}</math>\n\nwhere\n** ''W''(''D'') is the interaction energy between the sphere and the surface.\n** <math>\\rho_2</math> is the number density of the sphere\n\nFor convenience, [[Hamaker constant]] A is given as\n\n: <math> A = \\pi^2C\\rho_1\\rho_2 </math>\n\nand the equation will become\n\n: <math>W(D)=-\\frac{AR}{6D} </math>\n\nWith a similar method and according to [[Derjaguin approximation]],<ref name=\"Derjaguin\">Derjaguin B. V. (1934)''Kolloid Zeits'' '''69''', 155\u2013164.</ref> the van der Waals interaction energy between particles with different shapes can be calculated, such as energy between\n\n: two spheres: <math>W(D) = -\\frac{A}{6D} \\frac{R_1 R_2}{(R_1 +R_2 )}</math>\n\n: sphere-surface: <math>W(D) = -\\frac{AR}{6D}</math>\n\n: Two surfaces: <math>W(D) = -\\frac{A}{12 \\pi D^2}</math> per unit area\n\n===Double layer force===\n{{main article|Double layer forces}}\nA surface in a liquid may be charged by dissociation of surface groups (e.g. silanol groups for glass or silica surfaces<ref>\nBehrens, S. H. and Grier, D. G., \n\"The charge on glass and silica surfaces,\" \n''Journal of Chemical Physics'' '''115''', 6716\u20136721 (2001)\n</ref>) or by adsorption of charged molecules such as polyelectrolyte from the surrounding solution. This results in the development of a wall surface potential which will attract counterions from the surrounding solution and repel co-ions. In equilibrium, the surface charge is balanced by oppositely charged counterions in solution. The region near the surface of enhanced\ncounterion concentration is called the electrical double layer (EDL). The EDL can be approximated by a sub-division into two regions. Ions in the region closest to the charged wall surface are strongly bound to the surface. This immobile layer is called the Stern or Helmholtz layer. The region adjacent to the Stern layer is called the diffuse layer and contains loosely associated ions that are comparatively mobile. The total electrical double layer due to the formation of the counterion layers results in electrostatic screening of the wall charge and minimizes the [[Gibbs free energy]] of EDL formation.\n\nThe thickness of the diffuse electric double layer is known as the [[Debye screening length]] <math>1/\\kappa</math>. At a distance of two Debye screening lengths the electrical potential energy is reduced to 2 percent of the value at the surface wall.\n\n: <math>\\kappa = \\sqrt{\\sum_i \\frac{\\rho_{\\infty i} e^2z^2_i}{\\epsilon_r \\epsilon_0 k_{\\rm B} T}}</math>\n\nwith unit of ''m''<sup>&minus;1</sup>\nwhere\n*<math>\\rho_{\\infty i}</math> is the number density of ion i in the bulk solution.\n*''z'' is the valency of the ion.

For the derivation, different conditions must be taken into account and different equations can be obtained.<ref name=\"Elimelech\">M. Elimelech, J. Gregory, X. Jia, R. A. Williams, ''Particle Deposition and Aggregation Measurement: Modelling and Simulation'' (Boston: 1995).</ref> But some useful assumptions can effectively simplify the process, which are suitable for ordinary conditions. The simplified way to derive it is to add the two parts together.\n\n===van der Waals attraction===\n{{main article|van der Waals force}}\nvan der Waals force is actually the total name of dipole-dipole force, dipole-induced dipole force and dispersion forces,<ref name=\"Jacob\">Jacob N. Israelacvili, ''Intermolecular and Surface Forces'' (London 2007).</ref> in which dispersion forces are the most important part because they are always present.\nAssume that the pair potential between two atoms or small molecules is purely attractive and of the form w = -C/r<sup>n</sup>, where C is a constant for interaction energy, decided by the molecule's property and n = 6 for van der Waals attraction.<ref name=\"London\">London, F. (1937), ''Trans Faraday Soc'', '''33''', 8\u201326.</ref> With another assumption of additivity, the net interaction energy between a molecule and planar surface made up of like molecules will be the sum of the interaction energy between the molecule and every molecule in the surface body.<ref name=\"Jacob\" /> So the net interaction energy for a molecule at a distance D away from the surface will therefore be\n\n: <math>w(D) = -2 \\pi \\, C \\rho _1\\, \\int_{z=D}^{z= \\infty \\,}dz \\int_{x=0}^{x=\\infty \\,}\\frac{xdx}{(z^2+x^2)^3} = \\frac{2 \\pi C \\rho _1}{4}\\int_D^{\\infty }\\frac{dz}{z^4} = - \\frac{ \\pi C \\rho _1  }{ 6 D^3 }</math>\n\nwhere \n**''w''(''r'') is the interaction energy between the molecule and the surface\n**<math> \\rho_1 </math> is the number density of the surface.\n**''z'' is the axis perpendicular with the surface and passes across the molecule. ''z'' = D at the point where the molecule is and z = 0 at the surface.\n**''x'' is the axis perpendicular with z axis, where ''x'' = 0 at the intersection.\n\nThen the interaction energy of a large sphere of radius R and a flat surface can be calculated as\n\n: <math>W(D) = -\\frac{2 \\pi C \\rho _1 \\rho _2}{12} \\int_{z=0}^{z=2R}\\frac {(2R-z)zdz}{(D+z)^3} \\approx  -\\frac{ \\pi ^2 C \\rho _1 \\rho _2 R}{6D}</math>\n\nwhere\n** ''W''(''D'') is the interaction energy between the sphere and the surface.\n** <math>\\rho_2</math> is the number density of the sphere\n\nFor convenience, [[Hamaker constant]] A is given as\n\n: <math> A = \\pi^2C\\rho_1\\rho_2 </math>\n\nand the equation will become\n\n: <math>W(D)=-\\frac{AR}{6D} </math>\n\nWith a similar method and according to [[Derjaguin approximation]],<ref name=\"Derjaguin\">Derjaguin B. V. (1934)''Kolloid Zeits'' '''69''', 155\u2013164.</ref> the van der Waals interaction energy between particles with different shapes can be calculated, such as energy between\n\n: two spheres: <math>W(D) = -\\frac{A}{6D} \\frac{R_1 R_2}{(R_1 +R_2 )}</math>\n\n: sphere-surface: <math>W(D) = -\\frac{AR}{6D}</math>\n\n: Two surfaces: <math>W(D) = -\\frac{A}{12 \\pi D^2}</math> per unit area\n\n===Double layer force===\n{{main article|Double layer forces}}\nA surface in a liquid may be charged by dissociation of surface groups (e.g. silanol groups for glass or silica surfaces<ref>\nBehrens, S. H. and Grier, D. G., \n\"The charge on glass and silica surfaces,\" \n''Journal of Chemical Physics'' '''115''', 6716\u20136721 (2001)\n</ref>) or by adsorption of charged molecules such as polyelectrolyte from the surrounding solution. This results in the development of a wall surface potential which will attract counterions from the surrounding solution and repel co-ions. In equilibrium, the surface charge is balanced by oppositely charged counterions in solution. The region near the surface of enhanced\ncounterion concentration is called the electrical double layer (EDL). The EDL can be approximated by a sub-division into two regions. Ions in the region closest to the charged wall surface are strongly bound to the surface. This immobile layer is called the Stern or Helmholtz layer. The region adjacent to the Stern layer is called the diffuse layer and contains loosely associated ions that are comparatively mobile. The total electrical double layer due to the formation of the counterion layers results in electrostatic screening of the wall charge and minimizes the [[Gibbs free energy]] of EDL formation.\n\nThe thickness of the diffuse electric double layer is known as the [[Debye screening length]] <math>1/\\kappa</math>. At a distance of two Debye screening lengths the electrical potential energy is reduced to 2 percent of the value at the surface wall.\n\n: <math>\\kappa = \\sqrt{\\sum_i \\frac{\\rho_{\\infty i} e^2z^2_i}{\\epsilon_r \\epsilon_0 k_{\\rm B} T}}</math>\n\nwith unit of ''m''<sup>&minus;1</sup>\nwhere\n*<math>\\rho_{\\infty i}</math> is the number density of ion i in the bulk solution.\n*''z'' is the valency of the ion.

Recording density was 128 characters per inch (198 micrometre/character) on eight tracks at a linear speed of {{convert|100|in/s|m/s|sigfig=3|abbr=on}}, yielding a data rate of 12,800 characters per second. Of the eight tracks, six were data, one was a [[parity bit|parity track]], and one was a clock, or timing track. Making allowances for the empty space between tape blocks, the actual transfer rate was around 7,200 characters per second. A small reel of mylar tape provided separation from the metal tape and the read/write head.<ref>{{cite journal \n   |url=https://www.computer.org/csdl/proceedings/afips/1952/5041/00/50410047.pdf \n   |title=The Uniservo - Tape Reader and Recorder \n   |author1=H.

Magnetic tape dimensions were {{convert|0.5|in|mm|sigfig=3|abbr=out|adj=on}} wide and wound on removable reels up to {{convert|10.5|in|mm|sigfig=3|abbr=out}} in diameter. Different tape lengths were available with {{convert|1200|ft|m|sigfig=2|abbr=out}} and {{convert|2400|ft|m|sigfig=2|abbr=out}} on mil and one half thickness being somewhat standard.{{clarify|date=September 2012}}<!-- 1.5 mil or 1.0 mil and 0.5 mil? --> During the 1980s, longer tape lengths such as {{convert|3600|ft|m|sigfig=2|abbr=out}} became available using a much thinner [[PET film (biaxially oriented)|PET film]]. Most tape drives could support a maximum reel size of {{convert|10.5|in|mm|sigfig=3|abbr=out}}. [[Control Data Corporation|CDC]] used IBM compatible 1/2 inch magnetic tapes, but also offered a 1 inch wide variant, with 14 tracks (12 data tracks corresponding to the 12 bit word of [[CDC 6000 series]] peripheral processors, plus two parity bits) in the CDC 626 drive.<ref>{{cite book |title=Control Data 6400/6600 Computing Systems' Configurator |date=October 1966 |publisher=Control Data Corporation |page=4}}</ref>\n\nA so-called ''mini-reel'' was common for smaller data sets, such as for software distribution. These were {{convert|7|in|cm|adj=on}} reels, often with no fixed length&mdash;the tape was sized to fit the amount of data recorded on it as a cost-saving measure.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nEarly IBM tape drives, such as the [[IBM 727]] and [[IBM 729]], were mechanically sophisticated floor-standing drives that used [[Vacuum column (tape drive)|vacuum columns]] to buffer long u-shaped loops of tape. Between servo control of powerful reel motors, a low-mass capstan drive, and the low-friction and controlled tension of the vacuum columns, fast start and stop of the tape at the tape-to-head interface could be achieved: 1.5&nbsp;ms from stopped tape to full speed of {{convert|112.5|in/s|m/s|sigfig=3|abbr=out}}.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}<!-- these numbers seem to be for a 0.3 inch IRG which is not consistent with \"early\" tape drives. Prolay idler/capstan motor issue, too. --> The fast acceleration is possible because the tape [[mass]] in the vacuum columns is small; the length of tape buffered in the columns provides time to spin the high [[inertia]] reels. When active, the two tape reels thus fed tape into or pulled tape out of the vacuum columns, intermittently spinning in rapid, unsynchronized bursts resulting in visually striking action. Stock shots of such vacuum-column tape drives in motion were widely used to represent \"the computer\" in movies and television.<ref>{{cite web\n   |title=11 super high tech computers seen on 1960s television\n   |url=https://www.metv.com/lists/11-super-high-tech-computers-seen-on-1960s-television}}</ref>\n\nEarly half-inch tape had seven parallel tracks of data along the length of the tape, allowing six-bit characters plus one bit of [[parity bit|parity]] written across the tape. This was known as [[IBM 7 track|seven-track tape]]. With the introduction of the [[IBM System/360]] mainframe, [[nine-track tape]]s were introduced to support the new 8-bit characters that it used.\n\nRecording density increased over time. Common seven-track densities started at 200 six-bit characters per inch (CPI), then 556, and finally 800. Nine-track tapes had densities of 800 (using [[NRZI]]), then 1600 (using [[Phase encoding|PE]]), and finally 6250 (using [[Group-coded recording|GCR]]). This translates into about 5 megabytes to 140 megabytes per standard length (2400{{nbsp}}ft) reel of tape. The end of a file was designated by a special recorded pattern called a [[tape mark]], and end of the recorded data on a tape by two successive tape marks. The physical beginning and end of usable tape was indicated by reflective adhesive strips of aluminum foil placed on the back side.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nEffective density also increased as the interblock gap ([[inter-record gap]]) decreased from a nominal 0.75-inch on seven-track tape reel to a nominal 0.30-inches on a 6250 bpi nine track tape reel.<ref>{{cite web\n |url=https://www.ibm.com/ibm/history/exhibits/storage/storage_3420.html \n |title=IBM 3420 magnetic tape drive  |publisher=IBM |access-date= June 2, 2019}}</ref>\n\nAt least partly due to the success of the S/360, and the resultant standardization on 8-bit character codes and byte addressing, nine-track tapes were very widely used throughout the computer industry during the 1970s and 1980s.<ref>{{cite web  |url=https://ricehistorycorner.com/2015/05/13/obsolete-technology-reel-to-reel/\n |title=Obsolete Technology: Reel to Reel  |date=May 15, 2015\n |website=Rice History Corner   |publisher=Rice University  |access-date=June 2, 2019 |quote=...became de rigueur on many different computers, from mainframes to minis. }}</ref>  IBM no longer introduced reel-to-reel products beginning with its 1984 introduction of the cartridge based [[IBM 3480 Family|3480 family]].\n\n===DEC format===\n[[LINCtape]], and its derivative, [[DECtape]], were variations on this \"round tape\". They were essentially a personal storage medium. The tape was {{convert|0.75|in|mm}} wide and featured a fixed formatting track which, unlike standard tape, made it feasible to read and rewrite blocks repeatedly in place. LINCtapes and DECtapes had similar capacity and data transfer rate to the [[diskette]]s that displaced them, but their \"seek times\" were on the order of thirty seconds to a minute.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n==Cartridges and cassettes==\n[[Image:Quarter-Inch Cartridges.jpg|thumb|right|Quarter-inch cartridges]]\nIn the context of magnetic tape, the term ''cassette'' or ''cartridge'' means a length of magnetic tape in a plastic enclosure with one or two reels for controlling the motion of the tape. The type of packaging is a large determinant of the load and unload times as well as the length of tape that can be held. In a single reel cartridge there is a takeup reel in the drive while a dual reel cartridge has both takeup and supply reels in the cartridge. A tape drive (or \"transport\" or \"deck\") uses one or more precisely controlled motors to wind the tape from one reel to the other, passing a read/write head as it does.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n[[File:3590Tape.JPG|right|thumb|An [[IBM 3590]] data cartridge can hold up to 10[[GiB]] uncompressed.]]\nA different type is the [[endless tape cartridge]], which has a continuous loop of tape wound on a special reel that allows tape to be withdrawn from the center of the reel and then wrapped up around the edge, and therefore does not need to rewind to repeat. This type is similar to a cassette in that there is no take-up reel inside the tape drive.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nThe [[IBM 7340]] Hypertape drive, introduced in 1961, used a dual reel cassette with a {{convert|1|in|cm}} wide tape capable of holding 2 million six-bit characters per cassette.\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, audio [[Compact Cassette#Data recording|Compact Cassette]]s were frequently used as an inexpensive data storage system for [[home computers]], or in some cases for diagnostics or boot code for larger systems such as the [[Burroughs B1700]]. Compact cassettes were logically, as well as physically, sequential; they had to be rewound and read from the start to load data. Early cartridges were available before personal computers had affordable disk drives, and could be used as [[random access]] devices, automatically winding and positioning the tape, albeit with access times of many seconds.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\nExperienced computer gamers could tell a lot by listening to the loading noise from the tape.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Stuart |first1=Keith |title=Click, whir, ping: the lost sounds of loading video games |url=https://www.theguardian.com/games/2019/aug/27/click-whir-ping-lost-sounds-of-loading-video-games |accessdate=14 October 2019 |work=The Guardian |date=27 Aug 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn 1984 IBM introduced the [[IBM 3480 Family|3480 family]] of single reel cartridges and tape drives which were then manufactured by a number of vendors thru at least 2004.  Initially providing 200 megabytes per cartridge the family capacity increased over time to 2.4 gigabytes per cartridge. [[Digital Linear Tape|DLT]] (Digital Linear Tape), also a cartridge based tape, was beginning 1984 but as of 2007 future development was stopped in favor of LTO.\n\nIn 2003 IBM introduced the [[IBM 3592|IBM 3592 family]] to supersede the [[IBM 3590]]. While the name is similar, there is no compatibility between the 3590 and the 3592. Like the 3590 and 3480 before it, this tape format has half inch tape spooled into a single reel cartridge. Initially introduced to support 300 gigabytes, the current sixth generation released in 2018 supports a native capacity of 20 terabytes. \n\n[[Linear Tape-Open|LTO]] (Linear Tape Open, also known as Ultrium) single reel cartridge was announced in 1997 at 100 megabytes and in its eighth generation supports 12 terabytes in the same sized cartridge.  {{As of|2019}} LTO has [[Linear Tape-Open#Market performance|completely displaced]] all other tape technologies in computer applications, with the exception of some [[IBM 3592]] family at the high-end.\n\n==Technical details==\n\n===Linear density===\nRecording density for computer tapes is described with the acronym BPI, sometimes written bpi.\n\n===={{Visible anchor|Bytes Per Inch}}====\n'''Bytes Per Inch''' is the metric for the density at which data is stored on magnetic media. The term BPI can refer to bits per inch,<ref>\"bit density\"{{cite web\n   |url=http://thelawdictionary.org/bits-per-inch-bpi \n   |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170926142942/http://thelawdictionary.org/bits-per-inch-bpi\n   |archivedate=2017-09-26 \n   |title=Black's Law Dictionary, 2nd Ed}}</ref> but more often refers to [[Byte]]s per inch.<ref>{{cite book\n   |url=https://archive.org/details/economicsofcompu00shar   |url-access=registration   |isbn=0231083106\n   |title=The Economics of Computers  |page=[https://archive.org/details/economicsofcompu00shar/page/426 426]\n   |author=William F.

Sharpe |date=1969}}</ref>\n \n===Tape width===\nThe width of the media is the primary classification criterion for tape technologies. Half-inch has historically been the most common width of tape for high-capacity data storage.<ref>[http://downloads.quantum.com/sdlt320/handbook.pdf SDLT 320 handbook]</ref> Many other sizes exist and most were developed to either have smaller packaging or higher capacity.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n===Recording method===\n[[Image:Linear tape drive.png|thumb|Linear]]\nRecording method is also an important way to classify tape technologies, generally falling into two categories:{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n====Linear====\n[[Image:Linear serpentine tape drive.png|thumb|Linear serpentine]]\nThe '''linear''' method arranges data in long parallel tracks that span the length of the tape. Multiple tape heads simultaneously write parallel tape tracks on a single medium. This method was used in early tape drives. It is the simplest recording method, but also has the lowest data density.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nA variation on linear technology is '''linear serpentine''' recording, which uses more tracks than tape heads. Each head still writes one track at a time. After making a pass over the whole length of the tape, all heads shift slightly and make another pass in the reverse direction, writing another set of tracks. This procedure is repeated until all tracks have been read or written. By using the linear serpentine method, the tape medium can have many more tracks than read/write heads. Compared to simple linear recording, using the same tape length and the same number of heads, data storage capacity is substantially higher.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n====Scanning====\n[[Image:Helical tape drive.png|thumb|Helical]]\nScanning recording methods write short dense tracks across the width of the tape medium, not along the length. Tape heads are placed on a drum or disk which rapidly rotates while the relatively slow-moving tape passes it.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nAn early method used to get a higher data rate than the prevailing linear method was '''transverse scan'''. In this method, a spinning disk with the tape heads embedded in the outer edge is placed perpendicular to the path of the tape. This method is used in [[Ampex]]'s DCRsi instrumentation data recorders and the old [[Ampex]] [[quadruplex videotape]] system. Another early method was '''arcuate scan'''. In this method, the heads are on the face of a spinning disk which is laid flat against the tape. The path of the tape heads forms an arc.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n'''[[Helical scan]]''' recording writes short dense tracks in a ''diagonal'' manner. This method is used by virtually all current [[videotape]] systems and several data tape formats.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n===Block layout and speed matching===\nIn a typical format, data is written to tape in blocks with inter-block gaps between them, and each block is written in a single operation with the tape running continuously during the write. However, since the rate at which data is written or read to the tape drive is not deterministic, a tape drive usually has to cope with a difference between the rate at which data goes on and off the tape and the rate at which data is supplied or demanded by its host.\n\nVarious methods have been used alone and in combination to cope with this difference. If the host cannot keep up with the tape drive transfer rate, the tape drive can be stopped, backed up, and restarted (known as [[Tape drive#Problems|shoe-shining]], with the restart optionally occurring at a lower speed). A large memory buffer can be used to queue the data. In the past, the host block size affected the data density on tape, but on modern drives, data is typically organized into fixed sized blocks which may or may not be compressed and/or encrypted, and host block size no longer affects data density on tape. The [[Linear Tape-Open]] article covers this. Modern tape drives offer a speed matching feature, where the drive can dynamically decrease the physical tape speed as needed to avoid shoe-shining.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=tss1wp102594&aid=1 |title=Info |publisher=www-01.ibm.com |date= |accessdate=2019-12-28}}</ref>\n\nIn the past, the size of the inter-block gap was constant, while the size of the data block was based on host block size, affecting tape capacity \u2013 for example, on [[count key data]] storage. On most modern drives, this is no longer true. [[Linear Tape-Open]] type drives use a fixed-size block for tape (a [[fixed-block architecture]]), independent of the host block size, and the inter-block gap is variable to assist with speed matching during writes. On drives with compression, the compressibility of the data will affect the capacity.\n\n===Sequential access to data===\nTape is characterized by [[sequential access]] to data. While tape can provide fast sequential data transfers, it takes tens of seconds to load a cassette and position the tape head to an arbitrary place. By contrast, hard disk technology can perform the equivalent action in tens of milliseconds (3 orders of magnitude faster) and can be thought of as offering [[random access]] to data.\n\nLogical filesystems require data and metadata to be stored on the data storage medium. Storing metadata in one place and data in another requires lots of slow repositioning activity on most tape systems. As a result, most tape systems use a trivial filesystem in which files are addressed by number, not by filename. [[Metadata]] such as file name or modification time is typically not stored at all. [[Tape label]]s store such metadata, and they are used for interchanging data between systems. [[File archiver]] and [[backup]] tools have been created to pack multiple files along with the related metadata into a single 'tape file'. Serpentine tape drives (e.g., [[Quarter-inch cartridge|QIC]]) can improve access time by switching to the appropriate track; tape partitions were used for directory information.<ref>Wangtek Corporation, OEM Manual, Series 5099ES/5125ES/5150ES SCSI Interface Streaming 1/4 Inch Tape Cartridge Drive, Rev D, 1991. QFA (Quick File Access) Partition, page 4-29\u20134-31.</ref> The [[Linear Tape File System]] is a method of storing file metadata on a separate part of the tape. This makes it possible to [[copy and paste]] files or directories to a tape as if it were just like another disk, but does not change the fundamental sequential access nature of tape.\n\n===Access time===\nTape has quite a long latency for random accesses since the deck must wind an average of one-third the tape length to move from one arbitrary data block to another. Most tape systems attempt to alleviate the intrinsic long latency, either using indexing, where a separate lookup table (''tape directory'') is maintained which gives the physical tape location for a given data block number (a must for serpentine drives), or by marking blocks with a [[tape mark]] that can be detected while winding the tape at high speed.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n===Data compression===\nMost tape drives now include some kind of [[lossless data compression]]. There are several algorithms which provide similar results: LZ (most), IDRC (Exabyte), ALDC (IBM, QIC) and DLZ1 (DLT). Embedded in tape drive hardware, these compress a relatively small buffer of data at a time, so cannot achieve extremely high compression even of highly redundant data. A ratio of 2:1 is typical, with some vendors claiming 2.6:1 or 3:1. The ratio actually obtained with real data is often less than the stated figure; the compression ratio cannot be relied upon when specifying the capacity of equipment, e.g., a drive claiming a compressed capacity of 500GB may not be adequate to back up 500GB of real data. Data that is already stored efficiently may not allow ''any'' significant compression; a sparse database may offer much larger factors. Software compression can achieve much better results with sparse data, but uses the host computer's processor, and can slow the backup if it is unable to compress as fast as the data is written.\n\nThe compression algorithms used in low-end products are not the most effective known today, and better results can usually be obtained by turning off hardware compression AND using software compression (and encryption if desired) instead.\n\nPlain text, raw images, and database files ([[Text file|TXT]], [[ASCII]], [[BMP file format|BMP]], [[dBASE|DBF]], etc.) typically compress much better than other types of data stored on computer systems. By contrast, encrypted data and pre-compressed data ([[Pretty Good Privacy|PGP]], [[ZIP (file format)|ZIP]], [[JPEG]], [[MPEG]], [[MP3]], etc.) would normally ''increase'' in size,<ref>As illustrated by the [[pigeonhole principle]], every lossless data compression algorithm will end up increasing the size of ''some'' inputs.</ref> if data compression was applied. In some cases this data expansion could be as much as 15%.\n\n===Encryption===\nStandards exist to [[encryption|encrypt]] tapes.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tape Encryption Purchase Considerations|website=[[Computer Weekly]]|url=http://www.computerweekly.com/feature/Tape-encryption-purchase-considerations|date=Oct 2007|accessdate=11 May 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518093552/http://www.computerweekly.com/feature/Tape-encryption-purchase-considerations|archivedate=18 May 2015}}</ref> Encryption is used so that even if a tape is stolen, the thieves cannot use the data on the tape. Key management is crucial to maintain security. Encryption is more efficient if done after compression, as encrypted data cannot be compressed effectively. Some enterprise tape drives can quickly encrypt data. Symmetric streaming encryption algorithms{{Which|date=March 2020}} can also provide high performance{{Citation Needed|date=March 2020}}.\n\n===Cartridge memory and self-identification===\nSome tape cartridges, notably [[Linear Tape-Open#Cartridge memory|LTO cartridges]], have small associated data storage chips built into the cartridges to record metadata about the tape, such as the type of encoding, the size of the storage, dates and other information. It is also common{{Citation Needed|date=March 2020}} for tape cartridges to have bar codes on their labels in order to assist an automated tape library.\n\n==Viability==\nAs of 2009, medium- and large-sized data centers deployed both tape- and disk-based storage.<ref>{{cite web |author=02/17/2009 |url=http://esj.com/articles/2009/02/17/in-the-tape-vs-disk-war-think-tape-and-disk.aspx |title=In the Tape vs. Disk War, Think Tape AND Disk - Enterprise Systems |publisher=Esj.com |date=2009-02-17 |accessdate=2012-01-31 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120201160318/http://esj.com/articles/2009/02/17/in-the-tape-vs-disk-war-think-tape-and-disk.aspx |archivedate=2012-02-01 }}</ref>\n\nThe costs of disk storage have decreased faster than that of tapes. Until about the end of the twentieth century, prices and capacities allowed backing up a desktop hard drive to tape more cheaply and more compactly than backing up to an additional external or removable drive. Drive prices offer capacities of hundreds to thousands of megabytes on relatively inexpensive machines. Backing up to an external USB drive became cheaper, and the drive more compact, than tape for a non-networked machine used by a business or serious user.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://h71036.www7.hp.com/hho/cache/565958-0-0-225-121.html |title=HP article on backup for home users, recommending several methods, but not tape, 2011 |publisher=H71036.www7.hp.com |date=2010-03-25 |accessdate=2012-01-31 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111209125241/http://h71036.www7.hp.com/hho/cache/565958-0-0-225-121.html |archivedate=2011-12-09 }}</ref>\n\nAs a basic comparison, [[Mainframe computer|mainframe]]-class tape drives, such as Oracle's Sun StorageTek T10000B, are priced{{When|date=November 2011}} at approximately [[US$]]37,000 each, excluding tape libraries. (IBM's TS1130 is also representative of this storage class.) Each T10000C tape drive can read or write (or simultaneously read and write{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}} ) to one cartridge containing up to 5TB of uncompressed data. Real-world sequential data transfer speeds are high (sustained 240MB/second for the T10000C and 160MB/second for the TS1130) compared to disk. However, PC-class hard disks are priced below $200 for 3TB.<ref>Mainframe-class tape vendors specify terabytes of capacity, while hard disk vendors typically specify trillions of bytes of capacity{{Citation Needed|date=March 2020}}. Two trillion bytes is approximately 1.8 terabytes.</ref> One mainframe-class hard disk still has a much lower price than one mainframe-class tape drive, so the economics might favor disk{{Citation Needed|date=March 2020}}.\n\nHowever, the key difference is that tape drives can exchange their magnetic media (the cartridges) frequently, while the magnetic media installed inside each hard disk is fixed and cannot be swapped{{Citation Needed|date=March 2020}}. (The drives themselves could be moved if installed in swappable caddies at extra cost, with extra cost hot-swappable infrastructure.) Mainframe-class tape drives are almost always installed in robotic [[tape libraries]]{{Citation Needed|date=March 2020}} which are often quite large and can hold thousands of cartridges. The StorageTek SL8500 library is one representative example{{Citation Needed|date=March 2020}}. The ''smallest'' SL8500 library holds up to 1,448 tape cartridges, for 1.4 Petabytes of online uncompressed storage. An equivalent amount of PC-class hard disk storage would be priced at $100,000 or less for the drives. The tape library would likely deliver{{Citation Needed|date=March 2020}} a higher sustained sequential write speed, the media would be more rugged {{Citation Needed|date=March 2020}} (for off-site storage), the media would meet or exceed long-term archival storage requirements{{Citation Needed|date=March 2020}} (for reliable retrieval decades into the future{{Citation Needed|date=March 2020}}), and the data center power and cooling requirements would be considerably lower.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} The economics of this comparison are more complicated than a single-spindle versus tape drive comparison{{Citation Needed|date=March 2020}}.\n\nWhether tape's characteristics versus disk are useful or not will depend on the particular data center and its data storage requirements.

In the early twenty-first century [[solid state storage]] encroached on disk's previous near-monopoly in random access non-volatile data storage, while disk pushed into tape's territory to some extent, particularly in situations where sequential data access is only a relatively small part of a particular data center's storage requirements.\n\n==High-density magnetic media==\n[[Sony]] announced, in 2014, that they had developed, using a new vacuum thin-film forming technology able to form extremely fine crystal particles, a tape storage technology with the highest reported magnetic tape data density, 148&nbsp;Gbit/in\u00b2 (23&nbsp;Gbit/cm\u00b2), potentially allowing a native tape capacity of 185&nbsp;TB.<ref name=breakthrough2014>{{cite web|title=Sony develops magnetic tape technology with the world's highest*1 areal recording density of 148 Gb/in2|url=http://www.sony.net/SonyInfo/News/Press/201404/14-044E/index.html|publisher=Sony|accessdate=5 May 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140505022337/http://www.sony.net/SonyInfo/News/Press/201404/14-044E/index.html|archivedate=5 May 2014}}</ref> It was further developed by [[Sony]], with announcement in 2017, about reported data density of 201&nbsp;Gbit/in\u00b2 (31&nbsp;Gbit/cm\u00b2), giving standard compressed tape capacity of 330&nbsp;TB.<ref name=breakthrough2017>{{cite web|title=Sony Develops Magnetic Tape Storage Technology with the Industry's Highest*1 Recording Areal Density of 201 Gb/in2|url=https://www.sony.net/SonyInfo/News/Press/201708/17-070E/index.html|publisher=Sony|accessdate=2018-02-18}}</ref>\n\nIn May 2014, [[Fujifilm]] followed Sony and made an announcement that it will develop a 154&nbsp;TB tape cartridge in conjunction with [[IBM]], which will have an [[Areal density (computer storage)|areal data storage density]] of 85.9 GBit/in\u00b2 (13.3 billion bits per cm\u00b2) on linear magnetic particulate tape.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fujifilm.com/news/n140521.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-06-07 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170616130841/http://www.fujifilm.com/news/n140521.html |archivedate=2017-06-16 }}</ref> The technology developed by Fujifilm, called NANOCUBIC, reduces the particulate volume of BaFe magnetic tape, simultaneously increasing the smoothness of the tape, increasing the signal to noise ratio during read and write while enabling high frequency response.\n\n==Chronological list of tape formats==\n{{see also|Tape drive#History}}\n\n[[Image:Ibm-729v.jpg|thumb|IBM 729V]]\n\n{| style=\"width:65%;\"\n|- valign=top\n| style=\"width:50%;\"|\n* 1951 -

The [[UNISERVO]] drive recording medium was a thin metal strip of {{convert|0.5|in|mm|sigfig=3|abbr=out|adj=on}} wide [[nickel]]-plated [[phosphor bronze]]. Recording density was 128 characters per inch (198 micrometre/character) on eight tracks at a linear speed of {{convert|100|in/s|m/s|sigfig=3|abbr=on}}, yielding a data rate of 12,800 characters per second. Of the eight tracks, six were data, one was a [[parity bit|parity track]], and one was a clock, or timing track. Making allowances for the empty space between tape blocks, the actual transfer rate was around 7,200 characters per second. A small reel of mylar tape provided separation from the metal tape and the read/write head.<ref>{{cite journal \n   |url=https://www.computer.org/csdl/proceedings/afips/1952/5041/00/50410047.pdf \n   |title=The Uniservo - Tape Reader and Recorder \n   |author1=H.

IBM's technology soon became the de facto industry standard. Magnetic tape dimensions were {{convert|0.5|in|mm|sigfig=3|abbr=out|adj=on}} wide and wound on removable reels up to {{convert|10.5|in|mm|sigfig=3|abbr=out}} in diameter. Different tape lengths were available with {{convert|1200|ft|m|sigfig=2|abbr=out}} and {{convert|2400|ft|m|sigfig=2|abbr=out}} on mil and one half thickness being somewhat standard.{{clarify|date=September 2012}}<!-- 1.5 mil or 1.0 mil and 0.5 mil? --> During the 1980s, longer tape lengths such as {{convert|3600|ft|m|sigfig=2|abbr=out}} became available using a much thinner [[PET film (biaxially oriented)|PET film]]. Most tape drives could support a maximum reel size of {{convert|10.5|in|mm|sigfig=3|abbr=out}}. [[Control Data Corporation|CDC]] used IBM compatible 1/2 inch magnetic tapes, but also offered a 1 inch wide variant, with 14 tracks (12 data tracks corresponding to the 12 bit word of [[CDC 6000 series]] peripheral processors, plus two parity bits) in the CDC 626 drive.<ref>{{cite book |title=Control Data 6400/6600 Computing Systems' Configurator |date=October 1966 |publisher=Control Data Corporation |page=4}}</ref>\n\nA so-called ''mini-reel'' was common for smaller data sets, such as for software distribution. These were {{convert|7|in|cm|adj=on}} reels, often with no fixed length&mdash;the tape was sized to fit the amount of data recorded on it as a cost-saving measure.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nEarly IBM tape drives, such as the [[IBM 727]] and [[IBM 729]], were mechanically sophisticated floor-standing drives that used [[Vacuum column (tape drive)|vacuum columns]] to buffer long u-shaped loops of tape. Between servo control of powerful reel motors, a low-mass capstan drive, and the low-friction and controlled tension of the vacuum columns, fast start and stop of the tape at the tape-to-head interface could be achieved: 1.5&nbsp;ms from stopped tape to full speed of {{convert|112.5|in/s|m/s|sigfig=3|abbr=out}}.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}<!-- these numbers seem to be for a 0.3 inch IRG which is not consistent with \"early\" tape drives. Prolay idler/capstan motor issue, too. --> The fast acceleration is possible because the tape [[mass]] in the vacuum columns is small; the length of tape buffered in the columns provides time to spin the high [[inertia]] reels. When active, the two tape reels thus fed tape into or pulled tape out of the vacuum columns, intermittently spinning in rapid, unsynchronized bursts resulting in visually striking action. Stock shots of such vacuum-column tape drives in motion were widely used to represent \"the computer\" in movies and television.<ref>{{cite web\n   |title=11 super high tech computers seen on 1960s television\n   |url=https://www.metv.com/lists/11-super-high-tech-computers-seen-on-1960s-television}}</ref>\n\nEarly half-inch tape had seven parallel tracks of data along the length of the tape, allowing six-bit characters plus one bit of [[parity bit|parity]] written across the tape. This was known as [[IBM 7 track|seven-track tape]]. With the introduction of the [[IBM System/360]] mainframe, [[nine-track tape]]s were introduced to support the new 8-bit characters that it used.\n\nRecording density increased over time. Common seven-track densities started at 200 six-bit characters per inch (CPI), then 556, and finally 800. Nine-track tapes had densities of 800 (using [[NRZI]]), then 1600 (using [[Phase encoding|PE]]), and finally 6250 (using [[Group-coded recording|GCR]]). This translates into about 5 megabytes to 140 megabytes per standard length (2400{{nbsp}}ft) reel of tape. The end of a file was designated by a special recorded pattern called a [[tape mark]], and end of the recorded data on a tape by two successive tape marks. The physical beginning and end of usable tape was indicated by reflective adhesive strips of aluminum foil placed on the back side.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nEffective density also increased as the interblock gap ([[inter-record gap]]) decreased from a nominal 0.75-inch on seven-track tape reel to a nominal 0.30-inches on a 6250 bpi nine track tape reel.<ref>{{cite web\n |url=https://www.ibm.com/ibm/history/exhibits/storage/storage_3420.html \n |title=IBM 3420 magnetic tape drive  |publisher=IBM |access-date= June 2, 2019}}</ref>\n\nAt least partly due to the success of the S/360, and the resultant standardization on 8-bit character codes and byte addressing, nine-track tapes were very widely used throughout the computer industry during the 1970s and 1980s.<ref>{{cite web  |url=https://ricehistorycorner.com/2015/05/13/obsolete-technology-reel-to-reel/\n |title=Obsolete Technology: Reel to Reel  |date=May 15, 2015\n |website=Rice History Corner   |publisher=Rice University  |access-date=June 2, 2019 |quote=...became de rigueur on many different computers, from mainframes to minis. }}</ref>  IBM no longer introduced reel-to-reel products beginning with its 1984 introduction of the cartridge based [[IBM 3480 Family|3480 family]].\n\n===DEC format===\n[[LINCtape]], and its derivative, [[DECtape]], were variations on this \"round tape\". They were essentially a personal storage medium. The tape was {{convert|0.75|in|mm}} wide and featured a fixed formatting track which, unlike standard tape, made it feasible to read and rewrite blocks repeatedly in place. LINCtapes and DECtapes had similar capacity and data transfer rate to the [[diskette]]s that displaced them, but their \"seek times\" were on the order of thirty seconds to a minute.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n==Cartridges and cassettes==\n[[Image:Quarter-Inch Cartridges.jpg|thumb|right|Quarter-inch cartridges]]\nIn the context of magnetic tape, the term ''cassette'' or ''cartridge'' means a length of magnetic tape in a plastic enclosure with one or two reels for controlling the motion of the tape. The type of packaging is a large determinant of the load and unload times as well as the length of tape that can be held. In a single reel cartridge there is a takeup reel in the drive while a dual reel cartridge has both takeup and supply reels in the cartridge. A tape drive (or \"transport\" or \"deck\") uses one or more precisely controlled motors to wind the tape from one reel to the other, passing a read/write head as it does.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n[[File:3590Tape.JPG|right|thumb|An [[IBM 3590]] data cartridge can hold up to 10[[GiB]] uncompressed.]]\nA different type is the [[endless tape cartridge]], which has a continuous loop of tape wound on a special reel that allows tape to be withdrawn from the center of the reel and then wrapped up around the edge, and therefore does not need to rewind to repeat. This type is similar to a cassette in that there is no take-up reel inside the tape drive.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nThe [[IBM 7340]] Hypertape drive, introduced in 1961, used a dual reel cassette with a {{convert|1|in|cm}} wide tape capable of holding 2 million six-bit characters per cassette.\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, audio [[Compact Cassette#Data recording|Compact Cassette]]s were frequently used as an inexpensive data storage system for [[home computers]], or in some cases for diagnostics or boot code for larger systems such as the [[Burroughs B1700]]. Compact cassettes were logically, as well as physically, sequential; they had to be rewound and read from the start to load data. Early cartridges were available before personal computers had affordable disk drives, and could be used as [[random access]] devices, automatically winding and positioning the tape, albeit with access times of many seconds.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\nExperienced computer gamers could tell a lot by listening to the loading noise from the tape.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Stuart |first1=Keith |title=Click, whir, ping: the lost sounds of loading video games |url=https://www.theguardian.com/games/2019/aug/27/click-whir-ping-lost-sounds-of-loading-video-games |accessdate=14 October 2019 |work=The Guardian |date=27 Aug 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn 1984 IBM introduced the [[IBM 3480 Family|3480 family]] of single reel cartridges and tape drives which were then manufactured by a number of vendors thru at least 2004.  Initially providing 200 megabytes per cartridge the family capacity increased over time to 2.4 gigabytes per cartridge. [[Digital Linear Tape|DLT]] (Digital Linear Tape), also a cartridge based tape, was beginning 1984 but as of 2007 future development was stopped in favor of LTO.\n\nIn 2003 IBM introduced the [[IBM 3592|IBM 3592 family]] to supersede the [[IBM 3590]]. While the name is similar, there is no compatibility between the 3590 and the 3592. Like the 3590 and 3480 before it, this tape format has half inch tape spooled into a single reel cartridge. Initially introduced to support 300 gigabytes, the current sixth generation released in 2018 supports a native capacity of 20 terabytes. \n\n[[Linear Tape-Open|LTO]] (Linear Tape Open, also known as Ultrium) single reel cartridge was announced in 1997 at 100 megabytes and in its eighth generation supports 12 terabytes in the same sized cartridge.  {{As of|2019}} LTO has [[Linear Tape-Open#Market performance|completely displaced]] all other tape technologies in computer applications, with the exception of some [[IBM 3592]] family at the high-end.\n\n==Technical details==\n\n===Linear density===\nRecording density for computer tapes is described with the acronym BPI, sometimes written bpi.\n\n===={{Visible anchor|Bytes Per Inch}}====\n'''Bytes Per Inch''' is the metric for the density at which data is stored on magnetic media.

Sharpe |date=1969}}</ref>\n \n===Tape width===\nThe width of the media is the primary classification criterion for tape technologies. Half-inch has historically been the most common width of tape for high-capacity data storage.<ref>[http://downloads.quantum.com/sdlt320/handbook.pdf SDLT 320 handbook]</ref> Many other sizes exist and most were developed to either have smaller packaging or higher capacity.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n===Recording method===\n[[Image:Linear tape drive.png|thumb|Linear]]\nRecording method is also an important way to classify tape technologies, generally falling into two categories:{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n====Linear====\n[[Image:Linear serpentine tape drive.png|thumb|Linear serpentine]]\nThe '''linear''' method arranges data in long parallel tracks that span the length of the tape. Multiple tape heads simultaneously write parallel tape tracks on a single medium. This method was used in early tape drives. It is the simplest recording method, but also has the lowest data density.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nA variation on linear technology is '''linear serpentine''' recording, which uses more tracks than tape heads. Each head still writes one track at a time. After making a pass over the whole length of the tape, all heads shift slightly and make another pass in the reverse direction, writing another set of tracks. This procedure is repeated until all tracks have been read or written. By using the linear serpentine method, the tape medium can have many more tracks than read/write heads. Compared to simple linear recording, using the same tape length and the same number of heads, data storage capacity is substantially higher.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n====Scanning====\n[[Image:Helical tape drive.png|thumb|Helical]]\nScanning recording methods write short dense tracks across the width of the tape medium, not along the length. Tape heads are placed on a drum or disk which rapidly rotates while the relatively slow-moving tape passes it.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nAn early method used to get a higher data rate than the prevailing linear method was '''transverse scan'''. In this method, a spinning disk with the tape heads embedded in the outer edge is placed perpendicular to the path of the tape. This method is used in [[Ampex]]'s DCRsi instrumentation data recorders and the old [[Ampex]] [[quadruplex videotape]] system. Another early method was '''arcuate scan'''. In this method, the heads are on the face of a spinning disk which is laid flat against the tape. The path of the tape heads forms an arc.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n'''[[Helical scan]]''' recording writes short dense tracks in a ''diagonal'' manner. This method is used by virtually all current [[videotape]] systems and several data tape formats.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n===Block layout and speed matching===\nIn a typical format, data is written to tape in blocks with inter-block gaps between them, and each block is written in a single operation with the tape running continuously during the write. However, since the rate at which data is written or read to the tape drive is not deterministic, a tape drive usually has to cope with a difference between the rate at which data goes on and off the tape and the rate at which data is supplied or demanded by its host.\n\nVarious methods have been used alone and in combination to cope with this difference. If the host cannot keep up with the tape drive transfer rate, the tape drive can be stopped, backed up, and restarted (known as [[Tape drive#Problems|shoe-shining]], with the restart optionally occurring at a lower speed). A large memory buffer can be used to queue the data. In the past, the host block size affected the data density on tape, but on modern drives, data is typically organized into fixed sized blocks which may or may not be compressed and/or encrypted, and host block size no longer affects data density on tape. The [[Linear Tape-Open]] article covers this. Modern tape drives offer a speed matching feature, where the drive can dynamically decrease the physical tape speed as needed to avoid shoe-shining.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=tss1wp102594&aid=1 |title=Info |publisher=www-01.ibm.com |date= |accessdate=2019-12-28}}</ref>\n\nIn the past, the size of the inter-block gap was constant, while the size of the data block was based on host block size, affecting tape capacity \u2013 for example, on [[count key data]] storage. On most modern drives, this is no longer true. [[Linear Tape-Open]] type drives use a fixed-size block for tape (a [[fixed-block architecture]]), independent of the host block size, and the inter-block gap is variable to assist with speed matching during writes. On drives with compression, the compressibility of the data will affect the capacity.\n\n===Sequential access to data===\nTape is characterized by [[sequential access]] to data. While tape can provide fast sequential data transfers, it takes tens of seconds to load a cassette and position the tape head to an arbitrary place. By contrast, hard disk technology can perform the equivalent action in tens of milliseconds (3 orders of magnitude faster) and can be thought of as offering [[random access]] to data.\n\nLogical filesystems require data and metadata to be stored on the data storage medium. Storing metadata in one place and data in another requires lots of slow repositioning activity on most tape systems. As a result, most tape systems use a trivial filesystem in which files are addressed by number, not by filename. [[Metadata]] such as file name or modification time is typically not stored at all. [[Tape label]]s store such metadata, and they are used for interchanging data between systems. [[File archiver]] and [[backup]] tools have been created to pack multiple files along with the related metadata into a single 'tape file'. Serpentine tape drives (e.g., [[Quarter-inch cartridge|QIC]]) can improve access time by switching to the appropriate track; tape partitions were used for directory information.<ref>Wangtek Corporation, OEM Manual, Series 5099ES/5125ES/5150ES SCSI Interface Streaming 1/4 Inch Tape Cartridge Drive, Rev D, 1991. QFA (Quick File Access) Partition, page 4-29\u20134-31.</ref> The [[Linear Tape File System]] is a method of storing file metadata on a separate part of the tape. This makes it possible to [[copy and paste]] files or directories to a tape as if it were just like another disk, but does not change the fundamental sequential access nature of tape.\n\n===Access time===\nTape has quite a long latency for random accesses since the deck must wind an average of one-third the tape length to move from one arbitrary data block to another. Most tape systems attempt to alleviate the intrinsic long latency, either using indexing, where a separate lookup table (''tape directory'') is maintained which gives the physical tape location for a given data block number (a must for serpentine drives), or by marking blocks with a [[tape mark]] that can be detected while winding the tape at high speed.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n===Data compression===\nMost tape drives now include some kind of [[lossless data compression]]. There are several algorithms which provide similar results: LZ (most), IDRC (Exabyte), ALDC (IBM, QIC) and DLZ1 (DLT). Embedded in tape drive hardware, these compress a relatively small buffer of data at a time, so cannot achieve extremely high compression even of highly redundant data. A ratio of 2:1 is typical, with some vendors claiming 2.6:1 or 3:1. The ratio actually obtained with real data is often less than the stated figure; the compression ratio cannot be relied upon when specifying the capacity of equipment, e.g., a drive claiming a compressed capacity of 500GB may not be adequate to back up 500GB of real data. Data that is already stored efficiently may not allow ''any'' significant compression; a sparse database may offer much larger factors. Software compression can achieve much better results with sparse data, but uses the host computer's processor, and can slow the backup if it is unable to compress as fast as the data is written.\n\nThe compression algorithms used in low-end products are not the most effective known today, and better results can usually be obtained by turning off hardware compression AND using software compression (and encryption if desired) instead.\n\nPlain text, raw images, and database files ([[Text file|TXT]], [[ASCII]], [[BMP file format|BMP]], [[dBASE|DBF]], etc.) typically compress much better than other types of data stored on computer systems. By contrast, encrypted data and pre-compressed data ([[Pretty Good Privacy|PGP]], [[ZIP (file format)|ZIP]], [[JPEG]], [[MPEG]], [[MP3]], etc.) would normally ''increase'' in size,<ref>As illustrated by the [[pigeonhole principle]], every lossless data compression algorithm will end up increasing the size of ''some'' inputs.</ref> if data compression was applied. In some cases this data expansion could be as much as 15%.\n\n===Encryption===\nStandards exist to [[encryption|encrypt]] tapes.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tape Encryption Purchase Considerations|website=[[Computer Weekly]]|url=http://www.computerweekly.com/feature/Tape-encryption-purchase-considerations|date=Oct 2007|accessdate=11 May 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518093552/http://www.computerweekly.com/feature/Tape-encryption-purchase-considerations|archivedate=18 May 2015}}</ref> Encryption is used so that even if a tape is stolen, the thieves cannot use the data on the tape. Key management is crucial to maintain security. Encryption is more efficient if done after compression, as encrypted data cannot be compressed effectively. Some enterprise tape drives can quickly encrypt data. Symmetric streaming encryption algorithms{{Which|date=March 2020}} can also provide high performance{{Citation Needed|date=March 2020}}.\n\n===Cartridge memory and self-identification===\nSome tape cartridges, notably [[Linear Tape-Open#Cartridge memory|LTO cartridges]], have small associated data storage chips built into the cartridges to record metadata about the tape, such as the type of encoding, the size of the storage, dates and other information. It is also common{{Citation Needed|date=March 2020}} for tape cartridges to have bar codes on their labels in order to assist an automated tape library.\n\n==Viability==\nAs of 2009, medium- and large-sized data centers deployed both tape- and disk-based storage.<ref>{{cite web |author=02/17/2009 |url=http://esj.com/articles/2009/02/17/in-the-tape-vs-disk-war-think-tape-and-disk.aspx |title=In the Tape vs. Disk War, Think Tape AND Disk - Enterprise Systems |publisher=Esj.com |date=2009-02-17 |accessdate=2012-01-31 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120201160318/http://esj.com/articles/2009/02/17/in-the-tape-vs-disk-war-think-tape-and-disk.aspx |archivedate=2012-02-01 }}</ref>\n\nThe costs of disk storage have decreased faster than that of tapes. Until about the end of the twentieth century, prices and capacities allowed backing up a desktop hard drive to tape more cheaply and more compactly than backing up to an additional external or removable drive. Drive prices offer capacities of hundreds to thousands of megabytes on relatively inexpensive machines. Backing up to an external USB drive became cheaper, and the drive more compact, than tape for a non-networked machine used by a business or serious user.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://h71036.www7.hp.com/hho/cache/565958-0-0-225-121.html |title=HP article on backup for home users, recommending several methods, but not tape, 2011 |publisher=H71036.www7.hp.com |date=2010-03-25 |accessdate=2012-01-31 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111209125241/http://h71036.www7.hp.com/hho/cache/565958-0-0-225-121.html |archivedate=2011-12-09 }}</ref>\n\nAs a basic comparison, [[Mainframe computer|mainframe]]-class tape drives, such as Oracle's Sun StorageTek T10000B, are priced{{When|date=November 2011}} at approximately [[US$]]37,000 each, excluding tape libraries. (IBM's TS1130 is also representative of this storage class.) Each T10000C tape drive can read or write (or simultaneously read and write{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}} ) to one cartridge containing up to 5TB of uncompressed data. Real-world sequential data transfer speeds are high (sustained 240MB/second for the T10000C and 160MB/second for the TS1130) compared to disk. However, PC-class hard disks are priced below $200 for 3TB.<ref>Mainframe-class tape vendors specify terabytes of capacity, while hard disk vendors typically specify trillions of bytes of capacity{{Citation Needed|date=March 2020}}. Two trillion bytes is approximately 1.8 terabytes.</ref> One mainframe-class hard disk still has a much lower price than one mainframe-class tape drive, so the economics might favor disk{{Citation Needed|date=March 2020}}.\n\nHowever, the key difference is that tape drives can exchange their magnetic media (the cartridges) frequently, while the magnetic media installed inside each hard disk is fixed and cannot be swapped{{Citation Needed|date=March 2020}}. (The drives themselves could be moved if installed in swappable caddies at extra cost, with extra cost hot-swappable infrastructure.) Mainframe-class tape drives are almost always installed in robotic [[tape libraries]]{{Citation Needed|date=March 2020}} which are often quite large and can hold thousands of cartridges. The StorageTek SL8500 library is one representative example{{Citation Needed|date=March 2020}}. The ''smallest'' SL8500 library holds up to 1,448 tape cartridges, for 1.4 Petabytes of online uncompressed storage. An equivalent amount of PC-class hard disk storage would be priced at $100,000 or less for the drives. The tape library would likely deliver{{Citation Needed|date=March 2020}} a higher sustained sequential write speed, the media would be more rugged {{Citation Needed|date=March 2020}} (for off-site storage), the media would meet or exceed long-term archival storage requirements{{Citation Needed|date=March 2020}} (for reliable retrieval decades into the future{{Citation Needed|date=March 2020}}), and the data center power and cooling requirements would be considerably lower.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} The economics of this comparison are more complicated than a single-spindle versus tape drive comparison{{Citation Needed|date=March 2020}}.\n\nWhether tape's characteristics versus disk are useful or not will depend on the particular data center and its data storage requirements. What has tended to happen in recent years{{When?|date=March 2020}}{{Citation Needed|date=March 2020}} is that the amount of data has grown exponentially{{Citation needed|date=November 2011|reason=exponentially is a precise statement; Moore's law probably fits better? Don't have reference}}, with both disk (especially) and tape participating in the growth. In the early twenty-first century [[solid state storage]] encroached on disk's previous near-monopoly in random access non-volatile data storage, while disk pushed into tape's territory to some extent, particularly in situations where sequential data access is only a relatively small part of a particular data center's storage requirements.\n\n==High-density magnetic media==\n[[Sony]] announced, in 2014, that they had developed, using a new vacuum thin-film forming technology able to form extremely fine crystal particles, a tape storage technology with the highest reported magnetic tape data density, 148&nbsp;Gbit/in\u00b2 (23&nbsp;Gbit/cm\u00b2), potentially allowing a native tape capacity of 185&nbsp;TB.<ref name=breakthrough2014>{{cite web|title=Sony develops magnetic tape technology with the world's highest*1 areal recording density of 148 Gb/in2|url=http://www.sony.net/SonyInfo/News/Press/201404/14-044E/index.html|publisher=Sony|accessdate=5 May 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140505022337/http://www.sony.net/SonyInfo/News/Press/201404/14-044E/index.html|archivedate=5 May 2014}}</ref> It was further developed by [[Sony]], with announcement in 2017, about reported data density of 201&nbsp;Gbit/in\u00b2 (31&nbsp;Gbit/cm\u00b2), giving standard compressed tape capacity of 330&nbsp;TB.<ref name=breakthrough2017>{{cite web|title=Sony Develops Magnetic Tape Storage Technology with the Industry's Highest*1 Recording Areal Density of 201 Gb/in2|url=https://www.sony.net/SonyInfo/News/Press/201708/17-070E/index.html|publisher=Sony|accessdate=2018-02-18}}</ref>\n\nIn May 2014, [[Fujifilm]] followed Sony and made an announcement that it will develop a 154&nbsp;TB tape cartridge in conjunction with [[IBM]], which will have an [[Areal density (computer storage)|areal data storage density]] of 85.9 GBit/in\u00b2 (13.3 billion bits per cm\u00b2) on linear magnetic particulate tape.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fujifilm.com/news/n140521.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-06-07 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170616130841/http://www.fujifilm.com/news/n140521.html |archivedate=2017-06-16 }}</ref> The technology developed by Fujifilm, called NANOCUBIC, reduces the particulate volume of BaFe magnetic tape, simultaneously increasing the smoothness of the tape, increasing the signal to noise ratio during read and write while enabling high frequency response.\n\n==Chronological list of tape formats==\n{{see also|Tape drive#History}}\n\n[[Image:Ibm-729v.jpg|thumb|IBM 729V]]\n\n{| style=\"width:65%;\"\n|- valign=top\n| style=\"width:50%;\"|\n* 1951 -

In this case, failure to recognize that different kinds of \"cause\" are being considered can lead to futile debate. Of [[Four causes|Aristotle's four explanatory modes]], the one nearest to the concerns of the present article is the \"efficient\" one.\n\nThe topic of causality remains a staple in [[contemporary philosophy]].\n\n==Concept==\n\n===Metaphysics===\nThe nature of cause and effect is a concern of the subject known as [[metaphysics]]. [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] thought that time and space were notions prior to human understanding of the progress or evolution of the world, and he also recognized the priority of causality. But he did not have the understanding that came with knowledge of [[Minkowski space#Causal structure|Minkowski geometry]] and the [[Special relativity|special theory of relativity]], that the notion of causality can be used as a prior foundation from which to [[Causal structure|construct notions]] of time and space.<ref name=Robb1911/><ref name=Whitehead1929/><ref name=Malament/>\n\n====Ontology====\nA general metaphysical question about cause and effect is what kind of entity can be a cause, and what kind of entity can be an effect.\n\nOne viewpoint on this question is that cause and effect are of one and the same kind of entity, with causality an asymmetric relation between them. That is to say, it would make good sense grammatically to say either \"''A'' is the cause and ''B'' the effect\" or \"''B'' is the cause and ''A'' the effect\", though only one of those two can be actually true. In this view, one opinion, proposed as a metaphysical principle in [[process philosophy]], is that every cause and every effect is respectively some process, event, becoming, or happening.<ref>[[Alfred North Whitehead|Whitehead, A.N.]] (1929). ''Process and Reality. An Essay in Cosmology. Gifford Lectures Delivered in the University of Edinburgh During the Session 1927\u20131928'', Macmillan, New York, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge UK.</ref> An example is 'his tripping over the step was the cause, and his breaking his ankle the effect'. Another view is that causes and effects are 'states of affairs', with the exact natures of those entities being less restrictively defined than in process philosophy.<ref>[[David Malet Armstrong|Armstrong, D.M.]] (1997). ''A World of States of Affairs'', Cambridge University Press, Cambridge UK, {{ISBN|0-521-58064-1}}, pp.&nbsp;89, 265.</ref>\n\nAnother viewpoint on the question is the more classical one, that a cause and its effect can be of different kinds of entity. For example, in Aristotle's efficient causal explanation, an action can be a cause while an [[enduring]] object is its effect. For example, the generative actions of his parents can be regarded as the efficient cause, with Socrates being the effect, Socrates being regarded as an enduring object, in philosophical tradition called a 'substance', as distinct from an action.\n\n====Epistemology====\nSince causality is a subtle metaphysical notion, considerable intellectual effort, along with exhibition of evidence, is needed to establish knowledge of it in particular empirical circumstances. According to [[David Hume]], the human mind is unable to perceive causal relations directly. On this ground, the scholar distinguished between the [[regularity view]] on causality and the counterfactual notion<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hume|first=David|title=The Treatise on Human Nature|publisher=Clarendon Press|year=1888|isbn=|location=Oxford|pages=}}</ref>. According to the [[Counterfactual conditional|counterfactual view]], ''X'' causes ''Y'' if and only if, without ''X, Y'' would not exist. Hume interpreted the latter as an ontological view, i.e., as a description of the nature of causality but, given the limitations of the human mind, advised using the former (stating. roughly, that ''X'' causes ''Y'' if and only if the two events are spatiotemporally conjoined, and ''X'' precedes ''Y'') as an epistemic definition of causality. Having an epistemic concept of causality is needed to distinguish between causal and noncausal relations. The contemporary philosophical literature on causality can be divided into five big approaches to causality. These include the (mentioned above) regularity, [[Probabilistic causation|probabilistic]], counterfactual, [[Mechanism (philosophy)|mechanistic]], and [[Manipulationist causality|manipulationist]] views. The five approaches can be shown to be reductive, i.e., define causality in terms of relations of other types<ref>{{Cite book|last=Maziarz|first=Mariusz|title=The Philosophy of Causality in Economics: Causal Inferences and Policy Proposals.|publisher=Routledge.|year=2020|isbn=|location=New York & London|pages=}}</ref>. According to this reading, they define causality in terms of, respectively, empirical regularities (constant conjunctions of events), changes in conditional probabilities, counterfactual conditions, mechanisms underlying causal relations, and invariance under intervention.\n\n====Geometrical significance====\nCausality has the properties of antecedence and contiguity.<ref name=\"Born\"/><ref name=\"Sklar\"/> These are topological, and are ingredients for space-time geometry.

L. Mackie]] argues that usual talk of \"cause\" in fact refers to '''INUS''' conditions ('''i'''nsufficient but '''n'''on-redundant parts of a condition which is itself '''u'''nnecessary but '''s'''ufficient for the occurrence of the effect).<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h38IAQAAIAAJ|title=The Cement of the Universe: A Study of Causation|last=Mackie|first=John Leslie|date=1974|publisher=Clarendon Press|language=en}}</ref> An example is a short circuit as a cause for a house burning down. Consider the collection of events: the short circuit, the proximity of flammable material, and the absence of firefighters. Together these are unnecessary but sufficient to the house's burning down (since many other collections of events certainly could have led to the house burning down, for example shooting the house with a flamethrower in the presence of oxygen and so forth). Within this collection, the short circuit is an insufficient (since the short circuit by itself would not have caused the fire) but non-redundant (because the fire would not have happened without it, everything else being equal) part of a condition which is itself unnecessary but sufficient for the occurrence of the effect. So, the short circuit is an INUS condition for the occurrence of the house burning down.\n\n===Contrasted with conditionals===\n{{more citations needed|section|reason=Want to read more, want to examine source|date=January 2017}} \n[[Indicative conditional|Conditional]] statements are ''not'' statements of causality. An important distinction is that statements of causality require the antecedent to precede or coincide with the consequent in time, whereas conditional statements do not require this temporal order. Confusion commonly arises since many different statements in English may be presented using \"If ..., then ...\" form (and, arguably, because this form is far more commonly used to make a statement of causality). The two types of statements are distinct, however.\n\nFor example, all of the following statements are true when interpreting \"If ..., then ...\" as the material conditional:\n\n# ''If Barack Obama is president of the United States in 2011, then Germany is in Europe.''\n# ''If George Washington is president of the United States in 2011, then <arbitrary statement>.''\n\nThe first is true since both the [[Antecedent (logic)|antecedent]] and the [[consequent]] are true. The second is true in [[sentential logic]] and indeterminate in natural language, regardless of the consequent statement that follows, because the antecedent is false.\n\nThe ordinary [[indicative conditional]] has somewhat more structure than the material conditional. For instance, although the first is the closest, neither of the preceding two statements seems true as an ordinary indicative reading. But the sentence:\n\n* ''If Shakespeare of Stratford-on-Avon did not write Macbeth, then someone else did.''\nintuitively seems to be true, even though there is no straightforward causal relation in this hypothetical situation between Shakespeare's not writing Macbeth and someone else's actually writing it.\n\nAnother sort of conditional, the [[counterfactual conditional]], has a stronger connection with causality, yet even counterfactual statements are not all examples of causality. Consider the following two statements:\n\n# ''If A were a triangle, then A would have three sides.''\n# ''If switch S were thrown, then bulb B would light.''\n\nIn the first case, it would not be correct to say that A's being a triangle ''caused'' it to have three sides, since the relationship between triangularity and three-sidedness is that of definition. The property of having three sides actually determines A's state as a triangle. Nonetheless, even when interpreted counterfactually, the first statement is true. An early version of Aristotle's \"four cause\" theory is described as recognizing \"essential cause\". In this version of the theory, that the closed polygon has three sides is said to be the \"essential cause\" of its being a triangle.<ref name=\"Graham 1987\"/> This use of the word 'cause' is of course now far obsolete. Nevertheless, it is within the scope of ordinary language to say that it is essential to a triangle that it has three sides.\n\nA full grasp of the concept of conditionals is important to [[understanding]] the literature on causality. In everyday language, loose conditional statements are often enough made, and need to be interpreted carefully.\n\n===Questionable cause===\n{{Main|Questionable cause}}\n\nFallacies of questionable cause, also known as causal fallacies, ''non-causa pro causa'' (Latin for \"non-cause for cause\"), or false cause, are [[informal fallacy|informal fallacies]] where a cause is incorrectly identified.\n\n==Theories==\n{{Main|Causal model}}\n\n===Counterfactual theories===\n{{Main|Counterfactual conditional}}\n\nSubjunctive conditionals are familiar from ordinary language. They are of the form, if A ''were'' the case, then B ''would'' be the case, or if A ''had been'' the case, then B ''would have been'' the case. Counterfactual conditionals are specifically subjunctive conditionals whose antecedents are in fact false, hence the name. However the term used technically may apply to conditionals with true antecedents as well.\n\nPsychological research shows that people's thoughts about the causal relationships between events influences their judgments of the plausibility of counterfactual alternatives, and conversely, their [[counterfactual thinking]] about how a situation could have turned out differently changes their judgments of the causal role of events and agents. Nonetheless, their identification of the cause of an event, and their counterfactual thought about how the event could have turned out differently do not always coincide.<ref>Byrne, R.M.J. (2005).

Doctoral dissertation, Queen Mary University of London.</ref> for example.\n\nIn the philosophical literature, the suggestion that causation is to be defined in terms of a counterfactual relation is made by the 18th-century Scottish philosopher [[David Hume]]. Hume remarks that we may define the relation of cause and effect such that \"where, if the first object had not been, the second never had existed.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hume|first1=David|title=An Enquiry concerning Human Understanding|date=1748|location=Sec. VII}}</ref>\n\nMore full-fledged analysis of causation in terms of counterfactual conditionals only came in the 20th century after development of the possible world semantics for the evaluation of counterfactual conditionals. In his 1973 paper \"Causation,\" [[David Lewis (philosopher)|David Lewis]] proposed the following definition of the notion of ''causal dependence'':<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lewis|first1=David|title=Causation|journal=The Journal of Philosophy|date=1973|volume=70|issue=17}}</ref>\n\n:An event E ''causally depends'' on C if, and only if, (i) if C had occurred, then E would have occurred, and (ii) if C had not occurred, then E would not have occurred.\n\nCausation is then defined as a chain of causal dependence. That is, C causes E if and only if there exists a sequence of events C, D<sub>1</sub>, D<sub>2</sub>, ... D<sub>k</sub>, E such that each event in the sequence depends on the previous. The word 'mechanism' may be used to refer to such a chain.\n\nNote that the analysis does not purport to explain how we make causal judgements or how we reason about causation, but rather to give a metaphysical account of what it is for there to be a causal relation between some pair of events. If correct, the analysis has the power to explain certain features of causation. Knowing that causation is a matter of counterfactual dependence, we may reflect on the nature of counterfactual dependence to account for the nature of causation. For example, in his paper \"Counterfactual Dependence and Time's Arrow,\" Lewis sought to account for the time-directedness of counterfactual dependence in terms of the semantics of the counterfactual conditional.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lewis|first1=David|title=Counterfactual Dependence and Time's Arrow|journal=Nous|date=1979|volume=13|issue=4}}</ref> If correct, this theory can serve to explain a fundamental part of our experience, which is that we can only causally affect the future but not the past.\n\n===Probabilistic causation===\n{{Main|Probabilistic causation}}\nInterpreting causation as a [[Determinism|deterministic]] relation means that if ''A'' causes ''B'', then ''A'' must ''always'' be followed by ''B''. In this sense, war does not cause deaths, nor does [[Tobacco smoking|smoking]] cause [[cancer]] or [[emphysema]]. As a result, many turn to a notion of probabilistic causation. Informally, ''A'' (\"The person is a smoker\") probabilistically causes ''B'' (\"The person has now or will have cancer at some time in the future\"), if the information that ''A'' occurred increases the likelihood of ''B''s occurrence. Formally, P{''B''|''A''}\u2265 P{''B''} where P{''B''|''A''} is the conditional probability that ''B'' will occur given the information that ''A'' occurred, and P{''B''}is the probability that ''B'' will occur having no knowledge whether ''A'' did or did not occur. This intuitive condition is not adequate as a definition for probabilistic causation because of its being too general and thus not meeting our intuitive notion of cause and effect.  For example, if ''A'' denotes the event \"The person is a smoker,\" ''B'' denotes the event \"The person now has or will have cancer at some time in the future\" and ''C'' denotes the event \"The person now has or will have emphysema some time in the future,\" then the following three relationships hold: P{''B''|''A''} \u2265 P{''B''}, P{''C''|''A''} \u2265 P{''C''} and P{''B''|''C''} \u2265 P{''B''}.  The last relationship states that knowing that the person has emphysema increases the likelihood that he will have cancer.  The reason for this is that having the information that the person has emphysema increases the likelihood that the person is a smoker, thus indirectly increasing the likelihood that the person will have cancer.  However, we would not want to conclude that having emphysema causes cancer. Thus, we need additional conditions such as temporal relationship of ''A'' to ''B'' and a rational explanation as to the mechanism of action. It is hard to quantify this last requirement and thus different authors prefer somewhat different definitions.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\n===Causal calculus===\nWhen experimental interventions are infeasible or illegal, the derivation of cause effect relationship from observational studies must rest on some qualitative theoretical assumptions, for example, that symptoms do not cause diseases, usually expressed in the form of missing arrows in [[causal graphs]] such as [[Bayesian network]]s or [[path analysis (statistics)|path diagrams]]. The theory underlying these derivations relies on the distinction between ''conditional probabilities'', as in <math>P(cancer|smoking)</math>, and ''interventional probabilities'', as in <math>P(cancer|do(smoking))</math>. The former reads: \"the probability of finding cancer in a person known to smoke, having started, unforced by the experimenter, to do so at an unspecified time in the past\", while the latter reads: \"the probability of finding cancer in a person forced by the experimenter to smoke at a specified time in the past\". The former is a statistical notion that can be estimated by observation with negligible intervention by the experimenter, while the latter is a causal notion which is estimated in an experiment with an important controlled randomized intervention. It is specifically characteristic of [[quantum mechanics|quantal phenomena]] that observations defined by incompatible variables always involve important intervention by the experimenter, as described quantitatively by the [[Observer effect (physics)|observer effect]].{{Vague|date=June 2016}} In classical [[thermodynamics]], [[thermodynamic process|processes]] are initiated by interventions called [[thermodynamic operation]]s. In other branches of science, for example [[astronomy]], the experimenter can often observe with negligible intervention.\n\nThe theory of \"causal calculus\"<ref name=Pearl>Pearl, Judea (2000). ''[https://www.google.com/books/edition/_/wnGU_TsW3BQC?hl=en&gbpv=1 Causality: Models, Reasoning, and Inference]'', Cambridge University Press.</ref> (also known as do-calculus, [[Judea Pearl]]'s Causal Calculus, Calculus of\nActions) permits one to infer interventional probabilities from conditional probabilities in causal [[Bayesian network]]s with unmeasured variables. One very practical result of this theory is the characterization of [[confounding variables]], namely, a sufficient set of variables that, if adjusted for, would yield the correct causal effect between variables of interest. It can be shown that a sufficient set for estimating the causal effect of <math>X</math> on <math>Y</math> is any set of non-descendants of <math>X</math> that <math>d</math>-separate <math>X</math> from <math>Y</math> after removing all arrows emanating from <math>X</math>. This criterion, called \"backdoor\", provides a mathematical definition of \"confounding\" and helps researchers identify accessible sets of variables worthy of measurement.\n\n===Structure learning===\nWhile derivations in causal calculus rely on the structure of the causal graph, parts of the causal structure can, under certain assumptions, be learned from statistical data. The basic idea goes back to [[Sewall Wright]]'s 1921 work<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Wright | first1 = S | year = | title = Correlation and Causation | url = | journal = Journal of Agricultural Research | volume = 20 | issue = 7| pages = 557\u2013585 }}</ref> on [[Path analysis (statistics)|path analysis]]. A \"recovery\" algorithm was developed by Rebane and Pearl (1987)<ref>Rebane, G. and Pearl, J., \"[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1304.2736 The Recovery of Causal Poly-trees from Statistical Data]\", ''Proceedings, 3rd Workshop on Uncertainty in AI'', (Seattle) pp. 222\u2013228, 1987</ref> which rests on Wright's distinction between the three possible types of causal substructures allowed in a [[directed acyclic graph]] (DAG):\n\n# <math>X \\rightarrow Y \\rightarrow Z</math>\n# <math>X \\leftarrow Y \\rightarrow Z</math>\n# <math>X \\rightarrow Y \\leftarrow Z</math>\n\nType 1 and type 2 represent the same statistical dependencies (i.e., <math>X</math> and <math>Z</math> are independent given <math>Y</math>) and are, therefore, indistinguishable within purely [[cross-sectional data]]. Type 3, however, can be uniquely identified, since <math>X</math> and <math>Z</math> are marginally independent and all other pairs are dependent. Thus, while the ''skeletons'' (the graphs stripped of arrows) of these three triplets are identical, the directionality of the arrows is partially identifiable. The same distinction applies when <math>X</math> and <math>Z</math> have common ancestors, except that one must first condition on those ancestors. Algorithms have been developed to systematically determine the skeleton of the underlying graph and, then, orient all arrows whose directionality is dictated by the conditional independencies observed.<ref name=\"Pearl\" /><ref>Spirites, P. and Glymour, C., \"An algorithm for fast recovery of sparse causal graphs\", ''Social Science Computer Review'', Vol. 9, pp. 62\u201372, 1991.</ref><ref>Spirtes, P. and Glymour, C. and Scheines, R., ''Causation, Prediction, and Search'', New York: Springer-Verlag, 1993</ref><ref>Verma, T. and Pearl, J., \"[http://ftp.cs.ucla.edu/pub/stat_ser/R150.pdf Equivalence and Synthesis of Causal Models]\", ''Proceedings of the Sixth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence'', (July, Cambridge, Massachusetts), pp. 220\u2013227, 1990.

Kanal and J.F.\\ Lemmer (Eds.), ''Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence 6'', Amsterdam: Elsevier Science Publishers, B.V., pp. 225\u2013268, 1991</ref>\n\nAlternative methods of structure learning search through the ''many'' possible causal structures among the variables, and remove ones which are strongly incompatible with the observed [[correlation]]s. In general this leaves a set of possible causal relations, which should then be tested by analyzing time series data or, preferably, designing appropriately controlled [[experiment]]s. In contrast with Bayesian Networks, [[path analysis (statistics)|path analysis]] (and its generalization, [[structural equation model]]ing), serve better to estimate a known causal effect or to test a causal model than to generate causal hypotheses.\n\nFor nonexperimental data, causal direction can often be inferred if information about time is available. This is because (according to many, though not all, theories) causes must precede their effects temporally. This can be determined by statistical [[time series]] models, for instance, or with a statistical test based on the idea of [[Granger causality]], or by direct experimental manipulation. The use of temporal data can permit statistical tests of a pre-existing theory of causal direction. For instance, our degree of confidence in the direction and nature of causality is much greater when supported by [[cross-correlation]]s, [[ARIMA]] models, or [[Cross-spectrum|cross-spectral analysis]] using vector time series data than by [[cross-sectional data]].\n\n===Derivation theories===\nNobel Prize laureate [[Herbert A. Simon]] and philosopher [[Nicholas Rescher]]<ref name=\"SimRes\">{{cite journal | last1 = Simon | first1 = Herbert | last2 = Rescher | first2 = Nicholas | year = 1966 | title = Cause and Counterfactual | url = | journal = Philosophy of Science | volume = 33 | issue = 4| pages = 323\u2013340 | doi=10.1086/288105}}</ref> claim that the asymmetry of the causal relation is unrelated to the asymmetry of any mode of implication that contraposes. Rather, a causal relation is not a relation between values of variables, but a function of one variable (the cause) on to another (the effect). So, given a system of equations, and a set of variables appearing in these equations, we can introduce an asymmetric relation among individual equations and variables that corresponds perfectly to our commonsense notion of a causal ordering. The system of equations must have certain properties, most importantly, if some values are chosen arbitrarily, the remaining values will be determined uniquely through a path of serial discovery that is perfectly causal. They postulate the inherent serialization of such a system of equations may correctly capture causation in all empirical fields, including physics and economics.\n\n===Manipulation theories===\nSome theorists have equated causality with manipulability.<ref name=\"Collingwood\">Collingwood, R. (1940) ''An Essay on Metaphysics.''

(1971) ''Explanation and Understanding.'' [[Cornell University Press]].</ref> Under these theories, ''x'' causes ''y'' only in the case that one can change ''x'' in order to change ''y''. This coincides with commonsense notions of causations, since often we ask causal questions in order to change some feature of the world. For instance, we are interested in knowing the causes of crime so that we might find ways of reducing it.\n\nThese theories have been criticized on two primary grounds. First, theorists complain that these accounts are [[Begging the question|circular]]. Attempting to reduce causal claims to manipulation requires that manipulation is more basic than causal interaction. But describing manipulations in non-causal terms has provided a substantial difficulty.\n\nThe second criticism centers around concerns of [[anthropocentrism]]. It seems to many people that causality is some existing relationship in the world that we can harness for our desires. If causality is identified with our manipulation, then this intuition is lost. In this sense, it makes humans overly central to interactions in the world.\n\nSome attempts to defend manipulability theories are recent accounts that don't claim to reduce causality to manipulation. These accounts use manipulation as a sign or feature in causation without claiming that manipulation is more fundamental than causation.<ref name=\"Pearl\" /><!-- Pearl, Judea (2000) ''Causality'', Cambridge University Press, ISBN 0-521-77362-8</ref> --><ref name=\"Woodward\">Woodward, James (2003) ''Making Things Happen: A Theory of Causal Explanation''. [[Oxford University Press]], {{ISBN|0-19-515527-0}}</ref>\n\n===Process theories===\nSome theorists are interested in distinguishing between causal processes and non-causal processes (Russell 1948; Salmon 1984).<ref name=\"Salmon\">Salmon, W. (1984) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=2ug9DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false Scientific Explanation and the Causal Structure of the World]''. Princeton University Press.</ref><ref name=\"Russell\">Russell, B. (1948) ''Human Knowledge''. Simon and Schuster.</ref> These theorists often want to distinguish between a process and a [[pseudo-process]]. As an example, a ball moving through the air (a process) is contrasted with the motion of a shadow (a pseudo-process). The former is causal in nature while the latter is not.\n\nSalmon (1984)<ref name=\"Salmon\" /> claims that causal processes can be identified by their ability to transmit an alteration over space and time. An alteration of the ball (a mark by a pen, perhaps) is carried with it as the ball goes through the air. On the other hand, an alteration of the shadow (insofar as it is possible) will not be transmitted by the shadow as it moves along.\n\nThese theorists claim that the important concept for understanding causality is not causal relationships or causal interactions, but rather identifying causal processes. The former notions can then be defined in terms of causal processes.\n\n[[File:Herald of Free Enterprise WBG.png|thumb|600px|center|[[Why-Because analysis|Why-Because]] Graph of the capsizing of the [[Herald of Free Enterprise]] (click to see in detail).]]A subgroup of the process theories is the mechanistic view on causality. It states that that causal relations supervene on mechanisms. While the notion of mechanism is understood differently, the definition put forward by the group of philosophers referred to as the \u2018New Mechanists\u2019 dominate the literature<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Williamson|first=Jon|date=2011|title=Mechanistic theories of causality part I|url=|journal=Philosophy Compass|volume=6(6)|pages=421-432|via=}}</ref>.\n\n==Fields==\n\n===Science===\nFor the scientific investigation of efficient causality, the cause and effect are each best conceived of as temporally transient processes.\n\nWithin the conceptual frame of the [[scientific method]], an investigator sets up several distinct and contrasting temporally transient material processes that have the structure of [[experiment]]s, and records candidate material responses, normally intending  to determine causality in the physical world.<ref>[[Max Born|Born, M.]] (1949). ''Natural Philosophy of Cause and Chance'', Oxford University Press, Oxford UK, p. 18: \"... scientific work will always be the search for causal interdependence of phenomena.\"</ref> For instance, one may want to [[know]] whether a high intake of [[carrot]]s causes humans to develop the [[bubonic plague]]. The quantity of carrot intake is a process that is varied from occasion to occasion. The occurrence or non-occurrence of subsequent bubonic plague is recorded. To establish causality, the experiment must fulfill certain criteria, only one example of which is mentioned here. For example, instances of the hypothesized cause must be set up to occur at a time when the hypothesized effect is relatively unlikely in the absence of the hypothesized cause; such unlikelihood is to be established by empirical evidence. A mere observation of a [[correlation does not imply causation|correlation]] is not nearly adequate to establish causality. In nearly all cases, establishment of causality relies on repetition of experiments and probabilistic reasoning. Hardly ever is causality established more firmly than as more or less probable. It is most convenient for establishment of causality if the contrasting material states of affairs are precisely matched, except for only one variable factor, perhaps measured by a real number.\n\n====Physics====\n{{Main|Causality (physics)}}\n\nOne has to be careful in the use of the word cause in physics. Properly speaking, the hypothesized cause and the hypothesized effect are each temporally transient processes. For example, force is a useful concept for the explanation of acceleration, but force is not by itself a cause. More is needed. For example, a temporally transient process might be characterized by a definite change of force at a definite time. Such a process can be regarded as a cause. Causality is not inherently implied in [[equations of motion]], but postulated as an additional [[constraint (classical mechanics)|constraint]] that needs to be satisfied (i.e. a cause always precedes its effect). This constraint has mathematical implications<ref name=kinsler2011>\n{{cite journal\n| author=Kinsler, P.\n| year=2011\n| title=How to be causal\n| journal=Eur. J.

Any actual process has causal efficacy that can propagate no faster than light. In contrast, an abstraction has no causal efficacy. Its mathematical expression does not propagate in the ordinary sense of the word, though it may refer to virtual or nominal 'velocities' with magnitudes greater than that of light. For example, wave packets are mathematical objects that have [[group velocity]] and [[phase velocity]]. The energy of a wave packet travels at the group velocity (under normal circumstances); since energy has causal efficacy, the group velocity cannot be faster than the speed of light. The phase of a wave packet travels at the phase velocity; since phase is not causal, the phase velocity of a wave packet can be faster than light.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Griffiths |first1=David |title=Introduction to electrodynamics |date=2017 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1-108-42041-9 |page=418 |edition=Fourth}}</ref>\n\nCausal notions are important in general relativity to the extent that the existence of an arrow of time demands that the universe's semi-Riemannian manifold be orientable, so that \"future\" and \"past\" are globally definable quantities.\n\n====Engineering====\nA [[causal system]] is a [[system]] with output and internal states that depends only on the current and previous input values. A system that has ''some'' dependence on input values from the future (in addition to possible past or current input values) is termed an '''acausal''' system, and a system that depends ''solely'' on future input values is an [[anticausal system]]. Acausal filters, for example, can only exist as postprocessing filters, because these filters can extract future values from a memory buffer or a file.\n\n====Biology, medicine and epidemiology====\n[[Austin Bradford Hill]] built upon the work of [[David Hume|Hume]] and [[Karl Popper|Popper]] and suggested in his paper \"The Environment and Disease: Association or Causation?\" that aspects of an association such as strength, consistency, specificity and temporality be considered in attempting to distinguish causal from noncausal associations in the epidemiological situation. (See [[Bradford-Hill criteria]].) He did not note however, that temporality is the only necessary criterion among those aspects. Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) are increasingly used in epidemiology to help enlighten causal thinking.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Chiolero|first=A|author2=Paradis, G |author3=Kaufman, JS |title=Assessing the possible direct effect of birth weight on childhood blood pressure: a sensitivity analysis|journal=American Journal of Epidemiology|date=1 January 2014|volume=179|issue=1|pages=4\u201311|pmid=24186972|doi=10.1093/aje/kwt228|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\n====Psychology====\n{{Main|Causal reasoning}}\nPsychologists take an empirical approach to causality, investigating how people and non-human animals detect or infer causation from sensory information, prior experience and [[innatism|innate knowledge]].\n\n;Attribution\n[[Attribution theory]] is the [[theory]] concerning how people explain individual occurrences of causation. [[Attribution (psychology)|Attribution]] can be external (assigning causality to an outside agent or force\u2014claiming that some outside thing motivated the event) or internal (assigning causality to factors within the person\u2014taking personal [[Moral responsibility|responsibility]] or [[accountability]] for one's actions and claiming that the person was directly responsible for the event). Taking causation one step further, the type of attribution a person provides influences their future behavior.\n\nThe intention behind the cause or the effect can be covered by the subject of [[action (philosophy)|action]]. See also [[accident]]; [[blame]]; [[intent (law)|intent]]; and responsibility.\n\n;Causal powers\nWhereas [[David Hume#Causation|David Hume]] argued that causes are inferred from non-causal observations, [[Immanuel Kant]] claimed that people have innate assumptions about causes. Within psychology, [[Patricia Cheng]]<ref name=\"Cheng1997\"/> attempted to reconcile the Humean and Kantian views. According to her power PC theory, people filter observations of events through an intuition that causes have the power to generate (or prevent) their effects, thereby inferring specific cause-effect relations.\n\n;Causation and salience\nOur view of causation depends on what we consider to be the relevant events. Another way to view the statement, \"Lightning causes thunder\" is to see both lightning and thunder as two perceptions of the same event, viz., an electric discharge that we perceive first visually and then aurally.\n\n;Naming and causality\nDavid Sobel and Alison Gopnik from the Psychology Department of UC Berkeley designed a device known as ''the blicket detector'' which would turn on when an object was placed on it. Their research suggests that \"even young children will easily and swiftly learn about a new causal power of an object and spontaneously use that information in classifying and naming the object.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Gopnik |first1=A |first2=David M. |last2=Sobel |title=Detecting Blickets: How Young Children Use Information about Novel Causal Powers in Categorization and Induction |journal=Child Development |date=September\u2013October 2000 |volume=71 |issue=5 |pages=1205\u20131222 |doi=10.1111/1467-8624.00224 |pmid=11108092}}</ref>\n\n;Perception of launching events\nSome researchers such as Anjan Chatterjee at the University of Pennsylvania and Jonathan Fugelsang at the University of Waterloo are using neuroscience techniques to investigate the neural and psychological underpinnings of causal launching events in which one object causes another object to move.

The body of statistical techniques involves substantial use of [[regression analysis]]. Typically a linear relationship such as\n\n:<math>y_i = a_0 + a_1x_{1,i} + a_2x_{2,i} + ... + a_kx_{k,i} + e_i</math>\n\nis postulated, in which <math>y_i</math> is the ''i''th observation of the dependent variable (hypothesized to be the caused variable), <math>x_{j,i}</math> for ''j''=1,...,''k'' is the ''i''th observation on the ''j''th independent variable (hypothesized to be a causative variable), and <math>e_i</math> is the error term for the ''i''th observation (containing the combined effects of all other causative variables, which must be uncorrelated with the included independent variables). If there is reason to believe that none of the <math>x_j</math>s is caused by ''y'', then estimates of the coefficients <math>a_j</math> are obtained. If the null hypothesis that <math>a_j=0</math> is rejected, then the alternative hypothesis that <math>a_{j} \\ne 0 </math> and equivalently that <math>x_j</math> causes ''y'' cannot be rejected. On the other hand, if the null hypothesis that <math>a_j=0</math> cannot be rejected, then equivalently the hypothesis of no causal effect of <math>x_j</math> on ''y'' cannot be rejected. Here the notion of causality is one of contributory causality as discussed [[Causality#Necessary and sufficient causes|above]]: If the true value <math>a_j \\ne 0</math>, then a change in <math>x_j</math> will result in a change in ''y'' ''unless'' some other causative variable(s), either included in the regression or implicit in the error term, change in such a way as to exactly offset its effect; thus a change in <math>x_j</math> is ''not sufficient'' to change ''y''. Likewise, a change in <math>x_j</math> is ''not necessary'' to change ''y'', because a change in ''y'' could be caused by something implicit in the error term (or by some other causative explanatory variable included in the model).\n\nThe above way of testing for causality requires belief that there is no reverse causation, in which ''y'' would cause <math>x_j</math>. This belief can be established in one of several ways. First, the variable <math>x_j</math> may be a non-economic variable: for example, if rainfall amount <math>x_j</math> is hypothesized to affect the futures price ''y'' of some agricultural commodity, it is impossible that in fact the futures price affects rainfall amount (provided that cloud seeding is never attempted). Second, the [[instrumental variables]] technique may be employed to remove any reverse causation by introducing a role for other variables (instruments) that are known to be unaffected by the dependent variable. Third, the principle that effects cannot precede causes can be invoked, by including on the right side of the regression only variables that precede in time the dependent variable; this principle is invoked, for example, in testing for [[Granger causality]] and in its multivariate analog, [[vector autoregression]], both of which control for lagged values of the dependent variable while testing for causal effects of lagged independent variables.\n\nRegression analysis controls for other relevant variables by including them as regressors (explanatory variables). This helps to avoid false inferences of causality due to the presence of a third, underlying, variable that influences both the potentially causative variable and the potentially caused variable: its effect on the potentially caused variable is captured by directly including it in the regression, so that effect will not be picked up as an indirect effect through the potentially causative variable of interest. Given the above procedures, coincidental (as opposed to causal) correlation can be probabilistically rejected if data samples are large and if regression results pass [[Cross-validation (statistics)|cross-validation]] tests showing that the correlations hold even for data that were not used in the regression.However, asserting with certitude that a common-cause is absent and the regression represents the true causal structure is ''in principle'' impossible<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Henschen|first=Tobias|date=2018|title=The in-principle inconclusiveness of causal evidence in macroeconomics|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13194-018-0207-7|journal=European Journal for the Philosophy of Science|volume=8(3)|pages=709-733|via=}}</ref>.\n\nApart from constructing statistical models of observational and experimental data, economists use axiomatic (mathematical) models to infer and represent causal mechanisms. Highly abstract theoretical models that isolate and idealize one mechanism dominate microeconomics. In macroeconomics, economists use broad mathematical models that are calibrated on historical data.

The diagram categorizes causes, such as into the six main categories shown here. These categories are then sub-divided. Ishikawa's method identifies \"causes\" in brainstorming sessions conducted among various groups involved in the manufacturing process. These groups can then be labeled as categories in the diagrams. The use of these diagrams has now spread beyond quality control, and they are used in other areas of management and in design and engineering. Ishikawa diagrams have been criticized for failing to make the distinction between necessary conditions and sufficient conditions. It seems that Ishikawa was not even aware of this distinction.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Gregory | first1 = Frank Hutson | year = 1992 | title = Cause, Effect, Efficiency & Soft Systems Models, Warwick Business School Research Paper No. 42 |issn=0160-5682 | url = | journal = Journal of the Operational Research Society | volume = 44 | issue = 4| pages = 333\u2013344 | doi=10.1057/jors.1993.63| title-link = s:Cause, Effect, Efficiency & Soft Systems Models }}</ref>\n\n===Humanities===\n\n====History====\nIn the discussion of history, events are sometimes considered as if in some way being agents that can then bring about other historical events.

It has four intricate causal conditioning constructions with the: 1) root cause, 2) immediate antecedent, 3) object support, and 4) predominance. Then, the six causes are: 1) instrumentality (k\u0101ra\u1e47ahetu), deemed the primary factor in result production; 2) simultaneity or coexistence, which connects phenomena that arise simultaneously; 3) homogeneity, explaining the homogenous flow that evokes phenomena continuity; 4) association, which operates only between mental factors and explains why consciousness appears as assemblages to mental factors; 5) dominance, which forms one's habitual cognitive and behaviorist dispositions; and 6) fruition, referring to whatever is the actively wholesome or unwholesome result. The four conditions and six causes interact with each other in explaining phenomenal experience: for instance, each conscious moment acts both as the homogenous cause, as well as the immediate antecedent consciousness condition rise, and its concomitants, in a subsequent moment.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\nThe [[Vaibhashika]] (c. 500 CE) is an [[early buddhist school]] which favors direct object contact and accepts simultaneous cause and effects.

Here Aristotle insists that all four modes of explanation are called for in the study of natural phenomena, and that the job of \"the student of nature is to bring the why-question back to them all in the way appropriate to the science of nature\" (''Phys.'' 198 a 21\u201323). The best way to understand this methodological recommendation is the following: the science of nature is concerned with natural bodies insofar as they are subject to change, and the job of the student of nature is to provide the explanation of their natural change. The factors that are involved in the explanation of natural change turn out to be matter, form, that which produces the change, and the end of this change. Note that Aristotle does not say that all four explanatory factors are involved in the explanation of each and every instance of natural change. Rather, he says that an adequate explanation of natural change may involve a reference to all of them. Aristotle goes on by adding a specification on his doctrine of the four causes: the form and the end often coincide, and they are formally the same as that which produces the change (''Phys.'' 198 a 23\u201326).}}</ref>\n* [[Efficient cause]], which imparts the first relevant ''movement'', as a human lifts a rock or raises a statue. This is the main topic of the present article.\n* [[Final cause]], the criterion of completion, or the [[Telos (philosophy)|end]]; it may refer to an action or to an inanimate process. Examples: Socrates takes a walk after dinner for the sake of his health; earth falls to the lowest level because that is its nature.\n\nOf Aristotle's four kinds or explanatory modes, only one, the 'efficient cause' is a cause as defined in the leading paragraph of this present article. The other three explanatory modes might be rendered material composition, structure and dynamics, and, again, criterion of completion. The word that Aristotle used was {{math|\u03b1\u1f30\u03c4\u03af\u03b1}}. For the present purpose, that Greek word would be better translated as \"explanation\" than as \"cause\" as those words are most often used in current English. Another translation of Aristotle is that he meant \"the four Becauses\" as four kinds of answer to \"why\" questions.<ref name=\"Graham 1987\"/>\n\nAristotle assumed efficient causality as referring to a basic fact of experience, not explicable by, or reducible to, anything more fundamental or basic.\n\nIn some works of Aristotle, the four causes are listed as (1) the essential cause, (2) the logical ground, (3) the moving cause, and (4) the final cause. In this listing, a statement of essential cause is a demonstration that an indicated object conforms to a definition of the word that refers to it. A statement of logical ground is an argument as to why an object statement is true. These are further examples of the idea that a \"cause\" in general in the context of Aristotle's usage is an \"explanation\".<ref name=\"Graham 1987\"/>\n\nThe word \"efficient\" used here can also be translated from Aristotle as \"moving\" or \"initiating\".<ref name=\"Graham 1987\"/>\n\nEfficient causation was connected with [[Aristotelian physics]], which recognized the [[four classical elements|four elements]] (earth, air, fire, water), and added the [[Aether (classical element)|fifth element]] (aether). Water and earth by their intrinsic property ''gravitas'' or heaviness intrinsically fall toward, whereas air and fire by their intrinsic property ''levitas'' or lightness intrinsically rise away from, Earth's center\u2014the motionless center of the universe\u2014in a straight line while accelerating during the substance's approach to its natural place.\n\nAs air remained on Earth, however, and did not escape Earth while eventually achieving infinite speed\u2014an absurdity\u2014Aristotle inferred that the universe is finite in size and contains an invisible substance that held planet Earth and its atmosphere, the [[sublunary sphere]], centered in the universe. And since celestial bodies exhibit perpetual, unaccelerated motion orbiting planet Earth in unchanging relations, Aristotle inferred that the fifth element, ''aither'', that fills space and composes celestial bodies intrinsically moves in perpetual circles, the only constant motion between two points. (An object traveling a straight line from point ''A'' to ''B'' and back must stop at either point before returning to the other.)\n\nLeft to itself, a thing exhibits ''natural motion'', but can\u2014according to [[Aristotelian metaphysics]]\u2014exhibit ''enforced motion'' imparted by an efficient cause. The form of plants endows plants with the processes nutrition and reproduction, the form of animals adds locomotion, and the form of humankind adds reason atop these. A rock normally exhibits ''natural motion''\u2014explained by the rock's material cause of being composed of the element earth\u2014but a living thing can lift the rock, an ''enforced motion'' diverting the rock from its natural place and natural motion. As a further kind of explanation, Aristotle identified the final cause, specifying a purpose or criterion of completion in light of which something should be understood.\n\nAristotle himself explained,\n\n{{Quotation|''Cause'' means\n\n(a) in one sense, that as the result of whose presence something comes into being\u2014e.g., the bronze of a statue and the silver of a cup, and the classes which contain these [i.e., the '''material cause'''];\n\n(b) in another sense, the form or pattern; that is, the essential formula and the classes which contain it\u2014e.g. the ratio 2:1 and number in general is the cause of the octave\u2014and the parts of the formula [i.e., the '''formal cause'''].\n\n(c) The source of the first beginning of change or rest; e.g. the man who plans is a cause, and the father is the cause of the child, and in general that which produces is the cause of that which is produced, and that which changes of that which is changed [i.e., the '''efficient cause'''].\n\n(d) The same as \"end\"; i.e. the final cause; e.g., as the \"end\" of walking is health. For why does a man walk? \"To be healthy\", we say, and by saying this we consider that we have supplied the cause [the '''final cause'''].\n\n(e) All those means towards the end which arise at the instigation of something else, as, e.g., fat-reducing, purging, drugs and instruments are causes of health; for they all have the end as their object, although they differ from each other as being some instruments, others actions [i.e., necessary conditions].|Metaphysics, Book 5, section 1013a, translated by Hugh Tredennick<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0052%3Abook%3D5%3Asection%3D1013a Aristotle.

All causes, proper and accidental, can be spoken as potential or as actual, particular or generic. The same language refers to the effects of causes, so that generic effects are assigned to generic causes, particular effects to particular causes, and actual effects to operating causes.\n\nAverting [[infinite regress]], Aristotle inferred the first mover\u2014an [[unmoved mover]]. The first mover's motion, too, must have been caused, but, being an unmoved mover, must have moved only toward a particular goal or desire.\n\n====Middle Ages====\nIn line with Aristotelian cosmology, [[Thomas Aquinas]] posed a hierarchy prioritizing Aristotle's four causes: \"final > efficient > material > formal\".<ref name=\"The Thomist article\">{{cite journal|journal=The Thomist|author=William E.

Later in the Middle Ages, many scholars conceded that the first cause was God, but explained that many earthly events occur within God's design or plan, and thereby scholars sought freedom to investigate the numerous ''secondary causes''.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=O\u2019Meara |first1=T.F. |title=The dignity of being a cause |journal=Open Theology |date=2018 |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=186\u2013191 |doi=10.1515/opth-2018-0013|doi-access=free }}</ref>\n\n====After the Middle Ages====\n<!--[[David Hume]] links here-->\n{{See also|Humean definition of causality}}\nFor Aristotelian philosophy before Aquinas, the word cause had a broad meaning. It meant 'answer to a why question' or 'explanation', and Aristotelian scholars recognized four kinds of such answers. With the end of the [[Middle Ages]], in many philosophical usages, the meaning of the word 'cause' narrowed. It often lost that broad meaning, and was restricted to just one of the four kinds. For authors such as [[Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli]], in the field of political thinking, and [[Francis Bacon]], concerning [[science]] more generally, Aristotle's moving cause was the focus of their interest. A widely used modern definition of causality in this newly narrowed sense was assumed by [[David Hume]].<ref name=\"The Thomist article\"/> He undertook an epistemological and metaphysical investigation of the notion of moving cause. He denied that we can ever perceive cause and effect, except by developing a habit or custom of mind where we come to associate two types of object or event, always contiguous and occurring one after the other.<ref>{{Citation|first=David|last=Hume|title= A Treatise of Human Nature|origyear=1739|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/4705/4705-h/4705-h.htm|editor-last=Selby-Bigge|publisher=Clarendon Press|year=1896}}</ref> In Part III, section XV of his book ''[[A Treatise of Human Nature]]'', Hume expanded this to a list of eight ways of judging whether two things might be cause and effect. The first three:\n\n:1. \"The cause and effect must be contiguous in space and time.\"\n:2. \"The cause must be prior to the effect.\"\n:3. \"There must be a constant union betwixt the cause and effect. 'Tis chiefly this quality, that constitutes the relation.\"\nAnd then additionally there are three connected criteria which come from our experience and which are \"the source of most of our philosophical reasonings\":\n:4. \"The same cause always produces the same effect, and the same effect never arises but from the same cause. This principle we derive from experience, and is the source of most of our philosophical reasonings.\"\n:5. Hanging upon the above, Hume says that \"where several different objects produce the same effect, it must be by means of some quality, which we discover to be common amongst them.\"\n:6. And \"founded on the same reason\": \"The difference in the effects of two resembling objects must proceed from that particular, in which they differ.\"\nAnd then two more:\n:7. \"When any object increases or diminishes with the increase or diminution of its cause, 'tis to be regarded as a compounded effect, deriv'd from the union of the several different effects, which arise from the several different parts of the cause.\"\n:8. An \"object, which exists for any time in its full perfection without any effect, is not the sole cause of that effect, but requires to be assisted by some other principle, which may forward its influence and operation.\"\n\nIn 1949, physicist [[Max Born]] distinguished determination from causality. For him, determination meant that actual events are so linked by laws of nature that certainly reliable predictions and retrodictions can be made from sufficient present data about them. He describes two kinds of causation: nomic or generic causation and singular causation. Nomic causality means that cause and effect are linked by more or less certain or probabilistic general laws covering many possible or potential instances; this can be recognized as a probabilized version of Hume's criterion 3. An occasion of singular causation is a particular occurrence of a definite complex of events that are physically linked by antecedence and contiguity, which may be recognized as criteria 1 and 2.<ref name=\"Born\">[[Max Born|Born, M.]] (1949).

For example, in Aristotle's efficient causal explanation, an action can be a cause while an [[enduring]] object is its effect. For example, the generative actions of his parents can be regarded as the efficient cause, with Socrates being the effect, Socrates being regarded as an enduring object, in philosophical tradition called a 'substance', as distinct from an action.\n\n====Epistemology====\nSince causality is a subtle metaphysical notion, considerable intellectual effort, along with exhibition of evidence, is needed to establish knowledge of it in particular empirical circumstances. According to [[David Hume]], the human mind is unable to perceive causal relations directly. On this ground, the scholar distinguished between the [[regularity view]] on causality and the counterfactual notion<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hume|first=David|title=The Treatise on Human Nature|publisher=Clarendon Press|year=1888|isbn=|location=Oxford|pages=}}</ref>. According to the [[Counterfactual conditional|counterfactual view]], ''X'' causes ''Y'' if and only if, without ''X, Y'' would not exist. Hume interpreted the latter as an ontological view, i.e., as a description of the nature of causality but, given the limitations of the human mind, advised using the former (stating. roughly, that ''X'' causes ''Y'' if and only if the two events are spatiotemporally conjoined, and ''X'' precedes ''Y'') as an epistemic definition of causality. Having an epistemic concept of causality is needed to distinguish between causal and noncausal relations. The contemporary philosophical literature on causality can be divided into five big approaches to causality. These include the (mentioned above) regularity, [[Probabilistic causation|probabilistic]], counterfactual, [[Mechanism (philosophy)|mechanistic]], and [[Manipulationist causality|manipulationist]] views. The five approaches can be shown to be reductive, i.e., define causality in terms of relations of other types<ref>{{Cite book|last=Maziarz|first=Mariusz|title=The Philosophy of Causality in Economics: Causal Inferences and Policy Proposals.|publisher=Routledge.|year=2020|isbn=|location=New York & London|pages=}}</ref>. According to this reading, they define causality in terms of, respectively, empirical regularities (constant conjunctions of events), changes in conditional probabilities, counterfactual conditions, mechanisms underlying causal relations, and invariance under intervention.\n\n====Geometrical significance====\nCausality has the properties of antecedence and contiguity.<ref name=\"Born\"/><ref name=\"Sklar\"/> These are topological, and are ingredients for space-time geometry. As developed by [[Alfred Robb]], these properties allow the derivation of the notions of time and space.<ref>[[Alfred Robb|Robb, A.A.]] (1936). [https://archive.org/details/geometryoftimean032218mbp ''Geometry of Time and Space''], Cambridge University Press, Cambridge UK.</ref> [[Max Jammer]] writes \"the Einstein postulate ... opens the way to a straightforward construction of the causal topology ... of Minkowski space.\"<ref>[[Max Jammer|Jammer, M.]] (1982).

In practical terms, this is because use of the relation of causality is necessary for the interpretation of empirical experiments. Interpretation of experiments is needed to establish the physical and geometrical notions of time and space.\n\n====Volition====\nThe [[determinism|deterministic]] world-view holds that the history of the [[universe]] can be exhaustively represented as a [[chain of events|progression of events]] following one after as cause and effect.<ref name=\"Sklar\">Sklar, L.

In general, a factor that is a contributory cause is not sufficient, because it is by definition accompanied by other causes, which would not count as causes if it were sufficient.

L. Mackie]] argues that usual talk of \"cause\" in fact refers to '''INUS''' conditions ('''i'''nsufficient but '''n'''on-redundant parts of a condition which is itself '''u'''nnecessary but '''s'''ufficient for the occurrence of the effect).<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h38IAQAAIAAJ|title=The Cement of the Universe: A Study of Causation|last=Mackie|first=John Leslie|date=1974|publisher=Clarendon Press|language=en}}</ref> An example is a short circuit as a cause for a house burning down. Consider the collection of events: the short circuit, the proximity of flammable material, and the absence of firefighters. Together these are unnecessary but sufficient to the house's burning down (since many other collections of events certainly could have led to the house burning down, for example shooting the house with a flamethrower in the presence of oxygen and so forth). Within this collection, the short circuit is an insufficient (since the short circuit by itself would not have caused the fire) but non-redundant (because the fire would not have happened without it, everything else being equal) part of a condition which is itself unnecessary but sufficient for the occurrence of the effect. So, the short circuit is an INUS condition for the occurrence of the house burning down.\n\n===Contrasted with conditionals===\n{{more citations needed|section|reason=Want to read more, want to examine source|date=January 2017}} \n[[Indicative conditional|Conditional]] statements are ''not'' statements of causality. An important distinction is that statements of causality require the antecedent to precede or coincide with the consequent in time, whereas conditional statements do not require this temporal order. Confusion commonly arises since many different statements in English may be presented using \"If ..., then ...\" form (and, arguably, because this form is far more commonly used to make a statement of causality). The two types of statements are distinct, however.\n\nFor example, all of the following statements are true when interpreting \"If ..., then ...\" as the material conditional:\n\n# ''If Barack Obama is president of the United States in 2011, then Germany is in Europe.''\n# ''If George Washington is president of the United States in 2011, then <arbitrary statement>.''\n\nThe first is true since both the [[Antecedent (logic)|antecedent]] and the [[consequent]] are true. The second is true in [[sentential logic]] and indeterminate in natural language, regardless of the consequent statement that follows, because the antecedent is false.\n\nThe ordinary [[indicative conditional]] has somewhat more structure than the material conditional. For instance, although the first is the closest, neither of the preceding two statements seems true as an ordinary indicative reading. But the sentence:\n\n* ''If Shakespeare of Stratford-on-Avon did not write Macbeth, then someone else did.''\nintuitively seems to be true, even though there is no straightforward causal relation in this hypothetical situation between Shakespeare's not writing Macbeth and someone else's actually writing it.\n\nAnother sort of conditional, the [[counterfactual conditional]], has a stronger connection with causality, yet even counterfactual statements are not all examples of causality. Consider the following two statements:\n\n# ''If A were a triangle, then A would have three sides.''\n# ''If switch S were thrown, then bulb B would light.''\n\nIn the first case, it would not be correct to say that A's being a triangle ''caused'' it to have three sides, since the relationship between triangularity and three-sidedness is that of definition. The property of having three sides actually determines A's state as a triangle. Nonetheless, even when interpreted counterfactually, the first statement is true. An early version of Aristotle's \"four cause\" theory is described as recognizing \"essential cause\". In this version of the theory, that the closed polygon has three sides is said to be the \"essential cause\" of its being a triangle.<ref name=\"Graham 1987\"/> This use of the word 'cause' is of course now far obsolete. Nevertheless, it is within the scope of ordinary language to say that it is essential to a triangle that it has three sides.\n\nA full grasp of the concept of conditionals is important to [[understanding]] the literature on causality. In everyday language, loose conditional statements are often enough made, and need to be interpreted carefully.\n\n===Questionable cause===\n{{Main|Questionable cause}}\n\nFallacies of questionable cause, also known as causal fallacies, ''non-causa pro causa'' (Latin for \"non-cause for cause\"), or false cause, are [[informal fallacy|informal fallacies]] where a cause is incorrectly identified.\n\n==Theories==\n{{Main|Causal model}}\n\n===Counterfactual theories===\n{{Main|Counterfactual conditional}}\n\nSubjunctive conditionals are familiar from ordinary language. They are of the form, if A ''were'' the case, then B ''would'' be the case, or if A ''had been'' the case, then B ''would have been'' the case. Counterfactual conditionals are specifically subjunctive conditionals whose antecedents are in fact false, hence the name. However the term used technically may apply to conditionals with true antecedents as well.\n\nPsychological research shows that people's thoughts about the causal relationships between events influences their judgments of the plausibility of counterfactual alternatives, and conversely, their [[counterfactual thinking]] about how a situation could have turned out differently changes their judgments of the causal role of events and agents. Nonetheless, their identification of the cause of an event, and their counterfactual thought about how the event could have turned out differently do not always coincide.<ref>Byrne, R.M.J. (2005).

Doctoral dissertation, Queen Mary University of London.</ref> for example.\n\nIn the philosophical literature, the suggestion that causation is to be defined in terms of a counterfactual relation is made by the 18th-century Scottish philosopher [[David Hume]]. Hume remarks that we may define the relation of cause and effect such that \"where, if the first object had not been, the second never had existed.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hume|first1=David|title=An Enquiry concerning Human Understanding|date=1748|location=Sec. VII}}</ref>\n\nMore full-fledged analysis of causation in terms of counterfactual conditionals only came in the 20th century after development of the possible world semantics for the evaluation of counterfactual conditionals. In his 1973 paper \"Causation,\" [[David Lewis (philosopher)|David Lewis]] proposed the following definition of the notion of ''causal dependence'':<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lewis|first1=David|title=Causation|journal=The Journal of Philosophy|date=1973|volume=70|issue=17}}</ref>\n\n:An event E ''causally depends'' on C if, and only if, (i) if C had occurred, then E would have occurred, and (ii) if C had not occurred, then E would not have occurred.\n\nCausation is then defined as a chain of causal dependence. That is, C causes E if and only if there exists a sequence of events C, D<sub>1</sub>, D<sub>2</sub>, ... D<sub>k</sub>, E such that each event in the sequence depends on the previous. The word 'mechanism' may be used to refer to such a chain.\n\nNote that the analysis does not purport to explain how we make causal judgements or how we reason about causation, but rather to give a metaphysical account of what it is for there to be a causal relation between some pair of events. If correct, the analysis has the power to explain certain features of causation. Knowing that causation is a matter of counterfactual dependence, we may reflect on the nature of counterfactual dependence to account for the nature of causation. For example, in his paper \"Counterfactual Dependence and Time's Arrow,\" Lewis sought to account for the time-directedness of counterfactual dependence in terms of the semantics of the counterfactual conditional.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lewis|first1=David|title=Counterfactual Dependence and Time's Arrow|journal=Nous|date=1979|volume=13|issue=4}}</ref> If correct, this theory can serve to explain a fundamental part of our experience, which is that we can only causally affect the future but not the past.\n\n===Probabilistic causation===\n{{Main|Probabilistic causation}}\nInterpreting causation as a [[Determinism|deterministic]] relation means that if ''A'' causes ''B'', then ''A'' must ''always'' be followed by ''B''. In this sense, war does not cause deaths, nor does [[Tobacco smoking|smoking]] cause [[cancer]] or [[emphysema]]. As a result, many turn to a notion of probabilistic causation. Informally, ''A'' (\"The person is a smoker\") probabilistically causes ''B'' (\"The person has now or will have cancer at some time in the future\"), if the information that ''A'' occurred increases the likelihood of ''B''s occurrence. Formally, P{''B''|''A''}\u2265 P{''B''} where P{''B''|''A''} is the conditional probability that ''B'' will occur given the information that ''A'' occurred, and P{''B''}is the probability that ''B'' will occur having no knowledge whether ''A'' did or did not occur. This intuitive condition is not adequate as a definition for probabilistic causation because of its being too general and thus not meeting our intuitive notion of cause and effect.  For example, if ''A'' denotes the event \"The person is a smoker,\" ''B'' denotes the event \"The person now has or will have cancer at some time in the future\" and ''C'' denotes the event \"The person now has or will have emphysema some time in the future,\" then the following three relationships hold: P{''B''|''A''} \u2265 P{''B''}, P{''C''|''A''} \u2265 P{''C''} and P{''B''|''C''} \u2265 P{''B''}.  The last relationship states that knowing that the person has emphysema increases the likelihood that he will have cancer.  The reason for this is that having the information that the person has emphysema increases the likelihood that the person is a smoker, thus indirectly increasing the likelihood that the person will have cancer.  However, we would not want to conclude that having emphysema causes cancer. Thus, we need additional conditions such as temporal relationship of ''A'' to ''B'' and a rational explanation as to the mechanism of action. It is hard to quantify this last requirement and thus different authors prefer somewhat different definitions.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\n===Causal calculus===\nWhen experimental interventions are infeasible or illegal, the derivation of cause effect relationship from observational studies must rest on some qualitative theoretical assumptions, for example, that symptoms do not cause diseases, usually expressed in the form of missing arrows in [[causal graphs]] such as [[Bayesian network]]s or [[path analysis (statistics)|path diagrams]]. The theory underlying these derivations relies on the distinction between ''conditional probabilities'', as in <math>P(cancer|smoking)</math>, and ''interventional probabilities'', as in <math>P(cancer|do(smoking))</math>. The former reads: \"the probability of finding cancer in a person known to smoke, having started, unforced by the experimenter, to do so at an unspecified time in the past\", while the latter reads: \"the probability of finding cancer in a person forced by the experimenter to smoke at a specified time in the past\". The former is a statistical notion that can be estimated by observation with negligible intervention by the experimenter, while the latter is a causal notion which is estimated in an experiment with an important controlled randomized intervention. It is specifically characteristic of [[quantum mechanics|quantal phenomena]] that observations defined by incompatible variables always involve important intervention by the experimenter, as described quantitatively by the [[Observer effect (physics)|observer effect]].{{Vague|date=June 2016}} In classical [[thermodynamics]], [[thermodynamic process|processes]] are initiated by interventions called [[thermodynamic operation]]s. In other branches of science, for example [[astronomy]], the experimenter can often observe with negligible intervention.\n\nThe theory of \"causal calculus\"<ref name=Pearl>Pearl, Judea (2000). ''[https://www.google.com/books/edition/_/wnGU_TsW3BQC?hl=en&gbpv=1 Causality: Models, Reasoning, and Inference]'', Cambridge University Press.</ref> (also known as do-calculus, [[Judea Pearl]]'s Causal Calculus, Calculus of\nActions) permits one to infer interventional probabilities from conditional probabilities in causal [[Bayesian network]]s with unmeasured variables. One very practical result of this theory is the characterization of [[confounding variables]], namely, a sufficient set of variables that, if adjusted for, would yield the correct causal effect between variables of interest. It can be shown that a sufficient set for estimating the causal effect of <math>X</math> on <math>Y</math> is any set of non-descendants of <math>X</math> that <math>d</math>-separate <math>X</math> from <math>Y</math> after removing all arrows emanating from <math>X</math>. This criterion, called \"backdoor\", provides a mathematical definition of \"confounding\" and helps researchers identify accessible sets of variables worthy of measurement.\n\n===Structure learning===\nWhile derivations in causal calculus rely on the structure of the causal graph, parts of the causal structure can, under certain assumptions, be learned from statistical data. The basic idea goes back to [[Sewall Wright]]'s 1921 work<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Wright | first1 = S | year = | title = Correlation and Causation | url = | journal = Journal of Agricultural Research | volume = 20 | issue = 7| pages = 557\u2013585 }}</ref> on [[Path analysis (statistics)|path analysis]]. A \"recovery\" algorithm was developed by Rebane and Pearl (1987)<ref>Rebane, G. and Pearl, J., \"[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1304.2736 The Recovery of Causal Poly-trees from Statistical Data]\", ''Proceedings, 3rd Workshop on Uncertainty in AI'', (Seattle) pp. 222\u2013228, 1987</ref> which rests on Wright's distinction between the three possible types of causal substructures allowed in a [[directed acyclic graph]] (DAG):\n\n# <math>X \\rightarrow Y \\rightarrow Z</math>\n# <math>X \\leftarrow Y \\rightarrow Z</math>\n# <math>X \\rightarrow Y \\leftarrow Z</math>\n\nType 1 and type 2 represent the same statistical dependencies (i.e., <math>X</math> and <math>Z</math> are independent given <math>Y</math>) and are, therefore, indistinguishable within purely [[cross-sectional data]]. Type 3, however, can be uniquely identified, since <math>X</math> and <math>Z</math> are marginally independent and all other pairs are dependent. Thus, while the ''skeletons'' (the graphs stripped of arrows) of these three triplets are identical, the directionality of the arrows is partially identifiable. The same distinction applies when <math>X</math> and <math>Z</math> have common ancestors, except that one must first condition on those ancestors. Algorithms have been developed to systematically determine the skeleton of the underlying graph and, then, orient all arrows whose directionality is dictated by the conditional independencies observed.<ref name=\"Pearl\" /><ref>Spirites, P. and Glymour, C., \"An algorithm for fast recovery of sparse causal graphs\", ''Social Science Computer Review'', Vol. 9, pp. 62\u201372, 1991.</ref><ref>Spirtes, P. and Glymour, C. and Scheines, R., ''Causation, Prediction, and Search'', New York: Springer-Verlag, 1993</ref><ref>Verma, T. and Pearl, J., \"[http://ftp.cs.ucla.edu/pub/stat_ser/R150.pdf Equivalence and Synthesis of Causal Models]\", ''Proceedings of the Sixth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence'', (July, Cambridge, Massachusetts), pp. 220\u2013227, 1990.

Kanal and J.F.\\ Lemmer (Eds.), ''Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence 6'', Amsterdam: Elsevier Science Publishers, B.V., pp. 225\u2013268, 1991</ref>\n\nAlternative methods of structure learning search through the ''many'' possible causal structures among the variables, and remove ones which are strongly incompatible with the observed [[correlation]]s. In general this leaves a set of possible causal relations, which should then be tested by analyzing time series data or, preferably, designing appropriately controlled [[experiment]]s. In contrast with Bayesian Networks, [[path analysis (statistics)|path analysis]] (and its generalization, [[structural equation model]]ing), serve better to estimate a known causal effect or to test a causal model than to generate causal hypotheses.\n\nFor nonexperimental data, causal direction can often be inferred if information about time is available. This is because (according to many, though not all, theories) causes must precede their effects temporally. This can be determined by statistical [[time series]] models, for instance, or with a statistical test based on the idea of [[Granger causality]], or by direct experimental manipulation. The use of temporal data can permit statistical tests of a pre-existing theory of causal direction. For instance, our degree of confidence in the direction and nature of causality is much greater when supported by [[cross-correlation]]s, [[ARIMA]] models, or [[Cross-spectrum|cross-spectral analysis]] using vector time series data than by [[cross-sectional data]].\n\n===Derivation theories===\nNobel Prize laureate [[Herbert A. Simon]] and philosopher [[Nicholas Rescher]]<ref name=\"SimRes\">{{cite journal | last1 = Simon | first1 = Herbert | last2 = Rescher | first2 = Nicholas | year = 1966 | title = Cause and Counterfactual | url = | journal = Philosophy of Science | volume = 33 | issue = 4| pages = 323\u2013340 | doi=10.1086/288105}}</ref> claim that the asymmetry of the causal relation is unrelated to the asymmetry of any mode of implication that contraposes. Rather, a causal relation is not a relation between values of variables, but a function of one variable (the cause) on to another (the effect). So, given a system of equations, and a set of variables appearing in these equations, we can introduce an asymmetric relation among individual equations and variables that corresponds perfectly to our commonsense notion of a causal ordering. The system of equations must have certain properties, most importantly, if some values are chosen arbitrarily, the remaining values will be determined uniquely through a path of serial discovery that is perfectly causal. They postulate the inherent serialization of such a system of equations may correctly capture causation in all empirical fields, including physics and economics.\n\n===Manipulation theories===\nSome theorists have equated causality with manipulability.<ref name=\"Collingwood\">Collingwood, R. (1940) ''An Essay on Metaphysics.''

(1971) ''Explanation and Understanding.'' [[Cornell University Press]].</ref> Under these theories, ''x'' causes ''y'' only in the case that one can change ''x'' in order to change ''y''. This coincides with commonsense notions of causations, since often we ask causal questions in order to change some feature of the world. For instance, we are interested in knowing the causes of crime so that we might find ways of reducing it.\n\nThese theories have been criticized on two primary grounds. First, theorists complain that these accounts are [[Begging the question|circular]]. Attempting to reduce causal claims to manipulation requires that manipulation is more basic than causal interaction. But describing manipulations in non-causal terms has provided a substantial difficulty.\n\nThe second criticism centers around concerns of [[anthropocentrism]]. It seems to many people that causality is some existing relationship in the world that we can harness for our desires. If causality is identified with our manipulation, then this intuition is lost. In this sense, it makes humans overly central to interactions in the world.\n\nSome attempts to defend manipulability theories are recent accounts that don't claim to reduce causality to manipulation. These accounts use manipulation as a sign or feature in causation without claiming that manipulation is more fundamental than causation.<ref name=\"Pearl\" /><!-- Pearl, Judea (2000) ''Causality'', Cambridge University Press, ISBN 0-521-77362-8</ref> --><ref name=\"Woodward\">Woodward, James (2003) ''Making Things Happen: A Theory of Causal Explanation''. [[Oxford University Press]], {{ISBN|0-19-515527-0}}</ref>\n\n===Process theories===\nSome theorists are interested in distinguishing between causal processes and non-causal processes (Russell 1948; Salmon 1984).<ref name=\"Salmon\">Salmon, W.

Princeton University Press.</ref><ref name=\"Russell\">Russell, B. (1948) ''Human Knowledge''. Simon and Schuster.</ref> These theorists often want to distinguish between a process and a [[pseudo-process]]. As an example, a ball moving through the air (a process) is contrasted with the motion of a shadow (a pseudo-process). The former is causal in nature while the latter is not.\n\nSalmon (1984)<ref name=\"Salmon\" /> claims that causal processes can be identified by their ability to transmit an alteration over space and time. An alteration of the ball (a mark by a pen, perhaps) is carried with it as the ball goes through the air. On the other hand, an alteration of the shadow (insofar as it is possible) will not be transmitted by the shadow as it moves along.\n\nThese theorists claim that the important concept for understanding causality is not causal relationships or causal interactions, but rather identifying causal processes. The former notions can then be defined in terms of causal processes.\n\n[[File:Herald of Free Enterprise WBG.png|thumb|600px|center|[[Why-Because analysis|Why-Because]] Graph of the capsizing of the [[Herald of Free Enterprise]] (click to see in detail).]]A subgroup of the process theories is the mechanistic view on causality.

To establish causality, the experiment must fulfill certain criteria, only one example of which is mentioned here. For example, instances of the hypothesized cause must be set up to occur at a time when the hypothesized effect is relatively unlikely in the absence of the hypothesized cause; such unlikelihood is to be established by empirical evidence. A mere observation of a [[correlation does not imply causation|correlation]] is not nearly adequate to establish causality. In nearly all cases, establishment of causality relies on repetition of experiments and probabilistic reasoning. Hardly ever is causality established more firmly than as more or less probable. It is most convenient for establishment of causality if the contrasting material states of affairs are precisely matched, except for only one variable factor, perhaps measured by a real number.\n\n====Physics====\n{{Main|Causality (physics)}}\n\nOne has to be careful in the use of the word cause in physics. Properly speaking, the hypothesized cause and the hypothesized effect are each temporally transient processes. For example, force is a useful concept for the explanation of acceleration, but force is not by itself a cause. More is needed. For example, a temporally transient process might be characterized by a definite change of force at a definite time. Such a process can be regarded as a cause. Causality is not inherently implied in [[equations of motion]], but postulated as an additional [[constraint (classical mechanics)|constraint]] that needs to be satisfied (i.e. a cause always precedes its effect). This constraint has mathematical implications<ref name=kinsler2011>\n{{cite journal\n| author=Kinsler, P.\n| year=2011\n| title=How to be causal\n| journal=Eur. J.

Otherwise, reference coordinate systems could be constructed (using the [[Lorentz transform]] of [[special relativity]]) in which an observer would see an effect precede its cause (i.e. the postulate of causality would be violated).\n\nCausal notions appear in the context of the flow of mass-energy. Any actual process has causal efficacy that can propagate no faster than light. In contrast, an abstraction has no causal efficacy. Its mathematical expression does not propagate in the ordinary sense of the word, though it may refer to virtual or nominal 'velocities' with magnitudes greater than that of light. For example, wave packets are mathematical objects that have [[group velocity]] and [[phase velocity]]. The energy of a wave packet travels at the group velocity (under normal circumstances); since energy has causal efficacy, the group velocity cannot be faster than the speed of light. The phase of a wave packet travels at the phase velocity; since phase is not causal, the phase velocity of a wave packet can be faster than light.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Griffiths |first1=David |title=Introduction to electrodynamics |date=2017 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1-108-42041-9 |page=418 |edition=Fourth}}</ref>\n\nCausal notions are important in general relativity to the extent that the existence of an arrow of time demands that the universe's semi-Riemannian manifold be orientable, so that \"future\" and \"past\" are globally definable quantities.\n\n====Engineering====\nA [[causal system]] is a [[system]] with output and internal states that depends only on the current and previous input values. A system that has ''some'' dependence on input values from the future (in addition to possible past or current input values) is termed an '''acausal''' system, and a system that depends ''solely'' on future input values is an [[anticausal system]]. Acausal filters, for example, can only exist as postprocessing filters, because these filters can extract future values from a memory buffer or a file.\n\n====Biology, medicine and epidemiology====\n[[Austin Bradford Hill]] built upon the work of [[David Hume|Hume]] and [[Karl Popper|Popper]] and suggested in his paper \"The Environment and Disease: Association or Causation?\" that aspects of an association such as strength, consistency, specificity and temporality be considered in attempting to distinguish causal from noncausal associations in the epidemiological situation. (See [[Bradford-Hill criteria]].) He did not note however, that temporality is the only necessary criterion among those aspects. Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) are increasingly used in epidemiology to help enlighten causal thinking.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Chiolero|first=A|author2=Paradis, G |author3=Kaufman, JS |title=Assessing the possible direct effect of birth weight on childhood blood pressure: a sensitivity analysis|journal=American Journal of Epidemiology|date=1 January 2014|volume=179|issue=1|pages=4\u201311|pmid=24186972|doi=10.1093/aje/kwt228|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\n====Psychology====\n{{Main|Causal reasoning}}\nPsychologists take an empirical approach to causality, investigating how people and non-human animals detect or infer causation from sensory information, prior experience and [[innatism|innate knowledge]].\n\n;Attribution\n[[Attribution theory]] is the [[theory]] concerning how people explain individual occurrences of causation. [[Attribution (psychology)|Attribution]] can be external (assigning causality to an outside agent or force\u2014claiming that some outside thing motivated the event) or internal (assigning causality to factors within the person\u2014taking personal [[Moral responsibility|responsibility]] or [[accountability]] for one's actions and claiming that the person was directly responsible for the event). Taking causation one step further, the type of attribution a person provides influences their future behavior.\n\nThe intention behind the cause or the effect can be covered by the subject of [[action (philosophy)|action]]. See also [[accident]]; [[blame]]; [[intent (law)|intent]]; and responsibility.\n\n;Causal powers\nWhereas [[David Hume#Causation|David Hume]] argued that causes are inferred from non-causal observations, [[Immanuel Kant]] claimed that people have innate assumptions about causes. Within psychology, [[Patricia Cheng]]<ref name=\"Cheng1997\"/> attempted to reconcile the Humean and Kantian views. According to her power PC theory, people filter observations of events through an intuition that causes have the power to generate (or prevent) their effects, thereby inferring specific cause-effect relations.\n\n;Causation and salience\nOur view of causation depends on what we consider to be the relevant events. Another way to view the statement, \"Lightning causes thunder\" is to see both lightning and thunder as two perceptions of the same event, viz., an electric discharge that we perceive first visually and then aurally.\n\n;Naming and causality\nDavid Sobel and Alison Gopnik from the Psychology Department of UC Berkeley designed a device known as ''the blicket detector'' which would turn on when an object was placed on it. Their research suggests that \"even young children will easily and swiftly learn about a new causal power of an object and spontaneously use that information in classifying and naming the object.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Gopnik |first1=A |first2=David M. |last2=Sobel |title=Detecting Blickets: How Young Children Use Information about Novel Causal Powers in Categorization and Induction |journal=Child Development |date=September\u2013October 2000 |volume=71 |issue=5 |pages=1205\u20131222 |doi=10.1111/1467-8624.00224 |pmid=11108092}}</ref>\n\n;Perception of launching events\nSome researchers such as Anjan Chatterjee at the University of Pennsylvania and Jonathan Fugelsang at the University of Waterloo are using neuroscience techniques to investigate the neural and psychological underpinnings of causal launching events in which one object causes another object to move.

The body of statistical techniques involves substantial use of [[regression analysis]]. Typically a linear relationship such as\n\n:<math>y_i = a_0 + a_1x_{1,i} + a_2x_{2,i} + ... + a_kx_{k,i} + e_i</math>\n\nis postulated, in which <math>y_i</math> is the ''i''th observation of the dependent variable (hypothesized to be the caused variable), <math>x_{j,i}</math> for ''j''=1,...,''k'' is the ''i''th observation on the ''j''th independent variable (hypothesized to be a causative variable), and <math>e_i</math> is the error term for the ''i''th observation (containing the combined effects of all other causative variables, which must be uncorrelated with the included independent variables). If there is reason to believe that none of the <math>x_j</math>s is caused by ''y'', then estimates of the coefficients <math>a_j</math> are obtained. If the null hypothesis that <math>a_j=0</math> is rejected, then the alternative hypothesis that <math>a_{j} \\ne 0 </math> and equivalently that <math>x_j</math> causes ''y'' cannot be rejected. On the other hand, if the null hypothesis that <math>a_j=0</math> cannot be rejected, then equivalently the hypothesis of no causal effect of <math>x_j</math> on ''y'' cannot be rejected. Here the notion of causality is one of contributory causality as discussed [[Causality#Necessary and sufficient causes|above]]: If the true value <math>a_j \\ne 0</math>, then a change in <math>x_j</math> will result in a change in ''y'' ''unless'' some other causative variable(s), either included in the regression or implicit in the error term, change in such a way as to exactly offset its effect; thus a change in <math>x_j</math> is ''not sufficient'' to change ''y''. Likewise, a change in <math>x_j</math> is ''not necessary'' to change ''y'', because a change in ''y'' could be caused by something implicit in the error term (or by some other causative explanatory variable included in the model).\n\nThe above way of testing for causality requires belief that there is no reverse causation, in which ''y'' would cause <math>x_j</math>. This belief can be established in one of several ways. First, the variable <math>x_j</math> may be a non-economic variable: for example, if rainfall amount <math>x_j</math> is hypothesized to affect the futures price ''y'' of some agricultural commodity, it is impossible that in fact the futures price affects rainfall amount (provided that cloud seeding is never attempted). Second, the [[instrumental variables]] technique may be employed to remove any reverse causation by introducing a role for other variables (instruments) that are known to be unaffected by the dependent variable. Third, the principle that effects cannot precede causes can be invoked, by including on the right side of the regression only variables that precede in time the dependent variable; this principle is invoked, for example, in testing for [[Granger causality]] and in its multivariate analog, [[vector autoregression]], both of which control for lagged values of the dependent variable while testing for causal effects of lagged independent variables.\n\nRegression analysis controls for other relevant variables by including them as regressors (explanatory variables). This helps to avoid false inferences of causality due to the presence of a third, underlying, variable that influences both the potentially causative variable and the potentially caused variable: its effect on the potentially caused variable is captured by directly including it in the regression, so that effect will not be picked up as an indirect effect through the potentially causative variable of interest. Given the above procedures, coincidental (as opposed to causal) correlation can be probabilistically rejected if data samples are large and if regression results pass [[Cross-validation (statistics)|cross-validation]] tests showing that the correlations hold even for data that were not used in the regression.However, asserting with certitude that a common-cause is absent and the regression represents the true causal structure is ''in principle'' impossible<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Henschen|first=Tobias|date=2018|title=The in-principle inconclusiveness of causal evidence in macroeconomics|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13194-018-0207-7|journal=European Journal for the Philosophy of Science|volume=8(3)|pages=709-733|via=}}</ref>.\n\nApart from constructing statistical models of observational and experimental data, economists use axiomatic (mathematical) models to infer and represent causal mechanisms. Highly abstract theoretical models that isolate and idealize one mechanism dominate microeconomics. In macroeconomics, economists use broad mathematical models that are calibrated on historical data.

The diagram categorizes causes, such as into the six main categories shown here. These categories are then sub-divided. Ishikawa's method identifies \"causes\" in brainstorming sessions conducted among various groups involved in the manufacturing process. These groups can then be labeled as categories in the diagrams. The use of these diagrams has now spread beyond quality control, and they are used in other areas of management and in design and engineering. Ishikawa diagrams have been criticized for failing to make the distinction between necessary conditions and sufficient conditions. It seems that Ishikawa was not even aware of this distinction.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Gregory | first1 = Frank Hutson | year = 1992 | title = Cause, Effect, Efficiency & Soft Systems Models, Warwick Business School Research Paper No. 42 |issn=0160-5682 | url = | journal = Journal of the Operational Research Society | volume = 44 | issue = 4| pages = 333\u2013344 | doi=10.1057/jors.1993.63| title-link = s:Cause, Effect, Efficiency & Soft Systems Models }}</ref>\n\n===Humanities===\n\n====History====\nIn the discussion of history, events are sometimes considered as if in some way being agents that can then bring about other historical events.

It has four intricate causal conditioning constructions with the: 1) root cause, 2) immediate antecedent, 3) object support, and 4) predominance. Then, the six causes are: 1) instrumentality (k\u0101ra\u1e47ahetu), deemed the primary factor in result production; 2) simultaneity or coexistence, which connects phenomena that arise simultaneously; 3) homogeneity, explaining the homogenous flow that evokes phenomena continuity; 4) association, which operates only between mental factors and explains why consciousness appears as assemblages to mental factors; 5) dominance, which forms one's habitual cognitive and behaviorist dispositions; and 6) fruition, referring to whatever is the actively wholesome or unwholesome result. The four conditions and six causes interact with each other in explaining phenomenal experience: for instance, each conscious moment acts both as the homogenous cause, as well as the immediate antecedent consciousness condition rise, and its concomitants, in a subsequent moment.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\nThe [[Vaibhashika]] (c. 500 CE) is an [[early buddhist school]] which favors direct object contact and accepts simultaneous cause and effects.

Here Aristotle insists that all four modes of explanation are called for in the study of natural phenomena, and that the job of \"the student of nature is to bring the why-question back to them all in the way appropriate to the science of nature\" (''Phys.'' 198 a 21\u201323). The best way to understand this methodological recommendation is the following: the science of nature is concerned with natural bodies insofar as they are subject to change, and the job of the student of nature is to provide the explanation of their natural change. The factors that are involved in the explanation of natural change turn out to be matter, form, that which produces the change, and the end of this change. Note that Aristotle does not say that all four explanatory factors are involved in the explanation of each and every instance of natural change. Rather, he says that an adequate explanation of natural change may involve a reference to all of them. Aristotle goes on by adding a specification on his doctrine of the four causes: the form and the end often coincide, and they are formally the same as that which produces the change (''Phys.'' 198 a 23\u201326).}}</ref>\n* [[Efficient cause]], which imparts the first relevant ''movement'', as a human lifts a rock or raises a statue. This is the main topic of the present article.\n* [[Final cause]], the criterion of completion, or the [[Telos (philosophy)|end]]; it may refer to an action or to an inanimate process. Examples: Socrates takes a walk after dinner for the sake of his health; earth falls to the lowest level because that is its nature.\n\nOf Aristotle's four kinds or explanatory modes, only one, the 'efficient cause' is a cause as defined in the leading paragraph of this present article. The other three explanatory modes might be rendered material composition, structure and dynamics, and, again, criterion of completion. The word that Aristotle used was {{math|\u03b1\u1f30\u03c4\u03af\u03b1}}. For the present purpose, that Greek word would be better translated as \"explanation\" than as \"cause\" as those words are most often used in current English. Another translation of Aristotle is that he meant \"the four Becauses\" as four kinds of answer to \"why\" questions.<ref name=\"Graham 1987\"/>\n\nAristotle assumed efficient causality as referring to a basic fact of experience, not explicable by, or reducible to, anything more fundamental or basic.\n\nIn some works of Aristotle, the four causes are listed as (1) the essential cause, (2) the logical ground, (3) the moving cause, and (4) the final cause. In this listing, a statement of essential cause is a demonstration that an indicated object conforms to a definition of the word that refers to it. A statement of logical ground is an argument as to why an object statement is true. These are further examples of the idea that a \"cause\" in general in the context of Aristotle's usage is an \"explanation\".<ref name=\"Graham 1987\"/>\n\nThe word \"efficient\" used here can also be translated from Aristotle as \"moving\" or \"initiating\".<ref name=\"Graham 1987\"/>\n\nEfficient causation was connected with [[Aristotelian physics]], which recognized the [[four classical elements|four elements]] (earth, air, fire, water), and added the [[Aether (classical element)|fifth element]] (aether). Water and earth by their intrinsic property ''gravitas'' or heaviness intrinsically fall toward, whereas air and fire by their intrinsic property ''levitas'' or lightness intrinsically rise away from, Earth's center\u2014the motionless center of the universe\u2014in a straight line while accelerating during the substance's approach to its natural place.\n\nAs air remained on Earth, however, and did not escape Earth while eventually achieving infinite speed\u2014an absurdity\u2014Aristotle inferred that the universe is finite in size and contains an invisible substance that held planet Earth and its atmosphere, the [[sublunary sphere]], centered in the universe. And since celestial bodies exhibit perpetual, unaccelerated motion orbiting planet Earth in unchanging relations, Aristotle inferred that the fifth element, ''aither'', that fills space and composes celestial bodies intrinsically moves in perpetual circles, the only constant motion between two points. (An object traveling a straight line from point ''A'' to ''B'' and back must stop at either point before returning to the other.)\n\nLeft to itself, a thing exhibits ''natural motion'', but can\u2014according to [[Aristotelian metaphysics]]\u2014exhibit ''enforced motion'' imparted by an efficient cause. The form of plants endows plants with the processes nutrition and reproduction, the form of animals adds locomotion, and the form of humankind adds reason atop these. A rock normally exhibits ''natural motion''\u2014explained by the rock's material cause of being composed of the element earth\u2014but a living thing can lift the rock, an ''enforced motion'' diverting the rock from its natural place and natural motion. As a further kind of explanation, Aristotle identified the final cause, specifying a purpose or criterion of completion in light of which something should be understood.\n\nAristotle himself explained,\n\n{{Quotation|''Cause'' means\n\n(a) in one sense, that as the result of whose presence something comes into being\u2014e.g., the bronze of a statue and the silver of a cup, and the classes which contain these [i.e., the '''material cause'''];\n\n(b) in another sense, the form or pattern; that is, the essential formula and the classes which contain it\u2014e.g. the ratio 2:1 and number in general is the cause of the octave\u2014and the parts of the formula [i.e., the '''formal cause'''].\n\n(c) The source of the first beginning of change or rest; e.g. the man who plans is a cause, and the father is the cause of the child, and in general that which produces is the cause of that which is produced, and that which changes of that which is changed [i.e., the '''efficient cause'''].\n\n(d) The same as \"end\"; i.e. the final cause; e.g., as the \"end\" of walking is health. For why does a man walk? \"To be healthy\", we say, and by saying this we consider that we have supplied the cause [the '''final cause'''].\n\n(e) All those means towards the end which arise at the instigation of something else, as, e.g., fat-reducing, purging, drugs and instruments are causes of health; for they all have the end as their object, although they differ from each other as being some instruments, others actions [i.e., necessary conditions].|Metaphysics, Book 5, section 1013a, translated by Hugh Tredennick<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0052%3Abook%3D5%3Asection%3D1013a Aristotle.

Cambridge, MA, Harvard University Press; London, William Heinemann Ltd. 1933, 1989.] (hosted at perseus.tufts.edu.)</ref>}}\n\nAristotle further discerned two modes of causation: proper (prior) causation and accidental (chance) causation. All causes, proper and accidental, can be spoken as potential or as actual, particular or generic. The same language refers to the effects of causes, so that generic effects are assigned to generic causes, particular effects to particular causes, and actual effects to operating causes.\n\nAverting [[infinite regress]], Aristotle inferred the first mover\u2014an [[unmoved mover]]. The first mover's motion, too, must have been caused, but, being an unmoved mover, must have moved only toward a particular goal or desire.\n\n====Middle Ages====\nIn line with Aristotelian cosmology, [[Thomas Aquinas]] posed a hierarchy prioritizing Aristotle's four causes: \"final > efficient > material > formal\".<ref name=\"The Thomist article\">{{cite journal|journal=The Thomist|author=William E.

Later in the Middle Ages, many scholars conceded that the first cause was God, but explained that many earthly events occur within God's design or plan, and thereby scholars sought freedom to investigate the numerous ''secondary causes''.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=O\u2019Meara |first1=T.F. |title=The dignity of being a cause |journal=Open Theology |date=2018 |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=186\u2013191 |doi=10.1515/opth-2018-0013|doi-access=free }}</ref>\n\n====After the Middle Ages====\n<!--[[David Hume]] links here-->\n{{See also|Humean definition of causality}}\nFor Aristotelian philosophy before Aquinas, the word cause had a broad meaning. It meant 'answer to a why question' or 'explanation', and Aristotelian scholars recognized four kinds of such answers. With the end of the [[Middle Ages]], in many philosophical usages, the meaning of the word 'cause' narrowed. It often lost that broad meaning, and was restricted to just one of the four kinds. For authors such as [[Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli]], in the field of political thinking, and [[Francis Bacon]], concerning [[science]] more generally, Aristotle's moving cause was the focus of their interest. A widely used modern definition of causality in this newly narrowed sense was assumed by [[David Hume]].<ref name=\"The Thomist article\"/> He undertook an epistemological and metaphysical investigation of the notion of moving cause. He denied that we can ever perceive cause and effect, except by developing a habit or custom of mind where we come to associate two types of object or event, always contiguous and occurring one after the other.<ref>{{Citation|first=David|last=Hume|title= A Treatise of Human Nature|origyear=1739|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/4705/4705-h/4705-h.htm|editor-last=Selby-Bigge|publisher=Clarendon Press|year=1896}}</ref> In Part III, section XV of his book ''[[A Treatise of Human Nature]]'', Hume expanded this to a list of eight ways of judging whether two things might be cause and effect. The first three:\n\n:1. \"The cause and effect must be contiguous in space and time.\"\n:2. \"The cause must be prior to the effect.\"\n:3. \"There must be a constant union betwixt the cause and effect. 'Tis chiefly this quality, that constitutes the relation.\"\nAnd then additionally there are three connected criteria which come from our experience and which are \"the source of most of our philosophical reasonings\":\n:4. \"The same cause always produces the same effect, and the same effect never arises but from the same cause. This principle we derive from experience, and is the source of most of our philosophical reasonings.\"\n:5. Hanging upon the above, Hume says that \"where several different objects produce the same effect, it must be by means of some quality, which we discover to be common amongst them.\"\n:6. And \"founded on the same reason\": \"The difference in the effects of two resembling objects must proceed from that particular, in which they differ.\"\nAnd then two more:\n:7. \"When any object increases or diminishes with the increase or diminution of its cause, 'tis to be regarded as a compounded effect, deriv'd from the union of the several different effects, which arise from the several different parts of the cause.\"\n:8. An \"object, which exists for any time in its full perfection without any effect, is not the sole cause of that effect, but requires to be assisted by some other principle, which may forward its influence and operation.\"\n\nIn 1949, physicist [[Max Born]] distinguished determination from causality. For him, determination meant that actual events are so linked by laws of nature that certainly reliable predictions and retrodictions can be made from sufficient present data about them. He describes two kinds of causation: nomic or generic causation and singular causation. Nomic causality means that cause and effect are linked by more or less certain or probabilistic general laws covering many possible or potential instances; this can be recognized as a probabilized version of Hume's criterion 3. An occasion of singular causation is a particular occurrence of a definite complex of events that are physically linked by antecedence and contiguity, which may be recognized as criteria 1 and 2.<ref name=\"Born\">[[Max Born|Born, M.]] (1949).

He signed for [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] as a youth trainee in July 1999 and the following month he signed professional terms with the club. He played numerous times for the youth and [[Manchester United F.C. Reserves and Academy|reserve]] sides at United and was part of the team that won the [[Manchester Senior Cup]] in  May 2000. He had a short spell on [[Loan (sports)|loan]] at Belgian club [[Royal Antwerp F.C.|Royal Antwerp]] in 2001 before returning to United and making his senior debut in the [[EFL Cup|League Cup]] tie against [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] during the [[2001\u201302 Manchester United F.C. season|2001\u201302 season]]. He was an England youth international as he progressed from the [[England national under-16 football team|under-16s]] to the [[England national under-20 football team|under-20s]] during his time at [[Old Trafford]].\n\nDavis spent three months on loan with [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] club [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]] in 2002 and scored three goals in 15 appearances. He was a mainstay in the reserves on his return to United; his only involvement with the first team after returning was as an unused [[Substitute (association football)|substitute]] in a league game against [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]]  and a [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] second group stage match against [[Deportivo de La Coru\u00f1a]].
