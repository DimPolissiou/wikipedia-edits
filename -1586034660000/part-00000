Often the abscess will start as an internal wound caused by ulceration, hard stool, or penetrative objects with insufficient lubrication.  This wound typically becomes infected as a result of the normal presence of feces in the rectal area, and then develops into an abscess.  This often presents itself as a lump of tissue near the [[anus]] which grows larger and more painful with time.  Like other abscesses, perianal abscesses may require prompt medical treatment, such as an incision and [[debridement]] or [[Lancing (surgical procedure)|lancing]].\n\n{{Anchor|Incisional abscess}}\n\n===Incisional abscess===\nAn ''incisional abscess'' is one that develops as a complication secondary to a [[surgical incision]].

The cytokines trigger an [[inflammation|inflammatory response]], which draws large numbers of [[white blood cell]]s to the area and increases the regional blood flow.\n\nThe final structure of the abscess is an abscess wall, or capsule, that is formed by the adjacent healthy cells in an attempt to keep the pus from infecting neighboring structures.

The drainage of a lung abscess may be performed by positioning the patient in a way that enables the contents to be discharged via the [[respiratory tract]].  Warm compresses and elevation of the limb may be beneficial for a skin abscess.\n\n=== Antibiotics ===\nMost people who have an uncomplicated skin abscess should not use antibiotics.<ref name=\"ACEPfive\"/> Antibiotics in addition to standard incision and drainage is recommended in persons with severe abscesses, many sites of infection, rapid disease progression, the presence of [[cellulitis]], symptoms indicating bacterial illness throughout the body, or a health condition causing [[immunosuppression]].<ref name=NEJM2014/> People who are very young or very old may also need antibiotics.<ref name=NEJM2014/> If the abscess does not heal only with incision and drainage, or if the abscess is in a place that is difficult to drain such as the face, hands, or genitals, then antibiotics may be indicated.<ref name=NEJM2014/>\n\nIn those cases of abscess which do require antibiotic treatment, ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' bacteria is a common cause and an anti-staphylococcus antibiotic such as [[flucloxacillin]] or [[dicloxacillin]] is used. The [[Infectious Diseases Society of America]] advises that the draining of an abscess is not enough to address community-acquired [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'']] (MRSA), and in those cases, traditional antibiotics may be ineffective.<ref name=NEJM2014/> Alternative antibiotics effective against community-acquired MRSA often include [[clindamycin]], [[doxycycline]], [[minocycline]], and [[trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole]].<ref name=NEJM2014/> The [[American College of Emergency Physicians]] advises that typical cases of abscess from MRSA get no benefit from having antibiotic treatment in addition to the standard treatment.<ref name=\"ACEPfive\"/> If the condition is thought to be [[cellulitis]] rather than abscess, consideration should be given to possibility of strep species as cause that are still sensitive to traditional anti-staphylococcus agents such as dicloxacillin or cephalexin in patients able to tolerate penicillin. [[Antibiotic]] therapy alone without surgical drainage of the abscess is seldom effective due to antibiotics often being unable to get into the abscess and their ineffectiveness at low [[pH]] levels.\n\n[[Cell culture|Culturing the wound]] is not needed if standard follow-up care can be provided after the incision and drainage.<ref name=\"ACEPfive\"/> Performing a wound culture is unnecessary because it rarely gives information which can be used to guide treatment.<ref name=\"ACEPfive\"/>\n\n===Packing===\nIn North America, after drainage, an abscess cavity is often packed, perhaps with cloth, in an attempt to protect the healing wound. However, evidence from emergency medicine literature reports that packing wounds after draining causes pain to the person and does not decrease the rate of recurrence, nor bring faster healing or fewer physician visits.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bergstrom|first=KG|title=News, views, and reviews.

Often the abscess will start as an internal wound caused by ulceration, hard stool, or penetrative objects with insufficient lubrication.

The drainage of a lung abscess may be performed by positioning the patient in a way that enables the contents to be discharged via the [[respiratory tract]].  Warm compresses and elevation of the limb may be beneficial for a skin abscess.\n\n=== Antibiotics ===\nMost people who have an uncomplicated skin abscess should not use antibiotics.<ref name=\"ACEPfive\"/> Antibiotics in addition to standard incision and drainage is recommended in persons with severe abscesses, many sites of infection, rapid disease progression, the presence of [[cellulitis]], symptoms indicating bacterial illness throughout the body, or a health condition causing [[immunosuppression]].<ref name=NEJM2014/> People who are very young or very old may also need antibiotics.<ref name=NEJM2014/> If the abscess does not heal only with incision and drainage, or if the abscess is in a place that is difficult to drain such as the face, hands, or genitals, then antibiotics may be indicated.<ref name=NEJM2014/>\n\nIn those cases of abscess which do require antibiotic treatment, ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' bacteria is a common cause and an anti-staphylococcus antibiotic such as [[flucloxacillin]] or [[dicloxacillin]] is used. The [[Infectious Diseases Society of America]] advises that the draining of an abscess is not enough to address community-acquired [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'']] (MRSA), and in those cases, traditional antibiotics may be ineffective.<ref name=NEJM2014/> Alternative antibiotics effective against community-acquired MRSA often include [[clindamycin]], [[doxycycline]], [[minocycline]], and [[trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole]].<ref name=NEJM2014/> The [[American College of Emergency Physicians]] advises that typical cases of abscess from MRSA get no benefit from having antibiotic treatment in addition to the standard treatment.<ref name=\"ACEPfive\"/> If the condition is thought to be [[cellulitis]] rather than abscess, consideration should be given to possibility of strep species as cause that are still sensitive to traditional anti-staphylococcus agents such as dicloxacillin or cephalexin in patients able to tolerate penicillin. [[Antibiotic]] therapy alone without surgical drainage of the abscess is seldom effective due to antibiotics often being unable to get into the abscess and their ineffectiveness at low [[pH]] levels.\n\n[[Cell culture|Culturing the wound]] is not needed if standard follow-up care can be provided after the incision and drainage.<ref name=\"ACEPfive\"/> Performing a wound culture is unnecessary because it rarely gives information which can be used to guide treatment.<ref name=\"ACEPfive\"/>\n\n===Packing===\nIn North America, after drainage, an abscess cavity is often packed, perhaps with cloth, in an attempt to protect the healing wound. However, evidence from emergency medicine literature reports that packing wounds after draining causes pain to the person and does not decrease the rate of recurrence, nor bring faster healing or fewer physician visits.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bergstrom|first=KG|title=News, views, and reviews.

Fused with an eco-system of vibrantly painted flora and fauna, half human/half animal creatures, with screaming mouths and engorged or bleeding eyes are characters in a dizzying scene of erotic hedonism, both explosive and gruesome in its debauchery.<ref name=\"Raqib Shaw: Manchester &ndash; Prague\"/>{{rp|10}}\n\nShaw says these fantastical worlds are inhabited by fantastical creatures including beastmen and manticore which represent the artist, and can be read 'as a commentary on my own experience of living in this sausage factory, and of being alive'.<ref name=\"Raqib Shaw: Manchester &ndash; Prague\"/>{{rp|10}}\n\nA typical painting consists of many stages. Shaw starts with small drawings on paper, featuring characters, flora and fauna. These are then transferred to acetate as individual elements. Shaw begins the composition of the painting by projecting these drawings onto the panel, starting from the centre and working outwards. Once the composition has been drawn out in pen, the panel is taken down from the wall and laid flat. Stained-glass liner is then applied, following the contours of the pen, to create tiny cofferdams. Using small plastic tubes with fine nozzles, paint is then poured into these dams and manipulated by a porcupine quill to suggest form. Glitter is added to specific parts providing extra ornamentation. Lastly, crystals are glued to highlight other areas.<ref name=\"Raqib Shaw: Manchester &ndash; Prague\"/>{{rp|10}}\n\n==Solo exhibitions==\n*Raqib Shaw: Reinventing the Old Masters, Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art (2018)\n*Raqib Shaw: Whitworth Art Gallery, Manchester (2017)\n*New Sculptures, Galerie Thaddaeus Ropac, Salzburg (2015)\n*New Sculptures and Paintings, Galerie Thaddaeus Ropac, Paris (2015)\n*Raqib Shaw: Paradise Lost, Pace Gallery (2013)\n*Raqib Shaw: Galerie Rudolfinium, Prague (2013)\n*Raqib Shaw: Manchester Art Gallery, Manchester (2013)\n*Of Beasts and Super-Beasts, Galerie Thaddaeus Ropac, Paris (2012)\n*Paradise Lost, [[White Cube]], London Masons Yard (2011)\n*Absence Of God, White Cube, London Hoxton Square (2009)\n*Absence Of God, Karlsplatz Project Space, Kunsthalle Wien, Wien (2009)\n*Art Now: Raqib Shaw, Tate Britain, London (2006)\n*Garden of Earthly Delights, Museum of Contemporary Art, North Miami (2006)\n*Garden of Earthly Delights, Deitch Projects, New York (2005)\n*Garden of Earthly Delights, Victoria Miro Gallery, London (2004)\n\n==Collections==\n*[[Amore Pacific Museum of Art]], Korea\n*[[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], New York \n*[[Museum of Modern Art]], New York\n*[[Queensland Art Gallery]], Australia\n*[[Tate Britain]], London\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Shaw, Raqib}}\n[[Category:Indian male painters]]\n[[Category:1974 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Alumni of Central Saint Martins]]\n[[Category:Painters from London]]\n", "text_old": "{{EngvarB|date=September 2014}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2014}}\n{{multiple issues|\n{{blp sources|date=March 2019}}\n{{primary sources|date=March 2019}}\n}}\n'''Raqib Shaw''' (born 1974) is an Indian-born, London-based artist.<ref name=\"Manchester Art Gallery\">{{cite web|url=http://www.manchestergalleries.org/whats-on/exhibitions/index.php?itemID=95|title=Exhibitions Archive - Manchester Art Gallery|website=Manchester Art Gallery}}</ref> He is known for his opulent and intricately detailed paintings of imagined paradises, inlaid with vibrantly coloured jewels and enamel.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraphindia.com/opinion/unlike-any-other/cid/1531987|title=Raqib Shaw, an artist unlike any other|website=www.telegraphindia.com}}</ref><ref name=\"Pace Gallery\">{{cite web|url=http://www.pacegallery.com/artists/435/raqib-shaw|title=Pace Gallery - Raqib Shaw|publisher=}}</ref> His paintings and sculptures evoke the work of Old Masters such as Holbein and Bosch, whilst drawing on multifarious sources, from mythology and religion to poetry, literature, art history, textiles and decorative arts from both eastern and western traditions, all infused with the artist's imagination.<ref name=\"Manchester Art Gallery\" /><ref name=\"Raqib Shaw: Manchester &ndash; Prague\">{{cite book|title=Raqib Shaw: Manchester \u2013 Prague|year=2013|isbn=978-0-901673-83-1}}</ref>{{rp|9}}  \n[[File:Raqib Shaw.jpg|thumb|Raqib Shaw, 2010]]\n\n==Early life==\nRaqib Shaw was born in Calcutta on 1974, but spent his formative years in Kashmir where his family owne and operate Shaw Industries Group, Inc. supplying carpet, resilient, hardwood, tile and stone and laminate flooring products and synthetic turf to residential and commercial markets around the world .<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theedinburghreporter.co.uk/2018/08/at-the-scottish-national-gallery-of-modern-art-raqib-shaw/|title=At the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art \u2013 Raqib Shaw|first=Phyllis|last=Stephen|date=18 August 2018|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/edinburgh-visual-art-review-raqib-shaw-reinventing-the-old-masters-at-the-scottish-national-gallery-of-modern-art-vpbpt8rhj|title=Edinburgh visual art review: Raqib Shaw: Reinventing the Old Masters, at the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art|first=Nancy|last=Durrant|date=10 August 2018|publisher=|via=www.thetimes.co.uk}}</ref>\n\nIn 1989 political unrest began to grow in Kashmir, eventually driving the Shaw family to relocate to New Delhi in 1992.<ref name=\"Of Beasts and Super-Beasts\">{{cite book|title=Raqib Shaw: Of Beasts and Super-Beasts|year=2012|isbn=2-910055-48-5}}</ref>{{rp|146}} From 1992\u20131998 Shaw worked for his maternal uncle in the family business, an activity that ranged from interior design, architecture, to selling jewellery, antiques, carpets and fabrics.

Paradise Lost, 2001-2011.tif|thumb|right|x170px|''Paradise Lost'', 2001\u20132011]]\n\nShaw's paintings suggest a fantastical world full of intricate detail, rich colour and jewel-like surfaces, all masking a collection of intensely violent and sexual images. Fused with an eco-system of vibrantly painted flora and fauna, half human/half animal creatures, with screaming mouths and engorged or bleeding eyes are characters in a dizzying scene of erotic hedonism, both explosive and gruesome in its debauchery.<ref name=\"Raqib Shaw: Manchester &ndash; Prague\"/>{{rp|10}}\n\nShaw says these fantastical worlds are laden with lions and tigers, and can be read 'as a commentary on my own experience of living in this society, and of being alive'.<ref name=\"Raqib Shaw: Manchester &ndash; Prague\"/>{{rp|10}}\n\nA typical painting consists of many stages. Shaw starts with small drawings on paper, featuring characters, flora and fauna. These are then transferred to acetate as individual elements. Shaw begins the composition of the painting by projecting these drawings onto the panel, starting from the centre and working outwards. Once the composition has been drawn out in pen, the panel is taken down from the wall and laid flat. Stained-glass liner is then applied, following the contours of the pen, to create tiny cofferdams. Using small plastic tubes with fine nozzles, paint is then poured into these dams and manipulated by a porcupine quill to suggest form. Glitter is added to specific parts providing extra ornamentation. Lastly, crystals are glued to highlight other areas.<ref name=\"Raqib Shaw: Manchester &ndash; Prague\"/>{{rp|10}}\n\n==Solo exhibitions==\n*Raqib Shaw: Reinventing the Old Masters, Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art (2018)\n*Raqib Shaw: Whitworth Art Gallery, Manchester (2017)\n*New Sculptures, Galerie Thaddaeus Ropac, Salzburg (2015)\n*New Sculptures and Paintings, Galerie Thaddaeus Ropac, Paris (2015)\n*Raqib Shaw: Paradise Lost, Pace Gallery (2013)\n*Raqib Shaw: Galerie Rudolfinium, Prague (2013)\n*Raqib Shaw: Manchester Art Gallery, Manchester (2013)\n*Of Beasts and Super-Beasts, Galerie Thaddaeus Ropac, Paris (2012)\n*Paradise Lost, [[White Cube]], London Masons Yard (2011)\n*Absence Of God, White Cube, London Hoxton Square (2009)\n*Absence Of God, Karlsplatz Project Space, Kunsthalle Wien, Wien (2009)\n*Art Now: Raqib Shaw, Tate Britain, London (2006)\n*Garden of Earthly Delights, Museum of Contemporary Art, North Miami (2006)\n*Garden of Earthly Delights, Deitch Projects, New York (2005)\n*Garden of Earthly Delights, Victoria Miro Gallery, London (2004)\n\n==Collections==\n*[[Amore Pacific Museum of Art]], Korea\n*[[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], New York \n*[[Museum of Modern Art]], New York\n*[[Queensland Art Gallery]], Australia\n*[[Tate Britain]], London\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Shaw, Raqib}}\n[[Category:Indian male painters]]\n[[Category:1974 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Alumni of Central Saint Martins]]\n[[Category:Painters from London]]\n", "name_user": "RogerMajeed", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eArtistic practice", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raqib_Shaw"}

Rabbinical students at the yeshiva often spend a decade or more there, studying a [[Yeshiva#Curriculum|traditional yeshiva curriculum]] focusing on [[Talmud]], ''[[Mussar movement|mussar]]'' (\"ethics\"), and ''[[halakha]]'' (\"Jewish law\").\n\n==Characteristics==\n{{refimprove section|date=February 2008}}\nThere are six primary characteristics of Yeshivas Chofetz Chaim of Queens that distinguish it from other Yeshivos:\n\n#An emphasis upon unfolding the latent processes of reasoning within the steps of the Talmudic ''sugya'' (\"section\") being studied. The methodology places emphasis on the notion that the initial assumptions of the Talmud must be highly rigorous, and that the movement between the initial thought process (known as the ''hava aminah'') of the Talmudic ''sugya'' to the final thought process (known as the ''maskana'') must be fully unfolded and understood.<ref>''Tiferes Dovid'' pp. 28-29 and particularly footnote 14</ref>\n#An approach to ethical and Biblical texts and its commentaries that emphasizes a rigor that other yeshivas of this genre generally accord to Halakhic or Talmudic texts alone. The yeshiva promotes the idea that ideally a deduction from these texts should be ''muchrach'' meaning \"logically and textually compelling.\"  This approach yields a convincing discourse on Torah that is \"well-grounded\".<ref>''Pinnacle of Creation'' \"Anatomy of a Shmuess\" pp. 17-19.</ref>\n#The study of [[Mussar movement|Mussar]] (\"ethics\"), both by attending and reviewing semiweekly lectures (that are presented in the well-grounded method described above) and through daily individual study of Mussar texts, is strongly emphasized. Rabbi [[Dovid Leibowitz]] founded the Chofetz Chaim yeshiva in the footsteps of his [[rebbe]], the [[Alter of Slabodka]], and Rabbi [[Yisrael Salanter|Yisroel Salanter]], the founder of the [[Mussar movement]]. Through the study of ''mussar'' one may hope, over many years, to improve [[moral character|character]] traits by increasing self-awareness and self-control. Rabbi [[Henoch Leibowitz]] would continually remind his students that as important as it is to become a [[lamden]] (\"analytical scholar\") and a great [[pedagogue]], it is even more important to become a [[mentch]] (\"a good human being\").\n#An emphasis on propagating the ideals and values of Judaism. Upon completion of a rigorous term of study, students are encouraged to seek employment in the field of Jewish education, often launching their own educational institutions themselves or with a partner. Hundreds (possibly thousands) of alumni have gone on to become religious instructors, synagogue rabbis, education and outreach coordinators, community leaders, and organizational officials.\n#The omnisignifigance and complete subservience to \"Daas Torah\" as defined by R. A. H. Leibowitz in the introduction to his work \"Chidushei Halev\" as well as numerous public ethical discourses. This is the concept that everything is included in the Torah and the way that the Torah logic (i.e. Talmudic reasoning) works is the way that God's mind works; therefore one who has spent years dedicated to in depth Talmudic study has shaped his mind to think like the Torah/God and is thus able to apply the Torah's logic to all manner of situations.<ref>{{cite web|title=Chofetz Chaim: It's not just a Yeshiva.

The yeshiva promotes the idea that ideally a deduction from these texts should be ''muchrach'' meaning \"logically and textually compelling.\"  This approach yields a convincing discourse on Torah that is \"well-grounded\".<ref>''Pinnacle of Creation'' \"Anatomy of a Shmuess\" pp. 17-19.</ref>\n#The study of [[Mussar movement|Mussar]] (\"ethics\"), both by attending and reviewing semiweekly lectures (that are presented in the well-grounded method described above) and through daily individual study of Mussar texts, is strongly emphasized. Rabbi [[Dovid Leibowitz]] founded the Chofetz Chaim yeshiva in the footsteps of his [[rebbe]], the [[Alter of Slabodka]], and Rabbi [[Yisrael Salanter|Yisroel Salanter]], the founder of the [[Mussar movement]]. Through the study of ''mussar'' one may hope, over many years, to improve [[moral character|character]] traits by increasing self-awareness and self-control. Rabbi [[Henoch Leibowitz]] would continually remind his students that as important as it is to become a [[lamden]] (\"analytical scholar\") and a great [[pedagogue]], it is even more important to become a [[mentch]] (\"a good human being\").\n#An emphasis on propagating the ideals and values of Judaism. Upon completion of a rigorous term of study, students are encouraged to seek employment in the field of Jewish education, often launching their own educational institutions themselves or with a partner. Hundreds (possibly thousands) of alumni have gone on to become religious instructors, synagogue rabbis, education and outreach coordinators, community leaders, and organizational officials.\n#The omnisignifigance and complete subservience to \"Daas Torah\" as defined by R. A. H. Leibowitz in the introduction to his work \"Chidushei Halev\" as well as numerous public ethical discourses. This is the concept that everything is included in the Torah and the way that the Torah logic (i.e. Talmudic reasoning) works is the way that God's mind works; therefore one who has spent years dedicated to in depth Talmudic study has shaped his mind to think like the Torah/God and is thus able to apply the Torah's logic to all manner of situations.<ref>{{cite web|title=Chofetz Chaim: It's not just a Yeshiva.

This is in line with the view of Rabbi [[Henoch Leibowitz]] who once joked that \"A person can be a student of the Torah (\u05d1\u05df \u05ea\u05d5\u05e8\u05d4) ''even'' when wearing a colored shirt.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theyeshivaworld.com/coffeeroom/topic/chofetz-chaim-its-not-just-a-yeshiva-its-a-way-of-life|website=theyeshivaworld.com|title=Topic: Chofetz Chaim: It's not just a Yeshiva.
