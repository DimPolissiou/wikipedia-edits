It stars [[Poulomi Das]] who plays the role of a girl who has a dusky complexion who has to fight the social norm of not being fair-skinned in India.\n\n==Summary==\nKartik likes a girl after seeing her selflessness but Kartik's mother does not like the girl because of her complexion. \n\n==Plot==\nPurnima was treated unfairly from a young age because of her dark complexion. One day, young Purnima gives her trophy for student of the year to her step-sister, Shanaya, but is later caught as someone comes from her school revealing the truth. Purnima's father always stands for Purnima and asks Shanaya to apologise but she refuses. Later, her step-mother, who prefers her daughter, abandons young Purnima at the Golden Temple. In search of her mother, young Purnima meets young Kartik who gives her a bracelet saying the bracelet will give her protection. Kartik's mother gets angry as her son is talking to a girl of dark complexion and middle-class. Purnima, nonetheless, reaches home and takes the blame of being a butterfly. Her father talks to her about how the way you act matters more than the colour of someone's skin complexion. \n\n16 years later, Purnima and Kartik are now adults. Kartik is a doctor who loves volunteering at the temple's footwear storage. While taking Purnima's footwear, he notices the bracelet. Kartik's mother, Soni, hates dark complexion as she is the owner of a fairness beauty brand and wishes for a fairy-like girl, fair complexion is a must. Purnima prays for her sister who is taking part in Miss Amritsar beauty. Purnima calls Shanaya and gives her a definition of beauty that was given to her by her father. Kartik overhears Purnima while he is consulting a patient and gets impressed by her thoughtfulness. Like the Arora sisters, the Mehra brothers have different definitions of beauty. When questioned by Soni, a judge at the show, Shanaya gives the exacts same words Purnima told her. Kartik realises the similarity and concludes that Purnima might be nearby. Soni chooses Shanaya as her future daughter-in-law. Some time later, Kartik spots Purnima who was with her other family members. Soni sees her son and asks him what he was looking at. He points where and Soni sees Shanaya.\n\nNext morning, Soni and Sumreet (Kartik's brother) express their choices that match, both being Shanaya. Soni also plans on making Shanaya face for the company's new product. A boy comes for a marriage proposal for Purnima but they reject her for her complexion. Shanaya needs money for another contest, Miss Punjab. Shanaya steals Purnima's money which the latter collected since childhood.

It stars [[Poulomi Das]] who plays the role of a girl who has a dusky complexion who has to fight the social norm of not being fair-skinned in India.\n\n==Summary==\nKartik likes a girl after seeing her selflessness but Kartik's mother does not like the girl because of her complexion. \n\n==Plot==\nPurnima was treated unfairly from a young age because of her dark complexion. One day, young Purnima gives her trophy for student of the year to her step-sister, Shanaya, but is later caught as someone comes from her school revealing the truth. Purnima's father always stands for Purnima and asks Shanaya to apologise but she refuses. Later, her step-mother, who prefers her daughter, abandons young Purnima at the Golden Temple. In search of her mother, young Purnima meets young Kartik who gives her a bracelet saying the bracelet will give her protection. Kartik's mother gets angry as her son is talking to a girl of dark complexion and middle-class. Purnima, nonetheless, reaches home and takes the blame of being a butterfly. Her father talks to her about how the way you act matters more than the colour of someone's skin complexion. \n\n16 years later, Purnima and Kartik are now adults. Kartik is a doctor who loves volunteering at the temple's footwear storage. While taking Purnima's footwear, he notices the bracelet. Kartik's mother, Soni, hates dark complexion as she is the owner of a fairness beauty brand and wishes for a fairy-like girl, fair complexion is a must. Purnima prays for her sister who is taking part in Miss Amritsar beauty. Purnima calls Shanaya and gives her a definition of beauty that was given to her by her father. Kartik overhears Purnima while he is consulting a patient and gets impressed by her thoughtfulness. Like the Arora sisters, the Mehra brothers have different definitions of beauty. When questioned by Soni, a judge at the show, Shanaya gives the exacts same words Purnima told her. Kartik realises the similarity and concludes that Purnima might be nearby. Soni chooses Shanaya as her future daughter-in-law. Some time later, Kartik spots Purnima who was with her other family members. Soni sees her son and asks him what he was looking at. He points where and Soni sees Shanaya.\n\nNext morning, Soni and Sumreet (Kartik's brother) express their choices that match, both being Shanaya. Soni also plans on making Shanaya face for the company's new product. A boy comes for a marriage proposal for Purnima but they reject her for her complexion. Shanaya needs money for another contest, Miss Punjab. Shanaya steals Purnima's money which the latter collected since childhood. Shanaya gets caught as one of her nails gets found near Purnima's belongings but she has already used the stolen things for her next contest. \n\nPurnima finds a small girl hurt on the road and the people surrounding the little kid are of no help, some shooting videos. Purnima sacrifices her school fees for the girl and donates some of her blood to her. Purnima bumps into Soni and Soni is disgusted. Soni sends a marriage proposal for Shanaya. Shanaya tells her mother that she does not like the idea of marriage. \n\n\n\n==Cast==\n===Main===\n* [[Poulomi Das]] as Purnima Arora\n* Harsh Nagar as Kartik Mehra\n* Kavita Ghai as Soni Mehra, Kartik's mother\n\n===Recurring===\n'''''Surrounding Purnima'''''\n* Purnima's father\n* Purnima's grandmother\n* Purnima's step-mother\n* Shanaya's grandmother\n* Nidhi Shah as Shanaya Arora / Shanu, Purnima's step-sister\n\n\n'''''Surrounding Kartik'''''\n* Mohit Chauhan as Kartik's father\n* [[Shraddha Jaiswal]] as Bably, Kartik's aunt\n* Twinkle Mehra, Kartik's cousin\n* Sumreet Mehra, Kartik's cousin\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:2019 Indian television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2010s Indian television series]]\n[[Category:Hindi-language television programs]]\n[[Category:Indian mythological television series]]\n[[Category:Indian television soap operas]]\n[[Category:Star Bharat television series]]\n\n== External links ==\n", "name_user": "Shameera1234", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200ePlot", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kartik_Purnima_(TV_Show)"}

{"title_page": "Computing Machinery and Intelligence", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2018}}\n{{Use British English|date=April 2018}}\n\"'''Computing Machinery and Intelligence'''\" is a seminal paper written by [[Alan Turing]] on the topic of [[artificial intelligence]]. The paper, published in 1950 in ''[[Mind (journal)|Mind]]'', was the first to introduce his concept of what is now known as the [[Turing test]] to the general public.\n\nTuring's paper considers the question \"Can machines think?\" Since the words \"think\" and \"machine\" cannot be defined in a clear way that satisfies everyone, Turing suggests we \"replace the question by another, which is closely related to it and is expressed in relatively unambiguous words.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Turing|1950|p=433}}</ref> To do this, he must first find a simple and unambiguous idea to replace the word \"think\", second he must explain exactly which \"machines\" he is considering, and finally, armed with these tools, he formulates a new question, related to the first, that he believes he can answer in the affirmative.\n\n==Turing's test==\n[[File:Turing Test version 3.png|thumb|The \"standard interpretation\" of the Turing Test, in which the interrogator is tasked with trying to determine which player is a computer and which is a human]]\n{{Main|Turing test}}\n\nRather than trying to determine if a machine is thinking, Turing suggests we should ask if the machine can win a game, called the \"[[Turing test#Imitation Game|Imitation Game]]\". The original Imitation game that Turing described is a simple party game involving three players. Player A is a man, player B is a woman and player C (who plays the role of the interrogator) can be of either sex. In the Imitation Game, player C is unable to see either player A or player B (and knows them only as X and Y), and can communicate with them only through written notes or any other form that does not give away any details about their gender. By asking questions of player A and player B, player C tries to determine which of the two is the man and which is the woman. Player A's role is to trick the interrogator into making the wrong decision, while player B attempts to assist the interrogator in making the right one.\n  \nTuring proposes a variation of this game that involves the computer: {{' \"}}What will happen when a machine takes the part of A in this game?\" Will the interrogator decide wrongly as often when the game is played like this as he does when the game is played between a man and a woman? These questions replace our original, 'Can machines think?{{\" '}}<ref>{{Harvnb|Turing|1950|p=434}}</ref> \nSo the modified game becomes one that involves three participants in isolated rooms: a computer (which is being tested), a human, and a (human) judge. The human judge can converse with both the human and the computer by typing into a terminal. Both the computer and human try to convince the judge that they are the human. If the judge cannot consistently tell which is which, then the computer wins the game.<ref>This describes the simplest version of the test.

This question avoids the difficult philosophical problem of pre-defining the verb \"to think\" and focuses instead on the performance capacities that being able to think makes possible, and how a causal system can generate them.\n\nSome have taken Turing's question to have been \"Can a computer, communicating over a teleprinter, fool a person into believing it is human?\"<ref name=NMR>Wardrip-Fruin, Noah and Nick Montfort, ed (2003). The New Media Reader. The MIT Press. {{ISBN|0-262-23227-8}}.</ref> but it seems clear that Turing was not talking about fooling people but about generating human cognitive capacity.<ref>{{Citation |url=http://cogprints.org/1584/ |first=Stevan |last=Harnad |title=The Turing Test Is Not A Trick: Turing Indistinguishability Is A Scientific Criterion |journal=SIGART Bulletin |volume=3 |issue=4 |year=1992 |pages=9\u201310 |postscript=. |doi=10.1145/141420.141422 }}</ref>\n\n==Digital machines==\n{{See also|Turing machine|Church\u2013Turing thesis}}\n\nTuring also notes that we need to determine which \"machines\" we wish to consider. He points out that a human [[cloning|clone]], while man-made, would not provide a very interesting example. Turing suggested that we should focus on the capabilities of digital machinery\u2014machines which manipulate the binary digits of 1 and 0, rewriting them into memory using simple rules. He gave two reasons.\n\nFirst, there is no reason to speculate whether or not they can exist. They already did in 1950.\n\nSecond, digital machinery is \"universal\". Turing's research into the [[theory of computation|foundations of computation]] had proved that a digital computer can, in theory, simulate the behaviour of any other digital machine, given enough memory and time. (This is the essential insight of the [[Church\u2013Turing thesis]] and the [[universal Turing machine]].) Therefore, if ''any'' digital machine can \"act like it is thinking\" then, ''every'' sufficiently powerful digital machine can. Turing writes, \"all digital computers are in a sense equivalent.\"<ref name=P442>{{Harvnb|Turing|1950|p=442}}</ref>\n\nThis allows the original question to be made even more specific. Turing now restates the original question as \"Let us fix our attention on one particular digital computer C. Is it true that by modifying this computer to have an adequate storage, suitably increasing its speed of action, and providing it with an appropriate programme, C can be made to play satisfactorily the part of A in the imitation game, the part of B being taken by a man?\"<ref name=P442/>\n\nHence Turing states that the focus is not on \"whether all digital computers would do well in the game nor whether the computers that are presently available would do well, but whether there are imaginable computers which would do well\".<ref name=P436>{{Harvnb|Turing|1950|p=436}}</ref> What is more important is to consider the advancements possible in the state of our machines today regardless of whether we have the available resource to create one or not.\n\n==Nine common objections==\n{{See also|Philosophy of artificial intelligence}}\n\nHaving clarified the question, Turing turned to answering it: he considered the following nine common objections, which include all the major arguments against artificial intelligence raised in the years since his paper was first published.<ref>{{Harvnb|Turing|1950}} and see {{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=948}} where comment \"Turing examined a wide variety of possible objections to the possibility of intelligent machines, including virtually all of those that have been raised in the half century since his paper appeared.\"</ref>\n\n#''[[Religious]] Objection'': This states that thinking is a function of man's [[Immortality|immortal]] [[soul]]; therefore, a machine cannot think.  \"In attempting to construct such machines,\" wrote Turing, \"we should not be irreverently usurping His power of creating souls, any more than we are in the procreation of children: rather we are, in either case, instruments of His will providing mansions for the souls that He creates.\"\n#'' 'Heads in the Sand' Objection'': \"The consequences of machines thinking would be too dreadful.  Let us hope and believe that they cannot do so.\"  This thinking is popular among intellectual people, as they believe superiority derives from higher intelligence and [[Existential risk from artificial general intelligence|the possibility of being overtaken is a threat]] (as machines have efficient memory capacities and processing speed, machines exceeding the learning and knowledge capabilities are highly probable). This objection is a fallacious [[appeal to consequences]], confusing what should not be with what can or cannot be (Wardrip-Fruin, 56).\n#''[[Mathematics|Mathematical]] Objections'': This objection uses mathematical theorems, such as [[G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorem]], to show that there are limits to what questions a computer system based on [[logic]] can answer.  Turing suggests that humans are too often wrong themselves and pleased at the fallibility of a machine.  (This argument would be made again by philosopher [[John Lucas (philosopher)|John Lucas]] in 1961 and [[physicist]] [[Roger Penrose]] in 1989.)<ref>{{Harvnb|Lucas|1961}}, {{Harvnb|Penrose|1989}}, {{Harvnb|Hofstadter|1979|pp=471\u2013473,476\u2013477}} and {{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003|pp=949\u2013950}}. Russell and Norvig identify Lucas and Penrose's arguments as being the same one answered by Turing.</ref>\n#''Argument From [[Consciousness]]'': This argument, suggested by Professor [[Geoffrey Jefferson]] in his 1949 Lister Oration states that \"not until a machine can write a sonnet or compose a concerto because of thoughts and emotions felt, and not by the chance fall of symbols, could we agree that machine equals brain.\"<ref>[http://www.turingarchive.org/browse.php/B/44 \"The Mind of Mechanical Man\"]</ref>  Turing replies by saying that we have no way of knowing that any individual other than ourselves experiences emotions, and that therefore we should accept the test.  He adds, \"I do not wish to give the impression that I think there is no mystery about consciousness ... [b]ut I do not think these mysteries necessarily need to be solved before we can answer the question [of whether machines can think].\" (This argument, that a computer can't have ''conscious experiences'' or ''understanding'', would be made in 1980 by philosopher [[John Searle]] in his [[Chinese room]] argument. Turing's reply is now known as the \"[[problem of other minds|other minds]] reply\". See also [[Philosophy of artificial intelligence#Can a machine have a mind, consciousness and mental states?|Can a machine have a mind?]] in the [[philosophy of AI]].)<ref>{{Harvnb|Searle|1980}} and {{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003|pp=958\u2013960}}, who identify Searle's argument with the one Turing answers.</ref>\n#''Arguments from various disabilities''. These arguments all have the form \"a computer will never do ''X''\". Turing offers a selection:<blockquote>Be kind, resourceful, beautiful, friendly, have initiative, have a sense of humour, tell right from wrong, make mistakes, fall in love, enjoy strawberries and cream, make someone fall in love with it, learn from experience, use words properly, be the subject of its own thought, have as much diversity of behaviour as a man, do something really new.</blockquote>Turing notes that \"no support is usually offered for these statements,\" and that they depend on naive assumptions about how versatile machines may be in the future, or are \"disguised forms of the argument from consciousness.\" He chooses to answer a few of them:\n##''Machines cannot make mistakes.'' He notes it's easy to program a machine to appear to make a mistake.\n##''A machine cannot be the subject of its own thought'' (or can't be [[self-aware]]). A program which can report on its internal states and processes, in the simple sense of a [[debugger]] program, can certainly be written. Turing asserts \"a machine can undoubtably be its own subject matter.\"\n##''A machine cannot have much diversity of behaviour''. He notes that, with enough storage capacity, a computer can behave in an astronomical number of different ways.\n#''[[Ada Lovelace|Lady Lovelace]]'s Objection'': One of the most famous objections states that computers are incapable of originality. This is largely because, according to [[Ada Lovelace]], machines are incapable of independent learning.<blockquote>The Analytical Engine has no pretensions whatever to originate anything. It can do whatever we know how to order it to perform. It can follow analysis; but it has no power of anticipating any analytical relations or truths.</blockquote> Turing suggests that Lovelace's objection can be reduced to the assertion that computers \"can never take us by surprise\" and argues that, to the contrary, computers could still surprise humans, in particular where the consequences of different facts are not immediately recognizable. Turing also argues that Lady Lovelace was hampered by the context from which she wrote, and if exposed to more contemporary scientific knowledge, it would become evident that the brain's storage is quite similar to that of a computer.\n#''Argument from continuity in the nervous system'': Modern [[neurological]] research has shown that the brain is not digital. Even though [[neuron]]s fire in an all-or-nothing pulse, both the exact timing of the pulse and the probability of the pulse occurring have analog components. Turing acknowledges this, but argues that any analog system can be simulated to a reasonable degree of accuracy given enough computing power. ([[Philosopher]] [[Hubert Dreyfus]] would make this argument against \"the biological assumption\" in 1972.)<ref>{{Harvnb|Dreyfus|1979|p=156}}</ref>\n#''Argument from the informality of behaviour'': This argument states that any system governed by laws will be predictable and therefore not truly intelligent. Turing replies by stating that this is confusing laws of behaviour with general rules of conduct, and that if on a broad enough scale (such as is evident in man) machine behaviour would become increasingly difficult to predict. He argues that, just because we can't immediately see what the laws are, does not mean that no such laws exist. He writes \"we certainly know of no circumstances under which we could say, 'we have searched enough. There are no such laws.'\". ([[Hubert Dreyfus]] would argue in 1972 that human reason and problem solving was not based on formal rules, but instead relied on instincts and awareness that would never be captured in rules. More recent AI research in [[robotics]] and [[computational intelligence]] attempts to find the complex rules that govern our \"informal\" and unconscious skills of perception, mobility and pattern matching. See [[Dreyfus' critique of AI]]).<ref>{{Harvnb|Dreyfus|1972}}, {{Harvnb|Dreyfus|Dreyfus|1986}}, {{Harvnb|Moravec|1988}} and {{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003|pp=51\u201352}}, who identify Dreyfus' argument with the one Turing answers.</ref> This rejoinder also includes the [[Turing's Wager]] argument.\n#''[[Extra-sensory perception]]'': In 1950, extra-sensory perception was an active area of research and Turing chooses to give ESP the benefit of the doubt, arguing that conditions could be created in which [[Telepathy|mind-reading]] would not affect the test.\n\n==Learning machines==\n{{see also|Machine learning}}\nIn the final section of the paper Turing details his thoughts about the Learning Machine that could play the imitation game successfully.\n\nHere Turing first returns to Lady Lovelace's objection that the machine can only do what we tell it to do and he likens it to a situation where a man \"injects\" an idea into the machine to which the machine responds and then falls off into quiescence. He extends on this thought by an analogy to an atomic pile of less than critical size which is to be considered the machine and an injected idea is to correspond to a [[neutron]] entering the pile from outside the pile; the neutron will cause a certain disturbance which eventually dies away. Turing then builds on that analogy and mentions that if the [[Critical mass|size]] of the pile were to be sufficiently large then a neutron entering the pile would cause a disturbance that would continue to increase until the whole pile were destroyed, the pile would be supercritical. Turing then asks the question as to whether this analogy of a super critical pile could be extended to a human mind and then to a machine. He concludes that such an analogy would indeed be suitable for the human mind with \"There does seem to be one for the human mind. The majority of them seem to be \"subcritical,\" i.e., to correspond in this analogy to piles of sub critical size. An idea presented to such a mind will on average give rise to less than one idea in reply. A smallish proportion are supercritical. An idea presented to such a mind that may give rise to a whole \"theory\" consisting of secondary, tertiary and more remote ideas\". He finally asks if a machine could be made to be supercritical.\n\nTuring then mentions that the task of being able to create a machine that could play the imitation game is one of programming and he postulates that by the end of the century it will indeed be technologically possible to program a machine to play the game. He then mentions that in the process of trying to imitate an adult human mind it becomes important to consider the processes that lead to the adult mind being in its present state; which he summarizes as:\n::1. The initial state of the mind, say at birth,\n::2. The education to which it has been subjected,\n::3. Other experience, not to be described as education, to which it has been subjected.\nGiven this process he asks whether it would be more appropriate to program a child's mind instead of an adults mind and then subject the child mind to a period of education. He likens the child to a newly bought notebook and speculates that due to its simplicity it would be more easily programmed. The problem then is broken down into two parts, the programming of a child mind and its education process. He mentions that a child mind would not be expected as desired by the experimenter (programmer) at the first attempt. A learning process that involves a method of reward and punishment must be in place that will select desirable patterns in the mind. This whole process, Turing mentions, to a large extent is similar to that of evolution by natural selection where the similarities are:\n::Structure of the child machine = hereditary material\n::Changes of the child machine = mutations\n::Natural selection = judgment of the experimenter\nFollowing this discussion Turing addresses certain specific aspects of the learning machine: \n:* Nature of inherent complexity: The child machine could either be one that is as simple as possible, merely maintaining consistency with general principles, or the machine could be one with a complete system of logical inference programmed into it. This more complex system is explained by Turing as \"..would be such that the machines store would be largely occupied with definitions and [[proposition]]s. The propositions would have various kinds of status, e.g., well-established facts, conjectures, mathematically proved theorems, statements given by an authority, expressions having the logical form of proposition but not belief-value. Certain propositions may be described as \"imperatives.\" The machine should be so constructed that as soon as an imperative is classed as \"well established\" the appropriate action automatically takes place.\". Despite this built-in logic system the logical inference programmed in would not be one that is formal, rather it would be one that is more pragmatic. In addition the machine would build on its built-in logic system by a method of \"scientific induction\".\n\n:* Ignorance of the experimenter: An important feature of a learning machine that Turing points out is the ignorance of the teacher of the machines' internal state during the learning process. This is in contrast to a conventional discrete state machine where the objective is to have a clear understanding of the internal state of the machine at every moment during the computation. The machine will be seen to be doing things that we often cannot make sense of or something that we consider to be completely random. Turing mentions that this specific character bestows upon a machine a certain degree of what we consider to be intelligence, in that intelligent behaviour consists of a deviation from the complete determinism of conventional computation but only so long as the deviation does not give rise to pointless loops or random behaviour.\n\n:* The importance of random behaviour: Though Turing cautions us of random behaviour he mentions that inculcating an element of randomness in a learning machine would be of value in a system. He mentions that this could be of value where there might be multiple correct answers or ones where it might be such that a systematic approach would investigate several unsatisfactory solutions to a problem before finding the optimal solution which would entail the systematic process inefficient. Turing also mentions that the process of evolution takes the path of random mutations in order to find solutions that benefit an organism but he also admits that in the case of evolution the systematic method of finding a solution would not be possible.\n\nTuring concludes by speculating about a time when machines will compete with humans on numerous intellectual tasks and suggests tasks that could be used to make that start. Turing then suggests that abstract tasks such as playing chess could be a good place to start another method which he puts as \"..it is best to provide the machine with the best sense organs that money can buy, and then teach it to understand and speak English.\".\n\nAn examination of the development in [[artificial intelligence]] that has followed reveals that the learning machine did take the abstract path suggested by Turing as in the case of [[Deep Blue (chess computer)|Deep Blue]], a chess playing computer developed by [[IBM]] and one which defeated the world champion [[Garry Kasparov]] (though, this too is controversial) and the numerous computer chess games which can outplay most amateurs.<ref name=\"ParsingTT2008\">{{cite book|last1=Epstein|first1=Robert|last2=Roberts|first2=Gary|last3=Beber|first3=Grace|title=Parsing the Turing Test:Philosophical and Methodological Issues in the Quest for the Thinking Computer|date=2008|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-4020-6710-5|page=65|url=https://books.google.com/?id=aggUJL_5_oQC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref> As for the second suggestion Turing makes, it has been likened by some authors as a call to finding a [[simulacrum]] of human cognitive development.<ref name=\"ParsingTT2008\"/> And such attempts at finding the underlying algorithms by which children learn of the features of the world around them are only beginning to be made.<ref name=\"ParsingTT2008\"/><ref>{{cite book|last1=Gopnik|first1=Alison|last2=Meltzoff.|first2=Andrew N.|title=Words, thoughts, and theories.|date=1997|publisher=MIT Press|url=http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/words-thoughts-and-theories}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Meltzoff|first1=Andrew N.|title=Origins of theory of mind, cognition and communication.|journal=Journal of Communication Disorders|date=1999|volume=32|issue=4|pages=251\u2013269|url=http://ilabs.washington.edu/meltzoff/pdf/99Meltzoff_JCommDisord.pdf|doi=10.1016/S0021-9924(99)00009-X|pmid=10466097|pmc=3629913}}</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{Citation | first = Rodney | last = Brooks | title = Elephants Don't Play Chess | journal = Robotics and Autonomous Systems | volume=6 | issue = 1\u20132 | year =1990 | pages = 3\u201315 | author-link=Rodney Brooks | url=http://people.csail.mit.edu/brooks/papers/elephants.pdf | accessdate=2007-08-30 | doi = 10.1016/S0921-8890(05)80025-9| citeseerx = 10.1.1.588.7539 }}\n* {{Crevier 1993}}\n* {{Citation | last = Dreyfus | first = Hubert  | title = What Computers Can't Do | year =1972 | publisher = MIT Press | location = New York | authorlink = Hubert Dreyfus | isbn = 978-0-06-011082-6 | title-link = What Computers Can't Do  }}\n* {{Citation | last = Dreyfus | first = Hubert | last2 = Dreyfus | first2 = Stuart | year = 1986 | title = Mind over Machine: The Power of Human Intuition and Expertise in the Era of the Computer | publisher = Blackwell | location = Oxford, UK | authorlink = Hubert Dreyfus }}\n* {{Citation | last = Dreyfus | first = Hubert  | title = What Computers ''Still'' Can't Do | year =1979 | publisher = MIT Press | location = New York | authorlink = Hubert Dreyfus }}.\n* {{Citation | doi = 10.1016/j.artmed.2008.08.008 | last = Harnad | first = Stevan | last2 = Scherzer | first2 = Peter  | title = First, Scale Up to the Robotic Turing Test, Then Worry About Feeling | journal = Artificial Intelligence in Medicine | volume = 44 | issue = 2 | year = 2008 | pages = 83\u20139 | author-link=Stevan Harnad | url=http://eprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/14430/ | pmid = 18930641 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.115.4269 }}.\n* {{Citation | first = John | last = Haugeland | year = 1985 | title = Artificial Intelligence: The Very Idea | publisher=MIT Press | author-link = John Haugeland| location= Cambridge, Mass.}}.\n* {{Citation | first = Hans | last = Moravec | year = 1976 | url = http://www.frc.ri.cmu.edu/users/hpm/project.archive/general.articles/1975/Raw.Power.html | title = The Role of Raw Power in Intelligence | author-link = Hans Moravec | access-date = 7 November 2007 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160303232511/http://www.frc.ri.cmu.edu/users/hpm/project.archive/general.articles/1975/Raw.Power.html | archive-date = 3 March 2016 | url-status = dead }}\n* {{Russell Norvig 2003}}\n* {{Citation | doi= 10.1017/S0140525X00005756 | first= John| last= Searle | url = http://members.aol.com/NeoNoetics/MindsBrainsPrograms.html  | title = Minds, Brains and Programs | journal = Behavioral and Brain Sciences | volume = 3| issue = 3| pages= 417\u2013457 | year = 1980 | author-link=John Searle}}\n* {{Citation | last = Turing | first = Alan | title = Computing Machinery and Intelligence | journal=Mind | volume = LIX | issue = 236 |date = October 1950| pages= 433\u2013460 | url = https://www.csee.umbc.edu/courses/471/papers/turing.pdf| authorlink = Alan Turing | doi=10.1093/mind/LIX.236.433}}\n* {{cite journal | last1 = Saygin | first1 = A.

The paper, published in 1950 in ''[[Mind (journal)|Mind]]'', was the first to introduce his concept of what is now known as the [[Turing test]] to the general public.\n\nTuring's paper considers the question \"Can machines think?\" Since the words \"think\" and \"machine\" cannot be defined in a clear way that satisfies everyone, Turing suggests we \"replace the question by another, which is closely related to it and is expressed in relatively unambiguous words.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Turing|1950|p=433}}</ref> To do this, he must first find a simple and unambiguous idea to replace the word \"think\", second he must explain exactly which \"machines\" he is considering, and finally, armed with these tools, he formulates a new question, related to the first, that he believes he can answer in the affirmative.\n\n==Turing's test==\n[[File:Turing Test version 3.png|thumb|The \"standard interpretation\" of the Turing Test, in which the interrogator is tasked with trying to determine which player is a computer and which is a human]]\n{{Main|Turing test}}\n\nRather than trying to determine if a machine is thinking, Turing suggests we should ask if the machine can win a game, called the \"[[Turing test#Imitation Game|Imitation Game]]\". The original Imitation game that Turing described is a simple party game involving three players. Player A is a man, player B is a woman and player C (who plays the role of the interrogator) can be of either sex. In the Imitation Game, player C is unable to see either player A or player B (and knows them only as X and Y), and can communicate with them only through written notes or any other form that does not give away any details about their gender. By asking questions of player A and player B, player C tries to determine which of the two is the man and which is the woman. Player A's role is to trick the interrogator into making the wrong decision, while player B attempts to assist the interrogator in making the right one.\n  \nTuring proposes a variation of this game that involves the computer: {{' \"}}What will happen when a machine takes the part of A in this game?\" Will the interrogator decide wrongly as often when the game is played like this as he does when the game is played between a man and a woman? These questions replace our original, 'Can machines think?{{\" '}}<ref>{{Harvnb|Turing|1950|p=434}}</ref> \nSo the modified game becomes one that involves three participants in isolated rooms: a computer (which is being tested), a human, and a (human) judge. The human judge can converse with both the human and the computer by typing into a terminal. Both the computer and human try to convince the judge that they are the human. If the judge cannot consistently tell which is which, then the computer wins the game.<ref>This describes the simplest version of the test.

This question avoids the difficult philosophical problem of pre-defining the verb \"to think\" and focuses instead on the performance capacities that being able to think makes possible, and how a causal system can generate them.\n\nSome have taken Turing's question to have been \"Can a computer, communicating over a teleprinter, fool a person into believing it is human?\"<ref name=NMR>Wardrip-Fruin, Noah and Nick Montfort, ed (2003).

He points out that a human [[cloning|clone]], while man-made, would not provide a very interesting example. Turing suggested that we should focus on the capabilities of digital machinery\u2014machines which manipulate the binary digits of 1 and 0, rewriting them into memory using simple rules. He gave two reasons.\n\nFirst, there is no reason to speculate whether or not they can exist. They already did in 1950.\n\nSecond, digital machinery is \"universal\". Turing's research into the [[theory of computation|foundations of computation]] had proved that a digital computer can, in theory, simulate the behaviour of any other digital machine, given enough memory and time. (This is the essential insight of the [[Church\u2013Turing thesis]] and the [[universal Turing machine]].) Therefore, if ''any'' digital machine can \"act like it is thinking\" then, ''every'' sufficiently powerful digital machine can. Turing writes, \"all digital computers are in a sense equivalent.\"<ref name=P442>{{Harvnb|Turing|1950|p=442}}</ref>\n\nThis allows the original question to be made even more specific. Turing now restates the original question as \"Let us fix our attention on one particular digital computer C. Is it true that by modifying this computer to have an adequate storage, suitably increasing its speed of action, and providing it with an appropriate programme, C can be made to play satisfactorily the part of A in the imitation game, the part of B being taken by a man?\"<ref name=P442/>\n\nHence Turing states that the focus is not on \"whether all digital computers would do well in the game nor whether the computers that are presently available would do well, but whether there are imaginable computers which would do well\".<ref name=P436>{{Harvnb|Turing|1950|p=436}}</ref> What is more important is to consider the advancements possible in the state of our machines today regardless of whether we have the available resource to create one or not.\n\n==Nine common objections==\n{{See also|Philosophy of artificial intelligence}}\n\nHaving clarified the question, Turing turned to answering it: he considered the following nine common objections, which include all the major arguments against artificial intelligence raised in the years since his paper was first published.<ref>{{Harvnb|Turing|1950}} and see {{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=948}} where comment \"Turing examined a wide variety of possible objections to the possibility of intelligent machines, including virtually all of those that have been raised in the half century since his paper appeared.\"</ref>\n\n#''[[Religious]] Objection'': This states that thinking is a function of man's [[Immortality|immortal]] [[soul]]; therefore, a machine cannot think.  \"In attempting to construct such machines,\" wrote Turing, \"we should not be irreverently usurping His power of creating souls, any more than we are in the procreation of children: rather we are, in either case, instruments of His will providing mansions for the souls that He creates.\"\n#'' 'Heads in the Sand' Objection'': \"The consequences of machines thinking would be too dreadful.  Let us hope and believe that they cannot do so.\"  This thinking is popular among intellectual people, as they believe superiority derives from higher intelligence and [[Existential risk from artificial general intelligence|the possibility of being overtaken is a threat]] (as machines have efficient memory capacities and processing speed, machines exceeding the learning and knowledge capabilities are highly probable). This objection is a fallacious [[appeal to consequences]], confusing what should not be with what can or cannot be (Wardrip-Fruin, 56).\n#''[[Mathematics|Mathematical]] Objections'': This objection uses mathematical theorems, such as [[G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorem]], to show that there are limits to what questions a computer system based on [[logic]] can answer.  Turing suggests that humans are too often wrong themselves and pleased at the fallibility of a machine.  (This argument would be made again by philosopher [[John Lucas (philosopher)|John Lucas]] in 1961 and [[physicist]] [[Roger Penrose]] in 1989.)<ref>{{Harvnb|Lucas|1961}}, {{Harvnb|Penrose|1989}}, {{Harvnb|Hofstadter|1979|pp=471\u2013473,476\u2013477}} and {{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003|pp=949\u2013950}}. Russell and Norvig identify Lucas and Penrose's arguments as being the same one answered by Turing.</ref>\n#''Argument From [[Consciousness]]'': This argument, suggested by Professor [[Geoffrey Jefferson]] in his 1949 Lister Oration states that \"not until a machine can write a sonnet or compose a concerto because of thoughts and emotions felt, and not by the chance fall of symbols, could we agree that machine equals brain.\"<ref>[http://www.turingarchive.org/browse.php/B/44 \"The Mind of Mechanical Man\"]</ref>  Turing replies by saying that we have no way of knowing that any individual other than ourselves experiences emotions, and that therefore we should accept the test.  He adds, \"I do not wish to give the impression that I think there is no mystery about consciousness ... [b]ut I do not think these mysteries necessarily need to be solved before we can answer the question [of whether machines can think].\" (This argument, that a computer can't have ''conscious experiences'' or ''understanding'', would be made in 1980 by philosopher [[John Searle]] in his [[Chinese room]] argument. Turing's reply is now known as the \"[[problem of other minds|other minds]] reply\". See also [[Philosophy of artificial intelligence#Can a machine have a mind, consciousness and mental states?|Can a machine have a mind?]] in the [[philosophy of AI]].)<ref>{{Harvnb|Searle|1980}} and {{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003|pp=958\u2013960}}, who identify Searle's argument with the one Turing answers.</ref>\n#''Arguments from various disabilities''. These arguments all have the form \"a computer will never do ''X''\". Turing offers a selection:<blockquote>Be kind, resourceful, beautiful, friendly, have initiative, have a sense of humour, tell right from wrong, make mistakes, fall in love, enjoy strawberries and cream, make someone fall in love with it, learn from experience, use words properly, be the subject of its own thought, have as much diversity of behaviour as a man, do something really new.</blockquote>Turing notes that \"no support is usually offered for these statements,\" and that they depend on naive assumptions about how versatile machines may be in the future, or are \"disguised forms of the argument from consciousness.\" He chooses to answer a few of them:\n##''Machines cannot make mistakes.'' He notes it's easy to program a machine to appear to make a mistake.\n##''A machine cannot be the subject of its own thought'' (or can't be [[self-aware]]). A program which can report on its internal states and processes, in the simple sense of a [[debugger]] program, can certainly be written. Turing asserts \"a machine can undoubtably be its own subject matter.\"\n##''A machine cannot have much diversity of behaviour''. He notes that, with enough storage capacity, a computer can behave in an astronomical number of different ways.\n#''[[Ada Lovelace|Lady Lovelace]]'s Objection'': One of the most famous objections states that computers are incapable of originality. This is largely because, according to [[Ada Lovelace]], machines are incapable of independent learning.<blockquote>The Analytical Engine has no pretensions whatever to originate anything. It can do whatever we know how to order it to perform. It can follow analysis; but it has no power of anticipating any analytical relations or truths.</blockquote> Turing suggests that Lovelace's objection can be reduced to the assertion that computers \"can never take us by surprise\" and argues that, to the contrary, computers could still surprise humans, in particular where the consequences of different facts are not immediately recognizable. Turing also argues that Lady Lovelace was hampered by the context from which she wrote, and if exposed to more contemporary scientific knowledge, it would become evident that the brain's storage is quite similar to that of a computer.\n#''Argument from continuity in the nervous system'': Modern [[neurological]] research has shown that the brain is not digital. Even though [[neuron]]s fire in an all-or-nothing pulse, both the exact timing of the pulse and the probability of the pulse occurring have analog components. Turing acknowledges this, but argues that any analog system can be simulated to a reasonable degree of accuracy given enough computing power. ([[Philosopher]] [[Hubert Dreyfus]] would make this argument against \"the biological assumption\" in 1972.)<ref>{{Harvnb|Dreyfus|1979|p=156}}</ref>\n#''Argument from the informality of behaviour'': This argument states that any system governed by laws will be predictable and therefore not truly intelligent. Turing replies by stating that this is confusing laws of behaviour with general rules of conduct, and that if on a broad enough scale (such as is evident in man) machine behaviour would become increasingly difficult to predict. He argues that, just because we can't immediately see what the laws are, does not mean that no such laws exist. He writes \"we certainly know of no circumstances under which we could say, 'we have searched enough. There are no such laws.'\". ([[Hubert Dreyfus]] would argue in 1972 that human reason and problem solving was not based on formal rules, but instead relied on instincts and awareness that would never be captured in rules. More recent AI research in [[robotics]] and [[computational intelligence]] attempts to find the complex rules that govern our \"informal\" and unconscious skills of perception, mobility and pattern matching. See [[Dreyfus' critique of AI]]).<ref>{{Harvnb|Dreyfus|1972}}, {{Harvnb|Dreyfus|Dreyfus|1986}}, {{Harvnb|Moravec|1988}} and {{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003|pp=51\u201352}}, who identify Dreyfus' argument with the one Turing answers.</ref> This rejoinder also includes the [[Turing's Wager]] argument.\n#''[[Extra-sensory perception]]'': In 1950, extra-sensory perception was an active area of research and Turing chooses to give ESP the benefit of the doubt, arguing that conditions could be created in which [[Telepathy|mind-reading]] would not affect the test.\n\n==Learning machines==\n{{see also|Machine learning}}\nIn the final section of the paper Turing details his thoughts about the Learning Machine that could play the imitation game successfully.\n\nHere Turing first returns to Lady Lovelace's objection that the machine can only do what we tell it to do and he likens it to a situation where a man \"injects\" an idea into the machine to which the machine responds and then falls off into quiescence. He extends on this thought by an analogy to an atomic pile of less than critical size which is to be considered the machine and an injected idea is to correspond to a [[neutron]] entering the pile from outside the pile; the neutron will cause a certain disturbance which eventually dies away. Turing then builds on that analogy and mentions that if the [[Critical mass|size]] of the pile were to be sufficiently large then a neutron entering the pile would cause a disturbance that would continue to increase until the whole pile were destroyed, the pile would be supercritical. Turing then asks the question as to whether this analogy of a super critical pile could be extended to a human mind and then to a machine. He concludes that such an analogy would indeed be suitable for the human mind with \"There does seem to be one for the human mind. The majority of them seem to be \"subcritical,\" i.e., to correspond in this analogy to piles of sub critical size. An idea presented to such a mind will on average give rise to less than one idea in reply. A smallish proportion are supercritical. An idea presented to such a mind that may give rise to a whole \"theory\" consisting of secondary, tertiary and more remote ideas\". He finally asks if a machine could be made to be supercritical.\n\nTuring then mentions that the task of being able to create a machine that could play the imitation game is one of programming and he postulates that by the end of the century it will indeed be technologically possible to program a machine to play the game. He then mentions that in the process of trying to imitate an adult human mind it becomes important to consider the processes that lead to the adult mind being in its present state; which he summarizes as:\n::1. The initial state of the mind, say at birth,\n::2. The education to which it has been subjected,\n::3. Other experience, not to be described as education, to which it has been subjected.\nGiven this process he asks whether it would be more appropriate to program a child's mind instead of an adults mind and then subject the child mind to a period of education. He likens the child to a newly bought notebook and speculates that due to its simplicity it would be more easily programmed. The problem then is broken down into two parts, the programming of a child mind and its education process. He mentions that a child mind would not be expected as desired by the experimenter (programmer) at the first attempt. A learning process that involves a method of reward and punishment must be in place that will select desirable patterns in the mind. This whole process, Turing mentions, to a large extent is similar to that of evolution by natural selection where the similarities are:\n::Structure of the child machine = hereditary material\n::Changes of the child machine = mutations\n::Natural selection = judgment of the experimenter\nFollowing this discussion Turing addresses certain specific aspects of the learning machine: \n:* Nature of inherent complexity: The child machine could either be one that is as simple as possible, merely maintaining consistency with general principles, or the machine could be one with a complete system of logical inference programmed into it. This more complex system is explained by Turing as \"..would be such that the machines store would be largely occupied with definitions and [[proposition]]s. The propositions would have various kinds of status, e.g., well-established facts, conjectures, mathematically proved theorems, statements given by an authority, expressions having the logical form of proposition but not belief-value. Certain propositions may be described as \"imperatives.\" The machine should be so constructed that as soon as an imperative is classed as \"well established\" the appropriate action automatically takes place.\". Despite this built-in logic system the logical inference programmed in would not be one that is formal, rather it would be one that is more pragmatic. In addition the machine would build on its built-in logic system by a method of \"scientific induction\".\n\n:* Ignorance of the experimenter: An important feature of a learning machine that Turing points out is the ignorance of the teacher of the machines' internal state during the learning process. This is in contrast to a conventional discrete state machine where the objective is to have a clear understanding of the internal state of the machine at every moment during the computation. The machine will be seen to be doing things that we often cannot make sense of or something that we consider to be completely random. Turing mentions that this specific character bestows upon a machine a certain degree of what we consider to be intelligence, in that intelligent behaviour consists of a deviation from the complete determinism of conventional computation but only so long as the deviation does not give rise to pointless loops or random behaviour.\n\n:* The importance of random behaviour: Though Turing cautions us of random behaviour he mentions that inculcating an element of randomness in a learning machine would be of value in a system. He mentions that this could be of value where there might be multiple correct answers or ones where it might be such that a systematic approach would investigate several unsatisfactory solutions to a problem before finding the optimal solution which would entail the systematic process inefficient. Turing also mentions that the process of evolution takes the path of random mutations in order to find solutions that benefit an organism but he also admits that in the case of evolution the systematic method of finding a solution would not be possible.\n\nTuring concludes by speculating about a time when machines will compete with humans on numerous intellectual tasks and suggests tasks that could be used to make that start. Turing then suggests that abstract tasks such as playing chess could be a good place to start another method which he puts as \"..it is best to provide the machine with the best sense organs that money can buy, and then teach it to understand and speak English.\".\n\nAn examination of the development in [[artificial intelligence]] that has followed reveals that the learning machine did take the abstract path suggested by Turing as in the case of [[Deep Blue (chess computer)|Deep Blue]], a chess playing computer developed by [[IBM]] and one which defeated the world champion [[Garry Kasparov]] (though, this too is controversial) and the numerous computer chess games which can outplay most amateurs.<ref name=\"ParsingTT2008\">{{cite book|last1=Epstein|first1=Robert|last2=Roberts|first2=Gary|last3=Beber|first3=Grace|title=Parsing the Turing Test:Philosophical and Methodological Issues in the Quest for the Thinking Computer|date=2008|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-4020-6710-5|page=65|url=https://books.google.com/?id=aggUJL_5_oQC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref> As for the second suggestion Turing makes, it has been likened by some authors as a call to finding a [[simulacrum]] of human cognitive development.<ref name=\"ParsingTT2008\"/> And such attempts at finding the underlying algorithms by which children learn of the features of the world around them are only beginning to be made.<ref name=\"ParsingTT2008\"/><ref>{{cite book|last1=Gopnik|first1=Alison|last2=Meltzoff.|first2=Andrew N.|title=Words, thoughts, and theories.|date=1997|publisher=MIT Press|url=http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/words-thoughts-and-theories}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Meltzoff|first1=Andrew N.|title=Origins of theory of mind, cognition and communication.|journal=Journal of Communication Disorders|date=1999|volume=32|issue=4|pages=251\u2013269|url=http://ilabs.washington.edu/meltzoff/pdf/99Meltzoff_JCommDisord.pdf|doi=10.1016/S0021-9924(99)00009-X|pmid=10466097|pmc=3629913}}</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{Citation | first = Rodney | last = Brooks | title = Elephants Don't Play Chess | journal = Robotics and Autonomous Systems | volume=6 | issue = 1\u20132 | year =1990 | pages = 3\u201315 | author-link=Rodney Brooks | url=http://people.csail.mit.edu/brooks/papers/elephants.pdf | accessdate=2007-08-30 | doi = 10.1016/S0921-8890(05)80025-9| citeseerx = 10.1.1.588.7539 }}\n* {{Crevier 1993}}\n* {{Citation | last = Dreyfus | first = Hubert  | title = What Computers Can't Do | year =1972 | publisher = MIT Press | location = New York | authorlink = Hubert Dreyfus | isbn = 978-0-06-011082-6 | title-link = What Computers Can't Do  }}\n* {{Citation | last = Dreyfus | first = Hubert | last2 = Dreyfus | first2 = Stuart | year = 1986 | title = Mind over Machine: The Power of Human Intuition and Expertise in the Era of the Computer | publisher = Blackwell | location = Oxford, UK | authorlink = Hubert Dreyfus }}\n* {{Citation | last = Dreyfus | first = Hubert  | title = What Computers ''Still'' Can't Do | year =1979 | publisher = MIT Press | location = New York | authorlink = Hubert Dreyfus }}.\n* {{Citation | doi = 10.1016/j.artmed.2008.08.008 | last = Harnad | first = Stevan | last2 = Scherzer | first2 = Peter  | title = First, Scale Up to the Robotic Turing Test, Then Worry About Feeling | journal = Artificial Intelligence in Medicine | volume = 44 | issue = 2 | year = 2008 | pages = 83\u20139 | author-link=Stevan Harnad | url=http://eprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/14430/ | pmid = 18930641 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.115.4269 }}.\n* {{Citation | first = John | last = Haugeland | year = 1985 | title = Artificial Intelligence: The Very Idea | publisher=MIT Press | author-link = John Haugeland| location= Cambridge, Mass.}}.\n* {{Citation | first = Hans | last = Moravec | year = 1976 | url = http://www.frc.ri.cmu.edu/users/hpm/project.archive/general.articles/1975/Raw.Power.html | title = The Role of Raw Power in Intelligence | author-link = Hans Moravec | access-date = 7 November 2007 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160303232511/http://www.frc.ri.cmu.edu/users/hpm/project.archive/general.articles/1975/Raw.Power.html | archive-date = 3 March 2016 | url-status = dead }}\n* {{Russell Norvig 2003}}\n* {{Citation | doi= 10.1017/S0140525X00005756 | first= John| last= Searle | url = http://members.aol.com/NeoNoetics/MindsBrainsPrograms.html  | title = Minds, Brains and Programs | journal = Behavioral and Brain Sciences | volume = 3| issue = 3| pages= 417\u2013457 | year = 1980 | author-link=John Searle}}\n* {{Citation | last = Turing | first = Alan | title = Computing Machinery and Intelligence | journal=Mind | volume = LIX | issue = 236 |date = October 1950| pages= 433\u2013460 | url = https://www.csee.umbc.edu/courses/471/papers/turing.pdf| authorlink = Alan Turing | doi=10.1093/mind/LIX.236.433}}\n* Saygin, A.

In humans, the pear-shaped gallbladder lies beneath the [[liver]], although the structure and position of the gallbladder can vary significantly among animal species. It receives and stores bile, produced by the liver, via the [[common hepatic duct]] and releases it via the [[common bile duct]] into the [[duodenum]], where the bile helps in the digestion of [[fat]]s.\n\nThe gallbladder can be affected by [[gallstone]]s, formed by material that cannot be dissolved \u2013 usually [[cholesterol]] or [[bilirubin]], a product of [[haemoglobin]] breakdown. These may cause significant pain, particularly in the upper-right corner of the abdomen, and are often treated with removal of the gallbladder called a [[cholecystectomy]] ('''cholecyst''' means gallbladder). [[Cholecystitis]], inflammation of the gallbladder, has a wide range of causes, including result from the impaction of gallstones, infection, and autoimmune disease.\n\n== Structure ==\nThe gallbladder is a hollow [[Organ (anatomy)|organ]] that sits in a shallow depression below the right lobe of the [[liver]], that is grey-blue in life.{{sfn|Gray's Anatomy|2008|p=1187-81}} In adults, the gallbladder measures approximately {{convert|7|to|10|cm|abbr=off}} in length and {{convert|4|cm|in}} in diameter when fully distended.<ref name=\"meilstrup\">{{cite book |author=Jon W.

The bile [[Emulsion|emulsifies]] fats in partly digested food, thereby assisting their absorption.

In humans, the pear-shaped gallbladder lies beneath the [[liver]], although the structure and position of the gallbladder can vary significantly among animal species. It receives and stores bile, produced by the liver, via the [[common hepatic duct]] and releases it via the [[common bile duct]] into the [[duodenum]], where the bile helps in the digestion of [[fat]]s.\n\nThe gallbladder can be affected by [[gallstone]]s, formed by material that cannot be dissolved \u2013 usually [[cholesterol]] or [[bilirubin]], a product of [[haemoglobin]] breakdown. These may cause significant pain, particularly in the upper-right corner of the abdomen, and are often treated with removal of the gallbladder called a [[cholecystectomy]] ('''cholecyst''' means gallbladder).

Sections of this [[foregut]] begin to differentiate into the organs of the gastrointestinal tract, such as the [[esophagus]], [[stomach]], and [[intestine]]s.<ref name= LARSEN2009 />\n\nDuring the fourth week of embryological development, the stomach rotates. The stomach, originally lying in the midline of the embryo, rotates so that its body is on the left. This rotation also affects the part of the gastrointestinal tube immediately below the stomach, which will go on to become the [[duodenum]]. By the end of the fourth week, the developing duodenum begins to spout a small outpouching on its right side, the [[hepatic diverticulum]], which will go on to become the [[hepatobiliary system|biliary tree]]. Just below this is a second outpouching, known as the ''cystic diverticulum'', that will eventually develop into the gallbladder.<ref name=LARSEN2009>{{cite book|author=Gary C.

Produced by the liver, bile flows through small vessels into the larger [[hepatic duct]]s and ultimately through the [[cystic duct]] (parts of the [[biliary tree]]) into the gallbladder, where it is stored. At any one time, {{convert|30|to|60|ml|usoz}} of bile is stored within the gallbladder.<ref name=PHYSIOLOGY2005 />\n\nWhen food containing fat enters the [[Gastrointestinal tract|digestive tract]], it stimulates the [[secretion]] of [[cholecystokinin]] (CCK) from [[I cell]]s of the duodenum and jejunum. In response to cholecystokinin, the gallbladder rhythmically contracts and releases its contents into the [[common bile duct]], eventually draining into the [[duodenum]]. The bile [[Emulsion|emulsifies]] fats in partly digested food, thereby assisting their absorption. Bile consists primarily of water and [[bile salt]]s, and also acts as a means of eliminating [[bilirubin]], a product of [[hemoglobin]] metabolism, from the body.<ref name=PHYSIOLOGY2005 />\n\nThe bile that is secreted by the liver and stored in the gallbladder is not the same as the bile that is secreted by the gallbladder.

It is most commonly an [[iatrogenic]] complication of [[cholecystectomy]] \u2014 surgical removal of [[gall bladder]], but can also be caused by other operations or by [[major trauma]]. The risk of biliary injury is more during laparoscopic cholecystectomy than during open cholecystectomy. Biliary injury may lead to several complications and may even cause death if not diagnosed in time and managed properly. Ideally biliary injury should be managed at a center with facilities and expertise in [[endoscopy]], [[radiology]] and surgery.<ref>{{citation | author=VK Kapoor | title=Bile duct injury repair: when? what? who? | journal=Journal of Hepato-Biliary-Pancreatic Surgery | volume=14 | issue=5 | pages=476\u2013479 | pmid=17909716 | doi=10.1007/s00534-007-1220-y}}</ref>\n\nBiloma is collection of [[bile]] within the [[abdominal cavity]].

He has played in the Premier League and [[English Football League]] for Newcastle United, [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]], [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]]. \n\nCarroll started his professional career with Newcastle United in 2006, before spending a brief period on loan with Preston North End, during which time he scored his first league goal. He established himself as a regular in the Newcastle first team by 2008, and following Newcastle's relegation from the Premier League to the [[EFL Championship|Championship]] in 2009, scored 17 goals in 39 appearances to help Newcastle finish first in the league, earning immediate promotion back to the Premier League in the process. He continued to play for Newcastle in the Premier League, scoring 11 goals in 19 appearances.\n\nOn 31 January 2011, the last day of that month's [[transfer window]], Carroll signed for Liverpool for a fee of \u00a335&nbsp;million, at the time the highest amount paid for a British footballer. He was bought to replace [[Fernando Torres]], who moved from Liverpool to [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] on the same day for a fee of \u00a350&nbsp;million. An injury sustained in December delayed Carroll's Liverpool debut until March 2011, and he scored his first two goals for his new club in April 2011 in a 3\u20130 victory over [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]]. In August 2012, Liverpool agreed a \u00a32&nbsp;million loan deal that would see him spend a season-long loan at West Ham United. This move was made permanent in June 2013 for a fee of \u00a315&nbsp;million. He spent six injury-impacted years at West Ham, and was released in 2019 at the end of his contract. That August, as a free agent, Carroll re-signed with his boyhood club Newcastle. \n\nCarroll played nine matches for England between 2010 and 2012, scoring twice, including one goal at [[UEFA Euro 2012]].\n\n==Club career==\n===Newcastle United===\n====2006\u201307====\n[[File:Andy Carroll - April 2010.jpg|thumb|upright|Carroll playing for [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] in 2010]]\n\nCarroll, an occasional scorer in [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]]'s [[Newcastle United F.C.

He has played in the Premier League and [[English Football League]] for Newcastle United, [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]], [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]]. \n\nCarroll started his professional career with Newcastle United in 2006, before spending a brief period on loan with Preston North End, during which time he scored his first league goal. He established himself as a regular in the Newcastle first team by 2008, and following Newcastle's relegation from the Premier League to the [[EFL Championship|Championship]] in 2009, scored 17 goals in 39 appearances to help Newcastle finish first in the league, earning immediate promotion back to the Premier League in the process. He continued to play for Newcastle in the Premier League, scoring 11 goals in 19 appearances.\n\nOn 31 January 2011, the last day of that month's [[transfer window]], Carroll signed for Liverpool for a fee of \u00a335&nbsp;million, at the time the highest amount paid for a British footballer. He was bought to replace [[Fernando Torres]], who moved from Liverpool to [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] on the same day for a fee of \u00a350&nbsp;million. An injury sustained in December delayed Carroll's Liverpool debut until March 2011, and he scored his first two goals for his new club in April 2011 in a 3\u20130 victory over [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]]. In August 2012, Liverpool agreed a \u00a32&nbsp;million loan deal that would see him spend a season-long loan at West Ham United. This move was made permanent in June 2013 for a fee of \u00a315&nbsp;million. He spent six injury-impacted years at West Ham, and was released in 2019 at the end of his contract. That August, as a free agent, Carroll re-signed with his boyhood club Newcastle. \n\nCarroll played nine matches for England between 2010 and 2012, scoring twice, including one goal at [[UEFA Euro 2012]].\n\n==Club career==\n===Newcastle United===\n====2006\u201307====\n[[File:Andy Carroll - April 2010.jpg|thumb|upright|Carroll playing for [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] in 2010]]\n\nCarroll, an occasional scorer in [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]]'s [[Newcastle United F.C.

pop culture and news series created by American [[YouTube]] personality, [[Philip DeFranco]], and his main claim to fame. The show has gone through several schedule changes through its lifetime, but as of 2019, airs weekly, Monday through Thursday. The first video with ''The Philip DeFranco Show'' included in its intro was uploaded on June 21, 2007. As DeFranco became increasingly popular, he signed with [[Revision3]], which would eventually acquire all of DeFranco's assets, including the ''PDS''. ''The Philip DeFranco Show'' has been sponsored by [[Netflix]], [[Ting (cell phone company)|Ting]], and [[State Farm]]. The show has been nominated for and has won several awards that focus on internet culture and web series. As of 2017 Philip DeFranco purchased his assets back from [[Group Nine Media|Group Nine]] (the company that replaced [[Discovery Digital Networks]]) and the Philip DeFranco show is now a part of the Philip DeFranco Network and produced by Rogue Rocket, DeFranco's production company.\n\n==Format==\nThe show is recorded by DeFranco in his production office in [[Woodland Hills, Los Angeles]].<ref name=BTSLATimes/> The ''PDS'' is then edited by James Girardier so that the episode is presented in a fast paced vlog format, complemented with use of frequent jump cuts throughout.<ref name=BTSLATimes/><ref name=LATimes/><ref>{{cite news|last=Jaworski|first=Michelle|url=http://www.dailydot.com/entertainment/philip-defranco-shark-week-interview/|title=YouTube's Philip DeFranco braves dangerous new waters for Shark Week|work=The Daily Dot|date=August 13, 2012|accessdate=June 15, 2013}}</ref> The topics discussed in the show vary, but usually cover pop culture and news.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Humphrey|first=Michael|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelhumphrey/2012/07/27/youtube-primetime-philip-defrancos-people-first-plan-has-sourcefed-booming/|title=YouTube PrimeTime: Philip DeFranco's 'People First' Plan Has SourceFed Booming|magazine=Forbes|date=July 27, 2012|accessdate=June 15, 2013}}</ref> Episodes usually have a 10-minute duration in which Defranco lists both arguments of a story and then states his opinion.<ref name=LATimes/> During the show's early existence, in 2007, DeFranco stated that he usually searches websites such as [[Technorati]] to find topics to discuss.<ref>{{cite news|last=Ratner|first=Andrew|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2007-09-23/news/0709220310_1_youtube-video-bloggers|title=For 1 college video blogger, it's a really strange trip|newspaper=The Baltimore Sun|date=September 23, 2007|accessdate=June 13, 2013}}</ref> Episodes of the series include recurring segments, such as the \"Douchebag of the Day\" segment and \"Today in Awesome.\"<ref>{{cite web|author=Rayne|url=http://www.mindcryme.com/2009/08/21/sxephil-a-little-news-a-little-sarcasm-and-your-douchebag-of-the-day/|title=sxePhil: A Little News, A Little Sarcasm, and Your Douchebag of the Day|publisher=Mind Cryme|date=August 21, 2009|accessdate=November 26, 2013}}</ref>\n\nSome of the older episodes have been noted to include racy thumbnails, such as ''Big Boobs and You''.<ref>{{cite news|last=Sarno|first=David|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/oct/14/entertainment/ca-webscout14|title=The bait is sexy; be prepared for a switch|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=October 14, 2007|accessdate=June 13, 2013}}</ref> As of June 2013, the video now holds a thumbnail of DeFranco speaking.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=big+boobs+and+you&oq=big+boobs+and+you&gs_l=youtube.3...1873918.1876215.0.1876296.17.17.0.0.0.0.203.1898.5j10j1.16.0...0.0...1ac.1.11.youtube.8xWrx1Hzeeo|title=''big boobs and you'' search query|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=June 13, 2013}}</ref> The video was chosen as one of DeFranco's top five YouTube moments by ''New Media Rockstars''.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Klima|first=Jeff|url=http://newmediarockstars.com/2014/01/phil-defranco-to-retire-the-top-5-phil-defranco-moments-on-youtube/|title=PHIL DEFRANCO TO RETIRE?

The mask forms a sealed cove and mouth, but may also cover the eyes and other vulnerable soft tissues of the face. Most gas masks are also [[respirator]]s, though the word ''gas mask'' is often used to refer to military equipment (such as a field protective mask). The gas mask only protects the user from digesting, inhaling and contact through the eyes (many agents affect through eye contact). Most combined gas mask filters will last around 8 hours in a nuclear biological chemical (NBC) situation. Chemical specific filters can last up to 20 hours in an NBC situation.\n\nAirborne toxic materials may be gaseous (for example, [[mustard gas]] and [[Chlorine|chlorine gas]]) or particulates (such as [[biological warfare|biological agents]]). Many gas masks include protection from both types. Gas masks are used in construction to protect against welding fumes, in demolition to protect against [[asbestos]] or other hazardous particles, and in the chemical industry when handling [[hazardous materials]], as in making repairs to leaking equipment or cleaning up after spills; workers are usually issued gas masks as a precaution against leaks.\n\nDuring demonstrations and protests where [[tear gas]] or [[CS gas]] is employed by riot police, gas masks are commonly used by police and demonstrators alike. Aside from serving their functional purposes, gas masks are also used as emblems in [[industrial music]], with the most notable example, the [[subgenre]] of [[drum and bass]] called [[neurofunk]]. These emblems are used by [[graffiti]] taggers because the mask protects them from the paint canister's [[toxic|toxic fumes]], and by [[Urban exploration|urban explorers]] venturing into environments where hazardous materials, such as asbestos, may be present.\n\nThe traditional gas mask style with two small circular eye windows originated when the only suitable material for these eye windows was [[glass]] or [[Poly(methyl methacrylate)|acrylic]]; as glass is notoriously brittle, glass eye windows had to be kept small and thick. Later, the discovery of [[polycarbonate]] allowed for gas masks to have a panoramic lens although the gas mask did not see this implemented until a long time after polycarbonate began to be used for gas mask lenses. Polycarbonate meant that lenses could be larger and so enabled a larger field of view.  Some have one or two filters screwed (via inlets) onto to the gas mask while others have a large filter (coffee can filter) connected to the gas mask with a hose that is sometimes confused with an ''air-supplied'' ''respirator'' in which an alternate supply of fresh air (oxygen tanks) is delivered.\n\n==Principles of construction==\n[[Absorption (chemistry)|Absorption]] is the process of being drawn into a (usually larger) body or substrate, and [[adsorption]] is the process of deposition upon a surface. This can be used to remove both particulate and gaseous hazards.  Although some form of [[chemical reaction|reaction]] may take place, it is not necessary; the method may work by attractive [[electric charge|charges]]. For example, if the target particles are positively charged, a negatively charged substrate may be used. Examples of substrates include [[activated carbon]], and [[zeolite]]s. This effect can be very simple and highly effective, for example using a damp cloth to cover the mouth and nose while escaping a fire.  While this method can be effective at trapping particulates produced by combustion, it does not filter out harmful gases which may be toxic or which displace the oxygen required for survival.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:US Navy gas mask exercise 021015-N-6996M-589.jpg|US Navy MCU-2/P gas mask system.\nFile:Gas mask 501556 fh000007.jpg|Gas mask used by the French military. The filter cartridge is connected via a flexible hose.\nFile:Gas mask greek.jpg|Greek Infantry with US [[M17 gas mask]]s\n</gallery>\n\n===Safety of old gas masks===\nGas masks have a limited useful lifespan that is related to the absorbent capacity of the filter. Once the filter has been saturated with hazardous chemicals, it ceases to provide protection and the user may be injured. Most gas masks use sealing caps over the air intake and are stored in vacuum sealed bags to prevent the filter from degrading before use, but the protective abilities also degrade as the filter ages or if it is exposed to moisture and heat. Very old unused gas mask filters from World War II may not be effective at all in protecting the user, and can even potentially cause harm to the user due to long-term changes in the filter chemical composition.\n[[File:2 Gasmaskenfilter.jpg|thumb|An asbestos-containing Russian GP-5 filter and a safe modern one in comparison.]]\n\nWorld War II gas masks contained [[chrysotile asbestos]] or [[Riebeckite#Crocidolite_(fibrous_riebeckite)|crocidolite asbestos]] in their filters.<ref>{{Cite news| last = Burns| first = Judith| title = Ban wartime gas masks, schools told| work = BBC News| accessdate = 2018-08-21| date = 2014-05-13| url = https://www.bbc.com/news/education-27391955}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book| publisher = Springer Science & Business Media| isbn = 978-1-4612-2496-9| last1 = Dail| first1 = David H.| last2 = Hammar| first2 = Samuel P.| last3 = Colby| first3 = Thomas V.| title = Pulmonary Pathology \u2014 Tumors| date = 2012-12-06 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wSgyBwAAQBAJ&pg=PT1005}}</ref> It is unknown how long for certain the materials were used in filters. Breathing blue asbestos in the factories resulted in the death of 10 percent of the workforce due to pleural and [[peritoneal mesothelioma]].

Although the filter is made so that the asbestos fibres cannot be breathed in if the filter layer is not damaged, these expired filters and others should be avoided for risk of health. All Russian [[Cold War]] period gas mask filters contain asbestos and should be avoided{{citation_needed|date=May 2019}}.\n\nModern gas masks are quite safe and do not use asbestos, but it is still important to be careful when using a modern gas mask. Typically, masks using 40&nbsp;mm connections are a more recent design. Rubber degrades with time, so new in-box \"modern type\" masks can be [[ozone cracking|cracked]] and leak. Also, the US C2 canister (black) was shown to contain [[hexavalent chromium]]: the studies by the [[U.S. Army Chemical Corps]] showed that the levels in the filter were acceptable, but imply caution when using, as it is a [[carcinogen]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\n=== Filter classification ===\n\nThe filter is selected according to the toxic compound.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.draeger.com/media/10/01/09/10010967/guide_for_selection_and_use_of_filtering_devices_9045782_en.pdf|title=Guide for selection and use of filtering devices|format=PDF|publisher=draeger.com|access-date=2013-02-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120526013417/http://www.draeger.com/media/10/01/09/10010967/guide_for_selection_and_use_of_filtering_devices_9045782_en.pdf|archive-date=2012-05-26|url-status=dead}}</ref> Each filter type protects against a particular hazard:\n\n* AX - Low-boiling (\u226465&nbsp;\u00b0C) organic compounds\n* A - High-boiling (>65&nbsp;\u00b0C) organic compounds\n* B - Inorganic gases ([[hydrogen sulfide]], [[chlorine]], [[hydrogen cyanide]])\n* E - [[Sulfur dioxide]] and [[hydrogen chloride]] (acidic gases)\n* K - [[Ammonia]] and [[amine]]s\n* CO - [[Carbon monoxide]]\n* Hg - [[mercury (element)|Mercury]]\n* Reactor - [[Iodine]] and [[methyl iodide]] (radioactive)\n* P - Particles; classified as P1, P2, and P3 according to removal efficiency\n* ABEK, ABEK-P3, ABEK-HgP3 or other combination filters against multiple hazards\n*A2B2E2K2-P3 is the highest rating of filter and filters all known chemical, biological substances as well as Alpha and Beta radiation. This excludes Carbon Monoxide and Carbon dioxide\n\nParticle filters are often included, because in many cases, the hazardous materials are in the form of mist, which is captured already by the particle filter before entering the chemical adsorber. Filtration may be aided with an air pump to improve wearer comfort. Filtration of air is only possible if there is sufficient oxygen in the first place. Thus, when handling [[asphyxiant]]s, or when ventilation is poor or the hazards are unknown, filtration is not possible and air must be supplied (with a SCBA system) from a pressurized bottle as in scuba diving.\n\n== Use ==\n[[File:Monmouth Regimental Museum - QRpedia 5.JPG|thumb|A 1939 Second World War-era baby's gas mask in [[Monmouth Regimental Museum]]. This design covered the whole of the baby except for its legs.]] \nA modern mask typically is constructed of an elastic polymer in various sizes. It is fitted with various adjustable straps which may be tightened to secure a good fit. Crucially, it is connected to a filter cartridge near the mouth either directly, or via a flexible hose. Some models contain drinking tubes which may be connected to a water bottle. Corrective lens inserts are also available for users who require them.\n\nMasks are typically tested for fit before use. After a mask is fitted, it is often tested by various challenge agents. [[Isoamyl acetate]], a synthetic banana flavourant, and [[camphor]] are often used as innocuous challenge agents. In the military, [[teargas]]es such as [[CN gas|CN]], [[CS gas|CS]], and [[stannic chloride]] in a chamber may be used to give the users confidence in the efficiency of the mask.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.af.mil/shared/media/epubs/AFMAN32-4006.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-07-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020175705/http://www.af.mil/shared/media/epubs/AFMAN32-4006.pdf |archive-date=2012-10-20 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n{{Further information| MOPP (protective gear) | NBC suit}}\n\n==Reaction and exchange==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}\n\nThis principle relies on substances harmful to humans being usually more reactive than air. This method of separation will use some form of generally reactive substance (for example an [[acid]]) coating or supported by some solid material. An example is [[synthetic resin]]s. These can be created with different groups of [[atom]]s (usually called [[functional group]]s) that have different properties. Thus a resin can be tailored to a particular toxic group. When the reactive substance comes in contact with the resin, it will bond to it, removing it from the air stream. It may also exchange with a less harmful substance at this site.\n\nThough it was crude, the [[hypo helmet]] was a stopgap measure for British troops in the trenches that offered at least some protection during a gas attack. As the months passed and poison gas was used more often, more sophisticated gas masks were developed and introduced. There are two main difficulties with gas mask design:\n\n*The user may be exposed to many types of toxic material. Military personnel are especially prone to being exposed to a diverse range of toxic gases. However, if the mask is for a particular use (such as the protection from a specific toxic material in a factory), then the design can be much simpler and the cost lower.\n*The protection will wear off over time. Filters will clog up, substrates for absorption will fill up, and reactive filters will run out of reactive substances. Thus the user only has protection for a limited time, and then he must either replace the filter device in the mask, or use a new mask.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Humboldt gasmask 1799.jpg|A primitive respirator was designed by [[Alexander von Humboldt]] in 1799 for underground mining\nFile:Various gas masks WWI.jpg|Various gas masks employed on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] and [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]] during World War I\nFile:1930s gas mask.jpg|[[Finland|Finnish]] civilian gas mask from 1939.

The main improvement was replacing the separate filter canister connected with a hose by a filter canister screwed on the side of the gas mask, that could be replaced easily. Also, it had replaceable plastic lenses, much helping vision.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=0SkDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA74&dq=true#v=onepage&q=true&f=true \"Gas Mask Weighing Half As Much.\"] ''Popular Sciences'', March 1944, p. 74.</ref>\n\nGas mask development since has mirrored the development of chemical agents in warfare, filling the need to protect against ever more deadly threats, biological weapons, and radioactive dust in the nuclear era. However, where agents that cause harm through contact or penetration of the skin occurs, such as [[blister agent]] or [[nerve agent]], a gas mask alone is not sufficient protection, and full protective clothing must be worn in addition, to protect from contact with the atmosphere. For reasons of civil defense and personal protection, individuals often buy gas masks believing that they protect against the harmful effects of an attack with nuclear, biological, or chemical ([[Chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear|NBC]]) agents; which is only partially true, as gas masks protect only against respiratory absorption. Whilst most military gas masks are designed to be capable of protection against all NBC agents, they can have filter canisters proof against those agents (heavier) or only against [[riot control agent]]s and smoke (lighter, and often used for training purposes); likewise there are lightweight masks solely for use in riot control agents and not for NBC situations.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nAlthough thorough training and the availability of gas masks and other protective equipment can nullify the casualty-causing effects of an attack by chemical agents, troops who are forced to operate in full protective gear are less efficient in completing tasks, tire easily, and may be affected psychologically by the threat of attack by these weapons. During the [[Cold War]] era, it was seen as inevitable that there would be a constant NBC threat on the battlefield, and thus troops needed protection in which they could remain fully functional; thus protective gear, and especially gas masks have evolved to incorporate innovations in terms of increasing user-comfort, and in compatibility with other equipment (from drinking devices to artificial respiration tubes, to communications systems etc.). The gas mask has thus now arrived at a 'fourth generation' of development.\n\n[[File:Chemical weapon1.jpg|thumb|Iranian soldier wearing gas mask on the front-line of the [[Iran\u2013Iraq War]]]]\nDuring the [[Iran\u2013Iraq War]] (1980\u201388), Iraq developed [[Iraqi chemical weapons program|its chemical weapons program]] with the help of Europeans countries (such as Germany and France) {{cn|date=March 2019}}, and used them large-scale against Iranians as well as against Iraqi Kurds. Iran was unprepared for chemical warfare. In 1984, Iran received gas masks from the [[Republic of Korea]] and [[East Germany]], but the Korean masks were not suited for the faces of non-[[East Asian people]] and the filter only lasted for 15 minutes, and the 5,000 masks bought from East Germany proved to be not gas masks but spray painting goggles. As late as 1986, Iranian diplomats still traveled in Europe to buy [[active charcoal]] and models of filters in order to produce defensive gear domestically. In April 1988, Iran started domestic production of gas masks by the Iran Yasa factories.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cns.miis.edu/archive/cns/programs/dc/briefs/030701.htm |title=Iranian Use of Chemical Weapons: A Critical Analysis of Past Allegations |last=Zanders |first=Jean Pascal |date=March 7, 2001 |website=CNS Briefings |publisher=James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies |access-date=27 March 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150320222016/http://cns.miis.edu/archive/cns/programs/dc/briefs/030701.htm |archivedate=March 20, 2015 }}</ref>\n\n==In schools==\n[[File:Viktor Billa Oborona pionerov.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Pioneer movement|Pioneers]] in gas masks.

Schools would implement gas mask education and training after the outbreak of a war. Schools would harshly enforce the compulsory carrying of gas masks at all times. Gas mask and air raid drills were closely related and children would be made to wear gas masks in everyday activities, including gymnastics. The wearing of gas masks in the classrooms were especially difficult for teachers as they had trouble distinguishing one child from another. The gas masks became as uniform as the students' uniforms.

The mask forms a sealed cover over the nose and mouth, but may also cover the eyes and other vulnerable soft tissues of the face. Most gas masks are also [[respirator]]s, though the word ''gas mask'' is often used to refer to military equipment (such as a field protective mask). The gas mask only protects the user from digesting, inhaling and contact through the eyes (many agents affect through eye contact). Most combined gas mask filters will last around 8 hours in a nuclear biological chemical (NBC) situation. Chemical specific filters can last up to 20 hours in an NBC situation.\n\nAirborne toxic materials may be gaseous (for example, [[mustard gas]] and [[Chlorine|chlorine gas]]) or particulates (such as [[biological warfare|biological agents]]). Many gas masks include protection from both types. Gas masks are used in construction to protect against welding fumes, in demolition to protect against [[asbestos]] or other hazardous particles, and in the chemical industry when handling [[hazardous materials]], as in making repairs to leaking equipment or cleaning up after spills; workers are usually issued gas masks as a precaution against leaks.\n\nDuring demonstrations and protests where [[tear gas]] or [[CS gas]] is employed by riot police, gas masks are commonly used by police and demonstrators alike. Aside from serving their functional purposes, gas masks are also used as emblems in [[industrial music]], with the most notable example, the [[subgenre]] of [[drum and bass]] called [[neurofunk]]. These emblems are used by [[graffiti]] taggers because the mask protects them from the paint canister's [[toxic|toxic fumes]], and by [[Urban exploration|urban explorers]] venturing into environments where hazardous materials, such as asbestos, may be present.\n\nThe traditional gas mask style with two small circular eye windows originated when the only suitable material for these eye windows was [[glass]] or [[Poly(methyl methacrylate)|acrylic]]; as glass is notoriously brittle, glass eye windows had to be kept small and thick. Later, the discovery of [[polycarbonate]] allowed for gas masks to have a panoramic lens although the gas mask did not see this implemented until a long time after polycarbonate began to be used for gas mask lenses. Polycarbonate meant that lenses could be larger and so enabled a larger field of view.  Some have one or two filters screwed (via inlets) onto to the gas mask while others have a large filter (coffee can filter) connected to the gas mask with a hose that is sometimes confused with an ''air-supplied'' ''respirator'' in which an alternate supply of fresh air (oxygen tanks) is delivered.\n\n==Principles of construction==\n[[Absorption (chemistry)|Absorption]] is the process of being drawn into a (usually larger) body or substrate, and [[adsorption]] is the process of deposition upon a surface. This can be used to remove both particulate and gaseous hazards.  Although some form of [[chemical reaction|reaction]] may take place, it is not necessary; the method may work by attractive [[electric charge|charges]]. For example, if the target particles are positively charged, a negatively charged substrate may be used. Examples of substrates include [[activated carbon]], and [[zeolite]]s. This effect can be very simple and highly effective, for example using a damp cloth to cover the mouth and nose while escaping a fire.  While this method can be effective at trapping particulates produced by combustion, it does not filter out harmful gases which may be toxic or which displace the oxygen required for survival.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:US Navy gas mask exercise 021015-N-6996M-589.jpg|US Navy MCU-2/P gas mask system.\nFile:Gas mask 501556 fh000007.jpg|Gas mask used by the French military. The filter cartridge is connected via a flexible hose.\nFile:Gas mask greek.jpg|Greek Infantry with US [[M17 gas mask]]s\n</gallery>\n\n===Safety of old gas masks===\nGas masks have a limited useful lifespan that is related to the absorbent capacity of the filter. Once the filter has been saturated with hazardous chemicals, it ceases to provide protection and the user may be injured. Most gas masks use sealing caps over the air intake and are stored in vacuum sealed bags to prevent the filter from degrading before use, but the protective abilities also degrade as the filter ages or if it is exposed to moisture and heat. Very old unused gas mask filters from World War II may not be effective at all in protecting the user, and can even potentially cause harm to the user due to long-term changes in the filter chemical composition.\n[[File:2 Gasmaskenfilter.jpg|thumb|An asbestos-containing Russian GP-5 filter and a safe modern one in comparison.]]\n\nWorld War II gas masks contained [[chrysotile asbestos]] or [[Riebeckite#Crocidolite_(fibrous_riebeckite)|crocidolite asbestos]] in their filters.<ref>{{Cite news| last = Burns| first = Judith| title = Ban wartime gas masks, schools told| work = BBC News| accessdate = 2018-08-21| date = 2014-05-13| url = https://www.bbc.com/news/education-27391955}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book| publisher = Springer Science & Business Media| isbn = 978-1-4612-2496-9| last1 = Dail| first1 = David H.| last2 = Hammar| first2 = Samuel P.| last3 = Colby| first3 = Thomas V.| title = Pulmonary Pathology \u2014 Tumors| date = 2012-12-06 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wSgyBwAAQBAJ&pg=PT1005}}</ref> It is unknown how long for certain the materials were used in filters.

Although the filter is made so that the asbestos fibres cannot be breathed in if the filter layer is not damaged, these expired filters and others should be avoided for risk of health. All Russian [[Cold War]] period gas mask filters contain asbestos and should be avoided{{citation_needed|date=May 2019}}.\n\nModern gas masks are quite safe and do not use asbestos, but it is still important to be careful when using a modern gas mask. Typically, masks using 40&nbsp;mm connections are a more recent design. Rubber degrades with time, so new in-box \"modern type\" masks can be [[ozone cracking|cracked]] and leak. Also, the US C2 canister (black) was shown to contain [[hexavalent chromium]]: the studies by the [[U.S. Army Chemical Corps]] showed that the levels in the filter were acceptable, but imply caution when using, as it is a [[carcinogen]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\n=== Filter classification ===\n\nThe filter is selected according to the toxic compound.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.draeger.com/media/10/01/09/10010967/guide_for_selection_and_use_of_filtering_devices_9045782_en.pdf|title=Guide for selection and use of filtering devices|format=PDF|publisher=draeger.com|access-date=2013-02-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120526013417/http://www.draeger.com/media/10/01/09/10010967/guide_for_selection_and_use_of_filtering_devices_9045782_en.pdf|archive-date=2012-05-26|url-status=dead}}</ref> Each filter type protects against a particular hazard:\n\n* AX - Low-boiling (\u226465&nbsp;\u00b0C) organic compounds\n* A - High-boiling (>65&nbsp;\u00b0C) organic compounds\n* B - Inorganic gases ([[hydrogen sulfide]], [[chlorine]], [[hydrogen cyanide]])\n* E - [[Sulfur dioxide]] and [[hydrogen chloride]] (acidic gases)\n* K - [[Ammonia]] and [[amine]]s\n* CO - [[Carbon monoxide]]\n* Hg - [[mercury (element)|Mercury]]\n* Reactor - [[Iodine]] and [[methyl iodide]] (radioactive)\n* P - Particles; classified as P1, P2, and P3 according to removal efficiency\n* ABEK, ABEK-P3, ABEK-HgP3 or other combination filters against multiple hazards\n*A2B2E2K2-P3 is the highest rating of filter and filters all known chemical, biological substances as well as Alpha and Beta radiation. This excludes Carbon Monoxide and Carbon dioxide\n\nParticle filters are often included, because in many cases, the hazardous materials are in the form of mist, which is captured already by the particle filter before entering the chemical adsorber. Filtration may be aided with an air pump to improve wearer comfort. Filtration of air is only possible if there is sufficient oxygen in the first place. Thus, when handling [[asphyxiant]]s, or when ventilation is poor or the hazards are unknown, filtration is not possible and air must be supplied (with a SCBA system) from a pressurized bottle as in scuba diving.\n\n== Use ==\n[[File:Monmouth Regimental Museum - QRpedia 5.JPG|thumb|A 1939 Second World War-era baby's gas mask in [[Monmouth Regimental Museum]]. This design covered the whole of the baby except for its legs.]] \nA modern mask typically is constructed of an elastic polymer in various sizes. It is fitted with various adjustable straps which may be tightened to secure a good fit. Crucially, it is connected to a filter cartridge near the mouth either directly, or via a flexible hose. Some models contain drinking tubes which may be connected to a water bottle. Corrective lens inserts are also available for users who require them.\n\nMasks are typically tested for fit before use. After a mask is fitted, it is often tested by various challenge agents. [[Isoamyl acetate]], a synthetic banana flavourant, and [[camphor]] are often used as innocuous challenge agents. In the military, [[teargas]]es such as [[CN gas|CN]], [[CS gas|CS]], and [[stannic chloride]] in a chamber may be used to give the users confidence in the efficiency of the mask.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.af.mil/shared/media/epubs/AFMAN32-4006.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-07-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020175705/http://www.af.mil/shared/media/epubs/AFMAN32-4006.pdf |archive-date=2012-10-20 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n{{Further information| MOPP (protective gear) | NBC suit}}\n\n==Reaction and exchange==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}\n\nThis principle relies on substances harmful to humans being usually more reactive than air. This method of separation will use some form of generally reactive substance (for example an [[acid]]) coating or supported by some solid material. An example is [[synthetic resin]]s. These can be created with different groups of [[atom]]s (usually called [[functional group]]s) that have different properties. Thus a resin can be tailored to a particular toxic group. When the reactive substance comes in contact with the resin, it will bond to it, removing it from the air stream. It may also exchange with a less harmful substance at this site.\n\nThough it was crude, the [[hypo helmet]] was a stopgap measure for British troops in the trenches that offered at least some protection during a gas attack. As the months passed and poison gas was used more often, more sophisticated gas masks were developed and introduced. There are two main difficulties with gas mask design:\n\n*The user may be exposed to many types of toxic material. Military personnel are especially prone to being exposed to a diverse range of toxic gases. However, if the mask is for a particular use (such as the protection from a specific toxic material in a factory), then the design can be much simpler and the cost lower.\n*The protection will wear off over time. Filters will clog up, substrates for absorption will fill up, and reactive filters will run out of reactive substances. Thus the user only has protection for a limited time, and then he must either replace the filter device in the mask, or use a new mask.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Humboldt gasmask 1799.jpg|A primitive respirator was designed by [[Alexander von Humboldt]] in 1799 for underground mining\nFile:Various gas masks WWI.jpg|Various gas masks employed on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] and [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]] during World War I\nFile:1930s gas mask.jpg|[[Finland|Finnish]] civilian gas mask from 1939.

These waste materials were collected from the public in recycling programs to assist the war effort.<ref>''Once Worthless Things that have Suddenly Become of Value'', [[Popular Science]] monthly, December 1918, page 80, scanned by [https://books.google.com/books?id=EikDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA80 Google Books]</ref>\n\nThe first effective filtering [[activated charcoal]] gas mask in the world was invented in 1915 by Russian chemist [[Nikolay Zelinsky]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Kozhevnikov|first=A B|title=Stalin's great science: the times and adventures of Soviet physicists|url=https://books.google.com/?id=l1Ha_opwB68C|accessdate=2009-04-28|edition=illustrated, reprint|year=2004|publisher=Imperial College Press|isbn= 978-1-86094-419-2|pages=10\u201311}}</ref>\n\n[[File:BunkArt-Horse-Gas-Mask.jpg|thumb|First World War gas mask for horses]]\n[[Image:Soldaty 267 Duhovshinskogo polka.jpg|thumb|1916, Russian soldiers]]\nAlso in World War I, since dogs were frequently used on the front lines, a special type of gas mask was developed that dogs were trained to wear.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=EikDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA75 \"Gas-Masks for Dogs / Dumb Heroes of the Fighting Front\"], ''[[Popular Science]]'' monthly, December 1918, page 75, Scanned by Google Books</ref> Other gas masks were developed during World War I and the time following for horses in the various mounted units that operated near the front lines.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=LeADAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA75&dq=Popular+Science+1930+plane+%22Popular+Mechanics%22&hl=en&ei=JJlxTqniIc_AtgfAoMD-CQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCsQ6AEwADge#v=onepage&q&f=true \"Gas Masks to Guard Horses and Dogs in War\"] ''Popular Mechanics'', July 1934, bottom pg. 75</ref> In America thousands of gas masks were produced for American as well as Allied troops.

It was made of plastic and rubber-like material that greatly reduced the weight and bulk, compared to World War I gas masks and fitted the user's face more snugly and comfortably. The main improvement was replacing the separate filter canister connected with a hose by a filter canister screwed on the side of the gas mask, that could be replaced easily. Also, it had replaceable plastic lenses, much helping vision.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=0SkDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA74&dq=true#v=onepage&q=true&f=true \"Gas Mask Weighing Half As Much.\"] ''Popular Sciences'', March 1944, p. 74.</ref>\n\nGas mask development since has mirrored the development of chemical agents in warfare, filling the need to protect against ever more deadly threats, biological weapons, and radioactive dust in the nuclear era. However, where agents that cause harm through contact or penetration of the skin occurs, such as [[blister agent]] or [[nerve agent]], a gas mask alone is not sufficient protection, and full protective clothing must be worn in addition, to protect from contact with the atmosphere. For reasons of civil defense and personal protection, individuals often buy gas masks believing that they protect against the harmful effects of an attack with nuclear, biological, or chemical ([[Chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear|NBC]]) agents; which is only partially true, as gas masks protect only against respiratory absorption. Whilst most military gas masks are designed to be capable of protection against all NBC agents, they can have filter canisters proof against those agents (heavier) or only against [[riot control agent]]s and smoke (lighter, and often used for training purposes); likewise there are lightweight masks solely for use in riot control agents and not for NBC situations.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nAlthough thorough training and the availability of gas masks and other protective equipment can nullify the casualty-causing effects of an attack by chemical agents, troops who are forced to operate in full protective gear are less efficient in completing tasks, tire easily, and may be affected psychologically by the threat of attack by these weapons. During the [[Cold War]] era, it was seen as inevitable that there would be a constant NBC threat on the battlefield, and thus troops needed protection in which they could remain fully functional; thus protective gear, and especially gas masks have evolved to incorporate innovations in terms of increasing user-comfort, and in compatibility with other equipment (from drinking devices to artificial respiration tubes, to communications systems etc.). The gas mask has thus now arrived at a 'fourth generation' of development.\n\n[[File:Chemical weapon1.jpg|thumb|Iranian soldier wearing gas mask on the front-line of the [[Iran\u2013Iraq War]]]]\nDuring the [[Iran\u2013Iraq War]] (1980\u201388), Iraq developed [[Iraqi chemical weapons program|its chemical weapons program]] with the help of Europeans countries (such as Germany and France) {{cn|date=March 2019}}, and used them large-scale against Iranians as well as against Iraqi Kurds. Iran was unprepared for chemical warfare. In 1984, Iran received gas masks from the [[Republic of Korea]] and [[East Germany]], but the Korean masks were not suited for the faces of non-[[East Asian people]] and the filter only lasted for 15 minutes, and the 5,000 masks bought from East Germany proved to be not gas masks but spray painting goggles. As late as 1986, Iranian diplomats still traveled in Europe to buy [[active charcoal]] and models of filters in order to produce defensive gear domestically. In April 1988, Iran started domestic production of gas masks by the Iran Yasa factories.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cns.miis.edu/archive/cns/programs/dc/briefs/030701.htm |title=Iranian Use of Chemical Weapons: A Critical Analysis of Past Allegations |last=Zanders |first=Jean Pascal |date=March 7, 2001 |website=CNS Briefings |publisher=James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies |access-date=27 March 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150320222016/http://cns.miis.edu/archive/cns/programs/dc/briefs/030701.htm |archivedate=March 20, 2015 }}</ref>\n\n==In schools==\n[[File:Viktor Billa Oborona pionerov.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Pioneer movement|Pioneers]] in gas masks.

Schools would implement gas mask education and training after the outbreak of a war. Schools would harshly enforce the compulsory carrying of gas masks at all times. Gas mask and air raid drills were closely related and children would be made to wear gas masks in everyday activities, including gymnastics. The wearing of gas masks in the classrooms were especially difficult for teachers as they had trouble distinguishing one child from another. The gas masks became as uniform as the students' uniforms. Other civilians learned the use of a gas mask through posters, pamphlets, and radio lectures, but children learned through cartoons and rhymes such as \"[[coughs and sneezes spread diseases]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ant&AN=XANL668213267&site=ehost-live&scope=site|title=EBSCOhost Login|author=|date=|website=search.ebscohost.com|accessdate=25 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Respirator Assigned Protection Factors|Assigned Protection Factors]]\n* [[Cartridges and canisters of air-purifying respirators]]\n* [[GP-5 gas mask]]\n* [[Hopcalite]]\n* [[M2 Gas Mask]]\n* [[M40 Field Protective Mask]]\n* [[M50 joint service general purpose mask]]\n* [[C-4 Protective Mask]]\n* [[NBC suit]]\n* [[PH helmet]]\n* [[Plague doctor costume|Plague doctor's outfit]]\n* [[Respirator]]\n* [[Respirator fit test]]\n* [[Respirators testing in the workplaces]]\n* [[Smoke hood]]\n\n{{-}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{citation |ref=harv |last1=Wetherell |first1=Anthony |last2=Mathers |first2=George |year=2007 |contribution=Respiratory Protection |editor-last=Marrs |editor-first=Timothy |editor2-last=Maynard |editor2-first=Robert |editor3-last=Sidell |editor3-first=Frederick |title=Chemical Warfare Agents: Toxicology and Treatment|location=New York |publisher=Wiley |pages=157\u2013174 |isbn=978-0470013595}}\n* {{citation |ref=harv |last1=Mayer-Maguire |first1=Thomas |last2=Baker |first2=Brian |year=2015 |title=British Military Respirators and Anti-Gas Equipment of the Two World Wars |publisher=Crowood}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons|Gas mask}}\n*[http://science.howstuffworks.com/gas-mask.htm/printable How Stuff Works - Gas Masks] Science.com\n*[http://inventors.about.com/od/gstartinventions/a/gasmask.htm The History of Gas Masks] inventors.about.com, About, Inc. updated August 6, 2016\n*[https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/topics/respirators/factsheets/respfact.html Respirator Fact Sheet]\n*[https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/topics/respirators/cel/default.html CBRN SCBA NIOSH Approved Respirators] List of NIOSH Approved CBRN SCBA respirators\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Gas Mask}}\n[[Category:American inventions]]\n[[Category:British inventions]]\n[[Category:Iranian inventions]]\n[[Category:Science and technology in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Military personal equipment]]\n[[Category:1914 introductions]]\n[[Category:Riot control equipment]]\n[[Category:Gas masks|*Main]]\n", "name_user": "2a02:c7d:2884:c800:c433:43d0:5dd4:2247", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(Fixed typo)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_mask"}

The decision was met with derision in the French press and also led to Coupet's walking out of the national squad before the tournament, though he was to return one day later. The move was viewed by some as a desire to keep the veterans of France's 1998 World Cup victory on the team.

France is now one of only four nations (along with [[Italy national football team|Italy]], [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] and the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]]) to have shut Brazil out twice in the World Cup finals, and the first to have done it in consecutive matches, both times with Barthez in goal.<ref name=\"grado zero\"/>\n\nBarthez again kept another clean sheet \u2013 his fourth of the tournament<ref name=\"Behind the World Cup record\"/> \u2013 in the semi-final against [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] (with Zinedine Zidane's penalty shot the winning goal), though he appeared in questionable form.

He began competing at selected events in the [[Porsche Carrera Cup France]] that year with the team SOFREV Auto Sport Promotion. He also competed at two events in the THP Spider Cup. In 2009, he raced in a number of various motorsport series such as the [[French GT Championship]], Bioracing Series and the [[Caterham]] Sigma Cup France as well as the Porsche Carrera Cup France.

driver who played as a [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]]. At club level, he played football in both France and England with [[Toulouse FC|Toulouse]], [[Olympique de Marseille|Marseille]], [[AS Monaco FC|AS Monaco]], [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], and [[FC Nantes|Nantes]]. At international level, he represented the [[France national football team|France national team]], with whom he won the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]], [[UEFA Euro 2000]], and the [[2003 FIFA Confederations Cup]], representing his nation at a total of three editions of both the [[FIFA World Cup]] and the [[UEFA European Championship]]; he also reached the final of the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]], after which he retired from international football.\n\nNicknamed ''Le Divin Chauve'' (\"The Divine Bald One\"), due to his trademark shaved head,<ref name=\"Behind the World Cup record\"/><ref name=\"grado zero\"/><ref name=\"Barthez cries\"/> Barthez is France's most capped player in the [[FIFA World Cup]], with 17 appearances at the finals and shares the record for the most [[FIFA World Cup records#Goalkeeping|World Cup finals clean sheets]] with [[Peter Shilton]], with ten.<ref name=\"Behind the World Cup record\"/><ref name=\"grado zero\"/> In club football, he won the [[UEFA Champions League]] with Olympique Marseille in [[1992\u201393 UEFA Champions League|1993]] as well as several [[Ligue 1]] and [[Premier League]] titles. After retiring from football in 2007, Barthez began a career in motorsport in 2008.\n\n==Club career==\n\n===Marseille===\nBorn in [[Lavelanet]], France, Barthez made his first division debut for [[Toulouse FC|Toulouse]] on 21 September 1991, against [[AS Nancy|Nancy]]. He joined [[Olympique de Marseille|Marseille]] in 1992, and won both the French championship and the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] at the end of his first season in Marseille, keeping a clean sheet in a 1\u20130 victory over [[A.C. Milan]] in [[1993 UEFA Champions League Final|final of the latter competition]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/season=1992/matches/round=50/match=50054/postmatch/lineups/index.html|title=Marseille 1-0 Milan|publisher=UEFA.com|accessdate=16 January 2018}}</ref> The 1993 victory made him the youngest goalkeeper to win a Champions League title until [[Iker Casillas]] did so in 2000.\n\nMarseille, however, would be stripped of their domestic title, though not of the Champions League crown, due to their involvement in a domestic [[match fixing]] scandal, and a year later (1994) would suffer a forced relegation to the second division due to a related financial bankruptcy. He stayed with the club in Division 2 for the 1994\u201395 season despite many offers from elite French clubs, helping Marseille to the title and to earn promotion to the first division.<ref>{{cite web |first=Maxime |last=Dupuis |title=Barthez en dix dates |url=http://www.eurosport.fr/football/story_sto979355.shtml |work=Eurosport.fr |publisher=Eurosport |date=6 October 2006 |accessdate=28 April 2011 }}</ref>\n\n===Monaco===\nIn 1995, Barthez joined [[AS Monaco FC|AS Monaco]] and won [[Ligue 1]] titles in 1997 and 2000. He also played in [[Jean Tigana]]'s talented Monaco side which famously put his future club [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] out of the Champions League in 1998 on away goals after a 1\u20131 draw at [[Old Trafford (football)|Old Trafford]].<ref>{{cite news \n|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-monaco-and-bust-for-sorry-united-1151168.html\n|title=Monaco and bust for sorry United\n|newspaper=The Independent \n|date=19 March 1998 |accessdate=30 December 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Manchester United===\nAs a result of Barthez's success in the World Cup and the Euros, he caught the attention of Manchester United manager [[Alex Ferguson|Sir Alex Ferguson]], who was searching for a star goalkeeper to replace the recently departed [[Peter Schmeichel]], as Ferguson did not think that the previous season's goalkeeper, [[Mark Bosnich]], was a long-term replacement.

His first season was a triumph as he answered all the questions about how he would handle rainy [[Manchester]] compared to sunny [[Monaco]].

After dropping a cross from [[Robbie Keane]], Barthez deliberately kicked out with his foot at [[Ian Harte]], who fell to the ground on the edge of six yard box, and the referee awarded a penalty to Leeds.

Consequently, in the second half of the season, Barthez repaired his reputation with consistent, solid performances and the spectacular saves that he was famous for. His turn in fortunes was shown in a 2\u20132 draw with [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] at [[Pride Park Stadium|Pride Park]]. Derby forward [[Malcolm Christie]] looked to have sealed his [[List of Premier League hat-tricks|hat-trick]], but referee [[Steve Dunn (referee)|Steve Dunn]] controversially disallowed the goal, ruling that Christie kicked the ball out of Barthez's hands.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/1847978.stm |title=Derby thwart Man Utd |date=3 March 2002 |accessdate=3 January 2014 |work=BBC Sport |publisher=BBC}}</ref>\n\nHe was also noted for playing mind games before opposition players took a penalty. The first time this occurred was in November 2001 when [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] came to Old Trafford.

The decision was met with derision in the French press and also led to Coupet's walking out of the national squad before the tournament, though he was to return one day later. The move was viewed by some as a desire to keep the veterans of France's 1998 World Cup victory on the team.

France is now one of only four nations (along with [[Italy national football team|Italy]], [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] and the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]]) to have shut Brazil out twice in the World Cup finals, and the first to have done it in consecutive matches, both times with Barthez in goal.<ref name=\"grado zero\"/>\n\nBarthez again kept another clean sheet \u2013 his fourth of the tournament<ref name=\"Behind the World Cup record\"/> \u2013 in the semi-final against [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] (with Zinedine Zidane's penalty shot the winning goal), though he appeared in questionable form.

He began competing at selected events in the [[Porsche Carrera Cup France]] that year with the team SOFREV Auto Sport Promotion. He also competed at two events in the THP Spider Cup. In 2009, he raced in a number of various motorsport series such as the [[French GT Championship]], Bioracing Series and the [[Caterham]] Sigma Cup France as well as the Porsche Carrera Cup France.
