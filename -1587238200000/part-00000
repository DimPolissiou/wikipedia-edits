It is believed that hostilities among the inlanders of Malaita forced some people into the lagoon where over time they built their islands on sandbars after diving for coral. The religion of the island was based on prayers and offerings to the ghosts of dead ancestors, mediated by priests who kept their skulls and relics in tabu houses. Some ancestors were incarnated as sharks which protected their descendants. Langalanga is also the main source of the [[shell money]] now made in Solomon Islands.\n\n==History==\n\nIn Malaita legend, the first settlement on the island began around 3,000 BC at a place called Siale. The first places in the Malaita area to be settled were ''Dukwasi'' (Kwara'ae speaking people), and the ''Asi'' (man-made islands) namely: Aoke, Kaloka and Rarata in Langa Langa lagoon, Laulasi, Alite Koalia and Gwa'ata&nbsp;\u2013 Ta'alulolo.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\nIt is also believed the early settlers originated from Mt. Kolovrat (Alasa'a), the highest peak on the main Malaita Island. The early settlers were believed to be castaways from the Alasa'a community. Some said they chose not to return to Alasa\u00b4a because of the distance. It is an approximately two days walk. And the main reason why they came is to fish and in search for other sea foods in the island of Launasi meaning \u00b4\u00b4I'm stuck\u00b4\u00b4now known as Laulasi. From then they named the island Launasi in relation to the expression.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\nAfter they had settled, other people began to arrive from different parts of Malaita and outside to settle in the Langalanga lagoon. They came from Small Malaita, Florida (Ngella), some came from the northern part of Guadalcanal believed to be from Longuvalasi area and others from the northern region of Malaita. Through inter-marriages, their descendants spread to the whole of the Langalanga lagoon. Certain cultural features or ''Tambu House'' (Place of the first settlements) are still preserved which attest to the settlement patterns that were made.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n[[File:LaulasiIslandSolomonISlandsPart1video.webm|thumb|150px |Part 1 Documentary Video]]\n[[File:LaulasiIslandPart2higher.webm|thumb|150px |Part 2 Documentary Video]]\n\n==1800 to 1900==\n\nIn 1892 the [[Queensland]] government Australia abandoned the Pacific labour trade known as [[Blackbirding]] and in 1901 the Commonwealth of Australia enacted the [[Pacific Island Labourers Act 1901]] which facilitated the deportation of Pacific Islanders that was the precursor to the [[White Australia policy]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\nBritain was provided with a \"plausible excuse for protecting the Solomons\" and so protecting their labour reserves.

Boys are separated from their parents when they are around 12 or 13 years old to live separate in the men's houses.

It can be said that it is unique to the constituency. In the early stages people used to build dingies. Later, with improvements in skills, they built what they referred to as 'CARTER BOATS' which is sharp at both ends. They used sails to travel around Malaita and to other Islands such as Gudalcanal and Isabel. Commercial boat building in the constituency started in the 1960s around the time when the Government established a boat building school in Auki.

Stories retold from myths said that the first person to introduce shell money to the Langalanga lagoon was a woman from [[Buin, Papua New Guinea|Buin]] in Bougainville. She was banish and floated in a coconut shell from Buin to Guadalcanal and finally to Malaita and landed at Tafilo a village at Lalana near Laulasi. Traditionally, there had been substantive trade between the Langalanga people and people from Buin in shell money until the emergence of the Bougainville crises. Most of the private ship owners from the constituency generated capital through shell money trade to build their ships. They took shell money to Buin and traded it for cash and used the cash to build wooden boats.<ref name=\"Economic\">{{cite web |url=https://www.academia.edu/1613811/_Making_Money_Objects_Productions_and_Performances_of_Shell_Money_Manufacture_in_Langalanga_Solomon_Islands  |title=\"Making Money\": Objects, Productions, and Performances of Shell Money Manufacture in Langalanga, Solomon Island|author=Pei-yi Guo|accessdate=22 March 2014 |publisher=The Frontiers of Southeast Asia and Pacific Studies |date=1 January 2006}}</ref>\n\nAs the production rate increased, shell resources were depleted, particularly in Langalanga lagoon.

Later, with improvements in skills, they built what they referred to as 'CARTER BOATS' which is sharp at both ends.

Stories retold from myths said that the first person to introduce shell money to the Langalanga lagoon was a woman from [[Buin, Papua New Guinea|Buin]] in Bougainville. She was banish and floated in a coconut shell from Buin to Guadalcanal and finally to Malaita and landed at Tafilo a village at Lalana near Laulasi. Traditionally, there had been substantive trade between the Langalanga people and people from Buin in shell money until the emergence of the Bougainville crises. Most of the private ship owners from the constituency generated capital through shell money trade to build their ships. They took shell money to Buin and traded it for cash and used the cash to build wooden boats.<ref name=\"Economic\">{{cite web |url=https://www.academia.edu/1613811/_Making_Money_Objects_Productions_and_Performances_of_Shell_Money_Manufacture_in_Langalanga_Solomon_Islands  |title=\"Making Money\": Objects, Productions, and Performances of Shell Money Manufacture in Langalanga, Solomon Island|author=Pei-yi Guo|accessdate=22 March 2014 |publisher=The Frontiers of Southeast Asia and Pacific Studies |date=1 January 2006}}</ref>\n\nAs the production rate increased, shell resources were depleted, particularly in Langalanga lagoon.

In this primer, ch\u1eef N\u00f4m is used to gloss the Chinese characters, for example, {{vi-nom|\ud845\uddf6}} is used to gloss {{vi-nom|\u5929}}.]]\nChinese characters were introduced to Vietnam after the [[Han dynasty]] conquered the country in 111 BC. Independence was achieved in 939, but [[Literary Chinese]] was adopted for official purposes in 1010.{{sfn|Hannas|1997|pp=78\u201379, 82}} For most of the period up to the early 20th century, formal writing was indistinguishable from contemporaneous classical Chinese works produced in China, Korea, and Japan.<ref name=\"Marr141\">{{harvnb|Marr|1984|p=141}}: \"Because the Chinese characters were pronounced according to Vietnamese preferences, and because certain stylistic modifications occurred over time, later scholars came to refer to a hybrid \"Sino-Vietnamese\" (Han-Viet) language. However, there would seem to be no more justification for this term than for a fifteenth-century \"Latin-English\" versus the Latin written contemporaneously in Rome.\"</ref>\n\nVietnamese scholars were thus intimately familiar with Chinese writing.  In order to record their native language, they applied the structural principles of Chinese characters to develop ''ch\u1eef N\u00f4m''.  The new script was mostly used to record folk songs and for other popular literature.{{sfn|Marr|1984|p=141}}  Vietnamese written in ''ch\u1eef N\u00f4m'' briefly replaced Chinese for official purposes under the [[H\u1ed3 dynasty]] (1400\u20131407) and under the [[T\u00e2y S\u01a1n]] (1778\u20131802), but in both cases this was swiftly reversed.{{sfn|DeFrancis|1977|pp=32, 38}}\n\n===Earliest evidence===\n\nThe use of Chinese characters to write the Vietnamese language can be traced to an inscription with the two characters \"{{vi-nom|[[:wikt:\u5e03|\u5e03]][[:wikt:\u84cb|\u84cb]]}}\", as part of the posthumous title of [[Ph\u00f9ng H\u01b0ng]], a national hero who succeeded in expelling the Chinese, albeit briefly in the late 8th century. These two characters literally mean \"cloth\" + \"cover\" in Chinese but when pronounced by the Vietnamese, the phonetic value is employed to represent ''vua c\u00e1i'' (\"great king\"), or archaic Vietnamese ''b\u1ed1 c\u00e1i'' (\"father and mother\", i.e. as respectable as one's parents). During the 10th century, the founder of the [[\u0110inh dynasty]] (968-979) named the country ''\u0110\u1ea1i C\u1ed3 Vi\u1ec7t ''({{vi-nom|[[:wikt:\u5927|\u5927]][[:wikt:\u77bf|\u77bf]][[:wikt:\u8d8a|\u8d8a]]}}).

Language reform movements in other Asian nations stimulated Vietnamese interest in the subject. Following the [[Russo-Japanese War]] of 1905, Japan was increasingly cited as a model for modernization. The Confucian education system was compared unfavorably to the Japanese system of public education. According to a polemic by writer [[Phan Ch\u00e2u Trinh]], \"so-called Confucian scholars\" lacked knowledge of the modern world, as well as real understanding of Han literature. Their degrees showed only that they had learned how to write characters, he claimed.<ref>Phan Ch\u00e2u Trinh, \"Monarchy and Democracy\", ''Phan Ch\u00e2u Trinh and His Political Writings'', SEAP Publications, 2009, {{ISBN|978-0-87727-749-1}}, p. 126.

For example, in n\u00f4m texts the [[Tr\u1ecbnh]] lords (1545\u20131787) are Ch\u00faa Tr\u1ecbnh (ch\u1eef N\u00f4m: {{vi-nom|\u4e3b\u912d}}) not as in Sino-Vietnamese Tr\u1ecbnh v\u01b0\u01a1ng (ch\u1eef H\u00e1n: {{vi-nom|\u912d\u738b}}). Here the character used (lord in Vietnamese, king in Chinese) is also different, but the difference in syntax is that in Vietnamese the noun \"lord\" precedes the name, whereas in Chinese \"king\" follows the name.\n\nA similar example, in Vietnamese [[Truy\u1ec7n Ki\u1ec1u]] ({{vi-nom|\u50b3\u7ff9}}, lit. \"Tale of Ki\u1ec1u\") the word \"tale\" precedes the name, but in Chinese syntax \"tale\" (''truy\u1ec7n'' {{vi-nom|[[:wikt:\u50b3|\u50b3]]}}) should follow the name Ki\u1ec1u. The n\u00f4m term \"ch\u1eef N\u00f4m\" itself is an example of this. In Vietnamese n\u00f4m syntax the noun \"script\" ({{vi-nom|[[wikt:\ud846\ude38|\ud846\ude38]]}}) precedes \"Southern\" ({{vi-nom|[[wikt:\u5583|\u5583]]}}), whereas in ch\u1eef H\u00e1n the order is reversed and a purely Chinese ch\u1eef H\u00e1n character used instead of the locally created Ch\u1eef (ch\u1eef H\u00e1n: {{vi-nom|\u5583\u5b57}}). Similarly with gods and heroes; the syntax of the popular name [[Th\u00e1nh Gi\u00f3ng]] ({{vi-nom|\u8056\u5bb9}}) differs from his ch\u1eef H\u00e1n name Ph\u00f9 \u0110\u1ed5ng Thi\u00ean V\u01b0\u01a1ng ({{vi-nom|\u6276\u8463\u5929\u738b}}); the n\u00f4m name [[M\u1eabu Tho\u1ea3i]] ({{vi-nom|\u6bcd\u6c34}}), has a Vietnamese syntax while her ch\u1eef H\u00e1n name Th\u1ee7y cung Th\u00e1nh M\u1eabu ({{vi-nom|\u6c34\u5bae\u8056\u6bcd}}) exhibits Chinese syntax. The official Chinese [[T\u00ean ch\u1eef]] and vernacular [[T\u00ean n\u00f4m]] for village names may also have different syntax as well as different characters.<ref>Xavier Guillaume La Terre du Dragon Tome 2 \u2013 Page 59 \"Elle comprenait en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral un village principal (Xa) et les hameaux environnants (L\u00e0ng).

Unlike Japanese kana or Korean Hangul/no process of character simplification that resulted in a basic set of phonemes or syllables. Some of the problem lay in the tonal and nonagglutinative nature of Vietnamese as contrasted with Japanese or Korean.11 More important, however, was the attitude of most Vietnamese literati, who continued to regard Chinese as the ultimate in civilized communication and thus considered nom a form of recreation.\"</ref>\n\n===Borrowed characters===\n{{see also|Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary|Sino-Vietnamese reading|Literary and colloquial readings of Chinese characters}}\nUnmodified Chinese characters were used in ch\u1eef N\u00f4m in three different ways.\n\nA large proportion of Vietnamese vocabulary had been borrowed from Chinese from the Tang period.\nSuch [[Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary]] could be written with the original Chinese character for each word, for example:{{sfn|Hannas|1997|pp=80\u201381}}\n* {{vi-nom|{{linktext|\u5f79}}}} ''d\u1ecbch'' (\"service\", \"corv\u00e9e\"), from Early [[Middle Chinese]] (EMC) /jwiajk/{{sfn|Pulleyblank|1991|p=371}}\n* {{vi-nom|{{linktext|\u672c}}}} ''b\u1ea3n'' (\"root\", \"foundation\"), from EMC /p\u0259n'/{{sfn|Pulleyblank|1991|p=32}}\n* {{vi-nom|{{linktext|\u982d}}}} ''\u0111\u1ea7u'' (\"head\"), from EMC /d\u0259w/{{sfn|Pulleyblank|1991|p=311}}\nTo represent a native Vietnamese word, one method was to use a Chinese character for a Chinese word with a similar meaning. For example, {{vi-nom|\u672c}} may also represent ''v\u1ed1n'' (\"capital, funds\"). When a character would have two readings, a diacritic may be added to the character to indicate the \"indigenous\" reading. Thus when {{vi-nom|\u672c}} is meant to be read as ''v\u1ed1n'', it is written as {{vi-nom|\u672c<sup>\u3191</sup>}},<ref>{{vi-nom|\u3191}} is a visual approximation. The ''c\u00e1''' and ''nh\u00e1y'' marks will be added to the [[Ideographic Symbols and Punctuation]] in Unicode 13.0.</ref> with a diacritic at the upper right corner. The two most common alternate reading diacritical marks are ''c\u00e1'' and ''nh\u00e1y'' (a variant form of {{vi-nom|\u4e2a}}).<ref>{{cite web|title=Proposal to Encode Two Vietnamese Alternate Reading Marks|first1=Lee|last1=Collins|author2=Ng\u00f4 Thanh Nh\u00e0n|date=6 November 2017|url=https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2017/17373r-viet-alt-reading-marks.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref> In this case, the word ''v\u1ed1n'' is actually an earlier Chinese loan that has become accepted as Vietnamese; William Hannas claims that all such readings are similar early loans.{{sfn|Hannas|1997|pp=80\u201381}}\n\nAlternatively, a native Vietnamese word could be written using a Chinese character for a Chinese word with a similar sound, regardless of the meaning of the Chinese word. For example, {{vi-nom|{{linktext|\u6c92}}}} (Early Middle Chinese /m\u0259t/{{sfn|Pulleyblank|1991|p=218}}) may represent the Vietnamese word ''m\u1ed9t'' (\"one\").{{sfn|Hannas|1997|p=80}}\n\nTo draw an analogy to the [[Japanese writing system]], the first two categories are similar to the ''[[on'yomi|on]]'' and [[kun'yomi|''kun'' reading]]s of Japanese [[Kanji#Readings|kanji]] respectively. The third is similar to ''[[ateji]]'', in which characters are used only for their sound value, or the [[Man'y\u014dgana]] script that became the origin of [[hiragana]] and [[katakana]].\n\n===Locally invented characters===\n[[File:Nom Character V04-5055.svg|thumb|right|upright|The Nom character for ''[[pho|ph\u1edf]]'' ({{linktext|\ud871\uddbe|}}), a popular soup made from rice noodles, was added to the Unicode 8.0 as part of CJK Unified Ideographs Extended-E (\ud871\uddbe, U+2C5BE).{{efn|The character is part of the proposed set for Extension E.

The V Source code is V04-5055.}} The radical {{vi-nom|{{linktext|\u7c73}}}} on the left suggests that the meaning of the character is linked to rice. The phonetic component {{vi-nom|{{linktext|\u9817}}}} on the right suggests that the pronunciation of the character is linked to that of \u9817 ''ph\u1edf'', and in this case the character's pronunciation and that of its phonetic component is the same.]]\nIn contrast to the few hundred Japanese [[kokuji]] and handful of Korean [[gukja]], which are mostly rarely used characters for indigenous natural phenomena, Vietnamese scribes created thousands of new characters, used throughout the language.{{sfn|Hannas|1997|p=79}}\n\nSimilar to the Chinese writing system, the most common kind of invented character in Nom is the phono-semantic compound, made by combining two characters or components, one suggesting the word's meaning and the other its approximate sound.

As a result, a Vietnamese word can be represented by variant N\u00f4m characters. For example, the very word ''ch\u1eef'' (\"character\", \"script\"), a Chinese loan word, can be written as either {{vi-nom|{{linktext|\u5b57}}}} (Chinese character), {{vi-nom|\ud846\udd82}} (invented character, \"compound-semantic\") or {{vi-nom|\ud846\ude38}} (invented character, \"semantic-phonetic\"). For another example, the word ''b\u00e9o'' (\"fat\", \"greasy\") can be written either as {{vi-nom|\u813f}} or {{vi-nom|[[File:Chu nom fat.svg|18px|\u2ff0\u6708\u5831]]}}. Both characters are invented characters with a semantic-phonetic structure, the difference being the phonetic indicator ({{vi-nom|{{linktext|\u8868}}}} vs. {{vi-nom|{{linktext|\u5831}}}}).\n\nFrom 2013, Han-Nom Revival Committee of Vietnam, an internet-based organization has started its standardization work for Ch\u1eef [[H\u00e1n N\u00f4m]].

These two characters literally mean \"cloth\" + \"cover\" in Chinese but when pronounced by the Vietnamese, the phonetic value is employed to represent ''vua c\u00e1i'' (\"great king\"), or archaic Vietnamese ''b\u1ed1 c\u00e1i'' (\"father and mother\", i.e. as respectable as one's parents). During the 10th century, the founder of the [[\u0110inh dynasty]] (968-979) named the country ''\u0110\u1ea1i C\u1ed3 Vi\u1ec7t ''({{vi-nom|[[:wikt:\u5927|\u5927]][[:wikt:\u77bf|\u77bf]][[:wikt:\u8d8a|\u8d8a]]}}).

This is a translation of a lecture Chau gave in Saigon in 1925. \"Even at this moment, the so-called \"Confucian scholars (i.e. those who have studied Chinese characters, and in particular, those who have passed the degrees of ''c\u1eed nh\u00e2n'' [bachelor] and ''ti\u1ebfn s\u0129'' [doctorate]) do not know anything, I am sure, of Confucianism. Yet every time they open their mouths they use Confucianism to attack modern civilization \u2013 a civilization they do not comprehend even a tiny bit.\"</ref>\n\nThe popularity of Hanoi's short-lived [[Tonkin Free School]] suggested that broad reform was possible. In 1910, the colonial school system adopted a \"Franco-Vietnamese curriculum\", which emphasized French and alphabetic Vietnamese.

For example, in n\u00f4m texts the [[Tr\u1ecbnh]] lords (1545\u20131787) are Ch\u00faa Tr\u1ecbnh (ch\u1eef N\u00f4m: {{vi-nom|\u4e3b\u912d}}) not as in Sino-Vietnamese Tr\u1ecbnh v\u01b0\u01a1ng (ch\u1eef H\u00e1n: {{vi-nom|\u912d\u738b}}). Here the character used (lord in Vietnamese, king in Chinese) is also different, but the difference in syntax is that in Vietnamese the noun \"lord\" precedes the name, whereas in Chinese \"king\" follows the name.\n\nA similar example, in Vietnamese [[Truy\u1ec7n Ki\u1ec1u]] ({{vi-nom|\u50b3\u7ff9}}, lit. \"Tale of Ki\u1ec1u\") the word \"tale\" precedes the name, but in Chinese syntax \"tale\" (''truy\u1ec7n'' {{vi-nom|[[:wikt:\u50b3|\u50b3]]}}) should follow the name Ki\u1ec1u. The n\u00f4m term \"ch\u1eef N\u00f4m\" itself is an example of this. In Vietnamese n\u00f4m syntax the noun \"script\" ({{vi-nom|[[wikt:\ud846\ude38|\ud846\ude38]]}}) precedes \"Southern\" ({{vi-nom|[[wikt:\u5583|\u5583]]}}), whereas in ch\u1eef H\u00e1n the order is reversed and a purely Chinese ch\u1eef H\u00e1n character used instead of the locally created Ch\u1eef (ch\u1eef H\u00e1n: {{vi-nom|\u5583\u5b57}}). Similarly with gods and heroes; the syntax of the popular name [[Th\u00e1nh Gi\u00f3ng]] ({{vi-nom|\u8056\u5bb9}}) differs from his ch\u1eef H\u00e1n name Ph\u00f9 \u0110\u1ed5ng Thi\u00ean V\u01b0\u01a1ng ({{vi-nom|\u6276\u8463\u5929\u738b}}); the n\u00f4m name [[M\u1eabu Tho\u1ea3i]] ({{vi-nom|\u6bcd\u6c34}}), has a Vietnamese syntax while her ch\u1eef H\u00e1n name Th\u1ee7y cung Th\u00e1nh M\u1eabu ({{vi-nom|\u6c34\u5bae\u8056\u6bcd}}) exhibits Chinese syntax. The official Chinese [[T\u00ean ch\u1eef]] and vernacular [[T\u00ean n\u00f4m]] for village names may also have different syntax as well as different characters.<ref>Xavier Guillaume La Terre du Dragon Tome 2 \u2013 Page 59 \"Elle comprenait en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral un village principal (Xa) et les hameaux environnants (L\u00e0ng).

Unlike Japanese kana or Korean Hangul/no process of character simplification that resulted in a basic set of phonemes or syllables. Some of the problem lay in the tonal and nonagglutinative nature of Vietnamese as contrasted with Japanese or Korean.11 More important, however, was the attitude of most Vietnamese literati, who continued to regard Chinese as the ultimate in civilized communication and thus considered nom a form of recreation.\"</ref>\n\n===Borrowed characters===\n{{see also|Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary|Sino-Vietnamese reading|Literary and colloquial readings of Chinese characters}}\nUnmodified Chinese characters were used in ch\u1eef N\u00f4m in three different ways.\n\nA large proportion of Vietnamese vocabulary had been borrowed from Chinese from the Tang period.\nSuch [[Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary]] could be written with the original Chinese character for each word, for example:{{sfn|Hannas|1997|pp=80\u201381}}\n* {{vi-nom|{{linktext|\u5f79}}}} ''d\u1ecbch'' (\"service\", \"corv\u00e9e\"), from Early [[Middle Chinese]] (EMC) /jwiajk/{{sfn|Pulleyblank|1991|p=371}}\n* {{vi-nom|{{linktext|\u672c}}}} ''b\u1ea3n'' (\"root\", \"foundation\"), from EMC /p\u0259n'/{{sfn|Pulleyblank|1991|p=32}}\n* {{vi-nom|{{linktext|\u982d}}}} ''\u0111\u1ea7u'' (\"head\"), from EMC /d\u0259w/{{sfn|Pulleyblank|1991|p=311}}\nTo represent a native Vietnamese word, one method was to use a Chinese character for a Chinese word with a similar meaning. For example, {{vi-nom|\u672c}} may also represent ''v\u1ed1n'' (\"capital, funds\"). When a character would have two readings, a diacritic may be added to the character to indicate the \"indigenous\" reading. Thus when {{vi-nom|\u672c}} is meant to be read as ''v\u1ed1n'', it is written as {{vi-nom|\u672c<sup>\u3191</sup>}},<ref>{{vi-nom|\u3191}} is a visual approximation. The ''c\u00e1''' and ''nh\u00e1y'' marks will be added to the [[Ideographic Symbols and Punctuation]] in Unicode 13.0.</ref> with a diacritic at the upper right corner. The two most common alternate reading diacritical marks are ''c\u00e1'' and ''nh\u00e1y'' (a variant form of {{vi-nom|\u4e2a}}).<ref>{{cite web|title=Proposal to Encode Two Vietnamese Alternate Reading Marks|first1=Lee|last1=Collins|author2=Ng\u00f4 Thanh Nh\u00e0n|date=6 November 2017|url=https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2017/17373r-viet-alt-reading-marks.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref> In this case, the word ''v\u1ed1n'' is actually an earlier Chinese loan that has become accepted as Vietnamese; William Hannas claims that all such readings are similar early loans.{{sfn|Hannas|1997|pp=80\u201381}}\n\nAlternatively, a native Vietnamese word could be written using a Chinese character for a Chinese word with a similar sound, regardless of the meaning of the Chinese word. For example, {{vi-nom|{{linktext|\u6c92}}}} (Early Middle Chinese /m\u0259t/{{sfn|Pulleyblank|1991|p=218}}) may represent the Vietnamese word ''m\u1ed9t'' (\"one\").{{sfn|Hannas|1997|p=80}}\n\nTo draw an analogy to the [[Japanese writing system]], the first two categories are similar to the ''[[on'yomi|on]]'' and [[kun'yomi|''kun'' reading]]s of Japanese [[Kanji#Readings|kanji]] respectively. The third is similar to ''[[ateji]]'', in which characters are used only for their sound value, or the [[Man'y\u014dgana]] script that became the origin of [[hiragana]] and [[katakana]].\n\n===Locally invented characters===\n[[File:Nom Character V04-5055.svg|thumb|right|upright|The Nom character for ''[[pho|ph\u1edf]]'' ({{linktext|\ud871\uddbe|}}), a popular soup made from rice noodles, was added to the Unicode 8.0 as part of CJK Unified Ideographs Extended-E (\ud871\uddbe, U+2C5BE).{{efn|The character is part of the proposed set for Extension E.

The V Source code is V04-5055.}} The radical {{vi-nom|{{linktext|\u7c73}}}} on the left suggests that the meaning of the character is linked to rice. The phonetic component {{vi-nom|{{linktext|\u9817}}}} on the right suggests that the pronunciation of the character is linked to that of \u9817 ''ph\u1edf'', and in this case the character's pronunciation and that of its phonetic component is the same.]]\nIn contrast to the few hundred Japanese [[kokuji]] and handful of Korean [[gukja]], which are mostly rarely used characters for indigenous natural phenomena, Vietnamese scribes created thousands of new characters, used throughout the language.{{sfn|Hannas|1997|p=79}}\n\nSimilar to the Chinese writing system, the most common kind of invented character in Nom is the phono-semantic compound, made by combining two characters or components, one suggesting the word's meaning and the other its approximate sound. For example,{{sfn|Hannas|1997|p=81}}\n* {{vi-nom|{{linktext|\ud840\udc27}}}} (''ba'' \"three\") is composed of the phonetic part {{vi-nom|{{linktext|\u5df4}}}} (Sino-Vietnamese reading: ''ba'') and the semantic part {{vi-nom|{{linktext|\u4e09}}}} \"three\". \"Father\" is also ''ba'', but written as {{vi-nom|{{linktext|\u7238}} (\u2ff1{{linktext|\u7236|\u5df4}}}}), while \"turtle\" is ''con ba ba'' {{vi-nom|{{linktext|\u6606|\u8686|\u8686}}}}.\n* {{vi-nom|{{linktext|\u5a84}}}} (''m\u1eb9'' \"mother\") has {{vi-nom|{{linktext|\u5973}}}} \"woman\" as semantic component and {{vi-nom|{{linktext|\u7f8e}}}} (Sino-Vietnamese reading: ''m\u1ef9'') as phonetic component.{{efn|The character \u5a84 is also used in Chinese as an alternate form of \u7f8e \"beautiful\".}}\n\nA smaller group consists of semantic compound characters, which are composed of two Chinese characters representing words of similar meaning. For example, {{vi-nom|{{linktext|\ud845\uddf6}}}} (''gi\u1eddi'' or ''tr\u1eddi'' \"sky\", \"heaven\") is composed of {{vi-nom|{{linktext|\u5929}}}} (\"sky\") and {{vi-nom|{{linktext|\u4e0a}}}} (\"upper\").{{sfn|Hannas|1997|p=81}}\n\nA few characters were obtained by modifying Chinese characters related either semantically or phonetically to the word to be represented.

As a result, a Vietnamese word can be represented by variant N\u00f4m characters. For example, the very word ''ch\u1eef'' (\"character\", \"script\"), a Chinese loan word, can be written as either {{vi-nom|{{linktext|\u5b57}}}} (Chinese character), {{vi-nom|\ud846\udd82}} (invented character, \"compound-semantic\") or {{vi-nom|\ud846\ude38}} (invented character, \"semantic-phonetic\"). For another example, the word ''b\u00e9o'' (\"fat\", \"greasy\") can be written either as {{vi-nom|\u813f}} or {{vi-nom|[[File:Chu nom fat.svg|18px|\u2ff0\u6708\u5831]]}}. Both characters are invented characters with a semantic-phonetic structure, the difference being the phonetic indicator ({{vi-nom|{{linktext|\u8868}}}} vs. {{vi-nom|{{linktext|\u5831}}}}).\n\nFrom 2013, Han-Nom Revival Committee of Vietnam, an internet-based organization has started its standardization work for Ch\u1eef [[H\u00e1n N\u00f4m]].

They are also used to write [[Inuktitut]] in the eastern Canadian Arctic; there they are co-official with the [[Latin script]] in the territory of [[Nunavut]]. They are used regionally for the other large Canadian Algonquian language, [[Ojibwe language|Ojibwe]], as well as for [[Blackfoot language|Blackfoot]], where they are obsolete.{{clarify|reason=Are they used or obsolete?|date=June 2019}} Among the [[Athabaskan languages]] further to the west, syllabics have been used at one point or another to write [[Carrier language|Dakelh]] (Carrier), [[Chipewyan language|Chipewyan]], [[Slavey language|Slavey]], [[T\u0142\u0131\u0328ch\u01eb]] (Dogrib) and [[Dane-zaa]] (Beaver). Syllabics have occasionally been used in the [[United States]] by communities that straddle the border, but are principally a [[Canadians|Canadian]] phenomenon.\n\n==Basic principles==\nCanadian \"syllabic\" scripts are not [[syllabary|syllabaries]], in which every consonant\u2013vowel sequence has a separate glyph,<ref>For example, in a true syllabary ''pi'' would have no graphic connection to ''pa.''</ref> but [[abugida]]s,<ref>Bernard Comrie, 2005, \"Writing Systems\", in Haspelmath et al. eds, ''The World Atlas of Language Structures'' (p 568 ''ff).'' Also Robert Bringhurst, 2004, ''The solid form of language: an essay on writing and meaning''. Comrie and Bringhurst use the term ''alphasyllabic,'' but the terms are essentially synonymous.</ref> in which consonants are modified in order to indicate an associated vowel&mdash;in this case through a change in orientation, which is unique to Canadian syllabics. In Cree, for example, the consonant ''p'' has the shape of a chevron. In an upward orientation, \u1431, it transcribes the syllable ''pi''. Inverted, so that it points downwards, \u142f, it transcribes ''pe''. Pointing to the left, \u1438, it is ''pa,'' and to the right, \u1433, ''po''. The consonant forms and the vowels so represented vary from language to language, but generally approximate their Cree origins.<ref name=nichols/>\n\n[[File:Evans 1841 Cree script.jpg|325px|thumb|Evans' script, as published in 1841.

Indeed, computer fonts have separate coding points for each syllable (each orientation of each consonant), and the [[Unicode Consortium]] considers syllabics to be a \"featural syllabary\" along with such scripts as [[hangul]], where each block represents a syllable, but consonants and vowels are indicated independently (in Cree syllabics, the consonant by the shape of a glyph, and the vowel by its orientation). This is unlike a true syllabary, where each combination of consonant and vowel has an independent form that is unrelated to other syllables with the same consonant or vowel.<ref>[http://www.cesarkallas.net/arquivos/livros/informatica/unicode/ch06.pdf The Unicode Standard, Version 4.0], 2003:149</ref>\n\n===Syllabic and final consonant forms===\nThe original script, which was designed for Western Swampy Cree, had ten such letter-forms: Eight for syllables based on the consonants ''p-, t-, c-, k-, m-, n-, s-, y-'' (pronounced /p, t, ts, k, m, n, s, j/), another for [[zero consonant|vowel-initial syllables]], and finally a blended form, now obsolete, for the consonant cluster ''sp-''. In the 1840 version, all were written with a light line to show the vowel was short and a heavier line to show the vowel was long: \u1472 ''ka'', '''\u1472''' ''k\u00e2''; however, in the 1841 version, a light line indicated minuscules (\"[[Type case|lowercase]]\") and a heavier line indicated majuscules ([[Type case|\"uppercase\"]]): \u1472 ''ka'', '''\u1472''' ''KA'' or ''Ka''; additionally in the 1841 version, complete letter-form indicated a short vowel, but for a long vowel Evans had notched the [[Sort (typesetting)|sort face]] such that in print the letter-form was broken\u2014a hand-written variant, an [[overdot]] for vowel length, is now used in printing as well: \u1455 ''ta'', \u1456 ''t\u00e2''. One consonant, ''w,'' had no letter form of its own but was indicated by a diacritic on another syllable; this is because it could combine with any of the consonants, as in \u147f ''kwa,'' as well as existing on its own, as in \u1418 ''wa''.<ref name=nichols/>\n\nThere were distinct letters for the nine consonants ''-p, -t, -c, -k, -m, -n, -s, -y,'' and ''w,'' when they occurred at the end of a syllable.In addition, four \"final\" consonants had no syllabic forms: ''-h, -l, -r,'' and the sequence ''-hk.'' These were originally written midline, but are now superscripted. (The glyph for ''-hk'' represents the most common final sequence of the language, being a common grammatical ending in Cree, and was used for common ''-nk'' in Ojibwe.) The consonants ''-l'' and ''-r'' were marginal, only found in borrowings, baby talk, and the like. These, and ''-h'', could occur before vowels, but were written with the final shape regardless. (''-l'' and ''-r'' are now written the size of full letters when they occur before vowels, as the finals were originally, or in some syllabics scripts have been replaced with full rotating syllabic forms; ''-h'' only occurs before a vowel in joined morphemes, in couple grammatical words, or in pedagogical materials to indicate the consonant value following it is a [[Fortis (linguistics)|fortis]].)<ref name=nichols/>\n\n===Vowel transformations===\n[[File:Ojibwe-Syllabics-Centennial-park.JPG|thumb|The orientation of a perfectly symmetrical vowel triangle may be difficult to discern. In the type of this Ojibwe sign, left-pointing ''a'' is an [[isosceles]] right-angled triangle, but upright ''i'' is acute-angled and [[isosceles]].]]\nThe vowels fall into two sets, the [[back vowel]]s ''-a'' and ''-u,'' and the [[front vowel]]s ''-e'' and ''-i.'' Each set consists of a [[vowel height|lower vowel]], ''-a'' or ''-e,'' and a higher vowel, ''-u'' or ''-i.'' In all cases, back-vowel syllables are related through left-right reflection: that is, they are mirror images of each other. How they relate to front-vowel syllables depends on the graphic form of the consonants. These follow two patterns.

That appears to be how Evans designed the script, but this algorithm does not work for consonants added later on when syllabics was adapted for other Cree dialects or for other languages such as Inuktitut.</ref>\n\nThe symmetrical letter forms can be illustrated by arranging them into a diamond:\n\n::{|\n| || \u1403 || || &emsp; || || i || || &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\n| || \u1431 || || &emsp; || || bi/pi ||  || &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\n| || \u144e || || || || ti/di ||\n|-\n| \u140a || || \u1405 || || a || || o ||&nbsp;\n| \u1438 || || \u1433 || || ba/pa ||  || bo/po ||&nbsp;\n| \u1455 || || \u1450 || || ta/da ||  || to/do\n|-\n| || \u1401 || || || || e || || &nbsp;\n| || \u142f || || || || be/pe ||  || &nbsp;\n| || \u144c || || || || te/de ||\n|}\n\nAnd the asymmetrical letter forms can be illustrated by arranging them into a square:\n\n::{|\n| \u146d || \u146b || &emsp; || gi/ki || ge/ke ||&nbsp;\n| \u148b || \u1489 || &emsp; || ji/ci || je/ce ||\n| \u14a5 || \u14a3 || &emsp; || mi || me ||\n| \u14c2 || \u14c0 || &emsp; || ni || ne ||\n| \u14ef || \u14ed || &emsp; || si || se ||\n| \u1528 || \u1526 || &emsp; || yi || ye ||\n|-\n| \u1472 || \u146f || &emsp; || ga/ka || go/ko ||&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\n| \u1490 || \u148d || &emsp; || ja/ca || jo/co ||&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\n| \u14aa || \u14a7 || &emsp; || ma || mo ||&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\n| \u14c7 || \u14c4 || &emsp; || na || no ||&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\n| \u14f4 || \u14f1 || &emsp; || sa || so ||&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\n| \u152d || \u152a || &emsp; || ya || yo ||&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\n|}\n\nThese forms are present in most syllabics scripts with sounds values that approach their Swampy Cree origins. For example, all scripts except the one for Blackfoot use the triangle for vowel-initial syllables.\n\nBy 1841, when Evans cast the first movable type for syllabics, he found that he could not satisfactorily maintain the distinction between light and heavy typeface for short and long vowels. He instead filed across the raised lines of the type, leaving gaps in the printed letter for long vowels. This can be seen in early printings. Later still a dot diacritic, originally used for vowel length only in handwriting, was extended to print: Thus today \u140a ''a'' contrasts with \u140b ''\u00e2,'' and \u14a5 ''mi'' contrasts with \u14a6 ''m\u00ee''. Although Cree ''\u00ea'' only occurs long, the script made length distinctions for all four vowels. Not all writers then or now indicate length, or do not do so consistently; since there is no contrast, no one today writes ''\u00ea'' as a long vowel.<ref name=nichols/>\n\n===Pointing===\nReflecting the shorthand principles on which it was based, syllabics may be written ''plain'', indicating only the basic consonant\u2013vowel outline of speech, or ''pointed'', with diacritics for vowel length and the consonants {{IPA|/w/}} and {{IPA|/h/}}. Full phonemic pointing is rare. Syllabics may also be written without [[word divider|word division]], as Devanagari once was, or with spaces or dots between words or prefixes.<ref name=nichols/>\n\n===Punctuation===\nThe only punctuation found in many texts is spacing between words and \u166e for a full stop. Punctuation from the Latin script, including the period (.), may also be used.<ref name=nichols/> Due to the final ''c'' resembling a hyphen, a [[double hyphen]] {{angle bracket|\u1400}}<!-- U+1400 --> is used as the Canadian Aboriginal syllabics hyphen.\n\n==Glossary==\nSome common terms as used in the context of syllabics\n\n===\"Syllables\", or full-size letters===\n\nThe full-sized characters, whether standing for consonant-vowel combinations or vowels alone, are usually called \"syllables\". They may be [[phoneme|phonemic]] rather than [[morphophonemic]] syllables. That is, when one [[morpheme]] (word element) ends in a consonant and the next begins with a vowel, the intermediate consonant is written as a syllable with the following vowel.  For example, the Plains Cree word ''p\u012bhc-\u0101yi-hk'' \"indoors\" has ''p\u012bhc'' as its first morpheme, and ''\u0101yi'' as its second, but is written \u1432\u1426\u1491\u1528\u157d ''p\u012bh-c\u0101-yihk.''\n\nIn other cases, a \"syllable\" may in fact represent only a consonant, again due to the underlying structure of the language. In Plains Cree, \u1456\u14c2\u14ef ''t\u0101nisi'' \"hello\" or \"how are you?\" is written as if it had three syllables.  Because the first syllable has the stress and the syllable that follows has a short {{IPA|/i/}}, the vowel is dropped.  As a result, the word is pronounced \"t\u0101nsi\" with only two syllables.\n\nSyllabication is important to determining stress in Algonquian languages, and vice versa, so this ambiguity in syllabics is relatively important in Algonquian languages.\n\n====Series====\n[[File:Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics\u2014SH-series variations.png|thumb|Presentations style variations of the Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics SH-series in commonly available typefaces.]]\nThe word \"series\" is used for either a set of syllables with the same vowel, or a set with the same initial consonant.  Thus the n-series is the set of syllables that begin with ''n,'' and the o-series is the set of syllables that have ''o'' as their vowel regardless of their initial consonant.\n\n===\"Finals\", or reduced letters===\n\nA series of small raised letters are called \"finals\". They are usually placed after a syllable to indicate a final consonant, as the \u157d ''-hk'' in \u1528\u157d ''yihk'' above. However, the Cree consonant ''h,'' which only has a final form, begins a small number of function words such as \u1426\u140b\u1424  ''h\u0101w.''  In such cases the \"final\" \u1426 represents an ''initial'' consonant and therefore precedes the syllable.\n\nThe use of diacritics to write consonants is unusual in abugidas. However, it also occurs (independently) in the [[Lepcha script]].\n\nFinals are commonly employed in the extension of syllabics to languages it was not initially designed for. In some of the Athabaskan alphabets, finals have been extended to appear at mid height after a syllable, lowered after a syllable, and at mid height before a syllable.  For example, Chipewyan and Slavey use the final \u141f in the latter position to indicate the initial consonant ''dl'' ({{IPA|/\u026e/}}).\n\nIn Naskapi, a small raised letter based on ''sa'' is used for [[consonant cluster]]s that begin with /s/: \u150c ''spwa,'' \u150d ''stwa,'' \u150e ''skwa,'' and \u150f ''scwa.'' The Cree languages the script was initially designed for had no such clusters.\n\nIn Inuktitut, something similar is used not to indicate sequences, but to represent additional consonants, rather as the [[Digraph (orthography)|digraphs]] ''ch, sh, th'' were used to extend the Latin letters ''c, s, t'' to represent additional consonants in English. In Inuktitut, a raised ''na-ga'' is placed before the ''g-'' series, \u158f \u1591 \u1593, to form an ''ng-'' ({{IPA|/\u014b/}}) series, and a raised ''ra'' (uvular {{IPA|/\u0281/}}) is placed before syllables of the ''k-'' series, \u157f \u1581 \u1583, to form a uvular ''q-'' series.\n\nAlthough the forms of these series have two parts, each is encoded into the Unicode standard as a single character.\n\n===Diacritics===\n\nOther marks placed above or beside the syllable are called \"diacritics\".  These include the dot placed above a syllable to mark a long vowel, as in \u14a6 ''m\u00ee,'' and the dot placed at mid height after the syllable (in western Cree dialects) or before the syllable (in eastern Cree dialects) to indicate a medial ''w,'' as in \u147f ''kwa.'' These are all encoded as single characters in Unicode.\n\nDiacritics used by other languages include a ring above on Moose Cree \u146c ''kay'' (encoded as \"kaai\"), head ring on Ojibwe \u1553 ''fe'', head barb on Inuktitut \u15a4 ''lha'', tail barb on West Cree \u158c ''ro'', centred stroke (a small vertical bar) in Carrier \u15c7 ''ghee'', centred dot in Carrier \u15c8 ''ghi'', centred bar (a bar perpendicular to the body) in Cree \u15a8 ''thi'', and a variety of other marks.  Such diacritics may or may not be separately encoded into Unicode.  There is no systematic way to distinguish elements that are parts of syllables from diacritics, or diacritics from finals, and academic discussions of syllabics are often inconsistent in their terminology.\n\n====Points and pointing====\n\nThe diacritic mark used to indicate vowel length is often referred to as a \"point\".  Syllabics users do not always consistently mark vowel length, ''w,'' or ''h.''  A text with these marked is called a\n\"pointed\" text; one without such marks is said to be \"unpointed\".\n\n===Syllabaries and syllabics===\nThe word ''syllabary'' has two meanings: a writing system with a separate character for each syllable, but also a table of syllables, including any script arranged in a syllabic chart. Evans' Latin Ojibwe alphabet, for example, was presented as a syllabary. Canadian Aboriginal ''syllabics'', the script itself, is thus distinct from a syllabary (syllabic chart) that displays them.\n\n===Round and Square===\n[[File:Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics\u2014Round-form and Square-form.jpg|thumb|Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics\u2014Round form and Square form comparison]]\n\nWhile Greek, Latin, and Cyrillic have [[Serif]] and [[Sans-Serif]] forms, Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics generally do not. Instead, like the [[Proportional font|Proportional]] and [[Monospace font]]s, Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics have a Round form and a Square form.  Round form, known in Cree as ''K\u00e2-w\u00e2wiy\u00eayaki'', is akin to a Proportional font, characterised their smooth bowls, differing letter heights, and occupying a rectangular space.  Round form syllabics are more commonly found east of [[Lake Winnipeg]].  Square form, known in Cree as ''K\u00e2-ayisaw\u00eayaki'', is akin to a Monospace font, characterised by their cornered bowls, same letter heights, and occupying a square space.  Square form syllabics are more commonly found west of Lake Winnipeg.\n\n==History==\n{{Alphabet}}\nCree syllabics were created in a process that culminated in 1840 by [[James Evans (linguist)|James Evans]], a missionary, and mistan\u00e2skow\u00eaw, a Cree (Badger Calling, - from mistanask \u14a5\u1422\u1455\u14c7\u1422\u1420 'badger' and -w\u00eaw \u1401\u1427\u1424 'voice/call').<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Stevenson|first1=Winona|title=Calling Badger and the Symbols of the Spirit Language: The Cree Origins of the Syllabic System|journal=Oral History Forum|date=1999\u20132000|volume=19-20|pages=19\u201324}}</ref> Evans formalized them for [[Swampy Cree]] and [[Ojibwe language|Ojibwe]]. Evans had been inspired by the success of [[Sequoyah|Sequoyah's]] [[Cherokee syllabary]] after encountering problems with Latin-based alphabets, and drew on his knowledge of [[Devanagari]] and shorthand. Canadian syllabics would in turn influence the [[Pollard script]] in China.<ref name=nichols>John Nichols, 1996. \"The Cree Syllabary\". In Daniels & Bright, ''The World's Writing Systems'', p 599''ff''</ref> Other missionaries were reluctant to use it, but it was rapidly indigenized and spread to new communities before missionaries arrived. Some scholars assert that the Cree created a legend after 1840 that Canadian syllabics originated from Cree culture.<ref>Verne Dusenberry, 1962. ''The Montana Cree: A Study in Religious Persistence'' (Acta Universitatis Stockholmiensis 3). p 267\u2013269</ref> Cree scholar Winona Stevenson explores the possibility that the inspiration for Cree syllabics may have originated from a near-death experience of \u14a5\u1422\u1455\u14c7\u1422\u1420\u1401\u1427\u1424 mistan\u00e2skow\u00eaw. Stevenson references Fine Day cited in Mandelbaum's ''The Plains Cree'' who states that he learned the syllabary from Strikes-him-on-the-back who learned it directly from \u14a5\u1422\u1455\u14c7\u1422\u1420\u1401\u1427\u1424 mistan\u00e2skow\u00eaw <ref>{{cite journal|last1=Stevenson|first1=Winona|title=Calling Badger and the Symbols of the Spirit Language: The Cree Origins of the Syllabic System|journal=Oral History Forum|date=1999\u20132000|volume=19-20|pages=19\u201324}}</ref>\n\n===James Evans===\nIn 1827, Evans, a missionary from [[Kingston upon Hull|Kingston upon Hull, England]], was placed in charge of the [[Wesleyan]] mission at [[Rice Lake (Ontario)|Rice Lake, Ontario]].  Here, he began to learn the eastern [[Ojibwe language]] spoken in the area and was part of a committee to devise a [[Latin script|Latin alphabet]] for it. By 1837 he had prepared the ''Speller and Interpreter in English and Indian,'' but was unable to get its printing sanctioned by the [[British and Foreign Bible Society]]. At the time, many missionary societies were opposed to the development of native literacy in their own languages, believing that their situation would be bettered by linguistic assimilation into colonial society.\n\nEvans continued to use his [[Ojibwe writing systems#Evans system|Ojibwe orthography]] in his work in Ontario. As was common at the time, the [[orthography]] called for hyphens between the syllables of words, giving written Ojibwe a partially syllabic structure. However, his students appear to have had conceptual difficulties using the same alphabet for two different languages with very different sounds, and Evans himself found this approach awkward. Furthermore, the Ojibwe language was [[polysynthesis|polysynthetic]] but had few distinct syllables, meaning that most words had a large number of syllables; this made them quite long when written with the Latin script. He began to experiment with creating a more syllabic script that he thought might be less awkward for his students to use.\n\nIn 1840, Evans was relocated to [[Norway House, Manitoba|Norway House]] in northern [[Manitoba]].  Here he began learning the local [[Swampy Cree language|Swampy Cree]] dialect. Like [[Ojibwe language|Ojibwe]], to which it was quite closely related, it was full of long polysyllabic words.\n\nAs an amateur linguist, Evans was acquainted with the [[Devanagari]] script used in [[British India]]; in Devanagari, each letter stands for a syllable, and is modified to represent the vowel of that syllable. Such a system, now called an [[abugida]], readily lent itself to writing a language such as Swampy Cree, which had a simple syllable structure of only eight consonants and four long or short vowels. Evans was also familiar with British shorthand, presumably Samuel Taylor's ''[[Taylor shorthand|Universal Stenography]],'' from his days as a merchant in England; and now he acquired familiarity with the newly published [[Pitman shorthand]] of 1837.\n\n===Origins===\nBoth Devanagari and Pitman played a role in the development of Cree syllabics.<ref>Andrew Dalby (2004:139) ''Dictionary of Languages''</ref> Devanagari provided the glyphs for the syllables, whereas Pitman provided the glyphs for the final consonants, as well as the idea of rotation and line weight to modify the syllables.\n\nIn the original Evans script, there were ten syllabic forms: eight for the consonants ''p'', ''t'', ''c'', ''k'', ''m'', ''n'', ''s'', ''y''; a ninth for vowel-initial syllables or vowels following one of the incidental consonants; and a tenth, which is no longer in use, for the consonant cluster ''sp''. There were four incidental consonants, ''r'', ''l'', ''w'', ''h'', which did not have syllabic forms. Except for ''sp'', these can all be traced to the cursive combining forms of the corresponding Devanagari ''akshara;'' the Devanagari combining form is somewhat abbreviated (the right-side stroke is dropped), and in handwriting the running horizontal line may be left off as well, as has been standardized in [[Gujar\u0101ti script|Gujarati]]. (The sequence ''sp'' appears to be a conflation of the shape of ''s'' with the angularity of ''p'', along the conceptual lines of the more contracted [[Typographic ligature|ligature]]s of Devanagari such as {{lang|und-Deva|\u0915\u094d\u0937}}.)\n\nThe likeness is stronger if one allows the symbols to rotate to give a similar direction of writing for each vowel; for example, Devanagari ''n'' has the orientation of ''ne'' rather than of ''na''.\nThe motivation for the change of orientation appears to have been to allow the pen to trace the same direction when writing syllables with the same vowels: The reflection class ''ka'', ''ca'', ''ma'', ''sa'', ''ya'' (that is, the consonants that are flipped to distinguish the front ''i'', ''e'' vowels) all follow an L-like path, whereas the rotation class ''a'', ''pa'', ''ta'', ''na'' (those rotated for the front vowels) all follow a C-like path. The orientation of Devanagari ''g-'' (for ''k-''), ''n-'', ''y-'', and possibly ''s-'' had to be flipped for this to happen. (''Sp-'' does not follow this generalization, reflecting its hybrid origin.)\n\nBecause Cree consonants can be either [[voiced consonant|voiced]] or voiceless, depending on their environment, each corresponds to two Devanagari letters, and Cree ''ka''/''ga'', for example, resembles Devanagari ''g'' rather than ''k''. The consonant ''h'', which only occurs as a final in syllabics, appears to derive from the Devanagari [[visarga]], {{lang|und-Deva|\u25cc\u0903}} ''\u1e25'', which also occurs only as a final, rather than from syllabic {{lang|und-Deva|\u0939}} ''ha''.\n[[File:Nagari-syllabics.png|thumb|upright|right|Devanagari combining forms compared to syllabics]]\n:{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ {{nowrap|Devanagari source of initial and}} independent Cree consonants\n!colspan=3|Devanagari full<br />and [[Devanagari#Conjuncts|half form]]s!!colspan=2|Cree\n|-\n|colspan=5|''Syllables''\n|-\n| style=\"width:4em;\" | {{lang|und-Deva|\u090f}} || style=\"width:4em;\" | ''e''|| style=\"width:4em;\" | {{lang|und-Deva|\u090f}} || style=\"width:4em;\" | \u1401 || style=\"width:4em;\" | ''e''\n|-\n|{{lang|und-Deva|\u092a}} ||''pa''||{{lang|und-Deva|\u092a\u094d\u200d&#8205;}}||\u1438||''pa/ba''\n|-\n|{{lang|und-Deva|\u091f}} ||''\u1e6da''||{{lang|und-Deva|\u091f\u200d&#8205;}}||\u1455||''ta/da''\n|-\n|{{lang|und-Deva|\u091c}} ||''ja''||{{lang|und-Deva|\u091c\u094d\u200d&#8205;}}||\u1490||''cha/ja''\n|-\n|{{lang|und-Deva|\u0917}} ||''ga''||{{lang|und-Deva|\u0917\u094d\u200d&#8205;}}||\u146f||''ko/go''\n|-\n|{{lang|und-Deva|\u092e}} ||''ma''||{{lang|und-Deva|\u092e\u094d\u200d&#8205;}}||\u14aa||''ma''\n|-\n|{{lang|und-Deva|\u0928}} ||''na''||{{lang|und-Deva|\u0928\u094d\u200d&#8205;}}||\u14c2||''ne''\n|-\n|{{lang|und-Deva|\u0938}} ||''sa''||{{lang|und-Deva|\u0938\u094d\u200d&#8205;}}||\u14f4||''sa''*\n|-\n|{{lang|und-Deva|\u092f}} ||''ya''||{{lang|und-Deva|\u092f\u094d\u200d&#8205;}}||\u152a||''yo''\n|-\n|colspan=5|''Incidental consonants''\n|-\n|{{lang|und-Deva|\u0932}} ||''la''||{{lang|und-Deva|\u0932\u094d\u200d&#8205;}}||\u14eb||''-l''\n|-\n|{{lang|und-Deva|\u0930}} ||''ra''|| {{lang|und-Deva|\u0930\u094d\u200d&#8205;}} ||\u1551||''-r''\n|-\n|{{lang|und-Deva|\u0935}} ||''va/wa''||{{lang|und-Deva|\u0935\u094d\u200d&#8205;}}||\u1424||''-w''\n|-\n|{{lang|und-Deva|\u25cc\u0903}} ||''-h''|| {{lang|und-Deva|\u25cc\u0903}}||\u1426||''-h''\n|}\n:<nowiki>*</nowiki>Cursive {{lang|und-Deva|\u0938}} is more similar to \u14f4, looking rather like {{lang|und-Deva|\u092e}}.\n\nIt is possible that ''-l'' and ''-r'' were derived through rotation from one Devanagari glyph, in the spirit of Pitman, where ''l'' and ''r'' are related in this way, rather than from the two different glyphs suggested by the table.\n\nIn contrast, the final consonants ''p t c k m n s'' and ''y'' (which Evans called \"final i\"), which are now only used for Western Cree, derive from Pitman shorthand. The linear glyphs \u144a \u141f \u1428 \u1420 ''p t c k'' are rotated 45\u00b0 from Pitman \u1420 \u144a \u141f \u1428 ''p t c k,'' but keep their relative orientations intact; the lunate glyphs \u14bc \u1423 \u1422 ''m n s'' are rotated 90\u00b0 from Pitman \u1422 \u14d1 \u1423 ''m n s.'' The Cree \"final i\" was originally a dot, as was the diacritic for the vowel ''i'' in Pitman.<ref>''[http://www.languagegeek.com/typography/syllabics/syl1.html Some General Aspects of the Syllabics Orthography],'' Chris Harvey 2003</ref>\n\n:{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Pitman source of {{nowrap|final Cree consonants}}\n! colspan=2| Pitman\n! colspan=2| Cree\n|-\n| style=\"width:4em;\" | \u1420 || style=\"width:4em;\" | p\n| style=\"width:4em;\" | \u144a || style=\"width:4em;\" | -p\n|-\n| \u144a ||t\n| \u141f ||-t\n|-\n| \u141f ||ch\n| \u1428 ||-c\n|-\n| \u1428 ||k\n| \u1420 ||-k\n|-\n| \u1422 ||m\n| \u14bc ||-m\n|-\n| \u1421 ||n\n| \u1423 ||-n\n|-\n| \u1423 ||s\n| \u1422 ||-s\n|-\n| \u02d9 ||i\n| \u02d9 ||-y\n|}\n\nThe final ''hk,'' however, is \u157d, a small version of the Greek letter [[Chi (letter)|\u03a7]] ''kh'', chosen because \u03a7 is a [[logogram]] for Christ.<ref>Dalby (1998) ''Dictionary of Languages''</ref>\n\nThe use of rotation to change the vowel of a syllable is unique to Canadian syllabics, but had its antecedent in shorthand. Pitman used rotation to change [[place of articulation]]: plosives ''p t ch k,'' nasals ''m n,'' and fricatives ''h s sh f th'' were all related through rotation, as can be partially seen in the table of finals above.\n\nInitially, Evans indicated vowel length with light versus heavy lines (the feature used to indicate [[voiced consonant|voicing]] in Pitman); but this proved awkward in print, and by 1841 it was changed to broken lines for long vowels versus solid lines for short vowels.  Later Evans introduced the current practice of writing a dot above the syllable to indicate vowel length.\n\n===Adoption and use===\n[[File:Cree type proof.jpg|thumb|A modern typeface, [http://digital.lib.sfu.ca/islandora/object/bcpba:57 2005]]]\nThe local Cree community quickly took to this new writing system. Cree people began to use it to write messages on tree bark using burnt sticks, leaving messages out on hunting trails far from the mission. Evans believed that it was well adapted to Native Canadian languages, particularly the [[Algonquian languages]] with which he was familiar. He claimed that \"with some slight alterations\" it could be used to write \"every language from the Atlantic to the Rocky Mountains.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tiro.com/syllabics/James_Evans/Rossville/Rossville.html|title=Rossville, 1840|last=|first=|date=|website=www.tiro.com|publisher=Tiro Typeworks|access-date=2017-01-07}}</ref>\n\nEvans attempted to secure a [[printing press]] and new [[Typesetting|type]] to publish materials in this writing system.  Here, he began to face resistance from colonial and European authorities.  The [[Hudson's Bay Company]], which had a monopoly on foreign commerce in western Canada, refused to import a press for him, believing that native literacy was something to be discouraged. Evans, with immense difficulty, constructed his own press and type and began publishing in syllabics.\n[[File:Moses roberts syllabics.JPG|thumb|A 1901 gravestone from Saskatchewan that included some writing in syllabics.]]\n\nEvans left Canada in 1846 and died shortly thereafter. However, the ease and utility of syllabic writing ensured its continued survival, despite European resistance to supporting it. In 1849, the [[Anglican]] bishop of [[Rupert's Land]] reported that \"a few of the Indians can read by means of these syllabic characters; but if they had only been taught to read their own language in our letters, it would have been one step towards the acquisition of the English tongue.\"  But syllabics had taken root among the Cree (indeed, their rate of literacy was greater than that of English and French Canadians<ref>Suzanne McCarthy, \"The Cree Syllabary and the Writing System Riddle\", in Taylor and Olson, eds, ''Scripts and Literacy,'' p. 59</ref>), and in 1861, fifteen years after Evans had died, the [[British and Foreign Bible Society]] published a [[Bible]] in [[Cree syllabics]].<ref name=cree_bible>[http://www.albertasource.ca/methodist/Pictures/Cree_Bible1.htm Methodist Bible in Cree syllabics]</ref>  By then, both [[Protestant]] and [[Catholic]] [[missionaries]] were using and actively propagating syllabic writing.\n\nMissionary work in the 1850s and 1860s spread syllabics to western Canadian [[Ojibwe language|Ojibwe]] dialects ([[Plains Ojibwe]] and [[Saulteaux]]), but it was not often used over the border by Ojibwe in the [[United States]].  Missionaries who had learned Evans' system spread it east across [[Ontario]] and into [[Quebec]], reaching all [[Cree language]] areas as far east as the [[Naskapi]].  [[Attikamekw]], [[Innu people|Montagnais]] and [[Innu]] people in eastern [[Quebec]] and [[Labrador]] use [[Latin script|Latin alphabets]].\n\nIn 1856, [[John Horden]], an Anglican missionary at [[Moose Factory, Ontario]], who adapted syllabics to the local [[James Bay Cree]] dialect, met a group of [[Inuit]] from the region of [[Grande Rivi\u00e8re de la Baleine]] in northern Quebec.  They were very interested in adapting [[Cree syllabics]] to their language.  He prepared a few based on their pronunciation of [[Inuktitut]], but it quickly became obvious that the number of basic sounds and the simple model of the syllable in the Evans system was inadequate to the language.  With the assistance of [[Edwin Arthur Watkins]], he dramatically modified syllabics to reflect these needs.\n\nIn 1876, the [[Anglican church]] hired [[Edmund Peck]] to work full-time in their mission at [[Kuujjuarapik, Quebec|Great Whale River]], teaching syllabics to the [[Inuit]] and translating materials into syllabics.  His work across the [[Arctic]] is usually credited with the establishment of syllabics among the Inuit.  With the support of both [[Anglican]] and [[Catholic]] missionary societies, by the beginning of the 20th century the Inuit were propagating syllabics themselves.\n\nIn the 1880s, [[John William Tims]], an Anglican missionary from [[Great Britain]], invented a number of new forms to write the [[Blackfoot language]].\n\n[[French people|French]] [[Roman Catholic]] missionaries were the primary force for expanding syllabics to [[Athabaskan languages]] in the late 19th century.  The [[Oblate (religion)|Oblate]] missionary order was particularly active in using syllabics in missionary work.  Oblate father [[Adrien-Gabriel Morice]] adapted syllabics to [[Dakelh]], inventing a large number of new basic characters to support the radically more complicated phonetics of Athabaskan languages.  Father [[\u00c9mile Petitot]] developed syllabic scripts for many of the Athabaskan languages of the [[Northwest Territories]], including [[Slavey language|Slavey]] and [[Chipewyan]].\n\nCree influenced the design of the [[Pollard script]] in China.<ref name=pollard>Joakim Enwall (1994) ''A Myth Become Reality: History and Development of the Miao Written Language.''</ref>\n\n==Syllabic alphabets==\nThe inventory, form, and orthography of the script vary among all the Cree communities which use it. However, it was further modified to create specific alphabets for other [[Algonquian languages]], as well as for [[Inuktitut|Inuit]], which have significant phonological differences from Cree. There are two major variants of the script, Central Algonquian and Inuktitut. In addition, derivative scripts for [[Blackfoot language|Blackfoot]] and [[Athabaskan]] inherit at least some principals and letter forms from the Central Algonquian alphabet, though in Blackfoot most of the letters have been replaced with modified Latin. Each reflects a historical expansion of the writing system.\n\n===Central Algonquian===\n{{Main|Western Cree syllabics|Eastern Cree syllabics}}\nCree and Ojibwe were the languages for which syllabics were designed, and they are the closest to the original pattern described by James Evans. The dialects differ slightly in their consonants, but where they share a sound, they generally use the same letter for it.  Where they do not, a new letter was created, often by modifying another. In several Cree dialects ''\u00ea'' has merged with the ''\u00ee'', and these use only three of the four vowel orientations.\n\n====Eastern and western syllabics====\nWhen syllabics spread to Ojibwe and to those Cree dialects east of the Manitoba-Ontario border, a few changes occurred. For one, the diacritic used to mark non-final ''w'' moved from its position after the syllable to before it; thus western Cree {{angle bracket|\u14b7}} is equivalent to the eastern Cree {{angle bracket|\u14b6}} \u2013 both are pronounced ''mwa.'' Secondly, the special final forms of the consonants were replaced with superscript variants of the corresponding ''a'' series in Moose Cree and Moose Cree influenced areas, so that {{angle bracket|\u140a\u1483}} is ''ak''  and {{angle bracket|\u14f4\u1449}} ''sap'' (graphically \"a<sup>ka</sup>\" and \"sa<sup>pa</sup>\"), rather than {{angle bracket|\u140a\u1420}} and {{angle bracket|\u14f4\u144a}}; among some of the Ojibwe communities superscript variants of the corresponding ''i'' series are found, especially in handwritten documents. Cree dialects of the western provinces preserve the Pitman-derived finals of the original script, though final ''y'' has become the more salient {{angle bracket|\u1429}}, to avoid confusion with the various dot diacritics. Additional consonant series are more pervasive in the east.\n\n:{| class=wikitable style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Finals\n|-\n! style=\"width:4em;\" | &nbsp;\n! style=\"width:4em;\" | West\n! style=\"width:4em;\" | West (Fort Severn)\n! style=\"width:4em;\" | West (Island Lake)\n! style=\"width:4em;\" | West (Sandy Lake)\n! style=\"width:4em;\" | East (A-finals)\n! style=\"width:4em;\" | East (I-finals)\n|-\n!

In a Roman Catholic variant, ''r-'' is a normal asymmetric form, derived by adding a stroke to ''c-,'' but ''l-'' shows an irregular pattern: Despite being asymmetrical, the forms are rotated only 90\u00b0, and ''li'' is a mirror image of what would be expected; it is neither an inversion nor a reflection of ''le,'' as in the other series, but rather a 180\u00b0 rotation.\n:''Some western additions''\n::{|\n| \u158b || \u158a || &emsp; || ri || re || &emsp; || (final \u1646)\n|-\n| \u158d || \u158c || &emsp; || ra || ro ||\n|}\n\n::{|\n| || ''\u1546'' || || &emsp; || || ''li'' || ||\n|-\n| '''\u154d''' || || \u154a || || '''la''' || || lo || &nbsp; || (final \u1506)\n|-\n| || \u1543 || || || || le || ||\n|}<!--This value for 'le' comes from Daniels & Bright 1996.

''R-'' is an inversion of the form of western ''l-,'' but now it is ''re'' that has the unexpected orientation. ''L-'' and ''f-'' are regular asymmetric and symmetric forms; although ''f-'' is actually asymmetric in form, it is derived from ''p-'' and therefore rotates 90\u00b0 as ''p-'' does. Here is where the two algorithms to derive vowel orientations, which are equivalent for the symmetrical forms of the original script, come to differ: For the \u1559 ''f-'' series, as well as a rare \u1566 ''th-'' series derived from \u1455 ''t-,'' vowels of like height are derived via counter-clockwise rotation; however, an eastern ''sh-'' series, which perhaps not coincidentally resembles a Latin ''s,'' is rotated ''clockwise'' with the opposite vowel derivations: high ''-i'' from low ''-a'' and lower ([[mid vowel|mid]]) ''-e'' from higher (mid) ''-o.'' The obsolete ''sp-'' series shows this to be the original design of the script, but Inuktitut, perhaps generalizing from the \u1559 series, which originated as \u1438 plus a circle at the start of the stroke used to write the letters, but as an independent form must be rotated in the opposite (counter-clockwise) direction, is consistently counter-clockwise. (The eastern Cree ''r-'' series can be seen as both of these algorithms applied to ''ro'' (bold), whereas western Cree ''l-'' can be seen as both applied to ''la'' (bold).)\n\n:''Some eastern additions''\n::{|\n| \u14d5 || \u14d3 || &emsp; || li || le\n|-\n| \u14da || \u14d7 || &emsp; || la || lo\n|}\n\n::{|\n| || \u1546 || || &emsp; || || ri || || &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\n| || || \u1511 || || &emsp; || || \u0161i || || &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\n| || || \u1555 || || &emsp; || || fi || || &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\n| || || \u1560 || || &emsp; || || \u00f0i ||\n|-\n| \u154b || || '''\u1548''' || || ra || || '''ro''' || ||\n| \u1515 || || \u1513 || || \u0161a || || \u0161o || ||\n| \u1559 || || \u1557 || || fa || || fo || ||\n| \u1566 || || \u1564 || || \u00f0a || || \u00f0o ||\n|-\n| || ''\u1543'' || || || || ''re'' || ||\n| || || \u1510 || || || || \u0161e || ||\n| || || \u1553 || || || || fe || ||\n| || || \u155e || || || || \u00f0e ||\n|}\n\nThere are minor variants within both eastern and western Cree. Woods Cree, for example, uses western Cree conventions, but has lost the ''e'' series, and has an additional consonant series, {{angle bracket|\u167e}}<!--On come computer displays, the barred \u27e8\u1429\u27e9 character for \"\u00f0\" at U+167E and the stemless \u27e8\u15b4\u27e9 character for \"w\" at U+167F are transposed.--> ''th- (\u00f0-),'' which is a barred form of the ''y-'' series.\n\n::{|\n| \u15a8 ||  || &emsp; || thi ||\n|-\n| \u15ac || \u15aa || &emsp; || tha || tho\n|}\n\nMoose Cree, which uses eastern Cree conventions, has an ''-sk'' final that is composed of ''-s'' and ''-k,'' as in \u140a\u14a5\u1509 ''amisk'' \"beaver\", and final ''-y'' is written with a superscript ring, {{angle bracket|\u00b0}}, rather than a superscript ''ya,'' which preserves, in a more salient form, the distinct final form otherwise found only in the west: \u140b\u1515\u030a ''\u0101shay'' \"now\".\n\nThe Eastern Cree dialect has distinct [[labialization|labialized]] finals, {{angle bracket|\u1484}} ''-kw'' and {{angle bracket|\u14bd}} ''-mw''; these are written with raised versions of the o-series rather than the usual a-series, as in \u14a5\u1505\u144e\u1484 ''mistikw'' \"tree\". This is motivated by the fact that the vowel ''o'' labializes the preceding consonant.\n\nAlthough in most respects [[Naskapi]] follows eastern Cree conventions, it does not mark vowel length at all and uses two dots, either placed above or before a syllable, to indicate a ''w'': {{angle bracket|\u141b}} ''wa,'' {{angle bracket|\u1416}} ''wo,'' {{angle bracket|\u1465}} ''twa,'' {{angle bracket|\u1482}} ''kwa,'' {{angle bracket|\u14a0}} ''cwa'' ({{IPA|/tswa/}}), {{angle bracket|\u14ba}} ''mwa,'' {{angle bracket|\u14cf}} ''nwa,'' {{angle bracket|\u1504}} ''swa,'' {{angle bracket|\u153d}} ''ywa.'' Since Naskapi ''s-'' consonant clusters are all labialized, ''sCw-,'' these also have the two dots: {{angle bracket|\u150c}} ''spwa, etc.'' There is also a labialized final sequence, {{angle bracket|\u150a}} ''-skw,'' which is a raised ''so-ko.''\n\nSee also:\n* [[Ojibwe writing systems#Ojibwe syllabics|Ojibwe syllabics]]\n* [[Oji-Cree language]]\n\n===Inuktitut===\n{{Main|Inuktitut syllabics}}\nThe eastern form of Cree syllabics was adapted to write the [[Inuktitut]] dialects of [[Nunavut]] (except for the extreme west, including [[Kugluktuk, Nunavut|Kugluktuk]] and [[Cambridge Bay, Nunavut|Cambridge Bay]]) and [[Nunavik]] in northern [[Quebec]]. In other Inuit areas, various Latin alphabets are used.\n\nInuktitut has only three vowels, and thus only needs the ''a-, i-,'' and ''o''-series of Cree, the latter used for {{IPA|/u/}}. The ''e''-series was originally used for the common [[diphthong]] {{IPA|/ai/}}, but this was officially dropped in the 1960s so that Inuktitut would not have more characters than could be moulded onto an [[IBM Selectric typewriter]] ball, with ''-ai'' written as an ''a''-series syllable followed by {{angle bracket|\u1403}} ''i.''  Recently the [[Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami]] decided to restore the ai-series, and the [[Makivik Corporation]] has adopted this use in [[Nunavik]]; it has not been restored in [[Nunavut]].\n\nInuktitut has more consonants than Cree, fifteen in its standardised form. As Inuktitut has no {{IPA|/ts/}}, the ''c'' series has been reassigned to the value ''g'' ({{IPA|/\u0261 ~ \u0263/}}). The ''y'' series is used for either ''y-'' or ''j-,'' since the difference is one of dialect; similarly with the ''s'' series, which stands for either ''s-'' or ''h-'', depending on the dialect. The eastern Cree ''l'' series is used: {{angle bracket|\u14da}} ''la,'' {{angle bracket|\u14d7}} ''lu,'' {{angle bracket|\u14d5}} ''li,'' {{angle bracket|\u14d3}} ''lai;'' a stroke is added to these to derive the voiceless ''lh'' ({{IPA|/\u026c/}}) series: {{angle bracket|\u15a4}} ''lha, etc.'' The eastern Cree ''f'' series is used for Inuktitut ''v-'': {{angle bracket|\u1559}} ''va, etc.'' The eastern Cree ''r'' series is used for the very different Inuktitut sound, {{IPA|/\u0262 ~ \u0281/}}, which is also spelled ''r''. However, this has been regularized in form, with vowels of like height consistently derived through counter-clockwise rotation, and therefore ''rai'' the inversion of ''ri'':\n\n::{|\n| || \u1546 || || &emsp; || || ri ||\n|-\n| \u154b || || \u1548 || || ra || || ru\n|-\n| || \u1542 || || || || rai ||\n|}\n\nThe remaining sounds are written with [[Digraph (orthography)|digraphs]]. A raised ''ra'' is prefixed to the k-series to create a digraph for ''q'': {{angle bracket|\u1583}} ''qa, etc.''; the final is {{angle bracket|\u1585}} ''-q.'' A raised ''na-ga'' is prefixed to the g-series to create an ''ng'' ({{IPA|/\u014b/}}) series: {{angle bracket|\u1593}} ''nga, etc.,'' and the ''na'' is doubled for geminate ''nng'' ({{IPA|/\u014b\u02d0/}}): {{angle bracket|\u1675}} ''nnga.''\nThe finals are {{angle bracket|\u1595}} and {{angle bracket|\u1596}}.\n\nIn Nunavut, the ''h'' final has been replaced with Roman {{angle bracket|\u157c}}, which does not rotate, but in Nunavik a new series is derived by adding a stroke to the k-series: {{angle bracket|\u1579}} ''ha, etc.''\n\nIn the early years, [[Roman Catholic]] and [[Anglican]] missionaries used slightly different forms of syllabics for Inuktitut.  In modern times, however, these differences have disappeared.  Dialectical variation across the syllabics-using part of the Inuit world has promoted an implicit diversity in spelling, but for the most part this has not had any impact on syllabics itself.\n\n==Derived scripts==\nAt least two scripts derive from Cree syllabics, and share its principles, but have fundamentally different letter shapes or sound values.\n\n===Blackfoot===\n{{Main|Blackfoot language#Writing System|l1=Blackfoot syllabics}}\n[[Blackfoot language|Blackfoot]], another Algonquian language, uses a syllabary that is quite different from the Cree and Inuktitut versions. Although borrowing from Cree the ideas of rotated and mirrored glyphs with final variants, most of the letter forms derive from the Latin script, with only some resembling Cree letters. Blackfoot has eight initial consonants, only two of which are identical in form to their Cree equivalents, {{angle bracket|\u14ef}} ''se'' and {{angle bracket|\u1528}} ''ye'' (here only the vowels have changed). The other consonants were created by modifying letters of the Latin script to make the ''e'' series, or in three cases by taking Cree letters but reassigning them with new sound values according to which Latin letters they resembled. These are {{angle bracket|\u146d}} ''pe'' (from {{angle bracket|P}}), {{angle bracket|\u14a5}} ''te'' (from {{angle bracket|T}}), {{angle bracket|\u15bc}} ''ke'' (from {{angle bracket|K}}), {{angle bracket|\u148b}} ''me'' (from {{angle bracket|m}}), {{angle bracket|\u15b8}} ''ne'' (from {{angle bracket|N}}), {{angle bracket|\u15b4}} ''we'' (from {{angle bracket|[[digamma|\u03dc]]}}). There are also a number of distinct final forms. The four vowel positions are used for the three vowels and one of the diphthongs of Blackfoot. The script is now obsolescent.\n\n===Carrier and other Athabaskan===\n{{Main|Carrier syllabics}}\n[[File:Carrierprayerbook.png|thumb|250px|A page from a prayer book written in the [[Carrier syllabics]], an Athabascan adaptation of Canadian Aboriginal syllabic writing]]\n\nAthabaskan syllabic scripts were developed in the late 19th century by French Roman Catholic missionaries, who adapted this originally Protestant writing system to languages radically different from the Algonquian languages.  Most [[Athabaskan languages]] have more than four distinct vowels, and all have many more distinct consonants than Cree.  This has meant the invention of a number of new consonant forms. Whereas most Athabaskan scripts, such as those for [[Slavey language|Slavey]] and [[Chipewyan language|Chipewyan]], bear a reasonably close resemblance to Cree syllabics, the [[Carrier language|Carrier]] ([[Dakelh]]) variant is highly divergent, and only one series \u2013 the series for vowels alone \u2013 resembles the original Cree form.\n\nTo accommodate six distinctive vowels, Dakelh supplements the four vowel orientations with a dot and a horizontal line in the rightward pointing forms: \u140a ''a'', \u1405 ''\u028c'', \u1408 ''e'', \u1409 ''i'', \u1403 ''o'', and \u1401 ''u''.\n\nOne of the Chipewyan scripts is more faithful to western Cree. ([[Sayisi Dene|Sayisi Chipewyan]] is substantially more divergent.) It has the nine forms plus the western ''l'' and ''r'' series, though the rotation of the ''l-'' series has been made consistently counter-clockwise. The ''k-'' and ''n-'' series are more angular than in Cree: ''ki'' resembles Latin \"P\". The ''c'' series has been reassigned to ''dh''. There are additional series: a regular ''ch'' series (\u15f4 ''cha'', \u15ef ''che'', \u15f0 ''chi'', \u15f1 ''cho''), graphically a doubled ''t''; and an irregular ''z'' series, where ''ze'' is derived by counter-clockwise rotation of ''za'', but ''zi'' by clockwise rotation of ''zo'':\n\n::{|\n| || \u161b || || &emsp; || || zi ||\n|-\n| \u1614 || || \u1615 || || za || || zo ||\n|-\n| || \u161a || || || || ze ||\n|}\n\nOther series are formed from ''dh'' or ''t''. A mid-line final Cree ''t'' preceding ''dh'' forms ''th,'' a raised Cree final ''p'' following ''t'' forms ''tt,'' a stroke inside ''t'' forms ''tth'' (\u156e ''ttha''), and a small ''t'' inside ''t'' forms ''ty'' (\u1573 ''tya''). Nasal vowels are indicated by a following Cree final ''k.''\n\nAll Athabaskan syllabic scripts are now obsolescent. {{citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=June 2016}}\n\n===Pollard script===\n{{Main|Pollard script}}\nThe Pollard script, also known as Pollard Miao is an abugida invented by Methodist missionary Samuel Pollard. Pollard credited the basic idea of the script to the Cree syllabics, saying, \"While working out the problem, we remembered the case of the syllabics used by a Methodist missionary among the Indians of North America, and resolved to do as he had done\".<ref>{{Citation | last       = Pollard | first      = Samuel | year       = 1919 | title      = Story of the Miao | publisher  = Henry Hooks| publication-place = London | page       = 174 | url        = | accessdate =  }}</ref>\n\n==Current usage==\n[[File:Tummivut Building.jpg|thumb|Syllabics is a co-official script in the territory of [[Nunavut]], and is used by the territorial government, as here.]]{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2017}}\nAt present, Canadian syllabics seems reasonably secure within the Cree, Oji-Cree, and Inuit communities, somewhat more at risk among the Ojibwe, seriously endangered for Athabaskan languages and Blackfoot.\n\nIn [[Nunavut]] and [[Nunavik]], Inuktitut syllabics have official status. In Nunavut, laws, legislative debates and many other government documents must be published in Inuktitut in both syllabics and the Latin script.  The rapid growth in the scope and quantity of material published in syllabics has, by all appearances, ended any immediate prospect of marginalisation for this writing system.\n\nWithin the Cree and Ojibwe language communities, the situation is less confident.\n\nCree syllabics use is vigorous in most communities where it has taken root.  In many dialect areas, there are now standardised syllabics spellings.  Nonetheless, there are now linguistically adequate standardised Roman writing systems for most if not all dialects.\n\nOjibwe speakers in the US have never been heavy users of either Canadian Aboriginal syllabics or the [[Great Lakes Aboriginal syllabics]] and have now essentially ceased to use either of them at all.  The \"double vowel\" Roman orthography developed by Charles Fiero and further developed by John Nichols is increasingly the standard in the USA and is beginning to penetrate into Canada, in part to prevent further atomisation of what is already a minority language.  Nonetheless, Ojibwe syllabics are still in vigorous use in some parts of Canada.\n\nUse in other communities is moribund.\n\nBlackfoot syllabics have, for all intents and purposes, disappeared. Present day Blackfoot speakers use a Latin alphabet, and very few Blackfoot can still read\u2014much less write\u2014the syllabic system.\n\nAmong the Athabaskan languages, no syllabics script is in vigorous use.  In some cases, the languages themselves are on the brink of extinction.  In other cases, syllabics has been replaced by a Latin alphabet. Many people\u2014linguists and speakers of Athabaskan languages alike\u2014feel that syllabics is ill-suited to these languages. The government of the Northwest Territories does not use syllabic writing for any of the Athabaskan languages on its territory, and native churches have generally stopped using them as well.  Among Dakelh users, a well-developed Latin alphabet has effectively replaced syllabics, which are now understood almost exclusively by elderly members of the community.\n\nIn the past, government policy towards syllabics has varied from indifference to open hostility. Until quite recently{{when|date=September 2011}}, government policy in Canada openly undermined native languages, and church organisations were often the only organised bodies using syllabics. Later, as governments became more accommodating of native languages, and in some cases even encouraged their use, it was widely believed that moving to a Latin alphabet was better, both for linguistic reasons and to reduce the cost of supporting multiple scripts.\n\nAt present, at least for Inuktitut and Algonquian languages, Canadian government tolerates, and in some cases encourages, the use of syllabics.  The growth of Aboriginal nationalism in Canada and the devolution of many government activities to native communities has changed attitudes towards syllabics.  In many places there are now standardisation bodies for syllabic spelling, and the Unicode standard supports a fairly complete set of Canadian syllabic characters for digital exchange. Syllabics are now taught in schools in Inuktitut-speaking areas, and are often taught in traditionally syllabics-using Cree and Ojibwe communities as well.\n\nAlthough syllabic writing is not always practical (on the Internet, for example), and in many cases a Latin alphabet would be less costly to use, many native communities are strongly attached to syllabics. Even though it was originally the invention of European missionaries, many people consider syllabics a writing system that belongs to them, and associate Latin letters to linguistic assimilation.\n\n==Unified Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics in Unicode==\n{{main|Unified Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics (Unicode block)|Unified Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics Extended|l2=Unified Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics Extended (Unicode block)}}\n\nThe bulk of the characters, including all that are found in official documents, are encoded into the two blocks in the [[Unicode]] standard:\n* [[Unified Canadian Aboriginal syllabics (Unicode block)|Unified Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics]] (U+1400\u2013U+167F)\n* [[Unified Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics Extended]] (U+18B0\u2013U+18FF)\nThese characters can be rendered with any appropriate font, including the freely available fonts [[#Free font downloads|listed below]].\n{{Unicode chart Unified Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics}}\n{{Unicode chart Unified Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics Extended}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Canada}}\n*[[Inuktitut syllabics]]\n*[[Inuktitut writing]]\n*[[Cree syllabics]]\n*[[Ojibwe writing systems#Ojibwe syllabics|Ojibwe syllabics]]\n*[[Carrier syllabics]]\n*[[Kamloops Wawa]]\n*[[Mi'kmaq hieroglyphic writing]]\n*[[Cherokee syllabary]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Refbegin}}\n*Comrie, Bernard. 2005. \"Writing systems.\" Martin Haspelmath, Matthew Dryer, David Gile, Bernard Comrie,  eds.

They are also used to write [[Inuktitut]] in the eastern Canadian Arctic; there they are co-official with the [[Latin script]] in the territory of [[Nunavut]]. They are used regionally for the other large Canadian Algonquian language, [[Ojibwe language|Ojibwe]], as well as for [[Blackfoot language|Blackfoot]], where they are obsolete.{{clarify|reason=Are they used or obsolete?|date=June 2019}} Among the [[Athabaskan languages]] further to the west, syllabics have been used at one point or another to write [[Carrier language|Dakelh]] (Carrier), [[Chipewyan language|Chipewyan]], [[Slavey language|Slavey]], [[T\u0142\u0131\u0328ch\u01eb]] (Dogrib) and [[Dane-zaa]] (Beaver). Syllabics have occasionally been used in the [[United States]] by communities that straddle the border, but are principally a [[Canadians|Canadian]] phenomenon.\n\n==Basic principles==\nCanadian \"syllabic\" scripts are not [[syllabary|syllabaries]], in which every consonant\u2013vowel sequence has a separate glyph,<ref>For example, in a true syllabary ''pi'' would have no graphic connection to ''pa.''</ref> but [[abugida]]s,<ref>Bernard Comrie, 2005, \"Writing Systems\", in Haspelmath et al. eds, ''The World Atlas of Language Structures'' (p 568 ''ff).'' Also Robert Bringhurst, 2004, ''The solid form of language: an essay on writing and meaning''. Comrie and Bringhurst use the term ''alphasyllabic,'' but the terms are essentially synonymous.</ref> in which consonants are modified in order to indicate an associated vowel&mdash;in this case through a change in orientation, which is unique to Canadian syllabics. In Cree, for example, the consonant ''p'' has the shape of a chevron. In an upward orientation, \u1431, it transcribes the syllable ''pi''. Inverted, so that it points downwards, \u142f, it transcribes ''pe''. Pointing to the left, \u1438, it is ''pa,'' and to the right, \u1433, ''po''. The consonant forms and the vowels so represented vary from language to language, but generally approximate their Cree origins.<ref name=nichols/>\n\n[[File:Evans 1841 Cree script.jpg|325px|thumb|Evans' script, as published in 1841.

Indeed, computer fonts have separate coding points for each syllable (each orientation of each consonant), and the [[Unicode Consortium]] considers syllabics to be a \"featural syllabary\" along with such scripts as [[hangul]], where each block represents a syllable, but consonants and vowels are indicated independently (in Cree syllabics, the consonant by the shape of a glyph, and the vowel by its orientation). This is unlike a true syllabary, where each combination of consonant and vowel has an independent form that is unrelated to other syllables with the same consonant or vowel.<ref>[http://www.cesarkallas.net/arquivos/livros/informatica/unicode/ch06.pdf The Unicode Standard, Version 4.0], 2003:149</ref>\n\n===Syllabic and final consonant forms===\nThe original script, which was designed for Western Swampy Cree, had ten such letter-forms: Eight for syllables based on the consonants ''p-, t-, c-, k-, m-, n-, s-, y-'' (pronounced /p, t, ts, k, m, n, s, j/), another for [[zero consonant|vowel-initial syllables]], and finally a blended form, now obsolete, for the consonant cluster ''sp-''. In the 1840 version, all were written with a light line to show the vowel was short and a heavier line to show the vowel was long: \u1472 ''ka'', '''\u1472''' ''k\u00e2''; however, in the 1841 version, a light line indicated minuscules (\"[[Type case|lowercase]]\") and a heavier line indicated majuscules ([[Type case|\"uppercase\"]]): \u1472 ''ka'', '''\u1472''' ''KA'' or ''Ka''; additionally in the 1841 version, complete letter-form indicated a short vowel, but for a long vowel Evans had notched the [[Sort (typesetting)|sort face]] such that in print the letter-form was broken\u2014a hand-written variant, an [[overdot]] for vowel length, is now used in printing as well: \u1455 ''ta'', \u1456 ''t\u00e2''. One consonant, ''w,'' had no letter form of its own but was indicated by a diacritic on another syllable; this is because it could combine with any of the consonants, as in \u147f ''kwa,'' as well as existing on its own, as in \u1418 ''wa''.<ref name=nichols/>\n\nThere were distinct letters for the nine consonants ''-p, -t, -c, -k, -m, -n, -s, -y,'' and ''w,'' when they occurred at the end of a syllable.In addition, four \"final\" consonants had no syllabic forms: ''-h, -l, -r,'' and the sequence ''-hk.'' These were originally written midline, but are now superscripted. (The glyph for ''-hk'' represents the most common final sequence of the language, being a common grammatical ending in Cree, and was used for common ''-nk'' in Ojibwe.) The consonants ''-l'' and ''-r'' were marginal, only found in borrowings, baby talk, and the like. These, and ''-h'', could occur before vowels, but were written with the final shape regardless. (''-l'' and ''-r'' are now written the size of full letters when they occur before vowels, as the finals were originally, or in some syllabics scripts have been replaced with full rotating syllabic forms; ''-h'' only occurs before a vowel in joined morphemes, in couple grammatical words, or in pedagogical materials to indicate the consonant value following it is a [[Fortis (linguistics)|fortis]].)<ref name=nichols/>\n\n===Vowel transformations===\n[[File:Ojibwe-Syllabics-Centennial-park.JPG|thumb|The orientation of a perfectly symmetrical vowel triangle may be difficult to discern. In the type of this Ojibwe sign, left-pointing ''a'' is an [[isosceles]] right-angled triangle, but upright ''i'' is acute-angled and [[isosceles]].]]\nThe vowels fall into two sets, the [[back vowel]]s ''-a'' and ''-u,'' and the [[front vowel]]s ''-e'' and ''-i.'' Each set consists of a [[vowel height|lower vowel]], ''-a'' or ''-e,'' and a higher vowel, ''-u'' or ''-i.'' In all cases, back-vowel syllables are related through left-right reflection: that is, they are mirror images of each other. How they relate to front-vowel syllables depends on the graphic form of the consonants. These follow two patterns. Symmetrical,<ref>Symmetrical forms are those for which rotating the ''a'' or ''u'' series by 180\u00b0 and a mirror-image reflection produce the same result, so that some other transformation is required to produce additional orientations.</ref> ''vowel, p-, t-, sp-,'' are rotated 90 degrees (a quarter turn) counter-clockwise, while those that are asymmetrical top-to-bottom, ''c-, k-, m-, n-, s-, y-,'' are rotated 180 degrees (a half turn). The lower front-vowel (''-e'') syllables are derived this way from the low back-vowel (''a'') syllables, and the high front-vowel (''-i'') syllables are derived this way from the higher back-vowel (''-u'') syllables.<ref name=nichols/><ref>For the asymmetrical forms in Evans' original system, this is equivalent to inverting (flipping upside down) the ''-a'' syllables to get the ''-i'' syllables, and the ''-u'' syllables to get the ''-e'' syllables; and for the symmetric forms, rotating 90 degrees ''clockwise'' for the same vowel correspondences. That appears to be how Evans designed the script, but this algorithm does not work for consonants added later on when syllabics was adapted for other Cree dialects or for other languages such as Inuktitut.</ref>\n\nThe symmetrical letter forms can be illustrated by arranging them into a diamond:\n\n::{|\n| || \u1403 || || &emsp; || || i || || &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\n| || \u1431 || || &emsp; || || bi/pi ||  || &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\n| || \u144e || || || || ti/di ||\n|-\n| \u140a || || \u1405 || || a || || o ||&nbsp;\n| \u1438 || || \u1433 || || ba/pa ||  || bo/po ||&nbsp;\n| \u1455 || || \u1450 || || ta/da ||  || to/do\n|-\n| || \u1401 || || || || e || || &nbsp;\n| || \u142f || || || || be/pe ||  || &nbsp;\n| || \u144c || || || || te/de ||\n|}\n\nAnd the asymmetrical letter forms can be illustrated by arranging them into a square:\n\n::{|\n| \u146d || \u146b || &emsp; || gi/ki || ge/ke ||&nbsp;\n| \u148b || \u1489 || &emsp; || ji/ci || je/ce ||\n| \u14a5 || \u14a3 || &emsp; || mi || me ||\n| \u14c2 || \u14c0 || &emsp; || ni || ne ||\n| \u14ef || \u14ed || &emsp; || si || se ||\n| \u1528 || \u1526 || &emsp; || yi || ye ||\n|-\n| \u1472 || \u146f || &emsp; || ga/ka || go/ko ||&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\n| \u1490 || \u148d || &emsp; || ja/ca || jo/co ||&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\n| \u14aa || \u14a7 || &emsp; || ma || mo ||&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\n| \u14c7 || \u14c4 || &emsp; || na || no ||&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\n| \u14f4 || \u14f1 || &emsp; || sa || so ||&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\n| \u152d || \u152a || &emsp; || ya || yo ||&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\n|}\n\nThese forms are present in most syllabics scripts with sounds values that approach their Swampy Cree origins. For example, all scripts except the one for Blackfoot use the triangle for vowel-initial syllables.\n\nBy 1841, when Evans cast the first movable type for syllabics, he found that he could not satisfactorily maintain the distinction between light and heavy typeface for short and long vowels. He instead filed across the raised lines of the type, leaving gaps in the printed letter for long vowels. This can be seen in early printings. Later still a dot diacritic, originally used for vowel length only in handwriting, was extended to print: Thus today \u140a ''a'' contrasts with \u140b ''\u00e2,'' and \u14a5 ''mi'' contrasts with \u14a6 ''m\u00ee''. Although Cree ''\u00ea'' only occurs long, the script made length distinctions for all four vowels. Not all writers then or now indicate length, or do not do so consistently; since there is no contrast, no one today writes ''\u00ea'' as a long vowel.<ref name=nichols/>\n\n===Pointing===\nReflecting the shorthand principles on which it was based, syllabics may be written ''plain'', indicating only the basic consonant\u2013vowel outline of speech, or ''pointed'', with diacritics for vowel length and the consonants {{IPA|/w/}} and {{IPA|/h/}}. Full phonemic pointing is rare. Syllabics may also be written without [[word divider|word division]], as Devanagari once was, or with spaces or dots between words or prefixes.<ref name=nichols/>\n\n===Punctuation===\nThe only punctuation found in many texts is spacing between words and \u166e for a full stop. Punctuation from the Latin script, including the period (.), may also be used.<ref name=nichols/> Due to the final ''c'' resembling a hyphen, a [[double hyphen]] {{angle bracket|\u1400}}<!-- U+1400 --> is used as the Canadian Aboriginal syllabics hyphen.\n\n==Glossary==\nSome common terms as used in the context of syllabics\n\n===\"Syllables\", or full-size letters===\n\nThe full-sized characters, whether standing for consonant-vowel combinations or vowels alone, are usually called \"syllables\". They may be [[phoneme|phonemic]] rather than [[morphophonemic]] syllables. That is, when one [[morpheme]] (word element) ends in a consonant and the next begins with a vowel, the intermediate consonant is written as a syllable with the following vowel.  For example, the Plains Cree word ''p\u012bhc-\u0101yi-hk'' \"indoors\" has ''p\u012bhc'' as its first morpheme, and ''\u0101yi'' as its second, but is written \u1432\u1426\u1491\u1528\u157d ''p\u012bh-c\u0101-yihk.''\n\nIn other cases, a \"syllable\" may in fact represent only a consonant, again due to the underlying structure of the language. In Plains Cree, \u1456\u14c2\u14ef ''t\u0101nisi'' \"hello\" or \"how are you?\" is written as if it had three syllables.  Because the first syllable has the stress and the syllable that follows has a short {{IPA|/i/}}, the vowel is dropped.  As a result, the word is pronounced \"t\u0101nsi\" with only two syllables.\n\nSyllabication is important to determining stress in Algonquian languages, and vice versa, so this ambiguity in syllabics is relatively important in Algonquian languages.\n\n====Series====\n[[File:Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics\u2014SH-series variations.png|thumb|Presentations style variations of the Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics SH-series in commonly available typefaces.]]\nThe word \"series\" is used for either a set of syllables with the same vowel, or a set with the same initial consonant.  Thus the n-series is the set of syllables that begin with ''n,'' and the o-series is the set of syllables that have ''o'' as their vowel regardless of their initial consonant.\n\n===\"Finals\", or reduced letters===\n\nA series of small raised letters are called \"finals\". They are usually placed after a syllable to indicate a final consonant, as the \u157d ''-hk'' in \u1528\u157d ''yihk'' above. However, the Cree consonant ''h,'' which only has a final form, begins a small number of function words such as \u1426\u140b\u1424  ''h\u0101w.''  In such cases the \"final\" \u1426 represents an ''initial'' consonant and therefore precedes the syllable.\n\nThe use of diacritics to write consonants is unusual in abugidas. However, it also occurs (independently) in the [[Lepcha script]].\n\nFinals are commonly employed in the extension of syllabics to languages it was not initially designed for. In some of the Athabaskan alphabets, finals have been extended to appear at mid height after a syllable, lowered after a syllable, and at mid height before a syllable.  For example, Chipewyan and Slavey use the final \u141f in the latter position to indicate the initial consonant ''dl'' ({{IPA|/\u026e/}}).\n\nIn Naskapi, a small raised letter based on ''sa'' is used for [[consonant cluster]]s that begin with /s/: \u150c ''spwa,'' \u150d ''stwa,'' \u150e ''skwa,'' and \u150f ''scwa.'' The Cree languages the script was initially designed for had no such clusters.\n\nIn Inuktitut, something similar is used not to indicate sequences, but to represent additional consonants, rather as the [[Digraph (orthography)|digraphs]] ''ch, sh, th'' were used to extend the Latin letters ''c, s, t'' to represent additional consonants in English. In Inuktitut, a raised ''na-ga'' is placed before the ''g-'' series, \u158f \u1591 \u1593, to form an ''ng-'' ({{IPA|/\u014b/}}) series, and a raised ''ra'' (uvular {{IPA|/\u0281/}}) is placed before syllables of the ''k-'' series, \u157f \u1581 \u1583, to form a uvular ''q-'' series.\n\nAlthough the forms of these series have two parts, each is encoded into the Unicode standard as a single character.\n\n===Diacritics===\n\nOther marks placed above or beside the syllable are called \"diacritics\".  These include the dot placed above a syllable to mark a long vowel, as in \u14a6 ''m\u00ee,'' and the dot placed at mid height after the syllable (in western Cree dialects) or before the syllable (in eastern Cree dialects) to indicate a medial ''w,'' as in \u147f ''kwa.'' These are all encoded as single characters in Unicode.\n\nDiacritics used by other languages include a ring above on Moose Cree \u146c ''kay'' (encoded as \"kaai\"), head ring on Ojibwe \u1553 ''fe'', head barb on Inuktitut \u15a4 ''lha'', tail barb on West Cree \u158c ''ro'', centred stroke (a small vertical bar) in Carrier \u15c7 ''ghee'', centred dot in Carrier \u15c8 ''ghi'', centred bar (a bar perpendicular to the body) in Cree \u15a8 ''thi'', and a variety of other marks.  Such diacritics may or may not be separately encoded into Unicode.  There is no systematic way to distinguish elements that are parts of syllables from diacritics, or diacritics from finals, and academic discussions of syllabics are often inconsistent in their terminology.\n\n====Points and pointing====\n\nThe diacritic mark used to indicate vowel length is often referred to as a \"point\".  Syllabics users do not always consistently mark vowel length, ''w,'' or ''h.''  A text with these marked is called a\n\"pointed\" text; one without such marks is said to be \"unpointed\".\n\n===Syllabaries and syllabics===\nThe word ''syllabary'' has two meanings: a writing system with a separate character for each syllable, but also a table of syllables, including any script arranged in a syllabic chart. Evans' Latin Ojibwe alphabet, for example, was presented as a syllabary. Canadian Aboriginal ''syllabics'', the script itself, is thus distinct from a syllabary (syllabic chart) that displays them.\n\n===Round and Square===\n[[File:Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics\u2014Round-form and Square-form.jpg|thumb|Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics\u2014Round form and Square form comparison]]\n\nWhile Greek, Latin, and Cyrillic have [[Serif]] and [[Sans-Serif]] forms, Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics generally do not. Instead, like the [[Proportional font|Proportional]] and [[Monospace font]]s, Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics have a Round form and a Square form.  Round form, known in Cree as ''K\u00e2-w\u00e2wiy\u00eayaki'', is akin to a Proportional font, characterised their smooth bowls, differing letter heights, and occupying a rectangular space.  Round form syllabics are more commonly found east of [[Lake Winnipeg]].  Square form, known in Cree as ''K\u00e2-ayisaw\u00eayaki'', is akin to a Monospace font, characterised by their cornered bowls, same letter heights, and occupying a square space.  Square form syllabics are more commonly found west of Lake Winnipeg.\n\n==History==\n{{Alphabet}}\nCree syllabics were created in a process that culminated in 1840 by [[James Evans (linguist)|James Evans]], a missionary, and mistan\u00e2skow\u00eaw, a Cree (Badger Calling, - from mistanask \u14a5\u1422\u1455\u14c7\u1422\u1420 'badger' and -w\u00eaw \u1401\u1427\u1424 'voice/call').<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Stevenson|first1=Winona|title=Calling Badger and the Symbols of the Spirit Language: The Cree Origins of the Syllabic System|journal=Oral History Forum|date=1999\u20132000|volume=19-20|pages=19\u201324}}</ref> Evans formalized them for [[Swampy Cree]] and [[Ojibwe language|Ojibwe]]. Evans had been inspired by the success of [[Sequoyah|Sequoyah's]] [[Cherokee syllabary]] after encountering problems with Latin-based alphabets, and drew on his knowledge of [[Devanagari]] and shorthand. Canadian syllabics would in turn influence the [[Pollard script]] in China.<ref name=nichols>John Nichols, 1996. \"The Cree Syllabary\". In Daniels & Bright, ''The World's Writing Systems'', p 599''ff''</ref> Other missionaries were reluctant to use it, but it was rapidly indigenized and spread to new communities before missionaries arrived. Some scholars assert that the Cree created a legend after 1840 that Canadian syllabics originated from Cree culture.<ref>Verne Dusenberry, 1962. ''The Montana Cree: A Study in Religious Persistence'' (Acta Universitatis Stockholmiensis 3). p 267\u2013269</ref> Cree scholar Winona Stevenson explores the possibility that the inspiration for Cree syllabics may have originated from a near-death experience of \u14a5\u1422\u1455\u14c7\u1422\u1420\u1401\u1427\u1424 mistan\u00e2skow\u00eaw. Stevenson references Fine Day cited in Mandelbaum's ''The Plains Cree'' who states that he learned the syllabary from Strikes-him-on-the-back who learned it directly from \u14a5\u1422\u1455\u14c7\u1422\u1420\u1401\u1427\u1424 mistan\u00e2skow\u00eaw <ref>{{cite journal|last1=Stevenson|first1=Winona|title=Calling Badger and the Symbols of the Spirit Language: The Cree Origins of the Syllabic System|journal=Oral History Forum|date=1999\u20132000|volume=19-20|pages=19\u201324}}</ref>\n\n===James Evans===\nIn 1827, Evans, a missionary from [[Kingston upon Hull|Kingston upon Hull, England]], was placed in charge of the [[Wesleyan]] mission at [[Rice Lake (Ontario)|Rice Lake, Ontario]].  Here, he began to learn the eastern [[Ojibwe language]] spoken in the area and was part of a committee to devise a [[Latin script|Latin alphabet]] for it. By 1837 he had prepared the ''Speller and Interpreter in English and Indian,'' but was unable to get its printing sanctioned by the [[British and Foreign Bible Society]]. At the time, many missionary societies were opposed to the development of native literacy in their own languages, believing that their situation would be bettered by linguistic assimilation into colonial society.\n\nEvans continued to use his [[Ojibwe writing systems#Evans system|Ojibwe orthography]] in his work in Ontario. As was common at the time, the [[orthography]] called for hyphens between the syllables of words, giving written Ojibwe a partially syllabic structure. However, his students appear to have had conceptual difficulties using the same alphabet for two different languages with very different sounds, and Evans himself found this approach awkward. Furthermore, the Ojibwe language was [[polysynthesis|polysynthetic]] but had few distinct syllables, meaning that most words had a large number of syllables; this made them quite long when written with the Latin script. He began to experiment with creating a more syllabic script that he thought might be less awkward for his students to use.\n\nIn 1840, Evans was relocated to [[Norway House, Manitoba|Norway House]] in northern [[Manitoba]].  Here he began learning the local [[Swampy Cree language|Swampy Cree]] dialect. Like [[Ojibwe language|Ojibwe]], to which it was quite closely related, it was full of long polysyllabic words.\n\nAs an amateur linguist, Evans was acquainted with the [[Devanagari]] script used in [[British India]]; in Devanagari, each letter stands for a syllable, and is modified to represent the vowel of that syllable. Such a system, now called an [[abugida]], readily lent itself to writing a language such as Swampy Cree, which had a simple syllable structure of only eight consonants and four long or short vowels. Evans was also familiar with British shorthand, presumably Samuel Taylor's ''[[Taylor shorthand|Universal Stenography]],'' from his days as a merchant in England; and now he acquired familiarity with the newly published [[Pitman shorthand]] of 1837.\n\n===Origins===\nBoth Devanagari and Pitman played a role in the development of Cree syllabics.<ref>Andrew Dalby (2004:139) ''Dictionary of Languages''</ref> Devanagari provided the glyphs for the syllables, whereas Pitman provided the glyphs for the final consonants, as well as the idea of rotation and line weight to modify the syllables.\n\nIn the original Evans script, there were ten syllabic forms: eight for the consonants ''p'', ''t'', ''c'', ''k'', ''m'', ''n'', ''s'', ''y''; a ninth for vowel-initial syllables or vowels following one of the incidental consonants; and a tenth, which is no longer in use, for the consonant cluster ''sp''. There were four incidental consonants, ''r'', ''l'', ''w'', ''h'', which did not have syllabic forms. Except for ''sp'', these can all be traced to the cursive combining forms of the corresponding Devanagari ''akshara;'' the Devanagari combining form is somewhat abbreviated (the right-side stroke is dropped), and in handwriting the running horizontal line may be left off as well, as has been standardized in [[Gujar\u0101ti script|Gujarati]]. (The sequence ''sp'' appears to be a conflation of the shape of ''s'' with the angularity of ''p'', along the conceptual lines of the more contracted [[Typographic ligature|ligature]]s of Devanagari such as {{lang|und-Deva|\u0915\u094d\u0937}}.)\n\nThe likeness is stronger if one allows the symbols to rotate to give a similar direction of writing for each vowel; for example, Devanagari ''n'' has the orientation of ''ne'' rather than of ''na''.\nThe motivation for the change of orientation appears to have been to allow the pen to trace the same direction when writing syllables with the same vowels: The reflection class ''ka'', ''ca'', ''ma'', ''sa'', ''ya'' (that is, the consonants that are flipped to distinguish the front ''i'', ''e'' vowels) all follow an L-like path, whereas the rotation class ''a'', ''pa'', ''ta'', ''na'' (those rotated for the front vowels) all follow a C-like path. The orientation of Devanagari ''g-'' (for ''k-''), ''n-'', ''y-'', and possibly ''s-'' had to be flipped for this to happen. (''Sp-'' does not follow this generalization, reflecting its hybrid origin.)\n\nBecause Cree consonants can be either [[voiced consonant|voiced]] or voiceless, depending on their environment, each corresponds to two Devanagari letters, and Cree ''ka''/''ga'', for example, resembles Devanagari ''g'' rather than ''k''. The consonant ''h'', which only occurs as a final in syllabics, appears to derive from the Devanagari [[visarga]], {{lang|und-Deva|\u25cc\u0903}} ''\u1e25'', which also occurs only as a final, rather than from syllabic {{lang|und-Deva|\u0939}} ''ha''.\n[[File:Nagari-syllabics.png|thumb|upright|right|Devanagari combining forms compared to syllabics]]\n:{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ {{nowrap|Devanagari source of initial and}} independent Cree consonants\n!colspan=3|Devanagari full<br />and [[Devanagari#Conjuncts|half form]]s!!colspan=2|Cree\n|-\n|colspan=5|''Syllables''\n|-\n| style=\"width:4em;\" | {{lang|und-Deva|\u090f}} || style=\"width:4em;\" | ''e''|| style=\"width:4em;\" | {{lang|und-Deva|\u090f}} || style=\"width:4em;\" | \u1401 || style=\"width:4em;\" | ''e''\n|-\n|{{lang|und-Deva|\u092a}} ||''pa''||{{lang|und-Deva|\u092a\u094d\u200d&#8205;}}||\u1438||''pa/ba''\n|-\n|{{lang|und-Deva|\u091f}} ||''\u1e6da''||{{lang|und-Deva|\u091f\u200d&#8205;}}||\u1455||''ta/da''\n|-\n|{{lang|und-Deva|\u091c}} ||''ja''||{{lang|und-Deva|\u091c\u094d\u200d&#8205;}}||\u1490||''cha/ja''\n|-\n|{{lang|und-Deva|\u0917}} ||''ga''||{{lang|und-Deva|\u0917\u094d\u200d&#8205;}}||\u146f||''ko/go''\n|-\n|{{lang|und-Deva|\u092e}} ||''ma''||{{lang|und-Deva|\u092e\u094d\u200d&#8205;}}||\u14aa||''ma''\n|-\n|{{lang|und-Deva|\u0928}} ||''na''||{{lang|und-Deva|\u0928\u094d\u200d&#8205;}}||\u14c2||''ne''\n|-\n|{{lang|und-Deva|\u0938}} ||''sa''||{{lang|und-Deva|\u0938\u094d\u200d&#8205;}}||\u14f4||''sa''*\n|-\n|{{lang|und-Deva|\u092f}} ||''ya''||{{lang|und-Deva|\u092f\u094d\u200d&#8205;}}||\u152a||''yo''\n|-\n|colspan=5|''Incidental consonants''\n|-\n|{{lang|und-Deva|\u0932}} ||''la''||{{lang|und-Deva|\u0932\u094d\u200d&#8205;}}||\u14eb||''-l''\n|-\n|{{lang|und-Deva|\u0930}} ||''ra''|| {{lang|und-Deva|\u0930\u094d\u200d&#8205;}} ||\u1551||''-r''\n|-\n|{{lang|und-Deva|\u0935}} ||''va/wa''||{{lang|und-Deva|\u0935\u094d\u200d&#8205;}}||\u1424||''-w''\n|-\n|{{lang|und-Deva|\u25cc\u0903}} ||''-h''|| {{lang|und-Deva|\u25cc\u0903}}||\u1426||''-h''\n|}\n:<nowiki>*</nowiki>Cursive {{lang|und-Deva|\u0938}} is more similar to \u14f4, looking rather like {{lang|und-Deva|\u092e}}.\n\nIt is possible that ''-l'' and ''-r'' were derived through rotation from one Devanagari glyph, in the spirit of Pitman, where ''l'' and ''r'' are related in this way, rather than from the two different glyphs suggested by the table.\n\nIn contrast, the final consonants ''p t c k m n s'' and ''y'' (which Evans called \"final i\"), which are now only used for Western Cree, derive from Pitman shorthand. The linear glyphs \u144a \u141f \u1428 \u1420 ''p t c k'' are rotated 45\u00b0 from Pitman \u1420 \u144a \u141f \u1428 ''p t c k,'' but keep their relative orientations intact; the lunate glyphs \u14bc \u1423 \u1422 ''m n s'' are rotated 90\u00b0 from Pitman \u1422 \u14d1 \u1423 ''m n s.'' The Cree \"final i\" was originally a dot, as was the diacritic for the vowel ''i'' in Pitman.<ref>''[http://www.languagegeek.com/typography/syllabics/syl1.html Some General Aspects of the Syllabics Orthography],'' Chris Harvey 2003</ref>\n\n:{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Pitman source of {{nowrap|final Cree consonants}}\n! colspan=2| Pitman\n! colspan=2| Cree\n|-\n| style=\"width:4em;\" | \u1420 || style=\"width:4em;\" | p\n| style=\"width:4em;\" | \u144a || style=\"width:4em;\" | -p\n|-\n| \u144a ||t\n| \u141f ||-t\n|-\n| \u141f ||ch\n| \u1428 ||-c\n|-\n| \u1428 ||k\n| \u1420 ||-k\n|-\n| \u1422 ||m\n| \u14bc ||-m\n|-\n| \u1421 ||n\n| \u1423 ||-n\n|-\n| \u1423 ||s\n| \u1422 ||-s\n|-\n| \u02d9 ||i\n| \u02d9 ||-y\n|}\n\nThe final ''hk,'' however, is \u157d, a small version of the Greek letter [[Chi (letter)|\u03a7]] ''kh'', chosen because \u03a7 is a [[logogram]] for Christ.<ref>Dalby (1998) ''Dictionary of Languages''</ref>\n\nThe use of rotation to change the vowel of a syllable is unique to Canadian syllabics, but had its antecedent in shorthand. Pitman used rotation to change [[place of articulation]]: plosives ''p t ch k,'' nasals ''m n,'' and fricatives ''h s sh f th'' were all related through rotation, as can be partially seen in the table of finals above.\n\nInitially, Evans indicated vowel length with light versus heavy lines (the feature used to indicate [[voiced consonant|voicing]] in Pitman); but this proved awkward in print, and by 1841 it was changed to broken lines for long vowels versus solid lines for short vowels.  Later Evans introduced the current practice of writing a dot above the syllable to indicate vowel length.\n\n===Adoption and use===\n[[File:Cree type proof.jpg|thumb|A modern typeface, [http://digital.lib.sfu.ca/islandora/object/bcpba:57 2005]]]\nThe local Cree community quickly took to this new writing system. Cree people began to use it to write messages on tree bark using burnt sticks, leaving messages out on hunting trails far from the mission. Evans believed that it was well adapted to Native Canadian languages, particularly the [[Algonquian languages]] with which he was familiar. He claimed that \"with some slight alterations\" it could be used to write \"every language from the Atlantic to the Rocky Mountains.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tiro.com/syllabics/James_Evans/Rossville/Rossville.html|title=Rossville, 1840|last=|first=|date=|website=www.tiro.com|publisher=Tiro Typeworks|access-date=2017-01-07}}</ref>\n\nEvans attempted to secure a [[printing press]] and new [[Typesetting|type]] to publish materials in this writing system.  Here, he began to face resistance from colonial and European authorities.  The [[Hudson's Bay Company]], which had a monopoly on foreign commerce in western Canada, refused to import a press for him, believing that native literacy was something to be discouraged. Evans, with immense difficulty, constructed his own press and type and began publishing in syllabics.\n[[File:Moses roberts syllabics.JPG|thumb|A 1901 gravestone from Saskatchewan that included some writing in syllabics.]]\n\nEvans left Canada in 1846 and died shortly thereafter. However, the ease and utility of syllabic writing ensured its continued survival, despite European resistance to supporting it. In 1849, the [[Anglican]] bishop of [[Rupert's Land]] reported that \"a few of the Indians can read by means of these syllabic characters; but if they had only been taught to read their own language in our letters, it would have been one step towards the acquisition of the English tongue.\"  But syllabics had taken root among the Cree (indeed, their rate of literacy was greater than that of English and French Canadians<ref>Suzanne McCarthy, \"The Cree Syllabary and the Writing System Riddle\", in Taylor and Olson, eds, ''Scripts and Literacy,'' p. 59</ref>), and in 1861, fifteen years after Evans had died, the [[British and Foreign Bible Society]] published a [[Bible]] in [[Cree syllabics]].<ref name=cree_bible>[http://www.albertasource.ca/methodist/Pictures/Cree_Bible1.htm Methodist Bible in Cree syllabics]</ref>  By then, both [[Protestant]] and [[Catholic]] [[missionaries]] were using and actively propagating syllabic writing.\n\nMissionary work in the 1850s and 1860s spread syllabics to western Canadian [[Ojibwe language|Ojibwe]] dialects ([[Plains Ojibwe]] and [[Saulteaux]]), but it was not often used over the border by Ojibwe in the [[United States]].  Missionaries who had learned Evans' system spread it east across [[Ontario]] and into [[Quebec]], reaching all [[Cree language]] areas as far east as the [[Naskapi]].  [[Attikamekw]], [[Innu people|Montagnais]] and [[Innu]] people in eastern [[Quebec]] and [[Labrador]] use [[Latin script|Latin alphabets]].\n\nIn 1856, [[John Horden]], an Anglican missionary at [[Moose Factory, Ontario]], who adapted syllabics to the local [[James Bay Cree]] dialect, met a group of [[Inuit]] from the region of [[Grande Rivi\u00e8re de la Baleine]] in northern Quebec.  They were very interested in adapting [[Cree syllabics]] to their language.  He prepared a few based on their pronunciation of [[Inuktitut]], but it quickly became obvious that the number of basic sounds and the simple model of the syllable in the Evans system was inadequate to the language.  With the assistance of [[Edwin Arthur Watkins]], he dramatically modified syllabics to reflect these needs.\n\nIn 1876, the [[Anglican church]] hired [[Edmund Peck]] to work full-time in their mission at [[Kuujjuarapik, Quebec|Great Whale River]], teaching syllabics to the [[Inuit]] and translating materials into syllabics.  His work across the [[Arctic]] is usually credited with the establishment of syllabics among the Inuit.  With the support of both [[Anglican]] and [[Catholic]] missionary societies, by the beginning of the 20th century the Inuit were propagating syllabics themselves.\n\nIn the 1880s, [[John William Tims]], an Anglican missionary from [[Great Britain]], invented a number of new forms to write the [[Blackfoot language]].\n\n[[French people|French]] [[Roman Catholic]] missionaries were the primary force for expanding syllabics to [[Athabaskan languages]] in the late 19th century.  The [[Oblate (religion)|Oblate]] missionary order was particularly active in using syllabics in missionary work.  Oblate father [[Adrien-Gabriel Morice]] adapted syllabics to [[Dakelh]], inventing a large number of new basic characters to support the radically more complicated phonetics of Athabaskan languages.  Father [[\u00c9mile Petitot]] developed syllabic scripts for many of the Athabaskan languages of the [[Northwest Territories]], including [[Slavey language|Slavey]] and [[Chipewyan]].\n\nCree influenced the design of the [[Pollard script]] in China.<ref name=pollard>Joakim Enwall (1994) ''A Myth Become Reality: History and Development of the Miao Written Language.''</ref>\n\n==Syllabic alphabets==\nThe inventory, form, and orthography of the script vary among all the Cree communities which use it. However, it was further modified to create specific alphabets for other [[Algonquian languages]], as well as for [[Inuktitut|Inuit]], which have significant phonological differences from Cree. There are two major variants of the script, Central Algonquian and Inuktitut. In addition, derivative scripts for [[Blackfoot language|Blackfoot]] and [[Athabaskan]] inherit at least some principals and letter forms from the Central Algonquian alphabet, though in Blackfoot most of the letters have been replaced with modified Latin. Each reflects a historical expansion of the writing system.\n\n===Central Algonquian===\n{{Main|Western Cree syllabics|Eastern Cree syllabics}}\nCree and Ojibwe were the languages for which syllabics were designed, and they are the closest to the original pattern described by James Evans. The dialects differ slightly in their consonants, but where they share a sound, they generally use the same letter for it.  Where they do not, a new letter was created, often by modifying another. In several Cree dialects ''\u00ea'' has merged with the ''\u00ee'', and these use only three of the four vowel orientations.\n\n====Eastern and western syllabics====\nWhen syllabics spread to Ojibwe and to those Cree dialects east of the Manitoba-Ontario border, a few changes occurred. For one, the diacritic used to mark non-final ''w'' moved from its position after the syllable to before it; thus western Cree {{angle bracket|\u14b7}} is equivalent to the eastern Cree {{angle bracket|\u14b6}} \u2013 both are pronounced ''mwa.'' Secondly, the special final forms of the consonants were replaced with superscript variants of the corresponding ''a'' series in Moose Cree and Moose Cree influenced areas, so that {{angle bracket|\u140a\u1483}} is ''ak''  and {{angle bracket|\u14f4\u1449}} ''sap'' (graphically \"a<sup>ka</sup>\" and \"sa<sup>pa</sup>\"), rather than {{angle bracket|\u140a\u1420}} and {{angle bracket|\u14f4\u144a}}; among some of the Ojibwe communities superscript variants of the corresponding ''i'' series are found, especially in handwritten documents. Cree dialects of the western provinces preserve the Pitman-derived finals of the original script, though final ''y'' has become the more salient {{angle bracket|\u1429}}, to avoid confusion with the various dot diacritics. Additional consonant series are more pervasive in the east.\n\n:{| class=wikitable style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Finals\n|-\n! style=\"width:4em;\" | &nbsp;\n! style=\"width:4em;\" | West\n! style=\"width:4em;\" | West (Fort Severn)\n! style=\"width:4em;\" | West (Island Lake)\n! style=\"width:4em;\" | West (Sandy Lake)\n! style=\"width:4em;\" | East (A-finals)\n! style=\"width:4em;\" | East (I-finals)\n|-\n!

In a Roman Catholic variant, ''r-'' is a normal asymmetric form, derived by adding a stroke to ''c-,'' but ''l-'' shows an irregular pattern: Despite being asymmetrical, the forms are rotated only 90\u00b0, and ''li'' is a mirror image of what would be expected; it is neither an inversion nor a reflection of ''le,'' as in the other series, but rather a 180\u00b0 rotation.\n:''Some western additions''\n::{|\n| \u158b || \u158a || &emsp; || ri || re || &emsp; || (final \u1646)\n|-\n| \u158d || \u158c || &emsp; || ra || ro ||\n|}\n\n::{|\n| || ''\u1546'' || || &emsp; || || ''li'' || ||\n|-\n| '''\u154d''' || || \u154a || || '''la''' || || lo || &nbsp; || (final \u1506)\n|-\n| || \u1543 || || || || le || ||\n|}<!--This value for 'le' comes from Daniels & Bright 1996.

Here is where the two algorithms to derive vowel orientations, which are equivalent for the symmetrical forms of the original script, come to differ: For the \u1559 ''f-'' series, as well as a rare \u1566 ''th-'' series derived from \u1455 ''t-,'' vowels of like height are derived via counter-clockwise rotation; however, an eastern ''sh-'' series, which perhaps not coincidentally resembles a Latin ''s,'' is rotated ''clockwise'' with the opposite vowel derivations: high ''-i'' from low ''-a'' and lower ([[mid vowel|mid]]) ''-e'' from higher (mid) ''-o.'' The obsolete ''sp-'' series shows this to be the original design of the script, but Inuktitut, perhaps generalizing from the \u1559 series, which originated as \u1438 plus a circle at the start of the stroke used to write the letters, but as an independent form must be rotated in the opposite (counter-clockwise) direction, is consistently counter-clockwise. (The eastern Cree ''r-'' series can be seen as both of these algorithms applied to ''ro'' (bold), whereas western Cree ''l-'' can be seen as both applied to ''la'' (bold).)\n\n:''Some eastern additions''\n::{|\n| \u14d5 || \u14d3 || &emsp; || li || le\n|-\n| \u14da || \u14d7 || &emsp; || la || lo\n|}\n\n::{|\n| || \u1546 || || &emsp; || || ri || || &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\n| || || \u1511 || || &emsp; || || \u0161i || || &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\n| || || \u1555 || || &emsp; || || fi || || &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\n| || || \u1560 || || &emsp; || || \u00f0i ||\n|-\n| \u154b || || '''\u1548''' || || ra || || '''ro''' || ||\n| \u1515 || || \u1513 || || \u0161a || || \u0161o || ||\n| \u1559 || || \u1557 || || fa || || fo || ||\n| \u1566 || || \u1564 || || \u00f0a || || \u00f0o ||\n|-\n| || ''\u1543'' || || || || ''re'' || ||\n| || || \u1510 || || || || \u0161e || ||\n| || || \u1553 || || || || fe || ||\n| || || \u155e || || || || \u00f0e ||\n|}\n\nThere are minor variants within both eastern and western Cree. Woods Cree, for example, uses western Cree conventions, but has lost the ''e'' series, and has an additional consonant series, {{angle bracket|\u167e}}<!--On come computer displays, the barred \u27e8\u1429\u27e9 character for \"\u00f0\" at U+167E and the stemless \u27e8\u15b4\u27e9 character for \"w\" at U+167F are transposed.--> ''th- (\u00f0-),'' which is a barred form of the ''y-'' series.\n\n::{|\n| \u15a8 ||  || &emsp; || thi ||\n|-\n| \u15ac || \u15aa || &emsp; || tha || tho\n|}\n\nMoose Cree, which uses eastern Cree conventions, has an ''-sk'' final that is composed of ''-s'' and ''-k,'' as in \u140a\u14a5\u1509 ''amisk'' \"beaver\", and final ''-y'' is written with a superscript ring, {{angle bracket|\u00b0}}, rather than a superscript ''ya,'' which preserves, in a more salient form, the distinct final form otherwise found only in the west: \u140b\u1515\u030a ''\u0101shay'' \"now\".\n\nThe Eastern Cree dialect has distinct [[labialization|labialized]] finals, {{angle bracket|\u1484}} ''-kw'' and {{angle bracket|\u14bd}} ''-mw''; these are written with raised versions of the o-series rather than the usual a-series, as in \u14a5\u1505\u144e\u1484 ''mistikw'' \"tree\". This is motivated by the fact that the vowel ''o'' labializes the preceding consonant.\n\nAlthough in most respects [[Naskapi]] follows eastern Cree conventions, it does not mark vowel length at all and uses two dots, either placed above or before a syllable, to indicate a ''w'': {{angle bracket|\u141b}} ''wa,'' {{angle bracket|\u1416}} ''wo,'' {{angle bracket|\u1465}} ''twa,'' {{angle bracket|\u1482}} ''kwa,'' {{angle bracket|\u14a0}} ''cwa'' ({{IPA|/tswa/}}), {{angle bracket|\u14ba}} ''mwa,'' {{angle bracket|\u14cf}} ''nwa,'' {{angle bracket|\u1504}} ''swa,'' {{angle bracket|\u153d}} ''ywa.'' Since Naskapi ''s-'' consonant clusters are all labialized, ''sCw-,'' these also have the two dots: {{angle bracket|\u150c}} ''spwa, etc.'' There is also a labialized final sequence, {{angle bracket|\u150a}} ''-skw,'' which is a raised ''so-ko.''\n\nSee also:\n* [[Ojibwe writing systems#Ojibwe syllabics|Ojibwe syllabics]]\n* [[Oji-Cree language]]\n\n===Inuktitut===\n{{Main|Inuktitut syllabics}}\nThe eastern form of Cree syllabics was adapted to write the [[Inuktitut]] dialects of [[Nunavut]] (except for the extreme west, including [[Kugluktuk, Nunavut|Kugluktuk]] and [[Cambridge Bay, Nunavut|Cambridge Bay]]) and [[Nunavik]] in northern [[Quebec]]. In other Inuit areas, various Latin alphabets are used.\n\nInuktitut has only three vowels, and thus only needs the ''a-, i-,'' and ''o''-series of Cree, the latter used for {{IPA|/u/}}. The ''e''-series was originally used for the common [[diphthong]] {{IPA|/ai/}}, but this was officially dropped in the 1960s so that Inuktitut would not have more characters than could be moulded onto an [[IBM Selectric typewriter]] ball, with ''-ai'' written as an ''a''-series syllable followed by {{angle bracket|\u1403}} ''i.''  Recently the [[Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami]] decided to restore the ai-series, and the [[Makivik Corporation]] has adopted this use in [[Nunavik]]; it has not been restored in [[Nunavut]].\n\nInuktitut has more consonants than Cree, fifteen in its standardised form. As Inuktitut has no {{IPA|/ts/}}, the ''c'' series has been reassigned to the value ''g'' ({{IPA|/\u0261 ~ \u0263/}}). The ''y'' series is used for either ''y-'' or ''j-,'' since the difference is one of dialect; similarly with the ''s'' series, which stands for either ''s-'' or ''h-'', depending on the dialect. The eastern Cree ''l'' series is used: {{angle bracket|\u14da}} ''la,'' {{angle bracket|\u14d7}} ''lu,'' {{angle bracket|\u14d5}} ''li,'' {{angle bracket|\u14d3}} ''lai;'' a stroke is added to these to derive the voiceless ''lh'' ({{IPA|/\u026c/}}) series: {{angle bracket|\u15a4}} ''lha, etc.'' The eastern Cree ''f'' series is used for Inuktitut ''v-'': {{angle bracket|\u1559}} ''va, etc.'' The eastern Cree ''r'' series is used for the very different Inuktitut sound, {{IPA|/\u0262 ~ \u0281/}}, which is also spelled ''r''. However, this has been regularized in form, with vowels of like height consistently derived through counter-clockwise rotation, and therefore ''rai'' the inversion of ''ri'':\n\n::{|\n| || \u1546 || || &emsp; || || ri ||\n|-\n| \u154b || || \u1548 || || ra || || ru\n|-\n| || \u1542 || || || || rai ||\n|}\n\nThe remaining sounds are written with [[Digraph (orthography)|digraphs]]. A raised ''ra'' is prefixed to the k-series to create a digraph for ''q'': {{angle bracket|\u1583}} ''qa, etc.''; the final is {{angle bracket|\u1585}} ''-q.'' A raised ''na-ga'' is prefixed to the g-series to create an ''ng'' ({{IPA|/\u014b/}}) series: {{angle bracket|\u1593}} ''nga, etc.,'' and the ''na'' is doubled for geminate ''nng'' ({{IPA|/\u014b\u02d0/}}): {{angle bracket|\u1675}} ''nnga.''\nThe finals are {{angle bracket|\u1595}} and {{angle bracket|\u1596}}.\n\nIn Nunavut, the ''h'' final has been replaced with Roman {{angle bracket|\u157c}}, which does not rotate, but in Nunavik a new series is derived by adding a stroke to the k-series: {{angle bracket|\u1579}} ''ha, etc.''\n\nIn the early years, [[Roman Catholic]] and [[Anglican]] missionaries used slightly different forms of syllabics for Inuktitut.  In modern times, however, these differences have disappeared.  Dialectical variation across the syllabics-using part of the Inuit world has promoted an implicit diversity in spelling, but for the most part this has not had any impact on syllabics itself.\n\n==Derived scripts==\nAt least two scripts derive from Cree syllabics, and share its principles, but have fundamentally different letter shapes or sound values.\n\n===Blackfoot===\n{{Main|Blackfoot language#Writing System|l1=Blackfoot syllabics}}\n[[Blackfoot language|Blackfoot]], another Algonquian language, uses a syllabary that is quite different from the Cree and Inuktitut versions. Although borrowing from Cree the ideas of rotated and mirrored glyphs with final variants, most of the letter forms derive from the Latin script, with only some resembling Cree letters. Blackfoot has eight initial consonants, only two of which are identical in form to their Cree equivalents, {{angle bracket|\u14ef}} ''se'' and {{angle bracket|\u1528}} ''ye'' (here only the vowels have changed). The other consonants were created by modifying letters of the Latin script to make the ''e'' series, or in three cases by taking Cree letters but reassigning them with new sound values according to which Latin letters they resembled. These are {{angle bracket|\u146d}} ''pe'' (from {{angle bracket|P}}), {{angle bracket|\u14a5}} ''te'' (from {{angle bracket|T}}), {{angle bracket|\u15bc}} ''ke'' (from {{angle bracket|K}}), {{angle bracket|\u148b}} ''me'' (from {{angle bracket|m}}), {{angle bracket|\u15b8}} ''ne'' (from {{angle bracket|N}}), {{angle bracket|\u15b4}} ''we'' (from {{angle bracket|[[digamma|\u03dc]]}}). There are also a number of distinct final forms. The four vowel positions are used for the three vowels and one of the diphthongs of Blackfoot. The script is now obsolescent.\n\n===Carrier and other Athabaskan===\n{{Main|Carrier syllabics}}\n[[File:Carrierprayerbook.png|thumb|250px|A page from a prayer book written in the [[Carrier syllabics]], an Athabascan adaptation of Canadian Aboriginal syllabic writing]]\n\nAthabaskan syllabic scripts were developed in the late 19th century by French Roman Catholic missionaries, who adapted this originally Protestant writing system to languages radically different from the Algonquian languages.  Most [[Athabaskan languages]] have more than four distinct vowels, and all have many more distinct consonants than Cree.  This has meant the invention of a number of new consonant forms. Whereas most Athabaskan scripts, such as those for [[Slavey language|Slavey]] and [[Chipewyan language|Chipewyan]], bear a reasonably close resemblance to Cree syllabics, the [[Carrier language|Carrier]] ([[Dakelh]]) variant is highly divergent, and only one series \u2013 the series for vowels alone \u2013 resembles the original Cree form.\n\nTo accommodate six distinctive vowels, Dakelh supplements the four vowel orientations with a dot and a horizontal line in the rightward pointing forms: \u140a ''a'', \u1405 ''\u028c'', \u1408 ''e'', \u1409 ''i'', \u1403 ''o'', and \u1401 ''u''.\n\nOne of the Chipewyan scripts is more faithful to western Cree. ([[Sayisi Dene|Sayisi Chipewyan]] is substantially more divergent.) It has the nine forms plus the western ''l'' and ''r'' series, though the rotation of the ''l-'' series has been made consistently counter-clockwise. The ''k-'' and ''n-'' series are more angular than in Cree: ''ki'' resembles Latin \"P\". The ''c'' series has been reassigned to ''dh''. There are additional series: a regular ''ch'' series (\u15f4 ''cha'', \u15ef ''che'', \u15f0 ''chi'', \u15f1 ''cho''), graphically a doubled ''t''; and an irregular ''z'' series, where ''ze'' is derived by counter-clockwise rotation of ''za'', but ''zi'' by clockwise rotation of ''zo'':\n\n::{|\n| || \u161b || || &emsp; || || zi ||\n|-\n| \u1614 || || \u1615 || || za || || zo ||\n|-\n| || \u161a || || || || ze ||\n|}\n\nOther series are formed from ''dh'' or ''t''. A mid-line final Cree ''t'' preceding ''dh'' forms ''th,'' a raised Cree final ''p'' following ''t'' forms ''tt,'' a stroke inside ''t'' forms ''tth'' (\u156e ''ttha''), and a small ''t'' inside ''t'' forms ''ty'' (\u1573 ''tya''). Nasal vowels are indicated by a following Cree final ''k.''\n\nAll Athabaskan syllabic scripts are now obsolescent. {{citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=June 2016}}\n\n===Pollard script===\n{{Main|Pollard script}}\nThe Pollard script, also known as Pollard Miao is an abugida invented by Methodist missionary Samuel Pollard. Pollard credited the basic idea of the script to the Cree syllabics, saying, \"While working out the problem, we remembered the case of the syllabics used by a Methodist missionary among the Indians of North America, and resolved to do as he had done\".<ref>{{Citation | last       = Pollard | first      = Samuel | year       = 1919 | title      = Story of the Miao | publisher  = Henry Hooks| publication-place = London | page       = 174 | url        = | accessdate =  }}</ref>\n\n==Current usage==\n[[File:Tummivut Building.jpg|thumb|Syllabics is a co-official script in the territory of [[Nunavut]], and is used by the territorial government, as here.]]{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2017}}\nAt present, Canadian syllabics seems reasonably secure within the Cree, Oji-Cree, and Inuit communities, somewhat more at risk among the Ojibwe, seriously endangered for Athabaskan languages and Blackfoot.\n\nIn [[Nunavut]] and [[Nunavik]], Inuktitut syllabics have official status. In Nunavut, laws, legislative debates and many other government documents must be published in Inuktitut in both syllabics and the Latin script.  The rapid growth in the scope and quantity of material published in syllabics has, by all appearances, ended any immediate prospect of marginalisation for this writing system.\n\nWithin the Cree and Ojibwe language communities, the situation is less confident.\n\nCree syllabics use is vigorous in most communities where it has taken root.  In many dialect areas, there are now standardised syllabics spellings.  Nonetheless, there are now linguistically adequate standardised Roman writing systems for most if not all dialects.\n\nOjibwe speakers in the US have never been heavy users of either Canadian Aboriginal syllabics or the [[Great Lakes Aboriginal syllabics]] and have now essentially ceased to use either of them at all.  The \"double vowel\" Roman orthography developed by Charles Fiero and further developed by John Nichols is increasingly the standard in the USA and is beginning to penetrate into Canada, in part to prevent further atomisation of what is already a minority language.  Nonetheless, Ojibwe syllabics are still in vigorous use in some parts of Canada.\n\nUse in other communities is moribund.\n\nBlackfoot syllabics have, for all intents and purposes, disappeared. Present day Blackfoot speakers use a Latin alphabet, and very few Blackfoot can still read\u2014much less write\u2014the syllabic system.\n\nAmong the Athabaskan languages, no syllabics script is in vigorous use.  In some cases, the languages themselves are on the brink of extinction.  In other cases, syllabics has been replaced by a Latin alphabet. Many people\u2014linguists and speakers of Athabaskan languages alike\u2014feel that syllabics is ill-suited to these languages. The government of the Northwest Territories does not use syllabic writing for any of the Athabaskan languages on its territory, and native churches have generally stopped using them as well.  Among Dakelh users, a well-developed Latin alphabet has effectively replaced syllabics, which are now understood almost exclusively by elderly members of the community.\n\nIn the past, government policy towards syllabics has varied from indifference to open hostility. Until quite recently{{when|date=September 2011}}, government policy in Canada openly undermined native languages, and church organisations were often the only organised bodies using syllabics. Later, as governments became more accommodating of native languages, and in some cases even encouraged their use, it was widely believed that moving to a Latin alphabet was better, both for linguistic reasons and to reduce the cost of supporting multiple scripts.\n\nAt present, at least for Inuktitut and Algonquian languages, Canadian government tolerates, and in some cases encourages, the use of syllabics.  The growth of Aboriginal nationalism in Canada and the devolution of many government activities to native communities has changed attitudes towards syllabics.  In many places there are now standardisation bodies for syllabic spelling, and the Unicode standard supports a fairly complete set of Canadian syllabic characters for digital exchange. Syllabics are now taught in schools in Inuktitut-speaking areas, and are often taught in traditionally syllabics-using Cree and Ojibwe communities as well.\n\nAlthough syllabic writing is not always practical (on the Internet, for example), and in many cases a Latin alphabet would be less costly to use, many native communities are strongly attached to syllabics. Even though it was originally the invention of European missionaries, many people consider syllabics a writing system that belongs to them, and associate Latin letters to linguistic assimilation.\n\n==Unified Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics in Unicode==\n{{main|Unified Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics (Unicode block)|Unified Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics Extended|l2=Unified Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics Extended (Unicode block)}}\n\nThe bulk of the characters, including all that are found in official documents, are encoded into the two blocks in the [[Unicode]] standard:\n* [[Unified Canadian Aboriginal syllabics (Unicode block)|Unified Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics]] (U+1400\u2013U+167F)\n* [[Unified Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics Extended]] (U+18B0\u2013U+18FF)\nThese characters can be rendered with any appropriate font, including the freely available fonts [[#Free font downloads|listed below]].\n{{Unicode chart Unified Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics}}\n{{Unicode chart Unified Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics Extended}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Canada}}\n*[[Inuktitut syllabics]]\n*[[Inuktitut writing]]\n*[[Cree syllabics]]\n*[[Ojibwe writing systems#Ojibwe syllabics|Ojibwe syllabics]]\n*[[Carrier syllabics]]\n*[[Kamloops Wawa]]\n*[[Mi'kmaq hieroglyphic writing]]\n*[[Cherokee syllabary]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Refbegin}}\n*Comrie, Bernard. 2005. \"Writing systems.\" Martin Haspelmath, Matthew Dryer, David Gile, Bernard Comrie,  eds.

In his system, each symbol represents a [[syllable]] rather than a single [[phoneme]]; the 85 (originally 86){{sfn|Sturtevant|Fogelson|2004|p=337}} characters provide a suitable method to write Cherokee. Although some symbols resemble [[Latin alphabet|Latin]], [[Greek alphabet|Greek]], and [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] letters, they are not used to represent the same sounds.\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Sequoyah.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Sequoyah]], inventor of the Cherokee syllabary]]\nEach of the characters represents one syllable, as in the [[Japanese language|Japanese]] ''[[kana]]'' and the [[Bronze Age]] Greek [[Linear B]] writing systems. The first six characters represent isolated [[Cardinal vowel|vowel]] syllables. Characters for combined consonant and vowel syllables then follow.\n\nThe charts below show the syllabary in recitation order, left to right, top to bottom as arranged by [[Samuel Worcester]], along with his commonly used transliterations.{{Sfn | Walker | Sarbaugh | 1993 | pp = 72, 76}}{{Sfn | Giasson | 2004 | p = 42}} He played a key role in the development of [[Cherokee printing]] from 1828 until his death in 1859.\n\nThe transliteration working from the syllabary uses conventional consonants like ''qu, ts,...'', and may differ from the ones used in the phonological orthographies (first column in the below chart, in the \"d/t system\"). \n\n{| class=\"wikitable nounderlines\"\n| colspan=\"21\" style=\"font-size: smaller\" | ''The chart below uses [[Unicode]] characters from the [[Cherokee (Unicode block)|Cherokee]] block.''

The standard Digohweli font displays the modern form. Old Do Digohweli and Code2000 fonts both display the old form.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.languagegeek.com/font/fontdownload.html#Cherokee | title = Language geek font download | contribution = Cherokee}}</ref>}}\n\nThere is also a handwritten cursive form of the syllabary;<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.omniglot.com/writing/cherokee.htm|title=Cherokee language, writing system and pronunciation|at=sec. \"Hand-written Cherokee syllabary\"|website=[[Omniglot]]}}</ref> notably, the handwritten glyphs bear little resemblance to the printed forms.\n\n=== Detailed considerations ===\nThe phonetic values of these characters do not equate directly to those represented by the letters of the Latin script. Some characters represent two distinct phonetic values (actually heard as different syllables), while others may represent multiple variations of the same syllable.{{Sfn | Walker | Sarbaugh | 1993 | pp = 72\u201375}} Not all [[phoneme|phonemic]] distinctions of the spoken language are represented:\n*Aspirated consonants are generally not distinguished from their plain counterpart. For example, while {{IPA|/d/}} + vowel syllables are mostly differentiated from {{IPA|/t/}} + vowel by use of different [[glyph|glyphs]], syllables beginning with {{IPA|/\u0261w/}} are all conflated with those beginning with {{IPA|/kw/}}. \n* Long vowels are not distinguished from short vowels. However, in more recent technical literature, length of vowels can actually be indicated using a colon, and other disambiguation methods for consonants (somewhat like the [[Japanese language|Japanese]] [[dakuten]]) have been suggested.\n* Tones are not marked. \n* Syllables ending in vowels, ''h,'' or glottal stop are not differentiated.  For example, the single symbol \u13d1 is used to represent both ''su\u00fa'' as in ''su\u00fad\u00e1li'', meaning \"six\" (\u13d1\u13d3\u13b5), and ''s\u00fah'' as in ''s\u00fahdi,'' meaning \"fishhook\" (\u13d1\u13d7).\n* There is no regular rule for representing [[consonant clusters]]. When consonants other than ''s, h,'' or glottal stop arise in clusters with other consonants, a vowel must be inserted, chosen either arbitrarily or for etymological reasons (reflecting an underlying etymological vowel, see [[Cherokee language#Vowel deletion|vowel deletion]] for instance). For example, \u13e7\u13be\u13cd\u13d7 (tsu-na-s-di) represents the word '' juunsdi\u030b'', meaning \"small (pl.), babies\". The consonant cluster ''ns'' is broken down by insertion of the vowel ''a'', and is spelt as \u13be\u13cd {{IPA|/nas/}}. The vowel is etymological as ''juunsdi\u030b'' is composed of the morphemes ''di-uunii-'''a'''sdii\u030b\u0294i'' (DIST-3B.pl-small), where ''a'' is part of the root. The vowel is included in the transliteration, but is not pronounced.\n\nAs with some other underspecified writing systems (like [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]]), adult speakers can distinguish words by context.\n\nIf a labial consonant such as ''p'' or ''b'' appears in a borrowed word or name, it is written using the ''qu'' row. This {{IPA|/kw/}} ~ {{IPA|/p/}} correspondence is a known linguistic phenomenon that exists elsewhere (cf. [[P-Celtic]], [[Osco-Umbrian]]).\n\n=== Transliteration issues ===\nSome Cherokee words pose a problem for transliteration software because they contain adjacent pairs of single letter symbols that (without special provisions) would be combined when doing the back-conversion from Latin script to Cherokee. Here are a few examples:\n* \u13a2\u13e3\u13b5\u13cd\u13a0\u13c1\u13d7 = ''itsalisanedi'' = ''i-tsa-li-s-a-ne-di''\n* \u13a4\u13b5\u13a9\u13f3\u13cd\u13a0\u13c5\u13c1 = ''uligiyusanvne'' = ''u-li-gi-yu-s-a-nv-ne''\n* \u13a4\u13c2\u13f0\u13cd\u13a2\u13f1 = ''uniyesiyi'' = ''u-ni-ye-s-i-yi''\n* \u13be\u13cd\u13a2\u13ef = ''nasiya'' = ''na-s-i-ya''\nFor these examples, the back conversion is likely to join ''s-a'' as ''sa'' or ''s-i'' as ''si''. One solution is to use an apostrophe to separate the two,{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} as is done in Japanese (e.g.: [[Man'yogana]]): ''itsalis'anedi''.\n\nOther Cherokee words contain character pairs that entail overlapping transliteration sequences. Examples:\n* \u13c0\u13be transliterates as ''nahna'', yet so does \u13be\u13bf. The former is ''nah-na'', the latter is ''na-hna''.\nIf the Latin script is parsed from left to right, longest match first, then without special provisions, the back conversion would be wrong for the latter. There are several similar examples involving these character combinations: ''naha nahe nahi naho nahu nahv''.\n\nA further problem encountered in transliterating Cherokee is that there are some pairs of different Cherokee words that transliterate to the same word in the Latin script. Here are some examples:\n* \u13a0\u13cd\u13a1\u13c3 and \u13a0\u13ce\u13c3 both transliterate to ''aseno''\n* \u13a8\u13cd\u13a5\u13a2 and \u13a8\u13d2\u13a2 both transliterate to ''gesvi''\nWithout special provision, a round trip conversion may change \u13a0\u13cd\u13a1\u13c3 to \u13a0\u13ce\u13c3 and change \u13a8\u13cd\u13a5\u13a2 to \u13a8\u13d2\u13a2.\n\n==Character orders==\n[[File:Cherokee syllabary original order.png|thumb|Original Cherokee syllabary order, with the now obsolete letter \u13f5 in red]]\n* The usual alphabetical order for Cherokee runs across the rows of the syllabary chart from left to right, top to bottom\u2014this is the one used in the Unicode block: \u13a0 (a), \u13a1 (e), \u13a2 (i), \u13a3 (o), \u13a4 (u), \u13a5 (v), \u13a6 (ga), \u13a7 (ka), \u13a8 (ge), \u13a9 (gi), \u13aa (go), \u13ab (gu), \u13ac (gv), \u13ad (ha), \u13ae (he), \u13af (hi), \u13b0 (ho), \u13b1 (hu), \u13b2 (hv), \u13b3 (la), \u13b4 (le), \u13b5 (li), \u13b6 (lo), \u13b7 (lu), \u13b8 (lv), \u13b9 (ma), \u13ba (me), \u13bb (mi), \u13bc (mo), \u13bd (mu), \u13be (na), \u13bf (hna), \u13c0 (nah), \u13c1 (ne), \u13c2 (ni), \u13c3 (no), \u13c4 (nu), \u13c5 (nv), \u13c6 (qua), \u13c7 (que), \u13c8 (qui), \u13c9 (quo), \u13ca (quu), \u13cb (quv), \u13cc (sa), \u13cd (s), \u13ce (se), \u13cf (si), \u13d0 (so), \u13d1 (su), \u13d2 (sv), \u13d3 (da), \u13d4 (ta), \u13d5 (de), \u13d6 (te), \u13d7 (di), \u13d8 (ti), \u13d9 (do), \u13da (du), \u13db (dv), \u13dc (dla), \u13dd (tla), \u13de (tle), \u13df (tli), \u13e0 (tlo), \u13e1 (tlu), \u13e2 (tlv), \u13e3 (tsa), \u13e4 (tse), \u13e5 (tsi), \u13e6 (tso), \u13e7 (tsu), \u13e8 (tsv), \u13e9 (wa), \u13ea (we), \u13eb (wi), \u13ec (wo), \u13ed (wu), \u13ee (wv), \u13ef (ya), \u13f0 (ye), \u13f1 (yi), \u13f2 (yo), \u13f3 (yu), \u13f4 (yv).\n\n* Cherokee has also been alphabetized based on the six columns of the syllabary chart from top to bottom, left to right: \u13a0 (a), \u13a6 (ga), \u13a7 (ka), \u13ad (ha), \u13b3 (la), \u13b9 (ma), \u13be (na), \u13bf (hna), \u13c0 (nah), \u13c6 (qua), \u13cd (s), \u13cc (sa), \u13d3 (da), \u13d4 (ta), \u13dc (dla), \u13dd (tla), \u13e3 (tsa), \u13e9 (wa), \u13ef (ya), \u13a1 (e), \u13a8 (ge), \u13ae (he), \u13b4 (le), \u13ba (me), \u13c1 (ne), \u13c7 (que), \u13ce (se), \u13d5 (de), \u13d6 (te), \u13de (tle), \u13e4 (tse), \u13ea (we), \u13f0 (ye), \u13a2 (i), \u13a9 (gi), \u13af (hi), \u13b5 (li), \u13bb (mi), \u13c2 (ni), \u13c8 (qui), \u13cf (si), \u13d7 (di), \u13d8 (ti), \u13df (tli), \u13e5 (tsi), \u13eb (wi), \u13f1 (yi), \u13a3 (o), \u13aa (go), \u13b0 (ho), \u13b6 (lo), \u13bc (mo), \u13c3 (no), \u13c9 (quo), \u13d0 (so), \u13d9 (do), \u13e0 (tlo), \u13e6 (tso), \u13ec (wo), \u13f2 (yo), \u13a4 (u), \u13ab (gu), \u13b1 (hu), \u13b7 (lu), \u13bd (mu), \u13c4 (nu), \u13ca (quu), \u13d1 (su), \u13da (du), \u13e1 (tlu), \u13e7 (tsu), \u13ed (wu), \u13f3 (yu), \u13a5 (v), \u13ac (gv), \u13b2 (hv), \u13b8 (lv), \u13c5 (nv), \u13cb (quv), \u13d2 (sv), \u13db (dv), \u13e2 (tlv), \u13e8 (tsv), \u13ee (wv), \u13f4 (yv).\n\n* Sequoyah used a completely different alphabetical order: \u13a1 (e), \u13a0 (a), \u13b3 (la), \u13e5 (tsi), \u13c0 (nah), \u13ed (wu), \u13ea (we), \u13b5 (li), \u13c1 (ne), \u13bc (mo), \u13a9 (gi), \u13f1 (yi), \u13cf (si), \u13e2 (tlv), \u13a3 (o), \u13b7 (lu), \u13b4 (le), \u13ad (ha), \u13ec (wo), \u13e0 (tlo), \u13d4 (ta), \u13f4 (yv), \u13b8 (lv), \u13af (hi), \u13cd (s), \u13f2 (yo), \u13b1 (hu), \u13aa (go), \u13e7 (tsu), \u13bd (mu), \u13ce (se), \u13d0 (so), \u13df (tli), \u13c8 (qui), \u13c7 (que), \u13cc (sa), \u13c6 (qua), \u13c3 (no), \u13a7 (ka), \u13e8 (tsv), \u13d2 (sv), \u13c2 (ni), \u13a6 (ga), \u13d9 (do), \u13a8 (ge), \u13d3 (da), \u13ac (gv), \u13eb (wi), \u13a2 (i), \u13a4 (u), \u13f0 (ye), \u13b2 (hv), \u13db (dv), \u13ab (gu), \u13e6 (tso), \u13c9 (quo), \u13c4 (nu), \u13be (na), \u13b6 (lo), \u13f3 (yu), \u13e4 (tse), \u13d7 (di), \u13ee (wv), \u13da(du), \u13d5 (de), \u13e3 (tsa), \u13a5 (v), \u13c5 (nv), \u13d6 (te), \u13b9 (ma), \u13d1 (su), \u13e1 (tlu), \u13ae (he), \u13b0 (ho), \u13bb (mi), \u13dd (tla), \u13ef (ya), \u13e9 (wa), \u13d8 (ti), \u13de (tle), \u13bf (hna), \u13ca (quu), \u13dc (dla), \u13ba (me), \u13cb (quv).\n* And the usual order goes: \u13ef, \u13a3, \u13af, \u13b9, \u13c0, \u13e4, \u13da, \u13a4, \u13a0, \u13c8, \u13a2, \u13ea, \u13be, \u13e9, \u13d8, \u13dd, \u13ac, \u13ba, \u13cd, \u13a1, \u13df, \u13a8, \u13a5, \u13d4, \u13ee, \u13b0, \u13ed, \u13bc, \u13a7, \u13d0, \u13d6, \u13c4, \u13ad, \u13c6, \u13eb, \u13dc, \u13cb, \u13e7, \u13f3, \u13e8, \u13d7, \u13b2, \u13ca, \u13c7, \u13b3, \u13c5, \u13ae, \u13b1, \u13e3, \u13e9, \u13e6, \u13f1, \u13c2, \u13be, \u13bf, \u13f2, \u13de, \u13e1, \u13db, \u13e0,\n\n==Numerals==\nCherokee uses [[Arabic numerals]] (0\u20139).

He worked on the syllabary for twelve years before completion and dropped or modified most of the characters he originally created.\n\nAfter the syllabary was completed in the early 1820s, it achieved almost instantaneous popularity and spread rapidly throughout Cherokee society.{{Sfn | Walker | Sarbaugh | 1993 | p = 70\u201372}} By 1825, the majority of Cherokees could read and write in their newly developed orthography.{{Sfn | McLaughlin | 1986 | p = 353}}\n\nSome of Sequoyah's most learned contemporaries immediately understood that the syllabary was a great invention. For example, when [[Albert Gallatin]], a politician and trained linguist, saw a copy of Sequoyah's syllabary, he believed it was superior to the English alphabet.{{clarify|reason=Superior to English orthography or superior to the Latin alphabet??|date=May 2019}} He recognized that even though the Cherokee student must learn 85 characters instead of 26 for English, the Cherokee could read immediately after learning all the symbols. The Cherokee student could accomplish in a few weeks what students of English writing might require two years to achieve.<ref>Langguth, A. J. (2010).

The link appears to have been Cherokee who emigrated to Liberia after the invention of the Cherokee syllabary (which in its early years spread rapidly among the Cherokee) but before the inventions of the Vai syllabary. One such man, Austin Curtis, married into a prominent [[Vai people|Vai]] family and became an important Vai chief himself.

The standard Digohweli font displays the modern form. Old Do Digohweli and Code2000 fonts both display the old form.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.languagegeek.com/font/fontdownload.html#Cherokee | title = Language geek font download | contribution = Cherokee}}</ref>}}\n\nThere is also a handwritten cursive form of the syllabary;<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.omniglot.com/writing/cherokee.htm|title=Cherokee language, writing system and pronunciation|at=sec. \"Hand-written Cherokee syllabary\"|website=[[Omniglot]]}}</ref> notably, the handwritten glyphs bear little resemblance to the printed forms.\n\n=== Detailed considerations ===\nThe phonetic values of these characters do not equate directly to those represented by the letters of the Latin script. Some characters represent two distinct phonetic values (actually heard as different syllables), while others may represent multiple variations of the same syllable.{{Sfn | Walker | Sarbaugh | 1993 | pp = 72\u201375}} Not all [[phoneme|phonemic]] distinctions of the spoken language are represented:\n*Aspirated consonants are generally not distinguished from their plain counterpart. For example, while {{IPA|/d/}} + vowel syllables are mostly differentiated from {{IPA|/t/}} + vowel by use of different [[glyph|glyphs]], syllables beginning with {{IPA|/\u0261w/}} are all conflated with those beginning with {{IPA|/kw/}}. \n* Long vowels are not distinguished from short vowels. However, in more recent technical literature, length of vowels can actually be indicated using a colon, and other disambiguation methods for consonants (somewhat like the [[Japanese language|Japanese]] [[dakuten]]) have been suggested.\n* Tones are not marked. \n* Syllables ending in vowels, ''h,'' or glottal stop are not differentiated.  For example, the single symbol \u13d1 is used to represent both ''su\u00fa'' as in ''su\u00fad\u00e1li'', meaning \"six\" (\u13d1\u13d3\u13b5), and ''s\u00fah'' as in ''s\u00fahdi,'' meaning \"fishhook\" (\u13d1\u13d7).\n* There is no regular rule for representing [[consonant clusters]]. When consonants other than ''s, h,'' or glottal stop arise in clusters with other consonants, a vowel must be inserted, chosen either arbitrarily or for etymological reasons (reflecting an underlying etymological vowel, see [[Cherokee language#Vowel deletion|vowel deletion]] for instance). For example, \u13e7\u13be\u13cd\u13d7 (tsu-na-s-di) represents the word '' juunsdi\u030b'', meaning \"small (pl.), babies\". The consonant cluster ''ns'' is broken down by insertion of the vowel ''a'', and is spelt as \u13be\u13cd {{IPA|/nas/}}. The vowel is etymological as ''juunsdi\u030b'' is composed of the morphemes ''di-uunii-'''a'''sdii\u030b\u0294i'' (DIST-3B.pl-small), where ''a'' is part of the root. The vowel is included in the transliteration, but is not pronounced.\n\nAs with some other underspecified writing systems (like [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]]), adult speakers can distinguish words by context.\n\nIf a labial consonant such as ''p'' or ''b'' appears in a borrowed word or name, it is written using the ''qu'' row. This {{IPA|/kw/}} ~ {{IPA|/p/}} correspondence is a known linguistic phenomenon that exists elsewhere (cf. [[P-Celtic]], [[Osco-Umbrian]]).\n\n=== Transliteration issues ===\nSome Cherokee words pose a problem for transliteration software because they contain adjacent pairs of single letter symbols that (without special provisions) would be combined when doing the back-conversion from Latin script to Cherokee. Here are a few examples:\n* \u13a2\u13e3\u13b5\u13cd\u13a0\u13c1\u13d7 = ''itsalisanedi'' = ''i-tsa-li-s-a-ne-di''\n* \u13a4\u13b5\u13a9\u13f3\u13cd\u13a0\u13c5\u13c1 = ''uligiyusanvne'' = ''u-li-gi-yu-s-a-nv-ne''\n* \u13a4\u13c2\u13f0\u13cd\u13a2\u13f1 = ''uniyesiyi'' = ''u-ni-ye-s-i-yi''\n* \u13be\u13cd\u13a2\u13ef = ''nasiya'' = ''na-s-i-ya''\nFor these examples, the back conversion is likely to join ''s-a'' as ''sa'' or ''s-i'' as ''si''. One solution is to use an apostrophe to separate the two,{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} as is done in Japanese (e.g.: [[Man'yogana]]): ''itsalis'anedi''.\n\nOther Cherokee words contain character pairs that entail overlapping transliteration sequences. Examples:\n* \u13c0\u13be transliterates as ''nahna'', yet so does \u13be\u13bf. The former is ''nah-na'', the latter is ''na-hna''.\nIf the Latin script is parsed from left to right, longest match first, then without special provisions, the back conversion would be wrong for the latter. There are several similar examples involving these character combinations: ''naha nahe nahi naho nahu nahv''.\n\nA further problem encountered in transliterating Cherokee is that there are some pairs of different Cherokee words that transliterate to the same word in the Latin script. Here are some examples:\n* \u13a0\u13cd\u13a1\u13c3 and \u13a0\u13ce\u13c3 both transliterate to ''aseno''\n* \u13a8\u13cd\u13a5\u13a2 and \u13a8\u13d2\u13a2 both transliterate to ''gesvi''\nWithout special provision, a round trip conversion may change \u13a0\u13cd\u13a1\u13c3 to \u13a0\u13ce\u13c3 and change \u13a8\u13cd\u13a5\u13a2 to \u13a8\u13d2\u13a2.\n\n==Character orders==\n[[File:Cherokee syllabary original order.png|thumb|Original Cherokee syllabary order, with the now obsolete letter \u13f5 in red]]\n* The usual alphabetical order for Cherokee runs across the rows of the syllabary chart from left to right, top to bottom\u2014this is the one used in the Unicode block: \u13a0 (a), \u13a1 (e), \u13a2 (i), \u13a3 (o), \u13a4 (u), \u13a5 (v), \u13a6 (ga), \u13a7 (ka), \u13a8 (ge), \u13a9 (gi), \u13aa (go), \u13ab (gu), \u13ac (gv), \u13ad (ha), \u13ae (he), \u13af (hi), \u13b0 (ho), \u13b1 (hu), \u13b2 (hv), \u13b3 (la), \u13b4 (le), \u13b5 (li), \u13b6 (lo), \u13b7 (lu), \u13b8 (lv), \u13b9 (ma), \u13ba (me), \u13bb (mi), \u13bc (mo), \u13bd (mu), \u13be (na), \u13bf (hna), \u13c0 (nah), \u13c1 (ne), \u13c2 (ni), \u13c3 (no), \u13c4 (nu), \u13c5 (nv), \u13c6 (qua), \u13c7 (que), \u13c8 (qui), \u13c9 (quo), \u13ca (quu), \u13cb (quv), \u13cc (sa), \u13cd (s), \u13ce (se), \u13cf (si), \u13d0 (so), \u13d1 (su), \u13d2 (sv), \u13d3 (da), \u13d4 (ta), \u13d5 (de), \u13d6 (te), \u13d7 (di), \u13d8 (ti), \u13d9 (do), \u13da (du), \u13db (dv), \u13dc (dla), \u13dd (tla), \u13de (tle), \u13df (tli), \u13e0 (tlo), \u13e1 (tlu), \u13e2 (tlv), \u13e3 (tsa), \u13e4 (tse), \u13e5 (tsi), \u13e6 (tso), \u13e7 (tsu), \u13e8 (tsv), \u13e9 (wa), \u13ea (we), \u13eb (wi), \u13ec (wo), \u13ed (wu), \u13ee (wv), \u13ef (ya), \u13f0 (ye), \u13f1 (yi), \u13f2 (yo), \u13f3 (yu), \u13f4 (yv).\n\n* Cherokee has also been alphabetized based on the six columns of the syllabary chart from top to bottom, left to right: \u13a0 (a), \u13a6 (ga), \u13a7 (ka), \u13ad (ha), \u13b3 (la), \u13b9 (ma), \u13be (na), \u13bf (hna), \u13c0 (nah), \u13c6 (qua), \u13cd (s), \u13cc (sa), \u13d3 (da), \u13d4 (ta), \u13dc (dla), \u13dd (tla), \u13e3 (tsa), \u13e9 (wa), \u13ef (ya), \u13a1 (e), \u13a8 (ge), \u13ae (he), \u13b4 (le), \u13ba (me), \u13c1 (ne), \u13c7 (que), \u13ce (se), \u13d5 (de), \u13d6 (te), \u13de (tle), \u13e4 (tse), \u13ea (we), \u13f0 (ye), \u13a2 (i), \u13a9 (gi), \u13af (hi), \u13b5 (li), \u13bb (mi), \u13c2 (ni), \u13c8 (qui), \u13cf (si), \u13d7 (di), \u13d8 (ti), \u13df (tli), \u13e5 (tsi), \u13eb (wi), \u13f1 (yi), \u13a3 (o), \u13aa (go), \u13b0 (ho), \u13b6 (lo), \u13bc (mo), \u13c3 (no), \u13c9 (quo), \u13d0 (so), \u13d9 (do), \u13e0 (tlo), \u13e6 (tso), \u13ec (wo), \u13f2 (yo), \u13a4 (u), \u13ab (gu), \u13b1 (hu), \u13b7 (lu), \u13bd (mu), \u13c4 (nu), \u13ca (quu), \u13d1 (su), \u13da (du), \u13e1 (tlu), \u13e7 (tsu), \u13ed (wu), \u13f3 (yu), \u13a5 (v), \u13ac (gv), \u13b2 (hv), \u13b8 (lv), \u13c5 (nv), \u13cb (quv), \u13d2 (sv), \u13db (dv), \u13e2 (tlv), \u13e8 (tsv), \u13ee (wv), \u13f4 (yv).\n\n* Sequoyah used a completely different alphabetical order: \u13a1 (e), \u13a0 (a), \u13b3 (la), \u13e5 (tsi), \u13c0 (nah), \u13ed (wu), \u13ea (we), \u13b5 (li), \u13c1 (ne), \u13bc (mo), \u13a9 (gi), \u13f1 (yi), \u13cf (si), \u13e2 (tlv), \u13a3 (o), \u13b7 (lu), \u13b4 (le), \u13ad (ha), \u13ec (wo), \u13e0 (tlo), \u13d4 (ta), \u13f4 (yv), \u13b8 (lv), \u13af (hi), \u13cd (s), \u13f2 (yo), \u13b1 (hu), \u13aa (go), \u13e7 (tsu), \u13bd (mu), \u13ce (se), \u13d0 (so), \u13df (tli), \u13c8 (qui), \u13c7 (que), \u13cc (sa), \u13c6 (qua), \u13c3 (no), \u13a7 (ka), \u13e8 (tsv), \u13d2 (sv), \u13c2 (ni), \u13a6 (ga), \u13d9 (do), \u13a8 (ge), \u13d3 (da), \u13ac (gv), \u13eb (wi), \u13a2 (i), \u13a4 (u), \u13f0 (ye), \u13b2 (hv), \u13db (dv), \u13ab (gu), \u13e6 (tso), \u13c9 (quo), \u13c4 (nu), \u13be (na), \u13b6 (lo), \u13f3 (yu), \u13e4 (tse), \u13d7 (di), \u13ee (wv), \u13da(du), \u13d5 (de), \u13e3 (tsa), \u13a5 (v), \u13c5 (nv), \u13d6 (te), \u13b9 (ma), \u13d1 (su), \u13e1 (tlu), \u13ae (he), \u13b0 (ho), \u13bb (mi), \u13dd (tla), \u13ef (ya), \u13e9 (wa), \u13d8 (ti), \u13de (tle), \u13bf (hna), \u13ca (quu), \u13dc (dla), \u13ba (me), \u13cb (quv).\n* And the usual order goes: \u13ef, \u13a3, \u13af, \u13b9, \u13c0, \u13e4, \u13da, \u13a4, \u13a0, \u13c8, \u13a2, \u13ea, \u13be, \u13e9, \u13d8, \u13dd, \u13ac, \u13ba, \u13cd, \u13a1, \u13df, \u13a8, \u13a5, \u13d4, \u13ee, \u13b0, \u13ed, \u13bc, \u13a7, \u13d0, \u13d6, \u13c4, \u13ad, \u13c6, \u13eb, \u13dc, \u13cb, \u13e7, \u13f3, \u13e8, \u13d7, \u13b2, \u13ca, \u13c7, \u13b3, \u13c5, \u13ae, \u13b1, \u13e3, \u13e9, \u13e6, \u13f1, \u13c2, \u13be, \u13bf, \u13f2, \u13de, \u13e1, \u13db, \u13e0,\n\n==Numerals==\nCherokee uses [[Arabic numerals]] (0\u20139).

After attempting to create a character for each word, Sequoyah realized this would be too difficult and eventually created characters to represent syllables. He worked on the syllabary for twelve years before completion and dropped or modified most of the characters he originally created.\n\nAfter the syllabary was completed in the early 1820s, it achieved almost instantaneous popularity and spread rapidly throughout Cherokee society.{{Sfn | Walker | Sarbaugh | 1993 | p = 70\u201372}} By 1825, the majority of Cherokees could read and write in their newly developed orthography.{{Sfn | McLaughlin | 1986 | p = 353}}\n\nSome of Sequoyah's most learned contemporaries immediately understood that the syllabary was a great invention. For example, when [[Albert Gallatin]], a politician and trained linguist, saw a copy of Sequoyah's syllabary, he believed it was superior to the English alphabet.{{clarify|reason=Superior to English orthography or superior to the Latin alphabet??|date=May 2019}} He recognized that even though the Cherokee student must learn 85 characters instead of 26 for English, the Cherokee could read immediately after learning all the symbols. The Cherokee student could accomplish in a few weeks what students of English writing might require two years to achieve.<ref>Langguth, A. J. (2010).

The Vai syllabary emerged about 1832/33. The link appears to have been Cherokee who emigrated to Liberia after the invention of the Cherokee syllabary (which in its early years spread rapidly among the Cherokee) but before the inventions of the Vai syllabary. One such man, Austin Curtis, married into a prominent [[Vai people|Vai]] family and became an important Vai chief himself. It is perhaps not coincidence that the \"inscription on a house\" that drew the world's attention to the existence of the Vai script was in fact on the home of Curtis, a Cherokee.{{Sfn | Tuchscherer | 2002}}  There also appears to be a connection between an early form of written [[Bassa language|Bassa]] and the earlier Cherokee syllabary.\n\n==Classes==\n[[File:Cherokeeclass.png|thumb|right|Oklahoma [[Cherokee language]] immersion school student writing in the Cherokee syllabary.]]\nCherokee language classes typically begin with a transliteration of Cherokee into Roman letters, only later incorporating the syllabary.

The script may be derived from the [[Kawi script|Kawi]] and [[Pallava script]], ultimately derived from the [[Brahmi script]] of India, or from the hypothetical Proto-Sumatran script influenced by Pallava.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ulikozok.com/aksara-batak/sejarah-aksara-batak/|author=Uli Kozok|title=Sejarah Aksara Batak|accessdate=17 May 2014}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\nThe Batak magicians and priests or ''datu'' used the Batak script mainly for magical texts and divinatory purposes. It is unknown how many non-specialists were literate in the Batak script, but judging from the widespread tradition of writing love laments, especially among the Karo, Simalungun, and Angkola-Mandailing Batak, it is likely that a considerable part of the non-specialist population was able to read and write the Batak script. After the arrival of Europeans in the Batak lands, first German missionaries and, from 1878 onwards, the Dutch, the Batak script was, alongside the Roman script,  taught in the schools, and teaching and religious materials were printed in the Batak script. Soon after the first World War the missionaries decided to discontinue printing books in the Batak script.<ref>Kozok 2009:168.</ref> The script soon fell out of use and is now only used for ornamental purposes.\n\n==Origin==\n\nThe Batak script was probably derived from [[Pallava script|Pallava]] and [[Old Kawi]] scripts, which ultimately were derived from the [[Brahmi script]], the root of almost all the Indic and Southeast Asian scripts.\n\n==Structure==\n\nBatak is written from left to right and top to bottom. Like all Brahmi-based scripts, each consonant has an inherent vowel of {{IPA|/a/}}, unless there is a diacritic (in Toba Batak called ''pangolat'') to indicate the lack of a vowel. Other vowels, final ''[[Eng (letter)|\u014b]]'', and final velar fricative {{IPA|[x]}} are indicated by [[diacritic]]s, which appear above, below, or after the letter. For example, ''ba'' is written '''ba''' (one letter); ''bi'' is written '''ba.i''' (''i'' follows the consonant); ''bang'' is written '''ba<sup>\u014b</sup>''' (''\u014b'' is above the consonant); and ''bing'' is '''ba<sup>\u014b</sup>.i'''. Final consonants are written with the ''pangolat'' (here represented by \"#\"): ''bam'' is '''ba.ma.#'''. However, ''bim'' is written '''ba.ma.i.#''': the first diacritic belongs to the first consonant, and the second belongs to the second consonant, but both are written at the end of the entire syllable.  Unlike most Brahmi-based scripts, Batak does not form consonant conjuncts.\n\n==Basic characters==\n\nThe basic characters are called ''surat''. Each consonant has an inherent vowel of {{IPA|/a/}}. The script varies by region and language. The major variants are between\n[[Batak Karo language|Karo]],\n[[Mandailing language|Mandailing]],\n[[Pakpak language|Pakpak]]/Dairi,\n[[Simalungun language|Simalungun]]/Timur, and\n[[Toba Batak language|Toba]]:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%;

Ng and H===\nThe diacritics for Ng ([[File:Batak sign Ng.svg|30px|link=|alt=-Ng]]) and H ([[File:Batak sign H.svg|30px|link=|alt=-H]]) are usually written above spacing vowel diacritics instead of above the base character.<br>\nExamples: [[File:Batak syllable ping.svg|baseline|30px|link=|alt=Ping]] ping, [[File:Batak syllable pong.svg|baseline|30px|link=|alt=Pong]] pong, [[File:Batak syllable peh.svg|baseline|30px|link=|alt=Peh]] peh, and [[File:Batak syllable pih.svg|baseline|30px|link=|alt=Pih]] pih.\n\n===Diacritic reordering for closed syllables===\n\nVowel diacritics are reordered for closed syllables (that is, syllables where the final consonant has no vowel).\nConsonants with no vowel are marked by the Batak ''pangolat'' or ''panongonan'' diacritic, depending on the language.\nWhen they are used for a closed syllable (like \"tip\"), both the vowel diacritic and the pangolat/panongonan are written at the end of the syllable.\n\nExamples of closed syllables using ''pangolat'':\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" summary=\"reordering\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | ta\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"border-left:#aaaaaa hidden;border-right:#aaaaaa hidden;\" | &nbsp;+&nbsp;\n!

The script may be derived from the [[Kawi script|Kawi]] and [[Pallava script]], ultimately derived from the [[Brahmi script]] of India, or from the hypothetical Proto-Sumatran script influenced by Pallava.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ulikozok.com/aksara-batak/sejarah-aksara-batak/|author=Uli Kozok|title=Sejarah Aksara Batak|accessdate=17 May 2014}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\nThe Batak magicians and priests or ''datu'' used the Batak script mainly for magical texts and divinatory purposes. It is unknown how many non-specialists were literate in the Batak script, but judging from the widespread tradition of writing love laments, especially among the Karo, Simalungun, and Angkola-Mandailing Batak, it is likely that a considerable part of the non-specialist population was able to read and write the Batak script. After the arrival of Europeans in the Batak lands, first German missionaries and, from 1878 onwards, the Dutch, the Batak script was, alongside the Roman script,  taught in the schools, and teaching and religious materials were printed in the Batak script. Soon after the first World War the missionaries decided to discontinue printing books in the Batak script.<ref>Kozok 2009:168.</ref> The script soon fell out of use and is now only used for ornamental purposes.\n\n==Origin==\n\nThe Batak script was probably derived from [[Pallava script|Pallava]] and [[Old Kawi]] scripts, which ultimately were derived from the [[Brahmi script]], the root of almost all the Indic and Southeast Asian scripts.\n\n==Structure==\n\nBatak is written from left to right and top to bottom. Like all Brahmi-based scripts, each consonant has an inherent vowel of {{IPA|/a/}}, unless there is a diacritic (in Toba Batak called ''pangolat'') to indicate the lack of a vowel. Other vowels, final ''[[Eng (letter)|\u014b]]'', and final velar fricative {{IPA|[x]}} are indicated by [[diacritic]]s, which appear above, below, or after the letter. For example, ''ba'' is written '''ba''' (one letter); ''bi'' is written '''ba.i''' (''i'' follows the consonant); ''bang'' is written '''ba<sup>\u014b</sup>''' (''\u014b'' is above the consonant); and ''bing'' is '''ba<sup>\u014b</sup>.i'''. Final consonants are written with the ''pangolat'' (here represented by \"#\"): ''bam'' is '''ba.ma.#'''. However, ''bim'' is written '''ba.ma.i.#''': the first diacritic belongs to the first consonant, and the second belongs to the second consonant, but both are written at the end of the entire syllable.  Unlike most Brahmi-based scripts, Batak does not form consonant conjuncts.\n\n==Basic characters==\n\nThe basic characters are called ''surat''. Each consonant has an inherent vowel of {{IPA|/a/}}. The script varies by region and language. The major variants are between\n[[Batak Karo language|Karo]],\n[[Mandailing language|Mandailing]],\n[[Pakpak language|Pakpak]]/Dairi,\n[[Simalungun language|Simalungun]]/Timur, and\n[[Toba Batak language|Toba]]:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%;

Ng and H===\nThe diacritics for Ng ([[File:Batak sign Ng.svg|30px|link=|alt=-Ng]]) and H ([[File:Batak sign H.svg|30px|link=|alt=-H]]) are usually written above spacing vowel diacritics instead of above the base character.<br>\nExamples: [[File:Batak syllable ping.svg|baseline|30px|link=|alt=Ping]] ping, [[File:Batak syllable pong.svg|baseline|30px|link=|alt=Pong]] pong, [[File:Batak syllable peh.svg|baseline|30px|link=|alt=Peh]] peh, and [[File:Batak syllable pih.svg|baseline|30px|link=|alt=Pih]] pih.\n\n===Diacritic reordering for closed syllables===\n\nVowel diacritics are reordered for closed syllables (that is, syllables where the final consonant has no vowel).\nConsonants with no vowel are marked by the Batak ''pangolat'' or ''panongonan'' diacritic, depending on the language.\nWhen they are used for a closed syllable (like \"tip\"), both the vowel diacritic and the pangolat/panongonan are written at the end of the syllable.\n\nExamples of closed syllables using ''pangolat'':\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" summary=\"reordering\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | ta\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"border-left:#aaaaaa hidden;border-right:#aaaaaa hidden;\" | &nbsp;+&nbsp;\n!
