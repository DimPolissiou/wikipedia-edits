Henry and C.W. Brown in 1935 is the oldest [[Cenozoic]] sedimentary unit in Saudi Arabia, from the [[Paleocene]] to the early [[Eocene]]. It is visible in the walls of Wadi al Batin and overlies the dolomite and limestone of the Aruma Formation. The formation spans 1200 kilometers from Wadi Jabaliyah to the Iraq-Saudi Arabia border. [[Karst]] commonly forms in the uplands along with river channels. Northwest of Al Batin, the rock has very poor internal drainage.

The night was a windy one and the flames rapidly spread along the full length of the Circus. The fire expanded through an area of narrow, twisting streets and closely located apartment blocks. In this lower area of ancient Rome there were no large buildings such as temples, or open areas of ground, to impede the conflagration. It then spread along the Palatine and Caelian slopes. The population fled first to areas unaffected by the fire and then to the open fields and rural roads outside the city. Looters and arsonists were reported to have spread the flames by throwing torches or, acting in groups, hindering measures being made to halt or slow the progress of the flames. The fire stopped after six days of continuous burning.

After the Great Fire of Rome occurred in 64 AD, it was rumored that Nero ordered the fire to clear space for a new palace.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Egypt, Greece, and Rome : civilizations of the ancient Mediterranean|last=Freeman, Charles|isbn=978-0199651917|edition= Third|location=Oxford|oclc=868077503|year= 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Tacitus ===\nPublius Cornelius Tacitus was a senator and historian of the Roman Empire. His exact birth date is unknown, but most sources place it in either 56 or 57 AD. His two main works, the ''[[Annals (Tacitus)|Annals]]'' and the ''[[Histories (Tacitus)|Histories]]'', covered the history of the empire between 14 AD and 96 AD. However, much of the work has been lost, including the books covering events after 70 AD. He was only 8 years old at the time of the fire, but he was able to use public records and reports to write an accurate account.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Tacitus-Roman-historian|title=Tacitus {{!}} Roman historian|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2019-04-13}}</ref>\n\n==Outbreak and progress of fire==\nAccording to Tacitus, the fire began in shops where flammable goods were stored, in the region of the Circus neighboring the [[Caelian Hill|Caelian]] and [[Palatine Hill|Palatine]] Hills of Rome. The night was a windy one and the flames rapidly spread along the full length of the Circus. The fire expanded through an area of narrow, twisting streets and closely located apartment blocks. In this lower area of ancient Rome there were no large buildings such as temples, or open areas of ground, to impede the conflagration. It then spread along the Palatine and Caelian slopes. The population fled first to areas unaffected by the fire and then to the open fields and rural roads outside the city. Looters and arsonists were reported to have spread the flames by throwing torches or, acting in groups, hindering measures being made to halt or slow the progress of the flames. The fire stopped after six days of continuous burning. However, it soon reignited and burned for another three days.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Annals|last=Tacitus|first=Publius|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\n[[File:Siemiradski Fackeln.jpg|thumb|''[[Nero's Torches]]'' by [[Henryk Siemiradzki]]. According to Tacitus, [[Nero]] targeted [[Christians]] as those responsible for the fire.]]\nAccording to Tacitus, Nero was away from Rome, in [[Antium]], when the fire broke out. Nero returned to the city and took measures to bring in food supplies and open gardens and public buildings to accommodate refugees.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.historytoday.com/archive/months-past/great-fire-rome|title=The Great Fire of Rome {{!}} History Today|website=www.historytoday.com|access-date=2019-11-29}}</ref> Of Rome's 14 districts, 3 were completely devastated, 7 more were reduced to a few scorched and mangled ruins and only 4 completely escaped damage.

It is known only from [[fossil]] teeth, which were discovered during expeditions to the [[Tendaguru Formation]] by the [[Natural History Museum, Berlin|Natural History Museum]] of Berlin, from 1909 to 1912. Eight teeth collected during the expedition were originally attributed to the [[Dubious name|dubious]] dinosaur genus ''[[Labrosaurus]]'', and later to ''[[Ceratosaurus]]'', both known from the American [[Morrison Formation]]. Subsequent studies resulted in them being identified as those of a [[Spinosauridae|spinosaurid]] dinosaur. In [[2012 in paleontology|2012]], French palaeontologist [[Eric Buffetaut]] used two of said teeth to name the new genus and [[species]] '''''Ostafrikasaurus crassiserratus''''', identifying it as an early member of the group. Its generic name comes from the German word for \"German East Africa\", the former name of the colony in which the fossils were found, while the specific name comes from the Latin words for \"thick\" and \"serrated\", in reference to the [[Morphology (biology)|form]] of the animal's teeth. Some palaeontologists have questioned the validity of ''Ostafrikasaurus'', given the difficulties with identifying isolated teeth from theropod dinosaurs. \n\n''Ostafrikasaurus'' has been estimated at possibly {{convert|8.4|m|ft}} long and {{convert|1.15|t|lb}} in weight. The [[holotype]] tooth is {{Convert|46|mm|}} long, has a curved front edge, and is somewhat flattened from side to side. It shows [[Serration|serrations]] that\u2014for spinosaur standards\u2014are unusually large, more so than in any other known [[taxon]]. Both the front and back cutting edges are serrated, with two to four [[Denticle (tooth feature)|denticles]] per millimetre (0.04 in). The tooth also has ridges along part of its length on both sides, and the outermost [[Tooth enamel|enamel]] layer is wrinkled in the regions between and without ridges. ''Ostafrikasaurus'''s well-developed serrations, compared to the smaller, finer ones of later relatives like ''[[Baryonyx]]'', and the lack of serrations on taxa like ''[[Spinosaurus]]'', led Buffetaut to hypothesize that spinosaurid teeth lost their serrations as they became more specialised for an aquatic diet. ''Ostafrikasaurus'' lived in a [[Subtropics|subtropical]] to [[Tropics|tropical]] environment alongside many other dinosaurs, as well as [[Pterosaur|pterosaurs]], [[Crocodyliformes|crocodyliforms]], fish, small mammals, and numerous [[Invertebrate|invertebrates]].\n\n== History of research ==\n[[File:Janensch.jpg|left|thumb|[[Werner Janensch]] during the [[Tendaguru Formation|Tendaguru]] expedition, 1910]]\n\nDuring the time of the [[German colonial empire]], the [[Museum fur Naturkunde|Museum f\u00fcr Naturkunde]] (Natural History Museum) of Berlin arranged an expedition in [[German East Africa]] (now [[Tanzania]]) that took place from 1909 to 1912, now considered by scientists as one of the largest expeditions in palaeontological history.

''stechowi'' as lacking diagnostic [[Character (biology)|characters]] (unique derived traits), concurring that the taxon is a ''[[nomen dubium]]'' (dubious name). Rauhut noted that they can however still be differentiated from other theropod teeth found in the Tendaguru Formation, based on their marginally flattened [[Crown (tooth)|crowns]], slight recurvature, and broad ridges on the [[Glossary of dentistry#lingual|lingual]] flank (which faced the inside of the mouth). He did not include MB R 1084 in this analysis, considering it to represent another form than the other eight teeth, with uncertain [[Taxonomic rank|taxonomic]] placement.<ref name=\"Veterupristisaurus\" /> Rauhut recognised ''L. sulcatus'' as a ''nomen dubium'', noting that the tooth referred to it was shown only in a single illustration and not properly described in text. In addition, no teeth from ''Labrosaurus'' were recovered with its original remains. And an additional species named by Marsh, ''Labrosaurus ferox'' (now considered synonymous with ''Allosaurus fragillis<ref name=\"HMC04\">{{cite book|last=Holtz|first=Thomas R., Jr.|title=The Dinosauria|author2=Molnar, Ralph E.|author3=Currie, Philip J.|publisher=University of California Press|year=2004|isbn=978-0-520-24209-8|editor=Weishampel David B.|edition=2nd|location=Berkeley|pages=71\u2013110|chapter=Basal Tetanurae|authorlink=Thomas R. Holtz, Jr.|editor2=Dodson, Peter|editor3=Osm\u00f3lska, Halszka}}</ref>''), was based on a dentary that has teeth of different [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]] to those of ''L. sulcatus''. Thus, Rauhut considered Janensch's assignment of the Tendaguru teeth to ''Labrosaurus'' as unfounded. He provisionally referred all of them but MB R 1084 to ''Ceratosaurus'' (under the new [[Binomial nomenclature|binomial]] ''Ceratosaurus''? ''stechowi''), on the basis of anatomical similarities with teeth from that genus. According Rauhut's observations, the different features between Janensch's type b, c, e, and d teeth did not represent distinct taxa, but rather variation along the tooth row in the animal's jaws. Rauhut also attributed another tooth (MB R 1093) described by Janensch, yet not referred by to ''L.''? ''stechowi'', to the same taxon.<ref name=\"Veterupristisaurus\" /> \n\nRauhut listed some differences between Janensch's type a (MB R 1084) and the other teeth originally referred to ''L''.? ''stechowi'': MB R 1084 has more lingual ridges (up to eleven) and three ridges and grooves on the [[Glossary of dentistry#labial|labial]] side, which faced the outside of the mouth. Moreover, some of MB R 1084's ridges are confined to the base of the crown, joined by longer ridges extending throughout almost the whole length of the crown, with a {{Convert|5|mm||abbr=on}} high region at the tip of the tooth lacking any ornamentation. Additionally, ridges are present over almost the entire front three-fifths of the crown, whereas the rear two-fifths are smooth. Towards the front of the tooth, the ridged part is separated from the [[Glossary of dentistry#carina|carina]] (cutting edge) by an area that is slightly concave front to back. The only similarities between MB R 1084 and the Middle Dinosaur Member teeth lie in their general shape and [[serration]] density, as all teeth have 10 [[Denticle (tooth feature)|denticles]] per {{Convert|5|mm||abbr=}} on the rear carina and 13 denticles per {{Convert|5|mm||abbr=}} on the front carina. Finally, Rauhut suggested it possible that this tooth represents the same taxon as the other teeth, or a closely related taxon.<ref name=\"Veterupristisaurus\">{{cite journal|last=Rauhut|first=Oliver W. M.|year=2011|title=Theropod dinosaurs from the Late Jurassic of Tendaguru (Tanzania)|url=|journal=Special Papers in Palaeontology|volume=86|issue=|pages=195\u2013239|doi=10.1111/j.1475-4983.2011.01084.x|doi-broken-date=2020-04-14|via=|url=https://www.palass.org/publications/special-papers-palaeontology/archive/86/article_pp195-239}}</ref>\n\nIn a [[2012 in paleontology|2012]] paper, with MB R 1084 as the basis, or [[holotype specimen]], Buffetaut named the new [[genus]] and [[species]] ''Ostafrikasaurus crassiserratus'', describing it as an early spinosaurid theropod. The [[Name of a biological genus|generic name]] is derived from the German name of the colony in which the fossils were found, ''Deutsch-Ostafrika,'' meaning \"German East Africa\", combined with the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] \u03c3\u03b1\u1fe6\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 (''{{lang|grc-Latn|sauros}}''), meaning \"lizard\" or \"reptile\". The [[Specific name (zoology)|specific name]] is derived from the [[Latin]] ''{{lang|la|crassus}},'' meaning \"thick\"; and ''{{lang|la|serratus}},'' meaning \"serrated\", in reference to the large serrations of its teeth. Due to similarities with MB R 1084, Buffetaut assigned MB R 1091 from the Middle Dinosaur Member to the same species. Both teeth have a curved front carina, no side to side curvature, and a comparable shape in cross section. Their primary differences include MB R 1091 having five lengthwise ridges on its lingual side compared to MB R 1084's ten, the ridges on the former being less extensive. MB R 1091 also appears to have had less wrinkled [[tooth enamel]]. Buffetaut notes that though such differences could be explained by [[individual variation]] within the taxon, both teeth originated from different members of the Tendaguru Formation, thus making the referral tentative.<ref name=\"Ostafrikasaurus2\" />\n\nBuffetaut elaborated on the differences between the teeth of ''Ostafrikasaurus crassiserratus'' and Janensch's ''Labrosaurus''? ''stechowi'' morphotypes. Morphotype b (MB R 1083 and 1087) teeth had both front to back and side to side curvature, and a D-shaped cross section.

Both carinae are serrated, with rounded denticles perpendicular to the edge of the tooth. The serrations have no inderdenticle sulci, or grooves, in between them. They line the front carina from the base to its tip, and probably also did on the back carina, whose base has been largely eroded. Towards the tip of the tooth, these serrations are very worn down (especially on the front carina). On the front carina, there are two [[Denticle (tooth feature)|denticles]] per millimetre (0.04 in) near the tip of the tooth, and three to four per millimetre (0.04 in) as the denticles shrink towards the base of the crown.

In regards to dental traits, baryonychines are characterized by slightly curved, finely-serrated teeth with more oval cross sections, while spinosaurine teeth are usually observed to be straight, having highly reduced or completely absent serrations, more circular cross sections, and prominent lengthwise ridges on their enamel.<ref name=\"hone2017\" />''<ref name=\"EBetal082\">{{cite journal|last=Buffetaut|first=E.|author2=Suteethorn, V.|author3=Tong, H.|author4=Amiot, R.|year=2008|title=An Early Cretaceous spinosaur theropod from southern China|journal=Geological Magazine|volume=145|issue=5|pages=745\u2013748|bibcode=2008GeoM..145..745B|doi=10.1017/S0016756808005360}}</ref>'' In 2007, Fowler interpreted the ''L''.?

In type d, only one side of the tooth has ridges, which can also be observed in the teeth of ''Baryonyx'''s holotype specimen. Furthermore, Buffetaut added that the only resemblance the other types (b, c, and e) share with Janensch's type a and d is ridges covering part of the tooth crown, while in all other aspects, such as their shape and cross section, they are substantially different. In Buffetaut's analysis, types b, c, and e are probably [[Ceratosauridae|ceratosaurid]] in origin, while type a likely represents an early spinosaurid, different from [[Early Cretaceous]] baryonychines.<ref name=\":0\" />[[File:Spinosaurus_sp_Marocco_Cenom.JPG|thumb|left|Tooth of the related genus ''[[Spinosaurus]]'', Museo di Storia Naturale A. Stoppani, [[Lombardy]]]]\n\nRauhut expressed doubt on this interpretation in 2011, stating that MB R 1084 has more similarities than differences with ''Ceratosaurus''? ''stechowi'' teeth, like the round cross section, only marginal curvature of the crown, a more convex lingual than labial side, and close size and shape of the denticles. Thus, according to his analysis, only the ridge count and distribution were left as unique to MB R 1084. Rauhut noted that though baryonychines also have ridges on either side of their teeth, they are usually most developed at the rear of the tooth, whereas MB R 1084 lacks ridges on that side. He also asserts that the wrinkling Buffetaut observed in MB R 1084's enamel is very faint and largely restricted to the lingual side, compared to the more conspicuously grainy texture of ''Baryonyx'' teeth. According to Rauhut, though MB R 1084 is potentially spinosaurid in origin, it shares only generic resemblance to baryonychine teeth, and instead probably represents a close relative of ''Ceratosaurus''? ''stechowi''.<ref name=\"Veterupristisaurus\" /> In Buffetaut's 2012 naming of ''Ostafrikasaurus'', he placed it in the Spinosauridae, asserting instead that the tooth is very much akin to those of baryonychines including ''Baryonyx''. Among their shared dental features he included the slight sideways-flattening of the crown, fine enamel wrinkles, and ridges on both sides that do not reach the tooth tip, and are stronger and more numerous on the lingual than labial face.

This led him to hypothesize in 2008 that spinosaurid dental evolution was primarily characterized by the shrinking and eventual loss of serrations. This pattern would start with the large serrations of primitive Jurassic taxa (MB R 1084), evolving into the fine and reduced serrations of Early Cretaceous baryonychines (like ''[[Suchomimus]]'' and ''Baryonyx''), and conclude with the heavily diminished (''[[Siamosaurus]]'') or completely absent (''[[Spinosaurus]]'') serrations of spinosaurines.<ref name=\":0\" />''<ref name=\"EBetal082\" />''<ref name=\"Ostafrikasaurus\" /> \n\nIn 2012, Buffetaut added that due to the presence of such a [[Basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] spinosaurid in Africa, spinosaurids may have been widespread early in their evolutionary history.

It is known only from [[fossil]] teeth, which were discovered during expeditions to the [[Tendaguru Formation]] by the [[Natural History Museum, Berlin|Natural History Museum]] of Berlin, from 1909 to 1912. Eight teeth collected during the expedition were originally attributed to the [[Dubious name|dubious]] dinosaur genus ''[[Labrosaurus]]'', and later to ''[[Ceratosaurus]]'', both known from the American [[Morrison Formation]]. Subsequent studies resulted in them being identified as those of a [[Spinosauridae|spinosaurid]] dinosaur. In [[2012 in paleontology|2012]], French palaeontologist [[Eric Buffetaut]] used two of said teeth to name the new genus and [[species]] '''''Ostafrikasaurus crassiserratus''''', identifying it as an early member of the group. Its generic name comes from the German word for \"German East Africa\", the former name of the colony in which the fossils were found, while the specific name comes from the Latin words for \"thick\" and \"serrated\", in reference to the [[Morphology (biology)|form]] of the animal's teeth. Some palaeontologists have questioned the validity of ''Ostafrikasaurus'', given the difficulties with identifying isolated teeth from theropod dinosaurs. \n\n''Ostafrikasaurus'' has been estimated at possibly {{convert|8.4|m|ft}} long and {{convert|1.15|t|lb}} in weight. The [[holotype]] tooth is {{Convert|46|mm|}} long, has a curved front edge, and is somewhat flattened from side to side. It shows [[Serration|serrations]] that\u2014for spinosaur standards\u2014are unusually large, more so than in any other known [[taxon]]. Both the front and back cutting edges are serrated, with two to four [[Denticle (tooth feature)|denticles]] per millimetre (0.04 in). The tooth also has ridges along part of its length on both sides, and the outermost [[Tooth enamel|enamel]] layer is wrinkled in the regions between and without ridges. ''Ostafrikasaurus'''s well-developed serrations, compared to the smaller, finer ones of later relatives like ''[[Baryonyx]]'', and the lack of serrations on taxa like ''[[Spinosaurus]]'', led Buffetaut to hypothesize that spinosaurid teeth lost their serrations as they became more specialised for an aquatic diet. ''Ostafrikasaurus'' lived in a [[Subtropics|subtropical]] to [[Tropics|tropical]] environment alongside many other dinosaurs, as well as [[Pterosaur|pterosaurs]], [[Crocodyliformes|crocodyliforms]], fish, small mammals, and numerous [[Invertebrate|invertebrates]].\n\n== History of research ==\n[[File:Janensch.jpg|left|thumb|[[Werner Janensch]] during the [[Tendaguru Formation|Tendaguru]] expedition, 1910]]\n\nDuring the time of the [[German colonial empire]], the [[Museum fur Naturkunde|Museum f\u00fcr Naturkunde]] (Natural History Museum) of Berlin arranged an expedition in [[German East Africa]] (now [[Tanzania]]) that took place from 1909 to 1912, now considered by scientists as one of the largest expeditions in palaeontological history.

''stechowi'' as lacking diagnostic [[Character (biology)|characters]] (unique derived traits), concurring that the taxon is a ''[[nomen dubium]]'' (dubious name). Rauhut noted that they can however still be differentiated from other theropod teeth found in the Tendaguru Formation, based on their marginally flattened [[Crown (tooth)|crowns]], slight recurvature, and broad ridges on the [[Glossary of dentistry#lingual|lingual]] flank (which faced the inside of the mouth).

In addition, no teeth from ''Labrosaurus'' were recovered with its original remains. And an additional species named by Marsh, ''Labrosaurus ferox'' (now considered synonymous with ''Allosaurus fragillis<ref name=\"HMC04\">{{cite book|last=Holtz|first=Thomas R., Jr.|title=The Dinosauria|author2=Molnar, Ralph E.|author3=Currie, Philip J.|publisher=University of California Press|year=2004|isbn=978-0-520-24209-8|editor=Weishampel David B.|edition=2nd|location=Berkeley|pages=71\u2013110|chapter=Basal Tetanurae|authorlink=Thomas R. Holtz, Jr.|editor2=Dodson, Peter|editor3=Osm\u00f3lska, Halszka}}</ref>''), was based on a dentary that has teeth of different [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]] to those of ''L. sulcatus''. Thus, Rauhut considered Janensch's assignment of the Tendaguru teeth to ''Labrosaurus'' as unfounded. He provisionally referred all of them but MB R 1084 to ''Ceratosaurus'' (under the new [[Binomial nomenclature|binomial]] ''Ceratosaurus''? ''stechowi''), on the basis of anatomical similarities with teeth from that genus. According Rauhut's observations, the different features between Janensch's type b, c, e, and d teeth did not represent distinct taxa, but rather variation along the tooth row in the animal's jaws. Rauhut also attributed another tooth (MB R 1093) described by Janensch, yet not referred by to ''L.''? ''stechowi'', to the same taxon.<ref name=\"Veterupristisaurus\" /> \n\nRauhut listed some differences between Janensch's type a (MB R 1084) and the other teeth originally referred to ''L''.? ''stechowi'': MB R 1084 has more lingual ridges (up to eleven) and three ridges and grooves on the [[Glossary of dentistry#labial|labial]] side, which faced the outside of the mouth. Moreover, some of MB R 1084's ridges are confined to the base of the crown, joined by longer ridges extending throughout almost the whole length of the crown, with a {{Convert|5|mm||abbr=on}} high region at the tip of the tooth lacking any ornamentation. Additionally, ridges are present over almost the entire front three-fifths of the crown, whereas the rear two-fifths are smooth. Towards the front of the tooth, the ridged part is separated from the [[Glossary of dentistry#carina|carina]] (cutting edge) by an area that is slightly concave front to back. The only similarities between MB R 1084 and the Middle Dinosaur Member teeth lie in their general shape and [[serration]] density, as all teeth have 10 [[Denticle (tooth feature)|denticles]] per {{Convert|5|mm||abbr=}} on the rear carina and 13 denticles per {{Convert|5|mm||abbr=}} on the front carina. Finally, Rauhut suggested it possible that this tooth represents the same taxon as the other teeth, or a closely related taxon.<ref name=\"Veterupristisaurus\">{{cite journal|last=Rauhut|first=Oliver W.

The [[Name of a biological genus|generic name]] is derived from the German name of the colony in which the fossils were found, ''Deutsch-Ostafrika,'' meaning \"German East Africa\", combined with the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] \u03c3\u03b1\u1fe6\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 (''{{lang|grc-Latn|sauros}}''), meaning \"lizard\" or \"reptile\". The [[Specific name (zoology)|specific name]] is derived from the [[Latin]] ''{{lang|la|crassus}},'' meaning \"thick\"; and ''{{lang|la|serratus}},'' meaning \"serrated\", in reference to the large serrations of its teeth. Due to similarities with MB R 1084, Buffetaut assigned MB R 1091 from the Middle Dinosaur Member to the same species. Both teeth have a curved front carina, no side to side curvature, and a comparable shape in cross section. Their primary differences include MB R 1091 having five lengthwise ridges on its lingual side compared to MB R 1084's ten, the ridges on the former being less extensive. MB R 1091 also appears to have had less wrinkled [[tooth enamel]]. Buffetaut notes that though such differences could be explained by [[individual variation]] within the taxon, both teeth originated from different members of the Tendaguru Formation, thus making the referral tentative.<ref name=\"Ostafrikasaurus2\" />\n\nBuffetaut elaborated on the differences between the teeth of ''Ostafrikasaurus crassiserratus'' and Janensch's ''Labrosaurus''? ''stechowi'' morphotypes. Morphotype b (MB R 1083 and 1087) teeth had both front to back and side to side curvature, and a D-shaped cross section. Morphotype c (MB R 1090) was curved side to side but not front to back, was not flattened from side to side, had a rounded front with no carina, and bore five strong ridges on its lingual side, but none on its labial flank. Morphotype e (MB R 1092) resembled a typical theropod tooth. It is strongly flattened from side to side, curved from front to back, shows 3 denticles per millimetre (0.04 in), its front carina does not extend to the base of the crown, and there is no ornamentation aside from some weak furrowing of the crown, and two incipient ridges on the lingual side.<ref name=\"Ostafrikasaurus2\" />\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Ostafrikasaurus_crassiserratus_by_PaleoGeek.png|thumb|Hypothetical life [[paleoart|restoration]]|alt=]]\n\nIn 2016, Spanish palaeontologists Molina-P\u00e9rez and Larramendi estimated ''Ostafrikasaurus'' at about {{convert|8.4|m|ft}} long, {{convert|2.1|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall at the hips and weighing {{convert|1.15|t|lb}}.<ref name=\":20\">{{Cite book|last=Molina-Per\u00e9z & Larramendi|title=R\u00e9cords y curiosidades de los dinosaurios Ter\u00f3podos y otros dinosauromorfos|publisher=Larousse|year=2016|isbn=9780565094973|location=Barcelona, Spain|pages=275}}</ref> However, without more complete material, such as a skull or body fossil, the body size and weight of fragmentary spinosaur taxa, especially those known only from teeth, can not be reliably calculated.<ref name=\"hone2017\">{{Cite journal|last=Hone|first=David William Elliott|last2=Holtz|first2=Thomas Richard|date=June 2017|title=A century of spinosaurs \u2013 a review and revision of the Spinosauridae with comments on their ecology|journal=Acta Geologica Sinica \u2013 English Edition|language=en|volume=91|issue=3|pages=1120\u20131132|doi=10.1111/1755-6724.13328|issn=1000-9515}}</ref> \n\nThe holotype tooth is thick, somewhat flattened sideways, and {{Convert|46|mm|}} in length from top to bottom. Its tip has been rounded by [[erosion]] and the base is not fully preserved. The tooth crown has well-defined carinae (cutting edges), with the front carina being curved and the back carina almost straight. There is only mild side-to-side curvature. Both carinae are serrated, with rounded denticles perpendicular to the edge of the tooth. The serrations have no inderdenticle sulci, or grooves, in between them. They line the front carina from the base to its tip, and probably also did on the back carina, whose base has been largely eroded. Towards the tip of the tooth, these serrations are very worn down (especially on the front carina). On the front carina, there are two [[Denticle (tooth feature)|denticles]] per millimetre (0.04 in) near the tip of the tooth, and three to four per millimetre (0.04 in) as the denticles shrink towards the base of the crown. There are two denticles per millimetre (0.04 in) all along the back carina. The serrations are notably larger than in other known spinosaurids.<ref name=\"Ostafrikasaurus2\" /> \n\nThe enamel (outermost layer) of the tooth bears a series of ridges on its surface - 10 on the lingual side, and four fainter, less extensive ones on the labial side. The gaps between ridges are {{Convert|1|mm||abbr=on}} wide at most. None of the ridges on either side reach the tip of the crown. There is a {{Convert|3|mm||abbr=on}} wide region at the front of the tooth on both sides that lacks ridges; a similar area on the rear of the tooth side diminishes in width, from {{Convert|8 to 4|mm||abbr=on}} as it approaches the tip of the crown. On both sides of the tooth, between the ridges and ridge-less parts of the teeth, the enamel surface is finely wrinkled.<ref name=\"Ostafrikasaurus2\" />\n\n==Classification==\n[[File:Bryonyx.jpg|thumb|Reconstructed skeleton of ''[[Baryonyx]]'', a [[spinosaurid]] from the [[Early Cretaceous]] of western Europe]]\n\nSpinosaurids are typically separated into two [[subfamilies]]: Baryonychinae and Spinosaurinae. In regards to dental traits, baryonychines are characterized by slightly curved, finely-serrated teeth with more oval cross sections, while spinosaurine teeth are usually observed to be straight, having highly reduced or completely absent serrations, more circular cross sections, and prominent lengthwise ridges on their enamel.<ref name=\"hone2017\" />''<ref name=\"EBetal082\">{{cite journal|last=Buffetaut|first=E.|author2=Suteethorn, V.|author3=Tong, H.|author4=Amiot, R.|year=2008|title=An Early Cretaceous spinosaur theropod from southern China|journal=Geological Magazine|volume=145|issue=5|pages=745\u2013748|bibcode=2008GeoM..145..745B|doi=10.1017/S0016756808005360}}</ref>'' In 2007, Fowler interpreted the ''L''.? ''stechowi'' teeth as representing a possible primitive baryonychine or ancestral form to baryonychines, since they share features, such as tightly-packed [[Serration|serrations]], stout shape, marginally flattened tooth crowns, and ridges on their lingual face, typically associated with that [[clade]].<ref name=\"Fowler2007\" /> In 2008, Buffetaut separated only Janensch's morphotype a (MB R 1084) and d (MB R 1091) as having baryonychine characteristics, which in the former included its general form, somewhat flattened cross section, finely wrinkled enamel, ridges that do not reach the tip of the tooth, and having more ridges on the lingual than labial side. In type d, only one side of the tooth has ridges, which can also be observed in the teeth of ''Baryonyx'''s holotype specimen. Furthermore, Buffetaut added that the only resemblance the other types (b, c, and e) share with Janensch's type a and d is ridges covering part of the tooth crown, while in all other aspects, such as their shape and cross section, they are substantially different. In Buffetaut's analysis, types b, c, and e are probably [[Ceratosauridae|ceratosaurid]] in origin, while type a likely represents an early spinosaurid, different from [[Early Cretaceous]] baryonychines.<ref name=\":0\" />[[File:Spinosaurus_sp_Marocco_Cenom.JPG|thumb|left|Tooth of the related genus ''[[Spinosaurus]]'', Museo di Storia Naturale A. Stoppani, [[Lombardy]]]]\n\nRauhut expressed doubt on this interpretation in 2011, stating that MB R 1084 has more similarities than differences with ''Ceratosaurus''? ''stechowi'' teeth, like the round cross section, only marginal curvature of the crown, a more convex lingual than labial side, and close size and shape of the denticles. Thus, according to his analysis, only the ridge count and distribution were left as unique to MB R 1084. Rauhut noted that though baryonychines also have ridges on either side of their teeth, they are usually most developed at the rear of the tooth, whereas MB R 1084 lacks ridges on that side. He also asserts that the wrinkling Buffetaut observed in MB R 1084's enamel is very faint and largely restricted to the lingual side, compared to the more conspicuously grainy texture of ''Baryonyx'' teeth. According to Rauhut, though MB R 1084 is potentially spinosaurid in origin, it shares only generic resemblance to baryonychine teeth, and instead probably represents a close relative of ''Ceratosaurus''? ''stechowi''.<ref name=\"Veterupristisaurus\" /> In Buffetaut's 2012 naming of ''Ostafrikasaurus'', he placed it in the Spinosauridae, asserting instead that the tooth is very much akin to those of baryonychines including ''Baryonyx''. Among their shared dental features he included the slight sideways-flattening of the crown, fine enamel wrinkles, and ridges on both sides that do not reach the tooth tip, and are stronger and more numerous on the lingual than labial face.

He elaborated that spinosaurid teeth in particular share a unique morphology very divergent to those of other theropods.<ref name=\"Ostafrikasaurus\" />\n=== Evolution ===\n[[File:Spinosaurid tooth associated with Spinophorosaurus.png|thumb|Possible spinosaurid tooth dated to the [[Bathonian]] of [[Middle Jurassic]] Niger]]\n\nFowler noted in 2007 that a baryonychine identification for the teeth would suit [[biogeographical]] models proposed at the time for spinosaur evolution and distribution, which assumed an origin for the group in the southern [[supercontinent]] [[Gondwana]], with later spread and diversification in Europe. Furthermore, he put forward the possibility of spinosaurids having evolved from [[Ceratosauria|ceratosaur]] ancestors, given that baryonychine teeth have ridges on their crowns reminiscent to those seen on premaxillary and dentary teeth from ''Ceratosaurus''.<ref name=\"Fowler2007\" /> Buffetaut rejected this proposal in 2008, on the basis that the D-shaped cross section of the premaxillary and dentary teeth of ''Ceratosaurus'' is not seen in baryonychine teeth.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\n[[File:Palaeogeographic_locations_of_spinosaurids_(white)_and_the_specimen_of_HB_site_(black),_through_time_from_Bajocian\u2013Bathonian_(A),_Tithonian_(B),_Barremian\u2212Aptian_(C),_and_Albian\u2212Cenomanian_(D).jpg|thumb|left|Generalised locations of spinosaurid fossil discoveries from the [[Bajocian]]\u2013Bathonian (A), [[Tithonian]] (B), [[Barremian]]\u2212[[Aptian]] (C), and [[Albian]]\u2212[[Cenomanian]] (D) marked on maps of those time spans.]]\n\nThe main difference between ''Ostafrikasaurus'' and all other known spinosaurids, as Buffetaut noted, was in the large size of the denticles borne by the carinae. This led him to hypothesize in 2008 that spinosaurid dental evolution was primarily characterized by the shrinking and eventual loss of serrations. This pattern would start with the large serrations of primitive Jurassic taxa (MB R 1084), evolving into the fine and reduced serrations of Early Cretaceous baryonychines (like ''[[Suchomimus]]'' and ''Baryonyx''), and conclude with the heavily diminished (''[[Siamosaurus]]'') or completely absent (''[[Spinosaurus]]'') serrations of spinosaurines.<ref name=\":0\" />''<ref name=\"EBetal082\" />''<ref name=\"Ostafrikasaurus\" /> \n\nIn 2012, Buffetaut added that due to the presence of such a [[Basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] spinosaurid in Africa, spinosaurids may have been widespread early in their evolutionary history. He deemed this especially likely due to the discovery of spinosaurid fossils in Asia, which was likely separated from other continents during much of the Late Jurassic and Early Cretaceous as [[Pangaea]] continued breaking up.

The series is executive produced by Lauren LeFranc, [[Doug Liman]], [[David Bartis]], and Gene Klein. LeFranc also acts as showrunner for the series. In July 2018, the series was renewed for a second season consisting of ten episodes, which premiered on October 16, 2019. ''Impulse'' was canceled in March 2020.\n\n==Premise==\n''Impulse'' follows 16-year-old Henrietta \"Henry\" Coles who discovers she has the ability to [[Teleportation in fiction|teleport]] but has no control over her destination. The first time she realizes this, she is in a truck with her high school's basketball captain and star, Clay Boone, who tries to rape her. She has a seizure and teleports, in the course of which she inadvertently crushes much of his truck when her ability to teleport first manifests, leaving him a paraplegic. The show goes on to explore Henry's need to reconcile what her assailant tried to do with the consequence, and her feelings about discovering she can teleport and [[Psionics|psionically]] move objects from a distance, which are triggered by her feelings of fear regarding the assault.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n===Main===\n* [[Maddie Hasson]] as Henrietta \"Henry\" Coles, a teenage girl who possesses the ability to teleport, though has no control over her destination. She first realizes she has this capability while in the middle of being sexually assaulted. Her powers activate through emotional distress. She eventually is taught to control her powers. \n**Carina Battrick portrays a younger Henry Coles in a supporting role.\n*[[Sarah Desjardins]] as Jenna Faith Hope, Henry's soon-to-be stepsister and confidante. Initially cold and distant towards Henry, she becomes closer to her upon discovering that she was sexually assaulted. She soon begins questioning her sexuality.\n* [[Enuka Okuma]] as Anna Hulce, a deputy sheriff in Reston, investigating the incident which left Clay Boone physically disabled for life via his legs. She eventually witnesses a man teleporting away right before her eyes and confronts Henry about it.\n* Craig Arnold as Lucas Boone, a local mechanic, drug trafficker, and the eldest son of car and drug dealer Bill Boone. After spending time with the Millers and learning their religious ways, he returns to Reston and declares his unwavering devotion and allegiance to Henry as penance for what his father and brother put her through. \n* Tanner Stine as Clay Boone, a star of the local basketball team and Bill Boone's youngest son. A classmate of Henry's, Clay develops an interest in her when she begins attending school. While making out in his truck, he attempts to rape her. The assault causes her latent ability to teleport to activate, resulting in her having a seizure and teleporting away out of self-preservation. The resulting spatial distortion of Henry's escape crushes much of Clay's truck and leaves him without the use of his legs. (main season 1, guest season 2)\n* [[Keegan-Michael Key]] as Michael Pearce,{{efn|Credited among the main cast in the pilot only.}} a scientist at a gravitational wave detector.

He eventually mentors Henry on how to further develop and master her increasingly powerful abilities.\n\n===Recurring===\n{{div col|colwidth=33em}}\n* [[Matt Gordon]] as Thomas Hope, Jenna's father.

The first time she realizes this, she is in a truck with her high school's basketball captain and star, Clay Boone, who tries to rape her. She has a seizure and teleports, in the course of which she inadvertently crushes much of his truck when her ability to teleport first manifests, leaving him a paraplegic. The show goes on to explore Henry's need to reconcile what her assailant tried to do with the consequence, and her feelings about discovering she can teleport and [[Psionics|psionically]] move objects from a distance, which are triggered by her feelings of fear regarding the assault.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n===Main===\n* [[Maddie Hasson]] as Henrietta \"Henry\" Coles, a teenage girl who possesses the ability to teleport, though has no control over her destination.
