The property is somewhat hidden to passersby as it is surrounded by woods. The one and on half-story dwelling was built in several sections starting in 1802.

Before 1820, a two-room-plan frame addition was built onto the north end of the log dwelling; this became the main or front section of the house.

Aman and Middle-earth were separated from each other by the Great Sea [[Belegaer]], analogous to the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. The western continent, Aman, was the home of the [[Vala (Middle-earth) |Valar]], and the Elves called the [[Eldali\u00eb |Eldar]].<ref group=T>''[[The Silmarillion]]'', p. 31</ref><ref name=\"Garbowski 2013\"/>\n\nInitially, the western part of Middle-earth was the subcontinent [[Beleriand]]; it was engulfed by the ocean at the end of the [[First Age]].<ref name=\"Garbowski 2013\"/>\n\nAfter the destruction of [[N\u00famenor]] at the end of the [[Second Age]], Arda was remade as a round world, and the Undying Lands were removed from Arda so that [[Man (Middle-earth)|Men]] could not reach them. The [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elves]] could go there only by the [[Straight Road]] and in ships capable of passing out of the sphere of the earth.

Both [[quest]]s begin in [[The Shire]], travel east through the wilds of Eriador to [[Rivendell]] and then across the [[Misty Mountains]], involve further travels in the lands of [[Rhovanion]] or Wilderland to the east of those mountains, and return home to The Shire. \n\n===Eriador===\n\nIn the northwest of Middle-earth, Eriador was the region between the sea and the Misty Mountains; near the sea were the Ered Luin (also called Ered Lindon or Blue Mountains). In the Second Age, the northern kingdom of Arnor occupied much of the region. After its collapse, much of Eriador became wild. In the Third Age, a small part of the region was occupied by hobbits to form the Shire.\n\n===Misty Mountains===\n\nThe Misty Mountains were thrown up by the Dark Lord [[Melkor]] in the [[First Age]] to impede Orom\u00eb, one of the [[Valar]] who often rode across Middle-earth hunting.<ref group=T>''[[The Silmarillion]]'', ch. 3 \"Of the Coming of the Elves and the Captivity of Melkor\"</ref> The [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarf]]-realm of [[Moria (Middle-earth)|Moria]] was built in the First Age beneath the midpoint of the mountain range.

On its west bank opposite the southern end of Mirkwood is the [[Elf (Middle-earth)|elvish]] land of [[Lothlorien]]. Further south, backing on to the Misty Mountains, lies the forest of [[Fangorn]], home of the tree-giants, the [[ent]]s. In a valley at the southern end of the Misty Mountains is [[Isengard]], home to the [[wizard (Middle-earth)|wizard]] [[Saruman]]. \n\n===Lands to the south===\n[[File:Gondor sketch map.svg|thumb|upright=2|Sketch map of [[Gondor]] in the Third Age, bordered by [[Rohan (Middle-earth)|Rohan]] and [[Mordor]]]]\n\nJust to the south of both Fangorn and Isengard is the wide grassy land of the [[Riders of Rohan]], who provide [[cavalry]] to its southerly neighbour, [[Gondor]]. Gondor's border with Rohan is the Ered Nimrais, the White Mountains, which run east-west from the sea to a point near the River Anduin; at that point is Gondor's capital city, [[Minas Tirith]]. \n\nAcross the river to the east is the land of [[Mordor]]. It is bordered to the north by the Ered Lithui, the Ash Mountains; to the west by the Ephel Duath, the Mountains of Shadow. Between those two ranges, at Mordor's northwest tip, are the Black Gates of the [[Morannon]]. In the angle between the two ranges is the volcanic Plateau of Gorgoroth, with the tall volcano of Orodruin or [[Mount Doom]], where the Dark Lord [[Sauron]] forged the [[One Ring]], at its centre. To the mountain's east is Sauron's Dark Tower, [[Barad-dur]]. \n\nTo the south of Gondor and Mordor lies [[Harad]]. North of Mordor lies the Sea of Rhun, home to the Easterlings. North of that lie the Iron Hills of [[D\u00e1in II Ironfoot|Dain]]'s [[Dwarves (Middle-earth)|dwarves]]; between those and Mirkwood is [[Erebor]], the Lonely Mountain, once home to [[Smaug]] the [[Dragon (Middle-earth)|dragon]], and afterwards to [[Thorin Oakenshield|Thorin]]'s dwarves. \n\nThe lands to the east of Rhun and to the south and east of Harad are not described in the stories.<ref name=\"Magoun South 2013\">{{cite encyclopedia |last=Magoun |first=John F.

It was a flat world surrounded by ocean. It included the [[Aman (Tolkien)|Undying Lands of Aman]] and [[Eress\u00eba]], which were all part of the wider creation, [[E\u00e4]]. Aman and Middle-earth were separated from each other by the Great Sea [[Belegaer]], analogous to the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. The western continent, Aman, was the home of the [[Vala (Middle-earth) |Valar]], and the Elves called the [[Eldali\u00eb |Eldar]].<ref group=T>''[[The Silmarillion]]'', p. 31</ref><ref name=\"Garbowski 2013\"/>\n\nInitially, the western part of Middle-earth was the subcontinent [[Beleriand]]; it was engulfed by the ocean at the end of the [[First Age]].<ref name=\"Garbowski 2013\"/>\n\nAfter the destruction of [[N\u00famenor]] at the end of the [[Second Age]], Arda was remade as a round world, and the Undying Lands were removed from Arda so that [[Man (Middle-earth)|Men]] could not reach them. The [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elves]] could go there only by the [[Straight Road]] and in ships capable of passing out of the sphere of the earth. Tolkien then equated Arda, consisting of both Middle-earth's planet and the heavenly Aman, with the [[Solar System]], the Sun and Moon being celestial objects in their own right, no longer orbiting the Earth.<ref name=\"Garbowski 2013\"/><ref>{{cite journal |first=Kristine |last=Larsen |title=A Little Earth of His Own: Tolkien's Lunar Creation Myths |journal=In The Ring Goes Ever On: Proceedings of the Tolkien 2005 Conference |volume=2 |editor=Sarah Wells |publisher=The Tolkien Society |pages=394\u2013403 |year=2008}}</ref>\n\n== Physical geography ==\n\nThe events of ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' take place in the north-west of the continent of Middle-earth. Both [[quest]]s begin in [[The Shire]], travel east through the wilds of Eriador to [[Rivendell]] and then across the [[Misty Mountains]], involve further travels in the lands of [[Rhovanion]] or Wilderland to the east of those mountains, and return home to The Shire. \n\n===Eriador===\n\nIn the northwest of Middle-earth, Eriador was the region between the sea and the Misty Mountains; near the sea were the Ered Luin (also called Ered Lindon or Blue Mountains). In the Second Age, the northern kingdom of Arnor occupied much of the region. After its collapse, much of Eriador became wild. In the Third Age, a small part of the region was occupied by hobbits to form the Shire.\n\n===Misty Mountains===\n\nThe Misty Mountains were thrown up by the Dark Lord [[Melkor]] in the [[First Age]] to impede Orom\u00eb, one of the [[Valar]] who often rode across Middle-earth hunting.<ref group=T>''[[The Silmarillion]]'', ch. 3 \"Of the Coming of the Elves and the Captivity of Melkor\"</ref> The [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarf]]-realm of [[Moria (Middle-earth)|Moria]] was built in the First Age beneath the midpoint of the mountain range. The two major passes across the mountains were the High Pass or Pass of Imladris near [[Rivendell]], with a higher and a lower route,<ref group=T>''[[Unfinished Tales]]'', pp. 271, 281</ref><ref group=T>''[[The Annotated Hobbit]]'', p. 105</ref> and the all-year Redhorn Pass further south near Moria.<ref group=T>''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', book 2 ch. 3</ref>\n\n===Rhovanion===\n\nEast of the Misty Mountains, Anduin or the Great River flows southwards, with the forest of [[Mirkwood]] to its east. On its west bank opposite the southern end of Mirkwood is the [[Elf (Middle-earth)|elvish]] land of [[Lothlorien]]. Further south, backing on to the Misty Mountains, lies the forest of [[Fangorn]], home of the tree-giants, the [[ent]]s. In a valley at the southern end of the Misty Mountains is [[Isengard]], home to the [[wizard (Middle-earth)|wizard]] [[Saruman]]. \n\n===Lands to the south===\n[[File:Gondor sketch map.svg|thumb|upright=2|Sketch map of [[Gondor]] in the Third Age, bordered by [[Rohan (Middle-earth)|Rohan]] and [[Mordor]]]]\n\nJust to the south of both Fangorn and Isengard is the wide grassy land of the [[Riders of Rohan]], who provide [[cavalry]] to its southerly neighbour, [[Gondor]]. Gondor's border with Rohan is the Ered Nimrais, the White Mountains, which run east-west from the sea to a point near the River Anduin; at that point is Gondor's capital city, [[Minas Tirith]]. \n\nAcross the river to the east is the land of [[Mordor]]. It is bordered to the north by the Ered Lithui, the Ash Mountains; to the west by the Ephel Duath, the Mountains of Shadow. Between those two ranges, at Mordor's northwest tip, are the Black Gates of the [[Morannon]]. In the angle between the two ranges is the volcanic Plateau of Gorgoroth, with the tall volcano of Orodruin or [[Mount Doom]], where the Dark Lord [[Sauron]] forged the [[One Ring]], at its centre. To the mountain's east is Sauron's Dark Tower, [[Barad-dur]]. \n\nTo the south of Gondor and Mordor lies [[Harad]]. North of Mordor lies the Sea of Rhun, home to the Easterlings. North of that lie the Iron Hills of [[D\u00e1in II Ironfoot|Dain]]'s [[Dwarves (Middle-earth)|dwarves]]; between those and Mirkwood is [[Erebor]], the Lonely Mountain, once home to [[Smaug]] the [[Dragon (Middle-earth)|dragon]], and afterwards to [[Thorin Oakenshield|Thorin]]'s dwarves. \n\nThe lands to the east of Rhun and to the south and east of Harad are not described in the stories.<ref name=\"Magoun South 2013\">{{cite encyclopedia |last=Magoun |first=John F.

The major nations that appear in ''The Lord of the Rings'' are Rohan and Gondor on the side of the Free Peoples, and Mordor and its ally Harad on the side of the Dark Lord. Gondor, once extremely powerful, is by that time much reduced in its reach, and has lost control of Ithilien (bordering Mordor) and South Gondor (bordering Harad). \n\nThe Easterlings from the region of Rhun, barely described, contribute a substantial army to Mordor's side. \n\nForgotten by most of the rest of the world is [[The Shire]], a small region in the northwest of Middle-earth inhabited by hobbits amidst the abandoned lands of Eriador.\n\n== Moral geography ==\n[[File:Tolkien's Moral Geography of Middle-Earth.svg|thumb|upright=2|Tolkien's moral geography of Middle-earth, according to John Magoun<ref name=\"Magoun\"/>|alt=Tolkien's moral geography of Middle-earth, good in the west, evil in the east, simple in the north, sophisticated in the south.
