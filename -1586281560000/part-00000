{"title_page": "Hopf algebra", "text_new": "{{Use American English|date=January 2019}}{{Short description|Construction in algebra\n}}\nIn [[mathematics]], a '''Hopf algebra''', named after [[Heinz Hopf]], is a structure that is simultaneously an ([[unital algebra|unital]] associative) [[Associative algebra|algebra]] and a (counital coassociative) [[coalgebra]], with these structures' compatibility making it a [[bialgebra]], and that moreover is equipped with an [[antiautomorphism]] satisfying a certain property. The [[representation theory]] of a Hopf algebra is particularly nice, since the existence of compatible comultiplication, counit, and antipode allows for the construction of tensor products of representations, trivial representations, and dual representations.\n\nHopf algebras occur naturally in [[algebraic topology]], where they originated and are related to the [[H-space]] concept, in [[group scheme]] theory, in [[group theory]] (via the concept of a [[group ring]]), and in numerous other places, making them probably the most familiar type of [[bialgebra]]. Hopf algebras are also studied in their own right, with much work on specific classes of examples on the one hand and classification problems on the other. They have diverse applications ranging from [[condensed-matter physics]] and [[quantum field theory]]<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Haldane | first1 = F. D. M. | last2 = Ha | first2 = Z. N.

In other words, a Hopf subalgebra A is a Hopf algebra in its own right when the multiplication, comultiplication, counit and antipode of ''H'' is restricted to ''A'' (and additionally the identity 1 of ''H'' is  required to be in A). The Nichols\u2013Zoeller freeness theorem  established (in 1989) that the natural ''A''-module ''H'' is free of finite rank if ''H'' is finite-dimensional: a generalization of [[Lagrange's theorem (group theory)|Lagrange's theorem for subgroups]]. As a corollary of this and integral theory, a Hopf subalgebra of a semisimple finite-dimensional Hopf algebra is automatically semisimple.\n\nA Hopf subalgebra ''A'' is said to be right normal in a Hopf algebra ''H'' if it satisfies the condition of stability, ''ad<sub>r</sub>''(''h'')(''A'') \u2286 ''A'' for all ''h'' in ''H'', where the right adjoint mapping ''ad<sub>r</sub>'' is defined by ''ad<sub>r</sub>''(''h'')(''a'') = ''S''(''h''<sub>(1)</sub>)''ah''<sub>(2)</sub> for all ''a'' in ''A'', ''h'' in ''H''. Similarly, a Hopf subalgebra ''A'' is left normal in ''H'' if it is stable under the left adjoint mapping defined by ''ad<sub>l</sub>''(''h'')(''a'') = ''h''<sub>(1)</sub>''aS''(''h''<sub>(2)</sub>). The two conditions of normality are equivalent if the antipode ''S'' is bijective, in which case ''A'' is said to be a normal Hopf subalgebra.\n\nA normal Hopf subalgebra ''A'' in ''H'' satisfies the condition (of equality of subsets of H): ''HA''<sup>+</sup> = ''A''<sup>+</sup>''H'' where ''A''<sup>+</sup> denotes the kernel of the counit on ''K''. This normality condition implies that ''HA''<sup>+</sup> is a Hopf ideal of ''H'' (i.e. an algebra ideal in the kernel of the counit, a coalgebra coideal and stable under the antipode). As a consequence one has a quotient Hopf algebra ''H''/''HA''<sup>+</sup> and epimorphism ''H'' \u2192 ''H''/''A''<sup>+</sup>''H'', a theory analogous to that of normal subgroups and quotient groups in [[group theory]].<ref>Montgomery (1993) p.36</ref>\n\n===Hopf orders===\nA '''Hopf order''' ''O'' over an [[integral domain]] ''R'' with [[field of fractions]] ''K'' is an [[Order (ring theory)|order]] in a Hopf algebra ''H'' over ''K'' which is closed under the algebra and coalgebra operations: in particular, the comultiplication \u0394 maps ''O'' to ''O''\u2297''O''.<ref name=Und82>Underwood (2011) p.82</ref>\n\n===Group-like elements===\nA '''group-like element''' is a nonzero element ''x'' such that \u0394(''x'') = ''x''\u2297''x''.

Other interesting Hopf algebras are certain \"deformations\" or \"[[quantization (physics)|quantization]]s\" of those from example 3 which are neither commutative nor co-commutative. These Hopf algebras are often called ''[[quantum groups]]'', a term that is so far only loosely defined. They are important in [[noncommutative geometry]], the idea being the following: a standard algebraic group is well described by its standard Hopf algebra of regular functions; we can then think of the deformed version of this Hopf algebra as describing a certain \"non-standard\" or \"quantized\" algebraic group (which is not an algebraic group at all). While there does not seem to be a direct way to define or manipulate these non-standard objects, one can still work with their Hopf algebras, and indeed one ''identifies'' them with their Hopf algebras. Hence the name \"quantum group\".\n\n==Representation theory==\nLet ''A'' be a Hopf algebra, and let ''M'' and ''N'' be ''A''-modules. Then, ''M'' \u2297 ''N'' is also an ''A''-module, with\n:<math>a(m\\otimes n):=\\Delta(a)(m \\otimes n)=(a_1\\otimes a_2)(m\\otimes n)=(a_1 m \\otimes a_2 n)</math>\nfor ''m'' \u2208 ''M'', ''n'' \u2208 ''N'' and \u0394(''a'') = (''a''<sub>1</sub>, ''a''<sub>2</sub>). Furthermore, we can define the trivial representation as the base field ''K'' with\n:<math>a(m):=\\epsilon(a)m</math>\nfor ''m'' \u2208 ''K''. Finally, the dual representation of ''A'' can be defined: if ''M'' is an ''A''-module and ''M*'' is its dual space, then\n:<math>(af)(m):=f(S(a)m)</math>\nwhere ''f'' \u2208 ''M*'' and ''m'' \u2208 ''M''.\n\nThe relationship between \u0394, \u03b5, and ''S'' ensure that certain natural homomorphisms of vector spaces are indeed homomorphisms of ''A''-modules. For instance, the natural isomorphisms of vector spaces ''M'' \u2192 ''M'' \u2297 ''K'' and ''M'' \u2192 ''K'' \u2297 ''M'' are also isomorphisms of ''A''-modules. Also, the map of vector spaces ''M*'' \u2297 ''M'' \u2192 ''K'' with ''f'' \u2297 ''m'' \u2192 ''f''(''m'') is also a homomorphism of ''A''-modules. However, the map ''M'' \u2297 ''M*'' \u2192 ''K'' is not necessarily a homomorphism of ''A''-modules.\n\n== Related concepts ==\n[[Graded algebra|Graded]] Hopf algebras are often used in [[algebraic topology]]: they are the natural algebraic structure on the direct sum of all [[homology (mathematics)|homology]] or [[cohomology]] groups of an [[H-space]].\n\n[[Locally compact quantum group]]s generalize Hopf algebras and carry a [[topological space|topology]].

Like Hopf algebras, weak Hopf algebras form a self-dual class of algebras; i.e., if ''H'' is a (weak) Hopf algebra, so is ''H''*, the dual space of linear forms on ''H'' (with respect to the algebra-coalgebra structure obtained from  the natural pairing with ''H'' and its coalgebra-algebra structure). A weak Hopf algebra ''H'' is usually taken to be a\n*finite-dimensional algebra and coalgebra with coproduct \u0394: ''H'' \u2192 ''H'' \u2297 ''H''  and counit \u03b5: ''H'' \u2192 ''k'' satisfying all the axioms of Hopf algebra except possibly \u0394(1) \u2260 1 \u2297 1 or \u03b5(''ab'') \u2260 \u03b5(''a'')\u03b5(''b'') for some ''a,b'' in ''H''. Instead one requires the following:\n\n::<math> (\\Delta(1) \\otimes 1)(1 \\otimes \\Delta(1)) = (1 \\otimes \\Delta(1))(\\Delta(1) \\otimes 1) = (\\Delta \\otimes \\mbox{Id})\\Delta(1)</math>\n::<math> \\epsilon(abc) = \\sum \\epsilon(ab_{(1)})\\epsilon(b_{(2)}c) = \\sum \\epsilon(ab_{(2)})\\epsilon(b_{(1)}c)</math>\n\n:for all ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'' in ''H''.\n* ''H'' has a weakened antipode ''S'': ''H'' \u2192 ''H'' satisfying the axioms:\n\n#<math>S(a_{(1)})a_{(2)} = 1_{(1)} \\epsilon(a 1_{(2)})</math> for all ''a'' in ''H'' (the right-hand side is the interesting projection usually denoted by \u03a0<sup>''R''</sup>(''a'') or \u03b5<sub>''s''</sub>(''a'') with image a separable subalgebra denoted by ''H<sup>R</sup>'' or ''H<sub>s</sub>''); \n#<math>a_{(1)}S(a_{(2)}) =  \\epsilon(1_{(1)}a)1_{(2)}</math> for all ''a'' in ''H'' (another interesting projection usually denoted by \u03a0<sup>''R''</sup>(''a'') or \u03b5<sub>''t''</sub>(''a'') with image a separable algebra ''H<sup>L</sup>'' or ''H<sub>t</sub>'', anti-isomorphic to ''H<sup>L</sup>'' via ''S'');\n#<math>S(a_{(1)})a_{(2)}S(a_{(3)}) = S(a) </math> for all ''a'' in ''H''.\n\n:Note that if \u0394(1) = 1 \u2297 1, these conditions reduce to the two usual conditions on the antipode of a Hopf algebra.\n\nThe axioms are partly chosen so that the category of ''H''-modules is a [[rigid category|rigid monoidal category]]. The unit ''H''-module is the separable algebra ''H<sup>L</sup>'' mentioned above. \n \nFor example, a finite [[groupoid]] algebra is a weak Hopf algebra. In particular, the groupoid algebra on [n] with one pair of invertible arrows ''e<sub>ij</sub>'' and ''e<sub>ji</sub>''  between ''i'' and ''j'' in [''n''] is isomorphic to the algebra ''H'' of ''n'' x ''n'' matrices. The weak Hopf algebra structure on this particular ''H'' is given by coproduct \u0394(''e<sub>ij</sub>'') = ''e<sub>ij</sub>'' \u2297 ''e<sub>ij</sub>'', counit \u03b5(''e<sub>ij</sub>'') = 1 and antipode ''S''(''e<sub>ij</sub>'') = ''e<sub>ji</sub>''. The separable subalgebras ''H<sup>L</sup>'' and ''H<sup>R</sup>'' coincide and are non-central commutative algebras in this particular case (the subalgebra of diagonal matrices).\n\nEarly theoretical contributions to weak Hopf algebras are to be found in<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = B\u00f6hm | first1 = Gabriella | last2 = Nill | first2 = Florian | last3 = Szlachanyi | first3 = Kornel | year = 1999 | title =  Weak Hopf Algebras| url = | journal = J.

In other words, a Hopf subalgebra A is a Hopf algebra in its own right when the multiplication, comultiplication, counit and antipode of ''H'' is restricted to ''A'' (and additionally the identity 1 of ''H'' is  required to be in A). The Nichols\u2013Zoeller freeness theorem  established (in 1989) that the natural ''A''-module ''H'' is free of finite rank if ''H'' is finite-dimensional: a generalization of [[Lagrange's theorem (group theory)|Lagrange's theorem for subgroups]]. As a corollary of this and integral theory, a Hopf subalgebra of a semisimple finite-dimensional Hopf algebra is automatically semisimple.\n\nA Hopf subalgebra ''A'' is said to be right normal in a Hopf algebra ''H'' if it satisfies the condition of stability, ''ad<sub>r</sub>''(''h'')(''A'') \u2286 ''A'' for all ''h'' in ''H'', where the right adjoint mapping ''ad<sub>r</sub>'' is defined by ''ad<sub>r</sub>''(''h'')(''a'') = ''S''(''h''<sub>(1)</sub>)''ah''<sub>(2)</sub> for all ''a'' in ''A'', ''h'' in ''H''. Similarly, a Hopf subalgebra ''A'' is left normal in ''H'' if it is stable under the left adjoint mapping defined by ''ad<sub>l</sub>''(''h'')(''a'') = ''h''<sub>(1)</sub>''aS''(''h''<sub>(2)</sub>). The two conditions of normality are equivalent if the antipode ''S'' is bijective, in which case ''A'' is said to be a normal Hopf subalgebra.\n\nA normal Hopf subalgebra ''A'' in ''H'' satisfies the condition (of equality of subsets of H): ''HA''<sup>+</sup> = ''A''<sup>+</sup>''H'' where ''A''<sup>+</sup> denotes the kernel of the counit on ''K''. This normality condition implies that ''HA''<sup>+</sup> is a Hopf ideal of ''H'' (i.e. an algebra ideal in the kernel of the counit, a coalgebra coideal and stable under the antipode). As a consequence one has a quotient Hopf algebra ''H''/''HA''<sup>+</sup> and epimorphism ''H'' \u2192 ''H''/''A''<sup>+</sup>''H'', a theory analogous to that of normal subgroups and quotient groups in [[group theory]].<ref>Montgomery (1993) p.36</ref>\n\n===Hopf orders===\nA '''Hopf order''' ''O'' over an [[integral domain]] ''R'' with [[field of fractions]] ''K'' is an [[Order (ring theory)|order]] in a Hopf algebra ''H'' over ''K'' which is closed under the algebra and coalgebra operations: in particular, the comultiplication \u0394 maps ''O'' to ''O''\u2297''O''.<ref name=Und82>Underwood (2011) p.82</ref>\n\n===Group-like elements===\nA '''group-like element''' is a nonzero element ''x'' such that \u0394(''x'') = ''x''\u2297''x''.

Other interesting Hopf algebras are certain \"deformations\" or \"[[quantization (physics)|quantization]]s\" of those from example 3 which are neither commutative nor co-commutative. These Hopf algebras are often called ''[[quantum groups]]'', a term that is so far only loosely defined. They are important in [[noncommutative geometry]], the idea being the following: a standard algebraic group is well described by its standard Hopf algebra of regular functions; we can then think of the deformed version of this Hopf algebra as describing a certain \"non-standard\" or \"quantized\" algebraic group (which is not an algebraic group at all). While there does not seem to be a direct way to define or manipulate these non-standard objects, one can still work with their Hopf algebras, and indeed one ''identifies'' them with their Hopf algebras. Hence the name \"quantum group\".\n\n==Representation theory==\nLet ''A'' be a Hopf algebra, and let ''M'' and ''N'' be ''A''-modules. Then, ''M'' \u2297 ''N'' is also an ''A''-module, with\n:<math>a(m\\otimes n):=\\Delta(a)(m \\otimes n)=(a_1\\otimes a_2)(m\\otimes n)=(a_1 m \\otimes a_2 n)</math>\nfor ''m'' \u2208 ''M'', ''n'' \u2208 ''N'' and \u0394(''a'') = (''a''<sub>1</sub>, ''a''<sub>2</sub>). Furthermore, we can define the trivial representation as the base field ''K'' with\n:<math>a(m):=\\epsilon(a)m</math>\nfor ''m'' \u2208 ''K''. Finally, the dual representation of ''A'' can be defined: if ''M'' is an ''A''-module and ''M*'' is its dual space, then\n:<math>(af)(m):=f(S(a)m)</math>\nwhere ''f'' \u2208 ''M*'' and ''m'' \u2208 ''M''.\n\nThe relationship between \u0394, \u03b5, and ''S'' ensure that certain natural homomorphisms of vector spaces are indeed homomorphisms of ''A''-modules. For instance, the natural isomorphisms of vector spaces ''M'' \u2192 ''M'' \u2297 ''K'' and ''M'' \u2192 ''K'' \u2297 ''M'' are also isomorphisms of ''A''-modules. Also, the map of vector spaces ''M*'' \u2297 ''M'' \u2192 ''K'' with ''f'' \u2297 ''m'' \u2192 ''f''(''m'') is also a homomorphism of ''A''-modules. However, the map ''M'' \u2297 ''M*'' \u2192 ''K'' is not necessarily a homomorphism of ''A''-modules.\n\n== Related concepts ==\n[[Graded algebra|Graded]] Hopf algebras are often used in [[algebraic topology]]: they are the natural algebraic structure on the direct sum of all [[homology (mathematics)|homology]] or [[cohomology]] groups of an [[H-space]].\n\n[[Locally compact quantum group]]s generalize Hopf algebras and carry a [[topological space|topology]]. The algebra of all [[continuous function]]s on a [[Lie group]] is a locally compact quantum group.\n\n[[Quasi-Hopf algebra]]s are generalizations of Hopf algebras, where coassociativity only holds up to a twist.

G. Turaev in 2000 are also generalizations of Hopf algebras.\n\n===Weak Hopf algebras===\n[[Weak Hopf algebra]]s, or quantum groupoids, are  generalizations of Hopf algebras. Like Hopf algebras, weak Hopf algebras form a self-dual class of algebras; i.e., if ''H'' is a (weak) Hopf algebra, so is ''H''*, the dual space of linear forms on ''H'' (with respect to the algebra-coalgebra structure obtained from  the natural pairing with ''H'' and its coalgebra-algebra structure). A weak Hopf algebra ''H'' is usually taken to be a\n*finite-dimensional algebra and coalgebra with coproduct \u0394: ''H'' \u2192 ''H'' \u2297 ''H''  and counit \u03b5: ''H'' \u2192 ''k'' satisfying all the axioms of Hopf algebra except possibly \u0394(1) \u2260 1 \u2297 1 or \u03b5(''ab'') \u2260 \u03b5(''a'')\u03b5(''b'') for some ''a,b'' in ''H''. Instead one requires the following:\n\n::<math> (\\Delta(1) \\otimes 1)(1 \\otimes \\Delta(1)) = (1 \\otimes \\Delta(1))(\\Delta(1) \\otimes 1) = (\\Delta \\otimes \\mbox{Id})\\Delta(1)</math>\n::<math> \\epsilon(abc) = \\sum \\epsilon(ab_{(1)})\\epsilon(b_{(2)}c) = \\sum \\epsilon(ab_{(2)})\\epsilon(b_{(1)}c)</math>\n\n:for all ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'' in ''H''.\n* ''H'' has a weakened antipode ''S'': ''H'' \u2192 ''H'' satisfying the axioms:\n\n#<math>S(a_{(1)})a_{(2)} = 1_{(1)} \\epsilon(a 1_{(2)})</math> for all ''a'' in ''H'' (the right-hand side is the interesting projection usually denoted by \u03a0<sup>''R''</sup>(''a'') or \u03b5<sub>''s''</sub>(''a'') with image a separable subalgebra denoted by ''H<sup>R</sup>'' or ''H<sub>s</sub>''); \n#<math>a_{(1)}S(a_{(2)}) =  \\epsilon(1_{(1)}a)1_{(2)}</math> for all ''a'' in ''H'' (another interesting projection usually denoted by \u03a0<sup>''R''</sup>(''a'') or \u03b5<sub>''t''</sub>(''a'') with image a separable algebra ''H<sup>L</sup>'' or ''H<sub>t</sub>'', anti-isomorphic to ''H<sup>L</sup>'' via ''S'');\n#<math>S(a_{(1)})a_{(2)}S(a_{(3)}) = S(a) </math> for all ''a'' in ''H''.\n\n:Note that if \u0394(1) = 1 \u2297 1, these conditions reduce to the two usual conditions on the antipode of a Hopf algebra.\n\nThe axioms are partly chosen so that the category of ''H''-modules is a [[rigid category|rigid monoidal category]]. The unit ''H''-module is the separable algebra ''H<sup>L</sup>'' mentioned above. \n \nFor example, a finite [[groupoid]] algebra is a weak Hopf algebra. In particular, the groupoid algebra on [n] with one pair of invertible arrows ''e<sub>ij</sub>'' and ''e<sub>ji</sub>''  between ''i'' and ''j'' in [''n''] is isomorphic to the algebra ''H'' of ''n'' x ''n'' matrices. The weak Hopf algebra structure on this particular ''H'' is given by coproduct \u0394(''e<sub>ij</sub>'') = ''e<sub>ij</sub>'' \u2297 ''e<sub>ij</sub>'', counit \u03b5(''e<sub>ij</sub>'') = 1 and antipode ''S''(''e<sub>ij</sub>'') = ''e<sub>ji</sub>''. The separable subalgebras ''H<sup>L</sup>'' and ''H<sup>R</sup>'' coincide and are non-central commutative algebras in this particular case (the subalgebra of diagonal matrices).\n\nEarly theoretical contributions to weak Hopf algebras are to be found in<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = B\u00f6hm | first1 = Gabriella | last2 = Nill | first2 = Florian | last3 = Szlachanyi | first3 = Kornel | year = 1999 | title =  Weak Hopf Algebras| url = | journal = J.

It was created by King [[Charles&nbsp;IV of Spain]] in 1792 for [[Manuel Godoy]], who was the [[List of Prime Ministers of Spain|Prime Minister of Spain]] from 1792 to 1797 and from 1801 to 1808. Its name refers to the ''[[:es:Valle de Alcudia|Valle de Alcudia]]'' in the [[Province of Ciudad Real]] in Spain.\n\n==Manuel Godoy==\n[[File:Agustin Esteve y Marqu\u00e9s - Manuel Godoy - 1954.312 - Art Institute of Chicago.jpg|thumb|300x300px|[[Manuel Godoy]], Prince of the Peace, 1st Duke of la Alcudia, 1st Duke of Sueca, Count of \u00c9voramonte, Baron of Mascalb\u00f3, Prime Minister of [[Charles&nbsp;IV of Spain]]]]\nKing Charles IV also granted to Manuel Godoy the Duchy of Sueca, the Barony of Mascalb\u00f3 and the title of Prince of the Peace. The granting of the latter was an exception in Spanish noble history; since the Middle Ages, no one had held the princely dignity in Spain except the heir of the crown, who did so through three titles: [[Prince of Asturias]], Gerona and of Viana. \n\nHe was granted the Portuguese county of \u00c9voramonte, which was due to his marriage to the [[Countess of Chinch\u00f3n]]. However, he was exiled in 1808 when Spain came under [[Kingdom of Spain under Joseph Bonaparte|Bonaparte rule]], and he was not authorized to return to Spain until 1844. \n\nGodoy was also, by papal concession, Prince of Bassano, a title he obtained after acquiring the Italian fief of Bassano di Sutri, located between Rome and Viterbo, during his long exile in Rome.\n\nIt seems that he was also \"Marqu\u00e9s de \u00c1lvarez\", as it is named in different documents, although it is a title that was never used by his successors, nor has anyone attempted to rehabilitate it, nor is it stated in the Cast of Greatness and Titles Nobiliarios Espa\u00f1oles or in the Directory of the ''Diputaci\u00f3n de la Grandeza''.

The granting of the latter was an exception in Spanish noble history; since the Middle Ages, no one had held the princely dignity in Spain except the heir of the crown, who did so through three titles: [[Prince of Asturias]], Gerona and of Viana. \n\nHe was granted the Portuguese county of \u00c9voramonte, which was due to his marriage to the [[Countess of Chinch\u00f3n]]. However, he was exiled in 1808 when Spain came under [[Kingdom of Spain under Joseph Bonaparte|Bonaparte rule]], and he was not authorized to return to Spain until 1844. \n\nGodoy was also, by papal concession, Prince of Bassano, a title he obtained after acquiring the Italian fief of Bassano di Sutri, located between Rome and Viterbo, during his long exile in Rome.\n\nIt seems that he was also \"Marqu\u00e9s de \u00c1lvarez\", as it is named in different documents, although it is a title that was never used by his successors, nor has anyone attempted to rehabilitate it, nor is it stated in the Cast of Greatness and Titles Nobiliarios Espa\u00f1oles or in the Directory of the ''Diputaci\u00f3n de la Grandeza''.

According to the [[Smithsonian Institution]]'s [[Global Volcanism Program]],<ref name=\"smithsonian\">{{cite gvp|vnum=1505-13=|title=Ojos del Salado}}</ref> the most recent known eruption was about 1,300 years ago, with a large margin of uncertainty. However, there is also some evidence for a minor ash emission in 1993, which would definitely qualify the volcano as historically active. The presence of [[fumarole]]s high on the mountain and recent-looking [[lava]] flows, albeit of uncertain age, also argues in favor of a categorization as \"active.\"  By these definitions, Ojos del Salado is the highest historically active volcano on Earth. If the older date is accepted, the title of \"highest historically active volcano\" might reside instead with the somewhat lower [[Llullaillaco]] volcano, which certainly has erupted in historic times (most recently in 1877) and is considered active.\n\n===Composition===\nSalado's rock is predominantly [[potassium]]-rich [[dacite]] and [[rhyodacite]]. Its lavas are high in [[biotite]], [[hornblende]], [[plagioclase]], and opaques, with lower levels of [[augite]], quartz, and [[hypersthene]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://volcano.oregonstate.edu/oldroot/CVZ/ojossalado/index.html|title=Nevados Ojos del Salado|publisher=[[Oregon State University]]|work=Volcano World|year=2011|accessdate=July 29, 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Elevation==\nThe elevation of Ojos del Salado has been the subject of debate. The mountain is hidden behind other peaks and thus its height was not appreciated in early research until 1937, when the mountain was climbed by Polish climbers.<ref>Carter 1957, pp.240-241</ref>\n\nA 2006 article in Andes Magazine offered that Ojos del Salado may be higher than Aconcagua, although the argument was premised on older, less accurate altitude surveys. The results of these older surveys assigned Ojos del Salado an elevation of {{convert|7057|m|abbr=on}}, which would have made it nearly {{convert|100|m|abbr=on}} higher than Aconcagua. As early as 1955, an estimate was made that the elevation of Ojos del Salado was {{convert|7100|m|abbr=on}}, but that was \"simply [...] based on the altitude of the final camp, and the hours of ascent to the summit.\"<ref name=\"aaj_1956\">''American Alpine Journal'', 1956, p. 134; quoting the \"Boletin Informativo No. 16\" (June 1955) of the Argentine ''Associaci\u00f3n Tucumana de Andismo''.</ref> In 1956, the first Chilean expedition led by the retired [[lieutenant]] Ren\u00e9 Gajardo measured the height of Ojos del Salado as {{convert|7084|m|abbr=on}} with a pocket pressure [[altimeter]].

Later measurements using more precise equipment showed that Ojos del Salado is about {{convert|100|m|abbr=on}} higher than Pissis. Furthermore, in 2007 a Chilean\u2013Argentine\u2013European expedition organized by Andes Magazine and Azimut 360 performed a survey on both Ojos del Salado and Monte Pissis using more accurate instruments.

According to the [[Smithsonian Institution]]'s [[Global Volcanism Program]],<ref name=\"smithsonian\">{{cite gvp|vnum=1505-13=|title=Ojos del Salado}}</ref> the most recent known eruption was about 1,300 years ago, with a large margin of uncertainty. However, there is also some evidence for a minor ash emission in 1993, which would definitely qualify the volcano as historically active. The presence of [[fumarole]]s high on the mountain and recent-looking [[lava]] flows, albeit of uncertain age, also argues in favor of a categorization as \"active.\"  By these definitions, Ojos del Salado is the highest historically active volcano on Earth. If the older date is accepted, the title of \"highest historically active volcano\" might reside instead with the somewhat lower [[Llullaillaco]] volcano, which certainly has erupted in historic times (most recently in 1877) and is considered active.\n\n===Composition===\nSalado's rock is predominantly [[potassium]]-rich [[dacite]] and [[rhyodacite]]. Its lavas are high in [[biotite]], [[hornblende]], [[plagioclase]], and opaques, with lower levels of [[augite]], quartz, and [[hypersthene]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://volcano.oregonstate.edu/oldroot/CVZ/ojossalado/index.html|title=Nevados Ojos del Salado|publisher=[[Oregon State University]]|work=Volcano World|year=2011|accessdate=July 29, 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Elevation==\nThe elevation of Ojos del Salado has been the subject of debate. The mountain is hidden behind other peaks and thus its height was not appreciated in early research until 1937, when the mountain was climbed by Polish climbers.<ref>Carter 1957, pp.240-241</ref>\n\nA 2006 article in Andes Magazine offered that Ojos del Salado may be higher than Aconcagua, although the argument was premised on older, less accurate altitude surveys. The results of these older surveys assigned Ojos del Salado an elevation of {{convert|7057|m|abbr=on}}, which would have made it nearly {{convert|100|m|abbr=on}} higher than Aconcagua. As early as 1955, an estimate was made that the elevation of Ojos del Salado was {{convert|7100|m|abbr=on}}, but that was \"simply [...] based on the altitude of the final camp, and the hours of ascent to the summit.\"<ref name=\"aaj_1956\">''American Alpine Journal'', 1956, p. 134; quoting the \"Boletin Informativo No. 16\" (June 1955) of the Argentine ''Associaci\u00f3n Tucumana de Andismo''.</ref> In 1956, the first Chilean expedition led by the retired [[lieutenant]] Ren\u00e9 Gajardo measured the height of Ojos del Salado as {{convert|7084|m|abbr=on}} with a pocket pressure [[altimeter]].

Later measurements using more precise equipment showed that Ojos del Salado is about {{convert|100|m|abbr=on}} higher than Pissis. Furthermore, in 2007 a Chilean\u2013Argentine\u2013European expedition organized by Andes Magazine and Azimut 360 performed a survey on both Ojos del Salado and Monte Pissis using more accurate instruments.

The group was able to return to urban areas and form relationships with legal opposition organizations, and became increasingly successful in attacks against the government throughout the country.<ref name=\"web.stanford.edu\"/> The violence inflicted by the communists reached its peak in 1985 with 1,282 military and police deaths and 1,362 civilian deaths.<ref name=\"web.stanford.edu\"/>\n\n===Aquino's assassination===\n{{Main|Assassination of Benigno Aquino Jr.}}\nOn August 21, 1983, opposition leader [[Benigno Aquino Jr.]] was assassinated on the tarmac at [[Ninoy Aquino International Airport|Manila International Airport]]. He had returned to the Philippines after three years in exile in the United States, where he had a heart bypass operation to save his life after Marcos allowed him to leave the Philippines to seek medical care. Prior to his heart surgery, Ninoy, along with his two co-accused, [[New People's Army|NPA]] leaders [[Bernabe Buscayno]] (Commander Dante) and Lt. Victor Corpuz, were sentenced to death by a military commission on charges of murder, illegal possession of firearms and subversion.<ref name=\"asianjournalusa.com\"/>\n\nA few months before his assassination, Ninoy had decided to return to the Philippines after his research fellowship from [[Harvard University]] had finished. The opposition blamed Marcos directly for the assassination while others blamed the military and his wife, Imelda. Popular speculation pointed to three suspects; the first was Marcos himself through his trusted military chief Fabian Ver; the second theory pointed to his wife Imelda who had her own burning ambition now that her ailing husband seemed to be getting weaker, and the third theory was that [[Eduardo Cojuangco Jr.|Danding Cojuangco]] planned the assassination because of his own political ambitions.<ref name=\"inquirerOrderedHit\">{{cite web|url=http://globalnation.inquirer.net/columns/columns/view/20090819-221072/Who-ordered-the-hit-on-Ninoy-Aquino|title=Who ordered the hit on Ninoy Aquino?|last=Rodis|first=Rodel|work=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]|date=August 19, 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141002103332/http://globalnation.inquirer.net/columns/columns/view/20090819-221072/Who-ordered-the-hit-on-Ninoy-Aquino|archivedate=October 2, 2014}}</ref> The 1985 acquittals of Chief of Staff General [[Fabian Ver]] as well as other high-ranking military officers charged with the crime were widely seen as a [[Whitewash (censorship)|whitewash]] and a miscarriage of justice.\n\nOn November 22, 2007, Pablo Martinez, one of the convicted suspects in the assassination of Ninoy Aquino Jr. alleged that it was Ninoy Aquino Jr.'s relative, Danding Cojuangco, cousin of his wife Corazon Cojuangco Aquino, who ordered the assassination of Ninoy Aquino Jr. while Marcos was recuperating from his kidney transplant. Martinez also alleged only he and Galman knew of the assassination, and that Galman was the actual shooter, which is not corroborated by other evidence of the case.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archives.newsbreak-knowledge.ph/2007/11/23/transcript-of-abs-cbn-interview-with-pablo-martinez-co-accused-in-the-aquino-murder-case/|title=Transcript of ABS-CBN Interview with Pablo Martinez, co-accused in the Aquino murder case|accessdate=April 19, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150628232250/http://archives.newsbreak-knowledge.ph/2007/11/23/transcript-of-abs-cbn-interview-with-pablo-martinez-co-accused-in-the-aquino-murder-case/|archive-date=June 28, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Impeachment attempt===\n\nIn August 1985, 56 Assemblymen signed a resolution calling for the [[impeachment]] of President Marcos for alleged diversion of U.S. aid for personal use,<ref>{{cite book|author=Blitz, Amy|title=The contested state: American foreign policy and regime change in the Philippines|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|year=2000|isbn=978-0-8476-9934-6|pages=167\u2013168|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n2rdOhMdCDEC&pg=PA167}}</ref> citing a July 1985 ''[[San Jose Mercury News]]'' expos\u00e9 of the Marcos's multimillion-dollar investment and property holdings in the United States.\n\nThe properties allegedly amassed by the First Family were the Crown Building, Lindenmere Estate, and a number of residential apartments (in New Jersey and New York), a shopping center in New York, mansions (in London, Rome and Honolulu), the Helen Knudsen Estate in Hawaii and three condominiums in San Francisco, California.\n\nThe Assembly also included in the complaint the misuse and misapplication of funds \"for the construction of the [[Manila Film Center]], where X-rated and pornographic films{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} are exhibited, contrary to public morals and Filipino customs and traditions.\" The impeachment attempt gained little real traction, however, even in the light of this incendiary charge; the committee to which the impeachment resolution was referred did not recommend it, and any momentum for removing Marcos under constitutional processes soon died.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\n===Physical decline===\n\n{{See also|People Power Revolution}}\nDuring his third term, Marcos's health deteriorated rapidly due to kidney ailments, as a complication of a chronic autoimmune disease ''[[lupus erythematosus]]''.

One of the most important economic programs in the 1980s was the ''Kilusang Kabuhayan at Kaunlaran'' (Movement for Livelihood and Progress). This program was started in September 1981.

This was taking place at the same time that China was beginning to accept free-market capitalism and American businesses were jockeying to establish manufacturing plants in China. The political troubles of the Philippines hindered the entry of foreign investments, and foreign banks stopped granting loans to the Philippine government.\n\nIn an attempt to launch a national economic recovery program and despite his growing isolation from American businesses, Marcos negotiated with foreign creditors including the [[International Bank for Reconstruction and Development]], [[World Bank]], and the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), for a restructuring of the country's foreign debts \u2013 to give the Philippines more time to pay the loans. Marcos ordered a cut in government expenditures and used a portion of the savings to finance the ''Sariling Sikap'' (Self-Reliance), a livelihood program he established in 1984.\n\nHowever, the economy continued to shrink despite the government's recovery efforts due to a number of reasons. Most of the so-called government development programs failed to materialize. Government funds were often siphoned off by Marcos or his cronies. American investors were discouraged by the Filipino economic elite who were against the corruption that by now had become endemic in the Marcos regime.<ref name=\"albert\">{{cite book|last1=Celoza|first1=Albert|title=Ferdinand Marcos and the Philippines: The Political Economy of Authoritarianism|date=November 25, 1997|publisher=Praeger|isbn=978-0275941376}}</ref> The failure of the recovery program was further augmented by civil unrest, rampant graft and corruption within the government, and Marcos's lack of credibility.

Two Americans, namely attorney Richard Hirschfeld and business consultant Robert Chastain, both of whom posed as arms dealers, gained knowledge of a plot by gaining Marcos's trust and secretly tape recorded their conversations with the ousted leader.\n\nAccording to Hirschfeld, he was first invited by Marcos to a party held at the latter's family residence in Oahu, Hawaii. After hearing that one of Hirschfeld's clients was Saudi Sheikh Mohammad Fassi, Marcos's interest was piqued because he had done business with Saudis in the past. A few weeks later, Marcos asked for help with securing a passport from another country, in order to travel back to the Philippines while bypassing travel restrictions imposed by the Philippines and United States governments. This failed, however, and subsequently Marcos asked Hirschfeld to arrange a $10-million loan from Fassi.\n\nOn January 12, 1987, Marcos stated to Hirschfeld that he required another $5-million loan \"in order to pay 10,000 soldiers $500 each as a form of 'combat life insurance.' When asked by Hirschfeld if he was talking about an invasion of the Philippines, Marcos responded, \"Yes.\" Hirschfeld also recalled that the former president said that he was negotiating with several arms dealers to purchase up to $18 million worth of weapons, including tanks and heat-seeking missiles, and enough ammunition to \"last an army three months.\"\n\nMarcos had thought of being flown to his hometown in Ilocos Norte, greeted by his loyal supporters, and initiating a plot to kidnap Corazon Aquino. \u2033What I would like to see happen is we take her hostage,\u2033 Marcos told Chastain. \u2033Not to hurt her ... no reason to hurt her .. to take her.\u2033\n\nLearning of this plan, Hirschfeld contacted the US Department of Justice, and was asked for further evidence. This information eventually reached President Ronald Reagan, who placed Marcos under \"island arrest\", further limiting his movement.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.apnews.com/1b750440d5a491184f5b2a91533774c1|title=Former Philippine President Marcos Reveals Plan to Invade Homeland|work=AP News|accessdate=July 8, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1987-07-10/news/mn-1939_1_president-marcos|title=10,000 Troops, Billions in Gold: House Panel Hears Tapes of Marcos Plotting coup|last=GETLIN |first=JOSH |date=July 10, 1987 |work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=July 8, 2018|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}</ref>\n\nIn response, the Aquino government dismissed Marcos's statements as being a mere propaganda ploy.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1987/07/10/Aquino-government-says-Marcos-invasion-plan-a-propaganda-ploy/2836552888000/|title=Aquino government says Marcos invasion plan a propaganda ploy|work=UPI|accessdate=July 8, 2018|language=en}}</ref>\n\n== Corruption in the Marcos Era ==\n\n===Monopolies===\n[[File:Marcos in Washington 1983.jpg|thumb|Ferdinand Marcos in Washington, 1983]]\nMarcos\u2019 administration spawned new oligarchs in Philippine society who became instant millionaires. These oligarchs plundered government financing institutions to finance their corporate raiding, monopolies and various takeover schemes. Marcos\u2019 cronies were awarded timber, mining and oil concessions and vast tracts of rich government agricultural and urban lands, not to mention lush government construction contracts. During his martial law regime, Marcos confiscated and appropriated by force and duress many businesses and institutions, both private and public, and redistributed them to his [[Marcos Cronies|cronies]] and close personal friends. A presidential crony representing Westington won for its principal the $500 million bid for the construction of the Bataan Nuclear Power Plant in Bagac. The crony's commission was $25 million or $200 million representing five percent of the total bid price. These new oligarchs were known to be insatiable and more profligate than the oligarchs of pre-martial law days.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Testament from a Prison Cell|last=Aquino|first=Ninoy|publisher=Philippine Journal, Incorporated|year=1989|isbn=978-0962169502|location=Los Angeles|pages=}}</ref> Two of Marcos's friends were [[Eduardo Cojuangco Jr.|Eduardo \"Danding\" Cojuangco Jr.]], who would go on to control [[San Miguel Corporation]], and [[Ramon Cojuangco]], late businessman and chairman of [[PLDT]], and father of Antonio \"Tony Boy\" Cojuangco (who would eventually succeed his father in the telecommunications company), both happened to be cousins of [[Corazon Aquino]]. These associates of Marcos then used these as fronts to [[money laundering|launder proceeds]] from institutionalized graft and corruption in the different national governmental agencies as \"[[crony capitalism]]\" for personal benefit. Graft and corruption via bribery, [[racketeering]], and [[embezzlement]] became more prevalent during this era. Marcos also silenced the free press, making the press of the state propaganda the only legal one, which was a common practice for governments around the world that sought to fight communism.\n\nMarcos and his close [[Rolex 12]] associates like [[Juan Ponce Enrile]] used their powers to settle scores against old rivals such as the Lopezes who were always opposed to the Marcos administration. Enrile and the Lopezes ([[Eugenio Lopez Sr.]] and [[Eugenio Lopez Jr.]]) were [[Harvard]]-educated Filipino leaders. Leading opponents such as Senators [[Benigno Aquino Jr.]], [[Jose Diokno]], [[Jovito Salonga]] and many others were imprisoned for months or years. This practice considerably alienated the support of the old social and economic elite and the media, who criticized the Marcos administration endlessly.<ref>For a detailed treatment of corruption under Marcos, see {{cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=amZkAdGTkl4C&pg=PA153|title=Corruption and money laundering: a symbiotic relationship|author1=Chaikin, David|author2=Sharman, Jason Campbell|publisher=Macmillan|year=2009|isbn=978-0-230-61360-7|chapter=The Marcos Kleptocracy}}</ref> The old social and economic elite, all of whom relied on trade and agricultural and industrial exports to the United States such as the families of Enrile, Lopez, Cojuangco, and Aquino, sought a free-market economy. At this point, Marcos controlled both the oligarchy and the oligopoly.\n\n====Establishment of Metro Manila====\nWithout the consent of the people of Manila and environs, Marcos merged four neighboring cities and thirteen municipalities into a Metro Manila. Without the consent of residents of the merged cities and municipalities, he appointed his wife, Imelda Marcos as governor of Metro Manila - the second most powerful office in the republic. Given that Metro Manila accounts for around 20% of the country's population, it is estimated to be responsible for at least 70% of gross national receipts. It is the seat of the national government and some 90% of the national government's offices and instrumentalities are located within its environs. Its budget is second to the national government. In the words of Carlos P. Romulo, Mrs. Marcos was the ''de facto'' Vice President of the Philippines. Because of this, the Marcoses possessed a monopoly of power.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n====Floating Casino in Manila Bay====\nOne of the first acts of Imelda Romualdez Marcos as the Governor of Metro Manila was to legalize gambling to raise revenue for the new metropolis. A floating casino was allowed to operate exclusively inside the Manila Bay. It is owned and operated by \u201cmysterious\u201d stockholders according to the major daily. However, the people of Manila are aware that behind the floating casino management was the brother of Imelda Marcos. One of the most lucrative gambling managements back then was the Jai-Alai, managed by a corporation that received its franchise from the pre-war Commonwealth government. As soon as its franchised expired, a new corporation took over management of Jai-Alai. It was immediately under the control of the First Lady's brother. This new management was allowed to perform operations denied from the former, and it is estimated that the take between the Jai-Alai fronton and the floating casino is Php 2 million a day.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n====Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company (PLDT)====\nReports of the U.S. Senate and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission have described massive million-dollar bribes to officials of the government-backed Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company by the General Telephone and Electric Co. of New York in exchange for supply contracts. The officials of PLDT needed to be investigated for violations of foreign currency regulations and unearned income. However, different stakeholders were kept silent. As one PLDT official boasted \u201can expose will only hurt the Palace.\u201d In the U.S. and Japan, presidents have been driven out of office for similar misconduct.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n====Manila Electric Co. (MERALCO)====\nThe Manila Electric Co. (MERALCO) was one of the largest corporations in the Philippines before the declaration of Martial Law. It was owned and controlled by the Lopez family. After martial law was imposed, it became the prime target for takeover by the Marcos-Romualdez family. Among the first things the clan did was to arrest the eldest son of Eugenio Lopez, Sr., the major stockholder of Meralco for allegedly plotting the assassination of Ferdinand Marcos.\n\nIn the years 1973\u20131974, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) started applying the oil prize squeeze. As a public utility that supplies power needs of the metro, MERALCO was caught in a vicious vise. Its fuel costs started to double, triple, and quadruple but the government refused to allow them to charge higher consumer rates. Within a year, MERALCO was at the brink of bankruptcy. Government financing institutions refused to guarantee MERALCO's foreign loans. As a result, the company was pushed to the edge of massive defaults in loans.\n\nIt was here that the Marcos-Romualdez clan stepped in. According to Eugenio Lopez, Sr., he was promised the release of his eldest son from prison in exchange for the sale of his control in MERALCO to the Marcos-Romualdez group. After several months of negotiations and with the increasing loan defaults, Mr. Lopez conceded defeat. He even died without seeing his son Eugenio, Jr. released from the Marcos martial law prison.\n\nAfter the Marcos-Romualdez takeover, the government allowed MERALCO to increase consumer rates. The government gave huge subsidies to the company. On the fifth anniversary of martial rule, Jesus Bigornia of Bulletin Today wrote that MERALCO rose as one of the top earners. Around Php 200 million in net income was recorded. This was 168% more than the previous year. Aside from being allowed to raise electricity rates, MERALCO was also exempted from paying the duty of oil imports, which is a form of indirect subsidy it should share with poor consumers.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Infrastructure projects ===\nFerdinand Marcos's term was characterized by booming infrastructure,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://martiallawmuseum.ph/magaral/edifice-complex-building-on-the-backs-of-the-filipino-people/|title=Edifice Complex: Building on the Backs of the Filipino People|website=Martial Law Museum|accessdate=February 27, 2019}}</ref> but to the detriment of the economy and of the lives of Filipinos.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rappler.com//views/imho/124682-marcos-economy-golden-age-philippines|title=Marcos years marked 'golden age' of PH economy?

The projected budget for the construction of CCP was P15 million, but by December 1968 the cost had already reached P48 million, and the construction was not even complete yet. Because of this, Imelda Romualdez Marcos loaned $7 million from the National Investment Development Corporation to finance the remaining amount.

In 1974, National Power was already negotiating with General Electric to get the order. However, Westinghouse, another energy company, hired a lobbyist: Herminio Disini, a friend of Ferdinand Marcos. Using his proximity to Marcos, Westinghouse made a direct offer to Marcos and his cabinet to supply a plant with two 620 MW reactors at a base price of $500 million. The estimated total price was raised to around $650 million because of other charges like fuel and transmission lines.<ref name=\":5\" /> Soon after, the negotiations with General Electric were scrapped, and Westinghouse won the deal. By March 1975, Westinghouse's contract price increased to $1.1 billion for interest and escalation costs.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nThere were numerous issues regarding its safety and usability. After the Three Mile Island incident in the United States, construction of the nuclear power plant was stopped. A safety inquiry was done subsequently, which revealed over 4,000 defects.<ref name=\":5\" /> The site chosen for the nuclear plant was also dangerous, as it was built near the open sea, the then-dormant Mount Pinatubo, and was within 25 miles of three geological faults.<ref name=\":5\" /> The nuclear plant was discontinued in 1986 following the Chernobyl disaster.<ref name=\":4\" /> Its goal of generating 620 MW of electricity was never achieved.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2017/ph241/camacho2/|title=The Controversy of the Bataan Nuclear Power Plant|website=large.stanford.edu|accessdate=April 19, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIts cost reached over $2.3 million and was only paid off by the government in April 2017, 31 years after the beginning of its construction. However, government spending for the BNPP continues long after that. Maintaining the plant costs the government P40 million a year. In 2011, the government had to reimburse P4.2 billion to National Power Corporation for the plant's maintenance.

By 1966, the rice variety IR-8 was created. It required intensive irrigation, plenty of fertilizer, and chemical pesticides, but produced substantially higher yields.<ref name=\":14\" />\n\nThis led to the creation of Ferdinand Marcos's major programs, Presidential Decree No. 27, the Masagana 99 agricultural program, which had the goal of producing 99 sacks or 4.4 tons of unmilled rice per hectare to ensure self-sufficiency in food.<ref name=\":15\">{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Kenneth|date=1989|title=PALAY, POLICY, AND PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION: THE \"MASAGANA 99\" PROGRAM REVISITED|url=|journal=Philippine Journal of Public Administration|volume=XXXIII|issue=1|pages=69\u201371|via=}}</ref>\n\nAnnual rice production in the Philippines increased from 3.7 to 7.7 million tons in two decades.The switch to IR8 rice made the Philippines a rice exporter for the first time in the 20th century.<ref name=\":15\" />\n\nAlthough IR8 showed promising results, the years from 1965 to 1986 showed a complete paradox of events. The income per capita rose, the economy was growing, yet people were in famine. The American economist James K.

He was allegedly unable to introduce his agricultural pesticides to the market due to the \"conivance\" between transnational corporations (TNCs) that dominated the production and distribution of chemicals and the Fertilizer and Pesticide Authority (FPA) (Ofreno 1982: 109). In the production of IR8 rice, FPA specified that only certain agricultural pesticides, all of which were German and American pesticide imports, were to be used. Any other pesticide needed to undergo tests at the National Crop Protection Center and at the Bureau of Plant Industry, whose laboratories were headed by German and American specialists. These laboratories were said to have been set up through RP-German Crop Protection Agreement and with the help of the United States Agency for International Development. Therefore, none of Gatan's formulations made it to the FPA recommended pesticides (Ofreno 1982: 109-110).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=BAUTISTA|first=VICTORIA A.|title=Public-Interest Perspective: A Neglected Dimension in the Study of Corruption|date=1983|journal=Philippine Sociological Review|volume=31|issue=3/4|pages=45\u201353|issn=0031-7810|jstor=23898197}}</ref> Probably any other local pesticide which that tried to penetrate the market faced the same fate.\n\n''Land control''\n\nMarcos also allegedly took feudal control of landlords by only covering rice and corn lands to Masagana 99, excluding the vast sugar haciendas of his crony Danding Cojuangco and even Hacienda Luisita in Tarlac.\n\n''Effects of Masagana 99''\n\nAfter the declaration of martial law in 1972, the gap between the rich and the poor became significantly wide. Possible gains from Masagana 99 were either going out of the country or going to the rich alone. Even if rice supply was high and prices were down, people could not afford to buy rice. In a 1979 review of Philippine grain production policy, the World Bank found that total rice consumption in the 1970s slowed, growing at only 2.9%, barely in step with the rate of population increase. Studies by the Food and Nutrition Research Institute found that by 1982, two thirds of families consumed less than the recommended minimum daily calorie intake. 25% of the country's pre-schoolers were stunted, 14% were wasted, and an appalling 69% were underweight. Between 1970 and 1983, infant mortality was at 59 per 1,000 in rural areas and 55 per 1,000 in urban areas \u2013 among the highest in East and Southeast Asia. The cause of infant and child deaths could be directly traced to hunger and a lack of basic health care services.<ref name=\"Marcos' Green Revolution\"/>\n\n===Overseas investments and bank accounts===\nThe overseas properties of Marcos and his associates created an empire spanning places as diverse as California, Washington, New York, Rome, Vienna, Australia, Antilles, the Netherlands, Hong Kong, &nbsp;Switzerland and Singapore.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite book|title=Some are smarter than others : the history of Marcos' crony capitalism|last=Manapat, Ricardo|date=1991|publisher=Aletheia Publications|isbn=978-9719128700|oclc=28428684}}</ref> The more popular properties among those in this empire are the multi-million dollar New York real estate investments, California banks and Swiss bank accounts; lesser known ones are villas in Austria, London, and Rome,&nbsp;gold and diamond investments in South Africa, and banks and hotels in Israel.\n\nThere were ten prominent Filipinos, led by Ferdinand Marcos and Imelda Marcos, who acquired, presumably illegally, various extensive properties in the U.S. They were Roberto Benedicto, Antonio Floirendo, Juan Ponce Enrile, Jose Yao Campos, Eduardo Cojuangco, Roman Cruz, Jr., Geronimo Velasco, and Rodolfo Cuenca.<ref name=\":11\">{{Cite book|title=The transnational dynamics of the Marcos Plunder|last=Aquino, Belinda A.|date=1999|publisher=University of the Philippines, National College of Public Administration and Governance|isbn=978-9718567197|oclc=760665486}}</ref> Other nominees who were noted as having been crucial in considerable overseas transactions were Ricardo Silverio, Herminio Disini, Nemesio Yabi and Edna Camam.<ref name=\":11\"/> Dewey Dee, one of Marcos\u2019 main nominees, as well as Jose Yao Campos would later reveal how they fronted Marcos\u2019 investments both locally and abroad via at least twenty five interlocking corporations set up for this purpose.\n\nThe main way the Marcoses were able to get money abroad was via the laundering of dirty money. Contrary to images commonly conjured by the word \"dirty\", dirty money, as defined by Jean Ziegler, who wrote extensively about the faults of the Swiss banking system, is simply \"capital whose transfer does not relate to any repayment of debt or trading transaction.\" The notion that dirty money is money which was stolen via ''dirty'' means has been used by various officials to excuse the unreasonable transfer of capital abroad, defending themselves through trite legalisms and the urgency of preserving money amidst local hyperinflation and political instability, as well as to completely deny its existence.<ref name=\":7\" /> &nbsp;Estelito Mendoza, Marcos\u2019 Solicitor General, is quoted in Ricardo&nbsp;Manapat's book ''Some Are Smarter than Others: The History of Marcos' Crony Capitalism'' as defining dirty money as money whose \"value moves merely in one direction without any equal compensatory movement in the other.\"<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nThe process by which Marcos laundered dirty money abroad was very comprehensive and difficult to track. First, overseas bank accounts were established in order to have easy access to the funds without concern for Philippine exchange laws. Often, cronies would choose distinguished U.S. law firms which specialized in offshore real investment in U.S. jurisdictions.<ref name=\":11\"/> Then, a lawyer or accountant would be contacted to establish an offshore corporation, usually in Hong Kong, to serve as the managing director of the corporation. A \"shell\" company, organized solely for the purpose of moving and hiding the true ownership of assets served as a channel for transferring funds from the Philippines inconspicuously.<ref name=\":11\"/><ref name=\":7\" /> As this happened, another lawyers, often in the U.S., would be hired for a fee of S200 to S3,000 to arrange for the incorporation of another offshore corporation through accounting firms in Cura\u00e7ao in the Netherlands Antilles.<ref name=\":11\"/> This would become the significant link between the real estate investment and the client. By this point, it would be more and more convoluted, becoming in the process much more difficult to track. One San Francisco lawyer, who represented affluent Filipino investors in California land deals, said \"You\u2019ll never find out who the principals are. Every time I have ever dealt with these guys, I have never dealt with a document signed by a principal.\" The Marcos group used this very complicated and developed \"laundering\" process of involving multiple layers of dummy corporations scattered internationally to acquire and establish several multimillion assets in various U.S. locations.<ref name=\":11\"/>\n\nMarcos, through different international banks, was able to launder money abroad. Crocker National Bank in San Francisco, for example, had to settle with the US Treasury Department, because they failed to report $4 billion in cash deposits from 1980 to 1984 from six Hong Kong-based banks.<ref name=\":7\" /> Hong Kong was a favorite among Filipino launderers. Due to the absence of foreign exchange controls in Hong Kong, it was impossible to determine the origin of the money.\n\nCrocker merely stated that the money came from \"various Asian countries.\"<ref name=\":7\" /> The compliance of private banks with anonymous individuals looking to deposit their money enabled money laundering. Consequently, money laundering is an integral part of private banking. Marcos would later go on to seek the help of other private banks in Switzerland, Hong Kong, Austria, Panama, Liechtenstein, and the Netherland Antilles. The Swiss are known for their mastery in money laundering thanks to the central role of secrecy in their society.<ref name=\":7\" /> Austria, which also has its own tradition of banking secrecy, allowed accounts to be opened without the client ever revealing his or her name, something Swiss banks did not even allow.<ref name=\":7\" /> Hong Kong, more conveniently located for the Philippines, has developed facilities for the movement of money and the ready availability of various British lawyers who offer services of opening front or [[shell corporation]]s for a fee. Panama is noted for its corrupt politicians and convenient transit point to the U.S.<ref name=\":7\" /> The Netherland Antilles served as the home for more than 35,000 shell companies of Marcos in order to invest anonymously in overseas financial markets and U.S. real estates.<ref name=\":7\" /> Throughout the entire process, highly-paid lawyers, accountants, investment consultants and portfolio managers were hired in order to organize shell corporations and acquire overseas properties.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nThe Marcoses invested a lot in the US East and West coasts, but there were also important investments in Texas and Washington state.<ref name=\":7\" /> Most of the major real estate investments were Imelda's purchases of real estate in New York, Jose Campos Yao's investments in Texas and Seattle, and crony purchases in California.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nJose Campos Yao, a Marcos ally and crony, along with his associates, purchased a whole city block in Seattle, Washington in 1983.

She elicited the help of key individuals such as Gliceria Tantoco, one of Imelda's closest friends and business associates, Antonio Floirendo, who was instrumental in Imelda's involvement in the lucrative sugar trading business in New York and the purchase of the Olympic Towers, Rolando Gapud, one of Marcos\u2019 financial advisers, Fe Roa Gimenez and Vilma H. Bautista, personal assistants of Imelda, and Joseph and Ralph Bernstein, who played key roles in helping the Marcoses purchase and conceal ownership of their Manhattan properties.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nImelda Marcos purchased five expensive Manhattan condominiums at the Olympic Towers, located on 5th Avenue, New York.<ref name=\":7\" /> The first three condominiums were purchased by Thetaventure Ltd., a Hong Kong-based shell corporation, for a total of $688,000 and was remodelled for $3.75 million. The fourth and fifth condominium were bought for $270,000 and $1.1 million respectively. Imelda also purchased her own resort, the Lindenmere Estate in Center Moriches, Suffolk County, Long Island. It was estimated to be between $19 to $20 million after renovations were done. The restorations was paid for by Vilma Bautista, Imelda's personal assistant and Luna 7 Development Corp., a corporation registered in New York.<ref name=\":7\" /> The Townhouse at 13-15 East 66th, New York City, is quite a different case from the other properties, because it was not purchased by a shell corporation but by the Philippine Consulate and the Philippine National Bank. The sixth floor of the townhouse was converted into a private disco where the guests can have fun and play with giant pillows. It also housed the expensive art Imelda collected over the years.<ref name=\":7\" /> Imelda would also purchase Herald Center, a shopping center worth $70 million, 200 Madison, an office building acquired for $50 million, Crown Building, a large edifice located at 730 Fifth Avenue bought for $51 million through Lasutra Corp.

The Center for Research and Communications, a Philippine private think-tank, estimated that Marcos and his cronies took away not only $10 million but $30 billion since the 1950s.<ref name=\":11\"/>\n\n=== The US-Marcos Relationship ===\n[[File:The Marcoses and the Johnsons dancing.jpg|thumb|Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos with the Johnsons in 1966]]\n[[File:Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos with the Nixons.jpg|thumb|Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos with the Nixons in 1969]]\nAll five American presidents from 1965 to 1985 were unwilling to jeopardize the US-Marcos relationship mainly to protect and retain access of the US military bases in the Philippines. However, at the same time, for the US, the Philippines was just one of its many allies, and for the Philippines, the US was its only patron. Therefore, Marcos ensured to identify himself closely to the US in order to secure a strong bargaining power with their government. Indeed, he had manipulated this American connection to sustain him during his two decades of power. US support was believed to be the only reason why Marcos remained in power.<ref name=\":10\">{{cite journal|last=Kessler|first=Richard J.|date=1986|title=Marcos and the Americans|journal=Foreign Policy|issue=63|pages=40\u201357|doi=10.2307/1148755|issn=0015-7228|jstor=1148755}}</ref>\n[[File:Marcos visit Reagan 1982.jpg|thumb|Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos meet with President Reagan in 1982]]\nOver his term, Marcos was able to strengthen his ties to the US government. Johnson received two engineer battalions bought with the Philippine's American aid as a form of Philippines military participation in the Vietnam War. After the fall of South Vietnam, Gerald Ford demanded better security assistance from allies, such as the Philippines. While Carter wanted to retain the US military bases in the Philippines to project military power in the Indian Ocean to guard West's oil supply line from the Middle East.<ref name=\":10\" /> All of which, Marcos granted.\n\n==== Obtaining additional aid ====\nTo obtain additional aid, Marcos often leveraged on threats that caught the attention of the US government. To secure additional aid for his campaign, Marcos threatened to search every visiting American naval vessel. The US responded by assisting his campaign indirectly, injecting several million dollars into the government banking system.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Leifer|first=Michael|last2=Thompson|first2=W.

Yet he received warnings from the Philippine embassy in Washington that \u201cprovisions should now be made in anticipation of a possible phasing out or minimization of U.S. aid to the Republic of the Philippines, both for military aid and non-military items, considering the evolving temper of the American Congress.\u201d Afraid, Marcos began to suggests threats again. In one of his presidential speeches, he stated that the bases were a threat to regional peace and security, while reminding the United States of its \"solemn obligation\" to continue aid. He warned that the bases could \"imperil more than they serve our interests.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Presidential Speeches|last=|first=|year=1979|isbn=|location=Manila|pages=275\u2013277|chapter=Speech by Ferdinand E.

In less than 20 days however, the Sandiganbayan listed Imelda's \u201cadvanced age\u201d and health condition as considerations for allowing the accused to post bail. The Fifth Division's (of the Sandiganbayan) ruling read that \u201cthe fact that she is of advanced age and for health reasons, consistent with the doctrine in Enrile vs Sandiganbayan, bail is allowed for these seven cases.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2018/12/04/1874021/sandiganbayan-defends-grant-bail-imelda-marcos|title=Sandiganbayan defends grant of bail to Imelda Marcos|website=philstar.com|accessdate=April 19, 2019}}</ref> The Supreme Court of the Philippines affirms that the Marcoses\u2019 assets, that are beyond the legal and declared government salaries, are considered as ill-gotten wealth. In 1998 however, the Supreme Court acquitted Imelda Marcos of corruption charges from a previous graft conviction in 1993.\n\nSome US Court of Appeals of the Ninth Circuit confirmed a contempt judgement in relation to the assets of Imelda and her son Bongbong in the United States. Although on a different subject matter, this judgement awarded $353.6 million to human rights victims, which was arguably the largest contempt award ever affirmed by an appellate court.\n\n=== Illegal Swiss foundations ===\nIn 1986, following the overthrow of the Marcos regime, it was discovered that as early as 1968, Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos, under the pseudonyms William Saunders and Jane Ryan, opened four bank accounts in Swiss banks amounting to nearly $1 million.<ref name=\":11\"/> Ferdinand Marcos\u2019 salary then was only 60,000 pesos a year.<ref name=\":11\" /> Imelda Marcos, on the other hand, did not have any visible means of income.

In December 1997 (Reuters 1997:3), Switzerland's highest court ordered the Swiss banks to return $500 million of Marcos\u2019 secret accounts to the Philippine government, marking a major step forward in efforts to recover the Marcos\u2019 hidden wealth.<ref name=\":11\" /> That same year, the Philippine Senate, through its Blue Ribbon Committee chairman Franklin Drilon, has revealed the existence of 97 alleged accounts of Ferdinand Marcos in 23 banks in Europe, the United States, and Asia, suspected to be depositories of wealth looted from the Philippine treasury. Thirteen of the 23 banks mentioned by Drilon are in Switzerland, namely: Swiss Credit Bank, Swiss Bank Corp., Bankers Trust AG, Banque Paribas, Affida Bank, Copla, S.A., Lombard Odier et Cie, Standard Chartered Bank, Swiss Volkabank, Bank Ricklin, Compaigne Banque Et d\u2019Investissements, Compaigne de Gestion Et De Banque Gonet Sa Nyon, and Bank Hoffman AG.<ref name=\":11\" />\n\nThe Sandiganbayan 5th Division has recently convicted Imelda Marcos of seven counts of graft for creating and maintaining private foundations in Switzerland, violating the anti-graft law that prohibits public officials from having pecuniary interests in private businesses.<ref name=\":13\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.rappler.com//nation/216333-imelda-marcos-guilty-verdict-graft-case-shows-scheme-earnings-swiss-foundations|title=Imelda Marcos verdict shows scheme to earn $200M from Swiss foundations|last=Buan|first=Lian|website=Rappler|language=en|accessdate=April 19, 2019}}</ref> As the Sandiganbayan's decision reads, \u201cThough named as a foundation, the evidence shows that these entities were put up primarily for the entrepreneurial activity of opening bank accounts and deposits, transferring funds, earning interests and even profit from investment, for the private benefit of the Marcos family as beneficiaries\u201d.

This was taking place at the same time that China was beginning to accept free-market capitalism and American businesses were jockeying to establish manufacturing plants in China. The political troubles of the Philippines hindered the entry of foreign investments, and foreign banks stopped granting loans to the Philippine government.\n\nIn an attempt to launch a national economic recovery program and despite his growing isolation from American businesses, Marcos negotiated with foreign creditors including the [[International Bank for Reconstruction and Development]], [[World Bank]], and the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), for a restructuring of the country's foreign debts \u2013 to give the Philippines more time to pay the loans. Marcos ordered a cut in government expenditures and used a portion of the savings to finance the ''Sariling Sikap'' (Self-Reliance), a livelihood program he established in 1984.\n\nHowever, the economy continued to shrink despite the government's recovery efforts due to a number of reasons. Most of the so-called government development programs failed to materialize. Government funds were often siphoned off by Marcos or his cronies. American investors were discouraged by the Filipino economic elite who were against the corruption that by now had become endemic in the Marcos regime.<ref name=\"albert\">{{cite book|last1=Celoza|first1=Albert|title=Ferdinand Marcos and the Philippines: The Political Economy of Authoritarianism|date=November 25, 1997|publisher=Praeger|isbn=978-0275941376}}</ref> The failure of the recovery program was further augmented by civil unrest, rampant graft and corruption within the government, and Marcos's lack of credibility.

Two Americans, namely attorney Richard Hirschfeld and business consultant Robert Chastain, both of whom posed as arms dealers, gained knowledge of a plot by gaining Marcos's trust and secretly tape recorded their conversations with the ousted leader.\n\nAccording to Hirschfeld, he was first invited by Marcos to a party held at the latter's family residence in Oahu, Hawaii. After hearing that one of Hirschfeld's clients was Saudi Sheikh Mohammad Fassi, Marcos's interest was piqued because he had done business with Saudis in the past. A few weeks later, Marcos asked for help with securing a passport from another country, in order to travel back to the Philippines while bypassing travel restrictions imposed by the Philippines and United States governments. This failed, however, and subsequently Marcos asked Hirschfeld to arrange a $10-million loan from Fassi.\n\nOn January 12, 1987, Marcos stated to Hirschfeld that he required another $5-million loan \"in order to pay 10,000 soldiers $500 each as a form of 'combat life insurance.' When asked by Hirschfeld if he was talking about an invasion of the Philippines, Marcos responded, \"Yes.\" Hirschfeld also recalled that the former president said that he was negotiating with several arms dealers to purchase up to $18 million worth of weapons, including tanks and heat-seeking missiles, and enough ammunition to \"last an army three months.\"\n\nMarcos had thought of being flown to his hometown in Ilocos Norte, greeted by his loyal supporters, and initiating a plot to kidnap Corazon Aquino. \u2033What I would like to see happen is we take her hostage,\u2033 Marcos told Chastain. \u2033Not to hurt her ... no reason to hurt her .. to take her.\u2033\n\nLearning of this plan, Hirschfeld contacted the US Department of Justice, and was asked for further evidence.

This practice considerably alienated the support of the old social and economic elite and the media, who criticized the Marcos administration endlessly.<ref>For a detailed treatment of corruption under Marcos, see {{cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=amZkAdGTkl4C&pg=PA153|title=Corruption and money laundering: a symbiotic relationship|author1=Chaikin, David|author2=Sharman, Jason Campbell|publisher=Macmillan|year=2009|isbn=978-0-230-61360-7|chapter=The Marcos Kleptocracy}}</ref> The old social and economic elite, all of whom relied on trade and agricultural and industrial exports to the United States such as the families of Enrile, Lopez, Cojuangco, and Aquino, sought a free-market economy. At this point, Marcos controlled both the oligarchy and the oligopoly.\n\n====Establishment of Metro Manila====\nWithout the consent of the people of Manila and environs, Marcos merged four neighboring cities and thirteen municipalities into a Metro Manila. Without the consent of residents of the merged cities and municipalities, he appointed his wife, Imelda Marcos as governor of Metro Manila - the second most powerful office in the republic. Given that Metro Manila accounts for around 20% of the country's population, it is estimated to be responsible for at least 70% of gross national receipts. It is the seat of the national government and some 90% of the national government's offices and instrumentalities are located within its environs. Its budget is second to the national government. In the words of Carlos P. Romulo, Mrs. Marcos was the ''de facto'' Vice President of the Philippines. Because of this, the Marcoses possessed a monopoly of power.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n====Floating Casino in Manila Bay====\nOne of the first acts of Imelda Romualdez Marcos as the Governor of Metro Manila was to legalize gambling to raise revenue for the new metropolis. A floating casino was allowed to operate exclusively inside the Manila Bay. It is owned and operated by \u201cmysterious\u201d stockholders according to the major daily. However, the people of Manila are aware that behind the floating casino management was the brother of Imelda Marcos. One of the most lucrative gambling managements back then was the Jai-Alai, managed by a corporation that received its franchise from the pre-war Commonwealth government. As soon as its franchised expired, a new corporation took over management of Jai-Alai. It was immediately under the control of the First Lady's brother. This new management was allowed to perform operations denied from the former, and it is estimated that the take between the Jai-Alai fronton and the floating casino is Php 2 million a day.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n====Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company (PLDT)====\nReports of the U.S. Senate and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission have described massive million-dollar bribes to officials of the government-backed Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company by the General Telephone and Electric Co. of New York in exchange for supply contracts. The officials of PLDT needed to be investigated for violations of foreign currency regulations and unearned income. However, different stakeholders were kept silent. As one PLDT official boasted \u201can expose will only hurt the Palace.\u201d In the U.S. and Japan, presidents have been driven out of office for similar misconduct.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n====Manila Electric Co. (MERALCO)====\nThe Manila Electric Co. (MERALCO) was one of the largest corporations in the Philippines before the declaration of Martial Law. It was owned and controlled by the Lopez family. After martial law was imposed, it became the prime target for takeover by the Marcos-Romualdez family. Among the first things the clan did was to arrest the eldest son of Eugenio Lopez, Sr., the major stockholder of Meralco for allegedly plotting the assassination of Ferdinand Marcos.\n\nIn the years 1973\u20131974, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) started applying the oil prize squeeze. As a public utility that supplies power needs of the metro, MERALCO was caught in a vicious vise. Its fuel costs started to double, triple, and quadruple but the government refused to allow them to charge higher consumer rates. Within a year, MERALCO was at the brink of bankruptcy. Government financing institutions refused to guarantee MERALCO's foreign loans. As a result, the company was pushed to the edge of massive defaults in loans.\n\nIt was here that the Marcos-Romualdez clan stepped in. According to Eugenio Lopez, Sr., he was promised the release of his eldest son from prison in exchange for the sale of his control in MERALCO to the Marcos-Romualdez group. After several months of negotiations and with the increasing loan defaults, Mr. Lopez conceded defeat. He even died without seeing his son Eugenio, Jr. released from the Marcos martial law prison.\n\nAfter the Marcos-Romualdez takeover, the government allowed MERALCO to increase consumer rates. The government gave huge subsidies to the company. On the fifth anniversary of martial rule, Jesus Bigornia of Bulletin Today wrote that MERALCO rose as one of the top earners. Around Php 200 million in net income was recorded. This was 168% more than the previous year. Aside from being allowed to raise electricity rates, MERALCO was also exempted from paying the duty of oil imports, which is a form of indirect subsidy it should share with poor consumers.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Infrastructure projects ===\nFerdinand Marcos's term was characterized by booming infrastructure,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://martiallawmuseum.ph/magaral/edifice-complex-building-on-the-backs-of-the-filipino-people/|title=Edifice Complex: Building on the Backs of the Filipino People|website=Martial Law Museum|accessdate=February 27, 2019}}</ref> but to the detriment of the economy and of the lives of Filipinos.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rappler.com//views/imho/124682-marcos-economy-golden-age-philippines|title=Marcos years marked 'golden age' of PH economy?

The projected budget for the construction of CCP was P15 million, but by December 1968 the cost had already reached P48 million, and the construction was not even complete yet. Because of this, Imelda Romualdez Marcos loaned $7 million from the National Investment Development Corporation to finance the remaining amount.

In 1974, National Power was already negotiating with General Electric to get the order. However, Westinghouse, another energy company, hired a lobbyist: Herminio Disini, a friend of Ferdinand Marcos. Using his proximity to Marcos, Westinghouse made a direct offer to Marcos and his cabinet to supply a plant with two 620 MW reactors at a base price of $500 million. The estimated total price was raised to around $650 million because of other charges like fuel and transmission lines.<ref name=\":5\" /> Soon after, the negotiations with General Electric were scrapped, and Westinghouse won the deal. By March 1975, Westinghouse's contract price increased to $1.1 billion for interest and escalation costs.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nThere were numerous issues regarding its safety and usability. After the Three Mile Island incident in the United States, construction of the nuclear power plant was stopped. A safety inquiry was done subsequently, which revealed over 4,000 defects.<ref name=\":5\" /> The site chosen for the nuclear plant was also dangerous, as it was built near the open sea, the then-dormant Mount Pinatubo, and was within 25 miles of three geological faults.<ref name=\":5\" /> The nuclear plant was discontinued in 1986 following the Chernobyl disaster.<ref name=\":4\" /> Its goal of generating 620 MW of electricity was never achieved.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2017/ph241/camacho2/|title=The Controversy of the Bataan Nuclear Power Plant|website=large.stanford.edu|accessdate=April 19, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIts cost reached over $2.3 million and was only paid off by the government in April 2017, 31 years after the beginning of its construction. However, government spending for the BNPP continues long after that. Maintaining the plant costs the government P40 million a year. In 2011, the government had to reimburse P4.2 billion to National Power Corporation for the plant's maintenance. To contribute to the cost of its maintenance, it was transformed into a tourist attraction.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n==== San Juanico Bridge ====\n[[File:San Juanico Bridge.jpg|thumb|San Juanico Bridge connecting Leyte and Samar]]\nThe San Juanico Bridge is part of the Pan-Philippine Highway and links the provinces of Leyte and Samar through Tacloban City and Santa Rita, Samar.

There was not enough traffic between these two islands to warrant a bridge to be constructed there. It is for this reason that the San Juanico Bridge remains to be the one of the costliest white elephant projects during the Marcos era.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n=== Marcos's Green Revolution ===\nThe Green Revolution is a set of research technology transfer initiatives from the 1950s to 1960s that increased agricultural production worldwide, particularly in developing countries such as the Philippines.<ref name=\":14\">{{Citation|last=Wu|first=Felicia|title=The Green Revolution|date=2004|work=The Future of Genetically Modified Crops|pages=11\u201338|series=Lessons from the Green Revolution|edition=1|publisher=RAND Corporation|isbn=9780833036469|last2=P.Butz|first2=William|jstor=10.7249/mg161rc.11}}</ref>\n\nWith the support of the Rockefeller and Ford Foundations, the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) was established in the Philippines. By 1966, the rice variety IR-8 was created. It required intensive irrigation, plenty of fertilizer, and chemical pesticides, but produced substantially higher yields.<ref name=\":14\" />\n\nThis led to the creation of Ferdinand Marcos's major programs, Presidential Decree No. 27, the Masagana 99 agricultural program, which had the goal of producing 99 sacks or 4.4 tons of unmilled rice per hectare to ensure self-sufficiency in food.<ref name=\":15\">{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Kenneth|date=1989|title=PALAY, POLICY, AND PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION: THE \"MASAGANA 99\" PROGRAM REVISITED|url=|journal=Philippine Journal of Public Administration|volume=XXXIII|issue=1|pages=69\u201371|via=}}</ref>\n\nAnnual rice production in the Philippines increased from 3.7 to 7.7 million tons in two decades.The switch to IR8 rice made the Philippines a rice exporter for the first time in the 20th century.<ref name=\":15\" />\n\nAlthough IR8 showed promising results, the years from 1965 to 1986 showed a complete paradox of events. The income per capita rose, the economy was growing, yet people were in famine. The American economist James K. Boyce calls this phenomenon \u201cimmiserizing growth\u201d, when economic growth, and political and social conditions, are such that the rich get absolutely richer and the poor become absolutely poorer.<ref name=\"Marcos' Green Revolution\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.manilatimes.net/marcos-green-revolution/246377/|title=Marcos' Green Revolution|date=February 22, 2016|website=The Manila Times Online|language=en|accessdate=April 19, 2019}}</ref>\n\n''Gonzalo Gatan's Pesticide case''\n\nOne of the possible causes to this was the case reported by Gonzalo Gatan of the Manila Pest Control Company against the key implementors of Masagana 99. He was allegedly unable to introduce his agricultural pesticides to the market due to the \"conivance\" between transnational corporations (TNCs) that dominated the production and distribution of chemicals and the Fertilizer and Pesticide Authority (FPA) (Ofreno 1982: 109). In the production of IR8 rice, FPA specified that only certain agricultural pesticides, all of which were German and American pesticide imports, were to be used. Any other pesticide needed to undergo tests at the National Crop Protection Center and at the Bureau of Plant Industry, whose laboratories were headed by German and American specialists. These laboratories were said to have been set up through RP-German Crop Protection Agreement and with the help of the United States Agency for International Development. Therefore, none of Gatan's formulations made it to the FPA recommended pesticides (Ofreno 1982: 109-110).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=BAUTISTA|first=VICTORIA A.|title=Public-Interest Perspective: A Neglected Dimension in the Study of Corruption|date=1983|journal=Philippine Sociological Review|volume=31|issue=3/4|pages=45\u201353|issn=0031-7810|jstor=23898197}}</ref> Probably any other local pesticide which that tried to penetrate the market faced the same fate.\n\n''Land control''\n\nMarcos also allegedly took feudal control of landlords by only covering rice and corn lands to Masagana 99, excluding the vast sugar haciendas of his crony Danding Cojuangco and even Hacienda Luisita in Tarlac.\n\n''Effects of Masagana 99''\n\nAfter the declaration of martial law in 1972, the gap between the rich and the poor became significantly wide. Possible gains from Masagana 99 were either going out of the country or going to the rich alone. Even if rice supply was high and prices were down, people could not afford to buy rice. In a 1979 review of Philippine grain production policy, the World Bank found that total rice consumption in the 1970s slowed, growing at only 2.9%, barely in step with the rate of population increase. Studies by the Food and Nutrition Research Institute found that by 1982, two thirds of families consumed less than the recommended minimum daily calorie intake. 25% of the country's pre-schoolers were stunted, 14% were wasted, and an appalling 69% were underweight. Between 1970 and 1983, infant mortality was at 59 per 1,000 in rural areas and 55 per 1,000 in urban areas \u2013 among the highest in East and Southeast Asia. The cause of infant and child deaths could be directly traced to hunger and a lack of basic health care services.<ref name=\"Marcos' Green Revolution\"/>\n\n===Overseas investments and bank accounts===\nThe overseas properties of Marcos and his associates created an empire spanning places as diverse as California, Washington, New York, Rome, Vienna, Australia, Antilles, the Netherlands, Hong Kong, &nbsp;Switzerland and Singapore.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite book|title=Some are smarter than others : the history of Marcos' crony capitalism|last=Manapat, Ricardo|date=1991|publisher=Aletheia Publications|isbn=978-9719128700|oclc=28428684}}</ref> The more popular properties among those in this empire are the multi-million dollar New York real estate investments, California banks and Swiss bank accounts; lesser known ones are villas in Austria, London, and Rome,&nbsp;gold and diamond investments in South Africa, and banks and hotels in Israel.\n\nThere were ten prominent Filipinos, led by Ferdinand Marcos and Imelda Marcos, who acquired, presumably illegally, various extensive properties in the U.S. They were Roberto Benedicto, Antonio Floirendo, Juan Ponce Enrile, Jose Yao Campos, Eduardo Cojuangco, Roman Cruz, Jr., Geronimo Velasco, and Rodolfo Cuenca.<ref name=\":11\">{{Cite book|title=The transnational dynamics of the Marcos Plunder|last=Aquino, Belinda A.|date=1999|publisher=University of the Philippines, National College of Public Administration and Governance|isbn=978-9718567197|oclc=760665486}}</ref> Other nominees who were noted as having been crucial in considerable overseas transactions were Ricardo Silverio, Herminio Disini, Nemesio Yabi and Edna Camam.<ref name=\":11\"/> Dewey Dee, one of Marcos\u2019 main nominees, as well as Jose Yao Campos would later reveal how they fronted Marcos\u2019 investments both locally and abroad via at least twenty five interlocking corporations set up for this purpose.\n\nThe main way the Marcoses were able to get money abroad was via the laundering of dirty money. Contrary to images commonly conjured by the word \"dirty\", dirty money, as defined by Jean Ziegler, who wrote extensively about the faults of the Swiss banking system, is simply \"capital whose transfer does not relate to any repayment of debt or trading transaction.\" The notion that dirty money is money which was stolen via ''dirty'' means has been used by various officials to excuse the unreasonable transfer of capital abroad, defending themselves through trite legalisms and the urgency of preserving money amidst local hyperinflation and political instability, as well as to completely deny its existence.<ref name=\":7\" /> &nbsp;Estelito Mendoza, Marcos\u2019 Solicitor General, is quoted in Ricardo&nbsp;Manapat's book ''Some Are Smarter than Others: The History of Marcos' Crony Capitalism'' as defining dirty money as money whose \"value moves merely in one direction without any equal compensatory movement in the other.\"<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nThe process by which Marcos laundered dirty money abroad was very comprehensive and difficult to track. First, overseas bank accounts were established in order to have easy access to the funds without concern for Philippine exchange laws. Often, cronies would choose distinguished U.S. law firms which specialized in offshore real investment in U.S. jurisdictions.<ref name=\":11\"/> Then, a lawyer or accountant would be contacted to establish an offshore corporation, usually in Hong Kong, to serve as the managing director of the corporation. A \"shell\" company, organized solely for the purpose of moving and hiding the true ownership of assets served as a channel for transferring funds from the Philippines inconspicuously.<ref name=\":11\"/><ref name=\":7\" /> As this happened, another lawyers, often in the U.S., would be hired for a fee of S200 to S3,000 to arrange for the incorporation of another offshore corporation through accounting firms in Cura\u00e7ao in the Netherlands Antilles.<ref name=\":11\"/> This would become the significant link between the real estate investment and the client. By this point, it would be more and more convoluted, becoming in the process much more difficult to track. One San Francisco lawyer, who represented affluent Filipino investors in California land deals, said \"You\u2019ll never find out who the principals are. Every time I have ever dealt with these guys, I have never dealt with a document signed by a principal.\" The Marcos group used this very complicated and developed \"laundering\" process of involving multiple layers of dummy corporations scattered internationally to acquire and establish several multimillion assets in various U.S. locations.<ref name=\":11\"/>\n\nMarcos, through different international banks, was able to launder money abroad. Crocker National Bank in San Francisco, for example, had to settle with the US Treasury Department, because they failed to report $4 billion in cash deposits from 1980 to 1984 from six Hong Kong-based banks.<ref name=\":7\" /> Hong Kong was a favorite among Filipino launderers. Due to the absence of foreign exchange controls in Hong Kong, it was impossible to determine the origin of the money.\n\nCrocker merely stated that the money came from \"various Asian countries.\"<ref name=\":7\" /> The compliance of private banks with anonymous individuals looking to deposit their money enabled money laundering. Consequently, money laundering is an integral part of private banking. Marcos would later go on to seek the help of other private banks in Switzerland, Hong Kong, Austria, Panama, Liechtenstein, and the Netherland Antilles. The Swiss are known for their mastery in money laundering thanks to the central role of secrecy in their society.<ref name=\":7\" /> Austria, which also has its own tradition of banking secrecy, allowed accounts to be opened without the client ever revealing his or her name, something Swiss banks did not even allow.<ref name=\":7\" /> Hong Kong, more conveniently located for the Philippines, has developed facilities for the movement of money and the ready availability of various British lawyers who offer services of opening front or [[shell corporation]]s for a fee. Panama is noted for its corrupt politicians and convenient transit point to the U.S.<ref name=\":7\" /> The Netherland Antilles served as the home for more than 35,000 shell companies of Marcos in order to invest anonymously in overseas financial markets and U.S. real estates.<ref name=\":7\" /> Throughout the entire process, highly-paid lawyers, accountants, investment consultants and portfolio managers were hired in order to organize shell corporations and acquire overseas properties.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nThe Marcoses invested a lot in the US East and West coasts, but there were also important investments in Texas and Washington state.<ref name=\":7\" /> Most of the major real estate investments were Imelda's purchases of real estate in New York, Jose Campos Yao's investments in Texas and Seattle, and crony purchases in California.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nJose Campos Yao, a Marcos ally and crony, along with his associates, purchased a whole city block in Seattle, Washington in 1983.

She elicited the help of key individuals such as Gliceria Tantoco, one of Imelda's closest friends and business associates, Antonio Floirendo, who was instrumental in Imelda's involvement in the lucrative sugar trading business in New York and the purchase of the Olympic Towers, Rolando Gapud, one of Marcos\u2019 financial advisers, Fe Roa Gimenez and Vilma H. Bautista, personal assistants of Imelda, and Joseph and Ralph Bernstein, who played key roles in helping the Marcoses purchase and conceal ownership of their Manhattan properties.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nImelda Marcos purchased five expensive Manhattan condominiums at the Olympic Towers, located on 5th Avenue, New York.<ref name=\":7\" /> The first three condominiums were purchased by Thetaventure Ltd., a Hong Kong-based shell corporation, for a total of $688,000 and was remodelled for $3.75 million. The fourth and fifth condominium were bought for $270,000 and $1.1 million respectively. Imelda also purchased her own resort, the Lindenmere Estate in Center Moriches, Suffolk County, Long Island.

However, at the same time, for the US, the Philippines was just one of its many allies, and for the Philippines, the US was its only patron. Therefore, Marcos ensured to identify himself closely to the US in order to secure a strong bargaining power with their government. Indeed, he had manipulated this American connection to sustain him during his two decades of power. US support was believed to be the only reason why Marcos remained in power.<ref name=\":10\">{{cite journal|last=Kessler|first=Richard J.|date=1986|title=Marcos and the Americans|journal=Foreign Policy|issue=63|pages=40\u201357|doi=10.2307/1148755|issn=0015-7228|jstor=1148755}}</ref>\n[[File:Marcos visit Reagan 1982.jpg|thumb|Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos meet with President Reagan in 1982]]\nOver his term, Marcos was able to strengthen his ties to the US government. Johnson received two engineer battalions bought with the Philippine's American aid as a form of Philippines military participation in the Vietnam War. After the fall of South Vietnam, Gerald Ford demanded better security assistance from allies, such as the Philippines. While Carter wanted to retain the US military bases in the Philippines to project military power in the Indian Ocean to guard West's oil supply line from the Middle East.<ref name=\":10\" /> All of which, Marcos granted.\n\n==== Obtaining additional aid ====\nTo obtain additional aid, Marcos often leveraged on threats that caught the attention of the US government. To secure additional aid for his campaign, Marcos threatened to search every visiting American naval vessel. The US responded by assisting his campaign indirectly, injecting several million dollars into the government banking system.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Leifer|first=Michael|last2=Thompson|first2=W.

Yet he received warnings from the Philippine embassy in Washington that \u201cprovisions should now be made in anticipation of a possible phasing out or minimization of U.S. aid to the Republic of the Philippines, both for military aid and non-military items, considering the evolving temper of the American Congress.\u201d Afraid, Marcos began to suggests threats again. In one of his presidential speeches, he stated that the bases were a threat to regional peace and security, while reminding the United States of its \"solemn obligation\" to continue aid. He warned that the bases could \"imperil more than they serve our interests.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Presidential Speeches|last=|first=|year=1979|isbn=|location=Manila|pages=275\u2013277|chapter=Speech by Ferdinand E.

In less than 20 days however, the Sandiganbayan listed Imelda's \u201cadvanced age\u201d and health condition as considerations for allowing the accused to post bail. The Fifth Division's (of the Sandiganbayan) ruling read that \u201cthe fact that she is of advanced age and for health reasons, consistent with the doctrine in Enrile vs Sandiganbayan, bail is allowed for these seven cases.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2018/12/04/1874021/sandiganbayan-defends-grant-bail-imelda-marcos|title=Sandiganbayan defends grant of bail to Imelda Marcos|website=philstar.com|accessdate=April 19, 2019}}</ref> The Supreme Court of the Philippines affirms that the Marcoses\u2019 assets, that are beyond the legal and declared government salaries, are considered as ill-gotten wealth. In 1998 however, the Supreme Court acquitted Imelda Marcos of corruption charges from a previous graft conviction in 1993.\n\nSome US Court of Appeals of the Ninth Circuit confirmed a contempt judgement in relation to the assets of Imelda and her son Bongbong in the United States. Although on a different subject matter, this judgement awarded $353.6 million to human rights victims, which was arguably the largest contempt award ever affirmed by an appellate court.\n\n=== Illegal Swiss foundations ===\nIn 1986, following the overthrow of the Marcos regime, it was discovered that as early as 1968, Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos, under the pseudonyms William Saunders and Jane Ryan, opened four bank accounts in Swiss banks amounting to nearly $1 million.<ref name=\":11\"/> Ferdinand Marcos\u2019 salary then was only 60,000 pesos a year.<ref name=\":11\" /> Imelda Marcos, on the other hand, did not have any visible means of income.

In December 1997 (Reuters 1997:3), Switzerland's highest court ordered the Swiss banks to return $500 million of Marcos\u2019 secret accounts to the Philippine government, marking a major step forward in efforts to recover the Marcos\u2019 hidden wealth.<ref name=\":11\" /> That same year, the Philippine Senate, through its Blue Ribbon Committee chairman Franklin Drilon, has revealed the existence of 97 alleged accounts of Ferdinand Marcos in 23 banks in Europe, the United States, and Asia, suspected to be depositories of wealth looted from the Philippine treasury. Thirteen of the 23 banks mentioned by Drilon are in Switzerland, namely: Swiss Credit Bank, Swiss Bank Corp., Bankers Trust AG, Banque Paribas, Affida Bank, Copla, S.A., Lombard Odier et Cie, Standard Chartered Bank, Swiss Volkabank, Bank Ricklin, Compaigne Banque Et d\u2019Investissements, Compaigne de Gestion Et De Banque Gonet Sa Nyon, and Bank Hoffman AG.<ref name=\":11\" />\n\nThe Sandiganbayan 5th Division has recently convicted Imelda Marcos of seven counts of graft for creating and maintaining private foundations in Switzerland, violating the anti-graft law that prohibits public officials from having pecuniary interests in private businesses.<ref name=\":13\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.rappler.com//nation/216333-imelda-marcos-guilty-verdict-graft-case-shows-scheme-earnings-swiss-foundations|title=Imelda Marcos verdict shows scheme to earn $200M from Swiss foundations|last=Buan|first=Lian|website=Rappler|language=en|accessdate=April 19, 2019}}</ref> As the Sandiganbayan's decision reads, \u201cThough named as a foundation, the evidence shows that these entities were put up primarily for the entrepreneurial activity of opening bank accounts and deposits, transferring funds, earning interests and even profit from investment, for the private benefit of the Marcos family as beneficiaries\u201d.

producers such as [[Tommy Brown (record producer)|Tommy Brown]], [[Max Martin]], [[Ilya Salmanzadeh]] and [[Pop Wansel|Andrew \"Pop\" Wansel]]. The album was created in the midst of personal matters, including the death of former boyfriend [[Mac Miller]] and her break-up with fianc\u00e9 [[Pete Davidson]].\n\n''Thank U, Next'' was preceded by two singles, the  [[Thank U, Next (song)|title track]] and \"[[7 Rings]]\", both debuting atop the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart, becoming Grande's first and second number one single in the US, respectively. \"[[Break Up with Your Girlfriend, I'm Bored]]\" was released as the third single on the day of the album's release, peaking at number two on the Hot 100.

The album peaked atop the charts of many countries, including Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States. One month after its release, the album was certified [[RIAA certification|platinum]] by [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA), for moving one million [[album-equivalent units]] in the US.\n\nUpon its release, ''Thank U, Next'' received widespread acclaim from [[Music journalism|music critics]], with many praising its cohesiveness and production.
