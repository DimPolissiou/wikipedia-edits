When the [[South African Medical and Dental Council]] (SAMDC) declined to discipline the chief district surgeon and his assistant who treated Biko, Ames and a group of five academics and physicians raised funds and fought an eight-year legal battle against the medical establishment. Ames risked her personal safety and academic career in her pursuit of justice, taking the dispute to the [[Supreme Court of South Africa|South African Supreme Court]], where she eventually won the case in 1985.\n\nBorn in Pretoria and raised in poverty in Cape Town, Ames became the first woman to receive a Doctor of Medicine degree from the [[University of Cape Town]] in 1964.<ref name=\"hrc\"/> Ames studied the effects of cannabis on the brain and published several articles on the subject. Seeing the therapeutic benefits of cannabis on patients in her own hospital, she became an early proponent of legalization for [[medical cannabis|medicinal use]].

H. Best and F. G. Banting ca. 1924.png|thumb|400px|left|[[Charles H. Best]] and Banting, c. 1924.]]\nAn article he read about the [[pancreas]] piqued Banting's interest in [[diabetes]]. Banting had to give a talk on the pancreas to one of his classes at the [[University of Western Ontario]] on November 1, 1920, and he was therefore reading reports that other scientists had written.<ref name=\"bliss1984\"/>{{rp|51\u201352}} Research by [[Bernhard Naunyn|Naunyn]], [[Oskar Minkowski|Minkowski]], [[Eugene Lindsay Opie|Opie]], [[Edward Albert Sharpey-Schafer|Sharpey-Schafer]], and others suggested that diabetes resulted from a lack of a protein [[hormone]] secreted by the [[islets of Langerhans]] in the pancreas. Schafer had named this putative hormone \"insulin\". The hormone was thought to control the metabolism of sugar; its lack led to an increase of sugar in the blood which was then excreted in urine. Attempts to extract insulin from ground-up pancreas cells were unsuccessful, likely because of the destruction of the insulin by the [[proteolysis]] [[enzyme]] of the pancreas. The challenge was to find a way to extract insulin from the pancreas prior to its destruction.<ref name = nobel/>\n\n[[Moses Barron]] published an article in 1920 which described experimental closure of the [[pancreatic duct]] by [[ligature (medicine)|ligature]]; this further influenced Banting's thinking. The procedure caused deterioration of the cells of the pancreas that secrete [[trypsin]] which breaks down insulin, but it left the islets of Langerhans intact. Banting realized that this procedure would destroy the trypsin-secreting cells but not the insulin. Once the trypsin-secreting cells had died, insulin could be extracted from the islets of Langerhans. Banting discussed this approach with [[John Macleod (physiologist)|J. J. R. Macleod]], Professor of Physiology at the University of Toronto. Macleod provided experimental facilities and the assistance of one of his students, [[Charles Herbert Best|Charles Best]]. Banting and Best, with the assistance of biochemist [[James Collip]], began the production of insulin by this means.<ref name = nobel/>\n\nAs the experiments proceeded, the required quantities could no longer be obtained by performing surgery on living dogs. In November 1921, Banting hit upon the idea of obtaining insulin from the fetal pancreas. He removed the pancreases from fetal calves at a [[William Davies Company|William Davies slaughterhouse]] and found the extracts to be just as potent as those extracted from the dog pancreases. By December 1921, he had also succeeded in extracting insulin from the adult pancreas.<ref name=\"rosenfeld2002\">{{cite journal |last1=Rosenfeld |first1=Louis |title=Insulin: Discovery and Controversy |journal=Clinical Chemistry |date=December 1, 2002 |volume=48 |issue=12 |pages=2270\u20132288 |url=http://clinchem.aaccjnls.org/content/48/12/2270 |language=en |issn=0009-9147}}</ref> Pork and beef would remain the primary commercial sources of insulin until they were replaced by [[Insulin#Synthesis 2|genetically-engineered bacteria]] in the late 20th century.

At the [[Banting and Best Department of Medical Research|Banting and Best Institute]], he focused his research on [[silicosis]], cancer, and the mechanisms of drowning.\n\nIn 1938, Banting's interest in aviation medicine resulted in his participation with the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] (RCAF) in research concerning the physiological problems encountered by pilots operating high-altitude combat aircraft.

H. Best and F. G. Banting ca. 1924.png|thumb|400px|left|[[Charles H. Best]] and Banting, c. 1924.]]\nAn article he read about the [[pancreas]] piqued Banting's interest in [[diabetes]]. Banting had to give a talk on the pancreas to one of his classes at the [[University of Western Ontario]] on November 1, 1920, and he was therefore reading reports that other scientists had written.<ref name=\"bliss1984\"/>{{rp|51\u201352}} Research by [[Bernhard Naunyn|Naunyn]], [[Oskar Minkowski|Minkowski]], [[Eugene Lindsay Opie|Opie]], [[Edward Albert Sharpey-Schafer|Sharpey-Schafer]], and others suggested that diabetes resulted from a lack of a protein [[hormone]] secreted by the [[islets of Langerhans]] in the pancreas. Schafer had named this putative hormone \"insulin\". The hormone was thought to control the metabolism of sugar; its lack led to an increase of sugar in the blood which was then excreted in urine. Attempts to extract insulin from ground-up pancreas cells were unsuccessful, likely because of the destruction of the insulin by the [[proteolysis]] [[enzyme]] of the pancreas. The challenge was to find a way to extract insulin from the pancreas prior to its destruction.<ref name = nobel/>\n\n[[Moses Barron]] published an article in 1920 which described experimental closure of the [[pancreatic duct]] by [[ligature (medicine)|ligature]]; this further influenced Banting's thinking. The procedure caused deterioration of the cells of the pancreas that secrete [[trypsin]] which breaks down insulin, but it left the islets of Langerhans intact. Banting realized that this procedure would destroy the trypsin-secreting cells but not the insulin. Once the trypsin-secreting cells had died, insulin could be extracted from the islets of Langerhans. Banting discussed this approach with [[John Macleod (physiologist)|J. J. R. Macleod]], Professor of Physiology at the University of Toronto. Macleod provided experimental facilities and the assistance of one of his students, [[Charles Herbert Best|Charles Best]]. Banting and Best, with the assistance of biochemist [[James Collip]], began the production of insulin by this means.<ref name = nobel/>\n\nAs the experiments proceeded, the required quantities could no longer be obtained by performing surgery on living dogs. In November 1921, Banting hit upon the idea of obtaining insulin from the fetal pancreas. He removed the pancreases from fetal calves at a [[William Davies Company|William Davies slaughterhouse]] and found the extracts to be just as potent as those extracted from the dog pancreases. By December 1921, he had also succeeded in extracting insulin from the adult pancreas.<ref name=\"rosenfeld2002\">{{cite journal |last1=Rosenfeld |first1=Louis |title=Insulin: Discovery and Controversy |journal=Clinical Chemistry |date=December 1, 2002 |volume=48 |issue=12 |pages=2270\u20132288 |url=http://clinchem.aaccjnls.org/content/48/12/2270 |language=en |issn=0009-9147}}</ref> Pork and beef would remain the primary commercial sources of insulin until they were replaced by [[Insulin#Synthesis 2|genetically-engineered bacteria]] in the late 20th century.

He played in [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) for the [[Philadelphia Phillies]], [[New York Giants (NL)|New York Giants]], [[Boston Braves (baseball)|Boston Braves]] and the [[Brooklyn Robins]] between 1915 and 1930.\n\nBorn in [[Sioux City, Iowa]], Bancroft played in [[minor league baseball]] from 1909 through 1914, at which point he was bought by the Phillies. The Giants traded for Bancroft during the 1920 season. After playing for the Giants through the 1923 season, he became [[player-manager]] of the Braves, serving in that role for four years. After he was fired by the Braves, Bancroft played two seasons for the Robins and ended his playing career with the Giants the next season. He coached with the Giants, then managed in the minor leagues and the [[All-American Girls Professional Baseball League]].\n\nBancroft was part of the Giants' [[World Series]] championship teams in [[1921 World Series|1921]] and [[1922 World Series|1922]]. He was also a part of the [[National League]] [[List of National League pennant winners|pennant-winning]] teams of 1915 and 1923. Considered an excellent defensive shortstop and a smart ball player, Bancroft was elected to the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Baseball Hall of Fame]] by the [[Veterans Committee]] in 1971. However, his election was not without controversy, as the Veterans Committee included former teammates of Bancroft, resulting in charges of cronyism against the Veterans Committee.\n\n==Early life==\nBancroft was born on April 20, 1891, in [[Sioux City, Iowa]], the youngest of three children of Ella ([[Name at birth|n\u00e9e]] Gearhart) and Frank Bancroft. Frank worked as a news vendor on the [[Milwaukee Railroad]].<ref name=sabr>{{cite web|first=Trey|last=Strecker |url=http://sabr.org/bioproj/person/8822919c |title=Dave Bancroft |publisher=[[Society for American Baseball Research]]|accessdate=April 27, 2012}}</ref><ref name=desmoines>{{cite news|url=http://www.desmoinesregister.com/article/19540328/SPORTS11/50623012/Dave-Bancroft-Sioux-City-1954 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130121120231/http://www.desmoinesregister.com/article/19540328/SPORTS11/50623012/Dave-Bancroft-Sioux-City-1954 |url-status=dead |archive-date=January 21, 2013 |title=Dave Bancroft, Sioux City |first=Bert |last=McGrane |newspaper=The Des Moines Register |date=March 28, 1954 |accessdate=October 10, 2012 }}</ref> Bancroft attended Hopkins Grade School and Sioux City High School.<ref name=sabr/>\n\n==Career==\n\n===Early career===\nIn the summer after his junior year of high school, at the age of 18, Bancroft began his professional career in 1909 with the [[Duluth White Sox]] of the Class-D [[Minnesota\u2013Wisconsin League]].

He played in [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) for the [[Philadelphia Phillies]], [[New York Giants (NL)|New York Giants]], [[Boston Braves (baseball)|Boston Braves]] and the [[Brooklyn Robins]] between 1915 and 1930.\n\nBorn in [[Sioux City, Iowa]], Bancroft played in [[minor league baseball]] from 1909 through 1914, at which point he was bought by the Phillies. The Giants traded for Bancroft during the 1920 season. After playing for the Giants through the 1923 season, he became [[player-manager]] of the Braves, serving in that role for four years. After he was fired by the Braves, Bancroft played two seasons for the Robins and ended his playing career with the Giants the next season. He coached with the Giants, then managed in the minor leagues and the [[All-American Girls Professional Baseball League]].\n\nBancroft was part of the Giants' [[World Series]] championship teams in [[1921 World Series|1921]] and [[1922 World Series|1922]]. He was also a part of the [[National League]] [[List of National League pennant winners|pennant-winning]] teams of 1915 and 1923. Considered an excellent defensive shortstop and a smart ball player, Bancroft was elected to the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Baseball Hall of Fame]] by the [[Veterans Committee]] in 1971. However, his election was not without controversy, as the Veterans Committee included former teammates of Bancroft, resulting in charges of cronyism against the Veterans Committee.\n\n==Early life==\nBancroft was born on April 20, 1891, in [[Sioux City, Iowa]], the youngest of three children of Ella ([[Name at birth|n\u00e9e]] Gearhart) and Frank Bancroft. Frank worked as a news vendor on the [[Milwaukee Railroad]].<ref name=sabr>{{cite web|first=Trey|last=Strecker |url=http://sabr.org/bioproj/person/8822919c |title=Dave Bancroft |publisher=[[Society for American Baseball Research]]|accessdate=April 27, 2012}}</ref><ref name=desmoines>{{cite news|url=http://www.desmoinesregister.com/article/19540328/SPORTS11/50623012/Dave-Bancroft-Sioux-City-1954 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130121120231/http://www.desmoinesregister.com/article/19540328/SPORTS11/50623012/Dave-Bancroft-Sioux-City-1954 |url-status=dead |archive-date=January 21, 2013 |title=Dave Bancroft, Sioux City |first=Bert |last=McGrane |newspaper=The Des Moines Register |date=March 28, 1954 |accessdate=October 10, 2012 }}</ref> Bancroft attended Hopkins Grade School and Sioux City High School.<ref name=sabr/>\n\n==Career==\n\n===Early career===\nIn the summer after his junior year of high school, at the age of 18, Bancroft began his professional career in 1909 with the [[Duluth White Sox]] of the Class-D [[Minnesota\u2013Wisconsin League]].

It was designed to provide answers to questions beginning with the word \"How\". Each episode began with the presenters all raising one hand and saying \"How\" simultaneously (playing on the stereotypical [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] [[How (greeting)|greeting]]). Common topics covered included science, history, mathematics, and simple puzzles. The series came to an end in 1981 when [[Southern Television]] lost its [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] franchise, but was revived as ''How 2'' in 1990 by [[Television South|TVS]]. In 2006 the final series was broadcast, having waited more than a year for transmission. The show was rebroadcast on [[STV (TV channel)|STV]] in late 2009 as part of their weekend strand Wknd@stv broadcasting series 14 and 15. Repeats of the rebroadcasts on the weekend strand were also shown on the \n[[CITV]] Channel in October Half-Term 2009.\n\nA similar CITV show to appear a few years later was ''[[The Big Bang (TV series)|The Big Bang]]'', presented by ''How 2'''s own [[Gareth Jones (presenter)|Gareth Jones]] and [[Violet Berlin]]. ''The Big Bang'' had a more scientific slant, focusing on performing fun experiments involving simple physics and chemistry. Other similar British television series included ''[[Don't Ask Me (TV programme)|Don't Ask Me]]''. [[Fred Dinenage]] was the only presenter to appear in both incarnations of ''How'', presenting the shows for a total of 31 years. On 6 January 2013, as part of CITV's Old Skool Weekend (a televised event celebrating the strand's 30th anniversary), the first episode of the 1995 series was shown. Prior to this, a ''How 2'' segment was featured on the ''30 Years of CITV'' documentary that aired on ITV on 29 December 2012 and featured interviews with Dinenage and Jones.\n\n==Series overview==\n\n{|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Series!!Start date!!End date!!Episodes\n|-\n| 1 || 26 September 1990|| 23 November 1990|| 10\n|-\n| 2 || 23 September 1991|| 25 November 1991|| 10\n|-\n| 3 || 7 September 1992|| 9 November 1992|| 10\n|-\n| 4 || 6 September 1993|| 13 December 1993|| 15\n|-\n| 5 || 5 September 1994|| 12 December 1994|| 15\n|-\n| 6 || 4 September 1995|| 11 December 1995|| 14\n|-\n| 7 || 9 September 1996|| 16 December 1996|| 15<sup>1</sup>\n|-\n| 8 || 1 September 1997|| 15 December 1997|| <sup>2</sup>16<sup>3</sup>\n|-\n| 9 || 5 January 1999|| 6 April 1999|| 13\n|-\n| 10 || 10 January 2000|| 11 April 2000|| 13\n|-\n| 11 || 22 January 2001|| 16 February 2001|| 20\n|-\n| 12 || 11 February 2002|| 22 February 2002|| 10\n|-\n| 13 || 10 January 2003|| 14 March 2003|| 10\n|-\n| 14 || 4 June 2004|| 27 August 2004|| 13\n|-\n| 15 || 5 May 2006|| 1 September 2006|| 13\n|}\n;Notes\n<sup>1</sup> The last episode of the series was a 30th anniversary special.<br />\n<sup>2</sup> Before that, there was \"The Best of How 2\" which aired on 18 August 1997.<br />\n<sup>3</sup> The last episode of the series was a Christmas special.\n\n==''How Goes 2''==\nThere was no series aired in 1998 but there was a spin-off series called ''How Goes 2'', which aired from 25 February to 15 April 1998.

It is a bird of the tropical oceans, breeding on islands throughout the [[equator]]ial zone.\n\n== Taxonomy ==\n\nThe sooty tern was described by Linnaeus in 1766 as ''Sterna fuscata'', bearing this name for many years until the genus ''Sterna'' was split up. It is now known as ''Onychoprion fuscatus''.<ref>Bridge ''et al.'' (2005)</ref> The genus name is from [[Ancient Greek]] ''onux'', \"claw\" or \"nail\", and ''prion'', \"saw\". The specific ''fuscatus'' is [[Latin]] for \"dark\".<ref name=job>{{cite book | last= Jobling | first= James A | year= 2010| title= The Helm Dictionary of Scientific Bird Names | url= https://archive.org/details/Helm_Dictionary_of_Scientific_Bird_Names_by_James_A._Jobling | publisher= Christopher Helm | location = London | isbn = 978-1-4081-2501-4 | pages = [https://archive.org/details/Helm_Dictionary_of_Scientific_Bird_Names_by_James_A._Jobling/page/n167 167], 282}}</ref>\n\nColloquially, it is known as the wideawake tern or just wideawake. This refers to the incessant calls produced by a colony of these birds, as does the [[Hawaiian (language)|Hawaiian]] name ''\u02bbewa \u02bbewa'' which roughly means \"[[cacophony]]\".<ref>From ''\u02bbewa'', \"crooked, out of shape, imperfect\" (Pukui ''et al.'' 1992: p.17)</ref> In most of [[Polynesia]] its name is ''manutara'' or similar &ndash; literally \"tern-bird\",<ref>The Polynesian word for terns (''tara'') is the same as the word for \"pointed\"; it is easy to see how these sharp-billed fork-tailed birds came to be called thus (Tregear, 1891)</ref> though it might be better rendered in English as \"the tern\" or \"common tern\". This refers to the fact that wherever [[Polynesian seafarer]]s went on their long voyages, they usually would find these birds in astounding numbers. It is also known as ''kaveka'' in the [[Marquesas Islands]], where dishes using its eggs are a delicacy.<ref name=\"BlondBrash2006\">{{cite book|last1=Blond|first1=Becca|last2=Brash|first2=Celeste|last3=Rogers|first3=Hilary|title=Tahiti & French Polynesia.

Some recent authors further subdivide the [[Indopacific]] population into up to 8 subspecies altogether, but much of the variation is really [[cline (population genetics)|clinal]].

The wings and deeply forked tail are long, and it has dark black upperparts and white underparts. It has black legs and bill. The average life span is 32 years.<ref>[http://www.fws.gov/midway/sote.html FWS]</ref> Juvenile sooty terns are scaly grey above and below. The sooty tern is unlikely to be confused with any tern apart from the similarly dark-backed but smaller [[bridled tern]] (''O. anaethetus''). It is darker-backed than that species, and has a broader white forehead and no pale neck collar.\n\nThe call is a loud piercing ''ker-wack-a-wack'' or ''kvaark''.\n\n== Ecology ==\n[[Image:Sooty tern on nest.jpg|thumb|left|Adult ''O. f. nubilosus'' with egg in \"nest\", [[Seychelles]]]]\n[[Image:Bird flocks Bird Island Seychelles.jpg|thumb|right|''O. f. nubilosus'' at [[Bird Island, Seychelles]], home to more than a million of sooty terns at its peak]]\nSooty terns breed in colonies on rocky or [[coral]] islands.<ref name = streets1877>Streets (1877)</ref> It nests in a ground scrape or hole and lays one to three eggs. It feeds by picking [[fish]] from the surface in marine environments, often in large flocks, and rarely comes to land except to breed, and can stay out to sea for 3 to 10 years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.drytortugasinfo.com/sooty-tern.html|title=The Sooty Tern|publisher=}}</ref> Due to the lack oil in its feathers, it cannot float, and spends that entire time on the wing.<ref>{{cite episode|title=Pioneers Of The Deep |series=Life On Fire |first1=Bertrand |last1=Loyer |first2=Jacques |last2=Bedel |first3=Fran\u00e7ois |last3=de Riberolles |first4=Jeremy |last4=Irons (Narrator) |date=January 2014}}</ref>\n\nThis bird is [[bird migration|migratory]] and [[Biological dispersal|dispersive]], wintering more widely through the tropical oceans. It has very marine habits compared to most terns; sooty terns are generally found inland only after severe [[storm]]s. The [[Field Museum]], for example, has a male specimen which was found exhausted on August 2, 1933 on the slopes of [[Mount Cameroon]] above [[Buea]], about {{convert|1000|m|ft|abbr=on}} [[Above mean sea level|ASL]], after foul weather had hit the [[Gulf of Guinea]].<ref>Boulton & Rand (1952)</ref> This species is a rare vagrant to western [[Europe]], although a bird was present at [[Cemlyn Bay and lagoon|Cemlyn Bay]], [[Wales]] for 11 days in July 2005.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.michaelmckee.co.uk/bird_s.asp?ID=325&Region=Rarities&Year=2005|title=Sooty Tern Cemlyn Bay, Anglesey, Wales|website=michaelmckee.co.uk}}</ref>\n\nIt is also not normally found on the [[Pacific]] coasts of the [[Americas]] due to its [[pelagic]] habits. At [[Baja California]], where several nesting locations are offshore, it can be seen more frequently, whereas for example only two individuals have ever been recorded on the coast of [[El Salvador]] - one [[bird ringing|ring]] recovered in 1972, and a bird photographed on October 10, 2001 at [[Lake Olomega]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/journals/nab/v056n03/p00369-p00371.pdf|title=Mexico - Central America|date=2002|website=The University of New Mexico}}</ref><!-- source has only \"Olomega\"; possibly a village or minor settlement at the lake --> which was probably blown there by a storm&nbsp;.<ref>Herrera ''et al.''

The ''manutara'' played an important role in the ''[[tangata manu]]'' (\"birdman\") ritual: whichever ''hopu'' (champion) could retrieve the first ''manutara'' egg from [[Motu Nui]] islet would become that year's ''tangata manu''; his [[clan]] would receive prime access to resources, especially seabird eggs.\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nImage:Sooty tern flying.JPG|Sooty tern rookery on Tern Island ([[French Frigate Shoals]])\nImage:Sooty Tern chick.JPG|Chick on Tern Island, French Frigate Shoals\nImage:BFAL SOTE shade.JPG|Sooty tern chicks seeking shade under the shadow of a young [[black-footed albatross]]\nImage:Frigate sooty.JPG|A chick is snatched by a predatory [[great frigatebird]] \nFile:Onychoprion fuscatus -Phillip Island, Norfolk Island group, Australia -egg-8.jpg|Egg\n</gallery>\n\n== Footnotes ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n* [[Rudyerd Boulton|Boulton, Rudyerd]] & Rand, A.L.

It is a bird of the tropical oceans, breeding on islands throughout the [[equator]]ial zone.\n\n== Taxonomy ==\n\nThe sooty tern was described by Linnaeus in 1766 as ''Sterna fuscata'', bearing this name for many years until the genus ''Sterna'' was split up. It is now known as ''Onychoprion fuscatus''.<ref>Bridge ''et al.'' (2005)</ref> The genus name is from [[Ancient Greek]] ''onux'', \"claw\" or \"nail\", and ''prion'', \"saw\". The specific ''fuscatus'' is [[Latin]] for \"dark\".<ref name=job>{{cite book | last= Jobling | first= James A | year= 2010| title= The Helm Dictionary of Scientific Bird Names | url= https://archive.org/details/Helm_Dictionary_of_Scientific_Bird_Names_by_James_A._Jobling | publisher= Christopher Helm | location = London | isbn = 978-1-4081-2501-4 | pages = [https://archive.org/details/Helm_Dictionary_of_Scientific_Bird_Names_by_James_A._Jobling/page/n167 167], 282}}</ref>\n\nColloquially, it is known as the wideawake tern or just wideawake. This refers to the incessant calls produced by a colony of these birds, as does the [[Hawaiian (language)|Hawaiian]] name ''\u02bbewa \u02bbewa'' which roughly means \"[[cacophony]]\".<ref>From ''\u02bbewa'', \"crooked, out of shape, imperfect\" (Pukui ''et al.'' 1992: p.17)</ref> In most of [[Polynesia]] its name is ''manutara'' or similar &ndash; literally \"tern-bird\",<ref>The Polynesian word for terns (''tara'') is the same as the word for \"pointed\"; it is easy to see how these sharp-billed fork-tailed birds came to be called thus (Tregear, 1891)</ref> though it might be better rendered in English as \"the tern\" or \"common tern\". This refers to the fact that wherever [[Polynesian seafarer]]s went on their long voyages, they usually would find these birds in astounding numbers. It is also known as ''kaveka'' in the [[Marquesas Islands]], where dishes using its eggs are a delicacy.<ref name=\"BlondBrash2006\">{{cite book|last1=Blond|first1=Becca|last2=Brash|first2=Celeste|last3=Rogers|first3=Hilary|title=Tahiti & French Polynesia.

Some recent authors further subdivide the [[Indopacific]] population into up to 8 subspecies altogether, but much of the variation is really [[cline (population genetics)|clinal]]. The affinities of eastern Pacific birds (including the famous ''manutara'' of [[Easter Island]]) are most strongly contested.\n\n''Onychoprion fuscatus fuscatus'' <small>(Linnaeus, 1766)</small> &ndash; Atlantic sooty tern<br />\nUnderparts white.

The wings and deeply forked tail are long, and it has dark black upperparts and white underparts. It has black legs and bill. The average life span is 32 years.<ref>[http://www.fws.gov/midway/sote.html FWS]</ref> Juvenile sooty terns are scaly grey above and below. The sooty tern is unlikely to be confused with any tern apart from the similarly dark-backed but smaller [[bridled tern]] (''O. anaethetus''). It is darker-backed than that species, and has a broader white forehead and no pale neck collar.\n\nThe call is a loud piercing ''ker-wack-a-wack'' or ''kvaark''.\n\n== Ecology ==\n[[Image:Sooty tern on nest.jpg|thumb|left|Adult ''O. f. nubilosus'' with egg in \"nest\", [[Seychelles]]]]\n[[Image:Bird flocks Bird Island Seychelles.jpg|thumb|right|''O. f. nubilosus'' at [[Bird Island, Seychelles]], home to more than a million of sooty terns at its peak]]\nSooty terns breed in colonies on rocky or [[coral]] islands.<ref name = streets1877>Streets (1877)</ref> It nests in a ground scrape or hole and lays one to three eggs. It feeds by picking [[fish]] from the surface in marine environments, often in large flocks, and rarely comes to land except to breed, and can stay out to sea for 3 to 10 years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.drytortugasinfo.com/sooty-tern.html|title=The Sooty Tern|publisher=}}</ref> Due to the lack oil in its feathers, it cannot float, and spends that entire time on the wing.<ref>{{cite episode|title=Pioneers Of The Deep |series=Life On Fire |first1=Bertrand |last1=Loyer |first2=Jacques |last2=Bedel |first3=Fran\u00e7ois |last3=de Riberolles |first4=Jeremy |last4=Irons (Narrator) |date=January 2014}}</ref>\n\nThis bird is [[bird migration|migratory]] and [[Biological dispersal|dispersive]], wintering more widely through the tropical oceans. It has very marine habits compared to most terns; sooty terns are generally found inland only after severe [[storm]]s. The [[Field Museum]], for example, has a male specimen which was found exhausted on August 2, 1933 on the slopes of [[Mount Cameroon]] above [[Buea]], about {{convert|1000|m|ft|abbr=on}} [[Above mean sea level|ASL]], after foul weather had hit the [[Gulf of Guinea]].<ref>Boulton & Rand (1952)</ref> This species is a rare vagrant to western [[Europe]], although a bird was present at [[Cemlyn Bay and lagoon|Cemlyn Bay]], [[Wales]] for 11 days in July 2005.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.michaelmckee.co.uk/bird_s.asp?ID=325&Region=Rarities&Year=2005|title=Sooty Tern Cemlyn Bay, Anglesey, Wales|website=michaelmckee.co.uk}}</ref>\n\nIt is also not normally found on the [[Pacific]] coasts of the [[Americas]] due to its [[pelagic]] habits. At [[Baja California]], where several nesting locations are offshore, it can be seen more frequently, whereas for example only two individuals have ever been recorded on the coast of [[El Salvador]] - one [[bird ringing|ring]] recovered in 1972, and a bird photographed on October 10, 2001 at [[Lake Olomega]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/journals/nab/v056n03/p00369-p00371.pdf|title=Mexico - Central America|date=2002|website=The University of New Mexico}}</ref><!-- source has only \"Olomega\"; possibly a village or minor settlement at the lake --> which was probably blown there by a storm&nbsp;.<ref>Herrera ''et al.''

The ''manutara'' played an important role in the ''[[tangata manu]]'' (\"birdman\") ritual: whichever ''hopu'' (champion) could retrieve the first ''manutara'' egg from [[Motu Nui]] islet would become that year's ''tangata manu''; his [[clan]] would receive prime access to resources, especially seabird eggs.\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nImage:Sooty tern flying.JPG|Sooty tern rookery on Tern Island ([[French Frigate Shoals]])\nImage:Sooty Tern chick.JPG|Chick on Tern Island, French Frigate Shoals\nImage:BFAL SOTE shade.JPG|Sooty tern chicks seeking shade under the shadow of a young [[black-footed albatross]]\nImage:Frigate sooty.JPG|A chick is snatched by a predatory [[great frigatebird]] \nFile:Onychoprion fuscatus -Phillip Island, Norfolk Island group, Australia -egg-8.jpg|Egg\n</gallery>\n\n== Footnotes ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n* [[Rudyerd Boulton|Boulton, Rudyerd]] & Rand, A.L.
