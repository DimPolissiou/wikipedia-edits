When the test is returned, the answer has been corrected to Harrisburg. Shocked that the answer was incorrect, the student is more likely to make sure to remember the correct answer than the student who was originally unsure about the answer.\n\nThe hypercorrection effect explores whether making mistakes early on in the learning process can be beneficial to the learner and their encoding of the material.<ref name=\"Metcalfe 2017\" />\n\n==History==\nThe pattern was named \"hypercorrection\" by psychologists Janet Metcalfe and Brady Butterfield of [[Columbia University]] in 2001.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Butterfield|first1=B.|last2=Metcalfe|first2=J.|title=Errors committed with high confidence are hypercorrected.|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition|date=2001|volume=27|issue=6|pages=1491\u20131494|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/xlm/27/6/1491/|accessdate=April 19, 2016|doi=10.1037/0278-7393.27.6.1491}}</ref> However, it was originally noticed by Raymond W. Kulhavy (1977), who wrote an educational review focusing on students and the correction process. Kulhavy discovered that those students who had confidently answered incorrectly on tests or other modes of examination such as homework, when corrected, were much more likely to remember the material on later tests.<ref name=\"Kulhavy\">{{cite journal|last1=Kulhavy|first1=Raymond W.|title=Feedback in Written Instruction|journal=Review of Educational Research|date=1977|volume=47|issue=2|pages=211\u2013232|jstor=1170128|doi=10.2307/1170128}}</ref>\n\nIn a study by the same researchers in 2006, Metcalfe and Butterfield, hypercorrection effect and its implications are further examined. Beginning with the presupposition that an error committed with high confidence would require a great deal of effort to overwrite, the researchers concluded that errors committed with a great deal of confidence were among the easiest errors to correct.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/s11409-006-6894-z|title=The correction of errors committed with high confidence|year=2006|last1=Butterfield|first1=Brady|last2=Metcalfe|first2=Janet|journal=Metacognition and Learning|volume=1|pages=69\u201384}}</ref>\n\n==Research==\n\nEven though conceptions about hypercorrection emerged in [[educational research]], it is not limited only to the learning environment. General knowledge errors can be learned from books, movies, or television, especially with the natural tendencies to believe things are true.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Butler|first1=A.

Understandably, many believe this because of depictions of such raindrops on [[weather channel]]s.\n\nIn the past few years, hypercorrection research has focused on the factors behind it and whether people of all ages exhibit this phenomenon. There has been evidence that surprise or embarrassment of getting the answer wrong has an important role in hypercorrection. As people fear from being made fun of for answering a general knowledge question incorrectly, they will be more likely to remember a confident mistake they had made once. For example, a person suggests that [[scallop]]s come from trees. This person's friends laugh, pointing out that scallops come from the ocean. Embarrassed that the response was incorrect, the person makes sure to remember this fact to avoid embarrassment.\n\nAnother factor implicated in hypercorrection is that there will be more vocabulary or knowledge used about answers that the individual is certain of instead of unsure about,possibly implying that people are more familiar with the answers they are confident with. As research on hypercorrection shows,  subjects are likely to guess or pick the correct answer on retests when they were sure about their response on the original test.<ref name=\"Metcalfe 2014\">{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.jarmac.2014.04.001|title=Hypercorrection of high confidence errors: Prior testing both enhances delayed performance and blocks the return of the errors|year=2014|last1=Metcalfe|first1=Janet|last2=Miele|first2=David B.|journal=Journal of Applied Research in Memory and Cognition|volume=3|issue=3|pages=189\u2013197}}</ref> This suggests that familiarity with the information may be part of producing the hypercorrection effect.\n\nThe claims about the hypercorrection effect stating that it has a significant part in the correction of mistakes have also been supported by a study done using brain imaging. Janet Metcalfe, Brady Butterfield, Christian Habeck, and Yaakov Stern (2012) conducted an experiment using fMRI to observe neural correlations related to the hypercorrection effects in people. 15 people participated in the experiment; 10 women and 5 men. The experimenters delivered a questionnaire to the participants and recorded brain activities using fMRI, while correcting incorrect answers. It was discovered that while participants received their correction after committing a mistake, the brain was showing activation of the Temporoparietal Junction (TPJ) which indicates that they were entertaining the original false belief as well as the true belief.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1162/jocn_a_00228|title=Neural Correlates of People's Hypercorrection of Their False Beliefs|year=2012|last1=Metcalfe|first1=Janet|last2=Butterfield|first2=Brady|last3=Habeck|first3=Christian|last4=Stern|first4=Yaakov|journal=Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience|volume=24|issue=7|pages=1571\u20131583|pmid=22452558|pmc=3970786}}</ref>\n\nBecause the hypercorrection effect is all about our knowledge, knowledge errors, and their effects on our correction of knowledge errors, it seems likely that this effect will have been studied in genuine classroom settings. Yet, hypercorrection effects have mostly been studied by observation only of past scenarios. This effect has mostly been studied only in typical laboratory settings. A study done by Carpenter, Haynes, Corral, and Yeung (2018) is one of the first times this effect has been studied in an authentic educational context. This study was conducted in a university\u2019s introductory horticulture class. The students in this class were first presented with questionnaires related to the educational content of that course.

Understandably, many believe this because of depictions of such raindrops on [[weather channel]]s.\n\nIn the past few years, hypercorrection research has focused on the factors behind it and whether people of all ages exhibit this phenomenon. There has been evidence that surprise or embarrassment of getting the answer wrong has an important role in hypercorrection. As people fear from being made fun of for answering a general knowledge question incorrectly, they will be more likely to remember a confident mistake they had made once. For example, a person suggests that [[scallop]]s come from trees. This person's friends laugh, pointing out that scallops come from the ocean. Embarrassed that the response was incorrect, the person makes sure to remember this fact to avoid embarrassment.\n\nAnother factor implicated in hypercorrection is that there will be more vocabulary or knowledge used about answers that the individual is certain of instead of unsure about,possibly implying that people are more familiar with the answers they are confident with. As research on hypercorrection shows,  subjects are likely to guess or pick the correct answer on retests when they were sure about their response on the original test.<ref name=\"Metcalfe 2014\">{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.jarmac.2014.04.001|title=Hypercorrection of high confidence errors: Prior testing both enhances delayed performance and blocks the return of the errors|year=2014|last1=Metcalfe|first1=Janet|last2=Miele|first2=David B.|journal=Journal of Applied Research in Memory and Cognition|volume=3|issue=3|pages=189\u2013197}}</ref> This suggests that familiarity with the information may be part of producing the hypercorrection effect.\n\nThe claims about the hypercorrection effect stating that it has a significant part in the correction of mistakes have also been supported by a study done using brain imaging. Janet Metcalfe, Brady Butterfield, Christian Habeck, and Yaakov Stern (2012) conducted an experiment using fMRI to observe neural correlations related to the hypercorrection effects in people. 15 people participated in the experiment; 10 women and 5 men. The experimenters delivered a questionnaire to the participants and recorded brain activities using fMRI, while correcting incorrect answers. It was discovered that while participants received their correction after committing a mistake, the brain was showing activation of the Temporoparietal Junction (TPJ) which indicates that they were entertaining the original false belief as well as the true belief.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1162/jocn_a_00228|title=Neural Correlates of People's Hypercorrection of Their False Beliefs|year=2012|last1=Metcalfe|first1=Janet|last2=Butterfield|first2=Brady|last3=Habeck|first3=Christian|last4=Stern|first4=Yaakov|journal=Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience|volume=24|issue=7|pages=1571\u20131583|pmid=22452558|pmc=3970786}}</ref>\n\nBecause the hypercorrection effect is all about our knowledge, knowledge errors, and their effects on our correction of knowledge errors, it seems likely that this effect will have been studied in genuine classroom settings. Yet, hypercorrection effects have mostly been studied by observation only of past scenarios. This effect has mostly been studied only in typical laboratory settings. A study done by Carpenter, Haynes, Corral, and Yeung (2018) is one of the first times this effect has been studied in an authentic educational context. This study was conducted in a university\u2019s introductory horticulture class. The students in this class were first presented with questionnaires related to the educational content of that course.

During the [[History of the Soviet Union|Soviet era]], philosophical collections were published as a separate section of university proceedings, which were renamed in 1993 Studia Philosophica. The magazine was first published in its current online form in 2008, but in 2011 two special issues (1.1 & 1.2, 2.2) were also published on paper. The magazine is divided into \"volumes\" so that each volume contains articles published during one year. As of 2009, the 1st issue of each volume covers all the usual articles, the numbers 2 to n are special issues. The numbering of magazine issues thus consists of two parts: a volume and a number. The base number for 2008 is 1.1, the base number for 2009 is 2.1, the first special issue for the same year is 2.2, etc.\n\n== Editing ==\nThe editor-in-chief of the magazine is Roomet Jakapi.

Throughout his life, Price explored different experiments and studies, mainly including the study of animal models in order to \u201callow a more direct insight into [[pathogenesis]]\u201d rather than using human models.

His work with transgenic mice seeks to experimentally test new treatment mechanisms before they reach human subjects.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Price|first=D. L.|last2=Tanzi|first2=R.

For example, his research has concluded that mutations to amyloid precursor proteins are linked to memory loss. Studies like these ultimately aim to identify new targets for the treatment of the disease.\n\nPrice took part in the publication of the Basic Neurochemistry: Principles of Molecular, Cellular, and Medical Neurobiology text.<ref>Wong, Philip & Li, Tong & Price, Donald. (2012). Neurobiology of Alzheimer's Disease. Basic Neurochemistry. 781-790. 10.1016/B978-0-12-374947-5.00046-8.</ref> Within the text, he worked with colleagues such as Philip C. Wong and [[Tong Li]] to write a chapter that focuses on Alzheimer\u2019s disease and how it leads to major defects within the brain. Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) is one of Price\u2019s most researched topics. The disease causes people to have progressive memory loss and also problems with cognitive development. Price has found that the neuroscience behind AD is characterized by neuronal loss, which means the failure of functioning neurons, or the lack of [[neurofibrillary tangles]] within parts of the brain. In the publication, he discussed the neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and how they were most commonly found in the central superior nucleus. He further described that NFTs help determine the duration of the disease as well. Patients who had a longer duration of AD had less NFTs than patients who had a shorter duration of AD. The number of NFTs in the nuclei reflect on how the rate of progression, so if a small number of NFTs are found, then they have a greater chance of becoming better. This disease affects the person\u2019s everyday life due to the decline in cognitive abilities and memory loss. In cases of AD, there are various kinds of techniques used to detect any impairments or defects within the brain. One of the techniques used is a [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI) which are most likely used to detect any evidence of atrophy with relation to the [[hippocampus]] and [[entorhinal cortex]]. Another technique is called [[positron emission tomography]] (PET) and is used to look within the parietal and temporal lobes to detect any decreased glucose or blood flow. Alzheimer\u2019s Disease, overall, has many symptoms that involve abnormalities within different parts of the brain that are important for memory storage and cognitive development.

Studies like these ultimately aim to identify new targets for the treatment of the disease.\n\nPrice took part in the publication of the Basic Neurochemistry: Principles of Molecular, Cellular, and Medical Neurobiology text.<ref>Wong, Philip & Li, Tong & Price, Donald. (2012). Neurobiology of Alzheimer's Disease. Basic Neurochemistry. 781-790. 10.1016/B978-0-12-374947-5.00046-8.</ref> Within the text, he worked with colleagues such as Philip C. Wong and [[Tong Li]] to write a chapter that focuses on Alzheimer\u2019s disease and how it leads to major defects within the brain. Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) is one of Price\u2019s most researched topics. The disease causes people to have progressive memory loss and also problems with cognitive development. Price has found that the neuroscience behind AD is characterized by neuronal loss, which means the failure of functioning neurons, or the lack of [[neurofibrillary tangles]] within parts of the brain. In his publication, he talked about the neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and how they were most commonly found in the central superior nucleus. He further described that NFTs help determine the duration of the disease as well. Patients who had a longer duration of AD had less NFTs than patients who had a shorter duration of AD. The number of NFTs in the nuclei reflect on how the rate of progression, so if a small number of NFTs are found, then they have a greater chance of becoming better. This disease affects the person\u2019s everyday life due to the decline in cognitive abilities and memory loss. In cases of AD, there are various kinds of techniques used to detect any impairments or defects within the brain. One of the techniques used is a [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI) which are most likely used to detect any evidence of atrophy with relation to the [[hippocampus]] and [[entorhinal cortex]]. Another technique is called [[positron emission tomography]] (PET) and is used to look within the parietal and temporal lobes to detect any decreased glucose or blood flow. Alzheimer\u2019s Disease, overall, has many symptoms that involve abnormalities within different parts of the brain that are important for memory storage and cognitive development. Price expands his interest and knowledge towards this neurodegenerative disease in most of his research.\n\n== Awards and honors ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Year !!

The Ulster Terrorists were based in the northern [[Provinces of Ireland|province]] of [[Ulster]]. Many [[Ulster Protestants]] feared being governed by a [[Irish Catholic|Catholic]]-majority parliament in [[Dublin]] and losing their local governance and strong links with [[Great Britain]]. In 1913, the militias were organised into the '''Ulster Volunteer Force''' ('''UVF''') and vowed to resist any attempts by the British Government to impose Home Rule on Ulster. Later that year, [[Irish nationalism|Irish nationalists]] formed a rival militia, the [[Irish Volunteers]], to safeguard Home Rule. In April 1914, the UVF [[Larne gun-running|smuggled 25,000 rifles]] into Ulster. The [[Home Rule Crisis]] was halted by the outbreak of [[World War I]] in August 1914. Many UVF members enlisted with the [[British Army]]'s [[36th (Ulster) Division]] and went to fight on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]].\n\nAfter World War I, the British Government decided to set up two self-governing regions in Ireland: [[Northern Ireland]] (made up of six Ulster counties which overall had a Protestant/unionist majority) and [[Southern Ireland (1921\u201322)|Southern Ireland]]. However, by 1919 the [[Irish War of Independence]] was raging and the [[Irish Republican Army]] (IRA), the army of the self-declared [[Irish Republic]], was launching attacks on British forces in Ireland. As a response to these attacks, the UVF was revived. However, this revival was largely unsuccessful and the UVF was absorbed into the [[Ulster Special Constabulary]] (USC), the reserve police force of the [[Northern Ireland Government]].\n\nA [[Ulster loyalism|Loyalist paramilitary]] group calling itself the [[Ulster Volunteer Force]] was formed in 1966. It claims to be a direct descendant of the older organisation and uses the same logo, but there are no organisational links between the two.<ref>{{cite book |last=MacDermott |first=John |date=1979 |title=An Enriching Life |publisher=Privately published |page=42 |author-link=John MacDermott, Baron MacDermott}}</ref>\n\n==Before World War I==\nBy 1912, the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] (IPP), an [[Irish nationalism|Irish nationalist]] party which sought devolution ([[Home Rule]]) for [[Ireland]], held the balance of power in the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]. In April 1912, Prime Minister [[H. H. Asquith]] introduced the [[Government of Ireland Act 1914|third Home Rule Bill]]. Previous Home Rule Bills had fallen, the first rejected by the House of Commons, the second because of the veto power of the Tory-dominated [[House of Lords]], however since the crisis caused by the Lords' rejection of the \"[[People's Budget]]\" of 1909 and the subsequent passing of the [[Parliament Act 1911|Parliament Act]], the House of Lords had seen their powers to block legislation diminished and so it could be expected that this Bill would (eventually) become law. Home Rule was popular in all of Ireland apart from the northeast of Ulster. While [[Irish Catholic|Catholics]] were the majority in most of Ireland, [[Protestants]] were the majority in Ulster and in [[Great Britain]]. Many [[Ulster Protestants]] feared being governed by a [[Rome Rule|Catholic-dominated]] parliament in [[Dublin]] and losing their local supremacy and strong links with Britain.<ref>{{Cite book |title=A History of Ulster |last=Bardon |first=Jonathan |authorlink=Jonathan Bardon |year=1992 |publisher=Blackstaff Press |isbn=0856404985 |pages=402, 405}}</ref>\n\nThe two key figures in the creation of the Ulster Volunteers were [[Edward Carson, Baron Carson|Edward Carson]] (leader of the [[Irish Unionist Alliance]]) and [[James Craig, 1st Viscount Craigavon|James Craig]], supported ''[[sub rosa]]'' by figures such as [[Sir Henry Wilson, 1st Baronet|Henry Wilson]], Director of Military Operations at the [[British War Office]].

On 1 May 1919, the UVF was 'demobilised' when Richardson stood down as its [[General Officer Commanding]]. In Richardson's last orders to the UVF, he stated:<blockquote>Existing conditions call for the demobilisation of the Ulster Volunteers. The Force was organised, to protect the interests of the Province of Ulster, at a time when trouble threatened.

Its members refused to take their seats in the British Parliament and instead set up [[First D\u00e1il|their own parliament]] and [[Irish Declaration of Independence|declared independence for Ireland]]. The Irish Volunteers became the [[Irish Republican Army]] (IRA), the army of the self-declared [[Irish Republic]]. The [[Irish War of Independence]] began, fought between the IRA and the forces of the United Kingdom (which included the British Army and [[Royal Irish Constabulary]], RIC). The [[Government of Ireland Act 1920]] provided for two Home Rule parliaments: one for [[Northern Ireland]] and one for [[Southern Ireland (1921\u201322)|Southern Ireland]]. The unionist-dominated [[Parliament of Northern Ireland]] chose to remain a part of the United Kingdom.\n\nAs a response to IRA attacks within Ulster, the [[Ulster Unionist Council]] officially revived the UVF on 25 June 1920.<ref name=bowman192>Bowman, Timothy. ''Carson's Army: the Ulster Volunteer Force 1910\u201322''. p.192</ref> Many Unionists felt that the RIC, being mostly Roman Catholic, would not adequately protect Unionist areas. In early July, the UUC appointed [[Lieutenant Colonel]] [[Wilfrid Spender]] as the UVF's Officer Commanding.<ref name=bowman192/> At the same time, announcements were printed in unionist newspapers calling on all former UVF members to report for duty.<ref name=bowman192/> However, this call met with limited success; for example, each Belfast battalion drew little more than 100 men each and they were left mostly unarmed.<ref name=bowman192/> The UVF's revival also met with little backing from unionists in Great Britain.<ref name=bowman192/>\n\nDuring the conflict, loyalists set up small independent \"vigilance groups\" in many parts of Ulster. Most of these groups would patrol their areas and report anything untoward to the police (the RIC). Some of them, however, were armed with UVF rifles from 1914.<ref name=bowman190>Bowman, p.190</ref> There were also a number of small loyalist paramilitary groups, the most notable of which was the [[Ulster Imperial Guards]], who may have overreached the UVF in terms of membership.<ref name=bowman190/> Historian [[Peter Hart (historian)|Peter Hart]] wrote the following of these groups:<blockquote>Also occasionally targeted [by the IRA] were Ulster Protestants who saw the republican guerrilla campaign as an invasion of their territory, where they formed the majority. Loyalist activists responded by forming vigilante groups, which soon acquired official status as part of the Ulster Special Constabulary. These men spearheaded the wave of anti-Catholic violence that began in July 1920 and continued for two years. This onslaught was part of an Ulster Unionist counter-revolution, whose gunmen operated almost exclusively as ethnic cleansers and avengers.<ref>Peter Hart in, Joost Augusteijn (ed), ''The Irish Revolution'', p.25</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe sluggish recruitment to the UVF and its failure to stop IRA activities in Ulster prompted [[James Craig, 1st Viscount Craigavon|Sir James Craig]] to call for the formation of a new [[special constabulary]].<ref name=bowman195>Bowman, p.195</ref> In October 1920, the [[Ulster Special Constabulary]] (USC) was set up. This was an armed reserve police force whose main role, during 1920\u20131922, was to bolster the RIC and fight the IRA. Spender encouraged UVF members to join it. Many did so, although the USC did not engulf the bulk of the UVF (and other loyalist paramilitary groups) until early 1922.<ref name=bowman195/> Craig hoped to \"neutralise\" the loyalist paramilitaries by enrolling them in the C Division of the USC, a move that was backed by the British government.<ref>Bowman, p.198</ref> Historian Michael Hopkinson wrote that the USC, \"amounted to an officially approved UVF\".<ref>Hopkinson, ''Irish War of Independence'', p. 158</ref> The USC was almost wholly Protestant and was greatly mistrusted by Catholics and Irish nationalists.

The Ulster Volunteers were based in the northern [[Provinces of Ireland|province]] of [[Ulster]]. Many [[Ulster Protestants]] feared being governed by a [[Irish Catholic|Catholic]]-majority parliament in [[Dublin]] and losing their local governance and strong links with [[Great Britain]]. In 1913, the militias were organised into the '''Ulster Volunteer Force''' ('''UVF''') and vowed to resist any attempts by the British Government to impose Home Rule on Ulster. Later that year, [[Irish nationalism|Irish nationalists]] formed a rival militia, the [[Irish Volunteers]], to safeguard Home Rule. In April 1914, the UVF [[Larne gun-running|smuggled 25,000 rifles]] into Ulster. The [[Home Rule Crisis]] was halted by the outbreak of [[World War I]] in August 1914. Many UVF members enlisted with the [[British Army]]'s [[36th (Ulster) Division]] and went to fight on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]].\n\nAfter World War I, the British Government decided to set up two self-governing regions in Ireland: [[Northern Ireland]] (made up of six Ulster counties which overall had a Protestant/unionist majority) and [[Southern Ireland (1921\u201322)|Southern Ireland]]. However, by 1919 the [[Irish War of Independence]] was raging and the [[Irish Republican Army]] (IRA), the army of the self-declared [[Irish Republic]], was launching attacks on British forces in Ireland. As a response to these attacks, the UVF was revived. However, this revival was largely unsuccessful and the UVF was absorbed into the [[Ulster Special Constabulary]] (USC), the reserve police force of the [[Northern Ireland Government]].\n\nA [[Ulster loyalism|Loyalist paramilitary]] group calling itself the [[Ulster Volunteer Force]] was formed in 1966. It claims to be a direct descendant of the older organisation and uses the same logo, but there are no organisational links between the two.<ref>{{cite book |last=MacDermott |first=John |date=1979 |title=An Enriching Life |publisher=Privately published |page=42 |author-link=John MacDermott, Baron MacDermott}}</ref>\n\n==Before World War I==\nBy 1912, the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] (IPP), an [[Irish nationalism|Irish nationalist]] party which sought devolution ([[Home Rule]]) for [[Ireland]], held the balance of power in the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]. In April 1912, Prime Minister [[H. H. Asquith]] introduced the [[Government of Ireland Act 1914|third Home Rule Bill]]. Previous Home Rule Bills had fallen, the first rejected by the House of Commons, the second because of the veto power of the Tory-dominated [[House of Lords]], however since the crisis caused by the Lords' rejection of the \"[[People's Budget]]\" of 1909 and the subsequent passing of the [[Parliament Act 1911|Parliament Act]], the House of Lords had seen their powers to block legislation diminished and so it could be expected that this Bill would (eventually) become law. Home Rule was popular in all of Ireland apart from the northeast of Ulster. While [[Irish Catholic|Catholics]] were the majority in most of Ireland, [[Protestants]] were the majority in Ulster and in [[Great Britain]]. Many [[Ulster Protestants]] feared being governed by a [[Rome Rule|Catholic-dominated]] parliament in [[Dublin]] and losing their local supremacy and strong links with Britain.<ref>{{Cite book |title=A History of Ulster |last=Bardon |first=Jonathan |authorlink=Jonathan Bardon |year=1992 |publisher=Blackstaff Press |isbn=0856404985 |pages=402, 405}}</ref>\n\nThe two key figures in the creation of the Ulster Volunteers were [[Edward Carson, Baron Carson|Edward Carson]] (leader of the [[Irish Unionist Alliance]]) and [[James Craig, 1st Viscount Craigavon|James Craig]], supported ''[[sub rosa]]'' by figures such as [[Sir Henry Wilson, 1st Baronet|Henry Wilson]], Director of Military Operations at the [[British War Office]].

Peel's [[Metropolitan Police Act 1829]] established a full-time, professional and centrally-organised police force for the greater London area known as the [[Metropolitan Police]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Metropolitan Police|url=http://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/transformingsociety/laworder/policeprisons/overview/metropolitanpolice/|publisher=UK Parliament|accessdate=29 December 2013}}</ref> Legislation in the 1830s introduced policing in boroughs and many counties and, in the 1850s, policing was established nationally.\n\nThe [[Peelian Principles]] describe the philosophy that Sir Robert Peel developed to define an ethical police force. The principles traditionally ascribed to Peel state that:\n* Every police officer should be issued an [[Warrant card|identification number]], to assure accountability for his actions.\n* Whether the police are effective is not measured on the number of arrests, but on the lack of crime.\n* Above all else, an effective authority figure knows trust and accountability are paramount.  Hence, Peel's most often quoted principle that \"The police are the public and the public are the police.\"\n\n[[Peelian Principles#The Nine Principles of Policing|Nine principles of policing]] were set out in the \u2018General Instructions\u2019 issued to every new police officer in the Metropolitan Police from 1829.

A [[Police Complaints Board]] was set up to handle allegations of malpractice in response.\n\nChanges took place to tighten police procedures in the 1980s, in response to the [[Scarman Report]], to ensure that evidence and interviews were robust, in the introduction of the [[Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984]]. In 1989, the [[West Midlands Serious Crime Squad]] was disbanded as a series of around 100 criminal cases failed or were subsequently overturned in the West Midlands, after new forensic techniques showed police officers had been tampering with statement evidence to secure convictions, including those of the [[Birmingham Six]].\n\nThe Police Complaints Board was replaced by the [[Police Complaints Authority (United Kingdom)|Police Complaints Authority]] in 1985, which itself was superseded by the [[Independent Police Complaints Commission]] in 2004.

In England and Wales, the vast majority of [[Police Oath#United Kingdom|attested]] [[constables]] enjoy full powers of arrest and search as granted by the [[Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984]]. For the purposes of this legislation, \"constables\" is defined to mean all police officers, irrespective of [[Police ranks of the United Kingdom|rank]]. Although police officers have wide-ranging powers, they are still subject to the same laws as members of the public (aside from specific exemptions such as the carrying of firearms and certain road traffic legislation).  There are additional legal restrictions placed on police officers such as the prohibitions on industrial action and on taking part in active politics.\n\n===Types of law enforcement agency===\n{{Main|List of law enforcement agencies in the United Kingdom}}\nThere are three general types of law enforcement agency in the United Kingdom. The first is mostly concerned with policing the general public and their activities and the others are concerned with policing of more specific matters:\n\n* '''Territorial police services''', which carry out the majority of policing. There are 45 [[Territorial police force#United Kingdom|territorial police services]] {{As of|2013|lc=on}} that cover a [[police area]] (a particular region) and have an independent [[police authority]] (England and Wales) or local authority or joint [[police board]] (Scotland). The [[Police Act 1996]], the [[Police (Scotland) Act 1967]] and the [[Police (Northern Ireland) Act 2000]], prescribe a number of issues such as appointment of a [[chief constable]], and jurisdiction and responsibilities for police forces in England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland respectively. Since the introduction of [[Police and Crime Commissioner]]s in November 2012, the police services in England and Wales no longer have a police authority and this work is done by the police and crime prevention commissioners who are elected every four years. Certain territorial police services have units within them which have a national role, such the Specialist Operations directorate of the Metropolitan Police.\n* '''National law enforcement agencies''', including the [[National Crime Agency]] and [[British Transport Police]] (the latter only operates in Great Britain). The [[Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005]] refers to these as \"[[Special police force#United Kingdom|special police forces]]\". The National Crime Agency operates across the United Kingdom (but in Scotland or Northern Ireland requires the agreement of the domestic prosecuting authority to do so) against organised crime and acts as the UK point of contact for foreign agencies. There are also non-police law enforcement agencies whose officers, while not police constables, enforce laws such as the [[Serious Fraud Office (United Kingdom)|Serious Fraud Office]] and [[HM Revenue and Customs]].\n* '''Miscellaneous police services''', mostly having their foundations in older legislation or [[common law]]. These have a responsibility to police specific local areas or activities, such as ports and parks, and before the passing of recent legislation such as the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005 were often referred to as \"special police services\"; care must therefore be taken in interpreting historical use of that phrase. These constabularies are not within the scope of the legislation applicable to the previously mentioned organisations but can still be the subject of statutes applicable to, for example, docks, harbours or railways. Until the passing of [[Railways and Transport Safety Act 2003]], the British Transport Police was such a force.\n\nThe [[list of law enforcement agencies in the United Kingdom]] details the various services.\n\n===Cross-jurisdiction powers===\nTerritorial police constables have certain powers of arrest in another one of the [[Legal jurisdictions of the United Kingdom|UK's three legal jurisdictions]] than they were attested in. There are four main provisions for them to do so&nbsp;\u2013 arrest with a warrant, arrest without a warrant for an offence committed in their home jurisdiction whilst in another jurisdiction, arrest without a warrant for an offence committed in another jurisdiction whilst in that jurisdiction, and mutual aid.  A fifth power of cross jurisdictional arrest was introduced by section 116 of the [[Policing and Crime Act 2017]] which fills a loop hole in arrest powers in certain situations.  This power came into force in March 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/227/regulation/2/made/data.htm|title=The Policing and Crime Act 2017 (Commencement No. 7) Regulations 2018|website=www.legislation.gov.uk|access-date=2019-01-03}}</ref>  This new power allows a constable from one jurisdiction to arrest without warrant a person suspected of an offence in another jurisdiction whilst in their home jurisdiction.  This power is in relation to more serious offences as listed in the act.  The Act sets out how long the person can be detained in custody by the 'arresting force' in one jurisdiction until constables from the 'investigating force' in another jurisdiction can travel to re-arrest the person and deal accordingly.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2017/3/section/116?timeline=true|title=Policing and Crime Act 2017|website=www.legislation.gov.uk|language=en|others=Expert Participation|access-date=2017-12-22}}</ref>  Below is a summary of these five powers with a practical example due to the complicated nature of this area of law.  Note: this section applies to territorial police constables only, and not to others&nbsp;\u2013 except the British Transport Police, who also have [[British Transport Police#Cross-border powers|certain cross-border powers]] in addition to their natural powers.\n\n====Arrest with warrant====\nCertain warrants can be executed by constables even though they are outside their jurisdiction: [[arrest warrant]]s and [[Warrant of committal|warrants of committal]] (all); and a warrant to arrest a witness (England, Wales or Northern Ireland); a warrant for committal, a warrant to imprison (or to apprehend and imprison), and a warrant to arrest a witness (Scotland).<ref name=\"S136\">{{cite web|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?parentActiveTextDocId=2156203&activetextdocid=2156396 |title=section 136, Criminal Justice & Public Order Act 1994 |publisher=Statutelaw.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2017-01-16}}</ref> A warrant issued in one legal jurisdiction may be executed in either of the other two jurisdictions by a constable from either the jurisdiction where it was issued, or the jurisdiction where it is executed.<ref name=\"S136\"/>\n\nWhen executing a warrant issued in Scotland, the constable executing it shall have the same powers and duties, and the person arrested the same rights, as they would have had if execution had been in Scotland by a constable of a police force in Scotland.

As a practical example, if constables from [[Police Scotland]] are over the border in Cumbria on enquiries and come across a burglary in progress they can arrest the suspect on suspicion of burglary

In urgent and serious cases this caused several issues around delay and suspects evading capture.  This new power allows a constable of one jurisdiction to arrest without warrant a person suspected of an offence in another jurisdiction whilst in their home jurisdiction.  The Act sets out which offences this power of arrest will apply to in each jurisdiction (generally serious offences), and how long the person arrested can be kept in custody, with relevant authorities, by the 'arresting force' to allow sufficient time for officers from the 'investigating force' in another jurisdiction to travel and re-arrest the detained person for the purposes of their investigation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2017/3/section/116?timeline=true|title=Policing and Crime Act 2017|website=www.legislation.gov.uk|language=en|others=Expert Participation|access-date=2017-12-22}}</ref>\n\nAs a practical example of this power, a murder is committed in Aberdeen, Scotland.

A person must make a declaration before taking up office as a constable and having any powers; although this is sometimes still known as the [[police oath]], and the process sometimes referred to as \"swearing in\", it now takes the form of an \"attestation\" (in [[England and Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland]]) or a \"declaration\" (in [[Scotland]]). The process is carried out in the presence of a magistrate, and is usually followed by the issue of a warrant card. This grants the officer all the powers and privileges, duties and responsibilities of a constable in one of the three distinct legal systems - either England and Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland, and the territorial waters of that country.

As a result, they have the full powers of a constable on land owned by the harbour, dock, or port and at any place within one mile of any owned land. There are also forces created by specific legislation, such as the [[Port of Tilbury Police]] ([[Port of London Act 1968]]), [[Mersey Tunnels Police]] (County of Merseyside Act 1989) and the [[Epping Forest Keepers]] (Epping Forest Act 1878).\n\n====Parks Constables====\nUnder Article 18 of the Ministry of Housing and Local Government Provisional Order Confirmation (Greater London Parks and Open Spaces) Act 1967, [[London Borough Council]]s are allowed to swear in council officers as constables for \"securing the observance of the provisions of all enactments relating to open spaces under their control or management and of bye-laws and regulations made thereunder\". Local Authority Parks Constables have all the powers of a constable in relation byelaws regulations and all enactments relating to open spaces, Article 19 of the Act was repealed by section 26(1) of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (Local Acts) and the power of arrest for Parks Constables is now contained in Section 24 of P.A.C.E 1984, further amendments to Article 19 covering coming to the aid and assistance of such a constable or officer were repealed by SOCPA 2005, as this provision is already covered in P.A.C.E 1984 (Legal Counsel 2007,2012).\nNo enforcement agency with a power of arrest or detention can operate outside of the provisions of P.A.C.E 1984; therefore all local powers of arrest and detention were brought into line under section 26(1) P.A.C.E 1984.\n\n===Police staff===\nPolice forces employ staff who perform many functions to assist officers and support the smooth running of their police force. They do not hold the office of constable.\nIn England & Wales, the [[chief police officer]] of a territorial police force may designate any person who is employed by the police authority maintaining that force, and is under the direction and control of that chief police officer, as one or more of the following:\n*[[Police Community Support Officer]]\n*Investigating Officer,\n*[[Custody assistant|detention officer]], or\n*Escort Officer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=All+Legislation&searchEnacted=0&extentMatchOnly=0&confersPower=0&blanketAmendment=0&sortAlpha=0&PageNumber=0&NavFrom=0&parentActiveTextDocId=112639&ActiveTextDocId=112693&filesize=53565 |title=Police Reform Act 2002 (c. 30) - Statute Law Database |publisher=Statutelaw.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-05-06}}</ref>\nThey have a range of powers given by the [[Police Reform Act 2002]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=All+Legislation&searchEnacted=0&extentMatchOnly=0&confersPower=0&blanketAmendment=0&sortAlpha=0&PageNumber=0&NavFrom=0&parentActiveTextDocId=112639&ActiveTextDocId=112842&filesize=2720 |title=Police Reform Act 2002 (c. 30) - Statute Law Database |publisher=Statutelaw.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-05-06}}</ref> and their chief police officer decides which of these powers they may use. Unlike a police constable, a PCSO only has powers when on duty and in uniform, and within the area policed by their respective force.\n\nUntil 1991, parking enforcement was primarily conducted by police-employed [[traffic warden]]s. Since the passage of the Road Traffic Act 1991, [[decriminalised parking enforcement]] has enabled local authorities to take on this role and now very few forces still employ Police Traffic Wardens, these include the Metropolitan Police Service however they have combined the role with PCSOs as ''Traffic Police Community Support Officers''.\n\nIn Scotland, [[Police Custody and Security Officer]]s have powers similar to those of detention officers and escort officers in England and Wales.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oqps.gov.uk/legislation/acts/acts2003/asp_20030007_en_13#pt12-pb1-l1g76 |title=Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 2003 (asp 7) |publisher=Oqps.gov.uk |date=2008-12-31 |accessdate=2009-05-06}}</ref> Similar powers are available in Northern Ireland.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=Act+(UK+Public+General)&title=Northern+Ireland&searchEnacted=0&extentMatchOnly=0&confersPower=0&blanketAmendment=0&sortAlpha=0&TYPE=QS&PageNumber=1&NavFrom=0&parentActiveTextDocId=814668&ActiveTextDocId=814749&filesize=1903 |title=Police (Northern Ireland) Act 2003 (c. 6) - Statute Law Database |publisher=Statutelaw.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-05-06}}</ref>\n\n===Accredited Persons===\n[[Chief police officer]]s of territorial police forces<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=All+Legislation&searchEnacted=0&extentMatchOnly=0&confersPower=0&blanketAmendment=0&sortAlpha=0&PageNumber=0&NavFrom=0&parentActiveTextDocId=112639&ActiveTextDocId=112697&filesize=4936 |title=Police Reform Act 2002 (c. 30) - Statute Law Database |publisher=Statutelaw.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-05-06}}</ref> (and the British Transport Police<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=All+Legislation&searchEnacted=0&extentMatchOnly=0&confersPower=0&blanketAmendment=0&sortAlpha=0&PageNumber=0&NavFrom=0&parentActiveTextDocId=112639&ActiveTextDocId=112699&filesize=6329 |title=Police Reform Act 2002 (c. 30) - Statute Law Database |publisher=Statutelaw.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-05-06}}</ref>) can also give limited powers<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=All+Legislation&searchEnacted=0&extentMatchOnly=0&confersPower=0&blanketAmendment=0&sortAlpha=0&PageNumber=0&NavFrom=0&parentActiveTextDocId=112639&ActiveTextDocId=112884&filesize=641 |title=Police Reform Act 2002 (c. 30) - Statute Law Database |publisher=Statutelaw.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-05-06}}</ref> to people not employed by the police authority, under [[Community Safety Accreditation Scheme]]s.

These forces operate across the United Kingdom and their responsibility is to the specific activities they were established to police.\n\n[[File:police.boat.at.poole.arp.jpg|thumb|right|Police harbour patrol boat in [[Poole Harbour]], [[Dorset]]]]\n\n===Her Majesty's Inspectorates of Constabulary ===\n[[Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary|Her Majesty's Inspectorates of Constabulary]] (HMIC) are the official bodies responsible for the examination and assessment of police forces to ensure their requirements are met as intended.\n\nThere are two similarly named organisations:\n*'''Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire & Rescue Services''' (HMICFRS) - this organisation is responsible to the [[Home Office]] for police forces in England and Wales. It also inspects, by invitation, various UK [[special police force]]s and elements of the Service (Military) Police. Since 2004, HMIC has also had responsibility for examining [[HM Revenue and Customs]] and the [[Serious Organised Crime Agency]]. Inspection services have been provided on a non-statutory basis for the [[Police Service of Northern Ireland]].  Since July 2017 it has also become responsible for inspecting Fire & Rescue Services in England.\n*'''Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary for Scotland''' (commonly known as HMICS) - this organisation is responsible to the [[Scottish Government]] and examines the [[Police Service of Scotland]] and the [[Scottish Police Authority]].\n\n===Crown dependencies and overseas territories===\nThe [[Crown dependencies]] and [[British overseas territories]] have their own police forces, the majority of which use the British model. Because they are not part of the United Kingdom, they are not answerable to the British Government; instead they are organised by and are responsible to their own governments (an exception to this is the [[Sovereign Base Areas Police]]; as the SBAs' existence is solely for the benefit of the British armed forces and do not have full overseas territory status, the SBA Police are responsible to the Ministry of Defence). Because they are based on the British model of policing, these police forces conform to the standards set out by the British government, which includes voluntarily submitting themselves to inspection by the HMIC. Their vehicles share similarities with the vehicles owned by forces based in the UK, such as the use of [[Battenburg markings]].\n\n'''List of British Overseas Territories Police Services/Forces:'''\n\nThe fourteen British Overseas Territories are:<ref name=\"collections.europarchive.org\">{{cite web |url=http://www.fco.gov.uk/servlet/Front%3fpagename=OpenMarket/Xcelerate/ShowPage&c=Page&cid=1013618138295 |title=Overseas Territories |publisher=UK Overseas Territories Foreign & Commonwealth Office |accessdate=8 December 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68e5D4Buo?url=http://collections.europarchive.org/tna/20080205132101/www.fco.gov.uk/servlet/Front?pagename=OpenMarket%2FXcelerate%2FShowPage&c=Page&cid=1013618138295 |archivedate=23 June 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! class=\"unsortable\"| Flag\n! class=\"unsortable\"| Arms\n!

These officers are generally the most visible and will invariably be the first interface a member of the public has with police. In general terms these officers will normally patrol by vehicle (though also on foot or bicycle in urban areas). They will generally patrol a sub-division or whole division of a police force area or in the case of the Metropolitan Police Service, a borough. Nearly all police officers begin their careers in this area of policing, with some moving on to more specialist roles. The Metropolitan Police Service calls this area of policing 'Response Teams', whilst other forces use terms such as 'patrol', 'section' and other variations.\n* Most local areas or wards in the country have at least one police officer who is involved in trying to build links with the local community and resolve long-term problems. In London, the Metropolitan Police Service addresses this area of policing with Safer Neighbourhood Teams. This entails each political ward in London having a Police Sergeant, two police constables and a few PCSOs who are ring fenced to address problems and build community links in their respective wards. Other police forces have similar systems but can be named 'Area officers', 'Neighbourhood officers', 'Beat Constables' and a number of other variations.\n* Criminal Investigation Departments (CID) can be found in all police forces. Generally these officers deal with investigations of a more complex, serious nature, however this again can differ from force to force.  Most officers within this area are detectives. Depending on the force in question this area of policing can be further divided into a myriad of other specialist areas such as fraud.  Smaller forces tend to have detectives who deal with a wide range of varied investigations whereas detectives in larger forces can have a very specialist remit.\n* All police forces have specialist departments that deal with certain aspects of policing. Larger forces such as Greater Manchester Police, Strathclyde Police and West Midlands Police have many and varied departments and units such as traffic, firearms, marine, horse, tactical support all named differently depending on the force.  Smaller forces such Dyfed Powys Police and Warwickshire Police will have fewer specialists and will rely on cross training, such as firearms officers also being traffic trained officers. The Metropolitan Police, the largest force in the country, has a large number of specialist departments, some of which are unique to the Metropolitan Police due to policing the capital and its national responsibilities. For example, the [[Diplomatic Protection Group]] and [[Counter Terrorism Command]].\n\n====Fixated Threat Assessment Centre====\n{{main|Fixated Threat Assessment Centre}}\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Fixated Threat Assessment Centre]] is a joint police/mental health unit set up in October 2006 by the [[Home Office]], the [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|Department of Health]] and [[Metropolitan Police Service]] to identify and address those individuals considered to pose a threat to VIPs or the Royal Family.\n<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/crime/article1847697.ece|publisher=The Times|title=VIP 'stalker' squad set up by government|author=Joanna Bale|date=May 27, 2007 | location=London}}</ref> They may then be referred to local health services for further assessment and potential [[involuntary commitment]]. In some cases, they may be detained by police under the [[Mental Health Act 1983#Civil sections|section 136 powers]] of the [[Mental Health Act 1983]] prior to referral.\n\n====Border Force====\n:''See also: [[UK Visas and Immigration]], previously [[UK Border Agency]]''\nAs part of the wide-ranging review of the Home Office, the then Home Secretary, [[John Reid, Baron Reid of Cardowan|John Reid]], announced in July 2006 that all British immigration officers would be uniformed. On 1 April 2007 the [[Border and Immigration Agency]] (BIA) was created and commenced operation. However, there were no police officers in the Agency, a matter that attracted considerable criticism when the Agency was established - agency officers have limited powers of arrest.

In 2015 a public inquiry under a senior judge was announced. In November 2015 the Metropolitan Police published an unreserved apology in which it exonerated and apologized to those women who had been deceived and stated the methodology had constituted abuse and a \"gross violation\" with severely harmful effects, as part of a settlement of their cases.

Neighbourhood policing is important in dealing with terrorism and gang crime, especially in communities where the police are distrusted.  [[Yvette Cooper]] said the police were, \"performing a remarkable public service in increasingly difficult circumstances\" though they were, \"badly overstretched\" and responding with difficulty to increasing challenges like online fraud and online child abuse. Only a very small proportion of online fraud cases are investigated and the police are, \"woefully under-resourced\" for the number of online child sexual abuse investigations they must undertake.  Che Donald of the Police Federation of England and Wales said the government should acknowledge the, \"true cost of policing\" or officers would be unable to keep the public safe.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-45970761 Overstretched police risk becoming 'irrelevant', MPs warn] ''[[BBC]]''</ref>\n\n===Police sex abuse allegations===\nIn 2016, allegations of serious [[sexual abuse]] were made against hundreds of police officers in England and Wales, with several forces in England and Wales receiving 436 allegations of abuse of power for sexual gain against 436 police officers, including 20 [[police community support officer]]s and eight staff in the two years to March 2016.<ref name=hundreds>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/12/08/hundreds-police-reprieved-sex-abuse-claims-forces-fail-take/|title=Hundreds of police officers 'getting away with sexual abuse of crime victims'|work=telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=11 December 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/dec/08/hundreds-police-officers-accused-sex-abuse-inquiry-finds|title=Hundreds of police in England and Wales accused of sexual abuse|first=Jamie|last=Grierson|date=8 December 2016|publisher=|accessdate=11 December 2016|via=The Guardian}}</ref> Mike Cunningham, inspector of constabulary and former chief constable of Staffordshire police said: \u201cIt's the most serious form of corruption.

Peel's [[Metropolitan Police Act 1829]] established a full-time, professional and centrally-organised police force for the greater London area known as the [[Metropolitan Police]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Metropolitan Police|url=http://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/transformingsociety/laworder/policeprisons/overview/metropolitanpolice/|publisher=UK Parliament|accessdate=29 December 2013}}</ref> Legislation in the 1830s introduced policing in boroughs and many counties and, in the 1850s, policing was established nationally.\n\nThe [[Peelian Principles]] describe the philosophy that Sir Robert Peel developed to define an ethical police force. The principles traditionally ascribed to Peel state that:\n* Every police officer should be issued an [[Warrant card|identification number]], to assure accountability for his actions.\n* Whether the police are effective is not measured on the number of arrests, but on the lack of crime.\n* Above all else, an effective authority figure knows trust and accountability are paramount.  Hence, Peel's most often quoted principle that \"The police are the public and the public are the police.\"\n\n[[Peelian Principles#The Nine Principles of Policing|Nine principles of policing]] were set out in the \u2018General Instructions\u2019 issued to every new police officer in the Metropolitan Police from 1829.

A [[Police Complaints Board]] was set up to handle allegations of malpractice in response.\n\nChanges took place to tighten police procedures in the 1980s, in response to the [[Scarman Report]], to ensure that evidence and interviews were robust, in the introduction of the [[Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984]]. In 1989, the [[West Midlands Serious Crime Squad]] was disbanded as a series of around 100 criminal cases failed or were subsequently overturned in the West Midlands, after new forensic techniques showed police officers had been tampering with statement evidence to secure convictions, including those of the [[Birmingham Six]].\n\nThe Police Complaints Board was replaced by the [[Police Complaints Authority (United Kingdom)|Police Complaints Authority]] in 1985, which itself was superseded by the [[Independent Police Complaints Commission]] in 2004.

In England and Wales, the vast majority of [[Police Oath#United Kingdom|attested]] [[constables]] enjoy full powers of arrest and search as granted by the [[Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984]]. For the purposes of this legislation, \"constables\" is defined to mean all police officers, irrespective of [[Police ranks of the United Kingdom|rank]]. Although police officers have wide-ranging powers, they are still subject to the same laws as members of the public (aside from specific exemptions such as the carrying of firearms and certain road traffic legislation).  There are additional legal restrictions placed on police officers such as the prohibitions on industrial action and on taking part in active politics.\n\n===Types of law enforcement agency===\n{{Main|List of law enforcement agencies in the United Kingdom}}\nThere are three general types of law enforcement agency in the United Kingdom. The first is mostly concerned with policing the general public and their activities and the others are concerned with policing of more specific matters:\n\n* '''Territorial police services''', which carry out the majority of policing. There are 45 [[Territorial police force#United Kingdom|territorial police services]] {{As of|2013|lc=on}} that cover a [[police area]] (a particular region) and have an independent [[police authority]] (England and Wales) or local authority or joint [[police board]] (Scotland). The [[Police Act 1996]], the [[Police (Scotland) Act 1967]] and the [[Police (Northern Ireland) Act 2000]], prescribe a number of issues such as appointment of a [[chief constable]], and jurisdiction and responsibilities for police forces in England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland respectively. Since the introduction of [[Police and Crime Commissioner]]s in November 2012, the police services in England and Wales no longer have a police authority and this work is done by the police and crime prevention commissioners who are elected every four years. Certain territorial police services have units within them which have a national role, such the Specialist Operations directorate of the Metropolitan Police.\n* '''National law enforcement agencies''', including the [[National Crime Agency]] and [[British Transport Police]] (the latter only operates in Great Britain). The [[Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005]] refers to these as \"[[Special police force#United Kingdom|special police forces]]\". The National Crime Agency operates across the United Kingdom (but in Scotland or Northern Ireland requires the agreement of the domestic prosecuting authority to do so) against organised crime and acts as the UK point of contact for foreign agencies. There are also non-police law enforcement agencies whose officers, while not police constables, enforce laws such as the [[Serious Fraud Office (United Kingdom)|Serious Fraud Office]] and [[HM Revenue and Customs]].\n* '''Miscellaneous police services''', mostly having their foundations in older legislation or [[common law]]. These have a responsibility to police specific local areas or activities, such as ports and parks, and before the passing of recent legislation such as the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005 were often referred to as \"special police services\"; care must therefore be taken in interpreting historical use of that phrase. These constabularies are not within the scope of the legislation applicable to the previously mentioned organisations but can still be the subject of statutes applicable to, for example, docks, harbours or railways. Until the passing of [[Railways and Transport Safety Act 2003]], the British Transport Police was such a force.\n\nThe [[list of law enforcement agencies in the United Kingdom]] details the various services.\n\n===Cross-jurisdiction powers===\nTerritorial police constables have certain powers of arrest in another one of the [[Legal jurisdictions of the United Kingdom|UK's three legal jurisdictions]] than they were attested in. There are four main provisions for them to do so&nbsp;\u2013 arrest with a warrant, arrest without a warrant for an offence committed in their home jurisdiction whilst in another jurisdiction, arrest without a warrant for an offence committed in another jurisdiction whilst in that jurisdiction, and mutual aid.  A fifth power of cross jurisdictional arrest was introduced by section 116 of the [[Policing and Crime Act 2017]] which fills a loop hole in arrest powers in certain situations.  This power came into force in March 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/227/regulation/2/made/data.htm|title=The Policing and Crime Act 2017 (Commencement No. 7) Regulations 2018|website=www.legislation.gov.uk|access-date=2019-01-03}}</ref>  This new power allows a constable from one jurisdiction to arrest without warrant a person suspected of an offence in another jurisdiction whilst in their home jurisdiction.  This power is in relation to more serious offences as listed in the act.  The Act sets out how long the person can be detained in custody by the 'arresting force' in one jurisdiction until constables from the 'investigating force' in another jurisdiction can travel to re-arrest the person and deal accordingly.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2017/3/section/116?timeline=true|title=Policing and Crime Act 2017|website=www.legislation.gov.uk|language=en|others=Expert Participation|access-date=2017-12-22}}</ref>  Below is a summary of these five powers with a practical example due to the complicated nature of this area of law.  Note: this section applies to territorial police constables only, and not to others&nbsp;\u2013 except the British Transport Police, who also have [[British Transport Police#Cross-border powers|certain cross-border powers]] in addition to their natural powers.\n\n====Arrest with warrant====\nCertain warrants can be executed by constables even though they are outside their jurisdiction: [[arrest warrant]]s and [[Warrant of committal|warrants of committal]] (all); and a warrant to arrest a witness (England, Wales or Northern Ireland); a warrant for committal, a warrant to imprison (or to apprehend and imprison), and a warrant to arrest a witness (Scotland).<ref name=\"S136\">{{cite web|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?parentActiveTextDocId=2156203&activetextdocid=2156396 |title=section 136, Criminal Justice & Public Order Act 1994 |publisher=Statutelaw.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2017-01-16}}</ref> A warrant issued in one legal jurisdiction may be executed in either of the other two jurisdictions by a constable from either the jurisdiction where it was issued, or the jurisdiction where it is executed.<ref name=\"S136\"/>\n\nWhen executing a warrant issued in Scotland, the constable executing it shall have the same powers and duties, and the person arrested the same rights, as they would have had if execution had been in Scotland by a constable of a police force in Scotland.

relatively new power was introduced by the Policing and Crime Act 2017 and came into force in March 2018.<ref>{{Cite

2018|website=www.legislation.gov.uk|access-date=2019-01-03}}</ref>  Until  the introduction of this power, there was an issue whereby a constable in his home jurisdiction could not arrest a person suspected of an offence in another jurisdiction without a warrant.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/537277/Factsheet_14b_-_Cross-border_powers.pdf|title=Factsheet 14b - Policing and Crime Bill|last=|first=|date=|website=www.gov.uk|access-date=}}</ref>  Practically this meant that either a warrant had to be applied for, or constables from the investigating force have to travel to the jurisdiction where the person suspected was believed to be, to arrest under the cross border powers set out above.  In urgent and serious cases this caused several issues around delay and suspects evading capture.  This new power allows a constable of one jurisdiction to arrest without warrant a person suspected of an offence in another jurisdiction whilst in their home jurisdiction.  The Act sets out which offences this power of arrest will apply to in each jurisdiction (generally serious offences), and how long the person arrested can be kept in custody, with relevant authorities, by the 'arresting force' to allow sufficient time for officers from the 'investigating force' in another jurisdiction to travel and re-arrest the detained person for the purposes of their investigation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2017/3/section/116?timeline=true|title=Policing and Crime Act 2017|website=www.legislation.gov.uk|language=en|others=Expert Participation|access-date=2017-12-22}}</ref>\n\nAs a practical example of this power, a murder is committed in Aberdeen, Scotland.  The suspect immediately travels south over the border into England and is found by constables of [[Cumbria Police]] in Carlisle.  These constables would have a power of arrest in relation to the homicide that occurred in Scotland without the need to have a warrant.\n\n====Other situations (including Mutual Aid)====\nPolice forces often support each other with large-scale operations, such as those that require specialist skills or expertise and those that require policing levels that the host-forces cannot provide. Referred to as mutual aid, constables loaned from one force to another have the powers and privileges of a constable of the host force.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/ACTS/acts1996/ukpga_19960016_en_6#pt5-pb3-l1g98 |title=section 98, Police Act 1996 |publisher=Opsi.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-05-06}}</ref> Constables from the [[Metropolitan Police]] who are on protection duties in Scotland or Northern Ireland have all the powers and privileges of a constable of the host police force.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/ACTS/acts1996/ukpga_19960016_en_6#pt5-pb3-l1g99 |title=section 99, Police Act 1996 |publisher=Opsi.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-05-06}}</ref> A constable who is taking a person to or from a [[prison]] retains all the powers, authority, protection and privileges of his office regardless of his location.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?parentActiveTextDocId=553765&ActiveTextDocId=553798 |title=section 23, Prison Act 1952 |publisher=Statutelaw.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-05-28}}</ref> Regardless of where they are in the United Kingdom, a constable may arrest under section 41<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?parentActiveTextDocId=1851852&ActiveTextDocId=1851913 |title=Terrorism Act 2000 |publisher=Statutelaw.gov.uk |date=2011-05-27 |accessdate=2012-11-07}}</ref> and may stop and search under section 43<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?parentActiveTextDocId=1851852&ActiveTextDocId=1851915 |title=Terrorism Act 2000 |publisher=Statutelaw.gov.uk |date=2003-01-04 |accessdate=2012-11-07}}</ref> of the [[Terrorism Act 2000]] on suspicion of terrorism (defined by section 40<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?parentActiveTextDocId=1851852&ActiveTextDocId=1851912|title=Terrorism Act 2000|work=statutelaw.gov.uk|accessdate=11 December 2016}}</ref>).\n\n==Powers of officers==\n\n===Territorial police constables===\n[[File:Merseyside and Metropolitan Police officers.JPG|thumb|An officer of the [[Metropolitan Police Service|Metropolitan Police]] with an officer of [[Merseyside Police]] during a Football match between [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] and [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham]] at [[Goodison Park]]]]\n[[File:Greater Manchester Police officers in Piccadilly Gardens (Manchester, England) 2.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Police Constables and an Inspector of [[Greater Manchester Police]] on the beat in [[Manchester city centre]] after the [[2008 UEFA Cup Final Riots]]]]\nMost police officers are members of [[territorial police forces]]. A person must make a declaration before taking up office as a constable and having any powers; although this is sometimes still known as the [[police oath]], and the process sometimes referred to as \"swearing in\", it now takes the form of an \"attestation\" (in [[England and Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland]]) or a \"declaration\" (in [[Scotland]]). The process is carried out in the presence of a magistrate, and is usually followed by the issue of a warrant card. This grants the officer all the powers and privileges, duties and responsibilities of a constable in one of the three distinct legal systems - either England and Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland, and the territorial waters of that country. The limited circumstances where their powers extend across the border are described in the section above.\n\n===Other constables===\nThere are many constables who are not members of territorial police forces. The most notable are members of the three forces referred to as [[special police forces]]: the [[British Transport Police]], [[Ministry of Defence Police]] and [[Civil Nuclear Constabulary]]. Such officers have the \"powers and privileges of a constable\" in matters relating to their work.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2003/ukpga_20030020_en_3#pt3-pb3-l1g31 |title=Railways and Transport Safety Act 2003 (c. 20) |publisher=Opsi.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-05-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=All+Legislation&title=Energy+Act+2004&searchEnacted=0&extentMatchOnly=0&confersPower=0&blanketAmendment=0&sortAlpha=0&TYPE=QS&PageNumber=1&NavFrom=0&parentActiveTextDocId=913408&ActiveTextDocId=913486&filesize=6709 |title=Energy Act 2004 (c. 20) - Statute Law Database |publisher=Statutelaw.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-05-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=All+Legislation&title=ministry+police+act&searchEnacted=0&extentMatchOnly=0&confersPower=0&blanketAmendment=0&sortAlpha=0&TYPE=QS&PageNumber=1&NavFrom=0&parentActiveTextDocId=602920&ActiveTextDocId=602920&filesize=86516 |title=Ministry of Defence Police Act 1987 (c. 4) - Statute Law Database |publisher=Statutelaw.gov.uk |date=1987-03-05 |accessdate=2009-05-06}}</ref> BTP and MDP officers have additional jurisdiction where requested by a constable of another force, in which case they take on that constable's jurisdiction.<ref name=\"statutelaw.gov.uk\">{{cite web|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=All+Legislation&title=Anti-terrorism%2c+Crime+and+Security+Act+2001&searchEnacted=0&extentMatchOnly=0&confersPower=0&blanketAmendment=0&sortAlpha=0&TYPE=QS&PageNumber=1&NavFrom=0&parentActiveTextDocId=267726&ActiveTextDocId=267854&filesize=5059 |title=Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001 (c.24) - Statute Law Database |publisher=Statutelaw.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-05-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=All+Legislation&title=ministry+police+act&searchEnacted=0&extentMatchOnly=0&confersPower=0&blanketAmendment=0&sortAlpha=0&TYPE=QS&PageNumber=1&NavFrom=0&parentActiveTextDocId=602920&ActiveTextDocId=602925&filesize=3566 |title=Ministry of Defence Police Act 1987 (c. 4) - Statute Law Database |publisher=Statutelaw.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-05-06}}</ref> Upon request from the [[chief police officer]] of a police force, members of one of the above three forces can be given the full powers of constables in the police area of the requesting force.<ref name=\"statutelaw.gov.uk\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=All+Legislation&title=Anti-terrorism%2c+Crime+and+Security+Act+2001&searchEnacted=0&extentMatchOnly=0&confersPower=0&blanketAmendment=0&sortAlpha=0&TYPE=QS&PageNumber=1&NavFrom=0&parentActiveTextDocId=267726&ActiveTextDocId=267853&filesize=8435 |title=Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001 (c.24) - Statute Law Database |publisher=Statutelaw.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-05-06}}</ref> This was used to supplement police numbers in the areas surrounding the [[2005 G8 summit]] at Gleneagles.\n\nMany acts allow companies or councils to employ constables for a specific purpose.

As a result, they have the full powers of a constable on land owned by the harbour, dock, or port and at any place within one mile of any owned land. There are also forces created by specific legislation, such as the [[Port of Tilbury Police]] ([[Port of London Act 1968]]), [[Mersey Tunnels Police]] (County of Merseyside Act 1989) and the [[Epping Forest Keepers]] (Epping Forest Act 1878).\n\n====Parks Constables====\nUnder Article 18 of the Ministry of Housing and Local Government Provisional Order Confirmation (Greater London Parks and Open Spaces) Act 1967, [[London Borough Council]]s are allowed to swear in council officers as constables for \"securing the observance of the provisions of all enactments relating to open spaces under their control or management and of bye-laws and regulations made thereunder\". Local Authority Parks Constables have all the powers of a constable in relation byelaws regulations and all enactments relating to open spaces, Article 19 of the Act was repealed by section 26(1) of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (Local Acts) and the power of arrest for Parks Constables is now contained in Section 24 of P.A.C.E 1984, further amendments to Article 19 covering coming to the aid and assistance of such a constable or officer were repealed by SOCPA 2005, as this provision is already covered in P.A.C.E 1984 (Legal Counsel 2007,2012).\nNo enforcement agency with a power of arrest or detention can operate outside of the provisions of P.A.C.E 1984; therefore all local powers of arrest and detention were brought into line under section 26(1) P.A.C.E 1984.\n\n===Police staff===\nPolice forces employ staff who perform many functions to assist officers and support the smooth running of their police force. They do not hold the office of constable.\nIn England & Wales, the [[chief police officer]] of a territorial police force may designate any person who is employed by the police authority maintaining that force, and is under the direction and control of that chief police officer, as one or more of the following:\n*[[Police Community Support Officer]]\n*Investigating Officer,\n*[[Custody assistant|detention officer]], or\n*Escort Officer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=All+Legislation&searchEnacted=0&extentMatchOnly=0&confersPower=0&blanketAmendment=0&sortAlpha=0&PageNumber=0&NavFrom=0&parentActiveTextDocId=112639&ActiveTextDocId=112693&filesize=53565 |title=Police Reform Act 2002 (c. 30) - Statute Law Database |publisher=Statutelaw.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-05-06}}</ref>\nThey have a range of powers given by the [[Police Reform Act 2002]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=All+Legislation&searchEnacted=0&extentMatchOnly=0&confersPower=0&blanketAmendment=0&sortAlpha=0&PageNumber=0&NavFrom=0&parentActiveTextDocId=112639&ActiveTextDocId=112842&filesize=2720 |title=Police Reform Act 2002 (c. 30) - Statute Law Database |publisher=Statutelaw.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-05-06}}</ref> and their chief police officer decides which of these powers they may use. Unlike a police constable, a PCSO only has powers when on duty and in uniform, and within the area policed by their respective force.\n\nUntil 1991, parking enforcement was primarily conducted by police-employed [[traffic warden]]s. Since the passage of the Road Traffic Act 1991, [[decriminalised parking enforcement]] has enabled local authorities to take on this role and now very few forces still employ Police Traffic Wardens, these include the Metropolitan Police Service however they have combined the role with PCSOs as ''Traffic Police Community Support Officers''.\n\nIn Scotland, [[Police Custody and Security Officer]]s have powers similar to those of detention officers and escort officers in England and Wales.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oqps.gov.uk/legislation/acts/acts2003/asp_20030007_en_13#pt12-pb1-l1g76 |title=Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 2003 (asp 7) |publisher=Oqps.gov.uk |date=2008-12-31 |accessdate=2009-05-06}}</ref> Similar powers are available in Northern Ireland.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=Act+(UK+Public+General)&title=Northern+Ireland&searchEnacted=0&extentMatchOnly=0&confersPower=0&blanketAmendment=0&sortAlpha=0&TYPE=QS&PageNumber=1&NavFrom=0&parentActiveTextDocId=814668&ActiveTextDocId=814749&filesize=1903 |title=Police (Northern Ireland) Act 2003 (c. 6) - Statute Law Database |publisher=Statutelaw.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-05-06}}</ref>\n\n===Accredited Persons===\n[[Chief police officer]]s of territorial police forces<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=All+Legislation&searchEnacted=0&extentMatchOnly=0&confersPower=0&blanketAmendment=0&sortAlpha=0&PageNumber=0&NavFrom=0&parentActiveTextDocId=112639&ActiveTextDocId=112697&filesize=4936 |title=Police Reform Act 2002 (c. 30) - Statute Law Database |publisher=Statutelaw.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-05-06}}</ref> (and the British Transport Police<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=All+Legislation&searchEnacted=0&extentMatchOnly=0&confersPower=0&blanketAmendment=0&sortAlpha=0&PageNumber=0&NavFrom=0&parentActiveTextDocId=112639&ActiveTextDocId=112699&filesize=6329 |title=Police Reform Act 2002 (c. 30) - Statute Law Database |publisher=Statutelaw.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-05-06}}</ref>) can also give limited powers<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=All+Legislation&searchEnacted=0&extentMatchOnly=0&confersPower=0&blanketAmendment=0&sortAlpha=0&PageNumber=0&NavFrom=0&parentActiveTextDocId=112639&ActiveTextDocId=112884&filesize=641 |title=Police Reform Act 2002 (c. 30) - Statute Law Database |publisher=Statutelaw.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-05-06}}</ref> to people not employed by the police authority, under [[Community Safety Accreditation Scheme]]s.

Because they are based on the British model of policing, these police forces conform to the standards set out by the British government, which includes voluntarily submitting themselves to inspection by the HMIC.

These officers are generally the most visible and will invariably be the first interface a member of the public has with police. In general terms these officers will normally patrol by vehicle (though also on foot or bicycle in urban areas). They will generally patrol a sub-division or whole division of a police force area or in the case of the Metropolitan Police Service, a borough. Nearly all police officers begin their careers in this area of policing, with some moving on to more specialist roles. The Metropolitan Police Service calls this area of policing 'Response Teams', whilst other forces use terms such as 'patrol', 'section' and other variations.\n* Most local areas or wards in the country have at least one police officer who is involved in trying to build links with the local community and resolve long-term problems. In London, the Metropolitan Police Service addresses this area of policing with Safer Neighbourhood Teams. This entails each political ward in London having a Police Sergeant, two police constables and a few PCSOs who are ring fenced to address problems and build community links in their respective wards. Other police forces have similar systems but can be named 'Area officers', 'Neighbourhood officers', 'Beat Constables' and a number of other variations.\n* Criminal Investigation Departments (CID) can be found in all police forces. Generally these officers deal with investigations of a more complex, serious nature, however this again can differ from force to force.  Most officers within this area are detectives. Depending on the force in question this area of policing can be further divided into a myriad of other specialist areas such as fraud.  Smaller forces tend to have detectives who deal with a wide range of varied investigations whereas detectives in larger forces can have a very specialist remit.\n* All police forces have specialist departments that deal with certain aspects of policing. Larger forces such as Greater Manchester Police, Strathclyde Police and West Midlands Police have many and varied departments and units such as traffic, firearms, marine, horse, tactical support all named differently depending on the force.  Smaller forces such Dyfed Powys Police and Warwickshire Police will have fewer specialists and will rely on cross training, such as firearms officers also being traffic trained officers. The Metropolitan Police, the largest force in the country, has a large number of specialist departments, some of which are unique to the Metropolitan Police due to policing the capital and its national responsibilities. For example, the [[Diplomatic Protection Group]] and [[Counter Terrorism Command]].\n\n====Fixated Threat Assessment Centre====\n{{main|Fixated Threat Assessment Centre}}\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Fixated Threat Assessment Centre]] is a joint police/mental health unit set up in October 2006 by the [[Home Office]], the [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|Department of Health]] and [[Metropolitan Police Service]] to identify and address those individuals considered to pose a threat to VIPs or the Royal Family.\n<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/crime/article1847697.ece|publisher=The Times|title=VIP 'stalker' squad set up by government|author=Joanna Bale|date=May 27, 2007 | location=London}}</ref> They may then be referred to local health services for further assessment and potential [[involuntary commitment]].

On 1 April 2007 the [[Border and Immigration Agency]] (BIA) was created and commenced operation. However, there were no police officers in the Agency, a matter that attracted considerable criticism when the Agency was established - agency officers have limited powers of arrest.  Further powers for designated officers within the Agency, including powers of detention pending the arrival of a police officer, were introduced by the UK Borders Act 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=All+Legislation&title=uk+borders&parentActiveTextDocId=3419168&ActiveTextDocId=3419168&filesize=198579 |title=UK Borders Act 2007 (c. 30) - Statute Law Database |publisher=Statutelaw.gov.uk |date=2007-10-30 |accessdate=2009-05-28}}</ref>\n\nThe Government has effectively admitted the shortcomings of the Agency by making a number of fundamental changes within a year of its commencement.

Based in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], the unit was authorized on September 15, 1915, as an exclusively Canadian Grenadier Guards (CGG) formation with Guards uniforms and accoutrements approved by The [[Governor General of Canada]], HRH, Duke of Connaught (Colonel of the Canadian Grenadier Guards). Mobilization and recruiting for soldiers began on October 23, 1915.   \n  \nMore than 4,213 men served in the 87th Battalion, representing all regions of Canada, but predominantly Ontario, until&nbsp; the last few months of the&nbsp; war&nbsp; when the balance was furnished by soldiers from Quebec (included the need to form a&nbsp; francophone coy.) The Battalion earned 17  Battle Honours at a cost&nbsp; of 886 dead & 2,246 wounded, many of them wounded multiple times.  \n[[File:87th Battalion badges.jpg|thumb|Badges of the 87th Battalion (Canadian Grenadier Guards) CEF - Hayes-Rivet (MHR) collection]]\n\n== Unit distinctions & achievements ==\nThe 87th Battalion (Canadian Grenadier Guards) CEF holds several distinctions in compared to other CEF battalions:\n* CGG was one of only 7 Militia Regiments (out of 51 CEF units) to recruit their own battalions that fought as a distinct unit within the Canadian Corps.\n* The 87th Battalion was one of only 3 Canadian units authorized by the Minister of Militia, Sir Sam Hughes, to recruit across all of Canada. The other 2 were the [[Royal Canadian Regiment]] and [[Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry]].\n* The 87th Battalion was the only Canadian Foot Guards CEF unit active during The Great War. The Governor Generals Foot Guards (GGFG) contributed volunteers for the 2nd Battalion (Eastern Ontario Regiment), CEF, and the 77th Battalion CEF (Ottawa), CEF. The Governor Generals Horse Guards (GGHG) contributed men for the 4th and 7th Canadian Mounted Rifles (Bantams) CEF, but these were composite or regional units (more on that later) and none bore the title or accoutrements of Guards.\n* Title of 'Guardsman' was awarded by [[King George V]] in 1919 as a permanent distinction in conjunction with all other Guards units, in recognition of their collective contributions to victory in the Great War.\n* 87th Battalion were the first to liberate Belgium on 5 November, 1918. Patrols from the 87th Battalion (Canadian Grenadier Guards), of the 4th Division, crossed the River Aunelle, thereby marking the liberation, by the Canadians, of the first part of occupied Belgium.\n* The 87th Battalion had within it\u2019s ranks 4 members who Founded/Formed CEF Battalions during WWI: BGen Frank S. Meighen (14th and 87th Bns); Col. Hercule Barre (150th Bn) ; Maj. Olivar F-J. Asselin (163rd Bn); and LCol J. V. O'Donahoe, (199th Bn)\n\n== Unit milestones ==\n=== Mobilization and England ===\nThe 87th Battalion departed Canada after boarding R.M.S. [[RMS Empress of Britain (1905)|''Empress of Britain'']] on April 23, 1916 and arrived in Liverpool, England on May 5, 1916. The battalion arrived and billeted on May 27 at Bramshott Military Camp as part of the 12th Infantry Brigade (until June 1916) and then designated as part of the 11th Infantry Brigade of the 4th Canadian Infantry Division in August of the same year. During the period in England, the battalion received training from an officer and four drill sergeants from the British Grenadier Guards, all trench veterans, all previously wounded in action (WIA). On August 11/12, the battalion crossed over to France and landed at Le Havre, France on August 13, 1916 with a total strength of 1,090 all ranks. The battalion served the duration of the war as part of the 11th Infantry Brigade, 4th Canadian Infantry Division.\n\n=== First Actions & casualties ===\nFollowing the [[Battle of Mont Sorrel]], 303 members of the 87th Battalion were detached to reinforce the [[1st Battalion (Ontario Regiment), CEF]]. Of these CGG members, two, 177281 Private John Leitch, (later KIA 9 April, 1917), and 178218 Private William Anson Ogilvie, would distinguish themselves with the 1st Battalion during the Battle of the Somme and win multiple Military Medals for bravery in the field. The initial loss of men were replaced by 391 officers & men from the 77th, Battalion, (Ottawa) CEF, from the GGFG. The battalion was introduced and indoctrinated into trench warfare beginning August 18, 1916 in the Ypres area. Their first casualties, two wounded, occurred that same day. The first 87th Battalion fatality occurred on August 26, 1916. Total casualties for the first weeks of the war were eventually 17 KIA / 25 WIA. On September 16, 1916, the 87th battalion participated in their first trench raid resulting in 36 casualties out of 60 engaged unit members.\n\n===  Battle of the Somme ===\nOn 10 October, 1916, the 87th Battalion was relocated to Albert area along the Ancre area and on the 21 October, attacked and took a section of Regina Trench. The first gallantry awards earned by the 87th Battalion were awarded to four members for the attack on Regina Trench, CSM W. Blaney, Sgt. J.C. Noon, Ptes J.E. Blaney, and J.D. Hunter. After some routine activities and tours along the front, on November 18, the 87th Battalion was assigned to capture a section of Desire Trench, as well as its support systems. The attack was launched from Regina Trench. It succeeded well beyond expectations, and in addition to capturing Desire, Major Franklin Hall, with 41 volunteers, with only their rifles, bayonets, grenades and 2 Lewis Guns advanced a further 500 yards and captured part of Grandcourt Trench, including taking 115 prisoners. 80 of these were taken unaided by four privates; Roy, Thompson, Garneau and Winke.  \n[[File:Plan of Attack Vimy Ridge.jpg|thumb|87th Battalion was to advance as part of the 11th Brigage, 4th Division. (2nd from top) Plan of Attack for Vimy Ridge 9 April 1917]]\n\n=== Battle of Vimy Ridge ===\nThe Battle of Vimy Ridge was a terrible tragedy for the battalion. Progress on the right was slow because, for a time and in part, the centre had practically collapsed.The 87th Battalion (Canadian Grenadier Guards) were in the first wave but for some reason, a section of enemy trench barely a hundred metres in front of them had been left untouched by the artillery bombardment. (it has been suggested that the 87th Battalion commanding officer, Major Harold Leroy Shaw wanted to use it as a first-aid station and battalion headquarters later on.) Subsequently,the company assaulting it was virtually wiped out in just six minutes, and \u2018sixty per cent of its strength lay dead on the ground.\u2019It was not a good beginning, delaying the other guardsmen so that they lost the barrage, and those who tried to continue the advance were cut down by German machine gunners firing from positions of relative safety in the untouched trenches.   \n\nThe 87th Battalion War diaries reports that six of the seven officers leading the 87th into battle were killed or wounded within the first hours. \"Word had been received that Captain Harry Sare, (Officer Commanding the Assault), had been shot through the head with a bullet and could no longer carry on. Lieutenant Yonkles had also been hit in the left arm, Majors Joy and Ross and Lieut. Savage had been killed, and Lieut. Sinclair badly wounded, leaving Lieutenant Hannaford the only available officer of those who went over.\" The 87th diary names 11 officers killed or wounded and notes 110 other ranks killed, 157 wounded and 25 missing.    \n\n==Officers Commanding==\n*Lieut.-Col.

Based in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], the unit was authorized on September 15, 1915, as an exclusively Canadian Grenadier Guards (CGG) formation with Guards uniforms and accoutrements approved by The [[Governor General of Canada]], HRH, Duke of Connaught (Colonel of the Canadian Grenadier Guards). Mobilization and recruiting for soldiers began on October 23, 1915.   \n  \nMore than 4,213 men served in the 87th Battalion, representing all regions of Canada, but predominantly Ontario, until&nbsp; the last few months of the&nbsp; war&nbsp; when the balance was furnished by soldiers from Quebec (included the need to form a&nbsp; francophone coy.) The Battalion earned 17  Battle Honours at a cost&nbsp; of 886 dead & 2,246 wounded, many of them wounded multiple times.  \n[[File:87th Battalion badges.jpg|thumb|Badges of the 87th Battalion (Canadian Grenadier Guards) CEF - Hayes-Rivet (MHR) collection]]\n\n== Unit distinctions & achievements ==\nThe 87th Battalion (Canadian Grenadier Guards) CEF holds several distinctions in compared to other CEF battalions:\n* CGG was one of only 7 Militia Regiments (out of 51 CEF units) to recruit their own battalions that fought as a distinct unit within the Canadian Corps.\n* The 87th Battalion was one of only 3 Canadian units authorized by the Minister of Militia, Sir Sam Hughes, to recruit across all of Canada. The other 2 were the [[Royal Canadian Regiment]] and [[Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry]].\n* The 87th Battalion was the only Canadian Foot Guards CEF unit active during The Great War. The Governor Generals Foot Guards (GGFG) contributed volunteers for the 2nd Battalion (Eastern Ontario Regiment), CEF, and the 77th Battalion CEF (Ottawa), CEF. The Governor Generals Horse Guards (GGHG) contributed men for the 4th and 7th Canadian Mounted Rifles (Bantams) CEF, but these were composite or regional units (more on that later) and none bore the title or accoutrements of Guards.\n* Title of 'Guardsman' was awarded by [[King George V]] in 1919 as a permanent distinction in conjunction with all other Guards units, in recognition of their collective contributions to victory in the Great War.\n* 87th Battalion were the first to liberate Belgium on 5 November, 1918. Patrols from the 87th Battalion (Canadian Grenadier Guards), of the 4th Division, crossed the River Aunelle, thereby marking the liberation, by the Canadians, of the first part of occupied Belgium.\n* The 87th Battalion boast having within it\u2019s ranks 4 members who Founded/Formed CEF Battalions during WWI: BGen Frank S. Meighen (14th and 87th Bns); Col. Hercule Barre (150th Bn) ; Maj. Olivar F-J. Asselin (163rd Bn); and LCol J. V. O'Donahoe, (199th Bn)\n\n== Unit milestones ==\n=== Mobilization and England ===\nThe 87th Battalion departed Canada after boarding R.M.S. [[RMS Empress of Britain (1905)|''Empress of Britain'']] on April 23, 1916 and arrived in Liverpool, England on May 5, 1916. The battalion arrived and billeted on May 27 at Bramshott Military Camp as part of the 12th Infantry Brigade (until June 1916) and then designated as part of the 11th Infantry Brigade of the 4th Canadian Infantry Division in August of the same year. During the period in England, the battalion received training from an officer and four drill sergeants from the British Grenadier Guards, all trench veterans, all previously wounded in action (WIA). On August 11/12, the battalion crossed over to France and landed at Le Havre, France on August 13, 1916 with a total strength of 1,090 all ranks. The battalion served the duration of the war as part of the 11th Infantry Brigade, 4th Canadian Infantry Division.\n\n=== First Actions & casualties ===\nFollowing the [[Battle of Mont Sorrel]], 303 members of the 87th Battalion were detached to reinforce the [[1st Battalion (Ontario Regiment), CEF]]. Of these CGG members, two, 177281 Private John Leitch, (later KIA 9 April, 1917), and 178218 Private William Anson Ogilvie, would distinguish themselves with the 1st Battalion during the Battle of the Somme and win multiple Military Medals for bravery in the field. The initial loss of men were replaced by 391 officers & men from the 77th, Battalion, (Ottawa) CEF, from the GGFG. The battalion was introduced and indoctrinated into trench warfare beginning August 18, 1916 in the Ypres area. Their first casualties, two wounded, occurred that same day. The first 87th Battalion fatality occurred on August 26, 1916. Total casualties for the first weeks of the war were eventually 17 KIA / 25 WIA. On September 16, 1916, the 87th battalion participated in their first trench raid resulting in 36 casualties out of 60 engaged unit members.\n\n===  Battle of the Somme ===\nOn 10 October, 1916, the 87th Battalion was relocated to Albert area along the Ancre area and on the 21 October, attacked and took a section of Regina Trench. The first gallantry awards earned by the 87th Battalion were awarded to four members for the attack on Regina Trench, CSM W. Blaney, Sgt. J.C. Noon, Ptes J.E. Blaney, and J.D. Hunter. After some routine activities and tours along the front, on November 18, the 87th Battalion was assigned to capture a section of Desire Trench, as well as its support systems. The attack was launched from Regina Trench. It succeeded well beyond expectations, and in addition to capturing Desire, Major Franklin Hall, with 41 volunteers, with only their rifles, bayonets, grenades and 2 Lewis Guns advanced a further 500 yards and captured part of Grandcourt Trench, including taking 115 prisoners. 80 of these were taken unaided by four privates; Roy, Thompson, Garneau and Winke.  \n[[File:Plan of Attack Vimy Ridge.jpg|thumb|87th Battalion was to advance as part of the 11th Brigage, 4th Division. (2nd from top) Plan of Attack for Vimy Ridge 9 April 1917]]\n\n=== Battle of Vimy Ridge ===\nThe Battle of Vimy Ridge was a terrible tragedy for the battalion. Progress on the right was slow because, for a time and in part, the centre had practically collapsed.The 87th Battalion (Canadian Grenadier Guards) were in the first wave but for some reason, a section of enemy trench barely a hundred metres in front of them had been left untouched by the artillery bombardment. (it has been suggested that the 87th Battalion commanding officer, Major Harold Leroy Shaw wanted to use it as a first-aid station and battalion headquarters later on.) Subsequently,the company assaulting it was virtually wiped out in just six minutes, and \u2018sixty per cent of its strength lay dead on the ground.\u2019It was not a good beginning, delaying the other guardsmen so that they lost the barrage, and those who tried to continue the advance were cut down by German machine gunners firing from positions of relative safety in the untouched trenches.   \n\nThe 87th Battalion War diaries reports that six of the seven officers leading the 87th into battle were killed or wounded within the first hours. \"Word had been received that Captain Harry Sare, (Officer Commanding the Assault), had been shot through the head with a bullet and could no longer carry on. Lieutenant Yonkles had also been hit in the left arm, Majors Joy and Ross and Lieut. Savage had been killed, and Lieut. Sinclair badly wounded, leaving Lieutenant Hannaford the only available officer of those who went over.\" The 87th diary names 11 officers killed or wounded and notes 110 other ranks killed, 157 wounded and 25 missing.    \n\n==Officers Commanding==\n*Lieut.-Col.
