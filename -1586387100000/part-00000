Cook Forest features 27 marked trails totaling 29 miles for hiking. The terrain is of rolling hills and cool valley streams. Scenic areas include the old growth forest, Fire Tower/Seneca Point and the Clarion River.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}} Among Cook Forest's primary attractions is the \"Forest Cathedral\" area of old growth white pine and hemlock, some trees of which top 180 feet. About 5,000 acres are open to hunting, trapping, and the training of dogs during established seasons. Common game species are deer, wild turkey, bear, and squirrel. The Clarion River flows along the park border and provides fishing for trout, warm-water game fish and panfish. Visitors can canoe or kayak down the river.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\n== Theater and the arts ==\n\nDuBois is building a strong reputation for local entertainment and the arts in the tri-county area.\n\nMore traditional arts can be found at the Winkler Gallery of Fine Arts, founded by local artist Perry Winkler. The Winkler Gallery of Fine Arts opened its doors in December 2003 as a co-op for local artists to display and sell their work to the public. The gallery hosts the annual DuBois Arts Festival. Along with supporting the local artist community, the gallery provides art education for the residents of the DuBois area through artist workshops in several mediums such as stained glass, silk painting, and watercolors.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.winklergalleryoffineart.org/aboutus.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-02-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150211184601/http://www.winklergalleryoffineart.org/aboutus.html |archive-date=2015-02-11 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nTheater groups \"Reitz Theater Players\" and \"Cultural Resources Inc.\" perform a selection of theater productions each year at the Paul G.

One source claims 1898, another 1897. It seems most likely that this occurred between April and the end of 1896. It was on April 16, 1896, that the ''DuBois Weekly Courier'' reported: \"Some new developments in connection with the [[brewery]] may be looked for in the near future.\"\n\nThere were a number of reasons Hahne chose the DuBois site for his facility, but the most frequently cited was the excellence of the water supply. He purchased {{convert|2300|acre|km2}} surrounding the local reservoir to protect the watershed from pollution.\n\nBy 1906, the brewery had four products on the market: DuBois Wurzburger, Hahne's Export Pilsener, DuBois Porter, and DuBois Budweiser. The Budweiser name would be at the center of controversy for 60 years between DuBois Brewing and [[Anheuser-Busch]].\n\nThe DuBois brands soon traveled far and wide for a brewery of its size, ranging up to {{convert|150|mi}} away and selling well in Buffalo, [[Erie, Pennsylvania|Erie]] and Pittsburgh. The brewery's 300-barrel kettle was kept busy churning out brands, while the left-over grain materials were pressed and sold for cattle feed and grist mills in the rural areas surrounding DuBois.\n\nAs with many other American breweries, DuBois Brewing moved right along until 1918 and the advent of [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]]. The brewery shifted production to \"[[near beer]]\" and soft drinks and opened the H&G Ice Company. According to the April 7, 1933, ''DuBois Courier'', the brewery won the honor of being one of only two breweries in the entire nation that had never violated or been suspected of violating the Prohibition laws since the [[Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|18th Amendment]] went into effect. As a result, DuBois Brewing Company was issued license number G-2, allowing them to resume brewing immediately upon the enaction of the [[Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution|21st Amendment]].\n\nFrank Hahne died in 1932, and the brewery was passed to his only son, Frank Hahne Jr., whose own only son died in infancy, leaving the family without an heir. Hahne Jr. sold the brewery to Pittsburgh Brewing in 1967.\n\nThe brewery was torn down in late 2003.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://duboishs.com/index.php/dubois-brewery/|title=DuBois Brewery|website=duboishs.com}}</ref>\n\n== Notable people ==\n* [[Thomas S.

One source claims 1898, another 1897. It seems most likely that this occurred between April and the end of 1896. It was on April 16, 1896, that the ''DuBois Weekly Courier'' reported: \"Some new developments in connection with the [[brewery]] may be looked for in the near future.\"\n\nThere were a number of reasons Hahne chose the DuBois site for his facility, but the most frequently cited was the excellence of the water supply. He purchased {{convert|2300|acre|km2}} surrounding the local reservoir to protect the watershed from pollution.\n\nBy 1906, the brewery had four products on the market: DuBois Wurzburger, Hahne's Export Pilsener, DuBois Porter, and DuBois Budweiser. The Budweiser name would be at the center of controversy for 60 years between DuBois Brewing and [[Anheuser-Busch]].\n\nThe DuBois brands soon traveled far and wide for a brewery of its size, ranging up to {{convert|150|mi}} away and selling well in Buffalo, [[Erie, Pennsylvania|Erie]] and Pittsburgh. The brewery's 300-barrel kettle was kept busy churning out brands, while the left-over grain materials were pressed and sold for cattle feed and grist mills in the rural areas surrounding DuBois.\n\nAs with many other American breweries, DuBois Brewing moved right along until 1918 and the advent of [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]]. The brewery shifted production to \"[[near beer]]\" and soft drinks and opened the H&G Ice Company. According to the April 7, 1933, ''DuBois Courier'', the brewery won the honor of being one of only two breweries in the entire nation that had never violated or been suspected of violating the Prohibition laws since the [[Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|18th Amendment]] went into effect. As a result, DuBois Brewing Company was issued license number G-2, allowing them to resume brewing immediately upon the enaction of the [[Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution|21st Amendment]].\n\nFrank Hahne died in 1932, and the brewery was passed to his only son, Frank Hahne Jr., whose own only son died in infancy, leaving the family without an heir. Hahne Jr. sold the brewery to Pittsburgh Brewing in 1967.\n\nThe brewery was torn down in late 2003.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://duboishs.com/index.php/dubois-brewery/|title=DuBois Brewery|website=duboishs.com}}</ref>\n\n== Notable people ==\n* [[Thomas S.

Initially a backing musician for [[Dottie West]], he also worked with [[Bob Luman]] and [[Chet Atkins]] before beginning a solo career in the late 1970s. He has released eighteen studio albums and over fifty singles for several different record labels.\n\nWariner experienced his greatest chart successes in the 1980s, recording first for [[RCA Records Nashville]] and then [[Universal Music Group Nashville|MCA Nashville]]. While on these labels he sent a number of singles into the top ten of the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts and received favorable critical reception for the amount of creative control he held over his body of work. Upon moving to [[Arista Nashville]] in 1991 he had his most commercially successful album ''[[I Am Ready]]'', his first to be certified [[music recording sales certification|gold]], but followups were less successful. After a period of commercial downfall, he experienced a second wave of success in the late 1990s, spurred by co-writing the number-one singles \"[[Longneck Bottle]]\" by [[Garth Brooks]] and \"[[Nothin' but the Taillights (song)|Nothin' but the Taillights]]\" by [[Clint Black]]. These songs led to him signing with [[Capitol Records]] Nashville and achieving two more gold albums with ''[[Burnin' the Roadhouse Down]]'' and ''[[Two Teardrops]]'' by decade's end. While his commercial success once again dwindled after these albums, he has continued to record independently on his own SelecTone label.\n\nTen of Wariner's singles have reached the number-one position on the Hot Country Songs charts: \"[[All Roads Lead to You]]\", \"[[Some Fools Never Learn]]\", \"[[You Can Dream of Me]]\", \"[[Life's Highway (song)|Life's Highway]]\", \"[[Small Town Girl (Steve Wariner song)|Small Town Girl]]\", \"[[The Weekend (Steve Wariner song)|The Weekend]]\", \"[[Lynda (Steve Wariner song)|Lynda]]\", \"[[Where Did I Go Wrong]]\", \"[[I Got Dreams (song)|I Got Dreams]]\", and \"[[What If I Said]]\" (a duet with [[Anita Cochran]]). Wariner holds several writing credits for both himself and other artists, and has collaborated with [[Nicolette Larson]], [[Glen Campbell]], [[Diamond Rio]], [[Brad Paisley]], [[Asleep at the Wheel]], and [[Mark O'Connor]] among others.

1954) is an American [[country music]] singer, songwriter, and guitarist. Initially a backing musician for [[Dottie West]], he also worked with [[Bob Luman]] and [[Chet Atkins]] before beginning a solo career in the late 1970s. He has released eighteen studio albums and over fifty singles for several different record labels.\n\nWariner experienced his greatest chart successes in the 1980s, recording first for [[RCA Records Nashville]] and then [[Universal Music Group Nashville|MCA Nashville]]. While on these labels he sent a number of singles into the top ten of the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts and received favorable critical reception for the amount of creative control he held over his body of work. Upon moving to [[Arista Nashville]] in 1991 he had his most commercially successful album ''[[I Am Ready]]'', his first to be certified [[music recording sales certification|gold]], but followups were less successful. After a period of commercial downfall, he experienced a second wave of success in the late 1990s, spurred by co-writing the number-one singles \"[[Longneck Bottle]]\" by [[Garth Brooks]] and \"[[Nothin' but the Taillights (song)|Nothin' but the Taillights]]\" by [[Clint Black]]. These songs led to him signing with [[Capitol Records]] Nashville and achieving two more gold albums with ''[[Burnin' the Roadhouse Down]]'' and ''[[Two Teardrops]]'' by decade's end. While his commercial success once again dwindled after these albums, he has continued to record independently on his own SelecTone label.\n\nTen of Wariner's singles have reached the number-one position on the Hot Country Songs charts: \"[[All Roads Lead to You]]\", \"[[Some Fools Never Learn]]\", \"[[You Can Dream of Me]]\", \"[[Life's Highway (song)|Life's Highway]]\", \"[[Small Town Girl (Steve Wariner song)|Small Town Girl]]\", \"[[The Weekend (Steve Wariner song)|The Weekend]]\", \"[[Lynda (Steve Wariner song)|Lynda]]\", \"[[Where Did I Go Wrong]]\", \"[[I Got Dreams (song)|I Got Dreams]]\", and \"[[What If I Said]]\" (a duet with [[Anita Cochran]]). Wariner holds several writing credits for both himself and other artists, and has collaborated with [[Nicolette Larson]], [[Glen Campbell]], [[Diamond Rio]], [[Brad Paisley]], [[Asleep at the Wheel]], and [[Mark O'Connor]] among others. He has also won four [[Grammy Award]]s: one for Best Country Collaboration with Vocals, and three for Best Country Instrumental. In addition to these he has won three [[Country Music Association]] awards and one [[Academy of Country Music]] award, and is a member of the [[Grand Ole Opry]]. Wariner's musical style is defined by his lead guitar work, lyrical content, and stylistic diversity.\n\n==Early life==\nSteven Noel Wariner was born on December 25, 1954, in [[Noblesville, Indiana]],<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> but grew up in [[Russell Springs, Kentucky]].<ref name=\"wizard\"/> As a teenager, Wariner taught himself how to play several instruments, including [[acoustic guitar]], [[bass guitar]], [[drum kit|drums]], [[banjo]], and [[steel guitar]].<ref name=\"hearts\">{{cite news | url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/112289973/ | title=Steve Wariner hits #1 spot in hearts of country artists | work=[[The Tennesseean]] | date=September 28, 1982 | accessdate=September 29, 2019 | author=[[Robert K.

She achieved fame during the 1940s as one of the era's top stars, appearing in 61 films over 37 years. The press coined the term \"The Love Goddess\" to describe Hayworth after she had become the most glamorous screen idol of the 1940s. She was the top [[Pin-up model|pin-up girl]] for [[G.I.

[[Fred Astaire]], with whom she made two films, ''[[You'll Never Get Rich]]'' (1941), and ''[[You Were Never Lovelier]]'' (1942), once called her his favorite dance partner. She also starred in the [[Technicolor]] musical ''[[Cover Girl (film)|Cover Girl]]'' (1944), with [[Gene Kelly]]. She is listed as one of the top 25 female motion picture stars of all time in the [[American Film Institute]]'s survey, [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Stars]].\n\nIn 1980, Hayworth was diagnosed with [[Alzheimer's disease]], which contributed to her death at age 68. The public disclosure and discussion of her illness drew attention to Alzheimer's, which was largely unknown by most people at the time, and helped to increase public and [[Alzheimer's Association|private]] funding for [[Alzheimer's disease#Research directions|Alzheimer's research]].\n\n==Early life==\n{{multiple image\n<!-- Essential parameters -->\n| align     = left\n| direction = vertical\n| width     = 170\n<!-- Image 1 -->\n| image1    = Hayworth-American-c1931.jpg\n| alt1      =\n| caption1 = At age 12, Margarita (later Rita) was dancing professionally as her father's partner in \"The Dancing Cansinos\", 1931.\n<!-- Image 2 -->\n| image2    =Dancing-Cansinos-1933.jpg\n| alt2      =\n| caption2 = Margarita, at age 16, with her father and dancing partner, 1933\n<!-- Image 3 -->\n| image3    =Rita-Eduardo-Cansino-1935.jpg\n| alt3      =\n| caption3 = Rita and her father, 1935\n}}\nHayworth was born in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]] the oldest child of two dancers.

She was adept in [[ballet]], [[Tap dance|tap]], [[Ballroom dance|ballroom]], and Spanish routines. Cohn continued to showcase Hayworth's dance talents. Columbia featured her in the Technicolor films ''[[Tonight and Every Night]]'' (1945) with [[Lee Bowman]] and ''[[Down to Earth (1947 film)|Down to Earth]]'' (1947) with [[Larry Parks]].{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\n[[File:Gilda trailer hayworth1.JPG|thumb|Hayworth as ''Gilda'' (1946)]]\n\nHer sexy, glamorous appeal was most noted in [[Charles Vidor]]'s [[film noir]] ''[[Gilda]]'' (1946) with [[Glenn Ford]], which caused censors some consternation.

They began a year-long courtship, and were married on May 27, 1949. Hayworth left Hollywood and sailed for France, breaking her contract with Columbia.\n\nBecause Hayworth was already one of the most well-known celebrities in the world, the courtship and the wedding received enormous press coverage around the world. Because she was still legally married to second husband Orson Welles during the early days of her courtship with the prince, Hayworth also received some negative backlash, causing some American fans to boycott her pictures. Their wedding marked the first time a Hollywood actress became a princess. On December 28, 1949, Hayworth gave birth to the couple's only daughter, Princess [[Yasmin Aga Khan]].\n\nThough Hayworth was anxious to start a new life abroad, away from Hollywood, Aly Khan's flamboyant lifestyle and duties proved too difficult for Hayworth. She struggled to fit in with his friends, and found it difficult to learn French. Aly Khan was also known in circles as a playboy, and it was suspected that he had been unfaithful to Hayworth during the marriage.\n\nIn 1951, Hayworth set sail with her two daughters for New York. Although the couple did reconcile for a short time, they divorced in 1953.\n\n===Returning to Columbia===\n{{more citations needed|section|date=January 2018}}\nAfter the collapse of her marriage to Khan, Rita Hayworth was forced to return to Hollywood to star in her \"comeback\" picture, ''[[Affair in Trinidad]]'' (1952) which again paired her with [[Glenn Ford]]. Director [[Vincent Sherman]] recalled that Hayworth seemed \"rather frightened at the approach of doing another picture\". She continued to clash with Columbia boss Harry Cohn, and was placed on suspension during filming. Nevertheless, the picture was highly publicized. The picture ended up grossing $1 million more than her previous blockbuster, ''Gilda''.\n\nShe continued to star in a string of successful pictures. In 1953, she had two films released: ''[[Salome (1953 film)|Salome]]'' with [[Charles Laughton]] and [[Stewart Granger]], and ''[[Miss Sadie Thompson]]'' with [[Jos\u00e9 Ferrer]] and [[Aldo Ray]]. She was off the big screen for another four years, mainly because of a tumultuous marriage to the singer [[Dick Haymes]]. During her marriage to Haymes, she was involved in much negative publicity, which significantly lessened her appeal. By the time she returned to the screen for ''[[Fire Down Below (1957 film)|Fire Down Below]]'' (1957), [[Kim Novak]] had become Columbia's top female star. Her last musical was ''[[Pal Joey (film)|Pal Joey]]'' (1957). After this film, Hayworth left Columbia for good.\n\nShe received good reviews for her performance in ''[[Separate Tables (film)|Separate Tables]]'' (1958), with [[Burt Lancaster]] and [[David Niven]], and ''[[The Story on Page One (film)|The Story on Page One]]'' (1960). She continued working throughout the 1960s.

When she showed up at the clubs, he got a larger audience. Haymes was desperate for money, because two of his former wives were taking legal action against him for unpaid child support. His financial problems were so bad, he could not return to California without being arrested.<ref>\"Dick Haymes Faces Arrest Over Alimony\", ''Los Angeles Times'', October 5, 1956</ref> On July 7, 1954, his ex-wife [[Nora Eddington]] got a bench warrant for his arrest, because he owed her $3,800 in alimony.

Not long after he met Hayworth, U.S. officials initiated proceedings to have him deported to Argentina for being an illegal alien. He hoped Hayworth could influence the government and keep him in the United States. When she assumed responsibility for his citizenship, a bond was formed that led to marriage. The two were married on September 24, 1953, at the [[Sands Hotel and Casino|Sands Hotel, Las Vegas]], and their wedding procession went through the casino.\n\nFrom the start of their marriage, Haymes was deeply indebted to the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS). When Hayworth took time off from attending his comeback performances in [[Philadelphia]], the audiences sharply declined. Haymes's $5000 weekly salary was attached by the IRS to pay a $100,000 bill, and he was unable to pay his pianist. Haymes's ex-wives demanded money while Hayworth publicly bemoaned her own lack of alimony from Aly Khan. At one point, the couple was effectively imprisoned in a hotel room for 24 hours in [[Manhattan]] at the Hotel Madison as sheriff's deputies waited outside threatening to arrest Haymes for outstanding debts. At the same time, Hayworth was fighting a severe custody battle with Khan, during which she reported death threats against their children. While living in New York, Hayworth sent the children to live with their nanny in [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]]. They were found and photographed by a reporter from ''[[Confidential (magazine)|Confidential]]'' magazine.\n\nAfter a tumultuous two years together, Haymes struck Hayworth in the face in 1955 in public at the Cocoanut Grove nightclub in Los Angeles. Hayworth packed her bags, walked out, and never returned. The assault and crisis shook her, and her doctor ordered her to remain in bed for several days.<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ZywPAAAAIBAJ&sjid=XYUDAAAAIBAJ&dq=rita%20hayworth%20doctor&pg=5468%2C62157 \"Marriage Falls Down and So Does Rita\"], UP, August 30, 1955.</ref>\n\nHayworth was short of money after her marriage to Haymes. She had failed to gain child support from Aly Khan. She sued Orson Welles for back payment of child support which she claimed had never been paid.

One night, Heston and his wife Lydia joined the couple for dinner at a restaurant in Spain with the director [[George Marshall (director)|George Marshall]] and the actor [[Rex Harrison]], Hayworth's co-star in ''[[The Happy Thieves]]''. Heston wrote that the occasion \"turned into the single most embarrassing evening of my life\", describing how Hill heaped \"obscene abuse\" on Hayworth until she was \"reduced to a helpless flood of tears, her face buried in her hands\". Heston wrote that the others sat stunned, witnesses to a \"marital massacre\", and, though he was \"strongly tempted to slug him\" (Hill), he left with his wife Lydia after she stood up, almost in tears.

She achieved fame during the 1940s as one of the era's top stars, appearing in 61 films over 37 years. The press coined the term \"The Love Goddess\" to describe Hayworth after she had become the most glamorous screen idol of the 1940s. She was the top [[Pin-up model|pin-up girl]] for [[G.I. (military)|GIs]] during [[World War II]].<ref name=chitribobt>{{cite news |url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1987/05/16/page/8/ |newspaper=Chicago Tribune |agency=Associated Press |title=Rita Hayworth, 68, films' 'Love Goddess' |date=May 16, 1987 |page=8 }}</ref>\n\nHayworth is perhaps best known for her performance in the 1946 [[film noir]] ''[[Gilda]]'', opposite [[Glenn Ford]], in which she played the ''[[femme fatale]]'' in her first major dramatic role. She is also known for her performances in, ''[[Only Angels Have Wings]]'' (1939), ''[[The Lady from Shanghai]]'' (1947), ''[[Pal Joey (film)|Pal Joey]]'' (1957), and ''[[Separate Tables (film)|Separate Tables]]'' (1958). [[Fred Astaire]], with whom she made two films, ''[[You'll Never Get Rich]]'' (1941), and ''[[You Were Never Lovelier]]'' (1942), once called her his favorite dance partner. She also starred in the [[Technicolor]] musical ''[[Cover Girl (film)|Cover Girl]]'' (1944), with [[Gene Kelly]]. She is listed as one of the top 25 female motion picture stars of all time in the [[American Film Institute]]'s survey, [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Stars]].\n\nIn 1980, Hayworth was diagnosed with [[Alzheimer's disease]], which contributed to her death at age 68.

She was adept in [[ballet]], [[Tap dance|tap]], [[Ballroom dance|ballroom]], and Spanish routines. Cohn continued to showcase Hayworth's dance talents.

They began a year-long courtship, and were married on May 27, 1949. Hayworth left Hollywood and sailed for France, breaking her contract with Columbia.\n\nBecause Hayworth was already one of the most well-known celebrities in the world, the courtship and the wedding received enormous press coverage around the world. Because she was still legally married to second husband Orson Welles during the early days of her courtship with the prince, Hayworth also received some negative backlash, causing some American fans to boycott her pictures. Their wedding marked the first time a Hollywood actress became a princess. On December 28, 1949, Hayworth gave birth to the couple's only daughter, Princess [[Yasmin Aga Khan]].\n\nThough Hayworth was anxious to start a new life abroad, away from Hollywood, Aly Khan's flamboyant lifestyle and duties proved too difficult for Hayworth. She struggled to fit in with his friends, and found it difficult to learn French. Aly Khan was also known in circles as a playboy, and it was suspected that he had been unfaithful to Hayworth during the marriage.\n\nIn 1951, Hayworth set sail with her two daughters for New York. Although the couple did reconcile for a short time, they divorced in 1953.\n\n===Returning to Columbia===\n{{more citations needed|section|date=January 2018}}\nAfter the collapse of her marriage to Khan, Rita Hayworth was forced to return to Hollywood to star in her \"comeback\" picture, ''[[Affair in Trinidad]]'' (1952) which again paired her with [[Glenn Ford]]. Director [[Vincent Sherman]] recalled that Hayworth seemed \"rather frightened at the approach of doing another picture\". She continued to clash with Columbia boss Harry Cohn, and was placed on suspension during filming. Nevertheless, the picture was highly publicized. The picture ended up grossing $1 million more than her previous blockbuster, ''Gilda''.\n\nShe continued to star in a string of successful pictures. In 1953, she had two films released: ''[[Salome (1953 film)|Salome]]'' with [[Charles Laughton]] and [[Stewart Granger]], and ''[[Miss Sadie Thompson]]'' with [[Jos\u00e9 Ferrer]] and [[Aldo Ray]]. She was off the big screen for another four years, mainly because of a tumultuous marriage to the singer [[Dick Haymes]]. During her marriage to Haymes, she was involved in much negative publicity, which significantly lessened her appeal. By the time she returned to the screen for ''[[Fire Down Below (1957 film)|Fire Down Below]]'' (1957), [[Kim Novak]] had become Columbia's top female star. Her last musical was ''[[Pal Joey (film)|Pal Joey]]'' (1957). After this film, Hayworth left Columbia for good.\n\nShe received good reviews for her performance in ''[[Separate Tables (film)|Separate Tables]]'' (1958), with [[Burt Lancaster]] and [[David Niven]], and ''[[The Story on Page One (film)|The Story on Page One]]'' (1960).

Not long after he met Hayworth, U.S. officials initiated proceedings to have him deported to Argentina for being an illegal alien. He hoped Hayworth could influence the government and keep him in the United States. When she assumed responsibility for his citizenship, a bond was formed that led to marriage. The two were married on September 24, 1953, at the [[Sands Hotel and Casino|Sands Hotel, Las Vegas]], and their wedding procession went through the casino.\n\nFrom the start of their marriage, Haymes was deeply indebted to the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS). When Hayworth took time off from attending his comeback performances in [[Philadelphia]], the audiences sharply declined. Haymes's $5000 weekly salary was attached by the IRS to pay a $100,000 bill, and he was unable to pay his pianist. Haymes's ex-wives demanded money while Hayworth publicly bemoaned her own lack of alimony from Aly Khan. At one point, the couple was effectively imprisoned in a hotel room for 24 hours in [[Manhattan]] at the Hotel Madison as sheriff's deputies waited outside threatening to arrest Haymes for outstanding debts. At the same time, Hayworth was fighting a severe custody battle with Khan, during which she reported death threats against their children. While living in New York, Hayworth sent the children to live with their nanny in [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]]. They were found and photographed by a reporter from ''[[Confidential (magazine)|Confidential]]'' magazine.\n\nAfter a tumultuous two years together, Haymes struck Hayworth in the face in 1955 in public at the Cocoanut Grove nightclub in Los Angeles.

As a teenaged filmgoer in the mid-1950s, he was particularly fascinated with actor [[James Dean]], and he began shooting [[8 mm film]]s.<ref name=\"cbsbio\"/> When his parents invited a director over to his family's house for dinner before auditioning, he met another fellow actor and classmate, [[Ryan O'Neal]], who was about a year younger than Brolin. The two clicked and later enrolled in [[University High School (Los Angeles)|University High School]] located in [[West Los Angeles]]. However, Brolin's own acting exposed his stifling shyness. His assurance grew when O'Neal invited him to a casting agency. Brolin graduated from high school in 1958, and his family was already encouraging him to become an actor like O'Neal.\n\n==Early career==\nBrolin attended [[Santa Monica City College]] and studied drama at the [[University of California at Los Angeles]] before getting a contract with [[20th Century Fox]] in 1960. At Fox, he started out as a contract player in [[Sandra Dee]] movies.<ref>{{cite news|title=At the Movies|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1978/07/21/archives/at-the-movies-jams-brolin-gets-bad-break-on-the-set-in-central-park.html|accessdate=April 17, 2017|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=July 21, 1978}}</ref> Brolin appeared on an episode of ''[[Bus Stop (TV series)|Bus Stop]]'' in 1961. The part led to parts in other television productions such as ''[[Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea (TV series)|Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea]]''; ''[[Margie (TV series)|Margie]]''; ''[[Love, American Style]]''; ''[[Twelve O'Clock High (TV series)|Twelve O'Clock High]]''; and ''[[The Long, Hot Summer]]''. He made three guest appearances on the popular 1960s series ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'', alongside [[Adam West]] and [[Burt Ward]],  as well as roles in ''[[The Virginian (TV series)|The Virginian]]'', and ''[[Owen Marshall: Counselor at Law]]'' alongside [[Arthur Hill (actor)|Arthur Hill]] and [[Lee Majors]]. He also had a recurring role on the short-lived television series ''[[The Monroes (1966 TV series)|The Monroes]]''.\n\nAt the age of 20, he changed his surname from \"Bruderlin\" to \"Brolin\" to become James Brolin. While in school struggling to make it big, he met actor [[Clint Eastwood]]. Brolin also had small roles in several films including ''[[Take Her, She's Mine]]'' (1963), ''[[Dear Brigitte]]'' (1965), ''[[Von Ryan's Express]]'' (1965), and ''[[Fantastic Voyage]]'' (1966). The following year, his first big role was in ''[[The Cape Town Affair]]'' (1967), but it did not receive any success at the box office. Brolin was ultimately fired by 20th Century Fox.\nIn 1969 he co-starred in the TV series ''[[Marcus Welby, M.D.]]'', portraying a doctor.\n\n==Film==\nDuring the 1970s, the 6&nbsp;ft 4&nbsp;inch Brolin began appearing in leading roles in films, including ''[[Skyjacked (film)|Skyjacked]]'' (1972)<ref>{{cite web|title=Skyjacked (1972)|url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/31483%7C0/Skyjacked.html|author=Soares, Emily|publisher=[[Turner Classic Movies]] (TCM)|website=TCM.com|accessdate=16 August 2018}}</ref> and ''[[Westworld (film)|Westworld]]'' (1973). By the mid 1970s, he was a regular leading man in films, starring in ''[[Gable and Lombard]]'' (1976), ''[[The Car]]'' (1977), ''[[Capricorn One]]'' (1978, in which he costarred with [[Elliott Gould]], Streisand's ex-husband), ''[[The Amityville Horror (1979 film)|The Amityville Horror]]'' (1979), ''[[Night of the Juggler]]'' (1980), and ''[[High Risk (1981 film)|High Risk]]'' (1981). When [[Roger Moore]] expressed his desire to vacate the role of [[Production of the James Bond films|James Bond]], Brolin undertook screen tests to replace him in''[[Octopussy]]'' (1983). It has been reported that not only were these successful, but Brolin was actually on the point of moving to London to begin work on the film when the producers persuaded Moore to continue.<ref>{{cite web |last=Jacks |first=Kelso |date=7 April 2020 |title=Roger Moore Was Almost Replaced As James Bond: Watch James Brolin's Audition |url=https://www.screenrant.com/james-bond-roger-moore-replaced-james-brolin-audition/ |website=ScreenRant |access-date=9 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn 1985, Brolin parodied his near-hiring as [[James Bond]] in the film ''[[Pee-Wee's Big Adventure]]''. In a film within the film, he merged the characters of Bond and Pee-Wee Herman, the \"real\" version of whom was played by Paul Reubens. He is referred to as \"PW\" and the role of [[Pee-Wee Herman]]'s girlfriend \"Dottie\" is played by [[Morgan Fairchild]].\n\n==Television==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=August 2018}} \n[[File:James Brolin Kiley Marcus Welby 1969.JPG|thumb|Brolin as Steven Kiley<br />in ''[[Marcus Welby, M.D.]]'' (1969)]]\nIn 1968, Brolin transferred to [[Universal Studios]], where he auditioned for a co-starring role opposite seasoned actor [[Robert Young (actor)|Robert Young]] in the popular [[medical]] [[drama]] ''[[Marcus Welby, M.D.]]'' (1969\u20131976). The series was one of the top-rated television shows of the day. Brolin became widely known for his portrayal of youthful, skilled assistant physician Dr. Steven Kiley. The chemistry between Young & Brolin clicked, and even came to attract young women for its medical interest throughout the show's run. In its first season in 1970, Brolin won the [[Emmy]] Award for Outstanding Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role, and was subsequently nominated three more times. He was also nominated for [[Golden Globes]] three times for Best Supporting Actor, and won twice between 1971 and 1973. Brolin also starred in the [[television film]]s ''[[Short Walk to Daylight]]'' (1972) and ''[[Trapped (1973 film)|Trapped]]'' (1973). He and his first wife Jane also appeared on several episodes of the 1970s game show ''[[Tattletales]]''.\n\nIn 1983, Brolin returned to television to star in another series and teamed with producer [[Aaron Spelling]]'s [[prime-time]] [[soap opera]], ''[[Hotel (American TV series)|Hotel]]'', for [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]].<ref name=NYT>{{cite newspaper|work=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/05/arts/bette-davis-joins-abc-s-fall-lineup.html|date=May 5, 1983|page=C00032|title=BETTE DAVIS JOINS ABC'S FALL LINEUP|author=Bedell, Sally}}</ref> On ''Hotel'' Brolin played Peter McDermott, a hotel manager.<ref name=NYT2>{{cite newspaper|newspaper=The New York Times|date=September 21, 1983|page=C00026|title=TV: ABC OPENS NEW 'HOTEL' SERIES|author=O'Connor, John J.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/21/arts/tv-abc-opens-new-hotel-series.html}}</ref>\n\nFor ''Hotel'' Brolin was nominated twice for [[Golden Globes]] between 1983 and 1984 for Best Performance By an Actor in a TV Series, but did not win either time. He would eventually serve as a director on the show, as well. On one episode of ''Hotel'', he invited his future wife [[Jan Smithers]] to guest-star on the show as the writers suggested that they develop a storyline for them, as Brolin was going through a difficult divorce at the time. By 1988, after 5 seasons, ''Hotel'' was about to close its doors for good and the show was cancelled. That same year, his co-star, Nathan Cook had died of an allergic reaction to penicillin, and Brolin along with the rest of his cast attended his funeral.\n\nActress [[Connie Sellecca]] said of Brolin's on-screen chemistry with her on ''Hotel'', \"I remember instantly feeling comfortable with Jim, and that's the thing that Jim has as to women, most women, they need to feel safe, and Jim gets that.\" She also said, \"To have him in a different role and have that confidence, it was a wonderful experience.\" After the show's cancellation, Sellecca continues to be good friends with Brolin. In 1992, her mentor was in attendance at her wedding to [[John Tesh]].\n\nAs the new decade approached, Brolin starred in both ''Angel Falls'' for [[CBS]] and ''Extreme'' for [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], although neither matched the popularity of his earlier series.\n\nIn 1997, Brolin's luck changed with the syndicated television series ''[[Pensacola: Wings of Gold]]''. He played the role of Lt. Col. Bill \"Raven\" Kelly, whose job was to teach young Marines in a special unit, before being promoted to work with a group of talented Marine fighter pilots. Brolin served as an executive producer and director on the series. In 2000, however, the show was cancelled after 66 episodes due to low ratings.\n\nIn 1997, he also hosted ''[[Beyond Belief: Fact or Fiction]]'', a television series that shows five stories which have to do with the paranormal and supernatural. [[Jonathan Frakes]] took his place after the first season of the show.\n\nIn 1997, Brolin guest-starred on ''[[Roseanne]]''. In Part 1 (\"Lanford's Elite\"), Roseanne & Jackie go to a luncheon at the Lanford Country Club, where they meet the son of their old boss Edgar Wellman Jr. (Brolin) of the Wellman Plastics factory. It appears that the factory is in need of financial help and Roseanne's money could save the factory. In Part 2 (\"Some Enchanted Merger\"), once the Wellman Plastics buyout is completed, Roseanne is at a loss for what to do when a mutual attraction springs between herself and Wellman.\n\n==Since 2000==\nBrolin has had a number of supporting roles in major cinema releases since 2000. These include (amongst others) the role of General Ralph Landry, outgoing director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy in [[Steven Soderbergh]]'s Oscar-winning ''[[Traffic (2000 film)|Traffic]]'' (2000); as Jack Barnes in Steven Spielberg's ''[[Catch Me If You Can]]'' (2002); a minor role in the 2003 comedy ''[[A Guy Thing]]''; as philandering husband Robert Hatch in the 2006 comedy ''[[The Alibi]]'' (released in the UK as ''Lies and Alibis''); as Jack Jennings in the 2007 film ''The American Standards''; as TV network anchor Frank Harris in Richard Shepard's ''[[The Hunting Party (2007 film)|The Hunting Party]]'' (2007); and as Brian in [[Joel Hopkins]]' 2008 film ''[[Last Chance Harvey]]'' with Emma Thompson and Dustin Hoffman.\n\nIn 2002, Brolin played Governor [[Robert Ritchie (TV character)|Robert Ritchie]] of Florida, the Republican opponent of President [[Jed Bartlet]], on the TV series [[The West Wing (TV series)|''The West Wing'']].\n\nIn late 2003, Brolin portrayed [[Ronald Reagan]] in the television film ''[[The Reagans]]''. The film was originally meant to air on CBS, but after creative differences, scripts controversies, and rising costs, CBS passed on the film, and it aired on cable channel [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]], also owned by [[Viacom (2005\u2013present)|Viacom]]. The role earned Brolin his fifth [[Emmy Award]] nomination, as well as his fifth [[Golden Globe]] nomination.\n\nIn 2005, Brolin guest starred on the TV series ''Monk'' as casino owner Daniel Thorn. In 2006, Brolin appeared in the [[A&E Network]] film ''[[Wedding Wars]]'', playing an anti-[[gay marriage]] governor. In 2008, Brolin guest starred on ''[[Law & Order: SVU]]'' as astronaut Col. Dick Finley. The same year, Brolin also starred in the lead role in the Sci-Fi Channel film ''[[Lost City Raiders]]''.\n\nBrolin appeared in the 2009 comedy film ''[[The Goods: Live Hard, Sell Hard]]''.\n\nHe also appeared in a 2009 episode of ''[[Psych]]'', titled \"High Noon-ish\", in which he played the sheriff of a tourist-attracting \"Wild West\" town. The episode was in part a parody of the 1973 film ''[[Westworld (film)|Westworld]]'', in which he had starred.\n\nBrolin has played [[Richard Castle]]'s mysterious father in two episodes of ABC's [[Castle (TV series)|''Castle'']], in 2013 and 2014.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ausiello |first=Michael |url=http://tvline.com/2013/01/22/castle-season-5-scoop-james-brolin-castles-father/ |title=Castle Scoop: Look Who's Playing Rick's Dad! |publisher=TVLine |date=2013-01-22 |accessdate=2016-08-17}}</ref> He appeared in the NBC sitcom ''[[Community (TV series)|Community]]'' as William Winger, Jeff Winger's estranged father.\n\nFrom 2015 until 2019, he played the role of John, the family patriarch, in the CBS comedy ''[[Life in Pieces]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbs.com/shows/life-in-pieces/ |title=Life in Pieces |website=CBS.com |date= |accessdate=2016-08-17}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:Barbra Streisand and James Brolin.jpg|thumb|[[Barbra Streisand]] with Brolin (2013) ]]\nBrolin has been married three times and has three children.\n\nIn 1966, he married Jane Cameron Agee, a wildlife activist and aspiring actress at [[Twentieth Century Fox]], 12 days after they first met.<ref name=PlayboyInt>{{cite journal|author= Stephen Rebello|date=October 2010|title= Playboy Interview: Josh Brolin|journal= [[Playboy (magazine)|Playboy]]}}</ref>  The couple had two children, [[Josh Brolin|Josh]] (b. 1968), and Jess (b. 1972).

Josh said on the October 14, 2008, episode of the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'' that his parents met on the TV series ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'', where his mother was a casting executive. James Brolin is the grandfather of Trevor (b. 1988) and Eden (b. 1994), from his son Josh's first marriage, as well as Westlyn (b. 2018) from Josh's third marriage. \n\nIn the late 1970s, Brolin started a brief, but relatively successful, career in [[sports car racing]]. After success in several celebrity auto races, he entered the 1979 [[24 Hours N\u00fcrburgring]] as part of the [[AMC Spirit]] team. Brolin's two-car team, which included accomplished female racer [[Lyn St. James]], finished both 1st and 2nd in class.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.hemmings.com/mus/stories/2005/02/01/hmn_feature17.html |last=Mattar |first=George |title=AMC Invades Germany \u2013 circa 1979 |journal=Hemmings Muscle Machines |date=February 2005 |accessdate=20 April 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.roadandtrack.com/motorsports/news/a29623/when-the-americans-conquered-the-nurburgring-with-a-amc-spirit/ |title=When the Americans Conquered the Nurburgring with an AMC Spirit |publisher=R&T Magazine |accessdate=January 30, 2019}}</ref> \n\nIn 1985, Brolin met actress [[Jan Smithers]] on the set of ''Hotel'', and they married in 1986.

As a teenaged filmgoer in the mid-1950s, he was particularly fascinated with actor [[James Dean]], and he began shooting [[8 mm film]]s.<ref name=\"cbsbio\"/> When his parents invited a director over to his family's house for dinner before auditioning, he met another fellow actor and classmate, [[Ryan O'Neal]], who was about a year younger than Brolin. The two clicked and later enrolled in [[University High School (Los Angeles)|University High School]] located in [[West Los Angeles]]. However, Brolin's own acting exposed his stifling shyness. His assurance grew when O'Neal invited him to a casting agency. Brolin graduated from high school in 1958, and his family was already encouraging him to become an actor like O'Neal.\n\n==Early career==\nBrolin attended [[Santa Monica City College]] and studied drama at the [[University of California at Los Angeles]] before getting a contract with [[20th Century Fox]] in 1960. At Fox, he started out as a contract player in [[Sandra Dee]] movies.<ref>{{cite news|title=At the Movies|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1978/07/21/archives/at-the-movies-jams-brolin-gets-bad-break-on-the-set-in-central-park.html|accessdate=April 17, 2017|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=July 21, 1978}}</ref> Brolin appeared on an episode of ''[[Bus Stop (TV series)|Bus Stop]]'' in 1961. The part led to parts in other television productions such as ''[[Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea (TV series)|Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea]]''; ''[[Margie (TV series)|Margie]]''; ''[[Love, American Style]]''; ''[[Twelve O'Clock High (TV series)|Twelve O'Clock High]]''; and ''[[The Long, Hot Summer]]''. He made three guest appearances on the popular 1960s series ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'', alongside [[Adam West]] and [[Burt Ward]],  as well as roles in ''[[The Virginian (TV series)|The Virginian]]'', and ''[[Owen Marshall: Counselor at Law]]'' alongside [[Arthur Hill (actor)|Arthur Hill]] and [[Lee Majors]]. He also had a recurring role on the short-lived television series ''[[The Monroes (1966 TV series)|The Monroes]]''.\n\nAt the age of 20, he changed his surname from \"Bruderlin\" to \"Brolin\" to become James Brolin. While in school struggling to make it big, he met actor [[Clint Eastwood]]. Brolin also had small roles in several films including ''[[Take Her, She's Mine]]'' (1963), ''[[Dear Brigitte]]'' (1965), ''[[Von Ryan's Express]]'' (1965), and ''[[Fantastic Voyage]]'' (1966). The following year, his first big role was in ''[[The Cape Town Affair]]'' (1967), but it did not receive any success at the box office. Brolin was ultimately fired by 20th Century Fox.\nIn 1969 he co-starred in the TV series ''[[Marcus Welby, M.D.]]'', portraying a doctor.\n\n==Film==\nDuring the 1970s, the 6&nbsp;ft 4&nbsp;inch Brolin began appearing in leading roles in films, including ''[[Skyjacked (film)|Skyjacked]]'' (1972)<ref>{{cite web|title=Skyjacked (1972)|url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/31483%7C0/Skyjacked.html|author=Soares, Emily|publisher=[[Turner Classic Movies]] (TCM)|website=TCM.com|accessdate=16 August 2018}}</ref> and ''[[Westworld (film)|Westworld]]'' (1973). By the mid 1970s, he was a regular leading man in films, starring in ''[[Gable and Lombard]]'' (1976), ''[[The Car]]'' (1977), ''[[Capricorn One]]'' (1978, in which he costarred with [[Elliott Gould]], Streisand's ex-husband), ''[[The Amityville Horror (1979 film)|The Amityville Horror]]'' (1979), ''[[Night of the Juggler]]'' (1980), and ''[[High Risk (1981 film)|High Risk]]'' (1981). When [[Roger Moore]] expressed his desire to vacate the role of [[Production of the James Bond films|James Bond]], Brolin undertook screen tests to replace him in''[[Octopussy]]'' (1983). It has been reported that not only were these successful, but Brolin was actually on the point of moving to London to begin work on the film when the producers persuaded Moore to continue.<ref>{{cite web |last=Jacks |first=Kelso |date=7 April 2020 |title=Roger Moore Was Almost Replaced As James Bond: Watch James Brolin's Audition |url=https://www.screenrant.com/james-bond-roger-moore-replaced-james-brolin-audition/ |website=ScreenRant |access-date=9 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n\nIn 1985, Brolin parodied his near-hiring as [[James Bond]] in the film ''[[Pee-Wee's Big Adventure]]''. In a film within the film, he merged the characters of Bond and Pee-Wee Herman, the \"real\" version of whom was played by Paul Reubens. He is referred to as \"PW\" and the role of [[Pee-Wee Herman]]'s girlfriend \"Dottie\" is played by [[Morgan Fairchild]].\n\n==Television==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=August 2018}} \n[[File:James Brolin Kiley Marcus Welby 1969.JPG|thumb|Brolin as Steven Kiley<br />in ''[[Marcus Welby, M.D.]]'' (1969)]]\nIn 1968, Brolin transferred to [[Universal Studios]], where he auditioned for a co-starring role opposite seasoned actor [[Robert Young (actor)|Robert Young]] in the popular [[medical]] [[drama]] ''[[Marcus Welby, M.D.]]'' (1969\u20131976). The series was one of the top-rated television shows of the day. Brolin became widely known for his portrayal of youthful, skilled assistant physician Dr. Steven Kiley. The chemistry between Young & Brolin clicked, and even came to attract young women for its medical interest throughout the show's run. In its first season in 1970, Brolin won the [[Emmy]] Award for Outstanding Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role, and was subsequently nominated three more times. He was also nominated for [[Golden Globes]] three times for Best Supporting Actor, and won twice between 1971 and 1973. Brolin also starred in the [[television film]]s ''[[Short Walk to Daylight]]'' (1972) and ''[[Trapped (1973 film)|Trapped]]'' (1973). He and his first wife Jane also appeared on several episodes of the 1970s game show ''[[Tattletales]]''.\n\nIn 1983, Brolin returned to television to star in another series and teamed with producer [[Aaron Spelling]]'s [[prime-time]] [[soap opera]], ''[[Hotel (American TV series)|Hotel]]'', for [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]].<ref name=NYT>{{cite newspaper|work=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/05/arts/bette-davis-joins-abc-s-fall-lineup.html|date=May 5, 1983|page=C00032|title=BETTE DAVIS JOINS ABC'S FALL LINEUP|author=Bedell, Sally}}</ref> On ''Hotel'' Brolin played Peter McDermott, a hotel manager.<ref name=NYT2>{{cite newspaper|newspaper=The New York Times|date=September 21, 1983|page=C00026|title=TV: ABC OPENS NEW 'HOTEL' SERIES|author=O'Connor, John J.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/21/arts/tv-abc-opens-new-hotel-series.html}}</ref>\n\nFor ''Hotel'' Brolin was nominated twice for [[Golden Globes]] between 1983 and 1984 for Best Performance By an Actor in a TV Series, but did not win either time. He would eventually serve as a director on the show, as well. On one episode of ''Hotel'', he invited his future wife [[Jan Smithers]] to guest-star on the show as the writers suggested that they develop a storyline for them, as Brolin was going through a difficult divorce at the time. By 1988, after 5 seasons, ''Hotel'' was about to close its doors for good and the show was cancelled. That same year, his co-star, Nathan Cook had died of an allergic reaction to penicillin, and Brolin along with the rest of his cast attended his funeral.\n\nActress [[Connie Sellecca]] said of Brolin's on-screen chemistry with her on ''Hotel'', \"I remember instantly feeling comfortable with Jim, and that's the thing that Jim has as to women, most women, they need to feel safe, and Jim gets that.\" She also said, \"To have him in a different role and have that confidence, it was a wonderful experience.\" After the show's cancellation, Sellecca continues to be good friends with Brolin. In 1992, her mentor was in attendance at her wedding to [[John Tesh]].\n\nAs the new decade approached, Brolin starred in both ''Angel Falls'' for [[CBS]] and ''Extreme'' for [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], although neither matched the popularity of his earlier series.\n\nIn 1997, Brolin's luck changed with the syndicated television series ''[[Pensacola: Wings of Gold]]''. He played the role of Lt. Col. Bill \"Raven\" Kelly, whose job was to teach young Marines in a special unit, before being promoted to work with a group of talented Marine fighter pilots. Brolin served as an executive producer and director on the series. In 2000, however, the show was cancelled after 66 episodes due to low ratings.\n\nIn 1997, he also hosted ''[[Beyond Belief: Fact or Fiction]]'', a television series that shows five stories which have to do with the paranormal and supernatural. [[Jonathan Frakes]] took his place after the first season of the show.\n\nIn 1997, Brolin guest-starred on ''[[Roseanne]]''. In Part 1 (\"Lanford's Elite\"), Roseanne & Jackie go to a luncheon at the Lanford Country Club, where they meet the son of their old boss Edgar Wellman Jr. (Brolin) of the Wellman Plastics factory. It appears that the factory is in need of financial help and Roseanne's money could save the factory. In Part 2 (\"Some Enchanted Merger\"), once the Wellman Plastics buyout is completed, Roseanne is at a loss for what to do when a mutual attraction springs between herself and Wellman.\n\n==Since 2000==\nBrolin has had a number of supporting roles in major cinema releases since 2000. These include (amongst others) the role of General Ralph Landry, outgoing director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy in [[Steven Soderbergh]]'s Oscar-winning ''[[Traffic (2000 film)|Traffic]]'' (2000); as Jack Barnes in Steven Spielberg's ''[[Catch Me If You Can]]'' (2002); a minor role in the 2003 comedy ''[[A Guy Thing]]''; as philandering husband Robert Hatch in the 2006 comedy ''[[The Alibi]]'' (released in the UK as ''Lies and Alibis''); as Jack Jennings in the 2007 film ''The American Standards''; as TV network anchor Frank Harris in Richard Shepard's ''[[The Hunting Party (2007 film)|The Hunting Party]]'' (2007); and as Brian in [[Joel Hopkins]]' 2008 film ''[[Last Chance Harvey]]'' with Emma Thompson and Dustin Hoffman.\n\nIn 2002, Brolin played Governor [[Robert Ritchie (TV character)|Robert Ritchie]] of Florida, the Republican opponent of President [[Jed Bartlet]], on the TV series [[The West Wing (TV series)|''The West Wing'']].\n\nIn late 2003, Brolin portrayed [[Ronald Reagan]] in the television film ''[[The Reagans]]''. The film was originally meant to air on CBS, but after creative differences, scripts controversies, and rising costs, CBS passed on the film, and it aired on cable channel [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]], also owned by [[Viacom (2005\u2013present)|Viacom]]. The role earned Brolin his fifth [[Emmy Award]] nomination, as well as his fifth [[Golden Globe]] nomination.\n\nIn 2005, Brolin guest starred on the TV series ''Monk'' as casino owner Daniel Thorn. In 2006, Brolin appeared in the [[A&E Network]] film ''[[Wedding Wars]]'', playing an anti-[[gay marriage]] governor. In 2008, Brolin guest starred on ''[[Law & Order: SVU]]'' as astronaut Col. Dick Finley. The same year, Brolin also starred in the lead role in the Sci-Fi Channel film ''[[Lost City Raiders]]''.\n\nBrolin appeared in the 2009 comedy film ''[[The Goods: Live Hard, Sell Hard]]''.\n\nHe also appeared in a 2009 episode of ''[[Psych]]'', titled \"High Noon-ish\", in which he played the sheriff of a tourist-attracting \"Wild West\" town. The episode was in part a parody of the 1973 film ''[[Westworld (film)|Westworld]]'', in which he had starred.\n\nBrolin has played [[Richard Castle]]'s mysterious father in two episodes of ABC's [[Castle (TV series)|''Castle'']], in 2013 and 2014.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ausiello |first=Michael |url=http://tvline.com/2013/01/22/castle-season-5-scoop-james-brolin-castles-father/ |title=Castle Scoop: Look Who's Playing Rick's Dad! |publisher=TVLine |date=2013-01-22 |accessdate=2016-08-17}}</ref> He appeared in the NBC sitcom ''[[Community (TV series)|Community]]'' as William Winger, Jeff Winger's estranged father.\n\nFrom 2015 until 2019, he played the role of John, the family patriarch, in the CBS comedy ''[[Life in Pieces]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbs.com/shows/life-in-pieces/ |title=Life in Pieces |website=CBS.com |date= |accessdate=2016-08-17}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:Barbra Streisand and James Brolin.jpg|thumb|[[Barbra Streisand]] with Brolin (2013) ]]\nBrolin has been married three times and has three children.\n\nIn 1966, he married Jane Cameron Agee, a wildlife activist and aspiring actress at [[Twentieth Century Fox]], 12 days after they first met.<ref name=PlayboyInt>{{cite journal|author= Stephen Rebello|date=October 2010|title= Playboy Interview: Josh Brolin|journal= [[Playboy (magazine)|Playboy]]}}</ref>  The couple had two children, [[Josh Brolin|Josh]] (b. 1968), and Jess (b. 1972).

After success in several celebrity auto races, he entered the 1979 [[24 Hours N\u00fcrburgring]] as part of the [[AMC Spirit]] team. Brolin's two-car team, which included accomplished female racer [[Lyn St. James]], finished both 1st and 2nd in class.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.hemmings.com/mus/stories/2005/02/01/hmn_feature17.html |last=Mattar |first=George |title=AMC Invades Germany \u2013 circa 1979 |journal=Hemmings Muscle Machines |date=February 2005 |accessdate=20 April 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.roadandtrack.com/motorsports/news/a29623/when-the-americans-conquered-the-nurburgring-with-a-amc-spirit/ |title=When the Americans Conquered the Nurburgring with an AMC Spirit |publisher=R&T Magazine |accessdate=January 30, 2019}}</ref> \n\nIn 1985, Brolin met actress [[Jan Smithers]] on the set of ''Hotel'', and they married in 1986.
