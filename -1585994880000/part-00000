His later works were more [[abstract art|abstract]]. His key influence related to bold use of colour and a clear love of experimentation with both depth and [[Lightness (color)|tone]].\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life===\nRobert Delaunay was born in [[Paris]], the son of George Delaunay and [[Count]]ess Berthe F\u00e9licie de Rose. While he was a child, Delaunay's parents divorced, and he was raised by his mother's sister Marie and her husband Charles Damour, in La Ronch\u00e8re near [[Bourges]]. When he failed his final exam and said he wanted to become a painter, his uncle in 1902 sent him to Ronsin's [[atelier]] to study [[Decorative Arts]] in the [[Belleville, Paris|Belleville]] district of Paris.<ref>[[#hd95|D\u00fcchting]]: p7</ref> At age 19, he left Ronsin to focus entirely on painting and contributed six works to the [[Salon des Ind\u00e9pendants]] in 1904.<ref name=kh>Robert Delaunay \u2013 Sonia Delaunay, 1999, {{ISBN|3-7701-5216-6}}</ref>\n\nHe traveled to [[Brittany]], where he was influenced by the [[Pont-Aven School|group of Pont-Aven]]; and, in 1906, he contributed works he painted in Brittany to the 22nd Salon des Ind\u00e9pendants, where he met [[Henri Rousseau]].<ref name=kh/>\n\nDelaunay formed a close friendship at this time with [[Jean Metzinger]], with whom he shared an [[Art exhibition|exhibition]] at a [[Art gallery|gallery]] run by Berthe Weill early in 1907. The two of them were singled out by the [[art critic]] [[Louis Vauxcelles]] in 1907 as [[Divisionism|Divisionists]] who used large, mosaic-like 'cubes' to construct small but highly symbolic compositions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.all-art.org/art_20th_century/metzinger1.html|title=History of Art: Jean Metzinger|website=www.all-art.org}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Robert Delaunay, c.1906, Paysage au disque solaire, oil on canvas, 54 x 46 cm, Mus\u00e9e National d'Art Moderne.jpg|thumb|Robert Delaunay, ''Paysage au disque'', 1906\u201307, oil on canvas, 55 x 46 cm, Mus\u00e9e national d'art moderne (MNAM), Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris]]\nRobert Herbert writes: \"Metzinger's [[Neo-Impressionist]] period was somewhat longer than that of his close friend Delaunay... The height of his Neo-Impressionist work was in 1906 and 1907, when he and Delaunay did portraits of each other (Art market, London, and Museum of Fine Arts, Houston) in prominent rectangles of pigment.

[[Piet Mondrian]] developed a similar mosaic-like Divisionist technique circa 1909. The [[Futurists]] later (1909\u20131916) would incorporate the style, under the influence of [[Gino Severini]]'s Parisian works (from 1907 onward), into their dynamic paintings and sculpture.<ref name=\"Robert Herbert\" />\n\n[[File:Delaunay ChampDeMars.jpg|thumb|Robert Delaunay.

From 1912 to 1914, he painted nonfigurative paintings based on the optical characteristics of brilliant colors that were so dynamic they would function as the form. His theories are mostly concerned with color and light and influenced many, including [[Stanton Macdonald-Wright]], [[Morgan Russell]], [[Patrick Henry Bruce]], [[Der Blaue Reiter]], [[August Macke]], [[Franz Marc]], [[Paul Klee]], and [[Lyonel Feininger]]. [[Apollinaire]] was strongly influenced by Delaunay's theories of color and often quoted from them to explain Orphism. Delaunay's fixations with color as the expressive and structural means were sustained by his study of color.\n\nHis writings on color, which were influenced by scientists and theoreticians, are intuitive and can sometimes be random statements based on the belief that color is a thing in itself, with its own powers of expression and form. He believes painting is a purely visual art that depends on intellectual elements, and perception is in the impact of colored light on the eye. The contrasts and harmonies of color produce in the eye simultaneous movements and correspond to movement in nature. Vision becomes the subject of painting.\n\nHis early paintings are deeply rooted in [[Neoimpressionism]]. ''Night Scene'', for example, has vigorous activity, with the use of lively brushstrokes in bright colors against a dark background, not defining solid objects but the areas that surround them.\n\nThe spectral colors of Neoimpressionism were later abandoned. The ''Eiffel Tower'' series represented the fragmentation of solid objects and their merging with space. Influences in this series were C\u00e9zanne, Analytical Cubism, and Futurism. In the ''Eiffel Tower'' the interpenetration of tangible objects and surrounding space is accompanied by the intense movement of geometric planes that are more dynamic than the static equilibrium of Cubist forms.\n\nIn 1908, after a term in the military working as a regimental librarian, he met [[Sonia Terk]]; at the time she was married to a German art dealer whom she would soon divorce. In 1909, Delaunay began to paint a series of studies of the city of Paris and the [[Eiffel Tower]], the [[Eiffel Tower (Delaunay series)|''Eiffel Tower'' series]].\n\nThe following year, he married Terk, and the couple settled in a studio apartment in Paris, where their son [[Charles Delaunay|Charles]] was born in January 1911. The same year, at the invitation of [[Wassily Kandinsky]], Delaunay joined The Blue Rider ([[Der Blaue Reiter]]), a [[Munich]]-based group of artists. Delaunay was also successful in Germany, Switzerland, and Russia. He participated in the first Blanc Reiter exhibition in Munich and sold four works. Delaunay's paintings encouraged an enthusiastic response with Blaue Reiter. The Blaue Reiter connections led to Erwin Ritter von Busse's article \"Robert Delaunay\u2019s Methods of Compositions\" which appeared in the 1912 ''Blaue Reiter Almanac''. Delaunay would go to exhibit in February of that year, in the second Blaue Reiter exhibition in Munich and Valet de Carrean in Moscow.\n\n[[Image:Robert Delaunay, 1913, Premier Disque, 134 cm, 52.7 inches, Private collection.jpg|thumb|200px|Robert Delaunay.

On March 13 his first major exhibition in Paris closed after two weeks at the [[Galerie Barbazanges]]. The exhibition showed forty-six works from his early Impressionist works to his Cubist Eiffel Tower painting from 1909\u20131911.\nArt Critic Guillaume Apollinaire praised those works of the exhibition and proclaimed Delaunay as \"an artist who has a monumental vision of the world.\"\n\nIn the March 23, 1912, issue of ''L'Assiette au Beurre'', The first published suggestion that Delaunay had broken with this group of Cubists appeared, in James Burkley's review of that year's Salon des Ind\u00e9pendants. \nBurkley wrote, \"The Cubists, who occupy only a room, have multiplied. Their leaders, Picasso and Braque, have not participated in their grouping, and Delaunay, commonly labeled a Cubist, has wished to isolate himself and declare that he has nothing in common with Metzinger or Le Fauconnier.\"\n\nWith [[Apollinaire]], Delaunay traveled to [[Berlin]] in January 1913 for an exhibition of his work at [[Der Sturm|Galerie Der Sturm]].

His later works were more [[abstract art|abstract]]. His key influence related to bold use of colour and a clear love of experimentation with both depth and [[Lightness (color)|tone]].\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life===\nRobert Delaunay was born in [[Paris]], the son of George Delaunay and [[Count]]ess Berthe F\u00e9licie de Rose. While he was a child, Delaunay's parents divorced, and he was raised by his mother's sister Marie and her husband Charles Damour, in La Ronch\u00e8re near [[Bourges]]. When he failed his final exam and said he wanted to become a painter, his uncle in 1902 sent him to Ronsin's [[atelier]] to study [[Decorative Arts]] in the [[Belleville, Paris|Belleville]] district of Paris.<ref>[[#hd95|D\u00fcchting]]: p7</ref> At age 19, he left Ronsin to focus entirely on painting and contributed six works to the [[Salon des Ind\u00e9pendants]] in 1904.<ref name=kh>Robert Delaunay \u2013 Sonia Delaunay, 1999, {{ISBN|3-7701-5216-6}}</ref>\n\nHe traveled to [[Brittany]], where he was influenced by the [[Pont-Aven School|group of Pont-Aven]]; and, in 1906, he contributed works he painted in Brittany to the 22nd Salon des Ind\u00e9pendants, where he met [[Henri Rousseau]].<ref name=kh/>\n\nDelaunay formed a close friendship at this time with [[Jean Metzinger]], with whom he shared an [[Art exhibition|exhibition]] at a [[Art gallery|gallery]] run by Berthe Weill early in 1907. The two of them were singled out by the [[art critic]] [[Louis Vauxcelles]] in 1907 as [[Divisionism|Divisionists]] who used large, mosaic-like 'cubes' to construct small but highly symbolic compositions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.all-art.org/art_20th_century/metzinger1.html|title=History of Art: Jean Metzinger|website=www.all-art.org}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Robert Delaunay, c.1906, Paysage au disque solaire, oil on canvas, 54 x 46 cm, Mus\u00e9e National d'Art Moderne.jpg|thumb|Robert Delaunay, ''Paysage au disque'', 1906\u201307, oil on canvas, 55 x 46 cm, Mus\u00e9e national d'art moderne (MNAM), Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris]]\nRobert Herbert writes: \"Metzinger's [[Neo-Impressionist]] period was somewhat longer than that of his close friend Delaunay...

From 1912 to 1914, he painted nonfigurative paintings based on the optical characteristics of brilliant colors that were so dynamic they would function as the form. His theories are mostly concerned with color and light and influenced many, including [[Stanton Macdonald-Wright]], [[Morgan Russell]], [[Patrick Henry Bruce]], [[Der Blaue Reiter]], [[August Macke]], [[Franz Marc]], [[Paul Klee]], and [[Lyonel Feininger]]. [[Apollinaire]] was strongly influenced by Delaunay's theories of color and often quoted from them to explain Orphism. Delaunay's fixations with color as the expressive and structural means were sustained by his study of color.\n\nHis writings on color, which were influenced by scientists and theoreticians, are intuitive and can sometimes be random statements based on the belief that color is a thing in itself, with its own powers of expression and form. He believes painting is a purely visual art that depends on intellectual elements, and perception is in the impact of colored light on the eye. The contrasts and harmonies of color produce in the eye simultaneous movements and correspond to movement in nature. Vision becomes the subject of painting.\n\nHis early paintings are deeply rooted in [[Neoimpressionism]]. ''Night Scene'', for example, has vigorous activity, with the use of lively brushstrokes in bright colors against a dark background, not defining solid objects but the areas that surround them.\n\nThe spectral colors of Neoimpressionism were later abandoned. The ''Eiffel Tower'' series represented the fragmentation of solid objects and their merging with space. Influences in this series were C\u00e9zanne, Analytical Cubism, and Futurism. In the ''Eiffel Tower'' the interpenetration of tangible objects and surrounding space is accompanied by the intense movement of geometric planes that are more dynamic than the static equilibrium of Cubist forms.\n\nIn 1908, after a term in the military working as a regimental librarian, he met [[Sonia Terk]]; at the time she was married to a German art dealer whom she would soon divorce. In 1909, Delaunay began to paint a series of studies of the city of Paris and the [[Eiffel Tower]], the [[Eiffel Tower (Delaunay series)|''Eiffel Tower'' series]].\n\nThe following year, he married Terk, and the couple settled in a studio apartment in Paris, where their son [[Charles Delaunay|Charles]] was born in January 1911. The same year, at the invitation of [[Wassily Kandinsky]], Delaunay joined The Blue Rider ([[Der Blaue Reiter]]), a [[Munich]]-based group of artists. Delaunay was also successful in Germany, Switzerland, and Russia. He participated in the first Blanc Reiter exhibition in Munich and sold four works. Delaunay's paintings encouraged an enthusiastic response with Blaue Reiter. The Blaue Reiter connections led to Erwin Ritter von Busse's article \"Robert Delaunay\u2019s Methods of Compositions\" which appeared in the 1912 ''Blaue Reiter Almanac''. Delaunay would go to exhibit in February of that year, in the second Blaue Reiter exhibition in Munich and Valet de Carrean in Moscow.\n\n[[Image:Robert Delaunay, 1913, Premier Disque, 134 cm, 52.7 inches, Private collection.jpg|thumb|200px|Robert Delaunay.

On March 13 his first major exhibition in Paris closed after two weeks at the [[Galerie Barbazanges]]. The exhibition showed forty-six works from his early Impressionist works to his Cubist Eiffel Tower painting from 1909\u20131911.\nArt Critic Guillaume Apollinaire praised those works of the exhibition and proclaimed Delaunay as \"an artist who has a monumental vision of the world.\"\n\nIn the March 23, 1912, issue of ''L'Assiette au Beurre'', The first published suggestion that Delaunay had broken with this group of Cubists appeared, in James Burkley's review of that year's Salon des Ind\u00e9pendants. \nBurkley wrote, \"The Cubists, who occupy only a room, have multiplied. Their leaders, Picasso and Braque, have not participated in their grouping, and Delaunay, commonly labeled a Cubist, has wished to isolate himself and declare that he has nothing in common with Metzinger or Le Fauconnier.\"\n\nWith [[Apollinaire]], Delaunay traveled to [[Berlin]] in January 1913 for an exhibition of his work at [[Der Sturm|Galerie Der Sturm]]. On their way back to Paris, the two stayed with [[August Macke]] in [[Bonn]], where Macke introduced them to [[Max Ernst]].<ref name=wb>Willard Bohn: Apollinaire and the international avant-garde (1997), {{ISBN|0-7914-3195-9}}, p82</ref> When his painting ''La ville de Paris'' was rejected by the [[Armory Show]] as being too big<ref>''La ville de Paris'' measures 234 x 294 cm.</ref> he instructed [[Samuel Halpert]] to remove all his works from the show.<ref name=kh/>\n\n===Spanish and Portuguese years (1914\u20131920)===\nAt the outbreak of the [[World War I|First World War]] in 1914 Sonia and Robert were staying in [[Fontarabie]] in Spain. They decided not to return to France and settled in Madrid. In August 1915 they moved to Portugal where they shared a home with [[Samuel Halpert]] and [[Eduardo Viana]].<ref>Some sources mention an Eduardo Vianna</ref> With Viana and their friends [[Amadeo de Souza Cardoso]] (whom the Delaunays had already met in Paris) and [[Jos\u00e9 de Almada Negreiros]] they discussed an artistic partnership.<ref name=kh/><ref>[[#hd95|D\u00fcchting]]: p51</ref> First declared a [[deserter]], Robert was declared unfit for military duty at the French consulate in [[Vigo]] on June 13, 1916.<ref name=kh/>\n\nThe [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]] brought an end to the financial support Sonia received from her family in Russia, and a different source of income was needed. In 1917 the Delaunays met [[Diaghilev|Sergei Diaghilev]] in Madrid. Robert designed the stage for his production of ''Cleopatra'' (costume design by [[Sonia Delaunay]]).

Delaunay continued to work in both figurative and abstract themes, with a brief stint into [[Surrealism]]. Delaunay met [[Andr\u00e9 Breton]] and [[Tristan Tzara]], who introduced him to both [[Dada|Dadaists]] and Surrealists.<ref>[https://www.museothyssen.org/en/collection/artists/delaunay-robert Robert Delaunay, Museo Nacional Thyssen-Bornemisza]</ref> During the [[Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne (1937)|1937 World Fair in Paris]], Delaunay participated in the design of the railway and air travel pavilions.  When [[World War II]] erupted, the Delaunays moved to the [[Auvergne (province)|Auvergne]], in an effort to avoid the invading [[Germany|German]] forces. Suffering from [[cancer]], Delaunay was unable to endure being moved around, and his health deteriorated. He died from cancer on 25 October 1941 in [[Montpellier]] at the age of 56.

It is part of [[Island County, Washington]], and is located between [[Whidbey Island]] and the mainland ([[Snohomish County, Washington|Snohomish County]]) by the [[Saratoga Passage]] to the west and [[Port Susan]] and Davis Slough to the east. The island has one road connection to the mainland, via [[Washington State Route 532|State Route 532]] over the [[Camano Gateway Bridge]] at the northeast end of the island, connecting to the city of [[Stanwood, Washington|Stanwood]].\n\nThe island has a total area of {{convert|39.77|sqmi|sqkm}}, making it one of the largest in the state of Washington. It has a year-round population of 15,661 as of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. The population peaks at over 17,000 during the summer months due to the presence of \"[[snowbird (people)|snowbirds]]\" and other part-time residents with vacation homes on the island. It is an [[unincorporated area]] with several small communities and shares civic facilities with nearby Stanwood, including its [[school district]], [[post office]], and emergency services.\n\nCamano Island is home to two state parks, [[Cama Beach State Park|Cama Beach]] and [[Camano Island State Park]], and several county and local parks.\n\n==History==\n\n===Etymology===\n\nCamano Island was named in 1790 for the [[Spain|Spanish]] explorer [[Jacinto Caama\u00f1o]] by compatriot [[Francisco de Eliza]], who mapped [[Admiralty Inlet]].<ref name=\"Meany\">{{cite book |last=Meany |first=Edmond S. |authorlink=Edmond S.

Following this theme, Wilkes named the body of water between Camano and Whidbey Island after MacDonough's flagship the ''[[USS Saratoga (1814)|Saratoga]]''. When [[Henry Kellett]] reorganized the official British Admiralty charts in 1847, he removed Wilkes' name ''MacDonough'' and bestowed the name ''Camano'', which the Spanish had originally given to [[Admiralty Inlet]] in 1790.

In 1945, two-thirds of all jobs in Sydney were located in the [[City of Sydney]] and surrounding inner city municipalities, but post-war suburbanisation meant that only a quarter of the workforce were located in the City, [[City of South Sydney|South Sydney]], [[Leichhardt, New South Wales|Leichhardt]] and Marrickville municipalities. \n\nWith a boom in passenger railway construction came rapid extension of the suburbs along the railway corridors to the west and south, and eventually to the North Shore, after the completion of the Harbour Bridge allowed trains to continue from [[North Sydney, New South Wales|North Sydney]] into the CBD. This radial-spoke pattern of development changed after World War II, when increasing car ownership encouraged infill development where the railways didn't run, and then further expansion around the perimeter of the city. These outer areas have mostly missed out on further rail expansion and are primarily car dependent to this day.<ref>Spearitt, Peter, 2000, ''Sydney's Century: A History'' p. 122,  Sydney: UNSW Press</ref>\n\n== Financial centre ==\n[[File:Sydney, Australia.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Sydney CBD]] is Australia's largest financial centre.]]\nSydney is a leading financial centre in the [[Asia-Pacific]] region.<ref>Daly, M.

Sydney has the largest economy in Australia.\n\n[[Sydney CBD|Sydney's CBD]] is the largest in Australia and also has plenty of surrounding commercial areas which are considered part of Sydney.

[[20th Century Fox]] has large Sydney studios.\n\n==History==\nAlthough the CBD dominated the city's business and cultural life in the early days, other business/cultural districts have developed in a radial pattern since [[World War II]]. In 1945, two-thirds of all jobs in Sydney were located in the [[City of Sydney]] and surrounding inner city municipalities, but post-war suburbanisation meant that only a quarter of the workforce were located in the City, [[City of South Sydney|South Sydney]], [[Leichhardt, New South Wales|Leichhardt]] and Marrickville municipalities. \n\nWith a boom in passenger railway construction came rapid extension of the suburbs along the railway corridors to the west and south, and eventually to the North Shore, after the completion of the Harbour Bridge allowed trains to continue from [[North Sydney, New South Wales|North Sydney]] into the CBD. This radial-spoke pattern of development changed after World War II, when increasing car ownership encouraged infill development where the railways didn't run, and then further expansion around the perimeter of the city. These outer areas have mostly missed out on further rail expansion and are primarily car dependent to this day.<ref>Spearitt, Peter, 2000, ''Sydney's Century: A History'' p. 122,  Sydney: UNSW Press</ref>\n\n== Financial centre ==\nSydney is a leading financial centre in the [[Asia-Pacific]] region.<ref>Daly, M.

Compared to Naples, Genoa is one-sided. Naples has the greatest splendor alongside the greatest misery. Port life, carriage ride, high-level opera house, even a piece of Rome: the National Museum. Beside this the heavenly nature, unmatched. The sea of \u200b\u200bGenoa more imposing, but also more monotonous. Here a placid cove, framed by strange mountains and closed by characteristic islands. And all I can see from the balcony of my room. Like a giant amphitheater, the wonderful city with its intense buzz lies at my feet. On the left the old city with the docks of the port and the ancient Vesuvius, on the right the modern Villa Nazionale and Posillipo. All around the house there are gardens of fresh green, fantastic shapes and myriads of flowers. Salita del Petraio, Villa De Rosa 48, Pensione Haase, Naples, is called this fabulous panoramic lookout. The sea is wonderfully blue and calm. The city is a lively picture of clarity, facades of blocks of houses, in the light and darkness, white streets, sections of dark green parks.

Compared to Naples, Genoa is one-sided. Naples has the greatest splendor alongside the greatest misery. Port life, carriage ride, high-level opera house, even a piece of Rome: the National Museum. Beside this the heavenly nature, unmatched. The sea of \u200b\u200bGenoa more imposing, but also more monotonous. Here a placid cove, framed by strange mountains and closed by characteristic islands. And all I can see from the balcony of my room. Like a giant amphitheater, the wonderful city with its intense buzz lies at my feet. On the left the old city with the docks of the port and the ancient Vesuvius, on the right the modern Villa Nazionale and Posillipo. All around the house there are gardens of fresh green, fantastic shapes and myriads of flowers. Salita del Petraio, Villa De Rosa 48, Pensione Haase, Naples, is called this fabulous panoramic lookout. The sea is wonderfully blue and calm. The city is a lively picture of clarity, facades of blocks of houses, in the light and darkness, white streets, sections of dark green parks.

The [[Tonkin Expeditionary Corps]], under the command of General [[Louis Bri\u00e8re de l'Isle]], defeated the Chinese [[Guangxi Army]] and captured the strategically important town of [[L\u1ea1ng S\u01a1n]] in a ten-day campaign mounted under formidable logistical constraints.<ref>Thomazi, ''Conqu\u00eate'', 243\u20136</ref>\n\n== Campaign preparations, January 1885  ==\n{{main|Battle of N\u00fai Bop}}\n[[Image:Lang Son Campaign.jpg|thumb|left|260px|The L\u1ea1ng S\u01a1n campaign, February 1885]]\nFrench strategy in [[Tonkin]] was the subject of a bitter debate in the Chamber of Deputies in late December 1884. The army minister General Jean-Baptiste-Marie Campenon argued that the French should consolidate their hold on the [[Red River Delta|Delta]]. His opponents urged an all-out offensive to throw the Chinese out of northern Tonkin. The debate culminated in Campenon's resignation and his replacement as army minister by the hawkish General [[Jules Lewal]].  On 5 January 1885 Lewal ordered Bri\u00e8re de l'Isle to 'capture L\u1ea1ng S\u01a1n as soon as possible'.<ref>Thomazi, ''Conqu\u00eate'', 242\u20133</ref>\n\nLong-range planning for a campaign against L\u1ea1ng S\u01a1n had been underway for several months, and Bri\u00e8re de l'Isle had already assembled large French forces at the French forward base of Chu on the [[L\u1ee5c Nam River|Luc Nam]] River, which had been occupied by the French in the wake of the [[Kep campaign]] (October 1884).  On 3 and 4 January 1885 General de N\u00e9grier attacked and defeated a substantial detachment of the Guangxi Army that had concentrated around the nearby village of [[N\u00fai Bop]] to try to disrupt the French preparations. De N\u00e8grier's victory at N\u00fai Bop, won at odds of just under one to ten, was regarded by his fellow-officers as the most spectacular professional triumph of his career.<ref>Armengaud, 2\u20134; Bonifacy, 8\u20139; Dreyfus, 81\u20136; Harmant, 113\u201337; Lecomte, ''Lang-Son'', 155\u201376; ''Vie militaire'', 79\u201386; Maury, 129\u201332; Nicolas, 362\u20137; Sarrat, 169\u201370</ref>\n\nLogistical arrangements for the L\u1ea1ng S\u01a1n campaign were formidable.  It would take the column around ten days to advance to the outskirts of L\u1ea1ng S\u01a1n.  The troops would be burdened with the weight of their provisions and equipment, and would have to march through extremely difficult country.  The nights, in Tonkin in February, would be bitterly cold.  Supplying the column with food and ammunition would tax the ingenuity of the marine infantry officers responsible for the mule trains and the coolies.  It took the French a month to complete their preparations for the campaign, but by the end of January 1885, Bri\u00e8re de l'Isle had assembled an expeditionary column of just under 7,200 troops, accompanied by 4,500 coolies, at Chu.<ref>Lecomte, ''Lang-Son'', 177\u2013206; Sarrat, 171\u20137</ref>\n\n== French high command, L\u1ea1ng S\u01a1n campaign ==\n<gallery>\nImage:Louis Briere de lIsle.jpg|General Louis Bri\u00e8re de l'Isle (1827\u201396)\nImage:Fran\u00e7ois Oscar de N\u00e9grier.jpg|General Fran\u00e7ois de N\u00e9grier (1842\u20131913)\nFile:Ange-Laurent Giovanninelli.jpg|Colonel Ange-Laurent Giovanninelli (1839\u20131903)\n</gallery>\n\n== French order of battle ==\nThe L\u1ea1ng S\u01a1n expeditionary column (''colonne exp\u00e9ditionnaire de Lang-Son'') was organised around the two brigades originally established by General Millot in January 1885.

At Cao Nhiat the French captured an important Chinese rice dump, easing their supply difficulties.<ref>Armengaud, 7; Bonifacy, 13; Lecomte, ''Lang-Son'', 227\u201330; ''Vie militaire'', 107\u201312; Nicolas, 369</ref>\n\n===Battle of Tay Hoa, 4 February===\n\n[[Image:Herbinger painting.jpg|thumb|left|260px|Lieutenant-Colonel [[Paul-Gustave Herbinger]] (detail from a painting by Albert Bligny)]]\n[[Image:Map of Tay Hoa.jpg|thumb|right|160px|Map of the battle of Tay Hoa, 4 February 1885]]\nOn 4 February the expeditionary corps fought its first action with the Chinese, at Tay Hoa.  The battle was fought almost wholly by de N\u00e9grier's 2nd Brigade, which was leading the march, and demonstrated the unfitness for field command of Lieutenant-Colonel Paul-Gustave Herbinger, the French commander who would in late March 1885 give the controversial order for the [[Retreat from L\u1ea1ng S\u01a1n]].  Ordered to capture the 'Great Fort', the key to the Chinese position, with his three French line battalions, Herbinger made an elaborate flank march which exhausted his troops and wasted valuable time.  At length, seeing his operational timetable threatened, de N\u00e9grier ordered Schoeffer's 3rd Legion Battalion to take the fort instead.  The legionnaires scrambled rapidly up the mountain paths towards the Chinese position and captured it under Herbinger's nose.  Meanwhile, on the other side of the battlefield, Captain Gravereau's company of Diguet's 2nd Legion Battalion was isolated and surrounded by the Chinese.  The company was eventually disengaged by its comrades, but suffered heavy losses.  Although the battle was indisputably a French victory, French casualties were disconcertingly heavy: 18 dead and 101 wounded, most of them in Diguet and Schoeffer's Legion battalions.  These were the heaviest casualties the French had suffered in a single engagement since the start of the Sino-French War.<ref>Armengaud, 8\u201312; Bonifacy, 13\u201314; Harmant, 141\u20139; Lecomte, ''Lang-Son'', 230\u201340; ''Vie militaire'', 112\u201319; Maury, 134\u20137; Nicolas, 369\u201371</ref>\n\n===Actions at Ha Hoa and Dong Song, 5 and 6 February===\n\nOn 5 February the French assaulted the main complex of forts defending the Chinese entrenched camp at Dong Song, around Ha Hoa.  The two French brigades attacked side by side.  The 1st Brigade, on the left, overran a number of Chinese forts before their defenders could escape, and wiped out the garrisons by blowing in the roofs with dynamite.  The 2nd Brigade, on the right, captured the principal Chinese work of Pins Parasols, so named because it had been built around a conspicuous clump of umbrella pines.  The speed of the French attacks, prepared by artillery, kept the Chinese off balance throughout the battle, and French casualties were relatively low: 4 dead and 18 wounded.<ref>Armengaud, 12\u201314; Bonifacy, 14\u201315; Harmant, 149\u201350; Lecomte, ''Lang-Son'', 241\u201350; ''Vie militaire'', 120\u20134; Maury, 137\u20138; Nicolas, 371</ref>\n\nOn 6 February the French fought a morning action to clear the Chinese from their last defences before Dong Song, and took possession of the entrenched camp of Dong Song in the afternoon.  French casualties in this action were 3 dead and 41 wounded.  Bri\u00e8re de l'Isle had been hoping to push the Chinese back across the mountain of Deo Quao into the Song Thuong valley, away from L\u1ea1ng S\u01a1n, but most of the Chinese troops fell back up the Dong Song valley to Pho Bu, where they could make a further stand for L\u1ea1ng S\u01a1n.<ref>Armengaud, 15\u201316; Bonifacy, 15; Harmant, 150; Lecomte, ''Lang-Son'', 250\u20138; ''Vie militaire'', 124\u20135; Maury, 138\u201342; Nicolas, 372\u20133</ref>\n\n===Action at Deo Quao, 9 February===\n\nThe capture of Dong Song threatened the supply line of the Guangxi Army's right wing at B\u1eafc L\u1ec7, and the Chinese hastily pulled back from B\u1eafc L\u1ec7 and retreated up the Mandarin Road to Thanh Moy.  To cover their retreat they attacked the French outposts on the mountain of Deo Quao on 9 February.  The French units on Deo Quao easily repelled this attack, but the diversion allowed the Guangxi Army to regroup and make a final stand in front of L\u1ea1ng S\u01a1n.<ref>Armengaud, 16\u201319; Bonifacy, 16; Harmant, 150\u20131; Lecomte, ''Lang-Son'', 273\u20136; Maury, 142\u20134</ref>\n\n===Action at Pho Vy, 11 February===\n\nAfter a pause for breath at Dong Song to resupply with food and ammunition and to establish a shorter supply line back to Chu across the mountain of Deo Quan, the Tonkin expeditionary corps pressed on towards L\u1ea1ng S\u01a1n.  On 11 February the 2nd Brigade, at the head of the French column, contacted advance elements of the Guangxi Army at Pho Vy.  The Chinese were ejected from the village of Pho Vy by Herbinger's three French battalions with little difficulty, but they brought up their reserves and mounted a counterattack against Herbinger's regiment which forced de Negrier to commit Diguet's Legion battalion to drive them off.  Towards the end of the battle the 111th Battalion stormed a Chinese hill position under the eyes of the rest of the brigade.  2nd Lieutenant Rene Normand, who fell a month later in the [[Battle of Bang Bo]] and whose letters from Tonkin were published after his death, distinguished himself in this action.  Towards evening the Chinese fell back on their main body at Bac Vie.  French casualties at Pho Vy were slight: a total of 1 dead and 23 wounded.<ref>Armengaud, 20\u20131; Harmant, 151\u20137; Lecomte, ''Lang-Son'', 277\u201388; Maury, 144\u201350; Nicolas, 373\u20134; Normand, 106\u201315, 151\u20132, 166\u20137 and 190\u20133</ref>\n\n===Battle of Bac Vie, 12 February===\n\n[[Image:Map of Bac Vie.jpg|thumb|left|160px|Map of the battle of Bac Vie, 12 February 1885]]\n[[Image:Battle of Bac Vie.jpg|thumb|right|200px|French troops advance on Chinese hill positions during the battle of Bac Vie]]\nThe culminating battle for L\u1ea1ng S\u01a1n was fought on 12 February at Bac Vie, several kilometres to the south of L\u1ea1ng S\u01a1n.  Giovanninelli's 1st Brigade was leading the French column, and de N\u00e9grier's 2nd Brigade took little part in the battle.  In a costly but successful assault, Giovanninelli's Turcos and marine infantry stormed the Chinese defences.  The battle was fought in thick fog, allowing the Chinese to mount a dangerous counterattack at one point that nearly swept away part of Giovanninelli's brigade.  Eventually the French broke through the Chinese centre, and the isolated Chinese wings retreated in disorder back to L\u1ea1ng S\u01a1n.  French casualties at Bac Vie were 30 dead and 188 wounded, the highest casualties of the campaign.  Most of these casualties were sustained by the two Turco battalions in Giovanninelli's brigade, which had borne the brunt of the battle.  ''Chef d'escadron'' Levrard, the 1st Brigade's artillery commander, was shot dead during the battle, and Bri\u00e8re de l'Isle's ''officier d'ordonnance'' 2nd Lieutenant Bossant, the son of a senior French general, was killed at Bri\u00e8re de l'Isle's side.<ref>Armengaud, 21\u20134; Harmant, 157\u20138; Lecomte, ''Lang-Son'', 288\u201398 and 304\u20135; Maury, 150\u20133; Nicolas, 374\u20138</ref>\n\n===Capture of L\u1ea1ng S\u01a1n and action at Ky Lua, 13 February===\n\nOn 13 February the French column entered L\u1ea1ng S\u01a1n, which the Chinese abandoned after fighting a token rearguard action at the nearby village of Ky Lua.  In compliment to their performance at Bac Vie, Bri\u00e8re de l'Isle gave Giovanninelli's Turcos and marine infantry the honour of leading the French entry into L\u1ea1ng S\u01a1n.

Before his departure he ordered General de N\u00e9grier, who would remain at L\u1ea1ng S\u01a1n with the 2nd Brigade, to press on towards the Chinese border and expel the battered remnants of the Guangxi Army from Tonkinese soil. After resupplying the 2nd Brigade with food and ammunition, De N\u00e9grier advanced to attack the Guangxi Army at Dong Dang.  On 23 February de N\u00e9grier stormed the Chinese defences at Dong Dang, forcing the Chinese to retreat towards the Chinese border town of Longzhou (Lung-chou, \u9f8d\u5dde).<ref>Armengaud, 28\u201335; Bonifacy, 20\u20131; Dreyfus, 117\u201320; Grisot and Coulombon, 459\u201360; Harmant, 175\u201380; Lecomte, ''Lang-Son'', 337\u201349; Maury, 159\u201372; Nicolas, 380\u201383; Normand, 122\u201334, 135\u201341 and 169\u201374</ref>\n\nAfter clearing the Chinese from Tonkinese territory the French crossed briefly into Guangxi province and on 25 February blew up the 'Gate of China', an elaborate Chinese customs building on the border at [[Friendship Gate|Zhennan Pass]] (Zhennanguan). They were not strong enough to exploit this victory, however, and de N\u00e9grier returned to L\u1ea1ng S\u01a1n with the bulk of the 2nd Brigade at the end of February.  A small French garrison under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Herbinger was left at Dong Dang to watch the movements of the Guangxi Army.  Three weeks later the Chinese attacked the Dong Dang garrison, precipitating a series of events that led to a decisive French defeat at the [[Battle of Bang Bo]] (24 March 1885).\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=Note}}\n\n== Footnotes ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n* Armengaud, J.

The [[Tonkin Expeditionary Corps]], under the command of General [[Louis Bri\u00e8re de l'Isle]], defeated the Chinese [[Guangxi Army]] and captured the strategically important town of [[L\u1ea1ng S\u01a1n]] in a ten-day campaign mounted under formidable logistical constraints.<ref>Thomazi, ''Conqu\u00eate'', 243\u20136</ref>\n\n== Campaign preparations, January 1885  ==\n{{main|Battle of N\u00fai Bop}}\n[[Image:Lang Son Campaign.jpg|thumb|left|260px|The L\u1ea1ng S\u01a1n campaign, February 1885]]\nFrench strategy in [[Tonkin]] was the subject of a bitter debate in the Chamber of Deputies in late December 1884. The army minister General Jean-Baptiste-Marie Campenon argued that the French should consolidate their hold on the [[Red River Delta|Delta]]. His opponents urged an all-out offensive to throw the Chinese out of northern Tonkin. The debate culminated in Campenon's resignation and his replacement as army minister by the hawkish General [[Jules Lewal]].  On 5 January 1885 Lewal ordered Bri\u00e8re de l'Isle to 'capture L\u1ea1ng S\u01a1n as soon as possible'.<ref>Thomazi, ''Conqu\u00eate'', 242\u20133</ref>\n\nLong-range planning for a campaign against L\u1ea1ng S\u01a1n had been underway for several months, and Bri\u00e8re de l'Isle had already assembled large French forces at the French forward base of Chu on the [[Luc Nam]] River, which had been occupied by the French in the wake of the [[Kep campaign]] (October 1884).  On 3 and 4 January 1885 General de N\u00e9grier attacked and defeated a substantial detachment of the Guangxi Army that had concentrated around the nearby village of [[N\u00fai Bop]] to try to disrupt the French preparations. De N\u00e8grier's victory at N\u00fai Bop, won at odds of just under one to ten, was regarded by his fellow-officers as the most spectacular professional triumph of his career.<ref>Armengaud, 2\u20134; Bonifacy, 8\u20139; Dreyfus, 81\u20136; Harmant, 113\u201337; Lecomte, ''Lang-Son'', 155\u201376; ''Vie militaire'', 79\u201386; Maury, 129\u201332; Nicolas, 362\u20137; Sarrat, 169\u201370</ref>\n\nLogistical arrangements for the L\u1ea1ng S\u01a1n campaign were formidable.  It would take the column around ten days to advance to the outskirts of L\u1ea1ng S\u01a1n.  The troops would be burdened with the weight of their provisions and equipment, and would have to march through extremely difficult country.  The nights, in Tonkin in February, would be bitterly cold.  Supplying the column with food and ammunition would tax the ingenuity of the marine infantry officers responsible for the mule trains and the coolies.  It took the French a month to complete their preparations for the campaign, but by the end of January 1885, Bri\u00e8re de l'Isle had assembled an expeditionary column of just under 7,200 troops, accompanied by 4,500 coolies, at Chu.<ref>Lecomte, ''Lang-Son'', 177\u2013206; Sarrat, 171\u20137</ref>\n\n== French high command, L\u1ea1ng S\u01a1n campaign ==\n<gallery>\nImage:Louis Briere de lIsle.jpg|General Louis Bri\u00e8re de l'Isle (1827\u201396)\nImage:Fran\u00e7ois Oscar de N\u00e9grier.jpg|General Fran\u00e7ois de N\u00e9grier (1842\u20131913)\nFile:Ange-Laurent Giovanninelli.jpg|Colonel Ange-Laurent Giovanninelli (1839\u20131903)\n</gallery>\n\n== French order of battle ==\nThe L\u1ea1ng S\u01a1n expeditionary column (''colonne exp\u00e9ditionnaire de Lang-Son'') was organised around the two brigades originally established by General Millot in January 1885.

The battle was fought almost wholly by de N\u00e9grier's 2nd Brigade, which was leading the march, and demonstrated the unfitness for field command of Lieutenant-Colonel Paul-Gustave Herbinger, the French commander who would in late March 1885 give the controversial order for the [[Retreat from L\u1ea1ng S\u01a1n]].  Ordered to capture the 'Great Fort', the key to the Chinese position, with his three French line battalions, Herbinger made an elaborate flank march which exhausted his troops and wasted valuable time.  At length, seeing his operational timetable threatened, de N\u00e9grier ordered Schoeffer's 3rd Legion Battalion to take the fort instead.  The legionnaires scrambled rapidly up the mountain paths towards the Chinese position and captured it under Herbinger's nose.  Meanwhile, on the other side of the battlefield, Captain Gravereau's company of Diguet's 2nd Legion Battalion was isolated and surrounded by the Chinese.  The company was eventually disengaged by its comrades, but suffered heavy losses.  Although the battle was indisputably a French victory, French casualties were disconcertingly heavy: 18 dead and 101 wounded, most of them in Diguet and Schoeffer's Legion battalions.  These were the heaviest casualties the French had suffered in a single engagement since the start of the Sino-French War.<ref>Armengaud, 8\u201312; Bonifacy, 13\u201314; Harmant, 141\u20139; Lecomte, ''Lang-Son'', 230\u201340; ''Vie militaire'', 112\u201319; Maury, 134\u20137; Nicolas, 369\u201371</ref>\n\n===Actions at Ha Hoa and Dong Song, 5 and 6 February===\n\nOn 5 February the French assaulted the main complex of forts defending the Chinese entrenched camp at Dong Song, around Ha Hoa.  The two French brigades attacked side by side.  The 1st Brigade, on the left, overran a number of Chinese forts before their defenders could escape, and wiped out the garrisons by blowing in the roofs with dynamite.  The 2nd Brigade, on the right, captured the principal Chinese work of Pins Parasols, so named because it had been built around a conspicuous clump of umbrella pines.  The speed of the French attacks, prepared by artillery, kept the Chinese off balance throughout the battle, and French casualties were relatively low: 4 dead and 18 wounded.<ref>Armengaud, 12\u201314; Bonifacy, 14\u201315; Harmant, 149\u201350; Lecomte, ''Lang-Son'', 241\u201350; ''Vie militaire'', 120\u20134; Maury, 137\u20138; Nicolas, 371</ref>\n\nOn 6 February the French fought a morning action to clear the Chinese from their last defences before Dong Song, and took possession of the entrenched camp of Dong Song in the afternoon.  French casualties in this action were 3 dead and 41 wounded.  Bri\u00e8re de l'Isle had been hoping to push the Chinese back across the mountain of Deo Quao into the Song Thuong valley, away from L\u1ea1ng S\u01a1n, but most of the Chinese troops fell back up the Dong Song valley to Pho Bu, where they could make a further stand for L\u1ea1ng S\u01a1n.<ref>Armengaud, 15\u201316; Bonifacy, 15; Harmant, 150; Lecomte, ''Lang-Son'', 250\u20138; ''Vie militaire'', 124\u20135; Maury, 138\u201342; Nicolas, 372\u20133</ref>\n\n===Action at Deo Quao, 9 February===\n\nThe capture of Dong Song threatened the supply line of the Guangxi Army's right wing at B\u1eafc L\u1ec7, and the Chinese hastily pulled back from B\u1eafc L\u1ec7 and retreated up the Mandarin Road to Thanh Moy.  To cover their retreat they attacked the French outposts on the mountain of Deo Quao on 9 February.  The French units on Deo Quao easily repelled this attack, but the diversion allowed the Guangxi Army to regroup and make a final stand in front of L\u1ea1ng S\u01a1n.<ref>Armengaud, 16\u201319; Bonifacy, 16; Harmant, 150\u20131; Lecomte, ''Lang-Son'', 273\u20136; Maury, 142\u20134</ref>\n\n===Action at Pho Vy, 11 February===\n\nAfter a pause for breath at Dong Song to resupply with food and ammunition and to establish a shorter supply line back to Chu across the mountain of Deo Quan, the Tonkin expeditionary corps pressed on towards L\u1ea1ng S\u01a1n.  On 11 February the 2nd Brigade, at the head of the French column, contacted advance elements of the Guangxi Army at Pho Vy.  The Chinese were ejected from the village of Pho Vy by Herbinger's three French battalions with little difficulty, but they brought up their reserves and mounted a counterattack against Herbinger's regiment which forced de Negrier to commit Diguet's Legion battalion to drive them off.  Towards the end of the battle the 111th Battalion stormed a Chinese hill position under the eyes of the rest of the brigade.  2nd Lieutenant Rene Normand, who fell a month later in the [[Battle of Bang Bo]] and whose letters from Tonkin were published after his death, distinguished himself in this action.  Towards evening the Chinese fell back on their main body at Bac Vie.  French casualties at Pho Vy were slight: a total of 1 dead and 23 wounded.<ref>Armengaud, 20\u20131; Harmant, 151\u20137; Lecomte, ''Lang-Son'', 277\u201388; Maury, 144\u201350; Nicolas, 373\u20134; Normand, 106\u201315, 151\u20132, 166\u20137 and 190\u20133</ref>\n\n===Battle of Bac Vie, 12 February===\n\n[[Image:Map of Bac Vie.jpg|thumb|left|160px|Map of the battle of Bac Vie, 12 February 1885]]\n[[Image:Battle of Bac Vie.jpg|thumb|right|200px|French troops advance on Chinese hill positions during the battle of Bac Vie]]\nThe culminating battle for L\u1ea1ng S\u01a1n was fought on 12 February at Bac Vie, several kilometres to the south of L\u1ea1ng S\u01a1n.  Giovanninelli's 1st Brigade was leading the French column, and de N\u00e9grier's 2nd Brigade took little part in the battle.  In a costly but successful assault, Giovanninelli's Turcos and marine infantry stormed the Chinese defences.  The battle was fought in thick fog, allowing the Chinese to mount a dangerous counterattack at one point that nearly swept away part of Giovanninelli's brigade.  Eventually the French broke through the Chinese centre, and the isolated Chinese wings retreated in disorder back to L\u1ea1ng S\u01a1n.  French casualties at Bac Vie were 30 dead and 188 wounded, the highest casualties of the campaign.  Most of these casualties were sustained by the two Turco battalions in Giovanninelli's brigade, which had borne the brunt of the battle.  ''Chef d'escadron'' Levrard, the 1st Brigade's artillery commander, was shot dead during the battle, and Bri\u00e8re de l'Isle's ''officier d'ordonnance'' 2nd Lieutenant Bossant, the son of a senior French general, was killed at Bri\u00e8re de l'Isle's side.<ref>Armengaud, 21\u20134; Harmant, 157\u20138; Lecomte, ''Lang-Son'', 288\u201398 and 304\u20135; Maury, 150\u20133; Nicolas, 374\u20138</ref>\n\n===Capture of L\u1ea1ng S\u01a1n and action at Ky Lua, 13 February===\n\nOn 13 February the French column entered L\u1ea1ng S\u01a1n, which the Chinese abandoned after fighting a token rearguard action at the nearby village of Ky Lua.  In compliment to their performance at Bac Vie, Bri\u00e8re de l'Isle gave Giovanninelli's Turcos and marine infantry the honour of leading the French entry into L\u1ea1ng S\u01a1n.  The Guangxi Army fell back towards the Chinese border and occupied a strong defensive position at Dong Dang, a small town just in Tonkinese territory.<ref>Armengaud, 24\u20138; Bonifacy, 17\u201318; Lecomte, ''Lang-Son'', 298\u2013305; ''Vie militaire'', 145\u201359, 161\u201377 and 179\u201386; Maury, 153\u20136; Nicolas, 378\u201380</ref>\n\n== Orders of the Day ==\nBri\u00e8re de l'Isle issued two orders of the day during the L\u1ea1ng S\u01a1n campaign.  The first, issued on 7 February, marked the capture of the Chinese entrenched camp of Dong Song:\n<blockquote>\nLes formidables camps retranch\u00e9s de Ha-Hoa et de Dong-Song sont entre vos mains avec d'immenses approvisionnements d'armes, de munitions et de vivres que votre \u00e9lan n\u2019a pas permis \u00e0 l'ennemi d'emporter.  Pendant les combats des 4, 5 et 6 f\u00e9vrier, qui vous ont rendus ma\u00eetres de ces admirables positions sur lesquelles l'arm\u00e9e chinoise avait compt\u00e9 pour nous barrer les d\u00e9bouch\u00e9s du Deo-Van et du Deo-Quan et nous interdire les routes du Than-Mo\u00ef et de Lang-Son, vous avez \u00e9gal\u00e9 les troupes les plus cit\u00e9es dans les annales de l'arm\u00e9e fran\u00e7aise.  Vous avez ajout\u00e9 une belle page \u00e0 notre histoire nationale.  Honneur \u00e0 vos chefs et \u00e0 vous!  Vous approchez du terme de votre mission.

Glory to all of you who successfully measured yourselves with this army in the actions of the 4th at Tay Hoa, the 5th at Ha Hoa, the 6th at Dong Song, the 9th at Deo Quao, the 11th at Pho Vy, the 12th at Bac Vie and the 13th at L\u1ea1ng S\u01a1n, and chased it, despite its vigorous resistance, from the formidable positions which it occupied!

Before his departure he ordered General de N\u00e9grier, who would remain at L\u1ea1ng S\u01a1n with the 2nd Brigade, to press on towards the Chinese border and expel the battered remnants of the Guangxi Army from Tonkinese soil. After resupplying the 2nd Brigade with food and ammunition, De N\u00e9grier advanced to attack the Guangxi Army at Dong Dang.  On 23 February de N\u00e9grier stormed the Chinese defences at Dong Dang, forcing the Chinese to retreat towards the Chinese border town of Longzhou (Lung-chou, \u9f8d\u5dde).<ref>Armengaud, 28\u201335; Bonifacy, 20\u20131; Dreyfus, 117\u201320; Grisot and Coulombon, 459\u201360; Harmant, 175\u201380; Lecomte, ''Lang-Son'', 337\u201349; Maury, 159\u201372; Nicolas, 380\u201383; Normand, 122\u201334, 135\u201341 and 169\u201374</ref>\n\nAfter clearing the Chinese from Tonkinese territory the French crossed briefly into Guangxi province and on 25 February blew up the 'Gate of China', an elaborate Chinese customs building on the border at [[Friendship Gate|Zhennan Pass]] (Zhennanguan). They were not strong enough to exploit this victory, however, and de N\u00e9grier returned to L\u1ea1ng S\u01a1n with the bulk of the 2nd Brigade at the end of February.  A small French garrison under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Herbinger was left at Dong Dang to watch the movements of the Guangxi Army.  Three weeks later the Chinese attacked the Dong Dang garrison, precipitating a series of events that led to a decisive French defeat at the [[Battle of Bang Bo]] (24 March 1885).\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=Note}}\n\n== Footnotes ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n* Armengaud, J.
