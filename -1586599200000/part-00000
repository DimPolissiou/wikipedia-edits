In these works, Assamese features coexist with features from other Modern Indian Languages.\n\nA fully distinguished literary form (poetry) appeared first in the fourteenth century\u2014 in the courts of the [[Kamata kingdom]] and in the courts of an eastern Kachari king where [[Madhav Kandali]] translated the Ramayana into Assamese ([[Saptakanda Ramayana]]). From the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, songs \u2013 ''[[Borgeet]]s'', dramas \u2013 ''[[Ankia Naat|Ankiya Naat]]'' and the first prose writings (by [[Bhattadeva]]) were composed. The literary language moved to the court of the [[Ahom kingdom]] in the seventeenth century,{{Sfn|Guha|1983|p=9}} where it became the state language. This period saw the widespread development of standardised prose infused with colloquial forms in [[Buranji]]s.\n\nAccording to {{Harvcoltxt|Goswami|2003}}, this included \"the colloquial prose of religious biographies, the archaic prose of magical charms, the conventional prose of utilitarian literature on medicine, astrology, arithmetic, dance and music, and above all the standardised prose of the [[Buranji]]s.{{Sfn|Goswami|2003|p=434}} The literary language, having become infused with the eastern idiom, became the standard literary form in the nineteenth century, when the British adopted it for state purposes. As the political and commercial center shifted to Guwahati after the mid-twentieth century, the literary form moved away from the eastern variety to take its current form.\n\n== Geographical distribution ==\nAssamese is native to [[Brahmaputra Valley]] consisting of [[Western Assam|western]] and eastern Assam.

Each letter represents a single sound with an inherent vowel, the short vowel {{IPAslink|\u0254}}.\n\nThe first twenty-five consonants letters are called ''sparxa barna'' {{IPA-as|sparxa barna|}}. These ''sparxa barna''s are again divided into five ''barga''s. Therefore, these twenty-five letters are also called \"bargia barna\".{{Clarify|date=May 2017}}{{Verify source|date=May 2017}}\n\n===Alveolar stops===\nThe Assamese phoneme inventory is unique in the Indic group of languages in its lack of a dental-retroflex distinction among the [[Coronal consonant|coronal]] stops as well as the lack of postalveolar affricates and fricatives.<ref>\"Assamese, alone among NIA languages except for Romany, has also lost the characteristic IA dental/retroflex contrast (although it is retained in spelling), reducing the number of articulations, with the loss also of {{IPA|/c/}}, to three.\" {{harv|Masica|1993|p=95}}</ref> Historically, the [[Dental consonant|dental]] and [[retroflex consonant|retroflex]] series merged into [[Alveolar plosive|alveolar stops]]. This makes Assamese resemble non-Indic languages of Northeast India (such as [[Austroasiatic languages|Austroasiatic]] and [[Sino-Tibetan languages]]).{{Sfn|Moral|1997|p=45}} The only other language to have fronted retroflex stops into alveolars is the closely related eastern dialects of Bengali (although a contrast with dental stops remains in those dialects).

The change of {{IPA|/s/}} to {{IPA|/h/}} and then to {{IPA|/x/}} has been attributed to Tibeto-Burman influence by [[Suniti Kumar Chatterji|Dr. Chatterjee]].<ref>Chatterjee, Suniti Kumar, ''Kirata Jana Krti'', p. 54.</ref>\n\n===Velar nasal===\nAssamese, Odia, and Bengali, in contrast to other Indo-Aryan languages, use the [[velar nasal]] (the [[English language|English]] ''ng'' in ''sing'') extensively. In many languages, while the velar nasal is commonly restricted to preceding velar sounds, in Assamese it can occur intervocalically.<ref name=\"iitg\"/>  This is another feature it shares with other languages of Northeast India, though in Assamese the velar nasal never occurs word-initially.{{Sfn|Moral|1997|p=46}}\n\n===Vowel inventory===\nEastern Indic languages like Assamese, Bengali, Sylheti, and Odia do not have a vowel length distinction, but have a wide set of [[Roundedness|back rounded vowels]]. In the case of Assamese, there are four back rounded vowels that contrast phonemically, as demonstrated by the minimal set: {{Lang|as|\u0995\u09b2\u09be}} ''k\u00f4la'' {{IPA|[k\u0254la]}} ('deaf'), {{Lang|as|\u0995'\u09b2\u09be}} ''kola'' {{IPA|[kola]}} ('black'), {{Lang|as|\u0995\u09cb\u09b2\u09be}} ''k\u00fbla'' {{IPA|[k\u028ala]}} ('lap'), and {{Lang|as|\u0995\u09c1\u09b2\u09be}} ''kula'' {{IPA|[kula]}} ('winnowing fan').  The [[near-close near-back rounded vowel]] {{IPA|/\u028a/}} is unique in this branch of the language family. But in lower Assam, \u0993 is pronounced same as \u0985' (o') which is also correct. {{Lang|as|\u0995\u09cb\u09b2\u09be}} ''kola'' {{IPA|[ko'la]}} {{Lang|as|\u09ae\u09cb\u09f0}} ''mor'' {{IPA|[mo'r]}}\n\n'''<big>Vowel harmony</big>'''\n\nAssamese has [[vowel harmony]]. The vowels [i] and [u] cause the preceding mid vowels and the high back vowels to change to [e] and [o] and [u] respectively. Assamese is one of the few languages spoken in India which exhibit a systematic process of vowel harmony <ref>{{Cite thesis|url=https://www.lotpublications.nl/directionality-and-locality-in-vowel-harmony-directionality-and-locality-in-vowel-harmony-with-special-reference-to-vowel-harmony-in-assamese|title=Directionality and locality in vowel harmony: With special reference to vowel harmony in Assamese|via=www.lotpublications.nl}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mahanta|first=Shakuntala|date=August 2012|title=Assamese|journal=Journal of the International Phonetic Association|language=en|volume=42|issue=2|pages=217\u2013224|doi=10.1017/S0025100312000096|issn=1475-3502}}</ref>\n\n==Writing system==\nModern Assamese uses the [[Assamese alphabet|Assamese script]], and in the medieval times, the script came in three varieties: ''Bamuniya'', ''Garhgaya,'' ''Kaitheli/Lakhari'', which developed from the [[Kamarupi script]]. It very closely resembles the [[Mithilakshar]] script of the [[Maithili language]], as well as the [[Bengali alphabet|Bengali script]].<ref>{{harvnb|Bara|1981|p=?}}{{full citation needed|date=November 2019}}</ref> There is a strong literary tradition from early times.  Examples can be seen in edicts, land grants and copper plates of medieval kings.  Assam had its own manuscript writing system on the bark of the ''[[Aquilaria malaccensis|saanchi]]'' tree in which religious texts and chronicles were written, as opposed to the pan-Indian system of [[Palm leaf manuscript]] writing.  The present-day spellings in Assamese are not necessarily phonetic. ''[[Hemkosh]]'' ({{lang|as|\u09b9\u09c7\u09ae\u0995\u09cb\u09b7}} {{IPA|[\u0266\u025bmk\u028ax]}}), the second Assamese dictionary, introduced spellings based on [[Sanskrit]], which are now the standard.\n\nIn the early 1970s, it was agreed upon that the Roman script was to be the standard writing system for [[Nagamese Creole]].<ref name=\":1\" />\n==Morphology and grammar==\nThe Assamese language has the following characteristic morphological features:{{Sfn|Kommaluri|Subramanian|Sagar K|2005}}\n* Gender and number are not grammatically marked.\n* There is a lexical distinction of gender in the third person pronoun.\n* Transitive verbs are distinguished from intransitive.\n* The agentive case is overtly marked as distinct from the accusative.\n* Kinship nouns are inflected for personal pronominal possession.\n* Adverbs can be derived from the verb roots.\n* A passive construction may be employed idiomatically.\n\n===Negation process===\nVerbs in Assamese are negated by adding {{IPA|/n/}} before the verb, with {{IPA|/n/}} picking up the initial vowel of the verb. For example:{{Sfn|Moral|1997|p=47}}\n* {{IPA|/na la\u0261\u025b/}} 'do(es) not want' (1st, 2nd and 3rd persons)\n* {{IPA|/ni lik\u02b0\u028a\u0303/}} 'will not write' (1st person)\n* {{IPA|/nukut\u028a\u0303/}} 'will not nibble' (1st person)\n* {{IPA|/n\u025bl\u025bk\u02b0\u025b/}} 'does not count' (3rd person)\n* {{IPA|/n\u0254k\u0254\u0279\u0254/}} 'do not do' (2nd person)\n\n===Classifiers===\nAssamese has a large collection of [[classifier (linguistics)|classifiers]], which are used extensively for different kinds of objects, acquired from the [[Sino-Tibetan languages]].{{Sfn|Moral|1997|pp=49-51}} A few examples of the most extensive and elaborate use of classifiers are given below:\n*\"'''''z\u0254n'''''\" is used to signify a person, male with some amount of respect\n**E.g., manuh-''z\u0254n'' \u2013 \"the man\"\n*\"'''''z\u0254ni'''''\" (female) is used after a noun or pronoun to indicate human beings\n**E.g., manuh-''z\u0254ni'' \u2013 \"the woman\"\n*\"'''''z\u0254ni'''''\" is also used to express the non-human feminine\n**E.g., s\u0254\u0279ai ''z\u0254ni'' \u2013  \"the bird\", p\u0254\u0279uwa-''z\u0254ni'' \u2013 \"the ant\"\n*\"'''''z\u0254na'''''\" and \"'''''g\u0254\u0279aki'''''\" are used to express high respect for both man and woman\n**E.g., k\u0254bi-''z\u0254na'' \u2013  \"the poet\", g\u028axa\u026a-''z\u0254na'' \u2013  \"the goddess\", rastrapati-''g\u0254\u0279aki'' \u2013 \"the president\", ti\u0279\u028ata-''g\u0254\u0279aki'' \u2013 \"the woman\"\n*\"'''''t\u028a'''''\" has three forms: '''''t\u028a''''', '''''ta''''', '''''ti'''''\n**(a) t\u028a: is used to specify something, although someone, e.g., lo\u0279a-''t\u028a'' \u2013 \"the particular boy\" (impolite)\n**(b) ta: is used only after numerals, e.g., \u025b''ta'', du''ta'', tini''ta'' \u2013 \"one, two, three\"\n**(c) ti: is the diminutive form, e.g., kesua-''ti'' \u2013  \"the infant, besides expressing more affection or attachment to\n*\"'''''k\u0254sa'''''\", \"'''''m\u0254t\u02b0a'''''\" and \"'''''ta\u0279'''''\" are used for things in bunches\n**E.g., sabi-''k\u0254sa'' - \"the bunch of key\", saul-''m\u0254t\u02b0a'' \u2013 \"a handful of rice\", suli-''ta\u0279i'' or suli ''k\u0254sa'' \u2013 \"the bunch of hair\"\n*'''''dal''''', '''''dali''''', are used after nouns to indicate something long but round and solid\n**E.g., b\u00e3\u02b1-''dal'' - \"the bamboo\", kat\u02b0-''dal'' \u2013 \"the piece of wood\", b\u00e3\u02b1-''dali'' \u2013 \"the piece of bamboo\"\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Assamese Classifiers\n!

Example: Moi porh\u00fc, Moi noporh\u00fc (I read, I do not read); Tumi khelila, Tumi nekhelila (You played, You didn't play). For verbs that start with a vowel, just the ''n-'' is added, without vowel lengthening. In some dialects if the 1st vowel is ''a'' in a verb that starts with consonant, ''ne'' is used, like, ''Moi nakha\u00fc'' (I don't eat) is ''Moi nekha\u00fc''. In past continuous the negative form is ''-i thoka nasil-''. In future continuous it's ''-i na(/e)thaki-''. In present continuous and present perfect, just ''-i thoka nai'' and ''-a nai''' respectively are used for all personal pronouns. Sometimes for plural pronouns, the ''-hok'' suffix is used, like ''kor\u00fchok'' (we do), ''ahilahok'' (you guys came).Content|size=small}}\n\n===Relationship suffixes===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" align=\"center\" style=\"font-size:80%;\n|-\n!

About the time his money ran out, a great famine swept over the land, and he began to starve. He persuaded a local farmer to hire him, and the man sent him into his fields to feed the pigs. The young man became so hungry that even the pods he was feeding the pigs looked good to him.

In these works, Assamese features coexist with features from other Modern Indian Languages.\n\nA fully distinguished literary form (poetry) appeared first in the fourteenth century\u2014 in the courts of the [[Kamata kingdom]] and in the courts of an eastern Kachari king where [[Madhav Kandali]] translated the Ramayana into Assamese ([[Saptakanda Ramayana]]). From the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, songs \u2013 ''[[Borgeet]]s'', dramas \u2013 ''[[Ankia Naat|Ankiya Naat]]'' and the first prose writings (by [[Bhattadeva]]) were composed. The literary language moved to the court of the [[Ahom kingdom]] in the seventeenth century,{{Sfn|Guha|1983|p=9}} where it became the state language. This period saw the widespread development of standardised prose infused with colloquial forms in [[Buranji]]s.\n\nAccording to {{Harvcoltxt|Goswami|2003}}, this included \"the colloquial prose of religious biographies, the archaic prose of magical charms, the conventional prose of utilitarian literature on medicine, astrology, arithmetic, dance and music, and above all the standardised prose of the [[Buranji]]s.{{Sfn|Goswami|2003|p=434}} The literary language, having become infused with the eastern idiom, became the standard literary form in the nineteenth century, when the British adopted it for state purposes. As the political and commercial center shifted to Guwahati after the mid-twentieth century, the literary form moved away from the eastern variety to take its current form.\n\n== Geographical distribution ==\nAssamese is native to [[Brahmaputra Valley]] consisting of [[Western Assam|western]] and eastern Assam.

clusters ===\n{{Main article|Assamese consonant clusters}}\nConsonant clusters in Assamese include thirty-three pure consonant letters in the [[Assamese alphabet]]. Each letter represents a single sound with an inherent vowel, the short vowel {{IPAslink|\u0254}}.\n\nThe first twenty-five consonants letters are called ''sparxa barna'' {{IPA-as|sparxa barna|}}. These ''sparxa barna''s are again divided into five ''barga''s. Therefore, these twenty-five letters are also called \"bargia barna\".{{Clarify|date=May 2017}}{{Verify source|date=May 2017}}\n\n===Alveolar stops===\nThe Assamese phoneme inventory is unique in the Indic group of languages in its lack of a dental-retroflex distinction among the [[Coronal consonant|coronal]] stops as well as the lack of postalveolar affricates and fricatives.<ref>\"Assamese, alone among NIA languages except for Romany, has also lost the characteristic IA dental/retroflex contrast (although it is retained in spelling), reducing the number of articulations, with the loss also of {{IPA|/c/}}, to three.\" {{harv|Masica|1993|p=95}}</ref> Historically, the [[Dental consonant|dental]] and [[retroflex consonant|retroflex]] series merged into [[Alveolar plosive|alveolar stops]]. This makes Assamese resemble non-Indic languages of Northeast India (such as [[Austroasiatic languages|Austroasiatic]] and [[Sino-Tibetan languages]]).{{Sfn|Moral|1997|p=45}} The only other language to have fronted retroflex stops into alveolars is the closely related eastern dialects of Bengali (although a contrast with dental stops remains in those dialects). Note that {{IPAslink|r}} is normally realised as {{IPAblink|\u0279}} or as a [[retroflex approximant]].\n\n===Voiceless velar fricative===\nAssamese and [[Sylheti language|Sylheti]] are unusual among Eastern Indo-Aryan languages for the presence of the {{IPA|/x/}} (which, phonetically, varies between velar ({{IPAblink|x}}) and a uvular ({{IPAblink|\u03c7}}) pronunciations, depending on the speaker and speech register), historically the MIA sibilant has [[lenition|lenited]] to {{IPA|/x/}} and {{IPA|/h/}} (non-initially).<ref>The word \"hare\", for example: ''\u015ba\u015bka'' (OIA) > ''\u03c7\u0254h\u0101'' (hare).  {{harv|Masica|1993|p=206}}</ref> The derivation of the velar fricative from the coronal sibilant {{IPA|/s/}} is evident in the name of the language in Assamese; some Assamese prefer to write {{angle bracket|Oxomiya}} or {{angle bracket|\u00d4x\u00f4miya}} instead of {{angle bracket|Asomiya}} or {{angle bracket|Asamiya}} to reflect the sound change.<ref>Whereas most fricatives become sibilants in Eastern Goalpariya (''sukh'', ''santi'', ''asa'' in Eastern Goalpariya; ''xukh'', ''xanti'', ''axa'' in western Kamrupi) {{harv|Dutta|1995|p=286}}; some use of the fricative is seen as in the word ''xi'' (for both \"he\" and \"she\") {{harv|Dutta|1995|p=287}} and ''xap khar'' (the snake) {{harv|Dutta|1995|p=288}}. The {{IPAslink|x}} is completely absent in Western Goalpariya {{harv|Dutta|1995|p=290}}</ref> The voiceless velar fricative is absent in the West Goalpariya dialects<ref>B Datta (1982), ''Linguistic situation in north-east India'', the distinctive h sound of Assamese is absent in the West Goalpariya dialect</ref> though it is found in lesser extent in East Goalpariya and Kamrupi,<ref>Goswami, Upendranath (1970), ''A Study on Kamrupi'', p.xiii {{IPA|/x/}} does not occur finally in Kamrupi. But in St. Coll. it occurs. In non-initial positions O.I.A sibilants became {{IPA|/k\u02b0/}} and also {{IPA|/h/}} whereas in St. Coll. they become {{IPA|/x/}}.</ref> otherwise used extensively further east. The change of {{IPA|/s/}} to {{IPA|/h/}} and then to {{IPA|/x/}} has been attributed to Tibeto-Burman influence by [[Suniti Kumar Chatterji|Dr. Chatterjee]].<ref>Chatterjee, Suniti Kumar, ''Kirata Jana Krti'', p. 54.</ref>\n\n===Velar nasal===\nAssamese, Odia, and Bengali, in contrast to other Indo-Aryan languages, use the [[velar nasal]] (the [[English language|English]] ''ng'' in ''sing'') extensively. In many languages, while the velar nasal is commonly restricted to preceding velar sounds, in Assamese it can occur intervocalically.<ref name=\"iitg\"/>  This is another feature it shares with other languages of Northeast India, though in Assamese the velar nasal never occurs word-initially.{{Sfn|Moral|1997|p=46}}\n\n===Vowel inventory===\nEastern Indic languages like Assamese, Bengali, Sylheti, and Odia do not have a vowel length distinction, but have a wide set of [[Roundedness|back rounded vowels]]. In the case of Assamese, there are four back rounded vowels that contrast phonemically, as demonstrated by the minimal set: {{Lang|as|\u0995\u09b2\u09be}} ''k\u00f4la'' {{IPA|[k\u0254la]}} ('deaf'), {{Lang|as|\u0995'\u09b2\u09be}} ''kola'' {{IPA|[kola]}} ('black'), {{Lang|as|\u0995\u09cb\u09b2\u09be}} ''k\u00fbla'' {{IPA|[k\u028ala]}} ('lap'), and {{Lang|as|\u0995\u09c1\u09b2\u09be}} ''kula'' {{IPA|[kula]}} ('winnowing fan').  The [[near-close near-back rounded vowel]] {{IPA|/\u028a/}} is unique in this branch of the language family. But in lower Assam, \u0993 is pronounced same as \u0985' (o') which is also correct. {{Lang|as|\u0995\u09cb\u09b2\u09be}} ''kola'' {{IPA|[ko'la]}} {{Lang|as|\u09ae\u09cb\u09f0}} ''mor'' {{IPA|[mo'r]}}\n\n'''<big>Vowel harmony</big>'''\n\nAssamese has [[vowel harmony]]. The vowels [i] and [u] cause the preceding mid vowels and the high back vowels to change to [e] and [o] and [u] respectively. Assamese is one of the few languages spoken in India which exhibit a systematic process of vowel harmony <ref>{{Cite thesis|url=https://www.lotpublications.nl/directionality-and-locality-in-vowel-harmony-directionality-and-locality-in-vowel-harmony-with-special-reference-to-vowel-harmony-in-assamese|title=Directionality and locality in vowel harmony: With special reference to vowel harmony in Assamese|via=www.lotpublications.nl}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mahanta|first=Shakuntala|date=August 2012|title=Assamese|journal=Journal of the International Phonetic Association|language=en|volume=42|issue=2|pages=217\u2013224|doi=10.1017/S0025100312000096|issn=1475-3502}}</ref>\n\n==Writing system==\nModern Assamese uses the [[Assamese alphabet|Assamese script]], and in the medieval times, the script came in three varieties: ''Bamuniya'', ''Garhgaya,'' ''Kaitheli/Lakhari'', which developed from the [[Kamarupi script]]. It very closely resembles the [[Mithilakshar]] script of the [[Maithili language]], as well as the [[Bengali alphabet|Bengali script]].<ref>{{harvnb|Bara|1981|p=?}}{{full citation needed|date=November 2019}}</ref> There is a strong literary tradition from early times.  Examples can be seen in edicts, land grants and copper plates of medieval kings.  Assam had its own manuscript writing system on the bark of the ''[[Aquilaria malaccensis|saanchi]]'' tree in which religious texts and chronicles were written, as opposed to the pan-Indian system of [[Palm leaf manuscript]] writing.  The present-day spellings in Assamese are not necessarily phonetic. ''[[Hemkosh]]'' ({{lang|as|\u09b9\u09c7\u09ae\u0995\u09cb\u09b7}} {{IPA|[\u0266\u025bmk\u028ax]}}), the second Assamese dictionary, introduced spellings based on [[Sanskrit]], which are now the standard.\n\nIn the early 1970s, it was agreed upon that the Roman script was to be the standard writing system for [[Nagamese Creole]].<ref name=\":1\" />\n==Morphology and grammar==\nThe Assamese language has the following characteristic morphological features:{{Sfn|Kommaluri|Subramanian|Sagar K|2005}}\n* Gender and number are not grammatically marked.\n* There is a lexical distinction of gender in the third person pronoun.\n* Transitive verbs are distinguished from intransitive.\n* The agentive case is overtly marked as distinct from the accusative.\n* Kinship nouns are inflected for personal pronominal possession.\n* Adverbs can be derived from the verb roots.\n* A passive construction may be employed idiomatically.\n\n===Negation process===\nVerbs in Assamese are negated by adding {{IPA|/n/}} before the verb, with {{IPA|/n/}} picking up the initial vowel of the verb. For example:{{Sfn|Moral|1997|p=47}}\n* {{IPA|/na la\u0261\u025b/}} 'do(es) not want' (1st, 2nd and 3rd persons)\n* {{IPA|/ni lik\u02b0\u028a\u0303/}} 'will not write' (1st person)\n* {{IPA|/nukut\u028a\u0303/}} 'will not nibble' (1st person)\n* {{IPA|/n\u025bl\u025bk\u02b0\u025b/}} 'does not count' (3rd person)\n* {{IPA|/n\u0254k\u0254\u0279\u0254/}} 'do not do' (2nd person)\n\n===Classifiers===\nAssamese has a large collection of [[classifier (linguistics)|classifiers]], which are used extensively for different kinds of objects, acquired from the [[Sino-Tibetan languages]].{{Sfn|Moral|1997|pp=49-51}} A few examples of the most extensive and elaborate use of classifiers are given below:\n*\"'''''z\u0254n'''''\" is used to signify a person, male with some amount of respect\n**E.g., manuh-''z\u0254n'' \u2013 \"the man\"\n*\"'''''z\u0254ni'''''\" (female) is used after a noun or pronoun to indicate human beings\n**E.g., manuh-''z\u0254ni'' \u2013 \"the woman\"\n*\"'''''z\u0254ni'''''\" is also used to express the non-human feminine\n**E.g., s\u0254\u0279ai ''z\u0254ni'' \u2013  \"the bird\", p\u0254\u0279uwa-''z\u0254ni'' \u2013 \"the ant\"\n*\"'''''z\u0254na'''''\" and \"'''''g\u0254\u0279aki'''''\" are used to express high respect for both man and woman\n**E.g., k\u0254bi-''z\u0254na'' \u2013  \"the poet\", g\u028axa\u026a-''z\u0254na'' \u2013  \"the goddess\", rastrapati-''g\u0254\u0279aki'' \u2013 \"the president\", ti\u0279\u028ata-''g\u0254\u0279aki'' \u2013 \"the woman\"\n*\"'''''t\u028a'''''\" has three forms: '''''t\u028a''''', '''''ta''''', '''''ti'''''\n**(a) t\u028a: is used to specify something, although someone, e.g., lo\u0279a-''t\u028a'' \u2013 \"the particular boy\" (impolite)\n**(b) ta: is used only after numerals, e.g., \u025b''ta'', du''ta'', tini''ta'' \u2013 \"one, two, three\"\n**(c) ti: is the diminutive form, e.g., kesua-''ti'' \u2013  \"the infant, besides expressing more affection or attachment to\n*\"'''''k\u0254sa'''''\", \"'''''m\u0254t\u02b0a'''''\" and \"'''''ta\u0279'''''\" are used for things in bunches\n**E.g., sabi-''k\u0254sa'' - \"the bunch of key\", saul-''m\u0254t\u02b0a'' \u2013 \"a handful of rice\", suli-''ta\u0279i'' or suli ''k\u0254sa'' \u2013 \"the bunch of hair\"\n*'''''dal''''', '''''dali''''', are used after nouns to indicate something long but round and solid\n**E.g., b\u00e3\u02b1-''dal'' - \"the bamboo\", kat\u02b0-''dal'' \u2013 \"the piece of wood\", b\u00e3\u02b1-''dali'' \u2013 \"the piece of bamboo\"\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Assamese Classifiers\n!

Example: Moi porh\u00fc, Moi noporh\u00fc (I read, I do not read); Tumi khelila, Tumi nekhelila (You played, You didn't play). For verbs that start with a vowel, just the ''n-'' is added, without vowel lengthening. In some dialects if the 1st vowel is ''a'' in a verb that starts with consonant, ''ne'' is used, like, ''Moi nakha\u00fc'' (I don't eat) is ''Moi nekha\u00fc''. In past continuous the negative form is ''-i thoka nasil-''. In future continuous it's ''-i na(/e)thaki-''. In present continuous and present perfect, just ''-i thoka nai'' and ''-a nai''' respectively are used for all personal pronouns.

About the time his money ran out, a great famine swept over the land, and he began to starve. He persuaded a local farmer to hire him, and the man sent him into his fields to feed the pigs.

Originally a PhD thesis, the author adapted it into a book.<ref name=\"Financial-Times\">{{cite news |last1=Ben-Ami |first1=Daniel |title=Free market defined |url=https://www.ft.com/content/519636d2-4298-11e2-a3d2-00144feabdc0 |accessdate=30 July 2019 |publisher=Financial Times |date=13 December 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"Prospect\">{{cite news |last1=Burns |first1=Jennifer |title=The Measure of All Things |url=https://prospect.org/article/measure-all-things |accessdate=3 August 2019 |publisher=The American Prospect |date=3 December 2012}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Jones, neoliberalism began after the [[Great Depression]] as a movement of intellectuals committed to protecting [[liberalism|liberal]] values of [[individual liberty]] and [[limited government]], which they believed were threatened in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and the [[United States]] by expanding government. They aimed to construct a distinctly new liberalism (hence \"neoliberalism\") by charting a middle way between the [[laissez-faire]] economics of the pre-[[Great Depression|Depression]] era and the \"[[collectivism]]\" of [[New Deal]] liberalism and British [[social democracy]]. He argues that between the 1950s and 1970s this commitment evolved into one of greater conviction in the superiority of the [[free market]], such that by the 1980s neoliberal policy proposals centered almost entirely around [[market liberalization]]. Modern neoliberalism, according to Jones, is associated with [[economic liberalism]], [[monetarism]], and a staunch support of [[free market]] [[capitalism]], and advocates political policies of [[deregulation]], [[privatization]], and other market-based reforms.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|1}}\n\nJones structures the book around what he argues are the three phases of the history of neoliberalism. In the first, lasting from roughly 1920 until 1950, he details how early European neoliberal thinkers like [[Friedrich Hayek]], [[Ludwig von Mises]], and [[Karl Popper]], motivated by expanding government and later the rise of totalitarian regimes in Europe during [[World War II]], developed critiques of \"[[collectivism]]\", which to them included British [[social democracy]] and American [[New Deal]] liberalism. Particularly influential during this time was the formation of the [[Mont Pelerin Society]], which brought together intellectuals committed to the defense of [[liberalism]] and [[individualism]]. In the second phase, lasting from roughly 1950 until 1980, the locus of neoliberal thought moved to the [[United States]], where academics like [[Milton Friedman]] and [[George Stigler]] built upon the earlier neoliberal foundation by developing new academic and political arguments and introducing a range of neoliberal policy prescriptions. It was during this time that Jones contends neoliberal thought evolved from its more moderate early stance into a \"faith\" in the power and efficiency of markets. Jones argues that during this period a transatlantic network of intellectuals, businessmen, journalists, and [[think tanks]] arose to promote neoliberal ideology, slowly moving neoliberalism out of the political fringes and into the mainstream. The third phase, taking place after 1980, was the period of neoliberal political prominence. After a decade of [[stagflation]] in the United States and the United Kingdom, the neoliberal alternative to the [[Keynesian]] consensus that had dominated politics was adopted by politicians, finding particular influence with US president [[Ronald Reagan]] and British prime minister [[Margaret Thatcher]]. This era, Jones notes, was characterized by sweeping [[deregulation]], [[market liberalization]], and [[tax cut|tax reductions]].\n\n==Structure==\nThe book is divided into an introduction, seven chapters, and a conclusion.<ref name =\"Masters\">{{cite book|url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/9827.html|title=Masters of the Universe: Hayek, Friedman, and the Birth of Neoliberal Politics|last=Stedman Jones|first=Daniel|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2012|isbn=978-0691151571|ref=harv}}</ref> \n* The introduction summarizes the history of [[neoliberalism]] and lays out the structure of the book. \n* Chapter one (\"The Postwar Settlement\") provides context for the rise of neoliberalism by briefly describing the development of [[embedded liberalism]] and [[Keynesianism]] after the [[Great Depression]]. \n* Chapter two (\"The 1940s: The Emergence of the Neoliberal Critique\") discusses the critiques of [[social democracy]] by the early neoliberals [[Karl Popper]], [[Ludwig von Mises]], and [[Friedrich Hayek]], and outlines the birth of the [[Mont Pelerin Society]].\n* Chapter three (\"The Rising Tide: Neoliberal Ideas in the Postwar Period) discusses the two [[Chicago school of economics|Chicago School]]s, the relation of [[Adam Smith]] to neoliberalism, the early ideas of [[Milton Friedman]], the [[ordoliberal]]s in [[West Germany]], and the economic theories of [[regulatory capture]], [[public choice]], and [[rational choice theory]]. \n* Chapter four (\"A Transatlantic Nework: Think Tanks and the Ideological Entrepreneurs\") discusses [[fusionism]] in the [[United States]], [[conservatism]] in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] during the 1950s, the growth of neoliberal organizations and [[think tanks]] from the 1950s through the 1970s, and the spread of neoliberal thought to journalists and politicians. \n* Chapter five (\"Keynesianism and the Emergence of Monetarism, 1945\u201371) discusses [[Keynesianism]], American economic policy in the 1960s, and the development of [[monetarism]] by Milton Friedman. \n* Chapter six (\"Economic Strategy: The Neoliberal Breakthrough, 1971-84\") discusses the [[stagflation]] of the 1970s in the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom]] and how it set the stage for the political rise of [[monetarism]], which ushered in further neoliberal reforms; it continues with a description of the neoliberal policies of British prime ministers [[James Callaghan]] and [[Margaret Thatcher]], [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[Denis Healey]], US presidents [[Jimmy Carter]] and [[Ronald Reagan]], and [[Chair of the Federal Reserve]] [[Paul Volcker]]. \n* Chapter seven (\"Neoliberalism Applied? The Transformation of Affordable Housing and Urban Policy in the United States and Britain, 1945\u20132000\") considers the effects of neoliberal policies on housing and [[urban policy]] in the United States and the United Kingdom.\n* The conclusion (\"The Legacy of Transatlantic Neoliberalism: Faith-Based Policy\") discusses the lasting effects of neoliberalism and lays out the author's belief in the need to return \"reason-based policymaking\" to political and economic debates.\n\n==Summary==\n{{Quote box|quote = \"Neoliberalism was a radical form of [[individualism]] that was first generated before World War II in reaction to [[Social liberalism|New Liberalism]], [[Progressivism]], the [[New Deal]], and the onset of [[Nazi]] and [[communist]] [[totalitarianism]].

However, it was during this time that neoliberal thought was refined and spread, creating a transatlantic network of intellectuals, businessmen, journalists, university departments and [[think tank]]s promoting neoliberal ideas.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|134}} The locus of neoliberal thought shifted from Europe to the United States, with the American intellectuals [[Milton Friedman]] and [[George Stigler]], as well as the larger [[Chicago school of economics]] they were a part of, becoming increasingly influential.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|85}} Neoliberal thought evolved: whereas the neoliberalism that had emerged during the [[interwar period|interwar years]] had been a \"nuanced response\" to war, depression and totalitarian regimes, late-twentieth-century neoliberalism became dominated by [[market liberalization]] and [[globalization]], and galvanized around a defense of the superiority of [[free market]]s to government [[Planned economy|economic planning]].<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|4\u20135}}\n\nThe third phase, lasting from 1980 onward (the book was released in 2012), is the period of neoliberal political hegemony. Jones suggests that the high [[inflation]] and low [[economic growth]] in the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom]] during the 1970s chipped away at the Keynesian political consensus, which seemed unable to address the decade's [[stagflation]].<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|215}} Jones argues that the transatlantic neoliberal network provided a compelling alternative economic ideology\u2014one that conveniently included [[monetarism]], an economic theory dealing with inflation.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|216}} Jones asserts that this led to the widespread political acceptance of neoliberal policies in the 1980s, which brought with it a greater acceptance of neoliberal ideology.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|270}} Jones maintains that, contrary to the opinion of some observers, the adoption of neoliberal policies was not an inevitability; they were not necessarily the \"right\" policies for the challenges of the era, but instead found political power through an \"unpredictable, patchy\" process that had \"luck and historical contingency\" as central players.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|333}} The left-leaning [[Carter administration]] and [[Callaghan government]] were the first to implement particular neoliberal policies,<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|269}} but neoliberalism would find its greatest impact with US president [[Ronald Reagan]] and British prime minister [[Margaret Thatcher]], who would each successfully advance agendas of [[deregulation]], [[tax cut]]s, and [[market liberalization]]. Jones argues that while these incremental policy changes did not require a wholesale acceptance of neoliberal philosophy, by the late 1980s that is exactly what had happened. Neoliberal ideas on the superiority of the market and [[individual liberty]] became widely accepted by politicians and academics, and Jones contends that this \"boundless belief in markets and deregulation\" ultimately led to the [[financial crisis of 2007\u20132008]].<ref name=\"Masters\"/>{{rp|6}}\n\n===First phase: Early history (1920\u20131950)===\nAccording to Jones, neoliberalism traces its earliest beginnings to the establishment of the [[Colloque Walter Lippmann]] in 1938. The [[Great Depression]] left the reputation of [[economic liberalism]] in tatters, and the scholars at the society sought to \"reconstruct a theory of liberalism\" because they believed that \"[[classical liberalism]] was under assault\". They called this reconstruction \"neoliberalism\" to signify that they were not simply accepting [[laissez-faire]] economics but were developing a new vision of economic liberalism. Ultimately, however, the ideas promoted at the colloquium did not take political hold, and at the outset of [[World War II]] the colloquium was largely forgotten.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|31}}\n\nThe destruction wrought by [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] regimes during World War II would, however, energize a number of liberal thinkers in their opposition to [[collectivism]]. From this fear of collectivism emerged the early influential neoliberal texts critiquing [[social democracy]], and led to the formation of a new neoliberal organization by many of the same individuals present at the Colloque Walter Lippman: the [[Mont Pelerin Society]].<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|30\u201331}}\n\n====Mont Pelerin Society====\n[[File:Hoff i Mont Pelerin society.png|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Trygve J.

They painted a hostile portrait of [[trade unions]] and presented [[monopoly|monopolies]] as mostly benign.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|92\u201393}}\n\nThe theories of [[regulatory capture]], [[public choice theory]], and [[rational choice theory]] all became influential to neoliberal thought, according to Jones, because they connected the market to politics and the public sector, and helped the neoliberal view of free markets seep into mainstream public and political consciousness.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|126\u2013133}} The economist George Stigler argued that government regulatory bodies often become captured by private industry, so that these bodies act in the interests of private corporations rather than in the public's interest\u2014a notion known as \"regulatory capture\". James Buchanan and Gordon Tullock, considered the \"fathers of public choice theory\", emphasized the imperfections of political institutions and constitutional mechanisms, and argued voters have a tendency to vote their own interest rather than in the public interest.\n\n====Milton Friedman and monetarism====\n[[File:Portrait of Milton Friedman.jpg|thumb|[[Milton Friedman]]]]\n[[Milton Friedman]] became a leading figure of neoliberal thought and a prominent public intellectual in the 1950s. An American, Friedman was less influenced by the effects of [[World War II]] than by the subsequent [[Cold War]] between the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]]. Jones argues that for neoliberals \"the Cold War necessitated the unambiguous advocacy of the superiority of the market\", and Friedman framed the \"war of ideas\" between [[socialism]] and free-market [[capitalism]] as a \"life-or-death struggle.\"<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|101,120}}\n\nJones argues that \"Friedman's significant contribution to neoliberal thought was his connection of [[economic freedom]] with [[political freedom]]\", which he made in his popular book ''[[Capitalism and Freedom]]'' (which Jones describes as the \"American ''[[Road to Serfdom]]''\").<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|116}} Friedman argued that free markets and liberal democracy are inseparable, that the market guarantees basic political freedoms by ensuring that alternatives are always available (e.g. alternative employment options or alternative goods), guarantees equality by separating divorcing economic activities from reasons unrelated to an individual's [[productivity]], and protects dissent by separating economic power (i.e. the ability to make money) from political power (in other words, politicians cannot deprive an individual of employment if they express political dissent).<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|117,121}} Friedman consistently pointed out his view that \"increases in economic freedom have gone hand in hand with increases in political and civil freedom and have led to increased prosperity; competitive capitalism and freedom have become inseparable\", and pointed to countries like [[China]] under [[Deng Xiaoping]] and [[Chile]] to justify this.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|121}}\n\nJones notes that Friedman was a harsh critic of government intervention in the economy. A key point of ''[[Capitalism and Freedom]]'', according to Jones, was outlining government failure, including in the areas of railroad regulation, [[labor law]], [[monetary policy|monetary]] reform, agriculture, [[public housing]], [[social security]] legislation, [[foreign aid]], [[urban redevelopment]], and [[income tax]].<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|118}} In ''[[A Monetary History of the United States]]'', Friedman blamed the [[Great Depression]] on overly tight monetary policy by the [[Federal Reserve]].<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|202}} Friedman linked [[New Deal]] liberalism with [[socialism]] and [[communism]], while he considered his own ideas as a part of the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] family.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|119}}\n\nFriedman's development of the [[macroeconomics|macroeconomic]] theory [[monetarism]] was particularly influential to neoliberalism. Jones argues that the [[Keynesian]] consensus that had dominated political thought in the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom]] for decades had prioritized low [[unemployment]] over [[inflation]]. In contrast, by the 1950s neoliberal thinkers began to emphasize inflation.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|193}} Friedman ultimately developed [[monetarism]], a [[macroeconomics|macroeconomic]] theory dealing with [[inflation]] and the [[supply of money]] that suggested that the Keynesian view that government can achieve [[full employment]] at the cost of limited inflation was incorrect and would lead to higher inflation in the [[Long run and short run|long run]].<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|207}} Friedman argued that governments and central banks, rather than focusing on employment, should focus on ensuring a constant and predictable level of [[monetary inflation|monetary growth]].<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|207}} Jones describes monetarism as \"the most consistent, systematic, and significant alternative economic strategy to Keynesian demand management and fine-tuning\".<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|201}} This, according to Jones, primed neoliberal theory for political acceptance in the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom]], who would experience persistent [[stagflation]] during the 1970s. Jones sums it up as such: \"Friedman's monetarist analysis and market solutions grabbed people's attention as a ready-made and plausible alternative strategy [to Keynesianism] when the economy began to unravel [in the 1970s] under the weight of stagflation\".<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|212}}\n\n====Think tanks====\nIn Britain and the United States, the neoliberal right built a \"dazzling array of think tanks\", which became the preferred vehicle of neoliberal thinkers.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|336}} Notable among these, according to Jones, were the [[American Enterprise Institute]], the [[Foundation for Economic Education]], the [[Institute of Economic Affairs]], the [[Heritage Foundation]], the [[Cato Institute]], the [[Adam Smith Institute]], and a group of think tanks emanating out of the [[Atlas Network|Atlas Foundation]], including the [[Fraser Institute]], the Fisher Institute, and the [[Manhattan Institute]].<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|134}} These think tanks brought politicians and businesspeople into contact with neoliberal ideas and thinkers and raised the public profile of free-market policies. In particular, the Heritage Foundation had a significant influence on US president [[Ronald Reagan]]\u2014claiming on its website that nearly two-thirds of the proposals they suggested to him in their policy guide ''[[Mandate for Leadership]]'' were implemented<ref>{{cite web |last1=Blasko |first1=Andrew |title=REAGAN AND HERITAGE: A Unique Partnership |url=https://www.heritage.org/conservatism/commentary/reagan-and-heritage-unique-partnership |website=The Heritage Foundation |accessdate=7 August 2019}}</ref>\u2014while the Adam Smith Institute had appreciable sway with the [[Premiership of Margaret Thatcher|Thatcher government]]. Jones notes that many of these institutes were funded by wealthy businessmen, such as [[Charles Koch]] and [[Joseph Coors]].<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|163\u2013164}}\n\n====Relation to conservatism====\nFree market economics has been associated with the [[political right]], but Jones emphasizes that it is \"but one branch\" of it.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|138}} In the United States, he argues that the right had a number of often-competing interests (principally [[Traditionalist conservatism|traditionalism]], [[anticommunism]], and [[neoliberalism]]), but the \"distinctive feature of the conservative revival in the 1950s and 1960s was the ability of its disparate elements to unite under the banners of [[anticommunism]] and [[states' rights]]\"\u2014a union that became known as \"[[fusionism]]\".<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|140}} This union, which Jones largely credits [[William F. Buckley Jr.]] for achieving, led to the growth of a conservative establishment that would, after decades of decline, rival its liberal opponents.

The collapse of the [[Bretton Woods system|Bretton Woods international monetary system]] in 1971 indicated the end of the experiment with [[fixed exchange rates]]. The assumption that there was a relatively simple and manipulable trade-off between [[inflation]] and [[employment]], the famous [[Phillips Curve]]...proved to be a dangerous illusion...In both Britain and the United States, the appearance of [[stagflation]]...meant that governments felt forced to change course.\"<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|1\u20132}}|align = right |width = 20%}}\nJones notes that there were two major issues facing the United States and the United Kingdom at the end of the 1960s: the instability of the [[Bretton Woods system|Bretton Woods international monetary system]] and high [[inflation]].<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|219\u2013220}} As Jones describes it: \"the late 1960s and early 1970s brought a succession of economic shocks that undermined the postwar international monetary system and pushed the world economy into stormy waters. The final stage in the shift in economic strategy in Britain and the United States, the reason neoliberal ideas found a receptive audience, was the force of these events.\" The proposed neoliberal solutions of [[monetarism]], [[deregulation]], and [[trade union]] reform, as well as the wealth of neoliberal arguments against the prevailing Keynesian demand management, provided a \"powerfully compelling logic\", and neoliberal policies were soon adopted by British and American politicians.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|15}} Yet these economic solutions acted as mere \"Trojan horses for a more polemical neoliberal faith in free markets\", which would come to dominate politics in the United States and the United Kingdom.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|13}}\n[[Image:US Historical Inflation.svg|thumb|Rate of inflation in the United States (1914-2009)|left]]\n\nNeoliberal policies, according to Jones, were first introduced in the United States by [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] president [[Jimmy Carter]] and in the United Kingdom by [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] prime minister [[James Callaghan]].

They aimed to construct a distinctly new liberalism (hence \"neoliberalism\") by charting a middle way between the [[laissez-faire]] economics of the pre-[[Great Depression|Depression]] era and the \"[[collectivism]]\" of [[New Deal]] liberalism and British [[social democracy]]. He argues that between the 1950s and 1970s this commitment evolved into one of greater conviction in the superiority of the [[free market]], such that by the 1980s neoliberal policy proposals centered almost entirely around [[market liberalization]]. Modern neoliberalism, according to Jones, is associated with [[economic liberalism]], [[monetarism]], and a staunch support of [[free market]] [[capitalism]], and advocates political policies of [[deregulation]], [[privatization]], and other market-based reforms.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|1}}\n\nJones structures the book around what he argues are the three phases of the history of neoliberalism. In the first, lasting from roughly 1920 until 1950, he details how early European neoliberal thinkers like [[Friedrich Hayek]], [[Ludwig von Mises]], and [[Karl Popper]], motivated by expanding government and later the rise of totalitarian regimes in Europe during [[World War II]], developed critiques of \"[[collectivism]]\", which to them included British [[social democracy]] and American [[New Deal]] liberalism. Particularly influential during this time was the formation of the [[Mont Pelerin Society]], which brought together intellectuals committed to the defense of [[liberalism]] and [[individualism]]. In the second phase, lasting from roughly 1950 until 1980, the locus of neoliberal thought moved to the [[United States]], where academics like [[Milton Friedman]] and [[George Stigler]] built upon the earlier neoliberal foundation by developing new academic and political arguments and introducing a range of neoliberal policy prescriptions. It was during this time that Jones contends neoliberal thought evolved from its more moderate early stance into a \"faith\" in the power and efficiency of markets. Jones argues that during this period a transatlantic network of intellectuals, businessmen, journalists, and [[think tanks]] arose to promote neoliberal ideology, slowly moving neoliberalism out of the political fringes and into the mainstream. The third phase, taking place after 1980, was the period of neoliberal political prominence. After a decade of [[stagflation]] in the United States and the United Kingdom, the neoliberal alternative to the [[Keynesian]] consensus that had dominated politics was adopted by politicians, finding particular influence with US president [[Ronald Reagan]] and British prime minister [[Margaret Thatcher]]. This era, Jones notes, was characterized by sweeping [[deregulation]], [[market liberalization]], and [[tax cut|tax reductions]].\n\n==Structure==\nThe book is divided into an introduction, seven chapters, and a conclusion.<ref name =\"Masters\">{{cite book|url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/9827.html|title=Masters of the Universe: Hayek, Friedman, and the Birth of Neoliberal Politics|last=Stedman Jones|first=Daniel|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2012|isbn=978-0691151571|ref=harv}}</ref> \n* The introduction summarizes the history of [[neoliberalism]] and lays out the structure of the book. \n* Chapter one (\"The Postwar Settlement\") provides context for the rise of neoliberalism by briefly describing the development of [[embedded liberalism]] and [[Keynesianism]] after the [[Great Depression]]. \n* Chapter two (\"The 1940s: The Emergence of the Neoliberal Critique\") discusses the critiques of [[social democracy]] by the early neoliberals [[Karl Popper]], [[Ludwig von Mises]], and [[Friedrich Hayek]], and outlines the birth of the [[Mont Pelerin Society]].\n* Chapter three (\"The Rising Tide: Neoliberal Ideas in the Postwar Period) discusses the two [[Chicago school of economics|Chicago School]]s, the relation of [[Adam Smith]] to neoliberalism, the early ideas of [[Milton Friedman]], the [[ordoliberal]]s in [[West Germany]], and the economic theories of [[regulatory capture]], [[public choice]], and [[rational choice theory]]. \n* Chapter four (\"A Transatlantic Nework: Think Tanks and the Ideological Entrepreneurs\") discusses [[fusionism]] in the [[United States]], [[conservatism]] in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] during the 1950s, the growth of neoliberal organizations and [[think tanks]] from the 1950s through the 1970s, and the spread of neoliberal thought to journalists and politicians. \n* Chapter five (\"Keynesianism and the Emergence of Monetarism, 1945\u201371) discusses [[Keynesianism]], American economic policy in the 1960s, and the development of [[monetarism]] by Milton Friedman. \n* Chapter six (\"Economic Strategy: The Neoliberal Breakthrough, 1971-84\") discusses the [[stagflation]] of the 1970s in the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom]] and how it set the stage for the political rise of [[monetarism]], which ushered in further neoliberal reforms; it continues with a description of the neoliberal policies of British prime ministers [[James Callaghan]] and [[Margaret Thatcher]], [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[Denis Healey]], US presidents [[Jimmy Carter]] and [[Ronald Reagan]], and [[Chair of the Federal Reserve]] [[Paul Volcker]]. \n* Chapter seven (\"Neoliberalism Applied?

However, it was during this time that neoliberal thought was refined and spread, creating a transatlantic network of intellectuals, businessmen, journalists, university departments and [[think tank]]s promoting neoliberal ideas.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|134}} The locus of neoliberal thought shifted from Europe to the United States, with the American intellectuals [[Milton Friedman]] and [[George Stigler]], as well as the larger [[Chicago school of economics]] they were a part of, becoming increasingly influential.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|85}} Neoliberal thought evolved: whereas the neoliberalism that had emerged during the [[interwar period|interwar years]] had been a \"nuanced response\" to war, depression and totalitarian regimes, late-twentieth-century neoliberalism became dominated by [[market liberalization]] and [[globalization]], and galvanized around a defense of the superiority of [[free market]]s to government [[Planned economy|economic planning]].<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|4\u20135}}\n\nThe third phase, lasting from 1980 onward (the book was released in 2012), is the period of neoliberal political hegemony.

Jones argues that while these incremental policy changes did not require a wholesale acceptance of neoliberal philosophy, by the late 1980s that is exactly what had happened. Neoliberal ideas on the superiority of the market and [[individual liberty]] became widely accepted by politicians and academics, and Jones contends that this \"boundless belief in markets and deregulation\" ultimately led to the [[financial crisis of 2007\u20132008]].<ref name=\"Masters\"/>{{rp|6}}\n\n===First phase: Early history (1920\u20131950)===\nAccording to Jones, neoliberalism traces its earliest beginnings to the establishment of the [[Colloque Walter Lippmann]] in 1938. The [[Great Depression]] left the reputation of [[economic liberalism]] in tatters, and the scholars at the society sought to \"reconstruct a theory of liberalism\" because they believed that \"[[classical liberalism]] was under assault\". They called this reconstruction \"neoliberalism\" to signify that they were not simply accepting [[laissez-faire]] economics but were developing a new vision of economic liberalism. Ultimately, however, the ideas promoted at the colloquium did not take political hold, and at the outset of [[World War II]] the colloquium was largely forgotten.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|31}}\n\nThe destruction wrought by [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] regimes during World War II would, however, energize a number of liberal thinkers in their opposition to [[collectivism]]. From this fear of collectivism emerged the early influential neoliberal texts critiquing [[social democracy]], and led to the formation of a new neoliberal organization by many of the same individuals present at the Colloque Walter Lippman: the [[Mont Pelerin Society]].<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|30\u201331}}\n\n====Mont Pelerin Society====\n[[File:Hoff i Mont Pelerin society.png|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Trygve J.

Friedman himself advocated a level of government intervention in the essay which he would never again publicly support.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|97}}\n\n====Academic thought====\nAccording to Jones: \"After 1945, a distinct neoliberal worldview was built on the foundations of the critique of [[New Deal]] liberalism and [[social democracy]] synthesized in the writings of [[Ludwig von Mises]], [[Friedrich Hayek]], and [[Karl Popper]]...Its main tenets\u2014philosophical, political, and economic\u2014were worked out in detail by scholars such as [[Milton Friedman]], [[George Stigler]], [[Gary Becker]], [[James Buchanan]], and [[Gordon Tullock]], as well as Hayek and Mises.\"<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|85}}\n\nJones asserts that the [[Chicago school of economics]], of which Friedman and Stigler were a part, was \"perhaps the most influential group in terms of the development of transatlantic neoliberal politics\".<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|89}} In the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s Chicago economists published influential works arguing for [[free market]] policies and extending free market analyses into new regions (e.g. law and regulation). They painted a hostile portrait of [[trade unions]] and presented [[monopoly|monopolies]] as mostly benign.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|92\u201393}}\n\nThe theories of [[regulatory capture]], [[public choice theory]], and [[rational choice theory]] all became influential to neoliberal thought, according to Jones, because they connected the market to politics and the public sector, and helped the neoliberal view of free markets seep into mainstream public and political consciousness.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|126\u2013133}} The economist George Stigler argued that government regulatory bodies often become captured by private industry, so that these bodies act in the interests of private corporations rather than in the public's interest\u2014a notion known as \"regulatory capture\". James Buchanan and Gordon Tullock, considered the \"fathers of public choice theory\", emphasized the imperfections of political institutions and constitutional mechanisms, and argued voters have a tendency to vote their own interest rather than in the public interest.\n\n====Milton Friedman and monetarism====\n[[File:Portrait of Milton Friedman.jpg|thumb|[[Milton Friedman]]]]\n[[Milton Friedman]] became a leading figure of neoliberal thought and a prominent public intellectual in the 1950s. An American, Friedman was less influenced by the effects of [[World War II]] than by the subsequent [[Cold War]] between the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]]. Jones argues that for neoliberals \"the Cold War necessitated the unambiguous advocacy of the superiority of the market\", and Friedman framed the \"war of ideas\" between [[socialism]] and free-market [[capitalism]] as a \"life-or-death struggle.\"<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|101,120}}\n\nJones argues that \"Friedman's significant contribution to neoliberal thought was his connection of [[economic freedom]] with [[political freedom]]\", which he made in his popular book ''[[Capitalism and Freedom]]'' (which Jones describes as the \"American ''[[Road to Serfdom]]''\").<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|116}} Friedman argued that free markets and liberal democracy are inseparable, that the market guarantees basic political freedoms by ensuring that alternatives are always available (e.g. alternative employment options or alternative goods), guarantees equality by separating divorcing economic activities from reasons unrelated to an individual's [[productivity]], and protects dissent by separating economic power (i.e. the ability to make money) from political power (in other words, politicians cannot deprive an individual of employment if they express political dissent).<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|117,121}} Friedman consistently pointed out his view that \"increases in economic freedom have gone hand in hand with increases in political and civil freedom and have led to increased prosperity; competitive capitalism and freedom have become inseparable\", and pointed to countries like [[China]] under [[Deng Xiaoping]] and [[Chile]] to justify this.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|121}}\n\nJones notes that Friedman was a harsh critic of government intervention in the economy. A key point of ''[[Capitalism and Freedom]]'', according to Jones, was outlining government failure, including in the areas of railroad regulation, [[labor law]], [[monetary policy|monetary]] reform, agriculture, [[public housing]], [[social security]] legislation, [[foreign aid]], [[urban redevelopment]], and [[income tax]].<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|118}} In ''[[A Monetary History of the United States]]'', Friedman blamed the [[Great Depression]] on overly tight monetary policy by the [[Federal Reserve]].<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|202}} Friedman linked [[New Deal]] liberalism with [[socialism]] and [[communism]], while he considered his own ideas as a part of the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] family.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|119}}\n\nFriedman's development of the [[macroeconomics|macroeconomic]] theory [[monetarism]] was particularly influential to neoliberalism. Jones argues that the [[Keynesian]] consensus that had dominated political thought in the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom]] for decades had prioritized low [[unemployment]] over [[inflation]]. In contrast, by the 1950s neoliberal thinkers began to emphasize inflation.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|193}} Friedman ultimately developed [[monetarism]], a [[macroeconomics|macroeconomic]] theory dealing with [[inflation]] and the [[supply of money]] that suggested that the Keynesian view that government can achieve [[full employment]] at the cost of limited inflation was incorrect and would lead to higher inflation in the [[Long run and short run|long run]].<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|207}} Friedman argued that governments and central banks, rather than focusing on employment, should focus on ensuring a constant and predictable level of [[monetary inflation|monetary growth]].<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|207}} Jones describes monetarism as \"the most consistent, systematic, and significant alternative economic strategy to Keynesian demand management and fine-tuning\".<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|201}} This, according to Jones, primed neoliberal theory for political acceptance in the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom]], who would experience persistent [[stagflation]] during the 1970s. Jones sums it up as such: \"Friedman's monetarist analysis and market solutions grabbed people's attention as a ready-made and plausible alternative strategy [to Keynesianism] when the economy began to unravel [in the 1970s] under the weight of stagflation\".<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|212}}\n\n====Think tanks====\nIn Britain and the United States, the neoliberal right built a \"dazzling array of think tanks\", which became the preferred vehicle of neoliberal thinkers.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|336}} Notable among these, according to Jones, were the [[American Enterprise Institute]], the [[Foundation for Economic Education]], the [[Institute of Economic Affairs]], the [[Heritage Foundation]], the [[Cato Institute]], the [[Adam Smith Institute]], and a group of think tanks emanating out of the [[Atlas Network|Atlas Foundation]], including the [[Fraser Institute]], the Fisher Institute, and the [[Manhattan Institute]].<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|134}} These think tanks brought politicians and businesspeople into contact with neoliberal ideas and thinkers and raised the public profile of free-market policies. In particular, the Heritage Foundation had a significant influence on US president [[Ronald Reagan]]\u2014claiming on its website that nearly two-thirds of the proposals they suggested to him in their policy guide ''[[Mandate for Leadership]]'' were implemented<ref>{{cite web |last1=Blasko |first1=Andrew |title=REAGAN AND HERITAGE: A Unique Partnership |url=https://www.heritage.org/conservatism/commentary/reagan-and-heritage-unique-partnership |website=The Heritage Foundation |accessdate=7 August 2019}}</ref>\u2014while the Adam Smith Institute had appreciable sway with the [[Premiership of Margaret Thatcher|Thatcher government]]. Jones notes that many of these institutes were funded by wealthy businessmen, such as [[Charles Koch]] and [[Joseph Coors]].<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|163\u2013164}}\n\n====Relation to conservatism====\nFree market economics has been associated with the [[political right]], but Jones emphasizes that it is \"but one branch\" of it.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|138}} In the United States, he argues that the right had a number of often-competing interests (principally [[Traditionalist conservatism|traditionalism]], [[anticommunism]], and [[neoliberalism]]), but the \"distinctive feature of the conservative revival in the 1950s and 1960s was the ability of its disparate elements to unite under the banners of [[anticommunism]] and [[states' rights]]\"\u2014a union that became known as \"[[fusionism]]\".<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|140}} This union, which Jones largely credits [[William F. Buckley Jr.]] for achieving, led to the growth of a conservative establishment that would, after decades of decline, rival its liberal opponents.

The collapse of the [[Bretton Woods system|Bretton Woods international monetary system]] in 1971 indicated the end of the experiment with [[fixed exchange rates]]. The assumption that there was a relatively simple and manipulable trade-off between [[inflation]] and [[employment]], the famous [[Phillips Curve]]...proved to be a dangerous illusion...In both Britain and the United States, the appearance of [[stagflation]]...meant that governments felt forced to change course.\"<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|1\u20132}}|align = right |width = 20%}}\nJones notes that there were two major issues facing the United States and the United Kingdom at the end of the 1960s: the instability of the [[Bretton Woods system|Bretton Woods international monetary system]] and high [[inflation]].<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|219\u2013220}} As Jones describes it: \"the late 1960s and early 1970s brought a succession of economic shocks that undermined the postwar international monetary system and pushed the world economy into stormy waters. The final stage in the shift in economic strategy in Britain and the United States, the reason neoliberal ideas found a receptive audience, was the force of these events.\" The proposed neoliberal solutions of [[monetarism]], [[deregulation]], and [[trade union]] reform, as well as the wealth of neoliberal arguments against the prevailing Keynesian demand management, provided a \"powerfully compelling logic\", and neoliberal policies were soon adopted by British and American politicians.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|15}} Yet these economic solutions acted as mere \"Trojan horses for a more polemical neoliberal faith in free markets\", which would come to dominate politics in the United States and the United Kingdom.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|13}}\n[[Image:US Historical Inflation.svg|thumb|Rate of inflation in the United States (1914-2009)|left]]\n\nNeoliberal policies, according to Jones, were first introduced in the United States by [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] president [[Jimmy Carter]] and in the United Kingdom by [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] prime minister [[James Callaghan]].
