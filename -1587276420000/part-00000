On the way back, to avoid classmate Osamu Akaishi, who has a crush on Wakaba, Ko joins a sandlot baseball game organized by another classmate, Daiki Nakanishi. Because he has never played before, Ko [[Baseball positions|fields]] badly, but because he has practiced in the Tsukishima family's [[batting cage]]s he hits the game-winning [[home run]]. After their joint 11th birthday, Wakaba gives Ko a schedule of birthday presents for him to give her through age 20.

Starting pitcher Keiichiro Senda, who considers himself popular, asks her out on a date without waiting for a response. When she does not show up, Senda goes to her house but is frightened off by the family cat. When Ko (in his third year at Seishu Junior High) delivers baseballs to the Tsukishima batting cages, he hits four home runs, which annoys Aoba, especially since she cannot match it. In a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]], she remembers Wakaba telling her about Ko's potential to one day pitch {{convert|100|mph|km/h|sp=us|adj=on}} [[fastball]]s, which Aoba claimed was her ideal in a man, but that if he does, Aoba cannot take him from her.

Akaishi, now captain of the junior high school baseball team, watches the sandlot game and is reminded of Wakaba's boasts about Ko's abilities. With Ko's fielding and [[Batting (baseball)|batting]], his team wins in a close game. Afterward Nakanishi learns that Ko did not join the baseball team, despite his surprisingly fast fastball, because Nakanishi had been kicked off it for fighting.

Akaishi takes over Ko's training on the condition that Nakanishi return to the baseball team. At the Tsukishima batting cages, an unknown boy breaks Ko's home run record but complains about how slow the [[pitching machine]]s are. The boy later appears at Seishu High School, being given a tour for prospective baseball players. Senda visits Aoba while she is working in the Clover Cafe attached to the batting cages and asks about Ko's secret training, but she denies any knowledge about random neighbors.

After Momiji tells Aoba about a time Ko played with her when no one else would, Aoba tells Ko that she will never be a good sister like Wakaba, then gets mad when he tells her she is not that worthless. Ko cooks New Year [[soba]] for Momiji and himself, but Aoba makes her own [[instant noodles]].

When Ko, Akaishi, and Nakanishi watch her pitch, Daimon tells them it does not matter if she pitches too much because, as a girl, she cannot play in a tournament game. When Azuma takes his turn at bat, he asks her to not hold back, and in response she insists that Akaishi be her catcher. Pitching her fastest, she almost [[Strikeout|strikes out]] Azuma. After Akaishi accuses Azuma of not being manly for deliberately [[List of baseball jargon (F)#foul off|fouling back]], Azuma hits a home run on the next pitch and Aoba collapses exhausted.

Daimon tells Shido that an upcoming [[Exhibition game|scrimmage]] between varsity and prefab teams will demonstrate how much better the varsity players are. Because of a rumor that prefab players who perform well might be promoted to varsity, the third-year players train hard. Before the scrimmage, Ko has Aoba catch his pitches because he has never played in a real game and so has no comparison for his pitching. She calls them okay, which pleases him as the best compliment he can expect from her, and makes a bet that he will hold the varsity team to ten runs, which she changes to five runs after looking at her bruised hand.

At the bottom of the sixth, a tiring Ko tells catcher Akaishi that he can no longer pitch with both speed and control, and Akaishi has him go for speed. After Azuma hits another home run, Akaishi tells him the pitch was weak because this is Ko's first real game. When a third-year prefab player, Makihara, is thrown out while running for home, Senda tells him Daimon has no intention of promoting anyone to the varsity team because that would mean admitting he was wrong.

In Seishu's next game, Daimon takes Miki out of the [[Batting order (baseball)|lineup]] for ignoring his orders.

In the seventh inning, Aoba hits a single and then scores on Senda's [[sacrifice fly]]. During the final innings, Azuma asks Daimon if he wishes he had better hitters in his lineup, such as Miki, and as Ko strikes out the final three batters, Azuma says Ko is now the best pitcher they have played against all year.

That evening, Akaishi reviews tapes of Ryuo's games one more time, particularly Shimano's batting, while the rest of the team prepares their equipment. The next morning, after a press conference for ''Idol Ace'', former manager Risa tunes in to the start of the game. In the first inning, Ryuo quickly [[Strikeout|retires]] all three Seishu batters, and Ko strikes out three Ryuo batters with nine pitches. In the second inning, Azuma hits a home run on the first pitch, while Shimano hits a single but is [[left on base]]. At the top of the fourth inning, Seishu still leading 1 to 0, Mishima asks to be sent out to the [[first base coach]] box during Ryuo's next at-bat.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 28\n| Title               = Let's End This\n| TranslitTitle       = Owarase y\u014dze\n| NativeTitle         = \u7d42\u308f\u3089\u305b\u3088\u3046\u305c\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2009|10|11|df=y}}<ref name=\"airdates-ep27-39\"/>\n| ShortSummary        = In the top of the fourth inning, Azuma hits a double but again fails to score. In the bottom of the inning, Mishima stands in the first base coach box, where he tells first-baseman Azuma he is having fun. Akaishi and Aoba are both impressed by Ko's pitching, and the end of six innings, with the score unchanged, Ko has struck out 10 of 18 batters. In the seventh inning, Shimano breaks a finger fielding Azuma's hit and is replaced by Mishima, making Ko and Akaishi worry about Seishu's chances. When Mishama bats, later that inning, he hits a [[Home run#Grand slam|solo home run]] to tie the game at 1. At the top of the ninth, Senda hits a single, thus ensuring that the best hitters of both teams, Azuma and Mishima, will bat again. As Azuma comes to bat with two outs, Ryuo sends out Oikawa as [[relief pitcher]], and he intentionally walks Azuma before striking out Akaishi. Ko sacrifices control for speed to pitch to Mishima, who manages to hit a blazing [[line drive]] that Ko barely catches.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 29\n| Title               = No I'm Not!\n| TranslitTitle       = Dare gya?\n| NativeTitle         = \u3060\u308c\u304e\u3083?\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2009|10|18|df=y}}<ref name=\"airdates-ep27-39\"/>\n| ShortSummary        = Ko strikes out the last Ryuo batter, sending the game into [[extra innings]], tied 1 to 1. At the top of the tenth, Ko loses control of his bat before successfully bunting, but is left on base. In the bottom of the inning, after fouling off Ko's fastball, a Ryuo batter loses his bat because his hands are numb from the previous pitch. With a runner on second, Oikawa hits a line drive that Ko, with his arm still affected by Mishima's hit, fails to catch. The runner scores, and Ryuo wins the game. After the game, Ko apologizes to a disappointed Aoba for losing, but she manages to smile. Ryuo goes on to easily win the prefectural tournament and their first game at Koshien. When Ko apologizes to Azuma for failing to make the play, Azuma tells him to focus instead on Aoba's disappointment at not being able to play in tournament games.

Mizuki invites Aoba to a [[Japanese festivals|summer festival]] the next day. Ko dreams of going to the festival with Wakaba, as she promised before she died, then of running to meet Akane at the Takigawa's soba restaurant. The next day, the anniversary of Wakaba's death, Aoba tells Ko to report his tournament result to Wakaba when he visits her grave. On his way back, he meets Akane wearing a [[yukata]] similar to Wakaba's. On her way to Wakaba's grave, Aoba sees them walking together and asks Mizuki if ghosts grow up.

While delivering it, Akane learns that Aoba had an older sister, Wakaba, who died.  Aoba quite bluntly asks Ko and Akane that she wishes to continue cleaning and could they please leave. When Akaishi helps his father deliver liquor to the Takigawa soba shop, he again is shocked by Akane's appearance, dropping a complimentary glass, after which Akane learns from Senda (who happened to drop in whilst Akaishi was there) of her resemblance to Wakaba.

Aoba tells Azuma she will try out for the women's national team in March, and when she teases him about being given [[Valentine's Day#Asia|chocolates]] for [[Valentine's Day]], he says the only girl he would consider going out with is her. For Valentine's Day, both Aoba and Azuma receive many chocolates. When Aoba drops Ko's chocolates off a bridge, she buys replacements, including one extra to give to Azuma for her. When Ko delivers it, Azuma says that he likes Aoba because she is hard to figure out, because she is not true to herself. That evening, Akane asks Ko to show her photographs of Wakaba. As she looks through his albums, she comments that it is obvious Wakaba loved him, and would still love him today.

During the quarterfinal game, Akaishi is still distracted, but with Ko's improved control while still maintaining his speed, plus Azuma's batting, Seishu wins.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 46\n| Title               = I've Got a Bad Feeling\n| TranslitTitle       = Y\u0101 na Kanji Da n\u0101\n| NativeTitle         = \u3084\u30fc\u306a\u611f\u3058\u3060\u306a\u30a1\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2010|2|21|df=y}}<ref name=\"airdates-ep40-50\"/>\n| ShortSummary        = Akaishi and Aoba visit Akane in the hospital, where she tells them that she promised to go on a date with Ko after the tournament, and that she may require surgery. In the semifinal, Seishu plays Nishikura, a team that has come from behind to win every game by one run. Senda hits a home run on first pitch of the game, and Nishikura scores a run in the first inning as well. Spurred by Akane's worries, Akaishi hits another home run in the second inning. In the eighth inning, with Nishikura having failed to get on base since the second inning, Seishu scores six runs. Nishikura does not score in the bottom of the inning and the game is called for Seishu, 8 to 1. After the game, Ko finally visits Akane in the hospital for the first time, where he praises Akaishi's performance and then asks when her surgery is.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 47\n| Title               = Can I Lie?\n| TranslitTitle       = Uso Tsuite mo Ii ka?\n| NativeTitle         = \u30a6\u30bd\u3064\u3044\u3066\u3082\u3044\u3044\u304b?\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2010|3|7|df=y}}<ref name=\"airdates-ep40-50\"/>\n| ShortSummary        = Ko promises Akane he will tell Akaishi that she will be out in a couple days, saying that he is a pretty good liar. Akane tells him that her surgery will be on the day of the tournament final against heavily favored Ryuo, so she will have to put off their date, then asks him to tell Aoba the truth. Ko tells Akaishi the lie, then asks Aoba to visit Wakaba's grave with him. While there, he prays that the surgery is successful and tells Aoba that Wakaba would not let her cry again. At practice, when Aoba jokingly asks Azuma out to a movie, he asks if she means to ask him out so lightly, saying he seriously likes her. The morning before the game, Aoba asks Ko if he likes Akane more than herself, to which he asks if he can lie.  While warming up in the stadium, Ko spots Momiji, who flashes him a [[peace sign]], after which he celebrates. At the hospital, when Akane's surgery is over, Aoba tells Momiji by [[text message]] to give Ko a peace sign to tell him it was successful.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 48\n| Title               = All Right\n| TranslitTitle       = Yoshi\n| NativeTitle         = \u3088\u3057\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2010|3|14|df=y}}<ref name=\"airdates-ep40-50\"/>\n| ShortSummary        = Aoba arrives at the stadium in time to see Ko's first pitch at the bottom of the first inning. On the mound, Ko tells Akaishi about Akane's surgery, and Akaishi is annoyed at being kept in the dark. Ko consistently pitches over 94&nbsp;mph and retires all three batters with two [[strikeout]]s. Before batting in the second inning, Azuma tells Akaishi his only regret staying with Seishu is never getting to face Ko's pitches. Ryuo's pitcher Oikawa walks Azuma but [[Striking out the side|strikes out the rest of the side]]. In the bottom of the second, Mishima gets on base with a [[drag bunt]], and while on first base tells Azuma he did it to keep Ko from having a no-hitter. No other batters get on base in the first six innings except by walks. In the seventh inning, Azuma hits a single, then is batted in by Akaishi, a hit that Akane watches from her hospital room. Seishu leads 1 to 0.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 49\n| Title               = Are You Having Fun?\n| TranslitTitle       = Tanoshinderu ka?\n| NativeTitle         = \u697d\u3057\u3093\u3067\u308b\u304b?\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2010|3|21|df=y}}<ref name=\"airdates-ep40-50\"/>\n| ShortSummary        = In the seventh inning, Ko strikes out Mishima with pitches reaching the high 90s&nbsp;mph, though Ko is disappointed he did not show Aoba a 100&nbsp;mph fastball as he promised before the game. In the eighth inning, Oikawa tries to repeat the previous year's line drive to Ko, but Ko catches it. In the bottom of the ninth, Ryuo manages to score, sending the game into extra innings, tied 1 to 1. In the top of the 10th, Azuma hits a triple, after which Oikawa intentionally walks Akaishi and Ko, to load the bases with no outs. However, Seishu's last three batters are unable to hit, stranding the runners on base. As Seishu takes the field, Azuma warns Ko to not let Mishima get on base or Ryuo will keep the momentum. With Ko still pitching in the high 90s&nbsp;mph, Mishima hits a hard line drive to first that Azuma barely catches. Aoba remembers seeing Ko cry while practicing pitching shortly after Wakaba died. In the top of the 12th with two outs, when Ko comes to bat he remembers hitting home runs in the Tsukishima batting cages, and as he does so hits a home run.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 50\n| Title               = More Than Anyone in the World...\n| TranslitTitle       = Sekaij\u016b de Ichiban...\n| NativeTitle         = \u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u3067\u4e00\u756a\u2026\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2010|3|28|df=y}}<ref name=\"airdates-ep40-50\"/>\n| ShortSummary        = In the bottom of the 12th with Seishu leading 2 to 1, because Ko is tiring, Akaishi tells him to pitch all out to decide the game now. With two outs and a runner on first, Mishima comes to bat. Still pitching in the high 90s&nbsp;mph, after reaching a full count, Ko walks Mishima with what Junpei calls the fastest pitch of the day also that Aoba and Mishima was shocked about that pitch. As Aoba watches Ko strike out the last batter, she remembers what he said before the game: that Seishu would go to Koshien, he would pitch 100&nbsp;mph, and he loves her more than anyone. After the game Ko hugs Aoba, who slaps him, saying she hates him more than anyone, then cries into his chest.\n\nThe morning before traveling to Koshien, Akaishi visits Akane in the hospital, Nakanishi consoles Azuma for losing Aoba, and Aoba and Ko meet at a cafe near the train station, where they talk about Wakaba and Akane's influence. When leaving the cafe Aoba has to drag Ko to the station (by holding hands), while waiting for the train Ko asks, \"how long are we going to hold hands?\" which she replies with, \"You can let go if you don't like it.\" the scene ends with them waiting for the train, still holding hands. During the closing credits, Ichiyo Tsukishima and Junpei Azuma get married.\n}}\n|}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of Cross Game characters]]\n* [[List of Cross Game chapters]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.tv-tokyo.co.jp/contents/crossgame/index.html ''Cross Game'' anime official site] {{in lang|ja}}\n* [http://www.vizanime.com/cross-game ''Cross Game'' anime official English site]\n* {{ann|anime|10580|Cross Game}}\n\n[[Category:Lists of anime episodes|Cross Game]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:List of ''Cross Game'' episodes}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=December 2012}}\n[[Image:Cross Game DVDv1.jpg|200px|right|thumb|alt=DVD cover with, above, an orange banner and the title written in Japanese script at the top; below, a frowning girl in a school uniform stands with arms crossed, her back to a boy in baseball uniform holding a glove and ball, with a circled numeral 1 on the right|Cover of the Japanese DVD release of ''[[Cross Game]]'' volume 1, showing Ko (left) and Aoba]]\n''[[Cross Game]]'' is an [[anime]] television series based on the [[manga]] series of the same name written and illustrated by [[Mitsuru Adachi]] and published by [[Shogakukan]].<ref name=\"anime-staff\"/><ref name=\"shogakukan\">{{cite web|url=http://websunday.net/crossgame/ |script-title=ja:\u30af\u30ed\u30b9\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0 |trans-title=Cross Game |publisher=[[Shogakukan]] |language=Japanese |accessdate=8 April 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5noROwaw3?url=http://websunday.net/crossgame/ |archivedate=25 February 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The series is about the [[High school baseball in Japan|high school]] [[baseball]] players Ko Kitamura and Aoba Tsukishima and their attempts to fulfill the dream of Aoba's dead sister, Wakaba, of seeing them play in the [[Japanese High School Baseball Championship|national high school championship tournament]] in [[Koshien Stadium]].\n\nThe anime adaptation is produced by [[SynergySP]] and directed by Osamu Sekita, with character designs by Yuuji Kond\u014d and music by [[Kotaro Nakagawa]].<ref name=\"anime-staff\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tv-tokyo.co.jp/contents/crossgame/staff/index.html |script-title=ja:\u3042\u306b\u3066\u308c\uff1a\u30af\u30ed\u30b9\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0 \u30b9\u30bf\u30c3\u30d5 |trans-title=Anime TV: Cross Game Staff |publisher=[[TV Tokyo]] |language=Japanese |accessdate=7 July 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5noRXAbDR?url=http://www.tv-tokyo.co.jp/contents/crossgame/staff/index.html |archivedate=25 February 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The series began broadcasting on the [[TV Tokyo]] network on 5 April 2009 in the 10:00\u201310:30&nbsp;am slot;<ref name=\"anime-airtime\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tv-tokyo.co.jp/contents/crossgame/onair/index.html |script-title=ja:\u3042\u306b\u3066\u308c\uff1a\u30af\u30ed\u30b9\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0 |trans-title=Anime TV: Cross Game |publisher=[[TV Tokyo]] |language=Japanese |accessdate=7 July 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5noRemCGZ?url=http://www.tv-tokyo.co.jp/contents/crossgame/onair/index.html |archivedate=25 February 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref> episodes began syndication later in April 2009 on [[AT-X (company)|AT-X]] and other channels in Japan, and finished airing with episode 50 on 28 March 2010.

On the way back, to avoid classmate Osamu Akaishi, who has a crush on Wakaba, Ko joins a sandlot baseball game organized by another classmate, Daiki Nakanishi. Because he has never played before, Ko [[Baseball positions|fields]] badly, but because he has practiced in the Tsukishima family's [[batting cage]]s he hits the game-winning [[home run]]. After their joint 11th birthday, Wakaba gives Ko a schedule of birthday presents for him to give her through age 20. Soon after this, Wakaba drowns while saving a younger girl at an overnight swimming camp.

Starting pitcher Keiichiro Senda, who considers himself popular, asks her out on a date without waiting for a response. When she does not show up, Senda goes to her house but is frightened off by the family cat. When Ko (in his third year at Seishu Junior High) delivers baseballs to the Tsukishima batting cages, he hits four home runs, which annoys Aoba, especially since she cannot match it. In a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]], she remembers Wakaba telling her about Ko's potential to one day pitch {{convert|100|mph|km/h|sp=us|adj=on}} [[fastball]]s, which Aoba claimed was her ideal in a man, but that if he does, Aoba cannot take him from her.

Meanwhile, when Aoba plays catch with her little sister, Momiji, she is startled to learn that Momiji can handle her hardest throws because Momiji has helped Ko practice. Akaishi, now captain of the junior high school baseball team, watches the sandlot game and is reminded of Wakaba's boasts about Ko's abilities. With Ko's fielding and [[Batting (baseball)|batting]], his team wins in a close game. Afterward Nakanishi learns that Ko did not join the baseball team, despite his surprisingly fast fastball, because Nakanishi had been kicked off it for fighting.

Akaishi takes over Ko's training on the condition that Nakanishi return to the baseball team. At the Tsukishima batting cages, an unknown boy breaks Ko's home run record but complains about how slow the [[pitching machine]]s are.

Senda visits Aoba while she is working in the Clover Cafe attached to the batting cages and asks about Ko's secret training, but she denies any knowledge about random neighbors.

Unlike Aoba, Ko is a decent cook, and his porridge tastes just the way Wakaba prepared it for Aoba. After Momiji tells Aoba about a time Ko played with her when no one else would, Aoba tells Ko that she will never be a good sister like Wakaba, then gets mad when he tells her she is not that worthless. Ko cooks New Year [[soba]] for Momiji and himself, but Aoba makes her own [[instant noodles]].

Most of the varsity team are [[List of sports idioms#R|ringers]] recruited by new Head Coach Daimon from around the country, including [[Slugging percentage|power]] [[Batting (baseball)|hitter]] Yuhei Azuma, the boy from the batting center, and Daimon promises Shido that he will take the school to the national spotlight of Koshien within three years. When Aoba, now captain of the junior high school team, visits a high school team practice, she is surprised to see Ko playing baseball, and he tells her he was inspired by her pitching. In class, Azuma does not recognize Senda (who is on the varsity team) but does remember Ko from the batting center. Azuma tells Daimon that he only remembers faces of significant people, of which there are four on the team.

When Ko, Akaishi, and Nakanishi watch her pitch, Daimon tells them it does not matter if she pitches too much because, as a girl, she cannot play in a tournament game. When Azuma takes his turn at bat, he asks her to not hold back, and in response she insists that Akaishi be her catcher. Pitching her fastest, she almost [[Strikeout|strikes out]] Azuma. After Akaishi accuses Azuma of not being manly for deliberately [[List of baseball jargon (F)#foul off|fouling back]], Azuma hits a home run on the next pitch and Aoba collapses exhausted.

In the park, Momiji plays catch with an old man who is a regular at Akaishi's family's liquor store. Daimon tells Shido that an upcoming [[Exhibition game|scrimmage]] between varsity and prefab teams will demonstrate how much better the varsity players are. Because of a rumor that prefab players who perform well might be promoted to varsity, the third-year players train hard. Before the scrimmage, Ko has Aoba catch his pitches because he has never played in a real game and so has no comparison for his pitching. She calls them okay, which pleases him as the best compliment he can expect from her, and makes a bet that he will hold the varsity team to ten runs, which she changes to five runs after looking at her bruised hand.

In the [[Inning#Baseball|bottom]] of the inning, Ko quickly pitches [[Out (baseball)|out]] the first three batters, which Daimon attributes to luck but Azuma recognizes is based on Aoba's batting data and Ko's ability. After Senda gives up three runs in the top of the second inning, including home runs by Ko and Akaishi, Daimon kicks him off the varsity team and Maeno substitutes him in as [[shortstop]] for the prefab team. Ko pitches fastballs down the middle to Azuma, which Aoba calls foolish and Azuma hits for a home run. The prefab team quickly retires the rest of the side but has trouble hitting against the best varsity pitcher.

Daimon chews out [[center fielder]] Miki for strategically [[Bunt (baseball)|bunting]] against his orders to treat the scrimmage as a batting practice. At the bottom of the sixth, a tiring Ko tells catcher Akaishi that he can no longer pitch with both speed and control, and Akaishi has him go for speed. After Azuma hits another home run, Akaishi tells him the pitch was weak because this is Ko's first real game. When a third-year prefab player, Makihara, is thrown out while running for home, Senda tells him Daimon has no intention of promoting anyone to the varsity team because that would mean admitting he was wrong.

In the top of the ninth, the prefab team gets runners on first and second and Makihara advances them with a [[sacrifice bunt]]. Ko [[Run batted in|hits both runners in]] with a [[Single (baseball)|single]] to tie the game. While Ko is on base, Azuma criticizes his pitching, to which Ko says he did not expect Azuma could hit him.

The prefab team recruits Aoba for the scrimmage to replace a retired third-year player, and to convince her to play center field instead of pitcher, Akaishi has her bat against Ko. After watching the prefab team practice, Azuma deliberately injures himself to avoid playing in the scrimmage and tells Daimon to prove that he has enough other good players to take him to Koshien.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 16\n| Title               = How Should I Know?\n| TranslitTitle       = Shiru ka\n| NativeTitle         = \u77e5\u308b\u304b\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2009|7|19|df=y}}<ref name=\"airdates-ep14-26\"/>\n| ShortSummary        = Before the scrimmage Daimon tells Azuma that Shido will not fire him even if the varsity team loses, and Shido confirms this. However, during the first inning, Tubby's grandfather, who is the school's chairman, tells Shido and Daimon he is ratifying the wager with Maeno. During the first two innings, Ko allows the bases to get [[Bases loaded|loaded]] before striking out the next three batters, and to focus him, Akaishi tells Ko to pitch as if it were late in the game. In the sixth inning, the game still scoreless, Daimon asks Azuma who were the prefab team's opponents in their practice matches; Azuma says they played top teams from the [[Prefecture#Japanese sense of prefecture|prefectural]] tournament, and that Ko pitched easily the first six innings to give his team fielding practice. In the seventh inning, Aoba hits a single and then scores on Senda's [[sacrifice fly]]. During the final innings, Azuma asks Daimon if he wishes he had better hitters in his lineup, such as Miki, and as Ko strikes out the final three batters, Azuma says Ko is now the best pitcher they have played against all year. As the prefab team celebrates their win, Aoba silently tells Wakaba that Ko did it.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 17\n| Title               = That's Tough\n| TranslitTitle       = Shindoi na\n| NativeTitle         = \u30b7\u30f3\u30c9\u30a4\u306a\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2009|7|26|df=y}}<ref name=\"airdates-ep14-26\"/>\n| ShortSummary        = After the scrimmage, Shido and Daimon are fired and most of Daimon's varsity players follow him to another school.

Because Ko's stamina flags during the fall prefectural tournament, Azuma makes Ko begin jogging to school instead of taking the train. A boy asks Ko for an introduction to Aoba, and Ko congratulates him as the 100th person to do so. When Azuma asks Ko about a photograph of Wakaba, Ko admits that he was in love with her, and Azuma responds that \"you guys\" have it tough. To get the five most persistent boys to stop asking her out, Aoba goes on a date with all five at once. When Junpei asks about his pitching form, Ko is surprised but says that he based it on Aoba's. Aoba explains to Ko that Junpei's promising career as a pitcher was ended by an injury before he could go to Koshien, and that Yuhei is trying to reach Koshien in his place. Ko tells Aoba he is also serious about going to Koshien, to make Wakaba's last dream come true.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 18\n| Title               = An Audition?\n| TranslitTitle       = \u014cdishon?\n| NativeTitle         = \u30aa\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3?\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2009|8|2|df=y}}<ref name=\"airdates-ep14-26\"/>\n| ShortSummary        = Aoba's friends urge her to audition for the lead in a movie adaptation of ''[[Idol Ace]]'', but she declines.

When Aoba declines a batting rematch, Midori shows off her hitting in the Tsukishima cages, where she meets Risa practicing batting and coaches her. With continual practice Risa's pitching improves but, as Azuma puts it, only from kindergarten to first-grade level. After a week of Midori's pleading, Aoba agrees to pitch to her again. At the school baseball field, they meet Risa practicing at the last minute. Aoba strikes Midori out in three pitches, and after watching her form, Risa pitches a ball over the [[Home plate|plate]] for the first time. Risa gets the role of a spoiled team manager and resigns as Seishu's manager. Risa gives Aoba a gift in thanks, and says she's okay with a supporting role if it leads her to her goal of becoming famous.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 19\n| Title               = Memories ...\n| TranslitTitle       = Omoide no ...\n| NativeTitle         = \u601d\u3044\u51fa\u306e\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2009|8|9|df=y}}<ref name=\"airdates-ep14-26\"/>\n| ShortSummary        = For the first time since Wakaba's death, Ko goes with the Tsukishimas to visit to the sisters' maternal grandparents in the mountains, where they are caught in a snowstorm. While trapped in the house, he and Aoba remember his past visits and playing with Wakaba. Looking through a photo album, Ko recognizes Aoba's uncle, a famous [[Mountaineering|mountain climber]], but not his son, Mizuki, who is the same age as Aoba. In the morning, Ko goes into the snowy forest to visit the tree on which he and Wakaba carved their names, which Aoba had then scratched out. He gets lost and Aoba directs him to the tree, where he discovers that Aoba had later carved replacement names. Back home, at the start of spring, Ko and Nakanishi see a strange boy climb up a drain spout to retrieve a woman's hat blown there by the wind.

When Mizuki and Aoba reminisce about Wakaba, he tells her that Aoba is the one he loves. Mizuki belatedly recognizes Ko as Wakaba's boyfriend and wonders whether he throws a 100&nbsp;mph fastball yet. Momiji asks Aoba if she finds Mizuki attractive but she does not answer, and later Momiji remembers Ko and Wakaba playing with her and silently apologises to Wakaba. Several girls ask Mizuki out. He turns them down, claiming to be in love with Aoba, and tells some irate boys that the rumor that Aoba and Ko are going out is false. At practice, Ko tells Akaishi that Aoba is hiding a twisted ankle no one had noticed, and Aoba retaliates by revealing Ko is hiding a stiff left arm.

In the fourth inning, Aoba bats in two runners with a double. After Ozaki figures out Matsuyama's [[Catcher (baseball)#Calling the game|call]] patterns and Oka scores a fifth run, Aoba asks to give the signals instead.

When Mishama bats, later that inning, he hits a [[Home run#Grand slam|solo home run]] to tie the game at 1. At the top of the ninth, Senda hits a single, thus ensuring that the best hitters of both teams, Azuma and Mishima, will bat again.

Aoba tells Azuma she will try out for the women's national team in March, and when she teases him about being given [[Valentine's Day#Asia|chocolates]] for [[Valentine's Day]], he says the only girl he would consider going out with is her. For Valentine's Day, both Aoba and Azuma receive many chocolates. When Aoba drops Ko's chocolates off a bridge, she buys replacements, including one extra to give to Azuma for her. When Ko delivers it, Azuma says that he likes Aoba because she is hard to figure out, because she is not true to herself. That evening, Akane asks Ko to show her photographs of Wakaba. As she looks through his albums, she comments that it is obvious Wakaba loved him, and would still love him today.

At the tryouts, the Satomi players point out Shimano from Ryuo, who looks and plays like her cousin from the boys' team. In Tokyo, Ko waits out the rainy day in Akane's soba shop. During her batting tryout, Shimano is overshadowed by Oka's Ozaki. Kojima and Oka's Sawaguchi watch Aoba's pitching and are impressed by how her speed and control have improved. Before the coaches announce the results, Shimano insists on showing how she bats against a pitcher instead of a machine, and draws Aoba as her pitcher. Aoba strikes her out with three pitches, and Aoba, Matsuyama, and Midori all pass the first round of tryouts.

Midori is disappointed that Aoba cannot participate in the second round of tryouts, and is herself wait-listed for the national team. Junpei Azuma proposes marriage to Ichiyo, who says yes on one condition, which she does not name. To keep Aoba occupied in the hospital, Ko brings her a [[Baseball (ball)|ball]] and [[Baseball glove|glove]], after which a nurse says she looks more lively. Akaishi gives Akane two tickets his family cannot use and tells her to invite Ko to the performance.

Aoba tells Azuma that Ko's date with Akane is his first, then assumes the glove maintenance kit Ko sent her is from Azuma. After the play, Ko and Akane visit the neighborhood where she grew up. Ko later gives Akaishi kabuki-themed [[snack food]]. At the start of the school year, when Ko becomes a third-year student and Momiji enters junior high school, Aoba is discharged.

When Akane visits a [[flea market]] in another township, Aoba suggests that Ko accompany her, where in return for Aoba's coaching Ko buys her a garish T-shirt. Aoba tells Azuma that she does not regret not making the women's national team, then complains about how quickly Ko learns new pitches, saying that maybe she has underestimated him.

Is that fact, or fiction, or both? The historicity of this tradition is assumed by most, but the possibility that Mani\u2019s noble Arsacid background is legendary cannot be ruled out (cf. Scheftelowitz, 1933, pp. 403\u20134).

Among these medieval accounts, Ibn al-Nadim's account of Mani's life and teachings is generally speaking the most reliable and exhaustive. Notably, the (in other accounts prominent) image of the \"Third Ambassador\" is only represented through a brief mention of the name ''ba\u0161\u012br'', \"messenger of good news\", and the topos of \"Mani the Painter\" (which in other Islamic accounts almost completely replaces that of \"the founder of a religion\") is completely absent.<ref>W.

At ages 12 and 24, however, Mani had visionary experiences of a \"heavenly twin\" of his (''syzygos''), calling him to leave his father's Baptist sect and preach the true message of Jesus in a new gospel.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wearring|first=Andrew|date=2008-09-19|title=Manichaean Studies in the 21st Century|url=https://openjournals.library.sydney.edu.au/index.php/SSR/article/view/254|journal=Sydney Studies in Religion|language=en|volume=0|issn=1444-5158}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Henrichs|first=Albert|date=1979|title=The Cologne Mani Codex Reconsidered|journal=Harvard Studies in Classical Philology|volume=83|pages=339\u2013367|doi=10.2307/311105|issn=0073-0688|jstor=311105}}</ref> Mani then travelled to India (now the [[Sakhas]] in [[Afghanistan]]), where he studied [[Hinduism]] and its various extant philosophies, including [[Buddhism]].<ref name=Iranica/> [[Al-Biruni]] says Mani only traveled to India after being banished from Persia,<ref>{{cite book|author=Al-Biruni(translator:Edward Sachau)|title=Al Beruni's India| year=1910|location=London}}</ref> but this might be an error or a second journey.<ref name=Iranica/> It is believed that his Christian roots might have been influenced by [[Marcion]] and [[Bardaisan]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Dimitri Obolensky|title=The Bogomils: A Study in Balkan Neo-Manichaeism| year=2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521607636}}</ref>\n\nReturning in 242, Mani presented himself to [[Shapur I]], to whom he dedicated his only work written in Persian, known as the ''[[Shabuhragan]]''.

His corpse was decapitated and the head placed on a spike. Bahram also ordered the killing of many Manichaeans.<ref>{{cite book|author=Al-Biruni|title=The Chronology of Ancient Nations}}</ref>\n\n==Works==\nThe canon of Mani included six works originally written in Syriac, and one in [[Middle Persian|Persian]], the ''[[Shabuhragan|Shapuragan]]''. While none of his books have survived in complete form, there are numerous fragments and quotations of them, including a long Syriac quotation from one of his works, as well as a large amount of material in Middle Persian, Coptic, and numerous other languages.  Examples of surviving portions of his works include:  the ''Shabuhragan'' (Middle Persian), the ''[[Book of Giants]]'' (numerous fragments in many languages), the ''[[Fundamental Epistle]]'' (quoted in length by Saint Augustine), a number of fragments of his ''[[Gospel of Mani|Living Gospel]]'' (or'' Great Gospel''), a Syriac excerpt quoted by [[Theodore Bar Konai]], and his ''Letter to Edessa''  contained in the  ''[[Cologne Mani-Codex]]''. Mani also wrote the book ''[[Arzhang]]'', a holy book of Manichaeism unique in that it contained many drawings and paintings to express and explain the Manichaeist creation and history of the world.\n\n==Teaching==\n{{main|Manichaeism}}\n[[File:Mani's Community Established (Detail 1).jpg|thumb|270px|Detail of ''Mani's Community Established'', depicting seven lay people bring offerings to shrine with statue of Mani and three elects.]]\nMani's teaching was intended to succeed and surpass the teachings of [[Christianity]], [[Zoroastrianism]] and [[Buddhism]]. It is based on a rigid [[Dualistic cosmology|dualism]] of [[good and evil]], locked in eternal struggle.\n\nIn his mid-twenties, Mani decided that salvation was possible through education, self-denial, fasting and chastity. According to [[Al-Biruni]], a 10th-century muslim scholar, Mani claimed to be the ''[[Paraclete]]'' promised in the [[New Testament]], and the [[Last Prophet]].<ref>[[Al-Biruni|al-Biruni, Muhammad ibn Ahmad]]; [[Eduard Sachau]] ed.; ''[[The Remaining Signs of Past Centuries|The Chronology of Ancient Nations]]''; [https://archive.org/stream/chronologyofanci00biru#page/190/mode/1up p.  190]; W.

Ort|first=|publisher=|year=1967|isbn=|location=|pages=124|quote=Unfortunately the text breaks off after the comig of Mani is mentioned [...] we cannot say if this contained a pronouncement about the final character of Mani's appearance}}</ref>\n\nWhile his religion was not strictly a movement of Christian [[Gnosticism]] in the earlier mode, Mani did declare himself to be an \"apostle of Jesus Christ\", and extant Manichaean poetry frequently extols [[Jesus]] and his mother, [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]], with the highest reverence. Manichaean tradition is also noted to have claimed that Mani was the reincarnation of different religious figures including [[Zoroaster]], the [[Siddartha Gautama|historical Buddha]], as well as  Jesus.\n\nMani's followers were organized in a church structure, divided into a class of \"elects\" (''electi'') and \"auditors\" (''auditores''). Only the ''electi'' are required to follow the laws strictly, while the ''auditores'' care for them, hoping to become ''electi'' in their turn after [[reincarnation]].\n\n==Christian and Islamic tradition==\n===Late Antique Christian accounts in the West===\n{{Original Research|section|date=January 2019}}\nThe Western Christian tradition of Mani is based on [[Socrates of Constantinople]], a historian writing in the 5th century. According to this account, one Scythianos, a Saracen, husband of an Egyptian woman, \"introduced the doctrine of [[Empedocles]] and [[Pythagoras]] into Christianity\"; that he had a disciple, \"Buddas, formerly named Terebinthus,\" who travelled in Persia, where he alleged that he had been [[Miraculous births|born of a virgin]], and afterwards wrote four books, one of Mysteries, a second The Gospel, a third The Treasure, and a fourth Heads. While performing some mystic rites, he was hurled down a precipice by a [[Daemon (classical mythology)|daimon]], and killed. A woman at whose house he lodged buried him, took over his property, and bought a boy of seven, named Cubricus. This boy she freed and educated, leaving him the property and books of Buddas-Terebinthus. Cubricus then travelled into Persia, where he took the name of Manes and gave forth the doctrines of Buddas Terebinthus as his own. The king of Persia, hearing that he worked miracles, sent for him to heal his sick son, and on the child's dying put Manes in prison. Thence he escaped, flying into Mesopotamia, but was traced, captured, and flayed alive by the Persian king's orders, the skin being then stuffed with chaff and hung up before the gate of the city.\n\nAccording to [[Jerome]], Archelaus wrote his account of his disputation with \"Manich\u00e6us\" in Syriac, whence it was translated into Greek. The Greek is lost, and the work, apart from extracts, subsists only in a Latin translation from the Greek, of doubtful age and fidelity,   probably made after the 5th century. By [[Photios I of Constantinople|Photius]] it is stated that Heraclean, [[bishop of Chalcedon]], in his book against the Manich\u00e6ans, said the  ''Disputation of Archelaus'' was written by one Hegemonius, an author not otherwise traceable, and of unknown date.\n\nIn the Latin narrative, \"Manes\" is said to have come, after his flight from court, from Arabion, a frontier fortress, to Caschar or Carchar, a town said to be in [[Roman Mesopotamia]], in the hope of converting an eminent Christian there, named Marcellus, to whom he had sent a letter beginning: \"Manich\u00e6us apostle of Jesus Christ, and all the saints and virgins with me, send peace to Marcellus.\" In his train he brought twenty-two (or twelve) youths and virgins. At the request of Marcellus, he debated on religion with bishop Archelaus, by whom he was vanquished; whereupon he set out to return to Persia. On his way he proposed to debate with a priest at the town of Diodorides; but Archelaus came to take the priest's place, and again defeated him; whereupon, fearing to be given up to the Persians by the Christians, he returned to Arabion.\n\nAt this stage Archelaus introduces in a discourse to the people his history of \"this Manes,\" very much to the effect of the recapitulation in Socrates. Among the further details are these: that Scythianus lived \"in the time of the Apostles\";  that Terebinthus said the name of Buddas had been imposed on him; that in the mountains he had been brought up by an angel; that he had been convicted of imposture by a Persian prophet named Parcus, and by Labdacus, son of [[Mithra]];   that in the disputation he taught concerning the sphere, the two luminaries, the transmigration of souls, and the war of the ''Principia'' against God;   that \"Corbicius\" or Corbicus, about the age of sixty, translated the books of Terebinthus;  that he made three chief disciples, Thomas, Addas, and Hermas, of whom he sent the first to Egypt, and the second to Scythia, keeping the third with him;  that the two former returned when he was in prison, and that he sent them to procure for him the books of the Christians, which he then studied.

He was persecuted by [[Shapur I]] and fled to [[Central Asia]], where he made disciples and embellished with paintings a ''Tchighil'' (or ''picturarum domus Chinensis'') and another temple called ''Ghalbita''. Provisioning in advance a cave which had a spring, he told his disciples he was going to heaven, and would not return for a year, after which time they were to seek him in the cave in question. They then came back there after a year and found him, whereupon he showed them an illustrated book, called ''Ergenk'', or ''Estenk'' [[Arzhang]], which he said he had brought from heaven: whereafter he had many followers, with whom he returned to Persia at the death of Shapur. \nThe new king, Hormisdas, joined and protected the sect; and built Mani a castle. The next king, Bahram or Varanes, at first favoured Mani; but, after getting him to debate with certain Zoroastrian teachers, caused him to be flayed alive, and the skin to be stuffed and hung up. Thereupon most of his followers fled to India and China.<ref>John M. Robertson, ''[[Pagan Christs]]'' (2nd ed. 1911), [http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/cv/pch/pch59.htm \u00a7 14.

Among these medieval accounts, Ibn al-Nadim's account of Mani's life and teachings is generally speaking the most reliable and exhaustive.

His corpse was decapitated and the head placed on a spike. Bahram also ordered the killing of many Manichaeans.<ref>{{cite book|author=Al-Biruni|title=The Chronology of Ancient Nations}}</ref>\n\n==Works==\nThe canon of Mani included six works originally written in Syriac, and one in [[Middle Persian|Persian]], the ''[[Shabuhragan|Shapuragan]]''. While none of his books have survived in complete form, there are numerous fragments and quotations of them, including a long Syriac quotation from one of his works, as well as a large amount of material in Middle Persian, Coptic, and numerous other languages.  Examples of surviving portions of his works include:  the ''Shabuhragan'' (Middle Persian), the ''[[Book of Giants]]'' (numerous fragments in many languages), the ''[[Fundamental Epistle]]'' (quoted in length by Saint Augustine), a number of fragments of his ''[[Gospel of Mani|Living Gospel]]'' (or'' Great Gospel''), a Syriac excerpt quoted by [[Theodore Bar Konai]], and his ''Letter to Edessa''  contained in the  ''[[Cologne Mani-Codex]]''. Mani also wrote the book ''[[Arzhang]]'', a holy book of Manichaeism unique in that it contained many drawings and paintings to express and explain the Manichaeist creation and history of the world.\n\n==Teaching==\n{{main|Manichaeism}}\n[[File:Mani's Community Established (Detail 1).jpg|thumb|270px|Detail of ''Mani's Community Established'', depicting seven lay people bring offerings to shrine with statue of Mani and three elects.]]\nMani's teaching was intended to succeed and surpass the teachings of [[Christianity]], [[Zoroastrianism]] and [[Buddhism]]. It is based on a rigid [[Dualistic cosmology|dualism]] of [[good and evil]], locked in eternal struggle.\n\nIn his mid-twenties, Mani decided that salvation was possible through education, self-denial, fasting and chastity. According to [[Al-Biruni]], a 10th-century muslim scholar, Mani claimed to be the ''[[Paraclete]]'' promised in the [[New Testament]], and the [[Last Prophet]].<ref>[[Al-Biruni|al-Biruni, Muhammad ibn Ahmad]]; [[Eduard Sachau]] ed.; ''[[The Remaining Signs of Past Centuries|The Chronology of Ancient Nations]]''; [https://archive.org/stream/chronologyofanci00biru#page/190/mode/1up p.  190]; W.

Manichaean tradition is also noted to have claimed that Mani was the reincarnation of different religious figures including [[Zoroaster]], the [[Siddartha Gautama|historical Buddha]], as well as  Jesus.\n\nMani's followers were organized in a church structure, divided into a class of \"elects\" (''electi'') and \"auditors\" (''auditores''). Only the ''electi'' are required to follow the laws strictly, while the ''auditores'' care for them, hoping to become ''electi'' in their turn after [[reincarnation]].\n\n==Christian and Islamic tradition==\n===Late Antique Christian accounts in the West===\n{{Original Research|section|date=January 2019}}\nThe Western Christian tradition of Mani is based on [[Socrates of Constantinople]], a historian writing in the 5th century. According to this account, one Scythianos, a Saracen, husband of an Egyptian woman, \"introduced the doctrine of [[Empedocles]] and [[Pythagoras]] into Christianity\"; that he had a disciple, \"Buddas, formerly named Terebinthus,\" who travelled in Persia, where he alleged that he had been [[Miraculous births|born of a virgin]], and afterwards wrote four books, one of Mysteries, a second The Gospel, a third The Treasure, and a fourth Heads. While performing some mystic rites, he was hurled down a precipice by a [[Daemon (classical mythology)|daimon]], and killed. A woman at whose house he lodged buried him, took over his property, and bought a boy of seven, named Cubricus. This boy she freed and educated, leaving him the property and books of Buddas-Terebinthus. Cubricus then travelled into Persia, where he took the name of Manes and gave forth the doctrines of Buddas Terebinthus as his own. The king of Persia, hearing that he worked miracles, sent for him to heal his sick son, and on the child's dying put Manes in prison. Thence he escaped, flying into Mesopotamia, but was traced, captured, and flayed alive by the Persian king's orders, the skin being then stuffed with chaff and hung up before the gate of the city.\n\nAccording to [[Jerome]], Archelaus wrote his account of his disputation with \"Manich\u00e6us\" in Syriac, whence it was translated into Greek. The Greek is lost, and the work, apart from extracts, subsists only in a Latin translation from the Greek, of doubtful age and fidelity,   probably made after the 5th century. By [[Photios I of Constantinople|Photius]] it is stated that Heraclean, [[bishop of Chalcedon]], in his book against the Manich\u00e6ans, said the  ''Disputation of Archelaus'' was written by one Hegemonius, an author not otherwise traceable, and of unknown date.\n\nIn the Latin narrative, \"Manes\" is said to have come, after his flight from court, from Arabion, a frontier fortress, to Caschar or Carchar, a town said to be in [[Roman Mesopotamia]], in the hope of converting an eminent Christian there, named Marcellus, to whom he had sent a letter beginning: \"Manich\u00e6us apostle of Jesus Christ, and all the saints and virgins with me, send peace to Marcellus.\" In his train he brought twenty-two (or twelve) youths and virgins. At the request of Marcellus, he debated on religion with bishop Archelaus, by whom he was vanquished; whereupon he set out to return to Persia. On his way he proposed to debate with a priest at the town of Diodorides; but Archelaus came to take the priest's place, and again defeated him; whereupon, fearing to be given up to the Persians by the Christians, he returned to Arabion.\n\nAt this stage Archelaus introduces in a discourse to the people his history of \"this Manes,\" very much to the effect of the recapitulation in Socrates. Among the further details are these: that Scythianus lived \"in the time of the Apostles\";  that Terebinthus said the name of Buddas had been imposed on him; that in the mountains he had been brought up by an angel; that he had been convicted of imposture by a Persian prophet named Parcus, and by Labdacus, son of [[Mithra]];   that in the disputation he taught concerning the sphere, the two luminaries, the transmigration of souls, and the war of the ''Principia'' against God;   that \"Corbicius\" or Corbicus, about the age of sixty, translated the books of Terebinthus;  that he made three chief disciples, Thomas, Addas, and Hermas, of whom he sent the first to Egypt, and the second to Scythia, keeping the third with him;  that the two former returned when he was in prison, and that he sent them to procure for him the books of the Christians, which he then studied. According to the Latin narrative, finally, Manes on his return to Arabion was seized and taken to the Persian king, by whose orders he was flayed, his body being left to the birds, and his skin, filled with air, hung at the city gate.<ref>\n\nJohn M.

He was persecuted by [[Shapur I]] and fled to [[Central Asia]], where he made disciples and embellished with paintings a ''Tchighil'' (or ''picturarum domus Chinensis'') and another temple called ''Ghalbita''. Provisioning in advance a cave which had a spring, he told his disciples he was going to heaven, and would not return for a year, after which time they were to seek him in the cave in question. They then came back there after a year and found him, whereupon he showed them an illustrated book, called ''Ergenk'', or ''Estenk'' [[Arzhang]], which he said he had brought from heaven: whereafter he had many followers, with whom he returned to Persia at the death of Shapur. \nThe new king, Hormisdas, joined and protected the sect; and built Mani a castle. The next king, Bahram or Varanes, at first favoured Mani; but, after getting him to debate with certain Zoroastrian teachers, caused him to be flayed alive, and the skin to be stuffed and hung up. Thereupon most of his followers fled to India and China.<ref>John M. Robertson, ''[[Pagan Christs]]'' (2nd ed. 1911), [http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/cv/pch/pch59.htm \u00a7 14.
