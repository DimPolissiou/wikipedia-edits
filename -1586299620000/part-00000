It was released in 2003 for the MVS arcade platform, is the fifth game in the [[Metal Slug (series)|Metal Slug series]], and was one of the last games for the Neo Geo system. The game was developed by [[Noise Factory]]/[[SNK Playmore]], after Korean company [[Mega Enterprise]] had directed ''[[Metal Slug 4]]''.\n\nThe biggest difference from previous titles is the addition of the slide move, which allows the player to evade and maneuver in a new fashion. Unlike its predecessor ''[[Metal Slug 4]]'', which reused many of the backgrounds from the previous games, ''Metal Slug 5'' incorporates a wealth of new environments and backgrounds and features a more [[heavy metal music|Heavy metal]] influenced soundtrack.\n\nIt was later ported to [[Xbox (console)|Microsoft Xbox]] in Japan and North America only (not compatible with [[Xbox 360]]) and [[PlayStation 2|Sony PlayStation 2]] as a stand-alone game in Japan and Europe, and along with ''Metal Slug 4'' as a [[compilation (games)|compilation]] in North America and South Korea. It was also ported to [[Microsoft Windows]] for a Korean release. A port was also released on [[Nintendo Switch]] in 2018.\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:NEOGEO Metal Slug 5.png|thumb|left|Gameplay screenshot showcasing the first boss.]]\nOne year after the event of [[Metal Slug 7]]. A special disc that contains deep and intricate secrets about the Metal Slug project is stolen by a mysterious group called the Ptolemaic Army, whose speciality lies from within archaeological excavation and espionage. Marco and Tarma of the Peregrine Falcon Strike Force follow in hot pursuit against the group and in the process are joined by Eri and Fio of SPARROWS. Together once more, the quartet investigate the shrouded objective of the Ptolemaic Army, who over time grows more powerful as they are joined by a mysterious masked man and his followers. At the end of the game, the Ptolemaic Army summons a giant demon as the final boss, which after a long battle is forced to leave Earth thanks to the heroes.\n\n{{clr}}\n\n==Differences from previous games==\n*The player may now perform a slide-dash.\n*\"[[Obesity|Fat]] mode\" is the only remaining modifier, there are no zombies, mummies, aliens or other supernatural creatures, although the final boss is a large demon.\n*Morden's infantry, Morden himself and Allen O'Neil are nowhere to be found in this game; rather, one fights armies of veiled terrorists, special forces, and assorted mecha. As a result, this game lacks much of the sense of humor of its predecessors. However, most of the new enemies are mostly edits of Rebel soldier sprites.\n*With the exception of the first and third levels, the game does not have branching paths.\n*The \"Flame Shot\" has been omitted. According to the Debug level, the Flame Shot is present in the code.\n*The medal system from Metal Slug 4 has been abandoned.\n*Playable characters Trevor and Nadia have been omitted in favor of Eri and Tarma.\n*There are cutscenes at various points throughout the game, rather than one or two at the end, giving the game a hint of progression of plot.\n*A remixed version of \"Final Attack\" is played whilst facing the final boss.\n*Depending on whether the Arcade machine has the \"Blood\" option turned on or off, not only the blood color will change from red to white, but the Ptolemaic Army's guerilla's T-shirt and bandanas will change from red to navy.\n\n==New vehicles and Slugs==\nOnly three new vehicles were added, though the Metal Slug, Slug Mariner, and Slug Flyer make a return.\n*The first new vehicle, the Slug Gunner, is the ultimate evolution of the Metal Slug and rebel Armor. The Gunner fires a machine gun, a chassis-mounted cannon, and can punch enemies with a close-combat exploding metal spike \"cannon\". The Gunner can perform a mid-air jump like that of the Level Armor. The Gunner can transform from a walker into a tank, and can move slightly faster in addition to running over [[infantry]]. However, the gunner is slow, takes a while to turn, and only has a 180-degree firing arc (360-degree while in the air).\n*The second new vehicle is the Car Slug or the TIAF 660. This is a car with a 360-degree vulcan  cannon attached. Its secondary fire is an oversized Enemy Chaser. Of particular interest is that the player cannot eject from the vehicle, meaning they die when its destroyed, and will subsequently respawn in a new Car Slug.\n*The Augensterm is a giant squid-like walker with two legs tethered to the floor and to the ceiling; jumping raises or lowers the cockpit. The Augensterm is armed with 360-degree firing vulcan cannons, and a [[harpoon]] gun.\n\n==Reception==\n{{Empty section|date=December 2014}}\n{{Video game reviews\n|MC = 71 <ref>http://www.metacritic.com/game/xbox/metal-slug-4-5</ref><ref>http://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-2/metal-slug-4-5</ref>\n|GR = 70.89%/70.47%<ref>http://www.gamerankings.com/xbox/920516-metal-slug-4-and-5/index.html</ref><ref>http://www.gamerankings.com/ps2/920446-metal-slug-4-and-5/index.html</ref>\n}}\n\n''Metal Slug 5'' received mixed to positive reviews from critics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-2/metal-slug-4-5 |title=Metal Slug 4 & 5 for PlayStation 2 Reviews |publisher=Metacritic |date= |accessdate=2013-11-05}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/metal-slug-4-and-5-review/1900-6124487/ |title=Metal Slug 4 & 5 Review |publisher=GameSpot |date= |accessdate=2013-11-05}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Martin |first=Matt |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/r_metalslug5_ps2 |title=Metal Slug 5 Review \u2022 Reviews \u2022 PlayStation 2 \u2022 |publisher=Eurogamer.net |date=2006-03-13 |accessdate=2013-11-05}}</ref> It received very positive scores from players, with an average of 8.1 on GameSpot for the PS2 version and 8.4 for the Arcade version.

In the early 1900s, the Sai Kung market had expanded into 50 shops, plus 4 boat building sheds. At the same time, a smaller market of 18 shops was existed in [[Hang Hau]].<ref name=Faure/> (Hang Hau became part of the built-up area of [[Tseung Kwan O New Town]], and not part of Sai Kung Town)\n\nIt was not an education centre of Sai Kung Peninsula at that time, as traditional study halls were located inside their own villages. However, the [[Catholic Church of Hong Kong]] had established a primary school at the end of 19th century, which teach western curriculum in the market town.<ref name=Faure/> The colonial British government also established a police station and a dispensary near the market town.<ref name=Faure/>\n\nDuring the [[World War I]], ships were required to be inspected by the Royal Navy when entering or leaving the [[Victoria Harbour, Hong Kong|Victoria Harbour]]. The [[Port Shelter]] and the Sai Kung market town were located outside the harbour, thus benefited from the policy to become a place for resupply.<ref name=Faure/> Another temple inside the market town, also became the local civic centre that settle disputes.<ref name=Faure/> The shop owners, which were not from the surrounding villages, even represented Sai Kung in [[Heung Yee Kuk]] in the 1920s. Heung Yee Kuk represented the interests of the rural villages of the New Territories and recognized by the colonial government as a consulting institution. However, in the 1930s, the local merchants formed their own chamber of commence and gradually took over the political influence on the market town.<ref name=Faure/> Nowadays however, the seat for the [[Sai Kung Central (constituency)|Sai Kung Central constituency]] is elected by the local residents of the town as universal suffrage. The rural villages surrounding the town, still elect representatives to Heung Yee Kuk, however.\n\nAccording to another author, the Sai Kung market town received the economic expansion in the 1950s. At the time, the world was enforcing an embargo policy to the newly established the [[People's Republic of China]], which the market town became a place for smuggling goods to the Republic.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=dnFODwAAQBAJ|script-title=zh:\u6a02\u904a\u65b0\u754c\u6771\u8857\u5e02|page=29|author1=\u723e\u6771|author2=\u4f55\u6cf3\u5100|author3=\u4f55\u5c55\u9d6c|script-chapter=zh:\u897f\u8ca2\u5340|trans-chapter=Sai Kung District|language=zh-hk|location=Hong Kong|publisher=Ming Pao Publications|ISBN=978-988-8444-43-4|date=June 2017}}</ref>\n\nSai Kung town underwent significant expansion during the 1970s when the High Island Reservoir and associated water schemes required some villagers and fishermen to be rehoused in Sai Kung. This provided a core of government-funded new development, both housing and commercial, in the town centre. This was followed by the Tui Min Hoi (literally 'over the harbour') development under the government's market town programme.{{fact|date=November 2012}}\n\nBefore the relocation of the [[Hong Kong International Airport|airport of Hong Kong]] from [[Kai Tak Airport|Kai Tak]] to [[Chek Lap Kok]], the town was a popular residential area for airport staff from all over the world.{{fact|date=November 2012}}\n\nThe town is next to [[Sai Kung Hoi]], which was a fishing harbour. The harbour is now a typhoon shelter, where motorized junks used in the local tourist trade are moored.

The word {{zh|t=\u5e02|labels=no}} was also used by the colonial British government to transliterate the word Town, such as [[Tai Po New Town|Tai Po Town]].\n\nThe town is named after Sai Kung ({{zh|t=\u897f\u8ca2}}).

In the early 1900s, the market had expanded into 50 shops, plus 4 boat building sheds. At the same time, a smaller market of 18 shops was existed in [[Hang Hau]].<ref name=Faure/> (Hang Hau became part of the built-up area of [[Tseung Kwan O New Town]], and not part of Sai Kung Town)\n\nIt was not an education centre of Sai Kung Peninsula at that time, as traditional study halls were located inside their own villages. However, the [[Catholic Church of Hong Kong]] had established a primary school at the end of 19th century, which teach western curriculum in the market town.<ref name=Faure/> The colonial British government also established a police station and a dispensary near the market town.<ref name=Faure/>\n\nDuring the [[World War I]], ships were required to be inspected by the Royal Navy when entering or leaving the [[Victoria Harbour, Hong Kong|Victoria Harbour]]. The [[Port Shelter]] and the Sai Kung market town were located outside the harbour, thus benefited from the policy to become a place for resupply.<ref name=Faure/> Another temple inside the market town, also became the local civic centre that settle disputes.<ref name=Faure/> The shop owners, which were not from the surrounding villages, even represented Sai Kung in [[Heung Yee Kuk]] in the 1920s. Heung Yee Kuk represented the interests of the rural villages of the New Territories and recognized by the colonial government as a consulting institution. However, in the 1930s, the local merchants formed their own chamber of commence and gradually took over the political influence on the market town.<ref name=Faure/> Nowadays however, the seat for the [[Sai Kung Central (constituency)|Sai Kung Central constituency]] is elected by the local residents of the town as universal suffrage. The rural villages surrounding the town, still elect representatives to Heung Yee Kuk, however.\n\nAccording to another author, the Sai Kung market town received the economic expansion in the 1950s. At the time, the world was enforcing an embargo policy to the newly established the [[People's Republic of China]], which the market town became a place for smuggling goods to the Republic.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=dnFODwAAQBAJ|script-title=zh:\u6a02\u904a\u65b0\u754c\u6771\u8857\u5e02|page=29|author1=\u723e\u6771|author2=\u4f55\u6cf3\u5100|author3=\u4f55\u5c55\u9d6c|script-chapter=zh:\u897f\u8ca2\u5340|trans-chapter=Sai Kung District|language=zh-hk|location=Hong Kong|publisher=Ming Pao Publications|ISBN=978-988-8444-43-4|date=June 2017}}</ref>\n\nSai Kung town underwent significant expansion during the 1970s when the High Island Reservoir and associated water schemes required some villagers and fishermen to be rehoused in Sai Kung. This provided a core of government-funded new development, both housing and commercial, in the town centre. This was followed by the Tui Min Hoi (literally 'over the harbour') development under the government's market town programme.{{fact|date=November 2012}}\n\nBefore the relocation of the [[Hong Kong International Airport|airport of Hong Kong]] from [[Kai Tak Airport|Kai Tak]] to [[Chek Lap Kok]], the town was a popular residential area for airport staff from all over the world.{{fact|date=November 2012}}\n\nThe town is next to [[Sai Kung Hoi]], which was a fishing harbour. The harbour is now a typhoon shelter, where motorized junks used in the local tourist trade are moored. They are boats that can be hired for fishing and swimming trips.\n\n==Boundaries==\nThe statutory boundaries of the town were Hiram's Highway, Po Tung Road and Tai Mong Tsai Road in the north and west.

After Roosevelt took office in 1933, New Deal legislation sailed through Congress and the economy moved sharply upward from its nadir in early 1933. However, long-term unemployment remained a drag until 1940. In the 1934 midterm elections, 10 Republican senators went down to defeat, leaving the GOP with only 25 senators against 71 Democrats.

Republicans, mainly at the state level, argue that the restrictions (such as purging voter rolls, limiting voting locations and prosecuting double voting) are vital to prevent [[voter fraud]], claiming that voter fraud is an underestimated issue in elections. However, research has indicated that voter fraud is very uncommon, as civil and voting rights organizations often accuse Republicans of enacting restrictions to influence elections in the party's favor. Many laws or regulations restricting voting enacted by Republicans have been successfully challenged in court, with court rulings striking down such regulations and accusing Republicans of

They argue that Gingrich instilled a \"combative\" approach in the Republican Party, where hateful language and hyper-partisanship became commonplace, and where democratic norms were abandoned. Gingrich frequently questioned the [[patriotism]] of Democrats, called them corrupt, compared them to fascists, and accused them of wanting to destroy the United States. Gingrich was also involved in several major government shutdowns.<ref name=\"How Democracies Die\" /><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/145916/democracy-dies-donald-trump-contempt-for-american-political-institutions|title=How a Democracy Dies|work=The New Republic|access-date=2018-04-12|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181211105538/https://newrepublic.com/article/145916/democracy-dies-donald-trump-contempt-for-american-political-institutions|archive-date=December 11, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2018/01/22/579670528/how-democracies-die-authors-say-trump-is-a-symptom-of-deeper-problems|title='How Democracies Die' Authors Say Trump Is A Symptom Of 'Deeper Problems'|work=NPR.org|access-date=2018-04-12|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181208011203/https://www.npr.org/2018/01/22/579670528/how-democracies-die-authors-say-trump-is-a-symptom-of-deeper-problems|archive-date=December 8, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2018/01/the-rising-pressures-on-american-democracy/|title=The rising pressures on American democracy|date=2018-01-29|work=Harvard Gazette|access-date=2018-04-12|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181130201624/https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2018/01/the-rising-pressures-on-american-democracy/|archive-date=November 30, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nScholars have also characterized Mitch McConnell's tenure as Senate Minority Leader and Senate Majority Leader during the Obama presidency as one where obstructionism reached all-time highs.<ref name=\"The Senate Syndrome: The Evolution of Procedural Warfare in the Modern U.S. Senate\">{{Cite book|title=The Senate Syndrome: The Evolution of Procedural Warfare in the Modern U.S. Senate|last=Smith|first=Steven|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|year=2014|isbn=|location=|page=287}}</ref> Political scientists have referred to McConnell's use of the filibuster as \"constitutional hardball\", referring to the misuse of procedural tools in a way that undermines democracy.<ref name=\"Glassman 2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2018/12/11/wisconsins-and-michigans-legislatures-are-trying-to-weaken-incoming-governors-should-you-be-worried/|title=Republicans in Wisconsin and Michigan want to weaken incoming Democratic governors.

The Republicans had strong support from [[Pietism|pietistic]] Protestants, but they resisted demands for [[Prohibition]]. As the Northern postwar economy boomed with heavy and light industry, railroads, mines, fast-growing cities, and prosperous agriculture, the Republicans took credit and promoted policies to sustain the fast growth.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nThe GOP was usually dominant over the Democrats during the Third Party System (1850s\u20131890s). However, by 1890 the Republicans had agreed to the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]] and the [[Interstate Commerce Commission]] in response to complaints from owners of small businesses and farmers. The high [[McKinley Tariff]] of 1890 hurt the party and the Democrats swept to a landslide in the off-year elections, even defeating McKinley himself.

Roosevelt controlled American politics for most of the next three decades, excepting the two-term presidency of Republican [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]. Blacks moved into the Democratic Party during the [[New Deal]] era. After Roosevelt took office in 1933, New Deal legislation sailed through Congress and the economy moved sharply upward from its nadir in early 1933. However, long-term unemployment remained a drag until 1940. In the 1934 midterm elections, 10 Republican senators went down to defeat, leaving the GOP with only 25 senators against 71 Democrats. The House of Representatives likewise had overwhelming Democratic majorities.<ref>Lewis Gould, ''Grand Old Party: A History of the Republicans '' (2003) pp 271-308.</ref>\n\nThe Republican Party factionalized into a majority \"Old Right\" (based in the Midwest) and a liberal wing based in the Northeast that supported much of the New Deal. The Old Right sharply attacked the \"Second New Deal\" and said it represented class warfare and socialism. Roosevelt was re-elected in a landslide in 1936; however, as his second term began, the economy declined, strikes soared, and he failed to take control of the Supreme Court or to purge the Southern conservatives from the Democratic Party. Republicans made a major comeback in the [[United States House of Representatives elections, 1938|1938 elections]] and had new rising stars such as [[Robert A.

Anti-collectivist, anti-Communist, anti-New Deal, passionately committed to limited government, free market economics, and congressional (as opposed to executive) prerogatives, the G.O.P. conservatives were obliged from the start to wage a constant two-front war: against liberal Democrats from without and \"me-too\" Republicans from within.<ref>Quote on p. 261 {{cite journal |jstor = 2702450|title = The Republican Right from Taft to Reagan|last1 = Nash|first1 = George H.|last2 = Reinhard|first2 = David W.|journal = Reviews in American History|volume = 12|issue = 2|pages = 261\u2013265|year = 1984|doi = 10.2307/2702450}} Nash references David W.

However, research has indicated that voter fraud is very uncommon, as civil and voting rights organizations often accuse Republicans of enacting restrictions to influence elections in the party's favor.

They argue that Gingrich instilled a \"combative\" approach in the Republican Party, where hateful language and hyper-partisanship became commonplace, and where democratic norms were abandoned. Gingrich frequently questioned the [[patriotism]] of Democrats, called them corrupt, compared them to fascists, and accused them of wanting to destroy the United States.
