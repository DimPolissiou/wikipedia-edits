Inspired by the [[Ne\u1e6dunalv\u0101\u1e6dai|poem]] written by Nakkeerar in Sangam literature, the film, as the title suggest, is about the pain of separation \u2014 of a man and woman, and a grandfather and his grandson.<ref name=\"Subbaraj\">{{cite web|url=https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/of-love-and-longing/article25909333.ece|title='Had there not been a Karthik Subbaraj, producers would not have encouraged short filmmakers'|work=The Hindu|accessdate=4 January 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"Separation\">{{cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/tamil/movies/news/nedunalvaadai-is-a-film-on-the-pain-of-separation/articleshow/67436885.cms|title='Nedunalvaadai' is a film on the pain of separation|work=Times Of India|accessdate=9 January 2019}}</ref>\n\nThis film features ''Poo'' Ram and [[Mime Gopi]] in the lead role along with Elvis Alexander, Anjali Nair, and other actors. Lyricist [[Vairamuthu]] got impressed with the intense script and wrote lyrics for all the tracks, which is a big plus for this film.\n\n== Plot ==\nChellaiah (Poo Ram) is a simple farmer. He cares so much for the family. He has a son named Kombaiah ([[Mime Gopi]]) and a daughter named Pechiamma ([[Senthi Kumari|Senthikumari]]), who elopes to marry the love of her life, but he is a drunkard and does not care about his family. Unfortunately, Pechiamma left her husband, and she faces challenges to carry on with living with a son named Elango (Elvis Alexander), as well as a daughter, so she returns to her father. Chellaiah, though unhappy about her act of eloping, takes her family in and starts to support them. However, Kombaiah does not like this. Chellaiah loves and supports his daughter's family and takes care of the education of the grandchildren. Elango, while in his study days, falls for a girl in the village named Amudha (Anjali Nair). Chellaiah advises Elango about how important taking care of the family is and what his responsibilities are. He warns him about the effects of falling in love at this age while he has to be responsible and supportive to the family. How Elango tries to balance family and love and what happens thereafter forms the rest of the story.\n\n== Cast ==\n* ''Poo'' Ram as Karuvathevar @ Chelliah (credited as Poo Ramu)\n* [[Mime Gopi]] as Kombiah \n* Elvis Alexander as Elango \n* Anjali Nair as Amudha\n* Ajay Natraj as Maruthapandi \n* [[Senthi Kumari|Senthikumari]] as Pechiamma \n* Aindhu Kovilan as Nambithevar\n\n== Production ==\n=== Development ===\nThe director of the film Selvakannan is an alumnus of Sankar Polytechnic College, Sankar Nagar, Tirunelveli. Nedunalvaadai is the crowd funded Tamil Film. It's been jointly produced by 50 of his college mates joined together to fund and produce this movie. It all started when one of Selvakannan's friends came to know that the latter is struggling to get a producer for his directorial venture. He connected all the classmates through WhatsApp group and finally the film happened.\n<ref name=\"Friends\">{{cite web|url=https://www.deccanchronicle.com/entertainment/kollywood/060119/50-friends-help-make-nedunalvaadai.html|title=50 friends help make Nedunalvaadai|work=Deccan Chronicle|accessdate=6 January 2019}}</ref> \u201cThe first guy through the wall always gets bloody,\u201d says director Selvakannan. Having worked as an assistant to filmmakers [[Rajesh Selva]], Saamy and [[Gandhi Krishna]], Selvakannan decided to take the plunge into direction sometime in 2014. However, none of the producers he met was willing to fund the project. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to convince producers with a slightly offbeat film. Had it not been a [[Karthik Subbaraj]], I don\u2019t think producers would\u2019ve encouraged short filmmakers,\u201d he says.<ref name=\"Subbaraj\" />\n\n=== Cast and crew ===\nWhile the film mostly stars newcomers, Selva has roped in Kaviperarasu [[Vairamuthu]] to pen the lyrics. \"[[Vairamuthu]] sir and editor [[Kasi Viswanathan]] are the only two celebrities in the film,\" he laughs, \"I've assisted [[Vairamuthu]] sir in his office and have known him for a long time. He didn't charge us a penny for writing the lyrics. One of the songs he has written for us \u2013 Karuvatheva Un Kannellam Kanneera \u2013 will be a highlight; he was inspired by his own grandfather while penning it\". Theater personality Poo Ramu, who got critical acclaim for his performance in ''[[Poo (film)|Poo]]'', will be seen as the central character of an aged farmer.<ref name=\"Grandfather\">{{cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/tamil/movies/news/nedunalvaadai-is-an-intriguing-tale-of-a-grandfather-and-a-grandson/articleshow/59823066.cms|title=Nedunalvaadai is an intriguing tale of a grandfather and a grandson|work=Times of India|accessdate=30 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nDirector Selvakannan decided to make Nedunalvaadai, his sole focus was on narrating an impactful story, which will win the appreciation of critics and audience alike. The director says, \"There have been many films in the industry that spoke at length about the relationship between a mother and her child and a father and his child. But, not many have delved into the bond a grandchild shares with his/her grandparents. My film revolves around a 70-year-old man (played by Poo Ramu) and his grandson.\"<ref name=\"Grandfather\" />\n\nAny well-made film, which has a native subject is lapped up by Tamil audiences, [[Kizhakku Cheemayile]], [[Thenmerku Paruvakaatru]] to name a few. Nedunalvaadai is one such intense story based on people who still live in [[Tirunelveli]]. Ramu has lived in the character of a 70-year-old innocent farmer. [[Mime Gopi]] character has shades of grey, [[Senthi Kumari|Senthikumari]] are in the supporting cast and several newcomers cast in the film.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.deccanchronicle.com/entertainment/kollywood/300717/nedunalvaadai-a-film-on-grandpa-grandson-bonding.html|title=Nedunalvaadai is an intriguing tale of a grandfather and a grandson|work=Deccan Chronicle|accessdate=30 July 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"Separation\" />\n\n=== Filming ===\nThe film is set against the backdrop of [[Tirunelveli]]. The shooting of the film took place around the village surrounding [[Vasudevanallur]] and the town [[Puliangudi]]. Selvakannan says,\"It's been more than 17 years since we all studied together in [[Tirunelveli]], but we make it a point to meet every year. We've always wanted to do something to make our polytechnic college proud. So, we decided to make a film on human emotions and showcase our town in a new light. Though many films have been based in [[Tirunelveli]], we felt none portrayed its true essence. So, my friends funded this venture. This is a festival film and I'm hopeful of it bagging a National Award\".<ref name=\"Grandfather\"/>\n\nThe confidence Selvakannan has in his debut directorial venture reflects in his voice when he talks \u201cThere have been many action films that were set in Tirunelveli, but I don\u2019t think any Tamil film has explored its nativity and way of life.

Lyricist [[Vairamuthu]] got impressed with the intense script and wrote lyrics for all the tracks, which is a big plus for this film.\n\n== Plot ==\nChellaiah (Poo Ram) is a simple farmer. He cares so much for the family. He has a son named Kombaiah ([[Mime Gopi]]) and a daughter named Pechiamma ([[Senthi Kumari|Senthikumari]]), who elopes to get married to the love of her life, but he is a drunkard and does not care about his family. Unfortunately, Pechiamma left her husband, and she faces challenges to carry on with living with a son named Elango (Elvis Alexander), as well as a daughter, so she returns to her father. Chellaiah, though unhappy about her act of eloping, takes her family in and starts to support them. However, Kombaiah does not like this. Chellaiah loves and supports his daughter's family and takes care of the education of the grandchildren. Elango, while in his study days, falls for a girl in the village named Amudha (Anjali Nair). Chellaiah advises Elango about how important taking care of the family is and what his responsibilities are. He warns him about the effects of falling in love at this age while he has to be responsible and supportive to the family. How Elango tries to balance family and love and what happens thereafter forms the rest of the story.\n\n== Cast ==\n* ''Poo'' Ram as Karuvathevar @ Chelliah (credited as Poo Ramu)\n* [[Mime Gopi]] as Kombiah \n* Elvis Alexander as Elango \n* Anjali Nair as Amudha\n* Ajay Natraj as Maruthapandi \n* [[Senthi Kumari|Senthikumari]] as Pechiamma \n* Aindhu Kovilan as Nambithevar\n\n== Production ==\n=== Development ===\nThe director of the film Selvakannan is an alumnus of Sankar Polytechnic College, Sankar Nagar, Tirunelveli.
