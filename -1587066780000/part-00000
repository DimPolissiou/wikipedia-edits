''L. barbicornis'' is New Zealand's longest beetle, and shows extreme [[sexual dimorphism]]: males measure up to 90&nbsp;mm, and females 50&nbsp;mm, although there is an extreme range of body sizes in both sexes. In males the elongated snout (or rostrum) can be nearly as long as the body. Male giraffe weevils use this long rostrum to battle over females, although small males can avoid conflict and 'sneak' in to mate with females, sometimes under the noses of large males. The larval weevils tunnel into wood for at least two years before emerging, and live for only a few weeks as adults.\n\n== Taxonomy ==\n[[File:Female Lasiorhynchus barbicornis.jpg|left|thumb|300x300px|Female New Zealand giraffe weevil]]\nThis species was described by the Danish entomologist [[Johan Christian Fabricius]] in 1775, from specimens collected by [[Joseph Banks]] in 1769 on [[First voyage of James Cook|Cook's first voyage]] to New Zealand, presumably from [[Ship Cove (New Zealand)|Ship Cove]] in [[Queen Charlotte Sound (New Zealand)|Queen Charlotte Sound]].<ref name=\"Kuschel2003\">{{Cite book|title=Nemonychidae, Belidae, Brentidae: (Insecta: Coleoptera: Curculionoidea)|last=Kuschel|first=G.|date=2003|publisher=Manaaki Whenua Press|isbn=978-0-478-09348-3|series=Fauna of New Zealand|location=Lincoln, Canterbury, New Zealand}}</ref><ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Kuschel|first=G|date=1970|title=New Zealand Curculionoidea from Captain Cook's voyages (Coleoptera)|url=http://www.bugz.org.nz/WebForms/ResultDetails.aspx?CurrentDoc=6DFC9106-F491-40C6-AC14-6365B84651A8&CurrentPage=1&searchType=1&StartChar=%EF%BF%BD|journal=New Zealand Journal of Science|volume=13|pages=191\u2013205|doi=|pmid=|access-date=25 March 2016}}</ref> Fabricius described the smaller females as a different species, ''Curculio assimilis'', but suspected they were the males of what he named ''Curculio'' ''barbicornis'' (later moved to its own genus, ''Lasiorhynchus'').

In males the elongated snout (or rostrum) can be nearly as long as the body. Male giraffe weevils use this long rostrum to battle over females, although small males can avoid conflict and 'sneak' in to mate with females, sometimes under the noses of large males.

Its range extends from central Argentina in the south to the US-Mexico border in the north, through Central and South America east of the [[Andes]]. The jaguarundi is a medium-sized cat of slender build and uniform coloration that differs significantly from other [[Neotropics|neotropical]] cats (such as the small, spotted cats in the [[genus]] ''[[Leopardus]]'') in its external appearance. In fact, the jaguarundi shows several features seen in [[mustelid]]s (such as [[otter]]s and [[weasel]]s)\u2014it has an elongated body with relatively short legs, a small, narrow head, small, round ears, a short [[snout]] and a long tail. Around twice as large as the [[domestic cat]], the jaguarundi stands {{convert|14|in|cm|abbr=on|order=flip}} at the shoulder and weighs {{convert|3.5|\u2013|7|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. There are two color [[Morph (zoology)|morph]]s\u2014gray and red.\n\nSecretive and alert, the jaguarundi is typically solitary or forms pairs in the wild, though captive individuals are gregarious. Unlike other [[Sympatry|sympatric]] cats such as [[ocelot]]s, the jaguarundi is more active during the day and hunts mainly during daytime and evening hours. Individuals live in large [[home range]]s, and are sparsely distributed within a region. Though an efficient climber and swimmer, the jaguarundi typically prefers hunting on ground. It feeds on various kinds of prey, especially ground-feeding birds, reptiles, [[rodent]]s and small mammals. Mating occurs throughout the year, with peaks at different times of the year across the range. After a [[gestation period]] of 70 to 75 days, the female gives birth to a litter of one to four kittens. Lifespan of up to 15 years has been recorded in captivity.\n\nJaguarundis occur in a broad array of closed as well as open habitats ranging from tropical rainforests and [[deciduous forest]]s to deserts and [[thorn scrub]]s.

Estrus lasts three to five days, marked by the female regularly rolling onto her back and [[spraying urine]]. [[Sexually mature]] males will pursue the female, not reacting to any aggressive behavior from her side. As in many other felids, the male bites the fur on the female's neck on mounting; the female lets out a loud scream on penetration.<ref name=WCoW/><ref name=ms/>\n\nAfter a [[gestation]] period of 70 to 75 days, the female gives birth to a litter of one to four kittens in a den constructed in a dense thicket, hollow tree, or similar cover. The kittens are covered well with fur and the underside is marked with spots, which disappear as they age; the coat color gradually changes as the kittens grow older.<ref name=WCoW/><ref name=ceballos/> The mother starts bringing solid food for the kittens when they are around three weeks old, who simply play with it till the mother ingests it; kittens are capable of taking solid food like birds and guinea pigs at around six weeks. Jaguarundis become sexually mature at one to three years of age. Lifespan up to 15 years has been recorded in captivity.<ref name=WCoW/><ref name=Nowak/>\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\nThe jaguarundi inhabits a wide variety of habitats\u2014from tropical rainforests and [[deciduous forest]]s to deserts and [[thorn scrub]]s.

[[felidae|cat]] native to the Americas. Its range extends from central Argentina in the south to the US-Mexico border in the north, through Central and South America east of the [[Andes]]. The jaguarundi is a medium-sized cat of slender build and uniform coloration that differs significantly from other [[Neotropics|neotropical]] cats (such as the small, spotted cats in the [[genus]] ''[[Leopardus]]'') in its external appearance. In fact, the jaguarundi shows several features seen in [[mustelid]]s (such as [[otter]]s and [[weasel]]s)\u2014it has an elongated body with relatively short legs, a small, narrow head, small, round ears, a short [[snout]] and a long tail. Around twice as large as the [[domestic cat]], the jaguarundi stands {{convert|14|in|cm|abbr=on|order=flip}} at the shoulder and weighs {{convert|3.5|\u2013|7|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. There are two color [[Morph (zoology)|morph]]s\u2014gray and red.\n\nSecretive and alert, the jaguarundi is typically solitary or forms pairs in the wild, though captive individuals are gregarious. Unlike other [[Sympatry|sympatric]] cats such as [[ocelot]]s, the jaguarundi is more active during the day and hunts mainly during daytime and evening hours. Individuals live in large [[home range]]s, and are sparsely distributed within a region. Though an efficient climber and swimmer, the jaguarundi typically prefers hunting on ground. It feeds on various kinds of prey, especially ground-feeding birds, reptiles, [[rodent]]s and small mammals. Mating occurs throughout the year, with peaks at different times of the year across the range. After a [[gestation period]] of 70 to 75 days, the female gives birth to a litter of one to four kittens. Lifespan of up to 15 years has been recorded in captivity.\n\nJaguarundis occur in a broad array of closed as well as open habitats ranging from tropical rainforests and [[deciduous forest]]s to deserts and [[thorn scrub]]s. While they are fairly common in Brazil, Peru and Venezuela, jaguarundis may have gone [[extinct]] in the US. The [[IUCN]] lists the jaguarundi as [[Least Concern]], but populations are in decline in many parts of its range due to loss and [[Habitat fragmentation|fragmentation]] of their habitat and persecution for killing poultry.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe common name \"jaguarundi\" ({{IPAc-en|\u02cc|\u0292|\u00e6|\u0261|w|\u0259|\u02c8|r|\u028c|n|d|i}}) comes from the [[Guarani language|Old Guarani]] word ''yaguarundi'', similar to the [[Old Tupi]] word ''yawaum'di''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ferreira |first=A.B.H. |year=1986 |title=Novo Dicion\u00e1rio da L\u00edngua Portuguesa|language=Portuguese |trans-title=New Dictionary of the Portuguese Language |edition=2nd|place=Rio de Janeiro |publisher=Nova Fronteira |page=980}}</ref><ref>{{Cite Merriam-Webster|jaguarundi|accessdate=10 April 2020}}</ref> In some [[Spanish language|Spanish]]-speaking countries, the jaguarundi is also called ''gato colorado'', ''gato moro'', ''le\u00f3n brenero'', ''leoncillo'' and ''tigrillo''.<ref name=iucn/> It is also called ''eyra'', ''gato-mourisco'', ''gato-preto'', ''gato-vermelho'' and ''maracaj\u00e1-preto'' in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=de Miranda |first1=E.E. |last2=Gambarini |first2=A. |title=Natureza, Conserva\u00e7\u00e3o e Cultura: Ensaio sobre a Rela\u00e7\u00e3o do Homem com a Natureza no Brasil |trans-title=Nature, Conservation and Culture: Essay on the Relationship between Man and Nature in Brazil |date=2003 |publisher=Metalivros |location=S\u00e3o Paulo |isbn=9788585371470 |page=113 |language=Portuguese}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Nowell |editor1-first=K. |editor2-last=Jackson |editor2-first=P. |editor3-last=IUCN/SSC Cat Specialist Group |title=Wild Cats: Status Survey and Conservation Action Plan |date=1996 |publisher=IUCN |location=Gland |isbn=978-2-8317-0045-8 |page=146}}</ref>\n\n==Taxonomy==\n''Felis yagouarundi'' was the [[scientific name]] used by [[\u00c9tienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]] in 1803 who described two [[zoological specimen|specimen]]s from Central America, including one from [[French Guiana]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, \u00c9. |authorlink=\u00c9tienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire |year=1803 |title=Catalogue des Mammif\u00e8res du Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle |trans-title=Catalogue of Mammals of the National Museum of Natural History| language=French |location=Paris |publisher=Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle |page=124 |chapter=Le chat yagouarundi.

In captivity, females in [[estrus]] have been observed making faint sounds as they [[scent mark]] the area around their enclosures.<ref name=WCoW/><ref name=ms/> \n\n===Diet===\n[[File:Puma yagouaroundi, ZOO Praha 254.jpg|thumb|Jaguarundis are [[Generalist and specialist species|generalist]] carnivores.]]\nThe jaguarundi typically feed on small-sized prey weighing less than {{convert|1|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, including ground-feeding birds, reptiles, [[rodent]]s and small mammals. Jaguarundis will also take larger prey such as domestic poultry, fish, [[marmoset]]s, rabbits and [[opossum]]s; a study recorded small deer (possibly [[carrion]]) in the diet. Vegetation such as grasses have also been recorded in their diet.<ref name=Hunter/><ref name=WCoW/><ref name=ceballos/><ref name=ms/> A study showed jaguarundis take {{convert|400|g|oz|abbr=on}} vertebrate prey on an average everyday.<ref name=ms/> The broad array of prey recorded for the jaguarundi across its range and varying proportions of different prey in its diet could indicate that the cat tends to feed on the most abundant and easily catchable prey in the area.<ref name=WCoW/>\n\n===Reproduction===\nJaguarundis have been observed mating all year round, with peaks at different times of the year across the range; for instance, in Mexico breeding peaks in January and March. Estrus lasts three to five days, marked by the female regularly rolling onto her back and [[spraying urine]]. [[Sexually mature]] males will pursue the female, not reacting to any aggressive behavior from her side. As in many other felids, the male bites the fur on the female's neck on mounting; the female lets out a loud scream on penetration.<ref name=WCoW/><ref name=ms/>\n\nAfter a [[gestation]] period of 70 to 75 days, the female gives birth to a litter of one to four kittens in a den constructed in a dense thicket, hollow tree, or similar cover. The kittens are covered well with fur and the underside is marked with spots, which disappear as they age; the coat color gradually changes as the kittens grow older.<ref name=WCoW/><ref name=ceballos/> The mother starts bringing solid food for the kittens when they are around three weeks old, who simply play with it till the mother ingests it; kittens are capable of taking solid food like birds and guinea pigs at around six weeks. Jaguarundis become sexually mature at one to three years of age. Lifespan up to 15 years has been recorded in captivity.<ref name=WCoW/><ref name=Nowak/>\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\nThe jaguarundi inhabits a wide variety of habitats\u2014from tropical rainforests and [[deciduous forest]]s to deserts and [[thorn scrub]]s. It can also occur in [[cloud forest]]s, [[mangrove]]s and [[savanna]]s.<ref name=iucn/><ref name=ceballos/> Unlike the [[Sympatry|sympatric]] [[margay]], [[ocelot]] and [[oncilla]], the jaguarundi can occur in open areas as well. In open habitats the jaguarundi prefers areas with vegetative cover such as cacti, which would generally be difficult for possible predators to penetrate; there may be a few clearings at the periphery of such areas. Jaguarundis tend to stay close to a source of running water.<ref name=WCoW/><ref name=fws.gov/><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Coronado-Quibrera |first1=W.P. |last2=Olmos-Oropeza |first2=G. |last3=Bender |first3=L.C. |last4=Rosas-Rosas |first4=O.C. |last5=Palacio-N\u00fa\u00f1ez |first5=J. |last6=Tarango-Ar\u00e1mbula |first6=L.A. |last7=Herrera-Haro |first7=J.G. |title=Adaptability of the threatened jaguarundi (''Herpailurus yagouaroundi'' Schereber, 1777) to human-altered environments in San Luis Potos\u00ed, Mexico |journal=Acta Zool\u00f3gica Mexicana |date=2019 |volume=35 |pages=1\u201315 |doi=10.21829/azm.2019.3502210 |url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/310f/6597fd914eb664e160637b4b1b1d57d87fe7.pdf}}</ref> The jaguarundi is noted for its resistance to environmental disturbances in its habitat; it can successfully thrive in reforested areas.<ref name=ceballos/> While commonly inhabiting lowlands up to {{convert|2000|m|ft|abbr=on}} above the sea level, this cat has been reported at elevations as high as {{convert|3200|m|ft|abbr=on}} in Colombia.<ref name=iucn/>\n\nThe range extends from central Argentina in the south to the US-Mexico border in the north, through Central and South America east of the Andes\u2014second only to the cougar in the [[Latitude|latitudinal]] extent of its distribution.
