All legislation, government and corporate policies and organisational structures impact on the way people relate, but this impact is generally not considered by those making policy decisions. \n\nImprovement in the quality of relationships is not only necessary but also possible \u2013 and if we can enable relational restoration to happen, the quality of life globally can be significantly enhanced. The overall approach can be considered as a critique of Capitalism as well as Socialism, or perhaps even as an alternative framework for public policy. It is sometimes called \u2018Relationism\u2019 or, more commonly, Relational Thinking.\n\n''The R Factor'' was received by many people as a call to action. Even though Schluter has co-authored other books and reports since then (e.g. ''The Jubilee Manifesto'', ''The Relational Manager, Transforming Capitalism from Within, The Relational Lens,'' and ''Confederal Europe''), few publications by any author in the last few decades have had its range of impact on individuals, on families, on organisations, and on structures.\n\n==Relational Thinking==\n\nSchluter has founded two organizations which research relationships, Relationships Foundation and Relational Research. A number of practical and more specific initiatives based on the relational approach have developed out of his work. These include Credit Action to help tackle the effects of consumer debt, which subsequently became part of the Money Charity; Allia which tackles unemployment and funding of social enterprise through encouraging the use of capital to achieve social outcomes; and Relational Schools which seeks to reform the culture and values in schools. Another initiative has been the Marriage Foundation, which promotes long-term committed relationship through the institution of marriage. \u00a0 \n\n''The R Factor'' sets out the five essential dimensions of any and every relationship (personal, organisational or international). Those dimensions are collectively referred to as the Relational Proximity Framework. Schluter recognised that measurement of quality of relationships was crucial if relational assessment was to be used in public decision making. In an organisational context, any relationship measurement must be two-sided, because, to state the obvious, no relationship is one-sided. The measurement process and tools are referred to as \u201crelational analytics\u201d. Given the tens of thousands of measurements that have been carried out already across schools, companies, the health sector, prisons, elderly care, and the non-profit sector, it has been possible to have the relational analytics tools statistically validated. \n\n==International Peace Work==\n\nIn 1987 Schluter with colleagues initiated a peace process under the name Newick Park Initiative<ref name=\"Concordisinternational\">{{cite web|url=http://concordis-international.org/about-us/south-africa-1987-1991/|title=Concordis 1987-1991|website=Concordis International|access-date=2014-09-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141015004015/http://concordis-international.org/about-us/south-africa-1987-1991/|archive-date=2014-10-15|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=\"Endgame\">{{citation|last=Esterhuyse|first=Willie|title=Endgame: Secret Talks and the End of Apartheid|date=April 17, 2012|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O2dRBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=endgame+secret+apartheid#v=onepage&q=endgame%20secret%20apartheid&f=false|publisher=Tafelberg|isbn=978-0-6240-5427-6}}</ref> (NPI) in [[South Africa]], which held deliberately low-profile conferences between 1987 and 1997, bringing together the leaders of the [[African National Congress]] (ANC) and the White political leadership to discuss key issues so as to ease the path to a political settlement.<ref name=\"Newick Park\">{{cite web|url=http://www.jubilee-centre.org/history-newick-park-initiative-jeremy-ive/|title=History of the Newick Park Initiative|last1=Ive|first1=Jeremy|website=Jubilee Centre|accessdate=16 December 2015}}</ref> NPI\u2019s director facilitated Inkatha joining the South African election just three weeks before the first free elections in 1994. \n\nThe work in South Africa led on to a peace initiative in Rwanda after the [[Rwandan genocide|genocide]] there,<ref name=\"Rwandafood\">{{cite journal|date=1996|title=Newick Park Initiative: Policy priorities to achieve agricultural growth in Rwanda|url=http://s3.amazonaws.com/zanran_storage/www.grandslacs.net/ContentPages/797071061.pdf}}</ref> followed by a peace process between North and South Sudan.<ref>Hauss, C. , The Continuum International Publishing Group Inc, 2010.

All legislation, government and corporate policies and organisational structures impact on the way people relate, but this impact is generally not considered by those making policy decisions. \n\nImprovement in the quality of relationships is not only necessary but also possible \u2013 and if we can enable relational restoration to happen, the quality of life globally can be significantly enhanced. The overall approach can be considered as a critique of Capitalism as well as Socialism, or perhaps even as an alternative framework for public policy. It is sometimes called \u2018Relationism\u2019 or, more commonly, Relational Thinking.\n\n''The R Factor'' was received by many people as a call to action. Even though Schluter has co-authored other books and reports since then (e.g. ''The Jubilee Manifesto'', ''The Relational Manager, Transforming Capitalism from Within, The Relational Lens,'' and ''Confederal Europe''), few publications by any author in the last few decades have had its range of impact on individuals, on families, on organisations, and on structures.\n\n==Relational Thinking==\n\nSchluter has founded two organizations which research relationships, Relationships Foundation and Relational Research. A number of practical and more specific initiatives based on the relational approach have developed out of his work. These include Credit Action to help tackle the effects of consumer debt, which subsequently became part of the Money Charity; Allia which tackles unemployment and funding of social enterprise through encouraging the use of capital to achieve social outcomes; and Relational Schools which seeks to reform the culture and values in schools. Another initiative has been the Marriage Foundation, which promotes long-term committed relationship through the institution of marriage. \u00a0 \n\n''The R Factor'' sets out the five essential dimensions of any and every relationship (personal, organisational or international). Those dimensions are collectively referred to as the Relational Proximity Framework. Schluter recognised that measurement of quality of relationships was crucial if relational assessment was to be used in public decision making. In an organisational context, any relationship measurement must be two-sided, because, to state the obvious, no relationship is one-sided. The measurement process and tools are referred to as \u201crelational analytics\u201d. Given the tens of thousands of measurements that have been carried out already across schools, companies, the health sector, prisons, elderly care, and the non-profit sector, it has been possible to have the relational analytics tools statistically validated. \n\n==International Peace Work==\n\nIn 1987 Schluter with colleagues initiated a peace process under the name Newick Park Initiative<ref name=\"Concordisinternational\">{{cite web|url=http://concordis-international.org/about-us/south-africa-1987-1991/|title=Concordis 1987-1991|website=Concordis International|access-date=2014-09-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141015004015/http://concordis-international.org/about-us/south-africa-1987-1991/|archive-date=2014-10-15|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=\"Endgame\">{{citation|last=Esterhuyse|first=Willie|title=Endgame: Secret Talks and the End of Apartheid|date=April 17, 2012|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O2dRBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=endgame+secret+apartheid#v=onepage&q=endgame%20secret%20apartheid&f=false|publisher=Tafelberg|isbn=978-0-6240-5427-6}}</ref> (NPI) in [[South Africa]], which held deliberately low-profile conferences between 1987 and 1997, bringing together the leaders of the [[African National Congress]] (ANC) and the White political leadership to discuss key issues so as to ease the path to a political settlement.<ref name=\"Newick Park\">{{cite web|url=http://www.jubilee-centre.org/history-newick-park-initiative-jeremy-ive/|title=History of the Newick Park Initiative|last1=Ive|first1=Jeremy|website=Jubilee Centre|accessdate=16 December 2015}}</ref> NPI\u2019s director facilitated Inkatha joining the South African election just three weeks before the first free elections in 1994. \n\nThe work in South Africa led on to a peace initiative in Rwanda after the [[Rwandan genocide|genocide]] there,<ref name=\"Rwandafood\">{{cite journal|date=1996|title=Newick Park Initiative: Policy priorities to achieve agricultural growth in Rwanda|url=http://s3.amazonaws.com/zanran_storage/www.grandslacs.net/ContentPages/797071061.pdf}}</ref> followed by a peace process between North and South Sudan.<ref>Hauss, C. , The Continuum International Publishing Group Inc, 2010.
