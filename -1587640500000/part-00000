Having left school at an early age he pursued several odd jobs before settling on a career in writing.

He left there in 1940 due to the hostilities, but wrote ''Pacific Sonnets'' during his tenure.\n\nHe then travelled to the [[United States]] where he began his longtime liaison with writer [[Elizabeth Smart (author)|Elizabeth Smart]], by whom he had four of his fifteen children.

From the late 1960s until his death, he lived in [[Itteringham]], [[Norfolk]], with his wife [[Elspeth Barker]], the novelist.

Having left school at an early age he pursued several odd jobs before settling on a career in writing. Early volumes of note by Barker include ''Thirty Preliminary Poems'' (1933), ''Poems'' (1935) and ''Calamiterror'' (1937), which was inspired by the [[Spanish Civil War]],<ref>D.

Eliot]] at [[Faber and Faber]], who also helped him to gain appointment as Professor of English Literature in 1939 at [[Tohoku University]] ([[Sendai, Miyagi]], [[Japan]]). He left there in 1940 due to the hostilities, but wrote ''Pacific Sonnets'' during his tenure.\n\nHe then travelled to the [[United States]] where he began his longtime liaison with writer [[Elizabeth Smart (author)|Elizabeth Smart]], by whom he had four of his fifteen children.  Barker also had three children by his first wife, Jessica.<ref>{{cite news |first=Ian |last=Sansom |authorlink= |author= |coauthors= |title=Master of the red Martini |url=http://books.guardian.co.uk/reviews/biography/0,,660088,00.html |work= |publisher=[[The Guardian]]  |pages= |page= |date=March 2, 2002 |accessdate=2008-07-08 |language= |quote=Jessica has just given birth to his twins, Elizabeth Smart is busy giving birth to her second child by him, and he is spending most of his time drinking in London. }}</ref> He returned to England in 1943. From the late 1960s until his death, he lived in [[Itteringham]], [[Norfolk]], with his wife [[Elspeth Barker]], the novelist.

Of the nine battles mentioned by the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' during that year, only one was a West Saxon victory; but in this year Alfred succeeded his brother Ethelred, who died after the [[Battle of Merton]].<ref name=garmonsway70>Garmonsway, ''The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', pp. 70-73</ref>\n\n[[Mercia]] had collapsed by 874, and the Army's cohesion went with it. Halfdan went back to Northumbria and fought the [[Picts]] and the [[Kingdom of Strathclyde|Strathclyde]] Welsh to secure his northern kingdom.<ref name=\"jones221\">Jones, ''A History of the Vikings'', p. 221</ref> His army settled there and he is not mentioned after 876, when \"[the Danes] were engaged in ploughing and making a living for themselves\".<ref name=\"jones221\"/> Guthrum, with two other unnamed kings, \"departed for [[Cambridge]] in East Anglia\".<ref name=\"jones221\" /> He made several attacks on Wessex, starting in 875, and in the last nearly captured Alfred in his winter fortress at [[Chippenham]].<ref name=\"jones221\" />\nBy 878, the Danes held the east and northeast of England, and their defeat at the [[Battle of Ashdown]] had paused but not halted their advance. Alfred the Great had spent the winter preceding the Battle of Edington in the Somerset marsh of [[Athelney]], the nature of the country giving him some protection. In the spring of 878, he summoned his [[Kingdom of the West Saxons|West Saxon]] forces and marched to Edington, where he met the Danes, led by Guthrum, in battle.\n\n==Alfred's position before the battle==\nGuthrum and his men had applied the usual Danish strategy of occupying a fortified town and waiting for a peace \u201ctreaty,\u201d involving money in return for a promise to leave the kingdom immediately; Alfred shadowed the army, trying to prevent more damage than had already occurred. This started in 875 when Guthrum's army \u201celuded the West Saxon levies and got into Wareham\u201d.<ref name=\"G74\">Garmonsway, ''The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', p. 74</ref> They then gave hostages and oaths to leave the country to Alfred, who paid them off.<ref name=\"Smyth 70\">Smyth, ''King Alfred the Great'', p. 70</ref> The Danes promptly slipped off to Exeter, even deeper into Alfred's kingdom, where they concluded in the autumn of 877 a \"firm peace\" with Alfred,<ref name=G74/> under terms that entailed their leaving his kingdom and not returning.<ref name=\"Smyth 72\">Smyth, ''King Alfred the Great'', p. 72</ref> This they did, spending the rest of 877 (by the Gregorian calendar) in [[Gloucester]].<ref name=\"Smyth 72\"/> Alfred spent [[Christmas]] at Chippenham, thirty miles from Gloucester. The Danes attacked Chippenham \"in midwinter after Twelfth Night\",<ref name=G74/> probably during the night of 6\u20137 January 878. They captured Chippenham and forced Alfred to retreat \"with a small force\" into the wilderness.<ref name=G74/> It is to this period that the story of King Alfred burning the cakes belongs.<ref name=horspool2>Horspool, ''Why Alfred burnt the cakes'', pp. 2&nbsp;\u2013 3. Although there may have been an early oral tradition about the burning of the cakes, there is no contemporary evidence for the cake story. The first time it appears is one hundred years later and it may have been invented to make an obscure saint [St Neot] look good.</ref>\n\nAlfred seems at this time to have ineffectually chased the Danes around Wessex, while the Danes were in a position to do as they pleased. The ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' attempts to convey the impression that Alfred held the initiative; it is \"a bland chronicle which laconically charts the movements of the Danish victors while at the same time disingenuously striving to convey the impression that Alfred was in control\",<ref name=\"Smyth 70\" /> although it fails. Even if Alfred had caught up with the Danish force, it is unlikely that he could have accomplished anything. The fact that his army could not defend the fortified Chippenham, even in \"an age... as yet untrained in siege warfare\"<ref name=\"Smyth 70\"/> casts great doubt on its ability to defeat the Danes in an open field, unaided by fortifications. There was little that Alfred could do about the Danish menace between 875 and the end of 877, beyond repeatedly paying the invaders off.\n\n==Battle==\n[[File:King Alfred's Tower, Stourhead, Somerset.jpg|thumb|left| upright=1.4 |[[King Alfred's Tower]] (1772) on one supposed site of ''Egbert's Stone'', the mustering place before the battle.<ref>Horspool, ''Why Alfred Burnt the Cakes'', p. 173.

With his small warband, a fraction of his army at Chippenham, Alfred could not hope to retake the town from the Danes, who had in previous battles (for example at [[Battle of Reading (871)|Reading]] in 871) proved themselves adept at defending fortified positions.<ref name=garmonsway70/> So he retreated to the south, preparing himself and his forces for another battle, and then defeated Guthrum and his host.

He overthrew the Pagans with great slaughter, and smiting the fugitives, he pursued them as far as the fortress.\"<ref name=smyth26/>}}\n\nAfter the victory, when the Danes had taken refuge in the fortress, the West Saxons removed all food that the Danes might be able to capture in a sortie, and waited.<ref name=smyth26/> After two weeks, the hungry Danes sued for peace, giving Alfred \"preliminary hostages and solemn oaths that they would leave his kingdom immediately\", just as usual, but in addition promising that Guthrum would be baptized.<ref name=\"g76l26\"/> The primary difference between this agreement and the treaties at [[Wareham, Dorset|Wareham]] and [[Exeter]] was that Alfred had decisively defeated the Danes at Edington, rather than just stopping them, and therefore it seemed more likely that they would keep to the terms of the treaty.\n\nThe primary reason for Alfred's victory was probably the relative size of the two armies. The men of even one [[shire]] could be a formidable fighting force, as those of [[Devon]] proved in the same year, defeating an army under [[Ubba|Ubbe Ragnarsson]] at the [[Battle of Cynwit]].<ref name=smyth26/> In addition, in 875 Guthrum had lost the support of other Danish lords, including Ivar and Ubba. Further Danish forces had settled on the land before Guthrum attacked Wessex: in East Anglia, and in Mercia between the treaty at Exeter and the attack on Chippenham; many others were lost in a storm off [[Swanage]] in 876-7, with 120 ships wrecked.<ref name=S74/> Internal disunity was threatening to tear the Danes apart, and they needed time to reorganize.

However, Alfred managed to contain this threat by reforming his military and setting up a system of fortified cities, known as ''burghs'' or [[burh]]s.<ref name=yorke176 />\n\nIn 885 Asser reports that the Viking army that had settled in East Anglia had broken ''in a most insolent manner'' the peace they had established with Alfred, although Guthrum is not mentioned.<ref name=asser72>Asser, ''Life'', ch. 72</ref> Guthrum reigned as king in East Anglia until his death in 890, and although this period was not always peaceful he was not considered a threat.<ref name=yorke176 /><ref name=asc890>ASC 890.

Alfred the Great had spent the winter preceding the Battle of Edington in the Somerset marsh of [[Athelney]], the nature of the country giving him some protection. In the spring of 878, he summoned his [[Kingdom of the West Saxons|West Saxon]] forces and marched to Edington, where he met the Danes, led by Guthrum, in battle.\n\n==Alfred's position before the battle==\nGuthrum and his men had applied the usual Danish strategy of occupying a fortified town and waiting for a peace \u201ctreaty,\u201d involving money in return for a promise to leave the kingdom immediately; Alfred shadowed the army, trying to prevent more damage than had already occurred. This started in 875 when Guthrum's army \u201celuded the West Saxon levies and got into Wareham\u201d.<ref name=\"G74\">Garmonsway, ''The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', p. 74</ref> They then gave hostages and oaths to leave the country to Alfred, who paid them off.<ref name=\"Smyth 70\">Smyth, ''King Alfred the Great'', p. 70</ref> The Danes promptly slipped off to Exeter, even deeper into Alfred's kingdom, where they concluded in the autumn of 877 a \"firm peace\" with Alfred,<ref name=G74/> under terms that entailed their leaving his kingdom and not returning.<ref name=\"Smyth 72\">Smyth, ''King Alfred the Great'', p. 72</ref> This they did, spending the rest of 877 (by the Gregorian calendar) in [[Gloucester]].<ref name=\"Smyth 72\"/> Alfred spent [[Christmas]] at Chippenham, thirty miles from Gloucester. The Danes attacked Chippenham \"in midwinter after Twelfth Night\",<ref name=G74/> probably during the night of 6\u20137 January 878. They captured Chippenham and forced Alfred to retreat \"with a small force\" into the wilderness.<ref name=G74/> It is to this period that the story of King Alfred burning the cakes belongs.<ref name=horspool2>Horspool, ''Why Alfred burnt the cakes'', pp. 2&nbsp;\u2013 3. Although there may have been an early oral tradition about the burning of the cakes, there is no contemporary evidence for the cake story. The first time it appears is one hundred years later and it may have been invented to make an obscure saint [St Neot] look good.</ref>\n\nAlfred seems at this time to have ineffectually chased the Danes around Wessex, while the Danes were in a position to do as they pleased. The ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' attempts to convey the impression that Alfred held the initiative; it is \"a bland chronicle which laconically charts the movements of the Danish victors while at the same time disingenuously striving to convey the impression that Alfred was in control\",<ref name=\"Smyth 70\" /> although it fails. Even if Alfred had caught up with the Danish force, it is unlikely that he could have accomplished anything. The fact that his army could not defend the fortified Chippenham, even in \"an age... as yet untrained in siege warfare\"<ref name=\"Smyth 70\"/> casts great doubt on its ability to defeat the Danes in an open field, unaided by fortifications. There was little that Alfred could do about the Danish menace between 875 and the end of 877, beyond repeatedly paying the invaders off.\n\n==Battle==\n[[File:King Alfred's Tower, Stourhead, Somerset.jpg|thumb|left| upright=1.4 |[[King Alfred's Tower]] (1772) on one supposed site of ''Egbert's Stone'', the mustering place before the battle.<ref>Horspool, ''Why Alfred Burnt the Cakes'', p. 173.

He overthrew the Pagans with great slaughter, and smiting the fugitives, he pursued them as far as the fortress.\"<ref name=smyth26/>}}\n\nAfter the victory, when the Danes had taken refuge in the fortress, the West Saxons removed all food that the Danes might be able to capture in a sortie, and waited.<ref name=smyth26/> After two weeks, the hungry Danes sued for peace, giving Alfred \"preliminary hostages and solemn oaths that they would leave his kingdom immediately\", just as usual, but in addition promising that Guthrum would be baptized.<ref name=\"g76l26\"/> The primary difference between this agreement and the treaties at [[Wareham, Dorset|Wareham]] and [[Exeter]] was that Alfred had decisively defeated the Danes at Edington, rather than just stopping them, and therefore it seemed more likely that they would keep to the terms of the treaty.\n\nThe primary reason for Alfred's victory was probably the relative size of the two armies. The men of even one [[shire]] could be a formidable fighting force, as those of [[Devon]] proved in the same year, defeating an army under [[Ubba|Ubbe Ragnarsson]] at the [[Battle of Cynwit]].<ref name=smyth26/> In addition, in 875 Guthrum had lost the support of other Danish lords, including Ivar and Ubba. Further Danish forces had settled on the land before Guthrum attacked Wessex: in East Anglia, and in Mercia between the treaty at Exeter and the attack on Chippenham; many others were lost in a storm off [[Swanage]] in 876-7, with 120 ships wrecked.<ref name=S74/> Internal disunity was threatening to tear the Danes apart, and they needed time to reorganize. Fortunately for Wessex, they did not use the time available effectively.\n{{clear}}\n\n==Location of the battle==\n[[Image:asser facsimile.png|thumb|right|150px|A 1722 copy of part of Asser's Life of King Alfred.]]\nThe primary sources for the location of the battle are [[Asser]]'s ''Life of King Alfred'', which names the place as \"''Ethandun''\" and the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', which has ''E\u00f0andune''.

While still in college, Ritter traveled to the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and West Germany to perform in plays. Ritter graduated in 1970.<ref name=lipton>{{cite magazine| last=Lipton| first=Michael A.| title=Acting His Age| url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20138768,00.html| magazine=People| date=December 16, 2002| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141107160642/http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20138768,00.html| archivedate=November 7, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n\n===Film and television===\n[[File:John Ritter 1977.jpg|thumb|Ritter as [[Jack Tripper]], 1977]]\nRitter headlined several stage performances. After his graduation from USC in 1970, his first TV acting experience was a campus revolutionary in the TV series ''[[Dan August]]'' starring [[Burt Reynolds]] and future ''Three's Company'' co-star [[Norman Fell]]. Ritter made his film debut in the 1971 Disney film ''[[The Barefoot Executive]]''. He made guest appearances on the television series ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]'', ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'', and many others. He had a recurring role as the Reverend Matthew Fordwick on the drama series ''[[The Waltons]]'' from October 1972 to December 1976. Because he was not a weekly cast member, he had time to pursue other roles, which he did until December 1976, when he left for a starring role in the hit sitcom ''[[Three's Company]]'' (the Americanized version of the 1970s British [[Thames Television]] series ''[[Man About the House]]'') in 1977. In 1978, Ritter played [[Ringo Starr]]'s manager on the TV special ''[[Ringo (1978 film)|Ringo]]''. In 1982, Ritter provided the voice of Peter Dickinson in ''[[The Flight of Dragons]]''.\n\nRitter became a household name playing struggling culinary student [[Jack Tripper]] with two female roommates. Ritter co-starred opposite [[Joyce DeWitt]] and [[Suzanne Somers]], and then later [[Jenilee Harrison]] and [[Priscilla Barnes]]. Much of the comedy centered around Jack's pretending to be gay to keep the old-fashioned landlords appeased over the seemingly sordid living arrangements. The series spent several seasons near the top of the TV ratings in the U.S. before ending in 1984. A year-long spin-off ''[[Three's a Crowd]]'' ensued, as the Jack Tripper character has a live-in girlfriend and runs his own bistro. The original series has been seen continuously in reruns and is available on DVD. During the run of ''Three's Company'', Ritter appeared in the films ''[[Hero at Large]]'', ''[[Americathon]]'', and ''[[They All Laughed]]''. In 1986, he played the role of Dad in the music video for [[Graham Nash]]'s song \"Innocent Eyes\" from the [[Innocent Eyes (Graham Nash album)|album of the same name]].\n\n''[[Hooperman]]'' was Ritter's first regular television role after ''Three's Company''. Detective Harry Hooperman inherits a run-down apartment building and hires Susan Smith ([[Debrah Farentino]]) to run it. A relationship follows, and Hooperman must juggle work, love, and the antics of Bijoux the dog. In 1988, John was nominated for both an [[Emmy Award]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.emmys.com/celebrities/john-ritter |title=John Ritter Emmy Nominated |publisher=Emmys.com |date=September 12, 2003 |accessdate=December 12, 2014}}</ref> and a [[Golden Globe Award]] for his work on ''Hooperman''. Ritter won a [[People's Choice Awards|People's Choice Award]] for this role. From 1992 to 1995, Ritter returned to television for three seasons as John Hartman, aide to a U.S. Senator in ''[[Hearts Afire]]''. This series starred [[Markie Post]] as Georgie Anne Lahti and [[Billy Bob Thornton]] as Billy Bob Davis. He also played Garry Lejeune / Roger Tramplemain in the production ''Noises Off'' in 1992.\n\nAfter his time on television, he appeared in a number of movies, most notably ''[[Problem Child (film)|Problem Child]]'' and its [[Problem Child 2|first sequel]]. He played the lead role in [[Blake Edwards]]' 1989 film ''[[Skin Deep (1989 film)|Skin Deep]]'', appeared in the film version of ''[[Noises Off (film)|Noises Off]]'', rejoined Billy Bob Thornton in the [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]-winning ''[[Sling Blade]]'' (playing a kindhearted, gay, discount-store manager), and co-starred with [[Olivier Gruner]] in the 1996 action film ''Mercenary''. Ritter starred in many made-for-TV movies, including ''Gramps'' (1995), co-starring with [[Andy Griffith]], Rob Hedden's ''The Colony'' (1995) with [[Hal Linden]], [[Stephen King]]'s ''[[It (miniseries)|It]]'', ''Danielle Steel's Heartbeat'' with [[Polly Draper]], and ''[[It Came From the Sky (film)|It Came From the Sky]]'' in 1999 with [[Yasmine Bleeth]].\n\nRitter also made guest appearances on TV shows, such as ''[[Felicity (TV series)|Felicity]]'', ''[[Ally McBeal]],'' ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]],'' ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'', and an episode of ''[[Law & Order: SVU]]'' (2002). He also provided the voice of the [[Clifford (character)|title character]] in the animated children's show ''[[Clifford the Big Red Dog (TV series)|Clifford the Big Red Dog]]'', a role for which he received four [[Daytime Emmy Award|Emmy]] nominations. His final film was ''[[Stanley's Dinosaur Round-Up]]'' (2006), an animated direct-to-DVD film based on the television series, which was dedicated to his memory.\n\nAt the time of his death he was starring in ''[[8 Simple Rules|8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter]]''.\n\n===Theater===\nRitter played Claude Pichon in ''[[The Dinner Party (play)|The Dinner Party]]'' (2000) at the [[Music Box Theatre]] on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], which was written by [[Neil Simon]].

The purpose of the JRF is to provide accurate information to the general public about the disease and its risk factors, provide support to individuals who have thoracic aortic disease or have lost a loved one to the disease, and improve the identification of individuals at risk for aortic dissections and the treatment of thoracic aortic disease through medical research. Yasbeck worked with the [[University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston]] (UTHealth) to establish the John Ritter Research Program in Aortic and Vascular Diseases with the goal of preventing premature deaths due to aortic dissection by identifying genetic mutations that predispose individuals to thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections.\n\n==Filmography==\n\n===Film===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

While still in college, Ritter traveled to the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and West Germany to perform in plays. Ritter graduated in 1970.<ref name=lipton>{{cite magazine| last=Lipton| first=Michael A.| title=Acting His Age| url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20138768,00.html| magazine=People| date=December 16, 2002| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141107160642/http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20138768,00.html| archivedate=November 7, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n\n===Film and television===\n[[File:John Ritter 1977.jpg|thumb|Ritter as [[Jack Tripper]], 1977]]\nRitter headlined several stage performances. After his graduation from USC in 1970, his first TV acting experience was a campus revolutionary in the TV series ''[[Dan August]]'' starring [[Burt Reynolds]] and future ''Three's Company'' co-star [[Norman Fell]]. Ritter made his film debut in the 1971 Disney film ''[[The Barefoot Executive]]''. He made guest appearances on the television series ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]'', ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'', and many others. He had a recurring role as the Reverend Matthew Fordwick on the drama series ''[[The Waltons]]'' from October 1972 to December 1976. Because he was not a weekly cast member, he had time to pursue other roles, which he did until December 1976, when he left for a starring role in the hit sitcom ''[[Three's Company]]'' (the Americanized version of the 1970s British [[Thames Television]] series ''[[Man About the House]]'') in 1977. In 1978, Ritter played [[Ringo Starr]]'s manager on the TV special ''[[Ringo (1978 film)|Ringo]]''. In 1982, Ritter provided the voice of Peter Dickinson in ''[[The Flight of Dragons]]''.\n\nRitter became a household name playing struggling culinary student [[Jack Tripper]] with two female roommates. Ritter co-starred opposite [[Joyce DeWitt]] and [[Suzanne Somers]], and then later [[Jenilee Harrison]] and [[Priscilla Barnes]]. Much of the comedy centered around Jack's pretending to be gay to keep the old-fashioned landlords appeased over the seemingly sordid living arrangements. The series spent several seasons near the top of the TV ratings in the U.S. before ending in 1984. A year-long spin-off ''[[Three's a Crowd]]'' ensued, as the Jack Tripper character has a live-in girlfriend and runs his own bistro. The original series has been seen continuously in reruns and is available on DVD. During the run of ''Three's Company'', Ritter appeared in the films ''[[Hero at Large]]'', ''[[Americathon]]'', and ''[[They All Laughed]]''. In 1986, he played the role of Dad in the music video for [[Graham Nash]]'s song \"Innocent Eyes\" from the [[Innocent Eyes (Graham Nash album)|album of the same name]].\n\n''[[Hooperman]]'' was Ritter's first regular television role after ''Three's Company''. Detective Harry Hooperman inherits a run-down apartment building and hires Susan Smith ([[Debrah Farentino]]) to run it. A relationship follows, and Hooperman must juggle work, love, and the antics of Bijoux the dog. In 1988, John was nominated for both an [[Emmy Award]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.emmys.com/celebrities/john-ritter |title=John Ritter Emmy Nominated |publisher=Emmys.com |date=September 12, 2003 |accessdate=December 12, 2014}}</ref> and a [[Golden Globe Award]] for his work on ''Hooperman''. Ritter won a [[People's Choice Awards|People's Choice Award]] for this role. From 1992 to 1995, Ritter returned to television for three seasons as John Hartman, aide to a U.S. Senator in ''[[Hearts Afire]]''. This series starred [[Markie Post]] as Georgie Anne Lahti and [[Billy Bob Thornton]] as Billy Bob Davis. He also played Garry Lejeune / Roger Tramplemain in the production ''Noises Off'' in 1992.\n\nAfter his time on television, he appeared in a number of movies, most notably ''[[Problem Child (film)|Problem Child]]'' and its [[Problem Child 2|first sequel]]. He played the lead role in [[Blake Edwards]]' 1989 film ''[[Skin Deep (1989 film)|Skin Deep]]'', appeared in the film version of ''[[Noises Off (film)|Noises Off]]'', rejoined Billy Bob Thornton in the [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]-winning ''[[Sling Blade]]'' (playing a kindhearted, gay, discount-store manager), and co-starred with [[Olivier Gruner]] in the 1996 action film ''Mercenary''. Ritter starred in many made-for-TV movies, including ''Gramps'' (1995), co-starring with [[Andy Griffith]], Rob Hedden's ''The Colony'' (1995) with [[Hal Linden]], [[Stephen King]]'s ''[[It (miniseries)|It]]'', ''Danielle Steel's Heartbeat'' with [[Polly Draper]], and ''[[It Came From the Sky (film)|It Came From the Sky]]'' in 1999 with [[Yasmine Bleeth]].\n\nRitter also made guest appearances on TV shows, such as ''[[Felicity (TV series)|Felicity]]'', ''[[Ally McBeal]],'' ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]],'' ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'', and an episode of ''[[Law & Order: SVU]]'' (2002). He also provided the voice of the [[Clifford (character)|title character]] in the animated children's show ''[[Clifford the Big Red Dog (TV series)|Clifford the Big Red Dog]]'', a role for which he received four [[Daytime Emmy Award|Emmy]] nominations. His final film was ''[[Stanley's Dinosaur Round-Up]]'' (2006), an animated direct-to-DVD film based on the television series, which was dedicated to his memory.\n\nAt the time of his death he was starring in ''[[8 Simple Rules|8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter]]''.\n\n===Theater===\nRitter played Claude Pichon in ''[[The Dinner Party (play)|The Dinner Party]]'' (2000) at the [[Music Box Theatre]] on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], which was written by [[Neil Simon]].

The purpose of the JRF is to provide accurate information to the general public about the disease and its risk factors, provide support to individuals who have thoracic aortic disease or have lost a loved one to the disease, and improve the identification of individuals at risk for aortic dissections and the treatment of thoracic aortic disease through medical research. Yasbeck worked with the [[University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston]] (UTHealth) to establish the John Ritter Research Program in Aortic and Vascular Diseases with the goal of preventing premature deaths due to aortic dissection by identifying genetic mutations that predispose individuals to thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections.\n\n==Filmography==\n\n===Film===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

The judges revealed three ingredients: black garlic, ginger and potatoes. Each team had to feature one of these ingredients in each course. Although the Blue Team's entree was delicious, its failure in the main and the dessert saw the Blue Team, led by Ben M., go to elimination. The Green Team, led by Amina, was thus advanced to the next challenge for an opportunity to win the single Weekly Immunity spot.\n| 1,094,000\n| 5\n| <ref>{{cite web|last=Knox|first=David|url=https://tvtonight.com.au/2020/04/tuesday-14-april-2020.html|title=Tuesday 14 April 2020|publisher=TV Tonight|date=15 April 2020|accessdate=15 April 2020}}</ref>\n|-\n| style=\"height:10px;\"| 3/01-3\n| Wednesday, 15 April 2020\n| '''Round Robin Relay Challenge''' - The 12 contestants from the Green Team were split into groups of three to compete in a relay-style cook-off, with every member spending 20 minutes each on the entree, main, and dessert.

Although the Orange Team, led by Simon, only consisted of seven people (one less than the other teams), they managed to nail every dish, leading to their win. The Purple and Yellow Teams, respectively led by Tracy and Laura, had their upsides and downsides. The Purple Team's donuts was fluffy, but their grilled corn lacked seasoning. The Yellow Team's donuts was delicious, but their meat had no flavor. On top of that, their chicken servings were inconsistent. Due to those downsides, Laura's Yellow Team found themselves facing elimination.\n| 916,000\n| 9\n| <ref>{{cite web|url=https://tvtonight.com.au/2020/04/monday-20-april-2020.html|title=Monday 20 April 2020|publisher=TV Tonight|first=David|last=Knox|date=21 April 2020|accessdate=21 April 2020}}</ref>\n|-\n| style=\"height:10px;\"| 7/02-2\n| Tuesday, 21 April 2020\n| '''Two-Round Pressure Test: Jock Zonfrillo''' - Jock's Orana-themed challenge required the Yellow Team to cook scarlet prawns, riberry crumpets, and bunya nut chawanmushi in 90 minutes.
