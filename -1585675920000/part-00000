Ramsay revisits the restaurant a few months later to see how business has fared in his absence. Episodes from series one and two have been re-edited with additional new material as ''Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares Revisited''; they featured Ramsay checking up on restaurants a year or more after he attended to them.\n\nAn American adaptation of this show, titled ''[[Kitchen Nightmares]]'', debuted 19 September 2007 on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]. It is broadcast in the UK on Channel 4 as ''Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares USA''. Its run ended on 12 September 2014.\n\nIn October 2009 Ramsay announced that after his four-year [[contract]] expired in 2011 he would not continue with ''Kitchen Nightmares'' and would instead work on his other shows. In June 2014, however, Ramsay announced that the UK version would return for four episodes after a seven-year hiatus.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2014/tv/news/gordon-ramsay-to-end-kitchen-nightmares-series-in-u-s-and-u-k-1201242302/|title=Gordon Ramsay to End \u2018Kitchen Nightmares\u2019 Series in U.S. and U.K.|first=Shelli|last=Weinstein|date=23 June 2014|website=Variety.com|accessdate=8 September 2018}}</ref> The show has won [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]] and [[Emmy Award|Emmy]] awards.\n\n==Series overview==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\" | Series\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" rowspan=\"2\" | Episodes\n! style=\"padding:0 80px;\" colspan=\"2\" | Originally aired\n|-\n!

Ramsay shows Tim how to buy cheaper produce from the [[Leeds Kirkgate Market]] and helps him make a meal for his family, though is still concerned when Tim botches the meal. Despite this, Tim is successfully able to serve a new bistro menu to nearly fifty guests on [[Valentine's Day]], leaving Ramsay hopeful for the restaurant's future.\n\nWhen Ramsay returns for a revisit a month later however, he finds the restaurant in an even worse state than when he first arrived; virtually no guests are booked for dinner, and the fridges and pantry are found to be full of rotting, mouldy food. Bonapartes' owner, Sue Ray, fires Tim and announces that she will close the restaurant and focus on running the upstairs bar, and Ramsay leaves, admitting failure.\n |LineColor       = e38181\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 2\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 2\n |Title           = The Glass House\n |Aux1            = [[Ambleside]], England\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2004|5|4|df=y}}\n |ShortSummary    = While Ramsay quickly sees the potential in the restaurant upon his arrival, due to the attractive building, excellent location and strong flow of tourists, he finds the actual food to be poor, which he blames on new owner Neil Farrell's inexperience and panicky nature, and head chef Richard Collins' lazy attitude, which hampers an otherwise-talented kitchen staff. Ramsay also finds the kitchen to be in a terrible state, and makes the staff join him in cleaning and repainting it. An initial failure to improve sees Richard come dangerously close to being fired, but he talks Neil into giving him one last chance, and Richard is able to improve and lead the kitchen through a service with a simplified, revamped menu.\n\nThe following month, Ramsay revisits the restaurant, and is pleased to see that they have further improved their menu and food, and that Neil and Richard are now getting along well.\n |LineColor       = e38181\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 3\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 3\n |Title           = [[The Walnut Tree (restaurant)|The Walnut Tree Inn]]\n |Aux1            = [[Llanddewi Skirrid]], Wales\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2004|5|11|df=y}}\n |ShortSummary    = Before visiting the inn, Ramsay discusses its history and the success it had under former owner Franco Taruschio, which has turned into financial difficulty under current owner Francesco Mattioli, something that has surprised Ramsay, given that the two were already acquainted from Francesco's career as a restaurant manager in London. However, Ramsay soon discovers exactly how bad things are; the restaurant is without a head chef, the food is very expensive and of poor quality (including a seafood stew being full of sand), and the locals have lost interest. Ramsay helps Francesco recruit a new head chef, Spencer Ralph, and create a more reasonably priced menu, before holding a special anniversary dinner to celebrate the inn's 40th anniversary, with Franco in attendance.\n\nWhen he returns for a revisit, Ramsay finds that the situation has improved somewhat; the food is definitely better, and the inn has more customers, but the prices are still very high. Before leaving, Ramsay re-iterates that Francesco has to lower prices if he wants to succeed.\n |LineColor       = e38181\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 4\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 4\n |Title           = Moore Place\n |Aux1            = [[Esher]], England\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2004|5|18|df=y}}\n |ShortSummary    = Despite the potential offered by the rich locals and the golf course next door to the restaurant, Ramsay finds it wasted by the building's terrible decor (including the exterior being entirely painted a claret shade), and the outdated menu that relies extensively on deep-fried food cooked in ageing, filthy equipment. The inexperience of owners Richard Hodgson and Nick Whitehouse also poses a major problem, as does the seeming indifference of much of the kitchen staff, especially head chef Mark Robinson, whose background is mostly in IT rather than cooking, and is berated by Ramsay for spending time golfing rather than cooking, which eventually leads to Ramsay destroying the kitchen's deep-fat fryers by throwing them into a water hazard on the course. Things begin to turn around when an experienced sous chef, Andy Trowell, is hired, and Ramsay gives him a burger recipe which he turns into the restaurant's new signature dish and introduces in a successful [[Mother's Day]] lunch.\n\nRamsay is dismayed to find that the building still has the same claret paint job when he returns for his revisit, but is otherwise pleased to find that Andy has been promoted to head chef (Mark is mentioned as having left to become a pub landlord), and that the restaurant attracts much more business.\n |LineColor       = e38181\n}}\n|}\n\n===Series 2: 2005===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width:98%; margin:auto; background:#fff;\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#e2a482; color:#000;\" width=7% | No.<br />overall\n! style=\"background:#e2a482; color:#000;\" width=7% | No. in<br />series\n! style=\"background:#e2a482; color:#000;\" width=40% | Restaurant\n! style=\"background:#e2a482; color:#000;\" width=20% | Location\n! style=\"background:#e2a482; color:#000;\" width=15% | Original air date\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 5\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 1\n |Title           = La Lanterna\n |Aux1            = [[Letchworth]], England\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2005|5|24|df=y}}\n |ShortSummary    = Ramsay meets Executive Chef Alex Scott in the kitchen, where he finds no authentic Italian ingredients, and too many precooked and prepackaged dishes. His meal consists of greasy minestrone soup, breadsticks in a paper package, and sausages on garlic bread that remind him of \"two poodles' penises doused in parsley\". In the walk-in, Ramsay finds old food, [[Pot Noodle]]s, and rotten vegetables. Worst of all, the kitchen and floor are filthy, with food debris everywhere (but amazingly, no rats or mice). Despite Alex losing 1,000 pounds per week, Ramsay opens his garage to find a brand new BMW with custom numberplates \u2013 \"A1 CHEF\". Ramsay discovers that Alex had spent \u00a348,000 on the car, and straight away sets off to sell both the car and the numberplate \u2013 calling a number of celebrity chefs about the latter, with amusing results. Ramsay teaches Gavin, the ineffectual manager, to be more authoritative \u2013 even roleplaying an uncooperative cook, to let Gavin tell him off. Ramsay also has the cooks engage in a pizza contest; which the sous chef, Aldona Novak, wins. This ignites some passion in her for food, where before she completely lacked it. Ramsay also updates the menu and the decor, bringing in paintings from a local art school. On reopening night, Alex starts to get overwhelmed and takes too long getting food out, but Gavin's newfound assertiveness saves the night.\n\nSix weeks later, Ramsay revisits La Lanterna and found that Alex has stuck to the changes \u2013 keeping the kitchen clean, serving fresh ingredients, and making homemade ravioli and desserts. Gavin has also continued to be a better manager. Alex is now making \u00a34,000 a week and has been able to pay down \u00a320,000 of debt, enough to start paying himself a salary.\n\n |LineColor       = e2a482\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 6\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 2\n |Title           = D-Place\n |Aux1            = [[Chelmsford]], England\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2005|5|31|df=y}}\n |ShortSummary    = While his biggest problem is with the restaurant's name, Ramsay finds that rookie owners Israel and Tara Pons are allowing themselves to be steamrollered by general manager Dave Bone, who Ramsay finds confrontational and ineffective, and head chef Philippe Blaise, who is vastly experienced and somewhat talented, but also arrogant and prone to taking shortcuts. Ramsay gets the owners to rename the restaurant as the Saracen's Caf\u00e9 Bar, after the hotel which the restaurant is situated in, and creates a better menu with a [[club sandwich]] as its centerpiece. While Philippe needs a lot of persuasion (and more than a little yelling) to fully embrace the new menu, Dave's inept handling of the reopening lunch service rapidly causes it to descend into chaos, leaving many guests without food. This causes Israel to finally run out of patience, and he fires Dave on the spot. Ramsay leaves with an uncertain outlook, noting that Israel and Tara are finally toughening up and Philippe's attitude seems a little better, but that it remains to be seen whether the changes will stick.\n\nOn his return, Ramsay discovers that Israel and Tara have been evicted from the restaurant by the building's owners, a decision they apparently made before Ramsay originally arrived in Chelmsford, and that the two are now in a dire financial situation. The restaurant is now closed and the lease up for sale. In the face of all this, Ramsay is shocked to find that Philippe was hired by the Saracen Hotel to head up their own kitchen, and has made the club sandwich into its signature dish. While this definitely was not the outcome Ramsay expected, he's happy to see that Philippe is at least maintaining high standards in his new job.\n |LineColor       = e2a482\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 7\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 3\n |Title           = Momma Cherri's Soul Food Shack\n |Aux1            = [[Brighton]], England\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2005|6|7|df=y}}\n |ShortSummary    = In a break from form, Ramsay declares that the restaurant's food is excellent, and easily the best he's had on the show so far.

With Ramsay's help, she adjusts to cooking all her food to order, and manages to pull in more customers. The kitchen staff initially finds it hard to adjust to the hugely increased custom, but soon adapt as the week goes on.\n\nIn his revisit two months later, Ramsay finds that the restaurant is still a success, Charita is focusing on running the front of house, and is also considering moving to a larger location to expand the potential of her business.\n |LineColor       = e2a482\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 8\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 4\n |Title           = La Riviera\n |Aux1            = [[Inverness]], Scotland\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2005|6|14|df=y}}\n |ShortSummary    = Ramsay has mixed feelings on the restaurant's food, noting that while head chef [[Lo\u00efc Lefebvre]]'s food is technically very proficient, it's overcomplicated, not cost-efficient, and would have limited appeal even in London or Edinburgh, to say nothing of Inverness. After helping Lo\u00efc and his team gain a better understanding of local culture by taking them to an [[Inverness Caledonian Thistle F.C.|Inverness Caledonian Thistle]] match and even getting them to wear [[kilt]]s for their reopening service, Gordon helps Lo\u00efc create a menu that's sophisticated, but also cost-effective and appealing to the locals.\n\nWhen he revisits the restaurant, owned by millionaire Barry Larson, Ramsay is pleased to see that Lo\u00efc has stuck with the new menu, and he is also impressed by a redesign of the restaurant.

However, Ramsay also finds head chef (and Maura's son) Lenin to be alarmingly inconsistent in terms of ability, and on further investigation finds that he's been drinking in service. Ramsay orders Lenin to stop, but the following night he gets a waitress to smuggle alcohol into the kitchen for him, further angering Ramsay. Events take a serious turn on the third night, when Lenin suddenly collapses in service and has to be rushed to hospital, where it's revealed that he's in the early stages of [[cirrhosis]]. This leads to Ramsay bringing in former chef and charity founder [[Michael Quinn (chef)|Michael Quinn]] to discuss the issue of alcoholism and drug abuse in the industry, and Michael tells Ramsay that Lenin must give up his job and enter rehab. In the meantime, Ramsay and sous chef Les manage a successful service with a new menu focused around Irish cuisine.\n\nWhen Ramsay revisits, he finds that the restaurant has a new head chef, and that Lenin is now only involved to hand over the reins before checking into rehab. More importantly, Lenin's cirrhosis was found to be treatable, and he's expected to make a full recovery. That night, Maura forces an unwilling Ramsay to engage in an Irish folk dance with her.\n |LineColor       = e3cd81\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 10\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 6\n |Title           = The Sandgate Hotel\n |Aux1            = [[Sandgate, Kent|Sandgate]], England\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2006|2|28|df=y}}\n |ShortSummary    = Upon visiting the Sandgate Hotel, Ramsay is immediately confused with the hotel's layout. There is a bar, a restaurant, and even a Japanese restaurant downstairs, all run from the same kitchen. To further complicate the experience, each has their own menu and diners cannot order from one menu without going to the other restaurant. Ramsay finds Stuart White, a gentle Geordie, in charge of the kitchen alongside his young inexperienced assistants. Ramsay identifies numerous issues: Stuart is clearly not comfortable cooking the bizarre range of food and has no experience in cooking Japanese food; he must leave the kitchen to his junior chefs while he runs the balcony grill; the orders are sent through an intercom system that disrupts the kitchen; the hotel staff spend too much time and money at their own bar (and in fact are inadvertently keeping the hotel afloat); and the number of managers causes confusion over who is in charge. Furthermore, during the week Stuart loses his [[The Automobile Association|AA rosette]], severely demoralising him. Despite these problems, Ramsay manages to set the restaurant on the right path by turning the Japanese restaurant into an exclusive dining area, focusing the menu on fresh seafood, and establishing more control over the front of house with owner Lois as the host.\n\nRamsay returns to find that turnover has doubled and while Stuart had not yet regained his AA rosette, he was relieved to find his morale and passion had improved.\n |LineColor       = e3cd81\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 11\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 7\n |Title           = Clubway 41\n |Aux1            = [[Blackpool]], England\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2006|3|7|df=y}}\n |ShortSummary    = Clubway 41 is run by Dave Jackson and his girlfriend Dawn Brindley, and is heavily promoted on the back of being named Blackpool Restaurant of the Year, but is struggling to attract customers. Ramsay finds that the upstairs restaurant is being kept afloat by the downstairs [[greasy spoon]] caf\u00e9. Dave's [[salmon]] with strawberry and mash with [[nectarine]]s are appalling to Ramsay. Dave has difficulty taking criticism from Ramsay and shows little proficiency for cooking, and even less familiarity with managing a kitchen, even with the downstairs cook Nigel Lloyd, who was more capable in handling the rush. Digging deeper, Ramsay discovers that no locals have heard of the award-winning Clubway 41 and obtains copies of the nomination forms, finding the reviews to be almost farcical. Identifying the difficulty with attracting customers to an upstairs restaurant, he takes a risk and turns the downstairs caf\u00e9 into the main attraction, focusing on simple English food. In the reopening, the restaurant is renamed ''Jacksons''. With Dave and Nigel in the kitchen, the service begins well, and while Nigel is a capable assistant, Dave continues to struggle with handling the workload.\n\nWhen Ramsay revisits, he finds a significant turn of events. A new bus stop was built in front of the restaurant, deterring customers from coming in. Nigel has left, leaving Dave in the kitchen, and the restaurant has reverted to its previous greasy spoon fare. Ramsay brings the owners out to Blackpool to do heavy promoting and places ads on the buses to help bring customers back.\n |LineColor       = e3cd81\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 12\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 8\n |Title           = La Gondola\n |Aux1            = [[Derby]], England\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2006|3|14|df=y}}\n |ShortSummary    = Daniela Bayfield has invested in a 40-year-old establishment and is hesitant to modernise, and relies on functions to sustain the restaurant rather than a steady customer base. Ramsay states that the restaurant is stuck in a time warp, with dishes and service reminiscent of the 70s and the dishes are severely underpriced, making a loss per sale. Head chef Steve Straughan lacks passion and is unused to busy sessions. During a birthday function, the kitchen uses canned tuna to substitute for tuna steaks, uses bought-in [[apple pie]] instead of making it, and mixes freshly made [[minestrone soup]] with packet soup to save costs. Steve struggles to maintain order in the kitchen during service without a clear system. Ramsay discards the complicated menu and devises a new, simpler menu and changes the decor in the dining room. He also brings back the [[flamb\u00e9]] table service as a hallmark of the restaurant. The dinner service proceeds well, though Steve still has difficulty communicating with the team.\n\nWhen Ramsay revisits, he discovers that Steve has moved on and Daniela has gone through several chefs before hiring a new one.\n |LineColor       = e3cd81\n}}\n|}\n\n===Series 3: 2006===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width:98%; margin:auto; background:#fff;\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#b4e381; color:#000;\" width=7% | No.<br />overall\n! style=\"background:#b4e381; color:#000;\" width=7% | No. in<br />series\n! style=\"background:#b4e381; color:#000;\" width=40% | Restaurant\n! style=\"background:#b4e381; color:#000;\" width=20% | Location\n! style=\"background:#b4e381; color:#000;\" width=15% | Original air date\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 13\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 1\n |Title           = La Parra de Burriana\n |Aux1            = [[Nerja]], [[Spain]]\n |OriginalAirDate = \n |ShortSummary    = Laurence Davy runs a restaurant in an ideal Spanish holiday location, but has difficulty attracting locals. Ramsay discovers a menu that encompasses numerous cuisines and appalling recipes, such as [[prawn]]s with chocolate sauce and chicken with banana. Poor service and improperly cooked food have given the restaurant a negative reputation. To show the staff the importance of letting ingredients speak for themselves, he creates smoothies from the menu items, including the prawns with chocolate, with Lawrence being unable to identify the prawns. Ramsay creates a simple menu for the night's service, but Lawrence insists that he is in control of his large, unpopular menu and only switches to Ramsay's backup menu after it is too late. To make things worse, the restaurant is robbed during the night, with the thieves taking money from the takings stored in a filing cabinets. Ramsay takes Laurence to a [[bullfighting]] school to demonstrate the importance of listening to expert advice. He also berates Laurence over his excessive use of his [[flattop grill|plancha grill]], causing food to be overcooked and taste monotonous, and teaches him to cook fresh food in pans. The final service begins well, but the staff have double-booked tables, causing confusion in the kitchen and ruining a nearly flawless reopening. Ramsay leaves, concerned that the restaurant would not make it through the slower winter season.\n\nWhen Ramsay revisits, he finds that the restaurant is doing well, and Laurence has ceased using the grill.

At 62 years of age, Brian (and his wife, Elaine Howden) are working between 100 and 120 hours a week and his age and health create disorder in kitchen as he is unable to keep track of orders. Ramsay also finds that Brian is a [[compulsive hoarding|compulsive hoarder]], collecting a bizarre collection of [[crockery]] from [[eBay]]. To address the problems, Ramsay removes Brian from the kitchen and moves him to the front of house. However, Brian is unable to fully remove himself from his duties and creates another batch of terrible sauce. Ramsay throws the sauce out and gets Brian to begin selling his excessive plate collection. He turns Brian over to a simpler menu, focusing on classic pub dishes instead of pretending to be a restaurant, and to complement the excellent [[Yorkshire pudding]], Ramsay creates a new focus and campaign for the pub to bring back real [[gravy]]. Brian is enthusiastic about the idea and the staff market their new gravy in town. Despite some confusion in the service, the kitchen staff hold up under pressure and the customers are pleased with the new food. Ramsay leaves after making Brian promise not to step back into the kitchen.\n\nDuring his revisit, Ramsay is shocked to learn that Brian has returned to the kitchen. The kitchen staff have been left shorthanded and he is filling in until they can employ a new chef, and subsequently he has begun reverting to some of his old habits.

After speaking to the locals and finding out about the Rococo's abysmal reputation, Ramsay tells Nick that there's no way he can salvage things as they are, and that the only way to recover is to effectively start over with a new restaurant in the same building. Nick agrees, and Rococo is renamed '''Maggie's''', given a complete makeover and refit, and a new menu focused around local seafood.\n\nWhen he revisits, Ramsay is happy to find that Nick has embraced the restaurant's new identity, and has finally shaken off his ghosts of the past.\n |LineColor       = b4e381\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 16\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 4\n |Title           = Morgans\n |Aux1            = [[Liverpool]], England\n |OriginalAirDate = \n |ShortSummary    = Ramsay has major issues with the food, but finds the biggest problem to be the feuds among the owners and staff; owner Sandy Morgan has little knowledge of restaurants and insists on personally buying all the ingredients from a nearby supermarket, younger daughter Laura Kelly has even less, elder daughter Helen Kelly has the most business knowledge but only works at the restaurant part-time, head chef Philip Lee has a confrontational attitude, uses bizarre combinations (such as mashed potatoes and apricot) in the menu and doesn't get on with sous chef Emma, who nonetheless serves Ramsay the only thing he likes, a [[sticky toffee pudding]]. Ramsay finds it hard going, and the continued feuds cause Laura to temporarily walk away from the restaurant, but with Helen committing to the restaurant full-time and Phil agreeing to work more with Emma and simplifying the menu, things begin to look up.\n\nWhen he revisits, Ramsay finds the restaurant running much better, thanks to Helen handling the business aspects and Sandy focusing on hospitality. Most significantly however, it's revealed that just a week after Ramsay left, Sandy decided to promote Emma to head chef and gave Phil an ultimatum to accept demotion to sous chef or be fired, which resulted in him quitting.

On sampling the food, Ramsay realises that the restaurant's fish is too expensive and sub-standard, and on taking Alex and Jamie to a local fish market finds that [[pollock]] is in plentiful local supply. A revamped menu with a pollock fish and chips meal proves a hit, but things nearly stall when Ramsay clashes with Allan over the restaurant's gaudy decor, which Allan is proud of and threatens to stop filming if Ramsay attempts to change it. Despite this, Allan eventually agrees to allow a makeover, and Ramsay also has the restaurant renamed '''Love's Fish Restaurant''' so as to take advantage of its biggest asset, Allan himself. Jamie is designated head chef, and the full reopening proves a big hit.\n\nTwo months later, Ramsay returns to Brighton and covertly orders a takeaway, under the name of \"Jimmy\", in a Scottish accent.

Ramsay also strongly criticizes the work ethic and competence of head chef Toby, and is infuriated to discover the kitchen is full of old food and filthy, rusting equipment, which he orders to be replaced. However, Ramsay suspects that the kitchen staff are merely demotivated due to the unchanging menu, and sets up a new grill menu, only for Toby to turn out to be even worse at cooking that than he was the carvery. Ramsay's patience with Toby runs out, and he orders the restaurant's general manager Matt, himself an experienced chef, to take over from Toby, who is demoted to sous chef. This change in roles finally gets things moving, and under Matt's leadership the kitchen finally gets through a service.\n\nIn the revisit, Ramsay is happy to see that Matt is still heading up the kitchen and that Toby has been fired for serving expired chicken, but alarmed to find that Scott has refused to fully commit to the new menu, and is only running it on weekdays, with the carvery still running at weekends. He therefore gets Scott and the staff to run an advertising campaign for the new menu in the town center.\n |LineColor       = 81e393\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 25\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 3\n |Title           = Curry Lounge\n |Aux1            = [[Nottingham]], England\n |OriginalAirDate = \n |ShortSummary    = Ramsay is initially displeased with the restaurant's atmosphere and misleading claims of being Nottingham's best restaurant (with \"Runners-Up\" in small print). While owner Arfan \"Raz\" Razak proudly boasts that his \"make your own curry\" idea is what sets his restaurant apart, Ramsay tells him that it's actually ensuring the business will fail, as the kitchen staff have to buy huge numbers of ingredients to make all the curries on the menu, and none of them taste especially nice and not even the restaurant staff can taste the difference. At Ramsay's urging, head chef Khan puts a lamb [[korma]] made from a family recipe on the menu for the second night's service, which proves a big hit and wins Raz over.

Originally intended as an exclusive club for the rich and famous, Nigel has had to rebrand the restaurant, which now struggles to pull customers and has a poor reputation with the locals for its exclusive impression. Ramsay and Nigel eat lunch together, where it becomes clear that the restaurant does not live up to its focus of modern British food, with too many exotic dishes on the menu, such as shark with mozzarella, that the kitchen staff struggle to cook. The kitchen is run by Martin, who has taken on board two delinquent boys to help them back on track with cooking. Ramsay books the restaurant to half capacity for lunch to test the kitchen, but unused to even these numbers, the staff struggle to keep up. Ramsay identifies the main weakness to be Nigel, who has no experience as a restaurant manager, lacks control over the dining room and has difficulty accepting criticism. This is demonstrated when Nigel struggles to delegate tasks to his staff when challenged to put together a prefabricated chicken coop. After convincing Nigel to turn to a simpler British menu and allowing Martin to have more control, the staff host a food fair to bring the community back. The reopening begins well, but Martin struggles with the numbers and fails to show strong leadership under pressure. The kitchen staff lose discipline, although young cook Pete is able to hold himself together. The service is disappointing, with Martin disappointed with himself and Nigel determined to get it right.\n\nRevisiting the restaurant, Ramsay is pleased to find the restaurant is maintaining a steady flow of customers.

Ramsay learns that Mike, while passionate and ambitious, is not a trained chef and has based his menu on cookbooks written by celebrity chefs such as [[Jamie Oliver]], [[Rick Stein]] and Gordon Ramsay himself. Ramsay is critical of the menu's complexity and lack of focus, and his concerns are proven in the evening service. As the cookbooks are written for home cooking, the dishes are too complex to manage in a busy restaurant environment and Mike does not know how to handle multiple orders. Half the customers are not served food, and Caron verbally confronts and kicks out several customers. The next day, Ramsay gets rid of Mike's cookbooks and removes the exotic dishes from the menu. He appeals to Mike's proud Italian heritage and creates an authentic [[meatball]] item. Mike is capable of handling the orders in the following service with praise for the food, but the night is ruined when Caron forgets an order and throws a tantrum. Ramsay manages to help the couple ease the tension and work together. They go into town to promote their new menu and service. Before the service, Ramsay sets up a punching bag outside to get the couple to vent their anger. The restaurant is packed, and Caron proves to have overcome her temper issues. However, Mike's inexperience in managing a full dining room causes him to fall behind. The service is stopped when one of the waitresses slips and falls, being knocked unconscious and taken to hospital.\n\nWhen Ramsay revisits, he finds that Mike has changed the ugly blue paint to a pleasing white. Business has doubled and Caron and Mike no longer argue. To verify this, Ramsay calls up recent customers, who confirm their positive experience. He parts ways with the couple and gifts them with their own empty cookbook, and tells Mike to fill it with his own recipes.\n |LineColor       = 81e393\n}}\n\n|}\n\n===Series 5: 2007===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width:98%; margin:auto; background:#fff;\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#81e393; color:#000;\" width=7% | No.<br />overall\n! style=\"background:#81e393; color:#000;\" width=7% | No. in<br />series\n! style=\"background:#81e393; color:#000;\" width=40% | Restaurant\n! style=\"background:#81e393; color:#000;\" width=20% | Location\n! style=\"background:#81e393; color:#000;\" width=15% | Original air date\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = \n |EpisodeNumber2  = 1\n |Title           = The Glass House\n |Aux1            = [[Ambleside]], England\n |OriginalAirDate = \n |ShortSummary    = \"Revisited\" episode\n\nAfter recapping the original episode, Ramsay returns to the Glass House for a second time, and is happy to see standards mostly being maintained, though he takes the time to criticize Richard for allowing standards to slip a little in certain areas. Fortunately, Richard quickly corrects this. It's noted that a few members in the kitchen team have changed; in particular, two of them have been hired by Ramsay himself to work at his restaurants.\n |LineColor       = e2a482\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = \n |EpisodeNumber2  = 2\n |Title           = The Walnut Tree Inn\n |Aux1            = Llandewi Skirrid, Wales\n |OriginalAirDate = \n |ShortSummary    = \"Revisited\" episode\n\nWhile the overall standard of food has been broadly maintained as of his second revisit, Ramsay is dismayed to find that the number of customers has dropped to its lowest-ever number, and that Francesco is still charging extremely high prices that, on average, are in excess of \u00a360 for an entr\u00e9e alone. After speaking to the locals and finding out that those who've visited the inn have enjoyed the food but not felt it to be worth the price, Ramsay creates a new dish that can be sold for half the price of the existing items and still be very profitable. However, Francesco is adamant that his approach is correct, and openly says that he would rather see the inn go out of business than make prices as cheap as Ramsay is suggesting. Ramsay gives up, tells Francesco that the inn ''will'' close if he maintains his current approach, and leaves.\n |LineColor       = e2a482\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = \n |EpisodeNumber2  = 3\n |Title           = Moore Place\n |Aux1            = Esher, England\n |OriginalAirDate = \n |ShortSummary    = \"Revisited\" episode\nRamsey revisits the establishment and is shocked to see that the building has still not be repainted, despite this being one of the primary complaints from the locals. He however finds solace in the fact that the positive changes to the menu have appeared to work and Moore Place is seeing better business. He makes a final suggestion to improve the lunch time trade by bringing the bar menu inline with the main restaurant, and pulls a stunt of throwing their deep fat fryer into a pond to prevent them from making cheap deep-fried food for good.\n |LineColor       = e2a482\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = \n |EpisodeNumber2  = 4\n |Title           = Bonapartes Restaurant\n |Aux1            = [[Silsden]], England\n |OriginalAirDate = \n |ShortSummary    = \"Revisited\" episode\n\nAs of Ramsay's second revisit, Bonaparte's has closed altogether, and is up for sale. More importantly Ramsay reveals that Sue, who refuses to be interviewed in the episode, has made several allegations about Ramsay and the show through the press (including an accusation that Tim was actually an actor hired by the producers, who duped Sue into believing he was a chef and then deliberately did the worst job possible in order to make the restaurant and Sue look bad) and is considering a lawsuit against both (though she ultimately did not go through with one). Ramsay also catches up with Tim, who has decided to change careers completely and happily pursuing work in television as a runner, though is dismayed to find that, like in the original episode, Tim still can't successfully cook an [[omelette]].\n |LineColor       = e2a482\n}}\n|}\n\n===Great British Nightmare===\nA one-off special entitled ''Ramsay's Great British Nightmare'' aired on Channel 4 on 30 January 2009 as part of 'The Great British Food Fight', a two-week series of food-related programming. In the programme, Ramsay campaigned for viewers to start supporting local restaurants, especially in a bad economy.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width:98%; margin:auto; background:#fff;\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#81e3d4; color:#000;\" width=7% | No.<br />overall\n! style=\"background:#81e3d4; color:#000;\" width=7% | No. in<br />series\n! style=\"background:#81e3d4; color:#000;\" width=40% | Restaurant\n! style=\"background:#81e3d4; color:#000;\" width=20% | Location\n! style=\"background:#81e3d4; color:#000;\" width=15% | Original air date\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 31\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 1\n |Title           = The Dovecote Bistro\n |Aux1            = [[Devon]], England\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2009|1|30|df=y}}\n |ShortSummary    =  Mick is a former truck driver and burger van operator who has opened a bistro with his wife and adopted daughter, Michelle. Ramsay is firstly appalled by the psychedelic wallpaper. While Ramsay is impressed with the simple menu, he is furious to find that Mick has very little cooking ability, using [[Squash (drink)|orange squash]] to make a sauce and using vacuum-sealed pre-cooked [[lamb shank]]s in a microwave bag. Not only does he show little responsibility in the kitchen, he is also secretive with his spending and is hugely in debt. Mick is adamant that the problems in the kitchen are not his fault, and his stubbornness causes a rift with his wife and daughter. Ramsay solves the crisis by taking the business matters out of Mick's hands and kicks him out of the kitchen. His daughter, Michelle, is placed in charge of the kitchen despite having no cooking experience. She rises to the challenge, and while Mick is not convinced over replacing his microwave food, the reopening is a success.\n\nMonths later, Ramsay returns to find that the restaurant is making profit. He sent Michelle for further culinary training, and she impresses Ramsay with freshly cooked food.\n\nThe restaurant was renamed ''Martins' Bistro'' during production.\n |LineColor       = 81e3d4\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 32\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 2\n |Title           = The Runaway Girl\n |Aux1            = [[Sheffield]], England\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2009|1|30|df=y}}\n |ShortSummary    = Justin runs The Runaway Girl, specialising in Spanish [[tapas]], with best friend and head chef, Richie. Ramsay is not impressed with the decor, finding the name and appearance to be similar to a [[strip club]]. He discovers that the kitchen does no preparation work before service, as Richie has pre-cooked and stored all the meals in advance to prevent wastage. He discovers that Justin invests very little in the kitchen and focuses on organising live music events, which customers find loud and obnoxious. Richie and Justin fall out, with Richie launching a heated tirade about Justin's inability to listen to criticism. Ramsay employs a [[mystery shopping|mystery diner]] to assess the service, and despite Justin claiming to recognise their purpose, botches the service and forgets to even provide cutlery, resulting in a scathing review. After helping Justin and Richie make amends, he refurbishes the restaurant and renames it ''Silversmiths'', bans live music and, realising that they have no chance of competing against local Spanish restaurants, changes the focus to modern British cuisine.\n\nBefore Ramsay's revisit, he sends another mystery diner to the restaurant, who gives a positive assessment of the service. He is pleased that Justin has stuck to the changes, and is impressed that Richie has found a new passion for food.\n |LineColor       = 81e3d4\n}}\n|}\n\n===Costa del Nightmares===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width:98%; margin:auto; background:#fff;\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#ffd3d4; color:#000;\" width=7% | No.<br />overall\n! style=\"background:#ffd3d4; color:#000;\" width=7% | No. in<br />series\n! style=\"background:#ffd3d4; color:#000;\" width=40% | Restaurant\n! style=\"background:#ffd3d4; color:#000;\" width=20% | Location\n! style=\"background:#ffd3d4; color:#000;\" width=15% | Original air date\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 33\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 1\n |Title           = Mayfair Restaurante\n |Aux1            = [[Fuengirola]], Spain\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2014|9|23|df=y}}\n |ShortSummary    = While previously successful, the Mayfair has fallen on hard times, which Ramsay attributes to owner Jack's refusal to fire head chef Juan, awful hygiene standards (which results in Ramsay closing the restaurant down for the first day for an extensive cleaning), and insistence on filling much of the restaurant with useless junk. Ramsay initially sees Jack's son John as the right man to take over, but quickly loses faith on finding out that not only has the car hire business that John runs separately been a huge failure, he's invested \u20ac40,000 of his parents' money into it too. After forcing John to promise to shut down his hire business and eventually repay his parents, and getting Jack to get rid of his hoard, Ramsay renames the restaurant '''Jack's Chicken Shack''' and creates a new menu focused around fried chicken. The service that follows initially goes poorly thanks to John's poor handling of the order system, but he eventually gets the hang of it, and service is successfully completed.\n\nIn his revisit, Ramsay is encouraged to find that the restaurant is still busy, Juan has been moved to barkeeping duties and replaced by a younger chef (also called Juan), and cleanliness standards have been maintained. However, he makes John write an IOU to his parents when he reveals that he hasn't paid them back any money yet.\n |LineColor       = ffd3d4\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 34\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 2\n |Title           = Le Deck\n |Aux1            = [[Capbreton]], France\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2014|9|30|df=y}}\n |ShortSummary    = As soon as he arrives at the restaurant, Ramsay is outraged by head chef Steve and the staff cooking themselves a sirloin dinner, and accuses them of taking advantage of owners Tim and Debbie. However, Tim is discovered to be a big part of the problem due to his interference in service, refusal to allow Steve to set his own menu, and careless handling of the business side of the restaurant. While Ramsay has further criticism for Steve's lack of local product knowledge and not even being able to speak French, he and the kitchen staff prove their skill by cooking good dishes after Ramsay takes them to a local seafood market, only for Tim to berate the staff when he sees the results, accusing them of holding back and even threatening to fire them. Despite this, the reopening night goes well, and Ramsay tells Tim that so long as he doesn't interfere with the running of the kitchen, he can make Le Deck a success.\n\nNo revisit is shown in the episode, though an epilogue caption reveals that the restaurant is still doing well, while Steve has left and returned to the mountain resort where he previously worked, leaving sous chef Stuey to take over as head chef.\n |LineColor       = ffd3d4\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 35\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 3\n |Title           = La Granada Divino\n |Aux1            = [[Gauc\u00edn]], Spain\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2014|10|7|df=y}}\n |ShortSummary    = In a Kitchen Nightmares first, Ramsay works with a restaurant that has opened only 8 weeks prior to his arrival. Owners Milan and Gina are new to the restaurant industry and their inexperience leads them to lean on head chef Neal to manage the restaurant as well as run the kitchen, putting heavy pressure on Neal. Ramsay notes that the restaurant\u2019s menu is too complicated for a small brigade and discovers Neal fails to delegate to his assistant chefs, which heavily slows down service and causes Neal to be extremely stressed while cooking.\n\nIn order to demonstrate the difficulty that Neal and the servers are under, Ramsay has Milan and Gina work a service with only six guests, which forces them to see the negative impact of decisions they had made, like the broken dumbwaiter and the complicated menu. He also implements a new menu around sharing plates, which takes pressure off the kitchen. During the relaunch, the service initially starts off very strong. However, when the sharing plates run out, Neal buckles under pressure and reverts to his bad habits. Fortunately, Ramsay is able to get Neal back on track, saving the service and impressing a local food critic.\n\nNo revisit is shown in the episode, but it is said that the restaurant is taking in 5,000 pounds a week, Neal and Emily are managing the restaurant, and the owners have taken a step back.\n\n |LineColor       = ffd3d4\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 36\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 4\n |Title           = Quelcuttis\n |Aux1            = [[Els Poblets]], Spain\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2014|10|14|df=y}}\n |ShortSummary    = Initially, Ramsay is put off by the fact that siblings Joe and Terry Quelcutti seem more interested in running the establishment as a bar rather than a restaurant, which has caused chef Terry\u2019s food to be abysmal. However, he identifies a bigger problem: server Joe\u2019s inability to keep cool during service leads him to regularly confront guests he\u2019s meant to be serving. In order to improve the siblings\u2019 abilities in the front and back of house, Ramsay has them work a lunch service at Quique De Costa, a Michelin-starred restaurant in the area.\n\nRamsay relaunches the restaurant as '''Quelcutti\u2019s Tapas''' with a menu focused on Spanish tapas and quality wine. During service, Joe\u2019s panicky nature initially causes him to take too many food orders and get short with Ramsay; fortunately, Joe is able to regain his rhythm and the service ends well. Upon revisit, Ramsay returns to find the restaurant is making money and the siblings are finally able to pay themselves a wage.\n\n |LineColor       = ffd3d4\n}}\n|}\n\n==Libel==\nIn June 2006, Ramsay won a [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] case against the ''[[Evening Standard]]'', which had alleged that scenes and the general condition of the restaurant had been faked for the first episode of ''Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares''. These allegations followed reports from the previous owner of Bonapartes, Sue Ray.

Nightmares''''' is a television programme featuring British celebrity chef [[Gordon Ramsay]] first broadcast on  [[Channel 4]] in 2004.\n\nIn each episode, Ramsay visits a failing restaurant and acts as a [[Troubleshooting|troubleshooter]] to help improve the establishment in just one week.  Ramsay revisits the restaurant a few months later to see how business has fared in his absence. Episodes from series one and two have been re-edited with additional new material as ''Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares Revisited''; they featured Ramsay checking up on restaurants a year or more after he attended to them.\n\nAn American adaptation of this show, titled ''[[Kitchen Nightmares]]'', debuted 19 September 2007 on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]. It is broadcast in the UK on Channel 4 as ''Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares USA''. Its run ended on 12 September 2014.\n\nIn October 2009 Ramsay announced that after his four-year [[contract]] expired in 2011 he would not continue with ''Kitchen Nightmares'' and would instead work on his other shows. In June 2014, however, Ramsay announced that the UK version would return for four episodes after a seven-year hiatus.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2014/tv/news/gordon-ramsay-to-end-kitchen-nightmares-series-in-u-s-and-u-k-1201242302/|title=Gordon Ramsay to End \u2018Kitchen Nightmares\u2019 Series in U.S. and U.K.|first=Shelli|last=Weinstein|date=23 June 2014|website=Variety.com|accessdate=8 September 2018}}</ref> The show has won [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]] and [[Emmy Award|Emmy]] awards.\n\n==Series overview==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\" | Series\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" rowspan=\"2\" | Episodes\n! style=\"padding:0 80px;\" colspan=\"2\" | Originally aired\n|-\n!

Ramsay shows Tim how to buy cheaper produce from the [[Leeds Kirkgate Market]] and helps him make a meal for his family, though is still concerned when Tim botches the meal. Despite this, Tim is successfully able to serve a new bistro menu to nearly fifty guests on [[Valentine's Day]], leaving Ramsay hopeful for the restaurant's future.\n\nWhen Ramsay returns for a revisit a month later however, he finds the restaurant in an even worse state than when he first arrived; virtually no guests are booked for dinner, and the fridges and pantry are found to be full of rotting, mouldy food. Bonapartes' owner, Sue Ray, fires Tim and announces that she will close the restaurant and focus on running the upstairs bar, and Ramsay leaves, admitting failure.\n |LineColor       = e38181\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 2\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 2\n |Title           = The Glass House\n |Aux1            = [[Ambleside]], England\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2004|5|4|df=y}}\n |ShortSummary    = While Ramsay quickly sees the potential in the restaurant upon his arrival, due to the attractive building, excellent location and strong flow of tourists, he finds the actual food to be poor, which he blames on new owner Neil Farrell's inexperience and panicky nature, and head chef Richard Collins' lazy attitude, which hampers an otherwise-talented kitchen staff. Ramsay also finds the kitchen to be in a terrible state, and makes the staff join him in cleaning and repainting it. An initial failure to improve sees Richard come dangerously close to being fired, but he talks Neil into giving him one last chance, and Richard is able to improve and lead the kitchen through a service with a simplified, revamped menu.\n\nThe following month, Ramsay revisits the restaurant, and is pleased to see that they have further improved their menu and food, and that Neil and Richard are now getting along well.\n |LineColor       = e38181\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 3\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 3\n |Title           = [[The Walnut Tree (restaurant)|The Walnut Tree Inn]]\n |Aux1            = [[Llanddewi Skirrid]], Wales\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2004|5|11|df=y}}\n |ShortSummary    = Before visiting the inn, Ramsay discusses its history and the success it had under former owner Franco Taruschio, which has turned into financial difficulty under current owner Francesco Mattioli, something that has surprised Ramsay, given that the two were already acquainted from Francesco's career as a restaurant manager in London. However, Ramsay soon discovers exactly how bad things are; the restaurant is without a head chef, the food is very expensive and of poor quality (including a seafood stew being full of sand), and the locals have lost interest. Ramsay helps Francesco recruit a new head chef, Spencer Ralph, and create a more reasonably priced menu, before holding a special anniversary dinner to celebrate the inn's 40th anniversary, with Franco in attendance.\n\nWhen he returns for a revisit, Ramsay finds that the situation has improved somewhat; the food is definitely better, and the inn has more customers, but the prices are still very high.

The inexperience of owners Richard Hodgson and Nick Whitehouse also poses a major problem, as does the seeming indifference of much of the kitchen staff, especially head chef Mark Robinson, whose background is mostly in IT rather than cooking, and is berated by Ramsay for spending time golfing rather than cooking, which eventually leads to Ramsay destroying the kitchen's deep-fat fryers by throwing them into a water hazard on the course. Things begin to turn around when an experienced sous chef, Andy Trowell, is hired, and Ramsay gives him a burger recipe which he turns into the restaurant's new signature dish and introduces in a successful [[Mother's Day]] lunch.\n\nRamsay is dismayed to find that the building still has the same claret paint job when he returns for his revisit, but is otherwise pleased to find that Andy has been promoted to head chef (Mark is mentioned as having left to become a pub landlord), and that the restaurant attracts much more business.\n |LineColor       = e38181\n}}\n|}\n\n===Series 2: 2005===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width:98%; margin:auto; background:#fff;\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#e2a482; color:#000;\" width=7% | No.<br />overall\n! style=\"background:#e2a482; color:#000;\" width=7% | No. in<br />series\n! style=\"background:#e2a482; color:#000;\" width=40% | Restaurant\n! style=\"background:#e2a482; color:#000;\" width=20% | Location\n! style=\"background:#e2a482; color:#000;\" width=15% | Original air date\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 5\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 1\n |Title           = La Lanterna\n |Aux1            = [[Letchworth]], England\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2005|5|24|df=y}}\n |ShortSummary    = Ramsay meets Executive Chef Alex Scott in the kitchen, where he finds no authentic Italian ingredients, and too many precooked and prepackaged dishes. His meal consists of greasy minestrone soup, breadsticks in a paper package, and sausages on garlic bread that remind him of \"two poodles' penises doused in parsley\". In the walk-in, Ramsay finds old food, [[Pot Noodle]]s, and rotten vegetables. Worst of all, the kitchen and floor are filthy, with food debris everywhere (but amazingly, no rats or mice). Despite Alex losing 1,000 pounds per week, Ramsay opens his garage to find a brand new BMW with custom numberplates \u2013 \"A1 CHEF\". Ramsay discovers that Alex had spent \u00a348,000 on the car, and straight away sets off to sell both the car and the numberplate \u2013 calling a number of celebrity chefs about the latter, with amusing results. Ramsay teaches Gavin, the ineffectual manager, to be more authoritative \u2013 even roleplaying an uncooperative cook, to let Gavin tell him off. Ramsay also has the cooks engage in a pizza contest; which the sous chef, Aldona Novak, wins. This ignites some passion in her for food, where before she completely lacked it. Ramsay also updates the menu and the decor, bringing in paintings from a local art school. On reopening night, Alex starts to get overwhelmed and takes too long getting food out, but Gavin's newfound assertiveness saves the night.\n\nSix weeks later, Ramsay revisits La Lanterna and found that Alex has stuck to the changes \u2013 keeping the kitchen clean, serving fresh ingredients, and making homemade ravioli and desserts. Gavin has also continued to be a better manager. Alex is now making \u00a34,000 a week and has been able to pay down \u00a320,000 of debt, enough to start paying himself a salary.\n\n |LineColor       = e2a482\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 6\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 2\n |Title           = D-Place\n |Aux1            = [[Chelmsford]], England\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2005|5|31|df=y}}\n |ShortSummary    = While his biggest problem is with the restaurant's name, Ramsay finds that rookie owners Israel and Tara Pons are allowing themselves to be steamrollered by general manager Dave Bone, who Ramsay finds confrontational and ineffective, and head chef Philippe Blaise, who is vastly experienced and somewhat talented, but also arrogant and prone to taking shortcuts. Ramsay gets the owners to rename the restaurant as the Saracen's Caf\u00e9 Bar, after the hotel which the restaurant is situated in, and creates a better menu with a [[club sandwich]] as its centerpiece. While Philippe needs a lot of persuasion (and more than a little yelling) to fully embrace the new menu, Dave's inept handling of the reopening lunch service rapidly causes it to descend into chaos, leaving many guests without food. This causes Israel to finally run out of patience, and he fires Dave on the spot. Ramsay leaves with an uncertain outlook, noting that Israel and Tara are finally toughening up and Philippe's attitude seems a little better, but that it remains to be seen whether the changes will stick.\n\nOn his return, Ramsay discovers that Israel and Tara have been evicted from the restaurant by the building's owners, a decision they apparently made before Ramsay originally arrived in Chelmsford, and that the two are now in a dire financial situation. The restaurant is now closed and the lease up for sale. In the face of all this, Ramsay is shocked to find that Philippe was hired by the Saracen Hotel to head up their own kitchen, and has made the club sandwich into its signature dish. While this definitely was not the outcome Ramsay expected, he's happy to see that Philippe is at least maintaining high standards in his new job.\n |LineColor       = e2a482\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 7\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 3\n |Title           = Momma Cherri's Soul Food Shack\n |Aux1            = [[Brighton]], England\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2005|6|7|df=y}}\n |ShortSummary    = In a break from form, Ramsay declares that the restaurant's food is excellent, and easily the best he's had on the show so far.

With Ramsay's help, she adjusts to cooking all her food to order, and manages to pull in more customers. The kitchen staff initially finds it hard to adjust to the hugely increased custom, but soon adapt as the week goes on.\n\nIn his revisit two months later, Ramsay finds that the restaurant is still a success, Charita is focusing on running the front of house, and is also considering moving to a larger location to expand the potential of her business.\n |LineColor       = e2a482\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 8\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 4\n |Title           = La Riviera\n |Aux1            = [[Inverness]], Scotland\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2005|6|14|df=y}}\n |ShortSummary    = Ramsay has mixed feelings on the restaurant's food, noting that while head chef [[Lo\u00efc Lefebvre]]'s food is technically very proficient, it's overcomplicated, not cost-efficient, and would have limited appeal even in London or Edinburgh, to say nothing of Inverness. After helping Lo\u00efc and his team gain a better understanding of local culture by taking them to an [[Inverness Caledonian Thistle F.C.|Inverness Caledonian Thistle]] match and even getting them to wear [[kilt]]s for their reopening service, Gordon helps Lo\u00efc create a menu that's sophisticated, but also cost-effective and appealing to the locals.\n\nWhen he revisits the restaurant, owned by millionaire Barry Larson, Ramsay is pleased to see that Lo\u00efc has stuck with the new menu, and he is also impressed by a redesign of the restaurant.

However, Ramsay also finds head chef (and Maura's son) Lenin to be alarmingly inconsistent in terms of ability, and on further investigation finds that he's been drinking in service. Ramsay orders Lenin to stop, but the following night he gets a waitress to smuggle alcohol into the kitchen for him, further angering Ramsay. Events take a serious turn on the third night, when Lenin suddenly collapses in service and has to be rushed to hospital, where it's revealed that he's in the early stages of [[cirrhosis]]. This leads to Ramsay bringing in former chef and charity founder [[Michael Quinn (chef)|Michael Quinn]] to discuss the issue of alcoholism and drug abuse in the industry, and Michael tells Ramsay that Lenin must give up his job and enter rehab. In the meantime, Ramsay and sous chef Les manage a successful service with a new menu focused around Irish cuisine.\n\nWhen Ramsay revisits, he finds that the restaurant has a new head chef, and that Lenin is now only involved to hand over the reins before checking into rehab. More importantly, Lenin's cirrhosis was found to be treatable, and he's expected to make a full recovery. That night, Maura forces an unwilling Ramsay to engage in an Irish folk dance with her.\n |LineColor       = e3cd81\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 10\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 6\n |Title           = The Sandgate Hotel\n |Aux1            = [[Sandgate, Kent|Sandgate]], England\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2006|2|28|df=y}}\n |ShortSummary    = Upon visiting the Sandgate Hotel, Ramsay is immediately confused with the hotel's layout. There is a bar, a restaurant, and even a Japanese restaurant downstairs, all run from the same kitchen. To further complicate the experience, each has their own menu and diners cannot order from one menu without going to the other restaurant. Ramsay finds Stuart White, a gentle Geordie, in charge of the kitchen alongside his young inexperienced assistants. Ramsay identifies numerous issues: Stuart is clearly not comfortable cooking the bizarre range of food and has no experience in cooking Japanese food; he must leave the kitchen to his junior chefs while he runs the balcony grill; the orders are sent through an intercom system that disrupts the kitchen; the hotel staff spend too much time and money at their own bar (and in fact are inadvertently keeping the hotel afloat); and the number of managers causes confusion over who is in charge. Furthermore, during the week Stuart loses his [[The Automobile Association|AA rosette]], severely demoralising him. Despite these problems, Ramsay manages to set the restaurant on the right path by turning the Japanese restaurant into an exclusive dining area, focusing the menu on fresh seafood, and establishing more control over the front of house with owner Lois as the host.\n\nRamsay returns to find that turnover has doubled and while Stuart had not yet regained his AA rosette, he was relieved to find his morale and passion had improved.\n |LineColor       = e3cd81\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 11\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 7\n |Title           = Clubway 41\n |Aux1            = [[Blackpool]], England\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2006|3|7|df=y}}\n |ShortSummary    = Clubway 41 is run by Dave Jackson and his girlfriend Dawn Brindley, and is heavily promoted on the back of being named Blackpool Restaurant of the Year, but is struggling to attract customers. Ramsay finds that the upstairs restaurant is being kept afloat by the downstairs [[greasy spoon]] caf\u00e9. Dave's [[salmon]] with strawberry and mash with [[nectarine]]s are appalling to Ramsay. Dave has difficulty taking criticism from Ramsay and shows little proficiency for cooking, and even less familiarity with managing a kitchen, even with the downstairs cook Nigel Lloyd, who was more capable in handling the rush. Digging deeper, Ramsay discovers that no locals have heard of the award-winning Clubway 41 and obtains copies of the nomination forms, finding the reviews to be almost farcical. Identifying the difficulty with attracting customers to an upstairs restaurant, he takes a risk and turns the downstairs caf\u00e9 into the main attraction, focusing on simple English food. In the reopening, the restaurant is renamed ''Jacksons''. With Dave and Nigel in the kitchen, the service begins well, and while Nigel is a capable assistant, Dave continues to struggle with handling the workload.\n\nWhen Ramsay revisits, he finds a significant turn of events. A new bus stop was built in front of the restaurant, deterring customers from coming in. Nigel has left, leaving Dave in the kitchen, and the restaurant has reverted to its previous greasy spoon fare. Ramsay brings the owners out to Blackpool to do heavy promoting and places ads on the buses to help bring customers back.\n |LineColor       = e3cd81\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 12\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 8\n |Title           = La Gondola\n |Aux1            = [[Derby]], England\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2006|3|14|df=y}}\n |ShortSummary    = Daniela Bayfield has invested in a 40-year-old establishment and is hesitant to modernise, and relies on functions to sustain the restaurant rather than a steady customer base. Ramsay states that the restaurant is stuck in a time warp, with dishes and service reminiscent of the 70s and the dishes are severely underpriced, making a loss per sale. Head chef Steve Straughan lacks passion and is unused to busy sessions. During a birthday function, the kitchen uses canned tuna to substitute for tuna steaks, uses bought-in [[apple pie]] instead of making it, and mixes freshly made [[minestrone soup]] with packet soup to save costs. Steve struggles to maintain order in the kitchen during service without a clear system. Ramsay discards the complicated menu and devises a new, simpler menu and changes the decor in the dining room. He also brings back the [[flamb\u00e9]] table service as a hallmark of the restaurant. The dinner service proceeds well, though Steve still has difficulty communicating with the team.\n\nWhen Ramsay revisits, he discovers that Steve has moved on and Daniela has gone through several chefs before hiring a new one.\n |LineColor       = e3cd81\n}}\n|}\n\n===Series 3: 2006===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width:98%; margin:auto; background:#fff;\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#b4e381; color:#000;\" width=7% | No.<br />overall\n! style=\"background:#b4e381; color:#000;\" width=7% | No. in<br />series\n! style=\"background:#b4e381; color:#000;\" width=40% | Restaurant\n! style=\"background:#b4e381; color:#000;\" width=20% | Location\n! style=\"background:#b4e381; color:#000;\" width=15% | Original air date\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 13\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 1\n |Title           = La Parra de Burriana\n |Aux1            = [[Nerja]], [[Spain]]\n |OriginalAirDate = \n |ShortSummary    = Laurence Davy runs a restaurant in an ideal Spanish holiday location, but has difficulty attracting locals. Ramsay discovers a menu that encompasses numerous cuisines and appalling recipes, such as [[prawn]]s with chocolate sauce and chicken with banana. Poor service and improperly cooked food have given the restaurant a negative reputation. To show the staff the importance of letting ingredients speak for themselves, he creates smoothies from the menu items, including the prawns with chocolate, with Lawrence being unable to identify the prawns. Ramsay creates a simple menu for the night's service, but Lawrence insists that he is in control of his large, unpopular menu and only switches to Ramsay's backup menu after it is too late. To make things worse, the restaurant is robbed during the night, with the thieves taking money from the takings stored in a filing cabinets. Ramsay takes Laurence to a [[bullfighting]] school to demonstrate the importance of listening to expert advice. He also berates Laurence over his excessive use of his [[flattop grill|plancha grill]], causing food to be overcooked and taste monotonous, and teaches him to cook fresh food in pans. The final service begins well, but the staff have double-booked tables, causing confusion in the kitchen and ruining a nearly flawless reopening. Ramsay leaves, concerned that the restaurant would not make it through the slower winter season.\n\nWhen Ramsay revisits, he finds that the restaurant is doing well, and Laurence has ceased using the grill.

At 62 years of age, Brian (and his wife, Elaine Howden) are working between 100 and 120 hours a week and his age and health create disorder in kitchen as he is unable to keep track of orders. Ramsay also finds that Brian is a [[compulsive hoarding|compulsive hoarder]], collecting a bizarre collection of [[crockery]] from [[eBay]]. To address the problems, Ramsay removes Brian from the kitchen and moves him to the front of house. However, Brian is unable to fully remove himself from his duties and creates another batch of terrible sauce. Ramsay throws the sauce out and gets Brian to begin selling his excessive plate collection. He turns Brian over to a simpler menu, focusing on classic pub dishes instead of pretending to be a restaurant, and to complement the excellent [[Yorkshire pudding]], Ramsay creates a new focus and campaign for the pub to bring back real [[gravy]]. Brian is enthusiastic about the idea and the staff market their new gravy in town. Despite some confusion in the service, the kitchen staff hold up under pressure and the customers are pleased with the new food. Ramsay leaves after making Brian promise not to step back into the kitchen.\n\nDuring his revisit, Ramsay is shocked to learn that Brian has returned to the kitchen. The kitchen staff have been left shorthanded and he is filling in until they can employ a new chef, and subsequently he has begun reverting to some of his old habits.

After speaking to the locals and finding out about the Rococo's abysmal reputation, Ramsay tells Nick that there's no way he can salvage things as they are, and that the only way to recover is to effectively start over with a new restaurant in the same building. Nick agrees, and Rococo is renamed '''Maggie's''', given a complete makeover and refit, and a new menu focused around local seafood.\n\nWhen he revisits, Ramsay is happy to find that Nick has embraced the restaurant's new identity, and has finally shaken off his ghosts of the past.\n |LineColor       = b4e381\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 16\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 4\n |Title           = Morgans\n |Aux1            = [[Liverpool]], England\n |OriginalAirDate = \n |ShortSummary    = Ramsay has major issues with the food, but finds the biggest problem to be the feuds among the owners and staff; owner Sandy Morgan has little knowledge of restaurants and insists on personally buying all the ingredients from a nearby supermarket, younger daughter Laura Kelly has even less, elder daughter Helen Kelly has the most business knowledge but only works at the restaurant part-time, head chef Philip Lee has a confrontational attitude, uses bizarre combinations (such as mashed potatoes and apricot) in the menu and doesn't get on with sous chef Emma, who nonetheless serves Ramsay the only thing he likes, a [[sticky toffee pudding]]. Ramsay finds it hard going, and the continued feuds cause Laura to temporarily walk away from the restaurant, but with Helen committing to the restaurant full-time and Phil agreeing to work more with Emma and simplifying the menu, things begin to look up.\n\nWhen he revisits, Ramsay finds the restaurant running much better, thanks to Helen handling the business aspects and Sandy focusing on hospitality. Most significantly however, it's revealed that just a week after Ramsay left, Sandy decided to promote Emma to head chef and gave Phil an ultimatum to accept demotion to sous chef or be fired, which resulted in him quitting.

On sampling the food, Ramsay realises that the restaurant's fish is too expensive and sub-standard, and on taking Alex and Jamie to a local fish market finds that [[pollock]] is in plentiful local supply. A revamped menu with a pollock fish and chips meal proves a hit, but things nearly stall when Ramsay clashes with Allan over the restaurant's gaudy decor, which Allan is proud of and threatens to stop filming if Ramsay attempts to change it. Despite this, Allan eventually agrees to allow a makeover, and Ramsay also has the restaurant renamed '''Love's Fish Restaurant''' so as to take advantage of its biggest asset, Allan himself.

Ramsay also strongly criticizes the work ethic and competence of head chef Toby, and is infuriated to discover the kitchen is full of old food and filthy, rusting equipment, which he orders to be replaced. However, Ramsay suspects that the kitchen staff are merely demotivated due to the unchanging menu, and sets up a new grill menu, only for Toby to turn out to be even worse at cooking that than he was the carvery. Ramsay's patience with Toby runs out, and he orders the restaurant's general manager Matt, himself an experienced chef, to take over from Toby, who is demoted to sous chef. This change in roles finally gets things moving, and under Matt's leadership the kitchen finally gets through a service.\n\nIn the revisit, Ramsay is happy to see that Matt is still heading up the kitchen and that Toby has been fired for serving expired chicken, but alarmed to find that Scott has refused to fully commit to the new menu, and is only running it on weekdays, with the carvery still running at weekends.

At Ramsay's urging, head chef Khan puts a lamb [[korma]] made from a family recipe on the menu for the second night's service, which proves a big hit and wins Raz over.

While Laurence eventually agrees to remove the pasta dishes from his menu, Ramsay admits as he leaves that he's no longer as optimistic about the restaurant's future as he was during his initial revisit, and is worried that Laurence will soon lose focus again.\n |LineColor       = 81e393\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 28\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 6\n |Title           = The Fenwick Arms\n |Aux1            = Claughton, England\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2007|11|13|df=y}}\n |ShortSummary    = \"Revisited\" episode\n |LineColor       = 81e393\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 29\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 7\n |Title           = The Granary\n |Aux1            = [[Titchfield]], England\n |OriginalAirDate = \n |ShortSummary    = The Granary is run by ambitious entrepreneur Nigel Nieddu. Originally intended as an exclusive club for the rich and famous, Nigel has had to rebrand the restaurant, which now struggles to pull customers and has a poor reputation with the locals for its exclusive impression. Ramsay and Nigel eat lunch together, where it becomes clear that the restaurant does not live up to its focus of modern British food, with too many exotic dishes on the menu, such as shark with mozzarella, that the kitchen staff struggle to cook. The kitchen is run by Martin, who has taken on board two delinquent boys to help them back on track with cooking. Ramsay books the restaurant to half capacity for lunch to test the kitchen, but unused to even these numbers, the staff struggle to keep up. Ramsay identifies the main weakness to be Nigel, who has no experience as a restaurant manager, lacks control over the dining room and has difficulty accepting criticism. This is demonstrated when Nigel struggles to delegate tasks to his staff when challenged to put together a prefabricated chicken coop. After convincing Nigel to turn to a simpler British menu and allowing Martin to have more control, the staff host a food fair to bring the community back. The reopening begins well, but Martin struggles with the numbers and fails to show strong leadership under pressure. The kitchen staff lose discipline, although young cook Pete is able to hold himself together. The service is disappointing, with Martin disappointed with himself and Nigel determined to get it right.\n\nRevisiting the restaurant, Ramsay is pleased to find the restaurant is maintaining a steady flow of customers. Martin reveals that he is leaving after applying for a government-funded workshop to help troubled kids through cooking.\n |LineColor       = 81e393\n}}\n\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 30\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 8\n |Title           = The Fish and Anchor\n |Aux1            = [[Lampeter]], Wales\n |OriginalAirDate = \n |ShortSummary    = Run by former Italian boxer Mike Ciminera, The Fish and Anchor is a local eatery filled with sports memorabilia and with a tarnished reputation, with Mike and wife Caron notorious for their feuding, which has scared customers away. Ramsay learns that Mike, while passionate and ambitious, is not a trained chef and has based his menu on cookbooks written by celebrity chefs such as [[Jamie Oliver]], [[Rick Stein]] and Gordon Ramsay himself. Ramsay is critical of the menu's complexity and lack of focus, and his concerns are proven in the evening service. As the cookbooks are written for home cooking, the dishes are too complex to manage in a busy restaurant environment and Mike does not know how to handle multiple orders. Half the customers are not served food, and Caron verbally confronts and kicks out several customers. The next day, Ramsay gets rid of Mike's cookbooks and removes the exotic dishes from the menu. He appeals to Mike's proud Italian heritage and creates an authentic [[meatball]] item. Mike is capable of handling the orders in the following service with praise for the food, but the night is ruined when Caron forgets an order and throws a tantrum. Ramsay manages to help the couple ease the tension and work together. They go into town to promote their new menu and service. Before the service, Ramsay sets up a punching bag outside to get the couple to vent their anger. The restaurant is packed, and Caron proves to have overcome her temper issues. However, Mike's inexperience in managing a full dining room causes him to fall behind. The service is stopped when one of the waitresses slips and falls, being knocked unconscious and taken to hospital.\n\nWhen Ramsay revisits, he finds that Mike has changed the ugly blue paint to a pleasing white. Business has doubled and Caron and Mike no longer argue. To verify this, Ramsay calls up recent customers, who confirm their positive experience. He parts ways with the couple and gifts them with their own empty cookbook, and tells Mike to fill it with his own recipes.\n |LineColor       = 81e393\n}}\n\n|}\n\n===Series 5: 2007===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width:98%; margin:auto; background:#fff;\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#81e393; color:#000;\" width=7% | No.<br />overall\n! style=\"background:#81e393; color:#000;\" width=7% | No. in<br />series\n! style=\"background:#81e393; color:#000;\" width=40% | Restaurant\n! style=\"background:#81e393; color:#000;\" width=20% | Location\n! style=\"background:#81e393; color:#000;\" width=15% | Original air date\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = \n |EpisodeNumber2  = 1\n |Title           = The Glass House\n |Aux1            = [[Ambleside]], England\n |OriginalAirDate = \n |ShortSummary    = \"Revisited\" episode\n\nAfter recapping the original episode, Ramsay returns to the Glass House for a second time, and is happy to see standards mostly being maintained, though he takes the time to criticize Richard for allowing standards to slip a little in certain areas. Fortunately, Richard quickly corrects this. It's noted that a few members in the kitchen team have changed; in particular, two of them have been hired by Ramsay himself to work at his restaurants.\n |LineColor       = e2a482\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = \n |EpisodeNumber2  = 2\n |Title           = The Walnut Tree Inn\n |Aux1            = Llandewi Skirrid, Wales\n |OriginalAirDate = \n |ShortSummary    = \"Revisited\" episode\n\nWhile the overall standard of food has been broadly maintained as of his second revisit, Ramsay is dismayed to find that the number of customers has dropped to its lowest-ever number, and that Francesco is still charging extremely high prices that, on average, are in excess of \u00a360 for an entr\u00e9e alone. After speaking to the locals and finding out that those who've visited the inn have enjoyed the food but not felt it to be worth the price, Ramsay creates a new dish that can be sold for half the price of the existing items and still be very profitable. However, Francesco is adamant that his approach is correct, and openly says that he would rather see the inn go out of business than make prices as cheap as Ramsay is suggesting. Ramsay gives up, tells Francesco that the inn ''will'' close if he maintains his current approach, and leaves.\n |LineColor       = e2a482\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = \n |EpisodeNumber2  = 3\n |Title           = Moore Place\n |Aux1            = Esher, England\n |OriginalAirDate = \n |ShortSummary    = \"Revisited\" episode\nRamsey revisits the establishment and is shocked to see that the building has still not be repainted, despite this being one of the primary complaints from the locals.

Ramsay also catches up with Tim, who has decided to change careers completely and happily pursuing work in television as a runner, though is dismayed to find that, like in the original episode, Tim still can't successfully cook an [[omelette]].\n |LineColor       = e2a482\n}}\n|}\n\n===Great British Nightmare===\nA one-off special entitled ''Ramsay's Great British Nightmare'' aired on Channel 4 on 30 January 2009 as part of 'The Great British Food Fight', a two-week series of food-related programming.

Ramsay is firstly appalled by the psychedelic wallpaper. While Ramsay is impressed with the simple menu, he is furious to find that Mick has very little cooking ability, using [[Squash (drink)|orange squash]] to make a sauce and using vacuum-sealed pre-cooked [[lamb shank]]s in a microwave bag. Not only does he show little responsibility in the kitchen, he is also secretive with his spending and is hugely in debt. Mick is adamant that the problems in the kitchen are not his fault, and his stubbornness causes a rift with his wife and daughter. Ramsay solves the crisis by taking the business matters out of Mick's hands and kicks him out of the kitchen. His daughter, Michelle, is placed in charge of the kitchen despite having no cooking experience. She rises to the challenge, and while Mick is not convinced over replacing his microwave food, the reopening is a success.\n\nMonths later, Ramsay returns to find that the restaurant is making profit. He sent Michelle for further culinary training, and she impresses Ramsay with freshly cooked food.\n\nThe restaurant was renamed ''Martins' Bistro'' during production.\n |LineColor       = 81e3d4\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 32\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 2\n |Title           = The Runaway Girl\n |Aux1            = [[Sheffield]], England\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2009|1|30|df=y}}\n |ShortSummary    = Justin runs The Runaway Girl, specialising in Spanish [[tapas]], with best friend and head chef, Richie. Ramsay is not impressed with the decor, finding the name and appearance to be similar to a [[strip club]]. He discovers that the kitchen does no preparation work before service, as Richie has pre-cooked and stored all the meals in advance to prevent wastage. He discovers that Justin invests very little in the kitchen and focuses on organising live music events, which customers find loud and obnoxious. Richie and Justin fall out, with Richie launching a heated tirade about Justin's inability to listen to criticism. Ramsay employs a [[mystery shopping|mystery diner]] to assess the service, and despite Justin claiming to recognise their purpose, botches the service and forgets to even provide cutlery, resulting in a scathing review. After helping Justin and Richie make amends, he refurbishes the restaurant and renames it ''Silversmiths'', bans live music and, realising that they have no chance of competing against local Spanish restaurants, changes the focus to modern British cuisine.\n\nBefore Ramsay's revisit, he sends another mystery diner to the restaurant, who gives a positive assessment of the service.

Ramsay initially sees Jack's son John as the right man to take over, but quickly loses faith on finding out that not only has the car hire business that John runs separately been a huge failure, he's invested \u20ac40,000 of his parents' money into it too. After forcing John to promise to shut down his hire business and eventually repay his parents, and getting Jack to get rid of his hoard, Ramsay renames the restaurant '''Jack's Chicken Shack''' and creates a new menu focused around fried chicken. The service that follows initially goes poorly thanks to John's poor handling of the order system, but he eventually gets the hang of it, and service is successfully completed.\n\nIn his revisit, Ramsay is encouraged to find that the restaurant is still busy, Juan has been moved to barkeeping duties and replaced by a younger chef (also called Juan), and cleanliness standards have been maintained.

However, Tim is discovered to be a big part of the problem due to his interference in service, refusal to allow Steve to set his own menu, and careless handling of the business side of the restaurant. While Ramsay has further criticism for Steve's lack of local product knowledge and not even being able to speak French, he and the kitchen staff prove their skill by cooking good dishes after Ramsay takes them to a local seafood market, only for Tim to berate the staff when he sees the results, accusing them of holding back and even threatening to fire them. Despite this, the reopening night goes well, and Ramsay tells Tim that so long as he doesn't interfere with the running of the kitchen, he can make Le Deck a success.\n\nNo revisit is shown in the episode, though an epilogue caption reveals that the restaurant is still doing well, while Steve has left and returned to the mountain resort where he previously worked, leaving sous chef Stuey to take over as head chef.\n |LineColor       = ffd3d4\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 35\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 3\n |Title           = La Granada Divino\n |Aux1            = [[Gauc\u00edn]], Spain\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2014|10|7|df=y}}\n |ShortSummary    = In a Kitchen Nightmares first, Ramsay works with a restaurant that has opened only 8 weeks prior to his arrival. Owners Milan and Gina are new to the restaurant industry and their inexperience leads them to lean on head chef Neal to manage the restaurant as well as run the kitchen, putting heavy pressure on Neal. Ramsay notes that the restaurant\u2019s menu is too complicated for a small brigade and discovers Neal fails to delegate to his assistant chefs, which heavily slows down service and causes Neal to be extremely stressed while cooking.\n\nIn order to demonstrate the difficulty that Neal and the servers are under, Ramsay has Milan and Gina work a service with only six guests, which forces them to see the negative impact of decisions they had made, like the broken dumbwaiter and the complicated menu. He also implements a new menu around sharing plates, which takes pressure off the kitchen. During the relaunch, the service initially starts off very strong. However, when the sharing plates run out, Neal buckles under pressure and reverts to his bad habits. Fortunately, Ramsay is able to get Neal back on track, saving the service and impressing a local food critic.\n\nNo revisit is shown in the episode, but it is said that the restaurant is taking in 5,000 pounds a week, Neal and Emily are managing the restaurant, and the owners have taken a step back.\n\n |LineColor       = ffd3d4\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 36\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 4\n |Title           = Quelcuttis\n |Aux1            = [[Els Poblets]], Spain\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2014|10|14|df=y}}\n |ShortSummary    = Initially, Ramsay is put off by the fact that siblings Joe and Terry Quelcutti seem more interested in running the establishment as a bar rather than a restaurant, which has caused chef Terry\u2019s food to be abysmal. However, he identifies a bigger problem: server Joe\u2019s inability to keep cool during service leads him to regularly confront guests he\u2019s meant to be serving. In order to improve the siblings\u2019 abilities in the front and back of house, Ramsay has them work a lunch service at Quique De Costa, a Michelin-starred restaurant in the area.\n\nRamsay relaunches the restaurant as '''Quelcutti\u2019s Tapas''' with a menu focused on Spanish tapas and quality wine. During service, Joe\u2019s panicky nature initially causes him to take too many food orders and get short with Ramsay; fortunately, Joe is able to regain his rhythm and the service ends well.

But the organization traces its roots to a movement of British university students, starting at [[Cambridge University]] in 1877. The movement spread to Canada before reaching the U.S. In 1938 Stacey Woods, the Canadian Inter-Varsity director, met with students on the University of Michigan campus. As an immediate result of that visit, students formed the first InterVarsity chapter in the United States. InterVarsity's first three staff members came on loan from Canada, and Stacey Woods served as the organization's General Secretary (CEO). In 1947 InterVarsity USA became one of ten founding members of the International Fellowship of Evangelical Students, a federation of national Christian student movements. By 1950 there were 35 staff workers serving students in 499 InterVarsity chapters and by the early seventies, the on-campus staff had grown to more than 200.\n\n==Statement of Faith==\nAccording to InterVarsity's official [https://intervarsity.org/about-us/our-purpose website], their purpose statement is the following:\n{{cquote|\nIn response to God's love, grace and truth: The Purpose of InterVarsity Christian Fellowship/USA is to establish and advance at colleges and universities witnessing communities of students and faculty who follow Jesus as Savior and Lord: growing in love for God, God's Word, God's people of every ethnicity and culture and God's purposes in the world.}}\n\nThrough the 20th century, InterVarsity used a brief statement of faith, called the Basis of Faith, which in January 1960 was supplemented by a unanimous National Staff Conference with what was called the Bear Trap statement, which defined the faith in terms of general Evangelical convictions.<ref>The statements of faith are reprinted in Keith Hunt and Gladys Hunt: [https://books.google.com/books?id=aQffPN49ajEC&pg=PA382 For Christ and the University: The Story of InterVarsity Christian Fellowship of the USA - 1940-1990] InterVarsity Press, 1991.</ref> On October 20, 2000, the board of Trustees adopted [https://intervarsity.org/about-us/what-we-believe a modified version of their previous statement of faith]:\n\n{{cquote|\n* The only true God, the almighty Creator of all things, existing eternally in three persons Father, Son, and Holy Spirit full of love and glory.\n* The unique divine inspiration, entire trustworthiness and authority of the Bible.\n* The value and dignity of all people: created in God's image to live in love and holiness, but alienated from God and each other because of our sin and guilt, and justly subject to God's wrath.\n* Jesus Christ, fully human and fully divine, who lived as a perfect example, who assumed the judgment due sinners by dying in our place, and who was bodily raised from the dead and ascended as Savior and Lord.\n* Justification by God's grace to all who repent and put their faith in Jesus Christ alone for salvation.\n* The indwelling presence and transforming power of the Holy Spirit, who gives to all believers a new life and a new calling to obedient service.\n* The unity of all believers in Jesus Christ, manifest in worshiping and witnessing churches making disciples throughout the world.\n* The victorious reign and future personal return of Jesus Christ, who will judge all people with justice and mercy, giving over the unrepentant to eternal condemnation but receiving the redeemed into eternal life.\n*To God be glory forever.}}\n\nIn 2016, InterVarsity clarified its requirements for staff, asking that they affirm traditional, orthodox views of sexuality that are shared by most evangelical denominations.<ref>http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2016/october-web-only/intervarsity-asks-staff-to-choose-stance-on-sexuality.html</ref> Staff are asked to affirm a twenty-page document which affirms the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament sexual ethic that limits sexual expression to marriage between a man and a woman.<ref>https://www.scribd.com/document/326684433/InterVarsity-Christian-Fellowship-Theology-of-Human-Sexuality-Paper#from_embed</ref> However, this change in policy has prompted controversy, especially from [[LGBTQ]] Christians and their supporters.<ref>{{cite news |title=Top Evangelical College Group to Dismiss Employees Who Support Gay Marriage |author=Dias, Elizabeth |url=http://time.com/4521944/intervarsity-fellowship-gay-marriage/|newspaper=Time Magazine |date=6 October 2016|accessdate=10 October 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=InterVarsity's Move on Gay Marriage|author=Merrit, Jonathan|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/10/campus-ministry-a-culture-war-outpost/503426/|newspaper=The Atlantic|date=7 October 2016|accessdate=10 October 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Ministries==\n===College ministry===\n[[File:Urbana 2012.jpg|thumb|250px|The opening plenary session at Urbana 12, InterVarsity's 2012 Student Missions Conference, in the Edward Jones Dome in St. Louis]]\nOf the 772 campuses where InterVarsity is present, many have multiple chapters which might focus individually on Greek life students, international students, nursing students, graduate students, athletes, artists, and members of ethnic minorities, or be more generalized depending on the campus.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://intervarsity.org/our-ministry|title=Our Ministry|date=2016-03-10|work=InterVarsity|access-date=2017-12-20|language=en}}</ref> These include 71 ethnic-specific chapters ministering to Blacks, Asians, Native Americans, Filipinos, and Latinos.

Graduate & Faculty Ministry staff work with 192 chapters dedicated to graduate students, professional students, and faculty.\n\nNurses Christian Fellowship (NCF) is unique among the ministries of InterVarsity; it is a professional organization as well as a student ministry.  In addition to campus ministry, NCF offers continuing education courses and the professional publication, ''[http://journals.lww.com/journalofchristiannursing/pages/default.aspx Journal of Christian Nursing]'', to practicing nurses.\n\nInterVarsity activities on campus are varied.\nWeekly large group meetings include student-led worship, a presentation on a topic of spiritual interest, and a social time.  Small group Bible studies are organized around a dorm setting, or like-minded people such as members of a sports team or those interested in a particular topic of study.  These are student-led and foster a sense of belonging that today's students desire.  Some of the Bible studies are specifically designed for people interested in spirituality but who may not call themselves Christians. Known as GIGs, Groups Investigating God, these studies allow interested students to explore the claims of the Bible in an open, accepting atmosphere where their questions are taken seriously. In the 2017-2018 school year through its various outreach activities, large group meetings, and Bible studies, chapter leaders reported 4,199 first-time professions of faith in Jesus as Savior and Lord, a 93 percent increase over ten years before.\n\n===Bible Study===\nBible study has always been an important part of InterVarsity's campus ministry. InterVarsity staff worker Paul Byer is credited with developing the Manuscript Study method of inductive Bible study,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://madden.customer.netspace.net.au/history.html |title=History |publisher=Madden.customer.netspace.net.au |date=1986-10-27 |accessdate=February 24, 2012}}</ref> a useful tool for inductive Bible studies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.intervarsity.org/bible-studies/inductive-bible-study-hints |title=Inductive Bible Study Hints - Bible Studies |publisher=InterVarsity.org |date= |accessdate=February 24, 2012}}</ref> After graduating from the University of Southern California with a degree in architecture, Byer became one of the leading forces in InterVarsity, as both a campus staff worker and as the West Coast Regional Director, and was the developer of the Manuscript Study method.<ref>[http://regions.ivcf.org/training/318 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050305201813/http://regions.ivcf.org/training/318 |date=March 5, 2005 }}</ref> Through his innovative approach to Bible Study, extensive mentoring, and long tenure he helped shape the theology and culture of the entire movement.  The Manuscript Study method continues to be used heavily by InterVarsity as one of many tools to help students investigate and learn from the teachings of the Bible.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bibleseo.com/bible-study-methods/manuscript-bible-study-method/ |title=Manuscript Bible Study Method &#124; Bible Study Lessons &#124; Free Inductive Study Guide, Topics & Tools |publisher=Bibleseo.com |date= |accessdate=February 24, 2012}}</ref>\n\nOther early staff members laid more of the foundation for InterVarsity's commitment to Bible study. Jane Hollingsworth learned inductive Bible study in seminary and in turn trained staff members in the 1940s. She wrote the first Bible study guide published by InterVarsity, ''Discovering the Gospel of Mark''. In the 1960s, veteran staff member Barbara Boyd developed what became the Bible and Life Training Courses, experienced by decades of students.<ref>For Christ and the University by Keith and Gladys Hunt, InterVarsity Press, 1991</ref>\n\n===Missions===\nInterVarsity students regularly participate in both long- and short-term missions projects. During each summer several hundred students participate in a \"Global Urban Trek,\" working in some of the poorest cities of the world, or \"Global Programs,\" lingua-cultural or service ministries overseas. InterVarsity also sponsors \"Urban Programs\" in more than two dozen cities in the United States, helping students understand God's love for all people by working alongside existing ministries in the inner city.\n\nInterVarsity, as a member movement, participates in the global student ministry network, the [[International Fellowship of Evangelical Students]] (IFES), by sending staff and recent graduates to work under the authority of local IFES staff in countries around the world.\n\nInterVarsity, Inter-Varsity Canada, and Groupes Bibliques Universitaires et Collegiaux of French-speaking Canada co-host [[Urbana (convention)|Urbana Missions Conference]], a triennial student missions convention, named for the campus town where it was held for many years. Since the first Convention in 1946, nearly 269,000 attendees have heard the challenge to participate in God's global mission. In December 2006, approximately 16,000 attendees participated in the convention as it was held for the first time in St. Louis, Missouri. Of the approximately [http://intervarsity.org/news/new-generation-stories 16,000 attendees] at Urbana 15, 9,416 said yes to serving in a global or cross-cultural setting\u2014short-term, mid-term, and long-term combined, 9,254 said yes to regularly praying and interceding for the global church, and 5,418 said yes to continuing with others their Bible study of Matthew's Gospel that began at Urbana.\n\n===Training===\nInterVarsity operates several training centers, [[Campus by the Sea]] Catalina Island, CA; Toah Nipi, Rindge, NH; [[Cedar Campus]], Cedarville, MI; Bear Trap Ranch, Colorado Springs, CO; and, until recently, Forest Springs, WI <https://chapterfocusweek.com/register/>. These camps are used for weekend conferences during the school year, week-long training sessions at the beginning and end of summer break, and faculty and alumni retreats.  Cedar Campus is the site of the InterVarsity Leadership Institute, a month-long summer program of Bible study, prayer and evangelism training.  In 2015, a total of 20,800 people attended events at InterVarsity's training centers.\n\nIn conjunction with InterVarsity's missions program, the training centers offer Student Training in Missions, STIM. This program seeks to prepare students for cross-cultural missions through a series of weekend programs that offer lecture, discussion and cross-cultural simulations.\n\n==InterVarsity Press==\n[[File:InterVarsity_Press_logo_New_2019.jpg|thumb|right|logo of InterVarsity Press]]\nIn 1947 the InterVarsity/USA Board of Trustees determined that the Fellowship should develop its own publishing arm.

But the organization traces its roots to a movement of British university students, starting at [[Cambridge University]] in 1877. The movement spread to Canada before reaching the U.S. In 1938 Stacey Woods, the Canadian Inter-Varsity director, met with students on the University of Michigan campus. As an immediate result of that visit, students formed the first InterVarsity chapter in the United States. InterVarsity's first three staff members came on loan from Canada, and Stacey Woods served as the organization's General Secretary (CEO). In 1947 InterVarsity USA became one of ten founding members of the International Fellowship of Evangelical Students, a federation of national Christian student movements. By 1950 there were 35 staff workers serving students in 499 InterVarsity chapters and by the early seventies, the on-campus staff had grown to more than 200.\n\n==Statement of Faith==\nAccording to InterVarsity's official [https://intervarsity.org/about-us/our-purpose website], their purpose statement is the following:\n{{cquote|\nIn response to God's love, grace and truth: The Purpose of InterVarsity Christian Fellowship/USA is to establish and advance at colleges and universities witnessing communities of students and faculty who follow Jesus as Savior and Lord: growing in love for God, God's Word, God's people of every ethnicity and culture and God's purposes in the world.}}\n\nThrough the 20th century, InterVarsity used a brief statement of faith, called the Basis of Faith, which in January 1960 was supplemented by a unanimous National Staff Conference with what was called the Bear Trap statement, which defined the faith in terms of general Evangelical convictions.<ref>The statements of faith are reprinted in Keith Hunt and Gladys Hunt: [https://books.google.com/books?id=aQffPN49ajEC&pg=PA382 For Christ and the University: The Story of InterVarsity Christian Fellowship of the USA - 1940-1990] InterVarsity Press, 1991.</ref> On October 20, 2000, the board of Trustees adopted [https://intervarsity.org/about-us/what-we-believe a modified version of their previous statement of faith]:\n\n{{cquote|\n* The only true God, the almighty Creator of all things, existing eternally in three persons Father, Son, and Holy Spirit full of love and glory.\n* The unique divine inspiration, entire trustworthiness and authority of the Bible.\n* The value and dignity of all people: created in God's image to live in love and holiness, but alienated from God and each other because of our sin and guilt, and justly subject to God's wrath.\n* Jesus Christ, fully human and fully divine, who lived as a perfect example, who assumed the judgment due sinners by dying in our place, and who was bodily raised from the dead and ascended as Savior and Lord.\n* Justification by God's grace to all who repent and put their faith in Jesus Christ alone for salvation.\n* The indwelling presence and transforming power of the Holy Spirit, who gives to all believers a new life and a new calling to obedient service.\n* The unity of all believers in Jesus Christ, manifest in worshiping and witnessing churches making disciples throughout the world.\n* The victorious reign and future personal return of Jesus Christ, who will judge all people with justice and mercy, giving over the unrepentant to eternal condemnation but receiving the redeemed into eternal life.\n*To God be glory forever.}}\n\nIn 2016, InterVarsity clarified its requirements for staff, asking that they affirm traditional, orthodox views of sexuality that are shared by most evangelical denominations.<ref>http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2016/october-web-only/intervarsity-asks-staff-to-choose-stance-on-sexuality.html</ref> Staff are asked to affirm a twenty-page document which affirms the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament sexual ethic that limits sexual expression to marriage between a man and a woman.<ref>https://www.scribd.com/document/326684433/InterVarsity-Christian-Fellowship-Theology-of-Human-Sexuality-Paper#from_embed</ref> However, this change in policy has prompted controversy, especially from [[LGBTQ]] Christians and their supporters.<ref>{{cite news |title=Top Evangelical College Group to Dismiss Employees Who Support Gay Marriage |author=Dias, Elizabeth |url=http://time.com/4521944/intervarsity-fellowship-gay-marriage/|newspaper=Time Magazine |date=6 October 2016|accessdate=10 October 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=InterVarsity's Move on Gay Marriage|author=Merrit, Jonathan|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/10/campus-ministry-a-culture-war-outpost/503426/|newspaper=The Atlantic|date=7 October 2016|accessdate=10 October 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Ministries==\n===College ministry===\n[[File:Urbana 2012.jpg|thumb|250px|The opening plenary session at Urbana 12, InterVarsity's 2012 Student Missions Conference, in the Edward Jones Dome in St. Louis]]\nOf the 772 campuses where InterVarsity is present, many have multiple chapters which might focus individually on Greek life students, international students, nursing students, graduate students, athletes, artists, and members of ethnic minorities, or be more generalized depending on the campus.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://intervarsity.org/our-ministry|title=Our Ministry|date=2016-03-10|work=InterVarsity|access-date=2017-12-20|language=en}}</ref> These include 71 ethnic-specific chapters ministering to Blacks, Asians, Native Americans, Filipinos, and Latinos.  Of the 34,750 active InterVarsity students, 15,198, or 44%, identify themselves as ethnic minority or multiracial students.\n\nInterVarsity also [[International_student_ministry|ministers to international students]] on many campuses, including 68 campuses with specific international student fellowships.  Graduate & Faculty Ministry staff work with 192 chapters dedicated to graduate students, professional students, and faculty.\n\nNurses Christian Fellowship (NCF) is unique among the ministries of InterVarsity; it is a professional organization as well as a student ministry.  In addition to campus ministry, NCF offers continuing education courses and the professional publication, ''[http://journals.lww.com/journalofchristiannursing/pages/default.aspx Journal of Christian Nursing]'', to practicing nurses.\n\nInterVarsity activities on campus are varied.\nWeekly large group meetings include student-led worship, a presentation on a topic of spiritual interest, and a social time.  Small group Bible studies are organized around a dorm setting, or like-minded people such as members of a sports team or those interested in a particular topic of study.  These are student-led and foster a sense of belonging that today's students desire.  Some of the Bible studies are specifically designed for people interested in spirituality but who may not call themselves Christians. Known as GIGs, Groups Investigating God, these studies allow interested students to explore the claims of the Bible in an open, accepting atmosphere where their questions are taken seriously. In the 2017-2018 school year through its various outreach activities, large group meetings, and Bible studies, chapter leaders reported 4,199 first-time professions of faith in Jesus as Savior and Lord, a 93 percent increase over ten years before.\n\n===Bible Study===\nBible study has always been an important part of InterVarsity's campus ministry. InterVarsity staff worker Paul Byer is credited with developing the Manuscript Study method of inductive Bible study,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://madden.customer.netspace.net.au/history.html |title=History |publisher=Madden.customer.netspace.net.au |date=1986-10-27 |accessdate=February 24, 2012}}</ref> a useful tool for inductive Bible studies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.intervarsity.org/bible-studies/inductive-bible-study-hints |title=Inductive Bible Study Hints - Bible Studies |publisher=InterVarsity.org |date= |accessdate=February 24, 2012}}</ref> After graduating from the University of Southern California with a degree in architecture, Byer became one of the leading forces in InterVarsity, as both a campus staff worker and as the West Coast Regional Director, and was the developer of the Manuscript Study method.<ref>[http://regions.ivcf.org/training/318 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050305201813/http://regions.ivcf.org/training/318 |date=March 5, 2005 }}</ref> Through his innovative approach to Bible Study, extensive mentoring, and long tenure he helped shape the theology and culture of the entire movement.  The Manuscript Study method continues to be used heavily by InterVarsity as one of many tools to help students investigate and learn from the teachings of the Bible.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bibleseo.com/bible-study-methods/manuscript-bible-study-method/ |title=Manuscript Bible Study Method &#124; Bible Study Lessons &#124; Free Inductive Study Guide, Topics & Tools |publisher=Bibleseo.com |date= |accessdate=February 24, 2012}}</ref>\n\nOther early staff members laid more of the foundation for InterVarsity's commitment to Bible study. Jane Hollingsworth learned inductive Bible study in seminary and in turn trained staff members in the 1940s. She wrote the first Bible study guide published by InterVarsity, ''Discovering the Gospel of Mark''. In the 1960s, veteran staff member Barbara Boyd developed what became the Bible and Life Training Courses, experienced by decades of students.<ref>For Christ and the University by Keith and Gladys Hunt, InterVarsity Press, 1991</ref>\n\n===Missions===\nInterVarsity students regularly participate in both long- and short-term missions projects. During each summer several hundred students participate in a \"Global Urban Trek,\" working in some of the poorest cities of the world, or \"Global Programs,\" lingua-cultural or service ministries overseas. InterVarsity also sponsors \"Urban Programs\" in more than two dozen cities in the United States, helping students understand God's love for all people by working alongside existing ministries in the inner city.\n\nInterVarsity, as a member movement, participates in the global student ministry network, the [[International Fellowship of Evangelical Students]] (IFES), by sending staff and recent graduates to work under the authority of local IFES staff in countries around the world.\n\nInterVarsity, Inter-Varsity Canada, and Groupes Bibliques Universitaires et Collegiaux of French-speaking Canada co-host [[Urbana (convention)|Urbana Missions Conference]], a triennial student missions convention, named for the campus town where it was held for many years. Since the first Convention in 1946, nearly 269,000 attendees have heard the challenge to participate in God's global mission. In December 2006, approximately 16,000 attendees participated in the convention as it was held for the first time in St. Louis, Missouri. Of the approximately [http://intervarsity.org/news/new-generation-stories 16,000 attendees] at Urbana 15, 9,416 said yes to serving in a global or cross-cultural setting\u2014short-term, mid-term, and long-term combined, 9,254 said yes to regularly praying and interceding for the global church, and 5,418 said yes to continuing with others their Bible study of Matthew's Gospel that began at Urbana.\n\n===Training===\nInterVarsity operates several training centers, [[Campus by the Sea]] Catalina Island, CA; Toah Nipi, Rindge, NH; [[Cedar Campus]], Cedarville, MI; and, until recently, Bear Trap Ranch, Colorado Springs, CO. These camps are used for weekend conferences during the school year, week-long training sessions at the beginning and end of summer break, and faculty and alumni retreats.  Cedar Campus is the site of the InterVarsity Leadership Institute, a month-long summer program of Bible study, prayer and evangelism training.  In 2015, a total of 20,800 people attended events at InterVarsity's training centers.\n\nIn conjunction with InterVarsity's missions program, the training centers offer Student Training in Missions, STIM. This program seeks to prepare students for cross-cultural missions through a series of weekend programs that offer lecture, discussion and cross-cultural simulations.\n\n==InterVarsity Press==\n[[File:InterVarsity_Press_logo_New_2019.jpg|thumb|right|logo of InterVarsity Press]]\nIn 1947 the InterVarsity/USA Board of Trustees determined that the Fellowship should develop its own publishing arm.

Similar to ''[[Peg + Cat]]'' and ''[[Cyberchase]],'' other math-centered programs aired on PBS Kids, the series involves child characters using mathematical concepts (addition, multiplication, using data in graphs, etc.) to advance each episode's plot. The series was created by [[Tim McKeon]] and [[Adam Peltzman]] and is co-produced by [[Fred Rogers Productions]] and [[Sinking Ship Entertainment]] in association with [[TVOKids]] and [[Ici Radio-Canada T\u00e9l\u00e9]]. The series features child actors (whose characters are the employees of the \"Odd Squad\") who use indirect reasoning and basic math to solve and investigate strange happenings in their town. The series is a general [[satire]] of the [[police procedural]] and [[spy fiction]] genres and uses humor to teach the audience basic math skills and math-related topics. In the UK, the series airs on [[CBBC]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/cbbc/shows/odd-squad |title=Odd Squad - CBBC |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=2015-07-11}}</ref> In Latin America, it airs on [[Discovery Kids (Latin America)|Discovery Kids]].\n\n==Description==\nThe series follows the exploits of Odd Squad, an organization run entirely by children, that solves peculiar problems using math skills. In the first two seasons, it typically features two employees of the organization's investigation division that work in precinct 13579 of the organization\u2014Agents Olive ([[Dalila Bela]]) and Otto (Filip Geljo) in the first season and Olympia ([[Anna Cathcart]]) and Otis (Isaac Kragten) in the second season. Selected episodes feature other types of employees of the fictional organization, like security officers, so-called \"tube operators\" and scientists. The names of the employees nearly always start with the letter O.\n\nAgents are typically assigned cases by their boss, Ms. O ([[Millie Davis]]), and travel via a system of interconnected tubes to get to their destinations. They deduce the solution to the problem or how to detain the perpetrator by using basic mathematical principles that are typically the focus of the episode. Often, they cannot solve the problem at the scene and must go back to their precinct's headquarters or to the \"Mathroom,\" a sentient space that communicates through large [[paper fortune teller]]s and can unfold them to display information to help the agents see connections and better solve their case.\n\nAlong with math, agents also use \"gadgets\" designed by the scientists; in the first season, Agent Oscar (Sean Michael Kyer) heads the lab, gaining an assistant, Agent Oona (Olivia Presti), in early season two who eventually takes over the lab after Oscar is promoted. The characters also have to deal with a variety of recurring villains who often put a mathematical spin on their plots. The seal of the Odd Squad headquarters depicts a jackalope carrying a shield in front of it (bearing an image of the seal\u2014an instance of the [[Droste effect]]) and bananas at each side of it.\n\nThe third season, dubbed ''Odd Squad Mobile Unit,'' sees a setting change from precinct 13579 to a van; in this season, four agents who worked to find and protect a powerful 44-leaf clover are assigned by the Big O (Davis) to work in the van and travel the world solving cases where local precincts can't reach or need extra help.\n\n==Characters==\n===Main===\n* Agent Olive ([[Dalila Bela]], season 1): Referred to as a longtime employee of the Odd Squad, Olive began season one of the series adapting to working with and training her new partner, Otto. Olive is usually calm, brisk and serious. She has a morbid fear of pies, which she acquired after saving her organization's building from a pie-related disaster caused by her former partner, Todd. In the season one finale, Olive departs the series along with her partner, Otto, to run a different Odd Squad precinct as Ms. O.\n* Agent Otto (Filip Geljo, season 1): Olive's partner and, in the first episode, the newest employee of the organization. In contrast to his partner's more serious demeanor and personality, he is a more lenient, laid-back employee. Despite his lack of experience with his job, Otto frequently uncovers the facts needed to solve the case at hand, even doing so in the absence of his more experienced partner. In the season finale, Otto departs the series to run another Odd Squad office as Mr. O with his partner, Olive.\n* Big O<!-- Please limit this to the name seen in the credits (as of season 3: \"Big O\"); the prior names are described in the description of her character and don't need to be added to her character name to make it unwieldy.--> ([[Millie Davis]], seasons 1\u2013): Known as \"Ms. O\" (the title of any female head of an Odd Squad division) in the first two seasons, she is a very strict boss. She has the tendency to yell (a habit seen less frequently as the series progresses) and is often seen sipping a juice box. Despite appearing younger than most of the agents, Ms. O's tenure at the precinct and her actual age remains a mystery. In-show, it is revealed that her actual name is \"Oprah.\" In the season two finale, Ms. O is promoted to the rank of Big O, the leader of the entire Odd Squad organization.\n* Agent Oscar (Sean Michael Kyer, seasons 1\u20132): Oscar was the precinct's head [[scientist]], in charge of the [[laboratory]]. Other employees go to him for technical solutions to their problems. Oscar is depicted as being very intelligent and having a quirky and goofy personality. He departed from the series in the Season 2 episode \"Oscar Strikes Back,\" where he became the president of the organization's science division after the former president was dismissed for misconduct.\n* Agent Olympia ([[Anna Cathcart]], season 2): Introduced in the first episode of season two, Olympia joins the series to fill in the opening left by the departure of Olive in the season one finale. She was given early graduation from the organization's training academy. She is depicted as being very social and outgoing and having a generally happy and carefree personality.\n* Agent Otis (Isaac Kragten, season 2): As was the case with Agent Olympia, Agent Otis was introduced at the start of season two, brought in to fill the opening left by the departure of Otto in the season one finale. Unlike his partner, he has a more serious and socially-reserved personality. There are no records of him attending the organization's academy, but he is depicted as being the more seasoned member of the new team. He has a fear of [[duck]]s, revealed in the season two finale to be related to the fact he was once part of a family of villainous ducks. Ms. O took pity on Otis and trained him herself to become an Odd Squad agent.\n* Agent Oona (Olivia Presti, season 2): Initially Oscar's assistant, she takes up his position after his departure. Like her predecessor, she is depicted as having a quirky personality.\n* Agent Opal (Valentina Herrera, season 3): Originally stationed at a precinct in the Arctic with Omar, she is competitive with a strong desire to be working on cases important to combating oddness, viewing herself as the leader of OSMU.\n* Agent Omar (Jayce Alexander, season 3): Originally stationed in the Arctic with Opal, he is known to value friendship and connection with his fellow agents, often attempting to mediate or calm the waters among his team, though his tendency to do so can sometimes distract him from the mission at hand.\n* Agent Oswald (Gavin Maclver-Wright, season 3): Prior to being assigned to the Odd Squad Mobile Unit, Oswald worked as the only employee of the Odd Squad museum in New York City. Having spent the entirety of his career behind a desk, he is often excited to jump into tasks or cases.\n* Agent Orla (Alyssa Hidalgo, season 3): Orla joins the Odd Squad Mobile Unit after having spent 400 years in isolation at an ancient Odd Squad headquarters protecting the powerful 44-leaf clover. Because of her separation from society-at-large and her history standing guard, she is often unfamiliar with modern inventions and has a tendency to react to situations quickly and without forethought.\n\n===Recurring===\n====Odd Squad employees====\n{{example farm|section|date=October 2018}}\n<!-- Please be certain a character has been featured enough in the series that it is appropriate to include them here. Adding characters indiscriminately contributes to section bloat. -->\n* Dr. O ([[Peyton Kennedy]], seasons 1\u20132; Kaden Stephen, season 2): The precinct's resident medical employee who assists others with medical-related problems. She is known for her eccentric behavior and frequently says things that make no sense; often her dialogue references popular [[science-fiction]] series like ''[[Star Trek]]'' or ''[[Doctor Who]]''. It is revealed in-show that she was once a worker in the Odd Squad [[gift shop]], but became a doctor when the gift shop was shut down. After the original Dr. O leaves to work as a doctor in space, she is replaced with a new male doctor who previously worked in another department.\n* Agent Obfusco (Jaeden J. Noel, season 1): An Odd Squad agent and cross-cultural expert who speaks in obscure riddles, a characteristic intended to teach viewers how to understand word problems. He is eccentric and difficult for the other agents to understand, which leads them to try and avoid working with him.\n* Agent Ocean (Elijah Sandiford, season 2): The precinct's director of the 'Creature Room', which houses many bizarre creatures and plants which Odd Squad agents may need to know about. Ocean has a laid-back and easy-going personality.\n* Agent Octavia (Julia Lalonde, season 1): Agent Oz's partner. It was noted in an episode that she is one of the precinct's best employees. She is usually looking for her partner because he is invisible.\n* Oksana (Madeleine Barbeau, seasons 1\u20132): The precinct's sole resident cook. She has a deadpan and sarcastic personality.\n* Agent Olaf (Eshaan Buadwal, seasons 1\u2013): Agent Oren's partner. Olaf is happy-go-lucky but tends to appear very simple-minded. Despite this, he has shown to have moments of intelligence, often to the shock and amazement of his fellow agents. He shares Oren's penchant for laziness. He dreams of becoming a dentist. He has an unusual obsession with potatoes. Later on in the series, it is revealed that he is a [[werewolf]].\n* Agent Orchid ([[Michela Luci]], seasons 1\u2013): One of the younger agents. She tends to be extremely stubborn and is often sarcastic and difficult as well as cunning and manipulative.\n* Agent Oren (Brendan Heard, seasons 1\u2013): Agent Olaf's partner. Oren is depicted as snarky and arrogant. Oren and his partner have an ongoing rivalry with Olive and Otto. Oren has an unusual fear of pancakes and dreams of becoming an Odd Squad director and running his own precinct.\n* Agent Owen (Christian Distefano, seasons 1\u2013): The head of the precinct's Security department, in charge of defending against intruders and other vital protective measures of the surrounding town, the squad and its employees. He is frequently seen going on break.\n* Agent Orson (Nashton Avila, Nathan Avila. seasons 1-): One of the baby agents, he is an excellent driver and was frequent winner of the precinct's employee of the month award until he was found to have rigged the results. In the season two finale, Agent Orson is promoted to Mr. O after the former Ms. O is promoted to the rank of Big O.\n* Agent Ozlyn (Arista Arhin, season 2): Worker in the Security Department.\n* Agent Olly (Sasha Steiner, season 2): A former doctor who now assists Oksana with maintaining the building's break room and cafeteria.\n* Agent Xavier (Leonidas Castrounis, season 2) from Odd Squad's ''Department X Special Task Force'' who oversee the agency's work, enforce rules (similar to [[Internal affairs (law enforcement)|Internal Affairs]]) and have the power to temporarily shut Odd Squad down.\n* Agent Xena (Sheena Darnley, season 2) Agent Xavier's partner.\n\n====Others====\n* Delivery Debbie (Ashley Botting): A pizzeria owner who has appeared in numerous episodes and played a key part in the series movie, ''Odd Squad: The Movie'' (2016). Her arch rival is Delivery Doug who specializes in the sale of egg-salad sandwiches.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.secondcity.com/people/ashley-botting+ |title=Ashley Botting |publisher=The Second City |date= |accessdate=2017-07-21}}</ref>\n* Polly Graph (Ava Preston): A girl who runs a stand selling hot chocolate or lemonade, depending on the season, outside her house. Employees of the local 'Odd Squad' precinct frequently patronize her stand. She is very fond of graphs and has just the right visual representation to deal with the situation at hand. While she is not an agent, she offers data to employees who visit her stand. On occasion, she assists with cases and internal business within the organization.\n* Soundcheck (Lucas Meeuse, Matthew Armet, Thomas Alderson, Stephan Dickson): A fictitious and satirical boy band made up of Tony D., Danny T., Ringo, and Johnny J., and is well liked by most all the precinct employees. Songs by the group include ''Take Away Four,'' ''The Force of Gravity'' and ''Up, Down, Left, Right''. Sound Check as a group appears on the album ''Odd Squad: Stop the Music.''\n* Rivka (Meghan Allen): The caretaker for the unseen Baby Genius.  Agents meet with them in a dark alley, and have to give ''gifts'' that amuse Baby Genius, to get their help.\n\n==Villains==\n\n* Agent Ohlm (Jaiden Cannatelli, seasons 1-2): A seemingly slow-witted agent who briefly served as a partner for Agent Otto, later on partnering with Agent Orchid when Otto and Olive depart the precinct. Ohlm is best known for his unpredictability, causing confusion, and getting lost. In the season two finale, it's revealed that Ohlm is in reality a clever, intelligent, calculating individual, but played at being dumb in order to bring down Odd Squad out of spite for not immediately being granted a high-ranking position within it.\n*Fladam<ref name=\"PBSParentsFladam\">{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/parents/oddsquad/episodes/ |title=Odd Squad .

Similar to ''[[Peg + Cat]]'' and ''[[Cyberchase]],'' other math-centered programs aired on PBS Kids, the series involves child characters using mathematical concepts (addition, multiplication, using data in graphs, etc.) to advance each episode's plot. The series was created by [[Tim McKeon]] and [[Adam Peltzman]] and is co-produced by [[Fred Rogers Productions]] and [[Sinking Ship Entertainment]] in association with [[TVOKids]] and [[Ici Radio-Canada T\u00e9l\u00e9]]. The series features child actors (whose characters are the employees of the \"Odd Squad\") who use indirect reasoning and basic math to solve and investigate strange happenings in their town. The series is a general [[satire]] of the [[police procedural]] and [[spy fiction]] genres and uses humor to teach the audience basic math skills and math-related topics. In the UK, the series airs on [[CBBC]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/cbbc/shows/odd-squad |title=Odd Squad - CBBC |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=2015-07-11}}</ref> In Latin America, it airs on [[Discovery Kids (Latin America)|Discovery Kids]].\n\n==Description==\nThe series follows the exploits of Odd Squad, an organization run entirely by children, that solves peculiar problems using math skills. In the first two seasons, it typically features two employees of the organization's investigation division that work in precinct 13579 of the organization\u2014Agents Olive ([[Dalila Bela]]) and Otto (Filip Geljo) in the first season and Olympia ([[Anna Cathcart]]) and Otis (Isaac Kragten) in the second season. Selected episodes feature other types of employees of the fictional organization, like security officers, so-called \"tube operators\" and scientists. The names of the employees nearly always start with the letter O.\n\nAgents are typically assigned cases by their boss, Ms. O ([[Millie Davis]]), and travel via a system of interconnected tubes to get to their destinations. They deduce the solution to the problem or how to detain the perpetrator by using basic mathematical principles that are typically the focus of the episode. Often, they cannot solve the problem at the scene and must go back to their precinct's headquarters or to the \"Mathroom,\" a sentient space that communicates through large [[paper fortune teller]]s and can unfold them to display information to help the agents see connections and better solve their case.\n\nAlong with math, agents also use \"gadgets\" designed by the scientists; in the first season, Agent Oscar (Sean Michael Kyer) heads the lab, gaining an assistant, Agent Oona (Olivia Presti), in early season two who eventually takes over the lab after Oscar is promoted. The characters also have to deal with a variety of recurring villains who often put a mathematical spin on their plots. The seal of the Odd Squad headquarters depicts a jackalope carrying a shield in front of it (bearing an image of the seal\u2014an instance of the [[Droste effect]]) and bananas at each side of it.\n\nThe third season, dubbed ''Odd Squad Mobile Unit,'' sees a setting change from precinct 13579 to a van; in this season, four agents who worked to find and protect a powerful 44-leaf clover are assigned by the Big O (Davis) to work in the van and travel the world solving cases where local precincts can't reach or need extra help.\n\n==Characters==\n===Main===\n* Agent Olive ([[Dalila Bela]], season 1): Referred to as a longtime employee of the Odd Squad, Olive began season one of the series adapting to working with and training her new partner, Otto. Olive is usually calm, brisk and serious. She has a morbid fear of pies, which she acquired after saving her organization's building from a pie-related disaster caused by her former partner, Todd. In the season one finale, Olive departs the series along with her partner, Otto, to run a different Odd Squad precinct as Ms. O.\n* Agent Otto (Filip Geljo, season 1): Olive's partner and, in the first episode, the newest employee of the organization. In contrast to his partner's more serious demeanor and personality, he is a more lenient, laid-back employee. Despite his lack of experience with his job, Otto frequently uncovers the facts needed to solve the case at hand, even doing so in the absence of his more experienced partner. In the season finale, Otto departs the series to run another Odd Squad office as Mr. O with his partner, Olive.\n* Big O<!-- Please limit this to the name seen in the credits (as of season 3: \"Big O\"); the prior names are described in the description of her character and don't need to be added to her character name to make it unwieldy.--> ([[Millie Davis]], seasons 1\u2013): Known as \"Ms. O\" (the title of any female head of an Odd Squad division) in the first two seasons, she is a very strict boss. She has the tendency to yell (a habit seen less frequently as the series progresses) and is often seen sipping a juice box. Despite appearing younger than most of the agents, Ms. O's tenure at the precinct and her actual age remains a mystery. In-show, it is revealed that her actual name is \"Oprah.\" In the season two finale, Ms. O is promoted to the rank of Big O, the leader of the entire Odd Squad organization.\n* Agent Oscar (Sean Michael Kyer, seasons 1\u20132): Oscar was the precinct's head [[scientist]], in charge of the [[laboratory]]. Other employees go to him for technical solutions to their problems. Oscar is depicted as being very intelligent and having a quirky and goofy personality. He departed from the series in the Season 2 episode \"Oscar Strikes Back,\" where he became the president of the organization's science division after the former president was dismissed for misconduct.\n* Agent Olympia ([[Anna Cathcart]], season 2): Introduced in the first episode of season two, Olympia joins the series to fill in the opening left by the departure of Olive in the season one finale. She was given early graduation from the organization's training academy. She is depicted as being very social and outgoing and having a generally happy and carefree personality.\n* Agent Otis (Isaac Kragten, season 2): As was the case with Agent Olympia, Agent Otis was introduced at the start of season two, brought in to fill the opening left by the departure of Otto in the season one finale. Unlike his partner, he has a more serious and socially-reserved personality. There are no records of him attending the organization's academy, but he is depicted as being the more seasoned member of the new team. He has a fear of [[duck]]s, revealed in the season two finale to be related to the fact he was once part of a family of villainous ducks. Ms. O took pity on Otis and trained him herself to become an Odd Squad agent.\n* Agent Oona (Olivia Presti, season 2): Initially Oscar's assistant, she takes up his position after his departure. Like her predecessor, she is depicted as having a quirky personality.\n* Agent Opal (Valentina Herrera, season 3): Originally stationed at a precinct in the Arctic with Omar, she is competitive with a strong desire to be working on cases important to combating oddness, viewing herself as the leader of OSMU.\n* Agent Omar (Jayce Alexander, season 3): Originally stationed in the Arctic with Opal, he is known to value friendship and connection with his fellow agents, often attempting to mediate or calm the waters among his team, though his tendency to do so can sometimes distract him from the mission at hand.\n* Agent Oswald (Gavin Maclver-Wright, season 3): Prior to being assigned to the Odd Squad Mobile Unit, Oswald worked as the only employee of the Odd Squad museum in New York City. Having spent the entirety of his career behind a desk, he is often excited to jump into tasks or cases.\n* Agent Orla (Alyssa Hidalgo, season 3): Orla joins the Odd Squad Mobile Unit after having spent 400 years in isolation at an ancient Odd Squad headquarters protecting the powerful 44-leaf clover. Because of her separation from society-at-large and her history standing guard, she is often unfamiliar with modern inventions and has a tendency to react to situations quickly and without forethought.\n\n===Recurring===\n====Odd Squad employees====\n{{example farm|section|date=October 2018}}\n<!-- Please be certain a character has been featured enough in the series that it is appropriate to include them here. Adding characters indiscriminately contributes to section bloat. -->\n* Dr. O ([[Peyton Kennedy]], seasons 1\u20132; Kaden Stephen, season 2): The precinct's resident medical employee who assists others with medical-related problems. She is known for her eccentric behavior and frequently says things that make no sense; often her dialogue references popular [[science-fiction]] series like ''[[Star Trek]]'' or ''[[Doctor Who]]''. It is revealed in-show that she was once a worker in the Odd Squad [[gift shop]], but became a doctor when the gift shop was shut down. After the original Dr. O leaves to work as a doctor in space, she is replaced with a new male doctor who previously worked in another department.\n* Agent Obfusco (Jaeden J. Noel, season 1): An Odd Squad agent and cross-cultural expert who speaks in obscure riddles, a characteristic intended to teach viewers how to understand word problems. He is eccentric and difficult for the other agents to understand, which leads them to try and avoid working with him.\n* Agent Ocean (Elijah Sandiford, season 2): The precinct's director of the 'Creature Room', which houses many bizarre creatures and plants which Odd Squad agents may need to know about. Ocean has a laid-back and easy-going personality.\n* Agent Octavia (Julia Lalonde, season 1): Agent Oz's partner. It was noted in an episode that she is one of the precinct's best employees. She is usually looking for her partner because he is invisible.\n* Oksana (Madeleine Barbeau, seasons 1\u20132): The precinct's sole resident cook. She has a deadpan and sarcastic personality.\n* Agent Olaf (Eshaan Buadwal, seasons 1\u2013): Agent Oren's partner. Olaf is happy-go-lucky but tends to appear very simple-minded. Despite this, he has shown to have moments of intelligence, often to the shock and amazement of his fellow agents. He shares Oren's penchant for laziness. He dreams of becoming a dentist. He has an unusual obsession with potatoes. Later on in the series, it is revealed that he is a [[werewolf]].\n* Agent Orchid ([[Michela Luci]], seasons 1\u2013): One of the younger agents. She tends to be extremely stubborn and is often sarcastic and difficult as well as cunning and manipulative.\n* Agent Oren (Brendan Heard, seasons 1\u2013): Agent Olaf's partner. Oren is depicted as snarky and arrogant. Oren and his partner have an ongoing rivalry with Olive and Otto. Oren has an unusual fear of pancakes and dreams of becoming an Odd Squad director and running his own precinct.\n* Agent Owen (Christian Distefano, seasons 1\u2013): The head of the precinct's Security department, in charge of defending against intruders and other vital protective measures of the surrounding town, the squad and its employees.

The general industry of the country, being always in proportion to the capital which employs it, will not thereby be diminished [...] but only left to find out the way in which it can be employed with the greatest advantage.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=Adam|title=An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations|date=1776}}</ref>}}\n\nWriting several decades after Smith in 1808, [[Robert Torrens (economist)|Robert Torrens]] articulated a preliminary definition of comparative advantage as the loss from the closing of trade:\n{{quote|text=[I]f I wish to know the extent of the advantage, which arises to England, from her giving France a hundred pounds of [[broadcloth]], in exchange for a hundred pounds of lace, I take the quantity of lace which she has acquired by this transaction, and compare it with the quantity which she might, at the same expense of labour and capital, have acquired by manufacturing it at home. The lace that remains, beyond what the labour and capital employed on the cloth, might have fabricated at home, is the amount of the advantage which England derives from the exchange.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Torrens|first1=Lionel|title=The Economists Refuted and Other Early Economic Writings|year=1808|publisher=Kelley|location=New York|edition=1984|page=37}}</ref>}}\n[[Image:David ricardo.jpg|150px|right|thumb|David Ricardo]]\n\nIn 1817, [[David Ricardo]] published what has since become known as the theory of comparative advantage in his book ''[[On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation]]''.\n\n===Ricardo's example===\n[[File:Ricardo_example_of_comparative_advantage.svg|thumb|Graph illustrating Ricardo's example:<br />In case I (diamonds), each country spends 3600 hours to produce a mixture of cloth and wine.<br />In case II (squares), each country specializes in its comparative advantage, resulting in greater total output.]]\nIn a famous example, Ricardo considers a [[world economy]] consisting of two countries, [[Portugal]] and [[England]], each producing two goods of identical quality. In Portugal, the ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' more efficient country, it is possible to produce [[wine]] and [[cloth]] with less labor than it would take to produce the same quantities in England. However, the relative costs of producing those two goods differ between the countries.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Hours of work necessary to produce one unit\n|-\n! {{diagonal split header|Country|Produce}}\n! scope=\"col\" | Cloth\n! scope=\"col\" | Wine\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | '''England'''\n|100\n|120\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | '''Portugal'''\n|90\n|80\n|}\n\nIn this illustration, England could commit 100 hours of labor to produce one unit of cloth, or produce {{sfrac|5|6}} units of wine. Meanwhile, in comparison, Portugal could commit 90 hours of labor to produce one unit of cloth, or produce {{sfrac|9|8}} units of wine. So, Portugal possesses an ''absolute advantage'' in producing cloth due to fewer labor hours, but England has a ''comparative advantage'' in producing cloth due to lower opportunity cost.\n\nIn the absence of trade, England requires 220 hours of work to both produce and consume one unit each of cloth and wine while Portugal requires 170 hours of work to produce and consume the same quantities. England is more efficient at producing cloth than wine, and Portugal is more efficient at producing wine than cloth. So, if each country specializes in the good for which it has a comparative advantage, then the global production of both goods increases, for England can spend 220 labor hours to produce 2.2 units of cloth while Portugal can spend 170 hours to produce 2.125 units of wine. Moreover, if both countries specialize in the above manner and England trades a unit of its cloth for {{sfrac|5|6}} to {{sfrac|9|8}} units of Portugal's wine, then both countries can consume at least a unit each of cloth and wine, with 0 to 0.2 units of cloth and 0 to 0.125 units of wine remaining in each respective country to be consumed or exported. Consequently, both England and Portugal can consume more wine and cloth under free trade than in [[autarky]].\n\n===Ricardian model===\nThe '''Ricardian model''' is a [[general equilibrium]] mathematical model of [[international trade]]. Although the idea of the Ricardian model was first presented in the ''Essay on Profits'' (a single-commodity version) and then in the ''Principles'' (a multi-commodity version) by [[David Ricardo]], the first mathematical Ricardian model was published by [[William Whewell]] in 1833.<ref name=\"John Wood\">{{cite book |title= David Ricardo: Critical Assessments|last= Wood |first= John Cunningham|year= 1991 |publisher= Taylor & Francis |location= |isbn= 9780415063807|page= 312 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=h5GzUUfTL4sC&pg=PA312&dq=Ricardian+model#v=onepage&q=Ricardian%20model&f=false}}</ref> The earliest test of the Ricardian model was performed by G.D.A MacDougall, which was published in ''Economic Journal'' of 1951 and 1952.\n<ref name=\"Barbara Ingham\">{{cite book |title= International Economics: A European Focus|last= Ingham |first= Barbara|year= 2004 |publisher= Pearson Education |location= |isbn= 9780273655077|page= 22 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=zIaS9R7HUGIC&printsec=frontcover&dq=international+economics#v=onepage&q=RIcardian%20model&f=false}}</ref> In the Ricardian model, trade patterns depend on productivity differences.\n\nThe following is a typical modern interpretation of the classical Ricardian model.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Krugman|first1=Paul|last2=Obstfeld|first2=Maurice|title=International Economics: Theory and Policy|year=1988|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=New York|pages=27\u201336|edition=2008}}</ref> In the interest of simplicity, it uses notation and definitions, such as opportunity cost, unavailable to Ricardo.\n\nThe world economy consists of two countries, Home and Foreign, which produce wine and cloth. Labor, the only factor of production, is [[labor mobility|mobile]] domestically but not internationally; there may be migration between sectors but not between countries. We denote the labor force in Home by <math>\\textstyle L</math>, the amount of labor required to produce one unit of wine in Home by <math>\\textstyle a_{LW}</math>, and the amount of labor required to produce one unit of cloth in Home by <math>\\textstyle a_{LC}</math>. The total amount of wine and cloth produced in Home are <math>Q_W</math> and <math>Q_C</math> respectively. We denote the same variables for Foreign by appending a [[prime (symbol)|prime]]. For instance, <math>\\textstyle a'_{LW}</math> is the amount of labor needed to produce a unit of wine in Foreign.\n\nWe don't know if Home is more productive than Foreign in making cloth. That is, we don't know that <math>a_{LC}<a'_{LC}</math>. Similarly, we don't know if Home has an absolute advantage in wine. However, we will assume that Home is more ''relatively'' productive in cloth than Foreign:\n:<math>a_{LC}/a'_{LC}<a_{LW}/a'_{LW}.</math>\n\nEquivalently, we may assume that Home has a comparative advantage in cloth in the sense that it has a lower opportunity cost for cloth in terms of wine than Foreign:\n:<math>a_{LC}/a_{LW}<a'_{LC}/a'_{LW}.</math>\n\nIn the absence of trade, the relative price of cloth and wine in each country is determined solely by the relative labor cost of the goods. Hence the relative autarky price of cloth is <math>a_{LC}/a_{LW}</math> in Home and <math>a'_{LC}/a'_{LW}</math> in Foreign. With free trade, the price of cloth or wine in either country is the world price <math>P_C</math> or<math>P_W</math>.\n\nInstead of considering the world demand (or supply) for cloth and wine, we are interested in the world ''relative demand'' (or ''relative supply'') for cloth and wine, which we define as the ratio of the world demand (or supply) for cloth to the world demand (or supply) for wine. In general equilibrium, the world relative price <math>\\textstyle P_C/P_W</math> will be determined uniquely by the intersection of world relative demand <math>\\textstyle RD</math> and world relative supply <math>\\textstyle RS</math> curves.\n\n[[File:World relative supply and demand in the classical Ricardo model of one-factor international trade between two countries.svg|thumb|The demand for cloth relative to wine decreases with the relative price of cloth in terms of wine; the supply <math>RS</math> of cloth relative to wine increases with relative price. Two relative demand curves <math>RD_1</math> and <math>RD_2</math> are drawn for illustrative purposes.]]\nWe assume that the relative demand curve reflects substitution effects and is decreasing with respect to relative price. The behavior of the relative supply curve, however, warrants closer study. Recalling our original assumption that Home has a comparative advantage in cloth, we consider five possibilities for the relative quantity supplied at a given price.\n\n* If <math>\\textstyle P_C/P_W = a_{LC}/a_{LW}<a'_{LC}/a'_{LW}</math>, then Foreign specializes in wine, for the wage <math>P'_W/a'_{LW}</math> in the wine sector is greater than the wage <math>P'_C/a'_{LC}</math> in the cloth sector. However, Home workers are indifferent between working in either sector. As a result, the quantity supplied can take any value.\n* If <math>\\textstyle P_C/P_W < a_{LC}/a_{LW}<a'_{LC}/a'_{LW}</math>, then both Home and Foreign specialize in wine, for similar reasons as above, and so the quantity supplied is zero.\n* If <math>\\textstyle a_{LC}/a_{LW}<P_C/P_W < a'_{LC}/a'_{LW}</math>, then Home specializes in cloth whereas Foreign specializes in wine. The quantity supplied is given by the ratio <math>\\textstyle \\frac{L/a_{LC}}{L'/a'_{LW}}</math> of the world production of cloth to the world production of wine.\n* If <math>\\textstyle a_{LC}/a_{LW}<a'_{LC}/a'_{LW}<P_C/P_W</math>, then both Home and Foreign specialize in cloth. The quantity supplied tends to infinity as the quantity of wine supplied approaches zero.\n* If <math>\\textstyle a_{LC}/a_{LW}<a'_{LC}/a'_{LW}=P_C/P_W</math>, then Home specializes in cloth while Foreign workers are indifferent between sectors. Again, the relative quantity supplied can take any value.\n\n[[File:Consumption possibilities in the classical Ricardo model of one-factor international trade between two countries.svg|thumb|The blue triangle depicts Home's original production (and consumption) possibilities. By trading, Home can also consume bundles in the pink triangle despite facing the same productions possibility frontier.]]\nAs long as the relative demand is finite, the relative price is always bounded by the inequality\n:<math> a_{LC}/a_{LW}\\leq {P_C/P_W}\\leq {a'_{LC}/a'_{LW}}.</math>\n\nIn autarky, Home faces a [[production possibilities frontier|production constraint]] of the form\n:<math> a_{LC}Q_C+a_{LW}Q_W\\leq L,</math>\nfrom which it follows that Home's cloth consumption at the production possibilities frontier is\n:<math>Q_C=L/a_{LC}-(a_{LW}/a_{LC})Q_W</math>.\n\nWith free trade, Home produces cloth exclusively, an amount of which it exports in exchange for wine at the prevailing rate. Thus Home's overall consumption is now subject to the constraint\n:<math>a_{LC}Q_C+a_{LC}(P_W/P_C)Q_W\\leq L</math>\nwhile its cloth consumption at the ''consumption possibilities'' frontier is given by\n:<math>Q_C=L/a_{LC}-(P_W/P_C)Q_W\\geq  L/a_{LC}-(a_{LW}/a_{LC})Q_W</math>.\n\nA symmetric argument holds for Foreign. Therefore, by trading and specializing in a good for which it has a comparative advantage, each country can expand its consumption possibilities. Consumers can choose from bundles of wine and cloth that they could not have produced themselves in closed economies.\n\n=== Terms of trade ===\nTerms of trade is the rate at which one good could be traded for another. If both countries specialize in the good for which they have a comparative advantage then trade, the terms of trade for a good (that benefit both entities) will fall between each entities opportunity costs. In the example above one unit of cloth would trade for between <math>\\frac 56</math> units of wine and <math>\\frac 9 8</math> units of wine.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.reviewecon.com/comparative-advantage.html|title=AP Economics Review: Comparative Advantage, Absolute Advantage, and Terms of Trade|last=|first=|date=2016-09-28|website=www.reviewecon.com/comparative-advantage.html|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==Haberler's opportunity costs formulation==\nIn 1930 Gottfried Haberler detached the doctrine of comparative advantage from Ricardo's labor theory of value and provided a modern opportunity-cost formulation. Haberler's reformulation of comparative advantage revolutionized the theory of international trade and laid the conceptual groundwork of modern trade theories.\n\nHaberler's innovation was to reformulate the theory of comparative advantage such that the value of good X is measured in terms of the forgone units of production of good Y rather than the labor units necessary to produce good X, as in the Ricardian formulation. Haberler implemented this opportunity-cost formulation of comparative advantage by introducing the concept of a production possibility curve into international trade theory.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bernhofen|first1=Daniel|title=Gottfried haberler's 1930 reformulation of comparative advantage in retrospect|journal=Review of International Economics|date=2005|volume=13|issue=5|pages=997\u20131000|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9396.2005.00550.x}}</ref>\n\n==Modern theories==\nSince 1817, economists have attempted to generalize the [[Ricardian model]] and derive the principle of comparative advantage in broader settings, most notably in the [[neoclassical economics|neoclassical]] ''specific factors'' [[Richardo-Viner model|Ricardo-Viner]] (which allows for the model to include more factors than just labour)<ref>Krugman, P.R.; Obstfeld, M.; Melitz, M.J. (2015). \"International Trade. Theory and Policy\", 10th Edition. ''Pearson''</ref> and ''factor proportions'' [[Heckscher\u2013Ohlin model]]s. Subsequent developments in the [[new trade theory]], motivated in part by the empirical shortcomings of the H\u2013O model and its inability to explain [[intra-industry trade]], have provided an explanation for aspects of trade that are not accounted for by comparative advantage.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Maneschi|first1=Andrea|title=Comparative Advantage in International Trade: A Historical Perspective|year=1998|publisher=Elgar|location=Cheltenham|pages=6\u201313}}</ref> Nonetheless, economists like [[Alan Deardorff]],<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Deardorff|first1=Alan|title=The General Validity of the Law of Comparative Advantage|journal=Journal of Political Economy|date=Oct 1980|volume=88|issue=5|pages=941\u201357|doi=10.1086/260915}}</ref> [[Avinash Dixit]], [[Gottfried Haberler]], and [[Victor D.

It can be extended to a 2 countries/many commodities case, or a many countries/2 commodities case. Adding commodities in order to have a smooth continuum of goods is the major insight of the seminal paper by Dornbusch, Fisher, and Samuelson. In fact, inserting an increasing number of goods into the chain of comparative advantage makes the gaps between the ratios of the labor requirements negligible, in which case the three types of equilibria around any good in the original model collapse to the same outcome. It notably allows for transportation costs to be incorporated, although the framework remains restricted to two countries.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Dornbusch | first1 = R. | last2 = Fischer | first2 = S. | last3 = Samuelson | first3 = P.

Deardorff argues that the insights of comparative advantage remain valid if the theory is restated in terms of averages across all commodities. His models provide multiple insights on the correlations between vectors of trade and vectors with relative-autarky-price measures of comparative advantage. What has become to be known as the \"Deardorff's general law of comparative advantage\" is a model incorporating multiple goods, and which takes into account tariffs, transportation costs, and other obstacles to trade.\n\n===Alternative approaches===\nRecently, Y. Shiozawa succeeded in constructing a theory of international value in the tradition of Ricardo's [[cost-of-production theory of value]].<ref>Y.

(In practice, governments restrict international trade for a variety of reasons; under [[Ulysses S. Grant]], the US postponed opening up to free trade until its industries were up to strength, following the example set earlier by Britain.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chang|first=Ha-Joon|author-link=Ha-Joon Chang|date=December 2003|title=Kicking Away the Ladder: The \"Real\" History of Free Trade|url=|journal=FPIF Special Report|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref>) Nonetheless there is a large amount of [[empirical evidence|empirical]] work testing the predictions of comparative advantage. The empirical works usually involve testing predictions of a particular model. For example, the Ricardian model predicts that technological differences in countries result in differences in labor productivity. The differences in labor productivity in turn determine the comparative advantages across different countries. Testing the Ricardian model for instance involves looking at the relationship between relative labor productivity and international trade patterns. A country that is relatively efficient in producing shoes tends to export shoes.\n\n===Direct test: natural experiment of Japan===\nAssessing the validity of comparative advantage on a global scale with the examples of contemporary economies is analytically challenging because of the multiple factors driving globalization: indeed, investment, migration, and technological change play a role in addition to trade. Even if we could isolate the workings of open trade from other processes, establishing its causal impact also remains complicated: it would require a comparison with a counterfactual world without open trade. Considering the durability of different aspects of globalization, it is hard to assess the sole impact of open trade on a particular economy.\n\n[[Daniel Bernhofen]] and John Brown have attempted to address this issue, by using a natural experiment of a sudden transition to open trade in a market economy. They focus on the case of Japan.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bernhofen|first1=Daniel|last2=Brown|first2=John|title=A Direct Test of the Theory of Comparative Advantage: The Case of Japan|journal=Journal of Political Economy|date=2004|volume=112|issue=1|pages=48\u201367|doi=10.1086/379944}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bernhofen|first1=Daniel|last2=Brown|first2=John|title=An Empirical Assessment of the Comparative Advantage Gains from Trade: Evidence from Japan|journal=American Economic Review|date=2005|volume=95|issue=1|pages=208\u2013225|doi=10.1257/0002828053828491}}</ref> The Japanese economy indeed developed over several centuries under autarky and a quasi-isolation from international trade but was, by the mid-19th century, a sophisticated market economy with a population of 30 million. Under Western military pressure, Japan opened its economy to foreign trade through a series of [[unequal treaties]].\n\nIn 1859, the treaties limited tariffs to 5% and opened trade to Westerners. Considering that the transition from autarky, or self-sufficiency, to open trade was brutal, few changes to the fundamentals of the economy occurred in the first 20 years of trade. The general law of comparative advantage theorizes that an economy should, on average, export goods with low self-sufficiency prices and import goods with high self-sufficiency prices. Bernhofen and Brown found that by 1869, the price of Japan's main export, silk and derivatives, saw a 100% increase in real terms, while the prices of numerous imported goods declined of 30-75%. In the next decade, the ratio of imports to gross domestic product reached 4%.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bernhofen|first1=Daniel|last2=John|first2=Brown|title=Testing the General Validity of the Heckscher-Ohlin Theorem|journal=American Economic Journal: Microeconomics|date=2016|volume=8|issue=4|pages=54\u201390|doi=10.1257/mic.20130126}}</ref>\n\n===Structural estimation===\nAnother important way of demonstrating the validity of comparative advantage has consisted in 'structural estimation' approaches. These approaches have built on the Ricardian formulation of two goods for two countries and subsequent models with many goods or many countries. The aim has been to reach a formulation accounting for both multiple goods and multiple countries, in order to reflect real-world conditions more accurately. Jonathan Eaton and Samuel Kortum underlined that a convincing model needed to incorporate the idea of a 'continuum of goods' developed by Dornbusch et al. for both goods and countries. They were able to do so by allowing for an arbitrary (integer) number i of countries, and dealing exclusively with unit labor requirements for each good (one for each point on the unit interval) in each country (of which there are i).<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Eaton|first1=Jonathan|last2=Kortum|first2=Samuel|title=Putting Ricardo to Work\u2020|journal=Journal of Economic Perspectives|date=Spring 2012|volume=26|issue=2|pages=65\u201390|doi=10.1257/jep.26.2.65}}</ref>\n\n===Earlier empirical work===\nTwo of the first tests of comparative advantage were by MacDougall (1951, 1952).<ref>{{cite news | author=MacDougall, G.

In older economic terms, comparative advantage has been opposed by [[mercantilism]] and [[economic nationalism]]. These argue instead that while a country may initially be comparatively disadvantaged in a given industry (such as Japanese cars in the 1950s), countries should shelter and invest in industries until they become globally competitive. Further, they argue that comparative advantage, as stated, is a static theory \u2013 it does not account for the possibility of advantage changing through investment or economic development, and thus does not provide guidance for long-term economic development.\n\nMuch has been written since Ricardo as commerce has evolved and cross-border trade has become more complicated. Today trade policy tends to focus more on \"[[competitive advantage]]\" as opposed to \"comparative advantage\". One of the most in-depth research undertakings on \"competitive advantage\" was conducted in the 1980s as part of the [[Reagan administration]]'s [[Project Socrates]] to establish the foundation for a technology-based competitive strategy development system that could be used for guiding international trade policy.\n\n==Criticism==\nSeveral arguments have been advanced against using comparative advantage as a justification for advocating free trade, and they have gained an audience among economists. For example, [[James Brander]] and [[Barbara Spencer]] demonstrated how, in a strategic setting where a few firms compete for the world market, export subsidies and import restrictions can keep foreign firms from competing with national firms, increasing welfare in the country implementing these so-called strategic trade policies.<ref>{{cite news |last=Krugman |first=Paul R. |title=Is Free Trade Passe? |journal=[[Journal of Economic Perspectives]] |year=1987 |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=131\u201344}}</ref>\n\nHowever, the overwhelming consensus of the economics profession remains that while these arguments against comparative advantage are theoretically valid under certain conditions or assumptions, these assumptions do not usually hold. Thus, these arguments should not be used to guide trade policy.<ref>{{cite news |last=Irwin |first=Douglas. |title=Retrospectives: Challenges to Free Trade |journal=[[Journal of Economic Perspectives]] |year=1991 |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=201\u201308}}</ref> [[Gregory Mankiw]], chairman of the Harvard Economics Department, has stated: \u2033Few propositions command as much consensus among professional economists as that open world trade increases economic growth and raises living standards.\u2033<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2006/05/outsourcing-redux.html| author=Mankiw, N.G. |title=Outsourcing Redux|website= Greg Mankiw's Blog: Random Observations for Students of Economics|date=May 7, 2006}}</ref>\n\nThere are some economists who dispute the claims of the benefit of comparative advantage. [[James K. Galbraith]] has stated that \"free trade has attained the status of a god\" and that \"{{nbsp}}... none of the world's most successful trading regions, including Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and now mainland China, reached their current status by adopting [[neoliberal]] trading rules.\" He argues that \"{{nbsp}}... comparative advantage is based upon the concept of [[constant returns]]: the idea that you can double or triple the output of any good simply by doubling or tripling the inputs. But this is not generally the case. For manufactured products, increasing returns, learning, and technical change are the rule, not the exception; the cost of production falls with experience. With increasing returns, the lowest cost will be incurred by the country that starts earliest and moves fastest on any particular line. Potential competitors have to protect their own industries if they wish them to survive long enough to achieve competitive scale.\"<ref>James K. Galbraith, The Predator State, Free Press, 2008, pp. 68\u201369</ref> According to Galbraith, nations trapped into specializing in agriculture are condemned to perpetual poverty, as agriculture is dependent on land, a finite non-increasing natural resource. Galbraith summarizes: \"Comparative advantage has very little practical use for trade strategy. Diversification, not specialization, is the main path out of underdevelopment, and effective diversification requires a strategic approach to trade policy. It cannot mean walling off the outside world, but it is also a goal not easily pursued under a dogmatic commitment to free trade.\"<ref>{{Cite book|url=|title=The Predator State: How conservatives abandoned the free market and why liberals should too|last=K.|first=Galbraith, James|publisher=|year=2008|isbn=9781416566830|edition=First Free Press hardcover|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/predatorstatehow00galb/page/70 70]|oclc=192109752|author-link=James K.

When the union with Great Britain was formed in 1800, Irish textile industries protected by tariffs were exposed to world markets where England had a comparative advantage in technology, experience and scale of operation which devastated the Irish industry. Ireland was forced to specialize in the export of grain while the displaced Irish labor was forced into subsistence farming and relying on the potato for survival. When the potato blight occurred the resulting famine killed at least one million Irish in one of the worst famines in European history. As Woodham-Smith would later comment, \"the Irish peasant was told to replace the potato by eating his grain, but [[Sir Charles Trevelyan, 1st Baronet|Trevelyan]] once again refused to take any steps to curb the export of food from Ireland. 'Do not encourage the idea of prohibiting exports,' he wrote, on September 3, (1846) 'perfect free trade is the right course'.\"<ref>[[Cecil Woodham-Smith]], ''[[The Great Hunger: Ireland 1845\u20131849]]'', 1962, pp. 49, 100, 118</ref>\n\nFree trade is based on the theory of [[comparative advantage]]. The classical and neoclassical formulations of comparative advantage theory differ in the tools they use but share the same basis and logic. Comparative advantage theory says that market forces lead all factors of production to their best use in the economy. It indicates that international free trade would be beneficial for all participating countries as well as for the world as a whole because they could increase their overall production and consume more by specializing according to their comparative advantages. Goods would become cheaper and available in larger quantities.  Moreover, this specialization would not be the result of chance or political intent, but would be automatic. However according to non-neoclassical economists, the theory is based on assumptions that are neither theoretically nor empirically valid.<ref name=\":28\">{{cite thesis|last1=Schumacher|first1=Reinhard |title=Free Trade and Absolute and Comparative Advantage|date=2012|publisher=University of Potsdam|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U5nPkWSVpzQC&printsec=frontcover&hl=en&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref><ref name=\":27\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sudoc.abes.fr/xslt/DB=2.1/SET=3/TTL=1//CLK?IKT=1016&TRM=Les+fondements+non+neoclassiques+du+protectionnisme&COOKIE=U10178,Klecteurweb,I250,B341720009+,SY,NLECTEUR+WEBOPC,D2.1,Efd7f43b5-38f,A,H,R208.80.154.49,FY|title=Les fondements non neoclassiques du protectionnisme|first=Max|last=Maurin|date=14 April 2019|publisher=|access-date=14 April 2019|via=Library Catalog - www.sudoc.abes.fr}}</ref>\n\n;International mobility of capital and labour\nThe international immobility of labour and capital is essential to the theory of comparative advantage. Without this, there would be no reason for international free trade to be regulated by comparative advantages. Classical and neoclassical economists all assume that labour and capital do not circulate between nations. At the international level, only the goods produced can move freely, with capital and labour trapped in countries. David Ricardo was aware that the international immobility of labour and capital is an indispensable hypothesis. He devoted half of his explanation of the theory to it in his book. He even explained that if labour and capital could move internationally, then comparative advantages could not determine international trade. Ricardo assumed that the reasons for the immobility of the capital would be:<ref name=\":28\" /><ref name=\":27\" />\n{{Quote|text=\"the fancied or real insecurity of capital, when not under the immediate control of its owner, together with the natural disinclination which every man has to quit the country of his birth and connexions, and intrust himself with all his habits fixed, to a strange government and new laws\"}}\n\nNeoclassical economists, for their part, argue that the scale of these movements of workers and capital is negligible. They developed the theory of price compensation by factor that makes these movements superfluous.\nIn practice, however, workers move in large numbers from one country to another. Today, labour migration is truly a global phenomenon. And, with the reduction in transport and communication costs, capital has become increasingly mobile and frequently moves from one country to another. Moreover, the neoclassical assumption that factors are trapped at the national level has no theoretical basis and the assumption of factor price equalisation cannot justify international immobility. Moreover, there is no evidence that factor prices are equal worldwide. Comparative advantages cannot therefore determine the structure of international trade.<ref name=\":28\" /><ref name=\":27\" />\n\nIf they are internationally mobile and the most productive use of factors is in another country, then free trade will lead them to migrate to that country. This will benefit the nation to which they emigrate, but not necessarily the others.\n\n;Externalities\nAn externality is the term used when the price of a product does not reflect its cost or real economic value. The classic negative externality is environmental degradation, which reduces the value of natural resources without increasing the price of the product that has caused them harm. The classic positive externality is technological encroachment, where one company's invention of a product allows others to copy or build on it, generating wealth that the original company cannot capture. If prices are wrong due to positive or negative externalities, free trade will produce sub-optimal results.<ref name=\":28\" /><ref name=\":27\" />\n\nFor example, goods from a country with lax pollution standards will be too cheap. As a result, its trading partners will import too much. And the exporting country will export too much, concentrating its economy too much in industries that are not as profitable as they seem, ignoring the damage caused by pollution.\n\nOn the positive externalities, if an industry generates technological spinoffs for the rest of the economy, then free trade can let that industry be destroyed by foreign competition because the economy ignores its hidden value. Some industries generate new technologies, allow improvements in other industries and stimulate technological advances throughout the economy; losing these industries means losing all industries that would have resulted in the future.<ref name=\":28\" /><ref name=\":27\" />\n\n;Cross-industrial movement of productive resources\nComparative advantage theory deals with the best use of resources and how to put the economy to its best use. But this implies that the resources used to manufacture one product can be used to produce another object. If they cannot, imports will not push the economy into industries better suited to its comparative advantage and will only destroy existing industries.<ref name=\":28\" /><ref name=\":27\" />\n\nFor example, when workers cannot move from one industry to another\u2014usually because they do not have the right skills or do not live in the right place\u2014changes in the economy's comparative advantage will not shift them to a more appropriate industry, but rather to unemployment or precarious and unproductive jobs.<ref name=\":28\" /><ref name=\":27\" />\n\n;Static vs. dynamic gains via international trade\nComparative advantage theory allows for a \"static\" and not a \"dynamic\" analysis of the economy. That is, it examines the facts at a single point in time and determines the best response to those facts at that point in time, given our productivity in various industries. But when it comes to long-term growth, it says nothing about how the facts can change tomorrow and how they can be changed in someone's favour. It does not indicate how best to transform factors of production into more productive factors in the future.<ref name=\":28\" /><ref name=\":27\" />\n\nAccording to theory, the only advantage of international trade is that goods become cheaper and available in larger quantities. Improving the static efficiency of existing resources would therefore be the only advantage of international trade. And the neoclassical formulation assumes that the factors of production are given only exogenously. Exogenous changes can come from population growth, industrial policies, the rate of capital accumulation (propensity for security) and technological inventions, among others. Dynamic developments endogenous to trade such as economic growth are not integrated into Ricardo's theory. And this is not affected by what is called \"dynamic comparative advantage\". In these models, comparative advantages develop and change over time, but this change is not the result of trade itself, but of a change in exogenous factors.<ref name=\":28\" /><ref name=\":27\" />\n\nHowever, the world, and in particular the industrialized countries, are characterized by dynamic gains endogenous to trade, such as technological growth that has led to an increase in the standard of living and wealth of the industrialized world. In addition, dynamic gains are more important than static gains.\n\n;Balanced trade and adjustment mechanisms\nA crucial assumption in both the classical and neoclassical formulation of comparative advantage theory is that trade is balanced, which means that the value of imports is equal to the value of each country's exports. The volume of trade may change, but international trade will always be balanced at least after a certain adjustment period. The balance of trade is essential for theory because the resulting adjustment mechanism is responsible for transforming the comparative advantages of production costs into absolute price advantages. And this is necessary because it is the absolute price differences that determine the international flow of goods. Since consumers buy a good from the one who sells it cheapest, comparative advantages in terms of production costs must be transformed into absolute price advantages. In the case of floating exchange rates, it is the exchange rate adjustment mechanism that is responsible for this transformation of comparative advantages into absolute price advantages. In the case of fixed exchange rates, neoclassical theory suggests that trade is balanced by changes in wage rates.<ref name=\":28\" /><ref name=\":27\" />\n\nSo if trade were not balanced in itself and if there were no adjustment mechanism, there would be no reason to achieve a comparative advantage. However, trade imbalances are the norm and balanced trade is in practice only an exception. In addition, financial crises such as the Asian crisis of the 1990s show that balance of payments imbalances are rarely benign and do not self-regulate. There is no adjustment mechanism in practice. Comparative advantages do not turn into price differences and therefore cannot explain international trade flows.<ref name=\":28\" /><ref name=\":27\" />\n\nThus, theory can very easily recommend a trade policy that gives us the highest possible standard of living in the short term but none in the long term. This is what happens when a nation runs a trade deficit, which necessarily means that it goes into debt with foreigners or sells its existing assets to them. Thus, the nation applies a frenzy of consumption in the short term followed by a long-term decline.\n\n;International trade as bartering\nThe assumption that trade will always be balanced is a corollary of the fact that trade is understood as barter. The definition of international trade as barter trade is the basis for the assumption of balanced trade. Ricardo insists that international trade takes place as if it were purely a barter trade, a presumption that is maintained by subsequent classical and neoclassical economists. The quantity of money theory, which Ricardo uses, assumes that money is neutral and neglects the velocity  of a currency. Money has only one function in international trade, namely as a means of exchange to facilitate trade.<ref name=\":28\" /><ref name=\":27\" />\n\nIn practice, however, the velocity  of circulation is not constant and the quantity of money is not neutral for the real economy. A capitalist world is not characterized by a barter economy but by a market economy. The main difference in the context of international trade is that sales and purchases no longer necessarily have to coincide. The seller is not necessarily obliged to buy immediately. Thus, money is not only a means of exchange. It is above all a means of payment and is also used to store value, settle debts and transfer wealth. Thus, unlike the barter hypothesis of the comparative advantage theory, money is not a commodity like any other. Rather, it is of practical importance to specifically own money rather than any commodity. And money as a store of value in a world of uncertainty has a significant influence on the motives and decisions of wealth holders and producers.<ref name=\":28\" /><ref name=\":27\" />\n\n;Using labour and capital to their full potential\nRicardo and later classical economists assume that labour tends towards full employment and that capital is always fully used in a liberalized economy, because no capital owner will leave its capital unused but will always seek to make a profit from it. That there is no limit to the use of capital is a consequence of Jean-Baptiste Say's law, which presumes that production is limited only by resources and is also adopted by neoclassical economists.<ref name=\":28\" /><ref name=\":27\" />\n\nFrom a theoretical point of view, comparative advantage theory must assume that labour or capital is used to its full potential and that resources limit production. There are two reasons for this: the realization of gains through international trade and the adjustment mechanism. In addition, this assumption is necessary for the concept of opportunity costs. If unemployment (or underutilized resources) exists, there are no opportunity costs, because the production of one good can be increased without reducing the production of another good. Since comparative advantages are determined by opportunity costs in the neoclassical formulation, these cannot be calculated and this formulation would lose its logical basis.<ref name=\":28\" /><ref name=\":27\" />\n\nIf a country's resources were not fully utilized, production and consumption could be increased at the national level without participating in international trade. The whole raison d'\u00eatre of international trade would disappear, as would the possible gains. In this case, a State could even earn more by refraining from participating in international trade and stimulating domestic production, as this would allow it to employ more labour and capital and increase national income. Moreover, any adjustment mechanism underlying the theory no longer works if unemployment exists.<ref name=\":28\" /><ref name=\":27\" />\n\nIn practice, however, the world is characterised by unemployment. Unemployment and underemployment of capital and labour are not a short-term phenomenon, but it is common and widespread. Unemployment and untapped resources are more the rule than the exception.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Business and economics}}\n* [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]]\n* [[Keynesian beauty contest]]\n* [[Resource curse]]\n* [[Revealed comparative advantage]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* {{cite journal | last1 = Bernhofen | first1 = Daniel M | year = 2005 | title = Gottfried haberler's 1930 reformulation of comparative advantage in retrospect | url = | journal = Review of International Economics | volume = 13 | issue = 5| pages = 997\u20131000 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-9396.2005.00550.x}}\n* {{cite journal | last1 = Bernhofen | first1 = Daniel M. | last2 = Brown | first2 = John C. | year = 2004 | title = A Direct Test of the Theory of Comparative Advantage: The Case of Japan | url = | journal = Journal of Political Economy | volume = 112 | issue = 1| pages = 48\u201367 | doi=10.1086/379944| citeseerx = 10.1.1.194.9649 }}\n* {{cite journal | last1 = Bernhofen | first1 = Daniel M. | last2 = Brown | first2 = John C. | year = 2005 | title = An Empirical Assessment of the Comparative Advantage Gains from Trade: Evidence from Japan | url = | journal = American Economic Review | volume = 95 | issue = 1| pages = 208\u201325 | doi=10.1257/0002828053828491}}\n* {{cite journal | last1 = Bernhofen | first1 = Daniel M. | last2 = Brown | first2 = John C. | year = 2016 | title = Testing the General Validity of the Heckscher-Ohlin Theorem | url = | journal = American Economic Journal: Microeconomics | volume = 8 | issue = 4| pages = 54\u201390 | doi=10.1257/mic.20130126}}\n* {{cite journal | last1 = Findlay | first1 = Ronald | year = 1987 | title = Comparative Advantage | url = | journal = The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 514\u201317 }}\n* Markusen, Melvin, Kaempfer and Maskus, \"International Trade: Theory and Evidence\"\n* Hardwick, Khan and Langmead (1990).

In Portugal, the ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' more efficient country, it is possible to produce [[wine]] and [[cloth]] with less labor than it would take to produce the same quantities in England. However, the relative costs of producing those two goods differ between the countries.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Hours of work necessary to produce one unit\n|-\n! {{diagonal split header|Country|Produce}}\n! scope=\"col\" | Cloth\n! scope=\"col\" | Wine\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | '''England'''\n|100\n|120\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | '''Portugal'''\n|90\n|80\n|}\n\nIn this illustration, England could commit 100 hours of labor to produce one unit of cloth, or produce {{sfrac|5|6}} units of wine. Meanwhile, in comparison, Portugal could commit 90 hours of labor to produce one unit of cloth, or produce {{sfrac|9|8}} units of wine. So, Portugal possesses an ''absolute advantage'' in producing cloth due to fewer labor hours, but England has a ''comparative advantage'' in producing cloth due to lower opportunity cost.\n\nIn the absence of trade, England requires 220 hours of work to both produce and consume one unit each of cloth and wine while Portugal requires 170 hours of work to produce and consume the same quantities. England is more efficient at producing cloth than wine, and Portugal is more efficient at producing wine than cloth. So, if each country specializes in the good for which it has a comparative advantage, then the global production of both goods increases, for England can spend 220 labor hours to produce 2.2 units of cloth while Portugal can spend 170 hours to produce 2.125 units of wine. Moreover, if both countries specialize in the above manner and England trades a unit of its cloth for {{sfrac|5|6}} to {{sfrac|9|8}} units of Portugal's wine, then both countries can consume at least a unit each of cloth and wine, with 0 to 0.2 units of cloth and 0 to 0.125 units of wine remaining in each respective country to be consumed or exported. Consequently, both England and Portugal can consume more wine and cloth under free trade than in [[autarky]].\n\n===Ricardian model===\nThe '''Ricardian model''' is a [[general equilibrium]] mathematical model of [[international trade]].

We denote the labor force in Home by <math>\\textstyle L</math>, the amount of labor required to produce one unit of wine in Home by <math>\\textstyle a_{LW}</math>, and the amount of labor required to produce one unit of cloth in Home by <math>\\textstyle a_{LC}</math>. The total amount of wine and cloth produced in Home are <math>Q_W</math> and <math>Q_C</math> respectively. We denote the same variables for Foreign by appending a [[prime (symbol)|prime]]. For instance, <math>\\textstyle a'_{LW}</math> is the amount of labor needed to produce a unit of wine in Foreign.\n\nWe don't know if Home is more productive than Foreign in making cloth. That is, we don't know that <math>a_{LC}<a'_{LC}</math>. Similarly, we don't know if Home has an absolute advantage in wine. However, we will assume that Home is more ''relatively'' productive in cloth than Foreign:\n:<math>a_{LC}/a'_{LC}<a_{LW}/a'_{LW}.</math>\n\nEquivalently, we may assume that Home has a comparative advantage in cloth in the sense that it has a lower opportunity cost for cloth in terms of wine than Foreign:\n:<math>a_{LC}/a_{LW}<a'_{LC}/a'_{LW}.</math>\n\nIn the absence of trade, the relative price of cloth and wine in each country is determined solely by the relative labor cost of the goods. Hence the relative autarky price of cloth is <math>a_{LC}/a_{LW}</math> in Home and <math>a'_{LC}/a'_{LW}</math> in Foreign. With free trade, the price of cloth or wine in either country is the world price <math>P_C</math> or<math>P_W</math>.\n\nInstead of considering the world demand (or supply) for cloth and wine, we are interested in the world ''relative demand'' (or ''relative supply'') for cloth and wine, which we define as the ratio of the world demand (or supply) for cloth to the world demand (or supply) for wine. In general equilibrium, the world relative price <math>\\textstyle P_C/P_W</math> will be determined uniquely by the intersection of world relative demand <math>\\textstyle RD</math> and world relative supply <math>\\textstyle RS</math> curves.\n\n[[File:World relative supply and demand in the classical Ricardo model of one-factor international trade between two countries.svg|thumb|The demand for cloth relative to wine decreases with the relative price of cloth in terms of wine; the supply <math>RS</math> of cloth relative to wine increases with relative price. Two relative demand curves <math>RD_1</math> and <math>RD_2</math> are drawn for illustrative purposes.]]\nWe assume that the relative demand curve reflects substitution effects and is decreasing with respect to relative price. The behavior of the relative supply curve, however, warrants closer study. Recalling our original assumption that Home has a comparative advantage in cloth, we consider five possibilities for the relative quantity supplied at a given price.\n\n* If <math>\\textstyle P_C/P_W = a_{LC}/a_{LW}<a'_{LC}/a'_{LW}</math>, then Foreign specializes in wine, for the wage <math>P'_W/a'_{LW}</math> in the wine sector is greater than the wage <math>P'_C/a'_{LC}</math> in the cloth sector. However, Home workers are indifferent between working in either sector. As a result, the quantity supplied can take any value.\n* If <math>\\textstyle P_C/P_W < a_{LC}/a_{LW}<a'_{LC}/a'_{LW}</math>, then both Home and Foreign specialize in wine, for similar reasons as above, and so the quantity supplied is zero.\n* If <math>\\textstyle a_{LC}/a_{LW}<P_C/P_W < a'_{LC}/a'_{LW}</math>, then Home specializes in cloth whereas Foreign specializes in wine. The quantity supplied is given by the ratio <math>\\textstyle \\frac{L/a_{LC}}{L'/a'_{LW}}</math> of the world production of cloth to the world production of wine.\n* If <math>\\textstyle a_{LC}/a_{LW}<a'_{LC}/a'_{LW}<P_C/P_W</math>, then both Home and Foreign specialize in cloth. The quantity supplied tends to infinity as the quantity of wine supplied approaches zero.\n* If <math>\\textstyle a_{LC}/a_{LW}<a'_{LC}/a'_{LW}=P_C/P_W</math>, then Home specializes in cloth while Foreign workers are indifferent between sectors. Again, the relative quantity supplied can take any value.\n\n[[File:Consumption possibilities in the classical Ricardo model of one-factor international trade between two countries.svg|thumb|The blue triangle depicts Home's original production (and consumption) possibilities. By trading, Home can also consume bundles in the pink triangle despite facing the same productions possibility frontier.]]\nAs long as the relative demand is finite, the relative price is always bounded by the inequality\n:<math> a_{LC}/a_{LW}\\leq {P_C/P_W}\\leq {a'_{LC}/a'_{LW}}.</math>\n\nIn autarky, Home faces a [[production possibilities frontier|production constraint]] of the form\n:<math> a_{LC}Q_C+a_{LW}Q_W\\leq L,</math>\nfrom which it follows that Home's cloth consumption at the production possibilities frontier is\n:<math>Q_C=L/a_{LC}-(a_{LW}/a_{LC})Q_W</math>.\n\nWith free trade, Home produces cloth exclusively, an amount of which it exports in exchange for wine at the prevailing rate. Thus Home's overall consumption is now subject to the constraint\n:<math>a_{LC}Q_C+a_{LC}(P_W/P_C)Q_W\\leq L</math>\nwhile its cloth consumption at the ''consumption possibilities'' frontier is given by\n:<math>Q_C=L/a_{LC}-(P_W/P_C)Q_W\\geq  L/a_{LC}-(a_{LW}/a_{LC})Q_W</math>.\n\nA symmetric argument holds for Foreign. Therefore, by trading and specializing in a good for which it has a comparative advantage, each country can expand its consumption possibilities. Consumers can choose from bundles of wine and cloth that they could not have produced themselves in closed economies.\n\n=== Terms of trade ===\nTerms of trade is the rate at which one good could be traded for another. If both countries specialize in the good for which they have a comparative advantage then trade, the terms of trade for a good (that benefit both entities) will fall between each entities opportunity costs. In the example above one unit of cloth would trade for between <math>\\frac 56</math> units of wine and <math>\\frac 9 8</math> units of wine.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.reviewecon.com/comparative-advantage.html|title=AP Economics Review: Comparative Advantage, Absolute Advantage, and Terms of Trade|last=|first=|date=2016-09-28|website=www.reviewecon.com/comparative-advantage.html|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==Haberler's opportunity costs formulation==\nIn 1930 Gottfried Haberler detached the doctrine of comparative advantage from Ricardo's labor theory of value and provided a modern opportunity-cost formulation. Haberler's reformulation of comparative advantage revolutionized the theory of international trade and laid the conceptual groundwork of modern trade theories.\n\nHaberler's innovation was to reformulate the theory of comparative advantage such that the value of good X is measured in terms of the forgone units of production of good Y rather than the labor units necessary to produce good X, as in the Ricardian formulation. Haberler implemented this opportunity-cost formulation of comparative advantage by introducing the concept of a production possibility curve into international trade theory.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bernhofen|first1=Daniel|title=Gottfried haberler's 1930 reformulation of comparative advantage in retrospect|journal=Review of International Economics|date=2005|volume=13|issue=5|pages=997\u20131000|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9396.2005.00550.x}}</ref>\n\n==Modern theories==\nSince 1817, economists have attempted to generalize the [[Ricardian model]] and derive the principle of comparative advantage in broader settings, most notably in the [[neoclassical economics|neoclassical]] ''specific factors'' [[Ricardo-Viner]] and ''factor proportions'' [[Heckscher\u2013Ohlin model]]s. Subsequent developments in the [[new trade theory]], motivated in part by the empirical shortcomings of the H\u2013O model and its inability to explain [[intra-industry trade]], have provided an explanation for aspects of trade that are not accounted for by comparative advantage.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Maneschi|first1=Andrea|title=Comparative Advantage in International Trade: A Historical Perspective|year=1998|publisher=Elgar|location=Cheltenham|pages=6\u201313}}</ref> Nonetheless, economists like [[Alan Deardorff]],<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Deardorff|first1=Alan|title=The General Validity of the Law of Comparative Advantage|journal=Journal of Political Economy|date=Oct 1980|volume=88|issue=5|pages=941\u201357|doi=10.1086/260915}}</ref> [[Avinash Dixit]], [[Gottfried Haberler]], and [[Victor D.

It can be extended to a 2 countries/many commodities case, or a many countries/2 commodities case. Adding commodities in order to have a smooth continuum of goods is the major insight of the seminal paper by Dornbusch, Fisher, and Samuelson. In fact, inserting an increasing number of goods into the chain of comparative advantage makes the gaps between the ratios of the labor requirements negligible, in which case the three types of equilibria around any good in the original model collapse to the same outcome. It notably allows for transportation costs to be incorporated, although the framework remains restricted to two countries.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Dornbusch | first1 = R. | last2 = Fischer | first2 = S. | last3 = Samuelson | first3 = P.

Deardorff argues that the insights of comparative advantage remain valid if the theory is restated in terms of averages across all commodities. His models provide multiple insights on the correlations between vectors of trade and vectors with relative-autarky-price measures of comparative advantage. What has become to be known as the \"Deardorff's general law of comparative advantage\" is a model incorporating multiple goods, and which takes into account tariffs, transportation costs, and other obstacles to trade.\n\n===Alternative approaches===\nRecently, Y. Shiozawa succeeded in constructing a theory of international value in the tradition of Ricardo's [[cost-of-production theory of value]].<ref>Y.

(In practice, governments restrict international trade for a variety of reasons; under [[Ulysses S. Grant]], the US postponed opening up to free trade until its industries were up to strength, following the example set earlier by Britain.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chang|first=Ha-Joon|author-link=Ha-Joon Chang|date=December 2003|title=Kicking Away the Ladder: The \"Real\" History of Free Trade|url=|journal=FPIF Special Report|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref>) Nonetheless there is a large amount of [[empirical evidence|empirical]] work testing the predictions of comparative advantage. The empirical works usually involve testing predictions of a particular model. For example, the Ricardian model predicts that technological differences in countries result in differences in labor productivity. The differences in labor productivity in turn determine the comparative advantages across different countries. Testing the Ricardian model for instance involves looking at the relationship between relative labor productivity and international trade patterns. A country that is relatively efficient in producing shoes tends to export shoes.\n\n===Direct test: natural experiment of Japan===\nAssessing the validity of comparative advantage on a global scale with the examples of contemporary economies is analytically challenging because of the multiple factors driving globalization: indeed, investment, migration, and technological change play a role in addition to trade. Even if we could isolate the workings of open trade from other processes, establishing its causal impact also remains complicated: it would require a comparison with a counterfactual world without open trade. Considering the durability of different aspects of globalization, it is hard to assess the sole impact of open trade on a particular economy.\n\n[[Daniel Bernhofen]] and John Brown have attempted to address this issue, by using a natural experiment of a sudden transition to open trade in a market economy. They focus on the case of Japan.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bernhofen|first1=Daniel|last2=Brown|first2=John|title=A Direct Test of the Theory of Comparative Advantage: The Case of Japan|journal=Journal of Political Economy|date=2004|volume=112|issue=1|pages=48\u201367|doi=10.1086/379944}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bernhofen|first1=Daniel|last2=Brown|first2=John|title=An Empirical Assessment of the Comparative Advantage Gains from Trade: Evidence from Japan|journal=American Economic Review|date=2005|volume=95|issue=1|pages=208\u2013225|doi=10.1257/0002828053828491}}</ref> The Japanese economy indeed developed over several centuries under autarky and a quasi-isolation from international trade but was, by the mid-19th century, a sophisticated market economy with a population of 30 million. Under Western military pressure, Japan opened its economy to foreign trade through a series of [[unequal treaties]].\n\nIn 1859, the treaties limited tariffs to 5% and opened trade to Westerners. Considering that the transition from autarky, or self-sufficiency, to open trade was brutal, few changes to the fundamentals of the economy occurred in the first 20 years of trade. The general law of comparative advantage theorizes that an economy should, on average, export goods with low self-sufficiency prices and import goods with high self-sufficiency prices. Bernhofen and Brown found that by 1869, the price of Japan's main export, silk and derivatives, saw a 100% increase in real terms, while the prices of numerous imported goods declined of 30-75%. In the next decade, the ratio of imports to gross domestic product reached 4%.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bernhofen|first1=Daniel|last2=John|first2=Brown|title=Testing the General Validity of the Heckscher-Ohlin Theorem|journal=American Economic Journal: Microeconomics|date=2016|volume=8|issue=4|pages=54\u201390|doi=10.1257/mic.20130126}}</ref>\n\n===Structural estimation===\nAnother important way of demonstrating the validity of comparative advantage has consisted in 'structural estimation' approaches. These approaches have built on the Ricardian formulation of two goods for two countries and subsequent models with many goods or many countries. The aim has been to reach a formulation accounting for both multiple goods and multiple countries, in order to reflect real-world conditions more accurately. Jonathan Eaton and Samuel Kortum underlined that a convincing model needed to incorporate the idea of a 'continuum of goods' developed by Dornbusch et al. for both goods and countries. They were able to do so by allowing for an arbitrary (integer) number i of countries, and dealing exclusively with unit labor requirements for each good (one for each point on the unit interval) in each country (of which there are i).<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Eaton|first1=Jonathan|last2=Kortum|first2=Samuel|title=Putting Ricardo to Work\u2020|journal=Journal of Economic Perspectives|date=Spring 2012|volume=26|issue=2|pages=65\u201390|doi=10.1257/jep.26.2.65}}</ref>\n\n===Earlier empirical work===\nTwo of the first tests of comparative advantage were by MacDougall (1951, 1952).<ref>{{cite news | author=MacDougall, G.

In older economic terms, comparative advantage has been opposed by [[mercantilism]] and [[economic nationalism]]. These argue instead that while a country may initially be comparatively disadvantaged in a given industry (such as Japanese cars in the 1950s), countries should shelter and invest in industries until they become globally competitive. Further, they argue that comparative advantage, as stated, is a static theory \u2013 it does not account for the possibility of advantage changing through investment or economic development, and thus does not provide guidance for long-term economic development.\n\nMuch has been written since Ricardo as commerce has evolved and cross-border trade has become more complicated. Today trade policy tends to focus more on \"[[competitive advantage]]\" as opposed to \"comparative advantage\". One of the most in-depth research undertakings on \"competitive advantage\" was conducted in the 1980s as part of the [[Reagan administration]]'s [[Project Socrates]] to establish the foundation for a technology-based competitive strategy development system that could be used for guiding international trade policy.\n\n==Criticism==\nSeveral arguments have been advanced against using comparative advantage as a justification for advocating free trade, and they have gained an audience among economists. For example, [[James Brander]] and [[Barbara Spencer]] demonstrated how, in a strategic setting where a few firms compete for the world market, export subsidies and import restrictions can keep foreign firms from competing with national firms, increasing welfare in the country implementing these so-called strategic trade policies.<ref>{{cite news |last=Krugman |first=Paul R. |title=Is Free Trade Passe? |journal=[[Journal of Economic Perspectives]] |year=1987 |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=131\u201344}}</ref>\n\nHowever, the overwhelming consensus of the economics profession remains that while these arguments against comparative advantage are theoretically valid under certain conditions or assumptions, these assumptions do not usually hold. Thus, these arguments should not be used to guide trade policy.<ref>{{cite news |last=Irwin |first=Douglas. |title=Retrospectives: Challenges to Free Trade |journal=[[Journal of Economic Perspectives]] |year=1991 |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=201\u201308}}</ref> [[Gregory Mankiw]], chairman of the Harvard Economics Department, has stated: \u2033Few propositions command as much consensus among professional economists as that open world trade increases economic growth and raises living standards.\u2033<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2006/05/outsourcing-redux.html| author=Mankiw, N.G. |title=Outsourcing Redux|website= Greg Mankiw's Blog: Random Observations for Students of Economics|date=May 7, 2006}}</ref>\n\nThere are some economists who dispute the claims of the benefit of comparative advantage. [[James K. Galbraith]] has stated that \"free trade has attained the status of a god\" and that \"{{nbsp}}... none of the world's most successful trading regions, including Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and now mainland China, reached their current status by adopting [[neoliberal]] trading rules.\" He argues that \"{{nbsp}}... comparative advantage is based upon the concept of [[constant returns]]: the idea that you can double or triple the output of any good simply by doubling or tripling the inputs. But this is not generally the case. For manufactured products, increasing returns, learning, and technical change are the rule, not the exception; the cost of production falls with experience. With increasing returns, the lowest cost will be incurred by the country that starts earliest and moves fastest on any particular line. Potential competitors have to protect their own industries if they wish them to survive long enough to achieve competitive scale.\"<ref>James K. Galbraith, The Predator State, Free Press, 2008, pp. 68\u201369</ref> According to Galbraith, nations trapped into specializing in agriculture are condemned to perpetual poverty, as agriculture is dependent on land, a finite non-increasing natural resource. Galbraith summarizes: \"Comparative advantage has very little practical use for trade strategy. Diversification, not specialization, is the main path out of underdevelopment, and effective diversification requires a strategic approach to trade policy. It cannot mean walling off the outside world, but it is also a goal not easily pursued under a dogmatic commitment to free trade.\"<ref>{{Cite book|url=|title=The Predator State: How conservatives abandoned the free market and why liberals should too|last=K.|first=Galbraith, James|publisher=|year=2008|isbn=9781416566830|edition=First Free Press hardcover|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/predatorstatehow00galb/page/70 70]|oclc=192109752|author-link=James K.

When the union with Great Britain was formed in 1800, Irish textile industries protected by tariffs were exposed to world markets where England had a comparative advantage in technology, experience and scale of operation which devastated the Irish industry. Ireland was forced to specialize in the export of grain while the displaced Irish labor was forced into subsistence farming and relying on the potato for survival. When the potato blight occurred the resulting famine killed at least one million Irish in one of the worst famines in European history. As Woodham-Smith would later comment, \"the Irish peasant was told to replace the potato by eating his grain, but [[Sir Charles Trevelyan, 1st Baronet|Trevelyan]] once again refused to take any steps to curb the export of food from Ireland. 'Do not encourage the idea of prohibiting exports,' he wrote, on September 3, (1846) 'perfect free trade is the right course'.\"<ref>[[Cecil Woodham-Smith]], ''[[The Great Hunger: Ireland 1845\u20131849]]'', 1962, pp. 49, 100, 118</ref>\n\nFree trade is based on the theory of [[comparative advantage]]. The classical and neoclassical formulations of comparative advantage theory differ in the tools they use but share the same basis and logic. Comparative advantage theory says that market forces lead all factors of production to their best use in the economy. It indicates that international free trade would be beneficial for all participating countries as well as for the world as a whole because they could increase their overall production and consume more by specializing according to their comparative advantages. Goods would become cheaper and available in larger quantities.  Moreover, this specialization would not be the result of chance or political intent, but would be automatic. However according to non-neoclassical economists, the theory is based on assumptions that are neither theoretically nor empirically valid.<ref name=\":28\">{{cite thesis|last1=Schumacher|first1=Reinhard |title=Free Trade and Absolute and Comparative Advantage|date=2012|publisher=University of Potsdam|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U5nPkWSVpzQC&printsec=frontcover&hl=en&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref><ref name=\":27\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sudoc.abes.fr/xslt/DB=2.1/SET=3/TTL=1//CLK?IKT=1016&TRM=Les+fondements+non+neoclassiques+du+protectionnisme&COOKIE=U10178,Klecteurweb,I250,B341720009+,SY,NLECTEUR+WEBOPC,D2.1,Efd7f43b5-38f,A,H,R208.80.154.49,FY|title=Les fondements non neoclassiques du protectionnisme|first=Max|last=Maurin|date=14 April 2019|publisher=|access-date=14 April 2019|via=Library Catalog - www.sudoc.abes.fr}}</ref>\n\n;International mobility of capital and labour\nThe international immobility of labour and capital is essential to the theory of comparative advantage. Without this, there would be no reason for international free trade to be regulated by comparative advantages. Classical and neoclassical economists all assume that labour and capital do not circulate between nations. At the international level, only the goods produced can move freely, with capital and labour trapped in countries. David Ricardo was aware that the international immobility of labour and capital is an indispensable hypothesis. He devoted half of his explanation of the theory to it in his book. He even explained that if labour and capital could move internationally, then comparative advantages could not determine international trade. Ricardo assumed that the reasons for the immobility of the capital would be:<ref name=\":28\" /><ref name=\":27\" />\n{{Quote|text=\"the fancied or real insecurity of capital, when not under the immediate control of its owner, together with the natural disinclination which every man has to quit the country of his birth and connexions, and intrust himself with all his habits fixed, to a strange government and new laws\"}}\n\nNeoclassical economists, for their part, argue that the scale of these movements of workers and capital is negligible. They developed the theory of price compensation by factor that makes these movements superfluous.\nIn practice, however, workers move in large numbers from one country to another. Today, labour migration is truly a global phenomenon. And, with the reduction in transport and communication costs, capital has become increasingly mobile and frequently moves from one country to another. Moreover, the neoclassical assumption that factors are trapped at the national level has no theoretical basis and the assumption of factor price equalisation cannot justify international immobility. Moreover, there is no evidence that factor prices are equal worldwide. Comparative advantages cannot therefore determine the structure of international trade.<ref name=\":28\" /><ref name=\":27\" />\n\nIf they are internationally mobile and the most productive use of factors is in another country, then free trade will lead them to migrate to that country. This will benefit the nation to which they emigrate, but not necessarily the others.\n\n;Externalities\nAn externality is the term used when the price of a product does not reflect its cost or real economic value. The classic negative externality is environmental degradation, which reduces the value of natural resources without increasing the price of the product that has caused them harm. The classic positive externality is technological encroachment, where one company's invention of a product allows others to copy or build on it, generating wealth that the original company cannot capture. If prices are wrong due to positive or negative externalities, free trade will produce sub-optimal results.<ref name=\":28\" /><ref name=\":27\" />\n\nFor example, goods from a country with lax pollution standards will be too cheap. As a result, its trading partners will import too much. And the exporting country will export too much, concentrating its economy too much in industries that are not as profitable as they seem, ignoring the damage caused by pollution.\n\nOn the positive externalities, if an industry generates technological spinoffs for the rest of the economy, then free trade can let that industry be destroyed by foreign competition because the economy ignores its hidden value. Some industries generate new technologies, allow improvements in other industries and stimulate technological advances throughout the economy; losing these industries means losing all industries that would have resulted in the future.<ref name=\":28\" /><ref name=\":27\" />\n\n;Cross-industrial movement of productive resources\nComparative advantage theory deals with the best use of resources and how to put the economy to its best use. But this implies that the resources used to manufacture one product can be used to produce another object. If they cannot, imports will not push the economy into industries better suited to its comparative advantage and will only destroy existing industries.<ref name=\":28\" /><ref name=\":27\" />\n\nFor example, when workers cannot move from one industry to another\u2014usually because they do not have the right skills or do not live in the right place\u2014changes in the economy's comparative advantage will not shift them to a more appropriate industry, but rather to unemployment or precarious and unproductive jobs.<ref name=\":28\" /><ref name=\":27\" />\n\n;Static vs. dynamic gains via international trade\nComparative advantage theory allows for a \"static\" and not a \"dynamic\" analysis of the economy. That is, it examines the facts at a single point in time and determines the best response to those facts at that point in time, given our productivity in various industries. But when it comes to long-term growth, it says nothing about how the facts can change tomorrow and how they can be changed in someone's favour. It does not indicate how best to transform factors of production into more productive factors in the future.<ref name=\":28\" /><ref name=\":27\" />\n\nAccording to theory, the only advantage of international trade is that goods become cheaper and available in larger quantities. Improving the static efficiency of existing resources would therefore be the only advantage of international trade. And the neoclassical formulation assumes that the factors of production are given only exogenously. Exogenous changes can come from population growth, industrial policies, the rate of capital accumulation (propensity for security) and technological inventions, among others. Dynamic developments endogenous to trade such as economic growth are not integrated into Ricardo's theory. And this is not affected by what is called \"dynamic comparative advantage\". In these models, comparative advantages develop and change over time, but this change is not the result of trade itself, but of a change in exogenous factors.<ref name=\":28\" /><ref name=\":27\" />\n\nHowever, the world, and in particular the industrialized countries, are characterized by dynamic gains endogenous to trade, such as technological growth that has led to an increase in the standard of living and wealth of the industrialized world. In addition, dynamic gains are more important than static gains.\n\n;Balanced trade and adjustment mechanisms\nA crucial assumption in both the classical and neoclassical formulation of comparative advantage theory is that trade is balanced, which means that the value of imports is equal to the value of each country's exports. The volume of trade may change, but international trade will always be balanced at least after a certain adjustment period. The balance of trade is essential for theory because the resulting adjustment mechanism is responsible for transforming the comparative advantages of production costs into absolute price advantages. And this is necessary because it is the absolute price differences that determine the international flow of goods. Since consumers buy a good from the one who sells it cheapest, comparative advantages in terms of production costs must be transformed into absolute price advantages. In the case of floating exchange rates, it is the exchange rate adjustment mechanism that is responsible for this transformation of comparative advantages into absolute price advantages. In the case of fixed exchange rates, neoclassical theory suggests that trade is balanced by changes in wage rates.<ref name=\":28\" /><ref name=\":27\" />\n\nSo if trade were not balanced in itself and if there were no adjustment mechanism, there would be no reason to achieve a comparative advantage. However, trade imbalances are the norm and balanced trade is in practice only an exception. In addition, financial crises such as the Asian crisis of the 1990s show that balance of payments imbalances are rarely benign and do not self-regulate. There is no adjustment mechanism in practice. Comparative advantages do not turn into price differences and therefore cannot explain international trade flows.<ref name=\":28\" /><ref name=\":27\" />\n\nThus, theory can very easily recommend a trade policy that gives us the highest possible standard of living in the short term but none in the long term. This is what happens when a nation runs a trade deficit, which necessarily means that it goes into debt with foreigners or sells its existing assets to them. Thus, the nation applies a frenzy of consumption in the short term followed by a long-term decline.\n\n;International trade as bartering\nThe assumption that trade will always be balanced is a corollary of the fact that trade is understood as barter. The definition of international trade as barter trade is the basis for the assumption of balanced trade. Ricardo insists that international trade takes place as if it were purely a barter trade, a presumption that is maintained by subsequent classical and neoclassical economists. The quantity of money theory, which Ricardo uses, assumes that money is neutral and neglects the velocity  of a currency. Money has only one function in international trade, namely as a means of exchange to facilitate trade.<ref name=\":28\" /><ref name=\":27\" />\n\nIn practice, however, the velocity  of circulation is not constant and the quantity of money is not neutral for the real economy. A capitalist world is not characterized by a barter economy but by a market economy. The main difference in the context of international trade is that sales and purchases no longer necessarily have to coincide. The seller is not necessarily obliged to buy immediately. Thus, money is not only a means of exchange. It is above all a means of payment and is also used to store value, settle debts and transfer wealth. Thus, unlike the barter hypothesis of the comparative advantage theory, money is not a commodity like any other. Rather, it is of practical importance to specifically own money rather than any commodity. And money as a store of value in a world of uncertainty has a significant influence on the motives and decisions of wealth holders and producers.<ref name=\":28\" /><ref name=\":27\" />\n\n;Using labour and capital to their full potential\nRicardo and later classical economists assume that labour tends towards full employment and that capital is always fully used in a liberalized economy, because no capital owner will leave its capital unused but will always seek to make a profit from it. That there is no limit to the use of capital is a consequence of Jean-Baptiste Say's law, which presumes that production is limited only by resources and is also adopted by neoclassical economists.<ref name=\":28\" /><ref name=\":27\" />\n\nFrom a theoretical point of view, comparative advantage theory must assume that labour or capital is used to its full potential and that resources limit production. There are two reasons for this: the realization of gains through international trade and the adjustment mechanism. In addition, this assumption is necessary for the concept of opportunity costs. If unemployment (or underutilized resources) exists, there are no opportunity costs, because the production of one good can be increased without reducing the production of another good. Since comparative advantages are determined by opportunity costs in the neoclassical formulation, these cannot be calculated and this formulation would lose its logical basis.<ref name=\":28\" /><ref name=\":27\" />\n\nIf a country's resources were not fully utilized, production and consumption could be increased at the national level without participating in international trade. The whole raison d'\u00eatre of international trade would disappear, as would the possible gains. In this case, a State could even earn more by refraining from participating in international trade and stimulating domestic production, as this would allow it to employ more labour and capital and increase national income. Moreover, any adjustment mechanism underlying the theory no longer works if unemployment exists.<ref name=\":28\" /><ref name=\":27\" />\n\nIn practice, however, the world is characterised by unemployment. Unemployment and underemployment of capital and labour are not a short-term phenomenon, but it is common and widespread. Unemployment and untapped resources are more the rule than the exception.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Business and economics}}\n* [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]]\n* [[Keynesian beauty contest]]\n* [[Resource curse]]\n* [[Revealed comparative advantage]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* {{cite journal | last1 = Bernhofen | first1 = Daniel M | year = 2005 | title = Gottfried haberler's 1930 reformulation of comparative advantage in retrospect | url = | journal = Review of International Economics | volume = 13 | issue = 5| pages = 997\u20131000 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-9396.2005.00550.x}}\n* {{cite journal | last1 = Bernhofen | first1 = Daniel M. | last2 = Brown | first2 = John C. | year = 2004 | title = A Direct Test of the Theory of Comparative Advantage: The Case of Japan | url = | journal = Journal of Political Economy | volume = 112 | issue = 1| pages = 48\u201367 | doi=10.1086/379944| citeseerx = 10.1.1.194.9649 }}\n* {{cite journal | last1 = Bernhofen | first1 = Daniel M. | last2 = Brown | first2 = John C. | year = 2005 | title = An Empirical Assessment of the Comparative Advantage Gains from Trade: Evidence from Japan | url = | journal = American Economic Review | volume = 95 | issue = 1| pages = 208\u201325 | doi=10.1257/0002828053828491}}\n* {{cite journal | last1 = Bernhofen | first1 = Daniel M. | last2 = Brown | first2 = John C. | year = 2016 | title = Testing the General Validity of the Heckscher-Ohlin Theorem | url = | journal = American Economic Journal: Microeconomics | volume = 8 | issue = 4| pages = 54\u201390 | doi=10.1257/mic.20130126}}\n* {{cite journal | last1 = Findlay | first1 = Ronald | year = 1987 | title = Comparative Advantage | url = | journal = The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 514\u201317 }}\n* Markusen, Melvin, Kaempfer and Maskus, \"International Trade: Theory and Evidence\"\n* Hardwick, Khan and Langmead (1990).
