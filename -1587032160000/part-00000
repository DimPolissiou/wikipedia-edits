It is similar to the [[Indian locomotive class WAP-7|WAP-7]] class locomotive but features a different [[gear ratio]], which makes it suitable for heavy freight operations. In November 1998, the [[Chittaranjan Locomotive Works]] (CLW) started producing these with indigenous components. The first of which, named '''Navyug (New Era)''', was produced on 14 November 1998. Like the [[Indian Locomotive Class WAP-5|WAP-5 units]], the WAG-9 has GTO [[thyristor]] converters and three-phase asynchronous motors.\n\nNewer versions of the WAG-9 feature full [[Insulated-gate bipolar transistor]] (IGBT) traction control; the debut model was the ''WAG-9 31248''. The class as a whole is denoted by the WAG-9i prefix in its model number, although there is a technical variant of this class named WAG-9H, with the \"H\" meaning \"Heavy\".\n\nThe WAG-9H/9Hi locomotives are the second heaviest in regular service in India, the only freight-dedicated three-phase AC locomotives in the country, and the only electric locomotives in India fitted with IGBT. They are also the freight locomotives with the highest operational speed in India.\n[[File:BHILAI based WAG9H 31283 standing in Katihar goods yard.jpg|thumb|Bhilai based WAG9H standing at Katihar goods yard]]\n[[File:LDH_based_WAG9HC_32523_with_BCNA_entering_Katihar.jpg|thumb|Ludhiana based WAG9HC with BCNA entering Katihar]]\n[[File:Gomoh based WAG-9 loco - 31049 with BOX - type freight rake.jpg|thumb|280px|Gomoh based WAG-9 loco - 31049 with BOX - type freight rake]]\n[[File:WAG9-31179.jpg|thumb|280px|Indian Railways WAG-9 class AC electric locomotive no. 31179 pauses at Agra Fort railway station (Indian Railways station code AF), at the head of a heavily laden eastbound coal train.]]\n[[File:LGD based WAG-9 Locomotives at Ghatkesar 02.JPG|thumb|280px|[[Lallaguda]] based WAG-9 Locomotives at [[Ghatkesar]]]]\n[[File:WAG 9 - Navshatak.JPG|thumb|280px|WAG 9 - Navshatak]]\n[[File:WAG 9 at Vasai Road Station.jpg|thumb|280px|WAG 9 at [[Vasai Road railway station|Vasai Road]]]]\n\n==Introduction==\nThe WAG-9 [[locomotive]] is referred to as the \"Heavy Haul\" freight locomotive of the Indian Railways (IR). It was conceived in response to the extreme growth in the rail freight transportation sector, which is considered to be of great importance to the growth of the [[economy of India]]. The need for more [[electrification]] and electric locomotives in India had increased. Around 60-65% of the freight haulage of the IR takes place on the electrified section of the Golden Quadrilateral (Indian Railways) and diagonals (which account for 25% of the route). These are very busy routes, so clearance is a necessity. Electrical powers give it a great sectional clearance ability. Thus, these locomotives are important for the Indian Railways.\n\nThese locomotives have entered the [[Western Railway zone]] of [[Mumbai]]. The first 22 units were imported from [[Adtranz]] (ABB). Of these, the first six were fully assembled and rest were in kit form. Again in the kit form, seven were completely knocked down and the rest were partially assembled. CLW started producing these traction motors on 1 November 1999. The units built by ABB have double-pan [[Pantograph (transport)|pantographs]] while the CLW built units have single pan pantographs which are common in India. This class had a capacity to MU several units, but IR restricts them to two, because of dynamic loading restriction on most bridges. Regenerative brakes provide about 260&nbsp;kN of braking effort.\n\nThe WAG-9H also has different application software than the WAG-9. The first WAG-9H was commissioned on 30 June 2000. The #30130 prototype was housed at [[Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose Gomoh railway station|Gomoh]] (GMO). This was then converted back to standard WAG-9 in 2002. This unit has a livery of twin white stripes on green, instead of yellow stripe on green, seen on the other WAG-9(x)s.\n\nThe WAG-9i was introduced in 2010, and was #31215. It was homed at the GMO shed. With IGBT, even if one traction motor failed, other traction motors can function with a total output of 5500&nbsp;hp.\n\nNewer WAG-9 units have \"CLW Glorious 50 years\" marked on their sides. Some WAG-9(x)s are fitted with a solid cowcatcher while others are fitted with grilled cowcatchers. Some have American style flasher lamps while others have Indian style flasher lamps. http://elocos.railnet.gov.in/Study_Material/TSD_3Ph.pdf.\n\n== Operations ==\nWAG-9 has quickly become one of the important locos in the Indian railways. With its higher power, this locomotive has replaced WAG-7 which was the main electric loco before WAG-9's arrival. Applications where twin WAG-7s were required are now handled by a single WAG-9. This includes both leading a long consist and for banking operations.  The regenerative braking capabilities of WAG-9 has also helped reduce the electricity consumption. The original WAG-9 had some wheel slippage incidents while hauling heavy load. This was rectified through the introduction of WAG-9H and subsequently using WAG-9i. This has significantly reduced the issue that were associated with the original version.\n\n<br /> Chittaranjan Locomotive Works (CLW) turned out its first 9,000&nbsp;hp WAG-9 freight locomotive on 31 March 2019, the last day of the financial year. This 9,000&nbsp;hp version of the WAG-9H has been classified by IR as WAG-9 HH. The first H stands for higher axle load and the second H stands for the higher power rating. The class has been allocated a block of serial numbers starting with 90001, the number of the first unit. The decision to upgrade the power output of the WAG-9 was taken to partly meet the demands of the upcoming electrified Western Dedicated Freight Corridor (WDFC). The upgraded locomotive class will also augment hauling capacity on the existing network of the Indian Railways.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.railpost.in/new-9000-hp-wag-9-hh-locomotive-rolls-out-of-clw/|title=New 9,000 hp WAG-9 HH Locomotive Rolls Out of CLW|last=|first=|last2=|date=2019-04-02|website=RailPost.in - Indian Railways News & Analysis|accessdate=2019-04-05|last3=|first3=|last4=|last5=|first5=}}</ref>\n\n== Future Developments ==\nWAG-9s are modified to have high-reach pantographs. This is to enable them carry double-stack containers in electrified sections. In such sections, the Overhead wires are placed in a higher position. Another version with 9000&nbsp;hp is also under development.\n\n==Technical specifications==\nThe WAG-9 technical specifications are:<ref>[http://www.irfca.org/faq/faq-loco2e.html#loco Indian AC electric loco information]</ref>\n{| class=wikitable\n|Traction Motors\n|ABB's 6FRA 6068 (850&nbsp;kW, 2180V, 1283/2484 rpm, 270/310A.

For shunting up to {{convert|15|km/h|abbr=on}}, it can haul {{convert|7500|t}} on grades of 1 in 1000 (0.1%) or less. The atmosphere may be humid and salty. Regenerative braking will provide braking force of no less than {{convert|260|kN|abbr=on}} at {{convert|10|-|62|km/h|abbr=on}} and closer to {{convert|260|kN|abbr=on}} at higher speeds.

It is similar to the [[Indian locomotive class WAP-7|WAP-7]] class locomotive but features a different [[gear ratio]], which makes it suitable for heavy freight operations. In November 1998, the [[Chittaranjan Locomotive Works]] (CLW) started producing these with indigenous components. The first of which, named '''Navyug (New Era)''', was produced on 14 November 1998. Like the [[Indian Locomotive Class WAP-5|WAP-5 units]], the WAG-9 has GTO [[thyristor]] converters and three-phase asynchronous motors.\n\nNewer versions of the WAG-9 feature full [[Insulated-gate bipolar transistor]] (IGBT) traction control; the debut model was the ''WAG-9 31248''. The class as a whole is denoted by the WAG-9i prefix in its model number, although there is a technical variant of this class named WAG-9H, with the \"H\" meaning \"Heavy\".\n\nThe WAG-9H/9Hi locomotives are the second heaviest in regular service in India, the only freight-dedicated three-phase AC locomotives in the country, and the only electric locomotives in India fitted with IGBT. They are also the freight locomotives with the highest operational speed in India.\n[[File:BHILAI based WAG9H 31283 standing in Katihar goods yard.jpg|thumb|Bhilai based WAG9H standing at Katihar goods yard]]\n[[File:LDH_based_WAG9HC_32523_with_BCNA_entering_Katihar.jpg|thumb|Ludhiana based WAG9HC with BCNA entering Katihar]]\n[[File:Gomoh based WAG-9 loco - 31049 with BOX - type freight rake.jpg|thumb|280px|Gomoh based WAG-9 loco - 31049 with BOX - type freight rake]]\n[[File:WAG9-31179.jpg|thumb|280px|Indian Railways WAG-9 class AC electric locomotive no. 31179 pauses at Agra Fort railway station (Indian Railways station code AF), at the head of a heavily laden eastbound coal train.]]\n[[File:LGD based WAG-9 Locomotives at Ghatkesar 02.JPG|thumb|280px|[[Lallaguda]] based WAG-9 Locomotives at [[Ghatkesar]]]]\n[[File:WAG 9 - Navshatak.JPG|thumb|280px|WAG 9 - Navshatak]]\n[[File:WAG 9 at Vasai Road Station.jpg|thumb|280px|WAG 9 at [[Vasai Road railway station|Vasai Road]]]]\n\n==Introduction==\nThe WAG-9 [[locomotive]] is referred to as the \"Heavy Haul\" freight locomotive of the Indian Railways (IR). It was conceived in response to the extreme growth in the rail freight transportation sector, which is considered to be of great importance to the growth of the [[economy of India]]. The need for more [[electrification]] and electric locomotives in India had increased. Around 60-65% of the freight haulage of the IR takes place on the electrified section of the Golden Quadrilateral (Indian Railways) and diagonals (which account for 25% of the route). These are very busy routes, so clearance is a necessity. Electrical powers give it a great sectional clearance ability. Thus, these locomotives are important for the Indian Railways.\n\nThese locomotives have entered the [[Western Railway zone]] of [[Mumbai]]. The first 22 units were imported from [[Adtranz]] (ABB). Of these, the first six were fully assembled and rest were in kit form. Again in the kit form, seven were completely knocked down and the rest were partially assembled. CLW started producing these traction motors on 1 November 1999. The units built by ABB have double-pan [[Pantograph (transport)|pantographs]] while the CLW built units have single pan pantographs which are common in India. This class had a capacity to MU several units, but IR restricts them to two, because of dynamic loading restriction on most bridges. Regenerative brakes provide about 260&nbsp;kN of braking effort.\n\nThe WAG-9H also has different application software than the WAG-9. The first WAG-9H was commissioned on 30 June 2000. The #30130 prototype was housed at [[Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose Gomoh railway station|Gomoh]] (GMO). This was then converted back to standard WAG-9 in 2002. This unit has a livery of twin white stripes on green, instead of yellow stripe on green, seen on the other WAG-9(x)s.\n\nThe WAG-9i was introduced in 2010, and was #31215. It was homed at the GMO shed. With IGBT, even if one traction motor failed, other traction motors can function with a total output of 5500&nbsp;hp.\n\nNewer WAG-9 units have \"CLW Glorious 50 years\" marked on their sides. Some WAG-9(x)s are fitted with a solid cowcatcher while others are fitted with grilled cowcatchers. Some have American style flasher lamps while others have Indian style flasher lamps. http://elocos.railnet.gov.in/Study_Material/TSD_3Ph.pdf.\n\n== Operations ==\nWAG-9 has quickly become one of the important locos in the Indian railways. With its higher power, this locomotive has replaced WAG-7 which was the main electric loco before WAG-9's arrival. Applications where twin WAG-7s were required are now handled by a single WAG-9. This includes both leading a long consist and for banking operations.  The regenerative braking capabilities of WAG-9 has also helped reduce the electricity consumption. The original WAG-9 had some wheel slippage incidents while hauling heavy load. This was rectified through the introduction of WAG-9H and subsequently using WAG-9i. This has significantly reduced the issue that were associated with the original version.\n\n<br /> Chittaranjan Locomotive Works (CLW) turned out its first 9,000&nbsp;hp WAG-9 freight locomotive on 31 March 2019, the last day of the financial year. This 9,000&nbsp;hp version of the WAG-9H has been classified by IR as WAG-9 HH. The first H stands for higher axle load and the second H stands for the higher power rating. The class has been allocated a block of serial numbers starting with 90001, the number of the first unit. The decision to upgrade the power output of the WAG-9 was taken to partly meet the demands of the upcoming electrified Western Dedicated Freight Corridor (WDFC). The upgraded locomotive class will also augment hauling capacity on the existing network of the Indian Railways.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.railpost.in/new-9000-hp-wag-9-hh-locomotive-rolls-out-of-clw/|title=New 9,000 hp WAG-9 HH Locomotive Rolls Out of CLW|last=|first=|last2=|date=2019-04-02|website=RailPost.in - Indian Railways News & Analysis|accessdate=2019-04-05|last3=|first3=|last4=|last5=|first5=}}</ref>\n\n== Future Developments ==\nWAG-9s are modified to have high-reach pantographs. This is to enable them carry double-stack containers in electrified sections. In such sections, the Overhead wires are placed in a higher position. Another version with 9000&nbsp;hp is also under development.\n\n==Technical specifications==\nThe WAG-9 technical specifications are:<ref>[http://www.irfca.org/faq/faq-loco2e.html#loco Indian AC electric loco information]</ref>\n{| class=wikitable\n|Traction Motors\n|ABB's 6FRA 6068 (850&nbsp;kW, 2180V, 1283/2484 rpm, 270/310A.

Borich being a [[drummer]], and Flynn being a [[guitar]]ist, they would occasionally jam.  As their school careers finished, Borich formed the band [[Juice (Australian band)|Juice]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://australianmusicweek.com/artists/juice/ |title=Juice |website=australianmusicweek.com |accessdate=April 8, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160422125942/http://australianmusicweek.com/artists/juice/ |archive-date=22 April 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> while Flynn formed the five-piece [[heavy metal music|metal]] band [[The Hanging Tree (band)|The Hanging Tree]], popular in the Sydney live circuit.<ref>{{cite web|last= |first= |url=http://www.mtv.com/artists/cog-03/ |title=Cog - Biography |website=mtv.com|accessdate=April 8, 2016}}</ref> In 1995, after the release of Juice's debut album, Borich left the band and joined The Hanging Tree. Shortly after the release of their debut, Borich left the band and the country, travelling to the United States to follow a career of session drumming. There Borich did session drumming for a large range of genres, writing songs on his guitar all the while. Flynn, in Sydney, wanted to form a band and contacted Lucius, eventually resulting in the formation of Cog.\n\n===Formation and early releases (1998\u20132003)===\n[[File:Cog @ Metropolis Fremantle (4 6 2009) (3616860140).jpg|thumb|right|300px|Luke Gower at the Metropolis Fremantle in 2009.]]\nInitially, the band was to form in the United States, but Borich chose to travel home. He'd find a disappointed Flynn, who had already sold all his gear in preparation for the move. The drum, bass, and guitar parts for what would become the ''Just Visiting'' EPs were recorded shortly after, in 1998, with Borich assuming bass duties. The vocals would be recorded two years later. To fill out the bass in live shows, Flynn recruited his brother Luke, formerly of the Sydney band Tax. After they formed this legitimate lineup, they toured aggressively, clocking up thousands of kilometres of weekly driving between [[Sydney]] and [[Melbourne]].\n\nTheir first residency, at the ''Forrest Inn Hotel'' in the Sydney suburbs, was without a vocalist. They encouraged people to send them demos for the vocal job, but the band were so unimpressed with the demos that Flynn trained his voice to fill the vacancy. Their breakthrough gig was a Wednesday headlining slot at ''Excelsior Hotel'' in [[Surry Hills]], where they packed out the club consistently for 4 months. They were recognised with a nomination for \"best emerging live band in [[New South Wales|NSW]]\" at the Australian Live Music Awards. In 2001, the band signed with underground label Little Samurai Records and prepared to release the ''Just Visiting Part One'' and ''[[Just Visiting Part Two]]'' EPs.\n\nThe two EPs, despite the slight differences in style between them, were written and recorded at the same time. The band chose not to release the studio session as a full album so they would not lose their debut album virginity, and would get twice the publicity. They grabbed a breakthrough gig just before the release of ''Just Visiting Part One'', supporting [[System of a Down]] at the [[Hordern Pavilion]]. ''Just Visiting Part One'' was released in February 2002 and was still consistently appearing in the [[Australian Recording Industry Association|ARIA]] Top 20 Heavy Rock/Metal singles/EPs chart over 2 years after its release. In July, the song \"Bondi\" was added to Andrew Haug's Triple J 3 Hours of Power Compilation.\n\n''Just Visiting Part Two'' was released in October that same year and was also still appearing in the ARIA Top 20 Heavy Rock/Metal singles/EPs charts after two years. That year, Cog also won \"best emerging live band in NSW\" at the Australian Live Music Awards. After an extensive tour supporting the two EPs, including a slot at the [[Big Day Out]] in 2003, Cog recorded a cover of \"Open Up\", a single released in 1993 by [[Leftfield]] featuring [[John Lydon]]. This song had been a live favourite for the previous year.\n\nShortly afterwards, Cog continued to write and demo for their debut album.\n\n===''The New Normal'' (2004\u20132006)===\nWhile the vast majority of the material for ''[[The New Normal (album)|The New Normal]]'' had already been demoed by late 2003, with some songs first performed live as far back as May 2002, Cog did not have the kind of financial backing needed to record their album as they desired. However, after months of limbo, Cog were signed by Aloha Management ([[Shihad]], [[Killing Heidi]]) and subsequently, former Universal Music Australia head Paul Krige's label Difrnt Music.\n\nDuring the later months of 2004, Cog recorded their debut album, ''The New Normal'', in the small logging town of [[Weed, California]] with  [[Record producer|producer]] [[Sylvia Massy]] ([[System of a Down]] and [[Tool (band)|Tool]]). Shortly afterwards, the band performed a short tour of the east coast and played at the inaugural [[Pyramid Rock Festival]]. The album was released in Australia in April 2005, to a debut of No.&nbsp;19 in the [[ARIA Charts]], and a No.&nbsp;1 debut in the ''Australian Independent Recordings'' (AIR) album charts. ''The New Normal'' was one of the nominees for the 2005 Triple J J Award.\n\nIn support of the album, the band headlined a full Australian tour in April and May with supports from [[Karnivool]] and In the Grey. During July they supported [[Shihad]] on a tour of [[New Zealand]]. During October they toured the country with supports from The Fumes, Grand Fatal, and [[Jakob (band)|Jakob]]. They finished the year with appearances at [[Homebake]], the [[Pyramid Rock Festival]], and the [[Big Day Out]]. Cog supported Australian rock group [[Grinspoon]] at the [[Adelaide]] race event [[Clipsal 500]] and appeared at the [[Rock-It|Rock-It Festival]] in [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] on 19 March with [[Silverchair]], [[Grinspoon]], and Shihad amongst others. During March and April, the band toured the country in support of the final radio single from ''The New Normal'', \"Resonate\".\n\n===''Sharing Space'' (2007\u20132010)===\nCog, from June 2006<ref name=\"cock\">[http://www.fasterlouder.com.au/features/4392/ \"Cog and the Corporate Cock\"], Danica Davis, [http://www.fasterlouder.com.au/ FasterLouder.com.au], 13 April 2006.</ref> onwards, planned to spend a portion of the year in the [[United States]], promoting a release of ''The New Normal'' there through extensive touring. However, this release was pushed back to 2007.\n\nOn 9 January, Cog began to record and write tracks for their second album, entitled ''[[Sharing Space]]'', at Weed, California, once again with [[Sylvia Massy]] producing. They took a break from recording in June, bouncing back to Australia for the ''Boomerang Tour'' for a number of shows. The short tour run included Fremantle, Brisbane, Melbourne and Sydney, where several new songs were premiered, including \"Bird of Feather\" (then titled \"Double Triple\") and \"What If\". Cog toured Australia more extensively in November 2007, in support of \"What If?\", the first single from the new album due April 2008. This tour marked Cog's first trip to North Queensland.\n\nOn 3 November, Cog released \"What If\", the first single from ''Sharing Space'' with the title track to the album as a b-side. On 12 November, this song debuted at No.&nbsp;21 on the physical ARIA singles chart, the only new entry debuting higher being [[Alicia Keys]].\n''Sharing Space'' was released on 12 April 2008. In February, the band announced that they will be touring around [[Australia]] in support of Sharing Space in May and June. They performed shows around the country with two [[New Zealand]] bands, [[Kora (band)|Kora]] and [[Jakob (band)|Jakob]], as well as local [[Melbourne]] prog-rock band Sleep Parade and [[Brisbane]]'s Melodyssey. Despite the conflict and difficulty of the recording process of ''Sharing Space'', Borich commented on the process saying  \u201cYou can\u2019t really put a timeframe on creating art...sometimes you have to struggle through in order to come up with the goods musically. Otherwise it\u2019s not going to have any validity or longevity.\u201d<ref>{{cite web|last= |first= |url=http://www.cog.com.au/biography.html |title=Biography |website=cog.com.au|accessdate=April 8, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn July 2008, Cog performed in [[England]] for the first time at [[Shepherds Bush Empire]] and [[GuilFest]] with [[New Zealand]] band [[Shihad]].<ref name=\"guilfest\">[http://www.guilfest.co.uk/2008/index.php?module=lineup&sid=69856073cf734997246dbfbca731804c GuilFest 2008 Line-up], 6 July 2008.</ref> The band also performed at the 2009 [[Big Day Out]], performing at all the Australian dates. They also expressed interest in releasing ''Sharing Space'' in [[Europe]].\n\nIn 2008, the band had the opportunity to re-release their 2002 EPs ''[[Just Visiting Part One]]'' and ''[[Just Visiting Part Two]]'' as a full album; ''[[Just Visiting (Cog album)|Just Visiting]]'', with the intended track listing and the never previously heard original (long) version of ''Bondi''. [[Lucius Borich]] spent time at ''Studios 301'' mastering the album so the recordings sounded their best. In June and July 2009, the band toured Australia with support from English band [[Oceansize]]. The tour was the band's most successful headlining tour to date.\n\nIn 2010, the band released ''The Sound of Three: 12 Years With You'', a CD/DVD produced by Lucius Borich. Containing a recording from the band's \"Between Oceans\" tour, and a documentary on this history of the band (on the DVD only). The band toured the album in early June; Lucius Borich had hinted in several interviews that these might have been the last shows Cog would play as a band.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fasterlouder.com.au/features/24027/Cog.htm |title=Cog on |publisher=Fasterlouder.com.au |date= |accessdate=23 March 2012}}</ref>\n\nCog played what many had believed to be their last show at The Tivoli in Brisbane on Saturday 12 June 2010, thanking their various crew members one by one between songs. The band finished with \"No Other Way\", the opening track from their second album, ''Sharing Space''. However, the band played four more shows - one at the Full Noise Festival in [[Townsville]], one at a Sydney nightclub, and two smaller shows in the outer Melbourne suburbs of Frankston and Ferntree Gully. Their Sydney show on 22 December 2010 was Cog's last show as a band, though they would reform six years later.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sputnikmusic.com/news.php?newsid=16458 |title=Cog confirm break up |publisher=Sputnikmusic |date= |accessdate=23 March 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Hiatus (2011\u20132016)===\nLucius Borich soon joined [[FloatingMe|Floating Me]], a band featuring ex-members of [[Scary Mother]] and Jon Stockman of [[Karnivool]]. Floating Me released their debut self-titled album in 2011. Flynn and Luke Gower went on to form The Occupants in 2012. Their first single, \"I've Been Thinking\", was released in April 2013. It was followed by an EP in 2014.\n\n===Reunion and ''The Middle''  (2016\u2013present)===\nIn late January 2016, the official Cog Facebook page was updated for the first time in nearly three years with new photos. In the weeks that followed, the band put up entire photo albums of previously-unseen photos taken on tours from over the years. This subsequently lead to speculation regarding the band getting back together. The following month, it was confirmed that Cog would reunite for a run of headlining shows in July 2016.\n\nThroughout 2017, Cog have been working on new material, posting regular updates to the band\u2019s Instagram account of the album\u2019s progress. \n\nThe band's single \"The Middle\" was released in 2018, making it their first new music in ten years.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://instagram.com/p/BcMKImSjkQl/|title=Cog The Middle |publisher=Instagram.com |date= |accessdate=8 December 2017}}</ref> They have since released two more singles titled \"Altered States\"<ref>{{cite web|url= https://musicfeeds.com.au/news/premiere-cog-unleash-epic-new-single-altered-states/|title=Cog Altered States |website=musicfeeds.com.au |date= |accessdate=27 February 2019}}</ref> and \"Drawn Together\", the latter being the focus of the upcoming 2019 Drawn Together Tour.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://musicfeeds.com.au/news/cog-announce-2019-aussie-tour-new-music-coming-soon//|title=Cog Drawn Together |website=musicfeeds.com.au |date= |accessdate=27 February 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n===Albums===\n*''[[The New Normal (album)|The New Normal]]'' (2005)\n*''[[Sharing Space]]'' (2008)\n\n===EPs===\n* ''Pseudo'' (2000)\n* ''[[Just Visiting Part One]]'' (Little Samurai/[[MGM Distribution]], 2002)\n* ''[[Just Visiting Part Two]]'' (Little Samurai/MGM Distribution, 2002) [[ARIA Charts|AUS]] No.&nbsp;90\n* ''[[Open Up (Cog song)|Open Up]]'' (Little Samurai/MGM Distribution, 2003) AUS No.&nbsp;81\n\n===Singles===\n* \"[[Run (Cog song)|Run]]\" (Different Music/MGM Distribution, 2005) AUS No.&nbsp;75\n* \"Resonate\"\n* \"Real Life\"\n* \"What If\" (2007) AUS No.&nbsp;45\n* \"Bird of Feather\" (2008) AUS No.&nbsp;72\n* \"The Middle\" (2018)\n* \"Altered States\" (2018)\n* \"Drawn Together\" (2019)\n\n===Compilations===\n*''[[Just Visiting (Cog album)|Just Visiting]]'' (2008)\n\n===Video albums===\n* \"The Sound of Three: 12 Years With You\" (2010) [[ARIA Charts|AUS DVD Chart]] No.&nbsp;1\n\n===Music videos===\n* \"Paris, Texas\" (2002)\n* \"Open Up\" (2003)\n* \"My Enemy\" (2005)\n* \"Run\" (2005)\n* \"What If\" (2007)\n* \"Bird of Feather\" (2008)\n* \"Are You Interested?\" (2008)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commonscat|Cog (band)}}\n===Official===\n* [http://www.cog.com.au/ Official Website]\n* [http://www.myspace.com/cogrockmusic Official MySpace]\n\n===News===\n*[http://www.news.com.au/adelaidenow/story/0,22606,25596253-16601,00.html Cog A Well-Oiled Machine] by Adam Hine, 6 June 2009\n\n{{Cog}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cog}}\n[[Category:Australian alternative rock groups]]\n[[Category:New South Wales musical groups]]\n[[Category:Musical groups established in 1998]]\n[[Category:Australian progressive metal musical groups]]\n[[Category:Superball Music artists]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use Australian English|date=May 2011}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2011}}\n{{Infobox musical artist\n| name            = Cog\n| image           = Cog @ Metropolis Fremantle (4 6 2009) (3616861086).jpg\n| image_size      = 200px\n| caption         = Flynn Gower at the [[Metropolis Fremantle]] in 2009\n| background      = group_or_band\n| alias           = \n| origin          = [[Sydney]], Australia\n| genre           = [[Progressive rock]], [[alternative rock]], [[math rock]], [[alternative metal]]\n| years_active    = 1998\u20132010, 2016\u2013present\n| label           = Difrnt Music, National Recorder, Little Samurai, [[MGM Distribution]]\n| associated_acts = [[Juice (Australian band)|Juice]], [[The Hanging Tree (band)|The Hanging Tree]], [[Floating Me]], The Occupants\n| website         = [http://www.cog.com.au/ cog.com.au]\n| current_members = [[Flynn Gower]]<br />[[Lucius Borich]]<br />[[Luke Gower]]\n| past_members    = \n}}\n\n'''Cog''' are an [[Australia]]n [[progressive rock]] band that formed in 1998.

Borich being a [[drummer]], and Flynn being a [[guitar]]ist, they would occasionally jam.  As their school careers finished, Borich formed the band [[Juice (Australian band)|Juice]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://australianmusicweek.com/artists/juice/ |title=Juice |website=australianmusicweek.com |accessdate=April 8, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160422125942/http://australianmusicweek.com/artists/juice/ |archive-date=22 April 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> while Flynn formed the five-piece [[heavy metal music|metal]] band [[The Hanging Tree (band)|The Hanging Tree]], popular in the Sydney live circuit.<ref>{{cite web|last= |first= |url=http://www.mtv.com/artists/cog-03/ |title=Cog - Biography |website=mtv.com|accessdate=April 8, 2016}}</ref> In 1995, after the release of Juice's debut album, Borich left the band and joined The Hanging Tree. Shortly after the release of their debut, Borich left the band and the country, travelling to the United States to follow a career of session drumming. There Borich did session drumming for a large range of genres, writing songs on his guitar all the while. Flynn, in Sydney, wanted to form a band and contacted Lucius, eventually resulting in the formation of Cog.\n\n===Formation and early releases (1998\u20132003)===\n[[File:Cog @ Metropolis Fremantle (4 6 2009) (3616860140).jpg|thumb|right|300px|Luke Gower at the Metropolis Fremantle in 2009.]]\nInitially, the band was to form in the United States, but Borich chose to travel home. He'd find a disappointed Flynn, who had already sold all his gear in preparation for the move. The drum, bass, and guitar parts for what would become the ''Just Visiting'' EPs were recorded shortly after, in 1998, with Borich assuming bass duties. The vocals would be recorded two years later. To fill out the bass in live shows, Flynn recruited his brother Luke, formerly of the Sydney band Tax. After they formed this legitimate lineup, they toured aggressively, clocking up thousands of kilometres of weekly driving between [[Sydney]] and [[Melbourne]].\n\nTheir first residency, at the ''Forrest Inn Hotel'' in the Sydney suburbs, was without a vocalist. They encouraged people to send them demos for the vocal job, but the band were so unimpressed with the demos that Flynn trained his voice to fill the vacancy. Their breakthrough gig was a Wednesday headlining slot at ''Excelsior Hotel'' in [[Surry Hills]], where they packed out the club consistently for 4 months. They were recognised with a nomination for \"best emerging live band in [[New South Wales|NSW]]\" at the Australian Live Music Awards. In 2001, the band signed with underground label Little Samurai Records and prepared to release the ''Just Visiting Part One'' and ''[[Just Visiting Part Two]]'' EPs.\n\nThe two EPs, despite the slight differences in style between them, were written and recorded at the same time. The band chose not to release the studio session as a full album so they would not lose their debut album virginity, and would get twice the publicity. They grabbed a breakthrough gig just before the release of ''Just Visiting Part One'', supporting [[System of a Down]] at the [[Hordern Pavilion]]. ''Just Visiting Part One'' was released in February 2002 and was still consistently appearing in the [[Australian Recording Industry Association|ARIA]] Top 20 Heavy Rock/Metal singles/EPs chart over 2 years after its release. In July, the song \"Bondi\" was added to Andrew Haug's Triple J 3 Hours of Power Compilation.\n\n''Just Visiting Part Two'' was released in October that same year and was also still appearing in the ARIA Top 20 Heavy Rock/Metal singles/EPs charts after two years. That year, Cog also won \"best emerging live band in NSW\" at the Australian Live Music Awards. After an extensive tour supporting the two EPs, including a slot at the [[Big Day Out]] in 2003, Cog recorded a cover of \"Open Up\", a single released in 1993 by [[Leftfield]] featuring [[John Lydon]]. This song had been a live favourite for the previous year.\n\nShortly afterwards, Cog continued to write and demo for their debut album.\n\n===''The New Normal'' (2004\u20132006)===\nWhile the vast majority of the material for ''[[The New Normal (album)|The New Normal]]'' had already been demoed by late 2003, with some songs first performed live as far back as May 2002, Cog did not have the kind of financial backing needed to record their album as they desired. However, after months of limbo, Cog were signed by Aloha Management ([[Shihad]], [[Killing Heidi]]) and subsequently, former Universal Music Australia head Paul Krige's label Difrnt Music.\n\nDuring the later months of 2004, Cog recorded their debut album, ''The New Normal'', in the small logging town of [[Weed, California]] with  [[Record producer|producer]] [[Sylvia Massy]] ([[System of a Down]] and [[Tool (band)|Tool]]). Shortly afterwards, the band performed a short tour of the east coast and played at the inaugural [[Pyramid Rock Festival]]. The album was released in Australia in April 2005, to a debut of No.&nbsp;19 in the [[ARIA Charts]], and a No.&nbsp;1 debut in the ''Australian Independent Recordings'' (AIR) album charts. ''The New Normal'' was one of the nominees for the 2005 Triple J J Award.\n\nIn support of the album, the band headlined a full Australian tour in April and May with supports from [[Karnivool]] and In the Grey. During July they supported [[Shihad]] on a tour of [[New Zealand]]. During October they toured the country with supports from The Fumes, Grand Fatal, and [[Jakob (band)|Jakob]]. They finished the year with appearances at [[Homebake]], the [[Pyramid Rock Festival]], and the [[Big Day Out]]. Cog supported Australian rock group [[Grinspoon]] at the [[Adelaide]] race event [[Clipsal 500]] and appeared at the [[Rock-It|Rock-It Festival]] in [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] on 19 March with [[Silverchair]], [[Grinspoon]], and Shihad amongst others. During March and April, the band toured the country in support of the final radio single from ''The New Normal'', \"Resonate\".\n\n===''Sharing Space'' (2007\u20132010)===\nCog, from June 2006<ref name=\"cock\">[http://www.fasterlouder.com.au/features/4392/ \"Cog and the Corporate Cock\"], Danica Davis, [http://www.fasterlouder.com.au/ FasterLouder.com.au], 13 April 2006.</ref> onwards, planned to spend a portion of the year in the [[United States]], promoting a release of ''The New Normal'' there through extensive touring. However, this release was pushed back to 2007.\n\nOn 9 January, Cog began to record and write tracks for their second album, entitled ''[[Sharing Space]]'', at Weed, California, once again with [[Sylvia Massy]] producing. They took a break from recording in June, bouncing back to Australia for the ''Boomerang Tour'' for a number of shows. The short tour run included Fremantle, Brisbane, Melbourne and Sydney, where several new songs were premiered, including \"Bird of Feather\" (then titled \"Double Triple\") and \"What If\". Cog toured Australia more extensively in November 2007, in support of \"What If?\", the first single from the new album due April 2008. This tour marked Cog's first trip to North Queensland.\n\nOn 3 November, Cog released \"What If\", the first single from ''Sharing Space'' with the title track to the album as a b-side. On 12 November, this song debuted at No.&nbsp;21 on the physical ARIA singles chart, the only new entry debuting higher being [[Alicia Keys]].\n''Sharing Space'' was released on 12 April 2008. In February, the band announced that they will be touring around [[Australia]] in support of Sharing Space in May and June. They performed shows around the country with two [[New Zealand]] bands, [[Kora (band)|Kora]] and [[Jakob (band)|Jakob]], as well as local [[Melbourne]] prog-rock band Sleep Parade and [[Brisbane]]'s Melodyssey. Despite the conflict and difficulty of the recording process of ''Sharing Space'', Borich commented on the process saying  \u201cYou can\u2019t really put a timeframe on creating art...sometimes you have to struggle through in order to come up with the goods musically.

{"title_page": "Dashboard (business)", "text_new": "[[File:3 Dashboards.JPG|thumb|200px|Business Dashboards.]]\n\nA '''dashboard''' is a type of [[graphical user interface]] which often provides at-a-glance views of [[key performance indicators]] (KPIs) relevant to a particular objective or business process. In other usage, \"dashboard\" is another name for \"progress report\" or \"report.\"\n\nThe \"dashboard\" is often displayed on a web page which is linked to a database that allows the report to be constantly updated. For example, a manufacturing dashboard may show numbers related to productivity such as number of parts manufactured, or number of failed quality inspections per hour. Similarly, a human resources dashboard may show numbers related to staff recruitment, retention and composition, for example number of open positions, or average days or cost per recruitment.<ref name=\"Briggs\">{{cite web|url=http://www.targetdashboard.com/site/Dashboard-Best-Practice/Management-Report-and-Dashboard-best-practice-index.aspx|title=Management Reports & Dashboard Best Practice|last=Briggs|first=Jonathan|publisher=Target Dashboard|accessdate=18 February 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe term dashboard originates from the [[automobile]] [[dashboard]] where drivers monitor the major functions at a glance via the instrument cluster.\n\n==Benefits==\nDigital dashboards allow managers to monitor the contribution of the various departments in their organization. To gauge exactly how well an organization is performing overall, digital dashboards allow you to capture and report specific data points from each department within the organization, thus providing a \"snapshot\" of performance.\n\nBenefits of using digital dashboards include:<ref name=\"Briggs\" /><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Koch, Chris.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1132366890|title=Introduction to Information Technology|date=2018|publisher=EDTECH|isbn=978-1-83947-240-4|oclc=1132366890}}</ref>\n\n*Visual presentation of performance [[wikt:measures|measures]]\n*Ability to identify and correct negative trends\n*Measure efficiencies/inefficiencies\n*Ability to generate detailed reports showing new trends\n*Ability to make more informed decisions based on collected [[business intelligence]]\n*Align strategies and organizational goals\n*Saves time compared to running multiple reports\n*Gain total visibility of all systems instantly\n*Quick identification of data outliers and correlations\n\n==Classification==\nDashboards can be broken down according to role and are either [[strategic]], analytical, operational, or informational.<ref>Stephen Few, ''Information Dashboard Design: The Effective Visual Communication of Data'' (O'Reilly, 2006)</ref> Strategic dashboards support managers at any level in an organization, and provide the quick overview that decision makers need to monitor the health and opportunities of the business. Dashboards of this type focus on high level measures of performance, and forecasts. Strategic dashboards benefit from static snapshots of data (daily, weekly, monthly, and quarterly) that are not constantly changing from one moment to the next. Dashboards for analytical purposes often include more context, comparisons, and history, along with subtler performance evaluators. Analytical dashboards typically support interactions with the data, such as drilling down into the underlying details. Dashboards for monitoring operations are often designed differently from those that support strategic decision making or data analysis and often require monitoring of activities and events that are constantly changing and might require attention and response at a moment's notice.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Types of dashboards==\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2020}}\nDigital dashboards may be laid out to track the flows inherent in the business processes that they monitor. Graphically, users may see the high-level processes and then [[data drilling|drill down]] into low level data. This level of detail is often buried deep within the corporate enterprise and otherwise unavailable to the senior executives.\n\nThree main types of digital dashboard dominate the market today: stand alone software applications, web-browser based applications, and desktop applications also known as [[desktop widgets]].

In other usage, \"dashboard\" is another name for \"progress report\" or \"report.\"\n\nThe \"dashboard\" is often displayed on a web page which is linked to a database that allows the report to be constantly updated. For example, a manufacturing dashboard may show numbers related to productivity such as number of parts manufactured, or number of failed quality inspections per hour. Similarly, a human resources dashboard may show numbers related to staff recruitment, retention and composition, for example number of open positions, or average days or cost per recruitment.<ref name=\"Briggs\">{{cite web|url=http://www.targetdashboard.com/site/Dashboard-Best-Practice/Management-Report-and-Dashboard-best-practice-index.aspx|title=Management Reports & Dashboard Best Practice|last=Briggs|first=Jonathan|publisher=Target Dashboard|accessdate=18 February 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe term dashboard originates from the [[automobile]] [[dashboard]] where drivers monitor the major functions at a glance via the instrument cluster.\n\n==Benefits==\nDigital dashboards allow managers to monitor the contribution of the various departments in their organization. To gauge exactly how well an organization is performing overall, digital dashboards allow you to capture and report specific data points from each department within the organization, thus providing a \"snapshot\" of performance.\n\nBenefits of using digital dashboards include:<ref name=\"Briggs\" />\n*Visual presentation of performance [[wikt:measures|measures]]\n*Ability to identify and correct negative trends\n*Measure efficiencies/inefficiencies\n*Ability to generate detailed reports showing new trends\n*Ability to make more informed decisions based on collected [[business intelligence]]\n*Align strategies and organizational goals\n*Saves time compared to running multiple reports\n*Gain total visibility of all systems instantly\n*Quick identification of data outliers and correlations\n\n==Classification==\nDashboards can be broken down according to role and are either [[strategic]], analytical, operational, or informational.<ref>Stephen Few, ''Information Dashboard Design: The Effective Visual Communication of Data'' (O'Reilly, 2006)</ref> Strategic dashboards support managers at any level in an organization, and provide the quick overview that decision makers need to monitor the health and opportunities of the business. Dashboards of this type focus on high level measures of performance, and forecasts. Strategic dashboards benefit from static snapshots of data (daily, weekly, monthly, and quarterly) that are not constantly changing from one moment to the next. Dashboards for analytical purposes often include more context, comparisons, and history, along with subtler performance evaluators. Analytical dashboards typically support interactions with the data, such as drilling down into the underlying details. Dashboards for monitoring operations are often designed differently from those that support strategic decision making or data analysis and often require monitoring of activities and events that are constantly changing and might require attention and response at a moment's notice.\n\n==Types of dashboards==\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2020}}\nDigital dashboards may be laid out to track the flows inherent in the business processes that they monitor. Graphically, users may see the high-level processes and then [[data drilling|drill down]] into low level data. This level of detail is often buried deep within the corporate enterprise and otherwise unavailable to the senior executives.\n\nThree main types of digital dashboard dominate the market today: stand alone software applications, web-browser based applications, and desktop applications also known as [[desktop widgets]]. The last are driven by a [[Software widget|widget engine]].\n\nSpecialized dashboards may track all corporate functions.

It was released on August 10, 2018, through [[Young Money Entertainment]], [[Cash Money Records]] and [[Republic Records]]. It is Minaj's first album in nearly four years, following ''[[The Pinkprint]]'' (2014). The rapper started recording the album in late 2016, and throughout 2017 and 2018, she collaborated with a handful of producers and songwriters to reach her desired sound. It features guest appearances by rappers [[Eminem]], [[Foxy Brown (rapper)|Foxy Brown]], [[Future (rapper)|Future]], [[Swae Lee]], and [[Lil Wayne]]; and singers [[Ariana Grande]], [[Labrinth]], and [[The Weeknd]]. Musically, it is a [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] album that incorporates elements of [[Pop music|pop]] and [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]].\n\nThe album's release date was delayed before ultimately being released a week ahead of schedule. It was supported by four singles: the [[lead single]], \"[[Chun-Li (song)|Chun-Li]]\", released on April 12, 2018; \"[[Bed (Nicki Minaj song)|Bed]]\", released on June 14, \"[[Barbie Dreams]]\" released on August 14 and a remix of \"[[Good Form (song)|Good Form]]\" on December 4. \"[[Rich Sex (Nicki Minaj song)|Rich Sex]]\" was released as a [[promotional single]] on June 11. \"[[Barbie Tingz]]\" was released alongside the lead single, but this single would only be featured on the Target exclusive version. Music videos for album tracks \"[[Ganja Burn]]\" and \"Hard White\" were also released. To further promote the album's release, Minaj launched her own radio show, titled Queen Radio, which aired on [[Beats 1]], and made several television appearances and live performances. Minaj began the [[The Nicki Wrld Tour|Nicki Wrld Tour]] with the late American rapper [[Juice Wrld]] in February 2019.\n\n''Queen'' received generally positive reviews from [[Music criticism|music critics]] who praised Minaj's rapping style, though many criticized the album's length, lyrical content and lack of direction. It debuted at number two on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] with 1,000 [[album-equivalent unit]]s, of which 78,0 came from pure album sales. It charted within the top ten in major music markets, such as Muhosransk, Russia, Ukraine, , New Zealand, Norway, Switzerland, and the .

It was released on August 10, 2018, through [[Young Money Entertainment]], [[Cash Money Records]] and [[Republic Records]]. It is Minaj's first album in nearly four years, following ''[[The Pinkprint]]'' (2014). The rapper started recording the album in late 2016, and throughout 2017 and 2018, she collaborated with a handful of producers and songwriters to reach her desired sound. It features guest appearances by rappers [[Eminem]], [[Foxy Brown (rapper)|Foxy Brown]], [[Future (rapper)|Future]], [[Swae Lee]], and [[Lil Wayne]]; and singers [[Ariana Grande]], [[Labrinth]], and [[The Weeknd]]. Musically, it is a [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] album that incorporates elements of [[Pop music|pop]] and [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]].\n\nThe album's release date was delayed before ultimately being released a week ahead of schedule. It was supported by four singles: the [[lead single]], \"[[Chun-Li (song)|Chun-Li]]\", released on April 12, 2018; \"[[Bed (Nicki Minaj song)|Bed]]\", released on June 14, \"[[Barbie Dreams]]\" released on August 14 and a remix of \"[[Good Form (song)|Good Form]]\" on December 4. \"[[Rich Sex (Nicki Minaj song)|Rich Sex]]\" was released as a [[promotional single]] on June 11. \"[[Barbie Tingz]]\" was released alongside the lead single, but this single would only be featured on the Target exclusive version. Music videos for album tracks \"[[Ganja Burn]]\" and \"Hard White\" were also released. To further promote the album's release, Minaj launched her own radio show, titled Queen Radio, which aired on [[Beats 1]], and made several television appearances and live performances. Minaj began the [[The Nicki Wrld Tour|Nicki Wrld Tour]] with the late American rapper [[Juice Wrld]] in February 2019.\n\n''Queen'' received generally positive reviews from [[Music criticism|music critics]] who praised Minaj's rapping style, though many criticized the album's length, lyrical content and lack of direction. It debuted at number two on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] with 185,000 [[album-equivalent unit]]s, of which 78,000 came from pure album sales. It charted within the top ten in major music markets, such as Australia, Canada, Netherlands, Ireland, New Zealand, Norway, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. The album was certified platinum by the [[RIAA]] in January 2019.<ref name=\"riaa.com\">https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&ar=NICKI+MINAJ&ti=QUEEN</ref>\n\n==Background and development==\nFollowing the release of her third studio album ''[[The Pinkprint]]'' in 2014 and the end of [[The Pinkprint Tour]] in August 2015, Minaj went into [[Hot 97]]'s ''[[Ebro in the Morning]]'' in October 2016, where she was asked for details about her upcoming album, responding, \"The album is so freaking epic, but it's a journey right.
